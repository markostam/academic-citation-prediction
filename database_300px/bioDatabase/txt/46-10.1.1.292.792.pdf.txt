ABSTRACT
A decade ago, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database was established at the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The original
objective of GEO was to serve as a public reposi-
tory for high-throughput gene expression data
generated mostly by microarray technology.
However, the research community quickly applied
microarrays to non-gene-expression studies,
including examination of genome copy number vari-
ation and genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding
proteins. Because the GEO database was designed
with a flexible structure, it was possible to quickly
adapt the repository to store these data types.
More recently, as the microarray community
switches to next-generation sequencing
technologies, GEO has again adapted to host
these data sets. Today, GEO stores over 20 000
microarray- and sequence-based functional
genomics studies, and continues to handle the
majority of direct high-throughput data submissions
from the research community. Multiple mechanisms
are provided to help users effectively search,
browse, download and visualize the data at the
level of individual genes or entire studies. This
paper describes recent database enhancements,
including new search and data representation
tools, as well as a brief review of how the commu-
nity uses GEO data. GEO is freely accessible at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.
INTRODUCTION
In 2000, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
was established by the National Center for Biotechnology
Information at the National Library of Medicine (1).
GEO was originally built to archive the burgeoning
volumes of high-throughput gene expression data begin-
ning to be produced by the research community at that
time. While GEO was originally established to host gene
expression data, the database has evolved to host other
data types, including comparative genomic analyses, chro-
matin immunoprecipitation proﬁling that characterizes
genome–protein interactions, non-coding RNA proﬁling,
SNP genotyping and genome methylation status analyses.
Table 1 provides a breakdown of the study types and
technologies hosted by GEO.
As microarrays became used routinely in almost every
area of biomedical research, the Minimum Information
About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) guidelines
were proposed (2). These guidelines outline the
minimum information that should be included when
describing a microarray experiment to ensure that the
data can be interpreted by others. In 2002, the Nature
journals announced that they supported this proposal
and that authors were henceforth required to deposit
microarray data in either the GEO or ArrayExpress (3)
public repositories so that anyone could freely access and
critically evaluate the data discussed in manuscripts (4).
Many other journals similarly adopted this requirement.
It is for this reason that GEO and ArrayExpress have
experienced remarkable growth. Today, GEO archives ap-
proximately 20 000 studies comprising 500 000 samples,
33 billion individual abundance measurements, for over
1300 organisms, submitted by 8000 laboratories from
around the world and supporting data for over 10 000
published manuscripts.
Since its inception, many aspects of the GEO database
and operating procedures have undergone major revisions
and development, including:
(i) database modiﬁcations to support evolving data
types,

(ii) increasingly stringent submission requirements, con-
comitant with developing community standards like
MIAME,
(iii) enhanced submission formats that ease the burden
on submitters and promote well-annotated
MIAME-compliant data and
(iv) improved indexing and analysis tools that help users
more easily locate information relevant to their
interests.
A timeline summarizing database growth and major de-
velopments over the last 10 years, including recent en-
hancements, is provided in Figure 1.
DATABASE STRUCTURE AND DATA FLOW
The overarching design and organization of GEO remains
largely unchanged from previous descriptions (5).
Platform, Sample and Series records continue to be the
core submitter-supplied objects, while DataSet records
represent curated studies that form the basis of GEO’s
advanced data display and analysis tools. Information
describing the objects, their content and relationships is
provided at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/
overview.html.
Primary database: submitter-supplied Platform, Sample
and Series records
A Platform record is composed of a summary description
of the array or sequencer and, for array-based Platforms, a
data table deﬁning the array template. A Sample record is
composed of a description of the biological material, the
experimental protocols to which it was subjected and a
data table containing abundance measurements for each
feature on the corresponding Platform table. A Series
record deﬁnes a set of related Samples considered to be
part of a study and describes the overall study aim and
design.
We continue to take advantage of the ﬂexible nature of
the primary database which facilitates capture of a wide
variety of rapidly developing heterogeneous data types.
The tabular data from original submissions are not fully
normalized in the database but rather are stored as plain
text tab-delimited tables. While these tables can in prin-
ciple contain any number of rows and columns, a suite of
validation checks performed at the time of upload ensures
that they meet basic format and content requirements,
which in turn facilitates extraction of core elements to
the secondary database. The validation rules can be
easily modiﬁed to quickly accommodate novel data
types and evolving curation standards. Corresponding
raw data ﬁles are linked from each record and stored on
FTP servers. Series summaries, biological sample descrip-
tions, treatments and protocol metadata are stored in
speciﬁed ﬁelds within database tables and have appropri-
ate relations and restrictions. Unique and stable accession
numbers are assigned to each record.
Secondary databases: curated DataSets and Proﬁles
Although the submitter-supplied objects in the primary
database are very heterogeneous with regards to content,
style and level of metadata detail, the array-based expres-
sion data generally share a common set of elements that
can be extracted and further processed. These include:
(i) sequence identity tracking information of each
feature on the Platform,
(ii) normalized expression measurements and
(iii) text describing the biological source and experimen-
tal aim.
This information is extracted from the submitter-supplied
records and organized into an upper-level object called a
GEO DataSet. A DataSet represents a summarized collec-
tion of consistently processed experimentally related
Sample records categorized according to experimental
variables. GEO Proﬁles are derived from GEO
DataSets. A GEO Proﬁle consists of the expression meas-
urements for an individual gene across all Samples in a
DataSet. Genes in GEO Proﬁles are periodically
re-annotated according to the latest information in
Entrez Gene and UniGene, an important consideration
given the dynamic nature of gene annotations. DataSets
and Proﬁles are a means for transforming diverse styles of
incoming data into a relatively standardized format upon
which downstream data analysis and data display tools
are built.
SUBMISSION PROCEDURES, FORMATS AND
STANDARDS
Much effort continues to be invested into making the
deposit process as simple as possible for submitters,

while not compromising the quality of the information
supplied. A spreadsheet-based format called GEOarchive
has emerged as GEO’s most popular deposit method for
both array and next-generation sequence submissions.
GEOarchive spreadsheets are easy to assemble, and
enable rapid batch deposit of both large and small
studies. Generic GEOarchive templates are provided, as
well as templates tailored for speciﬁc data types.
Web-based submission forms are also supported, as are
plain text and XML formats. All these submission
methods can capture all components of the MIAME
checklist. The GEO curation team is available to
support submitters deposit their data should the need
arise.
All submissions are syntactically validated for correct
document structure, organization and provision of basic
MIAME elements. Curators also review the content of
each submission, aiming to ensure that sufﬁcient informa-
tion has been supplied to allow general interpretation of
the study. When any problems are identiﬁed, such as
corrupt ﬁles or missing components, a curator will work
with the submitter until the issues are resolved. Despite
these checks, it should be noted that submitters have
ultimate responsibility for the content and accuracy of

their records. If submitters notice errors or want to make
adjustments to their records, they are free to do so at any
time using online update tools.
Submitters can keep their records in private status until
a manuscript describing the data is published. Submitters
are invited to create a reviewer URL and include it with
their manuscript when they send it to journals for review.
This URL allows anonymous, conﬁdential access to the
private GEO records cited in the paper, enabling reviewers
to download and critically evaluate the data.
Next-generation sequence data submissions
GEO accepts next-generation sequence data for studies
that examine gene expression, genome–protein inter-
actions, genome methylation and gene regulation.
Submissions are organized similarly to array-based sub-
missions and all standard GEO administrative procedures
are applied, full details are provided at http://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html. GEO hosts the processed
and analyzed sequence data, together with sample and
study metadata; raw data ﬁles are brokered to and
linked with NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA)
database (6), ensuring that these sequence data are
integrated with NCBI’s collection of sequence-speciﬁc
resources.
METHODS TO EXPLORE AND RETRIEVE DATA
Given the huge volumes and wide scope of experiment
types represented in GEO, it is crucial to provide robust
tools that allow users to easily locate and access informa-
tion relevant to their interests.
Query
Queries may be performed at the GEO DataSets and GEO
Proﬁles search interfaces (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gds and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoproﬁles, respect-
ively). A simple keyword search is often sufﬁcient to locate
relevant data. However, GEO data are extensively indexed
under many separate ﬁelds, meaning that users can reﬁne
their search by constructing ﬁelded queries. Advanced
Search pages have recently been developed for the GEO
DataSets and GEO Proﬁles databases. These pages greatly
assist users to construct complex multi-part ﬁelded search
statements. Alternatively, users can write and execute their
own search statements directly in the search boxes. A full
listing of all indexed ﬁelds, with examples and tips,
is provided at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/
qqtutorial.html. Examples of indexed ﬁelds include
DataSet Type, Gene Symbol, Gene Ontology (GO)
terms, Chromosome and Base Position. The search ﬁelds
are not restricted to descriptive metadata, they can also be
used to locate genes ﬂagged as having interesting gene
expression patterns. For example, to ﬁnd genes that
exhibit differential expression with respect to age or devel-
opment stage in mouse, users could query GEO Proﬁles
with:
(age[Flag Information] OR development stage[Flag
Information]) AND mouse[Organism].
Additional query approaches are provided on GEO
DataSet records to help users locate genes of interest.
These include a tool that allows the user to perform
t-tests with varying levels of signiﬁcance on selected sets
of Samples, as well as pre-computed cluster heatmap
images that may be queried for speciﬁc genes.
Sequence-based queries may be performed using the
GEO BLAST interface.
Browse
The DataSet Browser is located at http://www.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser.
Download
Complete GEO records and raw data ﬁles are freely avail-
able for bulk download from the GEO FTP site.
High-throughput ﬁle transfer through Aspera Connect is
also supported. Data are available in multiple formats
including tab-delimited tables, plain text and XML. Raw
data ﬁles are provided in native format where possible.
Additional mechanisms are provided to enable
download of more focused sets of data. For example,
URLs can be constructed to retrieve metadata ﬁles for
speciﬁc records and annotated gene expression values
can be downloaded from GEO Proﬁles results pages.
Download options are detailed at http://www.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/geo/info/download.html.
Programmatic access
Programmatic access to metadata is supported through a
suite of NCBI programs called the Entrez Programming
Utilities. These tools allow users to develop pipelines that
locate and download data of interest.
Data display
Various graphical renderings are provided to help users
identify data of interest. GEO Proﬁle charts portray the
expression behavior of one gene across all Samples in a
DataSet. The charts present several categories of informa-
tion including expression measurement values, expression
measurement rankings and an outline of the experimental
design and variables. A user can look at a chart and
quickly assess whether gene activity is shifting according
to experimental conditions. Display of entire DataSets is
facilitated through several types of precomputed cluster
heatmaps. These clusters are interactive in that the user
can search for speciﬁc genes, or highlight speciﬁc areas
using a moveable selector box, and then download those
regions as a text ﬁle or link to corresponding GEO
Proﬁles. Next-generation sequence data presents new chal-
lenges for data display. Hundreds of GEO ChIP-seq and
RNA-seq Samples have been selected for re-processing by
NCBI’s new Epigenomics resource (7) at http://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/epigenomics. Once migrated to the
Epigenomics resource, these data undergo advanced
curation and are made available for review as
precomputed tracks on genome browsers.
D1008 Nucleic Acids Research, 2011, Vol. 39, Database issue
Links
Extensive internal and external links are applied to GEO
data. Internal links help the user discover related gene
expression Proﬁles. For example, Proﬁle Neighbor links
retrieve genes that show a similar gene expression
pattern to the chosen Proﬁle within a DataSet,
Chromosome Neighbor links connect genes that are phys-
ically close to each other on the chromosome to help in-
vestigate gene expression neighborhoods, and Sequence
Neighbor links gather Proﬁles from across all DataSets
that are related by nucleotide sequence similarity.
Inter-database links provide reciprocal connections to cor-
responding information in other NCBI databases
including Gene, PubMed and GenBank (8).
HOW DOES THE COMMUNITY USE GEO DATA?
As the number of GEO data sets increases, so does the
opportunity to aggregate and use the data in a much
broader context than that for which it was originally
intended. GEO typically receives over 40 000 web hits
and 10 000 bulk FTP downloads per day. A review of
the literature reveals over 1000 publications in which re-
searchers describe how they applied data they found in
GEO to their own studies, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/geo/info/ucitations.html. Many of these publications
report how GEO data were used to verify gene expression
signatures of individual genes in speciﬁc cell types or
under speciﬁc conditions, providing evidence to support
conclusions in the authors’ own study (9). Other authors
incorporate GEO data into their own analyses, such as
using GEO data as controls or training sets within their
own study (10). The huge volumes of data present
bioinformaticians with a wealth of test material for de-
veloping new statistical algorithms (11) or analysis
strategies, including modeling gene networks, predicting
gene function and regulation (12) and identifying disease
and toxicity predictors (13). Others have attempted to
deﬁne systems-wide relationships and maps between
GEO expression data and other data types such as gene
pathways (14,15) and ontologies (16). Many subject-
speciﬁc and/or added-value databases have been created
using GEO data, targeting speciﬁc audiences, or present-
ing the data in alternative formats (17–19). Despite the
heterogeneity of data types and experimental designs,
many users have been able to perform powerful
meta-analyses across thousands of independently-
submitted GEO Samples (20,21). It can be anticipated
that as public high-throughput functional genomic data
sets continue to accumulate, third-party users will
exploit these data in ever-more innovative ways.
CONCLUSIONS
Over the past decade, NCBI’s GEO database has served as
the major public archive for high-throughput microarray-
and sequence-based functional genomic data sets. Aside
from archiving, cross-linking and making vast amounts
of data freely available for download, GEO also
provides several user-friendly web-based tools and
strategies to assist users query and analyze these data.
While GEO represents a unifying resource for thou-
sands of valuable public functional genomics studies, sig-
niﬁcant challenges remain in achieving maximum beneﬁt
from these data. Those challenges include enabling better
integration and cross-comparison of diverse data sets,
data types and data resources and correlating the data
with phenotype information. GEO will continue to be de-
veloped and reﬁned towards achieving these goals, as well
as improving the accessibility and usability of the data for
as broad an audience as possible.
