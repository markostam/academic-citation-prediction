Implicated in the Normal Positioning of the Great Arteries

Abstract—Congenital heart defects frequently involve a failure of outflow tract (OFT) formation during development. We
analyzed the remodeling of the OFT, using the y96-Myf5-nlacZ-16 transgene, which marks a subpopulation of
myocardial cells of the pulmonary trunk. Expression analyses of reporter transcript and protein suggest that the
myocardial wall of the OFT rotates before and during the formation of the great arteries. Rotational movement was
confirmed by Di-I injection experiments with cultured embryos. We subsequently examined the expression of the
transgene in mouse models for OFT defects. In hearts with persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), double outlet right
ventricle (DORV), or transposition of the great arteries, rotation of the myocardial wall of the OFT is arrested or fails
to initiate. This is observed in Splotch (Pax3) mutants with PTA or DORV and may be a result of defects in neural crest
migration, known to affect OFT septation. However, in Pitx2c mutant embryos, where cardiac neural crest cells are
present in the heart, PTA and DORV are again associated with a rotation defect. This is also seen in Pitx2c mutants,
which have transposition of the great arteries. Because Pitx2c is involved in left–right signaling, these results suggest
that embryonic laterality affects rotation of the myocardial wall during OFT maturation. We propose that failure of
normal rotation of OFT myocardium may underlie major forms of congenital heart disease. (Circ Res.
2006;98:421-428.)

Congenital heart defects are observed in 0.8% of childrenin developed countries and are responsible for more than
20% of spontaneous abortions and 10% of all stillbirths.1,2
Many of these defects are caused by abnormal development
of the outflow region (also called conotruncal region) of the
heart, leading to malformations such as persistent truncus
arteriosus (PTA), double outlet right ventricle (DORV), or
transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Experiments on
avian and mammalian embryos have shown that myocardium
of the outflow tract (OFT) is derived from pharyngeal
mesoderm.3–5 In the mouse, this has been described as the
anterior heart field,3 which also contributes myocardium to
the right ventricle6 and is itself part of a larger second heart
field.7 In the chick embryo, it has been shown that the
vascular smooth muscle tunic of the aorta and pulmonary
trunk, in addition to myocardium of the outflow region, is
derived from pharyngeal mesoderm.8 Moreover, its ablation
leads to OFT defects such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and
pulmonary atresia.9
As development proceeds, the single OFT undergoes
remodeling into separate pulmonary and aortic arteries. This
process involves interactions between diverse cell types,
including myocardium, endocardium, and neural crest cells.10
Endocardial cells respond to signals from the overlying
myocardium and undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transformation to form the conotruncal cushions.11 Neural
crest cells, which play an essential role in the normal
septation of the heart,12 invade the extracellular matrix of the
cushions and participate in aortico-pulmonary septation. In
the chick, cardiac neural crest ablation leads to OFT defects
including TOF, PTA, DORV, and interrupted aortic arch.13 In
the mouse, Splotch mutations, known to result from disrup-
tion or deletion of the Pax3 gene, give rise to a similar
spectrum of conotruncal defects, secondary to a neural crest
cell migration defect.14–16 Recently, cardiac neural crest
ablation has been shown to affect formation of OFT myocar-
dium from pharyngeal mesoderm.17 Pitx2c mutant mice also
have conotruncal defects.18 Pitx2c confers embryonic left–
right signaling to asymmetrically developing organs.19 Pitx2c
is expressed asymmetrically in pharyngeal mesoderm and has
been implicated in patterning of OFT myocardium.20,21

Classic morphological studies of the developing chick
heart have shown torsion of the OFT, which, when physically
interrupted, leads to malposition of the great arteries.22
Radioactive tattoos of the outflow region further establish
that rotation occurs during OFT morphogenesis in the chick
embryo.23 Previous studies on human embryos suggested that
the OFT undergoes rotation during its remodeling.24 Com-
puterization of distances and angles between major anatom-
ical landmarks, in particular the axis of the semilunar valves,
showed that the junction of the OFT and the great arteries
undergoes a rapid rotation in a counterclockwise direction,
facing downstream, between Carnegie stages 15 and 19.24 In
addition, the angle of the aortic to pulmonary valve axis,
relative to the inferior surface of congenitally malformed
hearts, suggested that TOF, DORV, and TGA may result
from an arrested rotation of the outflow region at the base of
the great arteries.25,26
We now report a counterclockwise rotation of OFT myo-
cardium in the mouse embryo and examine this phenomenon
in mice with OFT defects. A transgenic line, y96-Myf5-nlacZ-
16,27 in which -galactosidase activity marks a part of OFT
myocardium, permits visualization of OFT rotation before,
and during, the septation of this region. Di-I tracing experi-
ments in cultured mouse embryos confirm this rotation.
Comparison of transgene expression in Splotch and Pitx2c
mutant embryos, which have conotruncal defects, suggests
that the abnormal position of the great arteries results from a
premature arrest or failure to initiate OFT rotation. These
results support the hypothesis that a spectrum of cardiac
anomalies with abnormally positioned great arteries may
arise from a perturbation of myocardial rotation, in addition
to abnormal OFT septation caused by neural crest cell
defects. These observations have implications for the under-
standing of conotruncal abnormalities in human congenital
heart defects.
Materials and Methods
Mice and Genotyping
The transgenic line y96-Myf5-nlacZ-16 (96-16) has been previously
described.27 The transgene consists of YAC DNA containing a
96-kb genomic fragment upstream of the mouse Myf5 gene
followed by an nlacZ reporter. Heterozygous 96-16 (C57BL/6) and
Splotch (Sp, C57BL/6, Jackson Laboratories) mice were interbred to
obtain Sp mutants carrying the transgene. The mutation interferes
with normal splicing of intron 3 and leads to at least 4 aberrantly
spliced mRNAs with exon 4 deleted.28 Sp mutant embryos were
identified by PCR using primers through exon 4: Sp1/exon4,
TTTCTGCTAAGAAGGCTGGAAGGAAATGCG; Sp2/exon 4,
TCCTCAGGATGCGGCTGATAGAACTCACACAC. The same
procedure of interbreeding was performed with the 96-16 and
Pitx2c (C57BL/6CBA, F1) mice. The Pitx2c neo allele has a
deletion of the majority of exon 4 including all coding sequences
within this exon.20 Pitx2c mutant embryos were identified by PCR
using primers for exon 3 and the neo sequence: 118/exon 3,
CTAATATCAGCTACCTGTCCCTGTCACTC; 119/exon 3, CTG-
GAAGTATCGGAGATTGTATGCACCTC; and 126/neo, CGAC-
GACCTGCAGC CAAGCTAGCT.
Analysis of Transgene Expression
Embryos were staged taking embryonic day (E) 0.5 as the morning
of the vaginal plug. Dissection, X-gal staining, and in situ hybrid-
ization using an nlacZ antisense probe were performed as described
previously.6 Embryos were examined using a Leica ZM20 stereomi-
croscope or Zeiss Axiophot microscope and photographed with a
digital camera (Axiocam-Zeiss).
Embryo Sections and Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry or counterstaining, sections were incu-
bated as described previously.6 The myosin heavy chain antibody,
MF20, was a monoclonal antibody from Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank, used at 1/200 dilution. The -galactosidase
antibody was a rabbit polyclonal provided by J. F. Nicolas (Pasteur
Institute, Paris, France) used at 1/500 dilution. The smooth muscle
actin (SMA) was a monoclonal antibody from Sigma, used at 1/400.
Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 or 546 and
goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 used at 1/200 dilution or 1/1000, respec-
tively (Molecular Probes). Sections were photographed using a Zeiss
Axiovert microscope with an Axiocam camera (AxioVision 4.4,
Zeiss).
Di-I Injection and Mouse Embryo Culture
Di-I labeling at E9.5 was initially performed levolaterally, through
the yolk sac, amnion, and pericardial wall, with injection into the
myocardium of the OFT, on the left, midway between the aortic sac
and the dextral bend in the heart tube, as previously described.6 Two
embryos were euthanized immediately to verify the injection site,
and the rest cultured for 24 hours. Of 25 live embryos, 8 showed
counterclockwise spread of the dye. In a second series of experi-
ments, the technique was refined to permit more precise localization
of smaller amounts of dye, by dissecting a “window” through the
yolk sac, opening the amnion and pericardium. This method can lead
to growth impairment. However, in 10 live embryos with labeled
cells, 3 showed counterclockwise relocation of the labeled cells. In
this series, 4 embryos were euthanized immediately to verify the
injection site.
Corrosion Cast and Scanning Electron Microscopy
Corrosion casts: E17.5 embryos were isolated and the heart exposed
by a thoracic incision. Batson’s number 17 acrylic (Polysciences)
was injected into right and left ventricles until the great arteries were
filled. After hardening overnight in distilled water at 4°C, tissues
were removed with Maceration Solution at 50°C for 24 hours
without a shaking. All samples were mounted on stubs and then
sputter-coated with gold. Samples were observed on a Zeiss SM940
scanning electron microscope.
Results
The y96-Myf5-nlacZ-16 Transgenic Line Provides a
Marker of Myocardium at the Base of the
Pulmonary Trunk
The transgenic mouse line y96-Myf5-nlacZ-16 (96-16), in
which an nlacZ reporter gene is under the control of 96 kb of
genomic DNA upstream of the myogenic regulatory gene
Myf5, expresses the transgene at sites of skeletal muscle
formation, as expected, but also shows ectopic expression in
the OFT of the heart attributable to an integration site effect
(Figure 1a). At E9.5, expression is observed in the dorsal (or
inferior) wall of the OFT and contiguous pharyngeal meso-
derm in the dorsal wall of the pericardial cavity (Figure 1a).
In the tubular OFT at E10.5, X-gal staining predominates in
myocardial cells of the dorsal wall (Figure 1b, 1b’, and 1c).
By E12.5 (Figure 1d), transgene expression is restricted to the
pulmonary trunk, to give a sharp boundary at the base of this
vessel at E15.5 (Figure 1e and 1e’). At all stages,
-galactosidase colocalizes with cardiac myosin heavy chain
(Figure 1c and data not shown), indicating expression in the
myocardium and not the adjacent smooth muscle of the vessel

(Figure 1f). Labeling continues to be detectable, although
weaker, at E18.5 (data not shown). -Galactosidase–positive
cells are not detected in the valves or septum (data not
shown). These observations suggest that the 96-16 transgenic
line provides a marker of myocardium at the base of the
pulmonary trunk, which can be followed during development
of the OFT region.

positive cells are located dorsally (Figure 2b and 2f) and then
in the left-hand and ventral part of the tubular OFT (Figure 2c
and 2g), before becoming largely confined to the base of the
pulmonary trunk (Figure 2d and 2h), as this separates from
the aorta during individualization of the great arteries from
the OFT. The expression pattern of the transgene is presented
schematically in Figure 2a’ through 2d’. These observations
suggest that the myocardial wall of the OFT rotates during
great artery development and that the 96-16 transgene marks
the myocardial component which will contribute to the base
of the pulmonary trunk throughout this process. To show that
this result does not reflect de novo transgene expression, we
analyzed nlacZ transcripts by in situ hybridization between
E9.5 and E12.5 (Figure 2i through 2l). nlacZ transcripts are
observed at E9.5 and E10.5 (Figure 2i and 2j) but are not
detectable subsequently (Figure 2k and 2l), whereas
-galactosidase activity is still present (Figure 2c, 2d, 2g, and
2h), reflecting the stability of the -galactosidase protein
compared with that of its mRNA. The changing position of
X-gal–labeled cells during great artery formation therefore
provides a “chase,” marking the cells that previously tran-
scribed the transgene. A direct demonstration of OFT rotation
comes from Di-I labeling experiments where dye was in-
jected into myocardial cells on the left-hand side of the OFT
at E9.5 either through the yolk sac (Figure 3a) or after
exteriorization (Figure 3c) (see Materials and Methods). After
24 hours of embryo culture, labeled cells are observed more
ventrally, showing that these cells have now changed position
(Figure 3b and 3d). This result was observed on 11 of 35 live
labeled embryos. Protein and transcript expression from the
transgene, together with Di-I labeling experiments, are all
consistent with a counterclockwise rotation of the OFT.
Defects in OFT Rotation in Splotch Embryos
To gain insight into the role of myocardial rotation in OFT
remodeling, we examined the expression of the 96-16 trans-
gene in mouse mutants in which this process is defective.
Splotch embryos develop defects in the OFT, including PTA
and DORV (Table and Figure 4). These conotruncal defects
result from failure of the cardiac neural crest to colonize the
developing heart in the absence of Pax3.14,16 In Splotch
mutant hearts with PTA at E14.5, the transgene is expressed
in the left-hand part of the myocardium at the base of the
single outflow vessel (Figure 4b and 4b’), whereas normally
at this stage -galactosidase activity is concentrated in a
ventral location at the base of the pulmonary trunk (Figure 4a
and a’). In Splotch mutant hearts with DORV at E15.5, a
rotation defect is again observed with -galactosidase–posi-
tive cells present in the left-hand side of the outflow region,
instead of ventrally (Figure 4d compared with 4c). At E11.5,
during OFT septation, the transgene is normally expressed on
the left side of the OFT (Figure 4e), whereas in the Splotch
mutant, -galactosidase activity is observed dorsally (Figure
4f, arrowhead), as in wild-type hearts at E10.5 (see Figure 2f).
These observations suggest that rotation of the myocardial
wall of the OFT is affected at early stages in hearts, giving
rise to DORV or PTA and is therefore associated with
abnormal positioning of the great arteries and failure of OFT
septation.
Defects of OFT Rotation in Pitx2c Embryos
All Pitx2c mutants have OFT anomalies with a majority
characterized by abnormal positioning of the great arteries
(93%), such as TGA or DORV, whereas 7% present PTA
(Table). At E12.5, the aorta is normally positioned dorsally
to the pulmonary trunk (Figure 5a), whereas in Pitx2c
mutants with DORV, the aorta is positioned ventrally
(Figure 5b). As in the case of Splotch mutants with PTA,
we observed 96-16 expression in the left-hand side of the
OFT in Pitx2c mutant hearts with the same defect (Figure
5c and 5d), reinforcing the notion that PTA is associated
with a rotation defect.
Among the types of malposition of the great arteries
observed in Pitx2c mutants, 70% of embryos have TGA
(Table and Figure 6b). Lateral views show that in these cases,
the pulmonary trunk is positioned dorsally to the aorta instead

of spiraling around it (Figure 6a and 6b). The pulmonary
trunk normally emerges from the right ventricle (Figure 6c),
whereas in Pitx2c mutant embryos with TGA, the pulmo-
nary trunk is connected to the left ventricle (Figure 6d). This
is referred to as ventriculo-arterial discordance. At E15.5,
transgene expression is normally detected at the base of the
pulmonary trunk, which lies ventral to the aorta (Figure 6e
and 6e’). In contrast, in TGA hearts, transgene expression is
maintained in myocardium at the base of the pulmonary
trunk, now positioned dorso-laterally (Figure 6f and 6f’), also
indicative of a rotation defect.
Discussion
Analysis of the expression profile of reporter protein com-
pared with transcript from the y96-Myf5-nlacZ-16 (96-16)
transgene, specifically expressed in myocardium at the base
of the pulmonary trunk, suggested that the OFT rotates during
development of the great arteries. Rotation of the myocardial
wall of the OFT was demonstrated by Di-I injection experi-
ments in cultured mouse embryos. Observations of 96-16
transgene expression in Splotch mice with PTA or DORV
reveal an arrest of OFT rotation associated with a septation
defect. This is also observed in Pitx2c mutant hearts which
have similar malformations. In addition, we show that
Pitx2c mutants displaying TGA have a failure of OFT
rotation. Thus, the expression profile of the 96-16 transgene
in Splotch and Pitx2c mutants demonstrates that rotation of
the myocardial wall of the OFT is disturbed in conotruncal
defects such as PTA, DORV, and TGA, suggesting a crucial
role for myocardial rotation in positioning of the great
arteries.
At early stages of OFT development, expression of the
96-16 transgene colocalizes with myocardial markers, and
-galactosidase continues to be present at the base of the

pulmonary trunk at late fetal stages, after nlacZ transcripts
have ceased to be detectable. No -galactosidase–positive
cells are detected in the smooth muscle of the pulmonary
trunk. This, together with the sharp boundary of transgene
expression at the base of this vessel, is consistent with a
retraction of the myocardium23 as the smooth muscle tunic
develops.8 Further support for rotation of OFT myocardium
in the mouse comes from a clonal analysis,29 which showed
oriented cell growth of myocardial cells in different compart-
ments of the heart. A spiraling orientation of clones was
observed in the OFT at E10.5, compatible with rotation of the
myocardium.30 Labeling of cells in the right-hand side of the
pharyngeal mesoderm, which will contribute to OFT myocar-
dium, in the chick embryo resulted in labeled cells on the left
side of the OFT, again consistent with rotation.8 Earlier
studies on human embryos, based on measurement of dis-
tances and angles between major anatomical landmarks, had
shown that the junction of the OFT and great arteries
undergoes a rotational movement between Carnegie stages 15
and 19.24 Moreover, measurements on embryos with
conotruncal defects suggested that this rotation is prematurely
arrested at different developmental stages according to the
type of malformation.25,26 Our study provides the first direct
evidence for such counterclockwise rotation of the OFT in
mammalian embryos. The rotation of OFT myocardium in the
mouse embryo, as visualized with the 96-16 transgene, begins
at E9.5, equivalent to Carnegie stage 11, whereas rotation has
been documented from Carnegie stage 15 in humans. This
may reflect the sensitivity of transgene detection compared
with physical measurements. Most of the myocardium has
been added to the mouse OFT by E9.5, suggesting that the
OFT first elongates and then rotates.
Rotation of the myocardial wall of the OFT is integrated
into the remodeling process of the outflow region, which is
intimately linked to the influx of neural crest. Splotch mutant
mice develop OFT defects, including PTA and DORV,15,31 as
a result of reduced colonization of the OFT by cardiac neural
crest cells.14,16 Our study demonstrates that rotation of the
OFT myocardial wall is prematurely arrested in Splotch
embryos. This precedes OFT septation, a process dependent
on neural crest cells that guide the organization of the
endocardial cushions.11 Because we have never detected Pax3
expression in OFT myocardium, including in Pax3nlacZ/ mice
in which the heart is -galactosidase negative,32 the reduction
of cardiac neural crest in Splotch mutant embryos may
indirectly influence the process of OFT rotation. Moreover,
rotation is observed from E9.5, when neural crest cells first
invade this region.14,33 The rotation defect supports the
conclusion that OFT development requires extensive cross-
talk between neural crest and myocardial cells.17,34 However,
this is not the only factor that leads to defective OFT rotation
associated with PTA, because it is also seen in the 7% of
hearts with this malformation in Pitx2c mutants where
cardiac neural crest migration appears to occur normally.20
These findings show that abnormal septation, secondary to a
neural crest cell defect,9 is not the only cause of PTA, which
we show is associated with a rotation defect.
Ablation of cardiac neural crest in the chick embryo
induces a large spectrum of malformations affecting the OFT
region but not TGA.13 This malformation probably has
multiple causes, as evidenced by the Perlecan mouse, which
has an extracellular matrix defect,35 or by retinoic acid
treatments, which induce endocardial cushion defects.36 As
seen here for Pitx2c, mutations in genes that affect left–right
asymmetry, such as cryptic or type IIB activin receptor can
also lead to TGA.19,37,38 Our observations on Pitx2c mutant
embryos suggest that this malformation can be induced by a
laterality defect affecting rotation of the myocardial wall of
the OFT. This may result from an earlier effect on OFT
myocardial precursors in the anterior heart field,3 where cells
express Pitx2c and are perturbed in its absence.20 Left–right
signaling may also exert its effect via the myocardium itself,
because misexpression of Pitx2 in the embryonic heart

correlates with abnormal OFT development.39 Whatever the
underlying cause, our results suggest that arrested rotation of
OFT myocardium is related to TGA in the absence of
Pitx2c. The fact that this phenomenon is also associated with
PTA and DORV probably reflects underlying complexity in
the cell populations and stages affected in the Pitx2c mutant,
leading to a spectrum of abnormalities during OFT
remodeling.
Rotation of the myocardium at the base of the OFT is
probably essential to achieve normal positioning of the great
arteries with respect to each other at the ventriculo-arterial
junction. Indeed, the spiraling movement of the aortico-pul-
monary septum, which generates specific ventriculo-arterial
connections, may result from the rotation of the myocardial
wall of the OFT (Figure 7). Understanding the molecular and
genetic regulation of OFT rotation, as visualized here for the
first time in the mouse, should provide important new insights
into congenital heart defects affecting ventricular septation
and great artery development.
