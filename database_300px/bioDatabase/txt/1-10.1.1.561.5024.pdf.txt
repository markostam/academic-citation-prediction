Optimizing Counter-Terror Operations:
Should One Fight Fire with “Fire” or “Water”?
Jonathan P. Caulkins∗ Dieter Grass† Gustav Feichtinger†
and Gernot Tragler†
Abstract
This paper deals dynamically with the question of how recruitment
to terror organizations is influenced by counter-terror operations. This is
done within a optimal control model, where the key state is the (relative)
number of terrorists and the key controls are two types of counter-terror
tactics, one (“water”) that does not one (“fire”) that does provoke re-
cruitment of new terrorists. The model is nonlinear and does not admit
analytical solutions, but an efficient numerical implementation of Pontrya-
gin’s Minimum Principle allows for solution with base case parameters and
considerable sensitivity analysis. Generally this model yields two different
steady states, one where the terror-organization is nearly eradicated and
one with a high number of terrorists. Whereas water strategies are used at
almost any time, it can be optimal not to use fire strategies if the number
of terrorists is below a certain threshold.
1 Introduction
One concern expressed about aggressive counter-terror operations is that they
might turn public opinion against the counter-terror forces, thereby helping
terrorist organizations recruit new personnel. For example, Heymann (2003)
notes that “recruitment to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) increased sharply
during some periods of overly vigorous British action against suspects”. Likewise
Kaplan et al. (2005) develop an empirical model that finds that Israeli “killings
of terror suspects by Israel sparks estimated recruitment to the terror stock that
increases rather than decreases the rate of suicide bombings.”
It does not seem credible that the best counter-terror strategy is to do noth-
ing proactive. On the other hand, it also does not seem prudent to ignore entirely
the possibility that offensive counter-terror operations might be a double-edged

sword, stimulating new recruitment even as they kill current terrorists. Presum-
ably there may be some optimal intensity of counter-terror efforts that balances
their obvious benefits with potential negative effects on recruitment and/or some
optimal mix of tactics that are more or less prone to stimulate new recruitment.
This paper introduces a stylized optimal dynamic control model that frames
this trade-off in mathematical notation and explores the implications of the
model solutions. The work is clearly exploratory inasmuch as functional forms
and parameters are not derived from empirical data, but the mathematical
framing lends precision to underlying concepts that may clarify some associated
issues.
2 Model
There are a wide range of counter-terror tactics that might be arrayed along a
continuum in terms of their likelihood of stimulating recruitment, but the model
abstracts these into two discrete categories. “Fire” strategies anger potential
recruits to terrorist organizations enough to make it easier for the terrorists to
recruit more personnel. They might include killing terrorists via aerial bombing
of residential neighborhoods, aggressively searching all people passing through
a checkpoint or road block, or other tactics that involve significant collateral
damage or inconvenience to innocent third parties.
“Water” strategies “play by the rules” in the eyes of the general population.
They are intelligence-driven arrests or “surgical” operations against individuals
who are known with very high confidence to be guilty and which do not harm
innocent parties. The presumption is that water strategies are more costly
and/or are inherently limited, e. g., by lack of “actionable targeting intelligence”.
The extent to which the decision maker employs fire and water strategies
will be denoted by the (control) variables v(t) and u(t), respectively. Since in
dynamic optimization all variables are functions of time, we follow the custom
of omitting explicit mention of the time argument in the sequel, and so refer to
the fire and water controls as simply v and u.
The strength of the terrorist organizations is reflected in the (single) state
variable, x. That variable might most simply be thought of as the number
of active terrorists, but more generally could reflect the organization’s total
resources including financial capital, weapons, technological know-how, etc., as
in Keohane and Zeckhauser (2003).
The size and strength of the terrorist organization evolves over time in re-
sponse to various inflows and outflows. Keohane and Zeckhauser (2003) and
Kaplan et al. (2005) model baseline recruitment as a constant. We likewise
include such a constant recruitment term, τ . However, we presume that τ is
small, accounting for a minority of new recruits. It is common in modeling of
drug and criminal enterprises to treat recruitment (initiation) as an increasing
function of the current state Caulkins (2005), and other authors (e.g., Castillo-
Chavez & Song, 2003) have applied this reasoning to recruitment of terrorists.
The more terrorists there are, the more new terrorists the organization can re-
2
cruit per unit time because recruiting occurs through personal interaction, as
in diffusion models of word-of-mouth advertising. Organizational growth is not
exponential and unbounded because there are other limiting factors that can re-
duce per capita recruitment as organizational size increases. On the other hand,
a central premise of this paper is that aggressive use of fire strategies (denoted
v) increases recruitment. So this second inflow can be denoted by I(x, v), where
Ix > 0, Ixx < 0 and Iv > 0. We do not assume that terrorism can be blamed
entirely on, let along justified by, over-aggressive counter-terror operations, so
I(0, x) > 0. In other words, recruitment of new terrorists occurs even when no
“fire” tactics are employed.
We distinguish three outflows from the stock of terrorists. The first repre-
sents the rate at which people leave the organization, die in suicide attacks, or
fall victim to routine or background enforcement efforts that are in addition to
those the decision maker in this problem is actively managing. This flow is a
function only of x and is represented by O1(x), with O1x > 0. The second out-
flow reflects the consequences of water operations and so is given by O2(u, x).
The final is outflow is due to fire operations and is denoted by O3(v, x).
Over the (potentially infinite) planning horizon, the decision maker seeks to
minimize the sum of both some function of x plus the amount spent on both
fire (v) and water (u) counter-terror operations. It is standard to presume that
outcomes are discounted at some constant rate r per unit time, so the full model
can be written:
min
u,v≥0
∫ ∞
0
e−rt (C1(x) + C (u, v)) dt
s.t. x˙ = τ + I(v, x)−O1(x)−O2(u, x)−O3(v, x)
x(0) = x0
Relatively little of interest can be derived without specifying functional forms
for the costs (C1(x), C(u, v), Outflow rates (O1(x), O2(u, x) O3(v, x)), and ini-
tiation function (I(v, x)). We know of no data or literature that would support
any specific functional forms, so we opt for simple and transparent approach of
adopting very simple forms and focus on qualitative behavior of the solutions.
Again, the goal is to lend precision to a set of concepts, not to compute specific,
quantitative policy prescriptions.
The costs of terrorism are assumed to be linear in the number of terrorists.
That is C1(x) = cx. Kaplan et al. (2005) model the log of the number of terror
attacks as being linear in the stock of terrorists, which would suggest a cost
term that is exponential in x. We also analyzed that case and obtained results
that are qualitatively similar, but make the linear form our base model for three
reasons. The linear form makes intuitive sense, it is easier to analyze, and, most
importantly, its simplicity makes clear that the interesting threshold results
obtained below stem from the systems dynamics, not the choice of functional
form in the objective.
Turning to the control costs, one could imagine that there might be some
3
adverse interaction such that Cuv > 0. For example, using fire tactics could
make it more difficult (expensive) to use water tactics. We will see below that
even without such interactions, the optimal solution does not always use pos-
itive levels of both controls. To avoid the appearance that when fire tactics
are eschewed it stems from such a cost interaction, we model the control cost
function as being separable, C(u, v) = C2(u) + C3(v). Exploring interactions
might, however, be a fruitful area for further research.
Specifically, the costs of employing the water and fire strategies are presumed
to be concave for the usual diminishing returns arguments and so are modeled
as being quadratic. That is C2(u) = u2 and C3(v) = v2.
Following the tradition of drug and crime models, recruitment is modeled
by a power function in x. Counter-terror operations are assumed to accelerate
recruitment by a percentage that is proportional to the intensity of the fire
operations, with proportionality constant ρ. Hence, function I(v, x) is taken
to be (1 + ρv)kxα. Note: eliminating fire operations reduces “word of mouth”
recruitment to I(v, x) = kxα, but it does not eliminate such recruitment.
The “natural” outflow O1(x) is presumed to occur at a constant per capita
rate O1(x) = µx. The outflows O2(x, u), O3(x, v) stemming from counter-terror
operations are modeled as products of the controls and the number of terrorists.
That is O2(x, u) = β(u)f1(x) and O3(x, v) = ν(v)f2(x). The outflow due to
fire strategies O2(x, v) is modeled as being linear in x, because the methods
are perceived to be “shotgun” or “undirected” methods and hence f2(x) = x.
The more targets there are (i.e., the larger x is), the more terrorists will be
hit. In contrast, the outflow due to water strategies is presumed to be concave
in x because actionable intelligence is limited and heterogeneous. There may
also be diminishing returns if more specialized skills are needed, so there are a
limited number of units that can conduct water operations. In particular, this
is modeled by a power function so f1(x) = xθ.
Finally the functional forms of β(u) and ν(v) have to be specified. They
should be concave, and we use the same functional form for both so that any
differences in the way the optimal solution employs fire and water strategies
stem from their differences in character, not from rather arbitrary decisions
concerning functional forms. It turns out that a logarithmic function is conve-
nient for the analysis. The one difference between the water and fire functions
is that water operations are more expensive, so for any given level of spending
z, β(z) < ν(z). We accommodate that difference simply by pre-multiplying the
water function by a constant β that is smaller than the corresponding constant
(ν) for fire operations. These two constants reflect the “efficiency” of the two
types of operations and below we conduct considerable sensitivity analysis with
respect to both constants.
In sum, the model we wish to investigate can be written as

and x(0) = x0.

3 Analysis
3.1 Optimality Conditions
The Fire or Water (FOW) model can be solved by applying Pontryagin’s min-
imum principle (see, e.g., Feichtinger & Hartl, 1986; Leonard & Long, 1992).
Therefore we consider the current value Hamiltonian H
H = λ0
(
cx+ u2 + v2
)
+λ
(
τ + (1 + ρv) kxα − µx− β ln(1 + u)xθ − ν ln(1 + v)x) ,
(1)
where λ0 ∈ R and λ denotes the costate variable in current value terms.
First we have to exclude the degenerate case λ0 = 0. To do so we first
assume λ0 = 0 and then derive a contradiction. If λ0 = 0 we find
Hu = − βx
θ
1 + u
< 0.
Hence H will reach its minimum only for u =∞, which is not a feasible solution.
So λ0 > 0 and can without loss of generality be normalized to 1 and hence
omitted in the following.
Applying the standard methods of optimal control theory we derive the
necessary optimality condition
u∗ = argmin
u≥0
H,
For an inner minimum Hu = 0 has to hold, which implies
Hu = 2u− λβx
θ
1 + u
,
and hence we get
u∗ =
1
2
(√
1 + 2λβxθ − 1
)
. (2)
Since
v∗ = argmin
v≥0
H,
we have to solve Hv = 0 for an inner minimum v∗ with
Hv = 2v + λ
(
ρkxα − νx
1 + v
)
,
5
which yields
v∗ =
1
4
(
−ρkxα − 2 +
√
(λρkxα − 2)2 + 8λνx
)
. (3)
As the derivative of H with respect to the state x equals
Hx = c+ λ
(
k (1 + ρv∗)αxα−1 − µ− β ln (1 + u∗)− ν ln (1 + v∗)) (4)
the canonical dynamical system with inactive control constraint (SIC) can be
written as
x˙ = τ + (1 + ρv∗) kxα − µx− β ln (1 + u∗)xθ − ν ln (1 + v∗)x (5)
λ˙ = λ
(
r − k (1 + ρv∗)αxα−1 + µ+ β ln (1 + u∗) + ν ln (1 + v∗))− c, (6)
where u∗ and v∗ are given by Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 respectively.
The state x denotes the number of terrorists and the costate λ is its shadow-
price, meaning the increase in the objective function due to an infinitesimal
increase in x. That both quantities are always positive can be derived from
Eqs. 5-6. According to Eq. 5, x˙ = τ > 0, whenever x = 0. Hence x remains
positive for every initial state x0 > 0. A similar argument ensures the positivity
of λ. It can be seen from Eq. 6 that λ˙ = −c < 0 if λ = 0. Hence if there exists a
t0 with λ(t0) ≤ 0, then λ(t) would remain negative thereafter. But in the long
run limt→∞ λ(t) > 0, so there must not exist such a t0. I.e., λ(t) is positive for
every t.
What remains to be shown is the minimum property of Eqs. 2-3. But as the
Hesse matrix of H in respect to u and v is of the form
Positivity of x and λ leads to three further results. First, from Eq. 2 it
follows that u∗ is positive since 1 + 2λβxθ > 1 holds for x, λ > 0. Second,
λ > 0 implies that increasing the stock of terrorists is always bad, so one would
never invest in a control strategy that stimulates recruitment of more terrorists
than it eliminates, regardless of the intervention’s cost, so long as costs are not
negative. Third, the Hessian matrix of H with respect to u and v
D2H =
[
2 + λβx
θ
(1+u)2
0
0 2 + λνx
(1+v)2
]
, (7)
is positive definite as long as x and λ are positive, so it satisfies the Legendre-
Clebsh condition, which is a sufficient minimum condition for the controls. How-
ever, the Hamiltonian H is not concave with respect to x, so the common suffi-
cient condition for the existence of an optimal solution does not hold. Therefore
from a rigorous mathematical point of view, every solution calculated to be op-
timal below can only be denoted as a candidate (xˆ, λˆ) for an optimal solution
with the possible optimal controls (uˆ, vˆ).
Nevertheless we can calculate the total costs
J(xˆ, uˆ, vˆ) =
∫ ∞
0
e−rt
(
cxˆ+ uˆ2 + vˆ2
)
dt

for each of these candidates numerically. If multiple candidates exist the costs
are compared to find the minimum. See e. g. Fig. 1 where this is displayed for
the base case (defined in Sec. 3.3). The detailed analysis of the base case can
be found in Sec. 4.1.

Nishimura-Skiba (DNS) point.
The water control u has been shown to be positive, but positivity cannot
be demonstrated for the fire control v, so we have to include explicitly a non-
negativity constraint on v. This means that the Lagrangian
L = H + lv (8)
has to be considered. The necessary optimality conditions under this control
constraint can be stated as (see, e.g., Feichtinger & Hartl, 1986; Leonard &
Long, 1992):
Lv = 0,
which implies an explicit formula for the Lagrange multiplier
l = −Hv. (9)
Furthermore the following non-positive and slackness conditions have to hold
l ≤ 0, lv = 0.
Using Eqs. 5-6 the dynamical system with active control constraint (SAC), that
is v∗ = 0, is given by
x˙ = τ + kxα − µx− β ln (1 + u∗)xθ (10)
λ˙ = λ
(
r − kαxα−1 − µ− β ln (1 + u∗))− c. (11)

3.2 Steady States
Due to the nonlinearity of the system dynamics (Eqs. 5-6 and Eqs. 10-11) the
steady states can only be calculated numerically. All the calculations are done
within the MATLABr environment, using especially the MATCONT toolbox
(see Doedel, Govaerts, and Kuznetsov (2003)). To distinguish between steady
states when the control constraint is inactive (SIC) as opposed to active (SAC),
a superscript i is used for SIC and superscript a is used for SAC. Likewise we
distinguish between steady states with a high and low number of terrorists (x)
by the subscripts l for low and h for high. Unstable nodes and foci are denoted
by the subscript u. Furthermore the subscript s denotes a switching point,
where the control constraint becomes active.
3.3 Base Case Parameters
For the discount rate we use a typical value of r = 0.05. The outflow rate µ
is assumed to be 5%, which is a typical rate assumed for high-rate criminal
offenders (e.g., Greenwood et al. (1994)). That is substantially higher than
the natural, peacetime mortality rate for young adults due to arrest, death by
suicide attack, etc., but reflects a presumption that in the absence of active
counter-terror measures terrorist organizations do not suffer high attrition.
For reasons discussed above, we assume that the constant inflow rate term
τ is small. The specific value matters little and we pick a value of τ = 10−5.
Having τ be positive, not zero, is a mathematical convenience; it creates a single
well-defined low level equilibrium instead of having the entire vertical axis (x =
0) in the state-costate space be a steady state. Increasing or decreasing τ by a
factor of 10 or even 100 has minimal effect on the analysis.
Parameter k is chosen such that the high steady state xih is normalized to 1 in
the absence of counter-terror operations (and assuming that τ = 0 is negligible).
That is, x will be measured as a percentage of steady-state size of the terrorist
organization when its opponents do not mount counter-terror operations. Since
the uncontrolled dynamic is given by
x˙ = kxα − µx
the high steady state xih = α−1
√
µ
k , so normalizing x implies that k = µ = 0.05.
In principle the exponent α in the initiation term could take on any value
between 0 and 1, but we prefer larger values (emphasizing the potential for
existing terrorists to recruit new terrorists). In the absence of relevant empirical
data, we choose a basecase value of α = 0.75, but explore the influence of this
parameter over its entire range in Sec. 5.2.
The efficiency parameters β and ν cannot be derived directly from eval-
uations of actual interventions. Instead, we choose values for them and the
associated parameter θ such that the fire and water interventions reflect the
spirit of the concepts we are trying to investigate. In particular, we imagine
that the following statements are true. (1) When terrorist organizations have
grown to their maximum size (normalized here to x = 1) fire strategies are
8
substantially (specifically ten times) more powerful than are water strategies,
so ν/β = 10. (2) A significant investment in terror-control operations (on the
order of $10B per year) can kill or otherwise remove a number of terrorists each
year that is equal to 10% of the organization’s maximum size. Hence, ν and β
should be on the order of 0.1/ ln(1 +
√
10)1. (3) When terrorist organizations
are small, water strategies are relatively more effective, but the breakeven point
where fire and water strategies are equally cost-effective is much less than half
the maximum organizational size. Hence, we choose θ such that
ν/βx1−θ = 1 (12)
for a fairly small x, specifically θ = 0.1, for which equality holds when x ≈ 1/13.
Given that θ = 0.1, choosing β = 0.01 and ν = 0.1 meet our other criteria.
The parameter ρ measures the influence of fire interventions on Recruitment.
It is set to 1 in the base case since when fire tactics are employed in the optimal
solution, v is usually in the vicinity of 0.2 or 0.3. This means that those counter-
terror operations stimulate a 20% to 30% increase in recruitment. That is large
enough to make the chief dynamic investigated here meaningful, without being
so large as to “rig” the results against using fire tactics. As a point of com-
parison, Kaplan et al. (2005) empirically-calibrated hit-dependent recruitment
model suggests that hits could have accounted for nearly all of the increases in
the stock of terrorists confronting Israel. The impact on the optimal solution of
changing ρ will be analyzed in Sec. 4.4.
The costs c per terrorist is assumed to be 1 in the base case, and the con-
sequences for the optimal strategies on changing these costs are analyzed in
Sec. 5.1. With that value and the observed intensities of counter-terror oper-
ations we get costs of terror and terror-control that are of sensible orders of
magnitude relative to each other. In the low-level equilibrium when terrorists
have been nearly annihilated counter-terror operations generate more costs than
do terror attacks themselves, but at the high-level equilibrium the opposite is
true and terror attacks generate societal costs that are roughly twenty times the
amount invested in (offensive) counter-terror operations.

Afghanistan was 3,000 - 4,000 fighters, and a guess that US operations eliminate about 300-
400 Al-Qaeda personnel per year.

4 Optimal Strategies
4.1 Base case
Numerical calculations reveal there is one high-level optimal steady state xih ≈
0.62 and one low-level optimal steady state xal ≈ 8×10−7. The high steady state
xih is derived from the SIC version of the model, so fire strategies are employed
v > 0. The low steady state xal is derived from the SAC version in which the
control constraint is active (v = 0) so only water control is used to keep the
number of terrorists at the low steady state.
Calculating optimal paths leading to the high and low steady states reveals
two facts. First there exists a switching point xs ≈ 0.06 to the left of which
it is suboptimal to use fire interventions. Further to the left there is a second
state (at xD ≈ 0.013) from which there exist two strategies that are optimal
inasmuch as both yield the same over-all objective function value. This state is a
so called Dechert, Nishimura, Skiba or DNS point referring to Skiba (1978) and
Dechert and Nishimura (1983), where the decision maker is indifferent about
which strategy to chose. Moving to the left from xD by employing a high level
of water control uD ≈ 0.29 leads to the low steady state and virtual extinction
of the terrorist organization (see Fig. 2d). Starting from the same initial point
but using only a moderate level of water control allows the stock of terrorists to
grow, eventually leading in the long run to the high steady state (see Fig. 2b).
It might seem odd that if it may not be optimal to all but eradicate a terrorist
organization when it is possible to do so. However, if the terrorist organization is
already large when control begins, eradication can take enormous effort. While
it is true that eradication would lead to fewer terrorists and, hence, fewer terror-
related losses, at some point those gains can be offset by the increased cost of
counter-terror efforts. The DNS point is exactly that point where the gains of
eradication are offset by the additional control costs.
If control begins to the left of the DNS point, before the terrorist organization
has grown too large, then it is optimal to take actions (specifically water control)
to nearly eradicate the terrorists. If the initial number of terrorists exceeds this
state xD, it is still optimal to conduct counter-terror operations, but only to
slow not ultimately to prevent growth of the terrorist organization to xih. When
the terror organizations are only modestly larger than xD, only water controls
are used, but once x grows beyond xs fire strategies are also used. Indeed,
eventually fire is used more extensively than water since the θ exponent makes
fire control more efficient when the number of terrorists is large.
The next few subsections explore the sensitivity of this optimal strategy
to three of the most important parameters: the efficiency of fire interventions
ν, the efficiency of water interventions β, and the extent to which using fire
strategies stimulates greater recruitment of terrorists ρ. The general structure
of this solution turns out to be fairly robust. The details depend on the various
parameter values, of course, but in quite sensible and predictable ways.

Figure 3: The optimal strategies for large efficiency values ν. Panel a) shows that with
ν = 0.2 the DNS point xD is to the right of the switching point xs. Panel b) shows there is a
unique, optimal (low level) long run steady state xal for ν = 1.2.
4.2 Optimal strategy for increasing fire efficiency ν
In the base case, fire control was not used at the DNS point or any other
x < xs ≈ 0.06, so those results would not be affected at all if fire control
were less effective (smaller ν). However, reducing ν shifts to the right both
the switching point xs (where fire is first used) and the high-level equilibrium;
when fire is weak, the range of circumstances for which fire is appropriate and
the maximum number of terrorists that it is optimal to eradicate both shrink.
If ν is small enough (roughly around ν = 0.05), the switching point moves to
the right of the long-run equilibrium, implying that fire control should never be
used, unless for some reason the terrorist organization were initially larger than
its maximum peacetime size.
The solution can change more substantially if fire interventions become more
effective than in the base case ν > 0.1. Increasing ν naturally shifts to the left
both the high steady state and the switching point xs. When ν is increased to
approximately 0.16, the switching point moves to the left of the DNS threshold,
so it is optimal to use fire as well as water when starting at that critical point
from which it is optimal either to eradicate or to accommodate terrorists in the
long run. (With more effective fire control, one does not have to accommodate
to as many terrorists, since the high-level equilibrium shifts significantly to the
left.) This is displayed for ν = 0.2 by Fig. 3a).
If ν is increased much more, to be about twelve times the base case value,
the optimal strategy does change dramatically. The high steady state of the
SIC is no longer an optimal solution (see Fig. 3b); fire control together with
water control are now sufficiently efficient that it is always optimal to drive the
number of terrorists down to the low steady state xal . In such circumstances,
it would be optimal to use more fire than water initially, but once the stock of
terrorists has been sufficiently reduced, water is used more than fire in the end
game.

Figure 4: The optimal strategies for increasing β are depicted. Sub-figure a) shows the
“extreme” case β = 0 where a high number of terrorists is optimal in the long run. Contrary
to that sub-figure b) represents the case of a high water efficiency with β = 0.03, where nearly
annihilating the terrorists is optimal in the long run.
4.3 Optimal strategy for increasing water efficiency β
Next consider the effects of varying the efficiency of water control β. In the
extreme, if water control has no effect β = 0 then it is of course not optimal to
use water interventions. This means the high steady state xih ≈ 0.65 is always
optimal, as can be derived from Eq. 2 and seen in Fig. 4a). There is still a
switching point xs ≈ 0.06 above which fire control is used, but it only slows not
prevents growth toward the high level equilibrium xih.
Water control’s efficiency does not need to be very much above zero (specif-
ically β > 3.5 × 10−4) in order for the low steady state to emerge as optimal
provided that the initial number of terrorists is small enough. (I.e., for the
solution to be structurally the same optimal strategy as described for the base
case.) For example if β is β = 0.001 the low and high optimal long run steady
states are xal ≈ 1.1×10−6 and xih ≈ 0.65, respectively. The switching point will
be close to its base value xs ≈ 0.06, but the DNS point is very small if β is small
xD = 5 × 10−4 because with low water efficiency, it would be quite expensive
to all but eradicate terrorists unless there were initially very few of them.
Increasing β shifts the DNS point to the right and the high-level steady
state to the left. Increasing β beyond about double its base case value β ≈ 0.02
moves the DNS point to the right of the switching point, which remains constant
at xs ≈ 0.06. Finally if β is more than three times higher than in the base
case, water becomes so efficient that the DNS point disappears and the low-
level steady state (effectively annihilating the terrorists) becomes the globally
optimal strategy (see Fig. 4b).

Figure 5: The optimal strategies for no influence of the fire interventions on recruitment a)
ρ = 0 and doubled influence b) ρ = 2 are depicted.
4.4 Optimal strategy for varying influence of fire inter-
ventions ρ on recruitment
If there were no backlash from fire interventions on recruitment ρ = 0, then
common sense suggests and Eq. 3 confirms it is always optimal to use fire in-
terventions. As can be seen in Fig. 5a), there would still be two optimal long
run states: a low steady state with xil ≈ 8× 10−7 and a high steady state with
xih ≈ 0.28. Furthermore, the two steady states are still separated by a DNS point
xD ≈ 0.012. So the main changes are that fire control is always used and the
high level steady state has less than half as many terrorists as in the base case.
Introducing backlash by increasing ρ from zero naturally reduces the amount
of fire control used, so the high long-run number of terrorists increases. The
DNS point does as well, but much less dramatically. While increasing ρ from
zero to one leads to a 120% increase in the high long-run number of terrorists,
(compare Fig. 5a) and Fig. 2a)), the DNS point only increases by 6%.
If ρ increases to above about 0.06 (6% of the base case value of 1.0), fire
control is no longer used near the low-level steady state. In other words, if there
is even a modest backlash effect, then fire strategies should be curtailed before
the terrorists have been fully subdued. If the backlash parameter ρ is bigger
than about 2 (double its base case value), the switching point moves to the right
of even the high optimal steady state, and fire controls are essentially always
counterproductive (see Fig. 5b).
5 Optimal Strategies for other parameters
5.1 Optimal strategy for different costs c
In the base case it is assumed that c = 1. This assumption is more or less
arbitrarily we next consider the influence of the costs c on the optimal strategy.
14
Increasing c by a factor of five does not alter the structure of the solution. The
low level base case and switching point are essentially unaffected. The DNS
point is about four times larger xD ≈ 0.05, and the high level steady state is
about two thirds as large xih ≈ 0.4. (See Fig. 6a). That makes sense. If ter-
rorists are more costly, one is willing to work harder to eradicate them even
if there initial numbers are a bit larger, and even if it is optimal to accommo-
date an ongoing terrorism presence, the level tolerated is reduced. To achieve
these changes, effort expended on both fire and control strategies is more than
doubled. (Compare Fig. 2c and Fig. 6a).
If the costs are increased above c ≈ 13.7 it is no longer ever optimal to let the
long run number of terrorists be high. Instead, it is always optimal to approach
the low steady state. The switching point remains at xs ≈ 0.06, but as could be
expected, the intensity of fire and particularly water controls increases further
as compared to the base case.
5.2 Optimal strategy for different α
Parameter α models the extent to which terrorism recruitment is “contagious”
in the sense of recruitment being an increasing function of the current number
of terrorists. With smaller levels of α, the inflow of new terrorists is closer
to a constant and can be large even when the stock of existing terrorists is
relatively small. With large levels of α, recruitment grows more nearly linearly
in the current number of terrorists and so can get quite small as the number of
terrorists is driven down.
Not surprisingly then, if α is small enough, it is never optimal to drive
terrorism down to the low level steady state because recruitment would remain
high and, hence, so would the ongoing level of terror control effort needed to
preserve that low-level steady state. As numerical calculations reveal the low
level steady state becomes a relevant optimal solution not until α > 0.3.
On the other hand, if α is large enough, it is relatively easy to keep terrorism
from springing back once it is eradicated, so it is always optimal to eradicate
terrorism, not matter what the starting number of terrorists is. What is perhaps
somewhat more surprising is that it can be optimal (e.g., for α = 1 to use both
fire and water control at all times; there is no switching point.
5.3 Optimal strategy for different θ
Parameter θ models the interaction between the current number of terrorists
and the effectiveness of water interventions. As is explained in Sec. 3.3, θ, β and
ν are intimately connected via Eq. 12. Keeping ν and the calculated x = 1/13
for the base case fixed, we vary θ and β simultaneously under assumption of
Eq. 12.
The solution is not affected much at all by reductions in the values of θ and
β. Even for θ = 0 and hence β ≈ 0.0077 the primary difference is just that the
DNS point shifts right to xD ≈ 0.02. That makes sense. The small θ means

β = 0.1 are depicted.
difficulties locating targets when there are very few terrorists are minor, and
that expands the range of initial values for which one should eradicate terror.
On the other hand, increasing θ and hence β reduces the ability to find
targets, making it less likely that eradication is optimal. Indeed, if θ is more
than about 0.42 it is never optimal to eradicate the terrorists. Fig. 6b) illustrates
that for the extreme case of θ = 1, the only long run optimal number of terrorists
is xih ≈ 0.29.
6 Conclusions
A number of authors have raised the possibility that counter-terror operations
might stimulate the flow of newly recruited terrorists at the same time that
they are removing some of the existing terrorists. Not all counter-terror tactics
are equally likely to provoke increased recruitment, so we introduce a simple
stylized model with two types of counter-terror operations: fire tactics that
stimulate increased recruitment and water tactics that do not. Water tactics are
intrinsically more limited in their ability to eliminate large numbers of terrorists,
e. g., because they depend on specific intelligence to target strikes in ways that
generate minimal collateral damage.
The basic structure of the model solution is quite robust with respect to
parameter values, which is helpful since estimating parameter values is very
difficult. Generally there are two different steady states. One has very few
terrorists and, hence, little recruitment of new terrorists. The other has many
more terrorists, sometimes approaching the steady state number when there
are no counter-terror operations. We found three possible policy prescriptions,
depending on the parameter values: (1) always drive the number of terrorists
down to the low-level steady state, (2) always allow the number of terrorists to
approach the high-level steady state, albeit using controls to slow the growth,
or (3) drive down the number of terrorists if they are not too numerous initially,
16
but otherwise allow them to grow to the higher level equilibrium.
The third case pertains with our base case parameters, and the state value
dividing the regions for which it is optimal to approach the low- and high-level
equilibria is a so-called DNS (Dechert, Nishimura, Skiba) point.
In terms of tactics, it is essentially always optimal to use the targeted (water)
tactics, but fire tactics should only be employed if the number of terrorists is
above a critical “switching point”. Hence, for many parameter sets, eradicating
terrorists should involve greater reliance on fire at first, with water tactics being
used predominantly if not exclusively after the initial assault has brought down
the number of terrorists. For the base case parameters that switching point is
to the right of the DNS point, so moving away from the DNS point only involves
using water controls in great volume to drive terrorists down to the low-level
steady state, less if one is merely delaying growth to the high-level steady state.
The location of that switching point - and, hence, the circumstances under
which fire controls should be used - is moderately sensitive to changes in pa-
rameter values. If it moves sufficiently far to the left, it can always be optimal
to use fire tactics, although the intensity of fire tactics still seems to always be
increasing in the number of terrorists. Conversely, if it moves sufficiently far to
the right it may not be optimal to use fire tactics unless the number of terrorists
is very large.
Analyzing this simple model may not seem very practical given the complex-
ities of managing counter-terror operations, but precisely because of the model’s
simplicity, a fortiori a number of important conclusions emerge.
First, if indeed, as some suppose, counter-terror operations can stimulate
recruitment of new terrorists, that can have important implications for how the
terror war should be fought.
Second, even if some counter-terror operations do stimulate substantial new
recruitment and other available tactics do not, that does not necessarily im-
ply that tactics which can stimulate recruitment should never be used. Their
benefits may exceed their downside if they are sufficiently effective.
Third, if some counter-terror tactics are more likely than others to be per-
ceived of as outrageous or otherwise to stimulate relatively more new terrorist
recruitment, then the optimal mix of terror control operations should vary, per-
haps dynamically over time with the changing state of the terrorists.
Fourth, if recruitment is concave in the number of terrorists and the effec-
tiveness of counter-terror tactics proportional to the number of targets, then the
intensity with which those recruitment-stimulating tactics should be employed
will generally be increasing in the current number of terrorists. So if the de-
cision is made to eradicate the terrorists, the extent to which fire tactics are
used should decrease over time. Water strategies should always be used and are
relied on most heavily when the number of terrorists is small.
