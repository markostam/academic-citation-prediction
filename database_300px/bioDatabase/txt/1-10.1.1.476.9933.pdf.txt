Service Quality Gap and Customers’ Satisfactions of 
Commercial Banks in Malaysia 
Izah Mohd Tahir * and Nor Mazlina Abu Bakar** 
 
Commercial banks play a significant role in the economy, making up one of the 
biggest provider of services in the Malaysian economy. Hence, providing better 
service quality is vital as banks have to compete for customers. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the level of service quality of commercial banks in 
Malaysia from the perspective of bank customers and assessing the 
satisfactions towards the services provided by the commercial banks. A 
questionnaire used in this study is limited to a sample of 300 respondents in 
the East Coast region of Malaysia. The measurements used were based on 
widely accepted SERVQUAL model (Parasuraman et. al. 1985, 1988, 1991). A 
descriptive statistics analysis (mean and paired t-test) was used to evaluate the 
level of service quality of Malaysia’s commercial banks from the customers’ 
perspective. This study examined the service quality gap by comparing 
customers’ expectations and their actual perceptions. In addition, this study 
focused on their satisfactions towards the service provided by commercial 
banks. The results of the study indicated that the overall service quality 
provided by the commercial banks was below customers’ expectations. 
Responsiveness was rated as the most important dimension followed by 
reliability, tangibility, assurance, and empathy. Further, the findings also found 
that customers were slightly satisfied with the overall service quality of the 
banks.

1. Introduction 
Commercial banks form the largest and are the country’s most important group of 
financial institutions.  With stiffer competition among domestic and foreign banks, 
therefore it is important for the commercial banks in Malaysia to improve the 
quality of their services.  Further, increased in consumer preferences toward 
banking products choosing the banks that give them the best service quality is a 
priority. As globalisation and liberalisation of financial institutions accelerate, 
competition among banks in offering products and services becomes more 
intense. Customers in Malaysia become more educated better informed, more 
internalized, and as Malaysian economy becomes more and more knowledge 
based, the demand for high quality services expands with increases in 
customers’ buying power.

Furthermore, with the merger process between banks in Malaysia to form only 
ten big banks with their partners, competition for clients among them is intense.  
Hence, commercial banking industry in Malaysia has to think strategically by 
providing high quality products and services to satisfy their customers.  In order 
for these banks to provide high quality products and services, they need firstly to 
investigate the level of customers’ perceptions and expectations to their service 
quality from their customers’ perspective. Through that information, they could 
then strategically adjust their service quality to fit the local and global markets. 
 
The purpose of this study was to examine the level of service quality in 
Malaysia’s commercial banking industry from the perspective of bank customers. 
The specific objectives were as follows: 
• To examine customers’ expectations and perceptions of service quality 
provided by the commercial banks in Malaysia 
• To assess customers’ satisfaction towards the service quality of 
commercial banks in Malaysia. 
The paper is structured as follows.  The next section, Section 2 outlines the 
literature review, while Section 3 details the data and methodology used in the 
study.  Section 4 presents the findings and Section 5 highlights the limitations 
and future research. Section 6 of this paper presents the conclusion and 
implication. 
2. Brief Literature Review 
Defining and measuring quality in services might be difficult due to the intangible 
nature of the service offering.  Many of the researches on service quality have 
been carried out within the framework of widely accepted service quality model 
(SERVQUAL instrument) developed by extensive research by Parasuraman et. 
al. (1985, 1988, and 1991).  Since then, many researchers have used this 22-
item scale to study service quality in different sectors of the services industry 
including financial institutions (Gounaris et. al. 2003; Arasli et. al. 2005).  
 
Basically, the service quality model was derived from the magnitude and 
directions of five gaps as follows: 
• Gap 1 (Understanding): the difference between consumer expectations 
and management perceptions of consumer expectations 
• Gap 2 (Service standards): the difference between management 
perceptions of consumer expectations and service quality 
specifications 
• Gap 3 (Service performance): the difference between service quality 
specifications and the service actually delivered 
 
Tahir & Bakar 329
• Gap 4 (Communications): the difference between service delivery and 
what is communicated about the service to consumers 
• Gap 5 (Service quality): the difference between customer expectations 
of service quality and customer perceptions of the organization’s 
performance 
 
Gaps 1 to 4 affect the way in which service is delivered and these four gaps lead 
to Gap 5. Therefore, the extent of Gap 5 depends on the size and direction of 
these four gaps (Gap 1, Gap 2, Gap 3 and Gap 4).   
 
In the banking industry, the study on service quality has been undertaken for 
example by Yavas et. al. (1997), Bahia and Nantel 2000; Lassar et. al., 2000; 
Duncan and Elliott, 2002; Jabnoun and Al-Tamimi, 2002; and Arasli et. al., 2005.  
 
In the study of service quality in the banking sector in Turkish banking, Yavas et. 
al. (1997), focused on the relationship between service quality on consumer 
satisfaction, complaint behaviour and commitment. Their study found that overall 
service quality was a significant determinant customer satisfaction, complaint 
behaviour and commitment.  
 
Bahia and Nantel (2000) suggested alternative scale for the measurement of 
perceived service quality in retail banking. Their study found that when 
comparing BSQ dimensions and SERVQUAL, it seemed that BSQ dimensions 
were more reliable than SERVQUAL. On the other hand, Lassar et. al. (2000) 
studied service quality using two major service quality constructs, SERVQUAL 
and Technical/Functional Quality models to the private banking industry. They 
found that Technical/Functional Quality-based model of service quality is better 
suited compared to SERVQUAL-based model.  Duncan and Elliot (2002) 
however explored the relationship between customer service quality and financial 
performance in Australian banks and credit unions. They found that there was 
significant relationship between financial performance and customer service 
quality scores.  
 
Jabnoun and Al-Tamimi (2002) examined service quality at UAE commercial 
banks using SERVQUAL model and included thirty items in the five dimensions 
of SERVQUAL.  When they tested the developed instrument for reliability and 
validity, they found that the instrument had only three dimensions.  
 
Finally, Arasli et. al. (2005) studied service quality perceptions of Greek Cypriot 
bank customers using SERVQUAL model. They however, extend the study by 
looking at the relationship between service quality, customer satisfaction and 
positive word of mouth. They found that the expectations of bank customers were 
not met where the largest gap was obtained in the responsiveness-empathy 
dimension. In addition, the reliability items had the highest effect on customer 
satisfaction, which in turn had a statistically significant impact on the positive 
word of mouth.

Contrary to the large number of studies of service quality in the banking industry 
in the west, studies are still considered scarce. In Malaysia, for example, studies 
on service quality were conducted by for example, Sudin et. al. (2004) and Izah 
and Wan Zulqurnain (2005). These two studies were conducted on Islamic 
financial institutions and adopted the CARTER model as suggested by Othman 
and Owen (2000; 2001). It is hoped that this study will be the platform for 
discussing the issues on service quality and customer satisfaction in the 
Malaysian banking industry. 
 
3. Data and Methodology 
The respondents selected were customers of commercial banks in three states in 
the East Coast region of Malaysia.  A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed 
and only 255 were useable for analysis 
The questionnaire designed for this study was based on the widely accepted 
SERVQUAL model.  A total of 22 attributes were categorized under five 
dimensions as follows: 
• Tangibility (4 attributes) 
• Reliability (5 attributes) 
• Responsiveness (4 attributes) 
• Assurance (4 attributes) 
• Empathy (5 attributes) 
 
The questionnaire was divided into four sections.  The first section was designed 
to measure the respondents’ expectations (E) regarding service quality in the 
banking industry.  The second section was related to respondents’ perceptions 
(P) of service quality actually provided by the commercial banking industry in 
Malaysia.  A five-point Likert Scale ranging from strongly disagree = 1 to strongly 
agree = 5, was used to measure the 22 attributes under five dimensions 
mentioned above. The third section dealt with the respondents’ satisfaction levels 
and lastly on demographic profiles of the respondents. 
Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) package will be used to analyse 
the data set. A frequency distribution was used to describe the sample. The 
mean and standard deviations of the attributes were also computed. Finally, 
paired t-tests were used to test the significant difference between sample means.

4. Findings and Discussion 
4.1 Analysis of Demographic Profiles of Respondents 
The sample of bank customers consisted of more females (59 percent) than 
males (41 percent).  More than 50 percent of the respondents had a University or 
college education. 28 percent of these respondents earned more than RM24,000 
per year and worked in the private sector (51 percent), public sector (19 percent) 
and the remainder (30 percent) worked either in semi government agency or self-
employed. 
4.2 Analysis of Service Quality Gap (Gap 5) 
This analysis was done in order to measure the gap between the customers’ 
expectations and their perceptions of the commercial banking industry, based on 
the 22 items or attributes pertaining to service quality.  In computing the paired-t 
test of SERVQUAL scores, 22 statements of the SERVQUAL in the questionnaire 
which represent the expectations and perceptions statements were grouped and 
linked according to the five dimensions as mentioned earlier.  The results are 
presented in Table 1. 
In the table, a negative gap indicates that customers perceived that the level of 
service provided by banks did not meet their expectations. On the other hand, a 
positive gap indicates that customers perceived that the level of service quality 
exceeded their expectations.  A comparison of bank customers’ actual 
perceptions of service quality with their expectations, using paired t-test, showed 
a statistically significant difference on all the 22 attributes examined.  The biggest 
gaps (≥0.50) were found in the following attributes; 20 “staff giving customers 
best interest at heart” (-0.54 sig. <0.50), 8 “staff performing services right the first 
time” (-0.51 sig. <0.50), and 12 “staff willingness to help” (0.51 sig. <0.50).  
These attributes in those dimensions were the most serious shortfalls and require 
serious attention by banks in terms of making improvements.  The bigger the 
gap, the serious the level of service quality is from the customers’ point of view. 
The overall Gap 5 score was -0.36 (sig. <0.05), which indicated that, the overall 
service quality provided by the commercial banks was below customers’ 
expectations. When we ranked the dimension according to gap scores, we found 
that the biggest gap (-0.42) was pertaining to responsiveness followed by 
assurance (-0.39),  reliability (-0.37), empathy (-0.35) and tangibility (-0.27).

4.3 Analysis of Customers’ Satisfactions 
The purpose of analyzing customers’ satisfaction in this study was to confirm the 
degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction as a result of high or low service quality 
level. The respondents were asked to rate statements based on their level of 
satisfaction; from 1 to 5 where 1 = extremely dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = 
neutral, 4 = satisfied and 5 = extremely satisfied. The table showed that the mean 
for overall customers’ satisfaction was 3.64, personal contact was 3.44 and 
quality of service was 3.63. This indicates that customers were slightly satisfied 
with the service provided by the commercial banks in Malaysia.

5. Limitations and Future Research 
 
The main limitation of this study, although it may be overcome in future research, 
is that all the data were gathered from a single region. It would be interesting to 
replicate the study on a national sample. This would provide a better 
generalization for the banking sector. Additionally, since Malaysia aspires to 
become globally competent financial centre, it would be appropriate and relevant 
to replicate the study using international samples. This is because when banks in 
this country provide services to international customers such as business 
travelers, tourists, students and expatriates, in a way, it is just like exporting 
services to foreign markets while staying at home. Therefore, the quality and 
customer satisfaction issues attached to services are subject to international 
domains. 
 
6. Conclusion and Implication 
This study builds on earlier research by one of the authors and examines the 
level of service quality of Malaysia’s commercial banking industry from the 
 
Tahir & Bakar 334
customers’ perspective.  Customers’ perceptions are very important especially in 
the service industry such as the commercial banking industry since there is high 
customer involvement in the delivery of the service itself.  
The result of Gap 5 analyses showed that customers’ perceptions for commercial 
banking industry in Malaysia were consistently lower than their expectations.  
These negative gaps especially pertaining to “staff giving customers best interest 
at heart”, “staff performing services right the first time”, and “staff willingness to 
help” were important to consider in terms of making improvement efforts.  The 
bigger the gap, the serious the level of service quality that need to be improved, 
from the customers’ point of view. As an overall, the gap score was -0.36 which 
was considered low. The opposite was the case for Islamic banking where the 
overall gap score was slightly higher (-0.46 sig. <0.50). 
As an overall, customers of commercial banks in Malaysia were slightly satisfied 
with the services provided by the banks. However, banks should not be happy 
with these findings because all the attributes had negative scores and these need 
to be improved otherwise the gaps will widen and therefore cause serious 
shortfalls.  
Given today’s competitive environment, and in response to the quality push and 
the aspiration of the country to become a globally competent, at this juncture, we 
believe it is appropriate for the management of the commercial banks to seriously 
examine their  corporate quality programs and customer service system. In 
addition, they must also consider that their performance measures now have to 
place a value on better responsiveness to customer needs. These measures and 
changes can be expensive in terms of employee time and effort, but the 
management of these banks needs to find ways to overcome these hurdles, 
otherwise the increasing competition from international banks can shrink their 
market shares.
