ABSTRACT
The Genomes On Line Database (GOLD) is a web
resource for comprehensive access to information
regardingcompleteandongoinggenomesequencing
projects worldwide. The database currently incorpor-
ates informationonover 1500 sequencingprojects, of
which 294 have been completed and the data depos-
ited in the public databases. GOLD v.2 has been
expanded to provide information related to organism
properties such as phenotype, ecotype and disease.
Furthermore, project relevance and availability
information is now included. GOLD is available at
http://www.genomesonline.org. It is also mirrored at
the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology,
Crete, Greece at http://gold.imbb.forth.gr/
HISTORY AND GROWTH
GOLD (1,2) was created in 1997 with the aim to (i) monitor
all genome sequencing projects from instigation to completion
and (ii) provide the community with a centralized database
integrating diverse information related to those projects in the
form of hyper-text links to disparate web-based resources.
Few would have predicted that less than a decade later the
rate of genome sequencing would surpass even Moore’s law
for the increase of microprocessor computational power. We
anticipate that, as new sequencing technologies are intro-
duced, such as pyrosequencing (3), and the cost of existing
technologies continues to decline, the number of genome
sequences will continue to grow exponentially and the number
of research groups able to contribute genome sequences also
will dramatically increase. Therefore, the need for a searchable
database that comprehensively tracks genome projects to help
guide selection of new projects and provide up-to-date
overview statistics will only increase.
CURRENT STATUS OF THE DATABASE
Published complete genomes
From 350 projects at the time of its previous report (2), GOLD
has grown in providing information for 1575 genome projects
worldwide, today. Almost 300 of those projects are currently
being reported as completed with their sequences submitted to
public databases. These are reported in GOLD as Published
Complete Genomes. A genome publication is not always
available in the literature for these projects as quite often
submitters choose to release their sequence data to the com-
munity prior to publication. From the 297 complete and pub-
lished genome projects, 235 are bacterial, 23 are archaeal and
39 are eukaryotic.
Ongoing genome projects
In addition to the completed projects, there are currently 1263
ongoing sequencing projects. Of those, 697 are bacterial, 38
archaeal and 526 are eukaryotic projects. The latter includes
208 EST and 10 RST projects, in addition to the 308 genome
projects. These can be retrieved by using GOLD’s search
engine, selecting ‘EST’ or ‘RST’ or ‘Genome’ at the Type
field.
From the 1263 ongoing projects, 114 are also considered
complete at this point, i.e. the sequencing phase has been
completed but the data are not yet submitted to the public
sequencing repositories. These can be retrieved using the
search engine by selecting ‘Complete Unpublished’ at the
Status field.
GOLD is not limited to providing information on sequen-
cing projects for which results will become publicly available
at some point in the future. Rather, it seeks out and displays all
publicly reported projects, whether the actual data will become
public at some point or remain proprietary. It is our hope that
this will better serve researchers, agencies and sequencing
centres in the process of selecting new projects, or identifying
sources of currently existing ones. These projects can be

retrieved by selecting ‘Proprietary’ at the Availability field of
the Search page. GOLD currently has information for the
sequencing of 56 proprietary genome projects running at vari-
ous private companies. Usually only the information for the
sequencing project itself has been made available in these
cases. A total of 25 such projects are also considered com-
pleted.
Sequencing is currently being performed in a large variety
of sequencing centres, through a variety of funding sources
and analysis is presented in many different databases. As
displayed in the indexing link of the database, GOLD reports
sequencing projects from 566 sequencing centres, funded from
186 agencies, and links to 427 distinct databases that provide
sequence data analysis and information for the above genome
projects.
NEW DEVELOPMENTS
Since the last report (2), a number of additional data fields
have been added to the database. These include new data fields
available in the project tables, as well as in the search engine.
The project tables now have the following additional fields:
(i) GOLDSTAMP, a unique identifier for each project in the
database. This ensures that multiple projects for the same
species can be more easily tracked and distinguished. All
completed published projects receive a Gc-ID (‘c’ standing
for complete) project number that follows the order of com-
pletion of each project. All draft projects receive a Gi-ID (‘i’
standing for incomplete) project number which follows the
entry to the database order. In a similar manner, all metage-
nomics projects receive aGm-ID. In the future all EST projects
will receive a Ge-ID. Accordingly, there are three major types
of projects presented in the database, corresponding to the four
types of unique identifiers (i.e. genome, metagenome and EST
or RST). The search engine allows queries for each of these
three major data types separately, through the Type field. A
search or browsing can also be performed on the Goldstamp
IDs through the corresponding search field. (ii) GC content,
which displays the GC percentage of the organism, when
known. (iii) Contact information, which provides the name
and contact information of the PI responsible for a given
project. All these fields are available for either search or
browsing through the search engine.
The most important new development in the database is the
addition of new data types pertinent to the properties of the
organism or the sequencing project.
Under the first category three new fields have been added in
the Search page: Phenotype, Ecotype and Disease. Each of
these three fields has been populated with a number of attrib-
utes or keywords extracted from the literature or other public
sources such as NCBI’s Entrez Genome Project Database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi) or TIGR’s
Genome Properties (4). Phenotype includes attributes that
describe phenotypic properties of the organisms such as
Motility, Temperature growth, Oxygen requirements, etc.
Ecotype includes attributes related to the environment or hab-
itat the organism is usually found in (i.e. Aquatic, Soil, Host,
etc.). Finally Disease, includes attributes related to disease
names or patterns Although a standardized controlled vocabu-
lary to describe the above fields has not yet been developed,
where ever a similar attribute was identified to other public
resources, every effort was made to maintain the already exist-
ing vocabulary. As shown on the GOLD indexing information
page, there are currently 203 phenotypic related attributes,
117 related to Ecotype and 188 are disease related keywords.
Under the second category (i.e. properties of the sequencing
projects) two new fields have been added in the search page:
Relevance and Availability. Relevance refers to attributes that
provide information for the motivation behind the selection of
different projects (i.e. biotechnological, medical, environ-
mental or phylogenetic). Availability of the project, refers
to the anticipated data release plan that may become either
public or remain proprietary.
OVERVIEW STATISTICS
Although several different types of statistics, related to each of
the data fields, can be derived from the user at any point using
the search engine, the database also provides readily available
graphical overviews for specific data types. These are provided
through the link ‘Gold Statisitcs’ available on the home page
of the database and include the following data types.
Sequencing centers
More than half of the 1500 currently available sequencing
projects on GOLD are distributed among only six major
sequencing centres. On top of the list is the Joint Genome
Institute which is the Department of Energy sequencing facil-
ity with 18% of world production at this point. These represent
number of unique individual projects and do not correspond
in any way with the actual size of the project in number of
sequenced bases.
Phylogenetic distribution
The sampling bias (5) towards only three major bacterial
lineages (Proteobacteria 52%, Firmicutes 23%, Actinobacteria
8%) continues to persist despite the large increase in sequen-
cing projects (Figure 1). However, the total number of bacterial
phyla sampled for genome sequences has improved dramat-
ically since the last release of GOLD. The coverage of archaeal
and eukaryotic diversity by genome projects is also improving,
albeit largely from recently announced projects for which no
sequence data yet exist. With the advent of metagenomics
(6,7), it becomes even more imperative to have a large and
diverse set of reference genomes for separation and compar-
ative analysis of these complex, multi-genomic datasets.
Project relevance
Biomedical relevance continues to be the dominant motivation
for genome sequencing projects (44%) followed by biotech-
nological relevance (41%). The number of projects with Envir-
onmental relevance (12%) has dramatically increased over the
last two years, mostly due to the Moore’s Foundation Initiative
(http://www.moore.org/microgenome/default.asp) on sequen-
cing of marine microbes. Finally projects with Phylogenetic
relevance are restricted to just 3% and are mostly supported
from the NSFs Tree of Life program, and more recently from
the DOE community sequencing program.

DATABASE WEB AND SEARCH ENGINE
The exponential increase of the size of the data and the amount
of viewer hits brought the need for a transformation of GOLD
and adaptation of a three-tier architecture. This architecture
includes a Relational Database Management System, which
holds the data, web clients that view the data and a middle
interface that makes the connection possible. The new
architecture was implemented by the Postgres RDBMS
because it is very robust and also free, Perl which is the lan-
guage of preference when it comes to regular expressions and
displaying database content on a web interface. Postgres pro-
vides ‘binary tree (B-tree)’ indexing that make retrieval of data
fast and modules like the Perl DBI make getting data from a
database trivial. The looks of the web interface were retained
so as not to confuse the usual viewer but were enhanced by
more vivid readable fonts and images. The viewer also has the
ability to sort the displayed data according to almost any
possible data type. Finally the backend flat text files, out of
which the database tables get generated, also retained the old
format for the ease of use for the curators but now are holding
a lot more new data fields. The actual engine of GOLD is
completely different. Instead of pre-creating static html
pages out of flat text files, GOLD now is using PERL CGI
scripts that access the data from the Postgres database and
dynamically create the corresponding page according to the
viewers request. A very powerful search engine page gives the
ability to the user, of not only searching by any data field
possible, but also selecting which data types should be dis-
played for the returning results. This is possible by the con-
struction of the SQL query created from the selections/
deselections of the client. The SQL query takes advantage
of the relations between the different tables, retrieves the
results and passes them to the web CGI scripts, which then
display the results.
