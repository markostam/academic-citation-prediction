ABSTRACT
miRBase is the primary online repository for all
microRNA sequences and annotation. The current
release (miRBase 16) contains over 15 000
microRNA gene loci in over 140 species, and over
17 000 distinct mature microRNA sequences. Deep-
sequencing technologies have delivered a sharp rise
in the rate of novel microRNA discovery. We have
mapped reads from short RNA deep-sequencing ex-
periments to microRNAs in miRBase and developed
web interfaces to view these mappings. The user
can view all read data associated with a given
microRNA annotation, filter reads by experiment
and count, and search for microRNAs by tissue-
and stage-specific expression. These data can be
used as a proxy for relative expression levels of
microRNA sequences, provide detailed evidence
for microRNA annotations and alternative isoforms
of mature microRNAs, and allow us to revisit
previous annotations. miRBase is available online
at: http://www.mirbase.org/.
INTRODUCTION
miRBase is the primary online repository for microRNA
sequences and annotations. The main aims of miRBase
are:
(1) to curate a consistent nomenclature scheme by which
novel microRNAs are named;
(2) to act as the central repository for all published
microRNA sequences, and to facilitate online
searching and bulk download of all microRNA data;
(3) to provide human-readable and computer-parsable
annotation of microRNA sequences (for example,
functional data, references, genome mappings);
(4) to provide access to the primary evidence that
supports microRNA annotations; and
(5) to link to and aggregate microRNA target predic-
tions and validations.
The miRBase database was established in 2002 (then
called the microRNA Registry) to provide microRNA re-
searchers with stable and unique gene names for their
novel microRNA discoveries (aim 1) and an archive of
all microRNA sequences (aim 2) (1–3). Ofﬁcial gene
names assigned by miRBase should be used in the pub-
lished version of articles that describe their identiﬁcation;
gene names are assigned in conﬁdence for inpress manu-
scripts (1). The incorporation of short RNA
deep-sequencing data into miRBase as evidence for
microRNA annotation (aim 4) is described in this
update. Expansion of textual and functional annotation
(aim 3), and an aggregation service for the growing
number of microRNA target predictions and validations
(aim 5) are the subject of future work.
From its inception, miRBase was designed to be a
focused resource that could make and facilitate signiﬁcant
contributions in a rapidly growing ﬁeld. We currently
capture data types from user submissions and from pub-
lications that describe novel microRNAs, for example, the
experimental method used to identify the sequence.
Alongside the microRNA name, miRBase assigns a
stable accession number to each stem–loop and mature
sequence to allow tracking of improved annotations
between releases. The primary transcripts of almost all
microRNAs remain unannotated, but we aim to develop
a mechanism to include annotations as they are
determined. Where genome assemblies are available,
microRNAs are mapped to their locations, clusters of
microRNAs are highlighted, and overlaps with annotated
protein-coding genes are described. Families of
microRNAs are constructed, and links are provided to
entries in other databases, to predicted targets, and to
the primary literature. miRBase provides several
methods to access the sequence data: by browsing,
sequence similarity, genomic coordinate intervals,
keyword search and bulk download. MicroRNA gene

miRBase have been discussed previously (1–3). We focus
here on growth of the database, recent developments to
integrate deep-sequencing data, and future plans.
DATABASE GROWTH
miRBase is a vital tool for microRNA research. In order
to maintain the usefulness of the resource, we must
develop tools keep pace with increased rates of
microRNA discovery that have been facilitated by
next-generation technologies such as deep sequencing.
The number of microRNAs deposited in miRBase has
risen approximately exponentially (Figure 1). In the last
3 years alone, the number of microRNA sequences in the
database has almost trebled. At the time of writing,
miRBase (release 16) contains over 15 000 microRNA
loci, expressing over 17 000 distinct mature sequences,
from 142 species.
Current semi-automated procedures for building
miRBase entries from submitted data and from supple-
mentary data to publications have been sufﬁcient to
keep pace with historical rates of microRNA identiﬁca-
tion. Post-2007, almost all of the growth of miRBase has
been driven by deep-sequencing experiments. Each experi-
ment may discover 10s or 100s of novel microRNAs.
Many novel sequences are speciﬁc to a studied tissue or
stage and are not conserved between species. Each experi-
ment may also provide evidence for a large number of
pre-existing miRBase entries. The computational and
curational challenge involved in dealing with the increased
data volume is signiﬁcant. Our initial developments and
improvements to incorporate data from deep-sequencing
experiments into miRBase involve a sequence and read
visualization tool and a pipeline for rapid mapping.
These improvements provide the infrastructure to track
increased rates of sequence deposition in the coming
years. However, the number of publications that
describe microRNA experiments and functional analysis
is also increasing exponentially (Figure 1). For example, in
2009 alone, over 2300 articles in PubMed reference the
keyword ‘microRNA’ (including 477 reviews), only 8
years after the ﬁrst use of the term in the literature.
Curating the functional annotation contained in this
corpus is currently impossible. Recent improvements in
text-mining approaches for biomedical literature
[reviewed in refs (4,5)] provide some hope that automated
textual annotation of microRNAs may become feasible in
the medium term.
INCORPORATING DATA FROM
DEEP-SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS
As discussed, the majority of the evidence supporting
microRNA annotations now comes from deep-sequencing
experiments. We have developed an interface to view reads
from RNA deep-sequencing data mapped to microRNA
loci on the miRBase web site. Brieﬂy, we identify entries in
the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/geo/) with short-read data that map to references
discovering novel microRNAs. We extract the read se-
quences and counts from the GEO entry and map the
reads to the set of miRBase hairpin sequences for a
given organism using Bowtie (6) allowing at most two
mismatches between the read and the hairpin sequence.
Figure 1. Growth of the miRBase sequence archive (black) and the microRNA publication record (PubMed entries that reference the term
‘microRNA’, grey).
Nucleic Acids Research, 2011, Vol. 39, Database issue D153
The ﬁrst deep-sequencing data sets incorporated into
miRBase are from human, Drosophila melanogaster,
Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and three nematode genomes.
Additional data sets will be added rapidly. Ideally, all
microRNA sequences submitted to miRBase will be
linked to GEO submissions, or followed by the sub-
mission of the deep-sequencing data for inclusion in
miRBase.
Figure 2. miRBase view of deep-sequencing reads mapping to (A) dme-mir-317 and (B) ath-MIR2935 loci. Each unique read is mapped to the
stem-loop sequence (bottom), with the annotated mature sequence in miRBase highlighted (magenta), and the sum aggregated read counts from all
stored experiments shown (right). Reads with only a single copy are hidden. Data shown are from 14 experiments [dme-mir-317 (15)] and four
experiments [ath-MIR2935 (16)].
D154 Nucleic Acids Research, 2011, Vol. 39, Database issue
The view of deep-sequencing data can be accessed from
miRBase stem–loop and mature pages (Figure 2). Reads
can be ﬁltered by the number of mismatches to the hairpin
sequence, the read count and by experiment. Each experi-
ment is annotated with species, tissue, stage and method-
ology information. These tags enable the user to search for
experiments by tissue expression on the miRBase search
page (http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml). Read counts
for mature microRNAs are commonly used as a proxy for
relative expression levels. As the number of deep-
sequencing experiments increases, these data provide ex-
tensive information about the expression proﬁles of
microRNAs across tissues, stages and organisms. A good
example of the power of these data can be seen in the small
RNA data made available through the MODENCODE
project for D. melanogaster (7). The patterns of read
mappings also provide valuable evidence for relative abun-
dance of mature sequences from different arms, for
isoforms of mature microRNA sequences, and for the con-
ﬁdence in a given microRNA annotation. For example,
Figure 2 shows a number of isoforms of mature
microRNAs derived from both arms of the dme-mir-317
hairpin precursor. The dominant mature sequence from the
30-arm is 21 nt in length, whereas the mature sequence
annotated in miRBase 16 is extended to 24 nt. The
50-mature sequence is unannotated in miRBase 16. The
miRBase view of read data therefore provides the user
with a clear picture of the proﬁle of short RNAs generated
from a microRNA locus, and facilitates the correction of
errors and omissions in future releases.
DEEP-SEQUENCING DATA AIDS DISCRIMINATION
BETWEEN MICRORNAS AND OTHER RNA
SPECIES AND FRAGMENTS
Guidelines for microRNA annotation were established in
2003 (8), requiring evidence of expression of a 22 nt
sequence (for example, cloning, sequencing or northern
blot), together with evidence for a microRNA precursor
structure (predicted stem–loop ﬂanking the mature
sequence). Updated annotation criteria were recently sug-
gested to distinguish microRNAs from other classes of
short RNAs in plants (9). These standards have proved
extremely powerful in maintaining a clean data set of
microRNA sequences for the community.
The increased rates of microRNA detection afforded by
deep-sequencing technologies provide challenges to the
level of conﬁdence required to annotate a sequence as a
microRNA. A typical RNA deep-sequencing experiment
will identify millions of short sequences. Increased
coverage results in detection of sequences of ever-lower
abundance. It therefore becomes more and more
challenging to distinguish true microRNAs from frag-
ments of other transcripts, other short RNAs and
spurious transcription. The eukaryotic genome also
contains millions of predicted hairpins, so a ﬂanking
stem–loop structure should be considered necessary but
not sufﬁcient to annotate a sequence as a microRNA. If
poorly analysed, a single data set thus has the potential to
generate a large number of dubious annotations,
swamping the real microRNAs. However, correct inter-
pretation of RNA deep-sequencing data provides several
additional signals to help distinguish microRNAs from
other sequences. A number of recent publications have
attempted to deﬁne and use criteria based on patterns of
mapped reads (10–14), and a consensus set of guidelines is
starting to emerge:
(1) Multiple reads (10–20 are commonly used cutoffs)
support the presence of the mature microRNA (pref-
erably from multiple independent experiments);
(2) The reads map to an extended sequence region
(e.g. an assembled contig), and the sequence
ﬂanking the putative mature microRNA folds to
form a microRNA precursor-like hairpin with
strong pairing between the mature microRNA and
the opposite arm. Reads that map very many times
to a genome sequence should be discarded;
(3) Mapped reads do not overlap other annotated tran-
scripts (i.e. there is no evidence that the short reads
may represent fragments of mRNAs or other known
RNA types);
(4) Reads mapping to a locus support consistent process-
ing of the 50-end of the mature sequence (for example,
the majority of reads overlapping a given mature
microRNA annotation should have the same 50-end;
the 30-end may be signiﬁcantly more variable); and
(5) Ideally, reads will support the presence of mature
sequences from both arms of the predicted hairpin
(so-called miR and miR* sequences), and the
putative mature sequences should base-pair with the
correct 30-overhang.
Consistent 50-end processing (point 4 above), and ob-
servation of miR and miR* sequences (point 5) appear to
be crucial for discrimination between high-conﬁdence
microRNAs and fragments of other RNAs in deep-
sequencing data (10–12). Figure 2A shows the miRBase
view of deep-sequencing reads mapping to the
dme-mir-317 precursor region. The pattern of reads
clearly supports a high-conﬁdence microRNA annotation,
with over 65 000 reads from 14 experiments (15) support-
ing the 50-end of a mature sequence derived from the
30-arm of the hairpin, and over 5000 reads supporting
the miR* sequence [unannotated in miRBase (16)]. In
contrast, the pattern of reads overlapping the
ath-MIR2935 sequence does not support the annotation
of a microRNA (Figure 2B), with multiple offset reads
distributed across the locus. In addition, the Arabidopsis
reads shown are isolated from different Argonaute
complexes—the majority of reads are not associated
with the microRNA AGO1 complex, rather with AGO4
(16). These data suggest that MIR2935 should be
removed from the miRBase microRNA catalogue in
future releases.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
There are three main areas of future development of
miRBase currently planned. We invite feedback and
comments on these areas.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2011, Vol. 39, Database issue D155
Improvement of community contribution of and access to
microRNA data
miRBase is a community resource. The majority of the
primary sequence data is submitted by users. We plan to
improve methods and interfaces for both data access and
data submission. For example, webservices will allow pro-
grammatic access to all miRBase data, and batch search
and download tools will be made available. We plan to
allow users to add and update textual annotation in a wiki
interface. The Rfam database of RNA families (17) has
successfully developed a community annotation project
using Wikipedia (18).
Expansion to include microRNA candidates and
predictions
As discussed above, deep-sequencing experiments provide
the majority of novel microRNA annotations.
Next-generation experimental techniques also provide
low-level evidence for comparatively large numbers of
lower conﬁdence sequences, often published as candidate
microRNAs, which fall below the current standards and
are therefore not present in miRBase. We plan to extend
the database to include different classes of data as supple-
ments, with associated conﬁdence levels for each annota-
tion, for example:
(1) High-conﬁdence microRNA genes, with support for
the presence of both miR and miR*, sequenced in
many copies from many independent samples, as
described above;
(2) Predicted homologues of known microRNAs in
related organisms;
(3) Low abundance sequences, cloned or sequenced in
only a few copies, without miR* evidence;
(4) Sequenced short RNAs that are absent from
assembled genomes; and
(5) Computational microRNA predictions.
High-conﬁdence annotations will form the default
microRNA set that is most relevant to the majority of
users. Lower conﬁdence annotations will be provided as
supplements to those data. Their inclusion will encourage
validation of low conﬁdence sequences, and the availabil-
ity of experimental resources (for example, off-the-shelf
microarrays).
A microRNA target aggregation service
From 2006, miRBase provided a set of microRNA target
predictions, branded miRBase targets, in collaboration
with the Enright lab (2). In 2009, the miRBase targets
resource was devolved back into the Enright lab at the
EBI, and rebranded microCosm. In its place, we will
develop an aggregation service that integrates
microRNA target predictions from all the popular target
prediction sites [for example, TargetScan (19), PicTar (20),
microCosm, DIANA-microT (21), microrna.org (22)],
together with lists of validated microRNA target sites
[currently curated by resources such as TarBase (23),
miRecords (24), miRTarBase]. This will initially involve
displaying the top hits from each algorithm on existing
miRBase sequence pages. In the longer term, an interface
to search for hits from the aggregated algorithms will
be developed, and consensus predictions from subsets of
the algorithms will be provided. All results will link to the
original data sources. To eliminate any long-term curation
burden, we will accept depositions of microRNA target
predictions and validated targets from users and target
prediction groups.
