Abstract
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) plantlets were exposed to Cd
or Hg to study the kinetics of diverse stress indexes. In
the so-called beaker-size hydroponic system, plantlets
were grown in 30 lMof Cd or Hg for 7 d. Oxidative stress
tookplaceand increasedover time, a linear responsebe-
ing observed with Cd but not with Hg. To improve the
sensitivity of the stress assays used, a micro-assay
system, in which seedlings were exposed for 24 h, was
developed. Phytotoxicity ofmetals, quantiﬁed as growth
inhibition, was observed well before there was any
change in the non-protein thiol tissue concentration.
When measured with conventional techniques, oxida-
tive stress indexes did not show signiﬁcant variation. To
trace early and small plant responses to Cd and Hg,
a microscopic analysis with novel ﬂuorescent dyes,
which had not yet been exploited to any signiﬁcant
extent for use in plants, was conducted. These ﬂuores-
cent probes, which allowed minute cellular responses
to 0, 3, 10, and 30 lM of both metals to be visualized
in the roots of the alfalfa seedlings, were: (i) 29,79-
dichloroﬂuorescin diacetate that labels peroxides; (ii)
monochlorobimane that stains reduced glutathione/
homoglutathione (GSH/hGSH); and (iii) propidium iodide
that marks nuclei of dead cells. Oxidative stress and
cell death increased after exposure for 6–24 h to Cd and
Hg, but labelling of GSH/hGSH decreased acutely. This
diminution might be the result of direct interaction of
GSH/hGSH with both Cd and Hg, as inferred from an
in vitro conjugation assay. Therefore, both Cd and Hg
notonlycompromisedseverely thecellular redoxhomeo-
stasis, but also caused cell necrosis. In plants treated
with 1 mM L-buthionine sulphoximine, a potent inhibitor
of GSH/hGSH synthesis, only the oxidative stress symp-
toms appeared, indicating that the depletion of the GSH/
hGSH pool was not sufﬁcient to promote cell death, and
that other phytotoxic mechanisms might be involved.
Key words: Alfalfa, Cd, cell damage, ﬂuorescence, GSH/hGSH,
H2DCFDA, Hg, MCB, microscopy, oxidative stress.
Introduction
Due to diverse human activities, such as mining and
smelting, metal pollution is becoming a major risk to
many ecosystems. Among the pollution-producing metals,
cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) are regarded as non-
essential elements, with no known physiological functions.
They are extremely toxic to plants and animals, have a long
half-life and are extremely persistent in the environment
(Salt et al., 1995). Exposure of plants even to minute
concentrations may lead to the alteration of many cellular
processes and structures (Hall, 2000). One of the character-
istic effects of metal poisoning, observable at an early stage, is
a reduction in cell proliferation and growth (Schu¨tzendu¨bel
et al., 2001). It has also been associated with the appearance
of oxidative stress (Schu¨tzendu¨bel and Polle, 2002). Accu-
mulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to an
oxidative burst, is thought to increase cellular damage
through oxidation of several macro-molecules (Hall,

2000), such as lipids (Sandalio et al., 2001) and proteins
(Romero-Puertas et al., 2002). Some metals such as Fe2+ and
Cu+ might induce oxidative cell damage coupled to their
auto-oxidation, through Fenton-type reactions. However,
this type of reaction has not been described for either Cd2+ or
Hg2+ in plants (Schu¨tzendu¨bel and Polle, 2002), despite the
evidence of oxidative stress induction in different plants
after exposure to Cd (Lozano-Rodrı´guez et al., 1997; Dixit
et al., 2001; Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al., 2002) and to Hg (Cho
and Park, 2000). Therefore, plant redox homeostasis might
be compromised by the uptake of Cd and Hg.
Other cellular responses observed after addition of heavy
metals are changes in thiol-peptide metabolism (Rauser,
1991). Hence, accumulation of phytochelatins (PCs) might
play a central role in metal detoxification (Cobbett and
Goldsbrough, 2002). Phytochelatins are synthesized by
phytochelatin synthase from reduced glutathione (GSH),
the major non-protein thiol in plants, and key for many
functions in plant metabolism. Several plants accumulate
homologous non-protein thiols with changes in their
constituent amino acids; for example, in legumes the
glycine of GSH is substituted by alanine, producing
homoglutathione (hGSH; Matamoros et al., 1999). The
balance between the reduced and the oxidized form of
glutathione (GSSG) is crucial for the enzymatic systems
that scavenge ROS (Noctor et al., 2002). A common
response to heavy metals is depletion of GSH, and a sub-
sequent raise of GSSG (Rauser, 1995; Xiang and Oliver,
1998). Moreover, some authors link the drainage of GSH,
caused by the synthesis of PCs, to the impairment of the
cellular redox status (Meuwly and Rauser, 1992; Noctor
et al., 1998; Xiang and Olivier, 1998). Taken together,
these previous reports suggest that maintenance of the
GSH pool is important for plant tolerance to metals.
To study oxidative stress in response to heavy metals,
a plethora of experiments have been carried out, using
different plant species, doses of metals, and exposure times,
as reviewed by Schu¨tzendu¨bel and Polle (2002). In most of
the studies, oxidative stress symptoms appeared when
treatments were long enough to attain substantial metabolic
changes. In such experiments, the effects caused by
relatively long exposure to metal might reflect a general
failure of the plant metabolism. Little is known about the
early stages. Even though toxic metals can clearly induce
oxidative stress, the mechanisms underlying this cellular
response remain to be elucidated. The development of new
microscopy techniques and the increased availability of
more sensitive and specific fluorescent probes makes it
possible to trace minute changes of various physiolog-
ical parameters at cell level in vivo (Fricker and Meyer,
2001). Thus, using monochlorobimane (MCB), cellular
GSH content was analysed recently in several plant tissues
(Sa´nchez-Ferna´ndez et al., 1997; Hartmann et al., 2003),
some of them subjected previously to salt stress (Gutie´rrez-
Alcala´ et al., 2000). In addition, cellular ROS accumulation
at several developmental stages under induced oxidative
stress has been followed by the oxidation of 29,79-
dichlorofluorescin diacetate (H2DCFDA) to fluorescent deriva-
tives, i.e. 5- (and-6)-carboxy-29,79-dichlorofluorescein (Allan
and Fluhr, 1997; Potikha et al., 1999; Bethke and Jones,
2001). The referred novel fluorescent dyes, which have not
yet been exploited to any significant extent in plants, might
help in understanding the processes, which occur in cells
exposed to toxic metals, by allowing them to be followed in
a more precise way. Here it is reported how these fluores-
cent probes and fluorescence microscopy were used to study
early stress symptoms in root epidermal cells of alfalfa
(Medicago sativa) exposed to Cd and Hg for 6 h and 24 h.
It was possible to visualize minute damage caused by both
metals, as observed by increased oxidative stress, higher
level of cell death, and depletion of the GSH/hGSH pool.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Stocks of 100 mM MCB and H2DCFDA in DMSO were stored at
–20 8C in 10 ll aliquots. Aliquots were thawed and diluted immedi-
ately prior to use. Propidium iodide (PI) was prepared as a 1 mg ml1
stock solution in deionized water and used at a final concentration of
25 lM. All dyes were purchased from Molecular Probes. A stock
solution of 100 mM L-buthionine sulphoximine (BSO; Sigma) was
prepared in deionized water, and stored at 20 8C. 3(CdSO4).8H2O
and HgCl2 were analytical grade purchased from Merck.
Plant material
Seeds of Medicago sativa var. Aragon were surface-sterilized for
5 min in 5% (v/v) commercial bleach. After rinsing several times with
sterile water, seeds were soaked overnight at 4 8C and allowed to
germinate on 1.5% (w/v) agar (Pronadisa), in square Petri dishes
(10310 cm), in complete darkness for 24 h at 28 8C. Homogenous
seedlings were chosen and carefully transferred to the beaker-size
and micro-assay hydroponic systems.
Beaker-size hydroponic system
Preliminary analyses of metal-induced stress were performed in the
so-called beaker-size hydroponic system. Selected seedlings were
placed in plastic grid holders, suspended in glass cylinders containing
150 ml of Murashige–Skoog nutrient solution at pH 6.0 (Duchefa
Biochemie). Continuous aeration was provided, and plants grew for
12 d under controlled environment conditions (16 h light photoperiod
at an average photon flux of 150 lmol m2 s1, at 25 8C day/18 8C
night). Heavy metals were then supplied at a high concentration
(30 lM) to ensure quick plant responses, and samples were taken at
different intervals from the beginning of the metal treatments.
Micro-assay system
Selected seedlings were transferred to the so-called Fa˚hraeus slides
culture system (Heidstra et al., 1994). Seedlings were carefully
placed in a frame like a sandwich, which was hand-made by sticking
a coverslip over a microscope slide with several drops of silicone
adhesive/sealant. The frames were kept in Schieferdecker glass
staining containers, filled with sterilized Murashige–Skoog nutrient
solution at pH 6.0, and kept under the same controlled environmental
conditions described above. This system provided a suitable medium
for plant growth, where seedlings acclimatized for 24 h prior to

treatment with Cd or Hg, at 0, 3, 10, and 30 lM final concentration,
or with 1 mM BSO as indicated. Then, plants were allowed to grow
for a further 24 h.
Growth measurements
Roots from the beaker-size experiment and seedlings from the
microscopic system were sampled at regular intervals (8–10 plants),
and maximum root or seedling length was measured. Growth was
expressed relative to control plants, and data given were the average
of at least three independent experiments 6standard deviation,

the heavy metal treatment and C is the control:

Oxidative stress indexes
Lipid peroxidation: Lipid peroxidation was estimated in vitro after
the formation of malondialdehyde, a by-product of lipid peroxidation
that reacts with thiobarbituric acid. The resulting chromophore
absorbs at 535 nm, and the concentration was calculated directly
from the extinction coefficient of 1.563105 M cm1. Ground frozen
tissue (0.1–0.2 g) was transferred to a screw-capped 1.5 ml Eppendorf
tube, and homogenized following addition of 1 ml of TCA–TBA–
HCl reagent [15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA), 0.37% (w/v) 2-
thiobarbituric acid (TBA), 0.25 M HCl, and 0.01% butylated
hydroxytoluene]. After homogenization, samples were incubated at
90 8C for 30 min in a hot block, then chilled in ice, and centrifuged at
12 000 g for 10 min. Absorbance was measured at 535 nm and 600
nm, the last one to correct the non-specific turbidity.
Protein oxidation: Proteins were extracted from 0.5 g ground frozen
tissue with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer [0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer,
0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF at pH 7.4].
After centrifugation at 12 000 g for 15 min, protein concentration was
determined in the supernatant using the Protein Assay reagent
(BioRad), with thyroglobulin as standard. Protein oxidation was
measured as carbonyl concentration, following the protocol described
by Romero-Puertas et al. (2002), with minor modifications. After
incubation with 10 mM dinitrophenylhydrazine, proteins were pre-
cipitated with 20% TCA. To facilitate pellet re-dissolution, excess
acid was washed with 10% H2O in ethanol:ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v).
The pellet was disrupted using an Eppendorf potter, and then
incubated at 40 8C for 30 min. After incubation, the suspension
was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min, and absorbance was measured
at 370 nm (carbonyl concentration) and at 280 nm (total protein
concentration).
Analysis of non-protein thiols by HPLC
HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) was used to
quantify non-protein thiols in acidic extracts. Plant tissue was ground
in liquid N2, and 0.1 g of frozen powder was thoroughly mixed with
300 ll of 0.25 N HCl. To quantify them, a spike of N-acetyl cysteine
(N-AcCys) was added as internal standard prior to homogenization
(Howden et al., 1995) at a final concentration of 50 lM. The
homogenate was centrifuged twice for 15 min at 12 000 g and at 4 8C
in Eppendorf tubes. The clear supernatant was transferred to a boron–
silica glass injection vial. The separation and detection protocol used
was that of Meuwly et al. (1995) with minor changes. One hundred
and twenty-five microlitres was injected in a PLRPS C18 column
(25034.6 mm; Polymer Laboratories) coupled to a Kromasil-C18
precolumn (3034.6 mm; Scharlab), and eluted with a gradient of
solvent A [98:2 H2O:acetonitrile (v/v) plus 0.01% TFA] and solvent
B (2:98 H2O:acetonitrile (v/v) plus 0.01% TFA). The gradient
programme, as for % solvent B, was: 2 min, 0%; 25 min, 25%; 26
min, 50%; 30 min, 50%; 35 min, 0%, 45 min, 0%. The chromatog-
raphy was performed in the Alliance 2695 HPLC system (Waters).
Detection was achieved after post-column derivatization with Ell-
man’s reagent [1.8 mM DTNB (5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid)
in 300 mM K-phosphate, 15 mM EDTA at pH 7.0]. The reaction took
place in a thermostatted 1.8 ml reactor at 37 8C, as described by
Rauser (1991). The derivative compound, 5-mercapto-2-nitroben-
zoate, had an absorption maximum at 412 nm.
Dye loading and ﬂuorescence microscopy
Confocal laser scanning microscopy: A TCS SP2 confocal micro-
scope (Leica) was used to visualize GSH levels in intact roots after in
vivo conjugation with MCB in a reaction catalysed by GST enzyme,
yielding a GSH–MCB conjugate (Fricker and Meyer, 2001; Meyer
et al., 2001). Labelling was carried out for 15–20 min with a solution
containing 1 ml of 25 lM MCB and 5 mM sodium azide, keeping the
seedlings all the time in the micro-assay system frames. Azide was
used to deplete ATP levels, and thereby to avoid ATP-dependent
vacuolar sequestration of fluorescent conjugate, which could undergo
quenching of the fluorescence signal. To monitor cell death, PI was
added as a counter-stain to a final concentration of 25 lM. PI marks
the condensed nuclei of dead cells when it permeates damaged
plasmalemma, and also labels the whole cell walls. The fluores-
cent GSH–MCB conjugate was excited with an argon-UV laser (351–
364 nm) and the emission monitored at 477 nm. In a second channel,
a helium–neon laser (543 nm) excited PI, its emission being recorded
at 620 nm. Microscopy images shown represent observations of at
least 10 independent experiments.
Epifluorescence microscopy: The cellular peroxidation level was
studied after labelling for 10–15 min with a 10 lM H2DCFDA
solution, and PI was also added as a counter-stain to a final
concentration of 25 lM. Samples were observed by epifluorescence
microscopy with a BX61 microscope equipped with a U-M51004V2
cube and coupled to a DP70 CCD camera (Olympus). Segments
subjected to morphological analysis corresponded to root hairs nearly
finishing elongation, when most of the hair tip is vacuolized.
Quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence staining
Confocal laser scanning microscopy: GSH–MCB adduct formation
and PI labelling were quantified as average pixel density of each
fluorescence channel, in defined regions of interest, with Leica
confocal software. The data, taken from at least five independent
snapshots from different roots, were corrected against the background
signal according to the manufacturer instructions.
Epifluorescence microscopy: Cell peroxidation and death were
subjected to manual morphological analysis, annotating the number
of cells showing green fluorescence of oxidized H2DCFDA and
condensed nuclei labelled with PI. Data were expressed as a percent-
age of the total number of cells visualized in the field under analysis.
In vitro GSH–MCB conjugation and GST activity
Several assays were performed in a fluorescence plate reader to test
in vitro conjugation of GSH with MCB, and to quantify the extent
of fluorescence quenching caused by Cd and Hg. Glutathione S-
transferase (GST) enzyme (0.2 U; Sigma), prepared from a stock
solution (0.2 U ll1 in 25 mM TRIS–HCl buffered at pH 7.0, diluted
prior to use in 30 ll of reaction buffer made of PIPES 200 mM, at pH
6.5), was added to each well of a 96-well microtitre plate (flat dark
bottom; Bibby Sterilin) previously filled with 110 ll of miliRO H2O.
Subsequently, 10 ll of different stock solutions of GSH were added
to obtain final concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mM. Heavy metals
were supplied to reach final concentrations from 0.05 to 0.4 mM, by
transferring 25 ll of the appropriate stocks of Cd or Hg. After

incubation for 30 min, the reaction was triggered by adding 25 ll
MCB (final concentration of 25 lM). Fluorescence was measured in
a fluorescence plate reader (Spectrafluor; TECAN) at 485 nm, after
excitation at 400 nm.
Endogenous GST activity of M. sativa seedlings was determined in
vitro using a similar experimental procedure to that described above.
Extracts were prepared from N2 (l) frozen tissues: 0.1 g of frozen
ground material was homogenized in extraction buffer at a 1:2 (w/v)
ratio [25 mM TRIS–HCl at pH 7.8, 1 mM dithiothreitol; supple-
mented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride and protease
Ccocktail inhibitor (P2714; Sigma)], in the presence of 1% poly-
vinylpolypyrrolidone (w/w), using a chilled mortar, keeping material
at 4 8C in all subsequent steps. The homogenate was clarified by
centrifuging for 15 min at 16 500 g. The protein concentration in the
resulting extract was determined using the protein assay reagent
(BioRad), with thyroglobulin as standard. Ten milligrams of protein
were added per well of a 96-well microtitre plate, containing the same
components as described above (except metals), and the reaction was
also triggered by adding 25 ll of MCB to a final concentration of 25
lM. GST activity in plant extracts (lmol GSH–MCB min1 mg1
protein) was calculated in the linear range of the assay, using 0.02
lmol min1 mg1 of commercial GST activity as standard (Sigma).

Results
Ca- and Hg-dependent growth inhibition and
oxidative damage
High concentrations of both metals, well over the levels
found in polluted areas (30 lM), were used to find the
earliest deleterious effects in M. sativa plants. In the beaker-
size hydroponic system, both metals clearly produced
a severe reduction in plant root length. Cd caused a contin-
uous growth inhibition, reaching values around 30% after
7 d of treatment (Fig. 1A). However, Hg-treated plants
suffered an abrupt inhibition (30–40%) within the first 24 h
of exposure, an effect that remained almost constant until
the end of the experiment (Fig. 1A). Lipid peroxidation in
shoots and roots from plants exposed to Cd also increased
continuously, and reached maximum levels after 7 d (Fig.
1B, C). Hg caused a sudden increment of lipid peroxidation
in both shoot and root before 24 h, and the peroxidation
level remained stable at the different times analysed (Fig.
1B, C). Another oxidative stress parameter assessed was
protein oxidation, which obtained a very similar pattern to
lipid peroxidation. There was a persistent increase for Cd,
with the highest levels after 7 d of treatment, and a sharp
rise with Hg within the first 24 h that continued steadily
through the experimental time (data not shown).
To evaluate how genuine the observed stress indexes
caused by metals through the time were, a regression
analysis was carried out. Thus, Person’s coefficient
(0.92–0.98) revealed that responses of Cd-treated plants
adjusted clearly to a line (Fig. 1). However, plants exposed
to Hg showed lower Pearson’s coefficients for growth
inhibition (0.73) and increased malondialdehyde (below
0.50 in shoots and roots). These data do not adjust well to
a line; once a high first value is reached, it remains in
a steady state, indicating that Hg caused both a stronger
and an earlier damage than Cd.
It appears that in Hg-treated plants the early linear range
in the plant response could have been missed, as it might
have taken place within the first 24 h (Fig. 1). To test
this hypothesis, the sampling period was shortened by

using the micro-assay system, which consequently permit-
ted the analysis of early metal effects. The same stress
indexes as in the beaker-size system experiments were
analysed, but only growth inhibition reflected a toxicity
response to Cd and Hg (Fig. 2). Both metals caused
inhibition of seedling growth within 24 h, following
a steady linear increase from the beginning of the treatment.
In this case, Pearson’s coefficient values were 0.95 and 0.93
for Hg- and Cd-treated plants, respectively. Moreover, Hg
showed stronger toxic effects, as growth inhibition reached
40% after 24 h, while Cd only attained about 30% (Fig. 2).
Paradoxically, the oxidative stress indexes that respon-
ded clearly to Cd and Hg exposure in the beaker-size
system did not reflect a consistent response to both metals
during the sampling period of the micro-assay (data not
shown). However, growth was affected at the very begin-
ning of the treatments (Fig. 2), in agreement with the ef-
fects observed in Scots pine and poplar seedling roots
briefly exposed to Cd (Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al., 2001, 2002).
Analysis of non-protein thiols by HPLC
To explore a way of following early stress responses, the
variation in non-protein thiol composition (Cobbett and
Goldsbrough, 2002) was analysed. First, the main thiols
were identified in whole seedling extracts from plants
exposed to Cd or Hg in the microscopic assay (Fig. 3),
identification being achieved by co-injections with com-
mercially available standards. The major non-protein thiol
found corresponded to hGSH. Its concentration was around
300 nmol g1 FW (Table 1), a value that agrees with that
found in alfalfa by other authors (Matamoros et al., 1999).
The other identified peaks corresponded to cysteine (Cys)
and GSH, together accounting for <50% of the observed
hGSH concentration (Table 1).
New peaks, which corresponded to putative PCs, ap-
peared at longer times of elution in extracts from seedlings
treated with Cd after 24 h (Fig. 3B). This identification was
based on: (i) similar retention times observed for PCs by
Rauser, Meuwly, and co-workers using similar chromato-
graphic conditions (Rauser, 1991; Meuwly et al., 1995);
and (ii) the fact that the size of those peaks increased
concomitantly with prolonged exposure to Cd (data not
shown), a typical response of PC accumulation (Cobbett
and Goldsbrough, 2002). On the other hand, Hg exposure
had a milder effect on the accumulation of PCs, since only
traces were observed (Fig. 3C; Table 1). Similar results
were found in extracts from plants grown in the beaker-
size system; at longer exposure times, larger amounts of
putative PCs were found in Cd-treated plants than in those
supplied with Hg (data not shown). In addition, integration
of non-protein thiol peaks after 24 h of treatment revealed
a remarkable decrease of hGSH levels in Hg-treatments
while, in those exposed to Cd, the hGSH content was
similar to the control (Table 1). Even though differences in

thiol content were detected due to the exposure of seed-
lings to both metals in the micro-assay system, changes
were still subtle compared with the extremely toxic effect
found as growth inhibition (Fig. 2).
Confocal laser scanning microscopy of thiols
None of the parameters assessed using conventional tech-
niques reflected clearly the toxic effect of Cd and Hg found
as growth inhibition. Therefore, it was necessary to use
novel methods to visualize early plant responses to metal
toxicity. Recently, several authors described new micros-
copy techniques to visualize GSH in vivo, based on staining
it with MCB in a reaction catalysed by GST (Gutierrez-
Alcala´ et al., 2000; Hartmann et al., 2003). Since GST
recognizes equally GSH and hGSH to detoxify several
xenobiotics in M. sativa (Skipsey et al., 1997), and since
MCB was used for the histochemical staining of hGSH in
cowpea nodules (Dalton et al., 1998), it was thought that
by adding MCB it would be possible to observe GSH/hGSH
in vivo. As shown in blue pseudo-colour (Fig. 4A), GSH/
hGSH–MCB staining was observed in root epidermal cells
of alfalfa grown in control nutrient solution. To be sure that
this fluorescence was due to the binding of MCB to GSH and
hGSH, 1 mM BSO was added as a negative control. This
compound, a potent inhibitor of GSH synthesis, repressed
the accumulation of hGSH up to 50%, as analysed by HPLC
(data not shown). BSO had a drastic effect on MCB
fluorescence (Fig. 4B); root epidermal cells showed lower
level of blue pseudo-colour than seedlings grown in its
absence. Moreover, red fluorescence of PI was restricted to
the cell walls, showing very few condensed nuclei, similar
to what was observed in control seedlings (Fig. 4A).
Exposure of seedlings to 30 lM Cd or Hg for 24 h
produced a remarkable decrease in GSH/hGSH–MCB
staining (Fig. 4C, D). Quantification of pixel density after
6 h of treatment with 0, 3, 10, and 30 lM Cd or Hg revealed
that both metals also caused a GSH/hGSH–MCB fluores-
cence quenching, although to a lower degree than after
exposure for 24 h (Fig. 4E). Fluorescence levels were not
significantly different from BSO-exposed seedlings or
between different metal treatments.
Counter-staining with PI showed that cells suffered
necrosis upon exposure to Cd and Hg, with characteristic
condensed chromatin in the nuclei (Fig. 4C, D). The ratio of
PI was calculated against GSH/hGSH–MCB labelling
(the IP:MCB ratio) to estimate the degree of dead cells rela-
tive to the depletion of GSH/hGSH after 6 h and 24 h of
treatment (Fig. 4E). The highest values in the IP:MCB ratio
were observed in seedlings exposed to 30 lM Hg for
24 h, a treatment that led to numerous condensed nuclei and
very weak GSH/hGSH–MCB staining. This effect was less
pronounced in seedlings subjected to a shorter treatment
interval. On the other hand, seedlings grown in 1 mM BSO
for 24 h exhibited the lowest IP:MCB ratio in spite of
very low staining of GSH/hGSH–MCB. This might reflect
that fewer cells died than in plants grown in the presence
of Cd or Hg. The differences in the IP:MCB ratio were not
so evident after 6 h between seedlings treated with 1 mM
BSO and the metals given.
In vitro GSH–MCB conjugation assay
The fluorescence quenching of MCB in vivo caused by Cd
and Hg might have been due to: (i) depletion of GSH/hGSH
cellular content; (ii) blockage of the nucleophilic SH-
reacting group with the metal, which would limit the
formation of the GSH/hGSH–MCB adduct; or (iii) in-
hibition of endogenous GST, an enzyme involved in the
in vivo conjugation of GSH/hGSH with MCB. There is
evidence that Cd and Hg have the ability to form thiolate
conjugates with several non-protein thiols (Mehra et al.,
1996; Morelli et al., 2002). To assess this possibility, the
effects of various metal concentrations on the fluorescence
produced by different GSH concentrations were compared
(Fig. 5). Prior to MCB addition, GSH was allowed to
interact with the metal for 30 min. At increasing concen-
trations of both metals there was a sharp depletion of
fluorescence (Fig. 5). The quenching was stronger with
Hg, fluorescence reaching nearly basal levels at 0.05 mM
(Fig. 5B). Interestingly, addition of Cd caused a milder
quenching; fluorescence was above the basal levels at
0.1 mM and declined completely at concentrations higher
than 0.2 mM (Fig. 5A).

To rule out the possibility that fluorescent quenching
could be due to the inhibition of GST caused by the metals,
endogenous activity of M. sativa seedlings was determined.
GST in vitro activity of extracts from seedlings exposed
to 0, 3, 10, and 30 lM Cd or Hg was in the range of 0.94–
1.05 lmol min1 mg1 protein. No significant differences
(P <0.05) were found between treatments.
Epiﬂuorescence microscopy of oxidative stress
symptoms
Cell peroxides can be detected in vivo with a fluorescence
microscope by the oxidation of the fluorogenic substrate
H2DCFDA (Bethke and Jones, 2001). Using this fluores-
cent probe, root seedlings were analysed after 24 h
treatment with 30 lM Cd or Hg. In addition, roots were
counterstained with PI to evaluate cell viability. In un-
treated roots there were few cells with green fluorescence or
red spots corresponding to necrotic nuclei; PI only labelled
the cell walls of living cells (Fig. 6A). This indicated low
stress and that the viability was not compromised. To check
proper loading of H2DCFDA, root segments were damaged
mechanically with forceps. As a result of such manipula-
tion, a strong green fluorescent signal could be observed
(data not shown). This fact demonstrates that mechanical
stress also produces oxidative damage, and emphasizes that
careful manipulation is important in the preparation of the
material used when minute alterations caused by heavy
metals are analysed.
A different staining pattern was observed between plants
grown in the presence of 30 lM Cd or Hg (Fig. 6E, G). Cd
induced oxidative stress, as several epidermal cells glowed
in green fluorescence of H2DCFDA (Fig. 6E, grey arrows)
and some nuclei were highlighted in red by PI (Fig. 6E,
black arrows). However, in epidermal cells of Hg-treated
seedlings only red condensed nuclei were observed (Fig.
6G, grey arrow). In parallel, root hair architecture was
affected by both metals, as could be observed with dif-
ferential interference contrast (DIC) optics (Fig. 6F, H). By
contrast to healthy control root hairs (Fig. 6B), incipient
plasmolysis and loss of root hair cytosolic content was also
observed.
Because growth inhibition analysis showed that phyto-
toxic effects of both metals could be visualized earlier than
24 h (Fig. 2), the different patterns of toxicity with Cd and
Hg were assessed in samples subjected to increasing doses
of each metal at 6 and 24 h of exposure (Table 2). In general,
symptoms of stress were clearly visible after only 6 h of
exposure, and few differences in peroxidation and cell death
staining could be observed with seedlings exposed for
a prolonged period. Even at the lowest metal concentration,
there were clear differences compared with control seed-
lings; when grown in 3 lM Cd, few cells showed green
labelling, and even fewer were dead. At increasing concen-
trations, the numbers of stained cells with both H2DCFDA
and PI also increased, meaning that at higher Cd concen-
trations more cells were stressed and dead. Hg had appar-
ently a stronger toxic effect, since after growing the plants in
3 lM Hg for 6 and 24 h there was a high percentage of
epidermal cells stressed and already dead, similar to the data
on seedlings exposed to 30 lM Cd (Table 2). Surprisingly,
on exposure to Hg over 10 lM the percentage of stressed
cells was similar to the control, but an extremely high
proportion of dead cells appeared. Therefore, cell viability
was acutely diminished after exposure to Hg. In addition,
a greenish blur highlighted the inner layers of the root (data
not shown), indicating that cells of the cortex and vascular
tissues were experiencing oxidative stress, an effect not
observed when Cd was supplied.
The addition of 1 mM BSO to the growing medium was
expected to increase green fluorescence due to a starvation
of GSH/hGSH, one of the main oxidative stress counter-
acting metabolites (May and Leaver, 1993). Indeed, BSO
leads to a remarkable increase in H2DCFDA fluorescence,
mainly located around the nucleus and at the plasmalemma
(Fig. 6C, grey arrow), indicating some degree of oxidative
stress (Table 2). As expected, this treatment caused a se-
vere reduction of GSH/hGSH, as measured by HPLC
(over 50% of the control; data not shown). However, this

affect the architecture of root hairs, as revealed through
visualization by DIC optics (Fig. 6D), suggesting that cell
viability was not completely compromised upon treatment
with BSO.
Discussion
The kinetics of Cd and Hg toxicity, which caused among
other symptoms oxidative stress, has been evaluated and
compared in alfalfa plantlets. Tracing the kinetics of plant
responses on short-term exposure to both metals would
help to identify the mechanisms underlying toxicity. First,
conventional methods were used to measure oxidative
stress indexes, such as lipid peroxidation or protein oxida-
tion. Data showed consistent responses in long-term treat-
ments with Cd and Hg, as shown in the beaker-size
hydroponic system (Fig. 1). However, the sharp inhibition
in root growth and lipid peroxidation observed after 24 h in
Hg-treated plants indicated that it is possible that an early

linear response had been missed. Thus, the microscopic
assay was used to shorten exposure to metal. In these
experiments, growth inhibition (Fig. 2) and qualitative and
quantitative non-protein thiol content variations (Fig. 3;
Table 1) revealed that plants were undergoing important
physiological changes upon exposure to Cd and Hg. In
particular, growth was inhibited very early, in agreement
with data from other authors on Pinus sylvestris and poplar
seedling roots supplied with 50 lM Cd (Schu¨tzendu¨bel
et al., 2001, 2002).
On the other hand, no clear symptoms of oxidative stress
could be detected by the conventional techniques used to
trace oxidative stress. It seemed, therefore, that a more
adequate methodology was necessary to trace rapid toxic
effects. With this aim epifluorescence analysis was em-
ployed, novel fluorescent probes being used to monitor
oxidative stress at the cellular level. Thus, the accumulation
of peroxides as a result of adding heavy metal was dem-
onstrated by H2DCFDA (Fig. 6E, G). It has permitted the
different ability of each metal to trigger various stress
responses in alfalfa seedlings, exposed for 6 and 24 h, to be
assessed. Comparing the toxic effects of each treatment at
both sampling periods, no significant differences in cellular
damage were observed, which might indicate that after 6 h
a remarkable degree of oxidative damage had already been
reached (Table 2). In a similar experimental design,
accumulation of H2O2 was followed in Scots pine seedling
roots using a histochemical staining that increased with
time (Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al., 2001), but detailed cellular
analysis could not be achieved. Counterstaining with IP
also revealed that cell death augmented concomitantly to
Cd concentration (Table 2; Fig. 6E). Paradoxically, Hg did
not trigger a clear increase in lipid peroxidation in epider-
mal cells (Fig. 6G). However, cell viability was drastically
reduced with rising concentrations of this metal, since cell
death reached high values (80%; Table 2). All these results
were supported by the increase in the IP:MCB ratio in
the experiments carried out to visualize changes in the
GSH/hGSH cellular pool by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4).
Finally, the inner root cells (i.e. cortex and/or endodermis)
of plants grown for 24 h in 30 lM Hg had a greenish glow
(data not shown), an effect that was not observed at 6 h of
exposure nor in plants treated with Cd. This might imply
that those cells were undergoing oxidative stress, probably
as cellular damage expanded to more internal layers of cells
in roots under Hg exposure. Taking all the data together, the
present results suggest that Hg produced a quicker and
stronger toxicity than Cd, as already suggested by the long-
term exposure in the beaker-size experiments. It is conceiv-
able that dead cells were metabolically non-functional and
had lost the capability to metabolize H2DCFDA, being
therefore unable to show up fluorescence. Consequently, no
green fluorescence could be recorded at the epidermis.
Similar conclusions could be drawn after observing visible
root hairs; Cd-treated plants showed slight cell damage
(Fig. 6F), whereas effects apparently more acute and
frequent were found in seedlings grown with Hg (Fig. 6H)
that suffered clear plasmolysis and loss of cytosolic content.
Fojtova´ and Kovaric (2000) found similar cellular damage
in tobacco BY2 cells cultured in the presence of 50 lM
Cd, where dense and shrunken protoplasts were visualized
after a 5 d treatment.
The accumulation of PCs in response to Cd and Hg was
relatively low after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3; Table 1)
compared with the cellular damage found; only Cd caused
the accumulation of a detectable amount of PCs. Another
significant change in non-protein thiol concentration was
the reduction in hGSH observed under 30 lM Hg for 24 h
(Table 1). Overall, these results were in agreement with
those reported for tobacco (Vo¨geli-Lange and Wagner,
1996), Arabidopsis (Xiang and Oliver, 1998), and pine
(Schu¨tzendu¨bel et al. 2001) after short-term treatments
with Cd. In these three cases, there were minor reductions
of GSH tissue content followed by increases at prolonged
exposure times. Indeed, a similar trend has also been
observed in alfalfa and maize plants grown in the beaker-
size hydroponic system for different exposure times (data
not shown). On the other hand, Hg is a poorer PC synthesis

inductor compared with Cd, both analysed in vitro, with
recombinant phytochelatin synthase (Ha et al., 1999), or
in vivo in Rubia tinctorum root cell cultures (Maitani et al.,
1996). Increasing evidence supports the idea of PCs been
involved only partially in metal detoxification, a mechanism
probably highly dependent on the metal supplied and the
plant species assessed (Landberg and Greger, 2004), as
found in the hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens
and other metallophytes (Ebbs et al., 2002; Schat et al.,
2002). Additionally, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana over-
expressing recombinant phytochelatin synthase was more
sensitive to Cd (Lee et al., 2003). Therefore, it is conceiv-
able that PCs are not the first mechanism involved in heavy
metal tolerance. However, they might probably work along
with other mechanisms in plants subjected to longer treat-
ments with metals (Cobbett and Goldsbrough, 2002).
GSH and hGSH are regarded as important metabolites
that contribute to the control of cell redox homeostasis
(May et al., 1998). It has been possible to monitor changes
in GSH/hGSH levels in alfalfa root cells after staining with
MCB, and an extensive quenching has been found associ-
ated with the supply of Cd and Hg (Fig. 4). The present
results are in agreement with those reported on A. thaliana
cells grown in medium containing Cd (10–1000 lM) and
Hg (1–100 lM) by Meyer and Fricker (2002), which
caused a severe MCB fluorescence depletion. This could be
due to direct interaction of the metals with the nucleophyllic
SH of GSH/hGSH, since there was an obliteration of the
fluorescence emitted by the GSH–MCB adduct in the
presence of both metals in vitro (Fig. 5). The production
of the GSH/hGSH–MCB adduct in vivo is mediated by
GST (Gutierrez-Alcala´ et al., 2000; Hartmann et al., 2003),
and an inhibition of the enzyme induced by heavy metals
might also account for the loss of fluorescence observed.
However, the present data on GST activity in vitro of
seedlings exposed to Cd and Hg indicate that the enzyme
was not affected by the heavy metals; therefore, GST seems
not to be limiting in the formation of the GSH/hGSH–MCB
adduct. The present observations are also in agreement
with the reported affinity of those metals to bind to
GSH, forming metal-thiolate compounds (Mehra et al.,
1996; Morelli et al., 2002). In particular, it is considered
that this might be the case in Cd-treated seedlings, which
experienced few changes in GSH and hGSH tissue contents
(Table 1). However, in Hg-treated seedlings the quenching
of MCB fluorescence might be partially attributed to the
significant depletion observed in hGSH (Table 1). There-
fore, upon exposure to Cd or Hg, the thiol residue of GSH
might be blocked by the formation of metal-thiolate bonds
or by its oxidation to GSSG, which would diminish the
reductant capability of the GSH/hGSH cellular pool. On
the other hand, the putative competition of Cd or Hg with
MCB to bind GSH/hGSH would make it difficult to ascertain
the fate (complexation and/or oxidation) of these thiols
under heavy metal stress by direct observation using confocal
microscopy. Indeed, the dynamic response of MCB staining
was less clear than that of H2DCFDA, since little difference in
fluorescence was observed between seedlings kept for 6 h at
several levels of metals in the growing solution (Fig. 4E).
As stated before, GSH and hGSH are important antiox-
idants (May et al., 1998), which are necessary for coping
with several environmental stresses. Depletion of GSH/
hGSH, as observed under treatment with 1 mM BSO (Fig.
4B), led to the appearance of oxidative stress in alfalfa
seedling roots to a high extent (Fig. 6C; Table 2), in
agreement with May and Leaver (1993). Interestingly, no
cell death was found, indicating that cells were still capable
of surviving in such conditions. However, under metal
stress, both cell death and oxidative stress appeared, de-
pending on the degree of toxicity (Fig. 6; Table 2). This
finding might imply that, with Cd or Hg, alteration of the
GSH/hGSH pool is not the only explanation of the
induction of metal toxicity, and other mechanisms of phy-
totoxicity might be involved. In this respect, it is known
that plants subjected to environmental stresses augment
their capability to draw back ROS (May and Leaver, 1993),
so that they can survive, but irreversible damage and cell
death occurs when that capability is overridden.
Summing up, a promising new and sensitive technique
that allows detection of minute changes in oxidative
damage, which might be useful to characterize cellular
responses to heavy metals, has been used. Subtle differ-
ences between Cd and Hg could be observed, indicating
different mechanisms of toxicity that eventually compro-
mise cell viability. Alterations in the GSH/hGSH cellular
pool in plants under heavy metal treatment could also be
detected. However, it was not possible to tell whether this
lower fluorescence level was due to a real GSH/hGSH pool
depletion or to a metal–thiolate complex formation. Work is
in progress to characterize in detail the putative metal–
thiolate interaction and the amount of heavy metals taken
up by discrete root cells.
