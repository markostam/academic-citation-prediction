Abstract 
  The signature of cold-core eddies and their role in altering the biological 
productivity of the Bay of Bengal was examined using two recent sets of 
hydrographic data collected along the central and western Bay of Bengal 
during fall (14 September – 12 October, 2002) and spring (12 April – 7 May, 
2003) intermonsoons under the Bay of Bengal Process Studies (BOBPS) 
programme. Based on the thermohaline structure and the satellite-derived 
sea-level anomaly maps 9 cyclonic eddies were identified.  Out of this, 4 
cyclonic eddies – 2 each along the central Bay and along the western 
boundary – occurred during fall intermonsoon 2002, while 5 occurred – 3 
along the central Bay and 2 along the western boundary – during spring 
intermonsoon. The eddy depressed the temperature, which varied from 3oC 
to 7oC at 120 m depth. Maximum depression of temperature was associated 
with spring-time eddies in the northern Bay, where subsurface stability was 
low. The reduced water column stability in spring leads to greater eddy-
pumping, thereby cooling the water to a greater extent. However, the 
cyclonic eddies were unable to break the stratification of the top 20m layer, 
thereby curtailing their effects below this depth during both seasons. Eddy-
pumping not only cooled the water column but also enhanced the nutrient 
concentrations. This in turn increased the biological productivity of the Bay 
to 1½-2 times. In addition, the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM), 
which is generally located between 40 and 70 m in fall and 60 and 90 m in 
spring intermonsoons, shallowed under the influence of the eddies and also 
enhanced the chlorophyll concentration in the SCM to more than double. 
Thus, eddy-pumping of nutrients controls the biological productivity of the 
Bay of Bengal during both the seasons. In the fall intermonsoon, however, 
the riverine input of nutrients and sediments in the northern Bay also plays a 
role in altering the biological productivity.  This has an overall implication 
to the basin-wide new production and export flux and, at least partly, 
resolves the reason for the comparable annual fluxes of organic carbon

1. Introduction 
 
   The Bay of Bengal, bounded in the north at around twenty-two degrees, is 
a tropical basin situated in the eastern part of the northern Indian Ocean. The 
dominant atmospheric forcing is the semi-annually reversing monsoon 
winds, southwesterly during June-September (summer/southwest monsoon) 
and northeasterly during November-February (winter/northeast monsoon), 
which causes a semi-annual reversal of the surface circulation as well. On an 
annual scale this basin receives excess precipitation over evaporation to the 
tune of ~ 2 m yr-1 (Prasad, 1997), while the runoff from the peninsular rivers 
amounts to about 1.625 x 1012 m3 yr-1 (Subramanian, 1993). The suspended 
sediment discharge associated with the river runoff into the Bay is estimated 
to be about 1.382 x 109 tonnes yr-1 (Subramanian, 1993).  The excess 
precipitation over evaporation and runoff freshen the upper layer waters of 
the basin. As a result, the annual mean surface salinity ranges from 30 
(practical salinity scale) in the north to 34 towards the southern part (Fig.1). 
Apart from freshening of the surface layers, the river discharge is expected 
to add nutrients to the upper layers and increase the biological productivity 
of the Bay. However, recent measurements using clean techniques 
(Madhupratap et al., 2003) corroborate the traditional concept that the Bay 
of Bengal is a region of lesser biological productivity. The reason for this is 
variously attributed to cloud cover, large sediment load, narrow shelf, 
stratification, etc (see Qasim, 1977; Sengupta et al., 1977; Radhakrishna, 
1978; Gomes et al., 2000). In a recent study Prasanna Kumar et al. (2002) 
 2
showed that the surface and the integrated chlorophyll a in the Bay of 
Bengal during summer monsoon was 4-5 times lesser than that in the 
Arabian Sea while the integrated primary productivity was about 8 times 
less. Based on the physical forcing, Prasanna Kumar et al. (2002) argued that 
this low biological production stems primarily from the lack of availability 
of nutrients in the upper layers arising from strong stratification and weaker 
winds, which curtail vertical mixing.  
   Contrary to the above pattern of chlorophyll and primary productivity in 
the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, sediment trap data shows that the 
average annual fluxes of organic carbon are comparable in both basins 
(Ramaswamy and Nair, 1994). This is intriguing considering the fact that 
there is no evidence of strong upwelling in the Bay of Bengal except for 
very localized upwelling close to the southwestern boundary during summer 
(Murty and Varadachari, 1968; Shetye et al., 1991) and that the 
comparatively weaker winds are unable to break the strong upper ocean 
stratification through wind-driven mixing. Thus, in the Bay of Bengal the 
traditional mechanisms of nutrient supply to the oligotrophic upper ocean 
waters such as wind-driven mixing, upwelling, aeolian dust input, etc. 
cannot account for the annual particle flux collected in sediment traps. Based 
on 2001 summer monsoon data, Prasanna Kumar et al. (2004) identified cold 
core eddies in the Bay of Bengal and proposed eddy pumping as a possible 
mechanism of vertical transfer of nutrients across the halocline to the 
oligotrophic euphotic zone during summer monsoon, when the upper ocean 
is highly stratified. This cold-core eddy was found to enhance the biological 
productivity by more than double. Though the existence of eddies in the Bay 
of Bengal has been documented by several authors (Ramasastry and 
Balaramamurty, 1957; Rao and Sastry, 1981; Legeckis, 1987; Babu et al., 
 3
1991; Murty et al., 1993; Shetye et al., 1993; Sanilkumar et al., 1997; Babu 
et al., 2003; Madhusoodhanan and James, 2003; Prasanna Kumar et al., 
2004) their role in the context of biological production is yet to be explored 
fully. An attempt towards this was made by Prasanna Kumar et al. (2004) 
using data collected during summer monsoon. In the present paper we 
examine the hydrographic data collected during fall and spring 
intermonsoons in the Bay of Bengal to identify the signature of eddies and 
explore their role in altering the biological productivity. The spring (March-
April) and the fall (September-October) intermonsoon seasons represent the 
primary and secondary heating season in the Bay of Bengal during which the 
winds are weak and variable (Narvekar and Prasanna Kumar, 2006). The 
fresh water discharge from peninsular rivers is the least during spring 
intermonsoon, while it is at its peak during end of summer and beginning of 
fall intermonsoon (August-September). Unlike this, the summer (June-
August) monsoon is characterized by strong (~10 m/s) and organized winds 
from southwesterly direction and high precipitation.  
 
2. Data and method 
 
   As a part of the Bay of Bengal Process Studies (BOBPS) to understand the 
seasonal cycle of the upper ocean variability and associated changes in the 
biogeochemistry, in situ measurements were carried out onboard ORV Sagar 
Kanya along two transects – in the central Bay and along the western 
boundary (Fig.1) – during fall (14 September – 12 October, 2002) and spring 
(12 April – 7 May, 2003) intermonsoons. The measurements in fall 
intermonsoon were aimed at capturing the effect of freshwater in put, while 
those in spring intermonsoon were to understand the effect of solar heating. 
In all 24 CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) stations were occupied at 
 4
1-degree intervals, 14 in the central Bay of Bengal along 88oE and 10 along 
the western boundary. A Sea-Bird CTD having a rosette sampler fitted with 
10/30-L Go-Flo bottles was used to obtain profiles of temperature and 
salinity in the upper 1000 m. CTD salinity was calibrated against water 
samples collected simultaneously and analyzed with a Guildline 8400 
Autosal. Water samples collected from various depths were analyzed for 
nitrate and silicate using a spectrophotometer. The detection limits for nitrate 
and silicate were 0.1 and 0.5 µM, while standard deviations were 0.02 and 
0.05 µM respectively. 
   In addition to the high-resolution physical and chemical measurements, 
nine biological stations (5 in the central Bay of Bengal and 4 along he 
western boundary) (Fig.1) were also occupied for over 24h for measuring 
primary production according to an in situ incubation protocol (UNESCO, 
1994). Details of these measurements are reported in Madhupratap et al. 
(2003). Briefly, water samples collected at pre-dawn from eight discrete 
depths (near surface, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m) by the CTD rosette 
sampler were used for measuring primary production (PP).  Water samples 
from each depth were collected into four 300 ml polycarbonate (Nalgene, 
Germany) bottles (three light, one dark). One ampoule of NaH14CO3 
(specific activity of 185 kBq; Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, 
Mumbai) was added to each bottle. Following this, all bottles were tied on to 
a mooring system before dawn and, incubated in situ at respective depths for 
12h. The mooring was in situ from just-before-sunrise to half hour past 
sunset. Uptake of 14C was measured by filtering 100 ml of sample from each 
bottle through GF/F filters (25 mm dia, 0.7 µm pore size, Whatman, USA); 
filters transferred into scintillation vials and exposed to HCl (0.5 N) fumes 
 5
overnight in a closed container. Five ml liquid scintillation cocktail (Sisco 
Research Laboratory, Mumbai) was added to each vial and, assayed for 
radioactivity in a scintillation counter (Wallac 1409 DSA, Perkin Elmer, 
USA).  PP rate was calculated and expressed as mg C m-3 d-1, 12h being 
considered as day (UNESCO, 1994). Chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations 
from samples collected at all the depths mentioned above were measured 
using a fluorometer (Turner Designs, USA). Sub-samples from these depths 
were filtered through 47mm GF/F filters and, the chl a was extracted in 10 
ml 90% acetone in the dark for 24h in a refrigerator and its concentration 
determined. Surface meteorological observations were also made along both 
tracks, and all the above measurements followed the JGOFS protocols 
(UNESCO, 1994). From the temperature and salinity data, geostrophic 
currents were computed with respect to 1000 m depth following the Helland-
Hansen method (Pond and Pickard, 1978).   
   In addition to the in situ hydrographic data, we also used remote sensing 
data on sea-level height and chlorophyll pigment concentrations. The 7-day 
snapshots of the merged sea-level anomalies of Topex-Posiedon/ERS 1/2 
satellites obtained from the AVISO (http://las.aviso.oceanobs.com) live 
access server having a spatial resolution of 1/3 of a degree, were examined 
during September-October 2002 and April-May 2003 to obtain the spatial 
structure of eddies inferred from the hydrographic data. From the sea-level 
anomalies velocities were computed assuming the geostrophic relation 
2Ωsin(φ).V = g tan(i), where Ω is the earth’s angular velocity, φ is the 
latitude, V is the velocity and tan(i) is the slope of the sea surface (Pond and 
Pickard, 1978).

The monthly mean chlorophyll pigment concentration data was derived from 
(http://reason.gsfc.nasa.gov/OPS/Giovanni/ocean.seawifs.shtm) SeaWiFS 
global 9-km monthly imagery.  
 
3. Results 
 
3.1 Fall intermonsoon 2002 
 
3.1.1. Thermohaline structure 
   Thermal structure along the central Bay transect showed a shallow upper 
isothermal layer of about 20 m thickness in the south, which deepened to 
about 70 m at 11oN and then shoaled towards the north (Fig.2a). The 
temperature of this layer was about 28oC except in the northernmost regions 
(18-20oN), where it was 1oC higher. The thermocline was characterized by 
oscillations and exhibited a gradual shoaling towards north. Three regions 
could be identified with well defined upward sloping followed by downward 
sloping centered at 8oN, 14oN and 18oN. For example, the 22oC isotherm 
showed a 30-m shoaling in all the three regions from about 100 m to 70 m at 
8oN, 110 m to 80 m at 14oN, and 90 m to 60 m at 18oN. In general, the 
up/down sloping depressed the ambient temperature by about 3oC in all three 
regions.  It may be noted that the influence of the up/down sloping was 
discernible even in the upper 50 m in the case of oscillations centered at 8oN 
and 18oN, while that at 14oN was confined mostly below 80 m. Below 300 
m, however, the oscillations in the isotherms were very small. 
   The vertical salinity structure showed the presence of very low salinity 
waters in the surface, as low as 29, in the northern region (Fig.2b). The 
surface salinity increased rapidly towards the south attaining the maximum 
 7
value of 34. The salinity front arising from the freshening of waters from the 
north was confined mainly to the upper 50 m and north of 12oN.  As a result, 
salinity distribution also showed a strong vertical gradient with an increase 
in salinity of about 5.5 in the upper 50 m. The vertical gradient weakened 
towards the south with an increase in salinity of 1 in the upper 80 m.  Below 
50 m and down to 1000 m the salinity remained almost same. The up/down 
sloping of isohalines, though weakly perceptible in the region of 17-18oN, 
was absent near 8oN and 14oN. This was due to the weak salinity gradient 
towards the south and below 80 m.  
   The density (sigma-t) distribution essentially reflected 3 prominent regions 
of isopycnal doming (Fig.2c) coinciding with those seen in the thermal 
structure, apart from the strong density stratification in the north associated 
with the salinity gradient. 
   Along the western boundary, the thermal structure exhibited a warmer (in 
excess of 30oC) and shallower (~10 m) isothermal layer except in the south 
and north where it was colder (~29oC) and thicker (in excess of 20 m) 
(Fig.3a).  The most distinct features were two prominent regions of upward 
isotherm sloping followed by a downward sloping located at 12oN and 18oN, 
respectively (Fig.3a). The doming of isotherms was more pronounced at 
18oN with the 22oC isotherm showing a vertical displacement of 50 m from 
110 m to 60 m, while that at 12oN shoaled by about 30 m. This 
upward/downward sloping of isotherms lowered the temperature by about 
3oC at 12oN and 5oC at 18oN. Unlike the central Bay of Bengal thermal 
structure, the oscillation of isotherms at 12oN penetrated deeper than the 
thermocline and was noticed even down to 900 m.  
   The surface salinity showed fresher waters in the north compared to the 
central Bay with salinity as low as 25 (Fig.3b). The salinity structure 
 8
remained more or less similar to that of the central Bay, but with much 
stronger vertical gradients. However, the upward/downward sloping of 
isohalines was much sharper and more pronounced at 18oN in comparison 
with the central Bay. At 12oN the isohaline below 500 m also showed 
upward/downward sloping.  
   Once again the density (sigma-t) structure showed features similar to that 
of the thermal structure along with very strong stratification of the upper 
layers in the north (Fig.3c).  
 
3.1.2. Geostrophic currents 
   The geostrophic velocities computed from temperature and salinity 
profiles showed alternate bands of positive (eastward) and negative 
(westward) flows along both transects (Fig.4). Along the central Bay 
transect the flow was eastward between 7 and 8oN with a speed of 20 cm/s at 
8oN, which decreased towards 9oN and turned into a westward flow with 
maximum speed of 25 cm/s at 11oN (Fig.4a).  Once again, the flow was 
eastward between 12o and 14oN with maximum speed of 25 cm/s. Currents, 
in general, were weak (~5 cm/s) and westward north of 15oN, except for a 
region between 16o and 18oN where a weak (10 cm/s) and shallow (~70 m) 
eastward flow was encountered. It may be noted that the flows with speed 
greater than 10 cm/s were confined to the upper 150 m. 
   Along the western boundary (Fig.4b), the flow was eastward at 11°N with 
a speed of 20 cm/s, which gradually decreased to a minimum at 12°N and 
turned to a westward flow of magnitude 20 cm/s centered 13°N.  The current 
changed its direction towards the east at 16°N with speed increasing to ~20 
cm/s between 16 and 17oN followed by another change in direction towards 
the west. The maximum speed of this westward current was about 25 cm/s 
 9
between 18 and 19°N.  Here again, the flows with speed greater than 10 
cm/s were confined to 150 m, except between 11o and 13oN. 
   In general, the computed geostrophic flow reversals were associated with 
the upward/downward sloping of isotherms/isopycnals observed in the 
thermohaline structure. The eastward flow corresponds to the region of 
upward sloping while the westward flow coincides with downward sloping 
of isotherms/isopycnals. Thus, the alternating zonal flows associated with 
the doming of isopleths in the thermohaline structure appear to be a part of 
the cyclonic circulation feature and we infer them to be the signature of a 
cold-core eddy. In order to establish this, we analyzed the 7-day sea-level 
anomaly maps during 18 September to 15 October 2002 (Fig.5). Note that 
the CTD measurements along the central Bay transect were during 17 to 27 
September 2002, while those along the western boundary were during 30 
September to 11 October 2002. Hence the left panel in Fig.5 represents sea-
level anomaly during the central Bay transect sampling period, while that in 
the right panel represents the sea-level anomaly during the sampling period 
along western boundary. 
   In the sea-level anomaly maps, we noticed two cyclonic eddies in the north 
centered at 17oN, 88oE and 17.5oN, 85oE, embedded in a large cyclonic 
circulation between 84o and 89oE longitude and 14o and 19oN latitude 
(Fig.5). This was consistent with the geostrophic flow computed from the 
hydrographic data, which showed a large cyclonic circulation with eastward 
flow between 12o and 14oN and a westward flow north of it extending up to 
19oN. Note that in situ measurements sampled both eddies, one along the 
central Bay transect and the other along the western boundary track, away 
from its center. Similarly, two more cyclonic eddies – one centered at 12oN, 
82oE near the western boundary and the other at 8.5oN, 87oE in the central 
 10
Bay transect – were visible in the sea-level anomaly maps. These eddies 
depressed the sea level by about 20-25 cm. The sea-level anomaly map 
showed that the CTD station at 14oN along the central Bay transect falls at 
the edge of the large cyclonic circulation within which the two northern 
cyclonic eddies – central Bay and along the western boundary – were 
embedded (Fig.5). Thus, it is evident from the sea-level anomaly maps that 
there were only 4 distinct cyclonic eddies, two each along the open ocean 
and along western boundary, which were sampled during fall intermonsoon 
2002.  
 
3.1.3. Nutrients 
   Consistent with thermal structure, the vertical distributions of nitrate along 
the central Bay transect also showed oscillations and a general northward 
shoaling of isopleths in the upper ocean (Fig.6a).  The doming of isopleths 
centered at 8oN, 14oN, and 18oN, in general, coincided with the locations of 
eddies identified from the thermohaline structure as well as from the sea-
level anomaly maps, except that at 14oN, which was located at the edge of a 
large cyclonic circulation. The upper 20 m, however, showed concentrations 
below detection level; the 1 µM nitrate isopleth, which was generally located 
close to 50 m, shoaled to about 25 m in the south (south of 15oN) under the 
influence of the doming while in the north it shoaled to shallower than 10 m.  
Silicate showed a distribution similar to that of nitrate below 30 m (Fig.6b). 
However, unlike the nitrate the silicate levels were high in the upper 30 m. 
The surface silicate concentrations increased from 0.5 µM in the south to 2 
µM in the north.  
 11
   Along the western margin, the prominent features in the nitrate distribution 
were two regions of doming isopleths, centered at 12oN and 17.5oN (Fig.6c), 
which coincided with the locations of eddies inferred from the thermohaline 
structure and the sea-level anomaly maps. The top 20 m was devoid of 
nitrate except in the north and south where the doming introduced nitrate to 
shallower than 10 m. In fact, the 1-µM nitrate isopleth was deepest at 16oN 
and shoaled under the influence of eddies. Silicate also showed a distribution 
similar to that of nitrate below 20 m (Fig.6d). In the upper 20 m, unlike the 
nitrate pattern, high silicate levels were encountered towards the north with 
surface concentrations increasing from 5 µM at 17oN to 15 µM at 19oN. This 
high surface concentration, which decreased rapidly in the upper 30 m, 
suggests a source in the north. 
 
3.1.4. Chlorophyll a and primary productivity 
   Chlorophyll a in the top 120 m along the central Bay transect varied from 
0.12 mg/m3 to 0.37 mg/m3, with higher values towards south (Fig.7a). The 
most prominent feature was the occurrence of enhanced chlorophyll a 
concentrations, which coincided with the location of eddies inferred from the 
thermohaline structure and sea-level anomaly maps. In fact, the top 40 m of 
the water column in the eddy region contained the highest chlorophyll 
concentrations. The subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM), which was 
generally located at 60 m, shoaled under the influence of the eddy. As a 
result, very low chlorophyll a concentrations (<0.05 mg/m3), which occurred 
below 80 m in the south (south of 15oN), also shoaled (~ 60 m) towards the 
north. Surface primary production (PP) varied from 5.34 to 17.66 mg C m-3 
d-1, while column integrated PP (up to 120) ranged from 513 to 182 mg C m-
 12
2 d-1 (Table 1). Here again, the higher values of PP, both surface and column 
integrated, occurred in the eddy region, except at 18oN. 
   Along the western boundary surface chlorophyll a concentrations varied 
marginally from 0.13 to 0.18 mg/m3 except at 19oN and at 16oN where the 
highest (0.77 mg/m3) and lowest (0.08 mg/m3) values occurred respectively 
(Fig.7b).  Though enhanced chlorophyll concentrations were seen in the 
eddy region, unlike the open ocean, the concentrations were more prominent 
and uniformly distributed in the north (in the vicinity of 18oN) than the 
south. This is also reflected in the surface and column-integrated PP.  
Surface PP varied from 3.16 to 45.15 mg C m-3 d-1, while the column-
integrated values ranged from 196 to 350 mg C m-2 d-1. Though the eddy 
caused the nitracline to shoal both in the north and in the south along the 
central Bay, the column-integrated PP was highest in the south, more than 
2½ times that in the north. In fact, it was also 1½ times higher than the 
highest PP in the north along the western boundary.  
 
3.2 Spring intermonsoon 2003 
 
3.2.1 Thermohaline structure 
   Thermal structure along the central Bay transect during spring 
intermonsoon showed a thin isothermal layer of about 10 m in the south, 
south of 15oN, within which the temperature was in excess of 30oC (Fig.8a). 
Towards the north, the isothermal layer was thicker (~30 m) and 1oC colder. 
In general, the isotherms in the upper 50 m showed a shoaling trend from 
7oN to 15oN, while further north it deepend towards 17oN and once again 
shoaled at 19oN. However, below 50 m there was a reversal in the slope of 
the isotherms, which showed a deepening trend from 7oN towards 18oN. As 
 13
during the fall intermonsoon, we noticed oscillations in the thermocline and 
three distinct regions of isotherm upward sloping followed by downward 
sloping centered at 11oN, 16oN and 19oN. At 11oN, the upward/downward 
sloping of isotherms was the least, while at 19oN it was at a maximum. For 
example, the 22oC isotherm shoaled by about 20 m at 11oN and 16oN, which 
depressed the temperature at 120 m by 2-3oC. At 19oN the shoaling 
exhibited by the 22oC isotherm was as large as 70 m, which resulted in a 
drop in the temperature by about 7oC at 120 m. The upward/downward 
sloping of isotherms centered at 16oN was seen even at greater depths.  
   The vertical salinity structure showed an isohaline layer of about 30 m 
thickness having a salinity of about 33, except between 16o and 17oN, and 
south of 9oN (Fig.8b). In the former, salinity was 0.5 fresher, while in the 
latter salinity showed a steady increase. The halocline was located between 
30 and 100 m depth, within which salinity increased north of 9oN by 1.5. In 
the south, however, the gradient in the vertical salinity showed a steady 
decrease. Below 100 m salinity showed only small variation. The isohalines 
in the upper 100 m showed upward/downward sloping centered at 11oN, 
16oN and 19oN.  
   The density (sigma-t) structure, in general, showed a weaker stratification 
in the upper 50 m with a thicker isopycnal layer north of 14oN compared to 
south (Fig.8c). The pycnocline was confined between 50 and 200 m, within 
which there was marked upward/downward sloping of isopycnals centered at 
11o, 16o, and 19oN. Consistent with temperature and salinity structures, the 
vertical displacements of isopycnals were largest centered at 19oN.  
   Along the western margin the thermal structure showed a comparatively 
deep isothermal layer south of 16oN with a thickness of about 40 m and 
temperature in excess of 30oC (Fig. 9a). Towards the north the isothermal 
 14
layer was thin, about 10 m, and the temperature of this layer was about 1oC 
colder. In general, the isotherms in the upper thermocline showed a 
northward shoaling with the 29oC isotherm located at about 70 m deep in the 
south, which shoaled to about 10 m in the north. The most prominent feature 
was the upward/downward sloping of isotherms centered at 14oN and 
17.5oN, the latter being the most pronounced. The amplitude of isotherm 
displacement, though seen towards the deeper layers in both the cases, was 
greater at14oN. For example, at 14oN, the 22oC isotherm shoaled by about 30 
m, while at 17.5oN it shoaled by about 70 m. In contrast, in the deeper layers 
the 10oC isotherm showed a shoaling of about 140 m, whereas it shoaled 
only by 40 m at 17.5oN. The vertical displacement of isotherms at 100 m 
resulted in a depressing of the temperature by about 3oC at 14oN and by 
about and 5oC at 17.5oN. 
   The vertical salinity structure also showed a gradual shoaling of isohalines 
from south towards north in the upper 100 m, with surface waters north of 
15oN fresher by 0.5 (Fig.9b). Accordingly, the vertical gradient of salinity in 
the upper 100 m was only 0.5 in the south, but it was 1 in the north. 
Consistent with the thermal structure, salinity distribution showed prominent 
isohaline displacements centered at 14oN and 17.5oN.  
   The density (sigma-t) distribution essentially reflected the features in 
thermohaline structure (Fig.9c). 
 
3.2.2. Geostrophic currents 
   The geostrophic velocities computed from the hydrographic data during 
spring intermonsoon also showed alternate bands of positive (eastward) and 
negative (westward) flows along both the central Bay and the western 
boundary transects (Fig.10). Along the central Bay transect flow was 
 15
westward from 7oN to 13oN, except for a weak (~10 cm/s) and shallow 
eastward flow centered at 10.5oN (Fig.10a). The maximum westward flow of 
25 cm/s was encountered at 12oN. The westward flow reverses to eastward 
flow from 13oN to 16oN and had an average speed of about 10 cm/s. Once 
again the flow reverses to westward between 16o and 18oN and then to an 
eastward flow north of 18oN. In general, the strongest flow was encountered 
north of 16oN with the core of the westward flow (speed 35 cm/s) centered 
at 17oN, while that of the eastward flow (speed 50 cm/s) was centered at 
19oN. 
   Along the western boundary, the flow was eastward south of 14oN with a 
maximum speed of 30 cm/s followed by a stronger but narrower westward 
flow between 14 and 15.5oN with peak speed of 40 cm/s (Fig.10b). Once 
again eastward and westward flows were encountered at the southern and 
northern side of 18oN respectively. The westward currents, however, were 
much weaker (~10 cm/s) in the latter case and confined to the upper 60 m. 
   Thus, the opposing flows and the doming-structure in the thermohaline 
distribution appear to be the signature of a cold-core eddy. To confirm this, 
we analyzed the 7-day sea-level anomaly maps during 16 April to 13 May 
2003. Since the CTD measurements along the central Bay track were carried 
out during 16 to 26 April 2003, the left panel in Fig. 12 represents conditions 
that prevailed in the central Bay sampling period, while the right panel 
represents the conditions during the sampling along western boundary, 
which was from 27 April to 5 May 2003.  The sea-level anomaly picture 
showed the presence of three cyclonic eddies along the central Bay transect 
centered at 11oN, 90oE, 16oN, 89oE, and 19oN, 90oE (Fig.11a). The cyclonic 
eddy in the north (centered at 19oN, 90oE) was the most intense one, with a 
negative sea-level anomaly of about 22 cm, followed by the one centered at 
 16
16oN, 89oE, with a negative sea-level anomaly of 18 cm. The southern one 
(centered at 11oN, 90oE) was the least intense, with a negative sea-level 
anomaly of 6 cm. None of the CTD stations sampled the eddy at its center. 
The eddy at 11oN was sampled far from its center causing its signature by 
way of upward/downward sloping of isopleths in the thermohaline structure 
(Fig.8) to be the least. Note the presence of an anticyclonic eddy at 18oN, 
87oE (Fig.11a), the effect of which is seen as the steep dip in the isotherms at 
18oN (Fig.8). Along the western boundary also we see two cyclonic eddies, 
centered at 14oN and 17.5oN, with negative sea-level anomalies of 22 and 18 
cm respectively (Fig.11b) which were sampled by CTD stations close to 
their centers. Thus, we find five cyclonic eddies, three close to the open-
ocean track and two along the western boundary, in the sea-level anomaly 
maps, which were sampled by the CTD stations during spring intermonsoon 
2003. 
 
3.2.3. Nutrients 
   Along the central Bay transect noticeable features of the vertical 
distribution of nitrate were that the concentrations in the upper 30 m below 
detection level and the oscillations within the nitracline (Fig.12a). Doming 
of isopleths was found prominently at 4 locations, centered   at 9oN, 12oN, 
15oN, and 19oN. This resulted in appreciable enhancement of nitrate in the 
upper 50 m at these locations. For example, the 1-µM isopleth, which was in 
general located below 50 m, shoaled to about 25 m in the north under the 
influence of doming. Though a similar pattern of isopleth doming was 
observed in the distribution of silicate (Fig.12b), the concentrations in the 
upper 50 m, unlike those of nitrate, did not vary much. This is primarily due 
to the greater ambient concentration in the upper 30 m of the water column, 
 17
which was in the range 1.5-2 µM. The region of isopleth doming generally 
coincided with that of isotherms (Fig.8a), except that centered at 9oN. 
However, from the sea-level anomaly map (Fig.11a) it can be seen that the 
CTD station at 9oN along the central Bay transect falls at the edge of a large 
cyclonic circulation feature at 2o-8oN and 84o-96oE, which encompasses two 
cyclonic eddies (not sampled by CTD stations).   
 
   Along the western margin a prominent feature of both nitrate (Fig.12c) and 
silicate (Fig.12d) distribution was doming of isopleths centered between 17 
and 18oN. Under the influence of this doming, the 1-µM nitrate and 2-µM 
silicate isopleths, which were generally located at about 60 m depth, shoaled 
to shallower than 10 m and 20 m respectively (Fig.12c & d). A minor 
doming was centered at 14oN, in both the nitrate and the silicate distribution 
(Fig.12). As in the case of the central Bay, the nitrate levels in the upper 30 
m were below detection except in the region of doming (Fig.12c). The 
silicate levels in the upper 30 m varied from 1.5 to 2 µM (Fig.12d). 
 
3.2.4. Chlorophyll a and primary productivity 
   Along the central Bay transect, the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a in 
the top 120 m showed that the surface concentration varied from 0.06  to 
0.12 mg/m3 (Fig.7c). The most prominent features were the subsurface 
chlorophyll maximum (SCM) and enhanced chlorophyll a concentrations 
between 18o and 20oN. The SCM was generally located between 60 m and 
80 m, depth where concentrations were in excess of 0.25 mg/m3. Under the 
influence of the eddy between 18o and 20oN not only is the SCM pushed 
upward but also the chlorophyll concentrations within increase to 0.65 
mg/m3. Surface primary production (PP) varied from 0.01 to 3.97 mg C m-3 
 18
d-1, while column-integrated PP (to 120 m) ranged from 155 to 427 mg C m-
2 d-1 (Table 1). The higher value of column-integrated PP occurred in the 
eddy region in the north, where it was twotimes higher than it was in the 
non-eddy region. 
   Along the western boundary, surface chlorophyll a varied from 0.06 to 
0.21 mg/m3 and was, in general, higher than the open ocean values. But as in 
the case of the central Bay, the higher values were encountered towards the 
north (Fig. 7d). Here again we see enhanced chlorophyll a concentrations of 
about 0.6 mg/m3 under the influence of the eddy near 17oN. Surface PP 
varied from 1.87 to 9.68 mg C m-3 d-1 and column-integrated PP from 250 to 
469 mg C m-2 d-1 (Table 1).  
 
4. Discussion and conclusion 
 
   The thermohaline structures obtained from the in situ hydrographic 
measurements clearly indicated the presence of cyclonic eddies by way of 
doming isopleths/thermocline oscillation, both in the open Bay of Bengal 
and along the western boundary during both fall (2002) and spring (2003) 
intermonsoons. The spatial dimension of the thermocline oscillations 
associated with eddy ranged from 200 to 300 km, which means that at the 
most 3 stations sampled the eddy region.  The rotary flows associated with 
these eddies were seen as alternate bands of reversing zonal currents in the 
geostrophic computations.  In fact, the currents showed cyclonic circulation 
with eastward flow in the region of upward sloping isopleths and westward 
flow coinciding with downward sloping isopleths. Satellite-derived sea-level 
anomaly maps showed 4 distinct cyclonic eddies, 2 each along the central 
Bay and along western boundary respectively, during fall intermonsoon 
 19
2002 and 5 cyclonic eddies during spring intermonsoon, of which 3 were 
along the central Bay transect and 2 along the western boundary. The sea-
level anomaly maps revealed that the eddy generated during the spring 
intermonsoon had a life span of about 5 months, while that during the fall 
intermonsoon was short lived.  
   In the fall intermonsoon, these eddies depressed the ambient temperature 
by about 3oC in the upper 120 m in all the cases except at 18oN along the 
western boundary, where the temperature drop was about 5oC. To explore 
the reason for such differential cooling, we computed the static stability 
parameter (E) (Pond and Pickard, 1978) during fall intermonsoon. A 
comparison of the profiles at 18oN, 84.5oE and 14oN, 88oE (Fig.13a) clearly 
showed that though the water column in the upper 40 m at 18oN was much 
more strongly stratified than that at 14oN, below this depth and down to 160 
m the water column at 18oN was much less stable, which helped the cyclonic 
eddy at this location to pump more cold water to the top layers. However, 
the low-salinity surface waters, especially in the north, induced a strong 
halocline in the upper 50 m of the water column. The observed very low 
surface salinity of 29 in the open Bay and 25 near the western boundary in 
the north indicated the strong influence of fresh water flux due to the large 
E-P, which is in excess of 200 mm/month during June to August (see Fig.9 
of Narvekar and Prasanna Kumar, 2006). In addition to the oceanic 
precipitation there is also a large amount of freshwater input from peninsular 
rivers.  The monthly mean climatology of river discharge of the 6 major 
rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra, Irrawady, Godavari Krishna, and Cauvery, 
obtained from Global Runoff Data Center, Germany 
(http://grdc.bafg.de/servlet/is/2781/), showed that the freshwater discharge 
dominated during July to October (Fig.14a). The cumulative discharge of 
 20
these 6 rivers during this period (Fig.14b) amounted to a voluminous 3.46 x 
1012 m3. Note that the precipitation peaks in July (Fig.9 of Narvekar and 
Prasanna Kumar, 2006), while the river discharge peaks in August (Fig.14a). 
So there is a time lag between the precipitation and the freshwater discharge 
peaks.  
   Thus, though the cyclonic circulation associated with the eddy is capable 
of pumping cold subsurface waters towards surface as seen from the doming 
isopleths, the strong stratification associated with the low-salinity waters 
inhibited the shoaling of isopleths to the surface, thereby capping the eddy 
signature below 20 m from the surface.    
   In the spring intermonsoon also these eddies depressed the temperature by 
3oC at 120 m in all the cases except at 19oN in the central Bay and 17.5oN 
along the western boundary, where the cooling was 7oC and 5oC, 
respectively. Here again, the stability profiles showed that at 19oN, where 
the cooling was the highest, the water column below 80 m depth was much 
less stable compared to other eddy locations, for example at 14oN (Fig.13b). 
But unlike the fall intermonsoon, surface salinity during spring 
intermonsoon was much higher, with lowest values of 32.5 along the central 
Bay and 33 along the western boundary towards the north. This high surface 
salinity arises from positive E-P, which is in excess of 40 mm/month (Fig.9 
of Narvekar and Prasanna Kumar, 2006) coupled with marginal river 
discharge during spring intermonsoon (Fig.14a). SST during spring 
intermonsoon along the central Bay transect was 1oC warmer in the north, 
but towards the south it was 2oC warmer.  However, along the western 
boundary SST remained similar in both seasons. Though the warm SST in 
spring intermonsoon is capable of stratifying the upper ocean, the higher 
surface salinity in spring than in fall intermonsoon could counteract this, as 
 21
can be seen from the stability profiles (note the break in scale during fall 
intermonsoon).  
   As mentioned earlier, these cold-core eddies are capable of pumping 
subsurface waters to the upper layers. Eddy-pumping could cause an upward 
displacement of the nutricline along constant density surfaces and inject 
growth-limiting macro- (such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate) and micro- 
(such as iron) nutrients to an impoverished euphotic zone (Falkowski et al., 
1991; Olaizola et al., 1993; McGillicuddy and Robinson, 1997; 
McGillicuddy et al., 1998; Seki et al., 2001).  If there is enough sunlight this 
will lead to enhanced rates of biological productivity and export out of the 
euphotic zone. We see enhanced levels of nitrate and silicate during both fall 
and spring intermonsoons in the region of eddies. The observed co-located 
high concentrations of chlorophyll a during fall and spring intermonsoons 
are the response of nutrient injection into the euphotic zone by these eddies. 
Eddy-pumping of nutrients increased the chlorophyll a concentrations to 
more than 1½ times. Another effect of eddy pumping is that the subsurface 
chlorophyll maximum (SCM), which is generally located between 40 and 70 
m, is pushed upward. In fact, in spring intermonsoon SCM is even deeper, 
between 60 and 90 m, and the eddy-pumping not only shallows the SCM but 
increases the chlorophyll a in the SCM to more than double. In an earlier 
study Murty et al. (2000) reported the depth of the SCM in the open-sea 
region of the Bay of Bengal between 50 and 100 m based on May-June 1996 
measurements. However, their chlorophyll a concentrations were extremely 
low compared to earlier measurements (Radhakrishna et al., 1982, Devassy 
et al., 1983; Sarma and Kumar, 1991; Prasanna Kumar et al., 2002; 
Madhupratap et al., 2003), especially in the SCM, where they were ~0.1 
mg/m3. 
 22
   Apart from the nutrient enhancement in the eddy region, we also note 
enhancement of nitrate and silicate in the surface layer along the western 
boundary during fall intermonsoon towards 20oN and 11oN (see 0.5- and 
1.5-µM contours in Fig.6 c & d respectively). In the case of silicate the 
surface concentrations in the north were as high as 15 µM. This indicated 
that the nutrient source in the north must be the river input.  As the river 
discharge peaks during August (Fig.14a), it is quite likely that the surface 
enhancement of nutrients brought by river influx will be felt in the fall 
intermonsoon. Since the surface circulation at this time of the year is 
southward from the head of the Bay along the western boundary (Fig.5), 
there are more chances for the nutrients brought by the river input to be 
advected along the western boundary than in the offshore region.  Hence, we 
see this signal as enhanced nutrients in the northern part of the western 
boundary rather than in the northern part of the open-ocean transect. 
Consistent with this the chlorophyll a in the upper 30 m in northern part of 
the western boundary was 0.4 mg/m3, while it was only 0.15 mg/m3 in the 
northern part of the open-ocean transect. Again, in the south (11oN) the 
runoff from southern rivers could explain the enhanced levels of nutrients 
and associated elevated chlorophyll.   
   Eddies enhanced the biological productivity by more than 1½ times during 
both fall and spring intermonsoons. Interestingly, during fall intermonsoon 
the column-integrated biological productivity in the north was about 2½ 
times less than that in the south along the open ocean transect. In contrast, 
along the western boundary the northern part was about 1½ times more 
productive than the south.  This low biological productivity in the north 
along the central Bay transect, in spite of nutrient availability in the upper 
water column, points to the possibility of light limitation due to the 
 23
suspended sediment load brought in by the river runoff. Along the northern 
part of the western boundary, however, the quantity of nutrient in the surface 
layer is more than that in the northern part of the open-ocean transect. Note 
that along the western boundary the surface productivity in the north is more 
than 7 times that in the south (Table 1). Hence, though there could be light 
limitation in the northern part of the western boundary, comparatively high 
nutrient levels in the upper layer leads to an overall high productivity in 
comparison to the south.  During spring intermonsoon, however, the 
enhanced biological productivity is entirely controlled by eddy-pumping of 
nutrients to the euphotic zone. 
    It is now evident that cyclonic eddies exist and enhance biological 
productivity of the Bay of Bengal, not only in summer monsoon (Prasanna 
Kumar et al., 2004) but also in fall and spring intermonsoons. Though the 
surface chlorophyll concentrations as detected by satellite remote sensing 
may be perennially low, these cyclonic eddies, which appear to be 
ubiquitous in the Bay of Bengal, enhance biological productivity by 1½-2 
times its ambient value through eddy-pumping of nutrients. This has an 
overall implication for the basin-wide new production and export flux. The 
comparable rates of the annual fluxes of organic carbon between the high-
productivity Arabian Sea and what has traditionally been considered to be 
the low-productivity Bay of Bengal could be, at least in part, explained by 
enhancement of biological productivity in the Bay of Bengal by cyclonic 
eddies. However, we need more eddy-targeted measurements and modeling 
efforts to quantify the impact of the eddies on the biological pump in the 
Bay of Bengal.

western Bay of Bengal during fall (14 September – 12 October, 2002) and spring 
(12 April – 7 May, 2003) intermonsoons overlying on the annual mean surface 
salinity  distribution (Levitus et al., 1994). Dark circles (●) indicate 1-degree CTD 
stations while hollow circles () are the biological stations for in-situ incubation 
for primary production.  Rivers Ganges-Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery 
and Irrawady are also shown. Depth contours are in meters.

Note that the PP measurements along the central Bay (88oE) during fall 
intermonsoon were at18oN while those during spring intermonsoon were at 
17oN. * The unusually low surface PP is inexplicable. However, at 10 m 
depth it was 2.88 mg C m-2 d-1 though the chlorophyll a was around 0.06 mg 
m-3 at both depths.  Mean±SE (standard error) was calculated using 14C 
counts (disintegration per minute; dpm) of 3 light-bottles (triplicate sample). 
The dark bottle dpm was subtracted from each light-bottle dpm before 
calculating the mean±SE.
