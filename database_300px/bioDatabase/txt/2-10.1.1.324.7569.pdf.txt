Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to improve early detection and
advances in chemotherapy, metastatic relapses remain a
major challenge in the management of ovarian cancer. The
endothelin A receptor (ETAR)/endothelin-1 (ET-1) axis has
been shown to have a significant role in ovarian carcinoma by
promoting tumorigenesis. Here we show that the ET-1/ETAR
autocrine pathway drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transi-
tion (EMT) in ovarian tumor cells by inducing a fibroblastoid
and invasive phenotype, down-regulation of E-cadherin,
increased levels of B-catenin, Snail , and other mesenchymal
markers, and suppression of E-cadherin promoter activity.
Activation of ETAR by ET-1 triggers an integrin-linked kinase
(ILK)–mediated signaling pathway leading to glycogen syn-
thase kinase-3B (GSK-3B) inhibition, Snail and B-catenin
stabilization, and regulation of transcriptional programs that
control EMT. Transfection of dominant negative ILK or
exposure to an ILK inhibitor suppresses the ET-1-induced
phosphorylation of GSK-3B as well as Snail and B-catenin
protein stability, activity, and invasiveness, indicating that ET-1/
ETAR–induced EMT-promoting effects depend on ILK. ETAR
blockade by specific antagonists or reduction by ETAR RNA
interference reverses EMT and cell invasion by inhibiting
autocrine signaling pathways. In ovarian carcinoma xeno-
grafts, ABT-627, a specific ETAR antagonist, suppresses
EMT determinants and tumor growth. In human ovarian
cancers, ETAR expression is associated with E-cadherin down-
regulation, N-cadherin expression, and tumor grade. Collec-
tively, these findings provide evidence of a critical role for
the ET-1/ETAR axis during distinct steps of ovarian carcinoma
progression and identify novel targets of therapeutic inter-
vention. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(24): 11649-57)
Introduction
Ovarian cancer, the leading cause of death from gynecologic
malignancies, is a highly metastatic disease characterized by
widespread peritoneal dissemination and ascites (1). Because
treatment of patients in advanced stages is still penalized by low
survival rates, the development of new treatment protocols
depends on improved knowledge of the molecular mechanisms
controlling metastasis. The endothelin (ET) family is composed of
three isopeptides, ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3, which act through two
distinct subtypes of G-protein coupled receptors (i.e., ETA and ETB).
The ETA receptor (ETAR) is highly specific for ET-1 whereas ETBR
binds ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 with the same affinity (2). ET-1 has been
implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide range of human
tumors (3), including ovarian carcinoma (4, 5). ET-1 and the ETAR
are overexpressed in primary and metastatic ovarian carcinomas
and ET-1 is present at high levels in ovarian tumor ascites (5, 6). In
ovarian tumor cells, ET-1 acts as an autocrine growth, survival, and
angiogenic factor selectively through the ETAR (4, 6–9), activating
diverse signaling pathways (10); these include mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase–dependent Akt
activation, src-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor trans-
activation (9), which is partly responsible for MAPK phosphoryla-
tion (11), and p125 focal adhesion kinase and paxillin activation,
which are thought to transduce signals involved in tumor cell
invasion (10). Thus, ET-1, acting through ETAR, consistently
induces the activity of multiple metastasis-related proteinases,
such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and the urokinase-type
plasminogen activator system (12). Moreover, ET-1 inhibits gap
junction intercellular communication by inducing phosphorylation
of connexin 43, allowing tumor cells to escape growth control and
invasion (13).
In epithelial cancer, acquisition of invasiveness is often
accompanied by loss of the epithelial features and gain of a mesen-
chymal phenotype, a process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT).
A primary event that governs EMT is the disruption of the
E-cadherin-mediated stable interactions between the cells (14–18).
Normal cells of ovarian surface epithelium express little or no
E-cadherin. Although many primary ovarian carcinomas express
E-cadherin, its expression is reduced in many advanced carcino-
mas, confirming the paradigm of EMT as an integral component of
the acquisition of the invasive phenotype (19, 20). Interestingly, a
recent study shows that E-cadherin expression was significantly
increased in the metastatic lesions compared with the respective
primary ovarian tumors (21), indicating that E-cadherin down-
regulation is a dynamic event that is required during the initial
invasion stage whereas the regrowth of the secondary tumor as
metastasis requires the reexpression of E-cadherin.
E-cadherin down-regulation can be accompanied by increased
expression of mesenchymal N-cadherin which promotes inappro-
priate survival signals and the malignant phenotype through
interactions with the stromal cells (22–25). Loss of E-cadherin gene
expression is mainly due to up-regulation of the transcription
factor Snail , a zinc finger protein that represses E-cadherin by
binding the E-boxes present in its promoter (15). Increased
expression of Snail has been correlated with loss of E-cadherin
expression in vitro (26, 27) and in vivo (28–31).

The intracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts with catenin
proteins, called a-, h- g-, and p120-catenin, to form the cytoplasmic
adhesion complex linked to actin filaments (22). Another
characteristic cellular event of EMT is an increase in the nuclear
amount of h-catenin. In addition to its pivotal role in cadherin-
based cell adhesion, h-catenin can act as a transcriptional activator
through its interaction with T-cell–specific transcription factor/
lymphoid enhancer factors (TCF/LEF). Activity of h-catenin/TCF
complex is essential for the transcription of genes that direct cell
fate, polarity, and proliferation of tumor cells (14). Cytosolic
h-catenin is normally phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-
3h (GSK-3h) at serine and threonine residues in its NH2-terminal
domain. This region is then recognized and ubiquitinated by a
multiprotein complex containing the F-box protein h-TrCP with
resultant degradation of the polyubiquitinated h-catenin by the
proteasome (17). Alternatively, the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway can inhibit the ability of GSK-3h to phosphorylate target
substrates, with resultant increases in h-catenin levels. The
stabilization of h-catenin consequently leads to enhanced nuclear
accumulation and its transcriptional activity through binding to
TCF/LEF complex (32). Different signaling pathways could stabilize
the pool of cytosolic h-catenin that is released from E-cadherin-
bound sites as a consequence of Snail-mediated E-cadherin
repression.
Recent findings support a model wherein GSK-3h activity also
controls Snail phosphorylation, h-TrCP-directed ubiquitination,
and proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, GSK-3h
inhibition induces stability and increased nuclear levels of Snail
protein. Moreover, a block of GSK-3h has been shown to increase
the transcription of Snail gene (33–37).
The integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a component of focal adhesion
plaques which interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domains of
h1-integrin subunits, has an essential role in EMT by connecting
the cell-adhesion molecules, integrins, and growth factors to the
actin cytoskeleton and to a range of signaling pathways.
Overexpression of ILK induces down-regulation of E-cadherin
expression, nuclear translocation of h-catenin, and activation of
h-catenin and Snail transcriptional activity (38–40). Expression of
ILK inhibits GSK-3h activity, indicating that GSK-3h is a substrate
of ILK (41). Consistent with the premise that GSK-3h regulates
Snail and h-catenin levels and transcriptional programs in a
cooperative fashion, we showed that activation of the ET-1/ETAR
pathway results in inhibition of GSK-3h through ILK. This stabilizes
Snail and h-catenin proteins which concordantly engage the
transcriptional activities that converge on the EMT process in
human ovarian cancer cells. A small-molecule ETAR antagonist,
ABT-627, suppresses EMT determinants and tumor growth in an
ovarian xenograft tumor model. These findings indicate that the
ETAR signaling is essential during distinct steps of tumor
progression by interfering with EMT process.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, HEY and OVCA 433,
were cultured as previously described (12). All culture reagents were from
Invitrogen (Paisley, Scotland, United Kingdom). Cells were cultured in
serum-free medium for 24 hours before ET-1 (100 nmol/L; Peninsula
Laboratories, Belmont, CA) stimulation. ETAR antagonists, ABT-627
(1 Amol/L; kindly provided by Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and
BQ 123 (1 Amol/L; Peninsula Laboratories), were added 15 minutes before
the agonist. Pretreatment with KP-392 (10 Amol/L; Quadra Logic
Technologies QLT, Vancouver, BC), MG132 (10 Amol/L), cycloheximide
(20 Amol/L; all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), or LiCl (40 mmol/L; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) was done for 30 to 60 minutes before the addition of ET-1.
ELISA. Subconfluent HEY cells were serum-starved for 24 hours and
incubated for the indicated times. ET-1 release was measured in triplicate
on microtiter plates by an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. ET-1 may be measured in
the range 0 to 120 pg/mL. The sensitivity is <1.0 pg/mL.
Immunoblotting. Mem-PER eukaryotic membrane protein extraction
reagent kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) was used for the
enrichment of membrane protein whereas NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic
extraction reagents (Pierce Biotechnology) were used to separate cyto-
plasmic and nuclear fractions. Total cell lysates, membrane, cytoplasmic,
or nuclear fractions, or homogenized HEY tumor specimens were subjected
to SDS-PAGE and processed by immunoblotting using antibodies to
E-cadherin, N-cadherin, h-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories, Heidel-
berg, Germany), phosphorylated GSK-3h (pGSK-3h), GSK-3h (Cell Signaling,
Beverly, NA), ILK (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), h-actin (Oncogene,
Darmstadt, Germany), ETAR (Abbott Laboratories), vimentin (DAKO,
Denmark), and Snail (12). The proteins were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) and quantified using
NIH image (Scion, Frederick, MD).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA from HEY cells was extracted
using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done
using AccessQuick RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer. The primers sets were as follows:
ETAR , 5V-CACTGGTTGGATGTGTAATC-3Vand 5V-GGAGATCAATGACCACA-
TAG-3V; GAPDH , 5V-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3V and 5V-TCCACCACC-
CTGTTGCTGTA-3V. Thirty-five cycles of amplification were done.
Northern blotting. Total RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane,
which was hybridized in the QuikHyb hybridization Solution (Stratagene,
La Jolla, CA). The cDNA probe was prepared using RT-PCR products by
SUPERSCRIPT One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 Ag of
RNA was reverse transcribed using the following primers: E-cadherin ,
5V-AACAGGATGGCTGAAGGTGA-3V and 5V-AAAATCCAAGCCCTTTGCTG-
3V; Snail , 5V-TTCCAGCAGCCCTACGACCAG-3V and 5V-GCCTTTCCCAC-
TAGTCTCATC-3V. Probes were labeled with [a-32P]dCTP using a random
primer oligolabeling kit (Amersham). The relative intensity of signals was
quantified using NIH image (Scion).
Luciferase reporter gene assay. To measure the transcriptional activity
of Snail , E-cadherin promoter, and h-catenin, 3  105 cells per well were
transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) with
0.5 Ag of pGL3-SNA (869/+59) vector containing luciferase (Luc) gene
under the control of the human Snail promoter (40), with 0.5 Ag
pGL2 Ecad3/luc construct (kindly provided by Dr. E.R. Fearon, University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), or with a plasmid containing three copies
of the TCF-4 binding site upstream a firefly luciferase reporter gene
(pTOP-Flash, Cell Signaling), respectively, or with empty control vectors
(Promega). Where indicated, HEY cells were transfected overnight with
1 Ag of ILK cDNA (kinase dead) in pUSEamp (E359K mutant) or with
empty vector (Upstate). All constructs were cotransfected with pCMV-h-
galactosidase plasmid (Promega). After 24 hours of transfection, serum-
starved cells were treated with ET-1 and/or inhibitors for additional
24 hours. Luciferase activity was determined in the cell lysates using the
Luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to h-galactosidase
activity. The mean of three independent experiments done in sextuplicate
was reported.
Small-interfering RNA treatment. HEY cells were transfected with 100
nmol/L small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes against ETAR mRNA
(SMART pool) or scrambled mock siRNA obtained commercially (Dharma-
con, Lafayette, CO). siRNA transfection using LipofectAMINE reagent
(Invitrogen) was done according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Cells
were harvested 48 hours later and ETAR mRNA and protein levels were
determined. In the luciferase assay, cells were transfected with 0.5 Ag of
pGL3-SNA vector or 0.5 Ag of pGL2 Ecad3/luc construct 24 hours after
being transfected with 100 nmol/L ETAR siRNA. Cells were then treated
with ET-1 (100 nmol/L) and harvested after 24 hours.

Immunohistochemistry. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining of tumor
xenografts was done on acetone-fixed 4-Am tissue sections as previously
described (43). E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and h-catenin expressions were
detected using antibodies described above with the Vector MOM
immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3-amino-
9-ethylcarbazole as chromogenic substrate and Mayer’s hematoxylin as
nuclear counterstain. Sections incubated with isotype-matched immuno-
globulins served as negative control.
Chemoinvasion assay. Chemoinvasion assay was done with a 48-well
modified Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe) and 8-Am pore size polyvinyl
pyrrolidone–free polycarbonate Nucleopore filters (Costar, New York, NY)
as previously described (12). The filters were coated with an even layer of
0.5 mg/mL Matrigel (BD Transduction Laboratories). The lower compart-
ment of the chamber was filled with ET-1 (100 nmol/L) and/or ABT-627
(1 Amol/L). Serum-starved HEY cells (5  105/mL) were placed in the upper
compartment (55 AL/well). BQ 123 and ABT-627 were previously added to
the cells and preincubated for 15 minutes at 37jC. In the chemoinvasion
assay using ETAR siRNA, HEY cells were transfected for 48 hours and then
incubated in the upper compartment. After 24 hours of incubation at 37jC,
the filters were removed, stained with Diff-Quick (Merz-Dade, Dudingen,
Switzerland), and the migrated cells in 10 high-power fields were counted.
Each experimental point was analyzed in triplicate.
Xenografts in nude mice. Female athymic (nu+/nu+) mice, 4 to 6 weeks
of age, were used (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The treatment
protocol followed the guidelines for animal experimentation of the Italian
Ministry of Health. Mice were injected s.c. into one flank with 1.5  106
viable HEY cells. After 7 days, when tumor reached f0.2 to 0.3 cm in
diameter, mice were randomized in two groups (n = 10) to receive different
treatments. One group was treated i.p. for 21 days with 2 mg/kg/d of ABT-
627. Control mice were injected with drug vehicle. On day 40 after tumor
injection, tumors were removed from control and treated mice and snap
frozen for immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis. Tumor size was
measured with calipers and was calculated using the formula p/6  larger
diameter  (smaller diameter)2.
Tissue samples. Immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian cancers was
done on archival from 50 tumors collected with informed consent as
indicated by our Institutional Review Board, which were classified
according to WHO criteria. Primary tumors include 36 serous and 14
endometrioid carcinomas. Avidin-biotin indirect immunoperoxidase stain-
ing was done as previously described (5) by using antibodies described
above and monoclonal antibody to ET-1 (clone TR.ET.48.5, Affinity
Bioreagents, Golden, CO). The avidin-biotin assays were done using the
Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories). 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole was
used as chromogenic substrate and Mayer’s hematoxylin as nuclear
counterstain.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using m2 test, Student’s
test, or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The time course of tumor growth
was compared across the groups with the use of two-way ANOVA with
group and time as variables (SPSS, Chicago, IL). All statistical tests were
two sided. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Endothelin-1/endothelin A receptor autocrine pathway is
required for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. ETAR over-
expression is often accompanied in ovarian tumor cells by
production of ET-1, and autocrine stimulation via ET-1 has been
implicated in tumor progression (4, 5). Because of the unknown
invasive responses elicited by ET-1, such as EMT, we first analyzed
cell plasticity (42) of the two human ovarian cancer cell lines, HEY
and OVCA 433, which release ET-1 and express functional ETAR (4).
The ET-1 levels released from HEY and OVCA 433 cells were within
the physiologically range needed for activation of ETAR in an

autocrine fashion (Fig. 1A). To test whether the interference with
ET-1/ETAR autocrine loop would affect EMT, we used two
pharmacologic antagonists of ETAR: BQ 123, a selective peptide
antagonist, and ABT-627, a small molecule that potently (K I = 34
pmol/L) and selectively inhibits ET-1 signaling at the level of
interaction with ETAR (43). In ovarian cancer primary cultures and
cell lines, ABT-627 and BQ 123 cause inhibition of spontaneous
growth rate. No inhibitory effect is observed in a cell line (C33A)
not expressing ETAR, further strengthening the specificity of these
ETAR antagonists. Moreover, addition of the ETBR antagonist BQ
788 does not affect the basal cell growth rate, showing that
endogenous ET-1 acts as an autocrine modulator of ovarian cancer
cells selectively through the ETAR (4, 5, 43). Sustained ETAR
signaling caused by an autocrine ET-1/ETAR loop can be required
for the maintenance of EMT in HEY cells as shown by a spindle-
shaped and motile fibroblastoid phenotype (Fig. 1B). Interestingly,
a large percentage of HEY cells reverted to an epithelial phenotype
in which the cells formed compact structures in the presence of
1 Amol/L ABT-627 for 48 hours (Fig. 1B). To determine whether
EMT-associated molecular alterations have occurred in these cells,
we examined the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal
markers by immunoblotting. Both ETAR antagonists reversed ET-
1-induced EMT, in association with repression of N-cadherin and
vimentin, and regained expression of endogenous E-cadherin and
h-catenin (Fig. 1C). To further verify the role of ETAR in regulating
EMT, we employed RNA interference (siRNA) technology, which

targets ETAR. Transfection with ETAR siRNA, but not with the
control scrambled siRNA, markedly reduced both ETAR mRNA and
protein levels (Fig. 1D). ETAR antagonists, as well as ETAR siRNA,
resulted in a significant decrease in the basal activity of HEY cells
and ET-1-induced cell invasion whereas the control siRNA was
ineffective (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that an
ET-1/ETAR autocrine loop in ovarian carcinoma cells has a critical
role in inducing EMT morphologic and molecular changes and cell
invasion.
Endothelin-1 induces transcriptional up-regulation of Snail.
Because the transcription factor Snail functions as a potent
repressor of E-cadherin, we examined whether ET-1 can regulate
Snail at multiple levels. In HEY cells, ET-1 up-regulates Snail mRNA
in a time-dependent manner. This effect was paralleled by the
down-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). In addition,
ET-1 induced a significant increase in the promoter activity of
Snail . The ability of the ETAR antagonist ABT-627 to block
ET-1-induced Snail promoter activity indicated that this effect is
mediated by the ETAR (Fig. 2B). Because Snail has been implicated
in repression of E-cadherin transcription, we analyzed the effect of
ET-1 on E-cadherin promoter activity. ET-1 treatment suppressed
the transcriptional activity of E-cadherin through ETAR as
indicated by the inhibitory effect of ABT-627 (Fig. 2C). Additionally,
HEY cells were transiently cotransfected with ETAR siRNA and
either Snail promoter or E-cadherin promoter. As shown in Fig. 2B
and C , transfection with ETAR siRNA, but not with control siRNA,
reverted the ET-1-induced suppression of E-cadherin promoter
and remarkably prevented that induced by endogenous ET-1. By
contrast, transfection with ETAR siRNA caused a decrease in both
basal and ET-1-induced Snail promoter activity, resulting in
E-cadherin down-regulation at the transcriptional level.
Endothelin-1 promotes B-catenin nuclear translocation
and B-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity. Upon Wnt-
dependent or Wnt-independent stimulation, h-catenin accumulates
in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus where it may asso-
ciate with the TCF/LEF, thereby activating target gene transcription
and biological responses (14, 15). To analyze the translocation of
h-catenin in response to activation of the ET-1/ETAR pathway, we
separated membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions of HEY
cells. ET-1 up-regulated the cytosolic and nuclear accumulation of

h-catenin, and both were prevented by ABT-627 (Fig. 2D). In HEY
and OVCA 433 cells, ET-1 treatment activated transcription of the
TCF/LEF reporter. This response was completely blocked by ABT-
627, pointing to ETA as the relevant receptor in these events (Fig. 2E).
Endothelin-1 induces Snail and B-catenin protein stability
and transcription through integrin-linked kinase–dependent
glycogen synthase kinase-3B inhibition. It has been shown that
EMT induced by overexpression of ILK is accompanied by down-
regulation of E-cadherin expression, activation of Snail gene
expression, and increased nuclear activity of h-catenin TCF/LEF
transcriptional complex (39, 44, 45). Moreover, ILK expression
increases during ovarian cancer progression and soluble factors in
ascitic fluid mediate sustained overexpression of ILK in ovarian
tumors (46). ILK expression was up-regulated in ET-1-treated cells
and this response was mediated by the ETAR as shown by the
blocking activity of ABT-627 (Fig. 3A).
ET-1 also promoted a significant increase in the Ser9-phosphor-
ylated GSK-3h (pGSK-3h) through ETAR as shown by abrogation of
this effect by ABT-627 (Fig. 3B). To establish that GSK-3h is a
downstream substrate of ILK in the signaling activated by ET-1/
ETAR, we blocked ILK activity by transfecting HEY cells with a
kinase-deficient, dominant negative form of ILK or with the small-
molecule inhibitor of ILK activity, KP-392 (44). Under these
conditions, ET-1 was unable to phosphorylate GSK-3h (Fig. 3B),
thus showing the critical role of ILK in GSK-3h inactivation
induced by the ET-1/ETAR axis.
The demonstration that GSK-3h inhibition promotes nuclear
localization and transcription of Snail , as well as Snail and
h-catenin protein stabilization, adds another level of complexity to
the regulation of EMT (34, 36). The proteasome inhibitor MG132,
the GSK-3h inhibitor LiCl, and ET-1 enhanced the expression of
Snail , h-catenin, and p-GSK-3h. These responses were increased in
cells pretreated in association with lithium or ET-1, indicating
that pGSK-3h and the proteasome pathway are involved in the
ET-1-induced regulation of Snail and h-catenin proteins (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, in HEY cells treated with cycloheximide, the half-
lives of Snail and h-catenin were prolonged in the presence of ET-1
and were similar to that observed following treatment of HEY cells
with the GSK-3h inhibitor LiCl (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig.
S1A and B). This further underscores for the first time that ET-1
acts through an ETAR-mediated pathway to stabilize Snail and
h-catenin proteins in promoting an EMT program through GSK-3h,
probably by inhibiting the h-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination of both
proteins. To establish the role of ILK in ET-1-induced Snail or
h-catenin stability, we silenced ILK activity by dominant negative
ILK and with KP-392. Under these conditions, ET-1 affected neither
Snail nor h-catenin stability (Fig. 3E). Moreover, KP-392 signifi-
cantly reduced ET-1-induced Snail and h-catenin/TCF/LEF tran-
scriptional activity and cell invasiveness (Fig. 3F-H). These
observations clearly place ILK at a crossroad of ET-1/ETAR
signaling to activate Snail- and h-catenin-driven transcriptional
programs that cooperatively support an invasive EMT process.
Endothelin A receptor antagonist–induced inhibition of
tumor growth in vivo is associated with a suppression of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition molecular determi-
nants. We next determined whether ETAR blockade resulted in
the inhibition of ET-1-induced EMT effectors and tumor growth
by treating mice bearing established HEY tumors with ABT-627.

Treatment with ABT-627 produced a 65% inhibition of HEY
tumor growth (Fig. 4A). ABT-627 was generally well tolerated
with no detectable signs of acute or delayed toxicity. Analysis of
EMT molecule expression in ovarian carcinoma xenografts
revealed a marked reduction of N-cadherin, Snail , pGSK-3h,
and ILK and an increase of E-cadherin and h-catenin expression
in ABT-627–treated mice compared with controls (Fig. 4B).
Immunohistochemical evaluation of tumors confirmed increased
expressions of E-cadherin and h-catenin and a concomitant
decrease of N-cadherin expression following ABT-627 treatment
(Fig. 4C).
E-cadherin is down-regulated in endothelin-1/endothelin A
receptor–expressing primary ovarian tumor tissues. To explore
the pathophysiologic function of ETAR in human ovarian cancer, a
cohort of 50 primary ovarian cancer tissues were stained by
immunohistochemistry for ETAR, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin
expression. Consistent with our observations in cell cultures and
HEY xenografts, expression of ETAR was significantly correlated
with the down-regulation of E-cadherin (P < 0.008) and with
enhanced expression of N-cadherin (P < 0.007; Fig. 5A and B). The
ETAR expression was grade dependent, with grade 3 and 4 cancers
showing higher levels than early-grade cancers (P < 0.01; Fig. 5B).
These results are consistent with our previous findings wherein the
expression of ETAR significantly correlates with neovascularization
(P < 0.0002) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
expression (6). The tumor-staining data indicate the biological
relevance of ETAR in the regulation of EMT in vivo , resulting in
down-regulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin and concomitant
up-regulation of N-cadherin.
Discussion
One hallmark of epithelial cancer progression is EMT in which
tumor cells undergo loss of polarity and cell-cell junctions and
acquire a mesenchymal phenotype and the ability to invade the
extracellular matrix and to migrate to distant sites (14, 47). In this
study, we provide ample evidence that in human ovarian
carcinoma cells, ETAR activation by ET-1 contributes to tumor
progression by acting as a crucial mediator of EMT. This
conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, ET-1
through the ETAR induces a spectrum of key events including
down-regulation of the epithelial adherens, such as E-cadherin and
h-catenin, induction of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin
and vimentin, and enhanced cell invasiveness. Second, ET-1/ETAR
regulates Snail and h-catenin, the major contributors to E-cadherin
suppression, at multiple levels. Thus, ET-1 increases both Snail and
h-catenin protein stability and transcriptional activity. Third, ILK is
a downstream check point of the signaling pathways activated by
ET-1/ETAR that, via GSK-3h inactivation, promotes Snail and
h-catenin signaling and acquisition of an invasive phenotype.
Fourth, interruption of ET-1/ETAR autocrine signaling by two
selective ETAR antagonists or by RNA interference reverts EMT,
increases the transcription level of E-cadherin, as well as inhibits
Snail transcription activity and basal cell invasion rate. Further-
more, pharmacologic blockade of ETAR inhibits tumor xenograft
growth and EMT molecular determinants. Finally, a significant
correlation between ETAR and E-cadherin down-regulation and
N-cadherin expression was observed in human ovarian cancer
tissues, indicating the relevant role of ETAR in the EMT process.
Loss of normal tissue architecture and microenvironmental
interactions are signatures of epithelial cancer progression (16).
Here we describe a mechanism whereby ET-1/ETAR signaling
orchestrates transcriptional programs that regulate E-cadherin
down-regulation, EMT, and progression to invasive and metastatic
ovarian carcinoma.
Recent data (34–36) show that inhibition of GSK-3h promotes
nuclear localization and transcription of Snail , as well as Snail and
h-catenin protein stabilization, revealing that many oncogenic
pathways could control cell adhesion, cell fate, and invasion during
metastasis. Consistent with these findings, we show that ET-1 acts
through ETAR-mediated pathway to stabilize Snail and h-catenin
proteins and activate a Snail- and h-catenin-driven transcriptional
program that regulates EMT determinants. Thus, phosphorylation
of GSK-3h by ET-1 resulting in the Snail and h-catenin stabilization
shows that inhibition of GSK-3h remains central to ET-1-induced
key hallmarks of EMT. These results were consistent with the
previous observation that ET-1 increases cytosolic h-catenin in

and E-cadherin and N-cadherin was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.

cardiomyocytes to a level equivalent to that induced by the GSK-3h
inhibitor (48).
In view of its position at the crossroads connecting integrins
and the actin cytoskeleton, ILK was hypothesized to be a
candidate signaling molecule that functions at the convergence
point of cell adhesion– and growth factor–triggered signal
transduction, thus regulating the EMT process (39). Here we
show that ET-1-driven ILK signaling is necessary for GSK-3h
phosphorylation and related Snail and h-catenin protein stability,
transcriptional activity, and invasion, implicating for the first time
ILK and its downstream substrate GSK-3h as check points of
finely tuned interconnected signals induced by ET-1/ETAR to
modulate EMT. Thus, we propose a complex scheme wherein
activation of ETAR pathway by ET-1 drives inhibition of GSK-3h by
an ILK-mediated signaling pathway to stabilize Snail and h-
catenin proteins in a coordinate fashion so as to cooperatively
engage transcriptional programs leading to EMT.
Because all the molecular effectors of EMT are triggered by ETAR
activation, blockade of this receptor results in inhibition of tumor
growth and progression of ovarian carcinoma xenografts. We also
show that ETAR blockade restores E-cadherin and h-catenin
expression and suppresses Snail , ILK, and N-cadherin expression
in vivo , further identifying the mechanisms through which the
autocrine ET-1/ETAR loop sustains EMT process and, in turn,
creates a tumor microenvironment more permissive to progression.
In this context, ET-1/ETAR induces the disruption of normal
host-tumor interactions regulating changes in cadherin, connexin,
and MMP expression (13, 43). Indeed, the immunohistochemical
and immunoblot analysis of HEY xenografts provides in vivo
evidence for this concept showing that treatment with ABT-627
induces a significant reduction of microvessel density, expression
of VEGF, cyclooxygenase-2, and MMP-2, and increased tumor
apoptosis and connexin 43–based gap junctional intercellular
plaques (9, 13, 43).
It is becoming increasingly clear that E-cadherin acts as a late-
stage microenvironmental tumor suppressor in ovarian carcinoma
(19, 20, 49). This observation was supported by the immunohisto-
chemical profile of cadherin phenotype in primary ovarian cancer
samples, indicating that expression of ET-1/ETAR axis correlates
with the switch of cadherin expression associated with advanced-
stage tumors. These findings complement and extend the recent
analysis of a genome-wide expression profile of late-stage ovarian
cancer whereby ET-1 has been identified as a key gene that activates
cell signaling controlling cell migration, spread, and invasion (50).
Although further studies are required to examine the complex
connection network that regulates EMT in tumor metastasis, a
scheme is emerging in which we identify for the first time that
mimicry of the Wnt pathway, through ETAR-driven molecular
events, is required for the cooperative regulation of Snail and
h-catenin signaling, which occurs via ILK and GSK-3h.
Understanding the regulatory loops that allow close coordina-
tion of EMT program may provide a novel strategies aimed at
preventing the development of metastasis. In this regard, the ability
of ETAR antagonists to induce concomitant suppression of tumor
cell proliferation and/or survival (7, 43) and simultaneously control
EMT provides a rationale for developing a more effective
therapeutic intervention in aggressive ovarian cancer.
