Abstract
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is widely used for treatment of advanced
colorectal cancer. However, it is common for such patients to
develop resistance to 5-FU, and this drug resistance becomes a
critical problem for chemotherapy. The mechanisms underly-
ing this resistance are largely unknown. To screen for proteins
possibly responsible for 5-FU resistance, cells resistant to 5-FU
were derived from human colon cancer cell lines and two-
dimensional gel electrophoresis–based comparative proteo-
mics was done. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis data
showed there was lower expression of the A subunit of
mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase (ATP synthase) in 5-FU–
resistant cells compared with parent cells. Western blotting
showed that expression of other ATP synthase complex
subunits was also lower in 5-FU–resistant cell lines and that
these resistant cells also showed decreased ATP synthase
activity and reduced intracellular ATP content. The ATP
synthase inhibitor, oligomycin A, strongly antagonized 5-FU–
induced suppression of cell proliferation. When 5-FU sensi-
tivity was compared with ATP synthase activity in six different
human colon cancer cell lines, a positive correlation has been
found. Furthermore, suppressed ATP synthase d-subunit
expression by siRNA transfection increased cell viability in
the presence of 5-FU. Bioenergetic dysfunction of mitochon-
dria has been reported as a hallmark of many types of cancers
(i.e., down-regulation of ATP synthase B-subunit expression in
liver, kidney, colon, squamous oesophageal, and lung carci-
nomas, as well as in breast and gastric adenocarcinomas). Our
findings show that ATP synthase down-regulation may not
only be a bioenergetic signature of colorectal carcinomas but
may also lead to cellular events responsible for 5-FU
resistance. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(8): 3162-70)
Introduction
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most widely used chemo-
therapeutic treatments for advanced colorectal cancer patients
and is still considered a mainstay of therapy (1). However, 5-FU
produces major responses in only about 10% of such patients (1).
Many attempts to enhance its therapeutic effectiveness (2, 3) have
resulted in only minor improvements in patient survival (4, 5). A
common critical issue for patients responding to 5-FU is the
development of resistance to the drug, which has become a major
obstacle in chemotherapy (6, 7).
Numerous efforts have been made to identify mechanisms
underlying 5-FU resistance (8–10). Some mechanisms seem to
involve thymidylate synthase, which is crucial in de novo synthesis
of thymidylate (11). Understanding 5-FU resistance mechanisms at
a molecular level seems essential to design strategies to overcome
this resistance.
To identify proteins involved in 5-FU resistance, we did
comparative proteomics using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
to screen proteins from human colon cancer cell lines with induced
5-FU resistance. In the present study, we found that mitochondrial
F1F0-ATP synthase (ATP synthase) was down-regulated in 5-FU–
resistant human colon cancer cells. ATP synthase is a complex of 16
different subunits, with a3h3gy and q comprising the F1 component,
and a, b, c, d, e, f, g, A6L, oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein
(OSCP), and coupling factor 6 comprising the F0 and stator (12, 13).
Also associated in the complex under some conditions is an intrinsic
inhibitor protein IF1 (14, 15).
Recently, down-regulation of ATP synthase h-subunit expression
has been reported in liver, kidney, colon, squamous oesophageal
and lung carcinomas, as well as in breast and gastric adenocarci-
nomas (16–18). These findings provided compelling evidence that
bioenergetic dysfunction of mitochondria is a hallmark of these
types of cancers, which is consistent with the Warburg hypothesis
(19). In the present study, we show that altered mitochondrial
bioenergetic features are also a characteristic of 5-FU–resistant
human colon cancer cells and indicate a link between mitochon-
drial ATP synthase and 5-FU resistance.
Materials and Methods
Human colon cancer cell lines and establishment of 5-fluorouracil–
resistant cell lines. Human colon cancer cell lines, SNU-81, SNU-769A, SNU-
769B, SNU-1033, SNU-C4, and SNU-C5 (20, 21), were obtained from the
Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). Three individual cell lines resistant to
the anticancer agent 5-FU (Choongwae Pharma Corporation, Gyeonggi,
Korea) were derived from SNU-C4, SNU-769A, and SNU-769B cells as
previously described (22).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide as-
say. A colorimetric assay using the tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylth-
iazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), was used to assess
suppression of cell proliferation by 5-FU (Dong-A Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.,
Seoul, Korea) or ATP synthase inhibitors, oligomycin A and aurovertin B
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Single-cell suspensions were prepared and cell
density was measured. MTT assays were done as previously described (22).
Briefly, an equal number of cells was added into each well in 0.18-mL
culture medium, to which 0.02 mL of 10 normal concentration of drug or
PBS ( for untreated 100% survival control) was added. After 4 days of
culture, 0.1 mg of MTT was added to each well and incubated at 37jC for a
further 4 hours. Plates were centrifuged at 450  g for 5 minutes at room
temperature and the medium removed. DMSO (0.15 mL) was added to
each well to solubilize the crystals and the plates were immediately read at
540 nm using a scanning multiwell spectrometer (Bio-Tek Instruments,

Inc., Burlington, VT). All experiments were done thrice and the mean and
SD of the IC50 (Ag/mL) values were calculated.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis–based comparative proteo-
mics. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis was done as previously
described (22). Briefly, 0.15-mg protein sample was applied to 13-cm
immobilized (pH 3-10) nonlinear gradient strips (Amersham Biosciences,
Uppsala, Sweden). Proteins were focused at 8,000 V within 3 hours. The
second-dimension separation used 12% polyacrylamide gels (chemicals from
Serva, Heidelberg, Germany and Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis gels were stained with Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) for 24 hours and then destained with deionized water.
Melanie 4 software (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzer-
land) was used for image analysis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
gels. Proteins showing abnormal expression were subjected to matrix-
associated laser desorption ionization-mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS)
analysis for identification.
MALDI-MS analysis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein spots
was done as previously described (22). Briefly, pieces of gel containing protein
spots of interest were excised, destained with 50% acetonitrile in 0.1 mol/L
ammonium bicarbonate, and dried in a Speedvac evaporator. The dried gel
pieces were reswollen with 3 AL of 3 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing
50 ng trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) and, after 15 minutes, 3 AL of water
were added. One microliter was applied to the dried matrix spot. The matrix
consisted of 15-mg nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and 20-mg a-cyano-4-hydrox-
ycinnamic acid (Sigma) dissolved in 1-mL acetone/isopropanol (1:1, v/v).
Matrix solution, 0.5 AL, was applied to the sample, and samples were then
analyzed using a QSTAR XL Hybrid liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a 20-kV
accelerating voltage. Peptide masses were matched with theoretical peptide
masses of all proteins from all species in the SWISS-PROT database.
Mitochondria subcellular fractionation and measurement of mito-
chondrial inner membrane potential. For isolation of an enriched,
functional mitochondrial fraction from cells, a ‘‘Mitochondria isolation kit’’
(Sigma) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. The fluorescent
carbocyanine dye JC-1 (5,5V-6,6V-tetrachloro-1,1V-3,3V-tetraethyl-benzimida-
zolyl-carbocyanine iodide) was used to measure the mitochondrial inner
membrane potential as it is actively taken up by respiring mitochondria.
Enzyme activity assays. Mitochondrial fractions were used for
determination of mitochondrial enzyme activity (i.e., ATP synthase and
serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity). ATP synthase activity, measured in
the direction of ATP hydrolysis (ATPase activity), was assayed using the
continuous spectrophotometric assay of Rosing et al. (23), except that 2
mmol/L EGTA (Sigma) replaced EDTA in the reactionmixture. Mitochondrial
fractions (enzyme source) were added to reaction mixtures containing 60
mmol/L sucrose, 50 mmol/LTris (pH 8.0), 50mmol/L KCl, 4 mmol/LMgCl2, 2
mmol/L ATP, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L KCN with 0.1 mmol/L NADH, 5
units/mL pyruvate kinase, and 5 units/mL lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma).
The total volume in the cuvette was 1 mL. The blank cuvette contained air.
The linear reaction was followed for 2 minutes at 340 nm at 25jC. One unit of
activity was defined as that required for oxidation of 1 Amol
NADHmin1mg1 at 25jC, pH 7.4, in the conditions specified above.
Serine hydroxymethyltransferase was assayed according to a modified
procedure described by Geller and Kotb (24). A complete assay reaction
mixture contained 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 3.0 mmol/L DTT, 0.25 mmol/L
pyridoxal phosphate, 2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 2.0 mmol/L tetrahydrofolic acid
(Sigma), 0.4 mmol/L L-serine containing L-[3-14C]serine (Amersham
Biosciences), and mitochondrial fraction (enzyme source). Weighed
amounts of tetrahydrofolic acid were added to the assay mixture
immediately before starting the incubation with L-serine/L-[3-14C]serine.
The reaction was carried out at 37jC and stopped by streaking a 25-AL
aliquot of the assay mixture onto a 2.3 cm in diameter disc of DE-81
(Whatman) filter paper. The filter was washed five times with 15-mL
distilled water and transferred to a scintillation vial containing 10-mL
scintillation cocktail for liquid scintillation counting. One unit of activity
was defined as 1 pmol of hydroxymethyl group of serine transferred to
tetrahydrofolic acidper minute per milligram at 37jC, pH 8.0, in the
conditions specified above.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) activity was deter-
mined as previously described (25). Briefly, cell protein extract was added to a
reaction mixture containing 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.5), 20
mmol/L sodium phosphate, 0.25 mmol/L NAD, and 3 Amol/L DTT. The
reaction was initiated by addition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (substrate)
andwas allowed to proceed for 5minutes. Activity of GADPHwas determined
by formation of NADH as measured by a gain in absorbance at 340 nm.
Measurement of intracellular ATP. Intracellular ATP content was
measured using an ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done as previously
described (22). Briefly, 4,000  g supernatants of cell homogenates
containing equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which were blocked by
incubating overnight at 4jC in 1% Tween 20-TBS buffer containing 1.5%
nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and 1 mmol/L MgCl2. Membranes
were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with primary antibody
against either ATP synthase a subunit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), h
subunit, d subunit, OSCP subunit, IF1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR),
Hsp60, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Abcam, Cambridgeshire, United
Kingdom), or actin (Sigma). Membranes were washed 3  15 minutes with
blocking solution and incubated with diluted horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) for 1
hour at room temperature. Membranes were then washed again (3  15
min) with blocking solution and incubated with WEST-ZOL (plus)
chemiluminescence reagent (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea) for 1
minute and exposed to film (Kodak Blue XB-1, Rochester, NY).
Fluoroscence-activated cell sorting assay. Cells were stained with
propidium iodide (Sigma) and analyzed using a FACScan machine (BD
Biosciences). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was done
as previously described (26). The percentage of propidium iodide–positive
cells was quantified.
siRNA synthesis and transfection. The following target sequences were
used to generate siRNAs (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA): 5V-TAATAATTATACAGT-
TAAA-3V(nucleotides 607-625 of Genbank accession no. NM_006356) for ATP
synthase d subunit and 5V-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3V for nonsilenc-
ing control. The synthetic siRNA duplexes were transfected to SNU-81 cells
via electroporation. Briefly, subconfluent monolayers of SNU-81 cells were
detached from the culture dishes by trypsin treatment, washed with PBS, and
adjusted to a concentration of 10  106 cells/mL of OPTI-MEM I culture
medium (Invitrogen). Then, 0.3 mL of the cell suspension (3  106 cells) was
mixed with siRNA ( final concentration, 5 Amol/L) by gentle pipetting,
transferred to a 0.4-cm-wide electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), and subjected
to an electric pulse at 0.9 mF and 170 V using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analyses. Between-group differences were calculated using
the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and within-group correlations were
calculated using the Spearman rank coefficient. Significance was set at the
P < 0.05. Antagonism was assessed by the method of Chou and Talalay (27)
using a nonfixed ratio experimental design and the Calcusyn software
(Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). A combination index value >1.0 indicates
antagonism.
Results
Down-regulation of ATP synthase in human colon cancer cell
lines with induced 5-fluorouracil resistance. 5-FU–resistant cell
lines were established from the human colon cancer cell lines SNU-
C4, SNU-769A, and SNU-769B. The 5-FU IC50 values for both resistant
and parent cell lines are shown in Table 1.
Whole cell protein extracts from SNU-C4 and its 5-FU–resistant
derivative line, SNU-C4R, were analyzed using two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). A protein spot with a molecular size
of 70 kDa and pI 10.0 was observed to be expressed at lower
levels in SNU-C4R cells compared with the parent cell line
(Fig. 1A). The spot was excised from the two-dimensional gel

electrophoresis gel, digested by trypsin, and subjected to MALDI-
MS analysis to determine peptide masses. A SWISS-PROT
database search identified the protein as the ATP synthase a
subunit (Fig. 1B).
Down-regulation of ATP synthase a subunit in SNU-C4R cells
was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Protein levels of
other subunits comprising the ATP synthase complex were also
determined. Like the a subunit, the d subunit, OSCP, and the
endogenous inhibitor protein of ATP synthase, IF1, were at lower
levels in SNU-C4R cells compared with parent cells. Expression of
the h subunit and the mitochondrial marker protein Hsp60 was
similar in both lines (Fig. 2A).
Consistent with down-regulation of ATP synthase subunits, both
ATP synthase activity, normalized to mitochondrial serine hydrox-
ymethyltransferase, and intracellular ATP content were significantly
decreased in SNU-C4R cells compared with parent cells (both P =
0.0286; Fig. 2B and C). In contrast, neither mitochondrial membrane
potential nor GAPDH activity was altered (Fig. 2B , right , and D).
Using Western blotting, we investigated expression of ATP
synthase subunits in other human colon cancer cell lines with
induced 5-FU resistance. We found that expression of a, h, d, and
OSCP subunits was lower in both SNU-769AR and SNU-769BR cells
compared with their respective patent cells (Fig. 3). IF1 and Hsp60
expression was the same in both resistant and parent cells (Fig. 3).
5-Fluorouracil suppression of cell proliferation is overcome
by ATP synthase inhibitors. We investigated whether cell
proliferation was affected by the ATP synthase inhibitors oligomycin
A and aurovertin B. Cells were incubated with an ATP synthase

inhibitor for 4 days, after which cell proliferation was determined by
MTT assay. We found that both ATP synthase inhibitors dose-
dependently inhibited proliferation in both SNU-C4 and SNU-C4R
cells, with dose-response being similar for both resistant and parent
cells (Fig. 4A). Aurovertin B at 0.1 Amol/L failed to suppress
proliferation of either SNU-C4 and SNU-C4R cells (Fig. 4A).
The 5-FU concentrations suppressing cell proliferation by 50%
and 80% were determined and defined as IC50 and IC80, respectively.
SNU-C4 and SNU-C4R cells were incubated at the IC50 or IC80 for 5-
FU in the presence of either oligomycin A or aurovertin B in the
range 0.1 to 1 Amol/L, and proliferation was monitored (Fig. 4B). In
all cases, the combination index values between 5-FU and ATP
synthase inhibitor were greater than 1 (data not shown). These
results show strong antagonism between ATP synthase inhibitor and
5-FU on suppression of cell proliferation. In the presence of 5-FU
IC80, both SNU-C4 and SNU-C4R cells treated with either 0.1 or 1.0
Amol/L oligomycin A showed significantly increased proliferation
compared with cells treated with 5-FU alone (Fig. 4B , bottom left ;
***P = 0.0003 and **P = 0.00222, respectively, for SNU-C4 cells, both

when 5-FU–resistant cells were incubated with 0.1 Amol/L
aurovertin B at 5-FU IC50 (Fig. 4B , top right ; *P = 0.0028). In parallel
with the above proliferation experiments, apoptosis was examined
in SNU-C4 parent cells incubated with 0.1 Amol/L oligomycin and 5-
FU IC80. FACS analysis of propidium iodide–stained nuclei to assess

polymerase cleavage showed that oligomycin had no antagonistic
effect on 5-FU–induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C).
Positive correlation between ATP synthase expression and
5-fluorouracil sensitivity in human colorectal cancer cell
lines. Western blot analysis was done to determine levels of each
ATP synthase subunit in six different human colon cancer cell lines
(Fig. 5A). We found that in each line, levels of all subunits except IF1
positively correlated with each other; the expression of IF1 did not
correlate with any other subunit (Fig. 5B).
We compared 5-FU sensitivity and ATP synthase complex
expression and activity in six different human colon cancer cell
lines. We found that 5-FU sensitivity positively correlated with ATP
synthase d-subunit expression and with ATP synthase activity (both
P = 0.0028; Fig. 5C , bottom , and D). Although expression of the ATP
synthase a subunit also seemed to show a positive correlation with
5-FU sensitivity, this correlation did not quite reach the level set for
statistical significance (P = 0.0583; Fig. 5C , top). Neither mitochon-
dria membrane potential nor intracellular ATP content correlated
with ATP synthase activity (Fig. 5E).
Effect of suppressed ATP synthase d-subunit expression on
5-fluorouracil sensitivity. To verify a causative role of ATP
synthase for 5-FU resistance, SNU-81 cells were transfected with
siRNA specific to ATP synthase d subunit and cell viability was
determined in the presence of 5-FU. The expression of ATP
synthase d subunit was efficiently suppressed at 24 hours after
transfection with ATP synthase d-subunit siRNA, and this
suppression was continued up to 72 hours regardless of the
presence of 5-FU (100 Ag/mL; Fig. 6A). However, the expression of
mitochondrial marker Hsp60 was not affected by transfection of
siRNA (Fig. 6A). When cell viability was determined at 72 hours
after transfection (48 hours after 5-FU treatment), cells transfected
with ATP synthase d-subunit siRNA showed higher viability in
various concentrations of 5-FU (0.1, 1.0, 10 or 100 Ag/mL) compared
with cells transfected with either nonsilencing control siRNA or PBS
buffer (Fig. 6B).
Discussion
Mitochondria play a pivotal role in providing energy for cells
and in execution of apoptosis (28–30). However, the role of
mitochondria in cancer is not clear. In 1930, Warburg (19)
proposed the hypothesis that cancer cells may have impaired
mitochondrial function and that this alteration would result in an
elevated rate of glycolysis. Glycolytic characteristics of cancer cells
have been studied at both biochemical and molecular levels (31,
32) but impaired mitochondrial function is not established in
cancer biology (33). Recently, Warburg’s hypothesis was supported
by studies from Cuezva and coworkers (16–18) which provided two
alternative pathways by which cancer cells down-regulate mito-
chondrial activity (16). In liver cancer there seems to be a general
reduction in mitochondrial components, consistent with repressed
mitochondrial proliferation (34). In contrast, in kidney, colon,
squamous oesophageal and lung carcinomas, as well as in lung,
breast and gastric adenocarcinomas, expression of the h subunit of
ATP synthase was lower, consistent with selective repression of the
expression of components involved in mitochondrial bioenergetic
function (16–18).
Because of oxidative phosphorylation coupled with mitochon-
drial respiration, the down-regulation of ATP synthase may inhibit
the electrons flux to the respiratory chain. This limited electron flux
would increase the level of superoxide radical, which causes DNA
damage and mitochondrial mediated cell death. Cuezva et al. (16),
therefore, showed that cells with down-regulation of ATP synthase
would be prone to establishing a transformed phenotype. However,
the role of down-regulated ATP synthase for carcinogenesis still
remains to be clarified.
Cuezva et al. (16) suggested that a defect in mitochondrial ATP
synthase is not only a bioenergetic feature of many cancer types
but may also be a link to chemotherapy and radiotherapy
resistance because the overall oxidative phosphorylation capabil-
ity of the cell is diminished and, thus, the apoptotic potential of
the cancer cell is hampered (35, 36). Interestingly, we found that
dysregulated expression of ATP synthase complex protein
subunits resulted in decreased ATP synthase activity in 5-FU–
resistant human colon cancer cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore,
the sensitivity of human colorectal cancer cell lines to 5-FU
correlated with ATP synthase activity (Fig. 5). However, neither
GAPDH activity, which represents cellular glycolytic potential (16),
nor membrane potential, which is crucial for ATP synthesis by
ATP synthase (37), was altered in 5-FU–resistant cells compared
with parent cells (Fig. 2B and D). These findings show there is a
link between 5-FU chemoresistance and ATP synthase down-
regulation.
Because ATP synthase activity and protein expression were
both down-regulated in human colon cancer cell lines with
induced 5-FU resistance, we investigated whether expression of
an endogenous natural ATP synthase inhibitor, IF1, was altered
in 5-FU–resistant cells. Although IF1 is considered part of the in
vivo control mechanism proposed to regulate the ATP synthase
complex (38), we found expression of IF1 was not altered in 5-
FU–resistant human colon cancer cells (Figs. 2A and 3).
Furthermore, expression of IF1 did not correlate with either 5-
FU sensitivity or ATP synthase activity in human colorectal
cancer cells (data not shown). These results suggest IF1 does not
play critical roles in either regulation of ATP synthase activity or
induced 5-FU resistance in human colon cancer cell lines.
We examined whether 5-FU resistance was affected by addition
of exogenous ATP synthase inhibitors. Oligomycin A is an inhibitor
of the F0 part of ATP synthase (39) whereas aurovertin B inhibits
the ATP synthase F1 catalytic sector (40). Interestingly, the
combination index values between 5-FU and ATP synthase
inhibitors were greater than 1 (data not shown), demonstrating
strong antagonism between the two compounds on suppression of
cell proliferation. In the presence of 5-FU IC80, cells treated with
oligomycin A recovered cell proliferation compared with cells
treated with 5-FU IC80 alone (Fig. 4B , bottom left). Similar effects
were observed when cells were incubated with aurovertin B and 5-
FU IC50 (Fig. 4B , top right). These findings further support a link
between ATP synthase activity and 5-FU resistance in human
colon cancer cells.
Experiments examining the effect of 5-FU and ATP synthase
inhibitors on apoptosis were run simultaneously with those
examining proliferation (Fig. 4C). These apoptosis studies showed
that at an oligomycin concentration which significantly decreased
intracellular ATP content, apoptotic death induced by 5-FU was
not antagonized in spite of suppression of 5-FU–induced growth
inhibition. Reduction of ATP can also block apoptosis and/or
switch apoptotic death mechanisms to necrosis, and this effect
was assumed to underlie the antiapoptotic action of oligomycin
during apoptosis induced by such anticancer drugs as etoposide
and dexamethasone (41, 42). Oligomycin is reported to trigger
several antiapoptotic events, including reduction of ATP, blocking

of Bax dimerization (39, 41, 42), and inhibition of cytochrome c
release (43, 44). Interestingly, Shchepina et al. (39) showed that
oligomycin also has an antiapoptotic function not involving
inhibition of ATP synthesis. Whereas the precise antiapoptotic
mechanisms invoked by oligomycin remain undetermined, the
present data indicate that increased resistance to 5-FU (i.e.,
increased cell proliferation) was not due to antiapoptotic effects of
oligomycin.
Although our data showed the link between ATP synthase and
5-FU resistance in human colorectal cancer cells, the causative
role of ATP synthase for 5-FU resistance had to be clarified. In
this sense, SNU-81 cells, which are sensitive to 5-FU and have
high level of ATP synthase d-subunit expression, were used for
siRNA approaches. Transfection with ATP synthase d-subunit
siRNA efficiently suppressed its expression (Fig. 6A) and allowed
SNU-81 cells a higher viability in the presence of 5-FU (Fig. 6B).
Figure 4. Mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitors antagonize
5-FU–induced suppression of cell proliferation. A, cell proliferation is
suppressed by the ATP synthase inhibitors, oligomycin A, and
aurobertin B. After 4 days of incubation with an ATP synthase inhibitor,
cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. B, antagonism between
ATP synthase inhibitors and 5-FU on suppression of cell proliferation.
5-FU concentrations suppressing cell proliferation by 50% and 80%
were defined as IC50 and IC80, respectively. After 4 days of incubation with
5-FU with or without an ATP synthase inhibitor, cell proliferation was
determined by MTT assay. In all cases, the combination index values
between 5-FU and ATP synthase inhibitors were greater than 1
(data not shown). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 when compared
with proliferation suppressed by 5-FU alone. C, effect of oligomycin A
on intracellular ATP content and apoptosis induced by 5-FU. Cells
were incubated with 0.1 Amol/L oligomycin in the presence or absence
of 5-FU IC80. ***, P < 0.001 when compared with cell proliferation
suppressed by 5-FU alone. Columns, mean of three independent
experiments; bars, SD.

These findings provide strong evidence that down-regulation of
ATP synthase can be a single molecular event to modulate the
response to 5-FU in human colorectal cancer cells.
In summary, the present study reports the down-regulation of ATP
synthase in human colon cancer cells with induced 5-FU resistance.
The mechanism(s) explaining how decreased ATP synthase, and
thus decreased intracellular ATP, leads to intracellular events
responsible for increasing cell proliferation in the presence of 5-FU
remains to be determined. However, our findings show that ATP
synthase down-regulation may not only be a bioenergetic signature
of colorectal carcinomas but may also lead to cellular events
responsible for 5-FU resistance.

Figure 6. Suppressed ATP synthase d-subunit expression
by siRNA transfection (A) and its effect on 5-FU sensitivity
(B). SNU-81 cells were transfected with either 5 Amol/L
of siRNA specific to ATP synthase d subunit, 5 Amol/L of
nonsilencing control siRNA, or PBS buffer only.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with
various concentrations of 5-FU (0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 Ag/mL).
Every 24 hours after transfection, cell lysates were
prepared from each transfected cells and expression of
ATP synthase d subunit was determined by Western blot
analysis. Suppressed expression of ATP synthase d
subunit was monitored 24 hours after transfection of ATP
synthase d-subunit siRNA, and this suppression was
continued up to 72 hours regardless of the treatment of
5-FU. A, an example of Western blot analysis obtained
from cells treated with 100 Ag/mL 5-FU at 24 hours after
transfection. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay at
72 hours after transfection (48 hours after 5-FU treatment;
B). Transfection with ATP synthase d-subunit siRNA not
only led to suppression of ATP synthase d-subunit
expression (A) but also allowed SNU-81 cells higher
viability in the presence of 5-FU compared with controls
(B). Columns, mean of three independent experiments;
