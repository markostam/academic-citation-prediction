Abstract
Cancer initiation and progression can involve microRNAs
(miRNA), which are small noncoding RNAs that can regulate
gene expression. Their expression profiles can be used for the
classification, diagnosis, and prognosis of human malignan-
cies. Loss or amplification of miRNA genes has been reported
in a variety of cancers, and altered patterns of miRNA expres-
sionmay affect cell cycle and survival programs. Germ-line and
somatic mutations in miRNAs or polymorphisms in the mRNAs
targeted by miRNAs may also contribute to cancer predispo-
sition and progression. We propose that alterations in miRNA
genes play a critical role in the pathophysiology of many,
perhaps all, human cancers. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(15): 7390-4)
Cancer-Specific MicroRNA Fingerprints
Cancer is a very complex genetic disease characterized by alter-
ations in genes encoding oncogenic and tumor-suppressor pro-
teins [protein coding genes (PCG)]. First described in C. elegans
more than a decade ago (1), >3,000 members of a new class of small
noncoding RNAs, named microRNAs (miRNAs; ref. 2), have been
identified in the last 5 years in vertebrates, flies, worms, and plants,
and even in viruses. Functionally, it was shown that miRNAs reduce
the levels of many of their target transcripts as well as the amount
of protein encoded by these transcripts (3). For several miRNAs,
the participation in essential biological processes has been proved,
such as cell proliferation control (miR-125b and let-7), hematopoi-
etic B-cell lineage fate (miR-181), B-cell survival (miR-15a and
miR-16-1), brain patterning (miR-430), pancreatic cell insulin
secretion (miR-375), and adipocyte development (miR-143 ; for
reviews, see ref. 4).
After the identification of two clustered miRNAs as the targets of
homozygous and heterozygous deletions and translocations at
13q14.3 in human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL;
ref. 5), the question to be answered was how general is the
involvement of miRNAs in human cancers. The development of
miRNA microarrays was a necessary step for the high-throughput
miRNA fingerprint investigation in normal and cancer cells (6).
Other technologies, including macroarrays (7), bead-based flow
cytometric miRNA expression (8), and quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (9), are now available. What we learned from
such expression studies is reshaping the landscape of cancer
genomics (Table 1 and included references).
Cancer-specific miRNA fingerprints were identified in every type
of analyzed cancer, including B-CLL (10), breast carcinoma (11),
primary glioblastoma (12), hepatocellular carcinoma (13), papillary
thyroid carcinoma (14), lung cancer (15–17), gastric carcinoma,
colon carcinoma (18), and endocrine pancreatic tumors (17). Not
only the spectrum of miRNAs expressed in malignant cells is
significantly different from that of normal counterpart cells but
also miRNA expression profiles better classify poorly differentiated
tumors as compared with the mRNA (EST)-based classifier (8).
Commonly deregulated miRNAs in different types of solid cancers
predict their involvement in fundamental pathways and their
interaction with important cancer-specific PCGs (17). Furthermore,
such abnormal expression was found not only in malignant cells
but also in premalignant stages, such as colon adenomas where
miR-143 and miR-145 expression is reduced (18) or in pituitary
adenomas, a type of benign tumors displaying deletions at 13q14.3
and reduced expression of miR-16-1 and miR-15a (19). The finding
that essentially all indolent CLLs have lost miR-15a/miR-16-1
expression suggests that this event is the initiating event in the
pathogenesis of the indolent form of CLL (5, 10, 20). Furthermore, it
was shown that miR-221 , highly overexpressed in papillary thyroid
tumors, is also overexpressed in normal thyroid tissue adjacent to
tumors but not in normal thyroid tissues from individuals without
clinical thyroid disease (14). Therefore, it seems likely that, in some
cases, the cancer-specific miRNA fingerprints represent events
involved in the initiation of the malignant process.
What are the causes of the widespread miRNA misexpression in
cancers? Although not clearly understood, the origins of such
abnormalities seem to be multiple. Many miRNAs reside in
genomic regions involved in cancer, including minimal regions of
loss of heterozygosity (LOH), minimal amplicons, or breakpoint
cluster regions (21). As shown in Table 1, the overexpressed
oncogenic miRNAs are located in amplified regions and the down-
regulated suppressor miRNAs in deleted regions in cancers. The
proof that chromosomal rearrangements are causal includes the
early report of a masked t(8;17) translocation that resulted in an
aggressive B-cell leukemia by overexpressing c-myc oncogene by an
unknown mechanism at the moment of identification (22). It was
shown later that miR-142 is located at the chromosome 17
breakpoint and that c-Myc was rearranged under the control of the
promoter of miR-142 with consequent overexpression. In a pre-
cursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, an insertion of miR-
125b-1 into a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain locus was
described, suggesting an early involvement in leukemogenesis (23).
Mutations in MiRNAs: A Way to Predispose to
Cancer?
In spite of decades of research, the molecular basis for the major
fraction of familial cancers is unknown. CLL represents one of the
main examples in this regard: a significant portion (10-20%) of
patients have a family history of CLL or other hematologic or solid
cancers whereas no clear culprit could be found by scanning PCGs
(20, 24). Screening the human miRNoma for sequence abnormal-
ities located either in the pre-miRNA or in pri-miRNA, a higher
frequency of germ-line or somatic mutations (about 15%), as
expected by the small size of miRNA genes was found (25).

Furthermore, a germ-line mutation in the pri-miR-16-1/15a
precursor in a patient with familial CLL and breast cancer in
first-degree members of family suggests a possible predisposing
effect. The roles of mutations in miRNAs have still to be elucidated,
and tumor-specific pri-miRNA sequence abnormalities seem to be
a more widespread phenomenon in tumorigenesis since mutations
near the clusters miR-17-92 on chromosome 13 and miR-106-92 on
chromosome X were described in a mouse model (26). It was

shown that the cluster miR-17-92 is amplified in human lym-
phomas (27, 28) and accelerates c-Myc-induced tumorigenesis in a
mouse model of B-cell lymphoma (29), suggesting a pathogenetic
role of such mutations.
As the thermodynamics of RNA-RNA binding plays essential
roles in the miRNA interaction with the target mRNA, it is sup-
posed that sequence variations influencing this interaction will be
identified in cancers. Thyroid cancers in which the up-regulation
of miR-221, miR-222 , and miR-146 was the strongest showed
dramatic loss of KIT oncogene and, in half of the cases, the down-
regulation was associated with germ-line single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms in the two recognition sites in KIT for these three
miRNAs (14). It has to be noted that thyroid papillary carcinoma is
a type of cancer with high familiarity without known genetic bases.
As the 3¶ untranslated region (UTR) of PCGs was scarcely screened
for mutations/polymorphisms, it is possible that the extent of such
abnormalities might be much larger than initially thought. Further
strengthening possible roles of polymorphisms in altering the
function of miRNAs, a study in Japanese normal subjects screened
for single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomic regions
corresponding to 173 precursor miRNAs found a polymorphism
in the mature miR-30c-2 sequence that may alter target selection
and exert biological effects (30). Making the story more intriguing,
this miRNA is a member of a common expression signature
characterizing several solid cancers (17). Putting all these data
together, it is tempting to propose that germ-line mutations or
polymorphisms in miRNA genes or interacting sequences in target
mRNA might represent a newly described mechanism of cancer
predisposition. Further identification of sequence or expression
variations in miRNAs in a large series of familial cancer patients is
needed to clearly prove this hypothesis.
MiRNAs: From the Scientist Bench to the
Patient Bedside
It is well known that PCGs with important cancer connections
are used also as diagnosis markers and therapy targets. If the
miRNAs are active players in human oncogenesis, then they will
have an effect on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer (Table 1).
In fact, evidence that miRNAs represent new diagnostic and
prognostic factors in human cancers is rapidly accumulating. In B-
CLL, a unique miRNA signature is associated with prognostic
factors and with the time from diagnosis to initiation of therapy
(25). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, independent studies
revealed that significantly higher levels of miR-155 occur in cases
with poorer prognosis (an activated B-cell phenotype) than in those
with the germinal center phenotype (31, 32). Expression of
members of let-7 family correlates with postoperative survival in
lung cancer, the group of patients with reduced expression showing
significantly shorter survival after potentially curative resection
(15). In lung adenocarcinomas, high miR-155 and low let-7a-2
expression correlates with poor survival (16). In breast carcinomas,
miRNA expression was correlated with specific biopathologic fea-
tures, such as estrogen and progesterone receptor expression (the
members of miR-30 family), or tumor stage (miR-213 and miR-203 ;
ref. 11). Expression of three genes, miR-92, miR-20 , and miR-18 , was
inversely correlated with the degree of hepatocellular carcinoma
differentiation (13). Such results strongly suggest that quantifica-
tion of miRNAs may be diagnostically useful.
To understand the possible role of miRNAs as putative thera-
peutic agents, we have to elucidate the consequences of the wide-
spread miRNA dysregulation in cancer cells. In lung cancers, acti-
vation of RAS genes by point mutations, identified more than two
decades ago, may represent an early event in some tumors. RAS pro-
tein is significantly higher in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue
whereas let-7 expression is lower in lung cancer cells. This corre-
lation led to the identification of a direct regulation of RAS by
the let-7 miRNA family (33). Exogenous delivery of let-7 to the lung
might either prevent the formation of lung tumors ( from prema-
lignant lesions) or shrink tumors with activating RAS mutations (34).
MiRNAs are natural antisense interactors with players in the
eukaryotic survival and cell cycle programs. The overexpression of
antiapoptotic protein BCL2 is an important genetic event in
human tumorigenesis, including follicular lymphoma, lung cancer,
and B-CLL. The mechanism of this activation, except in all cases of
follicular lymphomas where a translocation t(14;18) is responsible
(35), was unknown. Loss of miR-15a/miR-16-1 in CLL results in
BCL2 overexpression and restoration of mir-15/miR-16 in leukemia
cells induces apoptosis by directly interacting with BCL2 mRNA
(36). These results are encouraging in the light of new promising
results on the therapeutic potential of antisense BCL2 .
The oncogene c-myc encodes a transcription factor that
regulates, via several targets including E2F1 transcription factor,
cell proliferation and survival. A feedback regulatory loop in which
MYC directly binds and activates the transcription of the cluster
miR-17-92 that consequently negatively regulates E2F1 by direct
interaction, while c-Myc is directly inducing expression of the E2F1
that in turn induces c-Myc, was recently described (37). This fine
molecular dissection of an important cellular pathway has cancer
implications, as it was shown that c-myc and miR-17-92 cooperate
and such cooperation accelerates B-cell tumorigenesis in a mouse
lymphoma model (29). Such results offer a rationale basis for
targeted therapy (e.g., by using antisense miRNAs against the
clustered miRNAs) that will overload the regulatory loop, with the
acceeration of the MYC-E2F1 feedback and consequent cell death.
The ‘‘MiRNA Cascade’’: A Model of MiRNA
Involvement in Human Cancers
MiRNAs are contributors to oncogenesis, functioning as tumor
suppressors (as is the case of miR-15a and miR-16-1) or as
oncogenes (as is the case of miR-155 or miR17-92 cluster ; Fig. 1;
refs. 21, 34). The classic tumorigenesis model postulates alterations
in protein-coding oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
Relatively minor variations in the levels of expression of a miRNA
or mutations that affect moderately the conformation of miR-
NA::mRNA pairing could have important consequences for the cell.
The explanation is provided by the large number of targets of each
miRNA and the relatively large number of altered miRNAs, making
very likely that two or more PCGs from different molecular
pathways/interacting pathways are disturbed. The down-regulation
of the suppressor miR-15a/miR-16-1 induces overexpression of
BCL2 and possibly other genes that may be important for
tumorigenesis, whereas the overexpression of oncogenic miR-17-
92 cooperates with c-myc in stimulating proliferation. Therefore,
the miRNAs may act ‘‘in cascade’’ over several cancer-specific
PCGs, which in turn could influence the transcription or function
of several other PCGs and noncoding RNAs including miRNAs.
If miRNA alterations occur in somatic cells, they could initiate or
contribute to tumorigenesis, whereas, if present in the germ-line,
could represent cancer-predisposing events. A paradigm for this
model is human B-CLL, in which miR-15a and miR-16-1 are located

in the most frequently deleted genomic region, are down-regulated
in the majority of cases, harbor mutations in familial cases, and
induce apoptosis in a leukemia model by targeting the overex-
pressed antiapoptotic BCL2 gene. As the puzzle of noncoding RNA
involvement in cancer is just starting to be assembled, certainly
further unexpected pieces will be identified in the near future.

Figure 1. miRNA activation and inactivation events and cooperation with protein coding genes in human tumorigenesis. The abnormalities found to influence the
activity of miRNAs are the same as those described to target PCGs, including chromosomal rearrangements, genomic amplifications or deletions, and mutations.
In a specific tumor, both abnormalities in PCGs and miRNAs can be identified. Inactivation of tumor suppressor PCGs and activation of oncogenic miRNAs have the
same molecular consequences: reduced levels of proteins blocking proliferation and activating apoptosis. By contrast, activation of oncogenic PCGs and inactivation of
suppressor miRNAs are followed by accumulation of proteins that stimulate proliferation and decrease apoptosis. For example, effects of t(14;18)(q32;q21) or
del13q14.3 in leukemic cells are the same: overexpression of the antiapoptotic BCL2 protein, in the former case by juxtaposition of oncogene BCL2 to immunoglobulin
enhancers and in the latter by down-regulation of suppressor miR-16-1 and miR-15a , which negatively regulate BCL2 production. Triangles, promoter regions;
