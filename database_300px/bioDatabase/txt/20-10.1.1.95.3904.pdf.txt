ABSTRACT
In recent years, there have been increasing numbers
of transcripts identified that do not encode proteins,
many of which are developmentally regulated and
appear to have regulatory functions. Here, we
describe the construction of a comprehensive mam-
malian noncoding RNA database (RNAdb) which
containsover 800uniqueexperimentally studiednon-
coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including many associated
with diseases and/or developmental processes. The
database is available at http://research.imb.uq.
edu.au/RNAdb and is searchable by many criteria. It
includes microRNAs and snoRNAs, but not infra-
structural RNAs, such as rRNAs and tRNAs, which
arecataloguedelsewhere.Thedatabasealso includes
over 1100 putative antisense ncRNAs and almost
20 000putative ncRNAs identified inhigh-qualitymur-
ine and human cDNA libraries, with more to be added
in the near future. Many of these RNAs are large, and
many are spliced, some alternatively. The database
will be useful as a foundation for the emerging field
of RNomics and the characterization of the roles
of ncRNAs in mammalian gene expression and
regulation.
INTRODUCTION
The traditional view of the genomic programming of cells and
organisms is predicated on the belief that genetic information
normally flows from DNA to RNA to protein. As a conse-
quence, genes are generally considered to be synonymous with
proteins, which carry out the majority of the structural, cata-
lytic and regulatory transactions in living cells, with RNA
functioning primarily as an intermediate coding template
for protein synthesis, aided by infrastructural RNAs that are
central to the process (tRNAs and rRNAs). This view of the
structure of molecular genetic systems is essentially correct in
prokaryotes, whose genomes consist almost entirely of closely
spaced protein-coding sequences flanked by cis-acting regu-
latory elements that act to control transcription and translation,
although it has recently become clear that prokaryotes also
express limited numbers of small regulatory RNAs. However,
these occupy <1% of the genome sequence in prokaryotes (1).
In contrast, non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNAs) sequences are
abundant in the genomes of the eukaryotes, especially the
developmentally complex multicellular eukaryotes, where
they dominate transcriptional output (2). These RNAs are
composed of transcribed introns from protein-coding genes,
and an increasing but, as yet, undetermined number of tran-
scripts that do not encode proteins and may or may not them-
selves contain introns, collectively termed ncRNAs (2–5).
The evidence for large numbers of ncRNA transcripts in
eukaryotes is increasing. There are large numbers of sequences
that do not contain a significant open reading frame (ORF) in
well-constructed mammalian cDNA collections (6,7), many of
which show variation in their expression in different cells and
developmental stages. The number of detectable RNAs
derived from human chromosomes 21 and 22 has been
shown to be at least an order of magnitude higher than that
expected from known protein-coding sequences (8,9). All
well-studied loci (including b-globin, bithorax and various
imprinted loci) show a predominance of non-coding tran-
scripts, many of which are developmentally regulated and
appear themselves to have regulatory functions (10–12). Care-
ful analysis of human chromosome 7 has identified 213
ncRNA genes, indicating by extrapolation that the number
of ncRNA genes in the human genome is more than 3500
(13) while other estimates based on the integration of data
from a wide variety of sources suggests that the majority of

all human genes encode ncRNAs (3,5). Indeed, while protein-
coding sequences occupy <1.5% of the human genome, it is
clear that at least 50% of the genome is transcribed (2).
ncRNAs have been identified in various ways. Early exam-
ples such as lin-4, Xist, IPW, NTT and BC200 were discovered
and characterized experimentally on an ad hoc basis, and their
lack of protein-coding capacity was unexpected (references for
individual ncRNAs are listed in Supplementary Material 1).
Many of these RNAs, expressed in particular tissues and/or
developmental stages, are associated with particular diseases
including various cancers (14–20), schizophrenia (21), ataxia
(22), cartilage-hair hypoplasia (19), DiGeorge syndrome (23)
and autism (13), and/or are involved in complex genetic phe-
nomena such as imprinting and other forms of epigenetic
control of gene expression (12,24). More recently, there
have been targeted experimental approaches to the large-
scale discovery of ncRNA genes. The presence of hundreds
of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoR-
NAs) has been established experimentally by specifically
screening for tiny RNA species (25–27), at least some of
which have been implicated in the control of development
(28–30) and in the etiology of cancer (31–33). As noted
above, thousands of larger ncRNA transcripts have also
been putatively identified via the systematic sequencing and
annotation of tens of thousands of full-length cDNAs (6,7).
Recent advances in computational genomics are also helping
to identify ncRNAs of particular types. New algorithms have
been used to search the genomic sequence databases for mem-
bers that share secondary structure motifs with existing
ncRNA families (34,35), although there remain large numbers
of ncRNAs which do not yet appear to share recognizable
primary or secondary structural motifs and hence cannot be
identified by these methods.
The term ‘non-coding RNA’ in its broadest sense includes
all RNAs that do not code for protein (i.e. non-messenger
RNAs) and encompasses transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal
RNAs (rRNAs) and spliceosomal RNAs, which largely have
basic housekeeping functions in cells. Many other ncRNAs,
however, have been shown to perform regulatory functions
within the cell including phenomena such as the temporal
suppression of mRNA translation, RNA interference, imprint-
ing, DNA methylation and X chromosome dosage compensa-
tion (3,5). So, while precise biological roles for the vast
majority of these non-messenger, non-infrastructural RNAs
are still to be elucidated, such ncRNAs have been proposed
to serve as a diverse and hitherto hidden regulatory network in
eukaryotic cells (2,3).
At present, there is no comprehensive database of ncRNAs,
although there are several existing databases that cover aspects
of the field. tRNAs and rRNAs are listed within multiple
databases (35–37). The miRNA registry provides a searchable
database of published miRNA sequences (38). The Rfam data-
base contains thousands of mammalian RNAs, the majority of
which are infrastructural RNAs (tRNAs, etc.) and predicted
using co-variance models from multiple-sequence alignments
of genomic datasets with little direct experimental support for
their transcription (35). Notably, many well-documented reg-
ulatory ncRNAs such as Xist and NTT are not listed in Rfam,
reflecting a bias to include only those entries that are members
of particular structure-based RNA families. A ‘regulatory’
ncRNA database has been published previously (39) but the
total number of unique mammalian ncRNAs in this database is
<40 excluding homologs and miRNAs.
AIMS OF THE DATABASE
Here, we describe a new ncRNA database, RNAdb. The broad
aims of RNAdb are 2-fold. First, to provide a searchable
sequence repository for mammalian ncRNAs whose function
may be regulatory and whose existence is supported by experi-
mental evidence. Being sequence-oriented, the database per-
mits not only bioinformatic analyses but also the rational
design of experimental tools such as microarray chips to char-
acterize the roles of ncRNAs in mammalian gene expression
and regulation. The second aim is to highlight to the scientific
community the presence of thousands of potentially regulatory
ncRNAs.
RNAdb contains a comprehensive listing of mammalian
ncRNAs, but excludes tRNAs, rRNAs and spliceosomal
RNAs. More than 800 unique known mammalian ncRNAs
are included in the database, around two-thirds of which
are miRNAs and snoRNAs. The rest are largely of unknown
function, but some are known to be developmentally regu-
lated, disease-associated, imprinted, expressed pseudogenes
or antisense transcripts. As well as sequence data, additional
information—including GenBank accession numbers, species,
references, chromosomal location, transcript length, splicing
status, conservation notes, function, disease associations, anti-
sense relationships, imprinting status and tissue expression
patterns—is provided wherever possible in separate search-
able fields. The database also includes almost 20 000 putative
ncRNAs identified in high-quality cDNA libraries (6,7), with
more to be added in the near future. At this stage, we have
restricted the database to mammalian ncRNAs, as this group
has the best information and is most relevant to humans and
disease, but we expect that many of these ncRNAs will have
paralogs in other vertebrates, and that the database will even-
tually be extended to include ncRNAs from other vertebrates
and from invertebrates.
DATABASE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN
ncRNAs were included in RNAdb provided that (i) there was
experimental (i.e. EST, cDNA, RT–PCR and/or northern blot)
evidence to support their existence as RNAs; (ii) they did not
contain a significant ORF (i.e. <100 amino acids); (iii) they
were not annotated as rRNAs, tRNAs and spliceosomal RNAs;
and (iv) they were mammalian.
ncRNAs that satisfied these requirements were identified
from the following sources: a comprehensive literature review;
the Functional Annotation of Mouse (FANTOM) and the
H-Invitational databases,which contain over 60 000 and 20 000
annotated gene candidates identified from mouse and human
full-length cDNA libraries, respectively; the human chromo-
some 7 annotation project; the miRNA registry; and public
sequence databases at NCBI, Ensembl and UCSC. A novel
pipeline was designed to identify putative antisense ncRNAs
from the public databases (Supplementary Material 2).
For individual ncRNAs with direct support in the literature,
the details (sequence, accession number, organism, chromo-
somal location, etc.) were manually curated where possible.
D126 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, Database issue
For ncRNAs identified from large-scale discovery projects
such as FANTOM and H-Invitational, information was
restricted to that already publicly available. Further informa-
tion will be obtained and incorporated in the near future.
All the information is currently stored in a Microsoft
SQL2000 relational database which runs on a Microsoft.NET
platform.
DATABASE ACCESS AND INTERFACE
RNAdb is hosted at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience and
is freely available at http://research.imb.uq.edu.au/RNAdb.
The entire database is available for download in XML format
via the website.
The web interface allows users to browse the entire collec-
tion or to search for specific ncRNAs of interest. Searches are
executed either by performing keyword searches or by apply-
ing filters to nominated fields including organism, chromo-
some number, ncRNA category and ncRNA feature (e.g.
antisense, disease-associated, etc.) either singly or in combi-
nation (Figure 1A). Once an individual ncRNA is selected, the
sequence and relevant annotations are displayed in a tabular
format (Figure 1B).
A BLAST tool allows users to query sequences of interest
against those present in the database.

CONTENT OF THE DATABASE
RNAdb contains more than 800 unique, known mammalian
ncRNAs. Including homologs, splice variants and precursor
forms, there are more than 2000 individual sequences listed.
Of the uniquely known ncRNAs in the database, around two-
thirds comprise miRNAs and snoRNAs. The rest are generally
much longer and while some of these have documented bio-
logical roles, most are transcripts of unknown function.
Altogether 36 mammalian organisms are represented within
the dataset but the majority of unique ncRNAs are either
murine and/or human.
miRNAs
Over 200 unique mammalian miRNAs are found within
RNAdb and were chiefly obtained from the miRNA registry
(38). While it is not our aim to duplicate this valuable resource,
we have included miRNAs here because they represent an
important population of potentially regulatory ncRNAs and
consequently fall within the scope of this database. In addition,
we have manually annotated the miRNAs to reflect recent
published results (30,40–43).
snoRNAs
More than 300 snoRNAs have been described. They fall into
two general classes, C/D box and H/ACA snoRNAs, which
guide ribose methylation and pseudo-uridylation of rRNAs,
respectively. Some snoRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific
manner and show complementarity to mRNAs rather than
rRNAs (44), pointing to possible roles in post-transcriptional
modification and regulation.
Disease-associated ncRNAs
Over 40 unique ncRNAs have been linked to diseases
ranging from malignancies to psychiatric illnesses and
neuro-developmental disorders. These include: miR-15 and
16, BCMS (B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia), TTY1
and 2 (gonadoblastoma), NCRMS (rhabdomyosarcoma),
BIC (ALV-induced B cell lymphoma), H19 (breast/colon/
bladder/Wilm’s tumor), MALAT-1 (non-small cell lung can-
cer), DISC2 (schizophrenia), SCA8 (spinocerebellar ataxia),
ST7OT1-4 (autism), IPW (Prader–Willi syndrome), LIT-1
(Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome), RMRP (cartilage hair
hypoplasia) and UBE3A antisense (Angelman syndrome).
Developmentally regulated ncRNAs
More than 40 ncRNAs show tissue-specific expression and/or
regulation during development. Recent examples include mul-
tiple miRNAs differentially expressed during brain develop-
ment and hematopoiesis (30,40), and others include Xist, 7H4,
BC1, BC200, BORG, Bsr, CIOR, MBII-13/52 and 85, Ntab,
NTT, tncb and Zim3.
Natural antisense ncRNAs
Natural antisense transcription is now recognized as being
much more common than previously thought, with recent
estimates indicating that there may be thousands of sense–
antisense pairs in the human genome (45). RNAdb includes
over 30 previously described antisense ncRNAs, a few exam-
ples of which are aHIF, Air, DISC2, EMX2OS, FGF antisense,
HFE antisense, HOXA11S, LIT1, Msx1 antisense and Nespas.
Expressed pseudogenes
The number of pseudogenes in the human genome has been
estimated at 20 000 (46), only a minority of which are
thought to be transcribed into ncRNAs (47). Here, we catalog
over 50 expressed pseudogenes. These include Makorin1-p1,
the disruption of which was recently shown to play a role in the
pathogenesis of a mouse mutant exhibiting polycystic kidneys
and bone deformity.
Imprinted ncRNAs
We have also found over 40 ncRNAs that are imprinted. Sev-
eral of these cluster together including IPW, PWCR1, UBE3A
antisense, PAR1 and PEG13 on human chromosome 15q11-
12, and PEG-11 antisense and MEG8 (on ovine chromosome
18). Many are natural antisense transcripts, such as (apart from
those above) LIT-1, Air, GNAS1 antisense, PEG8, Copg2IT1,
PEG1 antisense and Zim3.
Alternatively spliced ncRNAs
Over 20 ncRNAs are known to be alternatively spliced. Some
of these include BCMS, CIOR, DD3, DGCR5, Enox, G.B7,
Gas5, GTL2, NCRMS, Nespas, SCA8 and Tmevpg1.
Putative ncRNAs
In addition to the 800 unique known ncRNAs, RNAdb also
contains almost 20 000 putative ncRNAs. Approximately
15 000 of these were originally identified from over 60 000
high-quality largely full-length mouse cDNA clones annotated
by the FANTOM consortium (6). A further 2000 putative
ncRNAs were obtained from the H-Invitational database,
which contains over 20 000 validated gene candidates derived
from analysis of high-quality largely full-length human cDNA
clones (7). The human chromosome 7 annotation project has
described over 350 putative ncRNAs derived from computer-
based annotation in conjunction with extensive laboratory
experimentation, and these are also included among our
putative ncRNA dataset. Finally, using a computational
pipeline, we identified over 1100 putative antisense ncRNAs
(Supplementary Material 2), and these are also contained in
the database.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
To date, we have cataloged hundreds of known non-
infrastructural mammalian ncRNAs. This number quickly
stretches to thousands once the putative ncRNAs are taken
into account. While it has been proposed that many of these
ncRNAs function as components in a regulatory network (3,5),
D128 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, Database issue
in the majority of cases, virtually nothing is known about
their precise biological roles, tissue expression patterns and
significance. Elucidating the functional significance of these
transcripts must, therefore, become a priority. Until this is
done, we acknowledge the important caveats that some of
the RNAs classified here as ncRNAs may not have intrinsic
function, as in the case of SRG1 in yeast (48), and that some
may encode small proteins as recently described for the steroid
receptor RNA activator (49). Nonetheless, having a searchable
database such as RNAdb dedicated to non-infrastructural
ncRNAs will be a vital foundation for the emerging field of
RNomics as the future knowledge base grows. We are, there-
fore, setting up a regular database update schedule, and invite
researchers to submit new ncRNAs to RNAdb as they are
published. In the near future, we will be adding thousands
of novel putative ncRNAs that have arisen from the latest
round of analysis of the FANTOM cDNA libraries, as they
become publicly available.
POSTSCRIPT
At the time of submission, it came to our attention that a new
noncoding RNA database (NONCODE) had been released
online in the previous month. This database appears to
share a similar interest with ours but RNAdb has the following
advantages: (i) over 1100 putative antisense ncRNAs and
almost 20 000 putative ncRNAs identified in high-quality
murine and human cDNA libraries are included and annotated;
(ii) BLAST searches against the non-coding dataset can be
performed; and (iii) the database is available for download to
permit more thorough local bioinformatic analyses.
