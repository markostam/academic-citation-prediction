Abstract 
Climate feedbacks are estimated from fluctuations in the outgoing radiation budget from 
the latest version of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) nonscanner data. It 
appears, for the entire tropics, the observed outgoing radiation fluxes increase with the 
increase in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The observed behavior of radiation fluxes 
implies negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity. 
This is the opposite of the behavior of 11 atmospheric models forced by the same SSTs. 
Therefore, the models display much higher climate sensitivity than is inferred from 
ERBE, though it is difficult to pin down such high sensitivities with any precision. 
Results also show, the feedback in ERBE is mostly from shortwave radiation while the 
feedback in the models is mostly from longwave radiation. Although such a test does not 
distinguish the mechanisms, this is important since the inconsistency of climate 
feedbacks constitutes a very fundamental problem in climate prediction.

1. Introduction 
   The purpose of the present note is to inquire whether observations of the earth’s 
radiation imbalance can be used to infer feedbacks and climate sensitivity. Such an 
approach has, as we will see, some difficulties, but it appears that they can be overcome. 
This is important since most current estimates of climate sensitivity are based on global 
climate model (GCM) results, and these obviously need observational testing. 
   To see what one particular difficulty is, consider the following conceptual situation: 
We instantaneously double CO2. This will cause the characteristic emission level to rise 
to a colder level with an associated diminution of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). 
The resulting radiative imbalance is what is generally referred to as radiative forcing. 
However, the resulting warming will eventually eliminate the radiative imbalance as the 
system approaches equilibrium. The actual amount of warming associated with 
equilibration as well as the response time will depend on the climate feedbacks in the 
system. These feedbacks arise from the dependence of radiatively important substances 
like water vapor (which is a powerful greenhouse gas) and clouds (which are important 
for both infrared and visible radiation) on the temperature. If the feedbacks are positive, 
then both the equilibrium warming and the response time will increase; if they are 
negative, both will decrease. Simple calculations as well as GCM results suggest 
response times on the order of decades for positive feedbacks and years or less for 
negative feedbacks [Lindzen and Giannitsis, 1998, and references therein]. The main 
point of this example is to illustrate that the climate system tends to eliminate radiative 
imbalances with characteristic response times. 
   Now, in 2002–2004 several papers noted that there was interdecadal change in the 
 - 2 -
top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative balance associated with a warming between the 
1980's and 1990's [Chen et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002; Wielicki et al., 2002a, b; Cess 
and Udelhofen, 2003; Hatzidimitriou et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2004]. Chou and Lindzen 
[2005] inferred from the interdecadal changes in OLR and temperature that there was a 
strong negative feedback. However, this result was internally inconsistent since the 
persistence of the imbalance over a decade implied a positive feedback. A subsequent 
correction to the satellite data eliminated much of the decadal variation in the radiative 
balance [Wong et al., 2006]. 
   However, it also made clear that one could not readily use decadal variability in 
surface temperature to infer feedbacks from ERBE data. Rather one needs to look at 
temperature variations that are long compared to the time scales associated with the 
feedback processes, but short compared to the response time over which the system 
equilibrates. This is also important so as to unambiguously observe changes in the 
radiative budget that are responses to fluctuations in SST as opposed to changes in SST 
resulting from changes in the radiative budget; the latter will occur on the response time 
of the system. The primary feedbacks involving water vapor and clouds occur on time 
scales of days [Lindzen et al., 2001; Rodwell and Palmer, 2007], while response times for 
relatively strong negative feedbacks remain on the order of a year [Lindzen and 
Giannitsis, 1998, and references therein]. That said, it is evident that, because the system 
attempts to restore equilibrium, there will be a tendency to underestimate negative 
feedbacks relative to positive feedbacks that are associated with longer response times. 
 
2. Data and Analysis 
 - 3 -
   The observed data used in this study are the 16-year (1985–1999) monthly record of 
the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction, and the earth radiation budget from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment 
(ERBE) [Barkstrom, 1984] nonscanner edition 3 dataset. Note that the ERBE nonscanner 
data are the only stable long-term climate dataset based on broadband flux measurements, 
and they were recently altitude-corrected [Wong et al., 2006]. The data can provide 
reasonably reliable evidence of fluctuations in the anomalies of SST, OLR, and reflected 
shortwave radiation (SWR) from the tropical means (20°S–20°N); the anomalies are 
deseasonalized by the monthly means for the period of 1985 through 1989 for the 
purpose of comparison with climate models [Wielicki et al., 2002a, b]. The effect of land 
temperature (22% of the whole tropics) on the tropical radiation budget could not be 
taken into account in this study, due to limited satellite retrievals of surface temperature 
over the land [Chou and Lindzen, 2005]. 
   The anomalies include a semiannual signal due to the temporal aliasing effect that 
needs to be eliminated [Trenberth, 2002]. The relevant sampling error of the tropical 
monthly ERBE data is about 1.7 W m–2 for SWR and 0.4 W m–2 for OLR [Wielicki et al., 
2002a, b]. This spurious signal, particularly in the SWR, can be removed in a 36-day 
average, reducing the SWR error to the order of 0.3 W m–2. However, in this study, the 
36-day average was not applied because we wish to relate monthly SSTs to monthly 
ERBE TOA fluxes. Instead, the moving average with a 7-month smoother was used for 
the SWR anomalies alone; however, we will see that the smoothing does not much affect 
the main results. With respect to instrumental stability, the nonscanner records agree 
relatively well with the scanner records for the period from 1985 to 1989, but no longer 
 - 4 -
agree with them as well for the later period (difference of up to 3 W m–2) [Wong et al., 
2006]. The fundamental difference between the two types of radiometers comes from the 
fact that, while the nonsanner views the entire hemisphere of radiation, the scanner views 
radiance from a single direction and estimates the hemispheric emission or reflection 
[Wielicki et al., 2002a]. It is difficult to quantify possible influences due to this difference, 
but the present study requires only short term stability and this may be less affected. 
   The analysis was also made for the model TOA fluxes. The atmospheric model 
intercomparison projects (AMIP) program for the 4th Assessment Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4) provides model results for 
atmospheric GCMs forced by observed SSTs. AMIP also provides the equilibrium 
climate sensitivity for the models included [IPCC, 2007]. 
   The next obvious question is whether fluctuations with the time scales associated with 
feedback processes exist in the observed data and models. Figure 1 shows that such 
fluctuations (ΔFlux) are amply available in OLR and SWR, although data are not 
currently available in some periods in 1993 and 1999. However, it is possible that many 
of the very small fluctuations are simply noise. Restricting oneself to fluctuations in SST 
(ΔT) which exceed 0.2 K still leaves nine cases in the available data (red and blue lines in 
Fig. 1a). Note that appreciable fluctuations of the anomalies are due to El Niño events (in 
1982/83 1986/87, 1991/92, and 1997/98), La Niña events (in 1988/90), and Pinatubo 
eruption (in 1991) [Wielicki et al., 2002a; Wong et al., 2006]. 
   Figure 2 compares estimates of net ΔFlux/ΔT for intervals for which ΔT exceeded 0.1 
K; the net flux is calculated for OLR+SWR. Results are shown both for 11 AMIP models, 
and for the ERBE data. ERBE has a positive ΔFlux/ΔT, whereas all models have a 
 - 5 -
negative ΔFlux/ΔT. Table 1 compares net ΔFlux/ΔT for intervals for which ΔT exceeded 
0.1, 0.2 K,…, for 3, 5, and 7 month time smoothing, for all monthly intervals. We see that 
all provide essentially the same result, but that scatter is significantly reduced by using 
threshold 0.2 K without time smoothing. One may take ΔFlux/ΔT with one month 
intervals, and secure more than hundred cases (Table 1). However, unless we confine ∆T 
to exceed 0.1 K, the inclusion of what is essentially noise leads to an increase in scatter, 
and statistically insignificant ΔFlux/ΔT (the opposite negative values in Table 1). In 
addition, based on the known uncertainty of ERBE data, it is expected that uncertainty in 
∆Flux/∆T for ∆T ≥ 0.2 K is up to 1.5 and 2 W m–2 K–1 for the SW and LW fluxes, 
respectively. That said, the opposite signal between ERBE and the models is hardly 
attributable to observational errors. Note that we will next show that ΔFlux/ΔT is a 
measure of the feedback factor for the climate system. 
   Following Chou and Lindzen [2005] and Lindzen et al. [2001], we use the following 
equation to relate ΔFlux/ΔT to equilibrium climate sensitivity. In the nonfeedback climate, 
climate sensitivity is defined as the response of temperature ∆T0 to an external forcing 
∆Q: 
 
,00 QGT Δ=Δ     (1) 
 
where G0 is a nonfeedback gain. The mean outgoing longwave (LW) radiation in the 
whole tropics is approximately 255 W m–2 [Barkstrom, 1984], and is equivalent to an 
effective emitting temperature of 259 K. Thus G0 is calculated by the inverse of the 
derivative of the Planck function with respect to the temperature at 259 K; G0 ≈ 0.25 W–1 
 - 6 -
m2 K. For a doubling of CO2 (∆Q ≈ 3.7 W m–2), ∆T0 is ~0.925 K (= 0.25 × 3.7). 
   In the presence of feedback processes, an additional forcing proportional to the 
response ∆T (i.e., F∆T) is provided to ∆Q in Eq. (1). The response is now 
 
0 ( )T G Q F TΔ = Δ + Δ ,    (2) 
 
and 
 
,

Δ=Δ     (3) 
 
where f = G0F is the feedback factor. The net feedback is positive for 0 < f < 1, and 
negative for f < 0. The feedback parameter F is –ΔFlux/ΔT, assuming the same incoming 
radiation in the system. The negative sign pertains because increased outgoing flux 
means energy loss. For example, with ΔT = 0.2 K and ΔFlux = 0.9 W m–2, F is –4.5 W 
m–2 K–1 (= –0.9/0.2) that is equivalent to f = –1.1, resulting in ∆T of ~0.5 K for a 
doubling of CO2 in Eq. (3). Namely, given F = –4.5 W m–2 K–1, climate sensitivity is 
about a half of that for the nonfeedback condition. On the other hand, negative ΔFlux/ΔΤ 
is equivalent to climate sensitivity for a doubling of CO2 higher than 1 K. All models 
agree as to positive feedback, and all models disagree very sharply with the observations. 
However, it is difficult to accurately determine sensitivity from ΔFlux/ΔΤ from the 
models. Varying ΔFlux/ΔΤ values even slightly by 1 W m–2 K–1, which can simply be a 
measurement error [Wong et al., 2006], and climate sensitivity for a doubling of CO2 may 
 - 7 -
have any value higher than 1 K. For example, the 2 K to 4.5 K is the likelihood range of 
climate sensitivity in IPCC-AR4, which corresponds to ΔFlux/ΔΤ = –2.3 to –3.3 W m–2 
K–1. Similar explanation on why climate sensitivity is so unpredictable can be also found 
in Roe and Baker [2007]. 
   When considering LW and SW fluxes separately, F is replaced by FLW + FSW. In the 
observed ΔOLR/ΔT, the nonfeedback change of 4 W m–2 K–1 is included. Also 
ΔSWR/ΔT needs to be balanced with ΔOLR/ΔT. From the consideration, FLW = –
ΔOLR/ΔT + 4 and FSW = –ΔSWR/ΔΤ – 4. In the case of no SW feedback (FSW = 0), 
ΔOLR/ΔT less than 4 W m–2 K–1 represents positive feedback; ΔOLR/ΔT more than 4 W 
m–2 K–1 represents negative feedback; ΔOLR/ΔT less than 0 W m–2 K–1 represents infinite 
feedback, which is physically unreal. 
 
3. Concluding Remarks 
   In Figure 3, we show 3 panels. We see that ERBE and model results differ 
substantially. In panels a and b, we evaluate Equation (3) using ΔFlux for only OLR and 
only SWR. The curves are for the condition assuming no SW feedback and assuming no 
LW feedback in panels a and b, respectively. In panel a, model results fall on the curve 
given by Equation (3), because the model average of SW feedbacks is almost zero. In 
panel b, models with smaller LW feedbacks are closer to the curve for no LW feedback; 
the model results would lie on the curve assuming positive LW feedback. When in panel 
c we consider the total flux (i.e., LW + SW), model results do lie on the theoretically 
expected curve. Looking at Figure 3, we note several important features: 
1) The models display much higher climate sensitivity than is inferred from ERBE. 
 - 8 -
2) The (negative) feedback in ERBE is mostly from SW while the (positive) feedback in 
the models is mostly from OLR. 
3) The theoretical relation between ΔF/ΔT and sensitivity is very flat for sensitivities 
greater than 2°C. Thus, the data does not readily pin down such sensitivities. This was 
the basis for the assertion by Roe and Baker [2007] that determination of climate 
sensitivity was almost impossible [Allen and Frame, 2007]. However, this assertion 
assumes a large positive feedback. Indeed, Fig. 3c suggests that models should have a 
range of sensitivities extending from about 1.5°C to infinite sensitivity (rather than 
5°C as commonly asserted), given the presence of spurious positive feedback. 
However, response time increases with increasing sensitivity [Lindzen and Giannitsis, 
1998], and models were probably not run sufficiently long to realize their full 
sensitivity. For sensitivities less than 2°C, the data readily distinguish different 
sensitivities, and ERBE data appear to demonstrate a climate sensitivity of about 
0.5°C which is easily distinguished from sensitivities given by models. 
   Note that while TOA flux data from ERBE are sufficient to determine feedback 
factors, this data do not specifically identify mechanisms. Thus, the small OLR feedback 
from ERBE might represent the absence of any OLR feedback; it might also result from 
the cancellation of a possible positive water vapor feedback due to increased water vapor 
in the upper troposphere [Soden et al., 2005] and a possible negative iris cloud feedback 
involving reduced upper level cirrus clouds [Lindzen et al., 2001]. With respect to SW 
feedbacks, it is currently claimed that model SW feedbacks are largely associated with 
the behavior of low level clouds [Bony et al., 2006, and references therein]. Whether this 
is the case in nature cannot be determined from ERBE TOA observations. However, 
 - 9 -
more recent data from CALIOP do offer height resolution, and we are currently studying 
such data to resolve the issue of what, in fact, is determining SW feedbacks. Finally, it 
should be noted that our analysis has only considered the tropics. Following Lindzen et al. 
[2001], allowing for sharing this tropical feedback with neutral higher latitudes could 
reduce the negative feedback factor by about a factor of two. This would lead to an 
equilibrium sensitivity that is 2/3 rather than 1/2 of the non-feedback value. This, of 
course, is still a small sensitivity.
