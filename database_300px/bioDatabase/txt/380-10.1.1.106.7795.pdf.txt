ABSTRACT
The National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/) provides a
non-redundant collection of sequences representing
genomic data, transcripts and proteins. Although the
goal is to provide a comprehensive dataset repres-
enting the complete sequence information for any
given species, the database pragmatically includes
sequence data that are currently publicly available
in the archival databases. The database incorporates
data fromover 2400 organisms and includes over one
million proteins representing significant taxonomic
diversity spanning prokaryotes, eukaryotes and
viruses. Nucleotide and protein sequences are expli-
citly linked, and the sequences are linked to other
resources including the NCBI Map Viewer and
Gene. Sequences are annotated to include coding
regions, conserved domains, variation, references,
names, database cross-references, and other fea-
tures using a combined approach of collaboration
and other input from the scientific community, auto-
mated annotation, propagation from GenBank and
curation by NCBI staff.
INTRODUCTION
RefSeq is a public database of nucleotide and protein
sequences with corresponding feature and bibliographic anno-
tation. The RefSeq database is built and distributed by the
NCBI, a division of the National Library of Medicine located
at the US National Institutes of Health. NCBI makes RefSeq
publicly available, at no cost, over the internet via FTP, Entrez
query (1), Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (2,3)
programs, and incorporation in a wide range of NCBI
resources.
NCBI builds RefSeq from the sequence data available in the
archival database GenBank (4), which is a comprehensive
public repository of sequences submitted to, and exchanged
among, GenBank in the US, the EMBLData Library in the UK
and the DNA Data Bank of Japan. In addition, the annotated
RefSeq record and/or supplementary information may be pro-
vided by multiple collaborations established with nomencla-
ture groups, model organism databases and other facets of the
scientific community. RefSeq records indicate the source
GenBank data, include references and annotations relevant
to the gene, transcript and protein, and indicate curation
with attribution to the curation group.
The RefSeq collection is unique in providing a curated, non-
redundant, explicitly linked nucleotide and protein database
representing significant taxonomic diversity. Genomic and
protein sequence datasets are provided for the majority of
organisms included; transcript records are currently provided
for a subset of the eukaryotic collection. The RefSeq database
provides a critical foundation for integrating sequence, genetic
and functional information, and is used internationally as a
standard for genome annotation. The collection is curated on
an ongoing basis by collaborating groups and by NCBI staff.
Sequence records are presented in a standard format and are
subject to computational validation.
DISTINCTION FROM GENBANK
The RefSeq collection is derived from the primary submis-
sions available in GenBank. GenBank is a redundant archival
database that represents sequence information generated at
different times, and may represent several alternate views
of the protein, names or other information. In contrast, RefSeq
represents a nearly non-redundant collection that is a synthesis
and summary of available information, and represents the
‘current’ view of the sequence information, names and other
annotations.
RefSeq records can be distinguished from GenBank records
by the format of the accession series. RefSeq accession num-
bers are formatted as two alphabetic characters, followed by an

underscore (‘_’), optionally followed by four alphabetic char-
acters (specific to the NZ_ prefix), followed by six, eight or
nine numerals. GenBank accessions never include an under-
score. Different alphabetic prefixes have implied meaning in
terms of both the process of generation and the type of mole-
cule represented. A full definition of the RefSeq accession
numbers is available on the RefSeq Web site (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/key.html#accessions).
GROWTH
The RefSeq database continues to grow in pace with the large-
scale genome and cDNA sequencing projects (see Table 1). As
new complete genome assemblies become available, they are
incorporated into the RefSeq collection. Most organisms are
represented in the collection only after some genomic
sequence data (nuclear, plastid, mitochondrial or other geno-
mic molecules) becomes available; however, transcript and
protein records may be provided for a subset of euka-
ryotic model organisms prior to the availability of genomic
sequence data.
ANNOTATION
Annotation of RefSeq records originates from several sources
including the original GenBank submission, collaborating
groups, NCBI computational analysis, user feedback and man-
ual curation at NCBI. For example, collaboration supports
the RefSeq representation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, which
are directly contributed by the Saccharomyces Genome Data-
base (SGD)(5), FlyBase (6) and The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR), respectively. Similarly, the entire viral
RefSeq collection is reviewed and curated by the NCBI
Viral Genome Advisors group. See the RefSeq Collaborators
page for more information about contributions from colla-
borators (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/collaborators.
html). All RefSeq records include explicit cross-links between
the nucleotide and protein cognates and to Entrez Gene (7),
which provides gene-oriented access to the RefSeq collection.
Additional links, annotated as ‘db_xref’ notations, are pro-
vided on some records to organism-specific genome resources
such as Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) (8) or FlyBase.
For other species, including Apis mellifera (honey bee),
Gallus gallus (chicken), Homo sapiens (human), Mus muscu-
lus (mouse) and Rattus norvegicus (rat), genome annotation
is provided by a NCBI computational process that utilizes
transcript alignments, protein support and a hidden Markov
model (HMM) ab initio prediction algorithm (see the NCBI
Handbook; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?
db=Books). Genomic RefSeq records that are annotated by
this process represent genes, transcripts and proteins, and
include additional feature annotation to represent STS
markers. The available RefSeq transcript dataset, with the
‘NM_’ accession prefix, is an important reagent in this anno-
tation pipeline.
Comprehensive representation of the proteins, explicitly
linked to a RefSeq nucleotide record, is a major focus of
the RefSeq project. The goal is to represent the full-length
protein product; however, partial protein products are repre-
sented for some genomes when partial protein annotation is
contributed by a collaborator or when proteins are predicted
from incomplete genome sequence data. Proteins are anno-
tated by computation and curation. Conserved domains are
calculated by an automatic process using data maintained in
the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (9); this anno-
tation provides hints about possible function. Likewise, varia-
tion features that are located in the coding region are
automatically calculated from data available in the NCBI
dbSNP database (10). Additional features including Enzyme
Commission (EC) numbers, other landmark regions of the
protein sequence and references may be added by curation
either by an external collaborator or by NCBI staff.
Transcript records are provided for a subset of eukaryotic
species, including those in the Chordata taxonomic lineage, to
represent protein-coding sequences, transcribed pseudogenes,
ribosomal RNAs and other small RNAs. Annotation results
from a mixture of automated and curatorial analysis. Variation
features are calculated automatically from data in the dbSNP
database, and the nucleotide region corresponding to the anno-
tated protein conserved domains are also provided auto-
matically (as a miscellaneous feature, or ‘misc_feat’). Other
features, such as polyadenylation signals and sites, alternate
transcription start sites and RNA editing sites, are provided
by curation.
CURATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
RefSeq sequences are validated to confirm the following:
(i) accurate nucleotide-to-protein sequence correspondence;
(ii) valid ASN.1 format and (iii) for species supported by
collaboration with official nomenclature groups, current
preferred name and symbol designations. Validation of map
location is available for species that are annotated via the
NCBI annotation pipeline.
NCBI staff review and manually modify a subset of the
RefSeq collection including those provided for viruses,
some bacteria, mammals and some additional species. The
goal of this manual curation is to provide accurate and full-
length sequence data, to ensure accurate sequence-to-gene
associations, to expand the collection by adding previously
unrepresented genes and/or alternate splice products, and to
provide additional feature annotation to represent mature pep-
tide products, regions of interest and/or to highlight less fre-
quent biological events such as non-AUG initiation sites (11)
or selenoproteins (12). The curation status is annotated on
RefSeq records, as a COMMENT feature; the status terms
used include model, predicted, provisional, inferred, validated
and reviewed, with the latter two indicating that sequence-
level curation has taken place. Curation status terms are docu-
mented on the RefSeqWeb site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
RefSeq/key.html#status).
Several processes are used to identify records that will ben-
efit most from staff review. For instance, records targeted for
review include those that differ relative to available genomic

sequence, those with significant protein length variation com-
pared to homologous groups calculated by the NCBI Homo-
loGene resource (13), and those for which there are no related
proteins other than the GenBank record used to construct the
RefSeq. Several additional tests for transcript and protein
quality are in place but are not enumerated here. In addition,
review is based on user feedback that identifies additional data
or errors. We welcome user feedback to help maintain and
improve the RefSeq collection. A feedback form is provided
online, or users can contact the main NCBI Help Desk (see
Table 2).
RETRIEVING DATA
The RefSeq collection can be accessed multiple ways at NCBI,
including by Entrez query, BLAST, FTP, and links provided
from NCBI databases and resources (see Table 2).
Entrez query
RefSeq results are included in the results returned when per-
forming a global query of the Entrez databases from the NCBI
or Entrez homepage. Returned results can be restricted to
include only RefSeq records by going to the homepage of
the nucleotide or protein database and either using the Entrez
Limits page to select ‘Only from RefSeq’ or adding one of the
RefSeq-specific property restrictions directly to the entered
text query. For example, a query to retrieve all RefSeq nucleo-
tide records that include the name ‘BRCA1’ somewhere in
the record is formatted as BRCA1 AND srcdb_refseq[prop].
The RefSeq Web site provides definitions of the available
property restrictions (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/
key.html#query).
Entrez queries from the Entrez home page, where it is pos-
sible to query against all of the Entrez databases at once, will
also return results to the Entrez Gene and Genomes (14) data-
bases, which are both components of the RefSeq project.
Entrez Gene integrates gene-specific annotation from RefSeq
records with other sources of information, and thus provides a
gene-oriented view of data about genes (7). When there is
sequence for a complete genome or chromosome, the data
are also included in the Entrez Genome database, which pro-
vides multiple tools to display and analyze the information.
BLAST and BLink
RefSeq records are included in the main BLAST nr databases
and are also made available in genome-specific BLAST
database collections (listed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST/). Hits to RefSeq records can be immediately
identified by the distinct format of the accession numbers.
BLAST nr results can be configured to show only those
hits to the RefSeq collection by entering the Entrez property
query on the format page (e.g. srcdb_refseq[prop]).
RefSeq records are also included in the pre-computed
BLAST analysis that is done to provide Entrez links to related
sequences (nucleotide or protein) and to BLink, a visualization
tool for the related protein sequences dataset. The BLink inter-
face includes an option to show only RefSeq proteins.
FTP
The complete RefSeq collection is made available for anon-
ymous FTP as bi-monthly releases in conjunction with daily
and cumulative updates between the release cycles. The
RefSeq release is structured to provide access to the full
RefSeq collection or to a portion of the collection organized
by main taxonomic categories (e.g. plant, viral, vertebrate_
mammalian) or molecules of interest (e.g. organelle, plasmid).
Documentation includes an indication of files and sequences
provided, sequences that have been removed since the pre-
vious release, and a full description of the release structure and
content. Announcements about large changes, problems and
the availability of a RefSeq release are emailed to the refseq-
announce email list (see Table 2). Additional FTP data is
provided for some organisms of interest, including the tran-
script and protein dataset for human, mouse and rat. Users may
be interested in subscribing to refseq-announce@ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov to receive information about the RefSeq releases
and planned modifications as they occur over time.
Links
Multiple NCBI databases and resources include links to
RefSeq records. Links to RefSeq records can be found in
many Entrez databases and resources including Gene,
UniGene, HomoloGene, Map Viewer, UniSTS.
