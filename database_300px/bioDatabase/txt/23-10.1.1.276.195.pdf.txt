ABSTRACT
We developed OligoCalc as a web-accessible,
client-based computational engine for reporting
DNA and RNA single-stranded and double-
stranded properties, including molecular weight,
solution concentration, melting temperature,
estimated absorbance coefficients, inter-molecular
self-complementarity estimation and intra-
molecular hairpin loop formation. OligoCalc has a
familiar ‘calculator’ look and feel, making it
readily understandable and usable. OligoCalc incor-
porates three common methods for calculating
oligonucleotide-melting temperatures, including a
nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model for melting
temperature. Since it first came online in 1997, there
have been more than 900 000 accesses of OligoCalc
from nearly 200 000 distinct hosts, excluding search
engines. OligoCalc is available at http://basic.north
western.edu/biotools/OligoCalc.html, with links to
the full source code, usage patterns and statistics
at that link as well.
INTRODUCTION
Even prior to PCR, DNA oligonucleotides were used
extensively in molecular biology as primers and as probes.
With the availability of completely sequenced genomes,
various genomic and array technologies including DNA
microarrays and bead arrays have made oligonucleotides
even more important reagents. OligoCalc provides a
convenient web interface for calculating the physical
properties of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides including
melting temperature, molecular weight, %GC content
and absorbance coeﬃcient for a given oligonucleotide
sequence. The recent interest and availability of biological
applications for siRNAs has resulted in the addition of
RNA oligonucleotides as common laboratory reagents,
and OligoCalc can be used to calculate the properties of
single-stranded and double-stranded RNA as well as
DNA. OligoCalc provides the results of three common
melting temperature calculations. Performing these
calculations are all straightforward—enter the nucleotide
sequence into a textbox, and hit return or click on the
‘Calculate’ button. In addition to these calculations,
the user can enter absorbance readings to calculate the
concentration of the oligonucleotide in ng/mmol and
micrograms present in 1ml of solution, and enter the
predicted salt and/or primer concentrations in the ﬁnal
hybridization solution to more accurately predict the
melting temperature. The user can also select options
such as single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA
molecules (ssDNA is the default), and the user can
select from more than seventy 50 and 30 chemical
modiﬁcations that reﬁne the molecular weight and
absorbance calculations for oligonucleotides with those
modiﬁcations. Other options include the swapping of the
entered sequence for its complement, submitting the
sequence to the NCBI BLAST site, calculating self-
complementarity between two identical oligonucleotide
molecules, and calculating potential intra-molecular
hairpin loop formation.
USING OLIGOCALC TO CALCULATE THE
PROPERTIES OF OLIGONUCLEOTIDES
OligoCalc has a familiar ‘calculator’ interface and the
basic properties can be calculated by pasting or entering
the sequence followed by one of the following actions:
clicking out of the sequence box, entering a ‘tab’, hitting
‘return’ or clicking ‘Calculate’. OligoCalc will use the
currently entered sequence, selected options and entered
conditions to calculate the length, molecular weight,
estimated absorbance at 260 nm, the micromolar concen-
tration and micrograms of oligonucleotide present in a
1ml solution with an absorbance of one for the
sequence entered. The calculator is available at the
URL http://basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/OligoCalc.
html and loading that URL in a browser will display
the interface shown in Figure 1.
Once the user has entered a sequence, several additional
options can be selected or entered. The absorbance at
260 nm (A260) can be entered for the oligonucleotide, and

will result in the calculation of the micromolar concentra-
tion of oligonucleotide as well as the micrograms of the
oligonucleotide present in a 1ml solution with that
absorbance. The millimolar concentration of salt [Naþ]
can be entered and will adjust the salt adjusted and nearest
neighbor melting temperature calculations. The default
value is 50mM. The nanomolar concentration of primer
in the hybridization solution can also be entered and
will adjust the nearest neighbor melting temperature.
The composition of the oligonucleotide (DNA or RNA,

single-stranded or double-stranded) can be selected and
will change many of the calculations, although the
absorption coeﬃcients are only accurate for single-
stranded oligonucleotides. There are a number of 50 and
30 modiﬁcations that can be selected, and will change the
molecular weight and in some cases the absorbance
coeﬃcient for the oligonucleotide. The entry of IUPAC
codes are also supported (for instance W for A or T) and
results in a range of values being reported for melting
temperature, %GC content, molecular weight, concentra-
tion and micrograms present in a 1ml solution with a
A260 of 1, with the range representing the highest
and lowest values possible for the set of possible
oligonucleotides.
Clicking the ‘Swap Strands’ button swaps the entered
strand for its reverse complement, and updates the
properties of the oligonucleotide based on the new
strand sequence. Note that if the ‘dsDNA’ or ‘dsRNA’
molecule type has been selected, swapping strands has no
eﬀect on the overall properties, since both strands are
already taken into account by the calculations.
Clicking the ‘mfold button results in a new window that
posts to the mfold web server (1,2) with likely hairpin and
self-complementary areas highlighted.
A ﬁnal option available is ‘BLAST’, which opens a new
window and posts the sequence entered to the NCBI
BLAST page and starts a blastn analysis of the entered
sequence against the current set of non-redundant
sequences (nr) available at the NCBI (3), with ﬁltering
for low-complexity sequences enabled.
There is also considerable documentation available,
including a page of chemical modiﬁcations, including the
chemical names for the common synonyms and links to
the structures of the modiﬁcations, when available. This
page is available at http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/
biotools/OligoCalcModiﬁcations.html.
AVAILABLE CALCULATIONS
Molecular weight calculations are based on the molecular
weights available from Aldrich Chemicals, St. Louis, MO,
USA. The absorbance coeﬃcients and calculations
are done as described in Molecular Cloning, a Lab
Manual (4). The basic melting temperature calculation
(5,6) is provided as a baseline for comparison, and is the
least preferred method. The salt adjustment calculation
is performed as described in Howley et al. (7) and the
nearest neighbor thermodynamic calculations are done
essentially as described by Breslauer et al. (8), but using
the values published by Sugimoto et al. (9). RNA
thermodynamic properties were taken from Xia et al.
(10). The equations and the values used in all calcula-
tions are posted at the OligoCalc website, http://basic.
northwestern.edu/biotools/.
Although OligoCalc is compatible with version
4 browsers (IE 4 and Netscape 4), browsers using either
the Gecko or KHTML engines, or Internet Explorer 5.5
or higher are preferred. This includes Mozilla, Netscape 7,
Camino, Safari, Konqueror or FireFox browsers.
JavaScript must be enabled in the client browser for
OligoCalc to work.
Available melting temperature method comparisons
The basic melting temperature is the least preferred
method, however is perhaps the most often employed
method for calculating melting temperature by bench
scientists. OligoCalc was designed to give researchers an
easy tool for ﬁnding and comparing melting temperatures
using more accurate calculations. For oligonucleotides
between 8 and 40 nt, the nearest neighbor method is
the preferred method (8–12). Note that the equations and
derived parameters were obtained using 14–20 mers,
so this method is the most accurate for oligonucleotides
of this length. A comparison of these data sets and
recommendations were recently published (13) and
implemented as a web server (14), and predominantly
agree with the methods we have chosen. For longer
sequences, or for oligonucleotides with base substitutions
or modiﬁcations, the salt adjusted melting temperature
calculation is the preferred method. Please note that these
calculations are only estimates and many other factors
can aﬀect the melting temperature, including detergents,
presence of other counter ions, solvents (ethanol for
instance), formamide, etc.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The current utility of OligoCalc was aided by the initial
prototype created by Eugene Buehler at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical School which is still available at http://
www.bioinformatics.org/JaMBW/3/1/9/index.html, the
eﬀorts of Qing Cao while she was a research associate at
Northwestern, the monomer structures and molecular
weights provided by Dr Bob Somers while at Glen
Research Corporation. The initial requirements for
OligoCalc came from a discussion with Dr Jim Kaput
while he was the director of the Biotechnology Core
Facility at Northwestern. The RNA calculations were a
result of very helpful conversations with Dr Suzanne
Kennedy at Qiagen, the ﬂuorescent tags and options,
along with the properties of the modiﬁed bases were
requested and provided by Dr Regina Bichlmaier at
metabion GmbH. I would also like to thank the reviewers,
who made many substantial and insightful suggestions that
dramatically improved this manuscript as well as the
documentation and features available through OligoCalc.
Finally, OligoCalc users have identiﬁed bugs and provided
numerous suggestions and feature requests over the years.
