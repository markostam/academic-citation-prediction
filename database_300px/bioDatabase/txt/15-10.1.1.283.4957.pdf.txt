ABSTRACT
A database of coexpressed gene sets can provide
valuable information for a wide variety of experi-
mental designs, such as targeting of genes for
functional identification, gene regulation and/or
protein–protein interactions. Coexpressed gene
databases derived from publicly available GeneChip
data are widely used in Arabidopsis research, but
platforms that examine coexpression for higher
mammals are rather limited. Therefore, we have
constructed a new database, COXPRESdb
(coexpressed gene database) (http://coxpresdb.
hgc.jp), for coexpressed gene lists and networks in
human and mouse. Coexpression data could be
calculated for 19 777 and 21 036 genes in human and
mouse, respectively, by using the GeneChip data
in NCBI GEO. COXPRESdb enables analysis of
the four types of coexpression networks: (i) highly
coexpressed genes for every gene, (ii) genes with
the same GO annotation, (iii) genes expressed in the
same tissue and (iv) user-defined gene sets. When
the networks became too big for the static picture
on the web in GO networks or in tissue networks,
we used Google Maps API to visualize them
interactively. COXPRESdb also provides a view
to compare the human and mouse coexpression
patterns to estimate the conservation between the
two species.
INTRODUCTION
Gene coexpression provides key information to under-
stand living systems because coexpressed genes are often
involved in the same or related biological pathways (1).
Coexpression data are now used for a wide variety of
experimental designs, such as gene targeting, regulatory
investigations and/or identiﬁcation of potential partners in
protein–protein interactions (PPIs) (2,3). Large-scale gene
expression data are required to obtain reliable coexpres-
sion information. DNA microarray data represent one
of the most abundant sources of gene expression data,
which are now stored in public gene expression reposi-
tories (4–6). Therefore, it would be an appropriate time to
establish a secondary database for coexpressed genes,
using the large amount of publicly available DNA
microarray data.
In the Arabidopsis ﬁeld, several coexpression databases
have been constructed and are widely used by researchers
(7–12). On the other hand, mammalian coexpression
information is rather limited because there is no estab-
lished mammalian database. For example, genevestigator
(for mouse and rat) (12) provides a sophisticated interface
to check gene expression patterns using Java technology,
but the coexpression data can only be obtained for the
query pair of genes, i.e. information on coexpressed gene
networks is not available. SymAtlas (for human, mouse
and rat) (10) uses an advanced search interface and
yields sets of coexpressed genes, but it does not provide
a quantitative measure of the coexpression strength.
Here we report a new database, COXPRESdb
(coexpressed gene database), which provides the
coexpressed gene networks and the coexpressed gene
lists ordered by the strength of coexpression for human
and mouse. COXPRESdb provides four types of
coexpressed gene networks: (i) highly coexpressed genes,
(ii) genes with the same GO annotation, (iii) genes
expressed in the same tissue and (iv) user-deﬁned gene
sets. COXPRESdb also prepares a cross-species view to
compare the coexpression networks in human and mouse
because conserved coexpression patterns may enhance
the reliability of the coexpressed network and can be used

to identify possible PPIs more eﬀectively (13). Notably,
the known PPIs in HPRD (14) are also shown in the
coexpression networks.
DATABASE CONTENTS
COXPRESdb contains the coexpressed gene networks for
40 813 genes (19 777 for human and 21 036 for mouse),
1820 GO terms and 63 human tissues. All expression data
for this database are based on the Aﬀymetrix GeneChip
(Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array and Mouse
Genome 430 2.0 Array), information on which has been
released by NCBI GEO (4).
COXPRESdb mainly consists of three types of pages:
gene page, GO network page and tissue-speciﬁc network
page. Representative usages of these pages are described in
Examples 1 and 2 below.
The gene page is the central page, which is constructed for
every gene deﬁned by NCBI Entrez (15) regardless of the
existence of expression data. The gene page is composed of
three sections: (i) functional annotation, (ii) gene coexpres-
sion and (iii) gene expression. The names of each part are
highlighted by green bars on the gene page (Figure 1C).
Each gene page has the URL, such as http://
coxpresdb.hgc.jp/data/gene/(EntrezGeneID).html, and thus
the external database can be directly linked to this page.
(i) The functional annotation section provides func-
tional gene annotations obtained from NCBI (15), GO
(16) and KEGG (17), as well as protein subcellular
localization predicted by WoLF PSORT (18). (ii) The gene
coexpression section provides the coexpressed gene net-
work(s) relevant to this gene. The gene page lists the
20 most highly coexpressed genes based on expression
pattern similarity (Figure 1C). Only the top 20 genes are
shown because the expression similarity rapidly decreases
after the top 20 genes, on average (data not shown), and
a large number of elements in a single network are
diﬃcult to see on a single web page. A list of the top 300
coexpressed genes is also available to ﬁnd any other
related genes, and thus the user can draw the network
containing more genes with a network drawing tool
provided by COXPRESdb. The details of the coexpression
can be seen by following the links to the ‘coexpression
detail’ in Figure 1C. To focus on the coexpression network
for each tissue, tissue-speciﬁc network pages are available
(see Example 1 and Figure 1C and D). (iii) The gene
expression section shows the gene expression pattern(s)
of the corresponding probeset(s). The tissue-speciﬁc gene
expression pattern is also shown.
To compare the gene information for orthologous gene
sets, ortholog pages are prepared in which the information
in the gene page for human and that from the correspond-
ing mouse gene page are presented in parallel. To identify
the homologous gene set, we used HomoloGene (15) data,
in which 16 981 gene sets were deﬁned.
A GO network page is constructed for each GO term
(16). The 30 most highly coexpressed genes are selected,
and their networks are drawn in parallel views for human
and mouse (Figure 2C). The GO networks as well as
tissue-speciﬁc networks are constructed based on the same
coexpression data as presented in the gene page, and
the diﬀerence is in the selection of genes to be drawn.
There are 6623 GO terms, and the networks are depicted
as 1820 GO terms. The other terms are not considered
because they have no highly coexpressed gene pairs with
mutual rank (MR) <50 (see DATA SOURCES AND
CALCULATION for MR).
The tissue-speciﬁc network page is constructed for
63 human tissues using the annotation of gene expression
in HPRD (14) (Figure 1D). The global picture of
a coexpressed gene network in a tissue is too large to be
visualized in a single picture on a static page, and
therefore we employed Google Maps API (Application
Programming Interface, http://www.google.com/apis/
maps/) to interactively navigate the huge coexpression
networks.
Example 1: functional estimation of the gene,ACTR3
The human gene ACTR3 served as a model to describe the
functionalities of COXPRESdb. This protein is one of
the seven subunits of the Arp2/3 complex that regulates
F-actin formation at lamellipodial protrusions (19).
(The following steps are also shown as a tutorial in
COXPRESdb at http://coxpresdb.hgc.jp/help/tutorial/
1.html.)
(1) Search ‘actin related protein 3’ as a keyword, using
the search form to the right of the title logo on
the top page (Figure 1A). In the initial setting, the
human annotations are searched, but this can be
changed by the toggle switch under the search box.
The BLAST search against COXPRESdb is also
provided as a search page.
(2) As a result, ACTR3 is found in the list, and the user
can see its gene page by clicking the ‘symbol’ of
ACTR3 (Figure 1B).
(3) In this example, ACTR3 is surrounded by genes
for actin regulation (Figure 1C). ACTR2, ARPC2,
ARPC3 and ARPC5 are other components of the
Arp2/3 complex, which are supported by PPIs
(red edges), and TMOD3 and CAPZA1 encode
capping proteins at the pointed-end and the
barbed-end of F-actin with supports from homologs
(orange edges). In short, this coexpression network
clearly reﬂects the direct functional partners of
ACTR3.
In the expression section, the tissue-speciﬁc gene
expression pattern indicates that this gene is expressed
in immune system organs, veins and oral tissues,
as supported by four of the ﬁve GeneChip probesets
(with the exception of 239170_at probe). To consult the
coexpressed gene networks in these expressed tissues,
the coexpressed gene networks for foetus and neutrophil
are provided. Click ‘Neutrophil’ as a representative of
the immune system organs.
(4) On the tissue-speciﬁc network page, ACTR3 is
automatically placed at the centre of the window
and highlighted with a yellow symbol (Figure 1D).
In the neutrophil, the weak edges on the gene page
D78 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue
have disappeared, suggesting that those weakly
coexpressed genes are coexpressed in other tissues
or samples. In the zoom-out view, this coexpression
group, including ACTR3, is composed of distinct
gene groups for actin regulation, which includes all
seven subunits of the Arp2/3 complex and other
genes involved in actin regulation (RHOA, MAP2K2
and RAP1A).
Example 2: obtaining coexpressed genes for
a particular function
In the previous example, we introduced the central gene
page and the tissue-speciﬁc network page. Here, we intro-
duce the GO network page using the human viral defence
system as an example. Humans have a complicated and
well-developed system to counter viral challenge.

step indicated by green arrows. (A) Top page. (B) Keyword search result. (C) Gene page for ACTR3. In the functional annotation section, the ‘list’ is
linked to the list of genes, including the GO term and all GO subcategory terms. The ‘network’ is linked to GO network page (see Figure 2C). When a
GO annotation is linked to any publication, the GO evidence codes (TAS and IPI in this example) of the GO annotation is linked to a corresponding
PubMed page. The ‘ortholog page’ is linked to the page for parallel view of the gene page for this gene and its mouse ortholog. Small icons on
the right side of the page are external links. Subcellular localizations are predicted by WoLF PSORT software, the score for which is scaled from
0 (less reliable) to 10 (most reliable), in integers. In the coexpression section, a coexpression network for the 20 highest coexpressed genes to the query
gene is provided. The network consists of nodes and edges. Each node represents a coexpressed gene, which works as a link to the corresponding
gene page, and each edge indicates the strength of coexpression by its thickness (see DATA SOURCES AND CALCULATIONS for details).
The shaded node highlights the current gene, and the red edges, if any, indicate existence of reported PPIs according to the HPRD annotation (14).
The orange edges indicate the existence of strong coexpression between the corresponding orthologs in mouse. The gene list is located in a table next
to the network. The value of each expression pattern similarity (ExSim) in the table is highlighted by red colour corresponding to the edge
thicknesses. The ‘detail’ in the table is linked to the coexpression viewer, which illustrates the contribution of each sample to the expression pattern
similarity. See the text for the explanation of the other section shown. (D) Tissue-speciﬁc network page for neutrophils. ACTR3 is marked with
a yellow symbol.

Identiﬁcation of the genes in a system is the ﬁrst step
for deeper understanding of the system. For gene
identiﬁcation, it is eﬃcient to list and classify the genes
of co-functional candidates using coexpressed genes.
For this purpose, COXPRESdb could be used as follows
(Figure 2). (Also shown at http://coxpresdb.hgc.jp/help/
tutorial/2.html.)
(1) Search ‘virus’ as a keyword using the search form on
the top page (Figure 2A), and follow the ‘response to
virus’ link in the search result table (Figure 2B).
(2) The GO network page provides the coexpressed
gene networks of 30 highly coexpressed genes in
the query GO term (Figure 2C). The table under the
network contains more detailed gene descriptions.
Figure 2. An example of the listing for genes related to virus-response using COXPRESdb. The thin red circles in (A), (B) and (C) indicate the link
to the next step indicated by green arrows. (A) Top page. (B) Keyword search result. The ‘list’ is linked to the list of the genes including the GO term
and all GO subcategory terms. The ‘network’ is linked to the GO network page. (C) GO network page. See text for details. (D) Results of the
coexpressed gene search. Gene symbols in the pink box indicate query genes from the previous step.

Five networks for human and four for mouse can
be found for the GO term (Figure 2C). To deduce
the biological meaning of each network, the informa-
tion in the external links on each gene page is
useful in addition to the information presented
in COXPRESdb. As a result of careful inspection
of each gene page, the ﬁve gene networks seem to
correspond to a biological function in response to
a virus, as follows: (i) interferon-responsive gene
network, (ii) interferon a gene network, (iii) inter-
feron receptor network, (iv) interleukin and tumour
necrosis factor network and (v) three chemokines
and other networks. Two additional networks,
corresponding to networks 1 and 2, are also found
in mouse.
(3) The GO network page provides the network of
the genes that are already annotated as ‘response to
virus’. To ﬁnd other components lacking the
annotation but relating to virus response, it would
be promising to search for coexpressed genes
from these groups. This can be done easily in
COXPRESdb by activating the check box on the
left side of the table and pushing the button ‘search
coexpressed genes from selected genes’ (Figure 2D).
This will provide a list of the top 300 highly
coexpressed genes. The list contains putative func-
tional and unknown genes in addition to known
interferon a genes. In the same way, the user can
obtain coexpressed genes for other gene groups.
Finally, entire gene lists containing putative virus-
responsive genes can be obtained.
DATA SOURCES AND CALCULATIONS
Calculation of gene coexpression
To deﬁne reliable coexpressed genes, we constructed gene
expression proﬁles using as many genes and samples as
possible. Toward this end, GPL570 (Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 Array: 54 614 probesets) and GPL1261
(Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array: 45 037 probesets) were
selected from NCBI GEO (4). Some samples were omitted
due to diﬀerent GeneChip usage, e.g. ChIP-on-chip or
heterohybridization of close species. As a result, we used
3749 human and 2226 mouse samples as the raw data
(CEL ﬁles). The correspondence between probes and
genes is based on the NCBI annotations. Only the probes
mapped to a single gene were used, resulting in 44 793 and
40 083 probes mapped to 19 777 and 21 036 genes for
human and mouse, respectively.
We used the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA)
method (20) for GeneChip normalization and weighted
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients based on sample redun-
dancies to measure probe-to-probe expression pattern
similarity (8). The sample redundancy is calculated as the
number of similar samples in the data set, and the sample
similarity is measured by the correlation between samples.
(See the help page at http://coxpresdb.hgc.jp/help/
coex_cal.html for details.) Since most of the genes
have multiple probes in the mammalian GeneChip,
gene-to-gene expression pattern similarities (ExSims) are
evaluated as the maximum value of corresponding probe-
to-probe correlations from the corresponding probe-to-
probe ExSims. All coexpression values can be downloaded
from COXPRESdb in tab-delimitated text ﬁles.
Strength of coexpression for network and edge thickness
The ExSims were converted to mutual rank (MR) to
evaluate the strength of coexpression. For any given pair,
gene A and gene B, the MR is calculated as an average of
the rank of gene B in the coexpressed genes to gene A
(ordered by ExSims) and the average of the rank of gene A
to gene B. For our coexpression data, the correlation rank
and MR were a better measure of similarity than the
correlation value to determine related genes (Obayashi
et al., unpublished results). This is partly because even the
gene pair with a low ExSim can work together if no other
genes are highly coexpressed, as in the example of human
histone cluster—where one gene is highly coexpressed
according to the MRs, although ExSims are lower than
0.5 (see http://coxpresdb.hgc.jp/help/mr.html). To draw
the coexpression network, we used three thresholds to
determine the thickness of edges: bold edges (MR <5),
normal edges (5 MR <30) and thin edges (30 MR
<50). The MR is also used to select genes in GO networks
and tissue-speciﬁc networks, where genes are selected
from highly coexpressed pairs up to a deﬁned number
(30 genes for GO network and 1000 genes for tissue-
speciﬁc network).
Tissue-specific gene expression data
Data from GSE3526 for human (21) and GSE1986 for
mouse in NCBI GEO were used for the tissue-speciﬁc gene
expression graph on the gene page. After RMA normal-
ization, the probe intensities were averaged for each tissue.
These tissues were manually ordered and grouped from
the viewpoints of tissue function and gene expression
similarity. For the construction of the tissue-speciﬁc
network page, HPRD data (release version 7.0) were
used. The coexpressed gene networks were constructed for
63 tissues, in which more than 50 genes are highly
coexpressed (MR <50).
