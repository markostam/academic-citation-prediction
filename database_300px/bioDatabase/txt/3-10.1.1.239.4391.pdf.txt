SPHERICAL DESIGNS AND ZETA FUNCTIONS OF LATTICES.
RENAUD COULANGEON
ABSTRACT. We set up a connection between the theory of spherical designs and the question of
minima of Epstein’s zeta function. More precisely, we prove that a Euclidean lattice, all layers
of which hold a 4-design, achieves a local minimum of the Epstein’s zeta function, at least at any
real s > n
2
. We deduce from this a new proof of Sarnak and Stro¨mbergsson’s theorem asserting
that the root lattices D4 and E8, as well as the Leech lattice Λ24, achieve a strict local minimum
of the Epstein’s zeta function at any s > 0. Furthermore, our criterion enables us to extend their
theorem to all the so-called extremal modular lattices (up to certain restrictions) using a theorem
of Bachoc and Venkov, and to other classical families of lattices (e.g. the Barnes-Wall lattices).
INTRODUCTION.
A spherical design is a finite set of points on a sphere which is well-distributed, in the sense
that it allows numerical integration of functions on the sphere up to a certain accurracy, the so-
called strength of the design. More precisely, X ⊂ Sn−1 is a t-design if for all homogeneous
polynomial of degree ≤ t
(1)
∫
Sn−1
f(x)dx =
1
|X|
∑
x∈X
f(x)
where Sn−1 stands for the unit sphere in Rn endowed with its canonical measure dx, normalized
so as
∫
Sn−1
dx = 1.
One classical way to build such designs is to consider the set of vectors of a given length in a
Euclidean lattice L in Rn, rescaled so as to lie in Sn−1. It has long been observed that there is a
link between the ability of getting designs of high strength in that way and classical properties
of the underlying lattice e.g. density, symmetries, theta series. In this connection one can quote
Venkov’s remarkable theorem asserting that if the set of minimal vectors (non zero vectors of
minimal length) of a lattice is a 4-design, then the lattice is extreme in Voronoı¨’s sense i.e. it
achieves a local maximum of the packing density function [19].
There are many examples of lattices for which not only the set of minimal vectors holds a design,
but all sets of vectors of any given length actually do. This happens for instance with the so-called
extremal modular lattices, as shown by Bachoc and Venkov using theta series with spherical
coefficients (see[2] and Section 3 below). Another instance of this phenomenon is when the
automorphism group of the lattice is ”big enough” to satisfy Goethals and Seidel’s theorem (see
1
2 RENAUD COULANGEON
[9, The´ore`me 6.1.]), or Section 3 below). In all these cases, since not only minimal vectors, but
all layers are involved, one would expect some more consequences on the associated packing
than local optimality for the density. One aim of the present paper is to provide an interpretation
of this phenomenon in terms of Epstein’s ζ-function.
The Epstein zeta function of a lattice L is defined, for s ∈ C with Re(s) > n
2
, as
(2) ζ(L, s) :=
∑
x∈L−{0}
||x||−2s
and admits a meromorphic continuation to the complex plane with a simple pole at s = n
2
. The
question as to which L, for fixed s > 0 (s 6= n
2
) minimizes ζ(L, s), has a long history, starting
with Sobolev’s work on numerical integration ([18]), and a series of subsequent papers by Delone
and Ryshkov among others. Of course, this question makes sense only if one restricts to lattices
of fixed covolume, say 1, since
(3) ∀λ > 0 ζ(λL, s) = λ−2sζ(L, s).
From now on, we denote L◦n the set of lattices of determinant (covolume) 1. Another, undoubt-
edly more important, reason to investigate this question, is its connection with Riemannian geom-
etry : if X is a compact Riemannian manifold, its height h(X) is defined as ζ ′X(0), where ζX(s)
is the so-called zeta regularisation of the determinant of the Laplacian, i.e. ζX(s) =
∑
λj 6=0
λ−sj ,
where the λj are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on X . When X is a flat torus Rn/L, with L
a full rank lattice in Rn, then ζX(s) is the same as ζ(L∗, s), up to a constant (see [5] and [15]).
In this context, a natural question is to find lattices achieving a minimum of this height func-
tion restricted to flat tori (the existence of such a minimum is shown in [5]), which amounts to
minimize ζ ′(L∗, 0) for L ∈ L◦n.
We say that a lattice L0 ∈ L◦ is ζ-extreme at s ∈ R if it achieves a strict local minimum of the
function L 7→ ζ(L, s), L ∈ L◦n. Delone and Ryshkov’s obtained a characterization of lattices in
L◦n that are ζ-extreme at s for any large enough s ([6, Theorem 4]). One of the conditions is that
all layers of the lattice hold a 2-design (see Section 1).
One would naturally ask for an explicit value s0 such that L0 is ζ-extreme at s for any s ≥ s0,
but unfortunately, it is not possible to derive such an s0 from Delone and Ryshkov’s theorem, nor
from its proof . However, using more sophisticated tools, Sarnak and Stro¨mbergsson proved in
[16] the following theorem
Theorem (Sarnak & Stro¨mbergsson (2006)). The D4 lattice (rescaled so as to have determinant
1), the E8-lattice and the Leech Lattice Λ24 are ζ-extreme at s for any s > 0, and the associated
tori achieve a strict local minimum of the height function on the set of flat tori of covolume 1 and
dimension 4, 8 and 24 respectively.
Their proof relies essentially on a certain property of the automorphism group of those lattices
which is shown to imply the desired property, at least for s > n
2
(the proof for s in the ”critical
strip” 0 < s < n
2
is more involved and requires some extra arguments). Inspired by Delone and
SPHERICAL DESIGNS AND ZETA FUNCTIONS OF LATTICES. 3
Ryshkov’s theorem, one may ask for an explanation of this result in terms of spherical designs.
This is precisely the aim of our main theorem, which we now state
Theorem 1. Let L ∈ L◦n be such that all its layers hold a 4-design. Then L is ζ-extreme at s for
any s > n
2
, and the torus associated with its dual L∗ achieves a strict local minimum of the height
on the set of n-dimensional flat tori of covolume 1. If moreover ζ(L, s) < 0 for 0 < s < n
2
, then
L is ζ-extreme at s for any s > 0, s 6= n
2
.
This theorem applies to D4, E8 and Λ24, and somehow clarifies Sarnak and Stro¨mbergsson’s
proof. Moreover, it should apply to a wider class of lattices, for which the group theoretic tools
used in [16] are not available, but for which one can prove however that the 4-design properties
hold for all layers. In particular we prove that essentially all the extremal modular lattices (up to
certain restrictions on both the dimension and the level) share with D4, E8 and Λ24 the property
of being ζ-extreme at s for any s > n
2
, s 6= n
2
(see proposition 3.3 in section 3).
The paper is organized as follows : in Section 1 we collect some preliminary results about lattices,
spherical designs and Epstein ζ function. Section 2 contains the proof of the main theorem, and
finally, we present several examples of application in Section 3.
Notation. We denote x · y the usual scalar product of the vectors x and y in Rn, and ‖x‖ the
associated norm. We write vectors in Rn as column vectors. The transpose of a matrix is denoted
by the superscript ′. Also, if A is a square n-by-n matrix, and x a vector in Rn, the notation A[x]
stands for the product x′Ax.
The set of n-by-n symmetric matrices with real entries is denoted Sn(R). It is endowed with its
canonical scalar product
(4) 〈A,B〉 := TrAB A,B ∈ Sn(R).
If A ∈ Sn(R) is fixed, one associates with any x ∈ Rn such that A[x] 6= 0 the n-by-n symmetric
matrix
(5) x̂A := xx
′
A[x]
.
One has 〈H, x̂A〉 = H [x]
A[x]
for any H ∈ Sn(R).
1. BASICS.
1.1. Lattices and quadratic forms. Throughout the paper, we denote Ln (resp. L◦n) the set of
Euclidean lattices (resp. of covolume 1) in Rn, and Pn (resp. P◦n) the cone of positive definite
quadratic forms (resp. of determinant 1) in n variables. We identify a quadratic form in Pn
with its matrix in the canonical basis of Rn. The map P 7→ P ′P induces a bijection from
4 RENAUD COULANGEON
On(R) \ GLn(R) onto Pn and we thus identify these two sets. Similarly, we identify Ln
with the quotient GLn(R)/GLn(Z), associating the lattice L = PZn the coset PGLn(Z) ∈
GLn(R)/GLn(Z). There is a well-known ”dictionary” between Euclidean lattices and positive
definite quadratic forms which is summarized in the following diagram

This enables to formulate every definition and statement in either of these languages but, depend-
ing on the context, one point of view is often better than the other. In particular, the proof of the
main theorem is easier to write in terms of quadratic forms.
Let L = PZn be a lattice in Rn, and A = P ′P the corresponding quadratic form. We define
the sequence m1(L) < m2(L) < · · · of squared lengths of non zero vectors in L, ranged in
increasing order (this is not the same, in general, as the successive minima of L). The k-th layer
of L, for k ∈ N \ {0}, is defined as
(6) Mk(L) := {x ∈ L | x · x = mk(L)}
and we set
(7) ak(L) = |Mk(L)|.
One defines similarly the sequence (mk(A))k∈N\{0} of successive values achieved by the qua-
dratic form A on Zn\{0}, as well as the associated layers Mk(A) := {x ∈ Zn | A[x] = mk(A)}.
1.2. Spherical designs. We collect in this section some properties that we will need in the se-
quel. We take as original definition of a spherical t-design the one we gave in the introduction of
this text. For sake of completeness, we recall first a proposition to be found in [19], which pro-
vides several characterizations of spherical designs. We recall that a polynomial P (x1, · · · , xn)
is harmonic if ∆P = 0, where ∆ is the usual laplace operator ∆ =
∑n
i=1
∂2
∂x2i
.
Proposition 1.1 (Venkov [19, The´ore`me 3.2.]). Let X be a finite subset of Sn−1 and t an even
positive integer. Assume that X is symmetric about 0, i.e. X = −X . Then the following
properties are equivalent :
(1) X is a t-design.
(2) For all non constant harmonic polynomial P (x) of degree ≤ t, ∑x∈X f(x) = 0.
(3) There exists a constant c such that ∀α ∈ Rn∑x∈X(x · α)t = c(α · α) t2 .
SPHERICAL DESIGNS AND ZETA FUNCTIONS OF LATTICES. 5
Proof. See [19, The´ore`me 3.2.]. The only difference is that the condition ∀α ∈ Rn∑x∈X(x ·
α)i = 0, where i = t − 1, which should appear in (2), is automatically satisfied here since X is
symmetric about the origin. 
The next proposition is the key to the proof of our main theorem. It is a formulation of the
property that all layers of a lattice L hold a 2- (resp. 4-) design, in terms of its zeta function.
Proposition 1.2. Let L = PZn be a lattice in Rn, and A = P ′P .

(a) All layers of L hold a 2-design.
(b) For all s ∈ C with Res > n

2. The following conditions are equivalent
(a) All layers of L hold a 4-design.
(b) For all s ∈ C with Res > n
2
, for all H ∈ Sn(R),∑
y∈L\{0}
H [y]2
‖y‖2(s+2) =

〈H, x̂A〉2
A[x]s
=
ζ(A, s)
n(n + 2)
((TrA−1H)2 + 2Tr(A−1H)2).
Proof. 1. The equivalence between (b) and (c) is straightforward, using the dictionary lat-
tices/quadratic forms, so it is enough to prove the equivalence between (a) and (b). Assume
that all layers of L are 2-designs. From proposition 1.1, this means that for all k ∈ N \ {0}, there
exists a constant ck such that
(8) ∀α ∈ Rn
∑
y∈Mk(L)
(y · α)2 = ck(α · α)2
This equation may be viewed as an equality between quadratic forms in α, which, once written
matricially, reads
(9)
∑
y∈Mk(L)
yy′ = ckIn.
It remains to compute the constant ck, which is achieved by taking the trace. This yields
ck =
ak(L)mk(L)
n
.

Adding up the contributions of all k ∈ N \ {0}, we get the foreseen relation
(10)
∑
y∈L\{0}
yy′
‖y‖2(s+1) =
ζ(L, s)
n
In.
Assume conversely that (b) holds. This is an equality between Dirichlet series, so it must hold
coefficientwise. Identifying the coefficients of mk(L)−s in both sides of (b) yields a relation
similar to (9), hence a 2-design relation for the set of vectors of squared length mk(L).
2. Again, it is enough to prove the equivalence between (a) and (b). Assume first that all layers
of L are 4-designs. For fixed H ∈ TA we set PH(x) := 〈H, xx′〉2 = H [x]2, x ∈ Rn. It is a
homogenous polynomial of degree 4 in x. From [19, The´ore`me 2.1.], it decomposes as
(11) PH(x) = P4(x) + ‖x‖2P2(x) + ‖x‖4P0(x),
where Pi(x) is an harmonic polynomial of degree i, i.e. ∆Pi = 0, depending on H . From
proposition 1.1(2), the property that each layer of L holds a 4-design implies that for i = 2, 4
and for all k ∈ N \ {0} ∑
x∈Mk(L)
Pi(x) = 0.
Consequently, using (11) we obtain
∀k ∈ N \ {0},
∑
x∈Mk(L)
PH(x) =
∑
x∈Mk(L)
‖x‖4P0(x) = mk(L)2#Mk(L) · P0
since P0(x) = P0 is a constant. So what we finally need is to compute P0 in (11). Applying ∆
to the right-hand side of (11) twice, we obtain since the Pi are harmonic,
(12) ∆2PH(x) = 8n(n + 2)P0.
On the other hand, one can compute ∆2PH(x) directly from the definition of PH(x) = H [x]2.
Easy calculations yield
∆H [x] = 2TrH and ∆H [x]2 = 4(TrH)H [x] + 8H2[x]
whence finally
(13) ∆2PH(x) = ∆2H [x]2 = 8(TrH)2 + 16TrH2.
Comparing (12) and (13), we get
(14) P0 = (TrH)
2 + 2TrH2
n(n + 2)
.
Adding up the contributions of all k ∈ N \ {0} yields formula (b). Assume conversely that (b)
holds. Applying it to H = αα′, for a given α ∈ Rn, we obtain∑
y∈L\{0}
(y · α)4
‖y‖2(s+2) =
ζ(L, s)
n(n+ 2)
3(α · α)2
SPHERICAL DESIGNS AND ZETA FUNCTIONS OF LATTICES. 7
and identifying the coefficient of mk(L)−s on both sides for all k ∈ N \ {0}, we get∑
y∈Mk(L)
(y · α)4 = 3ak(L)mk(L)
2
n(n + 2)
(α · α)2
whence the conclusion. 
Remark 1.3. Lattices satisfying any of the equivalent conditions 1(a) and 1(b) in Proposition 1.2
are called ”strongly critical” in [6]. This property partly characterizes lattices that are ζ-extreme
at s for any large enough s. More precisely, one may reformulate [6, Theorem 4] as
Theorem (Delone & Ryshkov [6, Theorem 4]). The following conditions for L ∈ L◦n are equiv-
alent.
(1) There exists s0 > 0 such that L is ζ-extreme at s for any s > so.
(2) L is perfect, and all layers of L hold a 2-design.
(recall that a lattice L is perfect if ∑x∈M1(L) Rxx′ = Sn(R)).
2. PROOF OF THEOREM 1.
We view P◦n as a differentiable submanifold of Sn(R). The tangent space TA at any point A
identifies with the set {H ∈ Sn(R) | 〈A−1, H〉 = 0}. Moreover, the exponential map H 7→
eA(H) = A exp(A
−1H) induces a local diffeomorphism from TA onto P◦n. Consequently we
have to study the local behaviour of the map H 7→ ζ(eA(H), s), H ∈ TA for fixed s > 0. A
simple calculation, based on the Taylor expansion of the exponential, yields
ζ(eA(H), s) = ζ(A, s)− s

in which the abbreviated notation

(Proposition 1.2), the property that all layers of L are 2-designs is equivalent to the relation

Tr(A−1H)2.
8 RENAUD COULANGEON
Next we use the assumption that all layers of L are 4-designs to compute the term
∑
′ 〈H, x̂A〉2
A[x]s
.
From Proposition 1.2 we have, for H ∈ TA,
(19)
∑
′ 〈H, x̂A〉2
A[x]s
=
ζ(A, s)
n(n + 2)
((TrA−1H)2 + 2Tr(A−1H)2) =
2ζ(A, s)
n(n+ 2)
Tr(A−1H)2.
Inserting the last three formulas into (15), we obtain
(20) ζ(eA(H), s) = ζ(A, s)
[
1 +
s(s− n

)
n(n+ 2)
Tr(A−1H)2
]
+ o(‖H2‖).
Consequently, the assertion thatA achieves a strict local minimum onP◦n of the mapA 7→ ζ(A, s)
is equivalent to the fact that ζ(A, s)
s(s− n
2
)
n(n+ 2)
> 0. This is clearly the case if s > n
2
, while for
0 < s < n
2
this is equivalent to ζ(A, s) < 0.
As for the assertion on the height function, we just have to differentiate (20) with respect to s to
get

= ζ ′(A, 0) +

n+ 2
Tr(A−1H)2 + o(‖H2‖),(22)
since ζ(A, 0) = −1, whence the conclusion. This finishes the proof of Theorem 1. 
3. EXAMPLES.
In order to avoid rescaling systematically all the lattices appearing in the examples below to
covolume 1, we will use the slightly abusive formulation ”L is ζ-extreme” to mean that ”L
rescaled to covolume 1 is ζ-extreme”. Similarly, we say that ”the torus associated withL achieves
a local minimum of the height function” to mean ”a local minimum on the set of flat tori of the
same covolume detL”.
Before we give some explicit examples, we wish to give a first comparison between our criterion
for a lattice to be ζ-extreme and Sarnak-Stro¨mbgergsson’s one. For the proof of [16, Theo-
rem 1], one considers the space Symf Sym2(Rn) for f = 0, 1, 2, . . . endowed with the stan-
dard action of O(n), and define f(L) to be the largest integer such that Symf Sym2(Rn)O(n) =
Symf Sym2(Rn)Aut(L). Then it is proven that if f(L) ≥ 2 then L is ζ-extreme for s > n
2
. As no-
ticed by the authors, the determination of f(L) is related to the somewhat more classical problem
of determining the largest integer t(L) such that Symt(Rn)O(n) = Symt(Rn)Aut(L), a question
which is itself connected with the existence of spherical designs in lattices. To be more precise,
one has the following result
Theorem (Goethals and Seidel[9, The´ore`me 6.1.]). The following conditions for a finite sub-
group G of O(n) are equivalent :
SPHERICAL DESIGNS AND ZETA FUNCTIONS OF LATTICES. 9
(1) Symt(Rn)O(n) = Symt(Rn)G.
(2) Any orbit G · a of a point a ∈ Sn−1 is a t-design.
The combination of this with Theorem 1 leads to the following corollary
Corollary 3.1. If t(L) ≥ 4 then L is ζ-extreme for s > n
2
, and the torus associated with L∗
achieves a local minimum of the height function.
Proof. For any k ∈ N \ {0} and any x ∈ Mk(L), the orbit of x under Aut(L) is a 4-design, so
that Mk(L) is itself a 4-design, as a union of 4-designs. 
Note that the assumption that t(L) ≥ 4 is equivalent to t(L) ≥ 5, since t(L) is easily seen to be
odd. Sarnak and Stro¨mbergsson pointed out that
(23) f(L) ≤ t(L)− 1
2
,
so that f(L) ≥ 2 actually implies t(L) ≥ 5. However, they also observed that (23) is in general
a strict inequality, so that the assumption f(L) ≥ 2 is in general stronger than the assumption of
Corollary 3.1, which is itself stronger than the assumption of Theorem 1.
A good illustration of the combination of our criterion with Goethal and Seidel’s Theorem, is
obtained with the family of Barnes-Wall lattices. Let us briefly recall their definition : if n = 2k,
we consider an orthonormal basis (eu)u∈F
2k
of Rn indexed by the elements of F2k and set
(24) BWn :=
〈
2⌊
k−d+1
2
⌋
∑
u∈U
eu
〉
Z
⊂ Rn
where U runs through the set of affine subspaces of Rn and d stands for the dimension of U . This
defines for any n an isodual lattice, i.e. isometric to its dual. These lattices are very interesting
inasmuch they form one of the very few infinite families of lattices for which explicit compu-
tations can be made (density, kissing number, automorphism group etc.), although they do not
provide, in dimension ≥ 32, the best known lattice packings. Various explicit descriptions of the
automorphism group of BWn are known (see for instance [3]), and its polynomial invariants are
computed in [1]. Altogether, this leads to the following proposition :
Proposition 3.2. For k ≥ 3, the Barnes-Wall lattice BW2k is ζ-extreme for any s > n2 and the
associated torus achieves a strict local minimum of the height function.
Proof. From [1, Corollary 5.1.], we see that t(BW2k) ≥ 6, whence the conclusion using corollary
3.1 (notice that for an isodual lattice L, the tori associated with L or its dual are the same, up to
scaling). 
Other examples of lattices L satisfying t(L) ≥ 4 (and thus our main theorem) are the root
lattices E6 and E7, as well are their duals. Finally, a list of lattices in dimension ≤ 26 to which
10 RENAUD COULANGEON
this argument applies is provided in [1, table 1] (note that only the lattices pertaining to what is
called case (1) and (3) there are suitable).
In the examples below, we prove that some lattices L are ζ-extreme without computing neither
f(L) nor t(L). Instead, we refer to the paper [2] by Bachoc and Venkov, where the existence
of spherical designs in certain lattices is proven using modular forms. The lattices dealt with in
that paper pertain to Quebbemann’s theory of modular lattices (see [13] or [17]), from which we
recall the main definitions and results. A lattice L in Ln is ℓ-modular (ℓ > 0) if
(i) L is even, i.e. x · x ∈ 2Z for all x ∈ L.
(ii) L is isometric to
√
ℓL∗.
Assume furthermore that ℓ ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 23}. Then ( [17, Theorem 2.1.]) the minimum of
an ℓ-modular lattice L satisfies
(25) minL ≤ 2(1 + ⌊n(1 + ℓ)
48
⌋)
An ℓ-modular lattice L for which equality holds in (25) is called extremal. The theta series,
and more generally the theta series with spherical coefficients of ℓ-modular lattices belong to a
a certain algebra of modular forms, which can be described explicitely when ℓ belongs to the
set above. From this description, Bachoc and Venkov deduce various results about the existence
of spherical designs in extremal modular lattices (see [2, Corollary 3.1.]). Applying their result
together with Theorem 1, one easily derives the following proposition :
Proposition 3.3. Let L be an extremal ℓ-modular lattice of dimension n such that ℓ = 1 and
n ≡ 0, 8 mod 24, or ℓ = 2 and n ≡ 0, 4 mod 16, or ℓ = 3 and n ≡ 0, 2 mod 12. Then L is
ζ-extreme for any s > n
2
and the associated torus achieves a strict local minimum of the height
function.
Proof. From [2, Corollary 3.1.], all layers of such a lattice hold a 4-design, whence the conclu-
sion. The proof of this fact uses theta series with spherical coefficients. 
The previous proposition applies to the E8 and the Leech lattice (l = 1), as well as the D4 lattice
(l = 2), recovering Sarnak and Stro¨mbergsson’s result, at least for s > n
2
. But this also applies
for instance to the hexagonal lattice A2, to all extremal even unimodular lattices in dimension 32
and 48, to the Coxeter-Todd lattice K12 or the Barnes-Wall lattice Λ16 to cite a few. Note that the
occurrence of the hexagonal lattice A2 in this list is not a surprise, since it is known to achieve a
global minimum of the map L 7→ ζ(L, s) at s for any s > 0, s 6= n
2
(see [7], [8] and [14]).
4. FINAL REMARKS.
We conclude with some remarks and open questions.
SPHERICAL DESIGNS AND ZETA FUNCTIONS OF LATTICES. 11
(1) In the examples quoted above, we applied our main theorem to derive ζ-extremality at s
for any s > n
2
. To get the same result for 0 < s < n
2
, one has to prove that ζ(L, s) < 0 in
that range, which was done by Sarnak and Stro¨mbergsson in the case of D4, E8 and Λ24.
Unfortunately, we don’t know of any ’uniform’ way to prove this property, so that a case
by case proof would be necessary to deal with the examples of the previous section. We
leave this question open.
(2) The condition that all the layers of a given lattice hold a 4-design is rather strong. Lattices
for which the first layer (minimal vectors) hold a 4-design, the so-called ’strongly perfect
lattices’, have been classified in dimensions up to 12 (see [19], [11], [12]). In turns out
that in dimension 3, 5, and 9, for instance, such a lattice (and a fortiori a lattice all the
layers of which hold a 4-design) does not exist. As for the weaker condition that all the
layers of a given lattice hold a 2-design, which is necessary for the lattice to be ζ-extremal
at s for all big enough s, according to Delone and Ryshkov’s theorem, it is easy to find
examples in any dimension : for instance, all irreducible root lattices hold this property.
However, it is still not clear that a lattice achieving a global minimum of the function
L 7→ ζ(L, s) for any s > n
2
(or even for all large enough s) should exist.
(3) The situation for the height function is perhaps more intriguing. Indeed, it is known (see
[5]) that in a given dimension n, the height function, restricted to flat tori, achieves a
global minimum. On the other hand, in dimension 3, 5, and 9 for instance, there is no
hope to find this minimum using the criterion of Theorem 1. Consequently, the right
characterization of local minima of the height function is still to be found (our condition
is too strong). Recall that such a characterization for the local maxima of the density of
lattice-sphere packings is known, due to Voronoı¨ (see [20] or [10, Chapter 3]).
