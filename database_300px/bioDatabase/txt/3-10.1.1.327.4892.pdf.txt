facilitate the development of assays for the discovery of pharmaceu-
ticals capable of mimicking the effects of caloric restriction (CR) on
life- and healthspan (CR mimetics), we evaluated the effectiveness of
glucoregulatory and putative cancer chemopreventatives in reproduc-
ing the hepatic gene expression profile produced by long-term CR
(LTCR), using Affymetrix microarrays. We have shown that CR
initiated late in life begins to extend lifespan, reduce cancer as a cause
of death, and reproduce approximately three-quarters of the genomic
effects of LTCR in 8 wk (CR8). Eight weeks of metformin treatment
was superior to CR8 at reproducing LTCR-like gene expression
changes, maintaining a superior number of such changes over a broad
range of statistical stringencies, and producing more Gene Ontology
terms overlapping those produced by LTCR. Consistent with these
results, metformin has been shown to reduce cancer incidence in mice
and humans. Phenformin, a chemical cousin of metformin, extends
lifespan and reduces tumor incidence in mice. Taken together, these
results indicate that gene expression biomarkers can be used to
identify promising candidate CR mimetics.

longevity therapeutics
A MAJOR GOAL OF pharmaceutical research has been to reduce
morbidity and delay mortality in the elderly. However, there
are presently no authentic longevity pharmaceuticals. The
reason none have been found is that no assay has existed for
rapidly identifying such drugs. It is unlikely that human trials
of potentially lifespan-extending pharmaceuticals will ever be
conducted using death as the endpoint. Nevertheless, it appears
likely that such pharmaceuticals could be developed or may
already exist. Most therapeutics for human diseases were
discovered using surrogate assays, with little or no knowledge
of the molecular mechanisms of the disease.
We know that lifespan can be extended in experimental
mammals by at least two interventions, and they are additive in
their effects. Caloric restriction (CR) is a nutritional interven-
tion capable of consistently and dramatically extending life-
span and reducing the incidence and severity of most age-
related diseases, including cancer, whether it is initiated in
young or older mice (10, 35). In addition, genetic ablation of
growth hormone (GH) or its receptor or insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-I) or its receptor produces a dwarf phenotype and
extends the lifespan of rodents (5). Such mutations are thought
to slow aging because they postpone the age-related develop-
ment of neoplastic diseases, immune system decline, and
collagen cross-linking (5). CR and the Ames dwarf mutation
act together to additively change gene expression and increase
the lifespan of mice (6). Other long-lived mouse mutants have
been identified, suggesting that additional, potentially drug-
gable genetic pathways exist for ameliorating age-related dis-
eases and extending lifespan (31, 32).
The development of assays useful in the discovery of drugs
capable of extending lifespan has proven problematic. Lifespan
studies conducted in “short-lived” mammals such as mice
might appear useful. However, a vigorous mouse strain lives
40 mo. In addition, large groups of animals are required for
such studies, making the assays too costly and time consuming
to be practical. Use of enfeebled rodent strains introduces
confounds into such studies and has not been helpful in
identifying authentic longevity medicaments.
A number of lines of evidence, including nonhuman primate
and human studies, suggest that CR-like processes may be
involved in determining human longevity (39, 52). Thus the
molecular mechanisms responsible for life- and healthspan
extension in animals may also have applications in human
health. Many gerontologists have assumed that a CR mimetic
drug would need to be administered over an animal’s lifetime
to resist incremental, age-related changes in physiology and
gene expression. However, we recently showed that CR initi-
ated in older mice begins within just 8 wk to extend lifespan
and shift the expression of hepatic and heart genes toward the
“slow-aging profile” associated with long-term CR (LTCR;
Refs. 10, 11, 44). CR initially reduced deaths from tumors by
3.1-fold (10). Approximately 75% of these tumors are liver
tumors (44). For these reasons, we focused the studies reported
here on liver gene expression.
The data reviewed above suggest that relatively brief treat-
ments with a CR mimetic drug should be capable of shifting
the rate of aging and gene expression toward that of LTCR.
This introduces the possibility that potential CR mimetics can
be rapidly screened using microarray profiling as a surrogate
for their effects on lifespan and health. To test this hypothesis,
we evaluated the effectiveness of five potential CR mimetics at
reproducing the gene expression profiles of CR in mouse liver,
using Affymetrix microarrays. Because of the linkage between
insulin, IGF-I, and the rate of aging, we tested the effects of the
glucoregulatory compounds metformin (MET), glipizide (GLIP),
GLIP plus MET (GM), and rosiglitazone (ROS) for their
ability to reproduce the effects of LTCR on hepatic gene
expression. We also tested soy isoflavone extract (SOY) for its
LTCR-like gene expression effects, because it is often touted
as a potentially lifespan-extending chemopreventative that is
thought to work through mechanisms unrelated to insulin-
IGF-I signaling. These data indicate that 8 wk of treatment
with MET was even better at reproducing the gene expression
effects of LTCR than 8 wk of CR (CR8). These results are
consistent with published studies, and together they identify
MET as a potential CR mimetic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice and diets. One-month-old male mice of the long-lived
B6C3F1 strain were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and
maintained as described after weaning (15). Mice were housed in
groups of four per cage and fed a nonpurified diet, PMI Nutrition
International Product no. 5001 (Purina Mills, Richmond, IN). At 5 mo
of age, the mice were individually housed and randomly assigned to
one of two groups, control (CON) or LTCR. CON mice were fed 93
kcal/wk of a defined control diet (AIN-93M, diet no. F05312, BIO-
SERV). LTCR mice were fed 52.2 kcal/wk of a defined CR diet
(AIN-93M 40% Restricted, diet no. F05314, BIO-SERV). The LTCR
mice consumed 40% fewer calories than the CON group. The CR
diet was enriched so that the CR mice consumed approximately the
same amount of protein, vitamins, and minerals per gram of body
weight as the CON mice. Animal protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
California, Riverside.
Experimental design. At 20 mo of age, cohorts of mice in the CON
group were randomly assigned to one of seven experimental groups.
A CON group continued to be fed 93 kcal/wk of control diet for 8 wk.
A CR8 group was fed 77 kcal/wk of CR diet for 2 wk, followed by
52.2 kcal/wk of CR diet for 6 wk. The remaining dietary groups were
fed the control diets containing MET (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), GLIP
(Sigma), GLIP plus MET (GM), ROS, (Avandia, SmithKline Beecham),
or SOY (NOVASOY 400, Life Extension Foundation) for 8 wk at the
dosages indicated in Table 1. The drugs were mixed with powdered
control diet and cold-pressed into 1-g pellets (BIO-SERV). At 0900,
all mice were fed 2/7 of the weekly allotment of food on Monday and
Wednesday and 3/7 on Friday. The mice had free access to acidified
tap water. They were fasted for 48 h and killed by cervical dislocation
at 22–28 mo of age. No signs of pathology were detected in the
animals used for the studies reported (n  4/group). Organs were
removed rapidly, flash frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The
weights of the mice were monitored biweekly. Mouse weights are
given in Table 1.
Drug dosages. The dosages used for the drugs were chosen to
produce a maximal, but not toxic, effect (Table 1). The MET dosage,
187 mg kg body wt1 day1, is in the range used experimentally in
chemically and genetically diabetic mice to control blood glucose
levels (60–240 mg kg body wt1 day1; Ref. 33). The GLIP dose
(93 mg kg body wt1 day1) was in the range used experimentally to
control blood glucose levels in diabetic animals (100 mg kg body
wt1 day1; Ref. 34). The ROS dose (7 mg kg body wt1 day1)
was consistent with that used in other mouse studies (43). The SOY
dosage is reported to prevent or reduce the growth of transplanted
tumor cells and inhibit the development of chemical- or radiation-
induced tumors in mice (36).
Measurement of specific mRNA levels. Liver total RNA was iso-
lated as described from pathology-free mice (n  4/group; Ref. 12).
mRNA levels were measured using Affymetrix mouse U74Av2 arrays
according to standard Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix).
Probe set expression measurement and normalization. After hy-
bridization and scanning, raw image files were converted to probe set
data (*.CEL files) using Microarray Suite (MAS 5.0). Probe set data
from all 32 arrays were simultaneously analyzed with the robust
multichip average (RMA) method to generate normalized expression
measures for each probe set (Fig. 1; Ref. 28) The data were further
filtered to exclude probe data sets that were “Absent” across all 32
arrays according to the MAS 5.0 detection algorithm (1, 53).

Data analyses. Normalized and filtered data from all groups were
analyzed using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM) algo-
rithm (Fig. 1; Ref. 51). Genes that were differentially expressed
between two or more groups were identified using multiclass SAM
analysis. We set the significance cutoff at a median false discovery
rate (FDR) of 5.0%. To determine the specific effects of each
treatment on gene expression, each treatment group was separately
compared with the CON group using a 1.2-fold change cutoff
(Fig. 1).
Comparison of gene expression changes induced by LTCR and the
drug treatments. To identify gene expression profiles common to drug
treatments and LTCR, we used Venn Mapper, which can determine
the number of statistically significant changes in gene expression
between pairs of treatment groups (42). Venn Mapper reports the
number and identity of up- and downregulated genes in the overlap
and a table of z-values, where a z-value of 1.96 indicates a P value of
0.05 and a z-value of 2.58 indicates a P value of 0.01. The table of
z-values was imported into TreeView for visualization of the z-profile
(Fig. 2; Ref. 18).
Functional comparison of gene expression using Gene Ontology
terms. Sequential application of GenMAPP and MAPPFinder was
used (9, 17). The Affymetrix probe set IDs, fold changes, and P values
from the multiclass SAM and t-test analyses were exported to Gen-
MAPP. The overlapping gene data for each treatment group were
color coded and imported into MAPPFinder for global ontology
analysis. The criteria for overlapping genes were defined as [(LTCR
fold change 1.2 AND LTCR P value 0.05) AND (Compound fold
change 1.2 AND Compound P value 0.05)] for upregulated
transcripts and [(LTCR fold change 1.2 AND LTCR P value
0.05) AND (Compound fold change 1.2 AND Compound P
value 0.05)] for downregulated transcripts. MAPPFinder linked the
expression data of the genes meeting the criterion to the Gene
Ontology (GO) hierarchy and assigned a z-score and a P value to each
GO biological process, cellular component, and molecular function
term. A positive z-score indicates that there are more genes meeting
the criterion in a GO term than would be expected by random chance.
The P value indicates a significant over- or underrepresentation of
genes meeting the criterion for a GO term. The results were further
filtered to include only GO terms with z-score 2 and P value 0.01
and the percentage of genes meeting the criteria 10.
Pathway analyses. Microarray expression data were imported into
PathwayAssist (http://stratagene.com), and all known biological
relationships between the differentially expressed genes were graph-
ically identified. PathwayAssist allows the user to query databases and
direct the construction and visualization of specific biological inter-
action networks (BINs). ResNet, the main database used by Pathway-
Assist, contains molecular networks compiled from the PubMed
database by natural language processing.
RESULTS
We administered MET, GLIP, GM, ROS, or SOY to mice,
cold packed in their diets for a period of 8 wk. A control group
received the diet alone. All these groups were isocaloric, and
their weights did not vary significantly before or after the
studies (Table 1). The studies also included groups that were
LTCR or CR8. The ability of the drugs to reproduce the
genomic effects of LTCR was assessed using the criteria
described below.
Overlapping responses of CR and the candidate mimetics.
We compared the changed genes identified by multiclass SAM
(FDR 5%; Table 2). MET actually produced more LTCR-
like gene expression changes than CR8. MET produced 1,776
LTCR-like changes in gene expression, or 75% of the total
LTCR-responsive genes. CR8 produced 1,675 LTCR-like
changes in gene expression, or 71% of the LTCR-responsive
genes. Eight weeks of MET treatment also reproduced 92% of
the gene expression changes produced by CR8. The other
treatments affected the expression of fewer genes. These re-
sults indicate that 8 wk of treatment with CR or MET were
highly effective at reproducing the gene expression profile
produced by LTCR. MET has been shown to suppress tumor-
igenesis and/or tumor-related mortality in mice, hamsters, and
CR8
Fig. 2. Heat map of the z-values from Venn Mapper. The z-value table
generated by Venn Mapper was visualized using TreeView. Each column
represents up- or downregulated genes in each LTCR array. Each row repre-
sents upregulated or downregulated genes in the CR8, MET, GM, GLIP, ROS,
or SOY groups. The similarity between the results found in the pairs of arrays
was measured by calculating the z-value for the no. of commonly shared,
differentially expressed genes. z-values are visualized by color intensity. The
intensity of the color is dependent on the absolute value of the z-value. Data are
shown for z-values 1.96 (P value 0.05). Red represents positive z-values
(positive correlations), indicating that there are more overlapping genes than
would be expected by chance alone. Blue represents negative z-values (anti-
correlations), meaning there are less overlapping genes than expected by
chance alone. Black indicates a z-value 1.96 (P value 0.05), indicating no
similarity between the results in the 2 arrays.

humans, and CR8 is also effective at delaying tumor-related
mortality in mice, including death from liver tumors (see
DISCUSSION; Refs. 10, 44). Thus these CR8- and MET-respon-
sive genes may have a key role in suppressing tumor-related
mortality.
To further statistically quantify the overlap between LTCR
and the treatments, the differentially expressed genes were
analyzed using t-tests and Venn Mapper (Fig. 1). At a signif-
icance of z 2, MET and CR8 again yielded the highest
number of genes overlapping LTCR (349 and 218, respec-
tively). The other treatments produced fewer such genes [ROS
(120 genes), GM (118 genes), GLIP (79 genes), and SOY (15
genes)]. These results again indicate that MET reproduces the
effects of LTCR even better than CR8.
To further assess the similarity of the effects of MET, CR8,
and LTCR responses, the z-values generated by Venn Mapper
were visualized as a heat map (Fig. 2). Examination of the data
in this way confirmed that the co-regulated genes were upregu-
lated and downregulated similarly by the treatments. Thus, at a
high level of statistical stringency, the gene expression re-
sponse to MET is highly similar to LTCR, as indicated by both
the number of overlapping genes and the direction of their
regulation. This overlap is significantly greater than that of any
of the other drugs. On the basis of these data, MET appeared
to be the most promising candidate CR mimetic.
Comparative analysis of the efficacy of the treatments at
increasing fold change cutoffs. To further explore the similar-
ity between LTCR and the treatments, we determined the
number of LTCR-like changes in gene expression at increasing
fold change thresholds (Fig. 3). At increasing levels of strin-
gency, MET, followed by CR8, maintained the most overlap
with LTCR. Thus, by this metric, MET induced a transcription
profile that was more like LTCR than the other treatments,
including CR8.
Analysis of the overlap between the treatments at increasing
statistical stringency. The overlap between LTCR and the
treatments was also examined by directly increasing the level
of statistical stringency (Fig. 4). MET, followed distantly by
CR8, maintained the highest number of overlapping genes at
increasing z-values. At z 22, MET treatment produced 300
changed genes, whereas the other treatments, including CR8,
produced no changes. Thus, with increasing statistical strin-
gency, MET better duplicated LTCR than did any other treat-
ment, including CR8.
Comparative functional analysis using GO terms. To further
explore the similarities between the treatments and LTCR, we
used GenMAPP and MAPPFinder on the output of VennMAP-
PER to create an unbiased estimate of their overlapping phys-
iological effects. The number of GO terms common to LTCR
and the treatments is a quantitative measure of their functional
similarity. MET produced the highest number of GO terms
overlapping those of LTCR, again outstripping even CR8 (Fig.
5). These results predict substantial physiological similarity
between the effects of MET and LTCR.
Effects of GLIP on gene expression are dominant over those
of MET. GLIP is an insulin secretagogue. The major hepatic
effects of MET include insulin sensitization, reduction of
gluconeogenesis, and enhancement of glucose utilization.
Here, we found that administration of GLIP together with MET
reduced the number of MET-responsive, LTCR-like changes in
gene expression found by multiclass SAM from 3,092 to 718,
a 77% reduction (Fig. 6). In contrast, MET reduced the number
of LTCR-like changes in gene expression induced by GLIP by
about one-half. The reduced number of MET-responsive genes
may be the result of GLIP-enhanced insulin secretion, since

changes in blood glucose levels per se have few effects on
hepatic gene expression (20).
Effects of the treatments on the weights of the mice. Changes
in body weight cannot explain the results obtained here. There
was no significant difference in the body weights of the groups
(Table 1). Moreover, the drug-treated and control mice con-
sumed the same number of calories. We inspected the cages for
any signs of uneaten food before each feeding and found none.
The mice assigned to the MET group weighed on average the
same as the control mice. Thus the drug-induced microarray
profiles result from the treatments themselves.
DISCUSSION
We investigated the hypothesis that global changes in gene
expression identified using high-density microarrays can be
used as surrogate biomarkers for the identification of candidate
CR mimetics. We tested this hypothesis by screening a number
of glucoregulatory pharmaceuticals and a putative chemopre-
ventative for their effects on hepatic gene expression in mice.
We found that 8 wk of MET treatment produced a gene
expression profile that overlapped LTCR to an even greater
extent than the profile produced by 8 wk of CR. We have
shown previously that CR begins to enhance lifespan and
reduce tumor incidence within 8 wk of its initiation (10). MET
matched 75% of the gene expression changes induced by
LTCR and 92% of the changes produced by CR8. Thus the
analyses described here indicate that MET is a promising
candidate CR mimetic.
The homology between the MET and CR profiles is consis-
tent with the similarities in their effects on circulating insulin
levels and tissue insulin sensitivity (13, 30). CR lowers blood
glucose levels, thereby reducing circulating insulin levels,
leading to enhanced tissue insulin sensitivity. MET enhances
liver, muscle, and fat insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic
glucose output, leading to lower blood glucose and insulin
levels (30). Most of the gene expression effects of CR and
MET may be due to reductions in serum insulin levels, since
blood glucose levels may not alter hepatic gene expression
(20). However, ROS treatment also lowered serum insulin
levels by approximately one-half (unpublished results) but did
not produce as many CR-like effects on gene expression.
These results suggest that additional changes in physiology
also may be reflected in the overlapping expression profiles
of CR and MET.
Health effects of MET. LTCR has long been known to
reduce the incidence, progression, and growth of cancer, in part
by increasing the rate of apoptosis in mitotically competent,
and therefore more cancer-prone, tissues (27). Recently, we
have shown that CR rapidly reduces the rate of growth (and
perhaps onset) of tumors (10). Consistent with the evidence
presented here, chronic MET treatment of female transgenic
HER-2/neu mice increased their mean lifespan by 8% and their
maximum lifespan by 13% (3). It also significantly reduced the
incidence and size of mammary adenocarcinomas and in-
creased the mean latency of the tumors. Phenformin, a chem-
ical cousin of MET, extends lifespan of C3H mice by 23%
while reducing tumor incidence by 80% (2, 16). Further, MET
treatment may be associated with reduced cancer risk in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes (19). MET completely protects
hamsters fed a high-fat diet from malignant, hyperplastic, and
premalignant pancreatic lesions (40). Indirect evidence sug-
gests that signaling through AMP-activated protein kinase may
mediate both the anti-diabetic and inhibitory effects of MET on
cancer cell growth and division (25). AMP-activated protein
kinase may be involved in regulating the lifespan of Caeno-
rhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and yeast (4, 24, 49). MET is
also effective in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome
(26). Finally, MET therapy has been shown to inhibit the
development of metabolic syndrome in humans, which is
associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular- and diabetes-
associated morbidity and mortality (37). Together, these results
suggest that microarray biomarkers can be used to identify
promising candidate CR mimetics.
Probable function of the MET- and CR-responsive genes.
The above conclusions assume that each of the transcriptional
responses to CR are of approximately equal importance to its
physiological effects. There are a number of lines of evidence
supporting this assumption. First, like many of the genetic
mutations known to extend lifespan, CR induces a substantial
number of changes in gene expression (32). Most lifespan-
extending mutations are in signal transduction-related genes,

which regulate batteries of other genes. For example, the Ames
dwarf mutation acts additively with LTCR to extend lifespan
and change the expression of a substantial number of genes
(50). Thus changes in the expression of significant numbers of
genes appear to be linked to the lifespan and anti-cancer effects
of most or all of the known lifespan interventions. Second, 8
wk of CR is sufficient to initiate its anti-cancer effects in the
liver (10). Eight weeks of MET treatment reproduced 75% of
the gene expression effects of LTCR and 92% of the effects of
CR8 in liver. Furthermore, essentially all of these CR-induced
changes were reversed by 8 wk of control feeding. Thus the
gene expression effects of LTCR and CR8 are linked tempo-
rally to their biological effects. Third, the lifespan extension
and anti-disease effects of CR are highly pleiotropic. For
example, they clearly differ in liver and heart (10, 11, 44). In
concert with these observations, the gene expression changes
in liver and heart are different and numerous but easily recon-
ciled with their tissue-specific physiological effects (10, 11,
44). Thus many of the overlapping gene expression effects of
MET, LTCR, and CR8 may produce or result from similarities
in their physiological effects.
GO terms. The transcriptional response of the liver to LTCR
is well characterized in mice (7, 10, 14, 44, 46, 50). The
number of overlapping GO terms produced by the treatments is
an unbiased measure of their functional similarity. By this
measure, MET and LTCR are more similar functionally than
even CR8 and LTCR.
BINs contributing to the CR-mimicking effects of MET. The
co-regulation of genes by LTCR and MET implies that they
utilize common transcription factors and upstream effectors.
To further elucidate the functional similarities between the
treatments and LTCR, we utilized PathwayAssist. Of the 349
genes co-regulated by LTCR and MET, 206 could be mapped
to the ResNet database (version 3.0). These genes were used to
build BINs using “Common Regulators,” “Common Targets,”
and “Direct Interactions.” The major CR- and MET-associated
effector pathways identified by Common Regulators included
insulin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), fibroblast growth fac-
tor-2, epidermal growth factor, and elements of their related
signal transduction pathways, including Fos, Mapk1 and -8,
and P53.
Common Targets identified the major cellular processes
targeted by the CR-mimicking effects of MET as apoptosis and
cell survival, differentiation, cell proliferation, and focal con-
tact. Direct Interactions indicated that the predominant genetic
links between LTCR and MET are closely associated with
chaperones. The chaperone network was further analyzed us-
ing the “Expand Pathway” option. It identified downregulation
of the mostly endoplasmic reticulum chaperones TRA1,
HSPA5, GRP58, and DNAJB11 and the related transcription
factor XBP1 as major features of the CR-mimicking effects of
MET. These chaperones are involved in apoptosis, prolifera-
tion, differentiation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and other
cellular processes.
We previously found that CR negatively regulates endoplas-
mic reticulum chaperone expression in liver and several other
tissues (7, 10, 45, 48, 50). Chaperone overexpression reduces
apoptosis and promotes tumorigenesis, while underexpression
enhances apoptosis and prevents tumor formation (29, 47).
Chaperone overexpression also is associated with the acquisi-
tion of resistance to chemotherapeutics and cell-mediated im-
munity (8, 22, 23, 41, 47). Chaperones can inhibit key effectors
of the apoptotic machinery including the apoptosome, the
caspase activation complex, and apoptosis-inducing factors
(21). For example, HSPA5 (also known as BiP and GRP78)
inhibits proapoptotic signaling in part by directly blocking
caspase activation (38). These overlapping effects are consis-
tent with the anti-cancer effects of MET and CR.
Other potential regulators of apoptosis and tumorigenesis.
Lifespan extension by CR and disrupted IGF-I signaling is
associated with reduced serum insulin levels and increased
insulin sensitivity (13). MET is an insulin-sensitizing agent
with potent anti-hyperglycemic actions (30). Consistent with
these properties, Common Regulators identified insulin as a
major regulatory factor in both MET and LTCR action. In
addition to its glucoregulatory actions and its effects on energy
and lipid metabolism, insulin can also be a mitogen or a
regulator of apoptosis. Signaling by insulin and the other
effectors discussed above converges on the early growth re-
sponse-1 (ERG1) gene, which increased expression in CR- and
MET-treated mice. Signaling through mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase-1 (MAPK1), MAPK8, FOS, and transformation-
related protein 53 (TP53; also known as p53), which were also
implicated by Common Regulators in the action of both MET
and LTCR, also converges on ERG1. ERG1 is a zinc finger,
nuclear localized, positive transcription factor that acts as a
tumor suppressor. Thus positive regulation of ERG1 may
mediate part of the carcinoprotective effects of CR and MET.
MAPK1 has a central role in the induction of apoptosis in
response to various stressors, as does MAPK8, which is re-
quired for the cytochrome c-mediated cell death pathway
(induced by TNF and UV radiation). FOS family members
are also associated with apoptotic cell death, as well as with
proliferation and differentiation. Likewise, TP53, a tumor sup-
pressor, plays an essential role in the regulation of the cell
cycle and apoptosis. Regulation by TNF and TP53 converges
on caspase 6 (CASP6), which was induced by both MET and
LTCR. CASP6 is thought to function downstream in the
caspase activation cascade.
According to Common Regulators, epidermal growth factor
and nerve growth factor- (NGFB) regulation converges on
programmed cell death 4 and neoplastic transformation inhib-
itor (PDCD4), which was induced by both LTCR and MET.
PDCD4 encodes a nuclear-localized tumor suppressor that
appears to play a major role in the regulation of apoptosis.
NGFB is also associated with HSPA5 regulation. The potential
TNF-mediated induction of I	B kinase- (CHUK) is another
link between LTCR, MET, and apoptosis identified by Com-
mon Regulators. CHUK phosphorylates the I	B family, mark-
ing them for ubiquitination and degradation, which can lead to
the induction of apoptosis. TANK-binding kinase 1 is another
NF	B-related gene induced by both LTCR and MET. The
protein encoded by this gene is similar to the I	B kinases. It
can mediate NF	B activation in response to growth factors by
releasing it from inhibition by the I	B proteins TANK and
TRAF2. Another proapoptotic effect of LTCR and MET is
downregulation of TRAF4, which mediates signal transduction
by members of the TNF receptor superfamily. This protein
interacts with the neurotrophin receptor, p75 (also known as
NTR/NTSR1) and antagonizes NF	B activation and NTR-
induced cell death.

In conclusion, the studies described herein show that high-
density microarray profiles of gene expression in the liver of
LTCR mice can be used to screen compounds and identify
potential CR mimetics. These results suggest that drugs capa-
ble of reproducing some or all of the life- and healthspan-
extending effects of CR may be identified in this manner. They
also indicate that MET is a potential CR mimetic.
