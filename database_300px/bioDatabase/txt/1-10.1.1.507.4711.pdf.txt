Abstract In sensory saltation, first reported by Gel-
dard and Sherrick (1972), a stimulus is displaced to-
wards a second one following closely in time and space
as a function of the delay between the stimuli. The dis-
tance between stimulus locations is restricted by the
extension of sensory fields in the primary somatosen-
sory cortex. Saltation is assumed to reflect dynamic
changes in these cortical representations. The present
study demonstrates for the first time saltation in ther-
moceptive and nociceptive pathways with CO2 laser
stimulation. Stimuli were presented to the dorsal fore-
arms of 18 healthy subjects at two intensities. Salta-
tion patterns consisted of a reference stimulus S0
near the wrist, the first test stimulus S1 at the ref-
erence location after a fixed onset delay of 1000ms,
and a second test stimulus S2 at a location 105mm
distant from reference after a variable onset delay of
60–516ms. Perceived positions were indicated by the
subjects without skin contact with a 3D tracker. As ex-
pected, subjects mislocalized S1 towards S2. Mean S1
displacement was 51±36mm. Decreasing delays be-
tween S1 and S2 resulted in increasing displacements,
independent of intensity. However, since no clear-cut
discrimination of thermal vs. nociceptive activation
could be achieved definite conclusions about differ-
ences between the two modalities cannot be drawn.
In addition, effects of body site on the saltation char-
acteristics were observed. The saltation paradigm

Introduction
Saltation is an illusion that consists in distortions
in the spatial perception of stimuli presented
in spatiotemporal patterns on the skin: the per-
ceived displacement of a stimulus is dependent
on the time interval to a second stimulus pre-
sented at a distant location (Geldard and Sher-
rick 1972; Geldard 1975; Cholewiak and Collins
2000). The phenomenon is restricted to a cer-
tain distance between the presented stimuli, the
so-called ‘saltatory area’, which is related to the
cortical magnification factor (Geldard and Sher-
rick 1983). Saltation was first demonstrated in
the tactile modality (Geldard and Sherrick 1972),
but it exists also in the visual and auditory sys-
tems (Lockhead et al. 1980; Shore et al. 1998)
and seems to represent a common property of
sensory networks in the CNS. Saltation has been
implemented in several variations. The origi-
nal publication focused on the ‘multiple rabbit’
paradigm, where multiple tactors were arranged
on the arm and the illusion of a series of jumps
from wrist to shoulder was elicited (Geldard and
Sherrick 1972). However, the main principles of
this illusion can be demonstrated best with the
so-called ‘reduced rabbit’ paradigm, which con-
1
sists of three stimuli presented at two locations
(cf. Fig. 1).
The psychophysically well-defined saltation il-
lusion offers potentials as a research tool for
the assessment of the somatosensory perceptual
space (the ‘body map’). Wiemer et al. (2000)
introduced a neuronal network model explain-
ing cortical topography from the spatiotemporal
characteristics of incoming stimuli, and argued
that the saltation phenomenon may be the per-
ceptual correlate of the dynamic behavior of sen-
sory maps. From this perspective, saltation is
the result of dynamic changes in the perceptual
space where the distance between two stimuli
in the body representation is a function of their
temporal pattern, and the saltatory area is con-
nected to receptive fields. Consequently, salta-
tion also offers the possibility to assess changes
in the spatial representation and the dynamic
characteristics in the somatosensory cortex due
to plastic processes. This is corroborated by the
finding that the size of the saltatory area is not
only dependent on the body site but that it can be
modified by repeated stimulation (Stolle 2004),
consistent with reports on alterations in cortical
receptive field size under repetitive stimulation
and chronic pain (Flor et al. 1998; Braun et al.
2000).
In the present study, the ‘reduced rabbit’
paradigm (Geldard 1975) was implemented for
the first time with cutaneous CO2 laser stim-
uli. Our goal was to elicit saltation in the ther-
moceptive and nociceptive domain without any
tactile stimulation. CO2 laser stimuli are suit-
able to activate nociceptive Aδ- and C-fibers as
well as thermoceptive C-fibers without activating
mechanoceptors (Bromm and Treede 1984). Fur-
thermore, CO2 laser beams are invisible, thus
providing us with a technique to assess subjec-
tive localization data independent from visual
cues. We expect that the technique described in
this article adds a valuable tool to the investiga-
tion of alterations in the cortical representation
of thermoceptive and nociceptive information.
Materials and methods
Subjects
Eighteen healthy subjects took part in the study
(14 male). Mean age was 25.6±4.9 years (range
19–35). Sixteen subjects were right-handed, one
was left-handed, and one subject showed no clear
preference for either side, as assessed by the Ed-
inburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield 1971).
All subjects were informed and gave written con-
sent according to the declaration of Helsinki. The
study design was approved by the local ethics
committee.
Apparatus for stimulus application
and psychophysical scaling
Subjects sat down in a chair and the arm sched-
uled for stimulation was fixed by a vacuum pillow.
Infrared laser pulses of 20ms duration were ap-
plied by a CO2 laser system (Synrad 57-1, 100W,
Synrad Inc., Mukilteo, WA, U.S.A.). The area cov-
ered by the laser beam on the skin was approxi-
mately 44mm2. A visible low-power diode laser
beam collinear with the CO2 laser beam allowed
precise localization and adjustment of stimula-
tion sites. The laser beam was applied to the skin
via a computer-controlled mirror-scanner (GSI
Lumonics, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). Stimulus inten-
sity and location patterns were pre-programmed.
The shift from one location to another could be
performed in a matter of microseconds.
Laser energy was measured with a laser en-
ergy meter (Nova, Ophir Optronics Ltd. Wilm-
ington MA, U.S.A.). Peak surface temperatures
on the skin were calculated with a time constant
model using thermal properties of water (van
Gemert and Welch 1989; Brugmans et al. 1991).
Perceived positions of the stimuli on the skin
were indicated by the subject by pointing at them
with the tip of a 3D tracker system (Polhemus Fas-
trak II) without skin contact. A one-dimensional
scale in proximal-distal direction was anchored
to the stimulation area on the forearm. The per-
pendicular of the three-dimensional coordinates
to this scale constituted the position information
used in the analysis.
Sensory thresholds procedure
The individual detection thresholds and pain
thresholds of single laser pulses (duration 20ms)
were assessed at two sites within the radial
nreve area on the dorsum of the right hand (see
Fig. 1) with two ascending series in steps of
2
1.0mJ/mm2. This area was chosen to reduce
adaptation/sensitization biases during the salta-
tion procedure on the arm. After each stimulus,
subjects were asked if they could detect the stim-
ulus, if it was perceived as warm, hot, stinging
(pin-prick), or unpleasant. If the stimulus was
judged unpleasant, subjects were asked if it was
painful. Each ascending series was terminated
at the first ‘painful’ rating. If a painful sensation
could not be achieved at 17.0mJ/mm2 (corre-
sponding to a temperature change of 26.3 °C)
the series was nonetheless aborted, because
higher intensities were not scheduled for the
saltation procedure to avoid skin damage and
adaptation/sensitization effects. The lowest de-
tected intensity in the two trials constituted the
detection threshold. The highest ‘painful’ inten-
sity reported during the two trials was chosen
as the pain threshold to account for the rapid
habituation to laser stimuli. Further spot checks
of the stimulus quality were performed during
the saltation procedure.
Saltation procedure and design
The experimental design consisted of the factors
intensity (two steps) and delay (seven steps) with
a four-step repetition factor. A fourth factor, po-
sition, was confounded with delay and repetition
due to the balancing method described below.
The stimulus sequence was first presented
on the right dorsal arm at low intensities
of 3.5mJ/mm2 above the individual detection
threshold. Then it was presented on the left
dorsal arm with higher intensities, usually at
1.7mJ/mm2 above the individual pain threshold,
but never above 17.3mJ/mm2 to avoid the risk of
skin damage.
Fourteen different pairs of stimulus locations
were arranged in a matrix of 20mm× 165mm
located in the radial nerve area in the C7 der-
matome (Fig. 1). The stimulation patterns con-
sisted of three stimuli (duration 20ms) which
were arranged according to the ‘reduced rabbit’
scheme (Fig. 1, inset; cf. Geldard 1975). The
first stimulus S0 was presented at the location
L0, followed by the second stimulus S1 with a
fixed time interval of 1000ms at the same loca-
tion (L1=L0). The third stimulus S2 followed
at location L2, at a fixed distance of 105mm
apart from L0/L1. The delay between the onset
of S1 and S2 was 60ms, 100ms, 140ms, 180ms,
220ms, 366ms, or 516ms. The first stimulus
was always presented at the most distal position
in the pattern.
Each delay value was repeated four times.
To avoid habituation of the skin, stimulus loca-
tions were shifted laterally (x-direction: 0mm or
20mm) and in wrist-elbow (y-) direction (from
0mm to 60mm, in 10mm increments), resulting
in the stimulation matrix depicted in Fig. 1. The
delay/position combinations and their sequence
in the experimental protocol were balanced to
minimize effects of expectation by alternating
high and low delays and proximal and distal po-
sitions in a fixed order. Because not every sin-
gle delay could be combined with every single
position, we decided to use the scheme shown
in Table 1 to at least achieve uniform ‘mean’
y-positions for every delay. This method con-
founded the interaction of delay and repetition
with stimulus position in the y-direction so that
delay and position effects had to be tested in
separate analysis (see Statistics section).
After each trial, subjects were asked how many
stimuli they had detected. Then they were in-
structed to mark the perceived locations (P0,
P1, and P2) of these stimuli with the 3D tracker
without actually touching the skin to avoid the
establishment of concurrent sensory reference
points. As all stimulus locations were aligned to
the one-dimensional 3D tracker scale in distal-
proximal direction (y), shifts in lateral direction
(x) were not taken into account for the data anal-
ysis. If more than three pulses were detected, P0
and P2 were defined as the most distal and proxi-
mal detections, while P1 was defined as the most
proximal of the intermediate values. For the anal-
ysis of the saltation effect trials with only one
or two detections were discarded, since it was
not possible to assign the subjects’ responses
unambiguously to the three presented stimuli.
Each of the 14 intensity/delay combinations
was repeated four times in 18 subjects, resulting
in a data matrix with 2×7×4×18=1008 cells.
In the classic tactile experiments (Geldard and
Sherrick 1972; Geldard 1975), the displacement
of S1 was measured as a proportion of the dis-
tance defined by the fixed positions of the first
and the last stimulus on the skin (L0 and L2),
which were visible to the subjects. With this par-
titioning technique with P0 and P2 anchored to

L0 and L2, only variations of the perceived loca-
tion of S1 were assessed. In the present study,
no visual cues for the physical location of S0 and
S2 were available to the subjects, so the percep-
tion of their locations as measured by P0 and P2
could also vary. Distances between the perceived
positions P0, P1 and P2 served as basis of analy-
sis. Relative S1 displacement was defined as the
distance between P0 and P1 as a percentage of
the distance between endpoints P0 and P2.
Statistics
The multi-factorial repeated-measurements de-
sign was analyzed by maximum-likelihood-
estimated linear mixed models (Littell et al.
1998). This method has significant advan-
tages compared to classic MANOVA repeated-
measures analyses, as missing values are al-
lowed to enter the analysis and the model can
be fitted to the repetition-dependent autoregres-
sions found in the data. Two separate models
were fitted, one including intensity, delay and
repetition, the other with intensity, position and
repetition as experimental and control factors,
thus separating the main factors delay and po-
sition confounded by the balancing of stimulus
combinations over repetitions (see previous sec-
tion). The significance level was set to 5% with
sequential adjustments for multiple testing (Ben-
jamini and Hochberg 1995). Location tests were
performed with Student’s t statistics. Differ-
ences in frequency were tested with χ2 tech-
niques. Results are reported as means ± stan-
dard deviations. Data processing and calcula-
tions were performed with the SAS® System for
Windows®, Release 8.2, and R for Windows®,
Version 1.8.1 (R Development Core Team 2003).
Results
Thresholds, perceived intensities,
and detected stimuli
Mean thresholds, mean energies for the two in-
tensity conditions, and corresponding calculated
temperature changes are listed in Table 2. Dur-
ing the threshold procedure with the maximum
intensity set to 17.3mJ/mm2, ‘unpleasant’ sensa-
tions could be elicited in 13 out of 18 subjects,
additional ‘painful’ sensations in eight subjects.
The quality of the sensations on the dorsal
forearm during the experiment was assessed by
spot checks. The perceptual qualities on the arm
reflected those assessed on the hand satisfacto-
rily: At the lower intensity which corresponded
to a mean peak temperature rise from baseline
skin temperature of 15.3 °C ten subjects (56%)
reported ‘unpleasant’ sensations, four subjects
(22%) reported ‘unpleasant’ and ‘painful’ sensa-
tions. At the higher intensity with mean peak
temperature changes of 25.4 °C ‘unpleasant’ sen-
sations were reported by sixteen subjects (89%),
accompanied by ‘painful’ sensations in ten sub-
jects (56%). In two subjects, intensity had to be
set to a lower value in the high-intensity condi-
tion, because sensations reached the individual
tolerance threshold.
In only 3 of the total of 1008 trials no stimulus
at all was detected, one pulse was detected in
147 trials (15%), two pulses were detected in
516 trials (51%), and three or more pulses in
342 trials (34%). Intensity improved the amount
of stimulus detections significantly (McNemar
χ2 test, p< .001): Three or more pulses were
detected in 115 of 504 trials (23%) at the lower
stimulation intensity, whereas in 227 of 504 tri-
als (45%) at the higher intensity. The amount
of trials with three or more detected stimuli
grew slightly smaller with repetition in the high-
intensity condition (Cochran χ2 test, p< .05), but
not in the low-intensity condition. The y-position
had no significant effect on the amount of trials
with three or more detections at either intensity
(Cochran χ2 tests, n.s.).
Five subjects had general difficulties in detect-
ing the stimuli: In this subgroup, three or more
pulses were detected only in two low-intensity
trials (1%) and in six high-intensity trials (4%),
thus biasing the overall percentage of trials with
three detected stimuli. However, there was no
difference in the number of trials with two de-
tected stimuli compared to the other subjects.
Due to technical artifacts from the 3D tracker
arising from rapid hand movements by the sub-
jects 47 trials of the 342 trials with three or more
detected stimuli had to be discarded, leaving 295
trials for the analysis of the saltation effect.

Saltation characteristics
As predicted, the stimulus S1 was perceived at a
position different from that of S0 in the direction
towards S2 in almost every single trial with three
or more detected pulses. The absolute mean
deviation of P1 from P0 was 51±36mm. The
mean relative S1 displacement was 51±27% and
it increased linearly with decreasing delay (Fig.
2). A linear mixed model analysis for the factors
intensity, delay, and repetition showed that only
the delay between S1 and S2 yielded a significant
effect on the relative displacement of S1 (Table
3).
The second linear mixed model analysis includ-
ing the factors intensity, position, and repetition
showed also a significant effect of stimulus po-
sition on the lower arm, that is, the relative dis-
placement of S1 increased linearly with more
proximal stimulus sites (Table 3, Fig. 3). This
means that the relative S1 displacement not only
changed with the delay between S1 and S2, as
reported in the older literature, but depended
also on the absolute position on the arm.
Representation of the stimulated
area
Since there was no visual cue for the locations
of S0 and S2, subjects’ perception of these loca-
tions was free to vary. The distance between the
perceived endpoints P0 and P2 of the stimula-
tion pattern decreased linearly from more distal
to more proximal stimulation sites on the fore-
arm (Fig. 4). In trials with S0 and S1 applied
close to the wrist (e.g. L0/L1 at y=0mm, cf. Fig.
1), the mean distance between P0 and P2 was
111±46mm and thus not significantly different
from the physical distance of 105mm between
L0/L1 and L2 (Student’s t, n.s.). In contrast, at
more proximal positions the distance between
the perceived positions was significantly smaller
than the physical distance (e.g. 84±35mm with
L0/L1 at y=60mm; Student’s t, p< .001). In
the linear mixed model analysis with the factors
intensity, position, and repetition as predictors,
the distance between P0 and P2 depended signif-
icantly on position, but not on the delay between
S1 and S2 (Table 2). There was a significant in-
teraction effect on P0–P2 distance between delay
and repetition which, however, only reflects an
artifact from the fixed sequence of stimulus com-
binations of the balancing method (cf. Methods
section).
Discussion
Saltation elicited by thermal
stimulation
This study demonstrated for the first time the
existence of the saltation phenomenon in the
processing of heat and pain stimuli without in-
volvement of touch sensations. The displace-
ment of the target stimulus S1 increased linearly
with decreasing delays of the following stimu-
lus S2 applied 105mm apart, which is in line
with the classic tactile studies (Geldard and Sher-
rick 1972; Geldard 1975; Cholewiak and Collins
2000) as well as with more recent results (Stolle
2004). The observed systematic deviations are
substantial, taking into account that the localiza-
tion accuracy of heat stimuli is almost as good as
in mechanoceptive sensation (Moore and Schady
1995; Schlereth et al. 2001).

except the balancing effect discussed in the Methods and Results sections.
Apart from the general correspondence, our
results differ in detail from the classic saltation
studies. In our experiment, even at the shortest
delay of 60ms high S1 displacements of up to
100% (‘coinicidence’) were rare. Further, even
at long delays of 516ms, displacements were
generally substantial, and a complete lack of
displacement (‘exodus’, e.g. S0 and S1 are per-
ceived at the same site) was observed only in a
negligible amount of trials. These results conflict
with the original experiments by Geldard and co-
workers (Geldard 1975), where at short delays
coincidence was regularly reported and at delays
above 300ms no displacement of S1 occurred.
To explain these discrepancies, the methodologi-
cal differences between our study and the clas-
sic reports have to be considered. In Geldard’s
original setup (a) the delays were manipulated
by the subjects to achieve a given displacement
(method of adjustment), and (b) the ‘endpoints’
P0 and P2 were visually anchored. If however
the same psychophysical scaling method as in
the present study is used, comparable results are
also yielded in tactile saltation (Stolle 2004).
The distance between the perceived locations
of the endpoints (P0, P2), that is, the perceived
length of the spatiotemporal stimulus pattern
decreased from distal to proximal sites on the
forearm (Fig. 4). At the most proximal pair of
stimulation sites it was only 80% of the physi-
cal distance. This phenomenon is known from
tactile saltation as well, where it is even more
prominent (Stolle 2004). It is unlikely that visual
perspective biases might have led to this effect,
as there were no visual anchor points for the
stimuli. The effect can rather be related to the
decreasing resolution of the cortical represen-
tation towards the elbow. Such differences in
the cortical magnification factor (Sur et al. 1980)
would also explain the increase of the relative
displacement of the ‘saltatory’ stimulus (S1) at
more proximal sites (cf. Table 3, Fig. 3; position
effect on relative S1 displacement): Due to the
decrease of the cortical magnification factor in
distal-proximal direction the same amount of dis-
placement in the cortical representation refers
to a larger proportion of the skin surface for ar-
eas near the elbow and to a smaller proportion
for areas near the wrist. Correspondingly, this
results in larger S1 displacements in perceptual
space for more proximal areas. However, this
question remains open to discussion, because to
our knowledge no systematic studies on the vari-
ability of RF sizes on the body surface have been
carried out for thermoception and nociception to
date.
Variations in intensity did not lead to substan-
tial differences in saltation characteristics (cf.
Table 3). The intensity dimension was originally
introduced to differentiate between thermal and
nociceptive activation. It is however disputable
if this discrimination could indeed be achieved,
as will be discussed in the following section.
Sensory networks involved in
thermal saltation
CO2 laser stimuli activate nociceptive Aδ and
C multimodal (mechano-heat) fibers (AMH-II,
CMH), but no mechanoceptors (Bromm and
Treede 1984). C-fiber warm receptors in hu-
mans respond to thermal stimuli up to 46 °C with
a peak discharge frequencies between 40 and
45 °C (Hensel 1981). Nociceptive AMH-II and
CMH fibers respond to temperatures starting
at 43 °C. AMH-II fiber activation is known for a
well-detectable sharp pin-prick sensation (Koniet-
zny et al. 1981), also called ‘first pain’, whereas

displacement on delay (intercept: 113.41, slope:
–0.51). The high standard deviations result from
substantial interindividual differences, as well as
from the effect of different positions on the forearm
(cf. Fig. 3).
CMH fibers are responsible for the dull, burning
‘second pain’ component (Ochoa and Torebjörk
1989). Low intensity stimulation of nociceptive
fibers leads to non-painful ‘pre-pain’ sensations;
temporal and/or spatial summation of several
activations is needed to result in a subjective
experience of pain (Pertovaara et al. 1988).
The laser pulses used in our study induced
mean peak temperature changes of 15 °C in the
low-intensity condition and 25 °C in the high-
intensity condition (cf. Table 2). Assuming a
baseline skin temperature of 30 °C, a typical low-
intensity pulse resulted in peak skin tempera-
tures around 45 °C and thus probably both ther-
moceptor and nociceptor activations, whereas
high-intensity pulses reached peak temperatures
of more than 55 °C where thermoceptor activa-
tion can be discounted.
Consequently, the failure to find significant
differences in saltation characteristics between
the two intensity conditions can possibly be ex-

plained by the fact that a clear-cut discriminina-
tion between thermal and nociceptive activation
could not be achieved. Thus, we can draw no
final conclusions on saltation characteristics of
exclusive thermoceptor activation. It is however
safe to say that a concurrent activation of the
both systems, as present in the low intensity
condition does not lead to results different from
exclusive nociceptor activation.
Cortical areas commonly activated by laser
stimuli include the insula, the anterior cingulate
cortex, suprasylvian areas, and the postcentral
gyrus (cf. Garcia-Larrea et al. 2003). The latter
is of particular interest for the explanation of the
saltation effect. As discussed before, tactile salta-
tion is thought to result from activation patterns
in the primary somatosensory cortex (Geldard
1975; Wiemer et al. 2000). The representation
of nociceptive and thermal stimuli in the post-
central gyrus is somatotopically organized, and
activation was found close to the correspond-
ing tactile activations (Chatt and Kenshalo 1977;
Tarkka and Treede 1993; Andersson et al. 1997),

Ordinate: mean distance between the perceived
positions of S0 and S2 (P0 and P2) with standard
deviations; abscissa: position of L0/L1 on the lower
arm (cf. Fig. 1); bars: standard deviations of the
raw data; dashed line: fitted linear regression curve
curve (intercept: 48.06, slope: 0.10). The distance
between the two endpoints of the stimulus pattern
decreased significantly towards higher (more proxi-
mal) positions (cf. Table 3).
however outside the somatosensory representa-
tion in areas 3b and 1, presumably rather in area
3a (Ohara et al. 2004). These findings suggest
that a ‘body map’ for warmth and/or pain exists
next to the tactile representation, basically shar-
ing its somatotopical characteristics.
Limitations
The full set of three stimuli applied in one salta-
tion trial was detected in 342 trials only, repre-
senting 34% of the total sample. However, two
pulses at two distinct locations were detected in
another 51% of all trials. The consistent reports
of at least two separate perceived locations in
85% of the trials show that subjects detected
pulses from both stimulation sites in a majority
of cases. Nonetheless, one of the three pulses
frequently remained undetected.
It is known that the S1 stimulus is usually per-
ceived as less intense than S0 and S2 (Geldard
1975), thus we suppose that in most of the cases
it was S1 that was missed by the subjects. Fa-
tigue in AMH-II and CMH fibers possibly con-
tributes to this effect (cf. Treede et al. 1995;
Olausson 1998). It is however questionable if
fatigue alone can explain the large amount of
missed S1 stimuli, considering that repetitive
laser stimulation at 1 Hz rather leads to an in-
crease in perceived intensity (Trojan et al. 2002),
probably due to spinal ‘windup’ (Mendell 1966).
A more detailed study of backward and for-
ward masking effects in spatiotemporal stimu-
lation paradigms is needed to clarify this issue
and reduce dropout rates. In this connection,
individual differences in detecting complex stim-
ulus patterns should also be taken into account,
since a subgroup of our subjects barely detected
a third pulse at all but did not substantially differ
from the rest of the sample otherwise.
Assessment of cortical
representations with
spatiotemporal stimulus patterns
Contrary to the static model of SI topography
by Penfield and Rasmussen (1950), cortical rep-
resentations (‘body maps’) are dynamic, i.e. de-
pendent on spatiotemporal characteristics of in-
coming stimuli. This ability to adapt the sizes of
cortical receptive fields to changing sensory in-
put is well-known to come into effect as a result
of regular training (Rockstroh et al. 1998), repeti-
tive stimulation (Godde et al. 1996; Shimojo et al.
2000), or amputations and nerve damage (Flor
et al. 1998; Ramachandran and Hirstein 1998).
However, the causes for plastic changes do not
have to be this massive. Focusing the subjects’ at-
tention to specific positions may be sufficient for
cortical reorganization (Braun et al. 2000). The
saltation effect itself is an example for dynamic
(mal-)adaptation on a much smaller time scale.
But even a few repetitions of such stimulation
patterns seem to be sufficient to trigger lasting
biases in perception (Stolle 2004). Perhaps plas-
ticity in spatial representations can be described
in stages of activation-dependency, modulation,
and modification, similar to those introduced by
Woolf and Salter (2000) for the plasticity in pain
intensity.
At present, somatosensory representations—
and their dynamics—are almost solely evaluated
9
by neuroimaging approaches in humans. Ade-
quate methods to identify the perceptual equiva-
lents of spatial changes in the sensory cortices
and their temporal dynamics are needed as func-
tional correlates. This is of particular importance
for investigating the development of chronic pain
after injury and may apply as well to functional
pain and other disorders with altered body per-
ception possibly related to distorted ‘body maps’
or disturbed somatic and visceral integration
as in the irritable bowel syndrome (Mayer and
Raybould 1990; Hölzl et al. 1998a; Hölzl et al.
1998b).
We suggest that the saltation technique can
serve as a tool for the psychophysical assess-
ment of ‘body maps’. Given that the size of the
saltatory area is indeed related to the size of cor-
tical receptive fields (Geldard 1985; Wiemer et
al. 2000), the spatial representation in the cor-
tex can be mapped by assessing saltatory field
sizes. Differences between different modalities—
e.g. tactile vs. nociceptive—may be assessed and
interindividual differences of saltatory areas and
other saltation characteristics may be used to
indicate and/or predict maladaptive cortical re-
organization. Recent findings on altered tactile
illusions in chronic pain patients (Gonzales et
al. 2001) justify further investigation of these
questions.
Conclusion
In the present study, saltation was demonstrated
for the first time with CO2 laser stimulation. The
results support the view that saltation is a gen-
eral phenomenon in the sensory system. Salta-
tion stimuli and other spatiotemporal stimulation
techniques have the potential to make a substan-
tial and innovative contribution to the functional
analysis of the nociceptive system. Applications
include basic psychophysical experiments and
neuroimaging applications as well as the assess-
ment of stimulus-response characteristics in clin-
ical groups.
