ABSTRACT
Synthetic Biology, a multidisciplinary field, is
growing rapidly. Improving the understanding of
biological systems through mimicry and producing
bio-orthogonal systems with new functions are two
complementary pursuits in this field. A web server
called FMM (From Metabolite to Metabolite) was
developed for this purpose. FMM can reconstruct
metabolic pathways form one metabolite to another
metabolite among different species, based mainly
on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) database and other integrated biological
databases. Novel presentation for connecting differ-
ent KEGG maps is newly provided. Both local and
global graphical views of the metabolic pathways
are designed. FMM has many applications in
Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering. For
example, the reconstruction of metabolic pathways
to produce valuable metabolites or secondary meta-
bolites in bacteria or yeast is a promising strategy
for drug production. FMM provides a highly effective
way to elucidate the genes from which species
should be cloned into those microorganisms
based on FMM pathway comparative analysis.
Consequently, FMM is an effective tool for applica-
tions in synthetic biology to produce both drugs and
biofuels. This novel and innovative resource is now
freely available at http://FMM.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.
INTRODUCTION
Synthetic Biology, a rapidly growing multidisciplinary
ﬁeld, has two complementary goals- further elucidating
biological systems through mimicry and producing bio-
orthogonal systems with new functions (1). Microbes are
well established as eﬀective hosts for the biosynthesis of
bio-molecules; consequently, engineered microbial biolog-
ical systems represent critical frontier in synthetic biology
(2). Engineered microorganisms are employed in numer-
ous applications, including food additives, pharmaceuti-
cals, fuels, animal feed supplements, cosmetics and
polymer materials (3,4). For example, Corynebacterium
glutamicum and Escherichia coli are used to produce
lysine, methionine, valine and threonine (3,5–8) which
are essential intermediate precursors for antibiotics (9)
and biofuels (10). These beneﬁts have motivated scientists
to design and construct new biological components
(such as enzymes, genetic circuits, metabolic pathways
and cells) and redesign existing biological systems (11).
Furthermore, synthetic biology can be modeled, under-
stood, and tuned to meet particular performance criteria,
and smaller components can be assembled into larger inte-
grated systems that solve speciﬁc problems (11). Hence,
more bioinformatics tools have been created recently for
applications in metabolic engineering.
Since 1995, Kanehisa et al. has been developing knowl-
edge-based methods for elucidating higher-order systemic
behaviors of cells and organisms from genomic and molec-
ular information (12–15). They established the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
for integrating genomic, chemical, metabolic pathways,
and systemic functional information (12–15). MetaCyc
(16) is a non-redundant database and contains more
than 1100 experimentally elucidated metabolic pathways
from more than 1500 organisms; it provides a set of
reference data for computationally predicting metabolic
pathways. Several important databases of metabolic path-
ways exist with hundreds of metabolic pathways and thou-
sands of biochemical reactions; even the metabolic
pathways for a small organism constitutes a large net-
work, such as Roche Applied Science Biochemical
Pathways chart (17) and BRENDA (18). Although
numerous servers can reconstruct metabolic pathways

based on available metabolic maps, it is still inconvenient
to reconstruct metabolic pathways from two interesting
metabolites. For instance, determining the metabolic path-
way from glucose to pyruvate from those databases is
arduous unless the two metabolites are already known
to be involved in the glycolysis pathway. Moreover, only
one metabolite can be input to any of those servers, and
users need considerable time to ﬁnd a speciﬁc pathway
in which they are interested. In addition, comparative ana-
lysis of metabolic networks in various species yields
important information for many topics in biology and
life sciences, such as evolution and speciation, metabolic
engineering, and drug design.
Li et al. (19) adopted Metabolic Pathway Alignment
and Scoring (M-PAS) for identifying and ranking
conserved metabolic pathways based on a comprehen-
sive and ﬂexible similarity measuring method. The
Comparative Pathway Analyzer (CPA) calculates and
displays the diﬀerences between the metabolic reaction
contents of several organisms (20). The Roseobacter sys-
tems biology database (ROSY) represents an integrated
platform for studying the comparative genomics and sys-
tems biology of Roseobacter-related species (21).
However, even some of the resources for comparative ana-
lysis of metabolic pathways of various species focus on a
few species only or do not provide a convenient interface
for analysis.
The above considerations motivated the development of
a novel and easy resource for use in synthetic biology,
which is proposed herein. In this work, a new web
server, FMM (From Metabolite to Metabolite), was
designed to reconstruct metabolic pathways form one
metabolite to another among diﬀerent species, based
mainly on the KEGG database (12–15) and other inte-
grated biological databases. Even though KEGG maps
utilized in many metabolic tools, none of them can con-
nect metabolites from diﬀerent KEGG maps. FMM sup-
ports the connection of diﬀerent KEGG maps. Figure 1
depicts the basic concept of FMM which demonstrates
that FMM has numerous applications in synthetic biology
and metabolic engineering. For instance, the reconstruc-
tion of metabolic pathways to produce valuable metabo-
lites or secondary metabolites in bacteria or yeast is a
promising strategy for producing drugs. FMM provides
a very convenient way to elucidate which genes
from which species should be cloned into those microor-
ganisms based on FMM pathway comparative analysis.
Accordingly, FMM is an eﬀective tool in synthetic biology
and metabolic engineering, such as applications in drug
production and biofuel production.
METHODS
Figure 1 displays metabolic pathways that can be easily
reconstructed from two interesting metabolites among
various species using the FMM system. Figure 2 presents
the system ﬂow of FMM. A reaction matrix was devel-
oped to identify numerous reaction processes from one
metabolite to another. Enzyme annotations from
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (22) were employed to identify
enzymes from diﬀerent species in comparative analysis.
Data collection and integration
FMM reaction deﬁnitions, species-speciﬁc reactions, reac-
tion maps and enzyme lists were obtained from KEGG/
LIGAND and KEGG/PATHWAY database Release
Figure 1. A conceptual diagram of FMM.
W130 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37,Web Server issue
48.0, updated on 1 October 2008 (12–15). Some informa-
tion (including gene names, Enzyme Commission (EC)
numbers, and species-speciﬁc enzymes) was supplied
from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Release 14.0 (22) and
NCBI Taxonomy database (23,24). The data in the pro-
posed FMM will be updated regularly. The current meta-
bolites (including ATP, NADH, H2O and CO2) are
generally used as carriers for transferring electrons or cer-
tain functional groups (including phosphate group, amino
group, one carbon unit, and methyl group); they are like
the external metabolites that participate in many reactions
and are not in pseudo steady state in a sub-network. The
connections through current metabolites should be
avoided in calculating the path length from one metabolite
to another. Hence, the connections through current meta-
bolites and cofactors were deleted manually to make
the path length analysis physiologically more meaningful.
The current metabolites are displayed in Table S1 (See
Supplementary Data). However, some current metabolites
are primary metabolites. For example, asparate is not only
a current metabolite involved in transamination mech-
anism (oxaloacetate+NH3+NADPH=asparate+
NADP + H2O), but also a primary metabolite in biosyn-
thesis of amino acids. When the current metabolites are
involved in the primary pathway as primary metabolites,
such reactions and metabolites are collected in FMM.
Therefore, biosynthesis of amino acids can be conducted
in FMM.
Posttranslational modiﬁcation (PTM) is the chemical
modiﬁcation of a protein after its translation. In eukar-
yote, the PTM of amino acids extends numerous functions
of the protein involving protein structure change, such as
formation of disulﬁde bridges and regulation of transcrip-
tion. However, there is no PTM mechanism after protein
translation in prokaryote. Therefore, a functional enzyme
that needed PTM in eukaryote was no function when
cloning into prokaryote. It is important to know the
PTM information before cloning one gene from eukaryote
to prokaryote. dbPTM (25) is a database that compiles
information on protein post-translational modiﬁcations
(PTMs), such as the catalytic sites, solvent accessibility
of amino-acid residues, protein secondary and tertiary
structures, protein domains and protein variations.
Protein post-translational modiﬁcation (PTM) informa-
tion was extracted from dbPTM (25). The numbers of
collected metabolites, enzymes, reactions, species and
KEGG maps are 16 832, 2336, 4288, 1491 and 149 in
FMM, respectively.

Construction of reaction matrix
Information on reactions and enzymes was obtained from
KEGG pathway maps and the equations of each reaction
were determined. Therefore, a reaction matrix was con-
structed based on maps, reactions and enzymes data.
For instance, ‘R01731: Oxaloacetate + L-Arogenate
<=> L-Aspartate+Prephenate’ is converted into
‘R01731: C00036+C00826 <=> C00049 + C00254’
(where R01731 is KEGG reaction ID; C00036, C00826,
C00049 and C00254 are KEGG compound ID). The reac-
tion R01731 is a reversible reaction which is regarded as
two forward reactions in FMM. The direction of one for-
ward reaction is from C00254 to C00036 in the pathway
map, the other is from C00036 to C00254. The example
illustrate herein is only one forward reaction from C00254
to C00036. Therefore, four reactions are described below:
C00254 => C00826 1
C00254 => C00036 2
C00049 => C00826 3
C00049 => C00036 4
Each equation corresponds to an edge in a graph;
Figure S1 (See Supplementary Data) depicts an example
reaction matrix. FMM contains 16884 compounds; and so
the size of the reaction matrix is 1688416884. A direct path
graph of the reactions depends on the reaction matrix using
the breadth ﬁrst search (BFS) approach. As shown in
Figure S2 (See Supplementary Data), when the direct path
graphfromcompoundC00254tocompoundC00079 is iden-
tiﬁed by BFS, the search terminates when the C00079 node
isfound.Additionally,KEGGMODULEisanewcollection
of pathway modules, molecular complexes, and other func-
tional units, each represented as a list of KEGGOrthology
(KO) identiﬁers,whichwereused inpathway reconstruction
when the node was a KEGGMODULE.
Reconstruction of metabolic pathway from various KEGG
pathway maps
After all possible reaction paths were identiﬁed, the
number of pathway maps was calculated. Usually, found
paths occurred not in only a single pathway map, but in a
complicated fashion in several maps. Pathway maps that
contain the most paths are selected and the one pathway
map that has only one reaction is avoided. A matrix of
maps versus reactions was employed to reconstruct meta-
bolic pathway from diﬀerent KEGG maps. For example,
the pathway from C00254 to C00811 passes through sev-
eral reactions (paths) and maps, as described in Figure S3
(See Supplementary Data). It is better to select fewer
maps and fewer map exchanges to reconstruct metabolic
pathway. Therefore, based on the above example,
‘map00400 ! map00400 ! map00360 ! map00360’ is
much better than ‘map00400 ! map00400 ! map00960
! map00360’.
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Comparative analysis provided in FMM is useful in
synthetic biology. For example, the reconstruction of
metabolic pathways to produce valuable metabolites or
secondary metabolites in bacteria or yeast is a promising
biotechnological strategy. Comparative analysis provides
an easy way to elucidate which genes from which species
should be cloned into those microorganisms. First, the
enzymes identiﬁed in the reconstructed pathway were
processed to search for orthologous encoding genes from
various species. Then, the presence or absence of the path-
way in a particular species can be known. Furthermore,
comparative tables of several organisms are provided. The
species are ranked according to the numbers of enzymes
involved in the reconstructed pathway.
WEBSITE USAGE
Web Interface
Figure S4 (See Supplementary Data) presents the user-
friendly web interface of the FMM. In ‘Start FMM’,
two metabolites of interest (keyword or KEGG com-
pound ID) can be input and several species can be selected
from four categories (animals, plants, fungi and prokar-
yotic). The metabolic pathways corresponding to the two
input metabolites can be reconstructed, as given in
Figure S4A (See Supplementary Data). As to the compar-
ative analysis of metabolic pathways, Figure S4B (See
Supplementary Data) includes one species in the ‘major
species’ column (of microorganisms commonly used in
synthetic biology) and several in the ‘comparative species’
column (of several organisms in common use in the
laboratory). The comparative metabolic pathways
between various organisms are then generated. The out-
puts include two views of the metabolic pathway; one is a
vertical view (local view); the other highlights the meta-
bolic pathway in the KEGG map (global view), as shown
in Figure 3A and B, respectively. The EC number and
hyperlinks to detailed information (such as orthologous
enzymes and PTM) of the enzymes that are involved in
the pathway are supplied when the names of the enzymes
and star symbols in the output table and ﬁgure are clicked.
When the metabolic pathway traverses more than one
KEGG map, it can be connected from several KEGG
maps using our system, as presented in Figure S5 (See
Supplementary Data).
Case studies
Case study I—application in plant secondary metabolites
production. Plant-speciﬁc ﬂavonoids are important sec-
ondary metabolites which are synthesized from
4-coumaroyl coenzyme A (CoA) and derived from the
general phenylpropanoid pathway, and three malonyl-
CoAs. Numerous plant ﬂavonoid biosynthetic enzymes,
which are individually expressed in E. coli as functional
enzymes, have been identiﬁed (26,27). Furthermore, Watts
et al. (28) successfully cloned several critical genes from
plants into E. coli and observed the high-level production
of ﬂavanone naringenin by feeding exogenous
4-coumarate. In this work, the system of Watts et al.’s
was adopted as an example to demonstrate the eﬀective-
ness of FMM. When either the genes that can be cloned
into E. coli to produce naringenin from 4-coumarate,
W132 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37,Web Server issue
or the species from which they can be cloned, are
unknown, FMM identiﬁes them most easily.
4-Coumarate (C00811) and naringenin (C00509) were
inputted into FMM; one E. coli was selected from
‘major species’ and ‘Arabidopsis thaliana’ and ‘Oryza
sativa’ were selected from ‘comparative species’ in the
‘Comparative Analysis’ web page. Figure S6 (See
Supplementary Data) indicates the eﬀortlessness of under-
standing how the metabolic pathway from 4-coumarate to
naringenin passes through three enzymes (4-coumarate-
CoA ligase, chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase),
none of which are present in E. coli. Nevertheless, the
results of FMM reveal that all of these genes can be
cloned from A. thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus tricho-
carpa, Glycine max and Vitis vinifera. Watts et al. (28)
cloned 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, chalcone synthase, and
chalcone isomerase genes from Arabidopsis into E. coli;
the results herein provide information that supports this
cloning. FMM is thus a very useful tool in microbial engi-
neering in synthetic biology.
Case study II—application in pharmaceuticals. Plants
are well known to generate large amounts of
phenylpropanoids which are important sources of phar-
maceuticals due to their diverse chemical structures; for
example, resveratrol is a chemopreventive anti-cancer
agent (29). The inhibition of inﬂammation, tumor promo-
tion, angiogenesis and metastasis and regulation of cell
cycle progression are all pharmaceutical beneﬁts of resver-
atrol (30). However, the mass-production of resveratrol is
expensive because of the extraction processes are costly.
However, the superb health eﬀects of resveratrol are moti-
vating scientists to synthesize resveratrol using metabolic
engineering methods in bacteria. When synthetic engineer-
ing in bacteria, genes from which organisms are cloned
into bacteria should be identiﬁed. FMM is an eﬀective
tool for this purpose. For instance, if E. coli is to be
used to produce resveratrol, resveratrol and tyrosine
(which is a well known amino acid for the production of
plant secondary metabolites) can be input into FMM. The
synthesis pathway of resveratrol from tyrosine is easily
determined (Figure 3A). Figure 3A reveals that E. coli
and yeast cannot synthesize resveratrol unless several crit-
ical genes are cloned into their cells from other species.
For example, tyrosine-ammonia-lyase can be obtained
from R. sphaeroides, 4-coumarate-CoA-lagase can be
obtained from V. vinifera or A. thaliana, and trihydroxys-
tilbene synthase can be obtained from A. hypogaea or
V. vinifera. The results can be used as candidates for fur-
ther experimental conﬁrmation. Accordingly, FMM has
practical and eﬀective functions in synthetic biology.
Certainly, FMM is also useful in the reconstruction of
synthesis (metabolic) pathways. The metabolic pathways
of interest can be signiﬁcantly identiﬁed in KEGG maps in
FMM. Furthermore, FMM is particularly convenient
when the metabolic pathway traverses more than one
KEGG map. Figure S5 (See Supplementary Materials)
indicates that the metabolic pathway from D-erythrose-4-
-phosphate to chorismate passes through three KEGG
maps. No other server has presented such a convenient
interface for identifying metabolic pathway.
SUMMARY
The concept of FMM is illustrated in Figure 1, which
demonstrates that metabolic pathways can be easily recon-
structed among various species using the FMM system.
The results suggest that FMM is helpful in metabolic engi-
neering by reconstructing metabolic pathways for produ-
cing some valuable metabolites or secondary metabolites
in bacteria or yeast, which approach has potential in drug
production. Moreover, FMM can be used to compare
the metabolic pathways between numerous species and
connect metabolic pathways of diﬀerent KEGG maps,
suggesting that FMM is not only an eﬀective tool for syn-
thetic biology, such as in the production of drugs and
biofuels, but also a useful resource for investigation in
metabolism.
In order to connect metabolic pathways of diﬀerent
KEGG maps in FMM, the compounds and reactions are
restricted by the KEGG database. However, people may
argue the incompleteness of FMM database for extract-
ing metabolic pathway, due to several shortcomings of
Figure 3. An example of web interface in FMM. (A) ‘Vertical graph’
and (B) ‘Global graph’ (KEGG map) of the metabolic pathway from

KEGG database, such as incomplete compounds and
reactions (31,32). During the prospective works, we will
integrate other resources, such as MetaCyc (16) to
enhance the information of biochemical reactions in
FMM database.
