[1] Climatic influences on snow accumulation across the Tibetan Plateau are examined
using records of net snow accumulation (An) and oxygen isotopic ratios (d
18O) since 1801
from two ice cores from opposite sides of the Plateau. From 1880 to the 1990s, summer
monsoon precipitation has been a significant component of the annual accumulation
on the Dasuopu glacier in the Himalayas, but during the latter part of the Little Ice Age
(1810 to 1880) total An was 30% higher than the summer monsoon amounts in
northern India. This was possibly the result of increased early winter snowfall as westerly
low-pressure systems linked to the North Atlantic pushed farther east along the Himalayas
than they normally do today. The decades of high accumulation and the colder
temperatures allowed excess snow and ice to persist late into each year, which may have
weakened the subsequent Asian summer monsoon. Consequently, precipitation in the
northeast Tibetan Plateau where the Dunde ice cap is located may have been affected
primarily by Eurasian continental processes rather than tropical meteorology during this
time. Since the onset of the recent warming over the last century, the south Asian summer
monsoon intensified and influenced summer climate farther to the north and west, and
expressions of tropical Pacific and Indian Oceanic/atmospheric processes are noticeable in
the Dunde net accumulation record. The Dunde and Dasuopu glaciers, which are located
on the northern and southern rims of the Tibetan Plateau, were situated in regions of
environmental transition as the Northern Hemisphere climate shifted from a neoglacial to a
warming climate mode, which is something to consider when interpreting the longer ice
core climate records.

1. Introduction
[2] The health of the Asian monsoon directly affects
60% of the Earth’s population via the availability of water
resources for agriculture and industry. Anomalous behavior
exhibited by this ocean/atmosphere/land-linked circulation
results in hardships from flooding or drought. The essential
driver of the monsoon circulation is the thermally induced
pressure gradient between land and ocean, and any decrease/
increase in that gradient can lead to lower/higher than normal
precipitation during a climatically, sociologically and eco-
nomically critical time of year for Asian populations. Early
observational studies of the forcing mechanisms of the
monsoons [Blanford, 1884; Walker, 1910] laid the founda-
tion for later work by Hahn and Shukla [1976], Dickson
[1984], Rao et al. [1996], Kripalani et al. [1996], and Wu
and Qian [2003], among others. These, along with model
experiments [e.g., Vernekar et al., 1995; Bamzai and Marx,
2000], have linked late winter/early spring snow cover
and/or depth over various regions of Eurasia inversely
with the strength of the subsequent summer monsoon.
Large quantities of winter snow that persist into the spring
tend to increase the terrestrial albedo and prevent the
sensible heating necessary to help drive the monsoon
circulation. Most of the observations of Eurasian snow
depth and cover are derived from satellite measurements,
and thus only extend back to the middle 1960s.
[3] The interaction between tropical ocean processes and
the Asian monsoon has recently received much attention,
especially through the study of coral records [Charles et al.,
1997; Cole et al., 2000]. The El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation
has been linked to monsoon intensity via the zonal Walker
circulation [Walker, 1910; Rasmusson and Carpenter,

1983], while sea surface temperature and atmospheric
dipoles in the Indian Ocean are linked to Pacific Ocean
processes on decadal and shorter timescales [Charles et al.,
2003]. The ocean basin interactions, and the possible feed-
backs between oscillations in land temperatures and SSTs
all affect the spatial extent and intensity of the Asian
monsoon on interannual to decadal periods.
[4] The presence (or lack thereof) of the connections
between all these components of the overall monsoon
circulation can be investigated qualitatively further back
in time using paleoclimate proxy records of land temper-
atures, sea surface temperatures (SST), and precipitation. To
this end, two centuries of annually resolved ice core data
from the northeastern and southern margins of the Tibetan
Plateau, along with SST proxy records from western Pacific
and western Indian Ocean corals, are analyzed for evidence
of monsoon expression and forcing. Paleoclimate records
that can demonstrate past climatic relationships between the
Asian continent and the tropical oceans and their effects on
precipitation, especially prior to the recent acceleration in
warming, can greatly aid in reconstructing the long-term
history of the summer monsoon and its forcings over the
Tibetan Plateau where instrumental records are scarce and
of short duration.
2. Data
2.1. Tibetan Plateau Ice Core Records
[5] The Dunde ice cap (38N 96E, 5325 meters above
sea level, or m asl), located in the Qilian Shan along the
northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, was drilled in the
summer of 1987 as part of a cooperative program between
the Ohio State University’s Byrd Polar Research Center
(OSU-BPRC) and the Chinese Academy of Science’s
(CAS) Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology,
or LIGG (since absorbed into the Key Laboratory of Ice
Core and Cold Regions Environment, or CAREERI). Three
cores were drilled to bedrock; core 1 (DnC1, 140 m) was
divided between the two institutes, cut into samples, melted
and bottled in the field, core 2 (DnC2, 136 m) was taken by
LIGG, and OSU-BPRC took possession of core 3 (DnC3,
138 m). The top 55 m of DnC3 was cut into samples,
melted, and bottled in the field in keeping with the CAS
policy at the time governing sample removal from China,
while the lower 83 m of the core was returned frozen to
OSU-BPRC. DnC1 was analyzed for d18O, or the ratios of
oxygen-18 (18O) to oxygen-16 (16O), and total dust con-
centration throughout its length, while DnC3 was analyzed
for these parameters plus anion chemistry [Thompson et al.,
1989, 1990].
[6] The timescales for the upper sections of DnC1 and
DnC3 were constructed using visible dust stratigraphy and
verified with seasonal variations in dust and d18O
(Figures 1a and 1b). Each annual layer is bounded by dust
layers which are deposited on the glacier during the late
winter/early spring as westerly low-pressure systems carry
dust from the northwestern China deserts. High aerosol
concentrations are generally associated with more negative
d18O values (marked with asterisks); thus the annual layers
roughly correspond to calendar years (winter to winter). A
beta radioactivity signal, which is a product of the massive
Soviet Arctic thermonuclear tests of 1962/1963, appears in
the core with the 1963 dust peak, providing a dating
calibration. At the top of an ice core where stratigraphic
layers are thicker, it is possible to sample continuously at
subannual resolution. During the late twentieth century the
average net accumulation (An) on the Dunde ice cap was
44 cm water equivalent (w.e.) [Thompson et al., 1989,
1990]. In DnC1, each year since 1801 contains from three to
fourteen samples, depending on the layer thickness and
sample size. With depth vertical flow causes annual layer
thinning, so although the average sample size decreases
down-core, eventually so does the number of samples per
year until at some point subannual sampling becomes
impossible. The annually resolved timescales for DnC1
and DnC3 extend back to 1600 A.D. at 88 and 85 meters
depth, respectively.
[7] This study presents only the d18O time series from
DnC1 (Figure 1b), the data from which were produced at
the Isotope Laboratory of the Geophysical Institute at the
University of Copenhagan. Unfortunately, because of the
delay in the purchase and installation of a Finnigan Mat
Delta E mass spectrometer at OSU-BPRC, the analysis of
the d18O for DnC3 began almost two years after drilling.
Meanwhile, the limited amount of bottled material from
the upper part of the ice core was sampled for other
parameters (such as dust, anion chemistry, beta radioac-
tivity), and water was distributed among researchers out-
side OSU for their own work. As a result, the d18O data
set for DnC3 contains numerous gaps, in fact almost 10%
of the d18O data is missing from the upper 55 meters of
the core which corresponds to the period between 1808
and 1987.
[8] In 1997, another cooperative program between LIGG
and OSU-BPRC culminated in the drilling of the Dasuopu
glacier on the north slope of the central Himalayas (28N,
85E, 7200 m asl) [Thompson et al., 2000a]. Three ice cores
were recovered, the first of which was drilled down-flow
from the ice divide but did not reach bedrock. The time
series extends back only to 1922 A.D. at 160 m, and below
74 m depth (corresponding to 1945 A.D.) the stratigraphy is
severely compromised by ice flow. Cores 2 and 3 (DsC2
and DsC3) were drilled close to the ice divide, and both
reached bedrock at 149 m and 168 m, respectively. DsC2
was taken frozen to LIGG, and DsC3 was returned com-
pletely frozen and intact to OSU-BPRC. Thus it was
possible to sample all of DsC3 in great detail in a controlled
environment, which was an advantage over the Dunde
analysis. Both DsC2 and DsC3 were analyzed for d18O in
their respective laboratories, but dust concentrations were
measured only for DsC3. From the seasonal oscillations of
isotopes and dust (as illustrated in Figure 1c for DsC3) time
series of annual d18O variations were produced (Figure 1d).
In this ice core, the cold season dust peaks are nearly
juxtaposed with the enriched isotopic values. As with the
DnC1 record, the beta radioactivity peak of 1963 helped in
calibrating the timescale. The cores were annually dated
back to 1440 A.D. at 144 meters, with an uncertainty of
3 years [Thompson et al., 2000a].
[9] Annual net accumulation (An) records were con-
structed for both the Dunde and Dasuopu ice cores using
a two-parameter steady state flow model that takes into
account the rapid thinning of layers near a glacier’s flow
divide [Bolzan, 1985; Reeh, 1988; Thompson et al., 1989,

1990, 2000a]. The reconstructed thickness of each annual
layer is determined by the relationship
L zð Þ ¼ b 1 z=Hð Þpþ1; ð1Þ
where H is the ice thickness, b is the average accumulation
rate in meters per year (m yr1), and z is the ice equivalent
depth. In a steady state situation, where b is assumed to be
constant, the exponent p is uniquely solvable from the
depths (z1 and z2) of two well-dated horizons at times T1
and T2:
T2 1 z1=Hð Þp1½  ¼ T1 1 z2=Hð Þp1½ : ð2Þ
For both the Dunde and Dasuopu reconstructions, the upper
reference horizon (T1) was the 1963 A.D. peak in beta
activity. The lower time horizon in the Dunde record was
4550 years before 1987 at a depth of 117 m, which was the

tests is also noted. (c) and (d) Same as Figures 1a and 1b for Dasuopu core 3 (heavy line); however, the

limit of the resolution of the annual dust layers in the visible
stratigraphy [Thompson et al., 1990], and for Dasuopu it
was 1440 A.D., or 557 years before 1997 (at 144 m). The
resulting An records for the Dunde and Dasuopu ice cores
are shown in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively.
2.2. Tropical Coral Records
[10] The d18O records from corals have long been recog-
nized as acceptable proxy indicators of sea surface temper-
ature [Fairbanks and Dodge, 1979]. The relationship
between temperature and d18O in corals can be complicated
by vital effects and seasonal rainfall variations that might
change the isotopic composition of the ocean surface mixed
layer [Cole and Fairbanks, 1990; Linsley et al., 1994].
Corals that best record SSTs are located in regions where
temperature is the major variable. Here, two continuous
coral records from the west end of the equatorial Indian
Ocean and the western tropical Pacific are used to display
SST variations in regions that are important for Asian
summer monsoon circulation and other processes with
which it interacts. The coral record from the Malindi Marine
Park (3S, 40E) off the coast of Kenya [Cole et al., 2000]
covers the period from 1801 to 1994, and the record from
Papua New Guinea (6S, 148E) [Tudhope et al., 2001]
extends from 1881 to 1993. Both time series are available
on the World Data Center for Paleoclimatology/NOAA
Paleoclimatology Program web site.
2.3. Reanalysis and Gridded Temperature Data
[11] Time series (1949 to 2003) of surface temperatures
from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set [Kalnay et al.,
1996] were obtained from the International Research Insti-
tute for Climate Prediction Climate Data Library (http://
iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/). The area of interest covers 30E
to 110E, 60N to 0, which encompasses most of Asia
from Siberia to the northern Indian Ocean. In addition,
longer land temperature records from central Asia were
obtained from the NOAA NCDC monthly gridded temper-
ature anomalies derived from the Global Historical Climate
Network, or GHCN [Baker et al., 1995], which can be
downloaded from http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/
.NOAA/.NCDC/.GCPS/.MONTHLY/.GRIDDED/.
3. Concerning the Use of D18O in Ice as a
Temperature Proxy
[12] Annual values of d18O in precipitation show linear
relationships with mean annual temperatures at middle and
high latitudes [Craig, 1961; Dansgaard, 1964; Jouzel et al.,
1997]; however, the degree to which d18O reflects temper-
ature in tropical precipitation is more controversial. Analy-
ses of samples collected from low-latitude regions which
experience distinctly different seasonal hydrology demon-
strate that there are often inverse correlations between
summer d18O and the amount of precipitation (the ‘‘amount
effect’’). Rozanski et al. [1993] noted that the amount effect
has a dominant influence on the depletion of 18O in
monsoon precipitation in New Delhi and Hong Kong,
located within the Indian and Southeast Asian monsoon
regimes, respectively. This relationship is characteristic of
tropical precipitation and is documented in ice core records
from the Peruvian Andes [Thompson et al., 1986, 1995;
Grootes et al., 1989].
[13] An alternative explanation for the lower isotopic
values is that a significant portion of the summer precipitation
comes from deep convective activity in which fractionation
of water vapor occurs during ascent of air parcels within the
cold, vertically extensive clouds. In the tropics, the change in
mean condensation level (MCL) between wet and dry
seasons may result in temperature and humidity conditions
that are highly variable. In tropical regions where precipita-
tion results from deep convection during the summer, water
vapor condenses at much higher elevations and thus at colder
temperatures than during the winter. Thompson et al. [2000b]
determined the average MCL changes in the atmosphere
throughout the year to construct a monthly temperature-
isotope relationship in the tropical Huascara´n ice core from
the Peruvian Andes (9S, 70W).
[14] There are several striking differences between the
Dunde and Dasuopu dust and d18O data, both in seasonal
Figure 2. Time series in annual averages for (a) Dunde core 1 net accumulation (An) and core 3 An;
(b) Dasuopu core 2 An and core 3 An.

timing and in signal-to-noise quality. Because the accumu-
lation rate on Dasuopu is about 2.5 times that on Dunde
(currently 100 cm w.e. versus 44 cm w.e., respectively), the
wet summer to dry winter amplitudes are much greater and
the oscillations vary more smoothly. The monsoon-type
seasonal isotopic distribution described above occurs in
the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau where Dasuopu
is located [Thompson et al., 2000a; Dahe et al., 2000; Davis
and Thompson, 2004], with more negative d18O (18O
depleted) values occurring in the cleaner summer snowfall
(Figure 1c). There is a very large vertical relief between the
central Himalayas and the plains of Nepal to the south over
a short distance, so as the moisture rises, adiabatic cooling
and condensation of the water vapor contributes to the
isotopic fractionation. Much of the summer snow is derived
from the deep monsoon convection at very high-altitude
condensation levels, a situation somewhat like that for the
Huascara´n ice cap described by Thompson et al. [2000b].
The winter precipitation, which today comprises a small
percentage of the annual total, comes from disturbances that
occasionally move eastward from the Hindu Kush-western
Himalayan mountain complex [Rao, 2003]. The precipita-
tion ultimately originates in the high latitudes, and is
delivered to the Himalayas by frontal systems rather than
by deep convection. Thus the MCL occurs at a lower
elevation in the winter, resulting in less fractionation and
more enriched d18O values.
[15] As the annual layers thin with depth in an ice core,
the amplitudes of the seasonal cycles of d18O also decrease.
This is due partially to diffusion of the isotopes in situ;
however, the decreasing ratio of the number of samples to
annual layer thickness down-core is also a critical factor.
Normal layer thinning rates in small tropical ice caps
accelerate with depth relatively close to the surface; for
example, in DsC3 this rapid thinning begins around 60 m,
which corresponds to 1940 A.D. As the sample resolution per
year decreases, the amplitudes of the seasonal d18O variations
decrease, and the winter and summer values event-
ually converge towards the annual averages (Figure 3).
The regressions between each detrended seasonal and the
detrended annual time series are comparable, as shown in
Figures 3b and 3c (0.42 for summer versus annual and 0.36
for winter versus annual). Therefore it is assumed here that
the record of annual d18O represents the regional temperature
variations, which correlates significantly (R = +0.48, signif-
icance at the 1% level, 3-year running means) with the
Northern Hemisphere June to August (JJA) temperature
record of Jones et al. [1998]. Thus, whether or not the
amount effect plays an intraseasonal role in the isotopic
composition of the monsoon-derived snow in the Himalayas,
on longer timescales temperatures appear to be more influ-
ential [Thompson, 2000; Thompson et al., 2000b].
[16] North of the Tanggula Mountains (33N), the most
enriched (least negative) d18O values occur in summer
snowfall [Aragua´s-Aragua´s et al., 1998; Tian et al.,
2001], which is also observed in the Dunde ice core
stratigraphy (Figure 1a). Located at 38N, Dunde is more
a temperate than a tropical glacier, and its seasonal isotopic
variations more resemble those from polar rather than
tropical ice cores. The northeast part of the Plateau, which

lies on the edge of the Asian monsoon regime, receives
summer moisture not only from the south but also from
mid-latitude westerlies and from the north [Yatagai and
Yasunari, 1995]. In the past the Asian monsoon boundary
has shifted in response to warming [Liu et al., 1998]; for
example, during the mid-Holocene ‘‘climatic optimum’’ its
influence may have extended well to the north beyond its
present limits. Any monsoon-derived moisture that the
Qilian Shan receives has been recycled over thousands of
kilometers over land. Since the winter and summer precip-
itation form at equivalent MCLs, it is most likely that
surface temperature has the strongest control over the
isotopic fractionation.
[17] There are several lines of evidence supporting the
link between d18O values in precipitation and temperature in
the northern part of the Tibetan Plateau. Significant relation-
ships exist between monthly averages of d18O measured in
precipitation collected at Delingha (150 km from Dunde)
and air temperature [Yao et al., 1996]. On decadal time-
scales, d18O in a core from the Malan ice cap (36N, 90E),
which is also located close to Dunde, has demonstrated
significant correlations with 500 hPa temperatures at sta-
tions across the northern Plateau over a 30-year period in the
late twentieth century [Wang et al., 2003]. In order to show
the spatial patterns of the correlations between Eurasian
surface temperature and the recent part of the Dunde oxygen
isotope record, the annual averages of d18O from 1949 to
1986, smoothed with three-year running means (3 yrm), are
correlated with unsmoothed mean June–July–August (JJA)
surface temperatures from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data
set [Kalnay et al., 1996] over Asia (Figure 4a). The contours
outlining regions of significant correlation coefficients (R)
are shown, and those that are significant at the 99% level
(R > +0.5, N = 37) are shaded. These areas extend
throughout Asia north of 40, and are even located close
to Dunde, but the region of highest correlation (R > +0.6) is
in the Kirgiz Steppe to the northeast of the Caspian Sea.
[18] The reanalysis data only extends back to 1949, but
the gridded temperature anomalies that are derived from the
GHCN provide continuous reconstructed records based on
Figure 4. (a) Regions of significant correlation between the Dunde d18O record and NCEP/NCAR
reanalysis surface temperatures from 1949 to 1986 [Kalnay et al., 1996]. The Dunde time series is treated
with three-year running means. Shaded areas indicate correlation coefficients significant at the 99% level.
The locations of the Dunde and Dasuopu glaciers are noted. (b) Comparison of the Dunde d18O z-scores

instrumental measurements back to the end of the nine-
teenth century in a few places in Asia. Fortunately, two
of those grid points lie in the region of highest surface
temperature and d18O correlation, at 50 to 55N and 55
to 60E. Figure 4b illustrates that the average June to
August (JJA) temperature anomalies for these coordinates
and the annual averages of the Dunde d18O show similar
trends over decadal timescales.
4. Dasuopu An Record Since the Little Ice Age
[19] Recent studies indicate that the glaciers in the central
Himalayas currently receive most of their annual snowfall
(up to 70%) during the summer monsoon season from
the Arabian Sea via north central and northeast India
[Thompson et al., 2000a; He et al., 2003]. In fact, the
Dasuopu An record (DsC2 and DsC3 combined) from
1880 to 1995 broadly resembles the reconstructed sum-
mer monsoon rainfall record from north central India (NCI)
[Sontakke and Singh, 1996], with accumulation in both
averaging about 100 cm yr1 of water during this period
(Figure 5). Since 1950, the two records have diverged slightly
as Dasuopu An has slowly decreased, possibly due to recent
glacier wastage that is affecting much of the Himalayas and
the Tibetan Plateau [Kadota et al., 1997; Dahe et al., 2000;
Su and Shi, 2002; Liu et al., 2003]. During the latter part of
the Little Ice Age (LIA) before 1880, the Dasuopu An
averaged 30% higher than the NCI rainfall, and in fact
higher than any of the regional or all India summer monsoon
indices compiled by Sontakke and Singh [1996]. The excess
snow during this latter part of the LIA may have been the
result of either higher summer precipitation that somehow
was not experienced in the monsoon regions to the south, or
by higher accumulation rates during the winter.
[20] The winter westerly storms that originate as cutoff
lows near the Caspian Sea [Rao, 2003] currently deliver
most of the annual snowfall to the western Himalayas.
These ‘‘western disturbances’’ travel through the intersec-
tion, or ‘‘notch’’ between the western Himalayas and the
Hindu Kush Mountains, boxed by the coordinates 30 to
32.5N, 70 to 75E [Lang and Barros, 2004]. The dis-
turbances are low-pressure systems, characterized by the
lowering of the 500 hPa geopotential height (GPH) in the
region, that contribute to orographically forced snowfall
further to the east in the central Himalayas. A weak but
significant correlation between the low-pressure systems
and the Polar/Eurasian teleconnection suggests that the
atmospheric conditions in the circumpolar region play a
role in the intensity and frequency of the winter storm
activity in these mountains.
[21] Significant correlations between the summer North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the concentration of sodium
chloride in a shallow Dasuopu ice core suggest a direct or
indirect teleconnection between atmospheric processes in
the North Atlantic and the meteorology in the Asian
monsoon regime, including the Himalayas [Wang et al.,
2002]. Following this hypothesis, it may be reasonable to
infer such a connection, indirect as it may be, between the
North Atlantic and the central Himalayas via the western
Himalayan ‘‘notch’’ in the winter, when the effects of the
NAO are more significant across Eurasia. Phillips et al.
[2000] in fact noted a sensitivity of Himalayan glaciation to
North Atlantic circulation changes on millennial or shorter
timescales. Just as there is a weak but significant relation-
ship between the notch GPH and the Polar/Eurasian tele-
connection [Lang and Barros, 2004], there is a similar
correlation (when both time series are smoothed with three-
year running means) between the former and the NAO
index (NAOI) during the late autumn and winter months
(November to March) from 1949 to 2003 (Figure 6a).
[22] After comparing the extended NAOI time series
[Jones et al., 1997] during various combinations of winter
months with the Dasuopu An, the closest match was found
unexpectedly using the November and December combined
indices, but not with indices later in the winter (Figure 6b).
However, the similarities exist only before the early 1880s,
when the records show a significant correlation (R = 0.32,
95% significance level). Around 1880, as the LIA ended
and the Northern Hemisphere temperatures warmed, the
Icelandic Low strengthened and within 10 years the NAOI
shifted from a strong negative to a positive mode, contem-
poraneously with a sharp drop in the An.
[23] On visual inspection of the Dasuopu An and NAO
records, it is obvious that strong oscillations are present that
change in frequency and amplitude between the LIA and the
post-LIA periods. Spectral analysis using the Blackman-
Tukey method (with a Bartlett window) was performed on
these subseries. Prior to 1880, the spectral curves of the
November–December NAOI and Dasuopu An are quite
similar, with both series showing significant signals at
Figure 5. Comparison between the Dasuopu An record since 1801 and the north central India (NCI)

15.5 to 17.3 years, 3.6 to 3.8 years and 2.9 years (Figure 6c).
After the drop in accumulation and the increase in the NAOI
at the end of the LIA, the power spectra diverge (Figure 6d).
The Dasuopu An, which at this point reflects summer
monsoonprecipitation,maintains its quasi-decadal frequency,
but also acquires a 27-year cycle that may be suggestive of
Pacific Basin processes such as the Pacific Decadal Oscil-
lation (PDO). The only real agreement during the post-LIA
period is at 5.8 to 6.1 years, which suggests an ENSO signal.
This lends support to the previous discussion that North
Atlantic processes were influential over the early winter
precipitation during the LIA, and later were replaced by
tropical Pacific influences as the recent warming got under-
way and the monsoon circulation asserted more control over
the annual Dasuopu accumulation.
[24] It is paradoxical that meteorological conditions in the
late autumn and early winter would dominate the Himala-
yan snowfall in the later part of the LIA, since today the
majority of the winter storms appear from January to March.
However, the climatic conditions in the central Himalayas,
and indeed over the Northern Hemisphere, during the
nineteenth century were much colder than they have been
since (Figure 6e). Limited documentation exists concerning
the later onset of winter in Asia since the end of the LIA
[Shimaraev et al., 2002].
[25] It is unlikely that even large and persistent changes
in the North Atlantic circulation during the late autumn-
early winter would have been the sole cause of such
large increases in winter snow in the central Himalayas.

temperatures and the unusual upper level pressure patterns,
may have been more frequent and intense. Also, more
winter snow may have persisted into the summer half of
the year than it has since the post-LIA warming began.
Regardless of the extent of North Atlantic involvement in
the climate of the Himalayas (and the rest of the monsoon
regime), evidence does exist that a unique set of atmospheric
conditions existed during most of the nineteenth century that
occurred along with unusually heavy winter snow accumu-
lation in this region.
5. Controls on Snow Accumulation on the Dunde
Ice Cap in the NE Tibetan Plateau
[26] Currently an important, but not the only, precipita-
tion source for the northeast Plateau in the summer is
recycled moisture from the southeast Asian monsoon
through the extensive Tibetan lake system. Because of the
east-west orientation of the mountain ranges, monsoon
precipitation can penetrate into eastern Tibet [Sobel et al.,
2001], but the steeply declining gradient of the moisture
over distance insures that the amount that reaches the Dunde
ice cap is small as reflected by the average annual accumu-
lation rate (44 cm w.e.), some of which is deposited in the
winter. The Dunde and Dasuopu An profiles are nearly
mirror images of each other [Davis and Thompson, 2004].
When Dasuopu An was high during the nineteenth century,
Dunde was low and their trends reversed through the recent
warming. Does this suggest that the climatic processes
affecting these two glaciers are linked?
5.1. Dunde An and Asian Land Temperatures
Since the Little Ice Age
[27] Since a significant portion of Dunde’s annual pre-
cipitation is monsoon-derived, its net accumulation record
should show connections with the end members of the
gradient between Asian land temperatures and tropical
ocean SSTs. For the land temperature side of this relation-
ship the Dunde d18O time series is useful, especially since
the An and d
18O chronologies are derived from the same ice
core and therefore dating uncertainties that occur between
independently constructed chronologies can be avoided. In
Figure 7a, the records are smoothed with three-year running
means to mask the high frequency noise. Simple visual
inspection of the curves indicate that the relationships
during the LIA are opposite (low/high temperatures, high/
low accumulation) and continue thus until the early twen-
tieth century. From 1800 to 1860 there is a strong and
regular oscillation in both the parameters, although the
period of the isotope oscillation is greater than that of the
accumulation (13 versus 8.5 years, respectively, Figure 7b).
Around 1900 to 1910, 20 to 30 years after the Northern
Figure 7. (a) Comparison of the Dunde ice core An (heavy line) and d
18O (light line) records, both
smoothed with three-year running means. Power spectra for the Dunde parameters are shown for the
period (b) from 1801 to 1883 and (c) from 1884 to 1986. Significant frequency bands (over the
95% confidence levels) are noted. The bandwidth in the analysis was 0.047.

Hemisphere warming began and the Himalayan accumula-
tion abruptly decreased, high An was more often than not
contemporaneous with high Asian surface temperatures, and
the spectral frequencies of the two records show some
agreement (Figure 7b). Both have a strong 42-year cycle,
a quasi-decadal signal, and an ENSO-type signal at 5.3 to
5.5 years. The changing relationships between the isotope-
derived temperatures and the reconstructed monsoon pre-
cipitation in this region suggest that the climate in the
northeastern Tibetan Plateau underwent a mode shift
between the LIA and the recent warming.
5.2. Dunde An and Tropical Sea Surface Temperature
Records From Corals
[28] There are many high-resolution records of SST
variations available from the equatorial Indian and Pacific
Oceans, and those from living corals are among the most
useful. One drawback for coral records, like those from ice
cores, is the limited spatial coverage which is governed by
site suitability and logistical considerations. A region of
interest where records are available is Papua New Guinea,
which is located close to the interaction between the
southeast Asian monsoon and Pacific Basin processes such
as El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Unfortunately the
longest continuous published record from this site (DT91-7)
only extends back to 1880 [Tudhope et al., 2001], and thus
does not cover the LIA.
[29] If the New Guinea isotopic data reflect SST at the
western end of the ENSO dipole and if the source for
the Dunde summer precipitation is the Asian monsoon, then
the coral and ice core records should show a relationship
that reflects the connection between these ocean-atmosphere
linked processes. From 1880 (the beginning of the coral
record) to 1920, the correlation is insignificant (Figure 8a).
Figure 8. Comparison of Dunde An record (heavy line) with (a) a coral d
18O record from Papua New
Guinea, (b) the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) from June to August, and (c) the Malindi coral d18O
record from the western Indian Ocean. All time series are smoothed with three-year running means.
(d) Comparison of filtered Malindi d18O and Dunde An series, both smoothed with a 7.7- to 14.3-year
Gaussian band-pass-filter (bandwidth equal to 0.03).
D04101 DAVIS ET AL.: RECENT ASIAN MONSOON VARIABILITY

D04101
However, within the period since the end of the LIA that
covers the recent warming, the correlations show some
significance (depleted d18O with high An) from 1920 to
1986 (0.39 at 95% significance level). Cooler than normal
SST’s at the western end of the ENSO dipole are charac-
teristic of El Nin˜o conditions, during which Asian mon-
soons have shown decreased strength. In order to confirm
the degree to which the ice core record reflects ENSO
variability, a comparison with the June through August
(JJA) Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is illustrated in
Figure 8b. Since the middle 1890s, the correlation between
Dunde An and SOI has been significantly positive (+0.50,
99% significance level) and all three records show a strong
6.6-year signal which is visually obvious, but the relation-
ship was reversed before 1895 (0.42, 95% significance
level). Unfortunately as with the coral, the SOI record does
not extend back early enough to observe the Pacific Basin
conditions during the coldest part of the LIA.
[30] One of the few corals that provide a continuous
isotopic record since the beginning of the nineteenth century
is from the Malindi Marine Park in the western equatorial
Indian Ocean. Visual inspection of the comparison between
Malindi d18O and Dunde An (Figure 8c) shows a strong
positive correlation (1881 to 1986, R = 0.49, significance at
99%), i.e., enriched/depleted isotopes (cold/warm SST) are
coincident with high/low accumulation. Before 1880, the
correlation is nonexistent. Cole et al. [2000] noticed a
strong decadal signal in this coral from which they con-
cluded that climatic variability in the western Indian Ocean
is heavily influenced by the tropical Pacific. Similarly, a
9.8-year signal is observed in the Dunde accumulation
record from 1881 to 1986 (Figure 7c). In order to isolate
these decadal signals, both time series were smoothed with
a 7.7 to 14.3-year band-pass-filter (Figure 8d). Alignment
between the coral and the ice core is obvious from 1920 to
the early 1980s, which to be expected if the Dunde
accumulation is reflecting Pacific oscillations during the
twentieth century warming. In fact, in Figure 8a the coral
record from New Guinea and Dunde An begin to show
greater correlation around 1920. Therefore, during the
recent warming trend, after the seemingly pivotal period
in the late 1880s, the Dunde accumulation time series seems
to reflect the interlinked Pacific-Indian Ocean processes that
are documented in the coral records [Cole et al., 2000],
along with the Indian Ocean Dipole [Saji et al., 1999],
which is thought to influence the Asian monsoon [Charles
et al., 2003].
[31] Figure 8d also shows two short periods of alignment
in the nineteenth century, from the mid-1820s to 1850, and
from 1870 to 1890. It may only be coincidental, but during
these two intervals the Dunde d18O are enriched (Figure 7a),
which may indicate some degree of warming in the central
Asia. Accumulation actually shows sharp increases in the
middle of each of these intervals, but whether that is due to
increased precipitation from the south is impossible to
determine from these records.
6. Discussion
[32] Observational and model studies have presented
evidence for a cause and effect mechanism between the
extent and/or depth of late winter-early spring snow cover
over various parts of Eurasia and the strength of the
subsequent summer monsoon. Large amounts of energy
are required to melt a larger spring snow pack, inhibiting
the sensible heating of the high Asian region and the
development of the thermal low pressure that is important
for establishing the summer monsoon circulation. The
Himalayas are thought by some to be an especially
critical region in this mechanism [Dong and Valdes,
1998; Kripalani et al., 2003].
[33] Linkages between the North Atlantic and winter
storms in the Himalayas during the Little Ice Age prior to
the end of the nineteenth century were discussed above. The
persistence of the snow late into the year over several
decades in the southern Tibetan Plateau may have been a
causal mechanism for a weaker monsoon circulation. The
extended all-India summer rainfall (AISR) record from
1813 (not shown) indicates that the middle of the nineteenth
century was overall the driest in India [Sontakke and Singh,
1996] at the same time that the Dasuopu accumulation was
at its highest. In fact, the Dasuopu data and the AISR record
show opposite trends up until the middle 1880s, then switch
into a positive relationship until the early 1960s. This
supports the findings of Robock et al. [2003], who noted
a changing correlation between the all-India rainfall record
(as representing the strength of the Asian summer monsoon)
and Eurasian snow cover (using the NAO as a proxy) such
that the two were only significantly correlated in the 1880s
and the late twentieth century, but these comparisons only
extend back to 1871. During these two periods, lower NAO
indices were coincident with low all-India rainfall (AIR),
and it was also during these periods that interannual
variability in the winter Eurasian circulation and the sum-
mer monsoon was highest. This presented a challenge to
Blanford [1884], which promoted snow cover over the
Himalayas as a consistent predictor of subsequent summer
Indian monsoon strength. However, in the case of the
Dasuopu record, it is proposed here that winter precipitation
in the Himalayas was much higher up until 1880 and
added to the summer snowfall to result in a 30% increase in
annual accumulation, and that cold temperatures allowed
this deep snow to persist into the warm season, thus
inhibiting the development of the subsequent summer
monsoon. After the LIA ended, the winter snow totals in
the central Himalayas abruptly dropped, the land and ocean
temperatures began to increase while the monsoon strength-
ened, and the summer precipitation became more significant
for Dasuopu An variability.
[34] Snow accumulation was low in the northeast Tibetan
Plateau during the LIA, which may have been a result of
weaker Asian monsoon circulation during this period of
cold Asian land temperatures. The increase in Dunde An
along with lower ice core isotope-inferred temperatures
over decadal periods suggests that the climate here may
have been more influenced by westerly low-pressure sys-
tems in the summer and especially in the winter. This
continental-derived precipitation may have dominated as
the monsoon circulation, which is relatively weak in this
region even under climates that favor it, was restricted to the
south. Today the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is on the
extreme edge of the summer monsoon regime, so any
weakening of the monsoon might place this area outside
its influence.

[35] After 1880, the winter storms decreased in the central
Himalayas as the effects of the North Atlantic atmospheric
processes diminished and the regional and hemispheric
climate ameliorated, facilitating spring melting of the snow
cover in the lower elevations. The precipitation on the
Dasuopu ice cap more resembled the summer monsoon
rainfall record to the south. Meanwhile, to the north the
Dunde An fluctuated greatly, increasing over three-fold and
reaching a maximum at 1884, then falling back in six years
to LIA levels, then climbing again to a record high by 1920.
The west Pacific SSTs and the summertime Southern
Oscillation settled into their monsoon relationships with
the ice core record (high SST, positive SOI, high Dunde An)
in the mid-1890s, more than a decade after the decrease in
Himalayan winter snow. However, the Asian land temper-
atures did not achieve a positive relationship with monsoon
accumulation until 1910, which they have maintained
until the 1970s. This suggests that after the end of the
LIA as the recent warming got underway, the ocean
processes may have been more influential in expanding
the monsoon influence towards the north and west. In fact,
even during the twentieth century the correlations of the ice
core accumulation with the Pacific Basin atmospheric and
oceanic processes are more significant than with the land
temperatures on decadal and shorter timescales, whereas
land temperature variations are more influential over multi-
decadal and centennial periods.
[36] The appearance of post-LIA similarities between the
Indian Ocean coral-inferred SSTs and the ice core-inferred
south Asian monsoon strength demonstrates that Indian
Ocean processes also influence the monsoon regime. The
decadal signals from western Indian Ocean coral records
reflect tropical ocean, particularly Pacific Basin, processes
[Charles et al., 2003]. Thus the south Asian monsoon and
the Indian Ocean are linked through the tropical Pacific and
ENSO.
7. Conclusions
[37] Changes in precipitation and temperature on the
Tibetan Plateau which affect the extent and thickness of
snow and ice have direct and indirect implications for water
resources and agriculture in western China, Pakistan, India,
and Southeast Asia, especially since major rivers such as the
Yangtze, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra
originate in Tibet and the Himalayas. The comparisons of
temperature proxy records from the land and the oceans
with ice core accumulation data are useful for reconstructing
variations in the relative influences of these end members of
the thermal gradient, which is the active monsoon’s basic
driver. Analysis of climate histories from ice core and coral
proxy records of temperature and monsoon strength sug-
gests that over the last century monsoon derived precipita-
tion in the northeast Tibetan Plateau was associated more
closely with tropical SST than with temperature changes
over Asia on decadal and shorter timescales. However,
during the Little Ice Age cold period in the nineteenth
century North Atlantic and Eurasian atmospheric circulation
and Asian land temperatures may have exerted more influ-
ence than did tropical processes. The Dunde and Dasuopu
glaciers, located on the edges of the Tibetan Plateau, may be
situated in critical regions where tropical and high latitude
climate regimes compete as the Northern Hemisphere shifts
in and out of neoglacial (and glacial) modes. This may be
important to consider while reconstructing and interpreting
the paleoclimate histories from longer ice core and other
proxy records from the Plateau.
[38] Up until the middle 1970s, ENSO seemed to have an
effect on monsoon strength, but since then the accelerating
climatic warming may have resulted in land temperatures
playing a more important role in the thermal gradient that
drives the monsoon circulation [Ashrit et al., 2001]. Unfor-
tunately, this recent relationship cannot be reconstructed
from Tibetan Plateau ice core records, since tropical and
temperate glaciers in this region have been experiencing
rapid and accelerating retreat, thus disrupting their recent
climatic records.
