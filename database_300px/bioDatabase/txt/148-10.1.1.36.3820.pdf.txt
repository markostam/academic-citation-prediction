ABSTRACT
Based on parameters governing promoter activity and
using regulatory elements of the lac, ara and tet operon
transcription control sequences were composed which
permit the regulation in Escherichia coli of several gene
activities independently and quantitatively. The novel
promoter PLtetO-1 allows the regulation of gene express-
ion over an up to 5000-fold range with anhydrotetracy-
cline (aTc) whereas with IPTG and arabinose the activity
of Plac/ara-1 may be controlled 1800-fold. Escherichia
coli host strains which produce defined amounts of the
regulatory proteins, Lac and Tet repressor as well as
AraC from chromosomally located expression units
provide highly reproducible in vivo conditions. Control-
ling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase,
the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction
endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high
levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests
that under conditions of optimal repression only around
one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This
potential of quantitative control will open up new
approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in
particular with low abundance regulatory gene prod-
ucts. The system will also provide new opportunities for
the controlled expression of heterologous genes.
INTRODUCTION
Genetic switches which permit the control of individual gene
activities quantitatively and specifically will greatly facilitate the
study of gene function in vivo. They would be particularly useful
for the analysis of phenotypes which arise through small
perturbations of sensitive equilibria. The signalling pathway of
the heat shock response (1) or the control of cell division (2) may
be just two of many examples.
In the past, regulated promoters of the Escherichia coli system
such as PL of phage lambda and the promoter of the lac operon
as well as some of its derivatives have been widely used to control
gene expression (3–5). Moreover, the specialized RNA polymerase/
promoter system of phages T7 and T3 was applied when
particularly tight control appeared to be required (6,7). While
useful in a great number of applications, these systems have
serious limitations. Thus, PL is commonly induced by inactivating
the repressor cI 857 via a temperature shift. This induction
principle does not permit quantitative control over time and, in
addition, causes pleiotropic effects. Similar limitations exist for
experimental schemes where the introduction of, for example,
phage T7 RNA polymerase into a cell via phage infection
activates a gene (8). On the other hand, the promoter of the lac
operon, Plac, a well regulatable promoter of intermediate strength
depends on the activation by CRP/cAMP. This activating complex
affects, however, many additional operons and thus profoundly
changes the metabolic state of the cell when switched into its
active form by cAMP. The Plac derivative, Ptac (4) and similar
constructs like Ptrc or Ptic (9) which do not depend on activation
are repressed to a reasonable extent only at Lac repressor
concentrations which hardly allow full induction. The more
recently described systems where promoters of the ara (10) and
the (Tn10) tet operon (11) were employed are useful alternatives;
their range of regulation and their tightness in the repressed state
may, however, fall short when compared with the system
described here although we have not performed direct comparisons.
Here we describe a system for the quantitative and independent
control of two transcription units in E.coli. The centerpiece of the
system are regulatable promoters which were developed follow-
ing principles described earlier (12). They are controlled by
elements of the lac, ara or tet (Tn10) operon and, accordingly,
promoter activities are sensitive towards IPTG, arabinose or
tetracycline, respectively. These promoters are tightly repressible
and can be regulated over an up to 5000-fold range. By varying
the plasmid copy number the regulatory range of these promoters
can be shifted to span different windows. Escherichia coli strains
which produce defined amounts of Lac and Tet repressor (LacR,
TetR) as well as of AraC ensure reliable intracellular conditions.
The tightness of the system is demonstrated by quantitative
control of a low abundance protein of E.coli as well as by the
stable maintenance of a gene encoding a restriction endonuclease.
This endonuclease is upon induction efficiently overproduced
despite of the immediate growth arrest of the culture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of the pZ vector system
Modules II and III of the pZ vectors (Fig. 2) were synthesized by
PCR (13) using various templates. The resistance genes were
amplified together with their genuine promoters by primers

Figure 1. Topography and sequences of promoters. All promoter sequences which are aligned via the –10 hexamer are flanked by XhoI (upstream) and EcoRI (downstream)
cleavage sites whose sequences are not shown. The –10 and –33 hexamers are boxed and the transcriptional start site is underlined. Bars indicate the lac (lacO) and the tet
(tetO) operators as well as the I1-I2 binding site of AraC. O1 denotes the corresponding operator sequence in the lac operon, Os is a symmetrical 20 bp synthetic operator
(15). O2 indicates the corresponding operator sequence in the Tn10 tetracycline resistance operon (50). An additional O1 sequence is indicated further upstream (at –448)
of Plac/ara-1. The central base pair of the operators is indicated. The roman numbers III–VI give the positions of the operators relative to  the promoter.
which introduced the flanking restriction sites SacI and AatII.
Similarly, ColE1 and p15A origins of replication were produced
to be flanked by restriction sites AvrII and SpeI except for the
replication region of pSC101 or pSC101* which contain an
internal SpeI site (Fig. 2). The following plasmids served as
templates to retrieve various components for the pZ plasmid
family: pDS12 (14) for the ColE1 origin, the terminators T1 of the
rrnB operon and t0 of phage lambda as well as the gene conferring
resistance to ampicillin (Ap); pDM1.1 (15) for the p15A origin
and the kanamycin (Kn) resistance gene; pACYC184 (16) for the
gene encoding chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance; pBluc (17) for
the luciferase gene; pSC101 (18) for the pSC101 origin; pBB1
(B. Bukau, unpublished) for the gene conferring resistance to
Spectinomycin (Sp); pLDR11 (19) for the lambda attP site. The
pSC101* origin is derived from the origin of replication of
pMPP6 (20) by PCR using a proper mismatch primer.
To assemble the integration vector pZS4Int-1 the laciq allele
was retrieved from pDM1.1 (15), the tetR gene from pDM1.700
(21) and promoter PN25 from pDS1 (22). The sequences of
representative members of the pZ vector family were submitted
to the GenBank database (accession numbers U66308–U66313).
Construction of promoters
Promoters PLlacO-1, PA1lacO-1, PLtetO-1 and Plac/ara-1 were ob-
tained by total synthesis. The lac operator O1 upstream of
Plac/ara-1 was introduced via a PCR primer with the corresponding
overhang and cloned as a 5′-AatII–XhoI-3′ fragment upstream of
the promoter. The intervening sequence between the promoter
and the upstream operator was derived from the human c-myc
gene (23) to minimize recombination and potential transcriptional
signalling. After cloning, all promoter sequences were verified by
dideoxy sequencing (24).
Cloning of the restriction endonuclease Cfr9I
The gene encoding restriction endonuclease Cfr9I was amplified
from vector pCfr9I2.3X (25) by PCR and cloned into vectors
pZS*24 and pZA24, respectively, via KpnI/XbaI or EcoRI/XbaI.
The utilization of the KpnI cleavage site resulted in a mRNA with
a strong RBS, whereas the RBS generated via EcoRI was ∼10
times less efficient.
Construction of E.coli strain DH5αZ1
Escherichia  coli strain DH5αZ1 was obtained following the
description of Diederich et al. (19). For integration of plasmids
of the pZ series into the chromosome, the lambda attP site pLDR8
was cloned into the AvrII site of pZS4Int. For integration, the
origin of replication was removed by cleavage with SpeI and
AvrII (generating compatible cohesive ends) and the religated
fragment was transferred to E.coli DH5αpLDR8 by electroporation.
Cells were incubated for 2 h at 42C and then at 37C overnight
and transformants were selected on LB Sp[50 µg/ml] plates.
Determination of in vivo promoter activities
Promoters PLlacO-1, PLtetO-1 and Plac–ara-1, respectively, were
inserted into plasmids of the pZ series and the expression of the
eukaryotic luciferase gene of Photinus pyralis (17,26) was
measured by monitoring its enzymatic activity. Overnight
cultures of E.coli cells DH5αZ1 grown at 37C in LB medium
containing the appropriate antibiotics were diluted 1:100 in LB
medium in presence or absence of various inducers [1 mM IPTG,
L(+)-arabinose, anhydrotetracycline] at concentrations indicated.
After 3 h, the OD600 was measured and the cultures were kept at
room temperature for 15 min. To determine luciferase activities
in crude extracts of logarithmically growing cultures 3 ml cells
were sedimented, resuspended in 50 µl lysis buffer (1 mM EDTA,
1 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min.
Upon addition of 300 µl H2O and 300 µl buffer I (100 mM
KH2PO4, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.8) 35 µl were mixed with 250 µl
buffer II (15 mM MgSO4, 25 mM glycylglycin, 2.5 mM ATP) and
luciferase activity was measured (10 s, delay 0 s) in a Berthold
Lumat type LB9501. Activities are given as ‘relative light units’
(RLU) after subtraction of the instrumental background and
normalization to the number of viable cells (27).
Enzymes, antibodies, media and chemicals
Standard DNA manipulations were carried out as described (30).
All enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. DNA
sequencing reactions were performed using the Pharmacia T7
sequencing kit. Synthetic oligonucleotides and sequencing primers
were supplied by the inhouse facility. Antibiotics were added to
the growth medium at the following concentrations: 100 µg/ml

ampicillin, 40 µg/ml kanamycin; 25 µg/ml chloramphenicol and
50 µg/ml spectinomycin. Luciferin, IPTG and standard chemicals,
p.a. grade, were purchased from AppliChem, L(+)-arabinose from
Sigma while anhydrotetracycline was obtained from Acros.
Radiochemicals were purchased from Amersham & Buchler.
Anti-DnaJ rabbit serum for immunoblots, prepared in house,
was diluted 1:7500 for the preparation of immunoblots. Specific
antibody–DnaJ complexes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) as described (29).
RESULTS
Rational of promoter designs
The decisive parameter for the efficient repression of promoters
where repressors interfere directly with the binding of RNA
polymerase is the rate of complex formation (kON) between RNA
polymerase and promoter (15). Promoters which bind RNA
polymerase at low rates are well repressed since they give the
binding of the repressor a competitive advantage. Such promoters,
however, remain weak upon induction unless they are activated
as, for example, is the case for Plac. By contrast, promoters which
are strong in the absence of any activator bind RNA polymerase
efficiently and can in general not be well repressed. We have
developed two classes of repressible promoters: those which,
after combination with operators, still initiate RNA synthesis
efficiently and those which require activation in the derepressed
state. The first class is derived from strong phage promoters such
as PL of phage lambda (31) and PA1 of phage T7 (32). Members
of the second class are derivatives of Plac. Sequences of the lac or
tet operator were inserted within the various promoters at
positions previously shown to be most effective (15), particularly
in the downstream or within the spacer region, position III and IV,
respectively (Fig. 1). Moreover, in some constructs the effect of
auxiliary operators of the lac system was exploited by placing a
third lac operator sequence in position VI upstream of the promoter
(Fig. 1). For activating ‘low kON promoters’, AraC has been
utilized which in contrast to CRP/cAMP acts highly specifically.
Construction of promoters controlled by TetR or LacR
Promoter PL of phage lambda has a low homology score and
binds RNA polymerase with a moderate forward rate constant of
1.1 × 107 M–1 s–1 (31). It is a strong promoter in vivo which,
nevertheless, can be tightly repressed by cI, the lambda repressor.
We have replaced the cI binding sites with sequences encoding
the operator 2 (tetO2) of the Tn10 tetracycline resistance operon
(33). The resulting 74 bp promoter–operator sequence, PLtetO-1,
obtained by oligonucleotide synthesis contains a tetO2 sequence
in position V and a 18 bp tetO2 core sequence in the spacer region
(Fig. 1). PLtetO-1 is tightly repressible by the Tet repressor and can
be regulated over an up to 5000-fold range by supplying
anhydrotetracycline (aTc) to the culture (Table 1a). In an analogous
way, lacO1 sequences were integrated into PL (Fig. 1): an 18 bp
sequence in the spacer region (overlapping by 1 bp with the –33
hexamer) and a 22 bp sequence upstream of the promoter centred
around position –43 (overlapping by 2 bp with the –33 hexamer).
The activity of the resulting promoter PLlacO-1 can be regulated
over a >600-fold range by IPTG in E.coli DH5αZ1 (Table 1a).
Previously we have modified PA1 of phage T7 in a similar
fashion (Lanzer and Bujard, unpublished) by inserting two lac
operator sequences into position III and IV, i.e. into the spacer and
Table 1. (a) Induction and repression of PLtetO-1, PLlacO-1 and PA1lacO-1 in
E.coli DH5αZ1. (b) Induction and repression of Plac/ara-1 in E.coli DH5αZ1
Promoters were inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in the pZ vectors
containing the origin of replication indicated. The various constructs were
transfered into E.coli DH5αZ1. Overnight cultures of such transformants
were diluted 1:100 in LB medium and grown up in presence or absence of aTc
or IPTG, respectively. The concentration of aTc was 100 ng/ml, of IPTG 1 mM.
At OD600 = 0.5, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined.
The luciferase activities given are the mean values of five independent experiments
(standard deviation <10%). The intracellular copy numbers were determined
by comparing luciferase activity of cells harbouring the respective plasmids
with the activity in cells containing only a single luciferase expression unit
integrated in the chromosome (data not shown). They agree well with previously
published data derived from direct copy number measurements (14). In Table 1b,
Plac/ara-1 was induced either by 1 mM IPTG alone or by 1 mM IPTG and
L(+)-arabinose (0.05%).
the downstream region (Fig. 1). This strong promoter binds RNA
polymerase with a relatively high forward rate constant (34) and
although the lac operator sequence in position III reduces the rate
of promoter clearance (22), PA1lacO-1 remains a strong promoter
in vivo when derepressed. At Lac repressor concentrations as in
E.coli DH5αZ1, this promoter can be regulated over a 350-fold
range by IPTG (Table 1a).
A promoter controlled by LacR and AraC
Plac, when derepressed by IPTG and activated by CRP/cAMP, is
a promoter of intermediate activity in vivo (32). Some mutants of
Plac show increased activity in vivo but remain susceptible to
repression as well as activation. One of these mutant promoters
is Plac-8A. It differs from the wild type by a single T to A base
change at position –8 (Fig. 1) and has a 3-fold higher promoter
strength in vivo when compared with Plac (35). Since Plac-8A has
still a low homology score and consequently binds RNA polymerase
rather slowly, it is tightly repressible and can be activated by

Figure 2. The pZ vector system. (a) Overall outlay. The plasmids are
composed of three modules which are separated by the unique cleavage sites
XhoI/AatII, XbaI and SacI as indicated in the scheme in the upper part. Module
I contains the signals for transcriptional regulation, i.e. promoter/operator
constructs as well as a ribosomal binding site (RBS) which both can be
exchanged by unique cleavage sites [XhoI(AatII)/EcoRI or EcoRI/KpnI,
respectively]. This module contains also one of two multiple cloning sites
(MCS 1, 2) for the integration of a gene of interest. Module II harbours one of
four origins of replication (ColE1, p15A, pSC101, pSC101*). They are
shielded from readthrough transcription by terminator T1 of the rrnB operon
and t0 of phage lambda. Module III contains one of four antibiotic resistance
markers which carry their genuine promoters and ribosomal binding sites. The
lower part shows some standard pZ plasmids with their designation as
explained in (b). (b) Nomenclature of the pZ vector system. The second letter
of the pZ plasmid denotes the origin of replication (E through S*) and the first
number indicates the resistance marker (1–4). The second number (1–4)
defines the promoter controlling the transcription of the gene of interest. The
MCS or the description of the gene of interest follows this code as exemplified
for the three plasmids in (a).
CRP/cAMP (35). To convert Plac-8A into a well regulatable
promoter, we have introduced three modifications. First, a
symmetrical 20 bp lac operator sequence (Os, Fig. 1) was placed
in the spacer region. Second, a 35 bp wild-type operator sequence
(lacO1) was integrated upstream of the promoter at position –448
following principles described previously (36–38). Third, the
CRP/cAMP binding site was deleted and replaced by the I1/I2
recognition site of AraC, the repressor–inducer of the BAD
promoter of the ara operon (39). To maintain the –35 hexamer of
Plac-8A and to centre the I1/I2 sequence around –53 as in the ara
operon, 5 bp of the I2 site were abolished. The resulting Plac/ara-1
was examined for its regulatory potential in E.coli as described
below. As shown in Table 1b, this promoter can be regulated over
an ∼1800-fold range whereby derepression via IPTG causes an
∼100-fold and activation via arabinose a 15–20-fold increase in
promoter activity.
The pZ vector system
The vectors depicted in Figure 2 emerged from our earlier
developments, the pBU (40), pDS (14) and pUH (Lanzer and
Bujard, unpublished) series. The salient feature of the pZ plasmids
is their modular structure. Module I contains all the regulatory
elements which control the expression of a gene of interest i.e. the
regulatable promoter, a ribosomal binding site (RBS) and a
transcriptional terminator. In the basic pZ plasmid, this module
harbours multiple cloning sites (MCS). The transcriptional signals
as well as the RBS can be exchanged using unique cleavage sites.
Module II contains an origin of replication which is protected from
outside transcriptional readthrough (14) by two terminators. Four
origins of replication were adjusted to fit into the system via unique
cleavage sites. This permits the variation of the plasmid copy
number as well as of the compatibility group. Thus, when the ColE1,
the p15A or the pSC101 origin of replication is used, intracellular
copy numbers of 50–70, 20–30 and 10–12, respectively, are
established. Particularly low copy numbers are achieved with the
origin of pMPP6 (20), a derivative of pSC101 which gives rise to
only three to four plasmids per cell and is referred to in our system
as pSC101* origin. Finally, module III carries a resistance marker
and the genes encoding ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and
spectinomycin resistance together with their genuine transcription
and translation signals were again adjusted to fit into the constructs
via unique cleavage sites. The nomenclature of the pZ plasmid
family is explained in Figure 2. Of particular interest for the study
here were the plasmids which contain a modified luciferase gene
(17) as reporter for promoter activity. The effect of using different
origins of replication led to a 15–20-fold shift of the regulatory
window. This is most clearly demonstrated by comparing the
luciferase activities in the repressed state of PLtetO-1 and Plac/ara-1
when integrated into pZE, pZA and pZS* (Table 1).
The E.coli host strain DH5αZ1
To ensure stable and defined conditions for the synthesis and
maintenance of the regulatory proteins TetR and LacR, the genes
encoding these two repressor molecules were placed under the
control of the two constitutive promoters PN25 and the laciq
promoter Piq (41), respectively, and integrated in tandem into the
chromosome of E.coli strain DH5α at the phage lambda
attachment site (42) as outlined in Figure 3. Analysis of several
spectinomycin-resistant colonies by Southern blot analysis (data
not shown) showed that the two transcription units encoding TetR
and LacR as well as the spectinomycin resistance marker were
stably integrated in the DH5α genome. The resulting strain,
DH5αZ1, produces ∼3000 molecules of LacR and around 7000
molecules of TetR per cell as determined by ELISA and Western
blot (data not shown). Since E.coli DH5αZ1 is a genuine producer
of AraC, all regulatory proteins required are constitutively syn-
thesized in the cells which were used throughout the experiments
described here. The entire unit encoding LacR, TetR and Spr can
be readily transferred to other E.coli strains by phage P1
transduction as exemplified for the widely used W3110 strain
which led to E.coli W3110Z1 (data not shown).
Regulation of the activity of promoters PLtetO-1, PLlacO-1,
PA1lacO-1 and Plac/ara-1
Promoter PLtetO-1 is controlled by the operator repressor system
of the Tn10-derived tet resistance operon. Accordingly it is

Figure 3. Integration of transcription units encoding LacR and TetR into the
E.coli genome. The two repressor-encoding genes arranged in tandem and
controlled by the promoter Placiq and PN25 respectively were inserted into
pZS4Int1 carrying the phage lambda attachment site at attP. Upon cleavage by
SpeI/AvrII and removal of the origin of replication, the compatible ends were
ligated. Escherichia  coli cells containing plasmid pLDR8, a thermosensitive
plasmid encoding lambda integrase (19), were transformed with the ligated
DNA and after incubation at non-permissive temperatures spectinomycin-
resistant clones were selected and examined for the presence of the laci and tetR
transcription unit. The arrangement of these units in the chromosome is shown
in the lower part. Terminators t0 and T1 prevent transcription from the integrated
promoters into the neighbouring regions of the E.coli genome. The transcription
units can be readily transferred to other E.coli strains by phage P1 transduction.
induced by tetracyclines of which anhydrotetracycline is presently
the most suitable one. The other promoters are all induced by
IPTG and Plac/ara-1 can, in addition, be activated by L(+)arabinose.
The regulatory range of all promoters was determined using the
luciferase gene as reporter unit in absence and presence of the
respective inducers. To assess the influence of the intracellular
plasmid copy number, PLtetO-1 and Plac/ara-1 were inserted in
plasmids of the pZ-family containing the replication origin of
plasmids ColE1, p15A and pSC101*, respectively. The host
strain in all experiments was DH5αZ1. The most highly repressed
state and the largest regulation factor exceeding a 5000-fold range
was found with PLtetO-1 when carried on a low copy number
plasmid (Table 1a). Higher intracellular plasmid numbers increased
the luciferase activity accordingly (7-fold for p15A and 15-fold
for ColE1). The luciferase activities in the repressed state did,
however, correlate only qualitatively with the copy number. Both
PLlacO-1 and PA1lacO-1 are repressed to about the same level.
However, since upon induction PLlacO-1 produces twice the
amount of luciferase, its regulation factor is higher (620- versus
350-fold). Examining Plac/ara-1, a regulatory range of
1700–1800-fold is found irrespective of the intracellular plasmid
copy number which, nevertheless, affects the absolute values of
repression and induction (Table 1b). The lowest luciferase activity
in the repressed state was again observed with plasmids of the
pZS* series as expected. For all promoters, the activity in the fully
induced state was identical to their activity in the repressor-free
strain DH5α (data not shown).
The potential to quantitatively control a gene activity with the
promoters described is exemplified by experiments depicted in
Figure 4. The luciferase gene as well as the gene encoding the low
abundance E.coli chaperone DnaJ were placed under the control
of PLtetO-1, PLlacO-1 and Plac/ara-1, respectively and the activity of
the promoters was analyzed at various concentrations of inducers.
The dose response curves show that partial induction can be
achieved with all promoters and that Plac/ara-1 can be tuned
particularly well since induction with IPTG and activation with
arabinose allows a high degree of differentiation. The induction
curve of promoter PLtetO-1 suggests a strong cooperative effect in
the binding of the inducer aTc to the Tet repressor. The same
phenomenon was observed with several other TetR regulated
constructs (data not shown). The lower part of Figure 4 shows the
controlled expression of DnaJ. Western blots demonstrate that the
repressed state is hardly different from the cellular background
(∼100 DnaJ molecules/cell) (43) whereas full induction yields
high levels of expression with all three promoters.
Cloning and expression of a gene encoding restriction
endonuclease Cfr91
Based on earlier results (44,45) it can be estimated that under
repression conditions promoters like PLtetO-1 and Plac/ara-1 when
placed on a low copy number plasmid such as pZS* produce less
than one mRNA per cell. This should permit the cloning of genes
encoding highly toxic products. To test this prediction, the gene of
the Cfr9I restriction endonuclease was cloned in absence of its
cognate methyltransferase. The coding sequence of Cfr9I was
placed under the control of Plac/ara-1 in plasmids pZS*24∆RBS,
pZA24∆RBS (where RBSII was deleted) and pZA24. In all three
plasmids, the gene could be stably maintained in DH5αZ1 and
growth rates of cells harbouring pZS*24∆RBS-cfr were indistin-
guishable from cells without any plasmid (Fig. 5a). However, cells
containing pZA24-cfr formed colonies with a mucoid phenotype.
Induction of transcription by IPTG or by IPTG and arabinose led
to immediate growth arrest of the culture (Fig. 5b and c). Since in
E.coli protein synthesis can continue for some time after the
destruction of chromosomal DNA (46) the feasibility of producing
Cfr9I endonuclease in DH5αZ1 was examined. Indeed using
pZA24-cfr, the endonuclease could be produced to a level
corresponding to ∼2% of the total cellular protein, despite
immediate growth arrest of the culture upon induction (Fig. 5d).
DISCUSSION
The transcription control systems described here expand our
capabilities of studying gene function in vivo. First, gene
activities can be regulated over a wide range spanning more than
three orders of magnitude but more importantly they can be
repressed extremely tightly. This opens up the possibility of
varying the concentrations of regulatory proteins which, under
physiological conditions, are present at very low levels. Examples
for such proteins may be the central heat shock regulator of E.coli
σ32, the chaperone DnaJ or ftsZ, a crucial component in the
signalling pathway of cell division. Second, by exploiting the three
regulatory principles, LacR/O, TetR/O and AraC/I1-I2, several
gene activities can be independently regulated. This will allow the
analysis of intracellular equilibria by varying the concentrations of
participants and elucidate their contribution to a phenotype.
The crucial developments for the expression system described
here were the promoter–operator combinations which were
conceived following principles described earlier (12,15). Accord-
ingly, promoters were selected which exhibit low or intermediate
rates of complex formation with RNA polymerase. Moreover,
operators were positioned in regions shown to be most effective.
Thus, provided a 17–19 bp operator sequence binds a repressor
sufficiently tightly, it can be accommodated in the spacer region
of a promoter where it interferes with RNA polymerase binding
most efficiently (15) and where it perturbs least the functional

program of a promoter. The second best choice for placing an
operator is position III where the lac operator sequence, however,
diminishes promoter clearance by RNA polymerase (22).
For the first class of regulatable promoters, PL of phage lambda
served as a paradigm. It is a strong and highly repressible
promoter in vivo which, however, binds RNA polymerase with a
moderate forward rate constant. By combining this promoter with
tet operators, PLtetO-1 was obtained whose activity can be
controlled via TetR and anhydrotetracycline. It is a strong
promoter in vivo and can, nevertheless, be repressed up to
5000-fold in E.coli DH5αZ1. This is the widest range of
regulation measured for any E.coli promoter so far using the
Luciferase reporter system. Partial induction of PLtetO-1 is
achieved by varying the concentration of aTc (Fig. 4a). In contrast
to tetracycline, anhydrotetracycline is a particularly useful
inducer. It binds TetR with an ∼35-fold higher binding constant
and thus allows to operate at very low concentrations. At the same
time, its antibiotic activity is ∼100-fold lower (47) and concentra-
tions of <50 ng/ml as required for the full induction of PLtetO-1
have no effect on the growth of E.coli. The finding that repression
is less effective at higher plasmid copy numbers may be due to the
different ratio of operators to repressors as well as to the increase
in unspecific binding sites which affects the concentration of free
repressor. Following the same strategy but using the lac operator
sequences, PLlacO-1 was constructed. It is a strong promoter
which can be regulated over a >600-fold range. From the results
shown in Table 1, we anticipate that placing this promoter into
low copy number plasmids, it will permit a similar tight
repression of transcription as PLtetO-1 and will therefore also be
suitable for controlling gene products at very low intracellular
levels. Promoter PA1lacO-1 contains one of its lac operators in
position III (Fig. 1) which limits the rate of promoter clearance by
RNA polymerase. Thus, it is a somewhat weaker promoter which,
nevertheless, is well regulatable (Table 1a).
While PL is an example for a highly repressible, strong
promoter with a moderate kON, Plac is an example for a promoter
whose high repressibility is due to its low rate of polymerase
binding. This, however, limits its activity in the derepressed state.
For full activity it requires the upstream binding of CRP/cAMP.
But even when fully activated, Plac remains a moderately strong
promoter. Examining a number of Plac mutants, Plac-8A exhibited
interesting features: its in vivo strength when derepressed but not
activated was 16 times but its kON only three times higher than that
of Plac. It also could still be activated by CRP/cAMP. The
repressibility of this promoter was optimized by introducing a
symmetrical 20 bp lacO sequence into the spacer region (overlap-
ping with the –10 and the –35 hexamer by 1 bp each) and by
placing a third operator at position VI (Fig. 1). To avoid pleiotropic
effects by CRP/cAMP activation, the AraC binding site I1-I2 of the
ara BAD promoter replaced the CRP/cAMP site. The resulting

promoter (Plac/ara-1) is regulatable over an ∼1800-fold range and
when fully induced and activated it exceeds the in vivo strength of
Plac 6-fold. Thus, it is a strong and highly regulatable promoter. The
fine tuning of Plac/ara-1 is facilitated by a two step mechanism:
increasing the IPTG concentration in the medium up to 0.2 mM
leads to an ∼100-fold induction which can be enhanced 15–20-fold
by adding arabinose to a final concentration of 0.03% (Fig. 4c).
Addition of glucose (0.6%) to the growth medium decreased
the activation potential of AraC 2–3-fold (data not shown). This
is most likely due to the reduction of araC transcription which is
controlled by CRP/cAMP (48). This glucose effect can of course
be avoided by replacing glucose with glycerol or other non-PTS
sugars as a primary carbon source when, for example, minimal
medium is required for culturing.
Repression and induction depend on a number of parameters
such as the concentration of free repressor and the increment by
which an inducer decreases the affinity of a repressor to its
operator. Free repressor concentration is also a function of the
number of unspecific (and specific) DNA binding sites and may
thus be affected by plasmid copy number and size although this
is a minor parameter with the plasmids described herein. A simple
increase of the intracellular repressor concentration on the other
hand does not necessarily compensate for this effect since the
residual affinity of the repressor–inducer complex to the respective
operator sequence prevents full induction as seen for both TetR
and LacR (data not shown). Moreover, high repressor concentrations
may be toxic for the cell as is the case for TetR (ref. 49 and our
unpublished results). Incomplete induction is frequently encountered
with the widely used tac or trc type promoter systems because
these high ‘kON’ promoters are reasonably well repressed only at
very high intracellular repressor concentrations. When examined
under conditions as defined in Table 1 repression of these
promoters is only 10–20-fold (data not shown). It is therefore
important to establish stable intracellular conditions where the
relevant regulatory proteins are present in defined concentrations
which warrant a reliable control of promoters under various
physiological conditions. This was achieved by integrating the
laci as well as the tetR gene controlled by promoters of
appropriate in vivo strength into the E.coli chromosome. The high
‘kON’ constitutive promoters Piq and PN25 ensure efficient
transcription even under conditions of reduced concentration of
active σ70 RNA polymerase e.g. in stationary phase. The resulting
E.coli strains DH5αZ1 and W3110Z1 produce constitutively
around 3000 tetrameric Lac and 7000 dimeric Tet repressors per
cell during logarithmic growth. Sufficient AraC is supplied by its
natural autoregulated pathway as its overproduction from a
plasmid did not lead to increased activation of Plac/ara-1 (data not
shown). Thus, E.coli strains of the DH5αZ1 type provide all
regulatory proteins required in appropriate amounts for tight
repression and full induction (which is indistinguishable from
repressor-free host strains; data not shown) at different plasmid
copy numbers. The tight repression is maintained also in
stationary phase and in overnight cultures (data not shown). The
placement of repressor encoding units onto the chromosome has
also simplified the vector constructs and increased the degree of
freedom of the system.
Although the regulatory range of the promoters described is
large, it may not satisfy all needs. For example for the tight control
of a low abundance or toxic gene product, even the fully repressed
PLtetO-1 may generate a too high background when contained in
a ColE1-type plasmid. The vector system therefore offers still
another degree of freedom. By utilizing different origins of
replication, the intracellular number of plasmids can be varied
between ∼4 and 60, which permits to shift the regulatory window
 Nucleic Acids Research, 1997, Vol. 25, No. 61210
of a promoter within an ∼15-fold range. Thus, by fully exploiting
the potential of the system using, for example PLtetO-1, a gene’s
activity can be controlled over an ∼60 000-fold range. The
controlled synthesis of a restriction endonuclease, a low abun-
dance E.coli protein and luciferase under different conditions as
exemplified in Figures 4 and 5 illustrates some of these aspects.
Needless to say that three of the replication origins adjusted to fit
the vector system belong to different plasmid compatibility
groups and thus permit to maintain two or even three vectors
within DH5αZ1 cells if required.
It may be of interest to speculate on the absolute tightness
achieved, for example, with PLtetO-1 in DH5αZ1 cells. When
fully induced, this promoter has an activity of ∼30 Pbla units (45)
and is estimated to initiate transcription ∼5-fold less frequently
than the fully activated rrnBP1 promoter (12). The rrnBP1
promoter is estimated to initiate 1.5 mRNAs/s at maximal growth
rates during logarithmic growth (44). Hence, it can be estimated
that PLtetO-1 initiates 0.3 mRNAs/s. Given a generation time of 25
min for E.coli in log phase cultures a 5000-fold repression of this
promoter would reduce this rate to 6.5 × 10–5 mRNAs/s or in
other words one mRNA every 10th generation would be
synthesized in a single copy situation. Thus, PLtetO-1 located on a
plasmid of the pZS*-type giving rise to three to four copies/cell will
produce one mRNA about every 3rd generation. The luciferase
activity monitored with PLtetO-1 in the repressed state which
corresponds to an average of 12 enzyme molecules per cell is not
in disagreement with these estimates. This suggests that at the
repression levels achieved only a fraction of a cell population
synthesizes a given gene product at any one time. Populations
would therefore survive if this gene product was highly poisonous
as for example the restriction enzyme Cfr9I since only a minor
portion of cells would die.
The tight control of transcription, the potential to regulate gene
activities quantitatively over wide ranges and the possibility to
control independently several transcription units in a cell are the
main advantages of the system described here when compared to
other commonly used promoter/vector combinations. It thus
opens up new perspectives for the study of cellular physiology as
well as for the controlled expression of heterologous genes.
