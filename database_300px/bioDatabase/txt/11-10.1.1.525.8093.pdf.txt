ABSTRACT
Direct cloning and parallel sequencing, an extremely
powerful method for microRNA (miRNA)
discovery, has not yet been applied to bacterial tran-
scriptomes. Here we present sRNA-Seq, an unbi-
ased method that allows for interrogation of the
entire small, non-coding RNA (sRNA) repertoire
in any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism. This
method includes a novel treatment that depletes
total RNA fractions of highly abundant tRNAs and
small subunit rRNA, thereby enriching the starting
pool for sRNA transcripts with novel functionality.
As a proof-of-principle, we applied sRNA-Seq to
the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Our results
provide information, at unprecedented depth, on
the complexity of the sRNA component of a bacte-
rial transcriptome. From 407039 sequence reads,
all 20 known V. cholerae sRNAs, 500 new, putative
intergenic sRNAs and 127 putative antisense
sRNAs were identified in a limited number of
growth conditions examined. In addition, character-
ization of a subset of the newly identified transcripts
led to the identification of a novel sRNA regulator of
carbon metabolism. Collectively, these results
strongly suggest that the number of sRNAs in bac-
teria has been greatly underestimated and that
future efforts to analyze bacterial transcriptomes
will benefit from direct cloning and parallel sequen-
cing experiments aided by 5S/tRNA depletion.
INTRODUCTION
In bacteria, sRNAs that regulate diverse processes includ-
ing quorum sensing, bioﬁlm formation, stress responses,
and virulence have been described (1,2). Most sRNAs
characterized to date interact with speciﬁc mRNA targets,
modulating mRNA stability or the eﬃciency of transla-
tion (3). While several experimental and bioinformatic
approaches have proven useful in identifying sRNAs in
diverse species, it is widely accepted that these approaches
have yielded only a partial catalogue of these transcripts
(4,5). Bioinformatic approaches for discovery of sRNA-
encoding genes have often been limited to the subset of
loci associated with predictable transcriptional signals
and/or that are conserved in closely related species (6,7).
Moreover, these computational screens have almost
uniformly been limited to intergenic regions (IGRs) of
the genome. Although most known bacterial sRNAs are
encoded in IGRs, this does not preclude the possibility
that there are sRNAs that are expressed within, or anti-
sense (AS) to, protein coding sequences (4). Thus, even in
Escherichia coli, the species in which the most extensive
and diverse screens for sRNAs have been conducted, it has
been suggested that the 80 known sRNAs represent only
half of the entire sRNA repertoire (8).
Direct cloning, also known as shot-gun molecular clon-
ing, is an approach by which small RNAs are identiﬁed
through cDNA cloning of RNA transcripts. This method
allows the identiﬁcation of RNAs that are expressed in
an organism under a given set of conditions regardless
of whether they are encoded as distinct genetic elements
or are generated via post-transcriptional processing.
In recent years, direct cloning, in combination with paral-
lel sequencing technology, has enabled researchers
to ascertain the microRNA (miRNA) component of
several eukaryote transcriptomes, such as those of
Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana (9,10).
In addition, using RNA-Seq methodology the transcrip-
tome of Saccharomyces pombe, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana,
the laboratory mouse and human tissue have all been
recently mined (11–15). These studies collectively demon-
strate that previous transcriptome analyses have been

incomplete and suggest that parallel sequencing is neces-
sary for comprehensive identiﬁcation of transcribed
regions of the genome.
Massively parallel sequencing technology, or deep
sequencing, has only recently been used to explore the
transcriptomes of bacteria (16). In the lone example,
only those transcripts that interacted with the sRNA-
chaperone Hfq were sequenced. A major reason for this
lag in prokaryotic transcriptome analysis through deep
sequencing is the lack of a robust and readily adaptable
method of removing highly abundant housekeeping
RNAs, such as the tRNAs and rRNAs. Because they
are signiﬁcantly smaller than housekeeping RNAs, the
direct cloning and sequencing of eukaryotic miRNAs is
not hampered by abundant tRNA and rRNA sequences.
In order to deplete tRNA and rRNA from eukaryote
transcriptome analyses, the RNA-Seq technology uses
poly-adenylated (PolyA) mRNA as starting material for
direct cloning of mRNA populations. Bacterial sRNAs,
which are not poly-adenylated, range from 30 to 300 nt
in length, and are therefore not easily separated from the
tRNAs (70 nt) and 5S rRNA (120 nt) species during
RNA puriﬁcation. Several commercial kits exist for the
depletion of 16S and 23S rRNA from bacterial RNA pre-
parations through either hybridization-based physical
removal or ribonuclease activity. However, no methods
are available for the removal of small subunit rRNA or
bacterial tRNAs. A method was recently reported in
which PCR products from direct cloning of Drosophila
melanogaster small RNAs were screened prior to sequen-
cing using a ﬁlter hybridization technique (17). This
method, however, requires that each sequence be individ-
ually evaluated which may not be practical in massive-
scale sequencing experiments. We therefore reasoned
that a robust and unbiased method for the removal of
bacterial tRNAs and 5S rRNA was needed to allow for
more in depth analyses of prokaryotic transcriptomes,
particularly the sRNA component.
To investigate the sRNA component of bacterial tran-
scriptomes in an unbiased manner, we developed a
method to directly clone and analyze whole populations
of short bacterial transcripts, 14–200 nt in length, by par-
allel pyrosequencing (18). This protocol includes a treat-
ment that depletes total RNA fractions of tRNAs and 5S
rRNA, thereby enriching the starting pool for non-tRNA/
rRNA transcripts. Because both the RNA species targeted
for depletion and the size range of RNA to be sequenced
are user-deﬁned, sRNA-Seq represents a comprehensive
cloning protocol that is versatile and readily applicable
to the cloning of small RNAs of any size range from
any organism. Here we present a proof-of-principle exper-
iment in which we used sRNA-Seq to analyze Vibrio
cholerae sRNAs. V. cholerae is a gamma-proteobacterium
with a similar genome size and gene content as E. coli, and
is a facultative human pathogen that causes the severe
diarrheal disease cholera. Several sRNAs have been iden-
tiﬁed in V. cholerae through genetic screens and computa-
tional methods (19–21); it is likely, however, that more
sRNAs, which are involved in diverse gene regulatory
pathways, remain to be identiﬁed. Through the use
of sRNA-Seq, we report the sequencing of 407 039
V. cholerae small transcripts, providing unprecedented cov-
erage of the sRNA component of a bacterial transcriptome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial growth conditions
For sRNA-Seq and subsequent analysis of sRNA candi-
dates, V. cholerae El Tor O1 clinical isolates N16961 and
E7946, harboring derivatives of the pMMB67EH vector,
were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth at 378C with
aeration. For characterization of IGR7, V. cholerae
N16961 was grown in LB or M9 minimal media supple-
mented with trace metals (1ml/l of 5% MgSO4, 0.5%
MnCl24H2O, 0.5% FeCl3, 0.4% trinitriloacetic acid) and
either 0.4% glucose, 0.4% mannitol, or 0.4% glycerol.
Arabinose was added at 0.02% ﬁnal concentration to
induce expression from the ParaBAD promoter.
Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations:
100 mg/ml streptinomycin, 50 mg/ml ampicillin.
sRNA cloning
Each independent sample began with size-selecting
RNA on preparative gels (Supplementary Figure 1A).
For 14–60-nt transcripts (small fraction), 500 mg of total
RNA, derived from phenol/chloroform extraction and iso-
propanol precipitation, was size-selected on a 15% dena-
turing polyacrylamide gel. For 60–200-nt transcripts (large
fraction), 500 mg RNA was size selected on a 10% denatur-
ing polyacrylamide gel. In each case, the extracted product
was ligated to a 30 linker (Linker 1, IDT, 50-rAppCTGTAG
GCACCATCATT/3ddC/-30) as described (22,23). This
was followed by a second gel puriﬁcation; 1 nmol of the
Oligo Mix was added to the extracted, linkered-RNA prior
to ethanol precipitation. The Oligo Mix consisted of an
equal molar mixture of 29 oligos complementary to either
V. cholerae tRNAs or 5S rRNA (Supplementary Table 1).
The precipitated mixture was resuspended in buﬀer
(50mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8; 300mM KCl; 10mM MgCl2;
10mMDTT) (24), heated to 658C for 5min, slow-cooled to
378C, at which time 5 U RNaseH (NEB) was added. The
reaction mixture was incubated at 378C for 30min. The
depletion reaction was repeated for one additional cycle
followed by another gel puriﬁcation. The depleted, lin-
kered-product was reverse-transcribed using Superscript
II (Invitrogen) and the RT/REV primer (IDT, 50-GATT
GATGGTGCCTACAG) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. ExoSAP-IT (USB) was added directly to the
RT reaction, according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
to remove unused deoxynucleotides and primer. The reac-
tion was terminated by phenol:chloroform treatment and
ethanol precipitation, after which a second ligation was
performed as above using another 30 linker (Linker 2,
IDT, 50-rAppCACTCGGGCACCAAGGA/3ddC/-3) fol-
lowed by another gel puriﬁcation. The extracted material
was ampliﬁed by PCR for 20 cycles with the following
primers: Primer A: 50-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGG
ATTGATGGTGCCTACAG-30 and Primer B: 50-GCC
TTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGGTCCTTGGTGCCCGAGT
G-30 (sequences for 454 system underlined). The cDNA
libraries were puriﬁed on a native gel. For each

independent sample, the small and large fractions were
combined in a 1:2 molar ratio, and the samples were sub-
mitted directly to the 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer
20 system for sequencing using 454 Primer B (18).
Analysis of sequencing data
The starting materials for the bioinformatics pipeline
(Supplementary Figure 1B) were a set of four ﬁles in
FASTA format, containing the results of the 454 sequen-
cing runs for the four diﬀerent sRNA-Seq samples. These
ﬁles are provided herein as Supplementary Table 2. They
contain a total of 681 205 reads.
Step 1: Removal of linker sequences and collapse of iden-
tical reads. Each read was examined in turn. If the
sequence began with a complete 50 linker sequence and
ended with a complete 30 linker sequence, the read was
called a ‘perfect read’. Of the 681 205 total reads,
600 783 met this criterion. The remaining 80 422 reads
were called ‘imperfect reads’, but most of these reads con-
tained nearly complete linker sequences. The BLASTN
algorithm (parameters: W6 S1 e0.1) was used to
identify the extent of the imperfect linker sequences in
these reads. After linker sequences had been trimmed
from all perfect and imperfect reads, a set of ‘unique
sequences’ was created by collapsing together all reads
with identical sequences. There were a total of 172 872
unique sequences.
Step 2: Identification of contaminant-derived sequences.
Each unique sequence 14 nt or longer was compared using
BLASTN (parameters: e0.1) to a database containing
the following sequences:
(i) The genome of V. cholerae strain N16961 (Genbank
accession numbers NC_002505 and NC_002506).
(ii) The genome of S. cerevisiae (NC_001133 001148
and NC_001224).
(iii) Sequence of cloning plasmid pMMB67EH.
(iv) Several miscellaneous sequences from other species,
found to represent minor fractions of the contami-
nant pool.
The highest-scoring hit (ﬁrst hit in the output list) was
accepted as the source of the sequence. By setting an
E-value cutoﬀ of 0.1% in BLAST, any sequences 14 nt
or shorter were not assigned to the V. cholerae genome;
thus, sequences shorter than 15 nt were designated ‘short’.
Sequences that failed to match any sequence in the data-
base were designated ‘unidentiﬁed contaminant’.
A small fraction of the sequences were observed to
have the unusual structure ‘BXA’, where the sequence
‘AB’ matched a contiguous stretch of the V. cholerae (or
yeast) genome, and X was a short intervening sequence
that did not match any sequence in either genome.
These ‘shuﬄed’ sequences are believed to have formed
from a circularized intermediate in the cloning process,
although the details are unclear. For the purposes of the
downstream analyses, the genomic match of the shuﬄed
sequences was taken to be the full extent of ‘AB’, as
if the sequences had had a ‘normal’ linear structure.
The sequence of X, although usually very short (5 nt),
was occasionally longer; however, a limit of 100 nt was
imposed in the analysis.
Step 3: Genomic characterization of V. cholerae-derived
sequences. Each of the 100 742 unique sequences that
were found to match the V. cholerae genome was exam-
ined to determine what genomic features it overlapped
with. The list of features in NC_002505 and NC_002506
was supplemented with the 20 known V. cholerae sRNAs
that were previously conﬁrmed by northern blot analysis
(20,21). Most sequences overlapped only a single genomic
feature or else lay entirely in intergenic regions (IGR).
However, to deal systematically with cases of multiple
overlaps, the following procedure was applied to all
sequences. Each nucleotide along the length of the
sequence was tabulated as being in one of the following
nine classes: ORF, IGR, tRNA, rRNA, sRNA, or anti-
sense to ORF, tRNA, rRNA or sRNA. Because some sets
of overlapping sequences belonged to more than one of
these nine classes, the class with the greatest tabulated
count was accepted as the class of the sequence. For
IGR sequences, note was taken of the closest upstream
and downstream features and their distances.
Step 4: Merging of sequences with similar genomic end-
points into ‘transcripts’. Many of the 100 742 unique
V. cholerae sequences were very similar to each other,
only diﬀering by one or two additional nucleotides at
one or both ends. These diﬀerences may have resulted
from minor transcriptional heterogeneity, and/or
random events during the cloning. We wished to remove
this source of variation from the data and unify similar
sequences into putative ‘transcripts’. To accomplish this,
the following steps were taken. First, each list of sequences
was sorted by total number of reads, with the most fre-
quent sequence at the top of the list. Then, starting with
the sequence at the top of the list, all other sequences that
mapped to the same genomic region (same strand of the
same chromosome), with the starting and ending coordi-
nates both matching within 10 bp of that ﬁrst sequence,
were merged into a ‘transcript’ along with the ﬁrst
sequence, and their original entries were removed from
the list. This process continued down the list until all
sequences had been examined. At the end of this process,
the original 100 742 sequences had been merged into 16
825 transcripts. For each transcript, we calculated the
range (min and max), average, and standard deviation
of the length, 50 coordinate, and 30 coordinate
(Supplementary Table 3).
Step 5: Filtering of transcripts to create list of ‘candidate
sRNAs’. We applied additional criteria to remove likely
uninteresting entries from the transcript list. First, we
removed any transcript that was observed in only a
single sample out of the four independent samples. This
reduced the size of the list to 2846 transcripts. Next, we
removed transcripts of rRNA and tRNA, and transcripts
originating from the intergenic regions between rRNA
and tRNA genes. This further reduced the length of the
list to 2140 candidates.

Candidate sRNA analysis
Total RNA was prepared by phenol/chloroform extrac-
tion and isopropanol precipitation and represented sam-
ples independent from the ones used in the sRNA-Seq
experiment. Generally, northern blots were performed
with RNA probes transcribed from PCR-derived tem-
plates (Supplementary Table 4) with T7 promoters using
32P-UTP and T7 polymerase (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. In some cases, hybridiza-
tions were performed using DNA oligonucleotides
(Supplementary Table 4) 50-end-labeled with 33P-ATP.
Low molecular weight DNA ladder (NEB) was run along-
side RNA samples to provide estimations for the sizes of
RNA bands. Total RNA (10–40 mg) was run on denatur-
ing polyacrylamide gels (10% or 15%) and transferred to
Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham) in 1 TBE using
the Mini Trans-Blot Cell apparatus (Bio-Rad) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Blots were prehybri-
dized in Ultrahyb or Ultrahyb-oligo buﬀer (Ambion)
according to instructions.
Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed with
reverse primers speciﬁc to the sRNA candidate of interest
using the RETROscript kit (Ambion) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA generated,
or N16961 genomic DNA, was used as a template for
PCR with reverse and forward primers speciﬁc to each
candidate. PCR reactions were performed with an initial
denaturation step of 5min at 958C, followed by 26 cycles
of 30 s at 958C, 30 s at 558C, and 30 s at 728C. Control
reactions were performed for each run and included RNA
samples not treated with reverse transcriptase or samples
lacking template DNA. In all cases, no band was observed
in these controls. All primers used for this analysis are
listed in Supplementary Table 4.
Analysis of IGR7. The IGR7 sequence and its antisense
sequence were ampliﬁed by PCR (Supplementary Table 5)
and cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of pJML01.
This plasmid, generated by site-directed mutagenesis
(CTCCAT to GCTAGC), is a derivative of pBAD24
(25) with a new NheI site downstream of ParaBAD. sRNA
genes cloned behind the ParaBAD promoter in pJML01 are
expressed with the proper +1.
Growth of strains was determined by measured OD600
using a Bio-Tek microplate reader. For each strain, indi-
vidual colonies were ﬁrst grown in LB+arabinose for
2–3 h at 378C, at which time the cultures were centrifuged,
and the cell pellets washed and resuspended in M9
medium. The OD600 was adjusted to 0.01 in 200 ml of
M9-glycerol or M9-mannitol, with arabinose. Bacteria
were grown with aeration for 30 h at 378C in the micro-
plate reader. All growth experiments were performed in
triplicate.
For qRT–PCR analysis, bacteria were grown in LB or
M9 media at 378C with aeration. Total RNA was isolated
from mid-exponential phase cultures using the RNeasy
Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocols,
with a modiﬁcation to include sRNAs (<200 nt) in the
ﬁnal preparation (Qiagen). DNA was removed from
all samples using the DNAfree kit, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). cDNA
was made using 0.5 mg total RNA, speciﬁc primers, and
the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BioRad). qPCR reactions
were performed with iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(BioRad) using Strategene Mv3005P equipment and
MxPro qPCR software. At least three independent sam-
ples were tested for each condition and each template
sample was tested in duplicate. In all cases, controls lack-
ing reverse transcriptase were included and aﬀorded
results below the baseline of detection. All primers for
qRT–PCR analysis are listed in Supplementary Table 5.
RESULTS
Direct cloning and parallel sequencing ofV. cholerae sRNAs
Whereas miRNAs (20–22 nt) can be readily separated
from tRNA and rRNA sequences, bacterial sRNAs
often overlap in length with highly abundant tRNA and
5S rRNA transcripts. In order to address this problem, we
developed a 5S/tRNA depletion step that results in
an enrichment of sRNAs (23) (‘Materials and methods’
section and Supplementary Figure 1). Total RNA was
isolated from exponential or early-stationary phase
V. cholerae cultures. RNA (14–200 nt) was isolated and
a specialized 30 linker was ligated to the end of the tran-
scripts. The linkered-RNAs were then annealed to a pool
of oligodeoxynucleotides, each 29 nt, that were compli-
mentary to V. cholerae 5S rRNA and the 30-ends of
V. cholerae tRNA (Supplementary Table 1); the resulting
mixture was treated with RNaseH, which speciﬁcally tar-
gets DNA/RNA hybrids. This RNaseH treatment eﬀec-
tively removes tRNAs and 5S rRNA from downstream
analysis by separating these transcripts from the 30 linker
that is necessary for ampliﬁcation and addition of the 454
sequencing linkers. In addition, because the oligodeoxy-
nucleotides and RNaseH are not consumed in the reac-
tion, the depletion of 5S/tRNA proceeds enzymatically.
The 5S/tRNA-depleted pool of RNA was then used to
produce cDNA by reverse transcriptase and a second
linker was ligated to the 30-end of the cDNA products.
The linkered-cDNA products were ampliﬁed by PCR
and the amplicons submitted for sequencing with the
454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer 20 system (18).
Although the Solexa and SOLiD systems provide many
more sequence reads, we reasoned that the longer
(>100 nt) read lengths provided by the Genome
Sequencer system would facilitate unambiguous identiﬁca-
tion of bacterial sRNAs that can range up to several hun-
dred nucleotides.
Four independent samples were prepared, aﬀording
a total of 681 205 sequence reads of which 88% were full
length (with complete and perfect 50 and 30 linkers)
(Supplementary Table 2). The resulting sequences
trimmed of linkers had the length distribution shown in
Figure 1A. Using the BLASTN algorithm (E-value cutoﬀ
of 0.1) on the 626 351 reads 15 nt and longer, we found
that 407 039 of them matched the V. cholerae genome
(Table 1). Based on analysis of all possible n-mers,
of the 3066 unique 15 nt reads that we assigned as being

V. cholerae transcripts, it is likely that at most 0.4% of
them (12), are false positives. We also observed many
small transcripts that mapped to the yeast genome
(Table 1). We hypothesize that the media that the bacteria
were grown in was the source of these contaminating
sequences. Additional unidentiﬁed sequences may be the
result of trace DNA contaminating materials used during
the cloning process. Regardless of this contamination,
the large majority of the reads >40 nt mapped to the
V. cholerae genome. We observed that 73% of the
V. cholerae reads matched the genome perfectly, 12%
had one mismatch or gap, 6% had multiple mismatches
or gaps and a small fraction (9%) represented transcript
recombinations that were likely artifacts resulting from
the cloning process (‘BXA’ reads; see ‘Materials and
methods’ section). We then took all the 407 039 reads
that mapped to the V. cholerae genome and grouped
them into putative transcripts by combining sequences
with genomic coordinates that agreed within  10 bp at
each end. Based on this method of grouping reads
together, the sequences that mapped to the V. cholerae
genome represented 16 825 unique transcripts, 9% of
which corresponded to rRNA or tRNA sequences.
Overall, 34% of the total V. cholerae reads analyzed
were derived from rRNA or tRNA (Figure 1B). Our pre-
vious attempt to directly clone 14–200 nt RNA resulted in
93% (180/193) 5S/tRNA sequences. The sRNA-Seq
results therefore suggest that the 5S/tRNA depletion
step was successful in eliminating the majority of these
highly abundant transcripts.
Identification of candidateV. cholerae sRNAs
The 16 825 unique transcripts were mapped to the
V. cholerae genome and Figure 1B indicates the break-
down of all corresponding 407 039 reads, categorized by
the region of the genome from which they are derived.
Over one-fourth of the total reads correspond to anno-
tated open reading frames (ORFs). These transcripts
may represent the following: intact messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) corresponding to small proteins; unstable
degradation products from longer mRNAs; stable degra-
dation or processed products from longer mRNAs; or
functional non-coding transcripts whose promoters lie
within existing ORFs. To diﬀerentiate between these pos-
sibilities, and to generally enrich our data set for candi-
dates that may represent functional sRNAs, we ﬁltered the

these candidate reads; this includes the 20 sRNAs of known function and the 5 sRNAs predicted and veriﬁed by northern blot analysis (20,21).

data set and kept only those sequences that were observed
in two or more of the independent samples submitted for
454 sequencing. We reasoned that this would remove the
bulk of the transcripts that represented randomly derived
RNA degradation products. We considered any transcript
that passed these ﬁltering criteria, and did not represent
tRNA/rRNA or the intergenic sequences between tRNA/
rRNA, to be an sRNA candidate.
Post-ﬁltering, we identiﬁed 205 537 reads corresponding
to 2140 sRNA candidates (Figure 1E and Supplementary
Table 3). Importantly, of the sRNAs previously identiﬁed
and veriﬁed in V. cholerae, all 20 were observed to meet
our ﬁltering criteria (20,21). Figure 1C contains the break-
down of the post-ﬁlter reads. IGR transcripts are abun-
dant, representing 64% of the reads. IGRs represent 12%
of the V. cholerae genome, indicating that IGRs are highly
enriched for sRNAs over other regions of the genome.
Our data set also indicates that small transcripts derived
from the antisense strand of known ORFs or from within
annotated ORFs represent a signiﬁcant number of candi-
date non-coding RNAs. The candidates derived from
within ORFs may represent functional sRNAs or they
may encode small peptides (26). Together, these results
suggest that many sRNAs are derived from the sense
and antisense strands of ORFs, regions of the genome
excluded from most previous bioinformatic sRNA
screens.
Characterization of candidate sRNAs
Using our method of assigning putative transcripts by
grouping sequences that agreed within 10 bp at each
end, we observed 500 previously unidentiﬁed sRNAs tran-
scribed from IGRs (IGR-sRNAs) and 127 new sRNAs
transcribed from the antisense strand of annotated
ORFs (AS-sRNAs). The lengths of the ﬁnal set of candi-
date sRNAs ranged from 16–225 nt (Figure 1D). To verify
that these candidates indeed represent observable tran-
scripts in vivo, we selected several candidates from each
class of sRNA (IGR-, AS- and ORF-derived) to charac-
terize further (Table 2). For six out of seven randomly
chosen IGR-sRNA candidates, we were able to observe
by northern blot analysis a transcript of expected size
(Supplementary Figure 2). These results suggest that
many of the sRNA candidates are components of the
V. cholerae transcriptome. The northern blots also indi-
cated that some of the observed sRNAs are likely tran-
scribed as larger precursors (200–300 nt) that are
processed into smaller species. We hypothesize that the
200 nt cutoﬀ we used during the cloning process prevented
us from observing such larger precursors in our 454
dataset.
We next performed northern blot analyses for the
AS- and ORF- sRNA candidates. AS-sRNAs may pair
with their partner mRNA and be rapidly degraded (3),
thereby proving more diﬃcult to observe as a full-length
species. Nevertheless, northern blot analysis supported
the identiﬁcation of four out of nine randomly chosen
AS-sRNA candidates; in some cases, multiple transcripts
were observed by northern blot (AS5 and AS8)
(Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, ﬁve out of seven
candidate sRNAs transcribed from within an annotated
ORF (ORF-sRNA) were observed by northern blot ana-
lysis (Supplementary Figure 2). These results provide con-
ﬁrmation of these transcripts by means independent of the
sRNA-Seq method. The ORF-sRNA candidates queried
were chosen because they represented transcripts that were
>15-fold more abundant than any other sRNA transcripts
derived from the same ORF, in at least one of the
four sRNA-Seq samples (Supplementary Figure 3).
For comparison, the transcript abundance proﬁle for
14 V. cholerae sRNAs of known function are shown
in Supplementary Figure 4. Two of these ORF-sRNAs
(ORF2 and ORF7) are transcribed within ORFs that
are less that 500 bp long (VC2540, 393 bp; VC0957,
471 bp, respectively). These ORFs are annotated as encod-
ing hypothetical proteins; however, in our northern blots
we do not observe the full-length mRNA transcripts
(Supplementary Figure 2). It is possible that under the
conditions examined here, the mRNA is not expressed;
alternatively, our deep sequencing results may have
revealed regions of the genome that have been mis-
annotated as coding sequences.
The sRNA-Seq methodology also provides information
regarding the 50 and 30-ends of the sequenced transcripts
(Supplementary Table 3). To investigate whether sRNA-
Seq accurately maps the ends of sRNA transcripts,
we performed reverse transcription on total V. cholerae
RNA with speciﬁc primers for several candidate sRNAs.
For each of ﬁve candidates analyzed, a PCR product of
expected size was observed when the cDNA from the
reverse transcription reaction was ampliﬁed with forward
and reverse primers that annealed to regions within the
putative sRNA gene (Supplementary Figure 5). When
the forward primer was replaced with ones that annealed
20 or 50-nt upstream of the sequenced 50-end of the
sRNA, no PCR product was observed (Supplementary
Figure 5). These results further suggest that the informa-
tion provided by sRNA-Seq identiﬁes candidate sRNA
transcripts and accurately identiﬁes the 50-end of these
transcripts.
For all 16 candidate sRNAs conﬁrmed by northern
blotting, as well as the 20 known sRNAs, we visually
inspected their sequences and could ﬁnd no ribosome-
binding site with an appropriately spaced start codon.
The conservation of the candidate sRNA sequences was
also investigated. While some sRNAs, such as IGR7, were
highly conserved in other bacteria, particularly other
Vibrionaceae, several sRNAs (IGR4, IGR6) were not
identiﬁed in other bacteria by BLASTN analysis
(Table 2). In addition, we analyzed the candidate
sRNAs for nearby promoters and Rho-independent ter-
minators using BPROM and FindTerm software available
from Softberry (Mount Kisco, NY). For most candidate
sRNAs we were unable to identify putative promoters and
terminators using such prediction algorithms (Table 2).
Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that computa-
tional approaches for sRNA identiﬁcation that rely on
primary sequence conservation and/or on promoter and
Rho-independent terminator detection are likely eﬀective
in identifying only a small subset of non-coding transcripts.

sRNA candidate IGR7 is involved in carbon metabolism
Preliminary functional characterization was also per-
formed on one of the candidate sRNAs, IGR7 (Table 2
and Figure 2A). Northern blot analysis suggested that
this transcript is constitutively expressed as a 120-nt
transcript throughout V. cholerae growth in rich medium
(Figure 2B). This candidate sRNA is transcribed antisense
to the 50-untranslated region (UTR) of mtlA (VCA1045),
which encodes a transporter for mannitol, a naturally
occurring six-carbon sugar alcohol. Using the sRNA-Seq
data, we were able to map the 50 and 30-ends of IGR7; the
transcript begins ﬁve nucleotides upstream of the mtlA
start codon and ends 120-nt downstream after a series
of ﬁve Us. The sequencing data strongly suggests that
this 120-nt transcript is the predominant sRNA tran-
scribed from this region of the V. cholerae genome.
We reasoned that in V. cholerae IGR7 might be
involved in regulating the expression of this sugar trans-
porter and chose to investigate, quantitatively, the expres-
sion of IGR7 and mtlA in V. cholerae grown in diﬀerent
conditions. Similar to rich medium growth, in glucose
minimal medium, IGR7 is expressed at high levels and
mtlA mRNA levels are very low (Figure 3A).
Conversely, in mannitol minimal medium, mtlA mRNA
levels increase 20-fold and there is a reciprocal 20-fold
decrease in IGR7 expression (Figure 3A). Under these
conditions, the intracellular abundance of IGR7 had no
eﬀect on the expression of VCA1044, the gene upstream of

IGR7 and mtlA and which codes for a hypothetical pro-
tein (data not shown). When IGR7 was overexpressed in
trans from a plasmid, growth of V. cholerae was abrogated
in mannitol medium (Figure 3B, right panel). This eﬀect
was speciﬁc to growth on mannitol since overexpression of
IGR7 had no eﬀect on growth in glycerol medium
(Figure 3B, left panel). A knock-down of IGR7 through
overexpression of an antisense RNA, AS-IGR7, resulted
in a more rapid start of growth in mannitol medium
(Figure 3C, right panel), suggesting that the cells were
primed for growth in this carbon source. AS-IGR7 had
no aﬀect on bacterial growth in glycerol medium
(Figure 3C, left panel). Collectively, these observations
indicate that IGR7 is involved in the regulation of man-
nitol metabolism in V. cholerae likely through control of
mtlA expression. In addition, our results demonstrate that
sRNA-Seq was successful in identifying a functional and
previously unknown sRNA.
The sequence of IGR7 is highly conserved in all
Vibrionaceae, as well as in Photobacterium profundum
(Figure 4); in all these species, the sRNA gene is present
upstream of the mtlA homolog. In addition, the predicted
secondary structures of the IGR7-homologs in these other
species are all similar to the one shown in Figure 2A:
a long stem with one to two bulges and two stem-loops
(data not shown). Although E. coli has an mtlA homolog,
there was no homologous IGR7 sequence upstream of this
gene. We analyzed the E. coli transcriptome by northern
blot analysis and did not observe an sRNA transcribed
antisense to the 50-UTR of the mtlA gene (data not
shown). This observation suggests that Vibrio and
Photobacterium species may be unique in their use of an
sRNA to regulate mannitol metabolism.
DISCUSSION
Our understanding of non-coding RNAs and gene regu-
lation networks, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, has
grown exponentially in the past 20 years. Remarkable
advances in biotechnology in recent years have further
fueled our attempts to understand the complexity of gen-
omes and their programmed transcriptomes. Most studies
on sRNAs in prokaryotes have focused on the E. coli
transcriptome; collectively, 80 sRNAs have been identi-
ﬁed in this model organism. Bioinformatic analysis and
genetic screens have also led to the identiﬁcation of
sRNAs in many other bacteria, including V. cholerae.
Nevertheless, the ﬁndings we report here suggest that the
transcriptomes of bacteria remain ill-deﬁned and that the
number of sRNAs in bacteria has been greatly
underestimated.
Prior to this work, the use of direct cloning and mas-
sively parallel sequencing had been generally limited to
miRNAs that are much smaller than the abundant ‘house-
keeping’ RNAs, including tRNAs and rRNAs, or Poly(A)
mRNA. The 5S/tRNA depletion method we present here
should allow for more in-depth investigations of a variety
of small RNAs in a wide array of organisms. The sRNA-
Seq approach we developed in this work is readily appli-
cable to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic species and
we anticipate that improvements in parallel sequencing
technology will allow even more extensive and economical
explorations of transcriptomes to be performed. The 5S/
tRNA depletion step, moreover, can be extended to the
removal of any RNA of known sequence based on the
principle of separating the unwanted RNA from the nec-
essary 30 linker. For example, future eﬀorts may include
removal of additional housekeeping sRNAs such as the
4.5S and 6S RNAs. Additional studies to further improve
upon this new depletion technique are currently under-
way. In addition, it should be possible to precede the
sRNA-Seq direct cloning protocol with treatment of
total RNA with commercial kits for the removal of the
16S and 23S rRNAs; the resulting cDNA libraries could
be used for general transcriptome analyses.
Our sRNA-Seq results suggest that while most sRNAs
are indeed expressed from intergenic sequences, a signiﬁ-
cant portion of bacterial sRNAs is derived from protein-
encoding regions of bacterial genomes, regions excluded
from nearly all previous computational screens for sRNA-
encoding loci. Through northern blot analysis, we were
able to conﬁrm the expression of most sRNA candidates
queried. In addition, our investigations into the function
of these sRNAs led to the discovery of a novel regulator of
carbon metabolism in V. cholerae. This sRNA, IGR7, is

abundant during growth in rich medium and appears
to negatively regulate a partially overlapping mRNA
encoding a mannitol transporter. The sequencing data
also allowed us to map the 50- and 30-ends of IGR7
and other candidate sRNAs. Collectively, these results
suggest that sRNA-Seq studies can complement existing
techniques used to identify sRNAs. We anticipate that
sRNA-Seq can also be used to analyze changes in tran-
scriptomes as bacteria are subjected to diﬀerent growth
conditions. Since sRNA-mediated regulation plays a cen-
tral role in a myriad of biological processes, the compre-
hensive and unbiased proﬁles of sRNA repertoires
aﬀorded by sRNA-Seq will likely yield important insights
that will advance our understanding of gene regulation
networks.
