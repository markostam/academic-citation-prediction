Abstract—Recent studies highlight the existence of an autonomous nuclear lipid metabolism related to cellular
proliferation. However, the importance of nuclear phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism is poorly understood.
Therefore, we were interested in nuclear PCs as a source of second messengers and, particularly, nuclear phospholipase
D (PLD) identification in membrane-free nuclei isolated from pig aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Using
immunoblot experiment, in vitro PLD assay with fluorescent substrate and confocal microscopy analysis, we
demonstrated that only PLD1 is expressed in VSMC nucleus, whereas PLD1 and PLD2 are present in VSMC. Inhibition
of RhoA and protein kinase C (PKC) by C3-exoenzyme and PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor, respectively, conducted
a decrease of phosphatidylethanol production. On the other hand, treatment of intact VSMCs, but not nuclei, with
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors prevented partially nuclear PLD1 activity, indicating for the first time that
PI3K may have a role in nuclear PLD regulation. In addition, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or angiotensin II treatment
of VSMCs resulted in an increase of intranuclear PLD activity, whereas platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal
growth factor have no significant effect. Moreover, pertussis toxin induced a decrease of LPA-stimulated nuclear PLD1
activity, suggesting that heterotrimeric Gi/G0 protein involvement in intranuclear PLD1 regulation. We also show that
LPA-induced nuclear PLD1 activation implied PI3K/PKC pathway activation and PKC nuclear translocation as well
as nuclear RhoA activation. Thus, the characterization of an endogenous PLD1 that could regulate PC metabolism inside
VSMC nucleus provides a new role for this enzyme in control of vascular fibroproliferative disorders. (Circ Res.
2006;99:132-139.)

Atherosclerotic plaques typically consist of a lipid-richcore covered by a fibrous cap that arises from the
migration and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs) and from matrix deposition. The balance
between VSMCs and inflammatory cells has recently been
emphasized as a strong determinant of plaque rupture. In
stable plaques, a thick cap consisting of VSMCs and extra-
cellular matrix covers the entire lipid core. These lesions are
clinically silent, and they rarely rupture. By contrast, fibrous
cap in unstable plaques is thin, especially at the shoulder
lesion, and contains few VSMCs but numerous inflammatory
cells. These plaques are prone to rupture, leading to throm-
bosis followed by either occlusion or by episodic plaque
expansion. Moreover, the treatment of occlusive atheroscle-
rotic lesions by percutaneous balloon angioplasty, transplant
vasculopathy, and vein bypass graft failure leads to restenosis
involving VSMC proliferation as the primary pathophysio-
logical mechanism. Thus, the understanding of signaling
pathways leading to VSMC migration and proliferation is
important to prevent these pathologies.1,2
It is now becoming clear that the activation of phospho-
lipase D (PLD) is a major component of signal-transduction
cascades and that many of the external agents that promote
proliferation and migration of VSMCs activate PLD.3,4 In
mammalian cells, PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of the prin-
cipal membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC), producing
phosphatidic acid (PA), and choline. PA can be metabolized
to diacylglycerol (DAG) by PA phosphohydrolase or to
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by phospholipase A2. Although
the physiological role of PLDs remains unclear, multiple
functions have been proposed based on their involvement in
signaling pathway and on the roles of PA and its derivatives
DAG or LPA in a wide range of cellular functions, including
vesicle trafficking, inflammatory and immune response, cel-

lular proliferation, and apoptosis.5,6 To date, 2 PLD genes,
PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned and characterized,7 and 2
splice variants of each isoform have been identified.8 PLD1
has a low basal activity and is upregulated by small GTP-
binding proteins (Rho, Ral, and ARF), protein kinase C (PKC)
and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) in
vitro. In contrast, PLD2 has a high basal activity, requires
PtdIns(4,5)P2, and is upregulated by ARF and PKC.6,9
Over the past 10 years, evidence has accumulated high-
lighting that an internal nuclear lipid metabolism, especially
the inositol lipid metabolism, is regulated independently from
that of the plasma membrane.10 Thus, we identified a phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase  (PI3K) and the two 3-phosphoino-
sitide phosphatases SHIP-2 and PTEN in VSMC membrane-
free nuclei, suggesting an intranuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 cycle
in VSMCs.11,12 However, the importance of other nuclear
lipids, in particular PC, is poorly understood. PC has been
found associated with the nuclear envelope, the chromatin,
and nuclear matrix.13,14 Moreover, studies from several lab-
oratories demonstrated the presence of a PLD activity asso-
ciated with nuclei. G protein– dependent and oleate-
dependent PLD activities have been identified in intact nuclei
from MDCK cells,15 IIC9 fibroblasts,16 rat liver and hepa-
toma cells,17,18 and LA-N-1 neuroblastoma cells.19,20 The
nuclear RhoA- and ARF-activated PLD was suggested to
reside in the nuclear envelope.16,18 Furthermore, immunohis-
tochemical analyses indicated that PLD1 localizes to nuclear
membranes in pituitary GH3 cells21 and that an intranuclear
PLD2 is expressed in human renal cancer cells.22 In addition,
a 90-kDa PLD, distinct from PLD1 or PLD2, was identified
in nuclei of human leukemia HL-60 cells.23 Thus, these
studies reported PLD activities in the nucleus of some
mammalian cells, but the isoforms responsible and their
activation have yet to be established. Therefore, we investi-
gated whether an active PLD is localized inside membrane-
free nuclei isolated from pig aorta VSMC.
Our results show that VSMC membrane-depleted nuclei
only contain an endogenous active PLD1 regulated by the
small G protein RhoA and by PKC, whereas VSMC possess
both PLD1 and PLD2. Moreover, the present study demon-
strates for the first time that a nuclear PLD was regulated by
PI3K and was specifically stimulated by heterotrimeric G
protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) but not by receptor ty-
rosine kinases (RTK). Thus, these observations suggest that
an intranuclear PLD1 activity might regulate specific signal-
ing pathways involved in vascular proliferative disorders.

growth factor (EGF), Ro-31-8220, Go 6976, and PKC pseudosub-
strate inhibitor (PS-PKC) (Calbiochem); platelet-derived growth

clonal anti-PLD1 (gift from S. Bourgoin)24; specific polyclonal
antibodies for RhoA (sc-179) and RhoB (sc-180), polyclonal anti-
p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), polyclonal anti-
PKC, and monoclonal anti–lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc); monoclonal anti–phospho-p42/p44 MAPK and horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit (Promega); horseradish peroxida-

anti–tubulin  and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-
conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma).
Cell culture reagents were from Gibco. Enhanced chemilumines-
cence (ECL) system was from Amersham Biosciences.
Cell Culture and Isolation of VSMC Nuclei
VSMCs were prepared from 6-week-old pig (INRA, Toulouse,
France) thoracic aorta using an explant technique and cultured as
previously described.11 For experiments, VSMCs at 80% confluence
from passages 2 to 5 were used. All animal care and procedures were
in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Highly purified VSMC nuclei stripped of their nuclear envelope
were obtained according to the method described previously.11 Our
isolation procedure yields nuclei of high purity and stripped of their
nuclear envelope as observed by electron microscopic analysis, by
Western blot analysis of cytoskeleton protein (tubulin) and nuclear
pore protein (nucleoporin, laminin A/C), and by determining marker
enzymes for cytoplasm (lactate dehydrogenase) and plasma mem-
brane (5-nucleotidase).11,12 An average of 0.5106 nuclei were
obtained from 1106 cells (1106 cells and 1106 nuclei contained
300 g and 30 g of proteins, respectively).
Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting
Proteins from whole cells or purified nuclei were separated by
SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &
Schuell), and immunoblotted as described previously.12 Immunode-
tection was achieved using the relevant primary antibody, anti-
PLD1/2 (1:500), anti-PLD1 (1:2000), anti-RhoA (1:500), anti-RhoB
(1:500), anti-PKC (1:500), anti–tubulin  (1:1000), and anti–lamin
A/C (1:250) overnight at 4°C or anti–extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (anti-ERK) (1:1000), and anti-phospho-ERK (1:10000) 1
hour at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies (anti-mouse, 1:5000; anti-rabbit, 1:10000) were
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and immunoreactive
proteins were visualized with ECL reagents according to the instruc-
tions of the manufacturer.
Immunochemistry
Growing VSMCs were cultured at low confluence on glass cover-
slips, fixed, and permeabilized as described.12 After 3 washes in
PBS, cells were blocked with 1% BSA for 30 minutes, followed by
incubation with the primary antibody anti-PLD1 (1/1000) in 0.05%
saponin and 0.1% BSA, overnight at 4°C. After washing, coverslips
were incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:200) for 1
hour at room temperature, mounted in Mowiol, and examined by
confocal scanning laser immunofluorescence microscopy using a
LSM510 ZEISS microscope.
PLD Activity Assay
PLD activity was assessed by measuring accumulation of the
unambiguous PLD activity marker phosphatidylethanol (PEt) that is
generated in the presence of ethanol (EtOH) by transphosphatidyla-
tion reaction. Purified nuclei were incubated 1 hour at 37°C in PBS
buffer with 1.17 mol/L Bodipy-PC as a PLD substrate, 0.1%
DMSO with or without 1% EtOH to measure PEt production. All
assays were conducted in a final volume of 1 mL. Total lipids were
immediately extracted with 1 mL of butanol-1 and separation of
Bodipy-PC–derived products was realized according to procedure
described by Kemken et al.25
For experiments in the presence of PLD regulators, nuclei were
preincubated with oleic acid (from 25 to 200 mol/L) or
PtdIns(4,5)P2 (2.5 mol/L) for 15 minutes at 37°C before adding
EtOH. For experiments in which C3-exoenzyme was used, nuclei
were treated with the indicated concentrations of C3-exoenzyme for

15 minutes at 37°C in a buffer consisting of 100 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L thymidine, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol
(DTT), 10 mol/L nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Ex-
periments with PKC inhibitors, Ro-31-8220, Go 6976, and PS-
PKC, or with PI3K inhibitors, LY-294002 and wortmannin, were
conducted as detailed in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. For PLD
activity following cell activation with agonists, VSMCs were previ-
ously incubated in fresh serum-depleted medium for 48 hours, then
stimulated with LPA (10 mol/L), angiotensin II (100 nmol/L),
PDGF (10 mol/L), or EGF (10 mol/L) for 5 minutes to 120
minutes, at 37°C.

Results
VSMC Membrane-Free Nuclei Contain
PLD Activity
Recent studies have reported that apart from the lipids present
in the nuclear envelope, the nucleus also contains lipids
located further inside, and evidence is being accumulated on
the importance of internal nuclear lipid metabolism in cellular
signaling. Therefore, we first investigated whether VSMC
membrane-free nuclei contained PLD activity able to hydro-
lyze PC to produce second messengers.
PLD activity was assessed by measuring its transphos-
phatidylation product, PEt. Thus, VSMC nuclei were incu-
bated with the fluorescent substrate Bodipy-PC in absence
(Figure 1, top) or presence (Figure 1, bottom) of EtOH, and
the products were then analyzed by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). As shown in Figure 1, the presence
of EtOH induced the formation of PEt and a concomitant
decrease of PA production, indicating a nuclear PLD activity.
Moreover, both HPLC profiles revealed 2 additional peaks
corresponding to diglyceride (DG), and LysoPC suggesting
that various enzymes are able to degrade PC inside VSMC
nuclei. Indeed, DG production may be the consequence of
PC–phospholipase C (PC-PLC) activity and/or the conse-
quence of the sequential action of PLD and phosphatidate
phosphohydrolase, whereas lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)
could result from PLA2 activity. These data indicate an active
intranuclear PC catabolism and reveal the presence of a PLD
activity inside VSMC nuclei.
PLD1, but Not PLD2, Is Expressed in
VSMC Nuclei
To determine which type of PLD was expressed in VSMC
nuclei, we performed immunoblot experiments using an
antibody that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 (Figure 2A).
We loaded the same amount of proteins from cell homoge-
nates and from membrane-free nuclei. In total cell homoge-
nate, we detected 116- and 96-kDa proteins corresponding to
Figure 1. Nuclear PLD activity in VSMCs. PLD activity was
assayed as detailed under Materials and Methods. Nuclei
(2106) were incubated 1 hour with 0.1% DMSO without (top)
or with (bottom) 1% EtOH and with 1.1 mol/L Bodipy-PC. Lip-
ids were extracted, and fluorescent Bodipy-PEt was analyzed
by HPLC. DG, PA, and PEt formation were quantified using a
standard curve obtained with various concentration of BODIPY-
PC. The data are the meanSE from 3 independent
experiments.

the molecular mass reported for PLD1 and PLD2, respec-
tively. By contrast, only a single band at 116 kDa was
observed in nuclear fraction, suggesting that only PLD1 was
expressed in nuclear compartment. To confirm the nuclear
localization of PLD1, growing VSMCs were stained with
specific anti-PLD1 antibody21,24 and analyzed by confocal
scanning laser microscopy (Figure 2B). In agreement with
immunoblot studies, PLD1 was found both in nuclei and
cytosol. No red labeling was observed when the primary
antibody was omitted (data not shown).
Additional experiments were undertaken to confirm the
presence of PLD1 inside VSMC nuclei. In fact, PLD1 and
PLD2 are activated by PtdIns(4,5)P2, but PLD1 is inhibited,
whereas PLD2 is activated by oleic acid in vitro.6,9 Thus,
purified VSMC nuclei were incubated with Bodipy-PC,
EtOH, and either PtdIns(4,5)P2 (2.5 mol/L) (Figure 2C) or
increasing concentrations of oleic acid (Figure 2D). Our
results show that PtdIns(4,5)P2 treatment increased PEt pro-
duction (350%, P0.001, n3), whereas oleic acid treat-
ment decreased intranuclear PLD activity in a dose-dependent
manner: inhibition was 40% with 50 mol/L oleic acid and
nearly 100% with 200 mol/L oleic acid. Taken together, these
results indicate that both isoforms are present in VSMCs, but
only PLD1 is expressed and active in VSMC nucleus.
RhoA and PKC Regulate Intranuclear
PLD1 Activity
There is now strong evidence that PLD1 is specifically
regulated by monomeric G protein of Rho family and PKC.6,9
However, PLD1 regulation in nucleus remains largely unde-
fined. To address this question, we first investigated the
expression of RhoA and RhoB within VSMCs and
membrane-depleted nuclei. We used specific polyclonal anti-
RhoA (Figure 3A) or anti-RhoB (Figure 3B) antibodies and
loaded the same amount of protein from cell homogenate and
nuclei. Western blot analysis showed that RhoA and RhoB
were present in VSMC, whereas only RhoA was expressed in
nuclear compartment. To assess the role of RhoA on PLD1
activity, VSMC nuclei were pretreated with C botulinum
C3-exoenzyme, an ADP-ribosyl transferase that blocks the
activity of small G proteins of the Rho family.26 Figure 3C
shows that PEt production dramatically decreased (83%
inhibition, P0.01, n3) in the presence of the bacterial
toxin (25 g/mL), indicating that RhoA regulates intranuclear
PLD1 activity.
To test a possible role of PKC in nuclear PLD1 activity,
nuclei were pretreated with Ro-31-8220 (0.1 to 10 mol/L),
a broad-range inhibitor of PKC. Figure 4A shows that
Ro-31-8220 inhibited PEt production in a dose-dependent
manner. A significant inhibition (47.5% inhibition, P0.001,
n4) was observed in presence of 1 mol/L Ro-31-8220. To
further evaluate the involvement of classical and/or atypical
PKC, nuclei were pretreated for 15 minutes with Go 6976, a
selective inhibitor for classical PKC and - (Figure 4B), or
with PS-PKC, a selective inhibitor of PKC (Figure 4C). We
observed that Go 6976 did not modify PLD activity signifi-
cantly, whereas PS-PKC inhibited PEt production in a
dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that RhoA and
PKC regulate intranuclear PLD1 activity.

from 5104 VSMCs and 5105 nuclei were fractionated on 15%

Cellular PI3K Regulates Intranuclear
PLD1 Activity
It has been reported that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can stimulate PLD
activity.27 As we have previously identified an active PI3K in
VSMC nuclei,11 we tested whether specific PI3K inhibitor
modified nuclear PLD activity. Thus, we preincubated
membrane-free nuclei with LY-294002 (0 to 10 mol/L), at
4°C for 15 to 60 minutes, or at 37°C for 15 or 30 minutes. In
these conditions, we never observed a significant inhibition of
PEt production, whereas the treatment of VSMC nuclei with
10 mol/L LY-294002 for 15 minutes at 4°C reduced nuclear
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production by 80%11 (data not shown). To
study the possible involvement of cytosolic PI3K on nuclear
PLD1 activity, VSMCs were pretreated with wortmannin
(100 nmol/L) for different times, at 37°C. Figure 5A shows a
significant inhibition of nuclear PLD1 after a 30 minute
exposure to wortmannin. Moreover, VSMCs treatment with
LY-294002 (0 to 15 mol/L) (Figure 5B) or wortmannin (0
to 100 nmol/L) (Figure 5C) for 4 hours, inhibited PEt
production in a concentration-dependent manner, with a
maximal effect (60% inhibition) at 10 mol/L and 100
nmol/L, respectively. These results show for the first time
that PI3K-dependent signaling is implicated in nuclear PLD1
activity and suggest that cytosolic PI3K is important for this
activity.
GPCR Agonists Specifically Stimulate
PLD1 Activity
Several studies have shown that cytosolic PLD is activated in
VSMCs via different classes of cell-surface receptor includ-
ing RTK and GPCR.6 However, the specific role of RTK and
GPCR agonists on nuclear PLD activity remains unclear.
Therefore, we investigated whether PDGF and LPA, RTK
and GPCR agonists, respectively, could activate intranuclear
PLD1 (Figure 6).
Quiescent VSMCs were stimulated by LPA (10 mol/L) or
PDGF (10 mol/L) for different times, then nuclei were
isolated, and PLD activity was estimated after HPLC analy-
sis. As shown in Figure 6A, LPA activated nuclear PLD in a
time-dependent manner and mediated a maximal increase in
PEt production at 1 hour of exposure (110%, P0.001,
n3). In contrast, PDGF did not stimulate intranuclear PLD1
activity (Figure 6B). These results suggest that GPCR ago-
nists, but not RTK agonists, stimulate intranuclear PLD
activity. To examine this hypothesis, the same experiment
was performed in presence of various agonists. Thus, intact
VSMCs were stimulated for 1 hour with 10 mol/L LPA, 100
nmol/L angiotensin II, 10 mol/L PDGF, or 10 mol/L EGF.
As shown in Figure 6C, the GPCR agonist angiotensin II also
stimulated PLD1 activity, with a lower level of PEt produc-
tion as compared with LPA (67%, P0.05, n3). EGF,
like PDGF, had no significant effect on nuclear PLD1
activity, although these RTK agonists induced signal trans-
duction cascade and activated p42/44 MAPK, as shown by
Figure 5. PI3K regulates intranuclear PLD1 activity. Growing
VSMCs were incubated with wortmannin (100 nmol/L) for differ-
ent times (A) or with LY-294002 (0 to 15 mol/L) (B) and wort-
mannin (0 to 100 nmol/L) (C) 4 hours at 37°C. Nuclei were puri-
fied and PLD activity was measured on 2106 nuclei as
described in Materials and Methods. Results are given as

demonstrate for the first time a selective activation of a
nuclear PLD isoform by signaling cascade downstream
GPCR.
LPA-Induced Activation of Nuclear PLD1
We next investigated the mechanism by which LPA could
stimulate the nuclear PLD1 activity. LPA activates 3 distinct
GPCRs (LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3). LPA1 and LPA2 interact
with Gi/0, Gq, and G12/13 proteins, whereas LPA3 combines with
Gi/0 and Gq proteins.28 Thus, quiescent VSMCs were incu-
bated with PTX (100 ng/mL) for 16 hours. Then, nuclei were
isolated and PLD1 activity was estimated. Figure 7A shows
that PTX reduced PLD1 activity by 55% below the basal
activity (P0.001, n3), suggesting that heterotrimeric Gi/0
protein is implicated in both LPA-induced nuclear PLD1
activity and basal activity. Moreover, to assess the involve-
ment of cytosolic PI3K in nuclear PLD1 activation, quiescent
VSMCs were pretreated with LY-294002 or wortmannin for
3 hours before stimulation with LPA. We observed that the
PI3K inhibitors induced a decrease in LPA-stimulated nu-
clear PLD1 activity by 60% below the basal activity
(Figure 7B). To further establish the contribution of nuclear
RhoA and PKC to PLD1 activation, nuclei isolated from
LPA-stimulated VSMCs were treated with C3-exoenzyme or
PS-PKC (Figure 7B). C3-exoenzyme blocked LPA-induced
nuclear PLD1 activity, whereas PS-PKC reduced PLD1
activity to the same extent as the PI3K inhibitors (60%
below the basal activity). Also, the inhibition of LPA-induced
PEt production by the addition of both PI3K inhibitor
(LY-294002 or wortmannin) and PS-PKC was not signifi-
cantly different from that obtained by each inhibitor (Figure
7B), indicating that PI3K could regulate nuclear PLD1
activity via PKC.
We next investigated whether LPA induced the nuclear
translocation of PLD1, PKC, and RhoA by using Western
blot analysis (Figure 7C). We did not observe significant
translocation of both PLD1 and Rho-A, although the expres-
sion of these enzymes was always higher in nuclei isolated
from LPA-treated VSMCs than in nuclei from control cells.
In contrast, LPA induced an increase of nuclear PKC
expression by 10937%. The nuclear translocation of PKC
was inhibited when VSMCs were treated with the PI3K
inhibitors LY-294002 or wortmannin, whereas PLD1 and
RhoA translocation were not significantly modified (Figure
7C). Thus, the LPA-promoted nuclear translocation of PKC
is dependent on PI3K.
Discussion
The present work clearly demonstrates the presence of an
endogenous active PLD1 inside VSMC nuclei isolated from
pig aorta, whereas PLD1 and PLD2 have been identified in
VSMC lysate. Although previous work has reported PLD
enzyme activity in cell nuclei,5 the isoform responsible was
not characterized. Moreover, in most studies, nuclear PLD
has been identified only indirectly through overexpression of
enzyme that could lead to a distribution of the PLD signifi-

cantly different from endogenous enzyme.21 In this study,
intranuclear localization of PLD1 was determined by cell
fractionation and also by immunofluorescence using highly
sensitive antibodies to PLD1.21,24 As an additional control, we
showed that nuclear PLD activity is inhibited by oleic acid in
a concentration-dependent manner. This result confirmed the
presence of PLD1 inside VSMC nucleus, as PLD2 is stimu-
lated by oleic acid.29
PLD1 is activated in vitro by small GTPases of Arf and
Rho families and by direct interaction with PKC.9 Arf-
dependant18 and Rho-dependant16 PLD activities have been
identified in nuclear envelope of liver and hepatocytes18 and
IIC9 fibroblasts,16 respectively. Our data demonstrate that
RhoA is expressed in membrane-free VSMC nuclei, and it
could be a dominant activator of nuclear PLD1 because
C3-exoenzyme inhibited more than 80% of its activity.
However, we cannot exclude a role for Arf in PLD activity,
although we were unable to identify Arf protein inside pig
VSMC nucleus by immunoblot experiments with antibodies
used (data not shown).
We also observed that direct treatment of nuclei with the
selective inhibitor for classical PKC and -, Go 6976, did
not modify PLD1 activity, whereas the selective inhibitor of
PKC, PS-PKC, induced a dramatic decrease in nuclear
PLD1 activity. In a range of cells and tissues, PKC 30,31 and
PKC30 regulate PLD1 activity. However, a critical role for
PKC in PLD activation induced by norepinephrine in rabbit
VSMC32 or by IA-adrenergic receptor agonist in Rat-1
fibroblasts has been recently demonstrated,33 but the PLD
isoform responsible was not determined. All PKC isoforms,
except the conventional PKC and the novel PKC, are
expressed in human aortic VSMCs.34 Thus, in VSMC nuclei,
PKC is required for nuclear PLD1 activity. However, it is
possible that cytosolic PLD1 is regulated by other PKC
isoform(s) in these cells.
An interesting finding in the present study was the obser-
vation that angiotensin II and LPA induced nuclear PLD1
activation, whereas PDGF and EGF had no significant effect
on this activity. Our results show that nuclear PLD1 activa-
tion by LPA involves heterotrimeric Gi/G0 proteins, PKC,
and RhoA. Moreover, we present the first evidence for the
involvement of PI3K in nuclear PLD1 activity. Very recently,
Stahelin et al35 demonstrated that PLD1 PX domain binds
PdtIns(3,4,5)P3 with high specificity and affinity and that this
binding could be an important factor in spatiotemporal
regulation and activation of PLD1. However, a direct inter-
action between nuclear PdtIns(3,4,5)P3 and PLD1 seems
unlikely because our data showed that the pretreatment of
nuclear fraction with PI3K inhibitors had no effect on nuclear
PLD1 activity. On the other hand, VSMC treatment by the
PI3K inhibitors LY-294002 or wortmannin inhibited LPA-
induced nuclear PLD1 activity to the same extent as PS-
PKC, suggesting that PI3K could regulate nuclear PLD1
activity via PKC. Indeed, our results showed that the
inhibition of LPA-induced nuclear PLD1 activity obtained
with both PS-PKC and PI3K inhibitor or with each of
inhibitor was very similar and that LPA-induced PKC
translocation into nucleus is inhibited by LY-294002 or
wortmannin. Thus, in LPA-stimulated VSMCs, the nucleo-
cytoplasmic shuttling of PKC is dependent on cytosolic
PI3K. However, in nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated
PC-12 cells36 and in ceramide-treated hepatocytes,37 nuclear
increase in PI3K activity and PdtIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis seems
necessary for the subsequent nuclear translocation of PKC.
These discrepancies might be attributable to differences in
cell type and/or agonist-activated signaling pathway.
Furthermore, RhoA appears to regulate only LPA-induced
nuclear PLD1 activity, whereas PKC regulates both basal
and LPA-induced nuclear PLD1 activity, suggesting that
RhoA and PKC could activate nuclear PLD1 via different
pathways. Figure 8 summarizes the different pathways for
nuclear PLD1 activation by LPA based on the data presented
here.
Interestingly, our finding that nuclear PLD1 is selectively
activated by GPCR, but not by RTK, is in favor of a very
specific role of nuclear phospholipids mediators generated by
this enzyme, suggesting an emerging role of nuclear local-
ization in PLD1 functions and, more importantly, in patho-
logical processes as hypertension and atherosclerosis that
involve differentiation and hyperplasia of VSMCs.

Figure 8. The proposed pathway of LPA-induced intranuclear
PLD1 activation. Nuclear PLD1 is selectively activated by GPCR
agonists like LPA but not by RTK agonists such as EGF or
PDGF. LPA stimulates nuclear PLD1 via heterotrimeric Gi/G0
protein and PI3K (probably PI3K, known to be activated by
GPCR). LPA activates PI3K/PKC pathway and induces nuclear
translocation of PKC. Nuclear RhoA is also involved in nuclear
PLD activation, probably by a pathway independent of PI3K/
PKC. The dashed arrows indicate unknown mechanism.
