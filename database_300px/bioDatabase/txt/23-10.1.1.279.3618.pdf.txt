ABSTRACT
Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are an emerging
class of regulators of bacterial gene expression.
Most of the regulatory Escherichia coli sRNAs
known to date modulate translation of trans-
encoded target mRNAs. We studied the specificity
of sRNA target interactions using gene fusions to
green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a novel reporter
of translational control by bacterial sRNAs in vivo.
Target sequences were selected from both mono-
cistronic and polycistronic mRNAs. Upon expres-
sion of the cognate sRNA (DsrA, GcvB, MicA, MicC,
MicF, RprA, RyhB, SgrS and Spot42), we observed
highly specific translation repression/activation of
target fusions under various growth conditions.
Target regulation was also tested in mutants that
lacked Hfq or RNase III, or which expressed a trun-
cated RNase E (rne701). We found that translational
regulation by these sRNAs was largely independent
of full-length RNase E, e.g. despite the fact that
ompA fusion mRNA decay could no longer be pro-
moted by MicA. This is the first study in which
multiple well-defined E.coli sRNA target pairs have
been studied in a uniform manner in vivo. We expect
our GFP fusion approach to be applicable to sRNA
targets of other bacteria, and also demonstrate that
Vibrio RyhB sRNA represses a Vibrio sodB fusion
when co-expressed in E.coli.
INTRODUCTION
Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that act as regulators of
gene expression are wide-spread in bacteria. Typically, these
molecules are 50–200 nt in size, and do not contain expressed
open reading frames (ORFs). Using a diverse array of
approaches [reviewed in (1)], >70 Escherichia coli sRNAs
have been identified in numerous screens [e.g. (2–7)] over
the past five years, while hundreds of additional sRNA
candidate genes still await experimental validation (8).
Two main modes of action have been established for the
E.coli sRNAs. Some sRNAs modify the activity of proteins
(9–11), while the majority act on trans-encoded target
mRNAs to modulate their translation and/or stability. Several
key features of antisense regulation by chromosomal sRNAs
have emerged: (i) Unlike the cis-encoded antisense RNAs of
plasmids and phages [reviewed in (12)], these trans-encoded
antisense RNAs typically have only short and imperfect com-
plementarity to their target(s). (ii) Base pairing most often
occurs in the 50-untranslated region (50-UTR) of the target
mRNA, and is aided by the bacterial Sm-like protein, Hfq.
(iii) Binding may result in either the blockage of ribosome
entry (translational repression), or the melting of inhibitory
secondary structures, which sequester the ribosome binding
site (RBS) of the mRNA (translational activation). (iv) Regu-
lation is frequently coupled to nuclease-mediated cleavage of
the mRNA, e.g. RNase E cleavage of sodB mRNA upon
RyhB binding (13), and RNase III cleavage of tisAB
mRNA upon IstR-1 binding (14).
Several E.coli sRNA target interactions have been well-
defined. For example, the porin-regulating sRNAs, MicC
and MicF, form an extended though imperfect RNA duplex
with the 50-UTRs of the ompC and ompF mRNAs, respec-
tively (15,16), whereas MicA forms an almost perfect
16 bp duplex encompassing the RBS region of ompA
mRNA (17,18). Shorter interactions underlie the repression
of the ptsG message by SgrS (19), and of the sodB message
by RyhB (20); in the latter case, 9 nt of either RNA are
involved in duplex formation (21). Repression of the fhlA
mRNA by OxyS is mediated by two short kissing complexes
of 9 and 7 bp, respectively; the two target regions in OxyS
and in fhlA mRNA are each separated by long spacers (22).
DsrA was proposed to repress hns mRNA by binding it at
both the start and the stop codon region; in other words,
a bipartite interaction that would involve regions within the
hns mRNA that are 400 nt apart (23).
Some sRNAs are known to activate translation of mRNAs.
The DsrA and RprA sRNAs pair with the rpoS mRNA leader,
thereby preventing the formation of an inhibitory structure
around the rpoS RBS that would otherwise repress rpoS trans-
lation (24–26). There are two other examples of E.coli
sRNAs that function as mRNA activators, i.e. GadY and
RydC (27,28).
In the early days of E.coli sRNA identification, these
molecules were frequently recognized through their effect
on a certain mRNA. For example, the micF gene was found

within a multi-copy library insert that caused OmpF deple-
tion, while the MicF/ompF mRNA interaction was shown
in subsequent analysis (15,29). That is a (main) target was
known before the regulator itself was identified. In contrast,
the sheer numbers of new sRNAs recently identified in
systematic genome-wide searches (1), which are a priori of
unknown function, require tools to efficiently predict and
study interactions with target mRNAs. Besides, since
sRNAs may also regulate multiple targets [e.g. (26,30,31)],
knowing a single target may not fully reflect the regulatory
potential of a given sRNA.
Traditionally, genome-wide screens of randomly inserted
reporter gene fusions as well as global protein pattern
changes upon deletion or overexpression of an sRNA have
played a major role in target identification [e.g. (17,18,32)].
However, these approaches strictly require the target gene
to be expressed at a measurable level under the assay condi-
tion, with the additional caveat that they provide little means
to distinguish primary target effects from secondary pleiotro-
pic changes of gene expression. Recently, several approaches
were taken to narrow target searches to those mRNAs that
directly interact with a given sRNA, e.g. monitoring mRNA
decay on microarrays following sRNA overexpression
(30,33,34), selective capture of cellular mRNAs with in
vitro-synthesized sRNAs (28,35), and biocomputational
target predictions (30).
Regardless of the route taken for identification, the in vivo
assessment of putative target regulation remains a critical
issue. Of the various reporters of bacterial gene expression
(16,36), chromosomal or plasmid-borne translational fusions
of the target 50-UTR to E.coli lacZ, encoding b-galactosidase,
have been the most common tool to study target gene regula-
tion by sRNAs. However, since the fusion is typically driven
by the target gene promoter, a specific effect on translation
rather than on transcription has to be confirmed in indepen-
dent experiments. Generally, lacZ fusions represent a robust
and well-established reporter system, however, come with
the disadvantages of an enzymatic assay involving cell lysis
to measure b-galactosidase activity.
Using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jelly-
fish Aequorea victoria (37), which permits a non-invasive
reporter assay, we have here studied a great number of
E.coli sRNAs and their targets in a uniform reporter system.
This study has revealed novel aspects of regulation for sev-
eral of these pairs. Furthermore, our GFP-based reporters
will be helpful to rapidly validate bacterial sRNA targets of
other prokaryotes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA oligonucleotides
The complete list of oligonucleotides used for cloning and as
probes in hybridization is provided as Supplementary Table S2.
Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions
E.coli strain Top10 (Invitrogen) was used to clone GFP
fusions, and in all experiments that involved co-expression
of GFP fusions and sRNAs. E.coli strain Top10 F0 (Invitro-
gen) was used to clone sRNA expression plasmids. All
established mutant strains are derived from E.coli Top10.
Strains JVS-2001 (Dhfq::KmR) and JVS-2002 (rne701-KmR)
were constructed by the one-step inactivation protocol (38)
with PCR products obtained with primer pairs JVO-0515/-
0516 or JVO-0856/-0857, respectively, using a modified
KmR cassette of plasmid pKD4 as template (J. Vogel,
unpublished data). Strain JVS-2003 (Drnc14::TetR) was con-
structed similarly, using primer pair JVO-0884/-0885 and
chromosomal DNA of strain W3310 rnc14::Tn10 (39). Verifi-
cation of the mutant strains was carried out by colony
PCR using primer pairs JVO-0517/-0518 (for JVS-2001),
JVO-0858/-0859 (for JVS-2002) and JVO-0886/-0887 (for
JVS-2003). C-terminal truncation of RNase E in JVS-2002
was also verified by western blot using an RNase E antiserum
(kindly provided by A. G. Carpousis). Details of the aforemen-
tioned bacterial strains are given in Supplementary Table S1.
Growth in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth or on LB plates at
37C was used throughout this study. Antibiotics were
applied at the following concentrations: 100 mg/ml ampi-
cillin, 50 mg/ml kanamycin and 20 mg/ml chloramphenicol.
Plasmids
Fusion plasmids: To construct plasmid pXG-0 (control plas-
mid to determine cellular autofluorescence), the p15A repli-
con of pZA31-luc was removed by SacI/AvrII restriction
digest and replaced with a SacI/AvrII fragment containing
the low-copy pSC101* replicon of pZS*24-MCS1.
Plasmid pXG-10, the standard plasmid for gfp fusion clon-
ing was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing
the pSC101* origin of replication, chloramphenicol resis-
tance cassette and the PLtetO promoter was amplified from
pXG-0 by PCR using primer pair JVO-0154/-0156, which
adds BfrBI and NheI restriction sites right downstream of
the promoter. The PCR product was digested with XbaI/
NheI, and ligated to a gfp+ encoding fragment amplified
from plasmid pWH601 (40) with primer pair JVO-0152/-
0153. Insertion of a BfrBI/NheI-digested PCR fragment
(containing the lacZ 50-UTR and the first 186 coding resi-
dues), amplified from chromosomal E.coli MC4100 DNA
using primer pair JVO-0274/-0328, into the corresponding
sites gave plasmid pXG-10.
To construct plasmid pXG-1, the PLtetO promoter and RBS
region of plasmid pZA31-luc was amplified with primers
pZE-CAT/JVO-0330. Upon AatII/NheI digest, the fragment
was inserted into plasmid pXG-10 digested with the same
enzymes. Consequently, in plasmid pXG-1 an ATG start
codon precedes the NheI site, and thus results in expression
of full-length GFP.
To construct plasmid pXG-20, which is used for 50-RACE
product cloning, the PLtetO promoter from pZA31-luc was
amplified with primers pZE-Cat/JVO-0339. The latter oligo
introduces a point mutation at the promoter (changing the C
at 1 to A) and adds a BfrBI restriction site to position +2.
The fragment was digested with AatII/BfrBI and inserted
into plasmid pXG-10 digested with the same enzymes.
BfrBI/NheI cloning of a PCR product obtained on chromoso-
mal E.coli MC4100 DNA with primers JVO-0368/-0369
resulted in an insert that contains an internal fragment of the
lacZ coding region (651–976 amino acid) and a BsgI site;
digest with BsgI will result in cleavage at the +1 site of PLtetO.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 3 1019
Plasmid pXG-30, the plasmid for operonic gfp fusion
cloning, was constructed as follows. First, an E.coli DNA
fragment spanning codons 2–59 of the lacZ gene was ampli-
fied with primers JVO-0642/-0685; oligo JVO-0685 added
a FLAG epitope preceded by ATG to the N-terminus of the
LacZ fragment. Upon KpnI/NheI digest, the fragment was
inserted into plasmid pXG-1 digested with the same restric-
tion enzymes, resulting in plasmid pJU-083. An internal frag-
ment of the E.coli galETKM locus, from the last 58 codons of
the galT C-terminal region to the 47th codon of galK, was
PCR-amplified from E.coli MC4100 with primer pair JVO-
0490/-0491, and inserted into pJU-083 by BfrBI/NheI clon-
ing, which gave plasmid pJU-088. E.coli Top10 transformed
with pJU-088 showed high fluorescence levels of GalK::GFP,
but only low signals for the LacZ::GalT fusion were
detectable in western blots with antibodies against the
FLAG epitope contained in the fusion. Therefore, a DNA
fragment containing the RBS of plasmid pZA31-luc was
PCR-amplified with primers JVO-1102/-1103, and fused in
a subsequent PCR step to a DNA fragment containing
a 3· FLAG epitope proceeded by an ATG start codon
obtained by PCR on plasmid pSUB11 (41) with primers
JVO-1100/-1101. The resulting DNA fragment was directly
ligated to a PCR product obtained on pJU-088 with primers
pZE-tetO/JVO-1104 to yield plasmid pXG-30.
For cloning of gfp fusions in pXG-10, chromosomal DNA
fragments were amplified by PCR with a sense oligonucleotide
which anneals to the transcriptional start-site (for many E.coli
K12 genes annotated at http://ecocyc.org/) of the gene of
interest and adds a BfrBI restriction site and an antisense
oligonucleotide which anneals in the N-terminal coding region
of the gene and adds an in frame NheI restriction site. The
corresponding primers for each gene are listed in Supplemen-
tary Table S2. Typically, the full-length 50-UTR (from +1
of the most proximal promoter of a gene) and 30–150 bp
(10–50 amino acid residues) of the N-terminal coding region
were cloned. Inclusion of extracytoplasmic signal sequences
(where known) were generally avoided to prevent traffic of
the fusion proteins to the periplasm/membrane.
Intra-operonic fusions established in pXG-30 were cloned
as above but the sense oligonucleotide annealed to the
C-terminal coding region of the upstream gene and adds the
BfrBI restriction site in frame.
sRNA plasmids: All sRNA plasmids constructed here are
based on plasmid pZE12-luc. First, a DNA fragment of
pZE12-luc was amplified by PCR using pfu-polymerase
(Fermentas) and primers PLlacoB and PLlacoD, and sub-
sequently digested with XbaI. This digest results in two
DNA fragments of 2.2 kb and 1.7 kb, respectively. The
2.2 kb fragment carries the PLlacO promoter (from the posi-
tion 1), an ampicillin resistance cassette, a ColE1 replicon
and a strong rrnB terminator followed by the sticky end
created by XbaI digestion. After gel-purification, it served
as the vector backbone for sRNA cloning. The E.coli micC
sRNA gene was PCR-amplified using primers JVO-0486/-
0489. The sense primer (JVO-0486) anneals to the +1 site
of micC and carries a 50 monophosphate for cloning. The anti-
sense primer (JVO-0489) binds to the region downstream of
the micC terminator and will add an XbaI site to the PCR
product. Following XbaI digest, the product was ligated to
the 2.2 kb XbaI fragment of pZE12-luc, to yield plasmid
pSK-017 upon transformation. Plasmid pSK-019 expressing
DicF sRNA was constructed similarly using primers JVO-
0487/-0488. To construct sRNA plasmids pJVgcvB-6
(gcvB), pJV100IA-T4 (rprA) and pJV107-8 (ryhB), the
sRNA genes were amplified with primer pairs gcvB6/
gcvB7, jb-100-L/jb-100-IA, and jb-107-G/jb-107-H, respec-
tively. Different to the micC cloning described above, how-
ever, these fragments were cloned by inserting them at the
KnpI site (pJV107-8, pJVgcvB-6), or the EcoRI site (pJV
100IA-T4) of pZE12-luc.
To lower the copy number, the ColE1 origin of pJV107-8
was swapped for the p15A origin of pZA31-luc by SpeI/AvrII
cloning, resulting in plasmid pJU-002. Similarly, the ColE1
origin of pJVgcvB-6 was swapped for the p15A origin of
pJU-002 by PacI/SpeI cloning, yielding plasmid pJU-014.
To construct control plasmid pTP-011, the ColE1 origin of
pJV300 was replaced by the p15A origin of pZA31-luc by
SpeI/AvrII cloning.
50 RACE and direct cloning of full-length gfp fusions
50 RACE was carried out as described previously (4) but with
modifications, the major being a new 50 RNA adapter (A4: 50-
GACGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGAGGAGGGAG-
UAGAAA-30OH), which contains a BseRI recognition site
(underlined) to facilitate cleavage of the obtained cDNA at
the 50 end of the ligated RNA. 50 triphosphates were con-
verted to 50 monophosphates by treatment of 6 mg total
RNA (obtained on strain E.coli MC4100 grown to an
OD600 of 2) with 10 U of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase
(TAP, Epicentre Technologies) at 37C for 30 min. Control
RNA was incubated in the absence of the TAP. Reactions
were stopped by phenol chloroform extraction, followed by
ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation. Pellets were dissolved
in water, mixed with 300 pmol of 50 RNA adapter A4,
heat-denatured at 95C for 5 min, followed by a 5 min
quick-chill step on ice. The adapter was ligated at 17C for
12 h with 40 U T4-RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in
the recommended buffer and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). Phenol chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated
RNA (2 mg) was then reverse-transcribed using 100 pmol ran-
dom DNA hexamers and the SuperScriptIII RT system (Invit-
rogen) in a total volume of 20 ml. Reverse transcription was
performed in four subsequent 15 min steps at 42C, 50C,
55C and 60C. The RT enzyme was inactivated at 85C
for 5 min, followed by RNase H (New England Biolabs,
1 U)-treatment for 20 min at 37C.
For direct cloning of full-length gfp fusions, 1 ml cDNA
served as template in a standard PCR using taq polymerase
(New England Biolabs), and 25 pmol each of a gene-specific
primer (antisense to the N-terminal coding region of the gene
of interest and with a NheI site extension) and the adapter-
specific primer JVO-0367. Products were separated on 3%
agarose gels, bands of interest excised (stronger bands in
TAP-treated samples compared to mock-treated samples
indicated full-length transcripts), gel-eluted (Jetsorb,
Genomed) and digested with BseRI and NheI. The digested
DNA fragment was cloned into the BsgI/NheI digested
plasmid pXG-20. In some cases, weak TAP-specific PCR
products required a second PCR amplification step using the
same primer combinations to increase DNA yields for cloning.

In vivo whole-cell colony plate fluorescence imaging
E.coli Top10 cells expressing plasmid-borne gfp fusions
were streaked on standard LB plates supplemented with the
appropriate antibiotics. After over night growth colonies
were photographed in a FUJI LAS-3000 image analyzer
using a CCD camera with a 510 nm emission filter and
excitation at 460 nm.
Liquid culture whole-cell fluorescence measurements
and data processing
To measure whole-cell fluorescence in liquid culture, E.coli
strains harboring gfp fusion plasmids were inoculated 1/100
from overnight cultures into 20 ml fresh LB medium in erlen-
meyer flasks. Three independent overnight cultures were used
throughout the study for each strain. Cultures were incubated
with aeration at 37C/220 r.p.m. and cell density was
followed by measuring OD600. At the indicated cell density,
three aliquots (150 ml) of each culture were transferred to
a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc, cat# 167008), and fluores-
cence measured at 37C (optical excitation filter 480/31
nm, emission filter 520/10 nm, 0.2 s, CW lamp energy 21673,
measurement height 8.0 mm) in a Victor3 machine (1420
Multilable Counter, Perkin Elmer).
To calculate absolute fluorescence of a given strain, the
mean fluorescence of the three aliquots from each of the
three independently grown cultures was determined. Unless
stated otherwise, cellular autofluorescence was subtracted to
obtain the specific fluorescence of the gfp fusion. Herein,
the fluorescence of strains harboring the same sRNA expres-
sion or control plasmid in combination with the negative con-
trol plasmid pXG-0 (expressing luciferase, i.e. no gfp) was
measured as described above and subtracted from absolute
fluorescence values obtained in presence of the gfp fusion
plasmid of interest.
The regulatory effect of a sRNA on a given gfp fusion was
calculated as follows. Strains harboring the fusion of interest
in combination with a specific negative control plasmid
(i.e. without sRNA expression), were measured to obtain
absolute fluorescence values and autofluorescence of strains
harboring the same negative control plasmid in combination
with pXG-0 was subtracted resulting in the ‘unregulated gfp
fusion specific fluorescence’. Strains harboring the same gfp
fusion of interest in combination with a specific sRNA
expression plasmid were measured and the autofluorescence
of strains harboring the same sRNA expression plasmid in
combination with pXG-0 was subtracted to give the ‘regu-
lated gfp fusion specific fluorescence’. Fold regulation medi-
ated by expression of a sRNA was calculated by dividing
the ‘unregulated gfp fusion specific fluorescence’ by the
‘regulated gfp fusion specific fluorescence’.
Fluorescence measurements in microtiter plates
and data processing
Fluorescence measurements in 96-well microtiter plates was
carried out as described in (42) with modifications. Single
colonies (triplicate) of E.coli strains harboring gfp fusion
and sRNA expression plasmids were inoculated in 150 ml
LB in a 96-well microtiter plate and these cultures were over-
layed with 50 ml mineral oil (Sigma) to prevent evaporation.
Cultures were grown in a Victor3 fluorimeter set at 37C and
assayed with an automatically repeating protocol of shaking
(2 mm orbital, normal speed, 900 s), absorbance (OD)
measurements (600 nm, P600 filter, 0.1 s) and fluorescence
readings (optical excitation filter 480/31 nm, emission filter
520/10 nm, 0.2 s, CW lamp energy 21 673). OD600 and
flurorescence were measured at 17 min intervals (60 in total).
To plot fluorescence over OD600, curves of all three
cultures within a triplicate were independently established
first. The linear range of increasing fluorescence during
growth covered by all members within a triplicate was
selected individually and a cut-off set at the OD600 were at
least one member showed non-linear increase of fluorescence.
An average curve was calculated for each triplicate and the
cellular autofluorescence curve of a strain harboring pXG-0
and pJV300 negative control plasmids subtracted. The
OD600 range in which all measured cultures showed near-
linear fluorescence increase is shown in Figure 9A.
To calculate the regulatory effect of sRNA expression on
the ompC fusion (Figure 9B), fluorescence of E.coli strains
harboring the ompC fusion in combination with a sRNA
expression plasmid was divided by the fluorescence of a strain
harboring the ompC fusion in combination with the sRNA
control plasmid, pJV300.
Whole-cell protein fractions and western blot
Culture samples were taken according to 1 OD600 if not
stated otherwise. Samples were spun 2 min at 16 100 g at
4C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1· sample loading
buffer (Fermentas, #R0891) to a final concentration of
0.01 OD/ml. Samples were heated 5 min at 95C.
A total of 0.01 or 0.05 OD of whole-cell protein fractions
of strains expressing highly or weakly fluorescent GFP
fusions, respectively, were separated by 15% SDS–PAGE.
Gels were blotted for 60 min at 100 V at 4C in a cable
tank blotter (Peqlab) onto PVDF (PerkinElmer) membrane
in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris base, 190 mM Glycin and
20% Methanol). After rinsing in TBST20 buffer (20 mM
Tris base, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20), membranes
were blocked for 1 h in 10% dry milk in TBTS20, followed
by incubation with a-GFP monoclonal (Roche
#11814460001) or a-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma
#F1804; 1:1000 in 3% BSA, TBST20) for 1 h at RT, 5 ·
6 min wash in TBST20, a-mouse-horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) (Amersham Biosciences #NXA931; 1:5000 in 3%
BSA in TBST20) for 1 h at RT, 6 · 10 min wash in
TBST20. For simultaneous detection of GroEL (loading
control), membranes were cut after the blocking step at the
47.5 kDa band indicated by the prestained protein marker
(Fermentas), GroEL was detected using a-GroEL antisera
conjugated with HRP (Sigma #A8705, 1:1000 in 3% BSA,
TBST20; 2 h incubation at RT, followed by 6 · 10 min
washes in TBST20). Blots were developed using Western
Lightning reagent (PerkinElmer), and signals detected with
a Fuji LAS-3000 CCD camera.
RNA isolation and northern detection
TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) or the Promega SV total
RNA purification kit were used according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol or as described at www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/
microarrays/protocols.html, respectively, to isolate total RNA.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 3 1021
Unless stated otherwise, RNA was isolated from cells grown
to an OD600 of 1.
To detect gfp fusion mRNAs or sRNAs, RNA samples (cor-
responding to 0.7 OD culture volume) were denatured for
5 min at 95C in loading buffer (containing 95% formamide),
separated on 8.3 M urea 5 or 6% polyacrylamide gels, and
transferred to Hybond-XL membranes (GE Healthcare) by
electro-blotting (1 h, 50 V, 4C) in a tank blotter (Peqlab).
For detection of the chromosomal sdhCDAB polycistronic
mRNA 20 mg total RNA was separated on a 1.5% Agarose
gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to
a Hybond-XL membrane by upward capillary transfer in
10· SSC overnight as described (43).
DsrA, GcvB, MicA, MicC, MicF, RyhB, SgrS and Spot42
were detected using 50 end-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides
JVO-1367, JVO-0321, JVO-1371, JVO-1369, JVO-0909,
JVO-0223, JVO-1366 and JVO-1368, respectively. 5S
rRNA and gfp fusion mRNAs were detected with end-labeled
oligodeoxyribonucleotide JVO-0322 and JVO-155, respec-
tively. The sdhCD fusion mRNA was detected with a random-
labeled ([32P] dCTP; Readiprime II labeling kit, GE
Healthcare) PCR fragment generated with primer pair JVO-
0642/-1101. To detect the chromosomally expressed sdh-
CDAB polycistronic mRNA, a PCR fragment generated
with primer pair JVO-1360/1361 was in vitro-transcribed
from the T7 promoter (added by primer JVO-1361) in the
presence of [a-32P]UTP using Ambion’s T7 polymerase
Maxiscript kit. Riboprobes were purified over a G50 column.
Prehybridization and hybridization of membranes with
riboprobes, DNA probes, or oligonucleotides was carried
out in Roti-Hybri-Quick buffer (Roth, #A981.1) at 70C,
65C, or 42C, respectively, for 2 h. Membranes hybridized
with riboprobes were washed at 65C in three subsequent
15 min steps in SSC (2·, 1· and 0.5·)/0.1% SDS solutions,
after rinsing the membrane first in 2· SSC/0.1% SDS.
Membranes hybridized with PCR fragments were rinsed in
2· SSC/0.1% SDS, followed by 15 min washes in
2· (65C), 1· and 0.5· (42C) SSC/0.1% SDS. For end-
labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides hybridization membranes
were rinsed in 5· SSC followed by three wash steps at
42C in SSC (5·, 1· and 0.5·, respectively). Signals
were visualized on a phosphorimager (FLA-3000 Series,
Fuji), and band intensities quantified with AIDA software
(Raytest, Germany).
RESULTS
General approach
To study sRNA-mediated translational control at the 50 region
of a given target mRNA (from here on: target), we use two
compatible plasmids derived from the pZE series of expres-
sion vectors (44) that can be stably maintained in an E.coli
recA- strain (Figure 1A). The target plasmid is a low-copy
vector that carries a pSC101* origin of replication
(3–4 plasmid copies/cell), a cat chloramphenicol resistance
marker, and the 50 sequence of the target as a translational
fusion to the N-terminus of GFP. Transcription of the gfp
fusion gene is driven by PLtetO-1, a constitutive promoter
that is derived from the native phage l PL promoter (44).
The sRNA plasmid is a high-copy vector carrying a ColE1
origin of replication (70 copies/cell) and a bla ampicillin
resistance gene. The sRNA gene of interest is cloned under
control of the constitutive PLlacO-1 promoter [another
modified version of l PL; (44)] such that transcription will
precisely start at the native +1 site of the sRNA.
The constant transcription rate of both the regulatory
sRNA and the target fusion is a key feature of this system.
It uncouples both players from the chromosomal transcrip-
tional network, and diminishes the possible pleiotropic effects
of sRNA expression on target fusion transcription. It also
ensures high yields of the expressed RNAs, thus minimizing
the contribution of any transcripts from the chromosomal
copies of the respective sRNA or target genes. In case the
high transcription rate of either promoter yields toxic RNA
levels, it may be controlled in E.coli strains that encode
the LacI or TetR repressor proteins [repressing PLlacO-1 or
PLtetO-1, respectively; (44)] by addition of an appropriate
inducer. Alternatively, sRNA genes are cloned on a plasmid
carrying a p15A origin of replication, thus lowering the copy
number to 20 per cell (44).
E.coli cells carrying a target fusion plasmid of interest are
transformed with plasmids expressing either the cognate regu-
latory sRNA or a nonsense (control) RNA. The GFP fluores-
cence of the resulting transformants is subsequently read out
from colonies on LB agar plates or from cells grown in liquid
culture, and corrected for the autofluorescence of E.coli.
Fusions that exhibit higher GFP activity in the presence of
a sRNA plasmid are considered activated, whereas lower
GFP fluorescence indicates target repression. In cases where
GFP activity is low, i.e. close to autofluorescence, western
blotting with an anti-GFP antibody provides a more sensitive
measure for quantification of fusion protein levels.
Cloning and activity of translational gfp fusions
All gfp fusions described carry the gfp+ allele, which
encodes a GFP variant that combines mutations for higher
fluorescence yield and increased folding efficiency (45).
Plasmid pXG-10 is the standard plasmid for directional
cloning of a potential target mRNA sequence as N-terminal
translational fusion to GFP (Figure 1B). Selected target
regions are PCR-amplified using a sense primer that binds to
the +1 site (if known) of the target gene and adds a BfrBI
restriction site to this sequence, and an antisense primer that
binds in the 50 coding region and adds a NheI restriction site
in frame with the target gene. Plasmid pXG-10 has a single
BfrBI site at the +1 position of the PLtetO-1 promoter hence
all fusion transcripts will have a uniform AUGCAU 50 end.
The single NheI site (GCTAGC) of pXG-10 represents the
2nd and 3rd codon of the gfp reading frame, hence the trans-
lational target gene fusion will be to full-length GFP protein.
Control plasmid pXG-0 does not contain a gfp gene but instead
constitutively expresses luciferase, and is used to determine
the autofluorescence background of E.coli cells. Control plas-
mid pXG-1 expresses full-length GFP and carries an artificial
50-UTR containing a strong RBS that is derived from the pZE
family of expression vectors (44). Two additional fusion vec-
tors, pXG-20 and pXG-30, were constructed for cloning of 50
RACE products and of intra-operonic target sequences,
respectively (Figure 1B). The cloning strategies for these plas-
mids are described along with their applications further below.

Figure 1. Principle approach and gfp fusion cloning strategies. (A) Putative sRNA target sequences are cloned as translational fusions to gfp on a low-copy vector
that carries a pSC101* origin of replication (3–4 plasmid copies/cell) and confers chloramphenicol resistance. The fusion is transcribed from a constitutive l
PLtetO-1 promoter (PL derivative). Regulatory sRNAs are cloned on a high-copy vector that carries a ColE1 origin of replication (70 copies/cell) and confers
ampicillin resistance. The sRNA gene is cloned under control of the constitutive PLlacO-1 promoter (another derivative of l PL) such that transcription will
precisely start at the native +1 site of the sRNA. For E.coli cells that carry both plasmids, the effect of a given sRNA on a target fusion can be determined by
monitoring GFP fluorescence of colonies grown on agar plates, of liquid cultures grown in standard laboratory flasks or in microtiter plates, or by flow cytometry.
Combinations of fusion and sRNA expression plasmids with control plasmids are used to determine (i) the basal fluorescence of E.coli cells and how it is affected
by sRNA overexpression, (ii) the general effect of the plasmid-borne sRNA gene on GFP expression and (iii) the specific effect of an sRNA on a target fusion of
interest. (B) Putative target sequences are PCR-amplified and cloned into specialized gfp fusion vectors. If the target sequence is derived from a monocistronic
gene or the first gene of an operon, and its promoter is known (left panel), it is amplified with an upstream primer that binds at the +1 site of the target gene and
adds a BfrBI site, and a downstream primer that binds in the N-terminal region of the target gene and adds an NheI site in frame with the target gene coding
region. The resulting PCR product is inserted into the standard fusion vector, pXG-10, digested with BfrBI/NheI. If the promoter +1 site is unknown (middle
panel), the target sequence is amplified from cDNA of total E.coli RNA that was ligated to a 50 RNA linker oligo upon treatment with TAP (this enzyme converts
the 50 PPP group of primary transcripts to 50 P and thus allows the differential amplification of cDNAs that correspond to the native +1 site of an mRNA). The
amplified cDNA will carry a 50 BseRI site (contained in the RNA linker sequence). Insertion of the NheI/BseRI-digested cDNA into NheI/BsgI-digested RACE
fusion plasmid, pXG-20, ensures that transcription of the fusion mRNA starts at the native +1 site of the target gene. Target sequences that are derived from
within polycistronic mRNAs are amplified and cloned into the operon fusion vector pXG-30 (right panel). The upstream primer adds a BfrBI site in frame with
the C-terminus of the upstream ORF; cloning into pXG-30 will create a C-terminal fusion to a short artificial reading frame composed of a FLAG epitope and a
truncated lacZ gene, thus mimicking operon mRNA expression. See text and Figure 6A for more details.

Using these vectors, we have thus far constructed
>80 translational gfp fusions to diverse genes of E.coli,
Salmonella typhimurium and Vibrio cholerae, which are
listed in Table 1 and in Supplementary Table S3. These
fusions include several known targets of E.coli sRNAs,
which were the focus of this study, as well as various
mRNAs that were predicted as sRNA targets in our labo-
ratory (C. M. Sharma and J. Vogel, unpublished data). For
simplicity, the fusions listed throughout this paper refer to
E.coli genes unless stated otherwise.
A preliminary determination of fluorescence on standard
LB agar plates by visual inspection revealed large variations
of GFP activity among these reporter strains. Figure 2A
shows images of five representative reporter strains that
were used for a rough classification of GFP activity
(Table 1). Fusions that show fluorescence similar to full-
length GFP (control plasmid pXG-1), e.g. ompC, were classi-
fied +++. Interestingly, a sodB fusion exhibited a higher fluo-
rescence than pXG-1, and was thus classified ++++. Fusions
with intermediate yet readily detectable fluorescence, e.g.
oppA were marked ++, whereas fusions, such as ptsG with
levels just above the autofluorescence of pGX-0 cells were
classified +. Altogether, >80% of the 68 E.coli fusions listed
in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3 had detectable fluo-
rescence on agar plates, and all but the sodB fusion (smaller
colonies) formed colonies of regular size.
We next determined the GFP activity of a broad set of
fusions in liquid culture (Figure 2B). Overnight cultures
were diluted into fresh LB media, and overall culture fluo-
rescence was determined at five growth stages, i.e. at a cell
density of OD600 of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 2. We observed an
almost linear correlation of cell number and culture fluores-
cence, as well as small standard deviations within triplicates,
with fusions that had shown high GFP activity on plates
(Figure 2B, right panel). Several fusions surpassed the full-
length GFP expressed from pXG-1 in terms of fluorescence,
i.e. ftsZ, hns, ompC, ompF, and sodB. In contrast,
many fusions with low GFP activity required growth to an
OD600 > 0.5 for reliable detection (Figure 2B, left panel).
Interestingly, some of the target genes that yielded low
GFP activity had previously been fused to lacZ, e.g. fhlA or
rpoS, and similarly small (<200) Miller unit numbers had
been reported (22,25,26). However, we need to caution
against a general comparison to previously published lacZ
fusion results since these fusions greatly vary in their way
of construction (chromosomal versus plasmid-borne fusions),
the growth stage at which b-galactosidase activity was deter-
mined, as well as enzyme activity units.
We next sought to determine a correlation among reporter
fluorescence, steady-state fusion mRNA levels and fusion
protein accumulation. Northern blots of RNA samples taken
at two growth stages were probed for the gfp portion of the
fusion mRNAs, and likewise fusion protein levels were deter-
mined on western blots with a mixture of two monoclonal
antibodies that recognize GFP. A cross-comparison of GFP
fluorescence (Figure 2B) with the corresponding mRNA

and protein levels (Figure 2C) indicates a good correlation in
five cases, i.e. the sodB, ptsG, rpoS and lacZ29 fusions, and
wild-type GFP. For example, both the mRNA and fusion pro-
tein levels of the bright sodB fusion far exceed those of
wild-type GFP. In contrast, the ptsG and rpoS fusions, both
being in the lower fluorescence range, are hardly detectable
at the mRNA and protein level. However, the case of the
two different lacZ::gfp fusions included here merits further

(A) E.coli strains carrying control plasmids (no gfp ¼ pXG-0; gfp ¼ pXG-1) or target fusion plasmids (as indicated) were grown on LB agar. The left image was
obtained in the visible light mode and shows the colony morphology of these strains. The right image shows the same plate in the fluorescence mode. GFP
fluorescence was excitated at 460 nm, and light emission was recorded using a 510 nm-filter. (B) Fluorescence of E.coli cells carrying the indicated gfp fusions at

the indicated fusion plasmids at OD600 of 0.5 and 1, and were subjected to western blot analysis with monoclonal a-GFP antibodies (upper panel) and to northern
analysis (middle panel). The same northern blot was probed for 5S rRNA as a loading control (lower panel).

description. Fusion lacZ186 differs from lacZ29 by the addi-
tional inclusion of residues 30–186 of LacZ (Table 1). Even
though there were drastic differences between the mRNA
levels and processing patterns of the two fusions, comparable
amounts of fusion protein were detected (Figure 2C). Fluores-
cence still differed by a factor of 3 (Figure 2B), indicating
that the larger LacZ portion of lacZ186 may affect proper
folding or solubility of the GFP fusion protein. It may thus
be advisable to keep the fused target sequence as short as
possible, thereby also avoiding the inclusion of intact signal
peptides of extracytoplasmic target proteins.
Repression of target fusions by sRNAs
We cloned several regulatory sRNAs previously reported by
us and others (see Table 2) into a ColE1-based vector that is
compatible with the aforedescribed gfp fusion plasmids. Our
strategy ensures transcription from the plasmid-borne consti-
tutive PLlacO promoter to start precisely at the native +1 site
of the sRNA (see Materials and Methods). Plasmid pJV300,
which expresses a 50 nt nonsense RNA derived from the
rrnB terminator region (46), is the standard control vector
for these PL-driven sRNA expression plasmids.
The RyhB and the GcvB plasmids gave aberrantly small
colonies after transformation of E.coli; we thus lowered
their copy number by replacing the ColE1 origin with
p15A. We also note that on three sRNA expression plasmids
that we obtained from other labs (Table 2), OxyS and Spot42
are expressed from a different constitutive promoter and
DsrA from its native promoter.
We first checked possible effects of these plasmid-
expressed sRNAs on the activity of full-length GFP (plasmid
pXG-1). Figure 3A, upper left panel, shows the changes of
fluorescence in the presence of diverse sRNA plasmids
normalized to fluorescence obtained with the corresponding
control plasmid (see Table 2). Most of these sRNA plasmids
had a negligible effect on GFP fluorescence, whereas DsrA,
RyhB and Spot42 positively changed fluorescence up to
1.5-fold. This unspecific effect will have to be taken into
account when calculating the regulation of target mRNA
fusions. Although some of these plasmids (DsrA, RyhB and
Spot42) were observed to affect bacterial growth, either
causing a longer lag phase or earlier entry into stationary
phase (data not shown), this does not seem to influence
GFP expression.
Subsequently, we combined 10 sRNA plasmids with eight
target fusions. We expected to see repression with the sRNA/
target pairs, DsrA/hns (47), MicA/ompA (17,18), MicC/ompC
(16), MicF/ompF (29), RyhB/sodB (20), SgrS/ptsG (48,49)
and Spot42/galK (50). In addition, there was some evidence
of dppA mRNA being a target of GcvB (51). RprA and
IstR-1, which regulate rpoS (52) and tisAB (14), respectively,
were included as unspecific control RNAs (for simplicity,
IstR-1 is referred to as IstR throughout this paper).
Figure 3A shows that for each of the targets tested in this
array, the previously described regulatory sRNA provided
the highest degree of repression. Generally, repression was
more pronounced for target fusions with high fluorescence
yields, as it is most obvious for ompC (cf. Figure 3A),
which was regulated >20-fold by MicC, but less than 2-fold
by any other sRNA. The low fluorescence dppA fusion was
repressed 3-fold by GcvB, but this repression appeared to
be specific since GcvB had marginal effects on all the other
targets; DsrA and Spot42 even had a positive effect on dppA
in line with their aforementioned activating effect on GFP
alone (Figure 3A). At first glance, the subtle regulation
observed for the low fluorescent ptsG fusion by SgrS seems
to be the least specific one in this array. At an OD600 of 1,
ptsG had a regular fluorescence value of 47 000 (arbitrary
units), which was close to the E.coli autofluorescence

(38 000 to 40 000) and renders reliable calculations of
regulation factors difficult. To measure ptsG regulation
more precisely, we determined PtsG::GFP protein expression
(by western blot) in the presence of all sRNAs. Figure 3B
shows that SgrS reduced the PtsG::GFP signal to background
levels, whereas all other tested sRNA plasmids had negligible
effects. This confirms the high specificity and regulatory
strength of the SgrS/ptsG interaction, while it also indicates
the requirement for a minimal fusion activity to observe
clear-cut regulation in liquid culture measurements.
Ultimate proof for in vivo interaction is typically obtained by
the introduction of compensatory base pairs in the regulatory
sRNA and its mRNA target. The so-called M6 mutation in
the MicA/ompA pair refers to simultaneous disruption of 6 bp
in this interaction site, either obtained by mutation of MicA or
ompA. Previously, introduction of six compensatory mutations
in ompA to restore base pairing with the MicA_M6 mutant
RNA (and vice versa) successfully restored regulation of
MicA/ompA as measured by the activity of plasmid-borne
ompA::lacZ fusions (17). Since this provided a means for direct
comparison between a lacZ and a gfp reporter, the same muta-
tions were introduced in ompA::gfp. Similar to the data
reported by (17), wild-type ompA::gfp was hardly regulated
by MicA_M6 at the fusion mRNA or protein level, whereas
ompAM6::gfp was regulated by MicA_M6 but hardly
responded to wild-type MicA (Figure 4B). This finding proves
that gfp is as reliable a reporter of ompA regulation as lacZ.
The length of the fused target mRNA sequence could be
another determinant of sRNA regulation. Ideally, the cloned
region would encompass the entire 50-UTR and include
a short stretch of the coding region. We reasoned that fusion
cloning should be based on the native 50-UTR to ensure
a comparable stability of the fusion transcript to the parental
mRNA. However, the +1 site or promoter is only known for a
subset of the E.coli genes, and even less information on trans-
cription start sites is available for other bacteria. To solve this
problem, we developed vector pXG-20 as part of a cloning
strategy that combines +1 site mapping and rapid fusion
cloning (Figure 1B). Briefly, this includes a 50 RACE proto-
col that distinguishes primary 50 mRNA ends (carrying a tri-
phosphate) group from processed mRNA species (2,4,53,54),
followed by the direct insertion of a target mRNA 50 RACE
fragment into vector pXG-20 such that transcription from
PLtetO will precisely start at the mapped +1 site. The full pro-
tocol and an example of 50 RACE fusion cloning are provided
in the Supplementary Data. Following this approach we were
able to directly clone an ompA::gfp fusion using E.coli
total cDNA as PCR template. The obtained plasmid,
pOmpA*::gfp, contains the same full-length fusion as
ompA::gfp, but without the 50-ATGCAT extension added in
the standard cloning procedure. To investigate how varying
the length of a target 50-UTR would affect regulation, two
shorter derivatives of the ompA*::gfp fusion were constructed.
The 133 nt ompA 50-untranslated leader (Figure 4A), as con-
tained in ompA*::gfp, is well-characterized in terms of both
its 50 end structure (55) and the MicA interaction site
(17,18). Moreover, the first 115 nt containing two stem–
loop structures were shown to act as a stabilizer of ompA
mRNA in vivo (56,57). In ompA-95, the first stem–loop was
destroyed, thus creating a 50 end that should be single-
stranded. In ompA-30, transcription was expected to start
only 30 nt upstream of the ompA start codon; this mutant
retained the MicA target site but not the ompA Hfq binding
site (58). Figure 4C shows that destruction of the stabiliza-
tion stem–loop I (ompA-95) had no effect on fusion mRNA
or protein abundance, and that repression by MicA was
unaffected. However, ompA-30 yielded a much less abun-
dant and partially degraded fusion mRNA, and no detectable
fusion protein, which rendered it difficult to determine regu-
lation by MicA.
Activation of an rpoS fusion by sRNAs
While repression of target translation is the predominant
mode of sRNA action, the rpoS mRNA provides an excellent
example to study activation by sRNAs [reviewed in (59)].

by black boxes. The 50 ends of the two truncated ompA fusion, ompA-30 and ompA-95, are circled. (B) Introduction of compensatory base pair changes into MicA
sRNA, yielding MicA_M6, restored regulation of the mutated ompAM6 fusion mRNA, thus confirming specific pairing of the two RNAs in vivo. The M6
mutation in ompA or MicA simultaneously disrupts base pairing between ompA and MicA at six positions, as described previously (17). E.coli strains carrying the
ompA wild-type or ompAM6 mutant fusion plasmid were combined with a control plasmid (no sRNA expression), or the MicA or MicAM6 expression plasmids.
Samples were taken at an OD600 of 1, and subjected to western (upper panel) and northern (lower two panels) blot analysis as in Figure 2C. (C) Effects of 5

truncations on ompA* fusion mRNA stability and regulation by MicA. In the ompA* wild-type fusion (constructed by 50 RACE cloning, see text), transcription
from the constitutive PLtetO promoter starts at the native ompA +1 site. Destruction of the terminal stem–loop of the ompA leader neither affects stability or
translation of the mutant fusion ompA-95, nor its repression by MicA. However, further shortening of the ompA leader as in mutant ompA-30, which is deprived
of both stem–loops, results in partial degradation of the fusion mRNA and loss of fusion protein translation. Samples were taken and probed as in (B).

We tested activation of an rpoS::gfp fusion with a set of sRNA
plasmids, expecting higher fluorescence exclusively with
DsrA and RprA, two sRNAs that act to melt the inhibitory
structure that sequesters the rpoS RBS. Although rpoS::gfp
fluorescence is in the lower activity range (Table 1), its activa-
tion in the presence of DsrA or RprA plasmids is already visi-
ble on agar plates (Figure 5A). Such activation was also
observed in liquid culture (Figure 5B), and generally the two
sRNAs elevated fluorescence stronger than any other sRNA or
the control plasmid. However, in these measurements the poor
fluorescence of the rpoS fusion rendered calculation of activa-
tion factors difficult. Thus, the regulation factor in this case is
given as the ratio of rpoS fusion fluorescence to E.coli
autofluorescence, each obtained in the presence of the same
control or sRNA expression plasmid. As seen before with
other low fluorescence fusions (e.g. ptsG; Figure 3A and B),
direct detection of the fusion protein on western blots provided
a much clearer picture of regulation (Figure 5C). The >3-fold
and the 7-fold activation determined here for RprA and DsrA,
respectively, are in excellent agreement with data obtained
with a chromosomal rpoS::lacZ fusion (25,52).
Intra-operonic sRNA target sites
The target genes investigated so far were either mono-
cistronic or first in an operon. Some sRNAs, however, target

UTRs of downstream reading frames within a polycistronic
mRNA. In the case of the polycistronic galETKM mRNA,
Spot42 binds to the galK RBS region, which leads to transla-
tional repression of galK without affecting expression of the
two upstream genes, galE and galT; consequently, this type
of regulation was termed discoordinate operon expression
(50). RyhB, which is predicted to block the sdhD RBS,
may regulate the sdhCDAB operon mRNA in a similar fash-
ion (20). Such intra-operonic targets could pose a challenge
for our approach since transcription of the fusion mRNA
would not start at its native +1 site, thus creating an arbitrary
50 end that could destabilize the fusion mRNA. To solve this
problem, we developed vector pXG-30, in which intra-
operonic target genes are expressed as part of an artifical
dicistronic mRNA (Figure 1B). Putative target genes are
cloned on pXG-30 as dual fusions: the upstream coding
sequence is fused to the C-terminus of a FLAG epitope-
tagged, truncated lacZ gene (FlacZ0), whereas the actual tar-
get gene is fused to gfp as described above. In addition, the
FlacZ0 ORF is preceded by a strong RBS derived from pro-
tein expression vector pZE12-luc (44) to ensure efficient
translation initiation of the dicistronic operon mRNA. Next
we cloned the sdhCD and galTK target sequences of
RyhB and Spot42, respectively, in plasmids pXG10 and
pXG30, and compared the GFP activity of these fusions
(Figure 6A). Following the GFP activity over growth, we
observed striking differences for the two vector types in the
case of either fusion (Figure 6B). Specifically, when
the sdhCD target site is cloned on standard vector pXG-10,
the fluorescence of this fusion is close to background levels.
However, if the same sequence is cloned into operon plasmid
pXG-30, it yields a fusion with well-detectable GFP activity.
Moreover, activity of the galTK fusion was also enhanced
2-fold by cloning into pXG30 as compared to pXG10.
In the pXG30-based galTK and sdhCD constructs, the
upstream and downstream fusion proteins can be specifically
detected with anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies, respec-
tively (Figure 6C). According to the concept of discoordinate
gal operon expression (50), we expected a reduction of
GalK::GFP levels upon Spot42 co-expression but no change
of FLacZ0::GalT levels. Quantification of the western blot
signals shown in Figure 6C revealed an 8-fold decrease of
GalK::GFP in the presence of the Spot42 plasmid, but also
a 10-fold reduction of FLacZ0::GalT (Figure 6C, compare

Shown are western blots of total protein samples taken at an OD600 of 1. Probing with a-GFP antibodies detected the SdhD::GFP and GalK::GFP proteins (upper

control (lower panel). (D) Northern blot of RNA samples taken from E.coli strains (grown to an OD600 of 1) that carry the sdhCD fusion in combination with the

the RyhB expression plasmid (lane 4). In the upper panel, the blot was probed for the plasmid-expressed sdhCD fusion mRNA using a labeled FlacZ0 dsDNA
fragments. In the lower panel, the same blot was hybridized with an sdhC-specific probe to detect the chromosomally expressed sdhCDAB mRNA. 5 mg of total
RNA were loaded in lanes 1 and 2, whereas 20 mg were loaded in lanes 3 and 4.

lanes 5 and 6). While the first was in keeping with the previ-
ously published model, the strong reduction of the GalT
fusion protein seemed to contradict it. However, Spot42 has
been consistently observed to have a 3-fold negative effect
on the FLacZ0 moeity in other non-target constructs,
e.g. FLacZ0::SdhC (Figure 6C, lanes 1 and 2, and data not
shown). Since no other sRNA tested by us has shown a similar
effect, we believe that this is a currently unexplained pecu-
liarity of Spot42. If corrected for this target-independent
FlacZ0-dependent effect, Spot42 regulates the galT part only
3.3-fold as opposed to 8-fold galK regulation. Notably, this is
in very good agreement with (50), who reported 1.4-fold and
4.9-fold regulation of galT and galK expression, respectively.
Whereas this data confirmed discoordinate gal operon
expression by Spot42, we were unable to mimic RyhB-
mediated regulation of the sdhCDAB operon. As shown in
Figure 6C, RyhB co-expression did not regulate the sdhCD
fusion whereas it had a drastic effect on the sodB fusion
(Figures 3A and 8B). However, in contrast to the sdhCD
fusion, we did see a RyhB effect on the native sdhCDAB
operon mRNA (Figure 6D). As outlined in the discussion sec-
tion, this result does not call into question sdhCDAB as
a RyhB target, or the use of pXG30 to study intra-operonic
sRNA targets.
Regulation is independent of major RNA
processing factors
Bacterial RNA metabolism involves a large number of
ribonucleases and other RNA-binding proteins, three of
which—Hfq, RNase E and RNase III—are known to play
prominent roles for the activity of trans-encoded antisense
RNAs. In principle, our GFP system is well-suited to test
the contribution of such factors by determining sRNA/target
regulation in the respective hfq and RNase deletion strains.
For RNase E is encoded by an essential gene (rne), we
resorted to a viable rne701 mutant strain. This mutant
expresses a C-terminally truncated RNase E that is defective
both in interaction with Hfq and in assembly of a functional
degradosome, and was recently shown to impair RyhB and
SgrS action on their targets mRNAs (13,60). The rne701
and the Dhfq mutant strains were transformed with the ten
sRNA/target pairs listed in Table 3. In the absence of sRNA
expression plasmids, all of these fusions exhibited normal or
even slightly enhanced activity in either of the two mutant
strains (data not shown). Upon sRNA co-expression, none of
the cognate sRNA completely failed to regulate its target in
the rne701 background (Table 3), although the degree of
regulation differed from the wild-type background in some
cases. We also investigated if the RNase E truncation had
an impact on degradation of the target fusion mRNAs.
Figure 7A shows the effects of sRNA overexpression on
three omp target fusions in wild-type and rne701 cells. Strik-
ingly, although reduction of OmpA::GFP fusion protein syn-
thesis by MicA is unaffected in rne701 cells (as compared to
wild-type cells), the mutation strongly impairs degradation of
the ompA fusion mRNA. The other fusion mRNAs we tested,
i.e. ompC and ompF (Figure 7A) and hns, ptsG and sodB
(Supplementary Figure S2) also showed some defect in fusion
mRNA decay upon co-expression of the cognate sRNA in
rne701 cells, although this was far less obvious than with
the MicA-ompA pair.
In stark contrast, the hfq deletion abrogated regulation of
almost all sRNA/target pairs (Table 3). Since numerous
sRNAs were previously observed to be unstable in the
absence of Hfq, we compared the amounts of overexpressed
sRNAs between wild-type and Dhfq cells. As shown in
Table 3 and Figure 7B, the hfq deletion reduced the steady-
state levels of most sRNAs, which would also contribute to
the observed loss of regulation. However, the data also indi-
cates that Hfq contributes to regulation independent of sRNA
stabilization. For example, the hfq deletion reduced RyhB
levels to 30%, yet sodB regulation to 1.6-fold as compared
to 12-fold in wild-type cells. In addition, DsrA levels in the
Dhfq strain were indistinguishable from the wild-type back-
ground; in the absence of Hfq, DsrA could still promote
rpoS activation whereas it entirely failed to repress hns trans-
lation. Interestingly, this is in keeping with a previous obser-
vation that multi-copy DsrA could partially bypass the Hfq
requirement for rpoS but not for hns regulation (61).
Assaying sRNA/target regulation in a strain defective of
RNase III (rnc14) proved more difficult. For unknown rea-
sons, all fusions showed dramatically lower activity, often
indistinguishable from the E.coli autofluorescence. We thus
selected two high fluorescence fusions, ompC and ompF,
and studied their regulation in rnc14 on western blots. The
cognate sRNAs, MicC and MicF, form extended duplexes
with these targets, which we considered as good RNase III
substrates. Furthermore, we have observed that MicC and
MicF accumulate to high levels in a Salmonella rnc14 strain
(Pfeiffer et al., unpublished data), which may indicate
impaired interaction with target mRNAs. However, we
observed that MicC/ompC and MicF/ompF regulation is as
effective in E.coli rnc14 as in the isogenic wild-type strain
(data not shown). Similarly, repression or activation was
not impaired by rnc14 for MicA/ompA, SgrS/ptsG, and
RyhB/sodB, or for RprA/rpoS, respectively (data not shown).

Assaying heterologous sRNA–target interactions
Few other bacteria in which sRNAs have been identified offer
as excellent genetic tools as E.coli to study regulation of
putative sRNA targets in vivo. However, in some cases
sRNAs of even distantly related species were shown to regu-
late their target upon co-expression in E.coli, e.g. lhtA RNA
of Chlamydia trachomatis (62). To test if we could use E.coli
as a host to assay heterologous sRNA/target pairs, we co-
expressed V.cholerae RyhB along with a sodB fusion derived
from this bacterium. RyhB/sodB regulation in V.cholerae was
previously suggested by (63). Interestingly, V.cholerae RyhB
(225 nt) is more than twice as long as E.coli RyhB
(90 nt), and the two homologues show little similarity
except for the sodB interaction site (Figure 8A). Similarly,
the sodB 50-UTR differs substantially between the two bacte-
ria. Nonetheless, we found that Vibrio RyhB effectively
represses translation of both the Vibrio and the E.coli sodB
fusion (Figure 8B). Reciprocally, E.coli RyhB effectively
represses both the Vibrio and the E.coli sodB fusion.
Growth in microtiter plates
The experiments thus far described were carried out under
standard laboratory growth conditions, i.e. growth in culture
flasks with aeration. To test if specific regulation could also
be obtained in a set-up that is more suited for high-throughput
screening, we grew the ompC fusion strain co-transformed
with various sRNA plasmids in small culture volumes
(150 ml) overlayed with mineral oil in microtiter plates.
Following inoculation from single colonies, cell density and
fluorescence were monitored in 15 min intervals over a course
of 16 h (Figure 9A). Fluorescence increased almost linear
after an initial phase for all strains but MicC/ompC; fluores-
cence of the latter remained almost constant throughout and
only increased slightly towards the end of the assay. Specific
ompC repression by MicC is observed early in growth, and
increases to 7-fold at the end of the assay (Figure 9B).
Taken together, although the degree of ompC regulation is
about one third as compared to culture in laboratory flasks
(Figure 3A), this microtiter plate-based assay provides the
same specificity.
DISCUSSION
We have studied sRNA-mediated control of mRNA targets
by using translational fusions to gfp, encoding a non-invasive
reporter of bacterial gene expression (64,65). We have
observed faithful regulation of target fusions with all
sRNA/target pairs whose interactions had previously been
dissected at the molecular level. Of these, several had been
tested by fusions to other reporter genes. Our results show
that the GFP fusions constructed here perform at least equally
well in terms of sRNA regulation. For example, 8-fold
activation of an rpoS::lacZ fusion was observed upon DsrA
overexpression (25,26), whereas overexpressed MicA caused
a 6-fold decrease in the activity of an ompA::lacZ reporter
gene (17). The corresponding regulation of rpoS::gfp and
ompA::gfp (Figures 3A and 5B) perfectly match these previ-
ous results. Interestingly, MicC repressed a translational

corrected for the autofluorescence of an E.coli strain carrying control plasmids pXG-0 and pJV300. (B) Factor of ompC fusion regulation by sRNAs (relative to
the control plasmid pJV300, calculated as in Figure 3A) at five selected growth stages (OD600* of 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3). Black bars indicate ompC
repression, whereas gray bars ompC activation.

ompC fusion to luciferase 2.5-fold (16), whereas >20-fold
repression of ompC::gfp was observed here (Figure 3A).
While other inhibitory sRNA/target interactions, i.e. RyhB/
sodB, DsrA/hns, MicF/ompF, Spot42/galK and SgrS/ptsG,
were previously validated by in vitro complex formation,
the fusions used here independently confirm that sRNA-
mediated mRNA repression occurs in the 50-UTR.
Several cases merit further discussion. First, repression of
hns mRNA by DsrA was proposed to involve two RNA
duplexes with 13 nt at the hns RBS and with 11 nt upstream
of the hns stop codon, in effect leading to a circularization of
hns mRNA (23). Although our hns::gfp fusion included the
13 nt RBS target region only, it was still subject to 7-fold
regulation by DsrA (Figure 3A). Thus, our system may report
regulation even if only partial target sequences are included
in a fusion. Second, a chromosomal gcvB deletion was previ-
ously shown to elevate expression of a dppA::lacZ fusion but
it remained unclear if GcvB acted on the cloned dppA mRNA
fragment or regulated dppA transcription (51). Our results
obtained with a dppA::gfp fusion strongly suggest that
GcvB post-transcriptionally regulates dppA by targeting its
mRNA in the 50-UTR (Figure 3A). This has also been
confirmed by biochemical analyses of the GcvB interaction
site on the dppA mRNA (C. M. Sharma, F. Darfeuille and
J. Vogel, manuscript in preparation). Similarly, a GcvB target
site was predicted in the dppA RBS region in biocompu-
tational analyses (30). Third, Wagner and Darfeuille (66)
evaluated the free energy values (DG) of several confirmed
sRNA/target duplexes as well as near-cognate and non-
cognate combinations, and found that DG values are rarely
good predictors of unknown target interactions. For example,
some cognate combinations, such as RyhB/sodB and
RprA/rpoS were predicted to have DG values of 17 and
24 kcal/mol1, respectively, but the values for near-cognate
combinations such as MicC/ompF and MicF/ompC were
similarly low (19.3 and 20.9 kcal/mol1, respectively).
Although the latter may indicate cross-regulation of ompF
and ompC by MicC and MicF, respectively, no such regula-
tion is seen with our GFP fusions (Figure 3A). This is of par-
ticular interest since many sRNAs target RBS regions which
by default have lower sequence complexity than other mRNA
parts (because of interaction with 16S rRNA). However, our
data indicate that this lower complexity does not seem to
compromise specificity.
By developing a specialized vector to clone fusions to
intra-operonic target sites, we were able to mimic discoordi-
nate expression of the galETKM operon as mediated by
Spot42. In addition, the inclusion of an upstream fusion to
the artificial FlacZ0 gene appeared to greatly enhance fusion
mRNA translation or stability, resulting in a detectable activ-
ity of an sdhD fusion. Using this vector, we have meanwhile
identified more polycistronic mRNAs that are subject to dis-
coordinate regulation by E.coli sRNAs (J. H. Urban and
J. Vogel, unpublished data). Although we failed to detect
RyhB regulation of an sdhD fusion (Figure 6C) this does
not call the sdhCDAB operon as a RyhB target into question.
Parallel probing of the chromosomal sdhCDAB mRNA
confirmed downregulation of this target mRNA by RyhB
(Figure 6D) as previously shown by (20). Moreover, other
results from our lab obtained for Salmonella RyhB regulation
strongly support sdhD as a RyhB target (unpublished data).
Hence, the lack of sdhCD fusion repression hints at additional
determinants of this regulation. For example, RyhB targeting
may require additional residues or an Hfq binding site of the
sdhCDAB mRNA that are located outside of the cloned
122 bp fragment, or an unknown protein factor that associates
with the native sdhCDAB transcript but not with the sdhCD
fusion mRNA.
While sRNA–target complexes have been extensively stud-
ied in vitro, less is known about the factors that contribute to
regulation in vivo. Most of the sRNAs studied here require
the bacterial RNA chaperone, Hfq, for target interaction
in vitro. However, since many sRNAs also fail to accumulate
in hfq mutant strains because of largely reduced stability, the
contribution of Hfq to sRNA target annealing in vivo is hard
to assess. In contrast, sRNA overexpression as shown here
(Figure 7B and Table 3) may provide a better means to evalu-
ate an involvement of Hfq in sRNA function in vivo. For
example, we found DsrA/hns regulation to be abrogated in
Dhfq cells although plasmid-borne dsrA and the hns fusion
were expressed normally. Thus this system could be used to
study possible defects of Hfq-dependent ribonucleoprotein
complex (RNP) formation or ribosome association of the
two RNAs.
RNase E-based RNPs, either containing other degradosome
components or Hfq, were recently implicated in translational
repression and decay of the ptsG and sodB mRNAs in vivo
(13,60). We have studied the regulation of ptsG, sodB and
other target gene fusions in an rne701 mutant strain that can-
not assemble either of these RNPs because of the C-terminal
RNase E truncation (Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure
S2). Surprisingly, fusion regulation was found to be almost
as effective as in the wild-type background. Although over-
expression likely results in a stoichiometry that is different
from that of chromosomally expressed sRNA and targets,
we still expected to see some effect of the rne mutation.
Nonetheless, our results were in better keeping with a more
recent report showing that sRNA-mediated repression of the
ptsG and sodB mRNAs in rne701 cells does occur at the level
of translation inspite of the defect in mRNA degradation (67).
However, there are important differences between the experi-
ments described by Morita et al. (67) and our experimental
set-up. In the former case, the ptsG and sodB mRNA decay
defects in rne701 cells were most apparent upon short-term
induction of the regulatory sRNA genes, which may be closer
to studying the natural kinectics of sRNA-mediated gene
silencing in the absence of native RNase E (67). In contrast,
the experiments described here report on steady-state levels
of target (fusion) mRNAs and proteins. Similar to (67) we
find that upon extended SgrS expression, the ptsG target
mRNA is effectively degraded in the rne701 cells, too,
and we observe the same effect on fusion mRNA decay for
four other target mRNAs, i.e. hns, sodB, ompC and ompF.
However, while the ompA fusion mRNA is fully degraded
upon MicA overexpression in wild-type cells, it fails to get
depleted when MicA is expressed in rne701 cells. That this
can be seen upon long-term sRNA expression makes the
MicA-ompA pair an attractive model to study the contribution
of RNase E to sRNA-mediated control of target mRNAs.
Although an RNase E-homologue is found in many
bacteria (68), neither its RNA recognition sequences nor
its ability to form RNPs are known to be conserved. Since
1034 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 3
overexpressed sRNAs regulate their targets largely indepen-
dent of RNase E-based RNPs, we expect that E.coli will be
a suitable host for the validation of putative sRNA/target
pairs from remotely related bacteria. Here we demonstrated
the regulatory capacity of such a heterologous sRNA/target
pair, i.e. Vibrio RyhB/sodB, while others recently used
E.coli as a host to show translational control of a C.trachoma-
tis sRNA/target pair (62).
The double-strand specific RNase III was shown to act
on E.coli sRNAs (2,69), and to cleave IstR RNA and its target
upon interaction (14). The ideal RNase III substrate is a >20 bp
full duplex (equivalent to about two turns of A-form dsRNA).
However, considerably shorter and/or imperfect duplexes
were also shown to be substrates [e.g. (70,71)]. Since MicC
and MicF form extended duplexes with their targets ompC
and ompF, respectively, we chose to study the regulation of
ompC/F fusions in an RNase III-deficient strain. No differ-
ence in ompC/F repression was found in this strain as com-
pared to wild-type E.coli, suggesting that the formed
duplexes are no substrates of RNase III, or that inhibition
of translation initiation is sufficient for regulation.
Taken together, our translational GFP fusion approach
offers a rapid and reliable tool to study sRNA control of
targets that are derived from both monocistronic and poly-
cistronic mRNAs. GFP was previously used by others as
a reporter of translational control to engineer artificial ribo-
regulators (72); the major difference to our approach being
that the RNA regulator and its target were expressed from
the same plasmid. However, we believe that our two-plasmid
system is better suited to meet the requirements of larger
screens because of the ease with which already existing
sRNA and fusion plasmids can be combined. Similar two-
plasmid systems with lacZ reporter genes were successfully
used to study interactions of cis-encoded antisense RNAs
with their targets [e.g. (73)].
The results presented here encourage further work to
improve and refine our methodology. First, although fusions
with low GFP activity can be easily assayed on Western
blots, the use of gfp alleles with increased fusion fluorescence
will facilitate screening approaches. While this work was in
progress, a new GFP variant, superfolder GFP, with brighter
fluorescence and higher tolerance of fusion partners was
described (74). Preliminary results from our lab suggest that
this variant enhances the activity of some of the fusions
described here (unpublished data). Second, the vast majority
of the sRNA targets sites known to date are located in mRNA
50 regions. In contrast, E.coli GadY sRNA overlaps in anti-
sense orientation with the 30 end of its target mRNA (27).
Since GFP tolerates fusion to its carboxy terminus, it should
be possible to adapt our approach to studying sRNA interac-
tions with the 30 end of target mRNAs. Third, many target
mRNAs encode proteins that are exported to the periplasm
or which integrate into membranes. We have thus far avoided
inclusion of signal sequences to ensure cytoplasmic localiza-
tion of the gfp fusions. Recent work from the Aiba lab, how-
ever, showed that membrane localization of the native ptsG
mRNAs is required for its repression by SgrS (49). It will
thus be interesting to determine how the inclusion of extracy-
toplasmic signal sequences affects regulation of a fusion
by its cognate sRNA. Fourth, GFP as a reporter that does
not require a chromogenic substrate allows studying gene
regulation at the single-cell level. Several recent studies
have shown considerable heterogeneity of transcriptional
responses within bacterial populations [e.g. (75,76)]. Whether
this also holds true for post-transcriptional processes could be
determined using the reporter system described here. On this
line, preliminary results with our rpoS::gfp fusion indicate
that co-expression of DsrA or RprA results in bacterial popu-
lations that can be separated from control strains by high-
speed flow cytometry (unpublished data).
Small non-coding RNAs have been discovered at a stag-
gering rate in E.coli and many other eubacteria (1,77–83).
Given the hundreds of sRNAs of unknown function, target
identification has become a pressing issue but has been
lagging behind, mainly due to an incomplete understanding
of molecular rules for sRNA/target pairing. Although a first
algorithm for target prediction has been implemented and
even suggested additional targets for hitherto well-studied
sRNAs (30), it has created rather than obviated the need for
rapid and independent methods to validate the increasing
numbers of predicted targets by independent methods. We
believe that GFP-based reporters as the ones constructed
here will be particularly useful when having to test larger
numbers of predicted sRNA targets.
