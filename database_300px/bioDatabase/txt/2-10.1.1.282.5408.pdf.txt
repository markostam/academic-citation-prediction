ABSTRACT
Understanding how genetic variation affects the
molecular function of gene products is an emergent
area of bioinformatic research. Here, we present
updates to MutDB (http://www.mutdb.org), a tool
aiming to aid bioinformatic studies by integrating
publicly available databases of human genetic
variation with molecular features and clinical
phenotype data. MutDB, first developed in 2002,
integrates annotated SNPs in dbSNP and amino acid
substitutions in Swiss-Prot with protein structural
information, links to scores that predict functional
disruption and other useful annotations. Though
these functional annotations are mainly focused on
nonsynonymous SNPs, some information on other
SNP types included in dbSNP is also provided.
Additionally, we have developed a new functionality
that facilitates KEGG pathway visualization of genes
containing SNPs and a SNP query tool for visualizing
and exporting sets of SNPs that share selected
features based on certain filters.
INTRODUCTION
Understanding how coding single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (cSNPs) and disease-associated mutations cause
molecular alterations and expression changes in gene
products is important to many ﬁelds of biological and
medical research (1,2). We believe that linking disease with
basic research data will enable hypothesis generation that
can be experimentally tested in the laboratory with
functional assays.
Recently, several servers and databases aiming to
understand the biochemical eﬀects of nonsynonymous
SNPs and disease-associated mutation have been devel-
oped. These include SIFT (3), PolyPhen (4), SNPs3D (5),
PANTHER (6), PMUT (7), LS-SNP (8), PolyDoms (9)
and SNPEﬀect (10). These methods and their resulting
datasets generally apply DNA and protein sequence,
protein structure and/or evolutionary features to classify
a query amino acid substitution using a training set of
putative neutral and causative amino acid substitutions
(4,5,8,11–17).
Similarly, MutDB (18,19) is an online resource that
serves as a step toward better understanding the potential
molecular eﬀects of a mutation. MutDB integrates genetic
variation from two public databases, Swiss-Prot (20) and
dbSNP (21), and annotates the variants with biochemi-
cally relevant information. These two databases are
chosen because they are freely available and represent
a signiﬁcant breadth of available amino acid substitutions.
However, neither of these databases annotates disease
causing amino acid substitutions particularly well. dbSNP
contains few links to OMIM (22), and Swiss-Prot does not
identify disease causing amino acid substitutions from
other amino acid substitutions. Therefore, a researcher
studying a speciﬁc disease should have some prior
knowledge of the proteins and mutations of interest, and
MutDB provides some helpful links to useful databases
with disease and phenotype annotations such as OMIM
and dbGAP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez
?db=gap), (22).
In addition to updating to the latest mutation and SNP
datasets, here we present several additions to the MutDB
resource. First, we have developed a pathway visualization
add-on to MutDB that leads the biologist from mutations
in a gene to KEGG (23) biological pathways involving
the gene. This enables the researcher to view the systems
context of both a mutation and its associated phenotype.
Second, we have constructed an AJAX (Asynchronous

JavaScript and XML) based SNP query tool that allows
users to save searches, view Haploview-like haplotype
structure (24), and select subsets of SNPs based
on frequencies and SNP scores. Together these tools
represent a useful addition to our existing library of
genetic research tools (Figure 1).
METHODS AND USAGE
Web interface and data organization
The SNP and mutation data is parsed directly from
Swiss-Prot (currently build 51.0) and dbSNP (currently
build 126) without curation, other than to remove
any annotations that do not map to the wild-type amino
acid in the referenced sequence. The gene model provided
by MutDB is organized, using gene information
extracted from a local copy of the UCSC Human
Genome Annotation Database (ver. Hg18, http://geno
me.ucsc.edu/) (25). We also use Ensembl (ver. 41_36c,
http://www.ensembl.org/) (26) for some gene name cross-
references. We attempt to keep pages organized by Entrez
Gene ID with the most representative transcript as
the primary gene page. Other known mRNA transcripts
annotated in the UCSC Genome Annotation Database
are listed at the bottom of the page with their annotations.
This data may be browsed alphabetically by gene symbol
or by employing one of several search methods, including
keyword, gene symbol, protein or Refseq ID, and
individual variant identiﬁer. Each gene is given its own
page for display, providing a list of related SNPs and
mutations classiﬁed by their eﬀects on the protein product,
as well as a pictorial representation of the sequence
including points of conservation, location of exons and
location of variants. Links to corresponding Swiss-Prot
and dbSNP pages, a short description of the gene, and the
related chromosome name are supplied.
Each variant is annotated within its own page providing
further details, which includes the protein sequence,
if known, and any related Protein Data Bank (PDB)
Figure 1. SNP query tool snapshot highlighting SNP ﬁltering. Multiple ﬁltering options include: validation (T/F), HapMap (31) (T/F),
Location, avHet, avHetSE, HapMap Frequency (CEU, CHB, JPT, YRI), SIFT score and UCSC conservation. Users can preview current ﬁltering
criteria by scrolling over pop-up window link. Once SNPs are selected, Haploview like images can be rendered showing HapMap LD structure
(lower right).

(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) (27) structures, KEGG
Pathways, HapMap data and Entrez Gene information.
We describe important aspects of our annotation pipeline
below.
Protein structure annotations
Protein structural mapping for each amino acid substitu-
tion is performed by aligning the query sequence to each
high scoring segment pair (HSP) from BLAST (28) search
results using BioPerl scripts (29). BLAST results used
for alignment come only from PDB (using a sequence data
ﬁle downloaded in January of 2007) and are limited
to those with 100% identity to the original sequence.
These pairwise alignments are then used to map wild-type
and mutation sequence to structure sequence.
The annotated mutations that are mapped to a structure
can be displayed using the integrated Jmol visualization
tool (http://jmol.sourceforge.net/) or in extensions devel-
oped for UCSF Chimera (30) and Delano Scientiﬁc
PyMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net/). To download
the extensions visit http://lifescienceweb.org/.
Function annotations
We provide links to other tools that provide predictions
of functional or molecular disruptions caused by an amino
acid substitution. These include SNPs3D (5), PolyPhen
(4), SIFT (3), PolyDoms (9), PMUT (7) and PANTHER
(6) and are deep linked directly to the gene or SNP page,
if available. Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT)
scores (3) and their associated predictions are supplied for

each variant causing an amino acid substitution. Variants
with low conﬁdence scores are marked with an asterisk.
Here, again, the source Swiss-Prot and dbSNP pages
are linked.
Visualization on KEGG pathways
We have augmented MutDB annotations with KEGG
pathways using KEGG web services (23). This enables
visualizing proteins, mutations and pathways on approxi-
mately 188 human pathways found in KEGG. The
addition of a link, ‘Visualize Pathways’, on the MutDB
gene page takes the user to a page listing the names of all
KEGG pathways involving the gene. When a pathway is
chosen, the user is taken to a new page displaying
the pathway and a list of involved genes and their
associated phenotypes.
All genes containing a SNP denoted as having a disease
annotation or comment (per Swiss-Prot) are colored
yellow in the pathway. This page is also hyper-linked to
KEGG and MutDB. This functionality makes use
of KEGG SOAP-based web services with supplementary
data saved locally (Figure 2).
SNP query tool
A recent addition to our toolset is a SNP query tool that
enables querying and exporting sets of SNPs that share
selected features. The SNP query tool requires two
sequence-tagged site (STS) markers or dbSNP reference
cluster IDs (rs#) as input and returns all SNPs between
the markers. The tool uses AJAX and a paging scheme to
increase responsiveness upon large data sets. AJAX
enhances speed by exchanging small amounts of data
with the server, so the entire web page need not be
reloaded each time the user makes a change. This
technique along with the broad ﬁltering options provide
for an interactive tool.
Users may ﬁlter SNPs by manual selection or one of the
ﬁltering criteria. There are currently eleven ﬁlter options:
validation status in dbSNP, hapmap status, location
(functional class), avHet (average heterozygosity in
dbSNP), avHetSE (SE for the average heterozygosity in
dbSNP), CEU (CEPH—Utah residents with ancestry
from northern and western Europe frequencies in
HapMap), CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China),
JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan), YRI (Yoruba in
Ibadan, Nigeria), SIFT score (3) and conservation score
[based on the UCSC Genome Annotation Database
conservation (25)]. The conservation score is the averaged
10-mer window of conservation values around each
SNP derived from alignments of the 16 vertebrate species
in the UCSC Annotated Genome Database.
A user can authenticate to enter the tool or visit as
a guest, and may save each session and return later.
Retrieval of sequence surrounding the SNP and exporta-
tion of SNP data to Microsoft Excel are easily performed
via provided links. Excel output includes the dbSNP rsID,
primer sequences, and the polymorphic alleles. The tool
displays a PNG image containing RefSeq transcript
information and location information for all selected
SNPs indexed by function type using the UCSC Genome
Annotation Database. A user may also visualize linkage
disequilibrium for up to 200 selected SNPs in a Haploview
(24) like structure. The SNP query tool is located at http://
www.mutdb.org/snp and is linked from each page
(Figure 1).
Continued web services support
MutDB continues to support its SOAP-based web
services. The web services can be accessed via http://
www.lifescienceweb.org. This interface is used to commu-
nicate to the structural visualization extensions for UCSF
Chimera and Delano Scientiﬁc PyMOL.
Most accessed gene pages
In MutDB, the most accessed genes may give insight into
the current interests of researchers. The most accessed
genes from October 2005 to January 2007 are listed in
Table 1. Not surprisingly, the most accessed genes also
have many mutations associated with them and are what
we would consider to be well-studied disease-associated
genes.
Future
Understanding the underlying molecular causes of disease
remains an important area for research. We continue to
investigate annotations that are useful for hypothesis
generation and directing experimental validation. While
we continue to update the database as new annotations
become available, we are also adding useful annotations
outside of protein amino acid changes such as noncoding,
synonymous and intronic variation.
