ABSTRACT
Farm animal genomics is of interest to a wide audi-
ence of researchers because of the utility derived from
understanding how genomics and proteomics func-
tion in various organisms. Applications such as xeno-
transplantation, increased livestock productivity,
bioengineering new materials, products and even fab-
rics are several reasons for thriving farm animal gen-
ome activity. Currently mined in rapidly growing data
warehouses, completed genomes of chicken, fish and
cows are available but are largely stored in decentral-
ized data repositories. In this paper, we provide an
informatics primer on farm animal bioinformatics
and genome project resources which drive attention
to the most recent advances in the field. We hope to
provide individuals in biotechnology and in the farm-
ing industry with information on resources and
updates concerning farm animal genome projects.
PRELUDE
The omics and bioinformatics
Genomics is the scientific study of structure, function and
interrelationships of both individual genes and the genome
in its entirety (1). The field has evolved from identifying
short nucleotide strings of DNA to the sequencing of an
organism’s complete genome. Current progress in genomics
research has facilitated comprehensive mapping of the build-
ing blocks of biology (2). Ultimately, researchers hope to gain
mastery over the fundamental description of cellular function
at the DNA level (3). This would encompass gene regulation,
in which proteins often regulate their own production or that of
other proteins in a complex web of interactions. Databases can
be developed to provide solutions to problems that people
encounter when dealing with massive amounts of data. How-
ever, the abundance and growing complexity of the data tools
and resources required for analysis are overwhelming (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/bioinformatics.html). The
same is true of researchers focusing on the study of
function and structure of proteins and protein–protein
interactions.
Proteomics, or the science of protein structure and function,
is now a hot spot in biomedicine. A key component to the next
revolution in the ‘post-genomic’ era will be the increasingly
widespread use of protein structure in rational experimental
design. New computational methodologies now yield structure
models that are, in many cases, quantitatively comparable to
crystal structures, at a fraction of the cost (4). The technical
challenge is the complete coverage of physicochemical prop-
erties for thousands of proteins (5). Thus, by analytically
investigating genes and proteins, researchers have developed
the umbrella study of bioinformatics, the science of analyzing
biological data using cutting-edge computing techniques.
Bioinformatics deals with methods for storing, retrieving
and analyzing biological data, such as nucleic acid (DNA/
RNA) and protein sequences, structures, functions, pathways
and genetic interactions: the computational management of all
kinds of biological information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
About/primer/bioinformatics.html). Rather than merely a
mixture of computer science, data management and genome
sciences, Bioinformatics now encompasses both con-
ceptual and practical tools for the propagation, generation,
processing and understanding of scientific ideas and biological
information (6).
DNA and protein sequences data banks
The availability of many complete genome sequences from
different species can bring insight into the function of con-
served non-coding regions of DNA sequence (7). Organization
of the data into coding (genes) and non-coding sequences, in
addition to organizing these data into databases for ‘DNA
databases’ and proteins (Table 1), is central for bioinformatics
(6,8,9). Parsing the sequence of DNA or protein is a first step,
followed by curation then analysis and sometimes re-curation
based on the analysis. The presence of these databases and
derivative search engines gave rise to programs, such as
FASTA (10) and PSI-BLAST (11), which are DNA and
protein sequence analysis tools, respectively (12). These
tools facilitate searches for sequences that resemble one
another and homologous relationship inferences. Utilization

of similarity search programs, which operate on sequences, has
helped in augmenting annotated databases, which house
information about sequence domains. Information recording,
retrieval and cataloging continue to advance further
database capabilities (13). Collaborating research centers,
particularly in the US, Japan and the UK, have been actively
collecting sequence data and making it accessible to public
(14) (Table 1).
Farm animals: an unexploited gold mine for biotech
Farm animals are quite valuable as resources, often notable as
models for pathology and physiology studies. Magnussen (15)
discusses how a variety of these farm animal models are used.
The reproductive physiology of farm animals is more similar
to humans than that of rodents because farm animals have
longer gestation and pre-pubertal periods than mice (16). Spe-
cific farm animal physiology, such as the digestive system of
the pig is similar to that of humans (17). These attributes of
farm animals reveal that they are an unparalleled resource for
research replicating human physiological function (15).
For decades, breeders have altered the genomes of farm
animals by first searching for desired phenotypic traits and
then selecting for superior animals to continue their lineage
into the next generation (18). This genomic work has already
facilitated a reduction in genetic disorders in farm animals, as
many disease carriers are removed from breeding populations
by purifying selection (19). By studying diverse phenotypes

over time, researchers can now monitor mutations that occur
as wild species become domesticated (20). Farm animal food
safety will remain a concern for some time; however, advance-
ments such as the discovery of Escherichia coli resistant genes
in the pig (21) can mediate most of the problems. Moreover,
resources devoted to investigating the genomes of farm anim-
als can bring eventual economic benefits. For example, isola-
tion of DNA from animal tissue can be used as an inexpensive
method for tracking the origin of a meat sample, providing the
recipient with the quality assurance of that food (22).
2005: the year of the chicken
There has been significant interest in the first complete ana-
lysis of the draft genome sequence of the chicken. This
sequence has given rise to chicken genome array chips and
a number of web based mapping tools. The great importance of
the chicken as a scientific resource can be seen from the
research on avian leucosis virus, which has led to develop-
ments in the areas of proviral insertion-mediated oncogenesis
and vertebrate viral-host interactions (23,24). Still, many
chicken lines are being lost due to facility downsizing and
closings (http://www.grcp.ucdavis.edu/publications/doc20/
full.pdf).
The release of the first draft of the chicken genome in March
2004 spawned the current boom in chicken genomic research
(25) (Table 2). From an evolutionary standpoint, investigation
of the chicken genome will provide significant information
needed to understand the vertebrate genome evolution,
since the chicken is between the mammal and fish on the
evolutionary tree (26). Furthermore, the chicken remains sig-
nificant as a food animal which comprises 41% of the meat
produced in the world and serves as a reliable model for the
study of diseases and developmental biology (26). With this
sequenced genome, chicken breeders will have a framework
for investigating polymorphisms of informative quantitative
traits to continue their directed evolution of these species. The
chicken genome is also effective as a comparative genomic
tool that sheds additional light on various aspects of our own
genome (27). In addition, complementary DNA microarrays
for the chicken have already been produced for the study of
metabolic and other systemic processes (27,28).
The swine sequence
The sequencing of the pig genome generated an invaluable
resource for advancements in enzymology, reproduction,
endocrinology, nutrition and biochemistry research (29,30).
Since pigs are evolutionarily distinct to both humans and
rodents, but have co-evolved with these species, the diversity
of selected phenotypes make the pig a useful model for the
study of genetic and environmental interactions with poly-
genic traits (31). The sequencing of the pig genome is also
instrumental in the improvement of human health. Clinical
studies in areas such as infectious disease, organ transplanta-
tion, physiology, metabolic disease, pharmacology, obesity
and cardiovascular disease have used pig models (32)
(Table 3). In the near future, the sequencing of the porcine
genome will allow gene markers for specific diseases to be
identified, assisting breeders in generating pig stocks resistant
to infectious diseases (33). Furthermore, as researchers invest-
igate the swine genome and isolate genes that may impact
the economics of breeding, members of the commercial
pig industry are able to use this information to garner
benefits (30).
The Bos taurus genome
The mammalian order Cetartiodactyla (possessing B.taurus or
cattle) is of great interest since it represents a group of
eutherian mammals phylogenetically distant from primates
(34,35). Working with the cow species, B.taurus, is significant
because the cow is such an economically important animal.
This form of livestock makes up the beef and milk production
industry, which is one of the largest industries in the United
States. The identification of numerous single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) makes it possible for geneticists to find
associations between certain genes and cow traits that will
eventually lead to the production of superior-quality beef
(36). After the completion of the September 2004 B.taurus
draft assembly (Table 4), this genome has functioned as a
vehicle for studies on non-primate and non-rodent genomes
as well as in comparative genomics (37). Similar to the pig, the
cow also serves as a good animal model for obesity, infectious
diseases and female health (34,38).
Sheep (Ovis aries) genome project
Bioinformatics researchers from New Zealand, US, UK and
Australia have come together to work on the sheep genome
map. The focal point of interest in sheep is based on the quest to
maximize sheep meat and cotton wool production. This sector
of the corporate farming industry is so intent on this biotech-
nology project that AWI, Meat and Livestock Australia and
nine other partners are investing $50 million into the Sheep
Genome Project to ensure its completion (http://www.wool.
com.au/LivePage.aspx?pageId=116). As a resource in bio-
logical science, researchers have mapped a subset of genes
that have also been mapped in humans and mice (39). These
studies have revealed the existence of mutations that yield
phenotypes unique to the sheep, demonstrating that genetic
analysis of the sheep can enhance our knowledge of biological
pathways in other mammalian species (39,40). Table 5
provides information on current genome informatics resources
available on the Internet related to sheep.
The fish genome project
Fish are one of the most studied organisms. Researchers have
investigated the genome of zebrafish, medaka, pufferfish
(Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) and sticklebacks.
The zebrafish genome has attracted the attention of various
pharmaceutical and biotech companies owing to the ease
with which scientists can use this fish to study the gene func-
tion (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/genome/genesandbody/
hg05f006.html). The number of databases and informatics
resources related to fish genomic study on the Internet is
consistently growing (Table 6). Japanese researchers are inter-
ested in medakas from an evolutionary standpoint (40). Other
fish genome sequences, such as the pufferfish genome are
similar to the Fugu genome in size and are 7.5 times smaller
than the human genome. This has led many to believe that the
genes conserved between these two species would reveal the
minimal number of genes required for a vertebrate organism
(41). Further investigation of the Fugu genome supported this

hypothesis and showed the ability of the Fugu genome to aid
in the study of vertebrate functional non-coding sequences
(41). Other studies of fish have focused on the stickleback,
for its variable body shapes, ecology or its behavior (http://
www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/
SticklebackSEQ.pdf). In general, fish genomic work is of
interest to the commercial fish farming community. Based
on transgenic studies, antifreeze protein and fish

The forgotten rabbit
Little genomics attention is paid to rabbits in comparison
with other animal models, such as the mouse, rat and fruit
fly in the pre- and post-genomic era. However, experimental
models, such as the Alba or the ‘mighty lighting rabbit’, were
developed as glowing mutants that shine under special light
for commercial reasons. French scientists created Alba using
a process called zygote microinjection. In this process, the
scientists plucked a fluorescent protein from the fluorescent
jellyfish Aequorea victoria. Then, they modified the gene to
make its glowing properties twice as powerful. This gene,
called EGFG (enhanced green fluorescent gene, was then
inserted into a fertilized rabbit egg cell that eventually grew
into Alba (Amanda onion). Debates about the project itself
and about the practice of manipulating genes in animals
for research have quickly arisen in the research community.
The French National Institute of Agronomic Research
hesitated to release these rabbits owing to protests over its
development.
Chinese scientists have placed rabbit genes in cotton plants,
producing cotton fibers as bright and soft as rabbit hair but
stronger and warmer. This indicates not only the rise of the
rabbit in experimental models for genetics engineering, but
also for future medical experimentation models. Despite the
controversy that the ‘shining rabbit’ and the ‘cotton rabbit’
raised, it is clear that this type of genetic engineering is at an
early stage. Currently available sources of information about
the rabbit on the web can be seen in Table 7.
Farm animal genomics: current statistics
As researchers delve into the composition of farm animal
genome sequences, new functional and biological data
emerge. Table 8 is compiled from the Ensembl database
(http://www.ensembl.org/) and illustrates a summary of cur-
rent analysis on coding regions within genomes for selected
farm animals. For example, in the cow genome, 239 000
exon regions and just over 29 000 transcripts have been tallied
from among the 565 million bp found in the genome.
One of the major sources of information on farm animal
genomics is the ArkDB (43), which is available through the
Roslin Institute (UK) and Texas A&M University (USA). The
ArkDB provides detailed genomic mapping data on sheep,
chicken, cow and pig genomes (44), including data on PCR
primers, genetic linkage map assignments of specific loci and
markers, and cytogenetic map assignments. Information about
farm animals in this database is displayed in Table 9 and
provides a snapshot of current resources available for each
genome. Quantitative functional information, such as the num-
ber of clones, microsatellites and associated mapping assign-
ments, can lend insight into the complexity of the models
available. For example, the number of primers tabulated in
the swine genome currently far exceeds that known for the
cow, indicating more varieties of genes are available for study
in the swine. Much of this information remains at an early
stage and with increasing experimentation, compilation and
analysis, will be refined.

Expression sequence tags
Expression sequence tags (ESTs) are small pieces of cDNA
sequence (usually 200–500 nt long), which are useful as mark-
ers for a desired portion of RNA and DNA that can be used for
gene identification and positional mapping within a genome
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/est.html). The
NCBI provides the most comprehensive EST database for
many farm animals. Tabulation of chicken EST information,
including quantities of ESTs and their tissue sources can

be found in the BBSRC ChickEST Database (http://chick.
umist.ac.uk/) (45,46). ChickEST provides access to
339 000 Gallus ESTs, generated from 21 different embry-
onic and adult tissues. Cow EST information is available on
ArkDB, Ensembl (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/
map_search.cgi?taxid=9031) and the NCBI Cow genome
EST. A collection of pig ESTs is also available through the
pig EST database (http://pigest.genome.iastate.edu/index.
html) (47) in two versions. The first version contains
14 000 EST sequences obtained from porcine whole embryo,
term placenta, anterior pituitary, hypothalamus and ovary. The
second, newer version of the database accommodates 99 000
pig ESTs. Pig sequence homology comparisons can be readily
studied on the Iowa State University’s website. However,
database updates were carried out only until January 2002.
Among farm animals, there is sparse information about rabbit
ESTs. NCBI does not provide comprehensive EST informa-
tion, with virtually no physical maps on the rabbit. However,
NCBI is still the central source for information about rabbit
ESTs, mining 2275 GenBank rabbit ESTs (dbEST release
082605).
Physical mapping
Genome maps in livestock species have been under develop-
ment for the last decade. Mapping, which involves understand-
ing the relative distances between genes on a chromosome,
has been performed for the many farm animals. The NCBI
provide comprehensive mapping information for many farm
animal species. Mapping information is available at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=?,
with specific animal links available by substituting the ‘?’ sign
in the previous URL with the species’ taxonomic number, such
as 9031 for the chicken, 9913 for the cow, 9823 for the pig,
7955 for the zebrafish and 9940m for the sheep. For example,
the chicken mapping site can be found at NCBI MapView
website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.
cgi?taxid=9031). The US Livestock Species Genome Projects
(http://www.animalgenome.org/) suggest using ArkDB
(mentioned above), for mapping information on farm animals.
The Laboratory of Biochemistry and Cytogenetics (Jouy-in-
Josas, France) at the National Institute for Agricultural
Research (INRA) provides the rabbit ‘Lepine’ genome
mapping database (http://dga.jouy.inra.fr/cgi-bin/lgbc/main.
pl?BASE=rabbit). The database provides access to informa-
tion about rabbit genomic information which includes so far
410 loci with 1327 homologue loci on 129 species, 21 poly-
morphisms, 314 genes and their physical location on chromo-
somes. Other information about primers, probes and enzymes
are also included. Genes in the RabbitMap database are hyper-
linked to a separate page that provides locus information.
Physical mapping of the zebrafish is available through the
Ensemble database at http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/
index.html. The Ensemble database also provides a compre-
hensive map viewer for zebrafish and the chicken (http://www.
ensembl.org/Gallus_gallus/index.html). High-resolution maps
for sheep chromosomes are available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/genome/guide/sheep/index.html.
Quantitative trait loci and genetic linkage
One of the primary challenges in modern biology is the under-
standing of the genetic basis of phenomic diversity within and
among species (20). The foundation for this diversity lies in
genetic governance of both how traits are expressed and the
associated linkage maps. Genes mapped in some farm animals
serve as ‘anchors’ across the comparative maps of other spe-
cies (39). Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) play a major role in
farm animals and the related biotechnology industry, as they
can further the identification of traits related to meat and milk
production. A number of studies have been conducted to detect
QTLs that can be used for determining gene variances (48,49).
The third generation of sheep linkage map (50) contains 1062
loci (941 anonymous loci and 121 genes) and is a compilation
of genotype data generated by 15 laboratories using the IMF
population (http://rubens.its.unimelb.edu.au/~jillm/jill.htm).
The ArkDB provides current summaries of linkage and cyto-
genetic map assignments, polymorphic marker details, PCR
primers and two point linkage data (see Table 9). The ArkDB
also is a major source for mapped sheep loci, with SheepBase
containing almost 1500 loci. The Roslin Institute has
developed the ‘resSpecies’ (http://www.reSpecies.org/) data-
base to study genetic linkage maps, QTLs, alleles and other
markers (44,51). Bovine QTL databases are available from
several sources (52,53). Various traits, such as milk yield
and composition, are available along with QTL dot maps,
which provide varied positional and statistical information.
The pig QTL (http://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/)
includes two release versions from NCBI in May 2004 and
from NAGRP in December 2004. The pig QTL database, or
pig QTLdb, contains all published pig QTL data from the past
decade. The user can locate genes responsible for quantitative
traits central to pig production. To date, 791 QTLs from 73
publications, representing 219 different traits are incorporated
into the database in the first release and 1129 QTLs, from 86
publications representing 235 different traits in the second
release. The project also provides maps at http://www.
animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/viewmap and links to the
NCBI pig EST Map database (http://pigest.genome.iastate.
edu/index.html).
FARM ANIMAL GENOMICS: THE LEGAL SIDE
Genome protections: lessons from the human genome
Similar to other areas of scientific research, the field of farm
animal genomics is ingrained with various issues requiring

ethical consideration. Although a number of gene-based
technological advances, such as the prediction of illnesses
or adverse drug response are beneficial for commercial
interests (54), many look to protect how genetic information
is used. The corollary in human genomics is the recent
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005 (http://
www.genome.gov/PolicyEthics/). This bill, which is pending
in the US Congress, prohibits among other things ‘a health
insurance issuer from: adjusting premiums on the basis of
genetic information’ (http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/
z?d109:SN00306:@@@L&summ2=m&). Concerns over
such actions reveal the understanding by the US government
that the use of human genomic data must be closely regulated
in order to hinder any commercial abuses. Although genetic
discrimination and health insurance might not be issues rel-
evant to farm animal genomics, a great need exists to establish
a similar legal framework for farm animals in order to ensure
the proper use of farm animal genomic information.
Genome policies for transgenic animals
The federal government’s role as a legal authority for protect-
ing the environment from scientifically introduced transgenic
organisms has not been clearly outlined (55). This underscores
the need for greater governmental attention to address legal
problems that will arise as animal biotechnology continues to
grow. Many argue that it is not only a moral imperative
to respect the intrinsic sentience of animals but also a legal
one (http://www.foodethicscouncil.org/library/consultations/
BBSRCgenomics.pdf). The European Union’s Treaty of
Amsterdam states that animals must be treated humanely,
as sentient beings, which some argue implies respect for
their intrinsic nature and protection against such infringements
of that respect in studies such as transgenic animal experi-
ments (http://www.eurotreaties.com/amsterdamtext.html).
Furthermore, US food regulatory agencies, such as the United
States Department of Agriculture and the Food Safety and
Inspection Service, charged with the duty of making sure
that transgenic animals anticipated for human consumption
are correctly labeled and wholesome, have already moved
forward to institute policies regulating the slaughtering
of non-transgenic animals created from transgenic animal
experiments (56).
Ethical reservations of farm animal genomic study
As farm animal species continue to be sequenced (one of
the latest being the cow, B.taurus), farming companies are
using this information to perform genetic profiles of tradition-
ally bred animals and to genetically engineer or clone other
animals (57). Although many farmers may enjoy access to
greater genetic resources, animal rights organizations
oppose the use of animals such as transgenic goats that
produce silk proteins used to make Biosteel fibers because
of the allegedly inhumane treatment of animals during
these studies (58). Proponents of such experiments point to
the ability of transgenic mouse mammary glands to assemble
and secrete recombinant human fibrinogen (59). These studies
raise many concerns about research ethics and species
integrity (60,61).
The potential of farm animal genomics
Farm animal genomic studies continue to attract audiences
excited by the multitude of applications (62). The meat indus-
try can now use cow and chicken genomic data to confirm the
quality of meat products. For example, meat producers can
now confirm the parentage of an Angus cattle breed by per-
forming a genetic blood test or attempt to identify the SNPs
associated with high-quality beef (57). Other companies are
using genomic information to determine disease-resistant
genes in shrimp and then are selectively mating the shrimp
that carry them in order to create disease resistant strains (57).
In the healthcare arena, farm animal genomic work will aid in
enterprises such as xenotransplantation (the transfer of animal
tissues or organs into humans). Though animal organs may be
used someday to satiate organ donor shortage, genomic work
in this area is still in its early stage (63). Many of the
immediate practical applications of farm animal genomics
show potential for growth in this field.
