ABSTRACT
Yeast ribosomal protein L10 (E. coli L16) is located
at the center of a topological nexus that connects
many functional regions of the large subunit. This
essential protein has previously been implicated in
processes as diverse as ribosome biogenesis,
translational fidelity and mRNA stability. Here, the
inability to maintain the yeast Killer virus was used
as a proxy for large subunit defects to identify a
series of L10 mutants. These mapped to roughly
four discrete regions of the protein. A detailed ana-
lysis of mutants located in the N-terminal ‘hook’ of
L10, which inserts into the bulge of 25S rRNA helix
89, revealed strong effects on rRNA structure corre-
sponding to the entire path taken by the tRNA 3’ end
as it moves through the large subunit during the
elongation cycle. The mutant-induced structural
changes are wide-ranging, affecting ribosome bio-
genesis, elongation factor binding, drug resistance/
hypersensitivity, translational fidelity and virus main-
tenance. The importance of L10 as a potential trans-
ducer of information through the ribosome, and of a
possible role of its N-terminal domain in switching
between the pre- and post-translocational states
are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine that
orchestrates multiple reactions in a highly coordinated
manner. Although atomic level ribosome structures
reveal the topologies of the functional centers, how these
exchange information and coordinate their activities
remains an active ﬁeld of inquiry. For example, during
the translation elongation cycle the ribosome must
sequentially bind EF-Tuaa-tRNAGTP (ternary com-
plex or TC; in eukaryotes the elongation factor is called
‘eEF1A’), stimulate GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu, accommo-
date aa-tRNA into the large subunit, eﬀect peptidyltrans-
fer, bind EF-G (eEF2 in eukaryotes), again stimulate GTP
hydrolysis by EF-G and translocate along the mRNA by
one codon. The TC and EF-G are structurally similar (1),
and there is a large degree of overlap between their ribo-
some binding sites. In yeast, for example, eEF2 contacts
the a-sarcin-ricin loop (SRL, H95 of 25S rRNA), the
GTPase-associated center (GAC composed of ribosomal
protein L12, H43, H44), Helices 33, 34, 69 and 89, ribo-
somal proteins L9, L12 and the P proteins (P0, P1a, P1b,
P2a, P2b) on the large ribosomal subunit, while it also
interacts with many elements of the small subunit includ-
ing h5, h15, h33, h34, h44 in the head and body domains,
and with ribosomal protein S23 (2). The interactions
between these factors and the ribosome were initially char-
acterized using chemical footprinting methods (3). A cryo-
electron microscopy study of the TC stalled on an
Escherichia coli 70S ribosome with kirromycin revealed a
similarly complex set of interactions that included the
SRL and the GAC on the large subunit (4).
We have been using a yeast-based system to dissect how
the ribosome coordinates TC binding, aa-tRNA accom-
modation, peptidyltransfer and eEF2 binding. Molecular
genetics and biochemical studies using mutant rRNAs and
ribosomal proteins are identifying important elements and
allosteric rearrangements involved in these processes (5–
11). These studies have led us to focus on structural ele-
ments in the vicinity of the ‘accommodation corridor’, a
passageway located along the interface between H89 and
the H90–H92 structure of the large subunit rRNA (12).
Previously, we demonstrated the involvement of a central
extension of ribosomal protein L3 in coordinating TC,
eEF2 binding and peptidyltransfer by helping to open
and close this structure (9).
Ribosomal protein L3 is located on the H90–H92 side
of the accommodation corridor. Examination of this

region reveals that another ribosomal protein, L10 (L16 in
E. coli and L10e in Haloarcula marismortui) is located on
the H89 side of the corridor. L10 extends from the solvent
accessible side near the factor-binding site down toward
the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) in the core of the
large subunit. The N-terminal three-quarters of yeast
L10 is sandwiched between helices 89 and 38, and appears
to be largely structurally conserved with its bacterial and
archael homologs (13–16). Inspection of these structures
reveals that these proteins represent an extension of H39
of the large subunit rRNA. In cryo-EM reconstitutions,
the eukaryote speciﬁc C-terminal region of L10 appears to
form a large unresolved mass adjacent to the L7/L12 stalk
in association with Helix 38 (17). In Saccharomyces cere-
visiae, L10 is encoded by the essential single copy RPL10
gene (18). L10 plays a critical role in 60S subunit biogen-
esis: incorporation of L10 into the large subunit constitu-
tes the last step of 60S subunit biogenesis (19). Speciﬁcally,
immature large subunits lacking L10 are exported from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the Crm1p pathway in
complex with the export adapter protein Nmd3p, after
which L10 is brought to the ribosome in the complex
with Sqt1p, promoting release of Nmd3p followed by
incorporation of L10. Depletion studies demonstrate
that large subunits lacking L10 are unable to form 80S
ribosomes and are translationally inactive (20,21). Thus,
L10 is the key component required for the ﬁnal activation
step of ribosomes in the cytoplasm. In addition, at least
one rpl10 allele has been shown to inhibit degradation of
nonsense-containing mRNAs, suggesting that L10 may
play a role in translational ﬁdelity (22). Thus, L10 is
important both for ribosome assembly and post-transcrip-
tional regulatory processes.
Toward the goal of furthering our understanding of
L10, a primary library of randomly mutagenized rpl10
alleles was screened for the inability to maintain the
yeast ‘Killer’ phenotype, which is caused by an endogen-
ous dsRNA virus that is highly sensitive to a broad array
of changes in the translational apparatus (23). This for-
ward genetic screen identiﬁed 56 new rpl10 alleles.
The mutants generally clustered into four regions of the
L10 structure: (i) in a ‘hook’ of L10 that inserts into
the bulge at the base Helix 89; (ii) in a cluster that
appears to form a bridge between Helices 38 and 39; (iii)
a series of amino acids that appear to form a plane along
the face of L10 that interacts with the distal regions
of Helices 89 and 38; and (iv) amino acids present in the
unresolved region of the protein that may directly
interact with the GTPase-associated center. The current
study focuses on the N-terminal ‘hook’ region of L10.
A series of genetic and biochemical studies led to a
detailed analysis of the eﬀects of two mutants in this
region on 25S rRNA structure. These were found to pro-
mote structural changes that map along the path taken by
tRNAs through the elongation cycle. When considered
along with the physical location of L10 within the large
subunit and its role in ribosome biogenesis, the ﬁnding
presented here are used to build a model for how L10
plays an important role for coordinating tRNA passage
through the ribosome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains, media and genetic methods
Escherichia coli strain DH5a was used to amplify plas-
mids, and E. coli transformations were performed using
the high-eﬃciency transformation method (24). The hap-
loid S. cerevisiae rpl10 gene deletion strain AJY1437
(MATa met15D0 leu2D0 ura3D0 his3D0 RPL10::kanR
pAJ392) was a kind gift from Dr. A.W. Johnson. The
L-A and M1 dsRNA viruses were introduced into this
strain by cytoplasmic mixing (cytoduction) (25) using
strain JD759 [MAT kar1-1 arg1 thr(i,x) (L-A HN M1)]
as the cytoplasm donor. The resulting strain was desig-
nated JD1293 [MATa rpl10::Kan met15D0 leu2D0
ura3D0 his3D0 pRPL10-URA3-2 (L-A HN M1)]. Yeast
cells were transformed using the alkali cation method (26).
YPAD and synthetic complete medium (H-), as well as
YPG, SD and 4.7 MB plates used for testing the killer
phenotype were prepared and used as described previously
(27). Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from IDT
(Coralville, IA). Dual luciferase assays to quantitatively
monitor translational recoding in yeast were performed
as previously described (28). The latter involved use of a
0-frame control reporter in combination with 1 riboso-
mal frameshift, or nonsense suppression test reporter con-
structs. Recoding eﬃciencies and statistical analyses were
performed as previously described (28,29). Ten-fold dilu-
tion spot assays to monitor sensitivity to anisomycin (20
g/ml) or paromomycin (3mg/ml) were performed as pre-
viously described (30).
Generation of rpl10 alleles
A library of plasmid-borne rpl10 mutants was constructed
using the error-prone PCR and gap repair method (31)
based on pJD589. To create pJD589, a 1-kb fragment
containing the 50 promoter, open reading frame and 30
untranslated region (UTR) sequences of RPL10 was sub-
cloned from the URA3-2 vector pAJ392 into the BamHI
sites of pRS313 (32). Silent mutations were added into
codons 4, 5, 220 and 221 of the RPL10 ORF to create
two StuI restriction sites. Mutagenesis primers (70 nt) for
PCR were designed to be complementary to the 50 and 30
UTRs of RPL10 and include the RPL10 translational
start and stop codons: (forward 50TTCCGCAAGTGC

genesis was performed with the GeneMorph II PCR
random mutagenesis kit with template concentrations
optimized to generate between one and four mutations
per RPL10 coding sequence. pJD589 was digested with
StuI, and the linearized plasmid lacking the RPL10
coding sequence was puriﬁed by Tris–acetate–EDTA–
agarose gel electrophoresis. This was cotransformed with
the randomly PCR-mutagenized RPL10 coding sequences
into JD1293 cells. Recombinants were selected for growth
on medium lacking histidine (-his), and cells having lost
the wild-type RPL10-containing plasmids were selected

for by replica plating onto 5-ﬂuoroorotic acid (5-FOA)-
containing medium (33). Note that recombination
between the PCR product and linearized vector was
designed so that the silent mutations would revert to
wild-type sequence in the recombinant clones.
Identification of rpl10 alleles unable to support the yeast
killer virus
Approximately 3000 His+ colonies were arrayed onto -his
plates, replica plated onto 4.7 MB plates seeded with
5 47 killer indicator cells, and incubated at 208C to iden-
tify Killer (K–) colonies as previously described (34).
Plasmids harboring rpl10 alleles were rescued into E. coli
from yeast strains that had lost the killer phenotype, rein-
troduced into JD1238 cells and rescored for the inability
to maintain the killer phenotype. The procedure was per-
formed three times in order to prevent identiﬁcation of
false positive strains due to spontaneous Killer virus loss.
RNA blot analyses
RNA (northern) blotting was performed as previously
described (35). Total RNA was extracted with acid
phenol/chlorophorm (pH=4.5) from mid-logarithmic
cell cultures as previously described (36). Equal amounts
of RNA (2.5g) were separated through a 1% agarose-
formaldehyde gel, RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N
membrane (Amersham) and UV cross linked to the mem-
brane. Nonspeciﬁc binding sites on the membrane were
blocked using ULTRAhyb-Oligo buﬀer (Ambion), incu-
bated with a [32P] 50-end-labeled oligonucleotide (50C
CGGGGTGCTTTCTGTGCTTACCGATACGACCTT
TACCGGCTG30) complementary to the 50 end of the
CYH2 CDS, and subsequently washed according to man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Hybridizing species were identi-
ﬁed using a GeneStorm phosphoimager (Bio-Rad), and
quantiﬁed using QuantifyOne software from Bio-Rad.
Ribosome biochemistry and visualization
Lysates of cycloheximide arrested yeast cells were sedi-
mented through 7–47% sucrose gradients and polysome
proﬁles were determined by monitoring A254 nm as pre-
viously described (37). S. cerevisiae ribosomes were iso-
lated, yeast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were puriﬁed
and yeast phenylalanyl-tRNAs were aminoacylated with
[14C]Phe and puriﬁed by HPLC as previously described
(6). Single-round peptidyltransfer assays using Ac-
[14C]Phe-tRNA and puromycin, and equilibrium binding
studies of [14C]Phe-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A-site
were carried out using poly(U) primed ribosomes as pre-
viously described (6). Equilibrium binding studies of eEF-
2 were performed as previously described (9). The data
were ﬁtted to a one-site-binding model with ligand deple-
tion using Prism Graph Pad software. rRNA structure
analysis using DMS, kethoxal and CMCT were performed
as previously described (9). The X-ray crystal structure of

were visualized using PyMOL (DeLano Scientiﬁc LLC).
RESULTS
Identification of translationally defective rpl10 alleles
Prior studies have implicated L10 with a broad range of
ribosome-associated functions, including large subunit
maturation, subunit association and NMD. These facts,
in combination with the centralized location of L10 within
the 3-D structure of the large subunit, provided us with
the motive to pursue an in-depth molecular genetic and
biochemical analysis of L10 function. Toward to this end,
a library of randomly mutagenized rpl10 alleles was
screened for the inability to maintain the yeast killer phe-
notype. The killer system of yeast is composed of L-A
helper, and M1 satellite dsRNA viruses (41). The
genome of the L-A virus encodes two open reading
frames where the ﬁrst encodes the Gag (capsid) protein,
and the second encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RDRP), the production of which is depen-
dent on a programmed –1 ribosomal frameshift (–1
PRF) (42,43). The single open reading frame of the M1
satellite virus encodes a protein toxin that is exported into
the surrounding media and kills uninfected cells, thus pro-
ducing the easily detectable Killer+ (K+) phenotype, and
its maintenance requires L-A to supply capsid proteins
and RDRP. M1 is highly sensitive to small perturbations
in the translational apparatus, including changes in –1
PRF eﬃciency (34), ribosome biogenesis defects (44) and
decreased overall protein synthesis (45). Thus, the killer
assay provides a simple and rapid method to screen for
translational defects.
The coding region of RPL10 was subjected to random
PCR mutagenesis and screened for loss of the killer phe-
notype as described in the Materials and methods section.
Mutant rpl10-HIS3 plasmids were rescued from Killer
minus (K–) strains, passaged through E. coli, reintroduced
into rpl10D cells and rescored for their abilities to promote
M1 virus loss. Due to a signiﬁcantly high intrinsic rate of
killer loss in the JD1293 strain background (10%), the
plasmid rescue and reintroduction procedure was repeated
three times to eliminate false-positive results. The rpl10
mutations responsible for conferring the K phenotype
were identiﬁed by DNA sequence analysis. From >3000
colonies tested, a total of 56 unique mutants were identi-
ﬁed. In addition, 15% of the mutants were lethal as
determined by their inability to grow as the sole allele of
rpl10 (data not shown). The collection of K– mutants con-
tained alleles harboring 35 single mutations, 20 double
mutations and one triple mutant. These are summarized
in Supplementary Table 1. A very large amount of overlap

was observed between the single and double mutants. The
high degree of overlap between the single and double
mutants led us to conclude that the mutagenesis was per-
formed to near saturation, and the large number of alleles
with single amino acid substitutions allowed exclusion of
alleles with multiple mutations from subsequent analysis.
Among the single mutants, multiple substitutions were
found at amino acid residues 7, 9, 40, 93, 94 and 145.
Areas of L10 with high frequencies of mutations were
clustered in three regions of the protein. These regions
spanned amino acids 7–17, 59–94 and 144–152.
Consistent with ﬁndings from the Johnson lab, no viable
mutants mapping to the unstructured central loop (amino
acids 102–112) were identiﬁed in the current study, con-
sistent with the suggestion that his loop may play a critical
function in peptidyltransfer (46). As diagramed in
Figure 1, the mutants appear to cluster into four distinct
groups, speciﬁcally: (i) in a hook-like structure located at
the N-terminal region of L10 that inserts into the major
groove of helix 89; (ii) in a space that appears to link
helices 38 and 39; (iii) along a plane of the protein lying
‘atop’ of helix 89; and (iv) in the unresolved C-terminal
domain of L10 that appears to extend outward toward the
GTPase-associated center. Given this apparent structural
complexity of L10, we chose to focus on characterizing the
N-terminal ‘hook domain’ mutants for this study.
The N-terminal ‘hook’ mutants affect cell growth
Ribosome-associated defects commonly promote deﬁcien-
cies in cellular growth at ambient temperature. As a semi-
quantitative monitor of this, 10-fold dilution spot assays
were performed on rich medium at 308C, revealing allele-
speciﬁc growth defects by the R7Q and Y11C mutants
(Figure 2A). Note that the large colonies in the Y11C
sample appear to be escape mutants. Changes in ribosome
structure and function also alter the growth characteristics
of cells at decreased and/or elevated temperatures. Thus,
these mutants were assayed with regard to their resistance
or sensitivity to low (158C) and high (378C) temperatures.
As shown in Figure 2B, mutations of the tyrosines in the
N-terminal region of the protein bridging helices 89 and
39, i.e. Y9H, Y9N and Y11C promoted enhanced growth
at low temperature. In contrast, none of these mutants
aﬀected growth at 378C (Figure 2C). Ten-fold serial dilu-
tion assays were also used to probe the eﬀects of small
molecule protein synthesis inhibitors on the translational
apparatus. Anisomycin is a competitive inhibitor of A-site
binding and sterically hinders positioning of the acceptor
end of the A-site tRNA in the PTC (47). All of the other
mutants were either hypersensitive as determined by
reduced growth at 15g/ml anisomycin (R7Q, Y9H,
Y9N and Y11C), or resistant as evidenced by the ability
to grow on medium containing 20g/ml anisomycin
(R7L, R7P and Y9C) (Figure 2D and E, and summarized
in Table 1). These data indicate a high degree of allele-
speciﬁcity with regard to this drug. Another small mole-
cule drug, paromomycin, binds at the decoding center on
the small subunit and promotes conformational changes
associated with formation of the codon–anticodon helix
between mRNA and incoming A-site tRNA (48). Thus,
paromomycin was used as a probe for defects associated
with interactions between the small and large subunits.

None of the mutants promoted paromomycin-speciﬁc
changes in growth (data not shown), thus indicating that
the observed eﬀects on cell growth were conferred by
changes in the large subunit.
Effects on translational fidelity
Alterations in ribosome structure can aﬀect the ﬁdelity of
protein translation. Changes in –1 PRF have been shown
to interfere with virus propagation by altering the ratio
viral Gag to Gag-pol proteins (34), and thus altered –1
PRF frequencies could be one possible reason underlying
the K phenotypes of the rpl10 mutants. An in vivo dual-
luciferase reporter assay and statistical analysis package
(28,29) was used to quantitatively assess –1 PRF in the
wild-type RPL10, and isogenic rpl10 strains. In wild-type
cells, –1PRF was 8.3  0.16%. Surprisingly, –1PRF eﬃ-
ciency was not strongly aﬀected in any of the rpl10 mutant
strains (Figure 3A, white bars) suggesting that –1 PRF
defects were not the major cause of the K phenotypes.
The dual luciferase assay was also used to quantitatively
access the eﬀects of the rpl10 alleles on the ability of ribo-
somes to recognize termination codons (nonsense suppres-
sion). This analysis revealed strong allele-speciﬁc eﬀects
(Figure 3A, gray bars). While nonsense suppression was
0.27%  0.01% in wild-type cells, it was stimulated by
1.5-fold by the R7L mutant but not by the other two
mutants as this position. In contrast all of the Y9 mutants
appeared to promote hyperaccurate termination codon
recognition, decreasing rates of nonsense-suppression by
1.8-fold (Y9C) and 2.5-fold (Y9N). The translational ﬁdel-
ity data are summarized in Table 1.
It had been previously shown that the grc5-1 allele of
RPL10 promoted defective turnover of nonsense-contain-
ing mRNAs (22). Although the bicistronic reporters
internally control for apparent changes in translational
ﬁdelity due to eﬀects on mRNA stability (28,49), to
further exclude this possibility and to determine whether
any of the new rpl10 alleles aﬀected nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay, levels of the ineﬃciently spliced CYH2
precursor-mRNA were assayed by northern blot analy-
sis using total RNA extracted from cells expressing
the three rpl10 alleles that most aﬀected nonsense-
suppression, and from control isogenic wild-type and
upf1D cells. While the CYH2 pre-mRNA was stabilized
in the upf1D strain, none of the mutants appeared to sta-
bilize this species relative to isogenic wild-type controls
(Figure 3B), conﬁrming their eﬀects on nonsense-
suppression.
All of the L10N-terminal hook mutants affect 60S
subunit biogenesis
L10 is the last protein incorporated into the large subunit
and is required for formation of active ribosomes (50).
During translation initiation, the 43S complex recruits
the mRNA to form the 48S complex, after which the
60S subunit is recruited. Insuﬃcient levels of 60S subunits,
or 60S subunits deﬁcient in their ability to form 80S ribo-
somes, tend to promote accumulation of 48S–mRNA
complexes, and this additional mass results in intermedi-
ate sedimentation coeﬃcients as monitored by the appear-
ance of ‘halfmers shoulders’ on the denser sides of
polysome tracings. L10 mutants aﬀecting inclusion of
the protein into large subunits have been shown to pro-
mote the appearance of these halfmer shoulders in poly-
some proﬁles (21), and 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis
defects have been linked with defects in killer virus main-
tenance (44). Sucrose gradient analyses revealed that all
but the Y9H and Y11C mutants promoted formation of
halfmers (Figure 3C), many with greater amplitude than
previously observed in the temperature sensitive mutants
(21). Additionally, observation of decreased amplitude of
the 60S relative to 40S peaks, of 80S relative to 40S and
60S peaks, or an increase in the amount of material near
the top of the gradient are also associated with 60S sub-
unit biogenesis defects. These eﬀects were observed in the
R7L, R7Q, Y9C, Y9H, Y9N and Y11C mutants (sum-
marized in Table 1). These results point to 60S subunit
ribosome biogenesis defects as the most likely cause
of the inability of the rpl10 mutants to maintain the
killer virus.

Ribosome biochemistry
Previous studies from our laboratory using mutants of
ribosomal protein L3 demonstrated an inverse relation-
ship between the aﬃnity of ribosomes for aa-tRNA and
eEF2 (9). Equilibrium dissociation constants were deter-
mined for aa-tRNA using of [14C]Phe-tRNA and non-salt-
washed ribosomes, and for eEF2 by monitoring the ability
of diphtheria toxin to label ribosome bound eEF2 with
[14C]NAD+. The inverse relationship between aa-tRNA
and eEF2 aﬃnities was also observed with the L10 mutants
(Figure 4, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). In all
cases, increased aﬃnity for aa-tRNA was matched by
decreased aﬃnity for eEF2 and vice versa. In particular,
the Y9C and Y11Cmutants showed dramatically opposing
eﬀects on these two parameters. The Y9C mutant pro-
moted an 8-fold increase in Kd for aa-tRNA, and an
50% decrease in Kd for eEF2. Conversely, the Kds of
Y11C ribosomes for aa-tRNA were 0.86- and 1.54-fold of
wild-type. No signiﬁcant changes in peptidyltransferase
activities were observed between wild-type and mutant
ribosomes (data not shown).
Chemical protection studies: the Y9C and Y11C forms of
L10 produce profound local and long-distance changes in
25S rRNA structure
In light of their strong and opposing eﬀects on aa-tRNA
and eEF2 binding, the eﬀects of the Y9C and Y11C
mutants on 25S rRNA structure were probed using three

Figure 3. The L10N-terminal hook mutants promote allele-speciﬁc eﬀects on nonsense codon recognition and ribosome biogenesis/subunit joining.
(A) Allele-speciﬁc eﬀects on nonsense codon recognition but not programmed –1 ribosomal frameshifting (–1 PRF). Isogenic yeast cells expressing
either wild-type or mutant forms of L10 were transformed with dual luciferase reporter and control plasmids (28) and rates of translational recoding
were determined. –1 PRF indicates programmed –1 ribosomal frameshifting promoted by the yeast L-A virus frameshift signal. Nons-supp. denotes
the ability of ribosomes able to suppress an in-frame UAA termination codon located between the Renilla and ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter genes.
Relative diﬀerences in recoding eﬃciencies of the mutants is depicted as fold of wild-type. Error bars denote standard error as previously described
(29). (B) The mutants do not aﬀect nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. A northern blot of total RNA extracted from isogenic wild-type and indicated
L10 mutants was probed with a [32P]-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the yeast CYH2 coding sequence as previously described
(62). Locations of the unspliced CYH2 pre-mRNA and of the mature CYH2 mRNA are indicated. (C) Most of the L10 mutants promote strong 60S
biogenesis and subunit joining defects. Cytoplasmic extracts from isogenic strains were loaded onto 7–47% sucrose gradients, centrifuged in an SW41
rotor at 40 000 r.p.m. for 180min at 48C, fractionated and analyzed by continuous monitoring of A254 (63). The locations of 40S, 60S, 80S, polysome
fractions and halfmers are labeled. The presence of halfmers is typically due to subunit joining defects or to lower abundance of 60S subunits as a
consequence of 60S biogenesis defects.

base-speciﬁc solvent-accessible reagents: dimethylsulfate
(DMS), kethoxal and carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfo-
nate (CMCT). rRNAs were extracted, and modiﬁed bases
were identiﬁed by primer extension using reverse tran-
scriptase to detect methylation at the N3 position of uri-
dines and the N1 position of guanosines (CMCT), at the
N1 and N2 positions of guanosines (kethoxal), and at the
N1 position of adenosines and N3 position of cytidines
(DMS) (51). The primers used were designed to probe
functional regions of domain V (including the A-site and
P-site loops, the PTC, and the helices adjacent to these
structures, i.e. Helices 73, 74, 88–93), Helices 94–96 and
Helix 38 (9,11).
Autoradiograms generated from these experiments are
shown in Figure 5A. Figure 5B and C show 2-dimensional
maps of the relevant regions of yeast 25S rRNA onto
which nucleotides having altered chemical protection pat-
terns in the Y11C and Y9C mutants have been mapped.
This information was in turn used to map the modiﬁed
bases onto the structure of the yeast ribosome (2) in
Figure 5D and E. The chemical protection patterns are
also mapped onto ﬁve additional high-resolution ribo-
some structures (Supplementary Figure 2). Although no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in the locations of
bases with chemical modiﬁcation changes, as discussed
below, this analysis did reveal diﬀerences in the locations
of the N-terminal hook domain. Examination of the data
reveals that both of the mutants confer signiﬁcant changes
in 25S rRNA structure. The Y11C mutant is marked by
signiﬁcant changes radiating outward and parallel to L10
from the site of the mutation along Helices 89 and 38 (and
expansion segment 12, which is not present in the atomic
resolution structure) (Figure 5A, B and D). The aﬀected
bases in these structures are mostly deprotected, suggest-
ing that the Y11C mutant destabilizes interactions
between L10 and these rRNA helical structures.
Interestingly, the changes in H38 and H89 are similar to
those promoted by rRNA mutants located in Helix 38 (7).
An additional series of long-distance changes are observed
extending along a line from the base of the peptidyltrans-
ferase center (G2813–G2815) along Helix 74 and out to
Helix 88: as discussed below, this follows the path taken
by the 30 end of the deacylated tRNA as it moves from the
P-site to the E-site and exits the ribosome. The aﬀected
bases in this cluster tend to be hyperprotected as com-
pared to wild-type ribosomes, suggesting that the Y11C
promoted disruption of the local interactions between L10
and Helices 38 and 89 has caused them to collapse into
more distantly located structures. This pattern is also simi-
lar to one observed by another rRNA mutant, 2922C,
located at the base of Helix 92 in the A-loop (11).
Additionally, one base at the tip of Helix 91 (A2901,
E. coli U2583), which abuts the SRL, became hyperpro-
tected by this mutant. Attention is directed to four speciﬁc
bases. First, U2860 (E. coli U2483) helps to form one
side of the ﬁrst ‘gate’ through which aa-tRNA passes
during the process of accommodation (12). Second,
A2818 (E. coliA2450) is located in the core of the peptidyl-
transferase center. Third, G2815 (E. coliG2447) was hyper-
protected by this mutant and is discussed in the context of
anisomycin hypersensitivity. Fourth, G2777 (E. coli
A2406) which is normally base-paired with C311 (E. coli
U416) in helix 22 became deprotected, and C2775
(E. coliU2404) displayed an enhanced in-line cleavage pat-
tern, suggesting an opening of a proposed E-site gate
responsible for movement of tRNA from the P-site to the
E-site and release of deacylated tRNA from the ribosome.
Examination of the eﬀects of the Y9C mutant on 25S
rRNA chemical protection patterns reveals a distinctly
diﬀerent picture marked by more local changes along
the aa-tRNA accommodation corridor (Figure. 5A,
C and E). Proximal to the mutant amino acid, U2828
(E. coli U2460) was hyperprotected, suggesting that an
interaction between it and L10 were signiﬁcantly altered.
Deprotection of bases in Helix 38 (A1947, A1048) and
Helix 89 (A2844, A2850) that appear to interact with
other parts of L10 suggests that the local change may
have radiated outward from the mutated residue disrupt-
ing the interaction of L10 with these helices.
Hyperprotection of bases along the aa-tRNA accommo-
dation corridor, in particular U2861 (E. coli U2492) and
U2923 (E. coli U2555), and extending outward to regions
of Helix 95, suggests collapse of this structure into the
corridor. Finally, the strong deprotection of A2818 and
A2819 (E. coli A2450 and A2451) indicates structural
changes in the peptidyltransferase center. The possible sig-
niﬁcance of the chemical protection patterns observed in
the Y9C and Y11C mutant ribosomes is discussed below.

were identiﬁed in the N-terminal ‘hook’ region composed
of residues R7, Y9 and Y11. All these residues either con-
tact the PTC-proximal bulge in the H89 or with nearby
residues. The second group, A64, K74, N144, K145 and
L152, appear to interact with H89. Group three appears to
directly contact or be in close proximity with the bulge in
H38 and includes eight mutants at six positions (K15,
Y17, V26, Q59, P93 and F94). In particular, K15 and
Y17 link Helices 38 and 39, each appearing to make con-
tact with both structures. The fourth group is located in
the C-terminal region of L10, the structure of which is
currently unresolved. Together with tip of the H38, this
region of the protein forms an extension that approaches
the L7/L12 stalk. We attribute K40 and G81positions to
this group because they topologically represent the base of
this extension. Consistent with a previous report (46), no
mutations were found in the unstructured loop of L10 that
is thought to most closely approach the PTC, thus indi-
rectly suggesting that this loop is either not important for
ribosome biogenesis, peptidyltransfer and/or translational
ﬁdelity (unlikely), or that it is so important that mutants in
this region are inviable (more likely). A full analysis of all
of the mutants identiﬁed in the current study is beyond the
scope of a single manuscript. Thus, we chose to focus
more deeply on those located in the N-terminal ‘hook’
region of L10 in the current study in order to establish a
connection with ribosomal protein L3 (see accompanying
manuscript by Meskauskas,A. and Dinman,J.D.) with an
emphasis on how ribosome structure informs function.
Ribosome structure and elongation factor interactions:
an allosteric model
The TC and eEF2 are structural mimics of one another
and bind to essentially the same site of the ribosome (1).
How then does the ribosome coordinate its interactions
with these two ligands at the correct phases of the elonga-
tion cycle? The Dontsova group used mutants of Helix 42
in E. coli to demonstrate that activation of EF-G may
involve allosteric signaling from the peptidyltransferase
center to the GAC, and that the diﬀerence between the
EF-G and TC-binding sites may be due to diﬀerences in
the positioning of the GAC relative to the SRL (52,53).
We subsequently proposed a complementary model sug-
gesting that ribosomal protein L3 functions as the ‘gate-
keeper to the A-site’ within this scheme (9). This model
has been expanded and reﬁned in the accompanying
manuscript. These studies propose that L3 plays a role
in coordinating the orderly binding of the elongation fac-
tors and peptidyltransferase activity by participating in a
series of local allosteric changes in rRNA structure.
Speciﬁcally we proposed that the ‘open’ aa-tRNA accom-
modation corridor conformation deﬁnes the TC-binding
site, while the ‘closed’ conformation favors eEF2 binding.
Examination of the atomic scale ribosome structures
reveals that L10 lies on the opposite side of the accommo-
dation corridor and PTC from L3 (e.g. see Figure 5D),
and data in the accompanying manuscript indicate that
bases in H89 that interact with the N-terminal hook of
L10 are involved in this process. The data from the current
study closely complement those from our studies of L3,
in particular with regard to coordination of elongation
factor interactions. Speciﬁcally, in the Y9C mutant, hyper-
protection of the Gate 1 bases (U2860 and U2923, E. coli
U2492 and U2555), accompanied by increased aﬃnity for
eEF2 and decreased aﬃnity for aa-tRNA is consistent
with a ‘closed’ accommodation corridor/eEF2-binding
site. Conversely in the Y11C mutant, deprotection of
U2861 (E. coli U2493) coupled with increased aﬃnity
for aa-tRNA and decreased aﬃnity for eEF2 is consistent
with the ‘open’ corridor/TC-binding conformation. In
addition, deprotection of G2777 (E. coli A2406) and
enhanced in-line cleavage of C2775 (E. coli U2404) sug-
gests that the ‘E-site gate’, through which deacylated
tRNA passes on its way from the P-site to the E-site
and out of the ribosome (39,54–57), is also open in this
mutant. The eﬀects of these mutants on ribosome struc-
ture along the entire path traversed by tRNAs during the
elongation cycle leads us to propose that L10 plays an
important role in coordinating tRNA movement through
the large subunit.
Anisomycin resistance/hypersensitivity and
ribosome structure
The L10 mutants examined in the current study displayed
a range of phenotypes related to anisomycin, ranging from
strong drug resistance (R7L, R7P and Y9C) to hypersen-
sitive (Y9H, Y9N and Y11C). Anisomycin resistance by
ribosomal protein L3 mutants was previously proposed to
be due to opening of the accommodation corridor,
increasing diﬀusion rates of the relatively large aa-tRNA
into the PTC relative to the much smaller drug (6,9). This
model cannot explain the observations made with the L10
mutants in the current study, where Y9C (corridor closed)
is drug resistant while Y11C (corridor open) is hypersen-
sitive. Two more-recent studies point to changes in the
drug-binding site being responsible for anisomycin resis-
tance (11,58). Mutation of E. coli C2452 to U (yeast
C2820U, H. marismortui 2487U) confers very strong ani-
somycin resistance. Chemical protection studies in the
yeast mutant showed that anisomycin was unable to pro-
tect this base from chemical attack, suggesting that aniso-
mycin cannot interact with a U at this position. The X-ray
crystal structure of the analogous H. marismortui mutant
conﬁrmed this model. In the current study, we did not
detect any changes in the sensitivity of this base to chemi-
cal modifying agents. However the increased sensitivity of
the two 50 adjacent bases (A2818 and A2819, E. coli A2450
and A2451) could account for the resistance of the Y9C
mutant to this drug. This does not address the question of
how Y11C, in which A2818 (E. coli A2450) is also depro-
tected, could be anisomycin hypersensitive. A potential
answer might be gleaned from the anisomycin-resistant
G2447C and G2447U H. marismortui mutants (58). This
base contacts anisomycin through a K+, and the two
mutants cause drug resistance by altering the position of
this ion. In yeast, the corresponding base is G2815; this
base and its two 50 neighbors are deprotected in the Y11C
mutant (Figure 5). We suggest that this mutant may result
in a change in this region of the anisomycin-binding
pocket that confers increased aﬃnity for anisomycin,

resulting in drug hypersensitivity. This idea is supported
by the increased aﬃnity of Y11C for aa-tRNA, the 30end
of which partially overlaps with the anisomycin-binding
pocket.
Ribosome structure, translational fidelity and virus
maintenance
Some of the L10 ‘hook’ mutants had strong eﬀects on ter-
mination codon recognition (Figure 3A).We speculate that
this may be explained by open/closed nature of accommo-
dation corridor. The closed conformation, e.g. Y9C, could
decrease aa-tRNA accommodation rates, providing more
time for ribosomes to reject suppressor tRNAs during the
proofreading phase of translation elongation (59).
Conversely, the ‘open’ mutants (Y11C, and perhaps R7L)
may inhibit proofreading by allowing faster accommoda-
tion of incorrect tRNAs. Since –1 PRF was at best only
marginally aﬀected by themutants examined in the study, it
is more likely that the killer virus maintenance defects of
the L10N-terminal ‘hook’ mutants were due to their strong
eﬀects on 60S biogenesis as previously described (44,45).
L10 and information flow through the ribosome
Inspection of Figure 5D shows that L10 lies along a plane
formed by Helix 38, Helix 39/L10, Helix 89, Helix 91 and
Helix 95. This can be compared to ﬁve ﬁngers, with L10 as
a proteinaceous prosthesis of Helix 39. In addition, L10
interacts with the D-loop of 5S rRNA (data not shown).
Why would nature select for a removable protein to
occupy this space rather than simply extending Helix 39?
Examination of its placement reveals that L10 is at the
center of a topological nexus that interacts with: 5S
rRNA, thus connecting it to the B1b and B1c intersubunit
bridges at the crown of the large subunit; the GTPase-
associated center, connecting it to elongation factor acti-
vation; the A-site ﬁnger (Helix 38), connecting it with the
decoding center through the B1a bridge; and the peptidyl-
transferase center. We suggest that the information ﬂow
through this region of the large subunit is too complex to
be monitored by a simple rRNA helix, thus necessitating
the evolution of an informationally more complex mole-
cule such as a protein to occupy this site. Thus, we suggest
that L10 functions to collect, distribute and coordinate
information throughout the large subunit.
The observed eﬀects of the L10 mutants on ribosome
structure and function could be explained consequent to
60S mis-assembly defects. This notion is supported by
studies of the prokaryotic ortholog L16 showing that it
is only important for late assembly steps but that it is not
involved in other ribosomal functions (60). However, in
support of our model, we note that if mis-assembly were
the major issue, then the Y9C and Y11C mutants would
have displayed similar changes in chemical protection pat-
terns. This was not the case. Instead, the chemical protec-
tion patterns observed with the Y9C mutants more closely
resembled those observed for various mutants of riboso-
mal protein L3 [(9) and accompanying manuscript], while
those for the Y11C mutants more closely resembled those
observed for mutants of Helix 38 and of the A-loop (7,11),
suggesting that the Y9C and Y11C mutants independently
impact on two discrete physical pathways for information
ﬂow through the ribosome.
Lastly, is L10 involved in the process of ribosome ratch-
eting between the pre- and post-translocational states
(61)? Comparison of the L10 (bacterial L16, archae
L10e) N-terminal regions between seven diﬀerent high-
resolution ribosome structures suggest that it can assume
two diﬀerent conformations: interacting with Helix 89 or
with Helix 38 (see Supplementary Figure 2). One possible
interpretation of these comparisons is that the hook inter-
acts with Helix 89 when the A-site is unoccupied (the post-
translocation state), while it interacts with Helix 38 when
the A-site is occupied (pre-translocation state). It is possi-
ble that the N-terminal ‘hook’ of L10 may participate in
this process through its interactions with the PTC prox-
imal loop of Helix 89 (post-state) and Helix 38 (pre-state).
By this model, interaction of the L10 hook with bases in
the PTC-proximal bulge in Helix 89 may help to open the
aa-tRNA accommodation corridor. Upon A-site tRNA
occupancy, the L10 hook could ﬂip up to interact with
H38, releasing the H89 gate base to interact with its part-
ner at the base of Helix 92, which is controlled through
the L3 ‘rocker switch’ (see accompanying manuscript by
Meskauskas,A. and Dinman,J.D.). By this model then,
the Y9C mutant would thermodynamically favor the
closed conformation while Y11C would drive it toward
the open state. Alternatively, it is possible that no such
switch exists, and that the diﬀerences in the atomic resolu-
tion structures could be due to phylogenetic diﬀerences
(eukaryotes and archae versus bacteria), or due to diﬀer-
ent crystallization conditions. The answers to these ques-
tions await the availability of high-resolution structures of
eukaryotic ribosomes and of bacterial ribosomes com-
plexed with EF-G.
