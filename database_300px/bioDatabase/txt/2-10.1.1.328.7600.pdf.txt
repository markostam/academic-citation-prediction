Abstract
Recent findings in tumor biopsies from lung adenocarcinoma
patients suggest that somatic mutations in the genes encoding
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten ras
(KRAS) confer sensitivity and resistance, respectively, to EGFR
inhibition. Here, we provide evidence that these genetic
mutations are not sufficient to modulate the biological
response of lung adenocarcinoma cells to EGFR inhibition.
We found high expression of ErbB family members, ErbB
ligands, or both in three models that were sensitive to EGFR
inhibition, including alveolar epithelial neoplastic lesions in
mice that develop lung adenocarcinoma by oncogenic KRAS ,
human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and tumor biopsies
from lung adenocarcinoma patients. Thus, lung adenocarci-
noma cells that depend on EGFR for survival constitutively
activate the receptor through a combination of genetic
mutations and overexpression of EGFR dimeric partners and
their ligands. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(24): 11478-85)
Introduction
Somatic mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
the gene encoding the EGFR, have been found in the tumors of 10%
to 40% of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; refs.
1–4). These mutations activate the EGFR tyrosine kinase and are
associated with adenocarcinoma histology, female gender, and a
nonsmoking history. Lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations
frequently experience rapid and sustained shrinkage of primary
and metastatic disease after treatment with the EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib or erlotinib (1–4). In a phase III
trial, treatment with erlotinib conferred a survival benefit (5), but
the proportion of patients who experienced this benefit exceeded
the expected frequency of EGFR mutations. In addition, a small
proportion of patients whose tumors shrank in response to EGFR
TKIs had no evidence of EGFR mutations (1–5). Together, these
findings suggest that factors other than EGFR mutations confer
sensitivity to EGFR inhibition.
EGFR forms homodimers and heterodimers with the other ErbB
family members ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (6). These dimeric
complexes have distinct ligand binding and signaling activities (7).
For example, ErbB3 is unique in that it lacks a functional kinase
domain. Despite this deficiency, ErbB3 undergoes transphosphor-
ylation in complex with other ErbBs and activates downstream
kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in response
to ligand binding. Recent studies have implicated ErbB3 in the
sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines to EGFR inhibition (8, 9). Together,
these findings suggest that aberrant expression of ErbB family
members contributes to the responsiveness of NSCLC cells to
EGFR inhibition.
A recent report (10) linked de novo resistance to treatment with
EGFR TKIs in lung adenocarcinoma patients with somatic
mutations in Kirsten ras (KRAS). A growing body of evidence
indicates that KRAS mutations are important in the development
of lung adenocarcinoma. They occur in 30% to 50% of lung
adenocarcinomas (11, 12) and are mutually exclusive from
mutations in EGFR (13). Mice that express mutant KRAS develop
lung adenocarcinoma rapidly and with high penetrance (14–17). In
this study, we investigated the role of KRAS mutations in the
resistance of lung adenocarcinoma to EGFR TKIs. We examined
KrasLA1 mice, which develop lung adenocarcinoma through
somatic activation of a KRAS allele carrying an activating mutation
in codon 12 (G12D; ref. 17). Alveolar epithelial cells in this mouse
model recapitulate the series of morphologic stages through which
human atypical alveolar hyperplasia (AAH) evolves into adenocar-
cinoma. Our findings suggest that the presence of KRAS mutations
is not sufficient to confer resistance to EGFR inhibition and reveal
a novel mechanism of response to EGFR inhibition that is
potentially relevant to lung cancer patients.
Materials and Methods
Animal experiments. Animal experiments were compliant with the
guidelines of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The
KrasLA1 mice were provided by Dr. Tyler Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cambridge, MA), and gefitinib was provided by AstraZeneca
(Wilmington, DE). Four-month-old KrasLA1 mice were randomly allocated
to treatment with vehicle (PBS with 0.05% Tween 80 in PBS by oral
gavage daily), low-dose gefitinib (100 mg/kg/d), or high-dose gefitinib
(250 mg/kg/d). Treatment was given for 28 days with a 4-day intermission at
14 days to minimize dermatologic toxicity. Mice treated with high-dose

gefitinib or vehicle were imaged by micro–computed tomography (micro-
CT) at the beginning and completion of treatment to examine changes in
lesion size as described previously (18). Mice were killed at the completion
of therapy. At that time, an investigator who was blinded to the identity of
the treatment groups counted lesions visible on lung pleural surfaces. One
lung from each mouse was then frozen for protein extraction, and the other
was formalin fixed for immunohistochemical analysis.
Cell lines. The LKR-13 and LKR-10 cell lines (provided by Dr. Tyler Jacks)
were derived by serial passage of minced lung adenocarcinoma tissues from
two tumors isolated from separate lobes of the same KrasLA1 mouse. These
cells and the human NSCLC cell lines (H1299, HCC827, H3255, H1819,
H4006, and HCC2279) were passaged in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum on standard Falcon (Bedford, MA) plasticware.
Immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and KRAS/HBECs
were cultured with keratinocyte serum-free medium containing bovine
pituitary extract and recombinant EGF (Gibco). KRAS/HBECs were derived
by stably infecting parental HBECs with the retroviral vector pBabe-
hyg-KRAS2-V12. H1299 cells were transfected with a vector (pcDNA3.1)
expressing wild-type or mutant (D746-750) EGFR , and single-cell subclones
were selected in G418. Expression of the exogenous (wild-type or mutant)
EGFR mRNA was confirmed in single-cell subclones by real-time PCR (RT-
PCR) analysis of total cellular RNA (1 Ag) using primers spanning exons 18
and 19 and by direct sequencing of the PCR products. PCR products of the
D746-750 EGFR transfectants lacked 15 bp corresponding to the deletion
mutation. EGFR-transfected H1299 cells were subsequently transfected with
a vector expressing ErbB3, and single-cell subclones of the double
transfectants (EGFR and ErbB3) were selected in G418 and hygromycin.
All cells were maintained at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2.
Antibodies. For Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis,
we used antibodies specific for EGFR (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), ErbB2 and
ErbB3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), h-actin (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), and Tyr1289-phosphorylated ErbB3 (pErbB3), Ser473-phosphorylated
AKT (pAKT), actin, and AKT (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA).
RNA analysis. Total RNA was prepared from whole mouse lung tissues
and cell lines using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) was done using
1 Ag of each RNA sample, which was reverse transcribed and used in a
PCR reaction to measure the transcript levels of each gene. Levels were
normalized relative to those of h-glucuronidase or glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in each sample. Gene expression was
assayed using Assays-On-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a Stratagene (La Jolla, CA)
Mx3000P RT-PCR machine.
Cell proliferation. Cell proliferation was measured using the 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) color-
imetric dye reduction method. Cells were seeded at a density of 1  103 to
5  103 per well (10 replicate wells per assay condition) in 0.1 mL medium,
treated for 5 days with different dosages of gefitinib, and subjected to MTT
assays.
Immunoblot analysis. Whole lung tissues were homogenized using a
Tearor homogenizer in Reingeauld lysis buffer [200 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
137 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100
Amol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nmol/L okadaic acid, 1 mmol/
L sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor cocktail]. Cell lines were
washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L phenylmethyl-
sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L NaF, and
protease inhibitor cocktail]. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and
protein concentrations were measured with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were
then immunoblotted overnight at 4jC with primary antibodies in TBS
containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Antibody binding was detected with an
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) according
to the manufacturer’s directions.
Mutational analysis of tumor samples and cell lines. Approximately
103 tumor cells were microdissected from sequential 8 Am-thick tissue
sections that were stained with H&E, fixed in formalin, and embedded in
paraffin. DNA was extracted from tumor samples and cell lines using 25 AL
Pico Pure DNA extraction solution (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA)
containing proteinase K and incubated at 65 jC for 24 hours. Exons 18
to 21 of EGFR and codon 12 of KRAS were amplified by PCR using intron-
based primers as described previously (13). All PCR products were directly
sequenced using the Applied Biosystems PRISM dye terminator cycle
sequencing method (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, CA). All sequence variants
were confirmed by independent PCR amplifications from at least two
independent microdissections and were sequenced in both directions.
Tissue microarrays. Tissue microarrays were constructed with cores
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks, and triplicate core samples
were included for each tumor. To examine changes in the expression of
ErbB3 and pAKT with malignant progression, an array was constructed with
specimens of mouse normal lung tissue (n = 30), AAH (n = 40), adenoma
(n = 206), and adenocarcinoma (n = 11) according to the histologic criteria
established (17). To examine changes in the expression of ErbB3 and pAKT
resulting from gefitinib treatment, an array was constructed from all lesions
identified by histologic analysis from the mice treated with gefitinib or
vehicle. Each lesion was sampled with a single core 1 mm in diameter, as
the lesions were too small to permit multiple cores to be obtained.
For human studies, we constructed an array using tumor samples from
patients before oral administration of gefitinib (250 mg/d) at The University
of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Only patients for whom pertinent
clinical data were available were included. Response to treatment was
measured with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and
patients with more than one lesion were categorized according to the lesion
that achieved the best response. Stabilization of disease was defined as an
absence of change in lesion size for at least 6 months following treatment
initiation.
Immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemical analyses, 4-Am
sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed with PBS as described
previously (18). Antigens were retrieved with 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6;
DakoCytomation) for 30 minutes in a steamer. Samples were blocked for
endogenous activity with 3% hydrogen peroxide/PBS, avidin/biotin solution
(Zymed, Carlsbad, CA), and Dako serum-free protein block (DakoCytoma-
tion, Carpinteria, CA) before incubation with the primary antibodies
overnight at 4jC. Standard avidin/biotin immunoperoxidase methods, with
diaminobenzidine as the chromogen, were used for detection. As negative
controls for the specificity of the immunostaining results, we pretreated
the samples with blocking peptides. ErbB3-blocking peptides were the
17 COOH-terminal amino acids.
Staining was quantified by two investigators (M.W. and I.I.W.) who were
blinded to the identity of the treatment groups. Staining in each sample was
quantified from a single tissue section using a combined score based on
staining intensity  extension. Staining intensity was graded as undetect-
able (0), weak (1), medium (2), or strong (3). Staining extension was graded
as the percentage of positive cells per square at 20 magnification. The
tumor score was defined as the highest of the three core samples, and
results were presented as mean (SE).
Statistical analysis. The immunostaining scores, patient age, tumor
numbers, and tumor volumes were considered continuous variables and
were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney
nonparametric test with Bonferroni correction. P = 0.05 was considered
significant for two pair-wise comparisons, 0.017 for three pair-wise
comparisons, and 0.012 for four pair-wise comparisons. Fisher’s exact test
was used to compare categorical variables, and P = 0.05 was considered
significant. Data were processed with StatView and Survival Tools software
version 5.0 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA).

gavage for 28 days with low-dose gefitinib (100 mg/kg; 23 mice),
high-dose gefitinib (250 mg/kg; 21 mice), or vehicle only (47 mice)
beginning at 4 months of age. After treatment, we counted the
lesions on lung pleural surfaces at the time of autopsy. In addition,
mice treated with high-dose gefitinib or vehicle were imaged by
micro-CT at the beginning and completion of treatment to examine
changes in lesion size (examples are shown in Fig. 1A). Gefitinib
treatment was well tolerated; mice experienced facial dermatitis
but showed no evidence of weight loss or other overt toxicities. We
observed a reduction in the number of lung lesions in mice treated
with low-dose or high-dose gefitinib, and lesion size decreased in
the high-dose group (Fig. 1B).
Alveolar neoplastic lesions in KrasLA1 mice overexpress
ErbB3 and ErbB ligands. We hypothesized that the sensitivity of
alveolar neoplastic lesions in KrasLA1 mice to gefitinib is a
consequence of aberrant expression of ErbB family members, ErbB
ligands, or both. We examined the expression of ErbB family
members in lung tissues at 5 months, when early epithelial changes
(AAH and adenomas but no adenocarcinomas) were present.
Q-PCR analysis was done on RNA prepared from whole lung
tissues. Relative to their wild-type littermates, KrasLA1 mice
expressed higher levels of c-ErbB3 and lower levels of ErbB1
(EGFR) and ErbB2 (HER-2/neu ; Fig. 2A). Because the lung mRNA in
KrasLA1 mice represented that of both normal and transformed
cells, we next used immunohistochemical analysis to examine
expression specifically in epithelial precursors of lung adenocarci-
noma. A tissue microarray was constructed with punch biopsy
samples of lung tissues from KrasLA1 mice (normal lung, AAH,
adenoma, and adenocarcinoma). We observed staining for ErbB3
protein in the epithelial precursors but not in the adjacent normal
alveolar epithelium (Fig. 2B). The staining increased with histologic
progression from AAH to adenocarcinoma, indicating that the
increase in ErbB3 expression was linked to malignant progression.
We then used Q-PCR to examine the expression of ErbB ligands
in the same lung RNA samples analyzed for expression of ErbB
family members. The ligands epiregulin, epigen, and amphiregulin
were expressed at 23.0-, 7.5-, and 5.0-fold higher levels, respectively,
in KrasLA1 mice than in their wild-type littermates, whereas
h-cellulin, epidermal growth factor, diphtheria toxin receptor,
transforming growth factor-a, neuregulin-1, and neuregulin-2 were
expressed at levels similar to those in the wild-type mice (Fig. 2A).
Epiregulin binds to ErbB2/ErbB3 and ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodimers
with a moderate affinity and to ErbB1 homodimers and ErbB1/
ErbB2 heterodimers with weak affinity, whereas amphiregulin
binds selectively to ErbB1 (19). The ErbB-binding specificity of
epigen has not yet been reported.
Because ErbB3 can activate PI3K, we examined the Ser473 pAKT,
a downstream mediator of PI3K, as a marker of ErbB3 activation in
the lungs of KrasLA1 mice. We did immunohistochemical analysis of
epithelial precursor lesions using the same tissue microarray used
to examine ErbB3 expression. The degree of staining was
undetectable in normal alveolar epithelium and increased with
malignant progression (Fig. 2B and C). These data are consistent
with the conclusion that AKT phosphorylation increased as a
consequence of increased ErbB3 expression, but it is possible that
AKT phosphorylation increased through direct interactions of
mutant KRAS with PI3K, Ras-independent mechanisms, or both.
Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition decreased
expression of ErbB3 and ErbB ligands. We examined the effect
of gefitinib treatment on the expression of ErbB family members

and ErbB ligands in lung tissues of KrasLA1 mice. ErbB3 RNA levels
decreased markedly in mice treated with gefitinib (Fig. 3A).
Western blotting showed that gefitinib treatment was associated
with a decrease in Tyr1289 pErbB3, total ErbB3, and, to a lesser
extent, pAKT, but total EGFR expression did not change (Fig. 3B).
Amphiregulin and epiregulin RNA expression also decreased,
whereas the expression of epigen and the other ligands did not
measurably change (Fig. 3A).
We next investigated the effect of gefitinib treatment on ErbB3
expression and AKT phosphorylation in epithelial precursor lesions
by immunohistochemical analysis. A tissue microarray was
constructed with punch biopsy samples of lung tissues (normal
lung, AAH, and adenoma) from the mice treated in the above
gefitinib experiment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that
expression of ErbB3 and pAKT decreased with gefitinib treatment
(Fig. 3C). Together, these findings suggest that EGFR regulates the
expression of ErbB3 and the ligands epiregulin and amphiregulin,
which contribute to AKT phosphorylation and, possibly, lung
tumorigenesis in KrasLA1 mice.
High expression of ErbB3 and ErbB ligands in sensitive non–
small cell lung cancer cell lines. We investigated the expression
of ErbB3 and ErbB ligands in human lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines that have been characterized for somatic mutations in EGFR
and sensitivity to gefitinib (Table 1; ref. 8). With respect to
gefitinib sensitivity, cell lines were classified into one of three cate-
gories: highly sensitive (HCC827, H3255, and H4006), moderately
sensitive (H1819 and HCC2279), and resistant (H1299).
Relative to the gefitinib-resistant H1299 cells, the highly sensitive
cell lines HCC827, H3255, and H4006 and the moderately sensitive
cell line H1819 expressed high basal levels of EGFR, ErbB2, and
ErbB3 and the ligands amphiregulin and epiregulin (Fig. 4A).
Epiregulin levels were particularly enhanced in the highly sensitive
cells (up to 4.5  105–fold). Gefitinib treatment decreased
expression of pErbB3 and pAKT in the highly sensitive cell lines
(HCC827, H3255, and H4006) and in one (H1819) but not the other
(HCC2279) moderately sensitive cell line or in the gefitinib-
resistant cell line H1299 (Fig. 4B). All of the cell lines in which
pErbB3 and pAKT expression decreased had activating EGFR

mutations with the exception of H1819, which expressed high basal
ErbB2 and ErbB3 (Fig. 4A ; ref. 8). HCC2279 cells, which has an
EGFR mutation and is moderately sensitive to gefitinib, expressed
no detectable ErbB2 or ErbB3 and low AKT1 and AKT2 (Fig. 4A
and B). We analyzed EGFR in HCC2279 cells and found no evidence
of a T790M mutation, which was reported recently to confer
resistance to EGFR inhibition (20). Thus, gefitinib sensitivity in
human NSCLC cells correlated with the presence of EGFR
mutations and high basal expression of ErbB family members
and ErbB ligands, which decreased in response to EGFR inhibition.
The high expression of ErbB family members and their ligands in
gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cells was consistent with our findings in
KrasLA1 mice (Fig. 3).
Introduction of KRAS mutations is not sufficient to confer
resistance. In contrast to KrasLA1 mice that were sensitive to
gefitinib, patients with KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas were
reported to be gefitinib resistant (10). Therefore, we directly tested
the role of mutant KRAS in HBECs that had been immortalized by
the introduction of genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinase-4 and
human telomerase reverse transcriptase (21). KRAS/HBECs, which
have been transfected with a retroviral vector expressing mutant
KRAS , acquire enhanced anchorage-independent growth and
increased saturation density.7 We found that HBECs and KRAS/
HBECs were both moderately sensitive to the antiproliferative
effect of gefitinib treatment (IC50, 0.4 Amol/L). These findings
indicate that the introduction of mutant KRAS was not sufficient to
confer resistance to EGFR inhibition.
High expression of ErbB3 is associated with gefitinib
sensitivity. Given that high expression of ErbB3 was associated
with sensitivity to EGFR inhibition in KrasLA1 mice and human
lung adenocarcinoma cells, we hypothesized that patients with
high intratumoral ErbB3 levels in their pretreatment biopsy
samples would be more likely to respond to gefitinib than patients
with lower levels. We studied tumor samples from 42 patients with
lung adenocarcinoma who had been treated with gefitinib and from
whom there was sufficient tissue and clinical data available for
analysis. Patient demographics are summarized in Supplementary
Table S1. Patients were classified into three response categories,
including objective responders (4 patients with complete or partial
response), stable disease for at least 6 months (4 patients), and
progressive disease (34 patients).
We did mutational analysis of EGFR (exons 18-21) and KRAS
(codons 12, 13, and 61) on all samples, with the exception of 11
patients with progressive disease from whom there was inade-
quate tissue for DNA analysis (Table 2). We observed KRAS

mutations in tumors from patients with progressive disease [6 of
23 (26%)] and stable disease [1 of 4 (25%)] but not in responding
tumors. We observed EGFR mutations in responding tumors [3 of
4 (75%)] and those from patients with progressive disease [2 of 23
(8%)] but not in those from patients with stable disease.
Immunohistochemical analysis was done to quantify ErbB3
expression in biopsy samples using conditions that specifically
detected ErbB3 (Fig. 5A). ErbB3 expression was higher in tumors
from patients who achieved an objective response or stabilization
of disease than in those with progressive disease (Fig. 5B). Thus,
in this group of patients, EGFR mutational analysis did not
identify one of the four patients who achieved an objective
response or any of those whose disease stabilized. In contrast,
ErbB3 expression clearly segregated patients with progressive
disease from those who achieved tumor response or disease
stabilization after treatment.
Discussion
The findings presented here provide the first evidence that lung
adenocarcinoma cells that depend on EGFR for survival
constitutively activate the receptor through a combination of
genetic mutations and overexpression of EGFR dimeric partners
and their ligands. In KrasLA1 mice, high expression of ErbB3,
amphiregulin, and epiregulin in the lung was dependent on EGFR
activation. These findings suggest the presence of an autocrine
loop in which EGFR activates expression of ErbB3 and ErbB
ligands, which in turn activate EGFR. However, the introduction of
mutant EGFR into H1299 cells was not sufficient to increase the
expression of ErbB3, amphiregulin, or epiregulin, suggesting that
factors other than EGFR activation contributed to the high
expression of these proteins in NSCLC cells with somatically
acquired EGFR mutations.
Consistent with our findings in KrasLA1 mice, human tumor cells
with KRAS mutations express high levels of ErbB ligands (22–24).
The levels of ErbB3 mRNA are significantly higher in human lung
adenocarcinomas than in normal tissues (P < 0.001; ref. 25).
However, high ErbB3 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma
cells does not correlate with the presence of KRAS mutations (25).
Thus, lung adenocarcinomas arising in humans and KrasLA1 mice
differ with respect to the role of KRAS mutations in the regulation
of ErbB3 expression. Nevertheless, the observation that both mouse
and human lung adenocarcinomas have high expression of ErbB3
underscores its importance in tumorigenesis. Moreover, ErbB3 is
required to drive breast epithelial cell proliferation, and over-
expression of ErbB3 leads to the development of lung adenocarci-
nomas in mice and is associated with poor prognosis in patients
with NSCLC (26–28).
Several of our findings suggest that EGFR mutations are neither
sufficient nor required for sensitivity to EGFR inhibition and that
other ErbBs and ErbB ligands have an important role in this
sensitivity. First, gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cells had high expression
of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB ligands. Second, pharmacologic
inhibition of EGFR in KrasLA1 mice decreased the expression of
ErbB3, amphiregulin, and epiregulin and blocked the expansion of
alveolar epithelial neoplasia. Third, HCC2279 cells, which express
undetectable levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3, were only moderately
sensitive to gefitinib despite having an activating mutation in EGFR ;
in addition, they did not have the T790M EGFR mutation, which
confers resistance to EGFR inhibition (20). Fourth, H1819 cells,
which have no EGFR mutations and are moderately sensitive to

EGFR inhibition (8), expressed high levels of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3,
and ErbB ligands. However, stable cotransfection of H1299 cells with
ErbB3 and mutant (D746-750) EGFR was not sufficient to confer
gefitinib sensitivity (data not shown). Of note, gefitinib treatment
did not extinguish pAKT expression in H1299 cells (Fig. 4A). These
negative data make an important point: cells must depend on EGFR
and its downstream pathways for their survival to be sensitive to
EGFR inhibition. H1299 cells maintain their survival through EGFR-
independent mechanisms and thus remain gefitinib resistant
despite the introduction of mutant EGFR and ErbB3.
KRAS mutations in NSCLC occur most commonly in smokers,
who are typically resistant to the antitumor effects of EGFR TKIs.
Consistent with these findings, KRAS mutations have been linked
with de novo resistance to treatment with EGFR TKIs (10).
Similarly, we observed KRAS mutations in tumors from patients
who were resistant to EGFR inhibition. However, KrasLA1 mice were
sensitive to EGFR inhibition, and introduction of mutant KRAS into
HBECs did not measurably inhibit their sensitivity to gefitinib. In
addition, we observed KRAS mutations in one patient treated with
gefitinib who experienced prolonged stability of disease. Together,
these findings indicate that the presence of mutant KRAS is not
sufficient to confer resistance to EGFR inhibition in lung
adenocarcinoma cells.
EGFR mutations have been found in 30% to 60% of never
smokers (13). In the present study, EGFR mutations were more
common in never smokers and former smokers than in current
smokers (P = 0.002; Supplementary Table S1). Never smokers and
former smokers account for the vast majority of patients who
benefit from treatment with EGFR TKIs (1–5). However, these
studies identified patients with wild-type EGFR who have also
benefited from treatment with EGFR TKIs. Similarly, in the present
study, we observed wild-type EGFR in one patient who achieved an
objective response and in the four patients who had stable disease.
A large clinical trial of lung cancer patients treated with erlotinib
suggested that stabilization of disease is clinically meaningful, as
the survival benefit exceeded the observed rate of tumor response
(5). These findings indicate that factors other than EGFR mutations
contribute to sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. We found that
responding patients and those with stable disease could be
segregated from patients with progressive disease based on
intratumoral ErbB3 levels. Although these observations are
preliminary and should be tested in a larger population of patients
with lung adenocarcinoma, our data point to ErbB3 and ErbB
ligands as potentially important mediators of EGFR inhibition in
patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Analysis of the expression of
these molecules may complement EGFR mutational analysis as a
predictive marker of sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. Finally, although
the current clinical application of EGFR inhibition is targeted at
late-stage cancers, the response of the early neoplastic disease in
KrasLA1 mice to EGFR inhibition raises the possibility that TKIs
may be used to treat early-stage lung cancers in humans.
