ABSTRACT
Many methods for the detection of genomic DNA
methylation states have appeared. Currently,
nearly all such methods employ bisulfite-mediated
deamination of denatured DNA. While this treatment
effectively deaminates cytosines to uracils, leaving
most 5-methylcytosines intact, it also introduces
abasic sites that generate a significant number of
single-strand breaks in DNA. We have investigated
the interplay of these two processes in order to
determine their relative effects on the methylation-
sensitive QPCR method. The extent of cleavage of
the input DNA is significant and appears to be an
increasing function of DNA concentration. Even so,
the results suggest that only 10% of a 62-nt target
will be lost due to degradation and targets up to
131nt will suffer only a 20% loss. More significant
losses were found to occur during the subsequent
removal of bisulfite and desulfonation steps that
appear to be the result of size selectivity associated
with matrix binding and elution required prior to
QPCR in the most commonly used protocols. For
biospecimens yielding51kg of DNA, these findings
suggest that bisulfite treatment, in current imple-
mentations of MS-QPCR, result in low recoveries
that preclude reliable analysis of DNA methylation
patterns regardless of target size.
INTRODUCTION
In mammals, DNA methylation patterns are known to
be important hallmarks of both cell type and cellular
history. Patterns of methylation are maintained in a given
cell lineage (1) but alterations in these patterns are
associated with changes in gene expression (1), cellular
diﬀerentiation (2), gene rearrangement, telomere short-
ening, DNA damage, viral integration (3,4), carcinogen-
esis (5,6) and aging (7). Given these associations, a good
deal of eﬀort has been invested in developing methods
that can detect qualitative and quantitative changes in
methylation patterns as biomarkers of these processes.
The use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes
was employed early on (8) as a qualitative indicator of
methylation status, and methods of this type continue to
be developed (9).
Other early techniques employed hydrazine (10–12)
or potassium permanganate (13) DNA modiﬁcation for
genomic sequencing. However, since its introduction (14)
the use of bisulﬁte-treated DNA as a means of distin-
guishing methylated cytosine from unmethylated cytosine
in genomic applications has come into general use in the
ﬁeld. Certain artifacts can be avoided with highly puriﬁed
DNA (15), however, the nature of the bisulﬁte reaction
itself presents additional problems.
Bisulﬁte-mediated deamination of cytosine in DNA
occurs only at low pH, in a solution that is eﬀectively
dilute sulfurous acid (16–19). Chemically this is required
because of the low pKa of cytosine and the necessity for
protonation of the N3 ring nitrogen in order to produce
uracil or thymine from cytosine or 5-methylcytosine,
respectively. The reaction rate for cytosine to uracil is
much faster than the reaction rate for 5-methylcytosine to
thymine, making it possible to detect 5-methylcytosines
in biological samples as cytosine moieties that survive
treatment with mild sulfurous acid. Superimposed
on these reactions (Figure 1) is the tendency for the
glycosyl bond to undergo hydrolysis at sites of protonated
bases in DNA coupled with chain breakage (20). In this
case, base loss is rapidly followed by conversion to the
aldose and b-elimination resulting in chain breakage (21).
Many existing approaches to the analysis of methyla-
tion patterns now rely on bisulﬁte-treated DNA followed
by PCR ampliﬁcation. Of necessity, the use of this
reagent requires its removal prior to PCR ampliﬁcation.
This desulfonation step is generally accomplished by
exposing the DNA product to mild base coupled with
binding to and elution from a matrix. Moreover, most
work in cancer research has shown that no single gene can
suﬃce for accurate prediction of clinical diagnosis or
outcome. Thus, one is faced with the practical limitations
associated with testing multiple genes superimposed on

the limitations placed on these analyses by specimen size.
While this has led to the introduction of multiplex PCR,
mass spectroscopic systems and multigene array systems,
the fundamental reliance on the bisulﬁte-mediated
deamination of cytosine and subsequent puriﬁcation of
the product remains central to each of these techniques.
Quantitative PCR methods (22,23) have been intro-
duced that require reference sequences for quantiﬁcation
and as measures of the recovery of intact target DNA.
A number of diﬀerent reference standards have been used
in this application. However, relatively little information
is available on the exact utilization of these references
or their general performance. Moreover, there is little
information available on the eﬀects of the chemical
breakdown of the target DNA necessarily associated
with the bisulﬁte-catalyzed deamination reaction. In this
article, we have used cloned target sequences that
reproduce the expected bisulﬁte-converted target sequence
to quantify DNA recoveries in the widely employed
TaqMan quantitative PCR reaction. Our results show
that signiﬁcant losses occur during the chemical prepara-
tion of the DNA for QPCR and that these losses are
dependent on the starting concentration of the input
DNA. While signiﬁcant breakdown of the DNA occurs
during the bisulﬁte-mediated deamination reaction, the
losses appear to be dominated by the size-selectivity
imposed by the necessity of the matrix-binding and elution
step used during bisulﬁte removal and desulfonation.
The implications of these ﬁndings are discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human kidney 293 cells were grown as previously
described (24). PC3 cells were grown under the same
conditions except that the cells were grown in Kaighn’s
Nutrient Medium F12 (Irvine Scientiﬁc, Santa Ana, CA)
containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. PC3 cells were
passaged using 1X trypsin-EDTA, at 1:3–1:6.

bisulﬁte activates the cytosine ring for hydrolytic deamination and b-elimination to produce uracil. (B) A similar process deaminates 5-methylcytosine
at a much slower rate than that of cytosine. (C) Protonated bases created at low pH are removed from the DNA chain by glycosyl bond hydrolysis,
leading to chain breaks through aldose conversion and b-elimination.

DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was isolated using Qiagen’s QIAamp
DNA Blood Mini-Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The kit-recommended RNAse step was
included in order to remove contaminating RNA. The
ﬁnal concentration was determined by spectrophotometry.
Qiagen’s QIAamp DNA Blood Mini-Kit was used since
it is recommended for puriﬁcation of DNA from a variety
of tissues and bodily ﬂuids as well as cultured cells. For
the work described here the cultured-cell protocol in the
manual was used.
Bisulfite treatment
DNA was bisulﬁte treated using the EZ DNA
Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. In general,
200–1600 ng of genomic DNA was treated with bisulﬁte
at ﬁnal concentrations corresponding to 1.33–10.67 ng/ml
of genomic DNA. Assuming 100% recovery from the
desulfonation and puriﬁcation steps, that amount of
product containing 200 ng of genomic DNA was used
for PCR ampliﬁcation at a concentration of 8 ng/ml.
Sham-bisulfite treatment
DNA was sham-bisulﬁte treated by suspending it in the
EZ DNA Methylation Kit’s bisulﬁte reagent mixture
(Zymo Research, Orange, CA) that had been pre-mixed
with M-dilution buﬀer and the matrix-binding buﬀer
so as to prevent the normal hydroxide ion-induced
denaturation of the DNA. After a brief mixing it was
bound to the puriﬁcation matrix and eluted from the
matrix as described by the manufacturer.
Gel electrophoretic and microfluidics separation methods
These methods have been described previously (25–27).
The DNA 7500 LabChip was found to be most suited
to visualization of the molecular length distribution of
the bisulﬁte-treated DNAs. To corroborate estimates
of single-strand molecular lengths obtained with non-
denaturing microﬂuidics methodology, separations were
also performed on 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gels
containing 8M urea (20). RNA markers were used to
calibrate the polyacrylamide system. The number average
molecular weights were determined by use of densitometry
measurements on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel using
the method described in (24). However an improvement
was developed by using Scion Image (Scion Corporation,
Frederick, Maryland) to calculate the areas under the
curve.
Quantitative PCR
Duplex QPCR reactions used the following cycle proﬁle: 1
hold at 958C for 10min, followed by 50 cycles of: 958C for
15 s, 568C for 30 s, 728C for 30 s. Duplex PCR reactions
contained: 0.25 ml Qiagen Hotstar Taq, 2.5ml 10Qiagen
buﬀer (providing 1.5mM MgCl2), 320 mM dNTPs,
2.0mM added MgCl2 (to bring the ﬁnal MgCl2 concen-
tration to 3.5mM) 1.0 ml Q-Solution, 250 nM probe DNA,
900 nM each for forward and reverse primers DNA,
9.95ml H2O, 5.0 ml DNA. Uniplex QPCR reactions were
the same with the following exceptions: 2.5mM ﬁnal
MgCl2, 5 ml Q-solution. The ﬁnal reaction volume was
25 ml. QPCR conditions for detecting and quantifying
the unconverted sequence were identical except that the
annealing temperature was 608C.
Concentrations were determined from a standard curve
of the log[input DNA] versus Ct determined at a threshold
value providing the best eﬃciency value and linearity in
the semilog plot as determined by the Rotor Gene 3000
QPCR analysis software. Alternative methods of analysis
are under development but have not been implemented
here, with the following exception. It is important to note
that the plasmid standards have two complementary
strands while the genomic DNA targets have two non-
complementary strands once deamination is complete.
This means that only one of the two strands is ampliﬁed
in the bisulﬁte-mediated PCR. Because of this, the
standard curves run for an additional cycle compared to
the unknowns. To correct for this the standard curves
must be multiplied by a correction factor equal to
(1þE)1, where E is the eﬃciency of the standard curve.
Synthesis of primers and TAQMAN probes
Primers (Table 1) were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). All Q-PCR
probes (Table 1) were synthesized in-house on an
Expedite solid-phase DNA/RNA synthesizer on a 1.0mM
scale. The modiﬁed phosphoramidites (50-ﬂuorescein,
50-hexachloro-ﬂuorescein and Cy5), the modiﬁed
CPG-phosphoramidites (30-PT-Amino-Modiﬁer C6,
30-BHQ-1, 30-BHQ-3) and TAMRA NHS Ester were
purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). The
unmodiﬁed phosphoramidite monomers, with either
standard or mild protecting groups, along with DNA
solid supports and other reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Proligo (St. Louis, MO) and Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA). The synthesis and deprotection
conditions used, were those suggested by Glen Research
(Sterling, VA) for the corresponding reagent. HPLC
puriﬁcation was performed using a PRP-1 column in
TeBAA buﬀer (50mM tetrabutylammonium acetate
buﬀer, adjusted to pH 7.0 with acetic acid, in a gradient
of acetonitrile) or TEAA buﬀer (50mM triethylammo-
nium acetate buﬀer, adjusted to pH 7.0 with acetic acid in
a gradient of acetonitrile).
Synthesis and cloning of ideal standards
Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (Figure 2, Table 1) were
designed so that they corresponded to the deaminated
product expected for the CG-methylated or -unmethylated
sequence. In the unmethylated sequence, each of the
cytosines in the genomic sequence was converted to a
T in the synthetic DNA. In the methylated sequence,
all cytosines except those in CG dinucleotides were
converted to T. Short oligodeoxynucleotides were
annealed and converted to duplex DNAs by primer
extension. The resulting duplex molecules were treated
with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and
run on a 2% agarose gel. The duplexes were extracted
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 9 2895
from the gel using a Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The plasmid vector, pBluescript
II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), was linearized using
R.EcoRV (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) followed
by treatment with Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The plasmid DNA
was separated on a 1% agarose gel and the band
corresponding to the linearized DNA was gel extracted.
Ligation of the duplex fragment and the linear plasmid
DNA was carried out overnight at 168C using T4 ligase
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Blunt-end cloning
produced a set of plasmids each carrying an ideal
target standard. DNA sequencing was performed at the
DNA sequencing facility of the City of Hope Cancer
Center to conﬁrm each cloned sequence.
It is important to note here that bisulﬁte-mediated
deamination converts the two target strands so that they
are no longer complementary. Thus MS-PCR primers
are designed to target only one of the two strands of the
target duplex. For this reason, the sequences used in this
article correspond only to the target strand utilized in the
subsequent QPCR reaction.
Cloning of unconverted sequences
Unconverted target standard sequences used in the sham-
bisulﬁte treatment experiments were cloned into
Figure 2. Cloning ideal DNA target standards. Synthetic oligodeox-
ynucleotides were synthesized so that they corresponded to the
deaminated product expected for the methylated or unmethylated
sequence. In the unmethylated sequence, each of the cytosines in the
genomic sequence was converted to a T in the synthetic DNA. In the
methylated sequence, all cytosines except those in CG dinucleotides
were converted to T. Short oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed and
converted to duplex DNAs by primer extension. Blunt-end cloning
produced plasmids that carry the target standards. Direct DNA
sequencing was used to conﬁrm each sequence.

Cross reactivity experiments
For each gene target, primers and probes designed to
detect the methylated target were tested in the QPCR
reaction to determine whether or not they would amplify
the ideal unmethylated standard at a given input copy
number and vice versa. QPCR conditions were as given
above.
Search path recovery experiments
In order to increase the search path encountered by the
Taq polymerase in binding to an appropriate primer
initiation site, increasing amounts of genomic DNA
lacking the target sequence (e.g. Micrococcus lysodeikticus
DNA which does not contain an ampliﬁable unmethylated
target) were added to the plasmid DNA containing the
ideal target sequence. Here, 200 fg of plasmid DNA was
used with 200 ng of M. lysodeikticus DNA to provide the
same amount of single-copy target that would be present
in 200 ng of bisulﬁte-treated human DNA (i.e. 60 838
copies for a diploid gene).
Sham-treated genomic DNA
High molecular weight DNA was subjected to sham-
bisulﬁte treatment for 51min by adding it to bisulﬁte
reagent pre-mixed with M-dilution buﬀer and matrix-
binding buﬀer so as to prevent hydroxide-ion-induced
denaturation of the DNA. It was then subjected to matrix
puriﬁcation and ampliﬁcation using the unconverted
QPCR primers and probes described above. Since
deamination is not expected to occur under these
conditions the unmodiﬁed plasmid clones described
above were diluted appropriately for the construction of
the standard curves in these experiments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In many cases specimen size is not limiting, thus for
many purposes bisulﬁte treatment of 0.25–4 mg of DNA
is recommended, (18,28–30) however, serum and other
clinical samples rarely contain this much DNA and quite
often bisulﬁte treatment has been carried out on less than
50 ng of DNA (31). Given these constraints, multiplex
reactions are generally used to conserve specimen.
Although we obtained similar results throughout this
study with uniplex or duplex reactions we report only the
results with duplex reactions for simplicity. To study this
reaction, we cloned synthetic versions of the desired target
sequence (Figure 2) as recovery standards. These cloned
targets are useful in assessing the properties of the reaction
in a number of ways.
Cross reactivities
In order to investigate the details of this reaction, it is
important to establish that the reactions designed to
measure only methylated or unmethylated state of a gene
do not cross react. The results of experiments designed
to investigate this possibility for each of four commonly
used biomarker detection systems (Table 2), are depicted
in Figure 3. Here, it is seen that the system is highly
selective with cross reactivity accounting for a negligible
amount of signal.
Overall recoveries
The existence of the competing reactions depicted in
Figure 1 suggests that signiﬁcant losses of the desired
product can occur, and a priori one might suspect that
losses would be a function of input concentration. Thus,
we began our experiments by treating 200 ng of DNA with
bisulﬁte. When plasmids containing the desired target
sequence (i.e. the sequence expected at the targeted region
once complete deamination of the cytosine residues
is achieved) were used as copy number standards, we
found that recovery was very low and gene-target speciﬁc
(Table 2). That is to say, once the primer sequences were
chosen, and primer concentrations and cycle times were
optimized for the PCR portion of the reaction, the amount
of recoverable input deaminated target sequence was
dependent on the cell line used and the gene target. Total
recovery for a given gene (i.e. the sum of the copies
observed from the methylated (M) and the unmethylated (U)
targets) was 5% of the input and varied slightly with the
gene target used (Table 2). Moreover, considerable scatter
in the data was observed with input levels at or below
200 ng of genomic DNA. Standard deviations in
the observed recovery were on the order of the measure-
ment itself. Recovery in this initial set of experiments
was scaled to the expected number of copies present
in 200 ng of genomic DNA (60 838 copies for a given
single-copy target taken as 100%). This method is open
to errors due to inaccuracies in DNA concentration
measurement, and subsequent recovery experiments were
scaled to the number of copies of the unconverted
sequence measured by QPCR (see below).
Search path recovery experiments
One possible explanation for the low overall recovery
of target in these experiments is the relative amount
of non-target DNA in the plasmid-borne standards
compared to the genomic DNA. In eﬀect, the primers
and Taq polymerase can be viewed as being forced to
search through considerably more non-target genomic
DNA to initiate copying, than they are forced to search
through in the standard reactions containing the shorter
plasmid target DNA population. Since human DNA
contains the target sequence, we used M. lysodeikticus
DNA as competitor in experiments designed to detect a
decrease of signal associated with DNA seeded with
single-copy levels of plasmid DNA target. A 10–12%

decrease in signal was detected (data not shown). This
ﬁnding is not completely unexpected since in most QPCR
work this eﬀect is generally oﬀset by the high input
concentrations of both Taq polymerase and primers.
Clearly this cannot account for the considerable losses
we observe.
Sham-treated DNA
In initial attempts at developing a baseline for recovery
estimates we attempted to sham treat the DNA with the
bisulﬁte reagents. Here, DNA was exposed to the bisulﬁte
reagent for as brief a period as possible (generally
a maximum of 30 s) before beginning the desulfonation
and matrix puriﬁcation step. As noted by others (18,21)
the conversion can be very rapid. We detected signiﬁcant
amounts of both the converted (i.e. deaminated) and
unconverted DNA using the converted and unconverted
primer-probe PCR systems for the APC promoter even
at short times of exposure, and high input DNA levels
(1600 ng). Thus we were unable to use the sham-treated
DNA as a baseline for unconverted input levels.
Nevertheless, we were able to determine the extent of
the reaction at 16 h of exposure to the bisulﬁte reagent
using the unconverted primer probe system for the APC
reaction. With the full 16 h of incubation, very little signal
could be recovered with this PCR system suggesting
that the DNA has been completely converted to the
deaminated form by the treatment, whereas the signal
from the converted primer probe system was signiﬁcant.
For example, with 1600 ng of genomic DNA (the highest
amount used in these experiments), after 16 h of exposure
to the bisulﬁte reagent 30% of the input copies were
recovered with the converted primer probe system while
only 2% copies could be detected with the unconverted
primer probe system.
Measured recoveries of bisulfite-treated DNA
The two competing reactions described above operate
to deaminate all cytosine residues while minimizing
the breakdown of the DNA. Both reactions are very
rapid with complete conversion of all cytosines to uracils
in as little as 20min (18,19) and extensive degradation
of the DNA occurring over the same time period. Both
deamination and DNA degradation appear to be fast
(18,19). To assess the degree of degradation, we deter-
mined the size of the bisulﬁte-treated DNA. Untreated
DNA ranged in molecular length from 42 000–25 000 bp
with a weak smear of smaller DNA fragments that had
been sheared during DNA isolation extending to lower
molecular lengths, however, bisulﬁte-treated DNA was
extensively degraded. Figure 4A depicts the
observed molecular weight range for the bisulﬁte-treated
DNA as determined by microﬂuidics-based capillary
electrophoresis.
This proﬁle allows us to estimate the probability that
single strands from the PCR target will be broken by
base loss and subsequent strand-scission (Figure 1).
The distribution of fragment lengths created by random
breaks in denatured DNA is given by Equation (1) for
a genome of length L (32,33), where f is the frequency of
random breaks, and FW(L) is the weight fraction L:
FWðLÞ ¼
R L
0 Lf
2efLdLR
0 Lf
2efLdL
FWðLÞ ¼ 1 ð1þ fLÞefL
1
As previously reported (24), the number average
molecular length (LN¼ 1/f) of the distribution of frag-
ments occurs at 26% of the area of the distribution
measured from zero molecular weight (24):
FW(LN)¼ 1 (1þ 1)e1¼ 0.26. For the distribution
observed after bisulﬁte treatment, matrix binding and
elution (Figure 4A), LN corresponds to the position of
a 900-bp electrophoretic standard. Our experience with
the microﬂuidics separation system is that single-stranded
DNA runs 25% slower on average than duplex DNA of
the same length. Thus the frequency (f ) of single-strand
breaks is about 1/(LN 0.25LN) or 675 nt if the DNA is
completely denatured prior to bisulﬁte treatment.
To conﬁrm this result, we separated the bisulﬁte-treated
DNA under denaturing conditions using 5% polyacryla-
mide and 8M urea (20). As can be seen from Figure 4B,
the estimated number average molecular length using
this single-stranded separation system yielding an
estimate of 587 nt for the number average molecular
weight of the bisulﬁte-treated DNA based on four
measurements with a range of 403–827 nt. Given these
results, the probability (P) that a single-stranded target
sequence of length L will not be broken by bisulﬁte
treatment is given by:
P ¼ ð1 fÞL ﬃ efL 2
For the APC target under study here:
f ﬃ 1=587 nt and L ¼ 84 nt: Thus: P ﬃ 0:87
This implies that we should expect only a 13% loss of the
APC target simply due to bisulﬁte-promoted breakdown
of the DNA. Clearly, the calculated expectations for loss
due to bisulﬁte-mediated breakdown do not reﬂect the
experimental results (Table 2).
To study this loss in more detail, we used the APC
system targeting HK293 genomic DNA. We expect the
additional loci studied to behave similarly since recoveries
from GstP1 and APC loci were similarly low (Table 2).
However, the APC system in HK293 cells was chosen for
detailed analysis because it is completely unmethylated
in the target region as determined by both the direct
sequencing of bisulﬁte-converted clones (24) and the
QPCR method described here (Table 2). This permits
the recovery of unmethylated DNA to be scaled against
the experimental QPCR value obtained with the
unconverted sequence, thus obviating possible errors in
determination of the concentration of the genomic DNA
associated with spectrophotometry. As can be seen from
Figure 5, PCR signal recovered at any concentration of
bisulﬁte-treated DNAs was much less than the 87%
expected from bisulﬁte-mediated breakdown frequency
measured at higher concentrations. In fact it was
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 9 2899
dependent on the concentration of DNA present during
bisulﬁte treatment. One might suspect that bisulﬁte-
mediated single-strand breaks might somehow be involved
in the low recoveries observed in Figure 5. This would
require that the rate of bisulﬁte-mediated breakdown be
actually more extensive at low concentrations of input
DNA. However, this actually runs counter to the known
properties of the reaction (18). Taken together, these
considerations lead one to suspect that size selectivity
at the binding and elution step employed in the removal
of the bisulﬁte from the reaction prior to QPCR are
responsible for losses experienced in the process.
Size selection in binding and elution during desulfonation
Assume that there is a lower limit Ll below which the
DNA does not bind to the matrix, and an upper limit Lu
above which DNA fragments bind to the matrix but
cannot be eluted from it. In this case, the recoverable
weight fraction ðF CTR Þ is given by:
FCTR ¼ FCTW ðLuÞ  FCTW ðLlÞ 3

microﬂuidics chips as previously described (26). Representative results depicted in virtual scan format were replotted to display the proﬁle on a linear
molecular length scale. (B) Bisulﬁte-treated DNA was separated by PAGE using 8M urea to prevent secondary structure formation. Both methods
give approximately the same value for the number average molecular weight of single-stranded DNA fragments. Note the diﬀerences in abscissas on
the two graphs result from the diﬀerences between the two methods. The microﬂuidics system yields molecular lengths calculated from retention
times for duplex DNA markers in base pairs. The standard denaturing electrophoresis system is measured in distance from the origin calibrated
against RNA markers in nucleotides. The direction of electrophoresis is from left to right in both graphs.

This relationship provides a reasonably good ﬁt of
the data (Figure 4A) when Lu¼ 7500 nt, Ll¼ 75 nt, and
f¼ 1/587 nt¼ 0.0017 nt1, although there is still a sig-
niﬁcant deviation from the observed data points at low
input concentrations.
Apparently the assumption that the cleavage frequency
f is independent of DNA concentration over the range
tested is not borne out by the data. On the other hand,
f can be considered to be a function of input DNA
concentration [CT] and time t if all other reaction
components are constant (e.g. pH, bisulﬁte concentration,
etc). In this case, df=dt ¼ k½CT and for any constant

As can be seen from Figure 5B this approach gives a much
better ﬁt to the CT data. We interpret this to mean that
a smaller fraction of the DNA is broken down to the size
selection window of the matrix at lower input DNA
concentration, compounding the losses at low DNA
concentration, and generating the sigmoid nature of the
recovery curve in Figure 5B. To test this possibility, we
performed the complete deamination reaction at high
DNA concentration (800 ng input DNA) and then put
the equivalent of 200 ng through the binding and elution
step at the same time that we put the equivalent of 800 ng
of the same reaction product through the binding
and elution step. In this experiment, the recovery of the
target DNA from the 800-ng input specimen was 5.8%,
or 2-fold improvement over the 2.6% recovery observed
when 200 ng of DNA is bisulﬁte treated and subjected
to matrix binding and elution. Clearly losses due to the
performance of the matrix binding and elution step
outweigh those due to single-strand breakdown.
In the ﬁnal experiment, we investigated the eﬀect
of carrier DNA on recoveries. Here, 1200 ng of
M. lysodeikticus DNA was added to 800 ng of genomic
DNA either before bisulﬁte treatment or after bisulﬁte
treatment but before matrix puriﬁcation. Carrier DNA
added in either mode actually diminished target recovery
(data not shown), suggesting that this approach is not
helpful.
CONCLUSION
While at least one report of the extent and rapidity of the
degradation of DNA by bisulﬁte has appeared (21),
the extent of this side reaction has not been fully
appreciated in the studies of DNA methylation.
Moreover, studies on the eﬀect of this side reaction on
the MS-QPCR have not been reported. In this article,
we have shown that the degradation of bisulﬁte-treated
DNA is extensive, and that additional and even more
extensive losses occur at the required puriﬁcation step
Figure 5. Recovery of target sequence from bisulﬁte-treated genomic
DNA. High molecular weight DNA was subjected to bisulﬁte
treatment, matrix puriﬁcation and ampliﬁcation using the duplex
QPCR. Serial dilution of the plasmid standards was used to construct
a standard curve for recovery of genomic target DNA from a cell line
(HK293) in which the target APC gene is completely unmethylated.
Target DNA recovery is plotted as a function of initial DNA concen-
tration receiving bisulﬁte treatment and matrix puriﬁcation. That
portion of the recovered volume that would represent 200 ng of DNA
(assuming 100% recovery at these two steps) was subjected to PCR
ampliﬁcation. A separate PCR reaction was performed using the
unconverted primer/probe system to obtain an experimental value for
full recovery of the target. Each point is the average of 10 determina-
tions of the ratio of the observed unmethylated copy number to the
unconverted copy number Error bars indicate 1 S.D. (A) Analytical

prior to QPCR. The use of the cloned standards described
here permitted quantiﬁcation of these losses.
While variations in bisulﬁte treatment have been
employed in the literature the most commonly used
methods employing real-time MS-QPCR are similar
to the method studied here (34–39). A variety of
endpoint analyses have also been employed where
a semi-quantitative determination can be made
at high cycle number, see for example (22,30,40,41).
These methods may avoid the diﬃculties associated with
low target sequence recoveries by nested PCR (41) or
high-cycle endpoint analysis. TaqMan MS-QPCR meth-
ods however are likely to be more aﬀected by this problem
since quantiﬁcation generally depends on low-cycle
analysis in the log-linear range of the exponential increase
in measured reaction product.
Even so, several methods have appeared that avoid
the matrix puriﬁcation step identiﬁed as a key diﬃculty
in the recovery of low amounts of DNA. For example,
good recovery of low input DNA has been achieved with
centrifugal ﬁltration (42) in place of matrix puriﬁcation.
Moreover, performing the bisulﬁte treatment in agarose
has also been reported to avoid matrix puriﬁcation
and give good recoveries with nested PCR (43). These
two approaches may well avoid the losses reported here,
although they appear not to have been implemented as
TaqMan MS-QPCR analyses. A third approach (44),
utilizing nitrocellulose-membrane-bound DNA and
hybridization detection of digoxigenin-labeled probes
with anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments, obviates not
only the matrix puriﬁcation step but also the PCR. This
system is reported to have qualitative sensitivities beyond
those observed here.
In general, MS-QPCR reactions are calibrated with
in vitro methylated genomic DNA from a cell line or from
isolated human lymphocytes (29). In this calibration
method, the mycoplasmal methyltransferase M SssI is
used in excess to completely methylate all CG sites in the
genomic DNA methylation standard. Completeness of
methylation can be checked with bacterial restriction
enzymes. Alternatively, DNA from a cell line known to
be completely methylated at the locus of interest can be
used as a standard (45). As a rule, 1 mg of this standard
is treated with bisulﬁte. The recovered product is then
serially diluted and ampliﬁed to produce the standard
curve. Our data show that this method will not be accurate
when the available biological specimen DNA is not
equal to the amount used in the bisulﬁte treatment of
the in vitro methylated DNA. Since this number is
generally 1 mg, a signiﬁcant under-estimation of the
actual amount of target DNA will occur when the
available biological sample is 51 mg. Moreover, these
methods only permit the estimation of the level of
methylated DNA. Quantiﬁcation of the amount of
unmethylated DNA at the same locus is not often
performed in part because a genomic DNA specimen
that is completely unmethylated at multiple loci is
generally unavailable. Most often, DNA recovery is
monitored by ampliﬁcation of a locus devoid of CG
sites. The recovery at this locus (often b-actin or MyoD)
is then taken as the denominator in computing a
methylation ratio. Here again errors can arise in tumor
specimens where clastic changes like DNA ampliﬁcation
or deletion often occur. Moreover, if care is not taken in
matching the target lengths of the various genes to that
of the recovery locus, diﬀerent amounts of each target will
be degraded during the bisulﬁte treatment.
Using the cloned standards and the method described
here one is able to compute the ratio of methylated DNA
to that of total DNA (methylatedþunmethylated
DNA) at the locus in question. This method avoids
potential artifacts that can occur when the M SssI
standard and the specimen DNAs are not treated with
bisulﬁte at the same input concentrations as the specimens
(Figure 5), and provides an internal control for possible
ampliﬁcation, loss of heterozygosity, insertion deletion or
repeat expansion at a given locus in genetic diseases
and cancer. We prefer the use of cloned standards as
opposed to synthetic duplexes which might also serve as
standards because plasmid stocks are easily stored and
can be easily exchanged between laboratories at almost
negligible cost. Thus the use of these cloned standards
broadens the scope of the MS-QPCR method and permits
it to be more accurately applied.
Finally, in designing MS-QPCR experiments we have
found the equation P¼ e0.0017L can be used to determine
the probability P that a target of length L will survive
bisulﬁte treatment, under the conditions described here.
