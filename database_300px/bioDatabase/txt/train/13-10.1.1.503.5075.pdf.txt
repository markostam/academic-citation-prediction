ABSTRACT
DNA base flipping is an important mechanism
in molecular enzymology, but its study is limited
by the lack of an accessible and reliable diagnostic
technique. A series of crystalline complexes of a
DNA methyltransferase, M.HhaI, and its cognate
DNA, in which a fluorescent nucleobase analogue,
2-aminopurine (AP), occupies defined positions
with respect the target flipped base, have been pre-
pared and their structures determined at higher
than 2 A˚ resolution. From time-resolved fluorescence
measurements of these single crystals, we have
established that the fluorescence decay function of
AP shows a pronounced, characteristic response to
base flipping: the loss of the very short (100 ps)
decay component and the large increase in the
amplitude of the long (10 ns) component. When AP
is positioned at sites other than the target site, this
response is not seen. Most significantly, we have
shown that the same clear response is apparent
when M.HhaI complexes with DNA in solution, giving
an unambiguous signal of base flipping. Analysis
of the AP fluorescence decay function reveals con-
formational heterogeneity in the DNA–enzyme com-
plexes that cannot be discerned from the present
X-ray structures.
INTRODUCTION
The DNA double helix is a dynamic structure that undergoes
conformational change in response to interaction with agents
such as enzymes and drugs. A particularly remarkable
example of localized conformational distortion is the phenom-
enon of base flipping, induced by DNA methyltransferase
enzymes (Figure 1a). This involves 180 rotation of the target
nucleotide around the phosphate backbone, out of the DNA
helix and into the reactive site of the enzyme. Base flipping
was first observed by X-ray crystallography for the bacterial
C5-cytosine methyltransferase, M.HhaI (1) and subsequently
for other methyltransferases [M.HaeIII (2) and M.TaqI (3)]
and various DNA repair enzymes (4), including recently the
human proteins AGT (5) and oxoG interacting with undam-
aged DNA (6).
Recognition and modification of specific residues in DNA is a
key event in many cellular processes. The methylation by DNA
methyltransferases of cytosine and adenine nucleotides within
specific DNA sequences is found in many organisms from
bacteria to man and fulfils many functions including gene regu-
lation, genomic imprinting, chromatin remodelling and the
marking ofhost chromosomal DNA at specific target sequences.
This last process is widespread in bacteria and protects the
bacterial DNA from degradation by host restriction endonuc-
leases that destroy invading viral DNA containing unmethyl-
ated target sequences (7). Aberrations in cytosine methylation
correlate with human genetic disease and, therefore, methyl-
transferases are potent candidate targets for developing new
therapies (8). All methyltransferases have a common catalytic
core, and it is believed that they will all use base flipping to gain
access to the nucleotide targeted for methylation (9).
Base flipping seems likely to be a fundamental mechanism
of DNA–enzyme interaction in situations where bases need to
be covalently modified or removed, or where the DNA helix is
to be opened up for replication or transcription. To date, X-ray
crystallography of protein–DNA complexes has been relied

upon for absolute proof of base flipping. However, co-
crystallization of proteins with their DNA substrates is difficult
and time consuming, and in some cases might be impossible;
the number of crystal structures determined remains small. An
alternative method to unambiguously detect base flipping in
aqueous solution is essential for extending studies of this phe-
nomenon.
The fluorescent analogue of adenine, 2-aminopurine (AP),
would appear to be an ideal probe of DNA–enzyme interac-
tions. The fluorescence of AP is strongly quenched within the
structure of double-stranded DNA, but is enhanced if the base
stacking or base pairing is perturbed. Such perturbations of
duplex structure are caused by protein binding and AP emis-
sion intensity has been used to monitor DNA polymerase
reactions (10), helicase activity (11) and the action of DNA
repair enzymes (12–15) and methyltransferases (16–20). How-
ever, to date, AP has proved less than ideal as a probe of base
flipping. Some methyltransferases cause a dramatic increase
in fluorescence intensity when they bind to a DNA duplex
containing AP at the target site for methylation (16–20), whilst
others do not (21,22). In some cases, AP located at sites other
than the methylation site show changes in fluorescence intens-
ity even though these sites should not undergo base flipping
(21,22). The ambiguity of these results reflects the fact that a
change in AP emission intensity merely indicates some local
distortion of the DNA helix and is not specific to a particular
type of structural change, such as base flipping. In contrast, the
form of the fluorescence decay function is a precise and
responsive probe of the local molecular environment and,
as we demonstrate here, can be used as an unequivocal indic-
ator of base flipping of AP.
We have solved X-ray structures and made the first time-
resolved fluorescence measurements of single crystals of
AP-labelled-DNA duplexes complexed with M.HhaI. This
has allowed us to identify a pronounced, characteristic
response of the fluorescence decay function of AP to base
flipping. Furthermore, we have shown that this response con-
stitutes an unambiguous signature of base flipping in solution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
M.HhaI methyltransferase was overexpressed and purified
as described previously (23). 2AP-labelled oligonucleotides
were obtained from Fermentas (Lithuania) and MWG Biotech
(Germany).
The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the solution
phase studies were 50-GACTGGTACAGTATCAGGPGCTG-
ACCCACAACATCCG/50-TCGGATGTTGTGGGTCAGMG-
CCTGATACTGTACCAGT (APtarget); 50-GACAGTATCAG-
GCGCCGCCCCACAA/50-GTTGTGGGGPGGMGCCTGAT-
ACTGT (APout); 50-ACTGGTACAGTATCAGGCGCTGAC-
CCACAACATCTG/50-CAGATGTTGTGGGTCAGMPCCT-
GATACTGTACCAGT (APopp) and 50-GACTGGTACAG-
TATCAGPCGCTGACCCACAACATCCG/50-TCGGATGTT-
GTGGGTCAGMGCCTGATACTGTACCAGT(APadj);where
P is AP and M is 5-methyl cytosine. The target site of M.HhaI is
underlined. Oligonucleotide strands were annealed using a 10%
excess of the non-fluorescent strand to ensure that none of the
AP-labelled strand was left unbound in the final solution. In
order to ensure complete binding of the DNA by M.HhaI, sam-
ples were prepared containing 1 mM DNA duplex, 3 mM M.HhaI
(T250G mutant) and 100 mM cofactor [Kd for the ternary DNA–
HhaI–AdoHcy complex is 4.2 pM (24)]. The buffer used was 10
mM Tris–HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl, pH of 7.4. The
cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) was used in experi-
ments on the APtarget duplex, whereas the cofactor analogue S-
adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy) was used with the APout
duplex in order to prevent methylation of the target cytosine
base and subsequent dissociation of the enzyme from the duplex.
Crystals were grown using sitting-drop vapour diffusion at
19C. The enzyme (wild-type for APout, APadj and APopp
crystals and T250G mutant for APtarget crystal) was mixed
with an oligonucleotide duplex and AdoHcy at a 1:1.2:1.5
molar ratio and a final protein concentration of 7 mg/ml.
The sequences of the duplexes were 50-TGTCAGPGCATCC/
50-TGGATGMGCTGAC (APtarget), 50-TGTCAGCGCCGCC/
50-TGGPGGMGCTGAC (APout), 50-TGTCAGCGCATCC/

with an equal volume of well solution (50 mM sodium citrate,
pH 5.6, 1.2–2.0 M ammonium sulfate and 0–15% glucose).
Single rhombohedral crystals were harvested by washing thor-
oughly with the well solution. For X-ray diffraction studies
crystals were soaked for several seconds in a cryobuffer con-
taining 25% glycerol and flash-frozen at 90 K in a gaseous
nitrogen stream.
Diffraction data collection and structure determination
Diffraction datasets were collected from single crystals at 90 K
at the ESRF, Grenoble, France or at the DORIS storage ring,
EMBL-DESY, Hamburg, Germany. Data were processed with
MOSFLM (25) and further processed using SCALA (26) and
TRUNCATE (27) from CCP4 (28) package. The structure was
solved by molecular replacement using the protein backbone
of the previously solved ternary complex (PDB entry 3mht) as
the initial model. For initial phasing, 7.0 s spheres around the
key structural elements (residue 250 and the AP base) were
omitted from phase calculation to avoid model bias. Only
elements present in the omitted densities were built back into
the model. Models were adjusted manually using O (29) in
SIGMAA-weighted (30) maps with phases calculated from the
models and refined with the CNS package (31). Data collection
and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Time-resolved fluorescence measurements
Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy was performed
using the technique of time-correlated single photon counting.
The solution and crystal phase samples were measured in an
Edinburgh Instruments spectrometer equipped with TCC900
photon counting electronics. Single crystals were mounted in
quartz capillary tubes of 1 mm diameter (Hampton Research).
Solution samples were contained in fused silica microcuvettes
of volume 0.16 ml (Optiglass Ltd). The excitation source was a
Ti-Sapphire femtosecond laser system (Coherent, 10 W Verdi
and Mira Ti-Sapphire) producing pulses of 200 fs at 76 MHz
repetition rate. The output of the Ti-Sapphire laser was passed
through a pulse picker to reduce the repetition rate to 4.75 MHz
and then frequency tripled to give an output at 320 nm. The
emission from the sample was collected orthogonal to the
excitation direction through a polarizer set at the magic
angle with respect to the vertically polarized excitation. The
fluorescence was passed through a monochromator (bandpass
10 nm), then detected by a Hamamatsu microchannel plate
photomultiplier (R3809U-50). The instrument response of the
system, measured using a Ludox scatterer for solution phase
measurements and a frosted quartz plate for the crystalline
samples, was 50 ps FWHM.
Fluorescence decay curves were recorded on a timescales
of 20 and 50 ns, resolved into 4096 channels, to a total of
10 000 counts in the peak channel. Decay curves were
analysed using a standard iterative reconvolution method,
assuming a multiexponential decay function in the following

Fluorescence was excited at 320 nm and decay curves recor-
ded at three emission wavelengths, 370, 390 and 410 nm. The
three decays were analysed globally using Edinburgh Instru-
ments Level 2 software, i.e. they were fitted simultaneously,

was judged on the basis of the reduced c2-statistic, c2, and the
randomness of residuals.
RESULTS
Crystal structures
Crystal structures were determined for ternary complexes of
M.HhaI, a cofactor analogue (AdoHcy) and four different
AP-labelled DNA duplexes, APout, APtarget, APadj and
APopp. In APout, the AP was inserted at a position outside
the M.HhaI recognition sequence; in APtarget, AP was placed
at the target site for base flipping; in APadj, AP was adjacent to
the target base; in APopp, AP was the pairing partner of the
target base on the opposite strand. The sequences of the 10 bp
at the centre of the duplexes are shown in Figures 1b and 3a. The
recognition sequence of M.HhaI, 50-GCGC-30, is palindromic
so that the enzyme will methylate the 50 cytosine residue in the
recognition sequence on either of the DNA strands. Therefore,
to direct enzyme binding to the target base, a methylated
cytosine base is used in the other strand.
The crystal structures of the APout–M.HhaI(wild-type)–
AdoHcy and APtarget–M.HhaI(T250G mutant)–AdoHcy
complexes are shown in Figure 1c. When AP is outside the
recognition sequence it remains stacked and paired within the
DNA duplex, while the cytosine target base is flipped out.
When AP is at the target site, it is flipped out of the DNA
helix and into the catalytic cleft of the bilobal enzyme. The
flipped out AP base is bound in a slightly different position
than that observed with cytosine, uracil or adenine at the target
(32). The enzyme embraces and stabilizes the duplex structure
around the flipped out base, using its mobile catalytic loop
such that the flipped out AP is tightly locked in a polar cavity
with no access to bulk solvent. The base makes contacts to the
side chains of R165, R163, the phosphate of the 50Gua on the
same strand and a bound water molecule, as shown in Figure 2.
The structures of the APadj–M.HhaI(wild-type)–AdoHcy
and APopp–M.HhaI(wild type)–AdoHcy complexes are shown
in Figure 3b. In both cases, the AP base remains intrahelical
when the neighbouring cytosine is flipped out. In the APopp
complex, the enzyme infiltrates the duplex via the glutamine
237 and serine 87 residues which hydrogen bond with the N1
and N2 atoms of the orphan (unpaired) AP, respectively, as
shown in Figure 3c. In the normal recognition sequence, where
the orphan base is guanine, the O6 and N1 atoms of the base
are mainly involved in interactions with glutamine 237 (1). In
the APadj complex, the AP forms a ‘wobble’ base pair with
cytosine. The enzyme maintains the fidelity of this base pair
during flipping, through interaction of arginine 240 and iso-
leucine 86 with the AP, as shown in Figure 3c.
Establishing the response of AP to base flipping
To establish the photophysical response of AP to base flipping,
we compare the fluorescence decay of the APout complex,
characteristic of the unflipped AP base, with that of the APtar-
get complex, characteristic of AP flipped out of the DNA helix
into the enzyme active site. There is a dramatic qualitative
difference between the two decay functions (Figure 1d)
illustrating the sensitivity of the AP probe to its molecular
environment.
The decay of the APout complex (unflipped AP) is multi-
exponential, requiring four lifetime components to give a sat-
isfactory fit (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1). Although
the crystal is ostensibly homogeneous, with each identical
duplex containing a single AP base in the same sequence
position, the 4-component decay shows that AP experiences

a heterogeneous environment. This signifies the existence of at
least four conformational states of DNA in the crystal. There
may be additional shorter decay components that are beyond
the time resolution of our experiments, but these make neg-
ligible contribution to the fluorescence intensity. The A-factors
(Ai in Equation 1) indicate the fraction of the emitting AP
population with a given lifetime and hence the fractional
population of each conformational state. Modelling of the
decay function by a continuous distribution of fluorescence
lifetimes confirms the existence of four well-defined emitting
populations whose mean lifetimes are well represented by
the individual exponential decay components. It is, therefore,
physically realistic to describe the AP decays by discrete
lifetimes, recognizing that each lifetime represents a
distribution.
One conformation of APout is dominant, occupied by
65% of the duplexes, and has a very short fluorescence
lifetime of 70 ps. This can be identified with a strongly stacked
structure in which AP is efficiently quenched by electron
transfer from adjacent guanine bases (33). Intrastrand electron
transfer from guanine to excited AP occurs in tens of pico-
seconds (34), consistent with the measured decay time. The
longest lifetime component of 7.4 ns is similar to that of free
AP in moderately polar solution (e.g. in ethanol) (35,36) and is
characteristic of AP free from interbase interactions, in an
extrahelical environment. Only 3% of duplexes are in this
conformation and, therefore, make negligible contribution
to the X-ray structure. The conformational states with inter-
mediate lifetimes remain undefined, although they must be
imperfectly stacked as they are not subject to rapid electron
transfer quenching. The crystal structure clearly shows that the
AP base is paired with guanine and stacked within the DNA
helix, consistent with the observation that most of the AP bases
undergo a short 70 ps decay. Although the structure is of the
highest resolution (1.9 s) reported for any methyltransferase–
DNA complex to date, it is unable to reveal the minor, imper-
fectly stacked conformational states (37).
The fluorescence decay parameters of the APtarget complex
(Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2) very clearly report the
change in environment of the AP base when it is flipped into
the catalytic cleft of the enzyme (Figure 2). The very short
decay component characteristic of strongly stacked intrahel-
ical AP is absent, and the majority (77%) of flipped out AP
bases show a long lifetime of 10.9 ns, very similar to that of
free AP in aqueous solution. However, the flipped out AP is
not entirely free from quenching. The presence of two other
decay components with shorter lifetimes indicates some con-
formational heterogeneity in the flipped-out complex. In
these minor conformations, the AP appears to be subject to
quenching interactions with amino acid residues in the enzyme
pocket or the backbone of the 50-adjacent Gua nucleotide
(Figure 2).
In the crystalline state, the fluorescence decay parameters of
AP unquestionably show a definitive response to base flipping,
as shown graphically in Figure 4a. The key features of this
response are the disappearance of the very short decay com-
ponent (base-stacked AP) and the predominance of a long
lifetime component (unquenched, flipped-out AP). If this is
to be a useful indicator of base flipping, the same distinctive
response must be observable in solution.

Base flipping in solution
The interaction of the M.HhaI enzyme with APout and
APtarget duplexes was investigated in aqueous solution.
Fluorescence decays were recorded for the duplex alone
and when bound to the enzyme and cofactor. The fluorescence
decay parameters of unbound APout, given in Table 3 and
Supplementary Table S3, are consistent with those reported
previously for AP-labelled duplexes (13,38–40). They are
remarkably similar to those of the crystalline APout complex.
This indicates that in solution the DNA duplex exists in essen-
tially the same conformational states, with similar populations,
as those in the crystal. The only significant difference between
the solution and crystalline systems is in the value of the
longest lifetime, reflecting the different extrahelical environ-
ments. The longer value of 11 ns measured for APout in
solution is characteristic of AP free in aqueous solution
(35,36,41,42). Complexation with the enzyme and cofactor
leaves the APout decay parameters essentially unchanged
(Table 3 and Supplementary Table S4), indicating that flipping
of the target cytosine base has negligible effect on the duplex
conformation in the vicinity of the AP probe, away from the
recognition sequence.
For the APtarget duplex in the absence of enzyme interac-
tion, the decay parameters (Table 3 and Supplementary Table
S5) are very similar to those of APout; small differences
suggest subtle variations in the local environment of AP in
the two duplexes. Binding to the enzyme (T250G mutant) and
cofactor causes a pronounced change in the APtarget decay
parameters (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S6), that is
strikingly similar to the response to base flipping observed
in the crystal studies, as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, we
have a definitive signal of base flipping in solution. In the
absence of the cofactor, interaction with the enzyme produces
essentially the same fluorescence response (Table 3 and
Supplementary Table S7), confirming that base flipping also
occurs in the binary M.HhaI–DNA complex, as inferred from
previous fluorescence intensity measurements (19).
Confirming the specificity of the AP response
To determine the specificity of the response of AP to base
flipping, we investigated the fluorescence decay of the
duplexes with AP opposite or adjacent to the target base. In
these duplexes, flipping of the proximate cytosine might be
expected to significantly perturb the immediate environment
of the AP probe, and thus induce a fluorescence response that
could be mistaken for base flipping of the AP itself.
The crystal structures (Figure 3b) show that in both the
APadj and APopp complexes, the AP remains within the
helix when the neighbouring cytosine is flipped out. The fluor-
escence decay parameters of these crystalline complexes
(Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S8 and S9) are clearly
characteristic of intrahelical AP, resembling those of the
APout complex, as illustrated in Figure 5a. The predominant
decay component has a short lifetime, <200 ps, owing to base-
stacked AP, and in only 5% of duplexes is AP in an extra-
helical environment (a similar proportion to the 3% found in
APout). The somewhat longer lifetime of the short decay
component in APadj and APopp, compared with APout,
reflects the absence of AP-guanine base stacking and hence
reduced charge-transfer quenching in these duplexes.
In solution, the decay parameters of the APadj and APopp
duplexes remain essentially unchanged on binding of the
enzyme and cofactor (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables
S10–S13), and they are unambiguously indicative of unflipped
AP, as illustrated in Figure 5b. There is certainly no false-
positive response to base flipping here; neither unstacking on
one face in APadj nor removing the pairing partner in APopp
gives the flipping signal.
DISCUSSION
In both crystalline and solution-phase complexes of M.HhaI
with AP-labelled duplexes, we observe an unambiguous res-
ponse of the AP fluorescence decay to base flipping. The
similarity of the fluorescence decay functions of the duplexes
in the corresponding crystalline and solution-phase systems is
reassuring confirmation that the DNA–enzyme interactions
occurring in solution are faithfully captured in the crystalline
complexes. The time-resolved fluorescence measurements
reveal conformational heterogeneity in the crystals at room
temperature that is not apparent in the X-ray structure. The
fluorescence decay can detect the existence of species that
constitute only a few percent of the excited state population
and is sensitive to transient conformational states that exist on
the timescale of the excited state lifetime. Small changes in
conformational geometry may significantly affect interbase
interactions and hence the fluorescence lifetime. The crystal
structure shows the average or dominant conformational

geometry at 90 K, within the limits of the available structural
resolution.
In solution, the excited state decay of the AP-labelled
duplexes is probably influenced by base dynamics. Barton
and coworkers (43,44) have demonstrated that electron trans-
fer from guanine to AP in DNA is mediated by base motion.
They propose a model in which base motion, during the AP
excited state lifetime, enables the initially excited conforma-
tional population to sample geometries that have greater pro-
pensity for charge-transfer quenching by guanine. Recently,
O’Neill and Barton (45) have reported fluorescence intensity
measurements on AP-labelled DNA duplexes rendered rigid in
a frozen matrix at 77 K. They show a dramatic increase in
fluorescence intensity in the rigid helix, reflecting the loss of
quenching of excited AP when base motion is prevented. For a
duplex with AP immediately adjacent to guanine, the quantum
yield measured relative to free AP in the same matrix, Frel,
increased 20-fold between 298 and 77 K, to a value of 0.45.
It is informative to compare this with the Frel value of 0.06 for
the APout duplex in the crystalline state [where Frel is the ratio
of the number-average lifetime of APout, SAiti, to the lifetime
of AP riboside in aqueous solution (36)]. This suggests that in
the crystal, at room temperature, the duplex is far from rigid
and the base motions that facilitate quenching of AP remain
largely uninhibited.
While the decay parameters of the crystalline and solution
phase systems are generally very similar, there are small
differences that reflect the greater conformational mobility
of the complexes in solution. For the unflipped systems, the
lifetimes of the highly quenched, intrahelical conformations
(t1 and t2) are significantly shorter in solution than in the
crystal. This is consistent with greater dynamic freedom and
consequent enhanced charge-transfer quenching, in line with
Barton’s model. The difference between crystal and solution
systems is most apparent for the base-flipped APtarget com-
plex. In the crystalline complex, the very short decay com-
ponent (t1), characteristic of intrahelical base-stacked AP is
absent, whereas in solution this component is detectable (with
much reduced amplitude) after base flipping. This indicates
that the target AP base continues to sample a base-stacked
conformational state in the solution-phase complex, although
with much reduced probability than in the free duplex. This is
consistent with previous studies of base flipping in M.HhaI–
DNA that have shown evidence of a dynamic equilibrium
between flipped-out and stacked states of the target base
(19,23). The concentrations of protein and DNA used in the
solution studies ensure that all the DNA is bound to M.HhaI.
In the APopp and APadj duplexes, the constancy of the AP
fluorescence decay function, when the neighbouring cytosine
is flipped out, is striking, and demonstrates the specificity with
which M.HhaI flips out the target base and the effectiveness of
the enzyme in supporting the surrounding duplex structure
during base flipping. The hydrogen bonding interactions
between the enzyme and the AP successfully mimic the nor-
mal intrahelical environment of the base. The base-flipping
event appears to have no significant impact on the conforma-
tional structure or dynamics of the duplex, as seen by the AP
probe. The AP remains demonstrably intrahelical and does
not show any increased tendency to occupy an extrahelical
conformation.
The clear response of the AP decay function to base flipping
is not restricted to the M.HhaI enzyme system. In preliminary
studies of other methyltransferases, M.TaqI and M.EcoKI, we
have observed a similar response (A.C. Jones, D.T.F. Dryden
and E. Weinhold, unpublished data), clearly indicative of base
flipping, and we expect that this will apply generally to DNA
methyltransferase and repair enzymes. Thus, the use of AP
time-resolved fluorescence as a probe of base flipping will
enable the scope of investigation of this mechanism to be
greatly expanded.
