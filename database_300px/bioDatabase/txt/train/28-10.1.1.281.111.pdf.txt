ABSTRACT
miRGen is an integrated database of (i) positional
relationships between animal miRNAs and genomic
annotation sets and (ii) animal miRNA targets
according to combinations of widely used target
prediction programs. A major goal of the database is
the study of the relationship between miRNA
genomic organization and miRNA function. This is
made possible by three integrated and user friendly
interfaces. The Genomics interface allows the user
to explore where whole-genome collections of
miRNAs are located with respect to UCSC genome
browser annotation sets such as Known Genes,
Refseq Genes, Genscan predicted genes, CpG
islands and pseudogenes. These miRNAs are con-
nected through the Targets interface to their experi-
mentally supported target genes from TarBase, as
well as computationally predicted target genes from
optimized intersections and unions of several
widely used mammalian target prediction programs.
Finally, the Clusters interface provides predicted
miRNA clusters at any given inter-miRNA distance
and provides specific functional information on the
targets of miRNAs within each cluster. All of these
unique features of miRGen are designed to facilitate
investigations into miRNA genomic organization,
co-transcription and targeting. miRGen can be
freely accessed at http://www.diana.pcbi.upenn.

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, 19–24 nt
long, which play a crucial regulatory role by inhibiting the
translation of protein-coding mRNAs in various eukaryotic
organisms. In 1993, two of these tiny RNAs were fortuitously
identified in a classical forward genetics screen (1). However,
it was not until 2001 that miRNAs were realized to be
widespread and abundant (2–5).
MiRNA biogenesis and function
A miRNAs is processed from a longer transcript, referred
to as the primary transcript (pri-miRNA). miRNAs can be
located within the introns of protein-coding genes, outside
of protein-coding genes entirely (‘intergenic’) or more rarely
in a coding exon, untranslated region (UTR) or exon of a
non-coding transcript. There is evidence that miRNAs located
within the introns of protein-coding genes are processed from
the mRNAs of these ‘host genes’ (6).
The very few pri-miRNAs which have been experimentally
characterized in animals have lengths up to 4 kb (8–10).
Furthermore, these pri-miRNAs often contain several
miRNAs (11). These co-transcribed miRNAs are referred to
as a ‘cluster’. In cases where primary transcripts are
unknown, miRNAs located close to each other on the genome
are thought to be likely members of a ‘cluster’. The maxi-
mum length of a miRNA cluster is still unknown. Statistical
evidence from microarray expression data has suggested that
mammalian pri-miRNAs may be up to 50 kb in length (6).
The distribution of pri-miRNA lengths in different species
is likely to vary, just as protein-coding gene length distri-
bution varies among animal organisms (12–16). After a
pri-miRNA is transcribed, precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA)
hairpin structures are cleaved from the transcript and
exported to the cytoplasm where the final ‘mature’ miRNAs
of 19–24 nt are produced (17,18).
These tiny miRNAs inhibit the translation of a mRNA into
protein through imperfect base pairing to one or more target
sequences in the mRNA. The identification of animal miRNA
targets is a challenging assignment for both experimental
and computational groups. The lack of a canonical high-
throughput experimental method for miRNA target identifica-
tion provides the motivation for the continued development
of computational target prediction programs. Since the first
computational programs in late 2003/early 2004 (19–23),
15 programs have been developed and published (24,25).
Of these, 10 are available for download and/or public
online use (24,25). Very recently the target predictions
from two of these programs have been made accessible as
UCSC Genome Browser tracks. In a recent comparative
study of five widely used mammalian target prediction
programs, TargetScan (20), DIANA-microT (19), miRanda

(26), TargetScanS (27) and PicTar (28), we compared the
output of these programs on the experimentally supported
miRNA target interactions in TarBase (24). We find that no
one program can be considered as consistently superior to
the rest; however, in many cases it may be helpful to use
the intersection of the predictions of a subset of these
programs (29). This can yield improved specificity with
only a marginal decrease in sensitivity relative to any individ-
ual program.
Existing databases and related tools
The discovery of novel miRNAs, the characterization of their
biogenesis and the identification of their functions are areas
of research that have been highly interdisciplinary in nature,
bringing together a number of experimental and computa-
tional groups. There are several existing tools and resources
that provide updated data regarding each of these areas of
research.
Sanger Institute’s miRBase serves as the central database
for experimentally supported mature miRNA sequences (30).
For each supported miRNA, miRBase provides the genomic
coordinates of the predicted precursor sequence, the nucleot-
ide sequences of both the precursor and mature miRNA
sequences and predicted targets of the mature miRNA
according to prediction programs miRanda, PicTar and
TargetScanS. For each individual miRNA, miRBase reports
Ensembl transcripts which contain the miRNA.
Two additional databases, ARGONAUTE (31) and
miRNAMap (32), offer enhanced interfaces to the data
contained in miRBase for human, mouse, rat and dog. miR-
NAMap also reports computationally predicted miRNAs and
their predicted targets according to programs miRanda and
RNAhybrid (33). Finally, it provides cross-links to other
biological databases in order to provide tissue expression
and cross-species sequence conservation data for each sup-
ported and predicted miRNA. ARGONAUTE, published
simultaneously with miRNAMap, provides much of the same
information with perhaps a larger miRNA tissue expression
dataset—collected from various miRNA expression studies.
TarBase offers a manually curated and comprehensive set
of experimentally supported targets in eight different species
(24). It contains over 550 target genes and over 750 individ-
ual target sites. For each miRNA:target interaction that has
gained experimental support, TarBase reports on the suffi-
ciency of the interaction to independently induce translational
silencing, the type of translational silencing that is induced
(repression versus immediate cleavage), the location of the
target site along the 30-UTR, the nature of the base pairing
between the miRNA and target sequence according to the
minimum free energy hybridization and the types of experi-
mental methods used for verification.
MOTIVATION FOR miRGen
The aforementioned resources have been useful as centralized
sources of basic miRNA genomic and target information,
however there are a number of limitations that make it diffi-
cult to conduct systematic analyses of the relationship
between miRNA genomic organization and miRNA function.
For example, one limitation eliminated by miRGen is that it
provides direct queries for miRNAs that are located only in
introns, exons, overlapping exon boundaries or in UTRs for
several popular gene sets including UCSC Known Genes,
Refseq Genes and Genscan Genes. It also provides direct
queries for miRNAs located in other genomic entities such
as pseudogenes and CpG islands. This facility is particularly
useful when studying the targets of miRNAs because it pro-
vides a straight-forward method of determining whether
genomic location or relationship to a particular genomic
entity affects function.
Furthermore, although a few of the existing databases, such
as ARGONAUTE, do provide the option of searching for
predicted miRNA targets from several widely used computa-
tional programs, none of them allow the user to determine
which predictions are shared by one or more of the programs.
Computational programs for target prediction use different
gene id systems (Ensembl gene id, Refseq id, Gene symbol,
etc) to represent the predicted targets genes. miRGen per-
forms gene id integration so that users can search for and
compare target predictions of several programs.
ARGONAUTE and miRNAMap contain miRNA data for up
to four genomes (human, mouse, rat and dog). Except for pre-
dicted target information, miRGen currently provides miRNA
data for 11 animal genomes. Additionally, while surveys with
respect to miRBase miRNAs and Ensembl annotation have
been published for a few genomes in the past (34), a constant
influx of new data makes it very difficult to obtain timely
information from these sources. miRGen is updated quarterly
for all genomes and all of the programs used to generate the
miRGen database are also made available for public use with
user-provided datasets.
Finally, the current state of the art for miRNA databases
still does not afford the user a rapid and undemanding method
of studying the positional relationship among miRNAs. Only
a few poly-cistronic miRNA clusters have been experiment-
ally characterized. Therefore, at the moment, it is necessary
to computationally predict likely miRNA clusters for those
wishing to study the properties and utilities of miRNA co-
transcription. miRGen provides a database of pre-computed
miRNA clusters, at various inter-miRNA distances. It also
affords a user interface for dynamic computation of miRNA
clusters at any user-specified inter-miRNA distance. This
facility is useful for the study of the phylogenetic conserva-
tion of miRNA clusters as well as the study of miRNA cluster
utilities—for example, are clusters generated at various points
in evolution in order to consolidate similarly functioning
miRNAs?
DATABASE STATISTICS
These unique features of miRGen make rapid and up-to-date
customized analyses of miRNA genomic organization and
function accessible to every laboratory, regardless of pre-
vious bioinformatics experience. The following statistics
provide a brief snapshot of miRGen’s capabilities as well as
several insights on the genomic organization and function
of miRNAs.
We first computed the percentages of miRNAs that are
located within the introns of UCSC Genome Browser’s
D150 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue
Known Genes, Refseq Genes and Genscan Genes (Table 1).
Genscan gene predictions are available for nearly all animal
organisms and we note that the average percentage of miR-
NAs located within introns of Genscan genes across all of
the organisms in Table 1 is 42%. miRGen revealed that a
surprising number of mammalian miRNA precursors overlap
exonic and UTR regions of Known Genes. In human, mouse
and rat together there are four cases of precursors contained
in exons, 11 cases overlapping exons and 90 cases inside
UTRs.
For the human genome, we also computed the percentage
of miRNAs that are located in regions that overlap other
UCSC Genome Browser genomic entities. This analysis
reveals that only 10% of human miRNAs are located in
regions that overlap with CpG Islands. Furthermore, corrobo-
rating a recent investigation (35) we report that there may not
be a widespread organizational link between miRNAs and
pseudogenes. Only four of the 466 human miRNAs are con-
tained within a pseudogene from the Yale and Vega Pseudo-
gene sets. Finally, six miRNAs are located within regions
undergoing genomic analysis by the ENCODE Project.
While this number is currently small, these miRNAs are par-
ticularly useful case studies due to the extensive amount of
experimental data (i.e. regulatory elements, gene expression,
etc.) which has been reported for ENCODE regions.
We then investigated which miRNAs are highly likely to
be processed as co-transcribed units in human, mouse, rat
and chicken (Table 2). For each of these organisms, we
note that even at a very conservative maximum inter-
miRNA distance of 1000 nt, over 30% of all miRNAs are
organized into clusters. Furthermore, we analyzed the conser-
vation of cluster composition at this distance. We found that
for 48 of the 50 clusters in mouse, if the cluster contained
more than one miRNA with a like-named ortholog in
human then all of these orthologs were found together in a
human miRNA cluster. This same phenomenon was observed
for 18 out of the 20 clusters in chicken. miRGen provides the
opportunity to perform additional customized analyses by
accessing GO functional annotation for all miRNA targets
of each cluster for any given inter-miRNA distance.
miRGen uniquely provides the predicted target sets of
optimized combinations of the widely used target prediction
programs. In a recent analysis we demonstrate how the use
of different combinations of programs can affect sensitivity
and specificity when evaluated on experimentally supported
target sets (29). We refer the reader to this analysis for a
direct comparison of predicted target sets when using an
individual program, the intersection of the two most recent
programs, the intersection of the 3 second generation pro-
grams and the union of the five most widely used programs.
We make each of these predicted target sets available to the
user through miRGen.
IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN
Data sources
miRGen computes and stores (1) positional relationships
between miRNAs and genomic annotation sets and (2)
miRNA targets according to combinations of widely used
target prediction programs. miRGen builds these primary con-
tents from six underlying types of data: genomic coordinates
for miRNA precursors, UCSC genome annotation files, gen-
ome browser views, experimentally supported miRNA target
data, predicted miRNA target data and Gene Ontology (GO)
data. Genomic coordinates for miRNA precursors are down-
loaded from the Sanger Institute’s miRBase (30) ftp site. All
genome annotation files are downloaded from the UCSC
genome annotation database (36) and all genome browser
views are through the UCSC Genome Browser. miRGen
interfaces whole-genome collections of Sanger miRBase
miRNAs with UCSC genomic data for the following gen-
omes: Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Canis
familiaris, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Gallus
gallus, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Tet-
raodon nigroviridis and Pan troglodytes. Experimentally sup-
ported miRNA targets are accessed from the DIANA
laboratory’s TarBase (24) and predicted miRNA targets are
accessed from results of the PicTar, TargetScanS, miRanda
and DIANA-microT programs (19,26–28). Each experiment-
ally supported or predicted gene is associated with its GO
function as defined by the Gene Ontology Consortium (37).
Regular data updates are facilitated by an automated system

UCSC annotation track files.
Data integration
The proper function of the genomic locations component
requires that miRNA coordinates used for each genome be
compatible with all annotation coordinates. miRGen includes
every eukaryotic organism handled by both miRBase and
UCSC for which genome builds are either identical or can
be rendered compatible via UCSC’s genome LiftOver facil-
ity. The Clusters interface generates cluster links to UCSC
Genome Browser views and to experimentally supported
and computationally predicted miRNA targets. miRGen
links miRNA genomic locations to computationally predicted
targets by querying four prominent and publicly available
programs, PicTar, TargetScanS, Miranda and DIANA-
microT. Currently the predicted targets query facility is
focused on mammalian targets, though it is designed to be
expanded to other species as predictions become available
through the prediction program websites. Experimentally
supported targets are loaded from TarBase, which currently
handles: H.sapiens, M.musculus, D.melanogaster, C.elegans
and D.rerio. A critical data integration task performed by
the underlying targets and cluster facilities is to collate target
gene sets across multiple prediction programs, while these
programs use many different gene identifier systems (Refseq,
Ensembl Gene ID, Ensembl Transcript ID, Gene Symbol).
Database generation
The primary goals of the underlying miRNA locations,
targets and clusters database generation and query programs
are speed and efficiency. The miRNA genomic locations
program performs a binary search into each UCSC genome
annotation file to find items which overlap the precursor
and then the sub-structure of each overlapping item is exam-
ined. The purpose of the binary search is to efficiently extract
these overlapping items from large annotation files. This pro-
gram provides the ability to scan 466 miRNAs over a gene
annotation file of 10 Mb in 7 s on a Pentium IV PC. The
resulting set of miRNA relationships to the sub-structure of
each gene is stored in the database. A similar procedure is
performed for all other annotation sets such as CpG islands.
The Targets interface facilities of miRGen rely on SQL data-
base queries to TarBase, as well as predicted miRNA target
sets. Optimized intersections and unions of the predicted
target sets are stored separately for query by the Targets
interface and for public download as flat files. The Clusters
interface facility initially performs a binary sort of the miRNA
locations by chromosome and strand, then for each gene
set invokes a version of the genomic locations program to
efficiently determine which miRNAs are co-located within
the same gene and which inter-miRNA regions contain
a gene and finally stores this pre-computed information
in the database. When the Clusters interface is invoked by
the user, it then ‘walks’ each chromosome strand using
this pre-stored information to determine which adjacent
miRNAs are added to a cluster given a specific user-defined
inter-miRNA distance. All programs which generate the
miRNA-gene relationship data used by miRGen can be freely
downloaded and expanded under the GNU public license.
USER INTERFACE
miRNA genomics
For each organism, the user can select and sort subgroups of
miRNAs according to their relationship to genes—for exam-
ple, one can select all miRNAs located on the same strand
inside the introns of UCSC Known Genes. The results of
each selection are displayed in a table, where each row con-
tains either an intergenic miRNA or a unique miRNA-gene
relationship pair. If predicted or experimentally supported
targets are available for the selected organism, a miRNA
Targets interface query link is provided for each miRNA.
Within all selected subsets, links to the UCSC genome brow-
ser for each miRNA and gene also allow a graphical view of
any individual entity of interest, shown in Figure 1.
Sorting by miRNA allows the user to easily see which
miRNAs are contained in more than one gene listing—for
example, many splice forms of a particular gene may contain
a single miRNA, but the miRNA may potentially be in a
different intron of each. Sorting by Gene allows the user to
quickly see which genes contain more than one miRNA. If
the ‘Statistics’ box is checked, a summary of gene and
miRNA totals for the selected category is displayed below
the table, along with a breakdown of gene–miRNA relation-
ship pairs contained in each subcategory—the user can exam-
ine the number of gene–miRNA pairs where a miRNA sits
inside a gene 30-UTR for example.
When ‘All UCSC Tracks’ is selected from the ‘Relation-
ship’ menu, a table of all miRNAs for the selected organism
is displayed. In addition to Known, Refseq or Genscan gene
tracks, this table shows which other UCSC track data
entities—Vega Pseudogenes, for example—contain these
miRNAs. A statistics table summarizes the total number
and percentage of miRNAs overlapping each entity. Since
all available annotation sets are included, this summary
table is the best place to gain a quick overview for a particu-
lar genome.
miRNA targets
The miRGen Targets interface is functional for the following
organisms: human, mouse, rat, worm, fruit fly and zebrafish.
For any of these organisms, the user can search either for
targets of a particular miRNA or miRNAs that target a par-
ticular gene. The user also can choose the type of targets to
be reported in the search. For human, the type of targets
can be chosen from the following options: (i) predicted tar-
gets from the union of first and second generation mammalian
target prediction programs (PicTar, TargetScanS, miRanda,
DIANA-microT), (ii) predicted targets from the intersection
of second generation mammalian programs (PicTar, Tar-
getScanS, miRanda), (iii) predicted targets from the optimal
intersection of programs (PicTar, TargetScanS) and
(iv) experimentally supported targets from TarBase (24).
For mouse, rat, worm, and fruit fly, predictions from several
individual programs are available. For zebrafish, only the
TarBase option is currently available. For each target search
type, the user is not limited to a search on one miRNA or
family of miRNAs—any desired group of miRNAs may be
entered so that target information can be analysed collec-
tively. All major target gene ID types (RefSeq, Ensembl
D152 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue
Gene, Entrez Gene, Gene Symbol) along with functional
annotation and GO terms are provided for each predicted tar-
get gene, regardless of the gene’s target prediction program
of origin. Figure 1 provides a snapshot of the miRGen Targets
interface and how it relates to the miRGen Genomics
interface.
miRNA clusters
miRGen allows the user to define a cluster distance—the
maximum distance between any two miRNAs considered to
be in the same cluster—and view the resulting clusters of
miRNAs on each chromosome. miRGen gives careful consid-
eration to the issue of how clusters should be defined in rela-
tionship to protein-coding genes. The Clusters interface
provides a set of advanced options which allow the user to
choose whether all miRNAs within the same gene are auto-
matically defined to constitute a separate cluster, whether a
cluster should be split by a gene which is located between
miRNA members of the cluster and which (if any) available
gene sets for the chosen organism should be used for these
tasks. Non-genic and ‘genic’ clusters are color-coded accord-
ing to the selected gene set. The user can then choose to link
the resulting clusters to a UCSC browser view, to experiment-
ally supported targets provided by TarBase or predicted
miRNA targets provided by PicTar, TargetScanS, Miranda
and DIANA-microT. Selection of appropriate tracks in the
UCSC browser can help the user to produce customized
views which are immediately informative—for example,
selection of the PhastCons conservation track produces a
view such that the user can quickly examine the appearance
of conservation patterns within each cluster. Predicted target
tables for each cluster include a column for comparison of
GO function ontology terms among target genes. Figure 2
provides a snapshot of the miRGen Clusters interface.
CONCLUSIONS
miRGen is designed to study the relationship between
miRNA genomic organization and miRNA function in a
rapidly evolving field with a constant flow of new data.
The number of known miRNAs, as well as the number of
experimentally supported targets for these miRNAs, has
exploded within recent years (Figure 3), while at the same
time target prediction programs are also rapidly changing.
miRGen’s three connected interfaces: miRNA Genomics,
miRNA Clusters and miRNA Targets, provide a user friendly
context for performing rapid up-to-date analyses. miRGen
provides a particular advantage for efficiently examining
large collections of miRNAs using UCSC genome annotation
data where one-by-one look-up is not practical. Clusters can
be analysed en masse at any given inter-miRNA distance,
while at the same time specific functional information on
the targets of individual miRNAs within each cluster is also
accessible. Using the targets facility, any group of miRNAs
may be analysed together as a collection using functional
annotation data. miRGen’s integration of target gene ID sys-
tems enables the user to quickly perform inquiries using
unions or intersections of multiple target prediction programs,
as well as TarBase.

targets.
