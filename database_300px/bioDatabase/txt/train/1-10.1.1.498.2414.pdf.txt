[1] Dry slab avalanches release by a sequence of propagating fractures. In this paper, I
provide field measurements of the important length parameters resulting from fractures for
hundreds fallen slabs including depth, length, and width. The field data show wide
variations in these parameters. Probability plots of all dimensions (length, width, and
depth) suggest they approximately obey log normal probability density functions. Given
slab dimensions, two applications are considered on the basis of the field data. These
applications are: (1) Estimates of total fracture energy consumed around the perimeter of
the slab are given, where it is presumed fracture is mostly mode I, and along the base
(weak layer) of the slab, where shear fracture (mode II and III) is expected. For average
characteristic dimensions, the analysis suggests that energy consumed on the perimeter
is somewhat less than in the weak layer. Even though fracture energy around the perimeter
is expected to be higher than in the weak layer, the larger area fractured in shear at the base
of the slab compared to area fractured in tension around the perimeter results in a
comparable amount of total energy needed around the perimeter. (2) Approximate
estimates of avalanche mass for average characteristic dimensions based on slab depth D
(the only length possibly known prior to avalanching) are made. The mass is considered
related to destructive potential and simple guidelines are given to estimate mass in relation
to D with validation by considering concurrent size and estimates of D by mountain
guides.

1. Introduction
[2] Field observations and measurements show conclu-
sively that propagating shear fractures (mode II and mode
III) within a thin weak layer underneath a thicker, stronger
snow slab are responsible for dry snow slab release
[McClung, 1979, 1981]. Prior to avalanche release of the
fundamental lengths B, L, and D (slab width, length, and
thickness, respectively), the only one that can be estimated
prior to avalanche release is depth to the weak layer, D since
the weak layer can be found from snow profiles and field
tests.
[3] Field measurements show that the ratio of slab width
(B) to length (L) is, on average, approximately B/L  O(1)
[Brown et al., 1972; Jamieson and Johnston, 1990, 1992;
McClung and Schaerer, 2006]. The fractures determining
the ratio B/L are formed entirely on the slab perimeter.
These include tensile fracture at the crown along a distance
and tensile or shear fractures along the sides (or flanks). One
reason to expect that the ratio B/L should be of order 1 is
that the fracture energy for slab material, whether in shear or
tension, is expected to be similar [McClung, 2007a].
[4] Field observations show that the shear fracture prop-
agates upslope from the initiation point underneath a slab of
thickness D for a distance L after which tensile fracture
initiates through the body of the slab at nearly a right angle
to the weak layer [Perla, 1971; McClung, 1979, 1981].
Field measurements and observations show that the ratio of
slab length to thickness L/D 1 but wide variations in the
ratio are observed. I suggest that the value of the ratio (L/D)
is linked to the ratio of slab tensile fracture energy (GI) to
weak layer shear fracture energy (GII). McClung [2007a]
determined that, on average, the ratio is 10 < (GI/GII) < 16
with a range between about 1–300, derived from field
estimates hundreds of dry snow slabs.
[5] A fundamental question in regard to fracture energy is
the relationship between the energy needed to entirely
fracture the weak layer compared to the energy required
to fracture the slab around its perimeter. In this paper,
simple estimates are derived for the ratio of energy con-
sumed around the perimeter to that within the slab base.
Given the avalanche dimensions presented in this paper
combined with a simple model for slab geometry and
suggested values for GI/GII, it is possible to estimate the
ratio of energy to form fractures on the perimeter to the
weak layer. For average or median values of slab dimen-
sions, the ratio is found to be less than one but approaching
or exceeding one for extreme cases.
[6] The field data presented below (Table 1) show that, on
average, the ratio of slab length to thickness is L/D  100

and the ratio of width to length is B/D  1 with wide
variations in both ratios. Given these ratios, it is possible to
estimate avalanche volume for simple models. Since ava-
lanche volume is related to mass and destructive potential, it
is suggested that a knowledge of D prior to avalanche
release can help to estimate expected avalanche mass. In
this paper, avalanche mass is estimated on the basis of
simple modelling and field measurements, as a function of
D. The mass is then related to a five part scale for size on
the basis of destructive potential used in the Canada and the
United States [McClung and Schaerer, 2006, p. 322] and
verification is provided by use of size estimates and
measurements of D provided by mountain guides.
2. Length Dimensions of Dry Snow Slabs From
Field Measurements and Field Estimates
[7] In this section, I report length dimensions from fallen
snow slabs measured in the field and similar data for which
the dimensions are estimated but not precisely measured.
The three important length scales are defined according to
Figure 1. The length D slab is depth, measured or calculat-
ed, through the slab perpendicular to the weak layer. There
is some lack of precision in estimates for D since in the
field, observations show that slab depth varies around the
crown where tensile fracture has taken place. For this paper,
values of D will be taken to be the mean crown thickness.
The parameter D is a fundamental scaling parameter in
relating fracture mechanical size effects [Bazˇant et al.,
2003] for slab initiation.
[8] The parameter L is taken to be the mean distance
between the crown and the lower portion of the slab, called
the stauchwall. Length data for slabs are much more scarce
than crown height or width because the lower boundary
(stauchwall) is often obscured by downslope slab motion in
the initial stages of motion. The parameter B is taken to be
the mean distance between the flanks. As with D, the values
of B and L are normally single representative measurements
rather than mean values taken from multiple estimates.
[9] Field observations show that there is no precise form
for the outline of the fracture pattern from a slab avalanche
taken as a plan view. Perla [1971] suggested on the basis
of a small number of slabs, that the crown is not straight
in the majority of cases but instead, it takes a curved
form. Sometimes the plan view form is nearly elliptical
(Figure 1a) with hardly any visible straight flanks. In this
paper, I will consider two simple forms for the fracture
pattern in plan view: rectangular and elliptical as illustrated
in Figure 1. Figure 2a contains a photo of a slab with
approximately elliptical shape but there are others with nearly
rectangular shape with length greater than width relatively
unconfined with respect to terrain features. Figure 2b shows
avalanches with length greater than width and dimensions
affected by terrain features.

2.1. Slab Length Parameters From Field
Measurements
[10] Figure 3 contains a probability plot for values of D
measured for 191 slab avalanches. The ordinate is a
logarithmic scale so that the plot suggests that values of D
follow a log normal probability density function. The range
of values is from 0.1 to 4.2 m with median 0.66 m and mean
of the log normal distribution is 0.67 ± 0.07 m. The wide
range of values approximates the expected range for most
applications. Figure 3 is for avalanches with a mix of
triggers (natural, explosives, skier triggering) and similar
patterns are found for data sets for one trigger only (skier
triggering, natural). I conclude that the length parameter D
approximately follows a log normal probability density
function regardless of trigger.
[11] Figure 4 contains a probability plot of the ratio L/D
from 63 slab avalanche measurements. Similar to Figure 3,
the plot suggests that the ratio follows a log normal
probability density function. The median value for L/D is
close to 100 with the mean of the log normal distribution
being 103 but the range has nearly 3 orders of magnitude
from approximately 10–1000.
[12] Figure 5 contains a probability plot of the ratio B/D
from field measurements of 130 avalanches. Conclusions
similar to Figure 4 follow: log normal dependence with
nearly 3 orders of magnitude range. The median value is
113 and mean of the log normal distribution is also 113 but

similar to Figure 5, nearly 3 orders of magnitude range for
the ratio are evident.
[13] Figure 7 contains a probability plot of measurements
for B/L from a limited data set where all the avalanches are
unconfined by terrain features. Again, the ordinate is
logarithmic so the plot suggests a log normal probability
density function is followed. However, only 26 data points
are plotted so firm conclusions are not available. The plot
shows that the ratio varies from just over 1 to about 6 with a
median near 2. The plot is congruent with the suggestion by
Brown et al. [1972] that slabs are wider than they are long.
Figure 6 contains a plot of B/L for 63 avalanches similar to
Figure 7. These data are for slabs which may be confined or
unconfined so that some slabs may be influenced by terrain
features. The mean of the log normal distribution is 1.2 for
this data set. The plot shows that slabs may have width as
low as 20% of the length.
[14] There are examples of slabs with length greater than
width when gully walls or other terrain features prevent
lateral extension of fractures as in Figure 2b see also
[McClung and Schaerer, 2006, p. 94]. Thus, terrain features
can have significant effects on slab dimensions. The mean
of the log normal distribution and median sample values
from Figure 7 are both 2.1, which suggests that, on average,
unconfined slabs are about twice as wide as they are long.
[15] From Figures 4 and 5 the mean value of the log
normal distribution of B/D (113) is about that for L/D (100)
for data from the same set. These values suggest that B and
L, on average, are comparable, given a value of D, at least
for this larger set of slabs, which contains mixed confined
and unconfined terrain. Schweizer and Lu¨tschg [2001]
analyzed 69 human triggered avalanches (confined and
unconfined). They found a median value B/L = 0.8 which
confirms that B and L are comparable.
[16] An important factor is that an initial slab can expand
laterally or downslope to engulf other slabs which can
produce widths and lengths which are unreasonably large
for single slabs [McClung and Schaerer, 2006]. Unfortu-
nately, it is not possible to isolate those cases from the data
in this paper but they are important to explain the upper limit
of the distributions of the ratios L/D and B/D in the data
presented, as well as the range of 3 orders of magnitude.
2.2. Dimensions From Fallen Avalanches Estimated
But Not Measured
[17] In this section, I report data from fallen avalanches
for values of D, B, and B/D for fallen avalanches with part
of the data estimated by field observers rather than mea-
sured. The values of D may be regarded as more accurate
than the values of B since the slab depth is often estimated
from known depth to the weak layer whereas B is normally
estimated by simple, visual observations. The observations
have been recorded by the mountain guides of Canadian
Mountain Holidays who are generally skilled field observ-
ers. The data consist of more than 3000 slabs and the results
confirm some of the conclusions of section 2.1.
[18] Figure 8 contains a probability plot of values for D
(2758 slabs) and Figure 9 contains a similar plot for B/D

avalanches. The data are from terrain which is a mix of
unconfined and confined.

avalanches. The data are from terrain which is unconfined.
The data are contained in Figure 6.

probability density function. The data are estimated, not
measured.

(2758 slabs). For Figure 9, the median value from both
sample statistics and the mean value for the log normal
distribution are both 100. Again, both plots suggest that
log normal dependence is a good approximation for the
distributions.
[19] Table 1 contains a summary of the descriptive
statistics for the ratios B/L, B/D, and L/D for all the
measured and estimated lengths from field data. The data
are measured unless otherwise noted. The sample medians
are close to the means of the log normal distributions for the
ratios.
[20] From Table 1, I conclude that the median values both
L/D and B/D are about 100 for a mix of confined and
unconfined avalanches. From measurements, the median
value of B/L is about 1 for a mix of confined and unconfined
avalanches. However, for the small set of unconfined
avalanches, the median value is about 2. The values L/D =
100, B/L = 1 (mix of confined and unconfined avalanches),
and B/L = 2 (unconfined avalanches) are used in the appli-
cations below to estimate fracture energy consumed andmass
related to destructive potential.
3. Simple Geometrical Model Representing Snow
Slab Area
[21] In this section, I consider a simple geometrical model
for the snow slab. Figure 2a, shows a typical snow slab
geometry. In this case, a simple elliptical shape might
approximate the outline of the slab in plan view with a
semiminor axis a = L/2 and semimajor axis b = B/2 and the
ratio being b/a  3. If the case of elliptical geometry
chosen, the flanks would have a theoretical length of zero.
For the other extreme, with rectangular geometry, the flanks
would have length equal to L. Thus, these two extremes are
chosen as the geometrical model below for calculations of
slab area, volume and length on the slab perimeter. Figure 1
shows the simple slab geometry model used in the applica-
tions below. The case shown is for b = 2a or B = 2L as
might be expected for average conditions for unconfined
avalanches.
[22] On the basis of the data in section 2, and the
schematic in Figure 1, the area of the base is given by

In the applications below, equations (1) and (2) are applied
for the following values and limits: L/D = 100, B/L =
2(unconfined), and B/L = 1(confined/unconfined). Field
observations (e.g., Figure 2a) show that D can vary
considerably around the crown, particularly for large
avalanches. Slab taper [Perla, 1977] is an important factor.
Given these observations, only approximate estimates are
available for the applications below.
[23] From equations (1) and (2), on average, the ratio of
basal area to perimeter area is typically between 25 and 35
using L/D = 100 as a median value with D constant all along
the perimeter. This is only a rough estimate since effects
such as slab taper are not accounted for and, due to wide
variations in L/D, variations in the area ratio may be
expected.
4. Approximate Ratio of Fracture Energy
Consumed on the Slab Perimeter to That Along the
Bed Surface
[24] In this section, I consider the ratio between the total
energy needed to produce tensile and shear fracture along
the perimeter of slab avalanches to the total energy needed
to produce shear fracture over the entire area within the
weak layer of slabs. In this section, median values are used
for the dimension ratios and fracture energies of the weak
layer and slab to yield rough values of the ratio of energy
consumed around the slab perimeter to that within the weak
layer. In Appendix A, I consider the energy ratio based on
the ranges of length ratios from the slab measurements and
fracture energies suggested by McClung [2007a]. In this
section, only the median values of fracture energy and slab
dimensions are used to estimate the energy ratio (slab
perimeter vs. slab base) but Appendix A is added to suggest
that wide variations may be expected in the ratio.
[25] Fracture at the base of slabs in the fragile weak layer
is suggested to happen by a combination of mode II (in
plane) and mode III (antiplane) shear fracture [McClung,
1981; Bazˇant et al., 2003; McClung, 2007a]. For the simple
application here, the approximation is made that weak layer
Figure 9. Probability plot of the ratio B/D for 3470 slab
avalanches similar to Figure 5. The data are estimated, not
measured.
F01006 MCCLUNG: DRY SNOW SLAB AVALANCHE DIMENSIONS

F01006
mode II fracture energy is approximately equal to the mode
III fracture energy GII  GIII where the fracture energy is
the energy required to produce a unit area of fracture surface
(J/m2).
[26] Fracture around the perimeter through the slab is
assumed to occur in either tension or shear. Shear fractures
do not readily propagate in homogeneous materials. Instead,
normally a relatively this weak layer is needed. Thus, for
slab material tensile fracture is favored. McClung [2007a]
provided information to suggest that the values of fracture
energy (GI and GII) are approximately equivalent for the
material making up the slab. Thus, I approximate the
fracture energy around the perimeter as GI (mode I) at all
locations even though shear fracture through the slab may
occur at some places around the perimeter.
[27] Using the rectangular geometrical model above, the
ratio of energy needed to the perimeter compared to the
energy needed on the base is

where the median value of L/D = 100 from Table 1 and the
median value of 10 < GI/GII < 16. Since the ratio GI/GII
follows a log normal distribution when calculated from field
data [McClung, 2007a], there is theoretical support for the
form of equation (4) if the ratios (L/D and GI/GII) can be
assumed to be independent. In that case, the log normal
distribution has the property that the median of the product
of log normal distributions (L/D and GI/GII) is given by the
product of the medians of the individual distributions
[Benjamin and Cornell, 1970, p. 269].
[28] Similar calculations for the elliptical model give

I conclude that, given the approximations, the energy
needed for fracture around the perimeter is about 30–60%
of that needed to fracture the weak layer and base. Taking
into account slab taper, suggests that these values may be an
upper limit since slab taper could reduce the area around the
perimeter. The uncertainties by approximating weak layer
fracture as all in mode II and perimeter fracture as all in
mode I produce unknown errors on the results. The
estimates from equation (5) are derived from median values
of the ratios GI/GII [McClung, 2007a] and D/L derived from
field measurements of slab avalanches. Since there are wide
variations in both ratios, wide variations in Eperim/Ebase are
possible (Appendix A). The discussion in Appendix A is
important since the data for the ratios which are used to
estimate Eperim/Ebase come from independent data sets but
physically the ratios may not be independent for individual
avalanches.
[29] Slab displacement downhill following weak layer
shear provides the energy to drive the shear fractures within
the weak layer and at the base. The energy per unit area
provided by downhill slip of magnitude d is given by
rgDsiny(d) where r, g, and y are mean slab density,
magnitude of acceleration due to gravity and slope angle
(Figure 1) respectively. The mean characteristic displace-
ment during strain softening, shear fracture of alpine snow
is d  0.1 mm [McClung, 2007b; D. M. McClung, Dry
snow slab quasi-brittle initiation and verification from field
tests, paper submitted to Journal of Geophyical Research,
2008]. For typical values (r = 200 kg/m3,D = 0.5 m, and y =
35) calculation gives about 0.06 J/m2 which is 3–4 times the
median value of GII estimated for slab avalanches by
McClung [2007a]. Thus, one might expect, on average, that
downhill release of gravitational energy can easily provide
the energy to fracture the weak layer.
[30] Perla [1971] studied the fracture patterns of dry slab
avalanches from a limited data set and he concluded that in
the majority of cases the crown fracture is curved. Field
experience shows that this is true in some cases (Figure 2a).
Figure 10 contains schematics of forces associated with
down slope slab movement which could produce tension
fracture along the curved portions of both the crown and
stauchwall. At the crown (scenario 1 of Figure 10), tension
fracture in at the center of the slab may become curved as it
advances laterally and downslope slab motion is influenced
by friction at the sides. The same pattern of tensile fractures
is observed near the sides of glaciers [Paterson, 1994]
where downslope motion is resisted by friction at the edge
of the glacier.
[31] Field observations suggest that the stauchwall is the
last fracture surface to be formed [McClung and Schaerer,
2006]. Thus, the slab is already in motion when the stauch-
wall is being formed with compressive force resisting the
downslope motion. Resolution of these two forces (scenario
2 of Figure 10), gives a pair of forces in compression and
another in tension which could produce a curved stauch-
wall. For both the crown and the stauchwall, tensile fracture
is expected perpendicular to the resolved maximum princi-
pal tensile stress or highest value of tensile stress. It would
be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate the maximum
principal stress under the dynamic conditions expected.
Thus, Figure 10 may be regarded as one possible explana-
tion of the curved fracture surfaces which are seen in some
avalanches.
5. Estimates of Mass and Destructive Potential
From Slab Measurements as a Function of D
[32] The only slab dimension that can be estimated prior
to avalanche release to an avalanche forecaster or a back
country traveller in avalanche terrain is the depth, D, to the
weak layer. The sections above suggest that, on average, the
mass of avalanches might be estimated for the simple
geometrical model since relations between L, B and D are
provided by field data. The Canadian and American system
[McClung and Schaerer, 2006, p. 322] for sizing avalanches
is based on destructive potential of which one important
component is the estimated mass. In this section, I provide
simple estimates of avalanche mass as a function of D. This
enables guidelines for values of D for mass estimates in the
size systems based on destructive potential. I will use the
F01006 MCCLUNG: DRY SNOW SLAB AVALANCHE DIMENSIONS

parameters in section 4 above and the geometrical model of
section 3 and Figure 1 to provide simple estimates.
[33] In order to estimate the mass M as a function of D, a
simple relationship between mean slab density and depth is
needed. For the data in Figure 3 (191 avalanches), a
nonlinear least squares regression was performed to yield
a relationship between mean slab density r, and depth
r ¼ 225D0:24 kg=m3: ð6Þ
In equation (6), the t statistics for both of the constants are
highly significant with a values <0.001 but there is
considerable scatter (R2 = 0.18 where R is the Pearson
correlation coefficient). For the data set, the median value of
D is 0.57 m with a range 0.1–4.2 m.
[34] For the rectangular model, the mass is given by M =
rBLD. The expressions for mass in tonnes are then given by
(with L/D = 100)
M ¼ 2250D3:24 ! B ¼ Lð Þ

Solving for D gives a relation of the form
D ¼ M
225C0
 0:31
m; ð9Þ
where C0 is a constant depending the geometrical model.
For the rectangular model, C0 = 10(!B = L) and 20(!B =
2L) and for the elliptical model, C0 = 2.5p(!B = L) and
5p(!B = 2L). Table 2 contains the order of magnitude size
classification system used in Canada and USA [McClung
and Schaerer, 2006] along with the depth guidelines from
equation (9) based the limits with the different values of C0.
[35] The size guidelines (D) for sizes 4 and 5 are given by
a footnote because the estimates do not include entrainment
of material which is a known feature [Sovilla, 2004; Sovilla
et al., 2006] of large avalanches. It can be expected in such
cases that the total mass may be higher by almost a factor
approaching 10 than the initial slab mass. Thus, for sizes 4
and 5, the depth guidelines could be overestimates even
though the guidelines are for average rather than extreme
cases. This may also be true for size 3 in some cases.
[36] From equation (9), an order of magnitude increase in
mass yields a two fold increase in D (i.e., 100.31 = 2.04).
The depth estimates for the different sizes provide important
guidelines for avalanche forecasters and back country
travellers if it is remembered that they are typical values
for average size (mass) and wide variations are expected.
McClung and Schaerer [2006] suggest that a definition of
acceptable risk in back country travel is that it is unaccept-
able to trigger a size 2 avalanche. The guideline in Table 2
suggests that typical slab depths could be expected in the
range 30–40 cm for size 2, which may aid in decisions.
McClung and Schaerer [2006] suggested 30 cm of new
snow as an important threshold for a danger signal for
backcountry travel.
[37] The slab depth estimates in Table 2 are theoretical
estimates based upon median avalanche lengths estimated
from field measurements and simple geometrical modelling.
The mountain guides of Canadian Mountain Holidays have

fracture at the crown (scenario 1) and stauchwall (scenario 2). At the crown (scenario 1), downhill slab
force combined with side friction force may produce tensile fracture perpendicular to the resolved tensile
force. At the stauchwall (scenario 2), bottom compressive resistance and downhill slab thrust force could
combine to produce a curved tension fracture similar to the crown.

estimated both slab depth D and avalanche size according to
the Canadian avalanche size system in the first 4 columns of
Table 2. In Table 3, I summarize the estimated avalanche
size (median of D) and the theoretical values from Table 2.
Mountain guides in Canada use half sizes for which there is
no definition in the size system. For Table 3, half sizes were
rounded up to the next size class, for example, size 2.5 was
counted as size 3 in order to fit the data into the size classes
of the size system.
[38] From Table 3, the depth guidelines are close to, but
somewhat below, the medians of depths estimated by
guides. Typically, the median values from the guides
estimates are within 20 centimeters of the upper limits of
the guidelines. This comparison suggests that, from the
perspective of making decisions, the depth guidelines are
slightly conservative which is desirable for applications. It
must be remarked that guides use the other columns of
Table 2 including the text description, as well as mass
guidelines, for estimating size or destructive potential. If
only those avalanches estimated to be in even size numbers
(1, 2, 3, and 4) are used, then the median depths and No. of
avalanches are changed respectively to: size 1 (0.35 m,
312), size 2 (0.60 m, 739), size 3 (1.2 m, 357), size 4 (2.0 m,
34). The estimates are virtually identical for sizes 1, 2, and 3
with a slight difference for size 4.
6. Limitations and Approximations
[39] Many approximations are used to arrive at the
approximate results in the applications in this paper. They
are as follows:
[40] 1. The slab height D is taken as the mean value all
along the perimeter of the slab from a single measurement
taken at the crown. Field observations show that slab
thickness can vary not only all along the crown but all
along the slab perimeter as well. Slab taper, noted by Perla
[1977], can occur along the crown as well as on the flanks.
In addition, very few examples exist whereby people have
taken enough measurements to accurately determine mean
or median crown height. The values used in this paper are
approximate estimates of mean crown thickness represented
by single measurements.
[41] 2. For most of the examples, there is no information
on how slab width, B, might be affected by terrain features
or forest cover. Furthermore, most estimates of B are single
measurements which are taken to represent the mean width.
There are no data to accurately estimate the mean or median
width for any of the cases. The same comments apply to the
values of L. The values of L are supposed to represent mean
values but, like B and D, they represent single measure-
ments measured at a position which is approximately the
mean value by inspection.
[42] 3. The two simple geometrical models used (rectan-
gular and elliptical) represent extremes for maximum value
of flank length: equal to L (rectangular) and minimum flank
length: equal to zero (elliptical). The twomedian ratios of B/L
(1 and 2) used in the applications are determined from limited
data sets of 63 and 26 avalanches respectively. The ratios may
be subject to revision when larger data sets become available.
[43] 4. Data for the values of L are limited because, in
most cases, the stauchwall is covered or destroyed after the
slab breaks free and moves down the slope. In this paper,
only 63 values of L are used. The median of the ratio L/D =
100 is used with both limits (B/L = 1 or 2) to estimate area
or volume. Thus, for example, if B/L = 1 then the basal area
is half that for B/L = 2 using the rectangular model. There is
not enough information about slab geometry with the data
set to show how realistic such approximations are.
[44] 5. In order to estimate the energy consumed for
fracture through and around the perimeter of the slab, the
value of mode I fracture energy GI was used on the crown,
stauchwall and flanks. Sometimes the flanks are straight
(see the rectangular model of Figure 1b) which suggests that
flank fracture may have been in shear (mode II). I suggested
[McClung, 2007a] from simple shear experiments that the
slab fracture energy for mode II for homogeneous snow is
comparable to mode I and this has been suggested by
experimental results that shear and tensile fracture tough-
ness are comparable for homogeneous samples [Schweizer
et al., 2004]. Normally, mode II fracture is not expected in

homogeneous materials. Instead, a layered structure is
needed such as the weak layer fracture for dry snow slab
avalanches. Figure 10 contains the suggestion that the
curved fractures sometimes observed on the crown and
stauchwall may consist of mode I fracture. Another similar
approximation used in section 4 is that mode III fracture
energy is comparable to mode II fracture energy for ava-
lanche weak layers. I expect these values should be com-
parable but there are no measurements or theoretical
estimates of weak layer mode III fracture energy to confirm
this. In addition, it is not known what fraction of weak layer
fracture is mode II or mode III.
[45] 6. The applications in this paper are derived from
empirical relations based on field data. Equations (4) and (5)
should be taken to provide empirical rather than theoretical
results. It has to be emphasized that the product of ratios
(GI/GII)(D/L) is derived from different databases. The con-
clusions from equations (4) and (5), should not be extrap-
olated beyond those derived from the product of the
medians of these ratios.
7. Summary and Conclusions
[46] The following conclusions result from field measure-
ments, field observations, and simple theoretical consider-
ations subject to the limitations listed in section 6:
[47] 1. On average, the ratio of slab length to thickness is
L/D; 100, the ratio of slab width to thickness is B/D; 100
and the median ratio of width to length is B/L  1.2 for
confined and unconfined avalanches with many cases
having B/L < 1. For unconfined avalanches, Brown et al.
[1972] predicted that the ratio B/L should be greater than
one in all cases. This suggestion fits with the median of the
data for unconfined avalanches in this paper for which the
median value of B/L for is 2.1.
[48] 2. The field data show that all the key length scales
(B, L, and D) are approximately log normally distributed as
well as the ratios and products of these. The log normal
distribution has a multiplicative property [Benjamin and
Cornell, 1970] so it is expected that ratios and products
should be log normal. Some of the probability plots of the
ratios show a lack of fit at the lower or upper bounds of the
data. The log normal character is only a rough approxima-
tion. Goodness of fit tests may indicate other distributions as
candidates for use with the data, particularly if the shape of
the distribution is important in applications. All plots
involving D show wide variations in the ratios and all
length scales exhibit ranges of nearly 3 orders of magnitude.
[49] 3. The curved crown tensile fracture line (modelled
as elliptical here) is probably due to shear friction resistance
on the flanks combined with the downhill force of the slab
caused by gravitational energy release as shear fractures
propagate up and across slope (Figure 10).
[50] 4. The curved bottom (stauchwall) fracture line
which is seen in some cases is probably due mostly to tension
fracture as a result of downhill slabmotion thrust (after crown
tensile fracture), combined with compressive support at the
lower boundary of the slab as viewed in plan (Figure 10). The
explanation here, as well as that for point 3 above, may be
regarded as one possible explanation of curved surfaces but
there is no conclusive proof offered here.
[51] 5. For the data and approximations in this paper, on
average, the energy consumed by tensile fracture around the
slab perimeter is somewhat less than the shear fracture
energy consumed in the weak layer at the base of the slab.
Wide variations in slab dimensions and fracture energies
prevent a general statement of this suggestion. Appendix A
contains a simple analysis employing some of the variations
and I suggest that no general statement is possible. Limita-
tion 6 above also addresses this point.
[52] 6. Available slab gravitational energy released by
downhill slab motion should exceed energy consumed in
creation of basal (weak layer) fracture surface by a consid-
erable margin.
[53] 7. For constant D, the slab dimension data suggest
that, on average, the basal area fractured in shear is more
than 25 times the area fractured around the perimeter in
tension or shear. If slab taper is taken into account, this
value will increase since measurements of D are from the
crown where slab thickness is normally maximum.
[54] 8. On the basis of comparison of median slab depths
estimated by guides, the depth guidelines calculated from
avalanche data seem reasonable for the size categories in the
Canadian avalanche size system. The maximum depth from
the depth guidelines is within 20 centimeters of the median
of depths estimated by guides in each size class (Table 3).

where C is a constant with value between 3 and 4. From
McClung [2007a], the ratio GI/GII takes values between
approximately 1 and 300 with a median about 10. The
avalanche data (Figure 3) suggest that the ratio L/D varies
between about 30 and 800 with a median value about 100.
Given that the ratio GI/GII follows a log normal distribution
[McClung, 2007a] when calculated from avalanche data and
that the ratio L/D follows a log normal distribution, it is
reasonable to expect the product will follow a log normal
distribution. The product of the medians (the mean of the
log normal distributions) then gives 0.1 or a rough estimate
of the energy ratio, on average, as 0.3–0.4 as suggested in
section 4. Pairing the extremes of the data is equivalent to
the assumption that there is no correlation between the
fracture energy and length ratios. Repeating the calculations
by pairing the highest value of GI/GII (300) with the lowest
value of L/D (30) and vice versa gives a range for the
energy ratio in equation (A1) of 0.004–30. Given that the
distribution of the product should be log normal, most of the
data would be expected to fall in the range for the energy
ratio between 0.01 and 10 (3 orders of magnitude) with
center of the distribution falling somewhere between 0.1
and 1.
[56] Field observations suggest that the two ratios (GI/GII
and L/D) are not always independent. Stiff, tough, thick
slabs tend to allow shear fracture propagation over long

distances before tensile fracture through the crown results in
avalanche release [McClung and Schaerer, 2006, p. 93]. As
the shear fracture propagates, tensile stresses are built in the
slab. The simplest model is to assume that the avalanche
release is imminent once the tensile fracture toughness is
reached in a small region at the base of the slab just above
the weak layer after propagating a distance L. Higher slab
density at the base, associated with thick slabs, gives higher
tensile fracture toughness requiring longer propagation dis-
tances to accumulate higher tensile stresses in order to reach
the tensile fracture toughness. The process is explained by
McClung and Schweizer [2006].
[57] The prominent feature of dynamic mode II propaga-
tion in the weak layer is the stress drop, q, behind the
fracture process zone following propagation [Freund,
1990]. As the shear fracture propagates over a distance L,
a simple one-dimensional model suggests tensile stresses
build approximately as q(L/D) [Palmer and Rice, 1973;
McClung, 1981] until tensile fracture toughness is reached
in a small boundary layer at the bottom of the slab [McClung
and Schweizer, 2006]. The concepts suggest that higher
tensile fracture energy (or higher tensile fracture toughness)
in the slab should be associated with longer propagation
distance. The propagation distances from fallen avalanches,
L/D > 30, are much larger than the ratio of L/D needed for
shear fracture initiation which is about 1 either for the size
effect law of Bazˇant et al. [2003] or the verification by
hundreds of field tests [Gauthier, 2007]. Thus, I suggest that
the length ratio L/D enters the problem from the tensile
stress (or stress concentration factor) accumulated at the
bottom of the slab as the shear fracture propagates. This
physical interpretation suggests that larger values of L/D
should be paired with higher values of the ratio GI/GII in
equation (A1) and vice versa. Applying these pairings
gives the limits for Eperim/Ebase between (0.5–0.375)C or a
range of values for the energy ratio as Eperim/Ebase between
0.15 and 1.5, with a typical value of about 0.5 as suggested
in section 4.
[58] There are many effects not accounted for in the
physical model here including slab stratigraphy and dynam-
ic effects on the shear fracture propagation. Given uncer-
tainties in the parameters, the safest conclusion is reached
by using only the average values (medians of the distribu-
tions) as in section 4. The physical picture here suggests that
energy consumed on the perimeter might exceed that at the
base in extreme cases but, even then, the magnitude of the
ratio is of order 1. As suggested above, the opposite
assumption, (that there is no correlation between GI/GII
and L/D), gives a much larger range for the energy ratio but
the average value for the energy ratio is still expected to be
somewhat less than one which is the only claim made in this
paper.
[59] The wildly varying properties of avalanche dimen-
sions, combined with field observations, favor the first
interpretation of little or no correlation between the ratios
GI/GII and L/D. Spearman rank correlation of L with D for
the limited data available shows positive correlation but it is
not significant statistically. The weak correlation of mean
slab density with slab depth in equation (6) also indicates
high scatter in the avalanche data. At present, there is no
database for which both ratios (GI/GII and L/D) are esti-
mated to aid in firmer conclusions.
