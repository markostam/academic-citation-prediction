ABSTRACT
HubMed is an alternative search interface to the
PubMed database of biomedical literature, incorpor-
ating external web services and providing functions
to improve the efficiency of literature search, brow-
sing and retrieval. Users can create and visualize
clusters of related articles, export citation data in
multiple formats, receive daily updates of publica-
tions in their areas of interest, navigate links to
full text and other related resources, retrieve data
from formatted bibliography lists, navigate citation
links and store annotated metadata for articles of
interest. HubMed is freely available at http://www.
hubmed.org/.
BACKGROUND
NCBI’s PubMed (http://www.pubmed.gov/), a biomedical
literature database incorporating MEDLINE, is the primary
source of peer-reviewed biomedical information for scientific
researchers, practising health professionals and the general
public. Rapid response times from the search engine Entrez
and integration with other NCBI-hosted databases such as
GenBank allow PubMed to provide broad, up-to-date and
curated search results. However, this breadth of coverage
and functionality for a wide variety of users, ranging from
those researching the results of clinical trials to those
examining the composition of DNA sequences, means that
Entrez/PubMed is unable to optimize its interface and
functions for researchers that need to search and browse
large volumes of literature covering their specific area of
interest. The PubMed interface also lacks integration with
web-based resources outside the NCBI.
Availability of the PubMed database via a web services API
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/eutils_help.
html), launched in 2002, opened up the possibility for external
developers to take advantage of the NCBI’s databases and
processing power to provide alternative representations of
the biomedical literature; e.g. analysing and extracting
meaning from abstracts and MESH headings (1) or providing
interfaces that add specialized functions (2).
FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY HUBMED
HubMed (http://www.hubmed.org) is one such tool based
around the Entrez Programming Utilities web service API.
HubMed provides a dynamic and intuitive interface that trans-
forms data from PubMed and integrates it with data from other
sources, with the aim of improving the ability of researchers to
find and manage biomedical literature related to their research.
For the last three years, HubMed has been providing daily
updates of new arrivals to the MEDLINE database in a variety
of XML (Extensible Markup Language) feed formats
[currently Atom (http://atompub.org/), RSS 1.0 (RDF) and
RSS 2.0 (http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss)]. Subscribing
to a feed of new matches for any search query is free
and requires no registration, enabling tools such as Onfolio
(http://www.onfolio.com/) and Kebberfegg (http://www.
researchbuzz.org/tools/kebberfegg.pl) to dynamically gener-
ate feed subscriptions on demand, that can then be processed
by desktop or web-based feed aggregators (see http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregator for more details). Each item
in a feed is linked via a unique identifier—the PubMed ID
(PMID)—to HubMed’s display of the most useful metadata
available for that article, from where users can carry out a
variety of functions, some of which are described below.
As most publications are not generally made available to
researchers in a metadata-rich interchange format, the full text
PDF of an article remains the most fundamental part of a
researcher’s digital library: an important link out of HubMed
is therefore to the full online text of a paper. Users can proceed
to the full text of an article using any of four overlapping
options: through PubMed’s ELink service (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/elink_help.html) that leads to
the document on the publisher’s website; via Ex Libris’
demonstration SFX server (http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/
sfx/htm). that provides a range of alternate full text services
(often based on either the PMID or Digital Object Identifier
(DOI, http://www/doi.org/) of an article); through Google
Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/), that carries out a full
text search of selected web documents; or via activation of

embedded COinS metadata (http://ocoins.info/) which allows
anyone with a COinS-activating web browser extension
(available from http://ocoins.info/#id3205609425) or proxy
server to receive links to a full text resolver (based on the
OpenURL linking standard, http://www.niso.org/standards/
standard_detail.cfm?std_id¼783) appropriate for their
location or institutional affiliation.
While searching, browsing and reading articles, researchers
are able to use HubMed to build a store of metadata for the
papers that they find the most useful or interesting, as well as
generating a taxonomy for these collections, by affixing tags
(a synonym for keywords or labels) and annotations to each
article. The Tag Storage service (http://www.hubmed.org/
tags), which requires a free registration, facilitates the recall
and browsing of articles collected by each user or user group.
HubMed also works fluently with other academic- and
science-targeted social bookmarking tools such as CiteULike
(http://www.citeulike.org/) and Connotea (http://www.
connotea.org/), both of which are able to automatically
retrieve metadata for items stored using a PMID.
Once articles are stored inside HubMed’s Tag Storage, users
can arrange them into lists, view weighted visualizations of
their tag usage frequency and export their stored data as RDF
(http://www.w3.org/RDF/), for use with other tools. This
RDF/XML export feature is also available from any HubMed
search result page, providing a basis for the use of information
harvesting and management tools, such as SIMILE’s Piggy
Bank (http://simile.mit.edu/piggy-bank/), an extension for the
Firefox web browser that can be used to store, manipulate,
browse and visualize data collected from any RDF data-
exporting source. The possibilities enabled by this kind of
semantic data store are numerous, such as inferring conflicts
or agreements between networks of biomedical research
publications (e.g. http://potlach.org/feast/2005/08/03/
on-connecting-things/).
As illustrated in Figure 1, HubMed also provides direct
export of article metadata in a range of other formats, including
RIS (http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp, for
use with Endnote, RefDB and many other bibliographic tools),
BibTeX (http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~jacobsd/bib/formats/
bibtex.html, for use in TeX documents), MODS (http://
www.loc.gov/standards/mods/, for use with XML document
formats) and a direct link to send citation data to the online
bibliographic library manager RefWorks (http://www.
refworks.com/). HubMed maintains Unicode (UTF-8) charac-
ters throughout all its processes, so can provide the option to
either include these accented characters in exported citation
data or convert them to their Latin equivalents for use with
older, Unicode-incompatible tools.
To aid researchers wishing to browse the bibliography lists
of papers published online in PDF format, HubMed can extract
bibliographic data from text copied and pasted from PDF
documents. The Citation Finder, available at http://www.
hubmed.org/citation.htm, extracts each reference, parses the
citation string and converts it into a PubMed search; the results
are then displayed in HubMed as standard search results,
allowing users to continue to read and work with the refer-
enced articles. This citation parsing algorithm is based on a
modified version of the ParaTools Perl modules (http://
paracite.eprints.org/developers/) produced by the Open
Citation Project (http://opcit.eprints.org/).
To help users better understand jargon, acronyms and
specialized scientific terms found within articles, HubMed’s
‘Terms’ function, which accompanies each abstract, passes the
abstract text through two web service filters in order to identify
important keywords. The first, Whatizit (http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/Rebholz-srv/whatizit/), is provided by the EBI and identi-
fies Gene Ontology terms, along with protein and drug names
in the text, adding links from each term to the Gene Ontology
(3), UniProt (4) and MedlinePlus (http://medlineplus.gov/),
respectively. The second filter compares all words to a
database of Wikipedia page titles (available from http://
download.wikipedia.org/) and adds links to the appropriate
Wikipedia pages (http://www.wikipedia.org/) from words
for which information is available. HubMed also aids search
result browsing by extracting and displaying sentences from
Figure 1. A HubMed page displaying the abstract for a single article along with action links and options for a variety of export formats.

the abstract text in which the query terms occur. Additionally,
searches are augmented both by the use of PubMed’s ESpell
web service (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/
espell_help.html), which provides alternative spelling
suggestions for queries which return few or no results, and
by a display of the MeSH categories (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/
mesh/meshhome.html) matched by each query, which can be
deselected or augmented as desired to refine the search query.
There are a number of tools in HubMed for exploring
connections between related papers. Citation links can be
explored directly for papers that are deposited in PubMed
Central (data available from http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/
utils/, including those from Open Access publisher BioMed
Central), and there are also links to Elsevier’s subscription
service Scopus (http://www.scopus.com/), which allows in-
depth exploration of citation and co-citation data. Articles
related by co-occurrence of keywords can be explored directly
as with normal search results using the relatedness score cal-
culated by PubMed (described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/entrez/query/static/computation.html); these connections
can be visualized as a dynamic force-directed graph using a
TouchGraph Java applet (used with permission from http://
www.touchgraph.com/). Articles can also be ranked by order
of relatedness to multiple articles using HubMed’s ‘Rank
Relations’ feature, which allows an iterative refinement of
clustered articles providing a more focused view of a topic
than standard keyword searches. This is similar to a previously
published process used for automatically updating biblio-
graphies using ranking of related articles (5). In conjunction
with browsing articles related by keywords and citation links,
it would be useful to be able to browse the network of col-
laborations between authors of scientific papers (6), but this is
currently precluded by a lack of unique author identifiers in the
MEDLINE database, making it difficult to disambiguate
multiple researchers who share the same name.
CONCLUSIONS
For future development, HubMed will continue to incorporate
the functions of external web services as they become
available (so far, all the mentioned web services have used
simple Representational State Transfer (REST)-based inter-
faces), as well as augmenting built-in functions that improve
search efficiency and user-friendliness. Personalization of
searches and recommendations, based on patterns of user
attention and implied interests, may also improve the accuracy
of search results. The role of HubMed in providing building
blocks for semantic life sciences data management will
continue to adapt to new developments and the needs of
researchers in this area.
