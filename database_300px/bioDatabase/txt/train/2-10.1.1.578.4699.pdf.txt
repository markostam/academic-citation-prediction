ABSTRACT
Trinucleotide repeats are involved in a number of
debilitating diseases such as myotonic dystrophy.
Twelve to seventy-five base-long (CTG)n oligodeoxy-
nucleotides were analysed using a combination
of biophysical [UV-absorbance, circular dichroism
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)] and
biochemical methods (non-denaturing gel electro-
phoresis and enzymatic footprinting). All oligomers
formed stable intramolecular structures under near
physiological conditions with a melting temperature
that was only weakly dependent on oligomer length.
Thermodynamic analysis of the denaturation process
by UV-melting and calorimetric experiments revealed
an unprecedented length-dependent discrepancy
between the enthalpy values deduced from model-
dependent (UV-melting) and model-independent
(calorimetry) experiments. Evidence for non-zero
molar heat capacity changes was also derived from
the analysis of the Arrhenius plots and DSC profiles.
Such behaviour is analysed in the framework of an
intramolecular ‘branched-hairpin’ model, in which
long CTG oligomers do not fold into a simple long
hairpin–stem intramolecular structure, but allow the
formation of several independent folding units of
unequal stability. We demonstrate that, for sequences
ranging from 12 to 25 CTG repeats, an intramolecular
structure with two loops is formed which we will call
‘bis-hairpin’. Similar results were also found for CAG
oligomers, suggesting that this observation may be
extended to various trinucleotide repeats-containing
sequences.
INTRODUCTION
Recent molecular genetic studies have revealed a correlation
between spontaneous expansion of several DNA trinucleotide
repeats and a variety of debilitating human diseases [for
reviews see (1–4)]. This class of diseases was first character-
ized in Fragile-X syndrome (5) and later in myotonic dys-
trophy and other disorders. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)
is caused by the expansion of a (CTG)–(CAG) repeat in the
DMPK gene (6). To date, at least nine distinct loci show
instability with the same (CAG)–(CTG) repeat. These diseases
increase in severity with earlier onset in successive genera-
tions and have no cure. Although the pathological states show
different characteristics, one common feature among them is
that the affected repetitive DNA unit has expanded beyond the
number of repeats found in the healthy population. Therefore,
the expansion of triplet repeats represents a novel mutational
mechanism. More recently, other disorders have been associ-
ated with the expansion of non-trinucleotide motifs, such as
the CCTG tetranucleotide in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (7).
DNA secondary structures may be considered as a common
and causative factor for triplet expansion (8–10) but the
molecular mechanisms causing the instability are unknown
and remain a subject of intensive study. Even if no therapeutic
approach is currently available to prevent or revert repeat
expansion, in vitro studies suggest that repeat deletion could
be induced by various chemotherapeutic agents (11,12); thus,
opening a new field of study aimed at the design of trinuc-
leotide repeat-specific ligands. Preliminary results suggest that
selective recognition of trinucleotide repeat structures is
possible (S. Amrane, unpublished data), but the rational design
of such ligands should be facilitated by knowledge of the
structure and energetics of their nucleic acid target.
Repetitive CNG sequences are susceptible to the formation
of duplexes by self-folding, forming two Watson–Crick G–C
pairs and one mismatch pair (13–16). Long hairpins have long

lifetimes and inhibit duplex reannealing (17,18). A contro-
versy remains on how different are these structures from clas-
sical B-DNA. Besides forming ‘slipped duplexes’ (19), CGG
repeats have been reported to form quadruplexes (20–23).
However, a recent study demonstrated that CGG repeats are
reluctant to form tetraplexes under physiological conditions
and this structure is unlikely to be involved in the disease (24):
these sequences preferentially fold into antiparallel homo-
duplexes or hairpins in a length-dependent manner.
Concerning the structure of the bimolecular (CTG–CAG)n
duplex, several results revealed a ‘polyhairpin concept’. Stud-
ies on (CAG–CTG)30,50 showed that these duplexes formed
alternative DNA duplex structures named SDNA and SiDNA
(9,19,25–27). This conclusion was reached using atomic force
microscopy, electron microscopy, native gel electrophoresis,
Mung Bean (MB) and T7 endonuclease cleavage assays.
SDNA is a well-described bimolecular polyhairpin structure
composed of multiple short (CTG)n and (CAG)n (n ¼ 1–10)
slipped-out structures with a hairpin-like single-stranded char-
acter. SDNA is formed in the absence of replication when the
two complementary strands have the same length. Instead,
SiDNA is formed during replication between two comple-
mentary strands with a different number of repetitions and
results in repeat expansion or deletion. SiDNA is composed
of one major slipped-out structure containing 20–30 repeats of
the longest (CTG)n or (CAG)n strand.
To date, only the short hairpin structures (containing <10
repeats) involved in the formation of SDNA have been clearly
established (15,28) revealing an intramolecular stem with
several repetitions of a T·T or A·A mismatch sandwiched
between 2 G–C base pairs. In contrast, the nature of the struc-
tures observed for longer repeats involved in the formation of
SiDNA is still unclear. Even if several studies have previously
demonstrated that long trinucleotide repeats adopt more com-
pact structures than the short ones, suggesting the hypothesis
of a multi-folded structure (16,29), but little is known about
their exact conformation. The elucidation of this point is the
purpose of our study; i.e. the analysis of the conformational
properties of individual (CTG)n or (CAG)n strands, which
may constitute the single slipped-out structures of particular
DNA regions.
Initial thermodynamic studies showed the stabilities of
CAG and CTG hairpins to be nearly identical under physio-
logical salt concentrations in vitro (17). In contrast, Vo¨lker
et al. (30) showed that, within a conformationally confined
system, (CAG)6 and (CTG)6 form stable, ordered structures
with the former triplet less stable than the latter, as also
recently confirmed by another group (31). In this study, we
analysed the folding of (CTG)n and (CAG)n individual
sequences by using biophysical [UV-absorbance, circular
dichroism (CD) and microcalorimetry] and biochemical tech-
niques (native gel electrophoresis and enzymatic footprinting).
In agreement with the previous results, we found that the
folding of these sequences is intramolecular rather than
bimolecular and that these structures are stable in phy-
siological conditions. The study of the thermodynamic data
obtained by thermal denaturation and microcalorimetry led us
to propose an intramolecular ‘bis-hairpin’ like model for
(CTG)n and (CAG)n individual strands (n ¼ 12–25), with
longer strands possibly giving rise to the formation of multi-
branched hairpins. These structures are actually distinct from
the multiple hairpins found in SDNA and SiDNA, in which
several short hairpins protrude from a DNA duplex at different
positions. Our model suggests that each slipped-out single-
stranded region found in SDNA and SiDNA can actually fold
into structures more complex than previously thought, as soon
as 10–12 repeats are present in a single protruding loop.
Similar results were also found for (CAG)n repeats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oligodeoxynucleotides
Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were synthesized by Eurogentec
(Belgium) on the 0.2 or 1 mmol scale. As all oligomers studied
here correspond to DNA, the ‘d-’ prefix was omitted from
most sequences. Purity was checked by gel electrophoresis.
All concentrations were expressed in strand molarity using a
nearest-neighbour approximation for the absorption coeffi-
cients of the unfolded species (32).
Thermal difference spectra for CTG and CAG
trinucleotide repeats
The thermal difference spectrum (TDS) of a nucleic acid is
obtained by simply recording the UV-absorbance spectra of
the unfolded and the folded states at temperatures, respect-
ively, above and below its melting temperature (Tm). The
difference between these two spectra is defined as the TDS.
The TDS has a specific shape that is unique for most structures
(33,34) (J.L. Mergny et al., manuscript in preparation); thus,
providing a simple, inexpensive and rapid method to gain
structural insight into nucleic acid structures, both DNA
and RNA, ranging from short oligomers to polynucleotides.
Spectra were recorded between 220 and 335 nm with a
Kontron Uvikon 940 UV/Vis spectrophotometer using quartz
cuvettes with an optical pathlength of 0.2 or 1 cm. The dif-
ferential spectrum of a CTG repeat structure gives a maximum
differential absorbance at an unusually high wavelength
(277 nm) (34).
UV-melting experiments
The thermal stability of the different trinucleotide repeat struc-
tures was estimated by heating/cooling experiments, recording
the UV-absorbance at several wavelengths as a function of
temperature using a Kontron Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer
thermostated with an external ThermoNeslab RTE111 or
ThermoHaake Phoenix C25P1 waterbath. The temperature
of the bath was typically increased or decreased at a rate of
0.2C/min, using 0.2 or 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvettes. All
experiments were carried out in 10 mM sodium cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.0) containing 30–500 mM KCl. Taking into con-
sideration the TDSs and the high strand concentrations used
for some UV-melting experiments, we chose to record the
denaturation process at 290 nm (using cuvettes of 0.2 cm
optical pathlength for the highest concentrations) in order to
obtain an absorbance between 0.1 and 1.5. On the contrary, for
the thermodynamic analysis (see below), lower strand concen-
trations were used and the denaturation process was followed
at 275 nm where the signal is maximal. However, the observed
melting temperatures were in excellent agreement (usually
within 0.5C, data not shown) with the ones determined at
other wavelengths (e.g. 260 nm). All melting profiles were

perfectly reversible at the chosen temperature gradient, dem-
onstrating that these curves correspond to true equilibrium
curves (35).
Thermodynamic analysis
For all parameters listed below, the assumed direction of
the thermal process is the single-strand-to-hairpin transition.
The thermal reversibility and the known molecularity of the
process allow one to calculate the value of the equilibrium
constant (Ka) assuming a simple two-state transition model.
One must first convert absorbance measurements into folded
fraction by manually selecting two baselines corresponding to
the completely folded and unfolded form. An uncertainty may
therefore arise because of the subjectivity in baseline deter-
mination. Starting from the classical Gibbs enthalpy equation,
DG ¼ DH TDS
one can write, for a reversible reaction [in which DG ¼ RT
ln(Ka)], the following van’t Hoff equation:

where T is the temperature in Kelvin, while DHVH and DS

are, respectively, the standard enthalpy and the entropy change
of the reaction. In other words, provided that DHVH and DS

VH
are temperature-independent (see below), the so-called van’t
Hoff representation or Arrhenius plot [ln(Ka) versus 1/T]
should give a straight line, with a slope of DHVH=R and a
y-axis intercept of DSVH=R. The DH

VH of this reversible reac-
tion is called the van’t Hoff enthalpy and is defined by
DHVH ¼ 

In the case of temperature-dependent enthalpies and entropies,
one will obtain a significant deviation from linearity. Never-
theless, the above equation is still valid, but the slope at each
point may be different, leading to temperature-dependent
DHVH and DS

VH values. van’t Hoff enthalpies and entropies
are said to be ‘model-dependent’: they rely on a two-state
equilibrium hypothesis. They are, therefore, less robust than
the ‘model-independent’ thermodynamic values provided by
calorimetry (see below).
Determination of DCp
The linear fit of an Arrhenius plot assumes that DH is tem-
perature-independent, which in turn means that DCp ¼ 0.
DCp is the heat capacity change at constant pressure which
is occurring during the thermal process (considered in the
single-strand-to-hairpin direction). DHVH and DS

VH are linked
to DCp by the following relations:

The DCp ¼ 0 hypothesis (widely assumed for nucleic acids)
is now challenged. Several experiments have demonstrated
that the DHVH of a duplex (36–40) or a triplex (41) may
significantly depend on the temperature. In the case of
UV-melting curves it is often difficult to provide an estimate
of DCp (35) because of baseline assumption problems. A small
experimental error in ln(Ka) may obscure the temperature
dependence of DHVH (42). Nevertheless, the Arrhenius curves
analysed here were so deviant from linearity that reliable
non-zero DCp values could be extracted by fitting the plot
of ln(Ka) versus 1/T with Kaleidagraph 3.5, according to the
following equation:

where Tm is the melting temperature (in Kelvin) of the single-
strand-to-hairpin renaturation process, while DHTmVH and DS

VH
are, respectively, the enthalpy and entropy change of the ther-
mal transition at the melting temperature. In our case, they can
be reasonably considered equivalent to the DHVH and DS

VH,
respectively. The heat capacity change obtained by non-linear
fitting of the Arrhenius plot will be referred to in the text as
DCpVH.
Other methods may be used to measure the heat capacity
change such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which
uses the difference between the pre- and the post-transition
baselines (37), or even better, isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC). However, the DSC method is not always straight-
forward and requires an optimized experimental setting (40)
whereas ITC is not simply applicable to intramolecular
reactions.
Differential scanning calorimetry
Microcalorimetry experiments were performed on the (CTG)n
oligomers using a Nano DSC-II microcalorimeter (CSC) dri-
ven by a DSC-run software. The oligonucleotides were dis-
solved at concentrations ranging from 40 to 200 mM in 10 mM
sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7 containing 30 mM KCl.
Buffer and oligo solutions were carefully degassed prior to
their utilization and their thermal profiles were analysed in the
0–95C temperature range at a scan rate of 1C/min. An initial
calibration of the instrument was performed by filling both
cells with the buffer solution and accumulating several scans
until the balance was reached. Then, the DSC profile of the
oligo was obtained by loading the solution of the oligonuc-
leotide into the sample cell during the last cooling scan of the
calibration experiment, leaving the buffer solution into the
reference cell (load-on-the-fly method). With this method it
was possible to execute a preliminary setting up of the instru-
ment and to perform a real experiment in the same set of scans,
without compromising the shape and the calorimetric values of
the sample curve. A minimum of six scans was collected for
each experiment. Substraction of the baseline and calculation
of the thermodynamic parameters were carried out using the
Cp-Calc software (Applied Thermodynamics). We observed
that for all sequences tested here, the Tm values found by

DSC and UV-melting analysis were in good agreement. The
systematic small (
2C) difference in favour of the DSC Tm is
the result of the calorimetric definition of the melting temper-
ature, which corresponds to the temperature of maximum heat
release/uptake rather than to the temperature of half associ-
ation/dissociation. The real Tm (half association/dissociation
temperature) is therefore 2C below the DSC Tm, referred to
in the text as ‘Tcalmax’. The calorimetric enthalpy (DH

cal) and
entropy (DScal) for the transition process were determined in a
model-independent way from the DSC curve. Comparison
of the DHcal with the van’t Hoff value obtained by the UV-
thermal curve (DHVH) allowed us to confirm or infirm the
correctness of the previously assumed two-state model used
to describe the entire thermal process (x ¼ DHVH=DHcal ¼ 1).
Additional fitting of the experimental DSC curve with a more
general model equation (provided by the Cp-Calc software)
and its resolution by deconvolution analysis allowed us to
obtain the value of DCpCal for the whole process, as well as
the thermal profile of the ‘daughter’ subcurves corresponding
to the intermediate transitions. Deconvolution of the DSC
curves represents one of the major advantages of the calori-
metric analysis over the spectroscopic one. In fact, while by
UV analysis small differences in melting temperature between
independent subunits may be masked by an even smaller con-
formational change in the overall structure (giving rise to an
apparent two-state transition profile of the UV-thermal curve),
deconvolution of the calorimetric curve into its components
can allow for unravelling intermediate states.
Nuclease susceptibility assays
Prior to structural probing reactions, 50 end-labelled oligonuc-
leotides were subjected to denaturation by heating the samples
at 90C for 3 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature.
(CTG)n sequences (with n ¼ 15, 16, 20 or 25) were analysed
by enzymatic probing in the presence of increasing concentra-
tions of S1 nuclease (0.1–4 U/ml) and MB nuclease (1–10 U/ml).
For both nucleases (Promega), limited digestions of 50 end-
labelled oligonucleotides were performed at 30C for 5 min
in a buffer composed of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM
MgCl2 and 30 mM KCl. All the reactions were stopped by
adding an equal volume of 100% formamide solution and
heating for 3 min at 90C. The nuclease digestion products
were subjected to electrophoretic runs (70 W, 1500 V, 90 min)
on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (15%) containing 7 M urea/
TBE 1· and revealed on a phosphorimager screen (Typhoon;
Molecular Dynamics). The cleavage sites for the two nucle-
ases were determined by comparison of the enzymatic diges-
tion products with size markers corresponding to (CAG)n
treated with formic acid, (CTG)n treated with DMS and
seven non-treated size markers: (CTG)12, (CTG)10, (CTG)8,
(CTG)7, (CTG)6, (CTG)4 and (CTG)2. This determination was
not straightforward because of the differences in the cleavage
sites between chemical reactions (HCOOH or DMS) and
enzymatic reactions (S1 and MB nucleases). On the one
hand, the chemical reactions produce oligonucleotides with
a 30-phosphate end, whereas on the other hand, the enzymatic
reactions produce sequences with a 30-OH end. Therefore,
an untreated size marker and its corresponding one obtained
upon chemical cleavage of the parent oligo may not be equally
accelerated by the electric field, although they have the
same sequence [e.g. the (CTG)7 untreated size marker and
its corresponding one obtained upon treatment of (CTG)20
with formic acid].
RESULTS
Confirmation of the folded form and intramolecular
folding of CTG repeats
Several groups have previously demonstrated that repeats
adopt an intramolecular duplex structure [for a recent example
see (31)]. For this reason, we will very briefly describe the
experiments that were carried out to confirm this model in our
system. As shown in Supplementary Figures S1A and S1B,
DNA composed of pure (CTG)n repeats (n ¼ 4–10) exhibit
fast, strand concentration-independent, mobility on polyacryl-
amide gels (29,43–45) in good agreement with an intramolecu-
lar structure. This increased mobility is almost completely lost
under denaturing conditions (Supplementary Figures S1C and
S1D). CD spectra of CTG oligomers are similar to the CD
spectral signature of B-DNA with a negative peak 255 nm
and a positive peak 285 nm (Supplementary Figure S2) (31).
The concentration dependence of the melting temperature, Tm,
was measured to clarify the type of structure formed (Figure 1).
Plots of Tm versus C0 (where C0 is the total strand concentra-
tion) for a (CTG)n series of oligomers, where n ¼ 8, 15 or 25,
produced near-zero slopes (Figure 1B), indicating that uni-
molecular denaturations as also reported previously (31,46).
Thermal absorbance difference spectra
Another method, we recently proposed, to study the conforma-
tion of a nucleic acid is to record the ‘thermal absorbance
difference spectrum’ between its high and low temperature
UV-absorbance spectrum (33,34). The normalized TDS has
a shape which is specific for each nucleic acid conformation
studied so far, ranging from duplexes to quadruplexes:
as shown in Figure 2A, the shapes of TDS for (CTG)n
(n ¼ 8–20) were all very close (red curves) suggesting that
these oligomers adopt a similar folded conformation. Further-
more, these spectra with two maxima 275 and 235 nm are
highly reminiscent of pure GC-rich B-DNA TDS [blue curve
and (34)]. A similar analysis was performed for CAG repeats
(Figure 2B); although the TDS were not superimposable (com-
pare panels A and B), these spectra were also reminiscent of
GC-rich B-DNA TDS, but completely different from the ones
of other structures such as quadruplexes (33). It is interesting
to note that the CTG spectra are very close to the 100% GC
spectra (47) (Figure 2A, in blue; these duplexes correspond to
sequences where only GC base pairs are formed), whereas
CAG repeats resemble mixed duplexes (Figure 2B, in black;
these duplexes involve 67% GC/33% TA base pairs).
Analysis of the melting profiles
Careful analysis of the UV-melting profiles revealed several
observations. First, the melting temperature of (CTG)n and
(CAG)n was weakly dependent on oligonucleotide length
(example provided in Supplementary Figure S3; see also
Figure 1B). For the CTG oligomers tested here, the Tms varied
between 54 (n ¼ 6) and 58.7C (n ¼ 25) (Table 1), while for
(CAG)n the Tms varied between 51.6 (n ¼ 6) and 54C
(n ¼ 25) (Supplementary Table S1).

Second, the Arrhenius representation of the melting curves
also revealed a more complex behaviour (35). Determination
of the folded fraction for the two samples analysed in
Supplementary Figure S3 led to the Arrhenius plots are
shown in Figure 3. A significant and reproducible deviation
from linearity is seen in both cases. As described previously
(Materials and Methods), it is possible to fit these curves to
obtain the DCpVH values (Table 1). Assuming a reaction in the
single-strand-to-hairpin direction, these values were found to
be always negative, in agreement with the studies on different
DNA structures but with surprisingly high absolute values
for long sequences [e.g. (CTG)20, (CTG)25 and (CAG)25].
Additionally, even if some discrepancies may be found, the
DCp values deduced from van’t Hoff plots (DC

pVH) were gen-
erally in good agreement with those deduced from calorimetry
(DCpCal; Tables 1 and S1).
Third, the thermal stability of these trinucleotide repeats
was analysed as a function of KCl concentration. As expected,
the Tm values for the (CTG)8 oligomer were found to be
indeed dependent on KCl concentration (Supplementary
Figure S4): a 10-fold increase in potassium concentration
led to a 7C increase in Tm (from 50C at 10 mM KCl to
57C at 100 mM KCl). This ionic strength dependence is
somewhat lower than previously reported (16) and lower
than expected for regular double-stranded hairpins.
Calorimetric analysis of (CTG)n
The calorimetric values of the enthalpy (DHcal) and entropy
(DScal) of renaturation for the CTG oligomers are reported in
Table 1 and an example of a DSC denaturation run of (CTG)25
is provided in Figure 4A. As in the UV-thermal analysis,

the Tcalmax determined by DSC was almost sequence-length
independent (Figure 4B). Next, the van’t Hoff enthalpy
determined by the analysis of the UV-thermal transition
curve (DHVH) was compared to the calorimetric value
obtained by DSC (DHcal) (Figure 4C and D). For relatively
short sequences (n ¼ 4–12) the ratio x ¼ DHVH=DHcal was
close to 1 (1.08 ± 0.13; Table 1). The similarity of the two
values validated the hypothesis of the two-state model used in
the van’t Hoff analysis to describe the thermal transition of the
intramolecular trinucleotide repeat. However, in the case of
longer sequences, the DHVH=DH

cal ratio dramatically dropped
to values 0.4 (Figure 4D). The DHVH failed to become
more negative with increased repeat number, whereas DHcal
continued to increase (in absolute terms) explaining why the
agreement was lost (Figure 4C and Table 1). The difference
was highly significant as the errors bars (Figure 4C) on DHVH
and DHcal were 6% or lower.
Calorimetric analysis of (CAG)n
The thermal behaviour observed for the CTG repeats was
compared with that obtained from CAG repeats of identical
length under the same experimental conditions. An example of
a DSC denaturation run for a (CAG)n oligo is provided in
Figure 5A. Again, we observed that, for all sequences tested,
the Tcalmax and the Tm values found by DSC and UV-melting
analysis were in good agreement and almost independent on
sequence-length (Figure 5B). As shown in Figure 5C and D,
the values of DHVH and DH

cal for the (CAG)n thermal denat-
urations were compared and plotted against the number of
triplet repeats, leading to the same conclusions drawn for
the (CTG)n analogs (see also Supplementary Table S1).
Enzymatic probing of long CTG repeats
Nuclease sensitivity studies were performed with S1 and MB
nuclease that are two single-strand specific endonucleases.
The bases contained in the single-stranded regions of the
structures adopted by long CTG repeats are preferentially
cleaved with respect to the ones contained in the double-
stranded regions. The cleavage sites for the two nucleases
were determined by comparison with size markers (Materials
and Methods). The enhanced MB digestion of (CTG)15
occurred at three main regions (Figure 6A): (i) two sites at
the 30 end, G13 and G14; (ii) five sequence-centred sites
around the (CTG)7 (T4) marker, i.e. C7, T7, G7, C8 and
T8 resulting from a TGCT-loop; and (iii) two sites around
the 50 end region identified as G1 and C2 representing a
CTG-loop. S1 digestion of (CTG)15 presents only two sites
around the same 50 end region cleaved by the MB nuclease: G1
and C2 (Figure 6B). Similarly, two loops were characterized
for (CAG)15: one central loop composed of two repeats

Figure S5).
The enhanced digestion of (CTG)16 occurred at three main
regions (Figure 7A): (i) two sites at the 30 end: G14 and G15;
(ii) two sequence-centred sites around the (CTG)8 (T3) mar-
ker: T8 and G8 resulting from a CTG-loop; and (iii) two sites
around the 50 end region identified as G1 and C2, indicating a
CTG-loop. These two CTG-loops are conserved in (CTG)20
(Figure 6A and B) with the following digestion sites: (i) two
sequence-centred sites around the (CTG)10 (T2) marker: T10
and G10 and (ii) two sites around the 50 end region identified as
G1 and C2.
Finally, (CTG)25 presents the same kind of loops as (CTG)15
(Supplementary Figure S6): (i) four sequence-centred sites
around the (CTG)12 (T1) marker: T12, G12, C13 and T13
resulting from a 4 nt loop; and (ii) two sites around the
50 end region identified as G1 and C2, representing a CTG-
loop. Thus, our data show that all these sequences present one
centred loop of 3 or 4 nt and one loop at the 50 end containing
3 nt (Figures 6C and 7B). In theory, this terminal loop could
also correspond to DNA end fraying, but in this case we would
have obtained four cleavage sites: C1, T1, G1 and C2 at
the 50 end region instead of the only two sites G1 and C2.
Furthermore, two NMR studies on short CTG repeats
sequences have demonstrated that the T–T mismatches, all
over the stem of the hairpin, are very well stacked between
the two adjacent CpG base pairs and are bound to each other by
two hydrogen bonds (35). The DNA end fraying hypothesis is
therefore unlikely, as will be confirmed in the following part.
(CTG)15 variant sequences

cuts of the 50 end nucleotides do not represent DNA end
fraying, the C and G bases of the single-strand regions of

were replaced by T bases. The DTcalmax and renaturation
enthalpy of the modified oligonucleotide sequences were
then measured by DSC and compared to the ones of the
unmodified analog (Table 2). Replacement of C2 and G2
(as well as of G7 and C8) by two T bases did not influence
the renaturation enthalpy. In fact, despite a little decrease in
the DTcalmax (2.5C) of the modified sequences, their enthalpy
remained around 80 kcal/mol as for the unmodified (CTG)15.
This suggests that these four bases, i.e. C2, G2, G7 and C8, do
not belong to the stem region of the hairpin but to the unpaired
regions of the structure. The small difference in DTcalmax could
be the result of little variations in the ionic conditions between
the modified and the unmodified samples or errors in data
acquisition/baseline determination. More importantly, this
DTcalmax is defined as the maximum of the DSC curve (Materials
and Methods) and does not necessarily correspond to the real
Tm (half association/dissociation temperature): it is therefore
not the best parameter to assess the stability of a structure. At
this purpose, the model-independent DHcal of the renaturation
process is a more suitable parameter, directly related to the
number of base pairs involved in the molecule. Thus, the
constancy of this value for T-replacement of C2, G2, G7
and C8, undoubtedly indicates that these four bases do not
belong to the stem region of the hairpin but to unpaired regions
of the structure. In contrast, we obtained a dramatic decrease,
in absolute value, of the renaturation enthalpy (from 80 till
54.8, 51.8 and 51.4 kcal/mol) by replacing C3, C7 and
G8 by a T base, thus showing that these three bases belong
instead to the stem region of the structure.
DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to analyse the assumption of a quasi
‘normal’ hairpin duplex for trinucleotide repeats, namely
the CTG and CAG repeat motifs. Little is known about the
exact conformation of long trinucleotide repeats. Several stud-
ies have previously demonstrated that long trinucleotide
repeats adopt more compact structures than the short ones,
suggesting the hypothesis of a multi-folded structure rather

than a single-hairpin (16,29). Few NMR or crystallographic
studies have actually analysed ‘pure’ CNG repeats, as they are
usually embedded into different sequence motifs [e.g.
GCGGTTTGCGG in (48) and TGGCGGC in (49); for a
review see (50)]. Disease-related CNG repeats exhibit a pro-
pensity for folding at chain lengths as short as 12 residues (14).
CTG-containing sequences have been studied with a variety of
other techniques, including PAGE, KMnO4 modification, P1
nuclease digestion, UV-absorbance and molecular dynamic
simulations [reviewed in (51)]. To date, the hairpin structure
of sequences shorter than 10 repeats has been clearly estab-
lished (15,28), but the nature of the compact structures
observed for longer repeats is still unclear.
In this paper, CD, electrophoresis, UV and DSC data
revealed sharp structural transitions, in agreement with the
formation of a rather simple canonical B-DNA hairpin,
with a stem length growing with the repeat number. However,
independent results indicate that the energetics and/or struc-
ture of these intramolecular trinucleotide repeats were signi-
ficantly altered when compared with the canonical B-DNA,
especially for (relatively) long (CTG)n sequences. Qualitat-
ively similar results were obtained for (CAG)n repeats, sug-
gesting that this behaviour may be a general phenomenon for
(CNG)n oligonucleotides.
First, the thermal stability of this structure (its Tm) was very
weakly dependent on the oligonucleotide length (Figures 4B
and 5B and Supplementary Figure S3). The weak sequence-
length dependence of the Tm of these repeats was previously
observed for (CTG)10 and (CTG)30 (16); (CTG)10 and (CTG)25
(17); (CTG)10 and (CTG)15 (31) as well, but has never been
systematically studied [with a notable exception for (CUG)n
RNAs; n ¼ 5–69 (52)]. In our experience, the thermal stability
of DNA hairpins increases rapidly with the stem length, in
complete opposition to what is observed here. This behaviour

is therefore highly irregular for a simple hairpin system.
Second, the analysis of the melting curves did not lead to
simple Arrhenius plots, as significant and reproducible curva-
tures were observed. We actually had to manually select an
unlikely lower baseline in order to ‘linearize’ the Arrhenius
representations (Supplementary Figure S7). At least three non-
exclusive reasons may be proposed to explain this non-linear
behaviour: (i) a non-two-state transition (partially melted
structures are significantly populated), (ii) two (or more)
intermingled transitions occur or (iii) a single two-state trans-
ition occurs with a highly negative DCpVH (i.e. a temperature-
dependent DH). This last possibility which was, until recently
(53,54), overlooked for nucleic acids transitions, should be
seriously considered here. The comparison of the model-
dependent and model-independent DH values provides
interesting clues.
Length-dependent discrepancy between van’t Hoff
and calorimetry enthalpy
Several groups have reported important discrepancies between
the van’t Hoff enthalpy (DHVH) and the calorimetry enthalpy
(DHcal) for various nucleic acids structures (55), although
not for trinucleotides. For (CTG)n and (CAG)n repeats, we
observed that the melting temperatures found by DSC and
van’t Hoff analysis of the UV-melting curves were always
in reasonable agreement; however, the model-dependent
and the model-independent enthalpies were not always
identical (Figures 4C and 5C and Tables 1 and S1). For relat-
ively short (CTG)n or (CAG)n sequences (n ¼ 4–12) the
DHVH=DH

cal ratio was close to 1, validating the hypothesis
of the two-state model used in the van’t Hoff analysis. In the

case of longer sequences, the DHVH=DH

cal ratio dramatically
dropped (Figures 4D and 5D) to values 0.4 (for CTG repeats)
or 0.5 (for CAG repeats). This length-dependent difference
between the two enthalpy values suggests the hypothesis of a
non-two-state transition model for longer sequences. That is,
above a critical threshold number of trinucleotide repetitions
(n ¼ 10–12), a change in the structural organization of the
oligonucleotides occurs, going from a simple hairpin–stem
model to a structure of higher complexity, composed of dif-
ferent independent units. Therefore,
(i) Below 12 repeats, no significant difference between the
two DH values was observed, leading to their similar
increase with sequence-length. For these relatively short
sequences the two-state transition model was confirmed
by deconvolution of the DSC profiles (Figure 8A) into
a single transition, indicating their folding into a simple
hairpin structure.
(ii) Beyond 12 repeats, instead, an increasing discrepancy
between the DH values appeared, with the model-
independent DHcal still increasing in a length-dependent
manner, whereas the two-state model-dependent DHVH
remained quasi-constant. In contrast with a previous report
(31), no plateau was observed inDHcal for sequences longer
than 15 trinucleotide repeats (Figures 4C and 5C). For
long oligomers, the two-state hypothesis was no longer
valid, suggesting the formation of a more complex structure
with at least two independent units. This observation was
confirmed by deconvolution of the DSC profiles into a
three-state equilibrium with two intermediate transitions
(Figure 8B).
In other words, for short sequences, folding into a single-
hairpin structure is relatively simple, leading to a good
concordance between DHcal and DH

VH. For long sequences
(at least 12), rather than adopting a regular long stem, the
oligonucleotide seems to maintain a relatively short and con-
stant length of the stem region while the remaining part fold
into several (at least two) independent folding units, of not
necessarily the same length, which melt in an independent
fashion. In that case, a multi-branched hairpin should have
a relatively apparent constant van’t Hoff enthalpy, as seen by
UV-melting analysis, but an increased calorimetric enthalpy,
as observed by DSC. This different folding trend for longer
sequences may be explained in terms of a favourable enthalpy–
entropy compensation. In fact, although a long single-hairpin
structure should indeed have a more favourable renaturation
enthalpy (owing to maximization of the number of base pairs),
it has not necessarily the most favourable free energy. On the
contrary, branched hairpin structures may offer additional
degrees of freedom, possibly lowering the unfavourable
entropic term and thus explaining their preferential formation
for longer sequences.
Nuclease assays
The enzymatic assays on long sequences (Figures 6 and 7 and
Supplementary Figures S5 and S6), additionally confirmed
by the DSC analysis of the (CTG)15-modified sequences
(Table 2), suggested that a simple hairpin was not necessarily
the chosen structure, as other bases close to the 50 end of the
sequence were cleaved by single-strand specific nucleases.
However this is in contrast with the previous results obtained
using other enzymatic and chemical probes (43,56). According
to the biophysical and biochemical data obtained in this study,
we propose a possible ‘bis-hairpin’ folding pattern for
(CTG)15 and (CTG)16, as shown in Figures 6C and 7B.
The different number of cut sites between the (CTG)n
sequences (n ¼ 15, 16, 20 or 25) probably reflect the different
number of bases in the loops for the odd and even number
of repeats (57). At least two NMR studies (15,28) have demon-
strated that (CTG)n sequences (n ¼ 1–10), with an even
number of repeats, fold into a hairpin structure containing a
4 nt TGCT-loop whereas an odd number of repeats leads to a

3 nt CTG-loop hairpin. It is interesting to note that, in our
study, this tendency is reversed for longer sequences: (CTG)15
and (CTG)25 present a centred 4 nt TGCT-loop, while (CTG)16
and (CTG)20 present a centred 3 nt CTG-loop. Thus, this
inversion confirms the presence of a second loop composed
of an odd number of CTG repeats at the 50 end of the sequence.
CONCLUSIONS
Above a critical threshold number of trinucleotide repetitions
(n ¼ 12–15), a change in the structural organization of the
oligonucleotides occurs going from a simple hairpin–stem
model to a structure of higher complexity composed of dif-
ferent independent units such as a bis- (or multi-branched)
hairpin-like structure. In contrast with a recent report (31),
our calorimetric data suggest that the enthalpic stability of
this structure is not compromised as the length of the hairpin
overcomes 15 repeats. The possible intramolecular bis-hairpin
model could be generalized as an intramolecular ‘multi-
branched’ hairpin model for pathological sequences as long
as 3000 repetitions. The 3 or 4 nt bulges disseminated all over
the repeated sequence could be involved in the instability
process during DNA replication through the formation of
slipped-out DNA structures, but may also represent an
important feature to discriminate trinucleotide repeats against
canonical B-DNA for targeting by small repeat-specific bulge-
ligands. This instability has been ascribed to the energy of the
structure but in our case it could be explained in terms of
number of hairpin loops that introduce an additional steric
parameter to the energetic one. These results have encouraged
us to carry on further investigations for a better understanding
of the thermodynamics of these repetitions, and stimulating
additional studies directed to the structural elucidation of long
trinucleotide repeat models. We will now pursue similar stud-
ies on other DNA and RNA trinucleotides [(CGG)n, (CCG)n
and (CUG)n (58,59)] to see whether these observations may
be extended to other CNG repeats.
