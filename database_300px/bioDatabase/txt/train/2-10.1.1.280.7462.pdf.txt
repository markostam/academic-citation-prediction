ABSTRACT
The multifunctional mammalian apurinic/apyrimi-
dinic (AP) endonuclease (APE) participates in the
repair of AP sites in the cellular DNA as well as par-
ticipating in the redox regulation of the transcription
factor function. The function of APE is considered as
the rate-limiting step in DNA base excision repair.
Paradoxically, an unbalanced increase in APE protein
leads to genetic instability. Therefore, we investigated
the mechanisms of genetic instability that are induced
by APE. Here, we report that the overexpression of
APE protein disrupts the repair of DNA mismatches,
which results in microsatellite instability (MSI). We
found that expression of APE protein led to the sup-
pression of the repair of DNA mismatches in the
normal human fibroblast cells. Western blot analysis
revealed that hMSH6 protein was markedly reduced in
the APE-expressing cells. Moreover, the addition of
purified Muta (MSH2 and MSH6 complex) to the
extracts from the APE-expressing cells led to the
restoration of mismatch repair (MMR) activity. By per-
forming MMR activity assay and MSI analysis, we
found that the co-expression of hMSH6 and APE
exhibited the microsatellite stability, whereas the
expression of APE alone generated the MSI-high
phenotype. The APE-mediated decrease in MMR
activity described here demonstrates the presence
of a new and highly effective APE-mediated mecha-
nism for MSI.
INTRODUCTION
The major human apurinic and apyrimidinic (AP) endonucle-
ase APE (also known as Hap1, Apex and Ref-1), which is
homologous to Escherichia coli exonuclease III, plays a cen-
tral role for both short-patch and long-patch base excision
repair (1–3). APE acts in the base excision repair pathways
to hydrolyze the abasic sites that arise from the enzymatic
removal of damaged purine and pyrimidine bases, and APE
also cleaves the abasic sites arising from the spontaneous
hydrolysis of damaged bases. In addition to its AP endonu-
clease activity, this enzyme also exhibits 30!50 exonuclease,
phosphodiesterase, 30-phosphatase and Rnase H activities
(4,5). APE has recently been shown to have a 30-mismatch
exonuclease activity (6), and also a nucleotide incision repair
activity (7), so it might well be considered as a proofreading
enzyme. APE is a multifunctional protein that is not only
responsible for the repair of AP sites, but it also has been
implicated in the redox regulation of the transcription factor
DNA binding activity via the reduction of conserved cysteine
residues in the DNA binding domains of several transcription
factors (1). These factors include the activator protein-1
(AP-1), c-Fos, c-Jun, nuclear factor (NF)-kB, p53, HIF-1a
and Pax protein. Furthermore, APE acts as a negative regulator
of its own gene and other genes too, such as those genes coding
for the parathyroid hormones (8).
Paradoxically, the microsatellite instability (MSI)-high
group has a significantly high APE activity, and a higher
APE activity appears to generate MSI in the dinucleotide
repeats (9). In addition, expression of APE in human ery-
throleukemia cells generates frameshift mutations in the
microsatellite markers (9), and the overexpression of APE
results in an increase of 40% in the frequency of micronuclei
and 33% in sister chromatid exchanges of CHO mutant cells
(10). This suggests that an increase in the APE expression
contributes to MSI; however, the mechanisms by which
APE produce MSI are unknown.
In this study, we explore how APE generates MSI. We show
that APE expression in the human fibroblast GM00637 cells
inhibits mismatch repair (MMR) activity. We also provide
evidence that APE decreases the level of hMSH6 protein,

which is a key component in the MMR pathway. In addition,
we show that the addition of hMutSa (heterodimers of
hMSH2/hMSH6) to the extracts of APE-expressing cells
restores the MMR activity. Moreover, we show that APE
overexpression in the GM00637 cells generates frameshift
mutations in the microsatellite markers having dinucleotide
repeats, and also that hMSH6 expression inhibits the APE-
mediated generation of MSI. Our results have an implication
for how APE induces MSI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human fibroblast GM00637 cells (Coriell Institute
for Medical Research) were maintained in Eagle’s minimum
essential medium (EMEM) that was supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The HEC59 and HEC59-
chr2 cells (a generous gift from Dr Richard Boland,
University of California) were cultured in Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) that was supplemented with
10% FBS.
Preparation of the constructs and clones
Human APE cDNA and human MSH6 (hMSH6) cDNA were
amplified by RT–PCR using the APE oligo primer (50-ATG
CCG AAG CGT GGG AAA AAG G-30, 50-TCA CAG TGC
TAG GTA TAG GGT G-30) and the hMSH6 oligo primer (50-
ATG TCG CGA CAG AGC ACC CTG-30, 50-CTA TAA TTC
CTT AAT CAA AGT CAG-30), respectively, from human
fibroblast GM00637 cells. After confirming the DNA
sequences, the APE cDNA was cloned into a pcDNA3 mam-
malian expression vector, and the hMSH6 cDNA was cloned
into a pcDNA3/Hygro mammalian expression vector
(Invitrogen). The transfections were performed using the
LipofectAMINE method (Promega) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. After transfection, the cells were
incubated in complete medium containing 400 mg/ml G418
or 200 mg/ml hygromycine for 4–5 weeks. The cell clones
that were resistant to G418 (for pc DNA3/APE) or
hygromycine (for pcDNA3/Hygro-hMSH6) were isolated
and analyzed.
Construction of adenoviral vector encoding hAPE cDNA
The APE cDNA was cloned into a pShuttle vector (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) after confirming the DNA sequence. The newly
constructed plasmid pShuttle-hAPE was then doubly digested
with PI-SceI/I-CeuI, and the purified product was ligated using
Adeno-X DNA. The DNA was linearized with PacI and puri-
fied before Liopfectamine (Invitrogen) transfection of
HEK293 cells. After transduction, HEK293 cells layers
were overlaid with agarose and assessed for viral plaque
formation at 10 days. For virus collection, the cells were
lysed with three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles, and the
virus was collected from the supernatant. The virus titer
was 1 · 107 p.f.u./ml, which was determined using an
end-point dilution assay. A vector carrying the b-galactosidase
gene LacZ (Ad-LacZ) was used to monitor the efficiency of
transduction by the viral vectors and a nonspecific transgene
expression controls.
Purification of human MutSa
Human MutSa was purified from the nuclear extracts of
HeLaS3 cells, as described with some modifications (11).
In brief, the samples used for hMutSa purification were pre-
cipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts between 30 and 65%
ammonium sulfate saturation. The extract was diluted three
times before being loaded onto a single-stranded DNA cellu-
lose column (1 · 1.5 cm; United States Biochemical). The
proteins were eluted by a 10 ml of 0.2–1 M NaCl gradient
in buffer A; the fractions containing the MSH2–MSH6 com-
plex were diluted to bring the conductivity of the pool to an
equivalent to 100 mM NaCl before being loaded onto Mono S
(HR5/5). The bound proteins were eluted with a 20 ml of
0.1–1 M NaCl gradient in buffer A. the purified hMutSa
was immediately supplemented with 1.0 mg/ml BSA and
10% (w/v) sucrose, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at
80C. Purified hMutSa retained full activity under these
storage conditions for at least 3 months. SDS–PAGE indicated
that the purified protein contained only two polypeptides,
160 kDa hMSH6 and 105 kDa hMSH2, based on Coomassie
Brilliant blue staining (Figure 6A).
Western blotting
The cells were washed with PBS and lysed at 0C for 30 min in
a lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 50 mM
glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM
DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leu-
peptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM Na3VO4 and 5 mM NaF).
The protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad
dye-binding microassay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 20 mg
protein per lane was electrophoresed on 10% SDS polyacry-
lamide gels. The proteins were blotted onto Hybon ECL mem-
branes (Amersham-Phamacia, Biotech) and immunoblotting
was carried out with anti-MSH2, anti-MSH6, anti-hMLH1
and anti-a-tubulin antibodies (Pharmingen), and also with
hPMS2 (Calbiochem) The blotted proteins were then detected
using an enhanced chemiluminescence detect system
(iNtRON, Biotech, Seoul, Korea).
Northern blotting
The total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Gibco-BRL), sepa-
rated by electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose
filter in 20· SSC, and then baked at 80C for 2 h. The filters
were hybridized using a 32P-labeled hMSH6 cDNA probe.
After hybridization, the same membrane was re-probed
with a 32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA probe. Hybridization was
carried out in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS,
1 M NaCl at 42C for 16 h, followed by two 10 min washes at
room temperature with 2· SSC and one 30 min wash at 65C
in 2· SSC-1% SDS.
In vitro MMR assay
The in vitro MMR activities of the control cells and the APE-
expressing cells were measured using the M13mp2 lacZ
a-complementation method as described previously (12).
Briefly, the MMR repair activities were investigated using
heteroduplex DNA that contained a G–T, G–G or G–A mis-
match in the lacZ a-complementation gene in the M13mp2
DNA. The mismatch was at position +88, and a nick was
present in the () strand at position264. The repair reactions
5074 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 16
(in 25 ml vol) contained 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 7 mM
MgCl2, 4 mM ATP, 200 mM each of CTP, GTP and UTP,
100 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP and dCTP, 40 mM crea-
tine phosphate, 100 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 15 mM
sodiumphosphate, 5ng ofpurifiedheteroduplex DNA and50mg
of the extracted nuclear protein. The incubation was carried
out at 37C for 30 min. The DNA heteroduplex was then
purified and introduced into a mutS strain via electroporation.
When introduced into an E.coli strain deficient in methyl-
directed heteroduplex repair (mutS), an unrepaired mismatch
heteroduplex yields a ‘mixed’ plaque phenotype due to expres-
sion of both strands of the M13mp2 DNA. However, if repair
of the mismatched base situated on the () strand takes place
during incubation with a human cell extract, the percentage of
mixed plaques decreases and the percentage of colorless (+)
plaques increases, such that ratio of pure blue to pure colorless
plaques is reduced. The DNA MMR activity was calculated
from the following formula: 100% · [1  (percentage of
mixed colored plaques developed from the reaction containing
the extract/percentage of mixed colored plaques developed
from the reaction containing no extract)].
MSI analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from each of the cell populations
(the parental control cells, empty vector transfected cells,
APE-expressing cells, APE and pcDNA3 expressing cells,
and the APE and hMSH6 expressing cells), using the standard
protocol. The markers for MSI were chosen based on the
recommendations from the National Cancer Institute Work-
shop on Microsatellite Instability (13). The following panel of
five loci was examined: BAT 25, BAT 26, D5S346, D2S123
and D17S250. PCR amplifications were performed with 100 ng
of purified genomic DNA in an MJ Research Thermocycler
(PTC-100; MJ Research, Watertown, MA). Subsequently,
PCR products were analyzed by 8% denaturing polyacry-
lamide gel electrophoresis. MSI was readily determined by
the presence of clearly visualized altered allelic shifts in the
PCR products when compared with the control DNA derived
from GM00637 cells. MSI status was independently evaluated
by two blinded observers, and PCRs for microsatellite analysis
were performed at least three times for all samples that exhib-
ited MSI. The cells overexpressing APE or both APE and
hMSH6 were characterized as having high-frequency MSI
(MSI-High) if two or more of the five markers showed instab-
ility; they were characterized as having low-frequency MSI
(MSI-Low) if only one of the five markers showed instability;
or if no MSI was found, then they were classified as having
microsatellite stability.
Data analysis
Data in all experiments are represented as mean ± SD.
Statistical comparisons were carried out using unpaired t-test.
P-values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
APE inhibits MMR activity
To investigate whether the APE expression influenced the
DNA MMR activity, the human APE gene was subcloned
into the pcDNA3 vector to form pcDNA3–APE. This construct
was then transfected into the GM00637 human fibroblast cells.
Several stable transfected cell lines were established after the
cell selection was carried out for 5 weeks using G418. Western
blot analysis revealed that the APE expression levels in the
APE transfected GM00637 clones (clones-1, -3, -6 and -7)
were significantly higher than those APE expression levels
of the parental cells and the empty vector transfected cells
(Figure 1).
The nuclear extracts were then prepared and examined for
their MMR ability using three heteroduplexes containing these
different DNA mismatches that were derived from bacterio-
phage M13mp2 DNA. Unrepaired heteroduplex plasmids gen-
erated mixed-color colonies when transfected into E.coli.
Repaired reaction by cell lysate resulted in decreased numbers
of mixed-color colonies. As shown in Figure 2, parental
GM00637 cell extracts and pcDNA3-transfected GM00637
cell extracts efficiently repaired all three mispairs. However,
APE expressing GM00637 clones were deficient in MMR
function and had limited MMR activities. These results

demonstrate that the APE-expressing cells exhibited a
decrease in MMR activity.
APE-expressing cells exhibit reduced hMSH6
protein level
To determine whether APE protein affects the level of expres-
sion of the proteins involved in the MMR pathway, such as
hMSH2, hMSH6, hMHL1 and hPMS2, we used SDS–PAGE
to separate the whole cell protein extracts from the parental
control cells, the empty vector transfected cells and the APE
expressing GM00637 clone-3 and clone-7. The western blot-
ting results using specific polyclonal antibodies against
hMSH2, hMSH6, hMHL1 and hPMS2 showed a significant
decrease in the level of MSH6 protein in the APE-expressing
cells (Figure 3). The hMSH6 signal intensities were calculated
as percentages ± SD of the a-tubulin signal. The levels of
MSH6 protein expression were reduced by 84 ± 3.3% 
88 ± 3.9% in the APE-expressing cells compared with the
parental cells (Figure 3, right panel), whereas the expression
of the other proteins were similar to those of the control cells.
To investigate whether APE can also suppress hMSH6 expres-
sion in other human cells, Ad-APE or Ad-LacZ was infected
into human pancreas cancer cell lines PC3 and human colon
cancer cell line DLD1. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells
were harvested and hMSH6 expression levels were deter-
mined. Western blot analysis revealed that the hMSH6 expres-
sion levels in the three individual Ad-APE infected cells were
significantly lower than that of the mock and Ad-LacZ infected
cells (Figure 4A). The G:G mismatch activity was next

Figure 4. hMSH6 expression after the adenovirus-mediated transfer of APE in human cells. (A) PC3 and DLD1 cells were transfected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-APE at an
m.o.i. of 50, and the cells were harvested 48 h after the infection. Protein extracts prepared 48 h after the infection with mock, Ad-LacZ or Ad-APE. mg of the total
protein was loaded on SDS polyacrylamide gel for western blot analysis. The antibodies against APE and hMSH6 were used. The detection of a-tubulin was used as
the loading control. (B) The nuclear extracts of the parental PC3 and DLD1 cells, Ad-LacZ infected cells and Ad-APE infected cells were used to determine the G:G
MMR efficiencies. The results are based on counting 500–1000 plaques per variable. The repair efficiency was calculated as the percentage of decrease in the mixed-
color colonies. The values are a mean ± SD from three separate experiments. Asterisk denotes P < 0.05.

examined, and it was found that APE expressing PC3 and
DLD1 cells showed reduced G:G MMR activity
(Figure 4B). These results demonstrate that hMSH6 expres-
sion can be suppressed by APE.
To further investigate whether the decreased hMSH6
expression in the APE-expressing cells occurs at the transcrip-
tional level, we carried out northern blotting using a probe for
hMSH6. We found that the levels of hMSH6 mRNA were not
different between the control cells and the APE-expressing
cells (Figure 5).
The addition of MutSa to extracts of the APE clones
restored mismatch repair
As MSH6 combines with MSH2 (to form the MutSa) is
responsible for the initial recognition of a mismatched
nucleotide (14), it was decided to determine whether the addi-
tion of purified human MutSa to the APE clones’ extracts
could restore the MMR activity. Thus, the extracts from the
GM00637 clone-3 and the clone-7 in the presence or absence
of purified MutSa (Figure 6A) were tested for their ability to
correct a heteroduplex that contained a G:G mismatch. We
found that the addition of purified recombinant MutSa to the
extracts of the APE-expressing clones resulted in the restora-
tion of the G:G MMR (Figure 6B). For controls, the MMR
activities were measured in an MMR-deficient human cell line
and in its complementary cell line: MSH2-deficient HEC59
and HEC59-chr2; these are derivatives of the HEC59 cells in
which the wild-type MSH2 expression has been restored via a
chromosome 2 transfer. The HEC59 extracts were deficient for
the repair of a G:G mismatch, whereas the addition of recom-
binant MutSa to the HEC59 extracts restored this MMR
(Figure 6B). These results suggest that the APE expression
results in the lack of a functional hMSH2 and hMSH6 het-
erodimer (the hMutSa), and this leads to a decrease in MMR
activity.
Expression of hMSH6 suppresses the APE-mediated
increase in microsatellite instability
To investigate whether the APE-mediated decrease in hMSH6
contributes to the APE-induced genomic instability, the
hMSH6 gene was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. The
APE and the hMSH6 constructs were cotransfected into
the GM00637 cells, and stable cell lines were established
after selection was done using G418 and hygromycine for
5–6 weeks. Western blot analysis revealed that the hMSH6

Figure 6. The hMutSa restores the repair of the G:G mismatches to the APE-expressing cells. (A) Purified hMutSa (hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer) was separated on
a SDS–PAGE (8%), which was stained with Coomassie blue. The first lane of gel contains pre stained protein size marker (MBI, Fermentas), and the second lane
contains hMSH6 (160 kDa) and hMSH2 (105 kDa). (B) The nuclear extracts of the control cells (637) and the APE expressing GM00637 cells (637 clone-3 and
clone-7), and the HEC59 cells and its complementary cells were assayed for the repair of a G:G mispair in the presence or absence of 40 ng of the purified recombinant
hMutSa. The results are based on counting 500–1000 plaques per variable. The repair efficiency was calculated as the percentage of decrease in the mixed-color
colonies. The values are a mean ± SD from three separate experiments. Asterisk denotes P < 0.05.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 16 5077
expression levels in the hMSH6 transfected GM00637
clone-2, clone-4 and clone-5 were significantly higher than
those hMSH6 expression levels of the empty vector trans-
fected cells (Figure 7A). We then measured the MMR activity,
and found that the MMR activities were restored in the hMSH6
expressing cells from 83 to 98% of the activity present in the
parental GM00637 cells (Figure 7B).
In order to determine whether down-regulation of the
hMSH6 gene was involved in the APE-induced MSI, we ana-
lyzed the five microsatellite markers that are used in colorectal
cancer (13). The cells were assessed for MSI at 55 popula-
tion doublings after selection was done using antibiotics.
When two or more of the five microsatellite markers showed
MSI, based on the MSI-criteria, MSI-High was then scored for
the cells. If only one of the five markers showed MSI, then this
was scored as MSI-low for the cells, and if none of the five
markers showed instability, the cell line was considered to
display microsatellite stable. MSI was observed in all four
APE-expressing clones, with five meeting criteria for MSI-
H (MSI in two or more loci), whereas the expression of APE
combined with hMSH6 showed microsatellite stability
(Table 1). These data suggest that unrepaired mismatch lesions
resulting from the suppression of the hMSH6 gene could be an
important cause of the MSI displayed by the APE-expressing
cells.
DISCUSSION
We have concluded that APE overexpression interferes with
the repair of DNA mismatches. Because the DNA MMR
mechanisms are essential for the maintenance of the genomic
integrity (14), impairment of the MMR alone is sufficient to
cause genetic instability. Suppression of the hMSH6 gene via
APE overexpression is likely to be responsible for the cellular
inability to efficiently repair DNA mismatches, and this results

Figure 7. MMR activities in the APE and hMSH6 expressing cells. (A) The total proteins were extracted from parental GM00637 cells (637), APE expressing
GM00637 clone-2 cells (APE), APE and pcDNA3 expressing GM00637 cells (APE-pcDNA), and APE and hMSH6 expressing GM00637 clones (APE-MSH6-2, -4,
-5). An aliquot of 50 mg of the total protein was loaded on SDS polyacrylamide gel for western blot analysis. The antibodies against hMSH6 and APE were used. The
detection of a-tubulin was used as the loading control. (B) The nuclear extracts of the A parental GM00637 cells (637), the APE expressing GM00637 clone-2 cells
(APE), the APE and pcDNA3 expressing GM00637 cells (APE-pcDNA), and the APE and hMSH6 expressing GM00637 clones (APE-MSH6-2, -4, -5) were used to
determine the G:G mismatch repair efficiencies. The results are based on counting 500–1000 plaques per variable. The repair efficiency was calculated as the
percentage of decrease in the mixed-color colonies. The values are a mean ± SD from three separate experiments. Asterisk denotes P < 0.05.

in the MSI activity described in this study. Our results
may explain the previous observations showing that APE over-
expression, ironically enough, results in increased MSI. Our
results are consistent with the possibility that the adaptive
imbalanced increase in APE protein may contribute to car-
cinogenesis by interfering with the repair of DNA mismatches.
MMR removes the DNA mismatches that have evaded
proofreading during the replication process. This versatile
post-replicative repair system efficiently corrects single base
mismatches and the loops of 1–3 extrahelical nucleotides that
arise during the replication of the repetitive DNA tracts
(15–18). Error correction is initiated with the binding by
one of two mismatch recognition complexes that have over-
lapping specificities, and this ensures the efficient repair of all
of the common replication errors. The MutSa and MutSb
mismatch recognition factors are heterodimers of hMSH2/
hMSH6 and hMSH2/hMSH3, respectively. The MutSa
complex is able to bind to and participate in the repair of
single base–base mismatches and of those containing insertion/
deletion loops, whereas the MutSb complex recognizes the
insertion/deletion loops that are essentially larger than the
single base mispairs (19–23). The data presented here show
that the MMR activity, as measured by monitoring the repair
of A:C, G:G and G:T mispairs, is markedly reduced in the
APE-expressing human fibroblast GM00637 cells (Figure 2).
In order to address the question as to what kind of MMR
protein might be involved in the APE-dependent reduction
of MMR activity, we compared the levels of MMR protein
in the control cells and in the APE-expressing cells, and we
found that the MSH6 protein was significantly decreased in the
APE-expressing cells (Figure 3). Because the hMSH6 protein
can bind to mismatched DNA when it is complexed with
MSH2 to form the MutSa heterodimers, we next investigated
if a reduced hMSH6 level contributed to the APE-dependent
decline in the MMR activity. Thus, we purified the MutSa
complex and performed MMR assays after adding MutSa to
the APE-expressing cell extracts. We found that purified
MutSa was able to restore MMR activity in the APE-
expressing cells (Figure 6). Therefore, these data suggest
that the reduced hMSH6 protein contributed to the suppression
of MMR activity in the APE-expressing cells.
The mechanisms of MSI have been evaluated, and espe-
cially for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).
These patients have many mutations in their colon tissue
and they frequently develop colon cancer during early adult-
hood. The etiology of the mutagenic propensity noted in
HNPCC comes from the defective DNA MMR enzymes,
and these defective enzymes are due to inactivating germline
mutations in the MMR genes (24–27). The cells with a defec-
tive DNA MMR demonstrate a mutation rate 100-fold greater
than that of normal cells, and this causes the accumulation
of potentially deleterious mutations throughout the genome.
These mutations preferentially affect the repetitive DNA
sequences and they are responsible for the occurrence of
MSI. APE activity was positively correlated with the degree
of MSI instability for the ulcerative colitis colon tissue, and
overexpression of APE protein in the human erythroleukemic
cells produced the MSI-high phenotype (9). In addition, the
overexpression of APE protein in an xrcc1/ background
led to an increased number of spontaneous sister chromatid
exchanges as well as the formation of micronuclei (10).
Moreover, a significant increase in APE protein expression
has been demonstrated for such malignancies as epithelial
ovarian cancers, cervical cancer tissues and their cell lines,
prostate cell tumors, gliomas, rhabdomyosarcoma and germ
cell tumors (28–33). A higher level of APE protein expression
was also reported to be associated with tumor progression (34).
This suggests that the imbalanced increase in APE protein may
lead to genetic instability and so contribute to carcinogenesis.
We have now shown that a decreased hMSH6 expression
contributes to the APE-mediated MSI. First, the APE overex-
pression suppressed the DNA MMR activity, and this defect
was reversed by the expression of hMSH6 protein (Figure 7).
In addition, the cells with the co-expression of hMSH6 and
APE protein exhibited microsatellite stability, whereas the
expression of APE protein alone generated the MSI-high
phenotype (Table 1). Therefore, the MMR deficiency can
arise from an APE overexpression, and this results in the
generation of MSI.
Free radicals are especially prevalent in active and chronic
inflammation (35). The production of free radicals induces
somatic mutations that can result in genetic instability, and
this can ultimately lead to carcinogenesis (36). MSI has been
shown to occur in tissues that are undergoing inflammation
(37–39). The prevailing hypothesis for the cause of the MSI
seen in chronic inflammatory disease is that the overexpres-
sion of free radicals eventually overwhelms the ability of the
cell to repair the DNA damage prior to replication (40,41).
Free radicals enhance the expression of APE in gastric epi-
thelial cells, and this is similar to the observations for other cell
types such as fibroblast, marcrophages, HeLa, B cells and
Chinese hamster ovarian cells (42–46). In addition, the gastric
epithelial cells isolated from those individuals chronically
infected with Helicobacter pylori were noted to express higher
levels of APE protein (47). Interestingly, the level of hMSH6
protein is dramatically reduced in erythroleukemia cells
exposed to free radicals (48). hMSH6 protein was also sig-
nificantly decreased in the rheumatoid arthritis synovium
where abundant MSI was observed (49). Moreover, an
increased cancer risk occurs in the tissues of the body under-
going chronic inflammation (50,51). Therefore, the suppres-
sion of the MMR activity due to APE expression induced
by the free radicals may be an underlying mechanism for
inflammation-mediated oncogenesis.
Although our study established that the APE expression
produced MSI by suppressing MMR activity, other repair
enzymes such as 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (9),
DNA polymerase b (52) and DNA polymerase k (53) can
also generate genetic instability when these proteins are over-
expressed. However, the expression of 3-methyladenine DNA
glycosylase, DNA polymerase b or DNA polymerase k did not
affect hMSH6 expression or the MMR activity in our system
(data not shown). Ongoing experiments are being carried out
to address this issue, and they involve examining the MSI
generating mechanisms in response to the overexpression of
3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, DNA polymerase b or
DNA polymerase k.
The important question that remains to be answered is
the detailed mechanisms of the APE-mediated decreased
MSH6 protein level. One hypothesis is that APE may
affect the MSH6 stability. Because APE acts as a redox regu-
lator, APE may affect the redox-sensitive residues of MSH6,
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 16 5079
resulting in the stimulation of MSH6 degradation. Although
four MMR proteins have similar percentages of aromatic and
sulfur-containing residues, MSH6 is more unstable than
MSH2 and MLH1 in response to oxidative stress (48).
Differential susceptibility to oxidative modification has also
been reported in plasma and mitochondria proteins (54,55).
Furthermore, APE is found to be a component of protein
complexes that binds to negative calcium response element
(nCaRE) (56), Ku70(Ku86) (57) and heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP-L) (58), where it may down-
regulate expression of those genes (59,60). Therefore, APE
may interact with a MSH6 protein, leading to the triggering the
MSH6 degradation. It is also possible that APE may affect the
hMSH6 protein synthesis. Accordingly, investigations aimed
at determining the detailed mechanism of the APE-associated
decrease in the MSH6 protein level are currently under way.
In summary, MMR activity is markedly suppressed in APE-
expressing human fibroblast GM00637 cells, and this suppres-
sion corresponds to the demonstrated declines in the levels of
MSH6 protein, a known key component in the MMR pathway.
Furthermore, the APE-mediated decrease in the MSH6 expres-
sion results in a reduced cellular MMR capacity as well as the
increased generation of MSI. The potential role of APE to
generate MSI may have clinically important implications
for cancer susceptibility and carcinogenesis.
