[1] We thank Michel [2005] for the opportunity to im-
prove our bed load transport equation [Barry et al., 2004,
equation (6)] and to resolve the dimensional complexity that
he identified. However, we do not believe that the alterna-
tive bed load transport equation proposed by Michel [2005]
provides either the mechanistic insight or predictive power
of our transport equation.
[2] Although some bed load transport data exhibit non-
linear trends in log-log plots of transport rate versus
discharge, a simple linear function is sufficient to describe
our data [Barry et al., 2004, paragraph 43]. The Figure 7
data of Barry et al. [2004] could be fit by a nonlinear
function as suggested by Michel [2005], but we believe this
to be an unnecessary complication, particularly given how
well our simple equation predicts observed transport rates
compared to other more complex equations, such as
Parker’s [1991] three-part bed load transport function
[Barry et al., 2004, Figure 11]. Furthermore, an important
aspect of our equation, that is not preserved in Michel’s
alternative, is the between-site variation in the exponent of
the transport function that results from supply related
channel armoring (i.e., transport capacity in excess of bed
load sediment supply) which provides a mechanistic under-
standing of the bed load transport process [Barry et al.,
2004].Michel [2005] proposes a bed load transport equation
that mimics our equation in terms of the range of exponents
that we observe (i.e., 1.5–4 [Barry et al., 2004, Figure 8a]
but lacks the mechanistic insight and consequent predictive
power. Moreover, Michel’s equation requires a sufficient
number of bed load transport observations across a broad
range of discharges to empirically calibrate his a and b
values.
[3] Michel [2005] correctly points out a dimensional
complexity of our transport equation that we resolve here
by scaling discharge by the 2-year flood (Q2)

giving the coefficient of the equation constant dimensions of
kg m1 s1. In our revised equation, the relationship between
b and supply-related armoring (q*) remains the same as that
of Barry et al. [2004]; however, the relationship between a
and drainage area (A) changed substantially. The coefficient
a represents the magnitude of bed load transport, which is a
function of basin-specific sediment supply and discharge,
both of which can be expressed as functions of drainage area.
In our earlier work [Barry et al., 2004] we proposed an
inverse relationship between a and drainage area because
discharge increases faster then sediment transport rate [Barry
et al., 2004, paragraph 51]. However, we hypothesize here
that a direct relationship exists between a and drainage area
when we scale discharge by the 2-year flow (Figure 1). This
scaling incorporates basin-specific differences in water yield,
causing the relationship between a and drainage area to be
solely a function of how sediment yield increases with
drainage area. We also find that equation (1) performs better
than the original equation in terms of predicting the observed
bed load transport rates at the 17 independent test sites
(Figure 2). However, the performance of (1) is not
statistically different from equation (6) of Barry et al.
[2004], nor is it statistically different from the performance of
the Ackers and White [1973] equation. Consequently, our
original assessments of formula performance remain un-
changed.
