ABSTRACT
We describe conditions for producing uninterrupted
expanded CTG repeats consisting of up to 2000
repeats using u29 DNA polymerase. Previously,
generation of such repeats was hindered by CTG
repeat instability in plasmid vectors maintained in
Escherichia coli and poor in vitro ligation of CTG
repeat concatemers due to strand slippage. Instead,
we used a combination of in vitro ligation and u29
DNA polymerase to amplify DNA. Correctly ligated
products generating a dimerized repeat tract
formed substrates for rolling circle amplification
(RCA). In the presence of two non-complementary
primers, hybridizing to either strand of DNA, liga-
tions can be amplified to generate microgram
quantities of repeat containing DNA. Additionally,
expanded repeats generated by rolling circle ampli-
fication can be produced in vectors for expression
of expanded CUG (CUGexp) RNA capable of seques-
tering MBNL1 protein in cell culture. Amplification of
dimerized expanded repeats (ADER) opens new
possibilities for studies of repeat instability and
pathogenesis in myotonic dystrophy, a neurological
disorder caused by an expanded CTG repeat.
INTRODUCTION
Microsatellite repeat expansions cause about 20 diﬀerent
neurological disorders (1,2). For a subset of these,
the causative mutation involves expansions of several
hundreds or thousands of repeats located in non-protein-
coding regions of the genome. This group of disorders
includes myotonic dystrophy, the most common form of
muscular dystrophy in adults. The more prevalent form of
myotonic dystrophy, type 1 (DM1), is caused by a CTG
repeat expansion in the 30 untranslated (UTR) region of
the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene.
While transgenic and cell culture models have been
generated, the repeat expansions are towards the lower
end of the disease range or it has been necessary to create
interruptions in the repeat sequence (3–7). It has been
diﬃcult to create models with larger uninterrupted repeats
owing to the technical diﬃculties associated with cloning
CTG repeat expansions. However, these models are
important for studies of repeat instability and disease
pathogenesis, particularly because the severity of DM1
correlates with repeat length (8). Also, perhaps more
importantly, larger repeat expansions of (CTG)500–2000 are
associated with a congenital-onset form of DM1 that has a
qualitatively diﬀerent phenotype (9).
Traditional methods for cloning expanded repeat tracts
have relied on plasmid vectors in E. coli. In the case of
CTG repeats, despite optimization of host and vector
combinations, the upper limit that can be maintained is
generally <300, owing to the propensity of E. coli to delete
repeat tracts [(10), however, see reference (11) for an
exception]. In vitro ligation of pure CTG repeats is also
ineﬃcient owing to strand slippage that changes the
overhangs at the ends of the DNA molecules (12). Despite
recent technical advances that yield greater ligation
eﬃciencies, it is still diﬃcult to generate ligation products
with >300 CTG repeats (12).
Previously RCA has been used to generate artiﬁcial
repetitive sequences from small circular DNA molecules
using E. coli DNA polymerase I (13). Herein we describe
an alternative strategy to generate highly expanded CTG
repeats by a combination of in vitro ligation and RCA
using u29 DNA polymerase to amplify DNA. This
enzyme has a low error rate, strong strand displacement
activity and high processivity. It provides an alternative
to cloning using E. coli vectors or PCR ampliﬁcation,
especially when the target sequence is repetitive (14,15).
RCA ampliﬁcation products are produced from circular
templates and contain many tandem copies of the starting
molecule. These tandem copies are then templates for
additional DNA synthesis producing a hyperbranched

ampliﬁcation product containing double-stranded DNA
(16). We found that CTG repeats are remarkably stable
during u29 DNA polymerase ampliﬁcation and have been
able to generate microgram quantities of DNA containing
(CTG)1920–2080 repeats, in the range of repeat expansions
that lead to congenital DM1.
METHODS
In vitro ligations and cloning
To create pHC120–130, the CTG repeat tract from pACT
[(CTG)120–130 cloned at the BbsI-BsaI sites in pACYC177]
was excised by BamHI and EcoRI, blunt ended and
ligated into the blunt cloning site in pSMART HCKan
(Lucigen, accession no AF532107). Plasmids were selected
with repeat tracts orientated so that the lagging strand
template encoded CAG repeats. pHC240–260 and pH480–520
were cloned by sequential dimerization reactions. For
dimerization reactions, vectors or ampliﬁcation products
were digested with BbsI-AlwNI. A second aliquot was
digested with BsaI-AlwNI. Fragments containing the
CTG repeat tract were gel puriﬁed from each digest
using the ZymocleanTM Gel DNA recovery kit (Zymo
Research) and ligated using 400 units of T4 DNA ligase in
1 ligase buﬀer [New England Biolabs (NEB), MA] at
room temperature for 1 h. When BbsI-AlwNI repeat and
non-repeat fragments were of similar length, we supple-
mented this digestion with PvuI. Vectors containing CTG
repeats were sequenced using primers SL1 50-CAGTCCA
GTTACGCTGGAGTC-30 or SR2 50-GGTCAGGTA
TGATTTAAATGGTCAGT-30 (Lucigen) to conﬁrm
that they contained uninterrupted CTG repeats. For
experiments using pHC without repeats, a NotI linker
was cloned at the blunt cloning site of pSMART HCKan.
Culture of repeat-containing vectors in E. coli
We used previously described conditions to culture
transformed HB101 E. coli to minimize instability of
expanded CTG repeats (12). Cells were grown in Luria–
Bertani broth supplemented with 10 mg/ml kanamycin at
308C, and cultures were harvested before stationary phase
(OD650 of 0.7).
u29 amplification reactions
A total of 100 ng or 150 ng of template DNA in dH2O and
100 pmoles of each exonuclease-resistant primer contain-
ing phosphothioate linkages () 50-GCGATTCCGACTC
GTCCAAC-30 and 50-AACGGGAAACGTCTTGCT
CG-30 in 10mM Tris, 0.1mM EDTA, pH 8.0 were heated
to 958C for 3min, and cooled to 48C in a thermocycler.
For dimerization of plasmid-derived template we typically
used 100 ng of template and for dimerization of RCA
products, where more template was available, 150 ng.
Template and primers were then added to a 30 ml reaction
containing 1mM each of the four dNTPs, 6 mg BSA,
1u29 buﬀer and 10 units of u29 DNA polymerase
(NEB). For control reactions template DNA was
substituted with dH2O or u29 DNA polymerase was
omitted. Reactions were incubated in a thermocycler at
378C for 18 h and then at 658C for 10min to heat
inactivate u29 DNA polymerase before storage at 48C.
Analysis of amplification reactions
For restriction endonuclease analysis, 1 ml of ampliﬁcation
product or 500 ng miniprep DNA was digested with
enzyme. One-half of each digest was analysed by electro-
phoresis on 1% SeaKem LE agarose gels (Cambrex Bio
Science, Rockland, ME) and visualized by staining with
ethidium bromide. For sequencing of RCA products, we
gel puriﬁed linearized ampliﬁcation products after restric-
tion digestion with AlwNI. To sequence across repeat
tracts we used primers SL1 and SR2. To sequence across
the AlwNI junction RCA products were ﬁrst digested with
XhoI, and then sequenced with 50-TTCTCCCTTCGG
GAAGCGTG-30.
DNA quantitation
DNA was mixed 1:1 with Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), which contains SYBR
Green I and internal ROX Reference Dye. Fluorescence
intensity was measured on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT
Sequence Detection System and normalized to internal
ROX Reference Dye. Fluorescent measurements were
compared to standard curves constructed using
UltraPureTM Salmon Sperm DNA Solution (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).
CUGexp expression construct
The vector for expression of CUGexp RNA was con-
structed by inserting a linker (50-GGCCACATGTC
CGAATGCTAGCCTGCAGATTCGAGGTAACCGG
TCCAAGATCT-30) at the NotI site of pHC and then
inserting the CMV IE promoter from pEGFP-C1
(Clontech) at PciI-NheI and a modiﬁed DMPK 30UTR
at PstI-BglII. The modiﬁed DMPK 30UTR contained non-
palindromic sequences for SﬁI and BsteII restriction
endonucleases inserted at the BsmI site. The SﬁI and
BsteII sites were separated by a 1.2-kb stuﬀer fragment
that allowed resolution of SﬁI-BsteII digested vector from
that digested with only one enzyme. We also replaced the
cleavage and polyadenylation signals from DMPK with
those from murine Acta1, because the native DMPK
signals are ineﬃcient (17). We then modiﬁed pHC120–130
by insertion of SﬁI and BsteII sites surrounding the BsaI
and BbsI sites to create pDWD120–130, and then dimerized
repeat tracts and maintained pDWD240–260 in E. coli. This
vector was then dimerized and sequential in vitro ligation
and RCA ampliﬁcations were used to generate
(CTG)960–1040 repeats. The repeats were ligated into the
expression vector using SﬁI and BsteII, ampliﬁed by RCA
and sequence conﬁrmed.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization and
immunofluorescence (FISH-IF)
HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 1.3 105 cells per
well into 6-well plates containing pre-sterilized coverslips.
Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1%
penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine

serum (Invitrogen). Cells were then transfected 24 h
after plating with 100 ng of gel-puriﬁed AlwNI linearized
RCA products using Fugene6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four
hours after transfection cells were washed twice with PBS
then ﬁxed in 3% paraformaldehyde PBS for 30min,
permeabilized in 0.5% Triton PBS for 5min and then
prehybridized in 30% formamide and 2 SSC at room
temperature for 10min. Next, cells were hybridized with
probe (0.2 ng/ml) for 2 h at 378C in buﬀer (30%
formamide, 2SSC, 0.02% BSA, 66 mg/ml yeast rRNA,
2mM vanadyl complex) and then washed for 30min in
30% formamide/2SSC at 428C followed by 1SSC for
30min at room temperature. The CAG-repeat probes
for FISH were HPLC puriﬁed 2-O-methyl oligoribonu-
cleotide 20-mers conjugated at the 30 end with Texas Red
(IDT, Coralville, IA). Cells were then incubated with
polyclonal anti-MBNL1 antibody in PBS (A2764 at
1:5000) (18) overnight at 48C, washed ﬁve times in PBS
for 2min, then incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa
488-labeled goat anti-rabbit polyclonal) and 33 nM
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 30min at room
temperature. Cells were washed ﬁve times in PBS prior to
mounting. Images were obtained on a Nikon Eclipse E600
microscope ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a
Photometrics Coolsnap HQ camera using Metaview
version 6.1r5 (Universal Imaging) software.
RESULTS
Critical factors aﬀecting CTGCAG repeat stability in
plasmid vectors include orienting the repeats relative to
the replication origin so that the lagging strand template
for DNA synthesis encodes CAG repeats (10) and
minimizing transcription through repeat sequences (19).
We therefore cloned (CTG)120–130 repeats in the stable
orientation using a vector that contains transcriptional
terminators (pSMART HCKan, Lucigen), to create
vector pHC120–130. We found that CTG repeats in vector
pHC120–130, or when dimerized to produce vector
pHC240–260, could be maintained in HB101 host cells, an
E. coli strain previously shown to reduce the frequency of
CTG repeat deletions (10). Consistent with previous
observations (10), larger repeat tracts, from dimerization
of pHC240–260, were not stable (data not shown). Given
the diﬃculty of maintaining larger CTG repeats in E. coli
we used a combination of in vitro ligation followed by
RCA to amplify the circularized ligation products
(Figure 1).
RCA reactions often rely on random hexamer primers
that contain phosphothioate linkages to prevent degrada-
tion by the 30–50 exonuclease activity of u29 DNA
polymerase. We avoided random hexamer primers
because of concerns that initiating DNA synthesis within
a CTGCAG repeat tract would produce repeat tracts
that contained phosphothioate linkages, with unknown
downstream eﬀects on transcription and repeat stability.
Instead, we used two non-complementary primers in a
hyperbranched-RCA reaction (16). In this reaction one
primer binds to circular DNA template and initiates an
RCA reaction. The other primer binds to each copy
generated by the rolling circle, initiating sequential
primer extension reactions (Figure 1). Because the circular
DNA template is generated by denaturation of double-
stranded vector DNA, either primer can initiate an RCA
reaction.
Initial experiments using the pHC vector without CTG
repeats were used to establish conditions for the RCA.
Using 100 ng of plasmid DNA as template we were able to
detect reaction product in an RCA reaction at 378C but
not at 308C (data not shown). Restriction endonuclease
digestions of ampliﬁcation products with XhoI or HindIII
yielded fragments at the expected size, but no products
were produced when template or u29 DNA polymerase
were omitted from the reaction (Figure 2A). We then used
RCA to amplify 100 ng of plasmid DNA prepared from a
vector containing CTG repeats, pHC120–130. Digestion of
ampliﬁcation products with XhoI, HindIII or Acc65I-
BsrGI veriﬁed that the repeats were not deleted during the
RCA reaction (Figure 2B). Digestions also yielded some
minor bands which correspond in size to digested
ampliﬁcation products that terminate at one of the
primers used for RCA. We conﬁrmed that the
(CTG)120–130 repeats were faithfully copied by sequencing
plasmid DNA and ampliﬁcation products. These
sequencing reads included the entire CTG repeat tract,
conﬁrming that the plasmid DNA template and duplicate
RCA products contained the same number (n=124) of
uninterrupted repeats.
To dimerize CTG repeats we used an approach similar
to previously described methods for seamless cloning
of CTG repeats (3,20). Two type II restriction endonu-
cleases (BbsI and BsaI) ﬂanked the CTG repeat tract in
pHC120–130. These enzymes cut outside their recognition
site and within the repeat tract to generate complemen-
tary overhangs (50-AGCA-30 or 50-TGCT-30). Religation
of these overhangs creates an uninterrupted CTG repeat.
pHC120–130 was digested with BbsI and AlwNI or with
BsaI and AlwNI. The repeat-containing fragments

DNA is digested by BbsI-AlwNI and BsaI-AlwNI. In step 2, the repeat
containing fragments are gel puriﬁed and ligated to generate a circular
double-stranded (ds) DNA template with an uninterrupted dimerized
repeat tract. In step 3, dsDNA template is denatured and primers are
annealed. Template DNA is then ampliﬁed by RCA generating
hyperbranched DNA that can be used to initiate the next cycle of
repeat dimerization.

from both digests were isolated, as shown in Figure 1.
All overhangs in these fragments are non-palindromic,
therefore their ligation can generate only one circular
product or concatemers of this product. The circular
product contains an uninterrupted dimerized repeat tract
and a reconstituted vector backbone (Figure 1).
We determined that the ligation reaction generated
uninterrupted repeats by sequencing eight pHC240–260
clones maintained in E. coli. Sequencing reads obtained
from either end of the repeat tract extended across the
ligation junction [(CTG)>145], conﬁrming that BbsI and
BsaI have generated the expected overhangs and that
ligation of these fragments maintains an uninterrupted
CTG repeat.
We next sought to determine whether we could amplify
DNA from a ligation reaction containing a larger
repeat tract. We ﬁrst dimerized the repeat tract in vector
pHC240–260 and then used RCA to amplify the ligation
reaction. Analysis of ampliﬁcation products with restric-
tion endonucleases veriﬁed that the size of the repeat
tract was consistent with a dimerized repeat containing
(CTG)480–520 (Figure 3A). For duplicate reactions,
we sequence veriﬁed >290 repeats from either end of the
repeats, again conﬁrming that the ligation junction within
the repeats formed an uninterrupted repeat tract. We
then used sequential ligation and RCA reactions to
generate increasingly expanded CTG repeat tracts with
(CTG)960–1040 and (CTG)1920–2080. After RCA we quanti-
ﬁed double-stranded DNA using SYBR Green I
ﬂuorescence, and found that in each case (n=4) ligation
reactions were ampliﬁed by more than 1000-fold to
generate >180 mg of product DNA containing
(CTG)960–1040 or (CTG)1920–2080 in a single reaction.
Both (CTG)960–1040 and (CTG)1920–2080 products were
analysed by restriction endonuclease digestion
(Figure 3B), sequencing from either end of the repeats,
and sequencing across the AlwNI junction. Both of these
RCA reactions generated additional minor products with
undimerized repeat tracts. These products were obtained
in multiple reactions and probably occurred because
incompletely digested template was included in the
ligation reactions. The most likely source of this template
was from failure to resolve BsaI-AlwNI repeat containing
fragments from those digested with only one enzyme.

in the absence of template (lane 4) or u29 DNA polymerase (lane 5). RCA products from duplicate reactions containing template and u29 DNA
polymerase migrated as high molecular weight DNA (lanes 6 and 7), slower than the largest marker DNA (10 kb). Restriction endonuclease digest of

BsrGI cleave on either side of the repeat tract. RCA products were observed from duplicate reactions containing both template and u29 polymerase
(lanes 7 and 8) but not in the absence of template (lane 5) or u29 polymerase (lane 6). Restriction endonuclease digest of duplicate RCA products
using XhoI (lanes 9 and 12), HindIII (lanes 10 and 13) or Acc65I-BsrGI (lanes 11 and 14) generated the same pattern as plasmid pHC120–130.
Fragments containing repeats are marked with arrows. Lanes 1 and 15 contain 1 kb DNA ladder (NEB).

Expression of RNA containing expanded CUG repeats
in DM1 results in the sequestration of splicing factors in
the muscleblind (MBNL) family (21,22). To determine
whether DNA generated by RCA would support the
synthesis of expanded CUG repeats in cells, we ligated
(CTG)960–1040 repeats into an expression vector, ampliﬁed
the ligation products by RCA, linearized the RCA
product, and transfected the resultant DNA into
HEK293 cells. In situ hybridization using a ﬂuorescent-
labeled CAG repeat probe showed nuclear foci of CUGexp
RNA in cells transfected with RCA product, but not in
mock-transfected controls. To determine whether
MBNL1 was recruited to nuclear RNA foci we combined
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using CAG
repeat probes with MBNL1 immunoﬂuorescence. In
mock-transfected cells no foci were present and MBNL1
was diﬀusely distributed in nuclei, whereas in cells
transfected with RCA products MBNL1 was recruited
into RNA foci (Figure 4). Foci were not observed on
hybridization with CUG-(sense) or GUC-repeat probes
(data not shown), making it unlikely that foci were the
result of probe binding to nuclear proteins or DNA.
DISCUSSION
Generation of expanded DNA tracts of > 300 CTG
repeats is an important goal for the development of new
models of repeat instability and pathogenesis for DM1.
So far these studies have been hampered by the diﬃculty
of maintaining > 300 CTG repeats in E. coli and the
ineﬃcient ligation of CTG repeat concatemers in vitro
(10,12). Here we described ADER, a cell-free method for
generating hyperexpanded CTG repeats that involves
rolling circle ampliﬁcation of in vitro ligated CTG repeats.
ADER has several advantages over traditional methods;
(i) unlike cloning in E. coli, RCA does not delete CTG
repeats; (ii) doubling in size of the CTG repeat can be
easily monitored at each step; (iii) suﬃcient DNA is
synthesized to allow sequence veriﬁcation of ampliﬁcation
products and other downstream applications; and
(iv) expanded repeats can be produced in vectors for
expression of CUGexp RNA.
CTG repeats can form non-classical slipped-strand
DNA structures, such as hairpins, which can be bypassed
by the DNA replication machinery and thus deleted (23).

generated a linear 2554–2614 bp fragment with XhoI (lane 2), 1529–1589 bp and 1025 bp fragments with HindIII (lane 3), and 739–799 bp and
1815 bp fragments with Acc65I-BsrGI (lane 4). Ligation reactions containing pHC240–260 with a dimerized CTG repeat were used as template for
RCA. No ampliﬁcation was observed in the absence of template (lane 5) or 29 DNA polymerase (lane 6), but products were obtained from
duplicate reactions containing both template and 29 DNA polymerase (lanes 7 and 8). Restriction endonuclease digest of duplicate ampliﬁcation
products using XhoI (lanes 9 and 12), HindIII (lanes 10 and 13) or Acc65I-BsrGI (lanes 11 and 14) generated a vector backbone at the same size as
for pHC240–260 and a dimerized repeat tract containing (CTG)480–520. Fragments containing repeats are marked with arrows. Lanes 1 and 15 contain
1 kb DNA ladder (NEB). (B) RCA product containing (CTG)480–520 was dimerized and then ampliﬁed by RCA. Restriction endonuclease digests
using XhoI (lanes 2 and 5), HindIII (lanes 3 and 6) and BsrGI-Acc65I (lanes 4 and 7) on duplicate RCA reactions containing (CTG)960–1040 showed
expected fragment sizes. RCA product containing (CTG)960–1040 was dimerized and then ampliﬁed by RCA. Digests of duplicate RCA product using
XhoI (lanes 8 and 11), HindIII (lanes 9 and 12) and BsrGI-Acc65I (lanes 10 and 13) showed expected fragment sizes for (CTG)1920–2080. For the
(CTG)960–1040 and (CTG)1920–2080 reactions additional minor products corresponding in size to undimerized repeats were generated. Fragments
containing repeats are marked with arrows. Lanes 1 and 14 contain 1 kb DNA ladder (NEB).

The accurate copying of expanded CTG repeats is not
essential for u29 replication, since the largest CTG repeat
in the u29 genome is (CTG)2. The u29 DNA polymerase
has intrinsic strand displacement activity which allows it
to replicate DNA in the absence of processivity factors
and DNA helicases (14). The crystal structure of u29
DNA polymerase suggests that the downstream DNA
template passes through a tunnel before entering the active
site (24). The narrow dimensions of the tunnel (<10 A˚
long and 10 A˚ in diameter) make it too small to
accommodate double-stranded DNA and require the
separation of template and non-template strands. It is
possible that the tunnel separates non-classical slipped-
strand DNA structures before they enter the active site of
the DNA polymerase. This mechanism would prevent
bypassing of intramolecular hairpin structures by u29
DNA polymerase and would thus allow accurate copying
of CTG repeats. Intriguingly, this mechanism may also
allow u29 DNA polymerase to accurately copy
other repeats, such as trinucleotide (CGGCCG,
GAATTC), tetrameric (CCTGCAGG), pentameric
(AATCTAGATT), hexameric (TTAGGGCCCTAA)
and dodecameric (C4GC4GCGCGCG4CG4) repeats
involved in neurological disease (1,2) or telomere length
maintenance (25,26).

Fluorescence-labeled CAG repeat probe shows RNA foci (red) in
cells transfected with RCA products (top-left) but not mock-transfected
cells (bottom-left). Immunoﬂuorescence for MBNL1 (green) shows
nuclear foci in cells transfected with RCA products (top-middle) and
a speckled distribution of MBNL1 in mock-transfected cells
(bottom-middle). Merged images show nuclear foci of RNA and
MBNL1 are colocalized in nuclei (blue) of cells transfected with RCA
products (top-right) but not in mock-transfected cells (bottom-right).
Ribonuclear foci were observed in 5% of cells, consistent with low
eﬃciency from transfection of linear DNA (27).
