Abstract: Visuomotor processing is selective — only a small subset of stimuli that impinge on the retinae reach
perceptual awareness and/or elicit behavioral responses. Both binocular rivalry and attention involve visual selection,
but aﬀect perception quite diﬀerently. During rivalry, awareness alternates between diﬀerent stimuli presented to the
two eyes. In contrast, attending to one of the two stimuli impairs discrimination of the ignored stimulus, but without
causing it to perceptually disappear. We review experiments demonstrating that, despite their phenomenological
diﬀerences, attention and rivalry depend upon shared competitive selection mechanisms. These experiments, moreover,
reveal stimulus selection that is surface-based and requires coordination between the diﬀerent neuronal populations
that respond as a surface changes its attributes (type of motion) over time. This surface-based selection, in turn biases
interocular competition, favoring the eye whose image is consistent with the selected surface. The review ends
with speculation about the role of the thalamus in mediating this dynamic coordination, as well as thoughts about what
underlies the diﬀerences in the phenomenology of selective attention and rivalry.
Introduction
Lesion studies in monkeys have found evidence that
extrastriate cortex plays a key role in visual selection.
Lesions of MT (the medial temporal area) or V4 cause
only relatively mild impairments in basic sensory
processing such as contrast sensitivity, wavelength
and brightness discrimination, form vision, orienta-
tion discrimination, motion, flicker perception, and
stereopsis. In contrast, these lesions cause a profound
deficit in the ability to discriminate features of a target
stimulus when it is presented among salient distrac-
tors (Schiller, 1993; De Weerd et al., 1999). Lesions of
Area TEO likewise cause only minor impairments
in orientation discrimination, except when the
discriminandum is presented with more salient dis-
tractors (De Weerd et al., 1999).
Single unit recording studies in the monkey have
provided important mechanistic insights into the
role of extrastriate cortex in selecting targets from
among distractors. Neuronal recordings made in
Areas MT and V4 have found that the response
evoked by a preferred stimulus placed within the
classical receptive field (CRF) is typically suppressed
by the addition of a second poor stimulus within the
CRF (Snowden et al., 1991; Recanzone and Wurtz,
1997). These pair responses typically correspond to
an average of the responses to the preferred and poor
stimuli presented individually and are consistent
with competitive neuronal interactions (Reynolds
and Chelazzi, 2004). Studies in V4 (Reynolds et al.,
1999; Reynolds and Desimone, 2003) and MT
(Recanzone and Wurtz, 1999) suggested a relation-
ship between these competitive interactions and*Corresonding author. Tel.: þ1-858-453-4100;

selective attention. These studies looked at the con-
sequence of placing both a poor and a preferred
stimulus within the CRF when attention was directed
away from the CRF. Consistent with earlier studies,
responses evoked by the preferred stimulus were
suppressed by the addition of the poor stimulus
even when the latter was excitatory when presented
alone. The magnitude of this suppression was found
to be determined by the neuron’s selectivity for
the two stimuli, such that a very poor stimulus is
typically more suppressive than a stimulus that elicits
an intermediate response. The relationship between
the changes in firing rate associated with selective
attention and these competitive interactions was
studied next. It was found that directing attention
to the poor stimulus magnified its suppressive
effect, whereas directing attention to the preferred
stimulus reduced the suppressive effect of the ignored
poor stimulus. These pair responses approximate
a weighted average of the responses to the stimuli
presented individually. These patterns of neuronal
responses are consistent with a model of selective
attention in which feedback signals from areas such
as the frontal eye fields (Moore and Fallah, 2001;
Moore and Armstrong, 2003) bias competitive cir-
cuitry intrinsic to the visual cortex.
If different stimuli are presented to the two eyes,
binocular rivalry usually results — only one of the
two stimuli is perceived at any given time. Binocular
rivalry involves visual selection of a qualitatively
different sort than that observed during selective
attention in which attending to one of the two stimuli
does not render the unattended stimulus invisible.
Despite this important phenomenological difference,
there is reason to think that attention and rivalry
may depend on common stimulus selection mecha-
nisms (Lumer et al., 1998; Leopold and Logothetis,
1999), an idea that has been debated as far back as
the late 19th century (James, 1890; Helmholtz, 1909).
There are neurophysiological data supporting this
view. Single-unit recording studies of binocular
rivalry suggest that neuronal suppression becomes
more strongly correlated with perceptual suppres-
sion as one moves from V1 to IT (Sheinberg and
Logothetis, 1997; Logothetis, 1998). A similar trend
can be seen in attention, where attended stimuli
gain increased influence over neuronal responses as
one moves from early to later stages of processing
(Motter, 1993; Chelazzi et al., 1993; Reynolds et al.,
1999; Sheinberg and Logothetis, 2001). Thus, selec-
tion during attention, as well as during rivalry,
appears to depend on competitive interactions occur-
ring at multiple stages with progressively greater
accumulated effect as one ascends the cortical hier-
archy. This neurophysiological commonality suggests
a potential relationship between selective attention
and binocular rivalry.
What is selected: features, locations, eyes,
or surfaces?
Another connection between binocular rivalry and
selective attention is that the question of exactly
what is selected has been the subject of debate in
both domains. The attention studies discussed above
used spatially separated stimuli that were defined
by different features (e.g., upward vs. downward
motion). Therefore, it is not possible to say whether
the competitive mechanisms examined mediate selec-
tion of a spatial location, a specific feature, or the
object that occupies the attended location. However,
while it is well established in the attention literature
that spatial locations (Posner, 1980; Treisman and
Gelade, 1980) and single features (Saenz et al., 2002)
can be selected for preferential processing, it is now
recognized that an object or surface can also be
selected (Duncan, 1984; He and Nakayama, 1995).
For example, Blaser et al. (2000) found that observers
were able to track the color, orientation or spatial
frequency of one grating when another grating was
spatially superimposed. They found that tracking
two features of one grating was no more difficult
than tracking one feature, suggesting that attention
selects the whole stimulus. Tracking two similar
features of different gratings was markedly more
difficult, suggesting that selecting one stimulus
impaired selection of the other stimulus. In the
rivalry literature, the debate over what is selected
has centered on whether rivalry reflects competition
between stimulus representations (stimulus-based riv-
alry), interocular competition (eye-based rivalry), or
some combination of the two (Blake and Logothetis,
2002). The latter view, consistent with the neurophy-
siological findings discussed above, implies that inter-
ocular competition within area V1 and feature-based
228
competition within extrastriate cortex both contribute
to binocular rivalry. This view remains controversial,
however, as functional imaging studies suggest that
inter-ocular competition within area V1 may be
sufficient to account for the perceptual suppression
occurring during binocular rivalry (Tong and Engel,
2001, Polonsky et al., 2000).
Recent psychophysical studies have shown that
attention can select surfaces or objects (Valdes-Sosa
et al., 2000; Pinilla et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 2003;
Reynolds et al., 2003). These studies have ruled out
spatial selection by using spatially superimposed dot
fields and have ruled out attention to a single feature
by having the dot fields abruptly change from
rotation to translation in a random direction. This
approach has been adapted to determine whether
binocular rivalry and attention shared a surface-based
selection mechanism (Mitchell et al., 2004). This
paradigm is illustrated in Fig. 1. Observers viewed
rigid patterns of dots presented to both eyes at the
start of each trial. The dot patterns rotated in
opposite directions around the fixation point, yielding
a percept of two superimposed transparent surfaces.
After a period of dual rotation, one of the surfaces
underwent a brief translation in one of eight direc-
tions, and the observer discriminated its direction
of motion. This brief translation has previously been
found to have a cueing effect such that the trans-
lated surface has a temporary perceptual advantage
(Valdes-Sosa et al., 2000; Pinilla et al., 2001; Mitchell
et al., 2003; Reynolds et al., 2003). Accordingly, the
surface that underwent translation is referred to as the
cued surface. Following this translation, the cued
surface was removed from one eye and the uncued
surface was removed from the other eye. This dichop-
tic condition yielded a rivalrous percept. To deter-
mine whether the cued surface was dominant during
rivalry, observers were asked to report whether one
surface was clearly dominant at the end of dichoptic
presentation, and if so, which surface. By varying
the duration of dichoptic presentation from trial to
trial, the time course of dominance from 0–1850 ms
was traced.
As illustrated in Fig. 2A, for a brief time after
the switch to dichoptic presentation, neither surface
clearly dominated, consistent with previous mea-
sures of the time for perceptual dominance to
develop during rivalry (Wolfe, 1986; de Belsunce
and Sireteanu, 1991; Leonards and Sireteanu, 1993).
However, after 300 ms of dichoptic viewing, rivalry
was perceived on 70% of the trials, and the cued
surface was usually dominant. The translation
that cued attention was presented equally to
both eyes. Nonetheless, the translating surface was
dominant, irrespective of whether it appeared in the
right or left eye during subsequent dichoptic
viewing. Thus, the dominance of the cued surface
did not result directly from a bias of interocular
competition.
Rather, it appears as though the visual system
selected the translating surface and suppressed the
other surface. If so, observers should be impaired
in making judgments of the suppressed surface.
Observers had to perform a double translation task,
in which they reported the direction of a second
translation that occurred during rivalry. As before,
150 ms after the first translation, one surface from
each eye was deleted, but instead of asking observers
to report which surface was then dominant, they
were asked to report the direction of the second trans-
lation. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, observers were
impaired in judging the uncued surface during rivalry.
This impairment was weak but significant (two-
tailed t-test, p<0.05) immediately after the onset of
dichoptic viewing, agreeing with the relatively weak
perceptual dominance found following the shortest
period of dichoptic viewing (Fig. 2A). Observers
were strongly impaired at judging translations of the
uncued surface at longer dichoptic presentation times,
when they had reported that the cued surface was
dominant. Note that this impairment was surface-
and not merely feature-dependent: the identical
translation (e.g., an upward translation) was either
reported accurately or not, depending only on which
surface had previously translated. Thus, a surface-
based cue during binocular viewing determined which
surface would be judged accurately during subse-
quent rivalry, and this cueing effect had a timecourse
that matched that of perceptual dominance.
A simple modification of the stimulus enabled the
study to directly compare the impairments observed
during attention and rivalry. In the double translation
task, trials in which the stimuli were perceived as
superimposed transparent surfaces were interleaved
throughout the trial. On half of these transparency
trials, both surfaces were presented to both eyes
229
throughout the trial, a condition that would be refer-
red to as binocular transparency. On the other half
of the transparency trials, both surfaces were deleted
from one eye 150 ms after the first translation. This
monocular transparency condition controlled for the
momentary disruption caused by deleting surfaces
in the switch from normal binocular viewing to
rivalrous viewing, but without actually inducing
rivalry, as there was no competing stimulus in the
other eye. Despite this transient event, when switching
to monocular transparency there were no significant
differences in observers’ performance on mono-
cular and binocular transparency trials. Therefore,
we focus on monocular transparency, as it provides
a more direct comparison to rivalry.
As illustrated in Fig. 2C observers were impaired
in judging the uncued surface during monocular
transparency, but with a different timecourse than

in rivalry. The impairment was strongest 150 ms
after the first translation and disappeared within
1000 ms. In contrast, the peak impairment in rivalry
was delayed until 450 ms after the first translation,
and the impairment persisted even for the longest
period tested. This difference in the size of the
impairment and its timecourse was highly statistically
significant.
Discussion
These experiments provide the first evidence that
surface-based attention influences selection during
binocular rivalry. Presenting the first translation
binocularly ensures that dominance could not result
directly from biasing interocular competition. Rather,
the translation during transparency caused a surface
to be selected and to emerge as dominant during
subsequent dichoptic viewing. This selection was
not feature based — the translation cue impaired
direction-of-motion judgments of the non-dominant
surface during rivalry but not of the dominant
surface. This surface-specific impairment during
rivalry followed the same timecourse as that seen
for the dominance judgments. These results thus
extend the notion of stimulus-based rivalry (Diaz-
Caneja, 1928; Whittle et al., 1968; Kulikowski, 1992;
Kovacs et al., 1996; Logothetis et al., 1996; Alais and
Blake, 1998; Alais and Blake, 1999; Lee and Blake,
1999) to include surface-based rivalry.
The fact that a surface-based cue presented
during binocular viewing determines the surface that
will be judged accurately during both rivalry and

transparent surface perception supports the view
that, despite their obvious phenomenological differ-
ences, rivalry and attention rely on a partially over-
lapping set of competitive mechanisms. Evidence
for stimulus-based competition has been used to
argue that binocular rivalry falls within the general
class of multistable percepts that also includes the
Necker cube, the face–vase illusion, bistable cylinders
and other stimuli that alternate between compe-
ting interpretations in the absence of inter-ocular
differences (Logothetis, 1998; Dodd et al., 2001).
The present results thus raise the intriguing possibi-
lity that the selection of ambiguous or conflicting
stimulus interpretations (as with bistable percepts)
and the selection of one of several possibly rele-
vant stimuli (during selective attention) reflect the
operation of an overlapping set of competitive
mechanisms.
How do competitive mechanisms interact?
Neurons selective for rotation, translation, and eye-
of-origin reside, for the most part, in different cortical
areas. Thus, although neurons selective for direction
of translation are found in various cortical areas,
there are several lines of evidence that demonstrate
the importance of area MT in the recovery of direct-
ion of object motion especially, as reviewed above, in
the presence of multiple stimuli. Neurons selective for
direction of rotation conversely are found in MST
but rarely in MT (e.g., Lagae et al., 1994). Neurons
with strong ocular biases are found exclusively in area
V1. Given these cortical specializations, the continued
dominance of a surface as it sequentially activates
rotation-selective neurons and translation-selective
neurons would seem to require that different neuronal
populations in areas MT and MST communicate
the identity of the dominant surface to one another as
first one and then another become selectively acti-
vated. Likewise, the continued dominance of the
cued surface after the transition to rivalrous viewing
suggests that the motions encoded in areas MST and
MT are somehow linked, in a surface-specific manner,
with V1 neurons selective for eye-of-origin. Neither
the mechanisms nor the neuronal pathways that sub-
serve this linkage are known.
Possible role of the thalamus
Direct corticocortical connections offer one possibil-
ity (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991) but the cortico-
pulvinar-cortical pathways (Sherman and Guillery,
2003) offer an alternative. There are several intriguing
lines of evidence that suggest a possible role for
the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus in surface based
selection. First, pulvinar lesions in humans have been
found to result in an inability to correctly conjoin
features (Ward et al., 2002). Second, lesions of
the pulvinar also result in deficits in selective attention
(e.g., Danziger et al., 2004; Michael and Desmedt,
2004). Third, there is evidence that the diffusely
projecting neurons of the thalamus may be involved
in synchronizing neuronal activity across different
cortical areas (Jones, 2001, 2002). The functional
importance of synchrony is controversial but has been
implicated in both selective attention (Fries et al.,
2001) and feature binding (e.g., Castelo-Branco et al.,
2000, Thiele and Stoner, 2003). Fourth, the different
firing modes of thalamic relay cells (burst and tonic)
may underlie selective processing of stimuli, with
bursting associated with shifts of attention and tonic
firing associated with continued scrutiny (Sherman
and Guillery, 2003). These various lines of evidence,
taken together, suggest the (admittedly highly spec-
ulative) idea that the thalamus may play a critical role
in surface-based selection.
What accounts for differing phenomenology
of attention and rivalry?
The double translation experiments isolated the con-
tribution of neurons that mediate inter-ocular com-
petition. Transparency and dichoptic viewing trials
began identically, with one of the two surfaces cued
by a sudden translation. Stimulus conditions were
identical during cueing, so the same neurons logi-
cally must have been engaged, regardless of whether
transparent or rivalrous viewing ensued. From this, it
is surmised that the same object-based mechanisms
initiated selection for both transparency and rivalry
trials. However, after the cueing phase, the sole dif-
ference between the rivalry and monocular trans-
parency conditions was that the two deleted stimuli
232
were removed from different eyes in one condition
and from a single eye in the other. Thus, whereas
dominance during rivalry and transparency must
have been triggered by the same object-based mecha-
nisms, the differences in the timecourses of selection
and phenomenology can only be due to neurons with
eye-of-origin information.
As neurons with strong selectivity for eye-of-origin
are found in V1, these differences plausibly are due
to the involvement of V1. One way of reconciling
the evidence that binocular rivalry depends upon
interocular competition with the evidence implying
competition at multiple interacting stages is to assume
that interocular competition within V1 underlies the
complete perceptual suppression associated with
binocular rivalry, but that which eye’s input is
dominant can be influenced by input from competi-
tive mechanisms within extrastriate areas. If area
V1 does indeed play a special role in perceptual
suppression during rivalry, it may be because of
its unique placement in the cortical hierarchy or per-
haps because interocular competition is stronger than
feature- and surface-based competition and hence
leads to a winner-take-all selection.
