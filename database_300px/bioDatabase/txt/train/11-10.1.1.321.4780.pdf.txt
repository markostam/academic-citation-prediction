ABSTRACT
Abasic (AP)-endonuclease (APE) is responsible for
repair of AP sites, and single-strand DNA breaks
with 30 blocking groups that are generated either
spontaneously or during repair of damaged or abnor-
mal bases via the DNA base excision repair (BER)
pathway in both nucleus and mitochondria. Mamma-
lian cells express only one nuclear APE, 36 kDa APE1,
which is essential for survival. Mammalian mitoc-
hondrial (mt) BER enzymes other than mtAPE have
been characterized. In order to identify and chara-
cterize mtAPE, we purified the APE activity from
beef liver mitochondria to near homogeneity, and
showed that the mtAPE which has 3-fold higher
specific activity relative to APE1 is derived from the
latter with deletion of 33 N-terminal residues which
contain the nuclear localization signal. The mtAPE-
sized product could be generated by incubating
35S-labeled APE1 with crude mitochondrial extract,
but not with cytosolic or nuclear extract, suggesting
that cleavage of APE1 by a specific mitochondria-
associated N-terminal peptidase is a prerequisite
for mitochondrial import. The low abundance of
mtAPE, particularly in cultured cells might be the
reason for its earlier lack of detection by western
analysis.
INTRODUCTION
ROS-induced damage in DNA includes a plethora of oxidized
bases, abasic (AP) sites and DNA strand breaks all of which
are repaired via the base excision repair (BER) pathway.
Repair of damaged bases is initiated with excision of a
damaged or abnormal base by a DNA glycosylase thereby
leaving a non-coding AP site. Oxidized base-specific mam-
malian DNA glycosylases, such as NTH1 and OGG1 further
cleave the AP site via lyase reaction to generate 30 a, b unsat-
urated deoxyribose (1). ROS also directly attacks deoxyribose
and cleaves the DNA strand to produce 30-glycolate termini
(2,3). Both AP sites and 30 blocking groups are processed by
abasic (AP)-endonuclease (APE) to generate a 30 OH terminus
which serves as the primer for gap-filling DNA synthesis by
a DNA polymerase. All APEs have both AP site-specific
endonuclease and 30 phosphodiesterase activities (4). Unlike
Escherichia coli or yeast, mammalian cells express only one
APE, 36 kDa APE1, whose sequence is highly conserved
among various mammalian species. The human and bovine
APE1s have 93% sequence identity. APE1 belongs to the
E.coli Xth family and has significant homology with APN2
in yeast (4–6).
The mitochondrial genome is much more susceptible to
endogenous, oxidative damage than the nuclear genome
presumably because of both proximity to the site of ROS
generation (in mitochondrial respiratory complexes), and the
lack of associated histones (7,8). Oxidative damage to the
mitochondrial genome has been implicated in various human
degenerative diseases, and in aging (9,10). DNA repair in
mitochondria should thus be extremely important, particu-
larly for non-dividing cells (11). Although the mitochondria
lack the nucleotide excision repair system (12), repair of
oxidative damage via the BER pathway in the mitochondria
has been demonstrated for a number of cell types (13–19).
Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is the first DNA glycosylase
to be identified in mitochondria (20,21). Nuclear and
mitochondria-specific DNA glycosylases are encoded by
the same nuclear genes. These mitochondrial enzymes lack
the nuclear localization signal (NLS), and contain N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) (22–24).

While most BER enzymes in mitochondria have been char-
acterized, the nature of mtAPE remains unclear. APE activity,
which was believed to be due to APE1, was demonstrated in
Xenopus oocyte mitochondria (13). Tell et al. (25) showed
APE1’s localization in rat cell mitochondria. Because APE1
does not appear to possess N-terminal MTS, the targeting of
APE1 to the mitochondria was difficult to explain, although
APE1 was suggested to diffuse through the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore in oxidatively stressed cells
(26,27).
The presence of APE activity in mouse cell mitochondria
was first demonstrated by Tomkinson et al. (28) who partially
purified the enzyme, and observed APE1 antibody cross-
reacting 66–68 kDa bands. However, these larger proteins
were not further characterized. Subsequently a homolog of
APE1, named APE2, was identified in the human genome
database which encodes a 62 kDa protein (29). Although
APE2 with putative MTS was shown to be present in both
the nucleus and mitochondria, it has no detectable APE
activity (29,30).
One problem in studying mitochondrial proteins, not
appreciated earlier, is the difficulty of removing endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and cytosolic contaminants from purified mito-
chondria (31). Some proteins, originally shown to be present in
the mitochondrial matrix, could in fact be adventitiously asso-
ciated with the mitochondrial outer membrane and ER (32).
However, such extraneous proteins are susceptible to trypsin
which does not degrade the matrix proteins (33).
Because of the uncertainty about the nature of mtAPE, we
decided to identify the mammalian mtAPE by purifying the
enzyme, based on activity. We have shown here that mtAPE is
derived from APE1 by proteolytic cleavage of 33 N-terminal
residues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Purification of mitochondria
Mitochondria from beef liver (4 lbs) were purified by frac-
tionating cell lysate via differential centrifugation with slight
modification of a published procedure (20). The mitochondrial
pellet was resuspended in 50 ml buffer A (10 mM HEPES–
KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EGTA
and 2 m EDTA). The final purification step involved centri-
fugation in sucrose step gradient containing 1 and 1.5 M
sucrose in 10 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.4) and 1 mM
EDTA. The mitochondria were harvested from the sucrose
band interphase, washed twice with buffer A, and then
lysed with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES–KOH
(pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 300 mM KCl, 5%
glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 0.5% Triton
X-100. The lysate was centrifuged in a microfuge for 15 min,
and the supernatant was stored at 80C.
Trypsin treatment of mitochondria
Intact mitochondria from beef liver or mouse NIH3T3 cells
(1 mg/ml) resuspended in buffer A were treated with trypsin
(10 mg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by the
addition of an equivalent amount of bovine trypsin inhibitor
(Invitrogen) to inactivate the trypsin (33,34). Protease and
mock-treated mitochondrial suspensions were washed twice
in the same buffer before lysis.
Purification of mitochondrial APE from beef liver
The mitochondrial lysates were dialyzed against buffer B
containing 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl 0.1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol at 4C for 3 h to remove
Triton X-100, and then loaded on 50 ml HiTrap Q and
SP–Sepharose columns (Amersham) connected in tandem.
After washing with buffer B, the HiTrap-SP column was dis-
connected, from which the proteins were eluted with buffer B
containing a linear gradient of KCl (0.05–1.0 M). Fractions
with high-APE activity were pooled, dialyzed and then loaded
onto a 5 ml HiTrap SP column. After washing, a 40 ml linear
gradient of KCl (0.1–0.6 M) in buffer B was used, and the APE
activity was eluted at 250–270 mM KCl. The pooled active
fractions were similarly processed twice more using a 1 ml
HiTrap-SP column. The peak activity present in two fractions
from the last column was further purified by chromatography
on a 1 ml HiTrap-Heparin column, using a 0.1–0.6 M KCl
gradient. APE-containing fractions were pooled, snap-frozen
and stored at 80C.
Mass spectrometry and peptide sequence analysis
Protein bands in SDS–PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue
were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin and then
analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems) for identi-
fication. The proteins were also independently identified by
automated N-terminal sequencing after transferring to PVDF
membrane.
Expression and purification of full-length and ND33
recombinant human APE1
The coding sequence for full-length human APE1 (hAPE1)
was inserted in the pET15b vector (Novagen) at NdeI/XhoI
sites for expression of APE1 in E.coli. The ND33 hAPE1
mutant, lacking 33 N-terminal residues, was similarly exp-
ressed using the same vector. Both plasmids encoded 20 addi-
tional amino acid residues including His6 sequence tag at the
N-terminus. E.coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the
APE1 plasmid were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D-
thiogalactopyranoside at 0.6 A600 and then grown at 16
C
overnight. After harvesting and then resuspending the bacteria
in buffer C (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.5 M NaCl), the
cells were sonicated, filtered and then applied to a 3 ml Ni-NTA
Superflow (Qiagen) column. After washing successively with
30 ml of buffer C and then 30 ml buffer C containing 40 mM
imidazole, APE1 was eluted in 1 ml fractions with 10 ml
buffer C containing 100 mM imidazole. After pooling active
fractions and dialysis in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT and
10% glycerol, the solution was treated with thrombin (10 U)
before SP-Sepharose chromatography. APE1 was eluted with
a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1–0.6 M) in the previous buffer.
Thrombin removed all but two additional N-terminal residues
in APE1 or ND33 APE1. The active fractions of both enzymes
were stored at 20C in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 50%
glycerol.

AP-endonuclease assay
A 43mer oligo duplex containing tetrahydrofuran (THF;
Midland) at position 31 in the sequence 50-GATCTGAT-
TCCCCATCTCCTCAGTTTCACTXCTGCACCGCATG-30
(X: THF) was 50-terminally labeled using [g-32P]ATP and T4
polynucleotide kinase (PNK). After annealing to the comple-
mentary strand with A opposite THF and subsequent purifica-
tion by PAGE, the duplex oligo (500 nM) was incubated with
mitochondrial fractions or recombinant APE1 at 37C for
10 min in a 10 ml reaction mixture containing 50 mM KCl,
2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA and 100 mg/ml
BSA at pH 9.2 (50 mM AMPSO) or at pH 7.5 (50 mM
Tris–HCl). After stopping the reaction with 80% formam-
ide/10 mM NaOH containing 0.05% xylene cyanol, the oligos
were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis in 20%
polyacrylamide containing 8 M urea. Radioactivity in the
separated DNA bands was quantified in a PhosphorImager
using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics). Prelimin-
ary enzyme activity assays were carried out to ensure linearity
of product formation with respect to both time of incubation
and the amount of extract.
The Km and kcat values of the ND33 APE1 and the full-
length APE1 were determined after incubating 0.01 nM
enzyme with various concentration of THF-containing oligo
substrate at pH 9.2, or with 0.05 nM enzyme at pH 8.0, at 37C
for 4 min in the same reaction buffer as stated before.
DNA 30 phosphodiesterase assay
To measure the DNA 30 end-cleaning activity, a 26mer
oligodeoxynucleotide with U at the 50-terminus was labeled
with [g-32P]ATP by T4 PNK. This oligo was annealed with a
51mer oligo containing a non-complementary 25 nt extension
at the 30 end (30). Subsequent annealing of a complementary
25mer oligonucleotide and treatment with T4 DNA ligase
generated a 51mer duplex with U at position 26 in the labeled
strand. The 51mer duplex oligonucleotide was treated with
E.coli, Udg (35) and Fpg (36) to generate 50 32P-labeled
30 phosphate after excision of U and DNA strand cleavage
owing to the bd lyase activity of Fpg. In a parallel reaction, the
duplex oligonucleotide was treated with Udg (35) and Nth (36)
to generate 30 32P-phospho a,b-unsaturated aldehyde. The
oligonucleotides were purified and treated with APE1 or
PNK as described earlier (30) and the radioactivity in the
free phosphate or phosphoaldehyde was quantified by Phos-
phoImager analysis.
Western analysis
The proteins after SDS–PAGE were transferred to a nitrocel-
lulose membrane (BioRad) and blocked with TBST (20 mM
Tris–HCl), pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl with 0.1% Tween 20 con-
taining 5% non-fat dry milk (37). The membranes were sub-
sequently probed with rabbit anti-hAPE1 IgG (38) or with
anti-lamin b antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), also in
TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk. The bands were visu-
alized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with
Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics).
Synthesis of the 35S-labeled APE1
[35S]hAPE1 was synthesized in vitro via coupled
transcription-translation using TnT-coupled Reticulocyte
Lysate System (Promega). APE1 cDNA cloned in pRSET
B vector (1 mg) was incubated in 50 ml reaction mixture con-
taining [35S]methionine (20 mCi) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Aliquots of 1 ml were individually incubated
with 25 mg extracts of nucleus, cytoplasm or mitochondria
purified from beef liver in buffer A (20 ml) for 30 min at
37C. After stopping the reaction with the loading buffer,
the proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and visualized
with PhosphorImager.
Intracellular localization of full-length and truncated
hAPE1
293 cells grown on cover slips in 35 mm dishes were trans-
fected for 6 h with 0.5 mg plasmid DNA (full-length, ND20
and ND41 APE1-EGFP), using Lipofectamine 2000 and
OptiMEM (Invitrogen), and 18 h later, the live cells were
treated with MitoTracker Red (20 nM). In selected experi-
ments, cells were fixed in methanol: acetone (1:1) and stained
with DAPI. Fluorescent images were captured using a Photo-
metrix Cool-SNAP Fx digital camera mounted on a NIKON
Eclipse TE 200 UV microscope.
RESULTS
Identification of ND33 APE1 as the major mitochondrial
AP-endonuclease
We purified APE activity from beef liver mitochondria as
described in Materials and Methods. Final fractions 12–14
from Heparin–Sepharose chromatography contained the
most APE activity (Figure 1). SDS–PAGE Analysis of fraction
12 indicated a 33 kDa major protein band (Figure 2A) which
showed strong cross-reaction with hAPE1 antibody suggesting
that the 33 kDa species is closely related to APE1 (Figure 2B).
MALDI-TOF and electrospray mass spectrometry after try-
psin digestion of the excised band (1 mg) identified the
peptides as being derived from APE1 (Figure 3A). Subsequent
automated Edman degradation showed the sequences to be
EKEAV at the N-terminus of the band, corresponded to resi-
dues 34–38 in APE1. Thus mtAPE is derived from APE1 after
deletion of 33 N-terminal residues (Figure 3B).
Comparative properties of recombinant human APE1
(hAPE1) and bovine mtAPE
We compared the enzymatic parameters of purified, recom-
binant hAPE1 and bovine mtAPE. The pH dependence of APE
activity showed the pH optimum to be 9.2, and the highest
activity was observed at 50 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2,
for both enzymes (Figure 4). We then compared the specific
activity of full-length hAPE1 and bovine mtAPE by using
equimolar amounts of hAPE1 and purified bovine mtAPE
(Heparin–Sepharose fraction 12). The amount of the bovine
enzyme was estimated by comparison with hAPE1 by quant-
itative western analysis (Figure 5A). Figure 5B shows that
comparable cleavage of THF-oligo (500 nM) required
100 pM hAPE1 and about a third as much bovine enzyme.
Thus the specific activity of bovine mtAPE appeared to be
about 3-fold higher than of full-length hAPE1.

Enhanced endonuclease Activity of ND33 APE1 is due to
increased enzyme turnover
In order to eliminate the possibility that the higher turnover of
bovine mtAPE relative to hAPE1 is due to intrinsic difference
of human and bovine APEs, we purified recombinant ND33
hAPE1 in the same way as the full-length hAPE1. We con-
firmed that the ND33 hAPE1 was indeed three times more
active than the full-length hAPE1 (Figure 6A and B). We
then compared the 30 phosphoesterase activities of full-length
and truncated enzymes with DNA containing 30 phospho a,b
unsaturated aldehyde. This 30 phosphodiesterase activity was
100-fold lower compared with the endonuclease activity of
APE1, in confirmation of earlier observations (4). Neverthe-
less, ND33 hAPE1 had 3-fold higher specific activity than the
full-length APE1 (Figure 6C and D).
On the other hand, full-length and ND33 hAPE1 showed
comparable Km (18 nM) with the THF-oligo substrate sim-
ilar to that observed earlier (39). This indicates N-33 deletion
of APE1 does not affect its substrate affinity. However, the kcat
of ND33 hAPE1 was 3-fold higher than that of the full length
enzyme (Table 1). Although APE1’s specific activity was
5-fold higher at pH 9.2 than at pH 7.4, a similar difference
in specific activities of full-length and truncated APE1 was
maintained at pH 7.4.
ND33 APE1 is the predominant APE in beef liver
mitochondria
That the APE species with N-33 deletion is indeed present in
the mitochondrial matrix, and was not generated artifactually
from full-length APE1 during its purification, was ensured by
immunoblotting extracts of crude, purified and trypsin-treated
mitochondria. Controlled trypsin treatment cleaves most pro-
teins bound to the mitochondrial outer membrane but not the
matrix proteins. Western analysis of extracts of mitochondria
purified through two cycles of sucrose gradient centrifugation
and subsequent trypsin treatment, showed the presence of
only the ND33 APE1 species, and not the full-length protein
(Figure 7A). However, considerable loss of the total APE in
trypsin-treated mitochondria was observed, probably because
of damage to mitochondrial membrane during purification.
Nuclear contamination of mitochondrial preparations as tested
by the presence of lamin B was negligible (data not shown).

Similarly, a very low level of cytoplasmic lactic dehydro-
genase (<1.5% of the cytoplasmic extract) in the mitochondrial
extract indicated only slight contamination with cytosolic pro-
teins. In any case, the presence of ND33 APE1 as the major
form of AP endonuclease in the mitochondrial matrix is evid-
ent, in spite of degradation of both truncated and full-length
APE1 after prolonged trypsin treatment (Figure 7A, lane 4).
To ensure exclusive mitochondrial localization of ND33
APE1, nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial extracts
were used for western blotting with APE1 antibody using
equal amount of protein. Figure 7B shows the presence of
ND33 APE1 only in the mitochondria.
In order to establish that mtAPE is similarly generated
in other mammals by N-terminal cleavage of APE1, we
examined mitochondrial APE in mouse NIH 3T3 cells.
Figure 8A demonstrates the presence of only the truncated
form of APE1 after trypsin treatment of the intact mitochon-
dria (lane 5). The higher level of mtAPE-specific band in
lane 5 compared with that in lane 4 was due to larger amount
of mitochondrial extract in lane 5 and not due to conversion of
the full-length enzyme to the truncated form.
Generation of mtAPE from APE1 by a peptidase in
mitochondrial extracts
To test whether a site-specific peptidase cleaves 33 N-terminal
residues, we incubated 35S-labeled hAPE1 with extracts of
nuclei, mitochondria and cytoplasm purified from the beef
liver. Figure 8B shows that the peptidase activity is associated
with the mitochondria, but is unlikely to be the mitochondrial
matrix peptidase which is responsible for cleaving the MTS of
most mitochondrial proteins.
Intracellular localization of full-length and
truncated APE1
The experiments described so far suggest that mtAPE does
not have an N-terminal MTS, and it appears to be generated

outside the matrix. The ND33 APE1 lacking the NLS is impor-
ted into the mitochondrial matrix possibly via an internal MTS
as with cytochrome C. We tested this possibility by examining
subcellular distribution of ectopic full-length, ND20 and ND41
hAPE1 C-terminally fused to EGFP. The full-length APE1
was mostly localized to the nucleus in live cells as observed
earlier (40) and confirmed by colocalization with DAPI in
fixed cells (Figure 9A and B). The truncated proteins were
predominantly distributed in the cytosol, as well as mitochon-
dria as confirmed by colocalization with Mitotracker Red
(Figure 9C and D). These results are consistent with our
conclusion that the absence of NLS is a prerequisite for mito-
chondrial import of APE1.
DISCUSSION
Since the discovery of robust BER activity in mammalian
mitochondria several years ago (13,19,41), most mitochon-
drial BER enzymes were identified and characterized. How-
ever, the identity of APE, a key BER enzyme was not
established. Several recent studies indicated the presence of

nuclear APE1 in the mitochondria, suggesting that APE1 is not
altered after its mitochondrial import. However, this was unex-
pected because of the apparent absence of N-terminal MTS in
APE1. We decided to adopt the ab initio approach for estab-
lishing the identity of mtAPE, based on activity. We have
shown here that the mtAPE lacks the N-terminal 33 amino
acid residues including the NLS required for nuclear import.
We have further shown that the extract of mitochondria but not
of nuclei or cytosol, cleaves recombinant hAPE1 to generate a
mtAPE-sized product. Our recent studies suggest that a serine
protease associated with mitochondria/ER is responsible for
this activity (B. Szczesny, unpublished data). These results
imply that the loss of NLS is a prerequisite for mitochondrial
import of APE. Most mitochondrial proteins contain
N-terminal MTS which is cleaved off by the mitochondrial
processing peptidase localized within the matrix (42). In the
absence of a candidate MTS at the N-terminus, it appears that
mtAPE, like a few other mitochondrial proteins, has an altern-
ative, internal MTS which is not cleaved for mitochondrial
import. In any event, the level of mtAPE is generally low, and
could not be detected in many cell lines by Western analysis
of total mitochondrial extracts (B. Szczesny, unpublished
data). The mtAPE could be distinguished from APE1 only
by size difference in Western blots, while immunostaining
with APE1 antibody will show the presence of the protein
in both nucleus and mitochondria (25). This may explain
failure to observe mtAPE as a distinct species in some earlier
studies. We would like to point out that the truncated ND33

APE1 was present at a significant level only in beef liver
(Figure 7, lane 2). In contrast, we could detect primarily
the full-length APE1 with a trace of mtAPE-sized band in
variety of human cell lines. We observed the mtAPE in the
mitochondrial extract of mouse NIH 3T3 cells only after tryp-
sin treatment (Figure 8A, lane 5). Our results are thus con-
sistent with earlier observation that the full-length APE1 is the
major species in cultured cells.
It is interesting that deleting 33 N-terminal amino acid
residues increases the specific activity of mtAPE by 3-fold,
primarily because of reduced affinity for the product relative to
the substrate. Product inhibition of early BER enzymes, i.e.
DNA glycosylases and APE has been observed before, leading
to the concept of repair-coordination where the consecutive
steps in the BER pathway could be coupled (43–45). The
disordered N-terminal domain of APE1 is involved in inter-
action with other BER proteins including DNA polymerase b
and XRCC1 (46,47). The absence of some N-terminal residues
in mtAPE suggests that such coordination of BER may not be
critical in mitochondrial DNA repair. At the same time, we
have shown that up to 61 N-terminal amino acid residues in
hAPE1 are dispensable for during in vitro repair activity (48).
It is not known whether residues 34–61 present in mtAPE have
a regulatory role during in vivo repair of mitochondrial gen-
omes. We should also note that APE1 has two distinct roles in
transcriptional regulation. It acts as a reductive activator of
many transcription factors, e.g. C-Jun and p53, and was named
Ref1 for this activity (49,50). Cys65 in APE1 was shown to be
the active residue for Ref1 function which requires 127
N-terminal residues (51). APE1 was subsequently shown to

act directly as a transcriptional repressor of renin, parathyroid
and possibly other genes by participating in protein complexes
which bind to the negative Ca2+ response elements (nCaRE)
(52,53). We have shown the involvement of Lys6/Lys7 acet-
ylation in this process (54). Thus the mtAPE lacks the
acetylation-dependant regulatory activity, while retaining
the Cys65-dependant redox function.
We have examined age-dependent changes in the intra-
cellular distribution of APE1, whose cytosolic distribution
in many cell types is surprising. Analysis of APE activity
in nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of hepato-
cytes from various ages of BALB/C mice showed that the total
APE activity in hepatocyte extracts does not vary significantly,
but its intracellular redistribution occurs with age (31). The
specific activity of APE is 4-fold higher in the nuclei of old
hepatocytes, relatively to the cells obtained from young liver.
The mtAPE level increases even more in old mouse livers. We
hypothesized that chronic oxidative stress associated with
aging is responsible for targeting of APE1 to the nucleus
and mitochondria. Oxidative stress in cultured cells also
increases the levels of APE in mitochondria and nuclei, in
support of our hypothesis (38).
Lieberman and her collaborators have shown that APE1 is a
component of the SET complex in cytotoxic T lymphocytes
and natural killer cells, and is inactivated by the protease
granzyme A which cleaves 31 N-terminal residues from
APE1 (55). We could not explain these results because dele-
tion of up to 61 N-terminal residues does not affect APE1’s
enzymatic activity (48). In fact, deletion of 33 N-terminal
residues enhances APE1’s repair activity as shown here. It
is however possible that, N-terminal truncation leads to
APE1’s degradation in those lymphocytes.
Finally, we have shown recently that APE1 is essential
for survival of APE1 conditional null mutant mouse embryo
fibroblasts (56). Others have shown that APE1 downregula-
tion by siRNA causes apoptosis of both untransformed and
tumor cells (57,58). APE1 is generally believed to be essential
for repairing nuclear DNA damage. However, in view of our
earlier studies raising the possibility of APE1-independent
BER in the nucleus (59), It is tempting to speculate that
APE1’s essentiality is due to its role as a precursor of
mtAPE, and that the lack of mtDNA repair triggers apoptosis
in APE1 deficient cells. It should now be possible to test this
hypothesis using our APE1 conditional mutant cells.
