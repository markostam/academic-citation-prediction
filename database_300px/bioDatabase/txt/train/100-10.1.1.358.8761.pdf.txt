ABSTRACT
Biomedical ontologies provide essential domain
knowledge to drive data integration, information
retrieval, data annotation, natural-language pro-
cessing and decision support. BioPortal (http://
bioportal.bioontology.org) is an open repository
of biomedical ontologies that provides access via
Web services and Web browsers to ontologies
developed in OWL, RDF, OBO format and Prote´ge´
frames. BioPortal functionality includes the ability
to browse, search and visualize ontologies. The
Web interface also facilitates community-based
participation in the evaluation and evolution of
ontology content by providing features to add
notes to ontology terms, mappings between terms
and ontology reviews based on criteria such as
usability, domain coverage, quality of content, and
documentation and support. BioPortal also enables
integrated search of biomedical data resources
such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO),
ClinicalTrials.gov, and ArrayExpress, through the
annotation and indexing of these resources with
ontologies in BioPortal. Thus, BioPortal not only
provides investigators, clinicians, and developers
‘one-stop shopping’ to programmatically access
biomedical ontologies, but also provides support
to integrate data from a variety of biomedical
resources.
INTRODUCTION
As the number of biomedical ontologies increases, so
does the number of repositories that index and organize
ontologies. Some repositories crawl the Web to collect
ontologies (e.g. Swoogle, http://swoogle.umbc.edu;,
Watson, http://watson.kmi.open.ac.uk/Overview.html;
and OntoSelect, http://olp.dfki.de/ontoselect?wicket:
bookmarkablePage=wicket-0:de.dfki.ontoselect.Home),
some request users to submit their ontologies themselves
(e.g. the DAML ontology library. http://www.daml.org/
ontologies; and SchemaWeb, http://www.schemaweb.
info) and others are limited to storage of ontologies
based on ontology representation language [Ontology
Lookup Service, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/
(1,2)]. BioPortal is an open repository of biomedical ontol-
ogies that stores ontologies developed in various formats,
that provides for automatic updates by user submissions
of new versions, and that provides access via Web brow-
sers and through Web services. BioPortal users can browse
and search the ontologies, submit new versions of the
ontologies in the repository, comment on any ontology
(or portion of an ontology) in the repository, add a
review of the ontology, describe their experience in using
the ontology or make suggestions to ontology developers.
The focus on enabling members of the community to con-
tribute actively to BioPortal content and to increase
the value of that content to other users distinguishes
BioPortal from other ontology repositories.
Most researchers in biomedicine, however, are inter-
ested in biomedical data and not the ontologies per se.
Indeed, ontologies provide the means for users to interpret
and integrate the data. One of the key features of
BioPortal is the Open Biomedical Repository (OBR). To
create OBR, we have indexed biomedical data sets avail-
able online (e.g. entries in GEO, ClinicalTrials.gov) with
ontologies in BioPortal. The index links the underlying
data sets to the terms in the ontologies in BioPortal.
While the content of BioPortal focuses on the biomedical
domain, the BioPortal technology is domain-independent.

AVAILABLE DATA
Ontologies
BioPortal contains ontologies that range in subject matter
such as anatomy, phenotype, experimental conditions,
imaging, chemistry, and health. In March 2008, the repos-
itory included 72 ontologies (300 000 total classes) and has
almost doubled in the last year to 134 ontologies (680 000
total classes). Metadata collected for each ontology
include keyword terms, text descriptions, version informa-
tion, release date, ontology author contact information
and links to documentation. Ontology content and meta-
data can be updated automatically or by user submission.
Prior ontology versions are able to be accessed through
both the Web services and Web interface and are available
for download.
Notes
Users can add notes to all ontology classes in BioPortal,
discussing the rationale for modeling decisions, pointing
out problems with deﬁnitions and requesting changes
from ontology authors. Notes are RSS-enabled to provide
timely updates when new notes are added. The content
of the notes can be exported and used in context with
ontology editing software to incorporate changes to the
ontology.
Reviews
BioPortal also supports peer reviews of ontologies. When
a user is evaluating an ontology for use in a project, a key
piece of information is what other projects have used the
ontology and the suitability of the ontology for the tasks
of the project. Users can submit descriptions of their
ontology-based projects to BioPortal and link these
descriptions to BioPortal ontologies. They can provide
comments on the ontology along several diﬀerent dimen-
sions, such as degree of formality, documentation and
support, usability, domain coverage, quality of content.
Mappings
BioPortal also represents mappings between terms in dif-
ferent ontologies. Users can browse the mappings, create
new point-to-point mappings, upload mappings created
with other tools, and download the mappings. They can
add notes on existing mappings and carry out discussions
about the mappings. Each mapping has its own set of
metadata that describes who created the mapping and
when, which algorithm was used to produce the mapping,
application context in which the mapping might be valid,
the speciﬁc mapping relationship, and other properties.
At the time of this writing, BioPortal contains more
than 30 000 mappings created by biomedical researchers
in diﬀerent contexts. Mappings among ontologies consti-
tute a key component that enables the use of the ontolo-
gies for data and information integration. In the future,
we plan to include the ability to access the mapping data
via the BioPortal Web services.
Open biomedical repository
The Open Biomedical Resources (OBR) component
automatically indexes the metadata for important biomed-
ical data sets available online (e.g. entries in GEO,
ArrayExpress, ClinicalTrials.gov), and links the underly-
ing data sets to the terms in the ontologies in BioPortal
and UMLS. The annotation of these resources takes
advantage of the semantic relationships in the ontology,
including subsumption relationships among ontology
terms and mappings among ontologies (3). OBR allows
biomedical investigators to use the terms in the BioPortal
ontologies to enhance their ability to search for relevant
online data in a manner that is not possible with conven-
tional keyword search strategies. These resources can be
accessed through the Resources tab when users navigate
the ontology (Figure 1), via a dedicated search mechanism
or programmatically through Web services.
User interface enhancements
We have added functionality to the BioPortal user inter-
face to facilitate the human computer interaction.
Users can ﬁlter ontologies by group, such as all OBO
Foundry ontologies (4) or caBIG ontologies (e.g. http://
bioportal.bioontology.org/?ﬁlter=OBOFoundry). Users
can also ﬁlter by domain or relevant organism. The full
listing of ontologies available from BioPortal can be
viewed at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies.
RSS feeds provide alerts of changed content, notes,
mappings, new ontology versions, and new ontology
submissions.
Architecture
Ontologies in BioPortal may be represented in OWL,
RDF, OBO format or the Prote´ge´ frame language.
BioPortal uses the Mayo Clinic’s LexGrid system
(http://informatics.mayo.edu/LexGrid) to store ontologies
in OBO format and to access standard biomedical ter-
minologies, such as UMLS. Prote´ge´ (http://protege.
stanford.edu) serves as the backend for OWL, RDF and
Prote´ge´ frames ontologies.
BioPortal adopts a layered architecture approach
(Figure 2), which decouples the logic and domain object
models between each layer. The Presentation Tier delivers
the BioPortal user interface, which currently uses Ruby-
on-Rails technology. The Interface Tier consists of
RESTful Web services that present all BioPortal capabil-
ities to the upper tiers (e.g., browse, search, ontology con-
cept display, visualization, etc.). The Presentation Tier is
driven solely by the RESTful Web services. The Business
Logic Tier provides API access to the ontologies and the
resource index.
Web services
The BioPortal Web services are RESTful services. REST
architecture consists of four verbs (GET, POST, PUT
and DELETE) and nouns, which are URIs for the
resources being accessed. Similar to SOAP services,
RESTful Web services are language and platform inde-
pendent. However, RESTful Web services have additional
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, Web Server issue W171
advantages in that they are light weight, simple and easier
to integrate.
BioPortal Web services include services to get ontology
metadata, to get ontology content, to download an ontol-
ogy, and to search ontologies. Each ontology in BioPortal
is indexed with a stable ontology identiﬁer and is the same
for all versions of the same ontology, ontology versions
are indicated by a version identiﬁer, which changes
from one version to the next. BioPortal Web services pro-
vide a list of the latest versions of all BioPortal ontologies,
enable callers to ﬁnd an ontology identiﬁer based on a
version identiﬁer, ﬁnd all version identiﬁers for a speciﬁc
ontology, and list ontology categories. Web services to get
ontology content include services to get all root concepts,

W172 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37,Web Server issue
get children or parents of a speciﬁc concept, and get
details of a concept. Users can request ontology content
based on the ontology identiﬁer, in which case BioPortal
provides a response based on the latest available version
of the ontology, or they can use a speciﬁc version identi-
ﬁer. In the search service, users can specify whether to
search the whole repository or a speciﬁc set of ontologies,
whether to use exact or approximate matching, and
whether to search only in concept names and synonyms
or in property values as well. A detailed list of Web ser-
vices is available at http://bioontology.org/wiki/index
.php/BioPortal_REST_services. Additional Web services
include a hierarchy service to provide all paths to the
root and all paths to the leaf node terms. These services
can be used to develop applications using ontologies with-
out the need to create a local store of the ontology. A few
examples of projects accessing ontology content from
BioPortal include ISAcreator (http://isatab.sourceforge
.net/isacreator.html), which enables users to structure
experimental metadata, BioLit (5), which provides
metadata describing the content of full text articles
from PubMed Central as ontology terms, and the
Microsoft Word Add-in for Ontology Recognition
(http://ucsdbiolit.codeplex.com/), which enables authors
to include semantic content in documents at the time of
writing.
We are also developing Web services to retrieve
the content of the annotated resources. A few example
services include get all resources, get all annotations for
a given concept (BioPortal or UMLS), and get all annota-
tions for a given resource identiﬁer from GEO, Reactome,
or OMIM for example. Ontology-indexed content can be
accessed and then displayed on a site of interest. For
example, ontology-indexed annotations from GEO using
the Rat Strain ontology and anatomy ontology can be
generated and then the data displayed on a third party
Web site such as the Rat Genome Database by retrieving
the data via the Web services.
DISCUSSION
BioPortal is a repository for ontologies developed in
various formats that allows multiple mechanisms for con-
tent updates and that provides access via Web services.
The incorporation of a variety of Web 2.0 features
allows the system to behave not only as a comprehensive
ontology repository, but also as a general infrastructure to
support community-based access, peer-review, mapping
and annotation of ontology content. BioPortal not only
provides investigators, clinicians and developers ‘one-stop
shopping’ to programmatically access biomedical ontolo-
gies, but also integrates data from various biomedical
resources. The BioPortal technology is open-source and
is domain-independent. Thus, other communities can
reuse the software to maintain their own ontology
repositories.
Currently, the Marine Metadata Interoperability
Project (http://marinemetadata.org/aboutmmi) and
National Cancer Institute (http://bioportal.nci.nih.gov/
ncbo/faces/index.xhtml) are using BioPortal as their
ontology repository.
