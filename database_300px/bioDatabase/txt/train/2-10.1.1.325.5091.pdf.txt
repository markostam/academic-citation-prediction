Abstract
Ovarian cancer is resistant to the antiproliferative effects of
transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B); however, the mecha-
nism of this resistance remains unclear. We used oligonucle-
otide arrays to profile 37 undissected, 68 microdissected
advanced-stage, and 14 microdissected early-stage papillary
serous cancers to identify signaling pathways involved in
ovarian cancer. A total of seven genes involved in TGF-B
signaling were identified that had altered expression >1.5-fold
(P < 0.001) in the ovarian cancer specimens compared with
normal ovarian surface epithelium. The expression of these
genes was coordinately altered: genes that inhibit TGF-B
signaling (DACH1, BMP7 , and EVI1) were up-regulated in
advanced-stage ovarian cancers and, conversely, genes that
enhance TGF-B signaling (PCAF, TFE3, TGFBRII , and SMAD4)
were down-regulated compared with the normal samples. The
microarray data for DACH1 and EVI1 were validated using
quantitative real-time PCR on 22 microdissected ovarian
cancer specimens. The EVI1 gene locus was amplified in 43%
of the tumors, and there was a significant correlation
(P = 0.029) between gene copy number and EVI1 gene
expression. No amplification at the DACH1 locus was found
in any of the samples. DACH1 and EVI1 inhibited TGF-B
signaling in immortalized normal ovarian epithelial cells, and
a dominant-negative DACH1, DACH1-#DS, partially restored
signaling in an ovarian cancer cell line resistant to TGF-B.
These results suggest that altered expression of these genes is
responsible for disrupted TGF-B signaling in ovarian cancer
and they may be useful as new and novel therapeutic targets
for ovarian cancer. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(17): 8404-12)
Introduction
Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal type of gynecologic
cancer in the United States, with modest improvements in survival
over the last 40 years. It is anticipated that there will be 20,180 new
cases of ovarian cancer and 15,310 ovarian cancer–related deaths
diagnosed in the United States in 2006 (1). Typically, ovarian
cancer has few symptoms early in its course, and therefore, the
majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease,
which has a 5-year survival rate of only 30% (2). In contrast, early-
stage ovarian cancer is often curable with a 5-year survival rate of
95%. The advent of new molecular techniques, such as gene
expression profiling, for evaluating cellular processes now allows
the identification of alterations in gene expression that may
elucidate the mechanisms of cancer development and progression.
One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is the loss of response to
inhibitory growth signals, such as transforming growth factor-h
(TGF-h). Cellular processes that are affected by the TGF-h
pathway include regulation of differentiation, inhibition of
epithelial cell proliferation, and apoptosis (3). TGF-h ligands exert
their activity by binding to a family of transmembrane serine/
threonine kinase receptors (4). TGF-h binding to the receptors
initiates a signal cascade, with the Smad proteins being the
primary signal transducers (4). Activated TGFBRI phosphorylates
and activates the downstream signaling components Smad2 and
Smad3 (4). Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 form a complex
with Smad4 followed by translocation from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus where the complex binds to and activates or represses
specific TGF-h-responsive genes involved in proliferation (5). In
addition, TGF-h is also capable of using alternate pathways, such
as the direct binding of Smad3 to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-
acetate-responsive gene promoter elements in the absence or
presence of c-Jun and c-Fos (6).
More recent work has identified genes with regulatory activity in
the TGF-h signaling pathway. Two genes that inhibit TGF-h
signaling have been described, DACH1 (7) and EVI1 (8). DACH1,
a protein with homology to SKI and SKIL, has recently been shown
to be a repressor of the TGF-h pathway in breast cancer cell lines
by binding to the Smad3/Smad4 complex and preventing
transcription (7). EVI1 is a gene that plays a role in progression
of hematopoietic malignancies, such as acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML; ref. 9), by forming a chimeric protein with
AML1. It inhibits TGF-h signaling by physically interacting with
Smad3 to suppress its transcriptional activity (8) and recruiting the
corepressor COOH-terminal binding protein CTBP1 into the
nucleus (10).
Resistance to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-h is important
in the development of many epithelial cancers (3), including
ovarian carcinoma (11, 12). Although many molecular events have
been shown to contribute to this resistance in other epithelial
cancers, the mechanism(s) involved in ovarian cancer remains
unclear. The role of mutational inactivation of TGF-h/Smad
pathway genes in ovarian cancer is still unclear. There have been
conflicting reports about the presence of receptor mutations in
ovarian cancer (13–16). It has also been reported that enhanced
expression of the TGF-h1 and TGF-h3 ligands and loss of

expression of TGFBRI and TGFBRIII may contribute to ovarian
carcinogenesis (17). A more recent extensive study has shown that
primary ovarian epithelial cultures were resistant to the anti-
proliferative effects of TGF-h, although there was no difference in
the expression of the TGF-h receptors or the downstream Smad
signaling components compared with normal human ovarian
surface epithelium (12). This report suggested that TGF-h signaling
is blocked downstream of the Smad complex formation.
In an attempt to better define the mechanism(s) behind the loss
of TGF-h responsiveness in ovarian cancer, we analyzed micro-
array data from 119 ovarian cancers and 10 ovarian surface
epithelium samples for altered expression of genes involved in the
TGF-h signaling pathway. We identified seven genes (DACH1,
PCAF, TFE3, BMP7, EVI1, SMAD4 , and TGFBRII) with altered
expression from normal ovarian surface epithelium. Those genes
that enhanced TGF-h signaling (PCAF, TFE3, SMAD4 , and
TGFBRII) were down-regulated, and those that inhibited TGF-h
signaling (DACH1, EVI1 , and BMP7) were up-regulated; thus, the
net effect of the altered expression of all these genes was the
inhibition of the TGF-h signaling pathway in these tumor samples.
Further analysis of two of these genes (DACH1 and EVI1) showed
that both were able to inhibit TGF-h signaling in immortalized
ovarian epithelial cells. Expression of a dominant-negative DACH1
into an ovarian cancer cell line that expresses high levels of
endogenous DACH1 and is nonresponsive to TGF-h signaling
partially restored TGF-h signaling.
Materials and Methods
Tissue samples. Tissue from 37 stage III or IV grade 3 undissected fresh-
frozen papillary serous ovarian cancers was obtained from the Cooperative
Human Tissue Network and the Gynecologic Oncology Group tissue bank.
Sixty-eight microdissected fresh-frozen advanced-stage grade 3 papillary
serous ovarian cancers, 14 early-stage grade 3 papillary serous ovarian
cancers, 8 low-grade papillary serous ovarian cancers, 20 low-malignant
potential (LMP) ovarian cancers, and 10 normal ovarian surface epithelium
cytobrushing specimens were obtained from the Brigham and Women’s
Hospital (Boston, MA). All samples were obtained under Institutional
Review Board–approved protocols. All tissue samples were stored at
140jC until processed.
Cell lines and culture conditions. IOSE80 immortalized ovarian
surface epithelial cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of 199 (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and 105 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
medium supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-
Products, Woodland, CA), 1% L-glutamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies),
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies). All ovarian
cancer cell lines, with the exception of OVCAR429, were maintained in
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. OVCAR429 cells were
maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen Life Technologies) supplemented with
10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Reporter constructs and expression plasmids. The pKW10 vector
expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged DACH1 as well as pKW10 expressing
a dominant-negative DACH1 (DACH1-DDS) have previously been described
(7). The MSCV vector expressing HA-EVI1 was a kind gift from Dr. G.
Nucifora (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) and has been described
previously (18). The CAGA12-Luc reporter plasmid (19) was kindly provided
by Drs. S. Jakowlew and L. Ozbun [National Cancer Institute (NCI),
Rockville, MD].
Microarray analysis. cRNA from the tissue samples and cytobrushings
was prepared according to the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical
Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and hybridized to the arrays as
described previously (20). Global normalization at a target value of 500 was
applied to all of the arrays under consideration using GeneChip Operating
Software (Affymetrix), and the normalized data were uploaded into the
NCI’s Microarray Analysis Database.6 Biometrics Research Branch (BRB)
ArrayTools version 3.2.27 was used for statistical analysis of the array data.
Probe sets scored as absent (A) at a1 = 0.05 or marginal (M) at a2 = 0.065
were excluded from the analysis. In addition, only those transcripts present
in >50% of the arrays and displaying a variance in the top 50th percentile
were evaluated. This analysis yielded a filtered data set containing 14,119
informative probe sets. Differentially expressed genes were identified for
tumor and ovarian surface epithelium specimens using a multivariate
permutation test in BRB-ArrayTools. A total of 2,000 permutations was
completed to identify the list of probe sets containing <10 false positives at
a confidence of 95%. Differential expression was considered significant at
P < 0.001. The statistic applied to each probe set was a random variance
t test. A list of f3,000 genes with altered expression (P < 0.001) was
generated using these analyses criteria.
Identification of signaling pathways. The gene list generated by
microarray analysis was analyzed using PathwayAssist software version 2.5
(Iobion Informatics, LLC, La Jolla, CA) to identify genes in specific cellular
pathways as reported previously (20).
Comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative PCR. Frozen
sections (7 Am) were cut, and microdissection was done using a Leica LMD
system (Leica, Germany). DNA was extracted and purified using the QIAamp
DNA Micro kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Qiagen, Inc.,
Valencia, CA). Whole-genome amplification was done on the purified DNA by
the GenomiPhi DNA Amplification System (Amersham Biosciences, Piscat-
away, NJ) with the addition of 1.5 AL 50 mmol/L aminoallyl-dUTP (Ambion,
Austin, TX). The mixture was incubated for 17 hours at 30jC followed
by 10 minutes at 65jC and cooling to 4jC. Amplified DNA was then digested
with HaeIII (New England Biolabs, Boston, MA) for 2 hours, precipitated,
and resuspended in 9 AL coupling buffer [0.1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate
(pH 9.0)]. Reconstituted 4.76 mmol/L Cy3 and Cy5 monoreactive dye (2 AL;
Amersham Biosciences) was then added to the aminoallyl-dUTP–labeled
tumor DNAs and normal female control DNAs, respectively. After 1 hour of
incubation at room temperature in the dark, the coupling reaction was
quenched by adding 4.5 AL of 4 mol/L hydroxylamine into the reaction mix.
After 15 minutes, the volume of each sample was adjusted to 50 AL with
nuclease-free water and purified with the NucAway spin column (Ambion).
A total of 50 Ag human Cot-1 DNA and 100 Ag yeast tRNA was added to the
pooled normal and tumor DNA sample, dried under vacuum, and
resuspended in 100 AL hybridization buffer (Hybridization buffer 1, Ambion).
Labeled DNAs were hybridized to a 54,675-element oligo array produced by
the NCI Microarray Facility. After hybridization, the microarray was scanned
using the ScanArray 4000 XL fluorescent scanner (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA),
and the resulting images were analyzed using the QuantArray Express
software (Perkin-Elmer, Downers Grove, IL). The relative fluorescent level or
fluorescent ratio representing the relative amount of target sequences in the
probe mix was analyzed by comparing the fluorescent intensity of
corresponding individual spots after local background subtraction and
normalization. The average local background and SD over all the array spots
were also calculated.
DNA copy number changes of both DACH1 and EVI1 in tumor tissue
samples were validated using Taqman real-time PCR (RT-PCR) amplifica-
tion with Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix with SYBR Green and an ABI
Prism 7300 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). DNA content was normalized to that of Line-1 DNA. Sequences
for the primers used were as follows: EVI1 , 5¶-AAAGCCGCTCAACTA-
CATGG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGCTTTGAATGCGTCCCAGAG-3¶ (reverse);
DACH1 , 5¶-CTTGTCAGAGGGAAGGGTGG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GCAC-
TGTTTGCCGCTTTACTT-3¶ (reverse); and Line-1, 5¶-AAAGCCGCTCAAC-
TACATGG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGCTTTGAATGCGTCCCAGAG-3¶ (reverse).
DNA amplification was done using 95jC for 10 minutes followed by
40 cycles of 95jC for 15 seconds and 60jC for 1 minute. DNA
quantification was assessed by the fluorescence intensity emitted during

each PCR cycle. Copy number changes were calculated by using the
formula 2(N t  N line)  (T t  T line), where N t is the threshold cycle observed
for either the DACH1 or EVI1 primer set in the normal female DNA
sample, N line is the threshold cycle number observed for the Line-1 primer
set in the normal DNA sample, T t is the average threshold cycle observed
for either the DACH1 or EVI1 primer set in a tumor DNA sample, and N t is
the average threshold cycle number observed for the Line-1 primer set in
the tumor DNA sample.
RNA isolation. Total RNA from selected samples was extracted using
Trizol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s instructions
followed by purification using RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen).
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates from the panel of ovarian cancer cell
lines and two immortalized normal ovarian surface epithelial cell lines were
prepared by lysing the cells in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
[150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.4)] supplemented with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
100 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 100 Ag/mL aprotinin. The cell lysates were
sonicated and centrifuged to remove debris, and equal amounts of protein
were separated on polyacrylamide gels as described (7) and incubated with
antibodies to DACH1 (7) and h-actin. The signal was detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence.
Quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the
differential expression of DACH1 and EVI1 . RNA from 22 microdissected
tumor specimens used for microarray analysis and 10 ovarian surface
epithelium samples was used. In addition, RNA from a panel of 14 ovarian
cancer lines and 2 immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cell lines was
also evaluated for expression of EVI1 . Quantitative RT-PCR was done using
an iCycler Real-time Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.,
Hercules, CA) with the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) as
per the manufacturer’s instructions with the following primers: DACH1,
5¶-GGAATGGATTGTGGCTGAAC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGTATTGGACTGG-
TACATCAAG-3¶ (reverse) and EVI1, 5¶-TGCTATGATGCTGTCACTGTC-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-CGTGGCTTATGGACTGGATAG-3¶ (reverse). The fold
change for each target gene was calculated using the 2DDCT method as
described previously (20) with h-glucuronidase (GUSB), glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and cyclophilin A as the reference
genes for the tumor samples and b-actin as the reference gene for the cell
line samples. Sequences of the h-actin primers have been described
previously (20).
Transient transfections and luciferase reporter assays. Exponentially
growing cells were transfected with 200 ng of the CAGA12-Luc promoter
reporter construct alone or in combination with DACH1, DACH1-DDS, or
EVI1 expression constructs using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche
Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Renilla luciferase (20 ng; Promega,
Madison, WI) was cotransfected to control for transfection efficiency. After
overnight incubation, the medium was removed and replaced with serum-
free medium and the cells were allowed to grow for 36 hours. Recombinant
TGF-h1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at a final concentration of 1 ng/mL
was then added to the cells for 12 hours, after which luciferase activity was
measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Knockdown of DACH1 in A547 cells by short hairpin RNA. Three
retroviral DACH1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs (Open Biosystems,
Huntsville, AL) were individually transfected into Phoenix A cells using
Fugene 6 transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the
supernatants were harvested and 1 mL was added to 2 mL of RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin and overlayed onto 1  106 A547 cells in 100-mm dishes.
Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were trypsinized and serially diluted
and stable clones were selected using puromycin. Clones were screened by
Western blot analysis to determine DACH1 expression.
Immunohistochemistry. A total of 31 optimally debulked stage III
grade 3 serous adenocarcinoma cases was used for EVI1 immunostaining.
Immunolocalization of EVI1 was done using the EnVision System/AP
(DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). In brief, 7-Am-thick ovarian tissue
sections were mounted on SuperFrost/Plus microscopic slides (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). EVI1 protein antigens were retrieved by
microwave in 0.01 mol/L citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes.
A polyclonal anti-EVI1 antibody (ProSci, Inc., Poway, CA) at a dilution of
0.5 Ag/mL in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS was used. Negative
controls were done by incubating the tissue sections with 1% BSA-PBS
instead of the primary antibody. An alkaline phosphatase–conjugated
polymer followed by fast red was subsequently applied to the sections. The
intensity of the immunopositive signal was scored with a four-point scale:
0, negative; 1, weak; 2, medium; 3, strong. Five to seven regions were
randomly taken from each section for scoring. The mean score for all the
cases was calculated. The results obtained were correlated with EVI1
mRNA expression levels using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of critical
significance was considered to be P < 0.05. The results showed that samples

Results
Whole-genome expression profiling identifies alterations in
the expression of genes involved in the TGF-B pathway. We
recently reported 1,191 genes that were differentially regulated in
37 undissected papillary serous ovarian cancer specimens com-
pared with normal ovarian surface epithelium (20). Using
PathwayAssist, we identified four genes that mediate TGF-h
signaling that were differentially expressed (P < 0.01) in the
papillary serous ovarian cancer specimens compared with the
normal ovarian surface epithelium by >1.5-fold (Table 1). Those
genes that inhibit TGF-h signaling (DACH1 and BMP7) were up-
regulated in the cancer specimens compared with the normal
ovarian epithelium, and those genes that enhance TGF-h signaling
(PCAF and TFE3) were down-regulated, suggesting that TGF-h
signaling in the cancer specimens was inhibited. To confirm that
these genes were differentially regulated in the epithelial cells
rather than the stroma, we analyzed microarray data from an
independent set of microdissected papillary serous ovarian tumors
consisting of 68 advanced-stage and 14 early-stage specimens using
PathwayAssist. The differential regulation of the genes identified in
the undissected samples (Table 1) was confirmed in the micro-
dissected samples (P < 0.001; Table 2), and furthermore, an
additional three genes (EVI1, TGFBRII , and SMAD4) involved in
TGF-h signaling were identified as being differentially regulated by
z1.5-fold in the microdissected samples compared with normal
ovarian surface epithelium (Table 2). All the genes showed altered
expression in a high percentage (47-100%) of advanced tumors. To
attempt to address at what stage during the development of
ovarian cancer the expression of these genes becomes altered, we
determined their expression in microdissected early-stage ovarian
cancer. All the genes, with the exception of TFE3 , were significantly
altered in early-stage papillary serous ovarian cancer specimens
compared with the normal ovarian surface epithelium (Table 2). Of
further note, the pattern of expression, with respect to fold change,
for the genes described in Table 2 was similar in both the
advanced-stage and the early-stage cancers. DACH1 mRNA
expression, as determined by microarray analysis, was elevated
z1.5-fold compared with the normal ovarian surface epithelium in
72% (49 of 68) of the advanced-stage cancers and 93% (13 of 14) of
the early-stage cancers (Table 2). EVI1 mRNA expression was
increased in all of the advanced-stage cancers and in the majority
of the early-stage cancers (93%; Table 2). BMP7 was only increased
in 47% of the advanced-stage cancers and 57% of the early-stage
cancers. PCAF, TGFBRII, and SMAD4 were all similarly decreased in
both the advanced-stage and the early-stage cancers (Table 2),
whereas TFE3 was only decreased in the advanced-stage cancers
(65%). It was not statistically significantly altered in the early-
stage cancers (Table 2). The differences in the percentages of
advanced-stage and early-stage tumors differentially expressing
each gene were not statistically significant (P > 0.1 for each gene).
None of these differentially regulated genes showed any
correlation with survival (hazard ratio, 0.726-1.151; P > 0.1), and
furthermore, for the early-stage tumors, the relative expression of
these genes was not associated with recurrence (0.9- to 1.7-fold
change; P > 0.2). These results suggest that alteration in the
expression of genes involved in TGF-h signaling is common to
both early-stage and advanced-stage ovarian cancers and further
suggest that TGF-h signaling is inhibited early in the development
of ovarian cancer. In addition, we found that expression of these
genes was also altered in microdissected low-grade and LMP
tumors (Table 2), suggesting that deregulation of these TGF-h
pathway genes is an important early event in the pathogenesis of
all ovarian cancers.
Validation of microarray data. To further analyze the role of
these genes in TGF-h resistance, we focused on the two genes
with the highest level of overexpression, DACH1 and EVI1 , and
validated the expression of each by quantitative RT-PCR on 22
microdissected advanced-stage ovarian cancer specimens and 10
normal ovarian surface epithelial samples (Fig. 1). Expression of
both DACH1 (Fig. 1A) and EVI1 (Fig. 1B) was enhanced (P = 0.01
and 0.0001, respectively) in these samples compared with the
normal ovarian epithelium samples as determined by quantitative
RT-PCR analysis, and these results agreed with the microarray
data (Fig. 1). Immunohistochemistry using an anti-EVI1 antibody
showed that EVI1 protein was also increased in the advanced-
stage ovarian cancer specimens (Fig. 1C) and there was a
significant correlation (P = 0.018) between mRNA and protein
Figure 1. Comparison of microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis for
DACH1 (A ) and EVI1 (B ) in 22 dissected papillary serous ovarian cancer
specimens compared with 10 normal ovarian epithelium samples. The fold
change for the quantitative RT-PCR analysis was calculated by determining the
expression of DACH1 and EVI1 in each sample relative to the expression of

levels as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohisto-
chemistry, respectively (Fig. 1D).
Comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative PCR.
One of the possible mechanisms of enhanced expression of DACH1
and EVI1 in the ovarian cancer specimens is gene amplification.
We randomly selected 23 microdissected advanced-stage ovarian
cancer specimens (with variable expression) to analyze gene copy
number by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and
subsequent quantitative PCR analysis. Our analysis did not show
any increase in gene copy number for DACH1 (located at 13q22) in
23 cases of the advanced-stage cancers, of which 8 samples had
increased mRNA levels as determined by microarray analysis. On
the other hand, 43% (10 of 23) of the microdissected ovarian cancer
specimens showed increased gene copy number (>1.2-fold) for
EVI1 (at 3q24-28) by CGH and the fold changes correlated
significantly with those identified by quantitative PCR (r = 0.613;
P = 0.002). Furthermore, in 16 cases from which both quantitative
PCR and quantitative RT-PCR data were available, there was a
significant correlation between EVI1 DNA copy numbers and levels
of EVI1 mRNA expression (r = 0.529; P = 0.029; Fig. 2A). These
results suggest that, at least for a portion of the microdissected
ovarian cancer specimens, the enhanced expression of EVI1 is the
result of increased gene copy number. Because the phosphatidy-
linositol 3-kinase (PI3K) locus has been reported to be amplified in
ovarian cancer (21, 22) and it is located close to the EVI1 locus, we
analyzed PI3K gene copy number by CGH and quantitative PCR in
the same subset of tumor samples. Interestingly, there was not a
direct correlation between EVI1 and PI3K gene amplification
(Fig. 2B). The majority of the samples analyzed showed a higher
level of amplification at the EVI1 locus than the PI3K locus, with
only few samples showing a higher level of amplification at the
PI3K locus than the EVI1 locus (Fig. 2B). Only one sample showed
similar gene amplification at both gene loci. These results suggest
that both loci are not amplified to the same extent in ovarian
cancer and, because the EVI1 locus seems to be the predominantly
amplified one, imply that amplification of this locus may be more
important in ovarian cancer than amplification of PI3K .
DACH1 and EVI1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines.
DACH1 and EVI1 expression in a panel of 14 ovarian cancer cell
lines and 2 immortalized ovarian cell lines was analyzed by
Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Analysis of
DACH1 protein levels in the panel of ovarian cancer cell lines
showed that A224, OVCAR3, CP70, A2780, AD10, 222, CAOV3, and
A547 cells expressed DACH1 protein at levels at least 2-fold higher
than the two immortalized ovarian cell lines, IOSE80 and IOSE120
(Fig. 3A and B), with A547 cells showing the highest expression.
EVI1 mRNA expression was increased by z1.5-fold in only 43% of
cell lines compared with the normal ovarian cell lines (Fig. 3C),
with A364 cells having the greatest fold increase in EVI1 mRNA.
EVI1 expression was not analyzed by Western blotting, as a suitable
antibody that gave consistent results could not be obtained. It is
important to note that overexpression of these genes in cell lines
seems to occur at a lower rate than that found in primary tumors.
This discrepancy may result from (a) underestimation of the

DACH1 and EVI1 inhibit TGF-B signaling in ovarian cells. To
determine whether DACH1 and EVI1 affect the TGF-h signaling
pathway in ovarian cancer, we examined this pathway in the
IOSE80 immortalized ovarian epithelial cell line and a panel of
ovarian cancer cell lines using a TGF-h-responsive promoter
luciferase construct, CAGA12-Luc. TGF-h stimulation of IOSE80
cells resulted in a 4- to 12-fold increase (P = 0.002) in promoter
activity from this luciferase construct (Fig. 4A), and cotransfection
of DACH1 (Fig. 4A) or EVI1 (Fig. 4B) resulted in an 85% (P = 0.004)
and a 50% (P = 0.007) reduction of this TGF-h-stimulated promoter
activity. A547 cells that express high levels of DACH1 (Fig. 3) also
did not respond to TGF-h (data not shown). To determine whether
this lack of response to TGF-h in the A547 cells was, in part, due to
the high level of DACH1 expression (Fig. 3), we expressed a
dominant-negative DACH1 (DACH1-DDS) in these cells together
with the CAGA12-Luc reporter. This resulted in a dose-dependent
increase in promoter activity (P = 0.007; Fig. 5) under treatment
with TGF-h, suggesting that the high level of DACH1 is responsible,
in part, for the lack of response of A547 cells to TGF-h stimulation.
To confirm this finding, we used shRNA constructs to stably
knock down DACH1 expression in A547 cells. Of three different
shRNA constructs used, only one resulted in knockdown of
DACH1, and we isolated three independent clones that exhibited
lower DACH1 than parental A547 cells (Fig. 6A and B). We used
the other shRNA constructs that did not result in knockdown of
DACH1 as controls (Fig. 6A and C) as well as three clones
transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 6A and B). We tested these
clones for their ability to respond to TGF-h using luciferase
assays with the CAGA12-Luc reporter. Transfection of the
knockdown clones with the CAGA12-Luc reporter resulted in a
small (1.5- to 1.7-fold) but significant (P < 0.05) increase in
response to TGF-h (Fig. 6D) compared with the lack of response
to TGF-h seen in the parental A547 cells. No response to TGF-h
was seen in any of the vector or control shRNA clones (Fig. 6D).
The small increase in promoter activity in response to TGF-h is
possibly due to the fact that DACH1 expression in these cells was
not completely knocked down (Fig. 6A and B). To determine
whether the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-h could be partially
restored in the DACH1 knockdown cells, we did cell growth
assays in the presence of TGF-h and there was no statistically
significant difference in the growth of the DACH1 knockdown
clones compared with the parental or vector clones (data not
shown). It is likely that restoration of TGF-h growth inhibition
requires more substantial knockdown of DACH1 levels. These
results, together with the luciferase assays using the dominant-
negative DACH1, strongly suggest that DACH1 is at least partly
responsible for the lack of response to TGF-h in A547 ovarian
cancer cells.
Discussion
Gene expression profiling is a powerful tool for identifying genes
that are aberrantly expressed in cancer specimens compared with
their normal counterparts. To better understand the role of genes
involved in the resistance to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-h
associated with ovarian cancer, we used expression profiling to
identify genes in the TGF-h pathway that are aberrantly expressed
in ovarian cancers compared with normal surface ovarian

epithelium. We identified seven genes that were differentially
regulated in ovarian cancer specimens compared with normal
ovarian surface epithelium. Those genes that inhibit TGF-h
signaling (DACH1, EVI1 , and BMP7) were up-regulated in the
cancer specimens, and those genes that enhanced TGF-h signaling
(TGFBRII, SMAD4, TFE3 , and PCAF) were down-regulated, result-
ing in a net inhibition of TGF-h signaling in these ovarian cancer
specimens.
Although none of the genes identified from our microarray
analysis have been definitely associated with ovarian cancer, they
have been linked to other epithelial cancers. Mutational
inactivation of TGFBRII has been identified in pancreatic and
biliary cancers (23) as well as in colon cancer (24), and altered
expression of SMAD4 is associated with endometrial cancer (25).
TFE3 acts synergistically with the Smad3 and Smad4 complex to
activate SERPINE1 and Smad7 transcription (26) is inactivated by
gene fusions in renal carcinomas (27–29); BMP7 decreases nuclear
accumulation of Smad3 and up-regulation of serine proteinase
inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; ref. 30), thus
inhibiting TGF-h signaling, is up-regulated in melanoma cell
lines (31), and PCAF, a nuclear coactivator for EVI1 (32) and
Smad3 (33), is not commonly associated with human epithelial
cancers (34).
The mechanism(s) involved in the resistance to the antiprolifer-
ative effects of TGF-h in ovarian cancer has remained unclear. It is
not due to functional mutations in the TGF-h receptors or Smads,
as these occur infrequently (16, 35, 36). It has also been suggested
that other factors, such as epidermal growth factor, abrogate the
antiproliferative effect of TGF-h in vivo (37). Our data suggest that
it is altered gene expression of TGF-h pathway genes that may
account for the resistance of ovarian cancer to the antiproliferative
effects of TGF-h. Several other studies have shown that it is not
alterations in gene expression of TGF-h pathway genes that are
responsible for the resistance of ovarian cancer to the antimito-
genic effects of TGF-h but rather blockage of this pathway
downstream of the Smad complex formation (12, 38). The
discrepancy between these studies and our findings could be due
to the type and number of specimens used in the various studies.
In fact, it has been shown that primary ovarian cancer cells in
culture are responsive to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-h
(38, 39).
Two genes of interest that we identified from our microarray
analysis were DACH1 and EVI1 , both of which inhibit TGF-h
signaling. DACH1 shares structural homology to the Ski and Sno
proto-oncogenes (40), both of which repress activator protein-1
(AP-1) and Smad signaling associated with the TGF-h pathway
(41, 42). DACH1 was recently shown to inhibit TGF-h-induced
apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines by binding to Smad4 and
NCoR (7), but it has not previously been identified to be
associated with ovarian cancer. We showed that it is up-regulated
in the majority of ovarian cancer specimens (72% of advanced-
stage and 93% of early-stage ovarian cancers) profiled by
microarray analysis. We believe that this is the first report
implicating DACH1 in ovarian cancer, and our in vitro data
showing that DACH1 inhibits TGF-h signaling in IOSE80 cells and
a dominant-negative DACH1 (DACH1-DDS), as well as knockdown
of DACH1 expression, restores TGF-h signaling in the A547
ovarian cancer cell line support a role for this protein in the
inhibition of TGF-h signaling in ovarian cancer.
EVI1 is an oncogene that is frequently associated with acute
and chronic myelogenous leukemia (43–45) and has also been

implicated in lung cancer (46, 47) and is overexpressed in
endometrial cancer cell lines (48). EVI1 affects cellular function
via several pathways in hematopoietic cells, including activation
of AP-1 and interaction with the Smad3/Smad4 complex at the
nuclear level, to inhibit TGF-h-induced transcription (44). To
date, only one study has reported altered EVI1 expression in
ovarian cancer (49). Our results indicate that it may play a
significant role in ovarian cancer because the majority of all
ovarian cancer specimens showing markedly increased expression
of this gene by microarray analysis. The importance of EVI1 in
ovarian cancer development is underscored by the fact that a
subset of these tumors shows EVI1 gene amplification. This is an
early genetic event because 93% of patients with early-stage
ovarian cancer have increased EVI1 expression (see Table 2),
suggesting that EVI1 may be important early in the transforma-
tion process and for the development of ovarian cancer.
Somewhat surprisingly, we found that amplification at the EVI1
locus occurred at a higher level than at the PI3K locus, a locus
frequently amplified in ovarian cancer (21, 22), further implicat-
ing amplification of this gene as an important event in the
development of ovarian cancer. Increased EVI1 gene copy
number has been found in non–small cell lung cancer (46, 47)
and esophageal cancer (50).
Our results support previous work, showing that elements of the
TGF-h/Smad signaling pathway remain intact in primary ovarian
cancer cell cultures (12). This study showed minimal differences in
the expression of many genes involved in TGF-h signaling,
including Smad2, Smad3, Smad6, Smad7, SnoN , and Ski . We also
found no difference in expression of these genes in our study.
Further, this group showed that Smad3 and Smad4 phosphoryla-
tion and complex formation were normal in ovarian cancer cells
(12). This led to the suggestion that the TGF-h pathway is blocked
downstream of Smad complex formation and other as yet
unidentified components of the TGF-h pathway are responsible
for this. The results from our study complement these findings and
suggest that EVI1 and DACH1 may be two ideal candidates. EVI1
actively interferes with Smad3 transcriptional activity without
interfering with Smad3/Smad4 complex formation (44), and
DACH1 binds to Smad4 and inhibits TGF-h/Smad signaling (7).
These actions would effectively inhibit the effects of TGF-h without
altering the upstream signaling events. Of note, altered expression
of these seven TGF-h pathway genes shows no prognostic value for
patient survival. We hypothesize that this is the result of the
redundant molecular lesions seen in many of these tumors where
different genes within the TGF-h pathway are affected, resulting in
the inhibition of the pathway. Further, we suspect that the
inhibition of this pathway is an early event in the development
of ovarian cancer. This is supported by the fact that altered
expression of these seven TGF-h pathway genes from normal
ovarian epithelium was found in early-stage tumors. Thus,
essentially all ovarian cancers will have this critical pathway
inhibited early on minimizing its potential to differentially affect
patient survival.
In summary, we believe that global expression profiling applied
to a large sample of carefully processed specimens coupled with
the use of PathwayAssist has allowed us to identify the seven genes
with altered expression in the TGF-h pathway, which may
contribute to the observed TGF-h resistance of ovarian cancers.
We show that two of these genes (DACH1 and EVI1) inhibit TGF-h
signaling in immortalized ovarian epithelial cells and they may be
useful as novel therapeutic targets.
