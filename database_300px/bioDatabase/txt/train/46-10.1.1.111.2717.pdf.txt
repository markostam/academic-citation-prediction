Present knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope immunobiology has been
derived almost exclusively from analyses of subtype B viruses, yet such viruses represent only a minority of
strains currently spreading worldwide. To generate a more representative panel of genetically diverse envelope
genes, we PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced complete gp160 coding regions of 35 primary (peripheral
blood mononuclear cell-propagated) HIV-1 isolates collected at major epicenters of the current AIDS pan-
demic. Analysis of their deduced amino acid sequences revealed several important differences from prototypic
subtype B strains, including changes in the number and distribution of cysteine residues, substantial length
differences in hypervariable regions, and premature truncations in the gp41 domain. Moreover, transiently
expressed glycoprotein precursor molecules varied considerably in both size and carbohydrate content. Phy-
logenetic analyses of full-length env sequences indicated that the panel included members of all major sequence
subtypes of HIV-1 group M (clades A to G), as well as an intersubtype recombinant (F/B) from an infected
individual in Brazil. In addition, all subtype E and three subtype G viruses initially classified on the basis of
partial env sequences were found to cluster in subtype A in the 3* half of their gp41 coding region, suggesting
that they are also recombinant. The biological activity of PCR-derived env genes was examined in a single-
round virus infectivity assay. This analysis identified 20 clones, including 1 from each subtype (or recombi-
nant), which expressed fully functional envelope glycoproteins. One of these, derived from a patient with rapid
CD4 cell decline, contained an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved endocytosis signal (Y721C), as
well as a premature truncation of its gp41 domain, which lacked 17 amino acids. Several other env constructs
mediated virus entry with very poor efficiency, although they did not contain sequence changes predicted to
alter protein function. These results indicate that the env genes of primary HIV-1 isolates collected worldwide
can vary considerably in their genetic, phylogenetic, and biological properties. The panel of env constructs
described here should prove valuable for future structure-function studies of naturally occurring envelope
glycoproteins as well as AIDS vaccine development efforts targeted against a broader spectrum of viruses.
The failure of natural human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) infection to elicit a protective immune response, the
complexities of viral replication and persistence, and the pro-
pensity of the virus for genetic change have suggested that the
development of an effective AIDS vaccine will be difficult (for
reviews, see references 6, 21, 24, and 62). Genetic diversity, in
particular, is believed to pose a formidable challenge, since it
accumulates rapidly (about 1% per year) and affects the struc-
ture, function, and immunogenicity of viral gene products (6,
24, 37). To evaluate the extent of global HIV-1 variation,
sequences of virus strains originating from numerous countries
have been compared (1, 3–5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 19, 20, 22, 23, 29–35,
41, 43, 47, 52–54, 58, 59, 67, 69, 74, 76, 81, 87, 100). These
studies have shown that HIV-1 can be classified into two major
groups, designated M and O, which are defined as distinct
clusters on phylogenetic trees (52, 70, 90, 91). Group M com-
prises the great majority of HIV-1 isolates and can be further
subdivided into at least nine sequence subtypes or clades, des-

ignated A to I (41, 53, 54, 70, 90). Group O has been discov-
ered only recently and thus far includes only a small number of
viruses from Cameroon and Gabon (8, 23, 52, 97). Both groups
are characterized by considerable sequence diversity. For ex-
ample, Env amino acid sequence variation within group M
ranges from 3 to 23% among members of the same subtype
and from 25 to 35% among members of different subtypes.
Group O viruses exhibit a similar level of diversity but have not
been classified into subtypes because of the small number of
representatives characterized (52). The two groups, M and O,
differ by up to 47% in their Env protein sequences. Finally,
recent data indicate that individuals can become coinfected
with viruses belonging to different subtypes of group M and
that this can result in the production of recombinants (82, 83,
87). Thus, intersubtype recombination can generate yet more
viral diversity, with potential consequences for vaccine devel-
opment.
Given this degree of diversity, it is widely believed that a
vaccine based on a single strain or subtype of HIV-1 will be
unsuccessful against the larger spectrum of globally circulating
HIV-1 variants (62). Most vaccine formulations currently in
clinical trials contain immunogens derived exclusively from
subtype B viruses, the predominant genotype in the United
States and Europe (21). By contrast, little emphasis has been
placed on the development of candidate vaccines against non-
subtype B viruses, although these cause the vast majority of
HIV-1 infections in developing countries, where they continue
to spread extremely rapidly (e.g., subtype A in central Africa
[100], subtype C in India [22, 30], and subtype E in Thailand
[44, 99]). One reason for the emphasis on subtype B vaccines
has been the lack of well-characterized virologic reagents cor-
responding to the other clades, many of which have been
discovered only recently (e.g., subtypes F, G, H, and I [12, 32,
41]). Another reason is that even for subtype B viruses, the
correlates of protective immunity remain unknown. In the ab-
sence of these data, it is impossible to predict which combina-
tions of viral antigens from which genetic subtypes are likely to
produce the broadest immunity.
Given the increasing importance of genetically diverse viral
strains in the global AIDS pandemic, it is clear that a compre-
hensive vaccine strategy must include non-subtype B viruses. In
particular, clones encoding functional env gene products are
required for the generation of subtype-specific immunological
reagents, recombinant vectors for protein expression, and
DNA- or protein-based subunit vaccines. Most full-length en-
velope sequences in the HIV database are derived from viruses
adapted to grow in immortalized T-cell lines (71), raising the
possibility that their structure-function relationships are not
biologically or clinically germane (66). Moreover, most enve-
lopes available from peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC)-propagated viruses have not been functionally char-
acterized (71), again raising concerns about the relevance of
available clones and sequences for certain biological applica-
tions. Because of the growing need for functionally active en-
velope clones, particularly for non-subtype B viruses, we have
generated a comprehensive panel of genetically diverse env
genes from 35 primary HIV-1 isolates (PBMC cocultures). In
this paper, we describe their genetic, phylogenetic, and biolog-
ical characterization and confirm their function in the context
of infectious HIV-1 virions. This panel of recombinant enve-
lope constructs thus represents a unique collection of reagents,
which should be useful for investigators interested in HIV-1
envelope biology and vaccine development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus isolates. The majority of HIV-1 isolates used in this study were obtained
from the World Health Organization (WHO)- and National Institutes of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored Networks for Virus isolation and
Characterization and represent viruses collected at potential vaccine evaluation
sites (Table 1). Additional isolates were obtained from two acute (symptomatic)
seroconvertors (91US005 and 91US006) evaluated at the University of Alabama
at Birmingham (UAB), a Zairian patient with end-stage AIDS (93ZR001), an
individual (92US657) enrolled in the Multi AIDS Center Study cohort (MACS),
and two patients (93UG975 and 92RU131) with known subtype G infections
studied at St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School in London (SMHMS). Informed
consent was obtained from all study subjects prior to blood collection. Epidemi-
ological and clinical information relevant to this study, as well as references
describing the various cohorts or individual cases in greater detail, is summarized
in Table 1. For consistency, isolates were labelled according to WHO nomen-
clature (40); some isolates have been reported previously under different names,
and these are listed in parentheses. All isolates were established and propagated
by cocultivation with normal donor PBMCs (27, 85). For most cultures, the
number of in vitro passages was less than five. High-molecular-weight DNA was
extracted from expanded PBMC cultures as described previously (57). Prelimi-
nary subtype designation of isolates was made on the basis of partial env gene
sequences (WHO, UAB and SMHMS isolates [4, 19, 34, 100]) or by heterodu-
plex mobility analysis of PCR-amplified gp120 (V1 to V5) fragments (WHO,
NIAID, and MACS isolates [9]).
PCR amplification of full-length gp160 genes. PCR amplification was carried
out as described previously (19) with minor modifications. All env (gp160) genes
were amplified from cultured PBMC DNA. Most isolates required two rounds of
PCR to yield sufficient quantities of amplification products for further subcloning
(env A [59-GGCTTAGGCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAAGAA-39] and env N [59-
CTGCCAATCAGGGAAGTAGCCTTGTGT-39] in the first round; env B [59-
AGAAAGAGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA-39] and env M, [59-TAGCCCT
TCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTA-39] in the second round). Isolates 92UG037,
92UG975, 93BR019, 93BR020, and 93BR029 required only a single round, with
primer pairs env B and env N. Finally, an entire tat-rev-vpu-env cassette was
amplified from isolate 92US657 with primers S1 (59-ATATCTATGAAACT
TATGGGGATAC-39) and env N in the first round and S2 (59-GGCAGGAGT
GGAAGCCATAATAAGAA-39) and env M in the second round.
PCRs were carried out with a total volume of 100 ml, containing 10 mM Tris
HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (wt/vol) gelatin, 200 mM
deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 20 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 U of Taq poly-
merase. Samples were subjected to 35 cycles of a denaturing step at 948C for 1
min, an annealing step at 558C for 1 min, and an extension step at 728C for 6 min
(in some instances, annealing and extension temperatures were varied to achieve

optimal amplification). PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electro-
phoresis, purified from gel slices with Geneclean (Bio 101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.),
and subcloned into pCRII by T/A overhang (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.).
Recombinant clones were identified by colony hybridization and mapped by
restriction enzyme digestion of plasmid miniprep DNA.
PCR amplification of partial env sequences from uncultured PBMC DNA. A
1,300-bp fragment spanning the C terminus of gp41 was amplified from uncul-
tured PBMC DNA from subject 93BR019 by nested PCR (first round, env B7
[59-GAGCAGCAGGAAGCACTATGGGCGC-39] and env N; second round,
env B7 and env M; 30 cycles of 948C for 1 min, 408C for 1 min, and 728C for 4
min). The amplification product was visualized on an agarose gel, purified with
Geneclean, and sequenced directly without interim cloning.
Transient expression of HIV-1 envelope genes in mammalian cells. Full-length
pCRII-gp160 clones were analyzed for their functional integrity in a T7-based
transient-expression system (19). Briefly, HeLa cells (2 3 105) were seeded in
six-well plates and grown to 80 to 90% confluency. Monolayers were infected at
a multiplicity of infection of 10 with a recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the T7
RNA polymerase gene (16). Following a 90-min adsorption period, cells were
washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution and then transfected with 1.5 mg of
pCRII plasmid DNA containing full-length and properly oriented gp160 genes
by using the Lipofectin method (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.). After 5 h, the
medium was changed and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s minimum es-
sential medium plus 10% fetal calf serum overnight. The HeLa cells were then
washed twice with Hanks balanced salt solution, starved for 30 min in methio-
nine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (Gibco BRL),
labelled with 100 mCi of [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.,
Irvine, Calif.) per ml for 30 min at 378C, and chased with complete medium for
1 h. For gel electrophoresis, cells were lysed with 300 ml of RIPA lysing buffer (50
mM Tris HCl [pH 7.4], 1% Triton X-100, 0.15% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS],
150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA) for 5 min at 48C. Protein A-agarose was reacted
with serum from an HIV-1-infected individual overnight at 48C, washed three
times with RIPA buffer, added to labelled cell lysates, and incubated overnight

at 48C. Protein A-agarose complexes were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in
loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 1% SDS, 0.7 M 2-mercaptoethanol,
0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), boiled for 2 min, and loaded onto SDS–6
or 8% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were fixed, enhanced for 30 min, dried, and
analyzed by autoradiography.
Inhibition of gp160 N-glycosylation by tunicamycin. HeLa cells were infected
with recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the T7 gene and transfected with
pCRII-gp160 constructs as described above, except for the addition of the gly-
cosylation inhibitor tunicamycin to the culture supernatant (1 mg/ml) 5 h before
radiolabelling and immunoprecipitation with serum from an HIV-1-positive pa-
tient.
In vitro transcription and translation of HIV-1 env genes. In vitro transcrip-
tion and translation of PCR-derived gp160 genes were performed with the TNT
coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, Wis.) as specified by the
manufacturer. Briefly, 1 mg of plasmid DNA (pCRII-gp160 constructs) was
added to the TNT lysate (50-ml reaction volume) containing 40 mCi [35S]methi-
onine-[35S]cysteine as well as the appropriate polymerase (T7 or SP6) depending
on insert orientation. Following incubation for 1 h at 308C, 5 ml of reaction
mixture was added to 20 ml of RIPA loading buffer, boiled for 2 min, electro-
phoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by autoradiography.
Single-round virus infectivity assay. PCR-derived env genes (pCRII-gp160s)
were cloned into plasmid pSVIIIenv(Kpn) (25) under the control of an HIV-1
long terminal repeat promoter (Fig. 1). This was done by digesting pSVIII
env(Kpn) with KpnI and by exchanging the HXB2 env coding region (except for
36 amino acid residues at the N terminus) with the corresponding KpnI frag-
ments of selected pCRII-gp160 constructs. Five pCRII-gp160 constructs lacked
KpnI cloning sites (92RW020.5, MA301959.18, TH301966.8, TH301975.15, and
TH301976.17), thus requiring reamplification and introduction of KpnI sites by
PCR mutagenesis.
To determine whether the pSVIII-gp160 constructs expressed functionally
active envelope genes, Cos-1 cells (2 3 105 per well) were cotransfected with
these constructs (5 mg) and HXBH10DenvCAT (2.5 mg), an env-deficient HIV-1
provirus which contains a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in
place of the nef gene (56). At 16 h following transfection, cells were washed and
cultured in complete Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium for 2 days at 378C.
Supernatant was then collected, and equivalent amounts of produced virions
(based on reverse transcriptase activity) were used to infect 2 3 106 normal
donor PBMCs. Following 2 days in culture, PBMCs were pelleted, washed with
10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and resuspended in 150 ml of 0.25 M
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing and
centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and lysates were assayed for CAT activity
with [14C]chloramphenicol as previously described (11). The products were sub-
sequently subjected to thin-layer chromatography, exposed to film, and quanti-
tated with a phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics) radioanalytical imaging sys-
tem.
Sequence analysis. Sequence analysis was performed by cycle-sequencing and
dye terminator methods with an automated DNA Sequenator (model 373A;
Applied Biosystems, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Individual
sequence fragments were assembled by using the Sequencher program (Gene
Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, Mich.) and analyzed with Eugene (Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston, Tex.), PIMA (92, 93), MASE (13), and DOTS (45). Se-
quences were determined for both strands of DNA (each base pair was se-
quenced at least three times). GenBank accession numbers are listed in Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic relationships of the newly characterized
viruses were estimated from comparisons of env nucleotide sequences with those
of previously reported representatives of group M subtypes A to G (71); subtype
H and I viruses were not included, since only partial env sequences are presently
available. Nucleotide sequences were aligned by using CLUSTAL (26) with
minor manual adjustments, bearing in mind their predicted protein sequences.
Pairwise evolutionary distances were estimated by using Kimura’s two-parameter
method (36) to correct for superimposed substitutions; sites where there was a
gap in any sequence and ambiguous areas within the alignment were excluded
from all comparisons. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-
joining method (88), and their reliability was estimated from 1,000 bootstrap
replicates (14). These methods were implemented by using CLUSTAL W (96).
Phylogenetic relationships were also analyzed by the maximum-parsimony
method with repeated randomized input order, implemented by using the pro-
gram DNAPARS from the PHYLIP package (15). The results were the same as
those obtained from the neighbor-joining method in all essential aspects.
Recombination breakpoint analysis. All newly determined env sequences were
analyzed for any evidence of mosaicism generated by intersubtype recombination
(82, 83). Phylogenetic trees were constructed from regions (of 300 to 500 bp)
within the env sequence alignment (available upon request) and examined for
discrepant subtype assignments. Viruses exhibiting significantly discordant
branching positions in different trees were identified as putative recombinants.
To localize the recombination breakpoints within each of these viruses, we
examined the linear distribution of phylogenetically informative sites in a four-
sequence alignment, including the putative recombinant, a consensus sequence
for each of the two subtypes inferred to have been involved in the recombination
event, and a simian immunodeficiency virus outgroup (SIVCPZGAB). Break-
points were inserted at each possible point between adjacent informative sites,
and a 2 3 2 heterogeneity x2 value was calculated for the numbers of sites (to
either side of the breakpoint) supporting the clustering of the putative recom-
binant with each of the consensus sequences. The likely breakpoint was identified
as that which gave the maximal x2 value. To assess the probability of obtaining
by chance as high a x2 value as that observed, 10,000 simulations were performed
in which the informative sites were randomly shuffled.

panel of functional HIV-1 envelope constructs that was repre-
sentative of genetically diverse viruses circulating worldwide.
For this purpose, we selected 35 isolates from individuals who
acquired their HIV-1 infection relatively recently in the United
States, Haiti, Brazil, Thailand, Russia, Rwanda, Uganda,
Malawi, and Zaire. These viruses were also known to represent
all major sequence subtypes of HIV-1 group M (clades A to G)
on the basis of preliminary sequence or heteroduplex gel shift
analysis (4, 9, 19, 34, 100). Table 1 summarizes available de-
mographic and clinical information, as well as biological data
concerning the isolate phenotype (SI/NSI). Only viruses grown
in normal donor PBMCs were selected for analysis. Emphasis
was placed on isolates from known seroconvertors (established
within 2 years of primary infection), on viruses collected at
international vaccine evaluation sites (sponsored by both
WHO and NIAID), and on isolates from different risk groups
(heterosexual, homosexual, intravenous drug users, etc.). Fi-
nally, isolates from Brazil, Thailand, Haiti, and the United
States were selected to ensure a wide geographic representa-
tion of subtype B viruses. The envelope genes reported in this
study are thus representative of naturally occurring HIV-1
infections worldwide and are not biased with respect to in vitro
culture methods, mode of transmission, disease association, or
geographic origin.
PCR amplification and transient expression of full-length
gp160 genes. PCR amplification of complete gp160 genes was
performed with primers designed according to HIV-1 group M
consensus sequences. Amplification products contained the
entire gp160 coding region (as well as adjacent nef sequences),
except for the first 4 bases of the env gene (ATGA) which were
derived from the PCR primer. All isolates, regardless of sub-
type classification, yielded PCR amplification products with
the same set of primer pairs. Amplified env fragments were
purified following gel electrophoresis (to remove smaller am-
plification products) and ligated into pCRII by T/A overhang.
This vector was chosen because it does not require restriction
enzyme cleavage for subcloning and contains a T7 promoter,
which facilitates expression of properly oriented env genes in a
transient T7-based expression system (pCRII also contains an
SP6 promotor which allows in vitro translation of gp160 genes
in the TNT system [Fig. 1]). Restriction enzyme sites in the
plasmid polylinker allow excision of the complete env gene for
additional genetic manipulation.
To identify clones that contained uninterrupted gp160 cod-
ing regions, HeLa cells were infected with a recombinant vac-
cinia virus carrying the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and
then transfected with pCRII-gp160 constructs containing full-
length (based on restriction enzyme analysis) and properly
oriented inserts. Expressed envelope glycoproteins were radio-
labelled with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine, precipitated with
HIV-1 antiserum, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis. Figure 2 depicts such an analysis for representative
pCRII-gp160 constructs (because of the experimental condi-
tions used, only unprocessed gp160 precursor molecules are
detected). Expression levels were comparable for all con-
structs, although the molecular mass of the various gp160 pro-
teins differed somewhat (sizes ranged between 140 and 170
kDa). Using this approach, we identified expression-competent
env constructs for all isolates, except for 92US714 (expression
data are summarized in Table 2). Transient expression of
PCR-derived envelope genes thus represents an efficient
means to exclude defective gp160 clones prior to sequence
analysis.

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of different envelope expression plasmids. PCR-derived full-length gp160 sequences were subcloned into pCRII by T/A overhang,
generating the pCRII-gp160 constructs (the first four nucleotides of the amplification products are derived from primer env B). The positions of T7 and SP6 promoters,
as well as the location of the plasmid polylinker (thick line) in relation to the inserted env genes, are indicated. Also shown are the positions of conserved KpnI sites,
which were used to replace the HXB2 env gene in plasmid pSVIIIenv(Kpn) with the corresponding pCRII-gp160 fragments. A 36-amino-acid stretch remaining from
the HXB2 env gene product is highlighted (light shade). The relative positions of gp120 and gp41 coding regions, nef, rev, the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and
the simian virus 40 (SV40) origin of replication are indicated. The composition of the pSVIIIenv(Kpn) plasmid has been described previously (25). SP, signal peptide.

sor molecules is indicated (because of the experimental conditions used, only
unprocessed gp160 precursor molecules are detectable). The blot includes rep-
resentative clones from all subtypes.

For most isolates, one expression-competent pCRII-gp160
construct (or in the case of 92US714, one construct containing
a full-length insert) was selected for nucleotide sequence anal-
ysis. Two clones were sequenced for isolates 91HT651,
93BR019, and 92RU131 (Table 2). Figure 3 depicts an align-
ment of their deduced envelope amino acid sequences (solid
circles indicate previously reported sequences, which are in-
cluded for comparison [19]). As expected, all expression com-
petent constructs contained uninterrupted env open reading
frames. 92US714.1 contained an in-frame stop codon in the
signal peptide, thus explaining its failure to yield an expression
product. Two other clones, however, were also found to en-
code genetically altered gp160 genes. 91US005.11 contained a
34-bp deletion followed by an in-frame stop codon (at position
2541), and 92US711.14 contained a frameshift mutation (at
position 2190), both resulting in a premature truncation of
their gp41 proteins (Fig. 3). These truncations could not be
recognized in the transient-expression assay because of the
considerable size variation among the different (intact) gp160
precursor proteins (compare Fig. 2).
Sequence alignment also identified potentially important
amino acid variations in some clones. Seven envelope se-
quences exhibited differences in the number and distribution
of cysteine residues within their gp120 and extracellular
gp41 coding regions (highlighted by circles in Fig. 3). Three
of these contained an extra cysteine pair in a hypervariable
region (V1 for clone 92RU131.9; V4 for clones 92TH022.4
and 93TH966.8). Four others contained single cysteine
changes, including the loss of a highly conserved cysteine be-
tween V1 and V2. Since all cysteine residues in subtype B
viruses are believed to form disulfide bonds (48), the finding of
nonpaired cysteine changes suggests differences in glycopro-
tein three-dimensional structure and possibly altered biological
function. Finally, three clones exhibited unusually long V1
(92HT593.1), V2 (92US714.1), or V3 (92HT599.24) regions,
and one clone (93TH975.15) contained an amino acid substi-
tution in a conserved domain (E364K) previously shown to be
important for CD4 binding (75).
Phylogenetic analyses. To determine the subtype classifica-
tion of the newly characterized isolates, phylogenetic trees
were constructed from full-length gp160 nucleotide sequences
(Fig. 4). All 35 viruses fell into the expected sequence subtypes

consistent with their preliminary classification based on het-
eroduplex mobility analysis or partial sequence analysis. None
of the newly identified viruses were closely related to each
other, except for two subtype B Haitian isolates (92HT594 and
92HT596), whose env nucleotide sequences differed by only
2%. The other subtype B viruses were approximately equidis-
tantly related and differed on average by 9%, which is typical
for epidemiologically unrelated subtype B viruses. Considering
the extent of sequence divergence that generally arises within
a cultured isolate (the intraisolate variation in this study was
,1.5%), it is unlikely that the close relationship of 92HT594
and 92HT596 represents a laboratory contamination (38). In-
stead, the similarity of the two Haitian isolates most probably
indicates that they were derived from individuals with epide-
miologically linked infections (definitive conclusions cannot be
drawn because of lack of epidemiological information).
The phylogenetic positions of the newly characterized vi-
ruses were also examined with respect to their geographic
origins. As expected (58, 76, 99), viruses from heterosexual
transmission cases in Thailand clustered in subtype E, while a
Thai intravenous drug user was infected with a virus clustering
in subtype B. Viruses from Brazil clustered within subtypes B,
C, and F. Heterosexually infected women from Malawi were
infected with viruses belonging to subtype C. Viruses obtained
from African nationals (originating from Uganda, Rwanda,
and Zaire) clustered in subtypes A, D, or G. All Haitian and
U.S. isolates grouped in subtype B. Finally, an isolate from
Russia known to have resulted from a nosocomial infection (4,
5) was confirmed to belong to subtype G. Thus, our results are
in good agreement with previously reported information con-
cerning the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 group M (19, 37,
70, 71, 90).
Intersubtype recombination. Because recombination has re-
cently been reported to occur among members of different
group M subtypes (82, 83, 87), we examined the PCR-derived
env sequences more closely for evidence of mosaicism. Phylo-
genetic trees were constructed from regions within the env
(and partial nef) sequence alignment and examined for dis-
crepant subtype assignments. The results showed that most of
the newly characterized strains clustered consistently with re-
spect to their original subtype classification. However, three
sets of clones exhibited discordant branching orders. The first
was an isolate derived from a Brazilian individual (93BR019),
which was a mosaic of subtypes B and F. Approximately 200 bp
of sequence from the 39 region of gp41 clustered in subtype B,
but the surrounding sequences, i.e., the remainder of env and
the 59 region of nef, fell into subtype F. These discordant
phylogenetic positions were observed for two different clones
(93BR019.4 and 93BR019.10) from the same isolate and were
supported by high bootstrap values (Fig. 5A).
To investigate further the recombinant nature of the
93BR019 virus, we obtained uncultured PBMCs from this sub-
ject and amplified viral sequences directly without interim cul-
ture. The sequence of a 1,217-bp fragment spanning the mosaic
gp41 region was determined and aligned with 93BR019.4 and
93BR019.10. This analysis showed that sequences amplified
from cultured and uncultured patient material were very
closely related to each other (1% divergence) and that they
exhibited the same discordant positions in phylogenetic trees
(Fig. 5A). Importantly, PCR products were sequenced directly
without prior subcloning (93BR019.dir) to characterize the
most predominant proviral form present in vivo.
To map the recombination breakpoints more precisely, we
examined the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites
along the amplified gp41 fragment. As shown in Fig. 5B, sites
supporting the grouping of 93BR019.dir with subtype B (des-
ignated 1 under the alignment) clustered in a 198-bp region
immediately 59 to the C terminus of gp41. Sites supporting the
grouping of 93BR019.dir with subtype F (designated 2) clus-
tered 59 and 39 to this region. Maximum x2 analysis indicated
the likely breakpoints which were found to be statistically sig-
nificant (P , 0.0001) in simulation studies. Similar analyses of
env sequences from the cultured isolate (performed on
clone 93BR019.4) placed breakpoints at the same positions
(Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results indicate that subject
93BR019 was infected with an intersubtype recombinant
composed of F and B sequences.
A second example of apparent mosaicism involved isolates
92UG975 and 92RU131. Sequences from these viruses clus-
tered with isolates classified as subtype G (GA-VI525 and
LBV21-7 [53, 54]) for almost the entire env coding region
(nucleotides 1 to 2450 of the env consensus sequence) (Fig.
6A) but with subtype A at the 39 end of gp41 (nucleotides 2451
to 2925) (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, similar discordant phyloge-
netic positions were observed for LBV21-7 (Fig. 6), which
represents one of only two complete ‘‘subtype G’’ envelope

sequences currently in the database (71). The other, GA-
VI525, is also recombinant (as a whole), because its env se-
quences cluster in subtype G whereas its gag sequences cluster
in subtype H (32, 83). In the 39 region of env, GA-VI525
remained distinct from other subtypes (Fig. 6B). However,
since there is no sequence for this region from any subtype H
virus, we cannot be certain that this phylogenetic position of
GA-VI525 reflects that its entire env gene is of subtype G
origin (this 39 region of env could, like gag, be of subtype H
origin). Nevertheless, the former explanation appears to be
much simpler, and we have thus performed breakpoint analysis
(as above for 93BR019) for 92UG975 and 92RU131 by using
GA-VI525 as the subtype G ‘‘consensus.’’ These analyses iden-
tified a significant (P , 0.0001) breakpoint at about position
2260 in both 92UG975 and 92RU131 (i.e., 39 codons upstream
of the region encoding the membrane-spanning domain in
gp41), leading us to conclude that both are probably G/A
recombinants. A similar analysis for LBV21-7 placed a (signif-
icant) breakpoint at around position 2380. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the breakpoints for all three of
these ‘‘subtype G’’ viruses are in fact the same, since there are
only a small number of informative sites in this region and only
a single sequence was used to construct the subtype G ‘‘con-
sensus.’’ If the breakpoints were the same, this would imply
that the recombination event had occurred in a common an-
cestor of the three viruses.
Finally, discordant branching orders were also seen for all
three new subtype E envelope sequences. These sequences
clustered closely with CM240, a prototypic subtype E virus also
from Thailand. As in the example above, these subtype E
viruses formed a distinct cluster for most of their env coding
region but grouped with subtype A at the 39 end of gp41 (Fig.
6). All ‘‘subtype E’’ viruses from Thailand have been found to
be closely related, presumably reflecting a founder event (70,
90). Also, for all those that have been examined, their gag
sequences fall within subtype A, as if the founder virus was an
A/E recombinant (70, 90). Our finding of subtype A-like se-
quences at the 39 end of subtype E env genes is consistent with
this hypothesis. However, we could not use the recombination
breakpoint analysis described above for these viruses because

no sequence is yet available for any virus known to be a full-
length representative of subtype E. Thus, as with the putative
G/A recombinants 92UG975 and 92RU131, definitive analysis
must await additional sequence information.
Functional characterization of PCR-derived envelope
clones. To assess the biological activity of the PCR-derived env
genes in the context of HIV-1 virions, we used a single-round
infection assay previously described for structure-function
analysis of mutant envelope clones (25). The assay is based on
the coexpression of a candidate env glycoprotein (under the
control of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter) with an
HIV-1 proviral clone which is defective in env but contains the
CAT gene in place of the nef gene (25, 56). Infectivity of in
trans complemented virions is measured by quantifying the
amount of CAT activity present in newly infected target cells.
This assay thus examines biosynthesis, transport, packaging,
fusogenicity, and uncoating and scores positive only if the in
trans complemented envelope glycoproteins perform all of
these functions efficiently.
Using a highly conserved KpnI site (located 12 codons down-
stream of the region encoding the signal sequence cleavage
site), we subcloned the majority of the PCR-derived envelope
genes into the vector pSVIIIenv(Kpn) (compare Fig. 1). The
resulting constructs (pSVIII-gp160) were then individually co-
transfected with pHXBH10DenvCAT (56), and equivalent
amounts of progeny virions (based on reverse transcriptase
activity) were used to infect phytohemagglutinin-stimulated
normal donor lymphocytes. Clones were tested in nine inde-
pendent experiments, with representative CAT activity data
depicted in Fig. 7. The results identified 20 of 28 envelope
constructs tested to yield positive CAT activity in all assays
(Table 2). Eight of these constructs were strongly positive
(.30% conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms),
six were moderately positive (10 to 30% conversion), and six
were weakly positive (1 to 10% conversion). The remaining
eight env constructs scored weakly positive in some but not all
experiments (designated borderline positive in Table 2). Since
the CAT-based complementation assay depends on efficient
cotransfection, an occasional negative result may indicate sub-
optimal transfection levels. However, the borderline-positive
clones were tested in multiple independent experiments (Table
2) and thus appear to have partial biological activity. Never-
theless, their ability to facilitate virus entry into new target cells
appears to be greatly diminished.
Expression of envelope glycoproteins in the presence of tu-
nicamycin. Because the envelope glycoprotein of a subtype D
virus (HIV-1NDK) was recently reported to differ from subtype
B env glycoproteins in size and carbohydrate content (103), we
examined whether our panel of envelopes exhibited similar
differences and whether such variations occurred in a subtype-
specific manner. For this purpose, we first expressed the
pCRII-gp160 constructs in the presence of tunicamycin. This
compound is known to inhibit N-linked but not O-linked gly-
cosylation. As shown in Fig. 8a, envelope precursor proteins
varied in size but not according to their subtype classification.
Similar results were obtained following in vitro translation
(Fig. 8b), which prevents all forms of glycosylation. These
results thus indicate that the size of the envelope precursor
backbone as well as the extent of its glycosylation can differ
considerably among genetically divergent HIV-1 strains. How-
ever, this variation does not appear to correlate with the se-
quence subtype.
PCR amplification of a tat-rev-env cassette from isolate
92US657. Because a number of vector systems with potential
utility in vaccine development require Tat and Rev proteins for
efficient envelope glycoprotein expression, we tested the pos-
sibility of amplifying complete tat-rev-env cassettes from a se-
lected number of HIV-1 isolates. By using newly designed
sense primers upstream of the first exon of tat (see Materials
and Methods), amplification products were obtained for most
viruses. However, subsequent subcloning into pCRII proved to
be extremely difficult. On average, several hundred colonies
had to be screened to identify one clone with a full-length
insert. Moreover, most of these inserts were found to encode
defective env genes when analyzed in the T7-based transient-
expression system. Using amplification products from three
different subtype B isolates and multiple rounds of ligation and
transformation, we finally identified one clone from one isolate
(92US657.1) to contain a complete tat-rev-env cassette with an
intact envelope open reading frame (compare Table 2). Nu-
cleotide sequence analysis confirmed the integrity of env, tat,
and rev genes but also revealed a frameshift mutation in vpu
(data not shown). These results indicate that PCR amplifica-
tion of tat-rev-env cassettes from HIV-1 isolates is possible in

sures for inserts with defective open reading frames, this ap-

DISCUSSION
A panel of functional envelope constructs representing
HIV-1 sequence subtypes A through G. The HIV sequence
database currently contains over 750 envelope sequences from
individual HIV-1 strains, almost all of which represent group
M viruses (71). The great majority of these comprise small
subgenomic regions (generally less than 500 bp in length)
which have been generated for subtype classification or studies
of V3 loop amino acid variation (39). Most full-length env
sequences have been generated for subtype B viruses, although
there is generally very little information concerning the bio-
logical activity of their gene products. For non-subtype B vi-
ruses, 35 full-length env sequences have been deposited in the
database (71). Only five of these are known to express func-
tional glycoproteins, since they are derived from replication-
competent proviruses (NDK, Z2Z6, SF170, ELI, and MAL).
Two of these (NDK and Z2Z6) were cloned from T-cell-
adapted isolates following prolonged in vitro culture (71, 94).
A third (MAL) was shown to represent an intersubtype recom-
binant (49, 82, 83). Thus, there are currently only two full-
length and functional env genes available from PBMC-propa-
gated viruses which group in clades other than subtype B.
These are SF170 from subtype A (71) and ELI from subtype D
(2).
Because the products of the HIV-1 envelope gene are prime
targets of ongoing vaccine development efforts, we generated a
panel of genetically diverse env constructs from 35 primary
HIV-1 isolates collected at major epicenters of the current
AIDS pandemic. Sixteen isolates were derived from geograph-
ically diverse subtype B infections and included viruses from
North and South America as well as Asia. The other 19 were
selected from international vaccine evaluation sites and repre-
sented all major subtypes of HIV-1 group M (Table 1). Enve-
lope genes were amplified by PCR from short-term PBMC
cultures, transiently expressed to ensure integrity of their open
reading frames, and sequenced in their entirety. Phylogenetic
analysis was used to confirm their subtype classification and to
examine full-length gp160 sequences for evidence of recombi-
nation. Most importantly, however, envelope genes were as-
sessed for biological activity in the context of HIV-1 virions by
using an in trans complementation assay that examines enve-
lope glycoprotein function at all stages of the virus life cycle
(11, 25, 56, 95). Using this approach, we identified 20 envelope
genes, including at least one from each subtype (or recombi-
nant), to encode fully functional glycoproteins (Table 2). These
constructs thus represent a unique set of reagents that should
be useful both for basic and applied studies of HIV-1 envelope
glycoprotein structure, function, and immunogenicity.
Intersubtype recombination.We also examined whether any
of the HIV-1 isolates analyzed in this study represented an
intersubtype recombinant. Indeed, detailed phylogenetic anal-
yses of full-length gp160 sequences revealed that several vi-
ruses contained mosaic env genes. The most clear-cut example
was 93BR019, which represents a B/F recombinant (Fig. 5). In
addition, subtype G and E viruses exhibited discordant branch-
ing orders, clustering in subtype A in the 39 half of their gp41
coding regions (because the E/A and G/A recombination
breakpoints remain tentative, we have not changed the nomen-
clature of subtype ‘‘E’’ and ‘‘G’’ viruses; however, we indicate
their mosaic nature in quotation marks in figures and tables).
These results thus confirm our previous findings of the rela-
tively frequent occurrence of intersubtype recombination in
geographic areas where multiple subtypes of HIV-1 cocirculate
(82, 83). In a recent survey of all near-full-length gag or env
sequences in the database, we found that approximately 10%
originated from probable recombinant viruses (83). We have
identified a similar fraction of mosaic sequences among the
newly characterized HIV-1 isolates in this independent data
set. Moreover, in contrast to our previous study, we could now
confirm the presence of one of these recombinants in primary
uncultured patient material. These results thus indicate that
intersubtype recombinants are generated and can be expected
to increase in frequency in populations that experience epi-
demic spread and intermixing of different sequence subtypes.
Two major clades of HIV-1 (subtypes B and E) are currently
circulating in Thailand (44, 58, 76, 99). Members of one of
these (subtype E) have long been known to branch inconsis-
tently in phylogenetic trees derived from different parts of their
genome. These viruses cluster as a distinct group in env but fall
into subtype A in their gag region (58, 90). This observation,
along with our recent finding that mosaic sequences are much
more frequent than previously thought (83), led us to conclude
that ‘‘subtype E’’ viruses most probably represent A/E recom-
binants. However, it has been suggested that the discordant
branching orders may be an artifact of unequal evolutionary
rates in env and gag gene sequences. Two different scenarios
would be consistent with this assumption. One possibility
would be that subtype E viruses are actually members of sub-

type A but that they have evolved faster in their envelope
coding region and thus branch as a distinct group in env-
derived trees. However, to explain this possibility, one would
have to assume a much increased rate of evolution, and it
would not be sufficient that the changes be merely divergent, or
else the viruses would simply fall within subtype A but have
very long branches (as is seen, for example, for viruses that
have been subject to G-to-A hypermutation). Another possi-
bility would be that the env trees actually reflect the true
phylogenetic position of these viruses but that their gag gene
sequences have evolved in such a way that they now cluster in
subtype A. Because the positions of subtype E viruses in gag
and env trees are so different (71, 90), this would require an
extraordinarily large fraction of gag substitutions to be conver-
gent on subtype A. In either case, the extent of convergent
change would be unprecedented. Given these considerations, it
thus seems far more likely that subtype E viruses are indeed
intersubtype (A/E) recombinants. Our present finding of sub-
type A-like sequences in the 39 half of the subtype E gp41
coding region is consistent with this hypothesis.
The example of the Thai A/E viruses also raises the possi-
bility that certain ‘‘subtypes’’ initially designated on the basis of
partial sequences are composed entirely of recombinant vi-
ruses. All subtype E viruses so far analyzed appear to have
arisen from a single initial A/E recombinant ancestor, presum-
ably generated in central Africa, where viruses classified as A
and E coexist. The viral lineage giving rise to subtype E must
have existed separately for some time to accumulate the
amount of divergence from other viruses now seen in subtype
E env sequences. However, it is quite possible that the true
subtype E lineage has become extinct and that the only evi-
dence of this subtype remaining is in the descendants of the
A/E recombinant. Our recent finding that a ‘‘subtype E’’ pro-
virus from the Central African Republic exhibits a pattern of
mosaicism indistinguishable from Thai A/E recombinants is
consistent with this hypothesis (18).
Finally, it is important to note that both subtype G viruses
characterized in this study contain mosaic env genes. Although
most of their env coding region (including all of gp120 and the
exterior portion of gp41) falls into subtype G, sequences in the
39 half of their gp41 domain cluster in subtype A. This discor-
dant branching order was significant for both 92UG975 and
92RU131, as well as for a third virus (LBV21-7) from the
database (Fig. 6). Although we cannot define the recombina-
tion crossover points with certainty, primarily because of lack
of sufficient subtype G sequences in the database, our prelim-
inary data would suggest that they are near the membrane-
spanning domain and possibly at the same location in all three
viruses.
Biological characterization of PCR-derived envelope clones.
Previous reports have relied on sequence analysis (53) and in
some instances transient glycoprotein expression (19) as a
means to identify potentially functional env clones. However,
as shown in this study, inspection of the deduced env amino
acid sequence, even after documentation of protein expres-
sion, is not sufficient to reliably predict glycoprotein biological
activity. For example, clones 91HT652.11 and 93BR020.17
contained no alterations in the numbers or positions of cys-
teine residues, no unusual codon insertions or deletions, no
unexpected changes in N-linked glycosylation sites, and no
premature truncations. Nevertheless, these clones yielded only
very weak activity in the CAT complementation assay. By con-
trast, clones 93MW965.26 and 93TH976.17 yielded CAT con-
version rates comparable to that of the positive HXB2 control
(Fig. 7), although both contained unpaired cysteine residues in
their deduced amino acid sequence expected to give rise to an
inappropriately folded glycoprotein (Fig. 3). Finally, in vitro
translation and transient expression demonstrated that HIV-1
envelope glycoproteins can vary considerably in size and car-
bohydrate content (Fig. 8). Consequently, constructs with pre-
mature gp41 truncations can go unrecognized when analyzed
only for glycoprotein precursor size in transient-expression
studies. These results thus indicate that the biological activity
of PCR-derived envelope constructs has to be confirmed in the
context of infectious HIV-1 virions.
Primary HIV-1 isolates (in contrast to T-cell-adapted
strains) are notoriously difficult to neutralize, which is most
probably due to a relative inaccessibility of neutralization
epitopes on the surface of their oligomeric envelope glycopro-
tein complex (65, 66, 101). It has thus been proposed that
HIV-1 has evolved to evade the host humoral immune re-
sponse by masking neutralization epitopes, although this may
also entail the loss of some replicative capacity as a result of a
concomitant reduction in CD4-binding affinity (63, 65, 95).
Our finding of envelope constructs with low to borderline ac-
tivity in the CAT complementation assay which lack amino
acid changes predictive of altered glycoprotein function (e.g.,
91HT652.11, 93BR020.17, 93MW959.18, and 93MW960.3) is
interesting in this context, since it confirms earlier reports of a
reduced infectious potential of the env gene products from
some primary viruses (95). Using the same in trans comple-
mentation assay, Sullivan et al. found that the env gene of
YU-2 resulted in only 4% CAT conversion (95), although it
was derived from a fully replication competent provirus (50).
By contrast, the envelope clone of another primary isolate,
89.6, yielded 77% CAT conversion (95). Given this degree of
variability, it is possible that the low activity of some of our
constructs represents a property intrinsic to the envelopes of
primary viruses (suboptimal transfection efficiencies can be
excluded, since all borderline-positive clones were analyzed in
multiple independent experiments). Alternatively, the ob-
served reduction in infectivity of some env complemented viri-
ons may be due to amino acid replacements arising from PCR
misincorporation or the amplification of a minor variant. For
example, the env gene of 92HT596.4 contains a mutation of the
cysteine residue that is located between V1 and V2. This en-
velope construct is very weakly positive in the CAT assay,
consistent with the finding that even substantial deletions and
alterations in the V1/V2 loop structures are functionally toler-
ated (102). However, it is unlikely that clone 4 represents the
most predominant viral form in the 92HT596 culture, since this
isolate replicated with an SI phenotype (compare Table 1).
Another example is clone 93TH975.15, which has an unusual
amino acid substitution in C3 in which one of two acidic resi-
dues (boldface type) known to be important for CD4 binding
(75) is altered (GGDP/LE in the HIV-1 consensus is changed
to GGDLK in 93TH975.15 [Fig. 3]). Future studies will have to
determine whether this env clone is representative of the pre-
dominant virus in the 93TH975 culture.
One other interesting finding was that clone 91US005.11,
which was derived from a patient with rapid CD4 cell decline
(78, 79), was strongly positive in the CAT complementation
assay although its gp41 was prematurely truncated (lacking 17
residues from the carboxy terminus). On the basis of previous
reports implicating the intracellular portion of gp41 in glyco-
protein transport, steady-state expression levels, packaging,
and early entry processes (11, 17, 28, 51, 55, 104), we expected
virions complemented with this envelope to exhibit relatively
poor infectivity. Instead, 91US005.11 resulted in CAT conver-
sion rates comparable to or higher than those of the positive
HXB2 control (Fig. 7). To explain this unusual phenotype, we
examined the deduced amino acid sequence of 91US005.11

more closely. Interestingly, this clone also contained an amino
acid substitution at position 721, where a tyrosine was replaced
by a cysteine (Y721C). LaBranche et al. recently demonstrated
that mutation of the corresponding tyrosine residue in SIVMAC
(Y723C) resulted in markedly increased expression of enve-
lope glycoprotein on the cell surface (46). Identical observa-
tions were made by Rowell et al., who expressed an HIV-1
envelope glycoprotein mutated in this same tyrosine residue
(Y707A) in a recombinant vaccinia virus (84). Most recently,
Sauter et al. demonstrated that this tyrosine residue, which is
highly conserved among all primate lentiviruses, is part of an
endocytosis signal which is responsible for the rapid internal-
ization of envelope molecules from the cell surface via clath-
rin-coated pits (89). In light of these reports, it seems likely
that the cysteine mutation in 91US005.11 would also result in
an increase of the amount of glycoprotein on the cell surface.
This, in turn, may compensate any potentially negative effect
that a truncated gp41 molecule may exert on viral infectivity
and replication. Studies are under way to investigate this pos-
sibility as well as the question whether the unusual clinical
presentation of patient 91US005, who exhibited an extremely
high virus load at the time of seroconversion (79) and rapid
CD4 T-cell decline over the period of several months (78), is
related to these observations.
Utility of the generated envelope clones. The availability of
envelope constructs with documented biological activity should
now facilitate efforts aimed at identifying biological and immu-
nological correlates of different sequence subtypes of HIV-1.
Functional envelope constructs will be useful for the genera-
tion of clade-specific antigens for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte anal-
yses, the construction of SIV-HIV chimeric proviruses for in
vivo studies in the macaque animal model (98), the generation
of recombinant poliovirus replicons (68, 80), and the genera-
tion of other subunit vaccines. The reagents described should
also facilitate mechanistic studies relating to the structure and
function relationships of envelope glycoproteins from primary
HIV-1 isolates. Using the same CAT complementation assay,
Sullivan et al. recently reported that the fusogenicity of enve-
lope glycoproteins from a few subtype B primary isolates can
be enhanced by the binding of soluble CD4 or certain human
monoclonal antibodies directed against the V3 loop or the
CD4-binding site-related epitopes (95). In an independent
study, Moore et al. found that the infectivity of some primary
isolates derived from several different subtypes (A to F and I)
can be enhanced by HIV-1-positive human sera, in an isolate-
dependent (but not serum-dependent) manner (42, 64).
Whether these observations are linked is not yet known. How-
ever, the envelope constructs described here will now allow the
dissection of fusion enhancement in env complementation and
infectivity assays. This, in turn, may reveal whether this phe-
nomenon represents a significant obstacle to the development
of AIDS vaccines that are based on the induction of humoral
immunity (63).
All envelope constructs have been submitted to the National
Institutes of Health Research and Reference Program, Be-
thesda, Md., and all sequences have been recorded in Gen-
Bank and are available on line through the Los Alamos data-
base. These reagents are thus available to interested
investigators and manufacturers involved in the development
and testing of HIV vaccines.
