Abstract
The activity of mammalian SWI/SNF–related chromatin
remodeling complexes is crucial for differentiation, develop-
ment, and tumor suppression. Cell cycle–regulating activ-
ities dependent on the complexes include induction of the
p21WAF1/CIP1 kinase inhibitor and repression of E2F-responsive
promoters. These responses are linked through effects on pRb
phosphorylation, but the direct role of the SWI/SNF–related
complexes in their regulation is not fully understood. Results
presented here reveal that the complexes are required for
regulation of a distinct pathway of proliferation control
involving repression of c-myc expression in differentiating
cells. This involves direct promoter targeting of the c-myc gene
by the complexes. Induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 is specifically
dependent on prior repression of c-myc , but repression of
E2F-responsive genes is dissociable from the regulation of
c-myc and p21WAF1/CIP1. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(3): 1289-93)
Introduction
The activity of mammalian SWI/SNF–related chromatin remod-
eling complexes is crucial for proper differentiation and develop-
ment. The complexes are required for activation of tissue-specific
genes and are also essential for repression of proliferation. Subunits
critical for proliferation control are recognized as important tumor
suppressors (reviewed in refs. 1, 2). The complexes contain a core
ATPase (either BRG1 or BRM) plus seven or more noncatalytic
subunits containing various DNA-binding and protein-binding
motifs that modulate the targeting and activity of the ATPase. The
stably associated noncatalytic components of the complex include
the ARID1A subunit (synonyms: p270, BAF250a, hOSA1, SMARCF1),
which is a member of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins
(3, 4). ARID1A is frequently deficient in tumor tissue samples and
is thus implicated in the tumor suppression function of the
complexes (5, 6). Depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
reveals that ARID1A is required for proper differentiation-
associated cell cycle arrest, whereas a broadly expressed, inde-
pendently encoded, alternative subunit ARID1B (7) is not required
for this function (8). Monitoring the ARID1A subunit thus enables
analysis of a specific subset of complexes linked with cell cycle
arrest, permitting a more direct analysis of this function than
previously possible. A proper understanding of the role of the
complexes in tumor suppression requires identification of the
critical target promoters through which the complexes restrict
proliferation. This question has been addressed mostly through
study of the BRG1 and BRM ATPases and of the noncatalytic
subunit INI1 (synonyms: SMARCB1, hSNF5, BAF47), deficiency
of each of which is linked with loss of cell cycle control and
tumorigenesis.
Efforts to identify direct targets of the cell cycle arrest function of
the mammalian SWI/SNF–related complexes have focused on
repression of cyclins and activation of cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors, particularly p21WAF1/CIP1 (e.g., refs. 9–11; reviewed in
ref. 2). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have identified
one or more of the INI1, BRG1, or BRM subunits at the cyclin D,
cyclin E, and cyclin A promoters (12–15). Induction of the cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 occurs upon ectopic
expression of BRG1 and is also dependent on INI1 expression
(9, 10). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have shown
the presence of BRG1 at the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter during activation
(10, 16). ARID1A depletion in differentiating cells likewise results in
impaired induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and failed repression of E2F-
responsive promoters (8). Studies described here add cdc2 and
cyclin B2 to the list of E2F-responsive promoters identified as
direct targets of the complexes and show that the ARID1A subunit
is present on these promoters specifically upon differentiation.
Parallel examination of the p21WAF1/CIP1promoter yielded the un-
expected result that ARID1A does not target this promoter directly
during activation. This selective focus on ARID1A targets, distinct
from the more promiscuous range of BRG1 targets, leads here to
the realization that the c-myc promoter is a critical direct target
of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes during differentiation. Repres-
sion of c-myc , dependent on the complexes, is a required upstream
event in the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1. Genetic analysis of these
pathways shows further that ARID1A-containing complexes are
required independently for repression of the E2F-responsive genes.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines, cell culture, DNA, RNA, and protein analysis. Conditions
and reagents for culture and differentiation (by addition of ascorbic acid
and h-glycerol phosphate to normal culture medium) of low-passage
murine calvarial MC3T3-E1 cells, as well as the generation of the p270/
ARID1A knockdown lines (series MC.p270.KD) from parental MC3T3-E1
cells, and the integrity of the complexes in the absence of the ARID1A
subunit have been described previously (8). The previous work described
three independent lines with reproducible phenotypes. Experiments shown
here were done with the AA2 and CA6 lines. Preparation of samples for
Western blotting and the RNA blots and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase probe were described previously, as was the protocol for
the 3H-thymidine incorporation (DNA synthesis) assay (8).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Chromatin immunoprecipi-
tation assays were done with the EZ ChIP system (Upstate Cell Signaling
Solutions, Lake Placid, NY), according to manufacturer’s directions.

Virus infection. The generation and culture of the E1A-inactivated 9S
adenovirus (used here as a negative control) and of the c-myc expression
virus have been described previously (8, 17). MC3T3-E1 cells were infected
at a multiplicity of infection of 25 plaque-forming units per cell.
Results and Discussion
Promoter association of ARID1A during differentiation.
ARID1A stable knockdown lines were constructed in the MC3T3-E1
preosteoblast cell line. These nontransformed cells were chosen as
a model system because upon exposure to differentiation medium,
they undergo a tightly regulated and well-characterized progres-
sion through cell cycle arrest and into tissue-specific gene
expression (e.g., refs. 8, 18). In addition, comprehensive gene
expression profiles are available for each stage of differentiation
(19). Generation of the ARID1A knockdown lines (the MC.p270.KD
series) and their inability to withdraw from the cell cycle normally
during differentiation by induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and repression
of cell cycle specific products, such as cdc2 and cyclin B2, have
been described previously (8). Illustration of ARID1A expression in
a representative knockdown line is shown in Fig. 1A .
To confirm that the phenotype of the stable knockdown lines is
solely a result of targeting ARID1A, the phenotype was tested
further here using three different ARID1A-targeted siRNA sequen-
ces in a transient assay under puromycin selection. As seen
previously, p21WAF1/CIP1 is induced in parental cells in response to
the differentiation signal (Fig. 1B , lane 2 compared with lane 1).
Puromycin-selected parental cells behave the same way (lane 3).
The ARID1A knockdown line fails to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 in these
conditions (lanes 4 and 5 ). Transient transfection of the
knockdown sequence used to generate the stable lines yields the
same result: failure to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 (lane 9). Either of two
other independent ARID1A-targeted sequences again yields the
same result (lanes 7 and 8). Transfection of a scrambled sequence
has no effect (lane 6). Induction of differentiation is accompanied
by repression of cdc2 and cyclin B2. Repression fails in the ARID1A-
knockdown line (lanes 4 and 5) and in cells transiently transfected
with any of the three ARID1A-targeted siRNA sequences (lanes 7-9).
A probe for ARID1A levels confirms the effectiveness of the
knockdown sequences in the transiently transfected cells. The
transient transfection assay was also used to verify the DNA
synthesis phenotype of the knockdown lines. We have shown
previously that induction in parental cells results in a 7-fold
decrease in DNA synthesis activity by day 4, whereas ARID1A-
depleted cells maintain activity at a high level (8). The same
difference is seen here between the parental and knockdown lines
assayed at day 3 (Fig. 1C , samples 1 and 2) and between cells
transiently transfected with any of the three knockdown sequences
compared with cells transfected with a scrambled sequence
(samples 3-6). We conclude that the phenotype observed in the
stable knockdown lines is a specific result of ARID1A depletion.
ARID1A-specific monoclonal antibodies were used here in
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to monitor the specific
presence of this subunit at various promoters in differentiating
MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 2A). Association of ARID1A with the cdc2 or
cyclin B2 promoters is not detectable on chromatin prepared from
exponentially growing cells (day 0); however, ARID1A is clearly
present on both the cdc2 and cyclin B2 promoters in differentiating
cells (day 4). These results increase the number of E2F-responsive
promoters identified as direct targets of the complexes and show
the specific presence of the ARID1A subunit at a time when these
genes are repressed.
Parallel analysis of association of ARID1A with the p21WAF1/CIP1
promoter (Fig. 2A) revealed association in exponentially growing
cells (day 0) but not in differentiating cells (day 4). This was entirely
unexpected because whereas it suggests that ARID1A-containing
complexes may play a direct role in suppression of the p21WAF1/CIP1
promoter before differentiation, it indicates no direct role for
ARID1A-containing complexes in induction of p21WAF1/CIP1,
although ARID1A is required for normal induction. This result also
stands in potential contrast to detection of ectopically expressed
Figure 1. Phenotype of ARID1A/p270 knockdown cells. A, depletion of
ARID1A levels in the knockdown line compared with parental MC3T3-E1 cells is
shown by Western blot. Levels of the BAF155 and BAF170 subunits are
shown for comparison. B, a stable ARID1A knockdown line (MC.p270.KD),
or parental cells transfected with plasmids containing ARID1A-specific siRNA
sequences or a scrambled siRNA sequence, were cotransfected with a
puromycin selection plasmid (pMSCV). Cells were selected in 4 mg/mL
puromycin. Transfected cells were induced to differentiate at 24 hours after
transfection and assayed at day 3 after induction. The RNAi-7182 sequence
has been reported previously (8). The ARID1A-specific portion of the
RNAi-6751 sequence is CTCAGCATCCAGGACAACA, and of the RNAi-7055
sequence is CTAGTGTGGACATGATGCG. The scrambled sequence is
CCTCCAATCTTCGCGCGTC. Antibody sources have been described
previously (8). C, cells, transfected as described in (B ), were assayed at day 3
after induction for incorporation of 3H-thymidine. All samples were plated in
triplicate. Columns, average counts per minute (CPM) per sample; bars, SD.

BRG1 on the promoter during p21WAF1/CIP1 activation in human
tumor cells (9, 10). To resolve the latter discrepancy, the presence of
other SWI/SNF complex subunits on the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter was
probed before and during activation. An antibody reactive with the
ubiquitous subunits BAF155 and BAF170 indicates the presence of
a version of the complex at both times (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Probing
with antibodies individually specific for BRG1 and INI1 indicates the
presence of these subunits as well (lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the pattern
of ARID1A association does not conflict with results indicating the
presence of the BRG1 ATPase at an active p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter.
However, the dynamics of association specifically by the ARID1A
subunit raise an essential question about the required role of
ARID1A-containing complex assemblies in the activation of
p21WAF1/CIP1. If their role in activation is not direct, perhaps their
direct function is to repress a repressor of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression.
c-myc promoter is a direct target of mammalian SWI/SNF
complexes during differentiation. In recent years, c-myc has
been identified as a repressor of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in several
cell types, apparently acting by interfering directly with the Sp1/3
transcription factors (reviewed in ref. 20). Gene array analysis
indicates that c-myc is sharply down-regulated in MC3T3-E1 cells
between day 0 and day 3 of differentiation (19), and ectopic
expression of BRG1 in human tumor cells can cause c-myc down-
regulation (9). We therefore investigated the possibility that a direct
role of ARID1A-containing complexes in activation of p21WAF1/CIP1
is repression of c-myc . Western blots confirm the gene array
results at the protein level, showing that c-myc levels fall sharply
in the parental MC3T3-E1 cells upon differentiation (day 4 and
later); this response is greatly impaired in ARID1A-depleted cells
(MC.p270.KD; Fig. 3A). The inability of ARID1A-depleted cells to
repress c-myc levels was confirmed in a transient assay with
the three different RNA interference sequences described above
(Fig. 3B, lanes 7-9). We also verified that the effect of ARID1A
depletion on c-myc is manifested at the RNA level (Fig. 3C).
These results indicate that repression of c-myc is indeed dependent
on the activity of SWI/SNF–related complexes and specifically on
complexes that contain ARID1A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays were done to determine whether the c-myc promoter is a
direct target of the complexes. The results support the prediction
that ARID1A-containing complexes act directly to repress c-myc
during differentiation: association with the c-myc promoter is not
detected in exponentially growing cells but is clearly apparent in
differentiating cells (Fig. 3D, lane 3 , compare days 0 and 4). Probes
with antibodies reactive with the BAF155/170, BRG1, or INI1
subunits (Fig. 3D, lanes 4-6) indicate the consistent presence of a
version of the complex on the c-myc promoter, much as was seen
on the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter. This is not surprising because the
remodeling activity of the complexes is believed to contribute to
both activation and repression of highly regulated promoters. The
overall results suggest, however, that probing for ubiquitous
complex components may not always be sufficiently discriminating
to reveal functional aspects of promoter association.
Repression of c-myc is critical for p21WAF1/CIP1 activation,
whereas regulation of E2F-responsive gene products is inde-
pendent of c-myc and p21WAF1/CIP1 levels. The simplest interpre-
tation of these results is that ARID1A-containing complexes are
required directly for repression of c-myc during differentiation, and
that repression of c-myc is, in turn, required for activation of
p21WAF1/CIP1. However, none of these observations proves that
repression of c-myc is an actual prerequisite for p21WAF1/CIP1
activation in this system. To address this question, c-myc was

expressed in the MC3T3-E1 cells using a constitutively active c-myc
construct encoded in an adenovirus vector, Ad-cMyc (17). Parental
MC3T3-E1 cells infected with Ad-cMyc or a negative control
adenovirus, Ad-9S, were harvested at days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after
induction and assayed by Western blot for expression of c-myc and
p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig. 4A). The Western blots verify the maintenance of
high levels of c-myc in induced cells infected with Ad-cMyc,
compared with the decreasing level seen in cells infected only with
the control virus Ad-9S (1). Probing the same lysates for p21WAF1/CIP1
shows that maintenance of a high level of c-myc is sufficient to
block completely the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig. 4A, 2). Thus,
repression of c-myc is indeed a necessary event in p21WAF1/CIP1
activation. These results do not exclude a conclusion that the

hours before the time of ascorbic acid induction with an adenovirus vector

after induction. Levels of c-myc, p21, cdc2, cyclins B2 and A, and hsc70
(included as a loading control) were probed by Western blotting. Ectopic
expression of c-myc does not result in higher expression levels at early times,
presumably because autoregulation represses endogenous levels. B, cells

p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter is also a direct target of the complexes during
induction. The positive signals seen with other subunits (refs. 9, 10;
Fig. 2B) confirm that it is. However, the results described here
identify direct targeting of the c-myc promoter by the SWI/SNF–
related complexes, specifically by the ARID1A-containing subset of
complexes, as a critical upstream event in the pathway leading to
induction p21WAF1/CIP1 in differentiating cells.
Another question raised by these observations is whether ectopic
expression of c-myc is sufficient to prevent repression of E2F-
responsive promoters. To address this question, additional aliquots
of the virus-infected cell lysates were probed for expression levels
of proteins produced from characteristic E2F-responsive genes. For
each protein analyzed (cdc2, cyclin B2, and cyclin A), the result was
the same. Ectopic expression of c-myc and the concomitant failure
of p21WAF1/CIP1 induction does not affect repression of the E2F-
responsive promoters (Fig. 4A, 3, 4 , and 5). Repression of the E2F-
responsive gene products is not a downstream event dependent on
c-myc repression nor on p21WAF1/CIP1 activation. Previous results
showing that constitutive expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 is not
sufficient for repression of E2F-responsive promoters in the
absence of ARID1A (8) emphasize further that induction of
p21WAF1/CIP1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for repression of
the E2F-responsive promoters.
The degree of regulation remaining in the induced cells in the
presence of constitutively high levels of c-myc is sufficient not just
for repression of E2F-responsive gene products but also for
shutdown of DNA synthesis, as shown by the kinetics of 3H-
thymidine incorporation (Fig. 4B). Previous results showed that
ectopic expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 in the absence of ARID1A
(which can now be understood as bypassing the need for c-myc
repression) is not sufficient for repression of E2F-responsive genes
but is sufficient to reduce DNA synthesis to <10% of proliferating
cell levels; the same cells infected with a negative control virus
maintain incorporation at >85% of proliferating levels (8). Together,
these results illustrate a dual level of control present in normal cells
(summarized in Fig. 4C). The phenotype of the ARID1A-depleted
cells, by revealing the dependence of c-myc repression on the
complexes, sheds further light on the extent to which proliferation
controls are dependent on the functions of SWI/SNF complexes.
Rapid down-regulation of c-myc has been seen previously
following exposure to differentiation inducers (reviewed in ref. 20),
and constitutive expression of c-myc is sufficient to block
induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 in other cell types (e.g., ref. 17; reviewed
in ref. 20). However, the finding that the SWI/SNF complexes are
required for repression of c-myc during differentiation illuminates
an important new aspect of their role in tumor suppression. This
study also highlights functional differences between subsets of
the SWI/SNF–related complexes. It is important to recognize that
the entity typically designated the mammalian SWI/SNF complex,
sometimes called the BAF complex, is actually a small series of
related complexes of variable composition resulting from the
presence in most cells of alternative versions of the ATPase
subunits and of the ARID family subunits. The ATPase subunits
are not interchangeable, but they do show considerable overlap of
function (reviewed in refs. 1, 2). The ARID family subunits confer
very specific functional differences on the complexes. In particular,
the ARID1A subunit is a determinant of a specific subset that is
required for differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest and which
directly targets cell cycle–regulated genes, including c-myc, cdc2 ,
and cyclin B2 , specifically at the time of repression. The
significance of loss of ARID1A function to proliferation control in
normal cells during differentiation is profound, impairing each of
two major pathways of growth regulation.
