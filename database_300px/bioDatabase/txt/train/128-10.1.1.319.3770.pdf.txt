Abstract
In this series of projects of sequencing human cDNA clones which correspond to relatively long tran-
scripts, we newly determined the entire sequences of 100 cDNA clones which were screened on the basis
of the potentiality of coding for large proteins in vitro. The cDNA libraries used were the fractions with
average insert sizes from 5.3 to 7.0 kb of the size-fractionated cDNA libraries from human brain. The
randomly sampled clones were single-pass sequenced from both the ends to select clones that are not
registered in the public database. Then their protein-coding potentialities were examined by an in vitro
transcription/translation system, and the clones that generated proteins larger than 60 kDa were entirely
sequenced. Each clone gave a distinct open reading frame (ORF), and the length of the ORF was roughly
coincident with the approximate molecular mass of the in vitro product estimated from its mobility on
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The average size of the cDNA clones sequenced was 6.1 kb, and
that of the ORFs corresponded to 1200 amino acid residues. By computer-assisted analysis of the sequences
with DNA and protein-motif databases (GenBank and PROSITE databases), the functions of at least 73%
of the gene products could be anticipated, and 88% of them (the products of 64 clones) were assigned
to the functional categories of proteins relating to cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid managing,
and cell structure/motility. The expression profiles in a variety of tissues and chromosomal locations of
the sequenced clones have been determined. According to the expression spectra, approximately 11 genes
appeared to be predominantly expressed in brain. Most of the remaining genes were categorized into one of
the following classes: either the expression occurs in a limited number of tissues (31 genes) or the expression
occurs ubiquitously in all but a few tissues (47 genes).

than 60 kDa were entirely sequenced. Each clone gave a
distinct open reading frame (ORF), and the length of
the ORF was roughly coincident with the approximate
molecular mass of the in vitro product estimated from
its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE). The sequences of the predicted proteins were
computer searched against the databases of protein pri-
mary structures and motifs, and the function of 73% of
the gene products could be anticipated from annotations
of known entries in the databases.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. The source and screening of cDNA clones
cDNA clones were randomly selected from fractions
4 to 6 (average insert size = 5.3, 6.1, and 7.0 kb) of
the size-fractionated cDNA libraries from human brain
previously constructed.2 All the clones were subjected to
single-pass sequencing from both the ends using M13 for-
ward and reverse primers. The terminal sequences were
computer searched using the MPSRCH program3 against
a subset of the GenBank database (release 93.0) which
contained primate DNA sequences but no expression se-
quence tags (ESTs), and those with scores of lower than
250 were categorized "unregistered." The coding poten-
tiality of cDNA clones carrying unregistered sequences
at both the ends were examined using in vitro transcrip-
tion/translation analysis.2 Prestained protein size mark-
ers (molecular masses from 202 kDa to 6.9 kDa; Kalei-
doscope size markers from Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA)
were used to estimate the apparent molecular masses of
the in vitro products. Since multiple discrete bands are
usually generated from a single clone (see Fig. 5 in ref. 2),
the size of the largest band was estimated, and the clones
gaving products larger than 60 kDa on SDS-PAGE were
entirely sequenced by methods described previously.
2.2. Similarity analysis of the predicted protein-coding
sequences
The entire cDNA sequences deduced were routinely
analyzed with the GCG software package.4 The simi-
larity of the predicted coding sequences to known ones
was examined using the FASTA program against the
non-redundant protein database, OWL (release 29.1),
and further checked by the GAP program. The motif
search was performed by the MOTIFS program using
the PROSITE database (release 13.0).
2.3. Expression profiles of the sequenced cDNA clones
The expression profiles of the cDNA clones sequenced
in various tissues were monitored by reverse transcrip-
tion followed by the polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR). The cDNA templates for RT-PCR were synthe-
sized from 1 jdg of human poly (A)+ RNA (CLON-
TECH Laboratories, Inc., USA) using excess amounts of
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL, USA)
and random hexamer primers. After synthesis of the
first-strand cDNA, the remaining RNA in the reaction
mixture was degraded with RNase A, and the result-
ing cDNA templates were recovered by phenol extrac-
tion followed by ethanol precipitation. An aliquot of the
cDNA template mixture [2 /A, corresponding to 1 ng of
the starting poly (A)+ RNA] was subjected to PCR us-
ing LA Taq DNA polymerase (0.5 units, Takara Shuzo
Co., Ltd., Japan) in 10 jA with the DNA Thermal Cycler
PJ9600 (Perkin Elmer, USA) and a set of primers spe-
cific to a gene of interest. As a positive control, a
primer set for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (G3PDH) gene was used. Unless otherwise stated,
the thermal cycling conditions used were as follows: The
first denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 0.5-min
denaturation at 95 °C, 0.5-min primer annealing at 55
°C, and 1-min polymerization at 72 °C; and the last ex-
tension at 72 °C for 6 min. To check the efficiencies
of PCR for individual genes, control reactions were con-
ducted in which the PCR products were generated from
serial dilutions of each cDNA clone (0.1 fg to 1 pg in 10 fA
PCR mixture). The whole PCR products were loaded
on 2.5% NuSieve GTG agarose gel (FMC BioProducts,
USA) and detected by fluorescent staining with ethidium
bromide. The gel images were recorded with a gel print
2000i/VGA (Biolmage, USA). The PCR primer sets spe-
cific to individual genes were identical to those used for
radiation hybrid mapping.
2.4- Chromosomal location
The cDNA clones entirely sequenced were mapped
along chromosomes by using the GeneBridge 4 radia-
tion hybrid panel (Research Genetics, Inc., USA). The
details of the experimental conditions for the radia-
tion hybrid mapping of respective clones are described
elsewhere. The software for analysis of the results of
the panel was obtained via ftp at ftp://genome.wi.mit.
edu/distribution/software/rhmapper/.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Sequence analyses and prediction of the protein-
coding regions of cDNA clones
Starting from the randomly sampled cDNA clones from
the size-fractionated cDNA libraries of human brain, the
clones to be sequenced were screened by the following
two steps:
(1) Selection of unidentified cDNA clones by comparison
of the single-pass sequences from both the ends with the
primate DNA sequences except for ESTs registered in the
database.
(2) selection of the clones encoding proteins larger than

60 kDa by analysis of the protein-coding potentiality
in vitro.
Approximately 80% of the randomly sampled clones
were sorted to the unregistered class, and approximately
20% of the non-redundant unregistered clones were found
to have the potentiality of coding for proteins larger than
60 kDa. The entire sequences of the finally selected clones
were deduced, and their sequence features were analyzed
by computer. In addition, the chromosomal mapping
of the sequenced clones using the radiation-hybrid panel
and analysis of their expression profiles in 14 different
tissues were performed. Physical maps of the 100 cDNA
clones analyzed are shown in Fig. 1, where the ORFs
and the first ATG codons in respective ORFs are indi-
cated by solid boxes and triangles, respectively. Table 1
lists the lengths of inserts, the ORF lengths, the appar-
ent molecular masses of the largest in vitro products for
respective cDNA clones, and the chromosomal locations
of the respective clones. The average size of the cDNA
inserts was 6.1 kb and that of the predicted ORFs corre-
sponded to 1200 amino acid residues. Although we listed
the bands of the molecular masses larger than 100 kDa
as > 100 kDa in Table 1 because of inaccuracy of the
estimation, the values deduced from their relative mobil-
ities on SDS-PAGE appeared to roughly coincide with
the length of ORFs within a range of estimation errors.
The result indicated that the selection of cDNA clones
based on analysis of the in vitro products works well and
eliminates those carrying short ORFs. The in-frame ter-
mination codons upstream of the first ATG codon were
identified in 49 clones, in which 34 clones carried the ATG
codon within the contexts of Kozak's rule: RNNATGG,
RNNATGY, and YNNATGG, where R and Y indicate
purine and pyrimidine residues, respectively, and ATG
codons are underlined. In Fig. 1, such ATG codons sur-
rounded by the contexts of Kozak's rule5 are shown by
solid triangles. In the remaining clones (51 clones), the
in-frame termination codons were not identified in the
5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), whereas distinct pro-
tein products were generated in the in vitro system. The
presence of in-frame termination codons in the 5'-UTR is
not necessary for the translation initiation, but the pos-
sibility remains that either the upstream UTR from the
first ATG codon has been truncated or initiation from the
internal ATG sites of the truncated or 5'-intron-retaining
clones was induced in the in vitro system.6
3.2. Functional classification of the predicted gene prod-
ucts
The gene products newly predicted were tentatively
sorted into the following six functional categories (1 to
6), and those of unclassified (7), and no clue (8) on the
basis of similarity to known proteins or protein motifs
linked to certain functions:
(1) Proteins relating to cell signaling and cell-cell com-
munication such as protein kinases, adhesion molecules,
receptors, and intracellular signal transducers (cell sig-
naling/communication) .
(2) Proteins relating to nucleic acid synthesis and its reg-
ulation such as transcription factors, helicases and splic-
ing factors (nucleic acid managing).
(3) Proteins relating to protein synthesis including mod-
ification and degradation enzymes (protein managing).
(4) Proteins relating to cell structure and motility in-
cluding cytoskeletons, membrane skeletons, extracellular
matrixes, motors (cell structure/motility).
(5) Proteins relating to cell division (cell division).
(6) Proteins relating to metabolisms (metabolism).
(7) Proteins not classified into above functional categories
and hypothetical proteins registered in databases (un-
classified) .
(8) Hypothetical proteins with no clue for functional clas-
sification (no clue).
The results of analysis are summarized in Table 2,
which lists the name of database files which gave the high-
est score in the similarity queries, the identity of amino
acid sequences and the sequence length from which the
identity was deduced. The overall degree of similarity
was also indicated by dividing them into nearly "iden-
tical" (> 90% to entries of human proteins), "homolo-
gous" (> 90% to non-human protein entries), "related"
(30-90% to any entries) and "weakly related" classes
(< 30% to any entries). Note that the identical class in-
cludes seven clones whose sequences were reported during
the preparation of this paper. The sequence comparison
of these clones with the reported proteins suggests that
some of the products were originated by alternative splic-
ing.
The distribution of the predicted gene products in the
six functional classes seems to be essentially in agreement
with that of the entries of large proteins (> 1000 amino
acid residues) in the database of human proteins. Other
sequence features noteworthy are summarized below.
1. Eleven out of 21 genes which were classified into
category 2 (nucleic acid managing) coded for DNA-
binding proteins carrying zinc finger motifs.
2. Only one gene (KIAA0361) was assigned to cate-
gory 6 (metabolism). Furthermore, this gene prod-
uct showed similarity to prokaryotic protein entries.
The rare occurrence of metabolic enzymes is consis-
tent with the search data of the large protein entries
in the database.2
3. The occurrence of receptors, channels and adhesion
proteins in the gene products assigned to category 1
(cell signaling/communication) appeared to be lower
than that expected from the large protein entries

146 Prediction of Unidentified Human Genes [Vol. 4,
in the database. This may be due to the fact that
such molecules of biological interest have been pref-
erentially investigated to date. On the other hand,
this study allowed us to identify seven gene prod-
ucts which are involved in the G-protein-mediated
signal transduction system. This value is consider-
ably high, compared with that in the large protein
entries in the database.
The complete sequence catalog of the protein compo-
nents in budding yeast is now available (non-redundant
6023 yeast protein sequences retrieved via ftp at
ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/yeast-ORFs).
Thus, the protein sequences predicted in this paper were
compared with those in this database, and only 4 genes
(KIAA0325, 0357, 0361 and 0389) were found to have
significant similarities to yeast proteins over the 50% re-
gion of the entire query sequences. As listed in Table 2,
three of them were motor proteins, dynein (KIAA0325
and 0357) and myosin (KIAA0389), which are known to
be highly conserved during the evolution of eukaryotic
organisms, and the remaining one (KIAA0361) was the
metabolic enzyme mentioned previously. We noted that
many of the gene products predicted in this paper car-
ried some sequences which showed significant similarities
to yeast proteins but the lengths of the similarity regions
were short relative to the query sequences. As far as
the protein sequences reported here are concerned, the
counterparts of at least 96% of the human gene products
appear to be absent in the unicellular eukaryotic organ-
ism.
3.3. Expression profiles of the predicted genes
The steady-state levels of individual mRNAs in 14 dif-
ferent tissues were analyzed by the RT-PCR method.
To examine the fidelity of this method, we compared
the expression patterns using three representative genes,
which exhibited ubiquitous, tissue-specific and very low
expression patterns by Northern analysis (lower panels
in Fig. 2A, B, and C). As shown in the upper panels of
Fig. 2A, B, and C, the RT-PCR method produces expres-
sion patterns comparable to those by Northern analysis.
The result also demonstrated that the sensitivity of the
former method is higher than that of the latter under
the conditions employed. The possibility of generating
PCR products from contaminated genomic DNA in the
original poly (A)+ RNA preparations was excluded by
PCR with a primer set from split exons and also by an
experiment in which the reverse transcription step was
omitted.
The quantitative measurement of mRNA levels by RT-
PCR, however, requires careful control experiments for
each gene, because the quantifiable range of RT-PCR is
relatively narrow, and the efficiency of amplification is
significantly influenced by the sequences of the primer

expression was analyzed as a positive control. In each set of electrophoretic patterns, lanes 1 to 5 show the PCR products derived
from serial tenfold dilutions of a cDNA clone of interest (from 0.1 fg to 1 pg, respectively) for the estimation of the PCR amplification
efficiency. Lanes 6 to 19 are electrophoretic patterns of the PCR products originated from mRNAs of 14 different tissues: lane 6,

150 Prediction of Unidentified Human Genes [Vol. 4,
son of the efficiency of PCR with the primer set for each
gene.
The expression profiles of individual transcripts in 14
different tissues are shown in Fig. 3. As mentioned above,
the efficiency of amplification by RT-PCR is influenced
by the primer sequences used — it is not possible to sim-
ply compare the band intensities among different genes
— but those obtained with the same primer set should
provide information on the mRNA levels in different tis-
sues. The expression profiles of the genes analyzed could
be categorized into the following classes: The genes pre-
dominantly expressed in brain (11 genes: KIAA0299,
0311. 0316, 0319, 0322, 0358, 0363, 0369, 0374, 0378, and
0390), the genes expressed in a limited number of tissues
(31 genes), and the genes which were expressed ubiqui-
tously in most tissues but which were not expressed at
all in a few tissues (47 genes). The proportion of genes
exhibiting the ubiquitous expression throughout the tis-
sues was fairly low (11 genes). This is in sharp contrast
to the genes previously identified with the cDNA libraries
of a human myeloid cell line KG-1, most of which showed
ubiquitous expression. As a control, the expression pro-
file of a typical ubiquitous gene, the G3PDH gene, is
shown at the bottom of Fig. 3. The sensitivity of detec-
tion by RT-PCR is much higher than that by Northern
analysis; therefore, the genes which were expressed only
in brain seem to be more strictly shut off in other tissues
when analyzed by RT-PCR.
The actual primer sequences used for PCR are
available through the World Wide Web at http:
