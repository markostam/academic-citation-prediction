The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
continues to spread unchecked since its first
documentation in 1981. Two decades later, nearly 50
million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS world
wide, according to figures released by the Joint United
Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the
World Health Organization (WHO)1. There are two
types of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
responsible for this infection/disease. A major
proportion of the infection worldwide is caused by
the HIV-1 virus, which was identified in 19832,3. The
type 2 (HIV-2) virus was first detected in West Africa
and is significantly prevalent in those regions, Portugal
and India with rare cases reported from western
countries, Korea and Philippines4-10.
Since, the commencement of the AIDS epidemic
two decades ago, HIV-1 has evolved, differing from
one geographical location to another11. This variability
at the genomic level can be attributed to high
mismatch error rate of the HIV reverse transcriptase
(RT) enzyme coupled with the absence of proof
reading capacity, diploid genome, the rapid turnover
of the virus in vivo, viral fitness, immune response or

The phylogenic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the env gene has enabled classification
of HIV-1 into three groups. The group M of HIV-1 infection has been classified into 9 different
genetic subtypes A-K, with E and I being classified as circulating recombinants forms (CRFs).
The groups O and N are less frequently encountered in human infections. Presently group M of
HIV-1 globally causes 99.6 per cent of all human infections. The epidemiological trends suggest
that subtype C strains would dominate the HIV pandemic in the coming years. The geographic
spread of subtype C strains is also very diverse with prevalence in Africa, Latin America and
Asia. Data from India show a high prevalence of subtype C. In north and western India, 78.4 and
96 per cent of HIV-1 strains respecetively were shown to be subtype C. Among female sex
workers in Kolkata 95 per cent of the HIV-1 strains were subtype C. The south Indian subtype
data are very similar to the data from the rest of India. The HIV-2 groups (subtypes) recognized
are A-H. Unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 strains are predominantly found in Africa. The Indian HIV-2
strains identified till date are subtype A. This is also the predominant strain circulating in
western African countries. This group (subtype) is estimated to cause 0.11 per cent of all HIV
infections in humans.

therapeutic selection pressures and recombination
events that are taking place during replication. It has
been reported that HIV-1 RT has an average error
rate of 1/1700 per detectable nucleotide
incorporation11-16. Further, certain regions of the
genome are mutational hotspots with an error rate as
high as 1 per 70 nucleotides12. As a result when the
nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 is analyzed, a great deal
of heterogeneity is observed. The most notable
manifestation of HIV-1 genetic diversity is the
phylogenetic clustering of viral isolates worldwide
referred to as clades or subtypes based on the 20-50
per cent differences in envelope (env) nucleotide
sequences. The inherent diversity of HIV-1 is
compounded by three separate introduction of the virus
from chimpanzees to humans17,18. Due to this reasons,
there are now three groups of HIV-1: M (Major/Main),
N (Non-M, Non-O/New) and O (Outlier). The env
proteins of group M and O can show a variation as
much as 30-50 per cent. The N subtype appears to be
phylogenetically equidistant from M and O11.
The M group is the most prevalent among the three
groups. It now has nine subtypes (A-D, F-H, J, K),
all of which have originated from Central Africa. The
amino acid distances in the env gene between the
subtypes in the major group have reached 25-35 per
cent, while in the gag gene it is about 15 per cent18.19.
Within subtypes A and F, there are separate sub-
clusters that are related closely to each other than to
other subtypes. They are designated A1, A2 and F1,
F2 respectively18. Within subtypes B, C and G there
are geographically localized sub-clusters that share a
common ancestry as suggested in phylogenetic trees:
subtype B from Thailand20, subtype C from India21
and Ethiopia22, and subtype G from Spain and Portugal
(Table I)18.23.
Majority of the HIV-1 strains analyzed till date
are subtyped. However, there are a few HIV-1 strains
with genomes having regions represented from
different subtypes (recombinants) seen in geographic
areas where more than one type is circulating. This
recombinant status is reinforced by the finding that
irrespective of the regions of their genome analyzed
they fail the criteria of a single designated subtype.
These ‘hybrid strains’ are the products of recombinant
events taking place in the virus. If two different
subtypes of HIV-1 infect a single cell, following
replication the result can be a mosaic genome
comprising regions from each of the two subtypes.
This is due to the “template switching” ability of the
reverse transcriptase enzyme. Two types of
recombinant forms have been identified - circulating
recombinant forms (CRF) and the unique recombinant
forms (URF)18.
If the recombinant is identified in at least three
epidemiologically unlinked individuals characterized
by full-length genome sequencing, they are designated
CRFs. Three near full-length genomic sequences are
preferred, but two complete genomes in conjunction
with partial sequences of a third strain are sufficient
(for CRF, the partial sequences must also confirm
the CRFs mosaic structure)24. There are currently
16 recognized CRFs25. Most of the CRFs are
described from Africa, though 5 have originated
outside of Africa18. The formerly designated subtypes
E and I are now reclassified as CRFs26. In addition
to CRF, several HIV-1 strains with unique mosaic
structures have been reported in epidemiologically
linked persons.  These forms known as unique
recombinant forms (URF) have not show any
evidence of epidemic spread and are thought to arise
due to secondary recombination of a CRF18. Currently
there are about 30 of  them27.
Though the sequence diversity within HIV-1 group
O is nearly as great as within group M, clades are not
clearly differentiated phylogenitically.  Hence,
subtypes within the HIV-1 O group are not yet defined.
Since not many group N strains have been sequenced,
no subtype has been determined till date.
Because of the high degree of divergence, the
homologous recombination between group M and O
viruses were not expected. Contrary to this, there
are recent reports of the intergroup recombinants
reported from Cameroon24,28.
Like HIV-1, phylogenetic clusters have also been
described for HIV-2. Phylogenetic analyses have
shown high degree of closeness between HIV-2 and
simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from sooty
mangabeys  (SIVsm)29-31. All the different subtypes
described are considered to have arisen by
335
independent cross-species transmission from sooty
mangabey to human transmission events and belong
to different lineages17. Hence these subtypes are
analogous to the groups described for HIV-117.
Currently there are 8 subtypes (groups) identified and
designated as A to H32-35. Among these 8 groups, A
and B are circulating in the human population and
C-H represent only few unique infections. Hence,
there is a proposal to call A and B as groups and C-H
as putative-groups35.
The present drive in the area of HIV prevention
includes the attempts at vaccine development. The
most cost effective control measures would be social
intervention to prevent transmission and a
prophylactic vaccine. The development of a
therapeutic vaccine will have a modest impact if it
achieves increased longevity of infected individiuals
with reduced viral loads in infected individuals
reducing the risk of such individuals as transmitters.
There are certain issues confronting HIV vaccine
development drive. These include: agreement on
measure of vaccine elicited protective responses,
impact of subtype variations and emergence of
recombinants. More evidence for cross-clade
cytotoxic lymphocytic responses is to be obtained as
this has implications for attempts at custom designed
region specific vaccines.
Significance of genotype determination
Impact on biological properties: The possibility that
HIV subtype may influence viral transmissibility and
pathogenicity has been suggested. However, results
of various studies have shown it extremely difficult
to find consistent associations between HIV-1
subtypes and correlates of transmission and
pathogenesis. Also, it seems unlikely that a single
characteristic such as subtype can account for
significant differences in transmission and disease
progression.
Data available from a study done in South Africa36
shows subtype B to be associated with male
homosexual transmission and subtype C with
heterosexual transmission.
In the context of disease progression subtypes A
and G have been associated with longer AIDS-free
survival period37. There are some striking differences
in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 between areas where
B subtype and non-B subtypes are prevalent. In
contrast to areas where subtype B is prevalent, rapid
progression to AIDS is seen in areas where non-B
subtypes are predominant15,38,39. However, Kaleebu
et al40 has shown the lack of association of subtypes
with disease progression in Uganda. In Uganda, an
area where HIV-1 subtypes A and D circulate, no
increase has been shown in the prevalence of one
subtype over the other for over a decade41.
Several reports have shown that viruses with
subtypes A, C or inter subtype recombinant long
terminal repeats (LTRs) are more likely to be
transmitted from mother to infant compared to viruses
with subtype D LTRs.  The transmission rates was
3.2 times more for subtype A, 4.8 times more for
inter subtypes and 6.1 times more likely to be for
subtype C43.
Impact on HIV testing: It is necessary for
commercially available assays to be able to diagnose
infections of all HIV-positive individuals including
those infected with less prevalent, more diverse
subtypes. Kits for diagnosis and monitoring HIV
infections were first developed for HIV-1 clade B
and initially not optimized for use with others.
Current assays used for detection of HIV-1 antibodies
can detect all subtypes of groups M and O as also
HIV-244.
The initial HIV amplification assays have
encountered problems during estimation of HIV-1
RNA for some non- B subtypes45. The newer
versions of these assays, which are in use today, have
been shown to reliably quantify HIV-1 RNA from
subtype A-G infections. However, variations in results
were seen during quantitation of group O. Primer
mismatch has been linked to the failure to quantify
viral load from group O infections by the AMPLICOR
HIV-1 Monitor version 1.5, which were however
detected by LCx HIV RNA Quantitative46.
Impact on antiviral resistance: A major obstacle to
the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral therapy is the
emergence of HIV-1 variants with reduced
susceptibility to antiretroviral agents47.  Genotypic
analyses of viruses of different clades have shown
KANDATHIL et al : MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV
336 INDIAN J MED RES, APRIL  2005
nucleotide change (silent mutations), polymorphisms
and secondary mutations within reverse transcriptase
and protease regions implicated in the emergence of
resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTIs), non- nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease
inhibitors (PIs) used in HIV-1 treatment. In treatment-
naïve patients, many of these changes are not
predicted to confer resistance to drugs among the
different clades. They may however facilitate the
development of resistance11. It is believed that some
of these pre-existing genetic polymorphisms may
accelerate the emergence of a few NNRTI resistance
mutations in certain HIV-1 non-B subtypes11.
In the absence of any drug exposure, protease
sequences from B and non-B HIV-1 are polymorphic
among 30 per cent of the protease gene coded amino
acids48. Some of these amino acid substitutions may
occur at high rates in non-subtype B viruses at
positions associated with drug resistance in subtype B.
Unlike HIV-1 group M, HIV-1 group O and HIV-2
are inherently resistant to NNRTI because of a base
substitution in the RT gene49,50.
Methodologies for genotype determination
There are a number of methods, to understand the
genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1 subtypes, the
reference method being sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis. This method not only determines the subtype
but also examines the relationship between a set of
sequences18. However, there are other methods that
are economically feasible and more accessible in the
developing world.
Heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) makes use
of the difference in electrophoretic mobility of a
heteroduplex formed between the amplified PCR
product of a sample and a reference strain to identify
genotypes51. HMA can employ different target
sequences with the gag and the env region (gp120)
being the preferred region. The env gp41 based HMA
is considered to be an useful tool to monitor subtypes
in countries with divergent strains of HIV-1. It
circumvents problems arising due to variation in
sequences as it targets a relatively conserved region52.
Hyendrickx et al53 have used a combination of gag/
env primers to detect recombinant strains of HIV-1
group M isolates.
Another well described and simple laboratory
method for the differentiation of HIV-1 subtypes is
the V3 serological sub-typing54-56. This method is
based on the binding of antibody to peptides from the
V3 loop of the envelope from different subtypes57.
Genotyping and serotyping have shown a good
correlation in areas where a single subtype
circulates58. Serotyping with the V3 peptide depends
on an immune response to an antigen coded by a very
small antigenic domain and thus a single amino acid
substitution can affect serotyping. By contrast,
genotypic methods are based on the analysis of a
much larger domain and are hence more specific.
Though simple, it is however not very practical in
areas where multiple subtypes co-circulate.  Further,
it is not reliable in differentiating subtype C and A59.
The V3 serological sub-typing results with HIV-2 are
of limited value, as these are inconsistent with the
genotyping result, especially since V3-A and V3-D
peptides, display poor discrimination. This also
reaffirmed the high level similarity between the V3
sequences of different HIV-2 subtypes60. The V3 loop
of the HIV-2 appears to be highly conserved whereas
the V2 region appears to be a highly variable region5.
Both heteroduplex mobility assay and serotyping
are useful techniques in areas where a single subtype
predominates. In areas where multiple subtypes co-
circulate, more than one genomic region will need to
be analyzed to rule out recombination. In such
circumstances the best technique is the sequencing
of whole genome. This technique is however labour-
intensive, time consuming and expensive.
Global scenario
HIV-1: All groups of HIV-1 are found in Africa.
While group M is prevalent all over the continent,
groups N and O are geographically restricted to
Central Africa15,61-63. Subtypes A and D are prevalent
in East Africa, subtype A in West Africa, and subtype
C in south Africa. In West and Central Africa, the
most prevalent genetic form is however a
recombinant virus CRF02_AG18. Subtype B is the
337
most prevalent form in western and central Europe,
the Americas and Australia. Subtype C is most
prevalent in the Indian subcontinent and recombinants
CRF01_AE and subtype B in South East Asia18.
Globally subtype C is the most predominant subtype
causing 47.2 per cent of infections26. Even in areas
that were traditionally non-C in nature, it is becoming
more predominant.  Subtype A and CRF02_AG was
estimated to be the second leading cause of the
pandemic (27%), followed by subtype B strains
(12.3%)26. To date, 16 CRFs of HIV subtypes have
been identified from different parts of the globe25
(Table II) and are spreading sub-epidemics in areas
where these strains have emerged.
Apart from these CRFs, unique recombinants have
also been described. Many AC and AD recombinants
are reported from Eastern African countries like
Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda and Kenya, where subtype
A, C and D circulate27,64. The AC recombinant was
also reported from India, where subtype C and A co-
circulate, though C is predominant65. The other URFs
reported are the B’01, a recombination of subtype B
and CRF01_AE from Thailand, USA and Myanmar
and recombinant B’C from Myanmar.
HIV-2: Unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 does not show any
difference in geographical distribution as all subtypes/
groups are found in West Africa. The two most
prevalent HIV-2 subtypes are A and B. Majority
of the HIV-2 characterized till date appears to be
group A reported from West African countries66-68.
Group B viruses seem to be more geographically
limited (Fig. 1). It has been reported from Abidjan,
Ivory Coast, France and Portugal5,7,69,70. Groups C,
D, E and F are designated based on the analysis of
partial sequences of viral genomes. Groups C and
D were identified from Liberia and groups E and F

represented by the phylogenetic analysis of full-
strength genomic sequences of a strain collected
from an asymptomatic blood donor from Ivory
Coast34.
The latest group, H was identified from a male
patient originating from Ivory Coast35.
Indian scenario
India has about 4.6 million people living with
HIV next only to South Africa. The national HIV
prevalence is between 0.4 and 1.3 per cent71.
HIV-1: The data from three centres in India show a
high prevalence of subtype C. In north India 78.4 per
cent of the strains were subtype C. The strain analysis
also found 68 per cent of the circulating subtype to
be C372. Another HIV-1 subtype study carried out in
western India demonstrated 96 per cent of the tested
samples to be subtype C with majority (66%) of them
being C373. A study undertaken among female sex
workers in Kolkata showed 95 per cent of strains to
be subtype C74. Among these subtype C strains, 68
per cent showed maximum homology to the C3-Indian
reference strain (NIH, HMA panel). A study from
south India also showed very similar findings to that
observed in the north, west and eastern parts of
India75. Ninety five percent of the 83 strains analyzed
showed homology with subtype C. Among the subtype
C strains that were further characterized, 90.38 per
cent had maximum homology with subtype C3.
Subtype A was detected in 3.7 per cent of the
individuals tested (Fig. 2)75. The other subtypes
reported in small proportion are subtypes A, B and a
report of unique recombinant variant AC65,75,76.

As the disease progresses to AIDS, compared to
the HIV-1 subtype B, lower frequency of shift from
non-syncytium inducing strains (NSI) to syncytium
inducing strains (SI) is observed in subtype C infected
individuals38. One of the reasons for this lack of shift
to SI from NSI may be the increased level of
expression of CCR5 in CD4+ T cells or the presence
of increased number of CD4 T cells expressing
CCR5.  Compared to the West, a higher proportion
of CD4+ T cells express CCR5 among the Indian
healthy controls and HIV infected individuals42. This
possibly gives the R5 HIV strain a replication
advantage over X4 HIV strains.
HIV-2: Grez et al77 documented a decade earlier that
the HIV-2 strains circulating in India were subtype
A strains. This was based on characterizing five strains
on sequencing, V1-V4 region of the envelope. The
percentage divergence of sequences in HIV-2 strains
from south India is minimal when compared with the
sequence from west India. It indicates that during
the period of 10 yr, HIV-2 strains circulating in India
have not undergone any significant divergence in the
envelope V3 region. The HIV-2 subtype A
predominant in western African countries is the one
mainly found to be circulating in the Indian
subcontinent as well. Subtype A of HIV-2 is seen
Fig.2. Genomic diversity of HIV-1 in four different regions of India.

both in monotypic and dual infections with HIV-178.
In this study78, the mean pair-wise genetic distances
among the south Indian strains were 7.8 per cent
(range 4.3-13.1%). This was similar to the distance
among the five strains isolated from western India in
1991 (mean 7.7%, range 5.6-10.5%). The mean
distances of the south Indian strains from the western
Indian subtype A strains were only 8.8 per cent (range
4.5-15.5%) for the V3 region. However, this was
12.9% (mean 5.9-19.4%) with reference to non-
Indian subtype A strains. The polygenetic tree
analysis also showed subtype A and non A strains
clustered as two separate groups. Among the subtype
A strains all the Indian strains were clustered together
in the tree.
Bhanja et al79 reported a HIV-2 strain, which
exhibited a mean genetic variation of 13.5 per cent
from the other four reference strains of HIV-2 from
India. Phylogenetic analysis of this strain has revealed
a close relatedness to the HIV-2 Rod sequence
isolated in offshore Senegal.
Summary
Currently based on the phylogenetic analysis of
the nucleotide sequences from the env gene, strains
belonging to group M of HIV-1 infection have been
classified into nine different genetic subtypes A-K,
with E and I being classified as recombinants. The
epidemiological trends suggest that env based subtype
C strains would dominate the HIV pandemic in coming
years. The geographic spread of subtype C strains is
also very diverse. It is prevalent in different regions
in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Genotype C3 is
the predominant HIV-1 subtype circulating in the
Indian subcontinent. Data from different parts of India
show a high prevalence of subtype C. In north India,
78.4 per cent of HIV-1 strain were subtype C and 68
per cent of the strain circulating were C3. From
western India, 96 per cent of samples subtyped were
subtype C with 66 per cent of them being C3. Among
female sex workers in Kolkata 95 per cent of the
HIV-1 strains were subtype C and 68 per cent were
C3. The south Indian subtype data are very similar to
that from the rest of India.
The HIV-2 genotypes recognized are A-H. Unlike
HIV-1, HIV-2 strains are predominantly found in
Africa. The Indian HIV-2 strains are identified as
subtype A. This is also the predominant strain
circulating in western African countries.
The issues confronting HIV vaccine development
are the still uncertain availability of measures of
protective immunity in volunteers, genetic variation
among the HIV strains along with diversity in
geographical distribution. Much progress has been
made addressing some of these issues offering
avenues of therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine
development and testing80-81.
