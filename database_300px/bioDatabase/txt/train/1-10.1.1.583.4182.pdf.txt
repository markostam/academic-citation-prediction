Abstract
This paper explores the relationship between international trade
and economic growth, employing cutting-edge panel cointegration
testing and estimation techniques. Annual panel data on 81 coun-
tries’ macroeconomic variables over the period 1960-2003 are ex-
ploited in empirical analysis. Various panel unit root tests demon-
strate that the data variables are integrated processes with unit
roots. Three distinct panel cointegration techniques are used to
estimate the regression equation. A positive bi-directional interac-
tive relationship between exports and output growth is found and
the positive impact of output on exports is a bit stronger than the
reverse. The positive association between investment share and
exports and the negative correlation between labor and exports
are confirmed. The exports of high income, high export, and high
investment countries seem to have somewhat larger output en-
hancement effects than those of low income, low export, and low
investment nations. Several elucidations and policy implications
are provided for the above findings.

134 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
1 Introduction
The development literature is full of researches investigating the
relationship between exports and growth. Most of such studies are
based on the neoclassical export-led growth hypothesis, arguing that
increased exports generate output growth as surveyed by Giles and
Williamson (2000). However, some researchers have contended that it is
output growth that causes higher exports as in Reppas and Christopou-
los (2005) among others. The controversy hasn’t been settled and has
important policy implications that the export-led growth hypothesis
suggests outward-oriented trade policy or export-promotion industrial-
ization strategy for developing countries, while the reverse causation
substantially weakens the persuasiveness of that policy.
This paper is motivated by the following facts. First, despite much
research we do not yet fully know the direction of causality between
trade and growth, i.e. whether trade causes growth or vice versa or
bidirectional causality could exist. Second, the effects of various country
characteristics on the trade-growth nexus have not been fully investi-
gated so far in the literature. Third, the results of research on the above
two facts can furnish vital policy implications for growth strategies and
trade policies of diverse developing countries, which currently make up
more than 80% of the world population based on the recent World Bank
and OECD data.
The objective of this paper is to provide conclusive evidence on the
validity of the export-led growth hypothesis and its alternatives, and
to extract trade and growth policy implications for developing coun-
tries. This paper explores the relationship between exports and output
growth, using cutting-edge panel cointegration testing and estimation
techniques. The empirical analysis of this study exploits annual panel
data on 81 countries’ macroeconomic variables. The annual panel data
are extracted from theWorld Development Indicators 2005 of the World
Bank and the sample period runs from 1960 to 2003. Various panel unit
root tests are conducted to demonstrate that the data variables are in-
tegrated processes with unit roots. A cointegration relationship, i.e. a
long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables in the regression
equation is found by heterogeneous panel cointegration tests. Three dis-

tinct panel cointegration estimation techniques such as adjusted OLS,
dynamic OLS, and fully-modified OLS are employed to estimate the
regression equation.
The contributions of this paper which explores the causal link be-
tween trade and growth are as follows. First, this study finds a strong
positive two-way interactive mechanism between exports and output
growth in contrast to most existing researches, which claim a one-way
relationship between exports and growth. Second, this study greatly im-
proves the credibility in regression analyses by using an expanded panel
of 81 developing and developed countries and various cutting-edge panel
cointegration testing and estimation techniques. To date, only samples
of a few dozen countries and one estimation technique have generally
been used in empirical analyses. Third, this paper elucidates on differ-
ences in the association between trade and growth according to country
characteristics, by analyzing the export-growth nexus in various country
groups classified by income level, trade policy, and investment ratio.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 classifies and sum-
marizes the existing researches on the connection between trade and
growth. In section 3, the hypotheses and regression models for empiri-
cal analysis are specified and panel unit root and cointegration testing
and estimation techniques for econometric analyses are explained. Sec-
tion 4 provides data descriptions for analysis and empirical results. In
section 5, the findings are recapitulated and the contributions of this
paper are presented.
2 Literature Review
The papers analyzing the connection between trade and economic
growth can be classified into several categories such as researches on
the exports-growth nexus (An and Iyigun (2004), Diao et al. (2006),
Love and Chandra (2005), Reppas and Christopoulos (2005), and Yu
(1998)), a meta-analysis (Mookerjee (2006)), openness measures (Har-
rison (1996) and Yanikkaya (2003)), R&D spillovers (Bayoumi et al.
(1999), Coe and Helpman (1995), Connolly (2003), and Schneider
(2005)), total factor productivity (Gopinath et al. (1995), Miller and
136 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
Upadhyay (2000)), trade and growth (Berg (1997) and Chand (1998)),
trade liberalization (Baldwin and Forslid (1999), Ben-David (2001),
Greenaway et al. (2002), Kim (2000)), etc. There are some papers
investigating the mixed effects of above factors. We briefly summarize
the papers exploring the trade-growth nexus as follows.
The literature examining the nexus between exports and growth
could be divided into 3 types such as papers that support unidirectional
causality from exports to growth, those with reverse causality, and some
with bidirectional causality. First, there are researches that support
the traditional export-led growth hypothesis. For instance, Frankel and
Romer (1999) construct measures of the geographic component of coun-
tries’ trade, and uses those measures to obtain instrumental variables
(IV) estimates of the effect of trade on income. Their results provide
no evidence that OLS estimates overstate the effects of trade. Fur-
ther, they suggest that trade has a quantitatively large and robust,
though only moderately statistically significant, positive effect on in-
come. Onafowora and Owoye (1998) investigate changes in economic
growth that are likely to result from changes in trade policies, exports,
and investment in 12 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Using a
vector error correction model (VECM), their results indicate that trade
policies, exports, and investment rate shocks have a significant impact
on economic growth in 10 of the 12 SSA countries. This suggests that
it is possible to stimulate economic growth in some African countries
through an outward-looking strategy of export expansion. Yu (1998)
demonstrates that fixed-capital investment and merchandise exports are
two most important determinants of China’s economic growth in the
1980-90s. Changes in fixed-capital investment uni-directionally caused
growth in industrial output and its sub-categories. Similar one-way
causal relations existed between exports and industrial output and its
sub-categories. However, no such causal relation was found between
imports and output. These findings suggest that China has followed an
investment-driven expansion path; China’s export-oriented trade strat-
egy has enhanced economic growth; and the import-permitting regime
has no contribution to economic performance.
Second, the papers presenting evidence for reverse causality from in-
come to exports are as follows. Love and Chandra (2005) seek to bridge
an important gap in the trade-growth literature and use Johansen’s mul-
Sangjoon Jun / Journal of Economic Research 12 (2007) 133–171 137
tivariate cointegration framework taking the terms of trade as an addi-
tional variable for Bangladesh. Their findings suggest that the direction
of both long and short-term causality is from income to exports. Their
result is hardly surprising as, for most of the period covered, Bangladesh
has followed an inward-looking strategy of development that discrimi-
nated against exports. Reppas and Christopoulos (2005) examine the
relationship between exports and output growth for a sample of 22 less
developed Asian and African countries over the period 1969-1999. Their
study goes beyond previous studies by using modern time series tech-
niques organized around panel unit roots and panel cointegration tests
to draw sharper conclusions from the short time series that are typi-
cally available in economics. They estimate the structural relationship
between output growth and exports by fully modified OLS (FMOLS)
techniques appropriate for heterogeneous panels. Their empirical find-
ings suggest that output growth causes exports and not the reverse.
Third, there are some studies that report bi-directional causality
between exports and growth. For example, Bahmani-Oskooee et al.
(1991) examine the causal relationship between export growth and eco-
nomic growth for 20 countries using Akaike’s optimal lag criterion in a
Granger causality test. Their results suggest some support for the ex-
port promotion hypothesis, especially in the case of well-known NICs.
They also conclude that a bi-directional causality between export and
output growth is a valid hypothesis. Konya (2006) investigates the pos-
sibility of Granger causality between exports and GDP in 24 OECD
countries from 1960 to 1997. Using SUR systems and Wald tests, he
finds one-way causality from exports to GDP, reverse causality, two-way
causality, and even no causality between exports and growth, depending
on the specific countries.
Fourth, other researches study the relationship between trade and
growth through meta-analysis and different techniques. Mookerjee
(2006) performs meta-analysis on a sample of seventy-six studies that
have empirically gauged the nexus between exports and economic
growth. The results show that studies that use aggregate exports report
lower t-ratios, but studies that use oil and manufactured exports report
higher t-ratios. This means that aggregate exports reduces the strength
of the relationship between exports and economic growth across the sam-
ple of studies, yet manufactured exports and oil exports strengthen the
138 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
relationship. Berg (1997) employs a simultaneous equation time-series
regression model to confirm the hypothesis that trade and growth are
directly related, using the 1960-1991 Mexican data. A direct test of the
relationship between trade and total factor productivity is also carried
out, confirming a positive relationship between them. Diao, Rattsø, and
Stokke (2006) argue that Thailand’s growth has been based on learning
by exporting and labor-intensive manufacturing with expanding domes-
tic backward linkages. Their analysis using a Ramsey model shows how
prolonged growth in Thailand can be explained by this learning mech-
anism and structural shift from agriculture to exportables.
3 Model and Economic Framework
3.1 Hypothesis and Model Specification
Some theoretical foundations are needed on the relationship between
exports and output growth in econometric model specification. First,
the advocates of the export-led growth hypothesis claim as follows. A
rise in demand for exports fosters specialization, learning by doing, im-
provements in entrepreneurial, management techniques, skill and tech-
nology, and the economies of scale in the export industry and the real-
location of resources from the inefficient non-trade sector to the efficient
export sector, thereby enhancing productivity and output growth, as ar-
gued by Ben-David & Loewy (1998), Giles & Williamson (2000), Kugler
(1991), Lal and Rajapatirana (1987), Yaghmaian (1994), and others.
In contrast, the supporters of inward-oriented trade policy or the
opponents of the export-led growth hypothesis argue that export-led
growth strategy cannot succeed because of the worsening of interna-
tional terms of trade (Prebisch (1962) and Emmanuel (1972)) and in-
sufficient and unstable demand for developing countries’ exports in the
world market (Adelman (1984), Jaffe (1985)). Other dissenters of the
export-led growth hypothesis insist that there are other factors to ex-
plain the economic growth of developing countries more appropriate
than exports. They assert that exports can be supported only by a
sound domestic production basis, which is established by the growth in
primary inputs and the productivity enhancement of those inputs as in
Sangjoon Jun / Journal of Economic Research 12 (2007) 133–171 139
Krugman (1984), Lancaster (1980), among others.
Last, the bi-directional or feedback relationship between exports and
output growth could exist. That is, increased exports boost output
through specialization, scale economies, and productivity improvement,
and in turn output growth leads to expanded exports by promoting fur-
ther specialization, scale economies, cost reduction, technical progress,
and comparative advantage, creating an interactive mechanism, as ar-
gued by Bahmani-Oskooee et al. (1991), Bhagwati (1988), Helpman
and Krugman (1985), Konya (2006), and others.
This paper attempts to investigate the validity of the following four
hypotheses based on the theoretical arguments presented above.
Hypothesis 1 Exports have significant positive effects on output growth.
This is called the export-led growth hypothesis.
This has been argued by most advocates of export-promotion in-
dustrialization strategy or outward oriented trade policy. In order to
test this hypothesis, we have to estimate a regression equation with real
output as the dependent variable, and real exports and other control
variables (e.g. the investment share, and the labor force, etc.) as ex-
planatory variables. We need to carry out panel unit root tests for the
existence of integrated processes and panel cointegration tests for long-
run equilibrium relations between the integrated processes, prior to any
possible panel cointegration estimation.
Hypothesis 2 Output growth may have significant positive effects on
export expansion. This could be called the growth-led export hypothesis.
That is, there could be a reverse causation running from income
(output) to exports. To test this hypothesis, it is needed to estimate
a regression equation with real exports as the dependent variable, and
real output and other control variables as regressors.
Hypothesis 3 There is a bi-directional or feedback relationship between
exports and growth.
This is a third possibility and testing this hypothesis will involve
140 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
comparing the estimation results of the above two regression equations
with either output or exports as the dependent variable.
Hypothesis 4 The export-output nexus may have different levels of sig-
nificance or strengths varying across country groups.
Testing this hypothesis will require a comparative analysis of the re-
gression results of distinct country groups classified by various criteria.
Considering the above hypotheses, the generalized form of the re-
gression equation for empirical analysis can be specified as follows:
Y = f(EX,Controls1, ²1) (1)
EX = f(Y,Controls2, ²2) (2)
where Y = real output, EX = real exports, Controls = control variables
= other variables that influence real output or real exports, and ² = an
error term. The above two regression equations take into account the
possibilities of uni- and bi-directional causation between exports and
output growth as stated in the hypotheses 1-3.
Based on the theories elaborated above, this paper employs the fol-
lowing regression equations as applied to heterogeneous panel data.
RGDPit = β0i + β1RXit + β2ISit + β3Lit + ²it (3)
RXit = γ0i + γ1RGDPit + γ2ISit + γ3Lit + vit (4)
where country i = 1, · · · , N , time t = 1, · · · , T , RGDP = real GDP,
RX = real exports, IS = the share of investment in GDP, L = the
labor force, β’s and γ’s = intercepts and coefficients, and ² and v =
disturbance terms.
Equation (3) to test the export-led growth hypothesis may be inter-
preted as an extended neoclassical production function, where output
is produced with capital and labor inputs and exports are included as
an additional input. In that case, the share of investment in GDP (IS)
could represent a proxy variable for the physical capital stock. Many
authors in the growth literature have used the investment share as a
proxy for capital due to the lack of internationally comparable data on
the capital stock. The most recent international panel databases such as
Sangjoon Jun / Journal of Economic Research 12 (2007) 133–171 141
Penn World Table 6.2 (2006) and World Development Indicators 2006
of the World Bank do not yet provide international panel data on the
capital stock. The availability of data also dictated us to use the labor
force instead of the number of persons employed for labor input. In the
production function interpretation of equation (3), both IS and L as
capital and labor inputs are expected to have positive correlations with
RGDP as real output.
For equation (4), Gylfason (1999) found a positive relationship be-
tween the investment share and exports, and a negative correlation be-
tween labor (L) and exports. The former suggests that rises in the in-
vestment share promote exports. The latter may be due to the tendency
that in large countries with high labor internal (domestic) exchange re-
places external (international) trade, when the labor variable is viewed
as an indicator of a country size.
The above regression equations may be represented as the following
standard heterogeneous panel regression equation:
yit = αi + β1x1it + · · ·+ βKxKit + ²it = αi + x′itβ + ²it,
i = 1, · · · , N ; t = 1, · · · , T (5)
where is the dependent variable, RGDPit or RXit, αi is the individual-
specific fixed effects term, β is the (K×1) coefficient vector on explana-
tory variables, xit is a K-dimensional vector of (the it-th observations
on) the explanatory variables comprising RX or RGDP, IS, and L, etc.,
and ²it is an error term. Other variables are defined as above. In this
paper we estimate the panel cointegration model of the regression equa-
tion by three distinct techniques such as AOLS (adjusted OLS), DOLS
(dynamic OLS) and FMOLS (fully-modified OLS), a la Kao and Chiang
(2000) and Pedroni (2000, 2004).
3.2 Panel Cointegration Tests and Estimation
The cointegration methodology as applied to time series data was
first introduced in the 1980s as in Engle and Granger (1987), Johansen
(1988, 1991, 1992), Johansen and Juselius (1990, 1992), and others. In
the early 1990s, cointegration techniques have been extended to apply
to panel data. There has been much research on panel cointegration
142 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
since the mid 1990s. Excellent surveys on nonstationary panels, panel
cointegration, and dynamic panels are made in Baltagi (2005: Ch. 12),
Baltagi and Kao (2000), and Banerjee (1999), among others.
A panel unit root and cointegration approach has many benefits
compared to a conventional time series approach. First, by pooling
time series and cross sections, finite sample power of test is significantly
improved. The conventional unit root tests such as augmented Dickey-
Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests are widely reported to have
low power performance when the time-series sample size is small. Levin
and Lin (1992, 2002) and Im, Pesaran, and Shin (1997, 2003) among
others demonstrate that the power of unit root tests using panel data
is substantially improved over univariate testing procedures. Mark and
Sul (2001), Oh (1996), and Pedroni (1997, 1999, 2004) also report power
improvement of the panel cointegration approach. Second, pooling time
series and cross sections (using panel data) may provide more useful in-
formation on the nature of the economic system of equations for a group
of countries or institutions, than individually analyzing a single equation
for each country or institution.
Panel unit root tests can be categorized into tests assuming a com-
mon unit root process across cross sections and those positing individ-
ual unit root processes. Levin, Lin, and Chu (LLC: Levin & Lin (1992,
1993), Levin et al. (2002)), Breitung (2000), Hadri (2000), and Harris
and Tzavalis (1999) all postulate that there is a common unit root pro-
cess across cross sections. Im, Pesaran, and Shin (IPS: Im et al. (1997,
2003)), Choi (2001), Maddala and Wu (MW: Maddala & Wu (1999))
propose panel unit root tests that allow for individual unit root pro-
cesses, so that the persistence parameter (autocorrelation coefficient)
may vary across cross sections. Among these, only Hadri (2000)’s panel
unit root test has the null hypothesis of no unit root, similar to the
single series unit root test of Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin
(KPSS: Kwiatkowski et al. (1992)). All other panel unit root tests
have the null of unit roots. All the researchers above corroborate the
fact that panel unit root tests have a greater power than conventional
single-series unit root tests by Monte Carlo simulations. Due to space
limitations, detailed introduction to individual panel unit root tests has
been omitted. Please refer to the papers mentioned above for details.
Kao (1999), McCoskey and Kao (1998), and Pedroni (1999, 2004)
Sangjoon Jun / Journal of Economic Research 12 (2007) 133–171 143
have proposed panel cointegration tests. Kao (1999) presents residual-
based tests for cointegration regression in panel data. He constructs
Dickey-Fuller (DF) and augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests for the
null of no cointegration. McCoskey and Kao (1998) propose a residual-
based Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for the null of cointegration in
panel data. They find that the empirical sizes of the LM-FM and LM-
DOLS are close to the true size even in small samples. Pedroni (1999,
2004) examines the properties of residual-based tests for the null of no
cointegration for dynamic panels in which both the short-run dynamics
and the long-run slope coefficients are permitted to be heterogeneous
across individual members of the panel. He derives seven test statistics
for the null of no cointegration in heterogeneous panels with multiple
regressors.
Kao and Chiang (2000) study the asymptotic distributions for ordi-
nary least squares (OLS), fully-modified OLS (FMOLS), and dynamic
OLS (DOLS) estimators in cointegrated regression models of panel data.
Their Monte Carlo simulation results show that the OLS estimator
has a non-negligible bias in finite samples, the FMOLS estimator does
not improve over the OLS estimator in general, and the DOLS out-
performs both the OLS and FMOLS estimators. Pedroni(2000, 2004)
also presents independently estimation methods of the panel cointegra-
tion model using FMOLS. In this paper, we estimate panel cointegra-
tion models by three different methods including AOLS (adjusted OLS
= biased corrected OLS), DOLS (dynamic OLS), and FMOLS(fully-
modified OLS), a la Kao and Chiang (2000) and Pedroni (2000, 2004).
This paper allows heterogeneity in individual specific fixed effects
across countries by use of nonstationary, dynamic panel estimation
techniques. This paper contributes to the literature on the relation-
ship between exports and output growth by using recently developed
panel cointegration techniques, thereby improving the power perfor-
mance of the relevant estimation and inference procedures. So far the
panel cointegration methodology has been mainly applied to exploring
exchange rate determination (Rapach and Wohar (2004)), purchasing
power parity (PPP) hypotheses (Pedroni, 2004), growth determinants
(Christopoulos and Tsionas (2004)), international R&D spillovers (Ed-
mond (2001)), money demand and IT investment (Jun (2004, 2006)),
savings-investment correlation (Ho (2002)), etc. If the presence of unit
144 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
roots in the various panel data series is proved by panel unit root tests,
the studies that do not consider panel unit roots can suffer from reduced
confidence on their estimation and inference results, due to the spurious
regression problem of Granger and Newbold(1974) and Entorf (1997).
In the presence of panel unit roots, it is required to estimate the regres-
sion equation by panel cointegration techniques such as AOLS (adjusted
OLS), DOLS (dynamic OLS), and FMOLS (fully-modified OLS), based
on appropriate panel cointegration tests.
4 Empirical Analysis
4.1 Data
Empirical analysis of this paper uses annual panel data (1960-2003)
on 81 countries’ macroeconomic variables. In particular, real GDP
(RGDP) or real exports (RX) of goods and services are exploited as
the dependent variable, and RX or RGDP, the investment share (IS)
and the labor force (L) as explanatory variables in the regression equa-
tion. The data on 81 countries’ RGDP, RX, IS, and L are extracted
from the World Development Indicators (WDI) 2005 CD-ROM of the
World Bank.
Table 1 presents the definitions, descriptive statistics, and data
source of the dependent and explanatory variables used in empirical
analyses for three samples involving the entire sample (81 countries),
the OECD sample (26 countries), and the non-OECD sample (55 coun-
tries). Four countries such as Czech Republic, Poland, Slovak Republic,
and Turkey are excluded from the OECD sample in order to make a
balanced panel, since they have data only from the 1980s. RGDP is
defined as GDP in constant 2000 US dollars, RX as exports in constant
2000 US dollars, IS as gross capital formation in percent of GDP, and
L as the total labor force.
The reason that medians are shown in Table 1 in addition to arith-
metic means is that we employ medians instead of means as the group
classification criterion in the following country group analyses. The me-
dian instead of the mean is utilized, since the numbers of countries in
the groups become unbalanced when the mean is employed. For ex-

ports) are US dollars, the unit of investment shares is percent (%), and
that of L(labor force) is a number of thousand persons. Four countries
such as Czech Republic, Poland, Slovak Republic, and Turkey are ex-
cluded from the OECD sample in order to make a balanced panel, since
they have data only from the 1980s. In the regression equation, RGDP
or RX is used as the dependent variable and RX or RGDP, IS and L as
explanatory variables.

ample, in the country group classification by income level there are 40
high income (per capita real GDP > sample median) and 41 low income
countries (per capita real GDP < median) by the median, while there
are 25 high income and 56 low income countries by the mean so that
the groups become excessively unbalanced.
The country group classification by trade strategy (export ratio) di-
vides countries into 36 high export (export/GDP > sample median)
and 45 low export countries (export/GDP < median). By the mean,
there are 28 high export and 53 low export countries. The classifica-
tion by investment ratio dichotomizes countries into 42 high investment
(investment/GDP > sample median) and 39 low investment countries
(investment/GDP < median). By the mean, there are 43 high invest-
ment and 38 low investment countries. The empirical results using the
mean classification are similar to those from the median classification,
although they are not reported due to space limitations. We categorize
countries by different standards such as income level, export policy and
investment share, since we’d like to see the effects of trade on growth
in various country characteristics. Moreover, high income OECD coun-
tries do not necessarily correspond to high export and high investment
countries and the classified subsamples are actually quite different.
4.2 Empirical Results
This section reports the results of time series and panel unit root
tests on the data variables, panel cointegration tests, and panel coin-
tegration estimation. First, Table 2 exhibits the results of traditional
time-series unit root tests including the ADF (augmented Dickey-Fuller)
and PP (Phillips-Perron) tests for the OECD sample (30 countries). For
RGDP, we can reject the null hypothesis of unit roots only for Finland,
Portugal, and Sweden by the ADF test, and for Czech Republic by the
PP test at or below the 5% significance level. For RX, the null hypoth-
esis can be rejected only for Italy by the ADF test, and for Poland by
the PP test. For IS, the null is rejected only for Finland, Germany,
Luxembourg, Portugal, Sweden, and U.K. by the ADF test, and for
Luxembourg by the PP test. For L, the null is rejected only for U.S.
by the ADF test, and for Mexico, Poland by the PP test at or below

An individual trend and an intercept are included in the panel unit root test equation
for the log level variables. We employ the modified Schwarz method for automatic
selection of lag length, the Parzen kernel as the kernel function of spectral estimation,
and the Andrews method for automatic bandwidth selection. Similar results were ob-
tained when only an individual intercept was included in the test equation, when the
Akaike, Schwarz, Hannan-Quinn, modified Akaike, modified Hannan-Quinn methods
were exploited for lag length selection, and when the Bartlett and quadratic spec-
tral kernels were applied for spectral estimation, and when the Newey-West method
was utilized for automatic bandwidth selection. See Table 1 for definitions of the
variables, RGDP, RX, IS, and L.
5%. Overall, we cannot reject the null of unit roots in all four variables,
RGDP, RX, IS, and L for the majority of cases in the 30 country OECD
sample, using conventional ADF and PP tests.
Table 3 displays the results of five distinct panel unit root tests, such
as Levin, Lin, and Chu (2002: LLC)’s t*, Breitung (2000)’s t, Hadri
(2000)’s Z, Im, Pesaran, and Shin (2003: IPS)’s W, and Maddala and
Wu (1999)’s PP-Fisher χ2 statistics for three samples. Among these,
LLC, Breitung, and Hadri’s tests are based on the common unit root
process assumption that the autocorrelation coefficients of the tested
variables across cross sections are identical. However, IPS and PP-
Sangjoon Jun / Journal of Economic Research 12 (2007) 133–171 149
Fisher χ2 tests rely on the individual unit root process assumption that
the autocorrelation coefficients vary across cross sections. All the other
4 panel unit root tests except for Hadri (2000)’s have the null hypoth-
esis of unit roots, while Hadri’s test posits the null of no unit roots
(stationarity).
In Table 3, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of panel unit roots in
RGDP and RX by all 5 tests for all samples at conventional significance
levels, except for RGDP by Breitung’s test in the OECD sample. Yet
for IS, the unit root hypothesis can be rejected by 3 out of 5 tests in the
entire and OECD samples, while the hypothesis is rejected only by 2 out
of 5 tests in the non-OECD sample. For L, the unit root hypothesis can
be rejected only by 2 out of 5 tests in the entire and non-OECD samples,
while the hypothesis is not rejected by any of the 5 tests in the OECD
sample. Hence the panel unit root tests give us mixed conclusions on the
existence of unit roots in IS and L, while those tests definitely support
the existence of unit roots in RGDP and RX. In sum, 3 out of 5 or
all tests show unit roots in L, while 2 or 3 out of 5 tests confirm unit
roots in IS for the three samples. Since only for IS more tests seem to
reject the unit root hypothesis in the entire and OECD samples, which
is mainly due to the OECD sample, we should go back to the results
in Table 2 to decide whether there are unit roots in IS. The results of
traditional time-series unit root tests in Table 2 indicate that there are
unit roots in RGDP, RX, IS, and L in most cases of the OECD sample.
Thus we can conclude that there exist unit roots in IS and L for most
cases, and in RGDP and RX for almost all cases of tests and samples.
Since we found the existence of unit roots in all the variables by vari-
ous panel unit root tests, panel cointegration tests should be conducted
to examine whether there is a long-term equilibrium relationship be-
tween the dependent variable (RGDP or RX) and explanatory variables
(RX or RGDP, IS and L) in the regression equation. Table 4 reports
the results of panel cointegration tests. We perform the heterogeneous
panel cointegration tests of Pedroni (1999), which allow for heteroge-
neous cointegration vectors and dynamic errors. Pedroni (1999)’s het-
erogeneous panel cointegration test statistics are all standardized and
follow the standard normal distribution asymptotically. The null hy-
pothesis of all the tests is no cointegration. In all 42 cases of 7 panel
cointegration test statistics, 2 dependent variables, and 3 samples, the

null of no cointegration among the variables is strongly rejected at the
1% significance level. Hence the variables in the regression equation,
which individually contain unit roots, seem to have a cointegration re-
lation, i.e. a long-run equilibrium relationship.
Tables 5-7 present the results of panel cointegration estimation of the
regression equation using the entire, OECD, and non-OECD samples.
In Tables 5-7, we compare the estimation results using RGDP or RX
as the dependent variable, and RX or RGDP, IS, and L as explanatory
variables. Three different estimation methods such as AOLS (adjusted
OLS = bias-corrected OLS), DOLS (dynamic OLS), and FMOLS (fully-
modified OLS) are employed to guarantee the robustness of empirical
results.

is significantly positive in all three estimation methods. Yet the coeffi-
cient estimates on RGDP are higher than those on RX, suggesting that
the positive effects of RGDP on RX are greater than those of RX on
RGDP. For example, the coefficient estimates on RGDP by DOLS and
FMOLS are about 1.1 while those on RX are around 0.8. This implies
that there is a positive two-way causal relationship between output and
exports, not one-way and that the positive impact of RGDP on RX is a
little stronger than the reverse. That is, exports induce output growth
and in turn output growth enhances exports and the latter relationship
is somewhat stronger than the former. Among other control variables,
the investment share (IS) is estimated to be positive and significant in
2 out of 3 cases for either RGDP or RX as the dependent variable,
as predicted by theory. The labor force (L) is significantly positive in
all three estimates with RGDP as the dependent variable, while L is
significantly negative in all three estimates with RX as the dependent
variable. The R2 and adjusted R2 values are in the range 0.40-0.87 in
the output-exports equation, while those values are from 0.31 to 0.81
in the exports-output regression. The R2 values indicate relatively high
goodness of fit and explanatory power of the regression model and re-
gressors.

Table 6 displays the panel cointegration estimation results of the
regression equation employing the OECD sample of 26 countries with
RGDP or RX as the dependent variable, and RX or RGDP, IS and L as
explanatory variables. When RGDP or RX is the dependent variable,
the RX or RGDP regressor is significantly positive in all three estimation
methods. Yet the coefficient estimates on RGDP are higher than those
on RX, suggesting that the positive effects of RGDP on RX are greater
than those of RX on RGDP. For example, the coefficient estimates on
RGDP range from 1.0 to 1.7, while those on RX are between 0.5 and
0.7. This implies that there is a positive two-way causal relationship
between output and exports, not one-way and that the positive impact
of RGDP on RX is a little stronger than the reverse. That is, exports
induce output growth and in turn output growth enhances exports and
the latter relationship is somewhat stronger than the former. Among
other control variables, the investment share (IS) is estimated to be sig-
nificantly positive in all 3 cases with RGDP as the dependent variable,
while IS is significantly negative in all cases with RX as the dependent
variable. The labor force (L) is significantly positive in all 3 estimates

and adjusted R2 values are in the range 0.58-0.93 in the output-exports
equation, while those values are from 0.34 to 0.93 in the exports-output
regression. The R2 values indicate relatively high goodness of fit and
explanatory power of the regression model and regressors.
Table 7 reports the results of panel cointegration estimation of the
regression equation utilizing the non-OECD sample of 55 countries with
RGDP or RX as the dependent variable, and RX or RGDP, IS and L as
explanatory variables. When RGDP or RX is the dependent variable,
the RX or RGDP regressor is significantly positive in all three estima-
tion methods. Yet the coefficient estimates on RGDP are higher than
those on RX, suggesting that the positive effects of RGDP on RX are
greater than those of RX on RGDP. For example, the coefficient esti-
mates on RGDP range from 1.1to 1.3, while those on RX are between
0.4 and 0.8.
This implies that there is a positive two-way causal relationship be-
tween output and exports, not one-way and that the positive impact
of RGDP on RX is a little stronger than the reverse. That is, exports
induce output growth and in turn output growth enhances exports and
the latter relationship is somewhat stronger than the former. Among

significantly positive in 2 out of 3 cases with either RGDP or RX as
the dependent variable. The labor force (L) is significantly positive in
all 3 estimates with RGDP as the dependent variable, while L is sig-
nificantly negative in 2 out of 3 estimates with RX as the dependent
variable. The R2 and adjusted R2 values are in the range 0.54-0.85 in
the output-exports equation, while those values are from 0.41 to 0.77
in the exports-output regression. The R2 values indicate relatively high
goodness of fit and explanatory power of the regression model and re-
gressors. The R2 values of AOLS and FMOLS are generally higher than
those of DOLS, when we exclude the out of range values.
Summing up the results of Tables 5-7, we find that the coefficient
estimates on RGDP are higher than those on RX, suggesting that the
positive effects of RGDP (real GDP) on RX (real exports) are greater
than those of RX on RGDP. This implies that there is a positive two-
way causal relationship between output and exports, not one-way and
that the positive impact of RGDP on RX is a little stronger than the re-
verse. That is, exports induce output growth and in turn output growth
enhances exports and the latter relationship is somewhat stronger than
the former. The R2 values indicate relatively high goodness of fit and
explanatory power of the regression model and regressors.
Tables 8-10 present the results of the country group analyses by
income level, trade strategy (export ratio), and investment ratio, em-
ploying the entire sample of 81 countries. Table 8 exhibits the results of
the country group analysis by income level, utilizing the entire sample.
High income countries are those with per capita real GDP greater than
the sample median, while low income countries have an income level less
than the median. There are 40 high income and 41 low income countries
by the median. The median instead of the mean is utilized, since the
numbers of countries in the groups become unbalanced when the mean
is employed.
The upper half panel of Table 8 displays the results of panel coin-
tegration estimation with RGDP as the dependent variable. For both
high and low income countries, the coefficient estimates on RX are sig-
nificantly positive in all 3 estimation methods. The coefficient estimates
on RX for high income countries are a bit larger than those for low in-
come countries in 2 out of 3 cases. This implies that RX of high income
countries has somewhat greater positive effects on RGDP than that of

sample median, and 39 low investment countries with investment/GDP < median.
The median instead of the mean is utilized, since the numbers of countries in the
groups become unbalanced when the mean is employed. * denotes significance at
10%, and ** represents significance at or below 5%
than the median. There are 42 high investment and 39 low investment
countries by the median. The upper half panel of Table 10 presents the
results of panel cointegration estimation with RGDP as the dependent
variable. For both high and low investment countries, the coefficient
estimates on RX are significantly positive in all 3 estimation methods.
The coefficient estimates on RX for high investment countries are a bit
larger than those for low investment countries in all 3 cases. This implies
that RX of high investment countries has somewhat greater positive ef-
fects on RGDP than that of low investment countries. Among the other
control variables, the investment share (IS) is estimated to be signifi-
cantly positive in 4 out of 6 cases. The labor force (L) is significantly
Sangjoon Jun / Journal of Economic Research 12 (2007) 133–171 159
positive in all 3 estimates for both high and low investment countries,
as predicted by theory. The R2 and adjusted R2 values range from 0.28
to 0.91, and the R2 values of high investment countries are generally
higher than those of low investment countries. This suggests that the
goodness of fit and explanatory power of the regression model are better
for high investment countries than low investment countries.
The lower half panel of Table 10 exhibits the results of panel coin-
tegration estimation with RX as the dependent variable. For both high
and low investment countries, the coefficient estimates on RGDP are
significantly positive in all 3 estimation methods. The coefficient es-
timates on RGDP for high investment countries are a bit larger than
those for low investment countries in 2 out of 3 cases. This implies
that RGDP of high investment countries has somewhat greater positive
effects on RX than that of low investment countries. Among the other
control variables, the investment share (IS) is estimated to be signifi-
cantly negative in 3 out of 6 cases. The labor force (L) is insignificant
and negative in 5 out of 6 cases. The R2 and adjusted R2 values range
from 0.29 to 0.87, and the R2 values of high investment countries are
generally higher than those of low investment countries. This suggests
that the goodness of fit and explanatory power of the regression model
are better for high investment countries than low investment countries.
The results of Tables 8-10 may be summarized as follows. Empiri-
cal analyses for diverse country groups classified by income level, trade
strategy (export ratio), and investment ratio have yielded the following
results. In the country group analysis by income level, the exports of
high income countries produce somewhat larger effects on output en-
hancement than those of low income countries. Moreover, the output
growth of high income countries seems to have a slightly greater impact
on export expansion. High income countries generally have compara-
tive advantage in capital- and technology-intensive industries and this
competitive edge may act as an engine of growth and exports, leading
to the superiority in output and exports enhancing effects or stronger
two-way causal link mechanism between exports and output.
In the country group analysis by trade strategy (export ratio), the
exports of high export countries with an export-promotion industrializa-
tion strategy display a bit larger positive effects on output than those of
low export countries with a domestic-market oriented strategy such as
160 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
import substituting industrialization. Furthermore, the output growth
of high export countries appears to have a little greater influence on
increasing exports. High export countries with an export-oriented in-
dustrialization strategy tend to invest more in export industries and
thereby enjoying comparative advantage and competitive edge in those
industries, which in turn act as an engine of exports and growth and
may lead to the superiority in output and exports enhancing effects or
stronger two-way causal link mechanism between exports and output.
This point can also be recognized by the fact that most of the high
performance Asian economies such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Sin-
gapore, Taiwan, etc. have adopted export-promotion industrialization
strategies and proved successful in output growth and export expansion.
In the country group analysis by investment ratio, the exports of
high investment countries show somewhat larger positive effects on out-
put than those of low investment countries. Moreover, the output
growth of high investment countries seems to have a slightly greater im-
pact on augmenting exports. High investment countries tend to invest
more in human capital and technology and thus enjoying competitive
edge in total factor productivity, which in turn acts as an engine of
growth and could lead to the superiority in output and exports enhanc-
ing effects or stronger two-way causal link mechanism between exports
and output. This argument may be corroborated by the fact that most
of the high performance Asian economies such as South Korea, Hong
Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan have invested heavily in human capital
and research and development (R&D) and generated remarkable success
in growth and export expansion.
In Tables 11-12, the results of sensitivity analyses using percentage
data and additional regressors capturing government size and human
capital are presented. This is to confirm the validity of the previous
estimation results using level data reported in Tables 5-10. In Ta-
bles 11-12, the dependent variable is the GDPV(GDP volume index:
2000=100) extracted from the IFS CD-ROM, and the regressors are
XPR(exports/GDP), IS(investment/GDP), GER(government expendi-
ture/GDP), and LIT(adult literacy rate) from the World Development
Indicators. We can see that the variables in the regression equation are
now in indices and percentages instead of levels. The output equation in
the left panels of Tables 11-12 implies that GDP may be influenced by

openness(exports ratio), investment share, government size, and human
capital(literacy rate). The exports equation in the right panels of Tables
11-12 suggests that exports could be affected by GDP, investment, gov-
ernment policy, and human capital. This specification is based on the
findings of some researchers such as Benhabib and Spiegel(2005) that
the level of education (human capital) speeds technology diffusion via
trade and leads to growth, as suggested by Nelson and Phelps(1966).
The results presented in Table 11 are mostly similar to those in Ta-
ble 5. That is, when GDPV or XPR is the dependent variable, the
XPR or GDPV regressor is significantly positive in all three estimation
methods. This again implies that there is a positive two-way causal re-
lationship between output and exports, not one-way. The estimates in
Table 12 show that the positive bi-directional relationship between GDP
and exports for low income countries seems more significant than that
for high income countries. Both output-enhancing effects of exports and

exports-promoting impact of output seem to be greater in low income
countries than high income countries. Generally speaking, the outcome
of sensitivity analyses in Tables 11-12 supports the main conclusions
of this paper. There is a positive two-way causal relationship between
exports and output growth and the positive association varies accord-
ing to the country characteristics such as income levels and investment
ratios.
5 Concluding Remarks
This paper investigates the relationship between international trade
and economic growth, using cutting-edge panel cointegration testing and
estimation techniques. The empirical analysis of this study exploits an-
nual panel data on 81 countries’ macroeconomic variables. The annual
panel data are extracted from the World Development Indicators (WDI)
2005 of the World Bank and the sample period runs from 1960 to 2003.
Various panel unit root tests are conducted to demonstrate that the
data variables are integrated processes with unit roots. A cointegration
relationship, i.e. a long-run equilibrium relationship among the vari-
ables in the regression equation is found by heterogeneous panel cointe-
gration tests. Three distinct panel cointegration estimation techniques
such as AOLS (adjusted OLS), DOLS (dynamic OLS), and FMOLS
(fully-modified OLS) are employed to estimate the regression equation.
The major findings of this paper are as follows. First, we find that
the positive effects of output growth on exports are greater than those of
exports on output. This implies that there is a positive two-way causal
relationship between exports and output, not one-way and that the pos-
itive impact of output on exports is a little stronger than the reverse.
That is, exports induce output growth and in turn output growth en-
hances exports and the latter relationship is somewhat stronger than the
former. Second, the positive relationship between the investment share
and exports and the negative association between labor and exports are
confirmed in most cases. The former finding suggests that increases
in the investment share promote exports, while the latter implies that
in large countries internal (domestic) exchange replaces external trade
164 Bi-directional Relationships between Exports and Growth
(exports), viewing labor as a proxy for country size.
Third, in the country group analysis by income level, the exports
of high income countries produce somewhat larger effects on output en-
hancement than those of low income countries. Moreover, the output
growth of high income countries seems to have a slightly greater impact
on export expansion. High income countries generally have compara-
tive advantage in capital- and technology-intensive industries and this
competitive edge may act as an engine of growth and exports, leading
to the superiority in output and exports enhancing effects or stronger
two-way causal link mechanism between exports and output.
Fourth, in the country group analysis by trade strategy (export ra-
tio), the exports of high export countries with an export-promotion
industrialization strategy display a bit larger positive effects on out-
put than those of low export countries with a domestic-market oriented
strategy such as import substituting industrialization. Furthermore,
the output growth of high export countries appears to have a little
greater influence on increasing exports. High export countries with an
export-oriented industrialization strategy tend to invest more in export
industries and thereby enjoying comparative advantage and competitive
edge in those industries, which in turn act as an engine of exports and
growth and may lead to the superiority in output and exports enhanc-
ing effects or stronger two-way causal link mechanism between exports
and output. This point can also be recognized by the fact that most
of the high performance Asian economies such as South Korea, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, etc. have adopted export-promotion industri-
alization strategies and proved successful in output growth and export
expansion.
Fifth, in the country group analysis by investment ratio, the exports
of high investment countries show somewhat larger positive effects on
output than those of low investment countries. Moreover, the output
growth of high investment countries seems to have a slightly greater im-
pact on augmenting exports. High investment countries tend to invest
more in human capital and technology and thus enjoying competitive
edge in total factor productivity, which in turn acts as an engine of
growth and could lead to the superiority in output and exports enhanc-
ing effects or stronger two-way causal link mechanism between exports
and output. This argument may be corroborated by the fact that most

of the high performance Asian economies such as South Korea, Hong
Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan have invested heavily in human capital
and research and development (R&D) and generated remarkable suc-
cess in growth and export expansion. The results of sensitivity analyses
using different data and addition regressors generally support the main
conclusions of this paper.
The contributions of this paper which explores the causal link be-
tween trade and growth are as follows. First, this study finds a strong
positive two-way interactive mechanism between exports and output
growth in contrast to most existing researches, which claim a one-way
relationship between exports and growth. The robustness of this finding
is corroborated by different panel estimation procedures and sub-sample
analyses. Second, this study greatly improves the credibility in regres-
sion analyses by using an expanded panel of 81 developing and developed
countries and various cutting-edge panel unit root, panel cointegration
testing and estimation techniques. To date, only samples of a few dozen
countries and one estimation technique have generally been used in em-
pirical analyses. Third, this paper elucidates on differences in the associ-
ation between trade and growth according to country characteristics, by
analyzing the export-growth nexus in various country groups classified
by income level, trade policy, and investment ratio.
