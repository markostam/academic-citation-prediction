ABSTRACT
The OrthoMCL database (http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.
edu) houses ortholog group predictions for 55 spe-
10cies, including 16 bacterial and 4 archaeal genomes
representing phylogenetically diverse lineages, and
most currently available complete eukaryotic gen-
omes: 24 unikonts (12 animals, 9 fungi, microsporid-
ium, Dictyostelium, Entamoeba), 4 plants/algae and
157 apicomplexan parasites. OrthoMCL software was
used to cluster proteins based on sequence sim-
ilarity, using an all-against-all BLAST search of each
species’ proteome, followed by normalization of
inter-species differences, and Markov clustering. A
20 total of 511 797 proteins (81.6% of the total dataset)
were clustered into 70 388 ortholog groups. The
ortholog database may be queried based on protein
or group accession numbers, keyword descrip-
tions or BLAST similarity. Ortholog groups exhibit-
25 ing specific phyletic patterns may also be identified,
using either a graphical interface or a text-based
Phyletic Pattern Expression grammar. Information
for ortholog groups includes the phyletic profile,
the list of member proteins and a multiple sequence
30alignment, a statistical summary and graphical view
of similarities, and a graphical representation of
domain architecture. OrthoMCL software, the entire
FASTA dataset employed and clustering results are
available for download. OrthoMCL-DB provides a
35centralized warehouse for orthology prediction
among multiple species, and will be updated and
expanded as additional genome sequence data
become available.
INTRODUCTION
40 The ongoing sequencing of multiple genomes creates a grow-
ing need for functional annotation. Comparative approaches
based on ortholog identification have been particularly useful,
enabling protein function to be inferred based on information
available from other species, and providing the raw material
45for evolutionary analysis (1). Homologous proteins share a
common ancestry, and may be characterized as orthologs
(which diverged from a common ancestral gene owing to
speciation) or paralogs (which derive from a gene duplication
event) (2). In general, orthologous genes are expected to retain
50similar (if not identical) function, while paralogs may more
readily acquire novel functional roles.
OrthoMCL is a graph-clustering algorithm designed to
identify homologous proteins based on sequence similarity,
and distinguish orthologous from paralogous relationships
55without computationally intensive phylogenetic analysis (3).
The algorithm first flags probable orthologous pairs identified
by BLAST analysis as reciprocal best hits across two genomes
(1), creating a graph in which edge weights connecting each
protein pair are based on BLAST similarity scores. In addition,
60probable in-paralogs arising from duplication events subse-
quent to species divergence (2) are identified as sequences
within the same genome that are (reciprocally) more similar
to each other than either is to any sequence from other
genomes, i.e. reciprocal better hits (3). Attaching these in-
65paralogous relationships, and incorporating edges connecting
the resulting co-orthologs, overcomes the inability of simple
reciprocal best hit approaches to detect many-to-many rela-
tionships (3,4). Edge weights are then adjusted to account for
genome-to-genome similarity averages, and the resulting
70graph is clustered using the MCL algorithm (5), reducing
large clusters containing weak single linkages into smaller
clusters that are more robust in their representation of truly
orthologous relationships (3). In contrast to TribeMCL (7),
which clusters proteins based on all BLAST similarities, pro-
75ducing large protein families, OrthoMCL focuses on the iden-
tification of proteins whose similarity suggests true orthology.
As a fully automated method, OrthoMCL is applicable to
multiple species datasets by bypassing the labor-intensive
manual curation involved in the construction of the NCBI
80KOG (euKaryotic Ortholog Groups) database (6). Preliminary
results indicate that OrthoMCL groups exhibit higher levels

of functional consistency than other ortholog identification
algorithms (data not shown).
OrthoMCL was designed to address the difficulties inherent
in identifying eukaryotic orthologs, focusing on the recogni-
5 tion of recent duplications, and the use of Markov clustering to
separate groups linked by protein fusions (7). An initial report
described clustering of six eukaryotic genomes and one ref-
erence prokaryotic species (Escherichia coli K12) (3). Many
additional genome sequences have been released in the last
10 2 years, however, stimulating considerable demand for the
identification of ortholog groups. This report describes clus-
tering of the predicted proteomes for 35 eukaryotic and 20
diverse prokaryotic species (both bacteria and archaea), span-
ning the tree of life (Figure 1), and an online database for
15 perusing, querying and retrieving of these clusters.
METHODS
Protein sequence data
Translated protein sequences for all eukaryotic genomes con-
sidered complete as on July 2005 were obtained from the
20 following sources: bacterial and archaeal sequences from
GenBank (8); many eukaryotic sequences (e.g. Drosophila
melanogaster and Homo sapiens) from Ensembl (9); other
sequences from the relevant sequencing centers or organism-
specific databases (see Table 1). In some cases, this resulted in
25the inclusion of proteins derived from differentially spliced
transcripts. Because various naming systems are used for
protein identification at the different source sites, a unified
sequence accession format (consisting of the genome abbre-
viation followed by a number) was used to provide each pro-
30tein with a unique identifier. Original sequence identifiers were
incorporated into the sequence description. A total of 627 098
protein sequences was obtained from 55 genomes (see
Table 1).
OrthoMCL clustering
35OrthoMCL was originally designed as a pipeline integrated
with a GUS (Genomic Unified Schema) relational database
(http://www.gusdb.org). In response to multiple requests from
users, a stand-alone Perl script version of OrthoMCL is now
available from the website, allowing this ortholog clustering
40algorithm to be run without a relational database. OrthoMCL
accepts as input a tab-delimited summary of all-against-
all sequence similarity search data, including estimates of
Figure 1. A phylogeny was constructed for 55 sequenced genomes based on orthologous gene content. See Table 1 for species abbreviations. The tree was drawn
using Phylodendron (http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/treeapp/treeprint-form.html).

statistical significance in the form of expectation values. For
this dataset, a single FASTA file was compiled from all
genomes, and a WU-BLASTP (10) search was performed
using the following parameters: E ¼ 1 · 105 word-
5mask ¼ seg + xnu W ¼ 3 T ¼ 1000. BLAST results were
fed into the stand-alone OrthoMCL program using a default
MCL inflation parameter of 1.5.
Construction of the OrthoMCL database
Results from the OrthoMCL clustering were loaded into a
10custom MySQL relational database, along with additional
computational analysis made available via the web interface.
Pfam 17.0 domain assignments were generated for each
sequence based on hmmpfam (http://hmmer.wustl.edu/),

sequence similarity for each group include percentage match
pairs (fraction of protein pairs aligned in the initial all-against-
all WU-BLASTP search), average E-value (based on log
5 [E-value]), average percent coverage (fraction of aligned
regions, based on the shorter sequence) and average percent
identity. In addition, MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment
(12) and BioLayout graphical visualization of sequence simi-
larities (13) are provided for groups with <100 proteins. The
10OrthoMCL-DB web interface is run by Perl CGI scripts that
implement a simple MVC (Model View Controller) architec-
ture provided by the CGI::Application Perl module. The
relational database schema and associated Perl scripts for
data loading are available from the authors.
15Species tree calculation
The unrooted species tree shown in Figure 1 was calculated
using the PHYLIP program ‘neighbor’ for neighbor joining
(14), where the distances between two species (dij) are calcu-
lated based on the number of ortholog groups shared
20 between two species (nij), normalized to account for the
number of ortholog groups observed in the two species con-
sidered separately (ni, nj):

RESULTS
OrthoMCL clustering
In this implementation of OrthoMCL, 511 797 of 627 098
protein sequences (81.6%) were clustered into 70 388 ortholog
30 groups, as summarized for each species in Table 1. In some
species—particularly those eukaryotes showing extensive
gene duplications—the number of protein sequences is
much higher than the number of ortholog groups identified.
For example, while 3295 out of 4242 Escherichia coli
35 sequences (78%) were clustered into 2536 groups (average
of 1.3 E.coli sequences/group), 78 731 of 88 149 sequences
from the Oryza sativa (rice) genome (89%) were represented
by just 18 933 groups (average of 4.2 O.sativa sequences/
group). An average of 7.3 sequences were identified per
40 ortholog group (min. 2, max. 822), representing an average
of 4.3 species (min. 1, max. 55). As a consequence of the
conservative approach used for ortholog identification,
OrthoMCL groups tend to be small, containing only a handful
of sequences from a limited number of species. In some cases,
45 ancient out-paralogs of these genes may be represented by
other groups, and protein family clustering methods such
as TribeMCL (7) could be helpful in identifying such
relationships.
A relatively non-stringent E-value threshold (1 · 105) was
50 used for inclusion of BLAST hits in the OrthoMCL graph, in
order to ensure identification of distantly diverged orthologs.
Although this might be expected to include many false posi-
tives, rules applied during group identification (reciprocal
best/better hits, Markov clustering) eliminate most poorly
55alignable sequences. Considering the entire clustered dataset,
79% of all pairs within OrthoMCL groups were recognized in
the initial BLAST search, and display an average E-
value ¼ 1 · 10114, average percent identity ¼ 53% and
average percent coverage ¼ 85%. The performance of this
60algorithm has been validated by comparison with other
ortholog identification algorithms, and assessing consistency
with EC number annotations (3).
Only six ortholog groups, representing ribosomal proteins
and tRNA synthetases, contain proteins from all 55 genomes.
65It is not surprising that so few universal ortholog groups can be
identified by similarity-based clustering alone, given the
reduced gene content of some minimalist genomes, and the
high degree of horizontal transfer and gene displacement
observed in bacterial and archaeal species. A total of 20 583
70ortholog groups contain only in-paralogs from a single species
lineage, representing both organism-specific inventions, and
ancient duplications retained in one lineage only (among those
in the dataset).
Reconstructing the tree of life from phyletic data
75The total number of shared ortholog groups for all pairwise
species comparisons (available from the OrthoMCL-DB
website as an Excel spreadsheet) can be used as an indication
of phylogenetic distance between species (15), providing the
basis for evolutionary reconstruction based on total proteomic
80evidence. The number of shared ortholog groups ranges from
a low of 54 groups representing sequences from both
Nanoarchaeum equitans and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, to
a high of 15 954 groups with members from both Mus
musculus and Rattus norvegicus. A tree of life constructed
85from these data closely reflects current understanding of
organismal evolution (Figure 1), clustering the Archaea,
Bacteria and Eukaryota in distinct groups, and clearly defining
known eukaryotic assemblages, including the Plants/Algae,
Apicomplexa and Unikonts [animals, fungi, microsporidia,
90slime molds (Dictyostelium) and amoebae (Entamoeba)] (16).
This total evidence tree reflects the evolutionary history of
complete genomes, and it is interesting to note the relatively
uniform branch lengths for all taxa, in contrast to the extreme
variations in branch length often observed for trees based on
95individual genes. Differences between the topology of this tree
and individual gene phylogenies, such as rRNA trees (17),
include the grouping of Dictyostelium, Entamoeba and micro-
sporidia with animals, and the deeper branching of Plants/
Algae than Apicomplexa within the eukaryotic world. Some
100of these differences may be explained by events producing
significant changes in gene content: gene loss, evolutionary
convergence (especially in pathogen species), endosymbiosis
and other cases of massive horizontal gene transfer. Despite
the low resolution of prokaryotic phylogeny in this analysis
105(based on a limited taxonomic sampling), the observed topol-
ogy resembles other analyses of prokaryotes (18).
OrthoMCL-DB web interface
The OrthoMCL-DB web interface provides a convenient
means to search for sequences (and their corresponding
110ortholog groups) based on protein accession number or text
keywords. In addition, a BLAST-based sequence similarity
D366 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Database issue
search function is provided, allowing users to find their
favorite sequence or identify homologs that have been clus-
tered into ortholog groups. Users are cautioned that identifying
a homolog in a given ortholog group does not necessarily
5 imply that the query sequence is in fact an ortholog to
members of that group. Ortholog groups themselves can be
searched by group accession number, or based on ortholog
group summary statistics, including group size, average pair-
wise BLAST expectation value, average pairwise percent
10 identity/coverage or percentage of matched pairs.
To further assist users in extracting biologically interesting
ortholog groups, an interface permits queries based on phyletic
patterns of conservation, using either a graphical form or text-
based expressions. Both methods allow the user to identify
15 ortholog groups by defining the desired pattern of the species
representation. The graphical form lists all 55 species, orga-
nized by taxonomic clade, with toggle buttons that the user
clicks to change status. A green check mark ‘H’ icon is used to
represent required presence of a protein from a given species
20 or clade, a red ‘x’ icon for required absence, or a gray circle
icon ‘’ meaning that the presence or absence of proteins from
this species should not affect the result. This query form may
be used, for example, to identify all groups containing proteins
found in all eukaryotes but completely absent from the
25 bacteria, regardless of their presence or absence in archaea.
For more intricate queries, such as the identification of
genes that are specifically amplified in insects, a text-based
form allows patterns to be expressed using a custom grammar
called phyletic pattern expression (PPE). Individual grammati-
30cal units of PPE expressions are composed of two parts:
(1) A species specification, composed of a three-letter species
abbreviation (e.g. ‘tgo’), or a list of species abbreviations
linked by plus sign ‘+’ (e.g. ‘tgo+pfa+hsa’). Several
abbreviations are also permitted, such as ‘BAC’ for all
35bacterial genomes, ‘EUK’ for all eukaryotic genomes,
‘API’ for all apicomplexan genomes, ‘ALL’ to represent
all 55 genomes and ‘OTHER’ to represent all other genomes
not already specified anywhere in the composite expression
(a complete list of clade abbreviations can be found in the
40website).
(2) A logical comparisonoperator, such as>,<,¼, > or<, and
a number representing the number of sequences from these
species that must be present in the ortholog group (e.g.
‘tgo>5’ specifies ortholog groups containing at least
45five in-paralogs from Toxoplasma gondii). Alternatively,
when appended with the character ‘T’ (for Taxa), this num-
ber represents the number of species that must be repre-
sented in the ortholog group. For example, ‘EUK>¼5T
AND hsa>¼10’ would generate all ortholog groups
Figure 2. AnOrthoMCL group is a cluster of sequences frommultiple species predicted to be orthologous to each other. (A) Ortholog group summary information,
including group size (# Sequences, # Taxa), BLAST statistics (%Match Pairs, Average E-value, Average% Coverage, Average% Identity) and the phyletic pattern
profile for all species in the dataset is shown. Rows in the phyletic pattern profile table represent bacteria, archaea, single-cellular eukaryotes and multi-cellular
eukaryotes (plants and animals); each box represents a single species, with black or white background denoting presence or absence in the ortholog group, and the
number of protein sequences found in the ortholog group listed.Mouse-over expands abbreviations to provide the full species name. Links at top left access a tabular
list of information for each member of the ortholog group (including links to the reference database), a graphical representation of Pfam domain architecture (B), a
BioLayout graph of pairwise similarity scores (C), a MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment (D) and a sequence retrieval option. The example shown illustrates a
‘prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase’, whose distribution is restricted to the bacteria.

representing at least five eukaryotic species and containing
at least 10 human proteins.
Multiple expression units may be combined using ‘AND’ or
‘OR’, and may use parentheses to provide explicit execution
5ordering.
OrthoMCL-DB also provides a query history page, detailing
all of the queries executed in the current session. Previous
query results may be retrieved, and separate results can be
further merged via intersection, union or subtraction opera-
10 tions, permitting very complicated queries to be generated by
combining different ortholog group query methods. For exam-
ple, the user may wish to identify ortholog groups that are
well conserved (percent identity > 70%), entirely absent in
bacteria and archaea, present in at least five eukaryotic gen-
15 omes, and expanded in Homo sapiens to include at least
10 recent paralogs.
Ortholog groups are displayed to reflect patterns of phyletic
conservation using a concise tabular form, along with sum-
mary statistics for the ortholog group and hyperlinks to view
20 or download related sequence data (Figure 2). Precomputed
information available for most ortholog groups includes
Pfam domain architecture, visualizations of OrthoMCL sim-
ilarity graphs generated using BioLayout software and multi-
ple sequence alignments generated using MUSCLE. These
25 resources provide useful insights into the evolution and organ-
ization of proteins within individual ortholog groups.
In summary, OrthoMCL-DB provides flexible web-based
access to the results of a powerful algorithm for automated
ortholog identification, applied to most of the currently avail-
30 able eukaryotic genomes and a representative selection of
prokaryotic genomes. We anticipate reclustering and updating
the database at least twice a year, as additional eukaryotic
genomes become available; inclusion of additional prokary-
otic genomes will also be considered.
35Data availability
In addition to information available for browsing and querying
via the web interface, the following data are available for bulk
download as flat-files and/or SQL export files: all protein
sequences from the current implementation of OrthoMCL-
40DB (in FASTA format), all clustering data (accession numbers
for all proteins in each ortholog group), Pfam domain assign-
ments for all proteins and summary statistics calculated for
each group. An Excel spreadsheet lists the number of ortholog
groups shared by all possible species pairs (data used to assem-
45 ble the tree shown in Figure 1). The stand-alone version of
OrthoMCL software is also downloadable.
