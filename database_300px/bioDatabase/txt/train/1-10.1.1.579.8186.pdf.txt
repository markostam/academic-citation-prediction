Abstract
PTEN mutations are among the most frequent genetic
alterations found in human prostate cancers. Our previous
works suggest that although precancerous lesions were found
in Pten heterozygous mice, cancer progression and metastasis
only happened when both alleles of Pten were deleted. To
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of
PTEN in prostate cancer control, we generated two pairs of
isogenic, androgen receptor (AR)–positive prostate epithelial
lines from intact conditional Pten knock-out mice that are
either heterozygous (PTEN-P2 and -P8) or homozygous
(PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8) for Pten deletion. Further
characterization of these cells showed that loss of the second
allele of Pten leads to increased anchorage-independent
growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo without obvious
structural or numerical chromosome changes based on SKY
karyotyping analysis. Despite no prior exposure to hormone
ablation therapy, Pten null cells are tumorigenic in both male
and female severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Fur-
thermore, knocking down PTEN can convert the androgen-
dependent Myc-CaP cell into androgen independence, suggesting
that PTEN intrinsically controls androgen responsiveness,
a critical step in the development of hormone refractory
prostate cancer. Importantly, knocking down AR by shRNA in
Pten null cells reverses androgen-independent growth in vitro
and partially inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo , indicating that
PTEN-controlled prostate tumorigenesis is AR dependent.
These cell lines will serve as useful tools for understanding
signaling pathways controlled by PTEN and elucidating the
molecular mechanisms involved in hormone refractory
prostate cancer formation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6083–91]
Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related
death among North American men (1). Despite improved early
detection and initial positive response to androgen ablation
therapies, almost all patients eventually develop hormone refrac-
tory prostate cancer (HRPC). The molecular mechanisms leading
to the progression of HRPC are still poorly understood (2), with
proposed hypotheses ranging from gain of function mutations
under hormone deprivation to intrinsic properties of certain
prostate cancer cells (3).
Among genetic alterations frequently found in human prostate
cancers, PTEN loss of function has been strongly implicated in
prostate cancer development (4, 5). The etiologic role of PTEN in
prostate tumorigenesis is further supported by studying animal
models with prostate-specific deletion of its murine homologue,
the Pten gene (6–8). In contrast to conventional heterozygous Pten
deletion (6, 9, 10), conditional deletion of both alleles of Pten
significantly reduces the latency of prostate intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) lesion development and further progression to
localized adenocarcinoma followed by metastasis (6–8). Therefore,
the onset and progression of prostate cancer are PTEN dosage
dependent (6). Similar to the majority of human prostate cancers,
Pten null murine prostate cancer initially regress in response to
androgen ablation therapy, but subsequently relapse and prolifer-
ate in the absence of androgens (7). Therefore, the Pten prostate
cancer model (7) provides an ideal system for studying the
mechanism of HRPC (11).
To our knowledge, the most well-studied human prostate cancer
cell lines such as LNCaP (12), PC3 (13), and DU145 (14) are derived
from late-stage cancer samples after hormone ablation therapy and
therefore, are not ideal for studying the processes involved in
HRPC. To circumvent this, we attempted to establish primary cell
lines from intact Pten conditional knock-out mice (7). Here, we
report the establishment and characterization of two pairs of
isogenic cell lines and their usage to address (a) whether prostatic
epithelial cells can acquire androgen independency without
androgen deprivation and (b) the relationship between loss of
PTEN and androgen-independent growth.
Materials and Methods
Establishment of primary cell lines from Pten prostate cancer
model. Prostate cancer tissue was dissected from a 10-month intact
Ptenloxp/loxp;PB-Cre4+ mouse (7), minced, and digested with 0.5% type I
collagenase (Invitrogen) using the same protocol as the generation of Myc-
CaP line (15). After filtering through a 40-Am mesh, the fragments trapped
by the mesh were plated in tissue culture dishes coated with type I collagen
(BD Pharmingen). Several cell populations with distinct epithelial
morphology were observed in the confluent monolayer developed from
the tissue fragments. Cells with typical epithelial morphology were
collected, and single cell was plated into each well of a 96-well plate.
The PTEN-P2 and PTEN-P8 cell lines were independently established
as spontaneously immortalized lines. The lines were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Omega Scientific),
25 Ag/mL bovine pituitary extract, 5 Ag/mL bovine insulin, and 6 ng/mL
recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich). The PTEN-
CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 were generated by infecting PTEN-P2 or PTEN-P8 cell

lines with Cre-retrovirus followed by 2 weeks of puromycin selection. Cells
were genotyped by standard genomic PCR techniques, and the three
primers used were 5¶-TCCCAGAGTTCATACCAGGA-3¶, 5¶-GCAATGGCCAG-
TACTAGTGAAC-3¶, and 5¶-AATCTGTGCATGAAGGGAAC-3¶.
Real-time PCR. Total RNAs from culture cells were extracted with
RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA with
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen), and
quantitative PCR was done in the iQ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) using the iQ
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and in triplicate. Results were analyzed by
the relative quantification method and expressed as relative RNA levels.
DCT was calculated by normalizing the threshold difference of certain gene
x with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The relative RNA level
was then calculated by normalizing the DCT to the least abundant RNA
species, which was arbitrarily set to 15. The relative RNA level of gene x is
thus equal to 15-DCT(x). Primers for OAS2 and IFNB1 were from
Superarray. All other PCR primers were synthesized by Operon Biotechnol-
ogies and designed for the mouse sequence unless otherwise specified. The
following primer pairs were used: AR forward, 5¶-AACCAACCAGATTCC-

Western analysis. Protein lysates were prepared from confluent cells by
adding radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer as described (16). Protein
lysate (50 Ag) was resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis
using anti-PTEN (9552, Cell Signaling Technologies), AR (N-20, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), P-AKT (9271, Cell Signaling Technologies), total AKT (9272,
Cell Signaling Technologies), Nkx3.1 (sc-15022, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
Cre (MAB3120, Chemicon), p21(sc-471, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p27
(sc-1641, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), E-cadherin (610181, BD Biosciences),
and h-actin (5441, Sigma) antibodies, respectively.
Spectral karyotyping analysis. Cells were harvested after mitotic
arrest with colcemid (0.05 Ag/mL) for 2 h. Hypotonization was done with
0.075 mol/L KCl, and a 3:1 mixture of methanol and glacial acetic acid
was used for fixation. Slides underwent SKY [Applied Spectral Imaging
(ASI)] hybridization, posthybridization, and analyses following ASI’s
recommended procedures. The probe cocktail contained 20 differentially
labeled chromosome-specific painting probes and Cot-1 blocking DNA.
Image acquisition was done using a SD300 Spectracube system (ASI)
mounted in an Olympus BX60 microscope with a custom-designed optical
filter (SKY-1, Chroma Technology). Ploidy was defined by the chromosome
count for each metaphase and was noted by a specific range.
Chromosomal gain and/or loss were determined by the average of the
observed copy number F 25%. Any structural abnormality seen in two or
more cells was considered clonal. On average, 15 cells per cell line were
analyzed.
In vitro cell growth assay. For the Casodex treatment experiment, cells
(5  104 cells per plate) were plated in medium containing 10% FBS with or
without 10 Amol/L Casodex for 3 days. To determine cell growth in
charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) medium, cells were seeded into six-well
plates at 5  104 cells per well in the maintenance media containing 10%
FBS for 16 h. Plates were then cultured in 4% CSS medium for 5 or 6 days.
Cell proliferation was determined by trypsinizing and counting live cells
using trypan blue dye exclusion method every 2 days. Each cell line was
assayed in triplicate, and the assay was repeated twice.
Soft agar colony formation assay. Cells were plated at a density of
10,000 cells per plate in 0.3% agar on 6-cm tissue culture dishes coated with
0.6% agar in DMEM growth medium. Twenty days after plating, plates were
stained with 0.5 mL 0.005% crystal violet. Colonies were counted under a
light microscope (4). Only colonies larger than 0.1 mm diameter were
included.
Viral transduction. Androgen receptor (AR) knockdown was achieved
by infecting PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 cells with pSIREN-RetroQ-DsRed
(pSRQ-R, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) retrovirus expressing AR-specific
short hairpin RNA (shRNA).
AR shRNA-1 primer: 5¶-GATCCGCGATTGTACCATTGATAAATTCAAGA-

BamHI-EcoRI site of pSRQ-R, and positive clones were confirmed by
sequencing. pSRQ-R/AR–shRNA or control vector containing control shRNA
(Clontech) and packaging plasmid were transfected into 293T packaging
cells individually, and the collected retrovirus was used to infect PTEN-CaP2
and PTEN-CaP8 cells. Cre recombinase virus was made by transfecting
pMSCV-puro-Cre and ecotropic packaging plasmid into 293T cells. To
knockdown PTEN expression in Myc-CaP, cells were infected with lentivirus
expressing either GFP or PTEN-specific shRNA (17).
In vivo tumor formation study. Cells (1  106) were first mixed with
Matrigel (BD Bioscience) solution at a ratio of 1:1 and then inoculated s.c.
into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (V3 months of age).
Tumor formation was monitored for 3 to 8 weeks. Tumor size was
determined by caliper measurements, and tumor volume was calculated by
a rational ellipse formula (m1  m1  m2  0.5236, where m1 is the short
axis and m2 is the long axis). To examine the role of PTEN in androgen-
independent tumor formation, 72 h after viral infection, infected Myc-CaP
cells were replated in CSS medium for an additional 2 days, and then cells
(2  105) were injected into flanks of precastrated SCID or intact SCID mice.
Histology and immunohistochemical analysis. Histologic and immu-
nochemical analyses were done as described (16). Briefly, formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded (PFPE) sections were stained with H&E or specific
antibodies to AR (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Ki67 (VP-RM04,
Vector Laboratories) as described (7). For immunofluorescence staining,
pretreated sections were first blocked and then incubated with monoclonal
antibody against CK8 (MMS162-P, Covance), SMA (M0851, DAKO) at room
temperature for 30 min, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor-594 goat
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; H+L; 1:1,000; Molecular Probes).
Sections were counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy.
Statistical analysis. All data were presented as means F SE. Statistical
calculations were done with Microsoft Excel analysis tools. Differences
between individual groups were analyzed by paired t test. P values of <0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Establishment and characterization of two isogenic pros-
tatic epithelial cell lines from the Pten conditional knock-out
model. To facilitate our investigation of the molecular mechanisms
underlying PTEN-controlled prostate tumorigenesis, we isolated
primary prostatic cells from an intact Ptenloxp/loxp;PB-Cre4+ mouse
using the same protocol as the generation of Myc-CaP line (15).
After serial passages and spontaneous immortalization (see
Materials and Methods for details), several clonally derived cell
lines were established and from which two lines, named PTEN-P2
and PTEN-P8, were further characterized and studied herein.
Our initial genotyping analysis suggested that PTEN-P2 and
PTEN-P8 were heterozygous for Pten deletion, although the Cre

transgene could be easily detected in both lines (Fig. 1A, lanes 1
and 3). To rule out possible contamination, two additional rounds
of subcloning were done, which further confirmed the heterozy-
gous status of these two lines (data not shown). The incomplete
deletion of Pten loxp alleles led us to further investigate the Cre
transgene expression, which is under the control of a modified rat
probasin promoter (18). Western blot analysis showed very low to
undetectable Cre protein expression (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3) and
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis con-
firmed significant down-regulation of the endogenous probasin
gene in both cell lines (Fig. 1C). Our recent finding showed that
probasin is positively regulated by PTEN (16) through NKX3.1 (19):
in the absence of PTEN, NKX3.1 expression as well as its
downstream target genes, including probasin, are significantly
down-regulated to undetectable levels in both human and murine
prostate cancer tissues. Consistent with our recent finding (16),
Western blot analysis showed very low to undetectable Nkx3.1
expression in both PTEN-P2 and PTEN-P8 lines (Fig. 1B). Cre
expression, on the other hand, was significantly enhanced when a
NKX3.1-expressing vector was transfected into these cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1A).
We then infected PTEN-P2 and PTEN-P8 lines with a retrovirus
carrying Cre and puromycin-resistant cassette and the resulting
isogenic lines, PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 were generated after
2 weeks of drug selection. PCR-based genotyping and Western
analysis showed that PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 had indeed lost
the second Ptenloxp allele and are null for PTEN function, as evident
by the loss of PTEN protein expression and increased P-AKT levels
(Fig. 1A and B, lanes 2 and 4). Interestingly, deletion of the second
allele of Pten led to increased AR expression in the PTEN-CaP2
cells (comparing AR levels in Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2 , and quantified
in Supplementary Fig. S1B), consistent with our previous finding
that PTEN serves as a negative regulator for AR expression (16).
To determine the cellular origin of these established cell lines, we
did Q-RT-PCR analysis using primers corresponding to phenotypic
markers for the major cell types in the prostate epithelium. As
shown in Fig. 1C , all lines coexpress both basal (CK14, AR) and
luminal cell (CK8/CK18, AR) but not neuroendocrine markers
(Fig. 1C). Furthermore, PSCA, a marker that represents an
intermediate stage between basal and luminal cells, the transient
amplified cell population (20), is also highly expressed in all four
cell lines (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest that the

parental PTEN-P2 and P8 lines were derived from epithelial cells
and display similar expression patterns with the transient amplified
cells (20).
Loss of the second allele of Pten does not cause global
chromosomal alterations. Recent findings (21) have shown a
novel nuclear function for PTEN in controlling chromosomal
integrity. Chromosomal aberrations have previously been linked to
the progression of prostate cancer (22). To examine whether there
were any chromosome alterations between the isogenic prostate
cells, we did karyotyping analyses using a combination of SKY and
G-banding tests (Fig. 2). As summarized in Supplementary Table
S1, our study revealed several structural and numerical alterations
in each pair: PTEN-P2 and PTEN-CaP2 (Supplementary Fig. S2)
contained near-tetraploid chromosome number, with 65 to 84
chromosomes in PTEN-P2 and 76 to 80 chromosomes in PTEN-
CaP2, respectively; PTEN-P8 and PTEN-CaP8 had near 6N
chromosomes with 113 to 125 chromosomes in PTEN-P8 and 115
to 129 chromosomes in PTEN-CaP8. Importantly, loss of the second
allele of Pten did not cause further global structural or numerical
changes under our in vitro culture conditions, at least within the
sensitivities offered by SKY and G-banding analyses. Interestingly,
all of the lines analyzed share several common chromosomal
alterations that are highlighted in Supplementary Table S1,
including del(7)C-F, +10, and a heteromorphous chromosome
8 with a very small centromere, which may either support their
common origin or reflect basic genetic alterations required for
immortalization of epithelial cells (23). Significantly, loss of the Y
chromosome, which is one of the most frequent cytogenic changes
observed in human sporadic prostate tumors (22), was observed in
PTEN-P8 and PTEN-CaP8.
PTEN loss leads to increased anchorage-independent
growth in vitro and increased tumorigenic potential in vivo.
As a tumor suppressor, PTEN loss is often associated with a gain of
transformation potential (24) as PTEN negatively regulates cell
cycle progression, cell migration, and cell survival (25). To
determine whether Pten loss of heterozygosity leads to enhanced
transformation potential, soft agar assay was employed to examine
the colony-forming efficiency of Pten null cells. After 20 days in
culture, colonies were photographed and counted. PTEN-CaP2 and
PTEN-CaP8 cells formed 5- and 2.5-fold more colonies compared
with their parental heterozygous cells, respectively (Fig. 3A, left). In
addition, the sizes of Pten null colonies were generally larger than
those of heterozygous ones (Fig. 3A, right). PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-
CaP8 cells also expressed decreased levels of the G1 cell cycle
inhibitor p27, as compared with their isogenic heterozygous pairs
(Fig. 3B). Interestedly, complete loss of PTEN also caused decreased
E-cadherin expression (Fig. 3B), a molecule critically important for
cell-cell adhesion and tumor invasion (26).
Studies from our group and others showed that PTEN dosage
plays a critical role in determining both the onset and progression
of prostate cancer (6–10). To examine whether the cell lines we
generated could mimic the biological differences between Pten
heterozygous and homozygous mutants in vivo , we next checked
their tumorigenic potentials in immune incompetent SCID mice.
Equal number of cells (1  106) was injected s.c. into the flank of
male SCID mice, and tumor growth was monitored on a daily basis.
Both Pten null lines (PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8) were tumori-
genic with a latency of 3 weeks. However, no tumor formation
could be detected when the same number of Pten heterozygous
cells (PTEN-P2 and PTEN-P8) were inoculated and followed up to
4 months (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the dosage effect of PTEN in
tumorigenesis control can be recapitulated in these isogenic lines.
Histologic analysis indicated that all xenograft tumors maintained
AR expression and were positive for the luminal epithelial marker
CK8 but not for the mesenchymal marker smooth muscle actin
(SMA; Fig. 3D). Consistent with our Q-RT-PCR result, no neuro-
endocrine marker expression could be detected (data not shown).
Loss of PTEN promotes androgen-independent growth.
Similar to human prostate cancers, Pten null murine prostate
cancers do progress to HRPC after castration (7). To understand
whether HRPC development requires additional genetic changes
under low androgen levels, we tested the likelihood of the

androgen-independent growth and tumor-forming potential of
these cell lines that have never been exposed to such a selective
pressure.
We first examined the cell growth property in the presence of
androgen antagonist Casodex, a potent, nonsteroidal antiandrogen
drug that has been shown to have robust inhibitory effects on the
growth of human prostate tumor cell lines, including the androgen-
dependent cell line LNCaP (27). Consistent with previous reports
(27), Casodex efficiently inhibited LNCaP cell growth but had little
effect on the PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 lines we generated in this
study (Fig. 4A), indicating that the growth properties of these cell
lines are not significantly changed with the addition of Casodex.
Additionally, both PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 remained prolifer-
ative in the CSS medium (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We then examined the tumor formation in vivo in female SCID
mice. Remarkably, both PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 could form
tumors in female SCID mice with similar frequency and latency as
in males (Fig. 4B). Histologic examination showed no detectable
difference in tumors formed by each cell line in either female or
male SCID mice. Ki67 index further confirmed similar proliferation
potentials of xenograft tumors generated in both male and female
recipient mice (Fig. 4C ; Supplementary Fig. S4).
To further explore the relationship between loss of PTEN and
androgen independence, we first compared the PTEN-CaP lines
with the Myc-CaP line we generated recently (15). Although
established using an identical culture condition, Myc-CaP cells
cannot grow in the androgen-ablated environment in vivo (15).
Therefore, the androgen-independent nature of PTEN-CaP cells is
unlikely due to the in vitro culture procedure. Interestingly, we did
not find del(7)C-F, +10 chromosome abnormalities in Myc-CaP
(data not shown) as what we have observed in PTEN-CaP2 and
PTEN-CaP8 lines. Whether these chromosome abnormalities play a

role in the development of androgen independence is an open
question and deserves further investigation.
To further examine whether loss of PTEN plays an intrinsic role
in androgen independence, we accessed the impact of PTEN loss
on the androgen responsiveness of Myc-CaP cells. Significantly,
when infected by a lentivirus-carrying PTEN shRNA (17), Myc-CaP/
PTEN-shRNA cells, but not cells infected with empty vector
(Fig. 5A), became tumorigenic on both precastrated or intact SCID
male mice (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data suggest that PTEN
plays a critical role in determining the androgen-independent
growth potential of prostatic epithelial cells.
AR is required for PTEN-controlled HRPC. Loss of PTEN and
enhanced AR activity represent two common features of human
prostate cancer, especially in HRPC (28). Unfortunately, among
various prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 is null for both PTEN and AR
(13), DU145 expresses PTEN but has AR loss (14), and LNCaP has
mutated AR and PTEN loss (12). The Pten null prostatic epithelial
cell lines we generated are AR positive without detectable
mutations in the AR coding region (data not shown) and, therefore,
can be used to address the relationship between PTEN loss and
enhanced AR function. To evaluate the functional significance of
AR in PTEN-controlled androgen-independent growth, we used AR
shRNA to knockdown endogenous AR expression. Several short
hairpins were generated corresponding to three different AR
coding regions (29), and after initial analysis, two that showed most
significant inhibitory effect were chosen for further functional

studies. As shown in Fig. 6A , the endogenous AR expression in
PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 cells was reduced to almost
undetectable levels upon shRNA-1 treatment, but shRNA-2 had
less effect. At the same time, the G1 cell cycle inhibitors p21 and
p27 levels were significantly increased (Fig. 6A).
A growing body of evidence suggests that siRNA could generate
off-target effects through different mechanisms (30–32). To exclude
the potential effects of nonspecific IFN response by siRNA, we
assessed the induction of 2¶-5¶oligoadenylate synthetase (OSA1),
2¶-5¶ oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), and IFNh1 (IFNB1), three
classic IFN target genes. As shown in Fig. 6B , no significant
differences in OSA1, OAS2 , as well as IFNB1 mRNA levels were
detected when we compared with cells bearing control shRNA and
AR shRNA-1 (Fig. 6B), indicating that the effect of AR shRNA was
not mediated by general IFNh response.
To further measure the biological effects of AR knockdown in
Pten null cells, we first compared cell growth properties with
control shRNA or AR shRNA-1 in androgen-ablated conditions. As
shown in Fig. 6C , cell proliferation rates were significantly reduced
in both PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 cells infected by AR shRNA-1,
suggesting that AR plays an essential role in the cell cycle
progression of Pten null prostatic epithelial cells. Importantly, AR
knockdown significantly impaired the in vivo tumorigenic poten-
tials of Pten null cells in female SCID mice (Fig. 6D). Taken
together, our results indicate that AR is required for PTEN-
controlled androgen-independent prostate tumorigenesis.
Discussion
One major obstacle to exploring the mechanisms underlying
HRPC progression is the shortage of good model systems, either
in vivo or in vitro , that can truly reflect human prostate cancer
progression. The Pten murine prostate cancer model provides a
valuable resource for studying the mechanism of HRPC (7). Here
we report the characterization of two pairs of isogenic prostate cell
lines established from the Pten null prostate cancer model. These
Figure 6. AR is required for PTEN-controlled androgen-independent tumorigenesis. A, knockdown AR expression caused a significant increased in p21 and
p27 expression. PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 were retrovirally infected with AR-specific shRNAs (shRNA-1 or shRNA-2 ) or control shRNA (Con ). Seventy-two hours
after infection, cells were harvested, and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. B, AR knockdown in PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8
does not induce significant IFN response. Seventy-two hours after AR-shRNA-1 or control-shRNA infection, infected PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 from (A) were
seeded in CSS medium for additional 2 d. The OAS1, OAS2, IFNB gene induction was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and presented as relative fold of
change. C, AR shRNA leads to significantly decreased growth rates in PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 cells. Seventy-two hours after AR-shRNA or control-shRNA
infection, infected PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 from (A ) were seeded at 5  104 per well in six wells in triplicate containing CSS medium, and cell numbers were
counted every 2 d. Columns, mean; bars, SD. D, AR knockdown impairs androgen-independent tumor growth. Con-PTEN-CaP2, AR-shRNA-PTEN-CaP2 and

Role of Pten in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer

murine prostate cancer cell lines not only mimic the biological
difference between Pten heterozygous and homozygous mutants
in vivo , but also provide the molecular insight into the critical role
of PTEN in tumorigenesis and androgen responsiveness. Loss of
PTEN enables cells to acquire transforming abilities without a
significant change in global chromosome structure. Furthermore,
loss of PTEN promotes androgen-independent growth in vitro and
in vivo . Knockdown of PTEN expression, on the other hand, is
sufficient to convert androgen-dependent Myc-CaP cells to
androgen-independent growth, indicating PTEN’s intrinsic role in
regulating androgen-dependent growth. Using a shRNA approach,
our study further shows the critical role of AR in PTEN-controlled
androgen-independent tumorigenesis. Collectively, the murine cell
lines established from our study can be used as research tools and
may provide a unique opportunity for exploring both the molecular
mechanism underlying HRPC and the development of new targeted
therapies.
One interesting observation we made was that the two original
spontaneously immortalized lines are Pten heterozygous, although
the mouse from which the cell lines were generated was
clearly Ptenloxp/loxp;PBCre4+ . There are several explanations for this
result. First, although the majority prostate epithelial cells in
Ptenloxp/loxp;PBCre4+ mice are PTEN null, minor PTEN-positive
stained cells can be detected in these mutant mice (7, 16). This may
be due to the relative lower Cre activity in the basal cell compart-
ment as a result of low AR expression (33, 34). Therefore, it is not
surprising to see the existence of Pten heterozygous cells in the
prostate cancer derived from Ptenloxp/loxp;PBCre4+ . Secondly,
in vitro spontaneous immortalization methods may preferentially
enrich certain types of prostate cells. Primary mouse epithelial cell
lines derived from genetically engineered mouse prostate cancer
models including TRAMP-C1 (35), Myc-CaP (15), and our established
lines here all share similar expression of PSCA, amarker for transient
amplified cell population (20). Luminal cells with higher AR and
probasin expressions and complete PTEN deletion may be selected
out during this long-term establishment procedure. Thirdly, the Cre
gene expression was silenced in part due to the feedback loop of
PTEN-NKX-AR that can shutdown probasin promoter activity after
Pten deletion (ref. 16; see Supplementary Fig. S1A).
HRPC development is a complex process including clonal
selection and adaptation (3). It has been postulated that the
failure of androgen ablation therapy and development of HRPC
might be due to a subpopulation of androgen-independent tumor
cells being present even before therapy was initiated (36). Indeed,
Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice can develop androgen-independent
phenotypes well before they display overt PIN or cancer
phenotypes (37). Because we can successfully isolate androgen-
independent primary cell lines from a primary prostate tumor that
has never been exposed to hormonal ablation, our study further
supports this hypothesis that acquisition of androgen indepen-
dence can be uncoupled from hormone deprivation pressure and
selection (37).
With recent evidence suggesting that loss of PTEN is associated
with progression to HRPC (28, 37, 38), our study further
underscores the critical role of PTEN in HRPC development. We
showed that complete loss of PTEN causes decreased p27 and
E-cadherin expression, which may contribute to the enhanced gain
of transformation ability in PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8. Signifi-
cantly, knockdown of PTEN in Myc-CaP cells is sufficient to change
its androgen dependency. Collectively, our study showed that PTEN
can functionally control ‘‘two’’ hits: cell transformation and
androgen-independent growth in the course of HRPC tumor
development.
Mounting evidence suggests that AR plays an important role in
prostate cancer progression (39–41). Although AR remains critical
for cell-cycle progression in androgen-independent CWR22 (42)
and LAPC4 (43), the specific role of AR in PTEN-controlled HRPC
progression has not been clearly defined yet. Knocking down
endogenous AR expression in PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8 cells by
shRNA abolishes androgen-independent growth in vitro , which in
part may be due to the increased expression of cell cycle inhibitor
p21 and p27 and less tumorigenicity in vivo in female SCID mice.
Therefore, our study provides evidence that HRPC development
caused by PTEN loss is androgen independent but AR dependent.
Further study will be critical to ascertain whether AR is required for
the onset of PIN and whether AR is essential for the acquisition of
AI prostate cancer in our Pten prostate cancer model.
