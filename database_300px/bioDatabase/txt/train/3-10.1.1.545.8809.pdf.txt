ABSTRACT
Sox9 is a transcription factor of the SRY family
required for several steps of chondrogenesis. It
activates the expression of various chondrocyte-
specific genes, but the mechanisms and role of
cofactors involved in Sox9-regulated gene trans-
cription are not fully understood. Here, we report on
the characterization of a Tat interactive protein-60
(Tip60) as Sox9-associated protein identified in a
yeast two-hybrid screen. Both in vitro and in vivo
assays confirmed the specificity of interactions
between Sox9 and Tip60 including the existence of
an endogenous complex containing both polypep-
tides in chondrocytes. Gel shift assays showed the
presence of a complex containing Sox9, Tip60 and
the DNA of an enhancer region of the Col2a1
promoter. Reporter assays using a Col2a1 promoter
with multimerized Col2a1 Sox9-binding sites indi-
cated that Tip60 enhanced the transcriptional
activity of Sox9. A larger Col2a1 promoter showed
that Tip60 increased the activity of this promoter
in the presence of both Sox9 and Sox5. Ectopic
expression of Sox9 and transient-cotransfection
with Tip60 in COS7 cells showed a more diffuse
subnuclear colocalization, suggesting changes in
the chromatin structure. Chromatin immunoprecipi-
tation assays showed that Tip60, Sox9 and Sox5
associated with the same Col2a1 enhancer region.
Consistent with a role of Tip60 in chondrogenesis,
addition of Tip60 siRNA to limb-bud micromass
cultures delayed chondrocyte differention. Tip60
enhances acetylation of Sox9 mainly through K61,
253, 398 residues; however, the K61/253/398A
mutant of Sox9 still exhibited enhanced transcrip-
tional activity by Tip60. Our results support the
hypothesis that Tip60 is a coactivator of Sox9 in
chondrocytes.
INTRODUCTION
Regulated changes in chromatin structure play a central
role in the control of gene transcription (1). Posttransla-
tional modiﬁcations of nucleosomal histones have been
proposed to inﬂuence chromatin structure and to create a
code that is interpreted by positive and negative transcrip-
tional regulators recognizing speciﬁc histone modiﬁca-
tions. Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyl
transferase (HAT), promotes gene transcription by relax-
ing the chromatin structure, thereby facilitating access of
the transcriptional machinery to DNA target sequences
(1–3). The transcription-activating eﬀect of histone
acetylation is counterbalanced by histone deacetylation,
which favors chromatin condensation and transcriptional
repression (4).
Sox9, a transcription factor of the SRY (sex-
determining region, Y-chromosome) family (5), is required
for the establishment and diﬀerentiation of several cell
lineages including chondrocytes (6–8), Sertoli cells of
male gonads (9), glial cells of the nervous system in
the spinal chord (10), Paneth cells in the intestine and
others (11,12). During chondrocyte diﬀerentiation Sox9 is
expressed abundantly in mouse chondroprogenitor cells
and overtly diﬀerentiated chondrocytes. It regulates
transcription of cartilage-speciﬁc extracellular matrix
molecules such as collagen types II, IX, XI and aggrecan
(6–8). Heterozygous mutations in the Sox9 gene cause

campomelic dysplasia, a severe skeletal malformation
syndrome characterized by a generalized hypoplasia of
endochondral bones (13). Sox9 inactivation studies in
mice indicate that Sox9 has an essential role at several
steps of chondrogenic diﬀerentiation including mesench-
ymal condensations and overt diﬀerentiation of chondro-
cytes (14). In the absence of Sox9, no chondrocyte marker
genes are expressed (7,13,14) but the precise mechanism of
transcriptional activation of cartilage-speciﬁc genes by
Sox9 is only poorly understood.
Members of the Sox family of transcription factors
contain a high-mobility group (HMG) box DNA-binding
domain that is at least 50% identical with an equivalent-
domain in the sex-determining factor SRY (15–17). Sox9
also contains a potent transcription activation domain
located at its carboxyl end (18) and a dimerization
domain, needed for full activity in chondrocytes, located
between the N-terminus and the DNA-binding domain
(19,20). Previous experiments have shown that two other
members of the Sox family, Sox5 and Sox6, cooperated
with Sox9 to activate the Col2a1 and aggrecan genes
(7,21,22). In Sox5 and Sox6, double mutants overt
diﬀerentiation of chondrocytes is severely inhibited (23).
Because Sox9 is required for the diﬀerentiation of
several cell lineages, which are characterized by very
diﬀerent genetic programs (10,24), other transcription
factors should provide speciﬁcity to the function of Sox9
in each of these cell types. In vivo, this speciﬁcity needs
additional factors besides Sox5 and Sox6 since these three
Sox proteins are coexpressed in other cell types besides
diﬀerentiating chondrocytes (9,25,26). In order to identify
Sox9-associated polypeptides, a yeast two-hybrid screen
was performed using a human chondrocytic cell line,
HCS-2/8 (27). One of the factors identiﬁed as a Sox9
interacting protein was Tip60, originally described as
a coactivator for the human immunodeﬁciency virus TAT
protein (28). Tip60 is a member of the MYST family (2,29)
of related chromatin polypeptides. It mainly acetylates
histone H4, modulates DNA-damage response signaling,
which is triggered by oncogenes, and controls cell cycle
checkpoints and apoptosis(28). Haplo-insuﬃciency of
Tip60 causes tumorigenesis through DNA-damage (30).
Recent data suggest that Tip60 is a tightly regulated
transcriptional coactivator for androgen- (31), estrogen-
(32) and progesterone- (32) receptors. It also acts as a
coactivator of p53 in activation of the p21 promoter and
has been found on c-Myc and NFKB target genes
(29,33,34). Tip60 is expressed transiently during early
heart development (35). Our results indicate that Tip60
enhances Sox9 activation and Sox5-mediated Sox9 trans-
activation, and thus may be a key regulator of
chondrogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screen and constructs
Yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as described
previously (36). Full-length and truncated cDNAs of
Sox9 were prepared as baits by PCR ampliﬁcation and
cloned into pGBKT7 vector containing the DNA-binding
domain of GAL4. For screening, a cDNA library from the
human chondrocytic cell line HCS-2/8 was constructed in
the EcoRI site of the pGADT7 vector, which includes
the GAL4-activation domain (AD). A total of 5 106
independent cDNA clones with an average insert size of
2.4 kb (range: 2.0–4.0 kb) was obtained. Aliquots of
50 mg of the resulting cDNA library were then individually
transformed into AH109 yeast cells that had been
transformed with a Sox9-bait containing amino acids
26–189 or 26–415, and screened on selection-plates lacking
leucine, tryptophan and adenine, and containing 3-AT
and X-gal. After 3–5 days incubation, positive clones were
picked, and plasmid DNA was re-transformed into
Escherichia coli DH5a strain for further cloning and
sequencing.
To conﬁrm the binding speciﬁcity of Tip60, a pGADT7
vector expressing full-length Tip60 was re-transformed in
the AH105 yeast strain together with the pGBKT7 vector
expressing either full-length or truncated forms of Sox9.
The empty pGADT7 vector was also re-transformed
together with the same series of Sox9 truncations as
control. All double transformants were cultured in
SD/-Trp/-Leu selection medium, equal numbers of cells
were collected and cellular proteins prepared by 3-fold
freezingand thawing in yeastZbuﬀer (0.1MNa-phosphate,
pH 7.0, 20mM KCl, 1mM MgSO4). To measure the
binding strength between Tip60 and either full-length or
truncated forms of Sox9, b-galactosidase activity of the
reporter gene was measured, standardized to protein
concentration and subtracted with the b-galactosidase
activity obtained after cotransformation of the pGADT7
empty vector with the same series of Sox9 polypeptides.
A Sox9 expression vector (pcDNA/HA3Sox9) was
kindly provided by Dr Shunichi Murakami (M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USA). Full-length Sox9
linked to a 3 multimerized hemaglutinin (HA) tag at its
N-terminal was cloned into the pcDNA-50UT vector (37).
For generation of pEGFP-Tip60, Tip60 cDNA frag-
ments were prepared by PCR using primer set of
EGFPTip30: 50-gCCgAATTCTCACCACTTCCCCCTCT
TgCTCCAgT-30 and EGFPTip50: 50-CTCAgATCTATgg
CggAggTgggggAgATAATCgAg-30, and pGADT7/Tip60
vector as a template, and cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector
(Clontech, CA, USA). A Sox5 (L-Sox5) expression vector
was described previously (22). Wild-type and K61/
253/398A Flag-Sox9-His expression vector were used
previously (36).
Purification of recombinant proteins and production
of antibody
For preparation of puriﬁed recombinant Sox9 protein, an
HA-tag was coupled to the Sox9 gene by PCR and
subcloned into the pBACgus-2cp vector which carries a
His and S-tag, and transfected into Sf-9 insect cells for
expression of recombinant proteins. The expressed Sox9
protein was puriﬁed with Ni–NTA agarose (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) (36). For Tip60 recombinant protein,
Tip60 cDNA was ampliﬁed by PCR and subcloned into
pBACgus-2cp vector, and transfected into Sf-9 cells:
Expressed S- and His-tagged Tip60 protein was puriﬁed

with Ni–NTA agarose. Tip60 cDNA was also excised
from pBACgus-2cp/Tip60 vector, and re-subcloned
into pGEX-6P vector (GE Healthcare, NJ, USA). The
pGEX-6P/Tip60 vector was transformed into E. coli
BL21(DE3)pLysS Rosetta strain, and expressed GST-
tagged Tip60 protein was immobilized onto glutathione–
Sepharose-4B (GE Healthcare).
Cell culture and DNA transfections
COS7 monkey kidney cells, and HCS-2/8 human chon-
drosarcoma cells and human primary synovial cells were
maintained in Dullbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). Transient transfection experiments were performed
using Fugene 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Knock-
down experiments were performed with siRNAs for
Tip60. This Tip60 siRNA, derived from mouse sequences,
also recognize the corresponding human sequences. The
sequences of the top strands of the siRNAs were as
follows: Tip60-1: 50-ACGGAAGGUGGAGGUGGUU-
dTdT-30 control-1: 50-CAUGUCAUGUGUCACAUCU-
dTdT-30 (33). Transfection of siRNA was performed with
X-tremeGENE (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Luciferase reporter gene assay
Activities of the p89 (4 48) and p3000i3020 Col2a1-
luciferase reporter (37,38) and that of the internal control
pCMV/b-galactosidase or pGL3 (luciferase) were mea-
sured 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested in lysis
buﬀer containing 0.1M potassium buﬀer, pH 7.8, 1mM
dithiothreitol and 0.2% TritonX-100 and luciferase and
b-galactosidase activity measured as described previously
(36,39).
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
For both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, cells
were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buﬀered saline
(PBS) and lyzed with lysis buﬀer (50mM Tris–HCl, pH
7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and
1mM PMSF). After brief sonication, the lysates were
centrifuged at 48C, and protein concentration was
measured. For immunoblotting, the cell lysates were
boiled with 2  SDS-sample buﬀer (0.125M Tris–HCl,
pH6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% mercaptoethanol,
0.02% bromphenol blue). For immunoprecipitation, the
lysates were incubated with antibody and proteinG–
Sepharose CL-4B (GE Heathcare) for 4 h at 48C. The
immunocomplexes were washed ﬁve times with the same
lysis buﬀer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were
removed from the protein G agarose by boiling in 2
SDS-sample buﬀer and loaded on SDS–PAGE.
Polypeptides were transferred to PVDF membranes;
membranes were treated with a primary antibody and
then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody. Bound antibody was detected by ECL
chemiluminescene (ECL, GE Healthcare) and exposed to
X-ray ﬁlm.
GST pull-down assay
HA-tagged full-length Sox9 and truncated Sox9 cDNAs
were transcribed and translated in vitro in 50 ml of reaction
mixture using TnT-T7-Quick Coupled Transcription/
translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Ten
percent of the reaction mixtures were mixed with SDS-
sample buﬀer and directly analyzed by SDS–PAGE. The
rest of the reaction mixtures were then used for pull-down
assay with glutathione–Sepharose-bound puriﬁed GST-
Tip60 (100 ng protein in each reaction). Reactions were
performed in 10 vol of immunoprecipitation buﬀers
containing 50mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS and 1mM PMSF, for 4 h at 48C.
The agarose-gel was washed ﬁve times with the same
buﬀer, and HA-Sox9 proteins were released by boiling
with 2 SDS-sample buﬀer and fractionated by SDS–
PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-HA-antibody.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
An oligonucleotide probe of 48-bp enhancer, which bind
to the HMG box was made with complementary oli-
gonucleotides: 48 bp-1: 50-ggCTGTGAATCGGGCTCTG
TATGCGCTTGAGAAAAGCCCCATTCATGAGA-30
and 48 bp-2: 50-ggTCTCATGAATGGGGCTTTTCTC
AAGCGCATACAGAGCCCGATTCACAG-30. Upper
case sequence contains the nearly consensus binding site
for HMG protein including Sox9, and gg residues were
added at 50-end of each oligonucleotide for labeling with
32P-dCTP. Protein–DNA reactions were carried out as
previously described (40). Assays with recombinant
proteins and antibodies were carried out with 1 ng
of poly (dG–dC) and 20 mg of bovine serum albumin
(BSA).
Indirect immunofluorescence and fluorescence
deconvolution microscopy
COS7 cells transiently transfected with diﬀerent expres-
sion vectors and HCS-2/8 cells were ﬁrst ﬁxed with 4%
formaldehyde/PBS for 15min at room temperature. The
cells were then permeabilized with 20mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.6), 137mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) con-
taining 5% skimmed milk for 30min at room temperature,
and incubated with primary antibodies for 90min at 48C.
Anti-Sox9 rabbit antibody and anti-Tip60 goat antibody
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were diluted to 1:100. After
washing three times, the cells were incubated with
secondary antibodies and 40,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole
dihydrochloride (2 mg/ml). The dilutions of the secondary
antibodies were: Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-rabbit IgG,
1:5000; Alexa Fluor 555 donkey-anti-goat IgG, 1:5000
(Molecular Probes, OR, USA). GFP-tagged Tip60
was directly detected. Images were obtained with a
Zeiss Deconvolution Microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany).
Micromass culture
Micromass cultures were prepared as described in (41,42).
Brieﬂy, anterior and posterior limb buds of 11.5-day
mouse embryos (strain C57 black) were pooled and

digested by 2.5mg/ml trypsin at 48C for 3/4–1 h with
gentle shaking. The cells were dissociated by pipetting and
then centrifuged at 2000 r.p.m. for 5min. The pellet was
resuspended in culture medium F12 (Nissui, Tokyo,
Japan)/DMEM (Nissui), 1:1, with 10% FCS (GIBCO)
plus antibiotic/antimycotic (GIBCO, Pasuley, UK) at a
density of 1–2  107 cells/ml. A total 1  105 cells/10 ml of
cell suspension was placed in 24-well plate and placed in
5% CO2 at 378C for 1 h. After 1 h, 1ml of culture medium
containing 50 mg/ml of ascorbic acid was added to the
wells. Two hours later, the cells were treated with trans-
fection reagent with or without siRNAs and medium was
replaced every other day thereafter. Cell diﬀerentiation
was assessed by 0.1% alcian blue staining and immuno-
staining with anti-type II collagen antibody (Cosmo Bio,
#LB-1297) and detected with PicTure Kit (Zymed, CA,
USA). For analysis of gene expression level, the cultured
cells were collected and total RNA was prepared using
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). cDNA was prepared
using RNA-PCR kit (Takara, Japan) and PCR reaction
using SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo,
Japan) was monitored by LightCycler (Roche, Germany).

were embedded in paraﬃn and sectioned. Immunohisto-
chemical staining was done with the PicTure Kit (Zymed)
for anti-Sox9 rabbit IgG, and anti-Tip60 rabbit IgG
(Santa Cruz).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) asssays
The ChIP assayswere performed in HCS-2/8 cells and
synovial cells. Cross-linked and fragmentated lysates were
immunoprecipitated with control antibody, with anti-
Sox9, anti-Tip60 (goat, Santa Cruz) or anti-Sox5 anti-
bodies. PCR was performed to detect the coprecipitated
Col2a1 enhancer region with primer pairs: 50-cctcctctc

50-acgtagccatccaggctgtgctgtccc-30.
In vivo Sox9 acetylation assays
In vivo Sox9 acetylation assay was done basically
according to the previous report (43). Brieﬂy, COS7 cells
were transfected with a vector (pcDNA3.1) for expression
of Flag- and His-tagged wild-type and K61/253/398A
Sox9 with or without GFP-Tip60 18 h before subsequent
treatments. The cells were treated with 2 mM tricostatin A
(TSA) and 5mM nicotinamide (NA) for 6 h before
collection. The cells were lyzed in lysis buﬀer [10mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5M NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40,
10% glycerol] supplemented with a complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics), TSA and NA. The
whole-cell lysates were diluted with an equal volume of
incubation buﬀer [25mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5% Triton
X-100, 0.05% SDS] and incubated with Ni-agarose
(Qiagen) for 1 h at 48C with gentle mixing. After the
incubation, the resin was washed three times with wash
buﬀer [20mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 300mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1.5mM MgCl2 and 0.2% Nonidet P-40]. After
the ﬁnal wash, the resin was boiled in SDS-sample buﬀer
and the samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE with
subsequent western blotting using an antibody to acrtyl-
Lys (Upstate, NY, USA).
RESULTS
Identification of Tip60 as a Sox9 interactive molecule
Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for proteins that
directly interact with Sox9, we obtained several clones
from an HCS-2/8 human chondrosarcoma cDNA library
which encoded for Tip60. Tip60 exists in three isoforms:
isoform 1 (accession number: NP_874369) encodes addi-
tional 33 amino acids at N-terminus of isoform 2
(accession number: NP_006379), while isoform 3 (acces-
sion number: NP_874398) excludes 52 amino acids in the
N-terminal part. The Tip60 which we obtained included
amino acids 18–514 of isoform 2 and was either isoform 1
or 2. Tip60 is expressed relatively strongly in testis, heart,
brain, and weakly in kidney, liver and lung (44). To
conﬁrm direct interactions between Sox9 and Tip60,
we used several methods. First, to identify the Tip60
interaction sites in Sox9, full-length, N-terminal,
C-terminal and internal fragments of Sox9 were expressed
in AH109 yeast cells as GAL4-DNA-binding domain-
fusion proteins, whereas Tip60 was coexpressed as a
GAL4-transactivation domain-fusion protein (Figure 1A).
Interaction strength between Tip60 and Sox9 fragments
was estimated by measuring b-galactosidase activity
reﬂecting the activity of the reporter containing GAL4-
binding sites (Figure 1B). To measure the interaction
strength between Tip60 and either full length or truncated
forms of Sox9, b-galactosidase activity of the reporter
gene was measured, standardized to protein concentration
and corrected for the b-galactosidase activity obtained
after cotransformation of the pGADT7 empty vector with
the same series of Sox9 polypeptides. Binding to Tip60
was achieved by an almost full-length Sox9 fragment that
included residues 26–509, while the shorter fragments that
included amino acid residues between 409 and 509 such as
182–509, 298–509 or 409–509 also showed similar or even
higher eﬃciency. Other Sox9 truncated fragments lacking
residues 409–509 bound less eﬃciently, indicating that
Tip60 mainly interacts with the C-terminal transactivation
domain of Sox9, however, other Sox9 fragments such
as 26–189, which used for two-hybrid screening, or
26–304 also showed some binding activity to Tip60
(Figure 1B). In vitro coprecipitation assays using full-
length and truncated Sox9 fragments, which were
synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation and
recombinant GST-Tip60, which was immobilized on a

glutathione–Sepharose resin, largely conﬁrmed the yeast
two-hybrid assay results although they showed some
quantitative diﬀerences (Figure 2A). For instance, the
Sox9409–509 fragment did not show strong interactions
with Tip60 in the pull-down assay with GST-Tip60 beads,
whereas the yeast two-hybrid assay showed strong
interactions (Figure 2A). Overall, the results of the pull-
down assays suggested that the C-terminal transactivation
domain (Sox9409–509) of Sox9 is important for interaction
with Tip60 and that additional segments of Sox9 might
also contribute to binding (see Figure 1A). We also
examined the interactions between Sox9 and Tip60 by
coimmunoprecipitation of the proteins in transfected
COS7 cells. Figure 2B shows that Tip60 was immunopre-
cipitated with Sox9 antibody.
Sox9 contains a HMG-box domain that binds directly
to a speciﬁc sequence in the minor groove of DNA.
In EMSA experiments using a Col2a1 enhancer (48 bp)
probe that binds Sox9, the addition of recombinant Tip60
to recombinant Sox9 produced a slower-migrating DNA–
protein complex and increased the total amount of
complex formed (Figure 3, lane 4, asterisk). The presence
of both Sox9 and Tip60-His in the protein–DNA
complexes was veriﬁed by the addition of anti-Sox9
or anti-Tip60 antibodies. Anti-Sox9 antibody (Figure 3,
lane 5) and anti-Tip60 antibody (Figure 3, lane 6) gave rise
to supershifts.
Tip60 enhances Sox9-dependent transactivation of
a reporter containing multimerized enhancer sequences
of Col2a1 dose dependently
In cotransfection experiments of COS7 cells, Tip60
increased the activity of a Sox9-dependent Col2a1 reporter
construct 2.5 to 3 times (Figure 4A). The increase was

Figure 1. Tip60 associates with Sox9 in yeast cells. (A) Schematic diagram of Tip60 and Sox9 constructs. Tip60 contains a putative zinc ﬁnger
domain, a HAT domain and a nuclear hormone receptor (NR) box. Sox9 contains a dimerization domain, a high-mobility group DNA-binding
domain (HMG Box), a C-terminal transactivation domain (CT) and 4 ATG codons at the N-terminus portion in frame; the fourth ATG is suﬃcient
for transactivation of Col2a1 reporter in vivo and in vitro. (B) The ability of N-or C-terminally truncated Sox9 to associate with Tip60 in yeast was
quantiﬁed. All Sox9 fragments containing the CT domain associate with Tip60, while the N-terminal part including the HMG box binds only weakly.

dependent of Sox9 binding to DNA, since a mutant
Col2a1 reporter, (MA6)4x48p89/Luc construct, which
lacked Sox9 binding (45), did not show any transactiva-
tion in the presence of Sox9 and Tip60 (Figure 4A). The
Tip60-mediated increase in transactivation by Sox9 of the
Col2a1 reporter was also dose dependent (Figure 4B).
Subnuclear localization of Tip60 changes after binding Sox9
Because Tip60 is reported to act as a HAT, we evaluated
potential eﬀects of Tip60 on the subnuclear localization of
Sox9. In the chondrocyte cell line HCS-2/8 expressing
both endogenous Tip60 and Sox9, both proteins showed
colocalization in the nucleus in a diﬀuse pattern
(Figure 5A). Cos7 cells in which HA-tagged Sox9 was
overexpressed revealed a granular subnuclear localization,
whereas Cos7 cells expressing a green ﬂuorescent
protein (GFP)-Tip60 fusion polypeptide showed a punc-
tated subnuclear localization when each of these was
overexpressed separately (Figure 5B). When HA-Sox9 and
GFP-Tip60 were co-overexpressed in COS7 cells, Sox9
showed a slightly more diﬀuse localization, whereas
the Tip60 distribution changed from a punctuated to
a diﬀuse localization, largely overlapping with Sox9.
A proportion of Sox9 and Tip60 staining remained
separate (Figure 5B).
Tip60 modulates chondrogenesis during endochondral
ossification
During endochondral ossiﬁcation, Sox9 is expressed
speciﬁcally in resting and proliferative cartilage but not
in hypertrophic cartilage, whereas Tip60 is expressed
throughout the cartilage including hypertrophic cartilage
(Figure 6A). To examine the possible role of Tip60 in
chondrogenesis, we synthesized a siRNA speciﬁc for
Tip60 to downregulate Tip60 mRNA levels (see Materials
and methods section) and an inactive control siRNA.
The Tip60-siRNA partially downregulated Tip60 protein
expression at a concentration of 20 nM and 100 nM.
Control siRNA did not aﬀect Tip60 expression
(Figure 6B). The ability of Tip60 to interfere with
chondrogenic diﬀerentiation was then investigated in
micromass cultures of mesenchymal cells derived from
11.5-day embryonic mouse limbs (46–48). The mesench-
ymal cells started to develop alcian blue positive
cartilaginous nodules after 2 days of culture (Figure 6C).
The siRNA of Tip60 signiﬁcantly reduced the accumula-
tion of proteoglycans around cartilaginous nodules after
2 or 4 days in culture, whereas control siRNAs did not
decrease alcian blue staining. Accumulation of type II
collagen was also inhibited in Tip60 siRNA-treated
cultures after 4 days culture as shown by immunostaining
(Figure 6D). Gene expression of aggrecan and Col2a1 was
also downregulated in micromass cultures by Tip60
siRNA as measured by quantitative RT–PCR (Figure 6E).
Detection of Tip60–Sox9 interaction on Col2a1 enhancer
by ChIP
To further explore whether Tip60 associated with the
same chromatin segment of the Col2a1 enhancer element
of intron 1 which is the target of Sox9, we performed ChIP
experiments using HCS-2/8 cells which express both Sox9
and Tip60, As shown in Figure 7, anti-Tip60 precipitated
the same Col2a1 chromatin fragment in the Col2a1 intron
1 enhancer that was precipitated with the anti-Sox9
antibody; the coprecipitated Col2a1 fragment was identi-
ﬁed by PCR (Figure 7A, upper photo). Interestingly,
Sox5, which is known to bind to the same Col2a1
enhancer in EMSA assays, also interacted with this
segment in the ChIP assay (Figure 7A). In human synovial
cells, which express Tip60 but not Sox9, ChIP with anti
Tip60 did not indicate any precipitation of the Col2a1
enhancer, suggesting that recruitment of Tip60 to the
Col2a1 promoter requires Sox9. To conﬁrm the associa-
tion of Sox9, Tip60 and Sox5 with the Col2a1 enhancer,
ChIP analysis was also performed with primary mouse
chondrocytes. As in HCS-2/8cells, all three components
were found to associate with the Col2a1 enhancer, while

Figure 3. Tip60 binds to HMG sites of Col2a1 in the presence of Sox9
and stabilizes Sox9–DNA complex. An oligonucleotide probe covering
a 48-bp Sox9-dependent enhancer DNA segment of Col2a1 intron1 was
used for Sox9 binding by EMSA. His-tagged recombinant Sox9 and
Tip60 were puriﬁed from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses
expressing Sox9 and Tip60, respectively, using Ni–agarose. In the
presence of Tip60, the intensity of the Sox9–DNA complex increased
and migrated more slowly (lane 4). The existence of Sox9 and/or Tip60
in this slow-migrating complex was veriﬁed by adding speciﬁc
antibodies which caused a supershift (lanes 5 and 6). Asterisks indicate
the mobility of the major complexes in each lane.

Tip60 amplifies Sox9 transactivation enhanced by Sox5
in a naturalCol2a1 promoter
To test whether Tip60 might enhance the activity of
Col2a1 reporters, Tip60 was cotransfected with Sox9 in
the presence of Sox5. Tip60 stimulated 4-fold the activity
of a multimerized 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer linked to a
minimal Col2a1 promoter (Figure 8A). With a reporter
that contained a 3000 b promoter segment and 3020 b of
exon1 and intron1 of Col2a1, the Tip60 enhancement was
8-fold, suggesting that Tip60 may act on a transcriptional
complex containing both Sox9 and Sox5 also in the entire
Col2a1 gene (Figure 8B).
Since Tip60 slightly enhanced Sox5-induced transcrip-
tion of the 3-kb–3-kb Col2al promoter–enhancer con-
struct also in the absence of Sox9 (Figure 8B), the question
remained whether Tip60 can bind directly to Sox5. To test
this option, we carried out in vivo binding assay using
cell lysates containing ectopically expressed Flag-Sox5,
HA3-Sox9 and GFP-Tip60 (Figure 8C). The data show
that anti TIP60 did not coprecipitate Sox5 with Tip60
and/or Sox9, suggesting that Tip60 does not bind to Sox5,
but recruits Sox5 when binding to Sox9 in association with
the DNA in the Col2a1 enhancer.
Tip60 acetylates Sox9 through Lys61/253/398, but
enhancement of transcriptional activity of Sox9 by Tip60
is not affected by acetylation
Acetylation of lysine residues of transcription factors is
an important mechanism regulating their activity and
stability (43,49). Since Tip60 has been originally reported
as a HAT, we examined whether acetylation of Sox9 by
Tip60 aﬀects its transcriptional activity. For detection of
acetylated Sox9, we precipitated expressed Flag-Sox9-His
in Cos7 cells by Ni–agarose and subsequently analyzed the
acetylated protein by western blot using anti-acetyl-Lys
antibody. In the absence of Tip60, treatment with the
deacetylase inhibitors TSA and NA resulted in increased
amounts of acetylated Sox9 (Figure 9A). In the presence
of Tip60, acetylation of Sox9 was further increased and
stabilized, and the amount of acetylated Sox9 was
independent from the presence or absence of TSA and
NA (Figure 9A).
It has been reported that lysine residues which are
acetylated are also targets for SUMOylation (43). Since
Sox9 is SUMOylated through K61, K253 and K398 (36),
we examined whether K61/253/398A mutant is also
acetylated by TIP60. Interestingly, the K61/253/398A

mutant showed the same basal level of acetylation as wt
Sox9, however, Tip60 did not enhance acetylation of the
mutant, indicating that TIP60 acetylates the same lysine
residues which are SUMOylated. Treatment with TSA
and nicotinamide protected deacetylation of Sox9 even
in the presence of Tip60, suggesting that Sox9 may
contain acetylated lysine residues other than K61, K253
and K398.
Furthermore, the WT and K61/253/398A mutant of
Sox9 showed enhanced transcriptional activity of 4 48
Col2a1 promoter–reporter construct after coexpression of
Tip60 (Figure 9B), suggesting that the enhanced transcrip-
tional activation byTip60 is independent from Sox9
acetylation.
DISCUSSION
Sox9 has been shown to be a key factor for the initiation
of chondrogenesis and regulation of cartilage-speciﬁc gene
expression from early stages of chondrogenic diﬀerentia-
tion until onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy. To identify
Sox9 modulating proteins, we carried out a yeast

displayed a punctuated distribution in the nucleus (B), while Tip60 alone showed a somewhat patchy distribution in the nucleus (C), but the Tip60
distribution became more diﬀused in the presence of Sox9 (D); about 50% of the nuclear area shows codistribution of Sox9 and Tip60.

two-hybrid screen using a human chondrocyte cDNA
library. We previously identiﬁed in this screen proteins of
the PIAS family which act as SUMO ligases (36). Here, we
report on another protein identiﬁed in this screen, the
HAT Tip60 which interacts with Sox9 and enhances its
transcriptional activity.
Speciﬁc interactions between Sox9 and Tip60 reported
in this study were conﬁrmed by several assays. A yeast
two-hybrid assay using Sox9 deletions showed that the
C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of Sox9 is
the major Tip60-binding segment. The Tip60–Sox9 inter-
action was further supported by in vitro pull-down assays,
by coimmunoprecipitation of Sox9 and Tip60 after
cotransfection of COS7 cells, by their co-localization in
the nucleus of these cells as detected by immunoﬂuores-
cence, and by EMSA experiments demonstrating the
existence of a DNA–protein complex that contains both
Sox9 and Tip60. Immunoﬂuorescence analysis of trans-
fected HCS2/8 cells transiently expressing Tip60 showed
a punctuated subnuclear localization. When Tip60 was
co-overexpressed with Sox9, the distribution of Tip60
dramatically changed to a diﬀuse pattern. This phenom-
enon may be explained by a change in the Tip60 functions.
The majority of cellular Tip60 exists in a s\nuclear
multiprotein complex and is responsible for DNA
damage-related responses (28). In the nucleus of Sox9
co-expressing cells, Tip60 may be involved in transactiva-
tion of diﬀerent chromatin structures, thus assuming

a diﬀuse subnuclear localization. Also in our previous
study, activated Sox9 assumed a diﬀuse subnuclear
localization in the presence of Sox9-binding protein,
PIAS proteins and SUMO (36). These observations
support the notion that changes in the subnuclear
localization following activation of transcriptional factors
may be due to changes in the chromatin structure.
A ChIP experiment indicated that Tip60, Sox5 and
Sox9 interacted with the same Col2a1 chromatin DNA
fragment in chondrocytes; this segment contains a
chondrocyte-speciﬁc enhancer. Sox5 and Sox6, which are
coexpressed with Sox9 during chondrocyte diﬀerentiation,
share a high degree of sequence identity. They bind to
DNA as homo- or hetero-dimer but do not show a clearly
deﬁned transcriptional activation domain. Cotransfection
of Sox5 and Sox6 together with Sox9 enhances Sox9
stimulated expression of the endogenous Col2a1 and
aggrecan genes in chondrogenic mesenchymal cells,
suggesting that the three Sox proteins cooperate with
each other in the activation of downstream genes (7,21).
Because of their high degree of sequence identity it was
hypothesized that Sox5 and Sox6 would have overlapping
functions. Indeed, single-null Sox5 or single-null Sox6
mutant mice have a mild skeletal phenotype whereas the
double Sox5 and Sox6 mutants show practically no
cartilage and no overtly diﬀerentiated chondrocytes (23).
Because chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations do
form in the double mutants, it was concluded that Sox5
and Sox6 were required for overt diﬀerentiation of cells in
mesenchymal condensations (23).
In reporter gene experiments in cotransfected COS7
cells, Tip60 increased Sox9-dependent activation of
a Col2a1 reporter containing a multimerized short
chondrocyte-speciﬁc enhancer. This increased transactiva-
tion of Sox9 by Tip60 was further enhanced by coexpres-
sion of Sox5. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of
a reporter gene which includes a 3000 b promoter, ﬁrst
exon and 3020 b ﬁrst intron of Col2a1 was strongly
enhanced by Tip60 when transactivated by Sox9 and
Sox5. In vivo binding experiment of Tip60, Sox9 and Sox5
revealed that Tip60 binds directly to Sox9, but not to
Sox5. These results indicate that Tip60 may recruit Sox5
only in association with the Col2a1 enhancer, and
promotes the ability of Sox5 to enhance the trancriptional
activity of Sox9. In fact, ChIP assays indicated that Sox9,
Tip60 and Sox5 interacted with a Col2a1 intron 1 segment
containing a chondrocyte-speciﬁc enhancer, suggesting
that these interactions are physiologically signiﬁcant.
Synovial cells which do express Tip60, but not Sox9, did
not show interaction of Tip60 with the Col2a1 enhancer,
suggesting that the binding of Tip60 to Col2a1 enhancer is
accelerated by the presence of Sox9.
In the embryonic limb, Tip60 was detected in resting,
proliferative and maturing chondrocytes. SiRNA knock-
down of Tip60 mRNA resulted in delayed chondrogen-
esis, indicating that Tip60 is required for chondrocyte
diﬀerentiation through the regulation of Sox9 and Sox5
transcription activity. This is in line with a recent report
showing that Tip60 is expressed transiently during early
heart development (35), and conﬁrms the notion that
speciﬁc transactivations of target transcription factors by
Tip60 occur in developmental pathways.
Tip60 has been known as a histone acetylase (33). Here,
we report for the ﬁrst time that it may also play a role in
regulating transcriptional activity of Sox9. There is ample
evidence for transcription regulatory mechanisms by
acetylation; for example, acetylation of C-terminal reg-
ulatory domain of P53 by both p300/CBP and PCAF (2)
has been demonstrated to be critical for its regulation.
Thus, acetylation of Sox9 by Tip60 may well be important
for its transcriptional activity (50).
Previously, we have shown that in chondrocytes Sox9
lysine residues K61, 253 and 398 are SUMOylated by
families of PIAS (36). Here, we provide evidence that

Figure 9. (A) Enhanced acetylation of Sox9 but not the K61/253/398A
mutant by Tip60. COS7 Cells were transfected with 0.5 and 1 mg wild-
type (WT) or K61/253/398A mutant Flag-Sox9-His expression vector.
Sox9 from the cell lysates was precipitated with Ni–agarose, and the
acetylated Sox9 was analyzed by western blotting using anti-acetyl Lys
antibody. Total Sox9 in the same precipitates was detected by anti-Flag
antibody. Acetylation of Sox9 was enhanced by the addition of
deacetylation inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and nicotinamide (NA),
which were added to some samples 6 h before collection. Cotransfection
with a Tip60 expression vector (1mg) resulted in enhanced Sox9
acetylation in the presence of TSA and NA; the enhanced level of
acetylation was maintained in the absence of TSA and NA. Tip60 did
not enhance acetylation of the mutant Sox9 K61/253/398A, and the
acetylation level was not maintained in the absence of TSA and NA.
(B) Not only wt Sox9, also the K61/253/398A mutant exhibited
increased transcription activity of a luciferase reporter gene containing
a multimerized Col2a1 enhancer (4 48 Col2a1 p89) after cotransfec-
tion with Tip60. Cos7 cells were transfected with WT or K61/253/398A
mutant of Flag-Sox9-His (100 ng) and/or GFP-Tip60 (1 mg) expression
vectors with a 4 48 Col2a1 p89 luciferase reporter construct (0.77 mg)
and a SV40/b-galactosidase (3 ng) reporter construct as indicated.

Tip60 enhances acetylation of some or all of these lysine
residues since the Sox9 mutant K61/253/398A did not
show enhanced acetylation by Tip60. Surprisingly, how-
ever, Tip60 also enhanced transcriptional activity of the
Sox9 mutant K61/253/398A, suggesting that the observed
enhancement of transcription activity of Sox9 may involve
an additional mechanism, while the acetylation of Sox9 by
Tip60 may not play an exclusive role. Yet, the realization
that chondrogenic diﬀerentiation is governed by Tip60
HAT in connection with speciﬁc target transcription
factors suggests possible strategies for therapeutic manip-
ulating in development and disease.
