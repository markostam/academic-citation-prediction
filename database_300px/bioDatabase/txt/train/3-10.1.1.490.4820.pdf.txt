ABSTRACT
The Escherichia coli DNA mismatch repair (MMR)
protein MutS is essential for the correction of
DNA replication errors. In vitro, MutS exists in a
dimer/tetramer equilibrium that is converted into a
monomer/dimer equilibrium upon deletion of the
C-terminal 53 amino acids. In vivo and in vitro
data have shown that this C-terminal domain (CTD,
residues 801–853) is critical for tetramerization and
the function of MutS in MMR and anti-recombination.
We report the expression, purification and analysis
of the E.coli MutS-CTD. Secondary structure predic-
tion and circular dichroism suggest that the CTD
is folded, with an a-helical content of 30%. Based
on sedimentation equilibrium and velocity analyses,
MutS-CTD forms a tetramer of asymmetric shape. A
single point mutation (D835R) abolishes tetramer-
ization but not dimerization of both MutS-CTD and
full-length MutS. Interestingly, the in vivo and in
vitro MMR activity of MutSCF/D835R is diminished to a
similar extent as a truncated MutS variant (MutS800,
residues 1–800), which lacks the CTD. Moreover, the
dimer-forming MutSCF/D835R has comparable DNA
binding affinity with the tetramer-forming MutS, but
is impaired in mismatch-dependent activation of
MutH. Our data support the hypothesis that tetra-
merization of MutS is important but not essential for
MutS function in MMR.
INTRODUCTION
DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is critical for avoiding
mutations, anti-recombination and cell checkpoint activation
leading to apoptotic responses (1–3). In Escherichia coli,
MutS recognizes mismatches in DNA and subsequently
recruits MutL in an ATP-dependent manner. This ternary
complex activates downstream effector proteins such as the
strand-discrimination endonuclease MutH and UvrD helicase.
MutH nicks a hemimethylated GATC site in the unmethyl-
ated, erroneous strand followed by unwinding of this strand
by UvrD helicase and exonucleolytic digestion by one of sev-
eral exonucleases. Repair is completed by DNA polymerase
III holoenzyme and DNA Ligase I [reviewed in Ref. (2)].
The mismatch-recognizing MutS belongs to a family of
proteins whose members are found in organisms ranging
from bacteria to eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, several MutS
homologs exist that form heterodimers (e.g. MSH2-MSH6
and MSH2-MSH3), with no indication of higher oligomers
(2). Likewise, several heterodimeric MutL homologs have
been studied from both human (MLH1-PMS2) and yeast
(MLH1-PMS1) (3). In humans, mutations in the MMR genes
hMSH2, hMSH6 or hMLH1 cause predisposition to a com-
mon form of cancer called hereditary non-polyposis colorec-
tal cancer (HNPCC)/Lynch-syndrome (4).
The co-crystal structures of both E.coli and Thermus
aquaticus MutS bound to heteroduplex DNA have been
solved, using C-terminal truncated protein variants of
MutS (MutS800, residues 1–800 E.coli numbering) (5,6).
MutS800 crystallizes as a dimer, wherein only one monomer
has specific contacts to the mismatch and bound ADP. Using
analytical ultracentrifugation it was shown that in solution
MutS800 exists in monomer/dimer equilibrium while the
full-length MutS exist in a dimer/tetramer equilibrium (7,8).
The physiological effect of truncating MutS is controversially
reported in the literature, with data obtained using a multi-
copy plasmid resulting in either no effect or impaired MMR
function (6,9,10). Recently, E.coli with a truncated chromo-
somal mutS gene (mutSD800) was shown to exhibit a MutS
null phenotype for mutation avoidance, anti-recombination
and sensitivity to cytotoxic agents in a dam mutant (10,11).
However, the function of the tetrameric form still remains
unclear (12).
In vitro, MutS800 is impaired in DNA binding and
mismatch-provoked MutH activation (7). Deletion of a b slid-
ing clamp binding motif (812QMSLL816) of MutS abolishes
the interaction between MutS and b sliding clamp proteins
in vitro, although tetramerization and in vivo MMR activity
of MutS are unaffected (13). Since MutS800 lacks residues
involved in dimerization, tetramerization and binding to the
b sliding clamp, the primary cause of the observed defects

of MutS800 in MMR and anti-recombination remain to be
identified. Without structural data, the determinants of the
dimerization and tetramerization within the MutS-CTD are
unknown.
Here we describe the expression, purification and biophys-
ical characterization of the MutS-CTD (residues 801–853).
We demonstrate that a single point mutation (D835R)
in MutS-CTD has a strong effect on the tetramer/dimer
equilibrium, mimicking results observed for MutS800. In
addition, we analyzed the effect of this point mutation in
context of the full-length MutS and assayed MutSCF/D835R
for MMR, DNA binding and mismatch-provoked activation
of MutH. The implications of our results concerning the
function of the MutS tetramer are discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sequence analysis
To search for MutS homologs sequences five rounds of
PSI-BLAST were performed on the NCBI non-redundant
database (November 2005) using E.coli MutS as query
sequence (gi: 16130640). Sequences were then clustered
with CLANS (14), multiple alignments of the different
clusters performed with MUSCLE (15) and visualized with
BioEdit (16). Secondary structure prediction was performed
with the genesilico metaserver (17). Mutations in the human
MutS homologs were taken from the InSiGHT database
(http://www.insight-group.org/) (18) and the Human Gene
Mutation Database (19).
Strains, plasmids, enzymes and reagents
E.coli K12 strains CC106 (P90C [araD[lac-proXIII] [F’laciZ
proB+]) (20), TX2929 (CC106 mutS201::Tn5; Kmr) and
the pET-15b (Novagen) derived plasmids pTX412 and
pTX418 containing the mutS and mutL genes, respectively,
under control of the T7 promoter were kindly provided
by Dr M. Winkler (21). Plasmid pMQ402 (His6-MutH), a
pBAD18 derivative, was a kind gift of Dr M. Marinus (22).
For MutS and MutL protein expression E.coli strain
HMS174 (lDE3) (Novagen) and for MutH the E.coli strain
XL1 blue MRF0 were used (Stratagene).
Site-directed mutagenesis
pTX412/Cys-free containing the gene for a cysteine-free
MutS variant (referred to as MutSCF) was generated by repla-
cing all six codons of the native cysteine residues. The muta-
tions are, in order from the first cysteine in the sequence to
the last, C93A, C235S, C239A, C297S, C569S and C711V
with the numbering referring to the E.coli MutS sequence
(L. Manelyte and P. Friedhoff, manuscript in preparation).
Variants of MutS were generated with modifications of the
Quikchange protocol (Stratagene) as described previously
(23) using pTX412/Cys-free as a template and the respective
mutagenesis oligodeoxynucleotides: CTD 50-TTG CGT AGC
GGC GGC GTT CGG ATG GCT GCC GCG CG GCA CCA
G-30; MutS800 50-TAG CGG CCG CGT TCT ACG AAA
TGC TTT-30; MutSD835R 50-GGT GAG TGA TCT CGG
GTC CAG ATT TTC CA-30.
E.coli XL1-blue MRF0 were transformed with the full-
length PCR product. Marker positive clones were inoculated
in LB medium containing ampicillin for overnight growth.
Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep
(Qiagen) and the whole mutS gene sequenced.
Complementation mutator assay
Cells lacking a functional chromosomal mutS gene show a
mutator phenotype, which is analyzed by the frequency of
rifampicin-resistant clones arising from unrepaired poly-
merase errors in the rpoB gene (22). Single colonies of
mutS-deficient TX2929 cells transformed with vector control
or plasmids carrying the indicated gene were grown overnight
at 37C in 3 ml LB cultures containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin.
Aliquots of 50 ml from the undiluted or 106 diluted culture
were plated on LB agar containing 25 mg/ml ampicillin with
or without 100 mg/ml rifampicin. Colonies were counted after
overnight incubation at 37C.
Purification of proteins
Recombinant His6-tagged proteins were expressed and puri-
fied by Ni-NTA chromatography essentially as described
elsewhere (21,23,24). MutH was stored in 10 mM HEPES–
KOH (pH 7.9), 500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT
and 50% glycerol at 20C while MutL, MutS and MutS-
CTD proteins in 10 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.9), 200 mM
KCl and 1 mM EDTA (for MutS 10% glycerol was added)
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70C.
Protein concentrations were determined using the theoretical
extinction coefficients calculated from amino acid composi-
tion (25). In order to remove N-terminal His6-tag 10 mU/ml
diaminopeptidase DAPase (Qiagen) was incubated with
MutS-CTD in phosphate-buffered saline for 16 h at room
temperature. DAPase was removed following manufacture
protocol using Ni-NTA (Qiagen).
MutH endonuclease assay
MutH endonuclease was assayed on heteroduplex DNA sub-
strate (484 bp) containing a G/T mismatch at position 385 and
a single unmethylated GATC site at position 210 (26). DNA
(10 nM) was incubated with 200 nM MutH, 1 mM MutL
and 0, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 1 mM (monomer equivalents)
MutS in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
ATP, 50 mg/ml BSA and 125 mM KCl at 37C. MutH
endonuclease activity was scored by the appearance of
cleaved products (analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis).
Size-exclusion chromatography
MutS variants were analyzed by size-exclusion chromato-
graphy using a Sephadex 200 10/300 column. The column
was calibrated using the following standard proteins (Sigma):
thyroglobulin (MW ¼ 669 kDa, RS ¼ 8.5 nm), apoferritin
(443 kDa, 6.1 nm), b-amylase (200 kDa, 5.4 nm), alcohol
dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 4.5 nm), albumin (66 kDa,
3.55 nm), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, 2.35 nm), myoglobin
(16.9 kDa, 2.0 nm) and cytochrome c (12.5 kDa, 1.77 nm).
Samples (100 ml) containing different concentrations of
MutS full-length or CTD were injected into the column
equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 8.0), 500 mM
KCl, 1 mM EDTA, at flow rates of 0.5 ml/min. Elution
profiles were monitored at 280 nm.

Circular dichroism
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded in a Jasco
J-710 dichrograph between 185 and 280 nm at 20C in a
cylindrical cuvette of 0.05 cm path length. A baseline was
recorded and subtracted after each spectrum. Protein was
20 mM in 10 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA,
50 mM KCl. CDNN Deconvolution software (version 2;
Bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/cdnn) was employed
for estimation of secondary structure content.
DNA binding
DNA binding of MutS was determined by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA). The following oligodesoxynuc-
leotides were used: G-strand 50-TAT TAA TTT CGC GGG
CTC GAG AGC TTC ATC CTC TAC GCC GGA, T-strand
50-TCC GGC GTA GAG GAT GAA GCT TTC GAG CCC
GCG AAA TTA ATA and C-strand 50-TCC GGC GTA
GAG GAT GAA GCT CTC GAG CCC GCG AAA TTA
ATA. G-strand was labeled at 30 end using terminal desoxy-
nucleotidyl transferase (Fermentas) following the manufac-
turers instructions. G/T heteroduplex or G/C homoduplex
of 42 bp were prepared by annealing the G- with the T or
C-strand, respectively. MutS was incubated with 1 nM of
[32P]-labeled 42 bp G/T heteroduplex in binding buffer
[20 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.5), 125 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2,
50 mg/ml BSA and 0.5 mM ADP] in a total volume of 20 ml.
After 10 min at 37C 4 ml of 50% glycerol and 20 mM EDTA
solution was added, samples were placed on ice and loaded
under voltage onto 4% native polyacrylamide gels (29:1
acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 40 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mM
sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA. After electrophoresis at 4C
under 11.4 V/cm for 70 min, gels were analyzed using an
Instant-Imager (Packard). SigmaPlot was used to fit the data
to the following sigmoidal equation:
Y ¼ Y0 þ Y max S
n
Sn þ Kn ‚
where Y is the fraction of bound DNA, Y0 is the background
signal, Ymax is the maximum fraction of bound DNA, S is
the concentration of MutS in monomers, K is the apparent
dissociation constant and n is the Hill-coefficient.
Sedimentation equilibrium analysis
For determination of molecular masses in solution, sedimen-
tation equilibrium experiments in the analytical ultracentri-
fuge (Beckman-Coulter XL-A, UV absorption optics) were
exploited. Samples containing MutS-CTD at concentration
between 14 and 57 mM in 10 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.9),
250 mM KCl were run in two-channel centerpieces filled
with 150 ml sample and underlaid with 50 ml FC43 (ABCR,
Karlsruhe, Germany) as artificial bottom. Equilibrium runs
were performed at both 16 000 and 23 000 r.p.m. at 20C
for at least 32 h. Concentration profiles were measured
every hour and equilibrium attainment was assumed when
no change in these concentration profiles could be observed
over at least 12 h. Buffer absorption was determined after
sedimenting the protein for 7 h at 44 000 r.p.m. Apparent
molecular masses were calculated from traces averaged
over these last 12 h as described elsewhere (27).
Sedimentation velocity analysis
Determination of sedimentation coefficient s20,w were per-
formed at 20C in 10 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 mM
EDTA and 50 or 250 mM KCl at concentration between
30 and 50 mM of protein. Sedimentation profiles were mon-
itored at 280 nm. Sedimentation rate constants were obtained
by analyzing the movement of the sedimenting boundary or
by fitting a numerical solution of Lamm’s differential equa-
tion to the concentration profiles using the BPCFIT software
package (28).
RESULTS
Since deletion of the C-terminal 53 amino acid residues
(CTD) of MutS results in a truncated protein (MutS800) that
no longer forms tetramers in the concentration range studied
(7,8), we started to investigate the properties of the CTD in
more detail.
Secondary structure predictions
Our secondary structure prediction analysis of the CTD
region based on a multiple sequence alignment revealed a
bipartite organization of the CTD (Figure 1A). It consists
of a less conserved N-terminal region (residues 801–822)
with no predicted secondary structure which contains the b
sliding clamp binding motif (13) and a conserved C-terminal
region (residues 823–853) with a predicted helix–loop–helix
motif. Comparison of the MutS-CTD secondary structure pre-
diction from bacteria and eukarya revealed that all homologs
contain similar helical content (Figure 1B). Interestingly, sev-
eral cancer causing mutations are localized in the C-terminus
of the human MutS homologs, however, the biochemical
consequences of these mutations are still unknown (29).
Purification and secondary structure analysis of
the MutS-CTD
In order to analyze the structure and function of this domain,
we created a His6-tagged protein (MutS-CTD) corresponding
to residues 801–853 of the E.coli MutS. MutS-CTD was
expressed and purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA affinity
and size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 2A). Analysis
by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicated that
the N-terminal methione was missing resulting in a 71 residue
protein with a calculated mass of 7.7 kDa (Table 1). Upon
treatment with the diaminopeptidase DAPase, the N-terminal
His6-tag was removed to give MutS-CTD
DHis6 with a calcu-
lated mass of 6.4 kDa (Figure 2A).
Full-length MutS has been shown to form aggregates at
elevated concentrations especially in the absence of nucleo-
tide (30). In part the CTD was considered to be responsible
for this phenomenon since deletion of this domain allowed
crystallization of the protein (5,6). However, MutS-CTD
was soluble and homogeneous at concentrations up to
500 mM with no apparent formation of aggregates as judged
by size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentri-
fugation (see below). The CD spectra of MutS-CTD and
MutS-CTDDHis6 revealed that the protein adopts a folded
structure with 30% a-helical content (Figure 2B) consistent
with the secondary structure prediction (Figure 1A).

Quaternary structure analysis
Since the CTD had been shown to be essential for tetra-
merization of the full-length protein we asked whether the
domain on its own is sufficient to form tetramers. Sedimen-
tation equilibrium analysis indicates that MutS-CTD and
MutS-CTDDHis6 form tetramers (Figure 3 and Table 1).
Thus, tetramerization is a characteristic feature of this domain
and is not influenced by the N-terminal His6-tag. In the
concentration range tested (14–60 mM) we did not observe
any significant formation of either lower or higher molecular

weight species. Moreover, sedimentation velocity analysis
revealed sedimentation coefficients s20,w of 2.1 and 1.4 S for
MutS-CTD and MutS-CTDDHis6, respectively. Based on the
molecular mass and sedimentation coefficient obtained by
the sedimentation analysis, MutS-CTD is a tetramer with
highly asymmetric shape (Table 1).
Disruption of the tetramer by D835R mutation
In order to investigate the MutS-CTD in more detail we
generated several variants which we analyzed for their ability
to form tetramers (L. Manelyte, D. Goldeck and P. Friedhoff,
unpublished data). A single point mutant, MutS-CTDCF/D835R
abolished tetramerization while still preserving dimerization
(Figures 3 and 4 and Table 1). CD analysis of MutS-
CTDD835R indicates that the protein is very similar to MutS-
CTD with respect to secondary structure content. Therefore,
the amino acid exchange did not affect the overall structure
of the protein (Figure 2B). Sedimentation equilibrium and
velocity experiments revealed that the protein exists in solu-
tion as a dimer with asymmetric shape indicated by the fric-
tional ratio of 1.55. Our data imply that the CTD stabilizes
dimerization of the protein and allows tetramerization of
dimers. Since Asp-835 is located in the acidic loop of the
helix–loop–helix motif it is tempting to speculate that tetra-
merization is mediated via this loop.
Tetramerization of full-length MutS is important but
not essential for in vivo function in mismatch repair
As mentioned above the role of the MutS tetramer in vitro
and in vivo is controversially discussed in the literature.
This is in part owing to comparing the function of the
tetramer-forming full-length protein with a dimer-forming
truncated protein missing residues involved not only in tetra-
merization but also dimerization and probably interaction
with other proteins, e.g. the b sliding clamp (13). Con-
sequently, we asked whether the D835R mutation affects
the function of the full-length MutS protein. Starting from
an active cysteine-free MutS variant (MutSCF), we generated
a truncated MutS variant (MutS800CF) and the D835R variant
(MutSCF/D835R) which we assayed for MMR activity in vivo
(Table 2). MutSwt as well as MutSCF encoded on a multicopy
plasmid were able to complement the mutS-mutator pheno-
type resulting in low mutation frequencies on rifampicin/
ampicillin plates compared with the vector control. However,
both variant MutS800CF and MutSCF/D835R have impaired
MMR activity as indicated by elevated mutation frequencies,
5- to 10-fold higher compared with MutSwt and MutSCF,
respectively (Table 2).
Further, we purified the proteins and characterized
their biophysical and biochemical properties in vitro. Size-
exclusion chromatography experiments showed a concen-
tration dependence of elution profiles for both MutSwt and
MutSCF in agreement with the observed dimer/tetramer
equilibrium for MutSwt (8,31) (Figure 4, Table 3). In con-
trast to this, MutSCF/D835R did not show any concentration

dependence of the elution profiles. An apparent molecular
mass of 180 kDa was calculated based on gel-filtration
experiments suggesting that the protein exists as a dimer in
solution. This agrees with our sedimentation data for the
CTDD835R variant being a dimer in solution. Interestingly,
we observed concentration dependence in the elution profile
for the MutS-CTD which was diminished for MutS-
CTDD835R. Thus, we conclude that the D835R amino acid
exchange not only abolished tetramerization for the CTD
but also for the full-length protein. This enables us for the
first time to study a stable dimeric E.coli full-length MutS
protein for its function in DNA MMR.
Dimer-forming MutS binds to DNA with
similar affinity as tetramer-forming MutS
To test whether the reduced in vivo MMR activity of
MutSCF/D835R is owing to changed DNA-binding affinity,
we measured protein binding to 42 bp G/T heteroduplex
DNA using a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(Figure 5). MutSCF/D835R was able to bind to DNA with
similar affinity as MutSCF (Figure 5A) and MutSwt (data
not shown). However, we observed differences in the mobi-
lity of the protein–DNA complexes between MutSCF/D835R
and MutSCF. At low concentrations MutSCF/D835R forms a
fast migrating complex (C1) while MutSCF as well as MutSwt
(data not shown) form complexes with lower mobility
(C2, Figure 5A). At higher concentration we observe for
both proteins the formation of at least a second complex of
lower mobility (C2 and C3, respectively). MutSwt has been
reported to bind to short DNA oligonucleotides as a tetramer
(MutS4–DNA) (7). Hence, complex C2 observed for
tetramer-forming MutSCF might correspond with a MutS4–
DNA complex while complex C1 observed for dimer-
forming MutSCF/D835R to a MutS2–DNA complex.
Meanwhile complex C3 could correspond to any higher
order complex. In the absence of additional experiments,
however, these assignments must be regarded with caution.
The DNA binding data do not fit with a simple hyperbolic
function (Figure 5B), similar to previously reported (7,32).
We evaluated the titration curves with a cooperative binding
model yielding Hill-coefficients of 3.6 and 2, while the appar-
ent Kd-values of 42 ± 2 and 45 ± 3 nM for MutS
CF and
MutSCF/D835R, respectively, are virtual identical.

Dimer-forming MutS800 has been reported to be comprom-
ised in MutH activation in vitro. However, these results
were obtained with a truncated protein missing the CTD
that contains several conserved amino acid residues including
a b sliding clamp binding motif (7,13). Hence, we have
compared the biochemical activity of the dimer-forming
full-length MutSCF/D835R and truncated MutS800CF with the
tetramer-forming MutSwt and MutSCF in an assay that tests
for the initial step of methyl-directed MMR: the mismatch-
provoked activation of the MutH GATC endonuclease (33).
As reported for MutS800, activation of MutH endonuclease
is observed with both dimer-forming variants, however, the
level of activation was significantly lower even at elevated
MutS concentrations compared with the tetramer-forming
variants (Figure 6). Thus, our data support previous observa-
tions that the formation of a tetramer is important for the
in vivo as well in vitro function of the MutS protein.
DISCUSSION
This is the first report on the characterization of the MutS-
CTD and of a full-length dimer-forming MutS variant
(MutSCF/D835R). MutSCF/D835R shows similar properties as
MutS800 both in vivo and in vitro suggesting that the major
defects observed for the truncated MutS800 is owing to a lack
of tetramerization rather than to missing residues needed for
proper function. MutS-CTD can be expressed as a structured
soluble protein domain (Figure 2A) with good agreement
between predicted (Figure 1A) and experimentally deter-
mined secondary structure (Figure 2B). Furthermore, our
hydrodynamic analyses using size-exclusion chromatography
and analytical ultracentrifugation indicate that MutS-CTD

is sufficient for tetramerization (Figure 3 and 4). This corrob-
orates previous results showing that the tetramerization
domain of MutS resides within the last 53 amino acids. Sim-
ilar to full-length MutS, MutS-CTD exists in an equilibrium
mixture of dimers and tetramers (Figure 4). Notably, this
domain starts to dissociate into monomers at concentrations
<200 nM, however, we did not attempt to determine any
dissociation constants based on the size-exclusion chromato-
graphy data. It has been reported elsewhere that the truncated
MutS protein (MutS800) exists as an equilibrium mixture of
monomer and dimers that is shifted towards the dimeric form
upon nucleotide binding (8). This raises the question whether
the observed MMR defect of the MutS800 is owing to a
changed monomer/dimer or dimer/tetramer equilibrium.
Moreover, deletion of the CTD also removes the ß sliding
clamp interaction motif (residues 812–816) although a recent
report suggest that deletion of these residues had no effect on
either in vivo MMR function or oligomerization in vitro (13).
An important step towards elucidating the function of the
CTD and the MutS-tetramer was the generation of a single-
point mutant (D835R) that abolishes tetramerization while
preserving dimerization of the MutS full-length protein.
MutSCF/D835R has a mutator phenotype in vivo similar to
the truncated MutS800CF variant (Table 2). DNA binding
analysis of MutSCF/D835R and MutSCF clearly demonstrated
that both proteins bind to a 42 bp G/T mismatch containing
DNA with similar apparent affinities, but qualitatively formed
complexes with different electrophoretic mobility (Figure 5).
Interestingly, a single hyperbolic function (single binding site
mode) did not fit to the data. Proper fitting was obtained using
a sigmoidal binding function with Hill coefficient of (n ¼
2 and 3.6, respectively). It has been previously reported
that a simple hyperbolic function (single site binding mode)
is insufficient to describe the DNA binding of MutS (7,32).
The concentration dependencies of the tetramer-forming
MutSCF and dimer-forming MutSCF/D835R support the idea
that a more complex binding model is highly probable. Fur-
ther studies will be required to establish a proper model for
the DNA–MutS interaction that must take into account the
dimer/tetramer equilibrium of MutS. Our data agree with sur-
face plasmon resonance spectroscopy results, which showed
DNA binding of a MutSwt tetramer and a MutS800 dimer,
respectively (7). We observed significant differences between

the tetramer-forming and the dimer-forming MutS variants
in their ability to promote mismatch-provoked activation
of MutH (Figure 6). Both, MutS800CF and MutSCF/D835R
are impaired in this reaction, which corroborates previous
experiments with MutSwt and MutS800 (7).
Our data support a functional role for a tetramer in DNA
MMR. In contrast to previous studies we investigated func-
tional differences between dimer- and tetramer-forming
MutS variants in the context of the full-length rather than
truncated proteins. In many models presented for coupling
mismatch recognition by MutS and downstream processes
such as strand discrimination by MutH [reviewed in
Ref. (2)] only the dimeric form of MutS is discussed.
Available experimental evidence including our data presented
here strongly suggest that a MutS tetramer should be con-
sidered as an active form of MutS which might be important
for MutS-induced DNA looping (2). However, since the
dimer-forming MutS variant has substantial activity in vitro
and in vivo more experiments are warranted that aim to
describe mechanistic differences between tetrameric and
dimeric MutS. This helps to explain controversial data
obtained in assays for mismatch-provoked MutH activation
observed under various experimental conditions (2).
Although initial studies on the MutS from T.aquaticus
suggested that the protein is predominantly a dimer in solu-
tion at concentrations <10 mM even in the presence of the
CTD (34), recent data suggest that Taq-MutS can bind to
DNA as dimers and tetramers at concentrations between
10 and 20 nM with only one dimer in the tetramer being in

contact with the DNA (35). Gel mobility shift experiments
using the yeast MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer suggest that an
additional MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer binds to the MSH2-
MSH6-DNA complex probably via protein–protein interac-
tions (36) thus forming a tetramer on the DNA. However,
at present, there is no evidence for heterotetramers in euka-
ryotic MutS homologs suggesting that a dimeric form of
MutS might be sufficient for efficient repair. This is in line
with recent findings that in vivo MMR in E.coli depends on
the expression level of MutS800 (10). While MMR function
is recovered due to increased expression of dimer-forming
MutS800 this is not the case for the anti-recombination
function (10). It will therefore be interesting to determine
whether the dimer-forming full-length MutSCF/D835R is
impaired in anti-recombination, thus clarifying the import-
ance of the CTD for this particular function of MutS.
