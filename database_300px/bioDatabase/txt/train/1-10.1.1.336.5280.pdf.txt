Abstract
HAMBLY, C. AND J.R. SPEAKMAN. Contribution of
different mechanisms to compensation for energy restriction
in the mouse. Obes Res. 2005;13:1548–1557.
Objective: Restriction of energy intake produces weight
loss, but the rate of loss is seldom sustained. This is pre-
sumed to be a consequence of compensatory reductions in
energy expenditure, although the exact contributions of
different components to the energy budget remain uncer-
tain. We examined the compensatory responses of mice to a
20% dietary restriction.
Research Methods and Procedures: We measured body
mass, body fatness, body temperature, and the components
of daily energy expenditure for 50 MF1 mice. Forty mice
were then placed on a restricted diet at 80% of their ad
libitum intake for 50 days. The remaining 10 mice contin-
ued to feed ad libitum. Ten days before the end of the
restriction period, the same measurements were taken.
Results: There were no significant differences between the
control and restricted groups in any parameters before re-
striction. During the restriction period, body mass increased
in both the control and restricted groups, but at a slower rate
in the restricted mice. The control group increased in both
fat and fat free mass; however, although the restricted group
increased fat to the same extent as the controls, fat free mass
increased to a lesser extent. The contributions of the differ-
ent components of the expended energy to compensate for
the reduced energy intake were energy deposition, 2.2%;
resting metabolic rate, 22.3%; and activity, 75.5%.
Discussion: Mice were able to compensate almost com-
pletely for the restricted energy intake that was achieved by
altering the amount of energy required for each component
of the energy budget except digestive efficiency.
Key words: dietary restriction, energy expenditure,
body composition, resting metabolic rate
Introduction
If an animal is in energy balance, its body mass and body
composition generally remain stable. Although animals can
adjust for subtle alterations in energy budget over the short
term, prolonged imbalances can cause weight gain or loss.
Dietary restriction has been advocated as a treatment for
obesity for over 2500 years (Hippocrates, 5th century B.C.).
Yet, despite the fact that caloric restriction is the oldest,
most frequently prescribed and self-prescribed treatment for
overweight and obesity, the strategy is seldom successful.
Rates of weight loss under restriction are rarely sustained
for any protracted period. Moreover, the lost weight is
frequently regained when the period of restriction ends
(1,2).
A major factor involved in the failure of caloric restric-
tion is the compensation in energy balance that offsets
caloric deficits. These changes retard the reduction in
weight loss and potentially promote weight gain if their
action is prolonged into the period after termination of
restriction (3). Understanding and quantifying the contribu-
tions of different mechanisms to the phenomenon of com-
pensation are, therefore, of critical importance in under-
standing the reasons that caloric restriction generally does
not work and in designing strategies that might overcome
this problem.
There are three potential mechanisms that might be em-
ployed to compensate for reduced caloric intake. Animals
may increase their digestive efficiency to extract more en-

ergy from the ingested food. They may reduce their rates of
resting energy expenditure, and they may reduce their en-
ergy expended on activity. The contribution of these differ-
ent mechanisms has been an issue of considerable debate.
Unfortunately, reporting of compensatory mechanisms dur-
ing caloric restriction is often confused by the method of
expressing the energy expenditure as a function of body
mass. Energy expended can be expressed relative to
body weight, fat free mass (FFM),1 metabolic size, or body
surface area, or adjusted using analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA).
Another important factor introducing variation into pre-
vious reports is that there may be two phases in the re-
sponses to caloric restriction, an adaptive phase when en-
ergetic parameters are adjusting to compensate for the
reduced energy availability and a period after energy bal-
ance has been reestablished and compensation is, therefore,
complete. Studies that examined only the adaptive phase did
show a decline in oxygen consumption (VO2) (4,5). Wein-
sier et al. (6) observed that resting metabolic rate (RMR)
declined during energy restriction in humans but quickly
returned to the prerestricted value when energy balance was
reached at the lower caloric intake (6). Again, however,
there is confounding evidence, with rats restricted by either
25% or 50% and then held in energy balance at a lower
caloric intake still showing a significantly reduced RMR
expressed relative to metabolic weight compared with con-
trols (7). Age may also be a factor that influences the
response, with no differences in total or basal energy ex-
penditure being seen with 60% restriction until rats reached
24 months of age (8). In addition, the time of measurement
may also contribute to the variations observed. Daytime and
afternoon energy expenditure did not differ significantly in
rhesus monkeys with a 30% reduction in food intake, but
night time energy expenditure was significantly reduced (9).
Several studies have observed that body temperature de-
clines in calorie-restricted rodents (10,11) and rhesus mon-
keys (12), which would reduce thermoregulatory costs.
Moreover, activity may also decline, although again the data
are confused. Leibel et al. (13) found that the amount of
time spent being active did not change, although many
studies have observed that when provided with a wheel, the
response of rodents to caloric restriction is to increase
activity (14–16), presumably a response to find additional
food, despite the fact that this increased activity drives the
animals into greater energy deficit. These effects would all
help to conserve energy and return the animal back into
energy balance. A final contributory factor to the observed
variability in responses of animals to caloric restriction is
that the mechanisms of compensation have been found to
vary with the severity of the restriction (7,17,18).
The overall aim when obese humans are placed on caloric
restriction is to reduce their body fat content. Normally,
however, fat cannot be lost alone. During weight loss
amounting to a 10% decrease in body mass, 25% of the
weight loss has been shown to be due to FFM decreases in
humans (19). The proportion of mass lost from different
sources may depend strongly on their initial proportions
within the body or on genetic makeup; for example, differ-
ences in the amount of fat tissue reflect the main difference
in body mass in a non-genetic model of dietary-resistant and
dietary-induced obese Sprague-Dawley rats (20). When
these animals were given an extreme restriction of 50% of
ad libitum food intake, both phenotypes lost similar propor-
tions of weight, but only the dietary-induced obese rats
reduced their fat pad weight, whereas dietary-resistant rats
lost primarily FFM (21). In contrast, Zucker (fa/fa) rats, a
genetic model for obesity, actively defend the proportion of
fat in relation to body mass when restricted by 35% (22),
whereas liver and kidney mass is reduced.
In the present study, we aimed to examine the complete
energy intake and expenditure in MF1 mice before and after
a dietary restriction of 20% of ad libitum intake for 50 days.
We aimed to determine whether compensatory mechanisms
were adopted to prevent continued weight reduction and, if
they were present, the relative contributions of different
mechanisms. We also examined parallel changes in the
masses of the fat and FFM depots.
Research Methods and Procedures
Fifty 10-week old male MF1 mice were used in this
study. The MF1 strain was generated in 1970. It is an
outbred strain resulting from a cross of LACA and CS1
mice and has been maintained as a closed colony by Harlan
(Oxon, United Kingdom). They were housed individually in
M3 cages (48  15  13 cm) (NKP, Kent, United King-
dom) at 20  2 °C under a 12-h-light/12-h-dark photope-
riod with lights on at 7 AM. All mice had ad libitum access
to water throughout the study and were provided with wood
shavings, shredded paper bedding, and plastic mouse houses
for enrichment. The diet used in this study was pelleted rat
and mouse breeder and grower diet (Special Diets Services,
BP Nutrition, Essex, United Kingdom). This diet had a
gross energy (GE) content of 17.4 MJ/kg (9.2% fat by
energy, Table 1) (23).
After a 10-day acclimation period, a series of measure-
ments were taken. Body mass and ad libitum food intake
were recorded over 10 days. Body temperature was mea-
sured using a rectal probe (model 2751-K and K-type ther-
mocouple; Digitron Instrumentation Ltd., Hertfordshire,
United Kingdom) daily for 4 consecutive days between 4
and 6 PM because continuous measurements with implanted
telemetry devices have indicated that this period includes

the minimum temperature in the daily cycle (J.R. Speak-
man, T. Eadie, P. Redmand, and E. Krol, unpublished data).
Body composition (fat and FFM) was determined using
DXA (Lunar PIXImus, GE Medical Systems, Madison,
WI). For this latter measurement, animals were anesthetized
for 3 minutes during the reading using a halothane and
oxygen mix. The size of measurement area was restricted,
and the requirement of a mask to administer the anesthetic
meant that the head region had to be excluded from the
analysis. This is a standardized technique, and the measured
fat mass (FM) was corrected using the appropriate equation
for our machine. The equation was generated after scanning
a range of obese and wild-type small rodents (excluding the
head region) and then performing chemical extraction to
accurately compare the DXA FM prediction to the actual
value. The machine is accurate to 0.02 grams at predicting
FM using this equation (24).
Energy Expenditure
Energy expenditure was divided into several components
that were separately quantified. These included RMR, en-
ergy content of the diet and feces, and fecal production.
Activity levels were calculated as the deficit between en-
ergy digested and the combination of energy required to
accumulate FM, FFM, and RMR.
RMR was measured either in the morning or afternoon at
thermoneutral temperatures over a 3-hour period by placing
each individual unrestricted into a large Plexiglas cylindri-
cal chamber (35 cm long, 9 cm in diameter) in an indirect
calorimetry system. Air was pumped through the system at
a constant rate (600–800 mL/min), and VO2 and carbon
dioxide production (VCO2) were averaged for each 30-sec-
ond period on a dual channel gas analyser (Xentra 1400;
Servomex, East Sussex, United Kingdom).
Dietary efficiency of each animal was examined by cal-
culating the GE content of the diet and fecal deposits. To
achieve this, each animal was provided with a clean cage
and reduced bedding of wood shavings and shredded paper.
Ninety-six hours later, these cages were removed, and new
cages were provided. The feces collected over the 96-hour
measurement period were carefully separated from the
wood shavings, weighed (Ohaus analytical balance,
0.0001; Ohaus Corp., Pine Brook, NJ), and dried in an
oven (Gallenkamp, Loughborough, United Kingdom) along
with the food sample at 60 °C until weight stable. This
enabled the percentage of water in the diets and feces to be
calculated before analysis by Adiabatic Bomb Calorimetry
(Gallenkamp). Apparent energy absorption efficiency
(AEAE) was calculated using the following equation:
AEAE (%)
[Dry food intake (g) GE food]
[Dry Feces (g) GE Feces]
(Dry food intake GE food)
Remaining samples were then pooled in groups of 10 for
analysis of nitrogen, protein, carbohydrate, fat, and ash
content.
Dietary Manipulation
Forty mice were placed in a restricted group, whereas 10
remained feeding ad libitum. The average daily food intake
was calculated for each individual in the restricted group,
and 80% of this was provided on a daily basis for the
following 50 days. Food rations were provided in one meal,
which always occurred at the same time during the light
cycle (at 12 PM). Body mass was measured twice weekly
during the restricted period, and food intake was measured
once a week in the control animals and divided to produce
a daily estimate. Ten days before the end of the restriction,
each animal had the same measurements taken as previously
described. RMR was again measured in the morning
(prefeeding) and afternoon (postfeeding), which gave an
indication of the impact of diet-induced heat loss on energy
expenditure.
Data Analysis
Minitab version 14 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA) was
used for analysis. Paired Student’s t tests compared differ-
ences between measurement periods within groups, whereas
one-way ANOVA and generalized linear models (GLM)
tests were used to compare differences between groups.
Means are shown  SE, and differences were considered
significant when p  0.05.
Results
Before diet manipulation, there were no differences in
any of the parameters between the control and restricted
groups (one-way ANOVA, p  0.05). Table 2 shows the
means for each of the parameters measured before and
during restriction.

Body Composition
Body mass rose significantly by 4.6 grams during the
intervention period in the control animals from an average
of 36.2 1.14 to 40.8 1.18 grams (paired Student’s t test,
T  11.93, p  0.001). Although the restricted animals
were on a 20% dietary restriction, their body masses also
rose significantly, but to a lesser extent, by 2.7 grams from
35.7  0.36 grams before restriction to 38.4  0.53 grams
at the end of restriction (paired Student’s t test, T  8.04,
p  0.001). The rate of body mass increase averaged over
the restriction period was, therefore, lower in the restricted
mice, at 0.05 g/d compared with 0.09 g/d in the controls.
Although the rate of weight gain was lower, by the final
measurement period (days 36 through 47 of restriction),
average body mass in the restricted animals was not signif-
icantly different from that of the controls [ANOVA,
F(1,49)  3.79, p  0.057] (Figure 1). At this stage, there
was also no significant difference in the amount of fat tissue
between the restricted and control mice (Table 2) [GLM
treatment effect using a body mass covariate, F(1,49) 
1.08, p  0.30]. Both control and restricted mice had
significantly increased the amount of fat tissue from the
initial measurement phase (paired Student’s t test, controls,
T  6.64, p  0.001; restricted, p  8.91, p  0.001). In
contrast, the control animals had 6.3% more FFM than the
restricted mice during the restriction phase, which ac-
counted for the slight difference in body mass [GLM treat-
ment effect using a body mass covariate, F(1,49)  20.98,

p  0.001]; however, as with fat tissue, both groups had
increased their FFM from the initial value (paired Student’s
t test, controls, T  9.21, p  0.001; restricted, T  3.26,
p  0.002).
Energy Intake
The dry food intake of the control animals remained
constant throughout the study (difference between measure-
ments 1 and 2, paired Student’s t test, T  1.01, p  0.34)
(Figure 2) and averaged 85.8  1.48 kJ/d (paired Student’s
t test, T 0.99, p 0.35). The intake of the restricted group
was controlled at an average of 69.3 kJ/d during restriction,
which was significantly lower than the prerestriction intake
of the same animals (paired Student’s t test, T  51.8, p 
0.001). Because the amount of food consumed in the control
mice did not change, they also did not differ in the amounts
of each diet constituent (nitrogen, protein, carbohydrates,
and fats) that they consumed over the measurement period
(paired Student’s t test, p  0.05; Table 3). Restricted mice
did show a reduction in the amount of each dietary constit-
uent consumed each day, according to their proportions in
the diet, by an average of 0.03  0.0006 grams (nitrogen),
0.2  0.004 grams (protein), 0.67  0.01 grams (carbohy-
drates), and 0.043  0.001 grams (fats).
Not all energy intake is available for mobilization be-
cause some is not absorbed, and other energy is excreted.
One compensatory mechanism available to animals under
restriction is to increase the digestive efficiency, thus mak-
ing more of the ingested energy available for use. The
control animals did not reduce their fecal production be-
tween the two measurement periods (paired Student’s t test,
T  0.24, p  0.82) and also showed no difference in the
levels of the constituents found in the feces. The energy
content of the feces, however, was significantly increased
over the duration of the experiment in the controls by 2.6%
(paired Student’s t test, T 4.95, p 0.001). Thus, controls
were becoming slightly less efficient at digesting their food.
During restriction, the fecal production of the restricted
animals was reduced by an average of 10% from that
measured before restriction (paired Student’s t test, T 
4.87, p  0.001). There was a consequent significant re-
duction in the amount of each constituent (nitrogen, protein,
carbohydrates, and fats) found in the restricted mice’s feces
(Table 3). Taking into account the changes in the amounts
of the different constituents that had been consumed or
eliminated, the digestive efficiency remained unchanged
during restriction. Consequently, the intakes of the constit-
uent components of the food were all reduced by similar
amounts to the total intake, between 20% and 22% (paired
Student’s t test, p  0.05). In the restricted animals, the
energy content of the feces was reduced by 1.7% during
restriction (paired Student’s t test, T  4.1, p  0.001);
therefore, restricted mice became slightly more efficient at
retaining the energy available from the food than the con-
trols.
We assumed that 3% of the available energy would be
lost in urine (25). Combined with the digestive efficiency
measured above, this meant that 79.1% and 78.7% of the
ingested food was available for mobilization in the control
and restricted animals, respectively. When the digestive
efficiency was applied to the energy intake, the amount of
metabolizable energy available to the animals was 68.1 
1.40 kJ/d, for the control animals and 53.04  1.17 kJ/d in
the restricted animals, which was significantly reduced rel-
ative to the prerestriction value (paired Student’s t test, T 
27.93, p  0.001).
Energy Expenditure
Control mice increased their VO2 by 8% and VCO2 by 11%
over the two measurement periods (Table 2), which was
significant for CO2 and approached significance for O2
(paired Student’s t test, VO2, T  2.10, p  0.07; VCO2, T 
2.36, p  0.046). The increase was directly related to the
simultaneous increase in body mass [GLM treatment effect

using a body mass covariate, VO2, F(1,18) 0.13, p 0.73;
VCO2, F(1,18)  0.10, p  0.75]. The respiratory quotient
(RQ) in the controls remained unchanged at 0.8 over the
two measurement periods (paired Student’s t test, T  0.62,
p  0.55). The restricted animals, however, increased VCO2
by only 5%, and their VO2 decreased by 1%, neither of
which was significantly different from the prerestriction
measurement (paired Student’s t test, VO2, T  0.52, p 
0.61; VCO2, T  1.31, p  0.20). When alterations in body
mass were taken into account, VCO2 was not significantly
different from the prerestriction measurement, whereas VO2
was significantly lower by 0.05 mL/min for a given body
mass [GLM treatment effect using a body mass covariate,
VO2, F(1,78)  4.92, p  0.03; VCO2, F(1,78)  0.13, p 
0.73]. Unlike body mass, FFM accounted for the lack of
change in VO2 during restriction [GLM, treatment effect
using FFM as a covariate, F(1,78)  1.57, p  0.22). The
RQ was higher in the restricted animals from that measured
before treatment, at 0.84 compared with 0.79. Daily RMR,
calculated using the Wier equation (26), was 27.82  2.04
kJ/d for controls and 24.81  0.77 kJ/d for restricted mice.
Absolute RMR was significantly lower in the restricted
mice [one-way ANOVA, F(1,47) 0.50, p 0.03], but the
difference observed was not significant when either body
mass (BM) or FFM was taken into account [GLM, treatment
affect using BM as a covariate, F(1,47)  0.86, p  0.36,
or FFM as a covariate, F(1,47)  0.33, p  0.57]. There
was also no significant difference depending on whether the
measurements occurred prefeeding or postfeeding in the
restricted group [one-way ANOVA, F(1,38)  0.18, p 
0.68], indicating that diet-induced thermogenesis did not
play a large role in the energy expenditure of these rodents.
The mass change of fat and FFM was calculated in grams
per day over the 50-day restriction period for both the
control and restricted mice using the data derived from body
composition estimates using DXA. An estimate for fat and
FFM change for the prerestriction period was based on the
weight gain over the 2-week measurement period that was
partitioned into fat and FFM gain using ratios obtained from
the control mice. The amount of energy, therefore, required
for these fat and FFM changes was calculated using values
from Livesey and Elia (27) (Table 2). During restriction,
mice expended 15.5% less energy on tissue deposition than
controls (from 1.94 to 1.64 kJ/d). Activity energy expendi-
ture was calculated as the deficit between energy digested
and the combination of energy required for the accumula-
tion of FM, FFM, and RMR. There was no significant
difference in activity levels between the restricted and con-
trol mice before restriction [one-way ANOVA, F(1,49) 
0.04, p  0.84]. During the restriction, the energy spent on
activity was 27.5% lower in the restricted mice [one-way
ANOVA, F(1,47) 16.20; p 0.001] (from 36.98 to 26.80
kJ/d).
There was no significant difference in body temperature
in the control group over the two measurement periods
(paired Student’s t test, T  1.82, p  0.10); however, the
restricted animals significantly increased their average body
temperature from 36.3  0.05 °C to 37.0  0.07 °C (paired
Student’s t test, T  9.12, p  0.001).
Energy Balance
Mice remained in positive energy balance as BM contin-
ued to increase, although energy intake was 20% lower in
the restricted mice. The digestive efficiency was virtually
the same when comparing controls and restricted animals;
therefore, the energy available for mobilization was also
20% lower. The difference between the amount of energy
that the controls and restricted mice diverted to gain body
mass was 0.30 kJ/d. Had the restricted mice not lowered
their activity and RMR levels with the restriction in energy
intake, there would have been a deficit in energy available
of 11.8 kJ/d. This would have generated a weight loss of
0.3 grams of fat per day. The relative contributions to the
energy expenditures of the control and restricted animals are
illustrated in Figure 3. Mice compensated for the reduced
energy availability by reducing energy devoted to tissue
deposition by 15.46% (from 1.94 to 1.64 kJ/d), RMR by
10.82% (from 27.82 to 24.81 kJ/d), and activity by 27.53%

account for the compensated energy expenditure during
restriction were: tissue deposition, 2.22%; RMR, 22.31%;

Discussion
We have shown that mice were able to recruit several
compensatory mechanisms to prevent weight loss during the
reduction in dietary intake of 20% by adjusting their energy
expenditure. It seemed that the compensation was rapid
because there was a lag of only 15 days before their rate of
weight gain approached that of the controls. Similar to our
results, Gursoy et al. (28) found that providing 70% of the
initial dietary intake in rats did not lead to any weight loss;
however, the weight gain of restricted animals was only
30% of the unrestricted animals, at a much slower and fairly
consistent rate of increase. The energy deficit was, there-
fore, almost completely compensated for. It appears that
there is a critical extent of restriction that can be compen-
sated for. Hill et al. (7) examined the responses to two
different levels of caloric restriction in rats, 25% and 50%.
The 25% restriction group only temporarily lost weight
before compensatory mechanisms allowed their body mass
to increase again, whereas the 50% group was unable to
fully compensate and continued to lose body mass. The
extent of compensation was greater in the more severely
restricted group but was unable to meet the maintenance
requirements. The 25% restriction group also mirrored the
current study by increasing both fat and FFM, and fat also
appeared to be increased by a greater proportion (7). The
same was true for rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) (29)
restricted by 30% for 5 years. In these animals, digestive
efficiency did not differ with restriction; however, FFM
showed significant reductions compared with controls,
whereas FM remained comparable.
Declines in certain organs may contribute to the reduction
or, in our case, maintenance of FFM. Gursoy et al. (28)
found that organs such as the heart and kidney did not show
any change, whereas the thymus and liver reduced in mass,
and the testis and adrenals increased in mass. Greenberg and
Boozer (30) found that the brain was unaffected, but that the
heart and kidneys were slightly but significantly lighter, and
the liver was reduced to almost one-half the weight of the
unrestricted controls after 18 months of 40% restriction.
With less food entering the digestive system, the mass of
organs with specific functions to deal with food can be
reduced without altering their ability to process the diet. A
previous study on this sex and strain of mouse found that the
total mass of the digestive organs was significantly lower
during 20% dietary restriction in relation to body mass (C.
Hambly, unpublished data). This remodeling process for the
digestive tissues can be extremely rapid, as observed with
migrating birds (31). They require a large digestive system
to rapidly gain mass before a long migratory flight but then
need to reduce their weight before flight so that they do not
waste energy carrying unnecessary weight. The digestive
system, consequently, is drastically (61%) and rapidly
(within 2 days) reduced before migrational departure (32).
Similar rapid changes in organ mass have been observed in
response to dietary restriction; for example, rats that had
been fasted for 65 hours regained their liver weight after
only 2 days on refeeding, whereas it took 9 days to regain
adipose tissue (33).
Why these mice under restriction choose to protect their
fat stores at the expense of FFM is probably related to the
differential energy expenditure of the fat and lean tissues.
By reducing lean tissues, animals can reduce their RMRs
(see below) and, thereby, narrow the gap between intake
and expenditure. Mobilizing fat, in contrast, would provide
energy to fill the deficit for a short period but would not
provide a longer term solution. There is evidence for small
mammals that fat stores are regulated in a dynamic trade-off
between the risks of predation and the risks of starvation
(for review, see 34). Mice under restriction may, therefore,
defend their fat stores because they perceive no diminution

in the risk of starvation. An additional factor was that the fat
stores of these mice were relatively small (9.5% of total
body mass before restriction); hence, the capacity to eat into
these reserves may have been limited. How rodents partition
energy deficits between lean and fat tissue seems to depend
on the strain, species, and age of the animals involved.
Other studies have generated similar data to the responses of
our mice to caloric restriction, showing defense of fat tissue
and withdrawal of lean tissue (21), whereas some studies
have indicated greater use of fat tissue (35), and yet others
suggest no differential use of the different compartments
(36). At present, why such differences pertain remains un-
clear.
There is a lot of conflicting evidence in the literature
regarding the extent of compensatory mechanisms that are
the result of different methods used to correct for body mass
changes. Blanc et al. (37) stated that ANCOVA is the most
statistically appropriate method to compare dietarily re-
stricted RMR or TEE against controls, using FFM or BM as
a covariate. They found that RMR was lower in a wide
weight range of restricted animals and humans in relation to
FFM. We applied the same methodology and found that
RMR was not reduced beyond that expected from FFM
reductions in the restricted mice. The relative reduction in
RMR due to reduced FFM helps to bring the animal back
into energy balance.
It may be that the extent of restriction in our study was
insufficient to generate metabolic compensation in RMR.
Blanc et al. (37) used repeated measures ANCOVA to
formulate two equations from which RMR could be pre-
dicted using FFM measured in the restricted or ad libitum
state. This equation was used to predict RMR for our mice
at known FFM. Control mice with an FFM of 35.22 grams
were predicted to have an RMR of 26.24 2.64 kJ/d, which
was not significantly different from the value we measured
(paired Student’s t test, T  0.84, p  0.43). The same is
also true using the restricted equation and a restricted FFM
of 33.0 grams, which predicted an RMR of 24.74  1.59
kJ/d (paired Student’s t test, T  0.10, p  0.92). Conse-
quently, although restricted mice did not lower their RMR
in relation to FFM, the values that we observed were also
not significantly different from the expectations based on
the Blanc et al. (37) study.
As mentioned previously, there may also be a difference
in the extent of compensation observed depending on the
time of day that measurements are taken. Rats on 30% to

40% caloric restriction measured during the afternoon pe-
riod did not show any difference in RMR, whereas those
measured in the evening or night periods showed an increas-
ing degree of difference (38). The differences may depend
on the amount of time since the last meal. In Rothwell and
Stock’s (38) study, for example, mice were fed at 9 AM;
thus, the two measurements were progressively further
away from feeding time. In the current study, RMR mea-
surements were distributed between morning (before feed-
ing) and afternoons (after feeding). When our data were
split into the two categories, morning and afternoon mea-
surements were not significantly different from each other.
This indicates that the heat increment of feeding in these
rodents is a relatively small part of their resting energy
demands. This is probably because of the high carbohydrate
content of the standard rodent diet. Extrapolating the mea-
surements of RMR that we made during daytime over the
entire 24-hour period may induce some errors because it is
generally suggested that there is a 24-hour circadian cycle in
RMR, with rodents showing greater levels during the noc-
turnal phase. However, measuring RMR at night is confused
by the fact that if rodents are restricted from feeding at this
time, which is their natural feeding time, they generally
show a period of hyperactivity linked to searching for food,
which compromises obtaining a true resting value. Mohan
and Narasinga Rao (39) suggested that the age of the animal
might explain why some studies find no effect of restriction
on RMR. They state that energy restriction may not result in
a reduction in metabolism in growing animals because the
decreased body size is a result of growth retardation rather
than tissue loss, which would occur in older weight-stable
animals.
Reductions in the energy expended on activity showed
the greatest adjustment to accommodate for the reduced
energy availability. Hill et al. (7) estimated the partition of
ingested energy after 25% and 50% restriction compared
with controls. They used similar methods to the current
study by extrapolating from short-term measurements of
energy expenditure to 24-hour values and assuming that
unaccountable energy expenditure must be due to activity
costs. They estimated that physical activity was reduced
only after a 50% reduction, whereas RMR was reduced in
both restriction levels. At 25% restriction, they assigned the
majority of compensation to RMR rather than activity.
Contrary to the Hill et al. (7) study, and more in line with
the current findings, activity levels measured using im-
planted transmitters in rats restricted by 25% declined from
5392 to 3582 counts (a reduction of 44%) (11), and Rhesus
monkeys reduced physical activity during 12 months of
30% restriction (40). One study used a calorimetric device,
which could assign an energy cost directly to total energy
expenditure and spontaneous activity, and found that during
mild caloric restriction, there was no reduction in energy
expended on activity, but a significant decrease of 50% was
observed with more severe restriction (17). Energy assigned
to activity is clearly a very flexible component of the energy
expenditure, which gives great scope for variable compen-
sation during restriction.
One surprising observation in the present study was that
body temperature was not reduced in response to dietary
restriction. It is possible that the lack of decline in temper-
ature was an artifact because the restricted animals always
became more active when someone entered the room in
anticipation of feeding. In a study of 25% caloric restriction
in rats, core body temperature was measured with internally
implanted transmitters, which meant that animals did not
need to be disturbed or handled to measure this parameter.
Body temperature declined by 0.04 °C every 24 hours of
restriction (10). In contrast, however, a study of spiny mice
(Acoyms russatus), which also measured temperature using
a non-invasive methodology, found that during 50% food
restriction, RMR was reduced by 50% without a change in
body temperature (41).
In summary, the present study suggests that mice are able
to rapidly and completely compensate for a reduction in
energy intake by altering components of their energy bal-
ance. At 20% restriction, the mechanisms they used did not
include alterations in digestive efficiency. Rather, the ani-
mals reduced their RMR by reducing the amount of FFM
they carried while protecting their fat stores. The greatest
contribution to the compensation was made by reductions in
physical activity.
