ABSTRACT
The Arabidopsis Co-expression Tool, ACT, ranks the
genes across a largemicroarray dataset according to
how closely their expression follows the expression
of a query gene. A database stores pre-calculated
co-expression results for 21 800 genes based on
data from over 300 arrays. These results can be cor-
roborated by calculation of co-expression results for
user-defined sub-sets of arrays or experiments from
the NASC/GARNet array dataset. Clique Finder (CF)
identifies groups of genes which are consistently
co-expressed with each other across a user-defined
co-expression list. The parameters can be altered
easily to adjust cluster size and the output examined
for optimal inclusion of genes with known biolog-
ical roles. Alternatively, a Scatter Plot tool displays
the correlation coefficients for all genes against two
user-selected queries on a scatter plot which can be
useful for visual identification of clusters of genes
with similar r-values. User-input groups of genes
can be highlighted on the scatter plots. Inclusion of
genes with known biology in sets of genes identified
using CF and Scatter Plot tools allows inferences
to be made about the roles of the other genes in the
set and both tools can therefore be used to generate
short lists of genes for further characterization.

INTRODUCTION
Microarray data contain information on the relative expression
levels in a tissue sample for the thousands of genes represented
by probes on the array. Large collections of microarray data
therefore contain information about concerted changes in tran-
script levels in these datasets beyond the original purpose of
each experiment. The NASC/GARNet array data are one such
data collection, containing results from many experiments
analysing the responses in Arabidopsis to differing biotic
and abiotic conditions and analysing mutants and a range of
developmental stages (1).
A number of bioinformatics resources allow information to
be recovered for individual genes from this and other micro-
array databases [e.g. The Arabidopsis Information Resource
(TAIR) (2), NASCArrays tools (1), Stanford Microarray Data-
base (3), Botany Array Resource (4) and Genevestigator (5)].
However, as the first microarray data became available, it was
realized that this represented a mine of information for how
genes were regulated and acted together (6) allowing pre-
dictions to be made about the co-regulation of genes from
the correlation of their expression patterns. Indeed, in plant
science, gene co-expression analysis has been used recently
to predict biology and to inform experimental approaches,
e.g. (7–9) and web-based tools reporting co-expression results
based on Arabidopsis microarray data have become available
[Botany Array Resource (4), Gene Recommender (10),
CSB.DB (11) and Arabidopsis Co-expression Tool, ACT,
(12)] making such tools available for all biologists. A range
of different features are offered by these websites each with
their own advantages.
ACT provides co-expression analysis for 21 891 genes,
based on Affymetrix Arabidopsis Ath1 microarray data
from the NASC/GARNet dataset. Our Clique Finder (CF)
tool provides objective dissection of co-expression lists for
genes consistently co-expressed with each other. The Scatter
Plot tool allows visualization of the correlation values for all
genes against two queries, with the facility to highlight sets
of genes of interest, e.g. the members of a gene family. Iden-
tifying and visualizing marker genes with known biology
(or ‘guide genes’), (11) in co-expression datasets is a valuable

approach to determining cut-off values giving sets of genes for
further analysis. Here we illustrate the features of ACT using
two transcription factors forming part of the circadian clock
of Arabidopsis.
ACT, CLIQUE FINDER AND SCATTER PLOT
SOFTWARE
Data handling and processing
ACT uses microarray data from the GARNet/NASCArrays (1)
set, processed by the Affymetrix MAS5.0 analysis algorithms.
Correlation values were based on the signal values output by
this software. Probe sets showing no detection of expression in
any experiment were deleted, and values of expression signals
below a cut-off of 20 signal units in particular experiments
were set to 20 to eliminate any chance correlations with these
noisy low signal values.
Correlation calculations
The WWW server is backed by a database containing all
experimental data and annotations and GO terms. The data-
base also contains pre-calculated correlation values over all
experiments, allowing fast processing of these user queries.
When the user defines a subset of the arrays, correlation cal-
culations are carried out ‘on the fly’, since pre-storage of all
possibilities is impractical and, in consequence, these user
queries run more slowly.
The starting point for most users will be the Keyword
Search tool which reports a list of genes likely to be of interest,
with links to the pre-calculated co-expression data for each
probe set. Alternatively, a tool is provided for conversion of
AGI codes to Affymetrix probe IDs or, if known, the Correla-
tion List can be recalled by entering a probe set ID of interest.
A typical ACT output is shown in Figure 1. This tool returns a
list of the array probe sets ranked by r-value for the correlation
of their expression patterns. P-values and E-values are given
as measures of the statistical significance of the observed
correlation. By default, the 50 top-ranked probe sets are
reported, but results for all 21 891 valid probe sets are avail-
able if requested. The full list is useful for examination of the
anti-correlated genes. The AGI code represents a hyperlink to
TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org) for more information and access
to other external databases. Clicking on any Affymetrix probe
ID in a list from the pre-calculated database returns the 50
best-correlated genes for this new query, allowing biologists
to browse lists giving a subjective feeling for genes which may
be consistently highly ranked on co-expression lists. For
co-expression calculation using user-defined arrays, the output
lists the arrays used for the calculation and then gives the full
co-expression list from query gene itself through positively
correlated genes to the most anti-correlated genes. A link for
each experiment in the database opens a new window at NASC
giving the information about each experiment. ACT lists can
be saved as text files and opened in a spread-sheet program
(in a tab-delimited format).
Themes to sets of co-expressed genes can be determined
using our Word and GO counting tools to detect over-
represented words or GO terms for the top-ranked probe
sets. The significance of any over-representation is estimated
by hypergeometric distribution analysis. These tools can be
more informative than visual inspection of the annotations
of the best-correlated genes as they provide a statistical
basis to distinguish between common terms and genuinely
over-represented ones.
Clique finder tool
The CF tool (illustrated in Figure 2) constructs clusters of
genes with very similar expression patterns within the list
of the top k genes correlated with a given query probe set.
The algorithm allows overlap between clusters, so in contrast
to traditional clustering methods for microarray data, each
gene can potentially be shown to be involved in more than
one type of biological response. The method used is based on
the graph theoretical concept of a maximal clique.
Given a query probe set ID and a number of neighbours, k,
as input, we first retrieve the top k probe sets from the database,
ranked by Pearson correlation coefficient with respect to the
query. Owing to the computational complexity of the clique
finding algorithm, we currently support up to a maximum of
k ¼ 100 neighbours. A second database query then obtains
all the correlation coefficients between all possible pairs of
these genes. The genes are represented as vertices in a graph
representation, and the links between each pair of genes are
considered as weighted edges, where the edge weight is equal
to the Pearson correlation coefficient between those two genes.
We keep only the strongest c% of these edges according to a
cut-off value set by the user, typically between 1 and 10%.
This removes all anti-correlation edges and retains only those
positive correlation edges with the strongest support. The
graph representation is now an unweighted simple graph
which is relatively sparse.
A standard algorithm (13) is now used to find all maximal
cliques within the graph. A clique is a subset of vertices that
are all connected to each other by edges, and in a maximal
clique there are no more vertices that can be added to the
clique such that this condition holds. A clique can reveal
interesting biology because all its members are strongly cor-
related with each other. However, there is often significant
overlap between cliques, and in this case it makes sense to
combine them into clusters. Any clique sharing at least 50% of
its genes with an overlapping clique is considered to be a
‘neighbour’ of that clique. A simple single-linkage clustering
procedure joins all neighbouring cliques into clusters of probe
sets. These clusters and the unclustered singletons are then
output for inspection. Clicking on any probe set ID in the
output in turn produces the CF result for that gene.
Scatter Plot tool
Another tool allows users to visualize the correlation of all
genes against two probe sets simultaneously. Every probe set
in the dataset is plotted on a scatter graph, where the two axes
are the Pearson correlation coefficients against two different
query probe sets (Figure 3). With two query probe sets
involved in the same biological process, this tool gives the
user an intuitive feel for the degree of correlation, and also
makes it easy to identify groups of probe sets that are strongly
correlated or anti-correlated with the query probe sets. Using
an HTML image map, each probe set on the scatter plot has a
link to its corresponding annotation information at TAIR.

Implementation
The microarray data were stored in a MySQL database. The
correlation calculations were implemented in C and theWWW
interface (including Correlation List and Scatter Plot tools)
was implemented using the Apache WWW server and Perl/
PHP. The Clique Finder algorithm was implemented in Java.

SCATTER PLOT TOOLS
Co-expression output
The circadian clock in plants regulates many aspects of plant
growth and development including changes in gene expression
that are central to many core functions. In Arabidopsis, some
of the genes which constitute the clock have been identified
but many of the signalling inputs and outputs are still to be
characterized. Two components of the ‘central oscillator’ are
myb transcription factor genes, cca1 and lhy. The pre-
calculated co-expression list for lhy is shown in Table 1
(for space reasons, most of the information reported on the
web pages has been removed) revealing co-expression of lhy
and cca1 with each other, with another myb gene (At3g09600)
and with a CONSTANS-like transcription factor. One
approach to corroborating such correlations is to calculate
the co-expression values using a different set of data and
comparing the two lists. The result of such a calculation,
from a small number of arrays (42 arrays from three experi-
ments selected based on biological knowledge of lhy and cca1
expression patterns) is also given in Table 1. The high r-values
for genes at the top of each list indicate strong co-expression of
these genes with the query. The different r-values reflect the
use of different datasets for the calculations; the datasets for
the user-defined calculation were derived from experiments
using similar tissues thus producing higher r-values compared
with the pre-calculated database which is based on a wide
range of tissues. Genes common to these lists of the top-ranked
15 genes are indicated in bold type with genes of one list also
present in the top 100 (i.e. top 1⁄2%) of the other list indicated in
italics. Clearly there are many genes common to both lists,
supporting the suggestion that these are a set of genes which
are co-expressed and therefore whose expression is indeed
likely to be regulated in a similar manner. This represents a
valuable prediction, especially for the unannotated genes in
these lists.
Clique finder
However, visual examination of two lists is very slow and
there is subjectivity as to how far down two lists a user
would be prepared to look for genes in common. Beyond
the visual examination of two co-expression lists for genes
in common, the CF tool uses a more complex algorithm for the
prediction of biological relevance, searching a co-expression
list (corresponding to a single query gene) for other genes that
are consistently co-expressed with each other (Figure 2). The
CF output for the cca1 myb gene is presented in Table 2
(copied from the Web page and edited slightly). At the top
of the page are the identifiers and annotations for the query
gene and below this are the parameters used in the CF search.

allow the biologist to explore how these parameters affect
cluster size and representation of genes with known biology
in each cluster.
Cluster 2 contains the three myb genes seen in the
co-expression lists, namely cca1, lhy and the uncharacterized
myb gene At3g09600. Another transcription factor
(CONSTANS-LIKE 2) and some unannotated genes are pre-
sent in cluster 2 supporting the suggestion that they are indeed
regulated in a similar manner. Overall, CF cluster 2 is very
similar to the genes common to the two co-expression lists
presented in Table 1, suggesting that, of the 100 top-ranked
genes,9 of them are indeed predicted to be co-regulated. The
remaining genes of this list of 100 may be regulated in a
different manner or have other signalling inputs thus changing
their behaviour. Support for the validity of Cluster 2 as a
co-regulated set of genes comes from published work analys-
ing effects of red light on gene expression in Arabidopsis (14);
expression of the genes highlighted in bold type in Table 2
responds to illumination with red light. This observed
enrichment suggests that the other genes of the set may
also be red light-responsive, matching the behaviour of the
‘guide genes’, and further suggests that ACT and CF can be
used to suggest roles for poorly-characterized genes.
The choice of parameters for the Clique Finder algorithm
will determine how many genes are included in each cluster or
are unclustered and therefore how many genes are included in
short lists for further analysis. More aggressive parameters,
giving smaller cluster sizes, would be appropriate for low-
throughput follow-up analyses (such as characterisation of
mutant plants), whereas less stringent criteria will give larger
clusters more appropriate for high-throughput analyses such as
printing of custom microarrays or bioinformatic analyses.
While larger clusters may include more ‘false positives’
(genes incorrectly included in the cluster), they might also
include more ‘true positives’ and this would offer the oppor-
tunity to identify a biological role for a larger set of genes if
an appropriate screen is available. Conversely, characteriza-
tion of small clusters, perhaps excluding well-characterized
‘guide genes’ giving a ‘false negative’ result, represents a lost
opportunity to identify functions for the uncharacterized genes
also incorrectly excluded from the cluster.
Co-correlation scatter plots
Co-expression lists are not necessarily a good format for
looking at many more than a few top-ranked genes. Therefore,
we developed a Scatter Plot tool for visualization of correla-
tion results for all 21 891 genes in our database with two query
genes. The output from this tool can reveal groups of genes
better correlated with one query than the other, or well
separated from the bulk of the genes, which may empirically

into clusters of probe

suggest r-value cut-offs. Additionally, this tool can be used to
highlight a group of genes, e.g. all members of a gene family.
In Arabidopsis there has been expansion of gene families
producing, e.g. 190 myb genes (15) with probes for 177 of
these genes on the Ath1 Affymetrix array. There are three
myb genes co-expressed in a cluster identified by CF, but other
myb genes were also highly ranked in the co-expression list.
Lhy and cca1 show similar expression patterns and are
therefore ideal query genes for the Scatter Plot tool giving
a positive correlation against the other genes in the database
(Figure 3). The two query genes have correlation values of
1.0 with themselves, are strongly correlated with each other
and are therefore located at the top right of the figure. This
visual presentation allows an empirical identification of a set
of genes more strongly expressed with the query genes than
the bulk of the genes.
Highlighting all myb genes on the Ath1 array on the Scatter
Plot (Figure 3) reveals that expression of most myb genes is
poorly correlated with cca1 and lhy, but At3g09600 and an
additional gene (At1g01520) are strongly co-expressed with
the two query genes and may merit further analysis. Indeed,
both At3g09600 and At1g01520 have been suggested as genes
which may play roles in the circadian clock in addition to
cca1 and lhy (16). The Scatter Plot visual analysis indicates
that expression of other myb genes, with similar sequences
to lhy and cca1, is not correlated with the genes analysed
here and therefore they are likely to play different roles.
DISCUSSION
There are many possible statistical approaches to measure
correlation, including the Pearson correlation coefficient,
the Spearman rank and others (17). Each has theoretical
advantages and disadvantages, but it is as yet uncertain
which gives the best results on microarray data. ACT uses
the simplest of these measures, the Pearson correlation (r).
We have found this to be effective (12) and that similar results
are produced by other approaches. It has the advantage
that calculation of the statistical significance of the observed
correlation (P-value) is straightforward. It is clear that no
single correlation value (r) or P-value cut-off could be used
routinely for selecting a set of genes showing strong

co-expression as these values will be affected by factors
including the datasets used and the biological processes
involved. Rather, interpretation of co-expression patterns is
facilitated by biological knowledge of the relevant system and
therefore our tools encourage an exploration of the data and
allow visualization of results to help users identify short lists of
genes for further analysis.
Many users of ACT will choose to analyse output lists for
single genes, examining the annotations for over-represented
themes and keywords of interest. Our Word and GO counting
tools provide a statistical basis for interpreting such themes.
Sets of co-expressed genes will be useful inputs into tools
such as Genevestigator (5) providing additional types of
information. In addition, sets of co-expressed genes may be
mapped onto databases of Gene Ontology and metabolic path-
way information (18,19) to help identify the biological pro-
cesses in operation. Similarly, analysis of the promoters of a
set of co-expressed genes for over-represented motifs [e.g.
(20)] may give confidence in transcription factor-binding
site prediction which would not be possible by comparison
of a single promoter against a database of known motifs.
The results for an individual microarray experiment are
likely to be the sum of a number of (potentially interacting)
processes. From amongst a set of genes identified by micro-
array analysis with significant fold changes in their expression
levels, ACT and CF may be useful to identify the different sets
of genes which are co-expressed with each other but where
each set of genes is responding to a different stimulus. Indeed,
the inclusion of genes with small expression level fold changes
in such sets may be supported by ACT if they are strongly
co-expressed with other genes with larger expression level
fold changes.
Modelling gene networks will involve ‘the collection,
description and systematization of network elements’ (21)
requiring information with a high level of coverage of the
possible elements of a system. ACT provides co-expression
results for more probe sets than other similar tools,
including genes likely to be expressed at a low level and in
a small proportion of the experiments. Comparison of our
co-expression predictions for a group of myb transcription
factors with independent results from the literature supports
our approaches. ACT therefore provides tools to allow inclu-
sion of many genes in co-regulated sets (or exclusion from
those sets) allowing predictions to be made about signalling
networks which can then be tested experimentally.
