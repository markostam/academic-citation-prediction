ABSTRACT
G-quadruplex (or G4 DNA), a stable four-stranded
structure found in guanine-rich regions, is impli-
cated in the transcriptional regulation of genes
involved in growth and development. Previous
studies on the role of G4 DNA in gene regulation
mostly focused on genomic regions proximal to
transcription start sites (TSSs). To gain a more
comprehensive understanding of the regulatory
role of G4 DNA, we examined the landscape of
potential G4 DNA (PG4Ms) motifs in the human
genome and found that G4 motifs, not restricted to
those found in the TSS-proximal regions, are bias
toward gene-associated regions. Significantly, ana-
lyses of G4 motifs in seven types of well-known
gene regulatory elements revealed a constitutive
enrichment pattern and the clusters of G4 motifs
tend to be colocalized with regulatory elements.
Considering our analysis from a genome evolu-
tionary perspective, we found evidence that the
occurrence and accumulation of certain progenitors
and canonical G4 DNA motifs within regulatory
regions were progressively favored by natural
selection. Our results suggest that G4 DNA motifs
are ‘colonized’ in regulatory regions, supporting a
likely genome-wide role of G4 DNA in gene
regulation. We hypothesize that G4 DNA is a
regulatory apparatus situated in regulatory
elements, acting as a molecular switch that can
modulate the role of the host functional regions,
by transition in DNA structure.
INTRODUCTION
Certain types of guanine (G)-rich sequences can
spontaneously fold into a stable four-stranded DNA
structure, which is comprised of stacked G-quartets
arranged from four Hoogsteen paired guanines, known
as G-quadruplex or G4 DNA (1–4). A growing body of
evidence indicates that G4 DNA structures are involved in
various cellular functions, particularly in transcriptional
regulation (2,5–7).
The formation of G4 DNA structures in the promoters
ofMYC, KRAS, PDGFA and INS genes has a remarkable
inﬂuence on the level of gene transcription (8–16). An
increasing number of G4 DNA-forming sequences have
been identiﬁed and characterized in functional regions
(e.g. promoters and enhancers) of many important cell
growth-related genes including KIT, HIF1A, VEGFA,
BCL2, RB1 and in various muscle-speciﬁc genes (17–25).
In addition to these detailed studies on speciﬁc gene loci,
several recent genome-wide analyses highlight multiple
potential regulatory roles of G4 DNA structure.
First, G4 DNA structure forming sequences are
prevalent throughout the human genome (26,27), raising
the possibility that this DNA structural motif could act as
a general regulatory signal. Second, the potential to form
G4 DNA within the transcribed region of genes correlates
with functional preferences, suggesting that genes with
similar or related function could be coregulated based
upon the presence of G4 DNA signal (28). Third, potential
G4 DNA motifs (PG4Ms) in the transcription start site
(TSS)-proximal region and promoter were associated with
genome-wide gene expression, supporting a widespread
role for G4 DNA in gene transcription (29–31). Lastly,
bioinformatic studies revealed that PG4Ms were
enriched in several functional regions including pro-
moters, TSS-proximal regions, nuclease hypersensitive
sites, RNA processing sites, 30-untranslated regions and,
most recently, in recombination hotspots (30,32–38),
indicating multiple potential roles for G4 DNA in
genome function.
In totality, these ﬁndings suggest that G4 DNA could be
a common structural motif involved in gene regulation via
various mechanisms. Since gene regulation is a systematic

process controlled by many types of cis-regulatory
elements and related trans-regulatory proteins (39),
we hypothesized a functional association between G4
DNA and various gene regulatory elements. We asked
whether a unique distribution of G4 motifs reﬂects their
functional importance and whether the regulatory roles of
G4 DNA are substantiated through pre-existing regulatory
elements. Each of these possibilities are supported by the
ﬁndings that potential G4 motifs are unevenly distributed
in the human genome with a strong bias toward gene-
associated regions, and that potential G4 motifs are
constitutively enriched in seven types of well-known
regulatory elements including TSS-proximal regions,
nuclease hypersensitive sites, CpG islands, enhancers,
insulators, conserved non-coding regulatory sequences
and conserved transcription factor-binding sites. Herein,
we demonstrate that this phenomenon was progressively
favored by natural selection during the evolution of the
human genome. Based on these ﬁndings we hypothesize
that G4 DNA motifs are ‘colonized’ in regulatory
elements where they may act as a structure-based
regulatory apparatus for genome-wide gene regulation,
and that this feature probably deﬁnes a general strategy
for G4 DNA-mediated gene regulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Identiﬁcation of PG4Ms
PG4Ms were identiﬁed using a previously described
program, Quadparser, developed by Huppert et al.
Detailed instructions for using this program have been
fully described elsewhere (27). Brieﬂy, Quadparser
recognizes DNA sequences that have four or more
G-runs which contain three or more continuous Gs as a
potential G4 DNA motif (G3N1–7G3N1–7G3N1–7G3;
where N refers to any base). Because genomic DNA is
presented as a single strand, both G- and C-patterns
(C3N1–7C3N1–7C3N1–7C3) were applied to identify
PG4Ms on both strands. Two points should be noted
here. (i) PG4Ms mentioned in this study and identiﬁed
by Quadparser refer to distinctive G4 DNA-forming
sequences that do not overlap with others. For example,
if a DNA sequence contains six G-runs (sequence denoted
in box brackets) each of which has at least three
continuous Gs: [GGG]TAT[GGG]TAT[GGG]TAT[GG
G]TAT[GGG]TAT[GGG], then three overlapping G4
structures might theoretically be formed using the ﬁrst
(1–4), the middle (2–5) or the last four (3–6) G-runs.
However, Quadparser outputs this sequence as only one
distinctive PG4M to avoid predicting multiple G4-forming
sites from a single region of DNA. (ii) In many cases, each
identiﬁed single PG4M could form diverse types of G4
structure with diﬀerent topological arrangements by
diﬀerentially assigning a Guanine into the G-quartet or
loop regions. Again, the Quadparser recognizes it as a
single distinctive G4-forming site. For example, the
DNA sequence GGGGACGGGCACGGGTAAGGG
can potentially form two types of G4 DNA by assigning
the forth G either into the G-quartet (G[GGG]ACT[G
GG]CAC[GGG]TAA[GGG]) or the ﬁrst loop region
([GGG]GACT[GGG]CAC[GGG]TAA[GGG]). The
default rule for PG4M identiﬁcation was ‘GC 3417’ in
which GC represents G- and C- pattern, ‘3’ represents
the minimal length of G-run, ‘4’ represents the minimal
number of G-run, and ‘17’ represents the range of the
length of the loop. The prediction rule can be revised to
identify other G4-related motifs. Here, we modiﬁed
the 3417 rule to ‘GC 2417’, ‘GC 3317’, etc. to identify
progenitor or mock PG4Ms according to the speciﬁc
purpose (see main text for detail). Since mRNA is
single-stranded only G-pattern was applied to predict
PG4Ms and G4-related motifs in mRNA sequence (e.g.
‘G 3417’, ‘G 2417’, etc.).
DNA sequences and GREs
DNA sequences for the human genome (Hg18) were
downloaded directly from the UCSC genome browser
(40). Only assembled sequences were used to analyze the
genome-wide location of PG4Ms. Genomic coordinates of
the TPR (from 500 to +500) were obtained from
‘RefSeq Gene’ track of UCSC genome browser (Hg18);
CGIs were obtained from ‘CpG Island’ track of UCSC
(Hg 18) and NHSs were obtained from ‘Duck DNase
Sites’ track of UCSC (Hg 17) (41). The proﬁle of
PG4Ms in NHSs (5158 sites) was analyzed in a previous
study (32), but in the study presented here we used a much
more comprehensive dataset (95 723 sites); cTFBS were
obtained from ‘TFBS conserved’ track of UCSC (Hg18).
cTFBSs were predicted on the basis of sequence similarity
to the consensus sequence of known TFs and on sequence
conservation across human/mouse/rat genomes. To
ensure reliability of the data, only cTFBSs that have a Z
score 2.33 (corresponding to a P value of 0.01) and that
do not overlap with exonic sequences were used. Since
cTFBSs are short (typically between 6–12 bp in length)
discrete sequences which make it unfeasible to directly
calculate the frequency of PG4Ms, we clustered the
cTFBSs based on density (cTFBS cluster). cTFBSs that
occurred within a distance of 500 bp were combined and
the clusters that (i) contain ﬁve or more cTFBSs and (ii)
are longer than 100 bp, were used in the following
analysis. The DNA sequences for the above-described
UCSC deposited regulatory elements that were extracted
directly from the UCSC browser. For other literature-
reported GREs, a bed ﬁle was created and uploaded
into the UCSC custom track to download the sequences
from corresponding genome assemble. Speciﬁcally,
coordinates of the human insulator were obtained from
the CTCF-binding site database (CTCFBSDB) (42),
where only those insulators identiﬁed experimentally by
ChIP-chip (43) or ChIP-seq (44) were used for analysis.
Predicted cis-regulatory modules identiﬁed by
evolutionary and sequence pattern extraction through
reduced representation (ESPERR) were obtained from
Taylor et al. (45). Regions with a regulatory potential
(RP) score of at least 0.05 for at least 200 bp and that
do not overlap with known exons [referred to as noncod-
ing regulatory sequences (NCRS)] were used for further
analysis (downloaded from http://www.bx.psu.edu/
ross/dataset/DatasetHome.html). Human enhancers

predicted from 79 tissues were obtained from Pennacchio
et al. (46); human pseudogenes were obtained from the
Pseudogene.org database (47). The information for
PG4M-positive GREs and nearby genes (within 10 kb)
can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
Data analysis
Genome coordinates among diﬀerent assemblies (e.g.
Hg16, Hg17) were converted to Hg18 using lift over tool
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver). Galaxy
genome analysis tools were used for performing
conversion, intersection, subtraction and combination of
genomic coordinates (48). The conservation score (by
phastCons) for the human genome was obtained from
(49) and assigned to GREs. All GREs were pooled and
sorted according to their average conservation scores
(phastCons score, based on 17-species alignment), where
GREs with a score lower than 0.1 were excluded.
Sequences are simulated through a ﬁrst-order Markov
chain model using sliding windows, which may more
accurately reﬂect the nucleotide arrangement than
sequence permutation. The Markov chain is a pro-
babilistic model describing the state transition that
future states, which will be reached through a probabilistic
process, depend only upon the present state. For each
window, the Markov transition probabilities for bases
A, T, G and C were computed from the real sequence.
The simulation sequence for this window was then
generated based on the 4 4 transition matrix with the
ﬁrst base generated according to the overall base
frequencies. Beginning from the 50-end, the window
moved along the DNA sequence; the whole chromosome
was simulated in this manner. Since the window size
aﬀects simulation output, we tested window sizes of
various lengths (from 50 to 200 bp). The ratio of
observed to expected (O/E) number of PG4M was found
to be equal to 1 in the real genome when the size was
120 bp. We, thus, reported results using the window size
of 120 bp, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
RESULTS
Landscape of PG4Ms in the human genome
PG4Ms, G3N1–7G3N1–7G3N1–7G3 and C3N1–
7C3N1–7C3N1–7C3 (where the C pattern represents
PG4Ms in the negative DNA strand) were prevalent;
while at the same time, they were shown to be unevenly
distributed in the human genome (Supplementary Figure
S1). Basically, if the PG4Ms were randomly distributed
then the number of PG4Ms counted on a given genomic
length could be modeled as a Poisson process. For a large
value of  (>10), the Poisson distribution could be
approximated by the Normal distribution N (,) (where
 is the mean of the Poisson distribution). Here, we
calculated the number of PG4Ms in 100 kb genomic
windows (mean=12.515). Because the calculation of
PG4Ms was aﬀected by regional GC composition, we
corrected the eﬀects of heterogeneity of chromosome
and GC content by transforming the numbers to
normalized values within each of the chromosomes and
the categories of similar GC content as Z ¼ ðnijÞ=
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ij
p
(where n is the observed number for each window and lij
is the mean for all windows belonging to chromosome
category i and GC-content category j). Under the null
hypothesis that PG4Ms were evenly distributed, we
expected that the normalized values would follow the
Standard Normal distribution. However, the observed
distribution was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to the expectation
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, D=0.082, P< 0.001,
Figure 1A), which was found to be biased toward high
or low values with the standard division of 1.362,
indicating a genome-wide nonuniformity.
By examining the distribution of PG4Ms in the genome
and corresponding genomic features, we observed that
PG4Ms were more likely to occur within gene regions
(GRs, deﬁned as the transcribed sequence of a gene and
the 5-kb ﬂanking region on both sides, so as to include
splice variants). A total of 239 901 PG4Ms were identiﬁed
in 1369.08Mb GRs, producing a frequency of 0.175,
signiﬁcantly higher than the genome average of 0.126
(360 438 PG4Ms in 2858.01Mb). Correlation analysis

showed that the distributions of PG4Ms and GRs were
coupled across the human genome (Spearman q=0.588,
P< 0.001) and this observation was valid for all
human chromosomes (Supplementary Figure S1). As a
representative example shown in Figure 1B for chromo-
some 1, PG4Ms-rich regions are generally colocalized with
gene-rich regions and vice versa.
Because we and others have previously reported that
PG4Ms were enriched in TSS-proximal regions, we
tested whether the positive correlation was exclusively
due to the PG4Ms in this region by recalculating the
correlation coeﬃcient after masking all of the PG4Ms
located in TSS-proximal regions (from 500 to +500).
The correlation between PG4Ms and GRs remained
highly signiﬁcant (Spearman q=0.541, P< 0.001),
suggesting that the co-existence of PG4Ms and genes
could be extended outside the TSS-proximal region.
These results are consistent with the emerging hypo-
thesis that G4 DNA is a regulatory motif involved in
transcriptional regulation. Recently, great attention has
been paid toward investigating or modeling the regulatory
role of PG4Ms in the region proximal to the TSS
(e.g. promoter and speciﬁc TFBSs). The unexplained
co-existence of PG4Ms and genes inspired us to examine
the proﬁle and potential role of PG4Ms in many other
regulatory elements.
Constitutive enrichment of PG4Ms in various gene
regulatory elements
Gene expression is a highly integrated process controlled
by various cis-regulatory elements and corresponding
proteins, whereby their combinations and interactions
set the basis for gene regulation and result in the
spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression (Figure 2A).
Under the assumption that the regulatory role of G4
DNA is substantiated through pre-existing gene
regulatory elements (GREs), seven types of well-known
GREs (both speciﬁc GREs and those regions with high
frequencies of GREs and regulatory potential) were
collected based on genome-wide experimental and compu-
tational studies (Figure 2B) to examine the possible
relationship between PG4Ms and gene regulation.
The speciﬁc GREs analyzed here include: (i) Nuclease
hypersensitive sites (NHSs), an indicator of open
chromatin and highly accessible DNA sequences (41)
and proven reliable guides to identify regulatory
elements (41,50). (ii) Enhancers, cis-regulatory sequences
that elevates the transcription level of an adjacent gene
(51); enhancers can reside within the ﬂanking regions,
introns, UTRs or can be a considerable distance from
the target gene they regulate. (iii) Insulators, DNA
elements that prevent the regulatory eﬀects passing from
one chromatin domain to another, establishing and
maintaining the boundaries of chromatin domains
(52,53). (iv) Conserved transcription factor-binding sites
(cTFBSs), important cis-regulatory sequences that
primarily regulate initiation of gene transcription either
directly or indirectly, through the binding of cognate
transcription factors. In addition, those regions with
high frequency of GREs and high regulatory potentials
also include (v) CpG islands (CGI) and (vi) predicted
regulatory sequences. CGIs are typically associated with
promoter and TSS-proximal regions of genes in vertebrate
genomes, especially with housekeeping genes, and are
regulatory targets of DNA methylation (54). The
predicted regulatory sequences are elements predicted
from multi-species alignments using the ESPERR
method (45). We used such predicted functional
elements, located in noncoding regions (NCRSs), in this
study. Finally, (vii) the TSS-proximal region (TPR) is of
interest, as well; many regulatory elements, such as the
core promoter and a number of cis-regulatory elements,
tend to be located in the region proximal to the TSS and
play an essential role in gene regulation (39). The
enrichment and selection of PG4Ms in the TPR (from
500 to +500) have been previously well studied
(32,34), hence we used it as a positive control in this study.
We found a signiﬁcant discrepancy in the frequency of
PG4Ms between GREs and control regions, including
the bulk genome, intergenic regions and pseudogenes
(Figure 2C). A total of 92 316 PG4Ms (25.6%) were
observed to overlap with known GREs analyzed herein,
and the percentage was great than 4-fold compared to
the assumption that PG4Ms were evenly distributed
throughout the human genome. As shown in Figure 2C,
the frequencies of PG4Ms ranged from 0.32 to 1.23 in
GREs, which were signiﬁcantly higher than that for the
total genome, intergenic regions and pseudogenes (from
0.10 to 0.13) (Mann–Whitney tests, P< 0.001 in all
cases; Bonferroni-corrected). Considering that CGIs are
characterized by a high density of CG dinucleotides and
a high GC content which would lead to overestimation,
the frequency of PG4Ms in CGI was calculated after
masking all CpG dinucleotides (CGI_CpG–).
Many GREs tend to be located in the TPR, where a
high frequency of PG4Ms has been reported in previous
studies (32,34). We questioned whether the high frequency
of PG4Ms observed in other GREs was due to those
subsets which overlapped with the TPR. Therefore,
we masked all of the GREs that overlap with the TPR
(at least 100 bp) in each dataset and recalculated the
frequency of PG4Ms. Results showed that the frequency
of PG4Ms remained signiﬁcantly higher than the controls,
albeit relatively decreased (Figure 2D, Mann–Whitney
tests, P< 0.001 in all cases; Bonferroni-corrected).
These data indicate that the enrichment of PG4Ms in
GREs is a consequence of a large-scale adoption of this
sequence motif.
Under the neutral model, the accumulation of PG4Ms
could be achieved by an elevation of the GC content in
regions of the genome, led by biased AT to GC mutation
or/and gene conversion that favors the ﬁxation of AT to
GC mutations (55,56). To test this, DNA sequences (1 kb
in length) from GREs and the bulk genome were
randomly selected and classiﬁed into groups according
to the GC content with a uniform scale range (1%). We
compared the frequency of PG4Ms in GREs and the
bulk genome for each group with a similar GC content.
If the higher frequency of PG4Ms observed in GREs is
simply caused by the diﬀerence of GC composition,
we would expect a comparable frequency of PG4Ms

between GREs and bulk genome. As shown in Figure 3A,
however, the frequencies in GREs were signiﬁcantly
higher than that in the bulk genome, when GC content
was considered.
With the observation of the uneven distribution of
PG4Ms in the human genome and their constitutive
enrichment in GREs, we began further tests to determine
whether PG4M in GREs were driven by a neutral
mechanism or natural selection.
PG4Ms in GREs are favored by natural selection
Since the GREs investigated in this study were generally
short (median length 634 bp), it is reasonable to expect
that those GRE sequences share a similar mutation rate
and base composition with their ﬂanking sequences if
no selection force is acting upon that sequence. Thus, we
compared the frequency of PG4Ms in GREs to that of
the ﬂanking sequences. The genomic regions, both
upstream and downstream, with an equal length as that
of the corresponding GRE, were analyzed. In general, we
found that the frequency of PG4Ms in GREs, with
the exception of enhancer regions, contrasted to their
genomic environment with statistical signiﬁcance
(Figure 3B, Kruskal–Wallis test, P< 0.001). Again, this
observation is not consistent with the neutral model
expectation.

To detect the selection on the accumulation of PG4Ms
in GREs in a more straightforward manner, we compared
the number of expected PG4Ms in GREs to the observed
number. Instead of using a permutation approach, we
chose a more sophisticated Markov chain simulation
which has the advantage of keeping not only the base
composition (e.g. GC content), but also other features of
the original sequences such as the frequency of dinu-
cleotides. Since the window size aﬀects the output of
sequence simulation, various window sizes (from 50 to
200 bp) were analyzed for 100 repeats. We computed the
bulk genome and found when the window size was 120 bp,
the observed number of PG4Ms is similar to the simulated
ones (Figure 3C). We, therefore, used this window size to
assess the GREs. We compared the observed and expected
number of PG4Ms in all types of GREs and controls.
The 1 kb TSS-proximal regions (from –500 to +500)
were used as positive controls because PG4Ms in this
region have been previously shown to be under selection.
Nonregulatory sequences were chosen as negative controls
and included randomly selected genomic sequences
(100 000 representative sequences range from 100 bp to
5 kb in length), intergenic regions (10 000 random
sequences), transcribed regions of pseudogenes and the
coding strand of exonic regions (mRNA sequences). The
results were striking in that we found that the O/E ratio
of the number of PG4Ms was signiﬁcantly higher in all of
the GREs compared to those observed for the controls
(Figure 3D, t-tests, P< 0.001 for all cases, Bonferroni-
corrected). It suggests that the PG4Ms in the GREs
were favored by natural selection. In addition, our
results were consistent with previous ﬁndings that
Figure 3. PG4Ms in GREs are favored by natural selection. (A) The relationship between GC content and frequency of PG4Ms were examined in
bulk genome and GREs, respectively. Frequencies of PG4Ms were calculated in 1-kb windows, randomly selected from the bulk genome (red) and
GREs (blue) and grouped by GC content with a uniform scale range (1%). Only GC content within the normal range of the human genome
(40–60%) are shown. (B) Frequency of PG4Ms in GREs contrasted with their genomic environment. Frequencies of PG4Ms in GREs (red bars), in
the GRE-upstream and GRE-downstream regions (with equal length to the GREs) are plotted for each type of GRE. (C) Inﬂuence of diﬀerent
window sizes of the Markov simulation (50–200 bp) on the ratio of observed number of PG4Ms to that of expected (O/E) was modeled for the bulk
genome (100 times). (D) PG4Ms in GREs are favored by natural selection. O/E values were calculated for each type of GRE and controls.
The standard variations for the O/E values (Markov simulations, 100 repeats) are too low to be visualized in the ﬁgure.

PG4Ms were signiﬁcantly repressed in mRNA sequences
(27), as we observed a low O/E value (<1) for PG4Ms
in mature mRNA sequences.
Progenitors of PG4Ms in GREs are favored by
natural selection
Typically, a DNA sequence that contains four stretches of
G-runs with at least three continuous Gs and interrupted
by one to seven bases is identiﬁed as a PG4M, expressed
by the rule of G3N1–7G3N1–7G3N1–7G3 (G4-3417).
The number of G-runs (at least four) is equivalent to the
four Gs in the G-quartet, and the number of Gs (at least
three) in each G-run is equivalent to the number of
G-quartet in G4 DNA (Figure 4A). This is a complex
motif, hence, the gain and accumulation of PG4Ms in
GREs would not be expected to be accomplished very
quickly. In order to track the process of evolution, the
prediction rule of PG4M was ﬁrst modiﬁed to predict
the ‘PG4M progenitor’ by changing the minimal number
of G-runs (Figure 4B). We compared the O/E values
of PG4Ms progenitors between GREs and controls
Figure 4. Progenitor PG4Ms are favored by selection in GREs. To analyze the generation and selection of PG4Ms during evolution, we modiﬁed the
prediction rule of PG4Ms (3417) based on the structural property of canonical G4 DNA structure (A). ‘3’ represents the minimal number of
continuous Gs (length of G-run); ‘4’ represents minimal number of G-runs; ‘17’ represents the range of the length of arbitrary bases between G-runs
(loop length, between one and seven bases). Minimal number of G-runs for PG4M prediction (four) was changed to 3/2/1 (B and C–F) and the
minimal length of G-run (three) was changed to 2/1 (B and G–I). The ratio of observed to expected (O/E) number of PG4Ms and modiﬁed PG4Ms
was calculated for each type of GRE and control, respectively. The broken blue lines highlight the O/E value for the genome in each case. The
standard variations for Markov simulations (100 repeats) are too low to be visualized in the ﬁgure.

(progenitor–O/E) under the Markov model using a 120-bp
window with 100 replicates. We sequentially reduced the
number of G-runs to three, two and one leading to the
rules of G4-3317, G4-3217 and G4-3117, respectively.
Since a portion of higher-order progenitors could be
special cases of the lower-order progenitor, for example
G4-3317 contains some G4-3417 and G4-3217 contains
some G4-3317 and G4-3417, we excluded all of those
lower-order progenitor motifs that have any overlap
with the higher-order G4-3417 for above analyses to elimi-
nate the inﬂuence of canonical PG4Ms on our observa-
tion. When the number of G-runs is one, the values of O/E
were almost equal for all GREs and controls (Figure 4C),
suggesting that the basic motif of G4-3117 is not favored
by natural selection. However, starting from when the
number of G-run reached two, a disparity of O/E values
occurred between GREs and controls (Mann–Whitney
tests, P< 0.001). This disparity slightly increased when
the number of G-runs increased from two to three as
shown in Figure 4D–E, indicating that the selection
forces increased steadily towards the canonical G4 DNA
structure. We suggest that G4-3217 and G4-3317 would be
progenitor sequences during the selection process since
they could readily produce PG4Ms by the conjunction
of the progenitor sequences, via duplication or recombina-
tion. However, the possibility that G4-3217 and G4-3317
had already gained other functions, besides the formation
of G4 DNA, could not completely ruled out.
We next investigated the inﬂuence of the minimal
number of continuous Gs in each G-run (length of
G-run) on the enrichment of PG4Ms. This was carried
out by reducing the minimal length of each G-run to
two and one base (G4-2417 and G4-1417, respectively;
mock PG4Ms) while other parameters remained
constant. As shown in Figure 4G–I, the O/E values
signiﬁcantly diﬀered between GREs and controls only
when the length of the G-runs reached three guanines
(G4-3417). No obvious diﬀerences in the O/E values
were found between GREs and controls for the reduced
length of G-runs to two or one. Thus, our results
suggested that G-runs with three continuous guanines
were functionally important, consistent with the structural
property of G4 DNA that contributes to formation and
stabilization of G4 DNA typically requiring three or more
G-quartets.
Progressive selection of canonical and progenitor
PG4Ms in GREs during genome evolution
In addition to the detection of the type of selection status,
we further traced the progressive selection of PG4Ms
in GREs on a vertical time axis. Since only canonical
G4-3417 and the progenitor motifs G4-3317 and
G4-3217 were favored by selection, here we focused on
these three motifs for further analysis. In general,
relatively more conserved GREs (with a higher
phastCons score) tend to be older than less conserved
ones (with a lower phastCons score) that might create
more recently during evolution. All GREs were pooled
and sorted according to the average phastCons scores
(based on 17-species alignment). We calculated the
average O/E values of canonical PG4Ms (G4-3417) as
well as the values of those progenitor PG4Ms in
windows containing 1000 GREs. Interestingly, we found
a strong negative correlation between the phastCons
scores and the average O/E value for all of the motifs
(Figure 5, Pearson correlation r<0.9, P< 0.001 for
each case). Thus, the progenitors G4-3217 (Figure 5C),
G4-3317 (Figure 5B) and canonical G4-3417 (Figure 5A)
were under gradually increasing selection pressure. The
pressure acts toward both canonical structure and
PG4M progenitors in newer GREs.
In summary, we provided evidence that PG4Ms are
under evolutionary selection resulting in a strong
nonuniform and GRE-preferred pattern in the human
genome. The selection process for the occurrence
of PG4Ms in GREs acted on both the length (at least
three continuous Gs) and the number of G-runs
Figure 5. Canonical PG4Ms and PG4M progenitors are progressively selected in GREs during evolution. To analyze the selection for canonical
PG4Ms (G4-3417) and PG4M-progenitors during evolution, GREs were pooled and ranked based on conservation score (phastCons) from 17-species
alignment. The average O/E value of PG4Ms (A) and corresponding PG4M progenitors (B and C) was calculated for every 1000 GREs. Sequence
simulations were performed using 120-bp window sizes for 100 repeats.

(at least two), and bring the ‘mature’ PG4Ms into GREs
step-by-step.
Genome-wide colocalization of selected PG4M-enriched
regions with GREs
It is realistic that not all predicted PG4Ms will necessarily
fold into G4 DNA in vivo, the selected PG4M-enriched
regions would be more biologically relevant compare to
individual PG4Ms. Based on the genome-wide density of
PG4Ms, we identiﬁed 18 283 PG4M-clustered regions
(G4 clusters, Supplementary Table S2) according to the
following criteria: (i) there were at least three PG4Ms and
(ii) the maximum distances between the neighboring
PG4Ms in each cluster were no longer than 500 bp.
Although PG4Ms were highly prevalent in the human
genome, G4 clusters were relatively rare and the identiﬁed
number of G4 clusters was signiﬁcantly higher than
expected (Markov simulation, 120 bp), though they
exhibit a similar number of individual PG4Ms. G4
clusters not only showed a high level of G4 frequency
(over 50-fold), but importantly, the frequency was
2.1-fold as compared to that which would be expected
(Markov simulation, 120-bp window). The G4 cluster
represents the hotspots of PG4Ms selection in the
genome. We examined whether the G4 cluster is more
associated with GREs than individual PG4Ms.
We ﬁrst asked whether there is a colocalization
tendency of G4 clusters with GREs. When all overlapping
GREs were merged into a single entity, we found that the
distribution of G4 clusters was generally coupled with
GREs (Supplementary Figure S2). We calculated the
distances between each G4 cluster and its nearest GREs
(deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the coordinates of the
two midpoints) and then determined the median value.
Five thousand sets of random clusters, of which the
number and cluster length were kept identical to actual
G4 clusters, were generated to calculate the null
distribution of this value. We found that the value
obtained from the real genome (482 bp) was signiﬁcantly
smaller than that obtained from the randomized data
(mean=4212 bp) (P< 0.001). This result showed that
G4 clusters were generally close to GREs, indicating a
strong genome-wide colocalization tendency.
We next qualiﬁed the portion of G4 clusters that was
located within each type of GRE, respectively. We found
that the number of G4 clusters overlapping with GREs
was signiﬁcantly higher than would be expected using
the random cluster as a control. The overlap between
G4 clusters and GREs was from 4- to 20-fold as compared
to that observed for the control. Similar results were
obtained for the PG4Ms located in the G4 clusters
(Figure 6A). Using the same approach we next assessed
the portion of individual PG4Ms overlapping with GREs.
Results showed that although the portion of individual
PG4Ms located in GREs was fom 3- to 11-fold in
comparison to the control (number and length were kept
identical to actual PG4Ms), more G4 clusters tended to be
located within regulatory regions for all types of GREs.
Signiﬁcantly, over 60% of the G4 clusters overlapped with
at least one GRE, which was 2.3-fold higher than
individual PG4Ms and was 5-fold as compared to the
random cluster, making the G4 cluster (selected PG4Ms-
enriched regions) a decent feature for predicting
regulatory sequences. Two representative examples are
shown in Figure 6, wherein genomic regions rich in
GREs tend to have a high number of G4 clusters (red,
Figure 6B) and vice-versa (Figure 6C). Speciﬁcally,
many of the G4 clusters are colocalized with GREs
compared to that observed for the control (black, Figure
6B and C). Since the cTFBS clusters analyzed herein
contained a collection of the binding sites of diﬀerent
transcription factors (TFs), we further examined which
TFBSs were speciﬁcally enriched in the G4 cluster. We
analyzed the presence of known TFBSs in the G4
clusters and found 71 TFBSs were signiﬁcantly enriched
in the G4 cluster (Figure 6D and Supplementary Table
S3). This result raises the possibility that G4 DNA
would potentially modulate the binding and regulatory
role of those TFs in speciﬁc cellular conditions.
DISCUSSION
G4 DNA-mediated transcriptional regulation has been
investigated and described in some speciﬁc genes. These
ﬁndings highlighted a regulatory role of this unusual
four-stranded DNA structure and suggest a new
therapeutic approach for cancer therapy using G4 DNA-
based gene modulation via DNA structure speciﬁc ligands
(10,22,57,58). In addition to wet-lab experiments, current
bioinformatic-based studies of potential G4 motifs in the
TSS-ﬂanking region also demonstrated an association
between PG4M and gene regulation, function and
expression levels. Due to the prevalence of PG4Ms in
the human genome, it is interesting to test whether G4
motifs are involved in genome-wide gene regulation to a
greater degree and in a more ubiquitous manner.
Potential implications for the distribution features of
PG4Ms in gene regulation
To date, a large number of regulatory elements encoded in
the human genome have been identiﬁed and characterized
(59). Some of the GREs analyzed herein were speciﬁc
regulatory elements (e.g. insulators and enhancers), some
were regions with a high potential to harbor regulatory
elements (such as NCRSs and NHSs) and some were
identiﬁed in speciﬁc tissues or cell types (e.g. enhancer
and insulator). Our results showed that PG4Ms were
prevalent in all types of GREs examined, and the
frequency of PG4Ms was signiﬁcantly higher than
expected when compared to a number of genomic
controls, indicating that PG4Ms in GREs are favored
during genome evolution.
By examining the current distribution and tracing
the process of evolution for potential G4 DNA motifs,
our results suggest a genome-wide ‘colonization’ of the
regulatory region by PG4Ms in the human genome.
These ﬁndings have led to a hypothesis that G4 DNA is
a regulatory apparatus situated within or near other gene
regulatory elements and the transitions of DNA structure
in PG4Ms might function as molecular switches that

modulate the role of the functional regions wherein they
are situated. This is a biologically ‘intelligent’ strategy
since it takes advantage of the established functions,
regulations and interactions of GREs, and of the ability
of PG4Ms to form alternative structures that can
potentially inﬂuence the activity and behavior of GREs,
hence providing an extensive regulatory role in gene
regulation.
PG4Ms may provide a molecular switch to regulate the
function of GREs
The detailed molecular mechanisms by which G4 DNA
structures regulate gene expression remain largely
unknown although accumulating direct and indirect
evidence obtained both in vivo and in vitro supports the
bona ﬁde existence of functional G4 DNA in vivo (60,61).
Several previous studies proposed speciﬁc potential
models to explain G4 DNA-mediated gene regulation
(7,8,15,25). Having found that potential G4 DNA motifs
are selected for enrichment within or near GREs in the
human genome, we hypothesize that G4 structure-
mediated gene regulation is a common mechanism of
gene regulation (Figure 6).
(i) PG4Ms may regulate the binding of regulatory
proteins in GREs by switching DNA structure
(Figure 7A–C). The interactions between cis-
regulatory elements and corresponding regulatory
proteins are essential for gene regulation. The
PG4Ms in GREs may regulate the recognition and
binding of cognate regulatory proteins, hence
modulating gene expression. Speciﬁcally, the
formation of G4 DNA in PG4Ms would (a)
recruit regulatory proteins that have G4 DNA-
speciﬁc-binding activity (Figure 7A); (b) inhibit the
binding of regulatory proteins (Figure 7B) and (c)
result in distinct protein-binding patterns (Figure
7C) with diﬀerent regulatory consequences. In this
model, the transitions in local DNA structure in
GREs could provide regulatory signals which
could then be sensed and read by the interacting
proteins.
Many G4 DNA-speciﬁc-binding proteins have
been identiﬁed and characterized, some of them
have been further shown to regulate gene expression
(61). For example, a biochemical study suggests that
Pur-1 can stimulate insulin gene transcription by
recognizing G4 DNA formed in the promoter
region (15). Some regulatory proteins preferred
binding at double-stranded or single-stranded
DNA targets, such as Sp1 and single-strand
binding proteins CNBP and hnRNPK associated
with transcriptional regulation of the MYC gene
(62,63). The formation of G4 DNA in the
recognition sites may thus interfere with the
recognition or binding process and, in turn,
inﬂuence gene expression. It has been hypothesized
that formation of G4 DNA in the NHEIII region of
the MYC promoter would block the binding
of speciﬁc transcription factors so as to inhibit
Figure 7. Potential models for G4 DNA-mediated gene regulation. Proposed models for G4 DNA-mediated gene regulation. As described in the
text, formation of G4 DNA structure could contribute to gene regulation by inﬂuencing the function of PG4M hosted regulatory region. G4
structure could inﬂuence binding patterns of corresponding regulatory proteins in regulatory regions (A, B and C), modulate the role of regulatory
elements by its unique biochemical and biophysical properties (D) and regulate the epigenetic properties of target sites such as DNA methylation
status in CpG islands (E) and chromatin architecture of regulatory regions (F). G4 DNA-forming sequence is plotted in blue and corresponding
regulatory proteins are plotted in red.

gene transcription (7,8). In addition, DNA
sequences with diﬀerent structures may recruit
diﬀerent regulatory proteins. In vitro studies
demonstrated that proteins show signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent aﬃnities to DNA molecules with diﬀerent
topologies. For example, MyoD homodimers
preferentially bind to bimolecular G4 DNA, while
MyoD-E47 heterodimers bind more tightly to
double-stranded E-box DNA (7,64). The transitions
of local DNA structures would therefore create
diﬀerent binding proﬁles of regulatory proteins to
regulate gene expression.
Two recently conducted analyses indicate that
PG4Ms (especially those upstream of transcription
start sites) overlap with many G-rich TFBSs
including Sp1, KLF, EKLF, MAZ, EGR-1 and
Ap-2 (65,66). Eddy et al. commented that the
colocalization of PG4Ms with TFBSs would
challenge the notion that the PG4M upstream of
the TSS were involved in gene regulation (66).
However, as mentioned above, we suggest that, on
the contrary, this phenomenon might support the
hypothesis that G4 DNA plays a role in gene
regulation. First, formation of G4 and binding of
TFs could function independently under diﬀerent
situations or in diﬀerent cell types. Second,
although occupancy of G-rich TFBSs by TFs
could hamper the formation of G4 DNA, we
could not rule out the opposite action. Third,
being a mutually exclusive dynamic process for
binding of regulatory protein and formation of G4
DNA, the competition itself could provide a
regulatory mechanism during the course of gene
regulation. Actually, signiﬁcant overlapping of
PG4Ms with many functional elements and the
enrichment of TFBSs in G4 clusters (Figure 6D
and Supplementary Table S3) indicate a potential
interaction. To further investigate this possibility,
it would be interesting to analyze the binding
properties of those regulatory proteins whose
reorganization sites are located in the PG4M-
enriched regions, or to identify the dynamics of in
vivo binding patterns of those proteins by ChIP-chip
or ChIP-seq following the treatment of G4 DNA-
speciﬁc stabilizing or destabilizing ligands.
(ii) G4 DNA may regulate the role of host GREs by its
unique biophysical property (Figure 7D). The
topology of DNA, such as negative supercoiling,
regulates gene expression remarkably (67,68).
Hence, it is possible that G4 structure per se can
regulate cellular function through its unique
biophysical properties. For example, formation of
G4 DNA during DNA replication would hamper
the reading and copying of genetic information
(69,70). Transcription of several G-rich sequences
produces a unique G4 DNA-containing G-loop
structure that contributes to recombination and
hypermutation (71,72). Furthermore, our previous
study hypothesized that G4 DNA stimulates gene
transcription by stabilizing DNA in an open
conformation and rendering the template strand
unpaired for a high rate of transcription (29).
(iii) While DNA sequence elements signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence gene activity, epigenetic mechanisms also
regulate gene function considerably without
changing the DNA sequence (73). It is also
possible that G4 DNA regulates gene expression
through epigenetic mechanisms. CpG islands are
targets of DNA methylation; cytosine methylation
in the CpG context plays an important role in gene
silencing (74). Previous in vitro studies demonstrated
that DNA methyltransferase recognizes and
catalyzes DNA substrates with certain secondary
structures (e.g. hairpins and G4 DNA) at a
remarkable high eﬃciency, suggesting that DNA
conformation would be involved in regulating
DNA methylation (75,76). In this study the CpG
islands are found to be rich in PG4Ms, we thus
propose that PG4Ms in CpG islands would
regulate the level of DNA methylation by folding
into G4 DNA. Although G4 structure has been
proved to facilitate DNA methylation in vitro,
the situation in living cells and whether oppos-
ing functions exist needs further investigation
(Figure 7E).
(iv) G4 DNA may regulate nucleosome organization
(Figure 7F). Nucleosome density and organization
is an indicator of the chromatin state controlling the
accessibility of regulator proteins to their target
DNA (77). Nucleosome occupancy is a general
mechanism for gene regulation since the function
of many regulatory elements relies on binding of
cognate proteins. A recent study showed that the
frequency of PG4Ms is negatively correlated with
nucleosome occupancy near the TSS in yeast,
suggesting that PG4M is an anti-nucleosomal
motif, although the underlying mechanism is
unclear (30). It has been recognized that DNA
sequence could potentially inﬂuence the architecture
of the nucleosome (78–81). It is highly possible that
formation of G4 DNA in PG4Ms could aﬀect
nucleosome architecture of the host GREs and, in
turn, control their regulatory function. Two
potential mechanisms might be involved (Figure
7F): a) the formation of G4 DNA could impede
DNA wrapping around the histone octamer to
form the nucleosome; b) G4 DNA can recruit
chromatin remodelers which then exclude the
histones from DNA. The observation that PG4Ms
are negatively correlated with nucleosome
occupancy at the TPR is reminiscent of our recent
ﬁnding that PG4Ms located in the immediate
downstream region of the TSS positively correlated
with the gene expression level (29). We proposed
previously that PG4Ms stimulate gene transcription
through a DNA structural-mediated mechanism. It
is also possible that formation of G4 DNA can
block rehybridization with the complementary
strand, hence inﬂuencing nucleosome assembly in
the TPR and making the chromatin remain in an
open state for high-rate transcription.

With all of our ﬁndings considered herein, we hypo-
thesize that the G4 motifs are ‘colonized’ in regulatory
elements as structure-based regulatory apparatus for
gene regulation. The transition of DNA structure
(spontaneously or with the help of G4-promoting or
stabilizing proteins) may mediate the gene regulation
process. While the regulatory roles of DNA sequence
motifs/elements and epigenetic regulators have been
extensively studied recently, the role of DNA secondary
structures remains largely unknown in this context. Our
ﬁndings highlight that G4 DNA structural motifs would
provide regulatory signals for genome-wide gene
regulation and suggest that DNA structure-mediated
gene regulation might be a common strategy in the
human genome. There are still outlying and unknown
concerns, since the correlation coeﬃcient between
PG4Ms and genes only decreased from 0.589 to 0.488
when masking all PG4Ms in GREs. Our results, thus,
indicate that a) PG4Ms are enriched in many other
GREs that were not included in the seven representative
types of GREs analyzed and b) PG4Ms may have other
roles involving the gene body and gene proximal regions.
Consistent with this idea, a recent study reported that
PG4Ms are over-represented in the 30-end of genes
and suggested that G4 DNA would be involved in
transcription termination (82). We are just beginning to
understand the mystery of the role of G4 DNA.
