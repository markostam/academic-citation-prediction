ABSTRACT
Dlx2, Lymphoid Enhancer Factor (Lef-1) and Msx2
transcription factors are required for several devel-
opmental processes. To understand the control
of gene expression by these factors, chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays identified Msx2
as a downstream target of Dlx2 and Lef-1. Dlx2
activates the Msx2 promoter in several cell lines
and binds DNA as a monomer and dimer. A Lef-1 b-
catenin-dependent isoform minimally activates the
Msx2 promoter and a Lef-1 b-catenin-independent
isoform is inactive, however co-expression of Dlx2
and both Lef-1 isoforms synergistically activate
the Msx2 promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation and
protein pull-down experiments demonstrate Lef-1
physically interacts with Dlx2. Deletion analyses of
the Lef-1 protein reveal specific regions required for
synergism with Dlx2. The Lef-1 b-catenin binding
domain (bDB) is not required for its interaction with
Dlx2. Msx2 can auto-regulate its promoter and
repress Dlx2 activation. Msx2 repression of Dlx2
activation is dose-specific and both bind a common
DNA-binding element. These transcriptional mecha-
nisms correlate with the temporal and spatial
expression of these factors and may provide a
mechanism for the control of several developmental
processes. We demonstrate new transcriptional
activities for Dlx2, Msx2 and Lef-1 through protein
interactions and identification of downstream
targets.
INTRODUCTION
The vertebrate Msx genes originally cloned from mice, are
homologous to the Drosophila muscle segment homeobox
gene (msh) (1,2). There are three unlinked mammalian Msx
gene family members consisting of Msx1, Msx2 and Msx3
(3,4). Msx3 has a restricted expression pattern and is seen
only in the dorsal neural tube (5,6). However, Msx1 and
Msx2 are expressed in many organs and strongly expressed
in developing craniofacial regions (7–9). Msx2 is expressed
in epithelial-mesenchymal tissue interactions of several
organs including teeth (8,10). Unlike Msx1, which is confined
to the mesenchyme throughout tooth development, Msx2
expression is observed in the epithelial and mesenchymal
regions of the developing tooth germs. Msx2 mutations
are associated with tooth defects and Msx2 deficient mice
demonstrate developmental defects in ectodermal organs
(11). Consistent with Msx2 expression occurring after the
early expression of Pitx2, Lef-1 and Dlx2 in the dental epithe-
lium, Msx2 mutant mice teeth develop normally through the
early stages of development but have defects associated with
late tooth morphogenesis and amelogenesis (8,12–16).
Msx2 homeobox gene expression can be observed in
the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and other regions of the
developing limb (8,10). The expression of the chick Msx2
gene in the AER and other regions of the developing limb
is dependent on multiple closely spaced regulatory elements
(17). Interestingly, Msx2 and Dlx genes have highly localized
expression patterns in the AER (18,19).
Dlx2, a member of the distal-less gene family, has been
established as a regulator of branchial arch development
(20,21). Homozygous mutants of Dlx2 have abnormal devel-
opment of forebrain cells and craniofacial abnormalities in
developing neural tissue (22). Dlx2 can regulate Dlx5 and/
or Dlx6 expression and ectopic expression of Dlx2 induced
Dlx5 expression in slice cultures of the mouse embryonic
cerebral cortex (23,24). Furthermore, ectopic expression of
Dlx2 can induce the expression of glutamic acid decarboxy-
lase in brain slices (24). Analyses of the Dlx1/2 mutant mice
demonstrate a decrease in expression of Aristaless, which
may control the development of GABAergic neurons (25).
Dlx2 is also expressed in the first branchial arch and
is involved in tooth development (21,26). Dlx genes are
believed to play a role in tooth morphogenesis because homo-
zygous Dlx1/Dlx2 mutants are missing maxillary molars (27).
The overlapping expression patterns of Msx and Dlx genes in
the branchial arches, AER, teeth and brain suggest an interac-
tive role for these transcription factors (18,19,22).
Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (Lef-1) is a cell
type-specific transcription factor expressed in lymphocytes
of the adult mouse and in the neural crest, mesencephalon,

tooth germs, whisker follicles and other sites during embryo-
genesis (13,28–32). Lef-1 is a member of the high mobility
group (HMG) family of proteins and activates transcription
only in collaboration with other DNA-binding proteins and
may promote the assembly of a higher-order nucleoprotein
complex by juxtaposing non-adjacent factor binding sites
(33–35). Lef-1 expression overlaps that of Dlx2 and Msx2
in the dental epithelium, branchial arches and limb buds
(13,31,36).
Msx2 expression is detected in tissues specific for Dlx2
and Lef-1 expression, which suggests that they functionally
interact or regulate the expression of each other. The coor-
dinated expression of genes during development is not
regulated by one molecule or transcription factor but by
several factors acting together through direct physical contact
or through independent DNA-binding to their respective
DNA elements. Thus, individual genes are regulated by
complexes of factors interacting with regulatory elements
consisting of multiple binding sites. This regulatory network
provides a mechanism for the temporal and spatial control
of gene expression that is absolutely required for embryo
development.
We use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to
identify downstream targets of transcription factors involved
in embryogenesis and tooth development. The ChIP assay
identified Dlx2 binding to the Msx2 promoter in two different
cell lines expressing Dlx2 and we confirmed this binding by
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and transient
transfection of Msx2 promoter constructs and expression con-
structs. New transcriptional mechanisms are demonstrated
through direct protein interactions between Dlx2 and Lef-1
in the activation of Msx2 promoter activity. ChIP assays
also revealed Lef-1 binding to the Msx2 promoter. Structure
and function analyses demonstrate specific interactions
between Dlx2 and Lef-1. Deletion analyses of the Lef-1 pro-
tein demonstrate that the b-catenin binding region is not
required for its interaction with Dlx2 or synergistic activation
of the Msx2 promoter. Thus, Dlx2 is a new partner for Lef-1
and appears to be independent of b-catenin. However, two
regions of Lef-1 have been identified that interact with
Dlx2. Furthermore, Msx2 can auto-regulate its promoter
and Msx2 can attenuate Dlx2 activation. Our research demon-
strates a functional interaction between Dlx2 and Lef-1 in
regulating gene expression and provides a new role for Lef-1.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Complementary oligonucleotides containing a Dlx2 binding
site within the Msx2 promoter with flanking partial BamHI
ends were annealed and filled with Klenow polymerase
to generate 32P-labeled probes for EMSAs, as described
(37). The sense primer was 50-GATCCGGGTAGAGATTA-
GTTGAATATCCCTTGGG-30 and the anti-sense primer
was 50-GATCCCCAAGGGATATTCAACTAATCTCTACC-
CG-30 with the Dlx2 binding site underlined. The Dlx2
binding site selected for the EMSA is located at 260 to
265 (50-TAGTTG-30) of the Msx2 promoter. Standard
binding assays were performed as previously described
(38). A titration of the bacteria expressed and purified Dlx2
and Msx2 proteins were used in the assays. The samples
were electrophoresed, visualized and quantitated as described
previously, except quantitation of dried gels was performed
on the Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphoImager (37).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
The ChIP analysis was performed as described using the
ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate) with the following modifications.
CHO and LS-8 cells were fed for 24 h, harvested and plated
in 60 mm dishes. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formalde-
hyde for 10 m at 37C the next day. The cells were washed
with cold phosphate-buffered saline with mammalian pro-
tease inhibitor cocktail (SIGMA) and lysed in 200 ml SDS
lysis buffer for 10 m on ice and sonicated three times for
10 s. The average DNA fragments ranged between 200
and 2000 bp. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation
at 13 000 r.p.m. for 10 m at 4C and diluted 10-fold in ChIP
dilution buffer. The sonicated samples were precleared using
Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A Agarose-50% Slurry for 1 h at
4C and 1% cell lysate was used for input control. Samples
were incubated with Dlx2 goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or Lef-1 mouse monoclonal IgG (Upstate),
overnight at 4C. Immune complexes were washed consecu-
tively for 5 m with each of the following solutions: Low salt
immune complex wash buffer, High salt immune complex
wash buffer, LiCl immune complex wash buffer and TE
buffer twice. Complexes were then eluted twice at room tem-
perature for 15 m in elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3).
Immunoprecipitated DNA was reverse cross-linked at 65C
for 4 h in 200 mM NaCl and phenol/chloroform purified.
An aliquot of the immunoprecipitated DNA (5 ml) from
non-transfected cells was used for PCR (40 cycles). All reac-
tions were done under an annealing temperature of 57C.
Two primers for amplifying the Dlx2 and Lef-1 binding
sites in the Msx2 promoter are as follows: sense- 50-AAGGG-
AGAAAGGGTAGAG-30 and antisense, 50-CCCGCCTGAG-
AATGTTGG-30. All the PCR products were evaluated on a
1% agarose gel in 1· TBE for appropriate size (272 bp)
and confirmed by sequencing. As controls the Msx2 primers
were used without chromatin, normal rabbit IgG was used
replacing the Dlx2 or Lef-1 antibody to reveal non-specific
immunoprecipitation of the chromatin and primers to an unre-
lated gene were used to demonstrate the specificity of the
immunoprecipitated chromatin.
Expression and promoter constructs
Expression plasmids containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV)
promoter linked to the Msx2 and Lef-1 cDNA were
constructed in pcDNA 3.1 MycHisC (Invitrogen) (37–39).
The Lef-1 deletion constructs were prepared by PCR ampli-
fication of the full-length Lef-1 cDNA and cloned into the
pcDNA3.1 MycHisC vector. The full-length Lef-1 cDNA
was PCR amplified using a sense primer containing the
Kozak sequence, initiation codon and an XbaI site and an
anti-sense primer without the terminator codon containing a
KpnI site. This clone is 1193 bp, encodes a protein of 397
residues and includes the b-catenin binding domain (bBD)
in the N-terminus. The Lef-1 DN113 construct represents a
smaller alternative Lef-1 transcript found in tissues and was

cloned using a sense primer containing a kozak sequence,
initiation codon and a NotI site. The anti-sense primer
contained a HindIII site without the terminator codon is
854 bp and encodes a protein of 284 amino acids. This
clone does not include the bBD in the N-terminus. The
Lef-1 DN295 construct was PCR amplified using a NotI
sense primer and a HindIII anti-sense primer; the product
was 306 bp and 102 amino acids. It contains the HMG
domain. The Lef-1 DN363 construct was made using a
sense primer containing a BamHI site and HindIII anti-
sense primer, is 102 bp and encodes a C-terminal peptide
of 34 residues. Lef-1 DN113-DC34 was made using a NotI
sense primer and HindIII anti-sense primer and contains
the CAD and HMG domains but not the bBD. It is 752 bp
and encodes a protein of 250 residues. Lef-1 DN113-DC102
was made using a BamHI sense primer and HindIII anti-
sense primer and includes only the CAD domain. It is
546 bp and encodes a 182 amino acid protein. All PCR
products were digested with the appropriate restriction
enzymes and inserted into the digested vector.
The Dlx2 expression plasmid has been previously
described (kindly provided by Dr John Rubenstein, Univer-
sity of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA). The
Msx2 promoter construct (kindly provided by Dr Y. Chen,
Tulane University, New Orleans, LA) was digested with
XhoI and NotI to isolate a 5.8 kB fragment, which was
ligated into the luciferase vector [previously described (38)]
using BamHI/XhoI and NotI/HindIII linkers. This created
the Msx2-5820 luciferase reporter construct. The Msx2-872
construct was made by digesting Msx2-5820 with BamHI
and HindIII and the resulting 872 bp fragment was ligated
into the luciferase vector. The Msx2-238 construct was
made by PCR using primers containing BamHI and HindIII
sites. PCR products were TAE gel purified if necessary. All
PCR products were ligated into the vector using the Rapid
DNA ligation kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) and then transformed into DH5a competent cells
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All constructs were
confirmed by DNA sequencing. All plasmids were purified
by CsCl gradient centrifugation for use in the transfection
assays. A CMV or SV-40 b-galactosidase reporter plasmid
(Clontech) was also purified for co-transfection in all
experiments as a control for transfection efficiency.
Cell culture, transient transfections, luciferase and
b-galactosidase assays
CHO, C3H10T1/2 and LS-8 cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 5% or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and penicillin/streptomycin and transfected by electropora-
tion. Cultures were fed 24 h prior to transfection, resuspended
in PBS and mixed with 2.5 mg of expression plasmids, 5 mg
of reporter plasmid and 0.5 mg of CMV or SV-40
b-galactosidase plasmid. Electroporation of CHO cells was
performed at 360 V and 950 microfarads (mF) (Gene Pulser
XL, Bio-Rad) and C3H10T1/2 cells at 340 V and 950 mF.
LS-8 cells were transfected by electroporation as previously
described (37). Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h
in 60 mm culture dishes and fed with 5% FBS and
DMEM and then lysed and assayed for reporter activities
and protein content by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase
was measured using reagents from Promega. b-Galactosidase
was measured using the Galacto-Light Plus reagents
(Tropix Inc.). All luciferase activities were normalized to
b-galactosidase activity.
Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins
Lef-1 and Msx2 were PCR amplified from cDNA clones
as described and ligated into the pGex6P-2 GST vector
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) (37–39).
Dlx2 was PCR amplified and cloned into the pGex6P-2
GST vector using BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme sites
engineered into the primers. Lef-1 and Lef-1 deletion frag-
ments were PCR amplified using primers with specific
restriction endonuclease sites, digested and cloned into the
GST digested vector. All pGex6P-2 GST plasmids were con-
firmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transformed
into BL21 cells. Proteins were isolated as described (40,41).
Proteins were cleaved from the GST moiety using 80 U
of PreScission Protease (Pharmacia Biotech) per ml of
glutathione Sepharose. Cleaved proteins were stored in 10%
glycerol. Protein concentration was quantitated with Bradford
Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Proteins
were examined by electrophoresis on denaturing SDS–
polyacrylamide gels, followed by Coomassie Blue staining
(50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and 0.5% coomassie brilliant
blue stain).
GST pull-down assays
Immobilized GST-Dlx2, GST-PITX2 and GST-Lef-1 fusion
proteins were prepared as described above and suspended
in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% glycerol,
50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, with or without
1% milk and 400 mg/ml of ethidium bromide). Purified
bacteria expressed Lef-1 proteins (50–200 ng’s) were added
to 5 mg’s immobilized GST–Dlx2 fusion proteins or GST in
a total volume of 100 ml and incubated for 30 m at 4C. The
beads were pelleted and washed 4 times with 200 ml binding
buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-
sample buffer and separated on a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide
gel. Approximately, 80 ng of purified Lef-1 proteins were
analyzed in separate western blots. Following SDS gel elec-
trophoresis, the proteins were transferred to PVDF filters
(Millipore), immunoblotted and detected using appropriate
antibodies, Lef-1, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Upstate),
Dlx2 goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
ECL reagents from Amersham.
Immunoprecipitation assay
Approximately 24 h after cell transfection with Dlx2 and
Lef-1 DN113, CHO cells were rinsed with 1 ml of PBS,
then incubated with 1 ml ice cold RIPA buffer for 15 m at
4C. Cells were harvested and disrupted by repeated aspira-
tion through a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1 ml syringe.
The lysates were then incubated on ice for 30 m. Cellular
debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000· g for 10 m
at 4C. An aliquot of lysate was saved for analysis as input
control. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml
microfuge tube on ice and precleared using the Preclearing
Matrix B-goat (ExactaCruz B, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
for 30 m at 4C. Matrix was removed by brief centrifugation

and supernatant transferred to a new tube. An IP antibody-IP
matrix complex was prepared as per manufacturer’s instruc-
tions using primary anti-Dlx2 (25 ml) antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The IP antibody-IP matrix complex was
incubated with the precleared cell lysate at 4C for 12 h.
After incubation the lysate was centrifuged to pellet the IP
matrix. The matrix was washed three times with PBS and
resuspended in 15 ml of ddH2O and 3 ml 6· SDS loading
dye. Samples were boiled for 5 m and resolved on a 10%
polyacylamide gel. A western blot assay was used with
anti-Lef-1 antibody and HRP conjugated ExactaCruz reagent
to detect immunoprecipitated proteins.
RESULTS
Dlx2 binds to the Msx2 promoter and is co-expressed
with Msx2 in several cell lines
The 5.8 Kb Msx2 promoter contains multiple Dlx2 binding
sites. To demonstrate Dlx2 binding to these sites, an EMSA
was performed using purified Dlx2 protein and a probe
derived from the Msx2 promoter containing a Dlx2 binding
site, 260 to 265 bp (TAGTTG). Dlx2 protein was added
to the probe at 60, 120 and 180 ng and two bands were
detected that were not in the probe alone lane (Figure 1A).
These bands increased in intensity with increasing Dlx2
protein and the slower migrating band appears to be a homo-
dimer of Dlx2. Specificity of the complexes was demon-
strated using 50-fold excess cold competitor probe
(Figure 1A). Specificity of Dlx2 binding was further demon-
strated using Dlx2 antisera and 180 ng of Dlx2 protein. The
antisera reduced Dlx2 binding to the probe and both
band intensities were decreased (Figure 1B). To determine
if Msx2 and Dlx2 compete for binding to the probe, 180 ng
of Dlx2 was incubated with 120 and 180 ng of Msx2.
Msx2 bound as three bands, which increase in intensity
with increasing amounts of protein (Figure 1B). Interestingly,
the binding of both Dlx2 and Msx2 decreased when both
proteins were present in the binding reaction, demonstrating
a competition for the DNA-binding site (Figure 1B). The
pure Msx2 protein used in the binding studies is shown in
Figure 2B. The pure Dlx2 protein used in the EMSA experi-
ment is shown in Figure 2A identified with the Dlx2 Ab on a
western blot. Endogenous Dlx2 was observed in the tooth
epithelial cell line LS-8, the pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cell
line and the CHO cell line (Figure 2A). Dlx2 appears to be
highly expressed in CHO cells but is also seen in the other
two cell lines. We next determined if Msx2 was expressed
in these cell lines and found similar levels of endogenous
Msx2 expression in the three cell lines (Figure 2B). Lef-1
expression was observed in all three cell lysates, however
only LS-8 and 10T1/2 cells express the larger molecular
weight isoforms (Figure 2C).
ChIP analyses were done to demonstrate Dlx2 binding to
the Msx2 promoter in the cell chromatin because these
three cell lines endogenously express Dlx2 and Msx2. A
sense primer and an anti-sense primer, which flank the
Dlx2 binding site located at 260 to 265 in the Msx2
promoter, were designed and produce a 272 bp product
(Figure 3A). The sense primer anneals to the sequence
located at 268 to 285 and the anitsense primer at 13
to 29 of the Msx2 promoter (Figure 3A). The Dlx2 binding
Figure 1. Dlx2 binds to an element in the Msx2 Promoter. (A) Dlx2 proteins (60, 120 and 180 ngs) were incubated with the Msx2 promoter sequence containing a
Dlx2 binding element (TAGTTG) as the radioactive probe. The 50· comp. lane was performed with 180 ngs of Dlx2 protein and 50-fold excess of cold
competitor probe. (B) Dlx2 protein (180 ng) was incubated with 2 ml of Dlx2 Ab, which decreased Dlx2 binding demonstrating the specificity of Dlx2. Msx2
protein at 60, 120 and 180 ng bound the Msx2 probe as three distinct bands. Msx2 titration (120 and 180 ng) with 180 ng Dlx2 revealed competitive binding for
the same element by these proteins. The EMSA experiments were analyzed in 8% native polyacrylamide gels. The free and bound forms of DNA were
quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphoImager. The free probe, bound and dimer complexes are indicated.

site selected for the ChIP assay is identical to the EMSA
probe sequence (Figure 1A). Chromatin isolated from cells
prior to immunoprecipitation served as a control; a sample
without treatment of Dlx2 antibody was used as input control
template and the primers were used to demonstrate the pres-
ence of chromatin in the sample. The primer set amplified the
Msx2 promoter from chromatin input derived from the CHO
cell line (lane 4, Figure 3B). A PCR was performed without
chromatin and primers only as a negative control (lane 3,
Figure 3B). Endogenous Dlx2 is bound to the Msx2 promoter
in vivo as shown using Dlx2 antibody and Msx2 primers
(lane 2, Figure 3B). Normal rabbit IgG was used as a control
and did not immunoprecipitate the Msx2 promoter (lane 5,
Figure 3B). Furthermore, using primers to an unrelated
gene did not amplify a product from the Dlx2 antibody
immunoprecipitated chromatin (lane 6, Figure 3B). Lane 1
contains 1 Kb ladder (Promega) to confirm sizes of the
PCR products (Figure 3B). All PCR products were sequenced
to confirm their identity.
The tooth epithelial LS-8 cell ChIP assay was also perfor-
med to demonstrate endogenous Dlx2 binding to the Msx2
promoter in these cells. The ChIP results with LS-8 and
CHO cells were identical. The results reveal in vivo binding
of Dlx2 to the Msx2 promoter in CHO cells (lane 2,
Figure 3C). The appropriate controls were performed as in
Figure 3B.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal Lef-1
binding to the Msx2 promoter
Sequence analysis of the Msx2 promoter revealed a Lef-1
binding site (CTTTGTC) at 220 to 226 (Figure 4A).
Because Lef-1 is endogenously expressed in many cell
lines, the ChIP assay was used to determine if Lef-1 bound
to the Msx2 promoter. Lef-1 is endogenously expressed in
the LS-8 cell line and the Lef-1 Ab immunoprecipitates the
Lef-1/chromatin complex containing the Msx2 promoter
(lane 2, Figure 4B). The control lanes are identical to
Figure 3.
Dlx2 and Lef-1 synergistically activate the
Msx2 promoter
Dlx2 activation of Msx2 was demonstrated using three pro-
moter constructs linked to the luciferase gene (Figure 5A).
The Msx2-5820 Luc promoter contains 5.8 Kb of the Msx2
promoter and has 12 consensus (TAATTA) and non-
consensus Dlx2 binding sites (TAGTTG, TATTTG). Two
truncated Msx2 promoters were constructed; Msx2-872 Luc
contains 872 bp of the Msx2 promoter and three Dlx2 binding
sites and Msx2-238 Luc, which does not contain Dlx2
binding sites (Figure 5A). Dlx2 activated the full-length
Msx2 promoter at 20-fold in CHO cells (Figure 5B).
Interestingly, Dlx2 activated the truncated Msx2-872
promoter at higher levels (30-fold) compared to the full-
length promoter (Figure 5B). These results may indicate the
presence of other factors binding to upstream Msx2 promoter
sequences that attenuate Dlx2 activation. However, Dlx2 did
not activate the minimal Msx2-238 promoter (Figure 5B).
Because Lef-1 is co-expressed with Dlx2 and Msx2 in several
tissues, we asked if Lef-1 could activate the Msx2 promoter.
In these experiments we used the alternatively spliced Lef-1
DN113 construct, which does not contain the bBD in its
N-terminus. This naturally occurring Lef-1 transcript was
used in order to eliminate the effect of b-catenin activating
Lef-1. Lef-1 DN113 alone did not activate the Msx2 promo-
ters however, co-transfection with Dlx2 resulted in a 33-fold
synergistic activation of the Msx2-5820 promoter and 62-fold
activation of the Msx2-872 promoter (Figure 5B). The Msx2-
238 minimal promoter was activated at 5-fold by Dlx2 and
Lef-1 DN113, due to the presence of the Lef-1 binding site in
this promoter construct. There is no difference in the syner-
gistic activation of the Msx2 promoter between the Lef-1
DN113 or Lef-1 FL (full length) constructs (see Figure 8).

These experiments were repeated in the pluripotent
C3H10T1/2 embryonic cell line. Transfection of these cells
with the same constructs reveal similar results as with the
CHO cells indicating activity in CHO cells was not cell spe-
cific (Figure 5C). Dlx2 activation and synergism with Lef-1
DN113 was similar to that observed in CHO cells. The com-
bination of this data and the ChIP assay demonstrate specific
regulation of the Msx2 promoter by Dlx2 and a synergy
between Dlx2 and Lef-1. Furthermore, these experiments
were performed in the LS-8 tooth epithelial cell line. The
activation levels were decreased however, the relative activa-
tion of the Msx2 promoter by Dlx2 and Lef-1 were similar
(Figure 11B).
Dlx2 and Lef-1 physically interact
The finding that Lef-1 DN113 alone did not activate the Msx2
promoter but synergized with Dlx2 suggested a physical
interaction between Dlx2 and Lef-1 independent of b-catenin.
A GST-pull-down assay was performed using immobilized
GST-Dlx2 on Sepharose beads and incubated with pure
Lef-1 DN113 protein under stringent binding conditions. As
a control, GST-beads alone did not bind Lef-1 DN113, how-
ever, Lef-1 DN113 bound to GST-Dlx2 demonstrating a
direct protein interaction between these two proteins
(Figure 6). Previously shown to interact with Lef-1, immo-
bilized GST-PITX2 was used as a positive control (39)
(Figure 6). Lef-1 binds to both proteins at similar levels.
The binding of Lef-1 DN113, a smaller native transcript,
indicates that its interaction with Dlx2 does not require the
bDB or the N-terminus.
Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate Dlx2 and
Lef-1 protein interactions. CHO cells co-transfected with
Dlx2 and Lef-1 DN113 were assayed using the Dlx2 antibody
to immunoprecipitate a Dlx2/Lef-1 complex. The immuno-
precipitation experiments reveal a Dlx2 interaction with
Lef-1 DN113 (lane 1, Figure 7). Because CHO cells do not
express the larger molecular weight Lef-1 proteins but do
express Dlx2 (Figure 2A), a small amount of Lef-1 DN113
is immunoprecipitated in the Lef-1 only transfected cells
(Figure 7, lane 2). As controls, empty vector and Dlx2
transfection did not immunoprecipitate Lef-1. Lef-1 DN113
expression is shown in transfected CHO cell lysates (10%
input) and also seen when co-transfected with Dlx2
(Figure 7, lanes 8 and 9). Mock and Dlx2 input lanes were
used as controls with the Lef-1 antibody.
The Lef-1 CAD domain and 30 flanking residues are
required for synergism with Dlx2
We have shown that an alternative endogenous Lef-1 tran-
script (Lef-1 DN113) containing the context-dependent
activation domain (CAD) and HMG domain while lacking
the bBD interacts with Dlx2 and synergistically activates
the Msx2 promoter (Figure 5B and C and Figure 8B and
C). In CHO cells, Lef-1 DN113 co-transfected with Dlx2
synergistically activates the Msx2-5820 full-length promoter
at 40-fold (Figure 8B). The full-length Lef-1 cDNA
containing the bBD activated the Msx2 promoter at 6-fold
and co-expression of Dlx2 synergistically activated the
Msx2 promoter at 40-fold in CHO cells (Figure 8B). Similar
activation was observed in C3H10T1/2 cells (Figure 8C).
Thus, the bBD is not required for the Lef-1 synergistic activa-
tion with Dlx2. Deletion of 295 residues from the Lef-1 N-
terminus (Lef-1 DN295), which removes the CAD domain
and leaves most of the HMG domain intact, results in a
loss of synergism in CHO cells (Figure 8B) and C3H10T1/
2 cells (Figure 8C). These results suggest that the HMG
domain alone is not sufficient for synergistic activation of
the Msx2 promoter with Dlx2. Further truncation of the
Lef-1 N-terminus deleting most of the HMG domain (Lef-1
DN363) resulted in a loss of synergism (Figure 8B and C).
These results demonstrate that the CAD domain is required
for Lef-1 activation and/or synergism with Dlx2. In contrast,
deleting part or most of the HMG domain, Lef-1 DC34 or

control GST-beads were incubated with purified Lef-1 to demonstrate the
specificity of Lef-1 binding to the fusion proteins. As a positive control Lef-1
was incubated with GST-PITX2, which has previously been shown to bind
Lef-1 (39). Lef-1 binds to immobilized GST-Dlx2 demonstrating that Lef-1
can physically interact with Dlx2. The bound protein was detected by western
blot using the Lef-1 antibody. Lef-1 binds equally to both proteins. Three
independent experiments were performed.

expression plasmids (2.5 mg) were transfected into CHO cells and incubated
for 24 h. Cells were harvested and lysed and the Lef-1/Dlx2 protein complex
immunoprecipitated (IP) using the Dlx2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated
complexes were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a
PVDF filter and western blotting was done using the Lef-1 antibody. Lane 1
is the Lef-1 DN113 and Dlx2 co-transfected IP, lane 2 is the Lef-1 DN113
transfected IP, lane 3 is the Dlx2 transfected IP, lane 4 is the mock-transfected
cell lysate IP. Input controls are shown in lanes 6–9. As a molecular weight
size control, 150 ng of purified Lef-1 protein was immunoblotted (lane 5).
The transfected Lef-1 migrates slightly slower due to the presence of a C-
terminal Myc/His tag on the mammalian expression plasmids. Transfected
Dlx2 is expressed in CHO cells and a representative lysate is shown in
Figure 9C. Molecular weight markers are shown between lanes 4 and 5.
Experiments were repeated more than three times.

Lef-1 DC102 results in low activity alone (3-fold) and
synergism with Dlx2 in both cell types (Figure 8B and C).
The Lef-1 DC34 and Lef-1 DC102 constructs contain the
CAD domain including 70 residues between the CAD and
HMG domains (Figure 8A) that are necessary for synergism
with Dlx2.
Dlx2 interacts with the CAD and
HMG domains of Lef-1
To determine specific regions of Lef-1 that interact with
Dlx2, GST-pull-down experiments were performed using
immobilized Lef-1 deletion constructs and purified Dlx2
protein. The Lef-1 constructs are identical to those used in
the transfection experiments (Figure 8A). We have previously
shown that the naturally occurring smaller Lef-1 protein,
Lef-1 DN113 is sufficient for binding Dlx2 (Figure 6).
Interestingly, Dlx2 can directly interact with the HMG
domain and the C-terminal portion of the HMG domain,
GST-Lef-1 DN295 and GST-Lef-1 DN363, respectively
(Figure 9B). There is no reduction in binding compared to
the GST-Lef-1 DN113 construct of these two N-terminal
deletion mutants (Figure 9B). We were surprised to observe
Dlx2 binding to Lef-1 DN363, as this is only a 34 amino
acid peptide; however Dlx2 binding to this construct was
observed in repeated experiments and at similar levels
compared to wild type Lef-1. We term this C-terminal Dlx2
interaction region as Dlx2 binding domain (BD) #2. Deletion
of the Lef-1 C-terminal region, which lacks the 34 amino acid
sequence (GST-Lef-1 DC34) and GST-Lef-1 DC102, which
lacks most of the HMG domain, bind Dlx2 at levels similar
to wild type Lef-1 DN113 (Figure 9C). These data suggest
that Dlx2 can bind to the CAD domain and/or the 70 residues
that flank the CAD domain, termed Dlx2 BD #1. GST-beads
do not bind Dlx2 as a control. Thus, Dlx2 may bind to several
regions on Lef-1 or contact several residues of each region
simultaneously. Further experiments will determine the
exact binding sites and residues involved in the binding of
each protein.
Msx2 auto-regulation and attenuation of
Dlx2 activation
Because the DNA-binding elements of Dlx2 and Msx2
are similar, we asked if Msx2 could regulate its promoter.
Transfection of Msx2 in CHO cells resulted in a 3- to
4-fold repression of both the Msx2-5820 and Msx2-872
promoters (Figure 10A). These results demonstrate auto-
regulation by this well-known repressor protein. Msx2 and
Dlx2 directly interact to regulate their activities through pro-
tein interactions (18). However, they have not been shown to
functionally regulate the Msx2 promoter. Because Msx2 and
Dlx2 are co-expressed in similar tissues during development
as well as in the CHO cells, can they antagonize each other?
Equal expression of both factors revealed a decrease in Dlx2
activation of the full-length Msx2 promoter from 20- to 5-fold
(Figure 10A). Repression of Dlx2 activation was also
observed with the Msx2-872 promoter (Figure 10A). To
determine if these activities were cell dependent, trans-
fections were performed in C3H10T1/2 cells. No major
differences were observed between these two different cell
lines albeit a modest decrease in overall activation in
the C3H10T1/2 cell line compared to the CHO cells
(Figure 10B).
Msx2 repression of Dlx2 activation is dose-responsive
and independent of Lef-1. Msx2 plasmid was titrated in
CHO cells transfected with 2.5 mg of Dlx2 and Lef-1 FL or
Lef-1 DN113 (Figure 11A). The synergistic activation of
the Msx2 promoter by Dlx2 and Lef-1 FL was decreased
from 38-fold without Msx2 to 28-fold (1.25 mg Msx2),
17-fold (2.5 mg Msx2) and 9-fold (3.75 mg Msx2). Interest-
ingly, Msx2 repression of the synergistic activation by Dlx2

and the shorter Lef-1 isoform (Lef-1 DN113) was increased
compared to Lef-1 FL (Figure 11A). Dlx2 and Lef-1
DN113 synergistically activate the Msx2 promoter at 38-
fold; addition of 1.25 mg Msx2 repressed the activation to
13-fold, 2.5 mg Msx2 to 6-fold and 3.75 mg Msx2 to 5-fold
in CHO cells (Figure 11A. The same experiment was
repeated in the LS-8 tooth epithelial cell line. These cells
demonstrate the synergistic activation of the Msx2 promoter
by Dlx2 and Lef-1 FL or Lef-1 DN113 (Figure 11B). Msx2
represses the Msx2 promoter 3-fold as shown in CHO
cells. Furthermore, a similar decrease in synergistic activation
by Dlx2 and Lef-1 in LS-8 cells was observed by Msx2
titration as shown in CHO cells (Figure 11B). Together
these data demonstrate that Msx2 can negatively auto-
regulate its promoter and repress Dlx2 activation through
direct binding to a common site or a physical interaction
between the two proteins.
DISCUSSION
Several factors and molecules regulating Msx2 expression
have been identified including signaling molecules, hormones
and transcription factors. The FGF and BMP signaling
molecules are involved in the differential regulation of Msx
genes (42–45). BMP-dependent activation of Msx2 can be
mediated through the cooperative binding of Smad4 and
Lef-1; Lef-1 can synergize with Smad4 and Smad1 to activate
the Msx2 promoter (46). Furthermore, Lef-1 synergizes with
BMP2 to activate Msx2 expression. In contrast, YY1, a zinc
finger transcription factor, can activate Msx2 independent of
BMP signaling (47). Interestingly, glucocorticoid treatment
can increase Msx2 transcripts and protein both in vitro and
in vivo in embryonic mouse submandibular glands (48).
Pax3 has been shown to bind to the Msx2 promoter and
represses Msx2 expression in the murine cardiac neural
crest (49). Genetic analysis suggests that Fox1 is required

for BMP-dependent activation of Msx2 in calvarial tissues
of mouse embryos (50). Recently, Dlx5 and Sox11 both
expressed in the AER, have been identified as possible regu-
lators of Msx2 gene expression (17). While BMP signaling
plays a major role in Msx2 expression patterns during tooth
development, little is known about the role and mechanisms
of transcription factors regulating Msx2 expression in the
developing tooth.
Dlx2 regulates the Msx2 promoter
ChIP assays identified Dlx2 binding to the Msx2 promoter
in vivo and co-transfection of Dlx2 with the Msx2 promoter
reveals a direct activation by Dlx2. This transcriptional
mechanism coincides with the distinct expression pattern of
these two transcription factors during tooth development.
Dlx2 is expressed initially in both the dental mesenchyme
and epithelium and high expression is observed in the epithe-
lial tissue at later stages. Msx2 expression occurs 1 day after
Dlx2 expression in the epithelium, which would correspond
to its potential activation by Dlx2 in this tissue. There is
also overlapping expression patterns of Msx2 and Dlx2 in
the first two branchial arches and the AER where Msx2 and
Dlx2 overlap in the ectoderm (18).
Dlx2 binds to the Msx2 promoter as a monomer and pos-
sible homodimer as shown by the EMSA and correlates with
the homodimerization revealed in previous GST-pull-down
experiments (18). Furthermore, previous studies have shown
Dlx2 binding to the TAATTG sequence as multiple bands
suggesting the presence of dimers (22). There are approxi-
mately 12 Dlx2 binding sites in the Msx2 promoter including
the proximal site in which the ChIP assay revealed Dlx2 bind-
ing was a non-consensus 50-TAGTTG-30 compared to the
consensus 50-TAATTG-30 element. A previous report using
ChIP analyses has shown that the 50-TAATTA-30 sequence
was required for Dlx2 DNA-binding and activation in the
Dlx5/Dlx6 intergenic enhancer (23,51). A consensus site for
Xenopus Dlx3 was identified as (A/C/G)TAATT(G/A)(C/G)
(52). The core is a TAAT motif, which is observed in
many homeodomain DNA-binding proteins (53). However,
the 30 dinucleotide confers specificity to the binding of
these factors. Our data demonstrate that perturbations in the
core TAAT can be recognized by the Dlx2 homeodomain
protein and activate the Msx2 promoter. However, there is a
TAATCA sequence overlapping the TAGTTG element in the
anti-sense strand. It may be possible for Dlx2 to bind to this
region. Similarly, we have previously reported on the promis-
cuity of the Msx2 protein binding to non-consensus elements
and regulating promoter activity (37). Our results further
demonstrate the ability of Msx2 to bind to the non-consensus
TAGTTG element recognized by Dlx2 in the Msx2 promoter.
Dlx2 directly interacts with Lef-1 to regulate Msx2
The Lef-1 FL construct minimally activates the Msx2
promoter at 6-fold and the alternative Lef-1 transcript,
Lef-1 DN113 cannot activate the Msx2 promoter, however
both can complex with Dlx2 to synergistically activate Msx2.
We specifically utilized the smaller native Lef-1 transcript
(Lef-1 DN113) to dissociate the effects of b-catenin on Lef-1
interactions with Dlx2. Lef-1 transcripts can arise through
alternative splicing and different promoters (54–56). A recent
report describes the use of an internal ribosome entry site that
mediates the translation of a full-length Lef-1 transcript. The
full-length Lef-1 (Lef-1 FL) transcript contains a large 50UTR
synthesized using a separate PI promoter and utilizes a cap-
independent mechanism for translation of the full-length
Lef-1, containing the bBD (57). This isoform has been
termed growth promoting because it is expressed during
cell growth in undifferentiated, mitotically active cells. This
Lef-1 activity is countered by the expression of a truncated
Lef-1 protein that lacks the bBD and can compete for binding
to Wnt target genes. The shorter Lef-1 isoform is produced
from a second P2 promoter located in the second intron of
the LEF-1 locus (54,57). This shorter Lef-1 transcript
(Lef-1 DN113) could act as an inhibitory isoform due to its
ability to interact with co-factors interacting with Lef-1 FL
as well as compete for DNA-binding sites and thus been
termed growth suppressing. Interestingly, in colon cancer
cells only the LEF-1 FL transcript is produced and the loss
of balance between the long and short forms may effect
cancer progression (57).
It is well known that Lef-1 requires other factors to become
transcriptional active. In response to Wnt signals, b-catenin
is stabilized and interacts with the N-terminus of Lef-1 to
activate transcription of Wnt-responsive genes (58–60). A
previous report has demonstrated that Lef-1 can synergize
with Smad4 to activate the Msx2 promoter (46). This activa-
tion was independent of BMP signaling and was in response
to b-catenin activation. Recently, we demonstrated a role for
Lef-1, b-catenin and PITX2 in regulating the LEF-1 promoter
suggesting a role for b-catenin in regulating Dlx2 and Lef-1
regulation of the Msx2 promoter. Without Wnt signaling,
Lef-1 can interact with the co-repressor Groucho to repress
Wnt-responsive genes (61,62). We have previously identified
a Lef-1 interaction with the homeodomain transcription factor
PITX2 to synergistically regulate the LEF-1 promoter (39). In
this report we demonstrate that both the Lef-1 Fl and Lef-1
DN113 proteins can interact with Dlx2 and that the bBD
has no effect on this interaction. Thus, Dlx2 interaction
with Lef-1 and synergistic activation of the Msx2 promoter
is not limited to a specific Lef-1 isoform during development.
Lef-1 interaction domains
Several domains of Lef-1 have been identified that interact
with other factors. The Lef-1 amimo terminus contains the
b-catenin interaction domain (bBD) involved in Wnt signal-
ing (63). The CAD (33,34) and a region flanking the CAD are
required for association with the Groucho corepressor and
HDAC (64). The C-terminal HMG domain is involved in
DNA-binding (65) and two regions within the HMG domain
mediate the interaction with Smad factors (66). Two regions
of Lef-1 were found to interact with Smad3 in the HMG
domain. One site mapped to residues 324–334 while another
site was localized to a lysine- and arginine-rich region
between residues 370 and 383 (66). These two regions bind
to the MH2 and MH1 domains of Smad3, respectively. Our
data suggests two regions of Lef-1 interact with Dlx2; the
C-terminal region of the HMG domain containing 30 amino
acids (Lef-1 DN363), which corresponds to the Smad3
MH1 binding domain and a second region containing the
CAD and flanking sequences (Lef-1 DN113-DC102). These

regions may be involved in the interactions with other factors,
such as Smad3. Thus Dlx2 binding to Lef-1 could have an
impact on the overall activity of Lef-1 protein. Competition
between factors for these sites, could possibly add to the
complexity of Lef-1 transcriptional activity. We are currently
investigating the role of b-catenin in regulating the Dlx2/
Lef-1 transcription complex by fine mapping the interaction
sites.
An Msx2 feedback regulatory mechanism
Msx2 is a homeodomain transcription factor required for the
development of several tissues and processes (15). Msx2 is a
transcriptional repressor and can interact with other factors to
regulate transcription (18,67). These effects can occur
through their interactions with other factors without binding
to DNA (18,67–72).
Our data has shown that Msx2 can negatively regulate its
promoter. We have previously demonstrated Msx2 binding
to the TAATTG sequence with high affinity, which is shared
by Dlx2. However, Msx2 binding appears to be somewhat
promiscuous by binding to other homeodomain transcription
factor elements (37). We have previously reported that Msx2
and PITX2 can bind to the Dlx2 promoter bicoid elements
(consensus PITX2 binding elements) independent of one
another and the levels of binding are based on the relative
amount of each protein (37). In this report we demonstrate
that Msx2 competes with Dlx2 for binding to the TAGTTG
element in the Msx2 promoter. Msx2 bound to this element
as three bands, which is similar to Msx2 binding to the con-
sensus TAATTG element (37). Msx1 and Dlx2 demonstrate
mutual exclusive DNA-binding and we show that Msx2 com-
petes with Dlx2 for DNA-binding sites on the Msx2 promoter
in a similar fashion (18). Furthermore, Msx2 physically inter-
acts with Dlx2, which may inhibit Dlx2 transcriptional activ-
ity (18). Our data demonstrates a reduction in DNA-binding
by both Dlx2 and Msx2 when incubated together in the
EMSA experiment. This would be expected as both proteins
can directly interact and inhibit the DNA-binding activity of
the other protein (18). The activity of the Msx2 promoter
would be differentially regulated as the level of these two
proteins change during development. Such as during tooth
development, the level of Msx2 expression is initially high
immediately after Dlx2 and Lef-1 expression (cap stage),
restricted during the tooth bell stage, expressed at later stages
and during amelogenesis (8,16,73). Moreover, Msx and Dlx
proteins have been shown to bind identical elements on the
GnRH promoter resulting in functional antagonism (74);
Msx2 and Dlx5 on the osteocalcin promoter (75); and Pax3
and Msx1 on the MyoD promoter (76).
Based on the functional interaction between Dlx2 and
Lef-1, the identification that Dlx2 binds the Msx2 promoter
in vivo and the transcriptional activation of the Msx2 promoter
in three cell types, we propose a model for the regulation of
Msx2 by these factors (Figure 12). Furthermore, we have
demonstrated that Msx2 can negatively regulate its promoter
and attenuate the activation by Dlx2. Thus, Dlx2 and Lef-1
interact to synergistically activate Msx2; Msx2 can attenuate
Dlx2 activation or directly repress Msx2 promoter activity.
These interactions would regulate the spatial and temporal
expression pattern of Msx2 observed during development.
