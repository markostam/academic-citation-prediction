ABSTRACT
Visualization of site-specific labels in long linear or
circular DNA allows unambiguous identification of
various local DNA structures. Here we describe a
novel and efficient approach to site-specific DNA
labeling. The restriction enzyme SfiI binds to DNA
but leaves it intact in the presence of calcium and
therefore may serve as a protein label of 13 bp
recognition sites. Since SfiI requires simultaneous
interaction with two DNA recognition sites for stable
binding, this requirement is satisfied by providing
an isolated recognition site in the DNA target and
an additional short DNA duplex also containing the
recognition site. The SfiI/DNA complexes were
visualized with AFM and the specificity of the
labeling was confirmed by the length measure-
ments. Using this approach, two sites in plasmid
DNA were labeled in the presence of a large excess
of the helper duplex to compete with the formation
of looped structures of the intramolecular synaptic
complex. We show that the labeling procedure does
not interfere with the superhelical tension-driven
formation of alternative DNA structures such as
cruciforms. The complex is relatively stable at low
and high pH (pH 5 and 9) making the developed
approach attractive for use at conditions requiring
the pH change.
INTRODUCTION
Visualization of site-specific labels in long linear or circular
DNA allows unambiguous identification of various local
DNA structures, such as bent DNA (1–3), as well as the pro-
tein binding sites (4–6) at predicted distances from the labels.
The formation and stability of local structures, as well as pro-
tein functions, depend on the level of superhelical tension in
DNA, therefore there is a great demand for a simple labeling
procedure that does not change the DNA topology. Different
approaches have been proposed for the sequence-specific
DNA labeling. Some of them utilize the site-specific binding
of oligonucleotides (7–9) or PNA fragments (10–12). The
major drawbacks of these approaches are the complexity of
their designs and the involvement of multiple experimental
steps, and/or their dependence on DNA supercoiling. Restric-
tion enzymes and methylases rendered inactive by mutations
have been suggested for direct DNA labeling (13), however
moderate specific affinities of 107 to 109 M limit their
use for routine labeling. We have recently used AFM to
study very stable complexes of the restriction enzyme SfiI
with DNA which was kept undigested by replacing Mg2+
cations in the buffer with Ca2+ (14). SfiI binds as a tetramer
(total molecular weight of 124 kDa), which is easily identi-
fied in the AFM images. Thus, SfiI appears to be an excellent
candidate label of specific sites in circular DNA. However,
the requirement of two DNA recognition sites for the stable
complex formation complicates the use of SfiI for site-
specific labeling: (i) SfiI poorly binds to an isolated recogni-
tion site; (ii) SfiI binding to DNA molecules with more than
one recognition site results in DNA looping that changes the
overall DNA topology and therefore limits the propensity of
DNA molecules for intrinsic and protein-induced structural
rearrangements. Here we show that these complications can
be overcome by inducing stable SfiI binding to its target
site in DNA with the help of a short DNA duplex that pro-
vides the second SfiI recognition site. Using the oligonu-
cleotide duplex in excess to target DNA preferentially
drives the formation of an intermolecular (trans) synaptic
complexes which contain SfiI, long DNA molecule and the
oligonucleotide duplex, rather than the trans complex formed
by SfiI-mediated bridging of two recognition sites in two long
DNA fragments or an intramolecular or cis complex formed
by SfiI binding to the two recognition sites in the same circu-
lar molecule. This labeling procedure does not interfere with
cruciform formation and has very low dependence on the
DNA supercoiling. In addition, the complex dissociates
slowly in moderately acidic (pH 5) or alkaline (pH 9) media.

were determined by comparing the densitometric traces of a
Coomassie Blue-stained SDS–PAGE gel of SfiI and of refer-
ence quantities of BSA (15). The pUC8-derivative plasmids
pEO200, pEOF200 and pEOF250 were prepared as described
previously (14). Each plasmid contains two SfiI recognition
sites (SfiI recognition sequence is underlined): 50-GGCC-
ACCCCGGCC-30 and 50-GGCCTCGAGGGCC-30 (pEO200
and pEOF200) and 50-GGCCTTGTGGGCC-30 and 50-GGCC-
TCGAGGGCC-30 (pEOF250). The two sites are separated
by 200 bp of random sequence in plasmid pEO200 and by
300 bp in plasmid pEOF200. The latter plasmid contains a
106 bp inverted repeat F14C (16), centrally located between
the recognition sites. Plasmid pEOF250 also contains the
F14C inverted repeat asymmetrically located between the
SfiI sites that are 350 bp apart. Open circular DNA was
obtained by digestion of supercoiled plasmids with a nicking
enzyme Nt.BstNBI as recommended by the supplier. After
phenol–chloroform extraction, DNA was purified by ethanol
precipitation.
The 362 bp DNA fragment with one SfiI recognition site
was obtained by a double digestion of plasmid pEOF250 with
NspI and HindIII restriction endonucleases. The fragment
was purified from an agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), ethanol precipi-
tated and dissolved in HE buffer (10 mM HEPES and 1 mM
EDTA, pH 7.5). Its concentration was determined from
DNA absorption at 260 nm using the NanoDrop spectropho-
tometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The
17 bp duplex was prepared from the oligonucleotide
50-GGGGCCTCGAGGGCCAT-30 and its complement (Inte-
grated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) by mixing in
TNM buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM
MgCl2), heating to 95
C and slow cooling to room tempera-
ture. The duplex formation was monitored with a non-
denaturing PAGE.
Labeling procedure
A typical labeling reaction mixture contained a 2:1 molar
ratio of the SfiI tetramer per DNA recognition site, e.g. 100
fmol of SfiI tetramer and 25 fmol of plasmid DNA (two
recognition sites in each molecule), in 10 ml of reaction buffer
A (10 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM
EDTA and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The mixture was incubated

for 15 min at room temperature followed by addition of
the DNA duplex and subsequent incubation for 15 min. The
complex was purified by filtration through a Millipore UFC7
column, and the protein-bound DNA was eluted with 20 ml of
reaction buffer. To test the stability of labeled DNA at differ-
ent pH, the buffer was changed after the first round of filtra-
tion and additional two rounds of filtration were done with
another buffer on the same column. Low pH acetate buffer
(100 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM DTT,
pH 5.0) and high pH bicarbonate buffer (100 mM sodium
bicarbonate, CaCl2 and 1 mM DTT, pH 9.0) were used for
this procedure.
AFM imaging procedure
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) procedure has been des-
cribed previously (14,17). Briefly, freshly cleaved mica was
treated with 167 mM water solution of aminopropylsilatrane
(17) for 30 min. DNA samples (3–4 ml) were placed onto
APS-mica for 2 min; then the sample was rinsed with deion-
ized water (Labconco Co., Kansas City, MO) and dried in
argon flow. Images were acquired in air with MultiMode
SPM NanoScope IV system (Veeco/Digital Instruments,
Santa Barbara, CA) and TESP probes (Tapping Mode Etched
Silicon Probes, spring constant 42 N/m and resonant fre-
quency 320 kHz). Image processing was performed with
the Femtoscan software (Advanced Technologies Center,
Moscow, Russia). Statistical analysis of the yield of different
DNA structures was performed with the sets of 200–400
molecules for each sample.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The possibility to use SfiI for the site-specific DNA labeling
was tested with the 362 bp DNA fragment with a well-defined
position of the SfiI binding site. In the presence of SfiI two
fragment molecules form the X-shaped synaptic structure
with the protein positioned at a cross point (Figure 1A).
Ca2+ was used to stabilize the synaptic complex. In the pres-
ence of calcium SfiI can normally bind to DNA, however its
cleavage activity is inhibited (18). At DNA concentration in
the nanomolar range, the yield of synaptic complexes was
65–70%. The yield of the two-fragment synaptic complex
decreased to 45–55% when the 17 bp DNA duplex was
added to the reaction mixture even at the 1:1 molar ratio. At
the same time separate DNA fragments carrying clearly iden-
tified SfiI molecules were observed. These were the synaptic
complexes involving the 362 bp fragment and the 17 bp
duplex. The latter was not visible due to its small size. Images
of the SfiI/DNA complexes prepared at a 1000-fold excess
of the 17 bp duplex over the 362 bp fragment are shown

in Figure 1B. The labeled individual DNA molecules are
indicated with arrows. Note that no such complexes were
observed in the absence of the duplex. The length measure-
ments data are shown in Figure 1C. The short arm length of
53 ± 2 nm and the total fragment length of 125 ± 5 nm corre-
spond to the 169 bp distance between the recognition site
and one fragment end, and the total fragment length of 362
bp. The contour length measurements show that the protein
position on the 362 bp fragment is slightly asymmetric and
perfectly coincided with the expected position of the SfiI bind-
ing site. A minor number of unspecific complexes could
be found with protein sitting at the end of the fragment.
Only 3 of 1716 complexes analyzed had the position of the
protein exceeding 3 SD values. The standard deviation for
the measurements of the SfiI position taken over >300 com-
plexes was 7.3% of the mean value compared with 5.5% for
the contour length measurements on bare DNA. This means
that the accuracy for the SfiI labeling procedure is only 20%
less than contour length measurements regardless of the
inevitable loss of accuracy due to the large protein size. The
dependencies of the yields of different types of complexes
on the duplex-to-fragment ratio are shown in Figure 1D.
This graph shows that even at the equimolar duplex-to-
fragment ratio, 15% of protein–DNA complexes involved
labeled 362 bp fragments. The yield of the protein-labeled
DNA fragments increased with increasing duplex concentra-
tion and reached 30%. Overall, the data obtained support
the feasibility of using the SfiI based approach for site-
specific labeling.
To extend the proposed approach to labeling supercoiled
DNA we used plasmid pEO200 containing two recognition
sites at a 200 bp distance. Enzyme binding to two sites should
either result in DNA looping if the SfiI tetramer brings
together two recognition sites in the same plasmid, or in a
short duplex-assisted binding of two SfiI tetramers to both
recognition sites in the plasmid (double-labeled circular
DNA). AFM images of the complex formed by SfiI with plas-
mid pEO200 in the absence of the 17 bp duplex are shown in
Figure 2A where DNA loops closed by the SfiI tetramer are
seen. The loop size of 72 ± 5 nm is very close to the expected
value of 68 nm for the 200 bp distance between the two SfiI
binding sites. In the presence of the 17 bp duplex, double-
labeled plasmids are observed in addition to those containing
the SfiI-closed loops. At a 1000-fold molar excess of the
17 bp duplex over the plasmid, the plasmid molecules labeled
at both recognition sites (Figure 2B) are the major type of the
complexes (60%). The measured distances between the
labels have a narrow distribution around the mean value of
73 ± 5 nm (Figure 2C), which is the same as the size of
the SfiI-closed loops and which agrees well with the expected
distance of 68 nm or 200 bp between the two recognition
sites. We also tested plasmid labeling in a broad range of
the 17 bp duplex concentrations and determined the yields
of various products (Figure 2D). At increasing duplex con-
centrations, the yield of double-labeled plasmids increased at
the expense of plasmids with the SfiI-closed loops. The per-
centage of double-labeled molecules leveled off at 55–60%
when the molar duplex-to-plasmid ratio was >1000:1. Thus,
the data obtained show unambiguously that the proposed
methodology is capable of labeling two sites within the
plasmid.
The experiments described above were performed with
a natively supercoiled DNA sample (superhelical density,
s ¼ 0.05). It levels off at 100:1 for this sample. Also,
since plasmid superhelicity may vary in a broad range, we
tested whether the labeling efficiency was affected by DNA
supercoiling. To evaluate the effect of DNA supercoiling,
we performed experiments with an open circular DNA
obtained by the treatment of plasmid pEO200 with the site-
specific nicking enzyme Nt.BstNBI (Figure 3). SfiI binding
to the plasmid in the absence of the 17 bp duplex resulted
in the formation of SfiI-closed DNA loops (Figure 3A). The
yield of looped structures was 80%. Adding of the compet-
ing duplex changes the morphology of SfiI-DNA complexes.
Figure 3B shows the images of selected double-labeled mole-
cules (ca. 30% of total different complexes) taken for the
sample prepared at the 1000-fold molar excess of the 17 bp
duplex over relaxed plasmid. Similarly to the previous data

in the reaction mixture.

different duplex:plasmid ratios were performed and various
types of the SfiI complexes were counted. The yields of the
complexes with open circular DNA leveled off when the
duplex/plasmid ratio reached 1000:1 (Figure 3C). Interest-
ingly, the double labeling of relaxed DNA was two times
less efficient compared with the supercoiled DNA. Given
the higher probability of the site juxtaposition in supercoiled
DNA compared with an open circular DNA, one should
anticipate an opposite trend—higher efficiency of the short
duplex-assisted SfiI binding to separate sites in relaxed
DNA. However, the obtained results suggest that other fac-
tors, such as the relative orientation of protein binding sites
(phasing) and local DNA winding angles, both of which
depend on DNA supercoiling, can contribute to the stability
of the cis synaptic complex in supercoiled DNA.
We also tested for the possible interference of this labeling
procedure with the formation of alternative DNA structures
stabilized by negative DNA supercoiling. We used plasmid
pEOF200 which differs from plasmid pEO200 by insertion
of the inverted repeat F14C, capable of cruciform formation
at the supercoiled density below s ¼ 0.03 (2,19), into the
200 bp segment between the two SfiI binding sites. If the
cruciform extruded, the distance between the recognition
sites would be 200 bp. Selected images of the plasmid
pEOF200 complexed with SfiI in the absence and presence
of the 17 bp duplex are shown in Figure 4A and B, respec-
tively. In the absence of the 17 bp duplex, 86% of plasmid
molecules had SfiI-closed loops (Figure 4A) with the cruci-
form positioned at the loop apex (the cruciforms are indicated
with arrows). The number of looped complexes decreased
two times (to 40%) when the 1000-fold molar excess of
the 17 bp duplex was added to the reaction mixture. This
decrease was accompanied primarily by the formation of
the double-labeled complexes shown in Figure 4B. The con-
tour length measurements show that the labels are positioned
at the distance of 35 ± 2 nm from the center of the cruciform
(Figure 4C), which correlates well with the expected 100 bp
distance between the recognition sites and the cruciform. Sta-
tistical analysis performed over more then 300 molecules
showed that the standard deviation for the SfiI position mea-
sured relative to the cruciform position is 6.3%. This value is
slightly exceeding the accuracy for the length measurements
(5.5%) suggesting that the accuracy of the labeling is 15%
less than the accuracy for the contour length measurements.

The titration data obtained in a broad range of duplex con-
centrations (Figure 4D) show that the percentage of the
SfiI-closed loops decreased with the increase of the duplex
concentration and reached a plateau at 40% when the
duplex-to-plasmid ratio was above 1000:1. At the same
time, the number of double-labeled molecules increased up
to 35%, whereas the number of molecules labeled at the
single position increased slowly to 20%.
If SfiI/DNA complexes are to be used for identification of
pH-dependent local DNA structures, such as H-DNA (16), it
is instructive to evaluate the stability of complexes at differ-
ent pH. For this experiment, SfiI was bound to plasmid
pEO200 at the duplex-to-plasmid ratio of 1000:1 to obtain
a high yield of the double-labeled complexes. The sample,
prepared at pH 7.5, was divided into three aliquots and the
pH was adjusted to 5.0 and 9.0 in two of them. Figure 5
shows that the percentage of the double-labeled molecules
decreased from 50% at pH 7.5 to 38 and 26% at pH 5.0
and pH 9.0, respectively. This decrease in double-labeled
molecules was accompanied by an increase in the amount
of unlabeled DNA (from 3 to 4% at pH 7.5 to 12% at pH
5.0 and to 25% at pH 9.0). It is quite surprising that the com-
plex remains stable under conditions quite far from the most
optimal ones. Such a relatively high complex stability is a
useful feature for the labeling procedure extending the
range of the conditions for its use.
CONCLUSION
The data obtained show that the restriction enzyme SfiI can
be used as a site-specific label for circular DNA molecules
if a short DNA duplex is used as a helper to stabilize the
formation of the site-specific synaptic complex. SfiI binds
as tetramer of the total molecular weight ca 124 kDa which
is easily distinguished on the DNA molecule by AFM (and
EM). The protocol is simple and requires an inexpensive
commercially available protein. Importantly, the weak depen-
dence of labeling efficiency on DNA supercoiling, sig-
nificantly broadens the range of the labeling application
protocol. The fact that labeling does not interfere with the
formation of cruciforms is another important feature of the
developed method in applications where alternative structures
are involved. The tolerance of the complex to the pH change
is another important feature of the SfiI based protocol extend-
ing the application from pH 5 to 9. Although the major focus
of the paper is the labeling of circular DNA, the procedure
can be applied to labeling of linear molecules. The labeling
of linear molecules can be useful if the molecules are long
and the position of the SfiI site is in relatively close proximity
to the areas of interest. The proposed approach utilizes SfiI
enzyme that requires relatively long site for the recognition
that may not present in the plasmid of interest. The procedure
can be extended to other type II enzymes recognizing shorter
DNA sequences the enzymatic activity of which is blocked
by replacing Mg2+ with Ca2+ (e.g. NgoMIV). Our recent
experiments showed that EcoRII restriction enzyme belong-
ing to the same type II family (20) can be another potential
candidate. This enzyme forms the synaptic complexes in
the dimeric form compared to the tetrameric form for SfiI.
It also does not cut in the absence of Mg2+ cations and is
capable of binding DNA in the absence of divalent cations.
However these properties in terms of the accuracy of the
labeling need to be investigated thoroughly. This work is in
progress.
