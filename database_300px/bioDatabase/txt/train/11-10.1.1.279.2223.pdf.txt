ABSTRACT
Hybridization of nucleic acids with secondary
structure is involved in many biological processes
and technological applications. To gain more
insight into its mechanism, we have investigated
the kinetics of DNA hybridization/denaturation
via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
on perfectly matched and single-base-mismatched
DNA strands. DNA hybridization shows non-
Arrhenius behavior. At high temperature, the appar-
ent activation energies of DNA hybridization are
negative and independent of secondary structure. In
contrast, when temperature decreases, the appar-
ent activation energies of DNA hybridization change
to positive and become structure dependent.
The large unfavorable enthalpy of secondary struc-
ture melting is compensated for by concomitant
duplex formation. Based on our results, we propose
a reaction mechanism about how the melting of
secondary structure influences the hybridization
process. A significant point in the mechanism is
that the rate-limiting step switches along with
temperature variation in the hybridization process
of structured DNA, because the free energy profile
of hybridization in structured DNA varies with the
variation in temperature.
INTRODUCTION
A nucleic acid strand recognizes its complementary strand
according to the Watson–Crick rules for base pairing. The
kinetic and thermodynamic properties of short oligonu-
cleotides (1–4) and long DNAs (5) have been investigated
in solution via UV absorbance hyperchromicity. The
results indicate that, for duplex formation of oligonucleo-
tides, the rate-limiting step is the formation of a transient
intermediate with a few base pairs called nucleus, and then
the rest of the bases form fully bound helix quickly (3).
However, this simple model is only applicable to duplex
formation from random-coil strands.
Already, many researchers (6–12) have focused on how
secondary structure inﬂuences the thermodynamic stabil-
ity and kinetic properties of double-stranded nucleic acids.
A secondary structure forms when a single strand has two
or more stretches of complementary sequences (we call it
structured nucleic acid in this article). Among various
secondary structures, hairpin is common and usually
serves as a model for the study of structured nucleic acid.
In recent years, hairpin probes have been widely used in
DNA detection (13) and DNA microarray (14), because
they are more speciﬁc in discriminating of single-base-
mismatch (SM) strands from perfectly matched (PM)
strands than random-coil DNA probes. In our previous
work, we found that the speciﬁcity of hairpin probes is
greatly enhanced when the probes are coupled with an
electric ﬁeld on silicon surface (15,16). Bonnet and
co-workers (17,18) have given a quantitative analysis on
the origin of the speciﬁc recognition of structured DNA.
The eﬀect of secondary structure on thermodynamics
(6,8,9) and kinetics (7,9,10) of nucleic acid duplex has also
been investigated, and some principles have been laid on
how the secondary structure inﬂuences the hybridization
process. However, to our knowledge, few models on the
hybridization of structured strands have been proposed,
and it is not very clear how a hairpin structure participates
in the hybridization process. Systematic investigation on
the inﬂuence of secondary structure on the kinetics of
hybridization/denaturation is highly desired and
beneﬁcial.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (19,20)
is a powerful tool to monitor the conformational changes
of biological molecules, such as proteins (21–23) and
nucleic acids (24–28), in real time. FRET has the
advantage of high sensitivity on monitoring conforma-
tional changes as its signal is inversely proportional to the
sixth power of the distance between two dyes (19).
Furthermore, the high signal sensitivity of ﬂuorescence

is helpful in the rate measurement on DNA hybridization
(29). The molecular beacon (13) and FRET techniques
have been used for studying the kinetics of hairpin
opening/closing (24–26). FRET has also been applied to
study DNA hybridization in solution (29), on microsphere
(30) and on solid surface (31).
In this article, we have studied the eﬀect of secondary
structure on the kinetics and reaction mechanism of DNA
hybridization by FRET technique using 50-Atto-532-
labeled DNA as a donor and 30-Dabcyl-labeled DNA as
a non-ﬂuorescent quencher. Hybridization of DNA brings
the quencher into close proximity with the ﬂuorophore for
eﬃcient ﬂuorescence quenching, while dissociation of
DNA separates two moieties and the ﬂuorescent signal
is restored. By monitoring the ﬂuorescent signals, we
measured the thermodynamic melting curves and kinetic
reaction curves of structured and random-coil DNAs with
their PM and SM strands. At high temperature, both
hairpin and random-coil DNAs had similar negative
hybridization activation energies. However, at low tem-
perature, the structured DNA had much higher hybridiza-
tion activation energies than the random-coil ones.
Our results were consistent with an intuitive scenario
that it might not be necessary to fully open a hairpin for
initiating the formation of a duplex. We proposed a model
for the hybridization of structured DNA, in which the
rate-limiting step switches with temperature variation. The
entropy-controlled barrier of nucleation dominates at high
temperature, while the enthalpy-controlled barrier of
melting of secondary structure dominates at low
temperature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oligodeoxynucleic acid sequences and chemicals
All oligonucleotide strands were designed by ourselves
and used as received. Thermodynamic prediction for
the hairpin design and oligonucleotide hybridization
was supported via Mfold software by Zuker (32)
and HytherTM software from Santalucia’s Laboratory
(33). Table 1 lists all the DNA sequences used in this
work. We took a random-coil strand (L0) and a six-stem
hairpin strand (H6) with their PM (TP) and SM (TS)
DNAs. For FRET detection, four strands were labeled
with 30-Atto-532 (L0A and H6A) or 50-Dabcyl (TPD and
TSD). Finally, a non-hairpin strand (L6), which had the
same length and the same complementary sequence as
H6 was chosen for comparison. L0A and H6A were
purchased from ATTOTEC, Germany. The other DNAs
were purchased from Sangon Company, China.
The secondary structure aﬀects both thermo-stability
of the species and kinetic proﬁle of the reaction. We
designed the DNA sequences carefully to isolate
the inﬂuence of secondary structure on kinetics from the
thermo-stability. While the hairpin structure decreases the
thermo-stability of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
(17,18), the 12 more bases in H6 series as compared to
L0 serve as an overhang in the duplex, which increases the
thermo-stability of dsDNA (34,35) and compensates for
the inﬂuence of hairpin structure. We found approxi-
mately the same thermo-stability of duplexes composed of
structured (H6 series) and random-coil (L0 series) single-
stranded DNAs (ssDNAs), so that the inﬂuence of
secondary structure on kinetics can be examined on
isolated condition.
The buﬀer solution used in this work was TE (1). The
buﬀer solution TE (20) was purchased from Molecular
Probe and diluted with water. The composition of TE
(20) is 200mM Tris-HCl and 20mM EDTA, with pH
7.5. Water (18.2M  cm) was treated through PALL.
UV absorbance measurement
UV absorbance spectra were recorded using JASCO-810
Spectropolarimeter (JASCO Corporation, Japan).
Equal molar complementary strands were pre-hybridized
at a temperature well below the melting temperature (Tm)
overnight to form stable dsDNAs. Absorbance hyper-
chromicity melting curves were recorded by monitoring
absorbance at 260 nm in solution. Melting curves
were recorded from a temperature well below Tm to a
temperature well above Tm at a linear heating rate
of 208C/h.
Fluorescence measurement
Fluorescence signal was measured on a microscopic
spectrometer (Renishaw 1000, Britain) with a temperature

controller THMS 600 (Linkam Scientiﬁc Instruments
Ltd, Britain). Atto-532 was excited at 514 nm, and the
ﬂuorescence emission spectra of Atto-532 were collected
from 542 to 568 nm. The signal was deﬁned as the
integrated area of the ﬂuorescent spectral curve.
Pre-hybridization was carried out to form stable
dsDNA from equal molar complementary strands as
in the absorbance measurement. Melting curves
were recorded by increasing the temperature from well
below Tm to well above Tm at a linear heating rate of
208C/h.
DNA hybridization and dissociation rates were mea-
sured via three methods. Method 1: At a temperature well
below Tm, Atto-labeled DNA and complementary
Dabcyl-labeled DNA solutions were quickly mixed up,
then DNA hybridization rate was measured through the
variation of ﬂuorescence signal with increasing time.
Method 2: Pre-hybridized DNA duplex solution was
quickly heated from a low temperature to a temperature
near Tm. Both DNA hybridization and dissociation rates
were obtained from ﬂuorescence relaxation time with
diﬀerent concentrations of Dabcyl-labeled DNA. Method
3: DNA dissociation rate was detected by the label
dilution technique developed by Morrison and Stols
(29). Excess non-labeled DNA complementary to
Dabcyl-labeled DNA was mixed up with pre-hybridized
DNA solution before jumping temperature. The concen-
tration of Atto-labeled DNA was 5 nM in Methods 1, 2
and 3. The concentrations of Dabcyl-labeled DNA were
250 nM in Method 1, 5 nM in Method 3, 100 nM, 400 nM,
700 nM and 1 mM in Method 2. The concentration of non-
labeled DNA was 500 nM in Method 3.

We set the concentration of Dabcyl-labeled DNA to be
in excess over the concentration of Atto-labeled DNA
(at least 20 times larger), so that the DNA hybridization,
which we have proved to be a second-order reaction, could
be regarded as a quasi-ﬁrst-order reaction. Then the

When temperature approaches Tm, the dissociation rate
increases and Equation (6) is no longer suitable. Then
Method 2 is applied. Values of kd and kh are extracted
from the concentration dependence of 1/ in Equation (5).
The plot of 1/ against the concentration of Dabcyl-
labeled DNA yields kh from the slope and kd from the
Y-intercept.

the dissociation rate is detectable (29), and the relaxation

Simulation of hybridization energy profiles using nearest
neighbor parameters
The nearest neighbor model has been used to predict
thermodynamic parameters of duplex (33,37,38) and
energy proﬁles of helix formation (39), approximately.

formation of n base pairs between two single strands, the

RESULTS
dsDNAmelting curves and thermodynamics of DNA
hybridization
Melting curves of non-labeled dsDNA were recorded by
absorbance method at a duplex concentration of 2 mM,
while melting curves of dye-labeled dsDNA were recorded
by both absorbance and ﬂuorescence methods at a duplex
concentration of 1 mM. Typical melting curves are shown
in Figure 1, and all thermodynamic parameters ﬁtted from
melting curves and predicted from software (33) are listed
in Table 2. All the melting curves were corrected for
sloping baselines as in Marky and Breslauer’s article (36).
We checked the reversibility and the reliability of the
measurements. The cooling curve overlapped with the
melting curve, which showed that the dissociation and
hybridization processes were reversible under our experi-
mental condition (Supporting Information). The thermo-
dynamic parameters ﬁtted from the single melting curve
through Equations (1) and (2) were in agreement with
more laborious measurements of Tm variation upon
concentration variation (Supporting Information).
Some observations can be made from the results. First,
the thermodynamic parameters of non-labeled DNA are
consistent with those of prediction using software. Second,
the duplexes of L6 with overhang bases are more stable
than the duplexes of L0. The thermo-stability of H6 series
is approximately the same as the thermo-stability of L0
series, which is in agreement with our design. Also, H6A
series have the same stability as L0A series. Finally, our
results indicated that labeling of Atto-532 at the 30 end of
one strand and Dabcyl at the 50 end of the complementary
strand reduces the enthalpy of duplex dissociation and
increases the thermo-stability (reﬂected through Tm) of
duplex by 1.4 0.48C. This phenomenon is consistent with
previous studies (29,41). Generally speaking, the eﬀect of
dye labeling on stability of dsDNA is not substantial. We
assumed that dye labeling also has minor eﬀect on kinetics
of DNA hybridization/denaturation.
Kinetic data of DNA dissociation and hybridization
Some typical kinetic data are presented in Figure 2.
In most cases, the data were well ﬁtted by single
exponential curve. However, when the temperature was
too low, the kinetic data deviated from single exponential
curve but could be ﬁtted by double exponential one. The
source of deviation at low temperature was not clear. It
could be due to the formation of some intermediate
conﬁgurations. We chose the temperature ranges in which
all the kinetic data were in accordance with single
exponential curves. Care was taken at the high-tempera-
ture end so that the rate measurement was reliable within

the time resolution of the apparatus. We checked the
reaction orders of the oligonucleotide hybridization and
dissociation under our condition. Consistent with
previous studies (5,29,42), our results veriﬁed that
hybridization is a second-order reaction and dissociation
is a ﬁrst-order reaction (Supporting Information).
In the region around Tm, Methods 2 and 3 were
applicable. The dissociation rate constants measured from
the two methods were plotted in Figure 3 and they agree
well with each other on kd. The large relative error in
Method 2 comes from the fact that the value of absolute
error in Y-intercept remains almost constant while the
value of Y-intercept (kd) goes down quickly. In the
temperature range we studied, kd exhibits Arrhenius
behaviors. Ead is 140 kcal/mol for dissociation of PM
duplex, while it is 120 kcal/mol for dissociation of SM
duplex (Table 3), no matter whether ssDNA has a
secondary structure or not.
Hybridization rates were measured with Methods 1 and
2. Method 2 was only suitable for temperatures around
Tm, while Method 1 was applied from temperature below
Tm to room temperature. When the temperature was close
to Tm, kd contributed a great deal to 1/ in Method 1, and
subtraction of kd was made by using the values obtained
from Method 2. Although Methods 1 and 2 were mostly
applied in diﬀerent temperature ranges, they overlapped
slightly, which allowed us to check the consistency
(Figure 4). We found that when temperature decreased
from Tm to room temperature, the apparent activation
energies of hybridization (Eah) (Table 3) changed
from negative to positive, and hybridization rate constant
showed a non-Arrhenius behavior (Figure 4). It was
observed that at high temperature, values of Eah were
similar and satisﬁed the equation
Eah  Ead ¼ HVH 9
for all four duplexes. At low temperature, Eah of
structured DNAs were higher than those of random-coil
DNAs. Furthermore, Eah of SM DNA was higher than
that of PM DNA for structured strands, while for
random-coil strands, Eah of SM DNA and PM DNA
were approximately the same.
DISCUSSION
General features
In our study, the hybridization rate constant exhibited
non-Arrhenius behavior and the apparent activation
energies of hybridization changed from negative at high
temperature to positive at low temperature. Porschke

activation energies (15 kcal/mol) for simple An–Tn
duplex and positive hybridization activation energies
(10 kcal/mol) for duplex containing GC base pairs by
UV method at temperatures around Tm. Morrison and
Stols (29) also reported positive hybridization activation
energies for 10 mer (9.94 kcal/mol) and 20 mer (16.4 kcal/
mol) by FRET method at temperatures well below Tm.
Our results are in overall agreement with the above
observations. Porschke and co-workers (3,4) proposed
that at low temperature, diﬀusion-controlled nucleation
process is the origin of positive Eah. This could also be
applied to our random-coil DNA. At high temperature,
the negative apparent hybridization activation energy
is compatible with the model that nucleation is the
rate-limiting step (3,43). As temperature decreases, the
rate-limiting step switches to diﬀusion-controlled process,
so that the apparent activation energies of hybridization
become positive as in Porschke’s work. According to
standard chemical kinetic theory (44), a negative apparent
activation energy is an indication of the existence of a
metastable intermediate in the rate-limiting step and of a
barrier between this metastable intermediate and the
product. Based on the previous theory of DNA hybridiza-
tion and our observation of the negative apparent
activation energy, the barrier at high temperature is due
to nucleation.
Similar negative activation energies at high temperature
among PM, SM, random coil and structured strands
suggest that they should all go through the nucleation
process. A nucleus usually contains a few base pairs.
Nucleation may occur at diﬀerent sites (1) and prefers to
begin from GC base pairs (4,5). Chu and Tinoco suggested
that mismatch bases, bulge bases and bases next to them
do not take part in the nucleation (7). Obviously, the stem
bases in hairpin cannot participate in nucleus formation.
Except for these restricted bases, other ‘free’ bases may
form nucleus when the length of continuous ‘free’ bases is
long enough. The more the number of appropriate base-
pair combinations, the faster the nucleation is. The drop
of the fastest hybridization rate of SM strands from that
of PM could be due to the reduction in the number of
nucleation sites caused by the interruption of mismatched
position. On the same bases, the fastest hybridization rate
of structured strands is smaller than that of random-coil
strands.
Influence of secondary structure on DNA hybridization
In our study, the Tm (50.68C) of structured DNA
(H6/H6A) was higher than most temperatures at which
we carried out kinetic rate measurements, which means
that H6/H6A kept their secondary structures when they
were involved in hybridization process at those tempera-
tures. Thus, the low value of Eah of structured PM DNA
(23.7 kcal/mol) compared with the energy necessary to
melt the hairpin (49.2 kcal/mol) at low temperature
suggests that a partial duplex is formed before the melting
of the hairpin structure, so that the large unfavorable
enthalpy of hairpin melting is compensated by the energy
of concomitant partial duplex formation (6).
At high temperature, both structured DNA and
random-coil DNA have negative Eah, and the diﬀerence
between them is rather small compared with the additional
melting energy of the hairpin stem. This indicates that the
major source of the diﬀerence is not hairpin melting, and
the melting of secondary structure should occur after the
rate-limiting step. In contrast, the diﬀerence between
kinetics of structured and random-coil oligonucleotides
shows up at low temperature. Not only structured and
random-coil duplexes have diﬀerent Eah, but also PM- and
SM-structured dsDNAs have diﬀerent Eahs. The higher
Eah of structured DNA at low temperature implies that
the dissociation of the stem, which is an energy consuming
process, is involved in the rate-limiting step, and this fact
has to be incorporated into our kinetic models.

Furthermore, the diﬀerence of Eah between structured
H6A/TPD and H6A/TSD dsDNAs is almost the same as
the diﬀerence between respective enthalpies of formation
(H8), which equals the enthalpy change induced by
mismatch base. This phenomenon suggests that, at low
temperature, the mismatch position in TSD is involved in
the rate-limiting step of hybridization for structured
DNA. Additional experiment on a diﬀerent SM strand
shows that the kinetics of oligonucleotide hybridization/
dissociation is very sensitive to the mismatch position in
the case of structured DNA with mismatch (Supporting
Information).
Effect of temperature on reaction mechanism
According to the transition state theory (44), the reaction
rate is controlled by the activation free energy (G6¼)
through
k ¼ k0e-G
6¼
RT 10
where k0 is a constant. G
6¼, in turn, is determined by the
activation enthalpy (H 6¼) and activation entropy (S6¼)
through G 6¼ ¼H 6¼ TS6¼, where H 6¼ and S6¼ are
approximately constant. Although people normally use
potential barrier, activation energy or activation enthalpy
to identify the rate-limiting step, the true rate-limiting step
should be the one with the slowest reaction rate, which is
determined by the activation free energy as illustrated in
Equation (10). According to Equation (10), the rate-
limiting step should have the highest G6¼. Only when the
contribution of S6¼ is not important, one may use the
largest H6¼ to identify the rate-limiting step. Therefore,
the analysis on the free energy proﬁle will be helpful to
understand the mechanism of reaction.
Let us ﬁrst focus on the random-coil DNA. As
discussed before, the hybridization of random-coil DNA
is controlled by nucleation at high temperature and
becomes a diﬀusion-controlled process at low tempera-
ture. According to this model, the schematic potential
proﬁle and diﬀerent proﬁles of activation free energy at
high and low temperatures can be drawn as in Figure 5a
and b.
For the structured DNA, we propose the following
schematic picture for the potential proﬁle (Figure 5c) and
free energy proﬁles (Figure 5d) for the reaction. Similar to
random-coil DNA, nucleus is ﬁrstly formed. After over-
coming the barrier of nucleation, more base pairs are
formed. However, diﬀerent from random-coil DNA, in
order to go further, the hairpin structure has to be
destructed which creates the second reaction barrier,
otherwise the extension of the more rigid dsDNA
conﬁguration is not possible. After crossing over the
second barrier, the full length of duplex forms quickly.
Whether the character of the stem-loop structure con-
tributes to the apparent activation energy depends on
which of the two barriers is involved in the rate-limiting
step. At low temperature, the free energy proﬁle is mainly
controlled by the potential energy, so that the rate-limiting
step is hairpin opening. Melting of hairpin structure is an
entropy-increasing process, which leads to reduction of
the second free energy barrier when temperature increases.
In contrast, nucleation is an entropy-reducing process, so
that the ﬁrst free energy barrier increases as temperature
increases. At some point, the height of the ﬁrst peak in free
energy proﬁle becomes larger than the second one
(Figure 5d), and then according to Equation (10) the
rate-limiting step switches from the melting of hairpin to
the nucleation. As a result, the kinetic characters of
structured and random-coil dsDNAs become identical

at high temperature, exhibiting negative apparent
activation energies.
Nucleation model for random-coil DNA
The number of base pairs formed in the nucleation process
can be estimated using the nucleation model (43). In this
model
Eah ¼ H1 þ ðnN  1ÞH

f þ Eh 11
where Eah is the apparent activation energy of random-
coil DNA hybridization, H

1 is the enthalpy of ﬁrst base-
pair formation between two free ssDNAs, H

f is the
mean enthalpy of one base-pair formation except for the
ﬁrst one, Eh is the association activation energy of one pair
formation and nN is the number of base pairs formed in
the nucleation process. Because destruction of hydrogen
bonds between bases and water compensates the energy
from forming hydrogen bonds between base pairs, H

1
should be very small without stacking energy (43). Eh is
positive as it is for an elementary reaction and should not
be very large (43). H

f is known to be on the order of 6
to 10 kcal/mol depending on the conditions (33,45).
Plugging in our experimental Eah, nN is found to be 3–4.
Our results via FRET method are similar to previous
reports via absorbance method (3,43).
Concerted model for structured DNA
Inspired by the nucleation model, we extend Equation (11)
to handle the structured DNA and to determine how and
when the hairpin structure opens. The energy of the
intermediate during hairpin opening can be expressed as
Eah ¼ H1 þ ðnC  1ÞH

f  nsH

s þ Eh 12
where nC is the number of base pairs formed between two
single strands in this intermediate, ns is number of stem
base pairs in the intermediate and H

s is the mean
enthalpy of one base-pair formation in the hairpin. The
meaning of other symbols is the same as those in Equation
(11). The maximum value of nsH

s is 49.2 kcal/mol
according to the Mfold program (32). Eah is 23.7 kcal/mol
for PM-structured strand. By using the same parameters
as in the previous section to ﬁt our experimental Eah,
the value nC 5–6 is obtained. On the other hand, the
diﬀerence between hybridization activation energies of
PM and SM strands at low temperature implies that the
mismatched base-pair is involved in the step of hairpin
opening, but the mismatch point cannot participate in the
nucleation process, which has 3–4 bp. Therefore, one or
two more base pairs are needed to form in order to extend
the duplex to the mismatch position. In other words, the
concerted opening of hairpin occurs when 5–6 bp are
formed, which include the mismatch position.
Simulation with nearest neighbor parameters
Our models are tested by calculating the enthalpy and free
energy proﬁles during the course of hybridization with the
nearest neighbor parameters (32,33), which is described in
the Materials and methods section. A representative
simulation is presented below by assuming that base
pairs form one by one and the ﬁrst 10 bp form in the order
of g15-t14-a13-t12-g11-a10-c9-a8-g7-a16. Symbol xN stands for
the base that is at the Nth position counted from the 30 end
of L0 or H6 and whose component is x (¼a, g, c or t).
With assumed pathways, typical energy proﬁles are
computed with the nearest neighbor parameters, which
are shown in Figure 6. The potential energy and free
energy proﬁles for the random-coil DNA behave quite
normally, as predicted (Figure 6a). In the hybridization of
structured DNA, correct activation energy is reproduced
only by assuming that hairpin concertedly opens after
the formation of the sixth base pair a10 and before the
formation of the seventh base pair c9 (Figure 6b). The
simulation only considers one by one base-pair formation
and is a simple and rough estimation. Nevertheless, the
simulated results support our reaction mechanism quite
well. There are many other possible pathways for base-
pair formation. We tested some of them, and they all
delivered similar energy proﬁles. Especially, the agreement
with the experimental activation energies in structured
DNA for both SM and PM sequences was reached when
assuming that concerted hairpin opening occurred at the
sixth base-pair formation and the most probable ﬁrst six
base pairs were g15t14a13t12g11a10. The simulation on free
energy proﬁles also conﬁrms our assumption shown in
Figure 5d. First, the bulging of free energy reaction curve
at the 3–4 bp position increases with the increase of
temperature, which results from the entropy penalty

of nucleation. Second, the free energy barrier of hairpin
opening slightly drops with the increase of temperature,
because of entropy release. Third, the opening of
hairpin has to be concerted in order to reproduce
experimental results. Fourth, the free energy barrier of
nucleation is higher than that of hairpin opening at high
temperature, while it is lower than that of hairpin opening
at low temperature. Indeed, the rate-limiting step switches
along with the variation of temperature in the structured
DNAs.
As a complicated reaction, DNA dissociation and
hybridization are inﬂuenced by many factors, such as
secondary structure, temperature, salt concentration and
microenvironment of DNA molecule. The more details we
know about these processes, such as those in PCR, DNA
microarray, gene replication, transcription and regulation,
the more controllable they are. Inspired by our investiga-
tion, more questions can be raised. For instance, our
results show that the structured DNA is more sensitive to
the discrimination of mismatch than random-coil DNA,
and strands with diﬀerent mismatch positions behave very
diﬀerently in hybridization/dissociation. This phenom-
enon suggests that structured strand may be a useful tool
to learn about hybridization by using diﬀerent mismatch
strands or to make high speciﬁc recognition of DNA
sequences. How does the mismatch position take part in
the intermediate of hybridization process for structured
DNA? We wish to address these issues in our future
investigation.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we have examined the eﬀect of secondary
structure on kinetics and reaction mechanism of oligonu-
cleotide hybridization via FRET method. For the
structured DNA, high unfavorable energy of hairpin
melting is compensated by the favorable energy of partial
duplex formation. The change of apparent hybridization
activation energy may be due to the switch of rate-limiting
step at diﬀerent temperatures. Furthermore, we proposed
a model for hybridization of structured DNA, in which
melting of the hairpin structure is concerted. At high
temperature, the rate-limiting step is controlled by entropy
of nucleation, whereas at low temperature, the rate-
limiting step is dominated by enthalpy of melting of
secondary structure.
