ABSTRACT
RNA helicases function in numerous aspects of
RNA biology. These enzymes are RNA-stimulated
ATPases that translocate on RNA and unwind or
remodel structured RNA in an ATP-dependent
fashion. How ATP and the ATPase cycle fuel the
work performed by helicases is not completely
clear. The hepatitis C virus RNA helicase, NS3, is
an important model system for this class of
enzymes. NS3 binding to a single-/double-strand
RNA or DNA junction leads to ATP-independent
melting of the duplex and formation of a complex
capable of ATP-dependent unwinding by using a
spring-loaded mechanism. We have established an
RNA substrate for NS3 that can be unwound in a
single sub-step. Our studies are consistent with a
model in which a single ATP binding and/or hydro-
lysis event sets the unwinding spring and phosphate
dissociation contributes to release of the spring,
thereby driving the power stroke used for
unwinding.
INTRODUCTION
RNA helicases function in myriad aspects of RNA metab-
olism in the cell, and new functions continue to emerge (1).
Viruses also encode RNA helicases (2). The RNA helicase
encoded by hepatitis C virus (HCV), non-structural
protein 3 (NS3), is a DExH-box protein that belongs to
helicase superfamily 2 (SF2) (2). Unlike most DExH-box
proteins, NS3 is also a DNA helicase (2). Although HCV
NS3 RNA helicase activity is essential for virus viability,
the precise role of the RNA helicase activity in the multi-
plication cycle is not known (2).
HCV NS3 has emerged as an important model system
for studies of the kinetics and mechanism of SF2 RNA
helicases (3–9). NS3 binds to its nucleic acid substrate in
multiple forms: monomer, dimer, oligomer, depending on
the length of the single-stranded overhang used for NS3
loading (10,11). After formation of the NS3-nucleic acid
complex, a slow isomerization of this complex occurs that
activates the complex for unwinding (12). It has recently
been suggested that this isomerization may reﬂect an
ATP-independent, local melting of the duplex region
targeted for ATP-dependent unwinding (3). NS3 has
been proposed to use both passive (5) and active (3) mech-
anisms for unwinding. It is possible that a passive mech-
anism is used prior to formation of the activated complex
and an active mechanism used thereafter.
Addition of ATP to a reaction containing activated
complexes leads to multiple cycles of unwinding and
pausing (4,9). The number of cycles of unwinding and
pausing per binding event is dependent on the NS3
oligomeric state, with monomers being the least processive
(4). The kinetic and physical step size for NS3 is 11–18 bp,
again depending on the oligomeric state. This ‘super’ step
of unwinding occurs in sub-steps of 3 bp (3,4), and each
sub-step is thought to occur in three, 1-bp sub-sub-steps
(6). Whether or not the ATPase cycle couples to a sub-step
or a sub-sub-step needs to be clariﬁed.
How the ATPase cycle couples to unwinding is not
completely clear for any helicase but clearly represents
an important frontier for helicase enzymology (13,14).
The realization that NS3 employs an active mechanism
for unwinding suggested that this system might also be
used to address this question. We reasoned that if an
unwinding substrate could be produced that required no
greater than one, 3-bp sub-step for unwinding to occur,
then correlations between the ATPase cycle and unwind-
ing might be possible.

We show that an RNA substrate containing a 20-nt
single-stranded loading strand and a 9-bp duplex can
be unwound in a single sub-step. Importantly, the rate
constant for unwinding was equivalent to the rate
constant for phosphate release during the ATPase cycle.
This study provides the ﬁrst, direct link between a step in
the ATPase cycle and unwinding by an RNA helicase, and
sets the stage for elucidation of the mechanochemical
coupling mechanism employed by RNA helicases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
All RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon
Research, Inc.; All DNA oligonucleotides were from
Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.; [g-32P]-ATP
(7000Ci/mmol) was from MP Biomedical; [a-32P]-ATP
(3000Ci/mmol) was from Perkin Elmer; T4 polynucleotide
kinase was fromUSB; ATPwas fromGEHealthcare; N-[2-
(1-Maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carbox-
amide (MDCC) was from Invitrogen; AMPPNP,
7-methylguanosine and purine nucleoside phosphorylase
were from Sigma; all other reagents were of the highest
grade available from Sigma, Fisher or VWR.
Puriﬁcation and 50-32P-labeling of RNA oligonucleotides
RNA oligonucleotides were puriﬁed by denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and end-
labeled by using [g-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide
kinase as described earlier (15) and are described in
the ‘Materials and Methods’ section provided in
Supplementary Data. Concentrations were determined
by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a
Nanodrop spectrophotometer and using the appropriate
calculated extinction coeﬃcient.
Annealing of unwinding substrates
Oligonucleotides were annealed at 5 mM in 25mMMOPS,
pH 7.0, 50mM NaCl by using a Progene Thermocycler
(Techne). The ratio of loading strand to displaced strand
was 1: 1.2. Annealing reactions were heated to 90C
for 1min and slowly cooled (5C/min) to 40C at which
point MgCl2 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1mM.
After the addition of MgCl2, the reactions were slowly
cooled to 10C.
Construction, expression and puriﬁcation of
full-length HCV NS3 helicase and Escherichia
coli phosphate-binding protein
We constructed expression constructs for HCV NS3 and
phosphate-binding protein (PBP) by using standard
recombinant DNA protocols as described in the
‘Materials and Methods’ section provided in Supple-
mentary Data. Brieﬂy, we ampliﬁed DNA sequences
using the HCV subgenomic replicon 1b con1 strain (16)
(Genbank accession number is AJ238799) as template for
HCV NS3 and plasmid isolated from ANCC75 cells con-
taining the phoS gene with the A197C mutation (17)
(Genbank accession number is AAA24378) as template
for PBP by using the polymerase chain reaction.
Forward and reverse primers employed for ampliﬁcation
were selected based on the presence of unique restriction
sites suitable for subcloning of the mutated DNA
fragment into the expression plasmid.
We used E. coli for expression and puriﬁcation of HCV
NS3 and PBP as described in the ‘Materials and Methods’
section provided in Supplementary Data. Brieﬂy, we
transformed cells with the appropriate plasmid and used
these cells to produce an inoculum for large-scale growth.
We induced gene expression during exponential growth
by addition of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside or
by using auto-induction media (18). We lysed induced
cells in appropriate buﬀers, and puriﬁed the enzymes to
apparent homogeneity by using standard column chroma-
tography resins and protocols.
MDCC-labeling of PBP
Puriﬁed PBP was labeled with MDCC in the presence
of a phosphate sponge. The phosphate sponge
removes trace Pi from solution by covalently coupling
7-methylguanosine with Pi enzymatically using purine
nucleoside phosphorylase. Reactions, typically 1ml, con-
tained 100 mM A197C PBP, 500mM MDCC, 200 mM
7-methylguanosine and 0.2U/ml purine nucleoside
phosphorylase in 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0. Reactions
were incubated at room temperature for 4 h, continuously
mixing using a rotating mixer. Reactions were brieﬂy
centrifuged for 5min at 6000g in a microcentrifuge, then
passed over a 10ml G25 Sephadex column equilibrated
ﬁrst with 300mM 7-methylguanosine and 0.05U/ml
purine nucleoside phosphorylase in 10mM MOPS pH
7.0, 10mM MgCl2 and then 10mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0
and 100mM NaCl. After loading, the column was
subsequently washed with 20ml of 10mM Tris–HCl, pH
8.0 and 50mM NaCl. The pass and wash fractions were
collected and the absorbance at 280 and 430 nm were
measured by using a Nanodrop. The MDCC labeled
PBP concentration was determined after correcting for
the absorbance at 280 nM due to MDCC. The molar
extinction coeﬃcient of PBP and MDCC at 280 nm is
61 880M1 cm1 and 7675M1 cm1, respectively. The
molar extinction coeﬃcient of MDCC at 430 nm is
46 800M1 cm1. The sample was aliquoted and frozen
at 80C until use.
Nucleic acid binding assay
Experiments were performed using a Beacon ﬂuorescence
polarization system (GE Healthcare). The Beacon system
uses a high intensity 100Watt quartz halogen lamp for
360–900 nm excitation. The ﬁlters used for ﬂuorescence
excitation and emission were 490±10 and 525±10 nm,
respectively. Assays were performed by mixing 0.1 nM
30-ﬂuorescein-labeled ds9-C20 with increasing concentra-
tions of either WT or D290A HCV NS3 for 10min in
binding buﬀer (25mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 2mM
b-mercaptoethanol, 10mM MgCl2 and 50mM NaCl)
followed by addition of buﬀer, ATP or AMPPNP
(5mM) and then incubated for an additional 1 or 10min
prior to monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence

polarization (mP). NS3 was diluted immediately prior to
use in 25mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 2mM b-mercaptoethanol,
10mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol and 200mM NaCl. The
volume of NS3 added to the binding reaction was equal
to one–tenth to one–ﬁfth the total volume of the reaction.
All steps were performed in reduced light. To determine
the apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app), polarization
(mP) was plotted as a function of NS3 concentration
and the data were ﬁt to a hyperbola:
mP ¼ mPmax  ½NS3
Kd,app þ ½NS3 þmP0, 1
where mP is the polarization measured, mPmax is the
maximum polarization, mP0 is the initial polarization in
the absence of NS3 and Kd,app is the apparent dissociation
constant.
Nucleotide binding assay
Experiments were performed by using QuantamasterTM,
model QM-1 and RatiomasterTM, model RC-M, ﬂuores-
cence systems with Felix software (Photon Technology
International). Assays were performed by mixing 2 mM
NS3 with increasing concentrations of ATP for 1min in
binding buﬀer (25mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 2mM
b-mercaptoethanol, 10mM MgCl2 and 50mM NaCl)
prior to monitoring the change in relative ﬂuorescence
of NS3. Where indicated, 20 mM ds9-C20 was present in
the binding reaction. The excitation wavelength was
297 nm and the emission wavelength was 333 nm. The
slit widths for excitation and emission were 2 and 6 nm,
respectively. The inner-ﬁlter eﬀect was corrected by using
the following equation:
Fcorr ¼ Fobs  V0 þ Vi

where Fcorr was the corrected ﬂuorescence intensity, Fobs
was the ﬂuorescence intensity measured, V0 was initial
sample volume, Vi was total volume of titrant added
and Absex and Absem were absorbance values at the exci-
tation and the emission wavelengths, respectively (19).
To determine the apparent dissociation constant
(Kd,app), the corrected ﬂuorescence intensity was plotted
as a function of ATP concentration and the data were
ﬁt to a hyperbola:
Fcorr ¼ Fcorr,0  Fcorr  ½ATP
Kd,app þ ½ATP 3
where Fcorr was the corrected ﬂuorescence intensity, Fcorr,0
was the corrected ﬂuorescence intensity in the absence of
NS3 and Kd,app is the apparent dissociation constant.
HCV NS3 helicase assay
Reactions were performed at 25 or 37C. NS3 (2mM) was
mixed with 2 nM [32P]-labeled unwinding substrate in
25mM MOPS pH 7.0, 50mM NaCl and 1mM EDTA.
Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10mM ATP,
10mM MgCl2 and 100 nM trapping strand in 25mM
MOPS pH 7.0, 50mM NaCl. The trapping strand is a
9-mer RNA that is complementary to the displaced
strand. Reactions were quenched at various times by
addition EDTA to 100mM and SDS to 0.33%. Speciﬁc
concentrations of substrate or enzyme, along with any
deviations from the above, are indicated in the appropri-
ate ﬁgure legend. NS3 was diluted immediately prior to
use in 25mM MOPS pH 7.0 and 20% glycerol. The
volume of enzyme added to any reaction was always less
than or equal to one–tenth the total volume. Products
were resolved by native PAGE.
HCV NS3 ATPase assay
Reactions were performed at 37C. Reactions contained
25mM MOPS pH 7.0, 50mM NaCl, 10mM MgCl2,
200 nM NS3, 10mM ATP, 0.05mM [a32P]-ATP and
either 0 or 20 mM unwinding substrate. Reactions were
initiated by the addition of NS3. Reactions were
quenched at various times by addition of EDTA to
100mM. Speciﬁc concentrations of substrate or enzyme,
along with any deviations from the above, are indicated in
the appropriate ﬁgure legend. NS3 was diluted immedi-
ately prior to use in 25mM MOPS, pH 7.0 and 20%
glycerol. The volume of enzyme added to any reaction
was always less than or equal to one–tenth the total
volume. Products were resolved by TLC.
Rapid chemical-quench-ﬂow experiments
Rapid mixing/quenching experiments were performed by
using a Model RQF-3 chemical-quench-ﬂow apparatus
(KinTek Corp., Austin TX, USA). Experiments were per-
formed at 37C by using a circulating water bath. For the
pre-steady-state unwinding assays, 4 mM NS3 was mixed
with 2 nM unwinding substrate in 25mM MOPS pH 7.0,
50mM NaCl and 1mM EDTA at 37C for 10min to ﬁrst
assemble an activated NS3-unwinding substrate complex.
The NS3-unwinding substrate complex was then rapidly
mixed with 20mM ATP, 20mM MgCl2 and 200 nM
trapping strand in 25mM MOPS pH 7.0, 50mM NaCl
using the chemical-quench ﬂow. After mixing, reactant
concentrations were reduced by 50%. Reactions were
rapidly quenched by addition of EDTA to 100mM and
SDS to 0.33%. Products were resolved by native PAGE.
For the pre-steady-state ATPase assays, 4 mM NS3 in
25mM MOPS pH 7.0, 50mM NaCl and 1mM EDTA
was rapidly mixed with 40 mM unwinding substrate and
20 mM [a32P]-ATP in 25mM MOPS pH 7.0, 50mM NaCl
and 20mM MgCl2. After mixing, reactant concentrations
were reduced by 50%. Reactions were rapidly quenched
by addition of EDTA to 100mM. Products were resolved
by TLC.
Product analysis: native PAGE
An equal volume of loading buﬀer, 10 ml, (100mM EDTA,
0.33% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromophenol blue and
0.025% xylene cyanol) was added to 10 ml of the quenched
reaction mixtures and 10 ml was loaded on a 20%
acrylamide, 0.53% bisacrylamide native polyacrylamide
gel containing 1 TBE. Electrophoresis was performed
in 1 TBE at 15mA. Gels were visualized by using
a phosphorimager and quantitated by using the
1314 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 4
ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) to determine
the amount of strand separation. The fraction of RNA
that had been unwound by the helicase was corrected
for the eﬃciency of the trapping strand in preventing
reannealing of products. This correction factor was deter-
mined for each experiment by heating a sample of the
RNA substrate at 95C for 1min then cooled to 10C at
a rate of 5C/min in the presence of the trapping strand.
The quantity of unwinding substrate that was prevented
from reannealing was typically 98%. The amount of
RNA unwound was plotted as a function of time and ﬁt
to either a single [Equation (4)] or double [Equation (5)]
exponential equation.

Product analysis
TLC—1 ml of the quenched reaction was spotted onto
polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (EM Science).
TLC plates were developed in 0.3M potassium phosphate,
pH 7.0, dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen.
TLC plates were visualized by using a PhosphorImager
and quantiﬁed by using the ImageQuant software (molec-
ular dynamics) to determine the amount of ATP
hydrolyzed to ADP. The amount of ADP was plotted as
a function of time and ﬁt to a line or a single exponential

Phosphate release assay by stopped-ﬂow ﬂuorescence
Pre-steady-state phosphate release stopped-ﬂow ﬂuores-
cence experiments were performed using a Model
SF-2001 stopped-ﬂow apparatus (Kintek Corp.) equipped
with a waterbath. All reactions were performed at 37C. A
phosphate sponge that consisted of 7-methylguanosine and
purine nucleoside phosphorylase was present in both
syringes to ensure that free Pi was minimal prior to
mixing. First, 4 mMNS3 was mixed with 40 mM unwinding
substrate, 50 mM 7-methylguanosine and 0.02U/ml purine
nucleoside phosphorylase in 25mMMOPS pH 7.0, 50mM
NaCl and 10mMMgCl2 at 37
C for 10min to assemble the
NS3-unwinding substrate complex. The NS3-unwinding
substrate complex was then rapidly mixed by using the
stopped-ﬂow with 20mM ATP, 4 mM MDCC-labeled
PBP, 250 mM 7-methylguanosine and 0.05U/ml purine
nucleoside phosphorylase in 25mM MOPS pH 7.0,
50mM NaCl and 30mM MgCl2. After mixing, reactant
concentrations were reduced by 50%. Fluorescence
emission was monitored by using a 460 nm cut-on ﬁlter
(Chroma technology corp., Rockingham, VT, USA). The
excitation wavelength used was 435 nm. For each experi-
ment, at least four ﬂuorescence traces were averaged. The
relative ﬂuorescence was plotted as a function of time and
ﬁt to a single exponential equation:
F ¼ A eðkobsetÞ þ C, 7
where F is the relative ﬂuorescence intensity, kobs is the
observed rate constant for phosphate release, t is the time
and C is an oﬀset.
Data analysis
Data were ﬁt by non-linear regression using the program
KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA).
All experiments shown are representative, single experi-
ments that have been performed after at least three indi-
vidual trials to deﬁne the concentration or time range
shown. In all cases, values for parameters measured
during individual trials were within the limits of the
error reported for the ﬁnal experiments.
RESULTS
Design of a minimal substrate (ds9-C20) to study
NS3-catalyzed RNA unwinding
HCV NS3 is a 30!50 translocase that requires 10–20 nt
of single-stranded nucleic acid for eﬃcient loading
(5,10,12,20). A 20-nt loading strand may be suﬃcient to
accommodate binding of an NS3 dimer (21). However, the
oligomeric status of NS3 does not alter the transactions
occurring at the single-(ss)/double-strand (ds) junction,
the site of unwinding, only NS3 processivity (4,20). Both
the kinetic and physical step size for unwinding of ds
nucleic acid by NS3 ranges from 11 bp for a monomer
to 18 bp for a dimer, with the 11–18 bp step being
comprised of multiple 3-bp sub-steps (4). After binding,
NS3 may melt as many as 5 bp of the duplex region
located at the ss/ds junction of a substrate for unwinding
in an ATP-independent fashion (3,5,22). Continued
unwinding would require ATP consumption.
Taking all of this information into account, we designed
a substrate for NS3 unwinding that could potentially be
unwound in a single 3-bp sub-step. This advance would
permit ensemble experiments to be used to relate events
occurring during the unwinding sub-step to events of
the ATPase cycle occurring concurrently. The substrate
is shown in Figure 1a. We refer to this substrate as
ds9-C20. The substrate contains a 9-bp duplex (ds9) and
Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 4 1315
20-nt 30-overhang comprised of 20 cytidylate residues
(C20). The 20-nt overhang should permit a monomer
or dimer to be accommodated, depending upon the
stoichiometry of NS3 to ds9-C20 substrate. Melting of
3 bp of the 9-bp duplex followed by a 3-bp substep
would leave 3 bp annealed that should spontaneously
melt at 37C, leading to release of the 9-nt ‘displaced’
strand.
Binding of ds9-C20 to NS3 is tight and is
modulated by ATP
The ﬁrst question that we asked was how well does the
ds9-C20 substrate bind to NS3. This experiment was per-
formed by using ﬂuorescence polarization. A ds9-C20
substrate was prepared that contained a ﬂuorescein (FL)
molecule on the 30 end of the loading strand (Figure 1a).
We refer to the FL-labeled substrate as ds9-C20-FL.
Placing the FL molecule at any position of the duplex
region of the substrate altered binding aﬃnity. We
titrated NS3 (at least 0.2–5Kd) into binding buﬀer con-
taining ds9-C20-FL (0.1 nM). The change in ﬂuorescence
polarization (mP) was plotted as a function of NS3 con-
centration, and the data were ﬁt to the appropriate model,
generally a hyperbola as described in ‘Materials and
Methods’ section (Figure 1b). The time of incubation
was varied (1 or 10min) prior to recording the mP
values because of reports of a slow assembly of a func-
tional NS3-RNA complex (12). The value for the equilib-
rium dissociation constant (Kd) of the NS3 .ds9-C20
complex was in the 40–50 nM range and was not
impacted substantially by the incubation time (Figure 1c).
It has been shown that ATP weakens the interaction
between NS3 and nucleic acid (5,7,23). As shown in
Figure 1c, in the presence of 5mM ATP, the Kd value
for the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex increased by as much as
7-fold relative to the Kd value determined in the absence
of ATP (Figure 1c). During this experiment, the duplex
was not unwound (Supplementary Figure S1a); ATP was
not completely consumed (Supplementary Figure S1c),
and ADP had a modest eﬀect on the Kd value for the
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex relative to ATP (Supplementary
Figure S1b and S1d). The inability to observe ds9-C20
unwinding under these conditions may reﬂect a small pro-
portion of NS3 being located at the ss/ds junction.
It was possible that the observed increase in the Kd
value for the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex was due to ATP
hydrolysis. We performed three experiments to test this
possibility. First, we used the non-hydrolyzable ATP
analogue, AMPPNP. We observed a 5-fold increase in
the Kd value for the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex, suggesting
that ATP binding is suﬃcient to reduce the aﬃnity of
NS3 for ds9-C20 (Figure 1c). Second, we used an NS3
derivative that lacks ATPase activity due to a substitution
of alanine for aspartic acid at position 290 (D290A NS3).
Asp-290 is located in conserved sequence motif II (DExH)
and interacts with the divalent cation cofactor and
perhaps the water nucleophile in the triphosphate-binding
pocket/catalytic center (14). Again, ATP and AMPPNP
increased the Kd value for the NS3-D290A .ds9-C20
complex (Figure 1c). However, the extent of

that is complementary to a 9-nt RNA. The 29-nt RNA is referred to as
the loading strand because the 20-nt cytidylate tail is the site of NS3
binding. NS3 translocates in a 30!50 direction on the loading strand.
The 9-nt RNA is referred to as the displaced strand because it will be
released during the unwinding process. The substrate used for binding
measurements contains ﬂuorescein covalently linked to the 30-end of the
loading strand. (b) ds9-C20 binds to NS3 with high aﬃnity.
Fluorescein-labeled ds9-C20 was titrated with HCV NS3. Binding was
measured by monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence polarization (mP).
The data were ﬁt to a hyperbola resulting in the Kd value of
50±10nM. (c) ds9-C20 binding to NS3 is antagonized by ATP and
is independent of ATP hydrolysis. Fluorescein-labeled ds9-C20 was
incubated with increasing concentrations of either WT or D290A
HCV NS3 for 10min followed by addition of buﬀer, ATP or
AMPPNP (5mM) and incubation for an additional 1 or 10min prior
to monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence polarization (mP). The data
were analyzed as described in panel b. (d) Competitive binding assay
for ds9 in the absence and presence of ATP. Fluorescein-labeled C20
(1 nM) and competitor ds9 (0–2000 mM) was incubated with NS3 (100
nM) for 10min followed by addition of buﬀer or ATP (5mM) and
incubation for an additional 1min prior to monitoring the change in
ﬂuorescence polarization (mP). Competitive binding for ds9 was
measured by monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence polarization (mP).
The data were ﬁt to a hyperbola to determine the IC50 value for ds9.
The amplitude for ds9 is 60±10mP in the absence of ATP and
50±10mP in the presence of ATP. The Kd,i value was determined
by using the Cheng–Prusoﬀ equation (Kd,i ¼ IC501þ ½ds9C20=Kdð Þ) (37). The
Kd,i value for ds9 is 90±20 nM in the absence of ATP and
7000±2000 nM in the presence of ATP. (e) Complexes of NS3 with
ds9 and C20 are more sensitive to the presence of ATP than the
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex. The Kd values for ds9 were measured by com-
petition assay (panel d). Fluorescein-labeled C20 was titrated with HCV
NS3. Binding was measured by monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence
polarization (mP). The data were ﬁt to a hyperbola resulting in the Kd
values.

destabilization was 2-fold for NS3-D290A instead of
7-fold as observed for wild-type NS3. Finally, we per-
formed these experiments in the presence of EDTA and
observed destabilization of ds9-C20 binding to NS3
by ATP (Supplementary Figure S1b). We conclude that
ATP binding to the ATPase catalytic site causes changes
in NS3 that lead to the observed destabilization of the
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex.
NS3 equilibrates at the ss/ds junction of ds9-C20 in
the presence of ATP
In order to get a sense for where NS3 interacts with the
ds9-C20 substrate, we determined the Kd value for NS3
in complex with ds9 or C20. The C20-binding experiment
was performed with a FL-labeled oligonucleotide as
described earlier. However, the ds9-binding experiment
had to be performed by using a competition format
(‘Materials and Methods’ section and Figure 1d) because
of position-dependent changes in the Kd value measured
for diﬀerent versions of ds9-FL.
In the absence of ATP, the Kd values for complexes
of NS3 with ds9 and C20 were within 2-fold of the value
measured for ds9-C20 (Figure 1d). Therefore, the position
of NS3 relative to the junction will be heterogeneous
under conditions in which ds9-C20 is in excess of NS3.
NS3 will completely coat ds9-C20 under conditions in
which NS3 is in excess of ds9-C20.
In contrast, in the presence of ATP, the Kd value for the
NS3 .ds9 and NS3 . C20 complexes increased by 133- and
50-fold, respectively (Figure 1d). Under the same condi-
tions, the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex was only destabilized by
7-fold. Therefore, in the presence of ATP, NS3 may bind
preferentially to the ss/ds junction. Identical results were
observed in the presence of EDTA.
Binding of ds9-C20 to NS3 weakens ATP binding
In order to complete the analysis of the thermodynamics
of substrate binding to NS3, we evaluated binding of ATP
to NS3 by monitoring the quenching of the intrinsic ﬂuo-
rescence of NS3 (‘Materials and Methods’ section). ATP
(0.2–5Kd) was titrated into binding reactions containing
NS3 (2mM) in the absence or presence (20 mM) of the
ds9-C20 unwinding substrate. Relative ﬂuorescence inten-
sity was plotted as a function of ATP concentration, and
the data were ﬁt to a simple binding model (an hyperbola).
In the absence of RNA, the Kd value was 0.9±0.1mM
(Figure 2). In the presence of RNA, the Kd value increased
to 7±1mM (Figure 2). The Kd values measured by using
this direct-binding assay were substantially higher than
those inferred from kinetic data (4,7).
Slow formation of an unwinding-competent NS3 .ds9-C20
complex capable of single-step unwinding of the ds9-C20
substrate
Previous studies have shown that formation of
unwinding-competent, NS3-RNA complexes requires
incubation on the 15–60min timescale (12). Although
the physical basis for this slow activation is not known,
it is possible that this activation reﬂects melting of
basepairs at the ss/ds junction (3,5). Therefore, we
evaluated the time and temperature dependence of activa-
tion of the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex. The experimental
design is illustrated in Figure 3a. We mixed NS3 (2 mM)
with ds9-C20 (2 nM) for various amounts of time prior to
the addition of ATP (10mM). The incubation continued
for 15 s followed by quenching with EDTA (100mM),
SDS (0.33%) and trap RNA (100 nM) to prevent
reannealing of the displaced strand. Products were
resolved from substrate by using native gel electrophoresis
(Figure 3a). We chose an NS3 concentration of 2 mM
because this concentration should lead to incorporation
of at least 90% of the ds9-C20 RNA into a complex
with NS3 (Figure 1c) that is located at the ss/ds junction
in the presence of ATP (Figure 1c and d). A 10-min incu-
bation was suﬃcient to assemble active complexes on the
ds9-C20 substrate, suggesting that the kinetics of forma-
tion of an unwinding-competent, NS3-RNA complex is
dependent on the RNA substrate employed.
We observed a temperature dependence on the rate
constant for formation of activated NS3 .ds9-C20
complex as well as the amount (amplitude) of activated
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex (Figure 3a). At 37C, the half-time
for formation of activated NS3 .ds9-C20 complex was
2.3min, with maximally 85% of the ds9-C20 RNA
assembling into activated complexes (Figure 3a). At
25C, the half-time for formation of activated
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex was 9.9min, with maximally 50%
of the ds9-C20 RNA assembling into activated complexes
(Figure 3a). These data show that diﬀerences in assembly
temperature can impact the extent of unwinding.
The temperature dependence for activation of the
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex is consistent with ATP-independent
melting of the duplex leading to activation (3,5).

Figure 2. ATP binding to NS3 is antagonized by RNA. NS3 (2mM)
was incubated in the presence or absence of ds9-C20 (20 mM) for 10
min followed by addition of ATP (0–30mM). Binding was measured by
monitoring the change in relative ﬂuorescence of NS3. The excitation
wavelength was 295 nm and the emission wavelength was 333 nm. The
data were ﬁt to a hyperbola resulting in the Kd value of 0.9±0.1mM
in the absence of RNA and 7±1mM in the presence of RNA.

However, signiﬁcant melting of the duplex is unlikely as
duplexes 6–8 bp in length are not stable at 37C
(Supplementary Figure S2). We constructed a series of
modiﬁed ds9-C20 substrates in which one, two or three
adenylate residues were added to the 50-end of the
displaced strand (Figure 4a). These ‘tailed’ substrates
should mimic a pre-melted duplex and might lead to
faster activation and/or a greater yield of activated
complexes, both of which might now exhibit temperature
independence. The aﬃnity of NS3 for all of these
substrates was on par with the ds9-C20 substrate, and
the aﬃnity was modulated by ATP (Figure 4b).
However, neither the rate constant for activation nor the
amount of activated complex was impacted by addition of
the adenylate tail (Figure 4c). These data do not rule out
melting of the duplex as the phenomenon dictating
the temperature- and time-dependent activation of the
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex. They are consistent with the
‘receptacle’ for the displaced strand accommodating
more than 6 nt and a 11–18 bp unwinding super-step (8).
Given that ds9-C20 was the simplest and most eﬃcient
of the substrates tested (Figure 4 and Supplementary
Figure S3), we moved on to the evaluation of the
kinetics of unwinding by the activated NS3 .ds9-C20
complex. NS3 (2 mM) was mixed with ds9-C20 (2 nM),
incubated for 10min at 37C, rapidly mixed with ATP
(10mM) by using a chemical-quench-ﬂow apparatus,
and quenched by addition of EDTA (100mM), SDS
(0.33%) and trap RNA (100 nM). Product was again
resolved from substrate by using native PAGE
(Figure 3b).
As expected, 90% of the substrate was converted
to product over the course of the 15-s experiment
(Figure 3b). Notably, the kinetics of unwinding were
biphasic (Figure 3b). Seventy percent of the substrate
that was competent for unwinding was turned over at
a rate constant of 4±1 s1; the remainder was turned
over at a rate constant of 0.1±0.04 s1 (Figure 3b). The
population that was unwound fastest did so without
a demonstrable lag, consistent with unwinding occurring
in a single sub-step. Multiple sub-steps cannot be ruled out
unambiguously, especially if NS3 is capable of limiting the
rate of dissociation of the displaced strand. This complex
likely has at least one NS3 molecule bound to the ss/ds
junction of the ds9-C20 substrate.
The composition and organization of the population
that was unwound the slowest is not clear. This experi-
ment was performed in the presence of 10mM ATP. Our
studies have suggested that the Kd value of ATP is 7mM
for the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex (Figure 1e). Therefore,
sub-saturating concentrations of ATP may lead to forma-
tion of two kinetically distinct populations of
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex. To test this possibility, we
evaluated the ATP concentration dependence of the
unwinding kinetics for the activated NS3 .ds9-C20
complex. From 10–50mM ATP, two populations were
observed: one unwound ds9-C20 fast (2.4–6.4 s1);
the other unwound ds9-C20 slowly (0.1–0.3 s1)
(Supplementary Figure S3). At 1mM ATP, only the
slow phase was observed (Supplementary Figure S3a).
We conclude that under the conditions employed, a
value of 10mM ATP likely exceeds the Km value of
ATP for ds9-C20 unwinding. Pre-melted substrates also
exhibited biphasic kinetics of unwinding, with the fast
phase occurring at a rate constant of 3–4 s1 (Figure 4d).

Figure 3. Unwinding of ds9-C20 by NS3 is rapid. (a) Activation of the
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex for unwinding is slow and temperature depen-
dent. NS3 (2mM) was incubated with ds9-C20 (2 nM) at either 25 or
37C for various amounts of time, unwinding was initiated by addition
of ATP (10mM ﬁnal), and the reaction was quenched 15 s later by
addition of EDTA (100mM ﬁnal), SDS (0.33%) and trap RNA
(100 nM). Products of the reactions were resolved from substrates by
native PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging; representative
phosphorimages are shown. Phosphorimages were quantitated, and
the concentration of RNA unwound plotted as a function of incubation
time. The data were ﬁt to a single exponential, yielding a rate constant
for activation of NS3-RNA complexes of 0.07±0.02min1 at 25C
and 0.30±0.05min1 at 37C. The amplitudes were 1.0±0.1 and
1.7±0.1 nM at 25 and 37C, respectively. (b) Turnover of the activated
NS3 .ds9-C20 complex. Experiments were performed essentially as
described above. NS3 (2 mM) was incubated with ds9-C20 (2 nM) at
37C for 10min and prior to mixing the activated complex with
ATP. The concentration of RNA unwound was plotted as a function
of time and ﬁt to a double exponential, yielding rate constants of 4±1
and 0.1±0.01 s1. The amplitudes were 1.2±0.2 and 0.6±0.2 nM for
the fast and slow phases, respectively.

A ds9-C20-dependent burst of ATP hydrolysis in the

The observation of single-step unwinding of ds9-C20 by
NS3 prompted the evaluation of the ATPase cycle. In this
experiment, NS3 (2 mM) was mixed with ds9-C20 (20mM),
incubated for 10min at 37C, rapidly mixed with ATP
(10mM) and quenched at various times by addition of
EDTA (100mM). The conditions of this experiment
diﬀer from those above. First, ds9-C20 is now in excess
of NS3, which will favor formation of a NS3 .ds9-C20

Figure 4. The addition of single-stranded tail on the displaced strand does not enhance binding nor unwinding by HCV NS3. (a) Additional
substrates tested. The substrates (ds9-A-C20, ds9-AA-C20, ds9-AAA-C20) contain additional adenosine residues on the 50-end of the displaced
strand. The substrate used for binding measurements contains ﬂuorescein covalently linked to the 30-end of the loading strand. (b) ds9-C20 substrates
containing a 50-adenosine tail bind to NS3 as well as the tailess substrate. Fluorescein-labeled unwinding substrates were incubated with increasing
concentrations of NS3 for 1 or 10 min followed by addition of buﬀer, ATP or AMPNPP (5 mM) and incubation for an additional 1min prior to
monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence polarization (mP). The data were ﬁt to a hyperbola. The Kd values are reported. (c) Kinetics of RNA
activation of NS3-tailed-RNA complexes for unwinding is equivalent to tailess substrates. NS3 (2 mM) was incubated with unwinding substrate
(2 nM) at 37C for 10min, unwinding was initiated by addition of ATP (10mM) and the reaction was quenched 15 s later by addition of EDTA
(100mM). Products were resolved from substrates by native PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. Phosphorimages were quantitated, and the
concentration of RNA unwound plotted as a function of incubation time. The data were ﬁt to a double exponential [Equation (5)], yielding rate
constants for activation of NS3-RNA complexes. (d) The rate constant for unwinding of tailed RNAs is equivalent to tailess. NS3 (4mM) was
incubated with unwinding substrate (4 nM) at 37C for 10min then rapidly mixed with ATP (20mM) using a chemical quench-ﬂow apparatus. After
mixing, reactant concentrations were reduced by 50%. The reaction was quenched at various times by addition of EDTA (100mM ﬁnal). Products
were resolved from substrates by native PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. Phosphorimages were quantitated, and the concentration of
RNA unwound plotted as a function of incubation time. The concentration of RNA unwound was plotted as a function of time and ﬁt to a double
exponential [Equation (5)].

complex that contains an NS3 monomer. This change
was required to ensure that only the ATPase activity of
RNA-bound NS3 was monitored. Second, the concentra-
tion of ATP was reduced substantially relative to the
Kd for binding (Figure 1e) and Km for unwinding
(Supplementary Figure S3). This change was required to
ensure a signal-to-noise ratio suitable for quantitation.
ATP hydrolysis was monitored by using thin-layer chro-
matography (Figure 5a). This assay is incapable of distin-
guishing NS3-bound ADP from dissociated ADP and
provides no indication of the status of orthophosphate
(Pi)—that is, bound or free.
We observed biphasic kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. There
was a burst of ADP formation that occurred at a rate
constant of 49±12 s1 (Figure 5a) followed by a linear
accumulation of ADP at a rate of 1.2±0.1mM/s
(Figure 5a). These data suggest that release of ADP
and/or Pi is rate limiting in the steady state. Given a
burst amplitude of 0.3 mM, only 15% of the
NS3 .ds9-C20 complexes were competent for fast hydro-
lysis (Figure 5a), which could reﬂect the fraction of
complexes to which ATP was bound at 10 mM ATP.
This possibility was ruled out by the observation that a
50% reduction in the concentration of ATP employed
failed to reduce the amplitude by 50%, only the
observed rate constant for hydrolysis (Supplementary
Figure S4). We conclude that the amplitude reﬂects the
concentration of complexes competent for ATP hydrolysis
under these conditions. We used this amplitude to calcu-
late a steady-state rate constant; a value of 4 s1 was
obtained. This value is equivalent to that measured for
the fast phase of unwinding by NS3 (Figure 3b).
Interestingly, the burst of ATP hydrolysis was not
observed in the absence of RNA (Figure 5a). The
steady-state rate was the same in the presence and
absence of RNA (Figure 5a); however, this fact provides
no mechanistic insight and could be merely coincidental.
These data provide a compelling correlation between
the rate-limiting step of unwinding and a product-release
step of the ATPase cycle. We performed additional exper-
iments in the steady state to show that neither RNA con-
centration (Figure 6a) nor ATP concentration (Figure 6b)
could elevate the steady-state rate constant for ATP
hydrolysis into the realm of that observed in the
pre-steady state.
Phosphate release limits ATP turnover in the steady state
In order to determine the extent to which Pi release limited
ATP hydrolysis in the steady state, we used the
well-established assay for Pi release that is based on Pi
binding to PBP from E. coli (17). Pi binding to a PBP
modiﬁed with a coumarin-based ﬂuorescent probe leads
to a ﬂuorescence change, the kinetics of which can be
monitored in a stopped-ﬂow apparatus (‘Materials and
Methods’ section). The labeled PBP is referred to as
MDCC-PBP.
We combined NS3 (2mM) with dc9-C20 (20 mM) in a
syringe that was maintained at 37C. In a second syringe,
we combined ATP (10 mM) and MDCC-PBP (2 mM).
MDCC-PBP preparations generally contained 50%
unlabeled protein (‘Materials and Methods’ section).
We included 7-methylguanosine and purine nucleoside
phosphorylase as a ‘sponge’ for Pi in both syringes to
minimize background and maximize the observed ﬂuores-
cence change. The use of MDCC-PBP at a concentration

Figure 5. Phosphate release is the rate-limiting step for ds9-C20 unwinding by NS3. (a) ds9-C20 activates NS3-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. NS3
(4mM) was incubated in the presence (40 mM) or absence of ds9-C20 at 37C for 10min and then rapidly mixed with [a32P]-ATP (20mM) using a
chemical quench-ﬂow apparatus. The reaction was quenched at various times by addition of EDTA (100mM ﬁnal). Product (ADP) was resolved
from substrate (ATP) by TLC, visualized by phosphorimaging, and quantiﬁed. The data were ﬁt to a single exponential followed by a steady-state
resulting in a rate constant for the burst phase (kb) of 49±12 s
1 with an amplitude of 0.29±0.03 mM, and a rate for the linear phase (vss) of
1.2±0.1 mM s1. The steady-state rate constant (kss) was 4.0±0.4 s
1 and was calculated by dividing vss by the amplitude. In the absence of RNA,
the data were ﬁt to a line, yielding a rate of 1.2±0.1 mM s1. (b) Phosphate release is slower than ATP hydrolysis for the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex.
NS3 (4 mM) was incubated with ds9-C20 (40 mM), 7-methylguanosine (50mM) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (0.02 unit/ml) and then rapidly
mixed with ATP (20mM), MDCC-labeled PBP (4mM), 7-methylguanosine (250 mM) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (0.05 unit/ml) using a
stopped-ﬂow apparatus. After mixing, reactant concentrations were reduced by 50%. The release of Pi from the NS .ds9-C20 .ADP .Pi complex was
monitored by the increase in ﬂuorescence intensity of PBP caused by Pi binding. The data were ﬁt to a single exponential. This experiment was
repeated seven diﬀerent times under a variety of conditions yielding a rate constant of 5.3±0.6 s1 for phosphate release.

sub-stoichiometric to NS3 was to ensure that we moni-
tored only one round of Pi release, permitting the rate
constant to be determined by a single exponential ﬁt of
the data. Upon mixing, an exponential increase in ﬂuores-
cence was observed that ﬁt nicely to a single exponential
rise (Figure 5b). The observed rate constant was
5.3±0.6 s1, a value within error of both the steady-state
rate constant for the ATPase cycle (Figure 5a) and the fast
rate constant for ds9-C20 unwinding (Figure 3b).
Reduction of the MDCC-PBP concentration to 1 mM
did not cause a signiﬁcant change in the observed rate
constant for Pi release. When MDCC-PBP was present
in excess, a linear change in ﬂuorescence was observed
from which calculation of a rate constant proved too
unreliable. We conclude that Pi release is the rate-limiting
step for the ATPase cycle of the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex.
From these experiments, it is clear that ADP release
cannot occur slower than Pi release. However, we
cannot exclude the possibility that product release is
random with both ADP and Pi release occurring at the
same rate. Also, we cannot formally exclude the possibility
that steps after ADP/Pi dissociation, such as binding of a
second ATP molecule, do not contribute to the observed
unwinding.
DISCUSSION
RNA helicases use chemical energy stored in the
phosphoanhydride bond of ATP to perform mechanical
work of RNA unwinding. How this happens is not clear.
It is now known that despite an apparent large kinetic and
physical step size for the NS3 helicase, unwinding requires
sub-steps and perhaps sub-sub-steps (4,6). The smallest
step is linked to hydrolysis of a single ATP (4,6).
Whether this translates to 1-bp (4) or 3-bp (6) unwound
still needs to be clariﬁed.
This study was initiated at a time when the prevailing
thought was that the enzyme translocated in 3-bp
sub-steps (6). We therefore assumed that at 37C, an
unwinding substrate of 9-bp might require only a single
sub-step for unwinding, especially given the reports of
local melting of the duplex occurring after NS3 binding
to the unwinding substrate (5). Unwinding of the ds9-C20
substrate employed here seems to function as expected,
employing the mechanism shown in Figure 7.
NS3 binds to the unwinding substrate and slowly trans-
forms into a complex competent for unwinding (Figure 7)
(12). This isomerization may lead to local melting of the
duplex as the rate constant for activation is temperature
dependent (Figure 3a). Whether or not the melting is at
the ss/ds junction (5) or within the duplex (3) is not
known. However, an unwinding substrate with a
pre-frayed end does not exhibit enhanced kinetics of
unwinding (Figure 4c).
Next, ATP binds to the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex. Our
study suggests that nucleic acid causes an 8-fold
decrease in the aﬃnity of NS3 for ATP (Figure 2).
Reduced aﬃnity for ATP in the presence of nucleic acid
has been documented in the past for both full-length and
truncated (NS3h) form of NS3 (7,23). However, an
increase in aﬃnity has also been reported for full-length
NS3 (24). All of these studies inferred aﬃnity from
kinetic studies of the ATPase activity. This study
employed a direct approach. While NS3-ATP and
NS3 .ds9-C20-ATP complexes show a change in intrinsic
ﬂuorescence relative to NS3 and NS3 .ds9-C20, respec-
tively, the same was not true for NS3h (25). Therefore,
it is not absolutely clear that the site monitored by our
studies represents the ATPase catalytic center. There has
been some suggestion that NS3 has two ATP-binding
sites, one of which could be remote from the catalytic
site (25). The Kd value for ATP reported here is in the
1–7mM range (Figure 2). Values obtained by others in
the presence of RNA were: 25 mM (24), 0.5mM (7) and
3.4–4.6mM (23).

Binding of ATP to NS3 dramatically decreases the
aﬃnity of NS3 for RNA (Figure 1). Binding to ss/ds
junction is aﬀected less than binding to ds or ss RNA
(Figure 1). This observation raises the important
question: how does NS3 bind to RNA in the cell where
concentrations of ATP likely exceed that of viral (and
cellular) RNA? Binding of NS3 to RNA, especially viral
RNA, may be facilitated by interactions with other viral
proteins, such as NS5A or NS5B, that bind to viral RNA
speciﬁcally and independently of ATP (10,26,27). Clearly,
binding of NS3 to cellular RNA is not advantageous to
the cell as the unwinding activity could lead to RNA
remodeling and the ATPase activity could lead to ATP
depletion. Our observations of the antagonistic eﬀect of
ATP binding on RNA binding and vice versa may explain
the observation that expression of NS3 is not toxic to cells
(16,28–30).
Very limited information is available on the kinetics of
ATP binding and dissociation. One study of NS3h sug-
gested that the second-order rate constant for ATP
binding to NS3h-RNA is 0.4mM1 s1, three orders of
magnitude slower than the second-order rate constant
for RNA binding to NS3h (7). A study of NS3 suggested
that the second-order rate constant for ATP binding to a
paused NS3-RNA complex is 9.9mM1 s1 (23). Given
the uncertainty and extremes of the values for the rate
constants for association and dissociation of ATP, as
well as equilibrium dissociation constant for ATP, the
ATP concentration employed in any experiment could
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence experimental outcome. For
example, if the second-order rate constant is 9.9mM1
s1, then at 1mM, any process occurring faster than
2 s1 will be attenuated by binding and may not be
observed.
Addition of ATP to the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex led to
unwinding that was dependent on ATP concentration. At
1mM ATP, incomplete unwinding was predicted; the
observed rate constant was 0.1 s1 (Figure S3). However,
at 10mM ATP, essentially all of the RNA was unwound.
The kinetics of unwinding were biphasic. The rate
constant for the ﬁrst phase (70%) was 4 s1; the rate
constant for the second phase (30%) was 0.1 s1
(Figure 3b). The rate constant of 4 s1 correlates to an
unwinding rate that is consistent with our previous
studies (20). However, displacement rate constants this
fast have never been observed in ensemble experiments,
only single-molecule experiments (4,6).
The reasons for the two rate constants observed for
unwinding of the ds9-C20 substrate are not clear. It is
possible that the organization of the NS3 .ds9-C20
complex relative to the junction is diﬀerent or the extent
of activation is diﬀerent (e.g. extent of duplex melting).
Pyle has suggested that the use of a complementary trap
for the displaced strand could artiﬁcially increase the burst
amplitude (and perhaps rate) (8). This eﬀect of trap was
not observed in our system (Supplementary Figure S5a),
consistent with the observed dependence of the amplitude
of unwinding on ATP concentration (Supplementary
Figure S3).
The existence of NS3-RNA complex capable of fast
unwinding provides new opportunities for ensemble
experiments to contribute to our understanding of
helicase mechanism. The kinetics of the fast phase does
not exhibit a lag, suggesting that a single step is suﬃcient
for unwinding and that if sub- or sub-sub-steps are
involved, then the rate constant(s) must be greater than
40 s1 for this substrate; rate constants that are sub-
stantially faster than predicted by single-molecule experi-
ments (4,6).
The possibility that one step was suﬃcient for unwind-
ing encouraged evaluation of the ATPase cycle. Under the
conditions employed, the steady-state rate constant for
the ATPase cycle of the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex was
also 4 s1 (Figures 3b and 6, and Supplementary
Figure S4). The pre-steady-state rate constant for ATP
hydrolysis by the NS3 .ds9-C20 complex was 49 s1

Figure 7. Integrating the ATPase cycle into models for RNA unwind-
ing by HCV NS3. This model was adapted from that presented recently
by Myong et al. (6). Domains 1 and 2 together constitute the
ATP-binding and ATPase sites and are colored blue and green, respec-
tively. The ‘receptacle’ (8) for displaced RNA is colored yellow. NS3
binds to both the ss and ds regions of the unwinding substrate;
however, there is a preference for the ss/ds junction. A time- and
temperature-dependent activation of the NS3-RNA complex occurs
after RNA binding to NS3. This activation may reﬂect an
ATP-independent fraying of the duplex. Binding of ATP, and ATP
hydrolysis lead to closing of domains 1 and 2 and translocation by
3 bp on loading strand, creating a high energy NS3-RNA complex.
Phosphate dissociation releases the strain by permitting movement of
the receptacle and unwinding of the next 3 bp. The system would now
be reset for another cycle of unwinding. With the ds9-C20 substrate,
one cycle of unwinding is followed by spontaneous melting of the
duplex, thus preventing the need for additional rounds of
ATP-dependent unwinding. We conclude that Pi release drives the
power stroke for unwinding by NS3.
1322 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 4
using 10 mM ATP (Figure 5a). These data suggest that
ATP hydrolysis is faster than release of ADP or Pi.
The ability to observe a burst at 10 mM ATP would
argue that the second order rate constant is
>4 mM1 s1. It is important to note that very little
unwinding is observed under conditions employed for
pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the ATPase cycle.
This observation is not explained by the presence of
inactive enzyme in our preparations (Supplementary
Figure S5b). Caution is clearly warranted in the inter-
pretation of the ATPase cycle relative to the unwinding
cycle. However, these data suggested that ATP hydrolysis
is unlikely to be the rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle
in the presence of nucleic acid.
Release of phosphate was measured by using PBP and
the rate constant was 5 s1 (Figure 5b). Taken at face
value, these data suggest that any reiterative process
coupled to the ATPase cycle would be limited by phos-
phate release. Phosphate release was recently found to
limit the ssDNA-stimulated TTPase cycle for the
ring-shaped T7 helicase (13). We have reached the same
conclusion for the ssRNA-stimulated ATPase cycle of
NS3 (Wang et al., in preparation). The data also suggest
that our unwinding substrate is unwound in one cycle of
ATP hydrolysis. It is unlikely that unwinding 1 bp would
be suﬃcient, so these data are most consistent with a 3-bp
sub-step per ATP hydrolyzed, although binding, hydroly-
sis and phosphate release may act independently to
translocate the enzyme through 1-bp sub-sub-steps.
Under the conditions used, melting of 3 bp would be suf-
ﬁcient to prevent hybridization at 37C (Supplementary
Figure S2b). DEAD-box proteins can melt multiple
basepairs by using a single ATP without the requirement
for hydrolysis (31–33). Hydrolysis in this case permits
enzyme turnover (32).
The stoichiometry of ATP bound per bp unwound is, at
best, inferred by all experiments performed on NS3
unwinding, including this study. However, phosphate
release as a rate-limiting step would predict a pause
between every round of ATP hydrolysis as has been
observed in single molecule force experiments and
ensemble experiments (4,9). Indeed, in these studies,
release of the paused NS3-RNA complex depended on a
ﬁrst order rate constant of 2–5 s1 (4,9), which is clearly
on the same order of magnitude as the rate constant for
phosphate release determined here. Single molecule FRET
experiments also suggest that 3-bp steps are limited by a
rate constant of 1 s1 (6).
We propose that phosphate release contributes to the
release of the ‘spring’ that moves NS3 by one sub-step.
Phosphate release is the signal for conformational changes
required for function in a variety of systems, from
cytoskeletal motor proteins (34) to translation factors
(35). The substrate described here is well suited to
explore this possibility more deeply for the NS3 helicase
by using ensemble experiments. In addition, the approach
described here for NS3 should illuminate mechanisms for
other DExH-box RNA helicases and may also permit
direct comparison of this class of helicases to the
DEAD-box class of enzymes (31–33,36).
