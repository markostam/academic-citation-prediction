Abstract
The nucleus ventrolateralis thalami (VLT) in pigeons receives direct retinal and forebrain projections and has reciprocal connections with
the optic tectum. Although VLT is a component of the avian visual system, no study directly examined its connections or its cellular response
characteristics. We, therefore, recorded from single units in the pigeon’s VLT while visually stimulating the ipsi- and/or contralateral eye. In

dddition, tracing experiments were conducted to investigate its afferent connections. Electrophysiologically, we discovered three types of neurons,
wo of which were probably activated via a top-down telencephalotectal system (latencies > 100 ms). Type I neurons responded to uni- and bilateral
nd type II neurons exclusively to bilateral stimulation. Type III neurons were probably activated by retinal or retinotectal input (latencies < 27 ms)
nd responded to contra- and bilateral stimulation. Retrograde tracer injections into the VLT revealed an ipsilateral forebrain input from the visual
ulst, from subregions of the arcopallium, and bilateral afferents from the optic tectum. Most intriguing was the direct connection between the
LTs of both hemispheres. We suggest that the avian VLT is part of a system that integrates visuomotor processes which are controlled by both
orebrain hemispheres and that VLT contributes to descending tectomotor mechanisms.

. Introduction
Visual information in birds is processed in parallel by the
halamo- and the tectofugal pathways which are equivalent to the
ammalian geniculo-cortical and extrageniculo-cortical visual
ystems, respectively [41]. The thalamofugal pathway transfers
etinal input to the contralateral thalamic nucleus geniculatus
ateralis, pars dorsalis (GLd), which projects bilaterally to the
isual Wulst of the forebrain [6]. The tectofugal pathway con-
ists of retinal projections to the contralateral optic tectum (OT),
rom which fibers lead bilaterally to the nucleus rotundus (Rt),
hich then exclusively projects to the ipsilateral entopallium in
he forebrain ([11,17,26]; terminology according to [33]). Due
o the virtually complete decussation of the bird’s optic nerves
nd the small amount of recrossings in the ascending pathways,

each hemisphere receives information almost exclusively from
the contralateral eye. Consequently, there is a strong need for
interhemispheric integration of visual information from both
eyes. Apart from the ascending systems, several further systems
enable interhemispheric communication, like the tectotectal
commissures, or the bilateral descending Wulst-tectum connec-
tions, which additionally serve as an important link between
thalamo- and tectofugal systems [1,2,3,13,29]. The presence
of bilateral connections of the pretectal nuclei [7,41,42] or the
isthmic nucleus semilunaris [19] suggests modulatory visual
nuclei to also play a critical role in interhemispheric communi-
cation.
The nucleus ventrolateralis thalami (VLT) is another good
candidate for an interhemispheric integration of visual informa-
tion. Although several studies refer to VLT as a distinct thalamic
nucleus (Rendahl [35], who labeled it n. superficialis internus)
[25,27,28,36,39], VLT has never been the focus of detailed
investigations. As a side product of tracer injections, several
studies have shown that VLT receives direct retinal projec-
tions [10,24,32,39,40], has bilateral and reciprocal connections361-9230/$ – see front matter © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

with the optic tectum [4,21,22] and receives efferents from the
visual Wulst [5,30,31,43]. However, no study has attempted to
study directly the connections of VLT by tracer injections. Sim-
ilarly, response characteristics of VLT neurons have never been
studied. In this study, we combined for the first time electro-
physiological recordings and anatomical tracing techniques to
characterize this ‘uncharted’ thalamic structure and provide a
first basis for speculations about its functional role in avian visual
information processing.

2.1. Animals
The original research reported herein was performed according to the princi-
ples regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures adopted
by the National Institutes of Health Guide, the Society for Neuroscience and

elty to animals. The successful cases totaled seven adult naı¨ve homing pigeons
(Columba livia) of both sexes which were obtained from local breeders in Ger-
many.

2.2.2. Data analysis
Peri stimulus time histograms (PSTHs, 5 ms bin width) were calculated for
each experimental condition. Neuronal activity was analyzed over a 250 ms
interval after stimulus onset, since all isolated neurons responded exclusively to
stimulus onset. Stimulus onset was defined as the point in time after opening
of the shutter when luminance had reached 10% of its maximum. Spontaneous
activity during control conditions was calculated within a 250 ms time interval.
T-tests for dependent samples confirmed the statistical significance of responses
to visual stimulation versus spontaneous activity for each isolated single unit.
Normalized PSTHs were calculated for each unit by dividing the number of
spikes in each bin by the maximal number of spikes, resulting in bin values
between 0 and 1. Response latency was calculated as the lower time limit of two
consecutive bins with normalized activity values of at least 0.33. Response offset
was defined as the upper time limit of the first bin followed by two bins below
the threshold of 0.33. Response duration was calculated as the time between
response on- and offset. Peak activity strength was calculated by averaging
the discharge rate (spikes/s) during the interval of significant spiking activ-
ity, as defined by response latency and duration. Finally, Friedman ANOVAs
and Wilcoxon matched pairs tests were used to test for differences in response
latency, peak activity strength and response duration within classes of neurons
between different stimulus conditions. Mann–Whitney U tests were performed
to test for differences between different classes of neurons.
2.2.3. Tracing experiments
Tracing experiments were performed in two adult pigeons with choler-
atoxin subunit B (CtB; Sigma). Pigeons were anesthetized with equithesin
(0.31 ml/100 g, i.m.) and a glass micropipette (outer tip diameter 20m) was
stereotaxically placed into the left VLT (A7.0, L3.0, D5.0, coordinates based
on Karten and Hodos [25]). Thirty to forty nanoliters of CtB solution (1%,
w/v in distilled water) were pressure-injected (Nanoliterinjector, WPI) over a

Tnimals were anesthetized with 25% urethane (1 ml/100 g, i.m.) and the brain
as exposed above the target area. Electrodes were placed stereotaxically at a
0◦ angle (45◦ upwards relative to the pigeon atlas by Karten and Hodos [25]).
he eyelids of both eyes were kept open with adhesive tape. Light-conducting
culars connected to a halogen light (luminance: 40 or 900 cd/m2; background
llumination: 5 lux) were placed in front of the eyes to present diffuse light
timuli to the whole visual field of each retina. They were arranged in an
ngle of 60◦ to the left and right from midline, corresponding to the optical
xis. This guaranteed that light was transferred only to the appropriate eye.
echanical shutters (rise/fall times 27 ms each) were used to control stimulus
resentation (500 ms) to the left and/or right eye. The interstimulus-interval was
s. Data acquisition started 100 ms before stimulus onset, which was defined
s the point in time when luminance had reached 10% of its maximum. Four
ifferent stimulus conditions were tested: monocular stimulation of the eye
ither ipsilateral or contralateral to the recording site, simultaneous stimulation
f both eyes and a control condition without stimulation.
Extracellular single cell responses were recorded from the right and the left
LT with single platinum–iridium electrodes (0.5–1 M) or a multielectrode
rray (Thomas Recording, Giessen, Germany) of seven concentrically arranged
lectrodes (0.2–2.1 M) using standard techniques described in detail in Folta et
l. [13]. Neuronal signals were amplified (×104) and filtered (0.3–10 kHz). Sin-
le units responding to visual stimulation were recorded at depths between 9000
nd 11,000m, stored and further isolated off-line by means of spike sorting
nd cluster cutting (EWB, DataWave Technologies; Spike 2, CED, Cambridge).
For histological verification of the recording sites, electrolytic lesions were
laced at the end of each experiment at defined coordinates within the recording
rea with a steel electrode for the Prussian blue reaction ([14,15]; see meth-
ds in [13]). Animals were then perfused transcardially with saline and a 4%
araformaldehyde plus 15% potassium ferricyanide solution in 0.12 M phos-
hate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were sagittally cut at 40m and brain sections were
rocessed with standard histological methods.
Electrode tracts were verified in Nissl stained parasagittal brain sections
nd by lesion marks from the Prussian blue reaction. We carefully checked that
xtensions of electrode tracks passed directly through VLT and not through
djacent visual areas, such as n. rotundus, which is located more posterior to
LT. The coordinates of all electrode penetrations and the depths of recording
ites relative to the lesions marks allowed a good reconstruction of the location
f all recorded neurons.0 min period. After 2 days of survival, pigeons were anesthetized and per-
used as described above (without the supplement of potassium ferricyanide).
rains were cut in frontal plane at 40m and collected in phosphate buffer con-
aining 0.1% sodium azide (w/v). Brain slices were reacted free-floating with
he immuno-ABC-technique as outlined in detail by Hellmann and Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n
18]. The tracer injection sites and resulting retrograde CtB-labeling were recon-
tructed using a Leica DMR microscope. Digital images were processed with the
XIOVISION 3.0 software (Zeiss, FRG). Contrast and brightness were adjusted
ith Photoshop software (Adobe, Mountain View, CA).
. Results
.1. Identiﬁcation of recording positions
We isolated 18 neurons within VLT, which showed a sig-
ificant visual response in at least one of the three stimulation
onditions as compared to spontaneous cell activity (T-tests).
he location of ‘Prussian blue’ marks and the careful recon-
truction of the electrode tracks confirmed that all recording
ites were located within VLT and not in surrounding nuclei or
ber structures (Fig. 1).
.2. Analysis of recorded cell responses
We classified all recorded neurons into three distinct groups
ased on their response characteristics (Table 1). Type I neurons
n = 5) were characterized by a short burst (10–30 ms duration)
fter contra-, ipsi- and bilateral stimulation of the eyes (Fig. 2).
esponse latencies differed significantly between the three stim-
lation conditions (Friedman ANOVA, χ2 = 8.44, n = 5, d.f. = 2,
< 0.015). Latencies were similar for contra- and ipsilateral
isual input (averaging at 115.0 and 116.0 ms, respectively,
able 1), but were significantly longer for binocular stimulation

for both bino-monocular comparisons). Response durations var-
ied also significantly depending on the stimulation condition
(Friedman ANOVA, χ2 = 8.44, n = 5, d.f. = 2, p < 0.015). They
were comparable in response to contra- and ipsilateral visual
input (Z = 0.535, p < 0.593) with shorter responses to binocularly
presented stimuli (mean: 13 ms) compared to monocular visual
stimulation (contralateral: 22 ms; ipsilateral: 23 ms; Z = 2.023,
p < 0.043 for both tests). Peak activity strength differed sig-
nificantly between the three stimulation conditions (Friedman
ANOVA, χ2 = 7.6, n = 5, d.f. = 2, p < 0.022). It was similar
after ipsi- and contralateral stimulation (90.8 and 84.0 spikes/s,
respectively) but showed a significant difference to binocularly
presented stimuli (132.7 spikes/s) compared to each monocular
stimulation condition (Z = 2.023; p < 0.043 for both tests).
Type II neurons (n = 5) only responded to binocularly pre-

binocular stimulus.
Type III neurons (n = 8) responded to contralateral and to
binocular stimulation (Fig. 2). The response latencies were
26.7 ms for stimulation of the contralateral and 25.7 ms for
stimulation of both eyes. The duration of the responses were
23.1 (contralateral) and 25.0 (bilateral); peak activity strength
was 149.5 and 135.8 spikes/s, contra- and bilateral, respectively.
Wilcoxon tests did not show differences in latencies, duration
and peak activity strength between the contra- and bilateral stim-
ulation (Z > 1.26, n.s. for all tests).
Comparisons between these three types of neurons revealed
that responses of type II cells to a bilateral visual stimulus
occurred significantly earlier and lasted significantly longer than
those of type I cells (Mann–Whitney U tests; Z = 2.61, p < 0.008,
for both tests), but there was no significant difference in peak
activity strength (Z = 1.57, p < 0.151). Considering that laten-
cies of type I cells were shortest in response to an ipsilateral
visual stimulus, we compared the latencies of type II cells under
binocular visual stimulus conditions to the shortest latencies of
type I cells, i.e. under ipsilateral stimulation conditions. Even
in this case, latencies of type II cells were significantly shorter
than the shortest latencies of type I cells (Z = 2.61, p < 0.008).
Also, response durations to bilateral stimulation were signifi-
cantly longer in type II cells as compared to the longest response
durations of type I cells, which occurred under ipsilateral stim-

for contralateral stimulation (Z = 2.35, p < 0.05). In the bilateral
stimulation condition type III and type I neurons differed signifi-
cantly in latency (Z = 3.01,p < 0.05), duration (Z = 2.99,p < 0.05)
and in peak activity strength (Z = 2.34, p < 0.05). These analyses
show that type III neurons responded significantly earlier than
type I and type II neurons. Furthermore, the duration of type III
neuron responses was shorter and the peak activity strength was
higher than type II neurons (bilateral stimulation). The response
duration of type I neurons was shorter for bilateral stimulation
and the peak activity strength was lower for contralateral stim-
ulation compared to type III neurons.
3.3. Analysis of CtB injections
Two adult pigeons received injections of the neuronal tracer
CtB into the left VLT. In both cases, CtB injections resulted in a
complex retrograde labeling pattern within the left diencephalon
(Table 2). The reconstruction of the injection sites revealed that
tracer spread was almost completely restricted to the area of
the VLT with a small spread into the lateral forebrain bundle
but did not include Rt, n. geniculatus lateralis, pars ventralis
(GLv), or optic tract (Fig. 3A). We observed labeled cells in
several surrounding structures of VLT and in subnuclei of the
pigeon’s GLd. Since it cannot be excluded that these cell label-
ings resulted from tracer spread into surrounding structures or
penetration of the injection cannula into the fasciculus prosen-

ignificant difference in peak activity strength when comparing
he bilateral responses of type II cells with ipsilateral (Z = 0.63,
.s.) or contralateral responses (Z = 0.0, n.s.) of type I cells.
Comparing the responses of type III and type I neurons for
ontra- and bilateral stimulation Mann–Whitney U tests showed
ifferences in latencies (contralateral: Z = 3.06, p < 0.05; bilat-
ral: Z = 3.08, p < 0.05), in duration only for binocular stim-
lation (Z = 2.79, p < 0.05) and in peak activity strength onlyephali lateralis (FPL) in the case of the GLd, they were not listed

Overall, the labeling pattern was consistent and unambiguous
for the two cases (Table 2). Retrograde CtB transport resulted
in bilateral labeling of tectal neurons predominantly located
within the ventrolateral tectum (Fig. 3E–G). Two cellular popu-
lations could be distinguished by their laminar distribution and
their dendritic arborization pattern. Cells within the superficial
layers 4–11 were confined to the lateral portion of the ipsi-
lateral tectum (Fig. 3E). Layers 10 and 11 contained mainly
small and medium sized radial cells. The apical dendrites of
290 M. Schulte et al. / Brain Research Bulletin 68 (2006) 285–292
these cells ascended to superficial tectal layers up to layer 5,
but mostly terminated in layer 7, where they showed massive
dendritic arborizations (Fig. 3G). Only few small labeled cells
were observed in retinorecipient tectal layers 4 and 6. Labeled
cells within the deeper layers 13–15 could be predominantly
detected within the ventrolateral portion of the tectum. While
cells located contralaterally to the injection side were confined to
the superficial part of the ventral layer 13 (Fig. 3F), ipsilaterally
projecting cells were located within laminae 13–15 (Fig. 3E).
These cells were mainly multipolar, characterized by different
size and shape and were mostly concentrated at the superficial
border to layer 12. Dendritic arborizations could not be detected
higher than up to layer 12. Thus, this deep population resembles
cells of the descending tectal output [20]. Moreover, massive
labeling of multipolar cells was observed mainly in the ventral
part of the ipsilateral nucleus isthmi, pars semilunaris (SLu, A
1.75–A 2.25; Fig. 4).
In addition, we identified a telencephalic labeling in the ipsi-
lateral visual Wulst (Fig. 3C) and the ipsilateral arcopallium
(Fig. 3D). CtB-labeled cells in HA were widely distributed
(A 7.5–A 9.5) and extended laterally up to the area temporo-
parieto-occipitalis (TPO). A strikingly dense cluster of ipsilat-
erally labeled cells were also obtained in the outermost medial
parts of the arcopallium dorsale (AD). According to the atlas of
Karten and Hodos [25], these cells were distributed between A
6.25 and A 7.25. Furthermore, we observed clusters of labeled

4. Discussion
The present study provides the first evidence for both the
existence of visually responsive units in the VLT along with
anatomical results on the afferent connectivity of this uncharted
territory of the avian diencephalon. Although our sample is
small, it is important to emphasize the difficulty to inject into
or record from such a tiny nucleus at the ventral base of the
diencephalon. Our combined electrophysiological and anatom-
ical data reveal that VLT could play a key role in the integra-
tion of visual information from both sides of the visual system
(Fig. 5).
4.1. Response characteristics of VLT neurons
Our single unit recordings clearly show that VLT units are
visually responsive. Since VLT receives direct retinal [32] and
tectal input [21], all reported type III cells with short latencies of
about 26 ms probably reflect bottom-up processing via a direct
retinal or an indirect retinotectal path. Type I and type II cells
had considerably longer latencies of more than 80 ms and could

plane. To avoid confusion, only a part of the connectivity of the VLT of one
hemisphere is shown. Different tectal shadings correspond to the retinorecipient
layers 2–7 (light grey) and intermediate as well as deep layers 8–15 (dark grey).
Within the tectum two cardinal neurons are shown. The one within the retinore-
cipient layers has narrow dendritic fields and ipsilateral projections to VLT. The
deep tectal neurons with wide dendritic endings have bilateral VLT-projections.

.25 and A 7.0. Only few cells were labeled in the arcopal-
ium mediale (AM) and were concentrated mainly at A 6.5
Fig. 3D).
CtB injections also revealed retrogradely labeled multipolar
eurons within the contralateral VLT (A 7.0–A 7.5), indicating
direct interthalamic connection between the ventrolateral tha-
ami of the left and the right half brain (Fig. 3A and B). The
ells displayed dendrites reaching ventrally into GLv and dor-
ally into the nucleus marginalis tractus optici (nMOT) while

reflect activity patterns of a top-down pathway. Indeed, Folta
et al. [13] revealed rotundal cells with similarly long latencies
that were selectively affected by an inactivation of the visual
Wulst. Because the rotundus receives no direct projection from
the visual Wulst but indirect ones via the tectum, the similar-
ity of long response latencies in VLT and rotundus suggests
that most of the late VLT responses might be attributable to
a telencephalo-tecto-VLT transmission. The latency difference
between unilateral and bilateral stimulation in type I cells might
then be due to different intratectal mechanisms mediating either
uniocular or binocular input. This assumption is strengthened
by the observation that the higher peak activity strength after
binocular than after monocular stimulation does not reflect a
simple summation.
All recorded neurons were responsive to photic stimulation
of both eyes. Type II cells even required simultaneous input
from both eyes. The responses of type III neurons to bilateral
stimulation did not differ from the responses to contralateral
stimulation and therefore are most likely evoked only by the
contralateral eye. Thus, at least the forebrain-mediated activation
patterns of VLT seem to compute visual events within both visual

very late responses from both eyes. Thus, as outlined above,
we suggest that the observed response profile of type I and
type II neurons within the VLT result from a bilateral TSM-
and TOM-mediated top-down activation of deep tectal lay-
ers that subsequently ignite tectal neurons with indirect retinal
access.
The projections of VLT provide input to the contralateral VLT
(present study) and to tectal layers 11–14 [21] on the ipsilateral
side. Thus, VLT neurons not only modulate their counterparts
in the contralateral halfbrain but also tectal cells in those layers
from which they receive their input (Fig. 5). These deep tectal
laminae are in part the source of the diverse descending tec-
tomotor output pathways [20]. Since VLT neurons are partly
GABAergic [9], this diencephalic structure could inhibit some
tectal circuits while activating others.
4.3. VLT functions in visual processing
The data presented in the present study in conjunction with
information from the literature could provide a framework for a
tentative interpretation of the function of VLT. First of all, our
anatomical results show tectal afferents to VLT to mainly arise
from the lateral tectum. Since the lateral tectum represents the
central fovea which points into the lateral field of view [34],
bilateral visual information within VLT mainly arises from non-
overlapping parts of the visual field perceived by the two eyes.

fisual Wulst as well as from the arcopallial subfields AD,
I and AM. The Wulst projections were possibly mediated
y the tractus septomesencephalicus (TSM) [31], while those
rom the arcopallium very likely ran through the tractus occip-
tomesencephalicus (TOM) [8] (Fig. 4). The visual Wulst is
he primary telencephalic representation of the thalamofugal
ystem [37]. The arcopallium receives visual input via both
he entopallium [23] and a small projection from the Wulst
38]. Consequently, photic eye stimulations produce arcopal-
ial responses with latencies of 40 ms [44]. Thus, forebrain
fferents of VLT integrate thalamo- and tectofugal streams of
rocessing. The tectofugal component is further substantiated
y the afferents of the VLT from midbrain SLu, that is know
o be a modulatory component of the tectorotundal stream
19].
Our anatomical data reveal a bilateral input from the optic
ectum onto VLT. While the ipsilateral afferents also involved
nput from superficial retinorecipient layers, those from the
ontralateral side only came from deep laminae that are also
nvolved in bilateral projections onto the rotundus [17]. Tec-
orotundal neurons can be subdivided into at least five sub-
ypes receiving direct or only indirect retinal input due to
heir dendritic lamination pattern within or below the termi-
ation zone of retinal ganglion cells, respectively [18]. While
he majority of cells have direct access to retinal input, one
ubtype displays dendrites that do not ramify within the retinore-
ipient layers. Since the dendrites of the ipsi- and the con-
ralateral tectal input to the VLT are likewise confined to the
eep layers, they presumably belong to that ascending popula-
ion which processes indirect visual and/or multimodal infor-
ation. Accordingly, our stimulation paradigm only revealedigeons that fixate stimuli with their left or their right lateral
isual field often subsequently make a head or body movement
o this target [12]. The descending telencephalotectal projections
ia TSM and TOM play a key role in mediating this decision
o move either to the left or to the right [16]. In both cases,
isuomotor systems in both halfbrains have to be coordinated.
ccordingly, the physiological properties of both types of VLT
ells make a bihemispheric gating function likely. Type I neu-
ons were activated by both left and right eye stimulation, but
ilateral stimulation caused a critical time shift in their neu-
onal responses. Type II neurons completely ignored unilateral
timuli but only responded to the bilateral flash. Thus, the VLT
utput to deep tectal layers required a bilateral activation of
he telencephalo-tecto-VLT system. With their bilateral integra-
ion of the tecto- and thalamofugal system and their projections
nto the deep tectal layers, VLT neurons could play a role in
his bilateral visuomotor control. Obviously, this interpretation
f the function of VLT is presently speculative and in need of
nformation on more critical details. However, if it explains at
east some functions of this thalamic structure, the bilateral inte-
ration at the level of VLT indeed would be part of a system
hat coordinates visuomotor behavior that is controlled by fore-
rain circuits of both hemispheres and is executed by tectomotor
echanisms.
