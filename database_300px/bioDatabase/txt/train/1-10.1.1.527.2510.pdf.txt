Abstract 
 
The performance of field test stakes derived from commercially produced 
ground contact retention copper quat preservatives based on either soluble 
copper complexed with ethanolamine, or from a water-based suspension of 
particulate micronized copper compounds, as well as untreated southern 
yellow pine controls, is compared at two decay test sites.  After less than one 
year in field test some of the untreated controls at both test sites showed 
severe fungal deterioration.  Stakes treated with the soluble copper 
preservative are unattacked, while those treated with the particulate 
micronized copper preservative are showing varying degrees of decay, which 
in some cases is severe or complete.  Possible reasons for the performance 
differences observed are discussed.

Introduction 
 
Wood preservatives based on copper have had a long history of commercial 
use (Nicholas et al 1997).  Three general types of product can be recognized, 
the systems containing chromium as a corrosion inhibitor, fixation agent and 
co-biocide, as exemplified by chromated copper arsenate (CCA), the copper 
complexes such as copper naphthenate, and the water-based copper 
preservative systems containing a nitrogen base as a solubilizer, fixation 
agent and corrosion inhibitor, as in the case of ammoniacal copper arsenate 
(ACA), ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA), ammoniacal copper citrate, 
copper azole (CA), copper HDO and alkaline copper quat (ACQ).   These 
latter systems used ammonia or amines to solubilize and stabilize the copper 
in solution and to provide penetration throughout the wood structure and 
 3
interactions with the wood components.  Such systems have been used since 
the mid-1930s in the United States.  The active copper components of such 
systems provide most of the performance characteristics of the preservatives, 
with the secondary biocides being important in protecting the treated wood 
against some copper tolerant fungi, and also to some degree against termites.  
While “fixed” to a large degree within the wood structure, the highly fungicidal 
alkaline copper component appears to retain some degree of mobility which 
leads to some increase in corrosion profile with some fasteners, and also a 
non-zero leaching profile (Zhang, 2000).   Long term field and service 
performance of such alkaline copper preservatives in in-ground applications 
has been excellent. 
 
In recent years several products have been developed which use the same 
copper and co-biocide components as some of the alkaline copper systems 
mentioned above, but use solid particulate copper compounds (usually copper 
carbonate) suspended in water rather than the water soluble copper 
complexes based on copper and amine or ammonia.  Initial reports in the 
patent literature suggest such developments first occurred during 2001.  The 
patent literature also suggests that particle size of the “micronized” copper 
component is important, and a mean particle size in the region of 190 nm is 
described as being optimal.  Smaller size would increase leachability and 
potentially bring health issues related to nano-particles, while larger particle 
sizes would be detrimental to the treatment of even the highly permeable pine 
species which are currently practicable to treat. 
 
Examples of such products appeared on the market in 2006 but little long 
term technical information was publicly available on such products.  Currently, 
there are no scientific publications that include long term field stake data for 
the micronized copper preservative systems.  Two papers at the IRG meeting 
in 2007 looked at copper distribution in the wood and across the cell wall 
(Matsunaga et al. 2007, Archer, unpublished) while another report circulated 
around that time looked at macro-distribution (Detter-Hoskin)  One study did 
not find any copper in the cell wall while the other found low levels of copper 
which the authors ascribed to the presence of small amounts of soluble 
copper.  The macrodistribution study found variable distribution within the 
wood structure. 
 
Little field performance data has been made available, although in 
presentations it has been stated that one MCQ preservative performed as well 
as the amine copper systems at the Austin Carey test site in Gainesville, FL, 
in a ground contact stake tests. 
 
In our earlier work we expressed concern as to whether the absence of cell 
wall penetration of the copper preservative component would lead to failure 
from soft rot in service (Hulme, 1977).  In discussion of this work, this concern 
was verbally refuted although data was not available at that time.  At that time 
we did not consider basidiomycetes fungi to be an issue as available soil 
block data was said to support efficacy claims in this regard.  At that time the 
assumption was made that the apparent presence of insoluble copper 
particles on the lumen surfaces would perhaps inhibit such fungal attack. 
 4
 
Within Viance questions arose as to whether our technical concerns in 
regards to the likely long term performance were valid, especially when some 
large wood treaters, and one or two large retailers were promoting such 
products.  In order to address such concerns, and lacking available literature 
on the performance of particulate copper systems in comparison with 
solubilized copper systems such as ACQ and CuAz, we embarked on a study 
using commercially available materials from reputable wood treating 
companies, with treatment chemicals supplied to those treaters by 
organizations other than Viance. The research project was designed to 
provide, as closely as possible, treated materials that were representative of 
the products being marketed. 
 
Methods 
 
Test Materials 
 
Southern yellow pine 4 x 4 x 8 foot long posts treated to retentions of 0.40 pcf 
(6.4 kg/m3) with either alkaline copper quat (ACQ-D) or Micronized Copper 
Quat (MCQ) were procured from local retailers in the Charlotte, NC area. A 
total of seven posts were obtained for each treatment. The ACQ material was 
purchased from one retailer and the MCQ material was purchased from 
another retailer.  All material and identifying tags were photographed and 
recorded. 
 
Test Sample preparation for ground contact field tests 
 
Before cutting the materials into test samples, each post was cross-cut into 
four foot (1200mm) lengths and then thin cross-section wafers were cut from 
the center zone of each post. One set of these wafers was sprayed with a 
heartwood indicator and also a copper penetration indicator in order to 
visualize the preservative penetration patterns, which were quite uniform 
throughout the sapwood zones of the posts.  Photographic records were 
made of this work.  The treated portion - excluding the untreated heartwood 
areas - of another set of these wafers representing all of the posts was 
analyzed for the preservative components (CuO and DDACarbonate). The 
results of these analyses are shown in Table 1. In addition to the composite 
analysis of the cross section from each post, a corner section cross sectional 
wafer from each of the posts measuring 30mm square was divided into 15 
mm quadrants for chemical analysis. Each of these quadrants, labeled A, B, 
C, D, was representative of the individual stakes cut from each post (Fig. 1). A 
composite sample was made from each of these quadrants and analyzed for 
CuO. The results of these analyses are shown in Table 1.   
 
For the analyses, the cross sections of the posts were cut so that no 
heartwood was present for the analysis.  Two cross section pieces were cut 
and ground together to form one homogeneous sample for each post.  The 
wood was ground through a 30-mesh screen, then dried and evaluated for 
copper on the ASOMA X-ray fluorescence analyzer and quat by a Mettler-
Toledo auto-titration system. 
 5
 
The groups of ACQ and MCQ materials were machined to provide groups of 
stakes representing the commercial ground contact retention treatment 
derived from each mother post.  The stakes were cut from the outside corner 
zones of the posts.  Heartwood zones were avoided while knots were avoided 
as far as practical.  The mother board information was recorded and 
distribution of the stakes from each mother board was evenly distributed 
among the various test sites and test types.  Metal barcode information for 
each site/test was recorded and correlated with the original mother board 
analytical information. In addition, 120 30 x 30 x 450mm) stakes were cut from 
untreated southern yellow pine boards to serve as controls. 
 
Field Stake Tests 
 
The ground contact field decay tests reported in this paper installed during the 
first half of 2007 are shown below: 
 
Tanegashima 
 
Ground contact stake test: 20 stakes each of ACQ-D and MCQ, and 20 
untreated control stakes. 
 
Hilo (Keaau decay site 1) 
 
Ground contact stake test: 10 stakes each of ACQ-D and MCQ, and 10 
untreated control stakes. 
 
 
Installation of Stake Tests 
 
The stakes were installed randomly in rows to a depth of no more than half 
their length at test sites near Hilo, HI and in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan.  
The Hilo test site is an open field with a rich loam soil type, while the 
Tanegashima site is an open canopy site on a light loam soil.  Average rainfall 
in Hilo is approximately 3250mm while the Kagoshima prefecture site has an 
average rainfall of approximately 2100mm. 
 
Results 
 
Chemical Analyses  
 
As mentioned above extensive chemical analyses were carried out at various 
stages of the work.  The results of work carried out during the preparation of 
the materials is summarized in Table 1 below.  This data shows that both 
preservative systems show similar variations in preservative retention from 
post to post and within the posts as shown in the quadrant analyses.  There 
are no obvious differences or deficiencies seen in either preservative 
treatment for either copper or quat retention and distribution in the materials 
used.  The MCQ posts tended to be more tightly targeted around the required 
retention for the commercial treatment, and but the distribution of both 
 6
preservative system and their components was within the accepted range and 
in these materials.  No remarkable trends were discernible between or within 
the systems and materials used that would indicate the results obtained in the 
field exposures.  The analytical data for the posts indicates that the ACQ 
treated posts were treated in accordance with AWPA standards (there is 
presently no AWPA standard for MCQ) and that the MCQ were treated 
equivalently to that expected for these active ingredients in the AWPA 
standards.  There is some variation in preservative retentions of the different 
posts, but this is normal for commercial treatments.

Biscuits of the cross-section of each individual stake exposed in Tanegashima were 
cut 10mm from the top of each stake.  Copper analysis was performed on all the cross 
sections in order to gain the better idea of the treatment levels in the testing stakes.   
Again the heartwood and copper indicators were sprayed on the cross sections of 
each stake and they showed no heartwood presented in the stakes and all the stakes 
appeared fully penetrated with copper for both treatment types.  The copper analysis 
results are shown in Table 2 below and the results show that the individual stakes 
have similar or higher retentions of preservatives than the whole post cross section 
analysis data and are well within the targeted retention levels.

During the recent field test inspection in Japan carried out early in 2008, one of the 
stakes was removed from the test due to failure from decay.  This stake was 
recovered for further chemical analyses.  The stake was subsequently sawn above 
the exposed groundline and the cut cross-section was sprayed with heartwood 
indicator and also copper penetration indicator.  These visualizations showed that the 
stake was a sapwood stake with no heartwood and had been fully penetrated by the 
preservative during the treatment process. 
 
Since the decay occurred in almost the entire cross section except for 3-5mm on two 
sides, chemical analysis was carried out for two samples: one from the one (5mm) of 
the two apparently undecayed sides and the other for all the area where decay 
occurred.  The samples were obtained from the portion of stakes right above the 
ground line. The results of the analysis of the cross section of the original 4x4 post 
 9
which the stake was cut from and the two sections from the decayed stake were found 
to be 5.0 kg/m3 and 8.28 kg/m3.  The weighted average retention for this stake is 6.14 
kg/m3, close to that of the targeted retention of 6.4 kg/m3.   The requisite retention of 
quat (DDACarbonate) was present in the treated area.   
 
These retentions may also be compared with the recent introduction into the U.S. 
marketplace of the revised ground contact retention for MCQ in southern pine of 
0.34pcf (5.44 kg/m3), as CuO plus DDAC (2:1).  It should be noted that other 
particulate copper systems have been introduced recently for the treatment of 
southern yellow pine with ground contact retentions of 0.14pcf (2.2 kg/m3 Cu and 
0.086 kg/m3 triazole) and 0.17pcf (2.72 kg/m3) (2.62 kg/m3 Cu and 0.104 kg/m3 
triazole).  While this study does not address any potential differences in ground 
contact performance that different secondary biocides may impart, the use of lowered 
copper retentions with particulate copper preservatives may merit further extensive 
ground contact testing. 
 
 
Field Stake Inspections 
 
The results from the inspection of the field stakes installed in Japan are presented in 
Table 3.  From this data it is apparent that this is an aggressive test site, with many of 
the untreated controls and MCQ treated wood stakes showing considerable decay 
after nine months’ exposure. It is also apparent from this data that the ACQ treated 
stakes are performing very well, with none of the stakes showing evidence of decay.

It is apparent from the results obtained at these two test sites that MCQ is showing 
premature decay, even though the analytical data indicates that the test material was 
treated in accordance the 0.40pcf ground contact retention specified for ACQ-D within 
the AWPA standards.  (Note that the MCQ posts were treated to the 0.40pcf retention 
approved at that time for MCQ in ground contact by the ICC-ES, and qualified by third 
party inspection [as is the norm in the U.S.]) 
 
 
Discussion 
 
The extensive analytical work carried out as part of this study was to determine if 
significant chemical retention or distribution differences existed between either the two 
commercial treatments with the two different preservatives with the same targeted 
active ingredient retentions, or within the chemical retention and distributions within 
the stake sets.  While there are differences, as is always the case, within the 
commercially treated wood and within the stake sets, the differences are overlapping 
and do not appear to be at all causal to the performance differences seen to date in 
the field stake tests in ground contact. 
 
Rather, it seems more likely that the differences between the performance of ACQ- 
and MCQ-treated wood observed in this study seem likely to be due to efficacy 
differences between solubilized copper and particulate copper preservative systems.  
In this section we have attempted to provide reasoned explanations to address the 
observed results.  One or more of the following factors, along with other possibilities, 
may be causal agents: 
 
 12
• The differences in surface-to-volume ratio between particulate copper 
compared to solubilized copper and how this impacts the oxalic acid inhibition 
process of copper-tolerant fungi. 
• Microdistribution/retention levels of copper within the cell wall. 
• Differences in the bioactivity of solubilized versus particulate copper, and 
possible synergistic effects of the copper and the secondary organic biocide, in 
protecting the wood from multiple fungal vectors. 
• The moisture content of the wood in ground contact and how this impacts the 
solubility of copper ions from particulate copper and, consequently, any 
protective effect of such copper against decay fungi. 
• Field test site variations with respect to soil chemistry and moisture, wood 
moisture, fungal species present, etc. 
 
 
Little, if any, scientific information has been published on the mechanism of action of 
particulate copper fungicides as wood preservatives.  Perhaps the most likely 
surrogate for this lies with the foliar copper fungicides, which are largely insoluble 
copper compounds sprayed on leaves or other exposed plant surfaces to protect 
plants from fungal attack.  The mechanism of foliar copper fungicides is generally 
considered to be rainfall on the plants solubilizing small amounts of the copper which 
prevent spores from developing (Richardson, 1997a).  Extrapolating this concept to 
wood preservatives is difficult for a couple of reasons, with the most notable being that 
within the wood structure actively growing fungal mycelia are present rather than 
spores trying to develop and survive within a limited time.  Further, in some situations 
insufficient moisture may be present in the wood to give sufficient mobile copper to 
combat any fungal mycelia which are actively growing in the wood.  While it is 
possible with particulate copper, as described previously (Matsunaga,  et al. 2007), for 
some copper ions to be solubilized and subsequently possibly penetrate the cell wall, 
the amount/retention level of the solubilized copper within the cell wall may, as Evans 
clearly noted, be insufficient to protect against soft rot attack.  Furthermore, the 
retention level within the cell wall may even be inadequate to protect against actively 
growing basidiomycetes fungi.   
 
The mechanism of action of wood destroying copper tolerant fungi has been studied 
extensively.  Some studies show that such fungi gain their copper tolerance by 
converting active soluble copper ions into insoluble copper oxalate (Clausen et al. 
2000). Other studies have shown the formation of calcium oxalate and also 
differences between mechanisms observed inside and outside of the wood matrix 
(Schilling and Jellison).  It is instructive to compare the water solubility of copper 
oxalate and copper carbonate.  Copper(II) oxalate is stated to be “Practically insoluble 
in water”, while copper(II) carbonate is “virtually insoluble in water” but “sol in dil acids” 
such as the acidic environment that can surround fungal decay mycelia (Budavari et 
al., The Merck Index, 11th ed, Merck and Co., 1989; Goodell 2003, Richardson 
1997b).  In considering the differences between copper oxalate and copper carbonate 
in regards to solubility and bioavailability, with wood treated with solubilized copper 
each copper cation is likely a separate entity. Consequently, the copper-tolerant fungi 
would need to spend considerable metabolic energy biosynthesizing sufficient oxalic 
acid to complex the relatively high levels of bioavailable copper.  By contrast, with 
particulate copper only the copper carbonate on the surface of each particulate cluster 
is available to be solubilized; any copper in the interior of the particle would be 
 13
insoluble and therefore not bioactive until the surface erodes away.  Furthermore, 
decay fungi may only need to produce sufficient oxalic acid to cover the surface of the 
particulate copper to prevent any of the copper in that particle from solubilizing.  
Assuming that each copper particle is a sphere, the number of copper atoms in that 
sphere is a cube function while the surface area is only a square function.  Thus, the 
copper-tolerant fungus may only have to biosynthesize a relatively limited level of 
oxalic acid with wood treated with particulate copper, with energy resources thus freed 
up for the copper colorant fungi to expend on decay activities. 
 
Another factor at work could be possible synergistic protective effects by the soluble 
copper and organic co-biocide.  We have long recognized that a wide variety of 
microorganisms are involved in the fungal decay of wood, but recent technical 
advances have made us even more aware of this.  Specifically, with modern DNA 
techniques it was recently noted that only 2% of the decay fungi that exist on wood 
can be isolated and grown on agar media (Kirker, 2008); the vast majority of decay 
fungi present were not recognized by traditional techniques.  Further, wood-inhabiting 
but non-decay fungal and bacterial microorganisms also play a role in the decay 
process, and most are likely inhibited by copper ions.  While we surmise that the 
activity or inactivity of the copper compounds in a mixed preservative system 
consisting of copper and other biocide component(s) may well influence the ability of 
secondary biocides to protect wood in ground contact from the multiple decay fungi 
and other involved but non-decay vectors, little data is available to directly address 
this issue.  It would not be unreasonable to assume, however, that the combination of 
two biocides – both of which need to be present at some minimal level – would be 
more effective than the co-organic biocide and only a limited level of actively available 
copper.   
 
It is generally considered that the optimum conditions for decay by basidiomycete 
fungi in wood products occurs when the temperature is between 10oC and 30oC and 
the moisture content of the wood is at or above 25% MC (but less than around 100% 
MC).  When one considers this in the light of the mechanism of foliar copper 
fungicides described above, it can be postulated that it might be possible for decay to 
develop in wood that has sufficient moisture for fungal decay but insufficient free water 
to solubilize copper from the insoluble particulate copper. 
 
A further factor of a more general nature involves the differences between ground 
contact performance of treated wood at different test sites.  Temperature is clearly a 
predictable factor in decay rates, and soil moisture plays a role also, but the most 
significant factor is soil type and its relationship to soil moisture and how this affects 
the overall decay fungal pressure on any given wood product system, biocide-treated 
or otherwise.  The two test sites used in this study were significantly different in soil 
type and moisture.  The Hilo test site is a rich loamy soil with high rainfall and a dense 
grass cover that retains high moisture even being fully exposed to the sun.  The 
Tanegashima test site has a lighter loam soil with a light forest litter cover on a well 
drained slope, under a light forest canopy.  While stake moisture contents were not 
taken at either site, the general moisture content of the Hilo stakes is highly likely to 
often be greater than for stakes exposed at the Tanegashima test site.  How this has 
affected the results to date has not been determined.  Further, it is likely that copper-
tolerant and/or soft-rot fungi are more prevalent in certain soil types than others.

It is clear from the above that one or more of a variety of explanations could explain 
our results.  Indeed there may be further factors that we have not addressed which 
could be contributing to the striking differences in performance observed.  We are 
continuing our studies using a variety of methodologies and test sites in the hope that 
such research will bring further clarity to our recent observations. 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
The results indicated significant differences in the performance of the two commercial 
copper preservative systems included in these stake tests after a very short time 
period.  The presence of wood decay in the particulate copper treated samples after 
this short exposure period suggests that the use of particulate copper rather than 
soluble amine-complexed copper in the formulation has lead to substantially faster 
onset of decay than is the norm with the soluble copper formulation.  Additional field 
stake tests are being carried out to further investigate the phenomenon and to further 
quantify the differences in performance seen to date.  There is also considerable 
scope for detailed scientific investigation into the mode of action, of such particulate 
copper preservative systems.
