ABSTRACT
Plasmids harbored by Staphylococcus aureus are
a major contributor to the spread of bacterial
multi-drug resistance. Plasmid conjugation and
partition are critical to the dissemination and inher-
itance of such plasmids. Here, we demonstrate that
the ArtA protein encoded by the S. aureus multi-
resistance plasmid pSK41 is a global transcriptional
regulator of pSK41 genes, including those involved
in conjugation and segregation. ArtA shows no
sequence homology to any structurally charac-
terized DNA-binding protein. To elucidate the mech-
anism by which it specifically recognizes its DNA
site, we obtained the structure of ArtA bound to its
cognate operator, ACATGACATG. The structure
reveals that ArtA is representative of a new family
of ribbon–helix–helix (RHH) DNA-binding proteins
that contain extended, N-terminal basic motifs.
Strikingly, unlike most well-studied RHH proteins
ArtA binds its cognate operators as a dimer.
However, we demonstrate that it is also able to
recognize an atypical operator site by binding as
a dimer-of-dimers and the extended N-terminal
regions of ArtA were shown to be essential for this
dimer-of-dimer binding mode. Thus, these data
indicate that ArtA is a master regulator of genes
critical for both horizontal and vertical transmission
of pSK41 and that it can recognize DNA utilizing
alternate binding modes.
INTRODUCTION
The emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria has now
become a global threat to human health. Indeed, more
people in the United States now die from multi-drug resis-
tant forms of Staphylococcus aureus than AIDS (1–4).
Multi-drug resistance determinants in S. aureus are
found chromosomally and on plasmids (5). The largest
staphylococcal plasmids are the conjugative multi-
resistance plasmids, which are typiﬁed by the prototype
pSK41 (6). Members of the pSK41 family of plasmids
encode a wide array of resistance phenotypes; for
example, pLW1043 confers resistance to ﬁve diﬀerent
classes of anti-microbial agents. The conjugation system
of these plasmids makes them eﬃcient vehicles of horizon-
tal transfer, and they therefore represent important
mediators of multi-drug resistance transmission between
bacterial strains, and hence a signiﬁcant medical threat.
pSK41-like plasmids show a high degree of structural
and sequence similarity such that a conserved plasmid
backbone can be recognized, into which distinct DNA
segments encoding various resistance genes have been
integrated, often mediated by the activities of the insertion
element IS257 that consequently ﬂanks many of these
segments (5). In pSK41, resistance segments divide the
backbone into two segments; viz., the transfer (tra)
region that contains genes associated with conjugative
transfer, and Region 1 that contains genes involved
plasmid replication and maintenance, encoding the repli-
cation initiation protein, a resolvase and partitioning
proteins, as well as the conjugative nickase (6,8–10).
The artA gene is encoded at one end of the tra region,
divergently transcribed from the other tra genes. The 7

kDa product of the identical homolog from the pSK41-
like plasmid pGO1, TrsN, has been shown to bind to the
three tra region promoters, PtrsN, PtrsA and PtrsL, and to
repress transcription of the latter (11). The equivalent
promoters in pSK41 each contain the sequence CATGA
CA overlapping their 35 sequences (12), and three
promoters with this feature were subsequently identiﬁed
within Region 1 (6), including the promoter responsible
for transcription of the plasmid’s parMR type II partition-
ing system (10). These observations suggested that ArtA
might act as a key regulator that coordinates transcription
of most pSK41 backbone genes.
The regulation of genes required for conjugative
transfer and partition/segregation is critical to plasmid
maintenance (13). ArtA shows no sequence homology to
any structurally characterized DNA-binding protein and
thus how it binds DNA and regulates transcription is
unknown. We have therefore carried out cellular, bio-
chemical and X-ray crystallographic studies to determine
the role of ArtA in transcriptional regulation of pSK41
genes in vivo and to elucidate its structural mechanism of
DNA binding. These data indicate that ArtA is a global
regulator of genes critical for pSK41 transmission and
that the ArtA protein utilizes diﬀerent modes for
binding consensus versus atypical DNA operator sites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, growth conditions and plasmids
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed
in Table 1. Bacterial strains were grown at 37C in LB or
on plates containing LB medium and 1.5% w/v Oxoid
agar, unless otherwise stated. S. aureus electrocompetent
cells were prepared using B2 medium as described earlier
(14). When required, media was supplemented with
ampicillin (Ap) 100 mg/ml, cadmium chloride (CdCl2) 0.1
or 5 mM, neomycin (Nm) 15 mg/ml, tetracycline (Tc) 10 mg/
ml and trimethoprim (Tm) 250 mg/ml.
DNA manipulations
Plasmid DNA was isolated from Escherichia coli using the
alkaline lysis method (15) or the Quantum Prep plasmid
miniprep kit (Bio-Rad). Cloning in E. coli was performed
using standard methods and restriction enzymes, calf
alkaline phosphatase and T4 DNA ligase were purchased
from New England Biolabs. DNA fragments were PCR-
ampliﬁed using ‘Taq’ (New England Biolabs) or ‘Pfu’
Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Automated DNA
sequencing was performed by the Australian Genome
Research Facility (University of Queensland, Australia).
CAT Assays
Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays based
on the method of Shaw (16) were adapted to microplate
format as described earlier (8). Lysostaphin, acetyl
Coenzyme A and 5-50-dithio-bis[2-nitrobenzoic acid]
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and bovine serum
albumin from New England Biolabs. CAT units are
expressed as nanomoles of chloramphenicol acetylated
per milligram of protein per minute at 37C and are the
average of at least three independent assays.
Primer extension
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Gibco-
BRL) from exponential-phase cultures of S. aureus
RN4220 containing the appropriate plasmid. Glass
beads (100 mm; Sigma) in combination with a bead
beater (Bio 101) were used for cell lysis. Primer extension
was performed as previously described (8) using M-MuLV
reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) and
sequencing ladders were prepared with the SequiTherm
EXCEL II DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies).
Protein overexpression and puriﬁcation
The pSK41 artA coding region was PCR-ampliﬁed and
digested with EcoRI and PstI, and cloned into the respec-
tive sites of the expression vector pTTQ18RGSH6. An
RGSH6 tag was fused to the C-terminal end to facilitate
puriﬁcation of ArtA. The fusion construct, pSK6825,
was checked by DNA sequencing and used to transform
E. coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant ArtA protein was
puriﬁed using Ni-NTA chromatography. Pure ArtA was
eluted with native elution buﬀer (50mM Tris–HCl pH 7.0,
300mM NaCl, 300mM imidazole) and aliquots of each
puriﬁcation step were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ArtA was
then re-buﬀered into DNA-binding buﬀer (10mM Tris–
HCl pH 7.5, 10mM MgCl2, 100mM NaCl, 0.2mM DTT,
10% glycerol), using a Sephadex PD10 column (GE
Healthcare).
DNA-binding experiments
The pSK41 backbone promoter regions were PCR-
ampliﬁed and end-labeled using [g32P]ATP (GE
Healthcare) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England
Biolabs). The end-labeled promoter fragments were
puriﬁed using the illustraTM DNA and Gel Puriﬁcation
Kit (GE Healthcare), eluted in water and stored at
20C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)
were performed by incubating the endlabeled fragments
(6000 c.p.m.) with 2 mg of poly[dI-dC] (Sigma Aldrich) and
increasing amounts of puriﬁed ArtA in DNA-binding
buﬀer (10mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 10mM MgCl2, 100mM
NaCl, 0.2mM DTT, 10% glycerol). Binding reactions
(20ml total volume) were incubated for 30min at room
temperature and analyzed using 4% polyacrylamide gels
and 0.5 X TBE buﬀering.
DNase I footprinting was performed using end-labeled
promoter fragments (one primer end-labeled prior to
PCR-ampliﬁcation), which were incubated with increasing
amounts of puriﬁed ArtA using the EMSA conditions
described above. The volume of each reaction was
brought to 200 ml with DNase I buﬀer (10mM Tris–HCl
pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM CaCl2, 100mM KCl, 2mM
DTT, 50 mg/ml BSA, 2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). DNase
I, at a concentration pre-determined to nick 50% of the
DNA once, was added in 20 ml of DNase I buﬀer and
digestion was allowed to proceed for 2min at room tem-
perature before the addition of 700 mL of DNase I stop
solution (92% ethanol, 3M sodium acetate, 10 mg/ml

salmon sperm DNA). DNA samples were ethanol
precipitated and analyzed using denaturing 8%
polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Sequencing ladders were
prepared using the SequiTherm EXCEL II DNA
sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies).
Protein expression and puriﬁcation for crystallization
For crystallization, ArtA was produced using a diﬀerent
expression construct, as well diﬀracting crystals could not
be obtained with a His-tagged ArtA protein. To produce
this construct, the artA gene was cloned into pET-15b
(Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites,
producing a protein containing a cleavable N-terminal
His-tag. The protein was puriﬁed using Ni2+-NTA chro-
matography and then dialyzed into digestion buﬀer
(20mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 500mM NaCl) for 5–6 h.
Thrombin cleavage (GE Healthcare Biosciences) was
then carried out overnight at room temperature to
remove the N-terminal His-tag. Finally, gel ﬁltration
was applied to remove residual thrombin. ArtA was
buﬀer exchanged and concentrated to 30mg/ml in
20mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 50mM NaCl.
Crystallization
For crystallization, a 12 bp dsDNA (50-GACATGACA
TGT-30 and 50-CACATGTCATGT-30, Oligos Etc.) was
annealed by heating the DNA to 95C for 5min,
followed by slow cooling at room temperature. The best
crystals were obtained using a complex composed of a
molar ratio of one ArtA dimer to one DNA duplex.
Crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diﬀusion
using 5% (w/v) PEG 2000, 100mM Acetate pH 4.60 as
a crystallization solution.
Data collection, structure determination and reﬁnement
Because ArtA contains only one methionine at its
N-terminus, the structure was solved by bromo-MAD
phasing using crystals containing bromouracil substitu-
tions for thymines in the DNA operator site (50-GACA
XGACAXGT-30 and 50-CACAXGTCAXGT-30, where X
represents 5-bromo-deoxyuridine). The crystals contained
an ArtA dimer and DNA duplex in the crystallographic
asymmetric unit (ASU) and all four bromine sites were
located with SOLVE (17), resulting in a ﬁgure of merit
of 0.58 to 2.80 A˚ resolution. Model building was carried
out using the graphics programs O and Coot (18,19).
After multiple rounds of reﬁnement in CNS (20) and
re-building, using the high-resolution native data, the
Rfactor/Rfree converged to 23.9/26.4% at 2.35 A˚ resolution.
The reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The
coordinates and structure factors have been deposited
with RCSB Protein Data Bank.
Fluorescence polarization assays
Fluorescence polarization (FP) assays of ArtA–DNA
binding were performed using a Pavera Beacon Fluores-
cence Polarization system (21). All oligonucleotides used
in the assays were 50-ﬂuorescein labeled. For each assay,
increasing concentrations of ArtA were titrated into the
binding mixture containing 2 nM DNA in 20mM Tris–
HCl pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl. The excitation and emission
wavelengths were 490 and 530 nm, respectively. All data
were processed in Kaleidagraph and ﬁt with the equation
P={(Pbound –Pfree)[Protein]/(Kd + [Protein])} +Pfree,
where P is the polarization magnitude at a given protein
concentration, Pfree is the initial polarization of the free
oligonucleotide and Pbound is the maximum polarization
when the oligonucleotide is saturated by ArtA. Non-linear
least squares analysis was applied to determine Pbound,
and Kd. In all assays, poly[dI-dC] (5 mg/ml, Sigma
Aldrich) was used as a non-speciﬁc binding competitor.
FP stoichiometry experiments were carried out by titrating
ArtA into a solution with 20mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5,
50mM NaCl, 2 nM ﬂuoresceinated oligonucleotide and
25-fold excess non-ﬂuoresceinated oligonucleotide. In
all titrations, 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) was added as a non-
speciﬁc DNA competitor. All titration curves were ﬁtted
by Kaleidagraph.
RESULTS
The ArtA regulon
To establish which pSK41 backbone promoters (Figure 1)
are regulated by ArtA, the three pSK41 tra promoters and
ten Region 1 promoters were ampliﬁed from pSK41 by
PCR and cloned upstream of the promoterless cat
reporter gene of the promoter-probe vector pSK5483 (8),
which facilitates measurement of CAT activity as an indi-
cator of promoter strength in S. aureus. CAT assays were
performed on whole-cell lysates prepared from S. aureus
RN4220 cells harboring individual reporter constructs
co-resident with the ArtA expression plasmid pSK7701
or the corresponding control vector pSK7700. Thus in
this assay, ArtA responsiveness was indicated by sig-
niﬁcantly reduced CAT activity from a given pSK41
promoter when co-resident with pSK7701, in comparison
to that obtained in the presence of pSK7700.
As shown in Figure 2, six of the promoters tested, PartA,
PtraA, PtraL, Porf538, Porf259 and Ppar, were signiﬁcantly
repressed in cells expressing the ArtA protein. The
promoters of the two tra region operons, PtraA and PtraL,
were each repressed by >90%, as were Porf538 and Ppar
from Region 1. PartA was auto-regulated (82% repression)
and Porf259 was the least sensitive ArtA-regulated
promoter (51% repression). Six other Region 1 promoters
were not regulated by ArtA, including those for the repli-
cation initiation gene, rep, the resolvase, res and the con-
jugative nickase, nes. Additionally, since ArtA had no
aﬀect on transcription from Prep, it is likewise expected
to have no inﬂuence on the promoter for the rep anti-
sense regulator RNAI (8), which was present in the
Prep-cat reporter plasmid and hence should have revealed
any such regulation; this could not be tested directly
because PrnaI-cat constructs appear to be non-viable.
Primer extension mapping conﬁrmed the existence of
transcript start points (TSPs) for each of the ArtA-
regulated promoters; TSPs for Prep, and Pres have been
reported previously (8,9). The present studies employed
RNA isolated from S. aureus cells harboring pSK41,
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 20 6973
and additionally for promoters within Region 1, from cells
containing the pSK41 derivative pSK5093 that lacks the
tra region, and hence artA, due to a deletion resulting
from homologous recombination between ﬂanking IS257
elements (6). pSK41-derived RNA facilitated the detection
of appropriately located TSPs for Porf259, Porf538 and PtraA
(Supplementary Figure S1; Figure 3). Consistent with
artA derepression, pSK5093-derived RNA additionally
enabled detection of Ppar, and yielded more intense
signals for both Porf259 and Por538. TSPs for PartA and
PtraL were similarly detected in the absence of artA by
using RNA isolated from cells harboring the relevant
Ptra-cat fusion constructs employed above (pSK7759 and
pSK7761, respectively).
Delineation of ArtA operators
In EMSAs, puriﬁed ArtA protein was shown to bind spe-
ciﬁcally to DNA fragments containing each of the
promoters found to be repressed by ArtA in CAT
assays, but not those containing the ArtA-insensitive
promoters (data not shown). DNase I footprinting was
undertaken to localize ArtA binding at each promoter.
These studies revealed that the region protected by ArtA

indicating the direction of transcription. ArtA-regulated genes are colored grey. Resistance genes shown are aacA–aphD and aadD (aminoglycoside

encompassed CATGACA sequences that overlay the 35
sequence of each regulated promoter (Supplementary
Figure S2; Figure 3).
Overall structure of ArtA–DNA complex
ArtA shows no sequence homology to any structurally
characterized DNA-binding protein. Thus to elucidate
the mechanism by which ArtA binds its cognate DNA
site, we next crystallized and determined the structure of
ArtA bound to a 12-mer DNA duplex containing
the ArtA consensus site (top strand; 50-GACATGACAT
GT-30, consensus shown in bold) (Figure 4A). The struc-
ture was solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dif-
fraction (MAD) using DNA in which thymines were
substituted with 5-Bromo-uracil (see ‘Materials and
Methods’ section). There are two ArtA molecules and
one 12-mer DNA duplex in the ASU. The structure
includes 11 bp of the DNA duplex and residues 7–59 of
each subunit and has been reﬁned to an Rwork/Rfree of
23.9/26.4% to 2.35 A˚ resolution (Table 2).
The structure reveals that ArtA belongs to the ribbon–
helix–helix (RHH) family of DNA-binding proteins and
displays the topology b1–a1–a2 (b1; residues 17–23, a1;
residues 26–38, a2; residues 43–59) (Figure 4B). Structural
homology searches revealed that the ArtA RHH unit
shows the strongest structural similarity with the
transcriptional repressor CopG protein; the ArtA and
CopG structures superimpose with a root mean squared
deviation (RMSD) of 1.57 A˚ for 44 corresponding Ca
atoms (22). Two ArtA subunits tightly associate in the
structure to form the functional RHH2 unit. The
hydrophobic core of ArtA is extensive and is formed by
residues V17, L19 and L21 from the b strand, residues
M26, I31, I32, Y34 from a1 and residues L43, I50, L51,
L55, I58 from a2.
While the RHH units of each ArtA monomer adopt
essentially identical conformations, as underscored by
the RMSD of 0.31 A˚ for superimposition of Ca atoms
of residues 17–59, the N-terminal residues 7–16 adopt
distinct conformations in each subunit and extend
outward towards the DNA (Figure 4C). Indeed, residues
from this N-terminal arm provide some interactions
with the DNA phosphate backbone (shown below).
However, all DNA–nucleobase interactions are provided
by residues located on the anti-parallel b strands. Notably,
speciﬁcation of the ArtA DNA consensus sequence is
mediated by one ArtA dimer (Figure 5A–D). This
reveals a signiﬁcant distinction between ArtA and most
other structurally characterized RHH proteins, which
bind DNA as dimer-of-dimers (23).
Operator recognition
In most RHH proteins, three residues in the ribbon
(b-strand) mediate speciﬁc interactions with bases in the
DNA major groove (8,23–32). In ArtA, the corresponding
residues, S18, H20 and L22, participate in either base
speciﬁc or phosphate contacts. The L22 side chain
makes hydrophobic contacts with DNA ribose groups.
In addition, the carbonyl group of L22 forms hydrogen
bonds with the Ne of R480 (where ‘ 0 ’ indicates other
subunit of the dimer), which positions the R48 side
chain optimally for interaction with the phosphate
backbone. Finally, the amide nitrogen of L22 interacts
with same phosphate group indirectly via a water
mediated contact. Interestingly, the majority of base
contacts are made by one ArtA residue, H20, from each
subunit. The environment of the DNA likely inﬂuences
the side chain H20 pKa as we ﬁnd that ArtA is able to
bind its consensus site with equal aﬃnities at pH values
ranging from 4.6 to 8.5 (Supplementary Figure S3).
The H20 side chain participates in hydrogen bonds,
hydrophobic and stacking interactions. Speciﬁcally, Nd
of H20 interacts with the N7 of guanine 6 (Figure 5A).
The H20 imidazole ring also stacks with thymine 7, where
the distance between methyl group of thymine and
imidazole ring of H20 is 4 A˚ (Figure 5B). The Ne of
H20 hydrogen bonds with Og of S180 from its dimer
mate and this interaction positions the S18 side chain
Cb from one subunit to make hydrophobic contacts
with the methyl group of the central thymine base.
Notably, this contact from S18 is the only base interaction
not provided by H20 (Figure 5D).

Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 20 6975
An important structural characteristic of RHH family
proteins is a conserved loop motif G-X-S/T/N between a2
and a2, which makes contacts with the DNA phosphate
backbone and helps dock the RHH onto the DNA (Figure
5C). These interactions involve direct contacts from
amide nitrogens and side chains near the N-terminus
of a2 as well as a positive contribution from the helical
dipole of a2, which points directly towards the phos-
phate backbone. In ArtA, the G-X-S/T/N motif is
slightly elongated and has a diﬀerent residue content
than other structurally characterized RHH. Nonetheless,
it retains a structure similar to other RHH proteins and
the N-terminus of its a2 makes numerous interactions
with the DNA phosphate backbone. The Nd of N42 in
the loop interacts with O2P of Adenine 4 and two
nitrogens of main-chain amides of V43 and S44 contact
phosphate backbone atoms O2P and O1P of thymine
5 (Figure 5C). Finally, R48 forms salt bridges with the
O1P moiety of Adenine 4.
ArtA-bound DNA conformation
The ArtA-bound DNA is primarily B form in conforma-
tion. For example, the average twist of the ArtA-
complexed DNA is 33.4 A˚ compared with 34.3 A˚ for
B-DNA. The central consensus site speciﬁed by ArtA is
not signiﬁcantly bent (33). However, conformational
alterations caused by ArtA binding include major
groove widening near the bound H20 residues, whereby
the DNA major groove width is 15.0 A˚ compared with
11.7 A˚ in B-DNA. The minor groove is correspondingly
compressed to a width of 4.2 A˚, compared with 5.7 A˚ in
B-DNA. This DNA distortion in groove width may play
some role in transcriptional regulation by aﬀecting
binding of the s factor (see below).
FP analysis of ArtA-operator binding
As noted, ArtA is somewhat unique among RHH proteins
in that it binds the cognate TGACA site located in the
promoters it regulates as a dimer. However, in addition to
its RHH motif, ArtA contains a 16 residue N-terminal
Figure 4. (A) DNA sequence used in crystallization of the ArtA–DNA complex. The ArtA consensus site is colored red and the positions of the

arm, parts of which cannot be identiﬁed in electron density
maps. Interestingly, this extended region (MNNNEENSV
FFGKKKK) lies close to the phosphate backbone in the
structure and contains four consecutive lysine residues,
K13 through K16, indicating that it may play a role in
DNA binding. Indeed, the amide nitrogens of the 2-fold
related K16 residues make contacts to the phosphate
backbone while the lysine side chains make electrostatic
interactions with the DNA. The remaining lysine residues
appear too far from the DNA to contribute directly to
nucleotide binding. However, the DNA we used for crys-
tallization was a 12-mer oligonucleotide containing the
minimal ArtA consensus binding site and thus, conceiv-
ably, might not be long enough to provide phosphates for
interaction with lysine residues in the extended arm. This
prompted us to ask whether this region might play a
role in binding longer DNA sites. To address this possi-
bility, a truncation mutant, 14ArtA, was made in which
the ﬁrst 14 amino acids were removed. FP studies
were then carried out to analyze the DNA-binding
activities of the wild-type ArtA and the truncation
mutant 14ArtA. Three oligonucleotides of diﬀerent
length (11-, 16- and 22-mer) were designed based on
the consensus binding site in the ArtA-regulated
promoters to assay DNA binding to the minimal versus
longer DNA sites. The results are summarized in Table 3.
These studies revealed no diﬀerences in the binding
aﬃnities of the 16- and 22-mer DNA sites for ArtA and
14ArtA and a very minor, or 2-fold decrease, in wild-
type ArtA and 14 ArtA binding to the 11-mer compared
with the 16- and 22-mer. The slight reduction in DNA
binding of ArtA to the 11-mer compared with the
longer sites may indicate that residues other than
those in the N-terminal arms are providing minor
contributions to DNA binding to longer sites, likely to
the phosphate backbone. However, 2-fold diﬀerences
in binding are on the order of one to a few weak inter-
actions and indicate that the binding to the short site
is essentially the same as to longer sites. In any case,
the data clearly show that the N-terminal arms are not
important for high-aﬃnity binding to these single site
operators.
Interestingly, like Ppar, the promoters for PtraL and PtraA
contain two consecutive TGACA motifs that multiple
ArtA molecules might bind. However, modeling shows
that two ArtA dimers cannot dock simultaneously onto
DNA-containing contiguous TGACA repeats such as in
Ppar, PtraL and PtraA without steric clash. These combined
data are consistent with the idea that dimeric ArtA is the
functional DNA-binding unit for these promoter
operators. Moreover, these data also indicate that, in
these cases, the long N-terminal arms of ArtA do not con-
tribute to DNA binding by either contacting the DNA or
participating in protein–protein interactions that aid
DNA binding. Indeed, FP experiments examining
binding to the full length promoter operators of Ppar,
PartA, PtraA and PtraL showed no diﬀerence in binding
aﬃnity between the wildtype and 14 mutant of ArtA
and the binding aﬃnities were essentially the same as
obtained for the single ArtA consensus site (Table 3).
The lower binding aﬃnity of ArtA for its operator in
Porf259 (790 nM compared with 127 nM for the optimal
site) may be explained by the fact that it contains a
single base diﬀerence compared with the consensus
ArtA-binding site (in position 9 in which the T is
changed to G). The phosphate group of this nucleotide
interacts extensively with N cap of a2 and these contacts
may be inﬂuenced by nucleotide identity (Figure 5D).
Notably, the reduced aﬃnity of ArtA for Porf259 is consis-
tent with the ﬁnding that Porf259 was the least sensitive of
the ArtA-regulated promoters (Figure 2). The ArtA
DNase I footprint data obtained for each of the six
ArtA-regulated promoters (Supplementary Figure S2;
Figure 3) are in good agreement with our FP data.
However, the protected regions determined here are
markedly smaller than those described previously for the
ArtA homolog, TrsN (11). The larger footprints observed
in that study, however, are likely attributable to the much
larger TrsN fusion protein, which contained a glutathione
S-transferase aﬃnity tag.
Interestingly, one operator bound by ArtA, Porf538, pre-
sented a paradox. Although this site is regulated by ArtA,
an obvious consensus site within the promoter is unclear.
Two possible matches that are close to the consensus were
identiﬁed (Figure 3; Table 3). Individually, neither of these
sites showed detectable binding as measured by FP.
However, the 21-mer oligonucleotide, which covers both
sites was found to bind wild-type ArtA saturably, with a
Kd of 58 nM. Because this site contains two possible

binding motifs (Table 3) but neither is suﬃcient for DNA
binding, we reasoned that this site might bind two ArtA
dimers. Indeed, modeling revealed that two ArtA dimers
would bind on the same side of the DNA duplex on this
operator (Supplementary Figure S4). This binding mode
shows no steric clash and critically, the N-terminal arm of
one subunit is juxtaposed next to the adjacent molecule in
the neighboring dimer, suggesting that ArtA may utilize
its N-terminal arms in protein–protein interactions when
binding to Porf538. If this is the case, the ArtA truncation
mutant should display weakened binding to this site.
Indeed, FP experiments showed that removal of the
N-terminal arms essentially abrogated binding to the
21-mer Porf538 site (Figure 6). To further test the Porf538
dimer-of-dimer model, two Porf538 mutants were designed

2: ACACGACATGAAATTAAACGT). In each of these
oligonucleotides, the two key bases involved in H20 rec-
ognition (G and C) were mutated (G to T and C to A). As
predicted, none of these mutant oligonucleotides were
bound by ArtA, consistent with the previous result that
ArtA cannot bind either 12-mer oligonucleotide with only
one binding site derived from Porf538. In contrast, as noted,
previous FP experiments revealed that both14 ArtA and
wild-type ArtA bound the full length promoter regions of
Ppar, PartA, PtraA and PtraL with the same aﬃnity as the
single ArtA consensus site, consistent with a single ArtA
dimer binding to these promotors.
Finally, we utilized FP to directly ascertain the
stoichiometry of ArtA binding to the Porf538 site and to
the consensus operator site. These studies, which showed
that two ArtA subunits (i.e. a ArtA dimer) bound the con-
sensus operator site, while Porf538 is bound by four ArtA
subunits, are consistent with the model that ArtA binds
Porf538 as a dimer-of-dimers and the consensus sites as
only a dimer (Figure 7). While the inﬂection point on the
ArtA-consensus site curve is typical of most DNA-binding
proteins in that, after all the DNA sites are saturated, the
curve is primarily ﬂat, it is interesting that although the
inﬂection point in the ArtA–Porf538 curve is clear and
indicates saturation of the speciﬁc sites by four ArtA
subunits, addition of more ArtA protein in this case does
not lead to a ﬂat curve but an additional increase. This
suggests that after the speciﬁc sites are saturated, more
ArtA molecules non-speciﬁcally interact with either the
protein or the DNA. Thus, the combined data show that
ArtA binds DNA utilizing diﬀerent modes of binding. In
the case of the Ppar, PartA, PtraA, PtraL and Porf259 operators,
ArtA binds as a dimer and there are no protein–protein
interactions involved in this binding outside the contacts
between subunits in the dimer. In contrast, ArtA binds to
the atypical Porf538 operator as a dimer-of-dimers and
utilizes, in addition to its RHH, its extended N-terminal
arms, presumably for mediating dimer–dimer contacts.
ArtA transcription repression mechanism
Notably, the ArtA-binding sites within the Ppar, PartA,
PtraA and PtraL promoters overlap the 35 motifs, while
the ArtA-binding site within the Porf259 promoter is
located slightly downstream of the 35 position. Finally,
the ArtA-binding site within the Porf538 promoter, which
we ﬁnd ArtA binds as a dimer-of-dimers, extends over the
entire 35 box. Thus, all the ArtA-binding sites overlap or
impinge on the 35 boxes of the promoters that it
regulates. This suggested that ArtA may repress transcrip-
tion by preventing binding of the sigma factor. Regions 4
of sigma factors, which specify binding to the 35 boxes
of the promoters, are very conserved among bacteria
(3436). The structure of the Thermus aquaticus sigma
Region 4–DNA complex has been solved and can serve

as a model for the S. aureus sigma Region 4–DNA
complex as the two share 79% sequence similarity and
importantly, all the residues involved in 35 box
binding are identical between the two proteins (36). The
nucleotides within the 35 box in the promoters bound by
ArtA are ATGACA instead of the typical 35 TTGACA.
Superposition of the T. aquaticus Sigma A Region
4–DNA complex onto ArtA–DNA complex using the
conserved TGACA 35 box region as a guide shows
explicitly that binding of ArtA would completely block
the binding of Region 4 of S. aureus sigma factor A at
the 35 box (Figure 8). Furthermore, the DNA distortion
induced by ArtA binding would also hinder the accessibil-
ity of the sigma factor. Thus, these data indicate that ArtA
represses transcription by physically blocking access of
the promoter to the sigma factor and by altering the
DNA conformation such that sigma binding would be
unfavorable.
DISCUSSION
We have shown here that ArtA represses six promoters in
Region 1 and the tra region of pSK41. All but PartA itself
and Porf259 are likely to direct transcription of operons. As
a consequence, ArtA is expected to regulate the expression
of 21 out of a total of 30 coding sequences contained
within the pSK41 backbone (Figure 1). It should be
noted that the only operon promoter not regulated by
ArtA, Porf204, corresponds to an example of an IS257-
hybrid promoter where the 35 sequence is located
within the terminal inverted repeat of the upstream
IS257 that is partnered to a fortuitously located 10
sequence present in the ﬂanking sequence. Such IS257-
hybrid promoters have previously been shown to direct
transcription of resistance genes (37,38). It was
hypothesized that the acquisitions of IS257 elements and
associated resistance genes are recent evolutionary events
and that Region 1 and the tra region were previously con-
tiguous in a pSK41 ancestor (6). If correct, it is likely that
transcription of orf204 and orf423 would have initiated at
PtraL, and hence would also have been under the control of

ArtA. With regard to this, it is worth noting that pSK41-
like plasmids have now been identiﬁed where the Region 1
and tra region termini evident in pSK41 are indeed con-
tiguous. In the mupirocin resistance plasmid pV030–8
(GenBank entry EU366902), the truncated remnant
present at the end of the pSK41 tra region, orf55
(Figure 1), corresponds to a 242 codon ORF, which is
immediately followed by a 207 codon ORF and then
orf204 and orf423 homologues. Therefore, in pV030–8
PtraL probably directs transcription of a six gene operon.
Transposon mutagenesis and complementation studies
of pGO1 indicate that trsL and/or trsM are required for
conjugative transfer (39), so these co-transcribed genes
may likewise be associated with this function. Although
the majority of ArtA-regulated genes are involved in
conjugative transfer, ArtA also participates in the repres-
sion of Ppar, which transcribes the functional parMR
type II partitioning system. This operon is also auto-
regulated by the centromere binding protein ParR,
which like ArtA, contains a RHH DNA-binding fold
(10). Thus, transcription of the par operon is subject to
two levels of control, mediated by two diﬀerent proteins
that utilize RHH folds speciﬁc for distinct DNA-binding
sites.
The RHH DNA-binding motif is a common DNA-
binding motif found in prokaryotes (23). Indeed, 2000
RHH-domain containing protein sequences have been
identiﬁed. To date, >15 structures have been determined
of RHH proteins in their apo or DNA-bound forms. A
characteristic feature of most RHH proteins is that they
recognize their DNA sites by forming dimer-of-dimers.
This increases speciﬁcity in DNA binding through the for-
mation of DNA base contacts from two dimeric modules
as a single RHH module can only specify 6 nt in one
major groove. Indeed, several RHH proteins have been
shown to bind cooperatively to extended DNA segments
to form superstructures on DNA. This was ﬁrst demon-
strated for the RHH protein CopG (40). Subsequently,
such cooperative binding by the pSK41 ParR protein
was shown to lead to the formation of a speciﬁc
superhelical partition complex that is critical for plasmid
DNA segegation by the type II ParR-ParM proteins (10).
Therefore, it is interesting that ArtA appears to display
altered ability in how it binds DNA in that it functionally
represses most of its promoters by binding as a dimer, but
can also bind a non-canonical DNA operator as a dimer-
of-dimers.
The formation of ArtA dimer-of-dimers was shown
to be dependent on its N-terminal arm regions. Long
N-terminal regions have been found in the RHH
proteins MetJ, ParR and Omega repressor (10,24,25).
However, in these proteins, the N-terminal arms play
diﬀerent roles than they do in ArtA. Speciﬁcally, the
N-terminal regions of MetJ fold back and interact with
Helix 2 and are involved in binding to the MetJ
corepressor, S-adenosylmethionine and the N-terminal
regions of ParR and the Omega repressor are known to
interact with their respective partition NTPase partner
proteins, ParM and Delta, respectively (10,25,26). Thus,
the utilization of N-terminal arms to mediate RHH
dimer-of-dimer interactions is so far unique to ArtA.
The formation of dimer-of-dimers by other RHH
proteins has been shown to involve diﬀerent regions and
sometimes domains of each protein. Examples include Arc
(27), MetJ (24), NikR (28), FitAB (29) and ParR (10). In
these cases, the binding sites for each dimer are normally
arranged as inverted repeats. In contrast, the ArtA-
binding sites in Porf538 are arranged as direct repeats.
One further example of a RHH protein that appears to
function as a dimer in DNA binding is the E. coli proline
utilization protein A (PutA). However, the only other
RHH protein that may function similarly to ArtA in
being capable of binding as a dimer or dimer-of-dimers
is the F plasmid TraY protein (41). Although the structure
of TraY has not yet been solved, the protein sequence
contains two direct repeats that are predicted to each
contain a RHH-fold. If this is the case, TraY forms a
monomeric RHH2-fold. Biochemical studies have
suggested that it can bind either as a monomer (mimicking
a RHH dimer) or a dimer (mimicking a RHH dimer of
dimers). Whether these proposed modes of binding are
relevant in vivo, however, has not yet been determined.
Although the RHH proteins, Mnt repressor and ParR
contain histidines in their ribbon, ArtA is the ﬁrst RHH
protein observed to utilize histidine as its primary
sequence specifying residue. In the ParR–DNA structure,
the side chain of ParR residue H8 faces the hydrophobic
core rather than the DNA and although biochemical data
suggest that Mnt uses H6 for DNA contacts, there are no
structures available for a Mnt–DNA complex, so this
remains to be determined (10,32). ArtA is notable in
that not only does it utilize H20 in base contacts, but, in
fact, it also relies on this residue for mediating almost all
its base specifying interactions. The histidine side chain is
somewhat unique in that it has the ability to form
hydrophobic contacts, stacking interactions and multiple
hydrogen bonds all of which can result in a speciﬁc inter-
action with a given ligand depending on the binding
context. In ArtA, the H20 residues make stacking
interactions with the central ﬁve nucleotides. Stacking
interactions between aromatic residues and nucleobases
have recently been suggested to play important roles in
speciﬁc binding of proteins to their DNA targets (42,43).
In addition, the H20 residues also make speciﬁc
hydrophobic interactions with the methyl groups of
thymine 4A and thymine 6B. Finally, the 2-fold related
H20s also hydrogen bond with guanine 5A and guanine
7B. As a result, the ArtA H20 residues alone are able to
almost entirely mediate speciﬁc operator binding.
Our FP and footprinting studies show that ArtA binds
operator sites that overlap or are next to the 35 box of
each promoter suggesting that ArtA may function to
repress transcription by physically blocking binding of
Sigma A to these promoters. Modeling shows clearly
that ArtA and Sigma A cannot bind the 35 region
simultaneously. Moreover, ArtA also alters the DNA
structure to one that is not favorably bound by Sigma
A, Region 4. Thus, together these ﬁndings provide a mech-
anism for ArtA-mediated transcription repression.
The data presented indicates that ArtA coordinately
regulates the expression of most cognate pSK41 coding
sequences via transcriptional repression. The genes
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 20 6981
controlled include plasmid housekeeping functions such as
plasmid partitioning and conjugation, as well as genes for
which functions are yet to be ascribed. ArtA presumably
sets a basal level of activity from its target promoters,
which may be subject to additional levels of control, as
in the case of Ppar. However, the possibility that the
expression or activity of ArtA itself might be subject to
exogenous control cannot be excluded. Tight control of
plasmid gene expression is expected to enhance evolution-
ary ﬁtness by reducing the burden of plasmid carriage on
the host cell. As such, the ArtA regulatory system, which
is highly conserved across the pSK41 plasmid family,
likely contributes to the capacity of these clinically signif-
icant plasmids to confer multiple and diverse anti-
microbial resistance phenotypes.
