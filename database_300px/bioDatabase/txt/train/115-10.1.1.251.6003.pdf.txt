FROBENIUS MANIFOLDS AND FORMALITY
OF LIE ALGEBRAS OF POLYVECTOR FIELDS
Sergey Barannikov, Maxim Kontsevich
Abstract. We construct a generalization of the variations of Hodge structures on
Calabi-Yau manifolds. It gives a Mirror partner for the theory of genus = 0 Gromov-
Witten invariants.
Introduction
Probably the best mathematically understood part of the Mirror Symmetry pro-
gram is the theory of Gromov - Witten invariants (see [KM]). In this paper we
will construct a Mirror partner for the genus = 0 sector of this theory. It may be
considered as a generalization of the theory of variations of Hodge structures on
Calabi-Yau manifolds.
One of the puzzles in Mirror symmetry was to find an interpretation of the mys-
terious objects involved in the famous predictions of the numbers of rational curves.
Such an interpretation should, in particular, give the meaning to the “extended”
moduli space H∗(M,Λ∗TM )[2], thought as generalized deformations of complex
structure. This moduli space should be equipped with the analog of the 3-tensor
Cijk(t) (“Yukawa coupling”) arising from a generalization of the variation of Hodge
structure on H∗(M). To find such structure is essential for the extension of the
predictions of Mirror Symmetry in the dimensions n > 3.
0.1 Background philosophy.
The Mirror Symmetry conjecture, as it was formulated in [K1], states that the de-
rived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau manifoldM is equivalent to the
derived category constructed from (conjectured) Fukaya category associated with
the dual Calabi-Yau manifold M˜ . The conjecture implies existence of the struc-
ture of Frobenius manifold on the moduli space of A∞-deformations of the derived
category of coherent sheaves on M . This structure coincides conjecturally with the
Frobenius structure on formal neighborhood of zero in H∗(M˜,C) constructed via
Gromov-Witten classes of the dual Calaby-Yau manifold M˜ .

0.2 Formulation of the results.
Consider the differential graded Lie algebra
t =
⊕
k
tk, tk =
⊕
q+p−1=k
Γ(M,ΛqT
∗
M ⊗ Λ
pTM ) (0.1)
endowed with the differential ∂¯ and the bracket coming from the cup-product on ∂¯-
forms and standard Schouten-Nijenhuys bracket on holomorphic polyvector fields.
Deformation theory associates a formal (super)moduli space Mt to the Lie alge-
bra t. It can be described informally as universal moduli space of solutions to
the Maurer-Cartan equation over Z-graded Artin algebras modulo gauge equiva-
lence. The formal moduli space Mt can be identified with a formal neighborhood
of zero in graded vector space H∗(M,Λ∗TM )[2]
1. The tangent sheaf to Mt after
the shift by [−2] has natural structure of graded commutative associative algebra
over OMt . In this note we show that this algebra structure gives rise to the struc-
ture of (formal) Frobenius manifold on H∗(M,Λ∗TM )[2]. More specifically, using
a universal solution to the analog of Maurer-Cartan equation in t, we construct
generalized holomorphic volume element for generalized deformations of complex
structure. The integrals of this element, which can be thought of as generalized
periods, produce the Frobenius manifold structure on H∗(M,Λ∗TM )[2].
0.3 Connection with A∞-deformations of D
bCoh(M).
The Formality theorem (see [K2]) identifies the germ of the moduli space of A∞-
deformations of the derived category of coherent sheaves on M with the moduli
spaceMt. The tangent bundle of this moduli space after the shift by [−2] has nat-
ural structure of the graded commutative associative algebra. The multiplication
arises from the Yoneda product on Ext-groups. The identification of moduli spaces
provided by the Formality theorem respects the algebra structure on the tangent
bundles of the moduli spaces. This implies, in particular, that the usual predic-
tions of numerical Mirror Symmetry can be deduced from the homological Mirror
Symmetry conjecture proposed in [K1]. We hope to elaborate on this elsewhere.
1. Frobenius manifolds
Remind the definition of formal Frobenius (super) manifold as given in [D], [M],
[KM]. LetH be a finite-dimensional Z2-graded vector space overC.
2 It is convenient
to choose some set of coordinates xH = {x
a} which defines the basis {∂a := ∂/∂x
a}
of vector fields. One of the given coordinates is distinguished and is denoted by
x0. Let A
c
ab ∈ C[[xH]] be a formal power series representing 3-tensor field, gab be
a nondegenerate symmetric pairing on H. To simplify notations in superscripts we
replace deg (xa) by a¯.
One can use the Acab in order to define a structure of C[[xH]]-algebra on H ⊗
C[[xH]], the (super)space of all continuous derivations of C[[xH]], with multiplica-
tion denoted by ◦:
∂a ◦ ∂b :=
∑
c
Acab∂c
1For a graded object t denote t[n] the tensor product of t with the trivial object concentrated
in degree −n.
2One can use an arbitrary field of characteristic zero instead of C everywhere
FROBENIUS MANIFOLDS AND FORMALITY OF LIE ALGEBRAS 3
One can use gab to define the symmetric C[[xH]]-pairing on H⊗ C[[xH]]:
〈∂a, ∂b〉 := gab
These data define the structure of formal Frobenius manifold on H iff the fol-
lowing equations hold:
(1) (Commutativity/Associativity)
∀a, b, c Acba = (−1)
a¯b¯Acab (1a)
∀a, b, c, d
∑
e
AeabA
d
ec = (−1)
a¯(b¯+c¯)
∑
e
AebcA
d
ea (1b)
equivalently, Acab are structure constants of a supercommutative associative
C[[xH]]-algebra
(2) (Invariance) Put Aabc =
∑
eA
e
abgec
∀a, b, c Aabc = (−1)
a¯(b¯+c¯)Abca ,
equivalently, the pairing gab is invariant with respect to the multiplication ◦
defined by Acab.
(3) (Identity)
∀a, b Ab0a = δ
b
a
equivalently ∂0 is an identity of the algebra H⊗ C[[xH]]
(4) (Potential)
∀a, b, c, d ∂dA
c
ab = (−1)
a¯d¯∂aA
c
db ,
which implies, assuming (1a) and (2), that the series Aabc are the third deriva-
tives of a single power series Φ ∈ H⊗ C[[xH]]
Aabc = ∂a∂b∂cΦ
2. Moduli space via deformation functor
The material presented in this section is standard (see [K2] and references
therein).
Let us remind the definition of the functor Defg associated with a differential
graded Lie algebra g . It acts from the category of Artin algebras to the category
of sets. Let A be an Artin algebra with the maximal ideal denoted by m. Define
the set
Defg(A) := {dγ +
[γ, γ]
2
= 0|γ ∈ (g⊗m)1}/Γ0A
where the quotient is taken modulo action of the group Γ0A corresponding to the
nilpotent Lie algebra (g ⊗ m)0. The action of the group can be described via the
infinitesimal action of its Lie algebra:
α ∈ g⊗m → γ˙ = dα+ [γ, α]
Sometimes functor Defg is represented by some topological algebra OMg (pro-
jective limit of Artin algebras) in the sense that the functor Defg is equivalent to
4 SERGEY BARANNIKOV, MAXIM KONTSEVICH
the functor Homcontinuous(OMg , · ). For example, H
0(g) = 0 is a sufficient condi-
tion for this. If Defg is representable then one can associate formal moduli space
to g by defining the “algebra of functions” on the formal moduli space to be the
algebra OMg .
We will need the Z-graded extension of the functor Defg. The definition of
DefZg is obtained from the definition of Defg via inserting Z−graded Artin algebras
instead of the usual ones everywhere. A sufficient and probably necessary condition
for the functor DefZg to be representable is that g must be quasi-isomorphic to an
abelian graded Lie algebra. We will see in §2.1 that this is the case for g = t. Hence
one can associate formal (graded) moduli space3 Mt to the Lie algebra g.
2.1 Extended moduli space of complex structure.
LetM be a connected compact complex manifold of dimension n, with vanishing
1-st Chern class c1(TM ) = 0 ∈ Pic(M). We assume that there exists a Ka¨hler metric
onM , although we will not fix it. By Yau’s theorem there exists a Calabi-Yau metric
on M .
It follows from the condition c1(TM ) = 0 there exists an everywhere nonvanishing
holomorphic volume form Ω ∈ Γ(X,ΛnT ∗M ). It is defined up to a multiplication by
a constant. Let us fix a choice of Ω. It induces isomorphism of cohomology groups:
Hq(M,ΛpTM ) ≃ H
q(M,Ωn−p); γ 7→ γ ⊢ Ω. Define differential ∆ of degree −1 on
t by the formula :
(∆γ) ⊢ Ω = ∂(γ ⊢ Ω)
The operator ∆ satisfies the following identity (Tian-Todorov lemma) :
[γ1, γ2] = (−1)
degγ1+1(∆(γ1 ∧ γ2)− (∆γ1) ∧ γ2 − (−1)
degγ1+1γ1 ∧∆γ2) (2.1)
where degγ = p+ q − 1 for γ ∈ Γ(M,ΛqT¯ ∗M ⊗ Λ
qTM ).
Denote by H the total homology space of ∆ acting on t[1]. Let {∆a} denote a
graded basis in the vector space ⊕p,qH
q(M,ΛpTM ), ∆0 = 1 ∈ H
0(M,Λ0TM ) . Let
us redefine the degree of ∆a as follows
|∆a| := p+ q − 2 for ∆a ∈ H
q(M,ΛpTM )
Then {∆a} form a graded basis in H. Denote by {t
a}, ta ∈ H∗, deg ta = −|∆a|
the basis dual to {∆a}. Denote by C[[tH]] the algebra of formal power series on
Z-graded vector space H.
Lemma 2.1. The functor DefZ
t
associated with t is canonically equivalent to the
functor represented by the algebra C[[tH]].
Proof. It follows from (2.1) that the maps
(t, ∂¯)← (Ker∆, ∂¯)→ (H[−1], d = 0) (2.2)
are morphisms of differential graded Lie algebras. Then the ∂∂¯-lemma, which says
that
Ker ∂¯ ∩Ker∆ ∩ (Im∆⊕ Im ∂¯) = Im∆ ◦ ∂¯, (2.3)
shows that these morphisms are quasi-isomorphisms (this argument is standard in
the theory of minimal models, see [DGMS]). Hence (see e.g. theorem in §4.4 of [K2])
the deformation functors associated with the three differential graded Lie algebras
are canonically equivalent. The deformation functor associated with trivial algebra
(H[−1], d = 0) is represented by the algebra C[[tH]]. 
3We will omit the superscript Z where it does not seem to lead to a confusion.
FROBENIUS MANIFOLDS AND FORMALITY OF LIE ALGEBRAS 5
Corollary 2.2. The moduli space Mt associated to t is smooth. The dimension of
Mt is equal to
∑
p,q dim H
q(M,ΛpTM ) of the dimension of the space of first order
deformations associated with t.
Remark. The Formality theorem proven in [K2] implies that the differential graded
Lie algebra controlling the A∞-deformations of D
bCoh(M) is quasi-isomorphic to
t. Here we have proved that t is quasi-isomorphic to an abelian graded Lie algebra.
Therefore, the two differential graded Lie algebras are formal, i.e. quasi-isomorphic
to their cohomology Lie algebras endowed with zero differential.
Corollary 2.3. There exists a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation
∂¯γˆ(t) +
[γˆ(t), γˆ(t)]
2
= 0 (2.4)
in formal power series with values in t
γˆ(t) =

∑
a1,a2
γˆa1a2t

such that the cohomology classes [γˆa] form a basis of cohomology of the complex
(t, ∂¯)
Remark. The deformations of the complex structure are controlled by the differen-
tial graded Lie algebra
t(0) :=
⊕
k
tk(0), t
k
(0) = Γ(M,Λ
kT
∗
M ⊗ TM )
The meaning of this is that the completion of the algebra of functions on the
moduli space of complex structures onM represents Deft(0) (or Def
Z
t(0)
restricted to
the category of Artin algebras concentrated in degree 0). The natural embeddings
t(0) →֒ t induces embedding of the corresponding moduli spaces. In terms of the
solutions to Maurer-Cartan equation the deformations of complex structure are
singled out by the condition γ(t) ∈ Γ(M,Λ1T
∗
M ⊗ Λ
1TM ).
Remark. Similar thickening of the moduli space of complex structures were consid-
ered by Z. Ran in [R].
3. Algebra structure on the tangent sheaf of the moduli space
Let R denotes a Z-graded Artin algebra over C, γR ∈ (t⊗R)1 denotes a solution
to the Maurer-Cartan equation (2.4).
The linear extension of the wedge product gives a structure of graded commu-
tative algebra on t ⊗ R[−1]. Let γR be a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation
in (t ⊗ R)1. It defines a differential ∂¯γR = ∂¯ + {γ
R, ·} on t ⊗ R[1]. Denote the
cohomology of ∂¯γR by TγR . The space of first order variations of γ
R modulo gauge
equivalence is identified with TγR . Geometrically one can think of γ
R as a mor-
phism from the formal variety corresponding to algebra R to the formal moduli
space. An element of TγR corresponds to a section of the preimage of the tangent
sheaf. Note that ∂¯γR acts as a differentiation of the (super)commutative R−algebra
6 SERGEY BARANNIKOV, MAXIM KONTSEVICH
t ⊗ R[−1]. Therefore TγR [−2] inherits the structure of (super)commutative asso-
ciative algebra over R. This structure is functorial with respect to the morphisms
φ∗ : TγR1 → TγR2 induced by homomorphisms φ : R1 → R2.
Let γˆ(t) ∈ (t⊗̂C[[tH]])
1 be a solution to the Maurer-Cartan satisfying the con-
dition of corollary 2.3. It follows from this condition that the C[[tH]]-module Tγˆ(t)
is freely generated by the classes of partial derivatives [∂aγˆ(t)]. Therefore we have
Proposition 3.1. There exists formal power series Acab(t) ∈ t⊗̂C[[tH]] satisfying
∂aγˆ ∧ ∂bγˆ =
∑
c
Acab∂cγˆ mod ∂¯γˆ(t)
The series Acab(t) are the structure constants of the commutative associative
C[[tH]]-algebra structure on H⊗ C[[tH]][−2].

Remark. Note that on the tangent space at zero this algebra structure is given
by the obvious multiplication on ⊕p,qH
q(M,ΛpTM ). This is ”Mirror dual” to the
ordinary multiplication on ⊕p,qH
q(M,Ωp
M˜
).

5. Metric on TM
There exists a natural metric (i.e. a nondegenerate (super)symmetric OMt -linear
pairing) on the sheaf TMt . In terms of a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation
γR ∈ (t⊗ R)1 it means that there exists an R-linear graded symmetric pairing on
TγR , which is functorial with respect to R. Here TγR denotes the cohomology of
∂¯γR defined in §3. The pairing is defined by the formula
〈h1, h2〉 :=
∫
h1 ∧ h2 for h1, h2 ∈ TγR
where we assumed for simplicity that γR ∈ Ker∆ ⊗ R. It follows from (2.2) (see
also lemma 6.1) that such a choice of γR in the given class of gauge equivalence is
always possible.
Claim 5.1. The pairing is compatible with the algebra structure.

6. Flat coordinates on moduli space.
Another ingredient in the definition of Frobenius structure is the choice of affine
structure on the moduli space associated with t. The lemma 2.1 identifiesMt with
the moduli space associated with trivial algebra (H[−1], d = 0). The latter moduli
space is the affine space H. The affine coordinates {ta} on H give coordinates on
Mt. This choice of coordinates on the moduli space corresponds to a specific choice
of a universal solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation over C[[tH]].
Lemma 6.1. There exists a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation in formal
power series with values in t
∂¯γˆ(t) +
[γˆ(t), γˆ(t)]

such that
(1) (Universality) the cohomology classes [γˆa] form a basis of cohomology of the
complex (t, ∂¯)
(2) (Flat coordinates) γˆa ∈ Ker∆, γˆa1...ak ∈ Im∆ for k ≥ 2
(3) (Flat identity) ∂0γˆ(t) = 1, where ∂0 is the coordinate vector field corre-
sponding to [1] ∈ H[−1]
Proof. The theorem of §4.4 in [K2] shows that there exists L∞ morphism f ho-
motopy inverse to the natural morphism (Ker∆, ∂¯)→ H[−1] (for the definition of
L∞-morphism see §4.3 in [K2]). Put ∆(t) =
∑
a(∆a[−1])t
a , where ∆a[−1] denotes
the element ∆a having degree shifted by one. Then
γ(t) =
∑
n
1
n!
fn(∆(t) ∧ · · · ∧∆(t))
satisfies the conditions (1)− (2). To fulfill the condition (3) γ(t) must be improved
slightly. Define the differential graded Lie algebra K˜er as follows
(1) K˜eri = Ker∆ ⊂ ti for i ≥ 0
(2) K˜er−1 = Im∆ ⊂ t−1
Note that the algebra Ker∆ is the sum of the algebra K˜er and trivial algebra of
constants C⊗1[−1]. Let f˜ be a homotopy inverse to the natural quasi-isomorphism
K˜er→ H[−1]≥0. Put ∆˜(t) =
∑
a6=0(∆a[−1])t
a. Then
γˆ(t) = 1t0 +
∑
n

n!
f˜n(∆˜(t) ∧ · · · ∧ ∆˜(t))
satisfies all the conditions. 
Remark. Any two formal power series satisfying conditions of lemma 6.1 are equiva-
lent under the natural action of the group associated with the
Lie algebra (K˜er∆⊗̂C[[tH]])
0.
Remark. It is possible to write down an explicit formula for the components of
the morphism f in terms of Green functions of the Laplace operator acting on
differential forms on M .
8 SERGEY BARANNIKOV, MAXIM KONTSEVICH
Remark. After the identification of the moduli space Mt with H, provided by
lemma 2.1, the complex structure moduli space corresponds to the
subspace H1(M,Λ1TM ). In the case of classical moduli space of the complex struc-
tures on M the analogous lemma was proved in [T]. The coordinates arising on
the classical moduli space of complex structures coincide with so called ”special”
coordinates of [BCOV].

a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation satisfying conditions of lemma 6.1.
The parameters of a miniversal solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation over
C[[tH]] serve as coordinates on the moduli space. The specific choice of coordinates
corresponding to the solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation satisfying conditions
(1)-(2) of lemma 6.1 corresponds to choice of coordinates on moduli space that are
flat with respect to the natural (holomorphic) metric gab.
Claim 6.2. The power series 〈∂aγˆ(t), ∂bγˆ(t)〉 ∈ C[[tH]] has only constant term in
the power series expansion at t = 0.
Proof. 〈x, y〉 = 0 for x ∈ Ker∆, y ∈ Im∆. 
Notation. Denote gab := 〈∂aγˆ(t), ∂bγˆ(t)〉.
Thus we have constructed all the ingredients of the Frobenius structure on Mt:
the tensors Acab(t), gab and the coordinates {ta} that are flat with respect to gab.
Remark. The 3-tensor Acab(t) on Mt does not depend on the choice of Ω. The
2-tensor gab is multiplied by λ
2 when Ω is replaced by λΩ
Claim 6.3. The structure constants satisfy Ab0a = δ
b
a.
Proof. It follows from the condition (3) imposed on γˆ(t) 
We have checked that the tensors Acab(t), gab have the properties (1)-(3) from the
definition of the Frobenius structure. It remains to us to check the
property (4).
7. Flat connection and periods
Let γˆ(t) ∈ (t⊗C[[tH]])
1 be a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation satisfying
conditions (1)-(2) of lemma 6.1. Then the formula
Ω(t) := eγˆ(t) ⊢ Ω
defines a closed form of mixed degree depending formally on t ∈ H. For t ∈ H−1,1
γˆ(t) ∈ Γ(M,T ⊗ T ∗) represents a deformation of complex structure. Then Ω(t) is
a holomorphic n-form in the complex structure corresponding to t ∈ H−1,1, where
n = dimC M .
Let {pa} denote the set of sections of T ∗

ττ∂c (see §1). Note that the operators ∆ and ∂¯γˆ(t) acting on t⊗̂C[[tH]] satisfy
a version of ∂∂¯-lemma :
Ker∆ ∩Ker ∂¯γˆ(t) ∩ (Im∆⊕ Im ∂¯γˆ(t)) = Im∆ ◦ ∂¯γˆ(t) (7.3)
Equivalently, there exists decomposition of t⊗̂C[[tH]] = X0 ⊕ X1 ⊕ X2 ⊕X3 ⊕ Y
into direct sum of graded vector spaces, such that the only nonzero components of
∂¯γˆ(t), ∆ are isomorphisms ∂¯γˆ(t) : X0 7→ X1, X2 7→ X3; ∆ : X0 7→ X2, X1 7→ X3.
Differentiating twice the Maurer-Cartan equation (2.4) with respect to ∂τ and using
(2.1) one obtaines
∆(∂τ γˆ(t) ∧ ∂τ γˆ(t)−
∑
c
Acττ∂cγˆ(t)) = −∂¯γˆ(t)∂τ∂τ γˆ(t) (7.4)
It follows from ∂∂¯-lemma for ∆, ∂¯γˆ(t) and the equation (7.4) that there exist formal
power series ατ (t) ∈ t⊗̂C[[tH]] such that
∂τ γˆ(t) ∧ ∂τ γˆ(t)−
∑
c
Acττ∂cγˆ(t) = ∂¯γˆ(t)ατ (t),

Therefore

∑

It follows from the condition (1) imposed on γˆ(t) that Πi form a (formal) framing
of T ∗

Corollary 7.2. The connection ∇ is flat
10 SERGEY BARANNIKOV, MAXIM KONTSEVICH
Claim 7.3. The structure constants Acab satisfy the potentiality condition (4) in
flat coordinates.
Proof. If one puts symbolically ∇ = ∇0 +A then the flatness of ∇ implies that
∇0A+
1
2
[A,A] = 0
Notice that associativity and commutativity of the algebra defined by Acab imply
that
[A,A] = 0.
Therefore
∇0(A) = 0.

We have completed the proof of the fact that Acab(t) and gab define the Frobenius
structure on Mt in the flat coordinates {ta}.
Remark. In fact one can write an explicit formula for the potential of the Frobenius
structure. Let us put γˆ(t) =
∑
a γˆat

Then one checks easily that Aabc = ∂a∂b∂cΦ (see Appendix). In the case dimCM =
3, γˆ ∈ t−1,1 = Γ(M,T
∗
M ⊗ TM ) this formula gives the critical value of so called
Kodaira-Spencer Lagrangian of [BCOV].
Remark. Define differential Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra as Z2-graded commutative
associative algebra A equipped with odd differentiation ∂¯, ∂¯2 = 0 and odd differ-
ential operator ∆ of order ≤ 2 such that ∆2 = 0, ∆∂¯ + ∂¯∆ = 0, ∆(1) = 0. One
can use the formula (2.1) to define the structure of Z2-graded Lie algebra on ΠA.
Assume that the operators ∂¯,∆ satisfy ∂∂¯-lemma (2.3). Assume in addition that A
is equipped with a linear functional
∫
: A→ C satisfying (4.1) such that the metric
defined as in §5 is nodegenerate. Then the same construction as above produces
the Frobenius structure on the Z2-graded moduli space MΠA. One can define the
tensor product of two such Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras. Operator ∆ on A1 ⊗A2 is
given by ∆1 ⊗ 1 + 1⊗∆2. Also, ∂¯ on A1 ⊗A2 is ∂¯1 ⊗ 1 + 1⊗ ∂¯2. It is naturally to
expect that the Frobenius manifold corresponding to A1⊗A2 is equal to the tensor
product of Frobenius manifolds corresponding to A1, A2, defined in [KM] in terms
of the corresponding algebras over operad {H∗(M0,n+1)}.

Note that the vector field E is conformal with respect to the metric gab. Therefore
the proposition 8. 1 shows that E is the Euler vector field of the Frobenius structure
on H (see [M]). Such a vector field is defined uniquely up to a multiplication by
a constant. The simplest invariant of Frobenius manifolds is the spectrum of the
operator [E, ·] acting on infinitesimal generators of translations and the weight of
the tensor Acab under the LieE-action. Usually the normalization of E is chosen so
that [E, ∂0] = 1.
In our case the spectrum of [E, ·] is equal to⋃
d
{1− d/2} with multiplicity
∑
q−p=d−n
dimHq(M,Ωp)
Note that this spectrum and the weight of Acab coincide identically with the cor-
responding quantities of the Frobenius structure arising from the Gromov-Witten
invariants of the dual Calabi-Yau manifold M˜ .
9.Further developments.
Conjecturally the constructed Frobenius manifold is related to the Gromov-
Witten invariants of M˜ in the following way. One can rephrase the present con-
struction in purely algebraic terms using Cˇech instead of Dolbeault realization of
the simplicial graded Lie algebra Λ∗TM . The only additional “antiholomorphic”
ingredient that is used is the choice of a filtration on H∗(M,C) complementary
to the Hodge filtration. The Frobenius structure, arising from the limiting weight
filtration corresponding to a point with maximal unipotent monodromy on moduli
space of complex structures on M, coincides conjecturally with Frobenius structure
on H∗(M˜,C), obtained from the Gromov-Witten invariants.
Our construction of Frobenius manifold is a particular case of a more general
construction. Other cases of this construction include the Frobenius manifold struc-
ture on the moduli space of singularities of analytic functions found by K. Saito,
the Frobenius manifold structure on the moduli space of “exponents of algebraic
functions”. The latter case is a Mirror Symmetry partner to the structure arising
from Gromov-Witten invariants on Fano varieties. All these cases seem to be re-
lated with yet undiscovered generalization of theory of Hodge structures. We hope
to return to this in the next paper.
