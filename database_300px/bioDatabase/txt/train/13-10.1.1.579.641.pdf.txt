ABSTRACT
We have used a combination of simulated annealing
(SA), molecular dynamics (MD) and locally enhanced
sampling (LES) methods in order to predict the
favourable topologies and loop conformations of
dimeric DNA quadruplexes with T2 or T3 loops. This
follows on from our previous MD simulation studies
on the influence of loop lengths on the topology of
intramolecular quadruplex structures [P. Hazel et al.
(2004) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 126, 16 405–16 415], which
provided results consistent with biophysical data.
The recent crystal structures of d(G4T3G4)2 and
d(G4BrUT2G4) (P. Hazel et al. (2006) J. Am. Chem.
Soc., in press) and the NMR-determined topology of
d(TG4T2G4T)2 [A.T.Phanetal. (2004)J.Mol.Biol., 338,
93–102] have been used in the present study for
comparison with simulation results. These together
with MM-PBSA free-energy calculations indicate that
lateral T3 loops are favoured over diagonal loops, in
accordance with the experimental structures; how-
ever,distinct loopconformationshavebeenpredicted
to be favoured compared to those found experiment-
ally. Several lateral and diagonal loop conformations
have been found to be similar in energy. The simula-
tions suggest an explanation for the distinct patterns
ofobserveddimer topology forsequenceswithT3and
T2 loops, which depend on the loop lengths, rather
than only on G-quartet stability.
INTRODUCTION
The increasing number of DNA G-quadruplex structures
determined by X-ray and NMR methods is revealing the
high degree of structural plurality available to quadruplex-
forming sequences. Parallel or antiparallel dimeric and
monomeric quadruplexes have been shown to form, with
loops being either parallel (1–4), lateral (5–8) or diagonal
(9–15). Structures with a mixture of loop types and
parallel/antiparallel strands are also common (16–19).
Potential G-quadruplex-forming G-rich sequences are found
in the telomeric regions of chromosomes, in which the extreme
30 end is single stranded. G-quadruplex structures formed from
various numbers of T2AG3 (1,2), T2G4 (6,18) and T4G4
(9,10,20) telomeric repeats from several organisms have
been the focus of studies using crystallography and NMR,
as well as several biophysical techniques. In addition there
is increasing evidence that the formation of G-quadruplexes is
not limited to telomeric regions, but may occur in G-rich
regions throughout the genome, either naturally or induced
through the binding of small molecules. This is exemplified
by a stable G-quadruplex formed by a G-rich sequence found
in the nuclease hypersensitivity element (NHE) III1 in a pro-
moter of the c-myc oncogene; this G-quadruplex has been
suggested to be involved in transcriptional regulation of the
c-myc gene (21,22). Many potential quadruplex-forming
G-rich sequences can be found in the human and other
genomes. They are much more varied than the tandem
telomeric repeat sequences above, and contain differing
G and loop residue length/sequence combinations (23–27).
The development of drugs to specifically target non-telomeric
G-quadruplexes will be aided by knowledge of the diverse
structures formed by different G-quadruplex sequences
(27–29).
In order to understand the factors governing the sequence-
dependent folding of G-quadruplexes, we have examined the
effect of loop length on intramolecular quadruplex structure
(30). We were able to show, using a combined molecular
dynamics (MD) and biophysical methods approach, that
loop length in certain situations is a determinant of
G-quadruplex structure, and specifically that sequences with
three single-nucleotide loops restrict intramolecular quad-
ruplexes to the formation of parallel structures, whereas one
single-nucleotide loop together with two longer loops can
potentially form both parallel and antiparallel structures.
Parallel quadruplex structures have now been found in several
sequences containing single-nucleotide loops (25,26),

including those derived from the c-myc promoter G-rich
sequence (3,4).
MD simulation methods are commonly used to investigate
G-quadruplex structures (31–34). The folding pathway of the
tetrameric G-quadruplex d(G4)4 has been studied using MD
simulations, and possible folding intermediates were sugges-
ted (33). Free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA
method showed that these intermediates were less stable
than the final folded structure. Detailed studies of the T4
loop conformation were also carried out, however these
have been less successful (34). These were unable to predict
the experimentally observed diagonal loop conformation, and
simulations of the experimental loop conformation were,
moreover, unstable. A concern when studying the T4 loop
in a quadruplex structure is the presence, as observed in the
crystal structure (9), of a loop-bound K+ ion, which is not
stable during MD simulations (34). This ion was not found
in an NMR study (11), although a more recent study (35) using
thallium ions (with a very similar ionic radius to potassium),
suggests that an ion may be present in the loop. The solution
structure (11) in K+ adopts a somewhat different loop
geometry. However this conformation was not predicted.
MD simulations are known to suffer from limitations when
these type of ionic effects are involved (31).
We have recently solved (P. Hazel et al. (2006) J. Am.
Chem. Soc., in press) the crystal structures of dimeric quad-
ruplexes formed from the sequences d(G4T3G4)2 and
d(G4
BrUT2G4), for comparison with the well-established struc-
ture of d(G4T4G4)2 (9). This last sequence forms an antipar-
allel dimeric quadruplex structure, with two diagonal T4 loops,
both in solution (10–12) and in the crystal (9,36). In contrast,
the crystal structures of the sequences d(G4T3G4)2 and
d(G4
BrUT2G4)2 show that they form dimeric quadruplexes
with lateral loops, either on opposite sides of the G-quartets
(head-to-tail dimer), or on adjacent sides (a head-to-head
dimer quadruplex structure was found for the d(G4
BrUT2G4)
sequence). In parallel with these crystallographic studies, we
have attempted to predict the structure adopted by the
sequences containing T3 loops, using MD simulations. The
crystal structures have also enabled the accuracy of the pre-
dicted structures to be assessed. Our crystallization trials with
the d(G4T2G4) sequence have not yielded any crystals to date;
however, simulation results on the quadruplexes potentially
available to this sequence have been compared with the NMR
structure of the closely related d(TG4T2G4T)2 quadruplex (6).
We report here on the use of a combination of in vacuo
simulated annealing (SA) and explicit solvent MD simulations
with locally enhanced sampling (LES) (37,38) to generate
favourable T2 and T3 loop conformations for dimeric quadru-
plexes. MM-PBSA free-energy calculations (39,40) have been
used to compare the resulting different loop structures. This
post-processing method allows absolute free energies to be
estimated from snapshots obtained during MD simulations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Oxytricha nova d(G4T4G4)2 crystal structure (9) was used
as a template for diagonal loop quadruplexes (PDB code
1JPQ). Lateral loop templates were generated from a previous,
though incorrect, d(G4T4G4)2 crystal structure (PDB code
1D59) (41), as this had the desired topology, and the
d(GCGGT3GCGG) NMR structure (PDB code 1A6H) (42).
The latter has two mixed G-C quartets in the centre of the
quadruplex. The C residues were replaced with G, and the
quartet stem equilibrated for 2 ns to relieve strain. Both lateral
loop templates (1D59 and 1A6H) have alternating syn-anti
glycosidic angles around the G-quartets, however the 1A6H
template has syn-syn-anti-anti conformations down each
G-strand, compared to syn-anti-syn-anti ones for the 1D59
template. The 1D59 template structure was used both
unaltered, and subsequent to a 2 ns MD equilibration, as
the crystal structure itself is in a high-energy conformation
(33). A model-built antiparallel G-quadruplex stem was also
included, containing two wide and two narrow grooves, and
alternating syn-anti glycosidic angles down the G-strands.
Parallel structures were generated from the d(TAG3T2AG3T)2
crystal structure, (PDB code 1K8P) (1) in which a fourth
G-quartet was added to the stem after removal of the loops.
The resulting structure was minimized to relieve strain in the
backbone. The d(G4T3G4)2 crystal structures (PDB id codes
2AVH and 2AVJ: Hazel et al., manuscript submitted) were
also used as templates for the simulations of quadruplexes
containing T2 loops. Schematic diagrams of the parallel, lat-
eral and diagonal loop dimeric quadruplexes are shown in
Figure 1.

All the initial model building and structural modifications
were carried out with the Insight II suite of programs (Mole-
cular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The T4 loops in the
1JPQ and 1D59 template structures were replaced with T3 or
T2 loops, and the backbones were minimized to relieve strain.
The 1A6H template already contains a T3 loop, which was
either kept as a starting structure, or modified to a T2 one. Loop
conformational space was searched with SA procedures using
the discover module of Insight II. During all SA runs the
residues involved in the G-quartets were kept fixed, and
only the loop residues were allowed to move. The SA runs
were carried out in implicit solvent, using a distance-dependent
dielectric (e ¼ 4r) to mimic the solvent. The initial loop con-
formation was minimized, then during each cycle the loop was
first heated to 1000 K over 2 ps, simulated at 1000 K for 2 ps,
cooled to 300 K for 1 ps and finally minimized. The next loop
conformation was generated from heating of the latest
minimized conformation.
The structures obtained from the SA runs were clustered
into conformational families, according to root mean square
(r.m.s.) deviation calculations between all structure pairs.
Pairwise r.m.s. deviations between all the structures were
calculated, then clustered according to the method used by
the NMRCLUST program (43). NMRCLUST was designed to
cluster NMR structures, and is therefore not able to handle the
large number of structures generated here in each SA run.
A Python script was written, which uses the same clustering
methodology, but with an unlimited number of input struc-
tures. Moreover, it was written to directly read in the output
files from the Insight SA runs, and output Insight format
archive files for each cluster. This script can be downloaded
from http://www.pascalehazel.org/cluster. Coordinates of the
most frequently occurring loop conformations generated
during SA runs are available as Supplementary Data. Bond
and angle energetic contributions for the initial model loops
were calculated using the Anal module of Amber 7 (44).
Selected structures from the clusters were subjected to more
lengthy MD simulations in explicit solvent using the Amber 7
program. Three K+ ions were placed, one between each
G-quartet stack, equidistant from the eight G O6 atoms,
when these were not present in the experimental template.
Further solution K+ ions were added to neutralize the system,
which was then solvated in a pre-equilibrated box of TIP3P
water. The box size depended on the system, but always exten-
ded at least 10 s from the solute in every direction. The
equilibration procedure consisted of 10 steps, beginning
with 1000 steps of minimization and 25 ps of dynamics of
the solvent only. The whole system was then minimized for
1000 steps, followed by 3 ps of dynamics with a restraint of
25 kcal.mol1 on the DNA. The DNA restraint was lowered by
5 kcal.mol1 during each of the next five 1000-step minim-
izations. Finally, the system was heated slowly to 300 K over
20 ps, with no further restraints. MD simulations were carried
out at 300 K, using a 2 fs time step, with SHAKE applied to
constrain the bonds containing hydrogen. The PME method
was used to deal with long range electrostatic interactions, and
Lennard–Jones interactions were cut off at 10 s. Similar
protocols were found to be reliable in previously reported
simulations of G-quadruplexes (32,33).
LES simulations were carried out on a subset of loop con-
formations. After an equilibration period of between 500 ps
and 1 ns of dynamics in explicit solvent, five copies of each
loop were generated using the Addles module of Amber. Both
the LES (loops) and non-LES regions (G-quartets) were main-
tained at 300 K, using separate water baths. LES simulations
were carried out in explicit solvent.
The MM-PBSA method was used to calculate approximate
free energies. Snapshots were collected every 20 ps for ener-
getic analysis. The electrostatic contribution to the solvation
free energy was calculated using the Delphi II program
(BIOSYM., San Diego, CA). Dielectric constants of 1.0 and
80.0 were assigned to solute and solvent, respectively. A grid
spacing of 0.5 s was chosen, with the longest linear dimension
of the molecule occupying 80% of this grid. The Amber
parm99 charge set and BONDI radii were used (45). All
MM-PBSA calculations explicitly included the three K+
ions within the quadruplex channel. The K+ radius was
determined to be 2.025 s, by adjusting it until (DGpolar +
DGnonpolar) was equal to the experimental DGsolvation of
80.6 kcal.mol1. All other energy terms were calculated
with the programs distributed with Amber. The solute entropic
contribution was estimated with the NMODE program, using
snapshots collected every 200 ps. Each snapshot was minim-
ized in the gas phase, using a distance-dependent dielectric of
e¼ 4r, before calculation of the vibrational mode frequencies.
The minimizations caused some distortion to the structures,
however this did not have a significant effect on the entropies
calculated. After LES simulations, the final loop copies were
averaged, and non-LES dynamics were carried out for at
least 1 ns. The MM-PBSA energies calculated can then be
compared to pre-LES energies.
RESULTS
SA
The SA runs generated large numbers of structures, and only
the most frequently repeated conformations were considered.
Results from the clustering of lateral T3 loop conformations
over both the wide and narrow grooves are shown in Figures 2
and 3, respectively. Lw indicates a lateral loop over the wide
quadruplex groove, as opposed to the narrow groove (Ln).
PDB files of the most frequently obtained lateral and diagonal
loop conformations are available as Supplementary Data. A
large number of loop structures generated were very solvent
exposed, with no stabilizing interactions between loop and G
residues, possibly due to the implicit solvent approximation
used during the simulations. However, these structures were
generally structurally very different from one another, and did
not appear in the final clusters created. Clusters containing
fewer than 5% of the total number of conformations were
not considered. Loop conformations containing stabilizing
interactions, such as stacking or hydrogen bonding, were
found to occur with greater frequencies than loop conforma-
tions with no such stabilizing interactions.
No difference in stability was found between the quad-
ruplexes with different lateral and diagonal T3 loop types.
However, both diagonal and lateral (over the wide quadruplex
groove) T2 loops were found to be strained in the structures
obtained from the SA runs. Diagonal loops have to span an
average of 19.5 s in the G-quadruplex models considered,
and lateral (wide groove) loops span an average of 15.5 s

(C40 to C30 distances across the groove). As only the loop
residues were allowed to move during the conformational
search, no effects of the short loop length could be observed
on the G-quartets. However, the diagonal and lateral loops
over the wider groove themselves appeared to be somewhat
strained. This was apparent through the appearance of some
increased bond lengths, e.g. P-O30 or P-O50 distances of 1.7 s
rather than around 1.6 s, and was reflected in calculated
backbone bond energy contributions. For example T2 diag-
onal, lateral (wide groove) and lateral (narrow groove) loops
had backbone bond energies of 11.1, 11.0 and 2.3 kcal.mol1,
respectively. The T2 short loops were much less conforma-
tionally flexible than the T3 loops. Thus the lateral T2 loop over
the wide quadruplex groove formed only four different con-
formations, out of the 200 sampled. This limited number of
possible conformations, together with their reduced flexibility
suggests that their backbones are under strain. Lateral T2 loops
over the narrow quadruplex groove were much more flexible,
and many possible conformations were obtained. These have
to span an average C40 to C30 distance of 12.4 s. In this case,
the flexibility of the backbone suggests that the structures were
not under strain. These SA results suggest that T2 loops brid-
ging distances of 15 s and above are under strain.
Although SA methods in implicit solvent were useful to
generate many possible loop conformations, the stability of
the resulting conformations could not be assessed. Even if
the number of SA runs was large enough to be able to use
the number of times a structure appeared as an accurate indic-
ator of stability, no comparisons could be made between the
lateral and diagonal loop types. The total potential energies of
each system can be calculated using Insight II; however, these
are necessarily only approximate values. The calculations
include solvent effects using a distance-dependent dielectric,
which is only a crude approximation, and do not take entropy
into account. Moreover, only the loop residues were allowed to
move during the conformational search, meaning that the
G-quartets could not respond to any pressure caused by
strained loop conformations. In order to further assess the
loop stability, fully solvated MD simulations were carried
out on a subset of structures. Due to the computational cost
of carrying out fully solvated MD simulations, only the most
favourable structures from the SA runs were considered.
MD and LES simulations
MD simulations of T3 and T2 loop quadruplexes were carried
out on a selected number of structures. The three most fre-
quently occurring T3 lateral loop conformations found
for the alternating syn-anti model dimeric quadruplex,
T3-Lw-1, T3-Lw-2 and T3-Ln-2, were considered. In the
T3-Lw-1 conformation, the middle T residue is in the quad-
ruplex groove, while the first and third T residues stack on the
G-quartet plane (Figure 2a). A structure with two loops in the
T3-Lw-1 conformation at each end of the quadruplex showed
no structural changes after 1 ns MD, apart from a slight move-
ment of the middle T residues out of the quadruplex groove.
A 4 ns LES simulation was carried out starting from the 1 ns
equilibrated structure. The two loops in the same starting

conformation behaved differently during the LES simulation.
The first loop remained in the same conformation throughout
the dynamics (Figure 4a). After about 2 ns, a structural
rearrangement of the second loop occurred so that the second
T residue, previously in the quadruplex groove, moved to stack
on top of the two other T residues (Figure 4c). This happened
gradually over a few 100 ps, and the second conformation was
stable for the remainder of the LES run. The new loop con-
formation was similar to the T3-Lw-5 structure in Figure 2e,
sampled during SA. Lowering of the energy barriers enabled
the third T residue to flip by 180 in both loops during LES
simulations, allowing potential hydrogen bonds to form
between the first and third T residues. However, the T residues
were only within hydrogen-bonding distance in the second
loop, and only after the conformational change to a T3-Lw-5
type structure. During these simulations, each loop conforma-
tion was stable over nanosecond timescales, even when using
the LES increased sampling method.
The SA runs generated several structures in which the first
T residue was positioned in the quadruplex groove (T3-Lw-2,
T3-Lw-4 and T3-Lw-6 in Figure 2). A 1 ns MD simulation of the
alternating syn-anti model quadruplex with two T3-Lw-2 loop
types suggested that the latter were less stable than the pre-
viously sampled T3-Lw-1 and T3-Lw-5 conformations. During
the initial 1 ns equilibration phase, the loop residues were very
flexible, especially the first and third T residues in the first
loop. The first T residue moved gradually out of the quad-
ruplex groove in the first few hundreds of picoseconds, and
then remained exposed to the solvent (Figure 4b). The second
loop in the same conformation was stable over the 1 ns MD
simulation. During the subsequent 2.7 ns LES simulation, both
loops rearranged to the conformations shown in Figure 4b and
d. Stacking of the second and third T residues was conserved
during the LES simulation, however the first T residue was
much more flexible. The final structures obtained are similar to
the T3-Lw-3 conformation from the SA runs, in which the first
T residue moves closer to stack with the other loop residues,
thus minimizing solvent exposure.
Quadruplex structures with the native 1A6H T3 loops were
simulated for 4 ns after mutation of the C residues to G in the
quadruplex stem. Multiple loop conformations are present in
the NMR structure, and the first PDB entry was chosen for
MD. In this, the first T residue is in the quadruplex groove, the
third T stacks on the G-quartets, and the second T is pointing
into the solvent. Within the first 400 ps of dynamics, the
second T residue of both loops formed stacking interactions
with either the G-quartets, or the third T residue, and these
were stable throughout the simulation. This is in accordance
with the NMR structures, with some having both second and
third T residues stacking with the G-quartets. The first T res-
idue remained within the quadruplex groove in only one of the
loops. In the second loop, this T residue moved into the solu-
tion, an arrangement corresponding to the second NMR struc-
ture in the 1A6H PDB entry. This simulation revealed that
a loop with the first T residue in the quadruplex groove can be
stable, although rearrangements to other conformations can
also occur (in the 1A6H simulation as well as the T3-Lw-
2 simulation described above). The T3 loops were flexible
in the NMR structure, and interchange between the different
experimental conformations was observed during the simula-
tions. The final loop conformations obtained were similar to
the T3-Lw-2 and T3-Lw-6 structures in Figure 2b and 2f. The
loop flexibility within the NMR structure suggests that the
conformational changes which occur during the simulations
are due to real structural flexibility of the loops, rather than
force field effects.
Lateral loops over the narrow quadruplex groove in the
T3-Ln-2 conformation were also simulated using MD. The
loop conformation remained unchanged during a 1 ns equi-
libration, with two residues forming a stack over the
G-quartets, and the first T residue slightly arranged within
the quadruplex groove. The loops were more flexible over
a 4 ns LES simulation, although no major rearrangements
were observed (Figure 4e). The individual loop copy r.m.s.
deviations were around 3.0 s, after fitting of the G-quartets;
however, the final structure was similar to the starting T3-Ln-2
conformation. As with several other simulations, the first
T residue, originally within the quadruplex groove, adopted
a slightly elevated position, in order to form interactions with
the other two loop residues.
A quadruplex with two diagonal T3 loops was subjected to
a 4 ns MD simulation. The two loops were found to behave

differently during the dynamics. One of the loops remained
in the same conformation throughout the dynamics, with the
first T residue bound deep within the quadruplex groove
(Figure 5a). On the other hand, the first T residue of the second
loop moved in and out of the quadruplex groove during the
dynamics. The motions of this latter loop also caused
a G-quartet to become distorted during the final few 100 ps
of simulation, when a G residue left the quartet plane, and
formed a hydrogen bond with a loop phosphate group oxygen
atom of the loop backbone (Figure 5b). This shows the import-
ance of carrying out lengthy simulations, as the loop con-
formation was stable for almost 4 ns before showing any
signs of distortion. This also revealed that simulations can
be sensitive to small changes in loop conformation, as the
first loop in essentially the same conformation was stable
during the whole simulation.
Most sampled loop conformations were stable over nano-
second timescales, however interchange between different
loop conformations was observed. Similar loop conformations
exhibited different behaviour within the same simulation,
suggesting that several T3 loop conformations are equally
possible. Unstable loops did not generally affect the stability
of the G-quadruplex stem, which always had lower r.m.s.
deviations. These results are encouraging in that there was
generally a good agreement between the conformations
found in the SA runs and during the dynamics. Conformations
adopted during the MD simulations were generally structurally
close to structures previously generated in the SA runs. The
diagonal loop simulation outlined some of the main difficulties
when using theoretical models as starting structures in MD
simulations. Small differences in loop conformation can lead
to major structural changes over long timescales, and it can be
difficult to establish whether the differences are due to the
general loop conformation or to the particular starting struc-
ture which was used. Both simulated lateral T3-Lw-3 loop
conformations suggested that having the first T residue located
within the quadruplex groove is not the most stable conforma-
tion, as rearrangements occurred. However, this conformation
was stable during a simulation of the 1A6H experimental
structure with T3 loops. The results from MD simulations
are therefore highly dependent on the initial starting structure.
MD simulations of quadruplexes with T2 loops were much
more dependent upon the loop type, compared to the T3 loop
simulations. The diagonal T2 loop quadruplex was very
unstable during the simulation. After only 400 ps of dynamics,
the G-quartet below the T2 loop was severely distorted, as
shown in Figure 6a. The strain caused by the short loop
was apparent from the very beginning of the simulation, as
the upper quartet G residues were forced closer together,
making them tilt inside the quadruplex, and causing

a K+ ion to move out from the channel and into the loop region.
These simulations suggest that dimeric quadruplexes with
diagonal T2 loops are unlikely to form in solution. The
same strain effect was observed for the lateral T2 loop over
the wide quadruplex groove, although this was less pro-
nounced than in the diagonal loop case. Figure 6c shows
a selected lateral T2 loop over the wider quadruplex groove
after 4 ns of dynamics. Over the course of the simulation, the
G-quartets became somewhat distorted, and not all Hoogsteen
hydrogen bonds between the guanine bases were maintained.
However, stacking between the G residues was mostly
conserved. On the other hand, the T2 lateral loop bridging
a narrow groove caused no distortion of the G-quartets
(Figure 6b), as was also suggested by the SA results. A parallel
T2 loop quadruplex was also stable over a 4 ns simulation
(Figure 6d). A K+ ion moved out of the quadruplex channel,
but remained at the channel exit for the duration of the
dynamics. A G-quartet was slightly out-of-plane, however,
overall, the quadruplex structure was unaffected. Thus, MD
simulations suggest that either parallel or lateral (narrow
groove) loops are likely to be preferentially formed by
short T2 loops.
MM-PBSA calculations
Using SA and MD, stable conformations with both lateral and
diagonal T3 loops were found. Absolute free energy calcula-
tions using MM-PBSA were carried out in order to energet-
ically rank the different structures, and the results are
summarized in Table 1. The total free energy Gtotal was
calculated for the structures simulated with MD in explicit
solvent. Gtotal was further subdivided into contributions
from each of the loops, following the method of Stefl et al.
(33). Gstem, Gstem+loop1 and Gstem+loop2 were each calculated,
and Gloop1 and Gloop2 were derived from Gstem+loop1  Gstem
and Gstem+loop2  Gstem, respectively. In this manner, the con-
tribution of the loop-G-quartet interaction is included in the
loop free energies. The data in Table 1 shows that all the loop
conformations are close in energy. This was also observed
during the dynamics as one loop type could rearrange to
another, although each was stable for several nanoseconds.
The LES simulations enabled more structural flexibility in
the loops, and free energies after the LES simulations are
generally lower than before the enhanced sampling. This
suggests that during the LES simulations, more favourable
loop conformations were formed. The T3-Lw-5 conformation
was the most favourable T3 loop obtained, with a free
energy of 461 kcal.mol1. Unfortunately, the Gloop values
are not significantly different enough to be used to compare the
stabilities of various loop conformations. Local fluctuations in
loop geometry had significant effects on the calculated free
energies at each step of the simulations, which tended to
overshadow the free energy differences between structurally
distinct loop types. Lateral T3 loops over the narrow and
wide groove of the quadruplex have similar energies,
suggesting that both topologies are equally possible. More-
over, the free energies of diagonal and lateral loops were also
similar, which does not allow differentiation between the
two. The separation of the free energy into loop and
quadruplex stem contributions is an approximation, which
adds further uncertainty to the energies calculated. However,
this approximation is necessary, as loop conformations
adopted at each end of the quadruplexes during the simulations
often differed, resulting in up to 10 kcal.mol1 difference
in free energy between the loops within a single quadruplex
(Table 1). The total free energy of the G-quadruplex
molecules does therefore not reflect the stability of individual
loop conformations.
The solute entropic contribution was not included in the
G values in Table 1, although the solvent entropy is implicitly
taken into account in the solvation energy term. The entropic
contribution is the least accurately calculated component of
the free energy, and was therefore included separately.
The entropy was calculated for the complete quadruplex
structures, and was similar for the different quadruplexes
considered. The entropic component is, however, important,
as its inclusion can in principle alter the ranking of quadruplex
energies.
MM-PBSA calculations were also carried out in order to
differentiate between the stable T2 lateral and parallel loop
quadruplexes which were obtained. The decomposition of the
free energy into loop and stem components, as used above, is
inappropriate in this case, due to the completely different
manner in which lateral and parallel loops interact with the
G-quartets. Antiparallel quadruplex loops (lateral or diagonal)
interact primarily with the G-quartet face. On the other hand,
the parallel quadruplex loops interact with the groove region of
the quadruplex. Only overall free energies of parallel and
antiparallel quadruplexes can therefore be compared. The lat-
eral (narrow groove) quadruplex was more favourable than the
parallel quadruplex, with Gtotal ¼ 4237 and Gtotal ¼ 4222
kcal.mol1, respectively. This was still the case when the
solute entropy was taken into account, as TS ¼ 539 and
TS ¼ 543 kcal.mol1, respectively. For the particular loop
conformations which were simulated, the antiparallel structure
was more stable than the parallel structure. However, this does
not imply that a more favourable parallel loop structure could
not be found.

DISCUSSION
Comparison of T3 experimental and predicted loops
Both X-ray (Hazel et al., manuscript submitted) and NMR (42)
structures of dimeric quadruplexes with T3 loops show a clear
preference for lateral over diagonal loop formation. The most
frequently occurring experimental conformation, in which
the first loop residue is in the quadruplex groove, and the
other two residues are located above the G-quartets, was main-
tained during MD simulations of both the crystal structure
and NMR lateral (wide groove) T3 loops (Figure 7a and b,
respectively). This preference was however difficult to repro-
duce in the simulations, as several loop conformations had
similar energies (Table 1). There may well be some energetic
contributions to these total energies that will favour one
type of loop over the other. However these calculations cannot
differentiate between these types. The contributions are
included in the calculations of total free energies, but overall
do not favour a particular structure. The most favourable T3
loop conformation, predicted using MM-PBSA calculations,
was a lateral loop; however, this conformation is not that
observed experimentally, in which the first T residue is located
in the quadruplex groove. Instead, the MM-PBSA calculations
favour a conformation in which all three loop residues are
stacked above the G-quartet planes (Figure 7c). This con-
formation was predicted to be more stable (by at least
6 kcal.mol1) than the experimental NMR conformation
(1A6H simulation), as calculated by MM-PBSA (Table 1).
Various simulations of the d(G4T3G4)2 crystal structures
have yielded loop free energies which were within a few
kcal.mol1 of the predicted T3 loop conformation (Hazel
et al., manuscript submitted). The most favourable experi-
mental T3 loop conformation, over the wide quadruplex
groove (shown in Figure 7a), is only 1 kcal.mol1 more
favourable than the predicted conformation; this is within
the MM-PBSA calculation error.
There is experimental evidence suggesting that T3 loops are
flexible, and able to adopt several distinct conformations. Thus
several loop conformations have been found by NMR methods
to exist in solution, although the overall loop conformation is
always conserved (with the first loop residue located within the
quadruplex groove, and the second and third residues above
the G-quartets) (42). Both lateral loops over the narrow and
wide quadruplex grooves were found in the d(G4
BrUT2G4)2
crystal structure, suggesting that these are indeed energetically
similar, as suggested here by the MM-PBSA calculations in
Table 1. However, the experimental results also suggest that
lateral T3 loops are favoured over diagonal loops. This was not
reproduced in the simulations, as diagonal and lateral loops
have similar computed energies.
Comparison of T2 predicted loops with NMR structure
It has been shown above that the conformations of T3 loops in
dimeric quadruplexes were difficult to predict with MD simu-
lations because a number of conformers were found to be
possible. This was not the case for dimeric quadruplexes
containing T2 loops, whose structures are constrained by
the limited span of the 2 nt loop. In this case, the particular
loop conformation is less important, as certain T2 loop struc-
tures were found to be unstable due to strain in the loop
backbone. The T2 loops were found to be unable to form
diagonal loops, and quadruplex structures with two lateral
loops over the wide quadruplex groove were also distorted
(Figure 6), using the d(G4T3G4) crystal structure (Hazel
et al., manuscript submitted) as a template, after replacement
of the T3 loops with T2. The d(G4
BrUT2G4) crystal structure has
two types of quadruplex dimer within the asymmetric unit of
the structure (Hazel et al., manuscript submitted), a head-
to-tail homodimer with both loops across the wide grooves,
and a head-to-head heterodimer with loops across the wide and
narrow grooves. The d(TG4T2G4T) sequence forms two
heterodimers, a head-to-tail and a head-to-head dimer both
with loops across a wide and a narrow groove (6). Both
these heterodimers have syn-syn-anti-anti G glycosidic angles
around the G-quartets. Simulations were carried out in order to
establish whether these dimerization difference could be the
consequence of the differences in loop length, rather than any
conformational differences in the G-quartets themselves. The
d(G4
BrUT2G4) crystal structures suggest that both G-quartet
core structures, with syn-anti-syn-anti (head-to-tail dimer)
and syn-syn-anti-anti (head-to-head dimer) G glycosidic
angles around the quartets, are equally stable.
A d(G4T2G4) head-to-head dimer, with loops over the
narrow and wide grooves was stable over a 4 ns simulation,
and the loop residues were able to form stacking interactions
with the G-quartets (Figure 8b). However, the head-to-tail
dimer, which has both T2 loops over wide quadruplex grooves,
became distorted during the simulation (Figure 8a). It there-
fore appears that the strain caused by a T2 loop bridging a wide
groove can be compensated for by the second loop bridging
a shorter distance. However, two T2 loops bridging wide
grooves are unstable. The stable head-to-head d(G4T2G4)
dimer simulated has the same topology as one of the
d(TG4T2G4T) solution NMR structures (6). The latter
sequence also forms a head-to-tail dimer in solution, however
this has a different topology to the d(G4T3G4) head-to-tail
dimer. It is possible for the different head-to-tail topologies
observed to be due to effects of the loop lengths, rather
than G-quartet stem stability. The simulations carried out
here tend to support this view. A head-to-tail dimer with

both loops over the wide groove, as formed by the d(G4T3G4)
sequence, cannot support two T2 loops without the G-quartets
becoming distorted. However, dimerization which enables T2
loops to bridge a wide and a narrow groove can lead to stable
structures. Strain caused by the loop length could therefore
explain the different head-to-tail dimers formed by 3 nt
compared to 2 nt loops.
One of the limitations of MD simulations of quadruplex
structures is their inability to differentiate between K+ and
Na+ ion binding within the channel. All simulations in this
work were carried out with K+ ions bound within the quad-
ruplex channel. This is in contrast to the d(TG4T2G4T) NMR
structure, which was determined in Na+ ion containing
solution. The different ions are, however, not expected to
affect the results, as strain was the dominant factor in the
simulations, and this is unlikely to be affected by different
channel ions.
CONCLUSIONS
We have shown here that dimeric DNA quadruplexes with
3 nt-loops can adopt a wide range of conformations. NMR
and crystal structures of quadruplexes with T3 loops indicate
a preference for lateral over diagonal loops. This was not fully
reproduced during the simulations. Even though the most
favourable T3 loop found was indeed a lateral loop, diagonal
loop conformations were found which had similar free ener-
gies. Moreover, simulations were unable to unambiguously
identify the favoured lateral T3 loop conformation found
both in the crystal and in solution. However, the small free
energy differences between the T3 loop types simulated are
also in accord with experimental findings. Thus NMR studies
of these structures have shown that the loop regions are flex-
ible, while loops over both the wide and narrow quadruplex
grooves were found in the d(G4
BrUT2G4) crystal structure. The
free energy calculations could therefore indicate real energetic
similarities between the different loop types. Loop flexibility
was also suggested by the structural transitions which occurred
in the loops during the simulations. However, it appears that
approximate calculations, such as MM-PBSA are not able to
reproduce accurately enough the small energy differences
between various loop conformations, in order to reliably
predict the most favourable conformations in solution.
Shorter T2 loops in these quadruplexes do restrict the
conformational flexibility of the quadruplexes. Simulations
suggested that the structures adopted by sequences with T2
loops in solution may be governed by loop length, rather than
only by the stability of the G-quartet cores. These simulations,
and the d(G4T3G4) X-ray structures solved by us, both suggest
that G-quartets, which have alternating syn-anti-syn-anti or
syn-syn-anti-anti G-glycosidic angles around the G-quartets
are equally stable. The structures of dimeric quadruplexes
formed by the d(G4T3G4) and d(G4T2G4) sequences are
most likely different due to the differing lengths of their
loops, which does not allow the dimerization of two strands
with T2 loops over the wide quadruplex groove.
These simulations emphasize the influence of loop length on
the folding of G-quadruplexes, in accord with earlier NMR
studies (46). This may be the dominant factor in the folding of
certain sequences, especially with short loops comprising one
or 2 nt. Preliminary crystal structure data on the d(G4T2AG4)
quadruplex (P. Hazel et al. (2006) J. Am. Chem. Soc., in press)
suggest that this adopts a structure very similar to d(G4T3G4),
with lateral loops having the same conformation. This
further emphasizes the innate importance of loop length,
and that the nucleotide composition of short loops may be
of lesser importance.
This study, together with our previous one (30) on the effect
of loop length on intramolecular quadruplex structure, shows
that valuable structural insights can be gained from MD simu-
lations. Although particular loop conformations are difficult to
predict, general features of quadruplex topology, especially
when caused by strained shorter loops, can be established with
relatively short time-scale simulations. Thus diagonal and
lateral (wide groove) T2 loop simulations showed G-quartet
distortion within the first few 100 ps of simulation. Unlike T4

loops, in which ion binding within the loop region can cause
difficulties in the simulations (32), crystal structures of quad-
ruplexes with T3 loops do not show any ion binding within the
loops. This absence of ion within the loop region means that
MD simulations are able to reproduce loop conformations
when the experimental structures are simulated.
