ABSTRACT
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPRs) constitute a particular family of
tandem repeats found in a wide range of prokaryotic
genomes (half of eubacteria and almost all archaea).
They consist of a succession of highly conserved
regions (DR) varying in size from 23 to 47bp,
separated by similarly sized unique sequences
(spacer) of usually viral origin. A CRISPR cluster is
flanked on one side by an AT-rich sequence called
the leader and assumed to be a transcriptional
promoter. Recent studies suggest that this struc-
ture represents a putative RNA-interference-based
immune system. Here we describe CRISPRFinder, a
web service offering tools to (i) detect CRISPRs
including the shortest ones (one or two motifs);
(ii) define DRs and extract spacers; (iii) get the
flanking sequences to determine the leader;
(iv) blast spacers against Genbank database and
(v) check if the DR is found elsewhere in
prokaryotic sequenced genomes. CRISPRFinder is
freely accessible at http://crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/

INTRODUCTION
Genomic structures corresponding to CRISPRs were
observed ﬁrst in 1987 in Escherichia coli (1) and were
subsequently reported in other organisms under diﬀerent
names [TREP (2), SRSR (3,4), DRVs (5), LCTR (6),
SPIDR (7)] until the CRISPR acronym was proposed by
Jansen et al. (8). The direct repeat sequences carry in
general a low level of palindromic symmetry; they are
remarkably well conserved within a species (up to 248
exact copies in Verminephrobacter eiseniae EF01-2).
However, one of the ﬂanking DRs is frequently truncated
or diverged (see Supplementary Data). The DR size varies
from 24 to 47 bp whereas the spacer sequence is generally
within the range of 0.6–2.5 the DR size. The originality
of spacers is that they apparently derive from conjugative
plasmids or bacteriophages (2,9–11). A prokaryotic
genome may harbour up to 16 CRISPR clusters with the
same or a diﬀerent DR. In a genome, a single CRISPR is
generally associated with a family of genes called cas for
CRISPR-associated (8,12), encoding proteins showing
functional similarity with components of the eukaryotic
RNA interference (RNAi) systems (13). In addition, it was
demonstrated in two archaea, Archaeoglobus fulgidus (14)
and Sulfolobus solfataricus (15), that the CRISPR locus
is transcribed into small RNAs (smRNA) probably
from one of the ﬂanking regions, the leader, acting as a
promoter. These observations and the viral origin
of spacers have led to the hypothesis that the CRISPR-
associated system (CASS) is a prokaryotic defence
mechanism against genetic aggressions (10,13,16). Within
species, CRISPRs may be present in a subset of strains,
where they sometimes show polymorphism. The DR and
the order of the spacers are well conserved, but the
number of motifs (DRþ spacer) diﬀers from strain to
strain. To better understand the mechanisms underlying
the CRISPRs’ evolutionary scenario, three evolution rules
were proposed by Pourcel et al. (10) and conﬁrmed by
Lillestol et al. (15): (i) polarized acquisition of spacers
near the leader sequence; (ii) random loss of motifs and
(iii) shared ancestry when spacers are identical.
CRISPRs’ in silico analyses started in 1995 (2) but no
speciﬁc stand-alone CRISPR software tool was created.
Several software were used by diﬀerent authors to identify
these particular repeats but usually a manual discard
of background was necessary, and generally some
CRISPR clusters were missed or neglected, especially the
shortest one (less than three motifs). This is the case, for
example, of Tandem Repeat Finder (17) when considering
a motif (DRþ spacer) as a degenerate repeat (10,18), or
Locating Uniform poly-Nucleotide Areas (LUNA),
a program for ﬁnding degenerate repeats in microbial
genomes on a desktop computer. The repeats can be
ﬁltered using several parameters including length, distance
and level of conservation. LUNA was used especially for
ﬁnding CRISPRs in archaea (4,15). Another program,
Patscan (19) a pattern-matching tool that searches
sequences ﬁtting the introduced pattern, was applied to

identify CRISPRs containing at least three (20) or four
exact direct repeats (8). PYGRAM (21) is a visualization
program browsing all the repeats in the submitted
genomic sequence and showing perfectly conserved
palindromic repeats as pyramids. The PYGRAM pro-
gram is mostly eﬃcient in visually displaying large
CRISPRs (CRISPRs with as many as seven motifs are
considered as being very short in this work) since they will
be recognized as a concentration of horizontal bars
referring to a group of co-occurring repeats that diﬀer
by only a few nucleotides. Finally, Haft et al. (12) used
REPﬁnd (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/reputer/),
a part of the REPuter package (22–24) and BLASTN to
identify smaller repeat clusters.
These programs are the most used tools in CRISPR
detection, although none of them is especially conceived
for this purpose. They require further manual manipula-
tions to eliminate background data (tandem repeats for
example) and importantly, do not deﬁne accurately the
DR consensus (due to errors on the boundaries). Recently,
two CRISPR- dedicated software tools were proposed,
CRT (http://www.room220.com/crt) and PILER-CR (25).
Both of them run fast and perform well in ﬁnding
CRISPRs. However, CRT results in a considerable
background since tandem repeats are considered as
putative CRISPRs and in addition, the same CRISPR is
sometimes detected more than once with diﬀerent
consensus DRs. PILER-CR has also some drawbacks
since it often misidentiﬁes the DR boundaries and omits
the truncated DR.
In addition, there is no user-friendly dedicated web site.
A specialized program to automatically identify CRISPRs
seems to be mandatory for their optimum, rapid explora-
tion and in-depth analysis, in order to increase the
eﬃciency of CRISPRs investigations. CRISPRFinder is
a web service oﬀering fundamental tools for CRISPR
detection, including the shortest ones, allowing an
accurate deﬁnition of the DR consensus boundaries and
extraction of the related spacers. It oﬀers also additional
tools to analyze the CRISPR loci: (i) obtain the CRISPR
and the ﬂanking sequences according to ﬂexible size;
(ii) make a blast of selected spacers or ﬂanking sequences
against the Genbank database and (iii) check if the DR is
found elsewhere in prokaryotic sequenced genomes. The
CRISPRFinder web interface is accessible through http://
crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/CRISPRﬁnder.php
METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION
CRISPRFinder core routines were developed in Perl
under Debian Linux. The input of the web tool is a
genomic query sequence of length up to 67Mb in
‘FASTA’ format. Possible locations of CRISPRs (con-
sisting of at least one motif) are detected by ﬁnding
maximal repeats. A maximal repeat (26) is a repeat that
cannot be extended in either direction without incurring a
mismatch. The total number of maximal repeats in a
sequence of size n is linear (less than n) which is interesting
since the computation may be done in linear time using a
suﬃx-tree-based algorithm. A CRISPR pattern of two
DRs and a spacer may be considered as a maximal repeat
where the repeated sequences are separated by a sequence
of approximately the same length.
The operation of the program can be divided into four
main steps summarized in Figure 1: (Step 1) browsing the
maximal repeats of length 23–55 bp interspaced by
sequences of 25–60 bp, (Step 2) selecting the DR consensus
according to a deﬁned score taking into account the
number of occurrences of the candidate DR in the whole
genome and privileging internal mismatches between the
DRs rather than mismatches in the ﬁrst or the last
nucleotides, (Step 3) deﬁning candidate CRISPRs after
checking if they ﬁt CRISPR deﬁnition, (Step 4) eliminat-
ing residual tandem repeats.
In the ﬁrst step, maximal repeats are found by the
software Vmatch (http://www.vmatch.de/), the upgrade of
REPuter (22–24). Vmatch is based on a comprehensive
implementation of enhanced suﬃx arrays (27) which
provides the power of suﬃx trees with lower space
requirements. A one nucleotide mismatch is allowed
permitting minimal CRISPRs with a single nucleotide
mutation between DRs to be found. Hereafter, the
obtained maximal repeats are grouped to deﬁne regions
of possible CRISPRs with a display of consensus DR
candidates related to each cluster.
The second step is aimed at retrieving the DR consensus
of each cluster. The diﬃculty resides especially in the
identiﬁcation of boundaries, which is very important to
extract the correct spacers and compare DRs. In fact,
the consensus DR is selected as the maximal repeat which
occurs the most in the whole underlying genome sequence
with respect to the forward and the reverse complement
directions (since two CRISPRs having the same
DR consensus may be in opposite directions). Thus,
ambiguity in the choice of a DR will be eliminated in the
case of presence of similar DRs in other CRISPRs of the
related genomic sequence. However, if occurrence num-
bers are equal, more than a single DR consensus candidate
are kept and later compared. Given a candidate consensus
DR, the pattern search program fuzznuc of the EMBOSS
package (28) is applied to get DRs’ positions in the
related cluster. As the ﬁrst or the last DR in a CRISPR
may be diverged/truncated, a mismatch of one-third of the
DR length is allowed between the ﬂanking DRs and the
candidate consensus DR, whereas smaller nucleotide
diﬀerences are allowed between the other DRs to take
into account possible single mutations. In case of multiple
DR candidates, a score is computed and the best one
(minimum) is picked. This score favours candidates which
are encountered more frequently, rather than consensus
DR showing less internal mismatches.
Once the DR consensus is determined, the correspond-
ing spacers (Step 3) are extracted according to the DR
boundaries determined previously. The spacer length is
not allowed to be shorter than 0.6 or longer than 2.5 times
the DR length. These sizes are in the range of CRISPRs
described in the literature.
The last step consists in discarding false CRISPRs.
Therefore, tandem repeats are eliminated by comparing
the consensus DR with the spacer if there is only
one spacer, or by comparing spacers between each other.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35,Web Server issue W53
The comparison is done with the CLUSTALW program
(29) and the percentage of identity between spacers is
not allowed to exceed 60%. Finally, candidates having
at least three motifs and at least two exactly identical
DRs are considered as conﬁrmed CRISPRs. The remain-
ing candidates are considered as questionable. These
should be critically investigated by, for example, checking
for intraspecies size variation of the locus.
INPUT AND OPTIONS
The query sequence must be in ‘FASTA’ format. Ns
characters are accepted, IUB/GCG letters (MRWSY-
KVHDBX) will be converted to Ns and considered as
mismatches but any other characters will be deleted.
One can either paste the genomic sequence into the input
ﬁeld or upload it from a ﬁle on the local machine.
Multisequence ﬁles are also allowed by the program and
will be treated independently. Users may use the default
version or click on the ‘advanced version’ link to set and
modify all the program parameters, which may be
especially useful for ﬁxing the DR size.
OUTPUT
After querying a genomic sequence by CRISPRFinder,
results are summarized in a table with the number
of conﬁrmed and questionable CRISPRs (Figure 2A).
A CRISPR locus is presented according to a colour code
showing DRs in yellow and spacers in diﬀerent colours.
The respective positions are displayed, in addition to links
to two ﬁles: a summary of the displayed properties
(number of motifs, DR consensus, positions, etc.) and
a fasta ﬁle containing the list of spacers. In addition,
a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) ﬁgure displays the
diﬀerent candidates’ location in the analysed sequence.

In the case of presence of CRISPR clusters, further
analysis may be done through three hyperlinks in the left
menu: (i) blast spacers against the Genbank databases
with a cutoﬀ of 0.1 for the E-value and a matching
length of at least 70% the queried spacer size (Figure 2B);
(ii) obtain CRISPR and ﬂanking sequences which are
especially useful to deﬁne the leader sequence. As the size
of the leader sequence depends on the species (it varies
from 100 to 500 bp), the retrieved sequence may be
manually modiﬁed by the user (Figure 2C) and (iii) display
identical DRs in other known CRISPR loci (Figure 2D).
This utility corresponds to a link to CRISPR database
(Grissa et al. submitted for publication).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
CRISPRFinder is a program that allows the identiﬁcation
of structures with the principal characteristics of
CRISPRs, the smaller being composed of a truncated or
diverged DR, a spacer and a complete DR. In their
analysis, Godde et al. (20) using Patscan had chosen to
retain only CRISPRs with at least three exact repeats
(eliminating CRISPRs constituted of a ﬁrst truncated
repeat plus two exact repeats) thus ignoring most
CRISPRs containing less than three spacers. Similarly in
the work by Durand et al.(21), the PYGRAM program is
mostly eﬃcient in visually displaying large CRISPRs.
Such stringent criteria were appropriate in order to avoid
ambiguities in early investigations which were essentially
describing these new structures. However, it is now
important, in order to better understand the evolution
and spreading of CRISPRs, to provide tools which will
not eliminate the smallest CRISPRs. This is what we chose
to achieve with CRISPFinder. The major drawback is that
when looking for the shortest structures, such as those
with a unique spacer, it is clear that the background of
spurious candidates can be very high. The output of
Patscan and CRT also contains a large quantity of noised
data that needs a manual treatment.
CRISPRFinder is accessible on the web and submission
is very simple. We provide several samples on the website
as demonstrators. Upon submission of the complete
genome of Aquifex aeolicus VF5 (sample1), ﬁve conﬁrmed
and ﬁve possible CRISPRs are displayed in the following
pages. On the contrary, while using the webservice for
Patscan (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/compbio/PatScan/),
it is necessary to ﬁrst deﬁne a pattern (which is not
straightforward) and it is not possible to seek for
CRISPRs in a single genomic sequence but rather in an
entire predeﬁned database. In addition, Patscan requires a
Sun machine for local implementation. Similarly,
PYGRAM only runs on linux systems and its installation
requires advanced skills. CRT requires either to install
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) or compile the source
ﬁles, and PILER-CR needs to be compiled before use.
A comparison between layouts of available online
programs (REPuter, Patscan, TRF) and of
CRISPRFinder is provided in the Supplementary Data.
To check that CRISPRFinder was eﬃcient in recover-
ing all the CRISPRs from a genome, we compared the
results to other available studies on CRISPRs (15,20). The
data were generally in good agreement, the diﬀerences
being always in the DR boundaries’ identiﬁcation
(more accurate with CRISPRFinder) or in the number
of motifs found, as the truncated DR is sometimes
neglected or short clusters are not detected with other
programs. Interestingly, some strains were claimed to
be devoid of CRISPRs by Godde and colleagues but
proved to have short CRISPRs with CRISPRFinder, such
as in diﬀerent Shigella sp. (S. sonnei Ss046, S. ﬂexneri
2a str. 301, S. ﬂexneri 2a str), or even long CRISPRs such
as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. The latter
example is shown on the CRISPRﬁnder website
(sample2), and as can be seen by using the BLAST
spacer function, six spacers out of thirty six at two
diﬀerent CRISPR loci, correspond to a bacteriophage
sequence (bacteriophages F116, B3, D3112, DMS3
and phi CTX).
The tools developed here will assist in future CRISPRs’
analysis. Furthermore, the possibility to identify
CRISPRs containing one or two motifs may help under-
stand how new CRISPRs are created. The very small
candidates will need to be typed across diﬀerent isolates
within the same species or very closely related species to
search for variations. For instance, as shown with the
sample ﬁle provided on the website (YP1 Yersinia),
ﬁve Yersinia pestis strains possess at the same CRISPR
locus two to eight spacers, some being unique and others
shared by two or more strains (10). This strain-dependent
polymorphism is especially interesting for epidemiological
and phylogenetic studies (30,31). A tool to easily create a
dictionary of spacers from diﬀerent strains is proposed
in a CRISPR-dedicated web database (http://crispr.
u-psud.fr/crispr/).
The CRISPRFinder web server is an interface to extract
with precision and to further analyse CRISPRs from
genomic sequences. Four main advantages may be cited:
(i) short CRISPR-like structures are detected, they are
labelled questionable but may be of great interest if later
conﬁrmed; (ii) DRs are accurately deﬁned to single
base pair resolution; (iii) summary ﬁles may be uploaded
(CRISPR properties summary and spacers ﬁle in Fasta
format) and (iv) ﬂanking sequences or spacers can be
easily extracted and blasted against diﬀerent databases.
