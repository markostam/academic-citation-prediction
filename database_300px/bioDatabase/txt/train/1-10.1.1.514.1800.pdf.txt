ABSTRACT. Beginning in 1995, the size of yearling lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) stocked into the
upper Great Lakes was increased based on the assumption that these fish would be healthier and survive
better since natural mortality is thought to be inversely proportional to body size. We compared the post-
release, relative survival of paired stockings of lake trout reared to 44 fish/kg (standard size) with larger
fish reared to 22–26 fish/kg (enhanced size) in Lake Michigan. About 60,000 lake trout each of the stan-
dard and enhanced sizes for the 1994–1997 year classes were released as yearlings in spring near Clay
Banks Reef, Wisconsin, and identified with coded-wire tags and an adipose fin-clip. Recaptures were
made from 1997 to 2003 in four gill net surveys conducted in spring and fall near the release location.
Comparisons of catch-per-unit of effort corrected for numbers stocked generally indicated no significant
differences in relative survival of standard and enhanced lake trout. An autopsy-based assessment of
overall fish health and condition indicated few measures where significantly different between standard
and enhanced lake trout prior to stocking. Size differences between standard and enhanced fish remained
statistically significant at all observed ages at recapture; however growth rates were the same for the two
groups. Stocking numbers at certain sites on Lake Michigan were reduced concurrent with the change to
larger yearlings with the expectation of increased survival, which did not occur; hence recruitment was
essentially reduced in these areas for the restoration program.

INTRODUCTION
Maximizing the survival of stocked fish and the
efficiency of hatchery facilities has been the focus
of many studies in fisheries management. This has
been the case as well for the lake trout (Salvelinus
namaycush) restoration program in the Great Lakes.
Post-release survival has been measured for a wide
variety of variables that include stocking season
(Buettner 1961, Pycha and King 1967, Elrod et al.
1988), size at stocking (Pycha and King 1967),
strain stocked (Eshenroder et al. 1995, Elrod et al.
1995), method of rearing (Elrod et al. 1989), and
method of stocking (Elrod et al. 1993, Elrod 1997).
The centerpiece of the restoration program is the
annual stocking of various strains developed from
donor stocks (Krueger et al. 1983, Krueger and
Ihssen 1995) that originated from the Great Lakes
and adjacent waters. When stocking began in the
early 1960s, a target size of about 44 fish/kg was
Survival of Lake Trout in Lake Michigan 387
adopted as the size standard (hereafter referred as
“standard”) for rearing yearling fish (14–16 months
old) in federal and state hatcheries serving the
upper Great Lakes. This was based on a comparison
of the relative survival of fish reared at this and
smaller sizes that were stocked and recovered in
Lake Superior during the 1960s (Pycha and King
1967). At that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice’s Pendill’s Creek National Fish Hatchery
(Brimley, Michigan) was the primary source of lake
trout for the upper Great Lakes. Rearing conditions
there could not produce yearlings larger than 44
fish/kg because of cold water temperatures during
most of the year (annual average 6.9°C; range
0–21°C). In the 1960s and 1980s, construction of
the Jordan River (Elmira, Michigan) and Iron River
(Iron River, Wisconsin) National Fish Hatcheries,
which had warmer, more thermally stable water, al-
lowed for larger fish to be reared. Growing condi-
tions were so much better at these hatcheries that
fish were fed smaller rations or went unfed for long
periods in spring before stocking to meet the stan-
dard size and not exceed the holding capacity of the
raceways.
Beginning in 1995, the size of yearling lake trout
stocked into the upper Great Lakes by the national
fish hatcheries was increased to 22–26 fish/kg
(hereafter referred to as “enhanced”). This change
was based on the assumption that enhanced fish
would be healthier, and survive better after stocking
since natural mortality is generally thought to be in-
versely proportional to body size (see Lorenzen
2000). Further justification for enhanced lake trout
was based on observed decreases in survival of
standard lake trout stocked in other Great Lakes
(Elrod et al.1993, Hansen et al. 1994, Cornelius et
al. 1995), even though these declines were gener-
ally unrelated to size at stocking. Concerns about
the health and quality of lake trout within national
fish hatcheries also led to the change in size at
stocking. Restoration needs for the upper Great
Lakes demanded large numbers of fish from hatch-
eries that operated at maximum capacity. To meet
this demand, rearing conditions often resulted in
fish with low body fat, missing fins and eyes, and
other manifestations of over-crowding. Regardless
of these problems, stocking the standard fish re-
sulted in rebuilding populations of lake trout that
supported fisheries in all the Great Lakes (Cor-
nelius et al. 1995, Elrod et al. 1995, Eshenroder et
al. 1995, Holey et al. 1995) and lead to the restora-
tion of lake trout populations in Lake Superior
(Hansen et al. 1995, Bronte et al. 2003). 
Rearing capacity of hatcheries is related to stand-
ing fish weight as opposed to numbers of fish,
therefore any increases in fish size would result in
less fish produced. It was assumed that increases in
post-release survival of enhanced fish would offset
decreases in the numbers of fish stocked. In 1994,
the Lake Michigan Committee of the Great Lakes
Fishery Commission approved the move to en-
hanced fish, and a plan to measure changes in sur-
vival (Lake Michigan Committee 1995). To
measure the survival response, equal groups of
standard and enhanced lake trout were stocked at
Clay Banks Reef near Algoma, Wisconsin during
1995–1998. The objective of this study was to de-
termine if enhanced lake trout survived better than
standard lake trout in Lake Michigan. Evidence for
increased survival would be demonstrated by sig-
nificantly higher relative abundance of the en-
hanced fish compared to the standard fish in paired
stockings of year classes measured in gill net sur-
veys in later years. Similar measures of relative
abundance between the groups would indicate that
survival was not different. 
METHODS
All lake trout used in this study were from the
1994–1997 year classes the Lewis Lake strain
reared at the Jordan River National Fish Hatchery
to avoid strain and hatchery effects when compar-
ing the post-release survival of standard and en-
hanced fish. Eggs were fertilized from broodstock
at the Saratoga National Fish Hatchery (Saratoga,
Wyoming) in October and eyed eggs transported to
Jordan River by December of each year to be reared
for 14–15 months in water temperatures from
6.1–10.5°C. The eggs were incubated in hatching
jars and hatched in late December. All fry were fed
for optimum growth and reared indoors until late
August and afterward, the fingerlings were moved
to outdoor raceways and separated by study group.
Fish were fed and held at densities to achieve the
standard and enhanced quality and sizes, with ex-
ception of the 1994 year class when the size separa-
tion between the two groups was not as large as
desired. The standard group was fed to achieve a
growth rate that did not exceed 7.6 mm per month,
and reach 49.6/kg at stocking. The enhanced group
was fed to achieve growth of 10.1–15.2 mm per
month and a size of 22.0–26.5/kg. Each group and
year class received a unique coded-wire tag number
and an adipose fin-clip to allow identification at re-
capture.

Survival of Lake Trout in Lake Michigan 389
We used an autopsy-based assessment of overall
fish health and condition (Goede and Barton 1990,
hereafter referred to as Goede’s assessment) to
quantify health and condition differences between
standard and enhanced fish. This assessment in-
volves a gross visual examination and ranking of
the appearance and condition of external (eyes, gills
including the opercle and pseudobranch, and fins)
and internal (thymus, fat around pyloric ceca,
color/condition of spleen, hindgut, kidney, liver,
and bile) tissues and organs. Measures of length,
weight, and condition are also collected. Rank clas-
sifications are based on deviations from normal
conditions of the organs and tissues of healthy fish.
This assessment is conducted on fish at national
fish hatcheries during rearing and prior to stocking
(Table 1); see Goede and Barton (1990) for
specifics. To simplify our analysis, only the fre-
quencies of normal and abnormal rankings were
used as opposed to the analysis of degrees of abnor-
mality indicated in the published procedure. We
compared the results of this assessment between the
standard and enhanced lots to determine if and
where significant differences existed in the
health/condition that may explain any observed dif-
ferences in post-release survival. We used two-sam-
ple t-tests for continuous data and chi-square tests
for categorical data to test for significant difference
between standard and enhanced fish. Statistical sig-
nificance was assumed at α ≤ 0.05.
About 60,000 fish of each treatment (standard
and enhanced) of the 1994–1997 year classes were
stocked into Lake Michigan near Clay Banks Reef
between Sturgeon Bay and Algoma, Wisconsin in
spring 1995–1998 when the fish where 14–15
months old (Table 2). Comparisons of the relative

abundance of the treatment groups for each year
class were made from recoveries of the coded-wire
tagged fish in four gill net-surveys conducted
within 80 km of the stocking site by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service during 1997–2003. Eighty-
two km is the approximate dispersion radius for
most adult lake trout in that area (Schmalz et al.
2002) and 60 km for yearling fish recaptured as
adults (Lake Michigan Lake Trout Task Group,
Great Lakes Fishery Commission; unpublished
data). The four surveys were as follows: 1) a juve-
nile lake trout survey in spring that f ished
1,900–6,000 m gangs of 51 mm stretch-measure
mesh gill nets near Clay Banks, 2) a juvenile lake
whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) survey in
spring that fished mostly 732 m gangs of 51-, 64-,
76-, and 89-mm stretch-measure mesh gill nets
near Bailey’s Harbor, WI, 3) a lakewide lake trout
and burbot (Lota lota) survey in spring (Schnee-
berger et al. 1997) that fished 488 m gangs of
64–152 mm stretch-measure mesh gill nets by 25-
mm increments near Sturgeon Bay, and 4) a spawn-
ing lake trout survey in fall that fished 244 m
gangs of 114-, 127-, 140-, and 152-mm stretch-
measure mesh gill nets at Clay Banks (Table 2).
All nets were lifted after one night, weather per-
mitting, and all coded wire tagged fish were sacri-
ficed, and their snouts removed and frozen. At the
lab, coded wire tags were extracted and decoded to
determine year class and treatment affiliation.
Relative abundance (CPE) of fish caught from
each treatment and year class was expressed as the
average number caught per 305 m of net in each lift
adjusted for the number of fish stocked to provide
an index of survival where
enhanced fish. Statistical significance was assumed
at α ≤ 0.05. 
We determined if growth differed between stan-
dard and enhanced fish after stocking. We com-
pared estimates and asymptotic standard errors of
Loo, (asymptotic length) and K (Brody growth coef-
ficient) of the Von Bertalanffy growth equation fit
to individual observed lengths at ages 2–7 for each
group by combining all  observations during
1997–2003. We used a non-linear least squares pro-
cedure with biologically reasonable seed values to
estimate model coefficients. Similar estimates of K
would indicate no growth difference between the
groups (Francis 1996). We also compared lengths-
at-age between standard and enhanced fish with
ANOVA with length as the dependent variable to
determine if length differences at stocking where
maintained throughout life. 
RESULTS
Few measures in the Goede’s assessment were
significantly different between standard and en-
hanced lake trout prior to stocking into Lake Michi-
gan. As expected, enhanced fish where significantly
(P < 0.0001) longer and heavier than standard fish,
and had a slightly higher condition factor (P <
0.0001) (Table 1). Blood glucose levels were signif-
icantly (P < 0.0001) higher in enhanced fish as
were the incidence of normal gills (P = 0.006), nor-
mal (non-eroded) right pectoral fins (P < 0.0001),
and the amount of mesenteric fat (P < 0.0001).
We made 95 gill-net lifts that captured 769 lake
trout that were from the paired stockings of stan-
dard and enhanced fish (Table 2). Of these, 378 fish
were standard fish and 391 were enhanced fish.
Comparisons of CPEs, corrected for numbers
stocked, generally indicated no significant differ-
ences (all P = 0.11–1.00) in relative survival of
standard and enhanced lake trout across all surveys,
within individual surveys, or for year classes within
a survey (Table 3). The exceptions were for the
1996 year class in the juvenile lake trout survey (P
= 0.04), the 1995 year class in the lake trout spawn-
ing survey (P = 0.02), and all years aggregated in
the lake trout spawning survey (P = 0.02). Results
for these comparisons were contrary to expecta-
tions; CPE of standard fish was significantly higher
than that of the enhanced fish. Distributions of CPE
across lifts, indicated by standard deviations of the
adjusted means, were similar and of the same mag-
nitude for both standard and enhanced fish for most
year classes in all the surveys. 
C is the number of fish caught for year class j and
gill net-lift i, f is the gill net-effort standardized to
305 m, S is the number stocked at age 1 for year
class j and n is the number of gill net lifts. Relative
abundance data were pooled across sample years
for each treatment and compared for each survey
because catches and number of lifts within a year
and survey were low (Table 2). Treatment effects
were also tested on CPEs pooled across year
classes, years, and surveys. Because CPE data are
not normally distributed, we used the non-paramet-
ric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to investigate dif-
ferences between the CPE of the standard and

Survival of Lake Trout in Lake Michigan 391
Growth rates were similar for both standard and
enhanced fish as indicated by identical estimates of
K (Table 4) and similar standard errors. Observed
length-at-age, which was higher for enhanced fish
at stocking (Table 2), remained significantly higher
than standard fish at ages 2–7 years (F = 1385.9; 
df = 6, 635; P < 0.00001) (Fig.1). The calculated
asymptotic length (Loo,) of the enhanced fish was
higher than for standard fish.
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that there was no significant
difference in post-release survival of enhanced lake
trout compared to standard lake trout at Clay Banks
in Lake Michigan even though some measures of
health and condition were significantly better for
enhanced fish. The change to stocking enhanced
fish in 1995 resulted in about 12% less total fish
stocked and up to 40% less at a given stocking site
compared to levels during 1985–1994, and led to a
decrease in lake trout recruitment that was not off-
set by the anticipated increased survival. A substan-
tial increase in survival of enhanced fish would be
required to result in a significant increase in overall
recruitment.

These results represent survival results for only
the Lewis Lake strain raised at Jordan River Na-
tional Fish Hatchery and stocked in Lake Michigan.
The lake trout restoration program utilizes many
more strains from three separate production facili-
ties and the outcome from stocking enhanced fish
from these sources may not be similar. A similar,
but more extensive study in Lake Huron of the per-
formance of fish from the same strain, sizes, and
production lots, indicated better post-release sur-
vival of the enhanced fish. However, the results
varied by stocking location, year class, and year
sampled (Aaron Woldt, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice, 145 Water Street, Alpena, Michigan 49707,
personal communication). Regardless, stocking en-
hance lake trout has been partially credited for in-
creases in post-release survival in Lake Huron
(Johnson et al. 2004). This may indicate a site ef-
fect not considered in the Lake Michigan experi-
ment but given the inconsistent results from Lake
Huron, and no significant differences reported here,
suggests that any survival advantage of enhanced
fish may be modest at best. 
More extensive movement of the enhanced fish
out of the study area could explain the lack of con-
trast in relative survival measured here but is un-
likely. Recaptures of the experimental fish in a
lake-wide, multi-agency survey of lake trout in
Lake Michigan (Schneeburger et al. 1997) indicated
that 11% of the standard fish and 12% of the en-
hanced fish were recaptured outside our primary
study area and most where taken off Sheboygan,
Wisconsin, about 100 km from the release location.
This finding suggests that differential movements
of the study groups did not influence our relative
survival measures. 
These results have led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to reevaluate production and stocking tar-
gets in order to produce the most fish possible in
their existing hatcheries. Current lake trout restora-
tion plans for Lakes Huron (Ebener 1998) and
Michigan (Lake Michigan Lake Trout Technical
Committee 1985) call for a total of 10.6 million
yearling lake trout to be stocked annually in U.S
waters. Since capacities at national fish hatcheries
cannot meet this demand, modified stocking targets
have been adopted for both lakes that total 3.3 mil-
lion fish annually for U.S. waters. In an attempt to
address the production short comings, the national
fish hatcheries have identified priority maintenance
and construction projects necessary to improve ex-
isting capabilities and increase propagation. These
projects include installation of liquid oxygen, up-
grading surface water intakes, enclosing and re-
placing existing raceways,  and adding new
raceways. These improvements could increase pro-
duction from about 3.6 million fish currently to 5.1
million fish without the construction of a new
hatchery.
Future criteria for lake trout reared and stocked
by national fish hatcheries will focus on fish quality
rather than size (number/kg). Most Goedes mea-
sures were similar across standard and enhanced
fish, and since relative survival did not differ be-
tween the groups, size was not relevant. Rearing
lower densities of higher quality fish will also re-
duce stress and lower the chances of a disease epi-
zootic. Since rearing environments are unique
enough at each lake trout hatchery, fish-quality tar-
gets for characteristics such as visceral fat, and
eyes, gills, and fin condition are being developed
for each facility. These changes should increase the
rearing capacity to help ensure the best post-release
survival of lake trout stocked for restoration.
Changes in size at stocking should be pursued
with caution. The decision to produce larger fish
was made prior to the results of this study and the
outcome showed no benefit to the lake trout restora-
tion program in Lake Michigan. While stocking
larger fish does appear to increase survival for

many species (i.e., Dudash and Heidinger 1996,
Szendrey and Wahl 1996), the case for lake trout is
less clear. Most survival comparisons for lake trout
in the Great Lakes have been between two life
stages and clearly demonstrated that yearlings sur-
vived 2.4–9 times greater than much smaller fall
fingerlings (Buettner 1961, Pycha and King 1967,
Elrod et al. 1988). These comparisons, which likely
influenced the decision to stock the enhanced fish,
are not relevant here. Time of year, age at stocking,
and larger differences at size at stocking are all po-
tential effects that influenced survival, and those re-
sults are not directly transferable to the experiment
described here.
