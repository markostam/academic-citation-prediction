ABSTRACT
Most human diseases are complex multi-factorial
diseases resulting from the combination of various
genetic and environmental factors. In the KEGG
database resource (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/),
diseases are viewed as perturbed states of the
molecular system, and drugs as perturbants to the
molecular system. Disease information is com-
puterized in two forms: pathway maps and gene/
molecule lists. The KEGG PATHWAY database
contains pathway maps for the molecular systems
in both normal and perturbed states. In the KEGG
DISEASE database, each disease is represented by
a list of known disease genes, any known environ-
mental factors at the molecular level, diagnostic
markers and therapeutic drugs, which may reflect
the underlying molecular system. The KEGG DRUG
database contains chemical structures and/or
chemical components of all drugs in Japan,
including crude drugs and TCM (Traditional
Chinese Medicine) formulas, and drugs in the USA
and Europe. This database also captures knowledge
about two types of molecular networks: the interac-
tion network with target molecules, metabolizing
enzymes, other drugs, etc. and the chemical struc-
ture transformation network in the history of drug
development. The new disease/drug information
resource named KEGG MEDICUS can be used as
a reference knowledge base for computational
analysis of molecular networks, especially, by
integrating large-scale experimental datasets.
INTRODUCTION
Twenty years ago, the Human Genome Project was
initiated aiming to uncover the genetic factors of human
diseases and to develop new strategies for diagnosis, treat-
ment and prevention. The successful sequencing of the
human genome and the following coordinated eﬀorts,
such as the HapMap project (1), genome-wide association
studies (2) and the cancer genome projects (3), have
resulted in the discovery of many disease-associated
genes. However, our understanding of molecular mecha-
nisms is still largely incomplete for the majority of diseases,
which are multi-factorial diseases resulting from the com-
bination of various genetic and environmental factors.
There must be inherent relationships among these factors
for the etiology and pathogenesis, and they may be
characterized by considering the molecular networks
involving these factors. The analysis of network–disease
associations, in addition to gene–disease associations,
would better clarify the molecular mechanisms of
diseases and help develop new drugs and treatments.
The KEGG database project was initiated in 1995, orig-
inally as part of the Japanese Human Genome Program
(4). Since then we have been organizing our knowledge of
cellular functions and organism behaviors in computable
forms, especially in the forms of molecular networks
(KEGG pathway maps) and hierarchical lists (BRITE
functional hierarchies). This computerized knowledge
has been widely used as a reference for biological inter-
pretation of large-scale datasets generated by sequencing
and other high-throughput experimental technologies.
Our eﬀorts are now focused on human diseases and
drugs. We consider diseases as perturbed states of
the molecular system that operates the cell and the
organism, and drugs as perturbants to the molecular
system. There are a number of disease databases available
(5), but they are mostly descriptive databases for humans
to read and understand. In KEGG, disease information is
being organized in more computable forms: pathway
maps and gene/molecule lists. Here, we summarize
the current status of the KEGG project and the new
developments of the KEGG DISEASE and KEGG
DRUG databases that comprise KEGG MEDICUS.

OVERVIEW OF KEGG
Molecular building blocks
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is
an integrated database resource consisting of 16 main
databases, broadly categorized into systems information,
genomic information and chemical information as shown
in Table 1. Genomic and chemical information represents
the molecular building blocks of life in the genomic and
chemical spaces, respectively, and systems information
represents functional aspects of the biological systems,
such as the cell and the organism, that are built from
the building blocks. The actual data contents of the
genomic information category are: gene catalogs
(KEGG GENES) in the completely sequenced genomes
(KEGG GENOME), computationally derived sequence
similarity relationships (KEGG SSDB), manually
deﬁned ortholog groups (KEGG ORTHOLOGY) and
supplementary gene catalog data (KEGG DGENES and
EGENES). The data contents of the chemical information
category are: small molecules (KEGG COMPOUND),
glycans (KEGG GLYCAN), reactions among them
(KEGG REACTION), chemical structure transformation
patterns derived from them (KEGG RPAIR) and supple-
mentary information on enzyme nomenclature (KEGG
ENZYME). The ﬁve databases in the chemical informa-
tion category are collectively called KEGG LIGAND.
Note that KEGG DRUG has been moved from the
chemical information category (6) to the systems informa-
tion category to integrate with KEGG DISEASE.
Molecular systems
The systems information category is the most unique
feature in the KEGG resource. Data and knowledge
about the molecular systems that govern cellular pro-
cesses and organism behaviors are manually collected
and summarized from literature and presented in
computable forms, called ‘pathway map’ (graph), ‘simple
list’ (membership) and ‘hierarchical list’ (ontology),
as illustrated in Figure 1. The pathway map in KEGG
PATHWAY represents our knowledge about various
types of molecular networks: reaction/interaction
networks for metabolism, genetic information processing,
environmental information processing and other cellular
processes; perturbed reaction/interaction networks
for human diseases; and relation networks (chemical
structure transformation networks) for drug development.
The molecular network shown in the pathway map is a
graph consisting of nodes (orthologs, genes, proteins,
small molecules, etc.) and edges (reactions, interactions
and relations). In contrast, the simple list is a set of
nodes without the wiring information, simply representing
the membership to a molecular system. This representa-
tion is used when the detail of the molecular system is not
known (KEGG DISEASE) or when a tighter functional
unit is indicated within the molecular network (KEGG
MODULE). The hierarchical list in KEGG BRITE
represents hierarchically organized membership informa-
tion, which may be called ontology. It is used to represent
our knowledge on functional hierarchies inherent in
various types of biological systems; not only molecular
systems, but also cellular and organismal systems. The
content of KEGG BRITE is currently classiﬁed into:
genes and proteins; compounds and reactions; drugs and
diseases; and cells and organisms.
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN KEGG
KEGG GENES and ortholog annotation
One of the main objectives of the KEGG project has been
to uncover higher level systemic functions of the cell
and the organism from genomic and molecular-level infor-
mation. The basis for genome annotation in KEGG,
which is continuously performed for all sequenced
genomes, is the KO system consisting of manually
deﬁned ortholog groups that correspond to individual
nodes in the KEGG pathway maps and the BRITE func-
tional hierarchies. Once genes are assigned KO identiﬁers
or K numbers by the ortholog annotation procedure
described below, the collective body of K numbers can
be mapped to KEGG pathway maps and BRITE func-
tional hierarchies, highlighting any subsystems present
and enabling higher level functional interpretation of the
genome.
During the past two years, the ortholog annotation
procedure has been signiﬁcantly improved by the newly
developed KOALA (KEGG Orthology and Links
Annotation) tool. There are two types of annotation in
KEGG. One is a genome-based annotation, assigning
K numbers to genes in a given genome. The other is
a KO-based annotation, assigning a given K number
(such as in a pathway map) to genes in all organisms.
In order to cope with an increasing number of com-
plete genomes, the ﬁrst annotation is now partially
automated (except for selected reference organisms)
with continuous eﬀorts to manually improve the second

cross-species annotation. The current KEGG annotation
procedure is as follows.
(1) Gene information for completely sequenced genomes
is computationally generated from RefSeq (7) and
other public resources, and stored in the KEGG
GENES database.
(2) Sequence similarity scores and best-hit relations are
computationally generated from KEGG GENES by
pair-wise genome comparisons using SSEARCH, and
stored in the KEGG SSDB database.
(3) Automatic genome-based annotation is performed
for a limited set (currently, about one-third) of K
numbers, which are considered safe for such
purpose based on the result of SSDB computation
and the criteria of the KOALA tool.
(4) Manual annotation is performed across species for
other K numbers using the KOALA and GFIT (8)
tools. This step may involve addition/revision of
ortholog groups, which is essential to increase the
number of safe K numbers.
A glimpse of this procedure can be seen through the
read-only versions of KOALA and GFIT tools available
on the KO and GENES entry pages, respectively.
The quality of KEGG ortholog annotation can be
examined by two additional tools. The ortholog table
tool displays the status of KO assignment for a given set
of K numbers, which is useful to check the completeness of
a pathway or a complex. The gene cluster tool displays the
status of KO assignment along the chromosomal position
of a given genome, which is useful to check the consistency
of annotation for operon-like structures in bacterial
genomes.
As of 3 September 2009, the KEGG GENES database
contains 4.8million genes in 1049 genomes. In compari-
son, the UniProt database (9) contains 9.4million
proteins from one-half million species. KEGG already
covers half of the known protein universe and >90%
of protein sequence families (Kanehisa,M., unpublished
data). As the number of complete genomes increases, the
coverage of the protein universe will also increase, but
there will be remaining fractions of protein families, such
as for plant proteins and viral proteins. These protein
families are useful to analyze, for example, EST data
and metagenomics data, and they will be incorporated
in the KO system.

KEGG PATHWAY and BRITE: reference
knowledge bases
The KEGG reference pathway maps and BRITE reference
hierarchies are created in a general way to be applicable
to all organisms; namely, in terms of the orthologs deﬁned
by K numbers. The organism-speciﬁc pathways and
hierarchies can then be generated by converting K
numbers to gene identiﬁers in a given organism. In the
past year, the KEGG PATHWAY database has been
completely renovated. All the pathway maps have been
redrawn using a newly developed tool called KegSketch,
which generates KGML+ (meaning KGML+SVG)
ﬁles. Internally the database update procedure is now
based on the text manipulation of these ﬁles rather than
the color manipulation of image ﬁles. For outside services,
the coloring procedure continues to be done on image
ﬁles, but the image ﬁle format has been changed from
GIF to PNG to accommodate more colors. As a result,
there is now no distinction between the global map (6) and
the regular pathway maps; they can be manipulated in the
same way both in the new KEGG Atlas tool and the tra-
ditional image map viewer. Another new feature in the
outside service is the XML version of KEGG pathway
maps, which is made available in both the original
KGML format and the converted BioPAX level
2 format (10).
KEGG LIGAND for chemical bioinformatics
The KEGG LIGAND database contains information
about chemical structures and chemical reactions of endo-
genous molecules, small molecules to larger biopolymers.
Certain KEGG pathway maps contain reference chemical
structures that can be used to link genomes to the
chemical diversity of endogenous molecules. For
example, the KEGG pathway map for N-glycan biosyn-
thesis (map00510) contains both the biosynthetic pathway
and the synthesized glycan structure. By mapping the
genomic content of glycosyltransferases, such as for
human (hsa00510), the organism-speciﬁc pathway and
the organism-speciﬁc glycan structure can be seen. This
type of structural mapping has been done more extensively
in eukaryotic genomes to characterize the chemical struc-
tural diversity of glycans (11) and lipids (12). A potentially
more interesting, but more diﬃcult, problem is to link
plant genomes to plant secondary metabolites. Plants
are known to produce diverse chemical compounds
including those with medicinal and nutritional values,
but the chemical architecture is more complex than
simple biopolymers of glycans and lipids. We have
introduced KEGG PLANT, a new interface to the
KEGG resource for plant research, especially for under-
standing relationships between genomic and chemical
information of plant natural products.
We have also been trying to expand our knowledge
on biochemical reactions from experimentally charac-
terized reactions in Enzyme Nomenclature (KEGG
ENZYME) to pathway-based deﬁnition of reactions
(KEGG REACTION) to chemical structural motifs,
called RDM patterns that characterize reactions (KEGG
RPAIR). The RDM patterns have been used to predict
microbial biodegradation pathways from chemical
structures of environmental compounds (13). As an exten-
sion of this line of research, the E-zyme tool for reaction
prediction from a pair (or pairs) of chemical structures has
been upgraded by introducing a new algorithm (14).
KEGG MEDICUS for analysis of network–disease
associations
In KEGG, disease and drug information is being organized
in more computable forms, especially for the analysis of
molecular networks. As shown in Table 2, the disease/drug
resource, called KEGG MEDICUS, consists of each of
the KEGG DISEASE and KEGG DRUG databases, a
speciﬁc category of the KEGG PATHWAY database
and a speciﬁc category of the KEGG BRITE database.
Disease information is computerized in two forms:
pathway maps and gene/molecule lists. The Human
Diseases category of the KEGG PATHWAY database
contains about 40 pathway maps for cancers, immune
disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, circulatory
diseases, metabolic disorders and infectious diseases.
When the detail of the molecular network is not known
but disease genes are identiﬁed, we use the gene/molecule
list representation and create a KEGG DISEASE entry.
The entry contains a list of known disease genes and
other relevant molecules including environmental factors,
diagnostic markers and therapeutic drugs. The list simply
deﬁnes the membership to the underlying molecular
system, but is still useful for computational analysis.
The KEGG DRUG database is a chemical structure-
based information resource for all prescription and OTC
drugs in Japan including crude drugs and TCM formulas,
as well as most prescription drugs in the USA and many
prescription drugs from Europe. In addition to chemical
structures (or chemical compositions for multi-component
drugs) and therapeutic eﬃcacy of about 9000 drugs
(as of September 2009), diﬀerent drug classiﬁcation
systems are maintained as part of the KEGG BRITE
functional hierarchies. Some are based on the established
classiﬁcation systems to which KEGG DRUG entries are
assigned, including the ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical) classiﬁcation by WHO, therapeutic category
of prescription drugs in Japan and classiﬁcation of OTC
drugs in Japan. There are additional classiﬁcation systems
developed by KEGG, including those for crude drugs and
TCM formulas.
Furthermore, KEGG DRUG contains information
about two types of molecular networks. The ﬁrst
network is a molecular interaction network representing
interactions and/or relations with target molecules (often
in the context of pathway maps), drug metabolizing
enzymes, drug transporters and other drugs (especially
those causing adverse eﬀects). The second network is a
network of chemical structure changes in small molecules,
which includes series of chemical modiﬁcations introduced
by medicinal chemists in the history of drug development
(in the KEGG drug structure maps), secondary metabolic
pathways for biosynthesis of druggable natural products
and drug metabolism (both in the KEGG pathway maps).
We have analyzed the chemical architecture of marketed
D358 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, Database issue
drugs and the patterns of chemical structure transfor-
mations in the history of drug development (15), in a
similar spirit to the RDM patterns of chemical structure
transformations in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. As
illustrated in Figure 2, the second network may be used
to analyze the chemical architecture of natural products
and the chemical architecture of marketed drugs towards
drug discovery from the genomes of plants and micro-
organisms. Furthermore, the second network may have
relevance in understanding drug metabolism and
biodegradation of environmental substances by consider-
ing not only the human genome but also the metagenome
of the human body.
ACCESSING KEGG
Web sites
KEGG is made available at both the GenomeNet web site
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and the KEGG website
(http://www.kegg.jp/). The KEGG Atlas tool is available
only at the KEGG web site.
KEGG identiﬁers
Each database entry in KEGG is identiﬁed by the form of
‘db:entry’ where ‘db’ is the database name and ‘entry’ is
the entry identiﬁer. With the new version of the DBGET
database retrieval system (16) the db preﬁx is no longer
necessary, because the entry identiﬁers are unique across
all the KEGG databases. For example, C00022 is suﬃ-
cient rather than cpd:C00022. See more details at the
KEGG identiﬁers page (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/
kegg3.html). This simple form can be used to retrieve
individual database entries, pathway maps and BRITE
hierarchies by the REST-based URLs (http://www
.genome.jp/kegg/docs/weblink.html) at the KEGG
web site.
