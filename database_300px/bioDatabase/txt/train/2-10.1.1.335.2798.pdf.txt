Abstract
The response of eukaryotic cells to DNA damage includes the
activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–related kinases
(PIKK), such as ATM, ATR, and DNA-dependent protein kinase
(DNA-PK). These three kinases have very similar substrate
specificities in vitro , but in vivo , their substrates overlap only
partially. Several in vivo substrates of ATM and ATR have been
identified and almost all of them are involved in DNA damage–
induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. In contrast, few
in vivo substrates of DNA-PK have been identified. These
include histone H2AX and DNA-PK itself. We identify here
valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a novel substrate of DNA-
PK and other PIKK family members. VCP is phosphorylated at
Ser784 within its COOH terminus, a region previously shown to
target VCP to specific intracellular compartments. Further-
more, VCP phosphorylated at Ser784 accumulated at sites of
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). VCP is a protein chaperone
that unfolds and translocates proteins. Its phosphorylation in
response to DNA damage and its recruitment to sites of DNA
DSBs could indicate a role of VCP in DNA repair. (Cancer Res
2005; 65(17): 7533-40)
Introduction
The DNA damage checkpoint is an evolutionarily conserved
signaling pathway that in response to DNA damage triggers cell
cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (1). The key transducers of the DNA
damage signal are the protein kinases ATM and ATR, which are
activated primarily by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and
replication blocks, respectively (2, 3). ATM and ATR are members
of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–related kinase (PIKK) family
and phosphorylate serine or threonine residues that are followed
by a glutamine (4). As such, ATM and ATR are often referred to as
S/T-Q-directed kinases. Several in vivo substrates of ATM and ATR
have been identified, including Chk2, Chk1, p53, SMC1, histone
H2AX, NBS1, BRCA1, and FANCD2 (1–4). Most of these proteins are
phosphorylated by ATM and ATR at multiple sites that typically
cluster near each other. For example, Chk2 has 7 S/T-Q sites within
its NH2 terminus. Of these seven sites, Thr
68 is the predominant
site phosphorylated by ATM, whereas other sites, such as Ser33, are
phosphorylated by ATM only when cells are exposed to high doses
of ionizing radiation (5, 6).
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a third member of
the PIKK family (4). Unlike ATM and ATR, inactivation of DNA-PK
does not lead to major cell cycle checkpoint defects but instead
compromises nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)–mediated repair
of DNA DSBs (7). DNA-PK phosphorylates many proteins in vitro ,
but few in vivo substrates have been identified. These include
histone H2AX, the Werner syndrome helicase, Artemis, XRCC4, and
DNA-PK itself (8–11). DNA-PK autophosphorylation, especially at
Thr2609, is important for DNA-PK to stimulate NHEJ (7, 8).
A protein recently proposed to play a role in repair of DNA
damage is valosin-containing protein (VCP), a 97-kDa homologue of
yeast Cdc48p (12–14). VCP is a ubiquitous and highly abundant
ATPase that belongs to the AAA (ATPase associated with a variety of
cellular activities) family and assembles as a hexamer forming a ring
with a channel at its center (15–17). The VCP homohexamers
associate with a number of protein cofactors forming distinct
macromolecular complexes, which act as chaperones unfolding
target proteins and translocating them to specific cellular compart-
ments or to the proteasome (13). Because VCP can participate in
several macromolecular complexes and can act as a chaperone of
many proteins, it is involved in many unrelated cellular activities,
such as membrane fusion, cell cycle regulation, stress response,
programmed cell death, B- and T-cell activation, transcriptional
regulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–associated degradation, and
protein degradation (13). VCP has also been proposed to play a role
in the DNA damage response, because it can associate with the
Werner syndrome protein, a member of the RecQ helicase family
(18, 19), as well as with BRCA1 (20). However, its precise role in the
response of cells to DNA damage is still obscure.
In an effort to identify novel proteins that become phosphor-
ylated at S/T-Q motifs in response to DNA damage, we isolated
proteins that cross-react with an antibody raised against a
synthetic Chk2 peptide, in which Thr26 and Ser28 of Chk2 were
phosphorylated. Surprisingly, the predominant protein recognized
by this antibody in cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents was
VCP. We mapped the site of VCP phosphorylation at Ser784 and
showed that VCP was phosphorylated by multiple PIKK family
members. These results suggest that VCP is a direct target of DNA
damage signaling pathways in mammalian cells.

hemocyanin–coupled Chk2 phosphopeptide of the sequence QPHGSV-
tQsQGSS, where t and s mark the phosphorylated threonine and serine,
respectively. Immunoglobulins from the immunized rabbits were precipi-
tated by Protein A-Sepharose; phospho-Chk2-reactive antibodies were then
affinity purified first by removing antibodies that recognize nonphosphory-
lated Chk2 and then by selecting for antibodies that recognize phosphor-
ylated Chk2 using columns carrying immobilized nonphosphorylated and
phosphorylated Chk2 peptides, respectively. The specificity of the affinity-
purified antibodies was confirmed using extracts prepared from untreated
and DNA damage–treated cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type Chk2 or
Chk2 mutated at Thr26/Ser28 (22). All other antibodies used in this study
were commercially available or were previously described: VCP monoclonal,
Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc., Portland, ME (#MAB696S); DNA-PKcs
rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom (#ab230); 53BP1
monoclonal (23); and histone H3 rabbit polyclonal, Abcam (#ab1791).
Cell lines. The following human cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA): HeLa cervical carcino-
ma, U2OS osteosarcoma, 293 embryonic kidney cells, HCT15 colon
carcinoma, M059K (wild-type DNAPK), and M059J (DNA-PK deficient)
glioblastomas. AG1522 normal human primary fibroblasts and AT5BI
primary fibroblasts from a patient with ataxia-telangiectasia have been
described previously (24).
Induction of DNA damage. DNA damage was induced by exposing cells
to ionizing radiation (137Cs source), UV light (254 nm; Stratalinker,
Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), doxorubicin (0.2 Ag/mL for 24 hours; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO; #D1515), bleomycin (20 Ag/mL for 30 minutes; Sigma, #B8416),
or hydroxyurea (1 mmol/L for 8 hours; Sigma, #H8627).
Cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting.Whole cell
protein extracts were prepared from HeLa, 293, M059K, and M059J cells by
lysis in buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.55), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1
mmol/L EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L sodium
vanadate, and a protease inhibitor cocktail for 10 minutes on ice followed
by centrifugation to remove the particulate material. To prepare chromatin-
enriched fractions and matched whole cell extracts, the cells were lysed in
buffer consisting of 100 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 240 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
NP40, 1 mmol/L DTT, and protease-kinase-phosphatase inhibitors (6, 23).
After centrifugation, the soluble material served as matched whole cell
extract, whereas the chromatin-enriched pellet was solubilized by in-
cubation in buffer consisting of 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
10 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 1.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and 0.25 N HCl for 1 hour at 4jC. After being solubilized, the
chromatin-enriched fraction was clarified by centrifugation and neutralized
by adding one-fifth volume 1.5 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). Nuclear extracts
were prepared from U2OS cells as previously described (25). Immunopre-
cipitations were done using 800 Ag whole cell extract, 0.4 Ag phospho-Chk2
(Thr26/Ser28) antibody and 50 AL Protein G-Agarose beads. For immuno-
blotting either half of the immunoprecipitated reaction or whole cell
extracts (100 Ag) or nuclear extracts (25 Ag) or chromatin-enriched
fractions (15 Ag) and matched whole cell extracts (1.5 Ag) were resolved on
SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
Mass spectrometry.Mass spectrometry (MS) was done using as starting
material 800 Ag HeLa whole cell extract immunoprecipitated with the
phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody, as described above, or 3 mg U2OS
nuclear extract immunoprecipitated with 10 Ag phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28)
antibody that had been covalently coupled to epoxy-dynabeads (Dynal
M-270 Epoxy 143.01) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The
immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels,
stained with colloidal Coomassie blue, and destained with 1% acetic acid
and 30% methanol. The bands corresponding to proteins immunoprecipi-
tated from HeLa cells were excised and cut in half; one half was subjected to

in-gel proteolytic digestion with trypsin and the other half with
chymotrypsin to maximize coverage of the protein by recovered peptides.
After quenching the digestions by lowering the pH to f2 to 3 with acetic
acid, the two portions of each band were mixed back together and analyzed
by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). The bands
corresponding to proteins immunoprecipitated from U2OS cells were
treated similarly, except that they were digested only with trypsin. Data-
dependent LC/MS/MS was done using electrospray ionization on a
Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. An aliquot of each digest
mixture was introduced to the mass spectrometer by reversed-phase
chromatographic separation with a 75-Am-inner-diameter capillary column
flowing at a rate off350 nL/min and eluted using a 60-minute acetonitrile/
0.1% acetic acid gradient. Chromatographic separation yieldedf30-second
peak widths and mass spectra were acquired in 9-second cycles. Each cycle
was of the form: one full MS scan followed by four MS/MS scans on the
most abundant precursor ions, subject to dynamic exclusion for a period of
1.5 minutes. The identity of each peptide sequenced was determined by
interpreting the MS/MS spectra using the SpectrumMill software we have
developed (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Phosphorylated
peptides were not detected in this data-dependent mode of operation. To
establish the VCP phosphorylation site Ser784, a second LC/MS/MS run was
done with the instrument operated in a multiple-reaction monitoring mode
where MS/MS of the precursor m/z values 1,120.6 and 1,160.6 were
repetitively taken throughout the acetonitrile gradient. These masses
were selected because they correspond to the unphosphorylated and
phosphorylated forms, respectively, of the chymotryptic VCP peptide
RFPSGNQGGAGPsQGSGGGTGGSVY, which contains the region of VCP
most similar to the peptide used to raise the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28)
antibody.
Valosin-containing protein cDNA cloning and plasmid construction.
Human VCP cDNA was amplified by PCR from a fetal brain library
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and subcloned in the pCMV-Tag2B vector
(Stratagene). Ser784 was mutated to alanine using the Stratagene
QuickChange mutagenesis kit.
Cell transfection and in vitro DNA-PK kinase reaction. Plasmids
expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or Ser784Ala (S784A) VCP were
transiently transfected into exponentially growing 293 cells using
Effectene (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Forty-eight hours after
transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium
supplemented with 40 Ag/mL bleomycin. Cell lysates were immunopre-
cipitated overnight with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody coupled to
agarose beads (Sigma, #A-1205). After washing, the beads were
resuspended in 150 AL whole cell lysis buffer without sodium vanadate.
Then, one third of the beads was saved as untreated control; one third
was treated with 5 AL calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP; New England
Biolabs, Beverly, MA, #M-0290L); and the other third was treated with

The sequence of the precursor peptide is shown below the LC/MS/MS spectrum (black letters ) and potential cleavage points numbered from the NH2-terminal and
COOH-terminal ends are indicated above and below the precursor peptide sequence, respectively. The slashes in the peptide sequence between the amino acids
indicate cleavage points generated during the MS/MS scans. The precursor mass is consistent with one phosphate in the peptide and the b14/y11 and b11/y14 ions
enable the conclusive assignment of Ser13 (Ser784 in the full-length sequence) as the phosphorylated residue. Several ions in the spectrum exhibit the neutral loss of
phosphoric acid characteristic of phospho-serine and threonine residues. B, the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody recognizes VCP phosphorylated at Ser784.
293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG (FL )–tagged wt or Ser784Ala (S784A) VCP and treated with bleomycin. FLAG-tagged proteins were
immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes the FLAG tag and either not treated or treated with phosphatase (PPase ) or sequentially with phosphatase and
then with DNA-PK, as indicated. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then immunoblotted (IB ) with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody (pT26S28) or with
the antibody that recognizes the FLAG tag. C, alignment of the sequence of the synthetic peptide used to generate the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody to the

CIP, washed, and then incubated with 1 AL DNA-PK (Promega, Madison,
WI, #V581A). Proteins bound to the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted, as described above.
Small interference RNA transfections. U2OS cells were transfected
with luciferase small interference RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides or siRNA
specific for 53BP1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), as previously described (25).
The sequence of the siRNA for 53BP1 was GAACGAGGAGACG-
GUAAUAdTdT.
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence was done as described
previously (25). All immunofluorescence images were processed using the
Imagevision Tools Library of IRIX (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA).
Results
The phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody recognizes
valosin-containing protein in cells with DNA damage. Immu-
noblotting of whole cell lysates from doxorubicin-treated HeLa
cells, using the phosphoChk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody, revealed at
least four proteins, whose phosphorylation was induced by DNA
damage (Fig. 1A, left). The major protein recognized by the
phosphospecific antibody had a molecular weight of 97 kDa, so it
could not be Chk2. This 97-kDa protein was the only protein
detected in lysates of doxorubicin-treated cells by sequential
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using the phospho-
Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody (Fig. 1A, middle) and practically the
only protein detected by sequential immunoprecipitation and
staining of the gel with colloidal Coomassie blue (Fig. 1A, right). To
determine its identity, a gel slice containing this protein was
treated with proteases and the generated peptides were subjected
to LC/MS/MS. The 97-kDa protein was unambiguously identified
as the p97 VCP. In addition, two very faint protein bands from the
same gel were identified as filamin (f280 kDa) and the catalytic
subunit of DNA-PK (f450 kDa; Fig. 1A, right).
The identity of VCP and DNA-PK as proteins recognized by
the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody in doxorubicin-treated
HeLa cells was further verified by sequential immunoprecipita-
tion with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody and immu-
noblotting with antibodies specific for VCP or DNA-PK (Fig. 1B).
These experiments further indicated that doxorubicin treatment
did not affect the overall protein levels of VCP and DNA-PK in
HeLa cells.
Having established that VCP is the major protein recognized by
the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody in doxorubicin-treated
HeLa cells, we subsequently examined U2OS osteosarcoma cells
exposed to ionizing radiation, hydroxyurea, or UV light. Immuno-
blotting of nuclear extracts from these cells revealed a 97-kDa
molecular weight protein that reacted with the phospho-Chk2
(Thr26/Ser28) antibody in response to DNA damage (Fig. 1C, left).
We then used this same antibody for protein immunoprecipitation
and identification of the immunoprecipitated proteins by MS. A
single protein was immunoprecipitated from extracts of U2OS cells
exposed to ionizing radiation; this protein was identified as VCP by
MS (Fig. 1C, right). From extracts of cells exposed to UV light,
several proteins were immunoprecipitated; one of these was VCP.
The remaining were cytoskeletal proteins, such as gelsolin, drebrin
E, a-actinin 4, and non–muscle myosin heavy chain type A (Fig. 1C,
right). These highly abundant cytoskeletal proteins are constitu-
tively phosphorylated and have been previously described as
contaminants in immunoprecipitations with phosphospecific anti-
bodies (26). Thus, based on the analysis of HeLa and U2OS cells
described above, we conclude that VCP is phosphorylated in
response to several DNA-damaging agents and is the predominant
protein recognized by the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody. In
support of this conclusion, immunoblotting of lysates prepared
from multiple other cell lines (HT29, COS7, 293, WI38, MCF7,
Figure 3. Multiple PIKK family members
phosphorylate VCP in vivo. A-C,
DNA-PK-deficient M059J and matched
DNA-PK-wt M059K cells were exposed to
bleomycin (Bleo , 20 Ag/mL, 30 minutes in
panel A , as indicated in panel B ) or UV
light (50 J/m2) in the presence or absence
of wortmannin (Wortm , 20 Amol/L). Extracts
from these cells were immunoblotted
(IB ) with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28)
antibody (pT26S28) or with antibodies that
recognize VCP or actin.

HCT116, MCF10A, and HCT15) with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/
Ser28) antibody revealed that the major protein phosphorylated in
response to various DNA-damaging agents (doxorubicin, bleomy-
cin, ionizing radiation, UV, and hydroxyurea) had a molecular
weight of 97 kDa (data not shown).
Valosin-containing protein is phosphorylated at Ser784 in
response to DNA damage. To establish the site of VCP
phosphorylation in response to DNA damage, VCP was immuno-
precipitated with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody from
doxorubicin-treated HeLa cells, digested with chymotrypsin,
and then analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The instrument was operated
in a multiple-reaction monitoring mode where MS/MS of the
precursor m/z values 1,120.6 and 1,160.6 were repetitively taken
throughout the acetonitrile gradient. These masses were selected
because they correspond to the unphosphorylated and phosphor-
ylated forms, respectively, of the chymotryptic peptide RFPSGNQ-
GGAGPsQGSGGGTGGSVY, which contains the region of VCP
most similar to the peptide used to raise the phospho-Chk2
(Thr26/Ser28) antibody. Interpretation of the spectra of the
precursor m/z 1,160.6 unambiguously revealed that Ser784 was
phosphorylated (Fig. 2A).
The identification of Ser784 as a residue phosphorylated in
response to DNA damage raises the possibility that the phospho-
Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody recognizes VCP phosphorylated at
Ser784. However, it is formally possible that VCP might be
phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to DNA damage, in
which case a site other than Ser784 might be recognized by the
phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody. To establish that the
phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody recognizes VCP phosphor-
ylated at Ser784, we examined whether the phospho-Chk2
(Thr26/Ser28) antibody would recognize a VCP mutant that
had Ser784 substituted with alanine (S784A). Human embryonic
kidney 293 cells were transfected with wild-type (wt) or S784A
mutant FLAG-tagged VCP, the cells were treated with the
DNA-damaging agent bleomycin and then the FLAG-tagged VCP
proteins were sequentially immunoprecipitated with an anti-
body that recognizes the FLAG tag and immunoblotted
either with the antibody that recognizes the FLAG tag or
with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody. The S784A VCP
protein was not recognized by the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28)
antibody, whereas wt VCP was recognized (Fig. 2B). Thus, the
phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody recognizes VCP phosphor-
ylated at Ser784, consistent with the similarity in amino acid
sequence of VCP surrounding Ser784 to the sequence of the
Chk2 peptide used to generate the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28)
antibody (Fig. 2C).

with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody, whereas no
phosphorylation at Ser784 was evident on the S784A mutant, as
expected (Fig. 2B). Thus, DNA-PK can phosphorylate VCP in vitro
at Ser784.
Multiple phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–related kinases
phosphorylate valosin-containing protein in vivo . The PIKK
family members ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK have overlapping
substrate specificities in vitro and often phosphorylate the same
substrates in vivo (1–4). Yet, these kinases differ in terms of
activation kinetics and the DNA-damaging agents they respond to.
ATM and DNA-PK respond primarily to DNA DSBs and are
activated rapidly after induction of the damage. ATR responds
primarily to replication blocks induced by UV light or various
chemical inhibitors and the kinetics of activation are slow,
reflecting the time it takes for the replication machinery to
encounter the damage (2, 3).
As a first step in examining which PIKK family members
phosphorylate VCP in vivo , we studied VCP phosphorylation in
M059J glioblastoma cells, which express mutant DNA-PK and
ATM, and in M059K cells, which are derived from the same
patient, but have wt DNA-PK and ATM (27). Both cell lines
contained similar levels of VCP. After exposure to bleomycin,
which causes DNA DSBs, VCP was phosphorylated at Ser784 in
both cell lines. However, at the early time points (15 and 30
minutes) after bleomycin treatment, VCP phosphorylation was
compromised in the M059J cells (Fig. 3A and B). The robust
phosphorylation of VCP in M059K cells could be inhibited by
wortmannin (Fig. 3A), a known inhibitor of PIKK family members
(28). Taken together, these results suggest that DNA-PK and/or
ATM phosphorylate VCP in vivo at early time points after DNA
damage, whereas at later time points, another kinase, probably
ATR, phosphorylates VCP.
A potential role of ATR in phosphorylating VCP at Ser784 was
examined by exposing M059J and M059K cells to UV light. In both
cell lines, VCP was phosphorylated at Ser784 in response to UV light
(Fig. 3C). Based on the kinetics of VCP phosphorylation and the
presence of mutant DNA-PK and ATM in M059J cells, we conclude
that ATR is the likely kinase phosphorylating VCP in cells exposed
to UV light.
Valosin-containing protein phosphorylated at Ser784 local-
izes at sites of DNA double-strand breaks. In cell extracts, the
major protein recognized by the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28)
antibody after induction of DNA damage was VCP (Fig. 1). We
used this same antibody to study by immunofluorescence the
intracellular localization of VCP phosphorylated at Ser784. In
nonirradiated U2OS osteosarcoma cells, the immunofluorescence
signal generated by the phosphoChk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody was
very weak, but after irradiation, the signal was intense and
corresponded to foci that colocalized with the ionizing radiation–
induced 53BP1 foci (Fig. 4A). These results suggested that VCP
phosphorylated at Ser784 localizes at sites of DNA DSBs. Several
additional observations support this conclusion.
First, we showed that the immunofluorescence signal was not due
to phosphorylated Chk2. In HCT15 colon carcinoma cells, which
express a mutant Chk2 protein that does not become phosphory-
lated in response to DNA damage (25, 29), the immunofluorescence
signal was as robust as in U2OS cells (Fig. 4B), consistent with the
phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody recognizing primarily phos-
phorylated VCP.
Second, under a variety of conditions, the immunofluorescence
signal correlated well with VCP phosphorylation at Ser784 as
monitored by immunoblotting. For example, by immunoblotting,
VCP phosphorylation at Ser784 was dependent on ATM at early
but not late time points after irradiation (Figs. 1 and 3; data not
shown). Immunofluorescence analysis of irradiated and nonirra-
diated primary fibroblasts from a normal individual (AG1522)
and from a patient with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT5BI) indicated
reactivity with the phospho-Chk2 (Thr26/Ser28) antibody at both
early (30 minutes) and late (8 hours) time points after irradiation
in the normal fibroblasts but only at the late time point in
ataxia-telangiectasia cells (Fig. 4C).
Third, phosphorylation of VCP, as phosphorylation of many
ATM substrates at sites of DNA DSBs (6, 25), was dependent on
53BP1 (6, 25). After suppression of 53BP1 expression by siRNA,
immunofluorescence analysis indicated that VCP phosphorylation
was also suppressed (Fig. 4D).
The strongest evidence that VCP phosphorylated at Ser784 was
present at sites of DNA DSBs came from immunoblotting
analysis of chromatin-enriched fractions from untreated and
irradiated U2OS cells (Fig. 5). Proteins that localize at sites of
DNA DSBs are typically present in the nucleoplasm in untreated
cells; but after DNA damage, a certain fraction of the protein is
associated with chromatin. We therefore prepared chromatin-
enriched fractions and matched whole cell extracts from
nonirradiated and irradiated U2OS cells and monitored VCP
subcellular localization and phosphorylation at Ser784 by immuno-
blotting (Fig. 5). VCP was present in the chromatin-enriched
fraction after irradiation. Furthermore, the chromatin-enriched
Figure 5. VCP phosphorylated at Ser784 is present in association with chromatin
in irradiated cells. Whole cell extracts (WCE ) and chromatin-enriched
fractions (ChromF ) were prepared from nonirradiated (0 Gy) or irradiated
(10 or 20 Gy) U2OS cells 15 minutes after irradiation and immunoblotted with the
phospho-Chk2 Thr26/Ser28 (pT26S28) antibody or antibodies that recognize VCP
or histone H3. Unlike the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 3, phosphorylated
VCP was not detected in the whole cell extracts in this experiment, because
70-fold less extract was used per lane.

fraction, whose quality was verified by immunoblotting for histone
H3, contained the majority of VCP phosphorylated at Ser784. Taken
together with the immunofluorescence analysis, these data
suggest that VCP phosphorylated at Ser784 is present at sites of
DNA DSBs.
Discussion
We have identified VCP as a new substrate of PIKK family
members in cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore,
we have mapped the site of phosphorylation as Ser784. These
findings suggest a role of VCP in the cellular response to DNA
damage and are consistent with previously published interactions
of VCP with BRCA1 and the WRN helicase (18–20).
The precise role of VCP in the DNA damage response remains to
be elucidated. VCP has multiple activities in eukaryotic cells (13).
The common underlying theme for all these activities is the
biochemical function of VCP as a chaperone that can unfold and
refold proteins. Many of the activities of VCP involve interactions
with polyubiquitinated proteins that VCP unfolds and delivers to
the proteasome for degradation (30–33). Other activities of VCP
involve unfolding of mono-or nonubiquitinated proteins, which are
then delivered to specific subcellular compartments, such as the
ER. By analogy, the role of VCP in the DNA damage response may
involve unfolding and removing ubiquitinated proteins from sites
of DNA damage. Indeed, the response of cells to DNA damage
involves several ubiquitination events. Post-replication repair is
mediated by the ubiquitin ligases Rad5 and Rad18, which
ubiquitinate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (34–36), whereas
the response of cells to DNA inter-strand cross-links involves
ubiquitination of FANCD2 (37). Furthermore, the DNA damage
checkpoint protein BRCA1, which has been reported to interact
with VCP (20), is a ubiquitin ligase, although its physiologic
substrates have not been identified (38, 39). Thus, it is possible that
VCP functions together with ubiquitin ligases at sites of DNA
damage. The ubiquitin ligases might modify proteins that VCP
would subsequently unfold and channel away from the site of DNA
damage.
According to this model, the significance of VCP phosphoryla-
tion at Ser784 might be to target VCP at sites of DNA breaks. The
specific cellular activity in which a specific VCP molecule
participates depends in part on its intracellular localization, which
in turn is regulated by COOH-terminal posttranslational modifica-
tions (40, 41). For example, phosphorylation of Tyr805 targets VCP
to the ER (40). By analogy, phosphorylation of Ser784 may target
VCP to sites of DNA damage.
