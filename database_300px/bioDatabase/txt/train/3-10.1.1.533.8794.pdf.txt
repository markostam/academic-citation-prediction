ABSTRACT
PBEQ-Solver provides a web-based graphical user
interface to read biomolecular structures, solve the
Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equations and interactively
visualize the electrostatic potential. PBEQ-Solver
calculates (i) electrostatic potential and solvation
free energy, (ii) protein–protein (DNA or RNA)
electrostatic interaction energy and (iii) pKa of a
selected titratable residue. All the calculations can
be performed in both aqueous solvent and mem-
brane environments (with a cylindrical pore in the
case of membrane). PBEQ-Solver uses the PBEQ
module in the biomolecular simulation program
CHARMM to solve the finite-difference PB equation
of molecules specified by users. Users can inter-
actively inspect the calculated electrostatic
potential on the solvent-accessible surface as
well as iso-electrostatic potential contours using
a novel online visualization tool based on Marvin-
Space molecular visualization software, a Java
applet integrated within CHARMM-GUI (http://
www.charmm-gui.org). To reduce the computational
time on the server, and to increase the efficiency in
visualization, all the PB calculations are performed
with coarse grid spacing (1.5 A˚ before and 1 A˚ after
focusing). PBEQ-Solver suggests various physical
parameters for PB calculations and users can modify
them if necessary. PBEQ-Solver is available at http://
www.charmm-gui.org/input/pbeqsolver.
INTRODUCTION
Implicit solvent treatments are approximate methods that
attempt to incorporate the average inﬂuence of the
molecular environment on a system of interest without
having to explicitly simulate the molecules constituting
this environment (1). Implicit solvent methods have
emerged as a popular strategy to approximate bulk
solvent or membrane environments and have been applied
successfully to protein–protein or protein–ligand binding
thermodynamics, scoring of protein conformations in
structure prediction, peptide and protein folding/unfold-
ing studies and ion channels (1–4). In particular, Poisson-
Boltzmann (PB) continuum electrostatics, in which the
solvent is represented as a featureless dielectric material, is
the most rigorous and popular method to estimate the
electrostatic solvation energy of a solute with an arbitrary
shape, and particular successes in applications to complex
biological problems are evident (2,5–7). The characteriza-
tion of the electrostatic potential on the macromolecular
surface by solving the PB equation is becoming a routine
practice in structural biology (5).
Over the last two decades, considerable eﬀorts have
been made to generalize and enhance the computational
methodologies and techniques to solve the PB equation
and visualize the calculated electrostatic potential (7–13).
As a result, various user-friendly programs that provide
numerical solutions of the PB equation using ﬁnite-
diﬀerence or ﬁnite-element methods with a discretized
grid are now available as standalone software such as
APBS (7), MEAD (14), Qniﬀt (15), DelPhi (16) and
Zap (17), or as modules in biomolecular modeling
and simulation programs such as PB solver (18) in
AMBER (19), PBEQ (12,20–22) in CHARMM (23),
APBS (7) in AMBER (7), CHARMM (23), TINKER
(24) and NAMD (25), and PB solver (26) in Jaguar (http://
www.schrodinger.com). PyMOL (27), VMD (28), GRASP
(29), PMV (30) and DINO (http://www.dino3d.org) (31)
provide various visualization tools for calculated electro-
static potentials. There are also several useful web-based
interfaces to setup and perform PB calculations such as
PDB2PQR (32), PCE (33) and PDB_Hydro (34).
We have developed PBEQ-Solver (http://www.charmm-
gui.org/input/pbeqsolver) to provide a web-based graphi-
cal user interface (GUI) to read biomolecular protein data

METHODS AND ILLUSTRATIVE RESULTS
PB theory
The electrostatic solvation energy Gelec is the work

Based on continuum electrostatics, the reaction ﬁeld

where " rð Þ,  rð Þ and  rð Þ are the dielectric constant, the
modiﬁed Debye–Hu¨ckel screening factor and the ﬁxed
charge density of the solute, respectively. For a given
dielectric constant in the interior of the solute ("p), ref rð Þ
is calculated by setting the dielectric constant to "ref
(dielectric constant of reference environment) at all points
in the solvent region, while s rð Þ is calculated by setting
the dielectric constant to "s (solvent dielectric constant)
and 2 rð Þ (from input concentration) in the solvent region.
The inﬂuence of biological membranes and cylindrical
pore can be incorporated into s rð Þ by setting the dielectric
constants to "m (membrane dielectric constant) and "c
(pore dielectric constant) in the membrane and pore
regions, respectively.
In the case of a biomolecular complex containing
proteins, DNA and RNA, the electrostatic interaction
energy in solvent between a selected chain [A] and the rest
[B] in the complex can be computed as

PDBReader
Since PBEQ-Solver uses the PBEQ module in CHARMM,
its ﬁrst step is to read a PDB ﬁle into CHARMM, which is
generally considered not to be straightforward due to
complexity of PDB ﬁles. In general, this is also the ﬁrst
diﬃculty that any simulation program users may face. It is
typically even harder to introduce diﬀerent protonation
states of titratable residues, disulﬁde bonds or other
posttranslational modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation.
For a seamless, eﬃcient procedure, PBEQ-Solver ﬁrst uses
PDB Reader in CHARMM-GUI that provides a ﬂexible
web-based GUI to convert a PDB ﬁle [downloaded from
RCSB (35), http://www.rcsb.org, or uploaded from user’s
computer] into CHARMM readable ﬁles with the follow-
ing options; (i) partial selection of protein chains as
well as model selection in the case of NMR structures,
(ii) modiﬁcation of engineered residues, (iii) terminal
group selection, (iv) protonation selection, (v) disulﬁde
bond selection, (vi) phosphorylation selection, (vii) gene-
ration of a biologically functional unit and (viii) gene-
ration of a crystal packing. The terminal patch residues
available in PDB Reader are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. If indicated in a PDB ﬁle, PDB Reader
automatically detects the disulﬁde bonds and displays
them. Users can always add or remove them in the list.
PDB Reader also automatically detects some of engi-
neered residues listed in Supplementary Table S2 and
converts them to corresponding natural residues. For
example, an engineered residue ‘Sep’ in a PDB ﬁle
represents a phosphorylated Ser residue. In such case,
PDB Reader automatically converts Sep to Ser and turns
on phosphorylation of the Ser residue (Supplementary
Figure S3). However, due to the complexity of PDB ﬁles
with various heteroatoms and other engineered residues, it
is users that need to check if all the residues to be read do
exist in a CHARMM topology ﬁle (currently, top_all27_
prot_na.rtf). If there are undetermined coordinates in
selected chains, PDB Reader simply builds them using a
predetermined internal coordinate table (‘IC BUILD’

command in CHARMM). The usages of PDB Reader is
well illustrated in a video demo, ‘PDB Reader Tutorial’,
available at the CHARMM-GUI website (http://www.
charmm-gui.org/?doc=demo).
It should be stressed that RCSB PDB structures do not
contain orientation information of a membrane(-bound)
protein relative to lipid bilayers. Therefore, in order to
perform reasonable PB calculations in a membrane
environment, users need to validate if the protein structure
is properly oriented with respect to membranes. It is
assumed that the membrane normal is parallel to the
Z-axis and its center by default is located at Z=0
(Table 1). Users can preorient the structure in their local
machine and upload it, or use preoriented protein struc-
tures from the OPM database (http://opm.phar.umich.
edu) (36) by selecting OPM as PDB download source
(Supplementary Figure S1).
PBEQ-Solver
After PDB Reader, PBEQ-Solver displays the options
for three types of PB calculations as well as adjustable
physical parameters summarized in Table 1 (see also
Supplementary Figure S4). Note that, to reduce the com-
putational time on the server and to increase the eﬃciency
in visualization, all the PB calculations are presently
performed with (unadjustable) coarse grid spacing
(Dcel_c=1.5 A˚ before and Dcel_f = 1 A˚ after focusing
(37)). All the PB calculations uses the molecular surface
(with a probe radius of 1.4 A˚) to setup the dielectric
boundary based on a set of atomic radii for proteins,
DNA and RNA that were optimized to closely reproduce
the charging free energies calculated by molecular
dynamics free energy simulations for standard amino
acids (20) and nucleic acids (22) (ﬁlename: step2_radii.str,
which is downloadable as shown in Supplementary
Figure S5).
PBEQ-Solver currently oﬀers three types of PB calcu-
lations for (i) electrostatic potential and solvation free
energy [based on Equation 1], (ii) protein–protein (DNA
or RNA) electrostatic interaction energy [based on
Equation 3] and (iii) pKa of a selected titratable residue
[based on Equation 4]. As mentioned before, all the
calculations can be performed in both aqueous solvent
and membrane environments (with a cylindrical pore in
the case of membrane). Based on the user’s inputs for the
physical parameters listed in Table 1, PBEQ-Solver uses
the PBEQ module in CHARMM to solve the ﬁnite-
diﬀerence PB equation of molecules speciﬁed by users
through PDB Reader. Note that a PDB ﬁle must contain
at least two chains for the electrostatic interaction calcul-
ations, such that the interaction energy is calculated
between a selected chain and the rest (Supplementary
Figure S8). In the case that only one chain is selected in
PDB Reader, the interaction energy option is not
available.
Tests and illustrations
We have tested PBEQ-Solver with 360 PDB structures
whose number of residues range from about 50 to 4000 to
examine the computational time to calculate the electro-
static solvation free energy (see Supplementary Table S3
for the full list of PDB IDs). Each test took about
1–14min on the server depending on the size of the
biomolecule. In addition, to validate if the CHARMM
input used in PBEQ-Solver is reliable, we have compared
the PB solvation energies calculated based on the PBEQ-
Solver input with those from other PB programs that are
published by Feig et al. (38). As shown in Supplementary
Table S4, the PBEQ-Solver input yields similar results to
other PB programs when the same parameters are used.
This also demonstrates that the visualization of calculated
potentials with the input and the coarse grid in PBEQ-
Solver is also reliable.
We have illustrated how to use PBEQ-Solver with an
example of PDB:1KDX (complex of KIX and phosphory-
lated KID domains) in Supplementary Material
(Figures S1–S11), including all the snapshots with some
useful annotations for the three types of PB calculations.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate various molecular graphics that
the users can generate using PBEQ-Solver. As shown in
Figure 1, the protein complex (PDB:1KDX) of the KIX
and phosphorylated KID domains that play an important
role in regulation by posttranslational modiﬁcation (39)
can be viewed with its ribbon representation, solvent-
accessible surface representation with electrostatic poten-
tial and iso-electrostatic potential contours. Note that the
unit for the bounds on electrostatic potential visualization
is kcal/(mole), where e is the unit charge. The iso-contour
map helps users to examine how the electrostatic
potentials are distributed in a distal place (other than on

It is clearly shown that the DNA binding site has the high

The web interfaces for PBEQ-Solver and PDB Reader
in CHARMM-GUI have been developed following
de facto web standards and extensively tested under
Firefox (version 2) and Safari (version 2). Although all
the functionalities work just ﬁne with diﬀerent web
browsers, we have so far found some minor inconsistency
of user interfaces in Internet Explorer (IE) and the beta
version of Safari (version 3). In the case of IE versions 6
and 7, some user interface elements look slightly diﬀerent
than those in Firefox and Safari. In the case of beta
version of Safari (version 3), the (job) monitoring panel
does not work properly.
CONCLUDING DISCUSSION & FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
We have described the functionalities of PBEQ-
Solver at the CHARMM-GUI website with illustrations.
There are several programs available for visualization of
electrostatic potential of biomolecules, calculated by
solving the PB equations, so that users can use them in
their local machines or generate images through web-
based visualization applications. However, we believe that
PBEQ-Solver provides unique and interactive web-based
GUI for online visualization. We recently found that
Honig and coworkers have made similar eﬀorts through
the Mark-US server, a functional annotation server
(http://luna.bioc.columbia.edu/honiglab/mark-us). In par-
ticular, such a GUI development will help non-expert
users, especially experimentalist, to perform various PB
calculations and visualize calculated electrostatic poten-
tials of their own systems. In a similar way, such an eﬀort
will be also useful for educational purposes.
The development of PBEQ-Solver is an ongoing
project. Its present drawback is to use relatively coarse
grid spacing [1.5 A˚ before and 1.0 A˚ after focusing (37)] for
eﬃcient PB calculations and visualization. However,
it is recommended to use 1–1.5 A˚ before and at least
0.5 A˚ after focusing in practical applications for solvation
energy calculations. One way to overcome this problem
is to download all the CHARMM input ﬁles and redo
the calculations with ﬁner grid spacing in users’ local
machines. We also expect to provide the ﬁner grid
