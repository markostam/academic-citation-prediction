ABSTRACT
Transposed elements (TEs) are mobile genetic
sequences. During the evolution of eukaryotes
TEs were inserted into active protein-coding genes,
affecting gene structure, expression and splicing
patterns, and protein sequences. Genomic inser-
tions of TEs also led to creation and expression of
new functional non-coding RNAs such as micro-
RNAs. We have constructed the TranspoGene
database, which covers TEs located inside protein-
coding genes of seven species: human, mouse,
chicken, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode and sea
squirt. TEs were classified according to location
within the gene: proximal promoter TEs, exonized
TEs (insertion within an intron that led to exon
creation), exonic TEs (insertion into an existing
exon) or intronic TEs. TranspoGene contains infor-
mation regarding specific type and family of the TEs,
genomic and mRNA location, sequence, supporting
transcript accession and alignment to the TE con-
sensus sequence. The database also contains host
gene specific data: gene name, genomic location,
Swiss-Prot and RefSeq accessions, diseases
associated with the gene and splicing pattern. In
addition, we created microTranspoGene: a database
of human, mouse, zebrafish and nematode TE-
derived microRNAs. The TranspoGene and micro-
TranspoGene databases can be used by researchers
interested in the effect of TE insertion on the
eukaryotic transcriptome. Publicly available
query interfaces to TranspoGene and micro-
TranspoGene are available at http://transpogene.
tau.ac.il/ and http://microtranspogene.tau.ac.il,
respectively. The entire database can be down-
loaded as flat files.
INTRODUCTION
Transposed elements (TEs) are mobile genetic sequences
that constitute 45%, 38%, 15–22%, 12%, and 9% of the
human, mouse, fruit ﬂy, nematode and chicken genomes,
respectively (1–4). TEs are distinguished by their mode of
propagation: short interspersed repeat elements (SINE),
long interspersed repeat elements (LINE) and retrovirus-
like elements with long-terminal repeats (LTR) are
propagated by reverse transcription of an RNA inter-
mediate. In contrast, DNA transposons move through a
direct ‘cut-and-paste’ mechanism (5).
TEs have shaped the eukaryotic genome and transcrip-
tome in several ways. Mammalian evolution was notably
aﬀected by TEs through their contribution to genetic
diversity, genomic expansion, genomic content and
genomic rearrangements (5,6). Although introns comprise
only 24% of the human genome, 60% of all TEs are
located in introns (7). L1 elements can signiﬁcantly
decrease mammalian gene expression when inserted
within introns, due to inadequate transcriptional elonga-
tion (8). Intronic TEs from all human and mouse
TE families can gain mutations leading to creation of
an additional exon in a process known as ‘exonization’.
The most prominent TE involved in exonization process
is the primate-speciﬁc Alu (7,9,10). TEs can also insert
into exons, a phenomenon that is common mainly
in the 50 and 30 untranslated region (UTR) exons, at
least in human and mouse (7). TE insertion elongates the
UTR and can serve as new cis-acting element such as
microRNA-binding site (11).
TE insertion can directly aﬀect gene expression when
the TE is incorporated into a gene promoter. The TE
sequence may provide transcription factor binding
sites previously not present in the promoter (12). About
25% of human promoter regions contain TE-derived
sequences, including many experimentally characterized
cis-regulatory elements (13). For example, some func-
tional binding sites of the transcriptional repressor REST

originated from duplication and insertion of RE1-
containing L2 and Alu retrotransposons (14). Not
only protein-coding genes are aﬀected by TE insertion.
A recent work by Borchert et al. (15) demonstrated that
several human microRNAs are transcribed by RNA
polymerase III through promoters and/or terminators
derived from the Alu retrotransposon. TEs can also
control eukaryotic genes epigenetically when inserted
within or very close to these genes (16,17).
TE insertion may create new functional non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs). The BC200 gene is a neuronal, primate-
speciﬁc ncRNA derived from a FLAM-C like monomeric
Alu (18). Smalheiser and Torvik (19) showed that a few
mammalian microRNA precursors are derived from
intronic insertion of two adjacent LINE retrotransposons
in opposite orientation, creating a hairpin structure that
serves as microRNA precursor. Other TEs, such as the
human MADE1, have an intrinsic hairpin structure and
serve as microRNA precursors when inserted into
transcriptionally active genomic regions (20). Many of
the newly identiﬁed Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are
derived from transposons and play a role in transposon
silencing in zebraﬁsh germ cells (21).
TE-related rearrangement events may be deleterious in
terms of ﬁtness of the organism. More than 25 human
genetic diseases are attributed to TE-related rearrange-
ments (22,23). Accumulation of TEs is also associated
with decrease in ﬁtness in fruit ﬂy (24). TE action
contributes to ﬁtness in other cases, however. For
example, it seems that a LINE-1 retrotransposon cata-
lyzed the creation of a chimeric gene that confers
resistance to HIV-1 infection in owl monkeys (25).
We previously generated a database of Alu elements
incorporated within protein-coding genes (26). Other
groups created other database specializing in LINEs (27)
and HERVs (28). All these databases focused on the
insertion of typical TE family members exclusively in the
human genome. The ScrapYard database (29) contains
TEs in a few vertebrate genomes but it is based on
Genbank only and it was updated in January 2002
for the last time. We have now created TranspoGene:
a database unifying all existing TE families for seven
vertebrate and invertebrate species, so that researchers
interested in the inﬂuence of various TEs on a speciﬁc
gene can ﬁnd this data in one location. The Transpo-
Gene website also includes another unique database:
microTranspoGene. This database contains human,
mouse, zebraﬁsh and nematode microRNA derived
from TEs either transcriptionally (from RNA pol III
promoters/terminators in Alu retrotransposons) or struc-
turally (through creation of the microRNA precursor
hairpin structure by TE insertion). The TranspoGene
database and website allow the user to retrieve important
data such as the location and sequence of the TE with
respect to the gene and the genome, supporting transcript
evidence, annotation of the gene and protein (including
related diseases), extensive splicing data for exonized
TEs, and the evolutionary change undergone from the
particular TE’s consensus sequence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Dataset of exonized TEs and intronic TEs in
protein-coding genes
Human NCBI 35 (hg17, May 2004), mouse NCBI33m
(mm6, March 2005), chicken (galGal3, May 2006), zebra-
ﬁsh (danRer4, March 2006), fruit ﬂy (dm2, April 2004),
Caenorhabditis elegans (ce2, March 2004) and sea squirt
(ci2, March 2005) assemblies were downloaded, along with
their annotations, from the UCSC genome browser
database (30). EST and cDNA mapping were obtained
from chrN_intronEST and chrN_mrna tables, respectively.
TE mapping data were obtained from chrN_rmsk tables
and TE sequences were retrieved from appropriate
genomes using the mapping data. A TE was considered
to be intragenic if there was no overlap with ESTs or cDNA
alignments; it was considered intronic if it was found within
an alignment of an EST or cDNA in an intronic region.
Finally, a TE was considered as an exonized TE if it was
found within an exonic part of the EST or cDNA, if it
possessed canonical splice sites, and if it was not the ﬁrst or
last exon of the EST/cDNA. Next we associated the
intronic and exonized TEs with genomic positions of
protein-coding genes. For human and mouse genomes we
used the list of known genes from UCSC table browser
after removal of protein-coding genes with relatively low
reliability (received from Fan Hsu, personal communica-
tion). These removed genes had no corresponding Protein
Data Bank, RefSeq mRNA or Swiss-Prot protein entries.
For the other ﬁve genomes, which are less completely
annotated than human and mouse genomes, we used
RefSeq (31) genes tables from the UCSC table browser
(30). Positions of the TE hosting intron/exon and the
mature mRNA were calculated using the gene tables
mentioned above. Association of the gene to the mRNA
and protein accessions and description from RefSeq and
Swiss-Prot was done through the kgXref and refLink tables
in the UCSC genome browser database (30).
Relevant data for exonization events
The 50 and 30 splice sites sequences of each TE-derived exon
were retrieved from the genome. Inclusion level of the exon
was calculated by dividing the number of deposited
transcripts supporting exon inclusion by the total number
of transcripts containing this exon. The splice mode (exon
skipping, constitutive splicing, alternative 50/30 splicing)
involving the exon was determined based on EST
and cDNA data. Expression of human exonized TEs
was based on expression in 11 normal human tissues
determined using the Aﬀymetrix exon chip 1.0; the
AﬀyHumanExon table was obtained from the UCSC
genome browser database (30). Data was associated with
TE according to genomic position overlap. A tissue was
associated with a speciﬁc exonized TE if the log-ratio
of median normalized signal in this tissue was50.75.
Dataset of TEs insertions within exons
Using Galaxy (32) we downloaded from the
UCSC table browser (33) the Repeat Masker (rmsk)
D48 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue
tables for the seven organisms of interest. We also
downloaded the exons of the human and mouse ﬁltered
genes (see above) and the exons of the RefSeq genes (31)
for the rest of the organisms. We searched for intersection
between the genomic intervals of TEs in rmsk (repeat
classes: DNA, LTR, SINE and LINE) and the exons,
where the TE was fully contained within an exon.
Dataset of TEs in putative proximal promoters
Transcription start sites (TSS) were retrieved from the
ﬁltered known gene tables of human and mouse genomes
(see description above) and the RefSeq (31) gene tables for
the ﬁve other organisms. In some cases, more than one
TSS existed per gene. Using the UCSC table browser (33),
a region of 250 bp upstream to the TSS was obtained. TEs
were deﬁned as DNA, LTR, SINE and LINE classes and
were obtained from the rmsk table of each of the seven
species in Ref. (33). Association between the TEs and
putative proximal promoter was based on genomic
position overlap.
Dataset of microRNA precursors derived from TEs
We downloaded the positions of human, mouse, chicken,
zebraﬁsh, fruit ﬂy and nematode microRNA precursors
from release 10.0 of miRBase (34). We searched using
Galaxy (32) for position intersection of microRNA
precursors with TEs (repeat classes DNA, LTR, SINE
and LINE) from rmsk table of each genome taken from
the UCSC table browser (33). Human microRNAs with
signiﬁcant experimental support for expression from RNA
pol III Alu promoters were received from Glen Borchert
from Iowa University (personal communication) based on
Ref. (15).
Human disease data
All human genes in the tables of TranspoGene were
associated with diseases data from the OMIM database
(35). The OMIM Morbidmap table was downloaded. The
ﬁltered known human genes table (see above) was
associated with diseases from Morbidmap table through
gene aliases taken from kgAlias table from the
UCSC table browser (33).
Alignments to TE consensus sequence
The TEs in TranspoGene were aligned to the consensus
sequences using Repeat Masker (www.repeatmasker.org)
version open-3.1.6, default mode. Repeat Masker was run
with cross_match version 0.990329, RepBase Update 9.11
(36), RM database version 20050112.
Modifying genomic positions to updated genome assemblies
We converted TranspoGene genomic positions of TEs and
their associated genetic elements using the liftOver tool
obtained from the UCSC genome browser (30). The
following conversions were done: human: hg17! hg18,
mouse: mm6!mm9, fruit ﬂy: dm2!dm3, nematode:
ce2! ce4.
Database and website
The TranspoGene data is stored in a relational database,
implemented with MySQL. The TranspoGene interface
was created using HTML and Java script and allows
access to database through HTML form. CGI script
written in Perl dynamically translates the data entered by
the user into the appropriate query to the database. The
entire database can be downloaded as ﬂat ﬁles from the
download section.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Until a few years ago TEs were often referred to as
‘junk DNA’. Makalowski suggested that TEs should be
viewed as genomic symbionts that create a ‘genomic scrap
yard’, the source of ‘junk’ that natural selection utilizes in
its evolutionary experiments (37). Recent studies revealed
the important role of these mobile elements in the
evolution of eukaryotic genomes, the regulation of cellular
processes, and their involvement in diseases. We have thus
constructed a database of TEs from seven organisms to
aid in eﬀort to analyze the inﬂuence of TEs on the
transcriptome of eukaryotes. Since construction of a
totally complete database would be virtually impossible,
we focused on data of high quality. This was done in
several ways:
(i) We supplied transcript accessions (EST/cDNA) to
support inclusion and skipping of exonized TEs and
intronic TEs, respectively.
(ii) Human and mouse genomes are annotated with
genes of low protein-coding potential. For example,
genes of millions nucleotides long, supported by
very few transcripts that often overlap with anno-
tated genes. Therefore, we used a list of genes for
which there is strong evidence for protein produc-
tion: genes with corresponding entries in PDB or
Swiss-Prot or corresponding RefSeq mRNA. These
human and mouse genes lists are ﬁltered lists and
shorter than the whole UCSC known genes lists
used by Sela et al. (7). Therefore, the numbers of
exonized TEs, intronic and exonic TEs are diﬀerent
in TranspoGene database and in Sela et al. research.
For the other ﬁve organisms we used the high-
standard RefSeq genes (31).
(iii) We improved the experimental support for exoniza-
tions, which were originally based on ESTs. For
human exonized TEs, we added expression data in
healthy tissues from Aﬀymetrix exon chips (38).
There were 414 (29%) exonized TEs of those with
EST evidence expressed in at least one of the 11
human healthy tissues hybridized on the microarray.
The rest of the exonized TEs either did not have a
designed probe on the chip (31%) or might be
expressed in tissues that were not examined (40%).
Consisting with our previous publications, most of
TE exonizations are alternatively spliced (7,9,10,39).
We calculated the inclusion level of the exon from
the number of deposited transcripts supporting exon
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue D49
inclusion divided by the total number of transcripts
containing the ﬂanking exons. We annotated the
exonized TE with the splice mode involved: exon
skipping, constitutive splicing, alternative 50/30 spli-
cing. We also supplied the splice site sequence for
each exonized TE.
(iv) To avoid false positives in the identiﬁcation of TEs
located in putative promoter regions, we used only
predicted proximal promoters, which are located
just upstream (within 250 nt of the gene’s TSS.
(v) The microTranspoGene database is based on
published data, some of which is experimentally
validated (15,19,20).
The TranspoGene and microTranspoGene databases
contain millions of TEs with validated or predicted
eﬀect on the transcriptome of seven species. Table 1
exempliﬁes TranspoGene and microTranspoGene content
for human and mouse genomes, both of which share
a very high TE content and many annotated protein-
coding genes.
Website usage
The TranspoGene website is user-friendly and allows easy
searching of the database. Through the TranspoGene
webpage (available at http://transpogene.tau.ac.il) the
user initially selects genomic area of interest: gene name,
protein/mRNA accession from RefSeq or Swiss-Prot, or
absolute genomic positions in a speciﬁc organism. The
user can also insert a list of gene names, possibly from
diﬀerent organisms. The MySQL wildcard sign (%) can be
also used for searching genes with similar names.
Afterwards the user selects the TE family of interest,
where multiple selection of TE families within an
organism and/or between organisms is enabled. Finally
the TE type according to location in the gene is selected:
intronic TE, exonized TE, TE in proximal promoter or
exonic TE (multiple types can be selected). The result of
the query is provided both in a table format and in a ﬁle
ready for download. An example for the result of
TranspoGene search is given in Figure 1. The results
contain links to RefSeq (31), Swiss-Prot (40), OMIM (35)
and to the UCSC genome browser (41) in order to provide
further information about the relevant transcript, protein,
disease and genomic region, respectively. To detect
mutations that accumulated in a given TE, the user can
view the alignment ﬁle of the TE sequence to its consensus
sequence, through a link given in the query results table.
For exonized TEs, the overlap between the exon and its
overlapping TE is emphasized by use of diﬀerent colors.
The microTranspoGene webpage (http://microtranspo-
gene.tau.ac.il/) allows selection of either microRNA
precursors structurally derived from TEs or human
microRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III
using Alu promoters/terminators. It allows searching for a
speciﬁc microRNA precursor in the database, selection of
all relevant microRNAs of a speciﬁc species or all
microRNA precursors in the database from all organisms.
Supplementary Figure 1 demonstrates partial micro-
TranspoGene results for searching human microRNA
precursors structurally derived from TEs. The entire
database can be downloaded as ﬂat ﬁles from the
