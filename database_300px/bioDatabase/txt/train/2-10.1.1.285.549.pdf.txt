ABSTRACT
In both budding and fission yeasts, a null mutation
of the DNA2 gene is lethal. In contrast, a null mutation
of Caenorhabditis elegans dna21 causes a
delayed lethality, allowing survival of some mutant
C.elegans adults to F2 generation. In order to under-
stand reasons for this difference in requirement of
Dna2 between these organisms, we examined the
enzymatic properties of the recombinant C.elegans
Dna2 (CeDna2) and its interaction with replication-
protein A (RPA) from various sources. Like budding
yeast Dna2, CeDna2 possesses DNA-dependent
ATPase, helicase and endonuclease activities. The
specific activities of both ATPase and endonuclease
activities of the CeDna2 were considerably higher
than the yeast Dna2 (10- and 20-fold, respectively).
CeDna2 endonuclease efficiently degraded a short 50
single-stranded DNA tail (,10 nt) that was hardly
cleaved by ScDna2. Both endonuclease and helicase
activities of CeDna2 were stimulated by CeRPA, but
not by human or yeast RPA, demonstrating a species-
specific interaction between Dna2 and RPA. These
and other enzymatic properties of CeDna2 described
in this paper may shed light on the observation that
C.elegans is less stringently dependent on Dna2 for
its viability than Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We pro-
pose that flaps generated by DNA polymerase d-medi-
ated displacement DNA synthesis are mostly short in
C.elegans eukaryotes, and hence less dependent on
Dna2 for viability.
INTRODUCTION
Okazaki fragments are generated during lagging strand DNA
synthesis at replication forks and processed through a complex
series of enzymatic events prior to being joined to form a
contiguous DNA strand (1–6). In eukaryotes, Okazaki frag-
ment synthesis is initiated with the synthesis of a short RNA–
DNA primer by the polymerase (pol) a-primase complex,
followed by its elongation by pol d to produce full-length
Okazaki fragments (7,8). The RNA–DNA primers at the
50 end of each Okazaki fragment are then processed by nuc-
leases, leading to the generation of ligatable nicks that are
sealed by DNA ligase I. Nucleases involved in this process
include RNase H, Fen1 and Dna2 (3,6,9,10). RNase H and
Fen1 were first implicated in the removal of the RNA primers
in in vitro reconstitution experiments using a plasmid contain-
ing the simian virus 40 replication origin or well-defined syn-
thetic DNA substrates (3,6,10). The DNA2 gene was first
identified through a screen for DNA replication mutants of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11). It encodes an essential 172 kDa
protein that possesses single-stranded (ss) DNA-dependent
ATPase, DNA helicase and ssDNA-specific endonuclease
activities (11–16). The endonuclease activity of S.cerevisiae
Dna2 (ScDna2) has a strong preference for a 50-free ssDNA
tail and is stimulated by the presence of a 50-RNA segment in
the flap (13,17). This and other properties of ScDna2 suggest
that it is well suited to process Okazaki fragments during
lagging strand synthesis (18). ScDna2 helicase activity dis-
places duplex DNA in the 50 to 30 direction, does not require
preexisting fork structures and acts in a highly distributive
fashion. It is able to resolve a secondary structure in the flap,
thereby facilitating the endonucleolytic cleavage of the flap by
its intrinsic endonuclease activity (14). Flap structures of the

primer RNA–DNA ends of Okazaki fragments are generated
by a displacement DNA synthesis reaction catalyzed by pol
d (17,19,20). Since ScDna2 is unable to completely remove
the flap structure, its action results in the shortening of the flap
(6 nt). In contrast, Fen1 cleaves at the junction of single-
stranded flap and double-stranded DNAs, creating nicks that
can be readily joined by DNA ligase I. In vitro experiments
showed that both endonuclease and helicase activities of
ScDna2 were stimulated by replication-protein A (RPA) at
physiological salt concentrations (19). However, the cleavage
of flaps by Fen1 alone was markedly inhibited by RPA. This
inhibition was relieved by the addition of Dna2, suggesting
that flaps long enough to bind RPA stably are processed
by Dna2, and the remaining shortened flaps are processed
by Fen1 (19). In the presence of RPA, the sequential
action of the two endonucleases Dna2 and Fen1 ultimately
leads to the formation of ligatable nicks. The sealing of the
nicks by DNA ligase I completes the processing of Okazaki
fragments.
Dna2 proteins are well conserved throughout eukaryotes
that include humans, plants, fish, fission yeasts, frogs and
nematodes (18,21–23), and share the catalytic domains for
endonuclease and helicase of Dna2 (24,25). Though the motifs
for endonuclease and helicase activities are well conserved,
the enzymatic activities associated with each protein vary. For
example, ScDna2 contains both endonuclease and helicase
activities. In contrast, Xenopus laevis Dna2 possesses
endonuclease activity but lacks helicase activity (21).
Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dna2 is also devoid of helicase
activity (H.Y. Kang, unpublished data). In addition, there is a
difference in the primary structures of various eukaryotic
Dna2 proteins. Most notably, no significant homology is
found in the N-terminal regions of Dna2 proteins and they
also vary in size (21). S.cerevisiae or S.pombe Dna2 has an
extra 350–400 amino acid region at their N-termini, which is
much shorter or absent in the metazoan Dna2 enzymes. The
N-terminal 405 amino acid region of yeast Dna2 is dispensable
for endonuclease and helicase activities (26). However, mutant
yeast cells containing Dna2 devoid of the N-terminal
405 amino acid region show a temperature-dependent growth
defect that can be suppressed by the multicopy expression of
RPA (19,26). However, the N-terminal domain is required for
maximal stimulation of ScDna2 by RPA (27).
We found that metazoan and single cell organisms differ in
their Dna2 requirement for viability. Deletion of Dna2 in
Caenorhabditis elegans did not cause complete embryonic
lethality since some of the mutants survived into the F2 gen-
eration (28), whereas it is absolutely essential in S.cerevisiae
and S.pombe (11,18). This situation is reversed regarding the
requirement for Fen1 (28–30); deletion of Fen1 resulted in
embryonic lethality in mice and C.elegans, whereas it was not
essential in the yeasts. These observations suggest that the
strategy of processing for the processing of Okazaki fragments
in lower and higher eukaryotes may differ. In order to under-
stand the significance of the differences in the Dna2-deletion
phenotypes described above and the mechanisms of Okazaki
fragment processing in multicellular organisms, we have isol-
ated and characterized the Dna2 enzyme of C.elegans. For this
purpose, we have purified the wild-type and two mutant
C.elegans Dna2 (CeDna2) proteins and C.elegans RPA
(CeRPA) and examined their biochemical properties. Based
on their enzymatic properties described here, we suggest that
the pol d-mediated displacement DNA synthesis varies in
eukaryotes, which in turn affects the Dna2 requirement for
the processing of Okazaki fragments.

Construction of recombinant baculoviruses to
overproduce CeDna2
The plasmid pBS-Cedna2 that contained a complete cDNA
encoding CeDna2 (28) was used to amplify the full-length
cDNA fragment encoding CeDna2 using the primers
50-AAA ACT AGT ATG GAG TCT CGC AAA AGA CAG
CTC CAA AAT GTC-30 and 50-AAA GGT ACC TTA GAG

The amplified fragments were digested with SpeI and KpnI
and cloned into the pFastBacHTb vector (Gibco-BRL) cleaved
with the same restriction enzymes to generate pFastBacHTb-
Cedna2. The two synthetic oligonucleotides (50-AAA ACT

AGT TTT-30) were annealed to form a duplex DNA that
encodes two tandem FLAG epitopes. The duplex DNA was
cleaved with SpeI, followed by insertion into the unique SpeI
site in pFastBacHTb-FCedna2. The orientation was confirmed
by nucleotide sequence determination. We transformed the
pFasBacHTb-FCedna2 plasmid into DH10Bac Escherichia
coli cell (Gibco BRL), and generated recombinant baculovir-
uses overexpressing CeDna2 according to the manufacturer’s
procedures. The recombinant CeDna2 protein produced this
way contained a hexahistidine tag (from the vector) and two
tandem FLAG epitopes.
A specific point mutation that abolishes ATPase or endo-
nuclease activity of CeDna2 was introduced into CeDna2
in pFastBacHTb-FCedna2 using the QuikChangeTM site-
directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers
used were as follows: (the mutagenic nucleotide is underlined)

A-30 (D320A, endonuclease-negative mutation) and 50-CTG
CCA GGA TCT GGA GAA ACG ACT CTA ATC T-30
(K678E, ATPase-negative mutation). We carried out site-
directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer’s proced-
ure, and isolated pFastBacHTb-FCedna2 containing the
desired mutations (verified by nucleotide sequence analysis).
These plasmids were used to construct recombinant baculovir-
uses that express mutant CeDna2 enzymes as described above
for wild-type CeDNA.
Cloning and overexpression of CeRPA
The two cDNAs encoding the large subunit (accession no.
AAB63407; 655 amino acids) and the middle subunit (acces-
sion no. AAK71380; 288 amino acids) of CeRPA were amp-
lified from C.elegans cDNA library (Clontech) by PCRs using
two sets of primers: 50-TTA AGC TTA TGG CGG CAA TTC

CGT C-30 (the middle subunit). The cDNA for the small sub-
unit (accession no. AAB37031; 143 amino acids) of CeRPA
was reconstituted using synthetic oligonucleotides (sequences
of which are available upon request). Briefly, five template
oligonucleotides (75–99 nt long) encompassing the entire open
reading frame of the small subunit were annealed with four
other oligonucleotides (30 nt long) that are complementary to
the 30 and 50 end 15 nt of the template oligonucleotides. The
nicks produced upon annealing were sealed by T4 DNA ligase.
The resulting linear single-stranded template was then amp-
lified by PCR using the two oligonucleotides 50-AAG GAT

The amplified PCR fragments cleaved by HindIII (large sub-
unit) and NotI (middle subunit) were cloned into pET-Duet
vector (Novagen) stepwise to obtain pET-Duet-CeRPA1&2.
The orientation of the inserts and their nucleotide sequence
were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression vector
thus constructed produced the large RPA subunit as a fusion
protein with additional amino acids (MGSSHHHHHHSQD;
in boldface, a hexahistidine tag) at its N-terminus, while the
middle subunit as wild type. The amplified PCR fragments of
the small RPA subunit were digested by NdeI and then ligated
into pACYC-Duet vector (Novagen) to obtain pACYC-Duet-
CeRPA3. The small subunit expressed from this vector
contained no additional amino acids.
Purification of recombinant CeDna2 and RPA proteins
The recombinant baculovirus expressing CeDna2 was infected
into Sf-9 insect cells for 48 h at a multiplicity of infection of
10. Infected cells (2 · 106 cells/ml, 1 liter) were harvested,
resuspended in 80 ml of buffer T (25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5,
1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM phenyl-
methlysulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 mg/ml leupeptin and antipain)
containing 100 mM NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40, and disrupted
by sonication (10 cycles of a 30 s pulse and a 30 s cooling
interval). The extracts were cleared by centrifuging at
37 000 r.p.m. for 1 h in a Beckman 45Ti rotor, and the super-
natant (0.9 mg/ml, 80 ml) was applied directly to a 10 ml
Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilib-
rated with buffer T plus 100 mM NaCl (buffer T100, hereafter,
the number indicates the concentration of NaCl added to buffer
T). The column was washed with 10-column volumes of the
same buffer containing neither DTT nor EDTA and eluted
with buffer T500 (DTT and EDTA) plus 5 mM imidazole.
The peak fractions (0.68 mg/ml, 25 ml) were pooled and
loaded onto a Ni+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) column (2 ml)
equilibrated with buffer T500 (DTT and EDTA) plus
5 mM imidazole. After extensive washing with buffer T500
(DTT and EDTA) plus 20 mM imidazole, the column was
eluted with buffer T500 plus 400 mM imidazole. The eluted
fractions (1.4 mg/ml, 5 ml) were pooled, mixed with 400 ml of
anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated with
buffer T500 and incubated at 4
C for 4 h on a rocking platform.
After washing three times with 4 ml of buffer T500 and three
times with 4 ml of buffer T200, bound protein was eluted three
times by incubation at 4C for 30 min with 400 ml of buffer
T200 containing 0.2 mg/ml of the FLAG peptide. The first
eluted fraction (0.19 mg/ml, 0.4 ml) contained >70% of total
protein recovered and was >95% pure. This fraction was stored
at 80C.
Recombinant yeast and human RPAs were purified from
E.coli as described previously (27,31). Recombinant CeRPA
from E.coli was purified similarly as for human RPA, but with
modifications; Blue-Sepharose column chromatography was

omitted and a glycerol gradient sedimentation step was
included. The two expression vectors, pET-Duet-CeRPA1&2
and pACYC-Duet-CeRPA3, were co-transformed into BL21
(DE3), and the expression of three RPA subunits were induced
with 0.4 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells
(1.5 liter culture) were harvested, suspended in 40 ml of T500
without EDTA and DTT, and disrupted as described previ-
ously (27). Crude extracts obtained were cleared by centrifu-
ging at 37 000 r.p.m. for 1 h in a Beckman 45Ti rotor, and the
supernatant (4.5 mg/ml, 40 ml) was applied directly to a 5 ml
Ni+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) column equilibrated with buffer
T500 (DTT and EDTA) plus 5 mM imidazole. After wash-
ing the column with 25 ml of T100 (DTT and EDTA) plus
30 mM imidazole, proteins were eluted with T100 (DTT and
EDTA) plus 400 mM imidazole. The peak protein fractions
(1.0 mg/ml, 16ml) were pooled and applied to a 1 ml Hitrap
Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. This
column was washed with 10 ml of T100, followed by elution
with a 15 ml linear gradient (100–600 mM) of NaCl in T
buffer. The peak protein fractions eluting at 350 mM
NaCl were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon centri-
fugal filter device (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The concentrated CeRPA (1.2 mg/ml,
0.5 ml) was loaded onto a glycerol gradient (5 ml, 15–35% gly-
cerol in T250) and subjected to centrifugation at 45 000 r.p.m.
for 24 h in a SW 55Ti rotor (Beckman) at 4C. Fractions were
collected from the bottom of the gradient and analyzed by
SDS–PAGE. The peak protein fractions (>95% in purity)
lacked any detectable nuclease and ATPase activities and
were stored at 80C.
Preparation of substrates for the helicase and
nuclease activity assay
The DNA substrates used to measure helicase activity of
CeDna2 were constructed by hybridizing the oligonucleotides
listed in Table 1 to FX174 single-stranded circular (ssc) DNA
and purified as described previously (13). These partial duplex
substrates used to characterizing the helicase and endo-
nuclease activities of CeDna2 were prepared as described
previously (17) using the synthetic oligonucleotides listed
in Table 1. Labeling of the 50 or 30 ends of the substrates
was as described previously (17). The structure of DNA
substrates and position of radioisotope labels are indicated
in each figure.
Enzyme assays
The DNA-dependent ATPase activity was measured in a reac-
tion mixture (20 ml) containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8,
2 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 250 mM cold
ATP, 8.25 nM [g-32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mmol) and 50 ng of
M13 ssDNA when necessary. After incubation at 37C for
10 min, an aliquot (2 ml) was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-
cellulose plate (J. T. Baker) and developed in a 0.5 M LiCl/
1.0 M formic acid. The products were analyzed using a
PhosphorImager (Fuji).
Helicase assays were performed with the endonuclease-
deficient mutant enzyme, HF-CeDna2D320A. The standard
reaction mixtures (20 ml) contained 50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.8, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 0.25 mg/ml
BSA and the 50-32P-labeled partial duplex DNA substrate
(15 fmol). After incubation at 37C for 10 min, reactions
were stopped with 4 ml of 6· stop solution [60 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0, 40% (w/v) sucrose, 0.6% SDS, 0.25% bromophenol
blue and 0.25% xylene cyanol]. The reaction products were
subjected to electrophoresis for 40 min at 180 V through a 10%
polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS in 0.5· TBE (45 mM
Tris base, 45 mM boric acid and 1 mM EDTA). The gel
was dried on DEAE-cellulose paper and autoradiographed.
Labeled DNA products were quantitated with the use of a
PhosphorImager.
To measure endonuclease activity of CeDna2, we used the
standard reaction mixtures (20 ml) containing 50 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA and
the 50- or 30-32P-labeled DNA substrate (15 fmol). After
incubation at 37C for 10 min, reactions were stopped with
6· stop solution. The cleavage products were resolved on a
10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS in 0.5· TBE
(electrophoresis for 40 min at 150 V) or on a 20% sequencing
gel for high resolution. The gel was dried on DEAE-cellulose
paper and autoradiographed. The amount of products formed
was measured using a PhosphorImager. Enzymes were diluted
to appropriate concentrations prior to use in buffer containing
50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 10%
glycerol, 0.5 M NaCl and 0.02% Nonidet P-40.
RESULTS
Purification of recombinant CeDna2 enzymes
To facilitate the detection and purification of recombinant
wild-type CeDna2 enzyme, hexahistidine and two tandem
FLAG epitopes were fused to the N-terminus of CeDna2
(HF-CeDna2). HF-CeDna2 was purified from cell-free
extracts prepared from insect cells infected with recombinant
baculoviruses expressing HF-CeDna2 using Q-Sepharose,
Ni+-NTA agarose and anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose column
chromatography as described in ‘Materials and Methods.’
As shown in Figure 1, crude extracts, fractions from each
purification step and purified HF-CeDna2 were subjected to
8% SDS–PAGE. The gels in duplicate were Coomassie
stained (Figure 1, lanes 1–7) and analyzed by western blotting
(Figure 1, lanes 8–14). Expression of wild-type CeDna2 was
detected in the crude extracts prepared from infected, but not
from uninfected insect cells with monoclonal antibodies
against the hexahistidine epitope (Figure 1, compare lanes 8
and 9). Each purification step progressively enriched
HF-CeDna2 (Figure 1, lanes 2–5 and 9–12), resulting in
the preparation of CeDna2 of purity >95% after the final
anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose chromatographic step (Figure 1,
lanes 5 and 12). To prepare endonuclease- and ATPase-
deficient mutant enzymes, conserved amino acid in CeDna2
(corresponding to those critical for endonuclease and ATPase
activities of S.cerevisiae Dna2) was changed (14,24). Altera-
tion of Asp320 to Ala and Lys678 to Glu resulted in the
formation of the endonuclease-deficient (HF-CeDna2D320A)
and ATPase/helicase-deficient (HF-CeDna2K678E) CeDna2,
respectively. The two mutant enzymes were purified using the
same procedure described for the wild-type enzyme. The
purity and yield of the mutant enzymes were comparable
with those of wild-type CeDna2 (data not shown) (Figure 1A,
lanes 6 and 7; lanes 13 and 14).
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 4 1375
In order to examine the influence of RPA on CeDna2, we
isolated the CeRPA. A database search for protein sequences
similar to S.pombe RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3 yielded hypothet-
ical proteins homologous to each subunit from C.elegans
(accession no. AAB63407, 655 amino acids; accession
no. AKK71380, 288 amino acids; and accession no.
AAB37031, 143 amino acids, respectively). cDNAs encoding
these three CeRPA subunits cloned from C.elegans cDNA
libraries were coexpressed in E.coli and purified as described
in ‘Materials and Methods’. Although all three proteins were
expressed relatively efficiently in soluble forms (data not
shown), the small subunit of CeRPA was not present in the
final preparation of CeRPA unlike the human and yeast RPA
preparations (Figure 1B). Densitometric analysis of the final
preparation indicated that the large and middle subunits were
stoichiometric (data not shown). This is an unexpected finding
since the large subunit of RPA can associate with a preas-
sembled sub-complex containing the middle and small sub-
units in human RPA (31,32). AAB37031 appears to encode a
CeRPA3 subunit that contains an additional 23 amino acid
peptide at its N-terminus unlike other RPA3 proteins. If this
region is excluded in alignment analysis, AAB37031 showed a
weak, but significant sequence homology (identity 20–29%) to
RPA3 from human, S.cerevisiae and S.pombe (data not
shown). This level of homology is slightly lower than those
(31–38%) found among human, S.cerevisiae and S.pombe
RPA3. At present, however, we cannot rule out the possibility
that the putative CeRPA3 subunit we have cloned is not the
authentic CeRPA3 subunit.
Enzymatic activities of recombinant CeDna2 enzymes
The CeDna2 preparations described above were examined for
the presence of DNA-dependent ATPase and endonuclease
activities (Figure 2). The ATPase-deficient mutant
(HF-CeDna2K678E) enzyme did not hydrolyze ATP at any
concentrations of protein used (Figure 2A), while the wild-
type and endonuclease-deficient mutant (HF-CeDna2D320A)
proteins exhibited comparable ATPase activities (Figure 2A).
Wild-type CeDna2 was dependent on the presence of ssDNA
for the hydrolysis of ATP (Figure 2A). HF-CeDna2 and
HF-CeDna2K678E cleaved a Y-structured 50 end labeled sub-
strate with indistinguishable efficiency (Figure 2B, compare
lanes 1–4 and 11–14), whereas HF-CeDna2D320A was com-
pletely inactive (Figure 2B, lanes 6–9). These results indicate
that each point mutation inactivated the enzymatic activity of
interest as intended.
Both helicase and endonuclease activities of
CeDna2 act preferentially upon 50 ssDNA tails
Since the endonuclease activity of CeDna2 cleaved substrate
DNAs, HF-CeDna2D320A was used to characterize the DNA
helicase activity of CeDna2. We first determined the polarity
of duplex unwinding by this CeDna2 mutant enzyme. As
shown in Figure 3A, HF-CeDna2D320A displaced a partial
duplex DNA substrate containing a 50 ssDNA tail (Figure 3A,
lanes 7–12), but not a 30-tailed ssDNA (Figure 3A, lanes 1–6),
indicating that this enzyme translocates and unwinds duplex
DNA in the 50 to 30 direction. The DNA substrate with ssDNA
flanked by duplex DNA at both ends was hardly unwound
by the CeDna2 helicase (Figure 3A, lanes 13–18). We also
examined whether a forked DNA structure influenced the
CeDna2 helicase activity. For this purpose, two DNA sub-
strates were prepared, one containing a 25 nt 30 ssDNA tail
and the other without any tail (Figure 3B). Unwinding of the
two substrates by CeDna2 was comparable when the same
amounts of enzyme were used (Figure 3B), suggesting that
a forked DNA structure does not stimulate the helicase activity
of CeDna2.
We then examined the endonuclease activity of CeDna2
using the same three substrates that were used to determine
the polarity of CeDna2 helicase activity (Figure 3A). These
three substrates were labeled at either the 50 or 30 end of the
template DNA (Figure 3C). HF-CeDna2 degraded the 50 over-
hang substrate most efficiently (Figure 3C, lanes 9–12), and
hardly degraded the 30 overhang substrate. The amount of the

60 nt 50 tail cleaved with 0.05 ng (0.6 fmol) of CeDna2 was
7.2 fmol (Figure 3C, lane 9), while the amount of the 60 nt 30
tail cleaved with 10-fold more enzyme was only 1.8 fmol
(Figure 3C, lane 6). Thus, the cleavage efficiency of the
50 ssDNA tail by CeDna2 was at least 40-fold greater than
that of the 30 ssDNA tail. These results also indicate that
CeDna2 acts in a highly catalytic fashion in cleaving a
50 ssDNA tail. Consistent with the result that a DNA substrate
with ssDNA flanked by partial duplexes at both ends was
hardly unwound by CeDna2 helicase, it was poorly degraded
even in the presence of considerably higher levels (0.5–10 ng)
of CeDna2 (Figure 3C, lanes 15–18). Our results above
demonstrate that CeDna2 requires a 50 free ssDNA end for
endonucleolytic cleavage as well as for duplex unwinding.
CeDna2 can utilize short 50 ssDNA tails for
endonuclease and helicase activity
In our preliminary studies, we found that a 50 ssDNA tailed
(>10 nt) DNA substrate was efficiently degraded to 2–3 nt
sized products by CeDna2 endonuclease activity (data not
shown and see below). In contrast, the 50 ssDNA tails left
after cleavage by ScDna2 were highly heterogeneous and
longer (>6 nt) than those generated by CeDna2 (17). This
result indicates that CeDna2 can cleave very short 50 ssDNA
tails. In order to determine the minimal length of the 50 tail
ssDNA cleaved by CeDna2, several substrates with varying
50 ssDNA tail lengths (Figure 4A, 5–10 nt and 25 nt) were
examined. In this experiment, we used two different concen-
trations of Mg2+ (0.5 and 5 mM), since the size of cleavage
products was significantly affected by Mg2+ concentrations
used (data not shown). In the presence of 0.5 mM MgCl2,
CeDna2 released substantial levels of 10–11 nt long products
from the 50 oligo (dT)25 tail substrate (Figure 4A, lane 7),
whereas substrates with short 50 oligo (dT)5–8 tails were poorly
cleaved by CeDna2 (Figure 4A, lanes 1–4). When the oligo
(dT) is >8 nt, cleavage occurred efficiently (Figure 4A, lanes 5
and 6). Although the oligo (dT)25 tail gave rise to 10–12 nt
cleavage products, the most prominent products from 50 oligo
(dT)6–10 were 5 nt. Products longer than the size of the

amounts of enzyme. The mixtures were incubated at 37C for 10 min, and the hydrolysis of ATP was measured as described previously (14). Closed and open symbols
in the plot denote that ATPase activity of each enzyme used was measured in the presence and absence of M13 sscDNA, respectively. The experiment was repeated
four times, and the average of the four experiments is shown with error bars as indicated. (B) Endonuclease activity of purified recombinant wild-type and mutant
CeDna2 enzymes was measured with the Y-structured substrate as indicated at the top of the Figure. The position of the 50 32P-labeled end (denoted as asterisks) is as

reaction mixtures as described in ‘Materials and Methods’. Cleavage products formed were analyzed in 10% acrylamide gel as described previously (13). The amount
(fmol) of cleavage product formed is indicated at the bottom of the gel. For the reactions shown in lanes 5, 10 and 15, Mg2+ was omitted.

50 ssDNA tail were also produced. These products were
formed most likely due to the melting of the duplex region
at low Mg2+ concentrations since they were not observed in
higher Mg2+ concentrations (see below). CeDna2 catalyzed
cleavage of the 50 oligo (dT)6–10 tails more efficiently at
5 mM than at 0.5 mM Mg2+. When the length of the 50 oligo
(dT) tail was varied from 7 to 25 nt, the major cleavage product
was 5 nt long (Figure 4A, lanes 10–14). In the presence of
5 mM Mg2+, cleavage products longer than the length of 50 tail
of the substrate were hardly observed unlike reactions carried
out with 0.5 mM Mg2+. Since the CeDna2 endonuclease reac-
tion is more specific and efficient with 5 mM of Mg2+, all of the
subsequent endonuclease assays in this report contained 5 mM
of Mg2+. We also examined the influence of levels of
HF-CeDna2 on the cleavage of 50 oligo (dT)-tailed substrates
of various lengths. In keeping with the results described above,
the efficiency of nuclease activity increased as the 50 ssDNA
tail length was increased (Figure 4B). We also examined the
influence of the length of the 50 oligo (dT) tails on the helicase
activity of CeDna2D320A. Unwinding of the substrate was
observed when it contained a 50 oligo (dT) tail longer than 8 nt
(Figure 4C).
A comparison of the cleavage activity of ScDna2 and
CeDna2 was carried out with two substrates containing a
50 oligo (dT)7 or (dT)10 tail (Figure 5). Both 50 oligo (dT)7
and (dT)10 tails were much more efficiently (30–40-fold)

bottom of the figure. Note that increased levels (10–20-fold) of wild-type HF-CeDna2 were used for the cleavage of the substrate with internal ssDNA flanked by

degraded by CeDna2 than by ScDna2 (Figure 5). CeDna2
(0.2 ng, 1.7 fmol) cleaved 2.6 fmol of the 50 oligo (dT)7 tail
and 10.8 fmol of the 50 oligo (dT)10 tail (Figure 5, lanes 2 and
9, respectively), indicating that CeDna2 can act catalytically in
cleavage of the short 50 ssDNA tail. In contrast, ScDna2 hardly
cleaved the 50 oligo (dT)7 tail (Figure 5). Consistent with this
result, ScDna2 helicase activity unwound the DNA substrates
with the 50 oligo (dT)7 or (dT)10 tail poorly (data not shown).
These results confirm that CeDna2 can utilize short 50 ssDNA
tails for cleavage or unwinding, whereas ScDna2 cannot.
The influence of an RNA segment in a chimeric
RNA–DNA flap on endonuclease activity
of CeDna2
We investigated the effect of a terminal RNA segment in a
chimeric RNA–DNA on the endonuclease activity of CeDna2.
Such RNA–DNA structures are likely to be present in a flap
generated by displacement DNA synthesis catalyzed by pol d
during Okazaki fragment extension. For this purpose, the
cleavage of two different 25 nt flap substrates by CeDna2
were examined; one of the substrates contained a chimeric
12 nt oligo (U) and 13 nt oligo (dT) flap and the other a
25 nt oligo (dT) flap (Figure 6A). The presence of the
50 terminal RNA segment in the flap substrate slightly inhib-
ited endonucleolytic cleavage by CeDna2 at all concentrations
of Mg2+ tested (Figure 6A and B). The reduction of the cleav-
age efficiency with the 50 terminal RNA flap was very low and
might as well be within the experimental error. This contrasts
with the observation that endonuclease activity of ScDna2 is
stimulated by the presence of a terminal RNA segment in a
chimeric RNA–DNA flap (17). The cleavage of the RNA–
DNA chimeric flap resulted in the generation of cleavage
products of 14 nt or longer in length (Figure 6A, lanes 6–
8), indicating that CeDna2 does not degrade the oligoribonuc-
leotide. Thus, the endonuclease activity of CeDna2 is specific
for ssDNA, like ScDna2 (17).
Influence of CeRPA on enzymatic activities of CeDna2
To determine whether RPA can stimulate CeDna2, recombin-
ant CeRPA was prepared as described above. Although our
preparations of CeRPA lacked the small subunit, we found that
it binds to ssDNA one-third as efficiently as hRPA or ScRPA
(data not shown). Despite this, we used these preparations
to examine the effect of CeRPA on the enzymatic activities
associated with CeDna2. We first checked whether CeRPA
stimulates DNA unwinding activity of HF-CeDna2D320A.
In preliminary experiments, we found that CeRPA neither
stimulated nor inhibited unwinding of duplex DNA by
CeDna2 in the absence of exogenous salt (data not shown),

substrates containing varying lengths of the 50-tail were as shown at the top of
the Figure. The asterisk indicates the 32P-labeled end. (A) Reaction mixtures
(20 ml) containing 15 fmol of the substrate and 0.2 ng of HF-CeDna2 were
incubated at 37C for 10 min in the presence of two different levels (0.5 or
5 mM) of MgCl2. The length (nt) of the 5
0 tail (dT)n in the substrate used in each
lane is as indicated in the Figure. The cleavage products were then analyzed on a
20% polyacrylamide gel, and M denotes the molecular size markers. The
numbers (in nt) shown on the left and right of the Figure indicate the size of
the markers. (B) Reaction mixtures (20 ml) containing 15 fmol of each substrate
with a differing length (5–10 nt) of the 50 (dT) tail and 5 mM MgCl2 were
incubated at 37C for 10 min in the presence of indicated amounts of CeDna2.
The products were analyzed on a low-resolution polyacrylamide gel (10%). The
amount of substrate cleaved was measured with the use of a PhosphorImager
and plotted against the amounts of enzyme used. The symbols for the length of
50 dT tail are as shown. (C) The same experiment as (B) was repeated with
HF-CeDna2D320A in place of wild-type HF-CeDna2, and 2 mM of ATP was
added to support unwinding of the substrate. The unwound products were
analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated as described in
Figure 3A. For (B and C), the experiments were repeated three times, and
the average of the three experiments is shown with error bars as indicated.

but stimulated the helicase activity of CeDna2 in the presence
of a physiological salt concentration (125 mM NaCl). In the
presence of this salt condition, the rates of CeDna2-catalyzed
unwinding reaction and cleavage of a flap-structured substrate
were examined in the presence of increasing levels (0–50 ng)
of CeRPA (Figure 7). Both the unwinding (Figure 7A and B)
and the endonuclease (Figure 7C and D) activities were stimu-
lated by increasing levels of CeRPA.
Stimulation of Dna2 by RPA is species-specific
Preliminary studies indicated that ScDna2 was stimulated by
ScRPA, but inhibited by human RPA, suggesting that there
may be a species-specific interaction between RPA and Dna2.
In order to examine this possibility, RPAs from human and
yeast were also isolated as shown in Figure 1B. The influence
of the three different RPA complexes (from human, yeast and
C.elegans) on endonuclease activity of ScDna2 (Figure 8A)
was examined initially. In the absence of RPA, ScDna2 (20 ng)
cleaved 1.8 fmol of the 50 ssDNA tail substrate (Figure 8A,
lane 2) in the presence of 125 mM NaCl in the reaction. It was
noted that ScDna2 endonuclease activity was severely inhib-
ited in the presence of 125 mM NaCl (data not shown). For this
reason, an increased level (20 ng) of ScDna2 enzyme was used
to measure the cleavage. The addition of ScRPA (10 and 50 ng)
markedly stimulated the endonuclease activity of ScDna2 (to a
saturation level) (Figure 8A, lanes 9 and 10). With lower levels
(2 ng) of ScDna2, the addition of 2 and 10 ng of ScRPA
increased substrate cleavage 10- and 40-fold, respectively
(Figure 8A, lanes 12–15). The addition of CeRPA (10 or
50 ng) marginally stimulated (1.5-fold) the ScDna2 endonuc-
lease activity (Figure 8A, lanes 3 and 4). ScDna2 endonuclease
activity was slightly enhanced at lower levels (10 ng), but
inhibited at higher levels (50 ng) of human RPA (Figure 8A,
lanes 6 and 7). RPA from all three species did not contain
detectable nuclease activity (Figure 8A, lanes 5, 8 and 11).
These results demonstrate that ScDna2 endonuclease activity
is stimulated specifically by ScRPA. Additional experiments
were carried out to further establish that the species-specific
effects of RPA applied to CeDna2 as well. As shown in
Figure 8B and C, neither ScRPA nor hRPA stimulated the
CeDna2 endonuclease or helicase activity, whereas CeRPA
markedly stimulated both. From these results, we conclude
that a species-specific protein–protein interaction between
Dna2 and RPA is essential for the stimulation of Dna2 enzym-
atic activities.

DISCUSSION
In this paper, we expressed and purified wild-type and mutant
recombinant CeDna2 and CeRPA proteins and extensively
characterized the enzymatic properties of CeDna2 in an effort
to gain insights into Okazaki fragment maturation of a multi-
cellular organism. The open reading frame (1069 amino acids)
of CeDna2 deduced from the full-length cDNA sequence is
significantly shorter than ScDna2 (1522 amino acids) because
it lacks the 405 amino acid domain present at the N-terminus
of ScDna2. Nevertheless, the essential ATPase (11,12) and
nuclease (13) motifs in ScDna2 are well conserved in
CeDna2 and recombinant CeDna2 possessed robust endonuc-
lease and ATPase activities, like ScDna2 (Figures 2 and 3).
CeDna2 and ScDna2 share many essential features of their
enzymatic properties. Both are ssDNA-specific endonuclease
and ATPase/helicase that act preferentially upon a 50 ssDNA
tail. The helicase activity of both enzymes translocates in the
50 to 30 direction, and does not require the fork-like structure
for unwinding. In contrast, Dna2 from fission yeast, humans
(J.H. Kim, unpublished data) and frogs (21) lacks or contains
very low levels of ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity.
Both endonuclease and helicase activities of Dna2 were
stimulated by RPA derived from the same species. This may
account for our earlier observation that expression of S.pombe
dna2+ failed to rescue the null mutation of S.cerevisiae DNA2

(data not shown). In contrast, other reports showed that the
overproduction of Dna2 from human and X.laevis complemen-
ted the temperature-sensitive growth defect caused by a dna2-1
mutant allele (21,22). This is most likely due to the fact that
human or X.laevis Dna2 enzymes, when overproduced in
yeast, are sufficiently functional without RPA. It is noteworthy
that ScRPA did not inhibit CeDna2 activity and vice versa.
Despite many enzymatic similarities between CeDna2 and
ScDna2, several crucial differences were noted that may
suggest subtle differences in the processing of Okazaki frag-
ments between yeasts and C.elegans (see below).
(i) The specific activities of endonuclease and helicase
activities of CeDna2 were significantly higher (10-
and 20-fold, respectively) than those of ScDna2. The
extent of stimulation of endonuclease and helicase activ-
ities of CeDna2 by CeRPA is far less than that observed
with ScDna2 and ScRPA. This may be due to the fact that
CeDna2 lacks the N-terminal 45 kDa domain, which is
present in ScDna2; this domain was shown previously
to be required for maximal stimulation of ScDna2 by
ScRPA (27). Alternatively, the small subunit of CeRPA,
which is not present in our preparation, is required for the
optimal stimulation of CeDna2.
(ii) The 50 ssDNA preference to the 30 ssDNA tail was more
prominent with CeDna2 than with ScDna2 (40-fold
versus 2-fold) (Figure 3C) (17). CeDna2 acted in a highly
catalytic manner in the absence of RPA, while ScDna2
requires RPA for its catalytic activity (19).
(iii) The levels of Mg2+affected the substrate cleavage pattern
of CeDna2, but hardly affected that of ScDna2. It is not
clear at present how Mg2+ affected the cleavage pattern of
CeDna2. One possibility is that CeDna2 undergoes con-
formations changes depending upon the amounts of Mg2+
bound to the enzyme, which affects the positioning of its
active site with respect to the 50 end of an ssDNA tail.
(iv) The presence of a terminal RNA segment present in a flap
substrate slightly inhibited the endonuclease activity of
CeDna2, unlike ScDna2, which is markedly stimulated
by the terminal RNA. It is worthwhile to mention that the
endonuclease activity of the Archaea Dna2 from the
hyperthermophile Pyrococcus horikoshii is completely
inhibited by the presence of a terminal RNA segment at
the 50 end of flaps (33). This observation raises the
possibility that in C.elegans, primer RNAs are mostly
removed (probably by RNase H) before CeDna2 acts
upon the flap.
(v) CeDna2 efficiently degraded very short (<10 nt) ssDNA
tail, whereas ScDna2 did not (Figure 5). If this property
is critical in vivo, it may reflect that displacement
DNA synthesis by pol d generates mostly short flaps
in C.elegans, thus allowing both Fen1 and Dna2 to pro-
cess the short flaps. According to our findings, the 50 flaps
processed by CeDna2 still have 2–3 nt residues and thus a
subsequent action of Fen1 or other enzymes (such as exoI
or the 30 to 50 proofreading function of pol d) is required to
further process the remaining flaps into ligatable nicks
(34,35).
It is well accepted that ssDNA flaps, if they are not removed,
leads to double-stranded DNA breaks (34,36). Accumulation
of double-strand DNA breaks over a threshold level (>30/yeast
cell) results in cell death (37,38). If this were the case, viability
would depend on the efficient removal of the long flaps. In
budding and fission yeasts, Dna2 is absolutely required for
viability (11). In contrast, CeDna2 is not as essential as
ScDna2 for cell viability. The homozygous dna2 deletion
affected the viability of F1 embryos rather mildly, although
lethal effects were observed in the following generation.
Almost all F1 embryos (dna2 is absent both maternally and
zygotically) hatched and 90% matured to adults. However,
most of the F2 embryos either did not hatch or died at the L1 to
L2 stage (28). Since dna2-deleted adults survive for a certain
period of time, it suggests that the formation of long flaps is
rare in C.elegans. When rare long flaps can not be processed
appropriately due to the absence of functional Dna2, they are
eventually repaired most probably via a double-strand break
repair pathway. This process is likely to introduce deletions
into some essential genes that cause lethality. Alternatively,
the delay in lethality observed with dna2-deleted C.elegans
mutants may be due to the gradual loss of chromosomes that
occurs in the absence of a functional Dna2. This notion would
be in keeping with the finding that the synthesis of telomeres
in dna2 mutants of S.cerevisiae is less efficient than in wild
type (39).
Unlike budding and fission yeasts, Fen1 appears to play an
essential role in metazoan organisms, such as C.elegans and
mice, since its absence leads to embryonic lethality (28–30).
This could be explained if Fen1 is responsible for the pro-
cessing of most flap structures, which is possible only when
short flaps are predominantly formed. The difference in
dependence of yeasts and metazoans on Dna2 and Fen1 for
viability is not incompatible with our previous model in which
processing of Okazaki fragments requires the combined action
of two endonucleases (19). Our in vitro data and in vivo obser-
vations raise the possibility that the processing of Okazaki
fragments in different eukaryotes can vary. We propose that
the degree of importance of Dna2 and Fen1 in each eukaryote
is determined by the extent of displacement DNA synthesis
carried out by pol d during Okazaki fragment synthesis; as the
length of the flap generated by displacement DNA synthesis
increases, viability becomes more dependent on Dna2. We and
others have shown that ScDna2 is required for the processing
of long flaps (19) but not for the processing of short flaps of
Okazaki fragments (36,40). Therefore, it is crucial to deter-
mine the frequency with which long flaps occur and their
average size during Okazaki fragment synthesis in order to
evaluate the in vivo role of Dna2 in eukaryotes.
In order to address this issue, it is essential that an in vitro
DNA replication system is reconstituted. Currently, we have
succeeded in isolating human Dna2 in a soluble form and plan
to investigate its role in supporting the processing of lagging
strand in the reconstituted SV40 DNA replication system.
