ABSTRACT
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was originally
described as a non-histone chromosomal protein
and is required for transcriptional gene silencing
and the formation of heterochromatin. Although it
is localized primarily at pericentric heterochromatin,
a scattered distribution over a large number of
euchromatic loci is also evident. Here, we provide
evidence that Drosophila HP1 is essential for the
maintenance of active transcription of euchromatic
genes functionally involved in cell-cycle progression,
including those required for DNA replication and
mitosis. Depletion of HP1 in proliferating embryonic
cells caused aberrant progression of the cell cycle at
S phase and G2/M phase, linked to aberrant chromo-
some segregation, cytokinesis, and an increase in
apoptosis.ThechromosomaldistributionofAuroraB,
and the level of phosphorylation of histone H3 ser-
ine 10 were also altered in the absence of HP1. Using
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we further
demonstrate that the promoters of a number of cell-
cycle regulator genes are bound to HP1, supporting a
direct role forHP1 in theiractive transcription. Overall,
our data suggest that HP1 is essential for the main-
tenance of cell-cycle progression and the transcrip-
tion of cell-cycle regulatory genes. The results also
support the view that HP1 is a positive regulator of
transcription in euchromatin.
INTRODUCTION
Chromatin in higher eukaryotes is subdivided into different
functional compartments termed heterochromatin and euchro-
matin (1). Heterochromatin differs from euchromatin in its
DNA composition, replication timing, condensation through-
out the cell cycle, and its ability to silence euchromatic genes
placed adjacent to or within its territory, often described as
position-effect-variegation (PEV) (2).
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was the first protein
identified in Drosophila melanogaster as a heterochromatin-
associated protein (3); the corresponding gene has been cloned
from a number of organisms and is highly conserved from
yeast to human (4). Polytene chromosome staining showed
that, in Drosophila, HP1 is distributed mainly in pericentric
heterochromatin, telomeric heterochromatin, the banded small
fourth chromosome (5–8), as well as 200 individual loci
scattered throughout the euchromatic chromosomal arms (5).
The gene encoding HP1 in D.melanogaster, Su(var)2-5, was
isolated as a suppressor of PEV (9–11). The protein contains a
highly conserved motif, the chromo (chromatin organization
modifier) domain, similar to Polycomb (Pc), a repressor
of homeotic genes (12). The association between HP1 and
pericentric heterochromatin is believed to occur via the
chromo domain of HP1 and the N-terminal tail of histone
H3 methylated at lysine 9 (13,14), generated by histone
methyltransferase-Su(var)3-9, a partner of HP1 in pericentric
heterochromatin (15). The C-terminal chromo ‘shadow’
domain of HP1 interacts with other silencing complexes to
suppress local transcriptional activity (15–18). However, stud-
ies of HP1 chromosomal distribution also showed that HP1
does not always co-localize with lysine 9 methylated histone
H3 or Su(var)3-9, especially in euchromatic regions (19–21);
in some cases, HP1 is found directly bound to DNA (22,23).
All these features argue for distinct roles for HP1 in chromatin
and in epigenetic gene regulation.
HP1 is believed to be an essential structural protein protect-
ing the integrity of chromosomes during cell division (8,24).
Swi6, the homolog of HP1 in fission yeast, is dispensable for
survival, but its deletion results in lagging chromosomes dur-
ing anaphase, and a high rate of chromosome loss (25,26).
Mutations of HP1 in D.melanogaster result in late larval leth-
ality, chromosome breakages/loss, telomere fusion and a high
frequency of cells with abnormal anaphase (8,27). Null alleles
of the HP1 functional partner in mice (SUVAR39) also showed
various chromosomal defects (28), supporting a conserved role
for heterochromatin proteins in the regulation of chromosome

dynamics during cell-cycle progression. However, the
mechanism(s) involved remains to be understood.
In this study, we utilized Drosophila embryonic Kc cells
and an RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach to demon-
strate that HP1 plays an important role at S phase and G2/M
phases during the cell cycle. We further show that nearly
one-third of known/predicted cell-cycle regulators require
HP1 to maintain their active transcription. These genes include
MCMs, Orc4, CDC45L, INCENP, Aurora B, CAF1, Bub1,
Bub3 and a few other cell-cycle regulators. ChIP analysis
suggests that HP1 plays a direct role in their transcription.
Therefore, the results of this study provide an alternative
explanation for the specific role of HP1 in the regulation of
chromatin dynamics and in cell-cycle progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
RNAi in Kc cells
Drosophila Kc cells were routinely cultured at 25C in
Schneider Drosophila medium (GIBCO) supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum, 160 mg/ml penicillin, 250 mg/ml strep-
tomycin, and 4 mM L-glutamine. Double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) of HP1 was generated by incubation of single-
stranded RNA in annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate,
30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium acetate) for
3 min at 95C and then placed in a beaker with water at 75C
and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The detailed
procedure of RNAi was carried out according to the estab-
lished protocols (http://dixonlab.biochem.med.umich.edu).
Briefly, Kc cells were seeded in a six-well dish using serum-
free medium at 1 · 106 cells/ml. HP1 dsRNA (5 mg/ml) was
added to the cultured Kc cells. After 60 min at room temper-
ature, 2 ml of medium containing 10% serum was added to
each well and the plates transferred to 25C for up to 8 days.
Western blotting and RT–PCR were carried out using the
extract/total RNA isolated from control and dsRNA-treated
cells on days 2, 6 and 8.
Cell-cycle and apoptosis analysis
The procedure for flow cytometric analysis of Kc cells fol-
lowed that in the manual provided with the BrdU flow kit
(BD PharMingen). The cells were fed with BrdU for 4 h,
then scraped and collected. Fluorescence was measured using
a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Data collection and
analysis were performed using CellQuest software.
Electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Cell extracts (15 mg) were fractionated by 10% SDS–PAGE,
then transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham)
and probed with primary antibodies (CIA9), and secondary
antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated IgG), obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Lab-
oratories. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech) were used for signal detection.
For the analysis of H3 ser10 phosphorylation, we used
whole-cell extracts from 700 000 Kc cells (control and RNAi
at day 8). Western blotting was performed using polyclonal
antibodies against ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 at a dilu-
tion of 1:1000 (Upstate). Kc control cells arrested in mitosis by
incubation in 25 mM colchicine (Sigma) for 24 h were also
analyzed for comparison.
Immunofluorescence
Kc cells were seeded onto polylysine slides, fixed with 4%
formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100 for 5 min. The incubation with primary antibodies was
carried out in blocking solution for 1 h.
For staining of mitotic cells, the cells were permeabilized
using PBST (PBS containing 0.3 % Triton X-100) and stained
with polyclonal antibody against Drosophila Aurora B at
1:200 dilution and monoclonal mouse at anti-b-tubulin
1:300 dilution (Chemicon International) as primary antibod-
ies. Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit coupled with Alexa
488 (1:500) and anti-mouse coupled to Alexa 546 (1:500)
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Images were acquired
using a confocal LSM510 META microscope (Zeiss). Stacks
of images were analyzed using the IMARIS 4.0 program
(Media cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA).
Antibodies
Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies of HP1 (rabbit #192
and #187, 5 mg) and 5 mg of polyclonal anti-HA antibodies
(Sigma) were used in each ChIP reaction. The specificity of the
HP1 polyclonal antibodies was determined using various
approaches, including western blotting assay, immunofluore-
scence staining and immunoprecipitation to pull down HP1
(data not shown). The monoclonal antibody HP1–CIA9 (5)
was used at a dilution of 1:20 in immunoblotting assays.
Microarray analysis and RT–PCR
Total RNA was isolated from control and HP1-depleted Kc
cells at day 8 using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA labeling and
microarray data analysis followed the standard protocol
from Affymetrix. We used ANOVA (P < 0.001) to assess
the expression confidence for each gene.
For RT–PCR analysis, poly(A)+ mRNA was purified with
the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The purified poly(A)+ RNA was
reverse transcribed using the Thermoscript kit (Invitrogen).
The cDNA was then used for PCR amplification for 35 cycles
with gene-specific primers. PCR products were scanned after
electrophoretic separation with a Typhoon Scanner, quantified
using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and
normalized for amplification of the Actin5c transcript. The
sequence of primers used for RT–PCR and ChIP analysis
are provided in the Supplementary Material.
ChIP
ChIP was performed according to Orlando et al. (29) and the
protocol provided by Upstate (www.upstate.com) with some
modifications. In brief, 1–2 · 108 Kc cells were prepared and
fixed in 1% formaldehyde. Nuclei were isolated according
to a standard procedure in Current Protocols (http://www3.
interscience.wiley.com), then resuspended in 1.7 ml of lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and
protease inhibitors) and sonicated using a Branson sonifier
250. Chromatin fractions in the size range 0.2–0.8 kb were
used to perform immunoprecipitation experiments. We used
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 9 2853
5 mg affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (#192 and #182 for
HP1; HA antibody for control) and 1 ml of salmon sperm
DNA/protein-A-agarose (Upstate) pre-cleared chromatin
lysate in each reaction. The mixture was then rotated at
4C overnight and the recovered beads were washed twice
with 1 ml of Low salt buffer (Upstate), once with High salt
buffer (Upstate), once with LiCl buffer (Upstate) and twice
with TE at 4C for 8 min. ChIP DNA was extracted according
to the standard procedures (29).
RESULTS
Depletion of HP1 in Drosophila Kc cells
Various chromosomal defects in the cell cycle have been
observed in embryos or larval tissues of Drosophila HP1
mutants (8,27). However, the presence of maternally loaded
HP1 in embryos and the lethality of HP1 mutants at late larval
stages have so far precluded a systematic study of the role of
HP1 in cell-cycle regulation. Therefore, we used Drosophila
Kc cells, a cell line derived from Drosophila embryos, as
a model system to address this problem. HP1 transcripts
were depleted using an RNAi-based approach (see Materials
and Methods). The reduction in HP1 expression was measured
both by RT–PCR and by western blotting analysis (Figure 1A).
A significant reduction in the HP1 expression was already
evident after 2 days treatment with HP1 dsRNA. Cells at
day 8 showed a reduction in HP1 of 90% (Figure 1A)
and were therefore used in all subsequent experiments.
Cell-cycle progression at S and G2/M phase is
altered in the absence of HP1
The impact of HP1 loss on the cell cycle of Kc cells was
determined using cell-cycle profile analysis of HP1-depleted
and control cells. The percentage of cells in S phase was
determined by BrdU incorporation, and total DNA content
by 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD). The results showed that
the depletion of HP1 (day 8) caused a decrease in S-phase
cells of at least 4-fold, and a 2-fold decrease in G2/M-phase
cells (Figure 1B), although no significant effect was found
at the G1 phase. In addition, depletion of HP1 caused a
greater than 7-fold increase in the number of apoptotic
cells. These results, therefore, confirm that HP1 is an import-
ant regulator during the cell cycle, especially at the S and
G2/M phases.
Cell-cycle regulators require HP1 to maintain their
active transcription
To ask whether the cell-cycle defects were due to changes in
the transcription of genes functionally involved in S phase and
the G2/M phase, we next assessed global changes in gene
transcription following depletion of HP1. Expression profile
analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from both
HP1-depleted Kc cells and control Kc cells, and an Affymetrix
Drosophila chip. For each experiment, we used total RNA
isolated from two independent HP1-depleted and control
samples, and at least two independent experiments were
performed.
The microarray analysis showed that loss of HP1 function in
Kc cells resulted in alterations in transcription of >500
genes: 400 genes were down-regulated and 120 genes
were up-regulated (>1.5-fold, ANOVA). The function of
these genes ranged from cellular enzymes, signal transduction
molecules, and membrane and cell structural proteins, to
nucleic acid-binding proteins and cell-cycle regulators
(Figure 2A). At the chromosomal level, the genes targeted
by HP1 appeared to be distributed along all euchromatic
chromosomal arms (data not shown), supporting a global
role of HP1 in euchromatic gene regulation (20).
Among 60 known/predicted genes associated with DNA
replication function, 15 were down-regulated in the absence
of HP1 (Figure 2B). These included McM2, McM5, McM6 and
CDC45L, which are required for processive DNA replication
and correct chromosome condensation (30–32). Other genes
involved in DNA replication, such as components of the

origin recognition complex (Orc)—Orc4, Caf1, Gnf1,
Dref1, DNA polymerase-g and Tam—were also down-
regulated (Figure 2B). Aurora B and inner centromere
protein (INCENP), known to be required for kinetochore
assembly, chromosome condensation and bipolar chromo-
some attachment during mitosis (33), also showed a
reduction in transcription. A similar loss of transcription
was observed in Bub1 and Bub3 (Figure 2B), encoding
mitotic checkpoint control proteins (34,35). Loss function
of Bub1 has been shown to cause chromatin bridges to
extend between the two separating groups of chromosomes,
and extensive chromosome fragmentation in anaphase
cells (35).
We confirmed the changes in the transcription of cell-cycle
regulators using semi-quantitative RT–PCR, which gave
results consistent with the microarray analysis. In addition,
cell-cycle regulator genes, such as McM3, McM7 and Asp
(abnormal spindle), were also confirmed to be down-
regulated (Figure 2C). Collectively, these results demonstrate
that HP1 is indeed involved in the regulation of transcription
of cell-cycle regulators.
HP1 is required for Aurora B distribution and
histone H3 phosphorylation
INCENP is localized to the centromeric region of chromo-
somes at metaphase and the spindle midzone at anaphase,
which then targets Aurora B, a kinase essential for histone
H3 ser10 phosphorylation, to these sites (36). Loss of function
of both these ‘chromosomal passenger’ proteins causes abnor-
mal chromosomal segregation at metaphase, as well as certain
cytokinesis defects (36,37). The loss of transcription of both
INCENP and Aurora B after depletion of HP1, therefore, raised
the possibility that localization of Aurora B (Figure 3
and data not shown) may be altered. Staining of HP1-
depleted Kc cells with anti-Aurora B antibodies indeed
revealed an altered localization of Aurora B and, in a number
of cases, a complete loss of Aurora B (Figure 3A). Consistent
with the loss function of Aurora B, the spindles in the
metaphase cells were also disorganized, with a large
number of cells showing an altered prometaphase chromo-
some alignment (Figure 3A). Some showed extensive
chromosome fragmentation (Figure 3B), or the presence of
a third spindle pole-like structure as indicated by beta-
tubulin (Figure 3A). At telophase, we observed defective sep-
arating cells with an extra cell envelope-like structure without
nuclei (Figure 3A). Chromatin bridges or lagging chromatids
at telophase were also evident in some cells (Figure 3C);
however, in some cases, localization of Aurora B appeared
not to be affected, arguing that other pathways are possibly
involved.
We next analyzed changes in histone H3 serine 10 phos-
phorylation, since the loss of transcription of INCENP is
known to affect localization of Aurora B (33), which is
essential in the regulation of histone H3 phosphorylation
(36). Total cell extracts from HP1-depleted Kc cells were
analyzed by western blotting (Figure 3D). The results
indeed showed a severalfold reduction in H3 ser10 phos-
phorylation after depletion of HP1, consistent with the func-
tional disruption of INCENP and Aurora B in the absence
of HP1.
HP1 directly targets genes encoding cell-cycle
regulators in euchromatin
To test whether the loss of transcription of genes involved in
DNA replication and mitosis was a direct effect of the loss of
HP1, we performed a ChIP analysis to determine whether HP1
is physically associated with these genes. Chromatin lysates
from formaldehyde-fixed Kc cells were sonicated into small
chromatin fragments (0.2–0.8 kb) and immunoprecipitated
with polyclonal antibodies against Drosophila HP1. As a con-
trol, we used a mock precipitation (beads only) and polyclonal
antibodies against HA. Our ChIP results showed that known
transposable elements distributed in heterochromatin, such as
F-element, TART and 1360 (7,38), were all enriched in HP1
binding (Figure 4), which is also consistent with a previous
study (20).
Using the same ChIP DNA material, we then attempted to
determine whether HP1 was enriched in genes involved in
DNA replication. Primers were designed to cover the promoter
regions of selected genes. The results showed that McM3,
McM5 and Tam were all enriched in HP1 binding (Figure 4).
However, McM7 appeared to be HP1-negative, although its

Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 9 2855
transcription was also affected by the loss of HP1 function.
Genes essential for mitosis, such as Aurora B, were also
HP1-positive (Figure 4). These results demonstrate that these
cell-cycle regulator genes are directly targeted by HP1 in their
promoter regions.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we used microarray and RT–PCR techniques
to demonstrate that transcription of cell-cycle regulators
is misregulated in the absence of HP1. Certain defects in
S phase may be a direct consequence of the loss of transcrip-
tion of DNA replication genes such as McM2, McM5, McM6,
CDC45L, Orc4 and others, since these genes have been func-
tionally implicated in the initiation of DNA replication and/or
the progression of replication forks (39). Depletion or muta-
tion of these genes has been shown to result in DNA damage
(32), the blockage of replication forks (39), increased chromo-
some loss/genome instability, and defective condensation (30).
The reduction in the number of cells in G2/M phase may be
a consequence of the reduction in transcription or functional
disruption of INCENP, Aurora B, Bub1, and Bub3 (34,36).
Chromosome segregation defects, such as chromosome frag-
mentation and chromatin bridges in anaphase/telophase cells,
and certain cytokinesis defects in HP1-depleted cells, mimic
the phenotype of cells with loss function of INCENP, Aurora B
or Bub1 (35–37). The mislocalization of Aurora B in the
absence of HP1 is also consistent with the loss of transcription
and functional disruption of INCENP (37), and the reduction
in Aurora B transcription may be partially responsible for the

as controls.
Figure 4. HP1 is physically associated with genes encoding cell-cycle regu-
lators. Enrichment of HP1 in the genes tested was determined using PCR
amplification of ChIP DNA precipitated with control and anti-HP1 antibodies
(#192 and #187). Primers were designed to cover the promoter region of the
genes (see Supplementary Material). The PCR products from the input (Inp)
DNA are shown in the lane to the left of the gel. 1:300 dilution was used for
genes Aurora B, McM3, Tam, McM5, McM7 and Act5c. 1:1500 dilution used for
F-element, TART and 1360 because of their high copy number in the genome.
The PCR products from the controls (mock beads and anti-HA) and that from
ChIP DNA using anti-HP1 are shown in agarose gels. The names of the in-
dividual gene or heterochromatin repeats analyzed are indicated. PCR ampli-
fication was performed for 35 cycles. The ratio between the intensities of the
PCR products of HP1 ChIP DNA and input DNA is indicated on the right.

observed chromosomal defects, including loss of histone H3
phosphorylation at serine 10.
HP1 is also known to physically interact with certain com-
ponents of replication complexes such as ORCs and MCMs
(30,40,41), with the inner centromere protein INCENP (42) and
the chromatin assembly factor CAF1 (43) promoting delivery
of HP1 to heterochromatin sites (44). Loss of HP1 is, therefore,
expected to cause disruption to such HP1-associated com-
plexes, and will partially contribute to the chromatin/chromo-
somal defects in HP1 mutants (8,27) and HP1-depleted Kc
cells. It is therefore well possible that the loss of transcription
of these cell-cycle regulator genes, and consequent disruption
of HP1 functional complexes or heterochromatin structure, all
contributed to the cell-cycle defects observed.
The ChIP assay supports the hypothesis that the loss of
transcription of cell-cycle regulator genes is a direct effect
of the lack of HP1. Aurora B, McM3, and McM5 were all
bound by HP1 at their promoter regions, although other
cell-cycle regulators, such as McM7, were HP1-negative,
implying that the altered transcription in these genes might
be a secondary effect of the loss of HP1.
A previous study in Drosophila Kc cells (20) employed an
approach based on the ectopic expression of a fusion protein of
HP1 with a prokaryotic DNA adenine methyltransferase and
identified a number of methylated targets in the genome. In
this study, MCM3 and MCM5 were not found to be methyl-
ated, indicating lack of association with HP1. On the other
hand, heterochromatin repeats, such F-element and 1360, were
consistently found to be HP1-enriched both here and in the
previous study. It remains to be determined whether these
discrepancies are due to the different experimental systems
used. However, we note that the previous study was performed
using a cDNA array, while we observe binding of endogenous
HP1 at the promoter of these genes. Similarly, another study
using chromatin immunoprecipitation in larvae also showed
few HP1-positive genes that were not detected in Kc cells by
the Dam ID approach (21).
A large number of genes affected by the loss of
D.melanogaster HP1 in larval tissues (21) seem to be different
from that in embryonic Kc cells. The change in the transcrip-
tion of Aurora B and few cell-cycle regulators reported in
this study is also not found among the HP1-affected genes
at larval stage (21). This may be due to specific role(s) of HP1
in different stages of development. Alternatively, it is also
possible that the impact of HP1 in the transcription of
cell-cycle regulators in proliferating cells is underestimated
when performing the analyses on larval tissues, and thus on
mixed populations of both proliferating and differentiating/
differentiated cells.
HP1 is generally known as a transcriptional repressor, as
supported by several lines of evidence: silencing of a euchro-
matic reporter gene in heterochromatin requires HP1 (10,11),
tethering of HP1 next to a euchromatic reporter gene causes
silencing (45), and the repression of genes within euchromatic
region 31 bound by HP1 is relieved in the absence of HP1 (46).
In contrast, genes in heterochromatin, known as heterochro-
matic genes, such as light and rolled, seem to require HP1
to maintain their active transcription (47,48). The level of
transcription of heterochromatic genes was dramatically
reduced in a mutated HP1 background (47–49). It was there-
fore proposed that HP1 may function as a positive regulator of
transcription of these genes (50,51), although the exact regu-
lation mechanism remains unclear. A study of heat-shock
genes found that HP1 is associated with RNA transcripts in
the coding region, and is also a positive regulator of their
transcription (52,53). The chromatin association of HP1 at
the promoter region of active euchromatic genes demonstrated
from this work and others, and its independence from histone
H3K9 methylation (21), all suggest that mechanism whereby
HP1 modulates transcription of euchromatic genes is poten-
tially distinct from its role in heterochromatin formation.
Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that HP1
plays an essential role in cell-cycle progression, and support
the view that HP1, in addition to its role in heterochromatin,
can act as a positive transcriptional regulator of euchromatic
genes.
