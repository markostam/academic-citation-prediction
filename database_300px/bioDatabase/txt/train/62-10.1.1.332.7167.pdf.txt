The extent of the diversity of marine prokaryotes is not well known, primarily because of poor cultivability.
However, new techniques permit the characterization of such organisms without culturing, via 16S rRNA
sequences obtained directly from biomass. We performed such an analysis by polymerase chain reaction
amplification with universal primers on five oligotrophic open-ocean samples: from 100-m (three samples) and
500-m depths in the western California Current (Pacific Ocean) and from a 10-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean
near Bermuda. Of 61 clones, 90% were in clusters of two or more related marine clones obtained by ourselves
or others. We report 15 clones related to clone SAR 11 found earlier near Bermuda (S. J. Giovannoni, T. B.
Britschgi, C. L. Moyer, and K. G. Field, Nature [London] 345:60-63, 1990), 11 related to marine
cyanobacteria, 9 clustered in a group affiliated with gram-positive bacteria, 9 in an archaeal cluster we recently
described (mostly from the 500-m sample), 4 in a novel 'y-proteobacterial cluster, and 6 in three two-membered
clusters (including other archaea). One clone was related to flavobacteria. Only the cyanobacteria plus one
other clone, related to Roseobacter denitrificans (formerly Erythrobacter longus Ochll4), were within 10%
sequence identity to any previously sequenced cultured organism in a major data base. We never found more
than two occurrences of the same sequence in a sample, although four times we found identical sequences
between samples, two of which were between oceans; one of these sequences was also identical to SAR 11.
Overall, the results point to broadly diverse microbial assemblages, with the common presence of heretofore
phylogenetically undescribed groups.
Prokaryotic organisms are critical components of marine
planktonic ecosystems. Many discoveries about their signif-
icance in marine systems have been made only within the
past 15 years; it is now common knowledge that prokaryotes
are major primary producers (4, 35, 37) and heterotrophic
consumers (1, 8, 9) in most marine waters. However, an
important element missing from our knowledge of these
marine prokaryotes is information about what kinds of
organisms make up the populations. The potential range and
diversity of these populations are immense, with prokaryotic
metabolic and phylogenetic diversity greatly exceeding that
of all the eukaryotes combined. Although it is common for
microbial ecologists to think of most marine bacteria as
aerobic heterotrophs, there are no established "model or-
ganisms" that are known to represent the common types in
the ocean. Still, many of our conceptual models of marine
ecosystems include preconceived notions about what pro-
karyotic processes are occurring and what general kinds of
organisms are present. The only group that we can easily
identify in the sea are the photosynthetic bacteria (largely
cyanobacteria and prochlorophytes), because photosyn-
thetic pigments provide good clues to identification. The
main difficulty with the other organisms is that conventional
identification requires first culturing the organisms, but the
vast majority of marine prokaryotes are not readily cultured
(7, 17, 23).
However, recent advances in molecular-biological tech-
niques permit characterization of naturally occurring non-
cultured organisms via 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing

(30). For over two decades, such sequences have proven
invaluable in the phylogenetic characterization of microor-
ganisms. One of the earliest and most striking results of such
work is the basic split between Archaebacteria and Eubac-
teria (more recently proposed to be renamed as the domains
Archaea and Bacteria, terms we use here [39]). Also, the
sequences have permitted classification of the Bacteria into
11 major divisions (38), any pair of which is comparable in
evolutionary distance to the division between eukaryotic
kingdoms, such as animals and plants. The recent applica-
tion of 16S rRNA sequence analysis work to ecological
studies stems from the realization that one can obtain 16S
rRNA sequences directly from microbial biomass; these
sequences can be compared with each other as well as with
data bases (sequences from cultured organisms) to indicate
what kinds of prokaryotes are present in the natural samples,
whether or not they are culturable (30).
Studies involving the 16S rRNA sequences cloned directly
from biomass have recently been done with marine plank-
ton. The first two reports dealt with one sample collected
from the top few meters of the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda
(3, 13) and one sample from the same depth in the central
Pacific Ocean near Hawaii (33). Together, these authors
sequenced 26 different clones. The Sargasso Sea work
involved amplifying partial 16S rRNA genes by the poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) and then cloning and sequenc-
ing the products; the Pacific Ocean work involved creation
of a complete genomic library in phage X, followed by
screening for 16S rRNA genes and sequencing the positive
clones. Both sets of authors have reported finding and
cloning 16S rRNA genes from organisms belonging to two
major bacterial divisions: the cyanobacteria (more generally,
the prokaryotic oxygenic phototrophs) and the proteobacte-
ria (formerly called the purple bacteria). The nine different

16S rRNA DIVERSITY OF SUBSURFACE MARINE MICROORGANISMS 1295
reported clones within the cyanobacteria are all closely
related to each other and are also closely related to several
cultured marine Synechococcus species (13, 33) as well as to
a cultured marine prochlorophyte (36), forming two closely
related divisions. These authors found that within the pro-
teobacteria at both locations there were a total of seven
different sequences that fell into a cluster within the a
subdivision but were not closely related to those from any
previously cultured organisms; this cluster is referred to as
the SAR 11 cluster, named after one of the first clones found
by Giovannoni et al. (13). Other nonclustered a-proteobac-
terial clones were found at both locations, with one of them,
SAR 83, found to have 93% sequence identity to Roseobac-
ter denitnificans, an aerobic photoheterotroph. There were
also five nonclustered -y-proteobacterial sequences, with two
of them showing 90 to 95% sequence identity toAlteromonas
haloplanktis and Chromatium vinosum, respectively. Addi-
tionally, there were two clones reported by Schmidt et al.
(33) that were proteobacterial and were clustered but whose
sequences did not seem to fall within any of the four known
proteobacterial divisions.
In addition to the sequence analysis, Britschgi and Gio-
vannoni (3) performed hybridization and restriction fragment
length analysis on 51 clones; they reported that 18% were in
the SAR 11 cluster, 18% were in the SAR 83 group, 4% were
in the marine Synechococcus group, a few percent were in
other groups, and 47% were not readily characterized by this
method.
Our study differs from those of the above authors prima-
rily in that we sampled from 100- and 500-m depths in the
northeastern Pacific and from a 10-m depth in the Sargasso
Sea in the vicinity of Bermuda. We used a PCR method
similar to that of Giovannoni et al. (13), although we used
universal PCR primers instead of group-specific ones. Our
results include some strong similarities to previous reports
as well as some surprises. We have recently reported the
occurrence of a novel major group of archaea, somewhat
related to the extreme thermophiles, in the Pacific samples.
Most were from the deeper sample, although some were
from 100 m, near the chlorophyll maximum layer (11).
DeLong (5), who used primers specific for archaea, also
found this archaeal group in coastal surface samples from
near Woods Hole, Mass., and Santa Barbara, Calif. In
addition, he found a distinct second group of archaea,
somewhat related to the methanogens, and reported that in
the samples he examined from the U.S. coast, archaea were
widespread and their rRNA accounted for up to about 4% of
the total prokaryotic rRNA in these samples. He did not find
archaea in a surface sample collected from offshore waters in
the Central Pacific.
Here we report on our remaining clones from the subsur-
face offshore samples. In addition to several related to
proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, we have found members
of the second group of archaea reported by DeLong, several
clones related to gram-positive bacteria, a clone within the
flavobacterium group, and clones that appear to be bacterial
but do not seem to be within any of the 11 known major
bacterial divisions. Few duplicates were found within these
clones, suggesting the lack of any strongly dominant bacteria
in these samples and the likelihood that other novel groups
were present but not detected.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling locations and dates were as follows: northeast-
_rn Pacific Ocean approximately 350 miles (1 mile is 1.609
km) west of San Diego, 21 to 24 April 1989, all from within
3 km of latitude 31°49'N, longitude 124°07'W, and sampling
depths of 100 and 500 m; and Sargasso Sea near Bermuda, 25
September 1989, latitude 32°37'N, longitude 64°57'W, sam-
pling depth of 10 m.
Samples were collected in 30-liter Niskin bottles on a
rosette (General Oceanics, Miami, Fla.). Immediately after
the samples arrived on the ship, they were transferred to
20-liter plastic carboys and filtered under < 1 atm pressure (1
atm is 101.29 kPa) in series through 142-mm-diameter glass
fiber filters (type AE; nominal pore size, ca. 1 ,um; Gelman)
and Durapore filters (pore size, 0.22 ,um; Millipore) held in
stainless steel filter units kept on ice. Filtration volumes
ranged from 60 to 200 liters, with filtration rates of 20 to 40
liters/hr. The filters were immediately frozen, returned to the
laboratory, and stored at -80°C until extraction (within 8
months). DNA extraction and purification were performed
by the method of Fuhrman et al. (10); this consisted basically
of brief immersion of the Durapore filter in near-boiling 1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1.5 min, followed by phenol,
phenol-chloroform, and chloroform extraction.
Amplification, cloning, and sequencing of the partial 16S
rRNA genes were done by the method of Fuhrman et al. (11)
and are described briefly below. The sequences for PCR
primers were 1'T'ITGGATCCTCTAGAACGGGCGGTGTG
TRC and TGAGCTCAAGCTTCAGCMGTCCGCGGTAA
TWC (where R represents A or G, M represents A or C, and
W represents A or T), based on the two most widely spaced
of the three universal primers for direct 16S rRNA sequenc-
ing described by Lane et al. (20), with restriction site-
containing linkers at the 5' ends. PCR with a Perkin-Elmer
Cetus GeneAmp kit was run from an initial 1 ng of DNA
(measured by bisbenzimide fluorometry [31]) under the
following conditions: 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 2
min, and 72°C for 3 min. Negative controls with water
instead of DNA showed no amplification. Products were run
on a low-melting-point agarose gel (SeaKem GTG) and
viewed with ethidium bromide, and the bands at the proper
size range (ca. 920 bases) were cut out, eluted, precipitated
with ethanol, digested with BamHI and HindIII, and cloned
into M13 (26). Clones were sequenced by the dideoxy-chain
termination method (32) with a Sequenase 2 kit (United
States Biochemicals). No screening was used to avoid se-
quencing duplicate copies of the same clone, because no
such screening reliably distinguishes between clones that
vary at only a few bases, and we did not want to lump
together very closely related but different clones. Sequence
data were analyzed phylogenetically by the distance matrix
method (18, 27).
Prokaryotic cells in the original samples (preserved with
1% formaldehyde) were counted by acridine orange epiflu-
orescence (15). Thymidine incorporation was measured by
the method of Fuhrman and Azam (9), with 5 nM added
thymidine and a conversion factor of 2 x 1018 cells produced
per mol of thymidine incorporated. Leucine incorporation
was measured by the method of Simon and Azam (34), with
5 nM added leucine and a conversion factor of 1.5 x 1017
cells produced per mol of leucine incorporated (19). Chloro-
phyll was analyzed fluorometrically from 90% acetone ex-
tracts (16). Particulate organic C and N were measured with
a CHN analyzer after collection (Pacific only) on Whatman
GF/F filters. Temperature and salinity (Bermuda only) were
measured by a conductivity-temperature-depth profiler near
Bermuda and an expendable bathythermograph in the Pa-
cific. Light levels (Bermuda only) were measured with a
submersible light meter.

All clones are identified by a name indicating the source
sample followed by a clone number. The NH clones all came
from the Pacific (sampled from the ship R/V New Horizon),
and these were from station 16 (100-m sample depth, 21 April
1989, 1420 h), 25 (100 m, 23 April 1989, 1958 h), 29 (100 m,
24 April 1989, 1100 h), or 49 (500 m, 27 April 1989, 0900 h).
Thus, the clone identifier NH25-5 indicates that this is the
fifth clone from Pacific station 25 (sampled at a 100-m depth).
The BDA clones were from the site near Bermuda, all from
a 10-m depth.

RESULTS
Hydrographic and basic biological data from sample sites.
The ocean areas studied were generally oligotrophic "blue-
water" regions, as indicated by the low surface chlorophyll
concentration and deep chlorophyll maximum layers (11,
12). The Pacific samples came from two depths, the shal-
lower ones from 100 m (within the chlorophyll maximum
layer near the bottom of the euphotic zone) and the deeper
ones from 500 m (substantially below the euphotic zone).
The temperature profile indicated a shallow mixed layer in
the top 20 m, with moderate stratification extending well
below the 500-m depth (11). Temperatures were 5.5°C at 500
m and 14°C at 100 m. Prokaryote abundance ranged from 1 x
108/liter at 500 m to 8 x 108/liter at 100 m (11). The average
doubling time of heterotrophic prokaryotes at the 100-m
depth was estimated from thymidine and from leucine to be
12.7 + 2.3 and 15.7 + 1.1 days (ranges of two samples from
different days), respectively. Chlorophyll concentrations at
100 m were 0.25 to 0.55 ,ug/liter, with 53 to 64% of this
occurring in particles small enough to pass through a 1-,um
Nuclepore filter, 80 to 83% passing a 3-,um filter, and 92 to
93% passing an 8-,um filter (range of two samples from
different days); this chlorophyll size distribution indicates
that more than half of the chlorophyll was in prokaryote-
sized phytoplankton and most of the rest was in eukaryotic
nanoplankton. Levels of particulate organic C and N at 100
m were 66 + 6.2 and 11.1 ± 1.1 ,ug/liter (range of two
samples from different days), respectively. At the Sargasso
Sea site near Bermuda, physical parameters suggested that
the water was mixed in the top 40 m and moderately
stratified below that. The 10-m (sample depth) temperature
was 26.8°C, and salinity was 36.5%o. Prokaryote abundance
in the Sargasso sample was 4.2 x 108 cells per liter. There
are no chlorophyll measurements from the Bermuda sam-
ples, but the 1% light level was at 99 m, typical of waters
with <0.2 jg of chlorophyll per liter near the surface.
Direct epifluorescence counts indicated that 91% of the
prokaryotes passed through the glass fiber prefilter and were
caught on the Durapore filter, from which we extracted DNA
(measured from the Pacific NH25 sample). This is very close
to what we have found previously in other locations, includ-
ing Bermuda (21, 22). This indicates that about 9% of the
prokaryotes were excluded from our analysis.
Clone insert lengths and sequences. Most of the DNA
inserts in the clones are full length (ca. 862 bases) between
the PCR primers. For the purposes of this study, however,
we usually sequenced only a portion of each clone, about 200
bases located between the equivalent of Escherichia coli
positions 537 and 737 (see Discussion). With some clones
(specified below), only short sequences were available.
Usually this was because of fragmentation during cloning,
but in a few instances the clones were unstable and the 16S
rRNA gene inserts were lost from the vector after the initial
short sequences were read. Most of the fragmentation was
probably due to the forced cloning procedure and the pres-
ence of internal restriction endonuclease sites within some of
the amplified genes.
A large-scale phylogenetic tree, containing all of the
groups we found (but not all the members of each group),
shows that our samples contained many broadly diverse
prokaryotic organisms (Fig. 1). Most of the clones were
bacterial, with the exceptions being the novel archaeal group
reported by Fuhrman et al. (11) and the archaeal clones
NH16-4 and NH25-7, discussed below. Figure 1 includes
several clones that are not within clusters of more than two
sequences, and these come from within the flavobacterial
group as well as the so-called et and y subdivisions of the
proteobacteria. Most of these had less than 85% sequence
identity to any previously sequenced clone or organism in
the rRNA data base project (28) or GenBank (2). However,
one such clone, NH16-3, was 95% similar to clone SAR 83 of
Britschgi and Giovannoni and 90% similar to the photohet-
erotrophic R. denitnificans. Considering all of our results,
most clones are from closely related clusters within our set
of sequences or published marine clone sequences, and
more-detailed information on these groups is shown in the
subsequent figures and tables (see below).
The most common closely related group within our se-
quences includes the SAR 11 cluster previously described by
Giovannoni et al. (Fig. 2). Clones in this group were found in
all samples, including the 500-m depth, but a relatively large
proportion came from the Bermuda sample (Table 1). Within
these clones, we seem to have found two subgroups, or
perhaps separate clusters, showing within-group similarities
near 98% and between-group similarities near 92%. There
were some 100% identical clones (from different samples and
even different oceans) within this group, with four of our
clones being identical to SAR 11 found by Giovannoni et al.
(13). There were two clones related to this cluster that could
not be put onto a tree because the available sequences are
too short and the clones were unstable; these are NH29-7
(158 bases) and NH49-2 (76 bases), which both are affiliated
with the four-membered subgroup including NH29-3 (Fig. 2).
Altogether, we report 15 "new" clones in this group.
The second most common group, shown in Fig. 3, was a
set of 11 very similar sequences closely allied to the cyano-
bacteria (prokaryotic oxygenic phototrophs). These are spe-
cifically related to the marine Synechococcus-prochloro-
phyte group, which includes clones SAR 6, SAR 7, SAR 100,
and SAR 139 of Giovannoni et al. (13) and a newly cultured
marine prochlorophyte, Prochlorococcus maninus (36). We
did not find any 100% identical clones within this group,
although some clones had 98% or more identity. Two clones
in this group that were too short to include on the tree are
NH16-5 (153 bases) and NH16-17 (185 bases). Members of
this cluster were not found at 500 m, and only one clone
came from the sample near Bermuda (Table 1).
One of the most interesting finds was four full-length
clones that were affiliated with the Bacteria but showed low
similarity to any previously sequenced organisms in the
RNA Database Project or GenBank, prompting us to deter-
mine long sequences to investigate their phylogeny. Analysis
revealed that one of them (BDA1-5) appeared to be deeply
branched within the gram-positive high-G+C subdivision
but that the other three (NH49-10, NH16-12, and NH16-16,
which we call marine group A) were somewhat related to
each other and did not appear to be affiliated within any of

(with DNAPARS from PHYLIP version 3.41) did not change
these results. A signature sequence analysis (38) also yielded
a similar result, indicating that BDA1-5 is related to gram-
positive organisms (sometimes the high-G+C division, and
sometimes the low-G+C division), yet the marine group A
clones showed no consistent matches with any single group

branching of BDA1-5 with the gram-positive high-G+C
division was found to be robust by bootstrap analysis (6) in
all of 25 bootstrap trees tested. Although NH16-12 and
NH49-10 branched together in 24 of 25 bootstrap trees, they
branched with NH16-16 in only 21 of 25 trees, and the
branch point position in relation to the other bacterial groups
varied significantly. Therefore, the coherence of marine
group A and its relationship to other bacteria are uncertain
with the sequences we have available.
Because of the novelty of these four sequences, we were
concerned that they may be chimeric artifacts from the PCR
(25). Therefore, we first performed secondary-structure
analysis of the clones, and this showed proper internal base
pairing, inconsistent with chimeric artifacts. However, this
analysis showed a variation of secondary structure among
these clones in the variable region located between E. coli
positions 997 and 1044, leading us to exclude this region from
our phylogenetic analysis because of uncertainty in the
alignments (secondary-structure variations in this region are
not uncommon). Furthermore, we compared distance matri-
ces (with the same sequences as in Fig. 4) separately from
the first and last 200 and 300 bases of the sequences. In such
an analysis, chimeras should change their distance relation-
ships to other sequences, depending on which region is being
analyzed. However, these clones showed no significant
changes, again suggesting that they are not chimeras.
Within these deeply branched clones, we found two sets of
somewhat close relatives. The most interesting was a cluster
of nine clones related to clone BDA1-5 (Table 4). This
cluster was somewhat difficult to investigate because most of
its members had only short (ca. 105-bp) fragments of the
gene inserted into the vector and two of the sequences did
not overlap with the others, thus preventing comparison of
all of them together. One clone from the Pacific (NH25-16)
was identical to BDA1-5 over the available region, and eight
of nine varied from each other at only one or two positions
(Table 4). If the data from these gene fragments are included,

the BDA1-5 cluster is the third most common group among
all the clones, only slightly behind the cyanobacteria (Table
1). This group thus appears to be widespread, being found in
both oceans, but we did not find any members in the 500-m
sample. There also was a single clone, BDA1-7, that showed
97% similarity to clone NH16-12; however, the available
sequence is only 126 bases long (the gene insert was lost
after initial sequencing). This two-member loosely defined
group was also found in both oceans.
The fourth most common cluster in our data was the
archaeal group, consisting of seven clones from the 100- and
500-m samples as reported by Fuhrman et al. (11), plus an
additional two clones too short to include on the tree (the
118-base NH25-15 and the 157-base NH49-11); these two
were unstable, and inserts were lost after our initial sequenc-
ing. These clones cluster with archaeal group I reported by
DeLong (5) (Fig. 5). We also found two sequences that
cluster with group II of DeLong (5) (Fig. 5). Both were from
the 100-m depth in the Pacific. One of these clones (NH25-7)
was unstable and was lost from the vector after our initial
sequencing. Although NH16-4 is stable, it is only a short
fragment (198 bases). Therefore, longer sequences of these
group II clones are not available.

Besides the many-membered clusters described above,
there was one smaller cluster. Within the y subdivision of the
proteobacteria, we found a four-member cluster containing
clones from both oceans and from all depths (10 m to 500 m)
(Fig. 6). Two of these, from different depths at the Pacific
site (500 and 100 m), had identical sequences. This seems to
be a widespread group.
DISCUSSION
The cloning region within the 16S rRNA molecule used in
our study was set by the universal PCR primers to be as
inclusive as possible, so as to avoid excluding any organisms
that might be in our samples. In this, our study differs from
some previous related studies in which PCR was used with
group-specific primers (5, 13). However, the forced cloning
procedure may have caused loss of some groups. We chose
to analyze relatively short sequences from several clones
rather than long sequences from a few clones because this
best matched our prime objective, i.e., to characterize (or
"identify") as many individuals as possible while retaining
the ability to distinguish most organisms from their relatives
and to estimate the approximate relationships among the
clones. The information from the 200 bases we routinely
analyzed is adequate for this purpose at the level of resolu-
tion we are interested in; i.e., if one uses the extensive
Ribosomal RNA Database Project (28) as a guide, virtually
all of the ca. 475 prokaryotic species listed have different
sequences in this region (the few that do not tend to be very
closely related strains or species with <0.5% overall 16S
rRNA sequence differences). However, 200-base sequences
are inadequate to resolve deep phylogenetic relationships,
because the error of the distance estimate increases with
decreasing similarity. Thus, the branching orders on most of
the phylogenetic trees, particularly for distantly related taxa,
are only approximate. Therefore, for the most phylogeneti-
cally interesting of our clones (i.e., the possibly novel major
division shown in Fig. 4), we obtained much longer se-
quences to produce the best tree possible. Even with the
partial analyses, we still sequenced and aligned more than
15,000 bases to obtain the results reported here.
The results begin to indicate the phylogenetic diversity
and generally unknown character of marine microbial assem-
blages. Even though we were not the first to examine such
assemblages this way, we still found some big surprises. In
part, this may be because we were the first to look below the
immediate sea surface. As mentioned above, prior reports of
cloned sequences from surface marine biomass described

some archaea plus bacteria belonging to only 2 of the 11
major bacterial divisions: proteobacteria and cyanobacteria.
However, we also found a group related to the gram-positive
bacteria, a member of the flavobacteria, and clones that
seem to fall outside the previous 11 known bacterial divi-
sions (Fig. 1 and 4; Tables 2 to 4). Given the incredible
diversity among the known 11 major divisions, one wonders
what sort of organisms with perhaps totally unknown prop-
erties these novel clones represent.
There do appear to be some ubiquitous components of
these assemblages, at least in the few samples examined to
date. More than half of our clones were related to clusters
previously found by others using similar methods: cyano-
bacteria/prochlorophytes, the SAR 11 cluster, and the ar-
chaeal clusters. The SAR 11 cluster clones were found in all
samples and depths, further supporting the suggestion that
this cluster is common and widely distributed in the sea. The
cyanobacterium/prochlorophyte clones were found every-
where except at 500 m (Table 1), which is expected because
that depth is too dark to support photosynthesis and because
cyanobacteria are too small to sink at an appreciable rate.
The 10-m sample from near Bermuda had only one cyano-

bacterial clone, and there were many more in the 100-m
Pacific samples (Table 1); this is probably because the
cyanobacteria and prochlorophytes are usually most abun-
dant near the deep chlorophyll maximum layer (29). Our
finding of both clusters of archaea in the oligotrophic open
waters we studied, as well as the observation of these groups
in Atlantic and Pacific U.S. coastal waters by DeLong (5),
suggests that these groups are also very widely distributed.
However, previous probing for archaeal DNA in oligo-
trophic surface waters was negative (5, 14), suggesting that
this group is not always present in substantial numbers, at
least at the surface. We did not find them in the shallow
sample from near Bermuda. Unlike the situation with the
cyanobacteria, we do not yet know the basic physiological
characteristics of either the SAR 11 or the archaeal group,
because there are no known cultures of either. Also, we
could not compare our clones with those of Schmidt et al.
(33), because there is no overlap between our cloned region
and the sequenced portion of their clones.
In a few instances, identical clones were obtained from
different samples; we found this particularly interesting (the
duplicates from within the same sample could be cloned
duplicate PCR copies from the same original gene, which is
not as interesting). We found two pairs of clones (BDA1-1
and BDA1-20, NH16-2 and NH16-11) identical to SAR 11
over the region we sequenced, and we think it particularly
interesting that the NH clones were from the 100-m depth in

16S rRNA DIVERSITY OF SUBSURFACE MARINE MICROORGANISMS 1301
Other identical sequences, within the y subdivision of the
proteobacteria, came from the 100- and 500-m Pacific sam-
ples (Fig. 6), and four identical (but short) sequences within
the BDA1-5 cluster were found among three 100-m Pacific
samples (Table 4). There were also several near matches
(>99% sequence identity) within our samples. These came
from within the SAR 11 and BDA1-5 groups. All these
sequences were checked several times to minimize errors in
reading and transcribing, but we cannot exclude the possi-
bility that some of the differences were due to rare PCR or
M13 replication errors. Also, it is not known whether there
are small differences between different copies of 16S rRNA
genes in marine prokaryotes. Thus, the near-identical sam-
ples (i.e., 1- or 2-base difference) may come from the same
kind of organism.
We were somewhat surprised that the identical matches
were commonly between samples, sometimes from different
oceans, and that matches within a sample were present in
two copies at most (we did not screen to avoid duplication).
This suggests that even the most common prokaryotic types
may not be particularly dominant within their own commu-
nities but are commonly found in distant waters of similar
trophic status. We suspect that the apparent low dominance
is not a result of PCR bias, because such bias seems more
likely to decrease rather than increase the apparent diversity
of a sample. Such a decrease in apparent diversity could
occur because some sequence types have a slightly higher
amplification efficiency than the other sequences, thus in-
creasing their relative proportion in the final PCR product
pool. Still, it is possible for PCR to increase the apparent
diversity of the sample if the dominant sequences have
particularly low amplification efficiency compared with most
of the others. Because of this uncertainty, it is not yet
possible to make firm conclusions about the relative abun-
dance of organisms represented by the sequences. Such
analysis is probably best done by probe hybridization (5, 14).
Our data permit us to test the quantitative relationship
between clone abundance and group abundance by compar-
ing the proportion of clones in the "cyanobacterial" group
with completely independent conventional estimates of the
proportion of "cyanobacterial" cells among the prokary-
otes. In our 100-m Pacific samples, this group constituted
27% (10 of 37) of the total clones. Epifluorescence counts of
small autofluorescent cells, presumably cyanobacteria and
prochlorophytes, yielded counts of 2.7 x 107/liter, which is
only 3% of the total bacterial count of 9 x 108/liter. How-
ever, some cells were probably too dim to count by auto-
fluorescence (4). For a maximum possible estimate, we
assumed that all of the chlorophyll a that passed a 1-,um
Nuclepore filter was in prochlorophytes with 1 to 3 fg of
chlorophyll a per cell (3a). Thus, the approximately 300 ng of
chlorophyll per liter we observed in this size fraction trans-
lates to a maximum of 3 x 108 cells per liter. This estimate is
22% of the total prokaryote cell count, which is somewhat
close to the 27% calculated from clone abundance.
However, this upper estimate is probably too high, be-
cause (i) such a high abundance is above any published
counts from natural samples, with most being below 108 (29),
and (ii) the presence in this size fraction of other, larger cells
such as Synechococcus cells and eukaryotic picoplankton
would contribute substantially to chlorophyll but much less
to the cellular abundance. The conclusion is thus not firm,
i.e., that this group may have been more highly represented
among the clones, by as much as ninefold, than one would
expect from the cellular abundance, but the highest possible
(and unlikely) abundance estimate was within 25% of the
estimate from clone numbers. We venture to guess that the
overrepresentation is probably about three- to sixfold. Pos-
sible explanations for a disproportionately high representa-
tion in clones are (i) that cyanobacteria and prochlorophytes
have more copies of the 16S rRNA gene per cell than do
most of the other prokaryotes present; (ii) that extraction,
amplification, or cloning efficiencies are higher for genes
from these organisms; and (iii) that this group includes
nonpigmented members (although none are known [26a]).
We have drawn the following conclusions. (i) Marine
oligotrophic planktonic prokaryotic assemblages contain
both bacteria and archaea. Among our clones, the bacteria
were most common in the euphotic zone and the archaea
were most common in the 500-m sample below the euphotic
zone, but both were found in both zones. Because only one
deep sample was analyzed, it is not yet appropriate to
generalize about the depth distributions. It must also be
remembered that clone distributions are not the same as
species distributions, with groups such as cyanobacteria
apparently being disproportionately represented among the
clones. Thus, other methods, such as probe hybridizations,
are needed to investigate the quantitative distributions.
(ii) Most of the clones occurred in clusters of two or more
related sequences, with only 6 of 61 being <90% similar to
another clone obtained (by ourselves or others) from seawa-
ter. With the exception of cyanobacteria/prochlorophytes
and R. denitnficans, the marine clusters are generally quite
distant (<90% sequence similarity) from any previously
cultured and sequenced organism in the Ribosomal RNA
Database Project or GenBank. Because relatively few ma-
rine cultured isolates have been sequenced, we do not yet
know whether cultures are generally atypical of marine
bacteria or whether the right cultures have not yet been
examined.
(iii) Among the bacteria, the most common clones were in
the proteobacterial and cyanobacterial groups previously
described by Giovannoni et al. (13) and Schmidt et al. (33).
However, we also found a group related to gram-positive
bacteria, one clone related to flavobacteria, and clones from
novel groups, including those that may represent major
bacterial divisions.
(iv) The distributions of duplicate clones lead to two
conclusions about the diversity of natural oligotrophic ocean
microbial communities. First, duplicate clones within sam-
ples were found six times (including one reported by Fuhr-
man et al. [11]) in 61 clones. We never found three or more
identical clones within a given sample. Although it is obvi-
ously not correct to assume that clone distributions are the
same as species distributions, this result still suggests that
the natural populations we sampled were rather diverse and
were not strongly dominated by a single species. However,
this may be incorrect if the dominant types have particularly
low amplification or cloning efficiencies or small copy num-
bers of the 16S rRNA gene. Second, we often found identical
clones in different samples, and we found them twice from
different oceans. One transoceanic duplicate was also iden-
tical to the SAR 11 clone of Giovannoni et al. (13). The
organisms representing these clones seem to be widely
dispersed in the sea and to exist over a wide temperature
range. We cannot say at this time whether such organisms
have maintained their sequence identity over the millions of
years since the separation of the two oceans by the Isthmus
of Panama or whether they have been more recently trans-
ported by long-distance ocean currents (colder than these
subtropical waters we sampled) or in the ballasts of ships
passing from one ocean to the other. Bear in mind that the
