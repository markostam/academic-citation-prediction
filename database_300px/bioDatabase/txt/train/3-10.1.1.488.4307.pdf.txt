Abstract
The breast- and ovarian-specific tumor suppressor BRCA1 has
been implicated in numerous cellular processes, including
transcription, ubiquitination, and DNA repair. Its tumor
suppression activity is tightly linked to that of BARD1, a
protein that heterodimerizes with BRCA1. It has been
previously shown that BRCA1 binds to DNA, an interesting
functional observation in light of the genetic data linking
BRCA1 to DNA repair pathways. In this work, we reexamine
the DNA-binding properties of BRCA1, comparing them with
the DNA-binding properties of the BRCA1/BARD1 hetero-
dimer. Because nuclear BRCA1 exists as a heterodimer with
BARD1, it is likely that in vitro studies of the heterodimer
will provide a more accurate model of physiologic conditions.
Our results indicate that whereas BARD1 cannot directly
bind DNA, it does enhance DNA binding by BRCA1. This is a
surprising observation as both DNA-binding domains are
distal to the BARD1-interacting RING domain of BRCA1.
Further analysis of the dimerization reveals that the BRCA1/
BARD1 interaction is not limited to the amino-terminal RING
domains of each protein. The carboxyl terminus of BRCA1
contributes significantly to the stability of the heterodimer.
We also show that the presence of BARD1 has a secondary
effect, as autoubiquitination of BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers
additionally enhances the affinity of BRCA1 for DNA. Together,
these data suggest that BRCA1 and BARD1 heterodimerization
is stabilized via domains not previously thought to interact
and that BARD1 acts in both ubiquitination-dependent and
ubiquitination-independent ways to influence the role of
BRCA1 in DNA repair. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(4): 2012-8)
Introduction
Loss of BRCA1 function causes cancer in breast and ovarian
cells, but the BRCA1 protein executes a variety of functions
required for all cell types. These functions include the regulation of
transcription (1–4), homology-directed DNA repair (5–9), control of
cell cycle checkpoints (10–12), and the regulation of centrosomes
(13–17). The roles for BRCA1 in these processes have been deduced
using cell lines that express hypomorphic mutants of BRCA1 but a
mechanistic understanding of how BRCA1 regulates these diverse
functions remains unknown.
The 1,863 amino acid sequence of BRCA1 bears little homology
to other known proteins. Two domains of BRCA1, found at the
amino and carboxyl termini of the protein, are exceptions. The
carboxyl terminus of BRCA1 contains two tandem BRCT repeats
(18). These domains, first identified in BRCA1, are found in many
DNA repair proteins. Recently, they have been shown to bind poly-
peptides in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (19–22). Inter-
estingly, many clinically relevant mutations of BRCA1 disrupt or
delete the BRCT domains (23, 24). At the amino terminus of
BRCA1 is a RING domain. This is a class of zinc finger domains
that has an ubiquitin ligase activity in many different proteins (25).
BRCA1 heterodimerizes with another RING-containing protein,
BARD1, forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase (26–28).
BRCA1 has also been shown to have transcriptional coactivation
function (29–31). Although it would be tempting to attribute its
tumor suppression phenotype to indirect downstream effects of
transcription and/or ubiquitination, that may be only an incom-
plete picture. BRCA1 has also been shown to interact with many
DNA repair proteins (32) as well as DNA lesions themselves. Two
domains of BRCA1 exhibit direct DNA-binding activity. A central
region of BRCA1, encompassing approximately amino acids 452
to 1,079, binds with structure specificity to branched, or cruciform,
DNA (33), whereas the carboxyl-terminal BRCT repeats bind with
specificity to DNA ends (34). This suggests that BRCA1 may play a
direct as well as indirect role in DNA repair and in maintaining
genomic stability.
One defining characteristic of BRCA1 is its cellular localiza-
tion pattern. During S phase, BRCA1 is localized to punctate
nuclear foci (35). Following DNA damage, however, these foci are
disrupted, and BRCA1 is redistributed to foci thought to mark
sites of DNA damage. These damage-dependent foci colocalize
with g-H2AX and DNA repair proteins, including Rad50 and Rad51,
and offer further evidence for a direct role in DNA damage repair
by BRCA1 (36–38). Additional immunofluorescence experiments
have shown that these foci also contain ubiquitin polymers. The
ubiquitin chains in DNA repair foci are linked via ubiquitin lysine 6,
an unusual ubiquitin linkage that has been reported for BRCA1/
BARD1 (28, 39–41). This suggests that the DNA repair and ubiq-
uitination functions are concurrently active and interdependent.
BRCA1 function is tightly linked to its RING-binding partner,
BARD1. BARD1 was identified in a screen for proteins that interact
with the RING domain of BRCA1. Like BRCA1, BARD1 contains
amino-terminal RING domains and a carboxyl-terminal BRCT
repeats (26). Cellular levels of BRCA1 and BARD1 are reciprocally
regulated and studies of BRCA1 complexes have failed to detect
BRCA1 that is not associated with BARD1 (42, 43), suggesting that
BRCA1 exists as an obligate heterodimer with BARD1. Therefore,
the cellular processes in which BRCA1 has been implicated are also
likely to involve BARD1.
Consistent with this, BARD1 mutations show many of the
same phenotypes as BRCA1, including chromosome instability and
defects in homology-directed DNA repair (44–46). In addition to its
involvement in BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination, BARD1 has been
shown to be required for proper localization of BRCA1, both in the
absence of and following DNA damage. Binding to BARD1 masks a

nuclear export signal in BRCA1, making it essential for nuclear
retention of BRCA1. BARD1 is also required for proper localization
of BRCA1 to damaged induced foci. This relationship is reciprocal
as BRCA1 is required for proper localization of BARD1 (47).
These data suggest that BARD1 and BRCA1 act together in a
pathway promoting tumor suppression and that an accurate model
of BRCA1 function must include BARD1. In this article, therefore,
we examine the role BARD1 plays in the direct DNA-binding
activities of BRCA1. Although there have been a number of studies
examining BRCA1 and BARD1 ubiquitination activities, there has
been little biochemical work done with respect to the involvement
of BARD1 in the direct role of BRCA1 in DNA repair.
In the following experiments, we show that BARD1 enhances the
DNA-binding activity of BRCA1, although it itself exhibits no DNA-
binding activity. This enhancement is due to previously unidenti-
fied interactions between BRCA1 and BARD1 downstream of the
RING domain. The presence of BARD1 also provides a secondary
means to stabilize DNA-bound BRCA1 as autoubiquitinated
BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers display an even greater affinity for
DNA than their unubiquitinated counterparts. Taken together,
these data suggest that BARD1 stabilizes BRCA1 at sites of DNA
damage and that the ubiquitination function of the heterodimers
plays an important role in DNA repair.
Materials and Methods
Baculovirus constructs. Baculovirus expressing FLAG-tagged BRCA1,
FLAG-tagged BRCA1 truncations, BARD1, or BARD1 truncations were
constructed using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Full-
length BRCA1 was either 5V or 3V FLAG tagged. BRCA1 truncations were 3V
FLAG tagged, and activities we measured were unaffected by the location of
the tag. BARD1 was untagged. Truncations used in these experiments
include the following: BRCA1 (amino acids 1-1,863), BRCA1 (1-1,527),
BRCA1 (1-1,000), BRCA1 (1-500), DN-BRCA1 (303-1,863), and BARD (1-292).
DNA constructs. Four-stranded Holliday junction DNA was assembled
from the complementary oligonucleotides as follows: HJ1, 5V-CGTTTTGG-
GTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATCCATTGTCTAT-
GACGTCAAGCT; HJ2, 5V-CCGCTACCAGTGATCACCAATGGATTGCTAGGA-

ACGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATCCATTGGTGATCACTGGTAGCGG; HJ4:
5V-GAGCTTGACGTCATAGACAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCC-
GTCTTGTCAATATCGGC.
Oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 95jC for 2 minutes
followed by incubation at 65jC, 37jC, 25jC, and 4jC for 10 minutes each.
Holliday junctions used as gel mobility shift probes were end-labeled with
[32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. DNA junctions
were gel purified by nondenaturing PAGE and eluted in TE buffer.
Protein purification. Hi-5 insect cells were infected with baculovirus
expressing FLAG-tagged BRCA1 or BRCA1 truncations or coinfected with
BRCA1 and BARD1-expressing baculovirus. Cells were lysed 48 to 72 hours
postinfection using a tight-pestled Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were
cleared through centrifugation and proteins were immunoprecipitated using
M2 anti-flag agarose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Proteins were
eluted in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 10 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 15%
glycerol, 0.01% NP40, 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmol/L
benzamidine-HCl, 2 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 0.2 mg/mL FLAG
peptide, and 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme. Protein was quantitated by comparison of
an ovalbumin standard with the intensity of the stained band representing
the expected-length protein on a Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel.
His-BRCA1-398-1097 (BRCA1 CBD) was overexpressed in BL21 cells.
Histidine-tagged BRCA1-CBD was purified from crude bacterial lysate by
chromatography using Ni-NTA matrix. Fractions containing BRCA1-CBD
were pooled and purified using a BioScale S column (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Fractions were eluted in a linear gradient containing buffer A
[10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 3 mmol/L
DTT] and 0.1 mol/L KCl to buffer A plus 1.0 mol/L KCl. Fractions
containing protein were pooled, diluted to buffer A plus 0.1 mol/L KCl, and
purified using a BioScale Q column. Fractions were collected over a linear
gradient of buffer A plus 0.1 mol/L KCl to buffer A plus 1.0 mol/L KCl.
Fractions containing His-BRCA1-CBD were pooled and dialyzed in buffer A
plus 0.1 mol/L KCl.
6His-E1 ubiquitin ligase and 6His-UbcH5c were purified as previously
described (48).
The BRCT region of BRCA1 was purified as previously described (49).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. BRCA1, BRCA1/BARD1 hetero-
dimers, BRCA1 CBD, or BRCT as indicated were incubated with 1 to
5 nmol/L Holliday junction for 25 minutes at 22jC in 7.4 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 60 to 80 mmol/L KCl, 4 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum
albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Complex formation was followed by
electrophoresis on 4% to 12% polyacrylamide gradient Tris-borate EDTA
gels (Invitrogen) and visualization using autoradiography. Results were
quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics Storm phosphorimager, followed
by analysis with ImageQuant. Results were similar in the presence or
absence of 0.2% glutaraldehyde.
Autoubiquitination experiments. BRCA1/BARD1 was immunopurified
from baculovirus-infected cell lysates as described above, but before elution
from the M2 agarose BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers were autoubiquitinated.
Protein-bound beads were washed and resuspended in 0.5 buffer A [10
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol] containing 5
mmol/L MgCl2, 60 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L ATP, 16 nmol/L 6His-E1
ubiquitin ligase, and 0.8 Amol/L 6His-UbcH5c. One half of the BRCA1/
BARD1 bound to M2 agarose was incubated with 0.1 mg/mL bovine
ubiquitin (Sigma Chemical) and one half of the BRCA1/BARD1 was
incubated without ubiquitin for 45 minutes at 37jC. The beads were
washed and protein was eluted as described above.
Results
BARD1 enhances DNA binding by BRCA1. To determine
the effect of BARD1 on BRCA1-dependent DNA binding, we first
purified BRCA1 and BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers. Hi5 insect cells
were infected with baculovirus expressing a FLAG-tagged BRCA1
or coinfected with the FLAG-BRCA1 and an untagged BARD1.
BRCA1 and BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers were immunoaffinity
purified (Fig. 1A). Full-length BRCA1 (200 kDa) and BARD1
(90 kDa) are the major bands present in the purified protein. The
minor bands (50-65 kDa) also present are detected by antibodies
against BRCA1 by immunoblotting (data not shown) and are likely
to be BRCA1 breakdown products. As will be shown below, these
breakdown products are unlikely to bind DNA with significant
affinity.
These purified recombinant proteins were then subjected to
an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). As BRCA1 was pre-
viously shown to bind with structure specificity to four-stranded
Holliday junction DNA, BRCA1 and BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers
were incubated with a 32P-labeled synthetic Holliday junction
(Fig. 1B). As seen in lanes 2 to 5 of Fig. 1B , and consistent with
published results (33), BRCA1-bound probe exhibited a complex
banding pattern in the EMSA. As increasing amounts of BRCA1 were
added, the resulting complex slowed inmigration. Therefore, it is likely
that the protein-DNA complexes contain multiple BRCA1 molecules.
Like BRCA1 alone, BRCA1/BARD1 yielded a complex shift in
the EMSA (Fig. 1B , lanes 7-10). However, BRCA1/BARD1 bound
to the DNA at a lower concentration than BRCA1 alone, indicating
a higher affinity for DNA. Because the heterogeneity of the ob-
served complexes prevented direct calculation of the dissociation
constant, affinity of BRCA1 and BRCA1/BARD1 for DNA was
estimated by comparing the concentration at which 50% of the
BRCA1 DNA-Binding Activity Is Stimulated by BARD1

probe was bound. At 4 nmol/L of BRCA1/BARD1, {50% of the
probe was bound (Fig. 1B , lane 9), whereas a comparable level of
binding was not observed until between 8.5 and 17 nmol/L BRCA1
alone (Fig. 1B , lanes 2-3).
BARD1 does not directly bind DNA. In comparing the EMSA
banding pattern of BRCA1/BARD1 and BRCA1 alone, we observed
that the BRCA1 DNA complexes and the BRCA1/BARD1 DNA
complexes did not comigrate (Fig. 1B , lanes 2-5 versus 7-10). We
interpret this to mean that BARD1 is a component of the DNA-
protein complex, rather than merely facilitating the loading of
BRCA1 onto the DNA. Therefore, we examined whether BARD1
could directly bind DNA.
BARD1 proved to be unstable in the absence of BRCA1 (data not
shown) but was stable when copurified with carboxyl-terminal
truncations of BRCA1. Surprisingly, even a small (336 amino acids)
truncation of BRCA1, which retained the central DNA-binding
domain previously identified, exhibited greatly decreased DNA-
binding activity. BRCA1 amino acids 1 to 1,527, BRCA1 amino acids
1 to 1,000 (Fig. 2A), and BRCA1 at amino acids 1 to 500 (Fig. 2B) all
displayed diminished or undetectable DNA-binding activity.
Coexpressing BARD1 with truncations of BRCA1 allowed BARD1
to be purified in the presence of BRCA1 without DNA-binding
activity. We found that BRCA1 (1-500)/BARD1 heterodimers did
not exhibit DNA-binding activity at these concentrations; thus,
BARD1 does not directly bind DNA at these concentrations.
Therefore, the enhanced DNA-binding activity observed with full-
length BRCA1/BARD1 is due to an effect of BARD1 on BRCA1.
BARD1 interacts with BRCA1 distal to the RING domain. To
answer the question of how BARD1 enhanced the DNA-binding
activity of BRCA1, we further examined the interaction between
BRCA1 and BARD1 and the effect of this interaction on the
DNA-binding domains of BRCA1. Two domains of BRCA1 have
DNA-binding activity. One is a central region of BRCA1 roughly
encompassing amino acids 400 to 1,100 (33). The other is the
carboxyl terminus of BRCA1 (34), which contains tandem BRCT
repeats, a motif found in many DNA damage repair proteins.
The two DNA-binding domains of BRCA1 were separately
expressed and purified from bacteria. When used in an EMSA,
it was determined that the individual DNA-binding domains
have significantly lower affinity for DNA than the full-length
protein (Fig. 3). Although the full-length BRCA1 bound 50% of
the labeled probe between 8.5 and 17 nmol/L, the central DNA-
binding domain and the BRCT region individually bound 50% of
the probe at 900 and 2,000 nmol/L protein, respectively. Together
with the data from Fig. 2A , which show that carboxyl-terminal
truncations of BRCA1 have reduced DNA-binding activity, this
suggests that the two low-affinity DNA-binding domains act in
concert to provide the full-length BRCA1 with high-affinity DNA-
binding activity.
Figure 2. BARD1 does not directly bind DNA. A, BRCA1 at amino acids 1 to
1,000 and BRCA1 at amino acids 1 to 1,527 were expressed and purified as with
the full-length protein. These proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and were
Coomassie stained (left ). 32P-labeled Holliday junction DNA was incubated with
varying amounts of BRCA1 (lanes 2-4 ), BRCA1 at amino acids 1 to 1,000
(lanes 5-7), or BRCA1 at amino acids 1 to 1,527 (lanes 8-10 ) followed by EMSA.
Migration of the free probe is indicated. B, BRCA1 (1-500) and BRCA1
(1-500)/BARD1 heterodimers were purified as with the full-length protein and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie dye. Varying amounts of
BRCA1 (1-500) or BRCA1 (1-500)/BARD1 were tested for DNA binding using
EMSA as above.
Figure 1. BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers bind Holliday junction DNA with higher
affinity than BRCA1 alone. A, FLAG-tagged BRCA1 was coexpressed with
untagged BARD1 in insect cells and immunoaffinity purified via the FLAG tag.
Analysis is shown of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of the purified BRCA1
(lane 1 ) and BRCA1/BARD1 (lane 2 ), and the migration positions of a molecular
weight marker (MWM ) are indicated. B, BRCA1 and BRCA1/BARD1
heterodimers were incubated with 32P-labeled cruciform DNA at the indicated
concentrations followed by EMSA. Migration of the free probe is indicated.

To determine whether BARD1 affected one domain more than
another, we examined the differences in DNA-binding properties
between the two domains. Using unlabeled competitor DNA in an
EMSA, we confirmed that the two DNA-binding domains display
differing specificity for DNA structure, with the central DNA-
binding domain having higher affinity for branched Holliday
junction DNA and the BRCT having higher affinity for DNA ends
(data not shown). This is consistent with previously published
observations (33, 34). The structure specificity of the full-length
BRCA1 reflects the specificity of both domains, and BARD1 does
not significantly change the structure specificity of BRCA1 (data
not shown). Therefore, studies of the relative activities of the
individual DNA-binding domains do not yield significant informa-
tion about how BARD1 enhances the BRCA1 DNA-binding activity.
Because the DNA-binding domains of BRCA1 are distal to the
RING dimerization domain, we hypothesized that BRCA1 and
BARD1 might interact via other domains. BARD1 was identified in
a screen for proteins that interact with the amino-terminal RING
domain of BRCA1, but contact between the two proteins via other
domains has not been described. To determine whether BRCA1
and BARD1 interact downstream of the RING domain, we
coexpressed a FLAG-tagged amino-terminal deletion of BRCA1
(lacking the RING domain) with BARD1. DN-BRCA1/BARD1
complexes were immunoaffinity purified as was done with the
full-length complexes. As with the full-length protein, purified DN-
BRCA1 protein included several degradation products (Fig. 4A).
Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE reveals that DN-BRCA1 contains a
degradation product that comigrates with BARD1. Nevertheless, it
was readily apparent that the DN-BRCA1/BARD1 complexes were
significantly enriched for a BARD1-sized band (Fig. 4A).
To confirm that this band did contain BARD1 and to quantitate
the interaction between DN-BRCA1 and BARD1, 2-fold serial
dilutions of BRCA1/BARD1 (Fig. 4B , lanes 1-4) and DN-BRCA1/
BARD1 (Fig. 4B , lanes 5-8) were immunoblotted for both BRCA1
and BARD1. In Fig. 4B , lanes 1 and 5 contained approximately
equal amounts of BRCA1 full-length and DN-BRCA1, respectively.
Figure 4B (lane 5) also confirms the presence of BARD1 in the
purified DN-BRCA1/BARD1. However, the amount of BARD1 in this
lane is equivalent to the amount of BARD1 present in a 4-fold
dilution of the full-length BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers. The RING-
distal interactions between BRCA1 and BARD1, therefore, have
about one quarter the affinity of the sum of the interactions
between the two proteins. This is consistent with removing a major
interaction domain between the two proteins as would be expected
in eliminating the RING domain of BRCA1.
As a negative control, we tested nonspecific interaction with the
antibody-coupled beads. Untagged BARD1 was expressed alone
in insect cells. Lysates of these cells were then subjected to the
same immunopurification procedure used for purifying BRCA1 and
Figure 4. BRCA1 interacts with BARD1 downstream of the RING domain.
A, a FLAG-tagged amino-terminal truncation of BRCA1 that lacks the RING
domain (DN-BRCA1) was coexpressed with untagged BARD1. Complexes were
immunoaffinity purified via the FLAG tag and subjected to gel electrophoresis
followed by Coomassie staining. B, insect cells were infected with FLAG-BRCA1
and BARD1, FLAG-DN-BRCA1 and BARD1, or BARD1 alone. Complexes
were immunoaffinity purified using anti-FLAG antibody and were subjected to
Western blotting for BRCA1 and BARD1. Samples from each of the three
preparations were serially diluted in 2-fold steps, allowing a determination of
the relative concentrations of the polypeptides in each preparation. A 4-fold
dilution of the BRCA1/BARD1 (lane 3) had approximately equal concentration
of BARD1 as did the highest concentration of DN-BRCA1/BARD1 tested
(lane 5 ). The concentration of BRCA1 in each preparation was approximately
equal. C, the BARD1 content of BRCA1/BARD1 (lane 1) was compared with
BRCA1 (1-1,527)/BARD1 (lane 2). To exclude the possibility that poor
BARD1 expression was responsible for low yields of BARD1 when coexpressed
with the BRCA1(1-1,527), the baculovirus encoding BARD1 expression was
infected into cells at 2-fold (lane 3) and 4-fold (lane 4) higher levels, and the
proteins purified via the epitope-tagged BRCA1 were analyzed by silver-stained
protein gel.
Figure 3. BRCA1 has two low-affinity DNA-binding domains. BRCA1 amino
acids 398 to 1,097 and the BRCT domains of BRCA1 were incubated with
32P-labeled Holliday junction DNA and subjected to EMSA. Migration of the free
probe is indicated.

heterodimers. No BARD1 could be detected in the control purifi-
cation (Fig. 4B , lanes 9-12).
An examination of carboxyl-terminal truncated BRCA1/BARD1
heterodimers revealed that removal of the BRCT domains of
BRCA1 also decreased the amount of BARD1 that copurified with
BRCA1. Full-length BRCA1/BARD1 and BRCA1 (1-1,527)/BARD1
heterodimers were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and were silver stained
(Fig. 4C , lanes 1 and 2). BRCA1 (1-1,527)/BARD1 contained sig-
nificantly less BARD1 than the full-length BRCA1 heterodimers. To
ensure that this was not due to differences in baculovirus titer, we
increased the ratio of infection of BARD1/BRCA1 (1-1,527) virus.
Increasing up to 4-fold the amount of BARD1 baculovirus used for
infection could not drive the copurification of BARD1 at the same
levels as seen with the full-length BRCA1 (Fig. 4C , lanes 3 and 4).
This result suggested that the BRCT of BRCA1 interacts with
BARD1 and offers additional confirmation that there are signifi-
cant interactions between the two proteins exclusive of the RING
domain.
Interactions between BRCA1 and BARD1 distal to the RING
domain are responsible for enhanced DNA binding by BRCA1.
To distinguish whether the RING-dependent or RING-independent
interactions between BRCA1 and BARD1 were responsible for the
enhanced DNA-binding activity of BRCA1, we coexpressed FLAG-
tagged full-length BRCA1 with a truncation of BARD1 containing
the RING domain (amino acids 1-292). Heterodimers were immu-
noaffinity purified as described (Fig. 5A).
The DNA-binding activities of BRCA1, BRCA1/BARD, and
BRCA1/BARD (1-292) were assessed in an EMSA with a four-
stranded Holliday junction DNA probe (Fig. 5B). In Fig. 5C , the
results of Fig. 5B were quantitated using a phosphorimager to
estimate the Kd of BRCA1 for DNA. The complex nature of the shift
prevents direct calculation of the Kd; however, we estimated the Kd
from the amount of BRCA1 at which half of the probe was bound.
From Fig. 5C , we estimated the Kd of BRCA1 alone for DNA to be
f10 nmol/L, the Kd of BRCA1/BARD1 to be f3 nmol/L, and the
Kd of BRCA1/BARD1 (1-292) to bef11 nmol/L. Therefore, BARD1
(1-292) must lack the necessary RING-independent interaction
domains required to enhance DNA binding by BRCA1.
BRCA1/BARD1 autoubiquitination further enhances DNA
binding. The heterodimerization of BRCA1 and BARD1 via their
RING domains forms a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is
capable of autoubiquitination. Although BARD1 enhancement of
BRCA1 DNA-binding activity requires RING-independent interac-
tion between the two proteins, we examined whether the RING-
dependent autoubiquitination of BRCA1/BARD1 might have a
secondary effect on DNA binding.
BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers were autoubiquitinated in vitro by
the following approach. BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers coexpressed
in baculovirus-infected insect cells were immunoaffinity purified
via the FLAG tag on BRCA1. Before elution from the FLAG-tag–
specific agarose beads, the beads were divided in two equal
portions and either autoubiquitinated or subjected to a mock
ubiquitination reaction containing all necessary factors but
ubiquitin. The bound proteins were then purified away from
additional components of the ubiquitination reaction and eluted
from the beads (Fig. 6A).
Quantitation of the autoubiquitinated BRCA1/BARD1 was com-
plicated because the ubiquitinated polypeptides did not migrate
as a single focused band but rather as a ladder. In addition, the
76-amino-acid ubiquitin contributed to the mass of the protein.
Because a single BRCA1/BARD1 preparation was divided equally,
we set the eluted ubiquitinated BRCA1/BARD1 at the same
concentration as the unmodified protein prepared in parallel.
That the concentrations were equivalent was supported by experi-
ments in which these two preparations had equal transcription
activity.4
These ubiquitinated heterodimers were then used in an EMSA
to determine DNA-binding activity. As before, 32P-labeled four-
stranded Holliday junction DNA was used as a probe.
Surprisingly, ubiquitinated BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers (Fig.
6B , lanes 7-10) displayed a higher affinity for DNA than the
unubiquitinated control (Fig. 6B , lanes 2-5). The binding
was quantitated in Fig. 6C . Ubiquitinated heterodimers display
nearly a 3-fold higher affinity for DNA than unubiquitinated
BRCA1/BARD1, binding 50% of the free probe at f0.9 nmol/L.
In comparison, this represents a 12-fold increase over BRCA1
alone (Figs. 1 and 5).

Discussion
Because nuclear BRCA1 is associated with BARD1, we analyzed
the effect that BARD1 had on the DNA-binding properties of
BRCA1. BARD1 and BRCA1 were known to interact via the amino-
terminal RING domains of both proteins (26, 50). The RING
domain is separate from both known DNA-binding domains of
BRCA1, but BARD1 nevertheless had the effect of increasing the
affinity of BRCA1 for DNA. In this study, we found that (a) the two
characterized low-affinity DNA-binding domains of BRCA1 act
synergistically to create high-affinity DNA binding by the full-length
protein. (b) Binding of BRCA1 to BARD1 increased the affinity of
BRCA1 for Holliday junction DNA probe 3-fold. (c) The effect of
BARD1 on BRCA1 affinity for DNA revealed that BARD1 and
BRCA1 make contacts via the carboxyl-terminal 336 amino acid
residues of BRCA1. (d) Autoubiquitination of BRCA1/BARD1
increases DNA-binding activity 3-fold.
Two separate, low-affinity DNA-binding domains of BRCA1 had
been characterized: the central DNA-binding domain encompass-
ing residues 452 to 1,097 and the BRCT domain encompassing
residues 1,641 to 1,863 (33, 34). Although our EMSA methods
differed slightly from those previously published, our observations
regarding the individual DNA-binding domains are consistent
with the previously published results. We found that combining
the two domains in a single BRCA1 protein increased the affinity
for DNA f50-fold. Consistent with this effect of linking the two
DNA-binding domains, the DN-BRCA1 bound to the DNA probe
with similar affinity as full-length BRCA1 alone (data not shown).
Binding to BARD1 contributes an additional 3-fold increase in
DNA binding, and autoubiquitination of BRCA1/BARD1 contrib-
utes another 3-fold increase.
The effect of BARD1 on DNA binding led to the realization that
BRCA1 and BARD1 make contacts outside of the amino terminus.
BARD1 was originally isolated via binding to the BRCA1 amino-
terminal RING domain but it had never been shown that other
domains do not stabilize this heterodimerization (26, 50, 51).
If contacts between BRCA1 and BARD1 were limited to the amino-
terminal 100 amino acids of each protein, then BARD1 would
be predicted to have no effect on BRCA1 DNA-binding activity. The
observed increase in DNA-binding activity could therefore be
explained by two possibilities: One is that BARD1 makes additional
contacts with BRCA1 and the other is that heterodimerization
changes the conformation of the entire protein. Although we have
shown evidence for the first possibility, we cannot rule out the
second.
Our data strongly suggest that the additional interactions between
BRCA1 and BARD1 are within the BRCT domain of BRCA1.
Appropriate relocalization of BRCA1 and BARD1 in cells after DNA
damage depends on both the amino and carboxyl termini of the
proteins (52). Because relocalization correlates with the response
to DNA damage, we suggest that following relocalization to DNA
damage–induced foci, the compound DNA-binding domains stably
associate with the genome. Further, autoubiquitinated BRCA1 has
been detected at these foci (40). This suggests that the increase in
affinity of BRCA1 for DNA upon autoubiquitination, discovered
in this study, is a necessary function for DNA damage response
in vivo .
Structural studies of the interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1
have been limited to the RING domain (50, 51, 53). The recent
discovery of a splice variant of BARD1 that fails to interact with
BRCA1 adds further support to the biological relevance of the
RING-independent interactions between BRCA1 and BARD1. This
splice variant retains both the RING and BRCT domains of BARD1
but lacks a significant central region; thus, the RING domain is not
sufficient for heterodimerization with BRCA1 (54). That this splice
variant fails to interact with BRCA1 suggests that either it lacks the
additional BRCA1 interaction domain or that proper alignment
of the RING and BRCT domains is necessary for proper association
of BRCA1 and BARD1.
The interaction of BARD1 with the BRCA1 BRCT raises
interesting questions about clinically relevant mutations in the
BRCA1 carboxyl terminus. Many of these mutations seem to
disrupt proper folding of BRCA1 (55). We speculate that im-
proper folding of the BRCA1 BRCTs may destabilize binding of
BRCA1 to BARD1, thus inhibiting DNA binding and/or ubiquiti-
nation.
Figure 6. Autoubiquitination of BRCA1/BARD1 further enhances DNA-binding
activity. A, BRCA1/BARD1 autoubiquitinated in vitro (lane 2 ) and a control
reaction lacking ubiquitin (lane 1) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and were silver
stained. B, BRCA1/BARD1 (lanes 2-5) and autoubiquitinated BRCA1/BARD1
(lanes 7-10 ) were incubated with 32P-labeled Holliday junction and analyzed
by EMSA. Migration of free probe is indicated. C, results from (B) for DNA
binding, determined as the percent of free probe bound by the BRCA1/BARD1
complex, were quantitated using a phosphorimager.
BRCA1 DNA-Binding Activity Is Stimulated by BARD1
www.aacrjournals.org 2017 Cancer Res 2006; 66: (4). February 15, 2006
Using recombinantly purified proteins, the interaction between
BRCA1 and BARD1 was characterized in light of the effect of
BARD1 on the DNA-binding properties of BRCA1. Although we
found no evidence of direct DNA binding by BARD1, we did
observe that the presence of BARD1 enhanced DNA binding by
BRCA1. The RING domain interaction of these proteins was not
sufficient for this enhancement; rather, we show that the RING-
independent interactions between BRCA1 and BARD1 are respon-
sible for increasing the affinity of BRCA1 for DNA. The RING
domain interactions of BRCA1 and BARD1 do, however, have a
secondary effect on DNA binding. RING-dependent autoubiquiti-
nation of BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers results in an even higher
affinity of BRCA1 for DNA. Together, the net effect of the presence
of BARD1 is anf12-fold increase in the affinity of BRCA1 for DNA.
We conclude that the ubiquitination function of BRCA1 and
BARD1 is likely to play an important role in DNA damage response
by BRCA1.
