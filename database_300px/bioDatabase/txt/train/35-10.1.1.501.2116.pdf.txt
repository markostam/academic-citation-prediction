Alu insertion polymorphisms (polymorphisms consisting of the presence/absence of an Alu element at a
particular chromosomal location) offer several advantages over other nuclear DNA polymorphisms for human
evolution studies. First, they are typed by rapid, simple, PCR-based assays; second, they are stable
polymorphisms—newly inserted Alu elements rarely undergo deletion; third, the presence of an Alu element
represents identity by descent—the probability that different Alu elements would independently insert into the
exact same chromosomal location is negligible; and fourth, the ancestral state is known with certainty to be the
absence of an Alu element. We report here a study of 8 loci in 1500 individuals from 34 worldwide populations.
African populations exhibit the most between-population differentiation, and the population tree is rooted in
Africa; moreover, the estimated effective time of separation of African versus non-African populations is
137,000 ± 15,000 years ago, in accordance with other genetic data. However, a principal coordinates analysis
indicates that populations from Sahul (Australia and New Guinea) are nearly as close to the hypothetical
ancestor as are African populations, suggesting that there was an early expansion of tropical populations of our
species. An analysis of heterozygosity versus genetic distance suggests that African populations have had a
larger effective population size than non-African populations. Overall, these results support the African origin
of modern humans in that an earlier expansion of the ancestors of African populations is indicated.
The Alu family of short interspersed elements is one
of the most successful mobile genetic elements, hav-
ing arisen to a copy number in excess of 500,000
within primate genomes in the last 65 million years
(for recent reviews, see Okada 1991; Schmid and
Maraia 1992; Deininger and Batzer 1993, 1995). Alu
repeats are thought to be ancestrally derived from
the 7SL RNA gene and mobilize through an RNA
polymerase III-derived transcript in a process
termed retroposition. Each Alu sequence is ∼300bp
in length; therefore, Alu repeats comprise ∼5% of
the human genome.
Alu sequences can be divided into different sub-
families or clades of related elements based on com-
monly shared diagnostic mutations. Here, we use
the new standardized nomenclature to refer to vari-
ous Alu subfamilies (Batzer et al. 1996a). Two of the
most recently formed subfamilies of Alu elements
within the human genome have been termed Ya5
and Ya8 (Batzer et al. 1990; Batzer and Deininger
1991). Members of the Ya8 Alu subfamily are char-
acterized by all five of the Ya5 diagnostic mutations,
as well as three additional diagnostic mutations. Be-

cause both the Ya5 and Ya8 Alu subfamilies share a
number of diagnostic mutations we refer to this lin-
eage collectively as Ya5/8 (Batzer et al. 1996b). The
Ya5/8 Alu subfamily lineage is comprised of 500–
2000 elements that are restricted to the human ge-
nome (Arcot et al. 1996), although a few Ya5 Alu
family members have been found in chimpanzees
(for review, see Deininger and Batzer 1995). In par-
allel, a second subfamily that is an independent de-
rivative of the Y lineage of Alu sequences, termed
Yb8, has also expanded to ∼500 copies within the
human genome (Batzer et al. 1995, 1996a).
Some Ya5/8 and Yb8 Alu elements have retro-
posed so recently that they are polymorphic for
presence/absence at a specific location within the
human genome (Batzer and Deininger 1991; Batzer
et al. 1991, 1995; Kass et al. 1994; Hammer 1995).
The distribution of these elements varies in different
human population groups (Batzer and Deininger
1991; Batzer et al. 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996b; Perna et
al. 1992; Kass et al. 1994; Hammer 1995). These
polymorphic Ya5/8 and Yb8 Alu insertions serve as
a unique set of nuclear DNA markers for the study of
human evolution, as they are stable polymorphisms
that are identical by descent. In addition, the ances-
tral state of each Alu insertion is known, facilitating
accurate rooting of population networks (Batzer et
al. 1994).
Previously, we have reported on 4 Alu insertion
polymorphisms in 16 worldwide populations; here,
we analyze the distribution of eight polymorphic
Alu insertions in a survey of 1500 individuals from
34 worldwide population groups. Our results indi-
cate that these polymorphic Alu insertions have an
African origin, although populations from Sahul
(Australia and New Guinea) are also close to the
hypothetical ancestral population, possibly indicat-
ing an early expansion of human populations in the
tropics. Using a model specific for Alu insertion
polymorphisms, we estimate that the effective sepa-
ration time between African and non-African popu-
lations was relatively recent, in accordance with es-
timates from other genetic data. We also find that
African populations probably have had a larger ef-
fective population size than non-African populations;
overall, our results are in agreement with an earlier
expansion of populations in Africa, which corre-
sponds to an African origin of modern humans.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Population Statistics
An average of 1500 individuals from 34 worldwide
populations (Fig. 1) were typed for each of the 8 Alu
insertion polymorphisms (Table 1). The allele fre-
quencies and sample sizes for each population are
shown in Table 2. All loci were polymorphic in all
populations, with the exception of D1 in Nigerians,
FXIIIB in CAR Pygmies, and A25 in the Moluccans,
which were all fixed for the absence of the Alu ele-
ment (Table 2). Significant departures from Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium expectations were observed
for 10 of 269 comparisons. Because ∼13 compari-
sons would be expected to be significant at the 5%
level by chance alone and because none of the sig-
nificant departures cluster by locus or by popula-
tion, we consider these to represent normal statisti-
cal fluctuations. The probabilities of these x2 outli-
ers range from Pr = 0.04 to Pr = 0.003.
The average heterozygosity for each locus was
substantial, with several values approaching the
theoretical maximum heterozygosity of 0.5 for a bi-
allelic locus (Table 1a). Although we expected that
heterozygosity would be high, because these loci
were ascertained on the basis that they were known
to be polymorphic, an analysis of the distribution of
allele frequencies at loci ascertained in a similar
manner indicates that ascertainment bias alone
does not completely account for the observed fre-
quency spectrum; the distributions also contain in-
formation on the demographic history of human
populations (Sherry et al. 1997).
The Gst values (a measure of the amount of sub-
population differentiation) were also substantial
(Table 1a), and were statistically significant for each
locus by a x2 contingency analysis (not shown), in-
dicating that there are significant differences in the
frequency of the Alu element across these human
populations at each of these eight loci. The average
Gst value was 0.128, comparable to other studies of
nuclear DNA polymorphisms in human popula-
tions (Nei and Roychoudhury 1982; Jorde et al.
1995), and means that ∼13% of the total variance in
allele frequency differences at these eight loci is
found between populations and 87% is found
within populations.
For comparing patterns of variation among
populations, we grouped the 34 populations into 6
geographic regions, consisting of Africa, Europe,
Western Asia, Southeast Asia, Sahul (Australia and
New Guinea), and the Americas (Table 1b). The av-
erage heterozygosity for each region was substan-
tial, ranging from a low of 0.308 in Sahul to a high
of 0.414 in Western Asia (Table 1b). The Gst value
was calculated for the differentiation among the
subpopulations within each region and was greatest
in Africa (Table 1b). With respect to these loci, Af-

rican populations show the most between-
population diversity of any geographic region of the
world, although it should be kept in mind that this
finding is based on just eight loci.
Population Relationships
We used both tree reconstruction and principal co-
ordinates (PC) analysis to investigate population re-
lationships. Tree reconstruction methods depict
population relationships as a series of bifurcations,
which are commonly interpreted as representing
population splits; however, it is important to realize
that clusters of populations in such trees could arise
from migration instead of from shared ancestry. A
neighbor-joining tree depicting the population re-
lationships (Fig. 2) shows some concordance with
geography. All of the African populations cluster to-
gether, as do the Sahulian and the European popu-
lations. The Southeast Asian and American popula-
tions are intermingled in one cluster. This may re-
flect inadequate sampling of populations from the
Americas in this study, as a more extensive study of
5 of these loci in 24 native American populations
does show more clustering of native American
populations separate from Southeast Asian popula-
tions (Novick et al. 1997). The Western Asian popu-
lations are not clustered together on the tree, which
could reflect either genetic contributions from both
eastern Asia and Europe to these geographically in-
termediate populations, or an inability to accurately
resolve population relationships with just eight loci.
To root the tree, we included a hypothetical an-
cestral population in which the frequency of the Alu
element at each locus was set to zero. The root of the
tree is within the cluster of African populations (Fig.
2), in agreement with an analysis of other gene fre-
quency data that used the chimpanzee as an out-
group (Nei and Takezaki 1996). Apparently the Alu
insert frequencies in African populations have un-
dergone the least amount of change from the ances-
tral state. Assuming that allele frequency change at

these loci occurs primarily by drift, which in turn is
influenced by population size, this suggests that Af-
rican and non-African populations have a different
demographic history. One possible scenario in-
volves an early expansion of the ancestors of African
populations, thereby ‘‘freezing’’ allele frequencies
when they are more similar to the root, followed by
a later expansion of the ancestors of non-African
populations, when allele frequencies would have
drifted farther from the root. Alternatively, non-
African populations may have been derived from
African populations by a bottleneck event, which
would have accelerated drift in the non-African
populations.
Bootstrap resampling (Felsenstein 1985) was
used to assess the strength of support of the data for
the branching structure of the tree. A total of 500
bootstrap replications were performed, of which
52% placed the root as shown (Fig. 2). An additional
12% of the bootstrap replications placed the root
somewhere else within the cluster of African popu-
lations, which would still be consistent with an Af-
rican origin. The bootstrap values for various other
clusters in the tree ranged from 26% to 58% (Fig. 2).
None of these values reach statistical significance,
which is not surprising with just eight loci; how-
ever, the bootstrap is known to underestimate the
true level of statistical support (Sitnikova et al.
1995); hence, there may be more support for the
clusters in the tree than the bootstrap values alone
would indicate. Overall, these results are concor-
dant with numerous other genetic polymorphisms
that appear to have their source in Africa and/or
indicate an early, separate expansion of African
populations (Stoneking 1993; Bowcock et al. 1994;
Goldstein et al. 1995; Armour et al. 1996; Tishkoff et
al. 1996) and that have been taken as evidence for
an African origin of our species.
A PC analysis (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994) of the
allele frequencies at the eight polymorphic Alu in-
sertion loci was also performed (Fig. 3). The first two
coordinates, which provide the most information
for a two-dimensional depiction of population rela-
tionships, account for 73% of the variance in the

data. The same relationships that were evident in
the neighbor-joining tree (Fig. 2) are also present
here (Fig. 3); namely, geographic clusters of African
and European populations are evident, whereas the
New World populations are intermingled with the
Southeast Asian populations. Two Sahulian popula-
tions cluster together in the analysis while the third
is intermingled with the more dispersed Western
Asian populations. Furthermore, the spread of
populations within each geographic cluster is quali-
tatively similar to the Gst results (Table 1b); African,
Southeast Asian, and Western Asian populations
have the highest Gst values and exhibit the greatest
spread. However, whereas the ancestral population
in the tree (lacking the Alu element at each locus) is
closest to the African populations, the African and
Sahulian populations appear to be equally close to
the ancestral population in the PC plot. This is be-
cause African populations are most similar to the
ancestral population in the first PC, but Sahulian
populations are most similar in the second PC.
A previous PC analysis of a subset of these data
(Batzer et al. 1994) by Harpending et al. (1996) also
found African and Sahulian populations to be clos-
est to the root. Harpending et al. suggest this indi-
cates an earlier expansion of the ancestors of tropi-
cal populations, followed by a later expansion of the
ancestors of more peripheral populations such as

Europeans, Asians, and Amerindians. However, be-
cause the African and Sahulian populations are clos-
est to the root along different principal coordinates,
which are orthogonal, African and Sahulian popu-
lations resemble the root in different ways. One way
this situation could arise is if the earliest division of
human populations was into a western (African)
and eastern (Sahulian) component, with indepen-
dent expansions following a period of separation.
Most genetic data do not link African and Sa-
hulian populations (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994), pos-
sibly because the ancestral state for most genetic
data is unknown. One notable exception is an
analysis of human and chimpanzee restriction frag-
ment length polymorphisms, which identified the
most probable ancestral allelic states and demon-
strated that African and Sahulian populations had
the highest frequencies of ancestral alleles (Moun-
tain and Cavalli-Sforza 1994). Analyses of morpho-
logical variation in skulls (Howells 1973) and teeth
(Stringer et al. 1997) also associate African and Sa-
hulian populations, although this is thought to re-
flect selection acting in similar ways on these tropi-
cal populations (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994). Analyses
of additional genetic loci for which the ancestral
state is known are needed to verify this preliminary
association of tropical populations based on Alu in-
sertion polymorphisms.
Estimated Effective Separation Time of African vs.
Non-African Populations
An estimate of the time of separation of African and
non-African populations can be obtained from the
amount of genetic distance that has accumulated
between them, assuming that this genetic distance
has accumulated in the absence of any further mi-
gration. For human populations this is a dubious
assumption at best, and it is not clear what meaning
one should attach to ‘‘separation times’’ between
human populations. Nevertheless, separation times
between African and non-African populations have
been estimated from various types of genetic data
(Nei and Roychoudhury 1982; Bowcock et al. 1994;
Goldstein et al. 1995; Armour et al. 1996; Knight et
al. 1996; Tishkoff et al. 1996), and our purpose in
doing so here is to see whether the Alu insertion
polymorphisms are concordant with other nuclear
DNA loci. Because we are not attaching any specific
meaning to the actual estimated separation time be-
tween African and non-African populations, we will
henceforth refer to this as the effective separation
time, to emphasize that this would be a true sepa-
ration time only if African and non-African popula-
tions had remained completely isolated after this
time. We used the model of Tachida and Iizuka
(1993), in which the effective separation time is a
function of Nei’s genetic distance (estimated for an
Alu subfamily), the time when the Alu subfamily
began expanding from a single master copy (tb), and
the time when Alu subfamily expansion ended (te).
For the Ya5/8 Alu subfamily, we used Tachida and
Iizuka’s estimate (1993) of tb = 4.3 million years ago,
and we assumed that te = 0 (i.e., this subfamily is
still expanding) because recent insertion events
have been observed (for review, see Deininger and
Batzer 1995). The genetic distance estimate must in-
clude both polymorphic and monomorphic loci
(i.e., loci for which the Alu element is present on
every chromosome) of the Alu subfamily, as an es-
timate of genetic distance based solely on polymor-
Figure 2 Neighbor-joining tree of population rela-
tionships. This tree is rooted where a hypothetical an-
cestral population—in which the frequency of the Alu
element at each of the eight loci is set to 0.0—attaches
to the unrooted network. Numbers indicate (in per
cent) the fraction of 500 bootstrap replicates that sup-
ported a particular grouping.

phic loci will be biased (Tachida and Iizuka 1993).
Random screening of human-specific Alu elements
indicates that ∼20% are polymorphic (Arcot et al.
1996); hence, we estimate that for the 8 polymor-
phic loci in our study, we need to include 32 mono-
morphic loci in the genetic distance calculation.
The resulting average genetic distance between Af-
rican and non-African populations is 0.0246, which
from equation 33 of Tachida and Iizuka (1993) cor-
responds to an effective separation time of
137,000 5 15,000 years ago.
The estimate of tb = 4.3 million years to get the
above effective separation time between African and
non-African populations may be too recent, as a few
Ya5/8 elements are known in chimpanzees and go-
rillas, which diverged from humans 4–6 million
years ago. If one uses instead tb = 5 million years,
then the separation time becomes 159,000 years
ago, whereas tb = 6 million years gives a separation
time of 187,000 years ago; these are not substan-
tially different from the above estimate of 137,000
years ago for the effective separation of African and
non-African populations. These
estimates of the effective sepa-
ration time of African and non-
African populations, based spe-
cifically on a model for poly-
morphic Alu insertion loci, are
in good agreement with stud-
ies of other nuclear DNA poly-
morphisms (Nei and Roy-
choudhury 1982; Bowcock et
al. 1994; Goldstein et al. 1995;
Armour et al. 1996; Knight et
al. 1996; Tishkoff et al. 1996).
Thus, we conclude that the Alu
loci do not differ in this respect
from other nuclear loci.
Heterozygosity vs. Distance
from the Centroid and Effective
Population Size
Previous work has demon-
strated that in a structured
population a simple linear rela-
tionship is expected between
the mean heterozygosity of a
population and the genetic dis-
tance of that population from
the centroid (Harpending and
Ward 1982), and empirical
studies have shown this rela-
tionship to hold (Harpending
and Ward 1982; Crawford et al. 1989; McComb et
al. 1995). A plot of heterozygosity versus distance
from the centroid for the 34 populations in this
study (Fig. 4) shows a good fit between the observed
relationship and that predicted by the model, ex-
cept that all of the African populations have a
greater heterozygosity than predicted. In previous
studies of genetic data, populations exhibiting
greater heterozygosity than predicted by the model
were thought to be experiencing higher rates of
gene flow from other populations, which would el-
evate heterozygosity (Harpending and Ward 1982;
Batzer et al. 1996b). However, high rates of gene
flow should also reduce population differentiation,
but the Gst analysis (Table 1b) indicates that African
populations show the largest between-population
differences.
The model outlined above assumes no system-
atic bias in the ascertainment of polymorphic loci.
Previous studies showing elevated heterozygosities
in Europeans because of ascertainment bias should
not conform to this model. However, the Alu inser-

the eight polymorphic Alu insertion loci. The same relative population relation-
ships were observed when the hypothetical ancestral population (consisting of
allele frequencies of zero for the presence of the Alu element at each locus) was
removed from the analysis (data not shown), indicating that the inclusion of
the ancestral population is not distorting the population relationships.

tion loci analyzed here were either derived from the
literature or the genome of an African–American in-
dividual. Therefore the ascertainment bias in these
polymorphisms is minimal and satisfies the as-
sumptions of the model. We think that the most
likely explanation for the elevated heterozygosity in
African populations may be that the model depicted
by the broken line in Figure 4 assumes that all popu-
lations are of the same relative effective size. If Af-
rican populations have been larger than non-
African populations, then the heterozygosity of Af-
rican populations would also be increased
(Relethford and Harpending 1995). We note that
this explanation implies a greater effective popu-
lation size across Africa, as we analyzed a linguisti-
cally and geographically diverse sample of African
populations, all of which deviated from the model
(Fig. 4).
Other groups have previously suggested that
their results could be explained by either an African
origin or a larger African population size (Armour et
al. 1996; Tishkoff et al. 1996); however, our results
provide the first direct evidence in support of the
latter hypothesis. A similar analy-
sis of worldwide craniometric
variation also found an elevated
heterozygosity in African popula-
tions when population sizes were
assumed to be equal (Relethford
and Harpending 1994). This
analysis also showed that the dif-
ference in size between African
and non-African populations
could be estimated by manipulat-
ing the relative population sizes to
give the best fit to the Harpending–
Ward model; we are currently ex-
ploring how best to do this for
the large number of populations
in the present analysis.
Previous studies have found
greater genetic diversity in Afri-
can populations for mitochon-
drial DNA (mtDNA) (Cann et al.
1987; Vigilant et al. 1991), Y-DNA
(Hammer 1995), and nuclear
DNA (Bowcock et al. 1994; Ar-
mour et al. 1996; Tishkoff et al.
1996) and have claimed that such
greater African diversity reflects a
greater antiquity of African popu-
lations and, hence, an African ori-
gin of modern humans. Others
have pointed out that this greater
African diversity could instead reflect a larger effec-
tive size for African populations (Relethford and
Harpending 1995; Rogers and Jorde 1995; Armour et
al. 1996; Harpending et al. 1996; Tishkoff et al.
1996), and this study supports this argument. A
greater genetic diversity in African populations
therefore does not necessarily imply an African ori-
gin of modern humans, but neither does it contra-
dict this, as African populations could have been
both larger than non-African populations and the
source of modern humans. Moreover, Harpending
et al. (1996) have equated the hypothesis of an
African origin of modern humans with a demo-
graphic scenario in which the ancestors of African
populations expanded earlier than the ancestors of
non-African populations. The fact that African
populations are closest to the ancestral condition
for these Alu insertion polymorphisms, and exhibit
a greater effective population size, is in excellent
agreement with this scenario. Analyses of additional
loci for which the ancestral state is known should
continue to prove instructive in understanding hu-
man origins.

line is the expected relationship predicted by the model of Harpending and
Ward (1982), according to the formula hi = H(1 1 ri), where ri is the distance
from the centroid and hi and H are the heterozygosities of population i and
the total population, respectively.

Population Samples
The following previously described populations were studied:
Nigerian (Batzer et al. 1994), Central African Republic (CAR)
Pygmy (Bowcock et al. 1987), Zaire Pygmy (Bowcock et al.
1987), !Kung (Soodyall et al. 1996), Sotho/Tswana (Soodyall et
al. 1996), Nguni (Soodyall et al. 1996), European–American
(Batzer et al. 1996b), Swiss (Batzer et al. 1996b), Breton (Batzer
et al. 1996b), French (Batzer et al. 1996b), French Acadian
(Batzer et al. 1996b), Greek Cypriot (Batzer et al. 1994), Turk-
ish Cypriot (Batzer et al. 1994), Pushtoon (Melton et al. 1995),
Tamil (Melton et al. 1995), Chinese (Melton et al. 1995), Tai-
wanese (Melton et al. 1995), Filipino (Melton et al. 1995),
Malaysian (Melton et al. 1995), Javanese (Melton et al. 1995),
Moluccan (Perna et al. 1992), Nusa Tenggaran (Perna et al.
1992), Australian (Perna et al. 1992), Coastal Papua New
Guinean (PNG) (Perna et al. 1992), Highland Papua New
Guinean (Perna et al. 1992), Alaskan Native (Batzer et al.
1994), Greenland Native (Batzer et al. 1996b), Mvskoke (Weiss
et al. 1993), and Mayan (Weiss et al. 1993). United Arab Emir-
ates (UAE) samples were collected in Dubai. Pakistani samples
were collected from native Pakistani individuals working in
Dubai. Indian–Christian, –Muslim, and –Hindu samples were
collected from Madras in southern India. DNA from Pakistani,
Indian and UAE samples was prepared from blood stains using
an IsoQuick nucleic acid extraction kit (MicroProbe Corpora-
tion, Bothell, WA).
Typing of Alu Insertion Polymorphisms
PCR amplification conditions, genotyping by agarose gel elec-
trophoresis, and primer sequences for all eight loci (TPA25,
PV92, FXIIIB, APO, ACE, D1, A25 and B65) were described
previously (Arcot et al. 1995a,b; Batzer et al. 1996b). The
TPA25, FXIIIB, ACE, and APO loci are also known as PLAT,
F13B, APOAI, and DCPI, respectively. All 8 loci are present in
humans and absent from orthologous positions within the
genomes of (at least) 15 nonhuman primate genomes (Arcot
et al. 1995a,b; Batzer et al. 1996b). The observed numbers of
each genotype for each locus and population are available
upon request from either M. Stoneking or M.A. Batzer.
Data Analysis
Unbiased estimates of heterozygosity (and associated stan-
dard error) and Gst values, corrected for sample size, were
calculated using equations in Nei (1987). The GENDIST pro-
gram in PHYLIP 3.5 (Felsenstein 1993) was used to calculate
Nei’s genetic distance (Nei 1972) between each pair of popu-
lations for the eight polymorphic loci, and the NEIGHBOR
program was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree (Saitou
and Nei 1987) from these genetic distances. Programs in PHY-
LIP 3.5 were also used to perform 500 bootstrap replications of
the tree. Principal coordinate analysis was performed using a
program provided by H. Harpending (Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity, University Park). Population separation times were
estimated using the model of Tachida and Iizuka (1993), as
described in more detail above. The standard error of the
population separation time estimate was computed by jack-
knifing (Sokal and Rohlf 1981) Nei’s distance, and the result-
ing population separation times, over the eight polymorphic
loci. The model of Harpending and Ward (1982) was used to
assess the relative amount of gene flow experienced by each
population. In this model, which utilizes the standardized
variance–covariance (R) matrix of allele frequencies, a simple
linear relationship is expected between the heterozygosity of
each population and the distance of the population from the
centroid (the arithmetic mean of the allele frequencies):
ri = (pi 1 P)
2/(P)(1 1 P), where ri is the distance from the cen-
troid and pi and P are the frequency of the Alu insertion in
population i and in the total population, respectively. The
above equation was used to compute the distance from the
centroid for each locus separately, and these values were then
averaged over the eight loci.
