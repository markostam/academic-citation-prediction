ABSTRACT
Potent PCR inhibitors in blood and soil samples can
cause false negative results from PCR-based clini-
cal and forensic tests. We show that the effect of
these inhibitors is primarily upon Taq DNA polymer-
ase, since mutational alteration of the polymerase
can overcome the inhibition to the extent that no
DNA purification is now required. An N-terminal
deletion (Klentaq1) is some 10–100-fold inhibition
resistant to whole blood compared to full-length,
wild-type (w.t.) Taq, which is strongly inhibited by
0.1–1% blood. Further mutations at codon 708,
both in Klentaq 1 and Taq, confer enhanced resis-
tance to various inhibitors of PCR reactions, includ-
ing whole blood, plasma, hemoglobin, lactoferrin,
serum IgG, soil extracts and humic acid, as well as
high concentrations of intercalating dyes. Blood
PCR inhibitors can predominantly reduce the DNA
extension speed of the w.t. Taq polymerase as com-
pared to the mutant enzymes. Single-copy human
genomic targets are readily amplified from whole
blood or crude soil extract, without pretreatment
to purify the template DNA, and the allowed
increase in dye concentration overcomes fluores-
cence background and quenching in real-time PCR
of blood.
INTRODUCTION
PCR-based tests of blood and soil samples are widely
used for diagnostics and forensic analyses. Of particular
importance are the diagnostic PCR tests for genetic dis-
eases, microbial and viral infections, blood typing or
blood banking, as well as environmental tests and forensic
human DNA identiﬁcation (1–4). The eﬀect of the main
PCR inhibitors in blood and soil, hemoglobin and humic
acid, is primarily associated with inactivation or inhibition
of Taq DNA polymerase. Therefore, various procedures
and DNA extraction kits are being used to purify DNA
prior to PCR. These extra steps are time consuming, may
not completely remove inhibitors or may lead to losses of
target DNA.
Widely used DNA polymerases like Taq DNA polymer-
ase and AmpliTaq Gold, a hot-start version of Taq,can be
completely inhibited in the presence of less than 0.2%
whole human blood (4,5). Some non-Taq DNA poly-
merases, however, such as rTth, Tﬂ, HotTub and Pwo,
can tolerate higher concentrations of blood (5). Various
agents have been reported to reduce the inhibitory eﬀect of
blood on Taq. It was found that an addition of betaine,
bovine serum albumin, the single-stranded DNA-binding
protein of the T4 32 gene, or a cocktail of protease inhib-
itors can partially reduce the blood inhibition and can
allow Taq to work in up to 2% blood, although this
eﬀect could be sample-speciﬁc (4–8).
The inhibitory eﬀect of blood on PCR is not yet well
understood, and it has been proposed to be associated
primarily with inactivation of the DNA polymerase and/
or capturing or degradation of the target DNA and pri-
mers. Several major inhibitors of PCR in human blood
have been characterized, such as hemoglobin, immunoglo-
bulin G and lactoferrin (7–9,11). Protease activity in blood
also could contribute to the reduced eﬃciency of PCR
(5,9–12).
Sensitive and precise PCR detection of microorganisms
in soil is necessary for agricultural purposes, infectious
disease control and bioterrorism-related pathogen tests
(13–16). Direct extraction of total DNA from soil samples
results in a co-extraction of humic acid, known as the
most potent soil inhibitor to PCR (15,16). Humic sub-
stances represent a mixture of partially characterized poly-
phenols that are produced during the decomposition of
organic matter. Taq DNA polymerase is typically inhib-
ited in the presence of less than 1 ng of humic acid in
a PCR reaction. Other inhibitory components in soil
samples include fulvic acid, polysaccarides and metal
ions (16–18). Another soil-born, high-molecular weight

PCR inhibitor was also identiﬁed. It forms a complex with
proteins and may inhibit PCR by an interaction with Taq
DNA polymerase (19). In some cases addition of bovine
serum albumin to PCR can slightly reduce the inhibitory
eﬀect (20–22). A general problem with the soil samples is
inconsistent data due to high variation in the concentra-
tions of the inhibitors, depending on the soil source. This
fact signiﬁcantly complicates the development of standard
DNA puriﬁcation protocols for processing the samples
before PCR.
Various procedures of DNA extraction have been devel-
oped to reduce the inhibitory eﬀect of blood or soil com-
ponents on PCR (1,18,23–32). These pre-treatment steps
are generally time-consuming, labor-intensive and can be
sample-speciﬁc. Moreover, some PCR inhibitors may still
be present even after using DNA extraction kits. For
example, about 14% of the human hepatitis B virus tests
employing blood DNA puriﬁcation kits could be false-
negative (33).
As an alternative to the various DNA puriﬁcation
steps used with blood and soil samples prior to PCR,
we screened for mutants of Taq polymerase that can
overcome the PCR inhibition distinctive for such samples.
We describe and functionally characterize such mutant
enzymes and demonstrate that they can eliminate pre-
PCR treatment steps. In recently reported studies Taq
polymerase was also mutagenized for achieving other
qualities, such as reverse transcriptase activity and ability
to amplify from damaged templates (34–37).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Site-directed mutagenesis
Part of the Klentaq1 gene was ampliﬁed with a C-terminal
primer, RevTaqH, and a second internal primer spanning
the amino acid change of interest. This ampliﬁed product
was puriﬁed and used as a primer in a second ampliﬁca-
tion step in combination with an N-terminal primer, KT1.
The N- and C-terminal primers contained NcoI and
HindIII restriction sites, respectively. This second step
restored the entire Klentaq gene with the desired mutation
in it. The ﬁnal PCR product was then treated with the
restriction nuclease Dpn I, in order to eliminate the w.t.
target and background plasmid template (38). The puri-
ﬁed PCR product was cloned into the NcoI/HindIII sites
of the expression vector pWB254 (39).
An analogous procedure was performed for site-
directed mutagenesis of Taq, using Taq speciﬁc end
primers harboring the EcoRI and BamHI restriction
sites. The restriction nuclease Dpn I was used again for
eliminating the w.t. background in cloning. The ampliﬁed
Taq gene was cloned into the same sites of the pUC18
vector (40). All full-length Taq clones were propagated
and expressed in a Taq-tolerant Escherichia coli strain,
designated as R. coli that was a gift from Clontech.
Enzyme purification
The Klentaq and Taq mutant enzymes were over-
expressed in our host bacterial strains X7029 and
R. coli, respectively, after IPTG induction for 12–14 h.
The Klentaq mutant enzymes were puriﬁed by BioRex
70 and Heparin-agarose chromatography as previously
described, except that the ammonium sulfate precipitation
was eliminated (39). A slightly modiﬁed protocol was uti-
lized for puriﬁcation of the Taq mutant enzymes, where
100mM AmSO4 was used in the BioRex 70 binding step.
All enzymes were puriﬁed to at least 95% homogeneity,
checked by SDS–PAGE.
Blood samples and soil extracts
Whole human blood and plasma were purchased form
Innovative Research and were EDTA or heparin treated
and obtained from the same donor. Whole blood was
kindly provided from Mid-America Transplant Services.
Blood and plasma samples were stored frozen at 758C in
0.5ml aliquots until use. After thawing on ice, they were
mixed through gentle inversion before adding directly to
PCR reactions as the last ingredient. Aliquots were refro-
zen and used up to ﬁve times with no noticeable eﬀect on
the enzyme or PCR performance.
For preparing soil extracts, fresh soil from diﬀerent
sources was suspended in 1 KLA PCR buﬀer in the
ratio 1:10 (w/v), vortexed and heated for 30min at 758C,
followed by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 20min.
The supernatant was used directly in PCR tests as ‘crude
soil extract’ and stored frozen. These type of extracts
typically contained detectable DNA from soil microorgan-
isms and nematodes, as well as enough humic acid to
exhibit a strong inhibitory eﬀect on PCR with added
template.
PCR inhibitors. Human hemoglobin, lactoferrin and IgG
serum fraction were purchased from Sigma. Hemin chlo-
ride and humic acid were purchased from Calbiochem and
Fluka.
PCR amplification
The PCR reaction buﬀer for all the Klentaq mutant
enzymes was KLA35: 50mM Tris, pH 9.2, 16mM
AmSO4, 3.5mM MgCl2 and 0.1% Tween-20. The Taq
mutant enzymes were assayed in a modiﬁed buﬀer,
KLA25, using pH 8.2 and 2.5mM MgCl2. The reactions
shown in Figures 1a, b, d, 2 and 6–8 were supplemented
with 1.3M betaine (Sigma). PCR reactions contained
200 nM each primer, and 200 mM each dNTP. Other
DNA polymerases tested in comparison to the mutant
enzymes were: Plain Taq (New England Biolabs), plain
Taq and FastStart Taq (Roche), JumpStart Taq
(Sigma), Fail-Safe Taq (Epicentre), AmpliTaq Gold and
rTth (Applied Biosystems), Tth, Tli, and Tﬂ (Promega).
Each enzyme was tested at 2U per 50 ml reaction with its
optimal buﬀer, following manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions. Conventional and real-time PCR was performed
in Robocycler-40 (Stratagene) and Opticon 2 (BioRad),
respectively.
The amount of blood or soil extract varied considering
the sample type and inhibitory concentration. Whole
blood (1–10%) was utilized in real-time PCR detection
with varying amounts of SYBR Green I in the range of
1–64. SYBR green I was purchased from Invitrogen

DNA polymerase assay. The eﬀect of blood and soil PCR
inhibitor on the catalytic activity of the Taq mutants and
the w.t. enzyme was assessed by a nucleotide incorpora-
tion assay as described earlier (39), with minor modiﬁca-
tions. The enzymes, 2U each, were incubated for 10min at
708C. with 12 mg activated (partially DNAse I digested)
calf thymus DNA in 50 ml 1 PCR buﬀer, in the pres-
ence of 50 mM each dNTPs, 1 uCi (a-32P) dATP and var-
ious concentrations of each inhibitor (as indicated in
Table 1).
The reactions were stopped by a quick transfer on ice,
and 5 ml aliquots of the samples were dotted on 3mm ﬁlter
paper pre-soaked with 20mM EDTA. The ﬁlters were
washed 3 20min with 5% trichloroacetic acid/1%
sodium pyrophosphate, dried, and exposed to a phosphoi-
mager screen. The dot intensity, reﬂecting the incorpora-
tion rate of the labeled nucleotide into DNA was analyzed
by Quantity One software (Molecular Imager FX,
BioRad).
RESULTS
Screening for blood-resistant (BR) Klentaq1 and Taq
mutant clones
We attempted to obtain mutants of both Taq and
Klentaq1 DNA polymerase with high tolerance to PCR
inhibitors in blood. Klentaq1, a truncated version of Taq
with a N-terminal deletion of 278 amino acids, is an
improved version of the w.t. enzyme, with higher ﬁdelity
and thermostability (41).
In our initial studies of PCR inhibition by blood, we
found that the known Klentaq1 enzyme could amplify
single-copy genomic DNA in the presence of 5–10%
whole blood. This was a rather unexpected result, as the
full-length Taq enzyme is inhibited by 0.1–1% blood (4,5).
To our knowledge, no correlation between the N-terminal
deletion of Taq and the BR feature of the enzyme has been
reported. This ﬁnding encouraged us to try to obtain
mutated versions of Kentaq 1 with even higher resistance
to blood inhibition. We started with testing 40 arbitrary
but functional Klentaq1 clones derived from a library of
the Klentaq1 gene mutagenized at codons 626, 706, 707
and 708 for PCR performance in the presence of 2.5%,
5% or 10% whole human blood. Previously we had
observed mutations at these positions that confer cold-
sensitivity (Cs) to the enzyme, adding a ‘hot-start’ feature
to its PCR performance (39). In addition, our earlier func-
tional analysis of various Klentaq Cs-mutants indicated
that codons 706–708 are of importance for the overall per-
formance of the enzyme. After several screening rounds
we identiﬁed a clone, KT 7, which reproducibly outper-
formed the w.t. Klentaq1, as well as the previously char-
acterized Cs-mutants of Klentaq 1. The sequence analysis
of KT7 revealed an amino acid change at position 708,
E708W, in addition to the E626K and I707L Cs-muta-
tions. To test if this change is solely responsible for the
BR phenotype, we re-introduced the same mutation in the
parental double Cs-mutant of Klentaq1. When challenged
in PCR with increasing blood concentrations, both the
original KT 7 and the newly made triple mutant showed
identical performance. On the other hand, the basic BR of
the double Cs-mutant was the same as the w.t. Klentaq1,
indicating the importance of codon 708 for the selected
phenotype.
Our library did not contain some of the possible codon
changes, so we introduced the remaining ones individually
until we had tested all 19 possible amino-acid variants at
codon 708, starting with the double mutant E626K,
I707L. The functional test of the resultant clones revealed
two mutant alternatives which exhibited even higher tol-
erance to blood and remained functional in at least 20%
whole blood, KT 10 (E708K) and KT 12 (E708L)
Figure 1A shows the performance of KT7, KT 10 and
KT 12 in amplifying an exogenous DNA target in the
presence of 5–20% whole blood. The three mutant
enzymes outperformed the w.t. Klentaq1. Similar results
were obtained with ampliﬁcation of endogenous human
targets, illustrated with KT 10 in Figure 1B. In control
reactions commercial hot-start or plain Taq enzymes
failed to perform in the presence of blood. We also
tested some non-Taq thermostable DNA polymerases,

Tth, rTth, Tﬂ and Tli, for which a high blood tolerance
has been reported (5). In PCR of a human blood gene
target two of these enzymes, rTth and Tﬂ, showed a par-
tial BR but lower PCR eﬃciency in the 5–20% blood
range, as compared to Klentaq 10, while Tth and Tli
were not functional with blood (Figure 1C).
To further verify the functionality of the changes
at residue 708, we also introduced the mutations of the
KT 10 and KT 12 clones into a full-length Taq double
Cs-mutant containing the E626K, I707L changes, which
by itself shows no tolerance to blood. The resultant
enzymes, Taq 10 and Taq 12, remained functional in at
least 10–15% blood. This performance demonstrates a
tolerance to blood concentrations exceeding about
100-fold that of the w.t. Taq. Figure 1D illustrates the
Taq 10 performance matching that of KT 10 in amplify-
ing blood genes from whole blood where w.t. Taq com-
pletely fails. These results demonstrate that the mutations
rendering the Klentaq1 enzyme BR are functional in the
context of the full-length Taq as well. In order to
functionally test the entire spectrum of changes at Taq
codon 708, we performed saturating mutagenesis at that
codon in the full-length double Cs-mutant enzyme as
well. Interestingly, we found that the best amino-acid
substitutions for the BR phenotype of Taq are diﬀerent
than those optimal for Klentaq1. PCR tests of blood
samples with various targets showed the best results
with three new Taq modiﬁcations E708N, E708I and
E708Q (named Taq 3, Taq 4 and Taq 22). Figure 2
illustrates the performance of Taq 22 in a PCR test
where equivalent amounts of either whole blood or
DNA puriﬁed from the same blood were used to amplify
a target from the human CCR5 HIV receptor gene. The
ampliﬁcation with Taq 22 was eﬃcient in both cases,
while w.t. Taq preparations were only functional with
puriﬁed DNA template. Identical results were obtained
with Taq 3, Taq 4 and Klentaq 10 mutants as well (data
not shown). These data suggest that the novel mutant
enzymes can eliminate the need of using DNA puriﬁca-
tion steps from blood prior to PCR.

Tolerance of the BR Taq mutants to SYBRGreen in PCR
Our next step was to test the possibility of using the BR
mutant enzymes in real-time PCR with crude blood sam-
ples. One obstacle we came across was that a standard
qPCR protocol utilizing SYBR Green I does not work
eﬃciently due to a pronounced quenching eﬀect of the
blood on the ﬂuorescent dye. We tried to overcome this
problem by increasing the SYBR Green concentration and
in titration experiments unexpectedly found that the BR
enzyme can tolerate signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of
the ﬂuorescent dye than can the w.t. enzyme. Studies have
shown that SYBR Green I and other ﬂuorescent dyes
used recently in qPCR exhibit some inhibitory eﬀect on
Taq enzyme (42–45). This imposes certain limitations on
the ﬂuorescence level and the sensitivity of the assay.
Commercial Taq enzymes typically can tolerate not
more than 0.5–1 SYBR Green in PCR. As shown in
Figure 3, Fast Start and Jump Start Taqs can be inhibited
even by 0.5 SYBR, showing Ct values of about 20
(yellow curves) vs. Ct of 9–11 with 0.25 and 0.125
SYBR (pink and green curves, respectively). In contrast,
the mutant enzymes remained functional in several times
higher concentration of the dye, up to 2 and 4 for the
Taq 22 and Klentaq 10, in which range no signiﬁcant shift
in the Ct values was observed. Analogous results were
obtained when these mutant enzymes were tested with
other ﬂuorescent dyes, such as EvaGreen, Syto9, Pico,
Toto, Yoyo, LC Green and ethidium bromide (data not
shown), which are alternatives to SYBR Green in qPCR
(42–45).
Real-time PCR of crude blood samples with the BR
Taq mutants
Attempting to overcome the quenching eﬀect of blood on
SYBR Green ﬂuorescence, mentioned above, we per-
formed series qPCR tests with blood and SYBR Green
titration. We found that relatively very high input concen-
trations of SYBR Green are required in order to obtain an
eﬃcient qPCR detection of blood samples. We determined
that the concentrations of the dye required are roughly
proportional to the blood concentrations in the sample.
For example, up to 64 SYBR Green was necessary to
detect ampliﬁcation in up to 10% blood. This ﬁnding
allowed us to develop high SYBR Green concentration
real-time PCR protocols for using Taq 22 and Klentaq
10 in DNA ampliﬁcation from blood samples.
Figure 4 illustrates the application of such protocol with
Taq 22 enzyme, where a DNA target was ampliﬁed in the
presence of 5% and 10% blood with 32 SYBR Green.
The target detection in blood was only possible with the
Taq 22 mutant, while no ampliﬁcation and high ﬂuores-
cence background was observed with w.t. Taq enzymes.

The same fractions and compounds used in Figure 6 were tested for their eﬀect on the catalytic activity of the mutant and w.t. Taq enzymes in a
conventional nucleotide incorporation assay. Each enzyme was incubated with activated (partially digested) calf thymus DNA and 32P-labeled dATP
for 10min at 708C in the presence of ﬁve 2-fold increasing concentrations of each inhibitor. The enzyme activity, represented by the rate of nucleotide
incorporation into DNA, is shown in bold as percent relative to the controls without inhibitor (ﬁrst reactions for each enzyme and inhibitor, referred

In general, the ampliﬁcation eﬃciency in the presence of
blood was reduced, as judged by a shift in the Ct values,
which eﬀect was signiﬁcantly more pronounced with the
w.t. Taqs, especially with the Jump Start Taq, where no Ct
values were available.
Thus, a seemingly paradoxical combination of two PCR
inhibitors—blood and SYBR Green, turned out to work
for the Taq mutants in overcoming the PCR inhibition.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on successful
real-time PCR detection of genes directly in crude samples
containing whole blood at 5% and higher.
High tolerance of the Taq mutants to soil-born
inhibitors of PCR
PCR tests with soil samples can also be very problematic
due to various potent PCR inhibitors present in the soil,
such as humic acid, fulvic acid, polysaccharides and poly-
phenols. We attempted to ﬁnd mutants of Taq polymerase
that provide improved tolerance of such inhibitors. Initial
screening of mutant clones from our mutagenized library
of Klentaq1 gene yielded several clones that were func-
tional in the presence of at least 10 ng humic acid per
50 ul reaction, while the w.t. Taq is inactivated by 1 ng
of the inhibitor. We also screened the mini-libraries of
clones representing the saturating mutagenesis at codon
708 of Taq and Klentaq1 that were used to select the
best BR mutants. Interestingly, the two mutants with
amino-acid changes responsible for high BR, Klentaq 10
and Taq 22, were most capable of overcoming the humic
acid inhibition as well.
Since the humic acid is not the only soil component that
inhibits Taq, we next challenged these enzymes by includ-
ing crude soil extracts in PCR. As shown in Figure 5, the
two mutant enzymes were able to amplify human or bac-
terial gene targets from soil extract concentrations that are
strongly inhibiting the w.t. Taqs. The latter were only eﬃ-
cient after DNA was puriﬁed from the soil sample. The
real-time detection showed a signiﬁcant shift in the Ct
values of w.t. Taq in the lowest soil concentration as com-
pared to the controls, and no Ct values were available with
the higher soil concentrations. On the other hand, the Ct
values with Klentaq 10 remained similar in the whole
range of soil concentrations tested (Figure 5B). Unlike
the blood case, real-time detection of the products ampli-
ﬁed with the mutant enzymes using SYBR Green I was
possible with normal (1) concentration of the dye with-
out changing the protocol.
Resistance of the Taq mutants to major inhibitory

PCR is due to a particular tolerance to some of the known
inhibitory fractions or components found in blood and
soil. In order to minimize possible template related factors
in assessing the tolerance of the enzymes to such inhibi-
tors, we picked a relatively short and easy, 250 bp Lambda
DNA target. In addition, all reactions contained betaine,
a known PCR facilitator and enhancer (4,6,46).
The mutant enzymes and w.t. Taq were tested in PCR
in the presence of serial dilutions of whole human blood
and plasma (obtained from the same donor), as well as
serum IgG fraction, hemoglobin, hemin (a hemoglobin
prosthetic group-containing breakdown product) and lac-
toferrin, for which a PCR inhibitory eﬀect has been
reported (9,11,12). The enzymes were also challenged
with a crude soil extract and humic acid, the major PCR
inhibitor found in soil. The results showed signiﬁcantly
higher resistance of the mutant enzymes as compared to
the w.t. Taq to all inhibitors tested except for the lacto-
ferrin (Figure 6). The mutant enzymes remained func-
tional in all tested concentrations of blood and plasma
(1.5–25%), hemoglobin (0.15–2.5mg/ml), and soil extract
(1–15%), and tolerated the IgG fraction at 25 mg/ml
(Klentaq 10) and 12.5mg/ml (Taq 22), hemin at 3.2 mM,
lactoferrin up to15 mM (Klentaq 10) and 30 mM (Taq 22),
and humic acid at 400 ng/ml (Klentaq 10) or 200 ng/ml
(Taq 22). In general, Klentaq 10 proved to some extent
more resistant to most of those inhibitors relative to Taq
22, consistent with its more robust performance typically
observed with unfractionated blood and soil samples.
On the other hand, the w.t. enzyme showed only a partial
resistance to the IgG fraction (up to 6.25 mg/ml), but
remained fully active in the presence of 30 mM lactoferrin,
matching the tolerance of the mutants to this inhibitor.
The impressive multi-resistance of the mutant enzymes
may well explain their functionality in crude blood and
soil samples. These data also suggest that at least the inhi-
bition by lactoferrin alone could be a limiting factor in
their performance.
Effect of blood and soil inhibitory components on DNA
polymerase activity
Another approach in analyzing Taq enzyme inhibition
was to assess the eﬀect of the blood and soil inhibitory
components on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. To do
so, we performed a nucleotide-incorporation assay, similar
to the one used conventionally for determining DNA
polymerase activity. In this assay the enzyme substrate is
an activated, partially DNAse I digested DNA, where the

enzyme acts mainly in ﬁlling in nicks in DNA and the
DNA extension is limited to a few nucleotides. The
enzyme activity is manifested by the rate of radiolabeled
nucleotide incorporation into DNA. The same blood and
soil-derived inhibitors, tested for their eﬀect on PCR in
Figure 6, were included in this assay. The results, shown in
Table 1, revealed a general inhibition, not selective for the
w.t. Taq, by human plasma, IgG fraction, hemoglobin and
hemin. Remarkably, instead of inhibition, a total stimula-
tion was observed with lactoferrin. At lower concentra-
tions, the plasma, serum IgG and hemoglobin also had a
stimulatory eﬀect on all enzymes, probably due to a gen-
eral enhancement of their activity by the increased protein
concentration. On the other hand, whole blood and soil
extract showed certain predominant inhibitory eﬀect on
the w.t. Taq. Relatively most selective inhibition was
observed with humic acid, where the w.t. enzyme was
most inhibited (bottom row of Table 1). Interestingly,
humic acid present at the lowest concentrations tested
(100–400 ng/ml, tolerated in PCR by Klentaq 10 and
Taq 22) (Figure 6) also had certain stimulatory eﬀect
only on the activity of the mutant enzymes. The reason
for this eﬀect is unclear and remains to be analyzed. Thus,
the main functional advantage for the mutants revealed by
this assay was their higher tolerance to humic acid, and to
some extent to whole blood and soil extract. These results
imply that a more selective eﬀect of hemoglobin, hemin
and serum IgG on the w.t. enzyme should be exerted in the
context of PCR.
Effect of the DNA extension time on PCR efficiency in the
presence of blood and soil inhibitors
As some of the known PCR inhibitors found in blood and
soil did not show a predominant eﬀect on w.t. Taq activity
in the non-PCR assay described above, we looked for
another possible way some of these inhibitors may aﬀect
DNA ampliﬁcation. One can assume that in crude, espe-
cially blood-containing PCR samples, the DNA template
is less available, as it is likely to be bound at least by
proteins. This in turn could aﬀect the speed or processivity
of the enzyme. Or, alternatively, the enzyme speed could
be directly reduced by some inhibitors. Therefore, we
examined whether a longer extension time could compen-
sate for lowed speed. DNA ampliﬁcation of identical sam-
ples, containing varying concentrations of a PCR
inhibitor, was performed in a no ramp-time PCR cycle,
using diﬀering extension times. In the experiment shown
in Figure 7, two human targets were ampliﬁed in duplex
PCR directly from blood (Figure 7A), and puriﬁed human
DNA was used to amplify the same targets in the presence
of a crude soil extract (Figure 7B). We found that dou-
bling the extension time from 2min to 4min, facilitated
the performance of w.t. Taq, which was able to amplify to
some extent the shorter target in 5% blood (the enzyme
was not functional with the longer target). In the soil
samples series, the w.t. enzyme was only functional in
the control reactions containing no soil and a longer
extension time did not help, while the mutant enzymes
shifted their performance to a higher soil concentration

when the extension time was increased. We also observed
some reverse correlation between the target size and
enzyme performance at a given extension time and con-
centration of soil inhibitors. In control reactions lacking
inhibitors both targets were eﬃciently ampliﬁed regardless
of the extension time, which shows that the target ‘diﬃ-
culty’ was not an issue.
We tried to analyze this ﬁnding in more details by using
the ‘easy’ 250-bp Lambda DNA target alone in similar
assay using three diﬀerent extension times of 30, 60 and
120 s. As shown in Figure 8A, with this target we observed
a signiﬁcantly more pronounced eﬀect of the extension
time on the w.t. Taq performance, ranging from no prod-
uct in 2.5% blood to quite eﬃcient ampliﬁcation in 10%
blood at 30 s and 120 s extension time, respectively. In
contrast, the performance of the mutant enzymes in the
entire blood concentration range tested (up to 25%) was
not compromised even with the shortest extension time.
In soil extract (Figure 8B), however, the ampliﬁcation
eﬃciency of both the mutants and the w.t. enzyme did
depend on the extension time. Using the same assay, we
also tested the eﬀect of the two major blood and soil PCR
inhibitors, hemin and humic acid (Figure 8C and D). We
found that none of the enzymes beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from
a longer extension time in the presence of hemin, implying
that this inhibitor may not interfere with the enzyme
speed. On the other hand, the results with humic acids
were similar to those with soil extract, where again with
all enzymes a longer extension time was necessary for per-
formance at higher inhibitor concentration.
The results of these tests shown in Figures 7 and 8 sup-
port the idea that the enzyme speed and/or processivity
can be reduced in the presence of blood and soil, and
demonstrate that the humic acid is responsible for this
eﬀect in soil samples. In the case of PCR in blood,
longer extension time was required for an improved, yet
limited performance of w.t. Taq, more pronounced with
short and easy targets. Unlike the w.t. enzyme, the
mutants remained functional at short extension times,
consistent with a less or not aﬀected DNA elongation
speed.
DISCUSSION
In our attempt to design a better enzyme for clinical and
forensic PCR applications, we obtained mutant forms of
Taq and Klentaq1 DNA polymerases that remain fully
functional in the presence of PCR inhibitors in blood
and soil. The acquired mutant enzymes can endure con-
centrations of whole blood and crude soil extracts highly
exceeding those tolerated by the native Taq enzyme.
In addition, these mutants remain active in higher concen-
trations of SYBR Green and other ﬂuorescent dyes.
Evaluation of the general PCR performance of the
mutant enzymes with puriﬁed DNA template showed
that their sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and ﬁdelity were not com-
promised relative to the w.t. enzyme (data not shown).
We observed that a large fraction of DNA targets tested
beneﬁt from adding betaine to PCR performed with
the mutant enzymes in the presence of blood or soil.
In the case of blood this eﬀect was more pronounced
with endogenous targets and in higher concentration of
blood (usually >5%), especially for the Taq 22 mutant.
Betaine is a known PCR enhancer, which lowers the melt-
ing temperature of DNA by interfering with the hydrogen
bonds of the G:C pairs (46). It can also facilitate PCR in
the presence of some inhibitors (3,4,6). Betaine alone,
however, was not suﬃcient for overcoming the inhibition
of w.t. Taq by high concentrations of blood or soil, as well
as individual PCR inhibitors derived from blood and soil
(Figures 6–8).
The mechanism of action of the PCR inhibitors present
in blood and soil is not yet understood. The overall inhi-
bition of PCR could be a collective result of inactivation
and/or degradation of the enzyme and blocking or degra-
dation of the target DNA and primers. Humic acid, fulvic
acid, polysaccharides and heavy metals are among the
known PCR inhibitors in soil (16,17). The humic acid is
a poorly characterized mixture of polyphenolic com-
pounds (15–17). Among the few identiﬁed major PCR
inhibitors in blood cells are hemoglobin, its derivative
hemin and lactoferrin, both containing iron, as well as
an IgG serum fraction (9–12).
Besides inhibition, another complication of working
with crude blood samples stems from the strong quench-
ing eﬀect of blood on the dye ﬂuorescence in real-time
PCR, most likely caused by the heme. It is also likely
that the blood may cause some modiﬁcation, degradation
or adsorption of the dye. The mutant enzymes were able
to overcome the ﬂuorescence quenching problem, which
can be explained by their tolerance to higher dye concen-
trations, used in our modiﬁed protocol to compensate for
the low ﬂuorescence.
We attempted to determine what functional feature(s)
of the novel Taq mutants provides the advantage of their
better PCR performance in the presence of those inhibi-
tors. The fact that the speciﬁc target and mechanism of
action of the PCR inhibitors is still obscure signiﬁcantly
complicates this issue.
Based on the diﬀerential PCR inhibition test of the
major known PCR inhibitors found in blood and soil
(Figure 6), the functionality of the mutants in whole
blood or plasma can be explained at least by their high
tolerance to hemoglobin/hemin and the serum IgG frac-
tion, exceeding that of the w.t. enzyme about 30 times and
4 times, respectively. We exclude lactoferrin, as the
mutants could not tolerate this inhibitor any better than
the w.t. Taq. The resistance of the mutant enzymes to
PCR inhibition in soil samples can be attributed to their
high tolerance to humic acid (800 ng/ml vs. 24 ng/ml for
the w.t. enzyme). On the other hand, in the DNA poly-
merase assay with the above inhibitors, shown in Table 1,
only the humic acid, and to some extent soil extract and
whole blood, had a predominant eﬀect on the catalytic
activity of the w.t. Taq. The relatively high DNA concen-
tration used in this assay (12 mg/50 ul) might potentially
diminish the overall inhibition, as DNA could outcompete
some inhibitors. The complete lack of inhibition by lacto-
ferrin could be related to such eﬀect of DNA, although it
may also indicate that this inhibitor exerts its eﬀect only in
PCR conditions. Similarly, the lack of selective inhibition

of the w.t. enzyme by IgG, hemoglobin and hemin in this
assay, otherwise observed in DNA ampliﬁcation, suggests
that they should interfere with some PCR-speciﬁc steps.
Consistent with this view, we observed that a longer exten-
sion time in the PCR cycle can partially compensate for
the inhibition of the w.t. enzyme both in blood and soil,
as well as that of the mutant enzymes in soil. A likely
explanation of this observation is that inhibitors in such
samples may aﬀect the enzyme speed and/or processivity.
We found that the humic acid in soil is implicated in
this eﬀect. As mentioned above, humic acid also aﬀects
the enzyme activity in a non-PCR assay in which the

enzyme speed may not be critical. The reported metal
chelating potential and DNA-binding activity of the
humic acid (47,48) may be involved in the inhibition.
The blood component(s) potentially interfering with the
enzyme speed remains to be found. The data shown in
Figure 8C suggest that the major blood inhibitor, hemin,
is not involved in this inhibition aspect. Additional tests
showed that this is true for hemoglobin, lactoferrin and
the IgG serum fraction (data not shown). Since all four
blood inhibitors were tested individually, our data do not
rule out that a combination of them, if not any additional
factor, may aﬀect the enzyme speed, which would explain
the results with whole blood samples shown in Figures 7
and 8A.
The Klentaq 10 mutant typically performed relatively
better than Taq 22 in PCR reactions containing inhibitors.
This most likely stems from the fact that the parental
Klentaq 1 enzyme is more robust than the native Taq,
and, as mentioned earlier, it is more resistant than w.t.
Taq to blood and soil PCR inhibitors, as well as to the
SYBR Green inhibition. When challenged with soil inhib-
itors, Klentaq 10 tolerated more humic acid, while Taq 22
outperformed Klentaq 10 in soil extract, when shorter
extension times and easier-to-amplify targets were used
(Figure 8B and D). A likely reason for this observation
could be that the Klentaq enzyme is generally slower than
the full-length Taq, which is true for their mutant versions
as well (M.K., unpublished observation). This demon-
strates that a higher speed of the enzyme is not suﬃcient
for overcoming PCR inhibition. Consistent with this con-
cept, the beneﬁt for the w.t. Taq from a longer extension
time in soil extract and humic acid was none, or still lim-
ited by the inhibitor concentration, and it was more clear
in blood only with relatively shorter and ‘easy’ exogenous
targets (Figures 7 and 8).
Besides the speed of the enzyme, another potential
target of PCR inhibition could be the enzyme interaction
with the DNA template. It has been proposed that hemin
inhibits the cytoplasmic erythroid DNA polymerase by
binding the enzyme and blocking the enzyme:DNA com-
plex formation (49). We performed serial tests in a ﬁlter
binding assay analogous to the one used in that report,
and found that hemin and humic acid strongly aﬀect the
interaction of Taq polymerase with DNA. In this non-
PCR assay the eﬀect of the two inhibitors on the mutants
and w.t. enzyme was comparable. Interestingly, we repro-
ducibly observed a stronger DNA aﬃnity with the mutant
enzymes (data not included). Further studies could deter-
mine if this feature of the mutants is relevant to their
performance, in particular to their ability to compete
with template bound inhibitors.
In summary, in the scope of the assays used here we
propose that both blood and soil can exhibit at least two
aspects of PCR inhibition: A, aﬀecting the catalytic activ-
ity of DNA polymerase, and B, reducing the enzyme
speed/processivity, either directly or by blocking the
DNA template. In the case of soil PCR, the advantage
of the mutants is apparently conﬁned more in the ﬁrst
aspect, based on their resistance to humic acid inhibition,
while in blood PCR the mutants would outperform the
w.t. Taq in the two aspects, as in addition to their com-
bined resistance to hemoglobin/hemin and serum IgG,
they seem to be capable of more eﬃciently traversing
inhibitor-blocked DNA templates.
Single amino-acid changes at Glu708 were implicated in
both desired phenotypes of blood and soil resistance of the
mutants. Functional analysis revealed that the same
amino-acid substitutions in that position were responsible
both for the blood and soil resistance features. Interest-
ingly, not all of the selected functional changes were
equally eﬃcient in the context of Klentaq1 and Taq
DNA polymerase. Lys and Leu substitutions were eﬃcient
in both enzymes, while Asn, Gln and Ile were only func-
tional in Taq and Trp was only functional in Klentaq1.
The two phenotypes were not tightly coupled. The Klen-
taq 7 and 12 mutants (Glu708Trp and Glu708Leu) exhib-
ited a signiﬁcant resistance to blood but not to soil
inhibitors, while another Klentaq1 mutant (Glu708Arg)
was predominantly soil resistant (data not shown).
The changes of the acidic and hydrophilic w.t. Glu 708
were relatively more drastic in the cases of Lys, Leu and
Ile mutants by reversing the charge or polarity. However,
more subtle substitutions with the two acidic amides Gln
and Asn were highly eﬃcient in producing the desired
phenotype in Taq as well. It still remains to be determined
how the amino-acid substitutions at codon 708 correlate

structure from pdb ﬁle 2KTQ (51) emphasizes the location of the resi-
dues mutated in KlenTaq 10. Using full-length Taq numbering, w.t.

mutations), and 708 (orange, blood and soil-resistance mutation) using

upper left is the ﬁngers domain, where the mutations can be seen at
the surface of the hinge point (knuckles) of the ﬁngers. Primer and

with the SYBR Green resistance aspect of the mutants,
and whether the enzyme speed is aﬀected by the dye.
Our results strongly indicate that Glu708 is critical for
the catalytic function. In accordance with this, we found
that the substitutions Pro and Cys, potentially causing
either kink in the chain or formation of disulﬁde bonds,
inactivated both the Klentaq1 and Taq enzyme.
The position of Glu 708, depicted in Figure 9, falls in an
alpha-helix region on the surface of the enzyme, known as
‘P’ domain (residues 704–717). This domain is situated
about 40 residues apart from the ‘ﬁnger’ domain which
binds the incoming dNTPs and interacts with the single-
stranded DNA template (50,51). The residue locates at the
hinge region, which is believed to allow movement of the
ﬁnger domains at microsecond time-scale as the polymer-
ase evaluates the correctness of base pairs before incor-
poration. During incorporation, the ﬁngers move even to
collapse the enzyme active site for reaction (51,52). The
coincidence of resistance phenotype and speed phenotype
may indicate that some PCR inhibitors interact at the sur-
face of the enzyme in such a way that they slow down the
movement of the ﬁngers, which eﬀect may be reduced with
the 708 mutations.
In a previous study we found that an adjacent residue,
Ile 707 renders the enzyme cold-sensitive when changed to
Leu. Such Cs-mutants perform as highly speciﬁc ‘hot-
start’ PCR enzymes. Remarkably, several neighboring
codons implicated in the Cs-phenotype were mapped in
this area as well, including the Glu 708 (moderately
cold-sensitive when changed to Asp) (39).
At present it is unclear if this functional overlap of
seemingly unrelated phenotypes has some functional rele-
vance. Regardless, control tests with our best Cs-mutants
(data not shown) and commercial hot-start enzymes (the
present data) showed that neither the cold sensitivity nor
the hot start feature alone is suﬃcient to overcome the
blood or soil inhibition in PCR.
The novel mutant Taq and Klentaq enzymes should
provide a simpliﬁed and eﬃcient protocol for direct
DNA ampliﬁcation in crude blood and soil samples.
Therefore, they could signiﬁcantly facilitate some clinical
and forensic PCR-based tests.
