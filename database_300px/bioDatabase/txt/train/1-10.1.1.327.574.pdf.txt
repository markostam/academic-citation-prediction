Abstract The process of cholesterol absorption has yet to
be completely defined at the molecular level. Because of its
ability to esterify cholesterol for packaging into nascent chy-
lomicrons, ACAT2 plays an important role in cholesterol ab-
sorption. However, it has been found that cholesterol absorp-
tion is not completely inhibited in ACAT2-deficient (ACAT2
KO) mice. Because ABCA1 mRNA expression was increased
3-fold in the small intestine of ACAT2 KO mice, we hypoth-
esized that ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux sustains cho-
lesterol absorption in the absence of ACAT2. To test this
hypothesis, cholesterol absorption was measured in mice de-
ficient in both ABCA1 and ACAT2 (DKO). Compared with
wild-type, ABCA1 KO, or ACAT2 KO mice, DKO mice dis-
played the lowest level of cholesterol absorption. The concen-
trations of hepatic free and esterified cholesterol and gall-
bladder bile cholesterol were significantly reduced in DKO
compared with wild-type and ABCA1 KO mice, although these
measures of hepatic cholesterol metabolism were very simi-
lar in DKO and ACAT2 KO mice.  We conclude that ABCA1,
especially in the absence of ACAT2, can have a significant
effect on cholesterol absorption, although ACAT2 has a more
substantial role in this process than ABCA1.

Because the level of cholesterol absorption can influ-
ence plasma cholesterol concentrations (1), disruption of
intestinal cholesterol transport by pharmacological means
has been proven to reduce the concentration of plasma
LDL cholesterol, the latter a risk factor that is tightly linked
to the development of coronary heart disease. For exam-
ple, administration of ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption
 
inhibitor, caused LDL cholesterol concentrations to decrease
by 20%, whereas a reduction of almost 60% was achieved
when ezetimibe and a statin were given together (2). Thus,
inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption may provide
an effective means of preventing coronary heart disease,
the single leading cause of death in the United States (3).
Although it is recognized that cholesterol absorption can
have a significant impact on plasma cholesterol levels, many
of the molecular mechanisms controlling cholesterol ab-
sorption remain to be elucidated. One cellular compo-
nent of cholesterol absorption appears to be ACAT2. ACAT2
is a transmembrane protein that is expressed in the rough
endoplasmic reticulum of enterocytes (4, 5) and esterifies
free cholesterol that has been either synthesized de novo
or internalized from the intestinal lumen (6, 7). Because a
limited amount of free cholesterol can associate with the
phospholipid monolayer of chylomicrons, the production
of cholesteryl ester by ACAT2 allows cholesterol to be more
efficiently packaged into apolipoprotein B (apoB)-con-
taining lipoproteins formed during lipid absorption. For
example, after a meal, cholesteryl ester can represent up
to 78% of the total cholesterol in chylomicrons (8–12),
which carry 
 

 
85% of the total cholesterol secreted by the
small intestine into lymph (7, 9). Thus, under normal cir-
cumstances, ACAT2 esterifies the majority of cholesterol
absorbed by the body.
Direct evidence for the involvement of ACAT2 in cho-
lesterol absorption comes from studies of ACAT2-deficient
(ACAT2 KO) mice. In these studies, it was shown that as
dietary cholesterol content was incrementally increased,
ACAT2 KO mice absorbed proportionally less cholesterol
than wild-type mice (13, 14). Although this finding impli-
cated ACAT2 as a significant factor in cholesterol absorp-
tion, the incomplete inhibition of this process in ACAT2

KO mice indicated that cholesterol absorption may be me-
diated by additional mechanisms. One of these pathways
may be via ABCA1. Expressed in enterocytes and many other
cell types in the body (15), ABCA1 is a transmembrane
protein that mediates the efflux of phospholipids and free
cholesterol to lipid-poor apolipoproteins, such as apoA-I
and apoE (16, 17).
Based on the current literature, the importance of ABCA1
in cholesterol absorption is unclear. Using CaCo-2 cells, an
immortalized cell line with properties similar to those of
enterocytes, it has been shown that free cholesterol can be
effluxed, presumably via ABCA1, from the basolateral
membrane of the cells (18–20). In animal models, choles-
terol absorption has been shown to decrease by 13% in
ABCA1 KO mice (21) and by 79% in ABCA1 KO chickens
(22). In contrast, other studies have reported that ABCA1
KO mice displayed either similar (23) or significantly in-
creased (24) cholesterol absorption compared with wild-
type mice. A patient with Tangier disease had a cholesterol
absorption percentage similar to those of control subjects
(25). Therefore, ABCA1 appears to mediate only a limited
amount of cholesterol absorption. However, when other
components in the process are not functioning normally,
such as when ACAT2 is missing, ABCA1 might assume a
more significant role.
The main line of evidence supporting the hypothesis
that cholesterol absorption is sustained by ABCA1 in the
absence of ACAT2 comes from a study showing that ABCA1
mRNA expression was significantly greater in ACAT2 KO
compared with wild-type small intestine (14). Because the
regulatory pool of free cholesterol may be increased in en-
terocytes of ACAT2 KO mice, the increase in ABCA1 ex-
pression is likely mediated by liver X receptor (LXR) acti-
vation (26). In turn, an increase in ABCA1-mediated
cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apolipoproteins may serve
as a means of cholesterol absorption in ACAT2 KO mice.
To test the hypothesis that cholesterol absorption can be
partially maintained by ABCA1 in the absence of ACAT2,
the present study of intestinal cholesterol transport and
hepatic cholesterol metabolism was conducted using mice
deficient in both ABCA1 and ACAT2 (DKO mice).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
 
Mice
 
All mice were maintained in an American Association for Ac-
creditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved animal facility
under protocols approved by the institutional animal care and
use committee at Wake Forest University School of Medicine.
Male wild-type mice (50% C57Bl/6, 50% 129Sv/Jae) were pur-
chased from Jackson Laboratories, and male ACAT2 KO mice
(50% C57Bl/6, 50% 129Sv/Jae) were provided by Dr. Robert J.
Farese, Jr. (13). To generate DKO mice, ACAT2 KO mice were
crossed with ABCA1 KO mice (50% FVB, 50% 129Sv/Jae) pro-
vided by CV Therapeutics. ABCA1 KO mice were created by Dr.

Fractional cholesterol absorption
 
Male wild-type and ACAT2 KO mice at least 6 weeks of age and
6–7 week old female wild-type, ABCA1 KO, ACAT2 KO, and
DKO mice were offered 10 g/day of a low-fat (20% of energy as
palm-enriched fat), moderate-cholesterol (0.17%, w/w) diet. Af-
ter feeding the diet to the males for 10 days and to the females
for 4 weeks, the mice were gavaged with 0.1

wire bottom and was allowed free access to diet and water for 3
days. The feces were collected and homogenized in 95% ethanol
using a Polytron PT 1200 homogenizer (Kinematica). An aliquot
of the fecal slurry was saponified by adding 50% KOH to a final
concentration of 5% (w/v) and heating at 65

Fecal neutral sterol excretion
 
After being fed the low-fat, moderate-cholesterol diet for 5
weeks, female mice were singly housed as described above. After
a 3 day fecal collection, the mice were weighed, and the feces
were collected, dried in a 70

-cholestane as an
internal standard. The feces were saponified and the neutral lip-
ids were extracted into hexane as described above. Mass analysis
of the extracted neutral sterols was conducted by gas-liquid chro-
matography as described previously (27). Fecal neutral sterol mass
represents the sum of cholesterol, coprostanol, and coprostanone
in each sample. Fecal neutral sterol excretion was expressed as
mg sterol/day/100 g body weight.
 
Plasma, hepatic, and biliary lipid concentrations
 
After being fed the low-fat, moderate-cholesterol diet for 6
weeks, mice were fasted for 4 h and euthanized. Blood was col-
lected by heart puncture and was placed into a tube containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) dissolved in 5% EDTA, 5%

tine from the pyloric valve to the cecum was removed, cleaned of
fat and luminal contents while on ice, and cut into either three
sections of equal length for the male ACAT2 KO experiments or
five pieces of equal length for the female DKO experiments. The

mined after separation of lipoprotein classes from whole plasma
by gel filtration chromatography as described previously (28).

RESULTS
 
Intestinal cholesterol absorption in ABCA1 KO and 
ACAT2 KO mice
 
To verify that cholesterol absorption was reduced in
ACAT2 KO mice fed a semisynthetic diet without the fiber-
rich properties of chow, male wild-type and ACAT2 KO
mice were fed a low-fat (20% of energy as palm oil), mod-
erate-cholesterol (0.17%, w/w) diet and fractional choles-
terol absorption was measured using the fecal dual-isotope
method. Similar to other studies (13, 14), fractional cho-
lesterol absorption was decreased from 53% in wild-type
mice to 35% in ACAT2 KO mice (
 
Fig. 1A
 
). However,
much of the cholesterol was still absorbed by the ACAT2
KO mice, suggesting that, in the absence of ACAT2, re-
dundant pathways were allowing cholesterol absorption to
be sustained. Because previous evidence indicated that
ABCA1 could play a role in cholesterol absorption (14,
21), real-time PCR analysis of ABCA1 mRNA expression in
the small intestine was conducted. Compared with wild-
type mice, ACAT2 KO mice had an almost 3-fold increase
in the expression of ABCA1 (Fig. 1B). This result sup-
ported the hypothesis that increased expression of ABCA1
in the absence of ACAT2 allowed cholesterol absorption
to be partially maintained.
To test this hypothesis, ABCA1 KO mice were mated
with ACAT2 KO mice and the offspring were crossed to
create DKO mice. Cholesterol absorption was then mea-
sured in female DKO mice along with wild-type, ABCA1
KO, and ACAT2 KO mice fed the low-fat, moderate-cho-
lesterol diet. Using the fecal dual-isotope method, choles-
terol absorption was decreased from 63% in wild-type mice
to 25% in DKO mice (
 
Fig. 2A
 
). Fractional cholesterol ab-
sorption was also reduced to 55% in ABCA1 KO mice and
to 35% in ACAT2 KO mice, and the sum of these decreases
was similar to the decline displayed by the DKO mice. The
extent of cholesterol absorption was also estimated by ana-
lyzing the excretion of neutral sterols in the feces. In
agreement with the fractional cholesterol absorption data,
sterol excretion was significantly increased from 11 mg/
day/100 g body weight in the wild-type mice to 26 mg/
day/100 g body weight in the DKO mice (Fig. 2B). The
ACAT2 KO mice also showed a significant increase in neu-
tral sterol excretion (18 mg/day/100 g body weight),
whereas the mean value was not significantly higher in the
ABCA1 KO mice (14 mg/day/100 g body weight). The
data show that cholesterol absorption can be mediated by
both ABCA1 and ACAT2 and that this process was greatly
decreased when both of these proteins were absent.
Real-time PCR analysis was used to determine whether
any differences occurred in the expression of genes involved
in the trafficking of cholesterol through the enterocytes.
For this experiment, RNA was isolated from the duode-

num and proximal jejunum. The mRNA of Niemann-Pick
C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which is the target of the cholesterol
absorption inhibitor ezetimibe (31), was decreased to 
 

 
60%
of that of the wild type in the small intestine of DKO mice
(
 
Fig. 3A
 
). A similar decrease in NPC1L1 mRNA was also
observed for the small intestine of ACAT2 KO mice, al-
though no significant change was seen in the intestine of
ABCA1 KO mice. Because ABCG5, in concert with ABCG8,
is believed to efflux excess cholesterol from enterocytes
into the lumen of the intestine (32, 33), the mRNA level
of this LXR-sensitive gene was also determined. Although
a trend toward increased expression was evident for the
ACAT2 KO mice, the amounts of ABCG5 mRNA were not
significantly different in the small intestines of the four
different genotypes of mice (Fig. 3B).
 
Hepatic cholesterol metabolism in ABCA1 KO and 
ACAT2 KO mice
 
It was hypothesized that because of significant decreases
in cholesterol absorption, the livers of DKO mice would re-
flect the changes in intestinal cholesterol metabolism. Ac-
cordingly, hepatic lipid compositions were determined. Al-
though no statistically significant differences were found
between wild-type and ABCA1 KO mouse livers, the livers of
DKO mice contained 30% less free cholesterol and 99% less
cholesteryl ester (
 
Fig. 4A
 
, 
 
B
 
). In addition, a reduction of
64% was observed for hepatic triglyceride content of DKO
versus wild-type and ABCA1 KO mice (Fig. 4C). ACAT2
KO mice had similar reductions in hepatic concentrations
of these three lipids as DKO mice. Thus, even though the
DKO mice displayed lower fractional cholesterol absorp-
tion than the ACAT2 KO mice (Fig. 2), the livers from these
two genotypes showed similarly decreased concentrations
of free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and triglyceride.
The lipid composition of gallbladder bile collected from
fasted mice was also analyzed. No significant differences
in cholesterol, bile salt, and phospholipid concentrations
were found upon comparison of DKO and ACAT2 KO gall-
bladder bile (
 
Table 2
 
). However, the concentrations of cho-
lesterol and phospholipids were significantly decreased in
the DKO and ACAT2 KO mice compared with the wild-
type and ABCA1 KO mice (Table 2). Because the bile can

be concentrated while being collected in the gallbladder,
the percentage molar composition of the bile was calcu-
lated. The bile from DKO and ACAT2 KO mice contained
a lower molar percentage of cholesterol than that from
wild-type mice, whereas ABCA1 KO mouse bile contained
a significantly higher molar percentage of cholesterol.
ACAT2 KO and DKO mice also had bile with lower molar
percentages of phospholipids and higher molar percentages
of bile acids than ABCA1 mice. These differences could be
indications of an increased tendency for bile acid secretion
in mice that cannot esterify cholesterol in the hepatocyte.
The results also showed that in spite of significant differ-
ences in cholesterol absorption, cholesterol excretion into
the bile was similar in DKO and ACAT2 KO mice.
The expression of some of the genes involved in he-
patic cholesterol homeostasis was also examined. Using
real-time PCR, it was found that DKO mice compared with
ABCA1 KO mice displayed significantly higher expression
of mRNA for HMG-CoA synthase (
 
Fig. 5A
 
), which is the
rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. In addition,
the mRNA level of the LXR-responsive gene ABCG5 (Fig.
5B) was significantly reduced from wild-type levels in the
DKO liver. Significant differences in the mRNA of 7
 

 
-
hydroxylase were not found in the DKO liver (Fig. 5C).
Thus, the data are consistent with an increase in choles-
terol synthesis and a decrease in the availability of choles-
terol for secretion into bile in DKO mice. However, the
differences in regulation of the mRNA expression of these
genes were relatively small, and the compensatory mecha-
nisms of the reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption in
the livers of the DKO mice were apparently relatively sub-
tle and not clearly evident in mRNA measurements.

sence of either ABCA1 or ACAT2 causes a significant re-
duction in plasma cholesterol (13, 24), it was predicted
that DKO mice would have the lowest plasma cholesterol
concentrations of the four genotypes. Compared with
wild-type and ACAT2 KO mice, the plasma total choles-
terol (TPC) concentration of DKO mice was significantly
lower (
 
Table 3
 
). However, unexpectedly, 2.5-fold more
TPC was present in the plasma of DKO versus ABCA1 KO
mice. This was not the result of an increase in HDL cho-
lesterol but instead was attributable to a higher concentra-
tion of cholesterol in VLDL- and LDL-sized particles. In-
terestingly, almost all of the cholesterol found in the
plasma of DKO mice was free cholesterol, which was not
the case for any of the other genotypes. Thus, the higher
than expected TPC concentration of the DKO mice re-
sulted from the presence of free cholesterol-enriched VLDL-
and LDL-sized particles.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, DKO mice were used to test the hy-
pothesis that, in the absence of ACAT2, intestinal choles-
terol absorption can be partially maintained by ABCA1.
Fractional cholesterol absorption was decreased signifi-
cantly in ACAT2 KO versus wild-type mice (35% vs. 63%),

Cholesterol absorption in ABCA1- and ACAT2-deficient mice 2429
 
but an even greater reduction was observed for DKO mice
(25%) (Fig. 2A). In addition, fecal neutral sterol excre-
tion was increased by 130% in DKO mice but by only 64%
in ACAT2 KO mice (Fig. 2B). Although a statistically sig-
nificant decrease in fractional cholesterol absorption was
seen in ABCA1 KO mice (down to 55% from 63%) (Fig.
2A), this effect was small and did not result in a significant
increase in neutral sterol excretion (Fig. 2B). These results
show that ABCA1 contributes minimally to cholesterol ab-
sorption when ACAT2 is functional. In agreement with
this conclusion, previous studies have shown that fecal
neutral sterol excretion is similar in ABCA1 KO and wild-
type mice (23) and that fractional cholesterol absorption
is decreased by only 13% in ABCA1 KO mice (21) compared
with 60–85% in ACAT2 KO mice (13, 14). However, in the
absence of ACAT2, the increased expression of ABCA1
(Fig. 1B) (14), presumably in response to an accumulation
of intracellular free cholesterol, oxysterol formation, and
subsequent transcriptional upregulation via LXR, may par-
tially compensate for the lack of cholesterol esterification
and provide for some movement of cholesterol into the
body.
The mechanism by which ABCA1 mediates cholesterol
absorption is currently unknown. Most likely, it involves
ABCA1-dependent efflux of free cholesterol from the ba-
solateral surface of the enterocytes to lipid-poor apolipo-
proteins such as apoA-I. In agreement with this hypothesis,
studies in CaCo-2 cells have shown that free cholesterol
can be trafficked from the apical to the basolateral surface
of the cell and subsequently effluxed, presumably via ABCA1,
on HDL particles (18–20). Alternatively, ABCA1 may have
an indirect role in cholesterol absorption as a result of its
requirement in the formation of mature HDL particles. In
this scenario, cholesterol from the enterocytes would be
effluxed to mature, spherical HDLs via a receptor other than
ABCA1. Two possible candidate receptors are ABCG1 and
scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), both of which ef-
flux cholesterol to spherical HDLs (34, 35). Although SR-
BI KO mice do not display a defect in cholesterol absorp-
tion (36), cholesterol efflux mediated by SR-BI, which is
expressed on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes (37,
38), could become important in ACAT2 KO mice. ABCG1
could also aid ACAT2 KO mice in cholesterol absorption.
LXR agonist treatment of CaCo-2 cells increased ABCG1
expression and cholesterol efflux to exogenously added
HDL (19). However, in the presence or absence of LXR
agonist, ABCG1 expression in mice was detected only in
resident macrophages of the small intestine and not in en-
terocytes (39). Thus, it is also possible that another currently
unknown receptor could mediate the efflux of cholesterol
to mature HDL. Further experiments will be necessary to
define the exact role that ABCA1 plays in cholesterol ab-
sorption.
In the absence of both ABCA1 and ACAT2, the absorp-
tion of cholesterol was presumably limited to free choles-
terol incorporation into the chylomicrons. Because the ca-
pacity of this mechanism is likely much more limited than
esterification via the ACAT2-dependent pathway, unchecked
movement of cholesterol into the DKO enterocytes could
have had deleterious effects. Possibly to avoid the poten-
tial toxic effects of excess intracellular cholesterol, the ex-
pression of NPC1L1 was decreased significantly (Fig. 3A),
an effect similar to that shown for wild-type and ACAT2
KO mice fed a high-cholesterol diet (14, 40). This down-
regulation of NPC1L1 in the enterocytes presumably led
to a reduction in the movement of cholesterol from the
lumen of the small intestine into the cells. The entero-
cytes also could have eliminated excess free cholesterol by
upregulating the expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8, which
presumably efflux free cholesterol back into the lumen of
the small intestine (32). However, compared with wild-type
mice, DKO mice did not display a significant increase in
ABCG5 mRNA expression in the small intestine (Fig. 3B).
This result, which is in accordance with data on wild-type
and ACAT2 KO mice fed a high-cholesterol diet (14), in-
dicates that regardless of genotype, ABCG5 mRNA may
have been maximally expressed as a result of the consump-
tion of a cholesterol-rich diet. Nevertheless, DKO entero-
cytes could have had either increased expression of ABCG5
and ABCG8 protein or improved functional activity from
the existing ABCG5 and ABCG8 protein complexes. Thus,
a combination of decreased cholesterol uptake caused by
the downregulation of NPC1L1 and increased cholesterol
efflux via ABCG5 and ABCG8 may serve to maintain free
cholesterol levels in DKO enterocytes.
The liver is the clearinghouse for cholesterol associated
with chylomicrons and HDL that originate from the small
intestine. Therefore, it was predicted that hepatic choles-
terol metabolism would mirror the amount of cholesterol
absorption displayed by the four genotypes of mice. This

assumption was correct for the wild-type and ABCA1 KO
mice because these two genotypes had similar levels of cho-
lesterol absorption (Fig. 2) and nearly identical hepatic
lipid concentrations (Fig. 4), gallbladder bile composition
(Table 2), and hepatic mRNA expression of genes in-
volved in cholesterol homeostasis (Fig. 5). These results
are similar to those reported previously for wild-type and
ABCA1 KO mice (23) and support the conclusion that in the
presence of ACAT2, ABCA1 has an auxiliary role in cho-
lesterol absorption. The idea that cholesterol absorption
directly affects hepatic cholesterol homeostasis was also
confirmed by findings in ACAT2 KO mice. Compared with
wild-type and ABCA1 KO mice, ACAT2 KO mice absorbed
significantly less cholesterol, which may contribute to an
 

 
2-fold reduction in cholesterol concentration in gallblad-
der bile (Table 2). In addition, ACAT2 KO mice displayed
decreases of 30% and 99% in hepatic free cholesterol and
cholesteryl ester concentration, respectively (Fig. 4), the
latter reduction being compounded by the hepatocytes
lacking their sole cholesterol-esterifying enzyme, ACAT2
(13, 41, 42). Because DKO mice exhibited the largest de-
crease in cholesterol absorption (Fig. 2), an even greater
alteration in hepatic cholesterol metabolism was expected
for these mice. However, compared with ACAT2 KO mice,
DKO mice displayed similar concentrations of biliary cho-
lesterol, bile salt, and hepatic free cholesterol (Table 2,
Fig. 4A). In addition, only slight differences between these
two genotypes were seen for the hepatic expression of cho-
lesterol-sensitive genes such as HMG-CoA synthase, ABCG5,
and sterol-regulatory element binding protein 1c (Fig. 5).
One explanation for the minimal variations in hepatic cho-
lesterol metabolism in ACAT2 KO and DKO mice could
relate to the differences in hepatic HDL formation. In liver-
specific ABCA1 KO mice, the hepatocyte was found to be
the most important cell in the formation of nascent HDL
(43). Therefore, the greater amount of cholesterol ab-
sorbed by ACAT2 KO versus DKO mice could have been
directed toward ABCA1-dependent HDL formation in the
liver and away from excretion into bile and the synthesis
of bile acids. Consequently, the amount of cholesterol
available for excretion into bile could have been similar in
ACAT2 KO and DKO mice.
Previous studies have shown that deficiencies in either
ABCA1 or ACAT2 cause significant decreases in total plasma
cholesterol. Because ABCA1 is essential in the formation
of nascent HDL particles, ABCA1 deficiency results in
nearly undetectable levels of HDL cholesterol (24, 44, 45).
On the other hand, because ACAT2 creates cholesteryl es-
ter that is packaged into chylomicrons and VLDL, ACAT2
KO mice display a significant decrease in cholesterol car-
ried in apoB-containing lipoproteins (13, 28, 46). Because
of these major effects on lipoprotein cholesterol, it was as-
sumed that DKO mice would have lower TPC concentra-
tions than mice lacking either ABCA1 or ACAT2. As ex-
pected, the TPC of DKO mice was significantly less than in
both wild-type and ACAT2 KO mice (Table 3). However,
because of an increase in cholesterol carried in VLDL- and
LDL-sized particles, DKO mice had 
 

 
3-fold more TPC
than ABCA1 KO mice. In fact, compared with the other
three groups, DKO mice had the highest concentration of
VLDL plus LDL cholesterol. Also unexpected was the find-
ing that 
 

 
90% of the cholesterol in the plasma of DKO
mice was free cholesterol, compared with 30% or less for
the other genotypes. Preliminary experiments to deter-
mine the cause of the increased concentrations of free
cholesterol and VLDL/LDL cholesterol have shown that
plasma LCAT activity is drastically reduced in DKO mice.
This LCAT insufficiency in combination with the absence
of ACAT2 results in the accumulation of particles in the
LDL density range that lack cholesteryl ester and are en-
riched in free cholesterol and phospholipids (R. E. Temel,
H. M. Alger, and L. L. Rudel, unpublished data). LDL par-
ticles with characteristics similar to those of DKO mice
were also found in mice with null mutations in both LCAT
and ACAT2 (47). The reasons for the buildup of these ab-
normal LDLs in plasma are not completely clear; however,
cholesteryl esters derived from either ACAT2 or LCAT
may be essential for maintaining the structural integrity of
LDL. Accordingly, LDL particles lacking a core of choles-
teryl ester could assume an irregular shape, thus changing
the conformation of apoB or apoE and limiting the he-
patic clearance of the LDL. To test these conclusions, ex-
periments analyzing plasma lipoprotein metabolism in
the DKO mice are currently under way.
