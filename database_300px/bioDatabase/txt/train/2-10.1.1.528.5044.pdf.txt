Abstract
Background The assessment of mental health
problems in children with intellectual disability (ID)
mostly occurs by filling out long questionnaires that
are not always validated for children without ID.
The aim of this study is to assess the differences in
mental health problems between children with ID
and without ID, using a short questionnaire, the
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
Methods We studied 260 children (6–12 years)
selected from special education schools for trainable
children (response: 57%). Parents completed the
extended Dutch version of the SDQ, questions on
background characteristics and on the care pro-
vided. A non-ID control group of 707 children
(response: 87%) was included to compare mental
health problems.
Results In total, 60.9% of children with ID had an
elevated score on the SDQ, compared with 9.8% of
children without ID. Only 45% of the children with
ID and an elevated SDQ score had visited a
healthcare professional for these problems in the
last 6 months.
Discussion The SDQ or an adapted version could
contribute to the early identification of mental
health problems in children with ID. Further
research is needed to confirm the validity of the
SDQ when used in a sample of children with ID.

Introduction
People with intellectual disability (ID) are more at
risk for health problems than people without ID
(Van Schrojenstein Lantman-de Valk et al. 2000;
Jansen et al. 2004). Both the prevalence of physical
disorders (Van Schrojenstein Lantman-de Valk et al.
1997) and of mental health problems (Holland &
Koot 1998) is higher in people with ID than in
people without ID. In many cases these mental
health problems in people with ID are already
present at a young age: estimates of the prevalence
of mental health problems in children with ID
range from 30% to 60%.The wide prevalence range
is, among other things, a result of differentiation in
the definition of mental health problems and the

use of different instruments to assess these prob-
lems (Einfeld & Tonge 1996b; Linna et al. 1999;
Dekker et al. 2002).
Two often used instruments for the assessment of
mental health problems in children with ID are the
Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC) and
the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (Einfeld &
Tonge 1995; Dekker et al. 2002; Buelow et al. 2003;
Koskentausta et al. 2004). The DBC is a 96-item
multiple-choice questionnaire administered by
parents or teachers that describes emotional and
behavioural disturbance in young people with ID
(Einfeld & Tonge 1995). The CBCL is a question-
naire consisting of 113 descriptive items that pro-
vides a parental report of the extent of a child’s
behavioural problems and social competencies.
Although both questionnaires have achieved wide
acceptance, both the DBC and the CBCL are long
questionnaires with 96 and 113 items, respectively.
Recently, a short form of the DBC is developed
(the DBC-P24). However, this short form is not
intended as an instrument for estimating any sub-
scores (Taffe et al. 2007). Next to it, the DBC is not
designed for use in young people without ID.
Another widely used questionnaire for detecting
mental health problems in children is the Strengths
and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).The SDQ
consists of 25 items subdivided into five scales:
emotional symptoms, conduct problems,
inattention-hyperactivity, peer problems and proso-
cial behaviour (Goodman 1997).
In several studies, the psychometric properties of
the SDQ and the CBCL are compared (Goodman
& Scott 1999; Klasen et al. 2000; VanWidenfelt
et al. 2003). These studies showed that the SDQ
and the CBCL are equally valid for most clinical
and research purposes, but that at the same time
the SDQ and CBCL also differ in several respects.
First of all, certain items of the SDQ are phrased
positively in order to increase the questionnaire’s
acceptability to respondents. Conversely, compa-
rable items of the CBCL include only negative
items (Goodman & Scott 1999). Another difference
concerns the SDQ’s impact supplement providing
an estimate of burden, which is a part of the diag-
nostic criteria in child and adolescent psychiatry. It
is probable that a combination of symptom and
impact scores will be the best indicator of caseness
as was the case for the British version of the SDQ
(Obel et al. 2004). One of the most obvious differ-
ences, however, lies in the length of the question-
naires. The SDQ has 25 items whereas the CBCL
consists of 118 items. Evidently, the advantage of a
short questionnaire is that the filling out is less bur-
densome for the participants to complete.
According to Vostanis (2006), there has been
almost no research with the SDQ among children
with ID.The only evidence comes from a secondary
analysis of a national survey of the mental health of
4172 children and adolescents between 5 and
15 years in the UK by Emerson (Emerson 2005;
Vostanis 2006). However, in that survey it was
unclear whether children had or had not an ID. As
a result, Emerson had to combine survey items to
identify children who were likely to have ID. In this
way, eventually 124 children were operationally
defined as having ID.The results of the study of
Emerson shows that de SDQ appears to be a very
useful measure of mental health problems of chil-
dren and adolescents with ID.The results also illus-
trate that children with ID report greater difficulties
than their non-ID peers on all subscales except for
prosocial behaviour (Emerson 2005). The aim of
this study is to investigate whether previous differ-
ences between children with and without ID in
emotional and behavioural problems, using more
time consuming measures, can also be found using
a short questionnaire, the SDQ.
Methods
Participants and procedure
Data were obtained by using a two-stage sample
procedure. The primary sampling cluster concerned
all primary special education schools for trainable
children in the provinces of Groningen and
Drenthe. This primary sample was stratified by the
moment of receiving a routine visit by the child
healthcare physician. Next, all schools who received
a routine visit within the next three moments
(n = 7) were asked to participate in the study
(response 100%). As the name suggests, the visits of
the child healthcare physicians were routine and
basically without specific reason on that particular
moment. Since the chance of receiving a routine
visit within the next 3 months was equally for all

schools, the sample can be considered as random,
leading to valid population estimates.
In the Netherlands the special education schools
for trainable children (children with a mild or
moderate ID) are attended by children with an
IQ < 60 or an IQ of 60–70 and additional difficul-
ties (Wallander et al. 2006). All parents of children
aged 6–12 years attending one of these schools
(n = 457) were asked to fill out a questionnaire.
If parents did not return the questionnaire, they
were sent a reminder. Of the 457 approached
parents, 262 participated (57%) (of which two
were excluded because their child exceeded the
age range).
A control group was included to compare prob-
lems in behaviour, emotions and relationships in
children with ID to those without ID.This non-ID
sample was obtained from a previous study that
used a two-step sampling procedure. In the first
step, a national sample from nine of the 41 Dutch
Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH) Services was
taken. In the second step, each Service provided a
sample of children aged 7–12 years who were
invited for routine well-child examinations (Vogels
et al. 2005; Reijneveld et al. 2006). The Dutch PCH
services provide routine health examinations for the
entire population which offers an ideal setting for
the early detection of psychosocial problems among
children (Brugman et al. 2001; Reijneveld et al.
2004). Next these PCH-services gathered data of
children aged 7–12 years old. Thirty-five child
health professionals participated in this study. In
total, 814 parents and their children were asked to
participate in this study, 10% refused to participate
and 3% did not return the questionnaire, resulting
in a response of 711 children (87%) (Vogels et al.
2005).
Measures
Parents were asked to fill out a questionnaire which
consisted of the validated Dutch version of the
extended SDQ, questions about the care provided
and questions on background characteristics. The
SDQ is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire
that provides a balanced conception of children and
young people’s behaviour, emotions and relation-
ships (Goodman 1997). The extended version also
includes an impact supplement that asks if the
respondent thinks the young person has a problem,
and if so, enquires further about chronicity, distress,
social impairment, and burden for others. Several
studies have shown the good reliability and validity
of the SDQ in a non-ID population (Goodman &
Scott 1999; Smedje et al. 1999; Koskelainen et al.
2000; Goodman 2001; Muris et al. 2003; Van
Widenfelt et al. 2003). For the purposes of this
study we used the cut-off scores provided by
Vogels et al. (2005) for use in Dutch PCH.
Regarding care provided parents were asked
which healthcare professional their child had visited
in the last 6 months because of problems with
behaviour, emotions or relationships. Questions on
background characteristics concerned sex and date
of birth of the child, living situation and severity of
the ID.
Analysis
First, Cronbach’s Alphas of the (sub)scales were
computed for children with ID and without ID.
Subsequently, we assessed differences in problems
regarding behaviour, emotions and relationships in
girls and boys with ID, using independent sample
T-tests.
Next, we compared differences in these prob-
lems between children with and without ID. We
computed Cohen’s d effect sizes and performed
T-tests. Effect sizes <0.20 were considered to be
trivial, 0.20–0.50 small, 0.50–0.80 moderate and
0.80 large. Finally, we assessed differences in the
(sub)scale scores for children with ID and without
ID for boys and girls separately, using two-way
analysis of variance. To check whether the effect of
sex on (sub)scale scores was different for the two
groups, we added an interaction term (ID/non-
ID*sex).
Results
Background characteristics
In the sample of children with ID the mean age was
9.8 years, 59% of the children were male and 92%
lived at home with their parents. The mean age of
the children without ID was 10.2 years and 50% of
them was male.

Internal consistency
In Table 1 the internal consistencies of the SDQ
(sub)scales are presented for children with ID and
without ID. Most consistencies were slightly higher
for children with ID.
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-scores
Using the same cut-off as Vogels et al. (2005)
60.9% of children with ID had an elevated score on
the SDQ, compared with 9.8% of children without
ID.The mean scores on the SDQ-subscales and
total difficulties scale for children with ID and
without ID are shown in Table 2. Comparison of
the scores on the SDQ-subscales and total difficul-
ties scale in children with ID with non-ID children
showed that children with ID had significantly
higher mean scores on all subscales, on the total
difficulties scale and on the impact scale (all
P < 0.0001). The effect sizes, as the values of
Cohen’s d indicate, are large for all scales (Table 2).
An effect size of 0 indicates complete overlap of the
two groups whereas an effect size of 1 indicates
55.4% of non-overlap between the groups.
The sample of children with ID shows a statisti-
cally significant difference between girls and boys in
the scores for conduct problems, inattention-
hyperactivity, total difficulties (all P < 0.05) and
prosocial behaviour (P < 0.01) (Table 3). Boys with
ID had more problems in the areas of conduct
problems and inattention-hyperactivity and seemed
to have more total difficulties than girls with ID.
Girls with ID scored higher than boys with ID on
prosocial behaviour, which means that they showed
better social behaviour than boys with ID.
Table 3 also shows differences for (sub)scales in
boys and girls with and without ID. Large differ-
ences were found on all (sub)scales, except on emo-
tional symptoms for girls where medium effect size
was found.Two-way analysis of variance was per-
formed to assess differences in the (sub)scale scores
between boys and girls with ID and without ID.
Results show that ID/non-ID has a significant effect
on all the SDQ (sub)scale scores and sex has a sig-
nificant effect on all the SDQ (sub)scale scores,
except on emotional symptoms. Interaction effects
(ID/non-ID*sex) on the SDQ (sub)scale scores
were not significant.
Mental health care
Parents were asked whether their child had visited a
healthcare professional the last 6 months for prob-
lems with behaviour, emotions and relationships.
Rates were higher for children with an elevated
SDQ-score (n = 146, 45%) than for children
without an elevated SDQ-score (n = 65, 14%).
Discussion
Sixty-one per cent of children with ID had prob-
lems with behaviour, emotions and relationships,
compared with 9.8% of children without ID. Forty-
seven per cent of the children with ID had an
elevated score on the subscale inattention-
hyperactivity compared with 9% of the children
without ID. On prosocial behaviour 36% of the
children with ID scored in the deviant range com-
pared with 12% of the children without ID. Mental
health problems were assessed by the SDQ which
has almost never been used in a sample of children
with ID.
Gender had a significant effect on all (sub)scale
scores, except on emotional symptoms. Differences
by gender were the same for children with ID and
without ID, interaction effects (gender*ID/non-ID)
on all SDQ (sub)scale scores, however, were not
significant.
The proportion of mental health problems dis-
covered in this study (61%) is somewhat higher
than in other studies. In a population of 454

children with ID (4–18 years), Einfeld & Tonge
(1996a,b) found a proportion of 41% for definite
psychiatric disorder or major emotional/behavioural
disturbance. They used the DBC to assess behav-
ioural and emotional disturbance in children and
adolescents with ID Einfeld & Tonge (1995).

emotional and behavioural problems in 1041 non-
residential children with ID to 1855 children from
the general population using the CBCL and the
Teacher’s Report Form. In children with ID,
approximately 50% scored in the elevated range of

the Total Problem Score compared with approxi-
mately 18% in the non-disabled children.The
higher proportion that we found may be partly
because of the fact that the SDQ is more sensitive
for the problems met by children with ID.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of the present study are the use of
the SDQ in children with ID and the comparison
with a large population sample of children without
ID.The study comprised 260 children attending a
special education school for trainable children, of
which 92% lived at home. Children with ID visiting
another type of school or a day-care centre were not
included, which may have led to under representa-
tion of children with severe ID. Our already high
proportion may thus be an underestimation of the
mental health problems.
Second, the response in our study was 57%.This
could have lead to selection bias. Although the sex
and age of participating children did not differ from
that of all children with ID attending one of the
participating schools, the proportion of psychopa-
thology may have been different among non-
respondents. If so, it could have an effect on
proportion estimates.
Another limitation of the study is that, as with
other reports of psychometric properties of the
SDQ, certain subscales (peer problems, prosocial
behaviour and conduct problems) had relatively low
internal consistency, probably because of the small
number of items on these scales (VanWidenfelt
et al. 2003).
Implications
Until the current study the SDQ has hardly been
used in children with ID (Vostanis 2006). The inter-
nal consistency of the scales was comparable to the
internal consistency in the sample without ID.
These results are promising and may support the
use of SDQ for assessing mental health problems in
children with ID. However, further research is
needed to confirm the validity of the SDQ when
used in a sample of children with ID.
In the sample studied, 55% of the children with
an elevated score on the SDQ had not visited a
healthcare professional the last 6 months, which
indicates that more than half of the children did not
receive specialized assistance recently. This confirms
previous findings by Einfeld & Tonge (1996b) and
Dekker & Koot (2003). Available evidence indicates
that early interventions may improve the adjustment
of mental health problems Durlak &Wells (1998).
The SDQ or an adapted version could contribute
to the early identification of mental health problems
in children with ID.The Child Health Services in
the Netherlands already use the SDQ as an screen-
ing instrument for early identification of psychoso-
cial problems (such as behavioural and emotional
problems) among children aged between 7 and
12 years attending regular schools (Vogels et al.
2005). Future research should investigate the appli-
cation of the SDQ or an adapted version as a
screening instrument for mental health problems in
children with ID.
More in general, healthcare professionals should
be aware of and sensitive for the mental health
problems of children with ID.This particularly
holds for hyperactivity and social problems.
