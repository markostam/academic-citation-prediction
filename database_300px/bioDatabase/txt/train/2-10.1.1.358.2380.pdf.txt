ABSTRACT
Type I restriction endonucleases are intriguing,
multifunctional complexes that restrict DNA ran-
domly, at sites distant from the target sequence.
Restriction at distant sites is facilitated by ATP
hydrolysis-dependent, translocation of double-
stranded DNA towards the stationary enzyme
bound at the recognition sequence. Following
restriction, the enzymes are thought to remain asso-
ciated with the DNA at the target site, hydrolyzing
copious amounts of ATP. As a result, for the past 35
years type I restriction endonucleases could only be
loosely classified as enzymes since they functioned
stoichiometrically relative to DNA. To further under-
stand enzyme mechanism, a detailed analysis of
DNA cleavage by the EcoR124I holoenzyme was
done. We demonstrate for the first time that type I
restriction endonucleases are not stoichiometric
but are instead catalytic with respect to DNA.
Further, the mechanism involves formation of a
dimer of holoenzymes, with each monomer bound
to a target sequence and, following cleavage, each
dissociates in an intact form to bind and restrict
subsequent DNA molecules. Therefore, type I
restriction endonucleases, like their type II counter-
parts, are true enzymes. The conclusion that type I
restriction enzymes are catalytic relative to DNA
has important implications for the in vivo function
of these previously enigmatic enzymes.
INTRODUCTION
Restriction–modiﬁcation (R–M) systems are part of the
global mechanism designed to maintain the integrity of
bacterial genomes (1,2). These systems have dual functions
as they serve to protect the host genome against restriction
by methylating residues within target sequences, while
simultaneously functioning to destroy foreign DNA. As
these enzymes confer the ability to distinguish self from
non-self, they can be viewed as part of a rudimentary but
eﬀective bacterial immune system (3).
R–M enzymes are classiﬁed into three main groups
designated types I–III, based on their subunit structure,
cofactor requirements, sequence recognition and cleavage
position (4–6). Type II systems are the most well known,
having found widespread use in molecular cloning. They
comprise separate methylases and homodimeric restriction
endonucleases which act independently from one another
and which methylate or cleave a single, 4–8 bp palin-
dromic DNA sequence. Cleavage is catalytic and typically
occurs either within, or immediately adjacent to the
palindromic sequence (7). Type III R–M enzymes are
tetrameric holoenzymes that possess sequence-speciﬁc
methylation, restriction and DNA dependent nucleoside
triphosphatase activities (5). The sequence recognized
is 5–6 bp in length and cleavage typically occurs
25–27 bp away from, and to one side of the recognition
sequence.
The most complex of the four groups are the type I
enzymes which were the ﬁrst R-M systems discovered
(1). They have since been discovered in a number of
Eubacteria and the Archaeabacteria as well (6). Type I
restriction endonucleases (REs) consist of three diﬀerent
subunits: methylase (M), restriction (R) and speciﬁcity (S)
encoded by the hsdM, -R and -S genes, where hsd=Host
Speciﬁcity for DNA (1). Together, they form an intrigu-
ing, multifunctional complex which can either restrict or
modify DNA. Here, the mode of action of the complex is
dictated by the methylation state of the recognition
sequence (8). A fully methylated site results in no action
being taken and in enzyme dissociation; hemi-methylated
target sequences direct the enzyme into a protective
methylation mode producing fully methylated DNA,
while unmethylated DNA shifts the enzyme into a destruc-
tive (and protective) restriction mode. It is in this protec-
tive mode that type I enzymes restrict foreign DNA and
thereby maintain the integrity of the host genome.

Type I REs are divided into four families designated
IA–ID, based on amino acid conservation, antibody
cross-reactivity and enzymatic properties (1,5). The pro-
totype of family IC is the plasmid-encoded EcoR124I.
This enzyme is unique in its cofactor requirements as
S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is non-essential to the
ATPase and restriction endonuclease activities (9).
Similar to other Type I REs, EcoR124I holoenzyme is a
pentameric complex of three subunits, with a stoichio-
metry of R2:M2:S1 (10,11). HsdS contains two sequence
recognition domains that impart sequence speciﬁcity to
both the methylation and restriction activities of the
holoenzyme. The HsdM subunits methylate adenine
bases within the target sequence (GAAn6RTCG) using
SAM as a donor. The methytransferase (MTase; M2:S1)
is suﬃcient for DNA methylation, acting in catalytic fash-
ion relative to DNA (12). The HsdR subunits contain
the Helicase SuperFamily 2 motifs and endonuclease
active site which impart translocation and restriction
activities to the holoenzyme, respectively (1,13).
To restrict DNA, these 400 kDa complexes ﬁrst rec-
ognize and bind to speciﬁc, non-methylated, bi-partite and
asymmetric DNA sequences embedded within double-
stranded DNA (dsDNA) (14). These sequences consist
of two speciﬁc domains (3–5 bp in length) split by a non-
speciﬁc spacer of deﬁned length (6–8 bp) (2). Once bound
to the target sequence, the enzyme hydrolyzes ATP with
a kcat of 100 000min1, while simultaneously translocat-
ing dsDNA bidirectionally toward the holoenzyme
anchored at the recognition sequence (11,14,15). When
translocation is impeded, typically thousands of base
pairs distant from the recognition sequence, restriction
occurs (14,16–18). Double-stranded DNA cleavage
involves sequential nicking of each strand of the duplex
in close proximity by diametrically opposed R-subunits
(17,19,20). Surprisingly, these enzymes are thought to
remain bound to the nascent cleaved DNA where they
continue to rapidly hydrolyze ATP for several hours
(11,21–23). Thus, they have been viewed as catalytic rela-
tive to ATP but stoichiometric relative to DNA (8,22,23).
That is, each holoenzyme is able to cleave only a single
DNA substrate. This facet of enzyme function has not
been rigorously addressed to date.
The failure to mediate multiple rounds of DNA cleav-
age represents an unusual state of aﬀairs within a cell as
this would result in a series of 5 kB DNA fragments with
a type I RE still bound turning over substantial amounts
of ATP with a kcat of 100 000min
1 (11). This would
require any one of a number of mechanisms to neutralize
these complexes including the action of nucleases, pro-
teases or combinations thereof (1,11). Failure to neutralize
these complexes could potentially deplete the intracellular
ATP pools and ensure the death of a phage-infected cell
(24). Although this would be detrimental to the cell in
question, the remaining uninfected cells in the population
would survive. Since the role of the R–M system is to
protect the host, the persistence of these enzyme–DNA
complexes could be viewed as suicidal. However, restric-
tion proﬁcient hosts do survive infection by unmodiﬁed
phages (1). This suggests that eﬃcient mechanisms are in
place to remove DNA-bound, post-cleavage enzyme or
conceivably that the enzyme may frequently dissociate
into its component parts as a means to control enzyme
function (25,26). Alternatively, Type I REs may release
the DNA following cleavage and act in catalytic fashion
relative to DNA.
To more clearly understand the type I RE cleavage
mechanism, the study of DNA cleavage by EcoR124I
was undertaken. To our surprise, we discovered that con-
trary to the view held for over 35 years, type I RE are not
stoichiometric but are instead catalytic with respect to
DNA. Further, the mechanism involves formation of a
dimer of holoenzymes, with each monomer bound to a
target sequence and, following cleavage, each dissociates
in an intact form to bind and restrict subsequent DNA
molecules. The fact that type I restriction enzymes are
catalytic has broad implications to the in vivo biology
of the R–M enzyme family.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
All chemicals were as described previously (11). ATP (GE
Biosciences) was dissolved in 1M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and
stored as aliquots at 208C. ATPgS (Roche) and ADP
(Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 0.5M Tris–HCl (pH
8.0) just before use. The concentrations of ATP, ATPgS
and ADP were determined spectrophotometrically at
260 nm using e=15400M1 cm1.
Purification of the EcoR124I holoenzyme
EcoR124I was puriﬁed exactly as described (11). The con-
centration of holoenzyme was determined at 280 nm
using e=366 090M1 cm1 (27).
Plasmid DNA
The plasmids used in this study are pDRM.1R (R+;
2891 bp), pDRM.2R (2R+; 2921 bp), pPB67 (R0;
4363 bp), pPB248 (R+; 4266 bp) and pPB455 (R+;
9826 bp). Negatively supercoiled DNA was puriﬁed as
described previously (11). The nucleotide concentration
of DNA was determined at 260 nm using e=
6500M1 cm1. The concentration of DNA in all experi-
ments is reported in nanomolar molecules.
ATPase assay
Hydrolysis of ATP was monitored using a continuous
spectrophotometric ATPase assay (11). Reactions were
done at 258C and contained 20mM Tris–acetate (pH
7.5), 100 mg/ml of BSA, 5% glycerol, 1mM DTT, 1mM
ATP, 5mM Mg(OAc)2, 20U/ml of pyruvate kinase,
20U/ml of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 7.5mM phos-
phoenolpyruvate, 0.3mM NADH, 5nM (-)scDNA (R+;
pDRM.1R or 2R+; pDRM.2R) and EcoR124I as indi-
cated. The analysis of data was exactly as described (11).
DNA cleavage assays
Agarose gel-based assays were used to monitor cleavage of
(-)scDNA by EcoR124I. Reaction conditions (300ml) were
the same as those used for the ATPase assay except LDH
3378 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 10
and NADH were omitted. Assays were done either on ice
(08C), or at 25 or 378C, producing identical results but at
rates corresponding to the reaction temperature (data
not shown). Following DNA cleavage, time points were
stopped by the addition of ﬁcoll gel loading dye (28) con-
taining 0.1% SDS, 10mM EDTA and 0.4mg/ml protein-
ase K (ﬁnal concentrations). Samples were incubated at
room temperature until the last time point was collected,
loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel and subjected to electro-
phoresis in TAE buﬀer (40mM Tris–acetate and 2mM
EDTA) at 700V. h. Gels were stained with ethidium bro-
mide (0.5 mg/ml in dH20) for 1 h and subsequently
destained in dH20 for 20min. Destained gels were photo-
graphed using a DIGI-DOC gel documentation system
(UVP, Inc.) and analyzed using ImageQuant v 5.0 soft-
ware (Molecular Dynamics). To determine the rate of
DNA cleavage, the amount of (-)scDNA present in each
lane was determined using the volume quantitation func-
tion of ImageQuant and expressed as a fraction of the
input amount of DNA substrate. In reactions where the
amount of linear dsDNA was quantitated, the amount
of DNA present is expressed as a fraction of the total
dsDNA present in that lane. For other reactions, the
method of quantitation is indicated in the ﬁgure legend.
Denaturing gel filtration
1.2mg of EcoR124I was mixed with buﬀer A [50mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) and 2mM DTT] containing 0.5 to
6M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) in separate experi-
ments. The protein sample (1ml) was applied to a
Superose 6 column (24ml; Amersham Biosciences) equili-
brated in the buﬀer A containing the same concentrations
of GuHCl. Following chromatography, fractions were
dialyzed against buﬀer A overnight and subjected to elec-
trophoresis in SDS–PAGE gels followed by gel analysis
to evaluate composition. Gels were stained with
either Coomassie brilliant blue or silver (SilverSnap II;
PIERCE) and analyzed using ImageQuant v5.0
(Molecular Dynamics).
Native gel filtration
EcoR124I–DNA complexes (550ml; 38–40 nM DNA,
62–70 nM active enzyme in separate reactions), were
applied to the Superose 6 column equilibrated in buﬀer
B [20mM Tris–HCl (pH7.5), 1mM DTT, 5mM
Mg(OAc)2 and 150mM NaCl]. Thereafter, DNA–protein
complexes were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gels
to ascertain DNA content and cleavage state. Similarly,
fractions from the complex and free protein peaks were
subjected to electrophoresis in SDS–PAGE gels followed
by analysis using ImageQuant to ascertain protein content
and assembly state. Separately, the DNA protein complex
was added to ATPase and DNA cleavage assays.
To determine enzyme assembly state at the mid-point,
the reaction mixture (identical to cleavage assays) was
prepared on ice (08C) and initiated by adding ATP.
After 2min, GuHCl was added to a ﬁnal concentration
of 1M. The reaction mixture was then applied to
the column equilibrated in buﬀer B. For the end-point,
reactions were assembled as above and at t=30min,
the entire reaction was applied to the column. Following
chromatography, fractions were dialyzed and subjected to
electrophoresis separately in agarose and SDS–PAGE gels
followed by analysis.
The mid- and end-points of the reaction were also
subjected to denaturing gel ﬁltration using buﬀer A con-
taining either 0.5 or 1M GuHCl. Following chromatogra-
phy, peak fractions were dialyzed against buﬀer A
and subjected to electrophoresis in both agarose and
SDS–PAGE gels. Positions of migration of all bands
were compared to a molecular weight marker present in
all gels (data not shown).
RESULTS
Definition of terminology used
Before presenting our data and to make the presentation
clear, several deﬁnitions are necessary. For DNA sub-
strates, we will use the designation R0 to indicate DNA
without the target sequence GAAn6RTCG; R
+ to indicate
a substrate with one sequence and 2R+ to indicate DNA
containing two sequences. We deﬁne the EcoR124I holoen-
zyme as a ﬁve subunit or pentameric complex with a sub-
unit stoichiometry of R2M2S1. It follows that a dimer of
holoenzymes is deﬁned as two pentameric complexes or
two, R2M2S1 complexes. The EcoR124I protein used in
all experiments is puriﬁed as the intact holoenzyme with
a subunit stoichiometry of R2M2S1 as demonstrated pre-
viously (11). The total concentration of puriﬁed protein is
measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm and calculated
using the extinction coeﬃcient as described in theMaterials
and Methods section. The fraction of total protein which
is active is termed the ‘active fraction of enzyme’ and is
obtained from the saturation point of ATPase assays
using R+-DNA as described previously (11). In this
work, the level of active enzyme constitutes 22% of the
total protein. The reason for the low level of activity is
unclear, but is addressed in the last section of the Results.
Is EcoR124I catalytic with respect to DNA?
For the past 35 years, type I RE have been thought of
as stoichiometric enzymes. This title has been ascribed to
these proteins because they are only capable of performing
a single round of DNA cleavage. Subsequent cleavage
events, that is multiple rounds of DNA cleavage, were
not thought to occur as the protein remained bound to
the nascent, restricted DNA molecule where it continued
to hydrolyze ATP for several hours (11,21–23). This view
has not been rigorously challenged until now.
To determine whether EcoR124I can act in catalytic
fashion relative to DNA, a sequential DNA-cleavage
assay using two distinct-sized, (-)scDNA substrates was
used and the fate of each DNA determined. We reasoned
that if EcoR124I is catalytic, then addition of the second
(-)scDNA substrate to a completed cleavage reaction
should result in cleavage of that DNA as well. In contrast,
if the protein is not catalytic, then the second DNA would
not be cleaved.
Cleavage assays were done as described in Materials
and Methods section and the results are presented
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 10 3379
in Figure 1. In these experiments, near stoichiometric
ratios of active enzyme to DNA molecules were used
(4.4–5 nM, respectively). In the ﬁrst experiment, the
DNA substrate present in phase I was negatively super-
coiled, R+-DNA 2.9 kB in size and pPB455 (R+-DNA;
9.8 kB) was added as the second DNA at 10min to initiate
phase II. The results show that the ﬁrst DNA was rapidly
and completely cleaved (100% in 5min) and 25% of the
second DNA was cleaved in phase II (Figure 1A).
In the second experiment, 2R+-DNA (2.9 kB) replaced
R+-DNA in phase I, and pPB455 (9.8 kB; R+-DNA) was
added once cleavage of the ﬁrst DNA was complete. In
this experiment the concentration of DNA in phase I is
still 5 nM but the concentration of sites is 10 nM, 2.3-fold
higher than that of active enzyme (4.4 nM). The resulting
agarose gel shows that the 2R+-DNA was rapidly and
completely cleaved in <1min and pPB455 was also eﬃ-
ciently cleaved, proceeding to completion within 10min
following addition (Figure 1B). These results suggest
that EcoR124I functions catalytically with respect to
DNA as both DNA substrates were cleaved in these reac-
tions. Cleavage of the second DNA is not due to an excess
of active enzyme present in the reaction. This follows
because the total concentration of sites in phase II of the
R+-DNA reaction is 10 nM and in the 2R+-DNA reac-
tion it is 15 nM. In the latter case, the ratio of sites to
active enzyme is 3.4 and all of the DNA present was
cleaved. We note that at the same concentration of
active enzyme, the rate of cleavage of 2R+-DNA is
faster than that of R+-DNA. This is an important point
and is addressed in the last section of the Results.
Nucleoside cofactors reduce non-specific DNA binding
by EcoR124I
As the enzyme preparation is 22% active [determined
from the saturation point of ATPase assays using
R+-DNA (11)], there is a signiﬁcant fraction of free
protein that could inﬂuence the outcome of the reactions
presented in the preceding section so as to ‘appear’ cata-
lytic. A model for this was derived from studies using
reconstituted enzyme produced by mixing a several-
fold excess of R-subunits and methyltransferase together
just before use. It proposes that the methyltransferase
(M2S1) loads R-subunits onto the DNA and that
these same R-subunits dissociate frequently into solu-
tion during the course of a reaction. This is followed
by reassociation with methytransferase in solution,
forming additional ‘active’ enzymes that could cleave
subsequent DNA molecules (25,26). Thus the free pro-
tein provides a pool with which R-subunits could con-
tinuously associate to provide the appearance of
catalytic behavior. It is therefore critical to remove
unbound protein to more clearly ascertain whether cata-
lytic function can be ascribed to the DNA-bound holoen-
zyme. To achieve this, we utilized gel ﬁltration and
puriﬁed stoichiometric complexes of the EcoR124I
holoenzyme and R+-DNA.
Control gel ﬁltration experiments were done ﬁrst to
determine whether (-)scDNA, protein and the enzyme–
DNA complex could be well separated from one another.
The results from separate gel ﬁltration runs of DNA and
protein only, show that these components elute at 8.3 and
15.8ml, respectively (Figure 2A, inset). When enzyme–
DNA complexes formed using an excess of active
enzyme relative to sites were subjected to gel ﬁltration,
the resulting proﬁle demonstrated two well separated
peaks. The ﬁrst, larger peak eluted at 7.8ml, while the
second, smaller peak eluted at 15ml (Figure 2A).
Aliquots from resulting fractions from each peak were
subjected to agarose and SDS–PAGE gel analysis to deter-
mine peak composition. The analysis shows that the ﬁrst
peak contained enzyme and DNA, consistent with the
presence of the complex, while the second peak contained
free protein only (data not shown).
Figure 1. EcoR124I cleaves two DNA substrates sequentially. Representative agarose gels from sequential cleavage assays are presented. Reactions
were done at 378C and contained 4.4 nM active EcoR124I holoenzyme and 5 nM DNA (2.9 kB) in phase I. To initiate phase II, 5 nM pPB455 (R+-
DNA; 9.8 kB) was added at t=10min. Following reaction completion, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gels as described in
Materials and Methods section. In (A), the ﬁrst DNA substrate was R+-DNA and in (B), the ﬁrst substrate was 2R+-DNA. The position of
migration of each band was compared to molecular weight markers present in the same gel (data not shown).

Figure 2. The EcoR124I restriction endonuclease is a catalytic enzyme. (A) Gel ﬁltration permits puriﬁcation of the active EcoR124I–DNA complex.
A typical gel ﬁltration elution proﬁle is shown. The binding reaction contained 20 nM molecules of 2R+-DNA and 35 nM active EcoR124I. Peak 1,
the enzyme–DNA complex and peak 2, free protein. The composition of each peak was determined using agarose and SDS–PAGE gels. The height
of the two peaks varied according to the amount of enzyme relative to DNA in the initial binding reaction (data not shown). Inset: separate, gel
ﬁltration traces of (-)scDNA (red) or EcoR124I (blue) only. (B) Analysis of the enzyme–DNA peak following gel ﬁltration reveals a stoichiometric
complex. To determine the identity and composition of each fraction in each peak following gel ﬁltration, samples from gel ﬁltration experiments
shown in (A), were subjected to electrophoresis in either agarose or SDS–PAGE gels (top and bottom panels, respectively). For this experiment, the
binding reaction contained 40 nM sites (2R+-DNA) and 50 nM active enzyme. Each gel was photographed immediately after staining and analyzed
using ImageQuant software. In each gel, the amount of DNA or protein present in each fraction was determined by comparison to a titration of
either DNA or protein present in the same gel (not shown). These amounts were then used to calculate the ratios of enzyme to sites which are
indicated at the bottom of each lane of the SDS–PAGE gel. (C) EcoR124I is catalytic relative to DNA. 2R+–EcoR124I complexes (40 nM sites;
70 nM active enzyme) were puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration, aliquots added to reaction mixtures on ice, transferred to 378C and reactions initiated by
addition of ATP to 1mM, ﬁnal. At t=10min, 5 nM pPB248 [R+; (-)scDNA #2; 4.3 kB] was added and the time course continued. (D) Analysis of
the gel shown in (C). Closed circles, pPB248 (-)scDNA present in phase II. Open symbols are the nascent linear dsDNA product produced in phases
I and II. The analysis is of three separate reactions from separate chromatography runs done on diﬀerent days. Quantitation of (-)scDNA was done
as described in Materials and Methods section. The amount of linear DNA product present in each lane is expressed as a fraction of the amount
present at the 1min time point of each phase. (E) The EcoR124I enzyme can perform multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. Puriﬁed, stoichiometric
2R+–EcoR124I complexes were added to reaction mixtures on ice and increasing amounts of pPB455 ranging from 10 to 69 nM molecules added.
The mix was transferred to 378C and reactions initiated by addition of ATP (1mM, ﬁnal) and allowed to proceed to completion. Thereafter samples
were subjected to electrophoresis in an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed and analyzed using ImageQuant. The total amount
of linear product produced resulting from cleavage of both 2R+-DNA and pPB455 is graphed as a function of the total amount of DNA present in
the reaction.

Restriction enzymes like many sequence speciﬁc
enzymes, bind ﬁrst to non-speciﬁc DNA and then transfer
to the recognition sequence (2,7,29). Therefore, the peak
corresponding to the enzyme–DNA complex in Figure 2A
could contain a mixture of enzyme molecules bound to
both the recognition sequence as well as to non-speciﬁc
DNA. To determine the amount of protein bound to
non-speciﬁc DNA, binding experiments were done using
R0-DNA in the absence of a nucleoside cofactor, and the
enzyme–DNA mix subjected to gel ﬁltration. The proﬁle
demonstrated two well separated peaks as expected,
corresponding to the EcoR124I–DNA complex and free
protein (data not shown). Analysis of SDS–PAGE and
agarose gels of fractions from each peak shows that
71-93% of the protein present is found associated with
R0-DNA (Table 1). Identical results were obtained using
2R+-DNA in the absence of nucleoside (Table 1).
Previous work showed that ATP inﬂuenced the binding
speciﬁcity of EcoK, a type IA enzyme (23). To determine
if nucleoside cofactors aﬀect EcoR124I similarly,
we examined the inﬂuence of ATP, ADP and ATPgS
[a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP for this enzyme,
(data not shown)] on the interaction of the enzyme with
(-)scDNA. The resulting gel ﬁltration elution traces con-
tained two peaks corresponding to the complex and free
protein, respectively (Figure 2A and data not shown).
Analysis of SDS–PAGE and agarose gels shows that in
the presence of ADP or ATPgS, binding to R0-DNA was
reduced to 3% (Table 1). In contrast, 57–70% of the
protein was bound to 2R+-DNA in the presence
of these cofactors. In the presence of ATP, binding to
R0-DNA was reduced 7- to 9-fold to 12%, relative to
nucleoside-free reactions, independent of the metal ion
present. As the combination of Mg2+ ions and ATP
results in cleavage of site-speciﬁc DNA, binding in the
absence of cleavage cannot be observed under these
conditions. Control assays demonstrate that Ca2+ ions
do not support DNA cleavage but do support binding
to DNA (data not shown). Consequently, binding assays
done in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ ions results in 73%
of the protein being bound to 2R+-DNA, 6-fold more
than to R0-DNA (Table 1).
Collectively, these data are consistent with a model sug-
gesting that the aﬃnity of EcoR124I for DNA, like that of
EcoK, is aﬀected by the presence of a nucleoside cofactor
(23). In the absence of nucleoside, aﬃnity for non-speciﬁc
DNA is high, whereas in the presence of nucleoside cofac-
tors, aﬃnity is altered so that preferential binding to target
sequences is facilitated.
EcoR124I is a catalytic enzyme
Using conditions established above, protein–DNA com-
plexes formed on 2R+-DNA in the presence of ADP
and Mg2+ were puriﬁed using gel ﬁltration. Each fraction
of the ﬁrst peak that eluted from the gel ﬁltration column,
that is the protein–DNA complex, was subjected to aga-
rose and SDS–PAGE gel electrophoresis and analysis
to determine the ratio of enzyme to DNA present in
the complex. The analysis of these gels showed that in
the apex fractions, the holoenzyme to site ratio is 1
(Figure 2B).
Then, using the puriﬁed stoichiometric EcoR124I–
DNA complex, we asked is the enzyme catalytic relative
to DNA? To do this, the apex fractions from the complex
peak were added to a reaction mix containing ATP and an
ATP-regenerating system. Once the reaction had pro-
ceeded to completion, a second, distinct-sized R+-DNA
(4.3 kB) was added and the reaction continued. There-
after, time points were subjected to electrophoresis in
agarose gels. The results show that the 2R+-DNA
(2.9 kB) which was present in the enzyme-DNA complex,
was cleaved in <1min (Phase I, Figure 2C). Signiﬁcantly,
the second (-)scDNA substrate was completely cleaved
albeit at a 2-fold reduced rate relative to that of the ﬁrst
DNA (Figure 2C and D). As the only enzyme present in
this reaction was that in the puriﬁed complex, the only
way in which the second DNA could be restricted is if
EcoR124I cleaved the ﬁrst DNA and then transferred
from the nascent linear product DNA to the second
(-)scDNA resulting in its cleavage. Therefore, EcoR124I
is a catalytic enzyme.
Support for enzyme transfer from the linear product is
observed when the level of product DNA is quantitated.
Analysis of the gel in Figure 2C demonstrates that the
nascent linear DNA decreases at a rate of 2.6%/min
during phase I (open squares; Figure 2D). Once the
second DNA is added, the rate of degradation of the
ﬁrst linear product is reduced 4.3-fold during phase II to
0.6%/min (open circles; Figure 2D). This reduction in
cleavage results from EcoR124I transferring from the nas-
cent linear 2R+-DNA to the second (-)scDNA leading
to its cleavage. Transfer from product to subsequent sub-
strate is expected for a catalytic enzyme. We note that
transfer is not 100% since the linear 2R+-DNA product
continues to be degraded. This suggests that the 2R+

aBinding reactions were done as described in Materials and Methods

gel ﬁltration in buﬀer B with Ca(Cl)2 replacing Mg(OAc)2 for binding
reactions done in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Typical elution proﬁles
contained two peaks such as those shown in Figure 3A. Following gel
ﬁltration, peak fractions were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose
and SDS–PAGE gels. The gels were then stained, photographed and
analyzed to determine the amount of DNA or enzyme present in each
fraction. The amount of protein bound is expressed as a percentage of
the total amount of protein detected in the complex and the free
enzyme peaks. For each condition, the data are from a single chroma-
tography run. ND, not done.

substrate is still the favored cleavage substrate with
the linear being further degraded to products of nonspe-
ciﬁc size.
EcoR124I can perform multiple rounds of DNA cleavage
Thus far, we have shown that EcoR124I can cleave two
distinct-sized substrates when added sequentially to an
ongoing reaction. As this was demonstrated using a pur-
iﬁed enzyme–DNA complex that contained 1 holoenzyme
per site, cleavage of the second DNA means that
EcoR124I is by deﬁnition catalytic. It is conceivable how-
ever, that the determination of the holoenzyme to DNA
stoichiometry in the complex may be imprecise and there
is a suﬃcient amount of nonspeciﬁcally bound protein
that transfers from the DNA in the complex to the
second DNA leading to its cleavage. Even though we
have taken great care to accurately determine the ratio
of holoenzyme to sites in the puriﬁed complex, there
may still be a small of amount of nonspeciﬁcally bound
enzyme present that has escaped our detection.
If EcoR124I is truly catalytic however, then it should
be able to cleave increasingly larger amounts of a second
DNA when added to a reaction containing the puriﬁed
EcoR124I–DNA complex. If the apparent catalytic behav-
ior is due to enzyme bound nonspeciﬁcally to the DNA,
then the amount of DNA cleaved will saturate at a level
corresponding to the amount of total enzyme present in
the assay.
To determine which of these possibilities is correct,
complexes containing ADP and 2R+-DNA (2.9 kB)
were puriﬁed and analyzed as before to ascertain the
ratio of enzyme to sites (a ratio of 1 was obtained; data
not shown). Then, aliquots from the peak fractions were
added to separate reaction mixes containing increasing
amounts of pPB455 (R+-DNA; 9.8 kB), ATP and an
ATP-regenerating system. The ﬁnal concentration of
enzyme in each assay was 6.6 nM. The total DNA concen-
tration in each assay ranged from 10 to 70 nM molecules
and consisted of the DNA present in the puriﬁed complex
(3.3 nM) and additional pPB455.
Following DNA cleavage, samples were subjected to
electrophoresis in agarose gels and the resulting gel ana-
lyzed. The results show that as the amount of substrate in
the reaction increased, the amount of linear product
increased as well, with as much as 56 nM being produced
from the reaction containing 70 nM total DNA
(Figure 2E). As the concentration of active EcoR124I
was 6.6 nM, this means that 8.5 catalytic cycles were
observed. As the only protein present in each assay was
that in the puriﬁed complex and the amount of linear
product produced greatly exceeds the amount of
EcoR124I present, each holoenzyme is able to perform
multiple, cleavage events. Therefore, we conclude
EcoR124I is a catalytic RE.
EcoR124I holoenzyme is a stable complex
Previous work using enzyme reconstituted from the
MTase and R-subunits just before use suggests that
EcoR124I is unstable resulting from frequent R-subunit
loss which was observed to occur during the course of
reactions (25,26). These data may have resulted from the
inability to achieve stably reconstituted holoenzyme which
has been demonstrated to require an overnight incubation
(25). Although we have used puriﬁed holoenzyme in
this work, it is conceivable that this pentameric, R2M2S1
complex is itself unstable and may undergo frequent
disassembly during the course of a reaction in a manner
analogous to that observed for the reconstituted com-
plexes. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain whether the
puriﬁed EcoR124I holoenzyme is a stable pentameric
complex. That is, the R2M2S1 complex.
To address this issue, puriﬁed holoenzyme was mixed
with various concentrations of GuHCl ranging from 0.5
to 6M in separate experiments, and subjected to gel ﬁltra-
tion under conditions where the column was equilibrated
in running buﬀer containing the same concentrations
of GuHCl. Then, samples were dialyzed and subjected to
electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE gels followed by analysis
to ascertain the subunit composition of each peak.
Results show that concentrations of GuHCl ranging
from 2 to 6M dissociate the enzyme into its component
subunits producing an elution proﬁle consisting of two
peaks. The ﬁrst contains HsdR, while the second contains
HsdM and S (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 1A).
As the concentration of GuHCl is lowered to 1M and
below, the enzyme elutes as a single peak with an apparent
MW larger than that of the individual subunits alone, sug-
gesting that it is no longer fully dissociated into its com-
ponent subunits (Figure 3A). Gel analysis of the peak
reveals that in 1M GuHCl the enzyme is a mixture of
free M and R subunits (eluting in the leading edge of the
peak), holoenzyme (central fractions) and a complex with
an R1M2S1 subunit ratio eluting in the trailing edge of the
peak (Figure 3B). Loss of one R-subunit from the holoen-
zyme is consistent with previous work showing that the two
R-subunits bind the MTase with diﬀerent aﬃnities (25).
In 0.5M GuHCl, the protein also elutes from the
column as a single peak. However, and in contrast to
what was observed in 1M GuHCl, the enzyme is intact
as densitometry of each gel lane results in an average
R:M:S subunit ratio of 1.7:2.9:1 (Supplementary
Figure 1B). Therefore, as concentrations of GuHCl 
1M are required to completely dissociate the holoenzyme
into its component subunits, we conclude that in the
absence of DNA and ATP, the puriﬁed EcoR124I holoen-
zyme is a stable complex.
Holoenzyme stability is observed during the course of
a reaction
Although the EcoR124I holoenzyme is an intrinsically
stable complex, it is conceivable that during the course
of a reaction it can still dissociate into its component sub-
units and reassociate in solution to form the holoenzyme.
Therefore, we chose two time course checkpoints at which
to measure complex stability and challenged the enzyme
with GuHCl. The mid-point was selected as the enzyme
may disassemble during the course of a reaction. As dis-
sociation may occur once the cleavage reaction has com-
pleted and nascent DNA ends are released, we evaluated
enzyme stability at the reaction end-point as well.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 10 3383
DNA cleavage assays were performed on ice (i.e. 08C)
so that the mid-point could be precisely obtained. At this
temperature, 50% of the (-)scDNA substrate is cleaved in
2min with the reaction completed by 30min (Figure 3C).
Reactions were terminated at the mid-point by the addi-
tion of GuHCl to 1M ﬁnal, and the entire mix subjected
to native gel ﬁltration. As this concentration of GuHCl
partially dissociates the holoenzyme, and if EcoR124I
dissociates during the course of a reaction, the presence
of 1M GuHCl may further destabilize the enzyme, produ-
cing an elevated level of dissociated R-subunit relative
to that shown in Figure 3B. The resulting elution proﬁle
showed two peaks as expected; the ﬁrst contains
DNA only while the second contains protein only (data
not shown). The agarose gel of the ﬁrst peak shows
that 50% of the input DNA was cleaved as expected

(Figure 3D; left panel). Analysis of the protein gel of the
second peak revealed no additional dissociation of the
R-subunit beyond that observed in the absence of DNA
(Figure 3D; right panel; compare to Figure 3B).
Identical experiments were done to ascertain enzyme
stability following reaction completion (i.e. at 30min;
Figure 3C). Thereafter, reaction mixes were loaded
directly onto the column. As for the mid-point, no detect-
able dissociation of the holoenzyme either still bound
to the DNA (peak 1) or free in solution (peak 2), was
observed (Figure 3E, right panel). An additional experi-
ment was done where GuHCl was added to 1M ﬁnal at
30min, and the mixture loaded onto the column. Here,
limited R-subunit dissociation was observed as shown in
Figure 3B and D, and as for the mid-point, there was no
enhancement in R-subunit dissociation relative to that
observed in the absence of DNA and ATP (data not
shown). Thus, within the limits of detection in this
assay, the holoenzyme does not appreciably dissociate
into its component parts during the course of a reaction.
Therefore, we conclude that when puriﬁed as the holoen-
zyme, EcoR124I is a stable, pentameric complex.
EcoR124I is active as a dimer of holoenzymes
To determine the fraction of active enzyme in our protein
preparations, we utilize a coupled, spectrophotometric
ATPase assay, titrate total protein relative to negatively
supercoiled, R+-DNA and measure the initial rates of
ATP hydrolysis (11). The data show that as total protein
concentration increases, the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis
increase accordingly (Figure 4A). As EcoR124I does not
appreciably hydrolyze ATP in the absence of DNA or in
the presence of R0-DNA (11), the increased levels of activ-
ity correlate with occupancy of target sequences by active
holoenzyme present in the total protein population. For
this preparation, the data show that activity saturated at a
concentration of 22.9 nM protein, indicating that 22% of
the protein present was active. This is only marginally
higher than 16% active protein reported previously (11).
The low level of active enzyme is troubling since pre-
parations are >95% homogenous and contain stoichio-
metric ratios of the R-, M- and S-subunits (2:2:1; data
not shown and (11)). The reason for this low level of
active enzyme is unknown. To determine whether addi-
tional factors might be limiting, we repeated the protein
titrations relative to R+-DNA in the presence of diﬀerent
concentrations of Mg[OAc]2 or SAM, in separate experi-
ments. Similarly, we also varied the concentration of
Mg[OAc]2 or SAM while holding the remaining com-
ponents constant. The results show that within experimen-
tal error, the fraction of active enzyme remained
unaﬀected (data not shown). Next, the protein titration
was repeated using negatively supercoiled 2R+-DNA
instead of R+-DNA. We expected that activity would sat-
urate at 46 nM total protein. Surprisingly, saturation was
observed at 22.9 nM protein indicating that the level of
active protein had doubled to 44% (Figure 5A). These
data suggest that EcoR124I functions as a dimer of
holoenzymes consistent with previous predictions for
other Type I enzymes (5,30).
Previous work demonstrated a sigmoid, non-linear
dependence of the rate of DNA cleavage on the concen-
tration of total EcoR124I protein (9). (In this work,
the fraction of active enzyme was not determined.)
These ﬁndings are consistent with the requirement for
dimer formation with the possibility of cooperative pro-
tein-protein interactions being involved. To further inves-
tigate this nonlinear dependence, we varied the active
enzyme concentration from 1 to 8 nM in the presence of
5 nM R+-DNA and measured the reaction rate. A similar,
nonlinear dependence of DNA cleavage rate on enzyme
concentration was observed (data not shown).
To examine the nonlinear dependence more clearly,
we conducted a careful comparison of two concentrations
of active enzyme from the abovementioned titration.
Figure 4. EcoR124I is active as a dimer of holoenzymes. (A) The active fraction of enzyme is inﬂuenced by the number of recognition sites present in
the DNA substrate. A titration of protein relative to (-)scDNA was done as described in Materials and Methods section and the rates of ATP
hydrolysis determined. To accurately determine the intercept for stoichiometry, the lines ﬁt to the data prior to saturation were determined by linear
regression (a minimum of seven data points were used in the ﬁtting to each data set). Each data set is from two separate assays with each assay
containing the alternate concentrations of protein. Circles, R+-DNA; squares, 2R+-DNA. (B) EcoR124I is active as a dimer. The analysis is of
agarose gels from DNA cleavage assays done in the presence of either R+-(squares) or 2R+-DNA (circles). Reactions were done at 08C and
contained 5 nM DNA and EcoR124I at the concentrations shown. The amount of (-)scDNA remaining at each time point is expressed as a fraction
of the input. The data represent three independent time courses done on separate days.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 10 3385
Concentrations of 2.2 and 4.4 nM active enzyme were
chosen, corresponding to 50% saturation and near sat-
uration of the 5 nM R+-DNA substrate (Figure 4A).
DNA cleavage assays were done as described in
Materials and methods section and the analysis of the
resulting gels is shown in Figure 4B.
At 2.2 nM active enzyme, 5 nM DNA was cleaved at a
rate of 0.9%/min with 80% of the input DNA cleaved in
the 90min assay. The kcat for this reaction was determined
to be 0.035min1. When the concentration of active
enzyme was increased to 4.4 nM, the DNA cleavage rate
increased 3.9-fold to 3.6%/min and 100% of the substrate
was cleaved by 40min. The resulting kcat was 0.142min
1,
4-fold higher than the 2.2 nM enzyme reaction.
Next, we repeated the DNA cleavage assay using the
higher concentration of active enzyme (i.e. 4.4 nM),
reduced the number of sites present in the (-)scDNA sub-
strate from two to one while holding the concentration of
DNA molecules constant at 5 nM. We reasoned that if the
enzyme is a dimer, then by placing sites in separate DNA
molecules the probability of forming the dimer should be
reduced and this might be observed as a decreased rate of
cleavage. As anticipated, the results show that R+-DNA
was cleaved at a rate of 0.84%/min, down 4.3-fold com-
pared to the reaction containing 2R+-DNA (Figure 4B).
The nonlinear dependence of the reaction rate on active
enzyme concentration and the quadrupling of the reaction
rate that occurs when either the active enzyme concentra-
tion or the number of sites present in the substrate is
doubled, are consistent with the requirement for dimer
formation. As EcoR124I has no demonstrable activity in
the absence of DNA or in the presence of R0-DNA (11),
these data suggest that the active form of the protein is
a dimer with each holoenzyme simultaneously bound
to DNA containing a recognition sequence. Clearly,
additional work is required to further elucidate dimeriza-
tion. However, these solution results are consistent with
previous work for both EcoR124I and EcoK and with
previous predictions for the dimerization requirement for
type I REs (5,9,30).
DISCUSSION
The primary conclusion of this work is that type I REs are
true enzymes. That is, they act catalytically with respect
to DNA, ATP and SAM. This is the ﬁrst demonstration
of complete catalytic behavior for any type I RE. The data
also show that the active form of EcoR124I is a dimer of
holoenzymes, with each bound to a recognition sequence.
These results go hand-in-hand to explain how these
enzymes function.
For the past 35 years, type I REs have existed as an
enigma (1,5). This view has held as the enzymes bind
to sequence-containing DNA, rapidly hydrolyze ATP,
cleave the dsDNA in cis and then were thought to
remain bound to that same DNA. In this state they
remain as oxymoronic, stoichiometric ‘enzymes’ incapable
of acting on additional DNA molecules.
In this work, we show for the ﬁrst time that type I REs
are instead, true enzymes, functioning catalytically with
respect to DNA. The unequivocal demonstration of this
point required removal of free protein and puriﬁcation of
the holoenzyme bound to ADP and a DNA substrate
containing the recognition sequence. Puriﬁed stoichio-
metric complexes (i.e. 1 holoenzyme per DNA site) were
added to a reaction mix and once cleavage was complete, a
second, distinct-sized R+-DNA was added. The data
show that both DNA substrates were cleaved. As the
only enzyme present was that bound to the DNA in the
complex, and both DNA molecules in the reaction were
cleaved, we conclude that EcoR124I is catalytic relative to
DNA. If the enzyme were stoichiometric, the second DNA
substrate could never be cleaved. To conﬁrm catalytic
function, we added gel ﬁltration-puriﬁed, stoichiometric

nition complex. (3) A second recognition complex binds to the ﬁrst,
forming the active dimer. (4) Rapid ATP hydrolysis coupled to dsDNA

ing producing dsDNA breaks. (6) Holoenzymes dissociate from the

enzyme–DNA complexes to reactions containing increas-
ingly greater amounts of a second DNA (up to a com-
bined total of 70 nM DNA molecules). The data showed
that EcoR124I was able to cleave as much as 80% of the
total DNA, undergoing approximately eight catalytic
cycles. Therefore, we conclude that EcoR124I is indeed
catalytic. Consequently, type I REs are true enzymes.
The catalytic function observed here is not due to fre-
quent disassembly of the EcoR124I holoenzyme into
methyltransferase and R-subunits as proposed previously
from studies using reconstituted enzyme (25,26). This was
demonstrated by challenging the puriﬁed holoenzyme with
increasing concentrations of the denaturant, guanidinium
hydrochloride. The results show that the puriﬁed holoen-
zyme remained intact in up to 0.5M GuHCl and further-
more, complex stability persisted during the course of
reactions. Therefore, any model that attributes subunit
association and dissociation as a means to control
enzyme activity cannot apply to the EcoR124I holoen-
zyme (26). Furthermore, these results indicate that once
EcoR124I has translocated and cleaved one DNA mole-
cule, it transfers as an intact, R2M2S1 entity to subsequent
DNA substrates, leading to their cleavage.
Protein titrations in ATPase assays were used to deter-
mine the level of active protein. In addition to providing
the active stoichiometry, these data demonstrated that
when the number of binding sites in the (-)scDNA sub-
strate was doubled, the fraction of active protein unex-
pectedly doubled as well, suggesting the requirement for
a dimer (Figure 4A). Further investigation of the depen-
dence of DNA cleavage reaction rate on concentration of
active enzyme proved insightful. Initial experiments
revealed a sigmoid, nonlinear dependence of reaction
rate on enzyme concentration, consistent with previous
work from other laboratories (9). Careful analysis in this
work revealed that when the concentration of active
enzyme was doubled in the presence of 2R+-DNA, the
reaction rate quadrupled (Figure 4B). If the enzyme
were active as a monomer (i.e. a single R2M2S1 complex),
then doubling the concentration of enzyme should result
in the reaction rate simply doubling. This is clearly not
what was observed. Instead the results are more complex
and are consistent with the active form of the enzyme
being a dimer of holoenzymes, i.e. two R2M2S1 complexes
with each bound to a recognition site simultaneously.
Each holoenzyme must be bound to a target sequence
simultaneously since no activity is observed in the absence
of DNA or in the presence of R0-DNA (11). The data are
consistent with a previous model suggesting dimerization
is intrinsic to type I RE function (5). Dimerization is not
limited to EcoR124I having been observed for other type I
holoenzymes (17,18,30). For EcoKI, dimerization prior
to the onset of dsDNA translocation was observed using
atomic force microscopy. Although these images were
done in the absence of ATP, dimerization required occu-
pancy of recognition sequences by each multi-subunit
member of the dimer (30). Furthermore, dimerization is
also a requirement for the unusual type II RE, Fok I (31).
Intriguingly, the requirement for a dimer also partially
explains the apparent saturation behaviour observed
in enzyme titrations (Figure 4A). For a stoichiometric
enzyme, increasing the amount of total protein relative
to a ﬁxed amount of substrate yields a linear increase in
activity which saturates when all of the available substrate
is bound. Once saturation is achieved, further increases
in protein do not produce further increases in activity.
This was observed for EcoR124I in both DNA cleavage
(data not shown) and ATPase assays (Figure 4A). It is
now clear that these titrations do not reﬂect true stoichio-
metric behaviour but instead reﬂect the dimerization
requirement and is related to occupancy of recognition
sites. At low concentrations of protein, the probability
of forming a dimer is rare so that very little activity is
observed. As protein concentration increases, the proba-
bility of dimer formation increases and correspondingly,
initial rates of activity do as well. Once all sites are occu-
pied, the probability of dimer formation is maximal and
consequently, reactions rates are as well. Intriguingly,
we consistently observe elevated higher rates of activity
in the presence of 2R+- relative to R+-DNA at the
same concentrations of active enzyme. In fact, the rate
of DNA cleavage is typically 4-fold higher (Figure 4B).
This result is also consistent with the requirement for
dimerization as intra-molecular dimers (i.e. bound to
two sites present on the same DNA) are more likely to
form than inter-molecular ones (i.e. holoenzymes bound
to separate DNA molecules as they would be with single
site-containing DNA).
The requirement for a dimer is not the full story
however. Full catalytic activity (i.e. 100% cleavage of all
available substrate) was only observed for EcoR124I when
an enzyme to DNA ratio of approximately 1 was used
(Figure 1 and data not shown). This is surprising as
an enzyme should be catalytic regardless of protein con-
centration. The failure to observe catalytic function at low
concentrations of protein is readily explained when one
considers that the recognition sequences present in the
substrate are neither destroyed nor inactivated during
the course of a cleavage reaction. Recall that cleavage
by type I enzymes occurs at sites distant from the recog-
nition sequence and not within or immediately adjacent to
the sequence as in the case of type II enzymes (7,16).
Therefore, during the course of a reaction, there is a
constant redistribution of enzyme by the available sites
present in both the substrate and product DNA molecules.
As full cleavage activity requires formation of a dimer
bound to two substrate–DNA target sequences simulta-
neously, the nascent linear DNA product acts as a com-
petitor molecule making it increasingly more diﬃcult
to form the active dimer (i.e. bound to two substrate
DNAs). This competition which increases as the reaction
progresses, results in the appearance of stoichiometric
behaviour. The inability to completely cleave all available
substrate is further complicated by the presence of free
protein, some of which is inactive (the level of inactive
protein is currently unknown). When free protein was
removed by gel ﬁltration, the ‘puriﬁed’ fraction of
enzyme was consistently more active as indicated by
higher rates and extents of reaction compared to the initial
partially active pool of enzyme (data not shown).
The product inhibition model predicts that if the lin-
ear product were removed from the reaction, EcoR124I
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 10 3387
should demonstrate full catalytic function, even at low
concentrations of active enzyme relative to DNA. This
was shown previously in vitro when cleavage assays were
done in the presence of the potent DNA helicase, the
E. coli RecBCD enzyme, which exhibits a >106-fold
higher aﬃnity for linear dsDNA relative to closed circular
forms (32). Here, sub-stoichiometric amounts of
EcoR124I were able to cleave subsequent (-)scDNA sub-
strate molecules added to reactions only when RecBCD
was present but not in its absence (11). The original pur-
pose of the combined EcoR124I-RecBCD assay was to
determine whether EcoR124I released the nascent DNA
ends immediately following DNA cleavage. As RecBCD
was able to rapidly unwind EcoR124I-restricted dsDNA,
we concluded that ends were being released. We then
added a second aliquot of (-)scDNA to this reaction
following the unwinding by RecBCD and found that to
our surprise, it too was restricted and rapidly unwound.
As we were unaware that EcoR124I acted in catalytic
fashion, we proposed that (i) the initial DNA cleavage
event somehow ‘inactivated’ EcoR124I and (ii), displace-
ment by RecBCD then ‘reactivated’ EcoR124I resulting in
cleavage of subsequent DNA molecules (11). We now
know that this was incorrect and the observed eﬀect was
instead due to removal of the competitor, linear product
DNA by RecBCD thereby enabling EcoR124I to facilitate
multiple rounds of DNA cleavage.
These in vitro results are consistent with previous in vivo
data demonstrating a reduction in restriction by EcoKI in
the absence of RecBCD (33). Although the reason for this
was unclear at the time, our data suggest that the reduc-
tion may at least be due in part to the accumulation of
competitor DNA resulting from DNA cleavage by EcoKI.
As RecBCD was unavailable to degrade restricted DNA,
EcoKI could re-bind these DNA molecules and conse-
quently was unable to cleavage additional DNA. In the
presence of RecBCD, the linear DNA is eﬀectively
removed allowing EcoKI to cleave additional DNA.
Further support for the coupling between nucleases and
REs comes from work with R.EcoP151, a type III RE
(34). In the absence of an exonuclease, EcoP15I was
only able to perform a single round of DNA cleavage.
In contrast, in the presence of Exonuclease III,
R.EcoP151 was able to perform multiple rounds of
DNA cleavage. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest
that for enzymes such as type I and III REs that do not
destroy their target sequence during restriction, removal
of the nascent competitor product DNA is a previously
underappreciated and key component of the reaction
pathway. Failure to do so limits the restriction enzyme
to a single round of cleavage whereas the presence of
the exonuclease ensures catalytic function by removal
of inhibitor product DNA.
As EcoR124I is a stable multi-subunit enzyme, the
following catalytic reaction scheme emerges (Figure 5).
The stages up to cleavage of the dsDNA substrate
(excluding conformational changes induced by SAM) are
similar to those proposed previously for EcoK, thus
the scheme presented should apply to all type I enzymes
(8). The intact, monomeric holoenzyme binds ﬁrst to
nonspeciﬁc DNA, forming the initial complex (steps 1
and 2). In the presence of a nucleoside cofactor, the
enzyme transfers to a nonmethylated recognition sequence
embedded within dsDNA, forming the recognition com-
plex (step 3). Transfer may involve hydrolysis of a few
molecules of ATP, since nonspeciﬁc binding is reduced
in the presence of ADP, although more work is required
to elucidate the nucleoside requirement more precisely
(Table 1). Once at the recognition sequence, dimerization
occurs (step 4). This is presented schematically in only one
way for clarity with two, monomeric EcoR124I–DNA
complexes interacting. Alternatively, formation of the
dimer may occur when a second EcoR124I holoenzyme
collides with the ﬁrst already bound to a recognition
sequence. This would then be followed by binding of a
second DNA. Once the complete dimer has formed and,
if the DNA is unmethylated, it is followed by rapid, ATP
hydrolysis-driven dsDNA translocation leading to restric-
tion of the DNA at a position distant from the recognition
sequence (step 5). Immediately thereafter, the intact
holoenzymes transfer from the nascent cleaved DNA to
subsequent DNA molecules (if present), and the process is
repeated (steps 6 and 7). If a second DNA molecule
is absent, the enzymes rebind to the nascent linear DNA
product (which still contains the intact recognition
sequence) and proceed to hydrolyze ATP and nonspeciﬁ-
cally degrade the product to which it has rebound (step 6).
Rebinding to the linear product is reduced once subse-
quent substrate DNA molecules are added to the reaction
(Figure 2D and E). Further support for rebinding of
the product DNA comes from several studies where
post-cleavage, futile cycles of ATP hydrolysis have been
observed to persist for several hours (11,22,35,36).
In addition, a previous characterization of the ATPase
activity of EcoR124I revealed that in the presence of
(-)scDNA, time courses are biphasic with the ﬁrst rapid
phase corresponding to hydrolysis prior to DNA cleavage
and the second 10-fold slower phase corresponding to
post-cleavage hydrolysis (11). When heparin was added
along with ATP following binding of the enzyme to
DNA, the ﬁrst phase of ATP hydrolysis was unaﬀected
while the second phase was eliminated. This occurs
because the enzyme dissociates from the nascent linear
product and binding to additional DNA substrates is
inhibited as the enzyme is sequestered by the heparin.
When heparin is added prior to protein, all type I activities
are inhibited (8,11).
The observation of catalytic function for type I REs
alters the in vivo mechanistic view of these previously enig-
matic enzymes. The idea that these enzymes might remain
bound to restricted phage DNA suggests a requirement
for their rapid removal by either the action of exonu-
cleases such as RecBCD or ExoIII (11,33,34) or by pro-
teases (37–39). Failure to remove type I restriction
enzymes from the DNA using the abovementioned,
ATP-requiring processes either separately, or in combina-
tion, could prove costly to a cell. This follows because the
proliﬁc ATPase activity (kcat=100 000min
1) of these
enzymes could potentially deplete the intracellular ATP
pools leading to cell death as suggested previously (24).
As type I REs release from the DNA following restriction,
these enzymes do not pose a threat to the survival of the
3388 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 10
infected host following restriction of invading DNA.
Instead they utilize a unique reaction mechanism to rec-
ognize and respond to the methylation state of target
sequences embedded within dsDNA and take advantage
of the supply of ATP to rapidly restrict invading DNA to
the beneﬁt of the host. The restricted DNA is a substrate
for exonucleases such as RecBCD and the combined
actions of the R–M and recombination machinery results
in eﬀective annihilation of invading DNA (11,40). This
leaves the catalytic EcoR124I holoenzyme free to act on
subsequent invading DNA molecules in the absence of
competitor, product DNA.
