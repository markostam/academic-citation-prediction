ABSTRACT
A fast and direct method for the monitoring of
enzymatic DNA hydrolysis was developed using
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We incor-
porated the use of a robotic chip-based electrospray
ionization source for increased reproducibility and
throughput. The mass spectrometry method allows
the detection of DNA fragments and intact non-
covalent protein–DNA complexes in a single experi-
ment. We used the method to monitor in real-time
single-stranded (ss) DNA hydrolysis by colicin E9
DNase and to characterize transient non-covalent
E9 DNase–DNA complexes present during the hydro-
lysis reaction. The mass spectra showed that E9
DNase interacts with ssDNA in the absence of a
divalent metal ion, but is strictly dependent on Ni21
or Co21 for ssDNA hydrolysis. We demonstrated that
the sequence selectivity of E9 DNase is dependent
on the ratio protein:ssDNA or the ssDNA concen-
tration and that only 30-hydroxy and 50-phosphate
termini are produced. It was also shown that the
homologous E7 DNase is reactive with Zn21 as trans-
ition metal ion and that this DNase displays a differ-
ent sequence selectivity. The method described is
of general use to analyze the reactivity and specificity
of nucleases.
INTRODUCTION
The detection of DNA fragments resulting from enzymatic
DNA hydrolysis is often carried out using radiolabeled
DNA. In such a sensitive experiment, 32P-end-labeled DNA
substrate is incubated with the hydrolytic enzyme (1–3).
Alternatively, fluorescence techniques using fluorescent
dye–DNA covalent complexes can be used to study DNA
hydrolysis (4–6). Mass spectrometry has also been used in
some studies to analyze DNA and RNA, and to observe the
degradation of antisense oligonucleotides (7–10). The detec-
tion of protein–DNA interactions is often carried out using
DNA foot-printing assays (11) or gel-shift assays (12).
Recently, an electrochemical method was developed to
probe protein–DNA interactions (13). In this approach,
DNA probes are prepared through the chemical bonding of
an oligonucleotide to a polymer film bearing carboxylate
groups. Alternatively, structural biology techniques such as
NMR, X-ray crystallography and more recently native mass
spectrometry are well suited to detect and characterize
protein–DNA complexes. In this paper, we introduce a new
technique to monitor enzymatic DNA hydrolysis by using
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The
method allows the characterization of DNA fragments and
non-covalent protein–DNA complexes in a single experiment.
Since the introduction of the gentle ionization technique of
ESI (14), ESI-MS has been developed into a method that is
well suited to investigate non-covalent interactions between
proteins, and between proteins and ligands. (15–18). By main-
taining non-covalent interactions during the transfer from
solution into gas-phase, direct measurement of the mass of
a complex reveals the identity and stoichiometry of interacting
components. Compared to the total number of publications
describing intact protein complexes, relatively few reports
have described the interactions between proteins and nucleic
acids (19–23). This low number of publications may reflect
practical difficulties when measuring these interactions. These
difficulties include the need for high salt concentrations, the
heterogeneity of oligonucleotides, the binding of cations
to nucleic acids and the possibility to observe non-specific
interactions.

The protein used in this study is the Escherichia coli colicin
E9 DNase. Colicin E9 is a plasmid-encoded protein antibiotic
expressed during times of nutrient or environmental stress
that kills target cells through degradation of bacterial DNA.
In the target cell, the lethal effect is accomplished through the
action of a 15 kDa C-terminal DNase domain, termed colicin
E9 DNase (24). The enzyme is a member of the HNH family of
endonucleases, which are widespread in biology (25), and for
which it is still unclear how they hydrolyze DNA substrates.
Pommer et al. (3) have studied the mechanism and specificity
by which E9 DNase hydrolyzes double-stranded (ds) DNA
using radiolabeled DNA substrates. In their report, it was
shown that, in the presence of the divalent metal ion Mg2+,
E9 DNase preferentially hydrolyzes dsDNA at thymine bases,
produces 30-hydroxy and 50-phosphate DNA termini and does
not cleave smaller substrates, such as dinucleotides. In addi-
tion, they have reported the hydrolysis of a 23mer single-
stranded (ss) DNA by E9 DNase; however, the sequence
selectivity of this reaction was not reported. Ni2+ appeared
to be the most efficient cofactor for ssDNA hydrolysis,
whereas Mg2+ was only a poor cofactor. E9 DNase is thus
a metallo-dependent enzyme, which binds a single divalent
metal ion. Dissociation constants have been determined,
showing a decrease in affinity in the order Zn2+ > Ni2+,
Co2+  Mg2+ (26). The issue of the metal ion as a catalytic
cofactor has proven controversial in the field of colicin DNase
mechanism, with Chak and co-workers (27) reporting that
the homologous E7 DNase (which has an identical HNH
motif to the E9 DNase) is a Zn2+-dependent enzyme.
In recent studies, we have demonstrated by ESI-MS and
other biophysical methods that upon divalent metal ion bind-
ing, the conformation of E9 DNase dramatically shifts from a
rather loosely packed structure into a very compact structure
(28). In addition, we showed that specific phosphate ion bind-
ing to E9 DNase only occurs in the presence of Zn2+ and not in
the presence of Ni2+ or Mg2+ (29). We anticipated that
this finding might also be relevant for the binding of DNA
to E9 DNase.
Here, we describe an ESI-MS method to monitor ssDNA
fragments and non-covalent protein–ssDNA complexes in a
single experiment. For these studies, we used a robotic chip-
based ESI source for increased reproducibility and throughput.
We applied this method to study the ssDNA hydrolysis by
E.coli E9 DNase and E7 DNase. We established that E9 DNase
is strictly Ni2+ or Co2+ dependent, with no reactivity in the
apo-form or in the presence of Zn2+ or Mg2+, has preferred
sites for ssDNA hydrolysis and forms transient protein–
ssDNA complexes during catalysis. In addition, we demon-
strated that E7 DNase has a different cofactor specificity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA hydrolysis
17mer ssDNA (Biolegio, The Netherlands) was mixed with E7
DNase or E9 DNase, and a transition metal ion (Ni2+, Co2+,
Mg2+ or Zn2+) in aqueous 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.7)
to final concentrations of 50–800, 10 and 20 mM for ssDNA,
DNase and metal ion, respectively. The reaction mixtures were
incubated at 20C from 0 up to 120 min. For low concentra-
tions of ssDNA (50–100 mM), the reaction was measured in
real-time by ESI-MS. For high concentrations of ssDNA
(>100 mM), the reaction was stopped at time intervals by
diluting part of the reaction mixture 20- to 40-fold using aque-
ous 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.7 and rapid freezing.
The reaction mixture was then analyzed by ESI-MS. The
sequence of the ssDNA used was 50-GTAAAACGACGGC-
CAGT-30 and did not contain phosphate moieties at the 50- and
30-termini. The average molecular masses of the ssDNA, E9
DNase and E7 DNase as measured by ESI-MS was 5228.3,
15 087.1 and 15 375.5 Da, which is in close agreement
with the calculated average masses of 5228.5, 15 088.0 and
15 374.4 Da. E7 DNase and E9 DNase were purified accord-
ing to a previously established method (30). Metal-free apo-
DNase was produced by EDTA treatment and extensive
dialysis as described before (26). Protein concentrations
were determined by absorbance at 280 nm (31).
Mass spectrometry
A Micromass ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (LCT, Waters)
equipped with a robotic chip-based ESI source (Nanomate,
Advion Biosciences) was used. The ESI source was program-
med to aspirate 2 ml of sample into the conductive pipette tip
and then to deliver the sample to the inlet side of the ESI chip.
This chip consists of 10 · 10 nozzles in a silicon wafer and a
channel extends from the nozzle to an inlet side at the opposite
face of the chip. Electrospray is initiated by applying an elec-
tric voltage of 1850 V and a head pressure of 0.2 psi to the
sample in the pipette tip and a cone voltage of 30 V. All
samples were measured in positive ion mode. The real-time
samples were measured continuously for 45 min, whereas the
other samples were measured for 2 min with a 2 s scan time.
Repeating the experiments with standard borosilicate capillar-
ies instead of the automated ESI source did not alter the
outcome of the experiments.
Data analysis
We semi-quantified our data to determine the initial reaction
velocity and to determine the concentrations of ssDNA frag-
ments formed. We determined that the total ion intensity of a
ssDNA fragment is linearly dependent on the concentration of
ssDNA up to 75 mM. To correct for the discrimination factor of
large ssDNA fragments, we focused on the conditions in which
only one hydrolysis reaction occurred (Equation 1). The mass
spectra showed that up to 240 min only two ssDNA fragments
were formed (F1 and F2), which consequently must have
identical concentrations (Equation 2). The total concentration
of DNA during the reaction was constant (Equation 3). Mass
spectra were averaged over 2 min for better signal-to-noise
ratio, smoothed and centered, thereby using the areas option in
MassLynx 4.0. The total areas were divided by the molecular
masses of the ssDNA fragments (964.6 and 4281.9 Da,
respectively) after which the intensity of the overestimated
small ssDNA fragment was corrected with a normalizing
factor R (R = 2.5) (Equation 4). This, together with the cal-
ibration curve of 17mer ssDNA, allowed us to calculate the
concentrations of the ssDNA fragments formed (Equation 3).
The molecular mass and normalizing factor were used to
calculate the concentrations after 240 min of reaction. This
procedure was also used to calculate ssDNA concentrations
for reactions in which multiple hydrolysis reactions occurred.
e96 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 10 PAGE 2 OF 7
For this, we divided the ssDNA fragments formed into two
classes, namely 3–7 nucleic acids (F1) and 10–14 nucleic acids
(F2). Only F1 was corrected with the factor R. According to the
calculated total intensities, our error using this procedure is
20%. We validated our data with synthetic oligonucleotides
having 4, 11 and 17 nucleic acids.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
E9 DNase–ssDNA complexes
We first examined the ability of E9 DNase to interact with a
17mer ssDNA (50-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-30). When
we incubated E9 DNase (10 mM) with a 10-fold excess of
ssDNA, we only observed ion series of free ssDNA and a
stoichiometric non-covalent E9 DNase–DNA complex having
molecular masses of 5228.3 Da and 20 313.6 Da, respectively.
Similarly, when we added a 10-fold excess of Mg2+ to this
mixture, we only observed a binary E9 DNase–DNA complex.
On the other hand, when we added a 2-fold excess of Zn2+,
Ni2+ or Co2+ we primarily observed the ternary complex
between E9 DNase, 17mer ssDNA and the transition metal
ion having a measured molecular mass of 20 379.6, 20 375.6
and 20 375.1 Da, respectively (Figure 1). The ESI-MS method
thus allows the analysis and characterization of non-covalent
protein–DNA interactions and can easily discriminate between
apo-protein and metal-bound protein having average mass
differences of 65, 59 and 59 Da for Zn2+, Ni2+ and Co2+,
respectively. These results also demonstrate that a divalent
metal ion is not required for ssDNA binding to E9 DNase.
This is in line with data of the homologous E7 DNase for
which it has been demonstrated that it can interact with
27mer dsDNA in the absence of any transition metal ion (27).
The spectra of the binary E9 DNase–ssDNA and ternary E9
DNase–Zn2+–ssDNA complexes did not change in time. Even
at long incubation times (120 min), no other protein–DNA
complexes were detected in the mass spectra. The ternary
complex comprising the metal ion Ni2+ or Co2+, however,
did degrade in time. After 10 min of incubation, the intensity
of the original ternary complex was decreased and other
complexes with lower molecular masses appeared (Figure 1),
indicating the enzymatic hydrolysis of ssDNA.
ssDNA hydrolysis by E9 DNase
The results described in the previous section encouraged us to
monitor in real-time the Ni2+-induced hydrolysis of the 17mer
ssDNA substrate. At first, the concentrations of E9 DNase
(10 mM) and ssDNA (50 mM) were chosen such that we
could monitor online both the ssDNA fragments produced
and the protein–ssDNA complexes present during the hydro-
lysis reaction. Within 45 min, the full-length 17mer ssDNA
was nearly completely hydrolyzed as can be seen from the low
intensities of the ions of the free 17mer ssDNA (m/z 1308.2,
4+; m/z 1 743.9, 3+) and the E9 DNase: Ni2+–17mer ssDNA
complex (m/z 2 265.1, 9+; m/z 2548.1, 8+) in Figure 2. A listing
of all detected ion signals of ssDNA fragments and non-
covalent E9 DNase–ssDNA complexes, their molecular
masses and assignments is given in Table 1. We could assign
peaks corresponding to 14 different DNA fragmentation
products. The determined molecular masses of the DNA frag-
ments allowed us to conclude that all hydrolysis products
contain exclusively 50-phosphate and 30-hydroxy termini,
which is in line with the data of Pommer et al. (3), albeit
for dsDNA. We found fragments with both intact 30 and

with hydrolyzed ssDNA contained a phosphate moiety at the 50 terminus of
the ssDNA. The inset in (B) shows the raw data of the 9+ ion of E9 DNase in
complex with Zn2+ and 17mer ssDNA. The low amount of the complex between
E9 DNase and the two molecules of Zn2+ is indicated by the peak labeled with
the asterisk. These data show that the E9 DNase–Zn2+ interaction is specific.

50 ends and we found exclusively pairs of DNA fragments, i.e.
when we detected ions of 50-AGT-30 (abbreviated here as 3-30;
three nucleic acids long and intact 30-terminus present) we also
detected ions of 50-GTAAAACGACGGCC-30 (50-14; 14 nuc-
leic acids long and intact 50-terminus present), together form-
ing the 17mer ssDNA substrate (Table 1).
The same incubation in the presence of Zn2+ or Mg2+
instead of Ni2+ or in the absence of any transition metal ion
did not yield any hydrolyzed DNA fragments of other protein–
ssDNA complexes. This clearly shows that the reaction
observed in the presence of Ni2+ is an enzymatic reaction
catalyzed by the non-covalent E9 DNase–Ni2+ complex.
These results are in line with previous data, indicating that
hydrolysis of ssDNA is not supported by Zn2+, and that only a
very weak activity is associated with Mg2+ (3).
E9 DNase–ssDNA complexes during hydrolysis
The mass spectra in Figure 2 also show ions around m/z 2000–
2600. Mass determination revealed that these ions represent
the 8+ and 9+ ions of complexes between E9 DNase, Ni2+ and
hydrolyzed ssDNA fragments. These DNA fragments ranged
in size in between 11 and 14 nucleic acids (Table 1), with the
E9 DNase–Ni2+-13-30 complex being the most abundant.
Intriguingly, we only observed non-covalent complexes
between E9 DNase and 50 end hydrolyzed DNA fragments,
e.g. 13-30 (Figure 2). Thus, in spite of the fact that
E9-catalyzed hydrolysis yielded fragments with both intact
30 and 50 ends (Table 1), only non-covalent complexes with
50 end hydrolyzed DNA fragments were stable enough to be
observed. In addition, short DNA fragments (<10 nucleic
acids) did not form stable complexes with the enzyme. This
agrees with previous data that have demonstrated that ssDNA
length was the predominant factor for binding to E9 DNase,
with >10 nucleic acids being optimal (3). The observation that
all 30 and short 50 end hydrolyzed DNA fragments did not form
stable complexes with E9 DNase may also suggest that they
were not further hydrolyzed. Indeed, the mass spectra of the
online kinetic measurements of 17mer ssDNA hydrolysis
showed that the concentration of the 30 and short 50 end hydro-
lyzed DNA fragments remained constant or increased during
the course of the E9 DNase-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions,
whereas the concentration of long 50 end hydrolyzed fragments
decreased (Table 2).
Sequence selectivity of E9 DNase
The previous data may suggest that ssDNA hydrolysis by E9
DNase is either somewhat specific for length or specific for
hydrolysis in between cytosine and adenine bases, however,
some other cleavages occur as well, but at a lower frequency
(Table 2). We extended our kinetic experiments with a molar
ratio protein:DNA of 1:80. Intriguingly, the resulting mass
spectra of these incubations revealed a single cleavage site
forming two fragmentation products, namely 3-30 (m/z 965.4,
1+; m/z 483.2, 2+) and 50-14 (m/z 1428.3, 3+; m/z 1072.0, 4+).
Thus, under these conditions, E9 DNase is much more (length

or base) specific for the hydrolysis in between cytosine14 and
adenine15. In Figure 3, the time-dependent concentration of
the 17mer ssDNA and the two fragmentation products is plot-
ted. From this kinetic plot, we could estimate an apparent
turnover rate of 0.71 – 0.10 min1. In the initial phase of
the reaction, the 14mer degradation product was not further
hydrolyzed by E9 DNase as was indicated by equal concen-
trations of 3-30 and 50-14. Only when the concentration of the
initial 17mer ssDNA was lower than that of the 50-14 fragment
(after 240 min), E9 DNase hydrolysis of the latter fragment
became apparent. This hydrolysis was indicated by the relat-
ively lower concentration of the 50-14 fragment in comparison
with the 3-30 fragment and the occurrence of additional low
abundant fragmentation products.
The results show that the sequence selectivity of the enzyme
is dependent on the protein:DNA ratio or DNA concentration.
Very few examples are described in literature describing such
a phenomenon. Zambianchi et al. (32) reported the effect of
substrate concentration on the stereospecificity of cyclohex-
anone monooxygenase. They have proposed a model in which
the increased stereospecificity is due to the binding of a second
substrate molecule to the protein. Our mass spectrometry
experiments, performed in both positive and negative ion
mode, did not show the interaction with a second molecule
of DNA. However, we cannot completely exclude that a
second low affinity site for DNA is not observed by ESI-
MS, i.e. the affinity might be too low to be observed by
ESI-MS.
ssDNA hydrolysis by E7 DNase
We also used our mass spectrometry method to investigate the
metal-dependency and the sequence selectivity of colicin E7
DNase. Upon mixing E7 DNase (10 mM) with a 50-fold excess
of 17mer ssDNA (50-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-30) and a
stoichiometric amount of Ni2+ or Zn2+, we only observed
binary complexes between E7 DNase and ssDNA. Both in
the presence of Ni2+ and Zn 2+, the binary complexes were
degraded in time, indicating the hydrolysis of ssDNA. The
mass spectra of the incubation in the presence of Ni2+ or
Zn2+ clearly showed a single cleavage site with the formation
of two fragmentation products, namely 4-30 (m/z 772.1, 2+) and
50-13 (m/z 1235.2, 3+) (Figure 4). However, the turnover rate
with Zn2+ was 20-fold lower as compared to the rate with
Ni2+. As discussed before in this paper, the issue of the trans-
ition metal ion as a catalytic cofactor is still under debate in the
field of colicin DNases. The present results clearly demon-
strate that E7 DNase and E9 DNase show a different reactivity
toward transition metal ions. Moreover, E7 DNase and E9
DNase have different cleavage specificities toward ssDNA.
These differences are remarkable as E7 DNase and E9
DNase have very similar primary sequences (70% sequence
identity) and very homologous X-ray structures (root mean
square deviation of 0.65 s for 131 Ca atoms). In addition, the
active site cavities of E7 DNase and E9 DNase are highly
conserved and have >80% primary sequence identity. In pre-
vious work, Kleanthous and co-workers did not find any Zn2+-
dependent activity for E7 DNase. The Kunitz assays used in
these studies may not have sufficient sensitivity to detect such
activity (33,34) or the high Zn2+ concentrations used may have
inhibited the enzyme as has been reported previously (27).
CONCLUSIONS
The results reported here clearly show that ESI-MS is a very
powerful technique to study kinetics and sequence selectivity
of enzymatic DNA hydrolysis, and to analyze transiently pre-
sent protein–DNA complexes. In comparison with the meth-
ods using 32P-end-labeled or fluorescent dye-labeled DNA to
study DNA hydrolysis, the described ESI-MS method is faster
and does not require any DNA manipulation or modification.

complexes, the current method allows full characterization of
the complexes and is faster. Moreover, the ESI-MS method
allows the simultaneous identification of DNA fragments and
non-covalent protein–DNA complexes. The detection limit for
ssDNA and protein–ssDNA complexes in our current set-up is
200 fmol and 1 pmol, respectively. From the results in this
paper, we can conclude that the described method is a general
tool to study the reactivity and specificity of nucleases.
Detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies of the DNA hydro-
lysis by different DNases and varying nucleic acid substrates,
including ssDNA, dsDNA and RNA are currently ongoing in
our laboratory.
