ABSTRACT
The progression of a normal cell to senescence in vivo
and in vitro is accompanied by a reduction in the
length of the telomeres, the chromosome capping
segments at the end of each linkage group. How-
ever, overexpression of the reverse transcriptase
subunit (HTERT) of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase
restores telomere length and delays cellular senes-
cence. Although some data exist in the literature
with respect to survival, no molecular data have
shown that DNA repair in telomerase-immortalized
cells is normal. Several telomerase-immortalized
human skin fibroblast cell lines were constructed
from a primary human fibroblast cell line. The pri-
mary line and the telomerase-immortalized cell lines
were treated with either ultraviolet (UV) radiation
or dimethylsulfate (DMS). UV radiation principally
produces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that are
repaired by nucleotide excision repair, whereas
DMS introduces mainly N-methylpurines repaired
by base excision repair. Here, we show that repair
of both types of damage in the telomerase-
immortalized human skin fibroblast cell lines is ident-
ical to repair observed in normal skin fibroblasts.
Thus, telomerase expression and consequent immor-
talization of skin fibroblasts do not alter nucleotide or
base excision repair in human cells.
INTRODUCTION
Common to all eukaryotes, telomeres consist of repeated hex-
amers of the sequence TTAGGG/CCCTAA, which terminate
the DNA strands at the ends of chromosomes (1). Repeats of
15 kb are considered long and can shorten to 5 kb in senescent
and geriatric cells. Telomeres of chromosomes in normally
proliferating cell populations, such as keratinocytes and lym-
phocytes, are maintained at 10–12 kb, but shorten with each
population doubling in cell culture as a predicted consequence
of replication at DNA ends and the lack of telomerase expres-
sion in normal cells (2–6). Expression of the human telom-
erase reverse transcriptase (HTERT) subunit of the telomerase
holoenzyme is necessary to maintain telomere length (7).
Transfection of normal cells by constructs expressing HTERT
results in telomere lengthening and an increased in vitro life
span (8–11). Telomerase also has a role in tumorigenesis (12).
Cancers and cancer cell lines in many cases express HTERT at
high levels compared with their non-malignant progenitors
(11,13–18). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomere mainten-
ance is dependent on the activities associated with repair of
double-strand breaks (19). Telomerase is thus associated with
telomere maintenance, DNA repair functions and cellular
transformation.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is often considered one of the
most wide spread carcinogens. The repair of UV damage by
the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system has been char-
acterized and many aspects of this repair at the molecular level
are understood, including the proteins involved in recognition,
elimination and re-synthesis. Moreover, the use of other
DNA repair techniques has helped elucidate details about
the process of eliminating damage from DNA. One technique
in particular, ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR), has provided
information at nucleotide resolution about the process of NER
(20,21). LMPCR monitors ligatable 50 phosphate strand
breaks. Strand breaks with ligatable phosphate ends can be
induced by either chemical or enzymatic reactions, but much
less background is introduced if enzymatic means are
employed to produce the sites (22–27). The most widely
used enzymes to induce abasic sites or strand breaks appro-
priate for LMPCR are DNA glycosylases (28–34). NER of
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) is sequence context
dependent and the 50 limit of transcription coupling in
human genes has been identified (21). Other details of NER

and links to human disease have been elucidated using
LMPCR (20,35,36). In these studies, it has proven a valuable
technique in examining repair at nucleotide resolution in
human cells.
Damage inflicted by DNA methylating agents is repaired by
base excision repair (BER) and also, to some extent, by NER
(37). The series of steps involved in the removal of 7-meG
and 3-meA were once thought to occur exclusively by BER,
but their repair is now known to involve NER (37–40). Only
limited data exist on the repair of dimethylsulfate (DMS)
damage by BER at nucleotide resolution in human cells using
LMPCR (41). Although there is a sequence context-dependent
repair of 7-meG and 3-meA, 3-meA is generally repaired faster
than 7-meG. In contrast to NER, repair of alkylated bases
in transcribed genes occurs without any strand bias (41–43).
Despite the contribution of NER to repair of N-methylpurines,
the major repair of at least 3-meA is via BER. Therefore,
measuring the repair of N-methylpurines reflects the BER
capacity.
As a part of our characterization of telomerase-transformed
human skin fibroblasts, we examined UVC repair patterns
at global, strand and nucleotide levels to determine whether
the expression of HTERT alters NER or BER in such cells.
In previous work, HTERT overexpression has been shown
to immortalize human skin fibroblasts and skin fibroblasts
from individuals suffering from the heritable human disease
xeroderma pigmentosum (8,10). Persons with xeroderma
pigmentosum are hypersensitive to UV radiation. HTERT-
immortalized cell lines from both normal individuals and
xeroderma pigmentosum individuals maintain the same UV
sensitivity and unscheduled DNA synthesis as the non-
immortalized counterpart lines (10), but unscheduled DNA
synthesis and survival are indirect measures of the repair
of DNA adducts. A recent report has examined telomerase-
transformed oral fibroblasts (44). A number of assays for
repair were also performed to indicate that repair is faster
in oral fibroblasts expressing telomerase. A single assay
based on strand-specific repair indicated that there was at
least a slight preference for repair of UV damage. It is possible
that the repair at various levels is different in telomerase-
immortalized versus primary cell lines. In this paper, we stud-
ied the repair of CPDs and methylpurines in three different
clones overexpressing telomerase in diploid human skin
fibroblasts. In contrast to the telomerase-immortalized oral
fibroblasts (44), we found that telomerase immortalization
of skin fibroblasts did not alter DNA repair patterns at any
level after UV or DMS exposure at global or nucleotide
resolution. Thus, the use of telomerase-immortalized cells is
a practical model for the study of NER and BER of DMS
damage in human cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enzymes and chemicals
Enzymes including bacteriophage T4 UV endonuclease V,
Escherichia coli DNA photolyase, AlkA and Pfu DNA
polymerase were from laboratory stocks. DNA ligase was
obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and used according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. DMS was from Sigma
(St Louis, MO).
Cell culture
Human foreskin fibroblasts isolated in our laboratory, HF57, or
telomerase-immortalized equivalents, HTERTG, were grown
in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum and maintained in standard
cell culture conditions. Cultures were split at ratios of 1:4, fed
every 2 days and passaged with trypsin/EDTA. Five million
log-phase HF57 p8 cells were used for each electroporation
(BioRad), in Schultz buffer (45) with 5–50 mg linearized
pBABEHYGRO-HTERT (a gift from Dr Robert Weinberg),
450 V DC, 960 mF and 400 ml volume. Following electropora-
tion, cells were returned to a 10 cm culture dish. After 48 h,
cultures were treated with 20 mg/ml Hygromycin B for 3 days,
followed by 2 weeks recovery. Three bouts of Hygromycin B
selection were conducted throughout 5 weeks. Many positive
Hygromycin B-resistant clones formed, but only five were
positive by RT–PCR for telomerase expression. Individual
clones were grown and used in these experiments. The lines
HTERTB, HTERTC and HTERTG have been grown to
passage 21 in the absence of selection and all three lines
overexpressed the HTERT cDNA.
Cytogenetics
Late log-phase cultures were used for standard chromosome
preparation (46). Metaphase chromosomes were counted and
evaluated by GTG banding (46,47). One hundred metaphases
of HF57 and its telomerase-transformed derivative, HTERTG,
were counted.
Survival curves
HF57 or HTERTG cells were treated with either a germicidal
lamp with different fluxes of UV radiation measured at 254 nm
or different concentrations of DMS with 2–3 · 105 cells on
a 150 mm plate (treatments are described below). Following
treatment, the cells were incubated for 48 h, harvested and
counted for trypan blue exclusion using a hemacytometer.
Determinations were conducted in quadruplicate.
Repair of UV damage
For UV treatment, 15 cm plates of mitotically active fibro-
blasts at 90–95% confluence were washed with isotonic saline
and covered with a sterile steel pan. The germicidal lamp was
warmed up for 2 min and the covering pan was removed to
expose the cells. Desired exposure time was calculated to
deliver 20 J/m2 at 254 nm using a UVX monitor (UVP,
Upland, CA). Cells were fed culture medium and incubated
for 0–48 h to allow DNA repair. At various time points, the
cells were harvested.
Repair of DMS damage
For DMS treatment, 15 cm plates of HF57 or telomerase-
immortalized human skin fibroblasts were washed with isotonic
saline and the cells were treated with 1 mM DMS in DMEM
medium without serum for 15 min at room temperature. Cells
were fed culture medium and allowed to repair DNA damage
for 0–72 h. At various time points, the cells were harvested.
Isolation of DNA
At different time points following UVC irradiation or DMS
treatment, the cells were harvested by mild trypsinization.

Nuclei were prepared using a standard protocol (41). Briefly,
the cytoplasm and intact nuclei were centrifuged for 15 min at
4C at 3000 r.p.m. in an SS38 rotor. Nuclei were re-suspended
in a standard buffer and lysed by treatment with Proteinase K
and RNase A for 3–5 h at 37C. The digested nuclei were
extracted twice with each of the following solvents: buffer-
equilibrated phenol, phenol:chloroform (1:1) and chloroform.
Following the last extraction, the DNA was precipitated with
ethanol, washed with 80% ethanol and re-suspended in 1 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA. DNA was quantified using
the absorbance at 260 nm.
Isolation of RNA and RT–PCR assay for
HTERT expression
The supernatant or cytoplasmic fraction with the total RNA
was isolated from cells cultured in 100 mm Petri dishes using
RNAZol as recommended by the manufacturer and stored at
80C in deionized distilled water (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friends-
wood, TX). Following addition of chloroform, the solution
was centrifuged and the supernatant was transferred to a new
Eppendorf tube. The RNA was precipitated using isopropanol
and re-suspended in 0.1· TE with 0.5 U of RNase inhibitor.
RNA was quantified using the absorbance at 260 nm.
The primers used for RT–PCR are as follows: HTERT,
TGACACCTCACCTCACCCAC and CACTGTCTTCCGC-
AAGTTCAC; and for the GAPDH control, CGGAGTCAAC-
GGATTTGGTCGTAT and AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTG-
AAGAC. RT–PCR was performed using a kit obtained from
Invitrogen using MMLV reverse transcriptase (San Diego,
CA). Amplification was performed for 30 cycles with an initial
denaturation of 4 min at 94C, followed by cycles with subse-
quent denaturation for 30 s at 94C, annealing of 40 s at 52C
and extension of 40 s at 72C. Products were separated using
1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Cleavage of DNA at CPDs
DNA (10 mg) from UV-treated cells was reacted with T4 UV
endonuclease V followed by photoreactivation of the
adducts using E.coli photolyase. T4 UV endonuclease V and
photolyase-treated samples were electrophoresed on an alkal-
ine agarose gel and analyzed for global DNA repair using a
FluoroImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) with
ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).
Briefly, each lane of the denaturing agarose gel FluoroImager
scan was divided into 100 boxes using ImageQuant software.
A linear background function was used to subtract background.
The molecular weight standards were plotted and fit using a
polynomial function to convert each of the 100 boxes into a
molecular weight. The volume function of ImageQuant was
used to determine the contribution of each box to the weight
average molecular weight, Mw. The fraction of the contribu-
tion of each of the boxes to the overall molecular weight was
determined. The number of breaks found in genomic DNA can
be calculated from the reciprocal of the Mw.
Cleavage of DNA at N-methylpurines
DNA (10 mg) from UV-treated cells was reacted with 1 mg of
methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG) for 30 min at 37C
followed by cleavage at damage sites by treatment with alkali
at 37C. An aliquot of 100 ml of 2 M piperidine was added to
the MPG-treated DNA at the end of the 30 min enzymatic
reaction, and the incubation continued at 37C for 15 min
to induce breaks at abasic sites via b-elimination, to leave a
ligatable phosphate end for LMPCR analysis. The MPG/mild
piperidine-treated DMS-modified DNA was supplemented
to a final concentration of 0.3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of
20 mg/ml glycogen was added. The DNA was ethanol precip-
itated, washed using 80% ethanol, and the excess piperidine
removed by evaporation. DNA was re-suspended in 1 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA, separated using an alkaline
agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed for global DNA
repair using a FluoroImager with ImageQuant software as
for the UVC-treated DNA.
LMPCR
LMPCR was performed using a protocol employing Pfu Turbo
DNA polymerase that efficiently amplifies 0.5 mg of DNA in
a 10 ml volume (48,49). Labeling of the sample was accomp-
lished using near infrared dyes as described previously. Quan-
tification of bands was performed using ImageQuant software.
Calculated strand-specific repair analysis
The rate of repair to 50% of the initial CPD damage at indi-
vidual base positions in exons 5–8 of the human P53 gene was
determined using LMPCR. The repair rates were summed for
each strand and divided by the number of bases with CPD
damage analyzed on each strand. This average repair rate to
50% repair was used as the repair rate on each strand.
Telomere length assay
Average telomere length was determined using a commercial
system from BD Pharmingen. Briefly, control genomic DNA
is digested with restriction endonucleases, which degrade all
DNA except the telomere repeat sequences (TTAGGG). DNA
was electrophoresed, blotted to a charged nylon membrane
and probed with biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary
to the telomere repeat. Detection was accomplished with a
strepavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugate, which cleaves
a substrate producing light at 410 nm. The membrane was
exposed to X-ray film.
RESULTS
Telomerase-transformed HTERTG human skin
fibroblasts have the characteristics of early
passage normal human skin fibroblasts
Normal human skin fibroblasts (designated HF57) at passage 8
prepared in this laboratory were transformed using electro-
poration with pBABE-Hygro containing the complete HTERT
cDNA. The HTERT cDNA was expressed in the transformed
cells at levels approaching that of the HTERT in HL60 cells
used as a control (Figure 1a). The population doubling time
from 11 independent experiments for HTERTG was 0.47– 0.08
population doubling/day and 0.38 – 0.15 population doub-
lings/day for HF57 cells. Based on the error, the doubling
times of the HF57 and HTERTG are not significantly different.
The normal (HF57) and telomerase-transformed (HTERTG)
human skin fibroblasts were cytogenetically evaluated at vari-
ous passage levels. This shift in telomere length from 5.7 to

7 kb is indicative of an increased expression of the HTERT as
demonstrated in Figure 1b. To characterize the HTERTG cell
line further, chromosome counts of at least 100 metaphases
were made for each cell line, and both showed 2N = 46 (90%)
and 4n = 92 (10%). No aneuploidy was observed. GTG band-
ing was performed, and chromosomes of each cell line exhib-
ited normal banding patterns to a resolution level of 400 bands
per haploid genome. In culture, both HF57 and HTERTG cell
lines exhibited contact inhibition at confluence and did not
form mounds or foci.
Normal diploid skin fibroblasts express a senescent pheno-
type by passage 30 in our hands. HTERTG cells were derived
by electroporation from HF57 at passage 8, selected with
Hygromycin B, allowed to clone for 5 weeks and were then
grown to passage 20. If we assume, conservatively, that
the cells experience 2 population doubling/passage, then
since selection, the HTERTG population has undergone 240
population doublings. The population doublings during selec-
tion are not calculable, but must be significant. Thus, the sum
of the population doubling level of the parental line at elec-
troporation plus the cumulative population doubling level of
the HTERTG line after selection and growth has exceeded the
Hayflick senescence limit (50). Other cell lines expressing
telomerase (HTERTB and HTERTC) were also characterized
with similar properties.
Survival of normal human fibroblasts and
HTERT-immortalized fibroblasts to UV and DMS
To determine whether there is an advantage of either the
normal human fibroblasts or HTERT-immortalized fibro-
blasts following exposure to UV or DMS, we constructed
survival curves (Figure 2). The survival with respect to UV
for HF57 and HTERTG is identical (Figure 2a), showing that

no advantage with respect to survival is conferred on the
HTERT-immortalized fibroblasts. Similarly, survival with
respect to DMS for both HF57 and HTERTG is within the
experimental error (Figure 2b). It should also be noted that the
survival curves were determined using the 48 h controls. Cells
that are untreated do not undergo replication arrest and at 48 h
approximately double in number compared with the initial
seeding. When exposed to even low levels of UV or DMS
(even 5 J/m2 UV or 200 mM DMS), no mitosis is observed
within 30 min post-treatment even at low levels of DNA-
damaging agents (5 J/m2 UV or 1 mM DMS). Therefore,
the number of control cells is almost always greater than that
of the treated cells. However, replicating cells are observed at
48 h post-treatment even with 20 J/m2 UV or 1 mM DMS.
Thus, using 20 J/m2 UV and 1 mM DMS for the repair studies,
at least 85% of the initial number of cells are viable.
Global repair of CPDs is identical in normal and
telomerase-immortalized cells
To test the repair of CPDs at the global level, we treated both
HF57 and HTERTG with 20 J/m2 of UV radiation and either
harvested the cells immediately or allowed for repair of DNA
at various times. Following DNA isolation, it was treated with
T4 DNA UV endonuclease followed by E.coli photolyase and
analyzed by denaturing alkaline gel electrophoresis. Figure 3a
shows the progressive repair observed in both cell lines from
0 to 48 h, with no significant difference in the repair rates.
Figure 3b demonstrates that quantitatively, the Mw values for
repair in the two lines have no significant differences. The
same experiment in the HTERTC cell line also provided
results indistinguishable from those of HTERTG and HF57.
Repair of CPDs at nucleotide resolution is identical
in normal and telomerase-immortalized cells
To follow repair at nucleotide resolution for both normal and
telomerase-immortalized cells, the DNA treated with T4 UV
endonuclease and DNA photolyase was subjected to LMPCR
analysis in exon 5 of the human P53 gene on both the trans-
lated strand (TS) and the non-translated strand (NTS). The
results shown in Figure 4 demonstrate that the repair patterns
obtained in both cell lines on both strands are virtually ident-
ical. Similar results were obtained using the HTERTB cell line.
Repair of CPDs on the TS and NTS is identical in
normal and telomerase-immortalized cells
To further demonstrate that NER has the same characteristics
in both HF57 and HTERTG, some of the CPD band intensities
in these cell lines are shown. Figure 5 shows repair at some
individual nucleotide positions based on data obtained using
RFLPScan. Bands representing slow, fast or intermediate rates
were chosen to illustrate the similarity of repair at nucleotide
resolution at the individual time points. At least six time points
were analyzed for the different clones examined. Figure 5
shows that only one point is substantially different in its repair
rate for CPDs. That time point is found at 12 h in the position
labeled as ‘Fast’. The other points are within the experimental
error.
Data collected for the repair half-lives of CPDs in exon 5
of the P53 gene are shown in Figure 6. There are only slight
alterations in the repair rates in the HF57 and HTERTG
lines that are observed at nucleotide resolution. There are
few positions of CPD sites in exon 5 on the TS. To obtain
an indication of the repair on the TS and NTS overall, the
average values for repair half-lives (20 and 22 h for CPD bands
on the NTS in HF57 and HTERG and 16 and 19 h for CPD
bands on the TS for those two lines, respectively) were cal-
culated based on the number of CPDs and their repair rates as
indicated in Figure 6. It should be emphasized that this number
is not a number weighted on the intensity of each band, but
only a simple average of the repair half-lives; therefore, the
difference in CPD repair on the TS is faster than on the NTS,
but not as fast as might be expected based on a weighted
average. There is less than half the number of CPDs on the
TS compared with the NTS and that reduces the difference in
the repair rates on the NTS and the TS. The fact that the
repair rates at all the nucleotide positions are extremely similar
is another demonstration that NER in the telomerase-
immortalized cells is identical to that observed for normal
human fibroblasts.

DNA damage inflicted by methylating agents is removed
to a large extent by BER. To investigate the effect of telo-
merase immortalization on BER, HF57 and the telomerase-
immortalized lines were treated with DMS and allowed to
repair. The DNA was isolated from the cells and subjected
to treatment with AlkA protein and mild alkali. The AlkA/
alkali-treated DNA was separated on an alkaline gel as shown
in Figure 7a. The Mw values progressively increase as a func-

that there is no significant difference between the DNA repair
observed in HF57 and HTERTG. Similar results were obtained
with the HTERTB cell line.

Repair of CPDs at nucleotide resolution is identical in
normal and telomerase-immortalized human skin
fibroblast cells
The DNA analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis was ana-
lyzed at nucleotide resolution using LMPCR (Figure 8). The
bands in Figure 8 result mainly from 3-meA and 7-meG modi-
fications. DMS modifies almost every G or A position, so a
large number of bands are observed. Qualitative examination
of the repair rates suggests that there is little difference in the
repair rates observed between the two cell lines.
Repair of N-methylpurines on the TS and NTS is
identical in normal and telomerase-immortalized cells
The bands in Figure 8 were analyzed for their relative intensity
compared with the point of repair time at 0 h. Figure 9 shows
that quantitatively the differences observed in the bands are
statistically insignificant. Therefore, repair is observed at the
same rate in both HF57 and HTERTG.
The data obtained from exon 5 for repair half-lives are
accumulated in Figure 10 for repair in HF57 and HTERTG.
The average repair half-life for N-methylpurines on the NTS is
51 h and for N-methylpurines on the TS, 45 h for both cell
lines. Therefore, repair of N-methylpurine damage in normal
and telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts is identical.
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that telomerase overexpression does not
alter the repair of UV damage in normal human foreskin
fibroblasts. The extension of life span by the HTERT reverse
transcriptase does not alter NER at any level, thus suggesting
that these human skin fibroblasts are an excellent model for the
study of repair in human cells. These experiments demonstrate
that at every level of NER, no differences are observed
between the normal and telomerase-immortalized lines. BER
for repair of N-methylpurines is also identical for HTERT-
immortalized fibroblasts and normal human skin fibroblasts.

However, while the BER of N-methylpurines is the same
in both normal and HTERT-immortalized fibroblasts, it is
possible that BER of other adducts, e.g. induced by oxidative
damage, could be different.
Originally, telomerase-immortalized human skin fibroblast
cells (BJ-1) were derived from a pre-senescent culture, a strat-
egy that clearly demonstrated the transforming capability of
HTERT (51,52). However, since these cells are not far from
the point of crisis, they proliferate poorly compared with skin
fibroblasts at a lower population doubling level. Although they
overexpress telomerase and possess long telomeres, we found
BJ-1 difficult to use in our experiments. Clearly, although
senescence is delayed in BJ-1 telomerase-transformed cells,
the proliferative properties of the cell line are not close to that

of fibroblasts that are at a point of much less population doub-
lings. We chose to transform a much younger cell (with respect
to in vitro age), reasoning that longer starting telomeres might
be more easily maintained. Our cultures consist of small,
rapidly dividing cells if maintained optimally. Like their
normal counterparts, HTERTG cells held at confluence grow
large, polyploid/multinucleate and cease proliferation. Thus,
the capacity for contact inhibition is also unaffected by
telomerase overexpression.
Telomere lengths are a statistical average not only because
the population of cells sampled contains some senescent cells,
but also because there is variation in the telomere length on
individual chromosomes of a given cell (53). Thus, in a pre-
senescent cell, if the telomeres of a linkage group bearing a
critical growth control gene are sufficiently short to allow
dicentric chromosome formation (54), followed by chromo-
some breakage in the growth control gene, immortalization
and escape from senescence could occur.
Certain proteins associated with DNA repair of double-
strand breaks, most notably KU70 and KU80, associate
with telomeres and these proteins have a role in telomere
maintenance (55–59). Thus, one hypothesis would be that
the HTERT expression could alter double-strand break
repair. Therefore, it is noteworthy that g-radiation survival
and double-strand break repair are identical in normal
and telomerase-immortalized cells as demonstrated in recent
papers (60,61). This suggests that although telomerase func-
tion is linked to survival after ionizing radiation exposure
(62–64), increased HTERT subunit expression does not alter
repair of double-strand breaks induced by g-radiation. In this
paper, we have shown that it is the same for NER repair and
BER of DMS-induced methylated bases.
A recent publication has indicated that there is some dif-
ference in repair in human oral fibroblasts compared with the
data we have presented in this paper (44). Several differences
are notable between the two studies. First, except for the UV
irradiation studies, all the previous work relies on episomal
damage and transfection. In the UV study, the authors only had
two time points for evaluation. In the two cell lines examined,
one line was almost identical to that of the normal oral fibro-
blasts; that does not support the conclusion of the paper that
there is a difference between normal and telomerase-
immortalized oral fibroblasts. It is also possible that there is
a difference between skin and oral fibroblasts. One other dif-
ference between the two studies is that the previous study has
used end points that are not necessarily associated with repair
rates and may involve other processes associated with the
formation of mutations. A final point of difference between
this and the previous study involves the UVC flux. In this
study, we used 20 J/m2, whereas the other report employed
a lower 2.5 J/m2 flux. However, in previous reports, repair of
UV-induced damage has been shown to maintain repair char-
acteristics until exposed to 30 J/m2 flux (65). Therefore, no
differences in repair should be observed at 2.5 versus 20 J/m2
flux values.
In conclusion, telomerase up-regulation has proved a useful
alternative to the use of transforming viruses (SV40, etc.) for
the establishment of cell lines from cell types difficult to cul-
ture (10). The use of the HTERTG, HTERTB and HTERTC
cell lines to study DNA repair is a robust alternative to the
use of cell lines, such as its parental HF57 or other human skin
fibroblasts, that undergo cellular senescence for the study of
NER and BER. These lines will provide researchers with a
human cell line at a relatively low passage number that can
serve as the basis for studies without dependence on passage
number or morphological changes associated with cellular
aging. Such alterations could reduce at least one source of
differences in the response of cells to DNA damage.
