ABSTRACT
High-throughput 454 DNA sequencing technology
allows much faster and more cost-effective sequen-
cing than traditional Sanger sequencing. However,
the technology imposes inherent limitations on the
number of samples that can be processed in
parallel. Here we introduce parallel tagged sequen-
cing (PTS), a simple, inexpensive and flexible
barcoding technique that can be used for parallel
sequencing any number and type of double-
stranded nucleic acid samples. We demonstrate
that PTS is particularly powerful for sequencing
contiguous DNA fragments such as mtDNA gen-
omes: in theory as many as 250 mammalian mtDNA
genomes can be sequenced in a single GS FLX run.
PTS dramatically increases the sequencing through-
put of samples in parallel and thus fully mobilizes
the resources of the 454 technology for targeted
sequencing.
INTRODUCTION
Since its introduction, the beneﬁts of 454 sequencing
(1) have been exploited for an increasing number of
applications, including genomic sequencing (2), cDNA
sequencing (3) and ultra-deep amplicon sequencing (4).
Despite its power in generating a great number of
sequences from few samples, 454 sequencing is at present
unsuitable for studies requiring targeted sequence data
from many diﬀerent samples. This limitation is particu-
larly pertinent to population and medical genetics studies.
The 454 sequencing plate can be physically divided into a
maximum of sixteen regions, each of which yields an
average of 0.63 and 2.88 Mb per run for the GS20 and
the new GS FLX sequencing platforms, respectively.
If shotgun libraries from 16 human mtDNA genomes
are sequenced in a single run, each genome will on
average be covered 70- and 350-fold for GS20 and GS
FLX, respectively. Despite the low cost per sequenced
nucleotide, the high coverage and cost per run make
this approach impractical. Furthermore, the physical
separation of the plate reduces the total number of
sequences retrieved from one run to roughly half and
consumes more time and material, as each sample must be
processed separately. Thus, even further physical separa-
tion of the plate would not solve these inherent problems.
One approach to overcoming these limitations is to
barcode samples with sample-speciﬁc sequence tags.
Samples are pooled prior to 454 sequencing and are
identiﬁed after sequencing by their unique sequence tags.
This approach has been used to barcode cDNA libraries
with tagged primers for reverse transcription (5). Recently,
Binladen et al. (6) used 50-tagged PCR primers to
distinguish amplicon sequences derived from diﬀerent
sources. However, this method requires the synthesis of
sample-speciﬁc primers for each target under study, which
is time-consuming and cost-prohibitive when dealing
with large sample sizes. Currently, no method exists
for barcoding small genomic libraries or amplicons
derived from untagged PCR primers. The resources of
454 sequencing therefore cannot be fully exploited for
applications that require low coverage sequencing of many
diﬀerent samples.
Despite the potential beneﬁts a barcoding method for
454 sequencing oﬀers, any proposed technique must
ensure eﬃcient use of sequencing resources and high
data reliability. Incomplete reactions and sequencing
errors can result in background sequences without a
sequence tag, heterogeneous sequence representation
among samples and false-assignment of sequences to
their sample origin. We have developed a method called
parallel tagged sequencing (PTS) that largely alleviates
these problems.
PTS is based on a ligation strategy analogous to the one
utilized in the standard 454 library preparation procedure
(1), the use of barcoding adapters and a restriction system
that excludes background sequences. An outline of the
method is displayed in Figure 1A. In separate reactions
DNA molecules from diﬀerent samples are blunt end
repaired and phosphorylated. Subsequently, sample-
speciﬁc barcoding adapters are ligated to both ends of
the molecules, and the resulting nicks are removed by a
strand-displacing polymerase. Each barcoding adapter
is comprised of a single self-hybridized palindromic

oligonucleotide containing an SrfI restriction site ﬂanked
by complementary sequence tags (Figure 1B). This setup
requires only a single oligonucleotide to be synthesized in
order to barcode each sample. The barcoded samples are
then quantiﬁed, pooled in a ratio reﬂecting the proportion
of sequences desired from each sample and treated with
phosphatase to remove residual 50 phosphates of unligated
ends. Such unligated ends may arise during the adapter
ﬁll-in step in molecules containing single-strand nicks
caused by nebulization. Half of the adapter is then cut oﬀ
by SrfI, which is a rare cutter in mammalian genomes (7).
It leaves blunt ends with 50 phosphates and allows
the pooled samples to be directly processed using the
standard 454 library preparation. Phosphatase treatment
in conjunction with SrfI digestion eﬀectively reduces
background sequences when starting from nebulized
DNA; untagged molecule ends are prevented from being
ligated to the universal 454 adapters during library
preparation.
The sequence output from barcoded libraries begins
with the sequence key TCAG, which originates from the
universal 454 adapters, followed by four non-informative
nucleotides GGGC from the SrfI site. Since the 454
technique uses sequencing-by-synthesis, all G’s are incor-
porated in the same nucleotide ﬂow as the last key base,
and therefore do not decrease the read length. The origin
of the sequence is identiﬁed through the adjacent sequence
tag. We developed a tag design that is particularly robust
to sequencing errors associated with homopolymers,
a well-known problem in 454 sequencing (1,8,9). At a
length of 6 bp, it allows the pooling of a maximum of
72 samples into a single sequencing library (Figure 1B).
Since the 454 sequencing plate is always split into at least
two regions, this conﬁguration allows for the parallel
processing of up to 144 samples in a single run.
We demonstrate the power of parallel tagged
454 sequencing by shotgun sequencing six human
mtDNA genomes on two 16th plate regions of the GS20
platform. Published Sanger sequences for these samples
allow a comparison of the two sequencing approaches.
Additionally, we veriﬁed the reproducibility of the method
by independently sequencing a second set of six human
mtDNA genomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of shotgun libraries
Six human genomic DNA samples and their respective
mtDNA genome sequences were obtained from a previous
study and the CEPH panel (10,11). For the replicate
experiment, six additional samples were kindly provided
by Mark Stoneking. The mtDNA genomes were ampliﬁed
in two overlapping fragments using the Expand Long
Range dNTPack kit (Roche) and equimolar mixtures of
50 blocked and unmodiﬁed PCR primers in order to
avoid sequence overrepresentation within the two ampli-
con overlaps (oligonucleotide sequences listed in
Supplementary Table 2). Amplicons were puriﬁed using
the PCR puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen) and quantiﬁed using an
ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies).
Amplicons from each sample were combined in equal
molar ratios to obtain roughly one microgram of DNA
per sample. Shotgun DNA libraries with a mean fragment
Figure 1. Workﬂow for barcoding and sequencing double-stranded DNA samples. (A) The DNA is blunt end repaired (I) and sample-speciﬁc self-
complementary oligos are self-hybridized to form double-stranded barcoding adapters (II), which are subsequently ligated to both ends of the DNA
molecules (III). Resulting nicks are removed by strand-displacement (IV). Individually tagged samples are combined into a single master library and
treated with phosphatase. Half of the adapter is removed by SrfI digestion (V) leaving ligatable ends for the standard 454 library production. After
sequencing (VI), the tags are used to identify the sample origin and removed prior to further analysis. (B) Barcoding tags begin with either an A or T,
followed by four freely chosen nucleotides and end with C or G with no homopolymers allowed. From 324 possible tags, 72 can be chosen to diﬀer
by at least two substitutions.

size of 500 bp were prepared using nebulizers and
chemicals from the GS20 library preparation kit (Roche)
according to the manual.
Parallel tagged sequencing
Roughly 500 ng of nebulized DNA were blunt end
repaired in 40 ml reactions containing 1 buﬀer Tango,
100 mM each dNTP, 1mM ATP, 40U T4 polynucleotide
kinase, 12U T4 DNA polymerase (all Fermentas) and
0.125 mg/ml BSA (Sigma). After incubation for 15min at
128C and 15min at 258C, the reactions were puriﬁed using
the MinElute PCR Puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen), which was
also used for all subsequent puriﬁcation steps. Double-
stranded barcoding adapters were prepared by brieﬂy
heating 100 mM solutions of palindromic oligos to 958C
and cooling them to room temperature at a rate of 0.18C/s.
Adapters were ligated to the blunt end DNA in separate
40 ml reactions, containing 1 T4 ligase buﬀer, 5% PEG-
4000, 5U T4 ligase (all Fermentas) and 8 ml barcoding
adapter. After incubation at 228C for 1 h, the reactions
were puriﬁed. The DNA was then incubated for 20min
at 378C in 30 ml reactions containing 1 Thermopol
buﬀer, 250 mM of each dNTP and 8U Bst polymerase
(NEB), followed by reaction puriﬁcation. According to
the nanodrop, puriﬁed yields were between 25 and 43 ng/ml,
but since we observed intrasample measurement varia-
tion of 20%, triplicate measurements were carried out
to estimate mean concentrations.
One hundred nanogram of adapter-ligated DNA from
each of the six samples were pooled and treated with calf
intestine phosphatase in a single 40 ml reaction containing
1NEBuﬀer 3 and 30U calf intestinal phosphatase (NEB)
for 1 h at 378C. After puriﬁcation, the DNA was digested
with SrfI in a 30 ml reaction containing 1 universal buﬀer
and 10U SrfI (Stratagene) for 3 h at 378C and puriﬁed
again. A single sequencing library was produced using the
standard GS20 library preparation procedure, but starting
at the adapter ligation step. According to the standard
GS20 sequencing procedure, the library was directly
sequenced on two 16th regions of a full GS20 sequencing
plate without a prior titration run.
Sequence data processing
Raw 454 reads from the standard ﬂow ﬁles (SFF) begin
with the artiﬁcial sequence TCAGGGGC followed by the
6 bp barcode. To compensate for homopolymer miscalls
and carry forward eﬀects, two to six Gs, followed by one
or two Cs and an additional G were accepted while
scanning for barcode sequences. If the following 6 bp had
the general pattern of a barcode, starting with A or T,
ending with C or G with adjacent bases diﬀering, the
‘clip_adapter_left’ entry in the SFF ﬁle was overwritten to
the point after the barcode, causing the 454 software tools
to ignore this part of the sequence. The 30 ends of the reads
were then scanned for the reverse-complement of the
barcode sequence and, if found, the ‘clip_adapter_right’
entry was set to also remove this part. The modiﬁed SFF
ﬁles were then separated according to the barcode
sequences using ‘sﬀﬁle’ and directly submitted into
runMapper v1.0.53.17 for assembly. The consensus
sequences are available as Supplementary Data.
RESULTS
Nebulized DNA fragments from six human mtDNA
genomes were barcoded, pooled into a single sequencing
library and sequenced on a small region of the 454 picotitre
plate. An independent replicate experiment was carried
out using six diﬀerent samples. Only a limited amount of
variation was observed for the sequence representation
among samples: between 1995 and 4154 sequences were
obtained from each sample in the ﬁrst experiment
(Figure 2A); the second experiment yielded between
3267 and 5731 sequences from each sample (Figure 2B).
The variation was observed both within and between runs,
indicating that there is no underlying ligation bias leading
to diﬀerential eﬃciencies in the tagging reactions. In fact,
we could not detect incomplete tagging with any of the
barcoding adapters when optimizing the protocol using a
PCR product as template. Therefore, we think that a more
accurate quantiﬁcation of the number of molecules
contained in each barcoded sample is likely to further
increase the homogeneity of sequence representation
among samples. This could be achieved by DNA
quantiﬁcation methods more sensitive than UV absorp-
tion, such as ﬂuorescence-based picogreen quantiﬁcation
assays (12). In addition, for each barcoded sample the
mean fragment size could be determined by capillary
electrophoresis (13), which allows for inferring the actual
molar concentration rather than the simple mass concen-
tration, thereby accounting for diﬀerences in fragment size
distributions after nebulization.
As little as 3% of the sequences obtained from both
runs could not be assigned to a correct sequence tag.
Whereas most of these sequences did not begin with a tag,
260 of the 44 016 sequences generated in both runs carried
tag sequences that diﬀered by at least one substitution
from the tags that were used. In 154 of these cases, the
tag sequences diﬀered by at least two substitutions and
could therefore possibly be assigned to a false sample.
Depending on the number of tags used, this represents

(A and B, respectively).

a maximum false assignment rate of 0.35%. High cover-
age makes it unlikely that single misidentiﬁed reads will
aﬀect consensus sequence accuracy, but if necessary, the
false assignment rate could be reduced by extending the
tag length. The average coverage for each genome ranged
from 10- to 22-fold and from 19- to 32-fold in the ﬁrst
and second experiment, respectively (see Supplementary
Table 1). The coverage distribution along the mtDNA
genome shows only moderate variation, with the excep-
tion of under-representation of reads close to the amplicon
ends (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1). This arises
due to reduced breakage of molecules at their ends. Thus,
apart from the regions adjacent to the shorter amplicon
overlap, all positions of the mtDNA genomes were
covered by at least one sequence read, except for 3 bp
from one of the 12 sequences.
To assess the resulting sequence quality, the
consensus sequences of six mtDNA genomes were
compared to their previously published Sanger sequences.
In 99 kb of sequence four substitutions were detected
between the Sanger and the 454 consensus sequences,
corresponding to more than 99.99% agreement. However,
we observed single base-pair insertions or deletions at a
frequency of 0.27% on average (see Supplementary
Table 1). Indel rate estimates derived from previous
454 genome sequencing projects are lower (1,8,9), but
in-depth comparisons are diﬃcult due to the diﬀerent
natures of the sequenced genomes and the limited amount
of data available in this study. The frequency of indels
decreases as coverage increases (see Supplementary
Figure 2), but higher coverage sequencing would be
required to determine whether the indel rate decreases to
previously determined rates at >30-fold coverage.
DISCUSSION
PTS allows the parallel generation of DNA sequences
from a large number of samples using 454 high-
throughput sequencing. It provides several advantages
over simple physical separation of the sequencing plate
or previously published tagging techniques. First, it
allows highly parallel sequencing of small shotgun
libraries derived, for example, from long-range amplicons
or plasmids. Second, PTS can be applied to the sequencing
of single or pooled PCR products. It thereby facilitates a
simple switch from classical Sanger sequencing to
454 sequencing without the need to change the experi-
mental design of existing PCR applications (e.g. by
ordering new primers). This is particularly useful for
applications that require microbial subcloning, since
454 sequences derive from single molecules. The oligo-
nucleotide tags can be reused for any PCR system and
on any type of double-stranded DNA. Third, the number
of samples that can be sequenced in parallel using PTS is
increased by an order of magnitude compared to the
use of a plate’s 16 subunits. Moreover, since physical
separation decreases the overall number of sequences
obtained, PTS enables targeted DNA sequencing at a
lower price per nucleotide. In fact, optimal use of this
technique can drastically reduce sequencing costs com-
pared to traditional Sanger sequencing. Using PTS, a
single run of the GS20 platform, which usually yields at
least 20 Mb, can currently provide sequences for more
than 50 mtDNA genomes at 20-fold coverage. With an
output of 100 Mb per run it should be possible to obtain
more than 250 mtDNA genome sequences at this
coverage on the higher throughput GS FLX platform.
Our data indicate that aiming for 20-fold average
coverage is suﬃcient to obtain complete consensus
sequences for all or the vast majority of the samples,
as we expect each genome to be covered between 10- and
30-fold. Even at 10-fold average coverage, the resulting
sequence quality is suﬃcient to accurately identify
substitutional diﬀerences. However, the frequency of
single base-pair insertion and deletion errors in and
around homopolymers increases with lower coverage.
These errors can be easily identiﬁed and eliminated when
closely related sequences are available for comparison,
but may represent a more serious problem when this is

sequence. The overlapping regions of the long-range amplicons are

not the case. Therefore, the optimal coverage range
should be determined according to each study’s parti-
cular requirements. For nuclear sequences, higher aver-
age coverage will be necessary if polymorphic positions
must be reliably detected.
For sequencing continuous stretches of DNA, the
shotgun sequencing of long-range PCR fragments using
PTS provides several advantages over traditional Sanger
sequencing. First, it is much less time-consuming, as it
reduces the work load for setting up PCRs and sequencing
reactions. Second, it decreases the risk of allelic dropout
due to primer template mismatches, which is especially
important when working with species for which no
genomic sequence information exists. Third, apart from
the primer sequences, no prior information is needed for
sequence assembly. This feature is especially useful for
reliably obtaining unknown exon–intron structures of
genes when primers are designed to anneal to conserved
exonic sequences. The use of SrfI, a restriction enzyme
with restrictions sites approximately every 150 kb in the
human genome, guarantees a minimal number of drop-
outs due to restriction occurring within a sequence
fragment. Even if a sequence fragment contains an SrfI
site, due to the random fragmentation of DNA by
nebulization, this would only prevent coverage immedi-
ately adjacent to the SrfI site itself.
In summary, we have developed a system that allows for
high-throughput sequencing of targeted DNA sequences
using the 454 system or any other parallel sequencing
system (14). Our technique substantially increases the
throughput for targeted sequencing compared to tradi-
tional Sanger sequencing, while at the same time decreas-
ing the cost per nucleotide. PTS can be readily adapted to
any existing experimental design and enables sequencing
any type of double-stranded DNA from multiple samples.
