ABSTRACT
IntAct is an open source database and software
suite for modeling, storing and analyzing molecular
interaction data. The data available in the database
originates entirely from published literature and is
manually annotated by expert biologists to a high
level of detail, including experimental methods,
conditions and interacting domains. The database
features over 126 000 binary interactions extracted
from over 2100 scientific publications and makes
extensive use of controlled vocabularies. The web
site provides tools allowing users to search, visua-
lize and download data from the repository. IntAct
supports and encourages local installations as well
as direct data submission and curation collabo-
rations. IntAct source code and data are freely
available from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact.
INTRODUCTION
The understanding of the cell machinery, the characterization
of protein function as well as the discovery of new drug
targets can be greatly enhanced by studying molecular inter-
actions. We have witnessed in the past few years, a consider-
able increase of the number of publications reporting
molecular interaction, but also the amount of interactions
reported in a single publication, scaling from a single to
over 22 000 binary interactions (1). The fragmentation of
the datasets as well as their lack of formal representation
makes it often difficult to reuse the data as the foundation
for further research. IntAct addresses these issues by manu-
ally annotating published manuscripts reporting molecular
interaction data and formalizing it by using a comprehensive
set of controlled vocabularies in order to ensure data
integrity. The data are made publicly available using the
PSI-MI XML Standard (2), providing end users with the
highest level of details without compromising the integrity
and simplicity of access to the data, thanks to the use of
well established standards.
DATA MODEL
The IntAct data model has grown more flexible and detailed
over the years in order to cope with the ever evolving level of
detail captured by experimentalists (e.g. kinetic data).
We are now going to describe a few key features of the
IntAct data model, for a full description please see the
annotated UML model on the website.
Molecule types
IntAct focuses on the curation of protein–protein interactions,
but now also captures a growing number of key studies provi-
ding details of DNA, RNA and small molecule interactions.
The list of interactor types is still evolving over time and
we need our model to encompass these additions without
compromising its stability. Thus, we model different mole-
cule types by a generalized ‘interactor’ datatype, which is
further specified by a hierarchical controlled vocabulary of
the PSI-MI ontology. Hence, should we be adding a new
one in the future, the IntAct data model would remain
unchanged and a new controlled vocabulary term would be
added. You can find more details on the hierarchical structure
and the specific terms within this ontology in the Ontology
Lookup Service (3) (Figure 1).
Interacting domains
It is becoming more and more common to find in publica-
tions, details such as the relevant domain of an interacting
protein. This is known in IntAct as Feature and now allows
some lack of clarity by the author in the definition of the
domain boundaries of a subsequence, reflecting experimental
uncertainties. Here are a few examples of range:
(i) Ser-7,
(ii) from 4 to between 10 and 23,

(iii) from 78 to <142,
(iv) transmembrane region.
One can also use features to represent modifications to the
original molecule made by the author, e.g. a C-terminal tag
on a protein used in a tandem affinity purification protocol.
Hierarchical build-up
The modeling of a molecular interaction can be convoluted,
sometimes requiring the description of complex sub-units
that are later assembled to form larger interactions. In order
to cope with this requirement, the hierarchical build-up of
molecular interactions was introduced. Interactions can be
used as an interactor, and thus they can be reused in the con-
text of other interactions.
Negative data
This is reported only to a very strict criteria, e.g. when an
author produces contradictory results within a single paper,
or when isoforms are shown to behave differently in respect
to potential interacting partners. Negative experiments are
clearly indicated as such and may be easily filtered out if
not required.
CURATION PROCESS AND QUALITY
ASSURANCE
IntAct strives to provide users with data featuring a high level
of structured annotation (i.e. as far as available in the publica-
tion). The ways to achieve this goal are manifold:
Controlled vocabularies
IntAct makes extensive use of ontologies to represent
experimental conditions as well as general concepts such as
databases or interactor types and thus enforces data integrity
and provides a powerful means for searching data. IntAct
mainly uses the ontologies of the PSI-MI standard for
molecular interactions (Table 1).
Mapping of biological objects
Interacting molecules are systematically mapped to stable
identifiers from public databases such as UniProtKB (4) for
proteins, ChEBI (5) and the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (6) nuc-
leotide databases for nucleic acids for small molecules. This
is a highly time consuming part of the curation process but it
is also crucial to ensure precision and comparability of the
data. In cases where the authors give sequence information
when describing a feature such as an interacting residue or
binding site, this is mapped back to the parent sequence
(or, when possible, the appropriate isoform) in UniProtKB.
In cases where sequence information is not given, e.g.
when identification is made by antibody detection, it is
assumed that the authors annotation is correct however main-
taining within IntAct an association between both the inter-
action and the corresponding descriptions of both the
interaction and participant detection methods allows the

controlled vocabulary term displays additional information such as definition, literature references, cross references, etc.

user to make their own assessment of the accuracy of this
data. When mapping high throughput datasets, there is
often a small proportion of participants which cannot be
traced due to the instability of the identifier used. Protein
are remapped to UniProtKB, to allow use of their versioning
and archiving services to maintain mappings and author
identifiers are retained and revisited to attempt to improve
coverage upto 100%.
Curation manual
Over the years, we have written and maintained a very
detailed curation manual explaining how IntAct records are
being curated. This manual is publicly available from the
IntAct home page.
Expert curation
All records are manually annotated by domain experts, using
the curation manual as a reference guide. Every record is then
cross-checked by a second curator.
Software checking
By studying the record produced over time, a set of recurrent
data consistency issues has been identified. Computational
checking for these cases is performed on a nightly basis.
Curators are sent reports and requested to amend the records
concerned.
Direct submissions
Authors of publications reporting molecular interaction data
are encouraged to submit the interaction data to IntAct
prior to publication. On finalization of the record, we will
issue a public accession number that can be referred to in
the manuscript. However, the data will only be released on
publication of the manuscript or on explicit request of the
data submitter. For details of submission methods and for-
mats, please refer to the deposition page of the International
Molecular intraction Exchange (IMEx) consortium of
molecular interaction databases at http://imex.sf.net.
Curation collaborations
IntAct increasingly collaborates with partners on specific
curation topics, either performing targeted curation for colla-
borators, or providing a private instance of IntAct as well as
infrastructure and support for curation project by external
partners. If you are interested in either of these, please contact
intact-help@ebi.ac.uk. IntAct data is released on a weekly
basis and is available on the web site as well as for download
in PSI-MI 1.0 and 2.5 XML format (classified by organism
and publication).
APPLICATIONS
In addition to its publicly available data, IntAct provide sev-
eral web applications allowing users to browse, visualize and
perform analyzes of the data stored in the repository (be it
their own local instance of IntAct or the EBI public reposi-
tory). We are now going to describe a few enhancements
made on existing applications as well as new applications
made available to the community.
Easy data download
The experiment view (Figure 2) allows users to download the
publication currently being viewed by simply clicking on one
of the icons in the upper left corner, two formats are currently
available: PSI-MI XML 1.0 and 2.5.
Textual browsing
In order to respond to the increasing amount of data being
stored in the database as well as the number of interactions
that can be extracted from a single publication, we have
developed ways to easily browse through large collections
of data while keeping usability and performance at their
best. Whenever a user request matches a large amount of
data, a paging mechanism splits the dataset in smaller chunks
that the user can navigate at will.
Data search
A simple, yet versatile, search engine is available and allow
to search for a broad variety of criteria such as publication ID,
InterPro domain, UniProtKB ID, gene names, IMEx ID.
When searching through large amount of data, search criteria
combination and filtering become crucial features. In order
to give users more freedom, a Lucene-based (http://lucene.
apache.org) search module was integrated, thus, giving
more flexibility when building queries as well as the opportu-
nity to apply controlled vocabulary filters. For instance, one
can search all experiments using the interaction detection
method ‘fluorescent resonance energy transfer’. Hierarchical
controlled vocabularies can be displayed graphically in
order to simplify term’s selection.
Visualisation
Previously we reported on a functionality which allowed the
user to display common Gene Ontology (GO) (7) annotation
shared by a cluster of interacting molecules (8). We now
allow users to highlight interactor sharing the same InterPro
(9) annotation. Furthermore, the currently displayed inter-
action network can be saved in either PSI-MI XML 1.0 or
2.5. Doing so allow users to import their data into third
party tools, such as Cytoscape (10) or Proviz (11) to enable
further analysis.
Over the past two years, we have introduced new applica-
tions allowing users to perform analysis of interaction net-
works. MiNe (Minimal connecting Interaction Network)
enables the understanding of how a given set of proteins
relate to each other by looking for the shortest path connect-
ing them in the underlying interaction network. The result of
such query is displayed graphically using our visualization
engine. The resulting interaction network can be downloaded
in PSI-MI XML.
Statistics
The number of interactions curated in IntAct has almost
tripled in the past two years, you can find more details such
as the species’ coverage and the representation of interaction
detection methods on our statistics page available online:
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/statisticView.
There is an increasing number of scientific publication
reporting on large scale interactome analysis based on
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue D563
pull-down of complexes. A crucial step in planning large
scale experiments is the bait selection. IntAct provides an
experimental tool that aims at assisting scientist by comput-
ing a prioritized list of ‘best bait’ which are expected to
yield the highest return in experimental effort. These lists
are generated using the Pay-As-You-Go strategy (12) which
detects and prioritizes those proteins which have the highest
likelihood of being hubs based on the current data within
IntAct for various species. Using this strategy would save a
large amount of experimental effort. This of course relies
on the timely deposition of experimental data into the IntAct
database in order that the Pay-As-You-Go algorithm remains
up-to-date and effective.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
IntAct is constantly being improved and new services are
made available regularly. Here are a few upcoming services:
Tabular data
Though PSI-MI XML provides a very detailed representation
of molecular interaction data, many users are seeking a
simplified representation of it. IntAct is going to provide
tabular data files in the new PSI-MI tabular format
containing binary interactions, reference to the originating
publications as well as a minimal details about experimental
conditions.
Datasets
As a result of an increasing number of external collabora-
tions, we have increased the level of topic specific
annotations, for example interactions believed to be involved
in disease states such as cancer and Alzheimer’s and
organism specific sets such as cyanobacteria. We are
developing extensions of our textual browsing tools for
displaying these dataset more comprehensively, including
statistics and improved access to data downloads in various
formats.
Confidence score
Molecular interaction data originating from large scale
experiments can be of varying quality. False positives can
result from many causes: interactions that are identified in
an experiment but actually never take place in the cell or
inaccurate interpretation/breakdown of a complex into binary
interactions. We are currently developing a statistical method
that will allow the identification of interactions that are more
likely to be biologically relevant.
Curated complexes
Many protein complexes can be isolated as a functional unit
and their role in the cell, and the processes in which they are
involved in, are thought to be well understood. However, the
actual protein composition of such complexes can vary under
different physiological conditions and the importance of such
changes are far from fully comprehended. Authors often
do not make clear the actual protein content of a complex
when describing its activity and the nomenclature may
often be misleading—the transcription factor AP-1, e.g.
is in fact 16 different combinations of homo- and heterodi-
mers. IntAct is developing a dictionary of complex
nomenclature, with protein content clearly defined and
Figure 2. The IntAct experiment view. This view provides a very deep level of detail, including publication reference, experimental conditions and details of the
interaction and the participants. In the example shown above, the specific binding region is described as an amino acid sequence range. In addition, there are
details of point mutation leading to a decrease of the participants’ binding affinity. This interaction was found by searching for its IMEx accession number (i.e.
IM-1302). It appears in the record as a cross reference (Xref) of the interaction. Should users be wishing to download this data, a list of available formats is
available on the top left corner of the screen. The download encompasses the whole dataset related to the publication currently being displayed.

linked to experimental evidence, with each variation of a
complex given a distinct name and a separate entry. This
information is being linked to the corresponding entry in
the pathway database, Reactome (13), to give contextual
information.
DISCUSSION
IntAct has initially been developed to support local installa-
tion and has now instances running around the world.
Pharmaceutical companies, research laboratories as well as
interaction databases have chosen to adopt our open source
database and toolkit and whenever the need arise add novel
or adapt existing functionality. If you are interested in a col-
laboration or a local IntAct installation, please contact us at
intact-help@ebi.ac.uk or simply use the freely available
source code.
Working toward giving fully inclusive access to the ever
growing amount of molecular interaction data is a vast task,
likely to be beyond the reach of any single interaction data
resource. To share the curation workload, avoid redundant
curation and ensure consistency in annotation policies, five
public databases, BIND (14), MINT (15), DIP (16), MPact
(17) and IntAct, have formed the IMEx consortium
(IMEx—http://imex.sourceforge.net) to exchange molecular
interaction records between partners. This cumulative effort
should result in an overarching repository that is broader in
scope and deeper in information than any individual efforts
and one that scientists can use to better understand issues
of health and disease or in the development of new drugs
and therapeutics. To assist IMEx partners in capturing as
much of published interaction data as possible, please refer
to the IMEx website and submit your data pre-publication
to one of the IMEx partners. To aid this process, and to
ensure minimum data loss on submission due to the use of
ambiguous or unstable identifiers, it is suggested that such
data be compliant with the recently published Minimum
Information required for reporting a Molecular Interaction
Experiment (MIMIx) standard compliant (18).
