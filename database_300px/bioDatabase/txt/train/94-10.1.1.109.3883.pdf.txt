ABSTRACT
The PROSITE database consists of a large collection
of biologically meaningful signatures that are
10 described as patterns or profiles. Each signature is
linked to a documentation that provides useful biolo-
gical information on the protein family, domain or
functional site identified by the signature. The
PROSITE database is now complemented by a series
15 of rules that can give more precise information about
specific residues. During the last 2 years, the docu-
mentation and the ScanProsite web pages were
redesigned to add more functionalities. The latest
version of PROSITE (release 19.11 of September 27,
20 2005) contains 1329 patterns and 552 profile entries.
Over the past 2 years more than 200 domains have
been added, and now 52% of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
entries (release 48.1 of September 27, 2005) have a
cross-reference to a PROSITE entry. The database
25 is accessible at http://www.expasy.org/prosite/.
INTRODUCTION
The PROSITE database uses two kinds of signatures or
descriptors to identify conserved regions, i.e. patterns and
generalized profiles, which both have their own strengths
30 and weaknesses defining their area of optimum application.
Each PROSITE signature is linked to an annotation
document where the user can find information on the
protein family or domain detected by the signature: origin
of its name, taxonomic occurrence, domain architecture, func-
35 tion, 3D structure, main characteristics of the sequence,
domain size and some references. As a more detailed des-
cription of the PROSITE database has already been pro-
vided in previous publications (1,2), this paper will only
focus on recent developments that have taken place during
40 the last 2 years.
AUTOMATED UPDATE OF PATTERNS
Patterns or regular expressions are useful tools to identify short
and well-conserved regions, such as catalytic sites, binding
sites, post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) or zinc fin-
45gers. They are also easy to construct and to use by biologists
that have no knowledge in bioinformatics. But patterns do not
stand the test of time very well. If a new sequence has an amino
acid at a conserved position that was not present in the seed
alignment used to construct the pattern, it will not be recog-
50nized. Thus, patterns need to be updated regularly to introduce
this new variability in the regular expression.
We have developed a tool to identify weak patterns and
automatically update them. This tool uses the PROSITE
match list, which stores true positives, false positives (FP),
55false negatives (FN), partial and unknown matches, to gener-
ate a new pattern that minimizes FP and FN.
FP and FN updates are treated independently. We first take
care of FN in a three-step procedure:
(i) The patterns that can potentially be updated are selected.
60Updating a pattern to recover FN amounts to introduce
more variability in the pattern, but it increases the risk
of creating new FP. Hence, only patterns that are stringent
enough can be updated. The selection procedure consists
of running all PROSITE patterns on a random database
65to keep only the ones that do not produce too many
matches.
(ii) Mismatches produced by each FN are detected and the
pattern is modified accordingly to accept the observed
residues.
70(iii) The new pattern is tested on a random database to see
whether it is still stringent enough. If it produces too
many matches in a random database, the pattern is refined
and some mismatch positions are removed.
75To remove false positives we check ‘wildcard’ positions
(‘x’ with the PROSITE syntax) in the pattern. We look
at these positions for amino acids that are only found in FP
sequences. These amino acids are then ‘forbidden’ ({} with the
PROSITE syntax) at these positions in the new pattern.

The new pattern is then used to scan Swiss-Prot and all new
matches are checked manually. Only patterns that produce no
new false positives are kept.
This strategy has allowed the automatic update of 943 pat-
5 terns (out of a total of 1322 patterns in PROSITE). 2661 FN
(out of a total of 14 412) and 1927 FP (out of a total of 7446)
were removed. We have also removed the less specific patterns
that could not be updated and have replaced them by profiles.
The application of these two strategies allowed a decrease of
10 the number of FP and FN in the Swiss-Prot part of UniProt by
25%. The procedure to automatically update patterns is run
at each major release.
NEW FUNCTIONAL PREDICTION TOOL
When a signature identifies a conserved region in a given
15 protein, it is important to know what functional information
can be transferred to this new protein according to what is
known about the function of the conserved region. If the
information that is transferred is very general (name and posi-
tion of a given domain in a sequence) only the occurrence of a
20 match with a descriptor at a reliable score is enough. But
descriptors can supply much more precise information. If
one looks at the residue level, functional sites such as active
sites, disulfide bridges or PTM sites can be identified. One can
also look at the domain arrangement to discriminate between
25 particular families or sub-families. The predicted function of
the protein can thus be much more accurate.
PROSITE has a long experience in documentation and
detailed annotation of domains, families and functional sites.
This information is mainly stored in free text and used by bio-
30 logists who read the various documents and make their own
decision on the function of their protein according to the PRO-
SITE matches. But with the rapid growth of sequence databases,
there is an increasing need for a reliable tool that can generate
automatically precise and accurate functional annotation in
35 standard format. We thus decided to group some functional
information stored in PROSITE in a database of rules that
can easily be read by a program and applied on proteins that
are recognized by PROSITE profiles. We named this comple-
mentary database ProRule, for PROSITE rules. ProRule gener-
40 atesannotation inSwiss-Prot formatforDE,CC,KWorFTlines.
Two types of information are stored in ProRule:
(i) General information: the occurrence of a match with a
profile is enough to trigger this annotation. Usually, it is
restricted to the name of the domain and the position of its
45 boundaries.
(ii) Conditional information: this is dependent on the presence
of given amino acids at precise positions, on the occurrence
of other domains or on taxonomic specificity. This informa-
tion is only transferred if the conditions are fulfilled. For
50 example, an enzymatic active site is annotated only if the
correct amino acid is found at the required position.
ProRule is extensively used by Swiss-Prot curators to facil-
itate the annotation work and to check the consistency of
Swiss-Prot entries. But it can also be accessible for external
55 users through the ScanProsite web page (see below) or down-
loaded from the PROSITE ftp site under PROSITE license
conditions. For more details on ProRule and its range of
application see Sigrist et al. (3).
WEB PAGE
60The PROSITE website was redesigned and new predictive
tools were implemented to assign more detailed functional
information to the scanned proteins. Users who want to
scan their own proteins against all PROSITE entries or to
scan a PROSITE entry against a protein database will find
65a new version of the ScanProsite web page.
PROSITE matches on UniProt knowledgebase (Uni-
ProtKB) or PDB entries are now pre-calculated and stored
in a relational database (PostgreSQL) that is maintained in
collaboration with Swiss-Prot (4). This greatly speeds up
70the scanning of UniProtKB proteins. A domain visualizer
was integrated in the result page (see Figure 1a). Each ProRule
associated with a PROSITE profile is also scanned, which
allows the localization of interesting functional residues
such as active sites, PTMs and disulfide bridges. These
75features are only shown if the expected amino acid is found
at the right position. But we also indicate missing features
when we expect another amino acid at a given position.
This tool can be used to identify divergent subfamilies of
proteins like inactive enzymes. In Figure 1a, we show the
80ScanProsite output for the human ephrin B4 receptor, which
is a functional kinase receptor (5), and its paralogue the
ephrin B6 receptor, which is known to have an inactive
kinase domain (6). The ScanProsite output indicates that
the expected Asp residue was not found at the position of
85the active site in ephrin B6 receptor. To test the efficiency
of the method, we looked at mammalian homologues of ephrin
B6 receptor. We used ScanProsite to identify all mammalian
homologues of the ephrin B6 receptor and to construct a mul-
tiple sequence alignment (MSA) of this subfamily (Figure 1b).
90The MSA also shows that the conserved Asp residue of the
active site is found in none of the ephrin B6 receptor ortho-
logues. ScanProsite can also be used to identify new unchar-
acterized subfamilies of putatively inactive enzymes
(Figure 1c). From the ScanProsite web page, we have searched
95with the kinase profile (PS50011) for plant proteins that have
no detected active site and a common domain arrangement.
We have identified an uncharacterized family of putatively
inactive kinases, which is conserved in various plant genomes
as it is shown in the MSA.
100The documentation page has also been reorganized. It now
contains three main sections:
(i) The description part that exposes the main characteristics
of the domain or the family and a representative list
of proteins that contain the domain or belong to the
105family.
(ii) A technical section that refers to the descriptors used to
identify the domain or family. For each descriptor, there is
a link to a domain architecture view of UniProtKB proteins
matched by the descriptor, an MSA in different formats, a
110link to retrieve the list of proteins matched by the descriptor
in various formats and a link to a taxonomy tree view of all
entries containing the domain. There is also an external
link to MSDsite (7) to view ligand binding statistics of the
domain and a link to 3D structures.
115(iii) The third section is the reference block where, for each
reference, we added the PubMed ID and a direct link to the
article.

The architecture view of PROSITE profiles is now visible,
from each UniProtKB entry on the ExPASy server, from the
PROSITE documentation page and from the ScanProsite web
page. In each view, some interesting residues are tagged
5 according to ProRule predictions (see Figure 1a).
IMPROVEMENT OF THE PROFILE METHOD
CONSTRUCTION
There are currently several tools to construct efficient profiles
based on MSA (8). All these tools were designed to recover
10 very divergent proteins (<20% of similarity). They were
developed 10 years ago when protein databases were quite
small and very few representative genomes were sequenced.
There was thus a strong sample bias when constructing seed
alignments and profile tools that used these seeds needed to be
15strongly predictive. Currently, proteins databases are 10 times
bigger and thousands of genomes have been sequenced span-
ning the whole tree of life. It is now easier to have a seed
alignment with representatives of all possible variability and
descriptors can be more conservative. There is rather an
20increasing need for more specific descriptors in order to
have more precise functional information. As we described
previously, specific annotation can be assigned to a match with
a profile when looking in the matched region at the residue
level for the presence of particular amino acids at particular
25sites, such as enzymatic active sites, disulphide bridges, etc.
We thus have developed a new strategy to annotate the MSA at
these particular sites and to transfer this information to the

Figure 1. Output of the ScanProsite web page. (a) The left protein is a classical ephrin receptor protein (ephrin B4 receptor protein) which is known to transduce a
signal through its kinase domain (5). The right protein is also an ephrin receptor protein (human ephrin B6 receptor protein) but with an inactive kinase domain (6).
The ProRule associated with the kinase domain identifies an active site in ephrin B4 receptor but not in ephrin B6 receptor (absent feature: active site). The canonical
Asp residue at the active site position is replaced by a serine. (b) We used ScanProsite to identify orthologues of the ephrin B6 receptor in mammals, searching for
proteins that have the same domain arrangement and have a putative inactive kinase domain. (c) We also identified with ScanProsite an uncharacterized plant
subfamily of kinase receptors with a putative inactive kinase domain. The canonical aspartate residue at the active site position is replaced by a histidine. This kinase
subfamily is conserved in various plant genomes. Both multiple sequence alignments were generated on the ScanProsite web page using the alignment with the kinase
profile (PS50011).

profile builder program. Profile builder parameters can then be
adjusted according to the annotation. We have used this strat-
egy to adjust specific parameters in a column-dependant man-
ner. We have tested the weight of the matrix, gap and insertion
5 penalties. The tool aim is to be more stringent on specific
columns and to produce a better local alignment, which
then helps to re-localize the functional residues in sequences
matched by the profile.
