[1] Deep plasmaspheric notches can extend over more than 2 RE in radial distance and
3 hours MLT in the magnetic equatorial plane, as observed by the extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) imager on the IMAGE mission. They are among the largest evacuated features in
the exterior plasmaspheric boundary. They can last for days and exhibit a variety of
shapes. It appears that weak convection and limited erosion precedes notch formation at
the westward, near-Earth edge of the convection plume. Eighteen clear notch events were
found and analyzed in 2000. Among these events, notches were found to drift as
slowly as 44% of corotation. In only one case was a notch found to drift at the corotation
rate within measurement error. On average, these notches drift at about 21.5 h d1 or 90%
of the corotational rate. Notches sometimes exhibit an interior structure that appears
as an extended prominence of dense plasma, which forms a W- or M-like feature in
IMAGE/EUV images, depending on viewing perspective. Initial modeling suggests that
notches and notch prominences may be caused in part by intense small-scale potential
structures that result from the localized injection of ring current plasma. Plasma filling
rates during recovery are examined in three L shell ranges from L = 2 to L = 3.5 with rates
ranging from 5 to 140 cm3 d1. Plasma loss during a minor substorm is found to
extend to surprisingly low L shell with rates ranging from 100 to 130 cm3 d1 across the
L shells examined.

1. Introduction
[2] The plasmasphere, a relatively dense toroidal region
of cold plasma surrounding the Earth, has been studied for
many years [see Lemaire and Gringauz, 1998] and is
thought to play an important role in energetic particle
scattering and the transport of energy in the inner magne-
tosphere [e.g., Fok et al., 1993; Liemohn et al., 2000;
Khazanov et al., 2003]. Density structures on a variety
of scale sizes have been found in plasmaspheric plasma
[Carpenter et al., 2002; Sandel et al., 2003]. The outer
boundary of the plasmasphere, referred to as the plasma-
pause or plasmasphere boundary layer, is often characterized
by an abrupt one to two orders of magnitude drop in plasma
density. During extended geomagnetically quiet conditions
this region may lack a sharp boundary and instead exhibit a
density that gradually falls to trough levels. The most
significant azimuthal plasmaspheric structure is the plume,
which extends sunward in afternoon and evening local times.
The dominant mechanism for plume formation is the global
cross-tail electric field induced by the solar wind streaming
through the Earth’s outer magnetic field [Nishida, 1966;
Grebowsky, 1970]. Recently, it has become clear that the
details of plume structure are also dependent on more
localized electric fields [Foster et al., 2002; Goldstein et
al., 2004a, 2004b; Liemohn et al., 2004].
[3] Notches [Sandel et al., 2003] represent one of the
largest density structures in the plasmasphere, along with
the plasmasphere itself, the plasmaspheric plume, and
plasmaspheric channels. Notches may contribute to in situ
observations previously described as density cavities inside
the plasmasphere [Carpenter et al., 2002]. This possibility
was demonstrated by Green et al. [2002], where corotation
of a plasmaspheric notch in combination with orbital
satellite motion was found able to reproduce the in situ
measurement properties of an interior density cavity.
Notches have recently been found to play an important role
in the generation of kilometric continuum radiation [Green
et al., 2002, 2004], known for many years to be a perva-
sively observed plasma wave in the outer magnetosphere
low-density cavity.
[4] Notches are characterized by deep density depletions
that extend mostly radially inward to L = 2 or less. The sizes

in local time range from very narrow (0.1 hours MLT) to
very broad (3 hours MLT). Notch densities observed by
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) are found to be a factor of 5–
10 below the adjacent notch walls, although interior
notch densities often fall to the EUV noise level so that
notch depletions may be much deeper. Figure 1 shows three
examples of plasmaspheric notches. Each panel is a 10-min
integrated image acquired by the EUV camera on the
IMAGE mission. The camera observes 30.4 nm sunlight
resonantly scattered by He+ ions in the plasmasphere
[Sandel et al., 2000]. Counts increase logarithmically from
dark blue to bright blue and then white. The Earth is in the
center of each image and the bright arc close to the Earth is
ionospheric glow on the sunward side. Figure 1a shows a
structured notch toward the top of the image near dusk local
time. Notches sometimes include a central prominence of
enhanced plasma density that can be somewhat broad as in
this case or exceptionally narrow and extending radially
across two or more L shells within the notch. Figure 1b
shows one of the more narrow notches. This notch extends
from about L = 1.6 to L = 5.2 before it can no longer be seen
by the EUV instrument. Figure 1c shows a notch of similar
simple structure but much more broad in local time.
[5] All plasmaspheric densities and related quantities
presented in this work are for He+ ions, not total electron
density. An estimate of the helium to hydrogen ratio can be
obtained from the statistical study by Craven et al. [1997].
A discussion of the correspondence between IMAGE EUV
observations of helium ions and total electron density can be
found in the work by Goldstein et al. [2003]. In this second
study, a good correspondence was found between steep
density gradients observed in EUV images of He+ and those
inferred from upper hybrid resonant emissions measured by
the IMAGE Radio Plasma Imager [Reinisch et al., 2000]. It
is for that reason the He+ density gradients observed for
notches by the EUV instrument are assumed here to also
correspond to that for total electron density.
[6] The present work explores the origin of these deep,
large density cavities in the outer plasmasphere and their
evolution. Only clear, distinct notches observed during 2000
are examined here. The appearance of especially narrow
(in local time) notches is more subject to viewing geometry
and difficult to follow in time. Notchlike features that are
broad in local time, but shallow in L shell, may be related to
the notches explored here or may be related to another
morphological feature referred to as crenulations. Crenula-
tions are irregular features in plasmapause L shell whose
origins are unclear, although they appear to bear similarity
to shoulder features associated with overshielding and
undershielding in the inner magnetosphere [Goldstein et
al., 2002; Spasojevic´ et al., 2003]. It is found that notches
appear to share their origin with low-density channels,
which are formed during recovery at the base of the
plasmaspheric plume in the dusk region. Long-lived notches
present the opportunity to follow their refilling and motion
across a wide range of L shells. In one notch, refilling is
found to be consistent with previous early time refilling, but
responsive to a brief increase in magnetic activity. Notches
are also found to routinely drift eastward at a rate below
corotation [Sandel et al., 2003] and often at the same rate
across a wide range of inner L shells.
2. Origin of a Notch
2.1. Observational Evidence
[7] Figure 2 shows the plasmasphere near the start of
recovery from a period of enhanced convection. Each panel
shows a plume in the dusk region that will soon drift
eastward in the corotation direction. While otherwise
similar, the first two events on 31 May 2000 and 30 June
2000 precede the formation of a notch. The third event on
10 June 2000 results in an extended low-density channel.
These three event periods are shown again a short time later
in Figure 3. A much more clear difference has developed in
the plasma distribution between the first two (Figures 3a
and 3b) and the third event (Figure 3c) as shown from left to
right in Figure 3. The first two events develop into radial
notch structures, while the third event forms a low-density,
azimuthal channel inside a wrapped plume. Of the few
notches so far observed during formation, all appear to
originate at the westward edge and base of the convection
plume upon recovery from enhanced storm-time convec-
tion. The entrainment and wrapping of the convection
plume during storm-time recovery was first proposed by
Grebowsky [1970] and subsequently discussed in many
studies [see, e.g., Carpenter et al., 1992; Sandel et al.,
2001; Spasojevic´ et al., 2003]. The process results in an
azimuthally extended and radially narrow region of low
density inside a similarly extended region of enhanced
density that was once the sunward extended plume.
Figure 1. (a–c) Examples of plasmaspheric notches are
shown in EUV observations from 2000. Each panel is
shown with the day of year and universal time of the
observation. They are found to extend over two or more L
shells and to be as narrow as 0.1 MLT and as broad as
several hours MLT. Notches can be simple gaps in density
or contain structure such as the interior prominence shown
in Figure 1a.

[8] From EUV observations during 2000, notches appear
to originate during storm-time recovery in the same region
as low-density channels. Observationally, the distinction
between notch and low-density channel formation appears
to be due to the size and/or plasma content of the storm-time
plume and correspondingly to the degree of plasmaspheric
erosion. In order to illustrate these distinctions, two
periods of notch formation (Figures 2a and 2b and
Figures 3a and 3b) are compared to a period of low-density
channel formation (Figures 2c and 3c). The two notch

31 May 2000 and 30 June 2000 result in the formation of a notch. The day of 10 June 2000 results in the
formation of a low-density channel.

events are characterized by a thin plume and limited erosion
of the plasmasphere. Much more of the outer plasmasphere
was eroded in the channel event. With the aid of the cartoon
presented in Figure 4, we illustrate the observed differences
in notch and channel formation. In Figure 4, time proceeds
from left to right with notch formation shown across the
top of Figure 4 and channel formation across the bottom.
The upper sequence illustrates that limited plasmaspheric
erosion and smaller erosion plume leads to the formation of
a plasmaspheric notch, while more extensive plasmaspheric
erosion and plume are associated with the development
in recovery of a long, thin plume draped across the plasma-
sphere forming a low-density channel.
[9] Careful examination of the events shown in Figures 1a
and 3b reveal the presence of a thin wispy remnant of the
convection plume overdraping the notch density cavity.
While not always visible in EUV images, we hypothesize
that a remnant plume often remains, at least for a short
period of time after the formation of a notch. The details of
electric fields and other thermal plasma drivers that control
the distinction between notch and channel formation are left
to subsequent analysis. It should be noted that in some cases
extended low-density, channel-like structures are observed
to reorient into radial low-density notches. Likewise, EUV
has also observed features that were likely W-shaped
notches (see below) entrained within the eastward extent
of low-density channels. Also, while the residual azimuth-
ally draped plume in notch events quickly disappears
from EUV images, an observationally similar, but slower
disappearance is observed in the wrapped plumes that result
in low-density channels [Grebowsky, 1970; Chen and Wolf,
1972; Adrian et al., 2001].
[10] In order to more easily examine plasmaspheric
features and variations in plasma content over time, subse-
quently shown EUV images are projected into the dipole
magnetic equatorial plane and counts are transformed into
pseudodensity, where modeled variations in solar irradiance
at 30.4 nm and the most dominant systematic influences of
image intensity across the field of view are removed. This
analysis is discussed in Appendix A.
[11] A notch sometimes includes an interior azimuthally
narrow radial density enhancement, or prominence. An
example of such a prominence is shown in Figure 1a. In
this example, the prominence is nearly as broad as the
notch near the Earth and rapidly narrows in azimuth with
increasing L shell such that it forms something like a ‘‘W’’
in enhanced density. Although not visible in this rendering
of the event, prominences can sometimes be seen to extend
across the entire radial length of the notch and with a very
narrow azimuthal extent (0.1 RE).
[12] An interior prominence can be seen to form just after
notch formation during the event on 24 June 2000, which
is shown in Figure 5. Pseudodensity images mapped into
L shell versus MLT are shown at 30 min intervals over a
period of 2 hours. Only the 5-hour MLT region centered on
the notch is shown in each image. In the left most image the
notch has recently formed just westward of the recovering
convection plume. The notch walls become more radial
and distinct as the feature evolves leaving an enhanced
prominence near the notch center. While a definitive expla-
nation for the formation of a notch prominence is not yet
available, a candidate mechanism can be suggested.
2.2. Computational Explanation
[13] A possible mechanism for the formation of a plasma-
spheric notch and a prominence within a notch is intense,
small-scale electric field structures in the inner magneto-
sphere. This is best described by considering a few numer-
ical results. Figure 6 shows magnetic equatorial plane plots
of plasmaspheric density from the dynamic global core
plasma model (DGCPM) [Ober et al., 1997]. Results from

two simulations are shown, one with a prescribed convec-
tion electric field description (Figure 6a) and one with an
electric field that is self-consistently calculated from the
inner magnetospheric field-aligned currents produced by a
simulation of energetic ring current plasma (Figure 6b).
Both plots are for the same instant during the recovery
phase of the 17 April 2002 magnetic storm. Details of the
computational setup for these results are discussed by
Liemohn et al. [2004].
[14] Figure 6a yields the typical smoothly varying tear-
drop plasmapause with convection drainage plume mor-
phology first modeled by Grebowsky [1970]. Figure 6b
exhibits several features that resemble the plasmaspheric
notches seen in the IMAGE EUV data. At 15 LT there
is a small indentation in the plasmapause; near 18 LT is a
V-shaped depletion corresponding to the wrap of the
drainage plume around the storm-time plasmapause; and
at 21 LT is yet another depleted notch within the
wrapped up plume structure. These low-density regions
are not seen in Figure 6a. The initial conditions and the
ionospheric source and loss terms for these two simula-
tions are exactly the same; the only difference is the
convection electric field specification. The field yielding
the plasmasphere in Figure 6a is a well-behaved two-cell
convection pattern, while the field used to produce the
plasmasphere in Figure 6b is distorted from the standard
two-cell scenario by a rather large potential well near
midnight and several small-scale, transient electric poten-
tial vortices superposed on the main convection pattern.
[15] The electric potential vortices appear as a conse-
quence of the injection of hot plasma sheet ions into the ring
current region. Figure 7 gives a schematic illustration of this
process. Influxes of particles create localized pressure peaks
that must have field-aligned currents on the eastward and
westward ends of the peak to close the asymmetric ring
current loop. These field-aligned currents produce wells and
peaks (eastward and westward ends, respectively) in the
ionospheric electric potential pattern, which in turn can be
mapped back out to the magnetosphere and alter the plasma
flow through near-Earth space. The plasma motion is a
clockwise flow around the electric potential peak (westward
end) and a counterclockwise flow around the well (eastward
end). The net result is a radially outward flow between the
peak and the well and inward flows to the outside (in the
azimuthal direction) of the well-peak pair. As the hot ion
pressure peak drifts around the dusk side of the inner
magnetosphere, the associated potential structure will also
move westward through the region, eventually dissipating
on the dayside.
[16] The cold, plasmaspheric particles, which have
essentially no magnetic drift, are therefore a tracer of the
time history of the convective drift pattern. The formation of
a notch in the plasmapause greatly depends on the local
time location and extent of the hot ion injection. During a
storm, there are many successive injections from the plasma
sheet into the inner magnetosphere, which could cause
numerous indentations and undulations in the plasmapause.
Of course, this ring current-induced deformation of the
plasmapause is highly dependent on the ionospheric
conductance, which regulates the strength of the resulting
ionospheric potential pattern through Ohm’s law. This may
contribute to why notches appear during certain disturbed
times and not others. A more rigorous computational
analysis of notch formation is planned for the near future.
3. Notch Refilling
[17] The conversion of EUV observations to pseudoden-
sity, mapping into the magnetic equator, and tracking of
features makes it relatively easy to follow changes in notch
content as it evolves. Notches are often found to persist as
an identifiable structure for an extended period of time
[Sandel et al., 2003]. Figure 8 shows a sequence of images
that extends across the entire lifetime of a notch that formed
on 31 May 2000, during recovery from a moderate storm
(Kpmax = 4+). The first image was taken at 0859UT and is
shown in Figure 8 as 0000 hours. The following images to
the right show the time in hours and minutes relative to this
first image time. The notch remains a prominent feature for
nearly 32 hours before refilling. In order to estimate the
filling rate, weighted averages of pseudodensity in a region

2002 magnetic storm. The two results use (a) a smoothly
varying two-cell convection pattern and (b) a convection
pattern generated self-consistently from a concurrent ring
current simulation. The view is from over the north pole
with noon to the left and distances are given in RE.

each end (dark shaded regions within the light one). Electric
field vectors are shown by the shaded arrows, and the
corresponding drift flows are drawn with solid, dashed-line
arrows.

centered on the notch are computed and then followed in
time. The regions for which pseudodensity is averaged are
shown in the second panel of Figure 8 by the red boxes that
extend in 0.5 intervals from L = 2 to L = 3.5 and for one
hour on either side of the notch center. The weighting
function is the area represented by each image element in
the areas considered.
[18] The weighted density as a function of time for this
notch is shown in Figure 9 and is found to vary consider-
ably during the three IMAGE orbital passes when the notch
can be followed. During the first 5 hours and from the
innermost range to the outermost, refilling rates are 5.5 ±
21 cm3 d1, 46.8 ± 3.8 cm3 d1, and 49.4 ± 9.9 cm3 d1,
respectively. As can be seen, the densities for the
innermost L shell range are essentially constant, while
densities in the outer two L shell ranges rise at similar
rates. During this first orbital pass the notch is centered
between 18.1 hours and 21.8 hours MLT. During the second
pass the notch is located between 7.1 hours and 8.6 hours
MLT. While in this postdawn region the notch experiences a
modest increase in activity (Kp = 3) around 0000 UT on
1 June 2000. As a consequence, plasma is lost throughout
the notch during this period of modest activity with loss
rates of 101 ± 45.5 cm3 d1, 128 ± 29 cm3 d1, and
128 ± 29 cm3 d1, respectively. Refilling is found again
during the third orbital pass when the notch is centered from
19.9 hours to 23.3 hours MLT. Refilling rates are 75 ±
18 cm3 d1, 139 ± 14 cm3 d1, and 80 ± 11 cm3 d1.
Unlike at the beginning of the observational period, there is
clear refilling across the whole L shell range during this
time period. As is expected, the averaged densities across all
times are highest for L shells in the range 2.0  L  2.5 and
lowest in the range 3.0  L  3.5.
[19] The refilling rates derived from the EUV notch obser-
vations are similar to the refilling rate of 80 cm3 d1 for
L = 4.5 obtained by Carpenter et al. [1993]. Park [1973]
obtained a somewhat lower value of 30–40 cm3 d1 for L =
4.5, while Chappell [1974] obtained a rate of 50 cm3 d1
for L = 4. At geosynchronous orbit Lawrence et al. [1999]
measured an early time refilling at a rate of 0.6–12 cm3
d1 and a later time refilling rate of 10–50 cm3 d1. By
using a dipole magnetic field, an estimate of50 difference
in flux tube volume and hence refilling rate might be antic-
ipated between the Lawrence et al. [1999] observations and
those presented here. On the basis of that estimate, our early
recovery time refilling rates are comparable to those found at
geosynchronous orbit [see also De´cre´au, 1983, 1986; Higel
and Wu, 1984; Song et al., 1988].
4. Notch Drift
[20] In addition to following the refilling of plasma-
spheric flux tubes, the cross-field drifts of 18 notches have
been tracked. The MLT location of notch centers near L = 2.5
are first approximated manually. These locations are then
used as initial conditions for a least squares Gaussian
function fit to the azimuthal notch profile. The Gaussian-
derived notch centers are then followed in time. Table 1
shows the azimuthal drift rates as hours per day. A feature
drifting with the Earth’s rotation would be shown at a rate of
24 hours per day. Only one notch was observed to corotate
with the Earth; the one observed on 28 May 2000. Most of
the remaining notches drift at a rate between 85% and 97%
of corotation. Two notches observed from 21–23 December
2000 were found to drift considerably slower at 44% and
74% the corotation rate, respectively. Figure 10 shows an
example of a notch that could be followed for three days.
The symbols show the MLT location of the (Gaussian-
derived) notch center during the observational period. The
solid line is a linear fit to the notch centers, which gives a
drift rate that is 91% of the corotation rate. Were the notch
to strictly corotate with the Earth, its location would follow
the dotted line. While this notch was followed for a longer
time than usual, the ability to approximate its subcorotation
with a linear function is typical. Even when minor varia-

plotted for the event shown in Figure 8. Weighted averages
are computed for the 0.5 L and 2 hour bins that follow the
notch center. Shaded bars correspond to linear fits to each
segment of average densities, indicating an initial gradual
increase, then minor storm-related decrease, and then more
pronounced increase at the end of the event.

throughout its life. Times shown are relative to the time
of the first image of 0831 UT on this day. It can be seen that
the notch extends across roughly 2 RE in radial distance and
2 hours MLT in EUV images. A weighted average of
plasmaspheric pseudodensity is computed for each image
across the three regions illustrated by the box outlines
shown on the image at 0140 hours.

tions away from a linear fit are found, an overall linear drift
with time dominates the behavior of a notch. In addition,
notches often substantially maintain their spatial shape
during their lifetime. Some of the apparent changes in
notch structure may be attributed to changes in observing
geometry. A closer examination of the evolution of notch
shape is left for subsequent study.
[21] Burch et al. [2004] have proposed that subcorotation
of the plasmasphere is driven by subcorotation of the
ionosphere. They go on to propose that the ionospheric
disturbance dynamo drives ionospheric motion relative to
corotation as described by Blanc and Richmond [1980].
Burch et al. [2004] tested their hypothesis by comparing
ionospheric drift measurements from the DMSP spacecrafts
against EUV derived plasmaspheric drift. The present notch
measurements offer another opportunity to test this hypoth-
esis. Ion Drift Meter (IDM) observations from the DMSP
spacecraft numbers F12, F13, and F15 have been used to
obtain average drift for time periods when a DMSP orbit
passes within the L shell range 2  L 3 and within 2 hours
MLTof the notch location as observed by IMAGEEUV. IDM
drift measurements during these conjunctions are aver-
aged and included in Table 1. The relative correspon-
dence between derived notch drift rates and ionospheric
drift rates can be seen in Figure 11. Within the margin of
error, most average ionospheric drifts are consistent with
notch drift.
[22] Notably, that is not true for all cases. One such case,
for 24–25 June 2000, is highlighted in Figure 12. Here,
individual IDM drift measurements are compared to the
derived linear notch drift. IDM drift measurements are
shown in Figure 12 (top) where each symbol is an iono-
spheric drift measurement. Each grouping of symbols
results from multiple IDM measurements during one DMSP
pass near the notch location. The dotted line corresponds to
corotation. The solid red line is the linear drift of the notch
derived from EUV. Ionospheric drift rates are systematically
slower that that of the notch. In Figure 12 (bottom)
the relative magnetic longitude of the notch, in hours, is
plotted through the observational period. The solid line is
the linear fit. The dotted line indicates strict corotation. The
plasmaspheric drift indicated by EUV is easily more than
one standard deviation from the average ionospheric drift
from IDM. That is also true for the notch observed on 3–
5 July 2000.
[23] A possible explanation for the differences found
between IDM and EUV drifts might be due to magnetic
local time differences in the observations. As stated above,
the IDM measurements included in ionospheric drift
averages are within 2 hours MLT of the IMAGE spacecraft

location. Should there exist variation in ionospheric drift on
smaller azimuthal scales, then the different drifts found here
do not contradict the ionospheric slippage proposed by
Burch et al. [2004]. In an attempt to test that possibility,
IDM measurements have been resampled for the June 2000
notch with much more strict MLT criteria for correspon-
dence. In this case, DMSP was required to be within
0.5 hours MLT of the EUV-observed notch at the time of
the observation in addition to being between L = 2 and L = 3.
Three of the nine DMSP orbital passes shown in Figure 12
are within 0.5 hours MLT of the notch center. The drifts
measured by IDM are still easily lower in drift rate than that
obtained from the EUV instrument. The IDM measurements
were obtained from the University of Texas at Dallas
and include quality flags that are intended to reflect the
likelihood that IDM measurements accurately reflect
ionospheric drifts. Only those measurements assigned the
highest-quality flag were included in this study. While the
other DMSP average drifts are statistically consistent with
the notch drifts derived here, there remains considerable
scatter in DMSP drift values.
[24] As mentioned above, it is not uncommon to find the
observed short-term notch location to drift somewhat slower
and faster than the long-term trend, but identification of a
long-term trend appears well justified. Green and red colors
are used in Figure 12 to represent notch location in and out
of sunlight, respectively. This annotation was applied to the
analysis of all events for the purpose of revealing whether
the day/night changes in ionospheric conductivity might
contribute to a diurnally varying slippage of the notch
location relative to the long-term drift. No such dependence
was found. Observational geometry was also considered as
a possible source of apparent short-term shifts in notch
position. In a format similar to Figure 12, the spacecraft
angular location relative to the plane of the notch and the
rate of spacecraft motion transverse to the plane of the notch
were examined along side the short-term shifts in notch
position relative to the long-term trend. The idea here is that
an observing location out of the plane of a notch might
result in a systematic error in locating the notch in magnetic
longitude. Similarly, the rate of motion of the observing
location toward or away from the notch might lead to a
systematic increase or decrease of the apparent rate of
motion of a notch. Again, no such systematic correlation
could be found to explain these short-term shifts.
[25] Another explanation for the notch (and, in general,
plasmaspheric) subcorotation is the dawn-dusk asymmetry
of the electric potential pattern [e.g., Lu et al., 1989;
Boonsiriseth et al., 2001; Ridley et al., 2004]. For instance,
Lu et al. [1989] found that the potential difference from the
pole to the equator along the dusk meridian is typically
1.5 times larger than the potential difference along the
dawn meridian. Ridley et al. [2004] explained this asym-
metry as a result of the Hall conductance gradient at the
terminators. In a three-dimensional Ohm’s law [Amm, 1996],
there is a term proportional to the product of the meridional
(north-south) electric field and the azimuthal (east-west)
gradient of the Hall conductance. The net effect of this term
is to reduce the magnitude of the dawnside potential peak and
increase the size of the duskside potential well (compare
Ridley et al. [2004, Plates 4 and 6]). For nominal, nonstorm-
time conductance values, Ridley et al. [2004] found that the
duskside potential minimum was 23% larger than the dawn-
side potential maximum. A similar term in Ohm’s law that
includes the azimuthal gradient of the Pedersen conductance
yields an asymmetry of only 1% or 2% in the opposite
direction (that is, a bigger dawnside peak). The potential
pattern asymmetry results in a stronger sunward convection
on the duskside of the magnetosphere than on the dawnside,
which is a difference not accounted for in standard two-cell
convection patterns. The symmetric convection scenario
leads to subcorotative flow on the duskside and supercor-
otative flow on the dawnside, with no net influence of
convection on the drift period along closed drift paths (in
steady state). However, the convective asymmetry creates a
larger decrease on the duskside and a smaller increase on the
dawnside, resulting in drift periods longer than 24 hours (that
is, subcorotation). Liemohn et al. [2004] show that the inner
magnetospheric component of the dawn-dusk asymmetry
varies with storm phase (in the self-consistent electric field
results), indicating that the subcorotation effect is modulated
by field-aligned current and conductance variations. The
disturbance dynamo discussed by Burch et al. [2004] also
causes subcorotative drift periods. Both effects will cause the
same net westward flow in the DMSP drift data. A determi-
nation of the relative contribution of these two effects is
beyond the scope of this paper and intended for a later study.
5. Discussion and Conclusions
[26] Notches are one of the remarkable large-scale struc-
tural features of the plasmasphere, only recognized after

flight of the remote sensing EUV instrument on the IMAGE
spacecraft. Notches are characterized by nearly radial
cavities in plasma density that often extend over 2 RE in
the magnetic equator and from a tenth of an hour to two
hours or more in MLT. The notch density cavity can extend
inward to L = 1.6 or less and is sometimes found to be
transiently ‘‘capped’’ at the outer plasmaspheric boundary
by a thin, residual plasmaspheric plume. Excavation of
plasmaspheric densities to such low altitudes is remarkable
by itself and cannot be explained by global convection as
evidenced in the work of Carpenter and Anderson [1992].
We speculate here that mesoscale electric field structures,
possibly resulting from localized storm-time injection, are
necessary to create these spatially deep features. Densities in
a notch can be at least a factor of 5–10 lower than the
adjacent notch walls. Notches appear to form following
weak periods of enhanced convection on the westward edge
and base of the plasmaspheric plume. They can maintain
their form for several days during quite conditions. Notches
are also capable of loosing plasma while maintaining shape
during subsequent weak periods of increased magnetic
activity.
[27] A central enhanced density prominence was found in
about 22% of the notches identified in 2000. On 24 June
2000, a prominence was observed to form soon after or with
formation of a notch. Evidence is presented here that this
prominence may be indicative of a spatially localized
injection of plasma sheet ions and the formation of en-
hanced mesoscale regions of opposite electric potential.
These small-scale potential enhancements appear capable
of locally drawing plasma out of the interior high-density
region into the low-density notch through modification of
the E  B convection pattern. As discussed above, such
small-scale potential structures may also result in localized
inward convection of plasma, possibly leading to the low
L shell penetration of notch features. Although not
presented, notch prominences do not necessarily stay
centered in the notch even though the notch itself main-
tains its general shape. In two cases, interior prominences
are observed to drift westward relative to the notch, later
merging with the notch interior wall.
[28] The large, low-density region of a notch lends itself
to the study of plasmaspheric refilling and examination of
cross-field drift over extended periods of time. One refilling
period was examined closely. During the event on 31 May
and 1 June 2000, early changes in average density in the
innermost L shell range are somewhat mixed with little
overall refilling. The middle and outer L shell range,
however, show a similar rate of refilling in the range of
47–49 cm3 d1. Refilling between 2 and 3 times this rate
is observed during the third IMAGE orbital pass in all L
shell ranges. This last period of early time refilling is
observed when the densities are higher than that present
for the first orbital pass observing period. These refilling
ranges are consistent with those reported by Lawrence et al.
[1999] and others as discussed above.
[29] Of some interest is the loss of plasma in the inner-
most L shell range (2.0  L  2.5) during the modest
increase in magnetic activity to Kp = 3 near the start of 1
June 2000. On the basis of Carpenter and Anderson [1992],
the plasmapause might be expected to erode inward to L = 3
for this level of activity. However, essentially the same rate
of plasma loss is seen inside that L shell as is seen outside.
Convective plasma loss cannot explain what is found inside
of L = 3. Carpenter [1962] is the first to report this type of
plasma loss inside a storm-time plasmapause. Drainage into
the ionosphere is another avenue for plasma loss, which was
first proposed by Park [1973]. This dayside plasma loss
may also relate to the nightside density loss inside the
storm-time eroded plasmapause found by Carpenter
[1995]. Successful explanation of this low L shell plasma-
spheric erosion will also need to operate near dawn as
found here.
[30] As a plasmaspheric feature extended in L shell,
notches directly support the examination of convective drift
across a significant range of L shells. Table 1 summarizes
our findings for 18 notches observed during 2000. Only one
of these notches was found to drift with the rotation of the
Earth. In two cases, the plasmasphere drifted much slower,
as slow as 44% of corotation. We find that a notch most
often drifts eastward at a rate of 85–97% of corotation. The
only conclusion we can reach is that the plasmasphere
usually lags corotational motion; however, the slippage is
often not large. Burch et al. [2004] has suggested that
westward ionospheric drift is responsible for slowing the
corotational motion of the plasmasphere. Just as in this
cited study, we have obtained IDM ionospheric drift mea-
surements for 12 of 18 notches. One standard deviation
error estimates for these ionospheric drifts suggest that most
are consistent with our notch drift rates.
[31] For two of the notches studied here, the IDM drift
rates are significantly slower than found using EUV. The
implication is that the explanation for subcorotational drift
of the plasmasphere may be more complex than currently
thought. In this regard, we note the works of Lu et al.
[1989], Boonsiriseth et al. [2001], Ridley et al. [2004], and
Liemohn et al. [2004] may provide an additional explana-
tion for subcorotational drift. These works collectively
suggest that Hall conductance gradients at the terminators
cause a dawn-dusk electric potential asymmetry, yielding
a net subcorotational plasmaspheric drift that is storm
phase–dependent.
Appendix A
[32] Observed EUV instrument counts are converted to
column density [Sandel, private communication] using the
following equation (A1):
N ¼ a1:891019=F ; ðA1Þ
where N is the He+ column abundance in cm2, a is
the EUV signal in counts/pixel for a 10-min integration, and
F is the solar irradiance at 30.4 nm in units of photons 
cm2  s1. Solar irradiance is obtained from the
SOLAR2000 irradiance model [Tobiska, 2004].
[33] Column integrated density is converted to pseudo-
density by dividing by an estimate of the distance along the
line of sight that contributes most to the image intensity at
each location in the field of view. Because of rapidly falling
densities in the plasmasphere with increasing L shell, the
innermost regions penetrated by a given line of sight will
contribute most to the observed 30.4 nm intensity [Sandel et
al., 2003]. The EUV imager spatial resolution in the
A09201 GALLAGHER ET AL.: ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF PLASMASPHERIC NOTCHES

equatorial plane while observing from apogee is about 0.1
RE, therefore that distance along the line of sight when
passing within 0.1 RE of the innermost L shell reached is
divided into the column integrated density for each position
in the EUV field of view. A sketch describing this influence
is shown in Figure A1 along with a typical example of how
this effective integration length changes with line of sight
below a high-latitude observing location.
[34] By choosing observing periods when the IMAGE
spacecraft is at high latitude (>60 degrees magnetic latitude)
and relatively far from perigee (>4 RE geocentric distance),
the regions dominating the intensities observed in EUV
images are relatively close to the magnetic equator. Rela-
tively little change in density within the plasmasphere is
anticipated along magnetic field lines near the equator
[Gallagher et al., 2000; Reinisch et al., 2004], therefore
EUV images are next mapped to the dipole magnetic
equator [Sandel et al., 2003]. Dipole coordinates are used,
since distortions from dipole are small close to the Earth
during the periods of quiet geomagnetic activity examined
in this study.
[35] The quantitative accuracy of the pseudodensity
calculation has been tested by comparison to a known
density. The dynamic global core plasma model (DGCPM)
[Ober et al., 1997] was used to simulate a storm-time
recovery period on 10 June 2001. The simulation resulted
in a nightside, narrow plume and otherwise normal plasma-
sphere with a relatively sharp plasmapause boundary. This
equatorial distribution of plasma was then used to define
densities along the magnetic field. This run of DGCPM
does not include an ionosphere and is limited to modeling L
shells beyond 2; therefore no model ionosphere is included
in this test. Simulated EUV images through this modeled
environment were then produced for satellite positions at a
distance of 8 RE and at magnetic latitudes of 60, 70, 80,
and 90. Pseudodensities where then computed for each
image and compared to the original density distribution.
Accuracy improved notably with increasing latitude, espe-
cially in the region viewed on the far side of the Earth. Most
derived densities are within about 50% of the original, but
vary by as much as a factor of nearly 10 in localized
regions. Density at a sharp plasmapause tended to be
underestimated. Densities just inside the plasmaspheric
plume, in a low-density channel overdraped by the plume,
are overestimated. Naturally, densities in the Earth’s shadow
are underestimated by the pseudodensity calculation.
