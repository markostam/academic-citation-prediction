Ablation of Cardiac Myosin-Binding Protein-C Accelerates
Stretch Activation in Murine Skinned Myocardium
Julian E. Stelzer, Sandy B. Dunning, Richard L. Moss
Abstract—Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a thick filament accessory protein that binds tightly to myosin,
but despite evidence that mutations in the cMyBP-C gene comprise a frequent cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
relatively little is known about the role(s) of cMyBP-C in myocardium. Based on earlier studies demonstrating the
potential importance of stretch activation in cardiac contraction, we examined the effects of cMyBP-C on the stretch
activation responses of skinned ventricular preparations from wild-type (WT) and homozygous cMyBP-C knockout
mice (cMyBP-C/) previously developed in our laboratory. Sudden stretch of skinned myocardium during maximal or
submaximal Ca2 activations resulted in an instantaneous increase in force that quickly decayed to a minimum and was
followed by a delayed redevelopment of force (ie, stretch activation) to levels greater than prestretch force. Ablation of
cMyBP-C dramatically altered the stretch activation response, ie, the rates of force decay and delayed force transient
were accelerated compared with WT myocardium. These results suggest that cMyBP-C normally constrains the spatial
position of myosin cross-bridges, which, in turn, limits both the rate and extent of interaction of cross-bridges with actin.
We propose that ablation of cMyBP-C removes this constraint, increases the likelihood of cross-bridge binding to actin,
and speeds the rate of delayed force development following stretch. Regardless of the specific mechanism, acceleration
of cross-bridge cycling in cMyBP-C/ myocardium could account for the abbreviation of systolic ejection in this mouse
as a direct consequence of premature stretch activation of ventricular myocardium. (Circ Res. 2006;98:1212-1218.)
Key Words: cross-bridge kinetics  cooperativity  contractile proteins  regulation of contraction
Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) in humans isan inherited autosomal dominant disease that, in most
cases, is caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins. Muta-
tions in one sarcomeric protein, cardiac myosin binding
protein-C (cMyBP-C), have been reported to be among the
most common causes of FHC,1–3 and yet relatively little is
known about its function. To better understand the role of
cMyBP-C in myocardial contraction, we previously devel-
oped a cMyBP-C–null mouse (cMyBP-C/) specifically
lacking cMyBP-C.4 cMyBP-C/ mice exhibit severe ventric-
ular hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction evident in abbreviation
of ejection and reduced stroke volume, and diastolic dysfunc-
tion seen as a decreased rate of isovolumic relaxation.4,5 The
present study was undertaken to determine the effects of
ablation of cMyBP-C on the dynamic mechanical properties
of myocardium to understand the basis for functional deficits
in the cMyBP-C/ mouse.
During both the isovolumic and ejection phases of systole,
the left ventricle undergoes significant torsional deformation
as the apex twists counterclockwise (as viewed from the
apex) relative to the base,6 with the endocardium exhibiting
greater torsional strain than the epicardium.7 Such a differ-
ential in torsional strain across the ventricular wall might be
expected to modulate systolic force generation and the timing
of force production in different parts of the wall. Because
higher force regions would stretch lower force regions during
torsional twist, there should be stretch activation (delayed
development of force) of subendocardial myocardium, simi-
lar to the delayed development of force developed by isolated
cardiac muscle following stretch.8 Stretch activation may thus
play a role in myocardial power generation and systolic
ejection.9 In this regard, a recent study showed that the rate
and amplitude of the stretch activation response in mouse
myocardium varies with the level of activation, suggesting
that the response to stretch likely is regulated on a beat-to-
beat basis.10,11
Given the systolic dysfunction evident in the cMyBP-C/
mouse, we hypothesized that the stretch activation response
in cMyBP-C/ myocardium would be reduced or absent and
thereby account for reduced systolic ejection. Myosin binding
protein-C (MyBP-C) is bound to thick filaments in distinct
stripes (between 7 to 11) in the C-zone of the A-bands in each
half sarcomere.12 The C terminus of MyBP-C contains a
binding domain,13 with high affinity for myosin subfragment-
214 and the myosin molecule contains sites for binding
MyBP-C within the S2 and light meromyosin (LMM) frag-
ments.15,16 Because the periodicity of MyBP-C17 is very
similar to that of myosin (42.9 nm18) and it binds to myosin

in a functionally important region, it is plausible that
cMyBP-C plays an important role in the regulation of
cross-bridge movement and interaction with actin, as sug-
gested previously.19–21
To explore whether the reduced ejection fraction observed
in cMyBP-C/ hearts is attributable to alterations in stretch
activation, we compared stretch activation responses in wild-
type (WT) and cMyBP-C/ myocardium. Contrary to our
initial hypothesis that stretch activation in cMyBP-C/ myo-
cardium is reduced or absent, we observed no change in the
amplitude of stretch activation, which by itself is not consis-
tent with depressed systolic function in the null mouse.
However, the rate of rise of force during delayed force
development was substantially faster than in WT myocardi-
um, such that the earlier than normal stretch activation
response could account for the premature cessation of ejec-
tion observed in cMyBP-C/ mice.
Materials and Methods
Transgenic Mice
Homozygous cardiac MyBP-C–null (cMyBP-C/) mice were gen-
erated previously4 and maintained in a breeding colony. For exper-
imental measurements, adult mice (3 to 6 months of age) of either
sex were used. Aged-matched WT mice of the same background
strain as cMyBP-C/ mice (SV/129; Taconic Farms, Germantown,
NY) were used as controls. All procedures involving animal use
were performed according to institutional guidelines approved by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Care
International (AAALAC).
Solutions
Solution compositions were calculated using the computer program
developed by Fabiato22 and the stability constants listed by Godt and
Lindley23 corrected to pH 7.0 and 22°C. All solutions contained
(in mmol/L) 100 N,N-bis(2 hydroxy-ethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid (BES), 15 creatine phosphate, 5 dithiothreitol, 1 free Mg2, and
4 MgATP. In addition, pCa 9.0 solution contained (in mmol/L) 7
EGTA and 0.02 CaCl2, pCa 4.5 contained 7 EGTA and 7.01 CaCl2,
and preactivating solution contained 0.07 EGTA. Ionic strength of all
solutions was adjusted to 180 mmol/L with potassium propionate.
Solutions containing different amounts of [Ca2]free were prepared by
mixing appropriate volumes of stock solutions of pCa 9.0 and pCa 4.5.
Skinned Myocardial Preparations
Skinned ventricular myocardium for stretch activation experiments
was prepared as previously described.24 Briefly, following IP injec-
tion of 5000 U heparin/kg body weight, S129 WT mice (3 to 6
months old) were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (15% isoflu-
rane in mineral oil) in accordance with institutional animal care
guidelines. Their hearts were excised and right and left ventricles
were dissected at room temperature in a relaxing solution containing
(in mmol/L) 100 KCl, 20 imidazole, 7 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, and 4
MgATP (pH 7.0) and were then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. To
prepare skinned myocardial preparations, the frozen ventricles were
thawed and homogenized in relaxing solution for 2 seconds using
a Polytron, which yielded multicellular preparations of 100 to
250 m600 to 900 m. The homogenate was centrifuged at 120g
for 1 minute and the resulting pellet was washed with fresh relaxing
solution and resuspended in relaxing solution containing 250 g/mL
saponin and 1% Triton X-100. After 30 minutes, the skinned
preparations were washed with fresh relaxing solution and were
dispersed in 50 mL of relaxing solution in a glass Petri dish. The
dish was kept on ice at all times, except during the selection of
individual preparations for mechanical experiments.
Apparatus and Experimental Protocol
Skinned preparations with well-defined edges and no evident free
ends in the middle region were transferred from the Petri dish to a
stainless steel experimental chamber25 containing relaxing solution.
The ends of a preparation were attached to the arms of a motor
(model 312B, Aurora Scientific Inc) and force transducer (model
403; Aurora Scientific Inc), as described earlier.25 The chamber
assembly was then placed on the stage of an inverted microscope
(Carl Zeiss) fitted with a 40 objective and a closed-circuit
television camera (model WV-BL600, Panasonic). Bitmap images of
the preparations were acquired using an AGP 4X/2X graphics card
and associated software (ATI Technologies Inc) and were used to
assess mean sarcomere length during the course of each experiment.
Changes in force and motor position were sampled (16-bit resolu-
tion, DAP5216a; Microstar Laboratories, Bellevue, Wash) at 2.0 kHz
using SLControl software developed in our laboratory26 and saved to
computer files for later analysis. Fiber force during the experiments
was also recorded on a digital oscilloscope (Nicolet Instrument
Corporation, Madison, Wis).
At the start of each experiment, the preparations were stretched to
a mean sarcomere length of 2.12 m, such that resting force was
minimal for measurements of steady-state Ca2-activated force and
stretch activation. The preparations were initially activated at pCa
4.5 to establish the maximal tension (Po), and then force was
recorded in pCa 9.0 to establish the resting force, which was then
subtracted from the total force in activating solutions to yield the
Ca2-activated force (P). For stretch activation experiments, fibers
were activated in pCa solutions, yielding maximum force (pCa 4.5),
50% of maximum force, and 25% of maximum force. When
steady-state tension was reached, a rapid stretch of 1% fiber length
(Lo) was imposed and held for 5 seconds before returning the fiber to
pCa 9.0.
The stretch activation variables measured are shown in Figure 1.
All amplitudes were normalized to prestretch isometric tension to
allow comparisons between different levels of activation. Ampli-
tudes were measured as follows: P1, measured from prestretch
steady-state force to the peak of phase 1; P2, measured from
prestretch steady-state force to the minimum force decay; P3,

um. The force transient shown (bottom) is typical of typical
stretch activation responses of WT myocardium following a
stretch of 1% of muscle length (top). Once a steady-state iso-
metric force of 50% of maximal was achieved in the presence
of Ca2, the muscle was stretched and then held at the longer
length for 5 seconds. The stretch activation response was mul-
tiphasic, as reported previously.10 The recorded variables are
labeled on the force record and described in the text.

measured from prestretch steady-state force to the peak value of
delayed force; and Pdf, difference between P3 and P2.
Apparent rate constants were derived for phase 2 (krel, sec1) from
the force decay following the peak of phase 1 and for phase 3 (kdf,
sec1) from the point of force reuptake following phase 2 to the
completion of delayed force development.
Data Analysis
Cross-sectional areas of skinned preparations were calculated by
assuming that the preparations were cylindrical and by measuring
width of the mounted preparation. Submaximal Ca2-activated force
(P) was expressed as a fraction of the maximum Ca2-activated force
(Po) generated at pCa 4.5, ie, P/Po. Rate constants of force decay were
obtained by fitting a single exponential to the time course of decay,
ie, ya(1-exp[k1x]), where a is the amplitude of the single
exponential phase and k1 is the rate constant of decay. Rate constants
of delayed force development were obtained by a double exponential
fit, yaexp(k1x)bexp(k2x), where a is the amplitude of the
first exponential phase that rises with rate constant k1 and b is the
amplitude of the second exponential phase rising with rate constant
of k2, or were estimated by linear transformation of the half-time of
force redevelopment, ie, k1ln0.5(t1/2)1.10
All data are reported as meansSEM. Comparisons of stretch
activation variables between WT and cMyBP-C/ myocardium at
different levels of activation were performed using a 1-way ANOVA
with a Tukey post hoc test, with statistical significance set at
P0.05.
Results
Response of WT and cMyBP-C/ Mouse
Ventricular Myocardium to Stretch
Figure 1 illustrates a typical response of WT mouse skinned
myocardium to a rapid stretch of 1% of initial muscle length
during Ca2 activation that yielded a prestretch force of
50% maximal. The initial rapid increase in force (phase 1)
is coincident with stretch and is caused by strain of attached
cross-bridges27; phase 1 is followed by a rapid decline in
force (phase 2) and a delayed force recovery (phase 3) that
persists for several seconds before ultimately decaying to the
original isometric force. Amplitudes of these phases are
indicated in Figure 1 as P1, P2, and P3. Note that P2 (the
minimum at the end of force decay) can fall below prestretch
isometric force and can have negative values, whereas P1
(phase1 amplitude) and P3 (phase 3 amplitude) are always
positive. The values of P1 in this study were likely underes-
timated because our data sampling rate was limited, but this
variable was not studied in this work.
To allow comparisons of stretch activation responses in
WT and cMyBP-C/ myocardium at different levels of
activation, stretch activation amplitudes were normalized to
prestretch isometric force (Figures 2 and 3). The amplitude of
phase 1 (P1) increased as prestretch isometric force increased
and did not differ significantly between WT and cMyBP-C/
myocardium (Figure 2) within the time resolution of our force
transducer. In WT myocardium P2 amplitude was lowest at
maximal activation and highest (most positive) at low levels
of activation, whereas P2 values in cMyBP-C/ myocardium
were almost always negative and dipped below isometric
force at all levels of activation (Figure 3). The dramatic
differences in P2 amplitude at submaximal levels of activation
can be clearly seen when the stretch activation responses of
WT and cMyBP-C/ myocardium are superimposed at
activation levels of 50% (Figure 4). The amplitudes of P1
and P2 were not corrected for resting force, which in each
preparation was less than 5% of the maximum active force at
pCa 4.5.
The rapid force decay in phase 2 proceeds with an apparent
rate constant krel and is thought to represent detachment of
cross-bridges that are strained by stretch and their rapid
replacement by unstrained cross-bridges.28,29 The apparent
rate constant of force decay (krel) was slightly faster as the
level of activation decreased for both WT and cMyBP-C/
(Figure 5) and was dramatically faster in cMyBP-C/ myo-
cardium at submaximal levels of activation (Figure 4).
The net delayed recruitment of cross-bridges following
stretch can be determined from the amplitude of P3, which has
been shown to be highly dependent on prestretch isometric
force.10,30 Normalized values of P3 decreased as a function of
increased activation level such that proportionately fewer
cross-bridges were recruited by stretch at higher levels of
activation, a phenomenon that did not differ between WT and
cMyBP-C/ myocardium at any level of activation. How-

muscle length were recorded in WT (top) and cMyBP-C/ (bot-
tom) myocardium. In each case, the force responses were nor-
malized to the prestretch isometric force recorded at the same
level of activation, ie, the prestretch force baseline corresponds
to P/Po1.00 in A and D (maximal activation), P/Po0.52 in B
and E (intermediate activation), level activation, and P/Po0.25
in C and 0.27 in F (low activation).

ever, the negative amplitudes of P2 in cMyBP-C/ myocar-
dium increased the overall amplitude of the phase 3 tension
transient compared with WT, as indicated by the large
increase in Pdf for cMyBP-C/ (Figure 6).
The stretch activation response (phase 3) does not occur as
a simple exponential process10,30 and thus does not fit well
with a single exponential equation, especially at low levels of
activation. To facilitate comparisons of phase 3 rates of force
development (kdf) at different levels of activation, apparent
rate constants were derived from the half-times of force
development.10,30 As previously reported,10 apparent rate
constants of force development (kdf) in murine myocardium
are activation dependent, increasing with level of prestretch
isometric force (Table). Because kdf is generally thought to
involve the cooperative recruitment of cross-bridges into
strongly bound states,29,31,32 the acceleration of kdf at high
levels of activation can be understood in terms of an increased
number of cross-bridges bound to the thin filament, leaving
fewer cross-bridges available for recruitment following
stretch, thereby reducing the amplitude of stretch activation
(as a fraction of prestretch force) and increasing its rate. In the
present study, there was no difference in kdf between WT and
cMyBP-C/ myocardium at maximal activation, but kdf was
significantly accelerated at submaximal levels of activation in
cMyBP-C/ compared with WT myocardium (Figure 4 and
the Table), suggesting that cMyBP-C ablation accelerated the
recruitment of cross-bridges into force generating states,
thereby accelerating the overall rate of the stretch activation
response.

Discussion
This study was undertaken to investigate the role of
cMyBP-C in cardiac contraction and to specifically determine
how ablation of cMyBP-C leads to impairment of cardiac
function. Earlier in vivo measurements of left ventricular
function showed that cMyBP-C/ mouse hearts have re-
duced ejection, an abbreviated ejection phase, and decreased
rates of relaxation compared with WT controls.4,5 The overall
depression of systolic function in null mice occurs despite
a normal initial rise in maximal pressure development
(dP/dtmax), presumably because the period of ejection is
shortened, thereby reducing the volume of blood ejected.
Paradoxically, cMyBP-C/ myocardium exhibits accelerated
rates of force development and increased power at submaxi-
mal levels of activation,33 possibly as a consequence of
enhanced levels of thin filament activation. We have previ-
ously suggested that ablation of cMyBP-C increases cooper-
ative activation of the thin filament because of increased
likelihood of cross-bridge binding.34 Structural models for
such a mechanism emerge from consideration of possible
interactions of cMyBP-C with myosin because cMyBP-C has
been proposed to restrict myosin interaction with actin by
tethering the myosin heads to the thick filament19 or by
forming a collar around the backbone of the thick filament.3
Ablation of cMyBP-C would alleviate the constraints on the
position of myosin and lead to an increased probability of
cross-bridge formation and acceleration of the transition of
cross-bridges to force generating states. The resulting upregu-
lation of thin filament activation, or a reduced ability to
inactivate the thin filament, can lead to slowed relaxation,
which would decrease both the diastolic filling time and the
end diastolic volume, ultimately decreasing ejection fraction
and depressing overall systolic function.
The stretch activation response is critical to the generation
of oscillatory power required for the beating of insect wings35
and is also a prominent process in heart muscle,8,31,36 where it
is thought to play an important role in modulating pump
function and power output.9,37 In this respect, it has been
observed that some mutations of sarcomeric proteins in insect
muscles38 and mouse myocardium36 alter the stretch activa-
tion response and power output. From such studies, it appears
that both the rate of force development (kdf) and the amplitude
of the additional force recruited by stretch activation (P3) are
associated with modulation of power output, an important
determinant of systolic function.
The present study shows that the stretch activation re-
sponse in myocardium is dramatically altered by ablation of
cMyBP-C. When isometrically contracting myocardium is
suddenly stretched, there is a corresponding increase in force
caused by strain of attached cross-bridges. In turn, strain
results in detachment of some cross-bridges and a decrease in
force, a process that is quickly reversed by attachment of new
cross-bridges and redevelopment of force to greater than
prestretch isometric levels. cMyBP-C/ myocardium exhib-
its increases in the apparent rate constant and amplitude of the
phase 2 force decay compared with WT. The N terminus of
cMyBP-C binds to myosin S2 and/or actin and thus might
modulate the interaction between myosin and actin,3,39–41 so
that removal of cMyBP-C could alter rates of cross-bridge
attachment or detachment or both. Genetic deletion or acute
biochemical extraction of cMyBP-C/ from myocardium
increases shortening velocity,19,33 presumably because of
increased rates of cross-bridge detachment. Accelerated de-
tachment would explain the observed increase in krel and the
greater decline in force immediately following stretch of
cMyBP-C/ myocardium. It is also possible that accelerated
transitions to force generating states (kdf) in cMyBP-C/
myocardium contribute to increased cross-bridge detachment
as a consequence of an increased flux of cross-bridges into
and through the force-producing steps preceding detachment.
Changes in the amplitude of P2 have also been interpreted
as indicating reversal of force-producing steps in response to
stretch,42 such that more negative values of P2 represent
greater reversal of steps such as the phosphate release step.43
A possible adaptive advantage of such reversal is improved
efficiency in myocardium subjected to stretch, because cross-
bridges could conceivably detach from actin and quickly
reattach without consuming ATP.42
Delayed force redevelopment (phase 3) in the response to
stretch, ie, stretch activation, is thought to be mediated by
recruitment of additional cross-bridges to force generating
states.10,30,31 Here, there was no difference in amplitude of P3

between WT and cMyBP-C/ myocardium, suggesting that
the number of cross-bridges recruited by stretch was similar
in the 2 cases; however, the rate constant of force redevelop-
ment (kdf) was dramatically accelerated in cMyBP-C/ myo-
cardium. Because stretch activation (phase 3) in cardiac
muscle involves both cooperative and direct stretch-induced
recruitment of cross-bridges,10,31 the acceleration of kdf in
cMyBP-C/ myocardium suggests that the rates of force-
generating transitions are accelerated and that the contribu-
tions resulting from cooperative recruitment of cross-bridges
(which tend to slow force generation44) are reduced in the
absence of cMyBP-C. Thus, the increased power output
reported in cMyBP-C/ myocytes32 can be explained as a
consequence of faster cross-bridge cycling kinetics.
From the stoichiometric ratio of cMyBP-C molecules to
myosin heads,45 cMyBP-C binds to only a small fraction of
myosin heads in WT hearts, and, thus, ablation would directly
affect relatively few myosin heads. If cMyBP-C behaves as a
tether on myosin, ablation may remove a spatial constraint on
these heads3,4,19,34,46 and thereby increase the probability of
binding to actin. Increased binding of small numbers of
cross-bridges might not significantly increase overall force
(there is no increase in maximum isometric force in cMyBP-
C/ myocardium) but could still accelerate the rate of force
development and cross-bridge cycling kinetics attributable to
the sensitivity of the cardiac thin filament to the activating
effects of even small numbers of attached cross-bridges
(reviewed by Moss et al47).
Ablation of cMyBP-C accelerates cross-bridge kinetics
(Table and Figure 4) but, seemingly paradoxically, results in
diminished stroke volume and cardiac hypertrophy.4 How-
ever, the apparent acceleration of rate constants of cross-
bridge detachment and attachment in cMyBP-C/ myocar-
dium can account for depressed pump function. In the context
of cardiac contraction in which stronger regions of myocar-
dium stretch weaker parts to induce delayed stretch activa-
tion,9,10 accelerated turnover kinetics would predict a shorter
delay in stretch activation, an earlier peak for the cardiac
twitch, and earlier completion of the ejection phase. Such a
phenomenon might be difficult to appreciate from our record-
ings because [Ca2] is maintained constant and the force
transient is slow to decay. In contrast, in living muscle the
transient increase in intracellular Ca2 is over quickly, so that
the faster stretch activation response in cMyBP-C/ myocar-
dium would result in an earlier early onset of relaxation of
force. In effect, the accelerated kinetics of stretch activation
are no longer tuned to the twitch kinetics required for a
normal ejection period.
Taken together, our results support the idea that cMyBP-C
normally constrains the interaction of myosin heads with
actin and suggest that the acceleration of cross-bridge cycling
kinetics attributable to ablation of cMyBP-C contributes to
reduced ejection by abbreviating the period of ejection.
Earlier work5 has shown that the in vivo, functional effects of
cMyBP-C ablation are very similar to those caused by a
C-terminal truncation of cMyBP-C,5 a common form of
cMyBP-C mutations leading to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
in humans. Thus, results from this study may have applica-
bility to the mechanism of contractile dysfunction in
cMyBP-C cardiomyopathies, which are among the most
common inherited myocardial diseases.1–3
