Abstract In the course of an effort to identify the regulators
for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg)-
dependent perilipin gene expression, we found that tribbles
homolog 3 (TRB3), containing a single kinase domain with-
out enzymatic activity, downregulates PPARg transcriptional
activities by protein-protein interaction. We examined the
role that TRB3 plays in adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1
cells. TRB3 gene and protein expression was increased
during adipocyte differentiation concomitantly with an in-
crease in the mRNA levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding
protein homologous protein. The physical interaction
between TRB3 and PPARg was also verified in 3T3-L1
adipocytes. Forced TRB3 expression in 3T3-L1 cells de-
creased the mRNA levels of PPARg-target genes and
intracellular triglyceride levels, whereas knockdown of
TRB3 expression by RNA interference increased them.
TRB3 also inhibits PPARg-dependent adipocyte differenti-
ation in lentivirus-mediated PPARg-expressing 3T3-L1
cells. These results provide evidence that TRB3 acts as
a potent negative regulator of PPARg, a master regulator
of adipocyte differentiation, and tightly controls adipogen-
esis.—Takahashi, Y., N. Ohoka, H. Hayashi, and R. Sato.

Obesity is a major risk factor in the development of
type II diabetes. In recent years, adipocytes have been
shown to play an important role in the generation of the
secreted hormones and cytokines involved in metabolic
activities (1). Abnormally and/or excessively differentiated
adipocytes may help induce the metabolic syndrome by
producing insulin-resistant hormones and cytokines (e.g.,
tumor necrosis factor-a) (2, 3). The differentiation of
preadipocytes into adipocytes is regulated by an elaborate
network of transcription factors that control the expres-
sion of hundreds of genes responsible for establishing the
mature adipocyte phenotype. It is now well accepted that
both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg)
and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) func-
tion as critical regulators of adipogenesis in the complex
transcriptional cascade (4, 5). PPARg, amaster regulator of
adipogenesis, induces the expression of adipocyte-specific
genes through the binding of PPARg-retinoid X receptor-a
(RXRa) heterodimers to a PPAR-response element (PPRE)
(6, 7), resulting in the promotion of intracellular fat stor-
age. PPARg and RXRa belong to the nuclear receptor
superfamily and share a high degree of homology in the N
terminus with a ligand-independent transcriptional activa-
tion function (AF)-1 domain and in the C terminus with a
ligand-dependent transcriptional AF-2 domain (8). A num-
ber of investigations have demonstrated that C/EBPb
along with C/EBPy directly induces the expression of
PPARg2, an isoform of PPARg expressed exclusively in
adipocytes (9). In turn, PPARg activates the transcription
of the C/EBPa gene (9).
Another signaling pathway that stimulates adipogenesis
is mediated by sterol-regulatory element binding protein-
1c (SREBP-1c) (10). SREBP-1c is a basic helix-loop-helix
protein abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and liver
(11), and its gene expression is induced by insulin (12,
13). SREBP-1c has been shown to increase fatty acid and
triglyceride synthesis, and this has been attributed in part
to the influence on PPARg activity exerted by inducing
its gene expression and producing as yet unidentified
endogenous ligands (14, 15).

tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3), identified as a mammalian
homolog of Drosophilatribbles, functions as a negative reg-
ulator of the serine-threonine kinase Akt in the liver and
skeletal muscle (16, 17). In the liver, TRB3 is induced
under stressful conditions, such as fasting, endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, and nutrient starvation (18, 19). In
db/db mice, a rodent model of type II diabetes, increased
hepatic expression of TRB3 results in hyperglycemia and
insulin resistance (16). On the other hand, transgenic
mice that overexpress TRB3 in adipose tissue are resistant
to diet-induced obesity and display enhanced insulin sen-
sitivity (20). Thus, the functions of TRB3 are various and
different in distinct tissues.
In this study, we show that TRB3 reduces PPARg-
dependent perilipin gene expression. We hypothesized
that TRB3 could be involved in the regulation of adipo-
genesis that is governed predominantly by PPARg and in-
vestigated TRB3 functions during adipocyte differentiation.
TRB3 gene expression is augmented along with the differ-
entiation of 3T3-L1 cultured cells, a commonly usedmodel
of adipocyte differentiation. TRB3 overexpression or knock-
down in 3T3-L1 cells affects adipocyte differentiation and
triglyceride accumulation in the cells. These results in-
dicate that TRB3 plays a critical role in adipogenesis and
could be a novel therapeutic target for preventing the ab-
normal adipocity that is involved in metabolic disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethazone, piogli-
tazone, anti-perilipin antibody, and anti-human TRB3 antibody
were obtained as described previously (18, 21). Troglitazone was
kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Evans (Salk Institute). Taq-Man
probes for mouse TRB3, aP2, perilipin, adiponectin, and SREBP-
1 were from Applied Biosystems. Anti-Flag and anti-Myc mono-
clonal antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-mouse TRB3 antibodies
were from Calbiochem and Santa Cruz. Anti-actin and anti-green
fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies were from Chemicon and
Abcam, respectively. Anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt (serine-473,
threonine-308) were from Cell Signaling. The protease inhibitor
cocktail was from Sigma.
Cell culture
HEK293 and 293-T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10%
FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. 3T3-L1
fibroblasts (obtained from the Health Science Research
Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan) were cultured and differentiated
into adipocytes as described previously (21). Plat-E cells (22)
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 10 mg/ml blasticidin, and
1 mg/ml puromycin. 3T3-L1/Tet-Off/TRB3 stable cells were
cultured in DMEM with 10% Tet System-approved FBS (Clon-
tech), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 600 mg/ml
G418, 400 mg/ml hygromycin, and 1 mg/ml doxycycline.
Plasmid constructs
Expression retroviral plasmids for TRB3 and TRB3DAkt (lack-
ing amino acids 239–266) were constructed by inserting fragments
coding for human TRB3 into pMXs-IRES-GFP (23). To generate an
expression plasmid for mouse TRB3, a PCR fragment encoding
mouse TRB3 obtained by RT-PCR using total white adipose tissue
RNA from a BALB/c mouse was inserted into p3xFLAG-CMV
(Sigma). An expression plasmid for Flag-tagged TRB3 was con-
structed by inserting a fragment coding for Flag-taggedmouseTRB3
into pBI-EGFP (Clontech). An expression lentiviral plasmid for
Flag-tagged TRB3 and PPARg was constructed by inserting a
fragment coding for Flag-tagged TRB3 and PPARg, respectively,
into CSII-EF-MCS-IRES2-Venus (RIKEN). Expression lentiviral plas-
mids for short hairpinRNA(shRNA)ofmouseTRB3or control were
constructed by recombining CS-RfA-EG (RIKEN) with pENTR4-H1
(RIKEN) inserted by oligonucleotide DNA for shRNA expression.
The target sequences were as follows: TRB3, 5¶-CGAGTGAGAG-
ATGAGCCTG-3¶; control (Scramble II Duplex from Dharmacon),
5¶-GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG-3¶. The target for TRB3 has been
used previously and confirmed to be effective (16, 20). Expression
and reporter plasmids [pCMX-GAL4-PPARg AF2 and p(PPRE)3-tk-
Luc] were kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Evans (Salk Institute). An
expression plasmid (pSVSPORT-PPARg) was kindly provided by
Dr. M. Imagawa (Nagoya City University). Expression plasmids for
the TRB3 mutants (pcDNA3.1-Flag-TRB3, pCMV5-Myc-TRB3, and
pCMV5-Flag-TRB3) were constructed as described previously (18).
Other expression plasmids (pCMV5-PPARg, pCMV5-RXRa,
pCMV5-PPARg DN, replacing lysine-497 and glutamate-499 with
alanine, pCMV5-PPARgDA/B lacking amino acids 1–137, pCMV5-
PPARgDE/F lacking amino acids 311–505, pCMV5-GAL4-PPARg,
and pCMV5-GAL4-RXRa) were generated using PCR products.
All constructs were verified by sequencing.
Retrovirus infection
Plat-E cells were transfected with retroviral plasmids by the
Chen-Okayama method (24), and after 48 h of transfection, the
culture medium containing retroviruses was collected and fil-
tered. 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the medium supplemented
with 10 mg/ml polybrene by a centrifugation method (2,500 rpm,
60 min). After 8 h of infection, the cells were refed with a fresh
culture medium (DMEM with 10% calf serum, 100 U/ml pen-
icillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin).
Lentivirus infection
293-T cells were transfectedwith an expression lentiviral plasmid
together with a packaging (pCAG-HIVgp) and a VSV-G-/Rev-
expressing (pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev) plasmid by the Chen-Okayama
method (24). After 60 h of transfection, the medium containing
lentiviruses was collected and filtered. 3T3-L1 cells were infected
with the medium supplemented with 10 mg/ml polybrene by a
centrifugation method (2,500 rpm, 90 min). The cells were then
refed with a fresh culture medium (DMEM with 10% calf serum,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin).
Stable cell lines
3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with the tetracycline-
controlled transactivator-expressing plasmid (pTet-Off; Clon-
tech) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) were
selected in the presence of 600 mg/ml G418 for 14 days. An
individual clone was transfected with the pTRE-luc reporter
plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, and after 48 h of
transfection, luciferase activities were measured and 3T3-L1/
Tet-Off stable cells were established. 3T3-L1/Tet-Off cells were
transfected with either the mock (pBI-EGFP) or the Flag-tagged
(pBI-EGFP-TRB3) mouse TRB3-expressing plasmid containing
the TRE promoter together with a pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector
(Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Cells were se-
lected in the presence of 400 mg/ml hygromycin for 7 days, Flag-

TRB3 stable cells were established.
Small interfering RNA experiments
The small interfering RNAs for mouse TRB3 (5¶-CGAGUGA-
GAGAUGAGCCUG-3¶, the sequence used in lentiviral experi-
ments) and control (5¶-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG-3¶, the
sequence of Scramble II Duplex by Dharmacon) were transfected
into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using Lipofectamine RNA interfer-
ence MAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Three days after transfection, the 3T3-L1 cells were
subjected to adipocyte differentiation.
Northern blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR
3T3-L1 cells differentiated into adipocytes were harvested, and
total RNA was extracted using an RNA preparation kit (ISOGEN;
NipponGeneCorp.).Northern blottingwas performedas described
previously (21). TRB3 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-
radiolabeled hybridization probes were generated using the
individual cDNA fragments. Reverse transcription was performed
using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied
Biosystems). Fluorescent real-time PCR was performed on an ABI
PRISM 7000 system using Taq-Man Gene Expression Assays
(Applied Biosystems) or SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) with the primers as follows: C/EBPa, 5¶-GCGCAAGAG-
CCGAGATAAAG-3¶ (sense), 5¶-CGGTCATTGTCACTGGTCAACT-

CTCCCGCACACAACATACTG-3¶ (sense), 5¶-CTTCGGCAACCACC-
TAAAAG-3¶ (antisense). S17 rRNA protein transcript was used as an
internal control to normalize the mRNA levels of each gene.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
Total cellular proteins were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, pH 8.0, and a protease inhibitor cocktail). Immuno-
precipitation and Western blotting were performed as described
previously (25, 26). The signals on the membrane were quan-
tified with an LAS1000 lumino image analyzer (FujiFilm).
Reporter assays
3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with luciferase reporter
and expression plasmids by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, and
after 24 h of transfection, they were refed with a fresh medium
containing 10 mM troglitazone. Luciferase assays were carried out
as described previously (26, 27).
Purification of recombinant proteins and in vitro
binding assay
Glutathione S-transferase-tagged Flag-TRB3 and Myc-PPARg
were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and affinity-purified with
glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBioscience). Recombinant
Flag-TRB3 and Myc-PPARg proteins were cleaved from the glu-
tathione S-transferase fusion proteins with PreScission Protease
(GE Healthcare). The purity and concentration of the recombi-
nant protein were estimated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.
In an in vitro binding assay, protein-protein complexes were
mixed in RIPA buffer containing 10 mg/ml BSA and subjected to
immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies.
Oil Red O staining
When differentiated into adipocytes, 3T3-L1 cells were
cultured with differentiation medium containing 10 mM piogli-
tazone for the first 2 days and then refed with an adipocyte
growing medium. The cells were refed with a fresh medium every
2 days and, after harvest, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS
and stained with Oil Red O solution [0.5%Oil Red O-2-propanol:
milliQ, 3:2 (v/v)] for 1 h at room temperature.
Lipid analysis
3T3-L1 cells were washed with PBS, and lipids were extracted
by hexane-2-propanol (3:2, v/v). The amounts of intracellular
triglyceride were determined by the Triglyceride E-test from
Wako and normalized to the amounts of total cellular protein
determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to each
manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
The results obtained in this study are presented as means6 SD

RESULTS
TRB3 suppresses PPARg transcriptional activities
In our previous report, we demonstrated that the genetic
expression of perilipin, a lipid droplet surface protein in
adipocytes, is controlled by PPARg (21). The mouse
perilipin gene promoter (?2.0 kb) contains a functional
PPRE. We sought modulators for PPARg-dependent perili-
pin gene expression among a number of transcription
factors and regulatory proteins and found that TRB3 can
suppress perilipin promoter activity. We performed lucifer-
ase assays using reporter genes containing the mouse
perilipin promoter (?2.0 kb, pPlin-2.0) or three tandem
repeats of the consensus PPRE [p(PPRE)3-tk]. The pro-
moter activities were stimulated when PPARg and RXRa
were expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but suppressed
when TRB3 was coexpressed in the presence or absence
of troglitazone, a potent agonist of PPARg (Fig. 1A).
We next used a heterologous Gal-4 system, with ex-
pression plasmids encoding a full-length PPARg or an AF-2
ligand binding domain of PPARg coupled to the DNA
binding domain of yeast Gal-4, to determine the direct
effect of TRB3 on PPARg transcriptional activities. In the
presence of troglitazone, both promoter activities were
increased (Fig. 1B, left, middle). TRB3 suppressed the
transcriptional activities of full-length PPARg more po-
tently than those of the AF-2 domain (Fig. 1B, left, middle).
On the other hand, the transcriptional activities of full-
length RXRa were not affected by TRB3 (Fig. 1B, right).
Finally, we examined the effect of TRB3 mutants
(Fig. 2C, right) on PPARg transcriptional activities using
pPlin-2.0. TRB3DN (amino acids 128–358) as well as wild-
type TRB3 suppressed PPARg transcriptional activities in
the presence or absence of troglitazone, whereas neither
TRB3DC (amino acids 1–282) nor TRB3DAkt lacking
the Akt binding domain (amino acids 239–265) had any
effect on PPARg transcriptional activities (Fig. 1C). We
confirmed that PPARg protein levels were not affected
by TRB3 (see supplementary Fig. I).
These results clearly indicate that TRB3 suppresses
PPARg transcriptional activities and that the C-terminal
half of TRB3 is required to exert its inhibitory effects.

TRB3 interacts with PPARg
The results described above prompted us to test the
hypothesis that TRB3 suppresses PPARg transcriptional
activities as a result of a protein-protein interaction. We
first analyzed the interaction by a coimmunoprecipitation
method using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with
expression plasmids for these proteins. When cells ex-
pressed both Myc-TRB3 and Flag-PPARg, Myc-TRB3 was
recovered in the immunoprecipitates with an anti-Flag
antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 3), indicating that TRB3 associates
with PPARg. On the other hand, TRB3 did not interact
with RXRa, a heterodimer partner of PPARg (Fig. 2A,
lane 4). To investigate whether TRB3 interacts with
PPARg directly, we next performed an in vitro binding
Fig. 1. Effects of tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) on the transcription activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor g (PPARg). A: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with expression plasmids for PPARg, retinoid X
receptor-a (RXRa), or TRB3 and a reporter plasmid with the perilipin promoter (left) or the PPAR-response
element (PPRE)3-tk promoter (right) together with pCMV-b-gal. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were refed
with a medium containing 10 mM troglitazone and incubated for 24 h. Luciferase activities were normalized to
b-galactosidase activities and considered as 1 in the absence of PPARg, RXRa, TRB3, and troglitazone. B: 3T3-
L1 preadipocytes were transfected with expression plasmids for GAL4-PPARg-FL (full length; left), GAL4-
PPARg-AF2 (activation function-2;middle), orGAL4-RXRa (right) together with expressionplasmids forTRB3
and pCMV-b-gal. The cells were then processed as described for A. C: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected
with expressionplasmids for PPARg, RXRa, or variousTRB3mutants (see Fig. 2C, right) and a reporter plasmid
with the perilipin promoter together with pCMV-b-gal. The cells were then processed as described for A. WT,

assay using recombinant purified proteins, and direct
interaction was observed (Fig. 2B, lane 2).
To identify the domain of PPARg required for the in-
teraction with TRB3, we generated various deletion con-
structs of PPARg. We generated a dominant negative
form of PPARg containing substitutions of lysine-497 and
glutamate-499 with alanine, PPARgDA/B (amino acids
138–505) lacking the A/B region that contains the con-
stitutive transcriptional activation domain, AF1, and
PPARgDE/F (amino acids 1–310) lacking the E/F region
with the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation do-
main, AF2 (Fig. 2C, right). Although all PPARg mutants
interacted with full-length TRB3, PPARgDA/B had only a
weak interaction with TRB3 (Fig. 2C, left).
Next, we used various deletion constructs of TRB3, as
shown in Fig. 2D, right, to identify the domain required

immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibodies. Both lysates and precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
with anti-Myc and anti-Flag antibodies. B: Recombinant Flag-TRB3 (rFlag-TRB3; 0.1 mg) and Myc-PPARg (rMyc-PPARg; 0.1 mg) were
subjected to in vitro binding assay, as described in Materials and Methods. The protein-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated
with anti-Flag antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-PPARg antibodies. The level of each protein was assessed by immunoblotting with
a 2% input of anti-Flag and anti-PPARg antibodies. C, D: HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated constructs (PPARg mutants and
TRB3 mutants) were harvested after 48 h of transfection, and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag

for the interaction with PPARg. Although TRB3DN
(amino acids 128–358) interacted with PPARg, deletion
of either the Akt binding domain (amino acids 239–265)
or the C-terminal 76 amino acid residues (DAkt and DC),
which cannot suppress the transcriptional activities of
PPARg (Fig. 1C), abolished the interaction (Fig. 2D, left),

TRB3 mRNA levels increase during adipocyte
differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells
To verify that TRB3 is involved in the adipocyte
differentiation accompanying PPARg, we first examined
daily changes in the levels of TRB3 mRNA and protein
during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Real-time RT-
PCR (Fig. 3A, left) as well as Northern blot analysis (see
supplementary Fig. IIA) revealed that TRB3 mRNA levels
decreased during the first 2 days after differentiation and
then increased drastically. In terms of other tribbles family
members, TRB1 was not detectable (data not shown), but
TRB2 mRNA levels decreased during differentiation (see
supplementary Fig. IIA). During the initial 48 h, TRB3
mRNA levels declined for the first 24 h, then gradually
returned to the 0 h level at 24 h, and again declined until
48 h (see supplementary Fig. IIB). After the downregula-
tion in early stage, TRB3 mRNA levels were induced for
the next several days until day 14 (Fig. 3D). On the other
hand, the mRNA levels of C/EBPb and C/EBPy, both of
which are key regulators in the early stage of adipocyte

sion during adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells.
Total RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells on the in-
dicated days after treatment with a differentiation
medium (see Materials and Methods). A: Relative
mRNA levels of TRB3, CCAAT/enhancer binding pro-
tein (C/EBP)b, C/EBPy, PPARg, and aP2 were
determined by real-time RT-PCR after being normal-
ized to S17 mRNA. The data represent means6 SD. B:
3T3-L1 cells were harvested on the indicated days
during adipocyte differentiation, and whole cell lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
with anti-TRB3, anti-PPARg, and anti-actin antibodies.
C: Pioglitazone was added to the medium on day 2.
3T3-L1 cells were harvested on day 3, and the relative
mRNA levels of aP2 and TRB3 were determined by
real-time RT-PCR after being normalized to S17
mRNA. Relative mRNA levels of aP2 and TRB3 in
the absence of pioglitazone are considered as 1. The
data represent means6 SD. D: Total RNA obtained on
the indicated days was subjected to electrophoresis
and blot hybridization with the indicated 32P-labeled
probes. E: Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-
PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-TRB3, anti-
actin, and anti-C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
antibodies. F: 3T3-L1 cells were infected with either an
empty (mock) or human TRB3 expressing lentiviral

differentiation, decreased gradually after being transiently
induced (day 2 and day 4, respectively), and their ex-
pression patterns were quite different from that of TRB3
(Fig. 3A). The mRNA levels of PPARg and aP2, a PPARg
target gene (28), increased gradually and reached a peak
on day 8 (Fig. 3A; see supplementary Fig. IIA). We further
confirmed TRB3 protein expression during differentia-
tion with Western blotting. A commercial antibody against
mouse TRB3 recognized endogenous TRB3 protein on
day 10 (Fig. 3B). Although mRNA levels of TRB3 were
relatively high on day 0, its protein levels were not cor-
respondingly high. The reason is still unclear, but it can be
speculated that TRB3 expression is regulated either trans-
lationally or posttranslationally.
Because TRB3 gene expression is induced during differ-
entiation and it has been reported that the TRB3 pro-
moter contains a PPRE and is activated by PPARa in the
liver (29), we next examined whether TRB3 gene ex-
pression in adipocytes is augmented by PPARg, a member
of the PPAR family expressed exclusively in adipocytes.
Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with pioglitazone, a potent ag-
onist of PPARg, unexpectedly failed to stimulate TRB3 gene
expression during adipocyte differentiation, unlike aP2
gene expression, which was stimulated (Fig. 3C). These
results indicate that the expression of TRB3 is accelerated
during adipocyte differentiation in a PPARg-independent
manner. As our previous study had shown that TRB3
expression is induced during ER stress in a CHOP-
dependent manner, CHOPmRNA and protein expression
during adipocyte differentiation was examined. As shown
in Fig. 3D, E, the induction pattern of CHOP mRNA and
protein closely resembles that of TRB3.
Because endogenous TRB3 and PPARg proteins coexist
at the late stages of differentiation, as shown in Fig. 3B, we
then performed immunoprecipitation to verify whether
TRB3 interacts physically with endogenous PPARg in 3T3-
L1 adipocytes. First, we performed immunoprecipitation
of the total lysates of 3T3-L1 cells expressing the lentivirus-
mediated Flag-TRB3. When cells were immunoprecipi-
tated with anti-Flag antibody, endogenous PPARg was
discovered in the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3F). More-
over, PPARg was coimmunoprecipitatable with TRB3
using anti-TRB3 antibodies from the lysates of 3T3-L1
cells after 10 days of differentiation (Fig. 3G), indicating
that endogenous TRB3 and PPARg interacted physically in
3T3-L1 adipocytes.
These findings suggest that bothTRB3 andPPARg coexist
in the differentiating 3T3-L1 cells and thus would have the
opportunity to communicate with each other, thereby af-
fecting PPARg target gene expression during adipogenesis.
TRB3 overexpression prevents adipocyte differentiation
in 3T3-L1 cells
To further investigate the function of TRB3 in adipocyte
differentiation, we next overexpressed TRB3 in 3T3-L1
preadipocytes by retroviral infection. At 7 days after in-
fection, the cells were subjected to differentiation into
adipocytes, and TRB3 protein expression on day 6 was
confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). The protein
expression of perilipin was reduced by TRB3 overexpres-
sion, consistent with the results in Fig. 1 (Fig. 4A). We as-
sessed the degree of adipocyte differentiation in the cells
on day 8 by Oil Red O staining and found a reduced
interacellular lipid accumulation in the TRB3-expressing
cells compared with the controls (Fig. 4B). This was fur-
ther confirmed by direct determination of the intracellu-
lar triglyceride content on days 6 and 9 (Fig. 4C). On the
other hand, TRB3DAkt, which did not interact with PPARg
and failed to suppress perilipin promoter activities
(Figs. 1C, 2D), did not have any effect on either perilipin
protein expression or intracellular lipid accumulation
(Fig. 4A, B). These results clearly indicate that TRB3 over-
expression delays or prevents adipocyte differentiation.
When the expression of several genes induced during
adipocyte differentiation was compared in these two cells,
we found that the mRNA levels of aP2, perilipin,
adiponectin, and C/EBPa, which are all PPARg target
genes (9, 21, 28, 30), were reduced in the TRB3-expressing
cells (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, mRNA expression of
SREBP-1, which is thought to act at an early stage of
differentiation before PPARg activation (14), was hardly
affected by TRB3 overexpression throughout the course of
differentiation (Fig. 4D). PPARg gene expression was
reduced in the TRB3-expressing cells only on days 2 and 4,
and the decrease was marginal compared with the large
decline in PPARg target genes (Fig. 4D). Gene expression
of C/EBPb and C/EBPy, which are required for an early
stage of adipogenesis and are not under the control of
PPARg, was scarcely affected by the overexpressed TRB3
(Fig. 4D). These findings indicate that TRB3 functions as a
negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation as a result
of the suppression of PPARg target gene expression.
To more completely verify TRB3 function in adipocyte
differentiation, we next established a stable cell line that
can be made to induce TRB3 expression for a shorter pe-
riod by the use of the Tet-Off system. Removing doxy-
cycline from the medium on day 25 enabled the cells to
express exogenous Flag-TRB3 on day 0 (see supplemen-
tary Fig. IIIA). When doxycycline was added to the
medium, TRB3 protein expression was suppressed com-
pletely. When both the TRB3-infected and mock-infected
cells were differentiated in the absence of doxycycline,
TRB3 overexpression reduced the intracellular lipid
accumulation (see supplementary Fig. IIIB, C). In
addition, forced TRB3 expression also suppressed the
gene expression of aP2, perilipin, and adiponectin, but
not SREBP-1 (see supplementary Fig. IIID). These find-
ings are completely consistent with those observed in cells
infected with the retroviral TRB3 expression vector.
Therefore, we conclude that the TRB3 highly expressed
in 3T3-L1 cells delays or inhibits adipocyte differentiation.

nous TRB3 in adipocyte differentiation by RNA interfer-
ence. First, we modified 3T3-L1 cells through lentiviral

day 0, the mRNA level of TRB3 was reduced by .60% in
the cells infected with a lentiviral vector for TRB3-specific

the protein levels was also confirmed by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 5A, right). These cells were differentiated
into adipocytes, and on day 10, the greater amount of
intracellular lipid accumulation in the TRB3 knockdown
cells was confirmed by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 5B) or by
direct measurement of the intracellular triglyceride con-
tent (Fig. 5C). On day 6, when TRB3 shRNA was still
effective and TRB3 gene expression was suppressed sig-
nificantly in the presence or absence of a potent PPARg
agonist, pioglitazone (Fig. 5D), the expression of PPARg
target genes was stimulated in the TRB3 knockdown cells
(Fig. 5D). Moreover, when TRB3 gene expression in 3T3-
L1 cells was knocked down by double-stranded TRB3-
specific RNA oligonucleotides, similar results were
obtained (see supplementary Fig. IVA–C). These data
clearly show that endogenous TRB3 acts as a negative
regulator of adipocyte differentiation through the sup-
pression of PPARg target gene expression.

TRB3 blocks PPARg-mediated adipocyte differentiation
in 3T3-L1 cells
Because TRB3 has been reported to inhibit Akt activ-
ity (16, 17), it is possible that the inhibitory effect of
TRB3 on adipocyte differentiation might be mediated by
Akt inactivation. To verify this issue, we assessed insulin-
stimulated Akt activity in TRB3-overexpressing 3T3-L1
cells. TRB3 scarcely affected the phosphorylation of Akt
at serine-473 but decreased the phosphorylation of Akt
at threonine-308 (Fig. 6A). This suggests that the inhib-
itory effect on adipocyte differentiation is mediated, at
least partially, by Akt inactivation.
Next, we generated PPARg-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells
by lentiviral infection to examine whether TRB3 could
suppress PPARg-dependent adipocyte differentiation.
PPARg-expressing 3T3-L1 cells differentiated into adipo-
cytes without hormonal stimulation, as is the case with
PPARg-expressing NIH-3T3 cells (5) (Fig. 6B). When
coinfected with TRB3, triglyceride accumulation was
reduced in both the absence and presence of troglitazone
(Fig. 6B) and mRNA levels of aP2, perilipin, and
adiponectin were all decreased (Fig. 6C), whereas the
expression of PPARg was not affected (Fig. 6C, D). These
results clearly demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of
TRB3 on adipogenesis is certainly mediated by PPARg
inactivation, independent of the upstream signaling
pathway, including Akt.
DISCUSSION
The current study clearly demonstrates that TRB3
inhibits adipocyte differentiation by impairing PPARg
transcriptional activity, indicating that TRB3 functions as
a novel antiadipogenic factor. It is noteworthy that
TRB3 governs adipogenesis by suppressing the activity of
PPARg, a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation,
through protein-protein interaction. Based on the results
obtained using the heterologous Gal-4 system, the inter-
action directly suppressed PPARg transcriptional activity,
not its DNA binding activity. It is likely that the recruit-
ment of certain coactivators required for the transactiva-
tion of PPARg during adipogenesis is blocked by the TRB3
association. Considering that the expression of TRB3 is
induced during differentiation (Fig. 3) and has an inhib-
itory effect on adipogenesis in PPARg-dependent differ-
entiated 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 6), it is suggested that TRB3 is
active in the abnormally and excessively differentiated adi-
pocytes that are found in obesity and metabolic syndrome.
There are many antiadipogenic factors reported, such as
GATA factors, KLF2, KLF7, CHOP, Pref-1, and Wnt10b
(31, 32). The expression of all of these factors decreases at
an early stage of differentiation. Because mRNA levels of
TRB3 are decreased, as are those of other antiadipogenic
factors (Fig. 3A, D; see supplementary Fig. IIB), the
decline in TRB3 at an early stage is expected to contribute
to an acceleration of differentiation. Also, it makes sense
that TRB3 induced at the later stage of differentiation
works as a brake on adipogenesis by inhibiting PPARg for
the purpose of preventing excessive progression. Overall,
TRB3 would function as a negative regulator of adipogen-
esis throughout differentiation; however, its physiological
significance is likely to be different between the early and
the later stages of differentiation.
As TRB3 was originally discovered as an inhibitory factor
for Akt in the insulin signaling pathway, one can speculate
that TRB3 represses the adipocyte differentiation initiated
by insulin activity. We show here that TRB3 mRNA levels
at the beginning of differentiation are relatively high
(Fig. 3A) and confirm that Akt activity at threonine-308
was partially impaired in TRB3-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells
(Fig. 6A). Recently, on the other hand, it was reported that
TRB3 blocks C/EBPb transcriptional activities (33). Be-
cause the expression of TRB3 is inversely correlated with
that of C/EBPb at the early stage of differentiation, the
decline in TRB3 could be favorable to the activation of C/
EBPb and the subsequent progression of adipogenesis. In
this report, TRB3 did not affect Akt activity during
differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells, but it is likely that TRB3 is
an antiadipogenic factor at the time of the onset of adi-
pogenesis. Indeed, whenTRB3was overexpressed in 3T3-L1
cells by retroviral infection, the gene expression of C/EBPa
was suppressed on days 0 and 2, before the induction of
PPARg gene expression (Fig. 4). This suggests that TRB3
blocks the signaling pathway upstream of PPARg and de-
presses C/EBPa gene expression, thereafter diminishing
the gene expression of PPARg, a C/EBPa target gene, on
days 2 and 4. However, overexpression of TRB3 did not lead
to significant changes in the gene expression of SREBP-1
(Fig. 4), suggesting that Akt activity was not so impaired
by TRB3 during differentiation. Considering that TRB3
blocks PPARg-dependent adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 6),
it is suggested that TRB3 functions not only at the early
stage of differentiation by inhibiting C/EBPb but also at the
later stage of differentiation by inhibiting PPARg tran-
scriptional activities; this is also supported by the fact that
TRB3 is induced right after the activation of PPARg (Fig. 3).
It has also been reported that TRB3 promotes acetyl-
coenzyme A carboxylase 1 ubiquitination through an
association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, COP1, and
stimulates its degradation, reducing triglyceride synthesis
in adipocytes (20). Transgenic mice expressing TRB3 in
adipose tissue are lean and protected from diet-induced
obesity. Because TRB3 expression in these mice is under
the control of the aP2 gene promoter, thereby being fully
stimulated in late adipogenesis, the observed phenotype
does not allow us to evaluate TRB3 function during
adipocyte differentiation, but it does suggest that TRB3
works as an antiadipogenic factor in the later stages of
differentiation after PPARg is activated.
As far as PPARg is concerned, there were no changes in
the exogenous PPARg protein level by the enforced
expression of TRB3 (Fig. 6D; see supplementary Fig. I),
suggesting that their interaction results in a suppression of
PPARg transcriptional activity, not in increased degrada-
tion. Therefore, it is evident that TRB3 is a multifunctional
protein that represses adipocyte differentiation and
diminishes triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes.

We previously showed that ER stress induces TRB3
gene expression (18). Obesity causes ER stress, and this
impairs insulin signaling by excessive serine phosphoryla-
tion of insulin receptor substrate-1 (34). On the other
hand, a reduction of ER stress by chemical chaperones
restores insulin sensitivity in the liver, skeletal muscle, and
adipose tissue of diabetic ob/ob mice (35). Thus, TRB3
induced by ER stress might prevent adipocytes from en-
hancing further excessive differentiation and accumulat-
ing more triglyceride. Indeed, transgenic mice expressing
TRB3 in adipose tissue are resistant to diet-induced obesity
and have improved insulin sensitivity (20). However, in the
liver, overexpression of TRB3 results in hyperglycemia
and glucose intolerance, and knockdown of TRB3 im-
proves glucose tolerance, indicating that TRB3 helps
trigger type II diabetes (16). Therefore, it can be spec-
ulated that TRB3 functions differently in distinct tissues.
Recently, TRB3-deficient mice were generated and dis-
played no evident abnormalities (36). This implies that
TRB3 does not have a major role in energy homeostasis, at
least under normal nutrient conditions. Although the
reason why TRB3-deficient mice display normal energy
homeostasis is inexplicable at present, it is speculated that
other genes compensate for the lack of TRB3, or that
TRB3 is only functional when induced by various specific
stresses. The role of TRB3 may become clear when TRB3-
deficient mice are fed a high-fat diet or crossed with cer-
tain disease models, such as ob/ob mice.
We show here that TRB3 interacts with the ligand-
independent AF-1 and ligand-dependent AF-2 domains of
PPARg (Fig. 2) and thereby impairs its transcriptional
activities. The suppressed transcriptional activity of PPARg
attributable to the interaction with TRB3 was clearly ob-
served when the luciferase assays were carried out in 3T3-
L1 preadipocytes rather than in HEK293, HepG2, and
HeLa cells (data not shown). Although several different
tissues, including hepatocytes, express PPARg, it is pos-
sible that the TRB3-mediated suppression of PPARg
transcriptional activities might occur exclusively in the ad-
ipocytes in which PPARg2, an adipocyte-specific isoform,
and its essential cofactors are coexpressed. This might be
another example of the cell-specific TRB3 function dis-
cussed above. Further study will be necessary to resolve the
underlying diversity of TRB3 functions.
In the current study, we elucidated the roles of TRB3
in preadipocytes and adipocytes during differentiation. At
present, little is known about the precise functions of TRB3
in hypertrophic adipose cells in obesity. Because TRB3 and
PPARg coexist in mature adipocytes and mouse white adi-
pose tissues (data not shown), TRB3 is likely to modulate
the character of adipose cells bymodifying PPARg activities.
Thus, TRB3 is potentially an intriguing therapeutic target
for the treatment of insulin resistance and obesity.
