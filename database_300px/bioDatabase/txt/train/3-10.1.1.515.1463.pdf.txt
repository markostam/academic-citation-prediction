ABSTRACT
Within our everyday life, we are confronted with a
variety of toxic substances of natural or artificial
origin. Toxins are already used, e.g. in medicine,
but there is still an increasing number of toxic com-
pounds, representing a tremendous potential to
extract new substances. Since predictive toxicology
gains in importance, the careful and extensive inves-
tigation of known toxins is the basis to assess the
properties of unknown substances. In order to
achieve this aim,we have collected toxic compounds
from literature and web sources in the database
SuperToxic. The current version of this database
compiles about 60 000 compounds and their struc-
tures. These molecules are classified according to
their toxicity, based on more than 2 million measure-
ments. The SuperToxic database provides a variety
of search options like name, CASRN, molecular
weight and measured values of toxicity. With the
aid of implemented similarity searches, informa-
tion about possible biological interactions can be
gained. Furthermore, connections to the Protein
Data Bank, UniProt and the KEGG database are
available, to allow the identification of targets and
those pathways, the searched compounds are
involved in. This database is available online at:

INTRODUCTION
Toxins are hazardous substances, causing illness or
damage to an exposed organism if inhaled, swallowed or
absorbed through the skin. They can be found all over in
nature and are widely used as drugs in medicine, as toxic-
ity strongly depends on concentration.
In nature, animals and plants use toxic substances as
protection from predators. For example, poisonous mush-
rooms or plants use toxins to protect themselves against
herbivores. A lot of snakes, scorpions or spiders produce
poison to guard themselves from other animals. A number
of these substances, originally used by animals or plants to
poison their enemies, have become valuable within medi-
cine. In cancer treatment, Paclitaxel, a toxin from the Yew
tree (Taxaceae) (1), has been applied successfully in the
treatment of breast cancer. Vinorelbin, an alkaloid from
Cataranthus roseus, shows good results in the therapy of
diﬀerent carcinomas (2). Very successful in the ﬁght against
infection diseases are the toxins of a variety of fungi, the
antibiotics (3). These substances, originally produced from
themushroom to protect themselves against bacterial infec-
tions, depict a great breakthrough in medicine, as an
impressive amount ofmedical conditions can now be cured.
There are diﬀerent measurements to estimate toxicity:
LD50 and LC50 (lethal dose or concentration at which
50% of a population dies) are widely established but also
TGI (total growth inhibition), NOEL (no observable
eﬀects limit) or LOEL (lowest observable eﬀects level)
are used.
The wide use of toxins proves the scientiﬁc importance,
and confronts researchers with the question for the nature
of toxicity. What makes a compound toxic? How can
toxicity be detected for unknown compounds? To
answer these questions, a close investigation of toxic com-
pounds is inescapable, making it necessary to provide a
collection of toxins.
Databases like Mvir (4) or SCORPION (5) are excellent
sources for detailed information, for example, compounds

from Scorpiones or DNA and protein sequence analysis.
Admittedly, these databases are restrictively applicable for
complete consideration of the structural and chemical
properties of toxic compounds, within science and
industry.
To solve this problem, we established the database
SuperToxic, which provides a comprehensive collection
of toxins from diﬀerent sources (animals, plants, syn-
thetic, etc.), combined with chemical features, as well as
information about commercial availability. This dataset
enables a detailed investigation of the correlations
between chemical, functional and structural properties of
toxins.
Furthermore, these data can be used to evaluate the risk
of use for compounds within medicine or industry, and
give valuable insight into the mechanisms of toxicity.
While certain toxins aﬀect many types of cell lines, some
toxic compounds only interfere with deﬁned cell types
leading to a speciﬁc toxicity. Cytostatic drugs, which are
often used in chemotherapy, aﬀect the cell cycle or the
DNA replication mechanisms (6) and are therefore toxic
to all living cells, although tumorigenic cells are more
inﬂuenced due to their high rate of cell proliferation. In
contrast, omeprazole, a drug for the treatment of gastric
or duodenal ulcer, only aﬀects cells in the stomach, as it
needs an acidic environment to become active (7). Since it
is of great interest to ﬁgure out, whether a compound
interacts speciﬁcally with particular cells, SuperToxic is a
distinguished tool for the search of such information.
Additionally, the toxicity of an unknown substance
can be estimated by comparison with structurally similar
compounds with known toxicity. Another application of
this database is the estimation of health hazards for a
variety of chemicals, especially with respect to the new
European chemical management system REACH (regis-
tration, evaluation, authorization of chemicals) (8), a reg-
ulation for the registration, evaluation and conﬁnement
of chemicals. This regulation is necessary, as in many
chemical production processes, for example, fabrication
of colors, varnishes or leather, the usage of toxic com-
pounds is almost inevitable. Therefore, it is essential to
assess potential hazardous eﬀects, to safeguard such sub-
stances during transportation, usage and storage. The vast
usage of chemicals and new chemical registration pro-
grams, like REACH, demands alternatives to experimen-
tal validation. All producers or importers, who introduce
more than one ton per annum of a substance to the
European Union, must evaluate the chemical regarding
its toxicity, according to REACH. In order to reduce
cost-intensive animal testing of toxic compounds, the pro-
motion of data exchange (9–11) and predictive toxi-
cology gains importance and acceptance (12). There are
several theoretical approaches, besides QSAR (quantita-
tive structure–activity relationship) (13), which describe
the relationship between toxicity and physicochemical
properties of compounds. For such predictions, high qual-
ity, comprehensive and well-structured databases are
essential. The toxicity values and chemical information
given by SuperToxic provide such basis for hazard
assessment.
THE DATABASE
SuperToxic comprises data from publicly available
databases and scientiﬁc literature, assembling a vast
amount of toxic compounds. Currently, there are about
60 000 structures with corresponding properties stored in
the database. Additionally, properties like the number
of hydrogen bond (H-bond) donors and acceptors, mole-
cular weight or the octanol–water partition coeﬃcient
logP, which allow the evaluation of the Lipinski’s Rule
of Five (14), can be found within the database. The
web interface (available at http://bioinformatics.charite.
de/supertoxic) provides diﬀerent options to access the
data:
 Within the ‘Toxin Search’ option (Figure 1, I-A), it is
possible to perform a distinct search, given the name
of the compound, the Chemical Abstracts Services
Registry Number (CASRN) or NSC number, an iden-
tiﬁer of the National Cancer Institute database. A
search for a certain pathway lists all compounds asso-
ciated with this pathway.
 The ‘Structure Search’ option (Figure 1, I-B) allows a
structure upload via InChI (IUPAC International
Chemical Identiﬁer), SMILES (Simpliﬁed Molecular
Input Line Entry System) or MOL ﬁle. Additionally,
the structure can be drawn, using a built-in molecule
editor. The provided structure can either be used as
input for a similarity screening or a substructure
search.
 Another way to search the database is imple-
mented in the ‘Property Search’ (Figure 1, I-C).
Here, the deﬁnition of value ranges for certain
attributes (e.g. the molecular weight, the logP, the
number of rings, H-bond donors or acceptors) pro-
vides a list of all database entries fulﬁlling the
conditions.
 To browse the whole database, the user can choose an
alphabetic character or numbers, to display all data-
base entries starting with the selection. Alternatively,
all CASRN or NSC numbers, which are available in
the database, can be listed.
To demonstrate the functionality of the database, the
toxicity and the chemical characterization of a new
potential drug candidate (Hit1) is exemplarily evaluated:
the structure can either be uploaded as MOL ﬁle or be
drawn, using the molecule editor. The similarity search
results in a list of matches to the query compound ordered
by similarity (Figure 1 II, column 1–6). The following
information are given:

For each compound in the result table, a separate
‘Detailed View’ window (Figure 1, II-A) is provided, dis-
playing further structural and chemical properties, such as
number of rings, atoms, H-bond donors and acceptors,
rotatable bonds, SMILES, logP and molecular weight.
All these information can be downloaded in PDF
format, together with the atomic coordinates in MOL
format.
Some of the similar compounds, found for Hit1, like
Alfacalcidol (Figure 1 II, red boxes), for example, are
very toxic. This ﬁnding suggests that despite all the
other similar compounds found, which are only slightly
toxic, the candidate itself might be tested for toxicity start-
ing with very low concentrations.
Another useful feature of SuperToxic, is the user upload
interface, which allows the scientiﬁc community to contri-
bute to the database. There are several data required for
the upload: the structure, toxicological information (type
of toxicity, dose, unit, organism or cell line) and an email
address for further correspondence. After manual cura-
tion, the database will be updated with the new
compound.
METHODS
Data mining
SuperToxic was established on the basis of data from the
publicly available databases PubMed, DSSTox (15) and
NCI60 (16). Furthermore, the book ‘Biogene Gifte’ (17),
was manually surveyed, making the data available online
for the ﬁrst time. Toxicity data were collected from litera-
ture by extensive text mining. A searchable index from the
PubMed database was built. In the next step, the index
was ﬁltered for toxicity-related keywords and various pat-
terns, like units or IUPAC names. Finally, all relevant text
passages were manually curated in regard to the presence
of any toxicity information.
The data from all sources were merged to eliminate
duplicated compounds. The database currently contains
about 60 000 compounds. Also included, are references
to the origin of the compounds and about 600 entries in
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
(18). To detect potential targets in biochemical pathways
approximately 400 compounds were detected in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (19,20) and the corresponding
targets were linked via more than 800 KEGG and 3600
UniProt (21) entries.
Calculation of chemical properties
The calculations of chemical properties, e.g. molecular
weight and number of H-bond donors and acceptors,
were performed with functions from OpenBabel 2.1,
an open source chemical toolbox (22) (http://openbabel.
sourceforge.net/). To compute the properties for the struc-
tures, the MyChem extension (an implementation of the
OpenBabel 2.1 library for MySQL) was used (http://
mychem.sourceforge.net/).
Analysis of chemical and structural properties
For the complete dataset, the distributions of molecular
weight, LogP and H-bond donors and acceptors were ana-
lyzed, whereas drugs (23) and natural compounds (24)
served as reference groups.
A reduced dataset, derived from the NCI60 panel, was
subdivided into three toxicity groups, represented by log
(LC50): the slightly toxic, medium toxic and highly toxic
compounds.
For each group, the distribution of chemical properties
was calculated separately, to reveal interdependencies
regarding the toxicity. The results are shown under
‘Statistics’ on the SuperToxic website.
Structural fingerprint
The similarity search is performed, using so-called struc-
tural ﬁngerprints, a binary string with a length of 1536
bits, which encodes for the chemical characteristics of a
compound. Within this database, a combination of two
ﬁngerprints was used: (i) a 1024 bit ﬁngerprint based on
MDL; (ii) a 512 bit ﬁngerprint encoding for 317 structural
properties deﬁned as SMARTS pattern (http://www.
daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html), pro-
vided by OpenBabel (http://openbabel.org/wiki/FP2).
The ﬁrst one generates a ﬁngerprint for each chemical
structure, the second provides for exact structural pat-
terns. The application of this combined ﬁngerprint leads
to an improvement of the similarity and substructure
searches and yields in more detailed results. The ﬁnger-
prints of all compounds were precalculated and stored in
the database.
Similarity search
During the similarity search, the ﬁngerprint of the input
structure is built and compared with the ﬁngerprints of the
database entries using the Tanimoto coeﬃcient. It is a
similarity index and deﬁned as:
T ¼ Nab
Na þNb Nab
Na and Nb describe the number of bits, set to 1 in the
ﬁngerprint, of compound a and b, respectively. Nab is
the number of bit positions set to 1 in both ﬁngerprints.
A molecule with a Tanimoto coeﬃcient>0.85 to an active
compound is assumed to be biologically active itself (25).
The Tanimoto calculations are performed using MyChem.
Substructure search
For the substructure search, the database entries are ﬁl-
tered, according to the number of atoms and rings. Thus,
structures with less atoms or rings, compared with the
query molecule, are not considered narrowing down the
search space. Afterwards, the ﬁngerprint of the query

ow
nloaded from
 
structure is compared with the remaining database entries’
ﬁngerprints. If all bits set to one coincide, the query struc-
ture is a substructure of this database compound.
Server
SuperToxic is designed as a relational database, which is
implemented in a MySQL server. For chemical function-
ality, the MyChem/OpenBabel package is added. The web
access is enabled via an Apache Webserver 2.2. The web
site is built in PHP5 and HTML. For the molecule drawing
and uploading function, the tool MarvinSketch and for
visual inspection of compounds, Jmol (26) is implemented.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
SuperToxic is a rich source of toxicological data, combin-
ing structural, functional and chemical information, along
with corresponding toxicity values. Features, like similar-
ity screening and substructure search, enable to character-
ize and estimate the potential toxicity of substances which
have not been validated yet.
The application of SuperToxic might help to reduce the
amount of animal testing, e.g. for the risk assessment of
new drugs, or to fulﬁll the new EU REACH requirements.
Additionally, this database represents a valuable support
during toxin research, as the information about the com-
pounds will facilitate experimental design. The range of
toxicity, possible targets, mode of action and chemical
modiﬁcation to lower toxicity can be retrieved.
SuperToxic is planned for further enlargement, data
concerning peptides and proteins will be added, and eco-
toxicological information will be considered. In addition
to that, an upload function enables the scientiﬁc commu-
nity to contribute by adding new compounds or supple-
mentary information. In order to provide up-to-date
information the database will be updated twice a year.
