ABSTRACT
MODBASE (http://salilab.org/modbase) is a rela-
tional database of annotated comparative protein
structure models for all available protein sequences
matched to at least one known protein structure.
The models are calculated by MODPIPE, an auto-
mated modeling pipeline that relies on the
MODELLER package for fold assignment,
sequence±structure alignment, model building and
model assessment (http:/salilab.org/modeller).
MODBASE uses the MySQL relational database
management system for ¯exible querying and
CHIMERA for viewing the sequences and structures
(http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/). MODBASE is
updated regularly to re¯ect the growth in protein
sequence and structure databases, as well as
improvements in the software for calculating the
models. For ease of access, MODBASE is organized
into different data sets. The largest data set con-
tains 1 262 629 models for domains in 659 495 out of
1 182 126 unique protein sequences in the complete
Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database (August 25, 2003);
only models based on alignments with signi®cant
similarity scores and models assessed to have the
correct fold despite insigni®cant alignments are
included. Another model data set supports
target selection and structure-based annotation by
the New York Structural Genomics Research
Consortium; e.g. the 53 new structures produced by
the consortium allowed us to characterize structur-
ally 24 113 sequences. MODBASE also contains
binding site predictions for small ligands and a set
of predicted interactions between pairs of modeled
sequences from the same genome. Our other
resources associated with MODBASE include a
comprehensive database of multiple protein struc-
ture alignments (DBALI, http://salilab.org/dbali) as
well as web servers for automated comparative
modeling with MODPIPE (MODWEB, http://salilab.
org/modweb), modeling of loops in protein struc-
tures (MODLOOP, http://salilab.org/modloop) and
predicting functional consequences of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPWEB, http://salilab.
org/snpweb).
INTRODUCTION
Genome sequencing efforts are providing us with complete
genetic blueprints for hundreds of organisms, including
humans. We are now faced with assigning, understanding
and modifying the functions of proteins encoded by these
genomes. This task is generally facilitated by protein 3D
structures (1), which are best determined by experimental
methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR
spectroscopy.
Over the past 2 years, the number of sequences in the
comprehensive public sequence databases, such as Swiss-Prot/
TrEMBL (2) and GenPept (3), have increased by a factor of
2.3 from 522 959 to 1 208 659 on August 15, 2003. In contrast,
despite structural genomics, the number of experimentally
determined structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) increased by a factor of only 1.3 over the same period,
from 17 443 to 23 096 (4). Thus, the gap between the numbers
of known sequences and structures continues to grow.
Protein structure prediction methods are attempting to
bridge this gap (5). The most accurate models are generally
obtained by homology or comparative modeling (6).
Comparative modeling is carried out in four sequential
steps: ®nding known structures (templates) related to the
sequence to be modeled (target), aligning the target sequence
with the templates, building the model and assessing the
model. Therefore, comparative modeling is only applicable
when the target sequence is detectably related to a known

protein structure. Using automated comparative modeling, the
fraction of sequences with comparative models for at least one
domain has remained at ~57% over the past 2 years (7).
The utility of comparative protein structure models depends
on their accuracy. The accuracy of comparative modeling is
correlated with sequence identity between the template
structure and the modeled sequence (5). Protein structure
models with high accuracy can be obtained when template
structures with >50% sequence identity to the modeled
sequence are available. At this level of similarity, the errors
usually include some incorrectly packed side chains, small
shifts or distortions in the main chain and a few incorrectly
modeled loops. Comparative models with medium accuracy
are based on 30±50% sequence identity between the target and
template sequences. Such models tend to have additional
errors in some loop regions and occasional alignment errors.
Below 30% sequence identity, alignment and fold assignment
errors become the most signi®cant sources of mistakes in
comparative modeling. The accuracy of automated compara-
tive protein structure modeling has been quanti®ed by the
CAFASP effort (8) as well as automated web servers EVA (9)
and LIVEBENCH (10).
The process of comparative protein structure modeling
usually requires the use of a number of programs to identify
template structures, to generate sequence±structure align-
ments, to build the models and to evaluate them. In addition,
various sequence and structure databases that are accessed by
these programs are needed. Once an initial model is
calculated, it is generally re®ned and ultimately analyzed in
the context of many other related proteins and their functional
annotations. To facilitate these tasks for both expert and
novice users, we have developed several programs, servers
and databases (Fig. 1).
In this paper, we highlight the improvements of MODBASE
that were implemented since the previous reports (7,19,20).
These improvements include more sensitive and accurate
software for calculating comparative models, an updated
interface that relies on the CHIMERA package for viewing
alignments and structures, integration of information about
small ligand binding sites and protein±protein interactions
with the model data sets, measurement of the contributions of
structural genomics to the coverage of the sequence±structure
space, and closer integration with a variety of other resources
for deriving and using comparative models.
CONTENTS
MODBASE core
Models in MODBASE are calculated using MODPIPE, our
entirely automated software pipeline for comparative model-
ing (16). MODPIPE can calculate comparative models for a
large number of protein sequences, using many different
template structures and sequence±structure alignments.

MODPIPE relies on the various modules of MODELLER for
its functionality and is streamlined for large-scale operation on
a cluster of PCs using scripts written in PERL.
The templates used for model building consist of represent-
ative multiple structure alignments extracted from DBALI
(11). These alignments were prepared by the SALIGN module
of MODELLER (M. S. Madhusudan, M. A. Marti-Renom, A.
Sali, in preparation), which implements a multiple structure
alignment method similar to that in the program COMPARER
(21). Sequence pro®les are constructed for both the target
sequences and the templates by scanning against the Swiss-
Prot/TrEMBL database of sequences, relying on the BUILD_
PROFILE module of MODELLER (N. Eswar, M. S.
Madhusudhan and A. Sali, in preparation). BUILD_
PROFILE is similar to PSI-BLAST (22), except that local
dynamic programming is used instead of the BLAST heuris-
tics. Sequence±structure matches are established by aligning
the target sequence pro®le against the template pro®les, using
local dynamic programming in the SALIGN module and an
assessment of statistical signi®cance similar to that of PSI-
BLAST (22) and COMPASS (23). Signi®cant alignments
covering distinct regions of the target sequence are chosen for
modeling. Models are calculated for each of the sequence±
structure matches using MODELLER (24). The resulting
models are then evaluated by a composite model quality
criterion that depends on the compactness of a model, the
sequence identity of the sequence±structure match and
statistical energy Z-scores (25).
The thoroughness of a search for the best model is
modulated by a number of user parameters, including
E-value thresholds for identifying useful sequence±structure
relationships and the degree of conformational sampling given
a sequence±structure alignment. The validity of sequence±
structure relationships is not pre-judged at the fold detection
stage, but is assessed after the construction of the model and its
evaluation. This approach enables a thorough exploration of
fold assignments, sequence±structure alignments and con-
formations, with the aim of ®nding the model with the best
evaluation score.
The models in the version of MODBASE available until the
end of 2003, however, were calculated using an earlier version
of MODPIPE. These models were based on single template
structures and built using sequence±structure matches
generated by PSI-BLAST (22) and IMPALA (26).
Models in MODBASE are organized into data sets. The
largest data set contains models of all sequences in the Swiss-
Prot/TrEMBL database that are detectably related to at least
one known structure in the PDB. Currently, there are 1 262 629
models for domains in 659 495 of the 1 182 126 sequences in
the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database, with an average length of
235 residues per model. For example, there are models for
32 985 human sequences, 22 880 sequences from Arabidopsis
thaliana, 15 195 sequences from Drosophila melanogaster
and 9691 sequences from Escherichia coli. Because the
sequence databases contain sequence information of different
strains and mutations, the number of unique sequences for a
given organism exceeds the number of genes in the genome.
For example, there are about 16 700 unique E.coli sequences
in Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL, compared with ~4400 predicted
genes in the E.coli genome.
Predicted interacting proteins
MODBASE links pairs of modeled sequences from the same
organism that are predicted to interact with each other
(H. Braberg, F. Davis, J. Espadaler, B. Oliva, A. Sali, M. S.
Madhusudhan, in preparation). First, residue contacts between
the two models are predicted based on a match of both
modeled sequences to different parts of a single PDB ®le.
Next, the residue contacts in a hypothetical interface are
scored by their propensities to span an interface. These
propensities were extracted from ~8000 representative pairs of
interacting domains. If the total score is suf®ciently large, the
two modeled sequences are predicted to interact with each
other. The method is an extension of the Rosetta Stone
approach, which was ®rst applied to sequences (27) and is
similar to several studies applied to structures (28,29). ~10 000
modeled sequences in MODBASE are linked via ~30 000
predicted pairwise interactions, with an estimated false
positive ratio of 25%.
Predicted ligand binding sites
MODBASE contains a list of the binding sites of known
structure for ~50 000 ligands found in the PDB (30). The
ligands include small molecules, such as metal ions, nucle-
otides and saccharides, but exclude water molecules, peptides
and nucleic acids. Binding sites in the template structures are
de®ned by residues with atoms within 5 AÊ of any ligand atom.
In addition to the actual binding sites in the known structures,

both (`Fold and model').

MODBASE also contains predicted binding sites on the
template structures and models. The predicted binding sites on
the template structures are inherited from any related known
structure if at least 75% of the binding site residues are within
4 AÊ of the template residues in a global superposition of the
two structures and if at least 75% of the binding site residue
types are invariant. The structure superpositions are obtained
from our comprehensive database of all pairwise structure
superpositions, DBALI (11). The predicted binding sites on
the model are de®ned by all the model residues that are aligned
Figure 2. CHIMERA and the MultAlign Viewer extension. The barrel domains of selected enolase superfamily members are shown, with sidechains displayed
for active site metal-binding residues. The multiple sequence alignment contains the corresponding sequences with the metal-binding residues colored in the
same way. The CHIMERA interface allows user selections within the sequences, to highlight the corresponding regions of the structures and vice versa.

with either the actual or predicted binding site residues on the
template. Forty-four percent of the models in MODBASE
have at least one predicted binding site for a small ligand.
Application of MODBASE to structural genomics
MODBASE provides the basis for target selection and
structure-based annotation by the New York Structural
Genomics Research Consortium (NYSGXRC) (15), one of
the nine pilot centers in the Protein Structure Initiative
supported by the NIH (http://www.nigms.nih.gov/psi/). We
highlight here the increased coverage of the sequence±
structure space (31) by the NYSGXRC structures.
Relying on the 53 NYSGXRC structures, MODPIPE
produced models for domains in 24 113 sequences in
Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL (Table 1); the average target±template
sequence identity was 18.9%. Only 10% of the sequences are
modeled based on >30% sequence identity over more than 75
residues; 81% of the sequences have models that are predicted
to have the correct fold based on the model score or the PSI-
BLAST E-value (Table 1). The modeled sequences come from
1729 different organisms. Because the structures determined
by NYSGXRC were selected by avoiding more than 30%
sequence identity to any of the previously determined
structures, most of the modeled sequences have been
characterized structurally for the ®rst time. The large number
of models calculated based on the newly determined structures
illustrates and justi®es the premise of structural genomics.
ACCESS AND INTERFACE
MODBASE is queryable through the web at http://salilab.org/
modbase by PDB codes, Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL and GenPept
accession numbers, annotation keywords, model reliability,
model size, target±template sequence identity, alignment
signi®cance, and sequence similarity to the modeled
sequences as detected by BLAST.
Models in MODBASE are organized into a number of data
sets whose access by different users is regulated using a
cookie mechanism (http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/
cookies). The largest data set includes all modeled sequences
from the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database and is freely access-
ible to all academic scientists. Other data sets include models
calculated for NYSGXRC, MODWEB data sets from
anonymous users and data sets associated with our other
modeling projects.
The output of a search is displayed on pages with varying
amounts of information about the modeled sequences,
template structures, alignments and functional annotations.
These tables also contain links to other sequence, structure and
function annotation databases, such as PDB (4), GenBank (3),
Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL (2), CATH (32), Pfam (33), ProDom
(34), and UCSC Genome Browser (35). In addition,
MODBASE models are directly accessible from the Swiss-
Prot/TrEMBL sequence pages at http://www.expasy.org and
UCSC Genome Browser at http://genome.ucsc.edu.
Visualization of sequences, structures and alignments
with CHIMERA
To simplify the process of visualizing the models contained in
MODBASE, we created an extension to the CHIMERA
Molecular Modeling System, which was developed by the
researchers in the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization,
and Informatics at UCSF (Fig. 2) (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/
chimera) (30). The data contained in a MODBASE entry are
divided among three different ®les: a template ®le, a model ®le
and an alignment ®le. Manually downloading and opening
these ®les with visualization tools can be a cumbersome
process. The new CHIMERA extension enables a web
browser to communicate directly with CHIMERA. By click-
ing on a single link associated with each MODBASE model,
information related to the model is transmitted to CHIMERA,
which then displays the structures of the template and the
model; their alignment is also displayed using CHIMERA's
multiple sequence alignment viewer, MultAlign Viewer. The
user can then apply CHIMERA's rich set of visualization and
analysis tools to further study the model. CHIMERA runs on a
local computer and is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS
10.2, IRIX and COMPAQ Tru64 UNIX operating systems.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
MODBASE will be updated at least monthly to re¯ect the
growth of the sequence and structure databases, as well as
improvements in the methods and software used for calculat-
ing the models. We also plan to integrate access to the
sequence pro®les in the web-based interface and to include
tools for target selection for structural genomics. Furthermore,
we plan to improve the ¯exibility of searching for ligand
binding sites. And ®nally, we will include additional search
options to support associating structure and function.
