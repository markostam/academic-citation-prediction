ABSTRACT
The ability to store and interconnect all available
information on proteins is crucial to modern biologi-
cal research. Accordingly, the Universal Protein
Resource (UniProt) plays an increasingly important
role by providing a stable, comprehensive, freely
accessible central resource on protein sequences
and functional annotation. UniProt is produced by
the UniProt Consortium, formed in 2002 by the
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Protein
Information Resource (PIR) and the Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics (SIB). The core activities include
manual curation of protein sequences assisted by
computational analysis, sequence archiving, devel-
opment of a user-friendly UniProt web site and
the provision of additional value-added information
through cross-references to other databases. UniProt
is comprised of three major components, each opti-
mized for different uses: the UniProt Archive, the
UniProt Knowledgebase and the UniProt Reference
Clusters. An additional component consisting of
metagenomic and environmental sequences has
recently been added to UniProt to ensure availability
of such sequences in a timely fashion. UniProt is
updated and distributed on a bi-weekly basis and can
be accessed online for searches or download at
http://www.uniprot.org.
INTRODUCTION
High-throughput genome sequencing is producing a rapid and
accelerating accumulation of predicted protein sequences for
a large number of organisms. At the same time, protein func-
tions are being analyzed using a wide range of approaches,
ranging from traditional small-scale experiments to large-
scale methods such as gene expression profiling, protein-
protein interactions and structural genomics as well as
in silico prediction of protein functions. To accommodate
these data, various individual resources are available to the
research community. However, there is a widely recognized
need for a centralized repository of protein sequences with
comprehensive coverage and a systematic approach to protein
annotation, incorporating, integrating and standardizing data
from these various sources.
UniProt is the central resource for storing and interconnect-
ing information from large and disparate sources and the
most comprehensive catalog of protein sequence and func-
tional annotation. It has three components optimized for

different uses. The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is
an expertly curated database, a central access point for
integrated protein information with cross-references to
multiple sources. The UniProt Archive (UniParc) is a com-
prehensive sequence repository, reflecting the history of all
protein sequences (1). UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef)
merge closely related sequences based on sequence identity
to speed up searches. UniProt is built upon the extensive
bioinformatics infrastructure and scientific expertise at
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), Protein Information
Resource (PIR) and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB).
It is freely and easily accessible by researchers to conduct
interactive and custom-tailored analyses for proteins of
interest to facilitate hypothesis generation and knowledge
discovery.
CONTENT
UniProtKB
UniProtKB consists of two sections, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
and UniProtKB/TrEMBL. The former contains manually
annotated records with information extracted from literature
and curator-evaluated computational analysis. To achieve
accuracy, annotations are performed by biologists with
specific expertise. Information including function, catalytic
activity, subcellular location, disease, structure and post-
translational modifications is annotated. An important part
of the annotation process involves the merging of different
reports for a single protein. After a careful inspection of the
sequences, the annotator selects the reference sequence, does
the corresponding merging and lists the splice and genetic
variants along with disease information when available.
Any discrepancies between the different sequence sources
are also annotated. Cross-references are provided to the
underlying nucleotide sequence sources as well as to many
other useful databases including organism-specific, domain,
family and disease databases. UniProtKB/TrEMBL contains
high quality computationally analyzed records enriched
with automatic annotation and classification. The computer-
assisted annotation is created using automatically generated
rules as in Spearmint (2) or manually curated rules based
on protein families, including HAMAP family rules (3),
RuleBase rules (4) and PIRSF classification-based name
rules and site rules (5,6). UniProtKB/TrEMBL contains the
translations of all coding sequences present in the EMBL/
GenBank/DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Databases, the
sequences of PDB structures and data derived from amino
acid sequences that are directly submitted to the UniProtKB
or scanned from the literature. We exclude some types of
data such as DDBJ/EMBL/DDBJ entries that encode small
fragments, synthetic sequences, most non-germline
immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors, most patent sequences
and some highly over-represented data. Records are selected
for full manual annotation and integration into UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot according to defined annotation priorities.
UniRef
The UniRef databases provide three clustered sets
(UniRef100, 90 and 50) of sequences from UniProtKB
and selected UniParc records in order to obtain complete
coverage of sequence space at several resolutions while hid-
ing redundant sequences from view. The UniRef100 database
combines identical sequences and sub-fragments with 11 or
more residues into a single UniRef entry, which displays
the sequence of a representative protein, with the accession
numbers of all the UniProtKB entries within the cluster and
links to the corresponding UniProtKB and UniParc records.
UniRef90 and UniRef50 are built by further clustering
UniRef100 sequences with 11 or more residues using the
CD-HIT algorithm (7) such that each cluster is composed
of sequences that have at least 90 or 50% sequence identity,
respectively, to the representative sequence. Selection of the
representative sequence in each UniRef cluster is based on
the ranking of all the sequences in the cluster using the
following criteria in descending precedence:
(i) Quality of the entry: member entries from UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot section are preferred.
(ii) Meaningful name: entries with names that do not contain
non-biological or non-descriptive words, such as
hypothetical, probable, are preferred.
(iii) Organism: entries from model organisms are preferred.
(iv) Length of the sequence: longest sequence are preferred.
The UniRef databases are generated based on the UniProtKB
and UniParc databases, thus providing up-to-date collections
of sequences. UniRef100 is the most comprehensive and non-
redundant protein sequence dataset. UniRef90 and UniRef50
yield a database size reduction of 40 and 65%, respectively,
providing for significantly faster sequence similarity
searches. In addition, UniRef databases reduce the bias in
sequence searches by providing a more even sampling of
sequence space.
UniParc
UniParc is the main sequence storehouse and is a comprehen-
sive repository that reflects the history of all protein
sequences (1). UniParc houses all new and revised protein
sequences from various sources to ensure that complete
coverage is available at a single site. It includes not only
UniProtKB but also translations from the EMBL-Bank/
DDBJ/GenBank Nucleotide Sequence Databases, the
Ensembl database of animal genomes, the International Pro-
tein Index (IPI), the Protein Data Bank (PDB), NCBI’s Ref-
erence Sequence Collection (RefSeq), model organism
databases FlyBase and WormBase and protein sequences
from the European, American and Japanese Patent Offices.
To avoid redundancy, sequences are handled as strings—all
sequences 100% identical over the entire length are merged,
regardless of source organism. New and updated sequences
are loaded on a daily basis, cross-referenced to the source
database accession number and provided with a sequence
version that increments upon changes to the underlying
sequence. The basic information stored within each UniParc
entry is the identifier, the sequence, cyclic redundancy check
number, source database(s) with accession and version num-
bers and a time stamp. In addition, each source database
accession number is tagged with its status in that database,
indicating if the sequence still exists or has been deleted in
the source database. UniParc records are designed to be
without annotation since the annotation will be only true in

the real biological context of the sequence: proteins with the
same sequence may have different functions depending on
species, tissue, developmental stage, etc.

NEW FEATURES
UniSave
The UniProtKB Sequence/Annotation Version database
(UniSave) is a comprehensive archive of UniProtKB entry
versions (8). All changed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and
UniProt/TrEMBL entries are added to UniSave on a bi-
weekly basis to coincide with the UniProtKB releases.
UniSave is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/unisave.
ID mapping
UniProt provides a mapping service to convert common gene
IDs and protein IDs to UniProtKB AC/ID and vice versa.
Mappings are either inherited from cross-references within
UniProtKB entries or are based on the existing mappings
between EMBL and GenBank entries, while others make
use of cross-references obtained from the iProClass database
(9). This service is available at http://www.uniprot.org/
search/idmapping.shtml, where users can map between
UniProtKB and >30 other data sources such as NCBI (e.g.
gi numbers, RefSeq accession numbers, Entrez Gene IDs,
PubMed IDs), GO (www.geneontology.org/), PFAM (www.
sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) and PIRSF (pir.georgetown.
edu/pirsf.shtml). In addition, users can also download
selected mappings in the form of a tab-delimited table from
ftp://ftp.pir.georgetown.edu/databases/iproclass/.
Format changes
Recent format changes. A number of UniProtKB format
changes have recently been introduced to improve data
consistency:
(i) The DT line (DaTe) changed from showing only the
dates corresponding to full UniProtKB releases to
displaying the date of the bi-weekly release at which
an entry is integrated or updated. The information
concerning the release number has been dropped and the
entry and sequence version numbers in the DT lines
were introduced instead. The sequence version number
of an entry is incremented by one when its amino acid
sequence is modified, whereas the entry version number
is incremented by one whenever any data in the flat file
representation of the entry is modified.
(ii) A new line type has been introduced to viral entries to
indicate the host(s) either as a specific organism or
taxonomic group of organisms. This line has been
termed OH for Organism Host and contains the host
name and taxonomy ID.
(iii) The CC line (Comment) topic DATABASE has been
replaced by WEB RESOURCE to clarify the conceptual
difference between the content of these lines and the DR
(Database cross-Reference) lines.
(iv) Pre-translational events have so far been represented by
several feature keys. To improve the consistency of
annotation of pre- and co-translational events, the
feature key VARSPLIC was removed and the new
feature key VAR_SEQ created for the description of
alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, alter-
native initiation and ribosomal frameshifting.
Forthcoming format changes.
(i) The format of the ID line will be changed to better
reflect the annotation status of an entry. The current
STANDARD and PRELIMINARY data classes will be
replaced by ‘Reviewed’ (entries that have been manually
reviewed and annotated by UniProtKB curators) and
‘Unreviewed’ (computer-annotated entries that have not
been reviewed by UniProtKB curators), respectively. In
addition, the MoleculeType field, which is a legacy of
compatibility with the EMBL flat file format, will be
dropped.
(ii) Since in most cases protein sequences are derived from
translation of nucleotide sequences and there may or
may not be definitive experimental evidence for their
existence, a new line type will be introduced to indicate
the evidence for the existence of a protein (PE line). The
PE line will have one of the following values: ‘evidence
at protein level’, ‘evidence at transcript level’, ‘inferred
from homology’ or ‘predicted’. Unreviewed entries will
have an additional value, ‘unassigned’. However, it
should be noted that the PE line will not give
information on the correctness of the sequence.
(iii) As mentioned before, the feature key INIT_MET is only
used to indicate that the initiator methionine has been
cleaved off. Currently, the initiator methionine is not
included in the sequence of a UniProtKB entry in such a
case and the INIT_MET sequence coordinates are
therefore 0. The initiator methionine will be added back
to such protein sequences and the sequence coordinates of
the feature key INIT_MET accordingly changed to 1.
(iv) The FASTA header line of UniProtKB and UniRef
entries will be standardized. In the former case the
format will consist of >UniqueIdentifierjEntryName
ProteinName—OrganismName, whereas in the latter it
will follow the following format: >UniqueIdentifier
Cluster: ClusterName; n ¼ Members; TaxonjRep:
ProteinName—OrganismName.
 For UniProtKB, the UniqueIdentifier is the primary
accession number of the UniProtKB entry or, in the
case of entries that describe several protein isoforms,
an isoform identifier; EntryName is the entry name of
the UniProtKB entry; ProteinName is the recom-
mended or submitted protein name of the UniProtKB
entry (this is the name before the first bracket,
excluding ‘precursor’ but including ‘Fragment’ if

appropriate); OrganismName is the scientific name of
the organism of the UniProtKB entry. Examples:
>P24856jANP_NOTCO Ice-structuring glycoprotein
(Fragment)—Notothenia coriiceps neglecta
>P51650-1jSSDH_RAT Succinate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase—Rattus norvegicus
 For UniRef, the UniqueIdentifier is the primary
accession number of the UniRef cluster; ClusterName
is the name of the UniRef cluster; Members is
the number of UniRef cluster members; Taxon is the
scientific name of the lowest common taxon shared by
all UniRef cluster members; ProteinName is the
protein name of the representative member of the
UniRef cluster; OrganismName is the scientific name
of the organism of the representative member of
the UniRef cluster. Example:
>UniRef50_P24856 Cluster: Ice-structuring glycopro-
tein (Fragment); n ¼ 15; HolacanthopterygiijRep:
Ice-structuring glycoprotein (Fragment)—Notothenia
coriiceps neglecta
 UniParc is not represented here as its header is purely
the UniParc accession number.
RECENT CHANGES
New documents
A number of documents, available both by ftp and on the
Web site, have been added. The document nameprot.txt
lists a number of rules for naming proteins to standardize
the nomenclature for a given protein across related organ-
isms, with the hope that authors/laboratories will follow as
much as possible these rules for naming new proteins. The
document orysa.txt lists all the Oryza sativa (rice) entries of
the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot section with the corresponding
chromosome locus, the UniProtKB accession number, entry
name, the description and the gene name(s). The document
scorpktx.txt lists the potassium-channel-specific scorpion
toxins known to date (10,11) along with the UniProtKB
accession number, the entry name and the systematic name.
Finally, the document ptmlist.txt contains the controlled
vocabulary and associated feature keys for post-translational
modifications.
Metagenomic and environmental sequences
Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL sections of the UniProtKB contain
entries with a known taxonomic source. However, a new
development in sequence production—namely, the availabil-
ity of metagenomic data—has necessitated the creation of a
separate section, UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental
Sequences (UniMES).
UPCOMING DEVELOPMENTS
Annotation of UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries
To improve the quality of the protein names in UniProtKB/
TrEMBL, an effort is underway to start manually curating
protein names using protein PIRSFs and their accompanying
name rules and/or site rules (5,6). It is important to note that
all the protein names will be checked manually prior to
updating the individual UniProtKB/TrEMBL record. In the
context of the Human Proteome Initiative annotation
program, the protein names and gene symbols of representa-
tive human entries in UniProtKB/TrEMBL will be updated so
as to provide the community with a cleaner human proteome
set that encompasses the 15 000 reviewed human entries in
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and about 5000 as yet unreviewed
human UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries.
DATABASE ACCESS AND FEEDBACK
UniProt is freely available for both commercial and non-
commercial use. Please see http://www.uniprot.org/terms for
