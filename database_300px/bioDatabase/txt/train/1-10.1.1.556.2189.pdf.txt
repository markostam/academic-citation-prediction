ABSTRACT
The homeotic Abdominal-B (Abd-B) gene expres-
sion depends on a modular cis-regulatory region
divided into discrete functional domains (iab) that
control the expression of the gene in a particular
segment of the fly. These domains contain regula-
tory elements implicated in both initiation and main-
tenance of homeotic gene expression and elements
that separate the different domains. In this paper we
have performed an extensive analysis of the iab-6
regulatory region, which regulates Abd-B expres-
sion at abdominal segment A6 (PS11), and we have
characterized two new polycomb response ele-
ments (PREs) within this domain. We report that
PREs at Abd-B cis-regulatory domains present a
particular chromatin structure which is nuclease
accessible all along Drosophila development and
both in active and repressed states. We also show
that one of these regions contains a dCTCF and
CP190 dependent activity in transgenic enhancer-
blocking assays, suggesting that it corresponds to
the Fab-6 boundary element of the Drosophila
bithorax complex.
INTRODUCTION
The three homeotic genes of the Drosophila bithorax com-
plex (BX-C), Ultrabithorax (Ubx), abdominal-A (abd-A)
and Abdominal-B (Abd-B), are responsible for specifying
the identity of the posterior parasegments of the ﬂy. The
expression of these genes is regulated by a complex cis-
regulatory region covering 300 kb of DNA divided into
nine segment/parasegment-speciﬁc subregions, which con-
trol expression of a single homeotic gene in a particular
parasegment. Diﬀerent studies have led to the identi-
ﬁcation of speciﬁc cis-regulatory sequences responsible
for establishment (initiator elements) and maintenance
polycomb response element (PRE regulatory elements)
of homeotic gene expression. Early in development, gap
and pair-rule genes initiate parasegment-speciﬁc patterns
of expression which are then maintained by two ubiqui-
tously expressed groups of proteins, the polycomb group
(PcG) and the trithorax group (TrxG), responsible for the
silenced and activated states respectively. Both groups
of proteins are thought to maintain the active or inactive
state by modifying the chromatin structure of each cis-
regulatory domain (1–3). A special class of cis-acting
elements known as boundary elements or insulators are
proposed to exist between each iab domain to allow
their autonomy to properly specify segmental identity.
Until now, only three of these elements, Miscadastral
pigmentation (Mcp), Frontabdominal-7 (Fab-7) and
Frontabdominal-8 (Fab-8), have been functionally identi-
ﬁed (4–8), and the characterization of genomic deﬁciencies
covering part of the iab-5 and iab-6 cis-regulatory domains
has allowed to infer the existence of a putative Fab-6
boundary element (9). Although proteins responsible for
the boundary function of these elements remain largely
unknown, it has been reported that some insulator binding
proteins, such as GAGA, dCTCF and CP190 are asso-
ciated in vivo with some of these elements(10–14) and con-
tribute to the enhancer-blocking activity (10,11,15).
Here, we report on the identiﬁcation of two new PREs
in the Abd-B iab-6 regulatory region and on the character-
ization of a dCTCF-CP190-dependent activity associated
to one of them. Overall, our work constitutes an extensive
analysis of the regulatory elements in the iab-6 domain of
the BX-C and provides evidence that a boundary activity,
always located near a PRE, exists between each of the cis-
regulatory domains that control Abd-B expression.

the B+P7 construct, from position 3R:12707732 to

to 3R:12713610 for HS3 and from 3R:12708102 to
3R:12708620 ﬂanked by FRT sites for HS1.
Fly strains and heat-shock treatments
Drosophila mutant alleles of PcG proteins, Psch27, Pc3 and
ph-p410, were obtained from the Bloomington Stock
Center. dCTCFy+6 and CP190H31–2 mutant ﬂies (11,16)
were obtained from V. G. Corces.
The enhancer-blocking assays in mutant backgrounds
were performed using double balanced lines to obtain
ﬂies heterozygous for the transgen that carry the mutation
in either heterozygous or homozygous states on a diﬀerent
chromosome for comparison to heterozygous transgenic
ﬂies.
Lines with HS1 excisions were obtained by crossing
females expressing ﬂp recombinase under the control of
the heat-shock promoter (p[hsFLP],y1,w1118; Dr[Mio]/
TM3,ry,Sb1 from the Bloomington Stock Center) with
transgenic males. Heat-shock of embryos  24 h old were
carried out for 1 h/every day. In the following generation
ﬂies were selected for a change in eye colour and excisions
were conﬁrmed by PCR analysis. For each transgenic line
the eye colour of heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked ﬂies
were compared.
DNAseI assays
Nuclei extraction from Drosophila embryos and third
instar larvae were performed as described before (12,17).
About 30 ml of embryos and 20 larvae were used per
sample and DNAseI digestions were performed with
increasing amounts of enzyme (0–10 U for embryo and
0–50U for larvae nuclei) for 3min at 48C. DNA samples
were cleaved and labelled as indicated in the ﬁgure
legends. Samples restricted with KpnI were hybrid-
ized with probe 1 (from position 3R:12717132 to
3R:12717707); samples restricted with HindIII with
probe 2 (from position 3R:12713610 to 3R:12714662)
and samples restricted with PstI (3R:12711182)/SacI
(3R:12714662) were hybridized with probe 3 (from posi-
tion 3R:12711233 to 3R:12711648).
ChIP assays
Dechorionated embryos 4–20 h old were crosslinked for
15min in 50mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1mM EDTA, 0.8mM
EGTA and 100mM NaCl with 2.5% formaldehyde and 3
v/v heptane. Embryos were resuspended in lysis buﬀer (1%
SDS, 50mMTris pH 8, 10mMEDTA, protease inhibitors)
and sonicated in a Branson soniﬁer set at 35% output, 20 s
for 4 times. Subsequent steps were done as previously
described (12) except that immunoprecipitations were
carried out in RIPA buﬀer (1% Triton-X100, 0.1% Na
Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140mM NaCl, 10mM Tris
HCl pH 8, 1mMEDTA, 1mMPMSF). Antibodies against
Pc were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA (sc-25762). PCR ampliﬁcation of
the resulting DNA was performed by standard procedures
using the following primers: PRE7, 50GTCGGC

mide. Immunoprecipitated DNA was also analysed by
Real-time qPCR (Thermocycler ABI 7000) using SYBR
Green and standard settings (Applied Biosystems, Foster

RESULTS
Identification of DNAseI hypersensitive sites
within the iab-6 domain of the BX-C
Regulatory regions that control the expression of eukar-
yotic genes are frequently hypersensitive to digestion with
nucleases (18,19), as it has been shown for some regula-
tory elements implicated in homeotic gene expression
(4,20,21). Since mapping DNAseI hypersensitive (HS)
sites could be an accurate method for identifying the loca-
tion of functional regulatory elements, we have analysed
the accessibility to DNAseI over the whole regulatory
iab-6 domain of the BX-C locus that controls Abd-B
expression in the parasegment 11/abdominal segment 6
(PS11/A6). DNAseI digestion of Drosophila embryos
revealed the existence of two major DNAseI HS sites
(indicated by big arrows in Figure 1A) located around
positions 3R:12709k (HS1) and 3R:12713k (HS2) along
the BX-C sequence and two minor HS sites (indicated
by small arrows in Figure 1A), HS3 located near the
major HS2 site and HS4 located around position
3R:12719k. The scheme presented in Figure 1A shows
the position, along the cis-regulatory iab-6 domain, of
the diﬀerent HS sites here characterized. Several types of
regulatory elements implicated in homeotic gene regula-
tion have been identiﬁed in the past that include initi-
ator elements, maintenance elements (PREs), chromatin

boundaries and promoter targeting sequences (1–3).
So far, only one regulatory element has been characterized
within the iab-6 cis-regulatory domain, which corresponds
to an initiator element that shows a maintenance activ-
ity at later stages of embryogenesis (9). Since this element
has been shown to be located between positions
3R:12716438 and 3R:12719280, we speculated that HS4
probably corresponds to the IAB6 initiator element pre-
viously characterized.
We have analysed the genomic regions containing the
other hypersensitive sites here identiﬁed, HS1, HS2 and
HS3, and we have found that they contain several consen-
sus binding sequences for proteins known to be implicated
in the maintenance phase of homeotic gene regulation
(data not shown), such as the GCCAT sequence which
is found at most pleiohomeotic binding sites and the
GAGAG consensus sequence recognized by the GAGA
factor (22,23). Thus, we asked whether these genomic
regions correspond to regulatory elements implicated in
maintenance of Abd-B expression.
Analysis of the PRE activity of iab-6HS sites
To analyse the capacity of a DNA sequence to have PRE
activity a P-element transgene whiteenhancer-mini-white has
been used in the past (4,23,24). It has been shown that in
the absence of a regulatory element the white enhancer
drives a high level of white expression in the eye, giving
a red eye colour. However, when a PRE is inserted
between enhancer and promoter, it acts as a silencer and
transgenic ﬂies show repression of white and pairing-
dependent silencing (silencing is enhanced in the presence
of two copies of the transgene).
We used a similar whiteenhancer-mini-white construct to
analyse the presence of a PRE in the diﬀerent HS regions
identiﬁed above. First, as a control, we inserted a 2.3 kb
fragment with the previously characterized Fab-7 region
containing both the boundary and PRE elements between
the white enhancer and the mini-white reporter gene. When
this construct was introduced into ﬂies, 50% of the trans-
genic lines obtained showed silencing in heterozygous

animals and 60% showed pairing-dependent silencing
(Figure 2A). The percentage of silencing and pairing-
sensitive silencing obtained in our assays was similar to
that reported earlier for constructs carrying the Fab-7 or
Fab-8 elements of the BX-C (4,24). Then, we introduced
into ﬂies constructs containing the diﬀerent HS sites here
identiﬁed in the iab-6 regulatory domain and tested for
silencing and pairing-sensitive silencing.
When a 1.15 kb PCR fragment covering the distal HS1
site (see Figure 1B, HS1 construct) was inserted, 40% of
the transgenic lines obtained showed silencing of white
expression, heterozygous animals having orange or
yellow eye colour (Figure 2A). Moreover, ﬂies homozy-
gous for the inserted transgene showed pairing-dependent
repression of the white reporter gene in 50% of the lines
(Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained with a 1.6 kb
EcoRI-SacII restriction fragment covering both HS2 and
HS3 hypersensitive sites (see Figure 1B, HS2+3 con-
struct). In this case, 40% of the transgenic lines obtained
had orange or yellow eyes and 40% of the lines showed
enhanced silencing in homozygous animals when com-
pared to their heterozygous siblings (Figure 2A), suggest-
ing that these HS regions correspond to PREs.
To test whether silencing of the white reporter gene by
the HS fragments depends on PcG genes, transgenic lines
were placed in polyhomeotic, Polycomb and posterior sex
combs mutant backgrounds. At least three diﬀerent trans-
genic lines of both HS1 and HS2+3 constructs showed
increased white expression in more than one mutant back-
ground. This is illustrated in Figure 2B for polyhomeotic
(ph) and posterior sex combs (Psc) in representative lines
showing repression of white and pairing-dependent
repression respectively (transgenic lines HS2+3 4.2
and 3.1).
To further characterize the genomic region containing
HS2 and HS3 sites, we took advantage of a ScaI restric-
tion site located at position 3R:12712760 (see Sc in
Figure 1). Since this site is ﬂanked by both nuclease hyper-
sensitive regions (data not shown), we inserted either a
0.93 kb XbaI-ScaI fragment containing the major HS2
site or a 0.85 kb ScaI-HindIII fragment that includes the
minor HS3 site in the whiteenhancer-mini-white construct
(see Figure 1B, HS2 and HS3, respectively). We examined
18 independent lines for construct HS3 but only one
showed repression of white (Figure 2A) probably as a
consequence of the genomic location of the transgene.
These results indicate that the HS3 region is not important
for PRE activity and further demonstrate that white
expression in whiteenhancer-mini-white constructs is almost
no dependent on the genomic location of the transgene.
On the contrary, the eye phenotype of transgenic lines
carrying the 0.93 kb HS2 fragment is similar to that of
the lines containing the 1.6 kb HS2+3 fragment (compare
HS2 and HS2+3 in Figure 2A). Furthermore, silencing in
transgenic HS2 lines depend on Polycomb protein (data
not shown). Thus, our results show that the HS2 fragment
is necessary and suﬃcient for PRE function and that
sequences covering the minor HS3 site are dispensable,
showing no activity in these assays. Overall, our data
indicate that these two regions HS1 and HS2 correspond
to PREs.
The distribution of PcG proteins over the entire BX-C
complex has been analysed in Drosophila cultured
cells and binding of several components of the PRC1
complex to a region between Mcp and Fab-7 has been
reported (25,26). Sequences corresponding to the HS1
region were identiﬁed as PRC1 and Trx binding sites
and a Trx site that could correspond to HS2 was shown
to be present in cell lines that express Abd-B (26).
To determine the in vivo binding of PcG proteins to
these regions in Drosophila embryos, we performed ChIP
experiments using a Polycomb-speciﬁc antibody.
Immunoprecipitated DNA was analysed by either stan-
dard PCR procedures or real-time qPCR (Figure 3A
and B, respectively). As shown in Figure 3, while a nega-
tive control sequence did not show any Polycomb associa-
tion, Pc binding to both HS1 and HS2 regions was
similar to that obtained for a previously characterized
PRE of the BX-C (PRE7). In conclusion, we have identi-
ﬁed two new PREs within the iab-6 cis-regulatory domain
of the BX-C.

these particular chromatin structures are established and
whether they are present all along Drosophila development
we performed DNAseI digestion of Drosophila 0–4 h
embryos and third instar larvae. Our analyses showed
that HS sites at either the iab-6 PRE element HS2
(Figure 4A) or the Fab-7 element (data not shown) are
already present early in development and are maintained
throughout development until late third instar larvae.
On the contrary, the HS4 site, which corresponds to the
IAB6 initiator element, is clearly seen in embryos whereas
it is absent later in development in third instar larvae
(Figure 4B).
PREs are responsible for the activity of homeotic genes
in some tissues and their repression in others. Thus, we
wanted to establish whether DNAseI hypersensitivity cor-
relates with activity of the PRE. For this purpose we ana-
lysed the pattern of DNAseI digestion of one of the
transgenic lines described above carrying a P-element
whiteenhancer-mini-white construct containing the HS2
fragment (transgenic line HS2 9.2) which showed silencing
and pairing-sensitive silencing. As shown in Figure 4C,
ﬂies with one copy of the transgene had an orange eye
colour while ﬂies carrying two copies showed eye pigmen-
tation close to that of white animals, indicating that in
HS2 9.2 homozygous animals white expression is totally
repressed by the PRE. The assays performed showed the
presence of a DNAseI HS site in the transgene at the
genomic location corresponding to the ectopic HS2
fragment (Figure 4C), both in heterozygous and homozy-
gous animals. Similar results were obtained in transgenic
lines carrying a functional Fab-7 element (data not
shown). These results indicate that HS sites are present
at PREs that are responsible for partial or fully repressed
reporter genes.
Characterization of a boundary activity in the HS1
genomic region
By genetic analysis with genomic deﬁciencies covering
several kb of DNA, it has been suggested that there may

be a boundary Fab-6 element, located between positions
3R:12708067 and 3R:12712604, responsible for the auton-
omy of iab-5 and iab-6 cis-regulatory domains (9). A well
known enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, the CTCF
protein, has been shown to be associated in vivo with sev-
eral regions of the bithorax complex, one of them located
around position 3R:12708500 (14). The HS1 site, here
characterized as a PRE, is located at this position and
we postulated that it might also contain a boundary activ-
ity. We have analysed the eﬀect of dCTCF mutation on
silencing of white reporter gene in heterozygous animals
carrying the HS1 region. Any relief from enhancer-
blocking should allow the communication between the
whiteenhancer and the promoter of the white gene and
increase eye colour. As shown in Figure 5A, a small but
signiﬁcant increase in eye colour was seen in a null dCTCF
background, similar to data reported earlier for the Fab-8
boundary element of the BX-C (10,11,27).
To delimit the sequence conferring blocking activity
to the HS1 region we have used a FLP-FRT recombina-
tional system in order to perform more accurate enhancer-
blocking assays. A 0.5 kb fragment (HS1) containing
the dCTCF binding sites previously identiﬁed (14)
was inserted between the whiteenhancer and the mini-white
reporter gene. When this construct was introduced into
ﬂies, 40% of the transgenic lines obtained showed silen-
cing of white expression. Since HS1 fragment was ﬂanked
by FRT sites, crosses with ﬂies expressing ﬂp recombinase
would lead to recombination between the two FRTs and
deletion of the fragment (Figure 5B). When the transgenes
were subjected to ﬂp recombination they showed increased
white expression (Figure 5B). These results indicate that
silencing of the reporter gene depends on the presence
between enhancer and promoter of a fragment of only
0.5 kb that contains the two dCTCF binding sites.
However, we have not been able to totally isolate the
boundary element since some of these transgenic lines
showed pairing-sensitive silencing, indicating that the
HS1 fragment still contains some PRE activity (data
not shown).
Finally, we have analysed the requirement of another
insulator protein, CP190, to the activity of these elements
in transgenic assays. It has been previously reported that
CP190 participates in the functionality of Fab-8 in
enhancer-blocking assays (10,11). We have found that
mutation of a single copy of CP190H31–2 gives rise to a
signiﬁcant relief in silencing induced by fragments con-
taining the Fab-7 boundary element (Figure 5C, B+P7).
In contrast, no eﬀect was seen in HS2+3 transgenic ﬂies
which contain a PRE element (Figure 5C, HS2+3). These
results suggest that CP190 should be a required compo-
nent at the other boundary elements of the BX-C. It has
been recently reported that CP190 is associated in vivo
with several regions of the BX-C, one of them located in
the HS1 region (10). Therefore, we have analysed the
eﬀect of CP190 mutation on HS1 enhancer blocking
and we have found that transgenic ﬂies carrying one
copy of CP190H31–2 showed increased white expression

(Figure 5C, HS1). Altogether these observations suggest
that a boundary activity depending on dCTCF and CP190
proteins is likely to be present in the HS1 genomic region.
DISCUSSION
In this study we have used DNAseI HS sites to localize
regulatory elements in the BX-C locus and we have char-
acterized two new PREs in the Abd-B iab-6 regulatory
region. Our results show that HS sites at PREs are present
all along development while the HS site at the initiator
element IAB6 is present in embryo but no at larval
stages (9). Previous work had shown that several PREs
from the BX-C are hypersensitive to nucleases in late
embryos (4,20) and it has also been shown that the
MCP regulatory element is hypersensitive to nucleases in
early embryos (20) and the bxdPRE from the Ubx regula-
tory region is nuclease accessible in larvae (8). Altogether,
these studies strongly suggest that these unusual chroma-
tin structures can be associated to the functionality of the
regulatory element being present at PREs not only in early
embryos, when the activity state of the BX-C homeotic
genes in each parasegment is established, but also at
larval stages, well into the maintenance phase of BX-C
regulation.
ChIP analyses performed over the entire Ubx region in
Drosophila tissues that either express or not the gene have
shown that PREs contain lower levels of core and linker
histones, suggesting that either histone epitopes are
masked by PcG or TrxG complexes or these regions are
nucleosome free (28–30). We have found that Abd-B PREs
are nuclease accessible in PRE copies carried by transpo-
sons independently of the silencing activity of the PRE,
supporting the idea that these regulatory regions are
depleted of nucleosomes in both ON and OFF transcrip-
tional states. Therefore, although PcG silencing have been
proposed to be associated to DNA compaction (31,32),
our results indicate the contrary and favour a model, sup-
ported by recent data from other groups, that invokes
interaction between PREs and core promoters (33–35),
broad H3K27 trimethylation of the region, absence of
H3K4 trimethylation from the promoter and transcription
initiation blockage (36,37).
Based on data from several laboratories, a model has
been proposed to summarize the current understanding of
how BX-C functions. In this model, each distinct regula-
tory domain contains a modular arrangement of func-
tional elements for the regulation of homeotic gene
expression in a particular parasegment with boundary ele-
ments keeping each domain separate and autonomous (2).
Although there are genetic evidences of the relevance of
boundary elements in Abd-B gene regulation, the mechan-
ism by which they function and the proteins implicated are
still mostly unknown. dCTCF, which in vertebrates binds
to and participate to the function of all insulators char-
acterized to date (8), and CP190, which has been reported
to be essential for gypsy insulator activity (16), have been
shown to be associated in vivo with several Drosophila
BX-C boundary elements (10) and to contribute to the
enhancer-blocking activity of the Fab-8 element (10,11).
Our observation that Fab-7 activity also depends on
CP190 suggests that this protein must be a common
player in all the boundary activities within the BX-C locus.
Although we have not been able to separate HS1
boundary and PRE elements, several observations point
to a role of this region in maintaining the autonomy of
iab-5 and iab-6 cis-regulatory regions; it has been reported
earlier that dCTCF and CP190 insulator proteins bind to
the HS1 region in Drosophila embryos (10,14) and our
results indicate that both proteins are required for the
function of this region in transgenic enhancer-blocking
assays. These ﬁndings lead us to propose that this region
may contain the Fab-6 boundary element of the BX-C.
Boundary elements in both Fab-7 and Fab-8 regions are
located in the vicinity of PREs, with each regulatory ele-
ment marked by diﬀerent DNAseI HS sites (4,6). In con-
trast, the boundary activity of the Mcp element is ﬂanked
on both sides by regulatory elements that cooperatively
repress white expression in transgenic lines (5) and this
regulatory region presents a single HS site (20). Our results
suggest that the boundary activity of the HS1 fragment
is likely to be similar to the Mcp element, since it cor-
responds to a single DNAseI hypersensitive site and
boundary and PRE activities seem to be much more
intermingled.
