Abstract
We consider N × N Hermitian random matrices with independent identically distributed entries
(Wigner matrices). The matrices are normalized so that the average spacing between consecutive eigen-
values is of order 1/N . Under suitable assumptions on the distribution of the single matrix element, we
first prove that, away from the spectral edges, the empirical density of eigenvalues concentrates around
the Wigner semicircle law on energy scales η ≫ N−1. This result establishes the semicircle law on the
optimal scale and it removes a logarithmic factor from our previous result [6]. We then show a Wegner
estimate, i.e. that the averaged density of states is bounded. Finally, we prove that the eigenvalues of a
Wigner matrix repel each other, in agreement with the universality conjecture.

1 Introduction
Let H = (hij) be an N ×N hermitian matrix, N ≥ 2, and let µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ . . . ≤ µN denote its eigenvalues.
These matrices form a hermitian Wigner ensemble if the matrix elements,
hij = h¯ji = N
−1/2zij ∈ C, (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N), and hii = N−1/2xii ∈ R, (1 ≤ i ≤ N) (1.1)
are independent random variables with mean zero. We assume that zij (i < j) all have a common distribution
ν with variance
∫
C
|z|2dν(z) = 1 and with a strictly positive density function h : R2 → R+, i.e.
dν(z) = (const.)h(x, y)dxdy where x = Re z, y = Im z.
We will often denote g := − logh. Throughout the paper we also assume that
either h(x, y) = h∗(x)h∗(y), or h(x, y) = h∗(x2 + y2) (1.2)
with some positive function h∗ : R → R+, i.e. either the real and imaginary parts of the random variables
zij , i < j, are independent and identically distributed, or the distribution depends only on the absolute value
|zij |. The diagonal elements, xii, also have a common distribution, dν˜(x) = (const.)e−eg(x)dx with g˜ : R → R.
Let P and E denote the probability and the expectation value, respectively, w.r.t the joint distribution of
all matrix elements. The normalization (1.1) of the matrix elements and fixing the variance of dν to be one
ensure that the spectrum of H is [−2, 2] + o(1) with probability one in the limit as N →∞.
For the special case g(x, y) = x2+y2, g˜(x) = x2/2, the hermitian Wigner ensemble is called the Gaussian
Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Due to the unitary invariance of the GUE matrices, the joint eigenvalue distri-
bution can be explicitly expressed in terms of a Vandermonde determinant and all correlation functions are
computable (see [12] for an overview). This approach can be applied for more general ensembles with unitary
invariance, i.e. for ensembles where the distribution is invariant under the transformation H → U−1HU for
any unitary matrix U (for a general overview via the Riemann-Hilbert approach see [4]). In particular, the
density of the eigenvalues converges to the Wigner semicircle law as N → ∞ and the truncated two-point
correlation function, appropriately rescaled, is given by the famous Wigner-Dyson sine-kernel in the bulk
spectrum, see [4, 13] and references therein (near the spectral edges a different universal statistics holds).
Higher order correlations can be expressed as determinants involving the sine-kernel. The order statistics
of eigenvalues can also be computed. The most important one is the nearest-neighbor level statistics, or
gap distribution, i.e. the distribution of the difference between two consecutive eigenvalues, µα+1 − µα, in
the bulk. With an appropriate rescaling, the density function f(x) of the eigenvalue gap is universal. It is
characterized by f(x) ∼ x2 near 0 that corresponds to a strong level repulsion. The large distance behavior,
f(x) ∼ exp(−x2), x≫ 1, expresses a strong supression of large eigenvalue gaps.
These properties of the eigenvalue statistics are conjectured to hold for much more general matrix en-
sembles beyond the invariant ensembles, in particular for general Wigner matrices. Numerical evidences
very strongly support these conjectures, nevertheless only a few rigorous results are known for ensembles
without unitary invariance (notable exceptions are the universality of the Tracy-Widom distribution for the
extremal eigenvalues [14] and the Wigner-Dyson sine-kernel for Wigner matrices with Gaussian convoluted
distributions [9]). In this paper we prove the strong level repulsion and a subexponential estimate for the
large distance behavior of the gap distribution.
For Wigner matrices, the Wigner semicircle law has been long established on scale of order 1, i.e. the
empirical counting measure of the eigenvalues (also called empirical density of states measure in physics),
2
̺N (E) =
1
N
∑N
α=1 δ(E−µα), converges weakly to ̺sc(E)dE (see (2.4)) in probability as N →∞ (see [15] for
the original result). The weak convergence does not allow one to identify the local density of eigenvalues on
energy scales η ≪ 1. Note that the number of eigenvalues in any interval of length η within [−2, 2] is typically
of order Nη, so the self-averaging property is expected to hold for the smoothed density of states as long as
the smoothing is on scale η ≫ 1/N . In Section 6, using a necessary a-priori bound from Section 5, we prove
that the semicircle law holds on the smallest possible scales, i.e. for any interval of length η ≫ 1/N (Theorem
3.1). This removes the logarithmic factor in our previous work [6] and establishes the optimal result. As a
corollary, we obtain an optimal result on the delocalization of the eigenvectors (Corollary 3.2). The proof
is a bootstrap argument in η; it relies on (non-optimal) bounds on the supremum norm of the eigenvectors,
which in turn, can be obtained by first establishing the semicircle law on a larger scale η ≥ (logN)4/N .
Although the semicircle law on a larger scale and bounds on the eigenvectors were already established in [6],
the error bound was not sufficiently strong. Therefore, in Section 4, we first improve the results of [6].
In Section 7 we give an upper bound on the tail distribution of the distance between consecutive eigenval-
ues (Theorem 3.3). The bound is only subexponential in contrast to the expected Gaussian decay. In Section
8 we prove the Wegner estimate for Wigner matrices, i.e. that the averaged density of states, E ̺N (E), is
uniformly bounded (Theorem 3.4). Note that the Wegner estimate is an information on arbitrarily short
scales, i.e. it is uniform in η. On scales η . 1/N , however, the smoothed empirical density of states truly
fluctuates since individual eigenvalues near E dominate, but the averaged density of states remains bounded.
Finally, in Section 9 we establish an upper bound f(x) ≤ Cx2 for the density function of the eigenvalue
spacing in the regime where x is small (Theorem 3.5). Apart from the constant, this upper bound coincides
with the prediction obtained from the universality conjecture on the level spacing distribution and it proves
that the level repulsion in Wigner matrices is as strong as in the GUE ensemble. We also give an optimal
estimate on higher order level repulsion. We show that the probability that there are k eigenvalues in a
small spectral interval I, with |I| = ε/N (ε ≪ 1), is bounded from above by Cεk2 in accordance with the
prediction from GUE that is based upon the explicit formula for the joint density function ∼∏j<ℓ(µℓ−µj)2
of k eigenvalues.
We work with hermitian Wigner matrices, but our method applies to symmetric Wigner matrices as
well. In that case, the level repulsion is weaker, f(x) ≤ Cx, in accordance with the explicit gap distribution
function for Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE).
We need to assume further conditions on the distributions of the matrix elements in addition to (1.1),
(1.2):
C1) There exists a δ0 > 0 such that
D :=
∫
C
exp
[
δ0|z|2
]
dν(z) <∞, D˜ :=
∫
R
exp
[
δ0x
2
]
dν˜(x) <∞ . (1.3)
To establish the Wegner estimate and the level repulsion, we need some smoothness property of the density
function h. We assume that
C2) The Fourier transform of the functions h and h(∆g), with g = − logh, satisfies the decay estimate
|ĥ(t, s)| ≤ 1
[1 + ωa(t2 + s2)]
a , |ĥ∆g(t, s)| ≤ 1
[1 + ω˜a(t2 + s2)]
a (1.4)
with some exponent a ≥ 1 and constants ωa, ω˜a > 0. (Note that aωa ≤ 14 by the condition that the
variance is 1.)
3
In our previous papers [5, 6] we assumed that dν satisfies the logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the proof of
the analogue of Lemma 4.2 (Lemma 2.1 of [6]). M. Ledoux has kindly pointed out to us that by applying a
theorem of Hanson and Wright [8], this lemma also holds under the moment condition C1) only. We remark
that the original paper [8] assumed that dν was symmetric; this conditon was later removed by Wright [16].
Another assumption we made in [5, 6] states that either the Hessian of g = − log h is bounded from
above or the distribution is compactly supported. This was needed because we used Lemma 2.3 of [5],
whose original proof required the condition on Hess g. An alternative proof of this lemma was given by
Bourgain (the proof reproduced in the Appendix of [6]) under the additional condition that the support of
dν is compact. In this paper, we extend the results of [8, 16] and apply them to prove a weaker but for our
purposes still sufficient version of Lemma 2.3 in [5]. This approach requires no additional condition apart
from C1). Condition C2) will play a role only in Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 3.5.
In our previous papers [5, 6] we assumed that the real and imaginary parts of zij are independent. It is
straightforward to check that all results of [5, 6] hold for the case of radially symmetric distributions (second
condition in (1.2)) as well.
Convention. We assume condition C1) throughout the paper and every constant may depend on the
constants δ0, D, D˜ from (1.3) without further notice.

from a result of Hanson and Wright [8].
2 Notation and the basic formula
For any spectral parameter z = E + iη ∈ C, η > 0, we denote the Green function by Gz = (H − z)−1. Let
F (E) = FN (E) be the empirical distribution function of the eigenvalues
F (E) := FN (E) =

Its statistical average, E ̺(E), is called the averaged density of states. We define the Stieltjes transform of
F as
m = m(z) =

η
(µα − E)2 + η2 (2.3)
be the normalized density of states of H around energy E and regularized on scale η. We note that ̺(E) =
limη→0+0 ̺η(E). The random variable m and the random measures ̺ and ̺η also depend on N , when
necessary, we will indicate this fact by writing mN , ̺N and ̺η,N .

For any z = E + iη, η 6= 0, we let
msc = msc(z) =

be the Stieltjes transform of the Wigner semicircle distribution function whose density is given by
̺sc(E) =

4− E21(|E| ≤ 2) . (2.4)
Let B(k) denote the (N − 1)× (N − 1) minor of H after removing the k-th row and k-th column. Note
that B(k) is an (N − 1)× (N − 1) Hermitian Wigner matrix with a normalization factor off by (1 − 1N )1/2.
Let λ
(k)
1 ≤ λ(k)2 ≤ . . . ≤ λ(k)N−1 denote its eigenvalues and u(k)1 , . . . ,u(k)N−1 the corresponding normalized
eigenvectors.
Let a(k) = (hk,1, hk,2, . . . hk,k−1, hk,k+1, . . . hk,N )∗ ∈ CN−1, i.e. the k-th column after removing the
diagonal element hk,k = hkk. Computing the (k, k) diagonal element of the resolvent Gz, we have
Gz(k, k) =

∣∣ {α : λ(k)α ≤ x}∣∣.
The spectral parameter z is fixed in most of the proofs and we will often omit it from the argument of the
Stieltjes transforms. Let Ek denote the expectation value w.r.t the random vector a
(k). The distribution of
B(k), a(k) and ξ
(k)
α does not depend on k, so we will often omit this superscript when it is unnecessary.
For any spectral interval I ⊂ R, we denote
NI := #{α : µα ∈ I}
N (k)I := #{α : λ(k)α ∈ I}
the number of eigenvalues in I of H and B(k), respectively. When we are interested only in the distribution
of N (k)I , we drop the superscript k, but to avoid confusion with NI , we denote by N λI a random variable
with the common distribution of N (k)I .
With these notations, the following basic upper bound on NI follows immediately:

Proposition 2.1 Let I = [E − η/2, E + η/2] be an interval of length η > 0 about the spectral point E ∈ R
and let z = E + iη. Then we have the following estimate on the number of eigenvalues in I:

3 Main results
The first main result establishes the semicircle law on the optimal scale η ≥ O(1/N); the proof will be given
in Section 6.
Theorem 3.1 Let H be an N × N hermitian Wigner matrix satisfying the condition C1). Let κ > 0 and
fix an energy E ∈ [−2 + κ, 2 − κ]. Then there exist positive constants C, c, depending only on κ, and a
universal constant c1 > 0 such that the following hold:
(i) For any δ ≤ c1κ and N ≥ 2 we have
P(|m(E + iη)−msc(E + iη)| ≥ δ) ≤ C e−cδ
√
Nη (3.1)
for any K/N ≤ η ≤ 1, where K = 300/c0 and c0 := π̺sc(E) > 0.
(ii) Let Nη∗(E) = NI∗ denote the number of eigenvalues in the interval I∗ := [E − η∗/2, E + η∗/2]. Then
for any δ ≤ c1κ there is a constant Kδ, depending only on δ, such that
P
{∣∣∣Nη∗(E)
Nη∗
− ̺sc(E)
∣∣∣ ≥ δ} ≤ C e−cδ√Nη∗ (3.2)
holds for all η∗ satisfying Kδ/N ≤ η∗ ≤ 1 and for all N ≥ 2.
As a corollary to this theorem, we can formulate a result on the eigenvectors:
Corollary 3.2 Let H be an N×N hermitian Wigner matrix satisfying the condition C1), then the following
hold:
(i) For any κ > 0 and K > 0 there exist constants C = C(κ,K) and c = c(κ,K) such that for any interval
I ⊂ [−2 + κ, 2− κ] of length |I| ≤ K/N we have
P
{
∃ v with Hv = µv, ‖v‖ = 1, µ ∈ I and |v1| ≥ M
N1/2
}
≤ Ce−c
√
M (3.3)
for all M ≥ 0 and N ≥ 2.
6
(ii) For any κ > 0, K > 0, and 2 ≤ p <∞ there exist C = C(κ,K, p) and c = c(κ,K, p) > 0 such that for
any interval I ⊂ [−2 + κ, 2− κ] of length |I| = K/N we have
P
{
∃ v with Hv = µv, ‖v‖ = 1, µ ∈ I and ‖v‖p ≥MN 1p− 12
}
≤ Ce−c
√
M (3.4)
for all M ≥ 0 and all N ≥ 2.
(iii) For any κ > 0 there exist C = C(κ) and c = c(κ) such that
P
{
∃ v with Hv = µv, ‖v‖ = 1, µ ∈ [−2 + κ, 2− κ] and ‖v‖∞ ≥ M
N1/2
}
≤ Ce−c
√
M (3.5)
for all M ≥ (logN)4 and all N ≥ 2.
The second main result is an upper bound on the tail distribution of the eigenvalue gap; the proof is
given in Section 7.
Theorem 3.3 Let H be an N × N hermitian Wigner matrix satisfying the condition C1). Let κ > 0 and
fix an energy E ∈ [−2 + κ, 2− κ]. Denote by λα the largest eigenvalue below E and assume that α ≤ N − 1.
Then there are positive constants C and c, depending on κ, such that
P
(
λα+1 − E ≥ K
N
, α ≤ N − 1
)
≤ C e−c
√
K (3.6)
for any N ≥ 1 and any K ≥ 0.
The third main result is the Wegner estimate for the averaged density of states:
Theorem 3.4 Let H be an N × N hermitian Wigner matrix satisfying the condition C1) and condition
C2) with an exponent a = 5 in (1.4). Let κ > 0, 0 < ε ≤ 1 and set η = ε/N . Let NI be the number of
eigenvalues in I := [E − η/2, E + η/2]. Then there exists a constant C such that
P(NI ≥ 1) ≤ E N 2I ≤ C ε (3.7)
uniformly for all N ≥ 10, for all E ∈ [−2 + κ, 2− κ] and for all ε ≤ 1. In particular,
sup
I⊂[−2+κ,2−κ]
sup
N≥10
E
[ NI
N |I|
]
≤ C , (3.8)
and therefore the averaged density of states, E ̺N (E), is an absolutely continuous measure with a uniformly
bounded density, i.e.
sup
|E|≤2−κ
sup
N≥10
E ̺N (E) ≤ C (3.9)
(with a slight abuse of notations, E ̺N (E) denotes the measure and its density as well). The constant
C in (3.7), (3.8) and (3.9) depends only on κ and on the constants characterizing the distribution dν
via the conditions C1)–C2). The estimates (3.7)–(3.9) hold for N ≤ 10 as well if, instead of C1)
and C2), we assume that the density function, (const.) exp(−g˜), of the diagonal matrix elements satisfies∫
R
|g˜′(x)| exp(−g˜(x))dx <∞.
7
Remark. The proof of Theorem 3.4 also gives a bound on the moments of the Stieltjes transform. By
inspecting the first step of the proof, we actually prove the stronger bound
sup
E∈[−2+κ,2−κ]
sup
N≥10
sup
0<Nη≤1
(Nη)E |m(E + iη)|2 ≤ C(κ) (3.10)
and then we deduce (3.8) from this estimate by using N 2I /(Nη) ≤ CIm m(E + iη) ≤ C|m(E + iη)|. The
same argument used to prove (3.7) also gives bounds on higher moments of NI , of the form
sup

sup

(3.11)
uniformly in ε ≤ 1 with a constant C depending only on k and κ. Both (3.10) and (3.11) extend to the case
N ≤ 10, under the additional assumption ∫
R
|g˜′(x)| exp(−g˜(x))dx < ∞ on the density (const.) exp(−g˜(x))
of the diagonal elements.
Finally, the following theorem establishes an upper bound on the level repulsion.
Theorem 3.5 Let H be an N ×N hermitian Wigner matrix satisfying the condition C1). Let κ > 0, ε > 0
and set η = ε/N . Let NI be the number of eigenvalues in I = [E − η/2, E + η/2]. Fix k ∈ N, and assume
that condition C2) holds with a = k2 + 5. Then, there exists a constant C > 0, depending on k and κ, such
that
P(NI ≥ k) ≤ C εk2 (3.12)
uniformly for all ε > 0, for all N ≥ N0(k) and for all E ∈ [−2 + κ, 2− κ].
All these estimates hold away from the spectral edges, i.e. for κ > 0, and the constants that are indicated
to depend on κ blow up as κ → 0. It is possible to obtain the asymptotic dependence of the constants
on κ by following the proofs but the formulae are complicated. In some simpler cases we computed these
formulae, see the remarks after Theorem 4.1 and 4.8.
The common starting point of all proofs is Proposition 2.1. Using the estimate Im(a+bi)−1 ≤ (a2+b2)−1/2
on the right hand side of (2.7), we have
NI ≤ Cη

where ak and bk are the imaginary and real part, respectively, of the reciprocal of the summands in (2.7).
Theorems 3.1 and 3.3 rely only on the imaginary part, i.e. bk in (3.13) will be neglected. In the proofs of
Theorems 3.4 and 3.5, however, we make an essential use of bk as well. Since typically 1/N . |λ(k)α −E|, we
note that a2k is much smaller than b

k if η ≪ 1/N and this is the relevant regime for the Wegner estimate and
for the level repulsion. Assuming a certain smoothness condition on the distribution dν (condition C2)), the
distribution of the variables ξ
(k)
α will also be smooth. Although ξ

α are not independent for different α’s,
they are sufficiently decorrelated so that the distribution of bk inherits some smoothness which will make
the expectation value (a2k + b

−p/2 finite for certain p > 0. This will give a bound on the p-th moment on
NI which will imply (3.7) and (3.12).

4 Semicircle law and delocalization on intermediate scales
In this section we review the proof of the convergence to the semicircle law on intermediate energy scales
of the order η ≥ (logN)4/N . This convergence has already been established in our previous work [6] but
with a speed of convergence uniform in η, for η ≥ (logN)8/N . Our new estimate shows that the speed
of convergence becomes faster as η increases (and we also reduce the power of the logarithm from 8 to 4).
Moreover, we show that the results hold under the condition C1) only. Thus we obtain a stronger version
of our earlier results under weaker assumptions.
The following result is an analogue of Theorem 3.1 for intermediate scales. It states that the density
of states regularized on any scale η ≥ N−1(logN)4 converges to the Wigner semicircle law in probability
uniformly for all energies away from the spectral edges. Note, however, that the estimate for larger scales is
sufficiently strong so that uniformity in the spectral parameter z can be obtained which is not expected for
short scales.
Theorem 4.1 Let H be an N × N hermitian Wigner matrix satisfying the condition C1). There exist a
universal constant c1 > 0, and positive constants C, c, depending only on κ, such that the following hold:
(i) Let the energy scale η be chosen such that (logN)4/N ≤ η ≤ 1. Then the Stieltjes transform mN (z)
(see (2.2)) of the empirical eigenvalue distribution of the N ×N Wigner matrix satisfies
P
{
sup

|mN (E + iη)−msc(E + iη)| ≥ δ
}

√
Nη (4.1)
for any δ ≤ c1κ and N ≥ 2.
(ii) Let Nη∗(E) = NI∗ denote the number of eigenvalues in the interval I∗ = [E − η∗/2, E + η∗/2]. Then,
for any δ ≤ c1κ there is a constant Kδ such that
P
{
sup
|E|≤2−κ
∣∣∣Nη∗(E)
Nη∗
− ̺sc(E)
∣∣∣ ≥ δ} ≤ C e−cδ√Nη∗ (4.2)
holds for all η∗ satisfying Kδ(logN)4/N ≤ η∗ ≤ c2κ/Kδ and for N ≥ 2. In other words, on the scale
η∗ with (logN)4/N ≪ η∗ ≪ 1 we have the convergence of the counting function as well.
Remark. It is possible to follow the dependence of the constants on the distance from the spectral edges.
For example, (4.1) can be replaced by the bound
P
{
sup
E∈[−2+κ,2−κ]
|mN (E + iη)−msc(E + iη)| ≥ δ
}
≤ Ce−cδ
√
Nηκ
for all δ ≤ c1κ, (logN)4/N ≤ η ≤ 1 and N ≥ 2, for constants C, c, c1 > 0 independent of κ.
Proof. This theorem is proven exactly as Theorem 1.1 in [6] after replacing the key Lemma 2.1 of [6]
by the following Lemma 4.2. M. Ledoux has informed us that Lemma 2.1 of [6] follows from a result of
Hanson and Wright [8]. We will reproduce his argument in the proof of Proposition 4.3. This requires only
Proposition 4.5 below, which is a mild extension of the Hanson-Wright theorem to the complex case.

Lemma 4.2 Let E ∈ [−2+κ, 2−κ]. Suppose that vα and λα are eigenvectors and eigenvalues of an N ×N
random hermitian matrix B with a law satisfying the assumption of Theorem 4.1. Let
X =
1
N
∑
α
ξα − 1
λα − z
with z = E + iη, ξα = |b · vα|2, where the components of b are i.i.d. random variables, independent of B
and satisfying the condition C1). Then there exists a positive constant c (depending on κ) so that for every
δ > 0, we have
P[|X | ≥ δ] ≤ 5 e−cmin{δ
√
Nη, δ2Nη} (4.3)
if Nη ≥ (logN)2 and N is sufficiently large (independently of δ).
For simplicity, we formulated the lemma for N ×N matrices, but it will be applied for the (N − 1)× (N− 1)
minors of H .
Proof of Lemma 4.2. Define the intervals In = [E − 2n−1η,E + 2n−1η] and let M and K0 be sufficiently
large fixed numbers. We have [−K0,K0] ⊂ In0 with n0 = C log(K0/η) ≤ C log(NK0). Denote by Ω the
event
Ω := Ω(M,K0) =
{
max
n
NIn
N |In| ≥M
}
∪ {max
α
|λα| ≥ K0} , (4.4)
where NIn = |{α : λα ∈ In}| is the number of eigenvalues in the interval In. Therefore, if Pb denotes the
probability w.r.t. the variable b, we find
P[|X | ≥ δ] ≤ E
[
1Ωc · Pb
[|X | ≥ δ]]+ P(Ω) .
We will prove below the following two propositions which complete the proof of Lemma 4.2.
Proposition 4.3 Assume condition C1). Let Ω = Ω(M,K0) be given by (4.4) and let η ≥ 1/N . Then for
sufficiently large and fixed M,K0 there is a positive c = c(M,K0) such that for any δ > 0
E
[
1Ωc · Pb
[|X | ≥ δ]] ≤ 4 e−cmin{δ√Nη, δ2Nη} .
Proposition 4.4 Assume condition C1). Let η be chosen such that (logN)2/N ≤ η ≤ 1. Then for
sufficiently large and fixed M and K0 there are positive constants c, C such that
P
[
Ω(M,K0)
] ≤ Ce−c√MNη . (4.5)
for all N ≥ 2.
Both results are based on a theorem of Hanson and Wright [8], extended to non-symmetric variables by
Wright [16]. The result was formulated for real valued random variables. We do not know if their theorems
hold for general complex random variables, but they hold true in two special cases, namely when either the
real and imaginary parts of bj are i.i.d. or if the distribution of bj is rotationally symmetric (see (1.2)). We
formulate this easy extension of their result and we give the proof in the Appendix.
10
Proposition 4.5 Let bj, j = 1, 2, . . .N be a sequence of complex i.i.d. random variables with distribution dν
satisfying the Gaussian decay (1.3) for some δ0 > 0. Suppose that condition (1.2) holds, i.e. either both the
real and imaginary parts are i.i.d. or the distribution dν is rotationally symmetric. Let ajk, j, k = 1, 2, . . .N
be arbitrary complex numbers and let A be the N ×N matrix with entries Ajk := |ajk|. Define
X =
N∑
j,k=1
ajk
[
bjbk − Ebjbk
]
.
Then there exists a constant c > 0, depending only on δ0, D from (1.3), such that for any δ > 0
P(|X | ≥ δ) ≤ 4 exp (− cmin{δ/A, δ2/A2}) ,
where A := (TrAAt)1/2 = [∑j,k |ajk|2]1/2.
Proof of Proposition 4.3. Write X in the form
X =
N∑
j,k=1
ajk
[
bjbk − Ebjbk
]
,
where
ajk =
1
N
∑

We have
A2 :=

On the set Ωc we have

where we estimated the number of eigenvalues in In \ In−1 by NIn and we set I−1 := ∅. Using Proposition
4.5 we obtain that
E
[
1Ωc · Pb[|X | ≥ δ]
]
≤ 4 exp (− cmin{δ√Nη, δ2Nη})
where the constant c depends on M and on δ0, D from (1.3). This completes the proof of Proposition 4.3.
Remark. The same result can be proven by assuming that the distribution dν satisfies the logarithmic
Sobolev inequality, see Lemma 2.1 of [6]; the bound exp (−cδ(logN)2) obtained there can be easily improved
to C exp (−cδ√Nη) since the exceptional set Ω is defined differently.
Proof of Proposition 4.4. Under condition C1), we showed in Lemma 7.4 of [5] that
P{max
α
|λα| ≥ K0} ≤ Ce−cK20N (4.7)
for sufficiently large K0. To estimate the large deviation of NIn , we use the following weaker version of
Theorem 2.1 of [5].
11
Theorem 4.6 Assume condition C1). There exists constants c, C > 0, and K0 such that
P
{|mN (x+ iy)| ≥ K} ≤ Ce−c√KNy (4.8)
for all x ∈ R, y > (logN)/N , N ≥ 2 and K ≥ K0. In particular, if I ⊂ R is an interval with length
|I| ≥ (logN)/N , we have
P
{NI ≥ KN |I|} ≤ Ce−c√KN |I| . (4.9)
Combining (4.7) and (4.9) and recalling Nη ≥ (logN)2, we have
P(Ω) ≤ C log(NK0)e−c
√
MNη + Ce−cK

0N ≤ Ce−ec

completing the proof of Proposition 4.4.
Proof of Theorem 4.6. The proof of (4.9) is the same as the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [5] but in the
estimate (2.20) at the end of the proof we use the following lemma instead of Corollary 2.4 to Lemma 2.3
from [5]:
Lemma 4.7 Assume condition C1). Let the components of the vector b ∈ CN−1 be complex i.i.d. variables
with a common distribution dν and let ξα = |b · vα|2, where {vα}α∈I is an orthonormal set in CN−1. Then
for δ ≤ 1/2 there is a constant c > 0 such that
P
{∑
α∈I
ξα ≤ δm
} ≤ e−c√m (4.10)
holds for any I, where m = |I| is the cardinality of the index set I.
We remark that a stronger bound of the form e−cm was proven in Lemma 2.3 [5] under the condition
that Hess g is bounded and in the special case when g(x, y) was in the form g(x) + g(y). An alternative
proof under the condition that the support of dν is compact is due to J. Bourgain and it is reproduced in the
Appendix of [6]. Using the stronger e−cm bound in (4.10), the bound in (4.9) can be improved to e−cKN |I|.
Here we present a proof that gives the weaker bound but it uses no additional assumption apart from C1)
and (1.2).
We also note that although the statement of Theorem 2.1 of [5] only gives an upper bound on the density
NI/(N |I|) for an interval I = [E − η/2, E + η/2], in its proof, this quantity is first estimated by
NI
N |I| ≤ CIm mN(E + iη) ≤ C|mN (E + iη)| ≤
C
N
∑
k
∣∣∣∣ 1HN − E − iη (k, k)
∣∣∣∣ ,
and then we controlled the absolute value of the diagonal elements of the resolvent. Hence, effectively, the
proof of Theorem 2.1 of [5] provides an upper bound for the absolute value of the Stieltjes transform m(z),
not just for its imaginary part. This yields (4.8) and it completes the proof of Theorem 4.6.
Proof of Lemma 4.7. Let
X :=
N∑
i,j=1
aij
[
bibj − E bibj
]
, with aij :=
∑
α∈I
vα(i)vα(j) .
12
Notice that
∑
α∈I ξα = X + |I| = X +m since E ξα = 1. By δ ≤ 1/2 we therefore obtain
P
{∑

Since

for some c > 0.
Using Theorem 4.1, we can prove delocalization of the eigenvectors of H . In Theorem 1.2 of [6] we proved
that ‖v‖∞ ≤ (logN)9/2/N1/2 holds for all eigenvectors with probability bigger than 1 − e−c(logN)2 . The
following theorem is a generalization of this result using the stronger estimates from Theorem 4.1.
Theorem 4.8 Let H be an N ×N hermitian Wigner matrix satisfying the condition C1). For any κ > 0
there exist constants C, c > 0, depending on κ such that
P
{
∃ v with Hv = µv, ‖v‖ = 1, µ ∈ [−2 + κ, 2− κ] and ‖v‖∞ ≥ M
N1/2
}
≤ Ce−c
√
M (4.11)
for all M ≥ (logN)4 and all N ≥ 1 large enough.
Remark. Analogously to Theorem 4.1, it is possible to follow the κ-dependence of the bound (4.11). One
finds
P
{
∃ v with Hv = µv, ‖v‖ = 1, µ ∈ [−2 + κ, 2− κ] and ‖v‖∞ ≥ M
N1/2
}
≤ Ce−cκ
√
M
for all M ≥ (logN)4 and N ≥ 2.
Proof of Theorem 4.8. Let η∗ =M/N and partition the interval [−2+κ, 2−κ] into n1 = O(1/η∗) ≤ O(N)
intervals I1, I2, . . . , In1 of length η
∗. As before, let NI = |{β : µβ ∈ I}| denote the number of eigenvalues
in I. Let
c1 := ̺sc(2 − κ) = min
{
̺sc(E) : E ∈ [−2 + κ, 2− κ]
}
> 0 .
By using (4.2) in Theorem 4.1 and the fact that Nη∗ ≥ (logN)4, we have

(4.13)
13
where a = (h1,2, . . . h1,N )
∗ and B is the (N − 1) × (N − 1) matrix obtained by removing the first row and
first column from H . Let λα and uα (for α = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1) denote the eigenvalues and the normalized
eigenvectors of B. Similarly to [6], from the eigenvalue equation Hv = µv and from (4.13) we find for the
first component of v = (v1, v2, . . . , vN ) that
|v1|2 = 1

where in the second equality we set ξα = |

Na · uα|2 and used the spectral representation of B. We recall
that the eigenvalues of H , µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ . . . ≤ µN , and the eigenvalues of B are interlaced: µ1 ≤ λ1 ≤ µ2 ≤
λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λN−1 ≤ µN and the inequalities are strict with probability one (see Lemma 2.5 of [5]). This
means that there exist at least NIn − 1 eigenvalues of B in In. Therefore, using that the components of any
eigenvector are identically distributed, we have

4.7 to estimate the first probability in the fourth line of (4.15) and (4.12) to estimate the second one.
5 Upper bound for the density on short scales
Now we start our analysis on short scales η ≥ 1/N . As before, we always assume condition C1) in addition
to (1.2). We first show a large deviation upper bound on the number of eigenvalues on short scales about a
fixed energy E away from the spectral edges. This complements the estimate in Theorem 4.6 that was valid
for larger scales.
Theorem 5.1 Let κ > 0 and fix an energy E ∈ [−2 + κ, 2 − κ]. Let ν, β be positive numbers such that
ν + 4β < 1/2. Let η > 0 with 1 ≤ Nη ≤ CNβ. Let
N := #{α : µα ∈ Iη := [E − η/2, E + η/2]} .
Then for any 2 ≤M ≤ CNβNη , we have

All constants depend on κ.
Remark. Similarly to the remark at the end of the proof of Theorem 4.6, we actually prove bounds on the
absolute value of the Stieltjes transform mN (z). So, instead of (5.1), we actually show the stronger bounds
P (|mN (E + iη)| ≥M) ≤

To estimate the large deviation of Z(k), we will later prove the following lemma:
Lemma 5.2 Let ν, β be positive numbers such that ν + 4β < 1/2. Then for any δ ≥ N−2ν and m ≤ Nβ,
we have
P
{ 1

m∑

with a constant C depending on ν and β.
Note that the estimate in this lemma is more precise than (4.10), but the stronger estimate is valid only if
m is not too large. In the proof we will use information about the eigenfunctions obtained in Theorem 4.8.
15
Let
N (k) := N (k)Iη = #{α : λ(k)α ∈ Iη}
denote the number of eigenvalues of the minor B(k) in the interval Iη (see Section 2 for the definitions). By
the interlacing property of the eigenvalues, N ≥MNη implies N (k) ≥MNη − 1 ≥ 12MNη ≥ Nη for any k
(since M ≥ 2 thus MNη ≥ 2). Therefore, from (5.6) we have for any q ≥ 1 that

Proof of Lemma 5.2. We will present the proof under the first condition in (1.2); the proof under the
second condition is analogous. With the notation b =
√
Na, the components of b can thus be written as
bj = xj + iyj where xj , yj are i.i.d. random variables with expectation zero and variance 1/2. Similarly we
decompose the eigenvectors into real and imaginary parts, i.e. we write uα = vα + iwα and we have
ξα = |b · uα|2 =
( N∑
j=1
(xjvα(j) + yjwα(j))

+

The probability and expectation w.r.t. b are denoted by Pb and Eb. We define the event
Ω :=
{
‖uα‖∞ ≤ CN2β−1/2(logN)4 : α = 1, 2, . . . ,m
}
,
where uα are the eigenvectors of B = B

The last two terms come from the Gaussian tail of the restriction |τα|, |sα| ≤ Nβ/2 logN for all α, and
from the probability of the event maxj |xj | + |yj | ≥ Nβ/2 logN . In estimate (5.10) we have used that∣∣∣E[eiY − 1− iY + 12Y 2]∣∣∣ ≤ E|Y 3|, thus for any real random variable Y with EY = 0 and |Y | ≤ 14 we have

6 Proof of the semicircle law on short scales
In this section we prove the semicircle law on the shortest possible scale η ≥ O(1/N).
Proof of Theorem 3.1. We will prove only (3.1), the proof of (3.2) can be obtained from (3.1) exactly
as in Corollary 4.2 of [5]. We can assume that η ≤ (logN)4/N , since the regime η ≥ (logN)4/N has been
covered in Theorem 4.1. At the expenses of increasing the constant C on the r.h.s. of (3.1), we can also
assume that N is sufficiently large. The constants in this proof depend on κ (in addition to δ0, D from (1.3))
and we will not follow their precise dependence. Set z = E + iη. For k = 1, 2, . . . , N define the random
variables

To estimate E|X1(zn)|2p, we will need the following extension of Lemma 4.2 to η ≥ O(1/N).
Lemma 6.1 Let E ∈ [−2+κ, 2−κ]. Suppose that vα and λα are eigenvectors and eigenvalues of an N ×N
random matrix with a law satisfying the assumption of Theorem 4.1. Let
X =
1
N
∑
α
ξα − 1
λα − z
with z = E+iη, ξα = |b ·vα|2, where the components of b are i.i.d. random variables satisfying the condition
C1). Then there exist two positive constants K, C and c (depending on κ) so that for every 0 < δ ≤ 1, we
have
P[|X | ≥ δ] ≤ C e−c min{δ
√
Nη, δ2Nη} (6.12)
if K ≤ Nη ≤ (logN)4.
Proof of Lemma 6.1. We follow the proof of Lemma 4.2 but with the redefined set Ω (see (6.5) instead of
(4.4)). Using the improved bounds from Theorem 5.1 we have already proved in (6.6) that P(Ω) ≤ 3 e−c
√
Nη.
To estimate E
[
1Ωc ·Pb(|X | ≥ δ)
]
, we follow the proof of Proposition 4.3. The only difference is that in (4.6)
the summation runs from n = 0 to n = C logN , but the estimate on the right hand side of (4.6) is still valid.
This completes the proof of Lemma 6.1.
Given the bound (6.12), we have
E|X1(zn)|2p ≤ (Cp
2)p
(Nηn)p
and, from (6.11), we get
E |δ1|2p ≤ (Cp
2)p
(Nηn)p
.
Thus
E
∣∣∣m(zn) + 1
m(zn) + zn
∣∣∣p1(Ξn ∩ Ωc) ≤ (Cp)p
(Nηn)p/2
. (6.13)
For any δ, set the event
Λn(δ) = Λn :=
{∣∣∣m(zn) + 1
m(zn) + zn
∣∣∣ ≥ δ}
then from (6.13)
P(Λn ∩ Ωc) ≤ P(Ξcn ∩ Ωc) +
(Cp)p
(Nηnδ2)p/2
.
We recall the stability of the equation m+ (m + z)−1 = 0, i.e. that there exists a universal constant C
such that ∣∣∣m(z) + 1
m(z) + z
∣∣∣ ≤ δ =⇒ |m(z)−msc(z)| ≤ Cκδ (6.14)
21
with Cκ = Cκ
−1/2, for all δ > 0 and all z with |Re z| ≤ 2−κ, and 0 ≤ Im z ≤ 1. To prove (6.14), we observe
that, from msc + (msc + z)
−1 = 0, and |m+ (m+ z)−1| ≤ δ, it follows that
δ ≥
∣∣∣∣m−msc + 1m+ z − 1msc + z
∣∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣∣(m−msc)(1− 1(m+ z)(msc + z)
)∣∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣∣(m−msc)(1 + mscm+ z
)∣∣∣∣
= |m−msc| |m+msc + z||m+ z|
and thus
|m−msc| ≤ δ|m+ z||m+msc + z| .
Next we observe that there exists a universal constant C such that |msc(z)| ≤ C for all z with |Re z| ≤ 2
and 0 ≤ Im z ≤ 1. Therefore
|m−msc| ≤ δ|m+ z|1(|m+ z| ≥ 2C)|m+ z| − C +
2Cδ
|m+msc + z| ≤ 2δ +
2Cδ
Immsc(z)
where we used the fact that Imm(z) > 0 and Immsc(z) > 0 for all z with Im z > 0. Since
inf
|Re z|≤2−κ,|Im z|≤1
Immsc(z) ≥ c0
2
≥ C√κ (6.15)
for a universal constant C we obtain (6.14) (recall that c0 = π̺sc(E) ≥ C√κ for all |E| ≤ 2− κ).
Choosing δ ≤ c0/10Cκ (which can certainly be satisfied if δ ≤ c1κ for a universal constant c1) and using
again (6.15), we also see that ∣∣∣m+ 1
m+ z
∣∣∣ ≤ δ =⇒ Im m ≥ 2c0/5 . (6.16)
We also know (e.g. from [5])
Im m(zn) ≥ 1
2
Im m(zn+1) .
Thus, on the event Ξcn we have Im m(zn+1) ≤ c0/5, which by (6.16) implies that
Ξcn ⊂ Λn+1
assuming that δ ≤ 4c0/5Cκ.
Thus, we get
P(Λn ∩ Ωc) ≤ P(Λn+1 ∩ Ωc) + (Cp)
p
(2nηNδ2)p/2

Iterating this inequality up to n0, we obtain
P(Λn ∩ Ωc) ≤ P(Λn0 ∩ Ωc) +
n0∑

for sufficiently large N ≥ N0. Thus, combining this with (6.6), for sufficiently small δ, we have

Choosing p = min{1, cδ√Nη} with some small constant c and using the stability bound (6.14), we obtain
Theorem 3.1 for the remaining case of η ≤ (logN)4/N . 2.
Proof of Corollary 3.2. Part (i) follows from (4.14) and (4.15) by noticing that no N2 entropy factor in
(4.15) is needed. In estimating P(NIn ≤ 12c1Nη∗) in (4.15) we infer to the semicircle law (3.2) which now
holds on the O(1/N) scale. Part (ii) follows from part (i) and from

Part (iii) also follows from part (i) after summing up the estimate (3.3) for all spectral intervals and for
all coordinates vj of v by using that the distribution of vj is independent of j.
7 Proof of the tail of the gap distribution
Proof of Theorem 3.3. First notice that for any K0(κ) it is sufficient to prove the theorem for all K ≥ K0(κ),
by adjusting the prefactor C = C(κ) in (3.6). Second, it is sufficient to consider the case of sufficient large
N ≥ N0(κ). By increasing K0(κ) to ensure K0(κ) ≥ N0(κ)2 if necessary, we can estimate
P(λα+1 − E ≥ K/N, α ≤ N − 1) ≤ P(max

√
K − 2) (7.1)
for any K ≥ K0 and N ≤ N0. We recall part i) of Lemma 7.3 of [5], i.e. that there is a constant c > 0 such
that
P{max
β
λβ ≥ L} ≤ e−cL2N (7.2)
for all L ≥ L0 sufficiently large (both c and L0 depend on the constants in (1.3)). Thus the probability in
(7.1) can be estimated by C exp(−c√K).
Next we treat the case K ≥ CN with some large constant C. Since λα+1 ≥ E+K/N implies maxβ λβ ≥
K/N − 2 ≥ L0 for a sufficiently large C, and using (7.2), we obtain much stronger bound of the form
exp(−cK2N) for the tail probability of λα+1. For the rest of the proof we can thus assume that K ≤ CN
and both K and N are sufficiently large, depending on κ.
The event λα+1 ≥ E + K/N implies that there is a gap of size K/N about E′ = E + K/2N . Fix a
sufficiently large M (depending on κ) and let z′ = E′ + iη, with η = K/(NM2) and denote
Nj = #{β : 2j−1K/N ≤ |λβ − E′| ≤ 2jK/N} , j = 0, 1, 2, . . .

P(Ωc) ≤ Ce−c

K .
Then, on the set Ω, we have from (7.3)
Im m(z′) ≤ 16
M
. (7.4)
For large M this implies that |Im m(z′) − Im msc(z′)| ≥ 12 Im msc(z′) =: c0 > 0 and from Theorem 3.1 we
know that

where the constants depend on κ. Thus, recalling that α was defined to be the index of the largest eigenvalue

This proves Theorem 3.3. 2

Let γ be defined so that
λγ − E = min
{
λα − E : λα − E ≥ ε
N
}
,
i.e. λγ is the first eigenvalue above E + ε/N . Thus λγ ≤ λγ+1 ≤ λγ+2 ≤ λγ+3 are the first four eigenvalues
above E+ε/N . If there are no four eigenvalues above E+ε/N , then we use the four consecutive eigenvalues
below E − ε/N , as it will be clear from the proof, what matters is only that the signs of dγ+j , j = 0, 1, 2, 3,
are identical. At the end of the proof we will consider the exceptional case when there are less than four
λ-eigenvalues both above E + ε/N and below E − ε/N , i.e. in this case all but at most six eigenvalues are
in [E − ε/N,E + ε/N ].
We define then
∆ := N(λγ+3 − E). (8.3)
Note that, by definition,
ε ≤ N(λγ − E) ≤ . . . ≤ N(λγ+3 − E) = ∆ ,
in particular dγ ≥ dγ+1 ≥ dγ+2 ≥ dγ+3 (since the function x → x/(x2 + ε2) is decreasing for x ≥ ε) and
cγ ≥ cγ+1 ≥ cγ+2 ≥ cγ+3 thus

Next, we discard, in the first term in the denominator of (8.2), all contributions but the ones from
α = γ, γ + 1. We find
E N 2I ≤ Cε2 E

.
Note that cα and dα depend on the minor B and are independent of the vector b, so we can first take the
expectation value with respect to b. In Lemma 8.2 below we give a general estimate for such expectation
values. Applying (8.11) from Lemma 8.2 with r = p = 2, β1 = γ + 2, β2 = γ + 3, and using the estimates
(8.4), we have
E N 2I ≤ CεE ∆3 .
To estimate the tail probability of ∆, we note that for any K ≥ ε, the event ∆ ≥ K means that there must
be an interval of size (K − ε)/4N between E+ ε/N and E +K/N with no λ-eigenvalue. From Theorem 3.3
we have
P(N λJ = 0) ≤ C e−c
√
N |J|
for any interval J with length |J | ≥ 1/N . Thus
P(∆ ≥ t) ≤ C e−c
√
t, t ≥ 1.
25
Therefore E ∆3 is finite and thus E N 2I ≤ Cε is proven. The other statements in Theorem 3.4 are easy
consequences of this estimate.
Finally, we have to consider the case, when all but at most six λ-eigenvalues are within [E−ε/N,E+ε/N ].
For all these eigenvalues λα we have
1
2ε
−1 ≤ cα ≤ ε−1. If N−1 ≥ 9, then there are at least three eigenvalues
in [E − ε/N,E + ε/N ], we denote them by λγ1 , λγ2 , and λγ3 . Then we have from (8.2) and from (8.13) of
Lemma 8.2 below that
E N 2I ≤ ε2E
(
cγ1ξγ1 + cγ2ξγ2 + cγ3ξγ3
)−2
≤ Cε4 .
This completes the proof for N ≥ 10.
The case N < 10 requires a different argument. Let f be a smooth cutoff function supported on [−1, 1],
0 ≤ f ≤ 1 and f(x) ≡ 1 for |x| ≤ 1/2, and let F (s) = ∫ s−∞ f(x)dx its antiderivative, clearly 0 ≤ F (s) ≤ 2.

where E∗ is the expectation with respect to the off-diagonal matrix elements and E∗∗ is the expectation with

In the last step we used integration by parts, the boundedness of F , the fact that dν˜ is a probability measure
and that

|g˜′(x)| exp(−g˜(x))dx is finite. Thus we obtained the Wegner estimate for the small values of N
as well.
The proof actually shows the following stronger result that will be needed in Section 9. As before, let µ’s
be the eigenvalues of an N ×N Wigner matrix, and let γ = γ(N) defined as
µγ − E = min
{
µα − E : µα − E ≥ ε

}
.

For any positive integer d, let

d = N(µγ(N)+d−1 − E) (8.7)
i.e. the rescaled distance from E to the d-th µ-eigenvalue above E + ε/N . If there are no d µ-eigenvalues
above E + ε/N , then we use the eigenvalues below E − ε/N to define γ = γ(N) as
µγ − E = max
{
µα − E : µα − E ≤ − ε
N
}
and
∆
(µ)
d = N(E − µγ(N)−d+1) . (8.8)
To unify the notation, let us introduce the symbol
∆
(µ)
d =∞ (8.9)
for the extreme case, when there are at most d− 1 eigenvalues above E+ ε/N and at most d− 1 eigenvalues
below E−ε/N ; in particular in this case all but at most 2d−2 eigenvalues are between E−ε/N and E+ε/N .

defined in the λ-spectrum. By the interlacing property and by d ≥ 5, we have
∆ = ∆

Lemma 8.2 Fix p ∈ N/{0} and let N ≥ p + 3. Let u1,u2, . . . ,uN−1 be an arbitrary orthonormal basis
in CN−1 and set ξα = |b · uα|2, where the components of b are i.i.d complex variables with distribution
ν with density h satisfying the condition C2) with an exponent a = p + 3 in (1.4). Fix different indices
α1, . . . , αp, β1, β2 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N−1}. Assume that cj > 0, for j = 1, . . . , p. Let dα ∈ R for all 1 ≤ α ≤ N−1
be arbitrary numbers such that dβ1 , dβ2 > 0. Then, for every 1 < r < p+1, there exists a constant Cr,p <∞
such that

(8.14)
instead of both conditions in (1.4) with exponent a = p+ 3.
Proof. To prove (8.11), we perform a change variables from b = (b1, . . . , bN−1) to z = (z1, . . . zN−1) by
introducing
z = U∗b
where U is the unitary matrix with columns (u1, . . . ,uN−1). Notice that the Jacobian is one, thus

and imaginary parts. We define the function

we used that for the Euclidean norm ‖Ut′‖ = ‖t′‖ = ‖t‖ with t = (t1, . . . tp+2) and similarly ‖Us′‖ = ‖s‖
with s = (s1, . . . , sp+2). Using similar arguments to bound the terms A1 and A2, we conclude that

For each fixed ℓ, the estimate of the expectation value is identical to that of A1 if the density function e
−g for
bℓ is replaced with e
−g∆g (and all other bm, m 6= ℓ, are still distributed according to e−g). Although e−g∆g
is not a probability density, it is only the decay of its Fourier transform that is relevant to proceed similarly
to the estimate (8.26). Having obtained uniform bound on the expectation in (8.28), we can perform the
summation over ℓ and we obtain
Bk ≤ Cp,r(∏p

) r−1

.
Combining this with (8.27) and (8.21), we have proved (8.11).
To prove (8.12), we proceed as before up to (8.21). This time, however, we bound the term A in (8.22),
with r = p, by
A ≤ A4 +A5 +A6 +A7,
where

with c˜ = min(cp−1, cp). We consider first the term A7. We decompose zαj = xj + iyj and zβj = xp+j + iyp+j
into real and imaginary parts. We define the function

The bound for B in (8.22) can be obtained analogously as in the proof of (8.11) (with the same modifications
used for the term A). The proof of (8.13) is similar (but much simpler).
9 Proof of the level repulsion
Proof of Theorem 3.5. We can assume that ε < 1/2 and that k ≥ 2, the k = 1 case was proven in Theorem
3.4. We recall the notation ∆
(µ)
d from (8.7)–(8.9) and we split
P(NI ≥ k) ≤ (I) + (II)
with
(I) :=P(NI ≥ k,∆(µ)d =∞)
(II) :=P(NI ≥ k,∆(µ)d <∞)
(9.1)
for some positive integer d. From the basic formula (2.7) we have

cα =

N2(λα − E)2 + ε2 , dα =
N(λα − E)

as before. Using a moment inequality, we get
(I) ≤ Ckεk2 E 1(∆
(µ)
d =∞)(∑N−1
α=1 cα ξα
)k2 .
This term represents the extreme case, when all but at most 2d− 2 eigenvalues are in [E − ε/N,E + ε/N ].
Choosing d = 2k and assuming that N ≥ k2 + 4k, we see that for at least k2 + 1 different α-indices we have
λα ∈ [E − ε/N,E + ε/N ], i.e. 12ε−1 ≤ cα ≤ ε−1. Using (8.13) with r = k2, p = k2 + 1, we get
(I) ≤ Ckε2k2 . (9.3)
Now we turn to the estimate of (II) and we will consider the following somewhat more general quantity:
IN (M,k, ℓ) := E
[
1(NµI ≥ k) ·
[
∆
(µ)
ℓ
]M · 1(∆(µ)2k−ℓ+4 <∞)]
33
for any M ∈ N and 4 ≤ ℓ ≤ k + 2. The index N refers to the fact that the µ’s are the eigenvalues of an
N ×N Wigner matrix. The superscript µ in NµI indicates that it counts the number of µ-eigenvalues. Since
by definition ∆
(µ)
ℓ ≥ 1, we know that IN (M,k, ℓ) is monotone increasing in M . Moreover, with the choice
M = 0, ℓ = 4 we have
(II) ≤ IN (0, k, 4) . (9.4)
Since the existence of k µ-eigenvalues in the interval I implies that N (j)I ≥ k− 1 for all j = 1, . . . , N (where
N (j)I denotes the number of eigenvalues λ(j)α ∈ I), we obtain that
IN (M,k, ℓ) ≤ Ck εk+1 E

(9.5)
By the interlacing property we have ∆
(λ)
2k−ℓ+3 ≤ ∆(µ)2k−ℓ+4 and ∆(µ)ℓ ≤ ∆(λ)ℓ+1, thus we have
IN (M,k, ℓ) ≤ Ck εk+1 E

(9.7)
To control the first term, we denote by λα1 , . . . , λαk+2 the first k + 2 λ-eigenvalues in the set Iη. Then
cαj ≥ 12ε−1, for all j = 1, . . . , k + 2 and therefore, by (8.13),
A ≤ Ck εk+1E

using that ∆
(λ)
m is monotone increasing in m.
To control the term B in (9.7), we choose the indices α1, . . . , αk−1 so that λαj ∈ Iη for all j = 1, . . . , k−1.
Since we know that there are at most k + 1 eigenvalues in Iη, there must be, either on the right or on the
left of E, λ-eigenvalues at distances larger than ε/N from E if N ≥ k+8. Let us suppose, for example, that
there are four such eigenvalues on the right of E. Then, we define the index αk so that
λαk − E = min
{
λα − E : λα − E > ε
N
}
34
i.e. λαk is the first eigenvalue above E+ ε/N . Moreover, let αk+1 = αk +1, β1 = αk +2 and β2 = αk+1+3.
Recalling the notation (8.7), we set ∆ := ∆
(λ)
4 = N(λβ2 − E). By definition
ε ≤ N(λαk − E) ≤ N(λαk+1 − E) ≤ N(λβ1 − E) ≤ N(λβ2 − E) = ∆.
and min(dβ1 , dβ2) ≥ 12∆ . Therefore

Using (8.12) from Lemma 8.2 (with p = k+1, cj = ε

that

(9.11)
where we used that min(dβ1 , dβ2) ≥ 1/2∆ and that ∆(λ)4 ≤ ∆(λ)ℓ+1.
Together with (9.8) and the monotonicity of IN−1 in M , we obtain that
IN (M,k, ℓ) ≤ Ckε2k−1IN−1(M + 3, k − 1, ℓ+ 1) .
Iterating this inequality, we arrive at
IN (M,k, ℓ) ≤ Ckεk2−1IN−k+1(M + 3(k − 1), 1, ℓ+ k − 1) .
Recalling (9.4), we have
(II) ≤ IN (0, k, 4) ≤ Ckεk2−1IN−k+1(3(k − 1), 1, k + 3) .
Finally, IN−k+1(M, 1, d) was exactly the quantity that has been estimated by Cε for any M and d ≥ 5 in
Corollary 8.1 (replacing N by N − k + 1), thus we have
(II) ≤ Ckεk2 .
Together with (9.3), this completes the proof of Theorem 3.5.

We first consider the case, when the real and imaginary parts of bj are i.i.d. (first condition in (1.2)). We
split ajk and bj into real and imaginary parts, ajk = pjk + iqjk, bj = xj + iyj, and form the vector w =

We apply the non-symmetric version of of the Hanson-Wright theorem [16] for X1 and X2 separately; note
that the components of w are i.i.d. Together with the bound ‖P‖ ≤ √TrP2 we have
P(|X1| ≥ δ) ≤ 2 exp (−cmin{δ/
√
TrP2, δ2/TrP2})
for some constant c depending on δ0 and D from (1.3). Similar estimate holds for X2, so we have
P(|X | ≥ δ) ≤ 4 exp (−cmin{δ/A, δ2/A2})
where A2 =
∑
j,k |ajk|2 =
∑
j,k
[|pjk|2 + |qjk|2].
In the second case in (1.2), when the distribution of the complex random variable bj is rotationally
symmetric, we can directly extend the proof [8] (note that [8] uses the notation Xj for bj). We first
symmetrize the quadratic form X by replacing ajk with
1
2 [ajk + akj ]. We then follow the proof in [8] and
note that the only change is that Z used starting from Lemma 2 in [8] will be a standard complex Gaussian
random variable and instead of Z2 or Z2n we consider |Z|2 = ZZ and |Z|2n, and similarly X2n is replaced
by |X |2n, n = 1, 2, . . .. With these changes, Lemma 1–6 in [8] hold true for the complex case as well. In
the proof of the theorem, starting on page 1082 of [8], instead of
∏
i EX
αi
i (X
2
i − EX2i )βi the expansion will
contain terms of the form
∏
i EX
αi
i X
α′i
i (|Xi|2−E|Xi|2)βi . Due to the rotational symmetry of the distribution,
these terms are all zero (case (i) on page 1082 of [8]) unless αi = α
′
i for all i. In the latter case, the bound
|E|Xi|2αi(|Xi|2 − E|Xi|2)βi | ≤ λ2αi+2βiE|Zi|2αi(|Zi|2 − 1)βi holds with a sufficiently large λ (depending on
δ0 from (1.3)) exactly as in case (ii) on page 1082 of [8]. From now on the proof is unchanged and we obtain
