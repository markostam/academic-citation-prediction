ABSTRACT
The snoRNA-LBME-db is a dedicated database
containing humanC/D box and H/ACA box small nuc-
leolarRNAs (snoRNAs), andsmallCajalbody-specific
RNAs (scaRNAs). C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs
are part of ribonucleoparticles that guide 20-O-ribose
methylation and pseudouridilation, respectively, of
selected residues of 28S, 18S or 5.8S rRNAs or of
the spliceosomal U6 RNA. Similarly, scaRNAs guide
modifications of the spliceosomal RNAs transcribed
byRNApolymerase II (U1, U2, U4, U5 andU12) and are
often composed of both C/D box and H/ACA box
domains. However, some snoRNAs do not function
as modification guide RNAs, but rather as RNA chap-
erones during the maturation of pre-rRNA. The data-
base was built by a compilation of the literature, and
comprises human sno/scaRNAs that were experi-
mentally verified, as well as the human orthologs
of snoRNAs that were cloned in other vertebrate
species, and some snoRNAs that are predicted by
bioinformatics search in loci submitted to genomic
imprinting, but have not all been experimentally
verified. For each entry, the database identifies the
modified nucleotide(s) in the target RNA(s), indicates
the corresponding predicted base pairing, gives a
few pertinent references and provides a link to the
position of the sno/scaRNA on the UCSC Genome
Browser. The ‘Find guide RNA’ function allows one
to find the sno/scaRNAs predicted to guide the
modification of a particular nucleotide in the rRNA
and spliceosomal RNA sequences. The ‘Browse’
function allows one to download the sequences of
selected sno/scaRNAs in the FASTA format. Thedata-
base is available online at http://www-snorna.biotoul.
fr/. It can also be accessed from the human UCSC
Genome Browser via the sno/miRNA track.
INTRODUCTION
Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are 60–150 nt long non-
coding RNAs (but up to 608 nt for yeast snR30) that guide
modifications of selected nucleotides in rRNAs or spliceo-
somal RNAs (1–3). From a structural basis, snoRNAs fall
into two groups (4). The C/D box snoRNAs serve as guides
for the 20-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs or snRNAs and are
characterized by the conserved boxes C (RUGAUGA) and D
(CUGA) and often divergent copies of these boxes, C0 and D0.
They possess 10–21 nt long antisense elements located
upstream of the D and/or D0 boxes, so that the nucleotide
of the target RNA paired with the fifth nucleotide upstream
of the D/D0 box is 20-O-ribose methylated (5,6). The C/D box
snoRNAs are part of sno ribonucleoparticles (snoRNPs) that
also comprise the NOP1/fibrillarin methyltransferase enzyme,
and the NOP56 (NOL5A), NOP58 and NHP2L1 (Snu13, 15.5
kDa) proteins (7,8).
The H/ACA box snoRNAs are guides for the isomerization
of uridine residues into pseudouridine, and are characterized
by two imperfect hairpin structures separated by a single-
stranded hinge containing the H box (ANANNA), and fol-
lowed by a short tail containing the ACA (sometimes AUA,
and AAA for yeast snR44) motif located 3 nt before the
snoRNA 30 end. Two short antisense sequences located in
an internal loop of the 50 and/or 30 hairpin can base pair
upstream and downstream of the targeted, unpaired uridine
that is located 14 or 15 bp upstream of the H and/or ACA box
(9,10). H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with four proteins
including dyskerin (the pseudouridine synthase), NOLA1
(GAR1), NOLA2 (NHP2) and NOLA3 (NOP10).
A new facet of modification guide RNAs appeared with the
discovery of U85, a 330 nt long RNA composed of an H/ACA
box domain embedded in a C/D box domain. Accordingly,
U85 guides both the pseudouridylation of U46 and the 20-O-
ribose methylation of C46 of the U5 spliceosomal RNA (11).
Subsequently, other composite guide RNAs were cloned
and found to share the two characteristics of, first, guiding
modification of snRNAs transcribed by RNA poly-
merase II (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12, but not U6) and, second,

accumulating in the Cajal bodies (12). Such guide RNAs were
thus named small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). In
addition to composite C/D-H/ACA RNAs, scaRNAs can be
composed of two H/ACA domains, or of one or two C/D box
domains.
Rather than guiding RNA modifications, a small number of
C/D box snoRNAs are suspected to act as RNA chaperone
during various steps of pre-rRNA processing, again by a base
pairing mechanism. Moreover, a growing number of both C/D
box and H/ACA box snoRNAs do not display antisense
sequences compatible with a modification guiding function
for rRNAs or snRNAs. These so-called ‘orphan’ snoRNAs
might guide the modification of other classes of RNAs. In
particular, the C/D box snoRNA HBII-52 possesses a perfect
18 nt long complementarity to the 30-untranslated region of the
serotonin receptor 5HT-2c mRNA. Interestingly, the base pre-
dicted to be 20-O-ribose methylated is subjected to A/I RNA
editing.
The vast majority of human sno/scaRNAs are encoded
in introns of so-called host genes, in the sense orientation,
and are produced by exonucleolytic processing of the deb-
ranched intron after splicing. Although many host genes
are related to ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar function,
snoRNA host genes are involved in a variety of biological
function. A growing number of host genes appear to be
devoid of protein coding potential. In addition, a small number
of sno/scaRNAs are produced from independent RNA poly-
merase II transcriptional units. Those include the C/D box
snoRNAs U3, U8 and U13, as well as the recently character-
ized methylation guides mgU2-25/61, mgU2-19/30 and
mgU12-22/U4-8 (13).
AIMS AND CONTENT OF snoRNA-LBME-db
The snoRNA-LBME-db (http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/) was
created to collect the available information on human
snoRNAs and scaRNAs, including their predicted target
nucleotide(s), and the potential base-pairing interactions
with their target RNA(s). This was done by an exhaustive
analysis of the pertinent literature, rather than automatic
extraction from other databases. Indeed, the sequence of many
snoRNAs have not been deposited in databases. Even so, the
database entries give in general no information on the modified
nucleotide and base-pairing interactions with target RNAs.
Moreover, we included in the database the probable orthologs
of several murine sno/scaRNAs sequenced by Huttenhofer
et al. (14) in their extensive RNOmics approach, although
their existence in human has not been always experimentally
established. Special cases are the HBII-52 and HBII-85 C/D
box snoRNA clusters. Their members (47 and 27 for the
HBII-52 and HBII-85 families, respectively) were character-
ized by a bioinformatics search in introns of the large, non-
coding SNURF-SNRNP-UBE3A antisense transcript from the
imprinted locus involved in the Prader-Willi/Angelman syn-
drome. Two other such families of snoRNAs, named 14q(I)
(9 members) and 14q(II) (31 members), were characterized
at another imprinted locus on chromosome 14. Owing to
sequence similarities, it could not be assessed by northern
blot if each individual member of these four families are
expressed. However, all of them are included in the database.
Several snoRNAs are often clustered in different introns of
the same host gene. The examination of conserved sequences
in additional introns of these genes can lead to the discovery of
new snoRNA candidates. This is the case for the C/D box
snoRNA mgh18S-121, which was discovered in an intron
of the RPL23A gene, that hosts the C/D box snoRNAs
U42A and U42B. This new snoRNA is predicited to guide
the 20-O-ribose methylation of U121 of 18S rRNA. As this
nucleoside was experimentally shown to be methylated,
mgh18S-121 was included in the database, although its expres-
sion was not assessed.
With these caveats, all sno/scaRNAs from the database have
been experimentally demonstrated in human, or for some of
them, in the mouse.
To facilitate the identification of sno/scaRNAs genomic
localization and their host gene, each entry of the database
possesses a link to its position in the human UCSC Genome
Browser (15). Moreover, the database can be accessed from
the sno/miRNA track of the UCSC Genome Browser, which
combines human snoRNAs and scaRNAs from the snoRNA-
LBME-db and human miRNAs from the miRBase section of
Rfam (16).
DATABASE DESIGN
The snoRNA-LBME-db home page
The home page gives basic information on sno/scaRNA bio-
logy, including:
(i) the protein composition of the snoRNPs (with links to the
corresponding entries in the GeneLinx and GeneCards
databases);
(ii) the predicted secondary structure of C/D box and H/ACA
box snoRNAs and composite scaRNAs, and base-pairing
interactions with target RNAs;
(iii) information on the RNA component of telomerase, hTR, a
special case of H/ACA box RNA, with appropriate links to
the OMIM database;
(iv) short information on the expression of sno/scaRNAs from
their host gene or from an independent transcriptional unit;
(v) basic information on the relationship between snoRNAs
and genomic imprinting;
(vi) selected reviews in the sno/scaRNA field.
Most importantly, the home page defines the GenBank acces-
sion numbers of the rRNA sequences that were used for num-
bering the modified nucleotides. The various laboratories in
the field used indeed different reference sequences, making it
difficult sometimes to compare their data. The human 18S
rRNA sequence is included in the four GenBank entries
X03205, K03432, M10098 and U13369 (nt 3657–5527),
which differ by few nucleotides. In particular, the sequence
from U13369 contains two extra nucleotides (1641 and 1649)
absent from the three other sequences, as well from the mouse
(X00686) and pig (AY265350 and NR_002170) 18S rRNA
sequences. For a sake of constancy, we adopted the human
X03205 sequence, which is also used by the Small Subunit
rRNA modification Database (17).
The human 5.8S rRNA sequence from GenBank entry
J01866 contains two extra nucleotides (nt 51 and 52)
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Database issue D159
compared with the sequence from U13369 (nt 6623–6779).
Although these 2 nt are also found in some 5.8S rRNA
sequences from mouse (J01871), rat (J01881) and Xenopus
borealis (K01375), the shorter form agrees with many
sequences from different organisms. Therefore, we selected
the 5.8S rRNA sequence from GenBank entry U13369 as the
sequence of reference for our database.
For the human 28S rRNA sequence, we used nt 7935–
12 969 of the U13369 pre-rRNA sequence, rather than the
10 nt shorter M11167 GenBank entry, as the former was
more similar to sequences from other mammalian species.
The search page
The search page allows one to find a sno/scaRNA by typing its
name from the literature (e.g. U85, ACA17, mgU12-22/U4-8,
Z32 and E2). The RNAs can be also searched by incomplete
names, such as mg and HBII-. When a snoRNA has been given
alternative names by different laboratories (such as E1 and
U17A, U39 and U55), the user is directed to a common entry,
so that the database is non-redundant. The only exception
concerns the scaRNAs mgU12-22/U4-8 and U91, as the latter
corresponds to the 30 half of the former. As these two RNAs
were cloned separately, and appear to have distinct subnuclear

localizations, they constitute two separate entries. The human
orthologs of mouse snoRNAs cloned by Huttenhoffer et al.
(14) were named by changing MBI- and MBII- to HBI- and
HBII-, respectively.
RNAs can also be searched by length, GenBank acces-
sion number or target RNA. Typing 28S in the ‘Target
RNA’ window will give a list of 28S rRNA modification
guides. Typing ‘no’ gives the list of orphan snoRNAs without
documented or predicted target RNA.
The sno/scaRNA pages
The database contains a total of 361 entries: 257 C/D box
snoRNAs [149 by counting only one example of each of
the 14q(I) (9 members), 14q(II) (31 members), HBII-85
(27 members) and HBII-52 (47 members) clusters], 86 H/
ACA snoRNAs and 18 scaRNAs. Among those, 114 have
no documented target RNA. The number of these so-
called orphan snoRNAs reduces to 40 when counting 1 per
cluster.
As an example, the page corresponding to U85 scaRNA is
reproduced on Figure 1.
The individual pages for snoRNAs or scaRNAs give the
following information:
(i) the most common name from the literature.
(ii) the length of the RNA.
(iii) an abstract that gives information on the manner the RNA
was characterized, its predicted function (RNA modifi-
cation guide, RNA chaperone and orphan RNA), with
pertinent references. Other sno/scaRNAs with the
same host gene are listed.
(iv) a drawing that indicates the predicted base pairing with
the target RNA(s). This is unique among other vertebrate
non-coding RNA databases.
(v) the GenBank accession number, with a hyperlink to
GenBank.
(vi) information on the host gene. Generally, genes are
designated by the acronym used by the UCSC Genome
Browser.
(vii) a hyperlink to the UCSC Genome Browser that will direct
to the position of the sno/scaRNA gene in the human
genome.
(viii) information on the target RNA(s) and nucleotide(s).
(ix) pertinent references with hyperlinks to PubMed.
(x) the sequence in the FASTA format.
The ‘Find guide RNA’ pages
Individual pages for the 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs, and the U1,
U2, U4, U5, U6 and U12 snRNAs allow one to find sno/
scaRNAs, if any, which are predicted to guide the modification
of a particular nucleotide in these ARNs. One can thus see, for
example, that pseudouridylation of 28S rRNA U4523 is pre-
dicted to be guided by both H/ACA box snoRNAs ACA7 and
HBI-6. Pointing a nucleotide for a few seconds will display its
numbering in the target RNA sequence. Clicking on the sno/
scaRNA name will direct to the corresponding entry.
The Browse page
This page allows one to select sno/scaRNAs and get their
sequence in the FASTA format. Pressing the ‘Toggle all’
allows to retrieve all sequences from the database. Clicking
on the sno/scaRNA name will direct to the corresponding page.
Accessing the snoRNA-LBME-db from the UCSC
Genome Browser
The snoRNAs and scaRNAs from the snoRNA-LBME-db
were aligned against the human genome using BLAT (18)
on the public USCS Genome Browser server. In a few
cases, no exact match was found for the published sequence.
In these cases, which probably correspond to sequencing
errors, we adopted the best BLAT hit, which differed from
the published sno/scaRNA sequence by 1–3 nt. The BLAT
results were used to write a track named sno/miRNA that
combines the sno/scaRNAs from the snoRNA-LBME-db,
and miRNAs from miRBase (16). The C/D box snoRNAs,
H/ACA snoRNAs, scaRNAs and miRNAs are indicated by
different colors (Figure 2). Clicking on the name of a particular
Figure 2. Sample of snoRNA annotation on the human UCSC Genome Browser. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are colored dark gray and light gray, respectively;
and scaRNAs, white (not shown). In the case of the cluster shown, the examination of the Hu/Chimp/Mouse/Rat/Dog/Chick/Fugu/Zfish Multiz Alignment &
Conservation track reveals that sequences corresponding to snoRNAs are more conserved than those of the exons of the putative host gene.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Database issue D161
RNA directs one to the corresponding entry in the pertinent
database, snoRNA-LBME-db or miRBase.
The sno/miRNA track allows one to visualize the position of
a sno/scaRNA or a miRNA relative to other annotations [e.g.
RefSeq genes, mRNAs and expressed sequence tags (ESTs)].
Moreover, the use of the sno/miRNA table in the ‘Genes and
Gene Prediction Tracks’ allows one to answer many questions,
such as the identity of sno/miRNAs that intersect with an EST
in the entire genome or at a particular chromosome interval.
Future developments
The present nomenclature for sno/scaRNAs does not follow a
general logic. Various names were given by different labor-
atories, such as En, Un, ACAn, Zn, HBII-n, HBI-n, 14q(I-n),
snRn and mgU6-n (where n is an integer). Most of such names
do not give any hint on the corresponding structural and func-
tional family of the snoRNA. A name like mgU6-53 indicates
that the snoRNA is predicted to guide the 20-O-ribose methyla-
tion of nucleoside 53 of the U6 snRNA. Although logical, this
nomenclature becomes complicated when a snoRNA (e.g.
mgU12-22/U4-8) guides modifications in different RNAs
and appears difficult to extend to scaRNAs (e.g. U85),
which guide both a methylation and a pseudouridylation.
We thus hope that the setting up of this database will provide
the scientific community with an opportunity to adopt an
unified nomenclature for sno/scaRNAs. In that case, newly
discovered sno/scaRNAs might be submitted to the
snoRNA-LBME-db to be attributed a consensus name.
This database is for the moment restricted to human. It
would be useful to extend it to mouse by both collecting
the published sequences and searching for mouse orthologs
of human sno/scaRNAs. Moreover, we plan to build tables
linking the human modification sites and snoRNAs with their
homologs in other species like Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
