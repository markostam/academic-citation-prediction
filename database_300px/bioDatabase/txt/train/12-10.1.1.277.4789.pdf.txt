ABSTRACT
RNA splicing is an essential step in gene expression,
and is often variable, giving rise to multiple alternat-
10 ivelysplicedmRNAandprotein isoformsfromasingle
gene locus. The design of effective databases to sup-
port experimental and computational investigations
of alternative splicing (AS) is a significant challenge.
In an effort to integrate accurate exon and splice site
15 annotation with current knowledge about splicing
regulatory elements and predicted AS events, and
to link information about the splicing of orthologous
genes in different species, we have developed the
HOLLYWOOD system. This database was built upon
20 genomic annotation of splicing patterns of known
genesderived fromsplicedalignmentofcomplement-
ary DNAs (cDNAs) and expressed sequence tags,
and links features such as splice site sequence and
strength, exonic splicing enhancers and silencers,
25 conserved and non-conserved patterns of splicing,
and cDNA library information for inferred alternative
exons. HOLLYWOOD was implemented as a relational
database and currently contains comprehensive
information for human and mouse. It is accompanied
30 by a web query tool that allows searches for sets
of exons with specific splicing characteristics or
splicing regulatory element composition, or gives
a graphical or sequence-level summary of splicing
patterns for a specific gene. A streamlined graphical
35 representation of gene splicing patterns is provided,
and these patterns can alternatively be layered onto
existing information in the UCSC Genome Browser.
The database is accessible at http://hollywood.

40INTRODUCTION
Gene expression is controlled at several levels, and in meta-
zoan genomes, where the majority of protein-coding genes
contain introns, the splicing of precursors to mRNAs (pre-
mRNAs) constitutes a critical step for regulation of gene
45expression (1–3). RNA splicing occurs in the nucleus and is
catalyzed by a large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex known
as the spliceosome, which is composed of several small nuc-
lear RNPs and over one hundred proteins (4). The processing
of pre- mRNAs is often variable, giving rise to multiple altern-
50atively spliced mRNAs, which may serve to produce distinct
protein isoforms (5–7). Typical mammalian gene loci span
tens of thousands of nucleotides (nt), with an average of
nine exons/eight introns and the coding region typically span-
ning 1500 nt (8–10). In addition to the precise recognition of
55splice sites among many possible pseudo-sites, the removal of
introns and the production of the correct message, the
spliceosome must also produce tissue- and developmental
stage-specific mRNA isoforms and integrate RNA splicing
decisions with other steps in RNA processing, such as capping,
60cleavage and polyadenylation (11,12). Correct pre-mRNA
splicing is generally required for cell viability. At least
15% of point mutations that cause genetic defects do so by
altering splice site sequences (13), and the misregulation of
alternative splicing (AS) is associated with a number of human
65diseases (14–17).
Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is estimated to affect
more than half of actively transcribed human genes (18),
and the systematic identification of AS events is important
for the fundamental understanding of the regulation of gene
70expression in development, differentiation and human disease
(19,20). A number of AS databases have been constructed,
based on either searches of the scientific literature (21–23) or
automated large-scale comparisons of transcript and genomic
sequences (see below). The latter approach is made possible
75by the availability of large repositories of complementary

DNA (cDNA) sequences and expressed sequence tags (ESTs),
derived from different tissues or cell lines. Available data
enable large-scale computational analysis of AS in human
and mouse, and a few other organisms, with an average of
5 >200 transcripts available for each annotated human gene (24).
Transcript-based AS databases include: the Alternative
Splicing Database Project, ASAP (25), the Alternative
Splicing Database, ASD (26), the Extended Alternatively
Spliced EST Database, EASED (27), SPLICEINFO (28)
10 and ECGENE (29), to name a few (18,30) (http://
hollywood.mit.edu/db/). Bioinformatics studies relying on
such databases have proven useful in revealing differences
in AS patterns between tissues (31–33), in identifying con-
served AS events in orthologous genes (34–38), and for
15 describing disease-associated AS (39). However, the AS
events recorded differ significantly between different data-
bases, owing to differences in primary sequence data used,
in the algorithms used to generate spliced alignments, and in
the stringency of alignment quality filtering.
20 More recently, splicing-sensitive microarrays have been
designed and used for the detailed analysis of tissue-
specific and other types of AS (40–45), and a cross-linking/
immunoprecipitation strategy has been introduced for the sys-
tematic identification of RNAs bound by a given splicing
25 factor (46). These newly developed methods set a direction
toward increasingly parallel experimental analysis of splicing
regulation, and AS databases will become increasingly import-
ant in both experimental design and data analysis for these
types of functional genomic approaches.
30 To aid in computational and large-scale experimental stud-
ies of AS, we developed HOLLYWOOD, a comparative relational
database of AS. HOLLYWOOD integrates accurate exon and
splice site annotation derived from spliced alignments of tran-
scripts to genomic sequences with current knowledge about
35 splicing regulatory elements and predicted AS events, and
links information about the splicing of orthologous genes in
different species to facilitate comparative analyses. A compact
representation of the splicing pattern of any desired gene is
provided, and sets of alternative or constitutive exons can be
40 obtained using complex queries for features such as splice site
strength, type of AS event, tissue expression, splicing regu-
latory element content or conservation of the AS event
between human and mouse.
HOLLYWOOD DATABASE
45 The design and implementation of HOLLYWOOD followed cer-
tain guiding principles: (i) all exon and isoform data should
derive from high-quality spliced alignment of transcripts to
genome sequences; (ii) AS events should be identified without
requiring designation of an arbitrary ‘reference’ transcript;
50 (iii) current knowledge about splice sites, splicing regulatory
elements and predicted AS events should be incorporated into
the database to allow efficient searches; (iv) the database
should be integrated with other widely-used databases and
genome browsers when possible; and (v) two main types of
55 queries should be supported—queries for splicing information
about a particular gene or genes and queries for sets of exons
with particular properties. Examples of the output format for
each of these types of queries are shown in Figure 1A for
a gene query for the human fragile X mental retardation
60syndrome-related (FXR1) gene, and in Figure 1B for an
exon query yielding exon 16 of the FXR1 gene.
HOLLYWOOD incorporates current knowledge about splice
sites and splicing regulatory elements. It uses both a standard
position-specific weight matrix model as well as a sophistic-
65ated maximum entropy-based model for the quantification of
30 and 50 splice site (30ss and 50ss) strength; the latter has been
shown to more accurately distinguish authentic and pseudo
splice sites (47,48). In addition to classical 30ss and 50ss motifs,
it is now well established that other cis-regulatory elements
70including exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and silencers
(ESSs) play common and important roles in exon and
splice site choice (49). HOLLYWOOD annotates exons with
sets of candidate ESE and ESS elements that have been
identified in recent computational and experimental screens
75(50,51). The database also incorporates information about
‘alternative-conserved exons’ (ACEs)—orthologous exon
pairs whose alternative splicing is conserved between
human and mouse—from two sources: 450 exons with
transcript evidence of AS in both species are annotated, as
80well as 2000 candidate ACEs predicted by the ACESCAN
algorithm (35).
Primary data
In building the HOLLYWOOD system, five major data sources
were used, all of which are publicly available: (i) Ensembl
85gene chromosomal locations and gene identifiers (52), corres-
ponding to genome assemblies from GoldenPath version hg16
of the human and version mm3 of the mouse genome (http://
genome.ucsc.edu); (ii) transcript sequences from GenBank
release 139.0, including the repositories gbpri, gbrod and
90gbhtc; (iii) EST sequences from dbEST, release 01122004,
totaling 5.4 million human and 4.5 million mouse ESTs
[dbEST records were grouped into one of about 40 human or
mouse primary tissue types according to their cDNA library
information, as described previously (32)]; (iv) mammalian
95interspersed repeat sequences from the RepBase repository
(53); and (v) sets of ESEs and ESSs from the RESCUE-
ESE and FAS-hex2 datasets, respectively (50,51).
Exon and feature annotation
Genomic sequences were extracted spanning an Ensembl gene
100from the start to the end of the annotation, plus an addi-
tional 5000 nt upstream and downstream of the start and
end, respectively; these sequences are referred to as gene
‘slices’. The set of slices for all Ensembl genes was obtained
from EnsMart (54). Use of the Ensembl gene annotation to
105define gene slices enables use of standard gene names and
identifiers and enables linking to external databases. However,
beyond the definition of slice boundaries, Ensembl annotation
is not explicitly used in HOLLYWOOD: all exon/intron annota-
tion and splicing information derives directly from transcript
110alignments. For convenience, HOLLYWOOD generally uses
gene slice-based coordinates, which are converted to global
chromosomal coordinates as needed.
Large-scale spliced alignments of transcript sequences to
genomic DNA are conducted using the genome annotation
115system GENOA (http://genes.mit.edu/genoa), which will be des-
cribed in greater detail elsewhere. Briefly, GENOA detects stat-
istically significant blocks of identity between repeat-filtered
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Database issue D57
cDNA sequences and gene slices, then conducts spliced align-
ments of best-matched cDNAs to corresponding gene loci
using the algorithm MRNAVSGEN. To avoid problems attend-
ant to automated annotation of genomic regions, which are
5 subject to frequent rearrangement such as immunoglobulin
loci, cDNAs from certain classes of immune-related genes
are optionally excluded by GENOA. Statistically significant
matches are then identified between EST sequences
and aligned repeat-filtered cDNAs, and best-matched ESTs
10are aligned to the corresponding gene slices using the SIM4
algorithm (55). GENOA was applied with stringent alignment
criteria, requiring a sequence identity above 93% for cDNA

B
D58 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Database issue
alignments. For ESTs, the first and last aligned segments were
required to be at least 30 nt long, with a sequence identity of at
least 90%, and the entire alignment was required to have a
sequence identity of at least 90%, over at least 90% of EST
5 nucleotides. Using 22 200 human and 25 000 mouse gene
slices, these alignments criteria were passed by 79 000 out of
115 000 human cDNAs for 19 300 gene slices, and by
roughly one-fifth out of 5.4 million human ESTs, highlighting
the stringency of the applied quality filter. The same alignment
10 criteria were passed by only 27 000 out of 102 000 mouse
cDNAs for 13 500 gene slices, while roughly one-fifth out
of 4.1 million mouse ESTs met these criteria. GENOA aligned
2–4% of ESTs and 1% of cDNAs to multiple loci on
different chromosomes.
15 The annotation of exons as constitutive or alternative is
made by the program runHOLLYWOOD, which implements a
set of computational rules to identify splice types of alternative
exons (to be described elsewhere). HOLLYWOOD annotates
constitutive exons, skipped exons, mutually exclusive exons,
20 alternative 30ss and/or 50ss exons and retained introns.
By default, every exon is labeled as ‘constitutive’ and this
label remains unless specific criteria are met for annotation
as another alternative. Figure 2 shows for the human and
mouse genome the numbers of annotated constitutive and
25 alternative exons, together with a pictorial representation of
the criteria required for identifying each of these alternative
exon types. This annotation is not restricted to one splice type
per exon, but allows for exons to be included in multiple
categories, e.g. an exon may exhibit both skipping and
30 alternative 50ss usage.
Data model and implementation as a relational database
The HOLLYWOOD system consists of a generalized alignment
parser framework, a relational database and a web interface.
HOLLYWOOD defines a relational data model that distinguishes
35 three primary tables—‘exon’, ‘gene’ and ‘transcript’—such
that updated or new information can be represented in a
structure consistent with existing data. A generalized parsing
module simplifies the process of incorporating information,
which is provided in flat file format. The parser currently
40 inserts data into the PostgreSQL relational database manage-
ment system, but could in principle support various database
back ends. The structured query language (SQL) provides
the ability to perform a wide range of powerful queries.
HOLLYWOOD can also be queried through a web interface
45 (Figure 3), with which users can build queries without
knowledge of SQL. This interface allows users to retrieve
sets of exons or transcripts that satisfy constraints defined
on any number of supported features. Data are output in
flat file or XML-based formats for downstream bioinformatic
50analysis.
A primary design goal was to ease the process of importing
new data, and to this end HOLLYWOOD utilizes Perl packages
that hide database implementation details. The parser interacts
with the relational database backend, and the data model is
55optimized for efficient storage and data retrieval. Proper
normalization techniques are employed in HOLLYWOOD,
which facilitate the removal of redundant information and
contribute to the logical organization of the data model, and
the primary exon, gene and transcript data were decoupled
60in order to minimize the number of tables that have to be
reloaded when a single input file is updated. For instance,
for an update of gene names/descriptions one only needs to
reload the corresponding table, and without further depend-
encies, the rest of the database remains unaffected.
65HOLLYWOOD web interface and example applications
The HOLLYWOOD system is accessible at http://hollywood.mit.
edu. Human and mouse gene slices, comprising roughly one-
third of the human or mouse genome, are available for down-
load and organized by chromosomes. Gene locus-based (local)
70coordinates are provided in 50–30 direction corresponding
to the transcriptional orientation of the gene in each slice;
corresponding chromosome-based (global) coordinates are
also provided.
Retrieval of exon sequences and features
75A feature-selection form allows the user of HOLLYWOOD to
extract sets of constitutive and/or alternative exons, either for a
single gene, specified by its Ensembl gene identifier or name,
or for genes that share similar descriptions (e.g. kinases).
The user can select exon features such as internal, constitutive
80or alternative (e.g. skipped), inclusion in transcripts derived
from a particular tissue, conservation or presence of a
particular ESE hexamer (e.g. GAAGAA). After the user
has selected the features and submitted the form, exon
records that meet the criteria are retrieved from the
85database. Figure 1A shows the data structure of such a
record for exon E16 of the FXR1 gene, which undergoes
tissue-specific AS (32,56).
As an example, a query with feature selection ‘hnRNP’ for
gene description, ‘Skipped exon’ for splice type, and ‘Internal’
90for exon position retrieved 40 human exons, including
skipped exons in genes encoding hnRNP A1, hnRNP C and
hnRNP R. A second query for exons with features ‘Internal’,
‘Skipped exon’, ‘Testis’ for tissue type and ‘TTCCTT’ for ESS
Figure 1. (A) Screen shot of the HOLLYWOOD graphical interface summarizing splicing patterns for a single gene. The top of the interface summarizes species, locus,
Ensembl-linked gene number and name, gene description, and EST-derived tissue types with corresponding number of occurrences. The annotation performed by
HOLLYWOOD is complemented by ACESCAN-predicted splice-conservation and exons that were annotated by Ensembl. Color-coded boxes are used to link display
features with explanatory information. For each alternative exon splice type, HOLLYWOOD displays GenBank-linked accession numbers and primary transcript
structures of representative pairs of transcripts, which can be used to identify the alternative exons, and layers each structure onto the UCSC Genome Browser.
(B) HOLLYWOOD exon record for skipped exon E16 identified in the human fragile X mental retardation syndrome-related (FXR1) gene. FXR1 is an autosomal
homolog of the FXR gene and encodes an RNA-binding protein. Figure 1 shows data for exon E16, by searching HOLLYWOOD with ‘FXR1’ for gene name and
‘Skipping’ for exon type, with a schematic representation of features at top and the standard text output below. FXR1 is shown with two isoforms that alternatively
skip/include E16. Skipping of E16 results in a shift of the reading-frame that is predicted to alter and shorten the C-terminus of the FXR1 protein. E16 is an
ACESCAN[+] exon with a score of0.2, and hence the orthologous exon of the mouseFXR1 is predicted to undergo exon skipping. This exon is perfectly conserved in
sequence and contains two clusters of RESCUE-ESE hexamers. Transcripts aligned to the locus of FXR1 show E16 included in more than a dozen transcripts (two
cDNAs AY341428 and HSU25165, and >10 ESTs) and excluded in 30 other transcripts (cDNA BC028983 and other ESTs), and ESTs suggest that FXR1 is
expressed in many tissues.

sequence element retrieved 160 skipped human exons,
which included the sperm-specific thioredoxin 2 (Sptrx) gene
and the gene encoding the spermatogenesis cell apoptosis-
related protein 1. A third query for exons with features
5 ‘Internal’, ‘Constitutive exon’ and positive ACESCAN scores
(orthologous exon pairs predicted to be alternatively spliced in
both human and mouse). The HOLLYWOOD system retrieved
1400 ACEs, including exon 5 of the tissue-specific RNA-
binding protein NOVA-1, which has recently been identified
10 as a skipped exon that is auto-regulated by NOVA-1 (57). As a
final example, HOLLYWOOD was queried first with the feature
selection ‘Skipped exon’ for splice type, ‘Brain’ and ‘GAA-
GAA’ for ESE sequence element, and was then queried with
‘GGTAAG’ for ESS sequence element, keeping the remaining
15features as selected previously. It retrieved 470 exon records
for the first query, and 50 exon records for the latter query.
These examples anticipate some of the types of analysis of
alternative exons and functional sequence elements that can
be conducted using HOLLYWOOD.
20Viewing AS patterns
In addition to specific sets of exons, queried for by employing
the feature selection form, HOLLYWOOD allows the user to
display a summary of the splicing information contained in
the database for one gene at a time. The user simply queries for
Figure 3. Web interface offering two feature-selection forms for searches for sets of exons with specific splicing characteristics or splicing regulatory element
composition (left), or for the splicing picture for a specific gene (right). Each feature is linked to the online documentation with explanatory information about feature
utilization, values or nomenclature. Ensembl gene identifiers are most reliable for querying, as gene names are often not standardized, and response time is typically
within seconds, depending on the complexity of the query.
Figure 2. Tree representation of numbers of human (left) and mouse (right) alternative and constitutive exons in HOLLYWOOD. All exons are supported by spliced
alignments of transcript sequences with minimal acceptor and donor splice sites AG/ and /GT or /GC, respectively. Splice sites required to identify constitutive
and alternative exons are marked bolded in black. HOLLYWOOD branches its annotation as follows: (i) on the first level, it distinguishes between first, internal and
last exons; (ii) on the next level, it distinguishes between constitutive exons, with constant 30ss and 50ss, and alternative exons, with varying 30 and/or 50ss; (iii)
on the last level, alternative exons are annotated as skipped, alternative 30ss, alternative 50ss, overlapping, or mutually exclusive exons. In addition, introns
that are retained in mature mRNA are annotated as intron retention events. Alternative exons may undergo multiple splice variations and can belong to multiple
branches.

a specific gene by name or by Ensembl identifier, and selects
the display option. Alternatively, one may obtain a sequence-
based representation of the display, and download all tran-
scripts mapped to the gene locus.
5 After a gene is selected, a diagram illustrating splicing
patterns is computed in real-time and displayed. Such a display
for the human FXR1 gene is shown in Figure 1A, supported by
legends. The HOLLYWOOD annotation is presented as a set of
evaluated reference exons, each of unit size and color-coded as
10 first, internal or last exon, with internal exons further annotated
according to their splicing properties as constitutive or altern-
ative. The HOLLYWOOD annotation shown derives from exons
supported by spliced alignments with minimal consensus 30ss
and 50ss sequences (AG/ and /GT or /GC, respectively). For
15 clarity, the first and last segments of EST alignments (which
generally correspond to incomplete portions of exons) are not
displayed. Similarly, first and last exons are clustered and
represented as first/last ‘exon regions’ to simplify the diagrams
and focus attention on splicing-related (rather than transcrip-
20 tion- or polyadenylation-related) information. HOLLYWOOD
does not display all obtained spliced alignments (which
often number in the hundreds or more), but provides a
streamlined representation, displaying pairs of ‘representative
transcripts’, which support the inference of each AS event.
25 Finally, the HOLLYWOOD display can conveniently be
layered onto the UCSC Genome Browser, by using custom
tracks that are provided as links on the display, for detailed
comparisons with other existing annotations and inspection of
multi-species sequence conservation.
30 HOLLYWOOD MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
The first-phase development of HOLLYWOOD has matured
such that the public release 1.0 can serve as a central resource
for data and graphical display of patterns of alternative
pre-mRNA splicing. Updates, improvements and further
35 developments will be ongoing, and are currently envisioned
as extensions for comparative genomics, perhaps with layering
onto the Ensembl Genome Browser, integration of external
annotations and incorporation of splicing-specific microarray
data with links to exon records.
