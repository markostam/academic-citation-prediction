Abstract
The aims of the present study were to investigate
(1) the proportion of adolescents in each of the
stages of change, (2) the differences in psychoso-
cial factors and in physical activity between the
stages, and (3) the classification accuracy using
several reference criteria. A random sample of
38 schools from the Flemish community in
Belgium resulted in a sample of 5931 adolescents
(mean age 5 14.8, range 12–18, 61% females).
All adolescents completed a computerized ques-
tionnaire assessing demographic variables,
physical activity, physical activity determinants
and stages of change. Distribution across the
stages was: precontemplation, n5 684 (11.5%);
contemplation, n 5 948 (16.0%); preparation,
n 5 818 (13.8%); action, n 5 492 (8.3%); and
maintenance, n 5 2989 (50.4%). Analyses re-
vealed gender and age differences (P < 0.001),
with girls and older adolescents being more
prevalent in the first three stages. Differences
between the stages of change were related to
higher levels of physical activity of different
intensity and within different contexts (P <
0.001), together with more favorable psychoso-
cial determinants related to physical activity (P<
0.001). No differences between stages were found
for sedentary activities. Three subgroups of
adolescents were identified based on psychoso-
cial determinants and physical activity levels.
About 71% of the adolescents placed themselves
in a stage which was in accordance with their
self-reported level of physical activity.
Introduction
Health benefits of regular physical activity are well
documented in all age groups (Bouchard et al.,
1994). Nevertheless, a sedentary lifestyle among
adolescents, adults and older persons is prevalent in
almost all parts of the Western world (Caspersen
et al., 1994; Steptoe et al., 1997). There is a clear
age gradient throughout the lifespan. In particular,
a steep decline in activity levels occurs in adoles-
cence (Sallis, 2000). Furthermore, tracking studies
have revealed that low levels of physical activity
remain stable from adolescence into adulthood
(Malina, 1996; Lefevre et al., 2000), especially in
females (De Bourdeaudhuij et al., 2002). Therefore,
adolescents seem to be an important group to
promote the maintenance of adequate physical
activity levels or to encourage inactive adolescents
to become more active.
It is obvious that interventions to promote phys-
ical activity have to be based upon itsmost important
processes or determinants in that population. Based
on generic theories or models (Ajzen and Madden,
1986; Bandura, 1986), physical activity in adoles-
cence was best predicted by self-efficacy, attitudes
or beliefs, family or friend support, and perceived
benefits and barriers (De Bourdeaudhuij, 1998;
Sallis et al., 2000). The Transtheoretical Model

(Prochaska and DiClemente, 1983) has also been
proposed as a useful framework to understand the
adoption and maintenance of exercise behavior [for
review, see (Marshall and Biddle, 2001)]. A major
contribution of the Transtheoretical Model is that it
matches the determinants of the generic psychoso-
cial models with the readiness of the individual to
change behavior and that it also provides guidelines
for designing interventions. Research has shown
that the role of attitudes, social influence, self-
efficacy, and perceived benefits and barriers in
changing behavior differs depending upon the par-
ticular stage (Prochaska et al., 1994; De Vries and
Mudde, 1998; Marshall and Biddle, 2001; Ronda
et al., 2001).
Until now the Transtheoretical Model has not
been extensively investigated in the context of
physical activity in adolescence. An application is
not straightforward, as some problems may arise.
First, the level of physical activity in adolescence is
higher than during adulthood. There may be few
adolescents in the precontemplation and contem-
plation stages, resulting in a low statistical power
(Nigg and Courneya, 1998; Hausenblas et al.,
2002). Second, a core feature in the Transtheoret-
ical Model is its time perspective. It is unknown
whether this time perspective also applies in chil-
dren and adolescents. Finally, it is not known
whether adolescents are able to adequately evaluate
their own level of physical activity. Awareness of
their own (in)activity is necessary not only to
categorize themselves in the correct stage (precon-
templation, contemplation and preparation, i.e. not
meeting the reference criteria, versus action and
maintenance, i.e. meeting the reference criteria), but
also to perceive a need to change.
The present study is the first to investigate the
stages of change of physical activity in a large
representative sample of adolescents within a broad
age range (12–18 years). Previous studies have used
smaller and selective samples (Cardinal et al., 1998;
Nigg and Courneya, 1998; Walton et al., 1999;
Hausenblas et al., 2002). This often resulted in the
merging of stages which hindered a specific and
detailed analysis of the stages of change (Marshall
and Biddle, 2001). The present study focused upon
three issues. First, the proportion of adolescents in
each of the stages of change is determined. Second,
differences in psychosocial factors and in physical
activity across the stages of change are investigated.
Third, correct classification, misclassification, sen-
sitivity and specificity of the stages of change for
physical activity in adolescents were evaluated
against two reference criteria.
Methods
Participants
Adolescents were recruited from secondary schools
randomly selected throughout the Flemish commu-
nity in Belgium. Thirty-eight schools participated
with a total of 6117 adolescents. Schools were
representative with respect to geographic region,
school system (catholic, governmental, provincial
and city) and educational system (general, technical
and vocational). The study was approved by the
different educational authorities and by the Ethical
Committee of the University Hospital of Ghent
University. Of the 6117 participants, 186 (3%) were
excluded because they did not answer the question
about the stages of change, resulting in a sample of
5931 adolescents. The mean age was 14.8 (SD =
1.9), ranging from 12 to 18 years old. Sixty-one
percent of the participants were girls. Every ado-
lescent present completed a computerized question-
naire in the computer class at school. Data were
collected through the intranet of the school. Ques-
tionnaire software was loaded from a CD-ROM
onto the school computer server.
Measures
Physical activity
A questionnaire was developed to assess the levels
of physical activity in diverse domains, such as
school activity, transportation, leisure time activity
and sedentary activities. Sport participation was
assessed by asking adolescents to select their three
most important sports out of a list of 178 sports. For
each of these three sports, they reported frequency
(from once a year to more than once a day) and
duration (from some hours per year to more than

20 hours per week). A sport participation index
was computed by summing hours per week spent in
these three sports. Sport at school except Physical
Education (PE) was assessed by asking participants
the extent of sport or physically activity during
noon break, during and after study hours after
school, at Wednesday afternoon (a ‘free’ afternoon
in Belgian schools), or at class or school tourna-
ments. Participants reported whether they partici-
pated and how much time they spent in these
activities. A sport at school except PE index was
calculated by summation of the time spent in these
activities. Active transportation was assessed by
asking for walking and cycling to school, and for
transportation in leisure time. Two different indices
were computed: walking or cycling to school index
and walking or cycling in leisure time index. A
voluntary physical activity index was composed by
summing up the four indexes mentioned above. A
total physical activity index was provided by add-
ing PE to the voluntary physical activity index. The
Government Education Policy for PE in Belgian
schools is a minimum of 2 hours obligatory PE for
all students.
Two questions were included asking for the
number of times per week that participants engaged
in vigorous activity for at least 20 minutes and for
the number of days per week that participants
engaged in continuous moderate activity for 60
minutes. Physical inactivity was assessed asking for
hours per day that participants watched television or
video, or played computer games during a week day
and during a weekend day. All activity indexes
were expressed in hours per week; the sedentary
index in hours per day.
This computer-assisted questionnaire has a good
reliability and an acceptable validity (Philippaerts
et al., 2003). Intra-class correlation coefficients
(reliability) varied between 0.64 and 0.91 (P <
0.01), with the lowest coefficient for energy expend-
iture during leisure time transport. Pearson correl-
ation coefficients with mean counts and the time
spent in activities of different intensities (light,
moderate, hard and very hard) from CSA acceler-
ometers (validity) were significant for all activity
measures (r = 0.41–0.79, P < 0.05).
Physical activity determinants
General-affective attitude, social influences, self-
efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers were as-
sessed by 21 items with a five-point scale. Questions
were selected and adopted from previous studies
with adolescents and adults (De Bourdeaudhuij and
Sallis, 2002). General-affective attitudes towards
physical activity were assessed using bipolar adjec-
tives. Participants were asked whether sports and
physical activity are ‘not pleasant – pleasant’, ‘bad –
good’, ‘healthy – unhealthy’ and ‘stupid – smart’.
Social support was assessed by asking respondents
how frequently their family and their friends en-
couraged them to be physically active. Self-efficacy
was measured by asking how easy or difficult is
was to continue with sports or physical activity for
30 minutes to 1 hour per day. Perceived benefits and
barriers with regard to physical activity were in-
vestigated by asking respondents to rate their agree-
ment with possible effects of sports and physical
activity (seven items: weight and physical appear-
ance, health and fitness, social interaction, pleasure,
competition, stress and depression, and relaxation
from work) and the frequency with which barriers
prevented them from exercising (seven items: lack
of time, lack of discipline, lack of interest, health
problems, personal problems, not the sporty type
and facilities too far).
Stages of changewas assessed with two questions
based on the study of Kearney et al. (Kearney et al.,
1999) investigating stages of change in 15 countries
in the European Union. In the first question, partici-
pants were asked whether they believed they did
sufficient sports or physical activity on a two-point
scale (yes/no). Those who answered ‘no’ were asked
to select one of the following three options re-
garding their intention to engage in sports or
physical activity in the future: ‘I’m not sufficiently
sporting or being physically active, and I have no
intention to start with it’ (precontemplation), ‘I’m
not sufficiently sporting or being physically active,
but I intend to start with it in the next 6 months’
(contemplation) and ‘I’m not sufficiently sporting or
being physically active, but I intend to start with it in
the next month’ (preparation). Those answering

‘yes’ choose between two options: ‘I’m currently
doing enough, and I started in the past month’
(action) and ‘I’m currently doing enough, and I
have been for more than 6 months’ (maintenance).
This staging algorithm did not include an objective
criterion for staging to action. At the time Kearney
et al. (Kearney et al., 1999) developed their staging
algorithm, almost no countries of the European
Union had physical activity standards. The same
was true for the present study. A general consensus
about the present activity standards for adolescents
was only reached in Belgium after this study was
executed. Test–re-test reliability of this staging
algorithm showed a j = 0.85 in a separate study
(Philippaerts et al., 2003).
Data analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to compute the
distribution across the stages of change for the total
group, gender groups and three age groups.
ANOVAs with Scheffe´s multiple comparison test
were used to test for significant differences in
psychosocial correlates of physical activity. All
physical activity indices were examined across the
stages of change using ANOVAs with multiple
comparison tests. In all analyses, age and sex were
included as covariates. F-values, P-values and
partial g2 as a measure of effect size are reported.
Because consecutive ANOVAs were performed,
a Bonferroni correction was used to protect against
Type I error. Adolescents were classified according
to their belief to be sufficiently active and according
to two different activity standards: 7 and 5 hours per
week physical activity. In addition, sensitivity,
specificity and related quality indices were calcu-
lated based on the recommendations of Kraemer
(Kraemer, 1992). Differences were considered to be
statistically significant when P < 0.01. All analyses
were performed using SPSS 11.0.
Results
Descriptive statistics
The distribution of the participants across the stages
(see Table I) was as follows: precontemplation, n =
684 (11.5%); contemplation, n = 948 (16.0%);
preparation, n = 818 (13.8%); action, n = 492
(8.3%); and maintenance, n = 2989 (50.4%).
Analyses revealed gender [v2(4) = 381.18, P <
0.001] and age [v2(8) = 206.18, P < 0.001] differ-
ences across stages: girls and older adolescents
were more prevalent in the preadoption stages.
Psychosocial factors as a function of the
stages of change
The results of ANOVAs and effect sizes (partial g2)
are presented in Table II. Differences between
stages of change were found for all psychosocial
factors (all P < 0.001). Partial g2 ranged between
0.06 and 0.15, showing medium to large effect
sizes. Post-hoc tests revealed differences in all
psychosocial factors between the precontemplation
stage and all other stages, and between the main-
tenance stage and all other stages. Differences in
psychosocial factors between the contemplation,
preparation and action stage were less pronounced.
Adolescents in the preparation stage reported amore
positive attitude towards physical activity and
perceived more benefits than those in the contem-
plation and action stages. Those in the preparation

and action stage reported more support from
friends, more self-efficacy and perceived less bar-
riers than those in the contemplation stage. The
differences in decisional balance between the pros
and cons across the stages was significant (P <
0.001, g2 = 0.15). The most negative balance was
found in the precontemplation stage, followed by
the contemplation stage. No significant differences
were found between the preparation and action
stage.

activity. The pattern of activity across the stages was
also similar. For all physical activity indices except
for walking or cycling to school, adolescents in
precontemplation had the lowest activity levels,
followed by those in the contemplation stage.
Adolescents in the maintenance stage had the high-
est activity levels. Preparation and action were not
significantly different. Partial g2 ranged between
0.08 and 0.16, showing medium to high effect sizes.
Adolescents in precontemplation reported less than
2 hours of sports participation per week, increasing
to 2.5 hours in contemplation, about 4 hours in
preparation and action, and more than 6.5 hours in
maintenance. For total hours of physical activity
in leisure time, adolescents in precontemplation
reported almost 3 hours per week, those in contem-
plation almost 4 hours per week, those in preparation
and action 5–6 hours per week and those in main-
tenance about 8.5 hours of physical activity per
week.Asmost schools have 2 hours of obligatory PE
per week, mean activity scores increase with about
2 hours in each stage when PE was added to hours
spent in leisure time activity. Differences between
stages were small for transportation (g2 = 0.00 and
0.01).Walking or cycling to schoolwas significantly
higher in the maintenance stage compared to the
preparation stage. Walking or cycling for trans-
portation in leisure time was higher in the main-
tenance and the preparation stage compared to the
precontemplation stage. No differences were found
between the stages of change for sedentary behavior
measured by hours watching TV or video and
playing computer games or using the Internet. The
mean score for adolescents in all stages was about
3.5 hours per day.
Sensitivity and specificity of the stages
of change
The classification of respondents related to aware-
ness, sensitivity, specificity and related quality
indices are presented in Table IV. Total hours
physical activity per week including PE was used as
the outcome variable. Compared to both norms,
about 70% of the adolescents were realistic about
their level of physical activity. The kind of mis-
classification was dependent on the norm. Over-
estimation was most prominent when the most
stringent norm (7 hours per week) was used.
Seventeen percent overestimated their activity com-
pared to only 9% with the less stringent criterion
(5 hours per week). One-fifth of the adolescents
underestimated their activity level using the 5 hours
per week norm compared to only 12% for the 7
hours per week norm. The sensitivity and specifi-
city of the staging instrument were good. The
related quality indexes were moderate.
Discussion
Compared to a meta-analysis including 71 studies
using mainly adult participants (Marshall and
Biddle, 2001), there were less adolescents in the
present study in precontemplation, preparation and
action, butmore inmaintenance. Our distribution for
adolescents makes sense because adolescence is

a period of drop-out from sports and not a period of
picking up new physical activities (Sallis, 2000).
This is further corroborated by our finding that there
is a drop from 60% of the 12–13 year olds in the
maintenance phase to 40% of the 17–18 year olds.
These results replicate and extend previous findings.
Only one previous study (Nigg and Courneya, 1998)
investigated the stages of change in a Canadian
sample covering thewhole adolescent period (12–18
year olds). In that study, 819 adolescents with
a mean age of 15 years (range 13–19) participated
and there was a response rate of 61%. Nigg and
Courneya (Nigg and Courneya, 1998) found very
low rates in precontemplation (2.1%) and contem-
plation (4.2%). A large group of adolescents were in
maintenance (49.3%), preparation (28.7%) and ac-
tion (15.7%). They attributed the low percentages of
adolescents in the first two stages to the fact that
non-exercisers probably did not fill in the question-
naire. Other researchers studied a group of younger
children (Cardinal et al., 1998; Walton et al., 1999;
Hausenblas et al., 2002) and found 60–88% of the
children in the action or maintenance stages.
As all adolescents within the participating classes
in the present study responded, the stage distribu-
tion may be considered as a good estimate of the
population prevalence in each stage. About 59% of
the adolescents classified themselves in the adop-
tion stages. This means that they are convinced to
do sufficient physical activity. The data showed that
for 71% of the adolescents, their classification
corresponds with their self-reported physical activ-
ity level. The algorithm overstaged only 17% (7
hours per week standard) or 9% (5 hours per week
standard) of the adolescents. This means that
adolescents do better than Dutch adults from which
a substantial proportion of the respondents (35.6%)
overestimate their physical activity level in relation
to the recommended target of 30 minutes on at least
5 days a week (Ronda et al., 2001). From a health
promotion perspective this is important information
as unrealistic self-assessment is often a barrier to
encourage people to move forward in the behav-
ioral change process because they see no need to
change. From the present study it could be argued
that adolescents classify themselves reasonable re-
liably into the stages of change. However, including
an objective staging criterion into the algorithm
could further improve self-assessment, and possibly
show a more clear distinction between the prepar-
ation and action stage.
Previous studies on the stages of change often
used a general and short physical activity question-
naire (Godin et al., 1986). In the present study,
a broad definition of physical activity was used.
Differences across stages of change were not only
found for sport participation or total physical
activity (high effect sizes), but also for sport at
school except PE and active transportation (lower
effect sizes). This suggests that ‘active’ adolescents
are active at different levels and that ‘inactive’ ones
combine an inactive lifestyle with little sport
participation. The latter group is probably at extra
risk as they do not compensate for their lack of sport
participation with daily activity.
Two additional issues arise from the stage dis-
tribution of physical activity in our sample. First, it
is clear that adolescents within the preadoption
stages or those within the adoption stages do not
only differ in intention, but also in behavior. As the
Transtheoretical Model was developed based on
smoking research (Prochaska and DiClemente,
1983), the behavior difference between the pre-
adoption and adoption stages in smoking is obvious
(smoking versus non-smoking) and persons within
those stages only differed in intention. However,
for physical activity, a gradual increase across the
stages of change is not exceptional. In their review,
Marshall and Biddle (Marshall and Biddle, 2001)
found that the level of physical activity increased as
individuals moved to a higher stage of change.
They suggested that transitions within preadoption
stages are also associated with changes in physical
activity. This shows that people probably need
physical activity experiences and some initial
changes in physical activity before they decide to
adopt adequate levels of physical activity. A second
issue that deserves attention is the lack of difference
between the preparation and the action stage for all
measures of physical activity in the present study.
In their review, Marshall and Biddle (Marshall and
Biddle, 2001) found the largest effects for physical

activity from preparation to action, which seems
evident as individuals move from preadoption to
adoption and reach an activity criterion. It is
possible that this is a specific phenomenon in
adolescents. As the decline in physical activity is
typical in adolescence, it is possible that adoles-
cents do not progress through the stages of change
from precontemplation to maintenance as is ex-
pected in adults, but the other way around. In
primary school, a high percentage of children are in
maintenance (Cardinal et al., 1998; Walton et al.,
1999). Our data reveal that about 20% will drop
into the preadoption stages during adolescence.
Surprisingly, no differences were found across
stages of change for sedentary activities such as TV
viewing or computer use. It is often assumed that
a lack of physical activity goes together with a high
level of sedentary activities (Robinson, 1999). Our
data reveal a mean difference of about 5 hours of
physical activity per week between adolescents in
maintenance and those in precontemplation, but no
difference in sedentary activities. A mean score of
about 3.5 hours TV viewing and computer use per
day was found for adolescents in all stages. This is
in line with the recent research of Marshall et al.
(Marshall et al., 2002) who argued that physical
activity and sedentary behavior are not two sides of
the same coin. Using cluster analyses in a sample of
11- to 15-year-old adolescents from the US and the
UK, they showed that sedentary behavior can
sometimes compete with and sometimes coexist
with physical activity.
At present, concepts from the Transtheoretical
Model and from the Theory of Planned Behavior
are most often used to understand and guide
interventions for physical activity. The combination
of both theories makes it possible to provide guide-
lines to target particular determinants as a function
of stage. A stable pattern was found in which
determinants positively related to physical activity
increase gradually through the stages of change.
This general increase in psychosocial determinants
as a function of stages of change is in line with
previous studies in adults (Marshall and Biddle
2001; Ronda et al., 2001) and in adolescents (Nigg
and Courneya, 1998). Adolescents in the precon-
templation stage and those in the maintenance stage
differed very strongly on psychosocial factors from
all other stages. Distinctions between the contem-
plation, preparation and action stages were less
pronounced for psychosocial factors. It could be
argued that not five, but three types of adolescents
could be distinguished: adolescents in the extreme
stages show, respectively, an unfavorable (precon-
templation) and a very favorable (maintenance)
pattern of determinants; adolescents in the contem-
plation, preparation and action stages can be con-
sidered as one group; with a psychosocial pattern in
between both extremes. This has implications for
tailoring intervention strategies promoting physical
activity in adolescents to the stages of change.
Although the score for the pros still outnumbered
the cons in adolescents in the precontemplation
stage, they clearly perceived most barriers and least
benefits. In addition, adolescents in the precontem-
plation stage reported the least social support from
family and friends, but especially a very low self-
efficacy. In a previous study, tracking from adoles-
cence into young adulthood was investigated for
physical activity and psychosocial determinants
(De Bourdeaudhuij et al., 2002). This study revealed
that over a 7-year period, high tracking scores
were found for determinants of physical activity
such as perceived benefits, perceived barriers and
self-efficacy. This relative stability of psychosocial
determinants together with the rather low participa-
tion in physical activity argues for early interven-
tions, especially in this first group of youngsters in
the precontemplation stage, to make cognitions and
emotions related to physical activity more positive.
In addition, higher levels of modeling and social
support in the home/school/social environment of
the adolescent in the precontemplation stage are
needed. For a second group of adolescents, those in
the contemplation, preparation and action stages,
physical activity interventions need to focus on the
maintenance of adequate levels of activity. Most
adolescents in those stages are still relatively active
meeting the activity standards, but it is very likely
that their activity levels will considerably drop when
they reach young adulthood. For this subgroup,
interventions should be tailored towards increasing

self-efficacy; more specifically, in overcoming per-
ceived barriers related to physical activity. The third
subgroup of adolescents in the maintenance stage
does not need further encouragement of physical
activity, as they have very favorable psychosocial
determinants, together with high sport participation
and high lifestyle physical activity scores. However,
context changes such as leaving home and the
transition into higher education or the labor market
could cause a considerable drop in physical activity
in this yet highly motivated subgroup (Caspersen
et al., 2000; De Bourdeaudhuij et al., 2002). In-
formation is needed on how activity patterns can be
converted from structured sports participation into
lifestyle physical activity within changing contexts
for this subgroup.
There were several limitations of the present
study. First, the data relied on self-reports of physical
activity and psychosocial variables. Despite the use
of validated questionnaires, some over-reporting of
physical activity may be present. Second, only the
stages of change concept in relation to psychosocial
variables was tested in the present study, not the
Transtheoretical Model as a whole. Third, the
algorithm used to classify respondents into stages
of changewas based upon previousworkwith adults
in Europe and did not include definitional criteria
such as information about frequency, duration or
intensity of physical activity needed. This makes it
harder for respondents to categorize themselves into
the ‘right’ stage. Although we believe that the
staging algorithm worked with few misclassifica-
tions, we agree with Marshall and Biddle (Marshall
and Biddle, 2001) that it is better to include an
activity criterion to define action when categorizing
stages of change in the future. Finally, as this study
was cross-sectional in nature, no information is
available on progression or regression through
stages during adolescence.Asweexpect a regression
in adolescents, in line with the decline in physical
activity during this period, longitudinal studies are
needed to further our understanding on these
processes.
We can conclude that our data partly support the
validity of the stages of change model for physical
activity in adolescents. Higher levels of physical
activity of different intensity and within different
contexts, and more favorable psychosocial deter-
minants were found in the later stages. A large
percentage of the adolescents placed themselves in
a stage which was in accordance with their self-
reported level of physical activity. Intervention
strategies to adolescents can be tailored based on
their stage of change. However, some differences
were also revealed. Adolescents within the pre-
adoption stages or those within the adoption stages
did not only differ in intention, but also in behavior.
No differences in physical activity were found
between the preparation and the action stage. With
regard to psychosocial factors, adolescents in the
contemplation, preparation and action stages can be
considered as one group, which has implications for
interventions. Further research is warranted in this
age group on the progression and regression
through the stages of change for physical activity,
and the implications for tailoring interventions.
