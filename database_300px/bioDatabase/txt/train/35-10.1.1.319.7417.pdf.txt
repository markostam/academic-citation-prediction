ABSTRACT
The Kinefold web server provides a web interface
for stochastic folding simulations of nucleic acids on
second to minute molecular time scales. Renatura-
tion or co-transcriptional folding paths are simulated
at the level of helix formation and dissociation
in agreement with the seminal experimental results.
Pseudoknots and topologically ‘entangled’ helices
(i.e. knots)areefficientlypredicted taking intoaccount
simple geometrical and topological constraints. To
encourage interactivity, simulations launched as
immediate jobs are automatically stopped after a
few seconds and return adapted recommendations.
Users can then choose to continue incomplete simu-
lations using the batch queuing system or go back
and modify suggested options in their initial query.
Detailed output provide (i) a series of low free energy
structures, (ii) an online animated folding path and
(iii) a programmable trajectory plot focusing on a few
helices of interest to each user. The service can be
accessed at http://kinefold.curie.fr/.
INTRODUCTION
The prediction of RNA secondary structures with no known
homologous sequences has been traditionally performed
through free energy minimization using efficient ‘dynamic
programming’ algorithms (1–6). These approaches and
recent developments combining thermodynamic and homo-
logy information have now been interfaced by a number of
web servers for RNA/DNA structure prediction (7–11).
Simulations of nucleic acid folding paths (12–19) can com-
plement these primary thermodynamic approaches and pro-
vide interesting insights into DNA/RNA folding dynamics.
Applications include, in particular, anomalous hybridization
kinetics on DNA chips and structural rearrangements of
non-coding RNA regions involved in (post)-transcriptional
regulation of genetic expression.
The Kinefold web server performs online stochastic folding
simulations of nucleic acids using the folding dynamics algo-
rithm introduced by Isambert and Siggia (17) and further
enhanced by the ‘exactly clustered stochastic simulation’ algo-
rithm detailed by Xayaphoummine et al. (19). The web server
was launched at Institut de Physique (Strasbourg, France) in
August 2002 and operated there until August 2004, when it was
relocated at Institut Curie (Section de Recherche, Paris, France).
Early features of Kinefold included the prediction of pseu-
doknots based on a ‘physical’ constraint model using polymer
theory (17). Pseudoknot predictions were successfully tested
on a variety of small pseudoknots (17), as well as on longer
sequences such as 394 nt Tetrahymena group I intron (19).
Predictions on folding dynamics and pathways have also been
compared with folding experiments, probing natural (17)
and designed DNA or RNA sequences (Viasnoff,V.,
Meller,A. and Isambert,H., submitted for publication and
Xayaphoummine,A., Viasnoff,V., Harlepp,S. and Isambert,H.,
submitted for publication). In addition, the molecular basis of
these stochastic folding simulations has been directly tested
with detailed analysis of single-molecule micromechanical
unfolding/refolding experiments performed on small RNA
motifs and on 1524 nt 16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia
coli (20).
New features of Kinefold include DNA sequence folding,
forced helices and topologically ‘entangled’ helices (i.e. knots),
which have been recently added as simulation parameters.
OVERVIEW OF KINEFOLD FEATURES
Stochastic folding simulation of nucleic acids
Kinefold simulates nucleic acid folding paths at the level
of nucleation and dissociation of RNA/DNA helix regions
(12,17) (minimum 3 bp, maximum 60 bp), including pseudo-
knots and topologically ‘entangled’ helices. These stochastic
formation and the removal of individual helices are known to

be the time-limiting steps of RNA/DNA folding kinetics from
the seminal experimental results (21,22). Single-strand dif-
fusion and individual base-pair stacking/unstacking processes,
which have much faster intrinsic dynamics (0.1 ms) than the
relevant time scale for nucleic acid folding and unfolding
(>10 ms), are assumed to be in a state of quasistatic equilibrium
with the rare stochastic transitions between visited secondary
structures. The folding path then consists of a discrete series
of secondary structures related through successive additions or
removals of single helices. Yet, it happens frequently that the
trajectory will oscillate repeatedly between a few structures,
and only much more slowly transit to visit new configurations.
To circumvent these local kinetic traps that can severely impact
the efficiency of the code, folding paths are in fact continu-
ously averaged at the level of rapidly exchanging structures
using the ‘exactly clustered stochastic simulation’ approach
detailed previously (19).
Overall, Kinefold can simulate physical folding paths
over second to minute molecular time scales for nucleic acid
sequences up to 300–400 bases.
Unlike traditional RNA/DNA folding algorithms (1–6),
stochastic simulations do not aim, a priori, at finding lowest
free energy structures. In practice, however, they usually find
those minima rather quickly, provided that the simulated
molecular time is long enough. However, this relaxation time
may vary significantly from sequence to sequence, even for
similar sequence length and G+C-content, and users are
advised to run a few independent folding simulations for
each sequence submitted to the web server (see Simulated
molecular time and Random seed subsections).
Ultimately, long sequences may not have enough time to
reach their lowest free energy structures on physiological time
scales (typically minutes) (23) and co-transcriptional folding
pathways (24) likely to control proper folding into native
structures in this case (Xayaphoummine,A., Viasnoff,V.,
Harlepp,S. and Isambert,H., submitted for publication).
Besides, there are indications that co-transcriptional folding
pathways of functional RNAs might be encoded into transient
non-native helices (17,25). Kinefold stochastic simulations
provide an effective approach to predict co-transcriptional
folding paths of functional RNAs either into their lowest
energy structures or into functional or misfolded kinetic traps.
Pseudoknots and topologically entangled helices
Besides addressing specific issues about folding kinetics,
simulating RNA/DNA folding pathways also allows for the
formation of helices interior to loops, the so-called ‘pseudo-
knots’ (13,17,19). We found that neglecting pseudoknots
typically induces extended structural changes in secondary
structure predictions (far beyond the missing pseudoknots
themselves) owing to the strong cooperativity of RNA struc-
ture rearrangements (see discussion below and Supplementary
Material 1).
Owing to their non-nested nature, pseudoknots are ‘intrins-
ically non-local in sequence space’ (i.e. crossing arcs) and
difficult to include in secondary structure predictions
(13,17,19,26–31). Yet, the 3D ‘physical’ constraints they
cause to nucleic acid structures can be ‘locally modeled in
structure space’ within substructures called ‘nets’ (17). The
entropic stretching of single strands and the correlation of
helix orientation within each elementary net are analytically
calculated by modeling RNA/DNA helices as stiff rods and
single-stranded regions as polymer springs. This is also com-
plemented with a more global conformational entropy con-
tribution at larger length scale (no entropic stretching of single
strands at this scale) (17).
Beyond these geometric constraints, the formation of a
pseudoknot may also induce helical topological constraints
both on itself (Figure 1A) and on the ‘entanglement state’
of other non-nested helices in the surrounding (Figure 1B).
(i) The first topological constraint (Figure 1A) arises because
a pseudoknot of n helical turns requires a compensating
twist of n turns on the coil sections. While most helices
are shorter than a full turn (10–11 bp), longer pseudoknots
are ‘topologically destabilized’ by this self-induced entro-
pic constraint. Hence, counter-twisting topological con-
straints associated with long pseudoknots do not create
new or enhanced transition barriers for the nucleic acid
folding/unfolding dynamics. In practice, the local contri-
bution of self-induced topological constraints to global
Boltzman weight are estimated at the level of ‘nets’ (17)
with a longer apparent stretching distance on the single-
strand twisting around the pseudoknot (see below).
(ii) Conversely, the effect of pseudoknots on the ‘entangle-
ment state’ of other non-nested helices in their surrounding
can be much more dramatic and lead to new kinetic
traps for topologically ‘entangled’ helices (Figure 1B).
Entangled helices are defined as helices longer than half
a helix turn (>6 bp) whose unpairing transition is topolo-
gically impeded by the presence of at least one pseudoknot;
when an entangled helix unpairs from an RNA/DNA struc-
ture, the newly unpaired bases cannot freely separate due
to the residual ‘tangle’ [after Conway’s classification of
knots (32)] left behind by the unpaired helix. Such helical
entanglement cannot be generally resolved until all the
pseudoknots blocking its release through free rotation
are simultaneously removed, hence effectively leaving
entangled helices kinetically trapped. Entanglements can
prevent, in particular, pseudoknots and long adjacent
helices from rearranging during co-transcriptional folding
owing to topologically blocked transition intermediates.
Thismaycause long-livedmetastablestructuresofuntrans-
lated region (UTR) RNA switches regulating the expres-
sion of downstream genes at the level of either transcription

Figure 1. Helical topological constraints caused by pseudoknots. (A) Self-
induced counter-twist constraints restrict the entropy of stretched single strands,
hence resulting in an effective destabilization of long pseudoknots. (B) Long,
topologically entangled helices leave a residual ‘tangle’ (32) behind when
unpairing from the structure. This results in their effective stabilization until
all pseudoknots blocking the helical entanglement are simultaneously
removed.

tration). Kinefold represents base pairs of entangled
helices with the same color as the phosphate-ribose back-
bone to emphasize the apparent strength of these bonds.

formational entropy of ‘nets’ (Figure 2) depends on individual

of RNA (resp. DNA) base pairs, d = 3.3a (resp. 2.7a) is the
apparent helix diameter (in base unit a = 6s), np = 11 (resp. 10)
is the number of base pairs per complete turn, and h = 5a
(resp. 5.6a) is the stem length for one turn (33).
Stochastic folding simulations are restricted to all the RNA/
DNA structures that can be locally decomposed into nets with
no more than two internal helices of respective length l1 and l2.
Their conformational entropy and all entropic transition bar-
riers to nucleate a new helix within such net are found to

A multiplicative factor a, corresponding to the ‘confinement’
cost each time a loop is formed, is added for each helix on the
structure [a = 0.0068 has been tuned to best fit the tabulated
thermodynamic parameters for short loops (34,35)]. The para-
meters A1, A2, A3 and D depend on the single-strand lengths
(s1, s2, . . . , sk), the net class and for transition barriers, on the
actual transition within the net class. The expressions of A1,
A2, A3 and D are given in Table 1 for all the included nets,
together with the most complex transition barrier for which
we also provide a scanned analytic calculus in Supplementary

barriers can be deduced from the later result taking simple
limits.

INPUT AND OPTIONS
Input, options and output for the web server are documen-
ted online by a help page with a direct link for each of the
following items.
Sequence
The sequence should be a string of unmodified RNA/DNA
bases (A, U/T, G, C) and may also include additional (X) bases
which do not pair. X can be used to model modified bases or
to investigate hybridization dynamics between two sequences
by artificially connecting them with a long linker of Xs. The
current length limitation is set to 400 bases for both ‘renat-
uration fold’ and ‘co-transcriptional fold’ simulations but,
depending on their G+C-content, long sequences might not
have relaxed by the maximum duration of the stochastic
simulation (1 day). Hence, new users are strongly advised
to start their query with shorter subsequences (e.g. up to 200
nt) to obtain a first understanding of the potentials and the
limitations of Kinefold and its various available options
described below.
RNA versus DNA
Stochastic folding simulations are performed either on RNA
(default) or on DNA sequences using stacking free energy
parameters from the Turner laboratory (34,35) and the
SantaLucia laboratory (36), respectively. Unpublished ter-
minal mismatches for DNA are estimated by adding 50 and
30 dandling end stackings, while helix–helix stacking is estim-
ated by double counting terminal mismatches. These approx-
imations generate smaller errors on global molecular free
energy (a few percents) than the intrinsic error bars on
Watson–Crick base pair stacking energies (10–15%).
Type of stochastic simulation
RNA/DNA folding pathways largely depend on folding con-
ditions. Two types of folding scenarios are currently available
(both at 37C with 1 M NaCl and no divalent ions) and are as
follows.
Renaturation fold. Folding starts from a completely denatured
configuration (high temperature, no helix formed) which is
then instantaneously cooled to 37C. Alternatively, users have
the possibility to force some initial helices on the structure
(see Forcing helices).
Co-transcriptional fold. Folding proceeds while the sequence
is being ‘synthetized’ (from its 50 to 30 ends). The transcription
rate can be tuned to fit average transcription speeds of different
RNA polymerases: a new base is typically added every 3, 20 or
200 ms with T7 phage, prokaryote or eukaryote RNA poly-
merase, respectively. The nascent transcript starts to fold
before the whole sequence is fully available. Depending on
actual sequence, co-transcriptional folding may guide fold-
ing or mislead RNA molecules into long-lived metastable
configurations. An example of animated co-transcriptional
folding path visualized with the Kineviewer Java applet can
be found at http://kinefold.curie.fr/cgi-bin/viewer1.pl?file=
HDVribozyme.coord.
Simulated molecular time
The simulated molecular time corresponds to the actual time
experienced by the RNA/DNA molecule, not the time needed
for the simulation to run (which can be much longer).
The web server automatically estimates a statistical folding
time for each submitted sequence. However, users can also
predefine the total simulated molecular time, which should be
between 1 and 10 000 000 ms (i.e. 3 h). The ‘Enforced time’
option is very convenient to restrict the simulation time for
long sequences; Above 300 bases, a good starting point is to
first simulate a few independent folding paths (see Random
seed) of 10 000 ms to check for early reproducibility of
folding paths before requesting longer runs such as 30 000
or 100 000 ms.
Pseudoknots
They are visualized for convenience as colored single-stranded
regions connected by two straight lines corresponding to the
first and last base pairs of the pseudoknot. In the actual simu-
lation, however, pseudoknots are locally treated as any regular
helices and the 3D conformational entropic constraints they
cause are evaluated using a coarse-grained geometric app-
roach based on modeling RNA/DNA helices as stiff rods and
single-stranded regions as polymer springs (17) (Figure 2 and
Table 1). Pseudoknots are included by default in stochastic
folding paths but they can also be excluded altogether by users.
We have performed extensive statistics on pseudoknot
prevalence in random and natural RNA sequences [see
Supplementary Material 1 and (19)]. While the proportion
of pseudoknots among base pairs is typically 10–15% on aver-
age, the actual variation between different sequences is quite
broad (from 0 up to 30% for G+C-rich molecules). More-
over, we found that excluding the formation of pseudoknots
on an RNA structure, where they correspond to 10% of
base pairs, typically induces much more dramatic base pair
changes (>30%) owing to the strong cooperativity of secondary
structure rearrangements. This has also been independently
observed [Table 4 in (37)] by comparing the accuracy of
secondary structure predictions without pseudoknots to known
secondary structures including a small number of pseudoknots
(up to 10%). In fact, we have found that the distribution of
base pair identity between low energy structures with and
without pseudoknots is essentially ‘flat’ (see Supplementary
Material 1); there is virtually no correlation between predic-
tions including and excluding pseudoknots. This suggests
some intrinsic limitations for predicting pseudoknots through
iterative approaches starting from non-pseudoknotted struc-
tures, unless they are also combined to comparative methods
using homologous sequences (10,11).
Entanglements
Kinefold freezes the unpairing transitions of ‘entangled’ heli-
ces (Figure 1) while they remain entangled. Meanwhile ter-
minal zipping/unzipping adjustments still occur and ‘detailed
balance’ is perfectly maintained throughout the simulation
(as it should be). This new option is particularly recommended
when users suspect ‘kinetically trapped alternative structures’
with their sequence. For clarity, the base pair connections of
entangled helices are colored in green (Figure 3).

Tracing and forcing helices
There can be maximum of five helices (minimum 3 bp,
maximum 60 bp).
Tracing helices. Users can follow whether certain helices of
special interest to them are formed or not on the structure as
the sequence folds. This can be helpful, in particular, to identi-
fy transient helices (minimum of three stacking base pairs) that
are eventually removed in the native structure. Helix traces are
graphically displayed on the trajectory plot.
Enter T i j k, with k > 2 on one line to trace when any of the
consecutive base pairs i,j, i + 1,j 1, . . . , i + k 1j k + 1 is
formed.
Forcing helices. In ‘renaturation fold’ mode, users may also
force k > 2 consecutive base pairs on the RNA structure
(minimum of three stacking base pairs). During folding, the
corresponding helices will not be removed, shrunk nor exten-
ded by additional matching base pairs, while the rest of the
molecule will fold normally. Forced helices, which should be
non-overlapping and compatible with the pseudoknot require-
ments, are also graphically displayed on the trajectory plot.
Improper specifications are automatically dismissed.
Enter F i j k, with k > 2 on one line to force the consecutive
base pairs ij, i + 1j  1, . . . , i + k  1j  k + 1 (and prevent
additional extension).
Random seed
Each folding request simulates one single folding pathway.
As RNA folding kinetics is a stochastic process during which
certain helices are successively formed and removed some-
what randomly (see Type of stochastic simulation subsection),
folding pathways may vary significantly from run to run.
Hence, before drawing any positive or negative conclusions
for a specific sequence, users are advised to try a few runs to
look for possible variations. Independent runs are generated
with different random seeds, which are integers between 1 and
10 000. One is automatically generated each time the request
page is refreshed. Alternatively, it is also possible to choose
a particular random seed in order to redo the very same simu-
lation provided that all other parameters remain unchanged
too with the exception of the ‘simulated molecular time’ and
‘Traced heliced’.
 In ‘renaturation fold’ mode, three independent folding path-
ways leading to the same structure(s) is a good indication
(although not a proof ) that the lowest free energy structures
have been reached. Alternative scenarios may suggest long-
lived metastable configurations of potential interest.
 In ‘co-transcriptional fold’ mode, robust features over a few
independent runs (like for instance similar ‘trajectory plots’
for strong specific helices) are also good indications of well-
defined folding pathways either toward a native structure or
toward a long-lived kinetically trapped configuration.
OUTPUT
The output page provides (i) a series of low free energy struc-
tures, (ii) an online animated folding path and (iii) a program-
mable trajectory plot focusing on a few helices of interest to
each user. Owing to space limitation, these are presented and
discussed in Supplementary Material 3.
