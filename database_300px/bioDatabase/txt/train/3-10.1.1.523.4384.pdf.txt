ABSTRACT
The increasing number of solved macromolecules
provides a solid number of 3D interfaces, if all
types of molecular contacts are being considered.
JAIL annotates three different kinds of macromolec-
ular interfaces, those between interacting protein
domains, interfaces of different protein chains and
interfaces between proteins and nucleic acids. This
results in a total number of about 184 000 database
entries. All the interfaces can easily be identified by
a detailed search form or by a hierarchical tree that
describes the protein domain architectures classi-
fied by the SCOP database. Visual inspection of the
interfaces is possible via an interactive protein
viewer. Furthermore, large scale analyses are sup-
ported by an implemented sequential and by a
structural clustering. Similar interfaces as well as
non-redundant interfaces can be easily picked out.
Additionally, the sequential conservation of binding
sites was also included in the database and is
retrievable via Jmol. A comprehensive download
section allows the composition of representative
data sets with user defined parameters. The huge
data set in combination with various search options
allow a comprehensive view on all interfaces
between macromolecules included in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB). The download of the data sets
supports numerous further investigations in macro-
molecular recognition. JAIL is publicly available at
http://bioinformatics.charite.de/jail.
INTRODUCTION
Proteins interact quickly and speciﬁcally with each other
or with nucleic acids. All interactions form a bio-
chemical network that reﬂects the high complexity of
cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, the vast majority of
all interactions are not yet identiﬁed and are subject to
current research (1). An important step towards the
mechanistic descriptions of such interactions is the 3D
structural information of macromolecules. However, com-
plexed proteins are diﬃcult to co-crystallize and the
number of publicly available X-ray structures in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (2) is very limited (3). Thus,
a structure-based analysis of particular interacting macro-
molecules is often only possible by using docking models.
For systematic analyses the problem of the low number
of protein–protein complexes might be avoided by taking
into consideration interacting domains or chains. Such
types of interfaces often exhibit a similar behaviour like
those of interacting proteins (4). For instance, knowledge-
based potential functions that represent the co-occurrence
of certain residues might be similar for contacts between
domains of a single chain as well as contacts between
proteins. Another approach is the utilization of the inter-
faces between domains or chains to detect structural simi-
larities to binding sites of interacting proteins. First
applications apply this method for protein–protein com-
plex modelling (5). Consequentially, some structure-based
databases exist that focus on the interacting parts of pro-
teins. SCOPPI (6), SNAPPI (7) and PIBASE (8) classify
interfaces between domains, the domain information was
retrieved from SCOP (9), CATH (10) or Pfam (11). Since
they depend on domain deﬁnitions extracted from second-
ary databases especially structures solved during the last
few years are normally not yet classiﬁed (12). HotSprint
(13) focuses on conserved residues in chain contact sites
and is regularly updated but domain information is
ignored. Dockground (3) comprises the so far most
comprehensive data set of interacting proteins and
chains respectively. The excellent database also provides
user deﬁned data sets of the associated unbound protein-
binding sites. Nevertheless, it focuses on protein–protein
interaction, so information about intra-chain contacts is
not retrievable. None of the mentioned databases contains
interfaces between proteins and nucleic acids. Although
each application is useful to enlighten questions the data-
base is specialized for, a comprehensive web resource that
combines all the diﬀerent kinds of interfaces between
macromolecules is not available. Furthermore, the data-
base should be characterized by regular updates and the

opportunity to download appropriate data sets. To over-
come this lack we developed JAIL, a structure-based inter-
face library for macromolecules.
DATABASE
Currently, the database contains more than 184 000 inter-
faces that are composed of four diﬀerent fractions: 81 000
interfaces between domains classiﬁed by SCOP, 76 000
interfaces between diﬀerent protein chains, 8000 inter-
faces between proteins and nucleic acids and 19 000 inter-
faces which were calculated based on the assumed
biological units. Since they were not directly solved cris-
tallographically, they are annotated separately. The inter-
faces result from the evaluation of 52 000 diﬀerent
asymmetric unit ﬁles as well as the associated biological
unit ﬁles provided by the PDB. An interface is deﬁned as
those atoms of a chain or domain that are located within a
range of 10 A˚ around the Ca-atoms of the interacting
counterpart. In the case of nucleic acids the backbone
(P/C40)-atoms were considered. Each binding site has to
consist of at least ﬁve Ca-atoms as the case may be
backbone atoms of the nucleic acids. Assumed biological
units were calculated based on the ﬁrst two models build
up by reﬂection of the unit cells. Information on the evo-
lutionary conservation was extracted from the HSSP
database (14). The PDB-IDs of nucleic acids containing
structures were retrieved from the Nucleic Acid Database
(15). All chains of the database were sequentially clustered
using the regular updated lists provided by the PDB cal-
culated by the Cd-hit program (16). Thus, it is possible, to
select interfaces of proteins, which are similar in sequence
to each other as well as to download non-redundant data
sets based on protein sequences. Structural clustering was
implemented by the selection of representative interfaces
of each family–family or superfamily–superfamily contact
between domains classiﬁed in SCOP. A protein can be
identiﬁed by a detailed search form that allows searches
by PDB-ID, protein name, EC-number, UniProt acces-
sion number or SCOP-ID. An implemented full text
search allows the screening to the full header informa-
tion of the structure-ﬁle as well as the SCOP domain
descriptions. Visualization of the interfaces was implemen-
ted by pre-generated thumbnails of each interface and on
the other hand by the interactive protein visualizer Jmol

(http://www.jmol.org). The download section provides
various possibilities to build up a user deﬁned data set.
Structurally, clustered interfaces based on the SCOP
domain deﬁnitions as well as sequentially clustered inter-
faces based on protein chain clustering are separately
retrievable but can also be combined. Parameters like
the SCOP-hierarchy (family/superfamily) or the sequence
identity level (50%, 70%, 90% and 95%) are selectable.
The database is automatically updated six times a year.
EXAMPLE OF USE
The provided browsable interfaces support the answer-
ing of various further investigations. One of them is the
comparative study of molecular recognition of nucleic
acids and proteins. For instance, experimental evidence
exists, that proteins mimic nucleic acids to usurp the role
of interacting macromolecules (17,18). Shape comparisons
of diﬀerent kinds of interfaces (protein–protein/protein–
nucleic acids) may help to identify cases of molecular
mimicry.
A matter of particular interest in this context is the
identiﬁcation of protein domains that interact with other
proteins as well as with nucleic acids. Figure 1 shows an
example of a search for such a case by using the imple-
mented ‘Show related proteins’-option. Figure 2 shows the
resulting interfaces of a fab-fragment in complex with an
enzyme. The same domain architecture is also capable to
bind single stranded hairpin DNA.
