ABSTRACT
The prokaryotic DNA polymerase III clamp loader
complex loads the b clamp onto DNA to link the
replication complex to DNA during processive
synthesis and unloads it again once synthesis is
complete. This minimal complex consists of one d,
one d0 and three g subunits, all of which possess an
AAA1 module—though only the g subunit exhibits
ATPase activity. Here clues to underlying clamp
loader mechanisms are obtained through Bayesian
inference of various categories of selective con-
straints imposed on the g and d0 subunits. It is
proposed that a conserved histidine is ionized via
electron transfer involving structurally adjacent
residues within the sensor 1 region of g’s AAA1
module. The resultant positive charge on this
histidine inhibits ATPase activity by drawing the
negatively charged catalytic base away from the
active site. It is also proposed that this arrangement
is disrupted upon interaction of DNA with basic
residues in g implicated previously in DNA binding,
regarding which a lysine that is near the sensor 1
region and that is highly conserved both in bacterial
and in eukaryotic clamp loader ATPases appears to
play a critical role. g ATPases also appear to utilize a
trans-acting threonine that is donated by helix 6 of
an adjacent g or d0 subunit and that assists in the
activation of a water molecule for nucleophilic
attack on the g phosphorous atom of ATP. As
eukaryotic and archaeal clamp loaders lack most of
these key residues, it appears that eubacteria utilize
a fundamentally different mechanism for clamp
loader activation than do these other organisms.
THE CLAMP LOADER COMPLEX
The tracking of prokaryotic DNA polymerase III along the
replication fork during DNA synthesis requires a topological
link to DNA. This is provided by the b subunit, which
functions as a sliding clamp [reviewed in (1,2)] to keep the
catalytic a subunit on the DNA for tens of thousands of
base pairs or more without dissociating (3,4). Two b subunits
associate to form a stable homodimeric ring (5) that thus must
be opened for loading onto DNA before DNA synthesis and
for unloading once DNA replication is completed. This load-
ing and unloading reaction is catalyzed by the g clamp loader
(6–8) [reviewed in (9)], the minimal complex of which con-
sists of one copy each of the d and d0 subunits and three cop-
ies of the g subunit (designated gB, gC and gD) (10,11). All
three types of subunits possess an AAA+ module (11,12).
AAA+ modules typically function in the assembly and disas-
sembly of protein complexes [reviewed by (13)] and are char-
acterized by an N-terminal P loop ATP-binding domain (14)
(domain I) followed (C-terminally) by a helical bundle
domain (domain II). Only the g AAA+ module exhibits
ATPase activity; d and d0 do not. All three subunits also con-
tain a C-terminal domain (domain III). Although this minimal
g complex has been extensively used for in vitro analyses,
in vivo two t subunits replace two of the g subunits, which
are encoded by the same gene as the t subunit, but—owing
to a translational frameshift—lack an additional C-terminal
extension that plays a critical role in binding of the clamp
loader to core polymerase (15). These two forms of the
clamp loader complex may be treated as identical for our
purposes here.
The eukaryotic and archaeal clamp loader complexes,
termed replication factor C (RFC), similarly harbor AAA+
modules with attached C-terminal domains and are thought
to be functionally analogous to the bacterial g complex
[reviewed in (16)]. Unlike the g complex, however, the euka-
ryotic complex contains five distinct subunits: RFC-A
(corresponding to d), RFC-B, RFC-C and RFC-D (corres-
ponding to gB, gC and gD, respectively), and RFC-E
(corresponding to d0), whereas the archaeal clamp loader
complex typically contains only two types of subunits:
RFCL (corresponding to d) and RFCS (corresponding to
both g and d0).
Numerous structural studies provide insights into bacterial
clamp loaders. These include crystal structures (i) of isolated
g and d0 subunits (17,18), (ii) of ATP, ADP and nucleotide

free forms of the minimal g complex (11,19) and (iii) of a
complex of the d subunit bound to the b clamp (20). These
studies reveal that the five clamp loader subunits mutually
interact via their third C-terminal domains. These domains
are arranged in the order d-gB-gC-gD-d0 to form a circular
collar from which the AAA+ modules hang (11). Crystal
structures are also available for the yeast RFC clamp loader
bound to an ATP analog and the clamp (21) and for two
archaeal RFC homotrimeric subcomplexes each of which
consists of three RFCS subunits and where four of the six
RFCS subunits are bound to ADP (22).
Mutational and biochemical studies have helped in inter-
preting these structural data and vice versa, resulting in a
fairly detailed model (Figure 1A) for the sequence of events
mediated by the g complex. For example, based on the struc-
ture of the d–b complex (20) it was proposed that, within the
full g complex, the d subunit induces conformational changes
at the b-clamp dimeric interface thereby triggering an inher-
ent spring-loaded mechanism in the b-clamp’s ring to open it.
This model is supported by biochemical studies indicating
that the d subunit alone can open and remove b clamps
from DNA nearly as efficiently as the g complex itself (7)
and that it does this by opening only one of the two
b-clamp monomeric interfaces (23), so that the opened b
ring retains its dimeric structure. Other studies reveal that
ATP binding increases affinity of the g complex for DNA
(24,25) and point to several residues within g and d0 subunits
likely involved in DNA binding (26). These studies also
reveal that the g complex uses ATP binding and hydrolysis
to modulate its interaction with DNA: the ATP-bound form
binds with high affinity to ordinary DNA whereas association
with elongation-proficient DNA preferentially triggers ATP
hydrolysis and conversion to a low-affinity state (27). Thus,
upon contact with cognate DNA the clamp loader–clamp
complex undergoes ATP hydrolysis resulting in closure of
the clamp around DNA [for reviews see (2,9,28,29)].
STATISTICAL INFERENCE OF CLAMP LOADER
FUNCTIONAL CONSTRAINTS
Previous studies raise additional questions regarding the
molecular and structural details associated with the bacterial
clamp loader mechanism. A critical question specifically
addressed here is how association of the g complex with
DNA activates ATP hydrolysis. Although further biochemical
and structural studies are required, of course, to answer this
question, designing such experiments is nontrivial and
requires that one first formulate feasible hypotheses through
preliminary observations. One such source of observations
is to apply Bayesian statistics to infer the various categories
of functional constraints imposed by underlying mechanisms
[(30,31) and references therein; recently reviewed in (32)].

Figure 1. Relevant features of the bacterial clamp loader complex and of g ATPase. (A) The sequence of events mediated by the g clamp loader [reviewed in
(53,54)]. The g complex consists of five semicircularly arranged subunits (1 d, 1 d0 and 3 g) that in the presence of ATP bind to and open the b clamp. Upon
association with RNA-primed DNA this complex undergoes ATP hydrolysis to load the clamp onto DNA. Each of these subunits contains three domains (I, II
and III); domains I and II correspond to an AAA+ module whereas domain III forms a collar holding the complex together. (B) Relevant structural regions within
the AAA+ module of g ATPase. Domain I, which is the focus of this article, is shown in blue. Also shown are three AAA+ catalytic residues (in light magenta):
the Walker A lysine (Lys51g), which forms hydrogen bonds with phosphate groups of bound ATP; the putative catalytic base (Glu127g) that follows the Walker
B motif and that is proposed to mediate nucleophilic attack by a water molecule on the g phosphate of ATP; and an arginine finger (Arg169g) that is proposed to
interact with and facilitate hydrolysis of ATP bound to an adjacent g subunit. (The d0 subunit, which contacts the ATP-binding site of the adjacent gD subunit,
also conserves this arginine finger.) Loop regions connected to the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of helix 4 are predicted to interact with DNA and with the b
clamp, respectively. The locations of adjacent g subunits (gB and gD) relative to the central subunit (gC) are indicated, along with three key residues discussed in
the text: His129 (yellow side-chain), Phe136 (light cyan) and Thr165 (light green). This structure corresponds to pdb code 1NJF (18). This figure was created
using RasMol (55).

vide valuable clues regarding the mechanistic roles of specific
residues.
Such an analysis of the eukaryotic RFC–clamp loader com-
plex (33) recently led to a number of hypotheses regarding its
underlying mechanism, including that (i) RFC ATPases are
activated upon interaction with DNA through a conforma-
tional switch where an arginine moves away from a position
in which it disrupts the conformation of key catalytic residues
and into the central hole of the clamp loader complex,
through which DNA is thread; (ii) residues uniquely
conserved within the RFC-A subunit trigger this Walker

B-arginine conformational switch upon contact with DNA;
(iii) the RFC-B, RFC-C and RFC-D subunits conserve resi-
dues involved in propagating this switch between adjacent
RFC ATPases; and (iv) a lysine interacting with the
C-terminal end of helix 4, which directly interacts with the
clamp, plays a key role in clamp binding, clamp release or
both [reviewed in (32)].
A similar analysis of constraints imposed on bacterial g
and d0 subunits (shown in Figure 2) reveals critical features
that strikingly diverge from those of corresponding euka-
ryotic RFC subunits and that suggest feasible hypotheses
regarding bacterial clamp loader mechanisms. Interpreting
these bacteria-specific features, however, requires that we
first consider the roles of several key residues in g that are
generally characteristic of AAA+ ATPases.
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF AAA+ ATPASES
Functional constraints that the g subunit shares with active
AAA+ ATPases are shown in Figure 2A. AAA+ ATPases
belong to the large superclass of sensor 1-like P loop
NTPases, which are characterized by three conserved motifs:
the Walker A and B motifs (14,34) followed by a third motif,
termed sensor 1 or motif C (35). The Walker A motif
(GxxxxGKT) consists of residues that bind to the phosphates
of ATP. The Walker B motif consists of a string of hydro-
phobic residues forming a b strand followed by an acidic res-
idue (Asp126g) that binds to the Mg2+ ion coordinating with
ATP. In AAA+ ATPases the sensor 1 region typically con-
serves an asparagine or threonine (Thr157g) that sometimes
forms a hydrogen bond with the g-phosphate of ATP and
thus can sense nucleotide binding or hydrolysis (17). In
other AAA+ ATPases sensor 1 residues contribute to a net-
work of hydrogen bonds positioning a water molecule near
the g-phosphate of ATP (36,37) presumably thereby facilitat-
ing nucleophilic attack (38).
AAA+ ATPases typically also conserve a putative ‘argin-
ine finger’ (39) (Arg169g) that appears to play a key role in
the hydrolysis of ATP bound to an adjacent AAA+ subunit
(2,11,29,40). The d0 subunit also conserves this arginine
(Arg158d0), which is predicted to interact with ATP bound
to the adjacent gD subunit. Mutational analysis of these
arginines (41) indicates that they also play a structural role
associated with the clamp loader’s affinity both for the b
clamp (the d0 arginine) and for DNA (the gD and gC
arginines).
KEY RESIDUES IN g INTERACTING WITH THE
PUTATIVE CATALYTIC BASE
Constraints distinguishing bacterial clamp loader ATPases
(g subunits) from catalytically inactive d0 subunits
(Figure 2D) are likely to conserve key residues involved in
coupling DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis to clamp loading.
Indeed two conserved residues in this category (Arg47g and
Thr52g) directly bind to ATP within g crystal structures
whereas another, the glutamate (Glu127g) directly following
the Walker B aspartate, plays a critical catalytic role. This
glutamate is likely to serve as the catalytic base facilitating
nucleophilic attack on the g-phosphate of ATP by an activated
water molecule, inasmuch as mutational and biochemical ana-
lysis indicated such a role for the equivalent residue in the
ABC transporter BmrA (42). Glu127g is structurally located
next to a highly conserved histidine (His129g in Figure 3A)
that also distinguishes g from d0 (Figure 2D). In many g crystal
structures, His129g appears to form a hydrogen bond with a
side-chain oxygen of the proposed catalytic glutamate
(Glu127g)—though whether this involves a strong –NH or
a weak –CH hydrogen bond cannot be determined from
the electron densities for these structures (but see below).
Eukaryotic and archaeal RFC–clamp loader ATPases lack
this histidine and instead conserve an acidic residue at this
position, as do many other AAA+ ATPases. This implies
that, in principle, this histidine is dispensable for the clamp
loading catalytic reaction. Conversely, bacterial g subunits
generally fail to conserve an arginine that appears essential
to the function of the corresponding RFC–clamp loaders
(Arg84RFC-B in Figure 3B). Within the RFC complex this
Figure 2. Statistical inference of selective constraints imposed on g and d0 ATPases. An alignment of domain I of g from distinct prokaryotic taxa (as indicated in
the leftmost column) is highlighted in four ways to reveal four distinct categories of constraints. Each alignment visualizes the degree to which conserved
residues in the ‘proteins-of-interest’ have diverged from a ‘reference group’ of proteins and thus reveals the change in selective pressure between these two
protein ‘functional states’ (32). Bayesian and other statistically based procedures were used to optimally align and define these two groups such that the proteins-
of-interest share a strikingly conserved pattern that is strikingly nonconserved in the reference group. [Application of these procedures—which is termed CHAIN
analysis (31)—involves various types of Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures (30) and modified versions of PSI-BLAST (56), as described previously (31).
The alignment procedures also rely on information derived from structural alignments (57) and from close examination of available crystal structures, as
described previously (58). For statistical details see (30,31) and references therein; for a recent review see (32).] Conserved patterns characteristic of the proteins-
of-interest are shown directly below each alignment with corresponding residue frequencies given in integer tenths below these patterns (an ‘8’ in integer tenths,
for example, indicates that the corresponding residue occurs in 80–90% of these sequences). Directly below this [in (B–D)] the patterns and residue frequencies
for the reference group are likewise shown. [Patterns and residue frequencies for the reference group in (A), which consists of all proteins, are not shown.]
Selective constraints are measured in terms of the number of random trials required to obtain the residues observed in the proteins-of-interest at each position by
randomly drawing from the distribution of residues in the reference group at that position. Aligned residue positions with compositions that closely resemble the
reference group will thus be found to have little or no selective constraints (because, in this case, few random trials are required), while residue positions with
compositions highly incompatible with the reference group will be found to have strong constraints (because many trials are required). Each alignment displays
this measure both explicitly in the histogram at the top (using a quasi-logarithmic scale) and qualitatively through highlighting of aligned residues. (A)

arginine appears to modulate DNA-dependent ATPase activ-
ity by undergoing a conformational change that moves it
away from disruptively interacting with backbone oxygens
on either side of the putative catalytic base (Glu115RFC-B)
and into contact with RNA-primed DNA thread through the
center of the clamp (33). Given that g subunits fail to con-
serve this arginine, bacterial clamp loaders presumably pos-
sess an alternative mechanism for DNA-dependent
regulation of ATPase activity. This alternative mechanism
could involve His129g.

conformational forms: one in which the plane of its aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to the plane of a nearby proline (Pro163) side-chain ring (colored cyan
and gray, respectively) (pdb code: 1NJFA) and another in which its aromatic ring is parallel to the proline ring (thin, light gray wireframe image) (pdb code:
1NJFB). The position of the proposed trans-acting catalytic threonine, Thr165, is also shown (colored light green) for these alternative forms. (B) Residues of
RFC-B (pdb code: 1SXJ) corresponding either to several of the conserved residues in (A) (light cyan side-chains) or to an DNA-dependent ATPase activation
mechanism (gray side-chains) proposed for RFC–clamp loaders (33). Note that main-chain oxygens on either side of the putative glutamate catalytic base
(E115RFC-B) (corresponding to E127g) form hydrogen bonds to a highly conserved arginine in RFC subunits (R84RFC-B) postulated to inactivate ATPase activity.
This arginine is very poorly conserved in bacterial g subunits. Similarly, corresponding RFC ATPases conserve a glutamine (Q124RFC-B) instead of Phe136g ,
which is conserved in g ATPases; this glutamine forms hydrogen bonds to loop regions preceding helices 5 and 6. (C) Conserved residues distinguishing g and d0
subunits from other AAA+ ATPases. Presumably because g and d0 both interact with an adjacent g subunit, many of these residues (light green side-chains) tend
to be located at this interface. Two highly conserved residues characteristic of all AAA+ ATPases (light magenta side-chains) also occur at this interface, namely
the AAA+ arginine finger (R169g) and a glutamate (E144g) that can form a salt bridge with this arginine.

Highly conserved histidines are often either associated
with catalytic roles or serve as controllable elements in
conformational changes (43). A possible function for
His129g is suggested by examining residues that, like
His129 itself, distinguish g from RFC subunits (Figure 2B)
and that thus may play mechanistic roles unique to g
ATPases. Within available crystal structures several of
these residues, namely Thr156g, Thr157g and Asp158g,
contact His129g (Figure 4A) and often the side chain of
Thr156g is positioned to form a hydrogen bond with
His129g and with the backbone NH-group of Asp158g
(Figure 4A). These two hydrogen bonds link His129g to the
sensor 1 threonine (Thr157g) that is located between
Thr156g and Asp158g and that also appears to form a
hydrogen bond with the putative catalytic base, Glu127g.
The side-chain oxygens of Asp158g are positioned to electro-
statically interact with the positive dipole moment created
by the backbone of the loop connecting it to Lys161g, a
residue implicated in DNA binding (26). (Unlike other
basic residues of g implicated in DNA binding, this lysine
is also highly conserved in corresponding RFC ATPases.)
Association of g with DNA thus could influence the con-
formation, not only of Lys161g, but also of Asp158g, given
the latter’s proximity to Lys161g and the fact that both g
and DNA backbone phosphates are negatively charged and
thus mutually repel.
HYPOTHETICAL DNA-DEPENDENT
REGULATORY MECHANISM INVOLVING His129
The interaction of His129g with the putative catalytic base,
Glu127g, and with these other residues and their proximity
to Lys161g suggests the following mechanism for DNA-
dependent ATPase activation.
Inactive form
In the absence of DNA, inhibition of g’s ATPase activity
could occur through protonation of one of His129g’s
side-chain nitrogens (Nd) via electron transfer beginning
with the peptide bond between Thr157g and Asp158g and
terminating in transfer of the side-chain –OH hydrogen of
Thr156g to His129g (Figure 5, right to left panels). This pro-
cess would result in full double-bond formation between the
main-chain nitrogen of Asp158g and the main-chain carbonyl
carbon of Thr157g—one of two peptide bond resonance
forms first proposed by Pauling et al. (44). The backbone
oxygen of Thr157g being solvent exposed might favor this
resonance form by allowing the resultant negative charge
on this oxygen to be stabilized by a solvent cation
(Figure 5, left panel). As a result, His129g would become
positively charged to form a salt bridge with the negatively
charged Glu127g. At the same time Thr157g stabilizes the
His129g–Glu127g salt bridge interaction by forming a
hydrogen bond with the side-chain oxygen of Glu127g
(Figures 4A and 5, left panel). The resultant redistribution
of negative charge within the glutamate side chain and its
repositioning prevents it from serving as a catalytic base for
ATP hydrolysis.
Active form
Association of the g clamp loader–ATP–clamp complex with
RNA-primed DNA is likely to induce conformational
changes in the loop containing Asp158g and Lys161g.
Because both of these residues interact with His129g, transi-
ent electrostatic interactions could favor electron transfer
through the –OH group of Thr156g to eliminate the positive
charge on His129g and to thereby disrupt the His129g–
Glu127g salt bridge (Figure 5, left to right). Upon release
of Glu127g, its side-chain electron density could be

for nucleophilic attack on g-phosphate through interactions with the catalytic base (E127) and with the trans-acting threonine (T165). This model is based on
RFC-A-to-RFC-B interactions within the RFC/ATP/clamp complex. Molecular modeling was performed using the KiNG program (http://kinemage.biochem.

redistributed—allowing it to serve as a catalytic base facilit-
ating attack by an activated water molecule on the g phos-
phate of ATP (Figure 5, right panel). (The hydrogen bonds
formed by Thr156g with the side-chain of His129g and with
the main-chain of Asp158g might also be eliminated—though
whether or not this occurs is unimportant to the proposed
mechanism.)
POTENTIALLY FLEXIBLE REGIONS
SURROUNDING His129
The nature of conserved residues distinguishing g ATPase
both from corresponding RFC ATPases and from inactive
d0 subunits (Figure 2B and D) supports the notion that g’s
underlying mechanism requires that regions surrounding
His129g be conformationally flexible.
Conformational flexibility of Met130
Consider, for example, a conserved methionine (Met130g)
that strikingly distinguishes g ATPases from inactive d0 sub-
units (Figure 2D). Methionine is conformationally flexible
(43) inasmuch as it is the only unbranched hydrophobic
amino acid and contains a side-chain sulphur atom, which
provides some hydrogen-bonding capability. Thus buried
regions required to undergo conformational changes might
be more likely to conserve a methionine than other, less
adaptable hydrophobic amino acids. Met130g is sequence
adjacent to and contacts His129g [perhaps forming a non-
bonded interaction with it (45)] and also contacts the putative
catalytic base, Glu127g, as well as two alanines within a
DAAS motif (position 94–97 in Figure 2B and D). The
DAAS motif structurally corresponds to an NASD motif
within RFC ATPases—the ATP- and ADP-bound forms of
which exhibit distinct conformations (33). Moreover, the
DAAS motif lies within the ‘pore loop’ of AAA+ ATPases:
a region that provides most of the surface of the central
pore (46), through which a number of AAA+ complexes
thread their substrates (13). Hence, this pore region is likely
to undergo conformational changes upon association with
RNA-primed DNA. The short side-chains of the DAAS-
motif alanines presumably are less restrictive than other
amino acid residues and thus could allow the Met130g side-
chain greater conformational freedom.
Conformational flexibility of Phe136
A conserved phenylalanine (Phe136g) that distinguishes g
both from d0 and from RFC ATPases (Figure 2D and B)
and that is located directly below the main-chain of
His129g similarly manifests flexibility inasmuch as it occurs
in two distinct conformational states (Figure 3A). Both of
these conformations are observed within crystal structures
of g either bound or unbound to an ATP analog—suggesting
that these alternative forms are not due to the mere presence
or absence of ATP.
Within corresponding RFC ATPases this phenylalanine
corresponds to a highly conserved glutamine (Q124RFC-B).
This glutamine forms characteristic hydrogen bonds
(Figure 3B) that are well conserved within various RFC sub-
units and that structurally couple regions implicated in DNA-
dependent activation with helices 5 and 6, which conserve
residues interacting (in trans) with the ATP-binding site of
an adjacent subunit (33). The existence of these hydrogen
bonds is supported by all nine currently available crystal
structure forms of eukaryotic and archaeal small RFC sub-
units, suggesting that this glutamine plays a critical structural
role in proper positioning of these regions. It is thus rather
surprising that this residue is replaced within g ATPases by
a conserved, conformationally flexible phenylalanine.
Phe136g, which is located in helix 5, establishes van der
Waals contact with a proline (Pro163g) that is near the
N-terminal end of helix 6 and that is conserved in
70–80% of bacterial g subunits. In one of g’s two confor-
mational forms the plane of the phenylalanine aromatic ring
is oriented perpendicular to the plane of Pro163’s side-chain
ring while in the other form it is parallel to the proline ring
(Figure 3A). The distances between the a carbons of
Figure 5. Proposed hypothetical clamp loader activation mechanism. Switching between inactive and active states occurs via an electron transfer chain involving
His129 and residues in the Sensor 1 region (Thr156, Thr157 and Asp158). In the inactive form (left panel), this results in a positive charge on His129, which
sequesters the catalytic base (Glu127) away from the g-phosphate of bound ATP. In the active form (right panel), the charge on His129 is neutralized, which
allows the catalytic base to hydrogen bond to and activate a water molecule for attack on the g-phosphorous atom of ATP. The water molecule is activated
through two proton extractions mediated by the side-chain oxygen of Glu127 and of a trans-interacting catalytic threonine (Thr165 in g or Thr154 in d0). For

Phe136g and Pro163g differ between these two forms by
2.5 A˚, indicating that the position of helix 5 relative to
helix 6 within g subunits significantly changes upon move-
ment of this phenylalanine. This contrasts with the apparently
rigid relative positioning of corresponding regions within
RFC subunits due to the hydrogen bonds formed by the
glutamine structurally corresponding to Phe136g (i.e.
Gln124RFC-B in Figure 3B). Moreover, the ATPase activity
of an adjacent g subunit seems likely to be modulated by
Phe136g-associated conformational changes, inasmuch as
these could reposition critical residues within helices 5 and
6 (Figure 3C) relative to the adjacent ATP-binding site.
ASSOCIATIONS WITH DNA-BINDING
RESIDUES IN g
Bacterial clamp loader g ATPases might diverge from corres-
ponding eukaryotic and archaeal RFC ATPases in these ways
due to a fundamentally different mode of DNA-dependent
activation. Indeed, basic residues in g experimentally implic-
ated in DNA binding (26), namely Arg98g, Lys100g, Arg133g
and Lys161g, are closely attached to regions harboring con-
served residues that distinguish g either from RFC ATPases,
from d0 or from both. Arg98g and Lys100g (both of which are
poorly conserved) directly follow the DAAS motif (though
only Arg98g is shown in Figure 3A). Arg133g (which like-
wise is only weakly conserved) is situated between His129g
and Phe136g (Figure 3A). And Lys161g (which is highly
conserved in both g and RFC ATPases) is within the loop
connecting the Sensor 1 region (harboring residues 156–
158) to helix 6 (harboring Thr165g, a putative trans-acting
catalytic residue discussed at length below).
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ADJACENT
g SUBUNITS
ATP hydrolysis by AAA+ ATPases is believed to require
interaction with a trans-acting arginine finger donated by an
adjacent AAA+ subunit and, in the case of g ATPase, perhaps
with additional trans-acting residues mediating either cata-
lysis itself or proper subunit-to-subunit positioning upon
binding of the complex to the clamp and to DNA. Such
residues are likely subject to constraints distinguishing both
g and d0 from other AAA+ proteins (Figure 2C) inasmuch
as d0 interacts with the adjacent gD subunit’s ATP site in a
manner similar to interaction of gD or gC with the adjacent
g subunit’s ATP site (Figure 1A). As expected, most residues
subject to these constraints occur at the subunit-to-subunit
interface shared by g and d0 (Figure 3C), which corresponds
to helices 4, 5 and 6.
Exploring what these constraints imply mechanistically is
hindered somewhat in that currently available structures of
the g complex (11,19) correspond to inactive states and
were determined in the absence of the clamp and of DNA.
As a result, the interactions between critical residues
observed in these structures might be mechanistically mean-
ingless, and, indeed, the d, gB, gC, gD and d0 subunits within
these complexes appear to be orientated rather haphazardly
relative to each other. Thus, to help interpret these functional
constraints, structural models of the ATP-bound form of the
g complex bound to the clamp were constructed based on
structural analogy to related RFC subunits within the RFC–
ATP–clamp complex (21). [The highly conserved arginine
finger (Arg169g) and acidic residue (Glu144g) in helices
6 and 5, respectively, can help guide geometrically precise
positioning of these helices relative to the adjacent ATP
site.] In particular, because the interaction between the
RFC-A and RFC-B subunits appears poised for action (21),
these were used to model the interaction between g subunits
shown in Figure 4B.
A CRITICAL CATALYTIC ROLE FOR Thr165
By far the strongest constraint associated with interactions
between adjacent g subunits (Figure 2C) is imposed on a
conserved threonine (Thr165g; Thr154d
0
), which (based on
modeling) can form a hydrogen bond with and thereby help
properly position a water molecule for nucleophilic attack
on the g phosphate of ATP (Figures 4B and 5, right panel).
Moreover, Thr165g might also assist the catalytic base
(Glu127g) by forming an –OH hydrogen bond with a g-
phosphate oxygen atom, thereby setting up an electron trans-
fer network leading to the extraction of a proton from and
thereby activating the nearby water molecule for nucleophilic
attack (Figure 5, right panel). Incidentally, this arrangement
ensures that catalysis occurs only after the interface with
helices 5 and 6 of the adjacent g or d0 subunit is properly
oriented, which presumably would only be true once the g
complex is bound to the clamp and to RNA-primed DNA.
Other residues subject to constraints distinguishing g from
corresponding RFC subunits (Figure 2B) might assist
Thr165g in this putative catalytic role. For example, within
the available crystal structures of the g subunit, Leu140g
packs against both Thr165g and the AAA+ arginine finger
(Arg169g) (Figure 4B), suggesting that its role is to properly
position these residues for catalysis. Similarly, modeling of
g-to-g subunit interactions indicates that Lys141g, which is
next to Leu140g in the sequence, is likely to interact electro-
statically with two conserved acidic residues: one being the
Walker B motif aspartate and another near the pore loop
(Asp126g and Asp94g in Figure 4B, respectively). Within
the RFC ATPases, the pore loop is characterized by an
NxSD motif that manifests two distinct conformations pro-
posed to correspond to active and inactive states (33).
Although bacterial g and d0 subunits lack this NxSD motif,
they conserve an alternative DxAS motif at the corresponding
pore loop positions (Figure 2B and C). Electrostatic inter-
actions involving Lys141g might help couple positioning of
the pore loop and the Walker B regions to the trans-acting
catalytic residues (i.e. Arg169g and Thr165g) and thus per-
haps help couple sensing of cognate DNA to ATP hydrolysis.
ARG47 AS A SECOND, CIS-ACTING
ARGININE FINGER
Thr165g corresponds to a proline residue within the RFC-B
subunit (Pro153RFC-B). This proline contacts another proline
(Pro355RFC-A) within the adjacent RFC-A subunit—a residue
corresponding to Arg47g. Arg47g is specifically conserved
within g (Figure 2B and D) and is positioned to form a

hydrogen bond with the g phosphate of ATP (Figure 4) and,
in fact, does so in several of the available crystal structures.
Why does the g subunit conserve an arginine (Arg47g) at a
position corresponding to a conserved proline within RFC
subunits? An answer is suggested by comparison with the
RFC–clamp–ATP complex, for which an arginine
(Arg128RFC-B)—that is conserved in RFC subunits, but not
in the corresponding g and d0 subunits—forms a hydrogen
bond (in trans) to the g phosphate of ATP bound to an adja-
cent subunit (21). Hence, RFC subunits donate two arginine
fingers in trans to the adjacent ATP-binding site: the arginine
finger that is generally shared by all AAA+ ATPases
(e.g. Arg157RFC-B corresponding to Arg169g) and this addi-
tional arginine finger, which is conserved only in small
RFC subunits (e.g. Arg128RFC-B). However, within the g
complex this second trans-acting RFC-specific arginine fin-
ger appears to be functionally replaced by a cis-acting argin-
ine unique to g subunits, namely Arg47g—a change that may
be required to complete the catalytic role of Thr165g (or
Thr154 in d0), with which Arg47g is predicted to interact.
In particular, hydrogen bond formation between g-phosphate
oxygen atoms and Arg47g (as well as with Arg169g) could
help draw electrons away from the g phosphorous atom
(especially given arginine’s positive charge) and thereby
make it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by an activ-
ated water molecule.
Arg47g occupies the third position of the Walker A or P
loop motif (GxRxxGKT, where this position is bold and
underlined), and several studies using vanadate as a transition
state analog of phosphate indicate that in P loop NTPases the
g phosphate of ATP in the transition state is near the corres-
ponding residue at this position. These include Ser180 in
myosin (GxSxxGKT) (47), Pro17 in adenylate kinase
(GxPxxGKgT) (48) and Ala158 in ATP synthase
(GxAxxGKT) (49). A more recent study (50) indicates that,
in the transition state of ATP synthase, Mg2+ plays a key
role in repositioning of the P loop to bring this third Walker
A residue (Ala158ATP_synthase) into the catalytic pocket. This
raises the possibility that Arg47g undergoes a similar reposi-
tioning in the transition state of the g subunit and thus further
supports an important role for it in ATP hydrolysis and per-
haps in nucleotide exchange. Incidentally, AAA+ modules
within the Mg2+ chelatase BchI subunit (51) and within the
BCS1 protein involved in biogenesis of mitochondrial respir-
atory chain complexes (52) also conserve an arginine at this
third Walker A position.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The similarities and differences in selective constraints
imposed on various bacterial, eukaryotic and archaeal
clamp loader subunits reflect similarities and differences in
their underlying mechanisms. Examining these constraints
in light of clamp loader structures can suggest feasible hypo-
theses regarding these mechanisms. Here this has led to the
hypothesis that bacterial clamp loader ATPases are activated
through DNA-dependent repositioning both of the catalytic
base and of a trans-acting catalytic threonine donated by an
adjacent g or d0 subunit. To test this hypothesis, mutagenesis
experiments can be devised where a critical residue is
replaced by the corresponding residue observed in related
AAA+ ATPases or by an amino acid that—though unlikely
to introduce structural perturbations—is inconsistent with
the proposed mechanism. For example, mutating Thr165 to
valine would merely replace its side-chain oxygen with a car-
bon and thereby would be predicted to eliminate catalysis
without significantly perturbing other structural features of
the g complex. Similar substitutions might include R47P,
H129D, M130L, F136Q, T156C, T156S and T157N. This
and similar analyses of other AAA+ ATPases—such as
RuvB, which likewise harbors a histidine and sensor 1 threon-
ine capable of similar interactions with the putative catalytic
base—should provide insight into the general mechanisms
of the AAA+ class of molecular chaperones and into their
functional divergence during evolution.
