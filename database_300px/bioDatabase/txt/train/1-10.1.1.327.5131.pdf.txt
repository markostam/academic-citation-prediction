Abstract
The transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) signaling pathway
has an important role in regulating normal prostate epithe-
lium, inhibiting proliferation, differentiation, and both
androgen deprivation–induced and androgen-independent
apoptosis. During prostate cancer formation, most prostate
cancer cells become resistant to these homeostatic effects of
TGF-B. Although the loss of expression of either the type I
(TBRI) or type II (TBRII) TGF-B receptor has been documented
in f30% of prostate cancers, most prostate cancers become
TGF-B resistant without mutation or deletion of TBRI, TBRII,
or Smads2, 3, and 4, and thus, the mechanism of resistance
remains to be defined. Here, we show that type III TGF-B
receptor (TBRIII or betaglycan) expression is decreased or lost
in the majority of human prostate cancers as compared with
benign prostate tissue at both the mRNA and protein level.
Loss of TBRIII expression correlates with advancing tumor
stage and a higher probability of prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) recurrence, suggesting a role in prostate cancer
progression. The loss of TBRIII expression is mediated by
the loss of heterozygosity at the TGFBR3 genomic locus and
epigenetic regulation of the TBRIII promoter. Functionally,
restoring TBRIII expression in prostate cancer cells potently
decreases cell motility and cell invasion through Matrigel
in vitro and prostate tumorigenicity in vivo. Taken together,
these studies define the loss of TBRIII expression as a common
event in human prostate cancer and suggest that this loss is
important for prostate cancer progression through effects on
cell motility, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) is a ubiquitous, pleiotro-
pic growth factor that regulates many cell processes including cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1–4). There are three
TGF-h isoforms, TGF-h1, TGF-h2, and TGF-h3, that exert their
cellular effects by binding to cell surface receptors, the type I
(ThRI), type II (ThRII), and type III (ThRIII) TGF-h receptors (5, 6).
ThRII is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase that, upon
ligand binding, recruits and phosphorylates ThRI to stimulate its
serine/threonine kinase activity. ThRI then phosphorylates and
activates the transcription factors Smad2 or Smad3, which form a
complex with Smad4, that translocates to the nucleus to initiate
transcription of TGF-h target genes in a cell-specific manner.
ThRIII, also known as betaglycan, is a 849-amino-acid proteo-
glycan with a short 41-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain (7, 8).
ThRIII is the most abundantly expressed TGF-h receptor and binds
all three TGF-h isoforms with high affinity. Due to its structural
characteristics and lack of obvious signaling motifs, ThRIII was
originally thought to function primarily as a TGF-h coreceptor,
serving to sequester and present ligand to ThRII (7–9), with
ectodomain shedding producing a soluble extracellular domain
(sThRIII) that antagonizes TGF-h signaling (10). This assumption
has been challenged by recent studies demonstrating that mice
lacking ThRIII die at gestational day 13.5 due to defects in the heart
and liver (11), and that blocking TGF-h2 binding specifically to
ThRIII inhibits TGF-h2–induced mesenchymal transformation in
chick embryonic hearts (12). Recent studies have also expanded the
role of ThRIII in mediating/regulating TGF-h signaling through its
short, but highly conserved cytoplasmic domain. Although the
cytoplasmic domain of ThRIII is not required for ligand
presentation, this domain is required for full promotion of TGF-h
signaling (13). ThRIII interacts through this cytoplasmic domain
with the scaffolding proteins Ga-interacting protein, C terminus
(14), and h-arrestin 2 (15), as well as with the autophosphorylated,
active form of ThRII (13). The interaction of ThRIII and ThRII
results in the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of ThRIII
by ThRII, mediating the binding of h-arrestin 2 to ThRIII and
potentially the disassociation of ThRIII from ThRII (13). Whereas
Ga-interacting protein, C terminus, binding stabilizes ThRIII on
the cell surface to increase TGF-h responsiveness (14), h-arrestin 2
binding results in the internalization of both ThRIII and ThRII and
down-regulation of TGF-h signaling (15).
The TGF-h signaling pathway has an important role in
regulating normal prostate epithelium, inhibiting proliferation,
differentiation, and both androgen deprivation–induced and
androgen-independent apoptosis (16–18). During prostate cancer
formation, as in other cancers, prostate cancer cells become
resistant to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-h (19). Although the
loss of expression of either ThRI or ThRII has been documented in
31% of prostate cancers (20–22), most prostate cancers become
resistant to the homeostatic effects of TGF-h without mutation or
deletion of ThRI, ThRII, or Smads2, 3, and 4. Thus, other
mechanisms must enable prostate cancer cells to escape the
tumor-suppressive properties of TGF-h. Recently, loss of ThRIII
expression has been reported in renal cell carcinoma (23) and
endometrial cancer (24). Moreover, exogenous administration of
sThRIII suppresses tumorigenicity in vivo (25–27). Given that
ThRIII has emerging roles in mediating and regulating TGF-h
signaling, and the expression and functional significance of ThRIII

whether the loss of ThRIII expression is a mechanism through
which prostate cancer cells escape the tumor-suppressive effects of
TGF-h.
Materials and Methods
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical studies were done on
paraffin sections provided by the Duke University Research Foundation and
the Cooperative Prostate Cancer Tissue Resource Prostate Tissue Micro-
array (TMA 2 Gleason). Before analyzing the prostate tissue microarray, the
purified ThRIII-specific antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was tested at
various dilutions with prostate cancer specimens obtained from the Duke
Tissue Bank to identify the optimal antibody concentration required for
reproducible immunohistochemical staining with minimum background.
Consecutive tumor sections with the primary antibody substituted with a
normal rabbit immunoglobulin G served as negative controls. All paraffin
sections were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated by immersing in
increasing dilutions of ethanol (100–70%) followed by distilled water. The
samples were then immersed in 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30 min to
block the endogenous peroxidase activity. Nonspecific binding from serum
components was blocked by covering samples in 10% normal goat serum
diluted in PBS-Brij solution (625 AL 30% Brij in 1 L PBS) for 1 h. Samples
were then blocked using an avidin-biotin blocking kit (Vector, Burlingame,
CA). ThRIII-specific antibodies were diluted in 10% normal goat serum in
PBS-Brij solution and applied at a concentration of 1:200 overnight at 4jC.
After the overnight incubation with the primary antibody, the samples were
immersed thrice in PBS-Brij solution for 5 min each. The samples were then
probed with the secondary antibody (biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglo-
bulin G) at a concentration of 1:100 at room temperature for 1 h. Samples
were then incubated with Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector) for 30 min at
room temperature. Samples were washed between each incubation using a
PBS-Brij solution (625 AL 30% Brij in 1 L PBS). Reactivity was visualized with
an avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase system using diaminobenzi-
dine as the chromagen and Mayer’s hematoxylin as the counterstain
(Vector). All slides were reviewed independently by two investigators
(R. Turley and E. C. Finger) who were blinded to clinical and pathologic data
and reconfirmed by a second set of evaluations by a board-certified
pathologist (T. Fields) blinded to the interpretations of the first set of
evaluations. Immunostaining results were compared, and discrepancies
were reviewed. There was significant agreement between the three observers
(99.6% correspondence); thus, the pathologist’s scores are presented.
Oncomine microarray data and meta-analysis. Six independent gene
profiling studies (28–33) publicly available on the Oncomine Cancer
Profiling Database4 were used to investigate ThRIII mRNA levels in prostate
cancer. For each study, the mean ThRIII expression and the SD for both
tumor and normal prostate tissue were calculated. Using the statistical
program, Comprehensive Meta-analysis (Biostat, Inc., Englewood, NJ), the
standard difference in means between the normal and tumor ThRIII from
the mean ThRIII expression, the SD, and sample number for each individual
study were calculated, and the combined meta-analysis of all six studies,
along with each 95% confidence interval, was plotted. A negative value
indicates a decrease in ThRIII expression in tumor versus normal.
Cell culture and reagents. DU145 cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). DU145 cells were
maintained in modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FCS and
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Cells were kept incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2.
Stable cell line formation. DU145 cells were plated in six-well plates
and grown to 80% confluency. Regular cell media was then replaced with
Opti-MEM for transfection. In three wells of the six-well plate, 2 Ag full-
length, hemagglutinin-tagged rat ThRIII was transfected with 4 AL
LipofectAMINE 2000 following the manufacturer’s protocol. The empty
vector pcDNA3.1 was transfected in the other three wells in the same
fashion of ThRIII. The cells were incubated in the Opti-MEM containing the
DNA and LipofectAMINE 2000 for 4 h, then the media was changed back to
each cell line’s regular media. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized, pooled, and
replated in a 75-cm2 flask. Selection was started by supplementing cell
media with 500 Ag/mL G418 72 h after transfection. Cells were selected for
4 weeks until the flask becomes 100% confluent with G418-resistant stables.
After five passages, ThRIII expression was confirmed with affinity labeling.
DU145 cells stably expressing full-length ThRIII and the empty vector
pcDNA3.1 were maintained by supplementing their media with 500 Ag/mL
G418.
Affinity labeling. Cells were labeled with 100 pmol/L 125I-TGFh1 in
Krebs-Ringer-HEPES [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 130 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L MgSO4, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 5 mmol/L KCl] plus 0.5% bovine serum
albumin for 3 h at 4jC. Cells were rinsed with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES four
times, then surface proteins were cross-linked with 0.5 mg/mL disuccini-
midyl suberate for 15 min. The reaction was quenched by incubating with
20 mmol/L glycine for 10 min. Cells were again rinsed with Krebs-Ringer-
HEPES, and then lysed in 100 AL 2 sample buffer. Proteins were resolved
on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and detected by a phosphoimager.
Proliferation studies. Twenty thousand DU145 cells stably expressing
the empty vector pcDNA3.1 or ThRIII were plated in triplicate in six-well
plates and grown at 37jC in 5% CO2. Cells were counted in triplicate using a
Coulter counter every 24 h for 6 days. New media supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum was added to plates every 48 h. About 100 pmol/L TGF-h
treatment (or media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) was added
to select samples every 48 h. Cells were counted in triplicate using a Coulter
counter every 24 h.
DNA extraction. Eight different patient prostate tumor samples and
eight matched patient normal prostate tissue were obtained from the Duke
Tissue Resource Network. Each sample was paraffin embedded and
mounted on glass microscope slides. The samples were deparaffinized by
immersion in xylene. The tumor tissue was lifted with a scalpel blade,
transferred into a microfuge tube, and digested overnight at 65jC in buffer
containing proteinase K. The lysate was heated at 95jC for 10 min to
inactivate proteinase K. Lysate volumes sufficient to provide 4 Ag genomic
DNA was used directly for PCR. Control DNA was obtained by digesting
matched normal prostate tissue.
Microsatellite PCR loss of heterozygosity analysis. Genomic DNA
extracted from human prostate cancer specimens and matching normal
prostate tissue was kindly provided by the Duke Prostate Cancer Tissue
Bank. Microsatellite markers, D1S1588, D1S2804, and D1S435, were used in
PCR reactions in which the forward primer was synthesized with a 5¶
fluorescent tag (Integrated DNA Technology, Inc., Coralville, IA). PCR
products were visualized using an ABI sequencer, and data was analyzed
using GeneScan software. To determine the loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a
ratio for each normal sample was calculated by dividing the total area
calculated by the GeneScan software under the first peak by the total area
under the second peak. The ratio of the peak areas for the tumor sample
was calculated in the same fashion. Finally, the peak-area ratio for the
normal prostate tissue was divided by the peak-area ratio for the tumor
tissue. Criteria for LOH was a ratio >1.5 or <0.67.
Methylation and histone acetylation analysis. Prostate cancer cell
lines DU145 and PC3 were treated with either 10 Amol/L 5-aza-2-
deoxycytidine for 96 h and/or 500 nmol/L trichostatin A (TSA) for 24 h or
with vehicle (no treatment). RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and reverse transcribed. Quantitative SYBR Green real-time
reverse transcription-PCR was done using ThRIII-specific or control
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers. Data were normalized
against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels and expressed
relative to basal levels of ThRIII message levels from cell lines without
treatment.
Wound-healing assay. DU145 cells were plated to confluence in six-well
plates and scratched with a p200 tip to cause a wound. Images were taken
using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope under 10 magnification at
multiple time points from 0 to 24 h. Cells were maintained in their selection
media at 37jC in 5% CO2 during this time period. The percent of the wound4 http://www.oncomine.org

remaining open F SEM was calculated using Adobe Photoshop, with the
0-h time point being set to 100% for each sample type.
Fibronectin motility assay. A total of 50,000 DU145 cells stably
expressing the empty vector pcDNA3.1 or ThRIII were seeded in serum-free
media + 500 Ag/mL G418 F 150 pmol/L TGF-h1 in the upper chamber of
fibronectin-coated transwell filters. The lower chamber was loaded
with regular media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After a
24-h incubation at 37jC in 5% CO2, the tops of the filters were scrapped,
and cells that migrated through the fibronectin were fixed and stained using
3 Step Stain Set (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Cells that
migrated to the lower surface of the membrane were counted in three fields
under 10 magnification.
Matrigel invasion assay. Matrigel invasion chambers were purchased
from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). The BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion
chambers included Falcon Cell Culture inserts containing an 8-Am pore size
PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix.
DU145 cells lines (25,000–50,000 cells per well) were resuspended in 500 AL
serum-free media with 500 Ag/mL G418 F 150 pmol/L TGF-h1 and then
seeded onto the upper compartment of each chamber. The lower
compartment was filled with 700 AL of medium containing normal serum
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 Ag/mL G418. The chambers were then
incubated for 48 h at 37jC. Noninvading cells were removed from the upper
surface of the filter, and cells that had migrated through the filter were fixed
and stained using the 3 Step Stain Set (Richard-Allan Scientific). Filters were
allowed to dry and then were mounted onto a normal microscope slide.
Cells that migrated to the lower surface of the filter were considered to have
invaded through the overlying matrix and were counted in three fields using
light microscopy.
Human prostate cancer xenograft model. Animal procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke
University. A total of 1  106 DU145-Neo or DU145-RIII cells were injected
s.c. into both flanks of athymic BALB/cAnNCr-nu/nu mice. The DU145-Neo
group contained six mice, and the DU145-RIII contained five mice. Mice
were weighed, and tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured every
3 days. Tumor volume was approximated using the formula V = 0.5 L W2.
Tumor volume was followed for 36 days when some of the mice were
reaching humane end points, at which time the mice were sacrificed. Upon
autopsy, tumors were excised and weighed.
Results
Decreased TBRIII expression in prostate cancer. To assess a
large number of prostate cancer specimens simultaneously, we did
immunohistochemical analysis for ThRIII expression on a prostate
cancer tissue array specifically designed to define grade-specific
markers for prostate cancer. The prostate cancer tissue array
contains prostate cancer tissue cores obtained from radical
prostatectomy specimens from 250 patients (mean age, 63), with
3 cases of Gleason 4, 31 cases of Gleason 5, 53 cases of Gleason 6, 54
cases of Gleason 7, 52 cases of Gleason 8, 54 cases of Gleason 9, and
2 cases of Gleason 10. There are also 48 cases of separately
represented high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN)
cores (mean age, 63) from among these 250 patients and 32
samples of control non-neoplastic tissue [18 benign prostatic
hyperplasia cases (mean age, 63) obtained from radical retropubic
prostatectomy and 14 organ donor prostates (mean age, 71)].
Organ donor prostates were obtained during total organ harvest,
perfused until the time of donor kidney removal, with the donor
prostate tissue immediately transported and fixed in a similar
fashion to the radical prostatectomy specimens. Additional data
available for these cases included age at diagnosis, PSA at
diagnosis, tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis stage, time to
recurrence, and vital status. ThRIII staining for each core prostate
tissue sample was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 by three independent
observers, including a board-certified pathologist, where a score of
0 corresponds to absent staining, 0.5 corresponds to trace staining,
1 corresponds to low levels of staining, 2 corresponds to medium
levels of staining, and 3 corresponds to high levels of staining.
Either prostatic epithelium or tumor was graded for each core,
with emphasis not to include staining of stromal or smooth muscle
elements that usually stained intensely for ThRIII (data not
shown). ThRIII expression decreased progressively from non-
neoplastic prostate tissue (Fig. 1A, B, E , and F) to HGPIN (Fig. 1C,
E , and F) to invasive prostate cancer (Fig. 1D–F) with the
proportion with abundant ThRIII expression decreasing from 91%
in control non-neoplastic prostate tissue to 53.2% in HGPIN to
27.8% in invasive prostate cancer (Fig. 1E ; P = 0.0019, two-tailed
Fisher’s exact probability test). In contrast, the proportion with
little to no ThRIII expression increased from 0% in control non-
neoplastic prostate tissue to 22.6% in HGPIN to 45% in invasive
prostate cancer (Fig. 1E ; P = 0.0019, two-tailed Fisher’s exact
probability test). The mean immunohistochemistry ThRIII score
also decreased from 2.85 F 0.08 for control non-neoplastic prostate
tissue to 2.27 F 0.11 for HGPIN to 1.79 F 0.06 for prostate cancer
(Fig. 1F ; P value <0.0001, ANOVA).
Figure 1. Decreased ThRIII expression in prostate cancer. A to D, a prostate
cancer tissue array containing samples from 342 patients was stained with a
ThRIII-specific antibody, and immunohistochemical (IHC ) staining was scored
on a 0 to 3 scale by a board-certified pathologist, 0 corresponding to no staining
and 3 representing high levels of staining. Representative staining of
non-neoplastic prostate tissue scored as 3 (A), benign prostatic hyperplasia
scored as 3 (B), HGPIN scored as 2 (C ), and invasive prostate cancer scored as
0 (D ). E to F, IHC staining scores of non-neoplastic prostate tissue and BPH

versus low staining in each sample type, as well as the mean ThRIII IHC

To evaluate whether progressive loss of ThRIII expression
occurred in matched patient specimens, we analyzed the 48
specimens with matched HGPIN and invasive prostate cancer from
the same patient. A total of 22 of the 48 (46%) patient-matched sets
showed a decrease in ThRIII expression from HGPIN to invasive
prostate cancer, whereas only 8 of the 48 (17%) showed an increase
in ThRIII expression (Fig. 1G and H). Seven of the 18 (39%)
remaining specimens exhibiting no change in ThRIII expression
already exhibited little to no expression in the HGPIN specimen.
The mean immunohistochemistry ThRIII score also decreased
from 2.24 F 0.14 for HGPIN to 1.78 F 0.14 for prostate cancer in
these matched patient specimens (P = 0.021, two-tailed indepen-
dent t test). These data indicate that ThRIII expression was
significantly decreased in prostate cancer, with loss of ThRIII
expression correlating with prostate cancer progression.
We also analyzed correlations of our mean immunohistochem-
istry ThRIII score with clinical stage, primary Gleason grade of the
core, and total Gleason score of the prostate tumor. Although there
was no correlation between immunohistochemistry ThRIII score
and total Gleason score or primary Gleason grade (data not
shown), there was a trend for decreased ThRIII expression between
clinical T stages 2 and 3 (Fig. 1G ; P = 0.0546). Clinical stages 1 and
4 were omitted due to insufficient sample number. These data
suggest that the loss of ThRIII expression is a rather early event in
prostate cancer progression, with loss beginning during the
formation of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and increasing
as these progress to invasive prostate cancer.
We then investigated whether there was also a loss of ThRIII
expression at the mRNA level. Using six previously published gene
profiling studies for benign prostate and prostate cancer specimens
publicly available through the Gene Expression Omnibus repository
and Oncomine Gene Profiling Databases, we established that the
mean ThRIII mRNA levels were significantly decreased in prostate
tumor tissue as compared with normal prostate tissue in all six
studies (Fig. 2A). Because ThRIII expression is high in the stroma,
this decrease could potentially be due to a decrease in stromal
contribution to the mRNA expression in tumor versus benign
specimens. However, one of these studies, Yu et al. (30), used only
normal peripheral zone prostate tissue with at least 60% glandular
components and tumor tissues with at least 70% tumor, and
another study, Lapointe et al. (31), found very few genes in
which expression correlated with epithelial content, making this

explanation less likely. Moreover, combining all six studies in a
meta-analysis, we calculated the combined standard difference in
means to be 1.855 F 0.140 (95% confidence interval, 2.218 to
1.581; P < 0.001; Fig. 2B), confirming the loss of ThRIII expression
in prostate cancer as compared with benign prostate.
In four of the six gene profiling studies, relative ThRIII mRNA
expression was available for metastases as well as the primary
tumors. In all four studies, ThRIII mRNA was further decreased in
metastases as compared with the primary tumor. A meta-analysis
of all four studies resulted in a standard difference in means
between primary prostate cancers and metastases to be 0.814 F
0.152 (95% confidence interval, 1.112 to 0.515; P < 0.001;
Fig. 2C), supporting further loss of ThRIII expression in metastatic
disease.
Analysis of data from Lapointe et al. (31) also confirmed a
statistically significant decrease in ThRIII mRNA levels in clinical
stage T3 as compared with clinical stage T2 (P = 0.0339; Fig. 2D)
and established a decrease in ThRIII mRNA levels in patients with
known PSA recurrence relative to those who did not have PSA
recurrence (P = 0.0062; Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results show
that ThRIII expression is decreased in prostate cancer at both the
message and protein level, with decreased expression correlating
with increasing clinical stage, metastatic disease, and PSA
recurrence, but not Gleason score or grade.

whether LOH represents a mechanism for decreased ThRIII
expression in human prostate cancer, we did a preliminary study
using PCR-based LOH analysis on eight patient prostate cancer
specimens with matching normal adjacent prostate tissue using
three microsatellite markers (D1S1588, D1S2804, and D1S435) that
are informative for the TGFBR3 genomic locus at 1p32. Using these
three microsatellite markers, we were able to establish that 37.5%
(3:8) of our samples showed LOH at the TGFBR3 locus (Fig. 3A
and B). In addition, by examining ThRIII expression by immuno-
histochemistry in these specimens, we were able to confirm that
the loss of ThRIII expression correlated with LOH in all three cases
(Fig. 3C and D). Thus, these studies confirm that LOH of the
TGFBR3 locus is one mechanism through which ThRIII expression
is lost during prostate cancer progression.
Because only 37.5% of the samples in this preliminary LOH
analysis showed loss of allelic DNA as a mechanism for decreased
ThRIII expression, we investigated other mechanisms through
which ThRIII might be down-regulated at the mRNA level. Epige-
netic regulation via promoter hypermethylation and/or histone
acetylation is another potential mechanism to account for the
decreased ThRIII mRNA levels in prostate cancer. To test whether
epigenetic regulation of ThRIII could be involved in prostate
cancer, we treated the prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145
cells, with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine
and/or the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA. PC-3 cells, derived
from a bone metastasis from a stage IV adenocarcinoma of the
prostate, express high endogenous levels of ThRIII, whereas DU145
cells, derived from a brain metastasis from a patient with
adenocarcinoma of the prostate, express very low levels of ThRIII.
RIII. 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine and TSA treatment induced the
expression of ThRIII in the DU145 cells with low basal ThRIII
expression 6-fold, while having no significant effect on the PC3
cells with high basal ThRIII expression (Fig. 3E). These studies
suggest that ThRIII expression may be decreased in prostate cancer
not only through the loss of the TGFBR3 genomic locus, but also
though epigenetic silencing.
TBRIII does not alter prostate cancer cell proliferation. To
explore the functional significance of ThRIII in prostate cancer, we
analyzed TGF-h receptor expression in the PC-3 and DU145
prostate cancer cells lines and the immortalized prostate epithelial
cells LHS and LHSR (35). The LHS and LHSR cells were
immortalized by infecting prostate epithelial cells with retroviruses
expressing LT, hTERT, and ST and SV40 LT, hTERT, ST, and H-ras ,
respectively (35). Both LHS and LHSR cells expressed high levels of
ThRIII, suggesting that prostate epithelial cells normally express
high levels of ThRIII (data not shown). Although the PC-3 cell line
also expressed high-level ThRIII, the DU145 prostate cell line
expressed low levels of ThRIII and relatively normal levels of ThRII
and ThRI (Supplementary Fig. S1A , data not shown). Thus, we
chose the DU145 cell line to investigate the functional consequen-
ces of the loss of ThRIII expression. We established a DU145 stable
cell line re-expressing ThRIII (DU145-RIII) and a control DU145 cell
line expressing empty vector, pcDNA3.1 (DU145-Neo). Expression
of ThRIII was verified by performing 125I-TGFh1 binding and
cross-linking studies, with DU145-RIII expressing all three TGF-h
receptors and DU145-Neo cells expressing very low levels of
ThRIII (Supplemental Fig. S1A). ThRII and ThRI levels were
equivalent in both DU145-RIII and DU145-Neo cells. We then tested
whether ThRIII effects cell proliferation in the presence and
absence of TGFh1. Exogenous expression of ThRIII had no effect
on basal DU145 cell proliferation because the growth curves of
DU145-Neo and DU145-RIII were similar (Supplemental Fig. S1B).
In addition, in the presence of 100 pmol/L TGFh1, exogenous
expression of ThRIII had no effect on TGFh1-regulated DU145 cell

proliferation because, again, the growth curves of DU145-Neo and
DU145-RIII were similar (Supplemental Fig. S1C). These results
show that expression of ThRIII had no effect on cellular
proliferation in vitro and did not alter responsiveness to TGFh1
in the DU145 cell line.
TBRIII decreases prostate cancer cell migration. The
decrease in ThRIII expression in prostate cancer relative to benign
prostate and in higher stage and metastatic prostate cancers
relative to lower stage and nonmetastatic prostate cancers all
suggested a potential role for ThRIII in regulating cell migration
and/or invasion. To examine the role of ThRIII in regulating cell
migration, we first used a monolayer wound-healing assay and
monitored wound closure over a 24-h time course (36). DU145
prostate cancer cells stably expressing ThRIII consistently
migrated slower than control DU145-Neo cells (Fig. 4A and B).
Although wounds in DU145-Neo cells closed completely by 24 h,
wounds in confluent DU145-RIII cells remained 32.7 F 3.7% open
at 24 h (Fig. 4A and B). These studies suggested that expression of
ThRIII was sufficient to inhibit cellular migration.
To further establish the effects of ThRIII on prostate cancer cell
migration, we did cell migration assays using fibronectin-coated
transwells seeded with either DU145-RIII cells or control DU145-
Neo cells F 150 pmol/L TGF-h1 ligand. ThRIII significantly
reduced migration through fibronectin-coated transwells, with only
42.5 F 6.5% migration of the DU145-RIII cells at 24 h relative to the
DU145-Neo cells. Addition of TGF-h1 increased the migration of
DU145-Neo cells 57.5 F 17.9% and migration of DU145-RIII cells
79.5 F 31.7%, relative to their untreated counterparts (Fig. 4C
and D). However, in the presence of 150 pmol/L TGF-h1 ligand,
there was only 55.7 F 2.7% migration of the DU145-RIII cells at
24 h relative to the DU145-Neo cells (Fig. 4C and D ; P = 0.0004,
Kruskal-Wallis test). Importantly, these differences were not due to
differences in proliferation at this time point as established by our
growth curves (Supplement Fig. S1B and C). Taken together, these
studies establish a role for ThRIII in decreasing prostate cancer
cellular motility in the presence and absence of exogenous TGF-h1
in vitro .
TBRIII decreases prostate cancer cell invasiveness. Although
alterations in motility are necessary for prostate cancer cells to
metastasize, they also need to invade through the basement
membrane. To examine the role of ThRIII in regulating prostate
cancer cell invasiveness, we used the reconstituted basement
membrane, Matrigel, to model the basement membrane (37). In a
manner similar to the fibronectin motility assays, the addition of
150 pmol/L TGF-h1 increased invasion of DU145-Neo stable cells
by 36.6 F 12% and DU145-RIII cells by 108.8 F 57.1% relative to the
same cell lines without TGF-h1 treatment. Strikingly, expression of
exogenous ThRIII in DU145 prostate cancer cells significantly
inhibited their ability to invade Matrigel by 61.6 F 14.8% in the
absence of TGF-h1 and 54.9 F 2.1% in the presence of TGF-h1
(Fig. 5; P = 0.0143, Kruskal-Wallis test). Again, these differences
were not due to differences in proliferation as established by our
growth curves (Supplement Fig. S1B and C). Taken together, these
results suggest that one potential consequence of the progressive
loss of ThRIII expression from preinvasive to invasive to metastatic
prostate cancer is the ability for these cells to become more motile
and invasive.
TBRIII decreases prostate tumor growth in vivo . To further
define ThRIII as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer, we
tested whether the restoration of ThRIII expression in DU145
prostate cancer cells decreased tumor growth in a mouse xenograft
model. Athymic mice were injected s.c. with either DU145-Neo or
DU145-RIII cells and followed. Although tumors formed in both
groups and the overall weight of the mice in both groups was
similar, tumors from DU145-Neo cells consistently grew faster and
to greater volumes as compared with tumors from DU145-RIII cells

(Fig. 6A). At the day of sacrifice, mice with tumors created from
DU145-Neo cells had a mean calculated volume 3.48 times larger
than tumors created from DU145-RIII cells (331.3 F 58.4 mm3
versus 95.5 F 22.1 mm3; P = 0.022, two-tailed independent t test).
Given that tumor volume was a calculated estimate, we also
measured tumor mass at excision. Mean tumor mass, measured at
the time of sacrifice, was significantly greater in the control DU145-
Neo group as compared with the DU145-RIII group (Fig. 6B ;
P = 0.039, two-tailed independent t test). These studies strongly
support a tumor suppressor role for ThRIII in prostate cancer
in vivo .
Discussion
Here, for the first time, we provide evidence that ThRIII is a
tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer. Through immunohis-
tochemical analysis of 350 prostate tissue cores from more than
250 patients, we show that ThRIII expression is frequently
decreased or lost in human prostate cancers, with 22.6% of HGPIN
and 45% of invasive prostate cancer specimens expressing little to
no ThRIII, whereas all of the control non-neoplastic prostate tissue
expressed medium to high levels of ThRIII. Thus, the loss of ThRIII
expression is the most frequent alteration in the TGF-h signaling
pathway in prostate cancer described to date. ThRIII expression is
also decreased at the message level in prostate cancer, with LOH at
the ThRIII genomic locus correlating with decreased ThRIII
expression. The loss of ThRIII expression correlates with increasing
clinical disease, metastatic disease, and PSA recurrence, suggesting
a role for the loss of ThRIII expression in tumor progression.
Functionally, loss of ThRIII expression results in increased cell
motility and invasiveness in vitro and increased tumorigenicity
in vivo . Taken together, these studies define ThRIII as a tumor
suppressor gene in prostate cancer, with loss of expression
correlating with prostate cancer progression.
How might the loss of ThRIII expression result in increased cell
motility and invasiveness? ThRIII functions as a coreceptor for the
TGF-h signaling pathway, enhancing ligand binding to ThRII and
increasing TGF-h signaling. In addition to this role, ThRIII through
its cytoplasmic domain interacts with the scaffolding proteins
Ga-interacting protein, C terminus (14) and h-arrestin 2 (15) which
have the potential to scaffold ThRIII to Smad-independent
signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathways (38). ThRIII is also proteolytically cleaved in the
extracellular domain to produce soluble ThRIII (sThRIII) that
can sequester TGF-h ligand and antagonize TGF-h signaling (10).
In terms of prostate cancer, sThRIII has been shown to decrease
tumor growth and angiogenesis in a xenograft model (27). Thus,
decreasing ThRIII expression could result in decreased TGF-h–
mediated Smad-dependent or Smad-independent signaling or in
decreased expression of sThRIII. The mechanism by which reduced
ThRIII expression enhances prostate cancer cell motility and
invasiveness remains an active area of investigation.
ThRIII is on the short arm of chromosome 1, 1p32, a region that
is frequently deleted in human cancers, including breast, colon,
endometrial, gastric, kidney, lung, ovarian, and testicular cancer
(34, 39). Although there are other potential tumor suppressor genes
in this region, including TP73 (40) and RUNX3 (41), previous
studies have not established these as the tumor suppressors in
these cancers. In the present study, we established LOH at the
ThRIII locus in 37% of the patients, with LOH correlating with
decreased ThRIII expression, supporting ThRIII as a tumor
suppressor gene in human prostate cancer. ThRIII has also been
reported to be lost at an early stage in renal cell carcinogenesis
(23). Whether ThRIII is the tumor suppressor gene on chromosome
1p32 in renal cell and other human cancers remains to be defined.
Although most cases of early prostate cancer can be cured with
localized approaches and locally advanced and metastatic prostate
cancer can often be controlled with hormonal therapy, many
patients ultimately become hormone refractory and succumb to
their disease, with 27,350 U.S. deaths expected in 2006. Thus, better
treatment options are required for advanced hormone refractory
prostate cancer. Given the role of the TGF-h signaling pathway in
regulating normal prostate epithelial homeostasis, including
androgen depletion–induced and androgen-independent apopto-
sis, this pathway is a promising target for treatment of advanced-
stage, hormone refractory prostate cancer. To effectively target this
pathway, increased understanding of the mechanisms through
which prostate cancer cells become resistant to the tumor
suppressor effects of TGF-h is needed. Our current data support

DU145-Neo or DU145-RIII cells were injected s.c. into both flanks of athymic
BALB/cAnNCr-nu /nu mice. The DU145-Neo group contained six mice, and
the DU145-RIII contained five mice. Mice were weighed, and tumor width (W )
and length (L ) were measured every 3 days. Tumor volume was approximated

were sacrificed at day 36 postinjection, with tumors forming in 11:12 of sites

cells. Tumors from both groups were excised and weighed. The mean tumor
mass F SEM was calculated for each mouse group. **, P = 0.039, two-tailed

that loss of ThRIII receptor expression as a common mechanism
through which prostate cancer cells escape TGF-h–mediated
tumor suppression. Given that treatment of the ThRIII-deficient
cell line DU145 with the TSA and 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine resulted in
increased ThRIII expression, our data suggest that ThRIII levels
could be restored in some cases via histone deacetylase inhibitors
and 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine analogs. In addition, because the
ectodomain of ThRIII is normally shed, some endogenous
properties of ThRIII could be restored by the administration of
exogenous sThRIII, as was recently validated in a preclinical model
of prostate cancer (27). The role of epigenetic regulation of ThRIII
expression and the role of soluble ThRIII are currently being
further defined.
ThRIII expression may also have a prognostic value in prostate
cancer. We have shown that ThRIII mRNA and protein levels
decrease with increased clinical stage and correlate with higher
PSA recurrence and metastatic disease. Whether immunohisto-
chemical staining for ThRIII on tissue specimens obtained from
radical prostatectomy could direct physicians in planning the
quality and aggressiveness of adjunctive chemotherapy or radio-
therapy requires prospective validation.
