ABSTRACT
This Account describes a new paradigm for large-area nanoscale
patterning that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches,
merging chemistry with fabrication. This hybrid strategy uses
simple nanofabrication techniques to control the alignment, size,
shape, and periodicity of nanopatterns and chemical methods to
control their materials properties and crystallinity. These tools are
highly flexible and can create surface-patterned nanostructures
with unusual properties and free-standing nanostructures that are
multifunctional and monodisperse. The unprecedented scientific
and technological opportunities enabled by nanoscale patterning
over wafer-sized areas are discussed.
Introduction
The rational engineering of surface architectures has
enabled many exciting observations, such as the enhanced
properties of molecules adsorbed on metallic particles, the
extraordinary optical transmission of light through metal-
lic films perforated with subwavelength holes, and the
incorporation of weakly interacting molecules into higher
affinity multivalent surfaces.1-4 Although the physical
origins of these phenomena are different, one striking
similarity is that the surfaces have well-defined structures
with feature sizes on the order of 100 nm or less. What is
even more intriguing is that the arrangement of the
nanofeatures on surfacessthe nanoscale patternssis re-
sponsible for much of this interesting behavior.
Research in nanoscale patterning is motivated by two
objectives: (i) tool development and (ii) scientific op-
portunities at small length scales. The first goal focuses
on designing techniques that can generate features as
small as possible. Because initial efforts in nanopatterning
were in part driven by the microelectronics industry, it
was critical that the techniques were compatible with
semiconductor processing.5 This constraint allowed the
principles of microfabrication (parallel processing over
wafer-sized areas) to be applied to nanofabrication so that
the costs would not increase prohibitively as the feature
sizes were reduced. Generating sub-100 nm structures
using optical lithography techniques, however, has been
challenging and will require short-wavelength light sources
and optics and other extensive equipment upgrades.6
Other efforts in nanopatterning rely on serial lithographic
techniques, such as electron-beam writing, focused ion
beam (FIB) milling, and scanning probe methods.7 Com-
pared to parallel nanofabrication approaches, these direct-
write methods are low throughput and are capable of
writing only small areas (hundreds of square microme-
ters).7 The second research objective focuses on how sub-
100 nm structures can enable studies of physical and
biological processes in unprecedented detail and, also,
how nanopatterns can facilitate the assembly and growth
of functional nanostructures. The ability to manipulate
individual (or small numbers of) electrons, molecules, or
nanoparticles opens groundbreaking possibilities for fun-
damental research and revolutionary technological ad-
vances.8,9
Why would chemists be interested in nanoscale pat-
terning? Or, phrased another way, are there interesting
scientific questions or advances if chemistry is combined
with fabrication? At the microscale, we need to look no
further than the impact that microarray technology has
had on DNA analysis or combinatorial organic synthesis
to answer yessboth the small spot sizes and the patterns
have enabled new ways to approach complex prob-
lems.10,11 Nanoscale patterning does not simply offer
prospects for shrinking the sizes of micrometer-sized spots
and increasing their density on surfaces but provides a
platform for discoveries, especially for interfacing mol-
ecules with metals or semiconductors. For example, an
understanding of molecule-materials interfaces is im-
portant for controlling metal-molecule contacts in mol-
ecule-based electronics and assessing semiconductor-
biomolecule compatibility in nanomedicine.8,12 Moreover,
strategies to control the assembly and organization of
molecules and nanostructures on surfaces are critical for
the direct integration of the patterns into practical devices
and architectures.
Nanopatterning tools not only enable new scientific
discoveries; they are the primary driving factorsscience
and tools are interwoven. There are, however, challenges
in nanofabrication that can stymie progress, such as (i)
expensive equipment, (ii) limited access to facilities, (iii)
time required to generate patterns, (iv) inability to pattern
large areas easily, and (v) difficulty in making functional
nanostructures. To overcome these problems, we and

others are developing a new paradigm for nanopatterning
that combines both bottom-up and top-down ap-
proaches,13-20 merging chemistry with fabrication. This
hybrid strategy uses simple fabrication techniques to
control the alignment, size, shape, and periodicity of the
nanopatterns over large areas and chemical methods to
control their local structure, crystallinity, and materials
properties.
Below we describe research from our laboratory di-
rected toward large-area nanopatterning tools that can
create surface-patterned nanostructures with unusual
optical or physical properties and free-standing nano-
structures that are monodisperse and multifunctional.
First, laser-assisted embossing using nanosphere molds
to generate nanowells for nanocrystal growth is presented.
Second, strategies to extend soft lithographic techniques
to sub-100 nm patterning are described. Third, methods
for the directed growth and assembly of nanostructures
on surfaces are discussed. Last, procedures to construct
anisotropic, multifunctional nanoparticles and free-stand-
ing films of nanoholes are outlined. We conclude by
highlighting the exciting scientific and technological
prospects that are enabled by large-area nanopatterning.
Chemistry in Zeptoliter Beakers
The intersection of nanopatterning with synthetic meth-
ods enables chemical reactions to be performed in
extremely small volumes. One bottom-up strategy for
producing nanopatterns is the assembly of sub-micro-
spheres. Polystyrene or silica spheres can be packed into
two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) hexago-
nal arrays by a variety of methods, including drop coating,
spin-casting, and convective self-assembly.17,21,22 As-
sembled sphere arrays are most often used as a “mask”
through which materials (typically metals) are deposited
within the interstitials of the spheres. After the mask is
removed, truncated prisms or interconnected honeycomb
patterns are formed with reasonably good local order.
These patterns have been used in localized surface plas-
mon resonance (LSPR) studies, as surface-enhanced Ra-
man spectroscopy (SERS) substrates, and as catalysts for
the growth of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and carbon
nanotubes.21,23-25
Besides their function as a mask, self-assembled spheres
can also be used as a nanosphere mold.17 We have used
100-nm silica spheres to generate hemispherical wells in
silicon by laser-assisted embossing (Figure 1A,B). The sizes
of the nanowells can be controlled by changing (i) the size
of the spheres in the mold, (ii) the energy density of the
incident laser pulse, and (iii) the applied mechanical
pressure between the mold and the surface. Thermal
oxidation of the patterned silicon substrates can reduce
the size of the wells by 10-20 nm. Since the nanowells
are patterned in silicon or silicon oxide, they can be
functionalized with hydrophobic or hydrophilic silane
molecules.
These nanowells are ideal reaction vessels or “beakers”
to grow isolated and monodisperse nanocrystals that are
well-ordered on a substrate. Because of their small
volumes and chemical functionality, low concentrations
of precursor materials can enable the growth of different
types and sizes of nanoparticles. We have achieved size
control of NaCl crystals down to 25 nm (Figure 1C,D) and
have grown CdS nanocrystals as small as 2 nm (Figure
1E). What is most surprising about the CdS particles is
that they are crystalline, even though these reactions were
performed at room temperature. By limiting the amount
of material available for reaction in each well, we can
control nucleation so that only one crystal is formed
within a nanowell.
This first example of nanopatterning combined with
chemical syntheses shows significant promise for the
growth and parallel assembly of individual nanocrystals.
Because isolated particles can be formed in well-defined
locations, detailed studies of the properties of individual
nanoparticles are now possible. We anticipate that these
reactors can also be used to synthesize new types of
nanomaterials at high temperatures, that is, solid state
reactions using molecular precursors. A drawback of using
the bottom-up assembly of spheres to generate nanopat-
terns is that it is somewhat inflexible, since the patterns
are limited in shape, pitch, and symmetry. In addition,
patterned areas without defects are typically on the order
of hundreds of square micrometers, although recent work
has reported patterned areas several square inches.26 One
large-area, top-down nanopatterning method can meet
many of these drawbacks: soft nanolithography.
Soft Nanopatterning Essentials
Soft lithography is a catch-all term for techniques that use
a patterned, polymeric stamp or mask to transfer patterns
(made of molecules, polymers, or metals) from one surface

to another.27 These methods, using the form of poly-
(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) most commonly used for
fabricating stamps (Sylgard 184), are best suited for
patterning features and fabricating structures on the
micrometer scale.28 To expand the capabilities of soft
lithography to the sub-100 nm regime, the mechanical
properties of the PDMS stamp must be improved.29 We
have designed composite PDMS stamps composed of a
thin, stiff layer of hard h-PDMS supported by a thick slab
of 184 PDMS.30 This h-PDMS material is a key enabler for
our suite of soft lithographic nanopatterning tools, which
can generate small (sub-30 nm) features over relatively
large areas (>1 in2).15,18-20,30,31
Our techniques have four important advantages over
serial lithographic methods: (i) Use of masters. Masters
are high-quality patterns from which many low-cost
copies can be duplicated. We can fabricate inexpensive
masters patterned with arrays of sub-250 nm features in
photoresist generated by phase-shifting photolithography
(PSP),15,30 although soft nanopatterning is readily ap-
plicable to masters prepared by other methods. (ii)
Parallelism. PDMS is cast against a master to form an
elastomeric mask, which is then used to fabricate arrays
of structures simultaneously. (iii) Simplicity. We use widely
available lithographic techniques including photolithog-
raphy, wet chemical etching, and e-beam deposition. (iv)
Flexibility. We can generate patterns with different sym-
metry and spacing, out of multiple materials, and with
exquisite control over the thickness of each layer.
Fabrication of Masters with Sub-250 nm Features.
Nanoscale patterns in photoresist (the master) can be
generated by PSP using composite PDMS masks. Feature
sizes of 100-500 nm can be produced in positive-tone
photoresist by exposing UV-light through a PDMS mask
patterned with micrometer-sized lines. If only one expo-
sure is made, lines as narrow as 50 nm are formed at the
edges of the features in the mask (Figure 2A). After two
exposures (the mask is rotated after the first exposure and
exposed again), 100-300 nm dots are formed and spaced
at the pitch of the lines. If the second exposure is through
the same mask but rotated by 90° (60°), square (hexagonal)
patterns are formed (Figure 2A). If the second exposure
is through a mask patterned with lines having a different
spacing but rotated by 90°, rectangular or quasi-1D lattices
can be generated.18 Hence, masters with 250-nm features
can be produced easily with a broad range of pitch and
symmetries. To transfer these patterns into functional
materials, we usually replicate the nanomasters in h-
PDMS to make “nanomasks,” so that the size, shape, and
symmetry of the patterns can be readily reproduced on a
variety of substrates.
Phase Shifting Photolithography at the Sub-250 nm
Level. Standard PSP is an edge lithography that produces
narrow features in photoresist at the edges of patterns in
a PDMS mask. As the patterns in a h-PDMS mask are
reduced to ca. 250 nm or less, the edges of the generated
features overlap, and thus the photoresist patterns are
identical in size and pitch to the mask (Figure 2B).15 We
took advantage of this observation to generate, in parallel,
patterns or templates in negative photoresist for deposit-
ing metal or assembling nanomaterials. The primary
limitation for creating holes and trenches using optical
lithography is the inherent resolution (sub-micrometer)
of negative-tone resists.32 We have overcome this chal-
lenge by using a negative resist that does not require the
postbaking step, which often broadens feature sizes.5 We
can also use features in positive resist to fabricate inter-
esting free-standing metallic nanostructures. Now that we
have the tools to generate nanopatterns in well-defined
locations, we need to do chemistry on them, or in other
words, make them functional.
Directed Growth and Assembly of
Semiconducting Nanostructures
Nanopatterns are well-suited to organize nanostructures
on surfaces because they are of the same length scale. This
assembly can occur by two general approaches: (i) the
directed growth of the nanostructures at predefined
locations and (ii) the synthesis of nanomaterials followed
by assembly into architectures. The properties of these
surface-patterned nanostructures can then be studied for
interesting collective effects or tested for their use in
macroscopic devices.
Directed Growth of ZnO Nanowires Arrays. ZnO
nanostructures have received much attention because of
their emission in the near-UV, strong absorption in the
UV, and field-emission capabilities.33 They can be orga-
nized on different substrates (e.g., sapphire, silicon) by
patterning the appropriate catalyst or seed layer, and
usually the ZnO nanrods are well-aligned with their c-axis
perpendicular to the substrate.34 Gold is typically the
material used to catalyze the growth of ZnO nanowires
in vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) methods, and silver has been
shown to facilitate the assembly of ZnO nanorods from
solution.35 Early work on assembling ZnO nanowires
focused on preparing Au areas patterned through masks

such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids and
monolayers of sub-microspheres.24,34 Using our simple
nanofabrication tools, we have demonstrated the flexibility
to pattern functional nanostructures at specific locations
with periodic order, variable spacing, and symmetry over
areas 1 in2.
Small diameter ZnO nanowires can be grown from
patterned, thin gold dots using a VLS process. Arrays of
nanowires have been grown in square, hexagonal, and 1D
lattices (Figure 3); ZnO nanowires exhibited different
lengths depending on the growth conditions, although
their diameters were similar in size. These nanowires have
very narrow diameters (10-15 nm) and relatively long
lengths (2-10 ím). High-resolution TEM images (Figure
3D, inset) reveal that the wires are single-crystal with
growth along the [001] direction. The photoluminescence
of ordered ZnO nanowire arrays shows strong room-
temperature emission at 374 nm with a narrow (15 nm)
full-width at half-maximum peak, which indicates the
uniformity of diameters in the arrays of ZnO nanowires
(Figure 3D).
Conversion of Metal Nanopatterns into Metal Disul-
fide Nanostructures. Besides using the patterned metallic
areas to nucleate or catalyze the growth of nanomaterials,
we have developed an important variant of the directed
growth method: chemically converting the nanopatterns
into crystalline nanostructures. We have demonstrated
this strategy for MoS2, a layered semiconducting material
that has shown promise in chemical sensors,36 in solar
cells,37 in catalysis,38 and as low-friction surfaces.39 Recent
studies have suggested that reducing the size of the MoS2
crystals can improve their lubrication properties in bear-
ings, O-rings, or other heavy wear applications.39 Although
lines of MoS2 ribbons can be grown on the step edges of
graphite by electrochemical methods,40 control of the
height, spacing, and overall length of the ribbons remains
a challenge.
Figure 4A outlines the procedure for patterning MoS2
nanostructures.19 First, sub-300 nm lines of Mo were
patterned on silicon or quartz substrates by PSP followed
by e-beam deposition of Mo and lift-off of the resist. We
then placed the Mo patterns into a quartz tube furnace
for sulfidation at 850 °C in the presence of Ar and H2S
gas. Surprisingly, the morphology of the patterned MoS2
nanostructures depends on the location of the original Mo
patterns in the furnace. Samples placed 9-10 in. down-
stream from the entrance formed MoS2 plates parallel to
the substrate (200 nm in height; Figure 4C), while
samples 3-4 in. downstream produced MoS2 plates
oriented nearly perpendicular to the substrate (50-150
nm thickness on the edge; Figure 4D). We propose that
variations in the H2S concentration along the tube furnace
or the decomposition of H2S gas along the length of the
furnace contribute to the preferential orientation of MoS2
nanocrystals.
What is most interesting about this system is that the
lateral size of the metallic nanopatterns is responsible for
the dramatic orientational growth of the MoS2 nanocrys-
tals. If the lateral size of the Mo patterns exceeds roughly
300 nm, the patterned MoS2 nanocrystals do not exhibit
any preferential growth; only a mixture of crystals oriented
parallel and perpendicular to the substrate is observed.
This unexpected result is another example of how nano-
patterning can result in new physical properties of nano-
scale materials. In addition, our nanopatterning-followed-
by-chemical conversion method can generate nano-
structures different from straight lines (Figure 4E,F). These
patterned MoS2 nanostructures are indeed functional, as
demonstrated by their crystal structure and UV-vis
absorption properties (Figure 4G).
These directed growth strategies to pattern semicon-
ducting nanostructures are quite versatile for nanomate-
rials that can either form an alloy with catalytic metallic
nanoparticles or be formed after reactions with H2S gas.
These materials have controllable orientation, height,
width, and shape and can be integrated directly into
device platforms. To organize other optical materials in
well-defined locations, without prepatterning metallic
nanostructures, we use soft templates to assemble pre-
formed nanocrystals.
Assembly of Preformed Nanocrystals Using Soft Tem-
plates. Solution-synthesized nanocrystals are ideal build-
ing blocks for a range of devices because of their unique
properties12,41 and because they can be produced in batch
quantities.42 Assembly methods to manipulate them on
surfaces include fluidic-based assembly,34,43 electric and
magnetic field mediated assembly,44-46 and electrostatic
assembly.47,48 Although these techniques can achieve good
local order of nanoparticles, the throughput is low, and
the sizes of the patterned areas are relatively small
(hundreds of square micrometers). Template-based as-
sembly is another promising approach for positioning
nanoparticles from solution into well-defined loca-
tions.17,20,49-51 Nanopatterning techniques that can gener-
ate soft templates for assembly include PSP, e-beam
lithography, and ion lithography, although only PSP can
generate patterns over large areas (square inches) in
parallel. Using PSP to define the nanopatterned templates

and colloidal semiconducting quantum dots, we have
developed a simple approach for hierarchical assembly
on all length scalessorganization over square nanometers
(self-assembly of quantum dots), over square micrometers
(template shape), and over square centimeters (arrays of
template pattern).
We performed PSP using a mask patterned with 3-ím
circles on negative resist to generate ring templates for
the assembly of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. The template
was immersed into a concentrated solution of water-
soluble quantum dots for 12-36 h and was subsequently
removed by dissolution in acetone. Patterned mesostruc-
tures of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots with curved and straight
features were achieved over areas 1 in2. Figure 5A depicts
quantum dots well-packed into rings. We tested the
integrity of the assembled quantum dots by characterizing
the localized photoluminescence from individual ring
structures using near-field scanning optical microscopy
(NSOM) (Figure 5B).
Multifunctional Metallic Nanostructures: View
from the Top
So far we have described how our nanopatterning tool-
kit can generate surface-patterned nanostructures that are
crystalline, functional, and assembled in a wide range of
patterns. In this final section, we will demonstrate how
top-down methods, using hard templates, can be used to
mold the size and shape of free-standing metallic nano-
and mesostructures. Although solution-phase synthesis is
the typical route to control the size and shape of metallic
nanoparticles, a common drawback is the formation of
various other shapes in addition to the desired product.2
Moreover, because metallic structures with sizes up to
several hundred nanometers can exhibit interesting optical
properties,52,53 large-area nanopatterning can easily achieve
these sizes and with densities comparable to those of
nanoparticles in solution.
Sacrificial templates are usually solid or supported
structures, such as nanometer-sized pores in anodized
alumina membranes or micrometer-sized etched pits in
Si.54,55 Electro-deposition of conducting materials is used
to reproduce the shape and structure of the template; the
templates can then be removed by chemical etchants.
Anisotropic structures such as metallic (and multilayered)
rods, pyramidal tips for scanning probe applications, and
metallic pyramidal shells can be produced from solid
templates.20,52,55-57 Arrays of silica spheres can also be used
to template metallic structures with unusual shapes.58,59
Top-down fabrication methods offer several advantages
over bottom-up syntheses for the generation of nanopar-
ticles: (i) monodispersity of particle size; (ii) uniformity
of particle shape; (iii) increased flexibility to form particles

out of more than one material; (iv) precise control of the
thicknesses of materials in multilayer particles.
Mesoscale Pyramids with Nanoscale Tips. We have
developed a simple procedure that can generate free-
standing, mesoscale metallic pyramids composed of one
or more materials and having nanoscale tips. These
anisotropic nanoparticles are interesting because their
optical properties can be quite different from spherical
particles of similar sizes.2 Theoretical studies have shown
that very sharp pointsstipssin noble metals can concen-
trate electromagnetic fields, which can dominate the
optical properties of nanoscale structures.60,61
Figure 6 depicts the procedure for generating metallic
pyramids within the etched pits of a Si(100) substrate
using a Cr-film patterned with sub-250 nm holes as both
the etch mask and deposition mask.20 We took advantage
of the Si undercutting the Cr mask to fabricate pyramids
smaller than the size of the etched pyramidal pits and
defined by the size of the Cr hole. The crystalline Si(111)
facets and the sharp tips of the pyramidal pits are ideal
features of a template for preparing well-formed particles.
Next, we evaporated different individual metals (Ni, Au)
or combinations of metals (Au/Ni, Au/Ni/Au) through the
Cr mask and then etched the Cr film to reveal metallic
pyramids situated within the centers of the Si pyramidal
pits. The metallic pyramids can be removed from the
template by etching the Si. The four faces of the pyramids
are remarkably smooth, and a majority (>99.9%) of the
pyramidal tips had a radius of curvature r < 10 nm with
many tips r < 2 nm.
One of the greatest advantages (besides creating nano-
scale tips) of this top-down procedure for nanoparticles
is our ability to control the materials and chemical
functionality of these pyramids. We can use the layer-by-
layer feature of e-beam deposition to create multilayered
pyramids of Au and Ni with variable thicknesses. Such
mesostructures can be manipulated with magnetic fields
because of their magnetic interior and can easily be
chemically functionalized on their outer shell. We antici-
pate that these multilayered pyramids generated out of
different types of materials (including insulators) will be
useful in investigations of certain biological systems.62 The
production of free-standing and isolated noble metal
particles with well-defined, ultrasharp tips also facilities
detailed studies of their optical properties (e.g., LSP
resonances) and their use as SERS substrates.
Large-Area Arrays of Nanoholes. In the examples
described above, we have focused on nanoparticles or
nanostructures constructed by large-area nanopatterning
methods. We want to close this Account by describing a
system having a structure that is the inverse of particles:
holes. In many aspects, the properties of nanoholes in
metallic films are analogous to the properties of nano-
particles; for example, both can support LSP resonances
that are tunable depending on their size and shape.2
Interestingly, when nanoholes are patterned into periodic
square arrays, they exhibit enhanced transmission with
peaks characteristic of interacting holes.63 These arrays are
enabling new fundamental studies of surface plasmon
interactions with periodic structures31,64-66 and novel
technologies including spectroscopically based chemical
and biological sensors and photonic devices.67-70 The most
common method to fabricate hole arrays is FIB milling,63
a serial and low throughput approach that can control the
diameter and spacing of the holes with reasonable preci-
sion. We have developed a simple approach for generating
free-standing, large-area films of nanoholes that will
enable increased access to these films, which is critical
not only for more detailed investigations but for their use
in scalable device applications.
Large-area films of nanohole arrays were prepared in
a procedure similar to that for creating metallic pyramids
(Figure 7). After the Cr film is etched to expose the
pyramids in the Si pits, a metallic film of nanohole arrays
can be detached from the Si substrate and placed on a
glass slide or any other substrate. Because the materials
of these films are deposited by e-beam evaporation, these
FIGURE 6. (A) Scheme depicting the fabrication of the free-standing

hole arrays can be made of almost any material. We have
constructed hole array films with a single materials layer,
two layers, and three layers. Our materials general tech-
nique can even generate nanohole films from a combina-
tion of metal and dielectric materials (Figure 7E). Unlike
hole arrays fabricated by FIB, the overall topography of
these large-area films is flat and very uniform.
We tested the optical quality of the hole arrays using
NSOM in transmission mode. Under local illumination
(excitation wavelength, ìex ) 633 nm) from the tip, a 100-
nm thick Au film exhibited enhanced transmission at the
holes as well as fringes reminiscent of standing wave
patterns between adjacent holes (Figure 8A). These fringes
can be attributed to the interference between surface
plasmon polariton (SPP) waves generated by the NSOM
tip and the SPPs reflected by the holes.31 We calculated
that standing waves in the near-field intensity appeared
on both the top and bottom metal surfaces and that these
fringes in the near-field should lead to intensity maxima
in the far-field with a period (ìsw) approximately half of
the SPP wavelength (ìSPP ) 603 nm66) at the Au film/air
interface (Figure 8B). Indeed, fringes with ìsw  322 nm,
ca. ìSPP/2, were measured in the experiment (Figure 8C).
Multilayered films (Au/Ni/Au) consisting of a Ni core
sandwiched between two layers of Au with thicknesses of
40 nm/20 nm/40 nm (40/20/40) and 40/70/40 were also
investigated. Under ìex ) 633 nm light, both films exhib-
ited standing wave patterns with a period of ìsw  320
nm, nearly identical to the pure Au film case. We also
imaged the 40/70/40 film with ìex ) 800 nm (ìSPP  784
nm66) and observed fringes with an increased spacing, ìsw
 380 nm, which is ca. ìSPP/2 at this excitation wavelength
and consistent with our model. This technology provides
a flexible strategy to create large-area films of high optical
quality out of both metallic and dielectric materials and
whose properties can be rapidly screened and tailored for
sensing and photonics. Importantly, these tools enable
new ways to think about combining SPPs for signal
propagation with LSPs for coupling to and from the far-
field and to imagine versatile metal and dielectric com-
posites for negative index applications at optical frequen-
cies.
Concluding Remarks
In this Account, we have introduced the concept of large-
area nanoscale patterningsthe new nanofabrication tools
that emerge when chemistry meets fabrication. More than
simply a necessary intermediate for practical devices or a
“bridge” across the microscale-nanoscale divide, these
tools allow hierarchical assembly, the patterning of ma-
terials on multiple length scales and with multiple func-
tions, unusual shapes, and crystalline structure. Applying
materials chemistry to nanopatterning not only produces
a unique tool-kit that is general for many different
materials but creates opportunities to observe unexpected
behavior, such as the orientated growth of MoS2 nano-
structures or the room-temperature growth of CdS nano-
crystals in nanobeakers. Another compelling outcome of
patterning functional nanostructures is that a demand for
more versatile characterization techniques is createdshow

can the instrumentation for the in-situ analysis of surface-
patterned nanostructures be developed or made more
accessible? Most researchers must remove the structures
(i.e., destroy the patterns) from the surface to carry out a
detailed structural analysis.
To close, we want to emphasize the importance of
patterning over large areas. The ability to pattern, in
parallel, over several square inches allows nanofeatures
to be used for rapid screening, high-throughput applica-
tions, and prototyping. Also, our development of large-
area patterning tools using only simple materials (PDMS)
and widely available lithographic techniques (e-beam
deposition, photolithography, and etching) allows in-
creased access to nanopatterned structures at a substan-
tially reduced cost, both in time and in equipment
resources. We believe, moreover, that these tools will
enable exciting scientific opportunities and allow unprec-
edented flexibility for applications that were previously
only a speck on the horizon.
