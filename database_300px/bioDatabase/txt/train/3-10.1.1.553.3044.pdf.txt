ABSTRACT
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is
a primate lentivirus that causes the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition to
the virion structural proteins and enzyme precur-
sors, that are Gag, Env and Pol, HIV-1 encodes
several regulatory proteins, notably a small nuclear
transcriptional activator named Tat. The Tat protein
is absolutely required for virus replication since it
controls proviral DNA transcription to generate the
full-length viral mRNA. Tat can also regulate mRNA
capping and splicing and was recently found to
interfere with the cellular mi- and siRNA machinery.
Because of its extensive interplay with nucleic
acids, and its basic and disordered nature we
speculated that Tat had nucleic acid-chaperoning
properties. This prompted us to examine in vitro the
nucleic acid-chaperoning activities of Tat and Tat
peptides made by chemical synthesis. Here we
report that Tat has potent nucleic acid-chaperoning
activities according to the standard DNA annealing,
DNA and RNA strand exchange, RNA ribozyme
cleavage and trans-splicing assays. The active
Tat(44–61) peptide identified here corresponds to
the smallest known sequence with DNA/RNA cha-
peroning properties.
INTRODUCTION
The human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1, HIV-1, is a
member of the lentivirus family that is widespread in
primates, and is the causative agent of the acquired
immunodeﬁciency syndrome known as AIDS (1). HIV-1
codes for the three canonical retroviral polyprotein
precursors, which are needed for virus formation and
infectivity, namely Gag, Pol and Env (2). As a complex
retrovirus, HIV-1 also encodes six regulatory proteins,
namely Tat, Rev, Vpr, Vpu, Vif and Nef, that carry out
important roles in virus replication, either acting at the
level of viral RNA synthesis and its nuclear export in
the case of Tat and Rev, or suppressing virus restriction by
the host factor APOBEC 3G in the case of Vif (3,4). At the
end of the early steps of HIV-1 replication, the newly
made proviral DNA is integrated into the host genome via
the concerted action of the viral integrase enzyme, the
nucleocapsid (NC) protein, and the cellular cofactor
LEDGF (5–7). In infected cells, transcription of the
integrated proviral DNA requires the viral Tat protein for
the synthesis of the full-length viral mRNA. As extensively
documented, Tat is a small nuclear transcriptional
activator which controls productive proviral DNA tran-
scription from the 50 long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1,
via its interaction with the transactivation response (TAR)
RNA element (2,8,9). As for any transcriptional activator,
Tat could facilitate either of two reactions taking place at
the beginning of DNA transcription, namely recruitment
of an RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) complex to the
promoter, and the escape of that initial complex from the
promoter into productive RNA synthesis (8,10,11). In
fact, the most likely scenario by which Tat activates by
several 100-fold transcription from the HIV-1 50 LTR, is
that Tat promotes an eﬃcient transcription elongation.
The conversion of non-processive RNAP II complexes
into productive ones by Tat has been the matter of a large
number of studies, which led to the identiﬁcation of many
Tat-associated host transcription factors and regulatory
proteins (12–15). A highly simpliﬁed view proposes that
Tat contacts the nascent viral TAR RNA and recruits
various transcription factors such as the TATA-binding

protein (TBP), the general transcription factor TFIIB and
the positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFB),
itself composed of cyclin T1 and the cyclin-dependent
kinase 9 (CDK9). This leads to the formation of very
active elongating transcription complexes (16,17). The
hyperphosphorylation of RNAP II by CDK9 will also
ensure the rapid cyclic reuse of elongation complexes to
achieve a continuous and rapid reinitiation of transcrip-
tion to the beneﬁt of the viral promoter strength (18,19).
This scenario favors the notion that Tat acts by interacting
with multiple viral and cellular partners at a time. In
accordance with the view that Tat is multi-functional it
has been shown that Tat also regulates mRNA capping
(20) and splicing (21), and interferes with the cellular RNA
interference (RNAi) machinery through interactions with
DICER and RNA (22,23).
Tat is a small basic protein conserved in all primate
lentiviruses (24), and is poorly structured as a free protein
in solution (25). The basic and intrinsically disordered
nature of the HIV-1 Tat protein may well account for its
ability to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids in
a manner similar to RNA chaperones such as the HIV-1
NC protein, Flaviviridae core proteins, or the cellular
fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP (26–28).
These unique features of Tat made us speculate that it
had general nucleic acid-chaperoning activities resembling
those of HIV-1 NCp7, as suggested by recent publications
(29,30). To examine this possibility, Tat and Tat peptides
were synthesized and their nucleic acid-chaperoning
activities were extensively studied in vitro. Here we show
that Tat has potent nucleic acid-chaperoning activities, as
evidenced by a number of standard RNA chaperoning
assays (RCA) (31,32). We also ﬁnd that the basic Tat(44–
61) peptide encompassing the Tat basic domain is the
smallest reported peptide with nucleic acid-chaperone
activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA substrates
The HIV-1 LTR DNA corresponding to the NY5 strain
was generated by PCR, 50 end 32P- labelled and puriﬁed by
electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel followed by QIAEX
II extraction (Qiagen).
Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) used for DNA binding,
annealing and strand transfer assays corresponded to the
HIV-1 TAR and the repeated R sequences, in the sense
and anti-sense orientations, respectively. ODNs used for
the HIV-1 RNA displacement assays (U3-R), in the
sense or anti-sense orientation, corresponded to part of
the LTR. ODNs were purchased from Eurogentec
(Belgium) and IBA GmbH Nucleic Acids Product
Supply (Go¨ttingen, Germany). TAR, R and U3-R
ODNs are 56, 96 and 74 nt in length, respectively.
ODNS U3-R(+) and (–) were used to mimic the start
of transcription and release of the nascent RNA.
TAR(), R(+) andU3-R() ODNs were 32P-labelled
with 50 mCi of [a-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase.
32P-labelled ODNs were puriﬁed by 10% PAGE, 7M urea
in 50mM Tris–borate, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.3 (0.5 TBE).
They were recovered, ethanol precipitated and dissolved in
sterile H2O before use.
Fluorescently labelled TAR() derivatives were labelled
at their 30 termini with 5(and6)-carboxyﬂuorescein (Fl)
using a special solid support with the dye already
attached. In doubly labelled TAR() derivatives, the
50 end was additionally labelled with carboxytetramethyl-
rhodamine (TMR) via an amino-linker with a six carbon
spacer arm. Labelled oligonucleotides were puriﬁed by
reverse-phase HPLC and polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis.
In vitro generated RNAs
RNAs used for the ribozyme assay were synthesized by
in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase as
previously published (31). For the trans-splicing assay (33),

template DNAs were generated by digesting H1 DNA
(exon 1+50intron) and H2 DNA (30intron+exon 2) with
SalI (H1) or BamHI (H2), respectively. Construct H1
consists of 549 nt of exon 1 and 131 nt of the 50 part of the
intron of the T4 phage thymidylate synthase (td) gene pre-
mRNA. Construct H2 consists of 147 nt of the 30 half of
the intron and 23 nt of exon 2 of td pre-mRNA. RNAs H1
and H2 were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7
RNA polymerase as above during which they were
labelled by incorporation of [35S]-UMP.
For the viral RNA displacement assay, plasmid
pHIVCG4 was cut with NheI and used for in vitro
synthesis of HIV-1 RNA (position 1–46).
All RNAs were puriﬁed by 5% PAGE containing 7M
urea and 50mM Tris–borate pH 8.3, 1mM EDTA (0.5
TBE). RNAs were recovered by elution in 0.3M sodium
acetate, 0.1% SDS, for 4 h at 378C and ethanol
precipitated. RNAs recovered by centrifugation were
dissolved in sterile H2O and quantiﬁed by UV at
254 nm. RNA integrity was veriﬁed by PAGE in 7M urea.
Tat and NC proteins
Biologically active full-length Tat protein and Tat peptides
were chemically synthesized using optimized Fmoc
chemistry protocols, and were puriﬁed by reverse-phase
HPLC (34). Their purity was monitored by analytical
RP-HPLC on a Beckman instrument (Gagny, France)
with a Nucleosil C18 5-mm column (150 4.6mm) and a
Nucleosil C4 5-mm column (150 4.6mm), respectively,
using a linear gradient of 0.1% TFA in water and
acetonitrile containing 0.08% TFA at a ﬂow rate of
1.2ml/min. Finally, integrity of each peptide was assessed
by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-
ﬂight spectrometry on a Protein TOFTM mass spectro-
meter (Bruker, Wissembourg, France). The mass of Tat
protein was assessed by LC/MS using a Thermoﬁnigan
LCQ. NCp7 and mutant NCp7(12–53) were chemically
synthesized and puriﬁed by RP-HPLC as previously
published (29,35). Peptides were dissolved at 1 mg/ml in
a freshly prepared oxygen-free buﬀer containing 30mM
HEPES pH 6.5, 30mM NaCl and 0.1mM ZnCl2.
Extinction coeﬃcients of 1300, 5690 and 8250M1 cm1
were used to determine the concentrations of Tat(21–43),
Tat(44–61), Tat(1–20) and Tat(1–86) peptides at 280 nm.
Since no aromatic residue was present in Tat(48–86), its
concentration was determined at 214 nm, using an
extinction coeﬃcient of 57 600M1 cm1, calculated
using Equation (2) of Kuipers and Gruppen (36).
UV-visible absorption and steady-state fluorescence
measurements
Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 400 spectro-
photometer. Fluorescence emission spectra and kinetic
traces were recorded on a FluoroMax spectroﬂuorometer
(Jobin Yvon) equipped with a thermostated cell compart-
ment. Binding experiments were performed by adding
increasing peptide concentrations to 10 nM TAR()-30-Fl
and monitoring the steady-state ﬂuorescence anisotropy
using a T-format SLM 8000 spectroﬂuorometer at 208C.
The emitted light of TAR()-30-Fl was monitored through
high-pass ﬁlters (520 nm) (Kodak). A home-built device
ensured the automatic rotation of the excitation polarizer.
The apparent binding constant Kapp was recovered by
ﬁtting the ﬂuorescence anisotropy data using:

performed in 25mM Tris (pH 7.5), 30mM NaCl, 0.2mM
MgCl2, with the exception of the binding experiments with
Tat(21–43) where 50mM HEPES (pH 6.5), 30mM NaCl,
0.2mM MgCl2 was used to limit the aggregation of the

Real-time TAR(+)/TAR() anneling kinetics were
monitored in pseudo ﬁrst-order conditions by using
300 nM TAR(+) and 10 nM of the doubly labelled
TMR-50-TAR()-30-Fl sequence. Tat peptides were
added to the TAR sequences at a molar ratio of 1–3
peptides per oligonucleotide. The annealing reaction
was triggered by mixing the TAR(+)/peptide and
TMR-50-TAR()-30-Fl/peptide solutions. Excitation and
emission wavelengths were 480 nm and 520 nm,
respectively, to monitor the Fl ﬂuorescence. At a

Electrophoresis-based nucleic acid binding and chaperoning
assays
The DNA-binding assay. The 32P-labelled TAR() DNA
(0.03 pmol) was incubated with an increasing concentra-
tion of Tat or Tat peptide for 5min at 378C in buﬀer A
(20mM Tris–HCl pH 7.0, 30mM NaCl, 0.1mM MgCl2,
5mM DTT and 10 mM ZnCl2). Next, we added 5 ml of a
solution containing 20% glycerol, 20mM EDTA pH 8.0
and 0.25% bromophenol blue. Nucleoprotein complexes
were analysed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in
stringent conditions (0.5 TB pH 8.3, 1mM EDTA at
208C). The agarose gel was dried and then submitted to
autoradiography.
The TAR()/TAR(+) DNA annealing assay. TAR(+)
and 32P-TAR() ODNs were incubated (0.03 pmol each)
in 10 ml of buﬀer A at increasing protein concentrations as
indicated in the ﬁgure legends. Reactions were performed
at 378C for 5min except for the positive control that
was incubated at 658C. To stop the reaction and
denature the protein in order to release it from the
32P-ODN, we added 5 ml of a solution containing 20%
glycerol, 20mM EDTA pH 8.0, 2% SDS, 0.25%
bromophenol blue and 0.4mg/ml calf liver tRNA.
Samples were resolved by 8% native PAGE in 50mM
Tris–borate pH 8.3, 1mM EDTA at 48C. Subsequently,
gels were autoradiographed and the amounts of labelled
single-stranded and double-stranded DNA were assessed
by phosphorimaging.
The DNA strand exchange assay. 32P-labelled R(+) wt,
R().30-modiﬁed and R() wt were separately heat
denatured for 2min at 958C and chilled on ice. All
components were kept at 48C. 0.03 pmol each of
32P-labelled R(+) wt and R().30-modiﬁed, at a concen-
tration of 6 108M, were mixed with the reaction buﬀer
to a ﬁnal concentration of 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.0,
30mM NaCl, 0.1mM MgCl2, 10 mM ZnCl2 and 5mM
DTT in 5 ml ﬁnal volume, incubated for 30min at 628C
under oil and chilled on ice. Then, 0.03 pmol of R() wt
was added together with the protein using a protein to
nucleotide molar ratio as indicated in the ﬁgure legends.
Assays were conducted for 5min at 378C, then chilled
on ice and stopped with 2.5ml of 20% glycerol, 20mM
EDTA pH 8.0, 0.2% SDS, 0.25% bromophenol blue
and 0.4mg/ml calf liver tRNA. Samples were resolved
by 6% native PAGE in 0.5 TBE at 48C and gels were
subsequently autoradiographed. Levels of DNA strand
exchange were assessed by phosphorimaging.
The hammerhead ribozyme cleavage assay. Ribozyme and
substrate RNA were independently heated for 1min at
908C in sterile H2O. The reaction buﬀer was added to yield
ﬁnal concentrations of 5mM MgCl2, 100mM NaCl,
20mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5. After slow cooling to 378C,
RNAs were incubated for 5min at 208C. Ribozyme
measuring 0.02 pmol and 0.08 pmol of RNA substrate
were then combined in a ﬁnal volume of 10 ml. Each
protein was added at ﬁnal protein to nucleotide molar
ratios as indicated in the legend of the ﬁgures. Incubations
were for 20–30min at 378C. Reactions were stopped by
adding 20 ml of the stop solution (0.3% SDS, 15mM
EDTA), and extracted with 30 ml of phenol and 15 ml of
chloroform. The aqueous phase was precipitated with
ethanol and the pellet re-suspended in 45% formamide,
0.5 TBE and 0.1% dyes. 32P-labelled RNAs were
analysed on 8% PAGE in 7M urea and 0.5 TBE.
After electrophoresis, gels were autoradiographed
and levels of RNA cleavage were assessed by
phosphorimaging.
The RNA trans-splicing assay. In vitro generated RNAs
(0.2 pmol of each 35S-labelled RNA) (2 108M) were
incubated for 1min at 958C in sterile H2O. After slow
cooling down to 378C, the splicing buﬀer (40mM Tris–
HCl at pH 7.4, 3mM MgCl2, 0.4mM spermidine, 4mM
DTT), 8 U RNasin and 0.33 pmol 32P-GTP were added.
Protein was added to ﬁnal protein to RNA molar ratios as
indicated in the ﬁgure legends (typically at concentrations
of 2 108 to 107M). Incubation was for 30min at 378C
in 10 ml ﬁnal volume. Reactions were stopped by adding
a stop solution (40mM EDTA, 5 mg of tRNA). Proteins
were removed by phenol–chloroform extractions, and
samples processed as above. Precipitated RNAs were
re-suspended in 85% formamide, 0.5 TBE and 0.1%
dyes (xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue), heat dena-
tured and loaded on a denaturing 5% PAGE in 7M
urea and 0.5 TBE. 50 32P-labelled FX174 DNA HinfI
markers (Promega) were used for size determination (not
shown). After electrophoresis, gels were autoradio-
graphed and levels of trans-splicing were assessed by
phosphorimaging.
The DNA/RNA exchange assay. The ODN U3-R()
and viral 32P-RNA (nt 1–46) (0.1 pmol each) were heat
denatured for 2min at 908C and annealed at 608C for
30min in buﬀer A, in 10 ml ﬁnal volume. Then, ODN
U3-R(+) (0.1 pmol) was added together with Tat or Tat
peptide, followed by incubation for 5min at 308C.
Reactions were stopped and proteins removed as indicated
above. ODNs and RNA were separated on a 400 Spreadex
gel under native conditions (Euromedex). Quantitations
were by phosphorimaging as above.

RESULTS
Binding of Tat and Tat peptides to TARDNA
The HIV-1 transactivator Tat is a basic protein of about
11.5 kDa, which tightly binds a short nascent stem–loop
RNA structure, TAR (transactivation response element),
for its activity (37,38). Tat is encoded by two exons,
namely exon 1 for residues 1 to 72 and exon 2 for residues
73–86 in the case of laboratory strains and 73–101 found
in most clinical isolates (39). Tat contains ﬁve domains
that are the N-terminal domain I (aa 1–20), the cysteine-
rich domain II (aa 21–40), the hydrophobic core domain
III (aa 41–48), the RNA-binding domain IV encompass-
ing the basic RKKRRQRRR motif and a glutamine-rich
region (aa 49–72) necessary for the transactivation, and
the C-terminal domain V of variable size (73–86 or
73–101) (Figure 1). Tat contains a large number of
conserved arginine and lysine residues, notably between
positions 45 and 60 in the core and RNA-binding
domains. In good agreement with recently published
NMR data (25), a computer prediction of Tat folding
indicated that Tat alone is mostly unstructured
(Supplementary Figure 1), and thus could be classiﬁed
as an intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP), a hallmark
of cellular and viral RNA chaperones (28,40). In order to
examine the nucleic acid binding and potential chaperon-
ing properties of Tat, full-length Tat (1–86) and Tat
peptides corresponding to the N-terminal domain I
(aa 1–20), to the cysteine-rich domain (aa 21–43), to
part of the core and RNA-binding domains III/IV
(aa 44–61) and to the glutamine-rich region together
with the C-terminus (aa 48–86) were synthesized and
puriﬁed to homogeneity in conditions preventing oxida-
tion in vitro (see Materials and methods section).
Tat and the peptides were examined for their ability to
bind nucleic acids in vitro, using TAR DNA at a
concentration of 3 109M and stringent conditions
(see Materials and methods section). As shown in
Figure 2A, Tat protein and the basic peptides 44–61 and
48–86, but not peptide 1–20, were found to tightly bind
TAR DNA at concentrations of 2–4 108M, leading to
the formation of stable nucleoprotein complexes. Similar
data were obtained with the HIV-1 50 leader RNA
containing the 50 TAR sequence (data not shown). The
cysteine-rich peptide 21–43 was found to aggregate,
precluding a clear examination of its DNA-binding
property by gel retardation assay (data not shown). The
binding of the Tat peptides to TAR() was further
investigated by ﬂuorescence anisotropy using TAR()
labelled with 5(and6)-carboxyﬂuorescein (Fl). The binding
stoichiometry was inferred from the intersection of the
initial slope of the titration with the ﬂuorescence
anisotropy plateau in the absence of salt to maximize
the aﬃnity of the peptides for cTAR (Figure 2B inset).
Initial experiments with various concentrations of
TAR()-30-Fl showed that below 20 nM, TAR aggrega-
tion caused by the Tat peptides was avoided.
For Tat(1–86), the number of binding sites was found to
be about seven (Table 1), corresponding to an occluded
binding site of about 8nt per protein. The large
increase in the ﬂuorescence anisotropy (from 0.06 to 0.22)
could be readily explained by the 5-fold mass increase of
TAR when it was bound to seven Tat protein molecules.
A slightly larger number of binding sites (10) was
observed for both Tat(48–86) and Tat(44–61) peptides.
Since the molar mass of Tat(48–86) is about twice that of
acidic cysteine-rich core RNA-binding Domain V

DNA migrates as a double band due to its extensive secondary
structure. (B) Binding curves of Tat derivatives to TAR() monitored
by steady-state ﬂuorescence anisotropy. The concentration of TAR()-
30-Fl was 10 nM. Anisotropy titrations were performed by adding
increasing concentrations of Tat(1–86) (triangles), Tat(48–86) (circles),
Tat(44–61) (squares) in 25mM Tris (pH 7.5), 30mM NaCl, 0.2mM
MgCl2. Excitation wavelength was 480 nm. Solid lines correspond to
the ﬁt of the experimental points with Equation (1) and the parameters
of Table 1. Inset: determination of the binding stoichiometry in the
absence of NaCl. The intercept of the initial slope with the plateau
gives the number of Tat(1–86) binding sites on TAR().

Tat(44–61), this explains the higher anisotropy plateau
observed with the former peptide. No DNA binding was
observed for Tat(1–20). The apparent binding constant,
Kapp, was determined for the peptides (Figure 2B), by
assuming that the binding sites on TAR DNA are
identical and independent. This approach was shown to
be reasonable to assess the aﬃnities of other viral proteins
and their mutants to TAR DNA (41,42). By ﬁtting the
binding curves with Equation (1), a Kapp value of
2.3 0.8 108M1 was obtained for Tat(1–86). Similar
values were obtained with both Tat(48–86) and
Tat(44–61) peptides. Due to its aggregating properties,
only a rough estimation of the Kapp value of Tat(21–43)
could be obtained, indicating an about two orders of
magnitude decrease with respect to Tat(48–86) and
Tat(44–61). Thus, the binding of Tat to TAR DNA is
mainly mediated by its nucleic acid-binding (48–61)
domain.
The basic and intrinsically unstructured nature of Tat,
together with its ability to strongly bind nucleic acids
suggested to us that Tat could have nucleic acid-
chaperoning properties, similar to the NC protein of
HIV-1, that is a key viral factor involved in proviral DNA
synthesis (5,6,29,43). To investigate how Tat may assist
nucleic acid folding, we used standard nucleic acid
chaperone assays, namely DNA annealing and strand
exchange (44), ribozyme-directed cleavage of an RNA
substrate (45) and RNA trans-splicing (32,33,46).
Tat stimulates DNA annealing and strand exchange
The DNA annealing assays used the TAR(+) and
TAR() sequences of 56 nt in length, which fold into
stable stem–loop structures. Hybridization of TAR(+) to
TAR() to form a double-stranded DNA was examined
by PAGE in native conditions (Figure 3A). Formation of
TAR(+):TAR() occurred upon heating at 658C
(Figure 3B, lane 2) or upon addition of the HIV-1 NC
protein (data not shown; see also ref. 29). Tat(1–86)
promoted hybridization of TAR(+) to TAR()
(Figure 3B, lanes 4–7) at protein concentrations of 2–
4 108M while DNA concentration was 0.6 108M
(see Materials and methods section). These results are
similar to those found for NCp7 (see Figure 3 legend and

(B) TAR(+) and 32P-labelled TAR() DNA at 6 109M were
incubated together in the presence of increasing concentrations of Tat
or a Tat derived peptide (see Materials and methods section). Upon
annealing at 658C for 30min a double-stranded TAR DNA was formed
(lane 2) but not at 378C (lane 3). Lanes 4–7: Tat at increasing
concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 108M (corresponding to protein to
nt molar ratios of respectively 1:68, 1:34, 1:17 and 1:8.5), for 5min at
378C; lanes 8 and 9: no dsTAR DNA formation occurred with
Tat(1–20) even at 1–2 107M; lanes 10–13: annealing occured with
Tat peptide (44–61) at peptide to nt molar ratios of 1:120, 1:60, 1:30
and 1:15. Ds TAR DNA formation also occurred with Tat(48–86) but
only at a concentration of 4 108M (corresponding to a peptide to nt
molar ratio of 1:8.5) (lane 17). TAR DNA migrates as a double band
due to its extensive secondary structure. (C) Annealing of TAR() to
TAR(+) promoted by Tat. The kinetic traces were recorded with
10 nM TMR-50-TAR()-30-Fl and 300 nM TAR(+) with Tat(44–61)
(dots) and Tat(1–20) (solid line) at a molar ratio of three peptides per
ODN. Kinetic traces are also shown at one peptide per ODN for the
complete Tat(1–86) (dash dot) and Tat(44–61) (dash). The kinetic trace
with Tat(21–43) was performed at a ratio of 13 peptides per ODN
(dash dot dot). The kinetic trace with Tat(48–86) at a ratio of three
peptides per ODN is fully superimposable with that of Tat(44–61) at
the same ratio and is thus not represented. Excitation and emission
wavelength were 480 nm and 520 nm, respectively. The lines correspond
to the ﬁt of the kinetic traces with Equation (2) and the parameters of
Table 2.

ref. 29). Tat peptides (44–61) and (48–86) but not peptide
1–20 promoted Tar DNA annealing at concentrations of
2–4 108M (lanes 10–13 and 14–17). It is interesting to
note that Tat(44–61) was about two times more active
than the Tat peptide (48–86) (compare lanes 12 and 16 and
see ﬁgure 3 legend). The annealing activity of peptide
(21–43) was found to be about 10 times less than that of
peptide (44–61) (70% annealing at peptide to nt molar
ratios of 1:60 and 1:4 for 44–61 and 21–43, respectively)
(lane 12 and data not shown).
To quantify the Tat-promoted TAR(+)/TAR()
annealing, we monitored their real-time annealing kinetics
in pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions by mixing 10 nM TMR-
50-TAR()-30-Fl with a 30-fold excess of non-labelled
TAR(+). Formation of the TAR(+)/TAR() extended
duplex (ED) strongly increases the interchromophore
distance, leading to a full recovery of Fl emission (47).
In the absence of Tat, TAR(+)/TAR() DNA annealing
was previously shown to involve two distinct kinetic
components characterized by two slow second-order rate
constants (48). Due to the high concentration of TAR(+)
needed for the pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions, distorted
kinetic traces owing to aggregation were observed when
Tat(1–86) was added at a molar ratio of protein to TAR 
2 or when Tat(48–86) or Tat(44–61) was added at a ratio
of protein to TAR  5. As a consequence, the annealing
reactions were monitored at lower ratios where no
aggregation occured. In the presence of Tat(48–86) or
Tat(44–61) at a molar ratio of three peptide molecules per
TAR, the same ﬂuorescence plateau was reached as with
the Tat protein, indicating that the reaction went to
completion generating the ED (Figure 3C). Tat and the
two peptides dramatically increased the annealing kinetics,
since the reaction was complete in <10min, instead of
more than one day in the absence of Tat peptide. The
observed kinetic rate constants (kobs1 and kobs2 values)
with the two peptides were respectively one and two orders
of magnitude larger than the corresponding values in the
absence of peptide (Table 2). The similar annealing
activities of the two peptides suggested that these activities
are mainly supported by the nucleic acid-binding
(aa 48–61) domain. In agreement with this, monitoring
of the Tat(21–43) annealing activity by ﬂuorescence
intensity showed that it was about 10 times less active
than Tat(44–61) (Table 2). Comparison of Tat(44–61)
with Tat(1–86) at a molar ratio of one peptide per TAR
further revealed that the full-length Tat was substantially
more active than the peptide (Table 2). This indicates that
residues ﬂanking the basic (48–61) domain contribute to
the Tat-promoted TAR(+)/TAR() annealing and that a
substantial promotion of TAR(+)/TAR() annealing can
be achieved at a molar ratio as low as one Tat per TAR
sequence. In sharp contrast, no promotion of TAR(+)/
TAR() DNA annealing was observed with Tat(1–20)
(Figure 3C and Table 2).
The next assays aimed at investigating the ability of Tat
to promote formation of the most stable double stranded
nucleic acid. These assays used three DNA molecules of
96 nt in length representing the R sequence of the HIV-1
LTR (Figure 4A). First, R(+) was annealed to a
mutant R() containing seven mutations at its 30 end

R(+)DNA (lane 1) was annealed to an equal amount of mutant R()
DNA with three mismatched regions at its 30 end (see Materials and

double-stranded R(+):R(–) DNA is shown in lane 2. R(–) DNA and
Tat were added to the R(+):R(–) mutant and reactions were conducted
for 5min at 378C. After Tat removal, the ﬁnal DNA products were
analysed by PAGE in native conditions (see Materials and methods
section) Lanes 5–7: Tat concentrations were 0.5, 1 and 2 107M,
corresponding to protein to nt molar ratios of respectively 1:18, 1:9 and
1:4.5. Lanes 8–10: Tat(1–20) at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5 and
1 106M. Lanes 11–15: Tat(44–61) at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1,
2 and 4 107M, corresponding to protein to nt molar ratios of
respectively 1:36, 1:18, 1:9, 1:4.5 and 1:2.2. Lanes 16–20: Tat(48–86) at

Note that Tat(44–61) was as active as Tat(1–86) and more active than
Tat(48–86) (compare lanes 6,12 and 17).

(Materials and methods section) by heating at 628C for
30min (Figure 4B, lane 3 to be compared with lane 2
corresponding to the R(+):R() DNA). Next, R()
DNA and Tat were added to the imperfect double-
stranded DNA and incubated for 5min at 378C
(Figure 4A). The ﬁnal DNA products were analysed by
PAGE in native conditions. As previously reported, HIV-
1 NCp7 directed DNA strand exchange by replacing the
mutated R() by the wild type R() in the double
stranded DNA (data not shown and refs 5,6,43). The basic
peptide NC(12–53) was able to bind DNA but unable to
promote the DNA strand exchange under these in vitro
conditions (data not shown). Tat was eﬃcient at directing
the DNA strand exchange (Figure 4B, lanes 5–7) at
concentrations of 1–2 107M. Tat peptides (44–61)
(lanes 11–15) and (48–86) (lanes 16–20) also promoted
strand exchange at concentrations of 1–2 107M.
Again, Tat(44–61) was clearly more active than
Tat(48–86) (compare lanes 12 and 17) while Tat(1–20)
was inactive even at 106M (lanes 8–10).
Tat enhances hammerhead ribozyme cleavage of an RNA
substrate
Ribozyme-directed cleavage of an RNA substrate allows
examination of both the RNA annealing and unwinding
activities of nucleic acid chaperones (31). Chaperones are
thought to enhance the rate of ribozyme cleavage by
activating the annealing of the substrate RNA to the
ribozyme (Figure 5A, step 1) and the unwinding and
release of the RNA products (Figure 5A, step 3), thus
allowing fast recycling of the ribozyme. The ribozyme
cleavage assay examines whether Tat can accelerate
ribozyme cleavage of an RNA substrate in a manner
similar to the viral NCp7 chaperone (see Figure 5A)
(31,49). We selected the R3 hammerhead ribozyme and
two RNA substrates, namely S14 with a 14-nt substrate-
ribozyme duplex length (7 nt on either side of the cleavage
site) and S20 with 10 nt on either side of the cleavage site.
The above RNA substrate model system was chosen due
to its likely biological relevance as evidenced by the
similarity of data obtained in vitro and in cultured cells
(49). Labelled RNA S14 (Figure 5B, lane 1), the ribozyme
R3 (lane 2) and Tat or a Tat peptide were mixed and
incubated. Next, RNAs were deproteinized, recovered and
analysed by PAGE under denaturing conditions. In the
absence of a chaperone, ribozyme-directed cleavage of the
RNA substrate occurred only slowly at 378C (Figure 5B,
lanes 3 at 48C and 4 at 378C; labelled RNA substrate is S14
and cleaved product S14). In agreement with previous
reports (49), HIV-1 NCp7 caused ribozyme cleavage of
RNA S14 to reach completion at a concentration as low as
2 108M (lanes 5–7). On the other hand, mutant
NC(12–53) was inactive even at a concentration of
2 107M (lane 8). Interestingly, Tat strongly enhanced
ribozyme-directed cleavage of RNA S14 at a concentra-
tion of 1–2 108M (lanes 9–11). The basic Tat peptides
(44–61) and (48–86) only slightly enhanced ribozyme-
directed cleavage of S14 RNA (lanes 15 and 18), and levels
were only a ﬁfth of that with Tat protein at peptide
concentration of 1 107M (see ﬁgure 5 legend). The Tat
peptides (1–20) and (21–43) were inactive even at
1 107M (lane 12 and data not shown). As expected,
RNA template S20 was not cleaved and there was no
enhancement of ribozyme cleavage by Tat under these
conditions (data not shown; 49).
Tat enhances RNA trans-splicing
To evaluate the role of the Tat chaperoning activity in
splicing (21) we used the previously established trans-
splicing assay (33,50), where the pre-mRNA of the

basic petides (44–61) and (48–86) were only poorly active in this

peptides at 2 107M amounted to 15–20% of that with Tat protein at
a concentration of 1 108M. RNA template S20 was not cleaved and
there was no enhancement of ribozyme cleavage by HIV-1 NCp7 and
Tat under these conditions (data not shown and see previously

intron was split into two halves. The ﬁrst RNA transcript,
H1, corresponds to the 50 exon sequence of 549 nt and
131 nt of the intron while the second RNA transcript, H2,
corresponds to the 30 part of the intron (147 nt) and part of
exon 2 (23 nt) (Figure 6A). The two RNAs were 35S-UMP
labelled during transcription and were incubated together.
Reactions were started by adding 32P-GTP, so that the
resulting spliced RNA was doubly labelled, internally and
at the 50 end with 32P-GTP (Figure 6A). In the absence of
protein, the reaction was carried out at 558C to allow a
productive interaction between H1 and H2 RNAs. Trans-
splicing was indeed found to take place at 558C but only to
a limited extend (data not shown and refs 33,50) but not at
378C according to the accumulation of 32P-GTP-I1 ﬁnal
product (lane 1 in Figure 6B and C).
HIV-1 NCp7 strongly stimulated trans-splicing (lanes
2–5), with an optimal enhancement at a concentration of
8 107M (panel B, lane 4). Mutant NC(12–53) was
found to be poorly active even at 2 106M (panel B,
lane 7).
Tat protein was found to be a strong activator of trans-
splicing (Figure 6C, lanes 2–6), with an optimal activation
at concentrations of 4–8 107M (lanes 4 and 5).
Interestingly the Tat peptide (44–61) also strongly
activated trans-splicing (Figure 6C, lanes 9–12) at
concentrations of 2–4 107M (lanes 9 and 10) while
the Tat peptide (48–86) was less eﬃcient in activating
trans-splicing at 8 107M (lanes 15 and 16). Tat peptide
(1–20) was totally inactive in the trans-splicing assay even
at a concentration of 2 106M (compare lanes 7 and 8
with lane 1 in Figure 6C).
DISCUSSION
The Tat protein plays a pivotal role in HIV-1 replication
by strongly transactivating proviral DNA transcription,
which necessitates the binding of Tat to the 50 trans-
activation response element (TAR) of the nascent viral
RNA (9). This in turn causes the recruitment of the
positive elongation factor P-TEFB allowing the rapid
synthesis of the full-length HIV-1 mRNA by RNAP II
and the cyclic reuse of the viral promoter (16–19,51–53).
The interplay of Tat with the viral RNA extends beyond
transcription activation since Tat also inﬂuences viral
mRNA capping and splicing (20,21). In agreement with
the view that Tat is multi-functional, it was recently found
that Tat can suppress the cellular RNA interference
machinery by interacting with DICER, TRBP, siRNA
and the mRNA (22,23).
A computer analysis of Tat predicts that this small basic
protein is essentially unstructured and thus belongs to the
growing family of intrinsically unstructured proteins
(IUP) (Supplementary Figure 1, ref. 25). A disordered
nature of a protein is thought to render possible
interactions with multiple molecular partners (28,54,55),
which may account for diﬀerent functions as in the case of
retroviral NC proteins (56). Intrinsic disorder may also be
important for the nucleic acid chaperone activity of Tat,
contributing folding energy to nucleic acid rearrange-
ment by way of an entropy exchange mechanism (40).
Interestingly, the majority of proteins involved in tran-
scription regulation was found to contain long disordered
regions, indicating that protein chain ﬂexibility is pivotal
for this function (57,58). To better understand the
multiple roles of Tat, we have investigated in vitro its
interplay with nucleic acids, notably with DNA, RNA and
DNA–RNA hybrid molecules.
Results reported here show that Tat has potent DNA
and RNA chaperoning activities as evidenced by its ability
to strongly enhance DNA–DNA annealing and exchange
(Figures 3 and 4), ribozyme-directed cleavage of an RNA
substrate (Figure 5) and RNA trans-splicing (Figure 6). In
agreement with these ﬁndings, Tat can activate an RNA–
DNA exchange within an RNA–DNA hybrid represent-
ing the HIV-1 promoter sequences (Supplementary
Figure 2). Interestingly, Tat has a window of chaperoning
activity corresponding to about one protein per 20 to 40 nt
(Figures 2–6), also found for HIV-1 NC protein with
similar values of window of activity (see Figure 5 for
example and ref. 46). Previously, Guo et al. (59) reported
that Tat could replace the HIV-1 NC protein in the
initiation of reverse transcription by promoting primer
tRNALys,3 placement onto the primer binding site and
strand transfer in vitro. However, the relevance of these
ﬁndings is still a matter of speculation, because only very
small amounts of Tat are found in virions (60). Else Tat
could well activate the intra-cellular viral DNA synthesis,
which occurs in the case of HIV-1 with mutations in the
NC zinc ﬁnger motifs (61).
Taken together, these results indicate that Tat is a
nucleic acid chaperone with potent nucleic acid annealing
and strand-displacement activities, that may act at the
levels of proviral DNA transcription, viral RNA splicing
and suppression of silencing (Figures 3–6) (8,9,21–23).
In an attempt to map the Tat sequences responsible for
the chaperoning activities, we used peptides representing
the N-terminal domain, peptide 1–20, the cysteine-rich
domain, peptide 21–43, part of the core and nucleic acid-
binding domains, peptide (44–61), and the nucleic acid-
binding region together with the C-terminal fragment
(48–86). We also used smaller Tat peptides, namely
(44–57) and (48–61) (see Supplementary Data).
Interestingly, the Tat peptide (44–61) was found to be
almost as active as the Tat protein in three chaperoning
assays (Figures 2, 3, 5 and 6). However, the use of a large
panel of assays to dissect the chaperoning activities
allowed us to ﬁnd that the Tat peptides (44–61), (44–57),
(48–61) and (48–86) were poorly active in the ribozyme-
directed cleavage of an RNA substrate (Figure 5B,
Supplementary Figure 3 and Table 3). This assay monitors
three reactions that are RNA annealing and cleavage, and
the release of the end products to allow a cyclic reuse of
the R3 ribozyme (Figure 5A and Materials and methods
section). Yet, we do not know what is the limiting step for
the Tat peptides (44–61) and (48–86) in the ribozyme-
directed cleavage reaction (Figure 5A). RNA chaperoning
is a complex process, that involves molecular crowding
achieved via the formation of nucleoprotein complexes
(Figures 2 and 3; refs 46,62) where annealing of
complementary strands and eventually their destabiliza-
tion can take place (Figure 5). The degree of RNA

Figure 6. Enhancement of trans-splicing by HIV-1 Tat. (A) Schematic representation of the trans-splicing assay: The two RNA constructs H1
(encoding exon 1 and the 50 part of the intron) and H2 (encoding the 30 part of the intron and exon 2) have to fold into a splicing competent
structure (1). The splicing reaction was started by addition of the 32P-labeled GTP. The nucleic acid chaperone was eventually added at step 2. The
ﬁnal RNA products are represented in (4). The splicing rates are based on the levels of GTP-I1 (see B). (B and C) Assays where the H1 and H2
RNAs were incubated with or without a nucleic acid chaperone. At the end of the reaction RNAs were phenol treated to remove the protein and
analysed by PAGE in denaturing conditions (see Materials and methods section). The RNA substrates (H1, H2), the ligated exons (E1-E2) and the
product (guanosine-50-intron G-I1) are indicated. Panel B. Lane 1: splicing reaction at 378C with RNA alone at a concentration of 4 108M. Lanes

occupancy by Tat peptides (44–61) and (48–86) is thought
to be higher than that by Tat protein because the peptides
bind 5 nt while it is 8 nt for the complete Tat protein
(Figure 2). This could preclude the release of the cleaved
RNA substrate and thus the cyclic reuse of the ribozyme.
Strand displacement and release could be inﬂuenced by
the cysteine-rich domain (Figure 1) as suggested by the
work of Guo et al. (59) on DNA strand displacement, but
this remains to be demonstrated.
Our results also show that the 18-residue-long peptide
(Tat 44–61) is the smallest known peptide with most, but
not all, DNA/RNA chaperoning properties (Table 3). The
use of such a small peptide should facilitate high-
throughput screening aimed at identifying small molecules
capable of inhibiting Tat and thus HIV-1 proviral DNA
transcription and viral RNA splicing. This is presently in
progress.
