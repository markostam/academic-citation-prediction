ABSTRACT
Numerous regulatory genes have G-rich regions
that can potentially form quadruplex structures,
possibly playing a role in transcription regulation.
We studied a G-rich sequence in the BCL2
gene 176-bp upstream of the P1 promoter for
G-quadruplex formation. Using circular dichroism
(CD), thermal denaturation and dimethyl sulfate
(DMS) footprinting, we found that a single-
stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence of the
BCL2 G-rich region forms a potassium-stabilized
G-quadruplex. To study G-quadruplex formation in
double-stranded DNA, the G-rich sequence of
the BCL2 gene was inserted into plasmid DNA. We
found that a G-quadruplex did not form in the insert
at physiological conditions. To induce G-quadruplex
formation, we used short peptide nucleic acids
(PNAs) that bind to the complementary C-rich
strand. We examined both short duplex-forming
PNAs, complementary to the central part of the
BCL2 gene, and triplex-forming bis-PNAs, comple-
mentary to sequences adjacent to the G-rich BCL2
region. Using a DMS protection assay, we
demonstrated G-quadruplex formation within the
G-rich sequence from the promoter region of the
human BCL2 gene in plasmid DNA. Our results
show that molecules binding the complementary
C-strand facilitate G-quadruplex formation and
introduce a new mode of PNA-mediated sequence-
specific targeting.
INTRODUCTION
The BCL2 gene, named after B-cell lymphoma 2, encodes
an apoptosis inhibitor protein. BCL2 protein is localized
on the mitochondrial membrane and helps maintain
the delicate balance between programmed cell death and
survival. Due to its role in apoptosis regulation, the BCL2
gene is an important target in anticancer treatment
using pro-apoptotic drugs. Increased levels of BCL2
mRNA are found in many human cancers, such as
B- and T-cell lymphomas (1), breast (2), cervical (3),
lung (4) and prostate/colorectal cancers (5). Thus, the
BCL2 gene is included in the proto-oncogene family as
a potent factor inhibiting apoptosis (6). Furthermore,
insuﬃcient expression of the BCL2 gene may lead to
increased apoptotic activity in cells resulting in various
degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (7),
Alzheimer’s disease (8), Parkinson’s disease (9), stroke
(10) and spinal cord injuries (11).
The human BCL2 gene has two promoters, P1 and P2
(12). P1, the major promoter, is located 1.3- to 1.5-kbp
upstream of the translation start site (spanning from
3934 to 1280 bp). Although it has a few TATA
regions, the P1 promoter is mainly GC rich, with
numerous transcription initiation sites. The P2 promoter
has multiple TATA regions and is located 1.3-kbp down-
stream of P1. Recently, another promoter (designated as
M) was discovered in the region between P1 and P2 sites.
Promoter M acts in a p53-dependent manner and has
suppressive activity on P1 and P2 promoters (13). P2
and M promoters apparently modulate P1 activity, while
P1 appears to be the main driving force regulating BCL2
transcription.
Hurley et al. (14, 15) describe the formation of
quadruplex structures in a GC-rich region located 58
to 19 bp upstream of the BCL2 P1 promoter (indicated
on Figure 1 as bcl2G4-1). Multiple transcription factors
bind to this region, which suggests its importance for P1
promoter regulation (16–18). For our study, we selected
another G-rich sequence from the BCL2 gene pro-
moter located 176-bp upstream of P1 promoter that
exhibited G-quadruplex forming potential. We refer to
this sequence as bcl2G4-2 (Figure 1).

Guanine-rich sequences with quadruplex forming
potential are located in the promoter regions of numerous
genes, especially regulatory genes (19). Quadruplex forma-
tion has been examined in several genes such as PDGF-A
(20,21), VEGF (21–23), c-myc (21,24), KRAS (25), BCL2
(14,15). In most cases, G-quadruplex formation was
studied in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides
under various conditions in vitro. Data on G-quadruplex
formation in double-stranded (ds) plasmids are rare, likely
reﬂecting a lower potential for these structures to form
under supercoiling stress conditions compared with other
non-B DNA conformations such as Z-DNA or H-DNA
triplex (26,27). One of the ﬁrst examples of quadruplex
formation in plasmids was observed by electron micros-
copy. The authors developed a plasmid with guanine-rich
inserts and observed a ‘G-loop’ DNA/RNA hybrid on the
C-rich strand and a G-quadruplex on the complimentary
strand. They concluded that the RNA/DNA hybrid
was critical for G-quadruplex stabilization in the post-
transcriptional G-loops (28).
In this article, we report the formation of
G-quadruplexes in ds plasmid DNA when peptide
nucleic acids (PNAs) bind to the complementary
C-strand. PNAs are nucleic acid mimics with the canoni-
cal nucleobases connected to an achiral, uncharged poly-
amide backbone (29,30). PNA forms very stable duplexes
and triplexes with complementary DNA, displacing the
complementary DNA strand in DNA duplexes and
producing so-called PD-loops (31–33). We designed short
duplex- and triplex-forming PNAs that are able to invade
dsDNAof theBCL2 gene by selectively binding to the com-
plementary cytosine-rich sequence, thus promoting quad-
ruplex formation in the guanine-rich segments. Because the
anticipated quadruplex would be solely DNA, this
approach diﬀers from strategies targeting G-rich sequences
by forming PNA/DNA hybrid quadruplexes (34–36).
Initially, we examined the G-quadruplex forming poten-
tial of a single-stranded sequence from the guanine-rich
region of the BCL2 gene (bcl2G4-2) in vitro. We then
inserted the bcl2G4-2 sequence into plasmid DNA and
studied whether quadruplexes could form in the G-rich
strand of dsDNA in diﬀerent conditions. Speciﬁcally,
we employed several types of PNA oligomers and the
quadruplex-stabilizing drug telomestatin. Our results
show that PNA binding to the complementary C-strand
is required for the G-quadruplex formation in the G-rich
strand and suggest a new mode of sequence-speciﬁc
targeting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA oligonucleotides
The DNA oligonucleotides (Table 1) were synthesized on
an ABI394 DNA synthesizer (PE Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA), and puriﬁed by denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described
previously (37). The absorbance of single-stranded
oligonucleotide solutions were measured at 260 nm on
an HP 8452A Diode Array Spectrophotometer, and the
concentrations were calculated with extinction coeﬃcient
calculator software (http://www.basic.northwestern.
edu/biotools/oligocalc.html). Several guanosines in
BCL2doublePPG (marked as P) were substituted with
8-aza-7-deaza-20-deoxyguanosine (PPG) (38). Partially
duplex DNA oligonucleotides were obtained by annealing
of complementary strands by slow cooling from 95C to
room temperature. The DNA oligonucleotides were
incubated in 20mM Tris–HCl buﬀer solution (pH 7.4)
at 37C for 1 h and in the presence or absence of
100mM NaCl or 100mM KCl.
PNAs
Bis-PNAs were purchased from Panagene, South Korea.
Central-binding PNAs (two short G-rich sequences) were
synthesized via Boc-mediated solid phase synthesis on a
433A Automated Peptide Synthesizer from Applied
Biosystems (39). Boc-protected PNA monomers were pur-
chased from PE Applied Biosystems. PNA oligomer
quality was tested using an HP 1050 high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrophoto-
metrically (HP 8452A Diode Array Spectrophotometer).
PNA concentration was measured at 260 nm on an HP
8452A Diode Array Spectrophotometer, and was calcu-
lated with extinction coeﬃcient calculator software
(http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc
.html). Prior to all experiments, PNAs were incubated in a
shaker for 15min at 42C and their concentration was
measured before mixing with DNA samples. PNA
sequences are presented in Table 2.
Plasmids
Plasmids carrying the appropriate inserts were obtained
by cloning of the BCL2single oligonucleotide (the same
G-rich sequence with short TTCCTTT regions for
triplex formation with bis-PNAs) with the corresponding
complementary strand into pCR-Blunt vector using the
Zero Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Constructs were incorporated and ampliﬁed using
the One Shot TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia
coli (Invitrogen) and selected with 50 mg/ml kanamycin.
Plasmid DNA was puriﬁed using the Plasmid Maxi Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). All procedures were
performed according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions. Plasmids were additionally puriﬁed by ultracen-
trifugation in a CsCl gradient (40). All plasmids were
sequenced to conﬁrm the desired insertion using the
Maxam–Gilbert sequencing procedure (41). Incubation
of plasmids with PNAs was performed in 20mM
potassium acetate (pH 5.2) with or without 10mM
telomestatin at 37C overnight with molar ratio 100:1
PNA to DNA.
Dimethyl sulfate footprinting of oligonucleotides
DNA oligonucleotides were 50-32P-labeled with [g-32P]-
ATP (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) by T4
polynucleotide kinase using standard protocol followed
by puriﬁcation on G-25 microcolumns (GE Healthcare,
UK). After incubation under various conditions, samples
were probed with 2ml 10% dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in
ethanol for 15min at 15C. The reaction was terminated

with stop solution on ice (1.5M sodium acetate, pH 5.2,
1M b-mercaptoethanol, 100 mg/ml yeast tRNA) followed
by ethanol precipitation and washing with 70% ethanol.
After incubation in 10% piperdine at 95C for 20min
and repeated lyophilizations, samples were analyzed
by electrophoresis in 12% denaturing polyacrylamide
gels. Gels were quantiﬁed using BAS-2500 Bioimager
(FUJI Medical Systems USA, Stamford, CT, USA). To
measure the intensity of the individual bands, the intensity
proﬁle of each lane was generated from the digitized gel
image using Image Gauge software (FUJI Medical
Systems USA). Band intensities were normalized with
control samples (Tris–HCl buﬀer), inverse values are
presented.
Thermal denaturation spectrophotometry
Absorbance spectra measurements were performed on
an HP 8452A Diode Array Spectrophotometer. DNA
oligonucleotides were placed in quartz cuvettes with an
optical path length of 1 cm. Absorbance spectra were
recorded in 220–335 nm range from 90C to 20C during
slow cooling down of the samples (0.5C per min) in the
presence of 100 mM KCl in 20mM Tris–HCl buﬀer
solution (pH 7.4). Spectra at 90C were subtracted from
those at 20C and normalized on oligonucleotide concen-
tration. The temperature-dependant absorbance at 295 nm
was also recorded.
Circular dichroism spectroscopy
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra measurements were per-
formed on Jasco J-810 spectrophotometer in a 2-mm path
length cuvette and a wavelength scanning speed of
100 nm/min. DNA oligonucleotides were incubated for
G-quadruplex formation as described above. CD spectra
of samples in the presence of 100mM KCl and 20mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) were measured at 20C in the range
from 200 nM to 320 nM. The spectra (the averages of
three scans) were corrected on blank buﬀer spectra and
normalized on oligonucleotide concentration.
Chemical probing of plasmid DNA
Plasmid DNA samples contained 1 mg of plasmid in
40mM TE buﬀer (pH 7.4) with or without 100mM KCl
and 100mM NaCl or 20mM potassium acetate (pH 5.2).
Plasmids incubated with PNAs were chemically modiﬁed
to a total volume of 50ml with 2.5mM OsO4 plus 2.5mM
2.20-dipyridyl disulﬁde for 5 min at room temperature,
with 2 ml diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) for 5min at
room temperature, or with 2 ml 10% DMS in ethanol for
15 min at 15C. Reactions were terminated with stop
solution on ice (1.5M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 1M b-
mercaptoethanol and 100 mg/ml yeast tRNA) followed
by ethanol precipitation and washing with 70% ethanol.
Modiﬁed plasmids were cut by incubation with Fast
Digest SpeI and Kpn1 restriction enzymes (Fermentas,
Hanover, MD, USA) for 1 h at 37C followed by 30-32P-
labeling with [a-32P]-dCTP (Perkin Elmer) by Klenow
fragment of DNA polymerase I (Fermentas). After puri-
ﬁcation on G-50 microcolumns (GE Healthcare) followed
by incubation in 10% piperidine at 95C for 20min and
repeated lyophilizations, samples were analyzed by
electrophoresis on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels
without fragment puriﬁcation, allowing the shorter
fragment to run oﬀ the gel. For DMS protection
analysis, intensities of bands corresponding to guanines
were measured and normalized on that of guanines
outside G-rich sequence.
RESULTS
Formation of G-quadruplex structures by G-rich
strands of BCL2 gene
To test the possibility of G-quadruplex formation in the
BCL2 guanine-rich sequence, we synthesized ssDNA with
the sequences from the region of BCL2 176-bp upstream
of the P1 promoter (bcl2G4-2, Figure 1). The guanine-rich
region bcl2G4-2 was adjacent to a short ds portion of the
molecule to better mimic conditions in a plasmid and to
prevent single-strand tail interaction, possibly aﬀecting
quadruplex formation (42). The resulting BCL2double
is a partially ds oligonucleotide with a single-stranded
G-rich region with seven guanine runs (Table 1). For
a positive control, T2G4double oligonucleotide was
synthesized, which has a ds part similar to BCL2double
and a single-stranded G-rich region from Tetrahymena
thermophila telomeres. For a negative control, we
synthesized an oligomer containing multiple PPG

nucleoside units (BCL2doublePPG). The PPG guanine
analog lacks N7 nitrogen, eliminating the possibility
of hydrogen bonding to the Hoogsteen face, thus pre-
cluding quadruplex formation (38). Oligonucleotide
sequences are presented in Table 1. Runs of guanines
are marked with roman numerals from I to VII; PPGs
are marked as ‘P’.
CD spectroscopy
CD spectroscopy studies were performed to obtain
evidence for the presence of G-quadruplex structures in
the BCL2 sequence. CD spectroscopy has been widely
used for the characterization of G-quadruplex-forming
oligonucleotides (43,44). We acquired CD spectra of
BCL2double and BCL2doublePPG in 100mM KCl and
20mM Tris–HCl buﬀer (pH 7.4) at 20C. DNA
oligonucleotides were incubated for G-quadruplex forma-
tion in the buﬀer solution at 37C for 1 h. Data are shown
in Figure 2. The solid line represents the CD spectrum of
BCL2double, while a dashed line represents the control,
BCL2doublePPG. The BCL2double CD spectrum has
a prominent positive peak at 260 nm and a negative
peak at 240 nm. However, the CD spectrum of
BCL2doublePPG is almost ﬂat, lacking distinguishable
maxima or minima. The lack of ellipticity evidenced in
BCL2doublePPG can be attributed to the lack of N7
nitrogen hydrogen bonding capabilities, eliminating the
possibility of quadruplex formation. CD spectra are gen-
erally aﬀected by the orientation of guanine residues
relative to the sugar moieties, so that parallel and
antiparallel quadruplexes can be distinguished. Based on
the spectra of short G-rich telomeric oligonucleotides that
form tetramolecular parallel structures, the positive peak
near 260 nm and negative peak near 240 nm are character-
istic for the parallel G-quadruplex conformation (45–47).
Based on these data, the BCL2double sequence forms
G-quadruplexes in the presence of potassium ions with a
CD spectrum resembling that of parallel quadruplex.

Thermal denaturation
Further spectroscopic evidence for the presence of
G-quadruplex structures in the BCL2 promoter region
was obtained from annealing studies of BCL2double and
BCL2doublePPG. Absorbance spectra were recorded in
220–335 nm range at 20C and 90C during slow cooling
of the samples (0.5C per min) in the presence of 100mM
KCl in 20mM Tris–HCl buﬀer solution (pH 7.4).
Figure 3A shows data for BCL2double, and Figure 3B
for BCL2doublePPG. The renaturation curve at 295 nm
reveals a transition with melting temperature (Tm) of
60C (Figure 3A, upper panel) for BCL2double. No
melting transition was evident for BCL2doublePPG.
Spectra at 90C were subtracted from those at 20C and
normalized on oligonucleotide concentration. It was
previously described that diﬀerential absorbance spectra
of G-quadruplex structures have a characteristic peak in
absorbance at 295 nm (48). This peak is observed in the
case of BCL2double along with the expected negative peak
for oligonucleotides at 260 nm (Figure 3A, bottom panel).
However, the diﬀerential spectrum of BCL2doublePPG
lacks the peak at 295 nm (Figure 3B, bottom panel).
Thus, thermal denaturation studies support G-quadruplex
formation in the BCL2double sequence in potassium-
containing buﬀer.
Chemical probing
For further evidence of G-quadruplex formation, we
probed BCL2double and T2G4double with DMS (see
‘Materials and Methods’ section). This assay detects
guanines in a G-quadruplex due to protection of their
N7 positions from DMS modiﬁcation. Samples were
probed in 100mM KCl, 20mM Tris–HCl buﬀer
solution (pH 7.4) and analyzed in 12% denaturing
PAGE (Figure 4, right panel). The intensity of the indi-
vidual bands in gels was measured and normalized to
control samples probed with DMS in the same Tris–HCl
buﬀer without KCl. The inverse values are presented on
the graph (Figure 4). Both oligonucleotides tend to form
G-quadruplex structures in the presence of potassium
ions after incubation at 37C for 1 h. DMS protection
is observed in the range of 60–90% (quantiﬁed for
BCL2double) depending on the position of guanines
along the sequence. Guanines with a higher degree of
protection that apparently participate in G-quadruplex
formation are marked with asterisks. They correspond
to the G-runs II, III, V and VI. Incubation of
BCL2double and T2G4double in 100mM NaCl at 37C
for 1 h resulted in strong DMS protection of guanines in
T2G4double and very weak DMS protection in the case of
BCL2double (very close to control without NaCl). These
results suggest that T2G4double forms G-quadruplex
structures in the presence of both potassium and sodium
ions (Supplementary Figure S1), while BCL2double
formed quadruplexes only in the presence of potassium.
G-quadruplex formation in plasmids
After showing evidence that the G-rich sequence of the
BCL2 promoter has the potential to form G-quadruplexes
in single-stranded oligonucleotides, we extended our
studies of these structures to ds plasmid DNA. We used
several chemical probes to quantify local dsDNA melting

at the desired location. First, we probed DNA with OsO4
and DEPC, allowing us to determine if thymines and
adenines, respectively, are open within the insert.
Second, we used DMS probing to reveal quadruplex
formation from the protection at the N7 position. We
used plasmid samples with natural superhelical density.
Samples were incubated in the presence or absence of
100mM KCl, 100mM NaCl and 10 mM telomestatin for
1 h at 37C. Probing with DEPC and OsO4 did not
show local melting in the insert region (Supplementary
Figure S2). Overall, we were not able to detect any
evidence of stable local DNA melting or G-quadruplex
formation within the insert in the presence of potassium,
sodium or telomestatin.
G-quadruplex formation in plasmids incubated with PNA
Because local melting conditions likely contribute to the
quadruplex formation in plasmid DNA, PNA probes were
designed and synthesized to selectively bind the cytosine-
rich complementary strand of the guanine-rich BCL2
sequence. Two PNA designs were employed: bis-PNAs
that form triplexes with DNA regions bordering the
guanine-rich region and central-binding PNAs (cPNAs)
that form duplexes to the complementary cytosine-rich
strand directly across from the quadruplex forming
region. The PNAs used are presented in Table 2, and
the concept is depicted in Figure 5. Since triplex-forming
PNAs require a polypurine–polypyrimidine sequence, we
added TTTCCTT regions to both ends of the G-rich
sequence (BCL2single, Table 1). Incubation of plasmids
with or without PNAs and with or without telomestatin
was performed in 20mM potassium acetate (pH 5.2) at
37C overnight with molar ratio 100:1 PNA to DNA. Low
pH buﬀer was used because protonated cytosines are
required for stable triplex formation. Figure 6 represents
the results of probing the plasmid DNA with a
BCL2single insert with OsO4, DEPC and DMS. Only
the G-rich strand was analyzed. Samples were probed in
20mM KOAc, pH 5.2. Probing procedures were the same
as in the previous step of the experiment. Control samples
were incubated only in KOAc buﬀer (lanes 1, 7 and 13).
Experimental samples were incubated with bis-PNAs
(lanes 3, 9 and 15), central-binding PNAs (lanes 2, 8 and
14), both PNA types (lanes 4, 10 and 16), both PNA types
with 10 mM telomestatin (lanes 5, 11 and 17) and only
10 mM telomestatin (lanes 6, 12 and 18). Lanes 1–6, 7–12
and 13–18 show probing with OsO4, DEPC and DMS,
respectively. Results suggest stable binding of bis-PNAs
and central-binding PNAs to naturally supercoiled
plasmid DNA. Data in Figure 6 clearly demonstrate

local melting of the targeted DNA region with opening of
the G-rich strand. OsO4 modiﬁcations of thymines in lanes
3, 4 and 5 correspond to binding of bis-PNA openers to
the complementary C-rich strand, while OsO4 modiﬁca-
tion of thymines in lanes 2, 4 and 5 correspond to
binding of cPNAs to the central part of the complemen-
tary strand within the insert. Lanes 8, 10 and 11 reveal
opening of adenines as a result of cPNA invasion and
binding to the complementary strand of the insert. The
highest yield of modiﬁcation was observed with a combi-
nation of both bis-PNA openers and central-binding
PNAs with and without telomestatin (lanes 4, 5, 10 and
11 in Figure 6).
Next, we tested for G-quadruplex formation using a
DMS protection assay. We measured the intensity of the
individual bands after DMS probing (lanes 12–18) and
normalized to guanines outside the G-rich sequence.
Guanine protection from DMS was observed in all exper-
imental lanes (lanes 14–17 in Figure 6) except for the
sample incubated with only telomestatin (lane 18). The
panel on the left in Figure 6 represents quantiﬁed
data for DMS protection assay. Incubation with
telomestatin alone did not lead to DMS protection; on
the contrary, guanines were modiﬁed at a slightly higher
rate. Samples incubated with PNAs showed a signiﬁcant
protection from DMS methylation. The most eﬀective
protection appeared to be in the case of incubation with

only cPNAs (up to 70%). Incubation with bis-PNAs led to
a slight guanine modiﬁcation decrease by 30%, probably
as a result of insuﬃcient local DNA melting in the central
part of the insert. Interestingly, combination of bis-PNA
openers and central-binding PNAs did not result in
the highest DMS protection, even with addition of
telomestatin (two lower panels in Figure 6); a decrease
in DMS modiﬁcation was observed at the level of
50–60%. The highest DMS protection was observed in
the guanine runs II, III, V, VI and VII.
Based on these data, we believe that short PNAs
binding to the complementary C-strand result in local
DNA melting. This allows the G-rich strand to form
G-quadruplexes in the presence of potassium ions, and
this change was revealed by increased guanine N7 protec-
tion from DMS modiﬁcation.
DISCUSSION
BCL2 is a potent oncogene that has a key role in
apoptosis. Its overexpression is correlated with an
increased chance of cancer transformation, progression
and resistance to anticancer treatment. Several approaches
have been explored to control BCL2 expression, such as
targeting the BCL2 gene with triplex-forming oligo-
nucleotides (49), antisense oligonucleotides (50) and
inhibiting protein–protein interactions (51). A novel
concept for gene-targeted therapy is based on the
hypothesis that G-rich regions within gene promoters
under certain conditions can form G-quadruplexes.
Quadruplex structures could interact with transcription
factors that regulate expression of these genes.
Sequences with repeated guanine runs, with the potential
to form quadruplexes, are overrepresented in the human
genome (52). Tumor suppressor genes have very low levels
of this type of sequence, while proto-oncogenes have very
high levels of repeated guanine runs. G-rich regions have
been found and studied in promoter regions of PDGF
(20,21), c-myc (21,24), VEGF (21-23), KRAS (25) and
BCL2 (14,15).
In our study, we presented evidence for G-quadruplex
formation in a second guanine-rich region of the
BCL2 gene in dsDNA. We designed a partially ds
oligonucleotide with a single-stranded BCL2 sequence
overhang (BCL2double), and showed that this segment
forms G-quadruplex structures. This was conﬁrmed via
DMS protection assay, thermal denaturing studies and
CD spectrometry. The hyperchromic eﬀect we observed
was relatively weak. However, it is within the same
order of magnitude as described in other quadruplex
studies (48). A modest hyperchromic eﬀect corresponds
to incomplete DMS protection of guanines, which can
indicate highly dynamic quadruplex formation. DMS pro-
tection was observed at the level of 60–90%, which
suggests that the quadruplex structures are not entirely
stable or that oligomers are switching between several
types of possible G-quadruplex structures. Based solely
on the CD data obtained, it is diﬃcult to conﬁrm the
type of G-quadruplex structure observed, because there
are several feasible quadruplex conformations (both
intra- and inter-molecular) involving diﬀerent runs
of guanines in BCL2double. However, based on CD
spectrometry, it appears a parallel quadruplex conforma-
tion predominates.
Next, we examined whether the G-rich sequence from
the BCL2 promoter region is still able to form a
quadruplex after being inserted into a plasmid. We
probed the plasmid with DMS, OsO4 and DEPC,
excised and labeled the G-rich strand and studied the
breaks resulting from chemical modiﬁcations of the
bases. The idea was to observe local DNA melting
within the insert region as a result of G-quadruplex for-
mation. KCl and telomestatin are known quadruplex
stabilizing agents, but there was no sign of DNA
melting within the insert; DNA remained double
stranded (data shown in Supplementary Data). We
inferred that the free energy provided by natural
supercoiling of the plasmid was not enough to stabilize
the G-quadruplex in the G-rich strand while the
C-strand remains open. If G-quadruplexes do play a role
in gene expression regulation in living cells, proteins that
stabilize guanine quadruplexes likely bind the complemen-
tary C-rich strand selectively or in some other way interact
with transcription machinery (24). For example, Duquette
et al. (28) observed quadruplex formation during tran-
scription. They suggested that a RNA/DNA hybrid in
the C-rich strand was responsible for the guanine-rich
strand release from duplex and the quadruplex formation.
However, it remains unclear whether quadruplex forma-
tion actually played any role in transcription regulation or
if its formation was a ‘side-eﬀect’ resulting from the
peculiar properties of this model. Future studies should
concentrate on interactions between nuclear proteins and
quadruplex forming DNA sequences to clarify the biolog-
ical role of G-quadruplexes in living cells.
We sought to examine guanine quadruplex formation
and stabilization utilizing short PNAs. PNAs are nucleic
acid mimics in which the phosphate–sugar backbone has
been replaced by N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine linkages (29).
PNAs are resistant to degradation from proteases and
nucleases and rarely interact with cellular proteins.
Because PNA is uncharged, it binds to complementary
DNA and RNA with higher binding aﬃnity and selectiv-
ity than natural nucleic acids. These properties make
PNA a promising tool for sequence-speciﬁc gene target-
ing. Another remarkable feature of PNAs is their ability
to invade dsDNA, forming so-called PD loops. This
phenomena was ﬁrst described by Nielsen et al. (29,53).
Later, a mechanism of invasion was proposed (54) where a
triplex between one PNA and two DNA strands is formed,
followed by invasion and local DNA melting. Other
experiments showed higher rates of strand invasion if
triplex-forming bis-homopyrimidine PNAs were used
(55,56). Interestingly, PNAs invade at higher rates to
targets in DNA where the displaced DNA strand can
form some sort of secondary structure (cruciform) (32).
We proposed a PNA binding design (Figure 5) imple-
menting bis-PNAs and ‘central-binding PNAs’ (Table 2).
Our experiments show consistent PNA binding, as
evidenced by the release of G-rich strands from the
DNA duplex based on OsO4 and DEPC-probing results

(Figure 6). It was shown that even with only bis-PNA
openers, one can observe a noticeable degree of DNA
melting in the central part of the insert. Thus, PNAs
were able to bind the C-rich strand of the BCL2 insert
and release the G-rich strand. Furthermore, we observed
quadruplex formation in the G-rich strand based on
results from DMS protection studies. The highest rate
(up to 70%) of G-quadruplex formation was observed
with only central-binding PNAs. The lowest rate was
30% with only bis-PNAs. As we have shown previously
(56), binding of two bis-PNA openers did not result in the
melting of the duplex region separating them.
Surprisingly, the combination of central-binding PNAs
and bis-PNAs led to protection from DMS at the level
of 50–60%, below the level of protection aﬀorded by
cPNAs alone. We expected the combination of both
types of PNA to produce the highest rates of quadruplex
formation due to the greater length of the guanine-rich
strand in single-stranded state. It is likely that other
factors aﬀect the ability of the released G-rich strand to
form quadruplexes, such as the ﬂexibility of the PNA/
DNA complex with the C-rich strand. By analyzing
DMS protection data, we cannot deﬁnitely determine
which guanines within the BCL2 segment contribute to
G-quadruplex formation. Presumably, within the studied
BCL2 guanine-rich promoter sequence, there are several
G-quadruplex formations involving various runs of
guanines.
Recently, several groups proposed the use of G-rich
quadruplex-forming PNA to target G-quadruplexes
directly (34–36,57–59). In this approach, G3 runs of
PNA are involved in quadruplex formation with the
G-rich strand of DNA. However, if there are proteins
that speciﬁcally recognize DNA G-quadruplexes for acti-
vation or inhibition of transcription, their binding
to the PNA/DNA hybrid G-quadruplex is uncertain.
We designed our central-binding PNA speciﬁcally to
minimize G-quadruplex formation. Although we cannot
completely exclude the possibility of the quadruplex for-
mation between central-binding PNA and the G-strand
in our experiment, our goal was to extrude a native
G-quadruplex in the G-rich region of the promoter to
subsequently study its eﬀect on the expression of the
BCL2 gene.
In conclusion, we induce G-quadruplex formation
in the guanine-rich promoter region of the human
BCL2 gene by C-strand-invading PNAs. Our results
demonstrate a new mode of sequence-speciﬁc gene
targeting using short, duplex- and triplex-forming
PNAs. This approach could provide a basis for future
applications of gene expression regulation through
G-quadruplex stabilization. In future studies, we plan to
implement these PNAs for in vivo studies concerning reg-
ulation of the BCL2 promoter through G-quadruplex
stabilization.
