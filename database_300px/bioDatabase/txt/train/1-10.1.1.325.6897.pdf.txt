The osmolarity of the extracellular space (ECS) compart-
ment is an important factor determining the excitability of
neuronal tissue. In the adult hippocampus an important
role of osmolarity and ECS diffusion parameters on the
susceptibility to epileptic events is well established, but
the inﬂuence of hypo- and hyperosmolar conditions on
the immature hippocampus remains elusive. To investi-
gate the inﬂuence of osmolarity on epileptiform activity,
extracellular ﬁeld potentials were recorded in the CA3
region of hippocampal slices of immature (postnatal days
4–7) Wistar rats. The ECS diffusion parameters were
determined by the real-time tetramethylammonium (TMAþ)
iontophoretic method with ion-selective microelectrodes
in immature hippocampal slices and showed a lack of
diffusion anisotropy; a tortuosity of about 1.39; and a
volume fraction, a, of 0.41 6 0.01 (n ¼ 10 slices). A
reduction in osmolarity of –90 mOsm induced a
decrease in a to 0.17 6 0.02 (n ¼ 4 slices). The fre-
quency of epileptiform activity elicited in 10–50 lM 4-
AP-containing low-Mg2þ solution was increased under –
90 mOsm and –40 mOsm hypoosmolar conditions by
39.9% 6 8.1% (n ¼ 16) and 24.1% 6 4.8% (n ¼ 10),
respectively, whereas hyperosmolar solutions decreased
the frequency. A –90-mOsm reduction in the osmolarity
of low-Mg2þ solution induced epileptiform activity in
nine of 19 slices. In summary, these results demonstrate
that hypoosmolar conditions increased excitability and
susceptibility to epileptiform activity in immature hippo-
campal slices, suggesting a functional role of the larger
a in suppression of seizures. VC 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Seizure frequency is higher in children than in adults
(Moshe, 1987; Glauser, 1995; Sanchez and Jensen, 2001).
Although the majority of the seizures in children have a
symptomatic origin, such as fever (Nelson and Ellenberg,
1976; Cowan, 2002) or hypoxia (McNamara, 1979), these
seizures may affect cognitive functions and have been
identiﬁed as one risk factor for the development of epi-
lepsy (Holmes, 1997). It has been suggested that poorly
developed GABA-ergic inhibition may facilitate the gen-
eration of epileptiform activity (Luhmann and Prince,
1991; Sanchez and Jensen, 2001; for review see Cossart
et al., 2005). In addition, other properties of immature
cortical neurons, such as their higher input resistance, lon-
ger decay kinetics of glutamatergic synaptic inputs, and
polysynaptic NMDA-mediated activity, may enhance
excitatory synaptic inputs and thus contribute to this
hyperexcitability (Luhmann and Prince, 1990; Burgard
and Hablitz, 1993; Jensen, 1999; Swann and Hablitz,
2000). However, other properties of the immature corti-
cal network counteract these facilitating mechanisms. For
example, immature cortical networks have less well devel-
oped excitatory connections, and immature neurons dis-
play longer membrane time constants, action potentials
with a depolarized threshold, increased adaptation, and
lower frequencies (Deisz and Luhmann, 1995; Holmes,
1997).
An additional factor inﬂuencing the susceptibility of
neuronal networks to develop epileptic activity is the
extracellular space (ECS) volume fraction, a (Andrew,
1991). In the immature cerebral cortex of rodents, a is
about twice as large as in the adult (Lehmenkuhler et al.,
1993). This larger ECS is due to a lower density of neu-

rons; to incomplete gliogenesis, myelination, and vascula-
rization; and to a less well developed extracellular matrix
and may serve in the easier diffusion of growth factors and
extracellular signaling molecules required for the matura-
tion of the brain (Sykova, 2004). The larger a will reduce
the excitability by attenuating extracellular Kþ accumula-
tion, neurotransmitter transients, and ephaptic interactions
(Traynelis and Dingledine, 1989; Sykova et al., 2000; Fox
et al., 2004). However, a is highly inﬂuenced by the
osmolarity of the ECS compartment and by neuronal ac-
tivity (Andrew, 1991; Baraban et al., 1997; Schwartzkroin
et al., 1998; Sykova, 2004). Hypoosmolar conditions will
narrow the ECS because of cell swelling and will thus
increase the excitability, whereas hyperosmolar conditions
will widen the ECS and reduce the excitability (Sykova,
2004). Accordingly, an inﬂuence of osmolarity on neuro-
nal excitability has been shown in various studies in the
mature hippocampus (Andrew et al., 1989; Traynelis and
Dingledine, 1989; Saly and Andrew, 1993; Azouz et al.,
1997; Baraban and Schwartzkroin, 1998), whereas the
effect of hypo- and hyperosmolar conditions in the imma-
ture hippocampus is not yet known.
To elucidate the inﬂuence of osmolarity on the
excitability of the immature hippocampus, we investi-
gated the effect of hypo- and hyperosmolar solutions on
the ECS diffusion parameters and epileptiform activity in
the CA3 region of the immature rat hippocampus. We
determined the absolute value of a in the CA3 region
and demonstrated that hypoosmolar solutions reduced a,
increased the susceptibility to epileptiform discharges, and
enhanced the epileptiform activity evoked by the applica-
tion of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in low-Mg2þ solution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Slice Preparation
All experiments were conducted in accordance with EU
directive 86/609/EEC for the use of animals in research and
were approved by the local ethical committee. Wistar rat pups
of postnatal days 4–7 (P4–7) were obtained from a local
breeding facility and were deeply anesthetized with enﬂurane
(Ethrane; Abbot Laboratories, Wiesbaden, Germany). The
brains were quickly removed and immersed for 2–3 min in
ice-cold standard artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF; see
Table I for composition). Coronal slices (600 lm thickness)
including the hippocampus were cut on a vibratome (Sigmann
Elektronik, Heidelberg, Germany), and the slices were
trimmed, cut at the midline, and transferred to an interface-
type recording chamber, where they were continuously super-
fused with ACSF at a rate of 1–2 ml/min at 318C 6 18C.
The slices were allowed to recover for at least 1 hr under
these conditions. For the diffusion measurements, 400-lm
coronal slices were used, and the measurements were made in
a submerged chamber at room temperature.
Data Acquisition and Analysis
Extracellular ﬁeld potentials were recorded with tung-
sten microelectrodes (impedance 4–5 MO; FHC, Bowdoin-
ham, ME) in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA3
region. Signals were ampliﬁed by a purpose-built ampliﬁer,
low-pass ﬁltered at 3 kHz, and stored on a PC using an AD/
DA board (ITC-16; HEKA, Lamprecht, German) and TIDA
4.11 software (HEKA). Extracellular ﬁeld potentials were
recorded simultaneously from, maximally, four separate hippo-
campal slices and were analyzed independently. Slices that did
not respond with epileptiform activity upon the application of
50–100 lM 4-AP in low-Mg2þ solution were discarded from
analysis. All recordings were analyzed in the program Mini-
analysis 4.3.3 (Synaptosoft, Leonia, NJ). Epileptiform events
were identiﬁed according to their amplitude and shape by set-
ting the parameters of the MiniAnalysis program. The epilep-
tiform events identiﬁed by the software were inspected by
eye, unless the number of events was >1,000 and the error
rate in the ﬁrst 100 inspected events was less than 3%. Epilep-
tiform events were analyzed for their amplitude and frequency
(calculated from the interspike interval between an event and
its predecessor). Values are given as mean 6 SEM. For statisti-
cal analysis, paired and unpaired two-tailed t-tests and Fisher’s
exact tests were used. Signiﬁcance was assigned at a level of
0.05 or 0.01.
Measurements of the Extracellular Space
Volume and Tortuosity
The real-time iontophoretic method using ion-selective
microelectrodes (Nicholson and Phillips, 1981) was employed
to determine the extracellular space (ECS) diffusion parame-
ters: extracellular space volume fraction a (a ¼ ECS volume/
total tissue volume), tortuosity factor k (k2 ¼ D/ADC, where
D is the tetramethylammonium (TMAþ) free diffusion coefﬁ-

cient and ADC is the TMAþ apparent diffusion coefﬁcient in
the tissue), and nonspeciﬁc uptake (k0), representing the loss
of diffusing molecules from the ECS. The tortuosity factor
describes the geometry of the ECS and reﬂects how diffusion
is slowed by diffusion barriers in the ECS, such as cell proc-
esses, residual spaces, or the extracellular matrix (Chen and
Nicholson, 2000; Sykova, 2004).
During measurements, the extracellular marker TMAþ
(MW ¼ 74.1), to which cell membranes are relatively imper-
meable, was administered to the tissue by iontophoresis. The
concentration of TMAþ was measured in the ECS by a dou-
ble-barreled TMAþ-selective microelectrode. The tip of the
ion-sensitive barrel was ﬁlled with an ion exchanger (Corning
477317), and the rest of the barrel was back-ﬁlled with
100 mM TMAþ chloride. An electrode array was made by
gluing together a TMAþ-selective microelectrode and an ion-
tophoretic micropipette, which was ﬁlled with 100 mM
TMAþ chloride (Fig. 1A; for detailed description see Svoboda
and Sykova, 1991). The tip separation was 100–120 lm. The
iontophoresis parameters were þ20 nA bias current (con-
tinuously applied to maintain a constant electrode transport
number) with a þ180 nA current step of 60 sec duration to

Tetramethylammonium (TMAþ) was iontophorized into the tissue by
an iontophoretic micropipette, and its concentration was detected by

generate the diffusion curve. The values of the ECS volume
fraction a, tortuosity k, and nonspeciﬁc uptake k0 can be deter-
mined by ﬁtting the TMAþ diffusion curves using a nonlinear
curve-ﬁtting simplex algorithm (Nicholson and Phillips, 1981)
operating on the diffusion curve in the program VOLTORO
(kindly provided by C. Nicholson).
Prior to tissue measurements, diffusion curves were
recorded in 0.3% agar gel (Difco, Detroit, MI) dissolved in a
solution of 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, and 1 mM TMAþ
chloride. In diluted agar, a and k are by deﬁnition set to 1,
and k0 is set to 0; the electrode transport number (n) and the
free TMAþ diffusion coefﬁcient (D) are extracted by curve
ﬁtting (Nicholson and Phillips, 1981).
Solutions
Solutions were prepared according to the compositions
given in Table I from 103 concentrated stock solutions. Glu-
cose and mannitol were added to the solutions on the day of
the experiment. All solutions were equilibrated with 95% O2/
5% CO2 at least 1 hr before use. In some of the solutions, the
osmolarity was reduced by omitting 50 mM NaCl to simulate
in the immature hippocampus the smaller ECS volume re-
ported in mature nervous systems (Sykova et al., 2000). To
obtain identical Naþ and Cl– concentrations as well as ionic
strengths in solutions with different osmolarities, the osmolar-
ity in these solutions was adjusted by the addition of mannitol
(see Table I for details). The osmolarities of the solutions were
measured with a freezing-point depression osmometer (Kna-
uer, Berlin, Germany) and are given in Table I. Mannitol, 4-
AP, and TMAþ chloride were purchased from Sigma (Tauf-
kirchen, Germany) and all other substances from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany).
RESULTS
Diffusion Parameters of the Extracellular Space in
Immature Hippocampus
Diffusion parameters of the extracellular space in the
stratum radiatum of the immature hippocampal CA3
region were determined by means of the real-time ionto-
phoretic method (Nicholson and Phillips, 1981), and gave
absolute values for the extracellular space volume fraction
a, tortuosity factor k, and nonspeciﬁc uptake k0 (Fig. 1B).
In hippocampal slices from P5 rats, the extracellular vol-
ume fraction a had a mean value of 0.41 6 0.01 (n ¼
10). This value is about twice as large as in adult hippo-
campus (McBain et al., 1990; Perez-Pinzon et al., 1995;
Mazel et al., 1998). Diffusion in the adult rat hippocam-
pus in vivo has been shown to be anisotropic, i.e., differ-
ent along the three orthogonal axes (Mazel et al., 1998).
In hippocampal slices from P5 animals, the tortuosity
along the mediolateral (x) axis (1.39 6 0.01, n ¼ 10) did
not signiﬁcantly differ from the tortuosity along the ros-
trocaudal (y) axis (1.38 6 0.03, n ¼ 10), indicating iso-
tropic diffusion in the CA3 region of the immature hip-
pocampus. Nonspeciﬁc uptake k0 was 8.32 6 0.6 3 10–3
sec–1 (n ¼ 10).
A Combination of Excitatory Stimuli
Is Necessary To Evoke Epileptiform Activity
Spontaneous epileptiform activity was only rarely
observed in P4–7 rat hippocampal slices with standard
epilepsy models. No epileptiform activity was induced by
the addition of 10 lM 4-AP to standard ACSF (n ¼ 8).
In standard low-Mg2þ solution, only three of 52 slices
showed epileptiform activity consisting of ictal-like events.
However, the combined application of 10 lM 4-AP in
standard low-Mg2þ solution was sufﬁcient to induce epi-
leptiform activity in 73% of all slices (n ¼ 41). The epilep-
tiform activity started in most cases with ictal-like events.
Such ictal-like events lasted for more than 20 sec and
began with an initial high-frequency burst of spikes, which
was in most cases followed by several separate groups of
discharges (Fig. 2A). In some cases (two of 30 slices), the
epileptiform activity transformed into a repetitive discharge
pattern, described as late recurrent discharges (LRD;
Zhang et al., 1995). Each single LRD lasted for less than
5 sec and consisted of only a few spikes (Fig. 2A). The
incidence rate for epileptiform activity increased with
higher 4-AP concentrations, whereas a reduction of the
4-AP concentration to 5 lM decreased the incidence rate
(Fig. 2B). Increasing 4-AP concentrations also changed
the pattern of epileptiform activity from a predominantly
ictal-like pattern at low 4-AP concentrations (5–10 lM)
to a mostly LRD pattern at higher 4-AP concentrations
(50–100 lM; Fig. 2C). In addition, the frequency of LRD
signiﬁcantly increased with higher 4-AP concentrations
(Fig. 2D). In summary, these results demonstrate that the
application of low 4-AP doses in low-Mg2þ solution is re-
quired to evoke epileptiform-like activity reliably in im-
mature rat hippocampal slices. The dose dependence of the
4-AP effects suggests that a promotion of LRD-like activ-
ity and an increase in the frequency of epileptiform
discharges indicate an enhanced excitation within hippo-
campal slices.
Effect of Osmolarity on Epileptiform Activity
We further investigated the effect of hypo- and
hyperosmolar conditions on the expression of epilepti-
form activity induced by the application of 10–50 lM 4-
AP in low-Mg2þ solution. For all of the following experi-
ments, the NaCl concentration of the ACSF was reduced
to maintain identical Naþ and Cl– concentrations in
hypo-, normo-, and hyperosmolar solutions (see Table I).
The change from ACSF to normoosmolar solution
affected the epileptiform activity observed in 4-AP solu-
tions containing low Mg2þ. It increased the amplitude of
the epileptiform discharges by 56.4% 6 19.4% (n ¼ 9)
but had no signiﬁcant effect on LRD frequency (99.8% 6
5.2%, n ¼ 9). Long-duration recordings revealed that the
frequency of the LRD increased slightly, by 8.6% 6 5.2%
(n ¼ 12), during a recording interval of 3 hr.
A change from normoosmolar to hypoosmolar solu-
tion increased the frequency of LRD. A hypoosmolar
shift of –90 mOsm led to a signiﬁcant (P < 0.01, paired t-
test) increase in LRD frequency from 0.20 6 0.013 to
122 Kilb et al.
Journal of Neuroscience Research DOI 10.1002/jnr
0.26 6 0.011 Hz (n ¼ 16), corresponding to an increase
of 39.9% 6 8.1% (Fig. 3A–D), whereas the discharge am-
plitude increased by 28.9% 6 8.0% (Fig. 3E). A reduction
in osmolarity of 40 mOsm led to a smaller but still signiﬁ-
cant (P < 0.01) increase in LRD frequency by 24.1% 6
4.8% (n ¼ 10), whereas the amplitude increased by
13.1% 6 2.8%. In contrast to these enhancing effects of
hypoosmolar solutions, hyperosmolar solutions attenuated
epileptiform activity (Fig. 3D,E). An increase in the osmo-
larity of 45 mOsm signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) reduced the
frequency of LRD by 13.1% 6 3.1% (n ¼ 11), whereas
the þ100 mOsm hyperosmolar solution diminished LRD
frequency by 15.5% 6 3.5% (n ¼ 12; P < 0.05). Neither
solution had a signiﬁcant effect on discharge amplitude
(95.3% 6 5.5% and 88.2% 6 8.0%, respectively).
Effect of Osmolarity on Susceptibility
to Epileptiform Discharges
The previous experiments demonstrated that a de-
crease in osmolarity of –90 mOsm enhances the epilepti-
form activity in the immature hippocampus. The perfu-
sion with this hypoosmolar solution evoked cell swelling
and a compensatory ECS volume fraction decrease to
0.17 6 0.02 (n ¼ 4), whereas tortuosity increased to 1.49
6 0.03 (Fig. 1C). Thus, this decrease in osmolarity of
90 mOsm reduces the extracellular volume fraction by
50–55%, i.e., to values similar to those observed in the
adult hippocampus (Hrabetova, 2005; McBain et al.,
1990; Perez-Pinzon et al., 1995). Therefore, we exam-
ined whether the immature hippocampus shows a greater

susceptibility to epileptiform discharges under hypoosmo-
lar conditions. The application of Mg2þ-containing hypo-
osmolar solution (–90 mOsm, 1 mM Mg2þ) failed to
induce epileptiform discharges (n ¼ 7), demonstrating
that these hypoosmolar conditions alone are not sufﬁcient
to evoke epileptiform activity. Normoosmolar low-Mg2þ
solution also failed to induced epileptiform-like activity in
16 hippocampal slices, which is in accordance with our
results with standard low-Mg2þ solution. Moderately
hypoosmolar (–45 mOsm) low-Mg2þ solution induced
epileptiform-like activity in only two of 15 hippocampal
slices. Reducing the osmolarity of low-Mg2þ solution by
–90 mOsm induced epileptiform activity in a signiﬁcantly
larger fraction (9/19; P < 0.05, Fisher exact test) of the
slices (Fig. 4). In conclusion, these results demonstrate
that hypoosmolar solutions increase the susceptibility to
epileptiform discharges in immature hippocampal slices.
DISCUSSION
The main ﬁndings of the present study can be sum-
marized as follows. 1) The CA3 region of the P4–7 rat
hippocampus is characterized by a large extracellular space
that lacks diffusion anisotropy. 2) Hypoosmolar extracel-
lular solution (–90 mOsm) reduces a to values compara-
ble to values in the adult hippocampus. 3) Hypoosmolar
extracellular conditions increase the frequency of epi-
leptiform discharges, whereas hyperosmolar solutions re-
duce the frequency of epileptiform discharges. 4) Hypoos-
molar extracellular solution enhances the susceptibility to
epileptiform activity. In summary, these results demon-
strate that osmolarity affects the excitability in the imma-
ture hippocampus and suggest that the larger extracellular
space contributes to the suppression of excitability in
immature nervous systems.
Properties of the Extracellular Space
in Immature Hippocampus
For immature hippocampal slices, we determined an
ECS volume fraction, a, of 0.41, a value about twice as
large as that in adult hippocampus in vivo (0.2–0.22;
Mazel et al., 1998) or in adult hippocampal slices (0.18–
0.24; McBain et al., 1990; Perez-Pinzon et al., 1995; Hra-
betova, 2005). Because comparable values for a have
been obtained under in vivo, interface, and submerged re-
cording conditions in adult hippocampus (McBain et al.,
1990; Perez-Pinzon et al., 1995; Hrabetova, 2005), the
larger a estimated in the present study under submerged
conditions is presumably also valid for the investigations
of epileptiform activity performed under interface condi-
tions. Our ﬁnding is comparable to observations in other
brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, corpus cal-
losum, or spinal cord gray and white matter, where a
larger extracellular space has been consistently observed
during early developmental stages (Lehmenkuhler et al.,
1993; Prokopova et al., 1997). The larger ECS in the
immature brain can be explained by the relatively low
density of neuronal and glial cells and allows the easier
diffusion of growth factors and extracellular signaling
molecules required for various maturation processes
(Sykova, 2004). However, a large ECS will attenuate the
concentrations of neuroactive substances, such as Kþ ions
or glutamate, that are released during neuronal activity
and may also decrease ephaptic interactions between ex-
citable structures (Traynelis and Dingledine, 1989; Fox
et al., 2004), thereby decreasing seizure susceptibility in
the immature hippocampus. This attenuation of Kþ and
glutamate transients in the larger ECS is probably of spe-
cial relevance, because as the delayed maturation of astro-
cytes in immature rodent hippocampus will reduce the
capacity of glial cells to control the extracellular environ-
ment (Bushong et al., 2004). A reduction in the osmolar-
ity of –90 mOsm reduced a to 0.17 and thus to values
comparable to values in the adult hippocampus (McBain
et al., 1990; Perez-Pinzon et al., 1995; Mazel et al.,
1998). A comparable reduction has been demonstrated in
spinal cord slices, where a decline in osmolarity by 100
mOsm evoked a decrease in a of 30–40%, to values of
0.15–0.16 (Vargova et al., 2001; Sykova et al., 2003).
The adult hippocampus in vivo displays a profound
diffusion anisotropy (Mazel et al., 1998), although
recently isotropic diffusion in the CA1 stratum radiatum
in adult hippocampal slices has been described (Hrabe-
tova, 2005). For the immature hippocampus, we found
similar tortuosity values (k) along the mediolateral and
rostrocaudal axes, suggesting a lack of diffusion anisotropy
during early development that may be due to incomplete
gliogenesis and a different amount or composition of the
extracellular matrix. The diffusion anisotropy described
for the mature hippocampus may facilitate and direct in-
formation ﬂow via extracellular volume transmission in
this tissue (Mazel et al., 1998; Sykova et al., 2000). An
important physiological role of changes in a and diffusion
anisotropy has been demonstrated in the supraoptic nu-
cleus of adult rats (Piet et al., 2004), where during lacta-
tion the relatively high values of a decrease to values sim-
ilar to those in the adult cortex, the tortuosity decreases,
and diffusion anisotropy disappears. These changes during
lactation in fact facilitate the diffusion of neurotransmitters

synaptic cross-talk, and enhance the release of hormones
(Piet et al., 2004).
Properties of Epileptiform Activity
in Immature Hippocampus
In the present study, epileptiform activity was only
rarely observed in P4–7 rat hippocampal slices with stand-
ard epilepsy models. Bath application of 10 lM 4-AP
failed to evoke epileptiform activity, although a higher
concentration of 4-AP (50 lM) is sufﬁcient to trigger epi-
leptiform activity in the CA3 region of P2–7 hippocam-
pus (Psarropoulou and Avoli, 1996). In the present study
only a small fraction of slices showed epileptiform activity
in low-Mg2þ solution, but in a previous study epilepti-
form activity could be evoked in the majority of slices
from P5–8 hippocampus under low-Mg2þ conditions
(Sabau et al., 1999). The higher temperature of 358C and
elevated Kþ concentration of 3 mM used in the latter
study might have caused this discrepancy. In intact hippo-
campal preparations, epileptiform-like activity can be reli-
ably induced merely by 4-AP and low-Mg2þ (Luhmann
et al., 2000a; Quilichini et al., 2002), suggesting that the
reduced synaptic networks in slice preparations contribute
to a decreased susceptibility to epileptiform discharges.
The membrane and synaptic properties of immature neu-
rons, such as longer membrane time constants, more
depolarized action potential thresholds, rapid fatigue of
synaptic responses, and less well developed synaptic con-
nections, also contribute to the lower susceptibility to epi-
leptiform discharges observed in the immature hippocam-
pus (Kriegstein et al., 1987; Avanzini et al., 1992; Luh-
mann et al., 2000b).
However, the application of 4-AP in low-Mg2þ so-
lution reliably evokes epileptiform discharges in the
immature hippocampus. Our experiments revealed that
an increase in the 4-AP concentration and thus in the
excitatory drive on hippocampal neurons improved the
incidence rate of epileptiform events, changed the pattern
of epileptiform activity from predominantly ILE to LRD,
and augmented the frequency of LRD. We therefore pro-

pose that an increased incidence rate of epileptiform-like
discharges, an increased abundance of LRD, or an
increased LRD frequency indicates an enhanced excita-
tory drive toward the hippocampal neurons. However,
these ﬁndings do not imply that an increase in these pa-
rameters can be correlated with the severity of seizures in
human patients.
Hypoosmolar Solutions Promote
Epileptiform Activity
Our experiments demonstrate that frequency of LRD
depends on the osmolarity of the solution. Although hy-
poosmolar solution increases LRD frequency, it was di-
minished under hyperosmolar conditions. These sudden
and reversible effects are clearly different from the slow
increase of LRD frequency observed in the control ex-
periments. Strong hypoosmolar solutions, which reduce a
to values resembling the adult ones, also increase the inci-
dence rate for epileptiform discharges. Given the effect of
increasing 4-AP concentrations on the incidence rate and
the frequency of LRD, these ﬁndings suggest an enhanced
excitatory drive in hippocampal networks under hypoos-
molar conditions.
It has been previously demonstrated that hypoosmo-
lar conditions increase epileptiform activity also in adult
hippocampal slices (Traynelis and Dingledine, 1989;
Andrew et al., 1989; Saly and Andrew, 1993; Azouz
et al., 1997; Baraban and Schwartzkroin, 1998). Detailed
analysis revealed that an effect of hypoosmolar conditions
on cellular and synaptic properties of mature hippocampal
neurons occurs in a cell type-speciﬁc manner, which can
also not be excluded for immature hippocampal neurons.
For example, hypoosmolar conditions potentiate voltage-
activated Kþ currents in some interneurons and in mossy
cells but not in pyramidal neurons (Baraban et al., 1997;
Baraban and Schwartzkroin, 1998). Synaptic ﬁeld poten-
tials are not affected by a slightly hyperosmolar solution
(–40 mOsm) in CA3 (Saly and Andrew, 1993), although
they are enhanced in CA1, even when corresponding
changes in tissue resistance were taken into account (Che-
babo et al., 1995). In CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons,
hypoosmolar conditions change the properties toward a
burst ﬁring pattern (Saly and Andrew, 1993; Azouz et al.,
1997), which may promote the induction of epileptiform
activity (Jensen et al., 1994). In addition to these cellular
effects, the decrease in the extracellular volume fraction a
under hypoosmotic conditions will narrow extracellular
clefts, which will enhance extracellular Kþ accumulation
or neurotransmitter transients (Traynelis and Dingledine,
1989; Sykova et al., 2000). Finally, a direct inﬂuence of
electrical ﬁelds via ephaptic effects resulting from the
increased tissue resistance under this condition might also
contribute to increased neuronal synchronization (Fox
et al., 2004). Alterations in the tissue resistance caused by
a contraction of the ECS may also account for the
changes in the amplitude of epileptiform discharges
observed under hypoosmolar conditions (Andrew et al.,
1989).
The present study also demonstrates that, under
strong hypoosmolar conditions, epileptiform activity could
be induced in the immature hippocampus by the low-
Mg2þ model. This result implies that the susceptibility to
epileptiform discharges was signiﬁcantly increased in –90-
mOsm solutions, i.e., under conditions that reduce the
extracellular space to absolute values similar to those
found in the mature hippocampus. Under these condi-
tions, a may be too small to suppress epileptogenesis under
low-Mg2þ conditions. However, altered membrane prop-
erties of immature hippocampal neurons resulting from
the hypoosmolar solution might also contribute to this
effect.
In summary, our results suggest that the larger a in
the immature hippocampus suppresses neuronal excitabil-
ity of the immature hippocampus. However, strong
hypoosmolar conditions are required to enhance the sus-
ceptibility to epileptiform discharges, whereas, in the
adult hippocampus, more moderate alterations in osmo-
larity affect epileptiform activity (Andrew et al, 1989;
Haglund and Hochman, 2005). The wide ECS in imma-
ture hippocampus may thus serve as a relatively constant
parameter reducing the excitability in this tissue, whereas,
in the mature hippocampus, physiological and pathophys-
iological states dynamically change the relatively narrow
extracellular space, thereby strongly inﬂuencing neuronal
excitability (Schwartzkroin et al., 1998; Sykova and
Chvatal, 2000).
The developmental status of P4–7 rat pups corre-
sponds to that of prenatal human fetuses (gestational week
24–28), not to that of newborn infants (Bayer et al.,
1995). Thus, the results of the present study cannot be
transferred directly to human infants, in particular because
no information about the size of the ECS in human
infants is available. In addition, the effective osmolarity
changes used in the recent study are larger than the osmo-
larity changes of the cerebrospinal ﬂuid expected during
pathophysiological conditions (DiMattio et al., 1975;
Andrew, 1991). On the other hand, the extracellular
space is substantially reduced during an epileptic seizure
(Heinemann, 1986), caused mainly by an increase in the
intracellular osmolarity mediated by spatial Kþ buffering
and enhanced metabolic activity (Lux et al., 1986), sug-
gesting that, also during a seizure, a larger ECS affects epi-
leptiform activity. Changes in the ECS might thus also be
considered to have causal (Keating et al., 1991) and thera-
peutic aspects in childhood epilepsies, in addition to other
epileptogenic mechanisms. Recent clinical studies have
revealed that the osmolyte mannitol can reduce epileptic
seizures in humans (Haglund and Hochman, 2005). Thus,
interfering with the osmolarity of the extracellular volume
compartment might possibly offer a therapeutic concept
for childhood epilepsies, in which classical pharmacologi-
cal treatment often fails (Dulac et al., 1995).
