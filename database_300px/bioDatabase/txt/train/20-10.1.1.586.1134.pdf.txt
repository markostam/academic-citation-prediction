Abstract
The transcription factor GATA-3 is required for normal
mammary gland development, and its expression is highly
correlated with estrogen receptor A (ERA) in human breast
tumors. However, the functional role of GATA-3 in ERA-
positive breast cancers is yet to be established. Here, we show
that GATA-3 is required for estradiol stimulation of cell cycle
progression in breast cancer cells. The role of GATA-3 in
estradiol signaling requires the direct positive regulation of
the expression of the ERa gene itself by GATA-3. GATA-3 binds
to two cis-regulatory elements located within the ERa gene,
and this is required for RNA polymerase II recruitment to ERa
promoters. Reciprocally, ERA directly stimulates the tran-
scription of the GATA-3 gene, indicating that these two factors
are involved in a positive cross-regulatory loop. Moreover,
GATA-3 and ERA regulate their own expression in breast
cancer cells. Hence, this transcriptional coregulatory mecha-
nism accounts for the robust coexpression of GATA-3 and ERA
in human breast cancers. In addition, these results highlight
the crucial role of GATA-3 for the response of ERA-positive
breast cancers to estradiol. Moreover, they identify GATA-3 as
a critical component of the master cell-type–specific tran-
scriptional network including ERA and FoxA1 that dictates
the phenotype of hormone-dependent breast cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women
worldwide (1). The growth of over two-thirds of breast tumors is
stimulated by estrogen through the activation of the estrogen
receptor a (ERa), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily
and the master regulator of the behavior of these tumors (2, 3).
ERa-positive breast tumors are characterized by a gene expression
profile exhibiting profound differences with that of ERa-negative
tumors. One of the genes whose expression is the most highly
correlated with that of ERa in breast cancer encodes the
transcription factor GATA-3 (4–9).
GATA-3 belongs to a family of six transcription factors, GATA-1
to GATA-6, each of which binds to the DNA consensus sequence
(A/T)GATA(A/G) via two zinc-finger motifs (10, 11). GATA-3 is a
master regulator of immune cell function through its requirement
for the differentiation of T helper cells (12, 13). The GATA-3 knock-
out mouse has significant developmental abnormalities and is
embryonically lethal (14, 15). Recently, conditional knock-out of
GATA-3 revealed a crucial role for this factor at multiple stages of
mammary gland development, including the formation of terminal
end buds at puberty and luminal cell differentiation (16, 17). This is
reminiscent to the phenotype of ERa knock-out mice (18). These
observations could explain why GATA-3 and ERa-positive breast
tumors tend to be morphologically more differentiated and less
aggressive than hormone-independent tumors (19–21).
Although the expression of GATA-3 is a hallmark of ERa-positive
tumors, its role in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. Here,
we show that GATA-3 is required for estradiol-mediated stimula-
tion of ERa-positive breast cancer cell (BCC) growth. We further
show that GATA-3 is involved in a cross-regulatory feedback loop
with ERa itself. This circuitry is therefore probably responsible for
the interdependent expression of these two factors in breast
tumors. These data establish a crucial role for GATA-3 in
maintaining ERa expression and sensitivity to the growth-
stimulatory effect of estrogen in breast cancer.
Materials and Methods
RNA interference. To reduce GATA-3 expression, we used small
interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide duplexes that were custom made
and synthesized by Dharmacon. The target sequences used were siGATA-3
no. 1, 5¶-AAGCCUAAACGCGAUGGAUAU-3¶ and siGATA-3 no. 2, 5¶-AACAUC-
GACGGUCAAGGCAAC-3¶. The sequence for targeting luciferase (siLuc) as a
nonspecific control was 5¶-AACACUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA-3¶.
Cell culture and transfection. MCF-7 and T47D cells were maintained
in DMEM (Cellgro), with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Inc.),
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 5 Ag/mL insulin (Sigma) and 100 units/mL
penicillin-streptomycin. The day before transfection with LipofectAMINE
2000 (Invitrogen), 3.5  105 MCF-7 cells or 2.8  105 T47D were grown in
six-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM (Cellgro) supplemented with 5%
charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Inc.) and
2 mmol/L L-glutamine. MCF-7 or T47D cells were transfected with 60 nmol/L
each siRNA duplex using 4.5 or 10 AL transfection reagent, respectively, in
2.5 mL Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 4 h before resuspension in fresh seeding
medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated as indicated
and used in subsequent analyses.
Immunoblot analysis. Whole cell extracts were prepared from MCF-7,
T47D cells 48 h after transfection with siRNA duplexes, and Western blot
assays were done as previously described (22). Immunoblotting was done
with polyclonal antibodies against GATA-3 (1:500; BioLegend), calnexin
(1:10,000; Stressgen Biotechnologies) or a monoclonal ERa antibody (1:125;
Ab-15, Lab Vision Corp.). Incubation with primary antibody was followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit

Detection was carried out using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate followed by scanning using a Fluorchem
5500 chemiluminescence imager (Alpha Innotech Corp.).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. T47D cells, 5.2  106, were
seeded in 150-mm plates in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5%
charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine for
3 days. For siRNA experiments, 2  106 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates,
transfected with 60 nmol/L siRNA oligonucleotide duplex and 60 AL
LipofectAMINE2000 the following day, and then cultured for 2 more days.
Cells were then treated with ethanol or 10 nmol/L 17h-estradiol for 45 min,
and ChIP assays were done as in ref. 23. We used antibodies to GATA-3
(Santa Cruz); ERa Ab-10 (Lab Vision) and ERa HC-20 (Santa Cruz); p300
(Santa Cruz); PolII (Santa Cruz); and H4K12ac (Upstate Biotechnology,
07-595). Purified DNA was used in real-time PCR analysis. Immunopreci-
pitated DNA amounts were normalized to inputs and expressed as
enrichment relative to internal negative controls used to define the
background of the experiments (23, 24). See Supplementary Table S1 for
primers used in ChIP analysis.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from
transfected MCF-7 or T47D cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), with
on-column DNase treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Real-
time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done as in ref. 22. See
Supplementary Table S1 for a list of primers used in this study.
Cell cycle analysis and growth assays. For cell cycle entry analysis,
transfected MCF-7 or T47D cells were treated with ethanol or 10 nmol/L
estradiol for 24 h and analyzed by propidium iodide staining and flow
cytometry as described (22). Growth assays were done and analyzed as in
ref. 23.
Data analysis. Data analyses were done using the Prism software.
Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t test comparison
for unpaired data and was indicated as follows: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.
Results
GATA-3 is required for estradiol stimulation of ERA-positive
BCC proliferation. To investigate the role of GATA-3 in ERa-
positive BCC, we first analyzed the consequences of its suppression
on the growth stimulatory effect of estradiol using the T47D cells
as a model (25). Expression of GATA-3 was efficiently reduced in
T47D cells by two different siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes at the
mRNA (data not shown) and protein levels (Fig. 1A). Upon
silencing of GATA-3, we observed that the estradiol-mediated
stimulation of T47D cell cycle progression was strongly reduced
(Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with and explain, at least in
part, the lower estradiol-mediated increase in T47D cell number
when GATA-3 was silenced (Supplementary Fig. S1). We found a
similar effect of GATA-3 silencing on estradiol-induced prolifera-
tion of MCF-7 cells, another model of ERa-positive BCC
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, these data point to a crucial
role of GATA-3 in the proliferative response to estradiol of ERa-
positive BCC.
GATA-3 controls estradiol signaling by regulating ERA
expression. ERa mediates estradiol signaling in BCC by inducing
the expression of various target genes, including stromal cell-
derived factor 1 (SDF-1), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-jun
(26–29). We observed that estradiol-mediated induction of these
target genes was reduced by GATA-3 silencing (Fig. 2A). Indeed,
the slight induction of c-jun was lost after GATA-3 silencing, and
the robust estradiol-mediated stimulation of SDF-1 and PR
expression was significantly blunted (Fig. 2A). These results
support the model that GATA-3 role in estradiol stimulation of
BCC proliferation is linked to its requirement for ERa target gene
activation. On the basis of this apparent general role for GATA-3
in estradiol signaling, we hypothesized that GATA-3 could in fact
positively regulate ERa expression itself in BCC. Therefore, we
monitored ERa mRNA expression in T47D cells after transfection
with the siRNA targeting GATA-3. We found that ERa mRNA
levels were strongly decreased upon GATA-3 silencing both in the
basal and hormone-treated conditions (Fig. 2A). Consequently,
ERa up-regulation after estradiol stimulation was not observed
when GATA-3 was silenced (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, we observed
that ERa protein expression levels were strongly reduced by
GATA-3 silencing (Fig. 2B). ERa expression was also diminished
when GATA-3 was silenced in the MCF-7 cell line (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S3A and B). Thus, GATA-3 is required for ERa
expression and subsequent ERa-mediated induction of estradiol
target genes that mediate the pro-proliferative signal of estradiol
in BCC.
GATA-3 recruitment to the ERa gene in BCC. The decrease
in ERa mRNA expression observed upon reduction of GATA-3
expression suggested that GATA-3 could regulate ERa at the
transcriptional level. To determine if GATA-3 directly regulated
ERa, we investigated whether GATA-3 was recruited to the ERa
gene using ChIP assays in T47D cells. The ERa gene comprises
at least six alternative promoters (named promoter A–F)
spanning >150 kb (Fig. 3A ; ref. 30). We analyzed GATA-3
recruitment to these various promoters as well as to two other
sites (hereafter called enhancer 1 and 2) within or in the vicinity
of the ERa gene (Fig. 3A). These regions corresponded to two
ERa recruitment sites identified from our recent genomewide
study of ERa binding sites in BCC (31). ERa binding to these
elements was validated by ChIP followed by real-time PCR
analysis of the immunoprecipitated DNA in T47D (Fig. 3B). ERa
recruitment to these sites was estradiol dependent, suggesting

Western blot for GATA-3 expression levels 2 d after transfection with siRNA
targeting GATA-3 or luciferase (Luc ) as a nonspecific control. B, T47D cells
were transfected as described in (A). Two days later, cells were treated with
10 nmol/L estradiol or ethanol vehicle for 24 h and harvested to analyze DNA
content by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. *, P < 0.05 versus

that these sites may be involved in the previously reported ERa
autoregulation (Fig. 2D ; refs. 32, 33). As shown in Fig. 3B , GATA-
3 was most highly enriched at enhancer 1 and slightly recruited
to enhancer 2, but not to the various ERa gene promoters. More
than a dozen other analyzed regions within the ERa gene with
potential GATA-3 target motifs in their vicinity did not show any
significant recruitment (data not shown). Recruitment of GATA-3
was observed in the absence of hormone at enhancer 1 and was
induced in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 3B). We found that the
transcriptional coactivator p300 was also highly enriched at
enhancer 1 and 2, particularly upon estradiol treatment (Fig. 3B).
Accordingly, histone H4K12 acetylation (H4K12ac), which can be
mediated by p300 (34), was also induced by estradiol over a
large region including these sites (Fig. 3B). The high basal levels
of H4K12 acetylation at promoter A could represent a mark of
activity stemming from initial steps of gene induction
and/or could be mediated by factors other than p300 (35–38).
A similar pattern was observed for acetylation of H3K18, another
mark typically associated with active chromatin regions (data
not shown; ref. 38).
GATA-3 is required for RNA polymerase II recruitment to
the ERa gene. To determine if the presence of GATA-3 at the
ERa gene was necessary for polymerase II (PolII) recruitment and
ERa gene transcription, we compared the association of PolII
with the ERa gene promoters in T47D cells that were transfected
with either siGATA-3 or a nonspecific siRNA. In the control cells,
PolII was primarily recruited to promoters A and F with a strong
induction by estradiol (Fig. 4A). When GATA-3 was silenced, PolII
recruitment at promoters A and F was reduced in the basal
conditions, and estradiol did not trigger a robust increase in
binding (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that GATA-3 could
regulate the activity of proximal and distal promoters of the ERa
gene. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated whether GATA-3
silencing could affect transcripts stemming from promoter A and
E + F activities using exon-specific primers (Fig. 4B). We found
that GATA-3 silencing reduced both promoter A and E + F
transcripts in the basal and estradiol-induced conditions (Fig. 4B)
in agreement with the PolII ChIP data. Therefore, GATA-3 is
required for the activity of proximal and distal ERa gene
promoters in BCC. GATA-3 binding to enhancer 1 and 2 likely
regulates ERa promoters through long-range enhancer-promoter
interactions (39, 40). On the other hand, we cannot exclude that
additional enhancer elements recruiting GATA-3 may exist within
the ERa gene.

GATA-3 and ERA reciprocally regulate GATA-3 gene
promoter activity. Our previous work on ERa binding to the
genome of BCC also identified an ERa recruitment site around
10 kb downstream of GATA-3 (Fig. 5A ; ref. 31). Like the enhancers
of the ERa gene, this site is highly evolutionary conserved
(Supplementary Fig. S4), a feature that supports the role for these
elements as transcriptional regulatory regions (41). As judged by
ChIP assays, ERa as well as p300 were recruited to this site
downstream of GATA-3 but not to its promoter upon estradiol
stimulation (Fig. 5B). Estradiol treatment also induced acetylation
of H4K12 at this site (data not shown). The GATA-3 transcrip-
tional start site is the closest one from this enhancer, and we
have already exemplified the role of downstream enhancers in
ERa-mediated gene regulation (23). Hence, we observed an up-
regulation of GATA-3 expression when T47D cells (Fig. 5C) and
MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5) were stimulated with
estradiol. Interestingly, we noticed that GATA-3 itself was also
recruited to the enhancer downstream of its own gene (Fig. 5D).
To analyze whether GATA-3 could regulate the activity of its own
gene, we monitored the effect of GATA-3 silencing on PolII
recruitment to the GATA-3 promoter (Fig. 5D). In the control cells
transfected with siLuc, PolII recruitment was slightly increased by
estradiol treatment in agreement with the previously observed
estradiol stimulation of GATA-3 mRNA expression. Interestingly,
GATA-3 silencing reduced PolII recruitment both in the absence
and presence of hormone, strongly suggesting that GATA-3
regulates its own gene activity (Fig. 5D).
Discussion
Thanks to recent studies analyzing the in vivo enhancer
activity of conserved noncoding sequences (41) as well as the
unbiased localization of DNase I hypersensitivity (42, 43) and
transcription factor recruitment sites (44), it is becoming
increasingly clear that numerous cis-regulatory elements are in
fact distant from the traditional proximal 1 kb promoter. Indeed,
distal enhancers can act as far as several hundreds of kilobases
away from the target genes through various potential mecha-
nisms including looping or linking (39). Often, these enhancers
are involved in cell-type–specific gene regulation (41, 23, 45). Our
previous genomewide identification of ERa binding sites revealed
that ERa is primarily recruited to distal enhancers rather than

to promoters of estradiol-modulated genes (31, 46). Hence, we
observed in this study the recruitment of ERa together with
GATA-3 to enhancers within or in the vicinity of their own genes
but not to their promoters. These sites exhibit histone marks
typical of active chromatin regions and recruit the coactivator
p300 upon estradiol stimulation. Interestingly, our large-scale
analysis of ERa binding sites within BCC revealed enrichment
for GATA recognition motifs within those sites (31), and
additional ChIP experiments indicated that GATA-3 was
recruited to 40% of 15 other tested ERa binding sites
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, in addition to their cross-
regulation studied in this paper, ERa and GATA-3 may share a
significant fraction of their cis-regulatory sites and downstream
target genes extending the role for GATA-3 in estrogen signaling
within BCC (Fig. 6).
In contrast to GATA-1 (47), no physical interaction was observed
between GATA-3 and ERa (Supplementary Fig. S7). Hence, GATA-3
and ERa may help recruit distinct sets of cofactors required for the
activity of the bound enhancers or may collaborate through
cooperative functions such as chromatin remodeling and multi-
protein complex assembly (48, 49).
Microarray expression data have clearly revealed a distinct gene
expression pattern between ERa-positive and negative breast
tumors (4–8). Among the genes whose expression most highly
correlates with that of ERa are a few other transcription factors
including FoxA1 and GATA-3 (9). Our recent work on FoxA1
revealed that this factor dictates ERa activity and led us to
propose that ERa belongs within a cell-type specific transcrip-
tional network in BCC (23, 46). Here, we extend this notion by
showing that GATA-3 and ERa are involved in a positive cross-
regulatory loop in BCC (Fig. 6). Interestingly, reciprocal regu-
lations were recently shown to be common between members of
the well-characterized hepatic transcriptional network (50).
Indeed, a positive cross-regulation between two genes most likely
ensures their stable coexpression (51). Thus, the high level of
coexpression between GATA-3 and ERa in human breast cancer
most probably relate to their transcriptional cross-regulation
observed within the BCC. Moreover, our data could help explain
why knock-out of GATA-3 or the GATA cofactor FOG2 was
accompanied by a concomitant loss in ERa expression in the
normal mouse mammary gland (17, 52). In addition to this cross-
regulation, GATA-3 and ERa seem to autoregulate their own

expression (Fig. 6). Because autoregulation seems to be used only
by a small fraction of key eukaryotic transcription factors, Odom
et al. have suggested that this mechanism could represent a
feature of master transcription factors within a given cell type or
cellular process (53). This would be in agreement with the crucial
role for GATA-3 (this study) and ERa (2, 3) in BCCs.
Altogether, our results provide a functional explanation for the
predominant coexpression of GATA-3 and ERa in breast cancer.

Figure 6. Proposed transcriptional
circuitry linking GATA-3 to ERa and
ultimately the biological response to
estradiol in BCC. GATA-3 and ERa are
involved in a positive cross-regulatory loop,
where each one of these factors is required
for the transcription of the other gene.
Moreover, GATA-3 and ERa autoregulate
their own expression. These mechanisms
could combine to maintain the high positive
correlation between GATA-3 and ERa
expression in BCC. Hence, by regulating
ERa levels (and also potentially through a
direct collaboration in the regulation of
downstream target genes) GATA-3 is
crucial for estradiol-stimulated progression
of ERa-positive BCC.

The link between ERa and GATA-3 may be part of the
transcriptional program involved in mammary epithelial cell
differentiation (16, 17), and coexpression of these factors likely
maintains the well-differentiated phenotype of the breast tumor
subtype that they characterize as well as its dependency on
estradiol for growth. Together with our previous works (23, 46),
these findings strongly support the existence of a transcriptional
network that specifies the ERa-positive phenotype of breast tumors
where ERa activity is linked to that of selectively coexpressed
transcription factors including FoxA1 and GATA-3.
