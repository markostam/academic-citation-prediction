ABSTRACT
Retroelements are usually considered to be eukary-
otic elements because of the large number and vari-
ety in eukaryotic genomes. By comparison, reverse
transcriptases (RTs) are rare in bacteria, with only
three characterized classes: retrons, group II introns
and diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs).
Here, we present the results of a bioinformatic
survey that aims to define the landscape of RTs
across eubacterial, archaeal and phage genomes.
We identify and categorize 1021 RTs, of which the
majority are group II introns (73%). Surprisingly, a
plethora of novel RTs are found that do not belong
to characterized classes. The RTs have 11 domain
architectures and are classified into 20 groupings
based on sequence similarity, phylogenetic ana-
lyses and open reading frame domain structures.
Interestingly, group II introns are the only bacterial
RTs to exhibit clear evidence for independent mobi-
lity, while five other groups have putative functions
in defense against phage infection or promotion of
phage infection. These examples suggest that addi-
tional beneficial functions will be discovered among
uncharacterized RTs. The study lays the ground-
work for experimental characterization of these
highly diverse sequences and has implications for
the evolution of retroelements.
INTRODUCTION
Reverse transcriptase (RT) was discovered in 1970 in
two tumor-associated retroviruses, and subsequently in a
variety of eukaryotic elements including long terminal
repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retroelements, hepadnaviruses
and telomerase (1–4). (In this article, we deﬁne a retroele-
ment as any element containing a putative RT, regardless
of its ability to retrotranspose.) Retroelements are abun-
dant in eukaryotic genomes, and often constitute large por-
tions of nuclear DNA, including 40% of the human
genome and 60% in maize (5,6). In general, eukaryotic
retroelements are thought to survive as selﬁshDNAs and to
have deleterious eﬀects on their hosts (7–9). It is not sur-
prising, however, given their prevalence that beneﬁcial
roles have occasionally evolved. For example, telomerase
and the HeT-A/TART retroelements function to protect
chromosomal ends (10–12). Still, such adaptations remain
the exception, and as a group the elements survive by
spreading faster than they are lost. Thus, retroelements
have expanded dramatically and are one of the major hall-
marks of eukaryotic genomes.
In bacteria, reverse transcriptase was discovered con-
siderably later, as a component of retrons (13,14).
Characterized bacterial retroelements have now grown
to three families, and include retrons, group II introns
and diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) (15–18).
In contrast to eukaryotic elements, bacterial retroelements
are not known to accumulate to high copy numbers within
a genome, with the greatest number being 28 group II
introns (1% of the genome) in the cyanobacterium
Thermosynechococcus elongatus (19). Bacterial retroele-
ments are also distinctive because they are structurally
simple. Group II introns and retrons encode a single poly-
peptide, while some viral retroelements encode over a
dozen polypeptides (20).
Group II introns are the best-characterized bacterial ret-
roelements and the only type known to exhibit autonomous
mobility. These retroelements consist of an RT encoded
within a catalytic, self-splicing RNA structure. RT
domains 1–7 constitute the palm and ﬁnger domains of
the polymerase protein, and their sequences are generally
alignable across RTs (21). In contrast, domains 0 and 2a
are shared among only a subset of RT classes (22,23).
Downstream of the RT domain is domain X, which corre-
sponds to the thumb of the polymerase, and has a second
function in facilitating splicing of its host intron (maturase
activity) (24,25). Many group II open reading frames
(ORFs) encode an endonuclease domain of the HNH
family that is important for the mobility mechanism (26).
Intronmobility is mediated by an ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
consisting of intron lariat and two molecules of intron-
encoded protein, which site-speciﬁcally recognizes and
inserts intron sequence into a 20- to 35-bp DNA target
(17). The mechanism, known as target-primed reverse

transcription (TPRT), is well characterized and there are
several variations (27,28).
The second type of bacterial RT, DGRs, does not
appear to be mobile, but instead functions to diversify
DNA sequences (18). For the phage BPP-1 of Bordetella
pertussis, the retroelement consists of the RT, an RNA
template (TR), an accessory protein (atd) and a target
protein gene (mtd) that contains a C-terminal variable
region (VR) (29). The role of the DGR is to produce
diversity in the VR sequence of the phage tail protein,
which is the region that contacts the bacterium during
infection. In doing so, the DGR mediates tropism
switching and allows the phage to infect cells with altered
surface composition, as occurs when Bordetella cells alter-
nate between pathogenic and free-living phases. RTs of
DGRs appear to be more closely related to group II
introns than retrons (30,31; our unpublished data).
Retrons, although discovered ﬁrst, are the most unex-
plained of bacterial retroelements. They do not appear to
be independently mobile, nor has a clear phenotype been
associated with them. Retrons consist of an RT and over-
lapping multicopy single-stranded DNA/RNA (msRNA/
msDNA) genes. The RNA transcript of the msRNA/
msDNA sequence folds into a speciﬁc secondary structure
to which the RT binds (32). The RT partially reverse tran-
scribes the RNA to form a branched RNA–DNA mole-
cule linked by a 20–50 bond. This msDNA accumulates to
high levels in some cases, but it remains unknown what
purpose the msDNA serves, for either the retron or the
host cell (15,16,33).
An additional type of retroelement has been tentatively
identiﬁed, but is not well characterized. We refer to these
elements here as Abi (abortive phage infection) retroele-
ments. The bacterium Lactococcus lactis encodes over 20
genetic systems that defend against phage infection. Each
system blocks infection at one of many points in the phage
replication cycle (34). Two of these systems, abiA and abiK,
encode genes related to RT (35,36). Mutations within the
RT motifs of abiK block abortive infection in vivo (35);
however, AbiA and AbiK proteins have not been shown
biochemically to have RT activity. An analogous property
has been reported for orf570 of the P2-like phage P2-EC30,
which is associated with resistance to phage T5 (37).
In the course of identifying group II introns in bac-
terial genomes, we found a number of RTs that appeared
not to belong to group II introns, retrons or DGRs.
Consequently, we undertook a comprehensive search
and analysis of RTs in eubacteria, archaea, and phages
to examine whether novel RT classes exist, and to deter-
mine how many types there might be. An independent
study has previously identiﬁed eight novel lineages of
retroelements by analyzing gene neighborhoods of the
RTs (38). Here, we identify an additional 9 groupings
and 38 unclassiﬁed RTs and present a comprehensive
overview of RTs in bacteria.
METHODS
Compilation of the RT data set
RTs were identiﬁed in GenBank (July 2007) using
PSI-BLAST (39) with a set of 25 RT queries
(Supplementary Table S1). Fifteen of these RTs have
been previously identiﬁed in searches designed to ﬁnd
distant RT relatives of group II introns, retrons and
DGRs. For example, BLAST searches with AbiA and
AbiK sequences produced weak hits having RT sequence
motifs, and using these hits as queries in further cycles,
a collection of putative RT ORFs was acquired. In
PSI-BLAST, the ﬁrst iteration identiﬁes closely related
sequences by standard BLASTP, while subsequent
iterations construct a PSSM (position speciﬁc scoring
matrix) based on the results of the previous cycle, and
this sequence proﬁle is then used as a query to identify
more distant relatives. In practice, we ﬁnd that ORFs
acquired in the ﬁrst search are sometimes absent in sub-
sequent iterations, and that later iterations often result in
only a small number of new sequences and can result in
artifactual hits. Thus, we chose to use a large number
of queries and a relatively small number of iterations to
maximize the eﬃciency of the search. After each itera-
tion, sequences with an e-value of <0.005 were retained.
Iterations 2–4 recovered from 368 to 625 sequences, and
pooling the results of all four iterations resulted in
approximately 600–800 sequences. By using a variety of
queries for PSI-BLAST, it was found that all group II
intron queries resulted in highly similar RT sets (95%
identical). Importantly, ORFs recovered from each query
invariably included distantly related RTs (e.g. group II
RTs identiﬁed Abi RTs and vice versa), and there was
a large degree of overlap in the ORF collections regard-
less of the initial query. Equivalent searches were done
for eubacteria, archaea, and phages and proteins smaller
than 100 amino acids were discarded as probable frag-
ments or nonspeciﬁc hits. The ﬁnal collection of putative
RTs was 1049 sequences, which included 11 RTs added
during subsequent BLAST searches and analyses of
novel groups.
Classification of sequences
For practical purposes, the 1049 RTs were divided into 10
sets, and each set was aligned with 32 reference sequences
of group II introns, retrons, DGRs and Abi elements
using CLUSTAL W (40). The reference sequences were
chosen to represent the known phylogenetic breadth of
each RT group (Supplementary Table S2). Initial phylo-
genetic analyses were done using the NJ algorithm with
uncorrected distances as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10
(41). Sequences belonging to group II introns, retrons
and DGRs were inferred by identifying the smallest
monophyletic group including all reference sequences for
a particular type of RT element. These groups were then
aligned automatically, and reﬁned manually in Bioedit
v7.0.5.2 (42) in order to identify sequence hallmarks
unique for each group (domain X for group II introns,
regions X and Y for retrons, TR–VR repeats for
DGRs). Other groupings were determined based on the
identiﬁcation of nearest neighbors using local BLAST
and reciprocal BLAST, and examination for synapomor-
phies in the ORF regions outside the RT domains,
i.e. appended domains and other shared sequences. For
some RTs, additional phylogenetic analyses were done
7220 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 22
to conﬁrm monophyly of classes and/or relationships
to previously identiﬁed elements. This was done using
the maximum likelihood criterion with the RtREV
model (43) including an invariant sites parameter as imple-
mented in RAxML (44). For these analyses, 100 bootstrap
replicates were also completed. Due to limited number of
alignable characters, this could only be done for a subset
of the RTs. Speciﬁcally one tree was made for group II
introns and the group II-like classes (213 amino acids
with 112 RTs), a second tree of retrons (157 amino
acids with 96 retrons) and a third one of DGRs (data
not shown).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Compilation and classification of bacterial RT genes
RT ORFs in eubacteria, archaea and phages were identi-
ﬁed in GenBank using PSI-BLAST and a diverse set of 25
bacterial RT queries (see Methods section). The queries
included ORFs representing group II introns, retrons,
DGRs and Abi elements, as well as 15 RTs previously
identiﬁed as unlikely to belong to these classes (Supple-
mentary Table S1). For each query, four iterations of
PSI-BLAST were done and the hits from all four searches
were pooled. In preliminary searches, we found that this
search strategy (i.e. relatively few iterations with a large
number of queries) was the best method for retrieving
the most comprehensive and diverse set of sequences
(see Methods section for further details). The results of
the 25 searches were pooled into a single nonredundant
set for a total of 1049 putative RT ORFs (Supplementary
Data S1).
In order to test the thoroughness of this strategy,
we repeated the PSI-BLAST search at the end of the
study using three newly identiﬁed RTs (gi|124009057,
gi|91202364, gi|89895550) which are not closely related
to any initial queries. The purpose was to ﬁnd whether
‘outlier’ RTs would identify even more diverse RT
sequences. However, these queries primarily retrieved the
RTs found in the initial search, and no new groups were
discovered. For this reason, as well as the overall redun-
dancy of RTs found when using diﬀerent queries, we
believe that the search strategy approached saturation,
and that our data set reﬂects the composition of RTs
present in GenBank.
The collected RT sequences are highly diverse, with
fewer than 100 amino acids alignable across the set,
thus preventing robust phylogenetic analyses (below).
Nevertheless, neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were useful in
the initial steps of clustering related sequences and iden-
tifying the RTs of group II introns, retrons and DGRs.
NJ trees were constructed in batches of approximately
100 unknown ORFs along with 30 reference sequences
spanning the diversity of group II introns, retrons and
DGRs (Supplementary Table S2). ORFs were putatively
assigned to one of these classes based on the NJ trees,
and further alignments within each subset allowed con-
ﬁrmation and reﬁnement of the classiﬁcations based
on sequence hallmarks. Identiﬁcations of group II introns
were supported by the presence of a domain X motif (25),
and also by comparison with our highly curated intron
database [(45); www.fw.ucalgary.ca/group2introns/]. In
some cases, group II introns were conﬁrmed by generating
intron RNA secondary structures. In this way, 742 ORFs
were designated group II introns, although many are
duplicate copies or fragments (below). Similarly, 113
ORFs were assigned as retron RTs and were supported
by the sequence hallmarks X and Y (15). Thirty-six DGRs
were veriﬁed by identiﬁcation of potential TR–VR repeats
adjacent to the RT (29).
Classiﬁcation of Abi RTs is problematic because
the three elements reported to have abortive infection
properties (AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2) are distantly related,
with only three RT domains alignable between them
(Figure 1). One possibility is that Abi elements constitute
an extremely diverse but monophyletic lineage of RTs
involved in phage abortive infection. Alternatively, mul-
tiple lineages of RTs may have evolved roles in abortive
infection. In either case, one cannot conﬁdently conclude
which other RTs in the set might have abortive infection
properties. Hence, we assign only three close relatives
as belonging to the AbiK group and eight to the Abi-P2
group, while AbiA has no close relatives.
The remaining 146 ORFs were further analyzed by
manual alignment and BLASTP searches to conﬁrm that
they are bacterial RTs rather than nonspeciﬁc BLAST
hits. In total, 121 ORFs were alignable with RT motifs,
but three of these were discarded as eukaryotic RTs. In the
end, 80 RTs were assigned to 14 additional groups based
on reciprocal local BLAST best-hits, shared features
outside of the RT domains, and in some cases phyloge-
netic support (Figures 1 and 2). Thirty-eight RTs remain
unclassiﬁed because they form less convincing groups or
groups of two members.
Classes of RTs in bacteria
Group II introns. The largest category of RTs in bacteria is
the family of group II intron-encoded proteins, with 742
sequences. Of these, approximately 219 are full-length,
unique introns (www.fw.ucalgary.ca/group2introns/), and
the remaining are either truncated copies, multiple copies
within genomes or redundant GenBank entries. Even so,
they comprise the largest group of bacterial RTs. Based on
phylogenetic analyses of the RT, the introns fall into eight
classes (A, B, C, D, E, F,ML and CL) with each class being
associated with a distinct RNA secondary structure (45).
All of these classes are expected to possess the canonical
properties of group II introns, namely ribozyme-based
splicing and retromobility.
Group II intron-like RTs. A number of RTs initially
appeared to be group II introns, but no associated RNA
structures could be found. While it is not possible to
exclude the existence of an associated ribozyme, there is
no secondary structure motif similar to the highly con-
served catalytic domain 5 of known group II introns.
Hence, if these RTs are associated with introns, their ribo-
zyme structure would have to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from known group II introns, or their introns might be
encoded elsewhere in the genome.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 22 7221
A phylogenetic tree of the group II-like (G2L) RTs
along with a selection of group II intron RTs shows that
they fall into ﬁve classes (G2L1–G2L5) (Figure 2;
Supplementary Data S2). It is important to note that
G2L1 is paraphyletic; however, all members share a con-
served C-terminal extension and other genomic features
that suggest a similar function (below). A notable feature
of the G2L classes is the conservation of the maturase
(splicing) motif of domain X in three groups (G2L3,
G2L4 and G2L5) despite the apparent lack of an intron
RNA structure. In addition, G2L5 RTs have a conserved
sequence change at the active site of the protein in domain
5 (DD to DN), suggesting that the protein has lost
polymerase activity, and possibly has acquired another
activity in conjunction with its approximately 500 amino
acids N-terminal extension.
While RTs of G2L3-5 have few clues to suggest speciﬁc
properties, all RTs of G2L1 and G2L2 are associated
with CRISPR elements (Clustered Regularly Interspaced
Short Palindromic Repeats). CRISPR elements are a
recently identiﬁed type of genetic cassette and repetitive
array found widely across eubacteria and archaea (46,47).
The function of CRISPR elements is to provide resistance
against phage infections. After a CRISPR-containing
bacterium is infected by phage, resistant bacteria emerge
which have phage sequence integrated into the CRISPR
arrays, and the bacteria are resistant to future infections
by that phage (48). Resistance is believed to be mediated
Figure 1. RTs identiﬁed in eubacterial, archaeal and phage genomes. RTs were classiﬁed based on limited phylogenetic analyses, BLAST scores and
sequence examination for synapomorphies. The number of RTs per group is indicated in parentheses and by triangle size. Domain structures are
depicted in black (alignable with group II introns), gray (uncertain alignment) and white (lack of alignability). Additional domains, including
domains of unknown function (DUFs), are in light gray squares, with parentheses indicating that some members lack the domain. In this ﬁgure,
the designation of an extension as a DUF indicates that the amino acid sequence is conserved within the group. Groups corresponding to lineages in
Kojima and Kanehisa (38) are as follows: G2L1 [H1, H2, H3 in (38)]; G2L2, (H4); UG1 (F1); UG3 (G); UG5 (F2); UG6 (E); UG8 (G); UG9 (D);
retrons (A); and DGRs (B, C).

by an enzymatic complex composed of several proteins
and an RNA generated from the CRISPR array (46).
The mechanism for sequence integration into CRISPR
arrays remains unknown.
Essentially all CRISPR elements contain a CRISPR-
associated gene (cas1), which is a putative integrase and
contains the conserved domain COG1518. In G2L1
ORFs, the COG1518 domain is fused to the RT ORF as
approximately 400 amino acids C-terminal extension,
while for G2L2 RTs this domain is a free-standing ORF
located 31- to 501-bp downstream of the RT gene. It is
tempting to speculate that G2L1 and G2L2 RTs are
involved in the insertion of new phage sequences into
the CRISPR arrays using a mechanism analogous to
TPRT insertion of group II introns (49). However, only
a minority of CRISPR elements have an associated RT
gene (50), and so such a mechanism is unlikely to be gen-
eral. A ﬁnal note is that the paraphyletic nature of the
CRISPR-associated RTs (Figure 2) indicates that RTs
were independently acquired by CRISPR elements at
least twice. Consistent with this, the RT-associated
COG1518 domains are themselves not a monophyletic
lineage (50).
Retrons/Retron-like RTs. The retron group is the second
largest in bacteria with 113 members, of which 97 are
unique and 16 are highly similar sequences usually from
related strains. Members of this group share the retron-
speciﬁc regions X and Y (15). Region Y lies within RT
domain 7 and has been shown to be functionally impor-
tant for recognizing the msRNA structure for the priming
reaction (32). The role of region X, which lies between
domains 2 and 3, is less clear but also seems to be impor-
tant for the synthesis of msDNA. The retron/retron-like
group is highly diverse in sequence, making it diﬃcult
to ascertain whether all of its members have the same
properties as characterized retrons. We did not attempt
to identify potential msRNA/msDNA secondary struc-
tures as a means of veriﬁcation because we considered
the likelihood of false positives to be too great. Phyloge-
netic analysis of the RTs shows that characterized retrons
are found throughout much of the tree (Figure 3; Supple-
mentary Data S3). Moreover, RTs identiﬁed as retrons in
the literature without experimental veriﬁcation (15) are
even more widely distributed. Thus, it seems likely that
most RTs in this group are actual retrons. This set of
retron RTs is a signiﬁcant increase from approximately
30 that were previously reported (15).
DGRs. Our set of DGRs includes 36 RTs found in eight
phyla of bacteria and two bacteriophages. All of the
RT sequences are ﬂanked by potential TR–VR repeats,
consistent with known DGR features. These DGRs
are expected to possess equivalent diversity-generating
properties for their target VR sequence as shown for the
BPP-1 phage of B. pertussis (29). As previously noted (18),
at least some of the DGRs appear not to be phage-
associated, suggesting that the target genes are not
restricted to phage tail proteins.
Other RT groups. We identiﬁed three groups of Abi RTs
whose members are putatively involved in defense against
phage infections. The three groups are relatively small,

II-like (G2L) RTs. Group II introns include representatives of the
major intron classes [B–F, mitochondria-like (ML), chloroplast-like

support are shown with a gray circle and their previously assigned

having one, three and eight members, respectively for
AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2 groups. None of the three
groups have lengthy domains appended to the RT.
Shorter amino acid extensions can be found (less than
200 amino acids) which may encode additional functions,
but these sequences are not conserved across bacteria.
Nine classes of ‘unknown group’ RTs were deﬁned
(UG1-9) having 3–14 members each. Four of these
groups have C-terminal extensions ranging in length
from approximately 200–800 amino acids, which may
contribute novel biochemical activities (Figure 1). The
appended domains are conserved in sequence within
the groups with the exception of UG6. The C-terminal
domains are not highly similar to proteins of known
function, although the UG5 extension gives a very weak
match to a carbon–nitrogen hydrolase domain.
Thirty-eight RTs remained unclassiﬁed because they fell
into less convincing groupings or formed pairs of related
RTs. Ten of these RTs are obviously truncated, while
we predict that many of the remainder are functional
due to the absence of stop codons in their long ORFs.
Most unusual among these RTs are two single examples
(gi|118579436 and gi|42524098) with long extensions, of
which one (gi|42524098) has similarity to a primase at
the N-terminus (Figure 1). These two RT examples are
likely to possess novel activities or to be involved in
novel processes because of the very lengthy sequences
appended to the RT domains.
In Kojima and Kanehisa (38), eight novel RT groups
were identiﬁed in bacteria, based partially on fused and
ﬂanking genes. The RT groups identiﬁed here are consis-
tent with that study, although we identify an additional
nine groups (G2L3, 4, 5, UG2, 4, 7, AbiA, AbiK and
Abi-P2), and 38 unclassiﬁed ORFs [see Figure 1 legend
for correspondence with (38)]. Interestingly, Kojima and
Kanehisa (38) observed that RTs of UG3 and UG8 are
exclusively found in pairs, in a retroelement they call
Group G, and this observation holds true with the slightly
expanded number of RTs in our set. Another goal of that
study was to examine gene neighborhoods. The most
signiﬁcant observations were four RT lineages reported
to be ﬂanked by genes for DNA polymerase A, a primase
or a hydrolase. We examined the immediate ﬂanking
sequences (10 000 kb) of the new groups of RTs found
in our study, but did not ﬁnd any conserved ﬂanking genes
that would further characterize the retroelements.
Diversity of bacterial RTs
The set of compiled bacterial RTs is remarkably diverse,
with only 59 amino acids alignable across the entire set
(Figure 4). Table 1 presents data on sequence diversity
for each of the RT groups. The most valid measure may
be the average pairwise distance of the RTs within each
group, using only the 59 characters alignable across
all RTs. By that measure, the retron/retron-like group is
more diverse than group II introns (i.e. it has a greater
average pairwise distance), while DGRs have roughly
the same diversity. Seven other classes have equal or
greater pairwise distances compared to group II introns,
suggesting at least equal diversity despite fewer members
in the groups.
A limitation of this measurement is its reliance on a
small number of characters, all of which are likely to be
highly constrained. To increase the number of characters,
pairwise distances were determined based on all alignable
positions for RT domains 1–7 within each class (130–298
amino acids; column 5 in Table 1). These distances are
based on diﬀerent character sets for each group, but
nevertheless the same conclusion is suggested: retrons
are more diverse than group II introns, DGRs roughly
equal and seven other groups have at least as much diver-
sity as group II introns. A third measure is simply the
number of alignable characters within each class, across
RT domains 1–7. Consistent with the previous conclu-
sions, retrons have fewer alignable characters than group
II introns (157 versus 177), DGRs have about the same
number (179 versus 177) and ﬁve other groups have fewer
alignable characters (126–167 amino acids). Considering
these data together, it is clear that RTs in bacteria are
remarkably diverse in sequence, and they may be function-
ally diverse as well.
Interestingly, a comparison with eukaryotic RT
sequences suggests greater diversity among bacterial
RTs. This inference is drawn from the observation that
domains 1, 2 and 7 are unalignable for many bacterial
RTs, while obviously present in most eukaryotic RTs
(Figure 4). In addition, some bacterial RTs have extreme
amino acid substitutions. For example, in the Y/FxDD
motif of the catalytic site, the x is nearly always hydro-
phobic (A, I, V and M), whereas the bacterial group Abi-
P2 has a conserved R.
Mobility of the retroelements
It is striking that among this set, group II introns are the
only RTs with clear evidence of retromobility. Mobility
of the introns is indicated in sequence data by the many
redundant and truncated copies, and speciﬁcally by multi-
ple intron copies at diﬀerent locations in a single genome.
Furthermore, the exact boundaries of the mobile DNA
unit can be determined when identical introns are found
in diﬀerent exons. Among other RTs, the only other pos-
sible example of active retromobility is for UG4, where two
RTs (gi|151571385 and gi|151571856) are >90% identical
and are found within the same genome (Francisella tular-
ensis subsp. novicida GA99-3548). The ﬂanking sequences
are identical for 100 bp upstream of the RT ORFs,
but there is no discernable identity in their 30-ﬂanking
regions. This example is the only instance apart from
group II introns in which we ﬁnd closely related RTs
within the same genome. We looked for additional exam-
ples of potential mobility by comparing the genomic
locations of highly similar RTs found in closely related
organisms. In all cases, these RTs were found in identical
genomic locations. In addition, we found no lengthy con-
served target site duplications that could signify recent
mobility. The lack of evidence for independent mobility
of RTs (other than group II introns and UG4) suggests
either that they are not active for retromobility, or that
they transpose too infrequently to detect by these criteria.
7224 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 22
On the other hand, the RTs do not appear to be inher-
ited strictly vertically, as suggested from their patchy
distributions. For example, the retrons in our collection
are found in a large variety of species, but are on the whole
infrequent across bacteria. The distribution of retrons
within closely related strains has previously been shown
to be highly sporadic for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella,
Proteus and Salmonella (50,51), while there appears to
be a degree of vertical inheritance in myxobacteria (15).
The simplest explanation for this sporadic phylogenetic
distribution is RT-independent horizontal transfers,
which is also consistent with the ﬁnding of some
retrons within prophages (53). DGRs and other groups
of RTs similarly have wide and irregular distributions,
suggesting nonvertical inheritance (31). Kojima and
Kanehisa (38) made the same observation for UG1,
UG3/8, UG5, UG6 and UG9.
Functions of the retroelements
With the exception of G2L5, all groups in this study
possess three aspartate residues in motifs that putatively
correspond to the active site (Figure 4; Supplementary
Figure S1), which is consistent with having RT activity.
We consider it likely that all of these protein families fold
into a 3D structure similar to other RTs and have the
corresponding enzymatic activities. Although there are a
number of examples in which RT domains are unalignable
(Figures 1 and 4), in these cases there are suﬃcient
amino acids to correspond to the ‘missing’ domains,
Figure 4. Alignment of RT domains. An alignment of RT domains 0–7 is shown for representative bacterial and eukaryotic RTs. The predicted three
catalytic residues at the RT active site are indicated with asterisks. Residues judged to be alignable across all bacterial RTs (and used in distance
calculations for Table 1) are indicated with a plus sign at the bottom of the alignment. Absence of sequence in the ﬁgure indicates the lack of
alignability rather than the absence of amino acids. Sequences considered ambiguously aligned (based on a more comprehensive set of RTs than
those depicted in the ﬁgure) are indicated with light shading.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 22 7225
with the possible exception of domain 2a. Thus, the
absence of domains in Figures 1 and 4 signiﬁes that the
sequences cannot be aligned unambiguously, but does not
necessarily imply that the structural domains are absent
from the proteins.
In general, it is likely that an element with RT activity
will survive using one of two strategies (or a combination
of these). An RT may persist by helping the element pro-
pagate as a selﬁsh DNA, or alternatively by providing a
beneﬁt to the host organism. Group II introns are clearly
selﬁsh DNAs, because they do not have a discernable
host-related function and are mobile. In contrast, ﬁve
other groups of RTs appear to belong to the second
category and confer a useful function. Interestingly, all
of these functions pertain to either resistance to phage
infections [CRISPRs (G2L1, G2L2), AbiA, AbiK and
Abi-P2] or promotion of phage infections (DGRs). The
lack of evidence for active retrotransposition of other
uncharacterized RTs suggests that they have useful func-
tions, perhaps playing roles in phage–host or phage–phage
conﬂicts.
In considering possible roles of the RTs, it is nota-
ble that 11 diﬀerent extensions are fused to the RT
domains (Figure 1), suggesting that a variety of biochem-
ical activities are coupled to reverse transcription. These
domains include an endonuclease (group II introns), an
integrase (G2L1) and a primase (unclassiﬁed), while the
remainder have no predicted function. One diﬃculty in
predicting function based on sequence alone is illustrated
by CRISPR RTs, which are closely related to group II
intron RTs (particularly G2L2; Figure 2), yet are impli-
cated in a very diﬀerent biological process. This observa-
tion cautions against assuming shared properties for
related RTs, and greatly expands the plausible range of
activities and processes that might be carried out by the
collection of RTs.
Phylogenetic distribution of RTs
To address the phylogenetic distribution in eubacteria, we
considered the RT content of 519 completed genomes.
Approximately 25% of the genomes have at least one
RT, with 9% containing multiple RTs. These numbers
are lower estimates, as they are based on a set of nonre-
dundant RTs, such that very closely related RT copies
within a genome (i.e. group II introns and UG4) are
counted as a single RT. The RTs are widely distributed
across taxa, being found in nearly every eubacterial group
(11/14 as deﬁned by NCBI) (Figure 5; Supplementary
Table S3). Bacterial groups that lack an RT are also
underrepresented in GenBank, as indicated by the
number of completed genome sequences (Figure 5).
Similarly, the number of RTs in each group is roughly
proportional to the number of sequenced genomes,
although there are exceptions (compare bacteroidetes/
chlorobi group versus mollicutes) (Figure 5). We conclude
that RTs do not appear to be excluded from particular
bacterial groups or have extreme biases in their
distribution.
In contrast, RTs are far less frequent in archaea in our
data set. Archaeal RTs are mainly restricted to

euryarchaeota, and almost all are group II introns, except
for a single retron and two full-length unclassiﬁed RTs
from environmental samples, where the precise organismal
classiﬁcation is unclear (Figure 5; Supplementary
Table S2). Interestingly, the RTs found within archaea
do not constitute an independent lineage. If archaeal-spe-
ciﬁc lineages exist, it would seem that they must be too
divergent from known RTs to identify by our search strat-
egy, or are suﬃciently rare to be missed in our sample size.
Evolutionary implications
The large number of RT types in bacteria raises many new
possibilities for the origins of eukaryotic retroelements. It
is frequently hypothesized that eukaryotic RTs, and spe-
ciﬁcally non-LTR elements, are descended from group II
introns (54–56). This is based on the similar RT sequences
and mobility mechanisms of group II introns and non-
LTR retroelements, and also the general increase in com-
plexity of retroelements in eukaryotes. Also supporting
this idea is the fact that group II introns are present in
organelles, and could be introduced into nuclear chromo-
somes via the well-known process of endosymbiotic gene
transfer (57). Although there are now many more poten-
tial bacterial ancestors of non-LTR elements, we still con-
sider group II introns to be the most likely source, because
they are the only bacterial RTs that are clearly mobile.
An alternative to a single bacterial ancestor of eukar-
yotic RTs is multiple introductions of bacterial RTs into
eukaryotes. This possibility is made more plausible by the
ﬁndings in this study. However, due to high sequence
divergence, this issue cannot be resolved by phylogenet-
ics alone. A comparison of eukaryotic and prokaryotic
sequences in Figure 4 does not reveal to us clear evi-
dence between individual eukaryotic and prokaryotic
groups that would suggest a speciﬁc bacterial source for
a eukaryotic RT. Thus, the available sequence data appear
equally consistent with either a single or multiple event
introduction of RTs into eukaryotes.
Although reconstruction of global phylogenetic rela-
tionships is not possible, the data do suggest that group
II introns can readily form derivatives and acquire new
functions. This inference is based on the multiple lineages
of group II intron-related RTs, of which two have adapted
roles in phage defense (G2L1 and G2L2), one has appar-
ently lost RT activity (G2L5), and two have unknown
functions. While it is possible that one of these G2L
classes was ancestral to the cluster depicted in Figure 2
rather than group II introns, this seems less likely given
the increased opportunity that group II introns have
to form derivatives, due to their abundance, diversity
and mobility. The ability of group II introns to evolve
into new forms is consistent with the versatility expected
for the putative ancestors of spliceosomal introns.
CONCLUSIONS
Reverse transcriptases in bacteria appear to be fundamen-
tally diﬀerent from those in eukaryotes. They diﬀer dra-
matically in prevalence across species and in abundance
within genomes. Eukaryotic retroelements are found in
nearly every species, and often comprise a large propor-
tion of a genome. In contrast, most bacteria do not con-
tain a RT and when present they are far less abundant
within the genome (1%). This pattern mirrors that of
mobile DNA in bacteria in general. The lower content
of bacterial mobile elements is thought to reﬂect the
large population sizes with concomitant increase in eﬃ-
cacy of selection (58). Based on this logic, we predict
that a greater proportion of RTs in bacteria will be advan-
tageous to their hosts compared to eukaryotic elements, a
hypothesis consistent with data in this study.
Finally, it is clear that with currently accumulated
sequence data, we have not yet reached saturation with
regard to the number of bacterial RT groups. This con-
clusion is based on the number of RT types having only
one or a few representatives in the data set. It is virtually
assured that additional retroelement types are yet to be
discovered beyond the 20 groups and 11 architectures set
forth here. Based on the unique biochemical reactions
carried out by known bacterial retroelements (reverse
splicing into DNA, retrohoming, mutagenic homing and
msDNA synthesis) and their range of biological processes
(proliferation as selﬁsh DNA, tropism switching and
abortive phage infection), there is great potential for
additional novel properties to be found among the diver-
sity of RTs in bacteria.
