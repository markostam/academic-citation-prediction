ABSTRACT
For evolutionary comparisons, phylogenetics and
evaluation of potential interbreeding taxa of a
species, various loci have served for animals and
plants and protistans. One [second internal tran-
scribed spacer (ITS2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA]
is highly suitable for all. Its sequence is species
specific. It has already been used extensively and
very successfully for plants and some protistans,
and a few animals (where historically, the mitochon-
drial genes have dominated species studies).
Despite initial impressions that ITS2 is too variable,
it has proven to provide useful biological informa-
tion at higher taxonomic levels, even across all
eukaryotes, thanks to the conserved aspects of its
transcript secondary structure. The review of all
eukaryote groups reveals that ITS2 is expandable,
but always retains in its RNA transcript a common
core structure of two helices with hallmark char-
acteristics important for ribosomal RNA processing.
This aspect of its RNA transcript secondary struc-
ture can rescue difficult alignment problems,
making the ITS2a more powerful tool for
phylogenetics. Equally important, the recognition
of eukaryote-wide homology regions provides
extensive and detailed information to test experi-
mental studies of ribosomal rRNA processing.
INTRODUCTION
Comparative phylogenetics is a powerful tool, not just
for establishing evolutionary relationships among taxa,
but also for discerning biochemically signiﬁcant aspects
of a locus, versus those always present but variable. The 30
nuclear ribosomal transcribed spacer region [second
internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)] sequence is much
used for phylogenetic studies at the species and genus
level. More recently, additional phylogenetically useful
information from these sequences has emerged as a
consequence of the solution of their putative transcript
secondary structure (1). Initial analysis of potential
folding homologies was presented by Wolf et al. (2).
From folding of transcripts of many additional phyla,
it now appears that conservation of secondary structure of
ITS2 itself among essentially all eukaryotes is far more
remarkable than had ever been anticipated. Although the
highly conserved helix regions revealed are presumably
essential for rRNA processing, the details of this complex
activity are not yet fully understood. Here we point out
homologies as they apply across animals, plants and
protistan phyla to call attention to the breadth of
information already available to both phylogenetic studies
and to detailed analyses of ITS processing.
Phylogenetic studies have relied on a variety of DNA
loci. Protistans present probably the most diﬃcult choice
of locus to sequence, for the broad and ancient variety of
cell types encompassed is greater than in fungi, animals
or plants. Among protistans, plastid rbcL has been
sequenced for many algae and mitochondrial cox I for
many non-photosynthetic protistans. However, some
protistans are photosynthetic and some not, even in the
same class; and there are numerous examples of host cells
with plastids transferred from a diﬀerent eukaryote.
As for mitochondria, some protistans are even lacking
standard mitochondrial genomes. These facts make
organelle genes less appealing for broader comparisons.
A single common nuclear locus would seem most
useful, as long as it is appropriate for the task.
What should be its attributes? Such a locus should be
present in all of the chosen taxa, and there should be no
known case of horizontal transfer; and it should identify
the organism to a unique species. One candidate is the
single most frequently sequenced DNA region, with
variability suitable to the species level, the ITS2 in the
nuclear ribosomal gene cistron (3). Here we review the
ITS2 region across eukaryotes and ﬁnd it is not just
speciﬁc to species but also laden with surprisingly
useful information concerning higher relationships, and
clearly constrained in its evolution to maintain certain
regions of transcript secondary structure universal among
eukaryotes. Aspects of these conserved regions should
be useful and very important to future studies of rRNA
processing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
For the various phyla of eukaryotes, sets of ITS2
sequences corresponding to clades of species, genera and
families were sought. Sequences of ITS2 and adjacent
nucleotides were then downloaded from GenBank and
initially aligned using MacVector software (Kodak,
International Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, CT,
USA). RNA transcript foldings were engendered by
mfold Version 3.0 available at http://www.bioinfo.
rpi.edu/applications/mfold/rna/form1.cgi (4), and multi-
ple comparisons, searching for the common structure
within the clade, were carried out. These were aided by
the knowledge of conserved helix II structure, and by the
existence of the highly conserved region of DNA on
the 50 side of helix III. Each ﬁnal alignment was adjusted
to reﬂect pairings in common among the sequences, either
identical or showing compensatory base changes that
conserve the pairing, and the conservation of their
secondary structures was compared.
RESULTS
Eukaryote-universal ITS2 secondary structure
From ITS sequencing and analysis of RNA transcript
secondary structure, a set of near-universal eukaryote
ITS2 structures has emerged, as highlighted in Figure 1 for
a diatom, a green alga, a red alga and yeast. The features
common to eukaryotes were ﬁrst noted during analyses of
the many genera and species of the green algal group
Volvocaceae, and their comparison with terrestrial plants
(5). ITS2 typically has four helices (Figure 1), and helices I
and IV are the most variable (species and subspecies level
speciﬁcity). At least within a genus, the basal pairings of
helices I, II and IV are conserved while the most conserved
portion of helix III is distal. The two helices that we
term II and III, and their adjacent single-stranded regions,
contain the most conserved regions of primary sequence
(Figure 1, cartoon).
However, not all eukaryotes have the same number of
helices, and only helices II and III are recognizable and
common to essentially all. Hence, helix II (recognized by
its hallmarks) may be the ﬁrst helix in, for example, the
typical ciliate ITS2 structure (6). In some groups, insects
particularly, there is commonly a helix between the
recognizable Helix II and Helix III, which we have
termed IIA. Like all the other helices except II, it may
be branched. For global comparisons, it is less confusing
to ignore the total number of helices and concentrate
rather on the two helices that have individually recogniz-
able motifs.
The hallmark helices, helices II and III
Helix II is recognizable because it is short (rarely more
than 12 pairings), it lacks any branching, and it posesses
a pyrimidine–pyrimidine mismatch (arrows in Figure 1),
which makes a bulge near the base of the helix. Figure 4
of (5) illustrates the many variant forms of helix II among
angiosperms, all with the pyrimidine mismatch. The sole
exception to the rule of shortness and no branching is
spectacular. In the genera of ticks studied by Hlinka et al.
(7) there is an insertion of hundreds of nucleotides of long
repeats at the tip of helix II, leading to complicated
branching. These are the longest known ITS2 sequences.
Helix III, by contrast, is typically longer than helix II
and is frequently branched. The region of greatest
absolute sequence conservation in the whole ITS2 is on
the 50 side of helix III near the tip. Even when helix III is
branched, the highly conserved stretch of nucleotides is
found on the 50 side of one of the branches. This sequence,
marked in Figure 1, is typically conserved absolutely at
the family or even higher level. Coelomates and some
other taxa (e.g. 8) have a branched, sometimes much
branched, helix III. Historically this characteristic has
aﬀected the research ﬁeld, because mammalian and
particularly human, helix III of ITS2 is long and multiply
branched. Hence not only is the common secondary
structure diﬃcult to perceive, but the great number of
relatively poorly conserved nucleotides in ITS2 initially
gave the locus a reputation for high variability and
perhaps uselessness for phylogenetic purposes.
Our secondary structure analyses and comparisons
show that, no matter what the total length of ITS2,
100–115 nt positions, consistent in their position in
the secondary structure, are relatively conserved. These
include the basal 10 pairings of helix II and, in helix III,
those 18 pairings that include and surround the single
most absolutely conserved sequence, that on the 50 side
of helix III (see Figure 1 cartoon). The known or proposed
cut sites for transcript processing in yeast and mammals
(9–12) are all in the relatively highly conserved
regions in the 50 half of ITS2 (approximately up to the
tip of helix III). The signiﬁcance of actual sequence
nucleotides has as yet been explored experimentally only
for the pyrimidine–pyrimidine bulge region of helix II in
yeast (13).
The hallmarks of ITS2 secondary structure can now be
recognized in the major groupings of algae and various
other protistans as well as animals, fungi and plants
(see Table 1). We have derived the major transcript
secondary characteristics of many clades, including
in column 7 the most highly conserved sequence on
the 50 side of helix III, using sequence comparisons.
The sequence given in column 7 is common to all of the
taxa cited in column 7. Signiﬁcant omissions from Table 1,
either for lack of suﬃcient sequences in GenBank or
from lack of attention to transcript secondary structure,
include various lesser known animal phyla, plus reptiles
and birds. Among protistans, the trypanosomes and
euglenoids, some Heterokont groups (Dictyochophytes,
Pinguiophytes) and various poorly represented (and
some perhaps yet unknown) protistan groups of ﬂagellates
and amoeboid types (including the photosynthetic
Chlorarachniophytes) are also missing. There is no
reason to expect any exceptional structure of their ITS2;
for trypanosomes, the locus has already proven useful in
delineating species (14).
The utility of the table is severalfold. In total, it
summarizes the remarkable uniformity among eukaryotes
of the fundamental RNA transcript secondary structure
features of ITS2. At a lower taxonomic level, it suggests an

highly conserved sequence region on the 50 side, near the tip (bracket) and its most highly conserved pairings include this region (see cartoon).
Cartoon shows with black ﬁll the relatively conserved regions of sequence. It should be noted that the transcript folding pattern for yeast here is

even greater degree of uniformity within a phylum, and
then within a class. Our choice of4325 nt as a criterion
for excess ITS2 length is entirely arbitrary, providing the
user some hint of expectation. There is no obvious
correlation between ITS2 length and position in the
eukaryote tree, and some phyla contain both long and
short examples.
In all phyla, the relatively highly conserved hallmark
sequences on the 50 side of helix III in Figure 1 display
a certain sameness, a high purine content, particularly
guanine, presumably of functional importance to
processing. In the majority of examples in Table 1, a
YGGY can be found here. Comparison of transcript
foldings at higher taxonomic levels fails to support any
clade-constant positioning of pairing versus bulges in this
most highly conserved sequence, implying some other
aspect as the clue to processing. Finally, the Table serves
not only as a guide to expectation when working on a
group of taxa, but also as a source of citations concerning
detailed RNA folding structure of the phylum, useful for
resolving secondary structure in further taxa. These
citations also serve as an entree into the phylogenetic

analysis literature. The full signiﬁcance of the transcript
secondary structure parallels will not become apparent
until the biochemical details of processing are deciphered.
Exceptions
There are two general types of exception to the rule that
ITS2 has a recognizable helix II and III. The ﬁrst type of
exception is that helix II is present, but a recognizable
helix III seems not to be. Only three disparate groups
exemplify this condition, the coral genus Acropora and its
immediate relatives (as opposed to the remaining stony
corals), at least some of the marine siphonaceous
green algae, and four genera (Tetramitas, Vahlkampﬁa,
Naegleria and Willaertia) of the Valkampﬁidae of
the Heterolobosea. Whether their total ITS2 region is
long or quite short, nothing recognizably comparable
to a standard helix III is found. These organisms all
presumably undergo normal processing of their initial
RNA transcript to produce SSU, 5.8S and LSU RNAs.
The second type of exception is found among a few
genera of parasites, the Diplomonadida Giarda and the
genera of Microsporidia, Nosema, Encephalitozoon and
Vairiomorpha. These organisms lack a free 5.8S RNA
molecule, instead incorporating its homolog within the
50 end of the LSU gene, as in prokaryotes. The resulting
transcript needs no processing of the type requiring
guidance by ITS2 structure. In all of these exceptions,
the region of the 5.8S and what lies between it and the
standard LSU, though short, is still adequate for
identifying to species (e.g. 15,16).
DISCUSSION
Internal transcribed spacers
The term ITS traditionally refers to the entire region
between the nuclear genes for the ribosomal small subunit
(SSU) and the ribosomal large subunit (LSU) RNAs;
ITS1 is the ﬁrst spacer, followed by the 5.8S RNA gene,
and then the ITS2. Both the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the
long RNA transcript are removed, by ‘processing’
enzymes in the nucleolus, which produce the ﬁnal SSU,
5.8S and LSU RNAs for ribosomes. The ‘processing’ is
not yet fully understood in biochemical terms, but it is
clear that the folding pattern, the secondary structure,
of the initial RNA transcript plays a role in guiding
processing (9–12). Hence, not only the sequence but
also the transcript folding patterns of ITS1 and of ITS2
have been objects of study. The second spacer, ITS2,
has received vastly more attention, for plants, animals
and protistans, than the ITS1. More than 100 000 ITS2
sequences can be found in GenBank, and numerous
studies have used this region for phylogenetic analyses.
When both ITS2 and another locus, plastid or mitochon-
drial, have been studied in parallel, the ITS2 has been
found to contain at least as much information, and usually
more (e.g. 17). Its sequence is unique to a species, and
usually to the subspecies level.
Basically, the reason for this is that ITS2 combines both
remarkably conserved with relatively labile stretches of
nucleotides, as shown in the alignment of Hershkovitz and
Lewis (18). The explanation for this apparent alternation
of conserved with variable regions was presented by
Mai and Coleman (5). The regions of greatest sequence
conservation contribute heavily to the pairings in the
helices of the secondary structure that the initial RNA
transcript takes on, as shown in the cartoon in Figure 1.
This secondary structure, in turn, guides processing.
Contributing to the popularity of ITS2 for phylogenetic
analyses is its ease of PCR and sequencing. Because
its primer regions are in the 5.8S and the 50 region of the
large subunit genes of the ribosomal DNA, both utterly
essential genes, they are very highly conserved, yet
oﬀer the possibility of selecting phylum-speciﬁc primers.
Also, ITS2 lengths are generally shorter than 350 nt, easily
sequenced in one run.
One hesitation aﬀecting phylogenetic ITS2 studies has
been the question of alignment of diﬀering sequences,
a question that arises because for proteins, with their
triplet amino acid signature in the DNA sequence, the
alignment is immediately obvious. For DNA regions that
do not code for protein products, alignment of subregions
where sequence diﬀers considerably presents diﬃcult and
often unjustiﬁable options, a facet that has sometimes
led earlier workers to omit the more variable portions of
ITS2 from an alignment. This problem has been largely
overcome with the recognition of the role of transcript
secondary structure, which dictates alignment of paired
positions. The alignment can be done either manually or
by using computer programs (see below).
Theoretical problems
An initial concern with ITS was the fact that there are
typically several hundred copies of the ribosomal RNA
locus in tandem in the nuclear genome (19)—hence there
was the potential for intragenomic variation. It is now
clear that, except as described below, these repeats are
subject to ‘concerted evolution’ (3,20–22), the result of
a poorly understood process of homogenization that
renders the ITS repeats of an organism identical over
very short evolutionary time. Intragenomic variation, if
present at all, is typically only in very few extremely
variable positions that are never paired in secondary
structure. Thus, the ITS2 can be treated as a single gene
(1). For an exhaustive analysis of ITS2 intragenomic
variation, see Pro¨schold et al. (23).
The other potential problems, discussed at length in
Alvarez and Wendel (3) and Bailey et al. (24), concern
hybridization and polyploidy. Clearly if two organisms
diﬀering in their ITS2 sequences hybridize and crossover
occurs, the outcome can confuse the phylogenetic analysis.
There may ultimately be more than one locus of rDNA
genes in the nucleus, there may be mixed ITS2 sequences
within and between arrays, resulting from diﬀering
parents and from crossingover, and there may even be
pseudogene sequences of ITS resulting from degeneration
of one set. Non-functional pseudogenes, in fact, are
readily recognizable by their imperfect 5.8S and for
absence of some or all of the relatively conserved regions
of ITS2, aspects obvious from transcript secondary
structure knowledge. Hybridization, polyploidy and

their consequences, more common in plants than in
animals, can engender confusion, but such situations
are generally recognizable and already suspected in
particular groups under study. The resulting ITS
sequences, containing two or more repeat types, may
then actually prove highly informative in resolving the
phylogenetic problems.
Bonuses
The conservation of basic hallmarks of ITS2 structure
across great taxonomic spans has inspired several novel
approaches to handling major taxonomic categories.
Recently, Landis and Gargas (submitted for publication)
have proposed a method for identiﬁcation of all fungi to
species, using just PCR and a set of sequential 20-mer
primers designed from the ﬁrst half of the ITS2, reﬂecting
the speciﬁcity and stability of helix I, II and the 50portion
of III.
For the four-helix model of ITS2, using the hallmarks
of the helix II pyrimidine mismatch and the longer helix
III with TGGT on the 50 side, Schultz et al. (25) have
automated GenBank searching for ITS2 sequences and
their folding. Subsequently, Wolf et al. (2) and Schultz
et al. (26) have extended automation and set up a website
(http://its2.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de) with
eukaryote-wide representation of exemplar ITS2 folds.
In addition, there is a growing literature on programs
to handle simultaneously sequence alignments and their
secondary structure characteristics, as in Siebert and
Backofen (27), Seibel et al. (28) and Wolf et al. (29).
Biﬀen et al. (30) provide a recent example of the
application of such programs, plus an interesting analysis
of the types and rates of compensatory base change in
SSU versus ITS. These methods appear to work best for
relatively short ITS2 sequences, averaging 200 nt, and
thus have proven particularly applicable to plants and
green algae, fungi, dinoﬂagellates and some metazoan
groups.
A unique advantage of the ITS2 as a choice for
sequencing is that the resulting alignment contains
information related to the level of the biological species
(31). This is an empirical observation that has borne up
for all eukaryote groups investigated so far. The funda-
mental correlation arises from the highly conserved
regions of sequence. In taxonomic groups with fairly
short ITS2 sequences, where these are all identical, the
organisms are observed to be able to intercross experi-
mentally, and if no compensatory base change is present,
at least to some degree. For groups with longer sequences,
the additional regions appear to show lesser evolutionary
constraint, so that one must limit the comparison to only
the most conserved paired positions (the 10 basal pairings
in II and the 18 pairings including and immediately
surrounding the highly conserved 50 sequence of helix III);
these should be identical, or lack any compensatory base
change, for any interbreeding to be possible. Such an
analysis requires a plethora of data, not only ITS2
sequences but experimental interbreeding data; yet exam-
ples have been found among protists (6,8,32), plants (5)
and animals (33,34) to test the hypothesis. An additional
data set arises from the clades of angiosperms endemic to
either the Hawaiian Islands or to Macaronesia, where only
a limited evolutionary time has been available to produce
the endemic genera and species groups now present.
Breeding studies have suggested that none of these groups
has managed to evolve to the point of sexual isolation
(35). Comparisons of the ITS2 sequences, in the nine
genus and species swarms where ITS2 is available, now
agree that all have the expected ITS2 nucleotide identity
(Coleman, in preparation).
In sum, ITS2 is present in essentially all eukaryotes, and
even when truncated, the region is still suﬃcient to allow
identiﬁcation to species and lower. There is no evidence of
any horizontal gene transfer (36). ITS2 PCR and
sequencing are straight forward, and there is rarely any
excessive length. A recognizable short pyrimidine bulge-
containing helix (‘helix II’) and downstream, a longer helix
with highly conserved nucleotide motif on the 50 side
(‘helix III’) are essentially universally present. For the full
biochemical understanding of how ribosomal RNA
processing occurs, the many ITS alignments available
should prove invaluable to test models, and those
few eukaryotes groups (e.g. Acropora corals) lacking
helix III and hence its detailed guidance role in
processing pose a further challenge since they obviously
produce ribosomes. Furthermore, thanks to its conserved
secondary structure aspects, one has a guide, from
sequence and structure alone, to the group of taxa
probably capable of interbreeding. This correlation
allows interesting comparisons of breeding potential
with the idiosyncracies of taxonomic practice at the
species level across eukaryote groups. The ITS2, once
considered a highly variable and largely uninteresting
locus, has proven in fact to be one containing eukaryote-
wide homology, undoubtedly a consequence of its
guidance role in what must be a eukaryote-wide biochem-
istry of ribosome formation.
