Abstract
Background: Twist is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional factor that has been
identified to play an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated metastasis
through the regulation of E-cadherin expression. However, few authors have examined the
expression of Twist and E-cadherin and their prognostic value in patients with esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance
of Twist and E-cadherin expression in ESCC.
Methods: We immunohistochemically investigated the relationship between their expression and
clinicopathological factors including prognosis in surgical specimens of primary tumors in 166
patients with ESCC.
Results: The expression rate of high Twist was 42.0% and that of preserved E-cadherin was 40.4%.
The expression of high Twist and reduced E-cadherin was significantly associated with depth of
tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant nodal metastasis, stage and lymphatic invasion, and
poor prognosis. High Twist expression significantly correlated with reduced E-cadherin expression.
In the preserved E-cadherin group, the 5-year survival rate was better for patients who were low
for Twist expression than for those who were high for Twist expression. Multivariate analysis
indicated that the combination of low Twist and preserved E-cadherin expression was an
independent prognostic factor along with tumor depth, distant nodal metastasis and E-cadherin
expression.
Conclusions: Evaluation of Twist and E-cadherin expressions should be useful for determining
tumor properties, including prognosis, in patients with ESCC.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is essential for
morphogenesis during embryonic development and is a
key event in the tumor invasion and metastatic processes
[1]. E-cadherin, a homophilic Ca2+-dependent cell adhe-
sion molecule located in adherens junctions of epithelia,
plays a critical role in the suppression of tumor invasion;
its loss of function coincides with increased tumor malig-
nancy [2]. Several EMT-inducing regulators repress E-cad-
herin transcription via interaction with specific E-boxes of
the proximal E-cadherin promoter [3]. Snail-related zinc
finger transcription factors are the most prominent ones
and we previously examined the relationship between E-
cadherin and Snail or Slug expression in ESCC, close rela-
tionships were found [4,5]. Twist, a highly conserved
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, has
been recently identified as a developmental gene with a
key role in E-cadherin repression and EMT induction [3].
There has not been any report on the association between
Twist and E-cadherin expression in ESCC. The purpose of
the present study was to examine the clinical significance
of Twist expression in ESCC and the correlation between
Twist and E-cadherin expression in ESCC.
Methods
Patients and specimens
The present study involved 166 patients with ESCC (149
men and 17 women) who underwent curative surgery at
the Kagoshima University Hospital between January 1987
and December 1998. All patients underwent an
esophagectomy with lymph node dissection. The patients
ranged in age from 36 to 84 years (mean, 64.3 years).
None of these patients underwent endoscopic mucosal
resection, palliative resection, preoperative chemotherapy
and/or radiotherapy, and none of them had synchronous
or metachronous multiple cancers in other organs. Speci-
mens of cancer and adjacent noncancerous tissues were
collected from the patients according to the institutional
guidelines of our hospital after informed consent had
been obtained. Classifications of the specimens were
determined according to the International Union Against
Cancer tumor-node-metastasis classification system [6].
All of the M1 tumors had distant lymph node metastases.
All patients were followed up after discharge with a chest
X-ray every 1 to 3 months, computed tomography every 3
to 6 months, and ultrasonography every 6 months. Bron-
choscopy and endoscopy were performed when neces-
sary. Follow-up data after surgery were available for all
patients with a median follow-up period of 24 months
(range, 1-181 months).
Immunohistochemical staining and evaluation
Tumor samples were fixed with 10% formalin in phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS), embedded in paraffin, and
sectioned into 3-μm slices. They were deparaffinized in
xylene and dehydrated with a series of graded ethanol. For
antigen retrieval, sections were heated in 10 mM citrate
buffer solution for 15 minutes at 95°C for Twist and for
10 minutes at 120°C for E-cadherin, respectively. The
endogenous peroxidase activity of specimens was blocked
by immersing the slides in a 0.3% hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) solution in methanol for 30 minutes at room tem-
perature. After washing three times with PBS for 5 minutes
each, the sections were treated with 1% bovine serum
albumin for 30 minutes to block nonspecific reactions at
room temperature. The blocked sections were incubated
with primary antibody Twist (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA; H-81, 1:100) or E-cadherin (Takara Bio-
technology, Otsu City, Japan, 1:100), diluted in PBS at
4°C for overnight, followed by staining with a streptavi-
din-biotin peroxidase kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). The
sections were washed in PBS for 5 minutes three times and
the immune complex was visualized by incubating the
sections with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. The
sections were rinsed briefly in water, counterstained with
hematoxylin, and mounted. Normal esophageal epithe-
lium and invasive lobular carcinoma were used as positive
controls for E-cadherin and Twist, respectively. Negative
controls were created by replacing the primary antibodies
with PBS. Evaluation of immunohistochemistry was inde-
pendently carried out by two investigators (K.S. and I.S.)
who were unaware of the clinical data or disease outcome.
In cases in which the results of immunohistochemical
expression differed between the two observers, slides were
evaluated by a third observer (S.N.). For Twist, cytoplas-
mic immunoreactivity was scored by its extent and inten-
sity. Staining intensity was graded as follows: negative (0),
weak (1), moderate (2) and strong (3). Staining extent
was rated according to the percentage of positive cells.
Samples with no stained tumor cells were rated as 0, those
with < 25% of stained tumor cells were rated as 1, those
with 25-50% of stained tumor cells were rated as 2, those
with 50-75% of stained tumor cells were rated as 3 and
those with > 75% of stained tumor cells were rated as 4.
The results of staining intensity and extent gave an overall
staining score. An overall staining score of 0-5 and 6-7
were regarded as low and high Twist expression, respec-
tively. For E-cadherin, cancer cells were divided into two
groups: preserved expression, which indicates cells with
the same level of expression as that of normal epithelium
distant enough from tumor, and reduced expression,
which indicates cells with weak or absent expression com-
pared with normal epithelium (Fig. 1) [7]. To evaluate
expression of Twist and E-cadherin, ten fields (within the
tumor and at the invasive front) were selected and expres-
sion in 1000 tumor cells (100 cells/field) was evaluated
using high-power (×200) microscopy.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of group differences was done using the
X2 and Wilcoxon tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used for survival analysis and differences in survival werePage 2 of 9

Results
Expressions of Twist and E-cadherin in esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma
Twist expression was observed in the cytoplasm of cancer
cells in 42.0% of all patients (70 of 166; Fig. 1A). E-cad-
herin expression was observed on the cell membrane of
cancer cells, indicating preserved expression, in 40.4% of
all patients (67 of 166; Fig. 1B).
Relationship between the expressions of Twist and E-
cadherin and clinicopathological findings
The expression of Twist and E-cadherin was significantly
associated with the following clinicopathological param-
eters: depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis,
distant nodal metastasis, stage and lymphatic invasion.
Tumors with high Twist expression invaded deeper (P =
0.0044), had more lymph node metastasis (P = 0.038),
had more distant nodal metastasis (P = 0.0073), had a
more advanced stage (P = 0.0011) and had more lym-
phatic invasion (P = 0.0011) than those that were low
Twist expression. Tumors with reduced E-cadherin expres-
sion invaded deeper (P < 0.0001), had more lymph node
metastasis (P < 0.0001), had more distant nodal metasta-
sis (P = 0.002), had a more advanced stage (P < 0.0001)
and had more lymphatic invasion (P = 0.0008) than those
that were preserved E-cadherin expression. Presence of
high Twist expression significantly correlated with
reduced E-cadherin expression (P = 0.0076) (Table 1).
Relationship between Twist expression and 
clinicopathological findings according to E-cadherin 
expression
The tumors were divided into the preserved E-cadherin
group and reduced E-cadherin group. In the E-cadherin
preserved group, the expression of Twist was related to
lymphatic invasion; in the E-cadherin reduced group, the
expression of Twist was related to depth of tumor invasion
and stage (Table 2).
Relationship between prognosis and expression of Twist 
and E-cadherin
Seven of the patients died of postoperative complications
within 30 days of the beginning of the study period, leav-
ing 159 patients for survival analysis. The 5-year survival
rate of patients with tumors with low and high Twist
expression was 41.6%, whereas the rate for high Twist
expression was 23.0%.There was a significant difference in
5-year survival rate between low and high expression of
Twist (P = 0.0014; Fig. 2A). The 5-year survival rate of
patients with tumors with preserved and reduced E-cad-
herin expression was 48.7% and 23.3%, respectively, and
the difference was significant (P = 0.0007; Fig. 2B).
Relationship between prognosis and Twist expression in 
the preserved and reduced E-cadherin groups
In the preserved E-cadherin group, the 5-years survival
rate was significantly higher for patients low for Twist
expression than for those high for Twist expression (P =
0.0099; Fig. 3A). However, in the E-cadherin reduced
group, there was no significant difference between
patients high and low for Twist expression (Fig. 3B).
Moreover, the 5-years survival rate was significantly worse
in patients with high Twist and reduced E-cadherin
expression tumors than those with low Twist and pre-
served E-cadherin expression (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4).
Univariate and multivariate analyses of survival
Univariate analysis showed that the following factors were
significantly related to postoperative survival: tumor
depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, stage,
lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, Twist expression, E-
cadherin expression and the combination of Twsit and E-
cadherin expression (P < 0.05). Multivariate regression
analysis indicated that depth of invasion, distant metasta-
sis, E-cadherin expression and the combination of Twsit
and E-cadherin expression were independent prognostic
factors (Table 3).
Discussion
Ectopic expression of Twist results in loss of E-cadherin-
mediated cell-cell adhesion, activation of mesenchymal
markers, and induction of cell motility, suggesting that
Twist contributes to tumor invasiveness, metastasis and
prognosis by promoting an EMT [3]. Recently, up-regula-
tion of Twist has been reported in several types of human
cancer [3,8-12]. The rates of high Twist and reduced E-cad-
herin expression have been reported as 36-60% and 44-
74%, respectively [12-17].
In our present investigation, immunohistochemistry
demonstrated that rates of high Twist and reduced E-cad-
herin expression were 42.0 and 40.4%. Upregulation of
Twist [14] expression has been associated with high inci-
dence of distant metastasis and downregulation of E-cad-
herin [15,18] expression has been associated with high
incidence of lymph node metastasis in ESCC. In this
study, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis,
distant nodal metastasis, stage and lymphatic invasion
were significantly associated with high Twist or reduced E-
cadherin expression.
Additionally, presence of high Twist expression signifi-
cantly correlated with reduced E-cadherin expression.Page 4 of 9

Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research 2009, 28:158 http://www.jeccr.com/content/28/1/158Inverse correlation between high Twist and reduced E-cad-
herin expression has been found in liver, endometrial,
bladder and prostate human cancer cells [12,13,19,20].
Thus, the present results are almost consistent with previ-
ous reports. Prognosis was poorer in patients with high
Twist expression than in those with low Twist expression.
Similarly, the prognosis was worse in patients with
reduced E-cadherin than those in with preserved E-cad-
herin expression, which agrees with previous reports. The
patients with both low Twist and preserved E-cadherin
expression had the best clinical outcome according to uni-
variate analysis and it was an independent prognostic fac-
tor on multivariate analysis. On the strength of these data,
we speculate that high Twist expression may promote
EMT by dysregulation of the E-cadherin expression pat-
tern in ESCC.
However, some patients with preserved E-cadherin
expression had poor prognosis. In the preserved E-cad-
herin group, the patients were high for Twist expression
had more lymphatic invasion and worse prognosis. Thus,
it seems that Twist not only suppresses the function of E-
cadherin but also promotes lymphatic invasion in the pre-
served E-cadherin group and several hypotheses might

Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research 2009, 28:158 http://www.jeccr.com/content/28/1/158explain. Twist has been recently identified as a develop-
mental gene with a key role in E-cadherin repression and
EMT induction. Twist gene is also a newly-know potential
oncogene and metastasis related gene [3,21]. Twist can
inhibit myc oncogene- and p53-dependent apoptosis in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts [21] and NF-κB pathway
dependent apoptosis [22]. It also suppresses cellular dif-
ferentiation and protects apoptosis through inhibition of
p21WAF1/Cip1, inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, via
both p53-dependent and independent pathways [23].
Mesenchyme Forkhead 1 (FOXC2) which induced by
Twist, Snail, Goosecoid and TGF-β1 plays a central role in
promoting invasion and metastasis in human basal-like
breast cancers [24]. Twist expression is regulated by Wnt/
β-catenin signaling and that both Wnt and Twist can func-
tion as inhibitors of lactogenic differentiation, an effect
that could contribute to mammary tumorigenesis [25].
These reports might explain the aggressive behavior of the
patients with high Twist expression.
Snail, Slug and Twist are transcriptional factors that regu-
late the expression of E-cadherin. We have previously
studied the expression of Snail [4], Slug [5] and Twist [this
study] in ESCC patients. Subjects were 194, 206 and 166,
respectively, of which 110 were shared subjects. We reex-
amined the correlation of the expression of Snail, Slug,
Twist and E-cadherin in 110 ESCC patients. The expres-
sion of Twist was significantly associated with Snail, Slug
and E-cadherin, respectively (P = 0.0266, P = 0.0137 and
P = 0.0024). The univariate analyses of combination of
Twist and Snail expression (Twist negative + Snail nega-
tive/others) and Twist and Slug expression (Twist negative
+ Slug negative/others) showed significantly correlation,
respectively (P = 0.0015 and P = 0.0017). These data dem-
onstrated that all three transcription factors have inappro-
priate expressed in ESCC and these factors are
significantly correlated with each other.

Twist or E-cadherin expression was associated with tumor
properties, including depth of tumor invasion, lymph
node metastasis, distant nodal metastasis, stage, lym-
phatic invasion and prognosis. Evaluation of Twist and/or
E-cadherin expression is useful for determining malignant
properties, including clinical outcome in patients with
ESCC.
