Crystal Structure of a
Mammalian Voltage-Dependent
Shaker Family Kþ Channel
Stephen B. Long, Ernest B. Campbell, Roderick MacKinnon*
Voltage-dependent potassium ion (Kþ) channels (Kv channels) conduct Kþ
ions across the cell membrane in response to changes in the membrane
voltage, thereby regulating neuronal excitability by modulating the shape and
frequency of action potentials. Here we report the crystal structure, at a
resolution of 2.9 angstroms, of a mammalian Kv channel, Kv1.2, which is a
member of the Shaker Kþ channel family. This structure is in complex with an
oxido-reductase b subunit of the kind that can regulate mammalian Kv
channels in their native cell environment. The activation gate of the pore is
open. Large side portals communicate between the pore and the cytoplasm.
Electrostatic properties of the side portals and positions of the T1 domain and
b subunit are consistent with electrophysiological studies of inactivation
gating and with the possibility of Kþ channel regulation by the b subunit.
Voltage-dependent Kþ (Kv) channels are
members of the voltage-dependent cation
channel family, which includes the voltage-
dependent Kþ, Naþ, and Ca2þ channels (1).
These channels are present in all the major
kingdoms of life. In eukaryotic cells, they work
in concert with other ion channels to produce
and modulate the electrical activity of the cell.
This electrical activity is important for many
processes in electrically excitable cells such as
neurons and muscle, as well as in nonexcitable
cells (1). In the quintessential excitable cell, the
neuron, Kv channels return the membrane volt-
age to its negative resting value after an action
potential, modulate the shape of action poten-
tials, and set the action potential firing rate (1).
Most of our knowledge of Kv channel
function comes from studies of the Shaker Kþ
channel from Drosophila melanogaster and its
family members from mammalian cells (2).
Shaker family channels have been extensively
studied with electrophysiology, because they
can easily be expressed in Xenopus laevis
oocytes and in other cells. In contrast, nearly
all of our knowledge of Kþ channel structure
is based on studies of prokaryotic Kþ channels,
because they are more easily expressed at high
levels in Escherichia coli. Such studies have
taught us much about their pores, selectivity
filters, and gates (3).
Eukaryotic Kv channels in many respects
are very similar to their prokaryotic counter-
parts. The selectivity filter sequence is so con-
served that we expect its structure to be
essentially the same in all Kþ channels. The
pore_s Binverted teepee[ arrangement of inner
helices, which holds the selectivity filter in its
wider half near the extracellular surface, is also
expected to be a conserved feature (4). How-
ever, beyond their conserved pore and certain
domains that regulate the opening of the pore_s
gate, eukaryotic Kv channels have certain
unique features. For example, in the S6 inner
helix (on the intracellular side of the selectivity
filter), a highly conserved triplet sequence,
Pro-X-Pro (where X is any amino acid), is
present in Shaker family Kv channels but not
in prokaryotic Kv channels. Mutations show
that this sequence is very important for gating,
but the reason why has yet to be determined
(5, 6). There has been speculation that this
region of the pore (the inner pore), which is
lined by the S6 inner helices, is different in
Shaker Kv channels (5, 7) than in prokaryotes.
Shaker family Kv channels have an adap-
tation that, as far as we know, does not exist in
prokaryotic Kv channels, and apparently allows
them to carry out tasks that are unique to
eukaryotic cells. Preceding the first membrane-
spanning helix, S1, the N terminus forms a T1
domain inside the cell (8–11). Four T1 do-
mains, one from each of the four Shaker Kv
channel subunits, come together to form a tet-
rameric assembly at the intracellular mem-
brane surface. This domain is located directly
over the pore entryway to the cytoplasm,
which means that the transmembrane pore
must communicate with the cytoplasm through
side portals in order to allow Kþ ions to flow
freely between the cell and the transmembrane
pore (12–14). These portals not only permit
Kþ ions, but they also must be large enough to
allow the entry of a polypeptide chain from the
channel_s N terminus, which functions as an
inactivation gate in some Shaker family Kv
channels (15, 16).
The T1 domain in eukaryotic Kv chan-
nels is a docking platform for the b subunit
(12, 17, 18). The b subunit forms a tetramer of
proteins related to aldo-keto reductase enzymes,
which are oxido-reductases dependent on
NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate), with a-b
barrel structures (19–24). Crystal structures of
a b subunit tetramer and of a b-T1 domain
complex showed that the enzyme_s active site
contains an NADPþ cofactor and catalytic
residues for hydride transfer (12, 24). The b
subunit active site is mysterious because its
function is still unknown. Is it an enzyme that
can be regulated by a Kv channel or does it
serve as a sensor for the Kv channel, allowing
the redox state of a cell to influence elec-
trical activity at the membrane? Nearly all
Shaker family Kv channels in the mamma-
lian nervous system are associated with these
oxido-reductase b subunits (25).
Experimental evidence suggests that voltage-
dependent gating is fundamentally similar in
prokaryotic and eukaryotic Kv channels and
that their voltage sensors are structurally
similar (26–29). But structural studies with
Shaker family Kv channels have the potential
to be more informative. The structures of the
prokaryotic Kv channel KvAP suggest that
an intact lipid membrane is required to keep
the voltage sensors correctly oriented with
respect to the pore (30) Esee also Protein Data
Bank (PDB) ID 2A0L^. Because the mem-
brane is removed during isolation of the chan-
nel, this requirement has so far obscured all
attempts to deduce the structural basis for
electro-mechanical coupling between the volt-
age sensor and the pore. The voltage sensor in
Shaker family Kv channels is constrained by
its attachment to a cytoplasmic T1 domain, and
therefore may maintain its tenuous but impor-
tant connections to the pore.

(31) was coexpressed with the b2 Kþ channel
b subunit from rat brain (32) in the yeast
Pichia pastoris as described in (33) with mod-
ifications (34). The protein was purified and
crystallized (34). Throughout purification
and crystallization, it was necessary to keep
the protein in a mixture of detergent (n-
dodecyl-b-D-maltopyranoside or n-decyl-b-D-
maltopyranoside) and lipids {1-palmitoyl-2-

Electron density for the transmembrane pore
and voltage sensors visible in initial maps (Fig.
1A) allowed us to construct a model through
cycles of model building, refinement, and map
calculation. Figure 1B shows the structure of
the crystal lattice, which consists of layers of
membrane-spanning regions (pore and voltage
sensors in red) alternating with extramembra-
nous regions (T1 domains and b subunits in
blue). This arrangement closely mimics a na-
tive membrane organization with coplanar ar-
rays of transmembrane elements pointed in the
same direction. The quality of electron density
varies over the molecule, with T1 and b
stronger (mean B factor 0 59 )2), and the
pore (mean B factor 0 159 )2) and voltage
sensor (mean B factor 0 162 )2) weaker. This
variation is understandable in terms of lattice
contacts within the crystal and in terms of
the function of different components of the
channel. The T1 domains and b subunits are
rigid structures and well packed in the b
subunit layer. The pore is somewhat more
flexible in the inner leaflet of the membrane,
and the voltage sensors are highly mobile
domains that are suspended, making few con-
tacts with neighboring protein molecules. The
b subunit, T1 domain, pore (S5, pore helix,
filter, and S6), and the S4-S5 linker helix were
built as essentially complete models with most
side chains included. Four main transmem-
brane segments of the voltage sensor (S1 to
S4) were built without connecting the loops
S1-S2, S2-S3, and S3-S4. Prior knowledge of
the KvAP structure was helpful in building the
voltage sensor, because electron density for
side chains was weakest in this region of the
channel. The linker connecting the T1 domain
to S1 was built as two poly-glycine helices.
The complete Kv1.2 channel–b2 subunit
complex has fourfold symmetry correspond-
ing to the tetrad axis of the I4 unit cell (Fig. 2,
A to C). The dimensions of the tetramer are
approximately 135 ) by 95 ) by 95 ). The
pore and four voltage sensors are È30 ) in
length across the membrane, corresponding
to the known thickness of the hydrophobic
core of the membrane. The T1 domain and b
subunit are each È40 ) in length along the
fourfold axis. The T1 domain is offset (par-
allel to the fourfold axis) from the intra-
cellular pore opening by È15 to 20 ). The
a-helical T1-S1 linker appears to function as
a spacer to maintain separation between the
transmembrane pore and intracellular regions
of the channel.

The a helices of the ion conduction pore
(S5, pore helix, and S6) (Fig. 2B) relate to the
a helices of the voltage sensor in an unex-
pected manner. The voltage sensor is latched
around the pore of an adjacent subunit. This is
most easily appreciated by viewing the channel
along its fourfold axis from outside the cell
and noting the manner in which the pore and
voltage-sensor units engage each other around
the tetramer (Fig. 2C). The connection be-
tween the pore and the voltage sensor of a
given subunit is made by the S4-S5 linker
helix, which runs parallel to the intracellular
membrane surface just at the level of the inner-
helix bundle crossing (Fig. 2, A and B). The
inner-helix bundle was defined in the KcsA (a
non–voltage-dependent Kþ channel) channel
as the right-handed bundle of four inner helices
(one from each subunit, S6 in Kv1.2) that line
the pore on the intracellular side of the
selectivity filter (Fig. 3, A and B) (4). This

bundle structure is important because it forms
an expandable constriction (the bundle crossing)
for opening and closing the ion-conduction
pore, known as the activation gate.
In the Kv1.2-b2 crystal structure, the
voltage-sensor helices are somewhat tilted in
the membrane, but they have a native-like
transmembrane orientation with hydrophilic
loops between helices at the membrane sur-
faces. In the accompanying Research Article
(35), which is focused on voltage-dependent
gating, we outline the evidence that the
connections between the voltage sensors and
pore have maintained a native configuration.
The ion conduction pore. The structures
of four different prokaryotic Kþ channels have
been determined by x-ray crystallography,
including KcsA (4, 36), MthK (37) (a Ca2þ-
gated Kþ channel), KirBac (38) (an inward-
rectifier Kþ channel), and KvAP (30) (a
voltage-dependent Kþ channel). A comparison
of these channel structures emphasizes two
important aspects of Kþ channels: (i) the
structure of the Kþ selectivity filter on the
extracellular side of the pore is highly con-
served; and (ii) the inner pore (between the
selectivity filter and intracellular solution)
varies in its conformation. Structural conser-
vation of the selectivity filter underlies the
conserved mechanism of selective ion conduc-
tion in Kþ channels, whereas variation of the
inner pore structure is related to conformation-
al changes that open and close the pore. In the
published structures, KcsA and KirBac appear
to be closed on the basis of the dimensions of
the pore at the narrowest point of the inner-
helix bundle (Fig. 3, A and B, the bundle
crossing), whereas MthK and KvAP appear to
be open. In Fig. 3, A and B, two subunits of the
Kv1.2 pore (red) have been superimposed on
KcsA (closed, gray) and KvAP (opened, blue)
(KvAP inner helices are in a similar position to
MthK inner helices). The inner helices of Kv1.2
are in between KcsA and KvAP but much closer
to KvAP at the inner-helix bundle crossing. The
pore of Kv1.2 has a diameter of about 12 ) at
the bundle crossing, suggesting that the pore in
the crystal structure is open.
The superposition of pores in Fig. 3 pro-
vides a vivid picture of the large inner-helical
motions that must occur when a Kþ channel
opens. Functional studies in Shaker Kþ chan-
nels are consistent with this picture (39, 40).
The accessibility of site-directed cysteine
residues introduced into the inner helices
points to the bundle crossing as the functional
constriction for closure. Positions ‘‘below’’ the
bundle crossing react with sulfhydryl reagents
added to the intracellular side of the membrane
whether or not the channel is open, but po-
sitions ‘‘above’’ the bundle crossing require
the channel to open (40). A tight constriction
prevents even Agþ ions from passing the
bundle crossing when the Shaker Kþ channel’s
pore is closed, but after it opens, large organic
quaternary ammonium cations and hydropho-
bic polypeptides can enter into the inner pore
and plug Kv channels (15, 16, 41, 42).
The inner helices of Kv1.2 contain the
amino acid sequence Pro-Val-Pro, which is
highly conserved among Shaker family Kv
channels. These amino acids curve the S6
inner helices so that they run almost parallel to
the membrane near the intracellular surface
(Fig. 2B and Fig. 3, A and B). Curved inner
helices appear to be a specialized adaptation
for Kv channels, not Shaker channels per se. In
KvAP, a prokaryotic Kv channel, a Gly resi-
due produces a similar curvature of the inner
helices (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the sequence
Pro-X-Pro is one way to produce the curve and
glycine is another. Both achieve the same
structural requirement. In (35), we show why a
curved inner helix is required for coupling the
voltage sensor to the pore in Kv channels.
The a-helical linkers connecting the T1
domain to S1 project in a radial direction out-
ward from the channel’s central axis to create a
wide space between the T1 domain and the pore
(Fig. 2A). This would seem to accomplish two
functions: It would allow the inner helices to
undergo their large gating movements to open
the pore without interference from the T1
domain or linkers, and it would provide low-
resistance diffusion pathways between the pore
entryway and the cytoplasm. A surface ren-
dering of Kv1.2 shows one of these diffusion
pathways, termed a side portal, above the T1
domain (Fig. 4A). Four side portals each have
a diameter of 15 to 20 ). The electrostatic
potential of this region will attract cations
owing to the presence of multiple negatively
charged amino acids on the surface (Fig. 4A,
red), particularly on the rim of the side portals.
This feature of the channel is reminiscent of
the intracellular entryway to the acetylcholine
receptor ion channel (43).
The dimensions and electrostatic properties
of the side portals provide information on an

solution. Channels were superimposed by aligning main-chain atoms of the selectivity filter and

important form of gating known as N-type or
‘‘ball and chain’’ inactivation that occurs in a
subset of Shaker family Kv channels (15, 16).
After membrane depolarization, this subset
produces transient Kþ currents called ‘‘A cur-
rents,’’ rather than sustained ‘‘delayed rectifier’’
Kþ currents (1). A-current channels and
delayed-rectifier channels confer different
electrical behaviors on cells. For example,
delayed-rectifier channels such as Kv1.2 return
the membrane potential promptly to its resting
value after an action potential, whereas A-
current channels allow certain neurons to fire
action potentials at a frequency proportional to
the total synaptic input current from other
neurons (44). From a structural perspective,
the distinction between A-current channels and
delayed rectifiers is subtle: A-current channels
have just the right composition of amino acids
on their intracellular N terminus—or on the N
terminus of an associated b subunit—to allow
the terminus itself to enter the inner pore and
plug (inactivate) the Kv channel after it opens
its activation gate (15, 16, 32). This kind of N
terminus, called an inactivation gate or in-
activation peptide, makes an A-current Kv
channel transient. Upon membrane depolar-
ization, the pore opens and conducts Kþ ions,
but shortly thereafter it becomes inactivated,
as demonstrated by Aldrich and colleagues
(15, 16). These authors also defined the amino
acids necessary for the N terminus to inacti-
vate the pore of a Shaker family Kv channel
(45, 46). The first È10 amino acids should be
predominantly hydrophobic, followed by a
sequence of hydrophilic and positively charged
amino acids. They concluded that the hydro-
phobic stretch becomes buried in a hydrophobic
environment and that the hydrophilic region is
important for long-range electrostatic interac-
tions between the inactivation gate and pore.
Further studies using the mammalian homolog
of Shaker, Kv1.4, led to the proposal that the
hydrophobic region of the N terminus (of a b
subunit inactivation peptide) reaches into the
inner pore, which is lined by hydrophobic
amino acids, and that positively charged amino
acids from the hydrophilic region make elec-
trostatic interactions with negatively charged
amino acids from the T1 domain and linkers to
S1 (12, 47). We can now see in the Kv1.2 struc-
ture that the corresponding negatively charged
amino acids reside on the surface of the side
portals (Fig. 4A, asterisk). It is easy to imagine
an inactivation peptide in an A-current Kv
channel snaking through a side portal with its
positive amino acids lying against the negative
surface and its hydrophobic amino acids ex-
tending to the inner pore (Fig. 4B).
Relationship between the pore, T1
domain, and b subunit catalytic site. The
first and, to date, the only firmly established
role of b subunits of Shaker Kv channels is to
confer inactivation (32, 48). The b
1
subunit has
on its N terminus an amino acid sequence that
has the chemical requirements described above
for an inactivation peptide. Thus, when b
1
is
coexpressed with a Shaker Kv channel, it
produces N-type inactivation (32). The N ter-
minus of the structured region of the b
2
subunit
in the Kv1.2-b
2
complex is located roughly 80
) from the pore, whereas the N terminus of the
structured region of the channel (T1) is about
50 ) from the pore (Fig. 2B). Shaker Kv
channels that possess N-type inactivation pep-
tides have at least 30 additional amino acids
preceding the T1 domain, and the b
1
subunit
has approximately 70 additional amino acids on
its N terminus. As extended polypeptide chains,
these N termini are easily long enough to reach
the pore to produce N-type inactivation.
The b subunits probably have other func-
tions besides inactivation, because not all b sub-
units have an N terminal inactivation peptide.
For example, the b
2
subunit used to produce the
Kv1.2-b2 crystals, although nearly identical to
b
1
through the structured region of b
2
(amino
acid 36 to 361), does not have an N terminal
inactivation sequence and does not produce
inactivation when associated with Kv channels
in membranes (48, 49). The b subunits must

membrane channel are passages connecting the cytoplasm to the pore. (B) Hypothetical model for the
binding of an inactivation peptide to the channel. A portion of the surface of the T1 and integral membrane
components of the complex is shown in the same orientation and colored as in (A). An inactivation peptide
corresponding to the 22 N-terminal residues of b1 has been modeled in an extended conformation to
enter a side portal and plug the inner pore of the channel. Three positive residues (þ) located at positions
13, 15, and 20 from the N terminus were placed at the site of interaction with the negatively charged
patch of residues on T1 [asterisk (12)], whereas the hydrophobic residues at the N terminus were placed
at the inner pore where they are known to bind and block the flow of potassium (47). To show entry of
the peptide’s N terminus into the inner pore in this figure, the following portions of the channel
subunit closest to the viewer were removed: residues 312 to 329 (S4-S5 linker and part of S5) and
residues 405 to 421 (the C-terminal end of S6.) The figure was generated with GRASP software (55).

have additional functions. The observation that
b subunits can influence levels of channel
expression has led to one hypothesis that they
may function as chaperones for the channel
(50, 51). The presence of conserved catalytic
residues for hydride transfer in the enzyme
active site of b subunits forms the basis of
another hypothesis, that b subunits are impor-
tant for a catalytic function (22–24). The Kv
channel could regulate the activity of the b
subunit, or perhaps more likely, the b subunit
could regulate the activity of the channel. A b
subunit ‘‘redox sensor’’ would allow direct
coupling of membrane electrical activity to the
redox state of a cell.
The active site of b subunits has an
NADPþ cofactor and catalytic residues for
hydride transfer. This cofactor is present in the
Kv1.2-b2 crystal structure (Fig. 5A). In
addition, there is poorly defined extra density
overlying the active site in all of our electron
density maps (Fig. 5B). The surface of the
active-site cleft, where this material is bound,
is quite hydrophobic and has many aromatic
amino acids (Fig. 5B). The density is probably
either from a polypeptide chain or from a large
organic molecule. If it represents a polypeptide
chain, it could either be part of the channel or
it could be co-isolated with the channel during
purification. The channel in the crystal struc-
ture contains 31 disordered amino acids on its
N terminus (N terminal to T1) and 78 on its C
terminus. Binding either the N terminus or the
C terminus near the b subunit active site, with
an affinity that depends on whether the co-
factor is oxidized or reduced, could affect Kv
channel function. For example, in some Shaker
family Kv channels, binding of the polypeptide
chain preceding T1 could affect the availability
of the inactivation gate. The C-terminal poly-
peptide could potentially influence gating
because it is connected directly to the inner
helices, which must undergo large movements
to gate the pore open and closed. The Kv1.2-
b2 crystal structure should help in the design
of experiments to test these ideas.
Summary. This work describes the crystal
structure of the mammalian Shaker family Kv
channel Kv1.2 in complex with the b
2
subunit.
Both proteins were coexpressed in Pichia
pastoris. Two critical factors were essential
for obtaining crystals and determining the
structure. A mixture of lipids and detergent
was used throughout purification and crystal-
lization, and many steps were taken to min-
imize oxidation. The importance of lipids in
this project may suggest the general applica-
tion of lipids in membrane protein structural
studies in the future. The I4 crystal lattice
of alternating ‘‘membrane’’ and water layers
comes very close to a native arrangement for
the channel. The relationships between the in-
tegral membrane components, the intracellular
T1 domain, and the b subunit bound to the T1
domain are consistent with electrophysio-
logical studies of the inactivation process in
Shaker Kþ channels. The pore of Kv1.2 is
similar in structure to that of prokaryotic Kþ
channels. Curved inner helices are produced
by the sequence Pro-X-Pro in Shaker family
Kþ channels and by Gly in KvAP and
probably many other Kv channels. The Kv1.2
pore is in an open conformation. Large side
portals between the T1 domain and the pore
connect the pore to the cytoplasm. Electrostatic
properties of the side portals are consistent
with long-range electrostatic steering of in-
activation peptides. An NADPþ cofactor, cata-
lytic residues, and extra density at the b
subunit active-site cleft suggest experiments
for testing the influence of b subunit catalytic
function on Kþ channel activity. The voltage
sensors are in the ‘‘membrane’’ layer of the
crystal and appear to be unperturbed.

Voltage Sensor of Kv1.2:
Structural Basis of
Electromechanical Coupling
Stephen B. Long, Ernest B. Campbell, Roderick MacKinnon*
Voltage-dependent ion channels contain voltage sensors that allow them to
switch between nonconductive and conductive states over the narrow range
of a few hundredths of a volt. We investigated the mechanism by which these
channels sense cell membrane voltage by determining the x-ray crystal
structure of a mammalian Shaker family potassium ion (Kþ) channel. The
voltage-dependent Kþ channel Kv1.2 grew three-dimensional crystals, with an
internal arrangement that left the voltage sensors in an apparently native
conformation, allowing us to reach three important conclusions. First, the
voltage sensors are essentially independent domains inside the membrane.
Second, they perform mechanical work on the pore through the S4-S5 linker
helices, which are positioned to constrict or dilate the S6 inner helices of the
pore. Third, in the open conformation, two of the four conserved Arg residues
on S4 are on a lipid-facing surface and two are buried in the voltage sensor.
The structure offers a simple picture of how membrane voltage influences the
open probability of the channel.
Voltage-dependent ion channels open in re-
sponse to changes in voltage across the cell
membrane (1). In this process, the membrane
electric field performs mechanical work to alter
the channel_s conformation within the mem-
brane. The work arises from the force exerted
by the electric field on charged amino acids,
termed gating charges (1–3). The size of the
gating charge is very large (4), accounting for
the exquisite sensitivity of voltage-dependent
ion channels to small changes in membrane
voltage. To understand this process, one must
first answer two questions: How do gating
charges move within the membrane electric
field? And how are these movements mechan-
ically coupled to opening and closing of the
pore?
No experimentally based model has yet
provided answers to both of these questions.
So far, little progress has been made toward
the second question concerning the mechanical
coupling of voltage-sensor movements to the
pore. Most effort has focused on how the
gating charges move; the main subject of study
has been the Shaker voltage-dependent Kþ
(Kv) channel, and numerous models have been
put forth. One fundamental constraint for any
model is that when a Shaker Kþ channel
opens, it transfers the net equivalent of 12 to
14 positive elementary charges across the
membrane electric field from inside to outside,
and most of this charge is carried by four S4
Arg residues on each of four identical channel
subunits (4–6).
A guiding assumption underlying most
models for the voltage sensor has been that
the S4 helix with its Arg residues is completely
(7–10), or mostly (11), sequestered from the
membrane, in order to protect the charges from
the lipid_s low dielectric environment. To ac-
complish this, most models postulate that the
S4 helix inserts into a groove at the interface
between adjacent subunits of the Kþ channel
tetramer, such that pore a helices S5 and S6
form a wall on one side of S4 and voltage-
sensor a helices S1 to S3 form a wall on the
other side, the lipid-facing perimeter, to create
a gating channel or protein-lined canaliculus
for S4 (7–10, 12). This arrangement would
allow the S4 helix to move its charged amino
acids across the membrane without exposing
them to the lipid environment.
How and to what extent S4 moves has been
the subject of much debate. Gating-dependent
reactivity of sulfhydryl reagents with cysteine
residues led to an initial hypothesis of large
(È15 )) translations of S4 in some models
(13–17). But very small distance changes
measured in fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) experiments suggested much
smaller movements of S4 across the membrane
(18, 19). Crevices surrounding S4 were in-
voked to account for the sulfhydryl reactivity
in the setting of these smaller movements, with
translations and/or rotations of S4 occurring
across a narrow neck inside an hourglass-
shaped canaliculus. In the transporter model
hypothesis, the S4 does not change its depth
in the membrane at all (less than 3 ) move-
ment) (18, 20). Instead, the field is moved
over the S4 charges by alternately opening and
closing crevices to the internal and external
solutions.
The above models of voltage-dependent
gating vary in detail, but they have had two
essential features in common. First, the S4
helix is sequestered from the lipid membrane
Ealthough Larsson and colleagues proposed that
a surface of S4 could be exposed to lipid (11)^.
Second, the voltage-sensor helices S1 to S4 are
packed tightly against the a helices of the pore.
In other words, it was reasonably assumed that
voltage-dependent ion channels are like con-
ventional a-helical membrane proteins that
form a fairly rigid disk of helices in the mem-
brane. A first hint that a rigid disk of helices
might not pertain to voltage-dependent ion
channels came from the demonstration that the
voltage sensor (S1 to S4) from the Shaker Kv
channel could be spliced onto the pore of
KcsA (a non–voltage-dependent Kþ channel)
to confer voltage-dependent gating (21). This
finding implied that the voltage sensor might
be an almost-independent domain, because if it
had to form a large interface through helix
packing with the pore, the chimera would
likely not function.
The first atomic structures of a prokaryotic
Kv channel (KvAP) also implied that the
voltage sensors are loosely attached to the pore
(22). One of these EProtein Data Bank (PDB)
ID 1ORS^ was of an isolated voltage-sensor
domain, which surprisingly could be expressed
in the membrane by itself (without the pore).
Another, which is a full-length channel struc-
ture (PDB ID 1ORQ), showed the voltage-
