ABSTRACT
As part of an effort to develop stable and replicable
unnatural base pairs, we have evaluated a large
number of unnatural nucleotides with predominantly
hydrophobic nucleobases. Despite its limited aro-
matic surface area, a nucleobase analog scaffold
that has emerged as being especially promising is
the simple phenyl ring. Modifications of this scaffold
with methyl and fluoro groups have been shown to
impact base pair stability and polymerase recogni-
tion, suggesting that nucleobase shape, hydrophobi-
city and electrostatics are important. To further
explore the impact of heteroatom substitution within
this nucleobase scaffold, we report the synthesis,
stability and polymerase recognition of nucleoside
analogs bearing single bromo- or cyano-derivatized
phenyl rings. Both modifications are found to gener-
ally stabilize base pair formation to a greater extent
than methyl or fluoro substitution. Moreover, poly-
merase recognition of the unnatural base pairs is
found to be very sensitive to both the position and
nature of the heteroatom substituent. The results
help identify the determinants of base pair stability
and efficient replication and should contribute to
the effort to develop stable and replicable unnatural
base pairs.
INTRODUCTION
With the determination of the structure of the DNA double
helix in 1953, it was assumed that the complementary
hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) of the natural nucleobases
was the origin of selective duplex stability and replication.
However, with the discovery that DNA replication does not
absolutely require H-bond complementarity (1–4), it became
apparent that this model is at least incomplete. The ability to
use forces other than H-bonding to control the selective pairing
of nucleobases during replication dramatically increases the
range of possible unnatural base pairs. Such unnatural base
pairs would have immediate biotechnology applications (5)
and would also facilitate the longer term goal of expanding the
genetic code (6,7). Toward the goal of developing unnatural
base pairs, we have synthesized and characterized a large
number of nucleotides bearing large and predominantly hydro-
phobic nucleobases, based on the isocarbostyril, napthyl and
indole scaffolds, whose pairing should be mediated by hydro-
phobic interactions (Figure 1) (8–16). (Although many of the
unnatural nucleobases are not actually basic, we refer to them
as nucleobase analogs for simplicity.) We have systematically
evaluated the stability of the resulting base pairs as well as
analogs whose shape and electrostatic properties have been
altered by methyl group and heteroatom substitution
(11,15,17,18). From these studies, we have identified several
self pairs (formed by pairing of identical analogs) and hetero-
pairs (formed by pairing two different analogs) that rival
natural base pairs in terms of thermal stability and selectivity
against mispairing, despite not being able to form interbase
H-bonds.
In addition to stable and selective pairing in duplex DNA,
candidate unnatural base pairs must also be efficiently and
selectively replicated by DNA polymerases. We have reported
the kinetic analysis of how each of the nucleobases are recog-
nized by the exonuclease deficient DNA polymerase I from
Escherichia coli (Kf) and identified several self pairs and
heteropairs that are efficiently synthesized (i.e. by insertion
of the unnatural triphosphate opposite its cognate base in the
template) (8–11,13,15–18). However, both selectivity against
insertion of the natural triphosphates and unnatural base pair
extension (i.e. continued elongation of the newly synthesized
primer terminus) remained challenging. While large aromatic
surface area increases the stability of the unnatural base pairs,
it may also compromise synthesis fidelity and extension. This
hypothesis is based on structural work suggesting that in
duplex DNA, pairs formed between analogs with extended
aromatic surface area interact via face-packing, where one
analog intercalates into the opposite strand between its pairing
nucleobase and an adjacent nucleobase (19,20). Such an inter-
action may not be optimal for discrimination against the

natural nucleobases during base pair synthesis, nor at the pri-
mer terminus where it may result in a structure that is not
optimal for continued primer extension.
We thus became interested in examining nucleobase ana-
logs that lack extended aromatic surface area but are optimized
to interact edge-on in a fashion analogous to a natural Watson–
Crick base pair. Surprisingly, with suitably chosen substitu-
ents, we have found that nucleotides bearing simple phenyl
rings may form stable and selective pairs in duplex DNA and
are also synthesized with reasonable efficiency and fidelity,
despite having no H-bonding functionality and relatively little
aromatic surface area. In addition, once synthesized at a
primer terminus, several of the pairs are extended by Kf
with efficiencies significantly greater than the pairs formed
between the larger nucleobases. For example, the 3FB,
DM5 and TM self pairs (Figure 1), identified during a sys-
tematic analysis of methyl and fluoro-derivatized phenyl ring
nucleobase scaffolds are both synthesized and extended with
reasonable efficiency by Kf [S. Matsuda and F. E. Romesberg,
manuscript accepted; (18,21)]. These self pairs presumably
interact in an edge-on manner and their more efficient exten-
sion suggests that the resulting interbase interface provides a
primer terminus structure that is better recognized by DNA
polymerases. However, discrimination against dATP and fur-
ther optimization of the extension rates remain important for
the development of these unnatural base pairs. Because
adenine is the most hydrophobic of the natural nucleobases
and the heteroatom-derivatized 3FB self pair is extended about
an order of magnitude more efficiently than either DM5 or
TM, we became interested further examining nucleobase
hydrophobicity, dipole moment and polarizability.
To further explore base pair stability, discrimination against
the natural dNTPs, and extension as a function of heteroatom
substitution, we now report the synthesis and initial char-
acterization of two series of nucleotide analogs bearing dif-
ferent heteroatom substituents. Like 3FB, DM5 and TM, these
C-glycosides bear simple phenyl nucleobase analogs, but are
derivatized with all possible single bromo or cyano substitu-
tions. The substituents were designed to vary the size, dipole
moment and polarizability of the nucleobase and for compar-
ison with the analogous fluoro- and methyl-derivatized ana-
logs. The data reveal that base pair stability and extension are
sensitive to both the nature and the position of heteroatom
substitution. When combined with the previous studies,
these results suggest that the 3FB self pair is efficiently exten-
ded due to a combination of steric and electrostatic effects, and
that it might be optimized by modification at the 2- and/or
4-positions. These results should be useful for designing
nucleobase analogs with a wide range of biotechnology
applications as well as analogs with which to expand the
genetic alphabet.

at 260 nm from 20 to 80C at a heating rate of 0.5C per min,
using a Cary 300 Bio UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Melting
temperatures were determined from the derivative method
using the Cary Win UV thermal application software.
Steady-state kinetics
The unnatural nucleobases were evaluated as substrates for
Kf by measuring initial rates at which a [g-33P]-labeled primer,
d(TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAX) annealed to the
45mer template, d(CGCTAGGACGGCATTGGATCGYTCT-
CCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA), was extended with varying
concentrations of natural or unnatural nucleoside triphosphates.
Each reaction included 40 nM primer-templates, 0.3–1.2 nM
enzyme, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT
and 50 mg/ml acetylated BSA. The reactions were initiated by
adding a 5 ml 2· dNTP solution to a 5 ml solution containing the
polymerase and primer-template and incubating at 25C for
5–12 min, and were then quenched with the addition of
20 ml of loading dye (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA and
sufficient amounts of bromophenol blue and xylene cyanole).
The reactions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis and a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) was
used to quantify gel band intensities corresponding to the
extended and unextended primer. The measured velocities
were plotted against the concentration of dNTP and fit to the
Michaelis–Menten equation to determine Vmax and KM. kcat was
determined from Vmax by normalizing by the total enzyme
concentration.
RESULTS
Design and synthesis of nucleobase analogs
To more systematically probe the contribution of hydrophobi-
city and electrostatics to the properties of the unnatural base
pairs, we extended our studies of methyl and fluoro substi-
tuents to include bromo and cyano substituents (Figure 1).
The benzene, toluene, fluorobenzene, bromobenzene and
benzonitrile nucleobase analogs differ in terms of size, hydro-
phobicity, dipole moment and polarizability. The
hydrophobicity of the nucleobase moieties increases in the
order benzonitrile < benzene < fluorobenzene < toluene <
bromobenzene (22,23); while the dipole moment and polar-
izability increase approximately in the order, benzene < tolu-
ene < bromobenzene < fluorobenzene < benzonitrile (24,25).
The parental benzene scaffold is the smallest nucleobase ana-
log, followed by fluorobenzene and bromobenzene, with tolu-
ene and benzonitrile being the largest. The varying
contributions of nucleobase size, hydrophobicity, dipole
moment and polarizability may thus be examined by compar-
ing the stabilities and polymerase recognition of the different
base pairs.
The bromo- and cyano-derivatized nucleotide analogs were
synthesized as shown in Schemes 1 and 2. Briefly, tetraiso-
propyl disiloxane-protected nucleosides were synthesized by
aryllithium coupling to the disiloxane-protected lactone, based
on modified literature procedures (26,27). In the case of the
1,2-dibromobenzene analog, the reaction was carried out in
a mixture of diethyl ether and THF at 110C, above this
temperature 1,2-bromophenyllithium elimination led to the
formation of benzyne (28). Treatment with triethylsilane
and strong Lewis acid resulted in reduction to give the pro-
tected aryl C-nucleoside in moderate yield. The b-anomer was
the major product (26,27) which was purified from the a-
anomer by flash column chromatography. Deprotection was
achieved by treatment with n-TBAF. Cyano-derivatized
analogs analogues 1d–f were synthesized from 1a–c using
Pd-catalyzed cyanation of the aryl bromide (Scheme 2) (29).
The assignment of b-stereochemistry at C10 for all nucleosides
was based on COSY and 1-D NOE experiments. The phos-
phoramidites for solid-phase DNA synthesis were obtained by
standard dimethoxytritylation and phosphitylation.

natural nucleosides were incorporated into the complementary
oligonucleotides d(GCGTACXCATGCG) and d(CGCAT-
GYGTACGC) at the positions labeled X and Y. These oligo-
nucleotides were chosen in order to examine the effect of
sequence context by comparing the effects of flanking pyri-
midines (position X) and flanking purines (position Y). The
unnatural nucleotides were examined both as self pairs (X ¼
Y) and as heteropairs (X 6¼ Y). The melting temperature (Tm)
of each duplex was determined by thermal denaturation
experiments (Table 1) and used as a measure of base pair
stability. For comparison, the Tm for a duplex containing a
natural base pair (X:Y ¼ dA:dT) is 59.2C.
Generally, the unnatural base pairs are surprisingly stable,
showing Tm values that are only 3 to 6
C less stable than a
dA:dT pair in the same sequence context, and significantly
more stable than a typical mispair between two natural nuc-
leotides (Table 1). However, as with other similarly substi-
tuted analogs, the Tm values show only a modest dependence
on the specific substitution pattern of the nucleobase analog,
with all self pairs and heteropairs showing Tm values between
53.0 and 56.0C. The most stable pairs identified were the 2Br
self pair and the 2CN:2Br and 4CN:3Br heteropairs. Perhaps
the pairs formed between 2-substituted analogs are stable due
to efficient packing in the minor groove, while the 2C
decrease in stability of the 2CN self pair suggests that two
larger cyano groups are not well accommodated.
Generally, the stability of the unnatural base pairs show
little dependence on sequence context, with similar stabilities
regardless of being flanked by purines or pyrimidines. The
most notable exception was the pair formed between 4CN
and 3Br. When 3Br is flanked by purines, it is one of the most
stable base pair of the series (Tm ¼ 56C), but when flanked by
pyrimidines it is one of the least stable (Tm ¼ 53.1C). This
suggests that the polarizable bromine at the 3-position is well
oriented to interact favorably with the aromatic surface area of
the purine, but not pyrimidine nucleobases.
To examine the thermal orthogonality of the unnatural base
pairs, we determined the duplex melting temperatures with the
unnatural bases incorporated at position X and the natural
nucleotides incorporated at position Y (Table 1). All of the
mispairs are significantly less stable than even the least stable
unnatural pair. This demonstrates that despite the only modest
ability of these small nucleobase analogs to differentiate
amongst themselves, they differentiate strongly between the
hydrophobic nucleobases and the natural nucleobases. This

likely results, at least in part, from the forced desolvation of the
more hydrophilic natural bases.
The stabilities of the mispairs are also dependent on the
specific substitution pattern of the unnatural nucleotide. The
stabilities of the mispairs formed with the 4-substituted deriv-
atives are the least sensitive to the specific natural nucleotide,
ranging by only 1–2C. The 2- and 3-substituted analogs show
greater discrimination, with the purine mispairs being the most
stable, followed by the mispair with dT, and finally by the
mispair with dC, which is 1 to 5C less stable than the other
mispairs. The discrimination is greatest with the 2-substituted
analogs, where mispair stability ranged over 5C. While the
stabilities generally parallel the hydrophobicity of the natural
nucleobases, they also reflect the aromatic surface area of the
natural base. In addition, the greater discrimination of 2Br and
2CN suggests that a substituent at the 2-position locks the
nucleobase analog into an anti-orientation, which forces the
substituent into the interbase interface, while the other analogs
are free to rotate about the C-glycosidic bond and present the
unsubstituted side of the phenyl ring to the pairing base. Non-
etheless, mispairs with the natural nucleotides are significantly
less stable than the unnatural pairs in all cases, demonstrating
the thermal orthogonality inherent to even small hydrophobic
nucleobases, as has been seen with other predominantly hydro-
phobic analogs (18,21).
Polymerase-mediated mispair synthesis
The nucleotides of any unnatural base pair must be not only
thermally orthogonal, but also kinetically orthogonal. To char-
acterize the kinetic discrimination against mispairing, we
incorporated the unnatural analogs into template DNA and
examined their ability to direct Kf to incorporate the natural
dNTPs. In each case, we characterized the binding of the
natural dNTP (KM) and the turnover of the resulting ternary
complex (kcat). The ratio, kcat/KM, is the second order rate
constant, and is a measure of catalytic efficiency. Generally,
as has been observed with other predominantly hydrophobic
nucleobases, dATP is inserted most efficiently opposite the
analog in the template. However, the efficiency of dATP inser-
tion is significantly less than that observed with other
analogs, ranging from 7.8 · 103 M1min1 (for 2Br) to
8.8 · 104 M1min1 (for 2CN). The analogs that have
bromo or cyano groups at either the 3- or 4-position template
dATP insertion with a second order rate constant that varies
only between 2 · 104 and 4 · 104 M1min1, while the same
substituents at the 2-position have a more variable effect
(Table 2).
None of the other natural dNTPs are inserted with more than
moderate efficiencies, but the analogs do show interesting
differences in discrimination. 2Br templates the addition of
dGTP, dTTP and dCTP relatively efficiently, with second
order rate constants within 3-fold of that for dATP insertion.
However, 2CN directs the insertion of dGTP 7-fold less effi-
ciently than dATP, dTTP an order of magnitude less efficiently
than dGTP, and does not direct the insertion of dCTP at all.
3Br does not direct Kf to insert any of the natural dNTPs with
detectable efficiencies, while a cyano group at the same posi-
tion results in an analog that templates dTTP insertion with
modest efficiency, and to an even lesser extent dCTP, but not
dGTP. 4Br templates the insertion of the pyrimidine triphos-
phates with modest efficiencies of 3 · 104 M1min1, but
not dGTP at a detectable rate, and the analog with a cyano
group at the same position does not direct the insertion of any
of the three other dNTPs at detectable rates.
Recognition of unnatural base pairs at a primer terminus
by Kf DNA polymerase
To determine how bromo- and cyano-modifications impact
unnatural base pair recognition by a DNA polymerase, we
examined the efficiencies with which Kf extended primers
that terminated with the unnatural base pairs (X:Y, where
X is in the primer and Y is in the template) by incorporation
of the next correct triphosphate, dCTP (Table 3). Thirty one of
the thirty six unnatural base pairs are not extended with rates
that are sufficient to detect (<103 M1min1). Of the five that
were extended, three have 2CN in the template strand, paired
opposite either 4Br, 4CN or 3CN in the primer strand. The
4Br:2CN heteropair is most efficiently extended with a second
order rate constant of 3.0 · 104 M1min1. The 4CN:2CN and
3CN:2CN pairs are extended slightly less efficiently, with
virtually identical rate constants of 8.0 · 103 M1min1.
The difference between extension rates results from a larger

kcat for 4Br:2CN, relative to the pairs formed with 4CN or
3CN. The position of the bromo substituent of 4Br:2CN
is apparently critical, since moving it to either the 3- or
2-position results in a pair whose extension is too slow to
detect. However, the virtually identical kcat’s and KM’s asso-
ciated with extension of the 4CN:2CN and 3CN:2CN pairs
suggest that the precise position of the cyano group at the
primer terminus is less critical. However, moving the cyano
group to the 2-position of the analog is not tolerated at the
primer terminus, as Kf extends the 2CN self pair with a rate
that is too low to detect. Extension is more specific for the
cyano group at the 2-position of the analog in the template,
moving it to either the 3- or 4-position results in a pair whose
extension could not be detected.
The remaining two unnatural base pairs that are extended
with detectable rates also contained 2CN, but in these cases
2CN was located at the primer strand, paired opposite either
4Br or 2Br in the template strand. These termini were exten-
ded with second order rate constants of 3.8 · 103 M1min1
and 1.0 · 103 M1min1, respectively. The 2CN:4Br pair is
extended less efficiently than the three pairs with 2CN in the
template due a reduced kcat, while the 2CN:2Br pair is exten-
ded less efficiently due to both a reduced kcat and an increased
KM. Moving the substituent of either the analog in the template
or the primer resulted in loss of detectable polymerase recog-
nition. Again, the pairs in the other strand context were
extended with very different rates. 4Br:2CN was extended
significantly faster than 2CN:4Br and 2Br:2CN was not
extended with a rate sufficient for characterization. In all,
these results demonstrate that extension efficiency depends
on both the specific substitution pattern of the nucleobase
analog and the sequence context.
DISCUSSION
We (8–11,13,15–18) and others (30,31) have developed a wide
variety of nucleotides that pair predominantly via hydrophobic
packing. These, and other studies (1–4,32–35), have helped
deconvolute the varying contributions of nucleobase shape,
hydrophobicity and electrostatics to stability and polymerase-
mediated replication. To further explore the determinants of
base pair stability and replication, we examined nucleobase
analogs bearing simple phenyl rings that are modified with
bromo and cyano substituents. Characterizing the substituent
effects is facilitated by comparing the data with that previously
reported for BEN, the parental nucleoside possessing an
unsubstituted phenyl ring, as well as for the analogs similarly
derivatized with methyl and fluoro substituents [S. Matsuda
and F. E. Romesberg, manuscript submitted; (18)] (Figure 1).
(Note that the 4-fluoro analog has not been characterized.)
Thermodynamic and kinetic orthogonality
While hydrophobic nucleobase analogs are generally thermo-
dynamically orthogonal, stable mispairs are often formed with
dA, and kinetic orthogonality is consistently limited by the
facile insertion of dATP opposite the analogs in the template.
Thus, it is important that the determinants of mispair stability
and synthesis be understood, especially relative to adenine.
Mispair stability. Generally, at the 2-position, fluoro and
bromo substitution had larger effects than cyano or methyl
group substitution. The presence of a halogen at the 2-position
stabilizes the mispairs by 1.0 to 2.8C, with the exception of
the 2FB:dG mispair, which is destabilized by 3.1C, relative to
the BEN:dG mispair. It is unclear why the two halogens have
such large and opposite effects on the mispair with dG, while
cyano or methyl group substitution has little effect.
At the 3- and 4-positions, bromo and cyano substituents
stabilize each of the mispairs, which is in contrast to the effects
observed with fluoro and methyl group modification, which
are generally small. The nonspecific stabilization of all mis-
pairs by the addition of a bromo or cyano substituent at these
positions suggests that the stabilization results from either an
increased dipole moment or increased polarizability. How-
ever, it is again interesting to note that, while methyl substi-
tution at the 3-position has little effect, fluoro and bromo

substitution at the 3-position have opposite effects on the
stability of the mispair with dG; 3Br:dG is stabilized and
3FB:dG is destabilized, relative to BEN:dG.
Mispair synthesis. Kinetic discrimination against the natural
dNTPs is important for any candidate unnatural base pair. In
the template, BEN is selective for dATP insertion. The effi-
ciency results from a large kcat, which is only 8-fold smaller
than that for the synthesis of a natural base pair in the same
sequence context. Relative to BEN, the addition of a bromo or
cyano group consistently results in a decreased rate of inser-
tion for each dNTP. The only exceptions are the insertion of
dCTP opposite 4Br, which was 2.6-fold faster than opposite
BEN, and dGTP opposite 2CN, which was 7-fold faster than
opposite BEN. The decrease in dNTP insertion efficiency
opposite the bromo- and cyano-derivatized analogs results
predominantly from decreased kcat values, which is most pro-
nounced for dATP insertion opposite the analogs modified at
the 2-position. The increased discrimination against dATP
insertion with bromo or cyano modification at the 2-position
is particularly notable, as modification at this position with
either a fluoro or methyl group has little or the opposite effect,
respectively. While it is often difficult to interpret steady-state
kinetic data in terms of mechanism, this data suggests that the
fluorine atom may be too small to have a significant effect in
the developing transition state, while packing interactions
mediated by the 2-methyl group stabilize the transition
state, and electrostatic interactions mediated by the bromine
atom or cyano group destabilize it. Regardless of its origins,
the increased discrimination of 2Br and 2CN against dATP
should be useful for the further development of more ortho-
gonal analogs, as fidelity with respect to dATP insertion typ-
ically limits unnatural base pair synthesis fidelity.
Unnatural base pair stability and extension
In addition to being efficiently and selectively synthesized, an
unnatural base pair must also be stable in duplex DNA and
efficiently recognized when at the primer terminus so that
efficient DNA synthesis may continue. The results of this
study demonstrate that bromo and cyano substituents have
significant effects on both base pair stability and extension
that are again different from those that result from methyl or
fluoro group modifications at analogous positions.
Stability of the unnatural base pairs. The stabilities of the
bromo- and cyano-derivatized unnatural base pairs vary
between 53 and 56C. These pairs are significantly more stable
than any mispair with a natural nucleotide, the greatest sta-
bility of which is 51C. The most stable pairs were the 2Br self
pair and the 2Br:2CN and 3Br:4CN heteropairs. In each case,
the bromine is positioned to pack on adjacent purines, where
its polarizability may contribute to stable packing interactions.
Despite the absence of H-bond donors/acceptors and signific-
antly reduced aromatic surface area, these unnatural base pairs
are only 3.2C less stable than a natural dA:dT pair in the same
sequence context. Moreover, this stability is2C greater than
any pair formed between analogs bearing a single methyl
group or fluorine atom. The data suggest that increased
size, dipole moment and polarizability may all contribute to
base pair stability.
Kf-mediated extension of the unnatural base pairs. The rep-
lication of DNA containing unnatural base pairs is consistently
limited by slow primer extension after incorporation of the
unnatural nucleotide. For reference, Kf extends the BEN self
pair by insertion of dCTP opposite dG with a kcat/KM of only
1.6 · 103 M1min1. Generally, base pairs formed between
the bromo- and cyano-derivatives are not extended more effi-
ciently. However, the pairs composed of an analog with a
cyano group at the 2-position, especially in the template,
are extended significantly more efficiently than BEN. The
most efficiently extended pair, 4Br:2CN, is extended by Kf
with a second order rate constant of 3.0 · 104 M1min1,
which is significantly more efficient than any pair formed
between analogs with single methyl group substituents and
only an order of magnitude less efficient than 3FB self pair
extension. Perhaps the increased efficiency of the base pairs
with 2CN in the template at the primer terminus reflects the at
least marginal ability of the cyano group to accept a H-bond
from the polymerase, as is thought to be important for the
extension of a natural base pair (36,37). No analogs with a
bromo or cyano group at the 3-position of the ring form pairs
that are extended with detectable efficiency. Previous studies
of methyl-derivatized analogs suggested that bulky substitu-
ents at the 3-position introduce eclipsing interactions within
the interbase interface and result in a primer terminus structure
that is not well recognized by the polymerase. However, as
already mentioned, inclusion of fluorine at the 3-position res-
ults in a self pair that is relatively efficiently extended by Kf.
Perhaps the smaller fluorine substituents are more optimal for
interbase packing, while methyl, bromo and cyano substituents
are too bulky. However, preliminary structural data suggests
that the 3FB self pair is dynamic, with each nucleobase adopt-
ing multiple conformations in duplex DNA, allowing for the
possibility that a minor conformer might be efficiently exten-
ded, perhaps one with appropriately oriented dipoles or other
electrostatic or packing interactions. Such electrostatic inter-
actions may not be present with methyl substituents, and the
size of the methyl, bromo and cyano substituents may disfavor
the conformation required for extension.
Progress toward the expansion of the genetic alphabet
Efforts to develop hydrophobic base pairs were originally
focused on nucleotides with nucleobase analogs that had
extended aromatic surface area. However, these analogs are
now thought to interact via face-packing, which may result in
poor discrimination against the adenine nucleobase as well as a
primer terminus geometry that is not well recognized by DNA
polymerases. To circumvent this problem, we have turned our
attention to nucleotides bearing smaller nucleobase analogs
that should pack edge-on, in a manner topologically similar to
a natural base pair, and thus might discriminate more strongly
against adenine and form more natural-like primer termini.
In this study, bromo and cyano substitution of the small
phenyl ring nucleobase scaffold was seen to have large effects
on unnatural base pair and mispair stability. In fact, these
substituents are significantly more stabilizing than either
methyl or fluoro groups, suggesting that large dipole moments
and polarizability are generally important. Thus, these modi-
fications, especially bromo-substitution at the 2- and
3-positions, may be a generally useful tool for stabilizing

unnatural base pairs. This is particularly interesting from the
perspective of expanding the genetic alphabet considering that
these modifications also dramatically increase kinetic discrim-
ination against dATP. In addition, several of the unnatural base
pairs examined are extended more efficiently than the others,
suggesting that their electrostatic properties may also be
optimized for this critical step of replication. While the
most efficiently extended pair, 4Br:2CN, is still extended
10-fold less efficiently than the 3FB self pair, the data non-
etheless suggest that fluorine is not absolutely unique in its
ability to facilitate extension.
A particularly exciting conclusion of these studies is that, if
the various substituents act independently, it should be pos-
sible to use multiple substituents to further improve stability
and replication. For example, analogs bearing 2- or 4-bromo
and cyano substituents, in addition to a 3-fluoro substituent and
perhaps a methyl group, might retain the kinetic orthogonality
observed with the analogs characterized in this study, but like
3FB, might also be more efficiently extended. Such analogs
are currently being synthesized.
