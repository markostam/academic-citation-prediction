ABSTRACT
Dot1 is a conserved histone methyltransferase that
methylates histone H3 on lysine 79. We previously
observed that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single
DOT1 gene encodes two Dot1 protein species. Here,
we show that the relative abundance of the two
isoforms changed under nutrient-limiting con-
ditions. A mutagenesis approach showed that the
two Dot1 isoforms are produced from two alterna-
tive translation start sites as a result of leaky
scanning by the ribosome. The leaky scanning was
not affected by the 50- or 30-untranslated regions of
DOT1, indicating that translation initiation is deter-
mined by the DOT1 coding sequence. Construction
of yeast strains expressing either one of the
isoforms showed that both were sufficient for
Dot1’s role in global H3K79 methylation and
telomeric gene silencing. However, the absence of
the long isoform of Dot1 altered the resistance of
yeast cells to the chitin-binding drug Calcofluor
White, suggesting that the two Dot1 isoforms have
a differential function in cell wall biogenesis.
INTRODUCTION
Dot1 is a histone methyltransferase that was originally
identiﬁed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme,
which is conserved from yeast to humans, catalyzes
mono-, di- and trimethylation of lysine 79 on histone H3
(H3K79), a residue located on the nucleosome core (1–4).
In yeast, Dot1 methylates 90% of histone H3 and is
involved in gene silencing, activation of the DNA
damage response and the pachytene checkpoint in
meiosis (1,5–7). In addition, genetic interactions have
been reported between DOT1 and diﬀerent genes
involved in cell wall biogenesis, suggesting a function for
Dot1 in this process (8,9). In mammals, Dot1 plays a role
in Ras-induced gene silencing and aldosterone-induced
gene repression as well as in inappropriate gene activation
in certain types of leukemia (10–13).
Our antibodies directed against yeast Dot1 detect two
protein species on immunoblots, even though the protein
is encoded by a single gene (1). Several mechanisms
can result in the formation of two diﬀerent protein
species from one gene. First, full-length proteins can be
processed by proteases, resulting in the generation of N-
or C-terminally truncated forms. Second, several
posttranslational modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation
or ubiquitination can result in an altered mobility of
proteins on immunoblots. Finally, diﬀerent protein
isoforms can be generated by alternative translation,
which can be caused by variations in the mRNA
sequence (for example due to alternative mRNA splicing
or alternative transcription start site selection) or by the
usage of multiple translation start sites. Translation from
multiple start codons can occur when the mRNA contains
an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), or when the
ribosome scanning over the mRNA molecule skips the
ﬁrst start codon and subsequently initiates translation
from a downstream alternative start codon, a phenome-
non called ‘leaky scanning’ (14). Alternatively, the
ribosome can bind to the mRNA on the 50-side of the
start codon via the normal mechanism, but then jumps
over the ﬁrst start codon to initiate transcription from
a downstream start codon, a process called ribosome
shunting (15). Translation start site selection is a highly
regulated process that is critical for diﬀerential gene reg-
ulation in eukaryotes (16). Mutations that aﬀect transla-
tion initiation have been associated with a range of genetic
diseases in humans (17). However, there are still many
open questions regarding the molecular mechanisms of
start codon selection (18).
In this study, we determined the mechanism by which
the two Dot1 isoforms are generated. We show by protein
tagging, protein truncation and mutational analysis that
they are the result of leaky scanning by the ribosome. This
enabled the construction of yeast strains expressing either
one of the isoforms. The two Dot1 isoforms were found to
have indistinguishable functions in global methylation and

gene silencing. However, they showed distinct functions in
resistance to the chitin-binding molecule Calcoﬂuor White
(CFW), suggesting that they play diﬀerent roles in cell wall
biogenesis. Our results suggest that leaky scanning of
the DOT1 mRNA is aﬀected by sequences downstream
of the start codon, whereas the eﬃciency of translation
initiation is usually thought to depend mainly on the
50-context of the start codon (14). The discovery of uncon-
ventional leaky scanning events like the one reported here
will be instrumental to unravel the complex mechanisms
that regulate translation initiation in yeast and higher
eukaryotes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Yeast strains, plasmids and media
Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in
Table 1. Yeast media were described previously (1).
Silencing assays were performed using media containing
1 g/l 5-ﬂuoroorotic acid (FOA) (Toronto Research
Chemicals). CFW sensitivity of cells was tested using
YEP media containing 20 mg/ml CFW (Sigma).
Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the media at a con-
centration of 50 mg/ml to inhibit protein synthesis.
NKI3031 was derived from a cross between BY4740 and
BY4742 (19). NKI3049 and NKI3066 were derived from
NKI3031 by integration of the GAL1 promoter in front of
the DOT1 gene using plasmid pYM-N22 and PCR-
mediated gene replacement (20); in NKI3049 the GAL1
promoter was integrated such that 62 bp of the
endogenous DOT1 50-untranslated region was maintained,
whereas in NKI3066 the endogenous DOT1 50-UTR was
replaced by GAL1 and vector sequence present in
pYM-N22. NKI1060 was constructed from UCC7164
using PCR-mediated gene replacement and plasmid
pFA6a-KanMX-PGAL1-3HA (21). The single-copy
pLEU2-DOT1 vector (pDOT1) and the multi-copy
GAL1-promoter pTRP1-DOT1 plasmid (pFvL18) were
described previously (1). Mutations in the DOT1 gene in
these plasmids were introduced by Quikchange
(Stratagene) or a three-step PCR protocol and veriﬁed
by sequencing. Details of the mutant DOT1 genes are
shown in Figure 2A. pFvL201 was generated by replacing
the ﬁrst methionine of DOT1 in pDOT1 by a single FLAG
tag followed by a SGGSGG spacer. pFvL212 was derived
from pRS314-DOT1 (single-copy pTRP1-DOT1) by inte-
gration of a GSGGSGGS spacer, single HA TAG and
TAP tag behind the DOT1 gene; the TAP tag sequence
was ampliﬁed from pBS1479 (22). pFvL215 was generated
by deletion of amino acids 4–20 from pFvL212 by gap-
repair. pFvL221 was generated from pFvL18 by integra-
tion of a GSGGSGGS linker behind the DOT1 gene.
pTW055 was derived from pFvL221 by insertion of the
yeast-enhanced citrine tag from plasmid pKT211 (23)
behind the linker using an AatII-AscI digest. Mutations
in pTW055 were generated by integrating the SalI-
EcoRI fragment from pGH03 and pGH04 in SalI-EcoRI
digested pTW055 to generate pGH024 and pGH025,
respectively.
UV irradiation
Exponentially growing cells (OD660 0.5) were arrested in
G1/S with 5 mg/ml a-factor for 2 h, spun, resuspended
in fresh media containing a-factor and plated on 14 cm
Petri dishes. The plates were irradiated with 100 J/m2
UV light of 254 nm using a Stratalinker (Stratagene).
Trichloroacetic acid protein extracts (24) were prepared
30min after irradiation and compared with non-irradiated
controls.
Immunoblots
Whole-cell extracts were obtained from 5 107 cells by
the classical glass beads breakage method using 200 ml of
glass beads and SUMEB lysis buﬀer (25) complemented
with PMSF (1mM), benzamidine (5mM), pepstatin (1 mg/
ml), leupeptin (1 mg/ml) and DTT (1mM). Primary
antibody incubations were performed overnight in Tris-
buﬀered salineTween with 2% dry milk. The rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against Dot1 (1) and H3K79me1,
-me2 and -me3 (26) were described earlier. Commercially
available antibodies that were used in this study are H3
(ab1791, Abcam), Pgk1 (A-6457, Invitrogen) and Rad53
(sc-6749, Santa Cruz).
RNA structure prediction
The Vienna RNAfold web server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac
.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi) was used to predict secondary
RNA structures and the eﬀect of mutations in the DOT1
RNA sequence (27). Analysis of diﬀerent sized fragments
from the DOT1 region –10 to + 200 revealed a common
predicted structure of the 50-part of the DOT1 mRNA
(–10 to +65).
Confocal microscopy
Log phase cells were ﬁxed for 10min in 4% formaldehyde
in PBS, after which they were incubated with Hoechst
33342 (Invitrogen, 1 mg/ml) for 15min to stain the
nucleus. Cell wall staining was performed by incubation
of the cells with ConA-Cy5 for 15min. Cells were
mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories). Samples were analyzed with a confocal
laser scanning microscope (AOBS, Leica) equipped with
a HCX PL APO lbd.bl 63/NA 1.4 oil corrected objective
lens (Leica). The acquisition software used was Leica LCS.
Cells were imaged using a 405 nm, a 516 nm and a 633 nm
laser to visualize Hoechst, Citrine and Cy5, respectively.
Electron microscopy
Log phase cells were ﬁxed in Karnovsky ﬁxative contain-
ing 0.15% Ruthenium Red (BDH chemical) for 5min at
room temperature, for marking the outer membranes of
the cells. After washing with 0.1M cacodylate buﬀer pH
7.2 the cells were postﬁxed with 1% osmiumtetroxide,
en-block stained with 0.5% uranylacetate (Ultrastain 1,
Leica) followed by dehydration series and embedding in
EMBed 812 (Aurion). The sections were examined using a
CM10 microscope (FEI).

RESULTS
Two isoforms of Dot1 in S. cerevisiae
An antibody directed against the C-terminal part of the
yeast Dot1 protein (Figure 1A) recognizes two discrete
proteins on immunoblots (Figure 1B). The slow-migrating
protein is usually more abundant than the fast-migrating
protein. The goal of this study was to determine the
identity, regulation and the function of the two protein
isoforms of Dot1. Since Dot1 is involved in activation of
the DNA damage checkpoint upon exposure to UV light
(6), we tested whether the relative abundance of the
two proteins was aﬀected by DNA damage. Thirty
minutes after UV irradiation, there was no detectable
diﬀerence in relative abundance of the two isoforms,
while phosphorylation of the central checkpoint kinase
Rad53 conﬁrmed activation of the DNA damage check-
point (Figure 1C). To investigate whether the production
of the two isoforms was regulated by growth conditions,
exponentially growing cells were compared with cells
arrested by nutrient depletion. After starving the cells
for two days, the abundance of the slow-migrating Dot1
protein was reduced while the fast-migrating protein was
unaﬀected (Figure 1D). This change in the ratio of the
Dot1 isoforms probably does not reﬂect a diﬀerence in
protein stability, since the two isoforms showed approxi-
mately the same rate of degradation when protein synthe-
sis was blocked by addition of cycloheximide (Figure 1E).

These results show that the relative abundance of the two
Dot1 isoforms is dependent on growth conditions.
A long and a short Dot1 protein
Our aim was to express the two Dot1 isoforms separately
in yeast, to determine whether the existence of the two
isoforms and the diﬀerential expression is relevant for
the function of Dot1. Therefore, ﬁrst the mechanism of
production of the two isoforms was determined. Previous
results had shown that the addition of a single N-terminal
FLAG tag to the Dot1 protein resulted in a shift in
mobility as well as expression of only one Dot1 isoform
[Figure 1F, (26)]. In contrast, introduction of a TAP tag at
the C-terminus of Dot1 (and the concomitant replacement
of the DOT1 30-UTR with that of the ADH1 gene) did not
aﬀect the expression of the two isoforms (Figure 1G).
However, an internal deletion of amino acids 4–20
(Dot14–20) resulted in the expression of only one
Dot1 isoform (Figure 1G). These results indicated that
the protein sequence or the coding sequence of the ﬁrst
20 amino acids was involved in the expression of the two
isoforms. These results also suggested that the production
of two isoforms was not caused by a posttranslational
modiﬁcation of Dot1 because the double band was dis-
rupted by two non-overlapping mutations: N-terminal
tagging (which aﬀects the N-terminal residue of
Dot1; Figure 1F) as well as an internal deletion (which
leaves the ﬁrst three N-terminal residues of Dot1 intact;
Figure 1G).
The Dot14–20 protein migrated at approximately the
same size as the smaller isoform of Dot1 (Figure 1G),
suggesting that the slower migrating Dot1 band might
represent the full-length protein and the fast-migrating
band a Dot1 protein that is missing part of the
N-terminus. A smaller protein can be generated by
Figure 1. Formation of two Dot1 isoforms depends on the N-terminus. (A) Schematic overview of the structure of the yeast Dot1 protein with a
lysine-rich putative nucleosome binding domain, a methyltransferase core and a C-terminal domain that binds to histone H4. The Dot1 antibody is
directed against the very C-terminus of the protein. Numbering of amino acid residues starts at the ﬁrst methionine, a residue that is most likely
absent from the mature protein due to co-translational cleavage. (B) Immunoblot analysis of Dot1 expression shows that two isoforms are present in
log phase cultures. Whole-cell extracts of a dot1D strain (UCC7183) transformed with an empty plasmid (pRS315) or a single copy plasmid
expressing DOT1 (pDOT1) were analyzed. (C) Immunoblot analysis of Dot1 expression in wild-type cells (NKI3031) following UV irradiation of
cells arrested in G1. The mobility shift of Rad53 caused by UV-induced phosphorylation was used to conﬁrm activation of the DNA-damage
checkpoint. Pgk1 was used as a loading control. (D) Whole-cell lysates of wild-type strain NKI3031 were prepared from exponentially growing
cultures and cultures of starved cells grown overnight or over two nights. Dot1 expression was analyzed by immunoblot and Pgk1 was used as a
loading control. (E) To analyze the protein half life of the two Dot1 isoforms, 50 mg/ml cycloheximide was added to a culture of exponentially
growing dot1D cells transformed with a DOT1 overexpression plasmid (UCC7183+pFvL18). At the indicated time points aliquots of the culture
were taken for immunoblot analysis of Dot1 expression. (F) Immunoblot analysis of Dot1 expression in cells expressing full-length Dot1 without or
with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag (UCC7183+pDOT1 or pFvL201). (G) Dot1 expression in cells containing full-length Dot1
(UCC7183+pFvL212) or a deletion mutant of Dot1 (4-20, UCC7183+pFvL215) was analyzed by immunoblot. Both proteins have a
C-terminal TAP tag.

degradation or protein processing of a larger protein or by
alternative translation. Inspection of the coding sequence
of Dot1 showed that it contains a second in frame AUG
codon (AUG17), 16 codons downstream of the ﬁrst AUG
(AUG1) (Figure 2A). Alternative translation initiation at
this second start codon would give rise to a Dot1 protein
16 amino acids shorter than the full-length protein. To
distinguish between protein processing and alternative
translation as the mechanisms responsible for Dot1
isoform production, point mutations were introduced in
the DOT1 gene expressed from a single-copy plasmid. The
wild-type and mutant plasmids were then introduced in
dot1D strains. First two frameshift mutants (FSMs) were
generated by introduction of an extra base between
the ﬁrst and the second AUG (FSM1 and FSM2,
Figure 2A). Both of these insertions result in a stop
codon at amino acid position 10, which prevents the
generation of full-length Dot1. We reasoned that if the
smaller protein is generated by processing of the full-
length protein, the frameshift mutations should destroy
production of both full length and the smaller Dot1
protein. In contrast, if it is generated by alternative trans-
lation, frameshift mutations should not aﬀect production
of the smaller Dot1 isoform. As shown in Figure 2B, when
the FSMs were expressed in yeast, the short isoform was
still present whereas the larger isoform was absent. These
experiments rule out the possibility that the smaller Dot1
protein is a processed form of the full-length protein.
Two Dot1 isoforms as a result of alternative translation
To conﬁrm that the two Dot1 isoforms are generated as
diﬀerent translation products from the two start codons
present in the 50-part of the DOT1 coding sequence the
ﬁrst or the second AUG was mutated. Mutation of AUG1
to ACU, changing the initiator Met codon to a non-
initiator Thr codon (Dot1-M1T) resulted in the expression
of a single protein that had the same size as the small
isoform (Figure 2C), conﬁrming that translation can
initiate at a downstream start codon. Mutation of
AUG17 to UUA, changing the initiator Met codon to
a Leu codon (Dot1-M17L) generated a single protein
Figure 2. The two Dot1 isoforms are generated by leaky scanning by the ribosome, which is not dependent on the 50-context of the start codon. (A)
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the N-terminal part of Dot1. Black boxes show the two potential start codons. The diﬀerent mutants used in
this study are shown underlined. Brieﬂy, in the M1T mutant AUG1 is changed to ACU, in the I7M mutant AUA7 is changed to AUG and in the
M17L mutant AUG17 is changed to UUG. FSM1 has an insertion of an A in codon 9 and FSM2 has an insertion of a C in codon 7. Sequence
details of the FSMs are shown in Table 1. (B) Immunoblot analysis of FSMs of Dot in a dot1D strain (UCC7183) transformed with an empty
plasmid (pRS315), a single copy plasmid expressing DOT1 (pDOT1), or a single copy plasmid expressing one of the two FSMs of DOT1 (pGH18 or
pGH21). Pgk1 was used as a loading control. (C) Immunoblot analysis of Dot1 expression in dot1D cells (UCC7183) containing an empty plasmid,
wild-type Dot1, Dot1-M1T or Dot1-M17L (pRS315, pDOT1, pGH01 and pGH02, respectively), showing that mutation of either of the putative start
codons leads to expression of a single Dot1 isoform. Pgk1 was used as a loading control. (D) Comparison of Dot1 expression in a wild-type strain
(PDOT1-DOT1, UCC7164) and a dot1D strain (UCC7183) containing an empty vector (pTCG) or a plasmid overexpressing DOT1 (and 54 bp of its
50-UTR) from the GAL1 promoter (PGAL1-DOT1, pFvL18). A short and a long exposure of the same blot are shown. (E) Nucleotide sequence
around the DOT1 start codon in strains NKI3049 (endogenous DOT1 50-UTR) and NKI3066 (non-yeast vector 50-UTR). Thirty nucleotides of
50-UTR sequence are shown. In strain NKI3049 (DOT1) 62 bp of endogenous DOT1 50-UTR remains upstream of the ﬁrst start codon; in strain
NKI3066 (vector) the DOT1 50-UTR has been removed by insertion of the GAL1 promoter and 45 bp of vector sequence of the integration construct
pYM-N22. (F) Immunoblot comparison of Dot1 expression in the two strains described in E. (G) Immunoblot analysis of Dot1 expression in a dot1D

with the same size as the large isoform (Figure 2C),
showing that translation starts at AUG1 as well as
AUG17. These results suggest that the two isoforms are
indeed two translation products starting at M1 or M17,
respectively.
Next, the cause of alternative translation was investi-
gated. Two translation products can be generated from
two diﬀerent transcript molecules: one initiated
upstream of the ﬁrst AUG, and one initiated in between
the ﬁrst and second AUG. Alternatively, they can be
generated from a single long transcript by alternative
start codon usage. To distinguish between these two
possibilities, the endogenous DOT1 promoter was
replaced by the GAL1 promoter, which is induced when
cells are grown in media containing galactose. In this
case, 54 bp of the DOT1 50-UTR was retained to avoid
changes in the context of the start codon. When Dot1 was
expressed from the GAL1 promoter, the two isoforms
were generated in the same ratio as found when the
gene was expressed from its endogenous promoter
(Figure 2D). Since it is unlikely that two unrelated
promoters use identical transcription start sites (i.e.
upstream of the ﬁrst AUG and in between the ﬁrst and
second AUG) and with identical relative frequencies,
this result suggests that the two isoforms are not
generated by alternative transcription start site selection.
Alternative translation can be caused by ribosome
shunting, by leaky scanning of the ribosome or by an
IRES. In ribosome shunting, which has mainly been
described for viruses, the ribosome binds to the mRNA
on the 50-side of the start codon via the normal mecha-
nism, but then ‘jumps’ over the ﬁrst start codon to initiate
transcription from a downstream start codon (15). In
leaky scanning, the ribosome does scan over the ﬁrst
start codon but does not recognize it in a signiﬁcant
fraction of initiation events (14). An IRES is an mRNA
sequence that has special structural properties allowing
the recruitment of ribosomes without using the standard
mechanism of translation initiation (28).
To address the mechanism of alternative translation, the
DOT1 promoter and the complete 50-UTR were replaced
by an exogenous GAL1 promoter and 45 bp of non-yeast
vector sequence immediately upstream of the open reading
frame of DOT1 (Figure 2E). As a control, the DOT1
promoter was replaced by the GAL1 promoter cassette
such that 62 bp of the endogenous DOT1 50-UTR was
retained (Figure 2E). When transcription from the GAL1
promoter was induced, the two isoforms were generated in
approximately the same ratio in both strains (Figure 2F),
suggesting that the 50-context of the start codon did not
aﬀect the initiation of translation. Therefore, ribosome
shunting was not a likely cause of the alternative transla-
tion. We note that the overall Dot1 abundance was higher
in the presence of the heterologous 50-UTR (Figure 2F),
indicating that the 50-UTR might aﬀect mRNA stability
or transcription.
Most IRES elements are over 100 bp long, even though
the minimal IRES modules may be shorter (28). The few
bases between the ﬁrst and second start codon of Dot1
seem insuﬃcient to constitute an IRES. Leaky scanning by
the ribosome thus seemed to be the most plausible
explanation for the generation of the two isoforms. To
verify this, a new start codon was inserted in between
AUG1 and AUG17 at position 7 by changing the Ile
codon to an initiator Met codon (I7M, Figure 2A). If an
IRES element was the cause of the alternative translation,
the Dot1-I7M mutation could have two diﬀerent eﬀects.
This mutation might interfere with the activity of the
IRES element, resulting in loss of expression of the
shorter isoform. Alternatively, the mutation could leave
initiation at AUG17 unaﬀected, which would lead to
normal expression of the two isoforms. In contrast, if
leaky scanning was the cause of the alternative translation,
skipping of AUG1 would lead to translation initiation at
the new start codon AUG7 and thereby prevent transla-
tion start at AUG17. When the Dot1-I7M mutant was
expressed two isoforms were produced, but the smaller
one had become slightly larger (Figure 2G). Although
the eﬀect of the 10 amino acid size diﬀerence was small,
we consistently detected a slower migration of the short
isoform in the Dot1-I7M mutant in multiple independent
experiments (data not shown). This result shows that
translation initiated at the new start codon, indicating
that the two isoforms of Dot1 result from leaky
scanning by the ribosome.
More support for this model comes from the Dot1-M1T
and Dot1-M17L mutants in which only one of the
isoforms is expressed. In the wild-type DOT1 transcript
skipping of the ﬁrst AUG occurs in a fraction of the trans-
lation events. However, if the ﬁrst AUG is mutated, every
ribosome will start translation from AUG17, which is
expected to lead to an increase in abundance of the
short Dot1 protein. This is indeed what was observed in
the Dot1-M1T mutant (Figure 2C). This was not the case
in the FSMs, in which AUG1 was still present (Figure 2B).
As expected, in the Dot1-M17L mutant the larger isoform
was expressed at the same level as in wild-type cells,
indicating that mutation of the downstream AUG had
no major eﬀects on translation initiation at AUG1
(Figure 2C). We note that no smaller isoforms of Dot1
are detected in this mutant suggesting that no proteins
were produced by translation initiation at a downstream
start codon such as AUG40.
Mechanism of leaky scanning
Little is known about factors that aﬀect leaky scanning.
The 50-UTR of the DOT1 gene is unlikely to be involved in
determining the eﬃciency of translation initiation because
replacement of the complete DOT1 50-UTR by an exoge-
nous sequence did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the rate of leaky
scanning (Figure 2F). The eﬃciency of translation initia-
tion is thought to be mainly determined by the nucleotide
sequence upstream of the start codon, as a consequence
of the linear scanning of the ribosome along the mRNA
molecule (14). The Kozak consensus sequence deﬁnes the
optimal context for translation initiation in mammals
(29,30), but the requirements in yeast seem less strict
(31,32). Recently, a genome-wide computational study
showed that there is a strong bias in the yeast genome
for an A at position –3 and a C at position +5.
Presence of these residues was also correlated with the

strength of expression (33). According to these obser-
vations AUG1 of the DOT1 gene is not located in an
optimal context, with a G at position 3 and a G at
position +5 (Figure 2E). In contrast, AUG17 does have
an optimal sequence context. To test if the 3 and +5
positions determine the eﬃciency of translation initiation
of AUG1 of DOT1, they were mutated to the optimal A–3
and C+5, both separately and in combination. However,
in these mutants the two Dot1 isoforms were still
produced with approximately the same ratio as in wild-
type cells (Figure 3A), showing that the sub-optimal
proximal context of AUG1 is not the cause of leaky
scanning.
Another possibility is that the structure of the Dot1
RNA molecule aﬀects the eﬃciency of translation initia-
tion. Although this structure has not been experimentally
determined, the RNA fold algorithm (27) predicts that the
region of the mRNA around AUG1 contains a stem loop,
which might somehow impair the binding of initiation
factors or the polymerase complex to this sequence
(Figure 3B). To test this idea, mutations were made that
were predicted to disrupt the overall structure of this part
of the DOT1 mRNA (Figure 3B and C). Although these
mutations slightly increased the expression of Dot1, none
of the mutations aﬀected the rate of leaky scanning
(Figure 3A and D). This mutagenesis study suggests that
ineﬃcient initiation of AUG1 is not caused by sequences
or RNA structures proximal to the initiator codon.
Functions of the two Dot1 isoforms
Having addressed the origin of the two Dot1 isoforms, we
designed yeast strains that express both or either one of
the two isoforms to determine what the function of the
Dot1 N-terminus might be. It has been shown that alter-
native translation in yeast can lead to production of two
protein isoforms with or without N-terminal targeting
sequences, leading to diﬀerences in sub-cellular localiza-
tion (34–36). To visualize the localization of the two
isoforms, plasmids were constructed expressing wild-type
Dot1, Dot1-M1T or Dot1-M17L fused to a citrine ﬂuo-
rescent tag (a variant of YFP, 37). Since endogenous Dot1
expression is very low (7,38), the fusion proteins were
expressed from a GAL1 promoter. In addition, the yeast
cell wall was visualized using ConA-Cy5 and DNA was
stained with Hoechst dye. The wild-type Dot1 protein as
well as the two mutants showed a diﬀuse nuclear staining
and seemed to be absent from the cytoplasm (Figure 4A),
suggesting that the N-terminus of Dot1 does not inﬂuence
its nuclear localization.
Dot1 methylates H3K79 throughout the entire yeast
genome and the global levels of this modiﬁcation deter-
mine the strength of telomeric silencing (1,2,26). To inves-
tigate whether the N-terminus aﬀects the catalytic activity
of Dot1, the levels of methylation of H3K79 were
analyzed in cells expressing wild-type Dot1 or only one
of the isoforms. Immunoblots using antibodies speciﬁc
for mono-, di- and trimethylated H3K79 showed no
detectable diﬀerence in global methylation when one of
the Dot1 isoforms was missing (Figure 4B). In line with
the fact that no eﬀect on the global levels of H3K79
methylation was detected, either isoform alone was suﬃ-
cient to complement the telomeric silencing defect in a
dot1D strain, when expressed from a single copy plasmid
(Figure 4C). Both isoforms were also as competent as

wild-type Dot1 to disrupt telomeric silencing when
overexpressed from the GAL1 promoter on a multi-copy
plasmid (Figure 4D). In addition, there was no diﬀerence
in activation of the DNA damage response after UV irra-
diation (data not shown).
Genetic interactions of DOT1 indicate that Dot1 might
have a function in cell wall biology (8,9). To verify this
notion, the sensitivity to the antifungal agent CFW was
examined of yeast cells with or without Dot1. Altered sen-
sitivity to CFW is an indication of a defect in chitin bio-
synthesis and/or cell wall biogenesis (39,40). When yeast
cells were grown on rich media containing galactose cells
lacking Dot1 were more resistant to CFW (Figure 5A),
lending support to the idea that Dot1 is required for cell
wall function. To examine whether the two Dot1 isoforms
might have diﬀerential functions in cell wall biogenesis, we
tested whether strains expressing either one of the
isoforms showed altered sensitivity to CFW. Two strains
were constructed in which the GAL1 promoter and a
3xHA tag were integrated either upstream of AUG1 of
the endogenous DOT1 coding sequence (PGAL1-3HA-
DOT1) or immediately downstream of AUG17, thereby
deleting the ﬁrst 17 amino acids (PGAL1-3HA-DOT1D1-
17). In both cases, a single protein species was expressed
(Figure 5B). These promoter-integration strains were used
instead of strains expressing Dot1 from a plasmid since
CFW is unstable in synthetic media necessary to ensure
propagation of the plasmids. The strain expressing only
full-length Dot1 from the GAL1 promoter was as sensitive
to CFW as the wild-type strain. In contrast, the strain
expressing only the short form of Dot1 was more resistant
to CFW, just like a dot1D strain (Figure 5A). This result
suggests that the N-terminus of Dot1 inﬂuences its cell
wall-related function.

To further investigate the possible cell wall-related
function of Dot1, the sensitivity of wild-type or mutant
cells to changes in osmolarity was tested by growing cells
on media containing diﬀerent concentrations of NaCl,
sorbitol, glycerol or SDS. However, no diﬀerences were
observed for any of the conditions (Supplementary
Figure 1). To assess a possible function for Dot1 in cell
wall biogenesis more directly, electron microscopy was
used to visualize the yeast cell wall in wild-type cells,
dot1D cells and cells expressing only full-length Dot1 or
only the short isoform from the GAL1 promoter. As a
control, kre1D cells were used, which have been
reported to lack the outer layer of the cell wall (41), as
is also clear from Figure 5C. Whereas the cell wall of
wild-type cells and dot1D cells has a ﬁnely delineated
outer layer, this layer was somewhat less structured and
more rough in texture in cells overexpressing only full-
length Dot1, and especially in cells overexpressing only
the short Dot1 isoform (Figure 5C). This result supports
the notion that Dot1 aﬀects cell wall metabolism.
However, this function of Dot1 is found only when
Dot1 is overexpressed and is not diﬀerentially aﬀected
by the two isoforms.
DISCUSSION
Yeast cells express two isoforms of the H3K79
methyltransferase Dot1. Using mutational analysis, we
determined that alternative translation by leaky scanning
results in the expression of a full-length protein and a
shorter Dot1 protein lacking the ﬁrst 16 amino acids.
Starved cells lose expression of full-length Dot1 and
maintain the short Dot1 protein (Figure 1D), suggesting
that the leaky scanning of the DOT1 transcript is depen-
dent on growth conditions.
The two isoforms showed indistinguishable localization,
bulk H3K79 methylation and silencing properties,
indicating that the global activity of Dot1 is not aﬀected
by its N-terminus. However, yeast cells expressing either
one of the two Dot1 isoforms showed a modest but repro-
ducible diﬀerence in sensitivity to CFW. Since CFW has a
high aﬃnity for chitin in the cell wall of fungi, cells that
are resistant to CFW are thought to have a defect in chitin
biosynthesis and/or cell wall biogenesis (39,40).
Interestingly, the Dot1 homolog in Drosophila, grappa,
has also recently been implicated in stress resistance (42).
Our results suggest that cells expressing the wild-type
Dot1 products or only the full-length protein are more

sensitive to CFW than cells lacking Dot1 or expressing the
short Dot1 protein only. Thus, the Dot11-17 protein
does not complement the loss of Dot1, suggesting that
the sensitivity to CFW is mediated by the N-terminal
part that is missing in the Dot1 protein synthesized after
leaky scanning. Inspection of the cell wall by electron
microcopy revealed no diﬀerence between wild-type and
dot1D cells, suggesting that the CFW resistance is not
caused by large structural re-arrangements of the cell
wall. However, the outer layer of the cell wall had a
slightly altered structure in cells overexpressing either
isoform of Dot1 compared to wild-type or dot1D cells.
This eﬀect was strongest in cells expressing only the
short Dot1 isoform. These results suggest that loss of
the Dot1 N-terminus causes subtle changes in cell wall
metabolism probably related to chitin deposition,
whereas overexpression of Dot1 causes more pronounced
changes of the cell wall.
Two previous studies have reported genetic interactions
between DOT1 and genes involved in cell wall assembly
and chitin synthesis. Deletion of DOT1 is synthetically
lethal with deletion of either CHS5, encoding a protein
that regulates targeting of the chitin synthase Chs3 to
sites of polarized growth, or of GAS1, a gene required
for cell wall assembly (8,9). CHS5 also shows genetic
interactions with BRE1 and LGE1 (9), which encode
subunits of the H2B ubiquitin ligase complex and are
required for eﬃcient H3K79 methylation (43,44).
However, expression of GAS1 and CHS5 was unaﬀected
in strains lacking Dot1 or expressing either one of the two
isoforms in the absence or presence of 20 mg/ml CFW
(data not shown). The same was true for four genes that
are induced by high CFW concentrations (ARO9, YEA4,
FUR4 and TUS1, 45) (data not shown). In addition, in
genome-wide expression proﬁling studies, loss of DOT1
had no or only a very minor eﬀect on genome-wide tran-
scription levels (46,47). We note that in contrast to the
functions of Dot1 in telomeric silencing and the DNA
damage response (26), our results suggest that the cell
wall function of Dot1 is independent of global
methylation levels (Figure 4B). Therefore, mechanism by
which Dot1 aﬀects the yeast cell wall is still elusive.
The two isoforms of the Dot1 protein in yeast are the
result of leaky scanning. Leaky scanning is a common
phenomenon in mammals and plants (14) and a few
examples have been described in yeast (36,48,49).
However, it is unclear how frequent the leaky scanning
mechanism is in yeast. In higher eukaryotes, there are
strict requirements for the sequence context around the
start codon to allow eﬃcient translation initiation. The
optimal sequence is deﬁned by the Kozak rule: a purine
at position –3 and/or a G at position +4 (14). In yeast,
these residues seem to be less critical for the initiation of
translation (31,32). However, a recent computational
study demonstrated a strong bias in yeast for an A at
position –3 and a C at position +5 (33). Our studies
show that changes in position 3 and +5 had very
little, if any, eﬀect on leaky scanning of AUG1 of
DOT1. Moreover, even replacement of the complete
DOT1 50-UTR by an exogenous sequence did not signi-
ﬁcantly aﬀect the rate of leaky scanning (Figure 2F).
Together these results strongly suggest that the 50-UTR
of the DOT1 gene is not a factor in determining the eﬃ-
ciency of translation initiation.
Besides a sub-optimal sequence context, the length of
the mRNA leader sequence can also contribute to leaky
scanning. Some mRNA transcripts have a 50-leader
sequence that is too short for the ribosome to bind eﬃ-
ciently, leading to skipping of the ﬁrst start codon (35,50).
A leader shorter than 12 nucleotides has been shown to
promote leaky scanning, and increasing the leader to more
than 20 nucleotides restores proper initiation (51).
Recently, the transcription start sites of most yeast genes
have been mapped using RNA sequencing (52). This study
showed that the mRNA transcript generated from the
DOT1 gene has a 50-leader sequence of 80 bps, which
is longer than the median of all genes (52) and much
longer than the minimal length (51). Thus, it is very
unlikely that the ﬁrst AUG is positioned too close to the
50-end of the mRNA to be recognized by the ribosome.
Translation can also be aﬀected by the 30-UTR of a tran-
script. In mammals and plants, binding of a microRNA to
its recognition sequence in the 30-UTR of a target mRNA
can inhibit cap-dependent translation initiation by a
mechanism that is not yet well-understood (53). In
addition, in speciﬁc tumor cells, the 30-UTR of the Her-
2 oncogene can override translational inhibition of the
Her-2 mRNA, showing that such mechanisms are impor-
tant in disease (54). In the case of the DOT1 transcript,
however, the 30UTR is not a key factor in translation ini-
tiation because introduction of a C-terminal tag and
thereby replacing the endogenous DOT1 30-UTR with
the 30-UTR of the ADH1 gene did not aﬀect the synthesis
of the two Dot1 isoforms (Figure 1G). This indicates that
leaky scanning of the DOT1 mRNA is aﬀected by features
in the open reading frame of the gene. Interestingly,
several cases have been reported for a role of downstream
coding sequences in translation initiation in other
eukaryotes (33,55,56). However, mutagenesis of the
sequence proximal to the initiator codon did not aﬀect
the rate of leaky scanning (Figure 3), indicating that
sequences more downstream are involved.
One possibility is that the structure of the Dot1 RNA
molecule aﬀects the eﬃciency of translation initiation.
However, mutation of the sequences immediately down-
stream of the initiator codon that were predicted to
disrupt a putative stem-loop did not aﬀect the rate of
leaky scanning (Figure 3). Another possibility might be
that the sequence between AUG1 and AUG17 contains
several ‘uncommon’ codons for low-abundance tRNAs.
If this is the case, production of the long isoform would
be energetically more taxing for the cell and leaky
scanning might therefore be favorable. However, inspec-
tion of the codons between AUG1 and AUG17 suggests
that this is unlikely. Only three of the 15 codons have the
lowest usage frequency for the amino acid they encode.
Furthermore, the average codon usage of the 15 codons
(0.024) is higher than the average codon usage for all yeast
genes (0.016). Thus, the mechanism by which the open
reading frame of the DOT1 gene aﬀects leaky scanning
is still unclear.

Recent RNA sequencing of the yeast transcriptome
predicts that transcripts of as many as 321 yeast genes
(6% of the yeast genome) contain small open reading
frames (uORFs) upstream of the ﬁrst in-frame start codon
(52). Moreover, uORFs are present in almost half of all
human and mouse transcripts (57). A number of uORFs
have now been shown to control translation of the down-
stream gene (16,57) and a key question is how the start
codons of the uORFs of a gene are used or skipped to tune
the eﬃciency of protein expression. The frequent occur-
rence in eukaryotic mRNAs of upstream AUGs or sub-
optimal start codons indicates that alternative translation
initiation plays an important role in regulation of protein
expression and might be more widespread than thought
previously (58). The discovery of alternative translation
events like the one described here will be instrumental
for understanding the mechanisms of translation start
site selection.
