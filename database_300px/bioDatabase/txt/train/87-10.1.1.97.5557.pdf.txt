ABSTRACT
Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (http://
www.hprd.org) was developed to serve as a
comprehensive collection of protein features, post-
translational modifications (PTMs) and protein–
protein interactions. Since the original report, this
database has increased to .20000 proteins
entries and has become the largest database
for literature-derived protein–protein interactions
(.30 000) and PTMs (.8000) for human proteins.
We have also introduced several new features in
HPRD including: (i) protein isoforms, (ii) enhanced
search options, (iii) linking of pathway annotations
and (iv) integration of a novel browser, GenProt
Viewer (http://www.genprot.org), developed by us
that allows integration of genomic and proteomic
information. With the continued support and
active participation by the biomedical community,
we expect HPRD to become a unique source of
curated information for the human proteome and
spur biomedical discoveries based on integration
of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data.
INTRODUCTION
The Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) is a protein
information resource that provides extensive information per-
taining to human proteins including domain architecture, pro-
tein functions, protein–protein interactions, post-translational
modifications (PTMs), enzyme–substrate relationships, sub-
cellular localization, tissue expression and disease association
of genes (1–3). In order to make HPRD a more comprehensive
resource, we have greatly expanded the number of protein
entries, protein–protein interactions and PTMs. We have
also incorporated additional query (e.g. BLAST) and browse
options and provided explanatory pages for motifs found in the
proteins cataloged in HPRD. Some of the new features include
protein isoforms, links to signal transduction pathways and
integration of GenProt Viewer, a novel browser that we
have recently developed. HPRD currently contains over
20 000 protein entries including 1587 protein isoforms and
has grown significantly in size over the last 3 years (Figure 1a).
Cataloging protein–protein interactions
A crucial aspect of any proteomic analysis is the elucidation
of interacting proteins—the interactome (4). HPRD currently
has 33 710 unique protein–protein interactions. The experi-
mental evidence for the interactions is derived from in vivo

experiments for 19 175 interactions, in vitro for 11 114 inter-
actions and yeast two-hybrid for 1813 interactions. Figure 1b
shows the distribution of the protein–protein interactions
annotated in HPRD. Table 1 shows the overall statistics as
of September 15, 2005.
Enrichment of PTMs, subcellular localization and tissue
expression data in HPRD
PTMs can alter both structure and function of proteins. In
recent years, several large-scale studies have been carried
out to characterize PTMs using proteomic methods. For
instance, 2002 phosphorylation sites were identified using
mass spectrometry from HeLa cell nuclear extract in a single
experiment (5). A total of 5011 phosphorylation events and
1132 glycosylation events are among the 8409 recorded PTMs
in HPRD (Figure 1c). Updated annotations involving subcel-
lular localization include 489 nucleolar proteins (6,7) and 270
secreted proteins (8). Similarly, tissue expression data have
been added to a number of entries including those encoded by
KIAA cDNAs (9).
Novel features added since initial release of HPRD
Protein isoforms. One of the important additions to HPRD is
the inclusion of protein isoforms. Criteria for inclusion as an
isoform include only those RefSeq database (10) entries with
different CDS (coding sequence) for the same gene. Thus,
only those alternate splice forms are considered in which
the splicing involves the coding region and not the 50 or 30
untranslated regions. All annotations are displayed for all iso-
forms by default except when isoform-specific data regarding
subcellular localization, PTMs, domain architecture or tissue
expression are available. Mainly due to lack of data, isoform-
specific annotations for protein–protein interactions, sub-
strates and disease involvement are not provided currently
but are common to all isoforms.
Enhanced search options. HPRD can be queried through gene
symbols or a variety of database accession numbers such as
RefSeq (10), OMIM (11), Swiss-Prot (12), HPRD and Entrez
Gene (13). A multiple search option is included in the updated
query system that allows the database to be queried by sim-
ultaneously specifying several different parameters. Because
accession numbers, gene symbols or protein names might still
not yield the protein being searched for, we have now also
included a BLAST option as a search tool.
Links to pathways. In order to visualize and identify the poten-
tial function of a protein in the context of a large signaling
network and its interaction partners, we have curated a number
of pathways. These pathways have been integrated through the

‘Pathways’ tab. The pathway data are diagrammatically rep-
resented using GenMAPP (Gene Microarray Pathway Profiler)
(14), a computer application designed for viewing and
analyzing the data in the context of biological pathways
(Figure 2). These pathways are a collection of literature-
derived information usually downstream of ligand-receptor
interactions. In addition to information about protein–
protein interactions, pathways include reactions involving
PTMs, shuttling of proteins between subcellular compart-
ments, activation or inhibition of enzymatic activity and up
or down regulation of mRNAs.
Integration of GenProt Viewer. HPRD provides annotations
by mapping the protein onto the genome alongwith trans-
cript and SNP information for each protein from the mole-
cule page, through GenProt Viewer (Figure 2). The GenProt
Viewer, a browser (http://www.genprot.org) developed by our
group, provides an integrated genomic, transcriptomic and
proteomic view of the human genome. Genomic annotations
that have been addressed here include the mapping of single
nucleotide polymorphisms and homology blocks of the
human genome when compared against that of mouse. Tran-
scriptomic data include RefSeq annotations and the categor-
ization of protein-coding transcripts into untranslated regions
and open reading frame. It also integrates ‘Haploview’ for
investigating population haplotype patterns (15). Experi-
mentally derived peptide sequences obtained by mass
spectrometry that have been deposited in PeptideAtlas
(http://www.peptideatlas.org) (16) and PRIDE (17) repositor-
ies are also mapped onto the genomic sequence in GenProt
Viewer. The peptides are linked to the sequence pages in
these two repositories. Finally, the BLAST option allows
users to query the genome using protein or nucleotide
sequences.
Downloading HPRD data
HPRD data are available for download in XML as well as tab
delimited file formats. Regular updates of full release of all the
data in a compressed format is available using the ‘Download’
tab (http://www.hprd.org/FAQ?selectedtab=DOWNLOAD+
REQUESTS). Interaction datasets in PSI-MI (18) format
are provided as individual files for each protein as well as a
single combined file for the entire dataset. The PSI-MI is an
evolving data format which was originally released as level
1.0. We are currently formatting the protein–protein interac-
tion data in HPRD to stay compliant with the latest version of
this specification (PSI-MI level 2.5).
Future plans
We wish to develop a Protein Distributed Annotation System,
which will enable laboratories throughout the world to annot-
ate valuable proteomic information including PTMs, tissue
expression, protein–protein interactions and enzyme–
substrate relationships in the context of HPRD data. We
hope to link any data obtained by mass spectrometry directly
to such annotations in HPRD. We are also in the process of
integrating transcriptomic data into HPRD, which will allow
gene expression patterns to be visualized in normal and
diseased states. Based on user input over the last 3 years,
we also hope to include a list of genes regulated by the
major transcription factors.

Our strategy of involving the biomedical community in pro-
viding feedback for individual entries using the ‘Comments’
button and designating interested researchers as ‘Molecule

Authority’ listed under the ‘Credits’ tab is already successful.
To make the best use of HPRD and to understand the annota-
tion procedure and philosophy, we strongly encourage all
users to visit the ‘FAQs’ page (http://www.hprd.org/FAQ).
We hope that this community involvement will continue to
intensify over the coming years in our effort to make HPRD a
knowledgebase of human proteins that will assist in biomed-
ical discoveries by serving as a complete resource of genomic,
transcriptomic and proteomic information and in providing an
integrated view of sequence, function and protein networks in
health and disease.
