Abstract—Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; CCL2)–mediated inflammation plays a critical role in the
development of ischemic heart disease (IHD). However, the gene expression changes caused by signal transduction,
triggered by MCP-1 binding to its receptor CCR2, and their possible role in the development of IHD are not understood.
We present evidence that MCP-1 binding to CCR2 induces a novel transcription factor (MCP-induced protein [MCPIP])
that causes cell death. Gene microarray analysis showed that when expressed in hiuman embryonic kidney 293 cells,
MCPIP induced apoptotic gene families before causing cell death. Mutagenesis studies showed that the structural
features required for transcription factor–like activity were also required for causing cell death. Activation of caspase-3
was detected after MCPIP transfection and Z-VAD-fmk partially inhibited cell death. Cardiomyocyte-targeted
expression of MCP-1 in mice caused death by heart failure at 6 months of age. MCPIP expression increased in parallel
with the development of ventricular dysfunction. In situ hybridization showed the presence of MCPIP transcripts in the
cardiomyocytes and immunohistochemistry showed that MCPIP was associated with the cardiomyocyte nuclei of
apoptotic cardiomyocytes. CCR2 expression in cardiomyocytes increased with the development of IHD. MCPIP
production induced by MCP-1 binding to CCR2 in the cardiomyocytes is probably involved in the development of IHD
in this murine model. MCPIP transcript levels were much higher in the explanted human hearts with IHD than with
nonischemic heart disease. These results provide a molecular insight into how chronic inflammation and exposure to
MCP-1 contributes to heart failure and suggest that MCPIP could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention. (Circ
Res. 2006;98:1177-1185.)

Inflammation is an important component of cardiovascularpathology associated with a number of types of heart
diseases. However, the mechanism by which inflammation
contributes to the development of cardiac dysfunction is
poorly understood.1–4 The recruitment and activation of
monocytes/macrophages through monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1; CCL2) are thought to be important events
that contribute to the initiation and pathophysiology of
cardiovascular diseases.5–7 MCP-1 is the main chemotactic
factor for the migration of monocytes/macrophages and the
pathogenesis of chronic inflammation.8,9 Eliminating MCP-1
function or blockade of MCP-1/CCR2 pathway has been
shown to decrease neointimal hyperplasia after injury and
atherogenesis in mice10–14 and attenuate postischemic myo-
cardial remodeling and heart failure.15 In an attempt to mimic
the inflammatory component implicated in the development
of cardiovascular diseases, transgenic mice that express
MCP-1 specifically in the heart were generated. Cardiac-
targeted expression of MCP-1 results in monocyte/macro-
phage infiltration into the heart, and the mice experience a
thrombotic occlusive arteriolar vasculopathy that results in
ischemia, interstitial fibrosis, ventricular chamber dilation,
and heart failure leading to death by 6 months of age.16,17
The binding of MCP-1 to CCR2, a trimeric G-protein–
coupled receptor on the target cell membrane, initiates a
series of signaling events that lead to chemotactic migration
toward the source of MCP-1 production.18–22 Although the
signaling triggered by MCP-1 binding to receptor has been
studied extensively, very little is known about gene expres-
sion changes resulting from this signaling. We showed
previously that IL-1 gene was upregulated by MCP-1
treatment of monocytes.23 We also used a genomic approach

with gene arrays to identify MCP-1–induced genes in human
monocytes. Analysis of changes in the expression of genes
caused by MCP-1 treatment of human peripheral blood
monocytes revealed transcriptional activation of a variety of
genes encoding known proteins and several expressed
squence tags (ESTs) that were not homologous to any known
proteins (our unpublished data, 2001). Here we report the
identification of the most highly induced EST as a fragment
of a cDNA encoding a heretofore unknown protein that we
designate MCP-induced protein (MCPIP). We present evi-
dence that this protein represents a novel transcription factor
of which the expression causes cell death. We also present
evidence that suggests that the expression of this transcription
factor is probably linked to the development of ischemic heart
disease in both a murine model and in human providing novel
insights into how chronic inflammation and exposure to
elevated MCP-1 levels contributes to development of ische-
mic heart disease.
Materials and Methods
Tissue Samples
Human heart tissues were obtained from the Ohio State University
hospital. All animal and human materials used were in accordance
with the approval of institutional review boards and animal use
committees.
Purification of Human Monocytes
Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coat preparations
(American Red Cross) using Ficoll-Plaque PLUS (Amersham Phar-
macia Biotech AB), an indirect magnetic labeling system and a
monocyte isolation kit. Flow cytometry using double staining with
antibodies CD14-FITC and CD45-PE showed 90% purity.
Cloning of Human MCPIP From Human
Monocytes After Treatment With MCP-1
Monocytes were treated with 7 nmol/L MCP-1, and total RNA was
isolated with Trizol reagent (GIBCO); cDNA was prepared using
Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (GIBCO).
The human MCPIP (hMCPIP) cDNA was prepared by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) from total cDNA as template and the following
primers: 5-CGCATATGAGTGGCCCCTGTGGAG-3 (sense) and
5-CGGGATCCTTACTCACTGGGGTGCTGG-3 (antisense). The
expected size PCR product was recovered, ligated to the vector
pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and the reaction mixture was used to transform
to TOPO10 competent cells. Colonies were screened, and inserts
were sequenced.
Expression of Human MCPIP in Escherichia coli
and Preparation of Antibodies
hMCPIP open reading frame (ORF) from pCR2.1/hMCPIP obtained
with BamHI and NdeI, was expressed in pET16b in E coli BL21.
Rabbit polyclonal antibody was prepared against the recombinant
hMCPIP.35
In Situ Hybridization
A 406-bp cDNA fragment from murine MCPIP (mMCPIP) ORF
(from 403 to 809 bp) and 352-bp fragment from CCR2 ORF (from
722 to 1073 bp) were generated by PCR with specific primers,
cloned into dual-promoter vector pCRII, and the ligation mixture
was used to transform competent cells of TOPO10. The recombinant
plasmids, linearized with KpnI, was used as template for in vitro
transcription with RNA polymerase and digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled
uridine-triphosphate using a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche). Frozen
optimum cutting temperature compound–embedded sections were
hybridized with DIG-labeled RNA probes (antisense or sense) and
processed using standard procedures with anti-DIG antibodies
conjugated-alkaline phosphatase.
Construction of Mutant MCPIP
Standard PCR methods were used to generate the mutants. The
nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence RKKP was mutated to
GGGP, the two conserved amino acids KC within zinc finger motif
was changed to GG. The following primers were used: for NLS-
primer I (antisense): 5AAGTGAGTGGACCTCCACCCAGG-
AAGTTGTCCAGGCT-3, for zinc finger motif mutation, primer II
(sense): 5-CTATGGGATCGGTGGAGGATTCTTCCAC-
CCAGAG-3, for cloning the whole ORF of hMCPIP, primer III
(sense): 5-CGGAATTCAAATGAGTGGCCCCTGTGGAG-3, and

primer IV (antisense): 5-CGGGATCCGCCTCACTGGGGT-
GCTGGGA-3; EcoRI and BamHI sites are used in the primer III or
IV. PCR products were ligated to the N terminus of enhanced green
fluorescence protein within the vector pEGFP-N1 by using EcoRI
and BamHI and used to transform TOPO10 competent cells. Dele-
tion of praline-rich regions was created using QuikChange Site-
Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. The 298–378 deletion
was created using 5-AGCGCCAGACCTCAGAAGAGGAAAAG-
GAGG-3 and 5-CCTCCTTTTCCTCTTCTGAGGTCTGGCGCT-3 as
mutagenic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides used for the 458–536
deletion were 5-GGGGTTCGAGGAGGAGGCGGGGCTGGCAGG-
AGCCCGTGGGGC-3 and 5-GCCCCACGGGCTCCTGC-CAGCC
CCGCCTCCTCCTCGAACCCC-3, and for the deletion of the both
regions, deleted proline2 region construct was used as a template and the
same primers for the deletion of the first praline-rich region were used. All
substitution and deletion mutants were confirmed by sequencing.
Cell Culture, Transfection, and Measurement of
Cell Death and Viability
Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 (4105) cells, grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% of penicillin and strepto-
mycin, were transiently transfected with pEGFP/hMCPIP or its
mutants or control pEGFP-N1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 per the
manufacturer protocol (Invitrogen). After 30 hours, cells were
stained with propodium iodide and examined with a confocal
microscope (MRC-600 Series Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging
System; Bio-Rad). Cell viability and death were measured by trypan
blue and TUNEL assays using standard procedures.36
In Vivo Labeling of Active Caspase-3 and
Inhibition of Cell Death by Caspase Inhibitor
HEK293 cells (106) were treated with 10 mol/L biotin-Val-Ala-
Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (MP Biomedicals) for 1 hour at
37°C in 5% CO2 followed by lysis in 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton
X-100, 8% 0.5 mol/L EDTA, 1% 1 mol/L dithiothreitol. Biotinylated
proteins, captured with streptavidin-conjugated beads (Calbiochem)
overnight at 4°C, were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacryl-
amide gel. Immunoblot was done with caspase-3 antibody (1:2000;
Cell Signaling) and horseradish peroxidase–anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (1:5000) and visualized with Super Signal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate from Pierce. Effect of 100 mol/L
Z-VAD-fmk on cell death was assessed by trypan blue staining.
In Vitro Assay for Transcription Factor Activity
We constructed a fusion protein of GAL4DNA binding with MCPIP
and its mutants as test plasmid. The reporter plasmid had five GAL4

control, activating transcription factor 4 was used to activate the
luciferase gene.37 Experiments were repeated at least three times.
Real-Time PCR and RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated with the RNAeasy kit (Invitrogen) from
human and murine hearts, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized
using 1 g total RNA (DNase-treated) using I Script cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad); -actin served as internal control. Primers designed

Localization of MCPIP and Apoptosis in the Heart
Paraffin-embedded sections were blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide
incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human MCPIP antibody or
isotype control overnight at 4°C, incubated with horseradish peroxi-
dase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy), visualized with diaminobenzidine, and sections were counter-
stained with hematoxylin. For dual labeling, sections were first
stained by TUNEL for identifying apoptotic nuclei with streptavidin-
fluorescent (R&D Systems) and then by immunohistochemistry for
determination of MCPIP expression with goat anti-rabbit IgG con-
jugated with Alexa 594 (Invitrogen), visualized under Nike fluores-
cence microscopy.
Apoptosis Microarray Analysis
The nonradioactive human apoptosis oligomicroarrays (Super Array;
Biosciences Corp.) were used. The HEK293 cells were transfected
(LipofectAMINE) with MCPIP–GFP or GFP alone as control for 6
hours in serum-free medium and then incubated in complete medium
for 16 hours before the isolation of RNA. The expression profiling
was done according to manufacturer instructions.
Statistical Analysis
The experimental data were analyzed by using SPSS statistical
software (SPSS Inc.) under Windows XP. All values are presented as
meanSEM. Real-time PCR data were expressed as fold upregula-
tion compared with sex- and age-matched wild-type controls. Results
were compared between groups by ANOVA analysis followed by t
tests. Differences were considered significant at a P value of 0.05.
Results
Human MCPIP Gene and Protein
Treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes with MCP-1
resulted in the transcriptional activation of a variety of genes,
including those that encode a variety of cytokines and
chemokines, extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, cell
adhesion proteins, and a set of ESTs (our unpublished data,
2001). The most highly induced EST, representing unidenti-
fied genes, was matched with a human cDNA clone with
GeneBank accession number AW206332, which maps to a
gene for a novel protein (FLJ23231) of unknown function on
chromosome 1p33-35.3. BLAST of the EST sequence against
database from NCBI and Celera showed homologous regions
in the human genomic DNA. BCM Genefinder was used to
predict the exons and the ORF. Databases from NCBI and
Celera showed that the human MCPIP gene was of 8.9 kb in
length and contained 5 exons and 4 introns. RNA from human
peripheral blood monocytes treated with MCP-1 was used to
perform RT-PCR to generate cDNA representing hMCPIP.
The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA showed an
ORF that would encode a protein containing 599 amino acids
with a calculated mass of 65.8 kDa (accession number
AY920403). Protein motif analysis showed that MCPIP
contains two praline-rich potential activation domains (Figure
1A), one between residues 100 and 126 with 37% proline
residues and the other at 458 to 536 with 28% proline
residues. It also contains a putative monopartite NLS se-
quence (RKKP) and a single zinc finger motif. Thus, MCPIP
has features characteristic of a transcription factor.
Mouse genome data search revealed a gene highly homol-
ogous to human mcpip gene. RT-PCR of mRNA isolated
from a 6-month-old MCP mouse heart gave the mMCPIP
cDNA that showed a 596-aa ORF (accession number

proline-rich domain mutants 1 and 2; ZNF, zinc finger mutant.

AY920404). Sequence of this cDNA showed 80% identity at
the nucleotide level and 82% identity at the amino acid level
to that of human MCPIP. The mMCPIP expressed in
HEK293 cells strongly cross-reacted with rabbit anti-
hMCPIP antibodies (data not shown).
Induction of MCPIP by Treatment of Human
Monocytes With MCP-1
To verify the data from gene arrays, we examined the
production of MCPIP transcripts in human monocytes after
treatment with 7 nmol/L MCP-1 by RNA blot analysis with
the cloned cDNA for hMCPIP as a probe. The results showed
that the expected 1.8-kb transcript was found only in MCP-1–
treated human monocytes (Figure 1B). Anti-CCR2 blocked
MCP-1–induced synthesis of MCPIP (Figure 1C), showing that
this induction involved MCP-1 binding to its receptor CCR2.
Localization of MCPIP
Because the structural features suggested MCPIP to be a
transcription factor, we tested whether it is localized in the
nucleus. MCPIP–GFP expressed in HEK293 cells was found to
be localized in the nucleus, whereas in the control, GFP was
found to be distributed throughout the cell (Figure 2A). Pro-
pidium iodide that stained the nucleus (red) was colocalized with
GFP, resulting in the yellow color on merging of the two images.
Cell Death Caused by Expression of MCPIP
In situ TUNEL assay was performed on HEK293 cells after
transfection with MCPIP–GFP or GFP alone (control). Trans-
fection with either plasmid resulted in the appearance of
robust and equal GFP fluorescence within 16 hours after
transfection. During the next five days, blebbing of plasma
membrane, nuclear condensation, and disintegration became
clear. Trypan blue staining showed that MCPIP expression
caused cell death. Expression of MCPIP caused apoptosis
detectable by TUNEL positivity (Figure 2B). Apoptosis was
also demonstrated by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage in HEK293 cells transfected with MCPIP–GFP
(Figure 2C). MCPIP caused cell death also in cardiomyoblast
cell line H9C2. Three days after infection with adenovirus
expressing MCPIP–GFP, 262.2% cells were trypan blue
positive, whereas GFP control and uninfected control showed
151.4% and 121.0% trypan blue staining cells,
respectively.
To test whether caspase-3 activation occurs in the MCPIP-
expressing cell, an activation-specific labeling of the caspases
was done using biotin-Z-VAD-fmk that would covalently
attach biotin only to enzymatically active caspase. Recovery
of the biotin-labeled protein with avidin and immunological
detection showed 17-kDa and 12-kDa species expected from
activation of caspase-3 (Figure 2D). That the MCPIP-induced
cell death probably involved caspase activation was shown by
the finding that pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk partially
inhibited MCPIP-induced cell death (Figure 2E).
Transcription Factor–Like Activity of MCPIP
The ability of MCPIP to transactivate transcription was tested
in an in vitro system. Cotransfection of HEK293 cells with
GAL4–MCPIP and the pGal4-Luc reporter demonstrated that
MCPIP activated transcription of the luciferase reporter gene
showing 865-fold/mg protein after transfection for 24 hours,
whereas the positive control containing activating transcrip-
tion factor-4 (ATF4) showed 1263-fold. This result demon-
strated that MCPIP could act as a positive regulator of
transcription.
To determine whether cell death caused by MCPIP is
related to its transcription factor–like activity, we compared

the effects of mutations in the putative domains thought to be
important for transactivation on the transactivation and the
cell death–inducing activities of the MCPIP (Figure 3A and
3B). Mutation of the Zn finger domain caused a drastic
decrease in both transactivation and death-inducing ability.
Mutation of either praline-rich domain or both caused drastic
reduction in cell death–inducing activity. Mutation of the
putative NLS showed very little effect on transcription factor
activity and cell death–inducing activity. Confocal micros-
copy showed that this mutation did not affect nuclear local-
ization (data not shown). Thus, the structural features that are
essential for the transcription factor–like activity are also
essential for cell death–inducing activity, indicating that
MCPIP transcriptionally activates genes of which expression
is involved in cell death.
Induction of Apoptotic Genes by MCPIP
Expression in HEK293 Cells
To determine whether expression of MCPIP causes detect-
able upregulation of genes known to be involved in cell death,
microarray analysis was done with RNA isolated soon after
MCPIP expression was clearly indicated by the fluorescence
of the fused GFP (16 hours) but before cell death was
detectable. This gene expression profile showed that MCPIP
caused induction of several genes the products of which are
known to be involved in cell death (Table 1).
Association of MCPIP Expression With Ischemic
Heart Disease
Because MCP-1 and cell death has been associated with
development heart disease6,7,24 and MCPIP induces death in
cell cultures, we examined whether MCPIP expression is
associated with the heart disease in the transgenic mouse
model for heart failure, in which cardiac inflammation is
induced by cardiomyocyte-targeted expression of MCP-1.16,17
Real-time PCR analysis of the MCPIP transcript levels
showed that the transgenic animals expressed much higher
levels of MCPIP when compared with age and sex-matched
wild-type controls. As the MCP mice aged, levels of MCP-1
and MCPIP transcripts increased in the heart, and fractional
shortening decreased (Figure 4A through 4C).
In situ hybridization showed that MCPIP transcripts were
in cardiomyocytes (Figure 5A). MCPIP immunostaining
further demonstrated the accumulation of this protein in
myocyte of MCP mice, and MCPIP staining was associated
with the nuclei of cardiomyocytes (Figure 5B). In MCP mice,
MCPIP levels were easily detected immunologically when the
animals reached 2 months of age. When clinical symptoms of
heart failure were very obvious at 6 months of age (fractional
shortening 20%), the nuclei of many cardiomyocytes were
degraded and appeared like vacuoles, and in such cases, MCPIP
staining was associated with the periphery of such vacuoles;
vacuolation is a characteristic ultrastructural feature of heart
failure in the MCP mice as is found also in the human failing
myocardium.24 In the hearts of wild-type mice, MCPIP staining
was hardly detectable at any age (Figure 5B). In 4-month-old
MCP mouse hearts, most cells strongly expressing MCPIP were
also found to be TUNEL positive (Figure 5C).
Induction of CCR2 in Cardiomyocytes
Real-time PCR showed elevation of CCR2 transcript levels in
MCP mouse hearts at 2 months of age, before the develop-
ment of clinical manifestation of the heart disease and CCR2
levels increased further until 4 months of age (Figure 6A). In
situ hybridization clearly showed that CCR2 transcript was
present within the cardiomyocytes of MCP mice (Figure 6B).
Elevated Levels of MCPIP in Ischemic
Human Hearts
Because MCPIP expression is associated with ischemic heart
failure in the murine model, we considered the possibility that
MCPIP expression may be a feature of human ischemic heart
disease. Therefore, we measured the MCPIP transcript levels
in human heart tissue from explanted hearts by real-time
PCR. In these patients of comparable age, seven were
classified as ischemic and the other six nonischemic. Patients
were classified as having ischemic cardiomyopathy based on
a clinical history of documented coronary artery disease,
myocardial infarction, or evidence of ischemia by exercise or
pharmacological stress testing before transplantation. Nonis-
chemic patients showed diopathic-dilated cardiomyopathy
and normal coronary angiogram with no specific reason for
cardiac dysfunction. The clinical data on the patients indi-

cated that the hearts of both groups were compromised to a
comparable degree (Table 2). Remarkably, the ischemic
hearts showed much higher levels of MCPIP than the nonis-
chemic hearts (Table 2).
Discussion
It is becoming widely recognized that MCP-1 is involved in
the development of cardiovascular diseases.6,7 The signaling
events initiated by MCP-1 binding to CCR2 probably leads to
transcriptional activation of genes for which products could
lead to pathophysiological changes. However, little is known
about them. Gene array analysis revealed that a set of genes
are upregulated (unpublished data, 2001). These included a
number of heretofore unidentified genes. Among the highly
induced nonannotated human genes, the most highly induced
one, that we designate MCPIP, has structural motifs that are
characteristic of transcription factors. We demonstrate with
an in vitro assay that MCPIP can activate transcription of a
reporter gene.
Expression of MCPIP–GFP in HEK293 cells showed
nuclear localization of the protein and caused cell death.
Mutagenesis of the various motifs in MCPIP that are charac-
teristic of transcription factors affected the in vitro transacti-
vation ability of MCPIP and the death-inducing activity in
HEK293 cells in a similar manner. This finding strongly
suggests that MCPIP mediates transcriptional activity of
genes involved in cell death. Microarray analysis of the
transcripts present in HEK293 cells soon after MCPIP ex-
pression indicated that MCPIP expression caused upregula-
tion of transcript known to be involved in cell death. These
include components of caspase activation, cytochrome C
release, production of reactive oxygen, unique subsets of
BCL2 family of genes, and tumor necrosis factor receptor
family members.25–28 It is probable that MCPIP-induced
proteins are involved in one or more of the multiple forms of
cell death that occur in ischemic heart disease.29 Although the
components involved in the cell death caused by MCPIP
remain to be elucidated, we present evidence that caspases are
involved. Using an activation-specific avidin labeling
method, we demonstrate caspase-3 activation and show
inhibition of cell death by a pan–caspase inhibition. PARP
cleavage also demonstrated apoptosis.
Figure 5. A, In situ hydridization showing
elevated expression of MCPIP in the car-
diomyocytes of MCP mice. B, Immuno-
histochemical detection of MCPIP in the
hearts of MCP mice. Condensed nuclei
staining (brown) with MCPIP was
observed in cardiomyocytes and infiltrat-
ing inflammatory cells in MCP mice of 2
and 4 months of age (IV and V); a strong
staining for MCPIP was more prominent
in the cardiomyocytes showing vacuol-
ization (VI; arrows) in 6-month-old MCP
mice with heart failure. MCPIP staining
was also found in vascular endothelial
and smooth muscle cells (data not
shown). The hearts from age-, sex-
matched wild-type controls showed a
weak nuclear staining (original magnifica-
tion 400). C, Double staining on the
heart tissue showed that most cells with
high expression of MCPIP (detected by
immunostaining) also were apoptotic as
indicated by TUNEL.

MCPIP production increases dramatically with the age of
MCP mice. Both in situ hybridization and immunohistochem-
istry show that MCPIP is within the cardiomyocytes, and that
MCPIP is located in the nuclei in vivo as observed with
MCPIP-GFP fusion protein in HEK cells in culture. Inhibi-
tion of MCPIP production by anti-CCR2 in cell culture and
the elevated level of CCR2 in the heart of MCP-1 mice
suggest that the MCPIP production involved the signal
transduction events triggered by MCP-1 binding to CCR2.
CCR2 induction by prolonged exposure to MCP-1 has not
been reported previously. In MCP mice, C-reactive protein
levels are elevated (our unpublished data, 2006), and this
protein is known to induce CCR2 expression.30,31
The present findings on the MCP model appear to be
reflected in human disease. In human myocardium, chemo-
kines and their receptors were reported to be upregulated,
especially CCR2 and CXCR4.32 Real-time PCR analysis of
transcripts in human heart tissue obtained during heart trans-
plant surgery of individuals of comparable age showed that
hearts with ischemic disease contained much higher levels of
MCPIP transcripts than in the hearts with nonischemic
disease, although both groups were at end stages of the
disease with comparable degrees of functional compromise.
Many reports implicate involvement of MCP-1 in the
development of ischemic heart disease,5–7 although in some
circumstances, MCP-1 shows a protective effect against
ischemia/reperfusion injury.33,34 We found that chronic ex-
pression of MCP-1 in cardiomyocytes leads to ischemic heart
disease that manifests the clinical, pathological, ultrastruc-
tural, and molecular features found in human ischemic heart
disease.18,19 How chronic inflammation and prolonged expo-
sure of the myocardium to elevated levels of MCP-1 cause
heart failure remains unclear. The present findings that
MCP-1 treatment of human monocytes causes induction of a
novel transcription factor, MCPIP, that is also induced in the
heart of the murine MCP model of ischemic heart disease and
found at much higher levels in human hearts with ischemic
disease when compared with nonischemic heart disease, all
strongly suggest that the newly discovered transcription
factor causes cell death and thus plays an important role in the
development of ischemic heart disease. This finding provides
a novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which
chronic inflammation and exposure to MCP-1 contributes to
development of heart failure. If confirmed in further studies,
this transcription factor could be a potential target for
therapeutic intervention.
