ABSTRACT
The MiST2 database (http://mistdb.com) identifies
and catalogs the repertoire of signal transduction
proteins in microbial genomes. Signal transduction
systems regulate the majority of cellular activities
including the metabolism, development, host-
recognition, biofilm production, virulence, and
antibiotic resistance of human pathogens. Thus,
knowledge of the proteins and interactions that
comprise these communication networks is an
essential component to furthering biomedical dis-
covery. These are identified by searching protein
sequences for specific domain profiles that impli-
cate a protein in signal transduction. Compared
to the previous version of the database, MiST2
contains a host of new features and improvements
including the following: draft genomes; extra-
cytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor protein
identification; enhanced classification of signaling
proteins; novel, high-quality domain models for
identifying histidine kinases and response
regulators; neighboring two-component genes;
gene cart; better search capabilities; enhanced
taxonomy browser; advanced genome browser;
and a modern, biologist-friendly web interface.
MiST2 currently contains 966 complete and 157
draft bacterial and archaeal genomes, which collec-
tively contain more than 245 000 signal transduction
proteins. The majority (66%) of these are one-
component systems, followed by two-component
proteins (26%), chemotaxis (6%), and finally ECF
factors (2%).
INTRODUCTION
In all living organisms, signal transduction systems link
extracellular signals to appropriate cellular responses.
In multicellular eukaryotes, hormones, cyto- and
chemokines, and neurotransmitters comprise the major
signaling molecules. In prokaryotes and unicellular
eukaryotes, the major signals consist of various physico-
chemical parameters of the environment: small molecules,
light, oxygen, temperature, and other stimuli. The molec-
ular machinery that transmits intracellular signals is quite
diﬀerent in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes
utilize rather complex signal transduction cascades that
are usually initiated by G-protein coupled receptors and
ion channels, while prokaryotes employ simpler signal
transduction systems that typically consist of one or two
proteins (1,2). Historically, the best studied mode of
prokaryotic signal transduction is two-component signal-
ing (1). In a typical two-component system, the input
domain of the sensor histidine kinase detects an environ-
mental signal, which results in the activation of the kinase
domain followed by autophosphoryation at a speciﬁc
histidine residue. The phosphoryl group is then trans-
ferred to a speciﬁc aspartate residue in the receiver
domain of the second protein, a response regulator
(RR). This phosphorylation event activates the output
domain of the RR, which triggers the cellular response.
Most output domains in bacterial RR bind DNA and
therefore act as transcriptional regulators (3); however,
many other output domains have enzymatic activities,
for example, regulating the concentration of the second
messenger, cyclic di-GMP (4). Some RR do not have a
distinct output domain and their regulatory function
resides within the receiver domain. A classic example of
such a response regulator is a chemotaxis protein, CheY,
which controls the rotational direction of the bacterial
ﬂagellar motor (5).
A comprehensive genomic study of more than a
hundred microbial genomes revealed that two-component
regulatory systems are not the prevalent mode of signal
transduction in prokaryotes (3). The majority of signal
transduction systems in prokaryotes consist of a single
protein that contains both input and output domains,
but lacks phosphotransfer domains typical of two-
component signaling. Such regulatory proteins were
termed ‘‘one-component systems’’ (3). On average,

microbial genomes contain many more one-component
than two-component systems. In addition to these two
principal modes of signal transduction in prokaryotes,
other signaling elements are recognized. The chemotaxis
signal transduction system (5) involves several specialized
proteins in addition to a specialized version of a
histidine kinase. Therefore, it is often viewed as a unique
case of two-component signaling. Finally, recent studies
implicated extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma
factors as yet another mode of signal transduction in
prokaryotes (6–8).
Due to its functional diversity (linking numerous signals
to various types of responses via diﬀerent modes) that
translates into extreme sequence variation of input and
output domains, pronounced domain shuﬄing, and vari-
ability of interacting modules, signal transduction presents
a major challenge for genomic identiﬁcation and logical
classiﬁcation. The only automated procedure for identify-
ing signal transduction proteins is implemented in
the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins
(COG) database (9) as a special ‘‘Signal Transduction’’
category; however, in contrast to other categories of this
resource, the ‘‘Signal Transduction’’ category contains
many erroneous annotations, due to the reasons outlined
above. Because COG is an integral part of many genome
annotation platforms, these ﬂawed annotations propagate
to downstream analyses.
To provide a better classiﬁcation system and an elec-
tronic resource that can be used for genome annotation,
we have designed MiST, a Microbial Signal Transduction
database (10). Since its launch in 2006, MiST has been
accessed by more than 5000 unique users and was used
for annotation in several genome projects (11–17). These
results establish MiST as a useful community database
and genome annotation tool. Our continuous eﬀorts in
improving MiST resulted in the new database release
(MiST2 presented here) with many new features and
signiﬁcant improvements.
NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS
Draft genomes
The original MiST database only supports the analysis of
completely sequenced genomes; however, many genome
sequencing projects result in intermediate assemblies.
Despite incomplete coverage and some inaccuracies due
to the preliminary nature of this data, many researchers
are interested in the signal transduction properties of such
draft genomes. Furthermore, some incomplete genomes
are never closed/ﬁnished and provide the only genome
record available. Thus, we have enhanced our database
implementation and annotation pipeline to support the
analysis of draft genomes. Available draft genomes with
Refseq annotations are downloaded from NCBI and pro-
cessed in a similar fashion as complete genomes; however,
instead of complete chromosomes and plasmids, draft
genomes typically consist of tens to hundreds of individual
contigs. Distinct draft versions of the same genome are
handled as separate genomes, which enables the com-
parison of diﬀerent genome versions.
Extra-cytoplasmic function (ECF) proteins
A specialized subunit of the bacterial holoenzyme, sigma
(s) factors direct RNA polymerase to bind to speciﬁc
promoter sequences. In addition to a primary,
housekeeping s factor, bacteria may also contain alterna-
tive s factors that substitute for the core s factor and
redirect transcription to alternative promoter binding
sites (18). ECF s factors, the smallest and most diverse
sub-family of s70 proteins, consist of only two domains,
s2 and s4, which participate both in RNA polymerase
interaction and recognition of the bipartite sequence
motif of the alternative promoter site. ECF s factors
comprise the largest group of alternative s factors and
represent the third most abundant bacterial signaling
mechanism. In the absence of a suitable stimulus, ECF
s factors are usually bound by a cognate anti-s factor
and thereby kept inactive. Upon receiving an appropriate
environmental signal, the anti-s factor releases the ECF s
factor, which then redirects transcription after binding to
the RNA polymerase (6,7).
Staron´ et al. performed a comprehensive phylogenomic
analysis of the ECF s factor protein family and devised a
proﬁle-based system for identifying and classifying these
unique signaling proteins into distinct ECF groups (8).
Using their collection of 44 group-speciﬁc hidden
Markov models (HMMs) and classiﬁcation system, we
identify and catalog ECF s factors for each genome in
addition to one- and two-component signaling proteins.
The full annotation of each ECF group is included in
MiST2 and linked from annotated ECF s factors.
Updated signaling proﬁle collection
All signal transduction proteins are identiﬁed based on the
presence and/or absence of speciﬁc signaling domain
proﬁles. In addition to the ECF HMMs, we have
expanded the collection of signaling proﬁles to 166 Pfam
domains (19) and created a custom signaling library,
Agfam (Supplementary Table S1). The Agfam library
currently consists of a receiver domain proﬁle (RR) that
models the conserved receiver domain of response
regulators and 24 proﬁles that represent the catalytic
(transmitter) domain (HK_CA) of histidine kinases
(HK). Our approach for generating these proﬁles relies
on exhaustive PSI-BLAST searches seeded with bona-ﬁde
family members (those with known 3D structures) to
identify homologous sequences and careful semi-
automatic construction of multiple sequence alignments
(Figure 1). Due to the extreme conservation of receiver
domains, we were able to produce a quality alignment of
all 26 492 receiver domain sequences found in the UniProt
database (19 May 2008). In contrast, the transmitter
domain of HK is signiﬁcantly less conserved and it was
not possible to produce a single high-quality alignment of
all HK_CA domains. Instead, we generated 23 individual
proﬁles (labeled HK_CA:1–23, covering 16 829 sequences)
that correspond to speciﬁc clusters of closely related
members, and a general proﬁle, which represents the
overall sequence characteristics of the histidine kinase
catalytic domain family.
D402 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, Database issue
We evaluated the performance of our HK_CA proﬁles
versus the Pfam HATPase_c domain (accession PF02518)
using a test set of 875 complete bacterial and archaeal
genomes (July 2009). Overall, the HK_CA proﬁles
demonstrated similar sensitivity to HATPase_c, yet
superior speciﬁcity for sensor histidine kinase proteins.
The seed alignment for the HATPase_c domain contains
662 sequences extracted from the SwissProt database
and models the ATPase domains of HK, DNA gryases,
heat-shock proteins, topoisomerases, phytochrome-like
ATPases, and DNA mismatch repair proteins.
Consequently, the HATPase_c proﬁle is only 90%
speciﬁc for sensor kinase proteins as opposed to 99.8%
for our HK_CA proﬁles. We attribute the higher
speciﬁcity of HK_CA to two factors. First, the seed
alignments do not contain any functionally unrelated
(e.g. gyrase, heat-shock proteins, etc.) sequences. Second,
the HK_CA seed alignments consist of nearly 17 000
sequences drawn from a much larger protein space and
thus are much more representative. A HMMER search
(20) with the RR proﬁle against the proteomes associated
with 875 complete genomes revealed 32 162 instances of
this domain. In contrast, HMMER searches with the
Pfam Response_reg model identiﬁed only 31 149 receiver
domains. Only 56 of the Response_reg hits were not found
by our RR proﬁle. Conversely, 1070 receiver domains
were uniquely recognized by the RR proﬁle. These
results substantiate that our RR proﬁle is the most sensi-
tive means for identifying RR.
Improved classiﬁcation
The original MiST database (10) simply grouped signal
transduction proteins into two categories, one- and
two-component proteins, and provided a basic interface
for browsing these proteins. Using the expanded signaling
domain repertoire described earlier, we have signiﬁcantly
enhanced our domain-based classiﬁcation with a hierar-
chical rule system for more speciﬁcally classifying these
major modes of signal transduction (Table 1). We
identify proteins comprising two-component regulatory
systems by ﬁrst searching for matches to the conserved
transmitter and receiver domains of HK and RR, respec-
tively. Based on the presence and absence of these
hallmark domains, detected two-component proteins
are further classiﬁed into the following ﬁve distinct
groups: HK, RR, hybrid histidine kinase (HHK), hybrid
response regulator (HRR), and ‘‘other’’. Hybrid two-
component proteins contain both transmitter and
receiver domains. Relatively few of these proteins have
been experimentally studied and no rigorous experimental
basis is available for classifying these proteins. Thus, we
group them based on the linear position of the transmitter
and receiver domains within the protein sequence.
HHKs have transmitter domains N-terminally to
receiver domains, whereas HRRs have receiver domains
N-terminally to transmitter domains. HKs contain a
transmitter domain (represented by multiple Pfam and
Agfam domain proﬁles in our list of signaling domains,
Supplementary Table S1) and do not contain receiver
domains. In contrast, RRs contain a receiver domain
but no transmitter domain. Remaining proteins that
are recognized as parts of two-component signaling
(e.g. stand-alone histidine phosphotransfer domains
recognized by the Hpt proﬁle, accession PF01627) are
placed in the ‘‘other’’ category.
Figure 1. Semi-automatic algorithm for deﬁning high-quality domain models. (A) Bona ﬁde domain members which have had their structure solved
are subjected to iterative PSI-BLAST searches (30) against the UniRef90 (31) database with a stringent E-value threshold. The resulting sequences
are then clustered, aligned and edited (CAT, part B) to form the set of core homologs. Remote homologs are identiﬁed by the same procedure with a
much relaxed threshold and then removing hits that do not match a secondary structure type associated with at least one core homolog. The
resulting remote homologs are combined with the core homologs and then subjected to the CAT process to produce the ﬁnal domain model(s). (B)
The CAT sub-algorithm is a divide-and-conquer method for addressing the extreme sequence divergence present in signal transduction families.
Markov Clustering Linkage (32) simulates a random-walk through all-versus-all BLAST results and produces clusters of related members. After
aligning and editing each individual subgroup, they are further combined into one or more ﬁnal curated alignments.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, Database issue D403
Two special cases exist for ﬁltering out non-signaling
proteins. First, in addition to the catalytic domain of
HK, the Pfam HATPase_c seed alignments contain
sequences belonging from structurally related ATPase
proteins (see above) that do not participate in signal
transduction. Consequently, searches with the
HATPase_c proﬁle rank these proteins as statistically sig-
niﬁcant. We ﬁlter out these proteins which contain a
HATPase_c signaling domain in combination with any
of the following Pfam models: DNA_gyraseA_C,
DNA_gyraseB, DNA_gyraseB_C, Toprim, HSP90,
DNA_topoisoIV, DNA_mis_repair, MutL_C, and
Topo-VIb_trans. Second, the hydrolase domain, HD,
which is implicated in signal transduction (21), frequently
occurs in other non-signaling proteins. We exclude
HD-containing proteins from the list of signal
transduction proteins if they also contain the following
non-signaling Pfam domains: PolyA_pol, TGS,
RelA_SpoT, KH_1, KH_2, tRNA_anti, PPx-GppA,
DEAD, Helicase_C, and tRNA-synt_1d.
Chemotaxis is the best studied prokaryotic signaling
pathway, which typically consists of several key proteins
that functionally link an environmental signal with
motility (5). Because the chemotaxis pathway is based
on a specialized version of a histidine kinase (CheA) and
a response regulator (CheY), it is considered a distinct
part of two-component signaling (2). Based on the work
performed by Wuichet and colleagues (22), we use speciﬁc
chemotaxis domain models to classify chemotaxis proteins
into the major protein groups: CheA, CheV, CheW,
CheR, CheB, CheCX, CheD, CheZ, and ‘‘other’’ (Table
1). Unfortunately, the Pfam proﬁles, CheZ and CheC, are
not well deﬁned and fail to accurately identify all target
proteins. Moreover, the CheC proﬁle does not well dis-
criminate between CheC and CheX proteins, and thus
proteins with this domain are labeled CheCX (22).
Despite these shortcomings, we were able to document
and organize more than 15 400 chemotaxis proteins and
provide more speciﬁc information on this special class of
two-component signaling.
Identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of neighboring
two-component proteins
Many experimentally studied two-component systems are
encoded as pairs on a chromosome, and response regula-
tor genes commonly co-occur adjacent to their regulatory
targets (2). Moreover, MiST database searches across all
genomes reveal that two-component genes frequently
occur (62%) as genomic neighbors (10). Consequently,
neighboring two-component genes likely encode function-
ally coupled two-component systems and are excellent
candidates for future experimental research.
Based on these principles, we systematically identify all
sets of neighboring two-component genes for each genome
and classify them into four basic groups according to
their genomic context. All members of a two-component
set must belong to the same gene string, which we
operationally deﬁne as a contiguous set of genes
oriented in the same direction (i.e. strand), each separated
by no more than 200 base pairs, and not interrupted by
any gene encoded in the opposite direction. Within the
context of a given gene string, distinct two-component
sets must be at least three genes apart and are classiﬁed
into the following categories: (1) classical—single HK and
RR gene pair with 0, 1, or 2 intervening genes; (2)
hybrid—identical to classical except a hybrid HK or
hybrid RR (see classiﬁcation rules above) is paired with
the RR and HK, respectively; (3) complex—two or more
two-component genes with no more than 0, 1, or 2
intervening genes; and (4) orphan—a single two-
component gene that is genomically isolated from any
other two-component genes.
While not based on a rigorous study of intergenic
distances, which are known to vary between species (23),
the 200 base pair threshold is intended as a simple, con-
servative cutoﬀ for establishing gene clusters and is similar
to those used in recent studies (24,25). Because gene
rearrangements and reshuﬄing frequently occur between
species (26), our approach permits neighboring two-
component genes in the same set to be separated by up
to two intervening genes.

genes (Figure 2). All proteins are visualized using their
domain architecture, and it is now possible to retrieve
the subsequence of speciﬁc domains by simply clicking
on the box surrounding a speciﬁc domain. The genomic
context of the current gene/protein being displayed is
visualized in the ‘‘Genome neighborhood’’ section and it
is possible to dynamically browse the chromosome/
plasmid (complete genomes) or contig (draft genomes)
using the mouse. Clicking on neighboring genes
transparently updates the annotation details and domain
architecture visualization. It is also possible to add or
remove the currently viewed gene from the gene cart
without leaving the page. We have added the capability
to retrieve upstream or downstream DNA of any gene.
MiST2 contains indices of external database identiﬁers
to the NCBI non-redundant protein database, Protein
Data Bank (27), and UniProt/SwissProt (28) database
enabling access to protein structures and additional
annotations. These facilitate ﬁnding proteins of interest
via custom searches and the complete list of cross-
references is displayed when viewing a speciﬁc protein/
gene.
Improved taxonomy browser and genome ﬁlters
We have completely overhauled the taxonomy browser
and selection tool. All genomes in MiST2 are hierarchi-
cally displayed according to their taxonomy and organized
with a user-speciﬁed taxonomy level. With the tree
it is possible to deﬁne multiple genome ﬁlters that enable
searching against speciﬁc user-deﬁned groups of genomes.
Changing the taxonomy level uses remote AJAX calls to
dynamically update the taxonomy tree. In addition to ﬁve
basic taxonomy levels—kingdom, phyla, class, order, and
family—we also provide a ‘‘Major taxonomic group’’ level
to facilitate viewing/selecting species at the phyla level and
all sublevels of the proteobacterial group.
Miscellaneous new features
MiST2 now supports searching by genome name,
taxonomy, MiST2 protein identiﬁer, locus tag, Refseq
gene name, Refseq description, Pfam and/or Agfam
domain architecture, and several classes of external
database identiﬁers (accession number, GI, SwissProt,
UniProt, and PDB). Users may incorporate Boolean
full-text logic to form more complex queries when
searching against the Refseq description and domain
architectures. By default queries are performed against
all available genomes, yet it is possible to narrow
searches to speciﬁc genomes of interest by specifying a
user-deﬁned genome ﬁlter (created using the taxonomy
browser). Available genome ﬁlters are displayed in the
scope drop-down box of the search panel (Figure 2).
The scope drop-down box on the summary page for a
speciﬁc genome automatically displays a genome ﬁlter
for the currently viewed genome for restricting searches
to this organism. Other improvements include the
addition of organism metadata (e.g. habitat, gram stain,
etc.), a gene/protein cart for retrieving gene and protein
sequences, ranking genomes by the number of hits
returned by the Google Scholar service (http://scholar.
google.com), a mailing list, and a completely redesigned,
biologist-friendly website. Every page includes the search
panel for rapidly ﬁnding relevant information and
breadcrumb navigation for keeping track of one’s
location.
DATABASE RESULTS
As of October 2009, MiST2 contains 245 521 signal
transduction proteins (Table 2). It has been previously
noted that one-component systems dominate prokaryotic
signal transduction (3) and our results based on the counts
from 1123 distinct genomes support this observation.
Indeed, if we estimate the number of two-component
systems based on the number of RR, one-component
systems outnumber two-component systems by a factor
of ﬁve. RRs slightly exceed the number of HKs (1.2:1),
yet this ratio approximates an even distribution when
compared to the combined number of HK and HHK.
The complex two-component proteins, HHK and HRR,
are far less abundant than HK and RR, respectively, sug-
gesting that most bacteria utilize simpler signaling
pathways. The nearly 1:1 ratio of the HK to RR occur-
rence strongly reinforces the notion that two-component
regulatory systems are not branched and typically link
a speciﬁc signal (or a set of signals in case of multiple
input domains) to a speciﬁc cellular response.
Archaea in general have lower counts of signal
transduction proteins than Bacteria. Phylogenetic (29)
and genomic (3) analyses suggest that two-component
systems have been laterally transferred to Archaea from
Bacteria. Therefore, the low counts of two-component
proteins in Archaea are not surprising; however,
peculiar observation is that Archaea contain signiﬁcantly
fewer HHK than expected (when normalized against
the total number of two-component proteins) and
signiﬁcantly more HRR (Table 2). This paradox
warrants a special consideration and experimental valida-
tion of the role of these hybrid proteins in the biology
of Archaea.
We classiﬁed 38 984 genomically neighboring two-
component proteins into the following categories: 31 040
(49%) classical, 1872 hybrid (3%), and 6072 (10%)
complex sets. The remainder did not neighbor any other
two-component protein. The majority (66%) of two-
component sets co-occurs with non-signaling proteins
and putatively regulates the expression of these neighbor-
ing genes or interact with their protein products.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PLANS
Because of their primary role in nearly all cellular pro-
cesses, knowledge of signal transduction proteins and
pathways will continue to be a driving force in furthering
biological discovery. MiST2 is the premier database on
microbial signal transduction. This second generation
database provides a comprehensive and well-deﬁned
system for extensively classifying and documenting the
major modes of signal transduction—one-component,
two-component, chemotaxis, and ECF—in both complete
Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, Database issue D405
and draft genomes. The modernized web interface of
MiST2 enables researchers to rapidly and conveniently
access relevant genomic data. We expect MiST2 to
continue building on its previous success as a valuable
tool for supporting microbiological research, genome
annotation, and applications for biomedical, environmen-
tal, and bioenergy research. We are currently analyzing the
signal transduction properties of metagenomic data sets
and will integrate these results into MiST2. Other
developments underway include building an orthologous
network of signaling domains, operon and signaling
pathway reconstruction, literature-based curation, and
continued website development.
