ABSTRACT. The reoccurring region of seasonal hypoxia in the central basin of Lake Erie (“the dead
zone”) has been of significant interest to researchers over the past several years. Surprisingly however,
no efforts to characterize the endemic microbial community, responsible for the consumption of oxygen in
this system, have been published. To understand how the microbial community may be interacting with
this event, we have begun to characterize microbial members by using molecular tools. Phycoerythrin-
rich cyanobacteria appear abundant and active in a narrow region (~ 1.5 m) below the thermocline dur-
ing hypoxic conditions, reaching abundances of greater than 105 mL–1 and being the primary agent
releasing 1.5 mg O2 L–1 above the daytime demands in this region. Sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons,
generated with universal eubacterial primer sets, from the Lake Erie’s hypolimnion during seasonal oxy-
gen depletion demonstrated that cyanobacteria, most closely related to phycoerythrin-rich Synechococ-
cus spp., dominate during rapid drawdown of oxygen (0.083 mg L–1 d–1 in 2004) in this region. Analyses
of another conserved marker of phylogeny (RuBisCO) has been used to confirm the presence of these cell
types. Numerous distinct taxa of heterotrophic bacteria are also represented in the 16S library. The
results of this study suggest that novel groups of cyanobacteria may persist within the Lake Erie dead
zone during hypoxic conditions and, along with the heterotrophic community, strongly influence system
geochemistry.

INTRODUCTION
The Laurentian Great Lakes are no doubt an im-
portant resource. With more than 30 million people
in their watershed, they are estimated to contain
~18% of the world’s potable water supply (Fuller et
al. 2002). Lake Erie, the smallest of these lakes, has
seen significant effects from the ~ 13 million resi-
dents that use it as a potable water supply as well as
a recreational and economic resource. During the
past several decades, alterations due to both anthro-
pogenic and natural factors have led to a renewed
interest in the function of this system. One specific
area of focus has been the seasonal hypoxia which
occurs in the central basin of this lake. The forma-
tion of this hypoxic region has been recognized for
over 30 years (Charlton and Milne 2004); recent
work however has suggested that changes within
658 Wilhelm et al.
the system (e.g., nutrient loading, lake level, clima-
tology) may be leading to an expansion of this so-
called dead zone.
Lake Erie is functionally divided into three sepa-
rate basins (denoted the western, central, and east-
ern basin). Hypoxia in the hypolimnetic region of
the central basin is primarily a function of lake
morphology: primary production in the central
basin fuels biological carbon export to a physically
constrained (1–4 m thick) hypolimnion, which
leads to the rapid drawdown of dissolved oxygen
when gas exchange is constrained by a stable ther-
mocline. Indeed, much of the formation of this hy-
poxic region can be explained by limnetic physics.
However, given that oxygen concentration in the
hypolimnion is a function of net oxygen consump-
tion (respiration > photosynthesis) it becomes nec-
essary to better understand the metabolic potential
of the microbial community. To address this, we
first must understand the composition and dynamics
of both the phototrophic and heterotrophic members
of this consortium. 
Insight into the microbial ecology of the Lake
Erie ecosystem seriously lags behind studies of
both coastal and offshore marine systems (e.g., De-
Long 1997) as well as many other lakes (e.g., Giri
et al. 2004). While historical information on the di-
versity and activity of nano- and microplankton
based on classic morphological studies are rife in
the literature, characterization of prokaryotic pi-
coplankton (e.g., Xu and Tabita 1996, Ouellette et
al. 2006) and heterotrophic prokaryotes—including
Archaea (Keough et al. 2003) are at best limited,
and generally constrained to estimates of abundance
(e.g., DeBruyn et al. 2004) and activity (Hwang and
Heath 1997, Wilhelm and Smith 2000). Indeed,
among these studies we are unaware of any infor-
mation on the genetic diversity of hypolimnetic
prokaryotic communities, which is potentially quite
different from surface populations. To this end we
felt that it was important to gain some insight into
the prokaryotic community structure of the central
basin hypolimnion during the transition to hypoxia.
As such phylogenetic analysis, based on the meta-
bolic capabilities of known microorganisms, is a
useful tool that can provide a first glimpse into the
biogeochemical potential of the community.
In this study we provide information on water
samples collected in 2002 which were used to gen-
erate a large 16S rDNA library. Results from this
work as well as from samples collected during re-
search cruises in 2003, 2004, and 2005 were ana-
lyzed and compared to physicochemical and
biological parameters collected in the central basin.
Conclusions drawn from these data provide a first
step toward understanding the critical linkage be-
tween oxygen producers and consumers in the cen-
tral basin hypolimnion.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Samples were collected during research cruises
on the CCGS Limnos in July 2002, 2003, 2004, and
2005 (Fig. 1—Map) using 10-L Niskin bottles
mounted on a rosette system. Details of water col-
umn structure and physiochemistry (temperature,
dissolved oxygen, transmissometry) were collected
with the ship’s CTD equipment at each location. In-
tegrated contour plots of temperature and oxygen
were generated from samples collected on 13 differ-
ent sampling dates (between 15 April and 13 Sep-
tember 2004) using SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat Software
Inc). Shifts in daily water column oxygen concen-
trations were determined from samples taken ~
hourly in August 2005 at station 84. Additional
casts were made with a SeaBird SBE-9 equipped
with a SeaTech fluorometer to characterize the ver-
tical distribution of chlorophyll a fluorescence. 
Nutrient Measurements
Nutrient concentrations (NO3– + NO2–, NO2–,
total dissolved [< 0.45-µm] nitrogen, total dissolved
[< 0.45-µm] phosphorus) were measured in whole
water samples. Measurements of nutrient concen-
tration were made at the National Laboratory for
Environmental Testing (Environment Canada)
using standardized techniques (NLET 1994). Sam-
ple pre-processing (filtration) was completed on the
ship and samples were stored at –20°C prior to
analysis.
Epifluorescent Enumeration of 
PE-rich Synechococcus
Total PE-rich Synechococcus were determined in
samples collected in July and August 2005 by direct
enumeration of autofluorescent cells as previously
described (Caron et al. 1985). In brief, cells from
10 mL of glutaraldehyde fixed samples (2% v/v,
final) were collected onto 25 mm-diameter, 0.20-
µm nominal pore-size black polycarbonate filters
and these filters mounted on glass slides. Cell den-
sities were determined using a Leica DMXRA epi-
fluorescence microscope: in each case at least 20
fields of view or 200 cells were enumerated for du-
plicate preparations of individual samples.

Microbial Community Structure
Samples (100 mL) for the analysis of microbial
community structure were collected onto 0.2-µm
polycarbonate filters by filtration and samples
stored at –20°C until analysis. High molecular
weight DNA was quantitatively extracted from fil-
ters as previously described (Rinta-Kanto et al.
2005). Sequence analysis for community diversity
was performed on a 2002 sample using universal
16S rDNA primer sets. PCR was performed using
universal eubacterial primers 46F (GCYTAACA-
CATGCAAGTCGA) (Kaplan et al. 2001) and 519R
(TTATTACCGCGGCKGCTG) (Lane 1991; W. Jef-
frey, pers. comm.), which amplify a fragment of the
16S rDNA gene (using the Escherichia coli num-
bering system) approximately 473 bases long. The
primer pair 46F and 536R (nearly identical to 519R
of Lane 1991) listed in Kaplan et al. (2001) has
been demonstrated to hybridize with 90% of 1,500
bacterial sequences tested (90% for 46F and 99%
for 519R). 
For the analysis of specific subgroups, PCR
primers specific to the Ribulose-1, 5-bisphophate
carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) large subunit
gene (rbcL) sequences (Bachoon et al. 2001) were
employed. For the quantification of cyanobacteria
16S rDNA genes in samples, the primers and Taq-
Man probe set described by Rinta-Kanto et al.
(2005) was employed. Samples were processed
using a MJ DNA Engine Opticon System (BioRad)
and standardized to the single copy plasmid stan-
dard previously described (Rinta-Kanto et al.
2005). 
Sequences for the 16S rDNA library were deter-
mined at the Clemson University Genomics Insti-
tute while sequences from rbcL were obtained from
the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee. Sequences have been de-
posited in GenBank under accession numbers
DQ167589 to DQ167722. 
After the removal of primers, sequences were
aligned with Clustal W (Thompson et al. 1994),
manually checked and edited in BioEdit (Hall
1999). BLAST analysis was conducted through the
NCBI website (Altschul et al. 1990) to compare in-
dividual sequences to known sequences. Neighbor-
joining analysis was conducted using Kimura
2-parameter distance and complete deletion, using
the Mega 3.1 software package (Kumar et al.
1994). Only positions that were unambiguous and
present for all sequences were utilized. Bootstrap-
ping employed 5,000 replications. Phylogenetic re-
constructions was also completed and bootstrapped
(100 iterations) using the Maximum Parsimony
analysis within the Mega 3.1 software package. 
RESULTS
Water Column Characteristics
Profiles of water column structure at master sta-
tion 84 in the central basin of Lake Erie, collected
FIG. 1. Location of stations within Lake Erie that were occupied for this study.
660 Wilhelm et al.
between 15 April and 26 August 2004, have al-
lowed for a reconstruction of the seasonal onset of
both stratification and hypoxia in the system (Fig.
2). As typical of our observations since 1998, ther-
mal stratification of the water column became ap-
parent by mid-June at both the master station (Sta.
84) and other stations in the central basin (data not
shown). Coupled with the onset of stratification,
water column oxygen levels decreased to hypoxic
(< 2 mg L–1) levels. Water column oxygen levels
returned to oxic by our 13 September 2004 sample
(data not shown). Water column thermal structure
had dissipated by this point and profiles of both
temperature and oxygen suggested a homogenously
mixed water column.
To characterize net oxygen consumption rates
during this period, mean hypolimnetic oxygen con-
centrations for the bottom 4 meters of water (up to
0.5 m from the sediments) were determined for
each cast (Fig. 3) and converted to percent satura-
tion based on direct estimates of temperature.
Analysis of the rate of decrease (vis a vis draw-
down) of oxygen concentrations suggested a net
oxygen consumption rate of 83 µg O2 L–1 d–1 (r2 =
0.977) during the 15 April to 26 August period. 
FIG. 2. Seasonal water column oxygen depletion in the central basin of Lake Erie during April–
September 2004. Water column oxygen profiles were used to generate integrated contour plots from data
collected on 13 separate dates for temperature (A.) and dissolved oxygen (B.) during the 2004 field season.

vides the same information with oxygen given in
concentration. These data were used to determine
the rate of net oxygen depletion, which was 0.083
mg L–1 d–1 (r2 = 0.977).

As well as considering the seasonal process of
net oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion, we
were also interested in diel variations that may be
occurring due to biological processes. Figure 4 il-
lustrates the analysis of one set of samples collected
during August 2005. The difference in dissolved
oxygen in water column profiles collected at ~ solar
noon (1:30 pm local time) and just at sunrise (6:00
am) was calculated to determine if oxygen produc-
tion in the water column was significant. As ex-
pected, water column oxygen production in the
epilimnion was significant, with the concentration
during the daytime being 0.5 mg L–1 higher than
the concentration at sunrise. Perhaps more interest-
ing, the oxygen concentration directly below the
thermocline was 2–2.3 mg L–1 higher during the
daytime, indicative of a rapidly photosynthesizing
population. Examinations of the rate of probe re-
sponse to changes in the water column oxygen sug-
gested that the probe could respond to net changes
of 4 mg L–1 within 0.5 m depth, (not shown) imply-
ing that these differences were not a function of in-
strument limitation. 
Cyanobacterial Abundance in the Water Column
Direct counts of Synechococcus from samples
collected in July and August 2005 demonstrate their
abundance in the water column (Table 1). Syne-
chococcus were consistently detected, with higher
abundances near the thermocline and in the hy-
polimnion relative to the epilimnion noted for sam-
ples collected during July. This distribution is
illustrated in Figure 5, where the peak in Syne-
chococcus direct counts corresponds with both the
fluorescence maximum in the hypolimnion as well
as the peak in oxygen production associated with
the base of the thermocline. 
FIG. 4. Differential oxygen concentrations between near solar noon (13:30) and
early morning (06:00). Significant increases in water column oxygen during daylight
hours are noted at ca 15 m. Water column thermal structure for both times (small inset
symbols) is also given to demonstrate water column stability during observations. 
662 Wilhelm et al.
As a separate line of evidence for cyanobacterial
abundance in the hypolimnion, we employed a
quantitative PCR approach for total cyanobacteria
with samples collected in 2004 (Fig. 6). This ap-
proach is independent of and not skewed by poten-
tial observational biases of a microscopist. As with
the direct count data, the cyanobacterial abundance
appears higher in the hypolimnion of the central
basin in July and August samples. Hypolimnetic
peaks were also observed in chlorophyll a fluores-
cence in the water column during these periods,
suggesting the presence of a significant picoplank-
ton community at depth (Fig. 6). 
Microbial Diversity—16S rDNA Library
As a first attempt to characterise the microbial
community from the central basin hypolimnion, we
cloned and sequenced multiple 16S rDNA ampli-
cons from DNA collected during O2 drawdown at
station 84 in July 2002. This sample was chosen
primarily due to a red discoloration associated with
the filter after collection of water samples at 18 m
depth. Lake Erie dead zone (LEDZ) sequences most
closely associated with heterotrophic and au-
totrophic prokaryotes were seen in this library. The
observation of filter discoloration and microscopic
counts (above) suggested that this region was domi-
nated by phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria,
which was confirmed using these molecular tools
(Fig. 7, Table 2) as 98 of the 134 sequences most
closely aligning with Synechococcus MH301, a PE-
rich cyanobacterium isolated from Lake Mondsee
(Crosbie et al. 2003). Among these, 33 identical se-
quences typified by LEDZ11 (accession number
DQ167597) as well as 16 identical sequences typi-
fied by LEDZ100 (accession number DQ167591)
represented > 36% of the total library. Additional
cyanobacterial LEDZ sequences fall within the pic-
ocyanobacterial clades defined by marine and fresh-
water Synechococcus spp. and Cyanobium spp.
(Fig. 7). Twelve other sequences clustered tightly
together with two other Synechococcus isolates
(BO9404 and MW10). Outside of the cyanobacteria
the amplicon sequences were most similar to a
broad range of heterotrophic bacteria having di-
verse metabolic capabilities (see Table 2). The taxo-
nomic classes represented are common to
freshwater aquatic environments and lake sedi-
ments, and likely contain facultative anaerobes ca-
pable of tolerating seasonal shifts in oxygen levels.
Within this group, most sequences had high ho-
mologies to known isolates of heterotrophic bacte-

ria. However, sequences which were most closely
related to sequences common to the environmental
genetic databases (uncultured actinobacter and un-
cultured planctomyces) were also found. 
Cyanobacterial Diversity—rbcL
The above data, combining phylogenetics with
qPCR and direct counts, indicated that a substantial
number of cyanobacteria may be present in the cen-
tral basin hypolimnion. As such we felt it prudent
to confirm their presence using an unrelated genetic
marker. Specifically, due to the phylogenetic affin-
ity of some 16S sequences to marine clade
cyanobacteria, we tested for the presence of se-
quences diagnostic for marine-like Synechococcus
spp. Sequence analysis was undertaken using
primers for the (RuBisCO) large subunit gene
(rbcL). Although only two sequences from the July
2002 sample were analyzed, the results clearly indi-
cate that the amplicons were from the marine form
1A cluster that also includes marine Synecho-
coccus, freshwater Cyanobium, and Prochlorococ-
cus (Fig. 8).
DISCUSSION
At the onset of this study we posed the following
question: Do the microbial communities of the
Lake Erie “dead zone” represent unique populations
that are active during periods of favorable dissolved
oxygen concentrations, or do they represent a meta-
FIG. 5. Profile from July 2005, demonstrating the distribution of
Synechococcus (determined by direct counts of autofluorescent cells
containing phycobilins). Peaks in water column chlorophyll a fluo-
rescence and hypolimnetic oxygen (determined on different profiling
instruments) coincide with the peak abundance of cells.

frequency of a single group of Synechococcus in the library. At nodes where dendrogram
structure was conserved, bootstrap values are given in the inset table for estimates using
neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) approaches. Other values are

Microbes in Lake Erie’s Dead Zone 667
FIG. 8. Phylogeny from Ribulose-1, 5-bisphophate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) large
subunit gene (rbcL) sequences. Neighbor-joining tree constructed from aligned amino acids
(138 residues). Results suggest that hypolimnetic populations of cyanobacteria in Lake Erie
have an affinity to the Synechococcus Marine Cluster and as such present a second line of
independent evidence that these Synechococcus are in the monophyletic marine group. At
nodes where dendrogram structure was conserved, bootstrap values are given in the inset
table for estimates using neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) approaches.
Other values are bootstrap values from NJ method with percentages < 50 removed.
bolically plastic group that undergoes biochemical
switches to compensate for dissolved oxygen lev-
els? The results of this study provide, for a first
time, insight into the phylogenetic profile of the mi-
crobial communities that persist during the devel-
opment of seasonal hypoxia in Lake Erie. Several
key observations, including the mixture of abundant
phototrophs with heterotrophic aerobes and faculta-
tive anaerobes, suggest that biogeochemical
processes in this system are tightly coupled—in-
deed the observations that significant populations
of oxygenic cyanobacteria persist in this region and
that oxygen is actively produced just below the
thermocline during hypoxia suggest that rapid oxy-
gen cycling must occur. This idea is supported by
the presence of obligate aerobes in the system in
spite of low levels of dissolved oxygen, and the
daily shift in oxygen concentration that we have
documented during high resolution profiling of the
water column. We discuss these preliminary obser-
668 Wilhelm et al.
vations below with respect to the potential role of
picocyanobacteria in the central basin hypolimnion. 
Hypolimnetic Oxygen Drawdown and Diel
Production in Lake Erie’s Central Basin
Significant interest in the popular press has fo-
cused on the seasonal formation of the “dead zone”
in Lake Erie. Somewhat a misnomer (but now an
accepted name), microbial activity is sufficient to
consume most of the oxygen in this constrained
volume of water within a few weeks of thermal
stratification: indeed the term “too alive” may be
more appropriate. As such, the central basin hy-
polimnion establishes the potential for a series of
unique metabolic activities to occur: sufficient light
for photosynthesis (especially in recent years as the
central basin has moved toward oligotrophic status
(Charlton and Milne 2004), combined with ample
inorganic nutrients and transient oxygen, estab-
lishes a series of possibilities for system metabo-
lism.
During our observations seasonal oxygen con-
sumption in the central basin occurred at a rate of
83 µg L–1 d–1 (0.11 mmol m–3 h–1). Given that the
hypolimnetic volume (i.e., < 20 m) of the central
basin of Lake Erie can be estimated at ca 2.03 ×
1010 m3 (W.M. Schertzer, personal communication),
this translates into a total consumption 5.35 × 107
mol O2 d–1 in the central basin hypolimnion. One
assumption is that the majority of this oxygen de-
mand is driven by the vertical transport of epilim-
netic produced carbon into the hypolimnion.
Estimates for primary production rates in the epil-
imnion vary dependent on the method used to make
them, but are more than sufficient (ca 0.1–90 mM
O2 m–3 h–1 ) across a volume of 2.9 × 1011 m3 (as-
suming the volume above 20 m) or 2.4 × 1011 m3
(assuming the volume above 15 m) to provide this
much carbon (Ostrom et al. 2004). It should be
noted that at least some of this primary production
is potentially exported laterally to the eastern basin
of the Lake (Boegman et al. 2001) or consumed by
the active microbial community in the epilimnion
while being vertically exported (DeBruyn et al.
2004). Regardless, the excess of epilimnetic C pro-
duction suggests that O2 produced in the hy-
polimnion by photosynthetic organisms may never
accumulate, as primary production settling into this
confined system will fuel bacterial oxygen con-
sumption.
To determine if there was a diel signature in hy-
polimnetic oxygen production, we carried out a se-
ries of hourly profiles of oxygen concentrations in
the water column to see if we could detect hypolim-
netic oxygen production. In previous years we had
noticed a small but consistent increase in oxygen
concentration just below the thermocline during the
daytime, and this was apparent again during the
July cruise at ca 15 m (see Fig. 5). To determine the
potential effect of this production, we wanted to de-
termine whether significant oxygen could accumu-
late during the daytime (when photosynthesis
would occur). To do this we determined the differ-
ence in solar noon water column oxygen concentra-
tion relative to early morning (pre-sunrise) oxygen
concentrations (bacterial activity through the night
should have significantly depleted oxygen concen-
trations). One concern with this approach is in the
calibration of equipment between profiles: indeed it
could be argued that the 0.5 mg L–1 higher oxygen
concentrations in the epilimnion during the daytime
sampling relative to the pre-sunrise sampling may
represent a calibration error. If we assume this
though, there was still an enhancement of oxygen
concentrations across 1.5 m of depth (from ca
15–16.5 m, Fig. 4) above and beyond the surface
difference. Averaged across the cross-sectional area
of the lake’s central basin for these depths (a vol-
ume of 1.25 × 1010 m3, W.M. Schertzer, personal
communication) this would represent a production
of 1.875 × 1013 mg (18,750 tonnes) of O2 above the
demand in this region that would be available to the
rest of the hypolimnion via diffusion, or within this
region after sunset. As such, not only does this in-
formation represent an important insight for those
interested in modeling Lake Erie physiochemistry,
it also suggests the presence of an active photosyn-
thetic population.
Cyanobacteria in the Hypoxic Hypolimnion—
Three Lines of Evidence
Perhaps the most significant result of this study is
the demonstration that a significant population of
cyanobacteria persist within a thin layer at the inter-
face of the thermocline and hypolimnion of the cen-
tral basin. Indeed, the high percentage of
cyanobacterial 16S rDNA sequences within the en-
tire library during the onset of hypolimnetic hy-
poxia in 2002 strongly suggested that hypoxia
stimulates the establishment of the picocyanobacte-
rial deep chlorophyll layer. As evidenced by fluoro-
metric profiles and direct counts, it appears that the
majority of these cells are constrained to a narrow
band that persists just below the thermocline. At
Microbes in Lake Erie’s Dead Zone 669
this depth the low level of PAR (ca 1% of ambient)
combined with ample inorganic nutrients from the
mineralization of carbon exported from the surface
could drive this community. During the drawdown
of oxygen, we have observed historically a decrease
in ambient nitrate and an increase in ammonium
that could fuel this population of cells. For exam-
ple, during the 2004 field season dissolved NH4+
concentrations in the hypolimnion of sta. 84 (1.41
µM) and sta. 916 (2.17 µM) exceed surface values
by ca 2.2-fold (0.65 and 1.00 µM, respectively). In
contrast the nitrate concentrations were 0.55- to
0.76-fold lower in the hypolimnion than in surface
waters. As such, the NH4+: NO3 ratio in the hy-
polimnion (0.6–0.9) may favor NH4+ assimilation
while the NH4+: NO3 ratio in the epilimnion of
these stations (0.2–0.3) would likely favor NO3 as-
similation. This is in contrast to station 23 in the
eastern basin. With a fully oxygenated hy-
polimnion, NO3 concentration was higher in the hy-
polimnion than surface waters (5.37 µM vs. 3.68
µM) while the ammonium concentration was in-
verse (1.59 µM in the hypolimnion vs. 2.11 µM in
the epilimnion). Given evidence that some
cyanobacteria (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus
spp., Moore et al. 2002) cannot use nitrate, changes
in water column N speciation might drive commu-
nity shifts during the onset of seasonal hypoxia.
Numerically, PE-rich Synechococcus were abun-
dant in samples analyzed by epifluorescence, rang-
ing from 103–105 cells per mL in our samples. The
overall abundance of cyanobacteria (which would
also include phycocyanin rich and filamentous
strains not included in the above estimate) was also
high, with > 105 copies of their 16S rDNA gene se-
quence detected by quantitative PCR during visits
to two sites in 2004. Given that most picoplank-
tonic genomes completed to date in GenBank con-
tain ca 2–3 copies of the 16S rDNA gene, the total
genomic equivalents (i.e., cell densities) in our
samples is on par with that measured for total
cyanobacteria using this approach in other studies
(e.g., Becker et al. 2002).
Heterotrophic Prokaryotes in the Central Basin
Hypolimnion—Preliminary Insight
Given the predominance of cyanobacterial se-
quences in our data set, we are left with only a min-
imal number of sequences which represent the
heterotrophic prokaryotes in this system. During
our 2002 sampling, water column oxygen was at ca
70% saturation: as such we expected a mix of aero-
bic and facultative anaerobic microbes which we
anticipated would be driving oxygen consumption.
One potential problem with this hypothesis is that it
excludes the role of benthic microbes in the con-
sumption of hypolimnetic oxygen—indeed, it has
previously been suggested that the activity of mi-
crobes in the sediment may be sufficient to account
for the consumption of the hypolimnetic oxygen
(Leutheuser 1979). 
Among the sequences, perhaps the most intrigu-
ing is the presence of a sequence indicative of of a
Planctomycetales-related clone in the sample.
Members of this phylogenetic group have been pre-
viously demonstrated to be capable of a series of
novel biogeochemical reactions, including the abil-
ity to oxidize ammonia under anaerobic conditions
(Strous et al. 1999). This process requires both am-
monia and nitrite in an anaerobic environment, re-
sulting in the production of dinitrogen gas (Strous
et al. 1997). Although the ANAMMOX reaction
still remains a novel observation in natural systems,
similar studies, citing conditions of low oxygen and
abundant ammonia and nitrite, have suggested the
presence of these organisms and the potential for
this process to occur (Mills et al. 2004). Indeed,
ammonia oxidation to N2 may in part explain why
Lake Erie has not seen the accumulation of dis-
solved nitrogen (presumably due to anthropogenic
effects) that has been observed in Lake Superior
(Ivanikova et al. 2005).
Yet another interesting cluster of sequences
(LEDZ 19 and LEDZ 174) appears to be closely re-
lated to a Terrabacter sp. Organisms in this group
have been shown to de able to metabolize chlori-
nated-aromatic compounds (Aislabie et al. 1999).
These anthropogenic compounds have been histori-
cally shown to accumulate in the Laurentian Great
Lakes, including Lake Erie (Czuczwa and Hites
1986). Research has demonstrated that two distinct
processes (one aerobic and one anaerobic) are in-
volved in the breakdown of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) (Abramowicz 1995). Anaerobic
PCB dechlorination, has been shown to convert
highly chlorinated PCBs to lightly chlorinated
ortho-enriched congeners. The products from this
anaerobic process are then readily degradable by a
wide range of aerobic bacteria. As such, the pres-
ence of the Terrabacter-like sequences and those of
other potential PCB biotransformers (J.L. Bouzat,
pers. com.) suggest that the aerobic / anaerobic cy-
cling within the central basin during seasonal hy-
poxia may indeed play a role in the natural
bioremediation of anthropogenic contaminants.
670 Wilhelm et al.
Moreover, the production of trace amounts of oxy-
gen by oxygenic phototrophs (vis a vis the abun-
dance cyanobacteria we have identified) suggests
that during seasonal hypoxia there may be a suffi-
cient redox gradient within the hypolimnetic water
column for these processes to occur simultaneously.
Whereas this remains hypothetical at this point, it
obviously begs the need for further study of the mi-
crobial community both before and during seasonal
hypoxia.
