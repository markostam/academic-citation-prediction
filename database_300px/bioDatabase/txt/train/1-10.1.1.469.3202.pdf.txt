[1] It is well established that the temperature gradients in the interiors of internally heated
mantle convection models are subadiabatic. The subadiabatic gradients have been
explained as arising because of a balance between vertical advection and internal heating;
however, a detailed analysis of the energy balance in the subadiabatic regions has not been
undertaken. In this paper, we examine in detail the energy balance in a suite of simple,
two-dimensional convection calculations with mixed internal and basal heating, depth-
dependent viscosity, and continents. We find that there are three causes of subadiabatic
gradients. One is the above mentioned balance, which becomes significant when the ratio
of internal heating to total surface heat flow is large. The second mechanism involves
the growth of the ‘‘overshoot’’ of the geotherm near the lower boundary where the
dominant balance is between vertical and horizontal advection. The latter mechanism is
significant even in relatively weakly internally heated calculations. For time-dependent
calculations, we find that local secular cooling can be a dominant term in the energy
equation and can lead to subadiabaticity. However, it does not show its signature on the
shape of the time-averaged geotherm. We also compare the basal heat flow with
parameterized calculations based on the temperature drop at the core-mantle boundary,
calculated both with and without taking the subadiabatic gradient into account, and we
find a significantly improved fit with its inclusion.

1. Introduction
[2] It is often assumed that the temperature profile in the
Earth’s mantle outside of thermal boundary layers is close to
adiabatic due to the dominance of advective heat transfer
[e.g., Schubert et al., 2001]. However, numerical simula-
tions of convection scaled to the Earth’s mantle have shown
that in the presence of internal heating, which models the
effects of radioactive decay, the temperature increases with
depth more slowly than would be predicted assuming adia-
baticity [e.g., McKenzie et al., 1974; Sotin and Labrosse,
1999; Matyska and Yuen, 2000; Bunge et al., 2001]. Sleep
[2003] and Bunge [2005] have estimated that the tempera-
ture increase from the base of the surface thermal boundary
layer to the top of the basal thermal boundary layer is less,
by roughly 400 K, than would be predicted if the mantle
temperature profile were purely adiabatic. However, Zhong
[2006] argues for only 180 K. This has significant con-
sequences for estimates of the composition of the mantle
[Mattern et al., 2005] as well as for mantle transport
properties [Monnereau and Yuen, 2002]. The presence of
a subadiabatic thermal gradient in the mantle would also
lead to a greater temperature drop across the core-mantle
boundary (CMB), that would increase estimates of the heat
flow in this region [Bunge, 2005]. An increase in the
estimated heat flow at the CMB would, in turn, be of
significance in determining the energy budgets for the
mantle and core and would imply a young inner core
[e.g., Butler et al., 2005; Davies, 2007].
[3] Jeanloz and Morris [1987] presented a physical
argument for the existence of a subadiabatic gradient in
the interior of purely internally heated convecting systems.
They assumed that subadiabatic gradients arise due to the
balance between internal heating and vertical advection, and
because of the asymmetry between upwellings and downw-
ellings in internally heated flows. This argument, and
similar ones [Sleep, 2003; Bunge, 2005] have been used
to explain the existence of the subadiabatic gradient
observed in internally heated convection models. It is also
well known that an ‘‘overshoot’’ is often seen inside thermal
boundary layers in the horizontally averaged internal tem-
perature in convection models [e.g., McKenzie et al., 1974;
Blankenbach et al., 1989], which occurs because vertical
flows are forced to turn horizontally at the top and bottom
boundaries. The inside of these overshoots also correspond
to regions of subadiabatic gradients. We will also show that
the basal overshoot becomes more pronounced as internal
heating is increased, making a significant contribution to the
total subadiabatic gradient.

[4] Another mechanism causing regions of subadiabticity
is only present when convection is time-dependent. Every
transient plume has superadiatatic and subadiabatic regions
[Matyska and Yuen, 2002]. Although this mechanism is
significant, its effects on a time-averaged geotherm are very
similar to those of the other two mechanisms. In section 2
we present in greater detail how these mechanisms can
result in subadiabatic temperature gradients, and in section 5
we examine in detail the energy balance in regions of
subadiabaticity in order to determine the relative importance
of each mechanism.
[5] Depth-dependent viscosity [e.g., Gurnis and Davies,
1986; Cserepes, 1993; Bunge et al., 1996] and the thermal
effects of continents [e.g., Guillou and Jaupart, 1995;
Lenardic et al., 2005] are significant factors affecting
convective heat transport in the mantle. In sections 6 and
7, we analyze the effects of depth-dependent viscosity and
different surface boundary conditions, representing the
effects of continents, on mantle subadiabaticity.
[6] Sotin and Labrosse [1999] presented a series of
calculations with mixed basal and internal heating and were
able to achieve excellent agreement with a parameterized
model for the average temperature and surface heat flow.
The CMB heat flow could not be calculated in their
parameterized model based on the interior temperature,
however, and they argued that the subadiabatic gradient in
the lower mantle would need to be taken into account in
order to achieve such an agreement. In section 9 we
demonstrate that an improved fit is achieved when the
subadiabatic gradient is considered.
2. Mechanisms Resulting in Subadiabatic
Gradients
[7] In order to achieve the greatest possible simplicity, we
consider an incompressible Boussinesq system. The tem-
perature, T, in the energy equation can then be considered as
an approximation for the potential temperature in a com-
pressible system [Jarvis and McKenzie, 1980], where we
have neglected the terms due to thermal conduction along
the adiabat as well as viscous dissipation, which are
generally small. Using this approximation, when the tem-
perature is constant with height, we will consider the system
to be adiabatic. When temperature increases or decreases
with height, the system is then said to be subadiabatic or
superadiabatic, respectively. The nondimensional equation
governing the temperature, T, is then
 @T
@t
 u @T
@x
 w @T
@z
þr2T þ H ¼ 0; ð1Þ
where t, u, w and H are time, horizontal and vertical velocity
and the rate of change of temperature due to internal
heating, respectively. The terms in the equation (from left to
right) represent the addition of heat to an infinitesimal
volume by local secular cooling, horizontal advection,
vertical advection, diffusion and internal heating, respec-
tively. The equation has been nondimensionalized using
scales for distance, d, time, d2/k, and temperature change,
DT, where d, k and DT are the depth, thermal diffusivity
and the total temperature drop across the mantle, respec-
tively. The resulting nondimensional internal heating
parameter, H, is then (cd2r)/(DTk) where c, r and k are
the internal heating rate per unit mass, density and thermal
conductivity of mantle material, respectively. In all of our
calculations, we have run the models to a steady state, or
statistically steady state, so that the volume-averaged local
secular cooling term is small. This term could also be
combined with H to give an effective internal heating rate.
However, we will show that in time-dependent calculations,
the local secular cooling term is often locally a dominant
term in the energy balance even when its volume-average is
minimal.
[8] Jeanloz and Morris [1987] presented a physical
argument for the existence of a subadiabatic temperature
gradient in purely internally heated convective systems.
They assumed that the horizontal contribution to advection
and diffusion are negligible everywhere except within the
boundary layers. This leaves a balance between vertical
advection and internal heating,
w
@T
@z
¼ H : ð2Þ
Since H is always positive in regions of upwelling (w > 0),
the temperature gradient will be subadiabatic (@T/@z > 0),
while in regions of downwelling the temperature gradient
will be superadiabatic. Physically, heat is added by internal
heating to both hot rising and cold sinking parcels of fluid,
leading to subadiabatic and superadiabatic temperature
variations. Note that the deviation from a state where @T/
@z = 0 decreases with the magnitude of the vertical velocity
for a given value of H. For this reason, in fast moving slabs
and plumes, the temperature gradient predicted by this
model is close to adiabatic. In internally heated convection,
the effects of subadiabatic upwellings and superadiabatic
downwellings will not cancel out when the temperature is
averaged horizontally due to the asymmetry between
upwelling and downwelling in internally heated convection.
In the presence of strong internal heating, downwelling
occurs in narrow, high-velocity regions while upwellings
travel at a much lower speed and occur over a much wider
horizontal distance [e.g., Jarvis and Peltier, 1982]. As a
result of the greater area that the upwellings cover and
because they are strongly subadiabatic, while the down-
wellings are only weakly superadiabatic, the mean tem-
perature variation with depth will be subadiabatic.
[9] In order to quantify the magnitude of this effect for
the Earth, we can consider the potential temperature in a
rising parcel of fluid where the energy balance is given by
equation (2). For the Earth, the total surface heat flow is
roughly 44 TW [Pollack et al., 1993], of which roughly
8 TW comes from radioactivity in the continental crust
[Hart and Zindler, 1986] resulting in 36 TW of power
coming from convection in the mantle. If all of this is
attributed to the combined effects of internal heating and
secular cooling within the mantle (i.e., there is no flux of
heat from the core), we can calculate an upper bound for
Heff = (ctotd
2r)/(MDTk) = 30.5. Here we have combined
secular cooling and internal heating to give an effective
internal heating, Heff, and ctot = 36 TW and M are the total
internal heating rate and total mass of the mantle (4 
1024 kg), and we have used typical mantle values for r =
4500 kg/m3,DT = 3700 K and k = 3 W/mK [Schubert et al.,
B10406 SINHA AND BUTLER: MANTLE SUBADIABATIC GRADIENT

2001]. Using equation (2), we can derive an expression for
the total subadiabatic temperature drop for a fluid parcel
rising at a constant speed, w0, with an energy addition given
at a rate controlled by H and inverting this for w0 gives, w0 =
H/DTsub. In order to have a subadiabatic temperature drop
that is at least 10% of the total temperature drop across the
mantle, we require a nondimensional mean vertical velocity
of no more than w0 = 305 or 0.18 cm/yr after dimension-
alizing. This value is roughly less by a factor of 20 than the
mean plate velocity of 4 cm/yr. As a result, the slow upward
return flow must be significantly slower than the flows in
mantle plumes or descending slabs for this mechanism to be
significant. We will show it is only large in calculations with
large values of H and we will refer to this mechanism
hereafter as B1. Also, using our numerical results, we will
demonstrate that the balance given in equation (2) is not the
only mechanism that causes mantle subadiabaticity.
[10] Another situation where regions of subadiabatic
temperature gradients are observed, occur even in purely
basally heated convection. Temperature overshoots often
occur just inside the top and bottom thermal boundary
layers where subadiabatic gradients occur on the interior
of these overshoots. They occur because vertical flows are
forced to turn due to of the presence of the top and bottom
boundaries. In the subadiabatic portions of the overshoot the
dominant energy balance is between the vertical and hori-
zontal contributions to advection [Jarvis and Peltier, 1982].
McKenzie et al. [1974] showed examples of increased
overshoot at the bottom boundary and decreased overshoot
at the top boundary when internal heating was increased. In
their study of convection with mixed internal and basal
heating, Sotin and Labrosse [1999] observed that a small
degree of internal heating resulted in the disappearance of
the overshoot at the upper thermal boundary layer. We
further investigate the increasing asymmetry between the
top and bottom overshoots and their cause in section 5. This
overshoot mechanism will be referred to hereafter as B2.
[11] When the calculation is time-dependent another
mechanism, the balance between local secular cooling and
the other terms in the energy equation, becomes significant.
This mechanism remains significant in the energy balance at
a given location, even after the model is run to a statistical
steady state. However, it does not make large changes to the
time-averaged geotherm. This mechanism only replaces B1
and B2 and as a result the geotherm is not significantly
affected by it. As an example, if the subadiabatic gradient
due to the overshoot is displaced up or down by transient
flow, the local secular cooling will be one of the dominant
terms in the energy equation. From now on we will refer to
this mechanism as B3.
3. Numerical Model Description
[12] We solve equation (1) and the infinite Prandtl num-
ber Navier-Stokes equations using the finite difference
method on 289  289, 1153  289 and 2305  289 grids
in 1  1, 4  1 and 8  1 boxes, respectively. The
calculations for Ra = 108 were carried out with a resolution
of 1153  1153. The Navier-Stokes equations were con-
verted to a stream function vorticity pair of Poisson’s
equations, which were solved using MUDPACK [Adams,
1991].
[13] Some of our models included the effect of a jump in
viscosity at a nondimensional height of 0.77, which is
appropriate to 670 km depth in the mantle. We have plotted
the vertical viscosity profile with depth in Figure 1. We use
the following equation to describe the vertical variation in
viscosity, m:
m zð Þ ¼ mj  1
2
 
tanh l z670  zð Þ½ 	 þ
mj þ 1

 
; ð3Þ
where mj is the total jump in the viscosity and l is a width
parameter which we take to have a value of 50.
[14] In models that include the effects of continental
lithosphere, an insulating layer of thickness hc is placed
on the top of the solution domain. It is assumed that the heat
flow at the base of the continental lithosphere is the same as
the heat flow at the surface and the mechanism of heat
transport in the continent is purely conductive. If we take
the mantle and the continental thermal conductivities to be
equal:
Ts  Tb
hc
¼ @T
@z

z¼1
; ð4Þ
where Ts and Tb are the temperatures at the surface and the
base of the continental lithosphere and we evaluate @T/@z at
the base of the continent. We solve for Tb at each time step
and at each horizontal position beneath the continent as it
serves as the top boundary temperature for that part of the
mantle that is covered by a continent. Oceanic and
continental regions are modeled as free slip and no slip,
respectively.
[15] In order to implement mixed surface dynamical
boundary conditions, we iterate the solution using the
following expression for the surface vorticity:
wnþ1 ¼ 0:5 tanh a x x1ð Þð Þ þ tanh a x2  xð Þð Þ½ 	f g wn  b unð Þ;
ð5Þ
where n is an iteration index, a describes the thickness of
the transition between the free-slip region and the no-slip

region, x1 and x2 define the horizontal extent of the
continent, b is empirically chosen so as to give rapid
convergence and un is the surface velocity as of the nth
iteration step.
[16] All of the boundaries have zero mass flux, while the
sidewalls are reflecting and free slip. The bottom boundary
(CMB) is also free slip and kept isothermal with a constant
nondimensional temperature T = 1 and except for the
models with a conducting lid, the isothermal top surface
is kept at a nondimensional temperature of T = 0.

maximum temperatures along the geotherm outside the
thermal boundary layers, Tmin and Tmax, average tempera-

tion and internal heating, vertical and horizontal advection,
and conduction and internal heating, respectively. We only
list the most important energy balances in Table 2, so the
numbers do not sum to 100%. The quantity Asub indicates
the area of the domain with a positive temperature gradient.
These terms are time-averaged when the solutions are time-
dependent.
[18] In section 5 we analyze a number of simple calcu-
lations to determine where subadiabatic temperature gra-
dients occur and the exact balance in the energy equation
where they do. The effects of depth-dependent viscosity are
discussed in section 6. We then consider the effects of
subadiabaticity on the CMB heat flow, and in section 10 we
discuss our results in the context of thermal convection in
the Earth’s mantle.
5. Numerical Model Results
[19] In Figure 2 we show results of calculation M13, run
with Ra = 105 and H = 10, where the ratio of internal
heating to total heat flow (Urey ratio) is 0.77. We first
consider this calculation with a relatively low Rayleigh
number and unit aspect ratio because of the clarity afforded
by displaying results that consist of only one convective roll
in the absence of boundary layer instabilities. Figure 2a
displays the steady state temperature field, while in
Figure 2b we display a filled color contour plot indicating
Figure 2. Results from calculation M13 with Ra = 105 and H = 10: (a) temperature field and balance in
the different terms of the energy equation (colors) (b) together with the positive part of the vertical
temperature gradient (contours). Color bar: 1, local secular cooling and vertical advection; 2, local secular

the dominant balance between different terms of the energy
equation at each point within the box. The filled contours
are overlain by a line contour plot of the positive part of the
vertical derivative of the temperature. Every integer value in
the balance plot indicates a particular dominant balance
between two different terms in the energy equation
(described in Figure 2 caption). In order to maintain a
consistent color scheme we use the same color bar for all
plots of this type. As can be seen, and as is characteristic of
strongly internally heated convection, the flow field is
strongly asymmetric with a narrow region of rapid downw-
elling on the left-hand side of the box and slow upward flow
occurring over the rest of the domain. The geotherm for this
calculation can be seen in Figure 3a. The broad bottom
overshoot in the geotherm is caused by the large area of
positive vertical temperature gradient associated with the
dominant balance between vertical and horizontal advec-
tion, B2 (shown as green in Figure 2b). In models without
internal heating, symmetric overshoots are seen adjacent to
the top and bottom thermal boundary layers.
[20] Matyska and Yuen [2002] reported similar subadia-
baticity above regions where cold, avalanche material had
ponded at the base of a simulation with phase transitions
and temperature-dependent viscosity. In calculation M13
the upwelling at the top boundary is very broad and the
ambient temperature is essentially the same as the temper-
ature in the upwelling, resulting in very little horizontal
advection of heat and hence no overshoot. The cross-like
pattern in Figure 2b, which can be seen in the regions where
diffusion and internal heating are balancing one another,
occurs at the center of the convection roll, where vertical
and horizontal velocities are 0. Within much of the slow
upward return flow the dominant balance in the energy
equation is between internal heating and vertical advection
(B1), that leads to the broad area of low-amplitude positive
thermal gradient (shown as orange in Figure 2b). Although
the positive gradient associated with the overshoot at the
base of this calculations appears to make a larger contribu-
tion to the subadiabatic gradient, the data in Table 2 indicate
that mechanisms B1 and B2 make similar contributions to
the total subadiabatic temperature variation.
[21] In Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c we show time-averaged
geotherms calculated from simulations with Ra = 105 (M5,
M7, M9, M11 and M13) and 107 (M49, M50, M51, M52,
M53, M54 and M55) in a 1  1 box and Ra = 106 (M16,
M18, M23, M42, M45 and M47) in a 4  1 box,
respectively, with different degrees of internal heating.
The time-averaged geotherms for Ra = 105 with different
H in a 4  1 box looked very similar to the ones in a 1 
1 box. Because of the mechanism described in the previous
paragraph, as the degree of internal heating is increased, the
surface overshoot decreases in magnitude and then disap-
pears as the lower overshoot increases. It can also be seen
that at Ra = 107 the geotherm interior to the overshoot and
top thermal boundary is close to adiabatic for values of H up
to roughly 20 whereupon B1 and B3 mechanisms start to
cause significantly subadiabatic interior gradients. This
phenomenon can be observed for calculations with values
of H = 10 and higher when Ra = 106. B2 makes up a
decreasing fraction of the subadiabatic gradient in the
models as internal heating is increased. This phenomenon
can be seen in Table 2 for the set of calculations with Ra = 105

and increasing H (M5, M7, M9, M11 and M13), where the
value for B2 decreases from 71% to 44% and B1 increases
from 0 to 40% as the amount of internal heating is
increased. Also, the scaled value of Tsub increases from
296 K to 592 K, assuming a temperature drop DT = 3700 K
[Boehler, 2000]. The models with Ra = 106 show time
dependence, indicated by the higher values of B3, but
overall, the percentage of the total subadiabatic gradient
due to mechanism B2 decreases with increasing H while B1
increases. All of the models for Ra = 107 (M49, M50, M51,
M52, M53, M54 and M55) are strongly time-dependent and
as a result, the most significant energy balance is due to
mechanism B3. Mechanisms B1 and B2 show similar trends
as those seen for lower Rayleigh number calculations, but
these are not as clear due to the dominance of B3. For higher
Rayleigh numbers or when the calculation is time-dependent,
B3 acts very much like B1 and B2, concealing their effects.
[22] Figures 4a and 4b show the temperature snapshot
and the energy balance plot corresponding to the same time
instant, for a Rayleigh number of 106 and H = 3 (M18). The
blue color in the balance plots indicates time dependence
(B3). In Table 2 the time-averaged value for mechanism B3
shows that it is responsible for 60% of the subadiabatic
gradient for calculation M18, while B2 accounts for 35%
and corresponds to the green color near the CMB, in the
regions of high subadiabaticity. B1 (shown as orange in the
balance plots) is almost insignificant in M18 because of
the low internal heating, but it accounts for 16% of
the subadiabatic gradient in model M47, which is almost
entirely internally heated. We have not shown a similar plot
for calculations with Ra = 107 or 108 because the complex,
short-wavelength patterns make these plots very difficult to
interpret visually.
[23] Figures 5a and 5b show the magnitude of the sub-
adiabatic temperature drop, Tsub, and the area of the domain
with positive temperature gradient, Asub, with increasing
Urey ratio (ratio of the internal heating to the surface heat
flow) for Ra = 105 (M6, M8, M10, M12 and M14) and 106
(M16, M18, M21, M23, M42, M45 and M47) in a 4 
1 box, and 107 (M49, M50, M51, M52, M53, M54 and
M55) in a 1  1 box. Tsub clearly increases with increasing
Urey ratio and decreases as the Rayleigh number is increased,
however, no scaling could be found. As can be seen in
Figure 5, models with Ra = 105, 106 and 107 have values of
Asub close to 50% up to a Urey ratio of roughly 60%
whereupon Asub increases suddenly.
6. Effects of Depth-Dependent Viscosity
[24] We ran simulations with a surface Rayleigh number
of Ra = 106 with H = 0 and 10 and specified total increases
of mj = 10 and 100 in viscosity (M1, M3, M25 and M27).
Because of the very low effective Rayleigh number when
we use mj = 100 and H = 0 (M1) the interior of the geotherm
was subadiabatic (not shown). Jarvis and Peltier [1982]
showed in their basally heated constant viscosity calcula-
tions that the geotherm is subadiabatic for Rayleigh numb-
ers between 5 to almost 100 times the critical value. Our
analysis shows that the subadiabaticity in these cases is
caused by mechanism B2. We ran another set of models with
increased surface Rayleigh numbers such that the surface
heat flow was close to the same for the models with depth-
dependent and constant viscosity in order to be able to
compare models with the same effective Rayleigh number.
[25] In Figure 6 we plot the time-averaged geotherms
from calculations with almost identical effective Rayleigh
numbers, H = 10 and viscosity increases of mj = 1, 10 and
100 (M22, M26 and M28). The average temperature
decreases as we increase the total viscosity jump, because
a larger temperature drop is required at the CMB when the
basal thermal boundary layer becomes thicker due to the
increased viscosity [Butler and Peltier, 2000]. Note that as
Figure 4. (a) Temperature field and (b) corresponding energy balance plot overlain by the contour lines
of the positive part of the vertical temperature gradient for calculation with Ra = 106 and H = 3 (M18).

B10406
the viscosity jump increases, the surface overshoot reap-
pears and becomes more pronounced while the lower
overshoot becomes broader. The reappearance of the surface
overshoot in the presence of internal heating is caused by the
lower average temperature in the case of depth-dependent
viscosity and the greater mobility near the surface. Both of
these factors enhance the horizontal advection of heat
leading to a surface overshoot due to the mechanism B2.
However, if the effective Rayleigh number is kept the same,
depth-dependent viscosity does not lead to a significant
change in the total subadiabaticity.
7. Effects of Surface Boundary Conditions
[26] Figure 7 shows the geotherms from models with a
Rayleigh number of 106 and H = 10 calculated with
different surface boundary conditions including free slip,
no slip, and no slip with a conducting lid of thickness 0.04
(dimensionally 116 km), as well as models with mixed free
slip and conducting lid boundary conditions in a 1  1 box
(M22, M29, M32, M35 and M38). We also conducted
similar calculations in higher aspect ratio (4 and 8) boxes
and the time-averaged geotherms looked very similar. The
models with a stagnant lid on the top (e.g., no slip or no slip
with a conducting lid) may be especially applicable to
Venus and Mars [e.g., Reese et al., 1998; Solomatov and
Moresi, 1996; Stevenson, 2003]. In models where the
continental length is 0.4 (M32, M33 and M34) the continent
is in the middle and for models with continental length 0.3
(M29, M30 and M31) it is at the left of the box. In the case
when the surface is entirely covered by a conducting lid the
mantle transports heat into the core because of its very high
internal temperature, otherwise, all the geotherms show
subadiabaticity with an overshoot at the bottom. Note that
putting the conducting lid on the left or in the middle of the
box does not make much difference as shown by the
geotherm plots in Figure 7. The values in Table 2 show
that when the surface is changed to no slip from free slip the
subadiabatic contribution due to B2 decreases from 62% to
42% and further decreases to only 2% when the entire
surface is covered by a conducting lid. On the other hand
the total contribution due to the mechanism B1 increases
from 4% to 36% indicating that mechanism B1 becomes
more important when a stagnant lid is in place. Although the
mechanism causing the subadiabaticity changes, the data in
Table 1 show that the total magnitude of the subadiabatic
temperature drop, Tsub, is not significantly affected by the
surface boundary condition in a unit aspect ratio box. In
section 8 we discuss the effects due to larger aspect ratio
boxes.
8. Effects of Aspect Ratio
[27] In larger aspect ratio boxes, solutions become more
time-dependent and as a result, B3 becomes increasingly
important as a mechanism causing subadiabaticity as can be
seen in the results listed in Table 2. The data in Table 1
show that in almost all of the models with a free or mixed
surface boundary, Tsub stays the same or increases slightly as
Figure 5. (a) Magnitude of the total subadiabatic tem-
perature drop and (b) area of domain with a positive
temperature gradient as a function of the Urey Ratio for
Ra = 105 and 106 in a 4 1 box and Ra = 107 in a 1 1 box.

M28 with H = 10 and viscosity jumps of mj = 1, 10, and 100

number.

the aspect ratio of the box is increased. When complete or
partial free-slip surface boundary conditions are used, wider
boxes result in longer wavelength convection cells and
enhanced horizontal advection of heat near the lower
boundary. Consequently, B2 becomes more important caus-
ing a greater bottom overshoot and hence increased sub-
adiabaticity.
[28] If the surface is no slip or is completely covered by
continental lithosphere, the wavelength of the convection
cells decreases when the aspect ratio of the box is increased.
With this boundary condition, more downwellings occur
and they are caused by closely spaced surface thermal
boundary layer instabilities. Because of the shorter wave-
length, B2 is less significant and hence the total subadiaba-
ticity is decreased. The results from 4  1 and 8  1 boxes
were essentially identical, indicating that an aspect ratio of 4
is sufficient to analyze the energy balances causing the
subadiabaticity.
9. Effects of Subadiabatic Temperature Gradients
on Heat Flow at the CMB
[29] In Figure 8 we present the time-averaged geotherms
for calculations carried out with the Rayleigh numbers
indicated on Figure 8 and with an internal heating rate of
H = 10 (M13, M22, M50 and M57). As has been pointed
out by Sotin and Labrosse [1999] and Butler and Peltier
[2000] in calculations with mixed basal and internal heating,
the mean internal temperature is a decreasing function of the
thermal Rayleigh number for a fixed internal heating rate.
Sotin and Labrosse [1999] presented scaling results for the
average temperature and for the surface heat flow based on
their three-dimensional numerical results, and our two-
dimensional results are in excellent agreement with their
scaling. Of interest is that as the thermal Rayleigh number
increases, the surface boundary layer thickness, ds,
decreases as roughly Ra1/3 while the internal temperature,
and hence the temperature drop across the surface thermal
boundary layer, DTs, decreases. The surface heat flow can
be calculated from Q = DTs/ds. As a result, the effects offset
one another, but the boundary layer thickness decreases
more rapidly leading to an increase in the surface heat flow
with increasing thermal Rayleigh number, but the increase
is much slower than in the purely basally heated case. At the
base of the convecting system, however, the decrease in the
average internal temperature increases the temperature drop,
DTc, and the basal boundary layer thickness, dc decreases as
roughly Ra1/3 so that both effects should lead to an
increase in the basal heat flow. In an equilibrium state,
however, the heat flow at the base is linked to the heat flow
at the surface by Qc = Qs  H where Qc and Qs represent the
total heat flows at the CMB and surface, respectively. The
effect of the subadiabatic gradient is to increase the tem-
perature drop at the CMB and it decreases with increasing
thermal Rayleigh number for fixed H as can be seen from
the results in Table 1. As we will show, the decrease in the
subadiabaticity allows for the energy balance at the CMB.
[30] That the subadiabatic gradient is important can be
easily verified by considering the run with Ra = 105 and H =
10 (M13) for which there would be practically no temper-
ature drop at the CMB in the absence of a subadiabatic
gradient while in this case the CMB heat flow accounts for
roughly 23% of the surface heat flow. The scaling results for
the surface heat flow of Sotin and Labrosse [1999] used the
average internal temperature, hTi, in order to calculate the
temperature drop at the surface and this was related to the heat
flow at the surface by a relationship roughly of the form Qs =
(Ra/Racrit)
1/3hTi4/3, as would be expected from boundary
layer theory where Racrit is the critical boundary layer
Rayleigh number [e.g., Butler and Peltier, 2000]. In Figure 9
we present the surface heat flow Qsmeas = (@T/@z)jz=1,
calculated from numerical models run with Ra  106, H > 0,
constant viscosity and free-slip boundaries, plotted versus
Qspred = (Ra/Racrit)
1/3T4/3 for T = Tmax (‘+’ signs) and T =
hTi, (squares). For both T = Tmax and T = hTi we have
chosen Racrit in order to give the smallest least squares
misfit between the predicted and measured value of Qs. The
values obtained for Racrit in this way were 23.8 and 28.2,
respectively. We have plotted a straight line with a slope of

1 so that the quality of the fit can be easily discerned. It can
be seen from the graph that the fit is not qualitatively
improved by using Tmax rather than hTi and quantitatively
the average misfit between Qsmeas and Qspred is 2.0 for both
calculations, again indicating that the difference between
hTi and Tmax is not important when parameterizing the heat
flow at the surface.
[31] In Figure 10 we present a similar calculation for the
basal heat flow, where Qcmeas and Qcpred are the basal heat
flows calculated by the numerical model and from a
parameterized model using temperature from the numerical
model. In this case we have calculated the temperature drop
at the base using 1  T where T is calculated using hTi
(squares) and Tmin, (‘+’s). It can be seen that the fit is now
qualitatively improved by using Tmin, which is the minimum
horizontally averaged internal temperature. The average
misfits between Qcmeas and Qcpred are 1.1 and 2.1 when
Tmin and hTi are used to calculate the temperature drop at
the basal thermal boundary layer, respectively. This indi-
cates that using Tmin is important in parameterizing the basal
heat flow and that the effects of the subadiabatic gradient
are important and act to increase the heat flow at the base of
a convecting system with mixed basal and internal heating.
[32] Although the degree of subadiabaticity clearly
increases with H and decreases with Ra, as shown in
Figure 5, no simple scaling relationship for the subadiabatic
gradient could be found based on the results of our study. As
a result, the best way to calculate thermal evolution in
parameterized models, taking the mantle subadiabatic gra-
dient into account, might be to calculate the surface heat
flow, internal temperature and secular cooling first and then
calculate the CMB heat flow based on the energy balance as
proposed by Sotin and Labrosse [1999].
10. Conclusion
[33] We have presented a detailed study of the energy
balance in regions of subadiabatic gradient for calculations
with mixed basal and internal heating. Until now the
subadiabatic gradient in an internally heated calculation
was thought to be caused by the balance between vertical
advection and internal heating. However, our study shows
that there are three different mechanisms responsible for the
subadiabaticity. We find that B2 (balance between horizontal
and vertical advection) is significant for calculations with
lower degrees of internal heating, whereas B1 (balance
between vertical advection and internal heating) becomes
increasingly important with increasing internal heating. B3
(balance between local secular cooling and the other terms
in the energy equation) can play the role of either B1 or B2 in
a temporally averaged geotherm. When the model is not
time-dependent, B1 is mostly responsible for the subadia-
baticity within the bulk of the mantle, whereas B2 mostly
produces the bottom geotherm overshoot. Our results sug-
gest that the bottom overshoot makes the largest contribu-
tion to the subadiabaticity for values of H smaller than
roughly Qs0, where Qs0 is the surface heat flow in the
absence of internal heating. The total subadiabaticity and the
area with a subadiabatic gradient increase with increasing
Urey ratio.
[34] Our models with depth-dependent viscosity and
mixed heating indicate that the surface overshoot reappears
as we increase the total jump in viscosity. The surface
overshoot may be responsible for the presence of the seismic
low-velocity zone (LVZ) [Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981].
It is interesting that a low-viscosity channel, such as the
asthenosphere, may cause a larger thermal overshoot near
the surface which may in turn reinforce the low-viscosity
channel if viscosity is temperature dependent.
[35] In the case of mixed surface boundary conditions, the
shape of the geotherm does not depend on the position of
the continent; however, the presence of a rigid conducting
lid increases the subadiabatic gradient in the bulk, implying
that Mars and Venus may have significantly subadiabatic
interiors.
[36] If we consider an Earth-like surface heat flow, then
calculations M41 to M45 are most comparable to our planet,
and have Urey ratios of 72% to 87%. This suggests that the
mantle subadiabaticity may be as large as 450 K and 55% to
60% of the volume of the mantle may have a subadiabatic

temperature gradient. Here we are taking the effective
internal heating rate for the Earth to be the sum of the
secular cooling and actual internal heating. In these calcu-
lations all three balance mechanisms are active.
[37] We have shown that the effects of subadiabaticity are
important for parameterizing the CMB heat flow. As an
example, if we consider M38, as Earth-like, this suggests a
mantle subadiabaticity of Tsub = 407 K. This would change
the total CMB heat flow by 3.8 TW, if we assume a core-
mantle boundary layer thickness equal to average thickness
of D’’ layer, which is 260 km [Kendall and Shearer, 1994]
and a thermal conductivity of 16 W/mK [Brown, 1986].
[38] We have identified and quantified the various effects
by which subadiabaticity is produced in simple models of
internally heated infinite Prandtl number convection. In
future work, it will be interesting to explore the effects of
compressibility, temperature-dependent viscosity, sphericity,
better representations of surface plates and the effects of
mantle phase transitions and how these affect the mecha-
nisms, that we have identified here, responsible for the
subadiabatic gradients.
