ABSTRACT
In fulfilling its biosynthetic roles in nuclear replica-
tion and in several types of repair, DNA polymerase
d (pol d) is assisted by replication protein A (RPA),
the single-stranded DNA-binding protein complex,
and by the processivity clamp proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA). Here we report the effects
of these accessory proteins on the fidelity of DNA
synthesis in vitro by yeast pol d. We show that when
RPA and PCNA are included in reactions containing
pol d, rates for single base errors are similar to
those generated by pol d alone, indicating that pol d
itself is by far the prime determinant of fidelity for
single base errors. However, the rate of deleting
multiple nucleotides between directly repeated
sequences is reduced by 10-fold in the presence
of either RPA or PCNA, and by 90-fold when both
proteins are present. We suggest that PCNA and
RPA suppress large deletion errors by preventing
the primer terminus at a repeat from fraying and/or
from relocating and annealing to a downstream
repeat. Strong suppression of deletions by PCNA
and RPA suggests that they may contribute to the
high replication fidelity needed to stably maintain
eukaryotic genomes that contain abundant repetit-
ive sequences.
INTRODUCTION
DNA polymerase d (pol d) has a major and essential role in
eukaryotic nuclear DNA replication (1). Pol d also performs
DNA synthesis during homologous recombination and fills
DNA gaps during mismatch repair, long patch base excision
repair of damaged bases and nucleotide excision repair of
bulky DNA lesions [reviewed in (2)]. Because all these trans-
actions influence eukaryotic genome stability, it is of interest
to understand the fidelity of DNA synthesis conducted by
pol d. Previous studies (3–5) have shown that pol d is a
highly accurate enzyme whose fidelity derives from high
nucleotide selectivity at the polymerase active site and from
proofreading by its intrinsic 30 exonuclease activity.
In performing its roles in replication and repair, pol d is
assisted by accessory proteins. The three-subunit replication
protein A (RPA) complex (6) binds single-stranded DNA
and coordinates the exchange of pol d and other proteins at
template–primer termini (7). In addition, the processivity of
pol d is enhanced by proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) (8), the sliding clamp that is loaded onto template–
primers by the five-subunit RFC complex (9). There are
several reasons to consider whether RPA or PCNA modulate
the fidelity of DNA synthesis by pol d. Genetic studies have
identified mutations in the genes encoding the large subunit
of RPA (10,11), RFC subunits (12,13) and PCNA (14,15)
that elevate mutation rates. Among several possible explana-
tions for these mutator effects, one is that they may result
from reduced DNA synthesis fidelity by pol d during
replication (15), repair or recombination. Single-stranded
DNA-binding proteins have been shown previously to affect
the fidelity of other DNA polymerases [e.g. see (16,17) and
references therein]. Proteins that enhance polymerase pro-
cessivity promote the extension of mismatches (18–20),
which could reduce base substitution fidelity by preventing
partitioning of mismatches to the active sites of proofreading
exonucleases (21). On the other hand, several studies
[reviewed in (22)] have shown that the processivity of DNA
polymerases correlates with their insertion/deletion (indel)
fidelity in mononucleotide repeat sequences, such that pro-
teins that increase processivity may improve indel fidelity.
Here we test these ideas by examining the fidelity of DNA
synthesis by three-subunit yeast DNA polymerase d alone
and its fidelity in the presence of RPA alone, PCNA (plus
its loader RFC) and all three accessory protein complexes.
To evaluate the effects of these accessory proteins on both
nucleotide selectivity and proofreading, we compare error
rates of proofreading-proficient (wild-type) pol d to those
observed with two different proofreading-deficient deri-
vatives. To obtain a comprehensive view of the effects of

accessory proteins on pol d fidelity, we use an assay (23) that
scores a variety of base substitution and indel errors. The res-
ults indicate that fidelity for errors involving single base
pairs is largely determined by pol d itself. However, the
accessory proteins strongly modulate the ability of pol d to
delete large numbers of nucleotides between directly repeated
sequences. The results are discussed in relation to earlier
studies (cited below) on the effects of accessory proteins,
and in light of models for how accessory proteins may
modulate fidelity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Yeast RPA, PCNA and RFC were purified from Escherichia
coli overproducing strains as described elsewhere (24,25).
All materials for the fidelity assay were from previously
described sources (23,26).
Overexpression and purification of Pol d
Plasmid pBL335 (bluescript, 2 mM ori, TRP1, M13 ori,
GAL1-10 GST-POL3) contains the Schistosoma japanicum
glutathione S-transferase gene (GST) fused to the N-terminus
of the POL3 gene in vector pRS424-GALGSTPKA. The GST
tag is separated from the POL3 gene by a recognition
sequence for the human rhinoviral protease (LEVLFQ/GP),
followed by a recognition site for the catalytic subunit of
cAMP dependent protein kinase (27). After cleavage by the
protease the N-terminal sequence of the Pol3 polypeptide is
altered from MSEKRSLPM to GPEFRRASVGSM. Plasmid
pBL341 (bluescript, 2 mM ori, URA3, M13 ori, GAL1-10,
POL31, POL32) has the POL31 and POL32 genes placed
divergently under control of the bidirectional GAL1-10 pro-
moter into vector pRS426-GAL. Plasmids and sequences
are available upon request from P.M.B. Plasmid pBL335-
DV (as pBL335, but pol3-5DV¼pol3D520V) was made
by gap repair. pBL335 was cut with BglII and NdeI,
releasing that portion of the POL3 gene containing the
intended mutation, and the isolated large fragment was
transformed into strain YH712 (MATa ade5-1 his7-2
leu2-3,112::lys2D5’-LEU2 lys2::InsHS-D trp1-289 ura3-52
pep4::KanMX pol3-5DV) (28). After plasmid recovery, the
mutation was confirmed by sequencing.
Overexpression was in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain
BJ2168 (MATa, ura3-52, trp1-289, leu2-3, 112, prb1-1122,
prc1-407, pep4-3) transformed with pBL341 and with either
pBL335 or pBL335-DV. Growth and induction was as
described elsewhere, and so was the preparation of cell lys-
ates by blending with dry ice (29). Cells (60 g of packed
cells resuspended in 20 ml of water) frozen previously in
liquid nitrogen in the form of popcorn were blended with
40 ml of buffer 3A (buffer A, 30 mM HEPES–NaOH,
pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.02%
Nonidet P-40, 2 mM DTT, 10 mM sodium bisulfite, 10 mM
pepstatin A and 10 mM leupeptin). All further operations
were carried out at 0–4C. After thawing of the lysate,
1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (from a 100 mM
stock in isopropanol) and 150 mM ammonium sulfate (from
a 4 M stock) were stirred in, followed by 0.45% polymin P
(from a 10% stock at pH 7.3). After stirring for 15 min, the
lysate was cleared at 40 000 g for 40 min, and the supernatant
precipitated with 0.28 g/ml of solid ammonium sulfate.
The precipitate was collected at 40 000 g for 45 min, and
redissolved in 75–125 ml of buffer A until the conductivity
equals that of A250 (subscript denotes NaCl concentration).
Batch binding to 2 ml of glutathione–Sepharose 4B beads
(GE Healthcare), equilibrated previously in buffer A250, was
accomplished by gentle rotation in the cold room for 2 h.
The beads were collected at 1000 r.p.m. in a swinging bucket
rotor, batch washed, by resuspension and spinning, with
3· 30 ml of buffer A250, transferred to a 10 ml column,
and washed at 2 ml/min with 100 ml of A250. Bound chaper-
ones, particularly Ssa1, were removed by a 30 ml wash
with A250 containing 1 mM ATP and 5 mM Mg-acetate.
After another 10 ml wash with A150 to remove residual
nucleotide and decrease salt, the beads were resuspended in
2 ml A150 containing 20 mM glutathione (pH adjusted to
8.0). The capped column was incubated on ice for 10 min,
and the eluant collected. This procedure was repeated four
times. Most of the protein eluted in fractions 1–4. These
fractions (0.5–1 mg protein) were incubated overnight at
4C with 30 U of PreScission protease (GE Healthcare),
and then directly loaded onto a 1 ml MonoS column as
described elsewhere (30). Concentrated pure enzyme eluted
at 350–400 mM NaCl.
Gap-filling DNA synthesis reactions and
product analysis
Reactions (25 ml) contained 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.7), 8 mM
MgAc2, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM ATP, 100 mM of each dNTP,
1 mM DTT, 100 mg/ml BSA and 40 fmol (1.6 nM) gapped
M13mp2 DNA. When included, the amounts of the accessory
proteins used were 500 fmol PCNA, 200 fmol RFC and
10 pmol RPA, an amount more than sufficient to coat the
single-stranded DNA within the gap. Polymerization
reactions were performed at 30C. The amount of pol d and
reaction times were: pol d alone, 2.0 pmol for naked DNA or
1.5 pmol with RPA-coated DNA, both 30 min; pol d plus
accessory proteins, 150 fmol pol d for 5 min for naked
DNA and for 2 min with RPA-coated DNA. These quantities
of pol d and incubation times were chosen such that, when
DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis
as described elsewhere (23), all reactions filled the 407 nt gap
without obvious strand displacement [data not shown, but
for typical result see Figure 3 in Ref. (23)]. Note that syn-
thesis by pol d alone is only moderately processive, such
that complete gap filling likely involves multiple cycles of
binding and dissociation. Importantly, reactions containing
150 fmol of pol d alone failed to fill the gap, indicating
that synthesis catalyzed by pol d was indeed stimulated by
the presence of the accessory proteins.
DNA products of gap-filling reactions were introduced
into E.coli cells and plated as described elsewhere (23) to
score blue M13 plaques (correct synthesis) and light blue
and colorless plaques (containing errors). The types of errors
were determined by sequencing the lacZ a-complementation
gene in single-stranded DNA isolated from independent
mutant M13 plaques, allowing calculation of error rates
as described previously (5). The statistical significance of

differences in error rates with and without accessory
proteins was calculated using the Fisher’s exact test (31).
Because several such comparisons were made, the multiple
comparisons method of Benjamini and Hochberg (32) was
used to control the false discovery rate to no more than 0.05.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fidelity measurements and calculation of error rates
Pol d fidelity with and without accessory proteins was
determined for synthesis to fill a single-stranded gap in a
circular duplex M13mp2 DNA substrate. This gap contains
the lacZ a-complementation template sequence (Figure 1)
that when copied correctly results in a blue M13 plaque
phenotype. Polymerization errors are detected as light blue
and colorless plaques. A total of 12 gap-filling reactions
were conducted and the products analyzed for lacZ mutant
frequencies. Four reactions contained wild-type pol d
(Table 1, Experiment 1), either alone, with RPA, with
PCNA and RFC or with all three accessory protein com-
plexes. The lacZ mutant frequencies for all reactions with
wild-type pol d were several-fold lower than for parallel
reactions performed with exonuclease-deficient pol3-5DV
pol d (Experiment 2) or exonuclease-deficient pol3-01 pol d
(Experiment 3), reflecting the contribution of proofreading
to the overall fidelity of the wild-type enzyme (see more
below). DNA samples were prepared from independent
lacZ mutants collected from each of the 12 reactions, and
were sequenced to identify the types (Table 1) and locations
(Figure 1) of sequence changes responsible for reduced
plaque colors. As observed previously for three-subunit
yeast pol d alone (5), four main classes of sequence changes
were observed: single base substitutions, single nucleotide
deletions, single nucleotide insertions and deletions of larger
numbers of nucleotides between direct repeat sequences
(Table 1). The mutant frequency and sequence specificity
information (Table1) was then used to calculate average
rates (errors per detectable nucleotide polymerized) for
single base errors (Table 2) and mutant frequencies for
large deletions (Table 3).
In order to separate the effects of the accessory factors
on polymerase insertion fidelity from those on proofreading
efficiency, we will first discuss our results with the
exonuclease-deficient pol d, followed by those with the
wild-type enzyme. Because similar results were obtained
for each of the two exonuclease-deficient polymerases,
those data were combined.
Effects on selectivity against base–base mismatches
The most common errors generated by pol d were single base
substitutions. The calculated average single base substitution
error rate of exonuclease-deficient pol d alone is 6.3 · 105
(Table 2), confirming an earlier report that yeast pol d has
high base substitution fidelity (5). Interestingly, similar base
substitution error rates were obtained for pol d reactions
that contained RPA, PCNA plus RFC or all three accessory
proteins. Detecting errors in this type of fidelity assay
requires both nucleotide misinsertion and extension of the
resulting mismatch. Thus, the similarities in average base
substitution error rates suggest that the accessory proteins
do not strongly influence the nucleotide selectivity of the
pol d active site or strongly alter discrimination for extension
of matched versus mismatched primer termini.
The base substitution values in Table 2 are average error
rates for numerous different mismatches in a variety of
sequence contexts. From these average rates, it cannot be
excluded that the accessory proteins have modest effects
on nucleotide selectivity and/or mismatch extension for
specific mismatches and/or in specific sequence contexts.
For example, a previous kinetic study demonstrated that
PCNA decreases the selectivity of exonuclease-deficient
yeast pol d for misinsertions opposite a specific template
guanine by 2- to 4-fold (4). Any such effects here would
be small compared to the >10 000-fold contribution to
selectivity conferred by exonuclease-deficient pol d alone.
This conclusion is reinforced by studies of several other
replicative polymerases (17–20,33–38) indicating that
accessory proteins have only small effects that sometimes
enhance and sometimes reduce discrimination against base
substitution errors. Thus we conclude that pol d itself is by
far the primary determinant of selectivity against base sub-
stitution errors resulting from copying an undamaged DNA
template.
Effects on proofreading of base–base mismatches
An estimate of the contribution of proofreading to base sub-
stitution fidelity in the absence and presence of the accessory
proteins can be obtained by comparing error rates for
exonuclease-deficient pol d to those for wild-type pol d
(Table 2). We believe that these are minimal estimates
because the base substitutions recovered from reactions by
wild-type pol d are thought to largely reflect background
noise in the assay due to very low levels of spontaneous sub-
stitutions and cryptic damage (e.g. cytosine deamination) in
the gapped DNA substrate. With this caveat in mind, the
ratios of base substitution error rates are similar for all four
reactions. This is interesting in light of studies indicating
that proteins that increase processivity promote extension of
base–base mismatches by T7 DNA polymerase (18), T4
DNA polymerase (19) and human DNA polymerase g (20).
The present results suggest that the accessory proteins neither
strongly enhance nor strongly suppress proofreading by
pol d when copying an undamaged DNA template, as expec-
ted in order to maintain both high processivity and high
fidelity during yeast chromosomal DNA replication.
Effects on single nucleotide deletion and addition errors
The second most common single base error made by pol d is
deletion of 1 nt (Table 2). The rates at which these errors are
generated by pol d in the absence or presence of RFC/PCNA
and/or RPA either do not differ in a statistically significant
manner, or they differ in a statistically significant manner
but by <2-fold. Such effects are small relative to the
100 000-fold discrimination imposed by the polymerase
alone, indicating that PCNA, RFC and RPA contribute very
little to preventing single base deletion errors by pol d.
However, in all four reactions, single base deletion error
rates are higher for exonuclease-deficient pol d than for

wild-type pol d, suggesting that misaligned intermediates
are proofread with or without the accessory proteins present.
Exonuclease-deficient pol d also generates single base
additions at a readily detectable overall average rate of
0.66 · 105 (Table 2). This rate is not appreciably influenced
by RPA (0.80 · 105), but is reduced 7-fold by PCNA plus
RFC (P-value for difference ¼ 0.0007). Wild-type pol d
alone (error rate >0.026 · 105) is at least 25-fold more
accurate for one base additions than exonuclease-deficient
pol d. This difference is larger than observed for single
base deletions, supporting our earlier interpretation (5) that
pol d proofreads addition intermediates more efficiently
than deletion intermediates. Just as for deletions, single
base addition error rates in all four reactions are higher
for exonuclease-deficient pol d than for wild-type pol d,
suggesting that addition intermediates are proofread with
or without accessory proteins present.
Effects on deletions between direct repeats
The effects of accessory proteins on single base error rates are
modest in comparison with the dominant role of the poly-
merase itself in discriminating against single base errors.
However, the situation is different for deletions of larger
numbers of nucleotides located between direct repeat
sequences. We found previously that pol d alone is particu-
larly prone to generating these types of deletions (5), and
does so at frequencies that are similar for the wild-type and
exonuclease-deficient enzymes, indicating that the misaligned
intermediates are not efficiently proofread. The present
study confirms those observations (Table 3, line 1). More
importantly, the results show that the ability of pol d to
generate large deletions between direct repeats is strongly
suppressed by RPA alone (line 2) or by PCNA plus RFC
(line 3). Moreover, no deletions between direct repeats
were generated by wild-type pol d in the presence of all
three accessory proteins, representing a >90-fold increase
in fidelity for this class of errors.

Larger deletions include loss of multiple nucleotides between direct repeats of two or more bases. Other changes include di- and tri-nucleotide deletions, additions of
multiple nucleotides, tandem base substitution/deletions, complex deletions and (rare, spontaneous) deletions (40). The total number of specific mutations reported
is sometimes different from the number of lacZ mutants due to the presence of two errors in single mutant (increasing the number of errors reported) and/or the
occasional inability to obtain sequence data from a mutant (decreasing the number of errors reported).

How RPA and PCNA may suppress formation of large
deletions by pol d can be considered in light of a model
for deletions between direct repeats [Figure 2 (39)]. In this
model, after the first repeat sequence encountered by the
polymerase is copied, the primer frays and then relocates to
the second repeat sequence. Hybridization would provide a
duplex primer–template for continued polymerization, but
in a misaligned intermediate that contains a loop of unpaired,
template strand bases that are eventually deleted. In certain
sequence environments, when an inverted repeat (designated
1r in Figure 2) is present at the deletion junction, the mis-
aligned intermediate may be stabilized through formation of
a stem at the base of the single-stranded loop (Figure 2, lower
right). Within the context of this model, PCNA may suppress
deletion formation by preventing fraying of the primer ter-
minus at the first repeat, and/or by preventing relocation of
the primer to the downstream repeat. RPA may suppress dele-
tion formation by coating the single-stranded DNA to reduce
the probability of DNA rearrangement and/or prevent the
frayed primer terminus from annealing to the downstream
repeat. The observation that all three accessory proteins
together yield lower large deletion frequencies than either
RPA alone or PCNA plus RFC (Table 3) is consistent with
the idea that RPA and PCNA affect large deletion fidelity
at least partly by different mechanisms. This possibility is
further supported by the observation that RPA suppresses
deletions generated by exonuclease-deficient pol d that can
be modeled by both pathways depicted in Figure 2 to about
the same extent (10-fold, Table 3). However, while
PCNA also strongly suppresses deletions between repeats
that are potentially stabilized by a stem containing two or
more correct base pairs (Table 3, compare 250 · 105 to
16 · 105, Figure 2, right), it has little effect on deletions
that lack an obvious inverted repeat (Figure 2, left). By virtue
of their ability to prevent wild-type pol d from generating
these types of replication errors, PCNA and RPA may have
important roles in protecting eukaryotic genomes against
the biological consequences of large deletions, and perhaps
also in modulating the stability of large tracts of repetitive
sequences whose instabilities are associated with hereditary
degenerative diseases.

These large deletions involve loss of multiple nucleotides between direct repeats of two or more bases. Those listed as involving an inverted repeat could
theoretically be stabilized by a ‘stem’ of at least two correct base pairs, in rare cases allowing for one mismatch, e.g. a T–G mismatch.
aWhile error rates for single base events in Table 2 are expressed as ‘errors per nucleotide incorporated’, the values for deletion of multiple bases are expressed here
simply as mutant frequencies (· 105).
