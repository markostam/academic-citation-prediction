ABSTRACT
Every year between 500 and 1000 peptide and protein
structures are determined byNMR and deposited into
the Protein Data Bank. However, the process of NMR
structure determination continues to be a manually
intensive and time-consuming task. One of the most
tedious and error-prone aspects of this process
involves the determination of torsion angle restraints
including phi, psi, omega and chi angles. Most meth-
ods require many days of additional experiments,
painstaking measurements or complex calcula-
tions. Here we wish to describe a web server, called
PREDITOR, which greatly accelerates and simplifies
this task. PREDITOR accepts sequence and/or
chemical shift data as input and generates torsion
angle predictions (with predicted errors) for phi,
psi, omega and chi-1 angles. PREDITOR combines
sequence alignment methods with advanced chem-
ical shift analysis techniques to generate its torsion
angle predictions. The method is fast (,40 s per pro-
tein) and accurate, with 88% of phi/psi predictions
being within 30 of the correct values, 84% of chi-1
predictionsbeingcorrectand99.97%ofomegaangles
being correct. PREDITOR is 35 times faster and up
to 20% more accurate than any existing method.
PREDITOR also provides accurate assessments of
the torsion angle errors so that the torsion angle
constraints can be readily fed into standard structure
refinement programs, such as CNS, XPLOR, AMBER
and CYANA. Other unique features to PREDITOR
include dihedral angle prediction via PDB structure
mapping, automated chemical shift re-referencing
(to improve accuracy), prediction of proline cis/
trans states and a simple user interface. The

INTRODUCTION
The generation of torsion angle restraints is among the most
critical steps in protein structure determination by NMR. In
many cases, torsion angles play a key role in defining or
‘tightening’ the secondary structure of protein structures dur-
ing the structure refinement process. Torsion angles also are
used in lieu of other restraints (i.e. NOEs) when these data are
missing. The importance of torsion angle information tends to
increase with the size of the protein being studied as the qual-
ity and quantity of other restraints, such as NOEs, deteriorate
due to increased spectral overlap and reduced sensitivity.
Because of their importance in structure calculations, all
commonly used software packages for NMR structure
determination, such as CNS (1), XPLOR (2), CYANA (3)
and AMBER (4), accept torsion angles as restraints.
In NMR, the information about torsion angles is commonly
obtained from scalar couplings (e.g. 3JHNHa,
3JHa-1N,
3JC0Ha)
and cross-correlated relaxation experiments (5–10), and often
involves comparing peak intensities or measuring peak split-
ting. The accuracy of these measurements can be severely
compromised by signal broadening and low signal-to-noise
ratios, especially when dealing with larger (>150 residue)
proteins. Chemical shifts offer an alternative route for obtain-
ing torsion angle restraints. Indeed, it is well known that 1Ha,
13Ca and 13CO shifts are very sensitive to backbone f/y
angles, while 15N shifts appear to be significantly influenced
by side chain c1 angles of the preceding residue (11). Chem-
ical shift measurements are less affected by peak overlap
or reduced spectral sensitivity than measurements of peak
intensities and peak splittings. Furthermore, chemical shift
measurements are routinely obtained for all peptides and pro-
teins and often do not require additional NMR experiments
beyond those needed for backbone assignments. Indeed,
chemical shift measurements are commonly done as the first
step in the NMR-assisted determination of protein structures.
The simplicity and accuracy of chemical shift measure-
ments in combination with the public availability of thou-
sands of protein chemical shift assignments has prompted
the development of a number of protocols that use chemical

shifts to predict backbone dihedral angles (12–17). TALOS
(17) is one such example and is currently one of the most
commonly used programs that utilize chemical shifts to
obtain dihedral angles. TALOS predicts f and y torsion
angles by comparing the chemical shifts and primary
sequence of the protein being studied with a database of
homologous polypeptides with known torsion angles and
chemical shifts. TALOS has made a profound impact on pro-
tein NMR, having appeared in more than 700 published
works to date. However, TALOS has certain limitations.
For instance, it does not predict side chain (c1) or cis-trans
peptide bond angles (w) nor can it handle mis-referenced
chemical shifts. Furthermore, TALOS does not provide
information about bounds of torsion angle restraints that are
required for NMR structure calculations. It also runs very
slowly (22 min for a 150 residue protein on a 2.6 GHz
processor).
The motivation for the current work was our belief that
the prediction of torsion angles could be extended to angles
other than f and y, that these predictions could be performed
much faster, and that their accuracy could be significantly
improved if the recent advances in our understanding of
chemical shifts and the growing body of protein structural
information could be implemented in a prediction protocol.
Here we describe a program, called PREDITOR (PREDIction
of TORsion angles from chemical shift and homology), that
is able to accurately predict a large number of protein torsion
angles (f, y, w, c) using either 1H, 13C and 15N chemical
shift assignments or protein sequence (alone) as input. Over-
all, the program is 35· faster and the accuracy (for combined
shift-based and homology-based prediction of f/y angles,
using a 30o tolerance) is 20% greater than TALOS. The
program can also predict g+, g, trans states of c1 angles
with 84% accuracy and w angles are predicted with essen-
tially 100% accuracy (using a 2-state, cis/trans state pre-
diction). PREDITOR is able to extend the limits of torsion
angle prediction accuracy by (i) combining shift based and
homology based predictions, (ii) taking advantage of better
understanding the relationship between chemical shifts and
torsion angles and (iii) utilizing recent advances in correcting
mis-referenced NMR assignments and predicting of protein
flexibility from chemical shifts. The PREDITOR website is

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
PREDITOR is composed of two parts, a front-end web inter-
face (Figure 1) written in Python and HTML and a back-end
‘calculator’ that consists of several programs including RCI
(18), CSI (19), VADAR (20), BLAST (21) and REFCOR
[based on (22)] as well as several parsing and conversion util-
ities for reading input files. Four of the programs—BLAST,
VADAR, CSI and the core of the PREDITOR code are written
in ANSI standard C. Several other programs including RCI,
REFCOR and most input parsing and conversion utilities
are written in Python. PREDITOR also accesses two data-
bases, a local database of NMR assignments and torsion
angles and the Protein Data Bank (23). The source code for
the basic algorithm is available from the authors upon
request.
PREDITOR accepts three kinds of input files: (i) chemical
shift assignments in BMRB NMR-STAR format (24),
(ii) chemical shift assignments in SHIFTY format (25) and
(iii) raw protein sequence in FASTA format (26). Users can
either upload an input file into the web server (via a browse
button) or paste the data in a standard text box. Users are also
offered several options to adjust program operations to suit
their specific needs. By default, PREDITOR uses both chem-
ical shifts (via RefDB) and sequence homology (to structural
homologues in the PDB) to predict torsion angles. This usu-
ally guarantees maximal performance with minimal user
input (27). However, the reliance on homology-based predic-
tions may not be desirable in some cases. For example, a user
may wish to assess the agreement between the shift-based
(NMR) torsion angles and the torsion angles measured for
an existing X-ray structure of the same protein. In such
cases, PREDITOR allows users to select the radio-button
option to predict dihedral angles from chemical shifts only.
In other cases, a user may only want to use homology-
based predictions in his or her research. For instance, a com-
parison of torsion angles predicted from chemical shifts with
those predicted via homology may aid in resolving ambigu-
ous cases during the NMR assignment process. In these
cases, users may select the radio-button option to predict
dihedral angles via homology only. PREDITOR also offer
users the flexibility to specify the PDB ID of the protein
structure that should be used in homology-based predictions.
This feature is especially useful when the structure of the
best-matching homologue was solved, say, under signific-
antly different experimental conditions (e.g. high urea con-
centration to partially unfold the protein) or if the structure
corresponds to a protein in a different functional form (e.g.
ligand-bound, post-translationally modified, etc.). To help
users identify an appropriate homologue, we offer an option
to BLAST their protein against the PDB and to display the
results so they are hyperlinked to the corresponding pages
of the PDB. These options are available only when chemical
shifts are submitted to the web server. If a FASTA sequence
only is used as input, torsion angles are predicted from a PDB
homologue with the best BLAST E-value.
One of the more important advantages of PREDITOR over
existing programs is its capability to correct mis-referenced
chemical shifts (17,27). Chemical shift referencing, particu-
larly for 13C and 15N shifts, continues to be a major problem
in biomolecular NMR with about 20% of newly deposited
assignments in the BMRB database being mis-referenced
(28). Mis-referenced shifts could substantially reduce the per-
formance of chemical shift-based torsion angle predictions.
PREDITOR’s reference correction option is always turned
on by default and can be switched off if necessary.
An average PREDITOR run takes about 38 CPU seconds
on a 2.6 GHz processor equipped with 512 Mbytes of
RAM. An example of the program output is shown in
Figure 1. As might be expected, PREDITOR displays the
name of the input file, the options selected, the PDB ID,
the BLAST E-value and the level of identity of the PDB
homologue (if any) used in predictions. Below these data,
the predicted torsion angles (f, y, w and c1), their errors
and confidence scores are shown in a tabular format. These
values are also available for download. Torsion angles
predicted from a homology model are labeled with asterisk.

In addition to these data, the output page contains hyperlinks
to additional web pages with the results of the sequence
alignment (‘BLAST results’), chemical shift reference cor-
rections (‘REFCOR results’), the predictions of protein flex-
ibility (‘RCI results’) and secondary structure predictions
(‘CSI results’) derived from chemical shifts. The PREDITOR
server also allows users to download the predicted/calculated
dihedral angles restraints in CNS, CYANA, AMBER and
XPLOR format. In addition to its rich and extensive data out-
put, PREDITOR also offers a comprehensive list of help
pages to assist users in preparing their input files, in under-
standing torsion angle prediction methods and in understand-
ing the program output. This information is provided to make
the PREDITOR protocol as transparent as possible and to
facilitate any troubleshooting if necessary.
The basic PREDITOR prediction algorithm has been
described in much more detail elsewhere (27). What follows
is a brief overview of the program’s general principles.
PREDITOR predicts protein torsion angles using a combined
protocol that can be roughly divided into two components:
shift-based predictions and homology-based predictions. If a
set of NMR assignments is submitted to the program, both

Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Web Server issue W65
types of predictions are run and their results are merged
based on their respective errors or confidence levels, and on
‘switch points’ as explained below. If a FASTA sequence is
supplied as an input file, only homology-based predictions are
performed.
Chemical shift-based predictions are initiated by re-
referencing the NMR assignments (if this option is not turned
off by the user). Shift re-referencing is done by an in-house
program called REFCOR. REFCOR applies a recently pub-
lished protocol that uses Ha chemical shifts for the initial
identification of secondary structure and the calculation of
reference offsets (22). REFCOR can also go beyond the ori-
ginal procedure and properly predict secondary structure and
correct referencing using other nuclei (Ca, CO and Cb) or a
consensus Chemical Shift Index calculation (19). These
features enable PREDITOR/REFCOR to re-reference shifts
in the absence of Ha assignments. A more detailed descrip-
tion of REFCOR features and performance will be published
elsewhere.
For shift-based predictions, PREDITOR derives backbone
torsion angles by comparing the chemical shifts of successive
amino acid triplets from the query sequence with triplets
contained in PREDITOR’s own shift/structure database. Cur-
rently, the most recent version of this shift/structure database
consists of 141 different protein entries obtained from RefDB
(providing chemical shift data) and the PDB (providing tor-
sion angle data). The torsion angles for each residue were
generated using VADAR. The chemical shifts in the database
were re-referenced via SHIFTCOR (28). Updates to the data-
base and updates of PREDITOR’s performance relative to its
standard test sets will be posted on PREDITOR’s Help pages
at regular intervals.
To calculate the backbone torsion angles from chemical
shifts, PREDITOR calculates a sequence/shift similarity
score [S(i,j)]. For each query triplet ‘i’ and each database
triplet ‘j’ the similarity score S(i,j) is calculated using the
following equation.
Sði‚ jÞ ¼ Sf0:5 * Kn1ðSeqSimÞ
þ Kn2ðjdDCaiþn  DdCajþnjÞ
þ Kn3ðjdDCbiþn  DdCbjþnjÞ
þ Kn4ðjdDCOiþn  dDCOjþnjÞ
þ Kn5ðjdDHaiþn  dDHajþnjÞ
þ Kn6ðjdDNiþn  dDNjþnjÞ
þ Kn7ðjdDHNiþn  dDHNjþnjÞg 1
where S sums over the triplet of n ¼ 1 to 1, Knm corres-
ponds to empirically determined weighting coefficients
(Table 1 on the PREDITOR help page) for each triplet ‘n’
of each term ‘m’, SeqSim represents the sequence similarity
between each sequence triplet using the SeqSee weight mat-
rix (29). dDX is the secondary chemical shift (30) of nucleus
X. The similarity score [S(i,j)] between the query triplet and
database triplet is calculated for all triplets in the database.
The ten triplets with the lowest scores are selected and torsion
angles for central triplet residues are extracted. The predicted
torsion angles are clustered if the difference of the f or y
angles is less than 15. The mean f and y angles of the
cluster with the lowest overall S(i,j) score are used as the
predicted torsion angles for the central residue of the query
triplet.
PREDITOR uses probabilistic c1 hypersurfaces calculated
by Dunbrack (31) to generate an initial set of predicted c1
angles based on conformations of f or y angles. Each c1
angle is predicted to be in one of three states (60, +60
and 180) and assigned a confidence score between 0 and 1
(with 1 being most confident). By default, PREDITOR assigns
a trans conformation (180) to w angles of all non-proline
residues. The presence of cis peptide bonds in proline resi-
dues is detected via comparison of the 13Cb and 13Cg shifts
(32). If the absolute difference between the 13Cb and 13Cg
shifts is greater than 9 p.p.m. or if Trp, Tyr, Phe, Gly and
Cys are in either i  1 or i + 1 positions around proline (33)
and 13Cb, 13Cg shift difference is between 8 and 9 p.p.m.,
PREDITOR assigns a cis-w angle (0) to the proline residue.
PREDITOR’s homology-based predictions are initiated
from a pairwise sequence alignment of the input sequence
and all known PDB sequences using BLAST (21). The struc-
ture with the lowest E-value is retrieved from the PDB and its
dihedral angles are calculated by VADAR (20). Torsion
angles are mapped to the query sequence using the sequence
alignment provided by BLAST. c1 angles are not assigned
to Gly and Ala residues. In addition, a f angle of 65 is
mapped on to Pro regardless of the values of homology-
predicted angles.
Prior to merging shift-based and homology-based predic-
tions, the error limits (for f/y angles) and confidence
scores (for f, y, c1) angles are calculated for each method
as described below. Predictions with higher confidence
scores or lower error limits are given precedence over pre-
dictions with lower confidence scores or higher error limits.
However, if shift-derived torsion angles of four or more
consecutive residues are significantly different (>60) from
PDB-derived values, the shift-based predictions are given
precedence. When homology-based predictions are not pos-
sible, the shift-derived predictions are used. The selection
of either homology-based predictions or shift-based predic-
tions is also determined by ‘switch points’ implemented in
the program. The rationale for adding the switch points was
our observation that accuracy of predicted angles decreases
significantly with increase of beta-sheet content in proteins
and reduction of sequence identity of the homologue
identified by BLAST (27). These data are shown in
PREDITOR’s help pages. The switch points were obtained
empirically by thorough analysis of these dependencies and
are listed in Web Table 2 on PREDITOR’s help page.
PREDITOR assigns an error to each predicted f/y torsion
angle by combining its confidence scores with predicted or
identified secondary structures and local sequence identity.
The relationship to confidence scores and estimated f/y tor-
sion angle errors are listed in Web Table 3 of PREDITOR’s
Help page. These error values were determined empirically
by attempting to minimize both the size of the assigned
error and the number of erroneous predictions with high
(0.7) confidence values. Generally speaking residues in
helices have smaller errors than beta strands and f angles
have smaller errors than y angles. Confidence scores in
PREDITOR are calculated using the following formula:
C ¼ 2ð3*Sði‚ jÞ/239Þ**2 2
W66 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Web Server issue
Where C is the confidence score and S(i,j) is the similarity
score calculated in Equation 1. The confidence scores depend
on both the sequence and chemical shift similarity of the
query protein sequence triplets to the corresponding sequence
triplets found in the PREDITOR database. This formula pro-
duces values that range from 0.0 to 1.0 (with 1.0 having the
highest confidence). Roughly speaking a PREDITOR confid-
ence rating 0.7 corresponds to the TALOS rating of ‘good’,
a rating below 0.4 corresponds to a TALOS rating of ‘bad’
and between 0.4 and 0.6 is considered ‘ambiguous’. With
the homology search turned off, PREDITOR predictions hav-
ing a confidence score 0.7, have an error rate that is slightly
>3%. Typically 60–65% of PREDITOR predictions (with the
homology search turned off) have a confidence score 0.7.
This is essentially identical to the performance reported for
TALOS (17). With PREDITOR’s PDB-homology search
turned on, the error rate is similar (3%) but the percentage
of accepted predictions is 15% greater. Likewise, for PDB-
based predictions the error limits are generally several
degrees smaller. Note also that when PDB homologues are
found the confidence scores vary with the local sequence
identity of the PDB homologue (see PREDITOR’s Help
page for more details).
PREDITOR uses a probabilistic hypersurface model (34)
to estimate the confidence of c1 prediction from chemical
shifts. As with the f/y torsion angles the confidence values
for c1 angle predictions vary between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0
being the highest level. Confidence levels of homology-
based predictions of c1 have been derived empirically from
the dependence of prediction accuracy on the level homo-
logue sequence identity. Confidence levels derived from
PDB homologues are shown in Web Table 4 on PREDI-
TOR’s Help page. When assignments for fewer than six nuc-
lei (Ca, Cb, CO, Ha, N and HN) are available, the predicted
torsion angle error is multiplied by a scaling factor (see Web
Table 5 on PREDITOR’s Help page). These scaling factors
were determined for each of the 63 possible assignment com-
binations by measuring the average increase of PREDITOR’s
prediction errors for each of these combinations in the
PREDITOR database.
VALIDATION
PREDITOR was optimized, tested and evaluated on a training
set of 141 proteins (20 489 residues), for which complete or
nearly complete 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts were known
and for which high quality PDB structures were available
(Web Table 6 on the PREDITOR help page). To evaluate
the performance of the algorithm for the training set, we
used a leave-one-out procedure by removing a query protein
from PREDITOR database prior to running the algorithm.
The accuracy of the predictions, D(f/y), was determined
using the following equation:
Dðf/yÞi ¼ ðjfobs  fpredjÞ þ ðjyobs  ypredjÞ 3
where fobs and yobs are observed and fpred and ypred are pre-
dicted f and y angles, respectively. If the D(f/y) value for
residue i was <30 (denoted as f/y[30]) the prediction was
considered ‘correct’. To estimate accuracy c1 angles, the
observed and predicted c1 angles were grouped into trans,
gauche+ and gauche these three categories. Predictions
are considered to be correct if both predicted and observed
c1 angles belonged to the same rotamer group. The overall
performance for D(f/y) or c1 was determined by calculating
percentage of correctly identified torsion angles from their
total number in a given protein. The measurement of w
angle accuracy was based on a similar protocol and the per-
formance of the program to predict and identify the 15 cis
peptide bonds in the training set.
The average f/y[30] accuracy for the full version of
PREDITOR on this 141 protein training set was 90.3%.
The accuracy for PREDITOR using shift-derived predictions
alone was 67.4%. The average c1 accuracy was 83.8%
(versus 64.4% for shift-only derived predictions), while the
w accuracy was 99.98% for trans peptide bond identifica-
tion and 93% for cis peptide bond identification. To assess
PREDITOR’s relative performance against TALOS a
subset of 31 of the 141 proteins were also analyzed by
TALOS. The results of this comparison, both in terms of
accuracy and computational speed are summarized in Sup-
plementary Table A (See the Supplementary Data and

These data indicate that PREDITOR is substantially faster
(37·) and 20.2% more accurate than TALOS.
To test the program further and to ensure that the
PREDITOR algorithms had not been over-trained or become
biased. an independent test set of 15 randomly chosen
proteins (2665 residues) not found in either the TALOS or
PREDITOR training set was analyzed by both PREDITOR
and TALOS. As seen in Table 1, PREDITOR is 18% more
accurate than TALOS for f and y predictions, when both
PDB-derived and shift-based predictions are used. When
only chemical shifts are used PREDITOR is 4% more accur-
ate than TALOS. The average PREDITOR run takes 37.5
CPU seconds while the average TALOS run is 1305 CPU
seconds on the same 2.6 GHz processor. These results are
essentially identical to the results seen in Supplementary
Table A.
In summary, PREDITOR is a web server that is capable to
rapidly obtain accurate estimates of f, y, c1 and w torsion
angles, including their error limits and confidence levels,
using only chemical shift assignments or protein sequence
as input data. Comparisons suggest that these estimates are
as good or better than what can be obtained using existing
methods and that the approach used here is generally applic-
able to any protein for which 1H, 13C and 15N shift assi-
gnments are available. In addition to its speed and high
level of performance PREDITOR also offers other unique
features including dihedral angle prediction via PDB struc-
ture mapping, automated chemical shift re-referencing
(to improve accuracy), prediction of proline cis/trans states,
automated generation of XPLOR, CYANA, AMBER or
CNS torsion angle restraint output and a simple-to-use web-
based user interface. Because of its improved accuracy and
extended capabilities, we believe PREDITOR may lead to
important changes in general NMR structure determination
protocols, allowing more users to place tighter constraints
and/or more weight on torsion angle restraint data.
