ABSTRACT
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used anticancer drug
thatdisruptspyrimidinenucleotidepool balances and
leads to uracil incorporation in DNA, which is then
recognized and removed by the uracil base excision
repair (BER) pathway. Using complementary bio-
chemical and genetic approaches we have examined
the role ofuracilBER in thecell killing mechanism of5-
FU. A yeast strain lacking the enzyme uracil DNA glyc-
osylase (Ung1), which excises uracil from the DNA
backbone leaving an abasic site, showed significant
protection against the toxic effects of 5-FU, a G1/S cell
cycle arrest phenotype, and accumulated massive
amounts of U/A base pairs in its genome (4% of T/
A pairs were now U/A). A strain lacking the major aba-
sic site endonuclease of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Apn1) showed significantly increased sensitivity to
5-FU with G2/M arrest. Thus, efficient processing of
abasic sites by this enzyme is protective against the
toxic effects of 5-FU. However, contrary to expecta-
tions, the Apn1 deficient strain did not accumulate
intact abasic sites, indicating that another repair path-
way attempts to process these sites in the absence
Apn1, but that this process has catastrophic effects
on genome integrity. These findings suggest that new
strategies for chemical intervention targeting BER
could enhance the effectiveness of this widely used
anticancer drug.
INTRODUCTION
The prodrug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Figure 1A) has historically
been used to treat varied types of malignancies including
colorectal, breast, and head and neck cancers. In the year
2002, 5-FU was given to over 2 million patients worldwide
making it one of the most widely used anticancer drugs (1,2).
The mechanism of 5-FU involves enzymatic conversion to the
active metabolite 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate
(FdUMP) which covalently inhibits thymidylate synthase
(TS), an essential enzyme responsible for synthesizing deoxy-
thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) from deoxyuridine mono-
phosphate (dUMP) (Figure 1A) (3). This is the major de novo
pathway by which the cell produces thymidine precursors for
DNA replication, and it is widely accepted that depletion of
thymidine nucleotides for DNA synthesis following 5-FU
treatment directly results in 5-FU cell killing (‘thymineless
death’) (4).
Although the thymineless death mechanism is attractive in
its simplicity, recent evidence suggests a more complex scen-
ario involving pyrimidine nucleotide balances (5,6), DNA
repair pathways and disruptions in RNA metabolism
(4,7–9). For example, consider that inhibition of TS by 5-
FU not only depletes the dTTP pool within the cell, but
also increases the pools of dUTP and FdUTP that can be
incorporated during DNA replication (Figure 1A). Although
under normal conditions uracil is excluded from DNA by
maintaining a low cellular dUTP pool through the action of
deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase),
upon TS inhibition large amounts of dUTP and FdUTP accu-
mulate which overwhelms the dUTPase activity. Thus, dUMP
and FdUMP are incorporated into genomic DNA, which may
directly lead to cytotoxicity either by causing mutations and
resulting protein miscoding (10), or by triggering apoptosis
(11). Alternatively, the presence of uracil and 5-FU in DNA
may result in ‘futile cycling’ of uracil base excision repair
(BER) because of the depleted dTTP pool (Figure 1B). In this
case, the unwanted uracil base is removed by uracil DNA
glycosylase (Ung1), the DNA backbone is nicked by an abasic
endonuclease, the blocking 50 deoxyribose phosphate is
removed by a flap endonuclease (Rad27) and the resulting
gap is filled in using another dUMP or FdUMP residue through

the action of a repair DNA polymerase (pol e) and DNA ligase
(cdc9) (Figure 1B). During this cycling, there may be an
accumulation of toxic intermediates such as abasic sites,
single-strand breaks (SSBs) or double-strand breaks (DSBs)
in the DNA, any of which may promote cell death (Figure 1B)
(12). In addition to these DNA-based routes that promote 5-FU
toxicity, at very high concentrations FUTP is also extensively
incorporated into RNA, thereby inhibiting processing of pre-
rRNA (13–15), post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs
(16,17), and polyadenylation and splicing of mRNA
(18,19). Despite its use in the clinic for over 40 years, the
relative importance of these potential mechanisms for 5-FU-
mediated cell killing is not clearly established. Understanding
the salient mechanisms is of significant interest because
novel targets for therapeutic development may be uncovered
that could enhance the clinical efficacy of 5-FU and related
fluoropyrimidines (20).
A potential approach to enhance the DNA-based mechan-
isms of 5-FU-mediated cell killing is to identify the toxic
intermediates during uracil BER, and then develop small
molecule inhibitors of downstream enzymes, leading to accu-
mulation of the lethal intermediate. For instance, if accumu-
lation of uracil or 5-FU in DNA is the trigger for cell death,
then inhibition of the first step of BER catalyzed by Ung1
would be effective (Figure 1B). Alternatively, if the accumu-
lation of abasic sites or DNA nicks is critical for toxicity, then
inhibition of the subsequent steps of BER would potentially be
the most productive route. Although it seems counterintuitive
to inhibit processes of DNA repair, such a strategy could allow
targeting of rapidly dividing cells in a sea of quiescent normal
cells. Since up regulation of BER enzymes has been implic-
ated in the resistance mechanisms and progression of various
tumor cells (21–24), inhibitors of BER could also target one
mechanism of drug resistance. The same inhibition strategy
could be used to target pathogenic microorganisms such as the
fungus Candida albicans, herpesviruses, and parasites from
the Trypanosomatidae family (such as Leishmania major and
Trypanosoma cruzi), all of which depend on stringent pyrimi-
dine nucleotide pool balance for viability (25–27).
The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an ideal
organism to investigate the importance of uracil BER in 5-
FU toxicity because deletion yeast strains in most steps of this
process are available (pole and cdc9 are lethal deletions), as
well as other DNA repair pathways, and the yeast pathway is
closely related to that in humans (28). Thus, the important
intermediates and enzymes that enhance (or diminish) the
potency and efficacy of 5-FU can be ascertained. Using com-
plementary biochemical and genetic approaches we find that
deletion of uracil DNA glycosylase, with a resultant massive
increase in uracilated DNA, has a protective effect against
5-FU. In contrast, deletion of the major abasic site endonuc-
lease of yeast (Apn1) results in a large increase in the potency
and efficacy of 5-FU. Thus, abasic sites appear to be a major
progenitor giving rise to the DNA-mediated toxic effects of 5-
FU. The significance of these findings to cancer chemotherapy
is considered.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Yeast media and growth conditions
Wild-type yeast were grown in YEPD [1% yeast extract,
2% peptone (BD Biosciences), 2% dextrose (J. T. Baker)];
mutant strains in YEPD supplemented with 200 mg/ml gene-
ticin (Gibco). Selection for fresh MATa single mutants was
performed as described (29) using sporulation buffer (1%
KOAc, 0.005% ZnOAc; Sigma) and MATa selective ‘magic
medium’ (SC-Leu-His-Arg+L-canavanine (60 mg/ml) + gene-
geneticin; all amino acids and L-canavanine from Sigma,
yeast nitrogenous base without amino acids and ammonium
sulfate from Difco). The apn1 and quadruple mutants derived
from FF18733 and rad27 yeast prepared using a URA3 dele-
tion cassette were plated on the appropriate selective media
(Supplementary Table S1).

function through inhibition of TS and disruption of nucleotide pool balance or the direct incorporation of 5-fluoronucleotides into DNA and RNA. (B) Although it has
been hypothesized that uracil BER plays an important role in mediating 5-FU toxicity, the lethal intermediate along this pathway remains to be identified. Possible
intermediates moving clockwise around the cycle are the mutagenic 5-FU base itself, the abasic product of the Ung1 reaction, or various incised products derived from
the intact abasic site (see text).

strain BY4741. Homozygous and convertible heterozygous
mutants were supplied courtesy of Dr Jef Boeke. All mutations
of strain BY4741 were confirmed via PCR using primers as
described by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project
(30). The apn1 (strain BG1) and apn1apn2ntg1ntg2 (strain
BG105) yeast and their parental strain (FF18733) were
gifts of Dr Serge Boiteux and were verified for auxotrophy.
The complete genotypes of these strains are reported in
Supplementary Table S1.
5-FU survival time courses
Yeast were grown to logarithmic phase and diluted to
5 · 106 cells/ml into YEPD +/ 150 mM 5-FU (Sigma)
based on a preliminary estimate of the EC50 of 5-FU for
the parental BY4741 strain. At given times, cells were diluted,
plated and incubated at 30C until countable colonies had
formed. Colony counting was assisted with the use of a Gel
Doc imaging system (BioRad), and data were plotted using
GraphPad Prism.
5-FU dose-response studies
Yeast were grown to logarithmic phase and diluted to
5 · 106 cells/ml into media containing varying concentrations
of 5-FU. After 4 h of shaking at 30C, the cells were diluted,
plated and incubated until counting. Data were plotted and
EC50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism.
Flow cytometry
Yeast were grown to logarithmic phase, diluted to
5 · 106 cells/ml into media +/150 mM 5-FU, and prepared
for flow cytometry as described previously (31). Briefly, at
given time intervals, 5 · 106 cells were pelleted, washed and
resuspended in 250 ml sterile water. Cold 100% ethanol was
added to 70%, with vortexing. The cells were allowed to fix
overnight at 4C before being washed and resuspended in
100 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 (Fisher), and digested
with 100 mg/ml RNase A at 37C for 2 h. Additional buffer and
propidium iodide (10 mg/ml final concentration; Sigma) were
added, and samples were stored at 4C in the dark. Flow
cytometry was carried out using a FACScan cytometer
(Beckton–Dickinson), and data were analyzed with Cell
Quest software.
Analysis of U and 5-FU in DNA and RNA
Yeast were grown to logarithmic phase, diluted to
5 · 106 cells/ml into media +/ 150 mM 5-FU, and incubated
for varying times (wt, 6 h, ung1, 6 h, apn1, 3 h) at 30C with
agitation in order to kill 70–90% of the wt and apn1 cells and
achieve maximum cell killing with the ung1 yeast at this 5-FU
concentration. Small aliquots were diluted and plated, and the
remaining cells were spun down, lysed with lyticase (Sigma)
and genomic DNA was isolated using Genomic-tips (Qiagen).
Each sample (3 mg) was digested overnight at room temper-
ature with 3 nM Escherichia coli uracil DNA glycosylase
(Ung) and 3 nM human AP endonuclease (Ape1) in buffer
containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM
NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2. Half of each reaction was run on a
0.8% agarose gel, which was stained with 1 mg/ml EtBr prior
to imaging.
For GC-MS, yeast cells were grown to logarithmic phase
and diluted to 5 · 106 cells/ml into 5-FU to achieve 70–90%
cell killing across all samples (wt, 150 mM 5-FU for 6 h, ung1,
3 mM 5-FU for 4 h, and apn1, 150 mM 5-FU for 3 h). Aliquots
were diluted and plated, and the genomic DNA was purified
and digested with 10 nM Ung overnight at room temperature in
buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2
and 25 mM NaCl. Following digestion, aliquots of uracil-13C4,
15N2 and 5-FU-
13C4,
15N2 were added as internal standards
(stable isotope labeled U and 5-FU were purchased from Cam-
bridge Isotope Laboratories). Then the DNA was precipitated
with 70% EtOH, centrifuged and the supernatant and pellet
fractions were separated. Ethanol was removed from super-
natant fractions under vacuum in a SpeedVac at room
temperature. Aqueous supernatant fractions were frozen in
liquid nitrogen, lyophilized to dryness for 18 h, and then
trimethylsilylated and analyzed by GC-MS as described
(32–34). For identification and quantification, selected-ion
monitoring was used to monitor the characteristic ions of
the trimethylsilyl derivatives of uracil (m/z 256 and m/z 241),
uracil-14C4,
15N2 (m/z 262 and m/z 247), 5-FU (m/z 274 and m/z
259) and 5-FU-13C4,
15N2 (m/z 280 and m/z 265) during GC/
MS analysis. (In each case, the first ion is the molecular ion
and the second one is the ion that results from the loss of
methyl radical from the molecular ion.)
For RNA 5-FU incorporation analysis, wt yeast were
grown to logarithmic phase, diluted to 5 · 106 cells/ml into

Cellular RNA was then isolated using the RNeasy Kit

(10 U) overnight at 37C in buffer containing 10 mM Tris–

isocratic elution with 3% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1 M TEAA,
pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
Aldehyde reactive probe slot-blot (ASB) assay
Yeast were grown to logarithmic phase, diluted to
5 · 106 cells/ml into YEPD +/ one EC50 of 5-FU, and shaken
for 6 h at 30C. The DNA was isolated using Genomic-tips
(Qiagen) and subjected to the ASB assay as described (35–37).
Briefly, 4 mg of each DNA sample was digested with E.coli
exonuclease III (145 U; New England Biolabs) for 1 min
at 37C, 100 mM putrescine at 37C for 30 min (Acros
Organics), both exonuclease III and putrescine, or left undi-
gested. All samples were precipitated with EtOH, resuspended
in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1 mM
aldehyde reactive probe (ARP; Dojindo Laboratories) for
10 min at 37C. Following a second precipitation, the DNA
was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4 and
1 mM EDTA), quantified by ethidium bromide spotting, and
0.5 mg of each sample was diluted to a volume of 100 ml in TE,
heat denatured and mixed with an equal volume of 20· SSC
(3 M NaCl and 0.3 M sodium citrate). The denatured DNA was
slot-blotted onto Hybond-C Super nitrocellulose (Amersham
Biosciences) using a Minifold II slot-blot manifold (Schleicher
& Schuell). The membrane was soaked in 5· SSC for 15 min at
37C, dried, baked at 75C under vacuum for 2 h, and then
rewet and blocked in 10 ml of preincubation buffer (20 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% casein,
0.25% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20) for 45 min at room temper-
ature, with shaking. An additional 10 ml of prehybridization
buffer containing a 1:500 dilution of streptavidin conjugated–
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added to the membrane,
and following an additional 40 min of shaking at room tem-
perature, the membrane was reacted with enhanced chemilu-
minescence (ECL) reagents and imaged using Hyperfilm
(streptavidin-HRP, ECL reagents and film from Amersham
Biosciences). The films were analyzed using a Gel Doc System
(Bio-Rad), and data were plotted using GraphPad Prism.
Quantification was based on abasic site DNA standards pur-
chased from Dojindo Laboratories.
RESULTS
General strategy
Many cancer chemotherapeutic strategies act by damaging
DNA in various ways and therefore elicit a cellular DNA
damage response that either repairs the damage, or alternat-
ively, generates toxic repair intermediates that may be the true
progenitors of drug-induced lethality. Our general strategy to
examine the role of uracil BER in the mechanism of 5-FU
toxicity is to use yeast strains deficient in various enzymatic
steps of the pathway, thereby unmasking repair intermediates
that may be progenitors of cell death (Figure 1B and Table 1).
In addition, we sought to support the genetic results with
quantitative analyses of uracil and 5-FU in DNA to determine
the load of uracilated DNA in wild-type and the Ung1 and
Apn1 deficient yeast, both in the absence and presence of
5-FU. In a final analytical approach, we determine the number
of intact and cleaved abasic sites in the presence and absence
of 5-FU treatment for wild-type, ung1 and apn1 yeast. To
investigate the possibility of alternative processing of abasic
sites by other AP endonucleases or lyases, we also examined
the yeast strain apn1apn2ntg1ntg2, which is defective in all
pathways for endonucleolytic cleavage of abasic sites opposite
to adenine bases (Table 1). Although the focus of this study is
on uracil BER, the findings also necessitated an examination
of potential backup roles for DSB repair, nucleotide excision
repair (NER) and mismatch repair pathways, and an assess-
ment of 5-FU incorporation into RNA. Combining both gen-
etic and biochemical approaches allows assessment of the
discrete molecular events that are most strongly correlated
with the lethal effects of 5-FU treatment.
5-FU survival time courses for wild-type and
BER deficient yeast
To investigate the influence of uracil BER enzyme activities
on sensitivity to 5-FU, the survival curves of these yeast strains
were measured in the absence and presence of the drug. In the
absence of 5-FU, all uracil BER deficient strains exhibited
indistinguishable doubling times over a 6 h growth period
(not shown). Exceptions were the rad51 and rad27 strains
that had doubling times about 1.5 times longer. In the presence
of 150 mM 5-FU, a concentration similar to the EC50 for the
wild-type parent yeast strain (see below), marked differences
in survival were observed (Figure 2A). The ung1 strain, which
is deficient in the removal of uracil and 5-FU, showed marked
protection against 5-FU as compared with the wild-type strain,
and it was not possible to achieve any greater than about
60% killing even after 54 h of treatment using this concen-
tration of 5-FU. In contrast, the apn1 strain that is deficient in
cleavage of the 50 phosphodiester linkage of the abasic site
product of the Ung1 reaction showed rapid and complete cell
killing (Figure 2A). The log linear survival time course with-
out lags for this strain suggests the rapid formation of a toxic
species from 5-FU. For the rad27 strain, which is deficient in
the 50-dRPase activity required to process the 50-incised abasic
sites generated from Apn1 action, a strong protection against
5-FU was observed similar to ung1 (Figure 2A).
It should be noted that this protective rad27 phenotype was
only observed for a haploid strain that was freshly prepared
from a convertible heterozygote (29). In contrast, we found
that an older rad27 strain showed similar sensitivity to 5-FU as
compared with the wild type (data not shown). Our results with
the older strain are similar to a recent report in which antifolate
drugs were used to deprive yeast of thymidine (i.e. modest or
no effect of the rad27 deletion on survival was observed) (38).
These results emphasize that care must be taken when dealing
with deletion yeast strains that show genetic instability and
slow growth due to defects in DNA repair. Since rad27 acts
downstream of apn1 in BER (Figure 1B), it would be expected
that the phenotype of the apn1rad27 double mutant would

recapitulate the 5-FU sensitivity of apn1 alone. Surprisingly,
this was not the case, as apn1rad27 showed the same protect-
ive phenotype as rad27 (not shown).
The above findings suggest the following conclusions (i) the
protective effect of the ung1 deletion indicates that accumu-
lation of uracil or 5-FU in DNA is not responsible for the toxic
effects of 5-FU, (ii) the increased 5-FU sensitivity of the apn1
strain indicates that efficient 50 endonucleolytic processing of
abasic sites plays an important role in cell survival in the
presence of 5-FU, and (iii) the protective effect of deleting
the 50-dRPase activity provided by Rad27 suggests that single-
nucleotide gapped DNA generated by this enzyme is more
toxic than the 50-dRp group itself, or alternatively, that another
toxic species is derived from this product. Of course, an
unknown effect of deleting Rad27 that is unrelated to its
enzymatic activity cannot be excluded from these studies.
Role of alternative repair pathways
Although Apn1 is known to be the major abasic site endonuc-
lease in S.cerevisiae (39), it was possible that other enzymes
capable of catalyzing strand breaks at abasic sites were acting
as surrogates to initiate repair of abasic sites in the absence of
Apn1. To investigate this possibility, the survival curve for the
apn1apn2ntg1ntg2 quadruple mutant which lacks all known
enzymes capable of nicking the DNA backbone 50 or 30 to
abasic sites opposite to adenine bases was measured (Figure 2B
and also Table 1). Since this quadruple deletion mutant was
constructed using a different wild-type strain that is less sens-
itive to 5-FU (FF18733; Figure 2B), we also measured the
survival curve for the apn1 mutant in this genetic background.
The FF18733 wild-type strain showed 70% survival at 24 h
incubation with 150 mM 5-FU, while the apn1 and apn1
apn2ntg1ntg2 strains showed increasing sensitivities (40 and
2% survival, respectively). Thus, these results support the pro-
posal that processing of abasic sites by Apn1 is important for
initiating productive repair of 5-FU generated abasic sites, and
that Apn2 and/or Ntg1 and Ntg2 can play a backup role.
To investigate a role for homologous recombination (HR)
in ameliorating the toxicity of 5-FU, the survival curve for the
rad51 strain was also measured (Figure 2C). Rad51 is the
yeast homolog for the bacterial RecA protein, which is critical
for HR, but this deletion had no effect on the time dependence
and only a small effect on 5-FU efficacy at 8 h as compared
with the wild-type strain. However, after 24 h incubation with
5-FU the rad51 strain showed about 10-fold greater survival
than BY4741. This increasing protection as a function of
time, with a pronounced lag phase (Figure 2C), suggests
that HR plays a modest role in drug-induced lethality, but
that the mechanism requires time-dependent accumulation
of recombinogenic intermediates. This time course differs
considerably from apn1 that shows log linear killing with
no lags (Figure 2A).
A role for the NER pathway was examined using the rad2
yeast strain (Figure 2D). Rad2 is a single-stranded DNA endo-
nuclease that nicks the DNA backbone 30 to a damaged site,
and is the yeast homolog of the human XPG protein (40,41). In
contrast, with the BER deletion strains, rad2 showed an indis-
tinguishable survival curve from that of the wild-type strain
BY4741 as did the mismatch repair-deficient strain msh2
(Figure 2D). We conclude that deletions in the BER pathway
have the largest effects on 5-FU toxicity.

strain. (C) HR deficient rad51 yeast are modestly protected against 5-FU as compared with wild-type yeast. (D) The NER and mismatch repair-deficient rad2 and

5-FU dose-response studies
The above survival time courses indicated that the ung1, apn1
and apn1apn2ntg1ntg2 deletion strains had significant effects
on 5-FU induced cell death. We therefore examined the dose-
response curves for the wild-type strain and these mutants after
4 h of growth in 5-FU containing media (Supplementary Data).
The BY4741 wild-type parent strain showed an EC50 of
110 ± 20 mM, which may be compared with the EC50 values
of 110 ± 37 mM and 22 ± 4 mM for the ung1 and apn1 deletion
strains, respectively. A key aspect of these dose-response
curves is that 100% killing is never achieved for the wild-
type or ung1 strains, but that the apn1 mutant shows both
complete killing and a 5-fold decrease in the EC50 value
for 5-FU as compared with wild-type. Similar findings were
observed with another yeast strain (FF18733) and its apn1 and
apn1apn2ntg1ntg2 deletion mutants. In this case, 60% killing
was observed for the wild-type strain (EC50 ¼ 400 ± 150mM),
while complete killing was observed for the single apn1
mutant and the quadruple mutant (EC50 ¼ 200 ± 30 mM
and 66 ± 8 mM, respectively). Thus, singular deletion of the
major abasic site endonuclease of yeast (Apn1) significantly
increases both the potency and efficacy of 5-FU, and further
deletion of the backup endonuclease (Apn2) and two AP
lyases (Ntg1, Ntg2) further increases potency.
To further examine possible roles for NER and mismatch
repair in 5-FU toxicity we examined the dose-response curves
for the rad2 and msh2 strains. In accord with their survival
curves (Figure 2D), rad2 and msh2 showed only a slightly
lower EC50 values as compared with BY4741, providing
no evidence for a significant role of these pathways in repair
of 5-FU induced lesions.
Cell cycle responses to 5-FU
Flow cytometry was used to examine the cell cycle distribution
of wild-type and the ung1 and apn1 yeast strains (Figure 3). In
the absence of 5-FU, the wild-type and the uracil BER defi-
cient strains showed no significant time-dependent changes in
their cell cycle distribution over 8 h, with the exception of a
slight increase in the G1 population at the later time points
(upper panels, Figure 3A–C). In addition, the ung1 strain
showed a somewhat larger steady-state distribution of cells
in the G2 phase of the cell cycle as compared with the other
two strains (Figure 3B). Upon treatment with 150 mM 5-FU,
most of the wild-type cells arrested early in S phase as indic-
ated by an intermediate content of DNA (lower panel,
Figure 3A). The ung1 strain showed similar S phase arrest
as wild-type, although the mechanism may differ (lower panel,
Figure 3B). A dramatically different profile was observed for
the apn1 strain upon 5-FU treatment (lower panel, Figure 3C).
Unlike wild type or ung1, S phase arrest was bypassed, and
apn1 arrested in the G2 phase of the cycle, with significant
polyploidy and/or dead cells present. These findings indicate
a significant change in the cell killing mechanism of 5-FU
in the absence of Apn1 involving activation of a G2/M
checkpoint.
Uracil and 5-FU accumulation in DNA and RNA
Unlike humans, yeast have no other known enzymatic activity
that can remove uracil (or 5-FU) from DNA, and therefore,
deletion of Ung1 should completely block the removal of these
bases. Thus, the predicted outcome of the ung1 deletion is the
accumulation of uracil and/or 5-FU in DNA. In a preliminary
experiment to examine this prediction, we isolated genomic
DNA from the wild-type, ung1 and apn1 yeast after 6 h growth
in media containing 0 or 150 mM 5-FU. The DNA was then
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis before and after treat-
ment of the DNA with purified E.coli Ung and human AP
endonuclease (Ape1) (Figure 4). If a significant amount of
uracil had accumulated in the DNA of these samples, then
combined digestion with Ung/Ape1 would result in significant

DNA fragmentation, appearing as low molecular weight DNA
after electrophoretic analysis. This analysis revealed that the
wild-type and apn1 strains grown in the absence and presence
of 5-FU had no detectable low molecular weight DNA frag-
ments before or after Ung/Ape1 treatment. In contrast, the
ung1 strain showed a detectable amount of lower molecular
weight bands in the absence of 5-FU, and a large amount of
lower molecular weight products in the presence of 5-FU.
Indeed, under these 5-FU growth conditions about 50% of
the DNA migrated with fragment sizes <4 kb. These results
suggest a very high level of uracil or 5-FU incorporation in the
ung1 strain.
To more accurately quantify the amounts of uracil and 5-FU
incorporated into the genomes of these strains in the absence
and presence of 5-FU, we performed GC-MS analysis of the
uracil and 5-FU contents (Figure 5). All of the strains exhibited
similar levels of uracil when growth was performed in the
absence of 5-FU, suggesting that the dUTPase activity is suf-
ficient to keep dUTP levels low enough to preclude its incorp-
oration into DNA (Figure 5A). In the presence of 5-FU, the
wild-type and apn1 strains were still capable of keeping
genomic uracil levels as low as in the absence of 5-FU, exem-
plifying the high efficiency of uracil base excision by Ung1.
However, as suggested from the electrophoretic assay for
DNA fragmentation, the ung1 strain showed a 36-fold increase
in the genomic uracil content in the presence of 5-FU
(Figure 5A), indicating that about 1 in every 25 thymidine
bases (4%) is substituted with deoxyuridine under these con-
ditions. GC-MS analysis for 5-FU incorporation established
that in the absence of a uracil DNA glycosylase activity this
base is present at about 1/100 the levels of uracil (Figure 5B).
Thus, proposals that direct incorporation of 5-FU into DNA is
responsible for its toxic effects are not supported by these
findings.
Another possible outcome of 5-FU treatment is the incorp-
oration of 5-FUTP into RNA (see Figure 1A). To examine the
extent of incorporation, total cell RNA was isolated and sub-
jected to extensive enzymatic digestion with mung bean
nuclease and calf intestinal phosphatase followed by
reversed-phase HPLC analysis of the resulting nucleosides
(Figure 6). We reproducibly detected a very small amount
5-FUrd in RNA corresponding to 3% of the uridine that
was present. In other words, about 1 in every 30 uridine nuc-
leotides in RNA is replaced with 5-FUrd. This much higher
level of 5-FU in RNA as compared with DNA may reflect the
higher pool of cellular 5-FUTP as compared to FdUTP.
Analysis of abasic sites and DNA strand breaks
The large increase in potency and efficacy of 5-FU for the
apn1 and apn1apn2ntg1ntg2 strains suggests that abasic sites,
or some processed form of abasic sites, may potentiate the
lethal effects of 5-FU. To investigate this further, the total
number of genomic abasic sites as well the number of
50 and 30 nicked forms were measured after growth for 6 h
in the absence and presence of 5-FU (Figure 7). This analysis
was performed using the ASB assay which detects the ring
open aldehyde form of abasic sites by forming a covalent
Schiff base linkage with a reactive semicarbazide that is cova-
lently linked to biotin (35,42,43). Thus, sensitive detection is
afforded by chemiluminescence methods after covalently
derivatizing the DNA, fixing it to a nitrocellulose membrane,
and then probing with strepavidin-conjugated HRP. This assay
may also be combined with enzymatic analyses to ascertain
the fraction of the total abasic sites which are nicked on the

phoresis using an agarose gel. DSBs resulting from the enzymatic removal of U

weight fragments.

50 and 30 phosphodiester linkages. For instance, 30 nicks can be
detected using a 50 AP endonuclease (ExoIII) which com-
pletely severs the site from the DNA, precluding its binding
to nitrocellulose and chemiluminescence detection. Similarly,
50 nicks can be inferred by chemical cleavage of the 30 phos-
phodiester linkage using putrescine (35). It should be noted
that if rapid processing of sites occurs, then this assay will
grossly underestimate the flux of total abasic sites. In other
words, the assay is most informative if the rate-limiting pro-
cess is a step or steps involved in endonucleolytic turnover of
these sites.
ASB analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the BY4741
wild-type strain showed about 12 abasic sites per 106 bp in the
absence of 5-FU. Essentially all of these sites were nicked at
either the 50 or 30 sides, indicating that the initial abasic site
product of the Ung1 reaction is efficiently processed to these
nicked forms (upper panel, Figure 7A). The genomic DNA of
the ung1 strain showed 5-fold lower levels of abasic sites as
compared with the wild-type strain in the absence of 5-FU, and
essentially all of these were in the 50 nicked form (upper panel,
Figure 7B). An overall decrease in the steady-state load of
abasic sites is consistent with the expectation that abasic sites
generated from the excision of uracil or 5-FU would be dimin-
ished in the absence of Ung1, because it is the only known
enzyme in yeast capable of processing uracil lesions into aba-
sic sites. The remaining sites that are detected in the absence of
Ung1 must therefore arise from the action of other glyc-
osylases, or alternatively, from spontaneous hydrolysis of
the glycosidic linkage of DNA nucleotides. From comparing
the steady-state number of abasic sites in the wild-type and
ung1 strain under growth conditions in the absence of 5-FU,
we estimate that 80% of the total sites detected are derived
from the excision of uracil. Finally, the apn1 strain showed
similar levels of all abasic site forms as the wild-type strain in
the absence of 5-FU (upper panel Figure 7C), consistent with
the existence of effective alternative pathways for processing
these sites.
In the presence of 5-FU only modest changes in the levels of
intact and cleaved abasic sites were observed for the wild-type,
ung1 and apn1 strains: (i) the wild-type strain showed at most
a small decrease in the total number of abasic sites, all of
which were found in the two nicked forms (lower panel,
Figure 7A), (ii) the ung1 strain showed a modest 3-fold
increase in the number of abasic sites in the presence of
5-FU (lower panel, Figure 7B), and (iii) the apn1 strain
showed no significant change in abasic site levels as compared
with the absence of 5-FU (lower panel, Figure 7C). Compared
with the large flux of uracil through DNA as indicated from the
GC-MS and DNA fragmentation studies (Figures 4 and
5), these data provide no evidence for a large accumulation
of abasic sites arising from growth in the presence of 5-FU. An
inescapable conclusion is that the vast majority of these sites
are efficiently processed to strand gaps or DSBs irregardless of
the presence or absence of apn1.
DISCUSSION
Effects of 5-FU on genomic DNA
Despite the widespread use of 5-FU in cancer therapy, previ-
ous studies of BER in yeast and mammalian cell culture have
predominantly used the alkylating agent methylmethanesulf-
onate (MMS) to introduce base damage, primarily in the form
of 3-methyladenine and 7-methylguanine (44–46). Con-
sequently, the biological and biochemical effects of 5-FU
treatment have not been well characterized. Proposals invol-
ving mechanisms as diverse as incorporation of 5-FU into
RNA and DNA, or its disruption of nucleotide pool imbalances
have been invoked, with little data to support which effects
may give rise to its useful cytotoxicity (Figure 1A). Thus, the
studies performed here have tracked both the biochemical
consequences of growth in the presence 5-FU, and the
DNA repair mechanisms that are used to repair 5-FU induced
lesions.

concentrations relevant to the observed EC50 values for cell

standards.

killing and growth times equivalent to two doublings, is the
flux of large amounts of uracil (but not 5-FU) through DNA. In
addition, there is a significant incorporation of 5-FUTP into
RNA (see below and Figures 5 and 6). The flux through DNA
is revealed by the Ung1 deletion strain, which accumulates
uracil to a level corresponding to substitution of about 1 in
every 25 thymidines in the genome (Figure 5A). This contrasts
with the wild-type and Apn1 deficient yeast, which show no
significant increases in the uracil content of their DNA as a
consequence of growth in 5-FU containing media. Taken
together, these findings indicate that processing of uracil
sites is extremely efficient in the presence of Ung1, resulting
in no detectable increases in the uracil content even after 5-FU
treatment. In the absence of Ung1, uracil accumulates in DNA,
but this damage is less toxic to cells than the subsequent
processed forms arising from BER or other repair pathways
that may be operative in the wild-type strain (Figure 2A and
see also below).
Incorporation of 5-FU into RNA
A recent genome-wide screen of yeast heterozygotes revealed
5-FU induced perturbation of rRNA processing suggesting a
specific mechanism for its inhibition of cell growth that is
independent of its incorporation and removal from DNA
(47). We have measured a level for 5-FU in RNA of 1 in
30 U bases, which is similar to the ratio of U to T found in
DNA. Previous studies of 5-FU toxicity using brewers yeast
found much more extensive incorporation into RNA (75%
of the uracil residues were substituted) (48,49), a difference
that likely arises from the much higher concentrations of 5-FU
that were used in the previous work. With respect to mRNA
incorporation, the biological effects are likely to be of minor
consequence because translation of 5-FU containing mRNA is
apparently unhampered by this substitution, at least as reported
for a reticulocyte lysate translation system (50). In conclusion,
an rRNA-dependent pathway for 5-FU induced cell growth
inhibition may be important, but it should be considered in
parallel with the DNA repair path elucidated here.
Repair and toxicity of 5-FU induced DNA lesions
The high uracil flux through DNA in the presence of 5-FU
implies an equal flux of abasic sites, as well as 30 and 50 incised
abasic sites, but high steady-state levels of these lesions are not
observed, even in the apn1 strain (Figure 7). Given the pro-
tective effect of the Ung1 deletion against 5-FU toxicity, it
seems inescapable that a downstream repair intermediate aris-
ing from Ung1-catalyzed deglycosylation is responsible for
the toxic effects of this drug. In this regard, only one BER
enzyme we investigated, Apn1, gave rise to an increase in
5-FU toxicity (Figures 2A and 3B). The simplest interpretation
for these results is that Apn1 cleavage of the 50 phosphodiester,
either by directly acting on the intact abasic site, or by remov-
ing the 30-dRP group generated from AP lyase cleavage of the
30 phosphodiester, is critical for cell survival in the presence of
5-FU (28).
The data suggest a mechanistic basis for the increased 5-FU
toxicity observed with the Apn1 deletion mutant, and possible
backup pathways for repair (Figure 8). Naı¨ve intuition would
predict that removal of Apn1 would result in increased steady-
state levels of intact abasic sites. However, detailed measure-
ments of the levels of intact and cleaved abasic sites during
5-FU growth conditions revealed no detectable intact sites for
the Apn1 deletion strain, and instead, an increase in both 30 and
50 cleaved sites was observed as compared with the wild-type
strain (compare Figure 7A and C). This increase in cleaved
sites could imply that in the absence of Apn1, AP lyase cleav-
age on the 30 side occurs preferentially leading to a 30-dRP
group that is then inefficiently processed by the minor AP
endonuclease, Apn2. Such 30-blocked SSBs are strongly
implicated in the formation of DSBs and in the collapse of

replication forks, leading to activation of a RAD9-dependent
G2/M checkpoint (51,52). The observed G2/M cell cycle arrest
of Apn1 is consistent with this explanation.
The other post-glycosylase enzyme, Rad27, that removes
the 50-dRP group resulting from the Apn1 reaction, was unex-
pectedly found to be strongly protective against 5-FU toxicity
in both the wild-type and apn1 strains (Figure 2A). Since
50-dRP groups block ligation of the DNA strands, and are
converted into highly toxic DSBs after DNA replication, it
would seem essential that another repair pathway is operative
in this mutant. One bypass pathway would be cleavage on the
30 side of the intact abasic site by Ntg1 or Ntg2, followed by
removal of the 30-dRP group by Apn1 or Apn2 (Figure 8), as
implicated previously for yeast grown in the presence of MMS
(53,54). Why this alternative path, or other additional backup
pathways such as NER (Figure 8), would result in greater
resistance to 5-FU for the Rad27 deletion strain is not obvious.
The protective or null effect of the rad27 deletion to both 5-FU
and antifolate drugs (38), both of which result in thymidine
deprivation, differs from the MMS sensitizing effect of this
deletion (55). Thus, it appears that the damage response to
uracilated and methylated DNA differs even after the glyc-
osylase step. Assuming that the 5-FU protective phenotype of
the rad27 strain arises from removal of its enzymatic activity,
then deletion of the next enzyme in the pathway (pol e) could
produce hypersensitivity to 5-FU if the immediate product of
the Rad27 reaction is toxic. However, since pol e is essential
this could not be tested. The toxic intermediates and DNA
repair pathways implicated in 5-FU-mediated cell killing are
summarized in the legend to Figure 8.
Our results extend upon two previous studies that investig-
ated the influence of uracil BER on the cytotoxicity induced by
two antifolate drugs aminopterin and sulfanilamide (12,38).
The first study focused largely on modulation of dUTP pools
by overexpression of dUTPase (Figure 1A), an activity which
was found to be strongly protective against the combined
cytotoxic effects of these dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors.
These previous findings suggested a pathway involving drug-
induced blockage of TTP synthesis and an increase in dUTP
pools leading to UNG-dependent DNA damage. The second
study used the same two antifolates and an apn1 strain to find
that deletion of Apn1 produced extreme sensitivity to these
agents (38). However in this previous study, deletion of Ung1
was not protective in the wild-type background, suggesting
that the observed cytotoxicity resulted at least in part from
effects other than deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA. This
is not unexpected since aminopterin and sulfanilamide have
widespread effects on both purine and pyrimidine nucleotide
pools, while 5-FU specifically targets TS. Nevertheless, pro-
cessing of abasic sites by Apn1 was found to be important both
in our work and this previous study.
Pharmacological implications
Toxicity studies in yeast now suggest a viable synergistic
approach for enhancing 5-FU cancer therapy involving manip-
ulation of both dUTP pools and DNA repair. Small molecule
inhibitors of human dUTPase could dramatically increase the
levels of dUTP in tumor cells, and consequently, increase
uracil incorporation into DNA. This could decrease the
dose of 5-FU required to give a clinical effect, and perhaps
diminish unwanted side effects. In addition, after excision of
uracil by Ung, inhibitors of the major human abasic endonuc-
lease (Ape1) could efficiently block the repair of abasic sites,
resulting in the massive accumulation of highly toxic lesions
that would lead to apoptosis or cell death. The synergistic
effect of a small molecule Ape1 inhibitor was recently demon-
strated in cell culture using several base-targeting agents (56).

Figure 8. DNA repair pathways implicated in 5-FU-mediated cell killing. The model is supported by the following observations: (i) a massive amount of uracil is
incorporated into DNA, but the ung1 yeast are much less sensitive to 5-FU than the wild-type strain indicating that uracilated DNA is not the mediator of 5-FU
toxicity; (ii) the apn1apn2ntg1ntg2 strain that is entirely defective in processing abasic sites by a BER mechanism is more sensitive to 5-FU, indicating that intact
abasic sites (or repair products derived from abasic sites) have inherent toxicity; and (iii) the rad27 and apn1rad27 yeast strains show protection against 5-FU toxicity,
suggesting the presence of a toxic repair intermediate downstream of the Rad27 flap endonuclease reaction. Several backup pathways for repair of abasic sites and
50dRp groups are indicated. The lower path involving Apn2 and other BER enzymes is important in the absence of Apn1 and accounts for the efficient removal of
abasic sites in the apn1 strain. NER and HR pathways are likely to be important with the apn1apn2ntg1ntg2 and rad27 knockout strains. Consistent with this, yeast
deficient in both BER and NER are not viable.
