[1] The Mangala Valles system of channels heads at one of the graben that comprise
Memnonia Fossae, extends northward nearly 1000 km across Noachian and Hesperian
highlands, and terminates at basins contiguous with Amazonis Planitia. The Mangala
Valles system has previously been interpreted to have formed through one or more
catastrophic aqueous floods on the basis of similarities between the characteristics of its
channel landforms and those of terrestrial systems, including the Channeled Scabland of
Washington. Although aqueous mechanisms for formation of Mangala Valles are broadly
congruous with known characteristics of the channel system, an alternative volcanic
hypothesis for formation of the system appears to be worthy of consideration on the basis
of (1) its consistency with the volcanotectonic nature of the system and (2) commonalities
between the basic nature of the system and that of large volcanic channels of the inner
solar system. Estimates based on thermal considerations suggest that formation of
Mangala Valles could conceivably have taken place through eruption of a lava volume of
2  105 km3, or roughly the total volume of the terrestrial Columbia River Basalt Group.
The volcanic hypothesis for formation of Mangala Valles, and a hybrid hypothesis
involving formation of Mangala Valles through aqueous processes followed by or in
concert with substantial modification of the system by volcanic erosion and deposition,
appears viable and worthy of future consideration.

1. Introduction
[2] The Mangala Valles outflow-channel system extends
almost 1000 km across Noachian and Hesperian highlands
of Memnonia, northward across the dichotomy boundary to
Amazonis Planitia (Figures 1 and 2) [e.g., Milton, 1973;
Baker and Milton, 1974; Carr, 1974b, 1981; Hartmann,
1974; Sharp and Malin, 1975; Mutch and Morris, 1979;
Baker, 1982; Chapman et al., 1989; Tanaka and Chapman,
1990; Zimbelman et al., 1992; Chapman and Tanaka,
1993]. As with numerous other outflow channels on Mars,
the Mangala Valles system is characterized by streamlined
landforms and complexly anastamosing reaches [e.g.,
Milton, 1973; Chapman and Tanaka, 1993]. The channel
system has a maximum width of 150 km, and heads at a
5-km-wide breach in the northern flank of a single
1500-km-long northeast-southwest trending graben.
This feature (Figure 1: G) is part of Memnonia Fossae,
which forms part of a large system of graben aligned
radially to Arsia Mons and that is hypothesized to have
formed through flexural loading, isostatic stresses, and/or
dike emplacement [Carr, 1974a; Wise et al., 1979; Plescia
and Saunders, 1982; McKenzie and Nimmo, 1999; Wilson
and Head, 2002; Me`ge et al., 2003; Schultz et al., 2004].
Although the main Mangala Valles system heads at a
graben, a hypothesized secondary source of fluids into the
Mangala Valles system, identified on the basis of scour and
subchannel features oriented radially to a prominent ridge
(Figure 1: C and R), is a thrust fault that intersects the
source graben nearly at right angles, east of the head of
Mangala Valles [Zimbelman et al., 1992].
[3] Partly on the basis of spatial variation in crater counts,
the Mangala Valles system has been previously hypothe-
sized to have formed through multiple flow events, some or
all of which may have been correlated in time with late-
Hesperian or Hesperian-Amazonian episodes of volcanism
and tectonism in the region [Tanaka and Chapman, 1990].
Regardless of the exact timing of the formation of Mangala
Valles, the system is generally interpreted to have formed by
catastrophic aqueous floods over a combined period of days
to thousands of days [e.g., see Ghatan et al., 2005].
[4] Floods at Mangala Valles are hypothesized to have
been driven by the hydraulic head associated with subsurface
waters confined by ground ice or other low-permeability
materials [e.g., Sharp and Malin, 1975; Tanaka and
Chapman, 1990; Zimbelman et al., 1992; Head and
Wilson, 2002; Ghatan et al., 2005]. One proposed scenario
for formation of Mangala Valles involves the melting of a
portion of a large near-surface body of ground ice in
permafrost by increases in Tharsis-related heat flow or by
upward displacement of the melting isotherm by the
emplacement of lava flows over an original frozen surface
[Zimbelman et al., 1992]. Another scenario involves fault-

driven release at the head of Mangala Valles from aquifers
pressurized under a confining cryosphere [Tanaka and
Chapman, 1990; see also McCauley et al., 1972; Carr,
1979], with faulting possibly related to the emplacement of
a Tharsis-radial dike swarm [Wilson and Head, 2002], and
an estimated total water release of 2  1013 m3 [Ghatan
et al., 2005; see also, e.g., Baker and Milton, 1974;
Komar, 1980; Baker, 1982; Zimbelman et al., 1992; Carr,
1996; Wilson et al., 2004]. A variation on this hypothesis
involves localized tectonic pressurization of aquifers
caused by formation of the source graben through cata-
strophic release of extensional crustal stress or through
forceful injection of dikes at depth [Hanna and Phillips,
2006].
[5] Hypotheses previously proposed to account for the
existence and characteristics of the Mangala Valles drainage
system rely upon aqueous mechanisms of formation that
involve the sudden release of large volumes of water from
the subsurface through fractures associated with the source
graben. These proposed mechanisms have substantial poten-
tial to account for the basic nature of the Mangala Valles
system. However, it is noteworthy that there are no satisfac-
tory analog processes, terrestrial or otherwise, for formation
of large systems of incised channels by the catastrophic
release of groundwater from fractures. Although proposed
aqueous mechanisms for formation of Mangala Valles are
congruous with known characteristics of the channel system,
an alternative volcanic hypothesis for formation of the system
appears worthy of consideration on the basis of its apparent
consistency with landforms interpreted as volcanic at Man-
gala Valles and on other solar system bodies. Terrestrial,
lunar, Venusian, and Martian landforms collectively suggest
that nonaqueous volcanic processes may be sufficient to
account for the existence and nature of the Mangala Valles
system, without the need to invoke the action of past
catastrophic aqueous flooding.
[6] This paper outlines a hypothesis for formation of the
channels of the Mangala Valles system through nonaqueous
volcanic processes. A summary of the geological setting of
Mangala Valles is presented, followed by a review of the
rationale behind previous aqueous interpretations of the
channel system. An alternative volcanic hypothesis for
formation of the channel system is outlined and discussed,
and quantifications of basic aspects of this hypothesis are
presented.
2. Geological Setting of Mangala Valles
[7] The graben at which the Mangala Valles system heads
is discontinuously exposed at the surface and is oriented in a
northeasterly direction, extending across Daedalia Planum
at the most distal western flanks of Arsia Mons and the
Tharsis rise [e.g., Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; see also,
e.g., Carr, 1974a; Scott and Zimbelman, 1995; Me`ge et al.,
2003]. At Daedalia Planum, the graben is partly covered by
lava flows [e.g., Tanaka and Chapman, 1990], some units
of which were erupted from the graben itself [Craddock and
Greeley, 1994; see also Wilson and Head, 2002]. The
graben is generally flat-floored and its morphology is

suggestive of formation by two inward-dipping normal
faults [e.g., Hanna and Phillips, 2006]. Although the main
graben mainly has widths of 2 km and depths of tens to
hundreds of meters, it is enlarged at the head of Mangala
Valles to a trough with widths of 7 km and depths of up to
1.5 km [Ghatan et al., 2005]. A 5 km wide notch in the
northern rim of this trough connects the graben to Mangala
Valles (Figure 1: H; Figure 3) [see also Carr, 1981].
[8] Dune-like ridges located within tens of kilometers of
the main source graben of Mangala Valles have been
previously interpreted to have formed through explosive
eruptions related to phreatomagmatic processes that preced-
ed large outpourings of groundwater hypothesized to have
formed the channels of Mangala Valles [Wilson and Head,
2004]. More prominent lobate-margined deposits located
adjacent to the main source graben (Figure 4) have been
previously interpreted to have formed by the outward flow
of ice lobes formed by the freezing of water emitted from
the graben [Head et al., 2004]. The span of the source
graben at its intersection with a highland ridge to the east of
the head of Mangala Valles (Figure 1: R; Figure 5a) is
defined in part by numerous collapse pits considered
suggestive of subsidence at a subgraben dike [Ghatan et
al., 2005]. Extensive plains to the east of these collapse pits
are interpreted to be composed of volcanic units that bury
the source graben of Mangala Valles, and partly consist of
flows erupted from the graben itself [e.g., Craddock and
Greeley, 1994; see alsoWilson and Head, 2002] (Figure 5b).
[9] Extensive smooth plains to the south of the graben
(Figure 1: P) have been previously interpreted to have
formed through aeolian or fluvial processes [Craddock
and Greeley, 1994], although more recent research suggests
that these plains are likely of volcanic origin, on the basis of
the distribution of similar plains in the vicinity of circum-
Tharsis ridges, their association with Tharsis volcanic flows,
the manner in which older topography is embayed by the
plains deposits, and the presence of features such as wrinkle
ridges and apparent flow fronts [Ghatan et al., 2005].
Similar volcanic interpretations have been made for other
ridged plains deposits located in the Mangala Valles region
[e.g., Chapman and Tanaka, 1993], and a general regional
association exists between volcanic plains and the Tharsis-
radial graben system [Wilson and Head, 2002]. The plains
to the south of the head of Mangala Valles (Figure 1: P) are
interpreted to have formed volcanically in conjunction with
the volcanic resurfacing of Noachian terrain to the north,
prior to the events that formed the channels of Mangala
Valles [Ghatan et al., 2005].
[10] The channels of Mangala Valles are incised into the
uplands of Memnonia, extending from the source graben
northward to the dichotomy boundary. The primary channel
network of Mangala Valles extends directly northward from
the source graben, whereas a major branch of the system,
Labou Vallis, reaches the dichotomy boundary by a north-
westward path [e.g., Chapman and Tanaka, 1993] (Figure 1:
M and L). The downstream gradient of most of the Mangala
Valles system is less than one degree, steepening only in the
vicinity of the dichotomy boundary (Figure 2) [see also,
e.g., Zimbelman et al., 1992, 1994; Ghatan et al., 2005].
Differences in crater-count ages within the Mangala Valles
system have previously been used to suggest that multiple
flow events formed its channels [Tanaka and Chapman,
1990], but it has been recently noted that measured channel
gradients are not necessarily consistent with such age
determinations [Ghatan et al., 2005]. It is also possible that
differences in crater statistics between reaches of Mangala
Valles instead reflect the sampling difficulties expected of
regions of relatively small areal extent [Zimbelman et al.,
1994].
[11] The Mangala Valles system is characterized by
abundant streamlined landforms and anastamosing reaches
[e.g., Milton, 1973; Baker and Milton, 1974; Baker, 1982;

Zimbelman et al., 1992, 1994; Chapman and Tanaka, 1993;
Ghatan et al., 2005] (Figures 6 and 7). These streamlined
landforms are aligned parallel to the flow paths of channels,
except for landforms located 130 km downslope from the
source graben that are oriented radially with respect to a
possible volcanic rise located east of the channel system
(Figure 1: C) [Zimbelman et al., 1992, 1994]. In contrast to
earlier interpretations of streamlined landforms as having
formed through the accumulation and erosion of alluvium
[e.g., Chapman and Tanaka, 1993; Zimbelman et al., 1994],
examination of more recently generated topographic and
image databases suggests that most or all such landforms
were generated through erosion of preexisting layered
volcanic units [Ghatan et al., 2005]. The relations between
streamlined and scoured landforms of Mangala Valles are
complex, and the relative timing of formation of such
landforms is in many cases unclear or even contradictory,
particularly in the numerous cases of cross-cutting scour
features [Ghatan et al., 2005; see also Zimbelman et al.,
1994].
[12] Longitudinal grooves discontinuously extend along
the floors of many channels of Mangala Valles (Figure 8)
[see also Chapman and Tanaka, 1993], and have been
previously interpreted at other Martian outflow channels
as having formed through the action of catastrophic flood-
ing or mud and debris flows [e.g., Baker and Milton, 1974;
Thompson, 1979]; other hypothesized mechanisms have
included aeolian processes [e.g., Sharp and Malin, 1975]
or glacial processes [e.g., Lucchitta et al., 1981; Lucchitta,
2001]. Some landforms that appear at relatively coarse
image resolutions as longitudinal grooves and ridges are
recognizable at higher resolutions instead as dune fields and
yardangs that in some cases deviate notably from channel
paths (e.g., MOC image M0806100). Similar aeolian land-
forms are also found in upland regions surrounding parts of
the Mangala Valles system (e.g., MOC images E1003072
and E1301768).
[13] Terraces are common along the margins of the
channels of Mangala Valles [Chapman and Tanaka, 1993]
(Figure 8), and in places several tens of stacked terraces are
evident [Ghatan et al., 2005]; such terraces have been
interpreted as having formed by erosion of layered volcanic
units deposited prior to or during formation of the channel
system, or having formed as fluvial depositional terraces
during the waning stages of aqueous flooding [e.g., see
Chapman and Tanaka, 1993; Ghatan et al., 2005]. Narrow
leveed subchannels are present along some reaches
of Mangala Valles, and a long (100 km) example has
been interpreted as a rille that likely acted as a conduit for
fluid volcanic flow (Figure 9) [Chapman and Tanaka,
1993].
[14] Plains units are discontinuously distributed through
much of the channel system (Figure 10). While some plains
materials have been interpreted as possible fluvial or lacus-
trine deposits [e.g., Chapman and Tanaka, 1993], many
such materials have been interpreted as volcanic flows on
the basis of their relatively high resistance to erosion and the
presence of features such as lobate margins and wrinkle
ridges [e.g., Zimbelman et al., 1992; Chapman and Tanaka,
1993; Ghatan et al., 2005]. Plains materials in and at the
mouths of the channels of Mangala Valles are in places
characterized by smooth surfaces pocked by quasi-circular
pits, as well as lobate and cuspate margins [e.g., Zimbelman
et al., 1992; Chapman and Tanaka, 1993; Ghatan et al.,
2005; Levy and Head, 2005] (Figure 11); these materials
have been interpreted as sublimation-lag deposits formed
Figure 4. Lobate-margined deposits (see arrows for flow
fronts) located adjacent to the main source graben of
Mangala Valles and interpreted by Head et al. [2004] as
having formed by freezing of water emitted from the graben

from ice-rich flood deposits [Levy and Head, 2005; see also
Zimbelman et al., 1992; Chapman and Tanaka, 1993].
Inverted channel topography evident along some reaches
(Figure 12) has been interpreted as the product of emplace-
ment of relatively resistant volcanic flows within these
reaches, followed by differential erosion of channel materi-
als [Chapman and Tanaka, 1993].
[15] Plains deposits, some of which have lobate margins
or pitted surfaces, are present at the mouths of Mangala
Valles channels at the dichotomy boundary. These deposits
have been interpreted as possible mudflow deposits and ice-
rich deposits, with more distal plains units interpreted as
volcanic on the basis of the presence of wrinkle ridges and
lobate margins [e.g., Chapman and Tanaka, 1993; see also
Scott and Tanaka, 1986]. Deposits of the Medusae Fossae
Formation extend across the terminal basins of Mangala
Valles, and are interpreted as possible airfall deposits of
volcanic origin [e.g., Bradley et al., 2002; Hynek et al.,
2003; see also Chapman and Tanaka, 1993].
[16] Dune and megaripple fields (e.g., MOC images
M0300429 and S0500890) overlay portions of Mangala
Valles, with coverage greatest within several hundred kilo-
meters of the dichotomy boundary. Much of the Mangala
Valles system and surrounding region is mantled by other
aeolian materials, as is indicated by the widespread presence
of wind streaks, dark talus streaks, and dust-devil tracks.
3. Evidence in Support of Aqueous Mechanisms
of Channel Formation at Mangala Valles
[17] Early studies of the outflow channels on Mars
concluded that the channels were incised by large aqueous
flows [e.g., Milton, 1973; Baker and Milton, 1974; Carr,
1974b; Sharp and Malin, 1975; Baker, 1978a; Baker and
Kochel, 1978a, 1978b, 1979; Komar, 1980; Mars Channel
Working Group, 1983], and subsequent studies of Mangala
Valles have been conducted in acceptance (and further
refinement) of these conclusions. The aqueous interpreta-
tion of Martian outflow channels is consistent with impor-
tant attributes of Mars: the polar caps are known to be partly
composed of water ice [e.g., Kieffer et al., 1976; Feldman et
al., 2003; see also Smith et al., 1999], voluminous near-
surface reservoirs of water have been inferred for high-
latitude regions using gamma-ray spectroscopy [Boynton et
al., 2002; see also, e.g., Farmer and Doms, 1979; Clifford
and Hillel, 1983], petrologic and chemical analyses of
meteorites interpreted as Martian have revealed the presence
of volatiles [e.g., Treiman, 1985; Karlsson et al., 1992], and
Martian landforms exist with characteristics suggestive of
formation by surface runoff or sapping [e.g., Milton, 1973;
Masursky et al., 1977; Baker, 1982; Goldspiel et al., 1993;
Mellon and Phillips, 2001; Moore et al., 2003; Hynek and
Phillips, 2003; Howard et al., 2005]. However, the strongest
evidence in support of the aqueous origins of Martian
outflow channels, including the Mangala Valles system,
relates to the similarity between the geomorphological
characteristics of these channel systems and those of terres-
trial systems known to have formed through processes
related to aqueous floods.
[18] Most notably, the landforms of the Channeled Scab-
land of Washington, a drainage system formed by cata-
strophic release of water from ice-dammed glacial Lake
Missoula [e.g., Bretz, 1928; Bretz et al., 1956; Baker,
1978b; Baker and Bunker, 1985; Smith, 1993], have been
cited as sharing key characteristics with Martian outflow
channels [Baker and Milton, 1974; Sharp and Malin, 1975;

units located east of the collapse pits, indicated by V, are interpreted as volcanic flood lavas, at least a

Baker, 1978c]. The conduits of both the Channeled Scab-
land and the Martian outflow channels are understood to
form networks of true channels, rather than networks of
valleys [Bretz, 1923, 1928; Milton, 1973; Baker and Milton,
1974]. Additionally, the shared characteristics of these
channel systems include the anastamosing nature and var-
iable widths of channels, the relatively high width-to-depth
ratios and low sinuosity of channels, the presence of
longitudinal grooves on channel floors and scour marks
around obstacles, the presence of inner channels with
recessional headcuts, and the presence of either depositional
or erosional streamlined forms on the down-current sides of
flow obstacles [Baker and Milton, 1974; Carr, 1974b;
Sharp and Malin, 1975; Baker, 1978a, 1978b, 1978c,
1982; Baker and Kochel, 1978a, 1978b; Mars Channel
Working Group, 1983].
[19] The Mangala Valles system itself shares a number of
key geomorphological characteristics with the Channeled
Scabland [e.g., Milton, 1973; Baker and Milton, 1974;
Sharp and Malin, 1975; Baker, 1982]. Large quadrilateral
residual forms, such as those that characterize the Cheny-
Palouse tract of the Channeled Scabland [Bretz, 1923; Bretz
et al., 1956; Baker, 1978b], are also found in many of the
channels of the Mangala Valles system (e.g., Figure 7)
[Milton, 1973; Carr, 1974b; Sharp and Malin, 1975;
Chapman and Tanaka, 1993]. The Channeled Scabland
residuals have lengths as great as tens of kilometers and
are mainly composed of basalt and loess deposits [e.g.,
Bretz, 1923; Baker, 1978b]. The Mangala Valles residuals
similarly have lengths as great as tens of kilometers, and
also may be composed of layered basalt units [Ghatan et al.,
2005]. The large quadrilateral streamlined landforms may in
both systems be erosional in origin [e.g., Baker, 1978b;
Ghatan et al., 2005], although some such landforms at
Mangala Valles have previously been classified as possible
depositional alluvial landforms [e.g., Baker, 1982; Chapman
and Tanaka, 1993; Craddock and Greeley, 1994]. The
complex anastamosing nature of the scabland channels is
mirrored by the channels of Mangala Valles, with conduits in
both systems defining the streamlined erosional residuals
through bifurcation and convergence around them [e.g.,
Milton, 1973; Carr, 1974b; Sharp and Malin, 1975; Baker,
1978b; Chapman and Tanaka, 1993].
[20] At the Channeled Scabland, there are numerous
subfluvially formed erosional transverse ledges that inter-
rupt the floors of deeply incised inner channels and that
acted as recessional cataracts to paleoflow [Bretz, 1928].

and smooth channel layers characterized by cuspate and

northwest. Channel plains such as those at R are interpreted
by Levy and Head [2005] as remnant ice from aqueous
floods that carved Mangala Valles. THEMIS VIS image;

[Chapman and Tanaka, 1993]. Similar channels are found
to the east on the distal flanks of Arsia Mons (e.g., THEMIS
VIS image V15820002), at the graben at which Mangala
Valles heads. Terrestrial volcanic channels of similar
morphology have been recognized [e.g., Carr and Greeley,
1980, p. 123]. THEMIS daytime infrared image I10378012

These ledges may be generally described as horseshoe-
shaped headcuts with scour-formed closed depressions at
the bases of each cataract alcove [Baker, 1978b]. The Dry
Falls cataract, one of the largest such features in the
Channeled Scabland, is 5.5 km across and 120 m high
[e.g., Bretz, 1923; Baker, 1978b]. Although confident iden-
tification of this class of landform at Mangala Valles is
difficult, inner channels that head at scarps oriented trans-
versely to directions of past channel flow are relatively
common features along much of the system’s length
(Figure 13) [see also Baker and Milton, 1974].
[21] Pre-flood tributaries to channels deeply excavated
from earlier stream valleys in the Channeled Scabland form
hanging valleys with floors up to hundreds of meters above
the floors of excavated channels [e.g., Baker, 1978b]. At
Mangala Valles, there are numerous examples of tributary
channels stranded above more deeply incised channels (e.g.,
THEMIS VIS image V10429001). Some of the most
prominent such examples include subchannel segments that
terminate abruptly at the peripheries of large residual land-
forms within the main channel system itself (e.g., Figure 7).
[22] At the Channeled Scabland, distinctive scour depres-
sions are found along the floors of numerous conduits, and
appear to have formed by the action of vortices around and
in the lee of bedrock projections and large boulders [e.g.,
Baker, 1978a, 1978b]. Channeled Scabland scour features
and associated protuberances together define a characteristic
butte-and-basin topography, with a total relief of about 30–
100 m; the dimensions of scours are as great as kilometers
in length and tens of meters in depth [Baker, 1978b]. The
pitted surfaces of some channel units of Mangala Valles
have been identified as having possibly formed through
scour by floodwaters [Sharp and Malin, 1975; Zimbelman
et al., 1992], and some areas of irregular topography at
Mangala Valles are candidate examples of butte-and-basin
topography [Baker and Milton, 1974].
[23] Erosional longitudinal grooves in the Channeled
Scabland, formed where individual basalt surfaces were
eroded by flood flows, are typically separated horizontally
by hundreds of meters, and average 5 m in depth and 50 m

in width [Baker, 1978a, 1978b; Patton and Baker, 1978]. In
the Cheney-Palouse region, the widest longitudinal groove
is slightly under 300 m wide, and the deepest grooves have
depths as great as 25 m [Patton and Baker, 1978]. Parallel
gullies and ridges are common along the channel floors of
Mangala Valles, defining lineations with lengths as great as
ten or more kilometers and typical widths of 50 to 300 m
(Figure 8) [e.g., Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Zimbelman et
al., 1992; Chapman and Tanaka, 1993; Ghatan et al., 2005].
[24] Depositional landforms at the Channeled Scabland
include longitudinal bars, eddy bars, and giant current
ripples. Longitudinal bars, depositional features with long
dimensions oriented parallel to flow direction and thick-
nesses of tens of meters, are found in relatively uniform
Channeled Scabland reaches that lack abrupt changes in
width [e.g., Bretz et al., 1956; Baker, 1978b]. Such bars,
which include pendant bars, are present in the Channeled
Scabland downstream from bedrock projections and other
flow obstacles. Scabland eddy bars, poorly sorted sediment
accumulations tens of meters thick and deposited in former
environments of high turbulence, block the mouths of
drainages entering the Cheny-Palouse scabland tract, and
are associated with slackwater deposits that extend further
up the tributary valleys [e.g., Bretz, 1925, 1928; Baker,
1978b; Benito and O’Connor, 2003]. Giant current ripples,
composed of parallel ridges and swales with relief of up to
15 m, are distributed in a number of scabland channels
[Bretz et al., 1956; Baker, 1973, 1978b].
[25] At Mangala Valles, identification of landforms clearly
formed through aggradation involving fluvial or diluvial
processes has not yet been made, although there are many
examples of channel features at the lee of obstacles to flow,
and that conceivably could be depositional landforms
(Figure 6) [see also, e.g., Milton, 1973; Tanaka and
Chapman, 1990; Zimbelman et al., 1992; Ghatan et al.,
2005]. Confident discrimination between erosional and
depositional landforms in these cases has been problematic
[e.g., Baker and Kochel, 1978a], and recent work suggests
that most or all of the streamlined forms at Mangala Valles
are erosional [Ghatan et al., 2005]; Burr [2005] has
identified candidate depositional landforms associated with
Athabasca Valles, a Martian channel system that heads at

Giant current ripples cannot yet be confidently identified at
Mangala Valles, in part because candidate alluvial ripples
cannot be clearly discriminated from aeolian landforms that
can have similar appearances and dimensions (although high-
resolution photoclinometry and other techniques have poten-
tial in this regard [e.g., Burr et al., 2004]).
4. Volcanic Processes as Alternative Mechanisms
of Channel Formation at Mangala Valles
[26] The aqueous-flood hypothesis for incision of the
Mangala Valles channel system has been considered com-
pelling on the basis of the strong and seemingly unique
correspondence between the landforms of this system and
those of terrestrial drainage systems such as the Channeled
Scabland. The aqueous-flood hypothesis can account for the
basic nature of the Mangala Valles system, and has as a
result been appropriately used as a foundation for recent
studies of the system. However, the conspicuously volca-
notectonic nature of the Mangala Valles system, and shared
morphological and contextual characteristics with large and
apparently volcanic channels of the Moon and Venus,
suggest that an alternative volcanic mechanism of formation
should be developed for Mangala Valles, for consideration
alongside the aqueous-flood mechanism.
[27] Formation of the Mangala Valles system was linked
to igneous and tectonic processes. The system heads at a
graben interpreted to have formed in association with
Tharsis-related dike emplacement [e.g., Tanaka and Chap-
man, 1990; Me`ge et al., 2003; Schultz et al., 2004] and
identified as a source of past effusive volcanic flows [e.g.,
Craddock and Greeley, 1994; Wilson and Head, 2002].
Landforms such as leveed subchannels (Figure 9; see also,
e.g., THEMIS VIS V03676002), ridged plains (Figure 10;
see also, e.g., THEMIS VIS V04425003), and segments of
inverted channel topography (Figure 12) suggest that Man-
gala Valles channels acted as conduits and, at numerous
locales along the channel system, depositional basins for
past volcanic flows [e.g., Tanaka and Chapman, 1990;
Chapman and Tanaka, 1993; Ghatan et al., 2005]. The
presence at Mangala Valles of platy basin fill (Figure 14)
and subchannels defined by collapse pits (Figure 15) further
strengthen inferences that the channel system acted as a
conduit for volcanic flows [e.g., see Greeley, 1971a, 1971b;
Keszthelyi et al., 2000, 2004].
[28] The fluid that formed the Mangala Valles system
must have incised its anastamosing channels (Figure 7) and
carved or otherwise formed features such as the elongate
landforms located in the lee of obstacles (Figure 6). The
natural fluid to consider for formation of such features, on

the basis of terrestrial analogs, is water. However, although
volcanic processes on the Earth are normally constructive in
nature, theoretical and field-based studies have indicated
that substantial amounts of incision and scour can result
from the flow of molten rock through the processes of
thermal and mechanical erosion (see discussion below). The
possibility of formation of Martian outflow channels by the
flow of lava has been suggested previously [Schonfeld,
1976, 1977, 1979; Cutts et al., 1978; Leverington, 2004;
see also Carr, 1974b] and this possibility is consistent with
the basic nature of large lunar and Venusian channels of
apparent volcanic origin.
[29] Sinuous lunar rilles, formed volcanically [e.g.,Greeley,
1971a, 1971b; Cruikshank and Wood, 1972; Hulme, 1973]
in the absence of water [Keil et al., 1970; Schmitt et al., 1970;
Papike et al., 1991], can have characteristics that match those
of parts of the Mangala Valles system, including inner
channels [e.g., El-Baz et al., 1972], channel levees [e.g., El-
Baz and Roosa, 1972; Hulme, 1974; Schaber, 1973; Schultz,
1976], channel terraces [e.g., Schultz, 1976; Leverington,
2004; see also El-Baz et al., 1972], typical gradients of less
than one degree [Strain and El-Baz, 1977], longitudinal
profiles intermittently characterized by reverse gradients
[e.g., Greeley, 1971a; Strain and El-Baz, 1977], and exposure
of channel floors as a result of partial or complete drainage of
late-stage lava pulses [e.g., Swann et al., 1972]. Rilles incised
up to hundreds of meters into upland barriers across swaths as
great as several kilometers exist on the Moon, with examples
of incision located, e.g., at Rimae Herigonius [Greeley and
Spudis, 1978; see also Young et al., 1973; Schultz, 1976;
Leverington, 2006] and Rimae Prinz [Carr, 1974b; Schultz,
1976; Strain and El-Baz, 1977; Zisk et al., 1977; see also
Masursky et al., 1978; Leverington, 2004]. Some lunar chan-
nels contain streamlined landforms that may be erosional
residuals [Leverington, 2004, Figure 7].
[30] Venusian channels [e.g., Baker et al., 1992; Komatsu
et al., 1992, 1993; Asimow and Wood, 1992; Chadwick and
Schaber, 1993; Gregg and Greeley, 1993; Komatsu and
Baker, 1994] can range from relatively simple sinuous
landforms that have few or no tributaries and that have
many of the basic characteristics of lunar sinuous rilles
[Baker et al., 1992, 1997; Head et al., 1992; Komatsu and
Baker, 1994] to complex channels with distinctly nonlunar
characteristics such as complexly anastamosing reaches that
define large streamlined ‘‘islands’’ [e.g., Baker et al., 1992].
Although alternative aqueous interpretations have been
proposed [e.g., Jones and Pickering, 2003], the channels
of Venus are generally believed to have formed by the flow
of lava [e.g., Baker et al., 1992, 1997]. Evidence against
aqueous origins includes the instability of liquid water
under present conditions [e.g., Kargel et al., 1993], the
absence of landforms suggestive of past precipitation and
surface runoff, the correlation between channels and volca-
nic or impact-related sources [e.g., Asimow and Wood,
1992; Baker et al., 1997], and the apparent dry nature of
the Venusian geological system [e.g., Donahue and Russell,
1997; Nimmo and McKenzie, 1998]. Geochemical data
collected at seven Venera and Vega landing sites imply
mafic compositions [e.g., Surkov, 1983; Surkov et al., 1987;
Kargel et al., 1993], but no such data are available for
Venusian channels; hypotheses for formation of channels by
lavas of ultramafic or other compositions have been pro-
posed to account for the apparent erosive properties of
involved fluids [e.g., Baker et al., 1992].
[31] Large and complex Venusian channels include a prom-
inent system located northeast of Ozza Mons (Figure 16)
[Komatsu et al., 1993] and Kallistos Vallis, a 1200-km-long
outflow channel at Astkhik Planum [e.g., Baker et al., 1992;
see also Leverington, 2004, Figure 14]. Systems such as these
share a wide range of characteristics with Mangala Valles,
including channels that appear to have been incised into
country rock, streamlined residual landforms, complexly
anastamosing reaches, channels of variable width, exposure
of channel floors through partial or complete drainage of late-
stage fluid flows, and channel lineations oriented along
directions of paleoflow. The highest-resolution Magellan
radar images have pixel dimensions of 100  100 m
(resampled to 75  75 m for the full-resolution radar
map, or FMAP, databases), rendering confident identification
of bedforms (e.g., longitudinal grooves) on this spatial scale
difficult. The coarseness of Magellan topographic databases
of Venus, with resampled Global Topographic Data Record
(GTDR) data characterized by pixel sizes of 5  5 km,
severely inhibits meaningful quantification of the relief of
channel bedforms and of channel depths. Magellan stereo-
image data sets offer potential for generation of topographic
databases of improved spatial resolution, but processing of
these data sets can be challenging [e.g., Howington-Krause et
al., 2006], and these data sets are not available for systems
such as Kallistos Vallis. Importantly, although the attributes
of numerous Venusian channels are suggestive of fluid
erosion [e.g., Baker et al., 1992; Komatsu et al., 1993;
Komatsu and Baker, 1994; Baker and Komatsu, 1999], the
lack of high-resolution topographic data for Venus currently
places limits on the confidence with which conclusions can
be made in this regard.
[32] A volcanic interpretation of the Mangala Valles
channel system is consistent with the basic properties and
formation mechanisms of large volcanic channels of the
inner solar system. This interpretation also appears to be
consistent with the nature of Mangala Valles landforms
previously interpreted as having formed through aqueous
processes. The lobate-margined and festooned flow deposits
proximal to the main source graben of Mangala Valles,
previously interpreted as glacier-like landforms produced
through phreatomagmatic processes and related outpourings
of groundwater [Wilson and Head, 2004; Head et al., 2004],
may alternatively be interpreted as ridged volcanic flows
erupted from within the graben structure or channeled
through the graben from Daedalia Planum. Such an inter-
pretation is supported by the presence of similarly ridged and
festooned volcanic flow units erupted from the same source
graben at the volcanic plains of adjacent Daedalia Planum
(Figure 17a), as well as at, e.g., the region east of the
northern mouths of Mangala Valles (Figure 17b) (a volcanic
interpretation is also consistent with the basic nature of
volcanic deposits located elsewhere on Mars, Moon, and
Earth [e.g., Mollard and Janes, 1984; Leverington and
Maxwell, 2004; Greeley et al., 2005]). A volcanic interpre-
tation is compatible with a wide range of climate conditions,
whereas the predicted instability of surficial and near-surface
water ice at latitudes within 30 of the equator [e.g.,
Farmer and Doms, 1979] does not favor the presence of
glaciers in this region.

[33] Surface exposure of the deposits of the terminal
basins of Mangala Valles is poor due to cover by materials
of the Medusae Fossae Formation [e.g., Scott and Tanaka,
1986; Bradley et al., 2002; Hynek et al., 2003], as well as by
dune fields and wind-scoured cover (e.g., MOC image
M0001747), but exposed units are discontinuously found
along the dichotomy boundary (Figure 18) as well as north
of the Medusae Fossae Formation [e.g., Scott and Tanaka,
1986]. Exposed terminal deposits characterized by quasi-
circular depressions and cuspate margins (Figure 18a and
Figure 18c (top)), and similar deposits found within some
channels of Mangala Valles (Figure 8), have previously
been interpreted as degrading water-ice-rich flood deposits
[Zimbelman et al., 1992; Levy and Head, 2005]. However,
deposits with comparable features have been emplaced at
volcanic plains located, e.g., at the source graben of the
Mangala Valles system at Daedalia Planum (Figure 19a),
within the Arsia Mons caldera (Figure 19c), and on the
eastern flanks of Pavonis Mons (Figure 19d). Furthermore,
parts of the same Mangala Valles terminal deposits have a
ridged and platy nature (e.g., Figure 18c (bottom)) that is
matched at nearby volcanic units of Daedalia Planum (e.g.,
Figure 19b). The pitted and cuspate-margined units near the
mouths of Mangala Valles channels are overlain in places by
ridged and lobate-margined flows derived from the east and
of likely volcanic nature (Figure 17b), but the partly buried
units do not show visible signs of thermal disturbance
related either to the heat of flows during emplacement or
to the upward shift in melting isotherm that might have been
associated with the thickening of surface cover over ice-rich
units. A volcanic origin for the cuspate and pitted deposits at
Mangala Valles is considered consistent with (1) character-
ization by surface textures matched at volcanic plains in the
region; (2) association of these materials with volcanic
flows in a range of environments far removed from outflow
channels; (3) a lack of response of materials to changes in
thermal conditions related to burial by volcanic flows; and
(4) the presence of these deposits at equatorial latitudes
where water ice is unstable [e.g., Farmer and Doms, 1979].
A volcanic origin for a substantial volume of materials
beyond the mouths of Mangala Valles is required of the
volcanic hypothesis, since although many large volcanic
channel systems on the Moon and Venus lack lava deltas at
their mouths, extensive volcanic deposits are always present
at the terminal basins of these systems [e.g., Leverington,
2004]. The characteristics of the units at the northern
mouths of the Mangala Valles system appear to be consis-
tent with this requirement, as is the ridged and lobate-
margined nature of units exposed north of the Medusae
Fossae Formation [e.g., Scott and Tanaka, 1986].
[34] Prominent inverted-channel features found in a seg-
ment of the northern Mangala Valles system (Figure 12)
have characteristics consistent with those expected of lava
flows [e.g., Chapman and Tanaka, 1993], but these resistant

materials need not have been emplaced in a channel system
carved by water. Many of the inverted features only partly
fill the main Mangala Valles reaches within which they are
nested (even accounting for subsequent erosional recession
of channel rims), implying that host materials of the flows
were channel-fill materials of relatively low resistance. The
surface elevations of inverted channel-fill deposits generally
match the elevations of corresponding rims of the main
Mangala Valles channels, suggesting that host materials
once filled the main channels here, rendering a diluvial
origin for these host materials unlikely. Accumulation of ash
or aeolian deposits would be consistent with the nature of
infilling of these channel reaches, and is consistent with the
once-greater sediment cover of the region implied by the
abundance of aeolian deposits and yardang fields found
across the region, extending south from the Medusae Fossae
Formation. Other inverted channels in the region (e.g.,
features at the nearby volcanic plains of Daedalia Planum,
V14859003, and a leveed channel in Noachian uplands
adjacent to Mangala Valles, V16594001) also imply possi-
ble formation during confinement by now-eroded host
materials of nonalluvial nature.
5. Eruption Volumes and Effusion Rates
[35] Observations of terrestrial lava flows suggest that the
surface flow of mafic molten rock is non-Newtonian and is
commonly laminar [e.g., Shaw et al., 1968; Shaw, 1969;
Hulme, 1973, 1974, 1982; Carr, 1974b; Hulme and Fielder,
Figure 18. Surface deposits at and beyond the mouths of Mangala Valles. Although deposits of the
terminal basin of the Mangala Valles system are extensively covered by the Medusae Fossae Formation
(MF) and by a variety of aeolian and wind-scoured surface materials, exposed units (e.g., a–e) have
characteristics consistent with volcanic plains such as those of nearby Daedalia Planum (DP) and the
Tharsis rise (e.g., Figure 19); some exposed materials (e.g., d and e) appear to have flowed from the distal
margins of western Arsia Mons and the Tharsis rise, a region that includes Daedalia Planum. Exposed
units north of the Medusae Fossae Formation (north of the region depicted above) also have ridged and
lobate-margined characteristics consistent with those expected of volcanic flows [e.g., Scott and Tanaka,
1986], but in this region are likely substantially derived from Olympus Mons. MOC images:

1977; Wilson et al., 1982; Pinkerton and Wilson, 1994],
although valid generalizations across planets and environ-
mental conditions are elusive. For example, the yield
strengths of lunar mare lavas may have been up to 100
times less than those of terrestrial basalts [Hulme, 1982],
and high Reynolds numbers and associated turbulent be-
havior are expected to have characterized many large lunar
and Martian basaltic flows erupted with low viscosities and
very high effusion rates over mainly low topographic slopes
[e.g., Hulme, 1973, 1982; Pinkerton et al., 1975; Hulme and
Fielder, 1977; Wilson et al., 1982; Keszthelyi et al., 2006;
see also Howard et al., 1972]. Despite a lack of full
understanding of the nature of volcanic flow, theoretical
and terrestrial field-based studies have indicated that sub-
stantial amounts of erosion can result from the flow of
molten rock, with erosion by flowing lava likely taking
place through the combined action of (1) thermal processes
involving the melting of substrate materials by the heat of
lava and (2) mechanical processes involving the physical
removal of substrate materials by flowing lava [e.g., Hulme,
1973, 1982; Peterson and Swanson, 1974; Cutts et al., 1978;
Barnes and Barnes, 1990; Greeley et al., 1998; Kauahikaua
et al., 1998; Kerr, 2001; Wilson and Mouginis-Mark, 2001;
Williams et al., 2004, 2005; Ferlito and Siewert, 2006]. As
lava flows through a channel, heat is transferred through
conduction and lava convection to the cooler underlying
ground, and heat is also lost from the flow surface through
convection and radiation [e.g., Hulme and Fielder, 1977;
Flynn and Mouginis-Mark, 1994; Greeley et al., 1998;
Harris and Rowland, 2001]. The loss of energy from the
flow surface can result in formation of a fixed or free-floating
insulating flow cover that can help maintain high lava
temperatures over distances of hundreds or thousands of
kilometers [e.g., Greeley, 1971a; Pinkerton et al., 1975;
Wilhelms, 1987; Peterson et al., 1994; Sakimoto and Zuber,
1998], such that 20–30 m thick flows on Mars may be
expected to cool by only 50–150 K after flow of 1500 km
[Keszthelyi et al., 2006]. In thermal erosion, the channel
substrate is heated until its temperature reaches its melting
point, after which the substrate progressively undergoes
phase change at constant temperature as latent heat is
absorbed [e.g., Hulme, 1973, 1982; Hulme and Fielder,
1977; Kerr, 2001]. The temperature of liquids formed by
phase change of substrate materials can be raised beyond
melting temperatures through absorption of additional energy.
[36] Although erosion of an unconsolidated substrate
might be accomplished by flowing lava without substantial
phase change, erosion of solid bedrock could necessitate
partial melting of up to 40% by weight [e.g., Hulme,
1973; see also, e.g., Greeley et al., 1998]. Field observations
suggest that even small volcanic flows are capable of
substantial erosion. For example, incision at an average rate
of 10 cm per day over a period of two months has been
measured at a small Hawaiian lava tube that developed near
Pu’u ’O’o; this channel had width of only 4 m, a flow
velocity of 2.5 m/s, lava temperature of 1425 K, and low
Reynolds numbers of 16–64 that are indicative of laminar
flow [Kauahikaua et al., 1998]. The capacity of lava for
erosion of channel substrates is expected to be further
enhanced by the presence of turbulent flow conditions
[e.g., Hulme, 1973, 1982; Carr, 1974b; Pinkerton et al.,
1975; Hulme and Fielder, 1977; Bussey et al., 1995;
Greeley et al., 1998], the flow of lava over topographic
irregularities that favor formation of lava falls [e.g.,
Kauahikaua et al., 1998; Kerr, 2001; Williams et al.,
2004], the action of mechanical abrasion by lava and
block fragments [e.g., Kauahikaua et al., 1998, 2002;
Fagents and Greeley, 2001; Williams et al., 2004; Ferlito
and Siewert, 2006], and heightened lava temperatures
[e.g., Bussey et al., 1995]. Some of these factors are
interrelated; for example, higher lava temperatures gener-
ally result in lower viscosities [e.g., Yan et al., 2001]
which in turn can allow for greater flow turbulence [e.g.,
Hulme, 1982].
[37] Aspects of the nature of the flow of lava are yet to be
fully described in a quantitative manner [e.g., Mouginis-
Mark et al., 1992; Fagents and Greeley, 2001] and a
comprehensive theory of both thermal and mechanical
erosion by lava has not yet emerged. The viability of
volcanic mechanisms for formation of the Mangala Valles
system is therefore, at present, best illustrated by the
existence and geomorphological characteristics of large

lunar and Venusian channels interpreted as volcanic [e.g.,
Greeley, 1971a, 1971b; Swann et al., 1972; Carr, 1974b;
Strain and El-Baz, 1977; Wilhelms, 1987; Komatsu and
Baker, 1994; Baker et al., 1992, 1997; Komatsu et al.,
1993]. However, a crude estimate of the volume of lava that
might have been involved in the hypothesized volcanic
formation of Mangala Valles can be calculated on the basis
of the minimum volume of material removed during chan-
nel formation. The main Mangala Valles system (Figure 20)
has a total surface area of 43,000 km2. The form of the
channel system is complex, with typical channel depths
ranging from 100 to as much as 700 m (Figure 20).
Assuming a representative channel depth of 200 m (a depth
of 100 m is assumed by Tanaka and Chapman [1990]), the
minimum volume of material removed from the main
Mangala Valles system is estimated to be about 8600 km3,
a volume that is larger than the 3000 km3 estimate of
Tanaka and Chapman [1990] and the 5700 km3 estimate
implied by Hanna and Phillips [2006], but smaller than the
13,000–20,000 km3 estimate of Ghatan et al. [2005]
(which also considers a region east of the main channels
of Mangala Valles; see Figure 20). A volume greater than
this 8600 km3 estimate could have been removed under the
volcanic hypothesis for formation of Mangala Valles, on the
basis of the tendency of lava to emplace solid fill materials
within channel subbasins toward the terminations of individ-
ual eruption events, thus potentially leading to the removal of
this additional material during subsequent flow events.
[38] For the purposes of order-of-magnitude estimations,
the initial temperature of a magma of basaltic composition
can be taken as 1450 K [e.g., Kauahikaua et al., 1998;
Burgi et al., 2002] (although higher temperatures are
possible), and initial cold-surface temperatures of Martian
terrain can be taken as 220 K [e.g., Carr, 1996]. Substantial
changes to the rheological properties of basaltic lava can
take place at temperatures below 1400 K [e.g., Keszthelyi
and Self, 1998], and thus the bulk temperature of basalt
involved in hypothesized volcanic flows is not likely to
have dropped substantially below this temperature during
the main phases of hypothesized channel incision. Making
the simplifying assumption that the densities and specific
heat capacities of the solid and liquid phases of basalt are
equal, the ratio of the mass of cold regolith to the mass of
lava that would allow lava temperatures to be maintained at

along selected cross-channel transects are given (A to G). Extensive raised volcanic plains that appear to
have formed in association with Mangala Valles are outlined by a dotted curve [see also Ghatan et al.,
2005] but are not treated here as part of the main erosional channel system. The surface area of the main
Mangala Valles system is 43,000 km2. Typical channel depths within this system range from 100 to as
much as 700 m.

1400 K can be estimated on the basis of conservation of
energy to be 0.04. Assuming a minimum volume of
removed material to be 8600 km3, this figure implies a
minimum total channel-forming lava volume of 2 
105 km3. This volume estimate accounts for that amount
of lava required to raise regolith to and above melting
temperatures exclusively through thermal mechanisms,
and does not take into account the energy required for
phase change of heated surface materials. Assuming a
density of basalt of 3000 kg/m3 [e.g., Hulme, 1973, 1982]
and a latent heat of fusion for basalt of 3.3  105 J/kg
[Yoder, 1976], an additional 8.5  1021 J would be
required to melt the full 8600 km3 of basalt bedrock at
the melting temperature of 1275 K. Assuming a total
erupted lava volume of 2  105 km3 and a specific heat of
mafic lava of 1200 J/kg K, this value represents an addi-
tional drop in melt temperature of 11.8 K and thus, as
expected [e.g., Hulme, 1982], is a relatively minor influence
on the simplified scenario given above. The loss of energy
associated with this drop in temperature is ultimately
returned to the system as these melted materials re-crystal-
lize, and the crystallization of an additional 2  105 km3 of
erupted basalt results in the release of an additional 2 
1023 J (energy sufficient to raise the temperature of this
volume by 280 K). The large influx of energy resulting
from crystallization of erupted lava is only partly offset
by expected cooling along the channel system (cooling of
0.1 K/km [Keszthelyi et al., 2006] results in cooling of
100 K along a 1000 km system) and by expected cooling at
flow fronts and the source vent (amounting to an approx-
imate total of tens of K [e.g., Keszthelyi et al., 2006]). Note
that the bulk density of removed regolith is unlikely to have
been equal to that of nonvesicular basalt (vesicular or
particulate basalt can have much lower densities that can
approach 1500 kg/m3) [e.g., Yan et al., 2001], and it is
likely that less than 40% of consolidated regolith would
have needed to have undergone a phase change for channel
erosion to have taken place [e.g., Hulme, 1973], and thus the
energy required to warm and melt regolith is likely over-
estimated above for the volume estimate of 8600 km3.
[39] The timing of an event of total volume 2  105 km3
is extremely difficult to meaningfully estimate. Assuming
an incision rate of 4  106 m/s (previously estimated for a
smaller lunar channel located in the Marius Hills [see
Hulme, 1973]), a total event time of 580 days is predicted,
implying an average eruption rate of 4  106 m3/s (a total
event time of 2000 days is predicted if a rate of incision of
1.16  106 m/s, measured at the small Hawaiian channel
discussed above [Kauahikaua et al., 1998], is used). Adding
to the substantial uncertainties involved in these estimates is
the lack of consideration of such factors as (1) the action of
mechanical processes of erosion [e.g., Kauahikaua et al.,
1998, 2002; Ferlito and Siewert, 2006] and (2) the influence
of expected high levels of flow turbulence [e.g., Howard et
al., 1972] on thermal erosion.
[40] The above estimates suggest a total volume of
erupted lava of 2  105 km3, an average eruption rate of
4  106 m3/s, and a combined event duration of 580 days.
These values are crudely derived minimums that could
conceivably underestimate the nature of hypothesized vol-
canic events by multiple orders of magnitude (though these
values may also overestimate aspects of volcanic events,
should, e.g., erupted magma temperatures have been nota-
bly greater than 1450 K, or should processes of mechanical
erosion have been significant). Formation of the Mangala
Valles system by graben-fed flows, or by Daedalia Planum
flows channeled through a segment of the source graben,
might be speculated to have taken place in concert with the
latter stages of formation of Arsia Mons. Such a scenario
could have involved episodic development of the system
over geologically extended periods of time that are not
reflected in the duration estimate.
[41] Though enormous relative to the volumes of large
historical terrestrial volcanic eruptions (a volume of
15 km3 was erupted during the 1783–1784 fissure erup-
tion at Laki, Iceland [Thordarson and Self, 1993]), the
estimated Mangala Valles eruption volume of 2  105 km3
roughly corresponds to the total volume of 1.7  105 km3 of
the terrestrial Columbia River Basalt Group [Tolan et al.,
1989]; the largest individual flows of the Columbia Plateau
flood basalts had volumes that in some cases exceeded
1000 km3 [Reidel, 1998]. An estimated eruption volume at
Mangala Valles of 2  105 km3 is equivalent to 3–8% of
the total estimated volume of lunar mare basalts if average
mare thicknesses are taken to be between 1.0 and 0.4 km,
respectively [DeHon, 1974; Wilhelms, 1984], and represents
13% of the volume of the main Arsia Mons edifice onMars
[Smith et al., 2001]. The terminal basins of the Mangala
Valles system extend from Lucus Planum northward to
Amazonis Plantitia and Arcadia Planitia. Exposed units in
these regions have characteristics consistent with volcanic
origins (see discussion above), and flow of 2  105 km3 of
lava into this broad region would result in total deposit
thicknesses averaging 50 to 400 m for surface areas of 4 
106 to 5  105 km2, respectively.
[42] The source of Mangala Valles is a component of
the Tharsis-radial graben system interpreted as having
formed in response to plume-related dike intrusion, with
individual dikes predicted to have widths of 0.4 km,
heights of 100 km, and lengths of up to 3000 km
[Wilson and Head, 2002]. A dike with these dimensions
will have a volume of 1.2  105 km3, which is of the
same order of magnitude as the magma volume estimated
above; the graben at the head of the Mangala Valles
system is 1500 km long, corresponding to an estimated
dike volume of 6  104 km3.
[43] The estimated effusion rate of 4  106 m3/s is far
greater than the tens of cubic meters per second typical of
modern terrestrial eruptions involving a wide range of lava
compositions [e.g., Hon et al., 1994; Calvari et al., 2002;
Kauahikaua et al., 2002], as well as the rates of less than
400 m3/s estimated for large historical eruptions at the
Hawaiian Islands [e.g., Rowland and Walker, 1990]. A
maximum effusion rate of 8.7  103 m3/s has been
estimated for the Laki fissure eruption of 1783–1784
[Thordarson and Self, 1993]. However, the geological
record suggests that past high-effusion volcanic events have
taken place on the Earth, with eruption rates of 1  104 to
1  106 m3/s regarded as possible for individual flows of
the Columbia River Basalt Group [Reidel, 1998]. The
largest known effusive eruption of modern times appears
to have occurred on Jupiter’s moon, Io, at Pillan Patera,
where peak effusion rates associated with the 1997 eruption
of 31 km3 of lava over a 100-day period are estimated to

E11005
have exceeded 1  104 m3/s [e.g., Davies et al., 2006].
Extreme rates of lava effusion have been cited as necessary
to account for the sizes of large basalt flows on the Moon,
with a rate of 1.3 106 m3/s estimated for emplacement of a
single 400-km-long flow erupted from a fissure vent at Mare
Imbrium [Schaber, 1973; Schaber et al., 1976]. Extrapola-
tion of terrestrial and lunar effusion estimates suggests that
rates up to and perhaps in excess of 1  106 m3/s should be
associated with formation of flows with lengths of many
hundreds of kilometers [Walker, 1973; Schaber et al., 1976].
Consistent with this perspective, rates of effusion equal to or
exceeding 1 106 m3/s have been estimated for someMartian
lava flows [Baloga and Pieri, 1986; Cattermole, 1987;
Keszthelyi et al., 2006] and rates of up to 1  108 m3/s
have been estimated for large individual volcanic flows on
both the Moon and Mars [Zimbelman, 1998]. Rates of lava
discharge of between 1  105 and 1  106 m3/s have been
estimated for large flow fields on Venus [e.g., Lancaster et al.,
1995], and a rate of up to 5  107 m3/s has been estimated
for formation of Venusian outflow channel Kallistos Vallis
[Baker et al., 1997].
6. Discussion
[44] Formation of the Mangala Valles system by cata-
strophic aqueous floods is consistent with similarities in the
nature of landforms of this system and those of systems
including the Channeled Scabland. However, a volcanic
interpretation of the Mangala Valles system represents a
viable (but unproven) alternative hypothesis on the basis of
(1) the location of the head of the system at a large structural
feature known to have acted as a source for effusive
volcanic eruptions; (2) the distribution of landforms with
volcanic affinities along and beyond the Mangala Valles
system, suggesting past conveyance and pooling of large
volcanic flows by the system; and (3) the potential for lunar
and Venusian landforms to act as both morphological and
process-based analogs for formation and evolution of the
system. Indeed, the large lunar and Venusian channels
developed through voluminous discharge from the subsur-
face, and, on this basis alone, might be argued to be more
complete analogs to Mangala Valles than terrestrial systems
formed in association with ice-dammed lakes. Rudimentary
estimates of lava volume and effusion rates associated with
hypothesized mechanisms of formation of Mangala Valles
are consistent with those made previously for large volcanic
landforms of the solar system.
[45] The volcanic hypothesis for formation of the Man-
gala Valles channel system is not encumbered by present or
past instability of liquid water at the surface of Mars,
whereas this issue has the potential to limit the viability
of some aqueous scenarios [e.g., see Carr, 1996; Hoffman,
2000]. For example, the mechanism of near-surface dike
emplacement for release of water from a cryosphere-con-
fined aquifer could require periods of water release that are
on the order of several million years [McKenzie and Nimmo,
1999], lengths of time that are not consistent with stability
considerations for low latitudes [e.g., Farmer and Doms,
1979; Rossbacher and Judson, 1981; Clifford and Hillel,
1983], nor with the absence of large basins that could have
acted as long-term surface reservoirs for later catastrophic
floods. Uncertainty remains regarding the manner in which
vast aquifers could have accumulated in the southern high-
lands of Mars, perched several kilometers above the floor of
the northern lowlands in highly permeable and regionally
interconnected regolith units [see, e.g., Clifford and Parker,
2001]. Deliberation also continues regarding the capacity of
such aquifers to have catastrophically supplied massive
volumes of water to the surface at rates required for aqueous
outflow-channel formation [e.g., Head et al., 2003; Manga,
2004].
[46] The aqueous and volcanic hypotheses each represent
end-members of a spectrum of possible processes that could
have played key roles in the development of Mangala
Valles, with the aqueous hypothesis involving simple vol-
canic resurfacing of a channel system otherwise formed
primarily by catastrophic aqueous flows, and with the
volcanic hypothesis involving channel formation by lava
flow. A hybrid hypothesis would involve formation of the
Mangala Valles channels through incision by aqueous
flows, followed by or in concert with substantial modifica-
tion of the system through erosion by volcanic flows. Other
processes (e.g., glacial or CO2-related) cannot be dismissed
out of hand, either as end-member hypotheses or as pro-
cesses of secondary importance in channel evolution. Cer-
tainly, aeolian and mass-wasting processes have greatly
influenced the landscape of the Mangala Valles region since
the time of channel formation.
[47] A volcanic interpretation of Mangala Valles relies
upon assumptions that (1) present volcanic interpretations
of large lunar and Venusian channels are correct and (2)
similarities in the characteristics of Martian, lunar, and
Venusian channels reflect similarities regarding processes
of formation. It is possible that neither assumption is valid.
Progress regarding assessment of the end-member volcanic
hypothesis should follow both from continued investigation
of Mangala Valles and from further numerical modeling of
large volcanic channel systems; aspects of such modeling
efforts would be facilitated by acquisition of high-resolution
topographic data sets for the Moon and Venus. Importantly,
the end-member volcanic hypothesis discussed in this paper
is testable. For example, identification of an aggradational
origin (involving alluvial or diluvial processes) for large
streamlined islands of the system would validate these
features as true braid bars rather than simple erosional
residuals, and would negate the end-member volcanic
hypothesis for formation of Mangala Valles.
7. Conclusions
[48] Similarities in the nature of the channel landforms of
Mangala Valles and those of aqueous flood systems have
suggested possible commonalities in mechanisms of chan-
nel formation. However, a volcanic origin for the Mangala
Valles system also appears viable on the basis of the
following factors: (1) the system heads at a structural feature
that acted as a source of past effusive volcanic eruptions;
(2) the nature of surface materials at Mangala Valles is
suggestive of past flow of large volumes of lava through the
channel system to its terminal basins; and (3) large lunar
and Venusian channel systems have the potential to act as
both morphological and process-based analogs for forma-
tion and evolution of the system. Crude estimates suggest
that formation of the channel system through thermal mech-

anisms of lava incision could have taken place through
eruption of 2  105 km3 of lava, a volume that under
some conditions would involve an average eruption rate of
4 106 m3/s over a total event duration of almost 600 days
(though likely taking place through multiple events over
geological timescales). A smaller volume of lava would be
required if mechanical processes of erosion were also
substantially involved. The volcanic hypothesis for forma-
tion of Mangala Valles, and a hybrid hypothesis involving
formation of Mangala Valles through aqueous processes
followed by or in concert with substantial modification of
the system by volcanic erosion and deposition, appears
worthy of future consideration.
