Abstract
In the mouse genome, we found one processed Itpa gene-like sequence and two processed Itpa pseudogenes
as well as the Itpa gene itself with introns, located on chromosome 2F3, which was isolated by a retro-
recombination method. We also identiﬁed three types (A, B, C) of Itpa transcripts in mouse tissues. The
processed Itpa gene-like sequence located on chromosome 2E1 has a complete open reading frame for exactly
the same polypeptide as ITPA encoded by the type A transcript, with a polyadenylation signal. However,
no transcribed sequence derived from the Itpa gene-like sequence was detectable in any of the mouse tissues
examined, thus naming the sequence as Itpa processed pseudogene α. The type A Itpa mRNA, which was
expressed in all mouse tissues examined, only encodes mouse ITPA polypeptide consisting of 198 amino acid
residues with a capacity to hydrolyze dITP into dIMP. Itpa mRNA was detected in all tissues examined,
and its expression is especially high in the testis, brain, and thymus. ITPA protein was mostly detected
in the cytoplasm, to a lesser extent in the nuclei of neurons in the brain, and also those of hepatocytes,
epithelial cells lining the bile duct, and endothelial cells lining the portal vein in the liver.
Key words: ITPase; ITP; XTP; pseudogene; retro-recombination; oxidative deamination
1. Introduction
The accumulation of modiﬁed or damaged bases in ge-
nomic DNA is a major cause of altered genetic informa-
tion that results in mutagenesis or even programmed cell
death.1 It has been established that such damaged bases
in genomic DNA arise from two independent pathways:
one is a consequence of the direct modiﬁcation of the
normal bases in the DNA and the other is incorporation
of modiﬁed nucleotides generated in resident nucleotide
pools.2,3
The incorporation of dUTP into DNA which arises
from the deamination of dCTP or as a byproduct of UTP
biosynthesis is a major cause for shortening the Okazaki
fragment during nascent strand synthesis that occurs
during base excision repair by uracil DNA glycosylase.4
dUTP is thus detrimental to organisms and it is elim-
inated by a speciﬁc nucleotidase, dUTPase, from the

resident nucleotide pools.5–7 8-Oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine
triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) is one of the major causes of
spontaneous mutagenesis, because 8-oxo-dGTP is formed
by the spontaneous oxidation of dGTP in the nucleotide
pool and it is incorporated into the nascent strand op-
posite both adenine and cytosine in the template strand
during DNA replication.8 We have demonstrated that 8-
oxo-dGTP is speciﬁcally hydrolyzed by MutT family pro-
teins from prokaryotes to humans, and, as a result, organ-
isms maintained a low spontaneous mutation rate.9–12
Genome projects revealed the existence of many MutT-
like proteins with diﬀerent substrate speciﬁcities,13–17
and a structure-based approach recently identiﬁed an-
other novel enzyme, namely inosine triphosphate py-
rophosphatase (ITPase), which hydrolyzes deaminated
purine nucleoside triphosphates such as ITP, dITP, and
XTP.18–20 In Escherichia coli, a mutant of the rdgB gene
coding ITPase protein is viable but it shows synthetic
lethality with recA or recBC mutation.21 Recently, the
lethality of rdgB recA or rdgB recBC double mutants
has been shown to be suppressed by the inactivation of
endonuclease V (EndoV) which initiates the excision of

deoxyinosine (dI) or deoxyxanthosine (dX) incorporated
into DNA.22 It is likely that an ITPase deﬁciency results
in the accumulation of its substrate nucleotides, dITP or
dXTP in the nucleotide pools, thus causing an increased
accumulation of dI or dX into DNA, and further excision
repair initiated by EndoV leads to chromosomal fragmen-
tation in recA or recBC mutants. Following this study,22
the missense mutants of the dut gene encoding dUTPase,
were reported to exhibit synthetic lethality with recA or
recBC mutations, and synthetic lethality was suppressed
by inactivation of the ung gene encoding uracil DNA gly-
cosylase, thus conﬁrming that the accumulation of abnor-
mal nucleotides in the nucleotide pools increased chro-
mosomal fragmentation as a consequence of the excision
repair of such abnormal bases incorporated into DNA.7
The ﬁrst reported deﬁciency in the ITPase in a human
was characterized by an elevated ITP level in erythro-
cytes as an inherited abnormality.23 However, such in-
dividuals do not exhibit any abnormal phenotype even
with accumulation of ITP in erythrocytes. A cDNA
for human ITPase was isolated and its gene ITPA was
identiﬁed,19 and the structure of the hITPA gene and nu-
cleotide alterations responsible for the ITPase deﬁciency
were reported.24,25
In contrast to E. coli, the biological importance of IT-
Pase protein and the pathological consequences of its de-
ﬁciency in humans or mammals have not yet been eluci-
dated. To explore the biological signiﬁcance of ITPase in
mammals, disruption of the mouse Itpa gene and char-
acterization of such mutant mice is considered to be one
of the best experimental approaches. During isolation
of the Itpa gene from the mouse genome, we found one
processed Itpa gene-like sequence and two processed Itpa
pseudogenes as well as the Itpa gene itself with introns,
which was isolated by a retro-recombination method in
the present study.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. RT-PCR
Total RNAs from CCE mouse embryonic stem (ES)
cells derived from 129SvEv mouse,26 serum-starved and
serum-stimulated BALB/c3T3 cells,27,28 and C57BL/6J
adult mouse tissue specimens were prepared using
ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Total RNAs from BALB/c mouse
tissues were purchased from Clontech. Total RNA
(10 µg) was treated with 20 units of RNase-free deoxyri-
bonuclease I (DNase I) (Amersham Biosciences) at 37◦C
for 15 min in 100 µl of reaction buﬀer containing 40 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 6 mM MgCl2. The treated RNA
was puriﬁed by extraction with Phenol/CHCl3 (1 : 1)
followed by ethanol precipitation. The puriﬁed RNA
(2 µg) was used for synthesis of the ﬁrst strand cDNA
using a First-strand cDNA synthesis Kit (Amersham

Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. PCR was performed in 20-µl reaction mixture con-
taining 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.3 µl of the ﬁrst-strand cDNA, 0.4 U of recombi-
nant Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), 4 µM of each primer
(Table 1), and 200 µM of each deoxynucleoside triphos-
phate. The initial denaturation was performed at 95◦C
for 1 min and the ampliﬁcation was performed by 27, 32,
40 cycles of denaturation at 95◦C for 30 sec, annealing
at 55◦C for 20 sec, and extension at 72◦C for 60 sec,
followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72◦C for 5 min. PCR
products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis,
and the band intensity on the gel stained with ethidium
bromide was measured using the LAS1000-plus Lumines-
cent Image Analysis System (FUJI FILM).
2.2. Genomic PCR
Genomic DNA (25 µg) from CCE cells was treated
with RNase A (20 units, Sigma), which was boiled for
15 min to inactivate contaminated DNase, in 150 µl of a
reaction mixture containing 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and

0.5 mM EDTA at 37◦C for 30 min to eliminate the resid-
ual RNA completely. DNA was puriﬁed by extraction
with Phenol/CHCl3 followed by ethanol precipitation. A
PCR reaction was performed with 100 ng of the puriﬁed
genomic DNA with appropriate primers (Table 1), as de-
scribed in the RT-PCR section. The PCR products were
subcloned into pT7 Blue T vector (Novagen) plasmid and
their nucleotide sequences were conﬁrmed by sequencing
the insert from the both strands using ABI Sequencing
Kits and a model 3100 automated DNA sequencer (ABI),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.3. Isolation of genomic clones for Itpa gene
A PCR fragment carrying intron 2 or 3 of Itpa am-
pliﬁed from CCE genomic DNA was subcloned into the
multi-cloning site of the πANγ plasmid, and each plasmid
was introduced into E. coli MC1061[P3] cells.29 Each cell
was infected with λ phage genomic library constructed in
λTK phage with 129 SvJ mouse genomic DNA.29 Four
out of 6 clones isolated with a probe plasmid carrying
intron 2, and 8 out of 14 clones isolated with a probe
plasmid carrying intron 3, using the retro-recombination
methods,29 contained the appropriate probe sequence
and identical adjacent sequences for each other, respec-
tively.
2.4. Plasmid construction
Mouse Itpa cDNA was ampliﬁed from the mouse testis
library (ML 4007AB, Clontech) and from total RNA
prepared from CCE cells using 5-3 mIT and 3-3 mIT
primers (Table 1). Human ITPA cDNA was ampliﬁed
from a human leukocyte library (HL 4021AB, Clontech)
using 5-3 hIT and 3-2 hIT primers (Table 1). PCR
products were subcloned into pT7 Blue T Vector. The
entire coding region of type A Itpa cDNA (615 bp)
was ampliﬁed with 5-1 mIT and 3-1 mIT primers, in
which a Nco I site at the initiation site and an EcoRV
site after the termination codon was introduced, respec-
tively. The PCR product digested with Nco I and EcoRV
was subcloned into a Nco I/BamHI site of the pET8c
and pET32a plasmids (Novagen), in which a BamHI
site was converted to a blunt end by ﬁlling in with
Klenow fragment. Obtained plasmids were designated
pET8c:mITPA and pET32a:mITPA, respectively. A Nco
I-BamHI fragment of hITPA cDNA was also subcloned
into a Nco I/BamHI site of pET32a or pET8c plasmid
yielding pET32a:hITPA and pET8c:hITPA, respectively.
2.5. Immunodetection of ITPA
Rabbit antiserum against the fusion protein Trx-
hITPA were prepared as described previously.30 The an-
tiserum was able to detect both Trx-hITPA and mITPA
proteins with almost the same eﬃciency, and thus was
designated as anti-ITPA. Western blotting analyses were
performed as previously described,31 using anti-ITPA
serum (1/500 dilution). Immunohistochemistry with
anti-ITPA were performed as follows. The mice were
deeply anesthetized with 5% pentobarbital, and perfused
transcardially with 10 ml of heparinized saline (0.9%)
followed by 30 ml of phosphate buﬀer (0.1 M) con-
taining 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue specimens were
ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4◦C for 12 to 24 hr
and embedded in paraﬃn. The sections (4 µm) were
deparaﬃnized, pretreated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in
methanol, and subjected to immunohistochemistry with
anti-ITPA serum (1/500 dilution). The sections were
processed by Vectastain ABC KITs (Vector Laborato-
ries) with an anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary anti-
body, and the peroxidase reaction product was detected
using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (Sigma).
The slides were subjected to counterstaining by hema-
toxylin. Digital images were acquired using Axioskop2
plus equipped with an AxioCam (Carl Zeiss).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Isolation of Mouse cDNA and Genomic Sequences
Homologous to Human ITPA cDNA sequence
We searched the DNA sequence databases to retrieve
the mouse cDNA or genome sequences homologous to
human ITPA cDNA sequence (accession no. AF219116),
using the BLASTN program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/BLAST/), and found many mouse expressed se-
quence tags (ESTs) and several mouse genomic se-
quences. Among the many EST sequences retrieved,
the longest cDNA sequence (accession no. AK008279)
which encodes a polypeptide highly homologous to the
amino acid sequence of human ITPA protein (hITPA)
was selected, and it was used for the BLASTN search
with the Ensembl Genome Data Resources for mouse
(http://www.ensembl.org/Mus musculus/). The align-
ment revealed that there are several diﬀerent mouse chro-
mosomes carrying highly homologous but not identical
sequences to that of AK008279 itself, thus suggesting
that there are multiple genes for mouse ITPA protein
(mITPA) or related proteins.
To isolate cDNA or genomic sequences which encode
mITPA, we ampliﬁed the sequences from genomic DNA
and cDNA prepared from a mouse ES cell line CCE cells
which was established from a 129 SvEv mouse, using
two diﬀerent primer sets for the AK008279 EST sequence
(Fig. 1A, Table 1). From the RNase A-treated genomic
DNA, a major single fragment approximately 1100 bp in
length was ampliﬁed with primer set I (5-1 mIT and 3-
3 mIT), but not with primer set II (5-3 mIT and 3-3 mIT;
Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 7). In primer set I, the 5′-primer hy-
bridizes a region including the initiation codon while the
5′ primer in the latter set hybridizes its 5′-untranslated
region (UTR). In contrast, two major fragments of ap-
proximately 1100 and 830 bp in length from primer set I,

(I and II) were designed based on a mouse Itpa cDNA (acces-
sion no. AK008279). Primer set I with primers 5-1 mIT and
3-3 mIT, in which the 5′-primer hybridizes into the initiation
codon with 9-base extra sequence (see Table 1), was expected
to amplify the 1111-bp fragment, while primer set II with
primers 5-3 mIT and 3-3 mIT, in which the 5′-primer hybridizes
into 5′-UTR sequence, was expected to amplify the 1143-bp
fragment from Itpa cDNA. The coding regions for ITPA and
poly(A) sequences are shown with an open box and a wavy
line, respectively. B. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR
products. To avoid cross-contamination of genomic DNA or

DNase I before cDNA synthesis. PCR was performed with a

or 1140 and 860 bp in length from primer set II were am-
pliﬁed from the cDNA prepared from the DNase I-treated
RNA, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 8).
A sequence analysis of subcloned PCR products (102
independent clones) obtained by primer set II, revealed
three diﬀerent types of cDNA sequences (types A, B, and
C) to be ampliﬁed from the RNA prepared from the ES
cells (Fig. 2A). In the RT-PCR products, the ratio of each
cDNA identiﬁed was type A : B : C = 1 : 0.3 : 0.05. The
longest type A cDNA isolated was 1143 bp length with
an open reading frame (ORF) of 597 nucleotides, whose
sequence was identical to AK008279 and was predicted
to encode a polypeptide of 198 amino acid residues with a
molecular weight of 21,883 Da. The amino acid sequence
was 89.9% identical to that of human ITPA (194 aa).
Type B and C cDNAs were 864 and 720 bp length, re-
spectively, and had the same 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences as
did the type A cDNA. Both of the cDNAs had the same
reading frame as that of the type A, but they were shorter
than that of type A, and were 318 and 168 nucleotides
in length, respectively. Both type B and C cDNA shared
the ﬁrst ATG codon and the stop codon (TAG) with type
A cDNA, and were predicted to encode polypeptides with
105 or 55 amino acid residues missing central parts (94–
186 aa or 44–186 aa) of the full-length mITPA protein,
respectively (Fig. 2A). These results were conﬁrmed by a
sequence analysis of RT-PCR products (100 clones) ob-
tained by primer set I, whose length was 1111, 832, or
688 bp, respectively (data not shown).
A sequence analysis of 50 clones of DNA fragments
ampliﬁed from genomic DNA with primer set I revealed
a single 1108-bp fragment whose sequence was 99% iden-
tical to that of the type A Itpa cDNA (Fig. 2B). The
more 5′- and 3′-regions of the genomic sequence were
ampliﬁed using a new primer set based on the mouse
DNA sequence from clone RP23-16O15 on chromosome 2
(accession no. AL672251) which contained exactly the
same sequence shown in Fig. 2B (Table 1). The genomic
sequence (1135 bp) retained the same ORF of 597 nu-
cleotides which encodes the same polypeptide as does
the type A cDNA, with a canonical polyadenylation sig-
nal (AATAAA) in the same position as in the type A
cDNA. There are three silent nucleotide substitutions in
the ORF of the genomic sequence in comparison to that
in type A cDNA (Fig. 2B). In addition, one of the ﬁve
repeats of the CAA triplet found in the 3′-UTR of the
type A Itpa cDNA sequence was missing in the genomic
sequence. These results strongly suggest that there are
indeed multiple genomic sequences and transcripts which
are capable of encoding mITPA protein or its variants.
3.2. Transcripts for mouse ITPA expressed in adult
mouse tissue
Since the genomic sequence ampliﬁed with the primer
set I has no intron-like sequence with a complete ORF for
mITPA protein, it is likely that this genomic sequence is
a processed type gene for the mITPA protein. Although
we did not obtain such a sequence in the RT-PCR prod-
ucts from the CCE ES cells with primer set I, it is possible
that the genomic sequence is transcribed in other types of
cells or tissues. To clarify this point, we ampliﬁed cDNA
prepared from various adult mouse tissues using primer
set I, and the RT-PCR products were digested with two
diﬀerent restriction enzymes, ApaLI and Hae II. The for-
mer digests the processed gene-like sequence but not the
three types of cDNA, while the latter digests only the

three types of cDNA for mITPA (Fig. 2B, 3A). A sin-
gle 1108-bp fragment was ampliﬁed from CCE genomic
DNA pre-treated with DNase-free RNase A, while two
or three bands corresponding to 1111-, 832-, or 688-bp
fragments were detected in the RT-PCR products from
all the tissues examined as well as from the CCE cells
(Fig. 3B).
ApaLI digestion of the 1108-bp genomic PCR prod-
uct yielded 814- and 294-bp fragments as predicted from
its sequence (Fig. 3C, lane 10), while no such digested
band was detected in the RT-PCR products from all
adult mouse tissues examined as well as from the CCE
ES cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–9). On the other hand, Hae II
digestion produced 609- and 502-bp fragments from all
RT-PCR products (Fig. 3D, lanes 2–9), and the genomic
PCR product remained undigested (Fig. 3D, lane 10).
From the cDNA prepared from the lung, cerebrum and
cerebellum as well as from CCE cells, three fragments
— 1111-bp, 832-bp, and, to a much lesser extent, 688-bp
fragments — were ampliﬁed, and the latter two fragments
were also digested by Hae II but not by ApaLI. These re-
sults were conﬁrmed by simultaneous digestion with the
two enzymes (Fig. 3E).
As a result, we concluded that the 1108-bp genomic
sequence highly homologous to the mouse Itpa cDNA se-
quence is not transcribed in any of the adult mouse tis-
sues examined so far, and thus we designated the genomic
sequence as Itpa processed pseudogene α (accession no.
AB100502). Furthermore, we conﬁrmed that the three
types of Itpa transcripts identiﬁed in CCE ES cells were
also expressed in adult mouse tissue.
3.3. Type A Itpa mRNA encodes a functional
deoxyinosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase
In order to conﬁrm that a polypeptide encoded by
the type A Itpa transcript possesses the capability of
hydrolyzing nucleotides such as ITP or dITP, the type
A cDNA was placed under the control of T7 pro-
moter in pET8c or pET32a. In E. coli cells harboring
pET8c:mITPA or pET32a:mITPA plasmids, a single 22-
kDa or 34-kDa polypeptide was expressed after IPTG
induction, respectively (Fig. 4A, lanes 5, 11). The for-
mer corresponds to the native mITPA protein with the
expected molecular weight of 21,883 Da, and the latter
is a fusion protein with thioredoxin (Trx-mITPA) whose
molecular weight is predicted to be 33,558 Da. Crude
extracts prepared from E. coli cells harboring vector it-
self or pET8c:mITPA, pET32a:mITPA were incubated
with dITP or dATP, and the reaction products were sepa-
rated on a DEAE column attached to an HPLC system.12
Extracts from E. coli cells harboring vector itself had
no detectable activity to hydrolyze dITP (Fig. 4B, top
panel; Fig. 4C, open circles and squares), while the ex-
tracts from E. coli cells expressing mITPA eﬃciently con-
verted dITP to dIMP (Fig. 4B, bottom panel; Fig. 4C,

RNAs from lung, heart and kidney as well as CCE cells were
pre-treated with RNase-free DNase I before cDNA synthesis in
order to avoid any contamination of genomic DNA. Genomic
DNA from CCE cells was treated with DNase-free RNase A

closed circles). Extracts containing Trx-mITPA also hy-
drolyzed dITP to dIMP (Fig. 4C, closed squares). dATP
was barely hydrolyzed by extracts prepared from E. coli
cells with or without mITPA (Fig. 4C, triangles), thus
demonstrating that mITPA encoded by the type A Itpa
mRNA speciﬁcally hydrolyzes dITP into dIMP.
3.4. Isolation and characterization of mouse Itpa gene
A detailed analysis of mouse genomic sequences re-
vealed that there are several pseudogene-like sequences
highly homologous to mouse Itpa cDNA in the mouse
genome (Table 2). In order to isolate the functional
mouse Itpa gene, we initially intended to isolate unique
intronic sequences for mouse Itpa gene. Based on the ge-
nomic structure of the human ITPA gene consisting of
8 exons and 7 introns,24,25 each exon of the mouse Itpa
gene was predicted based on the type A mouse Itpa cDNA
sequence, and each intron sequence, except for introns 1
and 6, was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA prepared from
CCE ES cells by two primers hybridized to the adjacent
exons (Table 1).
With the genomic fragment containing the intron 2 or 3
as a probe, we applied the retro-recombination method,29
in order to isolate the genomic sequences encompassing
Itpa gene from a λTK phage genomic library derived from
Figure 4. Type A Itpa mRNA encodes functional deoxyi-
nosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase. A. The expression of

D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, 1 mM) was added to the exponen-
tially growing cultures of E. coli BL 21 cells carrying pET8c
(lanes 1, 2), pET8c:mITPA (lanes 4, 5) or pET32a (lanes 8,
9, pET32a:mITPA (lanes 10, 11), and each culture was further
incubated at 37◦C for 3 hr. An aliquot was harvested before

46 Mouse Itpa Gene and its Related Sequences [Vol. 12,
Table 2. Restriction fragments containing a homologous sequence with mouse type A Itpa cDNA predicted from the mouse genome
database.
129 SvJ mouse. Fourteen clones were isolated and classi-
ﬁed into three groups as shown in Fig. 5A. The sequences
of PCR products and λTK phage clones together with the
mouse DNA sequence from clone RP23-175J8 on chro-
mosome 2 (accession no. AL772162) revealed that mouse
Itpa gene consists of 8 exons and 7 introns as expected
from the genomic structure of the human ITPA gene, and
it spans about 13.8 kb of the region on the F3 band of
chromosome 2 (Table 2, Fig. 5A,B). The alignments of
type B and C Itpa cDNA sequences with the genomic se-
quence revealed that the two transcripts are generated by
an unusual joining between exon 5 and exon 8 or between
exon 3 and exon 8, respectively (Fig. 5A).
Type A mRNA, a major transcript from Itpa gene,
is generated by splicing at canonical splice sites with
GT-AG dinucleotides at the splice junctions.32,33 How-
ever, type B and C transcripts are most likely gener-
ated by splicing at non-canonical splices sites with GA-
AG or AA-AG dinucleotides at each unusual splice junc-
tion, respectively (Fig. 5B).33 In both cases, the same
3′-acceptor site in the exon 8 was used. The 5′-donor
sequence (GAGTAC) in exon 3 was also found at the 5′-
end of alternatively spliced exon 8, while the sequence
(CTACAG) at the 3′-end of alternatively spliced exon 5
was also present at the 3′-acceptor site in exon 8, thus
suggesting that these repeated sequences may be involved
in such unusual splicing.
To conﬁrm the genomic structure for the mouse Itpa
gene, genomic DNA prepared from ES cells was digested
with restriction enzymes EcoRI, HindIII or XbaI, and
subjected to Southern blot hybridization with a DNA
fragment containing the entire coding region from type
A cDNA (731 bp) as a probe (Fig. 6). In addition to
the bands expected from the genomic sequence for Itpa
(Table 2; Fig. 6, arrows), three extra bands for each di-
gested sample were identiﬁed which likely represent the
processed pseudogenes α, β, and γ, respectively (Fig. 6,
arrowheads). Among them, the Itpa pseudogene α lo-
cated on chromosome 2E1 has a complete ORF for ex-
actly the same polypeptide as ITPA encoded by the type
A transcript, with a polyadenylation signal (Fig. 2B).
However, we could not detect any transcribed sequence
derived from the Itpa pseudogene α in CCE ES cells or
from any mouse tissues examined, as shown in Fig. 3,
thus concluding that the mouse has only one functional
Itpa gene in its genome.
The existence of such processed pseudogenes in the
mice were conﬁrmed by Southern blot analysis of 129,
C57BL/6J and BALB/c mouse strains, and essentially
the same results were obtained from all strains exam-
ined as well as for CCE ES cells (data not shown). Al-
though there was one more pseudogene-like sequence on
chromosome 6 in the mouse genome database, we could
not identify any band corresponding to the sequence in
our Southern blots (Fig. 6). This may be because the
sequence has much less homology with the Itpa cDNA
probe used.
3.5. Expression of mouse Itpa gene in mouse tissues
and its association with cell proliferation
Expression of Itpa gene in adult mouse tissues was ex-
amined by a Northern blot analysis (Fig. 7A, top panel).
A band corresponding to 1.35 kb in length was detected
in all examined tissues, however, its levels signiﬁcantly
varied from tissue to tissue. Measurements of the ra-
dioactivities of bands on the blot revealed the highest ex-
pression to be seen in the testis and brain, followed by the
thymus (Fig. 7A, lanes 2, 13, 14), and most other tissues
except for smooth muscle, the salivary gland and stom-
ach, expressed about a 50% of the level of Itpa mRNA
detected in the brain or testis (Fig. 7A, bottom panel).
We then monitored the expression of Itpa in serum-
starved BALB/c 3T3 cells with or without serum stimu-
lation (Fig. 7B). A quantitative analysis of the Northern
blots revealed the level of ItpamRNA in quiescent cells to
be low, however, this level increased twofold within 15 hr
after serum stimulation and then gradually decreased af-
ter entering the S phase, 18 hr after serum stimulation,
and then returned to the basal level after 24 hr or later
(Fig. 7C).

gene and its transcripts. The alignment of the DNA fragments derived from mouse genomic libraries is shown in the upper part. The
approximate insertion size of each clone is also shown in parentheses. In the middle part, the structure of the gene, together with
the appropriate restriction enzyme sites (E: EcoRI, H: HindIII, X: XbaI), is shown. The boxes represent the exons for the Itpa gene
and the shaded regions represent the protein-coding region. In the bottom part, three types of alternatively spliced Itpa mRNAs
are shown. The sequence derived from each exon is shown as a box with a number of bases consisting of each exon, and the dashed
lines indicate the normal splicing sites, while solid lines indicate the unusual splicing sites found in type B and type C transcripts. A
number of bases for the protein-coding region derived from exon 1 or exon 8 are shown in parenthesis. B. The nucleotide sequences
of intron/exon boundaries of Itpa gene. The nucleotide sequences of the exons and parts of the introns determined by a comparison
of the sequence of type A Itpa cDNA with the mouse genomic sequence (Accession nos. AL772162, AB101662), are shown in bold
uppercase and lowercase, respectively, and the ﬂanking sequences in plain lowercase. The genomic sequences shown were conﬁrmed
by sequencing of phage clones from a λTK phage genomic DNA library derived from 129SvJ mouse or genomic PCR products. The
start of exon 1 was based on the most 5′-extended EST clone for Itpa mRNA (Accession no. BB654208). The initiation codon ATG,
the termination codon TGA and a putative polyadenylation signal are underlined. The arrows indicate the unusual 5′-splicing sites
in the exon 3 and 5, and the arrowhead indicates the unusual 3′-splicing site in the exon 8, found in type B and type C transcripts.
The dotted lines indicate the repeated sequences at the unusual splicing junctions.

Figure 8. The expression of mouse ITPA protein in mouse tissues. A. Western blotting analysis. Brain extracts (20 µg protein) were
separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting as previously described,31 with preimmune serum (lane 1) or
anti-ITPA serum (lane 2). The arrowhead indicates the 22-kDa polypeptide. B. Immunohistochemistry. Brain (panels a–d) and
liver (panels e, f) sections embedded in paraﬃn blocks were subjected to immunohistochemical analyses with the anti-ITPA serum
(panels b, d, f) and preimmune serum (panels a, c, e) as controls. The nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin (blue).
weight of 22 kDa was reacted with the anti-ITPA serum
but not with preimmune serum (Fig. 8A), thus indicat-
ing that the anti-ITPA serum speciﬁcally reacts with
mouse ITPA in the extract. We could not detect smaller
polypeptides in either cellular or tissue extracts reacted
with the anti-ITPA serum; therefore, it remains to be
established as to whether type B or C Itpa transcripts
produce any polypeptide in vivo.
Next, brain and liver sections embedded in paraﬃn
blocks were subjected to immunohistochemistry using
the anti-ITPA and preimmune sera as controls (Fig. 8B).
In the brain, the anti-ITPA serum exhibited apparent
immunoreactivity throughout the brain section in com-
parison to the preimmune serum (data not shown). In
the brain section, most of the hippocampal neurons in
CA1 to CA3 and DG exhibited relatively strong ITPA
immunoreactivity, especially in the soma of CA3 pyra-
midal cells and mossy ﬁbers (Fig. 8Ba, b). In the cere-
bellum, the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and mossy ﬁbers
in the cerebellar white matter exhibited a strong ITPA
immunoreactivity, while granule cell bodies exhibited a
relatively weak immunoreactivity (Fig. 8c, d). In the
liver, hepatocytes exhibited an evenly distributed ITPA
immunoreactivity mainly in the cytoplasm, and a sig-
niﬁcantly strong immunoreactivity was seen in the cyto-
plasm and nuclei of the epithelial cells lined bile ducts,
and to a lesser extent those of the endothelial cells lined
the portal vein (Fig. 8Be, f).
The expression proﬁle of Itpa suggests that the ITPA
function may be required for proliferative tissues as well
as postmitotic neurons. In neurons, ITPA protein was
mostly detected in the cytoplasm, to a lesser extent in the
nucleus and also in nerve ﬁbers. A particularly high level
of expression was apparent in hippocampal CA3 pyrami-
dal cells and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Those neu-
rons were postmitotic, thus suggesting that ITPA may
function to sanitize the nucleotide pools for RNA syn-
thesis or DNA synthesis in the mitochondria. However,
the PSORT II program (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/) to pre-
dict the protein localization sites in cells,38 predicted that
human and mouse ITPA proteins are likely to mostly lo-
calize in the cytoplasm and some in the nucleus but not
in the mitochondria, and thus ITPA may not function in
mitochondria.
On the other hand, the localization of ITPA in nerve
ﬁbers may indicate that ITP/dITP or XTP/dXTP, sub-
strate nucleotides for ITPA, may be toxic for the neural
function when such abnormal nucleotides accumulated in
the nerve ﬁbers. It is well known that nitric oxide (NO), a
neurotransmitter,39 promotes the deamination of various
molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins,40–42 thus
increasing the intracellular concentration of ITP/dITP
or XTP/dXTP which can be generated by the deami-
nation of ATP/dATP or GTP/dGTP.20 It has recently
been shown that ITP or XTP disturbs the small G pro-
tein function through competition with GTP,43–45 thus
suggesting that the hydrolysis of ITP/XTP by ITPA is
critical for maintaining such signal transduction through
small G proteins, especially in neurons. As a result, ITPA
may protect the neurons from damage caused by these
abnormal nucleotides.
In the liver, a much higher level of ITPA was detected
in the epithelial cell-lined bile duct and also in the en-
dothelial cell-lined portal vein than in hepatocytes. In
the endothelial cells, again NO plays an important role
in regulating vasoconstriction, thus a high level of ITPA
may be required.46 In the bile duct, a high level of ITPA
was detected in the nuclei of epithelial cells, suggesting
that those cells have greater exposure to deamination
by chemicals excreted through the bile duct as well as

50 Mouse Itpa Gene and its Related Sequences [Vol. 12,
NO.47,48
In conclusion, among various genomic sequences highly
homologous to human ITPA coding sequences in the
mouse, the mouse ortholog (mItpa) for hITPA was suc-
cessfully isolated by the retro-recombination method,
while a processed-Itpa gene like sequence and two pseu-
dogenes were also identiﬁed in the mouse genome. Since
no transcribed sequence derived from the processed Itpa-
like sequence was found in any of the examined mouse
tissue specimens, we thus conclude that the mouse has
only one functional Itpa gene, which is highly expressed
in the testis, brain and thymus.
