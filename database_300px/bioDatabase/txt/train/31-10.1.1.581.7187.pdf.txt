ABSTRACT
Based on the experimentally determined atomic
coordinates for RNA helices and the self-avoiding
walks of the P (phosphate) and C4 (carbon) atoms
in the diamond lattice for the polynucleotide loop
conformations, we derive a set of conformational
entropy parameters for RNA pseudoknots. Based
on the entropy parameters, we develop a folding
thermodynamics model that enables us to compute
the sequence-specific RNA pseudoknot folding free
energy landscape and thermodynamics. The model
is validated through extensive experimental tests
both for the native structures and for the fold-
ing thermodynamics. The model predicts strong
sequence-dependent helix-loop competitions in the
pseudoknot stability and the resultant confor-
mational switches between different hairpin and
pseudoknot structures. For instance, for the pseudo-
knot domain of human telomerase RNA, a native-like
and a misfolded hairpin intermediates are found to
coexist on the (equilibrium) folding pathways, and
the interplay between the stabilities of these inter-
mediates causes the conformational switch that
may underlie a human telomerase disease.
INTRODUCTION
RNA pseudoknot structure is defined as a structure with base
pairing between a loop and other regions of the RNA. The
simplest RNA pseudoknot is the H-type pseudoknot, where
a hairpin loop base pair with a single stranded region outside
the hairpin. A simple pseudoknot is composed of two helix
stems and two loops that span across the helix stems. RNA
pseudoknots play an indispensable role in the structures and
functions of many RNAs (1–13). For example, in the transla-
tion of many viruses, the downstream pseudoknots play a
crucial role to promote the frameshifting (14–20). The bio-
logical functions of a pseudoknot are directly related to the
folding stability and the conformational changes. In an RNA
pseudoknot, the stability and folding thermodynamics are
largely determined by the interplay between the loops and
the helical stems. For example, pseudoknot folding can be
cooperative or noncooperative, which involves several inter-
mediates in the folding process. Some of the folding inter-
mediates may be native-like, or misfolded, which cannot be
formed from the native helix stems (21–23). To predict
how RNA pseudoknot folds, including the formation of all
the possible the native-like and misfolded intermediates and
the folding stability and cooperativity, it is essential to have
an accurate model that can predict not only the native state,
but also all the possible native-like and misfolded states.
The availability of such a model would be useful to extract
the information about the conformational changes and the
folding energetics from the experimentally measured thermal
melting curves.
To predict the folding thermodynamics requires (i) the
energy parameters for the evaluation of the energy for a
given conformation and (ii) the chain entropy. While the
energy of a pseudoknot can be obtained from the nearest
neighbor interaction model, which gives the energy (entropy)
as the sum of the energy (entropy) parameter for each base
stack in the helices, the chain entropy calculation requires a
model. The evaluation of the chain entropy has become one
of the bottlenecks for modeling RNA pseudoknot folding.
For a pseudoknot, the two loops span across the deep and
the shallow grooves of the helix stems, respectively (See
Figure 1a). The (narrow) deep and the (wide) shallow grooves
correspond to the major and the minor grooves of the helix
stems, respectively. Therefore, the loop conformations are
strongly dependent on the helix that the loop spans across.
The stem–loop correlation, such as the volume exclusion
makes the loop entropy calculation very complex, because
the loop and helix conformations must be treated together
when evaluating the loop entropy. As a result of the stem–
loop correlation, the conformational entropy of pseudoknots
are nonadditive, i.e. the pseudoknot entropy cannot be cal-
culated as the additive sum of the entropies of the helix
and the (helix-free) loops.
Despite the extensive experimental studies on RNA
pseudoknot folding thermodynamics (21–29), our ability to
quantitatively predict RNA pseudoknot structure and folding

stability is very limited (30–34). This is mainly due to lacking
of the thermodynamic parameters, especially the chain
entropy parameters. The dynamic programming described
in Ref. (30) provides an efficient computational algorithm
for the structure prediction for pseudoknotted RNAs. Based
on ad hoc assumptions, Gultyaev et al. (35) compiled a
table for the loop entropies for different loop length and
helix length. Later, using the Gaussian chain approximation,
Aalberts et al. (36) developed a model to estimate the loop
entropies. The model is based on the polymer physics and
neglects the atomic details of the loop conformations and
the excluded volume interactions. Based on the model,
Aalberts et al. performed an analysis for the asymmetry in
the pseudoknot structure. Recently, based on the lattice mod-
els for chain conformations, Lucas et al. (37) and Kopeikin
et al. (38,39) developed theories for pseudoknots and for
simple RNA tertiary folds, respectively. These lattice-based
physical models can rigorously treat the excluded volume
effects but cannot treat atomic details and are thus unable
to treat realistic RNA conformations.
In the present study, we present a virtual bond model for
RNA pseudoknot conformations and conformational entropy
(40–42). The model can account for the atomic details of
the conformations. Specifically, we model the helix stems
using the NMR measured coordinates (43) and model the
loop conformations across the deep and shallow grooves as
self-avoiding walks of the nucleotide virtual bonds in a dia-
mond lattice. The atomic coordinates of the helices and the
lattice representation for the loops are matched at the loop-
helix junction, where steric viability is accounted for. When
computing the conformational entropy, we explicitly account
for the volume exclusion between different nucleotides. From
the statistical mechanical model, we compute the free energy
landscapes and the base pairing probability at different tem-
peratures, from which the native and intermediate structures,
the equilibrium folding pathways, the folding cooperativity
and the stabilities can be obtained. RNA pseudoknots can
be classified into several different types. In this study, we
treat not only the simple H-type pseudoknots, but also the
more complex pseudoknots, e.g. the TYMV and TMV
pseudoknot structures.
THEORY AND MODEL
Structural model for pseudoknot
A simple (H-type) pseudoknot consists of two stems (S1 and
S2 in Figure 1a) and two loops (L1 and L2 in Figure 1a). In
Figures 1b and c, we show the secondary structure and the
corresponding positions of the P and the C4 atoms for the
gene 32 mRNA pseudoknot of bacteriophage T2 (43). As
shown in the Figure, stems S1 and S2 are linked by loops
L1 and L2, which span across the deep and shallow grooves,
respectively.
The loop conformations are dependent on the helix stems
through the chain connectivity and the stem–loop volume
exclusion. As a result, the pseudoknot loop entropy is
dependent on multiple parameters: the loop entropy is deter-
mined not only by the loop length, but also by the helix stem
length and structure. Due to the enormously large parameter

space (different possibilities for the helix stem length and the
loop length), it is practically impossible to rely only on
experiments to obtain exhaustively all the possible pseudo-
knot loop entropies. We need a computational model to cal-
culate the pseudoknot loop entropy. Moreover, to extract the
loop entropy parameter from the experiments also requires a
model. In this work, we develop a statistical mechanical
model to compute the pseudoknot entropy, from which we
can obtain the pseudoknot folding free energy landscapes,
the folding stability and the conformational changes.
We use the virtual bond model to describe the H-
pseudoknot conformations. Since the C-O torsions in the
nucleotide backbone have high propensity to be in the
trans (t) rotational isomeric state, the P-O5-C5-C4 bonds
and the C4-C3-O3-P bonds in a nucleotide backbone can be
treated as planar (40). This makes it possible to describe
the nucleotide backbone conformations through two effective
bonds: the P-C4 and the C4-P bonds. The P
ðiÞCðiÞ4 (i ¼ 1, 2
and 3) and the C
ðiÞ
4 Pðiþ1Þ (i ¼ 1 and 2) in the 50!30 direction
are called virtual bonds (see Figure 1d). In our model, we use
the experimentally determined atomic coordinates to model
the virtual bonds of the helix stems. For the loop region, of
which the virtual bonds are more flexible, we use self-
avoiding random walks in a diamond lattice to model
the conformations.
Helix. For the helix stems, we use the P and C4 atomic coor-
dinates in the NMR structure of gene 32 mRNA pseudoknot
of bacteriophage T2; see Figure 1c. In gene 32 mRNA
pseudoknot, the lengths of stems S1 and S2 are respectively
5 and 7 bp. For helix stems of other lengths, we use the
gene 32 mRNA pseudoknot helix as a template to generate
the P and C4 atomic coordinates through the virtual bond tor-
sional angles (h,q) and the bond angles (bP, bC) (42);
see Figure 1d. The virtual bond torsional angles (h, q) in
the helix are (170, 210) (41) and the bond angles (bP, bC)
are (105 ± 5, 95 ± 5) for a rigid A-RNA helix (44).
Loop. As shown in Figures 1b and c, loops L1(A8) and
L2(U21 ! G27) span across the deep narrow and shallow
wide grooves, respectively. The two loops have quite differ-
ent spatial configurations. For example, the loop end–end dis-
tance, defined as the distance between the C4 atom at the
helix-loop junction and the C4 atom on the other end of the
stem, shows different stem length-dependence for the two
loops. Shown in Figure 2a are the results from our virtual
bond model for the end–end distances, denoted as DL1 and
DL2 for loops L1 and L2, respectively. The two loops show
very different behaviors. As the helix stem length is
increased, DL2 increases monotonically while DL1 decreases
until stem length S2 ¼ 6 then increases. Our findings here
are consistent with the experimental observation (45).
The above intriguing differences in the stem length-
dependence of DL1 and DL2 are due to the different geome-
tries of the narrow and wide grooves. For the deep narrow
groove, the minimum distance between the two paired helical
strands is between two non-pairing nucleotides separated by a
few base pairs apart instead of between two base paired
nucleotides. So the minimum end–end distance for L1 occurs
when the helix stem S2 has a length of a few base pairs. More-
over, for narrow deep grooves, the minimum end–end dis-
tance is small, so L1 can be as short as a single nucleotide,
as shown in Figures 1b and c. On the other hand, for the shal-
low wide groove, the minimum inter-strand distance occurs
between two pairing nucleotides and hence the end–end dis-
tance of L2 increases monotonically with the helix stem S1. In
addition, the minimum end–end distance is large, so a single
nucleotide loop cannot form a viable structure for L2.
In our model, we use diamond lattice to configure the loop
conformations. This is because the three torsional angles of
the diamond lattice bonds (g+, t, g) represent the typical
rotational isomeric states t and g± of a polymer and thus
the diamond lattice conformations may well represent the
conformational ensemble of a realistic loop. We model loop
conformations as self-avoiding walks of the virtual bonds (i.e.
the P and the C4 atoms) in the diamond lattice. The bond
length of the diamond lattice is equal to the length of a virtual
bond 3.9 s. Furthermore, in order to connect the loop to the
helix, we map the P and C4 coordinates of the helices onto the

closest diamond lattice sites. Such coarse-grained approach
causes a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of about
2.2 s for the helix.
Pseudoknot entropy
At the center of the statistical thermodynamics is the parti-
tion function Q, defined as the sum over all the possible
structures:
Q ¼
X
s
WseEs/kBT 1
where s denotes a structure. Here a structure is defined by the
helices. So a given structure would have fixed loop lengths
but can have different loop conformations, which cause dif-
ferent pseudoknot conformations. Ws denotes the number of
pseudoknot conformations accessible to the structure s, and
Es is the energy (enthalpy) of s. The sum
P
s is for all the
possible structures that contain RNA secondary structures
and pseudoknotted structures. For a given pseudoknot struc-
ture s, Es can be evaluated from the nearest neighbor model
using the experimentally measured enthalpy parameters for
the base stacks, while Ws can be obtained from the computa-
tional model developed here. Given the fixed coordinates of
the helix stems, the entropy of the pseudoknot is determined
by the loops. So the main focus for Ws calculation is to com-
pute the loop entropies in the presence of the fixed helix
stems in the structure.
We decompose a pseudoknot into two subunits, each con-
sisting of a stem and the corresponding loop: S1 + L2 and
S2 + L1. Due to the loop-helix volume exclusion, the loop
entropies are dependent on the length of the corresponding
helix stems (namely, stem S1 for loop L2, and stem S2 for
loop L1). The strategy in our theory is to first compute the
loop entropies for L1 and L2 separately, then combine the sub-
units to obtain the entropy of the whole pseudoknot.
To ensure the steric compatibility for the connections
between the subunits, we configure the P and the C4 atoms
in the loop-helix junction regions onto the closest diamond
lattice sites. For example, for the pseudoknot structure
shown in Figure 1b, we fit the P and the C4 atomic coordi-
nates for C7, G9, A20 and U28 onto the diamond lattice.
Furthermore, in order to consider the excluded volume
between the loops and helices, we also fit stems S1 and S2
onto the diamond lattice.
We compute the number of conformations for each subunit
(S1 + L2 and S2 + L1) separately through exact computer enu-
meration for the self-avoiding walks in the diamond lattice.
We denote the conformational counts as wL1 and wL2 for
the two loops, respectively. If we neglect the excluded vol-
ume interaction between the two loops, the pseudoknot con-
formational count can be computed as
Ws ¼ wL1 · wL2 2
where wLi denotes the number of the conformations of
loop Li. Figure 3 shows that the conformational entropy com-
puted from Equation 2 gives accurate results as tested against
the exact computer enumeration. From Equation 2, the key
for the pseudoknot conformational entropy calculation is to
compute the conformational count wLi for the loops.
In Table 1, we show our results from exact computer
enumeration for the two loops. The results are given as the
loop entropy parameters defined as the following.
DSLi ¼ kB lnwcoil ðLiÞ/wLi 3
Here DSLi is the loop entropy for loop Li, wcoil (Li) is the num-
ber of the corresponding coil conformations for Li. To obtain
wcoil(Li) and wLi , we enumerate the number of self-avoiding
loop conformations on the diamond lattice. The volume
exclusion between different monomers in the loop and
between the loop and the helix (S1 for L2 and S2 for L1) are
rigorously accounted for. We note that due to the discreteness
of the virtual bond configurations in the diamond lattice, cer-
tain conformations with long helix stems and very short loops
cannot be realized in the diamond lattice. However, these
loops, which are denoted by * in Table 1, may be viable in
realistic structures. For these special loops, the conformations
would be very restricted, so we assume their loop entropies
are equal to the minimal loop entropies.
We denote the loop length by l (nt). For large loops
(l > 12 nt), the enumeration of the loop conformations is
not possible because of the exponentially increasing compu-
tational time. According to the results from the exact com-
puter enumeration for l < 12 nt loops, we fit the following
formula for the loop entropies:
lnwLi ¼ a ln ðl  lmin þ 1Þ þ bðl  lmin þ 1Þ þ c;
lnwcoil ðLiÞ ¼ 2:14 l þ 0:10
4
where lmin is the minimal loop length to form a H-pseudoknot
for the given helix stem (S1 for L2 and S2 for L1). The lmin
values for different helix stems are obtained from the exp-
erimental data (35,45). The above equations combined with
Equation 3 give the loop entropies for a pseudoknot (46–48).
In Table 2, we present our results for (lmin, a, b, c) for L1
(across the narrow groove of S2) and L2 (across the wide
groove of S1). To test the accuracy of the above fitted loop

entropy formula, in Figure 2b we show the comparison
between Equation 4 and the results from the exact computer
enumeration. We find that the above fitted formula can indeed
provide good approximations for the loop entropies.
From Table 1 and Figure 2b, we find that the loop entropy
jDSLi j ¼ kB lnwcoil ðLiÞ/wLi shows an intriguing loop length-
dependence. As the loop size l is increased, we find that (i)
jDSL1 j and (ii) jDSL2 j for short helix stem S1 would monotoni-
cally increase. However, for loop L2 with longer helix stem
S1, we find a non-monotonic behavior: jDSL2 j first decreases
for small l and then increases for large l. Such non-monotonic
behavior for L2, the loop spanning across the minor groove, is
evident from the exact computer enumeration results (e.g.
DSL2 for stem length S1 ¼ 4 bp in Table 1 and in Figure 2b).
In the following, we explain why the pseudoknot loop
entropies show such distinctive behavior.
If the helix has zero or weak excluded volume, the loop
entropy jDSLi j would increase monotonically with the loop
size l, because wcoil (Li) increases faster with the loop length
l than wLi . With the helix stem S2, L1 spans across the deep
narrow groove of the helix S2 and can thus have a small
end–end distance. For a small end-end distance (compared
to the loop length), the probability for the loop to bump
into the helix is small, i.e. the excluded volume of the helix
is rather weak. Therefore, jDSL1 j increases monotonically
with l, for L2, which span across the wide shallow groove
of helix S1, the loop end–end distance for a long helix S1
can be large. Consequently, for a short loop length l, the
volume exclusion between the loop (L2) and the helix (S1)
can be very strong. For such case, a small increase of the
loop length l can greatly weaken the loop-helix volume
exclusion, causing a notable increase in the number of loop

The upper half of the Table gives (DSL1/kB) for loop L1 as a function of the S2 helix stem length and the L1 loop length. The lower half of the Table gives (DSL2/kB) for
loop L2 as a function of the S1 helix stem length and the L2 loop length. See Figure 1 for the stem–loop construct of a pseudoknot. The * entries in the Table indicate the
long stem and short loop structures that cannot be realized in the diamond lattice but may be viable for a realistic pseudoknot. For these restricted loops, we use the
entropies of the minimal loop lengths for the same helix length.

conformations wL2 . This would result in a decrease injDSL2 j ¼ kB lnwcoil ðL2Þ/wL2 . Therefore, jDSL2 j decreases with
l for a long S1 stem. For large loops, the loop-helix volume
exclusion becomes relatively weak and thus jDSL2 j increases
with l.
The above excluded volume-caused non-monotonic DSL2
is supported by the results from the exhaustive computer
enumeration. First, the results for S1 ¼ 4 bp in Table 1
shows a non-monotonic loop length-dependence; see also
Figure 2b. Second, for longer S1 stems, the loop-helix
excluded volume interaction is strong and thus the non-
monotonic behavior would be more pronounced. For exam-
ple, jDSL2 j for S1 ¼ 6 bp decreases from 11.9 to 9.8 kB as
the loop length l is increased from 7 to 12 nt. This implies
a non-monotonic behavior, because for a very large l
(
 end–end distance of the loop), the loop-helix excluded
volume interaction is weak, resulting in a monotonically
increasing loop entropy.
Though we are lacking in exact computer enumeration
data for very large loops due to the extremely demanding
computational time for exhaustive enumeration, broad
experimental tests presented in the following sections suggest
that the loop entropy parameters given in Table 1 and
Equation 4 may be reliable for the loop sizes tested. In addi-
tion, the entropy parameters derived here might be suffice
for biologically significant sequences, which are unlikely to
involve very large loops (length 
12 nt). With the increasing
availability of the experimentally measured loop entropy
data, further refinements for Equation 4, which is accurate
only for short and mid-size loops, can be possible.
Our current model has two advantages. First, the model is
based on the virtual bond representation of the atomic P and
C4 atoms of the nucleotides, so the model can treat atomic
details. Second, the model explicitly accounts for the
excluded volume interactions between the helices and the
loops and between the loop nucleotides. In the following sec-
tions, based on the pseudoknot entropy parameters that we
derived, we compute the partition function and the native
structure as well as the folding free energy landscape for
RNA pseudoknots. Through extensive experimental com-
parisons on the native structures and the melting curves, we
validate the entropy model.
Partition function
In this section, we develop a recursive algorithm (42,49,50)
to compute the partition function for all the possible struc-
tures that contain pseudoknots and secondary structures.
In order to account for the excluded volume interactions
between different structural subunits, we classify different
conformational types. A chain segment from nucleotides a
to b is connected to the rest of the molecule at the terminal
nucleotides a and b. To account for the conformational viabil-
ity between the chain segments, we classify the conforma-
tional types according to the excluded volume near a and b.
We assume that a lone base pair is not stable, so we classify
structures according to base stacks.
(i) We classify conformations according to whether the
terminal nucleotides a and b are involved in base pair or
not: the conformation is ‘closed’ if both a and b are
involved in base pairing (such as the structures shown in
Figures 4b, c and f) and is ‘open’ otherwise (such as
the structure shown in Figures 4a and d). It is important
to note that for a closed conformation, a and b can
either base pair with each other (such as the hairpin
structure shown in Figure 4f) or with different
nucleotides (such as the pseudoknot structure shown in
Figure 4f).
(ii) For the open conformations, according to whether the
nucleotides adjacent to the terminal nucleotides (a and b
in Figure 4), i.e., nucleotides a1 and bn in Figure 4, are
involved in base pairing, we classify four types of
conformations (see Figure 4d):
type — LR if a1 is adjacent to a and bn is adjacent to b;
type — L if only a1 is adjacent to a;
type — R if only bn is adjacent to b;
type — M if neither a1 nor bn is adjacent to a or b: 5
For convenience, we use the following rules in our nota-
tions: C ¼ ‘partition function for the closed conformations’,
O ¼ ‘partition function for the open conformations’, subscript
‘2’ ¼ secondary structures, ‘3’ ¼ pseudoknots, ‘23’ ¼ sec-
ondary structures + pseudoknots. For example, C2(a, b) and
Ot2ða‚bÞ (t ¼ L, R, M and LR) are the partition functions
for the closed secondary structures and the open secondary
structures for a chain segment from a to b, respectively.
Closed conformations. The partition function for the closed
conformations from a to b can be calculated as the sum of
the partition functions for all the possible closed secondary
structures without pseudoknot C2(a, b) and for all the possible
structures with pseudoknots C3(a, b):
C23ða‚bÞ ¼ C2ða‚bÞ þ C3ða‚bÞ 6
C2(a, b) can be calculated from the dynamic program by
growing the chain step by step as described in equations
12–16 in the Appendix. C3(a, b) can be computed from the
sum over all the possibilities for the helix stem lengths S1
and S2 and the loop lengths L1, L2 and L3 as shown in
Figure 4f:

where DG(S1, S2, L1, L2, L3) is the free energy of the pseudo-
knot, which can be obtained from the loop entropy para-
meters in Tables 1 and 2 and the enthalpy and entropy
parameters for the helices. In the Results and Discussion sec-
tion, we illustrate the detailed calculation of the pseudoknot
free energy.
Open conformations. The partition function for the open con-
formations (with pseudoknots) Ot23ða‚bÞ (t ¼ conformational
type L, M, R, LR; see Figure 4d) can be computed from the
same recursive relations as the ones that we have derived
for the secondary structures; see Equations 13–16 in the
Appendix with C2 and O2 replaced by C23 and O23, res-
pectively. From the recursive relations and Equation 17, we
can compute efficiently the partition function Ot23ða‚bÞ for
any chain segment from a to b.

Total partition function. Through the recursive relation, we
can treat not only the simple pseudoknots, secondary struc-
tures, but also more complex structures with both secondary
structures and pseudoknots (see Figure 5a) and structures
with multiple pseudoknots (see Figure 5b). As shown in
Figure 4d, we can treat structures with one or more closed
conformations connected in series, where each closed con-
formation can be in the form of a secondary structure or a
pseudoknot as shown in Figure 4f, or a mixture of secondary
and pseudoknotted structures.
The total partition function Q(a, b) for a chain from a to
b is given by the sum of the partition functions for all the
different types of conformations:

length N as O(N6) and the memory scales as O(N2).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Pseudoknot free energy calculation
For a pseudoknot with helix stem lengths S1 and S2 and loop
lengths L1, L2 and L3 as shown in Figure 4f, the pseudoknot
free energy DG(S1, S2, L1, L2, L3) can be computed as the
sum of the free energies of the stems, loops and possibly
the coaxial-stacking.
DGðS1‚S2‚L1‚L2‚L3Þ ¼ DGS1 þ DGS2TDSL1  TDSL2
þ DGcs þ DGassemble 8
Here DSLi is the entropy of loop Li (see Equation 3), DGSi (i ¼
1, 2) is the free energy of helix stem Si, and DGcs is the
free energy of the coaxial stack between the two helices (51).
DGassemble in Equation 8 is introduced to account for the
entropy change as the two subunits (L1 + S2 and L2 + S1)
are assembled into the pseudoknot. In Equation 3 (and
Table 1), wL1 and wL2 are computed with the presence of
the helices, therefore, the number of conformations for the
assembled pseudoknot can be calculated as Ws ¼ wL1 wL2 as
in Equation 2. On the other hand, wcoil (Li) for L1 and L2 are
calculated as two separate chains. As the two (coil) chains
are assembled to form a longer chain, due to the different
ways for the connection between the two chains, the total
number of coil chain conformations is given by wassemble ·
wcoil (L1) · wcoil (L2), where wassemble 3 · 3 ¼ 9 is the number
of conformations for the junction nucleotide (¼ two virtual
bonds, each with three possible orientations) between

the two chains. The corresponding free energy for the
wassemble effect is DGassemble = kBT lnwassemble  kBT ln 9 ’
1.3 kcal/mol at T ¼ 37C.
In Equation 8, we have neglected the loop enthalpy and the
stability of the single strand segment L3, which is assumed to
be short and flexible. From the NMR structural studies
(43,52), the two stems in the pseudoknot can be coaxially
stacked. Especially for L3 ¼ 0 the two stems can be juxta-
posed into coaxial positions and we need to consider the
coaxial stacking in the stability calculation.
For a given pseudoknot structure, we obtain (i) the loop
entropies DSLi (i ¼ 1, 2) from Tables 1 and 2, (ii) the helix
free energy DGSi ¼ DHSiTDSSi from the nearest neighbor
interaction model with the enthalpy DHSi and the entropy
DSSi parameters computed from the Turner rule (53), and
(iii) the coaxial stacking free energy DGcs from the sequence-
dependent parameters in Ref. (51).
Using Equation 8, we can compute the free energy for
simple H-pseudoknots, such as the T4-35 pseudoknot
shown in Figures 6c and 7a. For more complex structures,
which involve multiple pseudoknots or a mixture of the pseu-
doknots and secondary structures, such as the TYMV and
TMV structures shown in Figures 5a and 5b respectively,
we can estimate the total free energy of the structure as the
sum of the free energy of the component structures (pseudo-
knots, secondary structures). In this section, using T4-35,
TYMV and TMV pseudoknots as three representative exam-
ples for the different levels of complexity, we show how to
compute the pseudoknot free energy using our loop entropy
parameters. For all the illustrative calculations in this section,
we assume temperature T ¼ 37C.
T4-35 pseudoknot. For the T4-35 pseudoknot shown in
Figures 6c and 7a, there are two stems S1 (¼5 bp) and
S2 (¼7 bp) and two loops L1 (¼1 nt) and L2 (¼4 nt).
(i) (Stems S1 and S2): The nearest neighbor interaction
model with the base stack thermodynamic parameters
(53) gives the stabilities (in kcal/mol) for stems S1 and
S2: DGS1 ¼ 6:6; DGS2 ¼ 11:2:
(ii) (Loops L1 and L2): (L2, S1) ¼ (4 nt, 5 bp), (L1, S2) ¼
(1 nt, 7 bp). From the lower (upper) half of Table 1 for
L2 (L1), we find DSL2 ¼ 9:8 kB and DSL1 ¼ 2:3 kB.
(iii) (T4-28 pseudoknot): The stability of the T4–28
pseudoknot (without coaxial stacking) at T ¼ 37C ¼
310 K (kBT ¼ 0.62 kcal/mol) is equal to:
DG ¼ DGS1 þ DGS2  TðDSL1 þ DSL2Þ þ DGassemble
¼ ð6:6Þ þ ð11:2Þ þ ð6:1Þ þ ð1:4Þ þ ð1:3Þ
¼ 9:0 ðkcal/molÞ 9
The above calculated free energy is close to the experi-
mentally measured 8.1 kcal/mol in the mixed 3 mM Mg2+
and 50 mM Na+ ion condition (24). If we include the
coaxial stacking (through the base stack 50AG-CU30), which
has (DH, DS) ¼ (12.5 kcal/mol, 32.6 cal/mol/K) (51),
the pseudoknot stability would be changed to DG ¼
2.5 kcal/mol, which disagrees with the experimental result.
Therefore, coaxial stacking is unlikely to play a role in the
T4–35 pseudoknot. The NMR studies for T2 pseudoknot
(43) indicate that the C7–G16 base pair in the helix–helix
junction is over-rotated by 18 compared with a continuous
A-form helix. This may result in the disruption of the
coaxial stacking in the junction. Therefore, our theoretical
prediction is in accordance with the experiment.
TYMV pseudoknot. As shown in Figure 5a, the TYMV
pseudoknot consists of two parts: a hairpin denoted as
C2-1 from C1 to G15 and a pseudoknot denoted as C3-1
from C16 to A39.
(i) (Hairpin C2-1): The nearest neighbor interaction model
gives the stability DGC21 ¼ 3.9 kcal/mol.
(ii) (Pseudoknot C3-1):
(a) (Stems S1 and S2): The nearest neighbor model
gives the stabilities (in kcal/mol) for stems 1 and 2:
DGS1 ¼ 6:0 and DGS2 ¼ 10:5
(b) (Loops L1 and L2): (L2, S1) ¼ (3 nt, 3bp), (L1, S2) ¼ 3
nt, 6 bp). From the lower (upper) half of Table 1 for L2
(L1), we find DSL2 ¼ 6:5kB and DSL1 ¼ 4:8kB.
(c) (Pseudoknot C3-1): The stability for pseudoknot C3-1
is equal to
DGC31 ¼DGS1 þDGS2TðDSL2 þDSL1ÞþDGassemble
¼8:2 ðkcal/molÞ
(iii) (TYMV pseudoknot): The total stability for the TYMV
pseudoknot is given as below.
DGtot ¼ DGC21 þDGC31 þDG0cs
¼ DGC21 þDGC31 þDGð50GCGC30Þ
¼ 3:9þð8:2Þþ ð4:3Þ ¼16:4 ðkcal/molÞ
10
where DG0CS is the coaxial stacking free energy between
stem 0 in the hairpin C2-1 and stem 1 in the pseudoknot
C3-1. The DG0cs parameter is from Ref. (51).
If we include the (50AG-CU30) coaxial stacking between
stems 1 and 2 within the C3-1 pseudoknot (51), the total
stability would become 18.9 kcal/mol.
TMV pseudoknot. As shown in Figure 5b, the TMV pseudo-
knotted structure consists of three H-pseudoknots (C3-1, C3-2
and C3-3).
(i) (Stems): From the nearest neighbor model and the
thermodynamic parameters for the base stacks (53),
we obtain the stabilities (in kcal/mol) for the six
helix stems (two in each pseudoknot): DGS1 ¼ 7:3;
DGS2 ¼5:9; DGS01 ¼4:1; DGS02 ¼10:4; DGS001 ¼5:6;DG

(ii) (Loops L1, L1

narrow grooves of stems 2, 20, and 200, with [loop length
(nt), stem length (bp)] ¼ [1, 4], [1, 6], and [5, 5],
respectively. From the upper half of Table 1, we have
DSL1 ¼ 4:4 kB; DSL01 ¼ 2:3 kB; DSL001 ¼ 6:0 kB:
(iii) (Loops L2, L2
0, L200): These loops span across the wide
shallow grooves of stems 1, 10, and 100, with [loop
length (nt), stem length (bp)] ¼ [4, 4], [3, 3], and [7, 4],
respectively. From the lower half of Table 1, we have
DSL2 ¼ 9:2 kB; DSL02 ¼ 6:5 kB; DSL002 ¼ 8:9 kB:

Figure 6. The comparison between the calculated melting curves and the experimentally measured results for eight pseudoknots sequences (a) T4–28, (b) T4–32,
(c) T4–35 (24,26), (d) G80 (23), (e) mIAP (27), (f) the telomerase pseudoknot domain (PKWT), (g) (28) and (h) (29) are two mutants of the telomerase pseudoknot
domain. The Y-axis is the heat capacity. The calculated melting curves have been normalized such that the theoretical and the experimental curves have the same peak
value. The ion conditions are 50 mM NaCl and 1.0 mM Mg2+ for (a), (b) and (c), 1 M KCl for (d), 50 mM KCl for (e), 200 mM KCl for (f), (g) and 200 mM NaCl for (h).
Because our calculated enthalpic and entropic parameters for the base stacks are from Turner’s rules for 1 M NaCl salt condition, our model generally overestimates
the melting temperatures. Results with and without coaxial stacking (CS) are both presented.

(iv) (Pseudoknots C31, C32, C33): From the above
parameters for the helices and the loops, we use
Equation 8 to obtain the stability (in kcal/mol) for each
pseudoknot. We have DGC31 ¼ 3:5, DGC32 ¼ 7:7,
DGC33 ¼ 3:4:
(v) (TMV pseudoknot): The stability for TMV pseudoknot
is equal to

¼ ð3:5Þ þ ð7:7Þ þ ð3:4Þ þ ð3:5Þ þ ð1:1Þ
¼ 19:2 ðkcal/molÞ
where DGcsij is the free energy of coaxial stacking
between stems i and j. The coaxial stacking between
C3  1 and C3  2 is through the 50AC-GU30 base stack
between stem 2 and stem 10, and the coaxial stacking
between C3  2 and C3  3 is through the 50AU-UG30
base stack between stem 20 and stem 100. We note that the
coaxial stacking parameter for 50UA-UG30 is not listed
in Ref. (51), so we use the stacking energy from the
Turner rule (53).
The two stems in each H-pseudoknot element may also be
coaxially stacking. The coaxial base stack 50GU-AC30
between stems 1 and 2 can stabilize C3-1 by 3.5 kcal/mol,
and the base stack 50UA-UA30 between stem 10 and stem
20 can stabilize C3-2 by 2.2 kcal/mol. For C3-3, however,
the coaxial stacking, if formed, would involve a noncanonical
base pair (C-A) and would be unstable. So we ignored the
coaxial stacking for C3-3. The total extra stability provided
by the coaxial stacking within the H-pseudoknot elements
(C3-1 and C3-2) could reach (3.5) + (2.2) ¼ 5.7 kcal/mol.
Pseudoknot structure prediction
The probability Pij for the formation of a base pair (i, j) can
be calculated from the conditional partition function Qij for
the ensemble of conformations with base pair (i, j) formed:
Pij ¼ Qij/Q. From the distribution of the base pairing pro-
bability, we can deduce the stable structures for a given tem-
perature T. Specifically, the structural prediction involves the
following two steps. We first compute Pij for all the possible
base pairs (i, j). From Pij, we identified the helices as the
consecutive (i, j) pairs with large Pij values. For example,

the density plot for Pij in Figure 5a for the TYMV pseudoknot
has three trains of dark dots (¼ large Pij’s), indicating three
stables helices (stems 1, 2 and 3).
We predict the stable structures at T ¼ 37C for
pseudoknot-forming sequences which have known experi-
mentally measured native structures. We quantify the accu-
racy of our predictions using the sensitivity (SE) and the
specificity (SP) parameters (54,55). The SE is defined as
the ratio between the number of the correctly predicted
base pairs and the number of the base pairs in the experi-
mental determined structure, and the SP is defined as the
ratio between the number of the correctly predicted base
pairs and the number of base pairs in the predicted structure.
A perfect prediction would have (SP, SE) ¼ (1.0, 1.0) and
a completely failed prediction would have (SP, SE) ¼
(0.0, 0.0). NMR experiments suggest that the two stems in
an H-type pseudoknot can be coaxial (43,52,56) or bent
(18,57), so we perform our computations for two cases
(with and without coaxial stacking) separately.
Viral ribosomal frameshift signals and viral ribosomal
readthrough signals pseudoknots. In Table 3, we summarize
the accuracy of our theoretical predictions for the native
structures with coaxial stacking for 15 viral ribosomal frame-
shift signals and 7 viral ribosomal readthrough signals pseu-
doknots (58). We truncate the sequences and retain only the
pseudoknot portions; see Table 3 for the sequences. For the
viral ribosomal frameshift signals, BEV, EAV, HCV-229E,
LDV-C and RSV sequences are not included because the
computational time is demanding for these long (>100 nt)
sequences. From Table 3, we find that, except for the BLV
and CABYV sequences, our model can give good predictions
for all the other 20 sequences. If the second lowest free
energy structure is also considered, the predictions for BLV
and CABYV would be exact (see Table 3). For BLV, the pre-
dicted alternative structure is a hairpin formed through the
disruption of the helix stem close to the 30 end in the native
pseudoknot. The hairpin is predicted to be more stable than
the native pseudoknot by 0.7 kcal/mol. For CABYV, the
model predicts a misfolded hairpin with the helix stem
formed by the base pairs from G1495–C1511 to G1501–
C1505. The misfolded hairpin is predicted to be 1.6 kcal/
mol more stable than the native pseudoknot. The inaccuracy
in the predictions for the BLV and CABYV pseudoknots may
be caused by the neglected tertiary interactions, such as base
triples. The A·(C-G) and C·(C-G) base triples have been
found to significantly stabilize the ribosomal frameshifting
pseudoknots (18–20), such as ScYLV and BWYV, and may
also play important roles in the BLV and CABYV stabilities.
As a test, we also predict the pseudoknots without con-
sidering the coaxial stacking. We find that removing the
coaxial stacking causes no change in the predicted native
pseudoknot except for three sequences: PEMV, PLRV-S
and FeLV, for which the predicted structures become signifi-
cantly less accurate with (SE, SP) ¼ (0.60, 0.86), (0.50, 0.40)
and (0.57, 0.53), respectively. This clearly shows that the
coaxial stacking is an important stabilizing force for these
pseudoknots. More specifically, PEMV and PLRV-S are
stabilized by the coaxial stacking 50UC-GA30 and FeLV is
stabilized by the coaxial stacking 50CC-GG30. The energy
parameter for the 50UC-GA30 coaxial stacking is not listed
in Ref. (51), so we use the stacking energy parameter
from the Turner rule (53). The above two coaxial stacks con-
tribute about 2.3 kcal/mol and 4.1 kcal/mol to the stability
of the pseudoknots at T ¼ 37C, respectively. In addition,
the PEMV and PLRV-S may be stabilized by the tertiary
interactions (12) such as (C.C-G for PEMV) and (C.G-C
for PLRV-S).
Pseudoknots with high binding affinity to the human immuno-
deficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1-RT). To
further test the model, as shown in Table 4, we predict the
native structures for 18 pseudoknot sequences [from Figure 2
in Ref. (59)] that have high binding affinity to HIV-1-RT as
selected by the SELEX experiments. We find that, except
for the sequence 2.9, our model can correctly predict the
native structures for all the rest 17 sequences (out of the
18 sequences). For sequence 2.9, our model predicts that an
alternative hairpin is more stable than the pseudoknot sug-
gested in the functional studies (59). The theory–experiment
difference for sequence 2.9 may come from other stabilizing
interactions, such as triple bases (18–20,29) that are neglected
in the current model.
Because of the use of the more physical entropy para-
meters, the present model gives more reliable predictions
for these sequences (30). If we delete the coaxial stacking
in our calculations, we find that the model predicts the same
structures as listed in Table 4 except for sequence 2.5a (entry

ribosomal frameshifting signal and the viral ribosomal readthrough signal

The calculations are performed at the standard conditions (1 M NaCl, 37

These sequences are truncated to keep the pseudoknot part. In the calculation,
we consider the coaxial stacking. The SE is defined as the ratio between the
number of the correctly predicted base pairs and the number of the base pairs
in the experimental determined structure, and the SP is defined as the ratio
between the number of the correctly predicted base pairs and the number of base
pairs in the predicted structure (54,55).

15 in Table 4), for which the predicted native structure
(without coaxial-stacking) has a poor (SE, SP) value of
(0.50, 0.50). This clearly demonstrated the importance of
the coaxial stacking in stabilizing the native pseudoknot for
sequence 2.5a.
In Tables 3 and 4, the SP parameters for some predicted
structures are not as good as SE. This is because these
sequences (such as IBV) have a long loop L2 across the
shallow groove, and our model predicts that some of the
nucleotides in the loops can form intra-loop base pairs.
These predicted intra-loop base pairs are not explicitly listed
in the experimentally measured structures, so the SP values
appear to be less optimal.
Pseudoknots PK1 and PK5–PK17. Pseudoknots are found to
be functionally active in viral RNAs (45) and ribosomal
RNAs (60). A systematic study for the thermodynamic
and structural properties of a specific type of short pseudo-
knots was reported in Refs. (6,52,61,62). These pseudoknots
are denoted as PKi (i ¼ 1, 5, 6, . . . , 17), where PK5-PK17
have the same helix stems but different loops. We here
focus on the pseudoknot-forming sequences PK1 and
PK5–17 [PK2–PK4 are hairpin-forming (61,62)]. Table 5
shows the results for the accuracies for our predicted native
structures for these 14 PKi pseudoknots. All the predicted
structures (PK1 and PK5–17) are in exact agreements with
the experiments.
Our stability calculation can provide useful evidence
for the existence/absence of coaxial stacking. For example,
without considering the coaxial stacking, our theory predicts
a stability of 4.2 kcal/mol for PK5. The predicted result
is quite close to the experimental results of 4.9 kcal/mol
(optical) or 4.3 kcal/mol (NMR) (62). Adding the coaxial
stacking energy 4.1 kcal/mol (50CC-GG30) (51) would over-
estimate the stability. So the PK5 pseudoknot is unlikely to
have the full coaxial stacking. On the other hand, the defi-
ciency in the stability without coaxial stacking suggests that
we cannot exclude the possibility of partial coaxial stacking
(52). For the PK1 pseudoknot, our predicted free energy with-
out coaxial stacking is 6.4 kcal/mol, which is close to the
experimental value (5.4 kcal/mol) (61). Adding the coaxial
stacking free energy of 3.0 kcal/mol (50CG-CG30) would
also over-estimate the stability. Therefore, the coaxial stack-
ing is unlikely to be formed in PK1. Though the predicted
results cannot exclude the possibility of partial coaxial stack-
ing, to simplify our calculation, we would not include the
coaxial stacking in our further folding thermodynamics
calculations for these sequences.
TYMV and TMV pseudoknots. The TYMV and TMV
sequences are parts of the tRNA-like structures in viral
RNAs (63–65). Their predicted native pseudoknots are
more complex than the simple H-pseudoknots discussed
above. As shown in Figures 5a and b, TYMV pseudoknot
consists of a closed secondary structure (C2-1) and a
H-pseudoknot (C3-1), and the TMV pseudoknot includes
three H-pseudoknot elements (C3  i, i ¼ 1, 2 and 3).
Shown in Figures 5a and b are the predicted native struc-
tures for the TYMV and TMV pseudoknots at T ¼ 37C.
The predicted structures agree exactly with the experimental
results both with and without considering the coaxial stacking
within each pseudoknot.
Other pseudoknots. In Figure 6, we show the predicted native
structures for other pseudoknot-forming sequences. The pre-
dicted structures agree exactly with the experimental mea-
sured ones, except for sequences PKWT and PKDC, which,
as shown in Figures 6f and g, each has two predicted struc-
tures. For both PKWT and PKDC, one of the two predicted
structures (structure II) agrees exactly with experiments
and the other predicted structure (structure I) is formed
through a single nucleotide sliding in the bulge of stem 2
in structure II.
In conclusion, nearly for all the 63 RNA pseudoknots that
we have tested, the model can give good predictions as
compared with experiments.

In the calculation, the coaxial stacking is not included. In the experiment, the
ion concentration is the mix 5 mM Mg2+ and 50 mM Na+, which may be close to
the 1 M NaCl condition used in the calculation. For each of the sequences
listed in the Table, we find a single transition in the calculated melting curve.

calculated the melting curves for PK1 and PK5–17 (totally
14) sequences (6,61,62), and other 8 pseudoknot-forming
sequences in Figure 6: T4–28, T4–32 and T4–35 (24,26),
G80 (23), mIAP (27), the pseudoknot domain of human
telomerase RNA (hTR) (PKWT) (28) and its two mutants
(PKDC and DU177) (29).
Table 5 shows the comparison between the predicted and
experimental melting temperatures for PK1 and PK5–17
sequences. The Table shows good theory–experiment agree-
ments. Since our pseudoknot stability calculation and the
theory–experiment comparison indicate that the coaxial-
stacking is unlikely to exist in these pseudoknots, we do
not include coaxial stacking in the melting curve calculation
for these sequences.
In Figure 6, we show the theory–experiment comparisons
for eight sequences. For these sequences, since the two heli-
cal stems can be coaxial or bent, we compute the melting
curves with and without coaxial stacking separately. As
shown in the Figure, for pseudoknots T4–28, T4–32 and
T4–35, the calculated melting curves with and without
coaxial stacking give similar results, and the curves without
coaxial stacking show slightly lower melting temperatures.
For the G80 and mIAP pseudoknots, however, the pre-
dicted results without the coaxial stacking give much better
agreement with the experiments, indicating that coaxial
stacking may not exist in these pseudoknots. The predicted
absence of coaxial stacking is in agreement with the experi-
ments (23,27), which suggest that the two stems are bent in
G80 and mIAP.
For PKWT and its mutants PKDC and DU177, the predictions
with coaxial stacking are better than those without coaxial
stacking, suggesting that coaxial stacking may play a role in
stabilizing PKWT and its mutant. Moreover, in the experiment
(28), the measured stability for the native structure of wild-
type at T ¼ 37C is 17.8 kcal/mol. Our model predicts
that, without coaxial stacking, the predicted PKWT structure
II in Figure 6f, which agrees exactly with the experimental
structure, has stability of DGII ¼ 12.3 kcal/mol, and struc-
ture I has stability DGI ¼13.2 kcal/mol. Adding the stability
3.9 kcal/mol for the coaxial stacking (50UC-GA30) would
give better agreement with the experiment.
Our theory–experiment agreements shown in Table 5 for
the melting temperatures and in Figure 6 for the melting
curves are not exact. A major problem is the ion effect.
Ions play important roles in RNA pseudoknot folding stabil-
ity (66,67). In our calculations, the enthalpic and entropic
parameters for the helix stems are for the 1 M NaCl condi-
tion. In the experiments, however, different concentrations
of Mg2+/Na+ or K+ mixture are used. For lower experimental
ion concentrations, such as 50 mM Na+ and 1.0 mM Mg2+ in
Figures 6a–c; 50 mM K+ for Figure 6e; 200 mM K+ for
Figures 6f and g; 200 mM Na+ for Figure 6h, the calculated
melting temperatures are higher than the experimental results
(See Figure 6). Nevertheless, our theory can predict not only
the native structures but also the structural transitions as
shown in the melting curves.
Coaxial stacking in pseudoknots
Pseudoknots, such as T4–28, T4–32, T4–35, G80 and mIAP
that are predicted not to form coaxial stacking all have a short
(mostly 1 nt) loop L1 across the deep groove. Short loops tend
to form rigid conformations due to the volume exclusion from
the helix stem. Such loop-helix interactions can strongly
restrict the configurations of the helix–helix connection,
such as coaxial stacking. For example, in the gene 32
mRNA pseudoknot of bacteriophage T2 (43), which has a
single-nucleotide loop L1, the helix–helix junction is over-
rotated compared to the continuous A-form helix, causing
the coaxial stacking impossible.
Longer flexible loops can make the formation of coaxial
stacking or partial coaxial stacking possible. For example,
pseudoknots PKWT, PKDC and D U177, which are predicted
to have coaxial stacking, all have larger loops. The PK5 pseu-
doknot, which has flexible loops L1 and L2 with lengths of
4 and 6-nt, respectively, can possibly form partial coaxial
stacking.
Free energy landscape and conformational switch
We introduce the free energy landscape to make a direct
structure-free energy connection. The free energy F(x) for a
macrostate is defined through a structural parameter (or a
parameter set) x. Such a macrostate is a collection of confor-
mations described by x. We choose x ¼ (n, nn) ¼ the number
of (native, nonnative) base pairs. Here a base pair is called
‘native’ if it exists in the native structure and ‘nonnative’
otherwise. The free energy landscape F(n, nn) can be
computed from the following conditional partition function
Q(n, nn):
Fðn‚nnÞ ¼ kBT ln Qðn‚nnÞ; QðxÞ ¼
X
confðxÞ
eE/kBT 11
where
X
confðxÞ
is the sum over all the possible conformations
with n native and nn nonnative base pairs, respectively. The
free energy landscape provides a full view for the stability of
all the conformations.
T4-derived pseudoknots. For the T4-derived pseudoknots
(T4–28, T4–32 and T4–35 in Figures 6a–c), the stability cal-
culation in the previous section shows that the predicted sta-
bility without coaxial stacking gives a better agreement with
the experiment. So we assume no coaxial stacking for the T4-
derived pseudoknots in the free energy landscape calculation.
The predicted structures, as shown in Figures 6a–c, agree
exactly with the NMR structures (24,26).
Shown in Figure 7 is the temperature-dependent of the free
energy landscape and the conformational transitions for T4–
35. The pseudoknotted native structure (N) of T4–35 is pre-
dicted to be the single predominant state at T ¼ 0C. As the
temperature is increased, stem 1 is partially unfolded at T ¼
70C and a resultant native-like hairpin (X) emerges and
coexist with the partially unfolded state (Z). At T ¼ 70C,
the intermediate states Z and X are equally stable. This sug-
gests that the first transition from the pseudoknot structure to
native-like hairpin X happens at about 70C, which is close to
the 67C transition temperature observed in the experiment
(26). As the temperature is further increased, stem 2 is dis-
rupted and the pseudoknot is fully unfolded. Since stem 2
is only slightly more stable than stem 1, the melting tempera-
tures for the breaking of stem 1 and of stem 2 are close to

each other, resulting in an apparent single peak in the melting
curve (Figure 6c).
Since the unfolding pathway of T4–35 RNA pseudoknot
involves the intermediate states (Z and X), a simple two-
state analysis for the experimental data would give inaccurate
results for the enthalpic and entropic parameters (24). In fact,
a simple two-state assumption may result in an under-
estimation for the folding enthalpy. For example, the experi-
ment gives a total folding enthalpy of about 100.7 kcal/mol
(26), but the simple two-state assumption gives a enthalpy
change of about 78 kcal/mol (24). From the nearest
neighbor interaction model (53), we find that the enthalpy
change without considering the coaxial stacking is equal to
93.5 kcal/mol, which is close to the 100.7 kcal/mol
experimental result (26). If we further consider the contribu-
tion of the unpaired terminal nucleotides (50CA-G50), which
has (DH, DS)¼ (9.0 kcal/mol,23.4 cal/mol/K) (53), our
predicted enthalpy would be 102.5 kcal/mol, which agrees
with the experimental result (100.7 kcal/mol) very well.
G80 and mIAP pseudoknots. For the G80 and mIAP
sequences, two well separated peaks are found in the melting
curves (see Figures 6d and e). Our free energy landscape cal-
culation shows that the first peak in the melting curve of G80
(mIAP) corresponds to the pseudoknot ! hairpin transition
through the disruption of pseudoknot stem 1 (stem 2), while
the second transition corresponds to the subsequent unwind-
ing of stem 2 (stem 1) in the hairpin; see Figures 8a and b for
the equilibrium unfolding pathways for the two sequences.
Experiments show that stem 1 melts before stem 2 for the
G80 sequence (23) and stem 2 is disrupted before stem
1 for the mIAP sequence (27). Our predicted pathways are
in accordance with the experimental findings. By comparing
the unfolding pathways for G80 and mIAP in Figure 8, we
find that the pseudoknot can unfold either through unzipping
from stem 1 (close to the 50 end) or from stem 2 (close to the
30 end).
Human telomerase RNA (hTR) PKWT and the PKDC and
DU177 mutants. For PKWT (28), our predicted structure II
shown in Figure 9 agrees with the experimentally proposed
structure (28), and the predicted structure I slightly differs
from II by a single-nucleotide shift for the A-U base pairs
in stem 2. The melting curve of PKWT (Figure 6f) shows a
major peak and a minor shoulder. Our free energy landscape
and structural calculations (see Figure 9a) show that the
major peak (at lower temperature) corresponds to the forma-
tion of two co-existing intermediates: a native-like hairpin
structure formed through the disruption of stem 2 and a mis-
folded hairpin through the complete rearrangement of the
base pairs. At T ¼ 80C, the native-like and the misfolded
hairpin intermediates co-exist. The minor shoulder at higher

temperature in the melting curve corresponds to the unfolding
of the hairpins (28). Our predictions are consistent with the
experiment (28), except that an additional minor transition
for the disruption of a triple base pairs (28,29) is observed
in experiment. Such additional transition is absent in our
prediction because the theory does not treat triple base pairs.
As shown in Figure 9, the folding/unfolding of PKWT
involves the native-like hairpin intermediate. The pseudoknot
! native-like hairpin switch is found to be functionally
important in human telomerase RNA (hTR) (28,68,69). The
predicted native-like hairpin in Figure 9 is in accordance
with the experimentally proposed structure, except that the
experimentally proposed hairpin contains tandem base pairs
(28,68). The tandem base pairs are not treated in the present
form of our model. Experimental mutational studies show
that these tandem mismatches have only minor contributions
to the hTR function (70).
Our predicted misfolded hairpin in the folding/unfolding of
PKWT may also be important for function. Phylogenetic anal-
ysis shows that the nucleotides 50 107G-111C 30 and 50 115U-
119C 30 in the helix stem of the predicted misfolded hairpin
intermediate are highly conserved (>80%) in the published
vertebrate telomerase RNA sequences (71). The conserved
nucleotides suggest that the misfolded hairpin may serve as
the other (hairpin) candidate for the functionally important
pseudoknot! hairpin conformational switch. For the PKDC
mutant, the 107GC! AG mutation would disrupt the most
stable base stacking (50GC-GC30) in stem 2 of the wild-
type (PKWT) and thus destabilize stem 2. As a result, the
mutation would cause a decrease in the melting temperature
for the disruption of stem 2 (¼ the first transition in the
unfolding process); see Figure 6f for the wild-type PKWT
and Figure 6g for the mutant PKDC. In addition, the mutation
significantly destabilizes the misfolded hairpin intermediate
(see Figure 9a at T = 80C) that emerges in the unfolding pro-
cess of PKWT. As a result, the misfolded hairpin is absent in
the unfolding process of PKDC.
In contrast, for DU177, the deletion of U177 eliminates the
1 nt bulge loop in the (wild-type) stem 2 and thus stabilizes
stem 2, which would cause an increase in the transition tem-
perature for the melting of stem 2; see also the melting curves
in Figures 6f and h. The prediction agrees with the experi-
ment (29). From the above results for the mutants, we find
that the two mutants (107GC! AG and DU177) cause sig-
nificant changes in the pseudoknot stability. Such changes
have been suggested to cause human telomerase diseases
(28,29,68,72,73).

is found to be functionally important. Mutants that disrupt the
pseudoknot structure are found to cause low telomerase activ-
ity (74). We use the sequences in Figure 1b of Ref. (74) for
the predictions. Calculations with and without the coaxial
stacking give the same native structures; see Figure 10. Our
model predicts that the 71–72G, 84–85C and 84–87C muta-
tions will completely disrupt the pseudoknot structure,
and the two compensatory mutations, Comp 1 (71–72G and
84–85C) and Comp 2 (84–87C and 71–74G) can restore the
wild-type pseudoknot structure. These predictions are consis-
tent with the experimental results (74). Moreover, the exp-
eriments (74) show that the mutants (71–72G, 84–85C and
84–87C) can reduce the telomerase activity to a very low
level, which shows that a stable pseudoknot structure is cru-
cial for the functional activity of the telomerase RNA (74,75).
CONCLUSION
Predicting the folding thermodynamics for RNA pseudoknots
has been greatly hampered by the lacking of a physical model
that can give accurate thermodynamic parameters (especially
loop entropy parameters). In the present study, we develop a
polymer statistical mechanical model to compute the con-
formational entropy from first principle. From the rigorous
polymer chain conformational count, we derive a set of
pseudoknot loop entropy parameters, from which we can
compute the pseudoknot partition function and the free
energy landscapes and the folding thermodynamics for
RNA pseudoknots. Experimental tests for the predicted native
structures and the thermal melting curves for a wide range
of different pseudoknots show that the model is reliable.
Furthermore, from the free energy landscapes and the base
pairing probabilities, we predict the equilibrium folding path-
ways, folding stabilities for RNA pseudoknots. We find that
the T4-pseudoknots, the mIAP and the G80 pseudoknots
unfold though sequential disruptions of the helix stems with-
out the formation of nonnative intermediates, while the pseu-
doknot domain of the hTR unfolds through the formation of
the native-like and misfolded hairpin intermediates. These
folding intermediates are found to be functionally important
and mutations that alter the stabilities of these intermediates
can cause disease.

APPENDIX
RNA secondary structure partition function
Closed conformations. For RNA secondary structures without
pseudoknots, the hierarchical relationship of the secondary
structure results in the following recursive relation for the
partition functions (42); see also Figures 4b and c:
C2ða  1‚bþ 1Þ ¼ ðeDGstack/kBTÞfC2ða‚bÞ þ eDSunstackedðba1Þ/kB
þ
X
t‚ l
eDSunstackedðlÞ/kB Ot2ða‚b‚ lÞg 12
where DGstack is the free energy of the closing stack formed by
the base pairs (a, b) and (a  1, b + 1)in Figure 4b, and
DSunstacked(l) is the entropy for a type-t loop of length l (see
the central large loop in Figure 4b). C2(x, y) denotes the par-
tition function of the closed conformations from nucleotide x
to nucleotide y, Ot2ða‚b‚ lÞ denotes the partition function of the
type-t open conformations (t ¼ L, M, R, LR) from nucleotide a
to nucleotide b shown in Figure 4a.
Open conformations. For RNA secondary structures,
Ot2ða‚b‚ lÞ can be conveniently calculated recursively from
the partition functions for shorter chains (42).

To illustrate the meaning of the above equations, as an
example, in Figure 4e we show a diagrammatic illustration
for Equation 14.
From Equations 12 and 13–16, the recursive relations for
the partition functions for the closed and the open conforma-
tions are inter-related. The computation based on the above
recursive relations can efficiently give the partition function
for any chain segment from a to b:
C2ða‚bÞ ¼ the partition function for the closed conformations :
Ot2ða‚bÞ ¼
X
l
Ot2ða‚b‚ lÞ
¼ the partition function for the open conformations
