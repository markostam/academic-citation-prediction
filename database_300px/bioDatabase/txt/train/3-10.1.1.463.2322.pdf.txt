Abstract 
 
Inhalable particles (PM10) in Lahore, Pakistan, during a high polluting spring episode in 2006 were 
collected and analyzed for the ambient concentrations of organic and element carbon (OC, EC) and 
more than one hundred organic species. High PM10 mass concentrations, averaging 459 µg/m3, were 
characterized by extremely high concentrations of mobile source related organic compounds including 
hopanes and PAHs. Source apportionment of PM10 OC, EC and mass was performed using molecular 
marker based CMB receptor model. Results showed that traffic pollution, including exhaust from 
gasoline or diesel powered vehicles, was the predominate source of carbonaceous aerosols. Gasoline 
powered vehicles plus diesel exhausts contribute 47.5%, 88.3% and 15.4% of measured inhalable 
particulate OC, EC and mass, respectively. Though the contribution is not quantitatively calculated in 
this study, dust was estimated as another important source of PM10, which is a significant contributor 
to coarse phase pollutions. Even compared to other mega-cities like Beijing, Mexico City, and Los 
Angeles, the motor vehicle associated pollution in Lahore was found to be very large. Other sources of 
carbonaceous aerosols were quantified including wood smoke, vegetative detritus, natural gas 
combustions and have relative small contributions compared with the traffic pollutions.

INTRODUCTION Environmental pollution is a serious problem 
in many developing countries especially for 
those in the process of rapid industrialization, 
urbanization with increasing populations. As 
the second largest city of Pakistan, Lahore (Lat: 
31°35'N, Long: 74°20'E) is plagued with high 
concentrations of atmospheric pollutants

including lead, calcium, zinc, carbon monoxide, 
ozone, as well as many other hazardous 
pollutants that impact human health and welfare 
(Smith et al., 1996; Younas et al., 1998; 
Rattigan et al., 2002; Waheed et al., 2006; 
Ghauri et al., 2007). Consequently, according 
to the World Bank (WorldBank, 2006), 
environmental degradation costs Pakistan at 
least 6 percent of GDP, in which illness and 
premature mortality caused by air pollution 
(indoor and outdoor) occupied almost half of 
the total damage cost. 
In the previous research, inorganic matters 
such as ions and metal elements in total 
suspended particulates (TSP) have been 
measured in Lahore (Smith et al., 1996; 
Harrison et al., 1997; Rattigan et al., 2002). 
Their ambient concentrations, sources and 
impacts have been studied in the 1990s (Smith 
et al., 1996; Harrison et al., 1997). Metals, ions, 
black carbon and organic carbon, etc., were 
measured and used for source tracking. Results 
showed that almost all particulate matters 
pollutants of concern have extremely high 
yearly concentrations, including lead (3.92 ± 
4.46 μg/m3), OC (76.9 ± 39.1 μg/m3) and TSP 
(607 ± 403 μg/m3) measured in 1992-1993 
(Smith et al., 1996). Soil dust, coal 
combustions, vehicular exhausts and 
metallurgical processes were regarded as the 
main sources of the inorganic species (Harrison 
et al., 1997; Younas et al., 1998; Ghauri et al., 
2007). Limited organic compounds, mostly 
particle-associated polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also measured at 
high concentrations around one order of 
magnitude higher than that in some European 
cities (e.g., Birmingham, UK) (Smith et al., 
1995; Smith et al., 1996). However, to our 
knowledge, pollution levels of many other 
speciated organic compounds have never been 
reported in Pakistan, nor has their sources been 
assessed. Carbonaceous particulate matters are 
usually large contributors to particulate mass 
and play important roles in human health, air 
quality and climate processes (Jacobson, 2002; 
Quinn et al., 2005; Tabazadeh, 2005). 
Speciated organic compounds data can provide 
more source information than inorganic species 
(Schauer et al., 1996; Cass, 1998). In the 
present study, daily urban inhalable particulate 
matters was collected and analyzed during a 
high pollution spring episode in 2006. Although 
little has been reported about the seasonality of 
particulate matter concentrations and sources in 
Lahore, the spring season was chosen to 
represent a typical period of pollution avoiding 
the extreme periods of winter, summer and the 
monsoons. Speciated organic compounds were 
quantified and their source contributions were 
evaluated using organic compounds as tracers 
in a chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor 
model. The results provide insight into PM10 air 
quality pollutants of Lahore, Pakistan and can 
be used as a foundation to design future air 
quality mitigation strategies relating to 
management of the air pollution in Lahore, 
Pakistan. This goal of this manuscript is to 
demonstrate the feasibility and utility of 
molecular marker source apportionment studies 
in developing nations with significant 
atmospheric particulate matter pollution and 
very limited measurement based information on 
the sources of the particulate matter pollution.

Chemical analysis As demonstrated in the current study, routine 
sampling efforts with a well designed chemical 
analysis strategy can provide significant insight 
into understanding the source of particulate 
matter, which can be used to design future 
monitoring, modelling and control strategy 
studies. Future projects of this nature should be 
pursued as collaborations between researchers 
in developing nations and international research 
groups to address sources of PM in developing 
nations with significant particulate matter 
pollution. 
 
METHODS 
 
Sampling 
Daily atmospheric samples of PM10 were 
collected with a High Volume PM10 sampler 
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) in Lahore 
from March 13th to April 16th in the spring of 
2006. The sampler was located on a 10 meter 
high building at the University of Engineering 
and Technology in the urban centre of Lahore. 
Samples were collected on quartz fibre filters, 
which were baked at a temperature of 550oC 
before samplings, and delivered to the sampling 
sites individually wrapped in baked aluminium 
foil and double packed in zip-lock bags. After 
sampling, the filters were re-wrapped in baked 
aluminium foil, double packed in zip-lock bags 
and stored in a low temperature (< 0oC) 
thermal-isolated box. For the purposes of 
QA/QC, blank samples were obtained by 
placing the filter in the sample with no air 
passing across the filter. 
All of the samples were analyzed for water 
soluble metals, ions, organic carbon, as well as 
thermal-optical analyzed organic and element 
carbon. Results of water soluble ions and metal 
elements are not presented in the present paper. 
Eight daily samples from April 2nd through 10th 
were analyzed for speciated organic compounds 
by GC-MS method. 
Water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) was 
quantified based on the modified method 
introduced in the previous studies (Wangersky, 
1993). Particles on quartz filters were extracted 
by high purity MQ water in capped vials on a 
shaker table for 6 hours, then the solution were 
filtered through 0.2 µm polypropylene filters. 
Excess HCl was then added into the solution 
and purged to remove inorganic carbon. Finally, 
non-purgeable organic carbon was catalytically 
combusted to carbon dioxide and determined by 
NDIR detector thus the quantity of WSOC was 
obtained. 
The detailed analysis process of organic 
compounds quantification by GC-MS could be 
found in many previous publications (Sheesley 
et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 
2007b). Briefly, before extraction, filters were 
spiked with known quantities of labelled 
internal standards then extracted twice with 
methanol and three times with dichloromethane 
in thick wall bottles using a mild ultrasonic bath 
maintained at room temperature. The combined 
extracts were filtered and concentrated with 
vacuum evaporation and blow-down using ultra 
purified nitrogen. The final extract was split 
into several fractions and analyzed by GC-MS 
after methylation and silylation. Multipoint

calibration was employed using authentic 
standards spiked with the same final 
concentrations of internal standards as used in 
the samples. The authentic quantification 
standards included more than 150 organic 
compounds such as alkanes, alkanoic and 
aromatic acids, PAH, anhydrosaccharides, 
steranes and steroids, etc. Compounds without 
authentic standards were quantified based on 
the calibration curves of the similar species 
(Sheesley et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2005; 
Zhang et al., 2007b). In this study, the 
uncertainty of organic compound quantification 
was estimated to be 20% of the reported values. 
 
Source apportionment model 
Source apportionment was conducted by the 
USEPA chemical mass balance software 
(CMB8.2) using organic compounds as tracers 
which was developed by Schauer et al. and 
refined by Schauer and Cass (Schauer et al., 
1996; Schauer and Cass, 2000) from the middle 
of 1990s. The molecular marker based CMB 
model has been successfully used in many 
regions including Los Angeles, Houston, south 
eastern United States, Hong Kong and Beijing, 
etc. (Schauer et al., 1996; Zheng et al., 2000; 
Zheng et al., 2002; Fraser et al., 2003). 
Principle of CMB model was based on the 
assumption that the airborne particle 
concentrations were physically determined by 
the linear combination of different sources. 
Diagnostics of the CMB model include 
explained percent mass (target 100 ± 20%), R2 
(target 0.8-1.0), χ2 (target 0-4.0), T-STAT 
(Target > 2.0), degree of freedom (DF, target > 
5), no co-linearity clusters, and calculated-to-
measured ratio (C/M ratio for fitting species, 
target 0.5-2.0) (Zheng et al., 2002). Selections 
of the source profiles and fitting species in this 
study were based on the previous studies 
(Schauer et al., 1996; Cass, 1998; Schauer et al., 
2002a; Zheng et al., 2002). The source profiles 
applied in this study, which are listed in Table 1, 
are based on previously estimates of the main 
sources of carbonaceous aerosol in South Asia 
urban locations and were obtained from the 
literatures including vegetative detritus (Rogge 
et al., 1993b), wood smoke (Fine et al., 2004), 
natural gas combustion (Rogge et al., 1993c), 
diesel exhaust (Schauer et al., 1999), gasoline 
powered vehicle exhaust (Schauer et al., 2002b) 
and coal combustion emissions (Zhang et al., 
2007a). It should be noted that the applied 
source profiles used in the analysis were not 
specific to Lahore but previous work has shown 
that the composition source profiles do not 
change greatly in different regions of the world 
(Sheesley et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007a). 
The source profile used for gasoline-powered 
vehicles was a non-catalyst emission profile, 
since the vehicles plying in Lahore are 
predominantly non-catalytic, including high 
emitting 2 stroke motorcycles and 3 wheelers. 
Most of the source profiles were measured in 
the US except the coal combustions tested in 
China. In addition, all of the source profiles 
were fine particulate matter emissions profiles, 
which are effectively PM10 profiles due to the 
fact that that the organic compounds of the 
carbonaceous emissions of combustion sources 
were dominated by fine particulate fraction 
especially for combustion sources (Kleeman 
and Cass, 1998; Kleeman et al., 1999, 2000).

The fitting species, including n-alkanes, PAH, 
hopanes and steranes, levoglucosan and EC, 
were selected based on prior experience with 
the use of these tracers in source apportionment 
calculations (Cass, 1998; Simoneit et al., 1999). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Bulk compositions of PM10 
Concentrations of PM10 during the sampling 
period were showed in Fig. 1 including EC, 
organic mass (OM), and water soluble ions. 
Organic mass is estimated from the 
measurement of organic carbon (OC) and 
assuming that the sum of hydrogen, oxygen and 
nitrogen in organic compounds are 80 percent 
of the organic carbon mass (Turpin and Lim, 
2001; Bae et al., 2006).  The largest fraction of 
PM10 was organic mass, which is often 
dominated by emissions from combustion 
processes such as vehicle exhausts, fossil fuel 
combustions and biomass burnings (Schauer et 
al., 1996; Zheng et al., 2002) and secondary 
organic aerosol (SOA). OM was split into two 
parts: water soluble and insoluble. The mass 
concentration of PM10 ranged from 158 to 733 
µg/m3 with the average concentration of 361 
µg/m3. Comparatively, the pollution level of 
this study was much higher than the WHO 24-h 
mean air quality guideline of 50 µg/m3, even 
higher than the previous measurement in 
Lahore by Ghauri et al. (2007), averagely 200 
µg/m3 during 2003 to 2004, showing the 
tendency toward increased PM10 pollution 
during the past 2 or 3 years. WSOC in 
atmospheric particulate matter is largely from 
polar organic compounds with small molecular 
weights such as acids, alkanols,

 levoglucosan and some sterols.  The two 
dominant sources of WSOC in most locations 
are secondary organic aerosols (SOA) or 
biomass burnings. In this study, concentrations 
of WSOC averaged 8.46 µg/m3, approximately 
18% of total organic carbon. Though the 
concentration of WSOC in Lahore is higher 
than some other cities such as Hong Kong (Ho 
et al., 2006), the WSOC/OC ratios in this study 
are relatively lower than some other cities with 
WSOC/OC of about 30% (Grosjean et al., 1978; 
Rogge et al., 1993d; Stone et al., 2007). Ratio 
of EC/OC in this study is averagely 0.28, 
similar to that of a previous measurement in 
Lahore, which averaged 0.22 (Smith et al., 
1996).

Quantified organic matter 
More than one hundred organic compounds 
were quantitatively analyzed including n-
alkanes, PAH, sterols, hopanes and steranes, etc. 
During the study period, concentrations of the 
total quantified organic compounds had large 
variability spanning from 300-6200 ng/m3. 
Large fractions of unresolved complex mixture 
(UCM) were detected and showed in Fig. 2(a). 
UCM was a hump in the GC generated by 
complex mixed branched and cyclic 
hydrocarbons which are typically associated 
with contribution from fossil fuel residue 
(Simoneit, 1986; Rogge et al., 1993d). In this 
study, the UCM concentrations ranged from 
7.3-190 ng/m3, occupied 17-96% of the total 
organic matters, which provides evidence of 
large contributions from fossil fuel combustions. 
Concentrations of the quantified organic 
compounds are shown in Fig. 2(b) by 
compound class. Fatty acids were not reported 
in this study due to analytical problems 
resulting in very high uncertainties. The largest 
fractions were n-alkanes and levoglucosan, 
which averaged about 27% and 9% of the total 
quantified organic mass, respectively. The other 
important contributors to organic mass were 
dicarboxylic acids and aromatic polyacids, 
hopanes and steranes, as well as some other 
species with relatively low concentrations such 
as glycerides, sterols and PAHs. 
Compared to other reported concentrations of 
levoglucosan in urban locations, such as 
Beijing (473 ng/m3), Bakersfield ( > 1000 
ng/m3), Houston (5-98 ng/m3) and Gent Brazil 
(19-477 ng/m3) (Schauer and Cass, 2000; 
Fraser et al., 2002; Nolte et al., 2002; Zdrahal 
et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2005), atmospheric 
concentrations of levoglucosan in Lahore were 
relatively moderate as seen in Fig. 2(b).  The 
Lahore ambient concentrations of levoglucosan, 
which is a tracer for biomass burning (Simoneit 
et al., 1999) indicates that biomass burning is 
not the predominate source in Lahore.  
Hopanes and steranes in the atmosphere are 
from fossil fuel combustions, including vehicle 
exhaust and coal combustions, and their 
distribution can be used as an indicator for 
different fossil fuel sources (Rogge et al., 
1993a; Schauer et al., 1999; Oros and Simoneit, 
2000; Schauer et al., 2002b). Concentrations of 
hopanes in Lahore showed dramatically high 
level reaching a total concentration of 
quantified hopanes on April 6th of 363 ng/m3.  
Even the lowest concentration during the study 
period on April 10th was 10 ng/m3, which is 
significantly higher than many very polluted 
cities including cities in the south eastern US 
(0.4-2.2 ng/m3), Houston (1.6-2.1 ng/m3) and 
Beijing (10.7 ng/m3) (Fraser et al., 2002; Zheng 
et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2005), which 
indicates a very large contribution from fossil 
fuel combustion in Lahore.  The daily pattern in 
hopane concentrations are shown in Fig. 3(a). 
PAH are present in refined fossil fuels and 
are the byproducts of incomplete combustions 
of carbon based fuels.  Benzo[ghi]perylene 
(BgP) and coronene (COR) are reasonable 
specific source tracers for gasoline powered 
vehicles and picene (PIC) is unique tracer of 
coal burnings (Oros and Simoneit, 2000; Zhang 
et al., 2008). Average concentrations of BgP 
(8.3 ng/m3) and COR (4.1 ng/m3) were present 
in very high levels in Lahore, which suggests

that fossil fuel associated source contributions 
to particulate matter concentrations were 
dominated by vehicular exhaust during the 
study period. A previous study in Lahore 
measured a higher concentration of 14.64 and 
5.40 ng/m3 for BgP and COR, respectively 
(Smith et al., 1996). Concentrations of picene 
in this study averaged 0.7 ng/m3, which is in the 
range of concentrations measured in Beijing in 
spring, 0.47 ng/m3, and concentrations 
measured in Beijing in the in winter, 1.34 ng/m3. 
Coal combustion is an important source of PAH 
in Beijing in winter months (Zheng et al., 2005), 
suggesting that coal combustion is a significant 
source of PAH in Lahore.  Fig. 3(b) presents 
the daily trend in select PAH concentrations. 
 
Source apportionment results of OC and EC 
Source apportionment model results for OC 
and EC are presented in Fig. 4 and Table 2. 
Model diagnostic results yielded average R2 
and χ2, of 0.79 ± 0.07 and 4.89 ± 1.58, 
respectively. The average C/M ratio of fitting 
species was 0.92 ± 0.44 (mean ± stdev, n = 159).

The explained OC percentage is 60.2 ± 
14.6% (mean ± stdev, n = 8) ranged from 34.6-
77.2%, which is typical for a molecular marker 
CMB model that is used to apportion PM10 and 
does not include resuspended soil. Six sources 
were quantified in the molecular marker CMB 
model including vegetative detritus, wood 
smoke, natural gas combustion, diesel, gasoline 
139 
Zhang et al., Aerosol and Air Quality Research, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 130-146, 2008 
 
vehicle exhaust and coal combustions. Among 
all the explained sources, gasoline powered 
vehicle exhaust was the largest contributor 
accounting for 29.5 ± 16.0% of the measured 
OC. Very high contributions from gasoline 
vehicles were observed as noted above, which 
is consistent with previous studies (Harrison et 
al., 1997; Rattigan et al., 2002; Ghauri et al., 
2007). The second largest source contribution 
was also associated with traffic and was diesel 
exhaust, with an average contribution of 18.1 ± 
5.0% of the measured OC. The two combined 
traffic sources accounted for approximately half 
of the measured OC concentrations (47.5 ± 
13.5%). This is a common characteristic for 
many mega-cities with large vehicular 
populations, such as Los Angeles, Beijing and 
Mexico City, where vehicular exhausts are also 
the largest OC sources, contributing about 50%, 
20% and 50% of ambient OC, respectively 
(Schauer et al., 1996; Zheng et al., 2005; Stone 
et al., 2007). 
Comparatively, other sources contribute 
relatively small fractions of the organic 
carbonaceous concentration. Biomass burning 
and vegetative detritus have the largest 
contributions after traffic sources with 
contributions of 5.0 ± 2.8% and 5.8 ± 1.5% of 
the OC, respectively. In this study, biomass 
burning is expected to be due to the observed 
garbage combustions in Lahore including 
leaves, branches, mowed grass, as well as 
papers, plastic bags, etc. Coal and natural gas 
combustions were also quantified but have even 
small contributions to PM10 OC concentrations.  
Natural gas combustion have smaller emission 
factors than coal stoves (Rogge et al., 1993c,

1997; Oros and Simoneit, 2000), though 
residential fuel in Lahore is mostly natural gas, 
their contribution to OC was quite small. 
However, coal and natural gas combustions 
were important sources of PAHs and oxy-PAHs 
(Rogge et al., 1993c). The large fractions of un-
apportioned “Other sources” OC ranged from 
23-65%, which is expected to be dominated 
sources excluded from the model including 
secondary organic aerosol (SOA), industrial 
point sources, and organic matters in 
resuspended dust. The measured WSOC can be 
used to better assess the likelihood of these 
different sources contributing the 
unapportioned OC concentrations.  WSOC is 
largely from SOA and biomass smoke (Stone et 
al., 2007).  In this study, WSOC for the sample 
is much lower than CMB un-apportioned OC, 
which means that the “Other sources” of 
organic cannot be explained by SOA, and is 
likely due to other sources not included in the 
model such as resuspended soil. 
Source apportionment results of EC (Fig. 4b) 
were calculated according to the different 
source profile OC/EC ratios. The predominant 
source of the PM10 EC was diesel exhaust, 
which occupy 86.4 ± 9.8% of the total 
measured EC.  The present results are twice as 
large as a previous study in Lahore conducted 
more than ten years ago, which apportioned 7.6 
± 2.5 μg/m3 TSP EC to vehicular sources 
(Harrison et al., 1997). Other sources 
contributing EC include residential coal 
combustion, wood burning and natural gas

combustion.  Harrison et al. (1997) reported a 
much higher impact of coal combustion on EC 
concentrations in Lahore more than ten years 
ago, which accounted for 32 ± 16% of total EC 
in TSP. The previous result is much larger than 
the current study, which may reflect changes in 
emissions over the past 10 years. 
 
Source apportionment results of PM10 mass 
Source contributions of PM10 mass (Fig. 5) 
were calculated according to the OC/PM10 
ratios of different sources. Secondary water 
soluble ions were also included in Fig. 5 to 
show their contribution to PM10 concentration.  
The largest fraction is the unknown “Other 
sources” part ranged from 68-89% of total 
PM10 mass, larger than that of the “Other 
sources” in OC apportionment. According to 
the previous measurement, soil occupy 62 ± 3% 
TSP (Harrison et al., 1997), similar to the PM10 
mass “Other sources” percentages of the 
present result. Therefore, the large unknown 
PM10 mass is expected to be from resuspended 
soil and/or dust. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Air pollution is a serious problem in Lahore, 
Pakistan, which is usually characterized with 
high ambient concentrations of particulate 
pollutants. Mass concentration of inhalable 
particles (PM10) observed in a high polluting 
spring episode in 2006 also showed an 
extremely high level with the average 
concentration exceeds 450 μg/m3. Source 
apportionment by the CMB receptor model 
using speciated organic compounds as tracers 
demonstrates the key sources for PM10 organic 
carbon, element carbon and mass. Mobile 
sources, both gasoline and diesel powered 
vehicle emissions are the significant PM10 
sources which contribute 47.5% OC, 88.3% EC 
and 15.4% mass of inhalable particles, 
respectively. Besides, vehicle associated dust 
source was estimated as another important 
contributor of coarse phase PM10 pollutants. 
Comparatively, other sources quantified during 
this polluting episode have relatively small 
contributions, including wood smoke, 
vegetative detritus, natural gas and coal 
combustions, etc.
