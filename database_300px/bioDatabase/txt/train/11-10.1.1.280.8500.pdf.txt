ABSTRACT
The E2F family of transcription factors are down-
stream effectors of the retinoblastoma protein, pRB,
pathway and are essential for the timely regulation of
genes necessary for cell-cycle progression. Here we
describe the characterization of human and murine
E2F8, a new member of the E2F family. Sequence ana-
lysis of E2F8 predicts the presence of two distinct
E2F-related DNA binding domains suggesting that
E2F8 and, the recently, identified E2F7 form a sub-
group within the E2F family. We show that E2F tran-
scription factors bind the E2F8 promoter in vivo and
that expression of E2F8 is being induced at the G1/S
transition. Purified recombinant E2F8 binds spe-
cifically to a consensus E2F-DNA-binding site indic-
ating that E2F8, like E2F7, binds DNA without the
requirement of co-factors such as DP1. E2F8 inhibits
E2F-driven promoters suggesting that E2F8 is tran-
scriptional repressor like E2F7. Ectopic expression of
E2F8 indiploidhumanfibroblastsreducesexpression
of E2F-target genes and inhibits cell growth consist-
ent with a role for repressing E2F transcriptional activ-
ity. Taken together, these data suggest that E2F8
has an important role in turning of the expression
of E2F-target genes in the S-phase of the cell cycle.
INTRODUCTION
The E2F family of transcription factors are downstream effect-
ors of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway and are
essential for orchestrating the timely expression of a large
number of genes required for cell-cycle progression and
proliferation (1,2). In the majority of human cancers, the
control of E2F transcriptional regulation is deregulated and
is caused either by direct mutational inactivation of the RB1
gene or through aberrant expression of genes regulating
pRB (3).
In G0/G1 of the cell cycle, the transcriptional activities of
the E2Fs are restrained by members of pRB family, pRB, p107
and p130, and this suppression is dependent on the ability of
these proteins to sequester and thereby repress E2F activity
(4). Several lines of evidence have shown that E2Fs are
required for S-phase entry (5,6). Overexpression of E2F is
sufficient to induce quiescent cells to enter S-phase (6) and,
more recently, it was demonstrated that E2F1-3 triple knock-
out cells are defective for S-phase entry (7). Furthermore, in
Rb/ mouse embryo fibroblasts the G1 phase is shorter than
in wild-type cells.
Cell-cycle progression is driven by mitogenic growth sig-
nals, which result in the synthesis and accumulation of D-type
cyclins. Associated cyclin-dependent kinases initiate the phos-
phorylation of the pRB family members, dissociating them
from the E2F transcription factors. As a result, an auto-
regulatory amplification loop of transcription is activated at
the late G1/early S-phase of the cell-cycle resulting in
increased transcriptional activity of E2F family members,
which in turn activates the expression of a large number of
genes involved in cell-cycle progression, proliferation and
DNA replication (2). The transcriptional activity of the
E2Fs oscillates through the cell cycle and to terminate and
exit S-phase a decrease in E2F activity is required (8).
Mammalian cells express at least seven members of the E2F
family (E2F1–7). In addition, several E2F isoforms are gen-
erated by alternative splicing for some of the E2F family
members adding another layer of complexity to the functions
of E2Fs (6). The E2F family can be divided into four
subgroups on the basis of their structure, affinity for members
of the pRB family, complex formation with members of the

DP family, transcriptional function and expression pattern.
E2F1–6 are characterized by the presence of two highly con-
served domains necessary for sequence specific DNA binding
and dimerization with DP proteins, respectively. E2F1–3a are
considered to be transcriptional activators and, when overex-
pressed, can drive quiescent cells into S-phase (6). Their tran-
scriptional repertoires are exclusively controlled by pRB and
E2F1–3a expression is induced at the G1/S-phase of the cell
cycle and directs the expression E2F-regulated genes. In con-
trast, E2F3b, E2F4 and E2F5 occupy E2F-regulated promoters
in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and interact with all three
pRB family members, which repress transcription by recruit-
ment of chromatin-remodelling complexes, histone- and DNA-
modifying enzymes such HDAC and DNA methyltransferases
(6). E2F4 and E2F5 lack nuclear localization signals and are
excluded from the cell nucleus during S-phase, but relocalizes
to the nucleus after complex formation with the pocket pro-
teins (6). The third group is represented by E2F6, which is also
a repressor of transcription that forms a structurally and func-
tionally separate group within the E2F family. E2F6 lacks a
transcriptional activation domain and sequences necessary for
complex formation with members of the pRB family. Instead,
E2F6 represses transcription through interactions with the
Polycomb group of proteins (6). The exact role of E2F6 in
transcriptional regulation is presently unclear, but recent data
suggest that E2F6 specifically down-regulates E2F-target
genes activated at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (9).
E2F6 also appears to play a role in development and differ-
entiation. Accordingly, a mild homeotic phenotype has been
reported for E2F6/ knockout mice (10). Recently, E2F7, a
novel member of the E2F family was identified (11–13). E2F7
is structurally unique in that it harbours a tandem repeat of E2F
DNA-binding domains. Furthermore E2F7 interacts with
DNA independently of DP proteins. E2F7b expression is
restricted to the S-phase of the cell cycle and has been
shown to repress a subset of E2F-regulated genes.
Here we describe the identification of a novel member of the
E2F family, E2F8. E2F8 shows a high degree of resemblance
to E2F7 and shares the unique structure of E2F7 by having two
distinct domains exhibiting a high degree of similarity to the
DNA-binding domain of the E2F family. We show that E2F8
expression is cell-cycle regulated and is activated by E2Fs at
G1/early S-phase of the cell cycle and that members of the E2F
family occupy the E2F8 promoter in vivo. E2F8 binds con-
sensus E2F sites in a DP-independent manner and represses
transcription of E2F-regulated promoters. Ectopic expression
of E2F8 inhibits cellular proliferation. Altogether, the restric-
ted expression and repressive transcriptional function of E2F8
suggests a role for E2F8 in negative feedback loop repressing
E2F-activated promoters. Our results extend and are consistent
with two recent reports on the identification of mouse and
human E2F8 (14,15), published while this manuscript was
in preparation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids
The promoter reporter constructs encoding various promoters
fused to the luciferase reporter gene and expression constructs
used for transcriptional assays pGL3-6xE2F, pGL3-E2F1,
pGL3-CDC6, pGL3-CyclinE1, pGAL-luc, pCMV-E2F1 and
pCMV-E2F7, respectively, have been described previously
(12,22,23).
cDNA cloning of human and murine E2F8
The putative open reading frames (ORFs) of human and mur-
ine E2F8 were amplified by PCR from HeLa cDNA and a
ProQuest Mouse Embryo (day 8.5) cDNA library from Invit-
rogen (Carlsbad, CA), respectively, using primers: 50–30 and
50–30. PCR products were gel purified and cloned into pCR2.1-
TOPO (InVitrogen). Three clones were sequenced on both
strands to generate a consensus sequence. To generate expres-
sion vectors, hE2F8 was subcloned into the EcoRI site of
pEntr3C, and mE2F8 was transferred into pDONR221.
These are both Gateway compatible vectors (Invitrogen).
Using these entry clones E2F8 was transferred into pCMV,
pCMV-Ha, pCMV-myc and pBabepuro. A double mutant in
the conserved DNA-binding domain of hE2F8 changing
amino acids 118–119 from leucine-glycine to glutamate-
phenylalanine was generated in pEntr3C using a standard
mutagenesis method.
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was purified from U2OS and HeLaS3 cells using
RNAeasy (Qiagen, West Sussex). Total RNA (2 mg) was
reverse transcribed using a TaqMan reverse transcription
reagents from ABI (NJ) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For RNA quantification, 150 ng of reversed
transcribed total RNA were analysed by real-time PCR
using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and an ABI prism
7700 Sequence Detection system. All reactions were analysed
in triplicates. Primer sequences for human E2F8, E2F7,
b-actin, Cyclin E1, Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 are available
upon request.
Tissue culture
HeLaS3 and U20S were grown at 37C in 5% CO2. HeLaS3
cells were arrested in S-phase by a double thymidine block as
has been described previously (24). After 24 h of plating cells
at a density of 2 · 106cells per 15 cm dish, the cells were
blocked with 2 mM thymidine for 17–18 h, released from the
arrest for 9 h and arrested a second time with thymidine. After
18 h of incubation, the cells were released and collected at
different time points. To obtain populations of cells in mitosis,
cells were arrested in 2 mM thymidine for 17–18 h, released
for 4 h and blocked in 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h. Floating
mitotic cells were collected, washed twice in 1· phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and replated at a density of 4 · 106 cells
in each 15 cm dish and followed for 12 h.
FACS analysis
HeLaS3 or U2OS cells were harvested, washed in PBS and
fixed by addition of ice-cold ethanol to a final concentration of
75%. The cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in
PBS containing 10 mg/ml of propidium iodide, 0.25 mg/ml of
RNaseA and incubated overnight at 4C. For BrdU incorpora-
tion studies, briefly, human TIG3 cells were pulsed for 15 min
with 0.033 mM of BrdU, washed in PBS, trypsinized and fixed
in ethanol as described above. The cells were denatured for
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17 5459
20 min at room temperature in 2 M HCl. The cells were
neutralized with natrium borate, washed in PBS and incubated
with anti-BrdU antibody (BectonDickinson). Bound antibody
was detected using a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-mouse
IgG antibody. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in the
presence of RNase and propidium iodide for 30 min at 37C.
The samples were analysed by flowcytometry.
Recombinant E2F8
Full-length N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged human and
murine E2F8 baculovirus transfer vectors were generated
by excision of E2F8 cDNAs from pCR2.1topo and in frame
subcloning into EcoRI digested pAcHLT-A. Recombinant
baculoviruses were generated by co-transfection of bacu-
lovirus transfer vector containing the desired gene and
Bsu36I linearized Bakpak6 baculovirus DNA essentially as
described previously. Histidine-tagged E2F8 was expressed
in Trichoplusia ni, High Five, cells by recombinant baculovir-
uses using a multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were
incubated at 28C and harvested 40–44 h post infection,
washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 25 mM HEPES–
KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mM KCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2 and lysed by
Dounce homogenization. After 20 min of incubation the lys-
ates were adjusted to 350 mM NaCl and further incubated for
30 min and cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 20 000 g.
The supernatant was loaded on to a Cobalt–Sepharose column
(Clontech) (1.5 ml of resin per 109 cells) equilibrated in buffer
A (25 mM HEPES–KOH, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
DTT and 10% glycerol) adjusted to 350 mM NaCl. The col-
umn was washed with the same buffer and eluted with buffer A
adjusted to 100 mM NaCl and 100 mM imidazole. The eluted
fractions were analysed by SDS–PAGE, flash frozen in liquid
N2, and stored at 80C. All procedures were performed on
ice or at 4C in the presence of complete EDTA-free protease
inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim).
Generation of antibodies to E2F8
Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits
with affinity-purified glutathione S-transferase fused to the
C-terminal of murine E2F8 (amino acids 551–860).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
DNA-binding reactions were carried out in 25 ml of 20 mM
HEPES–KOH (pH 7.8), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM
DTT and 10% glycerol supplemented with 0.5 ml of rabbit
reticulocyte lysate and 50 mg of BSA/ml as non-specific pro-
tein carriers. Recombinant E2F8 were incubated for 10 min at
room temperature in the presence of non-specific carrier DNA
before addition of the radio-labelled probe (5 · 104 c.p.m.)
and then incubated at room temperature for a further 20 min
before being separated by electrophoresis in 0.25· TBE
through 5% native polyacrylamide gels at 4C for 3 h at
200 V. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, dried, exposed
and analysed by phosphor imaging. The sequences of the
double-stranded (ds)-oligonucleotides used in the assays were:
adenovirus E2 promoter E2F-site (E2Fwt), 50-GATCAGT-
TTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAAGATC and corresponding mutant
(E2Fmt), 50-GATCAGTTTATATCCCTTTCTCAAGATC.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
ChIP and data analysis were carried out as described previ-
ously. Briefly, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells or human
TIG3 fibroblasts were cross-linked by the addition of formal-
dehyde to 1% final concentration, the reaction was stopped by
addition of glycine, cells washed in TBS and harvested into
SDS buffer. Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended
in immunoprecipitation buffer and chromatin was sonicated to
an average size of 250 ± 750 bp. Lysates were subsequently
precleared with protein A–Sepharose beads. Precleared chro-
matin was incubated at 4C overnight with antibodies specific
for E2F1 (Sc-193), E2F3 (Sc-878), E2F4 (Sc-866) or E2F7
(12), or with an unrelated anti-Flag antibody (F3165; Sigma).
Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein A–Sepharose
beads. After extensive washes immunocomplexes were eluted
from the beads, cross links reversed and material recovered by
phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The
DNA was resuspended in 200 ml of water and 7.5 ml used per
real-time qPCR using 200 nM of primers in 25 ml SYBR
Green Reaction Mix. The primer sequences are for the
E2F1 promoter, Cyclin A2 promoter and b-actin gene are
available upon request. The primer sequences for the E2F8
promoter are indicated in Figure 5B.
Luciferase assays
To measure transcriptional activity, 4 · 104 human U2OS
cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates. Next day
the cells were transfected with combinations of reporter plas-
mid and expression vectors as described in the figure legends
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufac-
turer’s recommendations. The vector pCMV-LacZ expressing
b-galactosidase was included as an internal control and used
for normalization of the luciferase activities. Cells were
harvested 24 h after transfection, and b-galactosidase and
luciferase activity were measured essentially as described
previously (12).
Retrovirus transduction and cell-growth experiments
To generate recombinant retroviruses expressing hE2F8 and
hE2F8mt, the ORFs of hE2F8 and hE2F8mt from pEntr3C
were transferred into pBabepuro by recombination generating
pBabepuro-hE2F8 and pBabepuro-hE2F8mt. High titers of
retroviral particles were obtained 24–48 h after transfection
of the Phoenix-Eco 293 cell packing cell line. Transduction of
the human TIG3-hTert-Eco was achieved by adding virus
containing supernatants from the packaging cell line to the
cell dishes four times within a 24 h period. Transduced cells
were selected for 7 days in the presence puromycin (1 mg/ml).
The puromycin resistant cells were seeded at selected densities
and reseeded using a 3T3-like protocol as indicated in legends
of the figures.
RESULTS
Identification and cloning of E2F8
In a screen for E2F1-regulated genes, we have described
recently the identification of an E2F-like gene, E2F7 (12).
When searching GenBank using the E2F7 sequence as query,
we noticed the existence of several human and murine
5460 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17
expressed sequence tags and database accessions
showing similarity to E2F7. Two accessions NM 024680
encoding Homo sapiens FLJ23311 protein and XM149937
encoding the Mus musculus RIKEN cDNA 4432406C08
gene, respectively, appeared to harbour full-length ORFs,
since their respective start codons were preceded by
in-frame stop codons. Amplification of these ORFs from
HeLaS3 cDNA and a murine embryo cDNA library, respect-
ively, resulted in single PCR products indicating no or a low
abundance of alternative spliced transcripts in these tissues.
Subsequent, cloning and sequencing of the PCR products res-
ulted in consensus sequences identical to that of the FLJ23311
mRNA and RIKEN cDNA 4432406C08. The cloned tran-
scripts, which we have designated E2F8, contained highly
homologous ORFs capable of encoding proteins of 867 and
860 amino acids (identity 82.2%) with calculated molecular
weights of 94 272 and 93 382 Da, respectively (Figure 1A).
Alignment of human E2F7 and the human E2F8 (Figure 1B)
showed an overall identity of 31.9%, with the highest conser-
vation around the unique repeats of the two E2F-like DNA-
binding domains found in E2F7. Comparison of the putative
DNA-binding domains of E2F8 with other E2F members
demonstrates the close relationship to E2F7 (Figure 1C).
Phylogenetic analysis using a neighbour-joining (NJ) method
of the human and murine E2F8 proteins based on either the
full-length sequences or the sequences of the DNA-binding
domains, respectively, suggest that these belong to the distinct
subgroup of the E2F family presently represented by the two
isoforms of E2F7 (Figure 1D). This subgroup is characterized
by having two E2F-like DNA-binding domains (Figure 1E)
and binds DNA independently of the DP proteins. In addition,
none of the polypeptides encode the conserved sequences such
as Cyclin A phosphorylation motifs, dimerization domains,
pRB binding motif, marked box and transactivation
domain present in the two other subgroups of the E2F family.
The genomic organization of E2F8 is similar to E2F7 sug-
gesting that they originate from a common ancestral gene. The
human and murine E2F8 genes are located on chromosome
11p15.1 and short arm of chromosome 7, respectively. Both
the human and murine E2F8 genes are predicted to consist of
13 exons with the putative start ATGs located in the second
exons (data not shown). Together with the sequence similarity,
the genomic structure strongly supports that the human and
murine E2F8 genes are true orthologues.
The expression of the putative ORFs of human and murine
E2F8 were analysed by transient transfection of HeLa cells
followed by western blotting analysis of cell lysates using a
panel of expression vectors (Figure 2). Expression of E2F8
was detected using an anti-serum raised against the C-terminal
of murine E2F8. In agreement with the predicted molecular
weights, for both hE2F8 and mE2F8 major bands around
100 kDa were detected, which increased in size when the
E2F8 was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain or
Herpes simplex VP16. In addition, a number of bands with
relatively lower molecular weights were observed, which
probably represents E2F8 degradation products. In general,
we found E2F8 to be very prone to degradation. Although,
we observed bands in untransfected HeLa cells with similar
molecular weight as the E2F8 expression products after long
exposure of the blots. The non-specific reactions of the
anti-sera hampered a reliable identification of endogenous
expressed E2F8. Thus, the endogenous protein levels of
E2F8 appeared relatively low, which is in agreement with
the observed E2F8 mRNA levels as described in the following
section. After transfection of U2OS cells with Ha- or myc-
tagged E2F8 expression vectors and analysis by immuno-
fluorescence microscopy, E2F8 exhibited localization to the
nuclear compartment of the cells as judged by the overlapping
staining with DAPI (data not shown).
E2F8 and E2F7 exhibit similar expression patterns
To determine the expression levels of E2F8, we screened
cDNA from a panel of exponentially growing human cell
lines by real-time qPCR for the expression of E2F8 and
E2F7 transcripts (Figure 3). The two genes exhibited a parallel
expression pattern and were more abundantly expressed in
transformed cell lines of carcinoma or sarcoma origin consist-
ent with being an E2F-target gene. The E2F8 and E2F7 primer
sets used for qPCR exhibited similar amplification efficiency
when compared using E2F8 and E2F7 on DNA templates
indicating that the relative mRNA expression levels of E2F8
are, in general, 5–20% of the levels of E2F7.
E2F8 is an E2F-target gene
Several observations indicated that E2F8, in analogy to E2F7,
could be an E2F-regulated gene: (i) the presence of relatively
high levels of E2F8 expression in rapidly dividing cell lines;
(ii) high level of expression in HeLaS3, where the pRB-E2F
pathway is deregulated; and (iii) the clustering of putative
E2F-binding sites around the putative transcription initiation
site of the E2F8 promoter. To examine whether E2F8 is an
E2F-target gene, we used U2OS cells stably expressing E2F1
fused to the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER-
E2F1), which has been characterized previously (16,17).
Briefly, in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) ER-
E2F1 is translocated from the cytosol to nucleus of the cells
and E2F-regulated genes are induced. After 4 h of OHT induc-
tion in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX), total
RNA was isolated and the levels of E2F8 transcripts were
determined by qPCR (Figure 4A). An 10-fold up-
regulation of E2F8 mRNA levels was observed. The magni-
tude of induction was comparable with that of E2F7. Since the
up-regulation of transcript levels was observed in the presence
of CHX, the increase in E2F8 transcript levels was independ-
ent of de novo protein synthesis indicating direct binding and
activation of the promoter by ER-E2F1.
To gain further support for a role of the E2Fs in regulating
E2F8 expression, ChIP experiments using specific antibodies
to members of the E2F family were performed. As shown in
Figure 4B and C, E2F1 and to a lesser extent E2F4 and E2F7
occupied the E2F8 promoter. In contrast to E2F1, E2F4 and
E2F7 are considered to be repressors of transcription, their
presence at the E2F8 promoter indicates that the promoter is
regulated by both activating and repressing members of the
E2F family. The CCNA2 and E2F1 promoters and b-actin
gene were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
In addition, E2F3 was also found to occupy the E2F8 promoter
as determined by ChIP assays in human TIG3 fibroblasts (data
not shown). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that
E2F8 transcription is directly regulated by members of the
E2F family.

E2F8 transcription is cell-cycle regulated
The finding that E2F8 is a direct E2F-target suggests that E2F8
expression is cell-cycle regulated. To test this hypothesis,
HeLaS3 cell were synchronized in early S-phase by a double
thymidine block, while U2OS cells were synchronized to
arrest in G2/M by a thymidine block followed by release
into nocodazole-containing medium. The cells were released
from the blocks and the DNA content of the cells was determ-
ined at different time points as indicated in Figure 5A and B by

FACS analysis. Total RNA was purified, reverse transcribed
and expression of E2F8, E2F7 and selected cyclin genes were
quantitated by real-time PCR. For HeLaS3 cells, the relative
level of E2F8 peaked at the time of release, early S-phase,
which coincided with, two other E2F targets, E2F7 and Cyclin
E1. As the cells progressed through S-phase, E2F8 transcript
levels dropped and finally increased again when the cells had
gone through mitosis and started re-entering S-phase. The
expression of Cyclin B1 was included as a control for the
synchronization of the cells. For the U2OS cells, which
were arrested at G2/M, relatively low levels of E2F8 tran-
scripts were detected at the time of release (Figure 5B). How-
ever, after mitosis and entry into the S-phase, a significant
increase of E2F8 expression was observed. We also found
that E2F8 expression is induced in human TIG3 fibroblasts
after release from serum starvation (data not shown). Taken
together, the combined cell synchronization data support the
finding that E2F8 is an E2F-target gene, which is growth- and
cell-cycle regulated, and is induced at the G1–S-phase trans-
ition of the cell cycle.
E2F8 binds to consensus E2F sites
The presence of two putative E2F DNA-binding domains
highly homologous to domains of E2F7 suggested that E2F8
is also capable of associating with the E2F DNA-binding
consensus site. To determine whether E2F8 can bind directly
to E2F consensus sites, we expressed His-tagged E2F8 in
insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. Subsequently,
recombinant His-tagged E2F8 was purified; fractions were
analysed by SDS–PAGE (Figure 6A) and tested for site-
specific DNA binding by EMSAs using a 32P-labelled ds-
oligonucleotide encoding the adenovirus E2 E2F-binding
site as target. A major band revealed by Coomassie staining
with the predicted molecular weight of his-E2F8 was observed
in fractions 2–5. This band was recognized by an E2F8 anti-
serum when analysed by western blotting (data not shown)
confirming the identity of the purified expression product. The
purified fractions were tested by EMSA and gave rise to a
slower migrating complex with a signal intensity paralleling
the levels of E2F8 present in the fraction (Figure 6B).
The binding was efficiently competed by addition of
increasing amounts of unlabelled E2F ds-oligonucleotide
(Wt), while a mutation of the core GCGC sequence of the
ds-oligonucleotide (Mt) abolished its inhibitory activity
(Figure 6C). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that
E2F8 by itself binds directly to E2F consensus sites.
E2F8 is a repressor of E2F-activated transcription
To determine a role for E2F8 in E2F transcriptional regulation,
we generated a fusion protein containing E2F8 fused to the
yeast GAL4-DNA binding domain. The GAL4 DNA-binding
domain targets E2F8 independently of its intrinsic DNA bind-
ing activity to GAL4 binding sites. To test its activity we
transfected U2OS cells with a plasmid containing five Gal4
binding-sites fused to a luciferase reporter gene with the
GAL4-E2F8 expression plasmid. A b-galactosidase expres-
sion vector was co-transfected and used for normalization
of the data. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to E2F1
was included as a positive control (18). In addition, expression
constructs encoding E2F8 or E2F8 fused to transcriptional

fected with expression vectors encoding untagged or N-terminally tagged ver-
sions of hE2F8 or mE2F8 as indicated. pCMV mediates expression of untagged
hE2F8 or mE2F8, while pCMV-Ha, pCMV-Myc, pGal and pVP16 express
E2F8 fused to a Ha-epitope tag, myc-epitope tag, yeast Gal4 DNA binding
domain and herpes virus simplex VP16 transcriptional activation domain,
respectively. Expression of E2F8 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-
body against murine E2F8. The positions of a standard set of molecular weight
markers are shown on the left.

coma; U2OS, osteogenic sarcoma; BJ; MRC5; TIG3; and WI38 are all diploid

time PCR). The levels of E2F8 and E2F7 transcripts were normalized relative to
b-actin. All data were further normalized to the E2F8 or E2F7 levels present in
HeLa cells.

activation domain, VP16, were tested for their ability to trans-
activate a reporter plasmid containing an array of six E2F sites
(Figure 7A). In both assays no increase in luciferase activity
was observed indicating that E2F8 lacks the capacity to func-
tion as a transcriptional activator. However, when E2F8 was
fused to VP16, a concentration-dependent increase of luci-
ferase activity comparable with E2F1 using the pGL3-
6xE2F reporter was observed, demonstrating that E2F8
binds the promoter of the reporter gene. Together, these
data support the idea that E2F8 is a repressor of transcription.
To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of E2F8 to
inhibit E2F1-dependent transactivation. As shown in
Figure 7A, E2F8 represses in a concentration-dependent man-
ner, comparable with E2F7, the transactivation of a synthetic
promoter construct and the E2F1 promoter by E2F1. As a
control for specificity, E2F8 and E2F7 expression constructs
were unable to repress transcription from the E2F1 promoter
construct having mutations in the E2F-binding sites. Also,
the Cyclin E1 and CDC6 promoters, which are known
targets for E2F regulation, were tested for E2F8-mediated
repression (Figure 7B). Albeit the level of transcriptional
down-regulation differed, all tested promoters were repressed
proportional to the amount of input E2F8 expression vector.
These results demonstrate that E2F8 can repress E2F1-
activated transcription probably by competing or displacing
activating E2Fs from promoter binding.
Ectopic expression of E2F8 inhibits cell proliferation
E2F1–3 are required for S-phase entry and are key players in
mediating transcriptional activation of genes involved in DNA
synthesis and cell-cycle progression. We have shown previ-
ously that ectopic expression of E2F7 affects cell proliferation
and given the homology between E2F7 and E2F8, we would
predict that ectopic expression of E2F8 could inhibit cell
proliferation. To test this hypothesis, human TIG3 fibroblasts
were transduced by retroviruses carrying a puromycin resist-
ance gene and the full-length E2F8 ORF or an E2F8 (E2F8mt)
mutant carrying a double mutation in the DNA-binding domain.
As a control, a retrovirus only harbouring the puromycin
resistance gene was included. After, 7 days of puromycin
selection, the cells were plated and cell growth was evaluated

Only few cell colonies were observed for E2F8 transduced
cells when compared with E2F8 mt and the Puro control
demonstrating that ectopic expression of E2F8 inhibits cell
proliferation (Figure 8A). Accordingly, only modest growth,
with a tendency of slightly increased growth after each pas-
sage, was observed in a 3T3 assay 2.5 doublings for E2F8
over a period of four cell passages compared with 10- to 15-
fold for E2F8 mt or Puro, respectively (Figure 8B). To analyse
the inhibitory function of E2F8 in more detail, de novo DNA
synthesis was determined by pulsing the transduced cells with
BrdU and total DNA was stained with propidium iodide before
FACS analysis. For both E2F8 mt and Puro transduced cells, a
similar proportion of cells were present in the different phases
of the cell cycle and all cells in S-phase also incorporated
BrdU showing active DNA synthesis. In contrast, E2F8 trans-
duced cells had an accumulation of cells in the S-phase of
cell cycle and the major part of these were not incorporating
BrdU indicating the absence or low level of DNA synthesis.

represents a subset of cells, which are expressing no or low
levels of E2F8, since these become more abundant-dependent
on the passage number. Also the expression of E2F8 slowly
decreases after passage of the cells, probably because of the
counter selection in growing cells (data not shown). The lack
of DNA synthesis might be a consequence of down-regulation
of E2F-target genes involved in DNA synthesis or cell-cycle
control. Thus, to determine whether ectopic E2F8 expression
affected the expression of E2F-target genes, the levels of
Cyclin A2, Cyclin E1 and Cyclin B1 mRNA relative to
b-actin were quantified by qPCR (Figure 8C). While trans-
duction of cells with E2F8 mt resulted in a decrease compared
with the Puro control, a major reduction was observed for all
transcripts of E2F8-transduced cells indicating that E2F8
represses transcription of E2F-target genes. Together, the
data suggests that ectopically expressed E2F8 directly binds
the promoters and blocks transcription of E2F-target genes.
DISCUSSION
The E2F family of transcription factors is essential for orches-
trating the expression of cellular genes necessary for prolif-
eration and cell-cycle progression (2,5). Until recently, seven
members of the mammalian E2F family have been described
(6). These members can be divided into four subgroups based
on their phylogenetic relationship and function. In this report
we describe the identification of yet another putative member
of the E2F family, E2F8. Based on its unique structure,
sequence homology and function, E2F8 appears to belong
to the E2F subgroup of the E2F family currently represented
by E2F7. A similar subfamily of transcription factors E2L1–3
has been described recently in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest-
ing evolutionary conservation. The members of this subgroup
are repressors of E2F-mediated transcription and are charac-
terized by sharing a distinct structure different from the other

Figure 7. E2F8 is a repressor of E2F-responsive promoters. (A) U2OS cells were transfected with 100 ng of the reporter constructs indicated at the top of the panel.
The pGAL-Luc reporter plasmid contains the luciferase gene driven by the adenovirus E1B minimal promoter (TATA) fused to five upstream GAL4-binding sites
and was co-transfected with increasing amounts of pGAL-E2F8 or pGAL-E2F1 (10, 30 and 90 ng) of expression plasmid, respectively. pGL3-6xE2F contains six
consensus E2F sites upstream of a TATA box. The pGL3 E2F1 (242) contains 242 nt upstream of the transcription initiation site of the human E2F1 promoter linked
to a luciferase reporter. pGL3 E2F1 (242-E2F) is identical to pGL3 E2F1 (242) except that the E2F-binding sites are mutated. These reporters were co-transfected
with 30, 80 or 240 ng of pCMV-E2F8 or pCMV-E2F7b in the presence or absence of constant amounts (30 ng) of pCMV-E2F1 expression plasmid as indicated below
the panel. The amount of expression plasmid was kept constant in all assays by addition of empty pCMV vector. For correction of transfection efficiency, 100 ng of
pCMV-lacZ was included in all assays and luciferase activity was normalized to b-galactosidase activity. All experiments were performed in triplicate and
reproduced at least three times. (B) U2OS cells were transfected with 100 ng of the reporter constructs indicated at the top of the panel. pGL3-CDC6 contains1524
to + 225 bp of the human CDC6 promoter and pGL3-CyclinE1 contains 207 to 79 bp of the human CCNE1 (Cyclin E1) promoter, respectively. These reporters
were co-transfected with 30, 80 or 240 ng of pCMV-E2F8. For normalization of transfection efficiency, 100 ng of pCMV-lacZ was included in all assays as described
above.

E2Fs. It contains a tandem repeat of sequences showing high
homology with the consensus E2F DNA-binding domain.
Another feature of this subgroup is the ability to bind con-
sensus E2F DNA-binding sites in the absence of DP co-factors
(11–13).
The structure of the DNA binding domains of E2F7 and,
recently E2F8, has been predicted by computational modelling
to consist of three a-helices and a b-sheet and forms a homodi-
meric winged helix structure similar to that of the E2F-DP
heterodimer (11–15,19). Here we have shown that purified
recombinant E2F8 binds E2F sites suggesting that E2F8
also binds DNA as a homodimer in the absence of co-
factors. The possibility that a factor associating with E2F8
could potentially be present in insect cells and contributes
to binding cannot be ruled out. Although, it seems very
unlikely because of the vast overexpression of E2F8 in insect
cells and no detectable E2F-binding activity was observed in
mock-infected cells (data not shown).
Together with pocket proteins, the E2F family controls
transcription of a variety of growth and cell-cycle related
genes in the different phases of the cell cycle. In the present
study, using different cell synchronization protocols, we dem-
onstrate that E2F8 is an E2F-target gene and the peak of
transcription is confined to the late G1/early S-phase of the
cell cycle. The transcriptional kinetics of E2F8 parallels that of
Cyclin E1 and E2F7, and basal levels are reached concomitant
with the peak of Cyclin A2 (data not shown) indicating that the
functional role of E2F8 is restricted to S-phase. ChIP analysis

demonstrated that both activating and repressing members of
the E2F family occupy the E2F8 promoter in vivo suggesting
that the tight control of E2F8 expression in S-phase is medi-
ated by E2Fs. Owing to the low levels of E2F8 expression, we
were unable to detect endogenously expressed E2F8 with the
available antibodies we currently have. However, as men-
tioned previously, our observations suggest that the E2F8 pro-
tein, such as E2F7b, has a short half-life and its expression is
limited to S-phase. The short half-life may be explained by the
presence of two or three ‘KEN’ motifs present in E2F8, which
are conserved in E2F7. Such motifs are present in substrates of
the APC/C complex and target proteins for degradation upon
exit of mitosis and in non-proliferating cells (20).
E2F8 represses a variety of E2F-responsive promoters in
transient transfection assays. Furthermore, ectopic expression
of E2F8 causes down-regulation of E2F-target genes and cell-
cycle arrest. In contrast, a DNA-binding domain mutant of
E2F8 exhibits no cell-cycle arrest and impaired repression
of E2F-target genes, suggesting that E2F8 binds to a variety
of E2F-target genes and that repression is mediated by direct
binding to E2F-dependent promoters. Of note, the ectopic
expression of E2F8 ablates cell-cycle progression and DNA
replication in a major proportion of cells in S-phase, which
probably reflects the down-regulation of E2F-target genes
required for DNA synthesis. Taken together, these observa-
tions demonstrate that, when overexpressed, E2F8 acts as a
general repressor of E2F-activated transcription. Previously,
E2F7 was shown to be involved in the regulation of a subset of
E2F-regulated genes (12). When taking into consideration that
endogenous E2F8-expression levels are 5- to 20-fold lower
than E2F7 in the cell lines we have analysed, it would indicate
that E2F8 has a more restricted role in gene regulation. Other
E2Fs have been shown to interact with promoters in a com-
binatorial fashion, where activator E2Fs are dependent on an
adjacent CCAAT sites that is bound by the NF-Y transcription
factor and binding of a repressor E2Fs are dependent on an
adjacent CHR element in certain promoters. In general, it has
been proposed that combinatorial interactions involving E2F
proteins provide a basis for the specificity of transcription
control in the pRB/E2F pathway (21). Some recent data
have provided some candidate target genes potentially modu-
lated by E2F repressors. E2F6, which modulates transcription
through the recruitment of Polycomb group genes, specifically
appears to bind and repress E2F-activated genes at the G1/S
transition during S-phase (9). Similarly, E2F7 occupies pro-
moters and represses genes expressed early in the S-phase such
as E2F1, CDC6 and CCNE1 while it does not bind to the
promoters of CDC2 and CCNA2. The common theme from
these studies is that repression of early E2F targets might be
necessary for the balanced and timely regulation of genes
involved in S-phase traversal. Whether E2F8 regulates an
overlapping or specific subset of genes in the G1/S transition
or modulates a different repertoire of genes is, presently,
unclear. A conclusive determination of E2F targets regulated
by endogenous expressed E2F8 will require the development
of ChIP grade E2F8 antibodies and a detailed analysis of E2F8
occupancy at E2F-target genes in vivo.
Several of the E2Fs appear to have overlapping functions
suggesting E2F7 and E2F8 also might have redundant func-
tions. However, they show very little conservation outside the
DNA-binding domains and only short stretches of motifs in the
N- and C- termini are similar indicating specific functions of
the two polypeptides. The molecular mechanism of repression
for E2F7 and E2F8 has not been elucidated. We have evidence
that E2F7 binds a repressor through specific motifs in the C-
terminal (L. D. Stefano and K. Helin, unpublished data). These
motifs are not present in E2F8 suggesting a different mech-
anism of gene repression and a distinct role in gene regulation.
Experiments are in progress directed at understanding the
biological function, identifying target genes and the mechan-
isms of repression of E2F8.
