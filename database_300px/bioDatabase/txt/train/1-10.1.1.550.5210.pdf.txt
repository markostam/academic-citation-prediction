INTRODUCTION
Despite high success rates, implants still fail, due to wear debris (Wang etal., 2004), excessive micromotion (Soballe et al., 1992; Brunski, 1999),
or excessive loading (Hoshaw et al., 1994; Isidor, 1997; Esposito et al.,
2000). An understanding of the biological mechanisms of implant success
and failure is fundamental to the development of preventive or remedial
strategies for the treatment of loosened implants. Numerous studies
(Brånemark et al., 1977; Lazzara et al., 1999; Schatzker, 2002; Berglundh et
al., 2003; Watzak et al., 2005) have indicated that a typical initial interface
will have some regions with direct bone-implant contact and other regions
with bone-implant gaps. Regions of contact provide initial mechanical
stability, despite surgical damage to bone and bone remodeling, which
transiently increase porosity (Hoshaw et al., 1995; Huja et al., 1999). Gaps
heal through blood clotting, matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, cell
differentiation, woven bone formation, and turnover of woven bone
(Berglundh et al., 2003; Davies and Hosseini, 2000). However, the source of
skeletal progenitor cells, the rate-limiting steps that control their
differentiation into bone, the signaling molecules that direct this process,
and the role of biomechanical and biomaterial factors on cell fate decisions
remain to be elucidated. We have developed a murine model for studying
such topics at cellular and molecular levels. Here, we compared healing
around implants with healing of empty implant sites, to assess whether the
presence of an implant accelerated the initiation of bone healing.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Implants
Ti-6Al-4V implants ("Ti alloy", Whaledent, Inc., Akron, OH, USA), 1.0 mm
diameter by 2.0 mm length, were lightly sand-blasted with 25 m Al2O3 powder
and ultrasonically cleaned for 5 min. Poly(L-lactide-co-D,L,-lactide) implants
were made from "BioPin" implants (Imtec Corp., Ardmore, OK, USA). We
modified pre-sterilized BioPin implants (resembling miniature thumbtacks with
1.0 mm shank diameter and 3.5 mm length) by cutting off the pointed tip,
leaving a blunt tip and shank length 1.5 mm. Stainless steel implants ("303 SS",
Insect Pins, Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, USA) were 303 medical-grade
stainless steel, 0.25 mm diameter.
Preparation of Empty Holes and Placement of Implants 
All procedures followed protocols approved by the Institutional Committee on
Animal Research. Adult wild-type mice (males, 3-5 mos old) were anesthetized.
For empty holes, Ti alloy, and BioPin implants, a 0.8-mm hole was drilled in the
anterio-proximal tibia and enlarged via a 1.0-mm drill to minimize bone
damage, as previously described (Colnot et al., 2005). Implants were press-fitted
into slightly undersized holes, and wounds were closed. For 303 SS implants,
each pin was transfixed percutaneously in the proximal tibia, leaving only a small
ABSTRACT
While bone healing occurs around implants, the
extent to which this differs from healing at sites
without implants remains unknown. We tested the
hypothesis that an implant surface may affect the
early stages of healing. In a new mouse model, we
made cellular and molecular evaluations of
healing at bone-implant interfaces vs. empty
cortical defects. We assessed healing around Ti-
6Al-4V, poly(L-lactide-co-D,L,-lactide), and 303
stainless steel implants with surface characteristics
comparable with those of commercial implants.
Our qualitative cellular and molecular evaluations
showed that osteoblast differentiation and new
bone deposition began sooner around the implants,
suggesting that the implant surface and
microenvironment around implants favored
osteogenesis. The general stages of healing in this
mouse model resembled those in larger animal
models, and supported the use of this new model
as a test bed for studying cellular and molecular
responses to biomaterial and biomechanical
conditions.

segment across the leg. Following surgery, mice received
subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine for analgesia and were
allowed to ambulate freely. Mice were killed at days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14,
21, and 28 post-surgery (n = 2 d3, 2 d7, and 3 d10 for 303 SS
implants; n= 3 d3, 2 d5, 2 d7, 2 d10, 1 d14, 2 d21, and 2 d28 for Ti
alloy implants; and n = 3 d3, 4 d5, 5 d7, 5 d10, 2 d14, 4 d21, and 3
d28 for BioPin implants).
Tissue Processing, Histology, and in situ Hybridization
Tibiae were dissected and processed as described (Colnot et al.,
2003). Ti alloy and 303 SS implants were gently removed after
decalcification and prior to dehydration, while BioPin implants
dissolved during processing. Tissue sections were prepared for
histology with Safranin-O Fast green (SO/FG) and Trichrome
(TC), and for histochemistry with tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). Adjacent
sections were subjected to in situ hybridization analyses with
collagen type I (Col1), collagen type (Col2)II, osteocalcin (Oc),
osteopontin (Op), and runx2 (cbfa1) probes as previously
described (Colnot et al., 2003).
Surface Characterization of Implants
Implant surface roughness was measured by optical interferometry
(MicroXamTM; ADE Phase-Shift, Tucson, AZ, USA) at a
resolution of 0.05 nm (vertical) and 0.3 m (horizontal), with Sa =
arithmetic average value of vertical departures of the profile or
surface from the mean line throughout the sampling length or area;
St = maximum peak-to-valley height of the entire measurement
trace; and Sq = root mean square of values of all points of the
profile. Implant surfaces were analyzed by ESCA (electron
spectroscopy for chemical analysis) at NESAC/BIO (Univ. of
Washington, Surface Science Instruments S-probe spectrometer),
with x-ray spot size ~ 800 m and sampling depth ~ 50 Å.
RESULTS
Healing in Empty Implant Sites
We first determined how an implant site healed in the absence
of any device, as a baseline for comparing healing around
various implants. We examined the program of bone healing
using histological stains to detect cartilage and bone. At all
time-points (post-surgical d3-28), we never detected cartilage
(data not shown) and found evidence of only new bone (Fig. 1,
Trichrome panels). Thus, empty implant sites healed
exclusively through intramembranous ossification.
Next, we determined the time-course of reparative
osteogenesis. On d3, there was minimal Aniline-blue-stained
bony matrix, no Safranin-O-stained cartilaginous matrix, and
no TRAP staining (data not shown), indicating that bone
healing had not yet initiated. By d5, some TRAP activity was
detectable, but in the absence of new cartilage or bone matrix,
this activity probably represented osteoclasts resorbing old
bone debris, or macrophages at the injury site (Figs. 1A, 1B).
By d7, abundant amounts of bone matrix were evident, which
was in the process of being remodeled by osteoclasts (Figs. 1C
1D). From d7 to d28, new bone formation was coupled with
bone remodeling, resulting in a patent bone marrow cavity and
intact cortical plate (Figs. 1E 1F), with only microscopic
evidence of the site where newly deposited bone matrix
juxtaposed with the old injured cortical bone (arrow, Fig. 1E).
Thus, a 1.0-mm implant bed showed the first signs of
reparative intramembranous ossification at d7, and was
completely remodeled by d28.
Histological analyses indicated that new bone formed in
the empty implant site by d7. To pinpoint the actual onset of
osteogenesis, rather than its histological manifestation, we
conducted molecular analyses at earlier time-points. We
examined expression of 3 genes: Collagen type I (Col I),
Osteocalcin (Oc),  and Osteopontin (Op).  On d3, we
identified cells in the injury site that expressed Col I (Fig.
2A, arrow), suggesting initiation of an osteogenic program.
The lack of Oc and Op expression in adjacent sections
indicated that cells had not yet differentiated into osteoblasts
(Figs. 2B, 2C). The progressive increase in Col1, Oc, and Op
expression from d5 to d7 indicated that cells initiated
differentiation into osteoblasts during this window (Figs. 2D-
2I). These analyses provided a molecular map illustrating
initiation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in
an empty site.
Healing at Ti Alloy and PLA Bone-Implant Interfaces
Next, we ascertained how the presence of an implant in the
injury site affected the course of new bone formation and cell
differentiation. Because of their common use in dental
applications, we focused on cellular responses to Ti alloy and
BioPin implants. By d3, no sign of new bone deposition was
detected by histological analyses (Figs. 3J, 3K). On d5, we
noted approximately the same amount of new bone at the
Figure 1. Establishing the time-course and type of healing in the implant
bed. A 1.0-mm drill hole was created in the proximal tibiae; samples
were then collected at d5, d7, and d28, and stained with Trichrome
(TC) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). (A-B) At d5, there
is no evidence of new bone formation. The injury site is filled with
densely packed fibroblasts, (B) while bone debris from the drilling
process is engulfed by TRAP-positive osteoclasts. (C-D) By d7, new bone
is first detected and undergoes rapid remodeling. (E-F) By d28, woven
bone has been replaced by cortical bone fused with the old cortex.

endosteal surface and marrow interfaces in both Ti alloy and
BioPin samples (Figs. 3A, 3B). By d7, there was an increase in
new bone trabeculae (Figs. 3D, 3E), which became
progressively remodeled. By d28, a thin shell of bone encased
both Ti alloy and BioPin implants (Figs. 3G, 3H). These
analyses suggested that cells responded to Ti alloy and BioPin
implant surfaces equivalently.
Although each implant was press-fit into its site, the
cortical edges did not always come uniformly into contact with
the implant surface; there were regions of bone contact and
gaps (~ 0-60 m) between implant and cortex (Fig. 3). We
found that the time-course of repair was equivalent whether or
not a small gap existed (compare Figs. 3J, 3L [no gap], with
Figs. 3K, 3M [gap]). Larger gaps were occupied by
extracellular matrix and cells, which gradually differentiated
into bone (Figs. 3K, 3M), whereas smaller gaps were occupied
by new osteoblasts (Fig. 3L arrowheads).
Osteoblast Differentiation 
is Accelerated in the Presence of an Implant
Since new bone was detected earlier by histological analyses
around implants vs. empty defects, we further analyzed early
stages of healing. With implants present, Trichrome staining
revealed a faint amount of Aniline-blue-positive matrix at d5
(Fig. 4A, arrowhead). Alkaline phosphatase activity indicated
the onset of mineralization (Fig. 4B, arrows), and TRAP
activity indicated matrix remodeling (Fig. 4C). Thus, relative to
an empty site, implant presence resulted in accelerated
differentiation of peri-implant cells
into osteoblasts, and acceleration in
the remodeling of new bone
matrix. We confirmed this using in
situ hybridization, noting that cells
around the implant up-regulated
the osteoblast-related transcription
factors Runx2 and Op at d3 (Figs.
4D, 4E). Lack of Collagen type II
(Col II) expression around the
implant indicated that intra -
membranous ossification was the
mechanism of new bone formation
at implant sites (Fig. 4F).
Surface Characterization 
of Implants
Given the importance of a
biomaterial's surface (Albrektsson
and Wennerberg, 2004; Monsees
et al., 2005; Sul et al., 2005), we
measured roughness at  5-10
locations on each implant type:
mean and standard deviations for
Sa were: 0.548 ± 0.0336 m for
Ti alloy implants; 0.709 ± 0.217
m for BioPin implants;  and
0.185 ± 0.08 m for 303 SS
implants. ESCA revealed that Ti
alloy implants had surface
contamination represented by C
(53-56 at.%), N (1.5-1.7 at.%), Si
(2-2.8 at.%), Na (2.1-2.5 at.%),
and Ca (0.4-0.6 at.%), besides O
and Ti in the oxide on this alloy (Ask et al., 1989). BioPin
surfaces showed C (61-62 at .%) and O (37-38 at .%)
consistent with its polylactic acid (PLA) content, plus Si (1.3
at.%) concentrated on the circumferential ridges. The C/O
ratio at the BioPin surface was 1.65, indicating hydrocarbon
contamination, since the C/O ratio for PLA is 1.3. For 303
SS pins, analyses revealed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),
whose theoretical composition is 50 at.% C, 25 at.% O, and
25 at.% Si. This layer was thick enough to prevent detection
of the expected Cr2O3 oxide on the 303 SS surface (Sundgren
et al., 1985).
DISCUSSION
Cortical Bone Defect Healing and Interfacial Healing 
in the Mouse Model vs. Larger Animal Models
This study identified similarities and differences between
cortical defect and interfacial healing. Early stages of healing in
both were characterized by the formation of a hematoma,
recruitment of matrix-resorbing cells, and deposition of woven
bone in the empty defect or surrounding the implant. Woven
bone was remodeled into lamellar bone, bridging the two
cortical bone ends of the empty defect, or leaving behind a thin
interfacial layer of bone at the implant surface. Our data on
cortical defect healing complement previous findings of defect
healing in rodent and larger animal models (Pritchard, 1964;
Schenk and Hunziker, 1994; Chiba et al., 2001; Uusitalo et al.,
Figure 2. Molecular analyses of healing in the implant bed. Localization of mRNA for collagen type I
(Col 1), Osteocalcin (Oc), and Osteopontin (Op) by in situ hybridization on sections adjacent to those
shown in Fig. 1. (A-C) By d3, low expression levels for Col 1 are found in the marrow cavity (arrow),
while Oc and Op are not expressed. (D-F) By d5, Col 1 is up-regulated in and around the defect within
the marrow cavity. Oc mRNA is still not detected. Op-expressing cells are localized near the cortical
defect (asterisk). (G-I) By d7, strong expression of all three markers is detected in the defect and in the
marrow space underlying the defect. Scale bar = 200 microns. (See color version of this Fig. in the
online APPENDIX.)

2001; Campbell et al., 2003), wherein small islands of cartilage
were sometimes also observed on periosteal surfaces.
Interfacial healing in our mouse model shared some key
features with interfacial healing around implants in other
animal models, such as rats (Nanci et al., 1994; Masuda et al.,
1997), rabbits (Schenk and Hunziker, 1994), dogs (Hoshaw et
al., 1994), sheep (Plenk and Zitter, 1996), monkeys (Watzak et
al., 2005), and humans (Lazzara et al., 1999)—with
intramembranous bone healing in empty defects and around
implants.
Differences in Timing of Bone Formation 
around Implants and in Empty Holes
Analysis of our cellular and molecular data indicates that: (1)
cells surrounding implants initiated differentiation into
osteoblasts sooner than when no implant was at the site; and (2)
the timing of osteoblast differentiation and new bone matrix
deposition was equivalent among the three implant
biomaterials. One explanation for this is that an implant
provides a surface onto which osteoblasts can adhere and
deposit a matrix that mineralizes, and that this surface was
similar among our implants. The range of roughness values for
our implants was narrow (Sa, 0.185-0.709 m) and at the lower
end of values for "smooth" (Sa, 0 to 0.4 m) and "minimally
rough" (Sa, 0.5 to 1.0 m) implants (e.g., Sa ~ 0.46 for
machined Brånemark implants). Also, our implants were not as
rough as "moderately rough" (Sa, 0.5 to 1.0 m) or "rough" (Sa,
> 2.0 m) implants, e.g., Sa ~ 0.91 m for "OsseoSpeed"
implants; and Sa ~ 1.6 m for SLA implants (Albrektsson and
Wennerberg, 2004; Ellingsen et al., 2004; Sul et al., 2005).
While a recent review (Shalabi et al., 2006) reported "a positive
effect on the bone response...from Ra/Sa of ~ 0.5 m up to ~
8.5 m", our narrow Sa range was at the lower end of that
range. Moreover, our ESCA data showed comparable values of
carbon on surfaces of all implants. (Commercial Ti implants
can also have high carbon levels on their surfaces; Wieland et
al., 2000; Massaro et al., 2002.) Ultimately, quantitative
analyses would complement our qualitative spatial and
temporal gene expressions. For example, our in situ data from
mice are consistent with Ogawa and Nishimura's (2006) RT-
PCR data from tissues near Ti implants and at osteotomy sites
in rat tibiae, which showed a 1.5- to two-fold up-regulation of
collagen I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin expression (but not
Runx2 and Bmp2) at 3 and 7 days after surgery.
Is Osseointegration Equivalent to Fracture Healing?
Concerning the oft-claimed analogy between fracture healing
and interfacial healing (Brånemark et al., 1977; Brånemark,
1985; Pilliar and Simmons, 2002; Schatzker, 2002), both
begin with a breach in an intact skeletal element, an immune
response, neo-vascularization, and recruitment of skeletal
progenitor cells. However, in a typical fracture, some skeletal
progenitor cells differentiate into chondrocytes, while others
differentiate into osteoblasts, followed by endochondral
ossification. Around an implant, all skeletal progenitor cells
differentiate directly into osteoblasts,  followed by
intramembranous ossification. Perhaps the key difference
between fracture healing and interfacial healing is that the
latter involves cellular and molecular responses that may be
influenced by biomaterial  surface texture,  chemical
composition, and implant biomechanics. In that context,
advantages of the mouse model include its ability to allow
for detailed molecular analyses, and the use of mouse
mutants for the study of bone healing.

On d3, the direct bone-implant interface was not populated by cells,
whereas in (K), the gap interface was filled with a fibrous hematoma
(bracket). (L) By d28, new bone was juxtaposed to the implant
(arrowheads indicate stained nuclei of new osteoblasts), while in the gap
(M), a new bone interface has been created by the mineralization of the
fibrous matrix (bracket), and stained nuclei distinguish new osteoblasts
from old osteocytes. Scale bar in A and corresponding magnifications =
0.5 mm; C and other high-magnification images = 50 microns. (See color

expression. Scale bar = 200 microns. (See color version of this Fig. in the online APPENDIX.)
