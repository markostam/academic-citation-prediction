ABSTRACT
Here we describe a novel endonuclease IV (Endo IV)
based assay utilizing a substrate that mimics the
abasic lesions that normally occur in double-
stranded DNA. The three component substrate is
characterized by single-stranded DNA target, an
oligonucleotide probe, separated from a helper
oligonucleotide by a one base gap. The oligonu-
cleotide probe contains a non-fluorescent quencher
at the 50 end and fluorophore attached to the 30 end
through a special rigid linker. Fluorescence of the
oligonucleotide probe is efficiently quenched by
the interaction of terminal dye and quencher when
not hybridized. Upon hybridization of the oligonu-
cleotide probe and helper probe to their comple-
mentary target, the phosphodiester linkage between
the rigid linker and the 30 end of the probe is
efficiently cleaved, generating a fluorescent signal.
In this study, the use of the Endo IV assay as
a post-PCR amplification detection system is
demonstrated. High sensitivity and specificity are
illustrated using single nucleotide polymorphism
detection.
INTRODUCTION
Nucleic acid assays utilizing cleavage enzymes to generate
a fluorescent signal from dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide
probes have been extensively used in diagnostics (1–3). In
these assays, the ability of fluorescent dyes to transfer energy
absorbed from light to nearby molecules forms the basis of
homogeneous nucleic acid based assays (1,4,5). In the unhy-
bridized state the fluorophore and quencher are within close
proximity, which allows the quencher to absorb energy
from the fluorophore to affect quenching. The use of fluoro-
genic probes in a 50-nuclease polymerase assay, where the
probe is enzymatically cleaved to release the fluorophore
(2), is well known. The signal amplification reaction utilizes
invasive cleavage with structure-specific 50-nucleases (6).
The method requires annealing of two oligonucleotides,
called the upstream oligonucleotide and the probe, to a target
sequence, which results in the formation of a unique substrate
for the 50-nuclease. In the DNAzyme-PCR strategy the primer
contains a target-specific sequence and harbors the antisense
sequence of a 10–23 DNAzyme. During amplification,
amplicons are produced containing active sense copies of
DNAzymes that cleave a reporter substrate included in the
reaction mixture (7). A target nucleic acid sequence can be
amplified exponentially in vitro under isothermal conditions
by using three enzymatic activities essential to retroviral rep-
lication: reverse transcriptase, RNase H (RNA cleavage) and
a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (8). Cycling probe tech-
nology represents a simple method for the detection of DNA
target sequences, utilizing a chimeric DNA–RNA–DNA
probe which is cleaved by RNase H when hybridized with
its complementary target (9).
Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA arise via sponta-
neous or mutagen-induced hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic
bond, or through the repair activity of DNA glycosylases
(10). If left unrepaired, AP sites are potentially lethal or
mutagenic (11). To cope with the deleterious consequences
of AP sites, organisms possess AP endonucleases that initiate
the repair of these DNA lesions (10). Class II AP endo-
nucleases initiate repair by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the
50-phosphodiester of an abasic site to generate a 30-OH
group and a 50-abasic phosphate residue (10). The substrate
specificity of human apurinic endonuclease on synthetic sub-
strate analogs has been reported previously (12).
Here we describe a novel endonuclease IV (Endo IV) assay
substrate (Figure 1C) that mimics the abasic lesions that
normally occur in double-stranded DNA (Figure 1A and B).
The first lesion (Figure 1A) is a typical abasic (apurinic or
apyrimidinic site generated by spontaneous or enzymatic
loss of a nucleic acid base. The second lesion (Figure 1B)
is an atypical abasic site appearing as a result of inherent
instability of the 30-phosphodiester bond in abasic deoxyri-
bose in lesion 1 or its cleavage by a Class I AP endonuclease.
As shown by the arrow, AP endonucleases cleave the phos-
phodiester linkage at the abasic sites. In the novel Endo IV
assay a short probe with a fluorophore linked through a
phosphate at the 30 end and a short enhancer oligonucleotide
generate an artificial, lesion 2 type Endo IV substrate. This
arrangement allows the specific and efficient cleavage of

the phosphodiester bond of the probe by Endo IV and release
of fluorescent dye (Figure 1C). The addition of a quencher at
the 50 end of the probe allows quenching of the fluorescence
in the uncleaved probe. The specific cleavage of the phos-
phate bond and the generation of fluorescence is the basis
of the new assay.
In this study we used endonuclease IV from Escherichia
coli (Endo IV). The enzyme functions as a Class II AP endo-
nuclease and as a 30 terminal phosphodiesterase (13,14). Endo
IV is enzymatically similar to exonuclease III, the major AP
endonuclease of E.coli, but it differs from the latter enzyme
mainly in lacking the associated exonuclease activity (14).
It was also found that E.coli Endo IV is fairly heat stable
to 70C (15,16).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Full characterization for all the compounds described below
can be found in the Supplementary Data.
Nucleic acid templates
A total of 102 unrelated Centre Etude Polymorphism
Humaine DNA samples were obtained from the Coriell
Institute of Medical Research (http://locus.umdnj.edu/) after
specifying that the DNA samples should be used for research
purpose only. The list of templates used is available at http://
snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov.
Synthesis of fluorophore-modified controlled
pore glass supports
For the synthesis of the fluorophore-modified controlled pore
glass(CPG) supports, please see the Supplementary Data.
Synthesis of oligonucleotide conjugates
Fluorogenic probes were synthesized on fluorophore-linker-
based CPG supports (Scheme 1) using standard 30-DNA-
phosphoramidites. An Eclipse Dark Quencher was introduced
at the 50 end using the corresponding phosphoramidite (www.
glenresearch.com). Probes were purified by reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), dried
and re-dissolved in 1· TE buffer. A nearest-neighbor model
was applied to calculate extinction coefficient (e260) of oligo-
nucleotides (17). A260 measurements were made in PBS
(pH 7.2) at ambient temperature and assumed to be a random
coil DNA structure in solution. For each Eclipse Quencher,
fluorophore 1 (FL1), fluorophore 2 (FL2) or fluorophore
3 (FL3) substitution an e260 correction of +6600, +18 500,
or +25 100 or 28 600 M1 cm1 was used, respectively.
Preparation of labeled probes with aminohexanoyl-
extended hydroxyprolinol linker (FI 4, Table 1)
30-Hydroxyprolinol modified probe precursor was synthe-
sized using a modified CPG support (18), and 30-DNA-
phosphoramidites and Eclipse Quencher phosphoramidite
on a 0.2 mmol scale. The probe was purified by reverse-
phase HPLC using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1 M triethy-
lammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8–9) followed by drying
in a SpeedVac evaporator. The probe precursor was re-
dissolved in 50 ml of dry DMSO and treated with 10 mmol
of pentafluorophenyl N-FMOC-6-aminohexanoate (19) for
10 h. The FMOC-aminohexanoyl modified probe was iso-
lated by reverse-phase HPLC and deprotected by treatment
with concentrated ammonium hydroxide for 1 h at room
temperature. The deprotected oligonucleotide was further
purified by reverse-phase HPLC using the triethyl-
ammonium bicarbonate buffer as described above, dried
and re-dissolved in 50 ml of dry DMSO. To this solution,
10 mmol compound 8c (Scheme 2) and 1 ml triethylamine
were added. After being kept at room temperature for
10 h the reaction was combined with 1 ml of 2% solution

further purified by reverse-phase HPLC, dried and re-
constituted in 1· TE buffer. An additional molar absorbance
(e260) of 28 500 M1 cm1 was used in the probe concentra-
tion calculation to correct for the presence of the dye.
Synthesis of the dye-modified CPG supports
The synthesis of special CPG supports for the preparation of
required oligonucleotide probes are shown in Schemes 1–3.
Methyl 3-(3-chloro-2,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoate (4a)
(Scheme 1) was synthesized starting from 3-chloro-2,4-
dimethoxybenzaldehyde (1) (20), which was converted to
substituted cinnamic acid 2 by Knoevenagel condensation.
Intermediate 2 was hydrogenated in the presence of Pd/C to
yield substituted phenyl propionic acid 3, which was first
demethylated with HBr/HOAc and then converted to the
methyl ester 4a.
Synthesis of the pentafluorophenyl ester dye intermediates

is shown in Scheme 2. Compounds 4a and b were reacted
with substituted phthalic anhydrides in the presence of
AlCl3 to give the benzophenones 5, which were reacted

anhydride generated lactones 8, which were first reacted with
the DMT-protected hydroxyprolinol 9 (21) and then with
trimethylacetic anhydride to afford the protected dyes 10.
Reaction of intermediates 10 first with succinic anhydride
and then with pentafluorophenyl trifluoroacetate, yielded the
PFP esters 11.
The reaction of the PFP ester 11 with the long chain ami-
noalkyl CPG (LCAA-CPG) yielded the desired CPG supports
12 as shown in Scheme 1.
Optimization of Endo IV enzyme activity
Endo IV cleavage activity was measured in real-time as
shown in Figure 2. The model system in Figure 3A was
used to determine optimum E.coli Endo IV (Trevigen,
Gaithersburg, MD) concentration, magnesium concentration
and pH; the latter two were determined to be at 20 mM
Tris buffer, pH 8.6. Results are shown in the Supplementary
Data.
ENDO IV ASSAY
PCR
PCR was conducted in 384-well plates on MJ Research PTC-
200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (Waltman, MA). Fifty cycles of
three-step PCR profile (95C for 5 s, 58C for 30 s, 72C
for 30 s) were run after an initial 2 min denaturation step at
95C. Each 5 ml PCR contained 2.5 ml JumpStart Taq
ReadyMix (Sigma, MI) and 5–10 ng lyophilized human
genomic DNA from Coriell Biorepository (Camdem, NJ).
Primer concentrations were 0.1 and 1.0 mM for forward and
reverse primers, respectively. A Biomek 2000 Laboratory
Automation Station (Beckman Coulter, USA) was used to
set up PCRs.
The Endo IV Master Mixture was prepared by mixing
appropriate volumes of 5· Endo IV reaction buffer
[100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), 25 mM MgCl2, 5· E.coli
Endo IV enzyme solution, 50% glycerol, 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100,
0.02 U E.coli Endo IV enzyme and 20· of Endo IV Probes/
Enhancer Master Mixture], containing each probe and
enhancer at 20 mM concentration.
Post-PCR Endo IV reaction
The endo IV reaction was prepared by adding 5 ml Endo IV
Master Mixture to 5 ml PCR mixture. Reaction was incubated
at 50C for 50–60 min. Fluorescent detection was performed
on ABI 7700 or 7900 in the two channels typically used
to detect FAM (for FL1) and VIC (for FL2, FL3 and FL4)
utilizing the ABI software for Allelic Discrimination.
Alternatively, the fluorescence could also be detected in a
Figure 2. Monitoring of fluorescence by the Endo IV cleavage reaction was
performed in 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5). The three component
substrate complex used in these experiments is shown. FL1 is a fluorescein
derivative and Q is the Eclipse Dark Quencher, structures of which are
shown in Figure 3B and D, respectively. The reaction mixture contained Endo
IV at 0.04 U/ml concentration, probe and enhancer at 150 nM, and the target
at 5 nM. The experiment was performed on LightCycler.

Tm determination
Thermodynamic parameters of duplex formation were derived
by the van’t Hoff analysis methods. The shape of each melt-
ing curve was fitted to the two-state model with linear base
lines (22) using a nonlinear least-square program (23). Unless
otherwise stated, Tm of DNA duplexes were measured at a
concentration of 5 · 107 M in 1· PCR buffer containing
10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM MgCl2 and 40 mM
NaCl, as described earlier (23).
Primers, enhancer and probe design
The MGB Eclipse Design Software 3.0 (http://www.
nanogen.com/products/customassays/mgb_ecliplse/) was
used to design the primers for PCR. It was also used to cal-
culate the Tm of the enhancer and probe.
RESULTS
Endo IV assay
An example of the new Endo IV-based assay is shown in
Figure 2. A probe and an enhancer are hybridized to a com-
plementary synthetic target with a one base gap between
them.
The signal is substantially diminished in the absence of the
enhancer. A rigid hydroxyprolinol linker (Figure 3B) between
the oligonucleotide and fluorophore FL1, critical for sensitiv-
ity and specificity, was used in this experiment. The results
in Figure 2 illustrate the importance of all components used
in the assay. The cleavage of the fluorophore is highly target
dependent and its rate is amplified in the presence of the
enhancer oligonucleotide. Very low non-target-dependent
cleavage is an important feature of the Endo IV assay.
Optimization of Endo IV enzyme activity
Effects of pH and cations on E.coli Endo IV activity was
determined using the probe, enhancer and target
(Figure 3A). It was shown that Endo IV cleavage of the
probe has a relatively flat pH optimum in the range between
pH 8.5 and 9.5. For compatibility with post-PCR Endo IV
amplification the assay buffer with pH 8.6 was chosen,
similar to that of the PCR master mixture. Inclusion of the
divalent magnesium cation in the buffer ranging from 0 to
20 mM, resulted in more than 2-fold increase in cleavage
rate, the optimum range was 5–8 mM. A concentration of
5 mM was chosen for the Endo IV assay. It was determined
that the monovalent cations, such as Li, Na, K and Rb, inhibit
Endo IV cleavage activity for the concentrations studied in
the range from 0 to 100 mM. An inhibition of 30% was
observed at 20 mM monovalent cation concentration, which
increased to 60–70% at 100 mM concentration. The opti-
mum probe concentration was determined to be 600 nM,
please see Supplementary Figures 1–3.
Optimization of fluorophore and linker structures
Figure 3A shows a model Endo IV assay that requires a target
complementary to an enhancer and a probe labeled at the 50
end with an Eclipse Dark Quencher and a fluorescent dye at
the 30 end. As shown, the probe (calculated Tm ¼ 46.7C) and
enhancer (calculated Tm ¼ 50.2C) are separated by one base
to mimic a natural abasic site. Four probes with different fluo-
rescent dyes and linkers (Figure 3B) were evaluated for their
performance in the new assay. Fluorophores FL1, FL2 and
FL3 of the probes I, II and III (with similar quantum yields)

contained a hydroxyprolinol linker between the 30-phosphate
of the probe sequence and the core of the dyes. Fluorophore
FL4 of probe IV was analogous to FL3 of probe III, with
an additional aminocaproic spacer introduced between the
hydroxylprolinol moiety and the dye; the purpose of this
spacer was to distance the fluorophore from the cleavage site.
The probe specificity was evaluated by comparing the
cleavage rates in the presence and absence of target. Target-
dependent (specific) and target-independent (non-specific)
cleavage rates of the probe were measured as the percent
target cleaved per minute. The results are summarized in
Table 1. Probes I–III demonstrated similar specific cleavage.
A 2- to 3-fold decrease in the rate of non-specific cleavage for
probes II and III versus probe I was observed. These low,
non-specific cleavage rates translate into high-specific to
non-specific cleavage ratios. It appears that chloro- or chloro/
methyl substitutions in the fluorophores of probes II and III,
respectively, are beneficial for the reduction of non-specific
cleavage. One possible explanation for this reduction may
be an effect of increased hydrophobicity of FL2 and FL3
on enzyme activity. In the case of probe IV, with the
extended hydroxyprolinol linker, the rate of specific cleavage
almost doubled. However, the corresponding increase in the
rate of non-specific cleavage was 20 times higher than
that observed in probe III, substantially compromising the
ratio of specific to non-specific cleavage rates. Once again,
this result implies the existence of inhibiting interactions
between Endo IV enzymatic activity and fluorophore which
can be adjusted by moving the fluorophore away from the
active center.
The rigid hydroxyprolinol linker with low non-specific
cleavage rates utilized in probes I–III was identified as the
linker of choice in the Endo IV assays.
The use of a flexible, straight chain linker (C6) instead of
hydroxyprolinol-based linker increased the rates of non-
specific cleavage to even higher degree than the extended
hydroxyprolinol linker and reduced the specific to non-
specific ratios to an unacceptable level (data not shown).
It appears that both the structure of the sterically con-
strained hydroxyprolinol linker and proximity of the bulky
dye moiety to the cleavage site moderate cleavability of the
30-terminal phosphodiester bond and practically eliminate
non-template-dependent cleavage.
Enhancer optimization
Figure 4A shows the target, probe and the enhancer aligned
with the target to indicate different gaps. The Tm of the
enhancer is typically chosen to be at least 5C higher than
that of the probe. The cleavage rates in the presence of
enhancer are shown with 1–5 base gaps (Figure 4B). As
expected, based on the natural abasic substrate requirement
shown in Figure 1B, a one base gap gave the highest cleavage
rate. The probe in the absence of enhancer showed a cleavage

rate nearly equivalent to that of a 4 base gap in the presence
of enhancer. As shown in Figure 4C, the maximum cleavage
rate is achieved at a concentration of enhancer greater than
80 nM. In practice, the concentration of the enhancer is
typically at least equivalent or larger than that of the probe.
Some cleavage is observed with no enhancer present.
Probe Tm optimization
Figure 5 shows how the cleavage rate of probes with different
Tms changes with temperature. Probe lengths ranging from a
6mer to a 14mer were investigated and are shown in Figure 5
with calculated Tms of between 14 and 60
C. All the probes
showed a bell-shaped relationship for cleavage rate with
temperature. As expected, the cleavage rate for all probes
increased with increased temperature. A relatively sharp
cleavage rate optimum was observed for the probes a, b
and c with calculated Tms of 60, 48 and 42, respectively. It
appears that the best probe cleavage occurs close to the
calculated Tm or slightly above it. Performing the assay at a
temperature slightly higher than the Tm (Figure 5) showed
not only optimum activity but also appears to allow probe
cleavage cycling, an important feature of this assay.
Determination of assay sensitivity
The ability of the Endo IV assay to detect different target
concentrations is shown in Figure 6. It was observed that in
the case of 125 nM target concentration, the probe-based
fluorescence plateaued in 1 h, while in the presence of 25
nM target a fluorescence plateau was reached in 3 h. The
limit of detection of this assay is 0.04 nM, clearly distinguish-
able from the stable background (Figure 6). This stable back-
ground, a characteristic feature of the assay, is maintained
over a period of 15 h. This property is also observed in the
assay with other nucleic acid targets.
Mismatch discrimination
The ability of the Endo IV assay to discriminate mismatches
at different positions of a 14mer probe is illustrated in
Figure 7. Mismatches were introduced in the probe one at
a time, from positions 1 to 8. The Endo IV assay shows
excellent specificity for the different mismatches from base
1 to base 6 with large match/mismatch signal ratios. As
shown in Figure 7, the mismatch signal is often about the
same as that of the NTC or slightly higher. The exceptions
are the difficult 4-G/T- and 8-T/G-mismatches (24) where
match/mismatch ratios of 16 and 7 were observed, respec-
tively. These ratios are quite adequate to differentiate
matched and mismatched sequences. It appears (data not
shown) that the discrimination in positions 1 and 2 is largely
determined by substrate requirements while discrimination in
other positions is determined by thermodynamic considera-
tions. Experiments with a large number of assays have also
indicated that, with 10mer to 12mer probes, satisfactory dis-
crimination is observed with the mismatch position in all
except the last three bases at the 50 end.
The exquisite specificity of the Endo IV assay appears to
be the result of at least two factors. The first is the strict

intrinsic substrate specificity requirement of the Endo IV
enzyme which appears to require the rigid prolinol linker
(Figure 3B, n ¼ 0) used in the probes I–III. Second, the
use of short probes (10mer to 12mer) gives the Endo IV a
distinct advantage over most other assays where probes are
typically much longer (1,2,6,25).
Post-PCR Endo IV genotyping
The application of the Endo IV cleavage as a post-PCR
detection system is shown in Figures 8 and 9. Following an
asymmetric PCR using primers to produce predominantly
single-stranded amplicon, two allele-specific probes, an
enhancer and Endo IV enzyme are added to the amplification
mixture and incubated isothermally for about an hour. The
cleaved fluorescence from the two allele-specific probes, each
labeled with a different fluorescent dye, is then plotted in a scat-
ter diagram as shown in Figures 8 and 9 for the genotyping
analysis of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
which are of immediate importance to in cancer (http://
snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov). The scatter diagrams of two poly-
morphisms, namely agouti signal molecular epidemiology
studies protein (ASIP-01) and adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC-03) (http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov) are shown in
Figures 8 and 9, respectively. In both cases, a probe specific
to the wild-type allele is labeled with FL1 and a probe specific
for the mutant allele labeled with FL3 is used.
The probe sets, designed to analyze ASIP-01 and APC-03
polymorphisms, were used to assay 102 unrelated human
DNA samples obtained from the Coriell Institute. In the
case of the ASIP-01 target the mismatch was situated two
bases from the 30 end of the probe, while in the case of
APC-03, the mismatch was six bases from the 30 end of the
probe.
From our experience, the spacing of the allele clusters in
Figures 8 and 9 are comparable or better than those scatter
plots observed in other methods (2,26,27). The exquisite spe-
cificity achieved with the Endo IV enzyme, combined with
the shorter probes used and the high signal accumulation,
gives this assay an advantage over other SNP assays. In com-
parison with other signal accumulating assays (2), the Endo
IV assay has similar levels of high signal accumulation, but
uses shorter probes with higher specificity than those assays.
In the case of hybridization-based assays (5,25), the Endo IV
assay has not only a signal accumulation advantage, but also
uses shorter probes with a specificity advantage. In addition,
the shorter probes allow much more flexibility in assay design
compared to other methods with longer probes.
CONCLUSIONS
We disclosed a novel nucleic acid signal detection system
based on the cleavage of a phosphodiester linkage in a dual-
dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe by the Endo IV enzyme
from E.coli. The parameters influencing the activity of the
Endo IV enzyme were optimized. This optimized Endo IV
detection assay requires, in addition to an oligonucleotide
probe substrate, a fluorophore attached through a relatively
rigid linker to the oligonucleotide and a helper oligonucleo-
tide. The rigid linker conveys the exquisite specificity of
Endo IV cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage in the
probe and shows high-specific/non-specific rate ratios. The
synthesis of fluorophore analogs coupled to a rigid linker
and solid support, used in the synthesis of labeled oligo-
nucleotides, was also disclosed. Excellent mismatch discrim-
ination is observed from positions 1 to 6 in a 12mer probe.
The ability to put the mismatch in any one of positions 1–6,

allows for flexibility in probe design for genotyping assays
where sequence and secondary structural constraints are con-
sidered. This method allows the use of probes shorter than
those typically used in other methods (28) contributing to
the improved mismatch discrimination.
The combination of the Endo IV assay with a PCR as a
post-amplification detection system has been demonstrated.
Post-PCR Endo IV genotyping shows excellent spacing of
scatter plot endpoint signals of no template controls, wild-
type, mutant and heterozygous samples allowing clear allele
differentiation. In contrast, other endpoint genotyping meth-
ods may suffer from overlapping endpoint signals due to
PCR efficiency issues (25,29). This Endo IV post-PCR geno-
typing has been successfully used in an industry setting for
>5000 genotype assays.
