Abstract
Background: Mast cell-derived prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), may contribute to eosinophilic
inflammation and mucus production in allergic asthma. Chemoattractant receptor homologous
molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2), a high affinity receptor for prostaglandin D2, mediates
trafficking of TH2-cells, mast cells, and eosinophils to inflammatory sites, and has recently attracted
interest as target for treatment of allergic airway diseases. The present study involving mice
explores the specificity of CRTH2 antagonism of TM30089, which is structurally closely related to
the dual TP/CRTH2 antagonist ramatroban, and compares the ability of ramatroban and TM30089
to inhibit asthma-like pathology.
Methods: Affinity for and antagonistic potency of TM30089 on many mouse receptors including
thromboxane A2 receptor mTP, CRTH2 receptor, and selected anaphylatoxin and chemokines
receptors were determined in recombinant expression systems in vitro. In vivo effects of TM30089
and ramatroban on tissue eosinophilia and mucus cell histopathology were examined in a mouse
asthma model.
Results: TM30089, displayed high selectivity for and antagonistic potency on mouse CRTH2 but
lacked affinity to TP and many other receptors including the related anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a
receptors, selected chemokine receptors and the cyclooxygenase isoforms 1 and 2 which are all
recognized players in allergic diseases. Furthermore, TM30089 and ramatroban, the latter used as
a reference herein, similarly inhibited asthma pathology in vivo by reducing peribronchial
eosinophilia and mucus cell hyperplasia.
Conclusion: This is the first report to demonstrate anti-allergic efficacy in vivo of a highly selective
small molecule CRTH2 antagonist. Our data suggest that CRTH2 antagonism alone is effective in
mouse allergic airway inflammation even to the extent that this mechanism can explain the efficacy
of ramatroban.

Respiratory Research 2007, 8:16 http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/16Background
The small lipid mediator prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is the
major cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid and
is released by activated mast cells in response to allergen
exposure [1]. PGD2 has long been considered a potentially
important mediator in several diseases such as asthma,
allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic conjuncti-
vitis [2-5]. PGD2 elicits biological responses by interaction
with three specific seven-transmembrane receptors,
referred to as DP/DP1, DP2/CRTH2, and TP (DP, D pros-
tanoid receptor; CRTH2, chemoattractant receptor
homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells;
TP, thromboxane A2 receptor) [6-8]. Via interaction with
one (or a combination) of its three specific receptors
PGD2 may contribute to bronchoconstriction, eosi-
nophilia and mucus production in allergic asthma. How-
ever, assessment of actual roles of PGD2 in allergic
diseases has been hampered by its very short biological
half-life and the lack of specific receptor antagonists suit-
able to uncover how signaling of individual PGD2 recep-
tors contribute to disease processes in vivo. It is also
possible that the contribution of PGD2 to allergic airway
inflammation is easily missed if the load of allergen in
challenge studies is too large [9].
CRTH2 is expressed on eosinophils, TH2 cells and
basophils, which are all considered to contribute to the
pathogenesis of allergic diseases [3,10-15]. Several lines of
evidence suggest that activation of CRTH2 in response to
PGD2 mediates recruitment of inflammatory cells in vitro
and in vivo. In vitro, activation of CRTH2 induces chemo-
taxis of TH2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils [7,16]. In
vivo, CRTH2 mediates mobilization of eosinophils from
guinea-pig bone marrow [17], promotes eosinophilia and
exacerbates pathology in mouse models of allergic asthma
and atopic dermatitis [18], and induces eosinophil infil-
tration into the airways upon intratracheal administration
of PGD2 or a selective CRTH2 agonist [19-21]. Based on
evidence supporting a pro-inflammatory role of CRTH2,
this receptor has attracted great interest as a drug target for
therapeutic intervention in allergic diseases. Confusingly,
however, allergic mice that lack a functional CRTH2
receptor and hence are incapable to signal through
CRTH2 have been reported to exhibit both increased [22]
and reduced [23,24] allergic inflammation in models of
asthma [22-24] and atopic dermatitis [23]. These diverg-
ing reports involving gene-deficient animals further
underscore the need to use specific CRTH2 antagonists to
explore the in vivo function of CRTH2.
It was recently reported that ramatroban, which was ini-
tially developed as a TP antagonist and is now used for
treatment of allergic rhinitis in Japan, also displays potent
CRTH2 antagonistic activity [25]. Consistent with this
finding, ramatroban has been shown to abrogate blood
eosinophilia induced by a CRTH2-specific agonist in rats
[19] and to inhibit PGD2-stimulated human eosinophil
migration in vitro [25]. While these data are congruent
with the notion that ramatroban acts through inhibition
of CRTH2 receptors, it is not clear whether its clinical effi-
cacy in allergic rhinitis is due to inhibition of TP, CRTH2
or both receptors. We have recently reported a ramatroban
analog (given internal code number TM30089) with high
antagonistic potency on and selectivity for human CRTH2
and devoid of affinity to the TP receptor [26,27].
Here we report that TM30089 is a highly potent antago-
nist on mouse CRTH2 and lacks affinity to mouse TP in
agreement with its pharmacological properties on the
human receptor orthologs. In addition, this study demon-
strates that TM30089 does not display appreciable affinity
to a range of other receptors and enzymes that have poten-
tially important roles in allergic asthma. Furthermore,
using a mouse model of allergic asthma involving two
allergen challenges, we have discovered that TM30089
similar to ramatroban inhibits allergen challenge-induced
airway tissue eosinophilia and mucus cell hyperplasia.
These in vivo data support the promise of CRTH2 as a tar-
get for treatment of allergic airways diseases.
Methods
In vitro analysis
Cloning and expression of the mouse CRTH2 (mCRTH2) and mouse 
thromboxane A2 (mTP) receptor in HEK293 cells
The coding sequence of mCRTH2 (genbank accession no.
AF054507) was amplified by PCR from mouse hippocam-
pus cDNA and inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression
vector (invitrogen). A HEK293 cell line, stably expressing
mCRTH2 (hereafter referred to as mCRTH2-HEK cells)
was generated under G418 (Gibco #11811) selection and
used as described below in whole cell binding and func-
tional inositol phosphate accumulation assays. The cod-
ing sequence of mTP (genbank accession no. D10849)
was amplified by PCR from mouse spleen cDNA and
inserted into pcDNA3.1(+). HEK293 cells were transiently
transfected with mTP as described [27] and assayed after
48 hr as outlined below.
mCRTH2 and mTP whole cell binding
Binding assays were performed essentially as described
previously [27]. In brief, mCRTH2-HEK cells or HEK cells
transiently transfected with mTP were seeded into white
96 well plates (Costar #3917) at a density of 30.000 cells/
well. About 18–24 hr later, whole cell competition bind-
ing experiments were performed using 0.8 nM [3H]PGD2
(Amersham #TRK734, 166 Ci/mmol) or 0.7 nM
[3H]SQ29548 (PerkinElmer #NET-936, 48.2 Ci/mmol),
for mCRTH2 and mTP respectively. Total and nonspecific
binding were determined in the absence and presence ofPage 2 of 10

Respiratory Research 2007, 8:16 http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/1610 μM PGD2 for mCRTH2 and 10 μM U46619 for mTXA2
receptors.
Inositol phosphate accumulation assays
mCRTH2-HEK or HEK cells transiently transfected with
mTP were seeded at a density of 30.000 cells/well in poly-
D-lysine coated 96-well tissue culture plates and labeled
by overnight incubation in medium containing 5 μCi
myo- [2-3H]-inositol (TRK911, Amersham Biosciences).
After washing, cells were stimulated with the respective
ligands in the presence of 5 mM LiCl (HBSS, GIBCO cat.
14025–050, 45 min, 37°C) and the inositol phosphate
fraction was quantified using a scintillation proximity
assay (SPA) as described previously [28]. To facilitate
inositol phosphate generation by the Gi-selective CRTH2
receptor, mCRTH2-HEK cells were transiently transfected
with a promiscuous Gα protein [29].
TM30089 profiling panel
TM30089 was tested at a final concentration of 10 μM in
either binding or functional assays on several 7TM recep-
tors, and in enzymatic assays on selected enzymes includ-
ing those involved in arachidonic acid metabolism. All
assays were performed using recombinant human recep-
tors and enzymes, and included the appropriate controls
for assay validation. Enzymatic and binding assays, except
for muscarinic binding, were performed by CEREP in vitro
pharmacology profiling services. Full description of meth-
ods and references is available on the CEREP Web site
[30]. Muscarinic binding assays were performed on
mouse brain homogenate (non-selective) or porcine heart
membranes (M2-selective) with 0.2 nM 3H-NMS as a
tracer and atropine as control. Functional assays were per-
formed using recombinant human receptors and
enzymes, and included the appropriate controls for C3a,
C5a, ChemR23 receptors by determining the inhibitory
potency of TM30089 in InsP assays essentially as
described above. For stimulation of C3a, C5a, and
ChemR23 receptors in InsP assays the following agonists
were used: human recombinant C3a (C3a receptor),
human recombinant C5a (C5a receptor), and the non-
apeptide Chemerin (ChemR23).
Data analysis
was performed using the Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad
Software, San Diego) as described previously [27] with the
following exceptions: Binding data from competition
binding assays were normalized to percent of specific
binding of [3H]PGD2 or [3H]SQ29548 and the Ki was then
determined using the Cheng-Prusoff equation Ki = IC50/
(1+L/Kd), where L is the concentration of radioactive lig-
and and Kd is its dissociation constant. For Schild analysis,
global fitting using the Gaddum/Schild competitive inter-
action model was applied after the functional concentra-
tion-response curves for the agonists PGD2 or U46619 in
the absence or presence of various antagonist concentra-
tions were normalized to percent of the maximal response
obtained by agonist alone.
In vivo model of allergic asthma
Animals
Female BALB/c mice about 6 weeks of age (MoB A/S; Ry,
Denmark) were kept in well-controlled animal housing
facilities and fed ad libitum. The study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Committee in Malmoe-Lund, Sweden.
Allergen sensitization and challenge protocol
All groups of mice (n = 10 in each group) were immu-
nized by intraperitoneal (i.p) injections of ovalbumin
(OVA, 10 μg per injection; grade V, Sigma, St Louis, Mo)
absorbed to alum adjuvant (Al(OH)3; Sigma) at day 0 as
described previously [31,32]. Fourteen days after immuni-
zation mice were exposed to aerosolized OVA (1 % wt/
vol) 30 minutes daily for 2 days. Control animals received
saline challenge. Animals were sacrificed 24 hr after the
last allergen challenge by pentobarbital i.p followed by
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue sampling.
In preliminary studies it was ascertained that daily aller-
gen challenges for only a few days sufficed to produce a
significant airway tissue eosinophilia as well as goblet cell
hyperplasia.
Treatment with CRTH2 antagonists in vivo
On days 14 and 15 mice were treated twice daily with
TM30089 and ramatroban (BAY3405), 5 mg/kg orally.
Control animals received vehicle (PBS 10% Tween80).
Drugs were administered 30 minutes before and 4 hr after
each challenge. The dose of ramatroban was selected in
accord with previous reports [20,23]. Furthermore, rama-
troban and TM30089 differ chemically merely by the
move of one carbon atom from the carboxyl side chain in
ramatroban to the sulfonamide nitrogen in TM30089 –
thus they have the same molecular weight and other
important structural features in common – so it is highly
reasonable to assume they will have very similar PK prop-
erties. Hence, based on the additional similarity regarding
CRTH2 antagonism in vitro the same dose of the TM30089
was used in the in vivo part of this study to allow for a
head-to-head comparison.
Staining and quantification of lung tissue eosinophils and mucus-
containing cells
Eosinophils were detected by histochemical visualization
of cyanide-resistant eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity
[33]. In brief, 5 μm cryo sections were incubated for 8 min
at room temperature in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) supple-
mented with 3.3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(60 mg/100 ml; Sigma), 30% H2O2 (0.3 ml/100 ml), and
NaCN (120 mg/100 ml). Slides were then rinsed in tap
water and mounted in Kaisers medium (Merck, Darm-Page 3 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)
Respiratory Research 2007, 8:16 http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/16stadt, Germany). Eosinophils were identified by their dark
brown reaction product and eosinophils were counted
around bronchi using a depth of 120 μm from the epithe-
lial basement membrane and expressed as cells/0.1 mm2
tissue area as previously described [32]. 5 μm cryo sec-
tions were stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS)
and the total number of PAS-positive cells counted and
expressed as cells/mm basement membrane as previously
described [32]. Although the focus in this study was on tis-
sue pathology BAL was also carried out (see below).
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and quantification of luminal cells
Although eosinophils, according to the preliminary stud-
ies, clearly had migrated to the airway tissue the brevity of
present allergen challenge period until termination meant
that the tissue eosinophils had only started to be lost into
the airway lumen. However, it was still of interest to exam-
ine BALF eosinophils to see if drug-induced effects on tis-
sue eosinophilia in part could be due to increased loss of
these cells through migration across the epithelial lining
[34]. BAL was performed via a ligated tracheal cannula
and 1 ml of PBS was allowed to passively enter the lungs
at a pressure of 10 cm H2O, a procedure that is gentle to
the lungs [32]. The obtained BAL-fluid (BALF) from each
animal was immediately centrifuged and the supernatant
frozen for ELISA analysis. The total number of cells was
quantified using a cell sorter (NucleoCounter®, Chemom-
etec A/S, Allerod, Denmark) and 5 × 105 cells cytocentri-
fuged to microscope slides. Differential cell counts were
performed on May-Grünwald Giemsa stained slides and

Results
In vitro pharmacological profile of TM30089 and 
ramatroban
We have recently reported that the ramatroban analog
TM30089 displays high affinity to human CRTH2
(hCRTH2) but completely lacks affinity to the human
thromboxane A2 receptor hTP (TP, T prostanoid receptor),
unlike ramatroban which antagonizes both receptors
equally well [27]. To investigate whether TM30089 repre-
sents a suitable tool compound to explore the role of
CRTH2 in a mouse model of allergic inflammation in vivo,
we cloned the mouse orthologs of CRTH2 and TP and
evaluated TM30089 and ramatroban (as a reference) in
their ability to displace [3H]PGD2 and 3 [H]SQ29548 from
mCRTH2 and mTP, respectively, in competition binding
experiments using human embryonic kidney cells express-
ing the individual receptors. Both compounds displayed
high affinity to mCRTH2 with log pKi= 8.96 ± 0.05 (1.1
nM), for TM30089 and pKi= 8.38 ± 0.05 (4.2 nM) for ram-
atroban (FIG 1A). The affinity of ramatroban in our bind-
ing assay is in good agreement with the reported Ki value
of 28 nM obtained by others in the same expression sys-
tem [35]. In contrast to ramatroban which also displayed
high affinity to mTP (pKi= 8.92 ± 0.05 (1.2 nM)),
TM30089 bound to mTP with only negligible affinity
(pKi= 5.30 ± 0.03 (50.000 nM)). Thus, both compounds
retain their selectivity profile for CRTH2 versus TP on the
mouse receptor orthologs: TM30089 is CRTH2-selective,
while ramatroban is a dual CRTH2/TP ligand (FIG 1A).
To confirm antagonistic efficacy of the compounds their
ability to inhibit cellular signaling of the receptors was
evaluated in a functional second messenger assay (FIG
1B). In agreement with the binding data, TM30089 acts as
a potent antagonist on mCRTH2 (pA2 = 9.15 ± 0.11,
Schild slope = 1.45 ± 0.08) but does not interfere with sig-
naling of mTP, as compared with ramatroban which
potently inhibits cellular signaling of both mCRTH2 (pA2
= 8.08 ± 0.14, Schild slope = 0.94 ± 0.05) and mTP (pA2 =
9.36 ± 0.10, Schild slope = 1.35 ± 0.06) receptors (FIG
1B). To ascertain that in vivo efficacy of TM30089 does not
arise from inhibition of related 7TM receptors such as the
anaphylatoxin receptors C3a and C5a, the chemokine
receptors CCR3 and ChemR23, or the second high affinity
PGD2 receptor DP, it was tested for its affinity or antago-
nistic potency on these receptors (Table 1). Notably,
TM30089 is very selective, exhibiting > 1000-fold prefer-
ence for CRTH2 over DP [26], and lacks affinity to any of
the other tested receptors and also to the two cyclooxyge-
nase isoforms 1 and 2 which are recognized as important
players in allergic airway inflammation [36,37]. Together,
the affinity and selectivity profile of TM30089 suggests
that it may be suited to uncover the in vivo contribution of
CRTH2 in allergic airway inflammation.
In vivo effects of CRTH2 antagonists on asthma-like 
airway histopathology
Mouse models of allergic asthma exhibit some of the car-
dinal histopathological signs of human asthmatic lungs,
most notably eosinophilia and mucus cell hyperplasia
[32,38]. These are also the key features investigated in this
study. Mice were immunized with the allergen (OVA) and
challenged two times by inhalation of aerosolized OVA.
Lung histology was assessed 24 hr after the last challenge.
OVA-challenged mice developed a marked peribronchial
lung tissue eosinophilia (35.5 eosinophils ± 4.7/0.1
mm2) p < 0.0001 compared to saline challenged animals
(1.3 ± 0.3 cells) (FIG 2a). Eosinophilia was accompanied
by a significant increase of mucus cells in the airway
mucosa (88.1 ± 8.8; 3.2 ± 1 cells/mm basement mem-

troban significantly diminished the allergen challenge-
induced peribronchial lung tissue eosinophilia and
mucus cell hyperplasia (FIG 2). Inhibition by both com-
pounds of pathological changes was quantitative and did
not alter the overall pattern of occurrence of eosinophils
and mucus cells in the airway-lung tissues (FIG 2).
Elimination of the airway tissue eosinophils largely occurs
through egression of these cells into the airway lumen
[32,39,40] where they can be retrieved by BAL. As indi-
cated by the BALF eosinophilia (1.0 ± 0.2; 0.02 ± 0.02 %
eosinophils in allergen and saline-challenged animals,
respectively), eosinophils had already started to enter into
the airway lumen about 24 hr after the second allergen
challenge. Both drug treatments tended to reduce BALF
eosinophilia (TM30089 0.5 ± 0.01 %; ramatroban 0.4 ±
0.01 % BALF eosinophils) indicating that the attenuation
of tissue eosinophilia induced by these drugs did not
reflect increased elimination of tissue eosinophils into the
airway lumen.
Discussion
Emerging evidence suggests that PGD2-activation of its
high affinity receptor CRTH2 may be particularly critical
in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic airway inflammation,
since activation by PGD2 of CRTH2 potently stimulates
chemotaxis of eosinophils in vitro and in vivo [7,19-
21,25,41-43]. Herein, we demonstrate that the small mol-
ecule TM30089 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor
of mouse CRTH2 function in vitro, and by using this
antagonist demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of
CRTH2 signaling in vivo suppresses the development of
certain key features characteristic for allergic asthma.
In vitro, TM30089, which is structurally closely related to
ramatroban, was found to bind mouse CRTH2 with
nanomolar affinity and potently inhibit its signaling in
cells overexpressing the receptor. In addition, TM30089
completely lacks affinity to the mouse TP receptor, unlike
ramatroban which represents a dual TP/CRTH2 antago-
nist on both human and mouse receptor orthologs
[25,26] (this study). Furthermore TM30089 in concentra-
tions up to 10 μM did not show significant binding to or
inhibition of selected chemokine receptors, anaphyla-
toxin receptors, the other high affinity PGD2 receptor DP
as well as the cyclooxygenases 1 and 2. Owing to its high
selectivity over all other tested receptors and enzymes, and
the fact that its chemical structure is closely related to ram-
atroban which has proven efficacious in various animal
and human studies of allergic rhinitis and asthma [44-50],
TM30089 emerges a suitable research tool to explore the
contribution of CRTH2-signaling in allergic airway
inflammation in vivo.
We found that administration of TM30089 displayed anti-
inflammatory efficacy in a mouse model of allergic
asthma that mimics some of the major histopathological
features characteristic of human asthma such as eosi-
nophilia and mucus cell hyperplasia [38]. In the present
study we used allergen challenges during only two consec-
utive days which proved to be sufficient for causing goblet
cell hyperplasia as well as a significant accumulation of
eosinophils in airway-pulmonary tissues. More challenges
for more days would have increased the eosinophilia fur-
ther. However, the present model was preferred because it
had been reported that efficacy of interference with PGD2
is dependent on the allergen load [9]. Thus, the marked
protection against allergen-induced asthma observed in
DP-/- mice was completely lost when more than three
allergen challenges were used [9]. It is of note that
although the present number of provocations was low the
load of allergen would still be far greater than the level of
allergens human asthmatics are exposed to.
The present observation of increased BALF eosinophils
agrees with previous data indicating that already during
the build-up of tissue eosinophilia by allergen exposure
these cells begin to be lost into the airway lumen [32]. Yet,
studies resorting exclusively to the determination of BALF
eosinophilia run the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions
about changes in eosinophil numbers in the most impor-
tant locale, the airway-pulmonary tissues. For example,
we and others have previously observed in allergic mice
that drug interventions may inhibit lumen eosinophilia
whilst the tissue eosinophilia remains unchanged or is,
indeed, increased as reviewed in [34]. It was, therefore,
important to note in this study that both drug treatments
tended to reduce BALF eosinophils demonstrating that
increased elimination of these cells into the airway lumen
could not explain the present inhibitory effects of these
drugs on airway tissue eosinophilia. Using TM30089, we
thus unravel that CRTH2-signaling appears integral to the
recruitment of eosinophils to the airways in vivo. So far, it
has only been demonstrated that externally administered
PGD2 is able to induce local eosinophilia in different
models of inflammation [18-21,51], and that CRTH2 is
the cellular mediator for this effect. However, whether
CRTH2 signaling is relevant in a disease paradigm has not
been established to date. The present finding that a small
molecule inhibitor of CRTH2 is effectively attenuating
eosinophil trafficking to the airway tissues hence suggests
that CRTH2 is an important effector in this OVA-induced
asthma model and regulates allergic inflammation in vivo.
Since recruitment of eosinophils to inflammatory sites is
considered a critical parameter in asthma and other aller-
gic diseases [11-13], our findings also highlight the poten-
tial importance of CRTH2 as a novel therapeutic target.Page 7 of 10

Respiratory Research 2007, 8:16 http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/16Interestingly, the selective CRTH2 antagonist TM30089
equals the dual TP/CRTH2 antagonist ramatroban regard-
ing inhibition of eosinophil recruitment in vivo. Rama-
troban has previously not only been shown to attenuate
airway inflammation in guinea pig and mouse asthma
models [45], but also been effective in inhibiting eosi-
nophil infiltration into the nasal mucosa in patients suf-
fering from allergic rhinitis [48]. It remained elusive,
however, whether inhibition of CRTH2 or TP or both
receptors accounted for its anti-inflammatory efficacy in
these studies. Potentially, inhibition by ramatroban of
eosinophil trafficking may be explained by two different
mechanisms: (i) blockade of TXA2-mediated expression of
adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and/or (ii) direct
inhibition of CRTH2-dependent eosinophil migration
[7,52]. The present finding that both, a dual TP/CRTH2
antagonist as well as a selective CRTH2 antagonist are
comparable in their ability to prevent peribronchial eosi-
nophil infiltration in OVA-sensitized mice therefore is
indicative of the notion that exclusive inhibition of
CRTH2 may also be sufficient to prevent eosinophil infil-
tration into the airway tissues in allergic humans. Thus, it
is tempting to speculate that efficacy of ramatroban is
likely related to inhibition of CRTH2 rather than inhibi-
tion of TP both in rodent asthma models and in humans.
Other characteristic features of allergic asthma are mucus
hypersecretion and airway remodeling [3,53]. Mice chal-
lenged by inhalation of aerosolized ovalbumin showed
marked goblet cell hyperplasia, which was significantly
attenuated in animals treated with the dual TP/CRTH2
antagonist ramatroban or the selective CRTH2 antagonist
TM30089. Interestingly, exclusive inhibition of CRTH2 by
TM30089 was equally effective as compared with dual TP/
CRTH2 antagonsim in ameliorating goblet cell hyperpla-
sia. This finding is intriguing since corticosteroids, which
now are mainstay asthma treatment, have variable effects
on suppression of goblet cell hyperplasia [54], and offers
the exciting perspective that selective inhibition of CRTH2
may be beneficial to achieve clinical improvement of
allergic asthma. Further studies are warranted to investi-
gate the molecular basis for the beneficial effects of
CRTH2 antagonists in experimental allergic asthma in
more detail.
Recent reports dealing with CRTH2-deficient mice have
generated a highly inconsistent picture of receptor func-
tion. On one hand, OVA-sensitized mice lacking CRTH2
displayed enhanced occurrence of eosinophils in BALF
[22]. Unfortunately, data on airway tissue eosinophils
were not presented [22]. On the other hand and in appar-
ent contrast, CRTH2-deficient mice from another labora-
tory were protected from bronchial hyperresponsiveness,
and mucus production [24]. Furthermore, from a third
laboratory IgE-mediated skin eosinophilic inflammation
was significantly reduced in CRTH2-deficent mice com-
pared to wild type animals [23]. These latter authors [23]
also reported that they could not confirm the previously
reported increase in lung eosinophilia [22] and they
stated that only further studies including CRTH2 antago-
nists will contribute to final conclusions in this field.
Although the specific contribution of CRTH2 in allergic
inflammation thus is inconsistent in studies using mice
with targeted gene disruption, the findings of the present
study are congruent with the notion that CRTH2 repre-
sents an eosinophilotactic receptor and provide strong
support for the concept that CRTH2-signaling in vivo is an
important molecular step in the pathogenesis of allergic
asthma.
It is intriguing to note that CRTH2 is not only activated by
PGD2 and several of its metabolites the generation of
which is dependent on the enzyme PGD synthase, but
also by products of the arachidonic acid cascade that are
generated independent of PGD2 production. Among the
latter are the TXA2 metabolite 11-dehydro-TXB2, and
PGF2α, that have recently been demonstrated to activate
eosinophils and basophils [43, 55]. The possibility that
CRTH2 can be activated in cellular contexts where PGD
synthase is not present, i.e. in the absence of PGD2 pro-
duction, further corroborates its importance as a regulator
of allergic inflammation and underscores the potential
usefulness of CRTH2 antagonists as anti-asthmatic agents.
Conclusion
Our study is the first to demonstrate efficacy of a small
molecule selective CRTH2 antagonist in an experimental
model of eosinophilic airway inflammation, and indi-
cates that CRTH2-signaling is integral for orchestrating
some of the pathological features characteristic for allergic
asthma such as recruitment of eosinophils and mucus cell
hyperplasia. Although we cannot rule out at present that
inhibition of both TP and CRTH2 may be superior to
obtain clinical efficacy in allergic diseases, our data cer-
tainly suggest that blockade of CRTH2 alone is sufficient
to yield anti-inflammatory efficacy in experimental
asthma, even to the extent that this mechanism may
explain the efficacy of ramatroban. Although the OVA-
induced asthma model does not reproduce all the features
of the human disease, we propose that selective CRTH2
antagonists represent a novel and promising therapeutic
approach to treat allergic asthma and related inflamma-
tory diseases.
