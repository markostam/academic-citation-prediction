A comparative study on the three quantitative methods frequently used in proteomics, 2D DIGE
(difference gel electrophoresis), cICAT (cleavable isotope-coded affinity tags) and iTRAQ (isobaric tags
for relative and absolute quantification), was carried out. DIGE and cICAT are familiar techniques used
in gel- and LC-based quantitative proteomics, respectively. iTRAQ is a new LC-based technique which
is gradually gaining in popularity. A systematic comparison among these quantitative methods has
not been reported. In this study, we conducted well-designed comparisons using a six-protein mixture,
a reconstituted protein mixture (BSA spiked into human plasma devoid of six abundant proteins), and
complex HCT-116 cell lysates as the samples. All three techniques yielded quantitative results with
reasonable accuracy when the six-protein or the reconstituted protein mixture was used. In DIGE,
accurate quantification was sometimes compromised due to comigration or partial comigration of
proteins. The iTRAQ method is more susceptible to errors in precursor ion isolation, which could be
manifested with increasing sample complexity. The quantification sensitivity of each method was
estimated by the number of peptides detected for each protein. In this regard, the global-tagging iTRAQ
technique was more sensitive than the cysteine-specific cICAT method, which in turn was as sensitive
as, if not more sensitive than, the DIGE technique. Protein profiling on HCT-116 and HCT-116 p53 -/-
cell lysates displayed limited overlapping among proteins identified by the three methods, suggesting
the complementary nature of these methods.

Introduction
One main objective of proteomic research is the systematic
identification and quantification of proteins expressed in a
biological system. The standard approaches to proteomics have
been one-/two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or liquid chro-
matography (LC) followed by mass spectrometry. For the gel-
based methods, proteins are separated by pI and/or molecular
weights, detected by staining, and quantified according to
staining intensities. Proteins are then cut out of the gel,
digested, and identified by mass spectrometry. For the LC-
based methods, proteins or peptides are separated by LC
columns, and then detected, identified, and quantified by mass
spectrometry. The goal of earlier proteomics research was
merely the identification and characterization of proteins. The
goal has now extended to quantitative and comparative studies,
thanks to recent advances in chromatography, mass spectrom-
etry, and bioinformatics.
The gel-based method has been the method of choice for
decades, and is still widely practiced. A number of gel-based
methods are commonly employed in quantitative proteomics.
The first and oldest method is based on statistical analysis via
one of the powerful software packages that merge and compare
a number of replicate sets of gels for control and treated
samples. This approach requires several replicate runs to
overcome variations in running gels, and therefore is very
laborious and prone to experimental errors.1 An alternative to
the above protocol is difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE). In
the DIGE method, CyDye fluors that are spectrally resolvable
(e.g., Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5) and matched for mass and charge
are used to covalently modify the - amino group of lysines in
proteins via an amide linkage. Consequently, the same protein
labeled with any of the fluors will migrate to nearly the same
position on a 2D gel. In a typical protocol, the control and
treated samples are separately labeled using different dyes (e.g.,
Cy3 and Cy5, respectively), while a mixture consisting of an
equal amount of the control and treated samples is labeled with
Cy2. The labeled samples are combined and run in a single
2D gel to allow better spot matching and minimize gel-to-gel
variations. Therefore, in principle, a single gel would suffice

for full quantitative analysis. The DIGE method also allows
multiplexing for up to three separate protein mixtures on the
same 2D gel if the third protein sample is labeled with Cy2.
Several papers provide a good review of the DIGE technique.2,3
Other 2D gel methods for quantitative proteomics employ
stable isotope tagging of the Cys residues with light- and heavy-
acrylamide or -vinylpyridine.1 In the past 3 to 4 years, the labor
intensive gel-based techniques have been challenged and
complemented by LC-based methods, particularly in the area
of high-throughput proteomic research. Some of the reasons
behind this trend include issues related to reproducibility,4 poor
representation of low abundant proteins,5 highly acidic/basic
proteins, or proteins with extreme size or hydrophobicity,6 as
well as difficulties in automation of the gel-based techniques.3
The LC-based methods offer flexibility of choosing a wide
range of stationary and mobile phases to resolve complex
biological samples at the protein or peptide level.7,8 In the
multidimensional LC approach, proteins are usually digested
into peptides prior to separation first by cation exchange, and
then with C18 reversed-phase column chromatography. The
advantage of such an approach is that the resolved peptides
from the C18 column can be directly introduced into a mass
spectrometer. Chemical tagging (usually stable isotope labeling)
of proteins/peptides also allows relative quantification of
protein samples by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) analyses. The prototypical stable-isotope labeling for
quantitative proteomics was isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT)
technology.9 Essentially, proteins from the two states to be
compared are labeled at cysteine residues with light and heavy,
respectively, tags carrying a biotin moiety. The labeled proteins
are then mixed and digested. After a cation exchange chroma-
tography step to remove excess reagents, the mixed peptides
are affinity purified using immobilized avidin. Peaks corre-
sponding to the same peptide are identified as doublets in mass
spectra due to the mass difference between light and heavy
isotopes. The peak intensities of the peptides correlate directly
with the relative abundance of the proteins in the two states.
A number of limitations to the prototypical ICAT technique has
been noted in the literature, including missed identification
of proteins with few or no cysteine residue, lost information
for post-translational modifications, differential reversed-phase
elution of identical peptides labeled with the hydrogen/
deuterium isotope pairs, and complicated interpretation of
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra due to the addi-
tion of the biotin group.10,11 Many, but not all of the aforemen-
tioned problems have been solved by the new cleavable ICAT
(cICAT) reagent that employs 13C isotopes and an acid-cleavable
biotin group.12,13 Besides ICAT, other stable isotope coding
techniques applied in quantitative proteomics have been
reported and reviewed.11 Recently a new quantitative method,
isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), was
developed. This technology employs a 4-plex set of amine
reactive isobaric tags to derivatize peptides at the N-terminus
and the lysine side chains, thereby labeling all peptides in a
digest mixture.14 In MS, peptides labeled with any of the
isotopic tags are indistinguishable (isobaric). Upon fragmenta-
tion in MSMS, signature ions (m/z from 114 to 117) are
produced, which provide quantitative information upon inte-
gration of the peak areas.14 In addition to the stable isotope
labeling approach, several researchers have developed alterna-
tive LC-based quantification strategies without any labeling.15,16
Among the different techniques discussed above, DIGE and
ICAT are the two most commonly practiced techniques in gel-
based and LC-based quantitative proteomics, respectively.
iTRAQ is a relatively new technique, but is gaining in popularity
as an alternative to ICAT. Although several recent publica-
tions17,18,19 focused on two-method comparison, a head-to-head
comparison of the three methods has not been reported. Such
a comparison could provide useful information regarding
intrinsic merits and constraints of these methods. In this study,
we conducted carefully designed experiments to compare these
three quantitative methods, with respect to accuracy and
sensitivity toward samples of various complexity.
Materials and Methods
Preparation of Protein Samples. A six-protein mixture
consisting of bovine serum albumin (22 íg), â-galactosidase
(38 íg), R-lactalbumin (10 íg), â-lactoglobulin (24 íg), lysozyme
(10 íg), and apotransferrin (25 íg) was from Applied Biosys-
tems. For each technique studied, one tube containing the
mixture was reconstituted with the solvent appropriate for the
technique. The content was then split into two equal aliquots
for subsequent differential labeling. Human plasma was ob-
tained from a healthy volunteer. A polyclonal antibody affinity
column (Agilent) was used to remove six major proteins (i.e.,
albumin, IgG, IgA, antitrypsin, transferrin, haptoglobin) from
the plasma, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The flow-
through portion (the plasma devoid of the 6 major proteins,
referred hereafter as depleted plasma) was collected and
analyzed with a Finnigan ProteomeX ion trap mass spectrom-
eter to confirm the absence of these six abundant proteins. The
buffer of the depleted plasma was exchanged, using Millipore
Centricon YM-3 (MW cutoff at 3000 Da), to those appropriate
for the respective techniques. Total protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford assay, with bovine serum
albumin (BSA) as the standard. The depleted plasma was not
used as a negative control. Rather, various amounts of BSA were
added into the depleted plasma to obtain two sets of recon-
stituted plasma samples (1 or 3 pmol BSA in 7 íg plasma
proteins; 10 or 30 pmol BSA in 7 íg plasma proteins). The same
levels of BSA were also added to the respective method buffers
as baseline samples. Two HCT-116 cell lines, HCT-116 and
HCT-116 p53-/-, were cultured in 150  20 mm dishes to
around 80% cell confluence. The cells were washed three times
with PBS and scraped into a 1 protease inhibitor cocktail
solution (0.1 M tris/pH 8.0 containing 10 íg/mL aprotinin, 10
íg/mL leupeptin, and 0.2 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride).
The cells were sonicated twice (10 s each) and centrifuged at
13 000  g for 20 min. The supernatant was saved as the cell
lysate. The buffer of cell lysates was exchanged to triethylam-
monium bicarbonate (a volatile buffer) using Millipore Micro-
con YM-10, and the sample was evaporated in a speedvac to
near dryness. The proteins were redissolved in buffers ap-
propriate for respective techniques. For all of the three labeling
methods, 75 íg of lysate proteins from the wild type (HCT-
116) or the mutant (HCT-116 p53 -/-) cells were used.
DIGE and 2D-SDS-PAGE. All chemicals and instruments
used in DIGE and 2D-SDS-PAGE were purchased from Amer-
sham (now GE Healthcare). Samples were separately labeled
with different CyDyes (Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5) unless otherwise
stated. The ratio of protein to CyDye was maintained at 50 íg/
400 pmol. The CyDye labeling only labels approximately 1-2%
of the lysine residues. The labeled mixtures were combined and
loaded onto pH 3-10 NL 24-cm Immobiline Dry Strips (IPG)
for first dimension separation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) for
24 h. The strips were then loaded onto 10-20% gradient or
research articles Wu et al.

12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were run overnight and
then scanned using a Typhoon scanner for the CyDye fluors,
followed by Sypro Rudy staining overnight. An Ettan Spot
Handling Workstation was used for automated spot picking,
in-gel digestion, and spotting onto matrix assisted laser de-
sorption ionization (MALDI) target plates. Spot image analyses
and spot selection were carried out using the Progenesis
Discovery 2005 software (Nonlinear, UK).
cICAT and iTRAQ. The cICAT and iTRAQ reagent kits were
obtained from Applied Biosystems (ABI). Samples were treated
essentially as recommended in the standard manufacturer’s
protocols, except that, in the iTRAQ protocol the final eluates
were concentrated 10-fold to enrich the peptide concentration
and reduce acetonitrile content (originally 25%). To reduce
sample complexity, a strong cation exchange (SCX) chroma-
tography, using an off-line SCX cartridge and buffers supplied
by ABI, was carried out for cell lysate-derived peptides when
the cICAT (6 fractions) or iTRAQ (10 fractions) method was
used.
LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF and Database Search. Peptide sepa-
ration was performed on a Famos/Switchos/Ultimate chroma-
tography system (Dionex/LC Packings) equipped with a Probot
(MALDI-plate spotting device). Individual SCX and/or acid
cleaved avidin-eluted fractions were injected and captured onto
a trap column (PepMap C18, 5 ím, 100 A, 300 ím i.d.  5 mm)
at 10 íL/min. Peptide separation of the BSA-spiked depleted
human plasma or HCT-116 cell lysates was achieved on an
analytical nano-column (PepMap C18, 3 ím, 100 A, 75 ím i.d.
 15 cm) using a gradient of 5 to 60% solvent B in A over 90
min (solvent A: 100% water, 0.1% TFA; solvent B: 80% ACN/
20% water, 0.1% TFA) (TFA: trifluoroacetic acid), 60 to 95%
solvent B in A for 1 min, and then 95% solvent B for 19 min at
a flow rate of 0.16 íL/min. The 6-protein mixture was analyzed
using a shorter gradient (5 to 60% solvent B over 30 min), with
formic acid, instead of TFA, as the mobile phase modifier. The
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) eluant was
supplemented with 5 mg/mL R-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
(in 50/50 ACN/water containing 0.1% TFA) from a syringe
pump at a flow rate of 1 íL/min, and spotted directly onto the
ABI 4700 576-well target plates using the Probot. MALDI-TOF/
TOF data were acquired in batch mode using an ABI 4700
Proteomics Analyzer. The number of precursor peaks for MS/
MS acquisition per spot and S/N filter were set at 5 and 20,
respectively, for DIGE samples; but 3 and 20, respectively, for
the six-protein mixture. The maximum number of peaks per
spot, S/N filter, and spot-to-spot precursor mass tolerance were
10, 40, 200 ppm and 20, 100, 200 ppm, respectively, for cICAT
and iTRAQ samples. The database search criterion was based
on individual ion score (based on MS/MS) g 95% confidence
interval (p < 0.05) for unknown proteins searched against
Swiss-Prot. The differential expression ratios for the proteins
which passed such database search criterion are listed in Table
1.
Results and Discussion
Quantification of a Six-Protein Mixture. All three techniques
were used to quantify a 6-protein sample equally aliquoted into
two tubes for labeling. As shown in Table 1a, all three methods
yielded reasonably good accuracy (between 90% and 112% of
expected values) with a variation of less than 15%. The accuracy
is defined as the acquired ratio divided by the theoretical ratio,
and the relative standard deviation is defined as standard
deviation divided by the average of the ratios for that protein.
A semiquantitative approach based on the number of peptides
detected for each protein has recently been reported.16 The
approach assumes that the more abundant a protein is in the
sample, the greater the chance that it can be detected. The
larger number of peptides detected (Table 1a) by iTRAQ
suggests that iTRAQ is more sensitive than cICAT. The superior
sensitivity of iTRAQ over cICAT may be attributed to two
factors. First, the tagging by iTRAQ reagent is global, while that
by cICAT is cysteine-specific. It has been reported that the
avidin affinity purification steps for biotinated peptides used
in the cICAT protocol recover approximately 10% of the original
peptides.2 Furthermore, not all cysteine-containing peptides
with a biotin group could be captured.20 Second, earlier studies
have shown that peptides that end with an arginine tend to
give a much stronger signal in MALDI-MS analysis than those
that end with a lysine.21-23 The basicity of the guanidino
functionality of the arginine side chain possibly accounted for
better ionization,21 as the conversion of a lysine to a homoargi-
nine also improves ionization.22,23 The iTRAQ tags contain a
moderately strong basic group (N-methylpiperazine), which
likely promotes ionization of lysine-containing peptides in a
way similar to the effect due to a guanidino group.
Table 1a also illustrates a distinctive difference between
cICAT and iTRAQ in that the number of peptides identified by
cICAT is cysteine abundance-dependent, while that by iTRAQ
is not. This is further supported by the correlation coefficients
between the number of cysteine residues and the peptides
identified, as shown in Figure 1. This observation is consistent
with those reported in two previous studies, showing that
proteins with fewer than 8 cysteines were less likely to be
detected (quantified) by the cICAT approach12 and that the
order of abundance among 491 microsomal proteins identified
could be attributed to their cysteine content.24 In the latter
study,24 a significant percentage of the identified proteins which
contain between one and four cysteine residues are abundant
proteins, while those low abundant proteins identified contain
an average of 12-17 cysteine residues. Our results suggest that
global tagging by iTRAQ followed by fractionation, to reduce
sample complexity prior to quantitative analyses, was superior
to the cICAT approach for those which are not particularly
cysteine-rich. Since the total number of peptides in most
proteins is much higher than that of cysteine-containing
peptides, the presence of more cysteines did not seem to
influence the observed superior sensitivity of iTRAQ over cICAT.
The semiquantitative analysis based on the number of
peptides detected was not applicable to the DIGE analysis, as
the number of precursors selected for MS/MS in this gel-based
method was set at 3, instead of 5 for both cICAT and iTRAQ
methods. It should also be pointed out that although the same
amount of protein (129 íg per tube) was labeled, the actual
amounts of peptides introduced into the mass spectrometer
were different in the three methods. For the cICAT or iTRAQ
sample, only a small fraction of the peptides from labeled
proteins was actually analyzed by the LC-MALDI. The mass
limitation was primarily due to the capacities of the trap and
analytical columns used in the LC-MALDI set up. The capaci-
ties of the trap column (PepMap C18, 5 ím, 100 A, 300 ím i.d.
 5 mm) and analytical column (PepMap C18, 3 ím, 100 A, 75
ím i.d.  15 cm) are about 1-10 íg and 1-10 pmol protein
digest, respectively (the 1-10 pmol protein digest is equivalent
to 0.06 to 0.6 íg protein digest for BSA). Therefore, it is
estimated that less than one-tenth the amount of proteins (10
íg vs 129 íg) was actually introduced into the mass spec-

trometer in the two LC-MALDI methods (cICAT and iTRAQ).
The precise estimation is difficult because the extent of mass
transfer of these two LC-MALDI platforms is largely unknown.
For gel samples, all proteins were loaded onto the IPG strip.
The mass transfer of proteins from IPG strip to a 2D gel, and
from gel spots of variable sizes picked with a fix-sized picker
head could only be estimated. Similarly, the mass transfer of
peptides from gel matrix to microtiter plate and from microtiter
plate to MALDI target plate vary among different experiments.
For LC-MALDI methods, peptides from any given protein are
distributed across the plate in multiple spots. The MS/MS
spectra for the precursor ions are acquired from each spot
where their MS signals are most intense in the LC elution
profile. A quantitative evaluation of all the aforementioned
mass transfer efficiencies (or the extents of sample loss) is
difficult and beyond the scope of this study.
Quantification for BSA-Spiked Plasma Protein Mixture. We
next explored the sensitivity and accuracy of the three different
methods using a moderately complex sample, i.e., BSA spiked
into depleted plasma. Various amounts of BSA were added to
7 íg of plasma proteins to obtain two sets of samplessone
contains 1 or 3 pmol BSA; and the other contains 10 or 30 pmol
BSA. The same amounts of BSA were also spiked into buffers
for the respective methods to form baseline samples. On the
basis of the aforementioned column capacities of the trap and
analytical columns (1-10 íg and 1-10 pmol protein digest,
respectively), comparable amounts of proteins (<10 íg even
for the plasma sample with 30 pmol added BSA) were used in
the three different platforms. As demonstrated in Table 1b, all
three techniques yielded accurate quantitative results (between
81% and 122% of expected values) with a variation generally
less than 30%. Under the conditions in this study, iTRAQ
identified more peptides, and thus exhibited a better sensitivity
than cICAT or DIGE, which labels peptides on specific amino
acids. This finding however is contrary to that of a recent report
stating that cICAT identified a higher proportion of lower-
abundance proteins, while iTRAQ resulted in a higher percent-
age of the more abundant proteins.18
Methodological Constraints Associated with the Three
Platforms Revealed by Data Analyses. In the gel-based plat-
form, protein isoforms and comigration of proteins were noted
to affect quantification sensitivity and accuracy, respectively.
From recent 2D gel MS studies, it has been demonstrated that
protein products from one gene may exhibit an average of 10-
15 different spots. The microheterogeneity is attributable to
post-translational modifications, proteolytic degradation, and
other causes.25,26 The current DIGE protocol does not call for
alkylation during the isoelectric focusing (IEF) step. As a result,
spurious multimeric spots, due to “scrambled” disulfide bridges,
could appear in the gels.27 Figure 2a shows the Cy3 spots of
BSA isoforms (1 pmol and 10 pmol in the DIGE baseline
samples, i.e., BSA in method buffer). The “+” signs mark the

corresponding picking spots, which represent only 30% and
28%, respectively, of total spot volumes of the BSA isoforms
for the 1 pmol and 10 pmol BSA baseline samples. The
formation of protein isoforms affects the quantitative study as
they reduce effective mass concentration per spot. The reduced
sensitivity due to microheterogeneity is more problematic in
gel-based platform than the cICAT or iTRAQ platform where
quantification is assessed at the peptide level.
Besides protein isoforms, protein comigration and partial
comigration in 2D gels impose even a greater challenge in
quantification. As illustrated in Figure 2b, the comigration (BSA
and prothrombin precursor, marked by x) and partial comi-
gration (BSA marked by + and â-1B-glycoprotein marked by
‡) negatively impact the accuracy of quantification. In one
study, it has been shown that more than one-third (17 out of
50) of protein spots in a 2D gel contain 2 or more proteins.5 In
the extreme case, one spot was found to contain 6 proteins
with molecular weight and pI ranging from 47.9 KDa to 67.7
KDa and 5.09 to 5.45, respectively.5 The comigration of multiple
proteins into a single spot renders comparative quantification
rather inaccurate. For partially comigrated proteins, com-
mercially available spot detection software is not robust enough
to identify unambiguously the boundaries of spots, while
manual quantification is predisposed to errors caused by
subjectivity in drawing spot boundaries. In a recent study
comparing DIGE with metabolic labeling of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae proteins, all 20 spots selected in the DIGE gel for
comparative evaluation contain a single protein,17 illustrating
that accurate quantification by DIGE (and thus its comparative
evaluation to other technique) works best where one single
protein is present in one spot.
In the LC-based platform, the cICAT technique appears to
be at least as sensitive as the DIGE method, based on the
number of peptides identified. Similar to the results from the
six-protein mixture, iTRAQ method displays a higher sensitivity
than the cICAT technique. Despite this, a potential pitfall
unique to MALDI-TOF TOF platform that may affect quanti-
fication accuracy should be mentioned. Since labeling by the
iTRAQ reagent is global and its quantification relies on daughter
ions generated during MS/MS, the amounts of the precursor
ion and others within the set mass window may contribute to
the quantification ratio. The MALDI-TOF/TOF used in this
study routinely achieves precursor ion selection using between
30 -200 mass resolution in the dual gate timed-ion selector
(TIS). The use of a higher resolution (e.g., 200) reduces the
intensities of fragmented ions; whereas the use of a lower
resolution (e.g., 30) compromises the selectivity of the precursor
ion. Thus, the setting of the resolution is a tradeoff between
sensitivity and selectivity. In this iTRAQ study, the precursor
mass window was adjusted to 100 resolution, as suggested in
ABI’s iTRAQ Chemistry Reference Guide. This provides a good
combination of sensitivity and selectivity, and translates into
10 Da full width at half-maximum height (fwhm) mass window
for an ion of 1000 Da. To illustrate the effect of TIS resolution
on quantification accuracy, Figure 3 exhibits three mass spectra
from the BSA-spiked plasma samples. An ideal situation, in
which quantification ratio is attributed to a single dominant
peak (1624.1 Da) without major interfering ions in the precursor
mass window, is shown in Figure 3a. Most of the quantification
ratios of BSA-spiked plasma samples reported in Table 1b fall
in this category (24 out of 28). Figure 3b demonstrates an ion
of interest with sufficiently high signal intensity but interfered
by another ion peak within 100 resolution. Following manual
adjustment of the TIS to 200 with concomitant signal loss of
MS/MS ions, the peptide could still be accurately quantified
and identified with a high score. Figure 3c depicts a situation
in which a tighter resolution could not well resolve the ion of
interest from others. There were also cases that a tighter
resolution yielded lower ion scores, presumably due to a
reduced MS/MS ion intensity. The extent of such interference
depends largely on the sample type and its complexity. It
should be pointed out that the interference of precursor ion
selection by neighboring ions is common to commercial mass
spectrometers, though to different degrees depending on how
ions are isolated. Emerging newer designs are expected to
alleviate this problem, as indicated in a recent report that newer
TOF/TOF optics provides improved resolving power by a factor
of 3 for precursor selection in MS/MS mode.28 It should be
noted that iTRAQ labeled samples could also be analyzed on
Q-TOF or Q-TRAQ types of mass spectrometers, although no
similar problem associated with the precursor ion selection was
reported.14,18 In contrast to iTRAQ technique, quantification
accuracy using cICAT and DIGE methods are not affected by
the precursor mass window limitation, as the quantification
of cICAT is at the MS level, whereas DIGE quantification is
based on fluorescence.

116 p53 -/- were used. As expected, the abundance of the
majority of proteins did not change significantly between the
two cell lysate samples. Table 1c summarizes those proteins
which were found to change (50% or more in abundance. A
total of 32 proteins were identified by the three methods, based
on a 95% confidence interval.
Of the 23 proteins identified using the iTRAQ technique, 10
contain fewer than 5 cysteine residues and therefore were not
revealed by the cICAT method. Similarly, 8 of the 23 proteins
have their pI or MW outside the ranges of the IPG strip and
polyacrylamide gel used in this study (pH 3-10 or 14-100K,
respectively), and thus were not detected by the DIGE method.
Surprisingly, only one protein (triosephosphate isomerase) was
identified by all three techniques. Three proteins (Heat shock
protein HSP 90-beta, Galectin-1, and triosephosphate isomerase)
were identified by both iTRAQ and cICAT methods, while one
protein (triosephosphate isomerase) was commonly identified
by iTRAQ and DIGE methods. The finding is similar to that
reported in a recent publication comparing cICAT and iTRAQ
showing only one differentially expressed protein was identified
by both cICAT (6 proteins) and iTRAQ (5 proteins) methods
using endometrial tissue homogenates.18 It should be empha-
sized that the focus of this study is on method comparison,
and no attempts were made to maximize the number of
differentially expressed proteins.
The results suggest that the information generated by each
of the three methods is complementary in nature, which could
result from different ways of experimental procedures and
sample preparation. Some proteins or peptides may be better
resolved and/or represented in one method, but not in another.
Assuming that protein denaturation fully exposes all sites for
labeling, the expression ratio should be the similar regardless
of whether the method is residue-specific or global (N termi-
nal). However, no denaturant has been proven to be universally
useful for unbiased labeling. This is further complicated by the
fact that different denaturants are recommended for the three
methods, adding another variable for preferential unmasking
or blocking of reactive sites on different amino acid residues.
The iTRAQ labeling chemistry, capable of labeling the N termini
of peptides, offers a greater tolerance to any steric hindrance
effect associated with labeling. An apparent advantage of the
iTRAQ method is that it could label peptides whose sites may
otherwise not be accessible to CyDye or cICAT reagents at the
protein level. A disadvantage unique to iTRAQ is that samples
for iTRAQ labeling need to be processed separately up to tryptic
digestion. This could introduce potential sources of errors such
as in sample handling or variable degrees of tryptic digestion
between two samples. Ensuring consistent sample preparation
in the iTRAQ method is therefore critically important.
Summary
We have shown that the three proteomic quantitative
methods, iTRAQ, 2D DIGE, and cICAT, yielded reasonably good
results when applied to a relatively simple or moderately
complex sample. In the 2D-gel DIGE approach, comigration
and partial comigration of proteins could compromise the
accuracy of quantification. This problem should not be over-
looked when quantification is intended for nonabundant
proteins in complex samples. The cICAT is at least as sensitive
as the DIGE method, but is cysteine-content biased. The iTRAQ
method is most sensitive, but occasionally suffers from an
inherent problem associated with the timed-ion selector reso-
lution of the MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument. Manual examina-
tion of MS spectra will improve the quantification accuracy for
complex samples. There is a limited overlap of differentially
expressed proteins identified by the three methods from two
closely related HCT-116 cell lines, suggesting the complemen-
tary nature of these three methods. Future improvement in
instrumentation sensitivity, labeling chemistry, and chroma-
tography is clearly needed to enable routine quantification of
proteins/peptides by mass spectrometry Nevertheless, the
complementary information obtained through different meth-
ods should potentially provide a better portrait of the biological
system under investigation.
