ABSTRACT
The nucleolar protein Pes1 interacts with Bop1
and WDR12 in a stable complex (PeBoW-complex)
and its expression is tightly associated with cell
proliferation. The yeast homologue Nop7p (Yph1p)
functions in both, rRNA processing and cell cycle
progression. The presence of a BRCT-domain
(BRCA1 C-terminal) within Pes1 is quite unique for
an rRNA processing factor, as this domain is
normally found in factors involved in DNA-damage
or repair pathways. Thus, the function of the BRCT-
domain in Pes1 remains elusive. We established
a conditional siRNA-based knock-down-knock-in
system and analysed a panel of Pes1 truncation
mutants for their functionality in ribosome synthesis
in the absence of endogenous Pes1. Deletion of the
BRCT-domain or single point mutations of highly
conserved residues caused diffuse nucleoplasmic
distribution and failure to replace endogenous Pes1
in rRNA processing. Further, the BRCT-mutants of
Pes1 were less stable and not incorporated into the
PeBoW-complex. Hence, the integrity of the BRCT-
domain of Pes1 is crucial for nucleolar localization
and its function in rRNA processing.
INTRODUCTION
Ribosome biogenesis is the major metabolic challenge of
rapidly proliferating cells, in particular tumour cells. How-
ever, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that
ensure the equilibrium between cell division and ribosome
biogenesis required for balanced cell proliferation and thus
a successful duplication of the translational machinery (1).
Recently it has become evident that ribosome synthesis is
cell cycle controlled and sensitive to growth factor and nutri-
ent signalling, and inhibited upon stress signals (2–6). On the
other hand, disturbance of the structural and/or functional
integrity of the nucleolus is linked to the induction of the
tumour suppressor p53 (7–10). Several ribosomal proteins
have been identified so far as crucial mediators of the ribo-
somal stress response. Impaired ribosome synthesis decreases
the demand and thereby results in an accumulation of free
ribosomal proteins, such as L11, L5 and L23 that have
been shown to inhibit the function of Mdm2 (11–14). p53
is targeted by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 for proteasomal
degradation. Thus, ribosomal stress mediates the accumula-
tion of p53 by blocking its degradation. A profound knowl-
edge of the mammalian ribosome synthesis pathways is
required to further unravel the ribosomal stress response, a
promising target for non-genotoxic p53 induction in tumour
cells. Fortunately, ribosome biogenesis is a highly evolution-
ary conserved process that has been intensively studied in
yeast (15). In addition, the recent characterization of the
human nucleolar proteome further facilitates the investigation
of mammalian ribosome biogenesis (16–18).
The nucleolar protein Pes1 (Pescadillo) is evolutionarily
highly conserved and essential for embryogenesis and nucle-
ologenesis in mice (19). Its expression is tightly associated
with cell proliferation and thus highly elevated in tumour
cells (20). Two studies have addressed the function of Pes1
in cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis (21,22). Either
transposon mediated insertion mutants or truncations of
the N-terminal or C-terminal region resulted in a dominant-
negative phenotype, blocking processing of the 32S pre-
rRNA and cell proliferation. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is
synthesized as a large 47S precursor that is subsequently
cleaved into the mature 5.8S, 18S and 28S rRNA. Pes1 inter-
acts with two other nucleolar proteins Bop1 and WDR12 in a
stable complex, termed PeBoW-complex (8). Both factors are
also implicated in the processing of ribosomal RNA (8,23). In
yeast, a stable trimeric complex of the respective homologues
of Pes1 (Nop7p/Yph1p), Bop1 (Erb1p) and WDR12 (Ytm1p)
has been identified (24–26). Further, it was shown that the
yeast Pes1 homologue Nop7p (Yph1p) functions in DNA rep-
lication independently of ribosome biogenesis (27). In this

study, Nop7p was co-purified with the origin recognition
proteins Orc1p and Orc2p and required for S-phase entry sub-
sequently to the release from a hydroxyurea mediated
cell cycle arrest. The presence of a BRCT-domain (BRCA1
C-terminal) within the central region of Pes1 is conserved
throughout evolution and remarkable for several reasons.
The BRCT-domain has been first identified as target of germ-
line mutations in the BRCA1 protein, that predispose to the
early development of breast and ovarian cancer (28).
BRCT-domain containing factors, such as BRCA1, XRCC1
and 53BP1 play a role in DNA-damage or repair pathways.
Based on recent structural studies, the BRCT-domain is
thought to function as phosphopeptide recognition motif
(29,30). A bioinformatic analysis of the nucleolar proteome
reveals only a few BRCT-domain containing factors, but hav-
ing all a confirmed role in DNA-damage or replication (http://
Lamondlab.com/NOPdb/). Thus, the presence of a BRCT-
domain within the Pes1 protein is therefore quite unusual if
not unique for an rRNA processing factor. In this study, we
established a conditional siRNA mediated knock-down-
knock-in system to analyse the function of Pes1 truncation
mutants in rRNA processing in the absence of a dominant-
negative phenotype. An extended deletion the BRCT-domain
resulted in aberrant nucleoplasmic localization, however only
in the context of the full-length protein, and failed to recon-
stitute for the endogenous protein in rRNA processing assays.
To study the role of the BRCT-domain more in detail, we
inserted single point mutations of highly conserved residues.
We found that the BRCT-domain of Pes1 is essential for
rRNA processing and nucleolar localization in a context
dependent manner. Moreover, point mutations of the BRCT-
domain reduce the stability of Pes1 and abolish its interaction
with the PeBoW-complex.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning/plasmids
Conditional Pes1 expression constructs and mutagenesis were
described previously (21). The novel Pes1 mutants M9 and
M10 were generated by the use of restriction sites. Single
point mutations of the BRCT-domain were introduced by
site directed mutagenesis. Successful mutagenesis was veri-
fied by sequencing. Pes1 mutants were then cloned into the
pRTS-1 vector using the SfiI restriction site (31).
Tissue culture
H1299 lung carcinoma cells (non-small cell lung carcinoma)
were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 8% CO2. Poly-
clonal cell lines were generated by transfection of the respec-
tive pRTS-1 plasmids using Polyfect (QIAGEN) and stably
selected in the presence of 200 mg/ml hygromycin B for
10 days. Conditional gene expression was induced with
0.5 mg/ml doxycycline and monitored by determining the
percentage of eGFP expressing cells using FACS analysis.
Knock-down-knock-in assay
H1299 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml doxycycline to acti-
vate expression of Pes1wt and the respective mutants for
3 days. Depletion of endogenous Pes1 was performed by
two subsequent transfections of siRNA oligos specific for
the 30-untranslated region (30-UTR) (50-CCAGAGGACCU-
AAGUGUGAtt-30) of the Pes1 mRNA using oligofectamine
(QIAGEN). Cells were harvested for western blot analysis
or metabolic labelling of nascent rRNA at 48 h after the
last siRNA transfection.
Metabolic labelling of nascent rRNA
H1299 were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM/10% FBS
for at least 30 min prior to the in vivo labelling. Cells were
then incubated for 1 h with 15 mCi/ml 32P-orthophosphate.
Subsequently, the metabolic labelling medium was removed
and cells were then further cultured in regular DMEM/10%
FBS for 4–5 h. Total RNA was then isolated using the
RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). A total of 1.5 mg of total
RNA was separated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and
subsequently dried on a whatman paper using a regular gel
drier (BioRad) connected to a vacuum pump. Metabolically
labelled RNA was visualized by autoradiography.
Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
Cells were directly lysed with 2· SDS-loading buffer
(100 mM Tris–HCl, 200 mM DTE, 4% SDS, 10 mM
EDTA, 0.2% bromphenol blue and 20% glycerol). Cell
lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE and blotted on nitro-
cellulose membranes (Amersham). Immunodetection was
performed with monoclonal antibodies directed against the
HA-tag (3F10; Roche), Pes1 (8E9) and tubulin (Dianova).
The monoclonal antibody against human Pes1 was described
previously (8). The antibody against rodent Bop1 was pro-
duced by simultaneous immunization of guinea pigs with
ovalbumin conjugated peptides specific for 6–30 and
541–566 amino acids of mouse Bop1. The polyclonal
serum was only reactive against the N-terminal 6–30 amino
acids. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on cover
slides, fixed with ice-cold methanol and air dried. Unspecific
binding was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/
10% FBS. HA-tagged forms of Pes1 and WDR12 were
detected with the anti-HA (3F10) antibody. Primary antibod-
ies were incubated over night at 4C in a humidified chamber.
Cy3 labelled secondary antibodies (Dianova) were incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI (Sigma–Aldrich). Digital images were acquired using
the Openlab acquisition software (Improvision) and a Zeiss
Axiovert 200 M microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging)
with a 63 (1.15) plan oil objective connected to a CCD-
camera (Hamamatsu, ORCA-479).
Immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitations, H1299 cells were seeded at sub-
confluent density and treated with 0.5 mg/ml doxycycline
for 24 h. Cells were harvested by trypsination and washed
three times with PBS. Subsequently, cells were resuspended
in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1% NP-40,
150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitors and phosphatase
inhibitors] and incubated on ice for 20 min and sonicated.
In the meanwhile protein G beads were incubated either
with antibodies against the HA-tag (3F10, Roche), WDR12
(1B8), Bop1 (6H11) or cytohesin for at least 1 h at 4C.

cytohesin were described previously (8). After centrifugation,
cell lysates were incubated with protein G beads at 4C over
night. Finally, the beads were washed three times with lysis
buffer and resuspended in SDS-loading buffer/lysis buffer
(1:1). The resuspension volume was equal to the volume of
the cell lysates initially used for the IP.
Native gel electrophoresis
A total of 3 · 106 cells were lysed in 100 ml lysis buffer
[50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, phos-
phatase inhibitors and protease inhibitors] at 4C for 20 min.
Total cell lysates were briefly vortexed several times in
between. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation in an
Eppendorf FA-24-11 rotor at 24 000g for 10 min at 4C.
7.5 ml of 2· sample buffer [125 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8),
30% glycerol and 0.02% bromophenol blue] was added to
7.5 ml of total lysate and separated by PAGE (6.5%) in the
absence of SDS at 4C. Blotting was performed in the
absence of methanol. Immunoblotting was performed as
described above.
RESULTS
Functional analysis of Pes1 mutants by
a knock-down-knock-in assay
Previously, we have analysed a set of truncation mutants of
human Pes1 for dominant-negative phenotypes in rRNA pro-
cessing and cell proliferation assays (Figure 1A). Thereby we
identified two mutants, a N-terminal (M1) and a C-terminal
(M5) truncation, that impaired rRNA processing and cell
cycle progression (21). The respective regions were also
found as hotspots for the generation of dominant-negative
mutants using transposon mediated mutagenesis (22). In
this study we extended the panel of mutants by two novel
truncated forms of Pes1, namely M9 and M10. Nomenclature
was preserved to facilitate crossreading with our previous
study (21).
So far it remained unclear whether all the other deletion
mutants were still functional in rRNA processing, in particu-
lar the ones that localized to nucleolus as the wild-type pro-
tein. Pes1 is composed of several distinct domains and little is
known about their role in rRNA processing (Figure 1A).
Therefore we established a conditional knock-down-knock-
in system for mammalian cells (Figure 1B). Briefly, H1299
human lung carcinoma cells were stably transfected with
pRTS-1 constructs, conditionally expressing the respective
HA-tagged forms of human Pes1 in a doxycycline dependent
manner (21,31). Exogenous gene expression was activated for
three days and then maintained throughout the subsequent
course of two siRNA transfections using siRNA oligos
directed against the 30-UTR of the Pes1 mRNA to specifically
deplete the endogenous Pes1 protein. We used H1299 cells,
because stable polyclonal cell cultures could be easily propa-
gated following transfection of the pRTS-1 plasmids and con-
ditional gene expression could be achieved in >95% of the
cells (Supplementary Figure 1). A bidirectional promoter
drives transcription of eGFP at the same time as the indicated
forms of Pes1 and thus allowed easy monitoring by FACS
analysis. Efficient knock-down of the endogenous Pes1
protein was verified by western blot analysis 2 days after
the last siRNA transfection (Figure 1C). The various Pes1
mutants were detected by antibodies directed against the
HA-tag and the C-terminal region of Pes1. The mutants
were detected at the expected size, however deletion of the
acidic regions in M5, M6 and M10 facilitated faster migra-
tion. The Pes1 specific antibody did not recognize the
mutants M5, M10 and M7, as they lacked the respective
epitope. The enlarged panel at the bottom shows the size-
dependent discrimination of the HA-tagged wild-type and
the endogenous Pes1 protein. Including the 3 days of pre-
activation, the various Pes1 mutants were expressed for
7 days when finally harvested. Thus, the different expression
levels of the indicated forms of Pes1 reflect steady-state lev-
els that depend on the respective protein stability. In particu-
lar, M2, M4 and M9 are poorly expressed despite identical
induction rates as monitored by FACS analysis (Supplemen-
tary Figure 1). Interestingly, the steady-state expression of the
HA-tagged wild-type Pes1 closely resembled the levels of the
endogenous Pes1, thus providing a knock-down-knock-in
system at physiological expression conditions.
The acidic domain of Pes1 is dispensable for
rRNA processing
In parallel to the western blot analysis, rRNA processing
was investigated by in vivo labelling of nascent rRNA using
32P-orthophosphate (Figure 2). Ribosomal RNA is transcribed
as a large 47S precursor that is subsequently cleaved into the
mature rRNA forms. Figure 2A depicts an overview of mam-
malian rRNA processing pathways. 32P-orthophosphate is
incorporated into the nascent rRNA transcripts and thus
allows an in vivo analysis of rRNA processing. The 45S and
the 32S rRNA are the most abundant precursor rRNAs,
besides the mature 18S and 28S forms. Expression of
Pes1wt-HA but not WDR12wt-HA completely rescued the
abrogated production of mature 28S rRNA mediated by
depletion of endogenous Pes1 (Figure 2B, lanes 1–4). As
the HA-tagged wild-type Pes1 was fully functional in terms
of rRNA processing, we now tested the whole panel of Pes1
mutants. The majority of the mutants failed to compensate for
depletion of endogenous Pes1. However, M6 and M8 fully
restored the synthesis of the mature 28S rRNA (Figure 2B,
lanes 17, 18 and 21, 22). As M6 lacks the C-terminal acidic
region, this domain is dispensable for rRNA processing.
This is intriguing, as the acidic domain of Pes1 is preserved
throughout evolution and similar stretches of acidic residues
are frequently found in nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin
and nucleophosmin. Several studies provided evidence that
these acidic regions might be important for protein–protein
interactions (32,33). M8 harbors a point mutation of the
potential SUMOylation site of Pes1, however SUMOylation
at this site has not been experimentally confirmed yet.
Interestingly, all mutants lacking the BRCT-domain were
incapable to substitute for endogenous Pes1.
Role of the BRCT-domain for subcellular
localization of Pes1
Analysis of the subcellular localization by indirect immuno-
fluorescence revealed that M9, missing the BRCT-domain,
was dispersed in the nucleoplasm (Figure 3A), as described
previously (21). Further, deletions within the Pes1 protein

(M4 and M10) partially or completely restored nucleolar
localization [Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 2 and (21)].
Thus, lack of the BRCT-domain results in a diffuse nucleo-
plasmic distribution in a context dependent manner. However,
the isolated BRCT-domain of Pes1 (Pes1 BRCT) was diffusely
distributed in the cytoplasm and therefore insufficient for
nuclear/nucleolar localization (Figure 3A). M6, harbouring
the deletion of the acidic region, localized to the nucleolus

as the wild-type protein [Supplementary Figure 2 and (21)].
This observation is in line with its full functionality in the
rRNA processing assay. The presence of the BRCT-domain
within the Pes1 protein is conserved throughout evolution,
from yeast to human. In Figure 3 we have shown that it
is crucial for the nucleolar localization of Pes1, but only
in the context of the full-length protein, as the highly con-
served N-terminal region (M10) was sufficient for nucleolar
localization. However, a gross deletion of the BRCT-domain
including adjacent residues might affect overall stability
and protein folding. Therefore, we generated a set of single
point mutations of highly conserved residues within the
BRCT-domain (Figure 3B). W397 is one of the most con-
served amino acids corresponding to the missense muta-
tion W1837R in the BRCT-domain of BRCA1. Analogous
exchanges of W397R, I347R and F327R in the yeast Pes1
homologue Nop7p (Yph1p) resulted in temperature sensitive
strains (20,27). So far, no temperature sensitive alleles were
isolated in yeast that would correspond to the R380W
exchange.
We then investigated the subcellular localization of the
respective mutant forms by indirect immunofluorescence
(Figure 3C). Pes1-W397R and -F327R exhibited a diffuse
nucleoplasmic distribution. Pes1-I347R was also dispersed
in the nucleoplasm, however a small percentage of the cells
also displayed nucleolar enrichment. Pes1-R380W predomi-
nantly localized in the nucleolus, but the intensity of the
nucleoplasmic staining was slightly increased in comparison
to Pes1wt. Thus, the integrity of the BRCT-domain is crucial
for proper nucleolar localization of Pes1, and notably, either
deletion or critical point mutations of the BRCT-domain
resulted in aberrant nucleoplasmic distribution.
Point mutations within the BRCT-domain of Pes1
abrogate its functionality in rRNA processing
Subsequently, we analysed the functionality of the BRCT-
mutants in terms of rRNA processing. We depleted the cells
for endogenous Pes1 and performed in vivo labelling of nascent
ribosomal RNA to test the capacity of the respective mutants to
sustain production of the mature 28S rRNA. In analogy to
Figure 2, the HA-tagged Pes1wt was fully functional in our
assay (Figure 4A, lanes 1–4). In contrast, the predominantly
nucleoplasmic BRCT-mutants Pes1-W397R, -I347R and
F327R failed to substitute for depletion of endogenous Pes1
(Figure 4A, lanes 5–8 and 11–12). Only the nucleolar Pes1-
R380W mutant rescued maturation of the 28S rRNA. For
western blot analysis, cells were harvested in parallel to the
in vivo labelling (Figure 4B). Noteworthy, the non-functional
BRCT-domain mutants Pes1-W397R, -I347R, -F327R dis-
played lower steady-state expression levels than Pes1wt or
the functional Pes1-R380W mutant, even though the percent-
age of ectopic Pes1 expressing cells was equal as determined
by detection of eGFP using flowcytometry (Supplementary
Figure 3). Successful knock-down of the endogenous Pes1
was verified by using an antibody directed against Pes1
(Figure 4B). As this antibody recognizes the endogenous and
exogenous forms of Pes1, the expression of the respective
mutants can be analysed in the context of the endogenous
Pes1 levels. The non-functional nucleoplasmic BRCT-domain
mutants were expressed at significant lower levels than the
endogenous Pes1, whereas Pes1wt and Pes1-R380W closely
mimicked the physiological expression levels.
Point mutations within the BRCT-domain
of Pes1 negatively affect protein stability
Thus, we reasoned that the lower protein expression levels of
the non-functional BRCT-domain mutants might result from
decreased protein stability. Therefore we inhibited proteaso-
mal degradation by treating the cells with MG-132 for 8 h.
Indeed, the non-functional BRCT-domain mutants exhibited
a more pronounced accumulation than Pes1wt and Pes1-
R380W (Figure 5A). Further, proteasome inhibition resulted
in the occurrence of multiple bands with higher molecular
weight strongly suggesting that Pes1 and the respective
BRCT-domain mutants become polyubiquitinated. We also
analysed the panel of Pes1 truncation mutants for the occur-
rence of polyubiquitination to further map the ubiquitination
site. However, all mutants tested so far exhibited signs of
polyubiquitination (data not shown). Thus, we concluded
that several lysines within different regions of Pes1 might
serve for ubiquitination to mediate subsequent proteasomal
degradation. Incubation with ALLM, an inhibitor of calpain
and cathepsin proteases, had no effect on the protein levels
of the BRCT-domain mutants (Figure 5A). Our attempts to
analyse whether proteasome inhibition mediated accumula-
tion of the BRCT-domain mutants restored functionality
were hampered by the fact that proteasome inhibitors
itself potently abrogated rRNA processing (Supplementary
Figure 4).
Next, we analysed the stability of the Pes1 BRCT-domain
mutants by treating the cells with cyclohexamide to block
de novo protein synthesis (Figure 5B). Expression levels of
Pes1wt and Pes1-R380W remained unchanged over 12 h in
the presence of cyclohexamide. However, the non-functional
mutants Pes1-W397R, -I347R and -F327R rapidly decreased
within several hours in the absence of de novo protein synthe-
sis. In conclusion, mutations of highly conserved residues
within the BRCT-domain of Pes1 negatively affect protein
stability and cause aberrant nucleoplasmic localization.
Thus it might be that incorporation of Pes1 mutants into

Figure 5. Stability of Pes1 BRCT-domain mutants and incorporation into the PeBoW-complex. (A) Stable polyclonal H1299 cells conditionally expressing wt
WDR12, wt Pes1 and the indicated Pes1 BRCT-domain mutants were either left untreated or incubated with MG-132 or ALLM for 8 h. Total cell lysates were
harvested and analysed by western blot analysis using the anti-HA antibody (3F10). Equal loading was verified by immunodetection for a-tubulin. (B) Cells were
treated with 50 mg/ml cyclohexamide for the indicated time points to block de novo protein synthesis. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates was performed
using the anti-HA antibody (3F10). Immunodetection of a-tubulin is shown as loading control. (C) Incorporation of Pes1 BRCT-domain mutants into the
PeBoW-complex. H1299 cells stably transfected with the indicated constructs were treated with doxycycline for 48 h to induce expression of the respective
proteins. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations with antibodies either directed against the HA-tag (3F10), WDR12 (1B8), Bop1 (6H11) or the
isotype control (cytohesin). Equivalent amounts of total lysates used for immunoprecipitations were loaded in each lane or 20% thereof for the input.
Immunodetection was performed using the anti-HA antibody. (D) Total cell lysates of stably transfected H1299 cells expressing HA-tagged wild-type Pes1 or the
indicated mutant together with HA-tagged rodent Bop1 were separated by native gel electrophoresis. Immunodetection was perfomed using antibodies specific
for the HA-tag and rodent Bop1. Denaturing gel electrophoresis and HA-tag immunodetection was performed to control expression levels.

the nucleolar PeBoW-complex (Pes1, Bop1 and WDR12) is
crucial for their stability.
Point mutations within the BRCT-domain of Pes1
prevent its incorporation into the PeBoW-complex
Therefore, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies
using antibodies specific for the HA-tag, WDR12, Bop1 and
cytohesin, as an isotype control (8,21). Immunodetection
was carried out using the HA-tag antibody to test whether
the Pes1 BRCT-domain mutants could be co-precipitated
with antibodies directed against the two other endogenous
PeBoW-components, Bop1 and WDR12 (Figure 5C). Indeed,
Pes1wt and Pes1-R380W efficiently co-precipitated with Bop1
and WDR12. However, the nucleoplasmic mutants Pes1-
W397R, -I347R and -F327R were not detected in the respec-
tive immunoprecipitations. In a previous study, the region of
Pes1 required for the interaction with Bop1 was identified by
a yeast-two-hybrid assay and localized in the N-terminal
region (200 amino acids) and therefore distant from the
BRCT-domain (22). A recent study also demonstrated that
the N-terminal region of Pes1 is sufficient and essential for
in vitro interaction with Bop1 (34). Importantly, a Pes1 mutant
harbouring a deletion of the BRCT-domain (corresponding
to the nucleoplasmic mutant M9 of our study) precipitated
in vitro translated Bop1 as efficiently as wild-type Pes1 in
glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull down assays. These
experiments suggested that deletion or point mutations of the
BRCT-domain only play a critical role for the Pes1–Bop1
interaction under in vivo conditions. Aberrant nucleoplasmic
localization is one possible mechanism that may prevent
in vivo interaction with endogenous Bop1. However, additio-
nal mechanisms may contribute in vivo as well. As endogenous
Bop1 might be rate limiting for Pes1–Bop1 complex formation
we analysed complex assembly by native gel electrophoresis
upon enforced expression of Pes1 and Bop1. Wild-type Pes1
and Pes1-R380W efficiently formed a stable complex with
Bop1 under these conditions. However, either deletion or the
other point mutations of the BRCT-domain abrogated complex
formation (Figure 5D). Thus, deletion or critical point muta-
tions of the BRCT-domain of Pes1 prevent its interaction
with the endogenous PeBoW-components in vivo, whereas
its physical interaction with Bop1 under in vitro conditions
apparently remains unaffected, as recently shown.
DISCUSSION
Several recent studies have underlined the importance of the
nucleolus in sensing cellular stress (2,7,11,14). The tremen-
dous metabolic challenge of ongoing ribosome biogenesis is
controlled by growth factor and stress signalling cascades,
as well as the cell cycle machinery (3). Likewise, disturbed
ribosome synthesis impairs cell cycle progression by activat-
ing the p53 pathway (8–10). Studying the coordination of
cell cycle progression and ribosome biogenesis requires pro-
found knowledge of both processes. The conveniences of
yeast genetics, such as the generation of temperature sensitive
mutants have provided deep insides into the complex eukary-
otic ribosome synthesis machinery (15). However, classical
genetic knock-out approaches in mammalian cells are labori-
ous, in particular, if required in a conditional manner for
essential genes, such as many ribosome synthesis factors
like Pes1 presumably might be (19). The siRNA mediated
knock-down technique now provides a rapid and powerful
tool for the analysis of factors involved in mammalian ribo-
some biogenesis. In this study we showed that the combination
of conditional gene expression and siRNA mediated knock-
down techniques enabled the functional analysis of mutant
Pes1 proteins in the absence of a dominant-negative pheno-
type. First, we noticed that exogenous wt Pes1 closely resem-
bled the endogenous expression levels after the prolonged
incubation (7 days) with doxycycline and substituted for
endogenous Pes1 in rRNA processing. Interestingly, exoge-
nous wt Pes1 exceeds the endogenous expression levels,
when cells were harvested one day after the addition of
doxycycline (data not shown). Hence, the Pes1 protein level
apparently is tightly controlled in mammalian cells and excess
amounts of Pes1 might be subject to proteasomal degradation.
Interestingly, polyubiquitination bands were virtually not
detected with the endogenous Pes1 upon treatment with pro-
teasome inhibitors (data not shown), however easily with
the overexpressed exogenous Pes1 when incubated with
doxycycline for one day.
Next, we found that M6, lacking the acidic regions, recon-
stituted for depletion of endogenous Pes1 in rRNA process-
ing. Acidic domains are frequently found in nucleolar
proteins, such as nucleophosmin and nucleostemin, but so
far a common function remains elusive. Deletion of the acidic
domain of nucleostemin did not interfere with its nucleolar
localization (35). In nucleophosmin, the acidic regions were
found to be crucial for its interaction with the tumour sup-
pressor p19ARF (32). Hence, the acidic domain of Pes1
might mediate unknown protein–protein interactions, as its
deletion does not interfere with incorporation into the
PeBoW-complex (21). Interestingly, truncation of the acidic
domain of Pes1 in conjunction with the very C-terminal
region (M5) results in a nucleolar localized dominant-
negative mutant that blocks rRNA processing. However,
removal of the C-terminal region only, is insufficient to elicit
a dominant-negative phenotype (21). Thus, additional
removal of the acidic regions apparently contributes to the
inhibitory effects of M5. Nevertheless, further investigations
are required to explore the role of the acidic domains of Pes1.
We cannot exclude that the acidic regions of Pes1 have any
impact on ribosome maturation and may influence overall
ribosomal stability, but they are not required for the process-
ing of the 32S rRNA precursor into the mature 28S rRNA.
Deletion of the BRCT-domain of Pes1 caused diffuse nucleo-
plasmic localization and failure to sustain rRNA processing
in Pes1 depleted cells. This is remarkable, as the mutant
M10, consisting of the Pes1 N-terminal domain only and
hence lacking the BRCT-domain, localizes properly to the
nucleolus. The Pes1 N-terminal domain (Pfam-domain:
PF06732) exhibits the highest degree of evolutionary conser-
vation and apparently is sufficient to direct itself into the
nucleolus. Thus, the BRCT-domain is required for nucleolar
localization only in the context of the full-length Pes1 pro-
tein. These observations are reminiscent of the ones reported
for the nucleolar GTP-binding protein nucleostemin. Single
residue exchanges within the GTP-binding domain resulted
in diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution. Additional removal of
an extended region, termed internal-domain (I-domain),

restored nucleolar localization and relieved the nucleoplasmic
holdback (35). It will be interesting to explore whether so far
unknown regions within the Pes1 protein cooperate with the
BRCT-domain in the control of the nucleolar localization.
BRCT-domains are frequently found in factors involved in
DNA-damage and repair pathways and are thought to mediate
phosphorylation dependent protein–protein interactions (29).
Occasionally, the BRCT-repeats specifically contact BRCT-
repeats in other proteins, as it has been reported for the inter-
actions of XRCC1 with DNA ligase III (36). Most frequently,
however, BRCT-repeats interact with protein domains of dif-
ferent structure. For example, the tandem BRCT-repeats of
53BP1 contact the DNA-binding domain of p53 (37). Only
a few BRCT-repeat containing proteins were identified in
the nucleolar proteome (http://Lamondlab.com/NOPdb/),
such as XRCC1 and TOPBP1 (topoisomerase II binding
protein 1). XRCC1 functions as scaffold protein in the base
excision response and is therefore directly linked to DNA
repair. To our knowledge, Pes1 is the only rRNA processing
factor harbouring a BRCT-domain. Yeast strains with point
mutations in the BRCT-domain of Nop7p (Yph1p), the
respective homologue of Pes1, exhibited a temperature sensi-
tive growth (20,27). However, subcellular localization of
Nop7p and rRNA processing were not investigated in these
strains. Therefore, we inserted analogous and novel point
mutations in highly conserved residues of the BRCT-domain
of Pes1 and analysed the subcellular localization and func-
tionality in rRNA processing of the respective mutants.
The W397R exchange was performed in analogy to the
W1837R cancer predisposing mutation in BRCA1 (27).
The BRCT-repeat of Pes1 exhibits a higher homology to
the second BRCT-repeat of BRCA1 than to the first repeat.
Based on structural analysis W1837 is located within the
a30 a-helix of the second BRCT-repeat of BRCA1 and desta-
bilizes the BRCT-repeat (29,38,39). ClustalW-alignment
algorithm suggests an identical position for W397 of Pes1
within the a3 a-helix of the BRCT-domain (Supplementary
Figure 5). Thus, the W397R mutation of Pes1 might also
result in specific BRCT folding defects. The I347R substitu-
tion is predicted to be located within the a1 a-helix and might
affect the secondary structure in a similar way. No point
mutation in BRCA1 corresponding to I347R in Pes1 has
been described so far, besides an adjacent M1783T exchange.
Further, a BIC-database (Breast Cancer Information Core
Database) research reveals a F1761S mutation in BRCA1
that correlates with the F327R exchange in Pes1. In conclu-
sion, a comparison of structural elements and missense muta-
tions in BRCA1 with the BRCT-repeat of Pes1 suggests a
crucial role for the residues W397, I347 and F327. No such
correlations were found for the Pes1-R380W mutant.
Disturbing the integrity of the BRCT-domain by deletion
or by point mutations of critical residues resulted in aberrant
diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution of Pes1. Further, the
nucleoplasmic BRCT-mutants (Pes1-M9, -W397R, -I347R
and F327R) exhibited no obvious accumulation in the cyto-
plasm or formation of precipitates that would be suggestive
of general defects in protein folding. Thus, we suppose that
the mutations within the BRCT-repeat do not affect the
overall structural integrity but rather impose specific con-
formational changes of the BRCT-domain or defects in
protein–protein interactions mediated by the BRCT-domain.
Therefore we favour the view of a specific regulatory mecha-
nism that requires an intact BRCT-domain for proper nucleo-
lar localization of Pes1. The nucleoplasmic BRCT-mutants
also failed to interact with the endogenous PeBoW-
components Bop1 and WDR12. Only Pes1wt and Pes1-
R380W were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated. In line with
these observations Pes1-W397R, -I347R and F327R could
not compensate for depletion of endogenous Pes1 in rRNA
processing assays. Bop1 interacts with Pes1 via a region
(200 amino acids) located in the Pes1 N-terminal domain
and thus quite distant from the BRCT-domain (22). Therefore,
disabling the nucleolar localization of Pes1 by deletion or
point mutations within the BRCT-domain precludes its inter-
action with endogenous Bop1 and WDR12, even though the
interaction site with Bop1 is not affected by the mutagenesis.
Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that deletion of the
BRCT-domain of Pes1 (corresponding to our DBRCT-mutant
M9) did not interfere with its capacity to interact with Bop1
in vitro (34). Consistent with previous studies, the N-terminal
domain of Pes1 was essential and sufficient for in vitro
interaction with Bop1 (21,22). Thus it is unlikely, that a
general folding defect of the DBRCT-mutant impairs Bop1
interaction and nucleolar localization in vivo, as demonstrated
in our study. But nucleoplasmic sequestration may not be the
only mechanism that prevents the interaction of the DBRCT-
mutant (M9) or the respective BRCT point mutants with Bop1
under in vivo conditions. Coordinated overexpression of the
Pes1 mutants together with Bop1 failed to recapitulate the
in vitro results, even though we were able to efficiently
produce stable complexes of ectopic wild-type Pes1 and
Bop1. In principal, providing excess amounts of the Pes1
BRCT-mutant and Bop1 should have at least partially circum-
vented the regulatory impact of subcellular compartmen-
talization. It will be interesting to further investigate the role
of the BRCT-domain of Pes1 for PeBoW-complex assembly
and to explore the mechanism that prevents Pes1 BRCT-
mutant interaction with Bop1 in vivo. Nevertheless, failure
to interact with the endogenous PeBoW-complex might
then negatively affect the stability of the BRCT-mutants.
Indeed, the stability of PeBoW-proteins is interdependent,
and knock-down of Bop1 reduces the level and stability of
Pes1 (M. Rohrmoser et al., manuscript submitted). This argues
for a highly controlled assembly of Pes1 with the remaining
PeBoW-members.
