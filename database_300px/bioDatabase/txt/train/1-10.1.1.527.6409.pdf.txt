[1] As part of the Programme Oce´an Multidisciplinaire Me´so Echelle (POMME) in the
North Atlantic, an extensive data set of high-pressure liquid chromatography pigment
concentrations, phytoplankton absorption coefficients, primary production measurements,
and P versus E curves has been acquired. This data set is analyzed with the objective of
testing whether photosynthetic performances of natural phytoplankton communities are
related to taxonomic characteristics. This objective is addressed in two ways. The first
approach concerns the bulk photosynthetic performances of the water column: the water
column photosynthetic cross section, y*, equals 0.088 m2 gChla1, i.e., 25% higher
than the average for the world ocean. Using multiple regression, size-specific values of y*
are subsequently derived: carbon storage by water column is more efficient with
microphytoplankton (y* = 0.135 m2 gChla1) than with nanophytoplankton
(0.089 m2 gChla1) or picophytoplankton (0.064 m2 gChla1). The second (independent)
approach examines the correlations between photophysiological properties and several
abiotic and biotic variables. The correlations are weak, if any, between photophysiological
properties and abiotic factors (temperature, nitrate concentration, and irradiance), while
significant correlations are reported with biotic factors (proportion of the different
phytoplankton groups, average size of the phytoplankton assemblage). Our results suggest
that when large phytoplankton populations predominate at the expense of smaller ones, the
specific absorption coefficient is expectedly lower, while other photophysiological
properties aB, Pmax
B , and Fcmax, are higher. The agreement between both independent
approaches points out that large phytoplankton (essentially diatoms) are potentially more
efficient in carbon storage than any other phytoplankton groups on a chlorophyll a or light
absorption basis.

1. Introduction
[2] Bio-optical models developed for the estimation of
marine primary production P (g C m3 s1), and often used
with remotely sensed ocean color data, are of the general
form
P ¼ 12 PAR Chla½ a*Fc; ð1Þ
with PAR (mole quanta m2 s1) being the photosynthetic
available radiation, [Chla] (mg m3) the chlorophyll a
concentration, a* (m2 mg Chla1), the [Chla]-specific
absorption coefficient, and Fc (mole carbon mole
quanta1) the quantum efficiency for carbon fixation.
The factor 12 allows for the conversion of moles into
grams of carbon. It is generally recognized that the
variance in P is essentially driven by the product PAR
[Chla] [Platt and Sathyendranath, 1988].
[3] The estimation of PAR or [Chla] is not an issue.
These variables can be estimated with reasonable accuracy,
even at the global scale, by measurement or modeling. The

estimation of the second-order source of variance in P, the
product a* Fc, is more challenging. As a first approxima-
tion, statistical relationships that relate a* [Bricaud et al.,
1995] and Fc [Wozniak et al., 1992] to [Chla] can be used.
While such relationships reproduce average trends, they
remain nevertheless limited in accounting for the natural
variability of a* and Fc.
[4] The dependence of phytoplankton bio-optical and
photophysiological properties on abiotic factors, such as
light, temperature and nutrients has been extensively docu-
mented from laboratory experiments [e.g., Sakshaug et al.,
1989; Geider et al., 1996; Stramski et al., 2002] and only
partially in the field [e.g., Cleveland et al., 1989; Babin et
al., 1996; Bouman et al., 2003; Maranon et al., 2003]. The
laboratory studies have served as a basis for the develop-
ment of parameterizations, sometimes empirical, that have
been implemented in primary production models. This is,
for example, the case for temperature [e.g., Morel, 1991] or,
more recently for light and nutrients [Behrenfeld et al.,
2002]. These parameterizations, however, are not fully
satisfactory. They have generally been established on well
controlled (monospecific) cultures by studying the effect of
one forcing variable (the others being kept constant) on the
photophysiological or bio-optical responses. These param-
eterizations can hardly represent natural conditions where
concurrent variations of environmental forcing is the rule.
The physiological responses to these forcing are nonlinear,
involve feedback processes and are thus highly complex.
Therefore the accurate and realistic representation of phys-
iological variability in bio-optical models essentially
remains a nonresolved issue [Behrenfeld et al., 2002;
Sorensen and Siegel, 2001].
[5] At any time and location, the composition of the
phytoplankton community can be considered as the integra-
tor not only of the influence of various abiotic factors but
also of the spatiotemporal occurrence of these forcings
(including, for example, intermittency in light and nutrient
supply which have an impact on the environmental history
of phytoplankton). For example, prochlorophytes predom-
inate in the highly stratified and nutrient depleted environ-
ments of the subtropical gyres [e.g., Partensky et al., 1999]
while diatoms are generally the dominant group in highly
dynamic and nutrient replete upwelling systems.
[6] If the concurrent influence of abiotic factors on
photosynthetic performances are difficult to explicitly
implement in biophysical or physiological models, one
alternative would therefore be to index these performances
on the composition of phytoplankton communities. Some
studies [Claustre et al., 1997; Hashimoto and Shiomoto,
2002] have indeed suggested that the efficiency of a
water column for photosynthetic carbon fixation could
be dependant on the composition of the phytoplankton
assemblage. To date however, no in situ investigation has
clearly attempted to quantitatively infer photo physiological
parameters from the knowledge of phytoplankton commu-
nity composition. It is thus the main purpose of the present
investigation to test whether photophysiological and bio-
optical properties and water column efficiency for carbon
fixation are related to the composition of phytoplankton
communities.
[7] For bio-optical properties, we already have some
indications about the relationship with the composition of
phytoplankton communities. For example, a* can be in-
ferred from the community composition. Numerous studies
have indeed shown that variability of a* is essentially
driven by the so-called package effect which is mainly
affected by the size of the phytoplankton assemblage
[Bricaud et al., 2004]. It is recognized that oceanic areas
with high chlorophyll a concentrations are indeed associated
with large phytoplankton, and vice versa [Chisholm,
1992; Claustre, 1994]. Thus the Bricaud et al. [1995]
parameterization between a* and [Chla] implicitly relies
on a relationship between community composition (or size
distribution of the phytoplankton assemblage) and [Chla].
By contrast, and to our best knowledge, no clear relation-
ships have been established to date between Fc and, more
generally, the parameters of the P versus E curves and
phytoplankton community composition. The parameteriza-
tion of Wozniak et al. [1992] implies that Fc, through its
maximal value Fcmax, is high at elevated [Chla] and low in
oligotrophic regimes. This observation would suggest that
large phytoplankton (e.g., diatoms) have higher Fc than
small phytoplankton (e.g., picoplankton).
[8] The lack of comprehensive in situ investigations in
the past linking taxonomic to photosynthetic performances
essentially resides in the difficulty of acquiring quantitative
and reliable data on phytoplankton community composition,
especially over the whole size range of natural populations
(0.5–200 mm). This would require enumeration of phy-
toplankton populations (cytometry for small groups, mi-
croscopy for larger ones) combined with an estimation of
their size and a use of appropriate conversion factors to
derive biomass. This is a tedious task, highly sensitive to the
choice of conversion factors and, in any case not easy to
implement on a routine basis.
[9] A single high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis provides the concentration of a suite of
pigments ranging from the specific pigments of the tiny
Prochlorococcus to the largest diatoms. Various methods
have subsequently been proposed to quantify the biomass of
the main phytoplankton population [Gieskes et al., 1988;
Bustillos-Guzman et al., 1995; Mackey et al., 1996] or to
derive chlorophyll a associated with specific size ranges
[Claustre, 1994; Vidussi et al., 2001; Bricaud et al., 2004;
J. Uitz et al., From surface chlorophyll a to phytoplankton
community composition in oceanic waters, submitted to
Limnology and Oceanography, 2005, hereinafter referred to
as Uitz et al., submitted manuscript, 2005]. Such pigment-
based methods offer the quantitative basis to evidence a
potential relationship between photophysiological proper-
ties and phytoplankton community composition. This is the
approach we applied in the present study.
[10] We used an extensive database (HPLC pigment data,
P versus E curves, phytoplankton absorption measurements,
in situ primary production measurements) acquired as part
of an intensive investigation undertaken in 2001 in the
northeast Atlantic in the frame of the Programme Oce´an
Multidisciplinaire Me´so Echelle (POMME) [Me´mery et al.,
2005]. The sampling was performed during three main
periods encompassing the range of seasonal hydrodynami-
cal and biogeochemical conditions prevailing in this area:
(1) winter mixing with biological production limited by
light, while the system is nutrient replete; (2) onset of
stratification and beginning of the spring bloom; (3) sum-

mer stratification and associated oligotrophy. As a result of
the spatial and temporal diversity of conditions covered by
the present study, it was expected that the analysis of the
data set would allow to draw more general inferences, more
specifically the following: (1) what are the advantages of
taxonomic-based parameterizations of bio-optical models
when compared to ‘‘classical’’ models with parameteriza-
tions relying on the dependence of photophysiology on
abiotic factors? (2) Is it possible to embed a taxonomic-
dependant parameterization in bio-optical models?
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Investigation Zone and Sampling Strategy
[11] The investigated area, a rectangle of 500 km longi-
tude by 750 km latitude is centered at 41.5N, 19W
between the Iberian Peninsula and the Azores Archipelago.
It encompasses the so-called discontinuity zone, which
corresponds to a transition zone between two main areas;
the northern part is characterized by a deep late winter
mixed layer (up to 500 m), while shallow (100–150 m)
winter mixed layers are observed in the southern part
[Paillet and Arhan, 1996]. At the basin scale, these hydro-
logical differences have marked implications on the timing
as well as on the intensity of the spring bloom [Siegel et al.,
2002]. In addition, this part of the northeast Atlantic is
subjected to a significant mesoscale activity (current mean-
dering, presence of eddies), which is expected to impact
both the magnitude and the quality (taxonomic composi-
tion) of primary production.
[12] Within the POMME domain, and with the objective
of covering the three main hydrological and biogeochem-
ical conditions, the sampling strategy was based on three
55 day cruises during 2001. Each cruise was subdivided
into two legs. The first legs were devoted to a quasi-
synoptical survey of the area. They consisted in a network
of 80 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) rosette sta-
tions (spaced by 30 nautical miles) for the measurement of
core hydrological and biogeochemical properties. The sec-
ond legs were focused on process studies at four stations.
These stations were chosen, on the basis of the LEG 1
synoptical survey associated with quasi real-time data
assimilation and modeling, to resolve the range of variabil-
ity in mesoscale structures (fronts, meanders, gyres) typical
of this area. These stations were intensively sampled for
biogeochemical stocks and rate measurements over 2 day
periods each.
2.2. Light and Hydrological Measurements
[13] For POMME 1 (3 February – 19 March) and
POMME 2 (24 March–3 May) onboard the R/V L’Atalante,
meteorological data were acquired using an instrumented
mast equipped with an Eppley pyranometer to measure total
sun radiation [Caniaux et al., 2005], from which Photo-
synthically Available Radiation was derived. For POMME3
(26 August–8 October) onboard the R/V Thalassa, total sun
radiation derived from METEOSAT data was obtained
from the Spatial Meteorological Center (Lannion, France).
Fluxes were hourly resolved with a spatial resolution of
0.04 degrees of longitude/latitude [Caniaux et al., 2005]. In
addition, PAR at the sea surface under clear sky was derived
as by Morel [1991].
[14] The depth of the mixed layer, Zm (m), was esti-
mated from excess density profiles derived from CTD
casts. It corresponds to the depth where the density is
higher than the surface one by more than 0.02 kg m3.
The depth of the euphotic layer, Ze (m), defined as the
depth where irradiance is reduced to 1% of its surface
value, was estimated according to Morel and Berthon
[1989] using the [Chla] vertical profiles. The statistical
relationships presented by Morel and Berthon [1989] and
linking Ze to the integrated content in Chlorophyll a,
hChlai, were updated using the parameterization proposed
by Morel and Maritorena [2001]. The ratio of the geo-
metrical depth, Z, to Ze (Z/Ze, dimensionless) is also used
as an optical depth.
2.3. Absorption and Pigment Measurements and
Data Reduction
[15] For the measurements of pigment concentrations and
particulate absorption coefficients, 2.8 L of seawater were
filtered onto 25 mm Whatman GF/F glass-fiber filters. The
optical density of the filter was subsequently monitored
over the 370–750 nm spectral range using a LICOR
spectroradiometer (LI-1800) equipped with an integrating
sphere. The spectral absorption coefficient of phytoplank-
ton, af(l) (m
1) was derived as described by Claustre et al.
[2000].
[16] Immediately after the optical density measurement,
the filters were stored in liquid nitrogen until laboratory
analysis of pigments. Samples were extracted in 3 mL
HPLC-grade methanol and injected into a reversed phase
C8 Hypersil MOS column (dimensions of 3 
 100 mm,
3 mm pore size) and analyzed with an Agilent Technologies
1100 series HPLC system coupled to a Thermoquest
AS3000 autosampler. The HPLC procedure derived from
the protocol of Vidussi et al. [1996] is detailed by Claustre
et al. [2004]. Precision of the method averaged 5% and the
detection limit for chlorophyll a and a carotenoid, fucoxan-
thin, was 0.001 mg m3.
[17] Several methods have been proposed to retrieve
quantitative information on size structure of the communi-
ties using HPLC pigment concentrations. Claustre [1994]
proposed a criterion that represents the proportion of
microphytoplankton (20–200 mm) within a phytoplankton
community. This approach was thereafter extended by
Vidussi et al. [2001] to derive the [Chla] associated with
three main phytoplankton size classes (pico- (<2 mm),
nano- (20–200 mm) and microphytoplankton). This study
assumed that the taxonomic pigment/Chla ratio was iden-
tical for all phytoplankton populations, an assumption that
was not strictly realistic [Vidussi et al., 2001]. Vidussi et
al.’s [2001] approach was recently revisited and improved
on the basis of the analysis of a large pigment database by
Uitz et al. (submitted manuscript, 2005). The variability in
the taxonomic pigment/Chla ratio according to the various
populations is now taken into account and thus the biomass
proportion of the three main phytoplankton size classes
more accurately determined. The equation allowing the
retrieval of these size fractions have recently been pub-
lished by Bricaud et al. [2004]. Additionally Bricaud et al.
[2004] derived a phytoplankton size index, SI (mm), by
giving a central size value to each class (1 mm, 5 mm and
50 mm for pico-, nano-, and microphytoplankton, respec-

tively) and weighting by the biomass proportion of each
class.
2.4. Photosynthesis-Irradiance Curves (P Versus E)
[18] The parameters of the relationship between carbon
fixation by phytoplankton and irradiance (so-called P versus
E curve) were determined as described by Babin et al.
[1996]. Briefly, after inoculation with inorganic 14C
(NaH14CO3, 0.4 mCi/mL, Amersham1), each sample
was subdivided into 12 50 mL subsamples and incubated
for 2 hours at different light levels in a radial photo-
synthetron described by Babin [1994]. To determine the
initial activity, three aliquots of 25 mL were taken immedi-
ately after inoculation and added to 50 mL of an organic
base (ethanolamin), 1 mL of distilled water and 10 mL
of the scintillation cocktail (Packard
1
, Aquasol-2). The
photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) at each posi-
tion in the incubation chambers was measured using a
quantum scalar irradiance meter (Biospherical
1
Instruments,
QSL100). Temperature in the incubation chambers was
maintained at in situ temperature (±1C) using thermo-
regulated water circulating baths. After incubation, subsam-
ples were filtered under low vacuum onto glass fiber filters
(Whatman
1
, GF/F, 25 mm), wetted with 1 mL of HCl 1N,
kept under a fuming hood for 1 hour, and placed into 10 mL
of scintillation cocktail. Activity was measured in the
laboratory using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard
1
,
Minaxi Tricarb Serie 4000), and the carbon fixation rate was
calculated as by Parsons et al. [1984] and normalized to
[Chla] to obtain PB [mg C (mg Chla)1 h1].

2.5. Primary Production Measurements
[20] In situ primary production measurements were per-
formed exclusively during the Leg 2 of the 3 cruises (four
vertical profiles per cruise). The rate of carbon fixation was
quantified using the 14C method according to the experi-
mental protocol detailed by Moutin and Raimbault [2002].
Samples (320 mL polycarbonate bottles, three light and one
dark sample per depth, seven to eight depths) were collected
before sunrise using 12 L Niskin bottles, inoculated with
20 mCi of NaH14CO3 (Amersham CFA3) just before sunrise,
and then incubated in situ. After 24 hours, the samples were
filtered onto 25 mm GF/F filters to measure net fixation (AN,
mgC m3). Filters were then covered with 500 ml of 0.5 M
HCl and stored for counting at the laboratory. Each day,
three samples were filtered immediately after inoculation for
to determination, and 250 mL of sample was taken at random
from three bottles and stored with 250 mL of ethanolamine
to determine the quantity of added tracer (Qi). In the
laboratory, samples were dried during 12 hours at 60C,
10 mL of ULTIMAGOLD-MV (Packard) were added to the
filters and the activity was determined after 24 hours using a
Packard Tri carb 2100 TR liquid scintillation counter.
[21] Daily (24 hours, dawn to dawn) primary production
(P, mg C m3 s1) was obtained from the difference
between light and dark bottle measurements. Areal primary
production (hPi, g C m2 d1) was calculated assuming that
(1) subsurface (about 5 m) rates are identical to surface rates
(not measured) and (2) P is null at 20 m below the deepest
sampled depth (below the euphotic layer).
3. Results
3.1. Light and Hydrological Context at the
Seasonal Scale
[22] The daily and seasonal variability in irradiance at the
sea surface (Figure 1a), and in the thicknesses of mixed and
euphotic layers (Figure 1b) indicate that the phytoplankton
communities experienced a wide range of light forcing
conditions. During summer (POMME 3), the euphotic layer
(62–137 m) generally extended deeper than the mixed layer
(<50 m). During POMME 1 and POMME 2, Ze and Zm
were covarying (r = 0.64; n = 186; p < 0.001): the deeper
the mixed layer (beginning of winter investigations), the
clearer the waters (the lower the phytoplankton biomass)
and reciprocally. This trend likely reflects the transition
between limiting and nonlimiting light conditions in the
control of phytoplankton growth and biomass accumulation
(nutrients were never depleted at these periods [Ferna´ndez
et al., 2005]). Over the winter–spring period, the mixed
layer indeed gradually decreased by a factor of 5 while
surface irradiance was increasing by a factor 2 (and day
length by 4 hours). Thus the average light received by
phytoplankton cells was overall increasing, allowing the
progressive biomass accumulation, hence implying a de-
crease in Ze.
3.2. Phytoplankton Responses at the Seasonal Scale
3.2.1. Biomass and Phytoplankton Community
Composition
3.2.1.1. General Seasonal Evolution
[23] The end of summer (POMME 3) was clearly the
period of low phytoplankton biomass while spring
(POMME 2) corresponded to the period of highest bio-
mass (Table 1, Figure 2a). Biomass levels in the winter
time were intermediary. In winter, pico- and nanophyto-
plankton mostly equally contributed to chlorophyll a
biomass (45% of the biomass each). During the second
leg of POMME 1, there was a clear and regular increase
in biomass which likely corresponds to the bloom initia-
tion. This transition was clearly marked by an evolution in
the phytoplankton community composition (Figure 2b)
with microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton biomass
increasing at the expense of picophytoplankton. Later on
during spring, nanophytoplankton were, on average, dom-
inant while micro- and picophytoplankton represented the
same proportion of the biomass (20%). At the end of the
summer period, picophytoplankton was the dominant phy-
toplankton (55%) and microphytoplankton the lowest
(7%).
3.2.1.2. Vertical Pattern
[24] Clear seasonal differences were observed in the ver-
tical distribution of the phytoplankton biomass (Figure 3).
Average winter profiles display a 30–40 m homogenous
biomass layer (0.35–0.40 mg Chla m3) and a regular

decrease down to 200 m, with the community composition
remaining remarkably constant within the upper 100 m
layer (Figure 3d). During spring (POMME 2), the biomass
increased toward the surface (up to 0.7 mg Chla m3,
maximum recorded: 1.8 mg Chla m3); this increase was
essentially associated (on average) with nanophytoplankton
which represented 60–65% of the biomass in this layer. At
the end of summer, surface [Chla] was low (0.08 mg Chla
m3) and was mostly due to the presence of picophyto-
plankton (zeaxanthin containing cyanobacteria, i.e.,
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus), which represented
up to 70% of the biomass in this layer (Figure 3f). At 50–
60 m, a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) (0.27 mg
m3) developed with similar contributions of pico- and
nanophytoplanktonic populations. Below the DCM, the
increase in picophytoplankton was essentially due to the
presence of DV-Chlb containing Prochlorococcus.
3.2.2. Primary Production
[25] Average primary production profiles (four casts per-
formed during each LEG 2) clearly revealed (Figure 4) that
the winter time is a period of significant production,
surprisingly not so different from the spring one, where
the bloom is expected. Actually, areal primary production
in spring (825 ± 270 mg C m2 d1), was only 37% higher
than for winter conditions (602 ± 193 mg C m2 d1).
Summer surface primary production was extremely low
(<5 mg C m3 d1), as a consequence of low biomass
(Figure 3); similarly areal primary production was low with
a value of 205 ± 30 mg C m2 d1, typical of highly
oligotrophic conditions.
3.2.3. Variations of the Photophysiological Properties
[26] The spectrally averaged [Chla]-specific absorption
coefficient, a*F, displayed a rather homogeneous vertical
distribution in winter and spring (Figure 5, Table 2). The
Figure 2. Temporal evolution of the phytoplankton biomass within the euphotic layer during the three

lowest values were recorded in spring, when the phyto-
plankton assemblage was more dominated by large phyto-
plankton (diatoms and flagellates) than in winter. In
summer, when zeaxanthin containing picophytoplankton
dominated, especially in surface layers, the highest values
of a*F were recorded.
[27] The [Chla] normalized maximum photosynthetic
rates, Pmax
B , were the highest during the spring time with
maximal surface values of 3.6 mg C mg Chla1 h1
(Figure 5b). While the winter profile of Pmax
B , like the winter
profile of biomass and of other photophysiological param-
eters, displayed a homogenous distribution with depth
(between 1.5 and 2.0 mg C mg Chla1 h1), the
summer one presented some stratification with the highest
value at the surface (2.7 mg C mg Chla1 h1) and the
lowest one at depth.
[28] The normalized, light-limited photosynthetic effi-
ciency, aB, shows its highest values during spring and its
lowest during summer especially in the top 20 m. This
seasonal and vertical pattern was similar for the maximum
quantum yield of carbon fixation, FCmax. FCmax covered a
wide range of variations in surface layers with the lowest
values in summer (0.008 ± 0.003 mole C mole quanta1)

(decrease) of FCmax with depth in summer (spring), while
the winter profiles presented a homogenous vertical
distribution around a central value of 0.03 mole C

which photosynthesis saturates, showed no significant
variations with depth in winter (around a central value of
50 mm quanta m2 s1), was slightly higher at surface in

4. Discussion
4.1. Water Column Photosynthetic Cross Section and
Community Composition
[29] When applied to the entire productive column (i.e.,
from surface to 1.5 Ze), equation (1) can be rewritten as
Ph i ¼ 1=39 PAR 0þð Þy* Chlah i; ð5Þ
where hPi is the areal primary production expressed in g C
m2 d1 PAR(0+), the daily-integrated photosynthetic
available radiation at the surface is now expressed in
energy units (KJ m2 d1, through a conversion of
2.5 1018 quanta J1 [Morel and Smith, 1974], the factor 39
corresponds to the energetic equivalent of 1 g of C (39 KJ
g C1), hChlai is the photic layer integrated chlorophyll a
content (g Chla m2), and Y* (m2 g Chla1) corresponds
to the water column cross section for carbon fixation.
From the examination of equations (1) and (5), it is
obvious that Y* can be considered as a proxy of the water
column averaged product a* Fc. Interestingly, while a*
and Fc might present large variations [Bricaud et al.,
1995; Wozniak et al., 1992], it has been reported that, for
the global ocean, Y* varies within a relatively narrow
range around a central value of 0.070 ± 0.035 m2 g
Chla1 [Morel, 1991]. This relative invariance reveals that
the product a* Fc remains confined within a relatively
narrow interval, a feature already reported by Morel et al.
[1996].

[30] In the present study,Y* averaged 0.088 ± 0.017 m2 g
Chla1 for the 12 primary production profiles determined
during the three POMME cruises. Some seasonal differ-
ences in Y* were observed, especially when comparing the
spring period, when Y* has the highest value, with summer
period. These two periods represent the extremes in terms of
phytoplankton biomass as well as community composition.
The period when large phytoplankton dominates (spring)
presents larger water column efficiency for carbon fixation
than the oligotrophic period essentially dominated by
picophytoplankton.
[31] In order to test the hypothesis of a possible size-
specific dependency in y*, equation (5) is rewritten as
P ¼ 1=39 PAR 0þð Þ picoChla
 
Ypico*
 þ nanoChlah iYnano*
þ microChlah iYmicro*

; ð6Þ
where Y*pico, Y*nano, and Y*micro represent the partial water
column photosynthetic cross sections of pico-, nano-,
and microphytoplankton, respectively, and hpicoChlai,
hnanoChlai and hmicroChlai correspond to size-specific
[Chla] integrated over the euphotic layer. Y*pico, Y*nano,
and Y*micro were estimated through multiple regression
between the dimensionless term 39 P/PAR(0+) (dependant
variable) and the three size-specific hChlai (independent
variables).
[32] Results from this regression reveal clear and sig-
nificant trends (r = 0.92, n = 12, p < 0.001): Y*micro
(0.127 ± 0.023 m2 gChla1) is twice higher than Y*pico
(0.065 ± 0.032 m2 gChla1), while Y*nano presents an
intermediate value (0.086 ± 0.016 m2 gChla1). In other
words, for the same amount of chlorophyll a biomass
within the euphotic layer, and for the same surface
irradiance, carbon fixation is twice higher when diatoms
dominate the community as compared to picoplankton
dominated communities. This result confirms the previous
study of Claustre et al. [1997] where, in a completely
different environment (the Southern Ocean), it was shown
that diatoms, with an average Y* of 0.11 m2 g Chla1,
were the most efficient primary producers compared to
any other phytoplankton groups. Similar conclusions were
also obtained in the subarctic Pacific by Hashimoto and
Shiomoto [2002], who showed that light utilization effi-
ciency, as expressed by an analog of Y* (Y, the water
column light utilization index [Falkowski, 1981]), is
higher for large phytoplankton, possibly diatoms, than
for smaller phytoplankton. Typically, diatoms, and to a
lesser extent nanophytoplankton, are the opportunistic
species of favorable environmental (light and nutrient)
conditions which prevail during spring time. In this study,
picoplankton cope with low light in winter (deep mixing)
and low nutrients in summer. The micro-size fraction, and
to a lesser extent the nano-size fraction are the groups of
the more favorable environment.
[33] This possible dependence of the water column cross
section for carbon fixation on the composition of the
phytoplankton community can be confirmed by a similar
dependence of the photophysiological properties. This is the
main purpose of the following section.

(Figure 5). Trying to relate these variations to changes either
in phytoplankton community composition or in abiotic
factors (temperature, light, nutrients) essentially reveals that
the correlations are primarily dependent on the scale of
observation (the season or the year) (Tables 3 and 4,
Figures 6 and 7).
[35] The positive correlation between Pmax
B , temperature
and light during summer is the result of adaptation of the
phytoplankton maximal potential for photosynthesis to
stable light and temperature conditions (stratified condi-
tions) (see the regular decrease of Pmax
B over 0–75 m
(Figure 5)). At the yearly scale however, Pmax
B is clearly
not controlled by temperature (Table 4). This important
result contradicts, at least partly, previous studies that
use relationships linking Pmax
B to temperature when
estimating primary production from satellite chlorophyll
maps [Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997; Antoine and Morel,
1996]. The rationale for using such a relationship is the
known temperature dependency of enzymatically driven
dark reactions of photosynthesis. Some of these relation-
ships have been derived from laboratory-controlled mono-
specific cultures. For natural conditions however, even if
these physiological mechanisms still hold at the species
level, they can be hidden by concurrent responses to other
abiotic factors (light and nutrient) and by changes in species
composition. At the yearly scale indeed it becomes difficult
to highlight a clear response of Pmax
B to a given abiotic
factor. However some trends do emerge between Pmax
B and
biotic factors (Figure 7). Notably, Pmax
B (as well as aB) is
positively related with the proportion of microphyto-
plankton (roughly the proportion of diatoms). At this stage,
however, it is not possible to determine whether diatoms
have an intrinsic Pmax
B (or aB) higher than other phyto-
plankton. This result solely reflects the observation that
Pmax
B was the highest during spring time when the propor-
tion of diatoms was the highest (Table 1, Figures 3 and 4).
This property is promising in view of using community
composition as an empirical predictor of Pmax
B .

5 year observation time series in the Sargasso Sea, clearly

shows that only few environmental parameters correlate
with Fcmax, which makes this important variable difficult to
predict. Other studies pointed out the difficulty to relate
Fcmax variability to environmental forcing variables and
consequently emphasized that quantum yield-based primary
production models behave as poor predictors of primary
production [Siegel et al., 2001; Sorensen and Siegel, 2001].
In the present study, Fcmax, which does not show any
relationship with biotic and abiotic factors at any season
(Table 3), is positively related to size (and to %micro) at the
yearly scale (Figure 7, Table 4). The greater the size of the
phytoplankton assemblage, the higher the value of Fcmax.
This result is not in agreement with observations, mostly
conducted on laboratory controlled cultures of single spe-
cies, where energetic efficiencies are considered to be
independent of size [e.g., Finkel, 2001, and reference
therein]. However, the present results demonstrate that,
when large phytoplankton (diatoms) are present, Fcmax
(and also Pmax
B and aB) is higher than for other phytoplank-
ton communities. These results also suggest that size might
be a good proxy for inferring changes in essential photo-
physiological properties like Fcmax, Pmax
B and aB.
[37] In contrast to our observations made on Fcmax
and Pmax
B , the (negative) correlation between a*F and size
is an expected result (Table 4). The greater the size, the
larger is the so-called packaging effect and the lower is the
specific absorption coefficient [Morel and Bricaud, 1981].
The data presented here represent a subset of a larger data
set which fully confirms, on natural samples and using the
same pigment–size derived index, that a* is strongly
dependent on cell size [Bricaud et al., 2004].
4.3. Toward an Embedded Taxonomic-Dependent
Parameterization of Bio-optical Models
[38] Several investigations have pointed out the possible
role of changes in community composition as a possible
driver of variations in photophysiological properties
[Cullen, 1990; Johnson and Howd, 2000; Sorensen and
Siegel, 2001]. Our observations show that community
composition is also a good index of photophysiological
properties. In fact, it integrates the combined effects of
several abiotic factors, as well as possible species-specific
properties.
[39] Therefore as an alternative to previous attempts to
relate photophysiological properties of phytoplankton to
abiotic factors, we proposed to develop a taxonomic-
dependant parameterization of photosynthesis in bio-optical
primary production models.
[40] In the same way as hPi was decomposed into partial
production associated with each main phytoplankton size

group (equation (6)), the main photophysiological or bio-

where X corresponds to a non-normalized quantity (a, a or
Pmax) and X* represents the [Chla]-normalized quantity
associated with either pico-, nano-, or microphytoplankton.
From equation (6), the estimation of Y*pico, Y*nano Y*micro
was possible through multiple regression because the inte-
grated quantities hpicoChlai, hnanoChlai, and hmicroChlai
were independent (LEG2). Here the volumetric concentra-
tion [picoChla], [nanoChla], and [microChla] acquired during
LEG1 are not strictly independent as [nanoChla], and

[microChla] showed some degree of correlation. Thus the
partial coefficients derived by multiple regression are only
indicative (Table 5). The trends reported in section IV.2
are nevertheless confirmed. As expected, the specific
absorption coefficient of picophytoplankton appears to
be the highest. Similarly and as expected from Figure 7
(Pmax
B versus size), Pmax
B would be higher for microphyto-
plankton than for picophytoplankton. The same observation
is made for aB and for the derived quantity FCmax (ratio of
specific aB by specific a*F). Using the estimation of the size
group–specific a*F, Pmax
B and aB coefficients, the prediction
of a*F, Pmax and a on the basis from the volumetric
concentration [picoChla], [nanoChla], and [microChla] is
highly satisfactory (Figure 8).
[41] The present observations are in close agreement with
the Y* based approach: the larger the phytoplankton, the
lower its efficiency in light capture (result already known)
and the higher its efficiency for carbon fixation (at both low
and high irradiances). It should be noted that, when envi-
ronmental conditions appear most favorable, likely in
spring, diatoms (and also nanoplankton) are at maximum
of their abundance and more generally, the size of the
phytoplankton assemblage is at its highest.
4.4. Seasonal Biomass and Production Budget of the
POMME Area
[42] The large pigment data set acquired during the first
LEGs of the three cruises (80 HPLC stations each time)
allows a description of phytoplankton pigment distribution
with an unprecedented spatial resolution for such a large
area. When size class–specific [Chla] derived from this data
set are combined to measured surface irradiance, primary
production rates (total and specific) can be estimated through
the use of equation (6) for all stations of the sampling grid
(Figure 9) and seasonal trends can be inferred (Table 6).
[43] Overall, irradiance has a highly significant impact on
primary production estimates that do not necessarily
mirror the biomass fields (Figure 9). For example, as a
consequence of extremely low surface irradiance (1 MJ
m2 d1) in winter in the western part of the area, low
primary production rates were estimated (<100 mg C
m2 d1) despite high phytoplankton biomass (>40 mg
Chla m3) (Figure 9). In general, the range of variation in
daily irradiance (factor of 6.3, 2.8, 2.3 between extreme
values in winter, spring and summer, respectively, see also
Figure 1) is higher or comparable to that of hChlai (3.2, 2.4,
2.9) which makes primary production rates equally depen-
dant on both variables. On average, the reduction of primary
production due to cloudiness as compared to maximal
(potential) production by clear sky is 40% in winter, 30%
in spring and 25% in summer (Table 6). However, local
depression of primary production rates of up to 84% can be
recorded for extremely cloudy winter days.
[44] During summer, the highest primary production rates
are recorded in the north eastern part of the POMME area;
actually these high rates are not associated to high biomass.
If size class–specific rates of primary production are
analyzed (Figure 10), the southern part of this high primary
production zone is clearly associated with a tongue of
enhanced microphytoplankton production, which has a
higher Y* than other groups (Table 2). Close examination
of the pigment data show that, for this particular zone,
dinoflagellates (peridinin) and not diatoms (fucoxanthin)
dominate this microphytoplankton assemblage. This micro-
phytoplankton ‘‘spot’’ is located in a cyclonic structure, C31,
highlighted from numerical simulation coupled to assimila-
tion of altimetry and CTD data [Me´mery et al., 2005,
Figure 2]. Such cyclonic structures are expected to support
nutrient fueling into the euphotic layer in such stratified
systems [McGillicuddy et al., 1999].
[45] In winter and as a consequence of a rather constant
composition of the phytoplankton community over the
whole POMME area, group-specific rates of primary pro-
duction mirror the total rates. The highest values are
recorded in close association with the anticyclonic structure
A2 [Me´mery et al., 2005, Figure 2]. At the time of the
spring bloom, this structure has drifted to the South
Western part of the POMME area. It is now clearly
associated with a dominance of diatoms which drive up
to 65% of the carbon fixation. East of this anticyclonic
structure and associated with the jet/front system surround-
ing it, primary production rates are mainly due to nano-
phytoplankton (62%). These observations demonstrate that
during the initiation and the development of the spring
bloom, the qualitative nature of the phytoplankton assem-
blage and of resulting carbon fixation appear spatially
variable. Whether this apparent variability results from
mesoscale dynamics or from a temporal evolution remains
nevertheless to be documented.
5. Conclusion and Perspectives
[46] An essential outcome of the present study is that a
potential alternative does exist for bio-optical models which
try to mechanistically relate photophysiological parameters
to environmental forcing variables [Behrenfeld et al., 2002].
We suggest that these parameters can also be indexed on the
composition of the phytoplankton community. This compo-
sition can indeed be considered as the ultimate integrator of
the environmental forcing variables (and of their complex
interactions) occurring over a variety of spatial and temporal
scales.
[47] To our best knowledge, the present study is one of the
few that addresses bio-optical model parameterization using
such an approach. To be further evaluated, it definitely
requires that in situ studies be designed to establish local,
regional and global databases of simultaneously determined
taxonomic composition (e.g., HPLC), photophysiological
parameters (P versus E curves) and phytoplankton absorp-
tion. To date, such databases are too scarce. This data paucity
is the one important reason why the photophysiological
status of phytoplankton communities has essentially been

analyzed with respect to standard core environmental
variables (light, nutrients, temperature).
[48] Evidence is arising that the size structure or compo-
sition of phytoplankton communities is amenable to a
certain degree of estimation at the global scale, from
remotely sensed [Chla] (Uitz et al., submitted manuscript,
2005). If the trends highlighted in the present study become
confirmed with the availability of more data, the use of bio-
optical models with embedded taxonomic composition
parameterization may thus be generalized at the global
scale. Such models would present a significant improve-
ment over more traditional bio-optical models. Not only
would primary production rates be more accurately deter-
mined, but specific rates of primary production for phyto-
plankton classes or functional groups could be ultimately
derived. Such quantities are essential to feed a new class of
