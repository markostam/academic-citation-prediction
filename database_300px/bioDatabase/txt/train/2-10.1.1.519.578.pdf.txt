ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM OF A CLASS OF
RANDOM NON-ERGODIC SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATORS
R. L. FRANK AND O. SAFRONOV
ABSTRACT. We consider a class of random Schro¨dinger operators with
non-decaying potentials and prove that their absolutely continuous spec-
trum almost surely fills the positive half-line. We establish the existence
of the wave operators using the trace class scattering theory.
1. INTRODUCTION
We consider a class of random Schro¨dinger operators
(1.1) −∆ + Vω, Vω(x) =
∑
j∈J
ωjfj(x)
in L2(Rd), d ≥ 2. Here the ωj are bounded, independent and identically
distributed random variables, the fj are functions with disjoint supports and
J is an index set. In the usual, ergodic case the fj are translates along the
lattice J = Zd, say, of a fixed bump function. Note that in this case the
number of bumps inside the spherical layer {x ∈ Rd : n − 1 ≤ |x| < n}
increases like nd−1 as n → ∞. In the present paper we consider models
where this number grows like ns(d−1) for some parameter s > 1. Hence our
potentials are non-ergodic and the parameter s shows how close they are to
ergodic ones. Note that we do not assume our potentials to decay.
Strong efforts have been devoted to the study of the point spectrum of the
operator (1.1) in the ergodic case. It has been shown in [14], [21] that one-
dimensional ergodic operators have purely point spectra (see also [20], [27],
[9] and, for the case of a discrete distribution of random variables, [8], [25]).
In higher dimensions ergodic Schro¨dinger operators have regions covered
by purely point spectrum. The papers [12], [3] represent two different ap-
proaches to localization (see also [11], [2], [4]). We do not try to list all
the important contributions but refer to the surveys [28], [26], [18] and the
monograph [29]. Moreover, we would like to mention the recent develop-
ments [13], [1], [7]. On the other hand, it is expected that in the ergodic,

multi-dimensional case the operator (1.1) has absolutely continuous spec-
trum for low disorder and away from the edge of the spectrum. Note that
for dimension d = 2 the claims change from time to time. This conjecture
is not proven.
However, there are other, non-ergodic models for which the existence of
absolutely continuous spectrum has been established. First of all we would
like to mention the papers by Bourgain [5] (see also [6]) and Denisov [10].
In their (discrete and continuous, respectively) models the supports of the
functions fj in (1.1) are constant as in the ergodic case, but the height of
the bumps is assumed to decay so that |Vω(x)| ≤ C(1 + |x|)−1/2−². In
[5] the almost sure existence and completeness of local wave operators is
proven, whereas the approach of [10] is in the spirit of trace formulae. In
the paper by Rodnianski, Schlag [24] operators of the form (1.1) are con-
sidered where the size of the bumps increases and the heights of the bumps
decreases so that |Vω(x)| ≤ C(1+ |x|)−3/4. The existence of modified wave
operators is proven there. We would also like to mention the works by Kr-
ishna [19], Kirsch, Krishna, Obermeit [17] and Hundertmark, Kirsch [15]
who essentially assume that (E[Vω(x)2])1/2 ≤ C(1 + |x|)−1−².
In contrast to the preceeding results the absolute value of Vω in our model
can be constant for all x and for all values of the random parameter ω. We
assume that E[ωj] = 0 in our model, which for certain choices of func-
tions fj is only a normalization. Then Vω changes its sign almost surely,
and we will prove that this implies that the interval [0,∞) is covered by
absolutely continuous spectrum. The arguments in our proof depend on the
dimension. In particular, they break down in dimension d = 1, when the
potential becomes the same as in the continuous Anderson model for which
the spectrum is known to be purely point.
We will not describe the details of our model in this introduction but give
an intuitive picture of what is happening. Divide the plane into spherical
layers {x ∈ R2 : n − 1 ≤ |x| < n}, n ∈ N, and divide each layer in
(approximately) ns pieces with some fixed s > 1. Now paint these pieces
randomly in yellow and blue colors. With the growth of n the pieces become
finer and finer and, outside of a large sphere, the plane will look green!
In one of our models (see Section 2) something similar happens to an
electron: Yellow and blue colors correspond to positive and negative bumps
of the potential. At infinity they average to zero and allow the electron to
propagate.
Let us note, however, that this picture is rather naive and is not in relation
with the difficulty of the problem. For example in the ergodic case s = 1 the
average of the potential over the sphere {|x| = r} decreases as a negative
power (presumably as r−(d−1)/2), which means that an observer running
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM 3
around such a sphere will see the green colour, but to prove existence of the
absolutely continuous spectrum for ergodic potentials seems to be a very
hard problem.
We show also that the higher order operator
(−∆)l + Vω, l > d/4,
has absolutely continuous spectrum all over the positive real line under the
condition that
s > 1 + 2/(d− 1).
Thus in this model s → 1 as d → ∞, which gives the proper (ergodic)
limit.
In Section 3 we prove an abstract result which is also applicable to op-
erators having essential spectrum below zero. Our approach is based on a
thorough use of the trace class scattering theory. In this paper we employ it
in a way which is adjusted to cancelations due to the random nature of the
potential.
The authors acknowledge the stimulating role of the paper [10] by
S. Denisov who first applied trace formulae in the study of random oper-
ators.
2. A MODEL WITHOUT DECAY
For each n ∈ N = {1, 2, . . . } we introduce the characteristic function
χn of the interval [n − 1, n) ⊂ R and for each j ∈ Zd we introduce the
characteristic function ξj of the cube j + [0, 1)d ⊂ Rd. We put
fn,j(x) := χn(|x|)ξj(nsx/|x|), n ∈ N, j ∈ Zd,
with a parameter s > 1 to be specified later. Note that
∑
n,j fn,j ≡ 1.
Suppose that ωn,j , n ∈ N, j ∈ Zd, are bounded, independent and identically
distributed random variables with zero expectations,
E[ωn,j] = 0,
and consider the (bounded) random potential
Vω(x) =
∑
n,j
ωn,jfn,j(x), x ∈ Rd.
A typical result of our method is
Theorem 2.1. Let d = 2, 3 and let s > 1 + 2/(d− 1). Then the absolutely
continuous spectrum of the operator−∆+Vω contains [0,∞) almost surely.
Actually, we will prove that the wave operators
W±(−∆ + Vω,−∆) = s− lim
t→±∞
exp(it(−∆ + Vω)) exp(−it(−∆))
4 R. L. FRANK AND O. SAFRONOV
exist almost surely. This implies also that the absolutely continuous spec-
trum of −∆ + Vω is almost surely of infinite multiplicity on [0,∞).
Note that this is indeed a non-deterministic result: If ωn,j = c for all but
finitely many n, j, and some constant c > 0 then the essential spectrum of
−∆ + Vω coincides with [c,∞).
The proof of Theorem 2.1 as well as an extension to higher dimensions will
be given in Section 4.
3. A MORE GENERAL MODEL
3.1. The abstract result. Let V0 ∈ L∞(R+) and introduce the self-adjoint
operators
H0 := H00 + V0(|x|), H00 := −∆
in L2(Rd) with domains
(3.1) D(H0) = D(H00) = H2(Rd).
We denote by P (ac)0 the projection onto the absolutely continuous subspace
of H0. We will consider Schro¨dinger operators
Hω := H0 + Vω
with random electric potential Vω of the form
(3.2) Vω(x) =
∑
j∈J
ωjfj(x), x ∈ Rd.
Assumption 3.1. ω = (ωj)j∈J is a countable family of independent, uni-
formly bounded random variables with
(3.3) E[ωj] = 0, j ∈ J.
Assumption 3.2. (fj)j∈J is a family of real-valued functions such that∑
j∈J |fj| is bounded and for some ρ > 1/2
∑
j∈J
E[ω2j ]
∫ ∞
0
(∫
Sd−1
|fj(rθ)| dθ
)2
(1 + r)2ρrd−1 dr <∞.
It follows from Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 that Vω is bounded,
(3.4) ‖Vω‖∞ ≤ C,
uniformly in ω. Theorem 2.1 will be deduced from the following
Theorem 3.3. Let d = 2, 3. Under Assumptions 3.1, 3.2 the wave operators
W±(Hω, H0) := s− lim
t→±∞
exp(itHω) exp(−itH0)P (ac)0
exist almost surely.
By general principle (see [30]) we deduce
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM 5
Corollary 3.4. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.3 one has
σac(H0) ⊂ σac(Hω) a.s.
3.2. Preliminary material. In this subsection we recall a simple result
needed in the proof of Theorem 3.3.
For κ ≥ −1
4
we define the operator Aκ in L2(R+) as the Friedrichs ex-
tension of − d2
dr2
+ κ
r2
on C∞0 (R+). Moreover, denote by Λ the operator
of multiplication by (1 + r). We are interested in compactness properties
of Λ−ρ(Aκ + I)−1. As usual, S1 and S2 denote the trace class and the
Hilbert-Schmidt class, respectively.
Lemma 3.5. Let κ ≥ − 1
4
. If ρ > 1
2
then
Λ−ρ(Aκ + I)−1 ∈ S2,
and if ρ > 1 then
Λ−ρ(Aκ + I)−1 ∈ S1.
Indeed, the operator Aκ can be diagonalized explicitly in terms of Bessel
functions. The second part of the assertion follows then from Lemma 2 in
[31]. By a direct estimate of the integral kernel we obtain the first part of
the assertion.
3.3. Proof of Theorem 3.3. We denote by Ym, m ∈ N, a complete or-
thonormal system of real-valued eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator in L2(Sd−1) and introduce the projections Pm in L2(Rd),
(Pmu)(x) := Ym(x/|x|)
∫
Sd−1
u(|x|θ)Ym(θ) dθ, x ∈ Rd.
Since
∑
m∈N Pm = I in the sense of strong convergence it suffices to prove
the almost sure existence of the wave operators
W±(Hω, H0, Pm) := s− lim
t→±∞
exp(itHω) exp(−itH0)P (ac)0 Pm =
= s− lim
t→±∞
exp(itHω)Pm exp(−itH0)P (ac)0 .
(3.5)
For this we will prove that for every bounded interval (a, b) ⊂ R
(3.6) Eω(a, b)VωPmE0(a, b) ∈ S1 a.s.,
where Eω, E0 denotes the spectral families of Hω, H0, respectively. Since
Pn maps D(H0) = H2(Rd) into D(H) = H2(Rd) the existence of the
limits (3.5) will then follow from Theorem 6.4.9 in [30].
In view of (3.1), (3.4) the operators
(H00 + I)E0(a, b) =
(
(H00 + I)(H0 + γI)
−1) ((H0 + γI)E0(a, b))
6 R. L. FRANK AND O. SAFRONOV
(for γ sufficiently large) and similarly Eω(a, b)(H00 + I) are bounded.
Hence the relation (3.6) is a consequence of
(H00 + I)
−1VωPm(H00 + I)−1 ∈ S1 a.s.
Similarly as before, we will denote by Λ the operator of multiplication by
(1 + |x|). With ρ > 1
2
from Assumption 3.2 we factorize
(H00 + I)
−1VωPm(H00 + I)−1 = B∗ωC
where
Bω := Λ
ρPmVω(H00 + I)
−1,
C := Λ−ρPm(H00 + I)−1.
One easily finds that the non-trivial part of the operator PmH00 is unitarily
equivalent to the operator Aκ defined in the previous subsection with some
κ ≥ 1/4 depending on m and d. From Lemma 3.5 we conclude that
C ∈ S2,
and so it remains to show that
(3.7) Bω ∈ S2 a.s.
It follows from Assumption 3.1 that
(3.8) E[‖Bω‖22] =
∑
j∈J
E[ω2j ]‖ΛρPmfj(H00 + I)−1‖22.
Now the kernel of ΛρPmfj(H00 + I)−1F∗, F being the Fourier transform,
is
(2pi)−d/2(1 + |x|)ρ(1 + |ξ|2)−1Ym(x/|x|)
∫
Sd−1
fj(|x|θ)Ym(θ)ei|x|〈θ,ξ〉 dθ.
Since Ym is a bounded function, the absolute value of this kernel can be
estimated by
C1(1 + |x|)ρ(1 + |ξ|2)−1
∫
Sd−1
|fj(|x|θ)| dθ,
and we find
‖ΛρPmfj(H00 + I)−1‖22 ≤ C2
∫ ∞
0
(∫
Sd−1
|fj(rθ)| dθ
)2
(1 + r)2ρrd−1 dr
with a finite constant C2 (since d ≤ 3), independent of j. Combining this
with (3.8) and Assumption 3.2 we conclude that
E[‖Bω‖22] <∞.
This implies (3.7) and finishes the proof of Theorem 3.3.
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM 7
Remark 3.6. The previous proof can be easily generalized to the case of the
polyharmonic operator. Indeed, if H00 = (−∆)l and Assumptions 3.1, 3.2
continue to hold, then the assertion of Theorem 3.3 remains true for d < 4l.
Remark 3.7. Note that we do not claim that the wave operators are com-
plete. Indeed, it follows easily from Theorem 5.4.5 in [30] that u ∈
R(W±(Hω, H0)) iff for all m ∈ N
Pm exp(−itHω)P (ac)ω u→ 0 as t→ ±∞.
Here P (ac)ω denotes the projection onto the absolutely continuous subspace
of Hω. We can conclude the completeness of the wave operators provided
this convergence is uniform in m.
3.4. Cone condition. Here we would like to give a ‘local’ version of The-
orem 3.3, which involves assumptions on the random potential only inside
a cone.
We fix a smooth (H2, say) real-valued function φ on the unit sphere Sd−1 of
norm one and introduce the cone
C := {x ∈ Rd : x/|x| ∈ supp(φ)}.
Again we define Vω by (3.2) and but now we subject the ωj and fj only to
Assumption 3.8. ω = (ωj)j∈J is a countable family of independent, uni-
formly bounded random variables with
E[ωj] = 0, ∀j ∈ J such that supp(fj) ∩ C 6= ∅.
Assumption 3.9. (fj)j∈J is a family of real-valued functions such that∑
j∈J |fj| is bounded and for some ρ > 1/2
∑
j∈J
E[ω2j ]
∫ ∞
0
(∫
Sd−1
|φ(θ)fj(rθ)| dθ
)2
(1 + r)2ρrd−1 dr <∞.
Note that Assumptions 3.8, 3.9 impose essential conditions on Vω only
inside the cone C.
We choose a real-valued function ζ ∈ C∞(R+) which vanishes near zero
and equals one in {r > 1}. Put
ψ(x) := c(|x|)
(
ζ(|x|)φ(x/|x|) + (1− ζ(|x|))
)
, x ∈ Rd,
where c(r) is chosen so that the norm of ψ(r·) in L2(Sd−1) is one,∫
Sd−1
|ψ(rθ)|2dθ = 1, r > 0.
8 R. L. FRANK AND O. SAFRONOV
We introduce the projection P in L2(Rd),
(Pu)(x) := ψ(x)
∫
Sd−1
ψ(|x|θ)u(|x|θ) dθ, x ∈ Rd,
and put P1 := I − P . We consider the operator
H⊕ := PH0P + P1H0P1.
Below we shall see that H⊕ is well-defined on D(H0). We denote by P (ac)⊕
the projection onto its absolutely continuous subspace. Then the analogue
of Theorem 3.3 is
Theorem 3.10. Let d = 2, 3. Under Assumptions 3.8, 3.9 the wave opera-
tors
W±(Hω, H⊕, P ) := s− lim
t→±∞
exp(itHω)P exp(−itH⊕)P (ac)0
exist almost surely.
Before we pass to the proof we would like to deduce information about
the absolutely continuous spectrum of the operator Hω. As is well-
known, if the wave operators exist then the part of Hω on the range
R(W±(Hω, H⊕, P )) of the wave operators is unitarily equivalent to the part
of H⊕ on
N (W±(Hω, H⊕, P ))⊥ = R(P (ac)⊕ P ).
This implies
Corollary 3.11. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.10 one has
σac(PH⊕P ) ⊂ σac(Hω) a.s.
Note that if V0 ≡ 0, i.e., H0 = H00 = −∆ then the absolutely continuous
spectrum of PH⊕P coincides with [0,∞).
Proof of Theorem 3.10. First of all we will prove that
(3.9) (H0 + γI)(H⊕ + γI)−1 ∈ B, (H⊕ + γI)(H0 + γI)−1 ∈ B
for all sufficiently large γ > 0. To this end we calculate
(3.10) H0 −H⊕ = 2 Re PH0P1 = 2 Re PH00P1 = −2 Re [H00, P ]P1
and note that [H00, P ] contains only combinations of projections and first
order differentiation. In particular, on {|x| > 1} one has
(3.11) [H00, P ] = |x|−2
(
(·,∆θφ)L2(Sd−1)φ− (·, φ)L2(Sd−1)∆θφ
)
,
where ∆θ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator in L2(Sd−1). We deduce
thatH⊕−H0 isH0-bounded with relative bound 0. This implies that the do-
mains of the operators H0 and H⊕ coincide and (3.9) follows by the closed
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM 9
graph theorem.
In order to prove Theorem 3.10 we will establish now that
(H⊕ + γI)−1P − P (Hω + γI)−1 =
= (H⊕ + γI)−1P (Hω −H⊕)(Hω + γI)−1 ∈ S1,
for sufficiently large γ > 0. Similar as in (3.10) we find that
P (Hω −H⊕) = PVω − P [H00, P ]P1,
so in view of (3.1), (3.4), (3.9) it suffices to establish the two inclusions
(3.12) (H⊕ + I)−1PVω(H00 + I)−1 ∈ S1,
(3.13) (H⊕ + I)−1P [H00, P ]P1(H⊕ + I)−1 ∈ S1.
We begin with the proof of (3.12) which is similar to the proof of Theorem
3.3. We will factorize the operator on the left hand side of (3.12) as a prod-
uct of operators from the Hilbert-Schmidt class. Replacing Assumptions
3.1, 3.2 above by Assumptions 3.8, 3.9 one verifies that
ΛρPVω(H00 + I)
−1 ∈ S2
with ρ > 1/2 from Assumption 3.9.
Now the non-trivial part of the operator PH⊕P is unitarily equivalent to a
second-order differential operator in L2(R+) with smooth coefficients. In a
neighborhood of zero it coincides with − d2
dr2
+κr−2, κ = (d− 1)(d− 3)/4,
and in {r > 1} with − d2
dr2
+ r−2(κ+ ‖∇φ‖2
L2(Sd−1)
). Thus it follows easily
from Lemma 3.5 that
Λ−ρP (H⊕ + I)−1 ∈ S2,
which concludes the proof of (3.12).
The proof of (3.13) uses similar ideas, but now we factorize the operator
on the left hand side as a product of a trace class and a bounded operator.
Indeed, one can use Lemma 3.5 again to prove that
Λ−αP (H⊕ + I)−1 ∈ S1
provided α > 1. Moreover, a simple analysis of the commutator [H00, P ]
(noting in particular (3.11)) shows that
ΛαP [H00, P ]P1(H⊕ + I)−1 ∈ B
provided α ≤ 2. This proves (3.13) and completes the proof of the theorem.

4. BACK TO THE MODEL FROM SECTION 2
4.1. Proof of Theorem 2.1. We are in the situation of Section 3 with V0 ≡
0 and J = N × Zd and have to verify Assumption 3.2. Then Theorem 2.1
will follow from Corollary 3.4.
It is elementary to see that there is a constant C1 > 0 such that for all
j ∈ Zd, ρ ≥ 1
(4.1)
∫
Sd−1
ξj(ρ θ) dθ ≤ C1ρ−(d−1)χ[|j|−√d,|j|+√d](ρ),
where χ[a,b] denotes the characteristic function of the interval [a, b]. Hence

Now the number of j ∈ Zd for which χ[|j|−√d,|j|+√d](ns) 6= 0 coincides
with the number of integer points in the spherical layer {ns −√d ≤ |x| ≤
ns +
√
d} and is hence bounded by C3ns(d−1). We conclude that the above
sum can be estimated by
C2C3
∑
n∈N
n−(s−1)(d−1)+2ρ.
Since s > 1 + 2/(d− 1) we can choose ρ > 1/2 such that (s− 1)(d− 1)−
2ρ > 1 and so Assumption 3.2 holds. This completes the proof of Theorem
2.1.
Before we move on we would like to mention some obvious general-
izations of the above proof. First, note that the assumption that the ωn,j
are identically distributed was not used. It suffices that they are uniformly
bounded (see Example 5.3 below). Second, the precise form of the func-
tions fn,j is not essential. We only used the estimate (4.1) and a bound on
the number of functions supported inside a given spherical layer.
4.2. Extension to higher dimensions. It turns out that the conclusion of
Theorem 2.1 holds also for dimensions d ≥ 4. We give the proof only in
the setting of Section 2 but remark that various generalizations are possible.
Finally, we believe that the critical value on s can be improved.
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM 11
Theorem 4.1. Let d ≥ 4 and let s > 1 + d/(d − 1). Then the absolutely
continuous spectrum of the operator−∆+Vω contains [0,∞) almost surely.
Proof. We proceed as in the proof of Theorem 3.3 and factorize again
(−∆ + I)−1VωPm(−∆ + I)−1 = B∗ωC
where
Bω := Λ
ρPmVω(−∆ + I)−1,
C := Λ−ρPm(−∆ + I)−1.
However, now we choose
(4.2) ρ > 1,
so that Lemma 3.5 yields C ∈ S1. Hence it remains to show that
(4.3) Bω ∈ B a.s.
We will localize in the configuration and in the momentum space. Recall
that χn is the characteristic function of the spherical layer {n−1 ≤ |x| < n}
and put Jn := E00(0, n2ρ) where E00 is the spectral family of−∆. We have
(4.4) E[‖Bω‖] ≤
∑
n∈N
E[‖χnBω(I − Jn)‖] +
∑
n∈N
E[‖χnBωJn‖].
For high energies we use that
‖(−∆ + I)−1(I − Jn)‖ ≤ n−2ρ
and obtain the deterministic estimate
‖χnBω(I − Jn)‖ ≤ C1n−ρ.
Hence the first sum in (4.4) is finite in view of (4.2).
For low energies we calculate similarly as in the proof of Theorem 3.3 that
(4.5)
(E[‖χnBωJn‖])2 ≤ E[‖χnBωJn‖22] = C2
∑
j∈Zd
‖ΛρPmfn,j(−∆ + I)−1Jn‖22,
where C2 is the (common) variance of the ωn,j . Since Ym is a bounded
function, the absolute value of the kernel of ΛρPmfn,j(−∆+ I)−1JnF∗ can
be estimated by
C3(1 + |x|)ρ(1 + |ξ|2)−1χ[n−1,n)(|x|)χ(0,nρ)(|ξ|)
∫

Obviously, one has∫

and, provided d ≥ 5, ∫
|ξ|<nρ
dξ
(1 + |ξ|2)2 ≤ C5n
(d−4)ρ.
(If d = 4 the argument is similar, so we restrict ourselves henceforth to the
case d ≥ 5.) Combining this with the estimate (4.1) we find
‖ΛρPmfn,j(−∆ + I)−1Jn‖22 ≤ C6n−(2s−1)(d−1)+(d−2)ρχ[|j|−√d,|j|+√d](ns).
As in the previous subsection we estimate the number of j ∈ Zd for which
χ[|j|−
√
d,|j|+
√
d](n
s) 6= 0 by C7ns(d−1), and obtain so from (4.5) the bound
(E[‖χnBωJn‖])2 ≤ C8n−(s−1)(d−1)+(d−2)ρ.
Hence the second sum in (4.4) is finite if we choose ρ > 1 such that
(s− 1)(d− 1)− (d− 2)ρ > 2,
(which is possible since s > 1 + d/(d− 1)). We conclude that
E[‖Bω‖] <∞.
This implies (4.3) and finishes the proof of Theorem 4.1. ¤
5. FURTHER EXAMPLES
Finally, we would like to show that our method is not restricted to the
model from Section 2 but yields the existence of absolutely continuous
spectrum also in other situations, e.g., with sparse potentials or decaying
randomness. In each case the proof reduces to the verification of Assump-
tion 3.2. We emphasize that this assumption allows to combine different
mechanisms for absolutely continuous spectrum and that their influence is
essentially additive.
Example 5.1 (Additional decay). Let d = 2, 3 and define fn,j as in Section
2, depending on the parameter s > 1. Moreover, let (αn,j) be a deterministic
sequence of real numbers satisfying
|αn,j| ≤ Cn−t, n ∈ N, j ∈ Zd,
with some parameter t ≥ 0. We define now
Vω(x) =

where ωn,j are as in Section 2.
If t > 1 this is a short-range potential and standard deterministic results are
applicable. If t > 1/2 the almost sure existence of absolutely continuous
spectrum is proven in [5], [10] for s = 1. We will show that absolutely
continuous spectrum exists almost surely for all t ≥ 0 at the expense of
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM 13
increasing s. Put differently, decay (i.e., t > 0) helps to decrease the lower
bound on s in Theorem 2.1. Indeed, a straightforward generalization of the
proof in Subsection 4.1 shows that [0,∞) is almost surely contained in the
absolutely continuous spectrum of −∆ + Vω provided
s > 1 + 2(1− t)/(d− 1).
Example 5.2 (Sparse potentials). Let d = 3 and f ∈ L∞(R3) with compact
support. Let (xm)m∈N be a sequence of points in R3 such that |xm| → ∞
but ∑
m∈N
|xm|−σ <∞
for some σ < 1 and put
Wω˜(x) :=
∑
m∈N
ω˜mf(x− xm), x ∈ R3,
where ω˜m, m ∈ N, are bounded, independent and identically distributed
random variables with E[ω˜m] = 0.
We claim that [0,∞) is almost surely contained in the absolutely continuous
spectrum of −∆ +Wω. Indeed, proceeding as in Subsection 4.1 and using
an analogue of the estimate (4.1) we find that
∑

which is finite for ρ = 1 − σ/2 > 1/2. We note that −∆ + Wω˜ has non-
empty essential spectrum below zero whenever f is sufficiently negative.
The same idea can be used to construct negative essential spectrum for the
operator from Section 2. Let Vω be of the same form as there with ωn,j
independent from ω˜m. Since Vω and Wω˜ satisfy Assumption 3.2 their sum
does so as well. We conclude that −∆ + Vω +Wω˜ has almost surely abso-
lutely continuous spectrum in [0,∞) and also, if f is sufficiently negative,
essential spectrum below zero.
Example 5.3 (Decaying randomness). We return once more to the model
from Section 2. Let d = 2, 3 and let fn,j and Vω be defined as before, but
assume now that the ωn,j are not identically distributed. For the sake of
definiteness assume that they are independent random variables assuming
only the values −1, 0, 1 with
P[ωn,j = 1] = P[ωn,j = −1] =: pn,j/2, n ∈ N, j ∈ Zd.
We assume that
(5.1) |pn,j| ≤ Cn−τ , n ∈ N, j ∈ Zd,

with some parameter τ > 0. Then the set [0,∞) is almost surely contained
in the absolutely continuous spectrum of the operator −∆ + αVω, α ∈ R,
provided
(5.2) s > 1 + (2− τ)/(d− 1).
This follows as in Subsection 4.1 but taking now also into account that
E[ω2n,j] = pn,j . Note that if
(5.3)
∑
n∈N,j∈Zd
pn,jχ[|j|−
√
d,|j|+
√
d](n
s) <∞,
then Vω is almost surely compactly supported by the Borel-Cantelli lemma,
so the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum is trivial in this case.
If, however, d = 3 one can choose pn,j such that (5.1) holds with τ > 2
and simultaneously the sum in (5.3) is infinite. Then (5.2) guarantees the
almost sure existence of absolutely continuous spectrum on [0,∞) in the
case s = 1. At the same time the existence of a infinite sequence of variables
ωn,j assuming the value −1 might yield the existence of negative essential
spectrum for sufficiently large |α|. We refer to [15] for a more detailed
analysis of the negative essential spectrum in related models (see also [23]).
Finally, we remark that the cone condition from Subsection 3.4 allows
to construct a lot of further examples having both positive absolutely con-
tinuous and negative essential spectrum. In particular, one can consider the
potential of the usual Anderson model and modify it in an arbitrary small
cone in one of the described ways to produce absolutely continuous spec-
trum on the positive half-line.
As we mentioned before the main result of our paper does not have one-
dimensional analogues simply because the unit sphere in d = 1 consists
only of two points. However, one can consider the following elementary
Example 5.4. Let χn,j be the characteristic function of the interval [n +
jn−s, n+(j+1)n−s) where n ∈ Z, 0 ≤ j < [ns], and [ns] notes the integer
part of ns. Let ωn,j be bounded, independent and identically distributed
random variables with E[ωn,j] = 0 and define
Vω(x) :=
∑
n
∑
0≤j<[ns]
ωn,jn
−1/4−²χn,j(x), x ∈ R.
Now we prove the following result.
Theorem 5.5. Let s ≥ 1/2. Then the absolutely continuous spectrum of the
operator−d2/dx2+Vω is almost surely essentially supported by [0,∞), i.e.,
the spectral measure has positive derivative almost everywhere on [0,∞).
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM 15
One might conjecture that for 0 < s < 1/2−² the operator−d2/dx2+Vω
has almost surely dense purely point spectrum on [0,∞).
Proof. We consider the Fourier transform
Vˆω(ξ) = (2pi)
−1/2
∫
R
e−iξxVω(x) dx =
∑
n
∑
0≤j<[ns]
ωn,jn
−1/4−²χˆn,j(ξ)
and note that |χˆn,j(ξ)| ≤ C1n−s for all ξ with a constant C1 independent of
j, n. Hence for any finite interval (a, b)
E
[∫ b

and the sum on the right hand side converges. Since the Fourier transform
of Vω belongs almost surely to L2,loc and Vω ∈ L4, the assertion follows
from the main result of [16]. (By the trick from [22] the L3-condition in
[16] can be substituted by a L4-condition.) ¤
