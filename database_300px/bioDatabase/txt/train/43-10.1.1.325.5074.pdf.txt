One potential approach for characterizing uncultivated prokaryotes from natural assemblages involves
genomic analysis of DNA fragments retrieved directly from naturally occurring microbial biomass. In this
study, we sought to isolate large genomic fragments from a widely distributed and relatively abundant but as
yet uncultivated group of prokaryotes, the planktonic marine Archaea. A fosmid DNA library was prepared
from a marine picoplankton assemblage collected at a depth of 200 m in the eastern North Pacific. We
identified a 38.5-kbp recombinant fosmid clone which contained an archaeal small subunit ribosomal DNA
gene. Phylogenetic analyses of the small subunit rRNA sequence demonstrated its close relationship to that of
previously described planktonic archaea, which form a coherent group rooted deeply within the Crenarchaeota
branch of the domain Archaea. Random shotgun sequencing of subcloned fragments of the archaeal fosmid
clone revealed several genes which bore highest similarity to archaeal homologs, including large subunit
ribosomal DNA and translation elongation factor 2 (EF2). Analyses of the inferred amino acid sequence of
archaeoplankton EF2 supported its affiliation with the Crenarchaeote subdivision of Archaea. Two gene frag-
ments encoding proteins not previously found in Archaea were also identified: RNA helicase, responsible for the
ATP-dependent alteration of RNA secondary structure, and glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase, an
enzyme involved in initial steps of heme biosynthesis. In total, our results indicate that genomic analysis of
large DNA fragments retrieved from mixed microbial assemblages can provide useful perspective on the
physiological potential of abundant but as yet uncultivated prokaryotes.
Characterization of complex microbial communities by iso-
lation and analysis of phylogenetically informative gene se-
quences has been an exciting development in microbiology (27,
32). Studies using molecular phylogenetic approaches based on
small subunit (ssu) rRNA sequence analyses have resulted in
new estimates of the phylogenetic diversity contained within
naturally occurring microbial assemblages. Entirely new phy-
logenetic lineages, which may sometimes represent major con-
stituents of natural microbial communities, have been revealed
by using such approaches (3, 4, 7, 13, 16, 22, 29). Although
results of these studies have contributed substantially to assess-
ments of naturally occurring microbial diversity, their utility as
predictors of the physiological attributes of newly described
phylotypes has been more limited. This is partly because many
phylogenetically coherent prokaryote lineages, for example,
the proteobacteria, often encompass a bewildering array of
physiological and metabolic diversity. The problem is further
complicated by the fact that many of the newly discovered
phylotypes revealed by molecular phylogenetic analysis are
proving difficult to enrich and isolate in pure culture. These
limitations suggest the need for alternative approaches to char-
acterize the physiological and metabolic potential of as yet
uncultivated microorganisms, which to date have been charac-
terized solely by analyses of PCR-amplified rRNA gene frag-
ments, clonally recovered from mixed assemblage nucleic ac-
ids.
Recent work has demonstrated that prokaryotes of the do-
main Archaea (35, 37) are more phylogenetically diverse and
ecologically widespread than has been previously suspected (3,
7, 13, 24). Marine planktonic archaea have now been shown to
occur in relatively high abundance in a variety of marine plank-
tonic environments. For instance, in surface waters of Antarc-
tica during late winter, as well as in subsurface waters of coastal
temperate regions, planktonic marine archaeal rRNA can ac-
count for a significant fraction (5 to 35%) of the total pico-
plankton rRNA (7, 8). These and other data indicate that
archaeoplankton are widespread, abundant components of
marine picoplankton and presumably are important partici-
pants in microbially mediated cycling of energy and matter in
the sea. Specific relatives of the crenarchaeote-affiliated ma-
rine archaea have also been detected in soil microbial assem-
blages indicating their further diversification (33a).
Although the genotypic and phenotypic properties of marine
pelagic archaea are unknown at present, their abundance and
ecological distribution suggest that they may represent entirely
new phenotypic groups within the domain Archaea. Available
data on these microorganisms consist solely of quantitative
estimates of their abundance and distribution derived from ssu
rRNA hybridization experiments (7, 8) or of the recovery and
sequence analysis of PCR-amplified rRNA gene fragments (7,

8, 13, 14, 24). To date, no successful attempts at cultivation and
characterization of these microorganisms has been reported.
In an effort to obtain additional information on marine
planktonic archaea, and to avoid uncertainties and limitations
imposed by PCR amplification or cultivation approaches, we
attempted to archive and stably propagate large fragments of
genomic DNA from these as yet uncultivated prokaryotes.
Using a recently constructed cloning vector derived from the
Escherichia coli F factor, the fosmid (for F-factor-based cosmid
[20]), we accessed genomic information from naturally occur-
ring picoplankton by archiving their genome fragments in the
form of a stable environmental DNA library. This report de-
scribes the construction of an environmental library from
coastal marine picoplankton (planktonic microorganisms ap-
proximately 0.2 to 2 mm in size) and preliminary genomic
characterization of as yet uncultivated marine archaea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell collection and preparation of DNA. Agarose plugs containing concen-
trated picoplankton cells were prepared from samples collected on an oceano-
graphic cruise from Newport, Oregon, to Honolulu, Hawaii, in the fall of 1992.
Seawater (30 liters) was collected in Niskin bottles, screened through 10-mm-
pore-size Nitex filters, and concentrated by hollow fiber filtration (Amicon
DC10) through 30,000-molecular weight-cutoff polysulfone filters. The concen-
trated bacterioplankton cells were collected on a 0.22 mm-pore-size, 47-mm-
diameter Durapore filter and resuspended in 1 ml of 23 STE buffer (1 M NaCl,
0.1 M EDTA [pH 8.0], 10 mM Tris [pH 8.0]) to a final density of approximately
1010 cells per ml. The cell suspension was mixed with 1 volume of 1% molten
SeaPlaque LMP agarose (FMC), cooled to 408C, and then immediately drawn
into a 1-ml syringe. The syringe was sealed with Parafilm and placed on ice for
10 min. The cell-containing agarose plug was extruded into 10 ml of lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA, 1% Sarkosyl, 0.2% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mg of lysozyme per ml) and incubated at 378C for 1 h. The
agarose plug was then transferred to 40 ml of ESP buffer (1% Sarkosyl–1 mg of
proteinase K per ml in 0.5 M EDTA), and incubated at 558C for 16 h. The
solution was decanted, replaced with fresh ESP buffer, and incubated at 558C for
an additional hour. The agarose plugs were then placed in 50 mM EDTA and
stored at 48C shipboard for the duration of the oceanographic cruise. After
disembarkation, samples were transported in insulated containers containing ice
packs to the University of California, Santa Barbara. At some collection sites,
parallel samples were collected on Durapore filters and frozen for later analysis
of relative archaeal rRNA abundance as previously described (7, 8, 28, 31).
Screening of agarose plugs for archaeal DNA. Lysates were prepared from the
agarose plugs, and the DNA was screened for the presence of archaeal ssu
ribosomal DNA (rDNA), using eubacterium- and archaeon-biased oligonucleo-
tide primers and PCR amplification conditions previously described (7). Approx-
imately 400 ml of each agarose plug was melted at 658C for 10 min, cooled to
408C, and digested for 1 h with 2 U of Gelase (Epicentre) as recommended by
the manufacturer. After digestion, the lysate was extracted once with phenol-
chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), washed twice with approximately 10 vol-
umes of sterile water (Millipore) in a microconcentrater (Centricon 100; Ami-
con), and resuspended in a final volume of 100 ml of TE (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0],
1 mM EDTA). One microliter of each extract was used in subsequent eubacte-
rium- or archaeon-specific ssu rDNA PCR amplifications (7). Amplification
products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Preparation and cloning of picoplankton DNA. A picoplankton sample col-
lected at a depth of 200 m off the Oregon coast (44802.729N, 124857.309W) on
August 29, 1992, was found to contain relatively high levels of archaeal DNA,
using the archaeal PCR assay. Quantitative hybridization experiments using
archaeon-specific oligonucleotide probes indicated that '4.7% of the total
rRNA in this sample was archaeal in origin (8). One slice of an agarose plug (72
ml) prepared from this sample was dialyzed overnight at 48C against 1 ml of
buffer A (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM bis Tris propane-HCl, 100 mg of acetylated
bovine serum albumin per ml [pH 7.0 at 258C]) in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube.
The solution was replaced with 250 ml of fresh buffer A containing 10 mMMgCl2
and 1 mM dithiothreitol and incubated on a rocking platform for 1 h at room
temperature. The solution was then changed to 250 ml of the same buffer
containing 4 U of Sau3AI (New England Biolabs), equilibrated to 378C in a water
bath, and then incubated on a rocking platform in a 378C incubator for 45 min.
The plug was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 688C
for 30 min to inactivate the enzyme and melt the agarose. The agarose was
digested and the DNA was dephosphorylated by using Gelase and HK phos-
phatase (Epicentre), respectively, as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein
was removed by gentle phenol-chloroform extraction, and the DNA was ethanol
precipitated, pelleted, and then washed with 70% ethanol. This partially digested
DNA was resuspended in sterile H2O to a concentration of 25 ng/ml for ligation
to the pFOS1 vector.
Vector arms were prepared from pFOS1 as described previously (20). Briefly,
the plasmid was completely digested with AatII, dephosphorylated with HK
phosphatase, and then digested with BamHI to generate two arms, each of which
contained a cos site in the proper orientation for cloning and packaging ligated
DNA between 35 and 45 kbp in size. The partially digested picoplankton DNA
was ligated overnight to the pFOS1 arms in a 15-ml ligation reaction mixture
containing 25 ng each of vector and insert and 1 U of T4 DNA ligase (Boehringer
Mannheim). The ligated DNA in 4 ml of this reaction mixture was in vitro
packaged by using the Gigapack XL packaging system (Stratagene), the fosmid
particles were transfected to Escherichia coli DH10B (Bethesda Research Lab-
oratories), and the cells were spread onto LBcm15 plates. The resultant fosmid
clones were picked into 96-well microtiter dishes containing LBcm15 supple-
mented with 7% glycerol. This library was stored frozen at 2808C for later
analysis.
Screening for archaeal clones. Multiplex PCR screening using archaeon-bi-
ased ssu rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide primers was used to identify fosmid
clones containing archaeal rRNA genes (7). Pools of all clones contained in a
single microtiter dish were inoculated into 5 ml of SOB medium containing 12.5
mg of chloramphenicol per ml and grown overnight at 378C. Fosmids of each pool
were extracted by using a standard alkaline lysis procedure (20). One microliter
of each fosmid DNA pool, representing one microtiter plate, was used in 50-ml
PCRs performed with archaeon-biased ssu rDNA primers. Microtiter dishes
which tested positive with the archaeal rDNA primers were further screened by
PCRs performed on row and column fosmid pools from that microtiter dish.
For further screening, high-density filter replicas of the fosmid library were
generated by stamping the contents of the microtiter dishes in a five-by-five array
onto nylon filters, using a Biomek 1000 workstation with attached high-density
replicating tool (Beckman). The filters were stamped on a bed of LBcm15 agar in
a microtiter dish lid and allowed to incubate overnight at 378C to allow colony
growth. Colonies were lysed, and DNA was fixed on the filters by using a turbo
prep protocol in which the filters were laid on Whatman paper saturated with 23
SSC (13 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate)–5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) for 2 min and then microwaved at the highest power setting for 2.5
min on a turntable. The filters were then submerged in 20 ml of a solution
containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% (wt/vol)
sodium lauryl sarcosine (Sarkosyl), and 250 mg of proteinase K per ml and
incubated at 458C for 30 min. After removal from the solution, the filters were air
dried at 558C and the DNA was UV cross-linked with a Stratalinker (Stratagene).
An archaeal rDNA-containing fosmid clone (clone 4B7) was identified, puri-
fied, and subsequently digested with NotI to excise the cloned insert and sepa-
rated on a 1% SeaKem agarose gel (FMC), using a CHEF DRII pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). The electrophoresis conditions were as
follows: 198 V, 5-s switch interval, 20-h run time, in 13 Tris-acetate-EDTA
buffer at 148C. The cloned inserts were visualized with ethidium bromide stain-
ing, excised from the gel, and purified by using a Geneclean kit (Bio 101).
Approximately 25 ng of the fragment was labeled with 32P by random priming
(Prime-It II; Stratagene) and hybridized to the high-density filters to identify
potential contigs of the 16S containing clones. The filters were first prehybridized
2 h at 658C in a blocking solution containing 53 SSC, 1.0% blocking reagent
(Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% Sarkosyl, and 0.02% SDS. The labeled insert was
added to this solution and allowed to hybridize overnight at the same tempera-
ture. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice for 15 min each time at
room temperature in 23 SSC–0.1% SDS and then twice for 15 min each time at
658C in 0.53 SSC–0.1% SDS. The filters were then exposed to autoradiographic
film (Kodak X-Omat) for 3 to 16 h at 2808C.
Subcloning and sequencing. A subclone library of fosmid 4B7 was prepared by
digesting fosmid DNA with either EcoRI, EcoRI and BamHI, or SpeI. The
restriction fragments were subcloned into Bluescript vector SK1, which had
been digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and subsequently
treated with HK phosphatase. Plasmid minipreparations of the fosmid subclones
were prepared by alkaline lysis, and 200 to 300 bases of nucleotide sequence was
determined for each end of the insert, using M13 forward and reverse primers
and Sequenase 2.0 (United States Biochemical). Partial fosmid subclone se-
quences were compared with entries in the nonredundant protein and nucleic
acid databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information server,
using BLASTN or BLASTX (1, 17).
The entire ssu rRNA gene contained on subclone 2i was sequenced in the
forward and reverse directions, using rDNA-targeted oligonucleotide primers
(21) and Sequenase 2.0 (United States Biochemical) as recommended by the
manufacturer for double-stranded plasmid sequencing. The nucleotide sequence
of the translation elongation factor 2 (EF2) gene was contained on two overlap-
ping subclones of fosmid 4B7, subclone 3B (amino acid residues 410 to 725), and
subclone B2 (amino acid residues 1 to 705). Sequencing was performed in the
forward and reverse directions by primer walking, using the following oligode-
oxynucleotide primers: EF3B-1r (CTC AGG AAC CTC ACC), EF3B-1f (CAA
ATA TTA CGT GAT), EF2-2f (GTT ATT GCA CAC GTA), EF2-2r (TTC
TTA CCT GTT CTT TTG), EF-3f (CGA GTA AGA CCT GTA), EF-3r (CAG
AAA AGT CAA CGT), EF-4f (GGT GTT ATT GCA CAC), EF-4r (TAA TAC
ACC CAT TCC), EF-5f (TTT GGT TCT GCA AAA), EF-6f (GCA CAA AAG
TAT AGA), EF-5r (ACC AGT CTC TTC ATC), EF-6r (GTG ATT GTT TCT
CTG), EFend-f (CAAGGTAAA CGTGGTAAAG), and EFend-r (GGT TTT

Restriction mapping. Large genomic fragments isolated from fosmid clones
were mapped by partial and double digestion with various restriction endonucle-
ases. When the subclone sizes exceeded 10 kb, the F-factor-based vector
pBAC108L (30) was used to accommodate the fosmid subfragments. Partial
digestions were performed by adding 2.5 U of restriction enzyme to 1 mg of
NotI-digested clone DNA in a 30-ml reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was
incubated at 378C, and 10-ml aliquots were removed at 10, 40, and 60 min.
Restriction digestions were terminated by adding 1 ml of 0.5 M EDTA to the
reaction mixtures and placing the tubes on ice. The partially digested DNA was
separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis as described above except using a 1-
to 3-s ramped switch time at 100 V for 16 h. The sizes of the separated fragments
were determined relative to those of known standards. The distances of the
restriction sites relative to the terminal T7 and SP6 promoter sites on the excised
cassette were determined by end labeling 10 pmol of T7- or SP6-specific oligo-
nucleotides with [g-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol) and hybridizing with Southern
blots of the gels.
Southern blots of agarose gels containing fosmid and pBAC clones digested
with two or more restriction enzymes were probed with labeled T7 and SP6
oligonucleotides as well as random-prime-labeled subclones and PCR fragments
carrying gene sequences identified from the shotgun sequencing described above.
This information was correlated with the size estimates from the partial diges-
tions to generate physical and genetic maps of the fosmids and their subclones.
Phylogenetic analysis. Sequence alignment and DeSoete distance (9) analyses
were performed on a Sun Sparc 10 workstation using GDE 2.2 and Treetool 1.0,
obtained from the ribosomal database project (RDP) (23). DeSoete least squares
distance analyses (9) were performed by using pairwise evolutionary distances,
calculated by using the correction of Olsen to account for empirical base fre-
quencies (34). Reference sequences were obtained from the RDP, version 4.0
(23). Maximum likelihood analyses (10) of ssu rRNA sequences were performed
by using fastDNAml 1.0 (25), obtained from the RDP. For distance analyses of
the inferred amino acid sequence of EF2, evolutionary distances were estimated
by using the Phylip program (12) Protdist, and tree topology was inferred by the
Fitch-Margoliash method, using random taxon addition and global branch swap-
ping. For maximum parsimony analyses of protein sequences, the Phylip pro-
gram Protpars was used with random taxon addition and ordinary parsimony
options.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Partial sequences reported in Table
1 have been submitted to GenBank under the following accession numbers:
U40238, U40239, U40240, U40241, U40242, U40243, U40244, and U40245. The
nucleotide sequences encoding ssu rRNA and EF2 have been submitted to
GenBank under accession numbers U39635 and U41261.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows an overview of the procedures used to con-
struct an environmental library from the mixed picoplankton
sample. Our goal was to construct a stable, large insert DNA
library representing picoplankton genomic DNA, in order to
gain information about the genetic and physiological potential
of one constituent group in this community, the planktonic
marine Crenarchaeota. Agarose plugs containing high-molecu-
lar-weight picoplankton DNA were prepared by concentrating
cells from 30 liters of seawater, using hollow fiber filtration.
These agarose plugs, representing picoplankton collected from
a variety of sites and depths in the eastern North Pacific, were
screened for the presence of archaebacteria by using both
eubacterium-biased (to test for positive amplification) and ar-
chaeon-biased rDNA primers. PCR amplification results from
several of the agarose plugs (data not shown) indicated the
presence of significant amounts of archaeal DNA. Quantitative
hybridization experiments using rRNA extracted from one
sample, collected at a depth of 200 m off the Oregon coast,
indicated that planktonic archaea in this assemblage comprised
approximately 4.7% of the total picoplankton biomass (this
sample corresponds to ‘‘PAC1’’-200 m in Table 1 of reference
8). Results from archaeon-biased rDNA PCR amplification
performed on agarose plug lysates confirmed the presence of
relatively large amounts of archaeal DNA in this sample. Aga-
rose plugs prepared from this picoplankton sample were cho-
sen for subsequent fosmid library preparation. Each 1-ml aga-
rose plug from this site contained approximately 7.5 3 109
cells; therefore, approximately 5.4 3 108 cells were present in
the 72-ml slice used in the preparation of the partially digested
DNA.
Recombinant fosmids, each containing ca. 40 kb of pico-
plankton DNA insert, yielded a library of 3,552 fosmid clones,
containing approximately 1.4 3 108 bp of cloned DNA. All of
the clones examined contained inserts ranging in size from 38
to 42 kbp (Fig. 2). Both the multiplex PCR (Fig. 3) and the
hybridization experiments suggested that well B7 on microtiter

dish 4 contained a clone encoding a 16S rDNA gene specific to
the archaea. This clone, designated 4B7, was selected for more
detailed examination. Using the cloned 4B7 fragment as a
probe, we did not detect other cloned fragments in the fosmid
library that contained overlapping regions (Fig. 4). No other
archaeal ssu rRNA genes were detected in the library.
Sequence analysis and identification of protein- and rRNA-
encoding genes. Fragments of archaeal DNA contained in the
4B7 insert were subcloned by digesting the fosmid with either
EcoRI, EcoRI plus BamHI, or SpeI. The resulting restriction
fragments were recovered in Bluescript vector (Stratagene),
and the distal 200 to 300 nucleotides of each subclone were
sequenced by using M13 forward and reverse sequencing prim-
ers. Of a total of 18 subclones analyzed in this fashion, 6 (33%)
contained nucleotide sequences with significant identity to pre-
viously characterized genes archived in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information nucleic acid or protein nonredun-
dant database. Table 1 shows the rank order similarity of
subclone sequences which share significant similarity to known
sequences, based on Poisson probabilities of random homol-
ogy [P(n)] (1, 17). Putative genes contained on fosmid 4B7
identified in this fashion include EF2, glutamate 1-semialde-
hyde aminotransferase (GSAT), RNA helicase, DnaJ, ssu
rRNA, and large subunit (lsu) rRNA. Three of these nucle-
otide sequences (EF2, lsu rRNA, and ssu rRNA) are most
similar to known archaeal homologs. Relatively high P(n) val-
ues obtained with the DnaJ (subclone 22K-R) and lsu rRNA
(Spe14-R) sequences are due to the fact that only a small
portion of each of these subcloned fragments encodes the
indicated homolog.
Gene organization. The results of the sequence analyses of
subclones containing the 16S-23S rRNA operon, GSAT, EF2,
and RNA helicase were used to confirm the locations of re-
striction sites determined by partial and double digestions. The
sequenced genes mapped to the distal BamHI-NotI fragments
of the 38.5-kbp insert in clone 4B7 (Fig. 5). The GSAT gene
and the 16S-23S operon reside on one of these fragments and
are transcribed in the same direction. We have not found
evidence for a 5S rRNA gene encoded on the 4B7 clone. The
genes encoding RNA helicase and EF2 were on the distal
BamHI-NotI fragment. The distal location of the archaeo-
plankton EF2 gene relative to the rRNA operon on clone 4B7,
as well as the striking similarities of fosmid-encoded EF2 and
ssu and lsu rRNA genes to archaeal homologs (Table 1), pro-
vides evidence that the 4B7 fosmid insert represents a contig-
uous genomic fragment from a planktonic marine archaeon.

clones containing either 23S or 16S rRNA (Table 1) indicated
that the ssu and lsu rRNA genes are adjacent to one another
on fosmid 4B7 (Fig. 5). Phylogenetic analysis indicated the
close relationship of the cloned rRNA gene sequence to se-
quences of a group of marine planktonic Crenarchaeota previ-
ously identified in PCR-based, molecular phylogenetic envi-
ronmental surveys (7, 8, 13) (Fig. 6). The GC content of the
rDNA gene found on fosmid 4B7 is relatively low (51.7% GC),
similar to that found in PCR-amplified, planktonic crenarcha-
eotal rDNA fragments. Sequence similarities between the fos-
mid-encoded ssu rRNA and PCR-amplified rDNA fragments
previously retrieved from other planktonic Crenarchaeota (7, 8,
13) ranged from 92 to 95% unrestricted sequence similarity.
Maximum likelihood analyses of the full ssu rRNA sequence
placed the fosmid-encoded ssu rRNA sequence within the
Crenarchaeota branch of the domain Archaea in 217 (87%) of
250 bootstrap replicate analyses (Fig. 6B).
The EF2 amino acid sequence bore highest overall similarity
with the EF2 genes of Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus
acidocaldarius, as indicated by sequence similarities (49.1 and
47.8% similarity, counting conservative replacements, respec-
tively) and P(n) values (1). The DNA sequence of fosmid-en-
coded EF2 was also most similar to that of S. solfataricus and
S. acidocaldarius. Conserved sequence motifs characteristic of
EF2s and other GTP-binding proteins are also present and
conserved in the inferred planktonic archaeal EF2 protein
sequence (Fig. 7). In addition, a conserved amino acid se-
quence motif surrounding the diphtheria toxin-sensitive, ADP-
ribosylatable histidine residue (2, 5) is also present in the
amino acid sequence of the cloned EF2 (Fig. 7). Both distance
and parsimony analyses of the amino acid sequence of EF2
also indicated that the planktonic archaeal EF2 sequence is
most closely related to other crenarchaeotal EF2 sequences, at
high bootstrap confidence levels (90 and 74%, respectively)
(Fig. 8).
DISCUSSION
We initiated this study to further understand the genetic
properties, physiological potential, and ecological significance
of planktonic marine archaea, which previously had been char-
acterized solely on the basis of ssu rRNA gene sequences. Our
approach consisted of cloning random fragments of picoplank-
ton DNA into an F-factor-based fosmid cloning vector, which
provided an environmental library composed of the genomic
DNA from the mixed picoplankton assemblage. Because the
pFOS1 vector was designed to accommodate and propagate
large genomic fragments with a high degree of fidelity (20, 30),
we reasoned that the composition of such a library would likely
reflect the composition of the sample and that the individual
clones would accurately preserve the arrangement of cloned
genes. Since an average-size fosmid clone represents approxi-
mately 2% of a typical archaeal genome, our approach has

allowed us to identify intact genes, operons, and their control
regions on a single cloned fragment.
Using the archaeal ssu rDNA as a phylogenetic marker, we
identified a 38.5-kb fragment in clone 4B7 that contains an
archaeal rDNA operon. Several different screening techniques
suggested that 4B7 was the only archaeal rDNA-containing
clone in the entire library. Assuming that the average genome
size of planktonic archaea is about half of that of eubacterial
picoplankton and that archaeal cells comprised a maximum of
5% of the total population sampled, a total of 89 archaeal
clones would be expected in our fosmid library composed of
3,552 clones. If planktonic marine Crenarchaeota contain only
one rDNA operon per genome, as do all other characterized
Crenarchaeota (33), then approximately 1/50 of the total ar-
chaeal clones [(40,000 bp per clone)/(2 3 106 bp/1 rDNA
operon)] should contain an rDNA operon. If the above-men-
tioned assumptions concerning rDNA copy number and plank-
tonic archaeal genome size are correct, the recovery of only a
single archaeal rDNA-containing clone in a library containing
a total of 3,552 40-kbp clones is not unexpected.
Phylogenetic analyses of the rRNA gene encoded on fosmid
4B7 indicated its affiliation with a crenarchaeotal group of
Archaea, members of which were previously identified solely by
analyses of PCR-amplified rDNA fragments (7, 8, 13, 24) (Fig.
6A). Maximum likelihood analysis of the full ssu rRNA se-
quence encoded on fosmid 4B7 support the affiliation of this
group with the Crenarchaeota at reasonably high bootstrap
confidence levels (87%; Fig. 6B and references 11 and 38).
This result is consistent with transversion signature analyses of
rDNA sequences of members of this archaeal group (35a) as
well as analyses of the higher-order structure of the rDNA
operon contained on fosmid 4B7 (23a, 33). However, large
differences in base composition between marine planktonic
Crenarchaeota rDNA ('51% G1C) and that of their putative
thermophilic crenarchaeotal relatives ('62 to 67% G1C [36])
complicates interpretation of rDNA-based phylogenies. In
this context, phylogenetic analyses of inferred amino acid se-
quences of protein-encoding genes may be useful for resolving
phylogenetic affiliation of this divergent and novel marine ar-
chaeal group. EF2 sequences are found in all cellular organ-
isms, are highly conserved, and have proven particularly useful
for constructing global phylogenies (5, 6, 19). Analyses of the
EF2-encoding sequence on fosmid 4B7 (Fig. 7) allowed an
independent assessment of the phylogenetic placement of the
planktonic Crenarchaeota. Both distance and parsimony anal-
yses of the EF2 amino acid sequence indicated its specific
affiliation with EF2 sequences of the Crenarchaeota (Fig. 7).
The congruence between the rRNA gene and EF2 protein
phylogenies strongly supports the close relationship of this
planktonic marine archaeal group with the hyperthermophilic
Crenarchaeota.
Neither RNA helicase nor GSAT has been previously found
in archaea. RNA helicase belongs to the DEAD-box proteins
that catalyze the ATP-dependent alteration of RNA secondary
structure. This family of proteins has been implicated in splic-
ing, translation, cell growth, and development in eubacteria
FIG. 6. Phylogenetic analysis of the fosmid-encoded ssu rRNA sequence. (A) DeSoete least squares distance analyses (9) were performed by using pairwise
evolutionary distances, calculated by using the correction of Olsen to account for empirical base frequencies (25). Analyses were performed with the programs GDE
2.2 and Treetool 1.0, obtained from the RDP (23). Reference sequences, obtained from the RDP (version 4.0), include rDNA sequences from cultivated archaea as
well as PCR-amplified rDNA fragments retrieved from mixed plankton assemblages (indicated as pcr-). The scale bar represents five nucleotide substitutions per 100
sequence positions. (B) Bootstrap maximum likelihood analysis (10) of the ssu rRNA gene contained on fosmid 4B7, performed by using fastDNAml 1.0 (25). Analyses
were performed by using empirical base frequencies on a total of 1,295 unambiguously alignable sequence positions. Numbers represent percentage of 250 bootstrap
replications (11) that support the branching pattern appearing to the right of the value. Thermotoga maritima was used as an outgroup in the analysis. The scale bar
corresponds to the expected number of changes per sequence position for those positions changing at the median rate.

and eukaryotes (26), and all members described to date share
a highly conserved type B motif, LDEADxxL. The archaeo-
plankton RNA helicase encoded on clone 4B7 contains this
DEAD-box motif as well as several other conserved regions
diagnostic of the family. It has recently been shown that an-
other member of this family, DbpA from E. coli, will hydrolyze
ATP in the presence of E. coli 23S rRNA but not in the
presence of eukaryotic rRNA (15). It will be of interest to
determine whether the archaeal RNA helicase can distinguish
rRNAs from archaea, bacteria, and eucarya as well. GSAT is
involved in the synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid via one of
two pathways: either a C4 pathway found in animals, yeasts,
and some bacteria or a C5 pathway found in higher plants (18).
The C5 pathway leads to the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, and it
is noteworthy that the archaeoplankton GSAT gene appears
strongly affiliated with homologs from photoautotrophs, in-
cluding higher plants (Table 1).
Our results have interesting general implications with regard
to the physiological diversity and ecological distribution of the
Crenarchaeota. In total, the available phylogenetic and ecolog-
ical data suggest that a hyperthermophilic ancestor of plank-
tonic Crenarchaeota, perhaps originating from a hydrothermal
vent habitat, adapted to growth at low seawater temperatures,
giving rise to the planktonic Crenarchaeota. However, another
alternative interpretation of the deep placement of planktonic
archaeal 16S rRNA and EF2 genes within the crenarchaeotal
branch is that the Crenarchaeota as a group have a nonther-
mophilic origin. This latter alternative seems more unlikely,
however, in light of several newly discovered hyperthermo-
philic archaeal rDNA sequences (3) specifically related to the
planktonic archaeal rDNAs, which root more deeply within the
Crenarchaeota than do the planktonic marine crenarchaeotes
(2a).
Analysis of large genomic fragments from as yet unculti-
vated microorganisms can provide information on their genetic
composition, organization, and physiological potential as well

as their phylogenetic affiliation. The accelerated accumulation
of prokaryotic genome sequence, structure, and organizational
data provides a large comparative database for interrelating
homologous genomic properties of as yet uncultivated micro-
organisms. Isolation, cultivation, and physiological character-
ization of prokaryotes by classical pure culture techniques ob-
viously has distinct advantages and should be aggressively
pursued. However, it may well be the case that some micro-
organisms will continue to elude even the best attempts to
grow them at unnaturally high cell densities in artificial me-
dia in the monocultural state that we refer to as pure culture.
As one alternative to the problem of cultivability, genomic
walking from a phylogenetic anchor such as 16S rRNA may
help provide a better understanding of the physiological and
genetic potential of autochthonous, uncultivated microorgan-
isms which can often represent major components of naturally
occurring prokaryotic assemblages (7, 8, 16). In addition, the
data derived from such genomic studies may suggest more
useful strategies for optimizing future attempts at cultivation
and physiological characterization of uncultivated microbes,
using more traditional microbiological approaches.
