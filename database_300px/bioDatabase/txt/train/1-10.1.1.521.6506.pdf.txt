INTRODUCTION
Most cases of pulpal inflammation arise from caries lesions, which areareas of localized, progressive decay in the teeth (Seltzer and Bender,
1984). For inflamed pulp to recover from such a crisis, it is essential not
only that infection be removed but also that inflammation be controlled. In
general, chemical mediators from the many kinds of inflammatory cells that
infiltrate the pulp should control the progress of pulpal inflammation, and
over-production or imbalanced production of these chemical mediators may
easily induce pulpal tissue necrosis, since the pulp is encased in mineralized
tissue and is in a low-compliance environment. However, little is known
about the mediators that play the central roles in the regulation of pulpal
inflammation.
Nitric oxide (NO) was first reported to induce dilation of the blood
vessels (Palmer et al., 1987), but it is now known to be a biological effector
molecule in various systems, and is essential for these systems to function in
the body (Moilanen et al., 1999). NO is synthesized by a group of enzymes
called nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Three isoforms of this enzyme have
been characterized: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and
inducible NOS (iNOS). nNOS and eNOS are produced constitutively, while
iNOS is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS and
cytokines. Once iNOS is induced, it can produce copious quantities of NO
for prolonged periods (Moilanen et al., 1999), which further affects the
synthesis of the chemical mediators: IL1 (Hill et al., 1996), IL6 (Mossalayi
et al., 1994), IL12 (Rothe et al., 1996), TNF (Mossalayi et al., 1994), and
PGs (Posadas et al., 2000).
These properties of NO would make it an essential and important
mediator in pulpal pathosis, if it were produced at the onset of pulpal
inflammation. In this study, we evaluated whether iNOS expression was
related to the progress of pulpitis, and whether an NOS inhibitor would
effectively reduce pulpal inflammation.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Induction of Pulpitis
Six-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 63) were obtained from Clea Japan
(Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in a conventional environment in the Tokyo
Medical and Dental University Animal Facility according to institutional
guidelines. Pulpal exposure of upper incisors was performed while the rats were
under anesthesia, and 1 L of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from E. coli 0111:B4;
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (10 mg/mL, dissolved in sterile saline) was
applied to the pulp with sterile paper points. Sterile saline served as a negative
control. LPS-treated rats (n = 36) were killed at 0 (non-treated), 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24
hrs, and saline-applied rats (n = 18) were killed at 3, 6, and 9 hrs after LPS or
saline application. Half of the animals (n = 3 in each group) were used for reverse-
transcription/polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR), and the rest (n = 3 in each
ABSTRACT
Various kinds of chemical mediators are
synthesized in the course of pulpitis; thus, control
of their production would assist in inducing a
reduction in pulpal inflammation. We
hypothesized that nitric oxide (NO) would be an
important mediator of pulpal inflammation. Pulpal
inflammation was induced by the application of
LPS in rat incisor pulp, and inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) expression was evaluated by
reverse-transcription/polymerase chain-reaction
and immunohistochemical staining. After LPS
application, iNOS mRNA was first detected after
3 hrs, peaked at 6 hrs, and decreased thereafter.
iNOS-positive cells were macrophages and
neutrophils. An NOS inhibitor caused drastic
decreases in the expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and COX2 mRNA, which was highly
induced in the LPS-induced pulpitis. These results
indicate that NO synthesis is related to the
initiation of mediator production, and that its
down-regulation should contribute to the
prevention of pro-inflammatory mediator
synthesis. Abbreviations: ANOVA, analysis of

group) were used for immunohistochemistry and HE staining. To
induce inflammation in the liver, we injected LPS solution (0.1
mg/kg i.p.), and rats (n = 3) were killed at 6 hrs. The non-specific
NOS inhibitor, NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; Sigma),
was injected at 100 mg/kg (Sakinis and Wennmalm, 1998) at 15 min
before the application of LPS. L-NAME-injected and saline
(control)-injected rats (n = 3 each) were killed at 6 hrs after the LPS
application, and pulpal tissues were isolated for RT-PCR.
RT-PCR
The pulp tissues extracted from the left and right incisors of a rat
were combined, and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized from 2
g of total RNA by MMLV RNaseH- reverse-transcriptase
(Superscript II; Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed
with Taq polymerase (platinum PCR supermix; Invitrogen) and

software (http://www.scioncorp.com) and standardized against the
amount of -actin. The band density in each group (n = 3) was
evaluated statistically with one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer
tests. The amount of iNOS expression in the inflamed pulp was
quantitatively compared with that in LPS-treated liver, by means of
a competitive-PCR test (Takara, Kyoto, Japan).
Immunohistochemistry
Incisors were fixed with a periodate-lysine paraformaldehyde
fixative at 4°C overnight, and then decalcified in 14% EDTA at 4°C
for 3 wks. The frozen samples were serially sectioned at a thickness
of 7 m, with the use of a cryostat (Leica Microsystems AG,
Wetzlar, Germany). Immunohistochemical staining (avidin-biotin
peroxidase complex system, Elite ABC; Vector, Burlingame, CA,
USA) was performed with an anti-rat iNOS antibody (polyclonal,
x1250; Upstate Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), W3/13 (monoclonal,
anti-rat CD43, x 2500; Serotec, Oxford, UK), ED1 (monoclonal,
anti-rat CD68, x10,000; Serotec), and OX6 (monoclonal, anti-rat
MHC class II, x10,000; Serotec). Diaminobenzidine-HCl (DAB;
Vector) was used for visualization. Double-staining was performed
with anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (x200; Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa
Fluor 488 (x200, Molecular Probes). Double-stained samples were
evaluated under a confocal laser microscope (LSM5 Pascal; Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). On 3 typical sections from each
sample, we counted positively stained cells in whole pulp tissues,
except for the inside of abscesses and blood vessels, under 400x
magnification, using a 10mm x 10mm graticule, which was moved
to cover the pulp tissues completely. Cell fragments without nuclei
were excluded from the cell count. We calculated cell density by
dividing the total cell number by the pulpal area (mm2), which we
measured using bioimaging software (WinROOF, Mitani Co.,
Fukui, Japan). We confirmed the reliability of this method by
preliminary experiments in which cell counts on the same sections

mRNA expression in experimentally induced rat pulpitis. LPS application
to the pulp tissue of rat upper incisors for 6 hrs (A,B) caused severe
inflammation, and the infiltration of many neutrophils into the pulp tissue
can be seen (n = 3). Saline application (C,D) did not induce severe
inflammation. Bars in the low-power fields (A,C) and those in the high-
power fields (B,D) indicate 500 m and 80 m, respectively. iNOS
mRNA expression (n = 3 in each group) was evaluated with RT-PCR, and
the relative intensity of expression against -actin in each experimental
period was statistically compared, by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests (p
< 0.05), with that in untreated pulp samples. The relative intensities in
each period were: 0 ± 0, 0 hr; 0.4 ± 0.21, 3 hrs; 1.0 ± 0.24, 6 hrs; 0.6
± 0.15, 9 hrs; 0.075 ± 0.03, 12 hrs; and 0 ± 0, 24 hrs (mean ± SD) (E).
Competitive RT-PCR on LPS-treated pulp (6 hrs, n = 3) and LPS-treated
liver (6 hrs, n = 3) shows that the expression of iNOS mRNA in the LPS-
treated pulp is almost the same as that in the LPS-treated liver (F). The
same results were observed in 3 separate experiments.

RESULTS
Histological Findings for
Experimentally Induced 
Rat Pulpitis
Application of LPS to pulp
induced a strong inflammatory
reaction in the coronal area at 6
hrs (Figs. 1A, 1B). The patho-
logical findings were character-
ized by infiltration of many
neutrophils and the dilation of
blood vessels beneath the LPS-
treated portion. In contrast, saline
did not induce a severe inflam-
matory reaction, and only slight
infiltration of neutrophils was
observed in the coronal pulp at 6
hrs (Figs. 1C, 1D).
iNOS Expression in the
Inflamed Pulp
iNOS mRNA expression was not
observed in either the saline-
treated pulp (data not shown) or
the non-treated pulp tissue (0 hr,
Fig. 1E). However, application of
LPS to the pulp induced iNOS
mRNA expression even at 3 hrs,
and peak expression was noted at
6 hrs (Fig. 1E). The iNOS
expression decreased thereafter,
and only slight expression was
observed at 12 hrs. No expression
was observed at 24 hrs.
Competitive PCR showed that the
iNOS mRNA expression level in
the LPS-treated pulp at 6 hrs was
between 104 and 105 copies
compared with that of the iNOS
competitor, and that, in the LPS-
treated liver at 6 hrs, it was about
105 copies of the iNOS competitor
(Fig. 1F).
Evaluation of iNOS+ Cells
No iNOS+ cells were observed in
either the saline-treated (3, 6, 9
hrs; Fig. 2A) or the non-treated (0
hr) pulp tissue. The cells started to
infiltrate the pulp tissue 3 hrs after
the application of LPS, and were
observed around blood vessels
beneath the exposed surface. Six
hrs after the application of LPS,
iNOS+ cells were scattered
abundantly over the coronal pulp
(Fig. 2A). ED1+ and Ia+ cells were
observed in the coronal portion of LPS-treated pulp (Fig. 2A),
but there were fewer Ia+ cells than ED1+ cells. Double-staining
with iNOS and ED1 or OX6 revealed that iNOS+ cells were
divided into ED1+ and ED1- cells, and that the population of
Figure 2. iNOS+ cells in the inflamed pulp. (A) LPS application for 6 hrs (n = 3) caused infiltration of
many iNOS+ cells with heterogeneous morphology into the inflamed coronal pulp. Many ED1+
macrophages and OX6+ antigen-presenting cells were also present. Saline application instead of LPS (n =
3) did not cause iNOS+ cell infiltration. ED1+ cells and OX6+ cells were observed in the saline-applied
pulps, but their number was quite small compared with those in the LPS-applied pulps. Bars in the low-
and high-power fields indicate 200 m and 50 m, respectively. The upper portions of these images are
close to the exposed surface. (B) Double-staining with ED1 and anti-iNOS antibodies reveals that most of
the iNOS+ cells were also ED1+ (closed arrowheads, ED1+ macrophages; open arrowheads, iNOS+ cells;
open arrows, ED1 and iNOS double-positive cells). In contrast, the population of OX6+ cells (closed
arrowheads) was completely different from the population of iNOS+ cells (open arrowheads).

iNOS+ cells was completely
different from that of OX6+ cells
(Fig. 2B).
Semi-quantitative Analysis
The density of positively stained
cells is indicated in the Table.
Infiltration of iNOS+ cells into
pulp was observed at 3 hrs and
peaked at 9 hrs. At 3 hrs, many of
the iNOS+ cells were granulo-
cytes, but the population of ED1+
macrophages increased thereafter,
and most of the iNOS+ cells at 9
hrs were ED1+ macrophages. The
peaks of infiltration of W3/13+,
ED1+, and OX6+ cells were
observed at 3, 9, and 9 hrs,
respectively. 
Cytokine and COX2 Expression
in the Inflamed Pulp
Slight expression of IL1, IL1,
and COX2 was observed, but
other cytokines were not
expressed in either the saline-
treated pulp (data not shown) or
the non-treated pulp tissue (0 hr,
Fig. 3A). LPS application rapidly
induced the expression of IL6 and
TNF and also enhanced the
expression of IL1, IL1, and
COX2 at 3 hrs after the pulpal
exposure. The expression of all
the pro-inflammatory cytokines
(IL1, IL1, IL6, and TNF) and
COX2 peaked at 6 hrs, but a high
expression level of IL1
continued until 24 hrs. IL12
expression was observed only at 6
hrs (Fig. 3B). The expression of
IL10 mRNA, an anti-inflam-
matory cytokine, was first
observed at 6 hrs after the LPS
application, and its expression
level decreased thereafter.
Effects of an iNOS Inhibitor
on Cytokine and COX2
Expression
Administration of the non-
specific NOS inhibitor L-NAME
induced a drastic decrease in the
expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines (IL1, IL1, and
TNF) and COX2 at 6 hrs after
the LPS application (Fig. 3B). In
particular, expressions of IL1,
IL1, and TNF were severely
depressed in L-NAME-treated rat
pulp, and COX2 expression in L-
NAME-treated rats was about
Figure 3. Cytokine and COX2 mRNA expression in inflamed pulp and the effects of L-NAME on their

band was measured with Scion Image software. The peak expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1,
IL1, and TNF) and COX2 occurred at 6 hrs after the application of LPS (n = 3). The expression of IL10,
which is one of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, was first observed at 6 hrs. The relative intensities of chemical
mediators in each period were: (IL1a) 0.2 ± 0.11, 0 hr; 0.41 ± 0.17, 3 hrs; 0.83 ± 0.3, 6 hrs; 0.23 ± 0.15, 9
hrs; 0.17 ± 0.14, 12 hrs; 0.15 ± 0.1, 24 hrs; (IL1b) 0.2 ± 0.02, 0 hr; 0.81 ± 0.03, 3 hrs; 1.84 ± 0.38, 6 hrs;
1.22 ± 0.38, 9 hrs; 0.85 ± 0.13, 12 hrs; 0.88 ± 0.12, 24 hrs; (IL6) 0 ± 0, 0 hr; 1.21 ± 0.29, 3 hrs; 1.37 ±
0.43, 6 hrs; 1.02 ± 0.18, 9 hrs; 0.73 ± 0.17, 12 hrs; 0.27 ± 0.18, 24 hrs; (IL10) 0 ± 0, 0 hr; 0 ± 0, 3 hrs;
0.43 ± 0.11, 6 hrs; 0.27 ± 0.03, 9 hrs; 0.09 ± 0.01, 12 hrs; 0.08 ± 0.01, 24 hrs; (TNF) 0 ± 0, 0 hr; 0.2 ±
0.15, 3 hrs; 1.03 ± 0.41, 6 hrs; 0.6 ± 0.24, 9 hrs; 0.04 ± 0.01, 12 hrs; 0 ± 0, 24 hrs; and (COX2) 0.02 ±
0.01, 0 hr; 0.62 ± 0.07, 3 hrs; 0.75 ± 0.1, 6 hrs; 0.66 ± 0.09, 9 hrs; 0.01 ± 0.01, 12 hrs; and 0.01 ± 0.01,
24 hrs (mean ± SD). The relative intensities of each period were statistically compared, by ANOVA and
Tukey-Kramer tests (p < 0.05), with those in untreated pulp samples. (B) Cytokine and COX2 mRNA
expression in inflamed pulp (6 hrs after LPS application) treated with or without L-NAME (n = 3, respectively)
was evaluated by RT-PCR, and the density of each band was measured with Scion Image software. Each pro-
inflammatory cytokine/COX2 mRNA expression was inhibited by the application of L-NAME. In contrast, IL6
and IL10 mRNA expression was not influenced by the application of L-NAME. The relative intensities of
chemical mediators at 6 hrs after LPS application in the absence and presence of L-NAME were: (IL1) 0.85 ±
0.13 and 0.26 ± 0.19; (IL1b) 1.7 ± 0.2 and 0.26 ± 0.17; (IL6) 1.2 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.29; (IL10) 0.42 ± 0.12
and 0.4 ± 0.14; (IL12) 0.2 ± 0.14 and 0 ± 0; (TNF) 0.81 ± 0.23 and 0.26 ± 0.13; and (COX2) 0.9 ± 0.09
and 0.49 ± 0.21 (mean ± SD). The relative intensities of each mediator in the presence of L-NAME were
statistically compared, by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests (p < 0.05), with those in the absence of L-NAME.

60% of that in saline-treated ones. In contrast, expression of
IL6 and IL10 was not affected by L-NAME administration.
DISCUSSION
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase activity,
which is related to the total activity of NOS in rat pulp, and
immunoreactivity against iNOS in rat and human pulpal
inflammation have been reported (Kerezoudis et al., 1993; Law et
al., 1999; Di Nardo Di Maio et al., 2004), but the types of cells
synthesizing iNOS in pulpitis have been unclear. We reveal here
that most iNOS production in inflamed pulp was due to neutrophils
and Ia- macrophages, and that the kinetics of iNOS expression
related to inflammatory cell infiltration into the pulp. Most of the
iNOS+ cells in pulp tissue at 3 hrs after LPS application were
neutrophils, which were observed around blood vessels, and would
be responsible for the NO production at the beginning of pulpal
inflammation. At 6 hrs, many iNOS+ cells were ED1+ macrophages
that were abundantly distributed in the pulp tissue. Furthermore,
double-staining revealed that most iNOS+ macrophages did not
express the Ia antigen. Ia- macrophages are reported to be the major
source of NO in the early phase of inflammation in experimental
uveo-retinitis (Zhang et al., 1999). As a result, neutrophils and Ia-
macrophages were responsible for the production of NO in the
early phase of pulpal inflammation.
To characterize pulpal inflammation, we evaluated the
kinetics of cytokine and COX2 expression. The expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL1, IL1, and TNF,
began or increased at 3 hrs after the application of LPS,
corresponding to the onset of pulpitis. These pro-inflammatory
cytokines are largely produced by inflammatory cells such as
macrophages (Tani-Ishii et al., 1995), but the pulpal cells might
produce chemical mediators in response to LPS (Hosoya and
Matsushima, 1997), even though the amounts would be limited.
IL12 expression was detected in rat pulpitis (Fig. 3B), but its
expression was temporal and was observed only at 6 hrs;
however, it has been reported to be a key cytokine in the course
of inflammation (Trifilieff et al., 2000). Expressions of anti-
inflammatory cytokines, such as IL10, were first observed at 6
hrs after the application of LPS. Production of anti-inflammatory
cytokines should be induced as a result of the over-production of
inflammatory cytokines, to control them (Kawashima and
Stashenko, 1999). COX2 mRNA expression in pulp tissue was
clearly observed from 3
to 9 hrs after
application of LPS in
this study, and the
prostaglandin metabo-
lites produced by
COX2 might be in-
volved in pulpal
inflammatory reactions
(Okiji et al., 1987,
1989).
To determine the
effects of NOS
inhibitors on cytokine
and COX2 expression
in pulp tissue, we
applied L-NAME
before applying LPS to
the pulp. L-NAME, an
arginine analogue, is widely used as a non-selective inhibitor of
NOS enzymes (Moncada and Higgs, 1995). Our study revealed
that L-NAME dramatically inhibited inflammatory cytokine
and COX2 expression. Down-regulation of cytokine expression
by L-NAME was also observed in arthritis and LPS-treated
liver (Aono et al., 1997; de Mello et al., 1997). Considering the
properties of NO that could induce chemical mediators
(Mossalayi et al., 1994; Hill et al., 1996; Rothe et al., 1996;
Posadas et al., 2000), the blockade of NO synthesis by an NOS
inhibitor could be responsible for the down-regulation of
cytokine and COX expression. However, we recently found
that a selective iNOS inhibitor was effective for inhibiting the
infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils,
macrophages, and Ia+ cells, into pulp (Kawanishi et al., 2004).
Selective iNOS inhibitors have been reported to down-regulate
chemokine expression during airway inflammation (Trifilieff et
al., 2000), and limitations on chemokine production by NOS
inhibitors could diminish the infiltration of inflammatory cells.
The down-regulation of cytokine and COX2 synthesis in the
pulp observed in this study may have been caused by this
diminution of inflammatory cell infiltration into the pulp. The
beneficial effects of NOS inhibitors on inflammation have been
reported for other tissues (Colon et al., 2000; Trifilieff et al.,
2000; Kankuri et al., 2001), although opposite effects have also
been reported (Vos et al., 1997). Further study will be
necessary to evaluate the effects of the mechanisms of NOS
inhibitors on the progress of inflammation.
In conclusion, NO synthesis may be related to the initiation
of mediator production, since NOS inhibitors down-regulated
the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins.
NO would also cause severe relaxation of the blood vessel
smooth muscle and enhancement of permeability in inflamed
pulp. These phenomena might be harmful to 'low-compliant'
pulp tissue (Kim and Dörscher-Kim, 1990). Therefore, over-
production of NO would be harmful to pulp tissue, and so
administration of an NOS- or iNOS-specific inhibitor may have
a beneficial action on pulpal inflammation.
