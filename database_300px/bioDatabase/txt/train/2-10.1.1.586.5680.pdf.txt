Abstract: Following an official recommendation in the Faroe Islands that women should abstain 
from eating mercury-contaminated pilot whale meat, a survey was carried out to obtain 
information on dietary habits and hair samples for mercury analysis. A letter was sent to all 1180 
women aged 26-30 years who resided within the Faroes, and the women were contacted again 
one year later. A total of 415 women responded to the first letter; the second letter resulted in 
145 repeat hair samples and 125 new responses. Questionnaire results showed that Faroese 
women, on average, consumed whale meat for dinner only once every second month, but the 
frequency and meal size depended on the availability of whale in the community. The geometric 
mean hair-mercury concentration at the first survey was higher in districts with available whale 
than in those without (3.03 µg/g vs. 1.88 µg/g; p = 0.001). The mercury concentration also 
depended on the frequency of whale meat dinners and on consumption of dried whale meat. The 
36 women who did not eat whale meat at all had a geometric mean hair-mercury concentration of 
1.28 µg/g. At the time of the second survey, the geometric mean had decreased to 1.77 µg/g (p < 
0.001), although whale was now available in all districts. In comparison with previously 
published data on hair-mercury concentrations in pregnant Faroese women, these results 
document substantially lower exposures as well as a further decrease temporally associated with 
the issue of a stricter dietary advisory.

INTRODUCTION 
Dietary recommendations are usually issued without any subsequent assessment of their impact. 
Therefore, little information is available on factors that affect compliance. In regard to some food 
contaminants, exposure markers constitute an objective and powerful instrument to assess 
individual intake levels (Grandjean et al., 1994). For example, exposure biomarker data have 
been critical for public policy decisions on abatement of contamination with lead (Annest et al., 
1983) and methylmercury (Schober et al., 2003). In addition, knowledge of one’s own exposure 
to a dietary contaminant could be an important incentive to changing food habits. Methylmercury 
exposure is almost always exclusively dietary and originates from certain types of freshwater 
fish and seafood (UNEP, 2002). For assessment of dietary intakes of this food contaminant, hair-
mercury analysis has been found to be highly suitable, though somewhat imprecise (Grandjean et 
al., 2002). Hair sampling does not require any expertise, the sample can be sent by regular mail, 
it may be stored at room temperature, and the relatively high mercury concentration allows a 
simple and rapid analysis by well-documented technology (Cerniciari et al., 1995; Grandjean, 
1994).  
 In the Faroe Islands, the main single source of increased methylmercury exposure is 
whale meat (Andersen et al., 1989). Within this small fishing community in the North Atlantic, a 
new dietary recommendation was dispersed through news media and thereby reached all 
residents. To examine the impact of this advisory and to assess whether knowledge of one’s own 
exposure might lead to changes in dietary habits, we contacted twice by mail an age-stratified 
group of the female population. Table 1 shows the time schedule of the main events of the study.

Whaling in the Faroes 
The North Atlantic pilot whale (Globicephala melas) has been hunted in several communities in the 
North Atlantic and is still harvested in the Faroes (Johansen et al., 1999). The Faroese pilot whale 
catch is a traditional, communal, environmentally sustainable, and non-commercial hunt. The 
authorities distribute the meat and blubber according to traditional rules, the main rule being equal 
shares for all inhabitants of the district. 
 The pilot whale catch proceeds as follows: a school of pilot whales, being observed near the 
coast, is driven into a fiord and beached, preferably on a gently sloping seashore. The whales are 
then killed by stabbing the neck with a special knife that severs the carotid arteries. Acknowledging 
the animal welfare issues, the Faroese authorities have updated the age-old rules laid down for the 
pilot whale hunt by banning the harpoon and the whale spear and by regulating the use of hooks 
from boats (Bloch et al., 1990). 
 The pilot whale is a small whale that occurs in large schools in the North Atlantic and the 
Mediterranean, and (as a closely related species) in the Pacific Ocean. As a small cetacean, this 
whale is not covered by regulations decided by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). 
Working jointly with the IWC, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the North 
Atlantic Marine Mammal Co-operation Organisation, and other authorities, Faroese and 
international scientists keep a close watch on the size of the whale population. The most recent 
estimate is that there are approximately 780,000 animals in the North East Atlantic (Bloch et al., 
1990). 
 Since 1584, Faroese civil servants have secured detailed reports on the pilot whale harvest, 
including the date of the catch, the location, the number of whales, the amount of meat and blubber 
of each whale, and the distribution of the catch to members of the local communities. The amount 
6 
of meat and blubber is measured in skinn units, each consisting of 38 kg meat and 34 kg blubber. 
The statistics are incomplete before 1709, but subsequent reports show that the annual catch 
fluctuates around a long-term average catch of approximately 1,000 animals, or 6,000 skinn (Bloch 
et al., 1990). The Faroese authorities consider this harvest of pilot whales in the waters around the 
Faroe Islands as both sustainable and legitimate. Should the scientists so recommend, the authorities 
will be prepared to limit the catches (Bloch et al., 1990). So far, catches have been limited only in 
order to avoid waste when the need for whale meat and blubber is considered to be met in a 
particular district.  
 The distribution of the catch is administrated by the local head of police (Bloch et al., 1990). 
The meat and blubber are salted, frozen or cut in strips for drying. By these preservation procedures, 
the catch can be kept for many months, thereby ensuring a steady supply over time. Normally, 
storage time is expected to last up to one year, since pilot whale catches are seasonal and mostly 
occur in the late summer months. While fresh meat and blubber may be cooked hours or days after 
the catch, feasting ceremonies with unusual big consumption do not occur.  
 
Dietary advisories 
Since 1980, pregnant women have been advised to limit their consumption of pilot whale meat 
and blubber to avoid methylmercury exposure. A large study of women who gave birth at the 
Faroese hospitals in 1986-1987 showed that about 15% had hair-mercury concentrations above 
10 µg/g (Grandjean et al., 1992), a level then considered the upper limit of safe exposure (IPCS, 
1990). A subsequent recommendation in 1989 extended the advice to indicate that adults should 
not eat more than 150–200 grams of pilot whale meat (and 100-200 grams of blubber) per 
month. With a mercury concentration of about 2.1µg/g whale meat, this intake would correspond 
7 
to an average daily dose of 0.2 µg/kg body weight for a 60-kg woman. 
 The children born in 1986-1987 were examined by sophisticated neuropsychological and 
neurophysiological methods at age 7 years, and the results showed significant exposure-
associated decrements in several brain functions (Grandjean et al., 1997; Weihe et al., 1998). 
These results were presented and discussed at an international conference in 1998. In August 
1998, the following diet recommendations were issued by the Faroese authorities, based on the 
demonstrated effects of mercury exposure and on a general assessment of PCB's: “The mercury 
content of pilot whale meat is high and is one of our main mercury sources. Therefore, we 
recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month. Women who plan to become 
pregnant within three months, pregnant women, and nursing women should abstain from eating 
pilot whale meat. High PCB contents in blubber lead us to recommend that adults, at the 
maximum, eat pilot whale blubber once to twice a month. However, the best way to protect 
fetuses against the potential harmful effects of PCBs is if girls and women do not eat blubber 
until they have given birth to their children. Pilot whale liver and kidneys should not be eaten at 
all”. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Mailing addresses were obtained from the Faroese Public Registry for all women aged 26-30 
years and residing in the Faroe Islands at the beginning of 1999. This 5-year age interval was 
chosen because of the peak prevalence of pregnancy at these ages at about 15%. A letter of 
invitation in Faroese was sent to 1180 women from the Chief Physician of the Department of 
Occupational Medicine and Public Health of the Faroese Hospital System (PW). He informed 
them that mercury concentrations in pilot whale meat were high and repeated the most recent 
8 
dietary advisory. A free hair analysis for mercury was offered and detailed instructions were 
given in Faroese on hair sampling: “cut the hair sample from the back of your head so that the 
total hair sample corresponds to the thickness of a match. The strands should be cut close to the 
scalp and be at least 6 cm long. To identify the direction that the hair had been growing, a cotton 
string provided in the enclosed envelope should be tied around the proximal end of the hair 
sample.” 
 The letter also indicated that a safe exposure to mercury would correspond to a mercury 
concentration in hair that was below 5 :g/g, and that this exposure was of particular concern for 
women who were considering or planning to become pregnant in the future. A questionnaire in 
Faroese on dietary habits was also enclosed in the letter; an English translation is shown in Table 
2. A stamped envelope was included in order to facilitate the return of the questionnaire and the 
hair sample. 
 All letters were mailed in February, 1999. A total of 415 women answered the 
questionnaire and 412 of those supplied a hair sample, 24 of which were not appropriate for 
analysis. The three women who had filled in the questionnaire but not supplied a hair sample 
were contacted again, but none responded.  
In March, 2000, a second invitation to send in hair samples was sent to all of the 415 
women who had initially responded; 159 (38.3%) repeat responses were received. At the same 
time, the 765 non-responders received a separate letter of invitation; a total of 125 (16.3%) new 
subjects now answered the questionnaire and 122 of them provided a hair sample. The total 
response rate was 24.1% (N = 284). Undoubtedly, the response rate was negatively affected by a 
concomitant discussion in the media on privacy of health data, provoked by the formation of a 
9 
population genetics data base in Iceland.  
 The proximal 2 cm of each hair sample from both the first and the second survey were 
analyzed for mercury as an indicator of methylmercury exposure during the recent months 
(Grandjean et al., 2002). Assuming a hair growth rate of 1 cm per month, a distal segment 6-8 
cm measured from the proximal end of the first sample would correspond to the time before the 
official advisory; a total of 320 samples were of sufficient length for this purpose. Only 63 of the 
first hair samples allowed analysis of hair at 11-13 cm that would have formed about a year 
before. 
 The intent was to report the first results to all women within a few months, but problems 
with the analytical instrument delayed the initiation of the assays so that the average reporting 
time was six months. Results reported before October of 1999 were accepted as timely in regard 
to changes in dietary habits that could be assessed in the second samples.   
 The hair samples were analyzed in segments as described above. Mercury analysis was 
performed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Grandjean et al., 2002). For mineralization of the 
sample, we used microwave digestion in PTFE-lined vessels and mercury analysis by flow-
injection cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. The total analytical imprecision was 
estimated to be 2.3 and 3.2% at mercury concentrations 4.7 and 11.4 :g/g respectively. The 
accuracy of the mercury determination in human hair was ensured by using the certified 
reference material CRM 397 (BCR, Brussels, Belgium) as quality control material; the mercury 
concentration averaged 11.36 :g/g compared to the assigned value of 11.93±0.77 :g/g. 
Participation in external quality assessment schemes also rendered highly satisfactory results. 
 To ascertain individual exposure potentials, the official statistics on pilot whale catches 
10 
were consulted. The catches in both 1998 and 1999 were similar to the historical average (6002 
skinns and 5398 skinns, respectively), but the locations of the catches differed. From the 
residence of each responder, and the date and size of the most recent local whale catch, it was 
determined whether whale meat had been available during the period of time reflected by each 
hair segment analyzed. The following assumptions were made: 1) The amount of whale meat 
allocated to a community by the authorities after a whale catch is evenly distributed to all 
residents of the community and 2) The individual consumption of whale meat (when available) 
averages 12 g per day, as documented in the most recent dietary survey (Vestergaard and 
Zachariassen,1987).  Seven women had recently moved and their exposure potential could 
therefore not be classified. 
 Because of skewed distributions, hair-mercury results were logarithmically transformed 
to calculate geometric means. Parametric tests included paired and unpaired t tests. 
Questionnaire answers were grouped, where appropriate, to obtain groups that were no smaller 
than 5%. A regression analysis was carried out by using as independent variables the 
questionnaire answers that were significant (p < 0.05) predictors in bivariate analyses.  
 
RESULTS 
A questionnaire answers from the 415 women from the first survey and 125 from the second 
survey differed little and were therefore combined (Table 2). A total of 126 (24.3%) women did 
not eat pilot whale at all, but some ate pilot whale as often as nine times per month (twice a 
week). The median frequency was once every two months. The average portion size was 
between 100 g and 200g. Again, assuming a methylmercury concentration of 2.1 :g/g (Andersen 
11 
et al., 1987) and a body weight of 60 kg, a whale meat stake of 150 g once every two months 
corresponds to an average daily intake of methylmercury at slightly below 0.1 :g/kg body 
weight. This intake level would result in a hair-mercury concentration of approximately 1 :g/g 
(UNEP, 2002). Dried pilot whale meat probably also contributed to the total intake, although the 
majority of the women ate this food item only rarely. However, the questionnaire did not aim at 
providing quantifiable data in regards to other mercury-containing food sources, such as seabirds 
and fish, which were also likely to contribute to the exposure. Most questionnaire results were 
similar in districts with and without local availability of whale, but the frequencies of whale 
dinners and the sizes of portions were lower when whale meat was not considered to be locally 
available.  
 The geometric mean mercury concentration in the 388 hair samples from the first survey 
was 2.53 :g/g. The 238 women who had resided in districts where whale meat was available 
showed a higher mean of 3.03 :g/g [i.e., about 60% greater than the geometric mean of 1.88 
:g/g seen in the 144 women from districts without local access to whale meat (p = 0.001)]. Also, 
hair-mercury concentrations were greater in the smaller fishing villages, as compared to the three 
major towns, but this tendency was probably due to the relative lack of local access to whale in 
the towns. Higher mercury levels were also seen in women who had not decreased their intake of 
whale (Table 4). The mercury level was associated with the frequency of whale meat dinners, the 
size of whale meat portions, and with habitual intake of dried whale meat. At the same time, 
inclusion of seabirds in the diet was associated with an increase, while inclusion of meat from 
terrestrial animals was associated with a decrease in hair-mercury concentrations. 
For the 36 women who neither ate whale meat for dinner nor dried whale meat, the 
12 
average hair-mercury concentration was only 1.28 :g/g. Slightly increased concentrations were 
seen in women, who planned the dinner meals well in advance. A similar increase was seen in 
women who cared about the meals being nutritious, in accordance with the widespread belief 
that eating whale is healthy. Yet, only in regards to women without local access to whale meat 
did the desire for more information about diet and health show a tendency of increased mercury 
exposure. A regression analysis was carried out with the hair-mercury concentration as the 
dependent variable and with all predictors as independent variables that had been found 
statistically significant (p < 0.05) in the bivariate analyses. This analysis showed that the main 
determinants of the hair mercury level were survey number, availability of whale meat and 
frequency of whale meat dinners, while all other predictors were non-significant. These findings 
are in accordance with the expectation, but the low participation rate precluded more detailed 
analysis of the data.  
 The geometric mean of the 6-8 cm sample from the first survey was 2.63 :g/g, which is 
marginally (p = 0.05) higher than the 2.46 :g/g seen in the same women’s proximal segment 
about 6 months later. Thus, these women had barely reduced their exposures during the first few 
months following the new advisory. The hair-mercury profile from 46 women, from whom three 
segmental analyses were available, also did not show any significant temporal pattern.  
 At the time of the second survey, whale meat was considered available in all districts 
involved, but the geometric mean had nonetheless decreased to 1.77 :g/g. This temporal 
lowering of hair-mercury concentrations was seen both in the total material and in the restricted 
group of women, who had local access to whale on both occasions (p < 0.001). For the 145 
women, who had a hair analysis on both occasions, the geometric means were 2.49 :g/g and 
13 
1.83 :g/g, respectively (p < 0.001). If based only on the 88 of the women residing in districts 
with easy access to whale meat at both occasions, the decrease from the first to the second survey 
was also clear (p < 0.001). Despite the decreases observed, the results from women who 
participated in both surveys correlated well (r = 0.59). The averages for the women examined 
twice were similar to those of the total groups.  
 Most of the women had received the result of the (first) hair analysis in time so that a 
change in dietary habits could be reflected in the mercury concentration of the second hair 
sample (N = 95). Whether they responded to the second invitation letter did not seem to be 
related to the time when they received the hair-analysis (P2 = 0.126; p = 0.72). However, the 
availability of an early report on their hair level on the first survey did not seem to affect the 
result of the second survey, perhaps because the delay in reporting the hair analyses left only 
limited time to detect any dietary change.  
 
DISCUSSION 
Published exposure levels from the Faroes are similar in magnitude to those occurring in Arctic 
areas and in other populations that rely heavily on seafood, including marine mammals (UNEP, 
2002). The present study of women in reproductive age groups, a life-stage group considered 
particularly at risk (UNEP, 2002), demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining hair samples by mail 
for mercury analysis. The hair-mercury concentrations showed clear associations with factors 
that would be expected to influence the exposure potential.  
 The statistically significant decrease from the first survey to the second coincides with 
the dietary recommendation from the Faroese health authorities that women in reproductive age 
groups should refrain from eating pilot whale meat. The public advisory was the result of serious 
14 
considerations that took into regard the essential nutrients in whale meat, and the historical and 
cultural importance of pilot whales and whaling.  
Still, this fortunate change in exposure levels may not necessarily be ascribed to a single 
advisory. The impact of previous dietary advisories and press coverage of mercury toxicity are 
probably reflected by the fact that, at the first survey, almost half of the women said that they had 
already decreased their whale consumption, and only 16% ate whale meat for dinner more 
frequently than the recommended rate of once per month. While hair-mercury concentrations 
appeared to be relatively constant during the last 6-12 months before the first survey, the 
reduction seen in the 125 women who participated in the survey one year later was unlikely to be 
due to chance. In addition, this substantial reduction occurred despite a wider availability of 
whale meat in the communities. 
 Due to the limited response rate, it is possible that the women are not representative of 
the total eligible female population. Nonetheless, the association with whale intake is similar to 
the one found in a cohort of consecutive births in 1986-1987 (Grandjean et al., 1992), and the 
overall survey results show lower averages, also in comparison to the more recent birth cohort 
data from 1994-1995 (Steuerwald et al., 2000). Women who responded may have had special 
reason for concern (e.g., because they frequently ate pilot whale meat, or because they were or 
planned to become pregnant). In addition, women who for some reason had already decreased 
their whale meat intake might be interested in having their low exposure confirmed. For privacy 
reasons, the results could not be linked to medical information on pregnancies and child births. 
Because pregnant women are probably more likely to abstain from eating whale meat, the fact 
that the present results are now lower than previous results from pregnant women, would support 
the conclusion that the decreases in exposure are real. 
15 
 Given the increased concerns about methylmercury toxicity (UNEP, 2002), the long-term 
aim of the most recent dietary advisory is to reduce hair-mercury concentrations in women in 
reproductive age groups to 1-2 :g/g and below. This mercury level appears to correspond to the 
baseline exposure that will, almost by necessity, occur due to prevalent, but low methylmercury 
concentrations in fish, shellfish, and seabirds. Therefore, the women who completely abstained 
from eating whale meat had hair-mercury concentrations in the desired range. In this regard, the 
current recommendation seems to be appropriate.  
 The use of exposure biomarkers for preventive purposes is not new in environmental 
health. Yet, most experience has centered on blood-lead assessment, where this exposure 
biomarker has been an important outcome variable in many intervention studies (Aschengrau et 
al., 1994; Hilts et al., 1998; Lanphear et al., 1999). In a wider sense, the use of personal clinical-
chemistry results is well established in clinical management of certain diseases, especially 
serum-glucose monitoring in diabetes patients (Cox et al., 1991; Larsen et al., 1990). Also, 
cholesterol screening has a long history in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, because a 
serum result deemed disadvantageous motivates the subject to pursue available means to remain 
healthy (Elton et al., 1994; Reynolds et al., 1997; Strychnar et al., 1997). The present study lends 
further support to the use of exposure biomarkers for individual prevention purposes. Still, 
because of the small numbers involved and the delay in reporting the hair-mercury results, we 
could not determine whether the hair-mercury result affected the women’s dietary habits. 
 In conclusion, the impact of a dietary recommendation issued by the Faroese authorities 
was examined by means of hair-mercury analyses. While only a small decrease was observed in 
the months prior to the advisory, a 60% decrease occurred during the year following this 
recommendation. Although the material is small and may not necessarily be representative, this 
16 
finding supports the usefulness of a public information campaign with a relatively simple 
message in regard to seafood contamination, and it supports the use of hair-mercury assessments 
for follow-up of the intervention. The decisions made by the Faroese public health authorities in 
regard to dietary recommendations therefore appear both appropriate and successful.
