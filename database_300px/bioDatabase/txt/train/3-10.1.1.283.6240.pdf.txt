ABSTRACT
Helicases play central roles in initiation and elonga-
tion of DNA replication. We previously reported that
helicase and ATPase activities of the mammalian
Mcm4/6/7 complex are activated specifically by
thymine-rich single-stranded DNA. Here, we exam-
ined its substrate preference and helicase actions
using various synthetic DNAs. On a bubble substrate,
Mcm4/6/7 makes symmetric dual contacts with the
50-proximal 25 nt single-stranded segments adjacent
to the branch points, presumably generating double
hexamers. Loss of thymine residues from one single-
strand results in significant decrease of unwinding
efficacy, suggesting that concurrent bidirectional
unwinding by a single double hexameric Mcm4/6/7
may play a role in efficient unwinding of the bubble.
Mcm4/6/7 binds and unwinds various fork and exten-
sion structures carrying a single-stranded 30-tail DNA.
The extent of helicase activation depends on the
sequence context of the 30-tail, and the maximum
level is achieved by DNA with 50% or more thymine
content. Strand displacement by Mcm4/6/7 is inhib-
ited, as the GC content of the duplex region incre-
ases. Replacement of cytosine–guanine pairs with
cytosine–inosine pairs in the duplex restored unwind-
ing, suggesting that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 helicase
has difficulties in unwinding stably base-paired
duplex. Taken together, these findings reveal import-
ant features on activation and substrate preference
of the eukaryotic replicative helicase.
INTRODUCTION
DNA helicases couple the hydrolysis of nucleotide or deoxy-
nucleotide triphosphate to duplex unwinding (1). Coordination
of a set of subactivities including nucleotide binding, DNA
binding and ATP hydrolysis is required for unwinding of
duplex DNA (1,2). The hexameric helicases, to which mini-
chromosome maintenance (Mcm) helicase belongs, are known
to assemble a ring-like structure (3–5). Whereas most of DNA
helicases of this group, including simian virus 40 large T-
antigen (6), Escherichia coli DnaB (7) and Archaeal Mcm
(4,8,9), are composed of a single subunit, the active eukaryotic
Mcm helicases are composed of two trimeric Mcm4/6/7
proteins (10–14).
All the six Mcm 2–7 proteins contain highly conserved
DNA-dependent ATPase motifs in their central regions
(15,16). Among the several stable subcomplexes which MCM
proteins can generate, only the Mcm4/6/7 complex has been
shown to possess an intrinsic DNA helicase activity (10–14,
17–18). While Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7 proteins make dis-
tinct contribution to its helicase activity (11–13), Mcm2
or Mcm3/5 inhibit the helicase activity of the Mcm4/6/7 com-
plex by converting its double trimer structure into a hetero-
tetramer or heteropentamer, respectively (3,11). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays and genetic characterization in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strongly suggested that Mcm is
involved not only in initiation but also in the DNA chain
elongation stage as a replicative helicase (19,20). Consistent
with this notion, the processivity of the Schizosaccharomyces
pombe and mouse Mcm4/6/7 complexes is significantly stimu-
lated on forked DNA structures and it can unwind duplex DNA
of 400–500 bp (13,14). Mcm4/6/7 binds to fork and bubble
structures in an ATP-dependent manner, and generates a
double-hexameric complex, as was shown for T-antigen
(13,14,21). Recently, we reported that the helicase and ATP
hydrolysis activities of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 are specifically
activated by single-stranded DNA containing stretches of
thymine residues and proposed a novel model that Mcm
may play a crucial role in selection of replication origins in
higher eukaryotes (13).
In this report, in order to clarify the mode of action of the
Mcm helicase and obtain insight into how it may function at
the replication forks in vivo, we have conducted detailed ana-
lyses of helicase action and DNA binding of mouse Mcm4/6/7
helicase using various forked and bubble substrate DNAs.

We specifically addressed sequence requirement for the Mcm
helicase activation, mode of interaction with DNA substrates
and whether the thymine sequences are required for continu-
ous activation of Mcm helicase during the unwinding process.
The results indicate that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 primarily
binds to single-stranded DNA region, and that the extent of
helicase activation is related to the thymine content of the
single-stranded segment. Unexpectedly, Mcm4/6/7 helicase
is not capable of efficiently unwinding the GC-rich duplex
segment, suggesting that some other mechanism may be
required for completion of replication of the entire genome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Labeled and unlabeled dNTPs/rNTPs and Sequenase were
purchased from Amersham Pharmacia. M13mp18 and
M13mp19 single-stranded circular DNA, T4 polynucleotide
kinase, DNase I and the Klenow fragment were from
TAKARA, Nuclease P1 was from Roche, and anti-FLAG
M2 Ab (antibody)-agarose and FLAG peptide were from
Sigma. SV40 T-antigen was purified from baculovirus-
infected insect cells as reported (22). PriA helicase protein
was provided by Dr Taku Tanaka (23). Oligonucleotides were
purchased from Hokkaido system science Co., Ltd (Hokkaido,
Japan), and were purified on polyacrylamide gel, followed by
purification by Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridge column (Waters).
Expression and purification of mouse Mcm4/6/7
complex
The recombinant baculoviruses expressing His6-Mcm4/Mcm6
or Mcm7-FLAG proteins were previously described (11). Sf9
and High five insect cells were cultured at 27C in Sf-900 II
SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and EX-CELL 405 medium
(JRH Biosciences), respectively. For expression of the Mcm4/
6/7 proteins, High five cells were coinfected with recombinant
baculoviruses expressing the His6-Mcm4/Mcm6 proteins and
those expressing the Mcm7-FLAG, and were collected at 48 h
post-infection. The recombinant Mcm4/6/7 complexes were
purified as previously described (12).
DNA substrates
The sequences for all the oligonucleotides used for con-
structions of DNA substrates are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
The partial heteroduplex substrates were constructed by
annealing labeled oligonucleotides with M13mp18 single-
stranded circular DNA or its derivative. The labeled substrates
were purified by Sepharose CL4B column chromatography
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
The DNA bubble substrates were assembled from two par-
tially complementary oligonucleotides with top and bottom
strand sequences (Table 1). T-tailed Y-fork substrates were
prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides (dT30 and dT60
series). To construct the arrested fork and 30- or 50-extension
substrates, various combinations of oligonucleotides shown in
Table 1 were annealed. Bub-82/lamin B2 containing the T-rich
strand of the lamin B2 origin region was constructed as pre-
viously described (13). The bubble substrate, c-myc/DUE
or c-myc/DUE-C, contains sequences (GenBank accession
number K01908) from nucleotides 722 to 853 or those from
828 to 747 (complementary strand), respectively, in the central
melted region. For each substrate, labeled oligonucleotide
(3 pmol) was annealed with the unlabeled oligonucleotide
(6 pmol) in a reaction mixture (50 ml) containing 20 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2 and 25 mM NaCl,
which were heated to 95C, kept at 67C for 1 h, and then
allowed to slowly cool down to 37C. The assembled sub-
strates were purified from polyacrylamide gel by elution into
TE buffer (24).
The partial heteroduplex substrates on a single-stranded
circular DNA with varied lengths of duplex regions were
prepared by extending DNA chains from the 30 end of the
dT40-37mer (37mer region hybridizing at positions 6289–
6326 of M13mp18 vector) annealed to the single-stranded

circular DNA. DNA chains were elongated with Sequenase
in the presence of [a-32P]dGTP, followed by extension after
addition of ddGTP and all four dNTPs, resulting in substrates
containing labeled duplex regions of varied lengths (13). The
substrate (5 fmol) was first incubated with indicated amount of
the Mcm4/6/7 complex at 37C for 1 h in reaction mixture as
described (11), and then reactions were stopped by addition
of EDTA (20 mM), SDS (0.1%) and 2mg proteinase K, followed
by incubation for 20 min. Aliquots were electrophoresed on
a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel in 1· TBE at 300 V for 2.5 h.
The single-stranded circular DNAs used were M13mp18
and M13mp19+G-rich. The latter was constructed by inserting
a G-rich repeat sequence (GGGGCGTGGGC)6, prepared by
annealing of two oligonucleotides (50-GATCC-[GGGGCGT-

For DNA helicase assays, the reaction mixtures of the gel shift
assays, as described above, were incubated at 30C for 15 min,
and then the ATP was added at 10 mM, followed by incubation
at 37C for additional 30 min. The reactions were terminated
by addition of EDTA (20 mM), SDS (0.1%) and 2 mg pro-
teinase K, and were incubated for additional 15 min. The
samples were separated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing
polyacrylamide gel in 1· TBE.
Nuclease protection assays
The reaction mixtures (25 ml) contained 25 mM HEPES–
NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM
Mg(CH3COO)2, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mM
ATP-g-S, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 10 fmol of 32P-labeled bubble
substrate, and the indicated amount of Mcm4/6/7 proteins.
After incubation at 30C for 30 min, the indicated amount
of DNase I (TAKARA Biomedical, Japan) was added, and
the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 min.
DNase I was inactivated by the addition of 250 ml of stop
solution (20 mM EDTA, 0.2M sodium chloride, 1% SDS
and 12.5 mg/ml yeast RNA). For nuclease P1 footprinting
assay, binding reactions were carried out under the same con-
ditions except that CaCl2 was omitted. P1 nuclease (0.3 U,
Roche) was added and incubation was continued at 37C for
1 min. Cleavage was stopped by addition of 50 ml of 25 mM
EDTA and 0.4 M NaOH; the mixture was incubated at room
temperature for 10 min followed by the addition of 12 ml of 3 M
sodium acetate (pH 4.8). Proteins were removed by phenol–
chloroform extraction, and DNAs were collected by ethanol
precipitation followed by wash with 70% ethanol. The
digested DNA was subjected to electrophoresis through a
10 or 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 M
urea, followed by autoradiography.
RESULTS
Mcm4/6/7 complex primarily interacts with the
single-stranded DNA segment
Mcm4/6/7 binds to ‘bubble’ DNA substrates and unwinds the
duplex segments when the central single-stranded segment
contains thymine stretches (13). In order to examine the
mode of binding of Mcm4/6/7 on bubble DNAs, we conducted
nuclease protection assays using labeled bubble substrate
DNAs and Mcm4/6/7 in the presence of ATP-g-S which
permits binding to substrate DNA but does not mobilize the
helicase. At an optimum concentration of DNase I, strong
cleavages were detected on the 21 bp duplex regions at
both ends of the substrates, whereas weaker cleavages were
detected on the central single-stranded region, consistent with
preference of DNase I to double-stranded DNA. With the
Bub66/T-rich substrate, strong protection was detected on
the entire single-stranded regions of both top and bottom
strands with increasing concentration of Mcm4/6/7, consistent
with high affinity of Mcm4/6/7 to T-rich bubble sequences
(Figure 1A). Similar, but less significant protection was detec-
ted on the single-stranded DNA segment with P1 nucleases
(Figure 1A), which is specific to single-stranded DNA. The
results indicate that the Mcm complex is loaded onto bubble
DNA through binding to both strands of the single-stranded
region. Careful examination of Mcm4/6/7 footprints on a bub-
ble indicated strong protection on the 50-half of the top strand
and moderate protection on the remaining 30-half, as well as on
several base-pair duplex segment adjacent to the branch point
(Figure 1A and data not shown). A similar pattern of protec-
tion was observed also on the bottom strand. This suggests that
Mcm4/6/7 may bind to a replication bubble substrate with a
2-fold symmetry as a double hexamer (Figure 1A, see the
lower scheme), in a manner similar to SV40 T-antigen (21).
Nuclease protection assays were conducted also on a
T-tailed Y-fork structure (Figure 1B). Not only the single-
stranded tail region but also the 7 bp duplex DNA adjacent
to the duplex-to-single-strand junction were protected by Mcm
binding from DNaseI digestion. These results indicate that
Mcm4/6/7 protein primarily interacts with single-stranded
DNA region and that the interaction also spans the duplex
segments near the branchpoint of the replication fork.
Formation of double hexameric Mcm4/6/7 complexes
facilitates helicase actions on bubble substrates
The above results suggest that Mcm4/6/7 generates a double
hexameric complex on a bubble, each hexamer of which
makes symmetric contact with the 50-proximal central
single-stranded segment. This predicts that the single-
stranded segment needs to be of a sufficient length in order
to accommodate the Mcm complex. In fact, we previously
showed that the Mcm4/6/7 mainly forms a single hexameric
complex on bubble-20 (a bubble substrate with 20 nt long
central single-stranded segment) and a double hexameric
complex on bubble-60 DNA (13). In order to determine the
minimum requirement for double-hexamer formation, a set of
synthetic bubble-like substrates (Bub-T10, Bub-T20, Bub-T30,
Bub-T40 and Bub-T50) that differed in the length of the central
unpaired segment were constructed, and the binding and
helicase activities of Mcm4/6/7 on these substrates were
examined. Mcm4/6/7 was incubated with a radiolabeled
synthetic bubble substrate in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP-
g-S to allow complex formation. A half of these reaction
mixtures were analyzed for DNA binding in gel shift assays
(Figure 2A), and the remainder was further incubated in the
presence of 10 mM ATP to measure DNA helicase activity
(Figure 2B). Bub-10 generated only a low level of complexes
with Mcm4/6/7, and Bub-20 generated primarily a single
mobility-shifted form, which may contain a single hexamer
of Mcm4/6/7. On Bub-30, significant amount of complexes
containing a double hexamer were generated in addition to
those containing a single hexamer (Figure 2A) (13,21). The
amounts of double hexamer complexes increased on Bub-T40
and Bub-T50 with concomitant decrease of single hexamer
complexes (Figure 2A). The results indicate that a single-
stranded segment of at least 40 nt long is required for efficient
loading of the double-hexameric Mcm helicase on a bubble
substrate.
3036 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 9
In DNA helicase assays, Mcm4/6/7 complex did not show
helicase activity on either Bub-10 or Bub-20 substrate. The
efficiency of displacement slightly improved as the length of
the single-stranded segment increased up to 30 nt. On Bub-T40
and Bub-T50, on the other hand, significant displacement was
observed, indicating that a single-stranded segment of at least
40 nt long is required for efficient helicase actions on bubble
substrates (Figure 2B). Taken together, the above results are
consistent with the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 complex, loaded
onto DNA as a double hexameric complex, efficiently unwinds
the duplex region of the substrate DNA.
Both strands of thymine-rich single-stranded segments
are required for efficient unwinding of bubble
DNA by Mcm4/6/7
Symmetric binding of the Mcm4/6/7 double hexamer to bub-
ble suggests that each hexamer catalyzes unwinding of one of
the two duplex segments. We asked whether activation of both
hexamers is required for unwinding of the bubble substrate.
The preferred bubble substrate which is efficiently unwound
by Mcm4/6/7 contains thymine stretches on both strands of the
single-stranded segment. We constructed a hetero-bubble
(Bub66/T–G-rich) in which one strand is T-rich (same as
Bub66/T-rich) and the other strand is G-rich (same as Bub66/
G-rich) (13), and helicase assays were conducted with increas-
ing amount of Mcm4/6/7. Only weak unwinding was detected
on this substrate compared to Bub66/T-rich (Figure 3A). Since
Mcm4/6/7 can bind to Bub66/T–G-rich and forms a double
hexameric complex (data not shown), the defective unwinding
is not due to inefficient loading of the helicase onto the sub-
strate. If one hexamer interacting with the thymine-rich strand
dissociates from the other hexamer and displaces only one of
the duplex segments, then it would result in generation of
Y-fork structures which could not be further displaced due
to the presence of G-rich 30-tail and would appear on the
gel. However, we did not detect such intermediates during
the course of the experiment (Figure 3B), suggesting that

bubble can be displaced efficiently only when two molecules
of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamers are simultaneously activated.
Binding and helicase actions of Mcm4/6/7 on forked and
30- or 50-extension substrates
In order to examine more precisely the interaction and helicase
actions with forked substrates, Y-fork substrates containing
a nascent leading strand (A-fork[30]), nascent lagging strand
(A-fork[50]), or both of them (A-fork[30,50]), as well as
50-extension or 30-extension structures were constructed.
Mcm4/6/7 bound to A-fork[30] or A-fork[50] with affinity
similar to that of a simple Y-fork (Figure 4A and data not
shown). In contrast, PriA helicase, used as a control, bound to
A-fork[30] more efficiently than to A-fork[50], as reported
previously (23,25). Mcm4/6/7 bound also to 50-extension
and 30-extension, albeit with slightly reduced affinity com-
pared to A-fork[30] and A-fork[50] (Figure 4A). Mcm4/6/7
bound to A-fork[30,50] with much lower affinity, and the com-
plex gave rise to a single band. These findings indicate that the
Mcm4/6/7 complex is loaded onto DNA preferentially and
efficiently through single-stranded region, regardless of the
presence of 30- or 50-terminus.
In contrast, only the substrate containing a 30 single-
stranded DNA tail (A-fork[50]) was efficiently unwound and
A-fork[30] or A-fork[30,50], was not unwound by Mcm4/6/7
(Figure 4B). Absence of helicase actions on A-fork[30,50]
composed only of duplex regions is expected since double-
stranded DNA is not able to activate the ATPase activity
of Mcm4/6/7 (10). In contrast, the PriA, a structure-specific
helicase used as a control, binds at the fork junction and
unwinds the fork and the nascent lagging strand DNA on
A-fork[50], or unwinds the nascent lagging strand on
A-fork[30,50], as reported before (25). These results indicate
that the Mcm4/6/7 complex binds to single-stranded DNA
and that its helicase is activated only in the presence of a
single-stranded 30-tail.
30-extension with poly(dT) tail is displaced by Mcm4/6/7
It has been reported that the 30-extension can be unwound by
the archaeal Mcm homohexamer but not by fission and bud-
ding yeast Mcm complexes (14,26,27). We have constructed
30-extension substrates containing poly(dT), poly(dA),
poly(dC) and poly(dG) 30-tails in order to examine whether
mouse Mcm4/6/7 can displace these substrates. We first found
that Mcm4/6/7 binds to dT-, dC- and dG-30-extension with
similar affinity, and to dA-30-extension with much lower affin-
ity (Figure 5A). This is consistent with the previous results that
Mcm4/6/7 binds to 50mer oligo-dT, -dC and -dG, but not to
Figure 2. Binding and helicase actions of mouse Mcm4/6/7 on bubble substrates containing single-stranded segments of varied lengths. Gel shift (A) and DNA
helicase (B) assays were performed with mouse Mcm4/6/7 on synthetic bubble DNAs (4 fmol), Bub-T10, Bub-T20, Bub-T30, Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 (Table 1).

a 50mer oligo-dA (13). We found that dT-tailed 30-extension
was displaced efficiently by Mcm 4/6/7 while almost no or
very little activity was detected on other substrates (Figure 5B
and C). This is in sharp contrast to yeast Mcm4/6/7 helicases
which are not capable of unwinding 30-extension substrates.
Furthermore, dT-tailed 50-extension, to which Mcm4/6/7
could bind, was not displaced by the Mcm helicase. The
addition of the 50-tail to dT-tailed 30-extension further stimu-
lated the displacement (Figure 5D), confirming the previous
report that the fork structures facilitate the helicase action.
Thus, these results further strengthen our conclusion that
the mammalian Mcm helicase is generally activated by the
thymine-stretch on the 30-single-stranded tail.
The effects of the thymine content of the 30-tail on
Mcm helicase activity
We next examined more systematically the effect of the com-
positions of the thymine residues of the 30-tail on the Mcm
helicase activity. A partial heteroduplex M13 single-stranded
DNA containing a 37 bp duplex region in the presence or
absence of the 50 nt long 30-tail of various nucleotide com-
positions were constructed and the unwinding by mouse
Mcm4/6/7 was examined (Figure 6A). Due to its low pro-
cessivity, Mcm4/6/7 barely displaced the annealed 37mer oli-
gonucleotide without a 30-tail (37mer; Figure 6A). Only weak
helicase activity was observed on the substrate carrying the 30-
tail of 25 repeats of TA dinucleotide (37-TA25; Figure 6A),
whereas strong helicase activity was observed on 37-TTA17.
Increase of thymine content on the 30-tail did not further
increase the extent of unwinding (37-TTTA13, 37-TTTTA10
and 37-T50; Figure 6A), suggesting that 17 repeats of TT
dinucleotides (67% thymine) may be sufficient for activation
of Mcm helicase. It should be noted that the TA25 tail would
self-anneal and this would prevent the loading of Mcm, since
the 30-tail containing TTAA13 or TTTAAA8 did not enhance
the unwinding either (data not shown). Therefore, we next
examined the effects of repeating sequences of thymine and
cytosine (Figure 6B). Partial heteroduplex substrates contain-
ing the 30-tail of TC25, TTCC13, TTTCCC8, TTTTCCCC6,
TTCC17 were displaced by the Mcm4/6/7 complex to the extent
similar to that achieved by TTA17, suggesting that 50%
thymine content is sufficient for full activation of Mcm
helicase. TTCC13 and TTCC17 were displaced to a similar
extent, consistent with the earlier result that a 40 nt tail is
sufficient for activation (13). However, the efficiency of the
displacement significantly decreased as the thymine content of
the 30-tail dropped to 33%, as in TAA17 or TCC17 (Figure 6B
and C). Thus, the minimal thymine content required for acti-
vation of the Mcm helicase may be somewhere between 33
and 50%.
DUE sequences from the c-myc origin activate Mcm
helicase
Our previous studies have shown that the sequences containing
periodic (dT)n tracts derived from the human lamin B2 origin
(48% thymine content) can serve as an efficient activator for
the Mcm helicase on a bubble, and replacement of thymines
with guanines abolished the helicase activation (13,28). In
order to examine other natural replication origins with differ-
ent thymine contents for the ability to activate Mcm helicase

Figure 3. Effect of the loss of thymine-rich sequences from one single-strand of
the T-rich bubble on unwinding by Mcm4/6/7. (A) The Mcm4/6/7 helicase
activity was measured by using bubble DNA substrate (4 fmol) containing an
unpaired segment of two thymine-rich sequences (Bub66/T-rich) or that con-
taining thymine- and guanine-rich sequence on each strand (Bub66/T–G-rich).

Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 9 3039
on a bubble substrate, we constructed new bubble substrates,
Bub82/c-myc, containing sequences derived from the DUE
(DNA unwinding element) region of the human c-myc origin
which is essential for c-myc replicator activity (29,30). The
unpaired segment in Bub82/c-myc/DUE contains one strand of
DUE and that in Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C contains another strand.
This DUE is believed to coincide with the initially unwound
region of the c-myc origin (29), and its deletion substantially
reduced the replicator activity (30). Mcm4/6/7 unwound
Bub82/lamin B2 (thymine 48%), Bub82/c-myc/DUE (37%)
and Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C (39%) with similar efficiency
(Figure 7A), indicating that the sequences from the c-myc
origin also can serve as efficient activators of the Mcm
helicase. This result also indicates that sequences with 37%
thymine content can activate Mcm4/6/7 to displace 24 nt
duplex on both sides in a bubble substrate, suggesting that
the not only thymine content but also the sequence context
may affect the Mcm helicase activation.
In gel shift assays, MCM4/6/7 bound to all the three
bubbles, although the affinity to Bub82/c-myc/DUE and to
Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C is slightly lower than that to Bub-82/
lamin B2 (Figure 7B). Therefore, helicase and DNA binding
activities do not necessarily correlate with each other. This
was also indicated by our previous results that guanine and
cytosine stretches can bind to Mcm but cannot activate the
helicase (13).

DNA unwinding by Mcm4/6/7 is inhibited by the
GC-rich sequences on the duplex segment
Our results indicate that thymine-rich single-stranded DNA is
required for initial loading and activation of the Mcm helicase.
However, it is not known whether thymine sequences are
required for processive unwinding of duplex DNA. Therefore,
we have examined whether the nucleotide composition of the
duplex region affects its unwinding activity. To address this
issue, we constructed a series of T-tailed Y-fork structures
(T-fork) containing various sequences in the duplex segment.
They carried varied contents of cytosine residues on the 30-tail
strand. In gel shift assays, Mcm4/6/7 bound to these Y-fork
substrates with identical affinity (Figure 8A), consistent with
the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 binds to single-stranded tails.
However, in DNA helicase assays, T-fork/(C:G)49 was hardly
displaced by Mcm4/6/7, but was readily displaced by SV40 T-
antigen DNA helicase (Figure 8B). When thymine or adenine
is inserted as every third nucleotide (repeats of CCT or CCA),
the extent of unwinding increased (T-fork/(CCT:GGA)16 and
T-fork/(CCA:GGT)16). The efficiency of unwinding is roughly
correlated with the content of GC pairs in the duplex segment

It appears that the duplex segment containing <50% GC
pairs is efficiently unwound (Figure 8C).
We next examined the effect of GC-rich segments on a
partial heteroduplex DNA on a single-stranded circular
DNA. We have constructed two sets of 50-tailed partial
heteroduplex DNA substrates containing duplex regions of
Figure 6. The effects of the nucleotide compositions of the 30-tail on displacement of partial heteroduplex substrates by Mcm4/6/7. (A) DNA helicase assays were

variable lengths; one on M13mp18 vector and the other on
M13mp19 containing a 66 nt long G-rich segment downstream
of the hybridizing oligonucleotide. We found that the Mcm4/6/
7 helicase can displace duplex DNA up to 350 nt long on its
own on the former substrate (Figure 8D, left), consistent with
previous results (13). In contrast, displacement was inhibited
over the GC-rich segments on the latter substrate (Figure 8D,
right panel), although displacement up to 250 nt in length,
albeit at a reduced level, was observed at a high concentra-
tion of Mcm4/6/7 complex. This result is consistent with
that on Y-fork and indicates that GC-rich duplex segment is
inhibitory for unwinding by the Mcm helicase. These results
may indicate that the presence of thymine–adenine pairs with
a certain frequency in the duplex region may facilitate con-
tinuous unwinding by Mcm4/6/7. Alternatively, Mcm4/6/7
is not efficient enough to displace thermodynamically stable
GC-base-paired segment.
In order to distinguish these two possibilities, we designed a
new T-fork substrate containing inosine (I) residue instead of
guanosine residue. The thermal stability of the I:C base pair is
lower than that of the G:C base pair in duplex DNA due to loss
of one hydrogen bond and is even lower than A:T base pair
(31). We constructed the T-tailed fork substrates containing
the (GCC:CGG)10, (GCC:CIG)10 or (GAA:CTT)10 duplex
DNA segment (Figure 8E). Mcm4/6/7 hardly displaced the
31 nt long duplex of GCC:CGG repeats, whereas the T-
fork/(GAA:CTT)10 was displaced efficiently, as described
above. T-fork/(GCC:CIG)10 was displaced with efficiency
much greater than that of T-fork/(GCC:CGG)10, indicating
that the thermostability of the duplex segment, not the lack
of AT base pair, is responsible for inability of Mcm4/6/7 to
displace the duplex.
DISCUSSION
DNA helicase is a central factor for operation of replication
forks. It also plays a crucial role in the initiation step at the
replication origins. Therefore, the elucidation of how the
replicative helicases interact with DNA substrate and how
they are activated is crucial for understanding the molecular
basis of initiation of DNA replication. It is now believed that
Mcm is a major component of the eukaryotic replicative hel-
icase. In this report, we have conducted detailed analyses on
binding and helicase actions of mouse Mcm4/6/7 using various
substrates including fork and bubble structures.
Modes of binding and activation of Mcm4/6/7 helicase on
a bubble structure
Initiation of DNA replication is associated with localized
melting of duplex DNA near replication origins. Helicases
are loaded onto replication forks through the melted region,
induced by initiator binding, in bacteria (32). We previously
reported that Mcm4/6/7 can be loaded onto a bubble-like
structure and can serve as a DNA helicase at the forks (13).
The ability of Mcm4/6/7 to unwind the bubble substrate but
not the conventional duplex DNA (Figures 2 and 13) indicates
that Mcm can be loaded through the single-stranded segment
of the bubble. Furthermore, the Mcm4/6/7 complex displays
marked preference for thymine-rich sequences within the
single-stranded segment for helicase activation (13). The res-
ults in this report indicate that helicase action of Mcm4/6/7 on
synthetic bubbles may depend on the presence of an unpaired
region of sufficient length (at least 40 nt), which may permit
assembly of a double-hexameric complex on the substrate
DNA, similar to SV40 T-antigen protein (Figure 2A) (21).
When one strand of the single-stranded segment in T-rich
bubble was replaced by guanine-rich sequences, the efficiency
of unwinding was significantly reduced.
Our footprinting analyses showed that Mcm4/6/7 strongly
protects 25 nt single-stranded DNA segment adjacent to each
branch point and proximal to 50 ends of both strands of the

bubble. At each fork, one Mcm4/6/7 complex is likely to
encircle the single-stranded DNA strand and two hexamers
may bind symmetrically to the bubble substrate, forming a
double hexameric structure on the bubble (see schematic
drawing of Figure 1A). Efficient unwinding into both direc-
tions may require simultaneous activation of both hexamers
which may sit at the center while extruding the unwound
single-stranded DNA through the rings. This may closely
resemble the proposed modes of binding and helicase actions
of T-antigen (21). Although we cannot totally exclude the
possibility that one Mcm4/6/7 hexamer at each fork unwinds
the duplex independently, ring-shaped structures of mouse and
archea MCM, as revealed by electron microscopy, bear much
similarity to the recently solved structure of the SV40 large
T-antigen (4,6), and are in favor of the double-hexameric
structure of mouse Mcm on a bubble DNA.
Substrate and sequence requirement for Mcm4/6/7
helicase activation
DNA binding assays indicate that Mcm4/6/7 binds to those
substrates containing single-stranded DNA regions regardless
of the presence or absence of single-stranded 30 or 50 end.

single-stranded DNA from 30 to 50 direction. This is most
clearly shown by its helicase action on A-fork[50] and 30-
extension but not on A-fork[30], A-fork[30,50] nor 50-extension.
However, it does not necessarily require 30 end of single-
stranded DNA, since Mcm4/6/7 can displace annealing oligo-
nucleotide on a circular single-stranded DNA. The ability of
the mouse Mcm4/6/7 to unwind 30-extension is shared by the
archaeal Mcm helicase but not by Mcm4/6/7 from S.pombe
and S.cerevisiae (14,26,27). The archaeal Mcm can unwind
A-fork[30] but eukaryotic Mcm4/6/7 cannot, since the former
binds to double-stranded DNA but the latter does not (5,27).
While yeast Mcm helicases can translocate on duplex DNA,
such activity was not observed with mammalian Mcm4/6/7
(data not shown).
Occurrence of AT-rich sequences, with asymmetric distri-
bution of adenine and thymine, near the replication origins, lead
us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation
sites of mammalian DNA replication, and prompted us to exam-
ine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to
activate Mcm4/6/7 helicase. Both lamin-B2 and c-myc origins
served as efficient activator for Mcm helicase in vitro. Consist-
ent with it, site-specific loading of Mcm in the DNA replication
initiation zone of the c-myc was recently reported (33).
We have examined in detail the effect of sequence context of
the single-stranded DNA on the helicase activity of Mcm. The
results indicate that thymine content of 50% is sufficient for
the maximum helicase activity. The efficiency of displacement
decreased as the thymine content of the 30-tail dropped to
33% (Figure 6). The stretches of thymine residues may not
be necessarily required, since repeats of TC dinucleotides
served as a potent activator for Mcm4/6/7. We also noticed
that the presence of a secondary structure within the single-
stranded DNA is inhibitory for helicase action. Nuclease foot-
printing assays indicated that binding was interfered by the
secondary structure (data not shown). Thus, we have concluded
that Mcm4/6/7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non-
structured single-stranded DNA with thymine content of 50%
or more, although significant stimulation is observed also by
DNA with less thymine content (Figure 7), suggesting that the
sequence specificity for Mcm helicase activation is rather
relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on
the sequence context. This would be reasonable given the flex-
ibility and differential regulation of site selection for initiation
of DNA replication during development or in various cell types,
as well as the variability in initiation potential of each replica-
tion origin on the genome even within the single cell type.
Mcm4/6/7 helicase during processive unwinding
at the fork
The specific requirement of single-stranded thymine residues
for activation of Mcm helicase prompted us to examine
whether they are required also for processive unwinding of
duplex DNA. Our results indicated that increase of GC pair in
the duplex segment significantly inhibited the Mcm helicase
activity. Duplex DNA composed only of GC pairs (10 repeats
of CGG) on a Y-fork was not displaced at all, while the same
template was readily displaced by SV40 T-antigen (Figure 8B).
Mcm helicase was inhibited by the presence of GC-rich duplex
segment also on a circular single-stranded partial heteroduplex
substrate. However, on this substrate, Mcm4/6/7 was able to
displace DNA past the GC-rich region, albeit to a limited
extent, when it was added at a high concentration. On the
partial heteroduplex template, Mcm is loaded onto the circular
single-stranded DNA of 6.4 kb, while it is loaded onto the
50 nt long 30-tail DNA on the Y-fork. Thus, the difference of
helicase actions may reflect the efficiency of Mcm loading.
Alternatively, the presence of ‘random’ sequence at the ini-
tially unwound duplex segment in the former template may
engage the Mcm helicase in a more active conformation which
can displace the GC-rich duplex segment.
On Y-fork substrates, increase of AT base pairs in the
duplex (10 repeats of CTT) restored the unwinding. These
results indicate either that thymine residues are required on
the duplex DNA for continuous unwinding, or that Mcm4/6/7
is simply not efficient enough to unwind the stable GC pairs.
Replacement of the central guanosine with inosine in the CGG
repeat duplex DNA resulted in displacement (Figure 8E) (31),
suggesting that the continuous presence of AT base pair may
not be essential for the Mcm helicase function and that the
thermostability of GC base pairs is inhibitory for helicase
action of Mcm4/6/7.
The results described in this manuscript reveal potentially
important features of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 helicase, which is
likely to be a key component of the eukaryotic replicative
helicase. Prior to initiation of DNA replication, Mcm helicase
may adopt a double hexameric complex at the partially melted
origin region, and may catalyze concurrent unwinding of
duplex DNA into both directions, while stably associated
with the origins of DNA replication. This is similar to the
T-antigen model originally proposed by Smelkova and
Borowiec (21). We propose that, only when both hexamers
are activated by the interacting thymine-rich sequences pre-
sent within the melted region, the Mcm helicase is mobilized
and initiation takes place. A crucial question is how these
double hexameric helicase complexes are generated and
turn into active helicases at the origins. This process would
involve melting of duplex DNA, which may be facilitated by
binding of preRC components in the context of proper chro-
matin structures, or by other unwinding factors including a
topoisomerase or a newly identified Mcm8 helicase (34–36). It
may also require association of fork-assisting proteins such as
Cdc45 (37,38) as well as phosphorylation events by Cdk and
Cdc7 kinases (39,40). One unexpected finding of this study is
low helicase activity of Mcm4/6/7 on GC-rich duplex DNA.
This, in conjunction with the low processivity of Mcm4/6/7
helicase, strongly indicates that the replicative helicase at
the replication forks would require more than Mcm4/6/7
complex. During the processive unwinding of duplex DNA
replication forks, Mcm4/6/7 may be further stimulated by
interaction with other proteins, including remaining Mcm sub-
units, Cdc45 (37,38), GINS (41,42), DNA polymerase sub-
units (43), Mcm8 (35,36), etc. to become a truly processive
and potent helicase capable of replicating the entire genome.
