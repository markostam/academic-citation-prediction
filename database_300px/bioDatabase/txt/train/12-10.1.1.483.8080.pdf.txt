ABSTRACT
Long Interspersed Elements (LINE-1s, L1s) are the
most active mobile elements in the human genome
and account for a significant fraction of its mass.
The propagation of L1 in the human genome requires
disruption and repair of DNA at the site of integration.
As Barbara McClintock first hypothesized, genotoxic
stress may contribute to the mobilization of trans-
posable elements, and conversely, element mobility
may contribute to genotoxic stress. We tested the
ability of genotoxic agents to increase L1 retrotrans-
position in a cultured cell assay. We observed that
cells exposed to gamma radiation exhibited
increased levels of L1 retrotransposition. The L1
retrotransposition frequency was proportional to
the number of phosphorylated H2AX foci, an indicator
of genotoxic stress. To explore the role of the L1
endonuclease in this context, endonuclease-
deficient tagged L1 constructs were produced and
tested for their activity in irradiated cells. The activity
of the endonuclease-deficient L1 was very low in
irradiated cells, suggesting that most L1 insertions
in irradiated cells still use the L1 endonuclease.
Consistent with this interpretation, DNA sequences
that flank L1 insertions in irradiated cells harbored
target site duplications. These results suggest that
increased L1 retrotransposition in irradiated cells is
endonuclease dependent. The mobilization of L1 in
irradiated cells potentially contributes to genomic
instability and could be a driving force for secondary
mutations in patients undergoing radiation therapy.
INTRODUCTION
L1s are autonomous mobile elements that have proliferated
throughout eukaryotic genomes for hundreds of millions of
years (1). In humans, L1s comprise 17% of the mass of the
genome (2). An active L1 propagates via an RNA intermedi-
ate. L1 RNA not only serves as a cDNA template but also
encodes the two L1 proteins, ORF1 and ORF2, both of which
are required for retrotransposition (3,4). Because L1 retro-
transposition involves the insertion of DNA into random
sites in the genome, L1 has the capacity to disrupt genes
(5) and contribute to genetic instability (6,7).
The generation of a new genomic L1 copy requires the
disruption and repair of DNA. It is likely that most
L1s enter the genome via a pathway that uses the element-
encoded endonuclease to create a nick in the target DNA that
produces a free DNA end that can be used as a cDNA primer.
This process of target primed reverse transcription is based
mainly on elegant studies with the non-LTR retrotransposon
R2Bm (8,9). The R2Bm element-encoded endonuclease cre-
ates sequential staggered DNA breaks at the genomic target
site (10). A similar mechanism likely operates for L1 insertion,
albeit at a less specific target site (50-TTTT/A-30) (6,7,11–14).
It is less clear how, after first-strand L1 cDNA synthesis,
the second strand is created and the insertion site is repaired.
Non-homologous recombination machinery may use short
stretches of sequence homology between the L1 cDNA and
the genomic insertion flank to patch the 50 end of a nascent
L1 insertion and/or prime second strand cDNA synthesis
(7,15–18). Using a bioinformatic analysis, it has recently
been reported that the 50 ends of truncated L1 insertions con-
tain short stretches of microhomology to the target site,
whereas longer L1 insertions and Alu elements do not show
this pattern (19). These and other findings (see below) suggest
that there is more than one pathway by which L1s can breach
genomic DNA.
L1s can also enter the genome in a manner that does not
require L1 endonuclease. An endonuclease-deficient tagged
L1 element can retrotranspose, albeit with greatly diminished
activity compared to the wild type tagged L1 element (20).
Presumably, this endonuclease-deficient L1 inserts into
pre-existing DNA breaks. This hypothesis is supported by
studies that document that other mobile elements, including
retrotransposons, can insert into DNA breaks (21–23).

Endonuclease-deficient L1s can retrotranspose at high
frequencies in cells deficient in non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) DNA repair, lending further credence to the idea that
L1 insertions can integrate and possibly repair double strand
DNA breaks (24,25).
To determine if L1s insert into pre-formed DNA breaks in
cells with intact DNA repair machinery, L1 retrotransposition
was analyzed in tissue culture cells that were subjected to
different forms of DNA damage. Here, we report that retro-
transposition of a tagged L1 element increases in cultured cells
that are subjected to gamma irradiation, a source of genotoxic
stress that produces double strand DNA breaks. We document
a dose-dependent increase in phosphorylated H2AX foci, an
indicator of genotoxic stress, under the conditions of the L1
retrotransposition assay. To determine whether L1 insertions
in gamma irradiated cells require the L1 endonuclease,
genomic DNA flanking the L1 insertions was isolated and
sequenced. The sequences harbored evidence of conventional,
endonuclease-dependent L1 insertion. Furthermore, the retro-
transposition activity of an endonuclease-deficient L1 element
did not significantly increase when cells were subjected to
gamma irradiation. Taken together, these findings suggest
that L1 usually enters the genome via an endonuclease-
dependent pathway in cells subjected to gamma irradiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recombinant DNA plasmids
All plasmids consist of the L1RP element tagged with an
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cassette (pL1RP-
EGFP) in a pCEP4 backbone (Invitrogen) as described previ-
ously (26). The L1 element is driven by its 50-UTR and an
upstream CMV MIE promoter. L1-EGFP (EF06R) was
derived from L1RP-EGFP by blunt ligation of 1–1392 nt of
pPur (BD/Clontech) into the NruI site of pCEP4. A negative
control ‘dead’ L1-EGFP (EF05J) was similarly derived from
pL1RP(JM111)-EGFP, which contains disabling mutations in
ORF1 (3). A positive control with constitutive EGFP expres-
sion (EF03N) was derived from pEGFP-N1 (BD/Clontech) by
cloning pPur into the EcoO191 site of pEGFP-N1. An EN
plasmid (EF13E) was created by swapping 1927–3708 nt (Age
I–Bcl I) from JM102D205A (24), which contains a point muta-
tion in the EN domain, into EF06R. A control plasmid (EF12J)
was similarly derived from JM102 (3). JM102 and
JM102D205A are derived from L1.3, which differs from
L1RP by 10 base changes in the region swapped.
Cell lines
The 143B human osteosarcoma cells were a gift from
H. Kazazian (University of Pennsylvania) and CHO-K1
cells from J. Moran (University of Michigan). Both 143B
and CHO-K1 cells were cultured at 37C, 5% CO2 and
100% humidity in DMEM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (US Biotechnologies) and 100 U/ml of
penicillin and streptomycin.
Gamma irradiation
On day 0, 1 · 105 adherent 143B cells were transfected with
1 mg of L1 plasmid and 0.2 mg of DsRed-Express-N1
(Clontech) in 6 ml FuGENE6 (Roche) and 100 ml OptiMEM
(Gibco BRL). On day 2, cells were harvested with Versene
[2% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] and irradiated
with 0–4 Gy using a 137Cesium source. Cells were returned to
culture, harvested on day 8, and the percentage of EGFP+ cells
analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCaliber), gating on live
cells by forward/side scatter and ToPro3 exclusion. Transfec-
tion efficiency was normalized using DsRed (BD Bios-
ciences). Alternately, cells were selected for transfection
with 0.6 mg/ml of puromycin on days 4–6 and analyzed by
flow cytometry on day 12.
Other chemotherapeutic agents
The 143B cells were transfected as above. Cells were exposed
to genotoxic agents for 1 h on day 2 in standard culture con-
ditions, washed twice with PBS and returned to culture.
Agents tested were arsenite (Sigma, in PBS), calicheamicin
g1 [gift from Wyeth, in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)], camp-
tothecin (Sigma, in DMSO) and cisplatin (Sigma, in PBS).
Etoposide (Sigma, in DMSO) exposure was for 10 min. Ultra-
violet irradiation was performed in a Stratalinker (Stratagene)
with cells in 3 mm depth of PBS.
DNA damage quantification
Cells grown on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized with
3.5% paraformaldehyde + 1% TritonX-100, washed with PBS
and blocked with KB (0.01 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1%
BSA, 0.1% Na Azide). Coverslips were stained with mouse
anti-phosphorylated H2AX (Upstate, Charlottesville) and
washed first 1· with 0.1% Triton in PBS and then 2· with
KB. Secondary staining was with anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594
(Molecular Probes, Eugene), and nuclei were visualized by
DAPI staining (Sigma). Stained cells were examined with a
100X PlanNeofluor objective mounted on a Nikon TE-200
microscope. For assessments of H2AX foci, the number of
foci detectable in each nucleus was counted by focusing
through the entire thickness of the nucleus and recording
the number of foci from all levels. At least 300 cells were
counted per time point/treatment. Images were captured with a
Hammamatsu CCD camera.
Quantitative RT–PCR
The 143B cells were disrupted in a QiaShredder column
(Qiagen) and RNA was extracted using RNeasy columns
(Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 100 ng
of RNA was reverse transcribed from a primer in the L1 30-
UTR (SV40rev-TCCAAACTCATCAATGTATCTTATCAT)
using Taqman Multiscribe (ABI). Quantitative real-time PCR
was performed using High Capacity cDNA archive kit (ABI)
and detected on a PRISMR 7900HT (ABI) using a custom
designed TaqmanL1 probe/primer (ABI). GAPDH was simil-
arly quantified using random hexamer reverse transcription
and human GAPDH Taqman probe/primers (ABI). Data
were analyzed using SDS 2.2.1 (ABI) and Excel.
Cloning and sequencing of genomic flanks
EGFP+ clones were handpicked or isolated by flow cytometry
(FACSDiva). Clones were expanded in culture for 2 weeks,
and DNA purified using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). Amplification
was either by inverse PCR as previously described (27) or by
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 4 1197
modified suppression PCR (28). For suppression PCR,
genomic DNA was digested by Ase1, EcoR1 or HindIII
(New England Biolabs). A linker/dummy combination was
annealed and ligated (New England Biolabs) to the digested
genomic DNA: ATlink-GTGGCGGCCAGTATTCGTAGG-
AGGGCGCGTAGATAGAACG. Excess linkers were
removed with Centricon-40 columns (Princeton Separations).
Genomic flanks were amplified using a primer in the linker
ATX-GTGGCGGCCAGTATTC and seminested primers in
L1-EGFP: SV40for1-ATGATAAGATACATTGATGAGTT-
TGGA and SV40for2-GGACAAACCACAACTAGAATGC.
The primary PCR was done in a reaction volume of 25 ml
containing 1 mM SV40for1, 50 nM ATX, 1· FailSafe buffer D,
4% DMSO, 1.25 U FailSafe Taq (Epicentre) and 8 ml linked
DNA. Amplification used the following cycling conditions:
68 for 5 s (extension of dummy), 94 for 4 min (primary
denaturation), followed by 40 cycles at 94 for 30 s, 85 for
10 s, 75 for 10 s, 63 for 30 s and 68 for 120 s, with a final
extension at 68 for 10 min. The secondary PCR was done in a
reaction volume of 20 ml containing 1 mM SV40for2, 50 nM
ATX, 50 mM dNTPs, 1· PCR buffer D, 4% DMSO, 1.25 U
FailSafe Taq and 1 ml primary PCR product. Amplification
used the following cycling conditions: 94 for 4 min, followed
by 40 cycles at 94 for 30 s, 63 for 30 s and 68 for 120 s, with
a final extension at 68 for 10 min. PCR products were run on a
0.8% agarose gel and extracted by QIAQuick (Qiagen), TA
cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and transformed into One-
Shot bacteria (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was extracted from
expanded clones by QiaPrep (Qiagen) and sequenced. The 30
flank DNA was localized in the human genome using Mega-
BLAST against the NCBI database and 50 primers were
generated from upstream sequence (IDT DNA). The 50
flank was amplified using insertion-specific primers as well
as primers in L1 (L1ORF1AS: GGTTGTTCCTTTCCATGT-
TTAGC, L1RP3435AS: GCTGTGAATCCATCTGGTCC,
and HSVtk: CCGATTCGCAGCGCATCGCCTT). The PCR
was performed in a reaction volume of 20 ml containing
300 nM of each primer, 50 mM dNTPs, 1· PCR buffer I
(Roche), 1.5 U TaqGold (Roche) and 200 ng genomic
DNA and used the following cycling conditions: 95 for
10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 for 25 s, 58 for 30 s
and 72 for 210 s, with a final extension at 72 for 10 min. PCR
products were isolated and sequenced as above.
RESULTS
Gamma radiation increases L1 retrotransposition in a
cultured cell assay
The use of a transient plasmid-based assay offers unique
advantages for determining the mechanism of genotoxic-
induced L1 mobility. A plasmid-based assay measures retro-
transposition directly rather than as a by-product of L1 activity
such as L1 RNA or protein levels. By studying the activity of a
single active element, the retrotransposition assay is not con-
founded by the genomic context of different elements. To
determine if DNA damage affects L1 mobility, L1 retrotrans-
position frequency was measured in a cultured cell assay in the
presence and absence of gamma radiation (Figure 1A). This
assay made use of an active human element, L1RP, tagged
with an EGFP reporter as described previously (26). An L1
insertion of sufficient length into a transcriptionally permissive
location in the genome will express EGFP. In human 143B
osteosarcoma cells selected for the presence of the L1-EGFP
plasmid with puromycin, 2 and 4 Gy of gamma radiation
increased the percentage of EGFP+ cells (Figure 1B). At
these doses, DSBs generated were also proportional to radi-
ation exposure, suggesting a correlation between DNA dam-
age and retrotransposition (Figure 3A). A functionally inactive
L1 with two missense mutations in ORF1 (3) showed no
detectable retrotransposition with or without irradiation
(data not shown), indicating that the radiation-induced
increase in EGFP+ cells was specific to the L1 retrotransposi-
tion mechanism. Because inhibition of protein synthesis by
puromycin may act independently or in concert with radiation
to increase retrotransposition (29), the experiment was also
performed without antibiotic selection. Without antibiotic
selection, gamma radiation again increased the percentage
of EGFP+ cells up to 3-fold over mock treated cells (Supple-
mentary Figure 1). A further consideration is that the L1-EGFP
expression plasmids used in this study may be themselves
sensitive to the genotoxic treatments. To test this, we measured
the transcriptional activity of the L1 plasmid by quantifying
L1-EGFP RNA via quantitative strand specific real-time
PCR. L1-EGFP RNA levels were indistinguishable between
irradiated and unirradiated cells at 3 and 24 h post-radiation
(Supplementary Figure 2). This suggests that plasmid tran-
scription and copy number remain constant in the face of
gamma radiation.

Other genotoxic agents do not increase L1
retrotransposition in 143B cells
If damaged DNA serves as a preferred substrate for L1
insertion (Figure 2), then other DNA damaging agents besides
gamma radiation should increase the L1 retrotransposition
frequency. Therefore, L1 retrotransposition was monitored
in cells subjected to a variety of DNA damage agents.
These agents had various mechanisms of action, including
oxidative damage, topoisomerase inhibition and adduct forma-
tion. Only gamma radiation resulted in increased L1 retro-
transposition (Table 1).

for L1 insertion. Insertions at pre-formed DNA breaks may not require L1 endonuclease; genomic DNA flanking such insertions is expected to lack target site
duplications and contain deletions. Right arrow: gamma irradiation may make the host environment more amenable to retrotransposition by upregulating cofactors or
downregulating repressors for endonuclease-dependent retrotransposition. An alternative pathway (not shown) is that L1 inserts near DSBs in irradiated cells, but
still uses its endonuclease to cleave and/or process DNA at the integration site. This alternative is discussed in the text.

Gamma radiation and calicheamicin g1 generate similar
numbers of H2AX foci
One possible interpretation of the chemotherapy experiments
is that toxicity was reached before a comparable level of
genotoxic stress was achieved. To investigate this issue, we
focused on the capacity of gamma irradiation and
calicheamicin g1 treatment to induce gH2AX foci.
Calicheamicin g1 was chosen for this more detailed analysis
because of its higher activity in producing DSBs than the other
chemotherapeutic agents (30). To monitor DNA damage, cells
were subjected to g irradiation or calicheamicin g1 treatment
and stained for phosphorylated H2AX foci (gH2AX). gH2AX
foci appear rapidly, persist for hours and are proportional to
the number of DSBs [Figure 3A, (31,32)]. When gH2AX foci
were measured 6 h after treatment, 5–10 pM calicheamicin g1
elicited a comparable number of foci to 4 Gy of gamma radi-
ation (Figure 3B). Cell viability was also comparable between
calicheamicin g1 and gamma radiation in this dose range (data
not shown). One possible reason for this result is that DSBs per
se are not responsible for increasing the retrotransposition
frequency in irradiated cells. Alternatively, DSBs are still
the relevant lesion, but gamma radiation differs from other
forms of DNA damage in the structure or kinetics of DSB
production. According to this latter alternative, even though
the number of H2AX foci is similar, the type of DNA damage
and/or longevity of the damage may differ between radiation
and calicheamicin g1.
Endonuclease-deficient L1 retrotransposition in
irradiated cells
To further investigate the potential role of DSBs in activating
L1 retrotransposition, we set out to determine whether the
increased retrotransposition frequency in gamma irradiated
cells required L1 endonuclease. If radiation-induced DNA
breaks were preferred substrates for insertion, then an
endonuclease-deficient L1 element should exhibit increased
retrotransposition in the presence of radiation-induced DNA
damage. A hybrid L1RP/L1.3 element was generated that uses
the EGFP reporter and harbors a mutation abrogating endo-
nuclease function (Figure 4A) (24). L1RP has greater activity
than L1.3 in a retrotransposition assay (26,33). There are 10 nt
differences causing three changed amino acids in the swapped
region between L1.3 and L1RP (34,35). Because these
sequence differences have uncharacterized effects on retro-
transposition rates, the parental L1.3 was also swapped for
use as an endonuclease-competent control (Figure 4A). Retro-
transposition activity of these elements was tested in CHO-K1
cells, previously shown to support high levels of
endonuclease-independent retrotransposition (24). Following
irradiation, an increased fraction of CHO-K1 cells transfected
with the endonuclease-competent L1-EGFP expressed EGFP
(Figure 4B). Gamma radiation is therefore able to increase
retrotransposition in an additional mammalian cell line. In
contrast, cells transfected with an endonuclease-deficient L1
did not exhibit a statistically significant increase in retro-
transposition following irradiation (Figure 4C). Therefore,
most of the increased retrotransposition in the setting of
gamma radiation probably occurs via an endonuclease-
dependent pathway.
Genomic flanks of novel insertions have
endonuclease-dependent features
To confirm that L1 integration in the setting of gamma radi-
ation occurs mainly via an endonuclease-dependent pathway,
genomic sequences flanking L1 insertions were cloned. Irra-
diated cells that expressed EGFP were isolated by flow cyto-
metry and expanded in tissue culture. Suppression PCR and
inverse PCR were used to characterize the genomic flanks of
new L1 insertions (see Materials and Methods). Typical
endonuclease-dependent insertions have 7–20 bp target site
duplications, an AT rich target site and a poly-A tail, as
evidenced by an insertion cloned from an unirradiated 143B
cell (Figure 5A) (36). In contrast, endonuclease-independent
Figure 3. Gamma irradiation and calicheamicin g1 generate comparable num-
bers of gH2AX foci. 143B cells were permeabilized and fixed 6 and 24 h after
exposure to gamma irradiation (54 and 72 h post-transfection). Double strand
breaks were detected by staining for gH2AX. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI
staining. (A) Fluorescent images showing gH2AX foci at 6 and 24 h post-

insertions lack these features and may instead contain large
deletions, cDNA transduction or 30 element truncation
(13,14,24). Insertion flanks sequenced from irradiated cells
had features consistent with endonuclease-dependent retro-
transposition (Figure 5B). All had target site duplications,
AT rich target sites, and three resided within older mobile
elements.
To ensure that the method of recovering L1 insertion flanks
could recover endonuclease-independent insertions, an inser-
tion from an endonuclease-deficient L1 was cloned. This inser-
tion lacked target site duplications and had a large deletion at
the site of insertion when compared with the corresponding

terials and Methods). The 50 flank was then amplified and sequenced using
primers designed from the human genome database. Hallmarks of

genomic empty site (Figure 5C). In addition, SINE cDNA
capture occurred at the 50 end of this L1 insertion. SINE
capture has been described previously for endonuclease-
independent L1 insertions (23). These data suggest that,
despite large numbers of gamma radiation-induced DNA
breaks, L1 insertion usually occurs via an endonuclease-
dependent pathway. Exposure to gamma radiation therefore
probably changes the cellular environment in a manner that is
favorable for endonuclease-dependent retrotransposition.
The analysis of L1 insertion flanks revealed some additional
interesting features. A 50 inversion, a feature common to
genomic L1 insertions, was identified in one of the insertions
(17). This inversion was unusually long, as were many of the
insertions sequenced. Long insertions have been associated
with highly active elements and may occur naturally in
143B cells. In addition, two of the insertions were in introns.
Insertion of L1 sequences near or in genes has been noted to
alter transcription, disrupt coding sequences and interfere with
transcriptional elongation (5,37,38).
DISCUSSION
Gamma radiation increases L1 retrotransposition
L1 retrotransposition increases when cultured cells are sub-
jected to gamma radiation. Using different assay conditions,
gamma radiation increased L1 retrotransposition up to 4-fold.
The increase is most evident in the presence of antibiotic
selection for the L1-EGFP plasmid. L1 retrotransposition is
also increased following irradiation without antibiotic selec-
tion. The lower retrotransposition frequencies in assays with-
out antibiotic selection are due in part to measurement of
EGFP at an earlier time point. The frequency of EGFP+
cells is known to increase for at least the first week of the
assay (26). Antibiotic exposure may also help drive retrotrans-
position by increasing the copy number of the L1 plasmid or
by acting as a stressor in concert with irradiation. The increase
in L1 retrotransposition is proportional to the dose of gamma
radiation in the 0–4 Gy range. These doses induce many DNA
breaks per cell, as measured by staining for gH2AX foci.
Increased retrotransposition following irradiation was obse-
rved in two different immortalized cell lines, 143B human
osteosarcoma cells and CHO-K1 Chinese hamster ovary
cells. These cell lines were chosen for this analysis because
they were known to support high levels of L1 retrotransposi-
tion (24,39). Increased retrotransposition following irradiation
in both cell types suggests that the increase in L1 activity is not
a unique peculiarity of a single species or cell line.
Endonuclease-dependent retrotransposition likely
predominates following gamma radiation
We considered whether gamma radiation promoted integration
of L1 into DSBs. To address this possibility, we compared the
retrotransposition frequency of an endonuclease-deficient
L1 in irradiated and unirradiated cells. Despite inducing a
significant number of gH2AX foci, no significant increase
in endonuclease-deficient retrotransposition was observed.
In addition, calicheamicin g1, while creating comparable
numbers of H2AX foci to gamma irradiation, did not increase
L1 mobility.
The analysis of genomic sequences flanking insertions also
favors the predominant use of an endonuclease-dependent
pathway in irradiated cells. All five genomic flanks had target
site duplications, used A/T rich target sites and had poly-A
tails. In four out of the five insertions cloned from irradiated
cells, the flanking DNA sequences were perfectly intact (data
not shown). In contrast, the genomic DNA flanking an
endonuclease-deficient L1 insertion harbored a deletion and
lacked target site duplications. These data are consistent with
an endonuclease-dependent pathway of L1 entry in irradiated
cells. The deletions in the endonuclease-deficient L1 insertion
are consistent with L1 entry into a DSB that is repaired by an
error-prone form of NHEJ. However, one of the insertions in
irradiated cells did have unusual features, including the loss of
3 nt at the target site and inversions of both the genomic
flanking sequence and the L1 sequence. Specifically, 10
bases of the 50 genomic flank were inverted, as well as 7
bases of the L1 proximal to the point of 50 truncation.
These features are similar to recently described L1 insertions
containing palindromic sequences (14). This insertion may
reveal unusual enzymatic properties of the L1 machinery or
could be due to the minority of L1s entering into a DSB that is
repaired by error-prone NHEJ. We also note that the absence
of prominent deletions does not rule out the possibility that
L1s may have inserted near DSBs (but outside of the
sequenced region which in some clones extends several hun-
dred bases). An alternative possibility is that many DSBs in
irradiated 143B cells are repaired by a non-error-prone form of
NHEJ, in which case a repaired break near the L1 insertion
would not look different from the uninterrupted genomic
flanking sequence.
Overall, the simplest interpretation of the endonuclease-
deficient L1 experiment and the flanking sequence analysis
is that L1 usually retrotransposes via an endonuclease-
dependent pathway in irradiated cells. At first glance, these
results may seem inconsistent with earlier studies that docu-
ment the insertion of L1 elements into pre-formed DNA
breaks. However, in those earlier studies L1 integration events
into DNA breaks either conferred a selective advantage or
were assayed using methods designed to specifically recover
insertions into breaks (21–24). Interestingly, XRCC4 deficient
cells support increased absolute numbers of endonuclease-
independent insertions, while DNA-PKcs deficient cells
have fewer insertions relative to parental lines (24). One pos-
sibility is that endonuclease-independent insertion is favored
at the sites of persistently unrepaired breaks, but requires the
assistance of early steps of the DNA repair cascade for tar-
geting to breaks or resolution of integration. In contrast, in the
present study, the cells had a largely intact DNA repair appar-
atus, so breaks were presumably repaired swiftly.
Endonuclease-dependent integration also predominates in
published surveys of L1 insertions in the human genome and in
tissue culture assays. An in silico survey of 399 human-
specific L1 insertions identified only two with possible
endonuclease-independent features (40). Because large dele-
tions often accompany endonuclease-independent L1 inser-
tions, it is possible that such insertions were selected
against during evolution. However, the analysis of new L1
insertions in cultured cells also reveals a predominance of
what appear to be endonuclease-dependent integration events
(6,7,14). Thus, when faced with multiple DNA breaks, a cell
1202 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 4
appears to use conserved mechanism of DNA repair, if intact.
L1 mediated DNA break repair appears to be infrequent
compared to conventional, endonuclease-dependent retro-
transposition.
Genotoxic agents and L1 mobility
That gamma radiation increases L1 retrotransposition has
potential implications for individuals who have been exposed
to radiation (41,42). Previous studies have documented L1’s
ability to insert into pre-existing DNA breaks (24), whereas the
present study implies that most L1 insertions in cells subjected
to gamma radiation occur via an endonuclease-dependent
pathway. The L1 endonuclease is potentially highly damaging
to genomic integrity, and, like gamma irradiation, produces a
cellular response in the form of gH2AX foci (43).
Evidence from the literature suggests that gamma radiation
is not unique in mobilizing L1. An increase in L1 retro-
transposition has been associated with chronic exposure to
the carcinogens mercury, cadmium and nickel, but not other
heavy metals (44). In Drosophila, activation of L1-like
retrotransposons (I-factors) can be enhanced by treating react-
ive females with gamma radiation or with inhibitors of
nucleotide synthesis (45). In mouse cells exposed to etoposide,
a human Alu SINE (thought to utilize L1 retrotransposition
machinery) exhibited increased endonuclease-dependent
retrotransposition (46).
It is possible that some forms of genotoxic stress cannot
mobilize L1s, either because they cause different types of
DNA damage or induce a different cellular response to the
damage. This could make some forms of genotoxic therapy
safer than others in terms of their risk of producing secondary
genetic changes due to L1 mobilization. Alternatively or in
addition, some genotoxic agents may cause toxicity or cell
death before exerting a measurable influence on L1 retrotrans-
position. Given the potential toxicity of L1 mobilization, it
seems reasonable to speculate that cells with a greater resist-
ance to cell cycle check point arrest and apoptosis would be
more likely to survive genotoxic stress and L1 mobilization.
Unfortunately, the cells most likely to achieve this pernicious
state of L1 and DNA damage induced genomic instability are
probably the tumor cells.
