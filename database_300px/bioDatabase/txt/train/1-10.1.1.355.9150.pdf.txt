ABSTRACT
Silencing specificity is a critical issue in the thera-
peutic applications of siRNA, particularly in the
treatment of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
diseases where discrimination against single
nucleotide variation is demanded. However, no
generally applicable guidelines are available for
the design of such allele-specific siRNAs. In this
paper, the issue was approached by using a
reporter-based assay. With a panel of 20 siRNAs
and 240 variously mismatched target reporters,
we first demonstrated that the mismatches
were discriminated in a position-dependent order,
which was however independent of their sequence
contexts using position 4th, 12th and 17th as
examples. A general model was further built for
mismatch discrimination at all positions using 230
additional reporter constructs specifically designed
to contain mismatches distributed evenly along the
target regions of different siRNAs. This model was
successfully employed to design allele-specific
siRNAs targeting disease-causing mutations of
PIK3CA gene at two SNP sites. Furthermore,
conformational distortion of siRNA-target duplex
was observed to correlate with the compromise of
gene silencing. In summary, these findings could
dramatically simplify the design of allele-specific
siRNAs and might also provide guide to increase
the specificity of therapeutic siRNAs.
INTRODUCTION
RNAi is an evolutionarily conserved process where
small interfering RNA (siRNA) speciﬁcally represses the
expression of target genes (1,2). siRNAs are widely
expected to become next generation of biological thera-
peutics (3,4), and they are initially anticipated to play a
major role in treatment of diseases involving single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) where discrimination
against single nucleotide variation between wild-type and
mutant alleles is demanded (5–8). This dream was then
hammered by subsequent reports demonstrating that
siRNAs could incur widespread knockdown of unrelated
genes, a phenomenon known as ‘oﬀ-target eﬀects’ (9–12).
Closer scrutiny of ‘oﬀ-target eﬀects’ of siRNA has
however revealed the Janus-like view of siRNA in term
of target speciﬁcity. On one hand, siRNA does induce
weak down-regulations on sites that are apparently only
related to the siRNA by matching to the seed region (13).
On the other hand, siRNA could discriminate some
very closely related target sites with only two or even
one nucleotide mismatches (14,15). Nobody knows how
siRNA or the RISC complex could harmonize the two
apparently conﬂicting properties of siRNAs.
Due to utmost importance of siRNA speciﬁcity in
siRNA drug development and the need for generating
allele-speciﬁc siRNAs, we have created an experimental
system to generate insight of siRNA discrimination of
mismatched target sites. Using more than 400 reporter
plasmids for 20 siRNAs we have revealed a general
rule for mismatch tolerance and discrimination. Using
this discovery as a guideline, we have constructed the
ﬁrst model of mismatch-tagged, position-speciﬁc discrim-
ination of closely related target sites. The model was then
successfully used for designing allele-speciﬁc siRNA.

Plasmid DNAs were extracted using a mini-puriﬁcation
kit (Promega).
RNAi assay
Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 100U/ml
penicillin and 100mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies,
Gibco). The cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a
density of 1 105 cells/well one day before transfection.
siQuant vector (0.17 mg/well) carrying the target site of
tested siRNA was transfected into HEK293 cells at
approximately 50% conﬂuence, together with pRL-TK
control vector (0.017 mg/well), with or without the
siRNA (13 nM). The activity of both luciferases was deter-
mined by a ﬂuorometer (Synergy HT, BioTek, USA)
before the ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to
renilla luciferase for each well. Silencing eﬃcacy of each
siRNA was calculated by comparison with a sample
without siRNA treatment. All experiments were per-
formed in triplicate and repeated at least twice.
Northern blot assay
Twenty-four hours after transfection with siQuant vector
and siRNA, total RNA was harvested from HEK293 cells
with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Total RNA (10–20 mg) was
separated by electrophoresis in an ethidium bromide-
containing agarose–formaldehyde gel. The intensities of
the 18S and 28S rRNA bands were checked under ultra-
violet light to verify that all samples were loaded equally
and that no RNA degradation had occurred. The
DNA probe was labeled with biotin-dUTP using the
Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega). Hybridization
and stringent washing were performed according to
ExpressHy (Clontech), and the signals were detected by
Streptavidin IRDye 800CW on an Odyssey infrared
imaging system (LI-COR).
Spectroscopy
UV-Vis melting curves (absorbance versus temperature
proﬁle) of RNA duplexes were collected by a Varian
Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian,
USA) with a cell of 1.0 cm path length. 0.2 OD RNA
duplex was used for each measurement. Prior to the
measurements, RNA duplexes were denatured and
annealed by heating to 90C for 5min and slowly
cooling to 4C overnight. The absorbance was measured
at 260 nm from 20 to 90C with a heating rate of 0.5C per
minute in RNase-free buﬀer (10mM phosphate buﬀer,
100mM NaCl and 0.1mM EDTA, pH 7). Melting tem-
perature was calculated using the Carry WinUV software
package.
Circular dichroism spectra
The circular dichroism (CD) spectrums were measured
from 320 to 200 nm at 25C using a JASCO J-810
spectropolarimeter (AVIV, USA), with a 0.1 cm path
length cuvette. 0.2 OD RNA duplex in RNase-free
buﬀer (10 mM phosphate buﬀer, 100mM NaCl and
0.1mM EDTA, pH 7) was used in each measurement.
For each RNA duplex, three independent measurements
were made.
Computational modeling of the secondary structure
of RNA duplexes
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed
using the Sander module of the AMBER8 program.
The RNA molecule was neutralized by Na+ counter
ions at 37C (placed according to xLEaP at favorable
electrostatic potential points), surrounded by an 8 A˚
TIP3P periodic water box. Optimization and MD simula-
tion were performed according to the following procedure:
(i) 1000 steps of initial energy minimization with solvate
and ions, holding RNA structure ﬁxed; (ii) 2500 steps of
restrained energy minimization (no restraints for the min-
imization of the wild-type RNA structure); cis-Watson–
Crick base pairing hydrogen bonds were used as
constrains for the optimization; (iii) 20 ps molecular
dynamics simulation by heating the whole system from 0
to 300K, while keeping the RNA molecule ﬁxed with
weak restraints; and (iv) molecular dynamics equilibration
with a time step of 2 fs at 300K until the RMSD curves
became stable.
RESULTS
Position-dependent mismatch discrimination
pattern of siRNA
Using a previously established gene silencing assay (16),
a siRNA target fragment, perfectly matched or single
nucleotide mismatched relative to the siRNA guide
strand, was fused in-frame with the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene
in a mammalian expression vector. The resulting fusion
reporter was then used as an artiﬁcial target to evaluate
the silencing eﬃcacy of the siRNA on the target. In the
present study, target mutations were initially made at
three positions, selected from target regions of diﬀering
mutation sensitivity (9,15). In total, twenty eﬀective
siRNAs were examined for their silencing eﬃcacy on 200
matched or single nucleotide mismatched targets, covering
all such mismatches at these positions (Supplementary
Data S1). The mismatch formed between the siRNA
guide strand and the mutant target is indicated by X:Y,
where X stands for the nucleotide in the guide strand and
Y stands for the opposite nucleotide in the target.
Surprisingly, when the silencing eﬃcacies were aligned
in terms of the position and the identity of the mismatched
nucleotide in the siRNA guide strand, consistent discrim-
ination proﬁles were found in each subgroup (Figure 1,
measurement variances in Supplementary Data S2). For
example, in the case of four siRNAs having adenine at
position 17 of the guide strand (Figure 1, upper left
panel), mutation of the target nucleotide from U to C
led to an A:C mismatch between the guide strand and
the target. Compared with other mutations, mutation
from U to C caused the least loss of silencing eﬃcacy
for all four siRNAs, while mutation from U to G
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 22 7561
(forming an A:G mismatch) resulted in the most signiﬁ-
cant loss of silencing activity. Therefore, for siRNAs
having adenine at this position, the tolerance order was
C>A>G; for siRNAs with cytosine at this position, the
order was A>U>C; and for siRNAs with uracil, the
order was U>C>G.
When mutations were made on the target nucleotide
opposite to position 12 of the guide strand, the tolerance
order was A>C=G for adenine, A>U>C for cytosine,
G>C=U for uracil, and A>U>G for guanine in the
guide strand. Unlike position 17, which is located in
a region of low sensitivity, position 12 is in a region
of high sensitivity approximating the cleavage site.
Accordingly, relatively low tolerance was found at this
position.
Position 4 was selected from the seed region of the
siRNA guide strand; this position is implicated in oﬀ-
target gene silencing mediated by translation repression
(9,10). When mutations were made here, the tolerance
order was A>C=G for A in the guide strand,
A>U>C for C in the guide strand, U>G=C for U
in the guide strand, and U>A=G for G in the guide
strand.
From the layered gene silencing eﬃcacy at these
positions, several revealing observations were made.
First, a unique tolerance proﬁle was identiﬁed at each
tested position, demonstrating signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
the gene silencing of the most tolerant and the less
tolerant target mutations (Supplementary Data S3). For
example at position 12, the A:A mismatch had virtually no
eﬀect on the silencing eﬃcacy of all ﬁve siRNAs having
adenine, however, the same mismatch signiﬁcantly
compromised gene silencing of the four siRNAs with
adenine at position 17 (15% reduction on average).
Second, dramatically diﬀerent tolerance levels occurred
if mismatched nucleotides were swapped between the
guide strand and the target. For example at position 17,
both A:C and C:A mismatches were well tolerated and
mediated strong gene silencing; equivalent tolerance did
not occur at position 12. While an A:C mismatch at
position 12 was largely tolerated (11% reduction on
average), silencing eﬃcacy of the siRNAs was signiﬁcantly
compromised by a C:A mismatch (25% reduction on
average). In addition, tolerance of the U:G wobble base
pair was not as great as that of the G:U wobble base pair
in general. Third, the order of position-speciﬁc tolerance
was independent of the sequence context of the siRNA or
the target.
To rule out potential bias due to the cell type used in the
assay, the experiments were repeated with Hela cells,

Figure 1. Mismatch discrimination pattern at three positions. Gene silencing tolerance of single point target mutations was studied by examining
the silencing eﬃcacies of 20 siRNAs on their perfectly matched or single nucleotide mismatched targets at three guide positions—4, 12 and 17.
The silencing eﬃcacies were aligned in terms of position and then the identity of the mismatched nucleotide in the siRNA guide strand. Horizontal

revealing similar tolerance proﬁles. Together, these data
demonstrated that the tolerance proﬁles are a common
property of RNAi processing.
Building a general model of single nucleotide mismatch
discrimination proﬁle of siRNA
Taking into consideration of its potential signiﬁcance in
allele-speciﬁc siRNA design, other target positions were
further examined. For each given identity of the
nucleotide on a target position, at least two siRNAs
were examined using the same experimental setting.
The resulting gene silencing data were aligned accordingly
(Figure 2, Supplementary Data S4). As expected, a unique
discrimination proﬁle was found at individual positions
across the whole target site, demonstrating the generality
of the mismatch discrimination in RNA interference.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the most compre-
hensive data set regarding single point target mutations to
date. The most striking ﬁnding was that, depending on the
nucleotide in the siRNA guide strand, a most tolerant and
a least tolerant mismatch, as well as a few most sensitive
Figure 2. The mismatch discrimination proﬁle across the whole target positions. A general discrimination proﬁle was presented in logo according to
the nucleotide in siRNA guide strand: (A) adenine; (B) guanine; (C) uracil; (D) cytosine. Mismatches formed between the guide strand and single-
nucleotide mismatched targets were represented by the symbols of the mismatched target nucleotide. The height of the symbol was made pro-
portional to the average ratio that was calculated by normalizing the remaining luciferase activity of mismatched target to perfectly matched
counterpart, indicating the extent of interference with gene silencing. Larger size of the symbol indicates greater interference and less tolerance of
the mismatched target. At each position, the symbols were sorted in terms of height from bottom to top, and the overall height of the symbols
indicates the discrimination property of the position.

positions occurred. Given A in the guide strand, the most
tolerant mismatch was the A:C (purine:pyrimidine)
mismatch that resulted in 69% reduction of reporter
gene activity on average, and the least tolerant mismatch
was A:G (purine:purine, 52% reduction on average).
The most sensitive positions were 9, 10, 12, 14 and 15
(Figure 2A). For G in the guide strand, the most
tolerant mismatch was G:U (purine:pyrimidine, 72%
reduction) and the least tolerant was G:G (purine:purine,
64% reduction); the most sensitive positions were 8–13
(Figure 2B). For U in the guide strand, the most
tolerant mismatch was U:G (purine:pyrimidine, 62%
reduction) or U:U (pyrimidine:pyrimidine, 62% reduc-
tion) and the least tolerant was U:C (pyrimidine:
pyrimidine, 49% reduction); the most sensitive positions
were 9, 11–13 and 15–16 (Figure 2C). For C in the
guide strand, the most tolerant mismatch was C :A
(purine : pyrimidine, 80% reduction) and the least
tolerant was C :C (pyrimidine:pyrimidine, 62% reduc-
tion); the most sensitive positions were 10–13 and 16
(Figure 2D). In general, purine:pyrimidine mismatches
were more tolerated than purine:purine or pyrimidine:
pyrimidine mismatches. Other interesting observations
included: (i) distinct sensitivity proﬁles were found
depending on the nucleotide in the siRNA guide strand.
The mismatches formed by G were generally more
tolerated than mismatches formed by A in the guide
strand (Figure 2A and B). (ii) In contrast to previous
suggestions that perfectly complementary around the
cleavage site is required in RNAi (17–20), our data
showed that these were not always the most sensitive
positions. For example, mismatches at position 10
were much more tolerated than at positions 9 and 11
(Figure 2C). (iii) Generally low sensitivity was found in
the seed region of the siRNA guide strand.
To investigate the nature of the silencing in our study,
northern blot assay was performed. The results showed
that the amount of mutated target transcript was
signiﬁcantly reduced by the introduction of the siRNA,
indicating that the gene silencing was mediated by target
cleavage rather than translational repression (Figure 3A).
Furthermore, mRNA quantiﬁcation by northern blot
perfectly matched the gene silencing eﬃcacy measured
by luciferase activity (Figure 3B).
Rational design of allele-speciﬁc siRNA using the
mismatch discrimination model as a guide
The remarkable discrimination proﬁle revealed in our
studies indicated that, for a given mismatch, some
positions are more sensitive (less tolerant) than others. If
a mismatch was placed at its most sensitive position, selec-
tive gene silencing between the perfectly matched and the
single nucleotide mismatched target could be achieved.

Figure 3. Silencing of single point mismatched target is mediated by target cleavage. Northern blot was performed with mRNA transcripts harboring
perfectly matched or single nucleotide mismatched target sites of siRNA-4. Reporter plasmids mutated at positions 12 and 10 were co-transfected
into cells with (+) or without () the siRNA, and then the amount of reporter mRNA was evaluated using ﬂuorophore-labeled probe. (A) siRNA
treatment markedly decreased the fusion gene mRNA level relative to the control without siRNA. 18s rRNA was included as loading control.

This discrimination is of great value to the silencing of
SNP disease alleles, in which a siRNA that is designed
to perfectly match the mutant allele will also pair
imperfectly with the wild-type allele, and form a single
nucleotide mismatch between them. By placing the
mismatch in its most sensitive positions (Table 1), the
siRNA might mediate eﬀective silencing of the mutant
allele, while oﬀ-target silencing of the wild-type allele is
minimized.
To establish proof of concept, single nucleotide
mutated alleles of the PIK3CA (phosphoinositide-3-
kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide) gene were further
studied. PIK3CA encodes the p110a catalytic subunit
that regulates essential signaling pathways important for
neoplasia (21,22). This gene is frequently mutated in
human tumors in the form of a single point mutation,
thus providing us with a model system to evaluate the
selective gene silencing strategy (23). The two most
frequent SNP sites derived from human tumor samples
were selected for study: one causes a G to A transition
(mutation 1633), and the other an A to G transition
(mutation 3140). Based on our earlier data, four allele-
speciﬁc siRNAs were designed to target mutation 1633
and three were designed to target mutation 3140, placing
the mismatched nucleotide at their most sensitive positions
in the siRNA guide strand (Figure 4A). To evaluate the
selective gene silencing, fusion reporter genes carrying
wild-type or mutant target were made as described
above. Cell assays successfully identiﬁed three allele-
speciﬁc siRNAs against mutation 1633 (1633-10, 13, 16)
and one against mutation 3140 (3140-11) (Figure 4B
and C). While pronounced gene silencing occurred with
perfectly matched mutant alleles, silencing of mismatched
wild-type alleles was insigniﬁcant, displaying high selectiv-
ity in allele-speciﬁc gene silencing. The discrimination was
further observed over siRNA concentrations from 0.02 to
80 nM, indicating that it is not a concentration-dependent
phenomenon (Figure 4D and E).
Duplex conformation change is correlated with mismatch
discrimination
In light of a recent study showing that a mismatch
between the siRNA guide strand and the target RNA
strand causes marked structural change and distorts its
helix conformation (24–26), we quantitatively investigated
two crucial features of the siRNA-target duplex, helix
conformation and thermodynamic stability. Studies were
performed with duplex RNAs formed by the guide strand
of siRNA-604 and its matched, or single nucleotide mis-
matched targets, at position 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 or 17
(Supplementary Data S5). At these positions, the perfectly
matched duplexes, the most tolerant duplexes (A:C or
C:A), as well as the least tolerant duplexes (A:A or C:C)
were examined.
To quantify the conformational distortion caused
by the mismatches, an experimental CD spectrum assay
and computing-based MD simulations were performed.
Consistent with previous studies (25,26), a distorted
helix conformation was observed in mismatched duplexes
when compared with perfectly matched counterparts
(Figure 5B). More importantly, matched patterns were
revealed between the silencing eﬃcacies and the
deviations in negative Cotton values of the CD spectra
exhibiting conformational distortion of the helix structure
(Figure 5A and B). This ﬁnding was further corroborated
by MD simulations (Figure 6), suggesting a correlation
between the compromised gene silencing and the degree
of conformational distortion. Taken together, our data
indicated that greater conformational distortion caused
more interference with gene silencing activity, thus provid-
ing an explanation of why some target mutations are more
tolerated than the others.
Besides conformational change, the inﬂuence on the
thermodynamic stability of the RNA duplexes was also
examined in terms of melting temperature. It was interest-
ing to note that changes in melting temperature correlated
with the positions but not the identities of the mismatches
(Figure 5A and C). For example, at position 15, A :A and
A :C mismatches had little eﬀect on melting temperature
compared with the wild-type counterpart. The silencing
eﬃcacy of the A :A mismatch was, however, decreased
by a signiﬁcant 72%, while the silencing of the A :C
mismatch was decreased by only 9%. The apparent incon-
sistency between the changes of melting temperature and
gene silencing eﬃcacies indicated that the perturbed
thermodynamic stability of the duplex does not account
for the compromised gene silencing.
DISCUSSION
In allele-speciﬁc gene therapy, speciﬁcally designed
siRNAs are expected to selectively reduce the expression
of disease-causing alleles without aﬀecting the expression
of their wild-type counterparts. To achieve this goal, we
performed a large-scale RNAi assay to understand the
role of target mutation in oﬀ-target gene silencing. The
results demonstrated a position-speciﬁc discrimination
proﬁle across the whole target site, and in particular,
identiﬁed the most tolerant and the most disruptive
single point target mutation at each target position.
Furthermore, for any given mismatch between siRNA
guide strand and target RNA, the study identiﬁed the
most sensitive positions for a single point target

mutation, therefore establishing a solid basis for allele-
speciﬁc siRNA design.
A consistent tolerance preference was observed for the
same mismatch when it was at the same position in the
target site, indicating that processing of similarly mis-
matched substrate duplexes at the same location within
the Ago protein likely results in comparable interference
with its functionality. In contrast, when the same
mismatch was at diﬀerent target positions, distinct toler-
ance preferences were found. This indicated that process-
ing of similarly mismatched duplexes at diﬀerent locations
within the protein resulted in distinct levels of interference

Figure 4. Potent and selective silencing of SNP disease alleles. (A) Four siRNAs were designed to target the disease-causing allele at position 1633 of
the PIK3CA gene, and three siRNAs were designed to target the disease allele at position 3140. (B, C) RNAi assays performed with fusion luciferase
reporter having wild-type or target mutation at position 1633 and 3140. (D, E) RNAi assays performed with siRNA 1633-10, 16 over a series of
siRNA concentrations.

with its functionality. In search of the mechanism involved
in the discriminative gene silencing against diﬀerently
mutated targets, quantitative assays were performed on
siRNA-target duplexes, with the focus on the inﬂuence
on duplex conformation and thermodynamic stability. In
agreement with previous studies (25,26), our data showed
that mismatch between siRNA guide strand and target
RNA caused a marked change in the normal helix
structure. Furthermore, our data indicated that the
tolerant mismatches caused less structural distortion
than the disruptive mismatches, which explains why
some mutations were more tolerated than others.
Collectively, these lines of evidence led us to speculate
that, depending on its position and identity, a mismatch
formed between the siRNA guide strand and the target
RNA might introduce a conformational change in the

Figure 5. Correlation between gene silencing eﬃcacy and CD spectra or thermodynamic stability. Mismatch-derived alteration of conformational
distortion or duplex thermodynamic stability was examined using RNA duplexes formed by the guide strand of siRNA-604 and matched or single
nucleotide mismatched targets. Conformational distortion of the RNA duplex was evaluated by measuring CD spectra (B), and the thermodynamic
stability was evaluated by melting temperature (C). For comparison, the gene silencing eﬃcacy of the respective target is shown in (A). Mismatched
position in siRNA guide strand and base-pairing type are indicated on the horizontal axis.

siRNA-target duplex, which in turn interferes with the
functionality of the Ago protein in oﬀ-target gene
silencing. The inﬂuence on Ago function is determined
by the level of the conformational change caused by the
target mutation.
As a major potential application of therapeutic siRNAs,
allele-speciﬁc gene therapy has received increasing atten-
tion in recent years. Among the 2.6 million SNP
polymorphisms characterized in the human genome, the
proportions of the substitutions are A/G, 32.77%; C/T,
32.81%; A/C, 8.98%; G/T, 9.06%; A/T, 7.46%; and C/G,
8.92. Around 65% of SNPs occur between the two purines
(A or G) or the two pyrimidines (C or T), which were thus
named transition substitutions (27). Targeting these
abundant SNP alleles raised a serious challenge to
siRNA design. For example, to silence a disease-causing
mutation from wild-type A to G, siRNA designed against
the mutant G allele has a C in the guide strand. When this
siRNA interacts with the wild-type A allele, a C:A
mismatch is formed between them. As revealed in our
study, the C:A mismatch is well tolerated in the processing
of RNAi and causes minimal interference with gene
silencing eﬃcacy. To confront this challenge, a G!A
and an A!G transition mutation were chosen to test in
our study. By placing the mismatches in their most sensi-
tive positions, as identiﬁed in the study, the speciﬁcally
designed siRNA showed great discrimination against
these two alleles, indicating that the principle proposed
here is generally applicable to allele-speciﬁc gene silencing.
