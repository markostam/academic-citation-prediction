[1] Using precipitation and temperature data for the 20th century in combination with a
macroscale hydrologic model, we evaluate changes in flood risk in the western U.S.
associated both with century-scale warming and interannual climate variations. In
addition, we examine the implications of apparent increases in precipitation variability
over the region since the mid-1970s. We use detrended temperature data representing
early and late 20th century climate to force the variable infiltration capacity
hydrologic model and show that spatially homogeneous temperature changes over the
western U.S. in the 20th century on the order of +1C per century have resulted in
substantial changes in flood risks over much of the region. Although changes specific to
particular geographic areas are apparent in some cases, the overall changes due to
observed warming trends are well categorized by midwinter temperature regimes in each
watershed. Cold river basins where snow processes dominate the annual hydrologic
cycle (<6C average in midwinter) typically show reductions in flood risk due to overall
reductions in spring snowpack. Relatively warm rain-dominant basins (>5C average
in midwinter) show little systematic change. Intermediate or transient basins show a
wide range of effects depending on competing factors such as the relative role of
antecedent snow and contributing basin area during storms that cause flooding. Warmer
transient basins along the coast in Washington, Oregon, and California, in particular,
tend to show increased flood risk. While the absolute value of simulated changes in flood
risk is affected by basin scale, the nature of the relationship of flood risk to basin
temperatures in midwinter is largely scale-independent. Climate variations associated
with Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
also have strong effects on flood risks. In contrast to the effects associated with
20th century warming, the climate variability signal is characterized by regional scale
patterns related to the geographic distribution of cool season precipitation also identified
in many previous studies. In general, the largest changes in simulated flood risks are
associated with years when PDO and ENSO are ‘‘in phase,’’ particularly in the southwest.
Changes in the variability of cool season precipitation after about 1973, the causes
of which are uncertain, are shown to result in increased flood risk over much of
the western U.S. in the simulations.

1. Introduction
[2] Despite the fact that probability distributions of annual
flood maxima are frequently assumed to be homogeneous in
time for engineering design purposes, there is now an
awareness that flood probability distributions are in fact a
complex function of climatic variations over a range of
timescales [Franks and Kuczera, 2002; Kiem et al., 2003;
Sankarasubramanian and Lall, 2003;Webb and Betancourt,
1992]. Furthermore, land use change due to anthropogenic or
natural causes such as urbanization, logging, fires, and
anthropogenic or natural changes in channel structure is
known to change flood risk [e.g., Bowling et al., 2000; Jain
and Lall, 2001; Matheussen et al., 2000; Wissmar et al.,
2004]. Such changes can be important to decision processes
that are affected by flood risks. One example of federal policy
in the U.S. that is affected by changing flood risks is the
Federal Emergency Management Administration flood in-
surance program, eligibility for which is usually based on
100-year return period flood inundation maps. These risks,
and hence maps used for land use planning, are now consid-
ered static, but such assumptions may not be realistic. If they
are not, important questions are raised about how such
programs should be designed and managed to cope with
nonstationary insurance risks.
[3] In this paper, we focus on the role of climatic
variations in determining flood risks associated with natural

flow in watersheds in the western U.S. There is a steadily
growing body of research that has demonstrated that
climatic variations in the western U.S. are predictable
over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales [Dettinger
et al., 1998; Gershunov and Barnett, 1998; Hamlet and
Lettenmaier, 2000;Mote et al., 2003; Sheppard et al., 2002].
Regional scale variations in winter climate associated with
the El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation (ENSO [Battisti and
Sarachik, 1995]) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
(PDO [Mantua et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1997]), for
example, have been shown to influence variations in sea-
sonal flow in western rivers [e.g., Hamlet and Lettenmaier,
1999; Hidalgo and Dracup, 2003; Redmond and Koch,
1991]. The effects of ENSO and PDO on cool season
precipitation in the western U.S. are frequently character-
ized as a northwest/southwest precipitation dipole influ-
enced primarily by storm track behavior [Gershunov and
Barnett, 1998]. In warm phase ENSO or PDO years, for
example, the Pacific Northwest (PNW) is typically warmer
and dryer than normal in cool season, and cool season
precipitation in the southwestern U.S. is typically average to
above average. In cool phase ENSO or PDO years, the
pattern is essentially reversed, with cooler and wetter con-
ditions typical in the PNW and a heightened risk of drought
in the Southwest. There is also evidence that ENSO and
PDO can ‘‘reinforce’’ each other; that is, when ENSO and
PDO are ‘‘in phase’’ (i.e., both in warm phase or both in
cool phase), the effects on cool season precipitation are
enhanced, whereas when they are ‘‘out of phase,’’ the
effects are diminished [Gershunov and Barnett, 1998]. In
some areas of the western U.S., there is little apparent
relationship between ENSO and precipitation variability
(Table 4).
[4] Variations in cool season climate associated with
ENSO and PDO that affect streamflow variability can play
an important role in determining variations in flood risks for
different periods in the historic record (for example, cool
versus warm PDO epochs) or in specific classes of years
(for example, warm ENSO or PDO years) on an interannual
basis. Because long-range (3–9 months lead time) forecasts
of midwinter PDO and ENSO conditions are available,
understanding the relationships between these predictable
climate indices and flood risks may also have important
implications for water management (or other) decision
processes affected by changes in flood risk. Adjustments
of flood control rule curves used to operate storage reser-
voirs, for example, could reflect different levels of flood risk
in different years.
[5] Systematic shifts in temperature associated with global
warming are also a potentially important concern in the
context of flooding. In the western U.S., increasing temper-
atures in the 20th century (Figure 1) have already had
profound effects on both peak snow water equivalent and
the timing of melting snow in spring [Mote et al., 2005;
Hamlet et al., 2005]. These changes in snowpack have also
affected the timing of runoff [Stewart et al., 2005; Hamlet et
al., 2006] and (as inferred from modeling studies) soil
moisture recharge [Hamlet et al., 2006], effects which also
have the potential to alter the probability distributions of
floods.
[6] In this study, we seek to understand and quantify the
effects of 20th century warming and interannual and inter-
decadal variations in winter climate on flood risks across
the western U.S., which we define as the U.S. west of
the Continental Divide, and the Canadian portion of the
Columbia River basin in British Columbia. For purposes of
discussion, we have also divided this larger domain into
four subdomains: the PNW, which comprises the Columbia
River basin and coastal drainages; California (CA), which
comprises rivers within the Sacramento and San Joaquin
basin; the Great Basin (GB); and the Colorado River basin
(CRB; Figure 1). We will also demonstrate that the effects
of 20th century warming and interannual and interdecadal
variations in winter climate on western U.S. flooding are
linked because a general warming also affects interannual
variations in river discharge. To avoid potentially confusing
interactions between these two mechanisms in the observed
climatic record, we develop methods to isolate the sensi-
tivity to these two effects in the subsequent analysis.
2. 20th Century Climate Variations in the
Western U.S.
[7] In two companion studies, Hamlet et al. [2006] and
Mote et al. [2005] have examined trends in cool and warm
season precipitation and temperature over the same western
U.S. domain using both observations from the Historical
Climatology Network [Karl et al., 1990] and the same daily
time step, gridded meteorological data used here (see
following sections for more details on the meteorological
driving data set). Cool and warm season trends in the
gridded data set are summarized in tabular form by Hamlet
et al. [2006], and monthly trends in daily maximum (Tmax)
and minimum (Tmin) temperatures for each region are
shown in Figure 2. We summarize below some of the key
findings from the earlier papers that have a direct bearing on
the hypotheses and experimental design of this study.
[8] To begin with, there are fundamental differences
between variations in precipitation and temperature over
the 20th century that are important in the context of this
study. From 1916 to 2003, essentially the entire western
U.S. has experienced increases in both cool season and
warm season temperatures [Mote et al., 2005; Hamlet et al.,
2006]. The rate of change varies from location to location
and with the time period examined, but the central tendency
is on the order of 1C per century from 1916 to 2003
[Hamlet et al., 2006]. The rate of increase from 1947 to
2003 is roughly double that of the longer period from 1916
to 2003, which is largely attributable to the fact that much of
the observed warming has occurred from about 1975 to
present. Figure 2 also shows that the largest trends in
temperature are focused in January-March, which has im-
portant implications for hydrologic effects related to
changes in snow. Although these regional scale changes
may or may not be directly attributable to global warming,
the synchronicity and spatial extent of these changes and the
similarity to the changes that have occurred over the globe
(and the Northern Hemisphere) over the same time period
(not shown) strongly suggest a consistent large-scale cli-
matic influence affecting the entire western U.S.
[9] The nature of cool season precipitation variations in
the western U.S. over the period 1916–2003 contrasts with
the observed temperature changes. Over this period, there is
little evidence of any consistent large-scale trends. Instead,
precipitation variations seem to be most strongly related to

natural variations at decadal timescales in particular regions
[Cayan et al., 1998; Mote et al., 2005; Hamlet et al., 2006].
To illustrate this point, a comparison between the CRB
and the PNW is instructive. Figure 1 shows that the West
as a whole was relatively dry from 1925 to 1946 and
remained dry in the CRB from 1947 to 1976 after which
there was an abrupt shift to wetter conditions from 1977
onward [Hidalgo and Dracup, 2003]. In the PNW, however,
the period from 1947 to 1976 was anomalously wet,
whereas the period from 1977 to at least the mid-1990s
was generally dry. Thus trends in precipitation across the
West have been generally upward since the early part of the
century (owing primarily to large-scale drought in the early
part of the record) but are opposite in sign for the PNW and
the CRB in the last half century or so when global warming
arguably had its strongest influence [Mote et al., 2005;
Hamlet et al., 2006]. These historic patterns suggest that
global warming has (at least so far) played a relatively
minor role in determining cool season precipitation trends.
[10] A lack of robust trends in cool season precipitation
notwithstanding, there is an obvious change in the interan-
nual variability of cool season precipitation across the West
after about 1973 (Figure 1, top right panel). This altered
variability is characterized by increased variance, increased
autocorrelation in time (increased temporal persistence), and
increased synchronicity between the different regions of the
western U.S. There is currently little conclusive evidence to
tie these changes in variability to global warming per se;
however, the synchronicity and spatial extent of these
effects again suggest a large-scale climatic influence affec-
ting the western U.S. as a whole. This increased synchro-
nicity and variance has also been noted in several other
studies examining observed streamflow records [e.g., Cayan
et al., 2003; Jain et al., 2005; Pagano and Garen, 2005].

[11] These findings have important implications for
investigations of evolving flood risks in the western U.S.,
which are potentially affected by both temperature and
precipitation changes at various timescales (see discussion
of mechanisms in following section). Because the region is
apparently systematically warmer now than it was in the
past, one objective of this study is to understand what the
resulting implications have been for flood risks. We will
also examine the changes in flood risks associated with
interannual climate variations associated with PDO and
ENSO, as well as for the apparent changes in precipitation
variability that have occurred since the mid-1970s.
3. Physical Mechanisms Associated With Western
U.S. Flooding
[12] At the most fundamental level, flooding is caused by
complex interactions between storm characteristics (season-
ality of storms, precipitation intensity, storm size and
duration, temperature, orientation, and velocity), catchment
geometry (basin area, slope, orientation), land surface
characteristics (infiltration rate, depth of soils, vegetation),
and antecedent hydrologic conditions (soil moisture, snow-
pack) [Pilgrim and Cordery, 1993]. For many rivers of
moderate-to-large spatial scale in the western U.S., floods
typically result from either (1) large-scale fall and winter
storms or (2) spring snowmelt, both of which are associated
with relatively large-scale climatic drivers [O’Conner and
Costa, 2003]. In section 4, we also compare the seasonality
of flooding for both model simulations and observations,
which provides additional evidence that winter and spring
flooding are the general rule in the western U.S. for basins
larger than about 775 km2 (Figure 2). These general
characteristics are in contrast to flooding that occurs at
smaller spatial scales in the arid southwestern U.S. and in
other regions of the U.S., where warm-season thunder-
storms affecting relatively small spatial scales are some-
times responsible for extreme flash flooding (for example,
the 1997 flood at Ft. Collins, CO, and the 1972 flood at
Rapid City, IA).
[13] On this basis, we argue that, at least for the moderate-
to-large river basins in the western U.S. that we will

examine in this study, the causes of flooding associated with
catchment geometry and storm size interactions are proba-
bly less important than in other regions, and large-scale
effects due to cool season climate play a more important
role. This is particularly true in larger snowmelt-dominant
rivers where spring snowmelt flooding is often related to the
spatially and temporally integrated climatic effects occur-
ring during the entire snow accumulation season (typically
November to March) rather than to individual winter storms
[O’Conner and Costa, 2003].
[14] For a given temperature regime, increases in precip-
itation intensity or duration at the time when floods typi-
cally occur would generally be expected to increase flood
risks [Pilgrim and Cordery, 1993]; however, the sensitivity
of flooding to temperature variations (for example, because
of decreased snowpack, changes in contributing basin area,
and evaporation) is potentially different for basins with
different winter temperature regimes.
[15] In rain-dominant basins that are mostly above free-
zing in winter, floods are mostly associated with storms that
produce (1) extreme precipitation intensity or (2) heavy
precipitation over a longer duration and/or a large spatial
scale. The amount of runoff produced by either kind of
storm can be intensified by antecedent conditions that
produce saturated soils [Pilgrim and Cordery, 1993]. In
these basins, one might expect that systematic shifts in
temperature would play a relatively minor role in changing
flood risks because floods are determined primarily by the
characteristics of observed storms. Basins of this type are
typically in areas near the Pacific coast or in low elevation
areas on the western slopes of near-coastal mountain ranges
such as the Cascades in Washington (WA) and Oregon (OR)
and the northern Sierra in California (CA).
[16] In mountain watersheds where average midwinter
temperatures are close to freezing (which we will refer to as
‘‘transient snow’’ watersheds), temperature can play an
important role in determining the amount of runoff that will
occur in response to a given storm. This is particularly true
in places where cool season storms are large enough in
spatial extent that a large portion of the basin is affected by
individual storms, with temperature controlling the contrib-
uting basin area via the form (rain or snow) of the
precipitation over different parts of the basin. In near coastal
mountain watersheds in WA, for example, warm winter
storms (for example, ‘‘pineapple express’’ storms) can
produce an unusually large amount of runoff simply be-
cause the entire watershed is below the snowline [U.S.
Geological Survey Fact Sheet (USGS FS) 228-96, What
Causes Floods in Washington State, http://wa.water.usgs.
gov/projects/pugethazards/urbanhaz/PDF/FS_228-96.pdf].
A similar amount of precipitation occurring in combination
with colder conditions can have a much smaller contributing
basin area, with areas of the basin at higher elevation
accumulating snowpack rather than producing runoff. An-
tecedent snowpack can also melt during warm events,
adding additional runoff to that generated by new precipi-
tation (so-called ‘‘rain on snow’’ floods; USGS FS 228-96).
Thus several competing mechanisms present themselves
with regard to changes in flooding in response to systematic
warming in transient snow watersheds. Storms occurring in
early winter, for example, would be associated with signif-
icant antecedent snow less frequently and/or over a smaller
portion of the drainage area in a warmer climate, but the
effective basin area could be larger. In response to warming,
flood risks could potentially increase or decrease depending
on the relative importance of these two factors. Transient
watersheds are typically found in moderate to high elevation
areas of near coastal mountain ranges in WA, OR, and CA,
and at lower elevations in colder inland areas.
[17] In snowmelt-dominant watersheds, for which mid-
winter temperatures are frequently well below freezing,
flooding typically occurs in spring when the accumulated
snowpack melts. The largest floods in these basins are
caused by unusually large snowpacks which either melt
rapidly because of warm temperatures or are combined with
additional precipitation falling as rain. Increasing temper-
atures have been shown to result in decreased spring snow
accumulation [Hamlet et al., 2005], which would suggest
decreased flood risks; however, earlier snowmelt and the
resulting earlier soil moisture recharge [Hamlet et al., 2006]
could also potentially increase flooding during some spring
storms. Snowmelt-dominant watersheds are typically found
at the highest elevations in near coastal mountain ranges and
at moderate to high elevations in inland areas with colder
winter climate.
4. Methods and Experimental Design
[18] As in the study by Hamlet et al. [2005], we use the
variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrologic model [Liang
et al., 1994], implemented at 1/8 latitude/longitude reso-
lution over the western U.S. Additional details on the model
implementation are given by Hamlet et al. [2005]. In this
study, we also make use of a daily time step streamflow
routing model described by Lohmann et al. [1998], which is
applied as a postprocessing step to daily time step runoff
and base flow calculated by the VIC model for each 1/8 grid
cell. The routing model uses a unit hydrograph approach at
the grid-cell scale, combined with a simple channel routing
scheme that accounts for lateral movement of water between
grid cells. The model does not include detailed information
about spatial variations in the unit hydrographs for each cell
or about the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel
system, but is appropriate for large-scale studies of this kind
where such details are not the central concern. Using this
modeling framework, we examine hydrologic effects of
climatic variability and change on natural streamflow, which
is defined as the streamflow that would occur in the absence
of anthropogenic effects such as water management and land
use change.
[19] At very large spatial scales (i.e., river basins with
drainage areas on the order of 104–105 km2), the VIC
model has been shown to reproduce naturalized monthly
streamflows for a number of basins across the western U.S.
with good fidelity [Maurer et al., 2002]. At smaller spatial
scales, the model typically displays more bias, although
monthly streamflow anomalies associated with climatic
variability are often well simulated when the model bias
is removed via statistical procedures [Voisin et al., 2006].
[20] Previous studies have also shown that the macroscale
changes in snowpack and runoff timing associated with
warming and changing precipitation regimes in the western
U.S. are well simulated by the model, despite bias at smaller
spatial scales [Mote et al., 2005; Hamlet et al., 2005, 2006].

The model is evaluated in the context of climatic effects on
flooding below.
4.1. Meteorological Driving Data
[21] We take as our starting place the gridded 1/8 spatial
resolution meteorological driving data set for the western
U.S. described by Hamlet and Lettenmaier [2005] and used
in previous studies to investigate hydrologic trends in the
region [Hamlet et al., 2005, 2006; Mote et al., 2005]. To
investigate the effects of 20th century warming on floods,
two variations of this daily temperature and precipitation
data set were constructed, each representing an identical
precipitation time series for a specific temperature regime
associated with early and late 20th century conditions. To
construct these detrended data sets, for each grid cell and
each calendar month, linear trends in the monthly average
of daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and daily minimum
temperatures (Tmin; see Figure 2 for a regional overview)
were removed from the time series relative to a specific
‘‘pivot year’’ as follows:
Tadj month½  year½  ¼ Torig month½  year½ 
þ Trend month½  * pivot year  yearð Þ
Thus for a positive trend in temperature, temperatures in
years before the pivot year were increased, whereas
temperatures in years after the pivot year were decreased.
After the monthly trend was removed, the original daily
data were scaled to recreate the adjusted monthly value
while retaining the time series elements of the daily
variations within the month. Thus the long-term trends in
Tmax and Tmin were removed, but the daily covariability
of temperature and precipitation was largely preserved as in
the historic record, and most of the statistics of the spatial,
seasonal, and interannual variability of temperature and
precipitation are also largely preserved in the adjusted data
sets. Note, however, that the trends in Tmax and Tmin were
adjusted separately for each month.
[22] This procedure was carried out for a pivot year of
1915 (i.e., to create a data set consistent with early 20th
century temperatures) and for a pivot year of 2003 (i.e., to
create a data set consistent with late 20th century temper-
atures). The advantage of using this approach is that a long
time series of precipitation and temperature, reflecting a
wide range of natural variations over the 20th century, can
be examined in the context of a consistent overall temper-
ature regime. Thus we can examine the effects of natural
variability that occurred early in the century for a temper-
ature regime consistent with the late 20th century and vice
versa. This also provides a large sample of observed storms
for evaluating in quantitative terms the effects of changing
temperature regimes on flood statistics.
[23] Climate categories (warm, neutral, cool) for interan-
nual ENSO and PDO variations were based on the NINO3.4
index of Trenberth [1997], the PDO index of Mantua et al.
[1997], and the definitions shown in Table 1.
[24] Note that we will examine the implications of inter-
annual variations in the PDO index (rather than an epochal
formulation) based on the analysis of Newman et al. [2003].
4.2. Flood Frequency Estimation
[25] For each river basin, and each of several daily
streamflow simulation time series (representing different
temperature regimes and/or composites based on climatic
categories), the annual maximum series (AMS, i.e., a time
series of the maximum daily flow in each water year) was
extracted. The generalized extreme value (GEV) probability
distribution was fit to each AMS using L-moment parameter
estimation techniques [Hosking and Wallis, 1993; Stedinger
et al., 1993]. Other parameter fitting techniques for the GEV
distribution were also tried using LH2 and LH4 moments
[Wang, 1997], and lognormal (LN) and extreme value type I
(EV I) distributions were also fitted to the data [Stedinger et
al., 1993]. The conclusions for this large-scale study were
not found to be sensitive to the choice of distribution or
fitting technique, and the GEV distribution using L-moment
parameter estimators was used throughout given that the
true probability distributions (and the nature of the changes
in these distributions) in each case are not known [Potter
and Lettenmaier, 1990]. Although a regional flood estima-
tion procedure could also potentially be used, we intention-
ally use at-site fits of the GEV because we are interested in
quantifying the effects of warming on basins with different
midwinter temperature regimes and in identifying the spatial
signature of PDO and ENSO variations, effects that would
potentially be masked by regional approaches.
[26] When fitting the probability distributions for flooding
associated with ENSO and PDO climate categories, and data
from 1973 to 2003, the AMS from each basin was first
composited according to the climate category (that is, flows
for years that do not match the climate category were
excluded), and the data were then processed exactly as for
the entire data set.
[27] Using the GEV parameters estimated in each case,
the 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-year return period floods were
calculated for each model forcing data set and climate
category. While the absolute value for each recurrence
interval is estimated, we are primarily interested in changes
in these quantities and will present the results as changes
relative to a base condition. This approach also avoids
issues associated with model bias, discussed below.
4.3. Model Evaluation
[28] As noted above, the VIC model has previously been
used to evaluate runoff mostly for relatively large river
basins at monthly timescales [e.g., Maurer et al., 2002]. In
this study, we fit distributions to the daily AMS for smaller
spatial scales (down to about 1700 km2). In this section, we
evaluate the ability of the model to capture the broad
behavior of flood regimes across the region using daily
streamflow data from the USGS Hydro-Climatic Data

Network (HCDN [Slack et al., 1993]): a set of stations with
long records that are nominally unaffected by diversions or
reservoir regulation. The test stations were selected based
on basin size [drainage area > 775 km2 (300 mi2)], the
availability of serially complete daily data for at least
50 years, and coincidence with the preexisting VIC stream
routing network. Eighty stations satisfying these criteria
were identified with records from water year (WY) 1953
to 2003. (Note that we extended the HCDN records, which
originally ended in 1988, through 2003 using current USGS
station records.) These gaging stations were then registered
with the VIC stream routing network, and VIC simulations
were made for a coincident location and time period using
observed temperature and precipitation data (without
temperature detrending). GEV probability distributions
were then fitted to the observed and simulated AMS as
described above. The mean annual flood (computed from
the AMS, rather than the fitted distribution) and the average
date of the annual maximum (daily) flow were also calcu-
lated for both observed and simulated data.
[29] To begin with, the model displayed considerable bias
in attempting to reproduce the mean annual flood in each
test basin. Many of the HCDN basins are fairly small in
size, which exacerbates errors in the spatial distribution of
precipitation in the gridded driving data sets, and even in
larger basins up to about 26,000 km2 (the largest in the test
data set), errors in the simulated mean annual flood (not
shown) were frequently on the order of 50%. From this
analysis, it was clear that for accurately estimating the
absolute value of annual daily peak flows in each individual
basin, the model and driving data sets were not suitable for
the intended analysis.
[30] Several aspects of the flood response in each basin
that are important to this study, however, were reasonably
well simulated. First, the model captured the seasonality of
flooding in each basin with reasonable fidelity in most of
the test basins (Figure 2, upper left). This is important in
the context of evaluating temperature-related impacts on
flooding regimes because the seasonal timing of flooding is
strongly related to temperature effects associated with snow
accumulation and contributing basin area in the western
U.S. Second, the model was able to produce representative
simulations of the ratio of the 100-year flood to the mean
annual flood (Figure 3, upper right and lower panels),

network from 1953 to 2003. Upper left: scatterplot of simulated versus observed average WY date of

demonstrating that once the bias in the simulated mean
annual flood was removed, the estimates of flood quantiles
from the fitted GEV distributions were reasonable in most
cases. To exploit the strengths of the model and to avoid the
issue of bias in the simulation of the mean annual flood, we
will report only the relative changes in flood quantiles
associated with various climatic drivers.
[31] The climate sensitivity of the model and probability
distribution fitting procedure was also examined by com-
positing the data from 1953 to 2003 in two ways. In the first
case (Figure 4, left panel), we composite the data for the
period from 1973 to 2003 (31 of 51 years) for both observed
and simulated data, fit GEV parameters, and estimate the
100-year event for each sample. The 100-year event for the
composited data was then compared to the 100-year event
for the unconditional sample (all data from 1953 to 2003)
for both VIC and HCDN observations. In the second case
(Figure 4, right panel), the same procedure is followed
except that data are composited for all warm ENSO years
from 1953 to 2003 (17 years of 51).
[32] The period from 1973 to 2003 is characterized both
by warmer temperatures and increased precipitation vari-
ability in comparison with the entire 1953–2003 period
(Figure 1). The model suggests that increases in flood risks
have occurred overall, and this is corroborated by the
observations (except for the PNW which shows a small
decrease in flood risk in the observations). Some biases
toward predictions of ‘‘false increases’’ (the lower right
quadrant of the figure) are also apparent. Regional scale
changes are simulated more accurately, however (colored
lines in Figure 4).
[33] In the case of the warm ENSO composite, the
smaller sample size results in a large increase in the absolute
errors. This is not representative of the sample sizes
available in the sensitivity analysis shown in following
sections (where both PDO and ENSO composites have
sample sizes of about 30), so the absolute errors shown are
probably not the primary concern. Climatic signals asso-
ciated with ENSO are broadly characterized by regional
scale redistributions of winter precipitation combined with
moderate temperature anomalies. On a station-by-station
basis, the model is not a very reliable predictor of changes
in flood risk associated with ENSO, especially for this
relatively small sample size. However, on a regional scale,
the model does better. For the PNW (red dots and lines in
Figure 4), a moderate shift toward lower flood risks is
apparent in both the observations and simulations. For CA
(blue dots and lines in Figure 3), flood risks are strongly
lower in warm ENSO years in both the observations and
simulations. In the CRB (green dots and lines in Figure 3),
the observations and simulations show little overall shift
in flood risks. Each of these effects is also broadly consistent
with the regional scale precipitation and streamflow signals
associated with warm ENSO discussed in section 1. Three
sites from the GB were included in the analysis, but regional
averages were omitted because of the small sample size.
[34] From the analysis described above, we conclude that
while the model has significant limitations for estimating
changes in flood risks in any particular basin, it is well
suited to identifying large-scale changes in flood risks
associated with climate variability, which is our primary
objective here. Such an analysis, while providing potentially
useful information about the changing nature of flood risks

on a regional basis, cannot be considered a replacement for
more detailed studies at the basin scale.
4.4. Test Basins
[35] Having evaluated the model using a limited observed
data set, we then constructed a larger set of test basins to
evaluate the sensitivity of flood risks to climate across the
region. Rather than select test basins according to specific
river locations (for example, USGS gaging sites), we
instead designed a large-scale sensitivity study in which
we used model simulations of the AMS for all drainage
basins within the region with drainage areas lying within
specified size ranges. In this way, we can examine the scale
dependence of the results while retaining a relatively large
sample size. This approach also has some advantages when
interpreting the effects of changing flood risks as a function
of midwinter basin temperature regimes because we can
show the effects over a wider range of conditions in a
consistent manner. The basin size ranges were selected
according to ranges of 1/8 cells shown in Table 2.
[36] The basins in each category were selected so that they
(1) fall within the range of cells and (2) are unique (in the
sense that the selected basins do not ‘‘nest’’ within any others
in the same size range). Because each basin is selected by
following the routing path downstream until the first basin
within the size range is found, in general, the location closest
to the lower bound of the category is selected first (and any
larger basin encompassing a previously selected basin are
ignored). For each basin, the unadjusted daily average

temperature from the VIC driving data set was summarized
for December, January, and February (DJF) for the period
1915–2003 and retained for use in subsequent categorization
of results.
[37] In a few isolated cases, the ‘‘flow’’ from a simulated
drainage network in the model does not represent a point in
a river channel. The largest drainage network in the GB, for
example, represents the combined drainages that feed the
Great Salt Lake, which is a closed basin. One could argue
that daily flood frequencies in these specific cases are
probably not the most appropriate metric for high flow
events, but for completeness, we nonetheless include these
combined drainages in the analysis.
5. Results and Discussion
[38] In the following sections, we present results from the
three model sensitivity studies showing the effects of
century-scale warming, retrospective PDO and ENSO var-
iability, and changes in cool season precipitation variability
since the mid-1970s on flood risks across the western U.S.
5.1. Effects of Century-Scale Warming
[39] In this section, we compare calculated flood risks
associated with the 2003 temperature regime with those
associated with the 1915 temperature regime and discuss the
dominant mechanisms that are responsible for the changes
in the different test basins. Figure 5 shows the changes in
the 20-year flood expressed as a ratio of the 2003 20-year
flood to the 1915 20-year flood for three different basin
sizes. Relationships for flood changes for the 100-year
return interval are similar (Figure 6). In the scatterplots,
the relationship between basin average DJF temperatures
(and color coding showing the month when flooding
typically occurs) and the ratio of flood quantiles is shown.
Table 3 summarizes the results for the four regions for four
DJF temperature ranges (see Figure 5, bottom left panel, for
reference).

[40] Basin DJF temperatures broadly categorize the
response to warming for different basins. For basins with
midwinter temperatures above 5C (i.e., rain dominant),
systematic changes in floods are relatively small and are
probably due to modest changes in antecedent soil moisture
conditions associated with temperature-related changes in
evaporation.
[41] For DJF temperatures below about 6C, flood risks
are mostly reduced by the observed warming. Most of these
basins are strongly snowmelt dominant and experience
annual peak flows in spring (usually in May or June). Flood
risks tend to decline in these basins because of systematic
reductions in spring snowpack. In a few basins, however,
the annual floods are shown to increase in magnitude
presumably because of a combination of elevated soil
moisture in the spring [Hamlet et al., 2006] and/or enlarged
contributing basin area during spring storms.
[42] For basins with moderate midwinter temperatures
between about 6C and 1C, a wide range of effects is
apparent, which are ultimately determined by complex
tradeoffs between antecedent snow conditions and the
effective basin area contributing to runoff from rainfall.
Consider a transient snow basin with midwinter temper-
atures close to freezing that typically experiences flooding
in February. In the 2003 climate, the basin will typically
have accumulated less snow in December and January than
in the 1915 climate, which would tend to reduce flood risk,
whereas in the 2003 climate, the contributing basin area also
will tend to be larger than in the 1915 climate. Depending
on the relative size of these two effects, the flood risk will
either increase or decrease. These mechanisms are broadly
consistent with the dependence of changes in the 20-year
flood on midwinter temperatures because the warmer basins
tend to have less antecedent snowpack than cooler basins.
That is, in warmer basins within this DJF temperature range,
the effect of basin enlargement dominates (increasing flood
risk), whereas in cooler basins, the reduction in antecedent
snow dominates (decreasing flood risk). The largest increases
in flood risk for this DJF temperature range are focused in
coastal areas of CA and the PNW, whereas basins in the CRB
and GB typically show decreases in flood risk (Figure 5 and
Table 3).
[43] Transient snow basins are also sensitive to the
seasonality of trends in temperature in each particular basin.
For example, in a hypothetical basin that typically floods in
January, if the warming trends are relatively large in
December but are relatively small in January, then the
effects due to decreased antecedent snow will tend to
dominate and the 20-year flood would tend to decrease. If
the situation is reversed and the warming trends are small in
December and large in January, then the effects associated
with enlarged contributing basin area would tend to dom-
inate. Figure 2 suggests that, in many cases, we should
expect the latter situation to be more typical. These tradeoffs
are probably also present in the case of snowmelt-dominant
basins (as discussed above), but transient basins are more
sensitive because the two effects are similar in magnitude.
[44] Figures 5 and 6 show the results for the 20- and
100-year recurrence intervals, respectively. The character
of the results for the two recurrence intervals is similar
overall; however, the uncertainties in the 100-year flood
estimates (and their changes with warming) are inherently
larger than those shown for the shorter return interval. This
increased uncertainty in the 100-year flood changes is
characteristic of flood estimates based on fitted probability
distributions, a process which tends to amplify the noise
present in the changes in more frequent flood events when
extrapolating to flood quantiles with longer return intervals.
The regional summary shown in Table 3 demonstrates that
a regionalized flood analysis (as opposed to the at-site fits
shown in Figures 5 and 6) would tend to largely filter out
these effects; however, for the reasons discussed above, we
also want to retain the spatially explicit analysis.
[45] Figures 5 and 6 also compare the effects discussed
above for three different basin sizes (Table 2). Changes
in flood risk for larger spatial scales tend to be smaller

presumably because of cancellation of effects from different
changes in different subbasins. However, there is nothing
here to suggest that the fundamental relationship between
basin average midwinter temperatures and changes in flood
risk associated with warming varies strongly with basin scale.
5.2. Effects of Climate Variability on Flooding Risks
[46] In this section, we show the effects to flood risks
due to (1) temperature and precipitation variability as related
to PDO and ENSO categories, and (2) increased cool season
precipitation variability since 1973. In each case, the uncon-
ditional (not composited) AMS used as a standard of com-
parison is based on the 88-year time series for the detrended
2003 temperature regime. After compositing this time
series by climate category (for example, extracting all warm
ENSO years), the 100-year flood based on the composited
data (see section 4) is compared to the 100-year flood from
the unconditional 2003 distribution. Thus we examine PDO
and ENSO variability in the context of a systematically
warmer climate associated with the end of the 20th century.
This approach avoids problems with earlier years in the
data set having a significantly cooler temperature regime
than latter years, a potentially confounding issue in the
analysis. Table 4 shows the changes in mean monthly total
precipitation in each basin for each climate category
obtained from a compositing analysis.
[47] Figures 7 and 8 show the changes in the 100-year
flood at the smallest spatial scale simulated. The clustering
of flood changes in particular geographic areas of the
domain (for example, effects of ENSO in near coastal areas
of WA, OR, and northern CA) and the lack of a coherent
response associated with basin temperature regimes (scatter-
plots in Figures 7 and 8) suggest that the primary mechanism
that determines flood risks in certain climate categories is
the spatial distribution of winter storms. This is not to say
that cool season temperatures do not vary with ENSO and
PDO, or that these variations do not play some role in
determining flood risks, but such effects are apparently
secondary to storm track behavior affecting precipitation.
[48] During warm PDO and ENSO years, flood risks are
generally lower in the PNW and northern CA, and higher in
southern CA, the GB, and the CRB. For cool PDO and
ENSO categories, this pattern is reversed. These bimodal

spatial patterns are consistent with earlier studies examining
cool season precipitation anomalies associated with PDO
and ENSO [e.g., Dettinger et al., 1998; Gershunov and
Barnett, 1998].
[49] When examining flood risks, the seasonality of
flooding can also play an important role in the changes in
flood risk associated with ENSO and PDO variations, which
have their greatest effect on climate in midwinter. In areas
that typically flood in January or February in the simula-
tions (i.e., coastal areas) when precipitation signals are most
pronounced, changes in floods associated with ENSO and
PDO may be unusually large. This can be seen in the effects
of ENSO on flood risks in basins in western Washington
and Oregon, for example (Figure 8).
[50] Previous studies have shown positive reinforcement
between PDO and ENSO effects [Gershunov and Barnett,
1998; Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 1999; Mote et al., 2003],
and Figure 9 shows ‘‘in phase’’ (i.e., warm PDO/warm
ENSO and cool PDO/cool ENSO) effects from the simu-
lations. Although the sample sizes are quite small in this
instance (about 12 in each case), and the sensitivity of
individual basins may not be robust, there does appear to be
some regional scale positive reinforcement between PDO
and ENSO effects in the context of flood risks, particularly
in the southwest for cool phase events.
[51] While the spatial distribution of effects is shown to
be influenced by ENSO and PDO, there is a random
component to the simulated effects that is evident at the
spatial scales shown in Figures 7–9. The performance of
the model in identifying changes in individual basins of
this size does not encourage assigning great confidence to
these basin-specific effects, and these patterns may in fact
simply be an expression of modeling or GEV parameter
fitting uncertainties. At larger spatial scales, however, there
are sometimes spatially cohesive precipitation signals asso-
ciated with PDO and ENSO that create large changes in
Figure 7. Spatial and scatterplots for the smallest basin size (1700 km2) showing the ratio of the

blue = May, black = June.

flood risks. For the entire Sacramento San Joaquin basin
(120,000 km2), for example, the simulated 100-year flood
(not shown) is about 35% higher during cool ENSO years in
comparison with an unconditional sample, and at this spatial
scale, the model’s performance is reasonably robust (see
previous sections and Figure 4).
[52] The effect of increased cool season precipitation
variability on flood risks for a consistent late 20th century
temperature regime is shown in Figure 10. These simula-
tions suggest that increases in flood risk have occurred over
most of the region as a result of the observed increases in
precipitation variability, despite the lack of any robust
trends in the overall volume of cool season precipitation.
Because these effects are similar over large areas of the
domain, they are also largely scale independent, with larger
basins (not shown) exhibiting similar changes over most of
the domain.
6. Summary and Conclusions
[53] Our simulations suggest that large-scale warming
over the western U.S. in the 20th century (on the order of
1C) has resulted in changes in flood risks in many parts
of the region. Geographical variations are apparent in the
results in some instances (for example, effects in coastal
areas are different than those in the interior); however, the
changes in flood risk due to warming are broadly character-
ized by midwinter temperature regimes in each river basin
across the entire domain. Relatively warm rain-dominant
basins (>5C in midwinter) show little systematic change.
Relatively cold snowmelt basins (<6C in midwinter)
typically show reductions in flood risks because of reduc-
tions in spring snowpack. Moderately cold transient snow
basins show a very wide range of effects depending on
competing factors associated with the relative role of
antecedent snow and contributing basin area during storms
that cause flooding, and coastal basins typically show
larger effects. While the absolute value of changes in flood
risks is affected somewhat by basin scale (larger basins
show smaller changes), the fundamental relationship to
basin temperatures in midwinter appears to be largely scale
independent in the simulations. Although these effects are
well characterized overall by DJF temperature regimes, the
effects of topography and proximity to the Pacific coast on

typically occurs in the simulations: red = January, purple = February, light green = March, dark green =
April, blue = May, black = June.

climate also create considerable spatial coherence in the
results.
[54] Climate variability associated with PDO and ENSO
also affects flood risk in the simulations. In contrast to the
effects associated with 20th century warming, these effects
are characterized by regional scale patterns that are consis-
tent with the geographic distribution of cool season precip-
itation that has been identified in many previous studies.
These effects are, in general, not scale independent in the
simulations, although in some areas where climatic signals
are cohesive over fairly large spatial scales, very large
changes in flood risks can occur in response to precipitation
patterns associated with PDO and ENSO. As for observed
variations in cool season precipitation, the largest changes
in flood risks are associated with years when PDO and
ENSO are in phase.
[55] The gridded precipitation data sets used in this study
show clear increases in the variability of cool season
precipitation over essentially the entire region after about
1973. When examined in the context of a consistent late 20th
century temperature regime, these changes in variability are
shown in the simulations to increase flood risks over most of
the domain. In contrast to the effects related to temperature
and PDO and ENSO variability discussed above, there is no
evidence in the simulations that these changes in precipita-
tion are affecting the flood risks in different regions or basin
types in a unique manner. More work is needed to determine
if these kinds of changes in variability can be rigorously
attributed to global warming processes.
[56] Taken together, the increased precipitation variability
and systematic warming associated with the late 20th
century climate has increased flood risks in rain-dominant
basins (precipitation changes), strongly increased flood

risks in many near coastal areas in WA, OR, and CA with
transient snow (warming and precipitation changes both
tend to increase flood risks), and has probably left flood
risks in many snowmelt-dominant basins and cooler tran-
sient basins in the interior largely unchanged (effects of
warming and precipitation changes are comparable in mag-
nitude and in opposite directions).
[57] The simulated effects of century-scale warming,
climatic variations associated with the PDO and ENSO,
and late 20th century changes in precipitation variability on
flood risks across the region provide evidence that flood
risks are not constant in each year and are slowly evolving
as the region warms. The systematic nature of some of these
changes (particularly the effects of warming) raises inter-
esting and important research questions regarding how to
best account for these gradually evolving flood risks in
determining design standards, updating flood inundation
maps, or creating scenarios for long-term water planning
studies. The evidence of interannual effects on flood risks
associated with ENSO and PDO variations raises similar
questions with regard to water management applications at
interannual timescales. It is not immediately clear, for
example, whether the advantages associated with identify-
ing a potentially altered flood probability distribution out-
weigh the disadvantages associated with a smaller sample
size and increased uncertainty in the estimate of risk. The
effects of increased cool season precipitation variability
since the mid-1970s (whose root causes are not presently
well understood) also present a number of interesting
questions about how to apply this information to planning
and management applications. In particular, it is not clear
whether the changes in precipitation variability over the
region in the late 20th century are systematic in nature (like
temperature changes), or whether this is just one of a
number of normal modes of natural variability that has
been coincident with large-scale warming. If these changes
prove to be related to systematic large-scale precipitation
changes associated with global warming, then the potential
to provide updated information on flood risks exists (as for
temperature effects). If these changes cannot be shown to be
systematic in nature, then it is probably inappropriate to
isolate this time period in estimating flood risks.
[58] Although we do not explore the effects of changing
flood risks on ecological and geomorphological processes
here, it is worth noting that the changes in flood risk we
describe in this paper are likely to result in substantial

the 20-year (left panels), 50-year (center panels), and 100-year (right panels) return intervals compared to

changes in sediment transport and channel formation pro-
cesses, and are also likely to affect ecological processes that
are sensitive to changes in the probability distributions of
high flow events. Studies to examine these potential impact
pathways are needed.
