ABSTRACT
RNA pseudoknots are an important structural
feature of RNAs, but often neglected in computer
predictions for reasons of efficiency. Here, we
present the pknotsRG Web Server for single
sequence RNA secondary structure prediction
including pseudoknots. pknotsRG employs the
newest Turner energy rules for finding the structure
of minimal free energy. The algorithm has been
improved in several ways recently. First, it has been
reimplemented in the C programming language,
resulting in a 60-fold increase in speed. Second, all
suboptimal foldings up to a user-defined threshold
can be enumerated. For large scale analysis, a fast
sliding window mode is available. Further improve-
ments of the Web Server are a new output
visualization using the PseudoViewer Web Service
or RNAmovies for a movie like animation of several
suboptimal foldings.
The tool is available as source code, binary execu-
table, online tool or as Web Service. The latter
alternative allows for an easy integration into bio-
informatics pipelines. pknotsRG is available at the
Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server (http://bibiserv.
techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg).
INTRODUCTION
RNA pseudoknots play an important role in many
biological processes. They build the catalytic core of
some ribozymes (1,2) and are an important building block
of many structural RNAs. Pseudoknots are involved in
telomerase activity (3) and they stimulate eﬃcient
programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF),
a mechanism used by a wide range of RNA viruses to
encode two proteins within one genomic region. In a
recent study (4) over a thousand of potential -1 PRF
signals were detected in the yeast genome. The majority of
signals however seem to direct the ribosome to premature
termination codons. This suggests a mechanism of
post-transcriptional gene regulation through the
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Further
genome wide studies have to elucidate this phenomenon.
This and many more applications require fast RNA
folding algorithms, that are also capable of folding
pseudoknots.
Standard RNA folding programs (5,6) neglect pseudo-
knots for reasons of eﬃciency. While the standard
methods need time proportional to the cube of the input
sequence length, pseudoknot prediction is much
more demanding. This issue has attracted a large body
of bio-informatics work, where all approaches either
abandon the model of free energy minimization, or make
restrictions on the class of pseudoknots that can be
recognized. The well-known algorithm by Rivas and Eddy
(7), which is able to predict a restricted class of
pseudoknots, needs O(n6) time and O(n4) memory space,
where n is the sequence length. Even more restrictive, but
more eﬃcient by two orders of magnitude is the program
pknotsRG by Reeder and Giegerich (8), requiring O(n4)
time and O(n2) space. The new method presented here
re-implements and extends this approach in several
signiﬁcant ways.
TOOL
The program pknotsRG enriches the usual RNA folding
routines by the class of simple recursive pseudoknots.
It uses the current thermodynamic energy model by the
Turner group (5), extended by some pseudoknot speciﬁc
values. pknotsRG oﬀers three basic methods:
(i) Standard MFE folding with pseudoknots: This
method returns the structure of minimum free
energy (MFE), containing a pseudoknot or not.
In the latter case, this structure is identical to the
MFE structure computed by RNAfold from the
Vienna RNA package.
(ii) Enforced folding: The best structure in the folding
space that contains at least one pseudoknot is
reported. This is especially useful, when a pseudo-
knot is suspected, but not computed in the MFE
folding.

(iii) Local folding: The pseudoknot with the best energy
to length ratio is predicted. This mode helps to
identify promising pseudoknot candidates in other-
wise misfolded structures.
These methods were already available in the ﬁrst version
of pknotsRG. In this work we present an extension of this
algorithm, including a complete re-implementation in the
C programming language. This yields a drastically faster
program and allows to accommodate the additional
features with reasonable resource requirements.
The improved run time is best shown by an example:
Folding a sequence of length 200 with the old version
takes 80 s, whereas the new version ﬁnishes within 1 s. Due
to lower memory consumption, we are now also able to
fold very long sequences without being limited by the
computer memory. The folding of 1000 nucleotides
requires only 31MB memory and 10min.
Our ﬁrst extension is the capability to compute near-
optimal structures. Often the native structure of an RNA
is not predicted as the MFE structure. This may stem from
uncertainties in the energy parameters, or the molecule
may not reach its MFE structure, either due to interac-
tions with another molecule or by ending in a kinetic trap.
In such a situation, alternative near-optimal structures
may be better predictions. All methods of pknotsRG can
now be run in a suboptimal mode, where all suboptimal
solutions up to a user-deﬁned threshold are computed.
This is done in a way similar to RNAsubopt (9) from the
Vienna RNA package for pseudoknot-free structures.
Another useful extension for large scale analysis, is a
sliding window technique with adjustable window size and
window position increment. For each position of the
window the analysis is performed according to the user
settings (e.g. enforced mode with 20% suboptimals).
When the window is shifted, only the non-overlapping
part of the new window has to be computed, the old part is
be re-used. Depending on the window size and increment,
this saves a considerable amount of time, much better than
a wrapper program that folds each window independently.
Web server integration
The pknotsRG Web Server (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-
bielefeld.de/pknotsrg) oﬀers an easy and comfortable way
to use the pknotsRG algorithm. Input has to be provided
in a FASTA format containing one single RNA sequence.
All non-nucleotide characters (i.e not A,C,G,T,U,N in
upper or lower case) are removed from the sequence.
The nucleotide ‘T’ is treated as ‘U’ during the folding
routine, ‘N’s are always unpaired. The user selects one of
the three basic modes and optionally an energy threshold
for suboptimal enumeration. If he wants to use the
window mode, at least the window size has to be speciﬁed.
The default window increment is set to one, unless
otherwise speciﬁed. Depending on the user selection,
there are three diﬀerent ways how the result is displayed:
(i) MFE structure only: The computed secondary
structure and its energy are displayed in Vienna
(Dot-Bracket) Notation. Here, a pair of opening
and closing parenthesis denotes a base pair, a dot
represents a single stranded nucleotide. A 2D
visualization is generated using the PseudoViewer
Web service (10). Also, a link to a Connect
formatted ﬁle, originally used by Michael Zukers
mfold (11), is provided. An example output is shown
in Figure 1.
(ii) Suboptimal solutions: The list of suboptimal solu-
tions is displayed as an RNAmovie (12). RNAmovies
displays the individual suboptimal structures one
after another with an adjustable number of inter-
mediate transition steps. This allows for a smooth
morphing from one structure to the next.
Additionally, all suboptimal structures are displayed
as Vienna strings along with their respective energy
value at the bottom of the result page.
(iii) Window mode: For each window, the start and end
position is displayed, followed by the result of the
window folding. This may be one structure (as
Vienna string), or many if the suboptimal mode is
also selected. There is currently no vizualization
provided, when using the window mode. However,
the user can resubmit the sequence of an interesting
window on its own. Then, the vizualizations
explained in (i) and (ii) are automatically generated.
To ensure proper functionality two restrictions are
imposed on the pknotsRG Web Server:
(i) A maximum of 800 nucleotides is allowed for one
submission. This guarantees the computation to
ﬁnish within a few minutes. Note that smaller
requests usually are answered instantly.
(ii) The suboptimal folding space of an RNA sequence
grows exponentially with the energy threshold and
sequence length. We prevent the Web service of
returning too much data, by limiting the number of
returned structures to the ﬁrst 100, respectively,
1000 lines for the window mode.
The web interface is a convenient means for manual
computation, but not designed for automated folding,
i.e. integrated in an Internet-based bio-informatics pipe-
line. For this purpose, we provide a Web Service interface.
This is particularly useful for researchers, who either
cannot or do not want to install pknotsRG locally on their
machines.
The interface is accessible from any computer in any
programming language implementing the SOAP protocol.
The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) ﬁle
describes the functionality of the Web Service and can be
found at (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/wsdl/
pknotsRG.wsdl). Several software development environ-
ments can automatically generate program code from the
WSDL ﬁle for the integration of a Web Service into a local
application. We provide an example client written in Java
on the project homepage.
The extensions presented here have been integrated
into the original pknotsRG program in 2005 and 2006.
Our server statistics indicate 1068 online uses and 773
downloads for local installation in 2006.

RESULTS FROM AN APPLICATION EXAMPLE
Recently, an unusual three-stemmed pseudoknot has been
identiﬁed that promotes programmed -1 ribosomal
frameshifting in the SARS Coronavirus (13). The pseu-
doknot is thought to pause the ribosome during transla-
tion, which then shifts back by one nucleotide on the
‘slippery site’. This special pseudoknot seems to be
conserved in all Coronaviruses, and thus could be a
target for anti-viral therapeutics.
The 3-stem topology is predicted by pknotsRG as
the optimal structure with an energy of 31.8 kcal/mol
(Figure 1), using either the MFE or the enforced mode.
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE RECOGNIZED
CLASS OF PSEUDOKNOTS
General pseudoknot prediction in energy-based models
is a Non-deterministic Polynomial time NP-complete
problem (14), and thus requires exponential run
time. However, if we impose some restrictions on
the helices forming the pseudoknots, we can achieve
faster algorithms. The restrictions in pknotsRG
are motivated by the observation, that most of the
currently known pseudoknots are rather simple ones.
They consist of only two helices, interacting in a crosswise
fashion, as shown in Figure 2. If we allow the unpaired
strands (u,v,w in Figure 2) to build secondary structures
internally in an arbitrary way, including multiloops and
pseudoknots, we call this class simple recursive
pseudoknots.
Our model further restricts this class by three canoniza-
tion rules.
(i) Rule 1: The 50 and 30 part of each pseudoknot helix
must have the same length and must not have an
interruption. This disallows bulges and internal
loops inside pseudoknot stems.
(ii) Rule 2: The pseudoknot helices must have maximal
length, i.e. if there is a possible base pair at either
end, it must be closed.
(iii) Rule 3: If due to Rule 2 the helices would overlap,
the ﬁrst helix (a) is prioritized and the second one is
shortened.

We call the resulting class canonical simple recursive
pseudoknots (csr-pk). Note that all helices not participat-
ing in a pseudoknot are not aﬀected by this canonization.
A detailed discussion about the eﬀects of canonization can
be found in (8).
In an exhaustive analysis of the pseudoknot database
PseudoBase (http://biology.leidenuniv.nl/Batenburg/
PKB.html), it was shown, that out of 212 known
pseudoknots, 172 are simple recursive (8). Almost 80%
of these are even canonical simple recursive pseudoknots.
This shows the abundance of the class csr-pk within all
validated structures.
IMPLEMENTATION
We will brieﬂy sketch the way we implemented these
ideas as an extension of the usual dynamic programming
(DP) scheme for RNA folding [5,6]. Since only two helices
participate in one pseudoknot, we loop over all possible
knots in one O(n4) loop and store the result in a
two-dimensional matrix. More detailed, for a pseudoknot
between bases i and j, the algorithm enumerates all k and l,
such that i5k5l5j. The ﬁrst pseudoknot helix (a in
Figure 2) starts at base pair i and l, the second (b) at
position k and j. Now, we make use of our canonization:
The maximal length of a helix can be pre-computed and
stored in a two-dimensional array. Therefore, after
choosing position k and l, the algorithm looks up the
maximal helix lengths, h for (i, l) and h0 for (k, j) and
checks the applicability of Rule 3. Having the stems
ﬁxed, the location of the three enclosed pseudoknot loops
(u,v,w in Figure 2) follows directly: loop u ranges from
position iþ hþ 1 to k1, loop v from kþ h0þ1 to lh1,
and loop w from lþ 1 to jh01. The best folding for these
smaller subsequences has already been computed earlier in
the DP scheme. The energy sum of the two pseudoknot
helices and the loop folding energies gives us the total
pseudoknot energy. The minimal one over all k and l, is
stored is the two-dimensional pseudoknot matrix. This
value competes with values of unknotted foldings for the
interval (i, j).
During the (suboptimal) backtrace procedure the
pseudoknot matrix is handled in the same way as the
other matrices. Starting with a user-deﬁned energy thresh-
old thr, all suboptimal structures having an energy not
more than thr larger than the optimal structure are
backtraced. For each suboptimal structure s, the threshold
is reduced by the energy diﬀerence to the optimal
structure and the backtrace procedure is called recursively
on the substructures of s, yet with a smaller threshold.
At some point the threshold falls below 0, which means no
further suboptimal structure within the user-deﬁned energy
band can arise from this backtrace.
AVAILABILITY
The program is available for download, both as C source
code and precompiled binary executable for most
common platforms (Solaris, Linux, Windows and
Mac OS X). This version has none of the Web Server
restrictions. It folds arbitrary long sequences and reports
as many suboptimal solutions as the user requests.
The Windows version contains a basic graphical user
interface, the other versions provide a powerful interactive
command line tool. All versions are available in the
download section of the project home page at http://
bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg/.
