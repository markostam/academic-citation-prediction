ABSTRACT
Control of RNA processing plays a central role
in regulating the replication of HIV-1, in particular
the 30 polyadenylation of viral RNA. Based on the
demonstration that polyadenylation of mRNAs can
be disrupted by the targeted binding of modified U1
snRNA, we examined whether binding of U1 snRNAs
to conserved 10 nt regions within the terminal exon
of HIV-1 was able to inhibit viral structural protein
expression. In this report, we demonstrate that
U1 snRNAs complementary to 5 of the 15 regions
targeted result in significant suppression of HIV-1
protein expression and viral replication coincident
with loss of viral RNA. Suppression of viral gene
expression is dependent upon appropriate ass-
embly of a U1 snRNP particle as mutations of U1
snRNA that affect binding of U1 70K or Sm proteins
significantly reduced efficacy. However, constructs
lacking U1A binding sites retained significant anti-
viral activity. This finding suggests a role for these
mutants in situations where the wild-type constructs
cause toxic effects. The conserved nature of the
sequences targeted and the high efficacy of the con-
structs suggests that this strategy has significant
potential as an HIV therapeutic.
INTRODUCTION
As is the case for all retroviruses, replication of HIV-1 is
critically dependent upon the controlled processing of its
RNA. From a single 9 kb viral transcript, 15 proteins are
generated through the process of suboptimal splicing that
generates over 30 viral mRNAs (1,2). Control of splicing
is achieved in part through the suboptimal nature of the
30 splice sites (ss) present (3–5) as well as the presence of
both exon splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exon splicing
silencers (ESSs) (5–11). In the course of analyzing the role
of the ESE within the terminal exon of HIV-1 RNA, we
observed that, in addition to promoting the use of the adjacent
30 ss, the ESE was also required for the 30 end cleavage and
polyadenylation of the incompletely spliced viral RNAs (12).
Deletion of this ESE resulted in loss of gp160 expression due
to a failure to transport the incompletely spliced viral RNA to
the cytoplasm (12,13). The correlation of the block to viral
RNA export with a reduction in 30 end formation suggested
that targeting this step in the viral life cycle may provide
an additional strategy to control HIV-1 replication.
The formation of the 30 end of RNA polymerase II tran-
scripts is determined in large part by two sequences within
the RNA; the consensus AAUAAA polyadenylation signal
and the downstream enhancing sequence consisting of either
a G or G/U-rich region (14,15). In addition to these basic
signals, evidence has also emerged for regulation by trans-
acting factors, one of which is U1 snRNA. In several systems
studied to date [HIV-1 polyadenylation near the start site of
transcription, polyadenylation of the late transcripts of bovine
papillomavirus (BPV)], interaction of U1 snRNP via base-
pairing close to the polyadenylation signal results in either
inhibition of the cleavage or polyadenylation portion of the
30 end processing reaction (16–20). More recently, this effect
has been exploited to suppress other genes by the expression
of variants of U1 snRNA in which the first 10 nt have been
substituted with a sequence complementary to the gene of
interest (21–23). Provided that the targeted sequence is pre-
sent within the terminal exon of the gene of interest and
not present within secondary structure (i.e. is accessible for
base pairing with U1 snRNA), a significant inhibition of
gene expression can be achieved.
To explore the utility of U1 snRNA variants to inhibit
HIV-1 gene expression, we identified highly conserved 10 nt
sequences within the terminal exon of the M and O clades
of HIV-1 and prepared U1 snRNAs expression vectors with
complementarity to 15 of these regions. Several of these con-
structs induced a dramatic suppression of the expression of
HIV-1 p55/p24 upon cotransfection with a HIV-1 proviral
expression vector. Little or no effect on expression of these
proteins was detected upon overexpression of U1 snRNAs
that had no complementarity to HIV-1 and the anti-HIV-1
constructs had no effect on other co-transfected reporter vec-
tors. Combination of anti-HIV constructs leads to an even
greater degree of inhibition. The loss of viral protein expres-
sion was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in levels of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bioinformatics
A computation-based selection algorithm was devised for the
selection of potential anti-HIV target sites in the 30-terminal
exon of HIV transcripts. Consensus sequences of the env and
nef regions of all M and O clades of HIV-1 were retrieved
from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (http://www.
hiv.lanl.gov/) and were aligned using ClustalW (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) followed by manual adjustment of
the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using BioEdit
(http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) or JalView
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~michele/jalview/). A set of well-
conserved continuous 10 nt sites was identified by inspection
of the MSA. The number of BLAST hits returned for each
potential target site against the HIV-1 or human subset of
GenBank sequences was recorded. The SR-value of a 10 bp
site is defined as the number of BLAST hits returned for the
oligo against GenBank HIV-1 sequences. The number of
returned BLAST hits for the same oligo against GenBank
human sequences was assigned a value N, the number of hits
for a non-HIV directed oligo [anti-CAT, (21)] was designated
M. The SF-value of an oligo was calculated using its associated
SR, N and M values according to the formula SF ¼ SR/(N/M).
Multiple sites that satisfy the condition SF > SR were selected
for the construction of U1 targeting constructs described.
Plasmid constructs
HIV-1 Hxb2 R-/RI- was provided by E. Cohen (Institut de
recherche cliniques de Montreal). Generation of U1 targeting
vectors has been previously described (21). The mutant U1
anti-HIV snRNA expression constructs pU1 aHIV-1#1-15
were derived from pUCB U1 [provided by H. Schaal
(Institute of Virology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,
Germany)] by PCR (21) or using quickchange mutagenesis
(Stratagene). Targeted sequences are indicated in Table 1.
Figure 1 illustrates the relative positions of five of the
target sites in the HIV-1 30 LTR proximal region. The follow-
ing system of nomenclature is employed in this report regard-
ing U1 targeting constructs: pU1 aHIV-1 #1 or pU1 aCAT
refers to the plasmid encoding the 50 end mutated U1
snRNA sequence while U1 aHIV-1 #1 or U1 aCAT
refers to the inhibiting U1 snRNAs expressed from those
plasmids.
To investigate the requirement for the various U1 snRNP
protein components to achieve suppression of HIV-1 expres-
sion, a number of mutants of the aHIV-1 #1 and #5 expres-
sion vector were generated by quickchange (Stratagene) using
the following primer pairs: DSL1, 50-CGAAGATCTCAAC-

tion with 1.0 mg of HxBruR/RI and a maximum of 4 mg
of pUCB U1 or its derivatives (24). At 48 h post-transfection,
cells were harvested and lysed in whole cell lysis buffer
(10 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%

orthovanadate) for 20 min. For p24 blots, protein lysates
were fractionated on 12% SDS–PAGE then transferred onto

Northern blot analysis
293T cells (3 · 106) were transfected with 4 mg of
HxBruR/RI and a total of 12 mg of pUCB U1 or its deriva-

(pH 7), 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.1M b-mercaptoethanol). Total RNA
was isolated (25) and analyzed by northern blotting. Blots
were probed with 32P labeled DNA to HIV-1 LTR (generated
by PCR using the primers 50-CTAATTCACTCCCAACG-
AAGA-30 and 50-TGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTG-30), end
labeled oligo to GAPDH (50-AAAGGTGGAGGAGTGGGT-
GTCGCTGTTGAA-30), or end labeled oligos specific for
each of the U1 snRNA variants (anti-HIV #1 50-CCTGCC-
TTCAGCTAC-30; anti-HIV #5 CCTGCCATC CGGAGT-30).
Viral challenge assays
To assess the ability of the anti-HIV U1 constructs to suppress
HIV-1 replication, HeLa CD4+ cells lines were generated
expressing vector alone, U1 6A, or anti-HIV #5. Following
selection for stably transduced cells (using puromycin),
pooled clones were subsequently used in the viral challenge
assay. For HIV-1 infection, 0.5 · 106 cells were plated into
tissue culture 6-well, flat-bottom, dishes. After culture for
24 h, cells were infected with 0.3 moi of HIV-1IIIB virus
for 1hr at 37oC as previously described (26). The cells were
then washed three times with PBS lacking Ca2+/Mg2+ and left
in 2 ml of media. On day three of culture, 0.5 ml aliquots
were collected and assayed for production of virus by using
HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA kit (Beckman-Coulter Inc.).
RESULTS
Computation-based selection of anti-HIV target sites
in the 30-terminal exon of viral transcripts
U1 snRNP mediated inhibition of polyadenylation requires
localization of the modified U1 snRNP particle to the 30-
terminal exon of the target transcript (22). This is accom-
plished by base pairing the 50 end of the U1 snRNA in its
associated RNP complex to a complementary region in
the target pre-mRNA. To achieve selective targeting of U1
snRNA to sequences in HIV-1, we not only identified con-
served sequences in the virus but also eliminated the U1
sequences having a significant number of interactions with
host cell mRNAs. Due to the 10 nt length of the targeted
sequence, binding sites are expected to occur approximately
once in 106 bases, corresponding to 3000 occurrences in
the human genome. However, since exons constitute only
2% of the human genome (27) and inhibition by U1 snRNP
particles requires base-pairing to unstructured regions in the
30-terminal exon of transcripts containing AAUAAA type
poly(A) signals (22), the specificity of inhibition can be sub-
stantially improved with judicious selection of target sites. In
light of the few published studies on U1 snRNA-mediated
reduction of target gene expression (21,22), rational design
of anti-HIV U1 constructs based on the characteristics
of known effective target sites cannot be achieved at this
point. To facilitate the discovery of HIV sequences suscepti-
ble to U1-mediated inhibition that would provide broad cov-
erage for all HIV-1 strains, a MSA of consensus sequences of
the env and nef regions of all M and O group HIV-1 subtypes
was generated and a number of highly conserved 10 bp
sequences identified in the MSA. The number of BLAST
hits returned for a given 10 bp sequence against HIV-1
sequences in GenBank was determined and defined as the
Raw Score (SR-value). The magnitude of the SR-value is pro-
portional to the extent of conservation observed in the MSA.
This value was then scaled according to the number of
BLAST hits in the human genome returned for each sequence
to derive the Final Score (SF-value). Sequences with the least
hits upon scanning of the human genome were deemed
suitable for targeting and placed in a list of candidate sites.
Selection of target sites within highly conserved regions of
the HIV-1 genome allows the identification of universal tar-
gets common to all subtypes. In addition, the conservation
of these sites among HIV-1 subtypes suggests that mutations
within these regions would have detrimental effects to the
virus. Using this computational strategy, multiple anti-HIV
targets were identified in the 30 LTR proximal region of
HIV-1 of which five were chosen for initial evaluation. The
sequence and position of a subset of the selected target sites
are shown in Figure 1A and B. All selected sites reside in the
env or nef region and are present in the 30-terminal exon of
all viral transcripts. Selection of these target sites ensures
that the expression of all viral proteins will be affected.
Targeting of the HIV-1 30-terminal exons with anti-HIV
U1 constructs inhibits viral gene expression at both the
protein and RNA level
Having selected a number of sites within the terminal exon of
HIV-1 that met the desired criteria, five U1 expression vec-
tors were generated in which the first 10 nt of the transcript
was able to base pair to one of the sites. To measure their
anti-viral capacity, U1 snRNA expression plasmids were
co-transfected with plasmid HxBruR/RI that contains a
HIV-1 provirus in which the RT and IN genes have been
deleted. In addition to the five anti-HIV U1 variants, parallel
transfections were performed with vectors expressing
unmodified U1 snRNA (U1 wt), a point mutant of U1 (U1
6A) that abolished activity in splicing, and a U1 variant
targeted to chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) (22).
Effect of U1 snRNA expression on HIV-1 gene expression
was monitored by western blot for p24. As shown in
Figure 1C, three of the five anti-HIV constructs tested (#1,
#3 and #5) resulted in a significant reduction in HIV-1 gene
expression. In contrast, U1 6A and U1 a-CAT had little to no
effect relative to U1 wt (see Figure 1C). Parallel examination
of the effect of these vectors on a non-target RNA (secreted
alkaline phosphatase, SEAP) failed to show significant levels
of inhibition (Figure 1D). The failure to see any large changes
in SEAP expression suggests that the viral inhibition obser-
ved cannot be attributed to gross toxicity to the cell. In light
of this success, we continued to evaluate additional sites
within the HIV-1 provirus for their susceptibility to this
inhibitory strategy. As detailed in Table 1, 15 sites in total
were targeted of which only five yielded significant reduction
on viral p24 expression.

Having established the potency of a subset of the U1
aHIV-1 constructs, we tested the relative efficacy of the
anti-HIV U1 targeting vectors alone or in combination.
Two U1 aHIV-1 vectors were selected to assess their potency
(U1 aHIV-1 #1 and U1 aHIV-1 #5). The two anti-HIV U1
targeting vectors were co-transfected individually or in com-
bination with the proviral clone HxBruR/RI at increasing
concentrations. The level of viral protein and RNA accumu-
lation at 48 h post-transfection was assessed by western and
northern blots, respectively. As shown in Figure 2A, the anti-
HIV U1 constructs differed in the amount of plasmid required
to suppress viral structural protein (p24 and p55) expression,
anti-HIV #5 requiring 2 mg of transfected plasmid while anti-
HIV #1 achieved the same degree of suppression at lower
levels (0.5 mg of transfected plasmid). Combination of the
two anti-HIV constructs (#1 and #5) was able to suppress
viral gene expression at all concentrations tested. To explore
the basis for the observed response, the effect of the U1
constructs on viral RNA levels was subsequently explored
(Figure 2B). Cotransfection with vectors expressing anti-
HIV #1 or #5 alone led to significant reduction in viral RNA
levels. Further reduction was achieved when the two con-
structs were added in combination. In contrast, little or no
change in viral RNA levels was detectable upon cotransfec-
tion with the control vectors (U16A, U1 anti-CAT, data not
shown).
Inhibitory activity is dependent on proper assembly
of a U1 snRNP particle
Modified U1 snRNAs have been used in the past to suppress
HIV-1 gene expression, but in that instance more extensive
regions of base-pairing (61–68 bases) were used along with
deletion of stem–loop 1 (DSL1) of the resultant RNA (28).
Loss of HIV-1 expression in that study was attributed to
RNA degradation due to an anti-sense mechanism. To test
Figure 2. Suppression of HIV-1 gene expression occurs at the level of both viral protein and RNA. Cells were transfected with proviral DNA (pHxb2 R-/RI-)
and 4 mg of U1 wt/aCAT expression vector or increasing amounts of aHIV #1/#5 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 mg) alone or in combination. Forty-eight hours
post-transfection, cells were harvested and either (A) used to examine HIV-1 p24 expression or (B) RNA extracted and levels of RNA determined by northern
blot. Representative gels are shown indicating the position of the viral RNAs (upper), GAPDH (middle) and U1 snRNA variants (lower).

whether the inhibition seen in this study was operating
through the same or another mechanism, we examined
whether the response was dependent upon proper assembly
of the U1 snRNP particle. If mutants in the various protein
assembly domains of U1 snRNA do not alter the response,
then only base-pairing potential would be deemed necessary
for the loss of HIV-1 expression (suggestive of an anti-sense
mechanism). Five variants of aHIV #5 U1 snRNA were gen-
erated to probe the requirement of the various regions of the
U1 snRNA for function: DSL1 or substitutions in stem–loop
1 that results in loss of U1 70 K binding (SL1mut), deletion
of stem–loop 2 (DSL2) or substitutions in stem–loop 2 that
results in loss of U1A binding (SL2 mut), and mutations
within the Sm binding region (DSm) that abolish assembly
of the Sm core (Figure 3A) (29). Cotransfection of these
mutant U1 snRNAs with proviral DNA revealed four of the
five mutants had no inhibitory activity; expression of HIV-1
p24 was similar to that seen with wt U1 snRNA (Figure 3B).
Only aHIV #5 SL2mut retained some inhibitory activity
although significantly less than that of the unmodified variant.
To assess whether this phenomenon was limited to only one
construct or was valid for all U1 variants, both SL1mut and
SL2mut mutations were introduced in the context of anti-
HIV #1. As shown in Figure 3C, the same spectrum of effects
was observed, mutation of SL1 leading to abolition of anti-
HIV activity while SL2 mutants retained low but significant
anti-viral activity.
The residual anti-viral activity of the SL2 mutants raised
the possibility that these constructs may serve as alternatives
should the unmodified anti-viral U1 RNAs have deleterious
effects on the cell. To probe this issue further, we assessed
the anti-viral activities of the SL2mut constructs alone or
in combination (Figure 4). Consistent with their reduced
activity, higher amounts of each plasmid were required to
repress HIV-1 gene expression (data not shown). However,
when used in combination, significant inhibition of viral
p24 expression (to background) was achievable, albeit using
higher amounts of plasmid. To test whether this effect
was attributable to a similar effect on viral RNA expression,
Northern blots were also carried out. As shown in Figure 4B,
when used in combination SL2 mutants of anti-HIV #1 and
#5 led to a significant reduction in HIV-1 RNA levels. A
similar response is not evident upon expression of the SL1
variants of the same constructs (Figure 4B).
Cells stably expressing anti-HIV U1 snRNAs show
reduced capacity to support HIV replication
While the experiments to date have clearly established the
anti-HIV properties of the U1 constructs generated, we were
interested in examining their properties under conditions that
more accurately mimicked the in vivo situation. Toward this
end, stable cells expressing one of the anti-viral U1 constructs
was generated and challenged with virus. As shown in
Figure 5, monitoring of p24 production in the media follow-
ing viral challenge revealed a reduction in HIV-1 replication
in only the cell line expressing the anti-HIV U1 snRNA vari-
ant. Little to no change in p24 levels was seen with cells
expressing either of the control vectors (U1 wt, U16A).
Although the inhibition of HIV-1 replication seen in the
context of the stable cell lines is less than that observed in
transient assays (see Figure 1), subsequent analysis has
revealed that expression of the U1 constructs is considerably
below that obtained in the transient assays (data not shown).
Current efforts are directed at improving the expression of the
modified U1 snRNAs.
DISCUSSION
Maturation of pre-mRNA in eukaryotes involves a set of
factors that modify the primary transcript into an export
competent mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein) complex,
the formation of which signals its release from the site of
transcription and export into the cytoplasm for translation
(30). These processing events include capping, splicing,
30 end cleavage and polyadenylation. Proper 30 end formation
promotes transcription termination (15) and nuclear export of
the mRNA (31) and enhances the stability and translation of
the mature transcript in the cytoplasm (32,33). Recent evi-
dence implicates the existence of extensive coupling between

the gene expression machinery engaged in mRNA synthesis,
processing, export and surveillance (34–36) suggesting that
disruption of RNA processing will compromise proper gene
expression.
Binding of U1 snRNP upstream of the AAUAAA signal
in the 30-terminal exon inhibits the polyadenylation step in
30 end formation by disrupting the protein–protein interac-
tions in the polyadenylation machinery (20). In contrast,
interaction between U1 snRNP and the major splice donor
site downstream of the HIV-1 50 LTR poly(A) site inactivates
the cleavage step in a U1 70 K dependent manner and is
thought to be important for production of full-length genomic
RNA (29). Here we demonstrated, for the first time, that the
same component of the splicing machinery recruited by HIV
for its survival can be re-programmed to direct its demise.
The target site selection algorithm employed in this study
does not account for possible local secondary structure
formation which might explain the failure of several of the
aHIV constructs to elicit a significant reduction in viral
protein production. However, dramatic reduction of viral
structural protein expression by five of the constructs (#1,
#3, #5, #7 and #12) was observed in this study with little
or no effect on expression of the co-transfected SEAP vector.
Synergistic inhibition of HIV gene expression by U1 target-
ing was likely achieved at two levels. The sites targeted are
common to all viral transcripts, so expression of all viral pro-
teins is suppressed by U1 targeting. Hence, reduction of viral
RNA is not only achieved by direct destabilization of the
RNA but also by loss of Tat and the transactivation of the
HIV-1 LTR (37). It should be noted that maximum possible
inhibition of viral gene expression was likely not observed in
this study. The assembly of functional U1 snRNP particles
takes at least 16 h (22,38). Therefore, a delay exists between
the initiation of gene expression from the co-transfected pro-
virus and when significant nuclear accumulation of anti-HIV
U1 snRNPs has occurred.
In addition to establishing the anti-viral activity of the
modified U1 snRNAs, we also demonstrate that activity of
the aHIV U1 snRNAs is dependent upon proper assembly
of the U1 snRNP. Mutations which affected any component
of this RNP abolished function, the sole exception being
point mutants within stem–loop 2 that affect U1A binding.
Assembly of the Sm core is a requisite for import of U1
snRNA (38) into the nucleus while U1 70K has been shown
to be required for inhibiting the cleavage/polyadenylation
reaction (18,29). These observations suggest that it is unlikely
that these constructs are functioning solely in an anti-sense
manner. The partial activity of the SL2mut variant of aHIV
#1 and #5 raises the possibility that they could be used in
gene therapy protocols should the intact form of the snRNA
prove to have deleterious side effects.
The high activity of U1 snRNA variants targeted to HIV-1
and their distinct mechanism of action raises the possibility
that they could be used in a complementary fashion with
Figure 4. SL2mut variants of anti-HIV U1 snRNAs retain anti-viral activity.
(A) Cells were transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA (HIV-1 Hxb2 R-/RI-)
and vector expressing anti-HIV #1/#5 SL2mut snRNA either alone or in
combination. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and
lysates analyzed for p24 expression by western blot. (B) Cells were
transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA (HIV-1 Hxb2 R-/RI-) and vector
expressing anti-HIV #1/#5 wild-type, SL2mut, or SL1mut snRNAs either
alone or in combination. Total RNA was subsequently extracted and levels of
viral RNA, and GAPDH RNA assayed by northern blot. Shown is
representative gel of the results obtained. Identity of viral RNAs, GAPDH
RNA and U1 snRNA variants (lower) are as indicated.
Figure 5. Cells stably expressing anti-HIV #5 U1 snRNA show reduced
capacity to support HIV-1 replication. HeLa CD4+ cells lines were isolated
following transfection with pBABE vectors expressing without insert (puro),
U1wt, or anti-HIV #5. Following selection for stable integrants, the pooled
clones were challenged with HIV-1 and p24 production assayed five days
post-infection by ELISA. Shown are the averages of two independent
experiments and a total of four independent assays. Asterisk indicates values
that are different from control cells (Mock) at a P-value <0.05.

RNAi to achieve a significant barrier to HIV-1 replication
(39–42). While the U1 snRNA based strategy would affect
the nuclear metabolism of the viral RNA, RNAi could be
used to reduce the concentration of the same RNA in the
cytoplasm, the location of the RISC complex. Future work
will focus on expanding the number of U1 snRNA variants
with anti-HIV-1 activity and exploration of the durability of
the response to multiple viral strains and detection of resistant
HIV-1 variants following serial passages of virus on cells
expressing these constructs. The demonstrated efficacy of this
approach for HIV-1 suggests it may prove of equal value in
the suppression of replication of other viruses which display
a similar reliance on the host cell polyadenylation machinery
for replication.
