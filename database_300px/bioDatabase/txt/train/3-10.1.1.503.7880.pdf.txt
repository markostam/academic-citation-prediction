ABSTRACT
The DNA replication-related element binding factor
(DREF) plays an important role in regulation of cell
proliferation in Drosophila, binding to DRE and
activating transcription of genes carrying this ele-
ment in their promoter regions. Overexpression of
DREF in eye imaginal discs induces a rough eye
phenotype in adults, which can be suppressed by
half dose reduction of the osa or moira (mor) genes
encoding subunits of the BRM complex. This ATP-
dependent chromatin remodeling complex is known
to control gene expression and the cell cycle. In the
5’ flanking regions of the osa and mor genes, DRE
and DRE-like sequences exist which contribute to
their promoter activities. Expression levels and
promoter activities of osa and mor are decreased
in DREF knockdown cells and our results in vitro
and in cultured cells indicate that transcription of
osa and mor is regulated by the DRE/DREF regula-
tory pathway. In addition, mRNA levels of other BRM
complex subunits and a target gene, string/cdc25,
were found to be decreased by knockdown of DREF.
These results indicate that DREF is involved in
regulation of the BRM complex and thereby the cell
cycle.
INTRODUCTION
Promoter regions of DNA replication-related genes
contain a common regulatory sequence, 50-TATCGATA,
named the DNA replication-related element (DRE) (1). A
speciﬁc DRE-binding factor (DREF) has been identiﬁed
(2) and numerous studies have revealed that the DREF/
DRE system is required for the expression of many genes
involved in cell proliferation and the cell cycle (3).
Computational analysis of Drosophila gene promoters
revealed that DRE is one of the most prevalent motifs in
core promoters (4). In fact immunostaining of polytene
chromosomes with antiDREF antibody revealed that
DREF binds to hundreds of interband regions on the
polytene chromosomes (5). In addition SAGE analyses
revealed that DRE exists in upstream regions of many
genes expressed in proliferating cells in eye imaginal discs
(6). RNAi-mediated knockdown of DREF in growing
tissues also provided direct evidence that it is necessary for
cell cycle and cell growth control (7,8).
It is reported that DREF is a component of the TATA
box-binding protein-related factor 2 (TRF2) complex (9),
which interacts with basal transcription machinery (10).
This complex is directed to promoters of the PCNA and
DNA polymerase a 180 kDa genes and upregulates their
expression (9). DNA-binding activity of DREF is
inhibited by dMi-2, which is the ATPase of an ATP-
dependent chromatin remodeling complex (5). In addition,
a homeodomein protein Dll interacts with the DNA-
binding domain of DREF and prevents its DRE-binding
activity (11).
Overexpression of the DREF in eye imaginal discs
induces ectopic S phase, apoptosis and inhibited photo-
receptor cell diﬀerentiation, resulting in a rough eye
phenotype in adults. Enhancement of this phenotype was
observed in crosses of DREF-overexpressing ﬂies with Dll
mutants. This observation combined with molecular and
biochemical analyses suggested that Dll is a negative
regulator of DREF (11,12).
By genetic screening of mutations that modify the rough
eye phenotype, we searched for other genes that geneti-
cally interact with DREF. For example, the rough eye
phenotype was suppressed by half dose reduction of the
trithorax group genes brahma (brm), osa and moira (mor)
(12) known to maintain expression patterns of homeotic
genes (13). The three genes encode subunits of the BRM
complex, a SWI/SNF class ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeling complex in Drosophila, altering nucleosome
structures to activate or repress gene transcription (14,15).
BRM complexes can be subclassiﬁed into BAP and PBAP
types depending on their signature subunits (16). OSA is
speciﬁc to BAP, and Polybromo and BAP170 are speciﬁc
to PBAP complex. BRM, MOR and ﬁve other proteins
(Snr1, BAP111, BAP60, BAP55 and Actin) are shared
with both complexes (16). Recent studies have revealed

functional diﬀerences between BAP and PBAP in cell
cycle regulation (17), only BAP promoting G2/M pro-
gression. BRM complexes also genetically interact with
cell cycle regulators, E2F and cyclin E (18,19), suggesting a
role in negatively controlling G1/S progression.
To clarify the relationship between DREF and BRM
complexes, we searched for DRE or DRE-like sequences
in 50 ﬂanking regions of brm, osa and mor, and found
examples in the osa and mor genes. Binding of DREF to
DRE in both genes could be demonstrated in vitro and
in vivo and luciferase transient expression assays conﬁrmed
that DRE and DREF are important in their promoter
activities. Furthermore, mRNA levels of osa and mor were
reduced in DREF knockdown cells. These results indicate
that transcription of osa and mor is regulated by the DRE/
DREF regulatory pathway. In addition, mRNA levels of
other BRM complex subunits and of its target gene,
string/cdc25, were decreased by knockdown of DREF.
These results taken together revealed that DREF is
involved in regulation of BRM complexes and conse-
quently the cell cycle.

Cell culture
Schneider (S2) cells were cultured in M3(BF) medium (22),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 258C
in 5% CO2.
DNA transfection into cells and luciferase assays
Approximately 1 105 S2 cells were plated 24 h before
transfection, then 500 ng of reporter plasmid and 1 ng of
pAct5C-seapansy as an internal control were cotrans-
fected into the cells using CellFectin reagent (Invitrogen).
At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and luci-
ferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
All assays were performed within the range of linear
relation of activity to incubation time and values were
normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Transfections
were performed several times with at least two indepen-
dent plasmid preparations.
For double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) interference
experiments, 30 mg of DREF dsRNA or LacZ dsRNA in
FBS-free M3(BF) medium were added to 1 106 S2 cells
for 1 h. dsRNA-free incubation was conducted as a
control for 1 h in FBS-free M3(BF). After the incubation,
4 v of M3(BF) medium containing 10% FBS were added.
After 72 h of RNAi treatment, 1 105 cells were
cotransfected with reporter genes, 2 mg of reporter plasmid
and 1 ng of pAct5C-seapansy plasmids, with the aid of
Cell-Fectin reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
At 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured
as described above.
Western immunoblot analysis
S2 cells (1 106) were collected and lysed as described
earlier (23). They were applied to 10% SDS–polyacryl-
amide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in transfer
buﬀer (50mM borate–NaOH, pH 9.0, 20% methanol).
The blotted membranes were incubated with antiDREF
monoclonal antibodies (2) at 1:10 000 dilution or
antiTubulin IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 1:5000
for 16 h at 48C. The bound antibodies were detected with
peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG and the ECL
system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations, and images were
analyzed with a Lumivision Pro HSII image analyzer
(Aisin Seiki, Aichi, Japan).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as
reported previously (1), with minor modiﬁcations.
Preparation of Kc cell nuclear extracts was described
elsewhere (1). They were mixed with double-stranded
32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides (100 000 cpm) in a
reaction buﬀer [15mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 60mM KCl,
0.1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 12% glycerol and 0.1mg/ml

poly(dI-dC)], and incubated for 15min at 08C. When
necessary, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added as
competitors at this step. DNA–protein complexes were
electrophoretically resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in
50mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3, 1mM EDTA and 2.5%
glycerol. The gels were dried and autoradiographed.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were also per-
formed in the presence of antiDREF monoclonal anti-
body 1, antiDREF monoclonal antibody 4 (2) or normal
mouse IgG as a control. Kc cell nuclear extracts were
mixed with each antibody, incubated for 2 h at 08C and
added to mixtures containing 32P-labeled synthetic oligo-
nucleotides (100 000 cpm). After 15min incubation at 08C,
electrophoresis was carried out as described above.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using
a Chip Assay kits as recommended by the manufacturer
(Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA) (24). Approximately
1 107 S2 cells were ﬁxed in 1% formaldehyde at 378C for
10min and then quenched in 125mM glycine for 5min at
258C. The cells were then washed in PBS containing
protease inhibitors (1mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml aprotinin and
1 mg/ml pepstatin A) and lysed in SDS lysis buﬀer.
Lysates were sonicated to break DNA and the sonicated
cell supernatants were diluted 10-fold in chip dilution
buﬀer. Supernatant was precleared with Protein A
Agarose/Salmon Sperm DNA (50% slurry) for 30min
at 48C. After brief centrifugation, each supernatant was
incubated with 1 mg of the rabbit IgG or antiDREF
polyclonal antibody for 16 h at 48C. Protein A Agarose/
Salmon Sperm DNA (50% slurry) was added, with
incubation for 1 h at 48C. After washing, immunopreci-
pitated DNA was eluted with elution buﬀer (1% SDS,
0.1M NaHCO3). Then the protein–DNA crosslinks were
reversed by heating at 658C for 4 h. After deproteiniza-
tion with proteinase K, DNA was recovered by phenol–
chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.
The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were detected
by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Premix Ex
Taq (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and the ABI PRISM 7000
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo,
Japan). Primer pairs for PCR were described above.
Quantitative RT-PCR
S2 cells were exposed to 30 mg of dsRNA and at 5 days
after dsRNA treatment total RNA was isolated using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA was prepared
with a Takara high ﬁdelity RNA PCR kit using the oligo
dT primer (Takara) for PCR with SYBR Premix Ex Taq
(Takara) and the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). Ct values were normalized
to that of the Rp49 gene.

diﬀerentiation in eye imaginal discs so that adult ﬂies
exhibited a severe rough eye phenotype (12) (Figure 1A
and B), but their viability and fertility were normal.
Therefore, we utilized these ﬂies as a genetic tool for
screening of mutations that can modify the rough eye
phenotype (11,25–27).
Previously we reported that half dose reduction of the
trithorax group genes, osa and mor suppressed the DREF-
induced rough eye phenotype (12). Here, we further con-
ﬁrmed that the F1 progeny of crosses between the DREF
overexpressing strain and osa2, osa00090 or mor1 mutant
ﬂies showed suppression of the rough eye phenotype
(Figure 1C–H). Although their eyes were modestly rough,
fused ommatidia were not apparent, suggesting that osa
and mor are DREF target genes or positive regulators of
the DRE/DREF regulatory pathway.
The 5’ flanking regions of the osa andmor genes
contain DRE and DRE-like sequences
On the basis of our evidence that osa and mor might be
DREF target genes, we searched for DRE or DRE-like
sequences within 1.4 kb genomic regions from the tran-
scription initiation sites of each of these genes. It has been
described that DRE within such regions can upregulate
transcription, a central 6 bp of DRE being suﬃcient for
DREF to bind and activate the promoter (1,28).
In the 50 ﬂanking region of the osa gene, one DRE and
two DRE-like sequences were identiﬁed, and named DRE1
(14 to 21), DRE2a (243 to 250) and DRE2b (249
to 256) (Figure 2A). DRE1 was found to perfectly match
the 8 bp DRE sequence, 50-TATCGATA, while DRE2a
and DRE2b each, matched 7 out of 8 bp.
In the promoter region of the mor gene, one DRE and
two DRE-like sequences were found. They were named
DRE1 (2 to 9), DRE2 (26 to 33) and DRE3 (718
to 725) (Figure 2B), DRE2 perfectly matching the con-
sensus DRE sequence and DRE1 and DRE3 showing
identity in 6 out of 8 bp. Since all of these sites were
detected in located at positions within 1.4 kb of the trans-
cription initiation site, they are good candidate transcrip-
tional regulatory sites for the osa and mor genes.
Roles of DRE sites in osa andmor gene promoter activities
To examine the roles of the DREs in osa promoter
activity, we carried out luciferase transient expression
assays in cultured Drosophila S2 cells. We constructed a
osa promoter–luciferase fusion plasmid and derivatives
carrying mutations in one or more of DRE1, DRE2a
and DRE2b. These plasmids were transfected into S2 cells
and luciferase activities were measured. Mutation in
DRE1 (osa-DRE1mut) reduced the promoter activity by
49% relative to that of the wild-type promoter. Mutations
in DRE2a (osa-DRE2amut) and DRE2b (osa-
DRE2bmut) reduced the promoter activity by 21 and
19%, respectively. Mutations in both DRE2a and DRE2b
(osa-DRE2abmut) reduced it by 20%. Mutations in all
DREs (osa-DRE1 and 2abmut) reduced the promoter
activity by 76% (Figure 3A). These results indicate that
DRE1 mainly acts for activation of the osa promoter
while DRE2 might have a supporting role.
The roles of DREs in mor promoter activity were
examined in a similar way. Mutations in any one of three
DREs alone exerted no eﬀects on mor promoter activity
and only slight reduction was noted with mutations in any
two of the three. However, when all three DREs were
mutated simultaneously, promoter activity was decreased
by 73% (Figure 3B). These results revealed that all DREs
can contribute to mor promoter activation and any one
appears to be suﬃcient for activity.
Effects of knockdown of theDREF gene on osa
andmor gene promoter activity
Endogenous osa and mor gene expression in RNAi-
mediated DREF knockdown cells was examined to
demonstrate that osa and mor are DREF target genes.
Total RNAs from dsRNA-treated S2 cells were isolated
and quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to measure the
level of mRNAs. The DREF mRNA level was reduced by
95% in DREFdsRNA-treated cells, but was not changed
in LacZdsRNA-treated cells (Figure 4A). Under these
conditions, the level of osa mRNA was decreased to 32%
and that of mor mRNA to 14% relative to those with no
RNAi treatment (Figure 4A). The -tubulin gene was used
as a negative control and its expression was not aﬀected by
DREFdsRNA treatment (Figure 4A).
To further investigate the requirement of DREF for osa
and mor promoter activity, we performed luciferase tran-
sient expression in DREF knockdown cells. DREFdsRNA
or LacZdsRNA were added to S2 cells, and reduction
of DREF protein was conﬁrmed by western blotting.
DREF protein was not detectable at 2, 4 and 6 days after
DREFdsRNA treatment, while no change was evident in
mock and LacZdsRNA-treated cells (Figure 4B). The
luciferase reporter plasmids were transfected into S2
cells at 3 days after RNAi treatment, and luciferase activ-
ities were determined. In DREFdsRNA-treated cells, the
wild-type osa promoter activity was decreased to 61% and
mor promoter activity to 51% of those in non-dsRNA
treatment cells. The promoter activities of both genes were
not changed in LacZdsRNA-treated cells (Figure 4C).
To further conﬁrm dependence of promoter activation
by DREF on DREs, we measured promoter activities of
all DRE-mutant promoters of both osa and mor genes.
Although we expected that the promoter activities of DRE
mutants would not change in DREF knockdown cells, osa

and mor promoter activities were slightly but signiﬁcantly
decreased in DREFdsRNA-treated cells (Figure 4C).
These results suggest that DREF not only directly but
also indirectly regulates the osa and mor gene transcrip-
tion. It may be possible that some DREF target gene
products activate the osa and mor gene transcription.
DREF binds to the DRE sequence in vitro
Binding of DREF to DRE is essential for transcriptional
activation. We therefore investigated whether DREF has
binding ability to the DRE sequences in the osa and mor
promoter regions by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
32P labeled DRE-containing oligonucleotides were mixed
with DrosophilaKc cell nuclear extracts and DNA–protein
complexes were detected with oligonucleotides containing
osaDRE1 (Figure 5A) or osaDRE2 (Figure 5B). On addi-
tion of non-labeled DRE oliognucleotides as competitors,
shifted bands were diminished (Figure 5A and B). Addition
of a competitor carrying mutations in each DRE did not
aﬀect the complex formation with osaDRE1 and osaDRE2
(Figure 5A and B). The shifted band with osaDRE1 was
decreased by the addition of a 100-fold excess of DRE1mut
competitor, while those with osaDRE2 were not, suggest-
ing the DRE1mut competitor oligonucleotide to possess an
additional DREF-binding site. To conﬁrm that the DRE–
protein complex contains DREF, we added antiDREF

supershifted by addition of antiDREF 4 (2) (Figure 5A and
B). These results indicate that DREF indeed form
complexes with osaDRE1 and osaDRE2.
We also examined whether DREF can bind to DREs of
the mor gene in the similar way. DNA–protein complexes
were detected with the oligonucleotides morDRE1,
morDRE2 and morDRE3 as probes (Figure 6A–C).
Since more nuclear extract was required to detect the
DNA–protein complex with morDRE1, DREF appears to
have lower aﬃnity for morDRE1 than for the others.
Each of the shifted bands disappeared on adding non-
labeled DRE oliognucleotides as competitors, while
competitor oligonucleotides carrying mutations in the
DRE sequences exerted no eﬀect (Figure 6A–C). To
further verify the existence of DREF in the complex with
morDRE oligonucleotides, antiDREF monoclonal anti-
bodies were added to the binding reaction. The addition of
the antiDREF 1 inhibited the complex formation with
morDRE2 and morDRE3 (Figure 6B and C). The shifted
bands with morDRE2 and morDRE3 were supershifted
by adding antiDREF 4 (Figure 6B and C). These results
indicate that DREF form complexes with the oligonucleo-
tides morDRE2 and morDRE3.
Although addition of antiDREF 1 to the binding
reaction only marginally aﬀected the complex formation
with morDRE1, the shifted band was at least partially
supershifted by adding antiDREF 4 (Figure 6A). These
results suggest that not only DREF but also other
protein(s) can form complexes with morDRE1.

examined DREF binding under cellular conditions by
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using aﬃnity
puriﬁed antiDREF polyclonal antibodies. osaDRE1 and
osaDRE2 could be considerably ampliﬁed from the
immunoprecipitates with antiDREF IgG. Ampliﬁcation
of osaDRE1 was 21-fold and that of osaDRE2 was
14-fold compared with ampliﬁcation from the immuno-
precipitates with control IgG, while ampliﬁcation of
Act5C genomic region was only 1.5-fold (Figure 7).
Thus, we concluded that DREF binds to the osaDRE1-
and osaDRE2-containing genomic region in cultured cells.
Ampliﬁcation of the region containing morDRE1 and 2
from the immunoprecipitates with antiDREF IgG was
3.3-fold in comparison with ampliﬁcation of Act5C gene
locus, but morDRE3 was ampliﬁed only 0.9-fold
(Figure 7). We therefore conclude that DREF does not
bind to the genomic region containing morDRE3 in vivo.
It should be noted that morDRE3 matches only six out of
the eight bases canonical DRE and appeared to have only
a weak aﬃnity for DREF in the electrophoretic mobility
shift assay in vitro (Figure 6C).
Knockdown of DREF in S2 cells reduces expression
of several genes encoding components of BRM complexes
In the 50 ﬂanking regions of the genes coding for BAP55,
BAP60 and BAP170, DRE or DRE-like sequences were
found. Although no DRE was found in the 50 ﬂanking
region of brm, its second intron contains three DRE-like
sequences, suggesting that these sequences might act as
enhancer elements. The snr1, BAP111 and polybromo
genes carry no DRE or DRE-like sequences in their
50 ﬂanking regions or introns (Table 1). These ﬁndings
suggest that DREF plays a role in activating the
transcription of several genes encoding subunits of both
BAP and PBAP complexes.
To examine whether DREF aﬀects expression of these
genes, mRNA levels of brm, BAP55, BAP60, snr1,
polybromo and BAP170 in DREF knockdown cells were
measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The brm expression
level in DREFdsRNA-treated cells was reduced to 25%

relative to non-RNAi-treated cells. The mRNA levels for
BAP55 and BAP60 were decreased to 24 and 29%,
respectively (Figure 8A). PBAP-speciﬁc polybromo and
BAP170 were also decreased to 12 and 20%, respectively
(Figure 8A). DREF is assumed to control PBAP expres-
sion as well as BAP. Expression of the snr1 gene was not
aﬀected by knockdown of DREF (Figure 8A).
To investigate whether DREF directly regulates brm,
BAP55, BAP60 and BAP170, we carried out chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays. Genomic regions containing
brmDRE1 (+881 to +874), brmDRE2 (+2208 to+2201)
and brmDRE3 (+7120 to +7113) were not ampliﬁed
from immunoprecipitates with antiDREF IgG
(Figure 8B). It is therefore not likely that these DREs in
the second intron of the brm gene act as enhancer
elements. DRE-containing regions of BAP55, BAP60
and BAP170 were ampliﬁed by 9-, 12- and 18-fold,
respectively (Figure 8B). Therefore, DREF appears to
bind to DREs in these genes and directly activates BAP55,
BAP60 and BAP170 transcription.
It is reported that the OSA-containing BAP complex is
necessary for G2/M progression through string (stg)/
cdc25 promoter activation (17). We therefore examined
mRNA levels of stg in DREF knockdown cells.
Quantitative RT-PCR revealed 80% decrease (Figure 8C).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that both osa and mor are
DREF target genes. Thus osa and mor promoters
exhibited decreased activities when carrying mutations in
their DREs and after knockdown of DREF in cultured
cells. In addition, levels of osa and mor mRNAs were
reduced in DREF knockdown cells. Third, DREF can
bind to DREs of osa and mor in vitro, and binding of
DREF to the genomic regions containing DREs of both
genes was observed in cultured cells. These results showed
that DRE and DREF are important for osa and mor
promoter activation. Promoters having mutations in all
DREs of both osa and mor genes, however, still retained
some activity. It is therefore possible that another
element(s) and/or unknown factor(s) regulated by DREF
are involved in osa and mor transcriptional activation. The
observed rescue of the DREF-induced rough eye pheno-
type by a reduction in the osa and moira gene dosage is
consistent with the idea that the osa and moira gene
transcription is activated by DREF. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the rescue could also be
aﬀected by a mechanism involving protein–protein

interactions between DREF and BAP/PBAP at the
promoters of cell cycle-regulated genes. Further analyses
are necessary to address this point.
Both osa and mor encode components of the BRM
complex (16,29–31), which is a SWI/SNF type ATP-
dependent chromatin remodeling complex conserved from
yeast to human (14), with two forms, BAP and PBAP.
OSA is a signature subunit of BAP, while PBAP contains
Polybromo and BAP170 in its place (16). Localization
patterns of OSA and Polybromo on polytene chromo-
somes diﬀer, though several sites overlap (16). Whole-
genome expression analysis also demonstrated that BAP
and PBAP diﬀerentially regulate gene expression (17). For
example, OSA negatively regulates expression of the
Wingless-target genes and the achaete/scute gene (32,33).
OSA, Polybromo and BAP170 are all required for
function of BRM complex (17). It is thought that OSA
functions in recruitment of BAP to its target genes. MOR,
a subunit common to both BAP and PBAP, is presumed
to be essential for complex integrity, since its absence
results in degradation of both forms (17). SRG3, which is
a homolog of MOR in mammals, also acts for complex
stabilization by protecting against proteasomal degrada-
tion (34). Therefore, OSA and MOR are essential subunits
for function and stabilization of BRM complexes and
DREF may control integrity of the BRM complex
through activating osa and mor gene expression.
BAP and PBAP share seven subunits, BRM, MOR,
Snr1, BAP111, BAP60, BAP55 and Actin (16). BRM is a
catalytic subunit harboring the ATPase domain (35) and it
was previously reported that reduction of the brm gene
dose suppressed the DREF-induced rough eye phenotype
(12). We also found the mRNA level of brm to be
decreased in DREF knockdown cells. However, DRE-like
sequences in the second intron, do not appear to function
as regulatory elements, since DREF does not bind to the
genomic region containing these sites in vivo. DREF may
therefore indirectly control brm gene expression.
The genes coding for BAP55 and BAP60, common
subunits for BAP and PBAP, also contain DRE or DRE-
like sequences in their 50 ﬂanking regions and are aﬀected
by DREF knockdown. DREF binds to the genomic
regions containing their DREs in vivo and it is, therefore,
possible that BAP55 and BAP60 are directly regulated by
DREF. Furthermore, the PBAP-speciﬁc subunit BAP170
carries a DRE in its 50 ﬂanking region. Reduction of
mRNA levels of osa, polybromo and BAP170 in DREF
knockdown cells also is evidence that DREF contributes
to the transcriptional regulation of both BAP and PBAP
complexes. Therefore, DREF may regulate expression of
genes coding for most subunits for both BAP and PBAP
complexes and inﬂuence expression of many genes
through chromatin remodeling.
It is reported that OSA-containing BAP complexes are
necessary for G2/M progression through stg promoter
activation while PBAP complexes are not (17). stg encodes
a CDC25 phosphatase, which is required for G2/M
progression (36). It is well known that DREF predomi-
nantly regulates the transcription of DNA replication-
related genes (1,25,37,38). Reduced stg mRNA has been
reported in DREF-eliminated cells (8) and we also
observed reduction of stg mRNA levels in DREF knock-
down cells, as with brm, osa and mor. In addition to
regulation of S phase entry, DREF thus appears to play
an important role in G2/M transition by activating the
BAP complex to promote cell cycling. We found two
DRE-like sequences in the stg gene upstream region,
219 to 212 (50-aATCGATg) and 591 to 584
(50-TATCGATt). Therefore, DREF could regulate stg
gene expression directly via binding to DRE-like and/or
indirectly via activation of genes coding for BAP
complexes. Further analysis is necessary to distinguish
these possibilities.
BRM complexes are thought to inhibit S phase entry
and mutations of brm, osa and mor suppress the rough eye
phenotype induced by E2F/DP/p35 overexpression (18).
The rough eye phenotype of a cyclin E hypomorphic
mutant was also suppressed by BRM complex mutation
through increase in the S phase (19). Therefore, BRM
complexes appear to negatively regulate S phase entry,
while DREF activates E2F gene transcription and
promotes G1/S progression (39). Although osa is ubiqui-
tously expressed in eye imaginal discs, it is most intensely
expressed anterior to the morphogenic furrow where cells
enter the G1 phase (40). Similarly, DREF is strongly
expressed in this region (12). It is conceivable that DREF
simultaneously activates both positive and negative
regulators of G1/S progression. This kind of regulation
may be necessary for ﬁne tuning of cell cycle progression
to inhibit excess S phase induction.
