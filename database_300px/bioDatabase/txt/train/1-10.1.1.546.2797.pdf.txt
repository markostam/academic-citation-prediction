The anamorphic basidiomycete genus Marchandiomyces presently includes two common lichenicolous (lichen-inhabiting)
species, M. corallinus and M. aurantiacus (teleomorph Marchandiobasidium aurantiacum). We describe here a new species,
M. lignicola sp. nov., that is similar to M. corallinus in the colour of its sclerotia, but diﬀers in having a wood-inhabiting
(lignicolous) habit. The phylogenetic position of this lignicolous fungus was compared with the lichenicolous species of
Marchandiomyces and related species currently placed in the basidiomycetous families Corticiaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae
using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of complete sequences of the nuclear small subunit and internal
transcribed spacers ribosomal DNA, and a portion of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA. These DNA sequences
were obtained from isolated cultures of freshly collected specimens. Signiﬁcant Bayesian posterior probabilities, as well as
maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses, indicate that the new lignicolous species is closely related to M. corallinus,
the type species of Marchandiomyces. In most analyses these two species are monophyletic with the lichenicolous
M. aurantiacus, although this relationship is not strongly supported. Since M. lignicola is more closely related to
M. corallinus than to M. aurantiacus, either a transition to the lignicolous habit occurred recently within an ancestral
lichenicolous group or, more likely, transition to the lichenicolous habit arose recently and in parallel from an ancestral
lignicolous habit.
INTRODUCTION
Fungi, as heterotrophic organisms, have evolved the
ability to degrade and metabolize a diversity of living
and non-living organic substrates. Closely related fungi
may use diﬀerent substrates and distantly related fungi
may use the same substrates, suggesting that evolution-
ary transitions among habits occur continuously.
Despite this evolutionary ﬂexibility, taxonomists have
often emphasized substrate or ‘host ’ habit as a key
character when separating otherwise similar fungi.
Similarities or diﬀerences in habit also have been used
as a predictor of evolutionary trends, transitions, and
relationships. For some habits, such as the licheni-
colous habit where fungi form obligate associations
with lichens, it is diﬃcult to predict evolutionary trends
and relationships. The lichenicolous fungi represent
a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of fungi, but
only a few genera contain both lichenicolous and
non-lichenicolous fungi linked on the basis of their
morphologies. For example, the ascomycete genera
Lichenopeltella and Odontotrema have both lichenico-
lous and non-lichenicolous members. The large genus
Arthonia also includes ecologically diverse species, in-
cluding lichenized, lichenicolous and wood-inhabiting
groups. Nevertheless, most genera with lichenicolous
species are exclusively lichenicolous and some that are
known only as anamorphs (asexual stages) with limited
taxonomic characters are deﬁned at least partly by their
association with lichens. In the absence of strong mor-
phological evidence, it has been uncommon to place
these lichenicolous fungi in genera of mixed ecological
habits. We believe that such mixed genera are of special
interest, however, since they permit an examination of
ﬁne scale evolutionary transitions to and from a licheni-
colous habit.

The most recent survey of these fungi by Lawrey &
Diederich (2003) lists over 1500 known species, with an
estimate of over 3000. More than 95% of these species
are ascomycetous, although a number of distinct ba-
sidiomycetous groups have this habit as well (Sikaroodi
et al. 2001). Lichenicolous fungi form a myriad of
obligate associations where the lichen host is a source
of ﬁxed carbon (Hawksworth 1982a, b, 1988a, b). The
lichen host, itself a symbiosis of fungi and algae or
cyanobacteria, may be clearly and even virulently
parasitized with obvious lesions or discolourations.
In other cases the lichenicolous fungi, relatively non-
aggressive and commensalistic, may cause no apparent
damage to their hosts. Other lichenicolous fungi are
obligately saprophytic and colonize only dead host
tissues. In other cases, ‘ lichenicolous lichens’ may
colonize a particular lichen host and simultaneously
maintain their own algal symbionts.
Several authors have discussed the evolution of the
lichenicolous habit and speculated on possible evol-
utionary trends. Hawksworth (1978, 1982a, b, 1988a, b)
emphasized in numerous publications the reticulate
nature of fungal habits including the lichenicolous
habit, an hypothesis now supported by phylogenetic
reconstructions of transitions among nutritional modes
in major fungal clades of ascomycetous (e.g. Gargas
et al. 1995) and basidiomycetous fungi (e.g. Hibbett,
Gilbert & Donoghue 2000). Lutzoni, Pagel & Reeb
(2001) went so for as to hypothesize that the licheni-
colous habit was for lichenized ascomycetes a ﬁrst step
in loss of the lichen habit. As the latter study proposed
that many major clades of ascomycetes were derived
from lichen-forming fungi, the initial transition from a
lichen-forming to lichenicolous habit would be a criti-
cal one. Since the vast majority of described licheni-
colous fungi are ascomycetes, there is the potential for
repeated evolutionary transitions.
In contrast, the basidiomycetes include few lichens,
but many saprotrophic, parasitic and mutualistic
(mainly mycorrhizal) species. There are also licheni-
colous basidiomycetes from a variety of groups. Our
recent phylogenetic analysis (Sikaroodi et al. 2001)
demonstrated that a small number of morphologically
similar lichenicolous fungi represented at least ﬁve
diverse lineages of fungi, none of which was closely
related to lichen-forming fungi. One of these lineages
included two species of basidiomycete lichenicolous
fungi, Marchandiomyces corallinus and M. aurantiacus
M. corallinus parasitizes a variety of living lichens,
especially members of the Parmeliaceae. This species
is one of the most common lichenicolous fungi in the
eastern USA, where it is locally abundant as a parasite
of the ubiquitous Flavoparmelia baltimorensis. Infected
lichens exhibit obvious coral-coloured sclerotia clus-
tered on the surface of the thallus. The second species,
M. aurantiacus, includes populations similar in appear-
ance to M. corallinus but with lighter orange sclerotia.
Recently Diederich, Schultheis & Blackwell (2003)
described the ceratobasidiales-like teleomorph of this
species as Marchandiobasidium auranticacum. The
anamorph of this species is common in polluted habi-
tats in Europe, where it attacks a variety of lichens,
especially species of Physcia. On the basis of phylo-
genetic analysis of nuclear small subunit (nuSSU)
rDNA, these two species form a clade within a larger
group that contains some representative members of
the basidiomycetous orders Stereales, Poriales, and
‘Aphyllophorales ’, and the ceratobasidialean anamorph
Rhizoctonia zeae (teleomorph Waitea circinata). The
presumed close relationships between Marchandio-
myces and other mitosporic genera (Hobsonia, Illo-
sporium), discussed at various times in the literature
(Lowen et al. 1986), were shown to be erroneous, as
predicted by Etayo & Diederich (1996). It should be
noted that the most recent edition of the Dictionary of
the Fungi (Kirk et al. 2001) says thatMarchandiomyces
is an anamorphic ascomycete, citing Sikaroodi et al.
(2001) ; this is a mistake since we demonstrated an un-
ambiguous basidiomyetous position for Marchandio-
myces.
Recently, non-lichenicolous, apparently lignico-
lous, marchandiomyces-like fungi were discovered in
Virginia (ATCC MYA-299; Sikaroodi et al. 2001).
Since the phylogenetic position of Marchandiomyces
was clearly established in our previous study, we used
similar molecular data to determine if and how these
specimens were related to known Marchandiomyces
species. Depending on the nature of this relationship,
the lignicolous (wood-inhabiting) habit could be either
ancestral or derived relative to the lichenicolous habit.
We collected specimens and produced cultured iso-
lates of the lignicolous marchandiomyces-like fungus
and M. corallinus, and obtained a culture of M. aur-
antiacus from Toen Boekhout (CBS). These cultures
were used to obtain complete nucleotide sequences of
the nuclear small subunit and the internal transcribed
spacer (nuITS) rDNA, and partial sequences of the
nuclear large subunit (nuLSU), information that per-
mitted an examination of the phylogenetic position.
Our objectives were to: (1) determine whether the lig-
nicolous specimens are members of the existing
Marchandiomyces clade; (2) compare all of these
taxa with regard to ecological, anatomical, and
morphological characters; and (3) interpret this non-
lichenicolous habit as derived or ancestral to the
lichenicolous habit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of fungal cultures
Three taxa were chosen for study, Marchandiomyces
corallinus, M. aurantiacus, and the putative lignicolous
Marchandiomyces sp. (ATCC MYA-299 and MYA-
835) (Table 1). All fungal cultures were isolated from
freshly collected material or obtained from collections.
Those cultures isolated in our laboratory were obtained
using the following protocol.
Marchandiomyces lignicola sp. nov. 58
Infected thalli were washed brieﬂy in sterile water,
and sclerotia were removed using a ﬂamed needle.
Some specimens were surface sterilized with ethanol.
Sclerotia were placed on either potato dextrose agar
(PDA) or Sabouraud’s medium with dextrose (SDA),
and mycelial outgrowths were subcultured monthly.
Voucher cultures of new isolates were sent to the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for deposit.
Anatomical studies
Dry herbarium specimens were examined microscopi-
cally with a Zeiss binocular microscope at 40X and 80X
(Diederich 1996). Entire unsectioned sclerotia were
examined in water, KOH, lactophenol Cotton blue
(LCB), Phloxin after KOH-pretreatment, or Congo
red, either without pressure or with slight pressure on
the coverslip to visualize hyphal orientation. Macro-
scopic photographs of sclerotia were prepared using a
specially constructed adapter on a compound micro-
scope (Diederich 1996).
DNA extraction
Total DNA was extracted from each of the cultures
using the TES extraction protocol, modiﬁed from
Grube et al. (1995). Fungal tissue was ground in TES
buﬀer (100 mM Tris, 10mM EDTA, 2% SDS, pH 8.0),
with 1.4 M NaCl and 10% CTAB, and extracted twice
with 1 volume chloroform:isoamyl (24:1). DNA was
precipitated in 0.6 volume of isopropanol with sodium
acetate and then washed with 70–80% ethanol. The
DNA pellet was suspended in 20–30 ml of deionized
water, and the DNA was quantiﬁed by visualizing with
ethidium bromide on a 1% agarose gel.
PCR ampliﬁcation
Dilutions of the DNA stocks were used for PCR am-
pliﬁcations of portions of (A) the nuSSU, (B) nuITS,
and (C) nuLSU. All of the primers used in this study
are the same as those listed in Sikaroodi et al. (2001).
Three regions of nuSSU rDNA were ampliﬁed: (1) the
region between primer nu-SSU-0072-5k, corresponding
to nucleotides 0054 to 0072 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Rubtsov et al. 1980, Mankin, Skryabin & Rubtsov
1986), and primer nu-SSU-0852-3k, nucleotides 0871 to
0852, (2) the region between primer nu-SSU-0819-5k,
nucleotides 0802 to 0819, and primer nu-SSU-1293-3k,
nucleotides 1312 to 1293, and (3) the region between
primer nu-SSU-1203-5k, nucleotides 1184 to1203, and
primer nu-SSU-1750-3k, nucleotides 1769 to 1750. The
nuITS region was ampliﬁed between primer nu-SSU-
1766-5k (ITS5), nucleotides 1744 to 1766, and primer
ITS4, nucleotides 41 to 60 of the nuLSU rDNA of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Georgiev et al. 1981).
These fragments were ampliﬁed from the genomic
DNA (y10 ng) using 1.25 units of Klentaq 1 (Ab
peptides, St Louis, Mo) in 100 ml PCR reactions in a
reaction buﬀer (10 mM Tris pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl and
2 mM MgCl2), with 200 mM of each of the four dNTPs
and 0.5 mM of each primer. The reactions were carried
out in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler for
30–35 cycles with the following conditions for most
of the reactions : template denaturation at 94 xC for
1 min, primer annealing at 50 x for 1 min, and primer
extending at 72 x for 2 min (extended by 5 s in each
cycle). The PCR products were puriﬁed of excess
primers using either of two protocols : (1) by precipi-
tation with 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
2.5 mol Lx1 NaCl, or (2) by ﬁltration through PCR
Wizards (Promega, Madison, WI) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and
size of the PCR ampliﬁcation products were estimated
by comparing them to nucleotide weight and size
markers after agarose gel electrophoresis and staining
with ethidium bromide and exposure to UV light.
DNA sequencing
Double stranded PCR products were sequenced from
each of the ampliﬁcation primers and a number of
internal sequencing primers. Approximately 100 ng of
cleaned products were sequenced from 3.2 pM of primer
using the PRISM Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Ter-
minator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The reaction was carried out in a
Perkin Elmer Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler for 25 cycles
under the following conditions. Template denaturation
was done at 96 x for 30 s, primer annealing at 50 x for
15 s, and primer extension at 60 x for 4 min. The cycle
sequencing products were puriﬁed of excess dye with
ﬁltration through Sephedex G-50 Fine (Pharmacia)
columns, and were run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in
a 373A and 377 Automatic Sequencer (Applied Bio-
systems).

Sequence compiling
Base calling software (Sequencing Analysis, ABI Prism,
2.1.1) was used to produce a preliminary nucleotide
sequence. The nucleotide sequence fragments were
compiled using Sequence Navigator 1.0 (Applied
Biosystems). The sequences were conﬁrmed by com-
parison to sequences produced from the opposite
strand, and altered by manual base calling where
appropriate.
Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum parsimony (MP), PAUP 4.0 (Swoﬀord
1998), was used to produce phylogenetic hypotheses
from the aligned nucleotide sequences, individually for
the three gene regions the nuSSU, nuLSU, and nuITS
rDNA regions, and also in combination. GenBank
sequences from 18 other basidiomycetes representing
14 species were included in the analysis (Table 2).
Two taxa were treated as outgroups for the analysis,
Gloeophyllum sepiarium and Heliocybe sulcata. None
of the characters was excluded, invariant characters
were ignored, and gaps were treated as missing data.
Preliminary analyses treating the gaps as new character
states did not produce diﬀerent topologies. All charac-
ters were weighted equally and branch lengths equal
to zero were collapsed to polytomies. The heuristic
analysis was repeated 100 times using random addition.
Bootstrap percentages were determined from 200 re-
samplings of the data set and Jackknife percentages
from 200 resamplings for the individual gene regions
and from 1000 resamplings for the combined data set.
The gene regions were tested for congruence in a par-
tition homogeneity analysis in PAUP.
For the combined dataset, the equally parsimonious
trees (EPTs) were used as starting trees for a maximum
likelihood (ML) analysis (PAUP 4.0; Swoﬀord 1998)
using the Rogers-Swoﬀord approximation method.
The analysis used the General Time Reversible (GTR)
model assuming six substitution types with ML esti-
mates of the substitution rates and nucleotide fre-
quencies. The among-site rate variation assumed a ML
estimated proportion of invariable sites, and a gamma
distribution of variable sites with a ML estimated
shape. These settings correspond to the GTR+G+I
model, the model selected for the aligned sequences by
MrModeltest 1.1 (Nylander 2002), a simpliﬁed version
of Modeltest (Posada & Crandall 1998). The trees
generated in the MP and ML analyses above were
compared using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests
of topology in PAUP.
Bayesian analysis was performed in MrBayes 3.0b3
(Huelsenback & Ronquist 2001) using a uniform
GTR+G+I model, as selected by Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) in MrModeltest (Nylander 2002):

with base frequencies and substitution rates estimated
in MrModeltest as prior probabilities, were tested
in MrBayes: (1) dirichlet base frequencies and ﬁxed
substitution rates : [GTR+G+I] lset nst=6 rates=
invgamma; prset revmatpr=ﬁxed(0.8847,3.6247,

In the MrBayes analysis, best trees were saved and
examined from every tenth replicate from the over
600 000 replicates in 12 Markov chains, three runs each
of four chains. For the over 60 000 saved trees, xLn
likelihoods were examined for convergence on a stable
likelihood value over the course of each run. Trees
collected before this point were discarded as ‘burnin’
(Huelsenback & Ronquist 2001). From around 7000
trees collected for each of the runs, 700 trees were dis-
carded. The remaining trees (57 906) were used to build
a majority rule consensus tree where the percentage of
the retained ‘best ’ trees supporting a branch represents
the Bayesian posterior probabilities. Bayesian analysis
also found most likely trees that were compared to
those from MP and ML analyses.
RESULTS
Phylogenetic relationships of Marchandiomyces species
In the present study, two collections from the same
locality of an unnamed species of lignicolous fungus
were isolated as axenic cultures and compared with
cultures from each of three collections of the licheni-
colous Marchandiomyces corallinus and one collection
of the lichenicolous M. aurantiacus (Table 1). These
cultures were used for production of nucleotide se-
quences from three nuclear ribosomal gene regions,
nuSSU, nuITS, and nuLSU rDNA. Sequences from
the two lignicolous cultures were almost identical
(>99.8%), as were the three cultures of M. corallinus
(>99.4%). Sequences from 18 basidiomycetous fungi
(Table 2) were selected as potentially related to the
Marchandiomyces cultures on the basis of sequence
similarities in BLAST searches of GenBank and pre-
liminary phylogenetic analyses of the nu LSU rDNA
(data not shown). Although our previous analysis of
nuSSU rDNA sequences (Sikaroodi et al. 2001) sup-
ported the phylogenetic relationship of Marchandio-
myces species to a clade including Rhizoctonia zeae and
Tretopileus sphaerophorus, BLAST searches and pre-
liminary phylogenetic analysis additionally suggested
the relationships of Marchandiomyces to some rep-
resentatives of the families Clavulinaceae, Corticiaceae,
and Hyphodermataceae. Two species, Gloeophyllum
sepiarium of the Gloeophyllaceae and Heliocybe sulcata
of the Polyporaceae, were selected as outgroups for
the analysis. Since sequences from each of the three
regions were not available for all of these taxa and
cultures, available sequences were aligned and unavail-
able gene sequences treated as missing data.
Individually and in combination, the aligned se-
quences of the two ribosomal genes, nuSSU and nuITS,
produced fully congruent phylogenies in parsimony
analysis (partition homogeneity test p=1). However,
aligned sequences from these two gene regions were
partially incongruent with those of the nuLSU (par-
tition homogeneity test p=0.69). Each of the gene
regions contributed between 59 and 204 potentially
informative characters, and in combination 383, for
the matrix of 24 taxa (Table 3). Although the nuITS
had one variable region with ambiguous alignment,
inclusion/exclusion of these positions did not aﬀect
the topology of the tree and they were included in
the ﬁnal analyses. The aligned gene sequences were
subjected to phylogenetic analysis singly and in com-
bination using MP, ML, and Bayesian analyses. When
gaps were treated as missing data, parsimony analysis
found a single most parsimonious tree (MPT) for the
nuSSU, three equally parsimonious trees (EPTs) for
the nuITS, two EPTs for the nu LSU, and 81 EPTs for
the combined analyses of all three genes (Figs 1 & 2).
Treating the gaps as new character states increased
the number of steps but did not change the topologies
of the Marchandiomyces specimens, except for the
nuLSU analysis where M. aurantiacus had diﬀerent
sister taxa relationships (data not shown). ML analysis
of the combined data set using the GTR+G+I model
in PAUP (Swoﬀord 1998) found a tree that was more
likely (xlnL 9982.0316), but not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
on the basis of the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, from
those found in parsimony analysis. However, Bayesian
analysis in MrBayes (Huelsenback & Ronquist 2001)
under the same model with uniform prior probabilities
found a more likely tree (Fig. 3,xlnL 9981.9475), dif-
fering only in the resolution within the sister and basal
clades, that was not signiﬁcantly better than the MP or
ML trees in the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. Bayesian
analysis, pooling trees found from the three diﬀerent
prior probabilities, provided signiﬁcant posterior prob-
abilities (>95%) for all of the branches shared with
the MP topology (Fig. 3).
Parsimony and likelihood analyses of all of the data-
sets agreed on the relationships within theMarchandio-
myces ; the lignicolous specimens formed a sister clade
to the unresolved representatives ofM. corallinus, with
the representative ofM. aurantiacus basal to these taxa
(Figs 1–3). The sister clade relationship of the lignico-
lous specimens and M. corallinus was supported at the
99–100% level in bootstrap, jackknife, and Bayesian
analyses. However, the relationship of M. aurantiacus
to M. corallinus and the lignicolous specimens was
problematic. Although most of the analyses show the
three species of Marchandiomyces as monophyletic
(for example analysis of nuSSU, Fig. 1A), this relation-
ship should be considered ambiguous at this point
P. T. DePriest and others 61
since it is not supported with signiﬁcant Bayesian
posterior probabilities combined with high bootstrap
and jackknife values (Figs 2–3). Only analysis of the
nuITS gene showed signiﬁcant bootstrap (78%) and
jackknife (80%) support for the genus (Fig. 1B).
Analysis of the nuLSU gene produced a polyphyletic
Marchandiomyces in all types of analysis, maximum
parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian
(Fig. 1C–D). In parsimony analysis, only two ad-
ditional steps were required to produce a monophyletic
Marchandiomyces.
In the analysis of nuSSU, nuITS, and the combined
genes, the well supported (Bayesian posterior prob-
ability of 95%, Figs 1A–B, 2–3) sister clade to the
Marchandiomyces included Galzinia incrustans, Treto-
pileus sphaerophorus, and Rhizoctonia zeae and its
teleomorph Waitea circinata. In contrast, the analysis
of nuLSU M. corallinus and the lignicolous march-
andiomyces-like culture were either a sister taxon to
M. aurantiacus and G. incrustans (Fig. 1D, Bayesian
analysis) or to a poorly supported clade of G. incrustans
and some species of the Corticiaceae, Vuilleminia
comedens, Duportella tristicula and Laeticorticium
roseum, with M. aurantiacus basal to this group
(Fig. 1C, maximum parsimony and likelihood analy-
sis). In all analyses except with nuLSU, a poorly sup-
ported clade (Fig. 3, Bayesian posterior probability
27%) or grade was basal to Marchandiomyces and
its Galzinia-Waitea sister clade. Within this assem-
blage three clades had signiﬁcant support : (1) a clade
of Dendrocorticium roseocarenum, D. polygonioides,
Punctularia strigosozonata, and V. cystidiata (Bayesian
posterior probability 100%); (2) a clade of V. comedens
samples (Bayesian posterior probability 100%), and
(3) a clade of Duportella tristicula and Laeticorticium
roseum (Bayesian posterior probability 97%). Clavu-
lina cristata (Clavulinaceae) along with the outgroups
Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Gloeophyllaceae) and Helio-
cybe sulcata (Polyporaceae) were basal to the entire
in-group clade.
Given the strong support (100% Bayesian posterior
probabilities) for a monophyletic relationship be-
tween the lignicolous specimens and Marchandiomyces
corallinus, the type of the genus, and M. aurantiacus,
we describe these specimens as a new species of
Marchandiomyces. Since the lignicolous specimens
were collected from the same locality, are nearly
identical in ribosomal sequences and similar in mor-
phology, we recognize them as members of the single
new species M. lignicola.
Comparison of the known species ofMarchandiomyces
Of the three species of Marchandiomyces, M. lignicola
has much smaller sclerotia (30–50 mm diam, Fig. 6)
than those of M. aurantiacus and M. corallinus. The
sclerotia of M. lignicola and M. corallinus share the
same pinkish colour and are immersed during early
stages of development, while those of M. aurantiacus
are orange and superﬁcial throughout development.
Microscopically, the sclerotia of both M. aurantiacus
and M. corallinus are composed of large, subspherical
to elongate, catenate cells (best seen in squash prep-
arations; Fig. 5), while the cells in M. lignicola are
radiating, branched, typically bi- or trifurcate and api-
cally swollen (Figs 2–5). M. lignicola grows exclusively
on dead wood, while the two other species are virulent
lichen parasites.

DISCUSSION
The genus Marchandiomyces was introduced by
Diederich & Hawksworth (in Diederich 1996) for
the lichenicolous hyphomycete previously known as
Illosporium corallinum. Careful ﬁeld studies and
subsequent examination of type material led Etayo
& Diederich (1996) to accept the existence of at least
two species, M. aurantiacus with orange fruit bodies,
and M. corallinus with pinkish ones. In herbarium
material of both species, the bright colour often dis-
appears within a few years, and their identiﬁcation

then becomes diﬃcult. Lowen et al. (1986) noticed that
Illosporiopsis christiansenii (syn. Hobsonia christian-
senii) has a similar, if not identical, pink pigment as
M. corallinus, and they postulated that both M. cor-
allinus and I. christiansenii might be synanamorphs
of the same fungal species. This was contradicted
by the recent discovery that Marchandiomyces is
basidiomycetous, while I. christiansenii is ascomycetous
(Sikaroodi et al. 2001).M. corallinus has dolipore septa
and septal pore caps similar to those of the Cerato-
basidiales, and M. aurantiacus (teleomorph Marchan-
diobasidium aurantiacum) has basidiomata similar to
those of the ceratobasidialean Waitea (Diederich et al.
2003). Basidiomata observed in previous studies in

an immature stage were incorrectly interpreted as
‘sporodochia’.
On the basis of the present analysis, the three species
of Marchandiomyces were included in a signiﬁcantly-
supported clade comprising representatives of the type
species of Dendrocorticium (D. roseocarneum) and
Duportella (D. tristicula, syn. D. velutina), Laeticorti-
cium (L. roseum),Vuilleminia (V. comedens), andWaitea
(W. circinata), in addition to the type of Marchandio-
myces (M. corallinus). The clade also contained species
placed in genera Galzinia, Tretopileus, and Punctularia.
Many of these genera, Dendrocorticium, Duportella,
Laeticorticium, and Vuilleminia, are members of a
Corticiaceae clade that Hallenberg & Parmasto (1998)
referred to as a ‘suprageneric taxon’. The latter study
also included the species Cytidia salicina in this clade;
however, in our preliminary analyses (data not shown)
the sequence that referred to this species produced
instability in the topology and reduced resolution
within the clade, and it was excluded from our ﬁnal
analyses. On the basis of these analyses, Punctularia
strigosozonata is monophyletic with Dendrocorticium
species and V. cytstidiata. Vuilleminia, as currently
circumscribed, appears polyphyletic as reported in
Hallenberg & Parmasto (1998), with V. cystidiata
phylogenetically separated from V. comedens (the type
of the genus). The members of this ‘supergeneric
taxon’ are lignicolous, with the exception of the herbi-
colous habit of the tropical Duportella tristicula that
is newly derived on the basis of its sister taxon re-
lationship to the lignicolous Laeticorticium roseum.
In contrast to the lignicolous Corticiaceae, the ana-
morph Rhizoctonia zeae and its teleomorph Waitea
circinata are soil-borne saprobes and pathogens of
cereals, turf grasses and legumes, especially causing
sheath spot and root rot of rice and corn. The poly-
phyletic species of Rhizoctonia, characterized by their
common hyphal anatomy, are proposed to have aﬃn-
ities with many diverse families, the basidiomycetous
Ceratobasidiaceae and Corticiaceae, and even the
ascomycetous Otideaceae (Kirk et al. 2001). In this
analysis, R. zeae and W. circinata formed a well-
supported sister clade to the saprobe Tretopileus
sphaerophorus, an anamorph earlier thought to be
ascomycetous, and Galzinia incrustans, a lignicolous
species placed in the Hyphodermataceae. Although the
clade has signiﬁcant posterior probabilities in Bayesian
analysis, 95%, it has ambiguous support in bootstrap
and jackknife analyses (39% in each) and exception-
ally-long internal branch lengths in maximum likeli-
hood phylograms (0.11 substitutions/site ; see Fig. 3).
Waitea, along with Ceratobasidium and Thanate-
phorus were included in the Ceratobasidiales and
Ceratobasidiaceae by Roberts (1999). In contrast, in
our multigene region analyses (results not shown),
Waitea circinata and Rhizoctonia zeae are unrelated
to Ceratobasidium, Thanatephorus, or R. solani, and
not closely related to a clade containing Ganoderma,
Phanerochaete, Spongipellis, and Trichaptum as we
previously proposed with nuSSU data alone (Sikaroodi
et al. 2001). Instead, they have aﬃnities with the
Corticaceae. R. zeae and W. circinata share with the
Marchandiomyces species a pinkish to buﬀ colour in
cultures and sclerotia (as do some Corticiaceae), with
M. corallinus the same dolipore septal ultrastructure,
and with M. aurantiacus (teleomorph Marchandio-
basidium aurantiacum) similar basidiome characters
(Diederich et al. 2003). However, the relative relation-
ships of the three Marchandiomyces species to Waitea,
also suggested by Diederich et al. (2003), and the lig-
nicolous Corticiaceae cannot be resolved at the present
time because nuSSU, nuITS, and nuLSU sequences
are not available from all representatives of these two
groups. Most likely Marchandiomyces, R. zeae, and

Marchandiomyces lignicola sp. nov. 68
Waitea should be placed at least temporarily in the
Corticiaceae as they are not phylogenetically related
(results not shown), or even morphologically similar
(Diederich et al. 2003) to Ceratobasidiaceae as deﬁned
by its type species C. calosporum. However, it is ap-
parent from recent phylogenetic studies (Hibbett &
Thorn 2001, Larsson, Larsson & Ko¨ljalg 2004) that
the corticioid fungi are distributed among many homo-
basidiomycete groups, so the Corticiaceae (and likely
the Ceratobasidiaceae as well) represent grade-level
groupings and not families in a phylogenetic sense.
The new species Marchandiomyces lignicola appears
to be more closely related to M. corallinus than to
M. aurantiacus.M. aurantiacus diﬀers equally in nucleo-
tide substitutions from M. corallinus and M. lignicola,
approximately 6% of the nucleotide positions across
the three gene regions, and its placement in the genus
is not strongly supported in any of the analyses. It is
possible that future sequencing will identify other
fungi that are more closely related to M. aurantiacus,
requiring a new circumscription of the genusMarchan-
diomyces to make it monophyletic. In classical tax-
onomy, M. lignicola would almost surely have been
placed in a diﬀerent genus, based on the above diﬀer-
ences in nutritional mode, morphology, and anatomy.
However, molecular data demonstrate that the habitat
diﬀerences are of a minor taxonomic importance,
and at least M. corallinus and M. lignicola are con-
generic. Originally Marchandiomyces was described as
a lichenicolous genus; now we must amend this con-
cept to include a lignicolous species. All of this illus-
trates the usefulness of molecular data in the taxonomy
of sclerotial fungi that have not yet been connected
to teleomorphic genera. Sclerotia are not always
reliable taxonomic characters at the genus level since
sclerotia of non-related species might be quite similar,
while those of closely related species can be very
diﬀerent.
In Marchandiomyces, either the lichenicolous habit
arose in parallel in M. aurantiacus and M. corallinus,
or it was lost in the M. lignicola lineage. When lichen-
icolous and lignicolous habits are mapped onto the
phylogeny, the lignicolous one is observed in all sister
clades to be the ancestral state (Fig. 3). With parsimony
reconstructions using accelerated transformation
(ACCTRAN) or delayed transformation (DELTRAN)
character-state optimization or any ML reconstruc-
tion, the lichenicolous habit appears to have been
gained independently in M. corallinus and M. auran-
tiacus. Nonetheless, phylogenetic analysis alone is
insuﬃcient to determine whether or not the lichenico-
lous habit, or even pre-adaptation to the lichenicolous
habit, was a shared characteristic inMarchandiomyces.
It would be of interest to determine if diﬀerences in cell
wall-degrading enzymes or tolerance of lichen extrolites
help to explain ecological diﬀerences among the three
species. However, since the two substrates are so dif-
ferent, modiﬁcation of degradative enzymes would
have had to take place in either case.
The apparent transitions between lignicolous and
lichenicolous habits, and among lignicolous and
saprobic/phytopathogenic or herbicolous habits, dem-
onstrates the evolutionary ﬂexibility of nutritional
modes in these fungi. There would appear to be limit-
less opportunities for such transitions. In the case of
the basidiomycete groupMarchandiomyces, the lichen-
icolous habit most likely arose from a lignicolous
ancestor more than once, and may in the future give
rise to the lignicolous habit again. Therefore, it would
appear that a lichenicolous habit is but one of many
ecological habits repeatedly explored by opportunistic
fungi.
