ABSTRACT
In the elucidation of the microRNA regulatory net-
work, knowledge of potential targets is of highest
importance. Among existing target prediction
methods, RNAhybrid [M. Rehmsmeier, P. Steffen,
M. Ho¨chsmann and R. Giegerich (2004) RNA, 10,
1507–1517] is unique in offering a flexible online pre-
diction. Recently, some useful features have been
added, among these the possibility to disallow G:U
base pairs in the seed region, and a seed-match
speed-up, which accelerates the program by a factor
of 8. In addition, the program can now be used as a
webservice for remote calls from user-implemented
programs. We demonstrate RNAhybrid’s flexibility
with the prediction of a non-canonical target site for
Caenorhabditis elegans miR-241 in the 30-untrans-
lated region of lin-39. RNAhybrid is available at
http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid.
INTRODUCTION
microRNAs (miRNAs) are 19–24 nt long RNAs that post-
transcriptionally silence their target genes by binding to the
target mRNAs (1,2). Upon near-perfect hybridization around
the middle of the miRNA/target duplex, the target is cleaved
and subsequently degraded. With less tight hybridizations, the
target can be degraded or blocked from translation. miRNAs
are key players in important cellular activities such as pro-
liferation, morphogenesis, apoptosis and differentiation (3).
Besides an investigation of the mechanistic aspects of miRNA
silencing, the elucidation of the miRNA regulatory network is
a major challenge. With that, knowledge of potential targets is
of highest importance. For human, more than 300 miRNAs
have experimental support (4), with at least 800 being sus-
pected (5). The total number of targeted genes is estimated to
be one-third of the whole human gene complement, 10 000
genes (6). In stark contrast is the current number of experi-
mentally validated targets, which according to the Diana
TarBase is 55 for human (7). For fly, the situation is slightly
better with a reported number of 75 validated targets. A
number of prediction methods have contributed to a large
extent in the generation of interesting hypotheses about pos-
sible miRNA/target relationships (6,8–16). Here we review
RNAhybrid (16) which among these methods is unique in
offering a flexible online prediction. The RNAhybrid online
version is used well over 1000 times per month. In Ref. (16),
it was shown that RNAhybrid predicts bona fide targets in
Drosophila melanogaster at high specificity. Among these
targets were the proapoptotic genes grim, reaper and sickle,
where sickle had not been predicted previously, but was
experimentally tested because of its functional context with
grim and reaper. Recently, some useful features have been
added to RNAhybrid, among these the possibility to disallow
G:U base pairs in the seed region, and a seed-match speed-up,
which accelerates the program by a factor of 8. The program
can now also be used as a webservice for remote calls from
user-implemented programs, thus eliminating the need for a
local installation. RNAhybrid is available at http://bibiserv.
techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid. Researchers who use
RNAhybrid are asked to cite this article and Ref. (16).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Algorithmic core
The algorithmic core of RNAhybrid is a variation of the classic
RNA secondary structure prediction (17). Instead of a single
sequence that is folded back onto itself in the energetically
most favourable fashion, RNAhybrid determines the most
favourable hybridization site between two sequences. Though
in principle these two sequences can be arbitrarily long, for
microRNA target prediction, the target candidate will be rather
long (hundreds to thousands of nucleotides) and the miRNA
will be between 19 and 24 nt. Since microRNA/target inter-
actions have not been reported to contain bifurcations (also
called multi-loops), these are not considered by RNAhybrid,
thus considerably increasing the speed of the algorithm.
RNAhybrid does not use any RNA folding or pairwise
sequence alignment code, but implements an algorithm that
was specifically designed for RNA hybridization [see also (16)].

Features of the online version
The online version of RNAhybrid is an easy-to-use web inter-
face in which the user can upload his or her own miRNA and
candidate target sequences. A number of options give broad
control over the kind of interaction the program looks for. A
prevailing assumption about functional miRNA/target inter-
actions is the necessity of a ‘seed’ (6), a perfect Watson–Crick
match between miRNA and target at miRNA positions
2–7 or 8. However, experimentally validated miRNA/target
duplexes in Caenorhabditis elegans appear to have unpaired
nucleotides in this very seed region (18). In (11), it was
experimentally shown that a target site with a seed region as
small as only 4 nt can be functional as long as there is a
compensatory hybridization at the miRNA 30 end. RNAhybrid
answers this heterogeneity by allowing the user to freely
choose the (algorithmic) necessity and nature of a seed. First,
the position and length of the seed can be defined; second, G:U
wobble base pairs with the seed may be allowed or not and
third, the request for a seed in the prediction can be refrained
from altogether. The disallowance of G:U pairs in the seed is
one of the new features and has been requested frequently.
Another novelty is a ‘seed-match speed-up’, in which in an

initial filter step, candidate targets are searched for seed
matches, only upon finding such matches the complete hybrid-
ization around the seed-match is calculated. For non-G:U
seeds of length 6, this implements a speed-up of a factor of
8. Another new option is to restrict possible sizes of unpaired
regions, the loops. Both ‘bulge loops’, those with unpaired
nucleotides on only one side, and ‘internal loops’, those with
unpaired nucleotides on both sides, can be restricted in their
length to user-defined values. This is especially useful in the
prediction of plant miRNA targets. These targets usually
exhibit only a small number of unpaired nucleotides, if any
(8). Restricting loop sizes to, for example 1 nt, avoids the
generation of spurious hits that do not conform to established
miRNA/target hybridization rules in plants. Two other useful
options are the number of target sites per miRNA and target
candidate the program looks for, and a threshold for the mini-
mum free energy of the hybridization, only below which target
sites are reported. This latter option is the only option that is
offered by Diana microT (15), in turn the only method besides
RNAhybrid that is available for online miRNA target predic-
tion in animals. The program miRU (19) is available as an
online tool, but is geared towards prediction of potential tar-
gets in plants.
RNAhybrid webservice
A new technology for invoking programs on remote computers
are webservices. Providing access using webservices makes
it possible to use the programs from local computers and
compute results remotely without technical knowledge of the
programs. In addition to the traditional browser/HTML-based
web-interface, we also offer a webservice interface for using
RNAhybrid in a batch job enviroment or from another, user-
developed program. All options of the traditional sub-
mission form are supported by the webservice version. The
RNAhybrid webservice is asynchronous and implements the
request and response with a polling technique (Adams, H.,
Asynchronous operations and webservice, http://www-106.
ibm.com/developerworks/library/wsasync1/) that follows the
HOBIT standard for exchanging status information between
client and server (HOBIT, Helmholtz Open Bioinformatics
Technology, http://hobit.sourceforge.net). Users can create
their own webservices client by using a webservice frame-
work. Well-known webservice frameworks are SOAP::Lite
(Perl) (a simple and lightweight interface to SOAP, http://
soaplite.com/), AXIS (webservice framework for Java and
C/C++, http://ws.apache.org/axis), gSOAP (C/C++ webser-
vices and clients, http://gsoap2.sourceforge.net) and .NET
(Microsoft .Net framework, http://www.microsoft.com/net/).
Sample clients for Perl/SOAP::Lite and Java/Axis are avail-
able on the RNAhybrid homepage. A simple client that uses
the Perl programming language with SOAP::Lite is shown
in Table 1.
RESULTS
In C.elegans, members of the let-7 family of miRNAs, which
comprises the miRNAs let-7, miR-48, miR-84 and miR-241,
function in combination to affect early and late developmental
timing decisions (20). miR-48, miR-84 and miR-241 control
the L2-to-L3 transition, probably by binding to the hbl-1 30-
untranslated region (30-UTR). lin-41, which acts redundantly
with hbl-1 in the regulation of the L4-to-adult transition, is
repressed by let-7, but probably not by miR-48, miR-84 and
miR-241. It is suggested in (20) and has been so before in (11)
that the target specificity of these miRNAs might be defined by
their 30-sequence. While the 50-sequence from nucleotides 1 to
8 is identical in all four miRNAs, the 30-part exhibits strong
sequence diversity (see Table 2). Since lin-41 lacks binding
sites for the 50-seed, the existence of let-7/lin-41 target sites
does not automatically give rise to miR-48, miR-84 and
miR-241 sites. In fact, let-7 is the only probable regulator
of lin-41, and this regulation is mediated by an extended
30-complementarity (18). In Ref. (20), Ambros and colleagues
speculate that there might be genes that are specifically tar-
geted by miR-48, miR-84 or miR-241. To test this hypothesis,
we analysed the 30-UTRs of 33 lin (abnormal cell LINeage)
genes, downloaded from the Ensembl database (http://www.
ensembl.org), for target sites with extended 30-complemen-
tarity to the members of the let-7 family. 30-complementarity
was enforced by requiring a ‘seed’ from nucleotides 12 to 18,
not allowing G:U base pairs. In addition to the expected let-7/
lin-41 target sites, we found a strong hit for miR-241 in the
lin-39 30-UTR (see Table 3). lin-39 encodes a homeodomain
protein homologous to the Deformed and Sex combs reduced
family of homeodomain proteins and is required for the
specification of, among others, vulval precursor cells (21).
A weaker match (data not shown) for miR-241 was found
in the 30-UTR of lin-45, which is required for, among others,
the induction of vulval cell fates (22). In Caenorhabditis
briggsae, we predict a potential binding site for miR-241 in
lin-39, though not in the same position and of a weaker quality
than in C.elegans (see also Table 3).
DISCUSSION
RNAhybrid is a tool for the easy, fast and flexible prediction of
microRNA targets. Besides Diana microT and miRU, it is the
only method available as an online tool. At the same time,
RNAhybrid offers a larger choice of options and applications.
As an example, we analysed the 30-UTRs of 33 C.elegans lin
(abnormal cell LINeage) genes for potential non-canonical
target sites for any of the four C.elegans let-7 microRNA
family members. Extensive 30-pairing was enforced by requir-
ing RNAhybrid to form ‘seed’ matches at nucleotides 12–18
in the miRNA, disallowing G:U basepairs. The analysis res-
ulted in the prediction of lin-39 as a strong target candidate
for miR-241. This finding supports suggestions about target
specificity that is defined by 30-complementarity (11,20).
The unusual choice of the ‘seed’ position demonstrates
RNAhybrid’s flexibility. While the classic seed assumption
(nucleotides 2–7 or 8) increases the statistical significance
of target predictions in genome-wide analyses [see eg.
(6,11,16)], one might miss bona fide target sites that do not

show this seed, as is already suggested by let-7 and lin-4 target
sites in C.elegans which have bulging nucleotides in the seed
region (18). Also, Stark et al. (11) have experimentally
demonstrated that short ‘seeds’ of 4 nt can be compensated
by 30-complementarity. In fact, lin-39 has not been predicted
as a target of miR-241 by any of the standard target prediction
approaches [PicTar (13), TargetScanS (6), MiRanda (4)],
presumably because these methods, to various extents,
rely on the presence of classic seed matches (miRanda does
this indirectly by favouring 50-matching). It should be fruitful
in the future to perform genome-wide predictions of
non-canonical target sites.
