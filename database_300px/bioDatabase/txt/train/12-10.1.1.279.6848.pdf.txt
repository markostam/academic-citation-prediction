ABSTRACT
Polyadenylation of nascent transcripts is one of
the key mRNA processing events in eukaryotic cells.
A large number of human and mouse genes have
alternative polyadenylation sites, or poly(A) sites,
leading to mRNA variants with different protein
products and/or 30-untranslated regions (30-UTRs).
PolyA_DB 2 contains poly(A) sites identified for
genes in several vertebrate species, including human,
mouse, rat, chicken and zebrafish, using alignments
between cDNA/ESTs and genome sequences. Several
new features have been added to the database since
its last release, including syntenic genome regions
for human poly(A) sites in seven other vertebrates
and cis-element information adjacent to poly(A) sites.
Trace sequences are used to provide additional evi-
dence for poly(A/T) tails in cDNA/ESTs. The updated
database is intended to broaden poly(A) site cover-
age in vertebrate genomes, and provide means to
assess the authenticity of poly(A) sites identified by
bioinformatics. The URL for this database is http://
polya.umdnj.edu/PolyA_DB2.
INTRODUCTION
Polyadenylation of nascent transcripts is an essential step for
all mRNAs in eukaryotic cells, with the exception of some
histone transcripts (1,2). The process is coupled with other
steps of mRNA processing, such as termination of transcrip-
tion and splicing (3,4), and involves two reactions (5,6): an
endonucleolytic cleavage of a nascent mRNA, followed by
polymerization of an adenosine tail at the 30 end of the
mRNA to a length specific to the species, e.g. 200–250 nt
in mammals and 70–90 nt in yeasts. The poly(A) tail is
critical for many aspects of mRNA metabolism, including
mRNA stability, translation and transport (7,8). A number
of cis-regulatory elements, or cis-elements, have been found
or suggested to play roles in polyadenylation [(9) and refer-
ences therein]. The most prominent elements in mammals
are the Polyadenylation Signal (PAS) located within 40 nt
upstream of the cleavage site, including AAUAAA,
AUUAAA, and their variants, and the U/GU-rich elements
located within 40 nt downstream of the cleavage site.
Cis-element information can be used to computationally pre-
dict poly(A) sites with high sensitivity and selectivity (10).
Recently, polyadenylation has been implicated in the
degradation of some nuclear RNAs in eukaryotic cells by
the exosome (11). The polyadenylation reaction in this
process appears to involve a distinct set of factors than
those responsible for polyadenylation of nascent transcripts,
and the resulting poly(A) tail is usually short and contains
variable nucleotides (12).
Over half of all human genes have alternative poly(A)
sites, with locations in internal exons, introns and 30-most
exons (13,14), leading to transcript variants with different
open reading frames and/or variable 30-untranslated regions
(30-UTRs). Thus, alternative polyadenylation significantly
contributes to the overall complexity of mRNA pool in the
cell. A growing number of alternative polyadenylation events
have been shown to regulate gene function in a tissue-specific
manner (15,16). Bioinformatic techniques using cDNA
sequences and Expressed Sequenced Tags (ESTs) offer a
systematic approach to identify poly(A) sites in genomes
(13,14,17–20). PolyA_DB 2 is a database designed to catalog
poly(A) sites in all genes of major vertebrate species. Poly(A)
sites are identified by aligning cDNA/ESTs with genome
sequences. Several types of information are available in the
database and can be retrieved and presented in Views, includ-
ing intron/exon structure, poly(A) site location, supporting
cDNA/ESTs, ortholog groups across human, mouse, rat and
chicken, PAS types and positions, locations of various cis-
elements, cDNA library information, and syntenic sequences
across eight vertebrates. In addition, Trace sequences are
used, when available, to further support the poly(A/T) tails
in cDNA/ESTs. These data not only provide comprehensive
information for poly(A) sites in several vertebrate species,
but also allow researchers to assess the authenticity of

poly(A) sites identified by bioinformatics. This database can
be of great value to those interested in studying the mecha-
nism of polyadenylation as well as gene regulation involving
alternative polyadenylation.
METHODS
Identification of poly(A) sites in genomes using
cDNA/ESTs and Trace sequences
We retrieved all cDNA/EST sequences listed in human,
mouse, rat, chicken and zebrafish UniGene databases from
NCBI (July and August 2005 versions), and aligned them
with genome sequences downloaded from the UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics Site (http://genome.ucsc.edu, hg17 for human,
mm5 for mouse, rn3 for rat, galGal2 for chicken and danRer1
for zebrafish) using BLAT (21). Poly(A) sites were identified
by parsing dangling ends of the alignments using the method
described in (13). All internal priming candidates were dis-
carded. Human, mouse, rat and zebrafish Trace sequences
were downloaded from NCBI Trace Archive and were used
to extend terminal poly(A/T) sequences in cDNA/ESTs as
described in (22).
Grouping poly(A) sites according to locations and genes
We grouped together poly(A) sites belonging to the same
gene using NCBI UniGene database. To eliminate anti-
sense transcripts and other erroneous transcripts, we cleaned
up UniGene Bins (or Clusters) as shown in Supplementry
Figure 1. The cleaned UniGene Bins are called CLUBs
(CLeaned UniGene Bin). This step was carried out first by
selecting a representative sequence called initiator for the
CLUB, followed by iteratively including cDNA/ESTs that
have the same transcriptional orientation as the initiator and
have sequence overlap with cDNA/ESTs already in the
CLUB. Initiators were selected based on the order RefSeqs
> other cDNAs > ESTs. Sequences included in a CLUB are
called CLUB members. One UniGene Bin may have more
than one CLUB. To maximize the number of supporting
cDNA/EST sequences for a poly(A) site, the 30 ends of
sequences without poly(A/T) tails were compared with iden-
tified poly(A) sites. An cDNA/EST is considered to be sup-
porting a poly(A) site if its 30 end is near the poly(A) site
within 24 nt. Transcripts with unknown transcriptional ori-
entation are assigned as associated CLUB members if one
of their sequence ends is near a poly(A) site within 24 nt,
and the inferred transcriptional orientation based on the
poly(A) site does not conflict with that of the CLUB. They
were also included as supporting cDNA/ESTs. Poly(A) sites
that are located within 24 nt from one another, due to hetero-
geneous cleavage, were iteratively clustered together in the
50 to 30 direction. The position of the middle cleavage site in
a cluster is used to represent the cluster. Thus, in PolyA_DB
2, poly(A) site ID is composed of three parts, i.e. UniGene
ID, CLUB number, and site number. For example,
Hs.44402.1.46 is based on UniGene ID Hs.44402, CLUB
number 1, and site number 46. Gene information was
retrieved from NCBI Gene databases (August 2005 versions)
and assigned to CLUBs based on the relationship between
Gene IDs and RefSeq sequences in the CLUBs.
Annotation of cis-elements
We used position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) of
previously identified 15 cis-elements to search poly(A)
regions (9). For each matrix we derived all possible positive
scores for matching a sequence with the same size. The 25th,
50th and 75th percentiles were used to benchmark other
sequence matches. For all sequences surrounding human
and mouse poly(A) sites, we compared their matching scores
with the benchmarks. A match was considered ‘very strong’
if its score was above the 75th percentile; ‘strong’ for the
50th–75th percentile; ‘weak’ for the 25th–50th percentile;
‘very weak’ for below the 25th percentile; and ‘no match’
for negative scores.
Finding syntenic regions for human poly(A) sites
We used the eight-way genome alignments from the UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics Site to obtain syntenic regions for
human poly(A) sites. The eight-way genome alignment files
contain genomes of Homo sapiens (human), Pan troglodytes
(chimpanzee), Canis familiaris (dog), Mus musculus (mouse),
Rattus norvegicus (rat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Danio rerio
(zebrafish) and Takifugu rubripes (puffer fish). We first
parsed out the alignment blocks overlapping the 300 to
+300 nt region surrounding human poly(A) sites and identi-
fied corresponding positions in other genomes if they had
sequences aligned with the region. We then retrieved
genomic sequences from all aligning species, including
human, and re-aligned the sequences with CLUSTALW
(23). We also annotated all cDNA/ESTs from the aligning
species whose sequence ends are located within 24 nt from
human poly(A) sites in the alignments. This information
can support conservation of poly(A) sites.
Database and website
Data in the database are stored in a relational database,
implemented with MySQL. PHP and Perl are used for the
web interface. Bioperl modules are used for graphical repres-
entation of sequences (24). Queries are based on Gene IDs,
UniGene IDs, CLUB IDs and Site IDs. Large batch down-
loads are available upon request.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As of September 2006, PolyA_DB 2 contains 54 686 human,
30 235 mouse, 26 602 rat, 6287 chicken, and 5830 zebrafish
poly(A) sites (Table 1). Various types of information regard-
ing poly(A) sites and their corresponding genes are available
and are presented in Views. We have updated several Views
reported in the last release (25), such as Gene View, cDNA/
EST evidence View, Ortholog View, PAS View and Library
View (see the online help file for details), and have added
several new Views.
Site View
Site View contains information about individual poly(A)
sites. Each poly(A) site has an ID as described above. Its
corresponding Gene ID, Chromosome number, and position
on the chromosome are indicated. Since each site may have
several cleavage sites, the left-most and right-most cleavage
D166 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue
locations, as well as number of cleavage sites are provided.
The maximum length of poly(A/T) tail based on all support-
ing cDNA/ESTs, and additional tail length from Trace
sequences are listed, which can help determine the authentic-
ity of a poly(A) site (see below). In addition, supporting
cDNA/ESTs and the genomic sequence 125 to +125 nt
flanking each site are provided.
cis-Element View
The 125 to +125 nt region of a poly(A) site is searched for
15 elements identified by a bioinformatic method described in
(9). Matches with cis-elements are divided into five cate-
gories as described in Methods.
Synteny View
For each human poly(A) site, a multiple genome alignment of
eight vertebrate species is presented (see Methods for details).
PolyA_DB 2 is designed to provide higher poly(A) coverage
in more species than the previous release (25). In addition,
new features are included to help researchers assess the
authenticity of poly(A) sites identified by bioinformatics.
Major sources for false identification of poly(A) sites include
(i) internal priming of poly(A)-rich sequences within mRNAs
(26) and (ii) polyadenylation of mRNAs marked for degra-
dation by the exosome (11,12). We have taken rigorous
measures to eliminate internally primed cDNA/ESTs (22),
and thus its effect should be minimal, if any. Polyadenylated
mRNAs marked for degradation can potentially lead to false
identification of poly(A) sites. Their poly(A) tails, however,
appear to be shorter than those added by the polyadenylation
process for nascent transcripts. Given that most oligo(dT)
primers are 15–20 nt, long poly(A/T) tails in cDNA/
ESTs, e.g. >30 nt, can be considered to be derived from
poly(A) tails made by the polyadenylation process for nascent
transcripts. In this regard, additional poly(A/T) sequences
from the Trace database are highly valuable for the selectivity
of poly(A) site identification. These sequences are usually
removed from cDNA/ESTs due to low quality of sequence
or low complexity of sequence. Other types of information
can also provide circumstantial evidence as to the authentic-
ity of a poly(A) site: (i) large number of cDNA/ESTs; (ii)
several cleavage sites for a poly(A) site; (iii) presence of
canonical PAS, i.e. AAUAAA or AUUAAA; (iv) presence
of other cis-elements for polyadenylation and (v) high
sequence conservation in syntenic regions in other species.
All these are available in PolyA_DB 2.
