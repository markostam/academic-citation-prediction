ABSTRACT
The Molecular INTeraction database (MINT, http://
mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint/) aims at storing, in a
structured format, information about molecular
interactions (MIs) by extracting experimental details
from work published in peer-reviewed journals. At
present the MINT team focuses the curation work
on physical interactions between proteins. Genetic
or computationally inferred interactions are not
included in the database. Over the past four years
MINT has undergone extensive revision. The new
version of MINT is based on a completely remodeled
database structure, which offers more efficient data
exploration and analysis, and is characterized by
entries with a richer annotation. Over the past few
years the number of curated physical interactions
has soared to over 95 000. The whole dataset can be
freely accessed online in both interactive and batch
modes through web-based interfaces and an FTP
server. MINT now includes, as an integrated addi-
tion, HomoMINT, a database of interactions between
human proteins inferred from experiments with
ortholog proteins in model organisms (http://mint.
bio.uniroma2.it/mint/).
INTRODUCTION
Cells are complex systems whose physiology is governed by
an intricate network of molecular interactions (MIs) of which
a relevant subset are protein–protein interactions (PPIs).
Signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulation
are typical examples of such biological processes mediated
by PPI.
The MI database (MINT, http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint/)
was designed to collect experimentally verified PPIs in a
binary or complex representation.
Over the past four years, MINT has undergone a profound
reorganization of both the data model and the database struc-
ture, and has dramatically increased the number of stored
interactions.
DATABASE STRUCTURE
In January 2006, MINT adopted the IntAct relational model.
IntAct is an open source database designed for the storage,
presentation and analysis of MIs (1) (schema available at
http://intact.sourceforge.net/uml/intactCore.gif). The main
advantages of adopting the IntAct model lie in its ability to
represent protein complexes and other types of molecules
as interaction participants, and in the ease with which new
features and toolkits for data storage, representation and
analysis can be added. In addition MINT, from now on,
will be compatible with all the upgrades and tools developed
by the IntAct consortium. MINT is based on the open source
PostgreSQL database management system (http://www.
postgresql.org). All the data can be accessed as Java objects
through the IntAct API by using OJB (http://db.apache.org/
ojb/) as the object-relational mapping tool. The web applica-
tion is based on the Struts framework (http://jakarta.apache.
org/struts/) running on the Tomcat servlet container (http://
tomcat.apache.org/) and the Apache server (http://www.
apache.org/).
DATA GROWTH
Since MINT was first reported (2) the number of curated
entries has grown significantly. Given the new database struc-
ture, binary and n-ary interactions can now be represented.
The number of binary interactions has increased >20-fold
(Figure 1). As of September 2006, more then 95 000 physical
interactions involving 27 461 proteins from 325 organisms
are stored in MINT (Figure 2). Although, 90% of the inter-
actions stored in the database are the result of large scale,
genome wide experiments, the value of MINT resides in
the high number of curated articles, each of which reports a
small number of interactions. This is reflected in the steady
increase of curated articles that is mainly due to the curation
of publications describing low-throughput experiments
(Figure 1). The MINT curation team consists of two full-
time and one part-time curators. This is not sufficient to
capture all the interaction information steadily reported in
research articles. Thus, we have chosen to focus our efforts
on consistently curating all the issues of FEBS Letters
(since January 2005) and EMBO Journal and EMBO Reports

(since January 2006). This choice was made in agreement
with the other members of the International Molecular-
Interaction Exchange consortium (IMEx http://imex.
sourceforge.net/), including DIP (3), IntAct (1), MPact (4)
and BIND (5). IMEx aims at avoiding work overlaps, at shar-
ing the curation workload and at exchanging completed
records on MI data.
DATABASE CURATION
Since January 2006, the syntax and the semantics for data
representation have been provided by the Proteomics Stan-
dards Initiative-Molecular Interaction (PSI-MI 2.5) standards.
The PSI workgroup develops and maintains a common data
standard allowing users to retrieve all relevant data from dif-
ferent data providers and to perform comparative analysis (6).
Each stored interaction represents, according to the PSI-MI
standards, a physical interaction, a direct interaction or a co-
localization. All the database records created before January
2005 underwent a drastic quality control performed by the
new MINT curation staff composed of PhD level curators.
All the previous entries were re-curated according to the
new PSI-MI standard. Entries that could not be updated
according to PSI-MI standards were deleted from the data-
base in order to maintain a high quality dataset. The MINT
Curation Reference Manual is being developed in collabora-
tion with the other IMEx partners and is available at http://
imex.sourceforge.net/doc/imex-curationManual.doc. The new
data submission HTML forms benefit from an improved
automatic check based on curation rules. This ensures that
mandatory fields are filled and that annotated ranges or
residues are consistent with the protein length reported by
Uniprot. In addition, for the purpose of ensuring high fidelity
annotation, every new entry derived from low-throughput
experiments undergoes a further validation step performed
by a different curator before release to the public.
DATA ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION
The new web-based interface includes a number of improve-
ments and enhancements allowing a more efficient database
exploration. Most notably, the query can be based on protein
Figure 1. Mint growth. The graph on the left represents the growth in the number of interactions stored in MINT. The right graph represents the corresponding
growth in the number of curated articles.

or gene names, UniProt keywords or identifiers of external
databases: UniProtKB, PDB, Ensembl, FlyBase, SGD,
WormBase, OMIM, HUGE, PubMed and Reactome. It is also
possible to query species specific datasets (mammalian,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caemorhabaditis elegans, Droso-
phila melanogaster, viruses). Finally, a sequence similarity
search (BLAST) can also be performed to search for proteins
which are homologous to the query protein.
The query results are displayed in a table showing in the
left frame a summary of the protein features reported in Uni-
Prot and, in the right frame, the list of the interaction partners
curated in MINT. The interactions can be displayed graphi-
cally by an enhanced version of the ‘MINT viewer’, a Java
applet derived from the applet Graph (http://java.sun.com).
The viewer represents the interactions by lines (edges) and
nodes (proteins), and assigns the nodes a size proportional
to the protein’s molecular weight and a color which depends
on the species. The graph displayed by the viewer can be
expanded and edited interactively by moving or deleting
nodes. Proteins linked to OMIM are now highlighted in
red. In order to attribute a reliability index to the reported
interactions, we have also assigned each interaction a confi-
dence level, based on the experimental detection method
and experimental conditions. The results of the analysis
performed in the MINT viewer can be captured in different
formats ready for export: PSI1.0-XML, PSI2.5-XML, flat-
file, Osprey.
MINT is now also complemented by HomoMINT (7), an
inferred human protein interaction network where inter-
actions discovered in model organisms (and collected in
MINT) are mapped onto the corresponding human orthologs.
Through the MINT web pages it is also possible to search
the HomoMINT dataset for inferred interactions.
A web service allows direct computational access so as
to freely retrieve interaction networks in different formats:
flat-file, PSI1.0-XML, PSI2.5-XML. It is also possible to
download specific subsets of the database based on the
taxonomy of the interactors.
