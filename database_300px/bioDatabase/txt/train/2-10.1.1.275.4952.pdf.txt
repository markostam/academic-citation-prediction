ABSTRACT
MolAxis is a freely available, easy-to-use web server
for identification of channels that connect buried
cavities to the outside of macromolecules and
for transmembrane (TM) channels in proteins.
Biological channels are essential for physiological
processes such as electrolyte and metabolite trans-
port across membranes and enzyme catalysis, and
can play a role in substrate specificity. Motivated by
the importance of channel identification in macro-
molecules, we developed the MolAxis server.
MolAxis implements state-of-the-art, accurate
computational-geometry techniques that reduce
the dimensions of the channel finding problem,
rendering the algorithm extremely efficient. Given a
protein or nucleic acid structure in the PDB format,
the server outputs all possible channels that con-
nect buried cavities to the outside of the protein or
points to the main channel in TM proteins. For each
channel, the gating residues and the narrowest
radius termed ‘bottleneck’ are also given along
with a full list of the lining residues and the channel
surface in a 3D graphical representation. The users
can manipulate advanced parameters and direct the
channel search according to their needs. MolAxis is
available as a web server or as a stand-alone
program at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MolAxis.
INTRODUCTION
Channels in proteins are putative sites for binding,
conducting ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, peptides
and water. In enzymes, substrate speciﬁcity is deﬁned not
only by interactions at the binding site but also by the
selectivity of the substrate by the pathways leading to the
active site. This selectivity is a function of the pathway
geometry and chemical properties. Predicting and better
understanding of pathways in macromolecules are critical
issues in biology and chemistry, and in rational drug
design. The major goal in channel ﬁnding is to detect all
possible distinct channels, their dimensions including their
length, narrowest radius (termed bottleneck) and gating
residues taking into account the global geometry of the
macromolecule. Most of the earlier algorithms (1–8) were
developed to ﬁnd functional sites such as binding sites on
the surface of a protein or in buried areas of proteins.
However, the pathway to the active site was neglected.
Voids and chamber ﬁnding algorithms are rather limited
in their ability to detect the pathways of ligands to the
active site and in ﬁnding transmembrane (TM) channels.
The ﬁrst program for the search of holes inside macro-
molecules is HOLE (9). HOLE ﬁnds and displays the pore
dimensions of ion channels but is limited to TM channels
and does not ﬁnd channels emanating from cavities. The
ﬁrst program designed to explore routes from protein
clefts and cavities is CAVER (10). In CAVER the protein
is mapped onto a 3D grid. Each cell is weighted such that
the lowest weighted cells are surrounded by empty space.
The search algorithm detects the lowest weighted cells and
ﬁnds the lowest cost paths from a user-speciﬁed starting
point to the surface of the protein. A recently developed
tool, called MOLE (11), replaces the large number of grid
vertices of CAVER by smaller number of vertices, which
are located on the Voronoi diagram of the centers of the
atoms. This renders the channel search more eﬃcient.
Medek et al. (8) implemented an algorithm based on the
computation of the Voronoi diagram of the atom centers.
Their algorithm is similar to the MOLE algorithm, yet it is
not accessible via a web server. To the best of our
knowledge the only available servers for channel identi-
ﬁcation in macromolecules are those of CAVER and
MOLE. The MolAxis algorithm was found to be
considerably more eﬃcient than the CAVER algorithm
with running times diﬀerences of several orders of
magnitude. On the other hand, MOLE and MolAxis

manifest similar running times; however, they diﬀer in
their performance: MOLE outputs a partially redundant
list of channels that emanate from a chamber. It attempts
to solve the redundancy problem by clustering of
channels. In addition, for TM proteins MOLE outputs
several channels, some of which are not biologically
relevant. In contrast, MolAxis (12) permits the user to
conduct searches for channels emanating from voids and
to detect TM channels using a single server. All detected
channels are geometrically distinct with no need for
clustering analysis. Since biological systems could have
diﬀerent topologies, the server provides several intuitive
optional parameters that allow more ﬂexibility in running
MolAxis. This ability to adapt the channel search to a
speciﬁc topology renders it more eﬃcient and sensitive and
yields a higher quality output. In both search types, the
MolAxis server enables the user to better control the
output by changing the parameters of the channel
search, adapting the channel detection to a given
topology. The MolAxis server was tested on a diverse
dataset of enzyme structures including several
Cytochrome P450 isoforms, haloalkane-dehalogenase,
trans-aldolase, catalase–peroxidase (Figure 1), hydrolase,
lipase and many more enzymes with buried active sites as
well as on ion channels, transporters and receptors
(Supplementary data). MolAxis can run on proteins as
well as on nucleic acid structures. MolAxis is very eﬃcient
and can handle large structural ﬁles such as the large
ribosomal subunit (Supplementary data). It has a simple
interface and uses the Jmol visualization tool (www.jmol.
org). All tests were carried out on a Pentium IV 3.0GHz
machine with 1GB of RAM running a LINUX native
operating system and the running times span between
5 and 30 seconds in most cases depending on the initial
structure dimensions and topology.
Here, we describe the web server for channel identiﬁca-
tion in macromolecules. Details related to the algorithm
theory and its application to macromolecular structures
are provided in the server ‘About MolAxis’ page and
elsewhere (12).
MolAxis: A CHANNEL FINDING ALGORITHM
BASED ON COMPUTATIONAL-GEOMETRY
TECHNIQUES
Computational-geometry techniques were developed to
represent and analyze molecular structures. The a-shapes
theory (13) was used to describe the topological and
geometrical features of molecules, including measuring the
surface area and volume of pockets (14). However, it is
rather diﬃcult to directly use the a-complex of a molecule
to describe features of channels such as its spine or
diameter. MolAxis is based on the a -shapes theory and on
a geometric concept called the medial axis (MA). The MA
of a general surface is the collection of 3D points that have
more than one closest point on the surface. Here, the
surface is the van der Waals surface of a molecule. We
represent molecular channels using corridors. A corridor is
Figure 1. The MolAxis chamber mode output page results. The results page contains a header table, channels table (left) and a Jmol viewer (right).
The channel table presents the data relating to all detected channels emanating from the active site of a bacterial catalase–peroxidase. Each row in
the table contains information about a channel including the bottleneck radius, bottleneck residues along with their chain ID and split radii of each
channel relative to the starting point. The enzyme is colored gray and represented by ribbons. The active site heme is colored orange and represented
as space-ﬁlls. Each channel is colored with respect to the channel table colors.

a probable route taken by a small molecule passing
through a channel. MolAxis uses a novel algorithm that
allows fast identiﬁcation of corridors in the complement of
the molecule. It approximates a useful subset of the MA of
the complement of the molecule. We convert a 3D
problem to a 2D problem, which improves dramatically
the performance of the algorithm. MolAxis can auto-
matically compute a source point in the center of the main
void with a high success rate or allow a user-speciﬁed
source point. A complete description of the theory and
algorithm behind the MolAxis server can be found in the
pdf ﬁles at the bottom of the ‘About MolAxis’ and the
‘web server’ page. In brief, the MolAxis algorithm
operates in four steps: (i) representation of the input
molecule using a collection of ﬁxed-sized balls; (ii) based
on the Voronoi diagram of the centers of the ﬁxed-sized
balls, we construct an approximation of the MA of the
complement of the molecule; (iii) computation of a
minimal weight tree from a user-speciﬁed point or from
an automatically computed starting point, using the
Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm (15). We avoid report-
ing duplicate channels by using a split distance parameter
that bounds the distance to the least common ancestor of
the channel thereby not reporting previously detected
channels and (iv) scoring the constructed corridors
according to the total weight of the edges in the graph.
The output includes a ranked list of the protein channels
according to the ‘ﬂux score’, that weighs in the length and
width of the channel and favors channels that are
relatively short and wide. In TM channels, the source
point is deﬁned to be at inﬁnity. In that case, the reported
channel is a concatenation of two paths in the corridor
tree, which pass through a user-deﬁned sphere and reach
the bounding sphere of the entire molecule from two
opposite directions.
MolAxis: INPUT, OUTPUT AND USER INTERFACE
MolAxis is a free web server with a user-friendly interface,
which contains seven pages: (i) about page that describes
the algorithm behind MolAxis with a complete theoretical
background at the bottom of the page; (ii) web server page
that is the main page for submitting queries. When
submission is complete the user is redirected to a results
page. This page is automatically refreshed every 5 seconds
until the calculation completes; (iii) download page that
contains a downloadable, stand-alone version for Linux
operating system; (iv) help page that describes the
parameters that can be modiﬁed by the user in the web
server as well as in the stand-alone version and the output
created by MolAxis; (v) FAQ page that presents questions
and answers; (vi) links page that contains links to related
web sites and (vii) tutorial page that describes how to run
the MolAxis stand-alone version on several examples.
INPUT
MolAxis distinguishes between (i) channels that emanate
from an inner chamber and (ii) TM channels. Therefore,
there are two separate forms for the two channel types:
chamber and transmembrane. Both forms require a single
input structure in a Protein Data Bank (PDB) format (16).
The PDB ﬁle can be uploaded to the server by using the
browse button or can be automatically retrieved by the
server from the PDB by entering a PDB code and chain
ID. An optional e-mail address ﬁeld exists and if ﬁlled, the
link to the results page is sent to the speciﬁed address.
Otherwise the link appears at the bottom of the results
page.
Channels out of chambers input form
In this channel type, the PDB ﬁle is the only required
input. An optional Source type parameter that sets the
starting point (Auto void mode–default) can be changed
to a user-deﬁned starting point. In this case, Cartesian
coordinates need to be added in the User source sphere
ﬁeld for the starting point, following a positive value for
the radius of the source sphere (default 1 A˚).
Advanced optional parameters
There are ten advanced optional ﬁelds in the channel
search main form: (i) Resolution: the resolution of the
channel search (default 0.5 A˚); (ii) Split distance: above
that distance pathways splitting are ignored (default 4 A˚);
(iii) Bounding sphere radius: maximal channel length
(default 30 A˚). This parameter is the distance from the
starting point to the last point along the search; (iv) End
channel at radius: limits the display of channel spheres to a
radius under this value (default 4 A˚); (v) Include hetatoms
is a list of all hetero atoms that are to be included in the
search. By default all hetero atoms are ignored;
(vi) Include hydrogens: use this ﬁeld to take into account
hydrogen atoms (default NO). This parameter is useful for
analyzing molecular dynamics simulations snapshots;
(vii) Mesh quality controls the visualization quality of
the Jmol viewer (default Normal); (viii) Via sphere:
Cartesian coordinates of the center of a sphere and its
radius: when addressed, MolAxis reports channels that
pass through this sphere. This reduces the search to a
speciﬁed channel in multi channel systems; (ix) Radii table:
MolAxis uses a default radii table. To use another set of
atom radii upload a ﬁle with the browse button, in the
format of the given template ﬁles and (x) Probe radius:
the user can change the radius of the probe sphere of the
channel search (default 1.4 A˚).
TM channels input form
When the user chooses to search a TM channel he is
redirected to a form similar to that of the chamber search.
The advanced parameters are the same as in chamber
channels with the exception of Split distance that is
omitted and Via sphere that is an obligatory parameter.
In addition, the user needs to ﬁll in the Channel vector
parameter which is a vector representing the general
direction of the channel or the main axis of the channel.
Given the input macromolecular topological feature
diversity in both channel types (out of chambers and
TM channels), we suggest inspection of the results and
manually changing the parameters if needed.

OUTPUT
Channels out of chambers output form
In chamber channel type with multiple channels (default),
the results page contains a header table (top),
channels table (left) and a Jmol viewer applet window
on the right (Figure 1). The header table presents all the
parameter values assigned for the run and the last column
(right) contains a link for downloading the results ﬁles
in Linux or Windows format. The channel table presents
the data for all detected channels. Each row in
the table contains information of a channel including its
bottleneck radius, bottleneck residues along with their
chain ID and split radius of the channel relative to the
starting point. By clicking on the channel checkbox in the
channels table, the user can observe the channel surface in
the Jmol viewer window. Upon clicking on the channel
gating residues list identiﬁed by MolAxis, they will be
shown as spheres in Jmol. The gating residues are located
in the channel table and denoted as bottleneck amino
acids. The user can hide the bottleneck amino acids by
pressing the ‘Hide residues’ button. The user can also view
the pathway tree of all the detected channels by clicking
the checkbox ‘Toggle all spines’.
There are ﬁve diﬀerent ﬁle types (all are text ﬁles) that
can be downloaded: (i) data.txt is a ﬁle with all the
parameter values; (ii) [PDB_code].stats_jmol.txt is a ﬁle
with running time statistics of a given run;
(iii) [PDB_code].graph_pathway_X.txt is a ﬁle that con-
tains the trajectory of the detected channel. The ﬁrst
column contains the channel radius along the channel
path at the distance shown in the second column relative
to the beginning of the channel path. The next columns
contain information about the closest atoms that
contact the channel. This information includes how
many atoms contact the channel at the distance shown
in the second column, their line numbers in the PDB
ﬁle and to which residue they belong; (iv)
[PDB_code].graph_pathway_X_all.txt is a ﬁle that con-
tains the Cartesian coordinates of the MA of the channel
along with the respective radii along the axis (fourth
column) and (v) [PDB_code].graph_pathway_X_bottle.txt
is a ﬁle that records the bottleneck radius, the distance of
the center of the corresponding sphere from the beginning
of the channel and information about the closest atoms
that contact the bottleneck sphere including their line
numbers and to which amino acid they belong.
Figure 1 presents all channels emanating from the heme
containing active site of the bacterial catalase–peroxidase
(KatG) of Burkholderia Pseudomallei (PDB code
1MWV:A). Bacterial KatGs are bi-functional enzymes
that disintegrate hydrogen peroxide by a catalase activity
[2H2O2! 2H2O+O2] or by a peroxidase activity
[H2O2+2AH! 2H2O+2A] (17). Their function is
believed to reduce reactive oxygen species as a response
to oxidative stress arising from metabolic generation or
environmental factors. The top ranked channel found by
MolAxis (colored blue in Figure 1) is the main access
channel of catalase–peroxidases (18). Residues D141 and
S324 that constitute the narrowest part of the main
channel, were shown experimentally to be the gating
residues in corresponding residues of other bacterial
catalase–peroxidase isoforms (19,20).
TM channels output form
In TM mode the result page is very similar to that of
chamber mode with the exception of the channels table.
This table has four columns. The ﬁrst column is the serial
number of a given point along the TM channel. The
second column is the distance of that point from the
beginning of the TM channel. The third column is
the radius value of the TM channel at the given distance
of the second column and the fourth column contains the
amino acids that border the sphere and can be viewed when
clicked. The downloadable ﬁles are similar to those of the
chamber mode: [PDB_code].graph_main.txt that is similar
to [PDB_code].graph_pathway_X.txt, [PDB_code].
graph_main_all.txt that is similar to [PDB_code].
graph_pathway_X_all.txt, [PDB_code].graph_main_
bottle.txt is similar to [PDB_code].graph_pathway_X_
bottle.txt and a statistics ﬁle of running times.
Figure 2 shows the main TM channel of the nicotinic
acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (PDB code 2BG9). This
receptor is located at the synapse between nerve and
muscle cells. When ACh binds the receptor, the receptor
conformation changes, opening the channel. This allows
positively charged ions to cross the membrane and initiate
muscle constriction. The receptor has three major
domains including an extra cellular domain that consists
of the ACh binding pocket, a TM domain containing TM
helices that traverse the cytoplasmatic membrane and a
cytoplasmatic domain (21). We focus on the TM domain
in Figure 2 that is believed to be located at the middle
portion of the membrane spanning pore (21). (The
channel surface is given in the Supplementary ﬁle.)
Among the lining residues of the TM channel we detected
six leucines (colored red in Figure 2) that gate the channel
and are located around the middle of the TM domain.
These leucines include L257:B, L265:B, L265:C, L273:C,
L259:E and L267:E (Figure 2). Based on mutagenesis
studies, it was suggested that these conserved leucines are
involved in the gating of the ACh receptor (22,23) and
MolAxis identiﬁes these leucines.
CONCLUSIONS
The MolAxis server was found to be sensitive, accurate
and very eﬃcient in locating channels in macromolecules
in a variety of biological systems. The server eﬃciently
detects substrate and water channels leading from deep
active sites to the protein surface, even if they are almost
closed; and it further detects the main TM channel in TM
proteins. It identiﬁes distinct channels with no redundancy
and can be applied to very large systems, including
proteins and nucleic acids. The user can manipulate the
channel search such that it will better ﬁt the speciﬁed
biological input. We hope that the server will be useful to
the biological and chemical communities, assisting in the
comprehension of gating mechanisms and substrate
selectivity of channels as well as in drug design.
