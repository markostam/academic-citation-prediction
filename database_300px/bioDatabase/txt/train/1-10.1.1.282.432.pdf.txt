ABSTRACT
ChemBank (http://chembank.broad.harvard.edu/)
is a public, web-based informatics environment
developed through a collaboration between the
Chemical Biology Program and Platform at the
Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. This knowledge
environment includes freely available data derived
from small molecules and small-molecule screens
and resources for studying these data. ChemBank is
unique among small-molecule databases in its
dedication to the storage of raw screening data,
its rigorous definition of screening experiments in
terms of statistical hypothesis testing, and its
metadata-based organization of screening experi-
ments into projects involving collections of related
assays. ChemBank stores an increasingly varied set
of measurements derived from cells and other
biological assay systems treated with small mole-
cules. Analysis tools are available and are continu-
ously being developed that allow the relationships
between small molecules, cell measurements, and
cell states to be studied. Currently, ChemBank
stores information on hundreds of thousands of
small molecules and hundreds of biomedically
relevant assays that have been performed at the
Broad Institute by collaborators from the worldwide
research community. The goal of ChemBank is to
provide life scientists unfettered access to biomed-
ically relevant data and tools heretofore available
primarily in the private sector.
INTRODUCTION
ChemBank v1.0 was initiated as a National Cancer
Institute (NCI)-sponsored activity within the Initiative
for Chemical Genetics (ICG), originally at Harvard’s
Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology. The evolving
interest of the NCI in sponsoring chemical-genetic
research has been reported (1), as has the evolution of
ICG as a public research eﬀort dedicated to accelerating
the discovery of cancer-relevant small-molecule probes (2).
At present, ChemBank v2.0 (hereafter referred to as
ChemBank) represents an evolving collaboration between
the Chemical Biology Program and Chemical Biology
Platform at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT,
including interactions with academic synthetic
chemists and biologists interested in high-throughput,
small-molecule screening approaches.
ChemBank houses chemical structures and names,
calculated molecular descriptors, human-curated biologi-
cal information regarding small molecule activities, raw
experimental results from high-throughput biological
assays, and extensive metadata describing screening
experiments. While there are many other publicly avail-
able small-molecule and drug databases [ChEBI (3),
DrugBank (4), PubChem (5) and ZINC (6), among
others], ChemBank is unique in three important ways:
(i) its dedication to the storage of raw screening data; (ii)
its rigorous deﬁnition of screening experiments in terms of
statistical hypothesis testing; and (iii) its hierarchical
metadata-based organization of related assays into screen-
ing projects. Moreover, the ChemBank website is more
than a simple data repository; it contains tools for
visualization and analysis of small-molecule results,

including raw and normalized high-throughput screening
(HTS) data and chemical-genetic proﬁles. Data sets may
be manipulated within ChemBank or downloaded for use
with external analysis tools. ChemBank is a powerful
knowledge repository and analysis environment for
chemists and biologists alike.
RESULTS
ChemBank infrastructure
The ChemBank database consists of 95 tables segmented
into seven logical groups representing compound informa-
tion, molecular descriptors, assay results, assay metadata,
biological ﬁndings, ontological associations and user
information (Figure 1). Data from over 2500 high-
throughput biological assays from 188 screening projects
currently reside in ChemBank, with new assays loaded
quarterly. ChemBank houses information on 1.7 million
compound samples, representing more than 1.2 million
unique small-molecule structures, with over 300 calculated
molecular descriptor values for each molecule. Over
1000 proteins, 500 cell lines and 70 species are associated
with the assays. ChemBank data are stored and searched
using an Oracle 10g (Oracle Corporation; Redwood
Shores, CA, USA) relational database extended with the
DayCart Oracle cartridge (Daylight Chemical
Information Systems; Aliso Viejo, CA, USA), which is
used for molecule substructure and similarity searches.
Data access and optional registration
Anyone with Internet access can use ChemBank, without
registering with a username and password, using the
‘Enter as a Guest’ button. However, registration is
highly encouraged of all users, as guest users are not
permitted to export data from ChemBank. Registered
users of ChemBank may download data directly
from their search results using the ‘[export . . . ]’ hyperlinks
on several ChemBank webpages. Downloadable
result ﬁles are exported in tab-delimited text format
for maximum ﬂexibility of use in other applications.
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) web-service
access is provided for much of the data in ChemBank.
Service calls exist to list all projects and assays
within ChemBank, as well as assay plates and well
measurements. There are also molecule services allowing
similarity and substructure searches of molecules within
ChemBank. The Web-service Deﬁnition Language
(WSDL) ﬁles for these services can be found on the
ChemBank website (http://chembank.broad.harvard.edu/
webServices.htm).
As a repository of primary data from HTS experiments,
ChemBank employs a data-embargo strategy to protect
newly generated data for a speciﬁed period, and accord-
ingly, ChemBank comprises two separate websites con-
taining overlapping datasets. Public ChemBank (http://
chembank.broad.harvard.edu/) contains small-molecule
assay data that are more than one year old as well as
molecular descriptors and published bioactivity annota-
tion for registered small molecules. Data-Sharing-
Agreement (DSA)-ChemBank contains all of the data
content of Public ChemBank as well as small-molecule
assay data that are less than one year old. Use of the latter
database is restricted to scientists who have deposited
compounds or performed screening experiments at the
Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and who have signed

passwords are assigned by the ChemBank team upon
receipt of the signed agreement. DSA-ChemBank users log
in using their assigned username and password at a
diﬀerent URL (http://chembank-dsa.broad.harvard.edu/).
ChemBank queries, molecular properties and assay
organization
ChemBank has multiple search interfaces available to the
user to enable both simple and complex queries. Users can
search for small molecules using properties such as
presence of a substructure (Figure 2a), calculated molec-
ular descriptors (Figure 2b) or association with a curated
biological activity (Figure 2c). Results from such searches
lead the user to a ‘Molecule Display’ view, which shows
basic information about the small molecule, including
names, structure, chemical descriptors, biological activity
and screening test instances (Figure 2, background).
Users may also search for speciﬁc screening assays
by searching by assay or project names, by individual
screeners or their home institution, by assay type or by the
species (e.g. of a cell line) under investigation in a
particular assay. Text searches within screening project
descriptions are also supported. Assay search result
webpages link to both assay and screening project
information; a project is a grouping of assays under a
single biological motivation. Details of an assay or
screening project are displayed on their respective
webpages, including user information and assay metadata
(Figure 3).
Simple queries can be combined to generate complex,
multi-criterion searches. ChemBank has an extensive
multi-criterion search interface, which allows searches to
be constructed interactively. This interface supports
modiﬁcation of prior search criteria or addition of new
criteria, and can be used even after initial search results
are returned. Additionally, data analysis on a single or
combination of screens housed within ChemBank can be
performed and visualized as detailed in the following
section. More information on conducting ChemBank
searches and webpages can be found in the Help section
(http://chembank.broad.harvard.edu/details.htm?
tag=Help).
ChemBank standard analysis model and visualizations
ChemBank houses both raw and normalized experimental
results from many HTS and small-molecule microarray
(SMM) (7) projects. These datasets are the foundation for
a data-analysis model speciﬁcally equipped to accumulate
rich proﬁles of small-molecule performance across
multiple, diverse biological assays. One of the primary
requirements of this approach is a data-analysis strategy
for small-molecule performance that aﬀords normalized
values independent of both the screening technology
platform and the speciﬁc biological question under
investigation. ChemBank users are not restricted to
this standard analysis paradigm; rather, each of the
ChemBank data-visualization tools aﬀords access to
multiple data types along the analysis process, including
raw data, background-subtracted data and replicate-
handled data.
ChemBank seeks to provide cross-sectional analysis
and multi-assay performance proﬁles (8–14). Therefore,
we supplemented ChemBank raw screening data with
normalized data using an error model with several salient
features. First, it renders the results of multiple parallel
assays formally comparable, regardless of the original
signal amplitudes or units of measurement. Second, it
introduces no assumptions about the strength of signal
required to call screening positives. This condition rules
out the use of arbitrary thresholds such as 2-fold induction
or 50% inhibition (15,16). Third, it does not rely on global
assumptions about the compound collection, particularly
the assumption that most compounds will be inert in any
given assay (17,18).
These three conditions suggested the use of only mock-
treatment wells as a basis for well-to-well, plate-to-plate
and experiment-to-experiment normalization. We rea-
soned that in any miniaturized assay of small-molecule
performance, we can always deﬁne a mock-treatment
condition that mirrors compound treatment in every way
except for the presence of the compound. For example,
in a typical HTS experiment, this condition is represented
by the treatment of otherwise identical assay-well contents
with the delivery vehicle, usually dimethylsulfoxide.
We conceptualize our scoring method in terms of a
formal hypothesis test comparing a compound-treatment
with its associated mock-treatment distribution, and thus
seek the most reliable estimates of the statistical param-
eters associated with this test. In an ideal world, one
would simply make many measurements of a compound’s
performance in a particular assay system, and many
measurements of the corresponding vehicle mock-treat-
ment condition in that assay system. In such a case, our
primary score for a compound would be similar to the Z’
statistic for evaluating HTS methods during assay
development (15,19). Since making a statistically mean-
ingful number of measurements of each compound’s
performance is not practical, we estimate the parameters
of the compound-treatment distribution from the param-
eters of the mock-treatment distribution. At present,
ChemBank uses a constant-error assumption for plate-
reader assays, and a variable error assumption for small-
molecule microarrays (see subsequent paragraph).
To account for plate-to-plate variation in signal (15,16),
the median raw value of mock-treatment signals on a
given assay plate is subtracted from each mock-treatment
value on the same plate (Figure 4a), providing a zero-
centered distribution of mock-treatment measurements
for each plate in one experiment. In ChemBank,
a screening experiment is deﬁned as a collection of distinct
probe source plates (e.g. a multi-microtiter plate library)
exposed to the same assay conditions at the same time.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue D353
Next, the population of zero-centered measurements for
all mock-treatment wells in the experiment are collected
together, and values failing Chauvenet’s criterion (20) for
this overall distribution are discarded (Figure 4b), to
protect against edge eﬀects and other systematic artifacts
known to present a technical problem for microtiter plate
experiments (21,22). The remaining mock-treatment mea-
surements are used to normalize each compound-treat-
ment well measurement independently, ﬁrst subtracting
the mean of remaining mock-treatment wells on the same
plate to obtain background-subtracted values (Figure 4c),
then dividing by the twice the standard deviation of mock-
treatment wells in the same experiment to obtain
dimensionless Z-scores (Figure 4d). (Note that using
twice the standard deviation is a consequence of a
constant-error assumption for microplate assays
described in the preceding paragraph; a more general
solution allows the error estimate for positive signals to
Figure 2. ChemBank oﬀers multiple routes to ﬁnd chemical information. Search tools allowing structure drawing (28) for substructure or similarity
searches (a), selection of calculated molecular descriptors (b) and selection of term-based bioactivity annotations (c), each provide avenues to ﬁnd
individual molecules or sets of molecules in ChemBank. The ChemBank ‘Molecule Display’ webpage (background) provides detailed information
about each molecule, including structure, names, molecular descriptors, biological annotations, sample information and screening instances.
D354 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue
depend on signal strength, e.g., the scale factor used for
small-molecule microarray experiments is very close to
[1+ Isignal/Imock], as determined empirically using control
arrays.) Thus, each compound well receives an algebrai-
cally signed Z-score corresponding to the number of
standard deviations it fell above or below the mean of a
well-deﬁned mock-treatment distribution. Finally, as most
screening experiments deposited in ChemBank were
performed in two technical replicates (A and B), these
replicates were combined to produce a Composite Z-score
(Figure 4e) by scaling the vector [ZA,ZB] by the cosine
correlation with a vector corresponding to ‘perfect
reproducibility’ (i.e. equal Z-scores in both replicates).
This overall normalization procedure is similar to that
described in earlier work at the Broad Institute (9,12,23),
and forms the basis for many of the ChemBank data
visualizations available to users of the database
(Figure 4f).
Currently, there are four available screening data
visualizations in ChemBank. A simple heatmap visualiza-
tion for assay plates corresponds to the microplate layout
in a screening experiment (Figure 5a). For statistical
analysis of results from multiple assay plates comprising
a single HTS experiment, ChemBank oﬀers both histo-
gram (Figure 5b) and scatterplot (Figure 4e) views.
Finally, multi-assay visualization is possible via the
‘Feature Visualization’ webpage (Figure 5c) which is
generated by implementation of the standard analysis
model to provide a heatmap representing ChemBank
‘Composite Z-score’ values for a series of assays and
compounds. These visualization tools can be used in
conjunction with the structure similarity, substructure
matching, and molecular descriptor ﬁltering capabilities
described previously to perform structure–activity rela-
tionship analyses (Figure 5d). Taken together, these search
and visualization tools represent an implementation of
chemical-genetic proﬁling and cheminformatic analysis
capabilities within ChemBank.
Data curation and annotation
Data curation activities for ChemBank fall into two
general categories: 1) annotation of information regarding
small molecules, and 2) annotation of information
regarding small-molecule assays. Annotations regarding
small-molecule eﬀects on biological systems are generated
from the primary literature. Hyperlinks to other databases
such as Entrez Gene (24), GO (25), MeSH (http://
www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) and PubMed
(5), are collected manually during curation activities.
Small molecules and clinically used drugs often have
multiple names; some drugs have dozens of diﬀerent
brand and generic names. ChemBank names are curated
from multiple sources including public databases,
the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Dictionary,

c33717387926), and chemical vendor websites to provide
an exhaustive list of names and synonyms for molecules.
For a subset of the bioactive small molecules in
ChemBank, activity annotations from the biological
literature have been added. Bioactivity annotations
(see also Figure 2) are divided into four categories:
(i) Biochemical Interactions, which indicate protein molec-
ular targets or GO molecular functions (25) aﬀected by the
small molecule; (ii) Therapeutic Indications, which specify
what diseases (i.e. MeSH terms) a small molecule is used
to treat or manage; (iii) Therapeutic Uses, terms from an
internally derived vocabulary that indicates what type of
clinical or biological activity a small molecule possesses;
and (iv) Biological Processes, which indicate GO biologi-
cal processes aﬀected by the small molecule. PubMed IDs
(5) corresponding to these citations have been captured,
but are not yet exposed to the user and GO terms
(Biochemical Interactions and Biological Processes)
describing the eﬀect(s) of the small molecule (e.g.
‘increases apoptosis’) are displayed but do not currently
connect directly to the GO website (http://
amigo.geneontology.org).
Annotation surrounding biological assays is collected
as ﬁeld-based metadata using internal controlled
vocabularies, and is used to describe screening projects,
experiments, and assay plates. Metadata associated with
a screening project express the biological motivation
and are displayed on the ‘View Project’ webpage;
metadata associated with the details of a particular assay
(instantiated as a screening ‘experiment’; see above)
are displayed on the ‘View Assay’ webpage (see also
Figure 3).
For many of the most frequently screened small
molecules in ChemBank, annotation of autoﬂuorescence
activity is available to reduce false positives by providing
automated ﬁltering in addition to detailed information
about the optical properties of the compounds.
Annotation includes a binary ﬁlter of autoﬂuorescence,
a plot of the range of wavelengths above a signal
threshold, a plot of the shape of the spectra and a
contour plot showing the autoﬂuorescence over a range
that includes wavelengths of common ﬁlter pairs.
Additional details about autoﬂuorescence detection and
data-analysis methods are available on the ChemBank
website (http://chembank.broad.harvard.edu/details.htm?
tag=Help#autoFluorMethodology).
DISCUSSION
ChemBank is a unique knowledge and analysis
environment for small molecules and high-throughput
small-molecule assays. It provides calculated molecular
Figure 4. ChemBank standard data-analysis model for high-throughput small-molecule screens. All raw small-molecule assay results in ChemBank are
further processed by comparing each measurement with the collection of mock-treatment well measurements performed in the same screening experiment.
Median values from mock-treatment wells on the same plate are used in an initial zero-centering step (a), after which the distribution of mock-treatment
measurements for the entire experiment is trimmed to eliminate systematic artifacts (b). Trimmed mock-treatment measurements are used to normalize
assay performance by ﬁrst subtracting the mean of trimmed mock-treatment measurements on the same plate to give ‘background-subtracted values’
(c), then dividing by twice the standard deviation of trimmed mock-treatment measurements for the entire experiment to give ‘dimensionless Z-score
values’ (d). Replicate handling is performed by cosine correlation of the replicate pair (for screens done in duplicate) of ‘dimensionless Z-score values’ for
each compound with a simple prior model of ‘perfect reproducibility’, to yield a ‘Composite Z-score value’ (e) that represents the ﬁnal primary screening
result. The ChemBank web interface provides access to raw and processed data types appropriate for each of its visualization tools (f).

descriptors, experimental assay measurements, and
literature-based annotation for small molecules, allowing
integration of both new and established information in a
single, public resource. Other public small-molecule
databases exist, and the following examples are meant to
be illustrative, not comprehensive. BindingDB (26) curates
small-molecule binding aﬃnities for protein targets from
the literature. KEGG LIGAND (27) and its associated
entry points seek to catalog and integrate chemical
structures, biochemical reactions, and biological informa-
tion into a single database. ZINC (6) is a database of three-
dimensional compound structures intended for virtual
screening applications. These products and the many
other examples available serve to illustrate that each
project has a diﬀerent focus, and each is designed
accordingly.
PubChem (5) is a public database, created by the NIH,
that is most similar in aims and data content to
ChemBank, but several important diﬀerences exist
between ChemBank and PubChem (Table 1). Both
databases house small-molecule structures and screening
data, but ChemBank data are generated and annotated
internally. PubChem is a deposition database, and relies
on submission of data and structures from outside
sources. Importantly, ChemBank houses raw screening
data, including assay plate position information, and
applies a standard data-analysis procedure to all datasets.
PubChem does not require raw data or plate position
information from submitters, and as such, interpretations
of outcomes may be limited to those interpretations
supplied by the submitting organization. ChemBank
uses controlled vocabularies to capture metadata,
Figure 5. Illustration of ChemBank visualizations and linking activities with chemical information. Screening data, including raw measurements, in
ChemBank are addressable by exact plate and well position in assay plates (a), and statistical data representing outcomes (b) can be reviewed at the
level of raw or normalized data. A multi-assay analysis capability takes advantage of the standard analysis procedure (Figure 4) to display the
performance of such similar compounds in multiple assays to which each has been exposed (c). Each of these capabilities can be combined with
structure and annotation-based search capabilities to provide cheminformatic analysis of molecules scoring as ‘hits’ in biological assays (d).
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue D357
and especially provides for hierarchical organization of
assays into projects; PubChem captures data and proto-
cols in free text, and organizes data by submission, rather
than grouping assays by common biological motivation.
The primary strengths of PubChem are its very useful
links to other Entrez databases and its capability to
leverage the powerful Entrez search engine. However,
although both databases house general small-molecule
information and bioassay data, we believe that storage of
plate locations and raw screening data, ﬁeld-based
metadata, and the standard experiment deﬁnition in
ChemBank aﬀord some distinct advantages over
PubChem. In particular, we believe that ChemBank
will be especially eﬀective in revealing unrecognized
small-molecule performance relationships because of its
support of statistically rigorous cross-sectional analyses
that harness the collective power of all experiments in
the database (i.e. analyses of data derived from many
diﬀerent types of screens and small molecules).
By committing itself to storing raw screening data,
deﬁning screening experiments in a rigorous manner,
and organizing screening experiments hierarchically using
metadata, ChemBank provides a unique opportunity to
the scientiﬁc community, even beyond computational
scientists. ChemBank provides access to large volumes
of data annotating chemical entities with measured
outcomes, and the commitment to storage of raw data
ensures that these measurements are available for data-
mining activities. In this sense, ChemBank is an important
social experiment in science, in that it permits an analysis
of whether the interpretation of screening data by the
investigators performing small-molecule screens indeed
reveal all the value in their performance. Alternatively,
cross-sectional analysis of results deposited by multiple
independent investigators may reveal outcomes not
apparent to participants in any individual screening
project. To that end, ChemBank allows customization of
options for viewing chemical-genetic proﬁles for the
resulting molecules using any associated assay data, and
as such, allows users to exploit this assembled information
to support discovery and experimentation in chemical
biology research. The open, standardized data-sharing
environment of ChemBank is geared toward rapid
discovery of novel therapeutic candidates and a deep
understanding of biological systems.
