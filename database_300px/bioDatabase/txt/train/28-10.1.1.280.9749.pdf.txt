ABSTRACT
Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1) recognizes
DNA strand interruptions in vivo and triggers its
own modification as well as that of other proteins by
the sequential addition of ADP-ribose to form
polymers. This modification causes a release of
PARP-1 from DNA ends and initiates a variety of
responses including DNA repair. While PARP-1 has
been firmly implicated in base excision and single
strand break repair, its role in the repair of DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs) remains unclear. Here,
we show that PARP-1, probably together with DNA
ligase III, operates in an alternative pathway of non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) that functions as
backup to the classical pathway of NHEJ that
utilizes DNA-PKcs, Ku, DNA ligase IV, XRCC4, XLF/
Cernunnos and Artemis. PARP-1 binds to DNA ends
in direct competition with Ku. However, in irradiated
cells the higher affinity of Ku for DSBs and an
excessive number of other forms of competing DNA
lesions limit its contribution to DSB repair. When
essential components of the classical pathway of
NHEJ are absent, PARP-1 is recruited for DSB
repair, particularly in the absence of Ku and non-
DSB lesions. This form of DSB repair is sensitive to
PARP-1 inhibitors. The results define the function of
PARP-1 in DSB repair and characterize a candidate
pathway responsible for joining errors causing
genomic instability and cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Endogenous cellular processes and exogenous factors, such
as ionizing radiation (IR) generate highly cytotoxic double
strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA that undermine genomic
integrity. Higher eukaryotes utilize a pathway of non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) to repair the majority of
DSBs that employs the products of DNA-PKcs, KU70,
KU80, LIG4, XRCC4 and Artemis (1,2), as well as the
recently characterized factor XLF/Cernunos (3,4). Proteins
of this pathway are important caretakers of the mammalian
genome and knock out of KU, LIG4, or XRCC4 invariably
leads to cancer on a p53/ background (5–7).
Tumors formed in the above mutant mice, mainly pro-B
lymphomas, carry chromosomal translocations linking an
amplified c-myc oncogene with the IgH locus sequences.
The initial non-reciprocal translocation event, as well as the
subsequent steps in the amplification process requires joining
of DNA ends. Due to the defect in the DNA-PK dependent
pathway (D-NHEJ), end joining must be carried out in
these mutants by an alternative process prone to missjoining
and possibly utilizing microhomologies (8–10). Alternative
pathways of end joining are also implicated in genomic
instability (5,11,12), in the formation of soft tissue sarcomas
(13) and in the aberrant coding and signal joints formed dur-
ing V(D)J recombination (14–17) in NHEJ mutant mice.
Furthermore, alternative forms of end joining operate in the
repair of IR-induced DSBs. Mutants with defects in NHEJ
show pronounced inhibition but still rejoin the majority of
DSBs by a slowly operating pathway (18–20). Because this
repair pathway does not show dependence on genes of HRR
(20), it is thought to reflect an alternative form of end joining
that functions as backup (B-NHEJ) to the DNA-PK dependent
pathway (D-NHEJ).
These results implicate alternative pathways of end joining
in genomic integrity through contributions to DSB repair,
particularly when D-NHEJ is compromised. However, due
to their low fidelity, the same repair pathways are directly
implicated in genomic instability and cancer. Despite the
potentially grave consequences of their functions, little is
known about the biochemistry of these pathways, as well as
the mechanisms of their regulation and integration into the

cellular DNA DSB processing machinery, beyond the obser-
vation that they frequently utilize microhomologies (8,9).
Recent work identifies DNA ligase III as a candidate factor
in alternative pathways of NHEJ (21,22) and points to
PARP-1 as an additional potential contributor (22). PARP-1
is an abundant nuclear enzyme of higher eukaryotes that
has been implicated in many cellular processes including
DNA repair. It is a member of a superfamily of eighteen pro-
teins containing PARP domains, of which only PARP-2 has
also been implicated in DNA damage response (23–25).
The 116 kDa PARP-1 has two zinc finger motifs that mediate
binding to single strand breaks (SSBs) and DSBs. This bind-
ing enables the protein to cleave NAD+ to nicotinamide and
ADP-ribose and to form branched ADP-ribose polymers on
glutamic acid residues of target proteins, including itself.
PARP-1 is involved in SSB repair, BER or NER, together
with XRCC1, DNA ligase III, as well as polynucleotide
kinase (PNK), PCNA and FEN1 (26,27) and plays an essen-
tial role in removing lesions converted to DSBs during DNA
replication (28,29). Although PARP-1 is implicated in DSB
repair (30–33) the results are variable and the mechanism
unknown (23,34,35). Here, we present experiments demon-
strating that PARP-1 contributes to DSB repair as a compo-
nent of an alternative pathway of NHEJ.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, chemicals and irradiation
The cell lines M059J and M059K (36), were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1%
non-essential amino acids and 1% L-glutamine. Ku70/
(37) cells were maintained in MEM and LIG4/ (6),
MEFs were maintained in D-MEM plus 10% FCS. COM3,
COR3 and COC1 cells are derivatives of the SV40 trans-
formed Chinese hamster cell line, CO60 (30). COM3 cells
express PARP-1 DBD under the control of the mouse mam-
mary tumor virus long terminal repeat sequence that confers
dexamethasone (Dex) inducibility. COR3 is a control cell
line generated by transfection of CO60 cells with the HGO
and pTKhygro expression constructs. COC1 is a cell line
constitutively overexpressing the PARP-1 DBD. All CO60
derivatives were maintained in DMEM containing 5% FCS.
When necessary, geneticin (800 mg/ml) and/or hygromycin
(800 U/ml) were added, but were generally removed 24 h
before inception of the experiment. xrs-6 is a CHO mutant
with a defect in KU80 and xrs-6/KU80 a cell line generated
by transfecting with the human KU80 under the control
of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter
(38). V3 is a DNA-PKcs deficient CHO cell line. Cells
were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with
5% FCS.
30-Aminobenzamide (30-AB) (Sigma) was dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4 M) and used at 10 mM. 3,4-
Dihydro-5-[4-(1-piperidinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinolinone
(DPQ) (Alexis Biochemicals) was dissolved in DMSO (16.8
mM) and used at 10 mM. 1,5-Dihydroxyisoquinoline (DIQ)
(Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO (0.5M) and used at 100
mM. Wortmannin (Wort) (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO
(25 mM) and used at 20 mM. Cells were exposed to X-rays
using a Pantak X-ray machine operated at 320 kV, 10 mA
with a 1.6 mm Al filter (effective photon energy about
90 kV), at a dose rate of 2.7 Gy/min.
Western blotting and immunofluorescence
Western blotting was used to detect PARP-1 and PARP-1
DBD expression, as well as pADPr. For this purpose nuclear,
cytoplasmic or whole cell extracts were prepared using stan-
dard procedures. After electrophoresis in 10% SDS–PAGE
and electroblotting (PVDF membrane, Millipore, Germany),
the membrane was processed according to the instructions
of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). PARP-1 and
PARP-1 DBD were visualized with a rabbit anti-PARP-1
antibody (Calbiochem). pADPr was detected with rabbit
anti-pADPr antibody (Calbiochem). Intracellular NAD+
levels were determined in irradiated and non-irradiated cells
using an enzymatic cycling assay (39,40). For indirect
immunofluorescence, cells grown on poly-L-lysine treated
coverslips were permeabilized with 10 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), 300 mM Sucrose, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2,
freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer) and
0.5% Triton X-100 and were subsequently incubated with
10% TCA (20 min, RT) and then with 0.5% Nonidet P40
(5 min). Slides were blocked for 1 h at room temperature
with 10% FCS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incu-
bated with 1:100 diluted rabbit anti-(ADP-ribose)-polymer
IgG (Calbiochem) followed by Alexa Fluor 488 or fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500,
Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence was evaluated with
a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS4, Leica,
Germany). A mouse monoclonal antibody against Ku70,
clone N3H10 and Ku80, clone 111, were from Kamiya
Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA); a mouse monoclonal antibody
against GAPDH, from Chemico International. Semi-purified
PARP-1 (specific activity: 261 nmol ADP-ribose/min/mg
total protein at 25C) was from Biomol (Hamburg). Ku was
purified from baculovirus infected Sf9 cells as described
previously (41).
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
Asymmetric Field Inversion Gel Electrophoresis (AFIGE)
was used for the quantification of DNA DSBs after exposure
to IR, as described previously (19,42). Cells were embedded
in agarose (InCert agarose, BioRad) and processed for lysis.
In divergence to the original protocol and in order to reduce
conversion of heat labile sites to DSBs (43), high temperature
was avoided during lysis. Agarose blocks were lysed in a buf-
fer (pH 8.0) containing 400 mM EDTA, 2% NLS, 0.3 mg/ml
proteinase K at 4C for 16 h; they were subsequently washed
with TE buffer and incubated for 24 h at 4C in a solution
containing 1.85 M NaCl, 0.15 M KCl, 4 mM Tris, 0.5% Tri-
ton X-100 (pH 7.5). PFGE was carried out, after RNAase
treatment, in 0.5% agarose gels cast in the presence of ethid-
ium bromide, in 0.5· TBE at 8C for 40 h using alternating
cycles of 50 V (1.25 V/cm) for 900 s in the forward direction
and 200 V (5.0 V/cm) for 75 s in the reverse direction. Gels
were scanned in the Typhoon and analyzed using the Image-
Quant software (GE Biosciences). The fraction of DNA
released (FDR) from the well into the lane is a measure of
DSBs present. FDR measured in non-irradiated samples
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 21 6171
(background; usually between 2–8%) was subtracted from
FDR measured in samples exposed to IR.
In vivo plasmid end joining
To document a role for PARP-1 in DNA end joining in vivo
we employed a fast-readout plasmid rejoining assay utilizing
the plasmid pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 (44). The plasmid was
digested with HindIII, or I-SceI, to remove Ad2 and generate
different types of ends. Supercoiled pEGFP-Pem1 was used
as a positive control to standardize the transfection and
analysis conditions. The pDsRed2-N1 plasmid (Clontech)
was co-transfected with either linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2
or supercoiled pEGFP-Pem1 as a control of transfection effi-
ciency. Plasmids were transfected using the MEF1 nucleofec-
tor kit in the Nucleofector devise (Amaxa) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. Green (EGFP) and Red
(DsRed) fluorescence were measured by flow cytometry
24 h later (21). The EGFP signal in this assay increases
initially, approximately linearly, with increasing amount of
plasmid, but reaches at higher concentrations a plateau in a
cell-line-dependent manner (44). To avoid measurements
near the plateau region that compromise quantification, calib-
ration curves were generated for each cell lines using circular
pEGFP-Pem1 plasmid (M. Wang and G. Iliakis, unpublished
data). The results were used to select cell-line-dependent
amounts of linear pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 plasmid allowing evalu-
ation of the effects of PARP-1 inhibitors in each cell line.
However, since different cell lines have different calibration
curves and because the results obtained have not been nor-
malized against a common standard, the signal levels
shown cannot be taken as a direct measure of the DNA end
joining capacity of each cell line—i.e. they do not directly
reflect the absolute end joining levels of each cell line.
For cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized and fixed in
70% ethanol. They were stained in PBS containing 62 mg/ml
RNase A and 40 mg/ml propidium iodide at 37C for 15 min.
RNA interference
RNA interference, mediated by siRNAs was used to knock-
down Ku expression in LIG4/ MEFs. For this purpose
the sequences S1: GGAUCAUGCUGUUCACCAA (487 nt
downstream), as well as the unique negative control duplex
(OR-0030-neg05) were synthesized (Eurogentec, Belgium)
and tested by transfection with electroporation under the con-
ditions described above using 5 · 106 cells and 10 mg KU or
control siRNA per transfection reaction. After transfection,
cells were returned to normal growth conditions and the
level of knock-down evaluated by western blotting. To test
the effect of Ku knock-down on DNA DSB repair, siRNA
treated cells were transfected with test and control plasmids
and rejoining efficiency measured 24 h later.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Competition between Ku and PARP-1 for DNA end binding
was assessed by EMSA (45,46). Oligonucleotides used were
OA (G-GCC-GCA-CGC-GTC-CAC-CAT-GGG-GTA-CAA),
OB (G-TAG-TTG-TAC-CCC-ATG-GTG-GAC-GCG-TGC),
OB1 (T-TGT-ACC-CCA-TGG-TGG-ACG-CGT-GCG-GCC)
and OB3 (T-GTA-CCC-CAT-GGT-GGA-CGC-GTG-CGG-
CCT). Annealing of OA with OB, OB1 or OB3 resulted in
double-stranded DNA molecules with 4 nt overhang, blunt
ends and one nucleotide overhang at 30 ends, respectively.
They were 30 end labeled with 32P using [g-32P]ATP and
polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas). End binding was assessed
by incubating 1 ng (unless stated otherwise) of 32P labeled
DNA with protein in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and
150 mM NaCl at 25C for 20 min. Supershift of the Ku band
was achieved with an anti-Ku80 antibody (Kamiya, Clone
111) added to the reaction before the substrate DNA. Reactions
were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5· TBE
buffer. The gels were dried and analyzed in the Typhoon
(GE Biosciences).
RESULTS
PARP-1 inhibition compromises rejoining
of DNA DSBs in the absence of Ku
Although PARP-1 has been repeatedly implicated in the
repair of DNA DSBs, a consistent model explaining existing
data and placing this enzyme in a network with other known
DSB repair pathways is not available. The genetic and bio-
chemical implication of DNA Ligase III, with which
PARP-1 frequently cooperates, in backup pathways of end
joining (see Introduction) offer alternative ways of interpreta-
tion for existing data and a rationale for the formulation of
alternative hypotheses. We reasoned that if PARP-1 is
involved in backup pathways of NHEJ, a way for document-
ing this contribution would be by applying PARP-1 inhibitors
to D-NHEJ deficient mutants or by combining PARP-1 with
DNA–PK inhibitors.
In the repair proficient human glioma M059K cells,
30-aminobenzamide (30-AB) has no detectable effect on
DSB repair (Supplementary Figure 1B and C), although
immunofluorescence of poly(ADP-ribose) shows that
PARP-1 activity is significantly reduced (Supplementary
Figure 1A). We reasoned that if PARP-1 is involved in alter-
native pathways of NHEJ, exposure of D-NHEJ deficient
mutants to PARP-1 inhibitors should uncover this contribu-
tion. Therefore, the same experiment was carried out in
M059J cells that lack DNA–PK activity due to a frameshift
mutation in DNA–PKcs (36,47). M059J cells show reduced
efficiency for DSB rejoining after IR (19,36), as compared
to M059K cells, but repair nevertheless the majority of
DSBs with slow kinetics via DNA–PK independent mecha-
nisms (19). Despite the defect in D-NHEJ, treatment
with 30-AB fails to inhibit DSB rejoining (Supplementary
Figure 1B and C); similar results are obtained with DPQ,
another widely used PARP-1 inhibitor (data not shown).
Ligation is the final step in DNA end joining and D-NHEJ
recruits DNA ligase IV in this function. Compared to wild-
type cells, LIG4/ cells have significantly reduced rejoining
efficiency but remove over 70% of DSBs with slower kinetics
through a DNA ligase IV-independent pathway (Figure 1A).
Treatment with 30-AB has no effect on wild-type cells, but
exerts a small effect on LIG4/ cells.
A prerequisite for PARP-1 activation and therefore
involvement in DSB repair is binding to DNA ends. In the
above mutants and despite the defects in DNA–PKcs and
DNA ligase IV, Ku is present at normal intracellular levels
6172 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 21
(46). We reasoned that in the absence of key D-NHEJ compo-
nents, Ku will bind DNA ends non-productively and will exert
a dominant negative effect that will limit the engagement of
PARP-1. To examine this possibility, we tested a radiation
sensitive Chinese hamster mutant, xrs-6, defective in Ku80
as a result of a nonsense mutation, and a corrected clone,
xrs-6/Ku80, derived by ectopic expression of human Ku80
(38) (Figure 2A and B). Ku80 deficiency compromises DSB
rejoining in xrs-6 cells as compared to xrs-6/Ku80, but here
again alternative pathways remove over 80% of DSBs within
24 h (Figure 2B). While DPQ has no detectable effect on DSB
rejoining in corrected cells, it produces a clear inhibition in xrs-
6 cells. The greater inhibition of DSB repair is not caused by a
greater inhibition of PARP-1 in Ku80 deficient cells, as simi-
lar inhibition is observed for both types of cells (Figure 2A).
Despite slight differences in response, DPQ is also effective
in inhibiting DSB rejoining in fibroblasts derived from
Ku70/ mice (37) (Figure 2C). This result suggests that
the observed phenotype is not a peculiarity of Ku80 deficient
Chinese hamster cells, but can also be observed in Ku70/
MEFs. Thus, in agreement with competition against Ku, the
contribution of PARP-1 to alternative pathways of NHEJ is
clearly detectable in Ku deficient, very small in LIG4/
and undetectable in DNA–PKcs deficient cells.
Overexpression of PARP-1 DBD inhibits
rejoining of DNA DSBs
Overexpression of the PARP-1 DNA-binding domain (DBD)
causes a trans-dominant inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation

X-rays and returned to 37C for repair. At various times thereafter cells were collected and prepared for AFIGE to measure residual DNA DSBs. The upper panel
shows gels from a typical experiment and the lower panel the results of their quantitative analysis. Plotted is FDR, a measure of DNA DSBs present, as a function
of the repair time. Shown are the means and standard errors calculated from four determinations in two experiments. The value of FDR measured in non-
irradiated cells has been subtracted from the results shown. Standard lysis conditions were used in these experiments but similar results have been obtained with
low temperature lysis. (B) COM3 cells expressing the PARP-1 DBD under the control of the mouse mammary virus LTR that is dexamethasone inducible were
incubated with 50 nM dexamethasone for 24 h or left untreated. Thereafter, cells were exposed to 40 Gy and allowed to repair at 37C in the presence (20 mM) or
absence of wortmannin (given 1 h before IR). Repair of DSBs was measured by AFIGE and is expressed as FDR versus repair time. The upper panel shows
typical gels and the lower panel the repair kinetics plotted as FDR versus time. Shown are the means and standard errors calculated from six determinations in
three experiments.

interrupting several functions of PARP-1 (30,48). Because the
PARP-1 DBD can in principle also bind to DNA ends and
compete with Ku, we wished to evaluate the effect of its
expression on the rejoining of IR-induced DNA DSBs. We
introduced this approach, first because high levels of PARP-
1 DBD are expected to generate efficient competition against
Ku for DNA ends and second because it offers a useful alter-
native to chemical inhibitors (30). We measured rejoining of
DSBs in a cell line, COM3, conditionally expressing PARP-
1 DBD under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible pro-
moter (Supplementary Figure 2A). No changes in PARP-1
levels and no PARP-1 DBD expression are observed after
treatment with dexamethasone in COR3 cells that only express
the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR). COM3 cells show
detectable induction at 5 nM dexamethasone and steady
further increase up to 500 nM, where expression reaches levels
comparable to those of COC1 cells. Expression of PARP-1
DBD using 50 nM dexamethasone inhibits IR-induced
PARP-1 activation, as measured by poly(ADP-ribose) anal-
ysis by western blotting (Supplementary Figure 2B), immuno-
fluorescence (Supplementary Figure 2C) or the intracellular
NAD+ pools (Supplementary Figure 2D). Similar results

were obtained at higher concentrations of dexamethasone.
Overexpression of PARP-1 DBD has been previously shown
to inhibit DNA DSB rejoining in these cells (32). The results
in Figure 1B demonstrate that under our conditions PARP-1
DBD expression causes a modest inhibition in DNA DSB
rejoining, which is enhanced after inhibition of DNA–PK
with wortmannin (Figure 1B). Wortmannin alone causes a
strong delay in DSB rejoining (Figure 1B), although here
again the majority of DSBs are removed by DNA–PK inde-
pendent processes. The stronger effect of PARP-1 DBD
expression on DSB rejoining, as compared to chemical
inhibitors, on D-NHEJ deficient background suggests effects
beyond PARP-1 inhibition and points to DNA-binding in
competition with Ku.
PARP-1 contributes to the rejoining of plasmid DSBs
in Ku or DNA ligase IV deficient cells
To further test the postulated competition between PARP-1
and Ku, we introduced an in vivo plasmid end joining
assay. The assay allows, in addition to the generation of
defined DSBs, also follow up of their repair in cells without
other forms of DNA damage; IR exposed cells carry a 20-fold
excess of SSBs and base damages compared to DSBs that
compete for PARP-1. In this rapid-readout, direct-reporting
plasmid assay, end joining is measured by the restitution of
EGFP expression (21,44).
Principal characteristic of the plasmid (pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2)
used in the assay (Figure 3A) is the interruption of the EGFP
sequence by the Pem1 intron, within which restriction sites
for HindIII and I-SceI are engineered upstream and down-
stream of the Ad2 exon (Figure 3A). Digestion with HindIII
at both sites generates a linear plasmid with cohesive
50-overhangs, whereas digestion with I-SceI at both sites
and because of their inverted orientation, incompatible
30-overhangs (Figure 3A). Because of the retention of the
Ad2 exon, partial digestion at only one restriction site gener-
ates upon ligation a product unable to express EGFP. Due to
the ‘buffering’ capacity of the intron, end joining of trans-
fected, linearized plasmid by the cellular repair apparatus
reconstitutes EGFP expression, even when extensive addi-
tions or deletions of nucleotides have occurred (44). As a
result, a wide spectrum of end joining events can be detected.
When HindIII linearized plasmid is introduced into Ku
proficient cells, intracellular circularization allowing EGFP
expression is detected and quantitated by flow cytometry
(Figure 3B). It is evident that plasmid rejoining in these
cells is not affected by PARP-1 inhibitors (Figure 3B
and C). In Ku80 deficient xrs-6 cells, on the other hand, the
overall repair efficiency is lower. This may be a reflection of
the reduced efficiency of B-NHEJ, the intracellular instability
of the plasmid and the overall design of this experiment that
preclude conclusions on ultimate end joining levels as is the
case in experiments with genomic DNA (see Figures 1 and
2). However, residual end joining of HindIII linearized plas-
mid is reduced over 60% by 30-AB or DIQ in Ku deficient
cells, thus implicating PARP-1 in DSB rejoining under
these conditions. A similar reduction in end joining is also
observed in I-SceI linearized plasmid suggesting that the
pathway rejoins both compatible as well as incompatible
DNA ends (Figure 3B and C). A Chinese hamster mutant
with defect in DNA–PKcs shows no reduction in DNA end
joining after treatment either with 30-AB or DIQ, suggesting
a specific inhibitory effect for Ku on PARP-1 mediated end
joining.
We carried out similar experiments using LIG4/ and
wild-type MEFs (6) to examine whether the small effect of
PARP-1 inhibition observed in irradiated cells (Figure 1A)
can be amplified in the plasmid assay that employs non-
irradiated cells. Treatment of wild-type MEFs with 30-AB
or DIQ produces no effect on DNA end joining in HindIII
digested plasmid (Figure 4A and B). In LIG4/ MEFs, plas-
mid end joining is also observed, but in contrast to wild-type
cells, treatment with 30-AB or DIQ reduces end joining by
over 60% (Figure 4A and B). A similar effect is observed
with plasmid digested with I-SceI to generate incompatible
ends. Thus, the plasmid assay detects a clear contribution
of PARP-1 to DSB end joining when D-NHEJ is compro-
mised by a defect in LIG4.
To examine whether Ku interferes with DNA end joining
even under conditions where D-NHEJ is compromised by
defects in proteins other than Ku, we knocked down Ku in
LIG4/ cells. With the selected (from three tested) siRNA
sequence, western blotting shows a 70% knock-down effect
(Figure 4D). Ku knock-down is accompanied by a nearly
doubling in the efficiency of end joining in LIG4/ MEFs
(Figure 4C and D). Excess rejoining observed after Ku knock-
down involves PARP-1, as it remains sensitive to 30-AB
(Figure 4E). Although here the relative effect of 30-AB is
similar to that of untreated controls, in absolute terms, a
greater number of ends is prevented from joining after Ku
knock-down due to the larger overall efficiency of the reac-
tion (see Figure 4D). These results confirm a dominant nega-
tive effect of Ku in cells with defective D-NHEJ, and suggest
that Ku binding limits the recruitment of alternative pathways
utilizing PARP-1.
The observed difference in the magnitude of inhibition by
30-AB or DIQ of IR-induced genomic DNA DSBs and of
plasmid end joining in LIG4/ cells can be attributed to
competition for PARP-1 between DSBs and other DNA
lesions present in great excess in irradiated cells. To examine
this possibility, we treated LIG4/ MEFs with H2O2 (5 mM,
5 min, RT) just before plasmid transfection to measure end
joining and the effect of PARP-1 inhibitors (Figure 5).
Untreated MEFs show the expected DNA end joining that
is reduced by over 50% after treatment with either 30-AB
or DIQ (Figure 5A and B). Notably, inhibition of PARP-1
by the same inhibitors is less effective after treatment of
cells with H2O2 suggesting a reduction in PARP-1 contribu-
tion, probably as a result of its engagement in the repair of
H2O2 induced DNA SSB and base damages in genomic
DNA. Reduced effect of PARP-1 inhibitors is seen despite
an overall increase in DNA end joining capacity in H2O2 trea-
ted cells (Figure 5C). This increase probably reflects the
redistribution of H2O2 treated cells throughout the cell
cycle, and their accumulation in G2 (Figure 5C). Thus, the
contribution of PARP-1 to DSB repair is compromised in
the presence of H2O2 induced SSBs and base damages sug-
gesting that in irradiated cells, the same lesions will divert
PARP-1 from DSBs. In the absence of DNA ligase IV,
DNA ligase III is expected to carry out the end joining
required to generate the signal detected here. This suggests

available, it is not an absolute requirement for the reaction
to take place.
Competition between PARP-1 and Ku for
DNA end binding
We employed an EMSA to examine the DNA end binding
properties of Ku and PARP-1 and to test competition between
the two proteins for DNA ends. PARP-1 effectively binds a
radioactively labeled double-stranded DNA substrate causing
a mobility shift that is clearly detectable above 1 pmol protein
(Supplementary Figure 3A). Because PARP-1 activity varies
significantly depending on the type of DNA ends (49), we
examined three substrates carrying 4 nt 30 overhangs, blunt
ends, or 1 nt 30 overhangs. Since similar efficiency for
DNA end binding is observed with all substrates, further
experiments are carried out using 4 nt 30 overhangs (OA/OB).
OA/OB binds also avidly to Ku (Supplementary Figure
3A), generating a measurable shift at 0.2 pmol and complete
shift at 0.5 pmol protein. Thus, as expected (50) Ku binds
DNA ends with an approximately 10-fold higher affinity
than PARP-1. Because the band generated by Ku has an
electrophoretic mobility very similar to that of PARP-1, a

comparison of the DNA end binding characteristics in the
presence of both proteins is not directly possible. We
exploited antibody mediated supershift to separate Ku and
PARP-1 bands. An anti-Ku80 antibody causes a robust super-
shift that clears the region of the original main Ku band
allowing thus parallel analysis of PARP-1 DNA-binding
(Supplementary Figure 3B). From the bands generated by
supershift, the lower one (Ku-S1) is thought to reflect loading
of each DNA end with a single Ku molecule, whereas the
upper one (Ku-S2) loading with two Ku molecules (45). As
expected, the mobility characteristics of PARP-1 are not
affected by the anti-Ku antibody.
To examine competition between Ku and PARP-1, we first
incubated substrate with Ku/antibody mixture and added sub-
sequently PARP-1 at the indicated amounts (Figure 6). Ku at
0.2 pmol causes supershift for the majority of the substrate,
mainly generating the band expected for single molecule
loading (Figure 6A). Increasing amount of PARP-1 generates

the expected band initially utilizing unbound substrate. At
higher concentrations, however, the PARP-1 band is strength-
ened with parallel weakening of the Ku-S1 band (Figure 6A).
Thus, PARP-1 displaces Ku from DNA ends, but a significant
effect is observed at PARP-1/Ku molar ratios above ten.
When the same assay is carried out with 0.5 pmol Ku
(Figure 6B), two prominent bands are generated by supershift
(Ku-S1 and Ku-S2), but PARP-1 effectively competes for
DNA ends mainly populated by a single Ku molecule
(Ku-S1). The greater stability of Ku-S2 band suggests that
after loading of multiple Ku molecules, cooperative binding
stabilizes the structure. When the same experiment is carried
out in inverse sequence of protein addition, Ku effectively
displaces PARP-1 from DNA ends, with more than two thirds
removed after addition of 0.5 pmol protein (Figure 6C).
These results are in line with previous observations in differ-
ent model systems (51) and provide biochemical evidence for
competition for DNA ends between PARP-1 and Ku,
although successful displacement by PARP-1 requires con-
centrations higher by an order of magnitude than those of
Ku. Such conditions may be approached after overexpression
of PARP-1 DBD (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
Taken together the results presented identify PARP-1 as a
component of an alternative pathway of NHEJ and provide
evidence that DNA end binding, in direct competition with
Ku, is a key determinant of pathway selection. Additional
data provide biochemical evidence for an engagement of
DNA ligase III, a known partner of PARP-1, in DSB repair
(21,22). In a directly relevant biochemical study using a
novel two-step in vitro DNA end joining assay, immune to
interference by Ku, Audebert et al. (22) reported that DNA
end joining requires the synapsis activity of PARP-1 and
the ligation activity of the XRCC1-DNA ligase III complex.
Thus, the repair module PARP-1/DNA ligase III/XRCC1
(PLX), hitherto regarded as central in SSB repair (52,53), is
implicated in the repair of DSBs. This function may not rely
on novel activities, as DSBs form when SSBs occur in close
proximity, in opposite DNA strands. The much higher affinity
of Ku for DNA ends will limit the contribution of this form of
end joining to instances where the classical pathway is com-
promised. As a result, its function will be more that of a
backup (B-NHEJ) and less of an ‘alternative’ repair pathway
(54).
Several reports implicate inferior backup pathways of
DNA end joining in the phenotypes of mutants of the classi-
cal NHEJ pathway. Thus, non-classical pathways of end join-
ing bring together the c-myc and Igh locus and cause B-cell
lymphomas in mice with defects in Ku, LIG4 or XRCC4
(5–8,11,12,55). Functionally equivalent pathways may gener-
ate the aberrant junctions manifesting chromosome instability
in the same mutants. Non-classical pathways of end joining
generate the few V(D)J junctions observed in cells with
Figure 6. EMSA shows that Ku and PARP-1 compete for DNA ends. (A) EMSA was carried out by incubating the indicated amounts of Ku and anti-Ku80
antibody in the presence of 2 ng radioactively labeled OA/OB substrate for 15 min. Subsequently PARP-1 was added at the indicated amounts for 30 min, the
reaction was stopped and products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Two bands generated by antibody mediated supershift of Ku are termed Ku-S1 and
Ku-S2 and reflect loading of the substrate ends with one or two Ku molecules, respectively. The band generated by PARP-1 is also shown. (B) Same as A, but for
reactions assembled with 0.5 pmol Ku and 0.7 pmol anti-Ku antibody. Note that Ku-S2 band gains intensity and that loaded Ku can be only partly displaced under
these conditions. (C) Same as in A, but with reactions incubated first with 400 ng PARP-1 followed by incubation with the indicated amounts of KU and anti-KU
antibody.

defects in NHEJ (14,15,17) and are implicated in antibody
class switching occurring under the same conditions (55).
Although not formally demonstrated, PARP-1 may be partici-
pating in these forms of non-classical end joining [e.g. (56)].
Furthermore, the substantial DNA end joining observed after
exposure to IR of cells with defects in DNA ligase IV, Ku and
DNA–PK (Figures 1 and 2, and Supplementary Figure 1)
directly implicates alternative forms of DNA end joining.
The results presented here and published data (21,22) impli-
cate PARP-1 and DNA Ligase III in this function.
PARP-1/DNA Ligase III dependent end joining, when uti-
lized, helps the cell to restore its genome and thus presumably
to avert cell death. However, its error prone nature causes
genomic instability and cancer in the affected organism.
The adverse consequences of this repair pathway may derive
from inefficient synapsis of the DNA ends, which is probably
supported only by microhomologies (9,10) and is therefore
inefficient and slow [Figures 1 and 2, and Supplementary Fig-
ure 1; and (19,54,57)]. The resulting persistence of DNA ends
in the cell can lead to incorrect rejoining and thus to translo-
cations. In addition, it may facilitate DNA end degradation
and thus loss of genetic information. Both phenomena have
been described in mutants of the classical pathway of DNA
end joining (see above).
While prominent when the classical pathway is compro-
mised, the backup pathway may theoretically be utilized to
a limited degree in cells with functional D-NHEJ as well.
This can occur when a DSB is induced in a nuclear region
where Ku or other key components of D-NHEJ, are not
immediately available; for example because they are already
recruited to a neighboring DSB. Such contributions may
underlie micronuclei observed in PARP-1/ cells (58), as
well as genomic instability and occasionally tumor develop-
ment in PARP-1/ mice on p53/ background (59,60).
Our results further show that the function of PARP-1 in
DSB repair will be competed by its canonical function in
SSB repair. Reduced engagement in the repair of a highly
dangerous lesion as the DSB through competition by a less
severe one, a SSB, is a limitation of the pathway and justifies
its ranking as a backup. It follows that DSBs induced by
agents generating higher ratios of DSBs to SSBs than IR,
e.g. calicheamicin g?, are more likely to engage PARP-1
(22). However, this distinction of severity between SSBs
and DSBs may be altered during S phase, where SSBs can
be converted to one-ended DSBs which, if not repaired by
HRR, can have serious consequences for the cell (28,29).
Inhibition of a PARP-1 dependent backup pathway of DSB
end joining partly explains the lethality of PARP-1//Ku/
mice (61), as normal development may not be compatible
with inactivation of both NHEJ pathways. Along similar
lines it can be reasoned that the lethality of PARP-1//
ATM/ mice partly derives from a contribution of ATM to
a subset of radiation-induced complex DSBs that require
D-NHEJ (62). Also, tumor formation in PARP-1/ mice
engineered with Ku haploinsufficiency (63), or DNA–PK
knock out (64), suggests that reduction in the efficiency
of D-NHEJ favors PARP-1 dependent end joining and
thus genomic instability and cancer. Finally, the rescue of
LIG4/ lethality and radiosensitivity by Ku knock out
(65,66) can be explained by the relief of the dominant nega-
tive inhibition exerted by Ku on backup end joining in
LIG4/ cells. However, the recent observation that PARP-
1 protects HRR from interference by KU and DNA Ligase
IV (67) also suggests that KU-mediated down regulation of
HRR may partly underlie the above described phenomena.
Finally, it is also possible that defects in SSB repair resulting
from PARP-1 deficiency contribute to the described effects.
More work is needed to discriminate between these possible
contributions.
The biochemical properties of PARP-1 are compatible with
its function in a backup pathway of NHEJ. PARP-1 binds and
becomes activated by double-stranded DNA ends (49,68),
even during V(D)J recombination (56), as it would be antici-
pated by a protein involved in DSB repair. The affinity of
PARP-1 for DNA ends generates an activity analogous to
Ku and offers an alternative mode of recognition of this
type of lesion. Although PARP-1 has been repeatedly impli-
cated in DSB repair, divergent results have hampered the for-
mulation of a consistent model (34,69). Our observations, as
well as those published earlier (22), implicate this activity in
a backup rather in the canonical pathway of end joining and
provide a new dimension for re-evaluating these experiments.
Although inhibition of PARP-1 compromises DSB rejoin-
ing both in the plasmid assay as well as in irradiated cells, the
inhibition is never complete and actually rather limited for
DSBs induced in genomic DNA (Figures 1 and 2). This sug-
gests that rejoining of DSBs remains possible in the absence
of PARP-1 and may be carried out by DNA ligase III,
possibly aided by its zinc finger domain (21,22).
The hierarchical organization of the classical and backup
pathways of end joining may be regulated by interactions
between the participating proteins. Thus, DNA–PKcs is
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in vitro by PARP-1 and this modifica-
tion stimulates DNA–PK activity (70). On the other hand,
DNA–PK suppresses PARP-1 activity but probably not
through the associated phosphorylation (50). Similarly, the
BRCT1 domain of XRCC1 is phosphorylated by DNA–PK
and this phosphorylation causes XRCC1 dimer dissociation
(71). At the same time, interaction between XRCC1 and
DNA–PK stimulates the kinase activity towards p53 (71). It
is notable that all these inputs further consolidate the hierar-
chical organization of end joining by favoring the engagement
of the classical pathway and suppressing the utilization of the
backup pathway.
Our results in aggregate implicate PARP-1 in DSB repair
through participation in a backup pathway together with
DNA Ligase III and possibly XRCC1. This function is enabled
by the considerable affinity of PARP-1 for double-stranded
DNA ends, is under normal conditions competed by Ku and
may further be down-regulated by DNA–PK. Additional
modulation of engagement for DSB repair is afforded by
PARP-1 recruitment to SSB. Our experiments focus on
PARP-1. However among the eighteen potential PARPs in
the mammalian genome, PARP-2 has also been implicated
in repair functions equivalent to those of PARP-1 (24). It
remains to be seen whether PARP-2 can also contribute to
backup end joining of DSBs as suggested here for PARP-1.
