ABSTRACT
Cancer classification is the critical basis for patient-
tailored therapy, while pathway analysis is a prom-
ising method to discover the underlying molecular
mechanisms related to cancer development by using
microarray data. However, linking the molecular
classification and pathway analysis with gene net-
work approach has not been discussed yet. In this
study, we developed a novel framework based on
cancer class-specific gene networks for classifica-
tion and pathway analysis. This framework involves
a novel gene network construction, named ordering
network, which exhibits the power-law node-degree
distribution as seen in correlation networks. The
results obtained from five public cancer datasets
showed that the gene networks with ordering rela-
tionship are better than those with correlation
relationship in terms of accuracy and stability of
the classification performance. Furthermore, we
integrated the ordering networks, classification
information and pathway database to develop the
topology-based pathway analysis for identifying
cancer class-specific pathways, which might be
essential in the biological significance of cancer.
Our results suggest that the topology-based classi-
fication technology can precisely distinguish cancer
subclasses and the topology-based pathway anal-
ysis can characterize the correspondent biochemical
pathways even if there are subtle, but consistent,
changes in gene expression, which may provide new
insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms
of tumorigenesis.
INTRODUCTION
The advance of molecular diagnosis offers a systematic and
precise prospect for cancer classification. One of the typical
methods is DNA microarray technology, which is a powerful
tool in functional genome studies (1–3). Recently, the gene
expression data derived from such analyses have been
employed to many cancer classification studies (4–6).
The studies of gene network have been used in drug dis-
covery (7,8), identification of the signature of disease mecha-
nism (9), analysis of acute systemic inflammation in human
leukocyte (10), investigation of cellular regulatory processes
(11), hub gene analysis (12,13), active pathway extraction
(14), molecular characterization of the cellular state (15)
and so on. In these studies, Segal et al. (16) developed a
module-network approach to identify modules of coregulated
genes by using microarray data, enrichment analysis and
promoter analysis, which is further applied to discover the
signature of the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis (9).
Calvano et al. (10) integrated the structured network
knowledge-base approach, pathway analysis and microarray
data analysis to develop an analytic method of systemic
inflammation. In summary, these gene networks can be
constructed from the correlation between gene expressions
(so-called correlation or relevance network approach)
(15,17,18), module-network approach (9,16,19), structured
network knowledge-based approach (10), Boolean network
approach (20), Bayesian network approach (21), gene-
specific perturbations (7), the analysis and integration of
biological databases (22), promoter element detection (23),
time-series gene expression data (24) and many more.
The correlation networks are based on the linear correla-
tion between the expressions of gene pairs (15,17,18) and
exhibit the power-law node-degree distributions (15). The
power-law distribution is a topology structure of the concen-
tration of links within a few hubs, and is a scale-free network.

This is in contrast to a random network where each node has
the same scale of links (25). The various biological networks
also revealed the power-law node-degree distributions in the
previous studies (15,26,27). In addition, the global topologi-
cal properties of the correlation networks are consistent
with the previously characterized biological networks (15).
However, cells may maintain some conservative ordering
relationships among the genes’ expressions in some situa-
tions, such as flower differentiation (28) and human tumor
progression (29). So far, the gene networks based on ordering
relationship, which remain steady in nonlinear gene regula-
tion system, have not been studied.
Besides the applications described above, the gene net-
works have not been used for systematic cancer classification.
The reason might be that the gene network can be constructed
by the numerous training samples (microarray data), but it
is difficult to construct a new gene network by using a
single test sample and apply to determine its class. In addition
to cancer classification, functional enrichment analysis
regarding pathways is one of the advanced methods using
microarray data to characterize biological processes and
becoming popular (30). How to link the cancer classification
and pathway enrichment analysis together by gene network
approach has not been reported. The objective of this study
was to develop a novel framework that can construct the
gene networks in addition to overcome the above problems
and to perform the topology-based classification and pathway
analysis using microarray data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The software programs, source code and datasets used in this
work are available to download at our web site http://biochip.
nchu.edu.tw/supl/top/.
Public expression datasets
To demonstrate this novel framework, five publicly available
datasets of gene expression profiles were used in this study,
including the ALL-subtype (4), GCM (31), Lung-cancer
(5), Lung-subtype (32) and MLL-leukemia (6) datasets. These
datasets included training and test datasets, except the Lung-
subtype. Therefore, the Lung-subtype dataset was randomly
separated into the training and test datasets, which was
named as Lung-subtype-2 (the original Lung-subtype dataset
was named as Lung-subtype-1). The detailed information
about the datasets is described in Supplementary Data and
Supplementary Table S1. All of the microarray datasets,
without respect to training and test datasets, were simply
processed by clipping the values to a minimum of 0 U and
a maximum of 30 000 U.
Gene selection procedure
All of the genes on the arrays of training dataset were sorted
according to their signal to noise ratio (S2N) (33) values that
correlate with each tumor subclass. The S2N values can be
imagined as the significant level of marker genes. In addition,
1000 times of permutation test were performed on the train-
ing dataset (Figure 1a), and the S2N value of each gene was
re-calculated. Those genes with S2N values less than the sig-
nificant level 0.05 by permutation test were further filtered
out. The top ranking genes were used for topology-based
classification. Gene selection methods can improve the clas-
sification performance (34), which is also the common proce-
dure for most classification applications (4). It is conceivable
that gene selection can increase the accuracy since it may
reduce the noise (35). We applied gene selection on training
dataset to reduce the noise and investigate the influence of
various gene numbers on classification performance.
Networks construction
To construct the gene networks used in topology-based clas-
sification, the correlation and ordering networks were created.
The correlation network construction is based on the Pearson
correlation of all pairwise gene expressions in the dataset.
The detailed procedures of the correlation network construc-
tion are described in Supplementary Data and can be found in
the previous reports (15,36). In this study, the definition of
ordering coefficient of gene pair is modified from our previ-
ous study that developed the generalized index of ordering
coefficient for the semantic structure analysis in the field of
educational measurement and statistics (37). The ordering
network construction is described as follows. The paired
genes would be linked if the level of observed ordering rela-
tionship exceeded the significance level, which could assess
whether the paired genes have consistent ordering relation-
ship of expression intensity in most samples. We defined
the ordering coefficient rij between gene i and j as follows
to measure the ordering relationship level:
g ij ¼ 1 
XN
s¼1
xsi  xsj
 þ
N x max  x minð Þ
½xsi  xsj þ ¼
xsi  xsj xsi > xsj
0 xsi < xsj
‚
 1
where xsi is the expression intensity of gene i in sample s;
N is the total number of samples; xmax and xmin are the
maximum and minimum expression values in the microarray
data, respectively. If xsi < xsj for s ¼ 1, 2, . . . , N (i.e. gene i is
less than gene j in all the samples), then rij ¼ 1 that means
gene i and gene j have consensus ordering relationship in
all the samples.
To determine whether the rij is significant, the ordering
coefficient threshold (r th) was obtained by using permutation
method. The procedure is described as follows: (i) randomly
select two genes and assign to gene i and gene j from
microarray data; (ii) compute the ordering coefficient rij;
(iii) repeat above step 1 and step 2 for 5000 rounds to obtain
a distribution of the ordering coefficient rij and determine
the rth at the significant level 0.05.
Once the ordering coefficient rij between the pair of gene i
and j exceeded the threshold ( rij > rth ), the edge i ! j
(from i to j ) would be created. Therefore, the ordering
networks were directional graphs. An edge i ! j meant the
expression intensity of gene j was larger than gene i in
most situations (samples). So the high input degree of a
gene node implied the relatively high expression level and
vice versa. The ordering networks possessed conservative
topological properties when the networks were created from
the samples of the same subclass of cancer.

Elimination of the common edges
To improve the classification accuracy and obtain the class-
specific networks, we developed the method to eliminate
the common edges (non-class-specific edges). For each sub-
class, a primitive network is constructed from the samples
of this subclass in the training dataset, and each primitive net-
work corresponds to a specific subclass. If an edge (a connec-
tion between two genes) of the network was concurrent on
many various primitive networks, it was called ‘common
edge’, which might decrease the discriminating capacity of
class-specific networks. We also defined the common edge
of a primitive network to occur in 80% of all primitive net-
works (the great majority of the primitive networks). We
established the common edge list by examining all of the
edges of all the primitive networks, and then reconstructed
all the primitive networks by eliminating all of the common
edges. The common edge list would continue to be used in
the further network construction (extension and contraction
networks) in the following procedures.
Topology-based cancer classification framework
A novel topology-based cancer classification framework is
illustrated as Figure 1. The details of classification procedure
are shown in Figure 2 and the pseudo code of the topology-
based classification algorithm can be found in Supplementary
Table S2. In addition, to measure the similarity of network
topology, we investigated the classification performance with
three topological quantities, including degree vector (DV),
clustering coefficient vector (CCV) and weighted adjacency
distribution (WAD), which are described in Supplementary
Data. Due to the well performance of classification, the DV
was chosen for the measurement of the network similarity
in the following description. There are three major steps in
the algorithm and described as follows:
Step 1: primitive gene network construction. First, the net-
work construction method and the elimination of the common
edges, as described above, were utilized to construct the
primitive network of each subclass in the training dataset.
Figure 1. Flowchart of topology-based cancer classification framework. (a) Gene selection by S2N and permutation test is performed in the training dataset.
(b) In order to reduce the noise and investigate the impact of various gene numbers on the classification performance, the microarray data are filtered by the
selected gene list that is derived from the above (a). The topological classification framework includes three major steps: (i) the primitive gene network
construction; (ii) the extension gene network construction and (iii) the computed similarity between the primitive and extension networks for cancer
classification. The primitive networks are also applied to perform hub gene analysis and the calculation of network stability coefficient. A leave-one-out cross-
validation (LOOCV) of the training dataset is performed to obtain a training accuracy before using the test dataset, and the training accuracy can indicate the
quality of the training dataset.

Each subclass of the training dataset can represent a matrix
(each column represents a gene and each row represents a
sample) (see Figure 2). One primitive network corresponded
to one cancer subclass as well as a matrix. The primitive net-
works had the fundamental characters for the corresponding
subclasses of cancer.
Step 2: extension gene network construction. For each test
sample (microarray gene expression data) in the test dataset
that went to classification, all of the matrices in the primitive
networks would be extended for this test sample (see
Figure 2). Thus all of the primitive networks were recon-
structed after adding the test sample into the matrices of all
Figure 2. The diagram of the topology-based classification algorithm. If the sample number of subclass i is Si , then in the matrix of the training dataset, each
column represents a gene (total M genes), and each row represents a sample. gi,j is the gene expression level of the gene i in sample j. Given that the gene
expression data of test sample x is from the test dataset, x takes the subclass with the largest correlation coefficient of R1, R2, . . . , RN . This diagram is just a
representative of the classification procedures for one test sample, since others follow the same way.

the cancer subclasses. These reconstructed networks were
named as the extension networks. Figure 2 shows the method
of the extension network construction. Suppose the test sam-
ple is x, there are N subclasses, and all the primitive networks
are: P1, P2, . . . , PN. Then, we constructed the extension
networks: E1, E2, . . . , EN for the sample x, where Ei is con-
structed from the primitive network Pi and test sample x.
Step 3: cancer classification. The extension networks
(E1, E2, . . . , EN) were constructed for test sample x in step
2. Since the topological quantity for characterizing the net-
work was a DV, the Pearson correlations of the DV between
the primitive networks and the extension networks were
calculated to estimate the network similarity. The pairs of
primitive networks and extension networks were: (P1, E1),
(P2, E2), . . . , (PN, EN), and then a series of correlation
coefficients R1, R2, . . . , RN were generated, where Ri is the
correlation coefficients of the DV between the primitive
network Pi and the extension network Ei. The test sample x
then takes the subclass with the largest correlation coefficient
as the predicted subclass. If the sample x belongs to the sub-
class k, the extension network Ek should have minimum
topology change from Pk. Therefore, the correlation coeffi-
cient Rk of (Pk, Ek) should have the maximum value.
Topology-based pathway analysis
The pathway analyses are the advanced microarray data
analyses, in which the gene lists usually selected from the
stringent criterion. The previous pathway analyses might
ignore the genes without significant differential expression.
We developed a novel method, named topology-based path-
way analysis, which utilizes the topological quantity of the
ordering networks without gene selection for pathway anal-
ysis. In addition, it is a way to demonstrate the biomedical
significance of the ordering networks. The comprehensive
web server CRSD (our previous work) (38) is used to provide
the pathway information in this study (http://biochip.nchu.
edu.tw/crsd1/), which included the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (39,40) and BioCarta (http://
www.biocarta.com) pathways. The method of topology-
based pathway analysis is as follows: (i) analyze all pathways
(KEGG and BioCarta) and extract the gene symbols of each
pathway; (ii) extract the microarray data associated to the
gene symbols of each pathway; (iii) the ordering networks
based on the gene symbols of each pathway are constructed;
(iv) eliminate the common edges using the procedures
described above and (v) compute the topology impact score by
the common and remained edges for each pathway as follows:
topology impact score
¼ e1e2	 	 	 eNðe1 þ ecommÞðe2 þ ecommÞ	 	 	ðeN þ ecommÞ ‚
2
where N is the number of subclass, ei is the remained edge
number of the network of ith subclass, and ecomm is the
number of the common edges.
RESULTS
Selection of topological quantity: the DV
Three topological quantities (DV, CCV and WAD) were
applied to all of the tested datasets for the evaluation of clas-
sification accuracies (see Supplementary Figures S1–S6).
Both the correlation and the ordering network constructions
are included for the performance comparison. Classification
experiments with various selected gene number per subclass
(10, 20, . . . , 100) were performed. The average accuracy, the
best accuracy and the standard deviation of accuracies for
all datasets are shown in Table 1. The average accuracy

can assess the classification accuracy while the standard
deviation of accuracy can assess the stability of the classifica-
tion method.
The results in Table 1 revealed several constructive
information: (i) average accuracy: the best values occurred
on the DV in all six datasets (consider the maximum value
of each row for different topological quantities and networks
in the average accuracies); (ii) standard deviation: there are
four datasets, except for GCM and Lung-subtype-1, having
the minimum values of standard deviation on the DV; (iii)
ordering networks: there are five datasets, except for Lung-
subtype-2, achieving the best average accuracy, and there
are also five datasets, except for the ALL-subtype, having
the minimum standard deviation and (iv) correlation net-
works: there are only two datasets achieving the best average
accuracy, and there are also two datasets having the minimum
standard deviation. Hence, the DV is the best choice and
the ordering networks are obviously much better than the
correlation networks on both accuracy and stability.
Comparison of classification accuracies
A previous report compared the performance of several
machine learning classifiers, including support vector
machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
and Decision Tree, and indicated that SVM is a better
classifier than others (35). To compare the accuracies of
the topology-based classification framework with other
approaches, aside from the classification algorithms previ-
ously published in the tested datasets, the SVM multiclass
(41) was included in this study. The classification accuracies
of the original papers, the SVM multiclass and the topology-
based approach in all of the tested datasets were shown in
Table 2. Top 40 and 80 genes per subclass were selected
based on S2N score with significant level 0.05 in the permu-
tation test. Except for the GCM dataset, the accuracies with
the ordering networks (top 40 genes per subclass) were better
than the originally reported accuracies, and 93% (98% on
average). The ordering networks, without respect to 40 or
80 genes, had better accuracies than the correlation networks
in the ALL-subtype, GCM and Lung-subtype-1 datasets, and
had the same accuracies as the correlation networks in the
Lung-cancer and MLL-leukemia datasets. It was evident
that the ordering network construction is the better approach.
The ordering networks constructed by the top 40 genes also
had the better accuracies than the SVM multiclass in the
GCM and Lung-subtype-2 datasets, and had equal accuracies
in the Lung-cancer and MLL-leukemia datasets. In all the
tested datasets, the accuracies of the ordering networks (top
40 genes per subclass) were between 72 and 100% (93.3%
on average), and better than the accuracies of SVM that
were between 70 and 100% (92.7% on average). Generally
speaking, the classification accuracies of the SVM multiclass
and topology-based ordering network were better than those
of previously published results using the same datasets. How-
ever, both algorithms did not achieve the originally reported
accuracy in the GCM dataset (78%). Interestingly, our results
indicated that the GCM dataset had the minimum network
stability coefficient (NSC, see Supplementary Data), which
imply that accuracy is hard to increase when NSC is low.
Our results also showed that the best classification accuracy
may not occur at the condition of top 40 or 80 genes, but
their performances approximate the best accuracy. Therefore,
classification using the topology-based ordering network is
a stable approach.
To evaluate the true accuracy, sensitivity and specificity
of classification prediction in all of the datasets, as well as
the function of the NSC, the ordering networks and top
40 genes were applied to this study (Supplementary Tables
S3–S8). The average specificities were between 97 and
100% in all the subclasses of all the tested datasets. Except
for the GCM dataset, the true accuracies were between 93
and 100% as well as the average sensitivities were between
96 and 100%. In the ALL-subtype and MLL-leukemia data-
sets, the majority of subclasses had 100% accuracy, sensitiv-
ity and specificity. For example, there were four subclasses
that had 100% true accuracy and five subclasses with 100%
sensitivity and specificity in the ALL-subtype dataset.
Large-scale gene networks and power-law
node-degree distribution
We further investigated the properties of the topology-
based framework with either the ordering or correlation
networks on the construction of large-scale gene networks
and the power-law node-degree distribution. As illustrated
in Figure 3a, the results showed that the classification accu-
racies of the ordering networks were better than those of the
correlation networks in all of the tested datasets while the
networks were large-scale. Furthermore, the ALL-subtype
dataset was used to verify the power-law node-degree distri-
bution property in the large-scale ordering and correlation
gene networks (Figure 3b). The ordering networks of the
ALL-subtype dataset had the degree exponent r between
1.72 and 1.96, and determination coefficient R2 > 0.84
(0.91 on average), and the correlation networks had the
degree exponent r between 2.76 and 3.10 and R2 > 0.68
(0.79 on average). In contrast, R2 were between 0.32 and

topology-based ordering networks also possessed power-law

Hub gene and topology-based pathway analysis
The details of hub gene analysis method are described in
Supplementary Data. The hub gene annotations and the
adjacency matrices of the ordering networks in the ALL-
subtype, Lung-subtype-1 and Lung-cancer datasets are avail-
able at our web site (http://biochip.nchu.edu.tw/supl/top).
To demonstrate the availability of topology-based pathway
analysis, the Lung-cancer dataset was selected for verifica-
tion. There are two classes in the Lung-cancer dataset: malig-
nant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and lung adenocarcinoma
(AD). These two contained 181 tissue samples (31 MPM
and 150 AD), of which 31 MPM and 31 AD samples were

correlation networks. All of the tested datasets exhibit the classification accuracy profiles of the large-scale networks. The solid circle represents the ordering
network, while the solid triangle represents the correlation network. The accuracy of the correlation networks decreased and became high variance while the
network size increased and the gene number was in excess of some threshold. (b) The ALL-subtype dataset is used to verify the power-law node-degree
distribution property in the ordering and correlation networks. These are the log-log plots of degree K versus the number of nodes with degree > K i.e. P(K), and
there are 6602 genes in the both ordering and correlation networks. The linear regression measures the linearity between log[P(K)] and log(K), which is a
condition of the power-law node-degree distribution, where P(K) can be represented by power-law with a degree exponent r : P(K) 
 Kr. The determination
coefficient R2 ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect linearity (i.e. a perfect power-law distribution). The permuted network is constructed by randomly
permuting all of the edges from the T-ALL subclass network. The degree exponent r and determination coefficient R2 of each subclass-specific network are
shown in Supplementary Table S9.

selected to construct the ordering networks and correlation
networks. We analyzed 115 KEGG and 317 BioCarta path-
ways, and there were remained 102 KEGG and 208 BioCarta
pathways after filtering the pathways with the gene number
less than 8. We sketched the ordering networks for 310 path-
ways (see our web site http://biochip.nchu.edu.tw/supl/top),
and the ordering networks of the top two pathways, by
the topology impact score, were shown in Figure 4a and c,
in which the networks include MPM- and AD- specific net-
works. Also, the correlation networks of these two pathways
were also shown in Figure 4b and d. MPM- and AD-specific
networks in each pathway, eicosanoid and ascorbate/aldarate
metabolisms, showed that the network topology had apparent
differences between two class-specific networks, as well as
between the hub genes.
DISCUSSION
Both the molecular classification and the pathway analysis
based on microarray data are the advanced approaches to
Figure 4. The ordering and correlation network diagrams for the significant pathways. The Lung-cancer dataset was used for topology-based pathway analysis,
and the two significant pathways, derived from the BioCarta and KEGG pathway databases, respectively. (a) Ordering networks of eicosanoid metabolism;
(b) correlation networks of eicosanoid metabolism; (c) ordering networks of ascorbate and aldarate metabolism; (d) correlation networks of ascorbate and
aldarate metabolism. Two class-specific networks (MPM and AD) are shown for each pathway. The network topology reveals the apparent difference between
the two class-specific networks, as well as the change of the hub gene. In the ordering networks, the hub gene is ALOX5 in AD but is PTGS1 in MPM (a); the hub
gene is CYP26A1 in AD but is ALDH1A2 in MPM (c).

characterize the biological properties and processes. In this
report, we presented a novel and highly efficient computa-
tional framework for topology-based classification by using
microarray data, which is a simple and stable approach.
The classification accuracies of the original papers, the
SVM multiclass, and the topology-based approach were
reported in this study. The SVM classifier constructs a com-
plicated mapping between samples and their class labels,
which functions as a black box (42,43); therefore the inside
information of SVM classifier cannot interpret biological sig-
nificance. Although the SVM (for gene selection) and enrich-
ment analysis can be integrated to perform pathway analysis,
which might ignore the genes that play important role in cer-
tain pathways but without significant differential expression
in different classes. The results of this type of pathway anal-
ysis might be difficult to interpret the biological significance.
In contrast, the ordering network construction was not only
utilized to the classification, but also can benefit the biologi-
cal pathway analysis, hub gene analysis and visualization.
In this study, we first utilized the correlation network for
developing the topology-based classification. The classifica-
tion performance of the correlation networks was impressive
in some conditions. However, their accuracy and stability in
all of the tested datasets are not very good, particularly in
large-scale gene networks (see Figure 3a). The correlation
networks are linear relationship but the gene regulations are
almost nonlinear (44,45), which might be a reason to affect
the accuracy and stability. Therefore, we further developed
the ordering network construction for classification. The
ordering relationship developed in this study is a nonlinear
measurement, which may add some information in the anal-
ysis of complex gene regulation system. Our results showed
that the topology-based ordering networks are suitable for a
classification study based on gene expression profiles and
may help to interpret biological meanings through pathway
analysis.
It is undoubted that cells may maintain some conservative
ordering relationships among the essential genes in some situ-
ations, which may be more important than the correlation
relationships. For example, flower identities are tightly modu-
lated by three groups of genes, which are well known as ABC
model in Arabidopsis thaliana and many other plant species.
The ordering relationships of the three groups of gene expres-
sions can dramatically affect flower differentiation and devel-
opment. The tissue will differentiate into sepals and petals
when the expression level of group A is higher than group
C; in contrast, if the ordering relationship is reversed as
group C > A, the same tissue can develop into stamens and
carpels (28). Another example is the ordering relationship
of CDH1 (E-cadherin) and CDH2 (N-cadherin), which has
biomedical significance in human tumor progression (29).
CDH1 is expressed abundantly but the expression of CDH2
is not detected in prostate glandular epithelium (CDH1 >
CDH2). However, human prostate carcinoma cell lines
show loss of CDH1 and expression of CDH2 (CDH1 <
CDH2) (29). Thus, the ordering relationship of gene expres-
sion levels between CDH1 and CDH2 is reversed in different
class. It is evident that the ordering networks could play some
roles in interpreting the biological significance.
Currently, many methods on gene network constructions
do not allow establishing large-scale networks because of
the limitation of biological databases (27), the high time
complex (36) and the noise accumulation (35) during the
large-scale network construction. Real gene networks are
very complex and enormous, so the capability of large-
scale network analysis is very important. It is evident that
the topology-based framework with ordering relationship
can handle large-scale networks very well (see Figure 3a).
The accuracy of the correlation networks decreased and
was highly variable when the network size increased. There-
fore, the ordering networks may tolerate the noise accumula-
tion efficiently in large-scale networks. The performances of
the ordering networks are better in accuracy and stability in
all of the tested datasets when the networks are large-scale.
To further investigate the topological properties of the
ordering networks, we analyzed the power-law node-degree
distribution property of the ordering and correlation gene net-
works. The log-log plots of degree K versus the number of
nodes with degree > K are shown in Figure 3b. The topologi-
cal properties of interactome maps usually possess the degree
exponent r between 1.59 and 2.75 and determination coeffi-
cient R2 > 0.84, as seen in several experimental datasets
(27). In the ALL-subtype dataset, the ordering networks
have the degree exponent r between 1.72 and 1.96 and
R2 > 0.84, and the correlation networks have the degree
exponent r between 2.76 and 3.10 and R2 > 0.68 (see
Figure 3b and Supplementary Table S9). Our results sug-
gested that the ordering networks have stronger power-law
distribution property and are consistent with the previous
study (27). Although, the various biological networks
revealed the power-law node-degree distributions in the pre-
vious studies (15,26,27), it is unproven that this property
could be as a criterion to assess the quality of gene network
construction.
The ordering network construction is also low in time com-
plexity. We compared the execution time of topology-based
classification between ordering networks and correlation
networks by using the top 40 and 200 genes per subclass
(see Supplementary Table S10). The results revealed that
the average execution time of the ordering networks con-
structed by the top 40 and 200 genes decreased 6 and 24%
as compared with those of the correlation networks, respec-
tively. Therefore, the larger the network size, the better the
performance of the ordering network.
Genes with a high degree of connections with other genes
may dominate the network topology and are the hub genes of
the network, which are the critical genes in a network (15).
Most genes are connected to the hub genes by a relatively
short path (12,13). In this study, we analyzed the node-degree
distributions of the ordering networks to demonstrate its bio-
logical significance by the previous literature reports in three
datasets, including the ALL-subtype, Lung-subtype-1 and
Lung-cancer. A total of 52 genes were selected as the hub
genes of the ALL-subtype dataset, 42 as the hub genes of
the Lung-subtype-1 dataset, and 24 as the hub genes of the
Lung-cancer dataset (see Supplementary Tables S11–S19).
These three datasets were derived from the microarray
experiments using Affymetrix GeneChip array HG_U95Av2,
U95Av2, and the gene annotation was obtained from the
Affymetrix web site. The adjacency matrices of these net-
works were available at our web site http://biochip.nchu.

input and output degree distributions, and the corresponding
subclass were shown in Supplementary Tables S11–S19. Fur-
thermore, the network diagrams for the hub genes are shown
in Supplementary Figure S7 and S8. The results showed that
some previous reports can support the biological significance
of the hub genes in the ordering networks, especially the
genes that have been previously characterized as the subclass-
specific markers, such as CD3D (4), CBFA2T3 (46), TRB@
(47) and so on. The detailed information about the hub
gene analysis is described in Supplementary Data.
Functional enrichment analysis with pathways is one of the
advanced microarray data analyses that is becoming popular,
in which the gene lists usually selected from the stringent cri-
terion, e.g. P-value < 0.05 or fold-change > 2 (30). Then the
pathway analysis may identify the underlying biological
mechanisms of these gene lists. There are several statistical
methods that can be utilized to analyze the intersection of a
gene list and a pathway or functional annotation, e.g. the
fisher exact test (48), hypergeometric distribution (49) and
binomial distribution (50). These analyses might ignore the
genes that play important role in certain pathways but without
significant differential expression in different classes. Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a statistical method to
detect the subtle difference of individual genes but coordinate
changes in the groups of functionally related genes (51). The
results of GSEA may be difficult to interpret (30), and there
have also been some statistical debate regarding GSEA (52).
Therefore, we developed topology-based pathway analysis,
which integrates the pathway database, the classification
information, the topological quantity and all microarray
data without significant differential gene selection. The
results can be visualized and be employed to interpret the bio-
logical meanings easily.
It is a challenge to characterize the biological process in
which the genes’ expressions are subtle but consistent
changes. The topology-based pathway analysis utilizes the
topology change among the ordering gene networks of the
different classes to discover class-specific pathways. To dem-
onstrate the biomedical significance of the ordering networks
applied to topology-based pathway analysis, the Lung-cancer
dataset containing MPM and AD was employed to this study.
The top 10 significant pathways were selected from KEGG
pathways (see Supplementary Table S20) and the top 20 sig-
nificant pathways were selected from BioCarta pathways by
the topology impact score (see Supplementary Table S21).
High topology impact score of pathway indicated high
variance between subclasses. The top significant pathway in
BioCarta, by the topology impact score, was eicosanoid
metabolism, and the top significant pathway in KEGG was
ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. To illustrate the signifi-
cant different network topology, the ordering and correlation
networks of these two pathways were shown in Figure 4.
The ordering networks are directional graphs and illustrate
the relative expression levels and ordering structures in the
networks, which have not been discussed yet. On the other
hand, the correlation networks are non-directional graphs,
which have been discussed in various aspects (15–18). We
believe both the ordering networks and the correlation net-
works have important biological implications.
The eicosanoid metabolism is the important pathway in
non-small cell lung-cancer (NSCLC) (53,54). In previous
studies, several genes in the eicosanoid metabolism have
been investigated in AD or MPM, such as PTGIS (5,54),
PTGS1 (55), PTGS2 (53,55) and ALOX5 (53). The previous
report demonstrated increased expression of PTGS2 (Cox-2)
and simultaneous down-regulation of PTGS1 (Cox-1) in
NSCLC (55). Our results showed that PTGS2 has 0 degree
in AD and 3 output degrees in MPM, and PTGS1 has 0 degree
in AD and 10 input degrees in MPM (Figure 4a), which
meant the relatively high expression level of PTGS2 and rela-
tively low expression level of PTGS1 in AD. On the other
hand, both CYP24A1 and AKR1B10 are involved in the ascor-
bate and aldarate metabolism and have been demonstrated to
be highly expressed in AD (56,57). Our results showed that
both CYP24A1 and AKR1B10 have 0 degree in AD and 2 out-
put degrees in MPM (Figure 4c), which meant the relatively
high expression level in AD. The detailed information of other
significant pathways is described in Supplementary Data.
The traditional analysis for microarray data usually filters
out the genes with no significant differential expression in
different classes. In order to understand whether the signifi-
cant pathways contained any significant genes, we investi-
gated the relationship between the 200 significant genes
derived from S2N selection with permutation test (see our
web site http://biochip.nchu.edu.tw/supl/top) and the 30 sig-
nificant pathways (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21) in
the Lung-cancer dataset. There are nine significant pathways
that do not contain any significant gene, and the complete list
is described in Supplementary Data. Although the genes of
these nine pathways are not significant, our results revealed
that the local network structures of the pathways are signifi-
cantly changed. For example, some of these pathways have
been proved their biological significance by the previous
reports, such as the CBL mediated ligand-induced down-
regulation of EGF receptors and the erythrocyte differentia-
tion pathway (see Supplementary Data). It is possible that a
gene with subtle change can still contribute to the complex
regulatory mechanism, and impact on the local network struc-
ture. The topology-based pathway analysis using the ordering
network is the novel approach to observe the behavior of the
local networks, and it can discover the impact on the local
network structure.
In summary, we have developed the topology-based classi-
fication framework and pathway analysis by using the order-
ing networks. The accuracy and stability of the classification
performance were demonstrated in the topology-based classi-
fication. Because of literature reports, the hub genes and sig-
nificant pathways based on the ordering networks have the
potential biological significance. In addition, according to
the significant difference of the hub genes and significant
pathways between subclasses, they can help to discover
new insights in the underlying molecular mechanisms related
to disease development.
