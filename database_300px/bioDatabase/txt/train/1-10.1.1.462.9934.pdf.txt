Abstract—Over 50 percent of manual wheelchair users with
spinal cord injury (SCI) are likely to develop upper-limb pain
and injury. The majority of studies related to pain have impli-
cated wheelchair propulsion as a cause. This paper draws from
a large multisite trial and a long-standing research program to
make specific recommendations related to wheelchair propul-
sion that may decrease the risk of upper-limb injury. The stud-
ies include over 60 subjects over 1 yr after a traumatic SCI
below the second thoracic level. Specific aspects of the propul-
sive stroke that may relate to injury include cadence, magni-
tude of force, and the pattern of the hand during the
nonpropulsive part of the stroke. Lower peak forces, slower
cadence, and a circular propulsive stroke in which the hand
falls below the pushrim during recovery may help prevent
injury. In addition, wheelchair users should use the lightest
weight adjustable wheelchair possible. Future work should
include interventional trials and larger studies that allow for
more complex statistical models that can further detail the rela-
tionship between wheelchair propulsion, user characteristics,
and upper-limb injuries.

INTRODUCTION
For many individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI),
independence depends on the integrity of their upper limbs

JRRD, Volume 42, Number 3, 2005, Supplement 1transfers place great demands on the bones, joints, and
soft tissues of the upper limbs. These essential activities
can hasten the aging process, leading to injury and pain
[2]. Cross-sectional studies have reported the prevalence
of shoulder pain in individuals with SCI to be between
31 and 73 percent [3–6] and the prevalence of carpal
tunnel syndrome (CTS) to be between 49 and 73 percent
[7–10]. In all these studies, the authors suggest that the
repetitive trauma associated with wheelchair propulsion
and transfers is, in part, responsible for these injuries.
The impact of pain is considerable. In one of the
largest studies on upper-limb pain, Sie et al. found that
significant pain was present in 59 percent of individuals
with tetraplegia and 41 percent of individuals with para-
plegia [11]. Significant pain was defined as pain requir-
ing analgesic medication, pain associated with two or
more activities of daily living, or pain severe enough to
result in cessation of activity. The tasks most commonly
associated with upper-limb pain in individuals with SCI
(e.g., work/school, transfers, outdoor wheeling, and
driving) are the activities necessary for independence
and community integration [1,3,12–13]. As these previ-
ously mastered activities become more difficult, the sec-
ondary disabilities they cause may further affect the
individual’s adjustment, self-perception, and involve-
ment in satisfying and rewarding activities [2]. Lun-
dqvist et al. found that pain was the only factor
correlated with lower quality-of-life scores [14].
Preventing upper-limb pain in wheelchair users may
be possible. A body of literature exists in the area of
ergonomics that is often used to prevent injuries in
workers. Task performance modification based on ergo-
nomic analysis has been proven to reduce the incidence
of pain and cumulative trauma disorders of the upper
limb in various work settings [15–20]. This paper
reviews the aspects of pushrim biomechanics relevant to
injury prevention. By design, we focus on work and
methods completed at the University of Pittsburgh and
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pittsburgh
Healthcare System and with our partners in a collabora-
tive study, Collaboration on Upper Limb Pain in SCI
(CULP-SCI). The CULP-SCI is a multisite study funded
jointly by the VA and the Department of Education. Col-
laborative partners with the University of Pittsburgh
include the University of Washington and the Kessler
Medical Rehabilitation Research and Education Corpo-
ration (West Orange, NJ). The lead investigators are
authors on this paper. During the discussion, and as part
of the methods, we introduce in other literature; how-
ever, our intent is not to comprehensively review, but
rather to derive practice recommendations based on our
work.
METHODS
All the studies discussed in the Table have common
components of data collection. What is presented here is
a brief summary. For greater detail on the methodology
and data analysis, refer to the individual studies.
Subject Recruitment
In each study, subjects were recruited from two pri-
mary sources: wheelchair vendors and discharge records
following initial inpatient rehabilitation from inpatient
SCI units in the region. In each instance, a letter was sent
to the individuals requesting that they participate in the
research study. Subjects were recruited in this manner so
all individuals with SCI could be identified, not just those
currently being followed through regular clinic visits. To
be included in the studies, subjects had to have a trau-
matic SCI at the second thoracic level or below occurring
>1 yr before to the start of the study. Subjects were not
excluded if they had pain, unless they reported that pain
interfered with their ability to propel a wheelchair. These
individuals needed to use a manual wheelchair with 24 in.
wheels full-time for mobility and be able to provide
informed consent. All subjects in all studies provided
written informed consent prior to participation in the
study and in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh
and Department of Veteran’s Affairs Institutional Review
Board requirements. The Table summarizes the subject
characteristics for the CULP-SCI papers referenced.
Kinematic System
Two Optotrak three-camera motion-analysis systems
by Northern Digital, Inc. (Waterloo, Canada), were used
for this component of data collection (Figure 1 shows the
complete laboratory setup). These systems can collect
real-time three-dimensional (3-D) data. The use of two
cameras enabled visualization of both sides of the sub-
jects. Markers were attached to the skin as shown in
Figure 2. Markers were also attached to the chest wall
and the temporal-mandibular joint. All kinematic data
were collected at 60 Hz.

BONINGER et al. Pushrim biomechanics and injury preventionKinetic System
The SMARTWheel (Three Rivers Holdings, LLC,
Mesa, AZ) was used for the collection of kinetic data.
The SMARTWheel can measure 3-D forces and moments
occurring at the pushrim [21]. SMARTWheels were placed
on both sides of each subject’s wheelchair. Use of the
SMARTWheels did not change the camber, axle position,
or diameter of the subjects’ normal pushrim.
Wheelchair Dynamometer
After the subject’s wheelchair was fitted with
SMARTWheels, the wheelchair was secured to a wheelchair
dynamometer. Subjects propelled their wheelchairs on the
dynamometer to acclimate themselves to the experimental
setup. The resistance of the dynamometer is comparable to
rolling over a tile surface [22]. Subjects pushed their
wheelchairs at different speeds (0.9 m/s, 1.8 m/s, and a
self-selected speed). Propulsion speed was displayed on a
17 in. computer screen placed in front of the subjects. Sub-
jects were asked to propel until they reached a steady state
as determined by the investigators; upon reaching steady
state, subject data were collected for 20 s. The subjects
rested approximately 1 min between trials, while the
kinetic and kinematic data were checked for errors. The
kinetic data were filtered at 30 Hz. The filter was an
eighth-order, zero-phase, digital Butterworth type [23].
Kinematic Analysis
To determine stroke patterns, we plotted the x- and y-
coordinate positions of the third metacarpophalangeal joint
for each subject, and a single investigator reviewed the
patterns and classified them into semicircular, single
loop-over-propulsion, double loop-over-propulsion, and
arcing (Figure 3). For studies of wrist motion, a local

JRRD, Volume 42, Number 3, 2005, Supplement 1coordinate system for the wrist was developed [24]. The
first axis was defined as a line pointing from the midpoint
between the radial and ulnar styloids to the third metacar-
pophalangeal joint. The second axis was defined as perpen-
dicular to the first axis and pointed out of the back of the
hand/wrist. Rotations about this axis represented ulnar and
radial deviation. The third axis was defined as perpendicu-
lar to the plane formed by the first two axes, and pointed
from the midpoint of the wrist through the radial styloid.
Movements about this axis represented flexion and exten-
sion. Wrist angles were averaged over the first five strokes.
Kinetic Analysis
For each stroke, the SMARTWheel provided forces
and moments in three global reference planes. The result-
ant force, which is the total force applied to the pushrim,
was calculated by vector addition of Fx , Fy, and Fz
[21,25]. We rotated the global force components, Fx and
Fy, to obtain a radial force component directed toward
the axle of the wheel and a tangential force component
directed tangential to the pushrim [25]. We computed the
rate of rise of the resultant force by taking the derivative
of the resultant force with respect to time and then deter-
mining the maximum value during the first third of the
stroke to capture initial impact loading on the pushrim.
All calculations were completed with MATLAB (The
MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). Key kinetic
variables of resultant force, frequency, and rate of rise of
resultant force were calculated from the first five strokes
collected at steady state. The mean of the variables was
then obtained to give a single value for each variable at

Nerve Conduction Studies
Each subject had bilateral upper-limb nerve conduc-
tion studies (NCSs) as described by Boninger et al. [26].
All NCSs were completed by one of three American
Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine-certified techni-
cians blinded to other subject information. Motor and
sensory studies of the both the median and ulnar nerve
were completed. Median nerve damage, which would be
indicated by lower amplitude and longer latency
responses, is the underlying pathology for CTS. Subjects
were dropped subjects from the analysis if all median and

peripheral polyneuropathy.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Force
Peak forces should be minimized during wheelchair
propulsion. The first study of 34 subjects with paraplegia
found a significant relationship between weight and func-
tion of the median nerve. However, weight is related to
rolling resistance, and therefore force needed to propel a
wheelchair (Figure 4). In addition, both height and
weight are related to median nerve function [32–33].
Height, weight, and weight-normalized pushrim forces
were successfully incorporated into linear regression
models predicting median nerve sensory amplitude and
latency. For both models, higher weight-normalized
forces corresponded with worse median nerve function
[26]. The specific force variable that was most signifi-
cantly related to median nerve function was rate of rise of
resultant force. Individuals who more rapidly loaded the
pushrim during the propulsive stroke had worse median
nerve function.
In work not yet published, we again found force to be
related to risk of median nerve injury. In this study, 23
manual wheelchair users with paraplegia were tested
twice, an average of 3.4 yr apart. NCSs were completed at
each test session and a biomechanical analysis of propul-
sion was completed at the first session. Using a regression
model, we once again found force to be a factor in pro-
gression of median nerve injury over time. When we
forced median motor latency at time one into the statisti-
cal model, peak weight normalized resultant force posi-
tively correlated with median motor latency at the end of
testing, or time two (p < 0.01). Thus, people who pushed
with greater force relative to body weight had worsening
of NCSs over time. Although not definitive, the findings
support the theory that wheelchair propulsion technique
can lead to adverse changes in the median nerve.
Cadence
Cadence or push frequency should also be mini-
mized during wheelchair propulsion. This recommenda-
tion is based on the 1999 study by Boninger et al. [26]. In
addition to peak forces and rate of rise of force being
correlated with impaired median nerve function, Boninger
et al. also saw a relationship with frequency. Increasing
frequency was significantly related to lower median
amplitude (p < 0.01).
The relationship with frequency was further clarified
in a recent paper related to wrist motion [27]. In this
study, the relationship between wrist motion and median
and ulnar nerve function was investigated in 35 individu-
als with paraplegia. Increased wrist flexion and extension
range of motion was related to higher median and ulnar
nerve amplitudes, or less nerve injury. To explain these
findings, we looked at the relationship between range of
motion and cadence, as well as force. Greater range of
motion was associated with lower cadence and force.
Recovery Patterns
When propelling a wheelchair, the user should let the
hand drift below the pushrim during the recovery phase
(Figure 3). The recovery pattern is the path the hand fol-
lows when not on the pushrim. In two separate studies,
Boninger et al. [28] and Shimada et al. [29], we have
investigated the relationship between the recovery pat-
tern and biomechanics. Figure 3 presents the recovery
patterns discussed in the Boninger et al. 2002 publication
involving 38 subjects [28]. In this study, we found that
the single-loop-over propulsion was the most common
pattern. However, the semicircular pattern was associated
with a lower cadence and the greatest time spent in pro-
pulsion relative to recovery. In other words, wheelchair
users who followed a semicircular pattern hit the pushrim

BONINGER et al. Pushrim biomechanics and injury preventionless frequently and used more of the pushrim to go the
same speed.
Wheelchair Factors
Wheelchair users should be provided with the light-
est adjustable wheelchairs possible. Body weight has
been found to relate to injuries at both the wrist and
shoulder. In addition, the known relationship between
weight and rolling resistance means that heavier wheel-
chairs require the user to push with more force. Adjust-
ability is another key factor in assuring good wheelchair
biomechanics. In an analysis of 40 individuals with SCI,
we found that individuals who had their axles further for-
ward with respect to the shoulder had a slower cadence
and a decrease in rate of rise of the resultant force [30].
As stated previously, both findings have been associated
with median nerve injury. The height of the axle with
respect to the shoulder is also important. Decreasing the
vertical distance between the shoulder and axle enables
more of the pushrim to be available for the propulsive
stroke. This results in greater push angles and allows
force to be imparted to the wheelchair pushrim for a
longer time, thus decreasing the frequency of propulsion
necessary to maintain speed. Figure 5 summarizes these
findings. However, too low a position can cause exces-
sive abduction at the shoulder.
Subject Factors
Subjects should be advised to avoid weight gain and
be aware that women may be at greater risk of shoulder
injury. Our studies have found that subject weight and
gender may impact risk of injury [31,34]. We tracked 14
wheelchair users with SCI for an average of 2.5 yr and
found that females were much more likely to have pro-
gression of shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
abnormalities than males (p = 0.001) [31]. In this study,
half the subjects showed progression of MRI abnormali-
ties. Six of the seven with progression were women, and
no women in the group improved or stayed the same [31].
Subject weight was correlated to injury in a number
of our studies. In an analysis of 28 individuals, all of
whom had MRIs and X rays of the shoulder, we found
body weight to be positively correlated to the number of
imaging abnormalities seen in both X ray (p < 0.01) and
MRI (p < 0.01) [34]. In addition, we found body weight
to be related to median nerve injury in the studies out-
lined under the cadence and force paragraphs above [26].
As noted previously, individuals who weigh more use
more force to push their wheelchairs, which increases
their risk of developing upper-limb injuries.
DISCUSSION
This paper outlines scientific evidence from the
CULP-SCI group for practical recommendations related
to wheelchair setup and propulsion. Based on the infor-
mation provided here, we recommend that wheelchair
users be instructed to take long, smooth propulsive
strokes that use as much of the pushrim as possible.
When releasing the rim, the user should let the hand drift
below the pushrim during the recovery stage. Long,
smooth strokes should minimize both the cadence and the
peak forces applied. By design, the results and recom-
mendations given here were based on work completed at
the University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh VA and
were not intended to be a systematic literature review.
However, in a number of areas, other literature relates to
our recommendations, briefly discussed next.

JRRD, Volume 42, Number 3, 2005, Supplement 1Three large evidence-based reviews have been con-
ducted of the link between repetitive tasks and upper-limb
injury. In 1997, the National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) reviewed the epidemiologic
evidence of this link [35]. In 1999, the National Research
Council (NRC) published “Work-related musculoskeletal
disorders: a review of the evidence” [36]. In 2001, the
NRC, together with the Institute of Medicine, completed a
review, “Musculoskeletal disorders and the workplace”
[37]. These comprehensive reviews have found strong
links between work activities, physiologic and psycho-
physical conditions at work, and injury.
One conclusion from these comprehensive reviews is
that limiting the frequency of repetitive tasks should
reduce the risk of injury. A number of studies have
strongly implicated frequency of task completion as a
risk factor for repetitive strain injury and/or pain at the
wrists [38–41] and shoulder [42–44]. Although the
majority of studies are correlative and do not prove
cause-and-effect relationships, longitudinal work has
found similar results [45]. Wheelchair propulsion, with
strokes occurring approximately once per second,
exceeds what the majority of studies consider a frequent
task. For instance, a study by Silverstein et al. found
greater prevalence of CTS in workers with highly repeti-
tive jobs [39]. In the Silverstein study, a cycle time of
<30 s was considered high frequency. Wheelchair propul-
sion cycle time is usually <1 s [25]. If a wheelchair user
pushes his or her chair 16 min/day, he or she will exceed
the number of repetitions a factory worker in a high-cycle
task would complete in an 8 h day.
Another conclusion that can be drawn from the
reviews and the ergonomics literature is that peak forces
should be minimized during wheelchair propulsion.
Higher forces during tasks are correlated with injuries
and/or pain at the wrist [38–39,41] and shoulder [43–44].
Longitudinal studies have also found that higher loads or
high-force work predicts risk of development of pain or
injury [45–47]. The forces defined as “high” in these
studies are almost always exceeded during wheelchair
propulsion [25]. For example, one study defined high
force as 39 N [39]. Wheelchair users propel with forces
routinely over 70 N [26]. Another study noted that pull-
ing or pushing a mass over 50 kg was related to shoulder
pain [48]. Clearly, the average individual with SCI
weighs much more than 50 kg (110 lb). Maintaining an
ideal body weight is one way to minimize forces during
wheelchair propulsion and transfers.
The recommendation to increase the length of pro-
pulsion stroke and decrease frequency could lead to
increased range of motion at the wrist, and some ergo-
nomics literature indicates that increased range of motion
could lead to injury. However, the 1997 NIOSH review
indicated that insufficient evidence exists of a link
between wrist range of motion, or posture, and injury
[35]. The finding that increased range of motion at the
wrist was associated with lower forces and frequency fur-
ther explains our findings of less nerve injury in those
who use greater range of motion [27]. The range of
motion found in our study [27] and a Rao et al. study [49]
does not include extreme wrist angles, where the wrist is
likely more prone to injury.
Less information is available in support of the exact
recovery pattern to use. Recent work found that when sub-
jects without disability were trained in both the semicircu-
lar and the arc style of propulsion, the arc or pumping
style was more mechanically efficient (arc = 7.1 percent
vs. semicircular = 6.7 percent) [50]. This same study also
found increased cadence with the arc style (range 61–70)
compared to the semicircular style (range 53–56). Because
the arc style results in a greater than 18 percent increase in
cadence, we recommend the semicircular style, despite the
6 percent decrease in mechanical efficiency. However, we
emphasize that taking long, smooth propulsive strokes is
likely the most important advice to give.
Many authors have made strong arguments for pro-
viding wheelchair users with the lightest weight adjust-
able wheelchairs possible. One study directly compared
ultralight and depot wheelchairs and found that when
using an ultralight wheelchair, individuals with SCI
pushed at faster speeds, traveled longer distances, and
used less energy [51]. This was believed to be due in part
to lower rolling resistance secondary to decreased
weight. Another factor that can contribute to lower
rolling resistance is a higher quality chair, which likely
has better wheelchair components such as tires and bear-
ings, as well as better long-term maintenance. A more
forward axle position has been found to decrease rolling
resistance and improve efficiency [52–53]. A lower seat
position has been associated with greater upper-limb
motions [53–54], greater hand contact angles [30,54],
lower frequency, and higher mechanical efficiency [54].
Because axle position affects stability [55], the wheel-
chair should be set up with the axle as far forward as pos-
sible, provided the patient feels stable. The best seat
height is the point at which the elbow is flexed between
17
BONINGER et al. Pushrim biomechanics and injury prevention100° and 120° when the hand is resting on the top dead
center of the pushrim [30,54]. An alternative method that
can be used to approximate the same position and angle
is to have the individual rest with arms hanging at the
side so that the fingertips are at the center of rear wheel
hub.
Note that the results and recommendations stated in
this article are based on the analysis of approximately 60
manual wheelchair users with paraplegia from the Pitts-
burgh area. Although this is a large number of subjects
compared to most articles on wheelchair users and most
biomechanics studies, much more could be learned from
a larger study. In addition, these studies were limited to
wheelchair users with paraplegia, who may not represent
wheelchair users with other disabilities. While we believe
that these findings are applicable to manual wheelchair
users with other disabilities, caution should be exercised
when applying the results to other groups. Furthermore,
most of the results are based on biomechanics at the push-
rim and injury at the wrist. Modeling that allows for
determination of forces and moments at specific joints
will likely provide additional insight.
Based on the work presented in this paper, the U.S.
Department of Education, through the National Institute
for Disability and Rehabilitation Research and through
the Department of Veterans Affairs, awarded funding to
the CULP-SCI for a multicenter study of wheelchair bio-
mechanics. This longitudinal study will involve over
150 subjects and will combine epidemiologic and biome-
chanical methods. We are hopeful that this study will fur-
ther define the relationship between upper-limb injury
and both wheelchair propulsion biomechanics and sub-
ject and wheelchair characteristics. We also hope that this
multisite study will lead to further recommendations that
may help prevent upper-limb pain and injury in manual
wheelchair users.
CONCLUSION
Substantial scientific evidence is available that sup-
ports specific recommendations related to the type of man-
ual wheelchair an individual should receive, how it should
be set up, and how it should be propelled. Continued work
is needed to strengthen this evidence. In addition, work
should begin on interventional trials to see if applying
these recommendations results in positive changes for
patients who rely on manual wheelchairs.
