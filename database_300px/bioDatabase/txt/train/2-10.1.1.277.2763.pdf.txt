ABSTRACT
2-Deoxyribonolactone (L) and 2-deoxyribose (AP) are
abasic sites that are produced by ionizing radiation,
reactive oxygen species and a variety of DNA damag-
ing agents. The biological processing of the AP site
has been examined in the yeast Saccharomyces cere-
visiae. However, nothing is known about how L is pro-
cessed in this organism. We determined the bypass
and mutagenic specificity of DNA containing an aba-
sic site (AP and L) or the AP analog tetrahydrofuran (F)
using an oligonucleotide transformation assay. The
tetrahydrofuran analog and L were bypassed at 10-
fold higher frequencies than the AP lesions. Bypass
frequencies of lesions were greatly reduced in the
absence of Rev1 or Polz (rev3 mutant), but were only
marginally reduced in the absence of Polh (rad30
mutant). Deoxycytidine was the preferred nucleotide
inserted opposite an AP site whereas dA and dC
were inserted at equal frequencies opposite F and L
sites. In the rev1 and rev3 strains, dA was the pre-
dominant nucleotide inserted opposite these lesions.
Overall, we conclude that both Rev1 and Polz are
required for the efficient bypass of abasic sites in
yeast.
INTRODUCTION
An apurinic/apyrimidinic site (2-deoxyribose, AP) is one of
the most frequently encountered DNA lesions in cells (1–3).
Significant amounts of AP sites are spontaneously generated
via hydrolytic depurination (4), and increased generation of
AP sites occurs when cells are exposed to oxidative stress or to
genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation (4,5). Furthermore,
AP sites are normal intermediates of base excision repair
initiated by the glycosylases that respond to insults inflicted
upon DNA by a wide variety of damaging agents (6,7). In
addition to the AP sites, oxidized abasic lesions are also pro-
duced when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation or other
sources of oxidative stress that generate significant amounts of
reactive oxygen species (5,8). 2-Deoxyribonolactone (L) and
the C4-oxidized 4-hydroxy-2-deoxyribose (C4-AP) are two of
the more commonly observed oxidized abasic lesions (5,8).
Recent studies suggest that these lesions are produced in sig-
nificant amounts under certain conditions (9–12). Oxidized AP
sites are also generated by various antitumor agents (13–15).
For example, exposing DNA to the neocarzinostatin chro-
mophore can lead to the generation of L sites (13,14) and
interaction of DNA with bleomycin produces a significant
amount of C4-AP sites (15,16).
In in vitro experiments, abasic lesions (AP, L and C4-AP)
are processed efficiently by purified AP endonucleases, such
as bacterial endonuclease IV and exonuclease III (6,7,17–19),
which nick the DNA 50 to the lesion. In contrast, the processing
efficiency of these abasic sites by the DNA lyase activities
associated with many DNA glycosylases is quite variable
(17,18,20–22). Escherichia coli DNA glycosylases such as
endonuclease III, endonuclease VIII and formamidopyrimi-
dine N-glycosylase as well as yeast endonuclease III homologs
(Ntg1 and Ntg2) and oxoguanine N-glycosylase recognize an
AP site efficiently and nick the DNA 30 to the lesion (6). While
E.coli endonuclease III also recognizes C4-AP, it cleaves
DNA containing the lesion 100-fold less efficiently than
does endonuclease IV or exonuclease III (17). Exposing
endonuclease III to DNA containing L actually leads to the
formation of an irreversible crosslinked complex (20,21).
In addition to in vitro biochemical analyses, the biologi-
cal processing and consequences of AP sites have been well

documented in E.coli, where these sites are both cytotoxic and
mutagenic (1,4,6,7). Relatively little is known about the
biological processing of oxidized AP sites. Early data indi-
cated that these sites are also highly mutagenic and cytotoxic
(23–26) and these earlier observations have been supported by
more recent studies in E.coli (27–29). In E.coli, replication of
an M13 single-stranded plasmid containing either AP, L or C4-
AP sites requires the lesion bypass polymerases pol II, pol IV
and pol V(27–29). These lesion bypass polymerases interact
distinctly with each type of abasic lesion, generating a unique
mutation spectrum for each. 20-Deoxyadenosine (20-dA), for
example, is preferentially incorporated opposite an AP site,
while dG is incorporated as well or better than dA opposite L
(27,29,30). In addition, single nucleotide deletions are pro-
duced opposite AP and L sites in a sequence-dependent man-
ner that involves a misinsertion–misalignment process (29). In
contrast, a large proportion of the C4-AP bypass events results
in 3 nt deletions (28).
In yeast, the biological processing of defined AP sites has
been examined using plasmid gap-filling assays (31,32),
assays that require the conversion of a single-stranded plasmid
to a duplex form (33) or transformation assays that target
a lesion-containing oligonucleotide to a defined genomic
region (34). In contrast to the ‘A-rule’ of AP bypass in
E.coli, dC was incorporated preferentially opposite the AP
site in each of the yeast assays. Genetically, AP bypass in
yeast clearly requires the participation of the Polz (a complex
of the Rev3 and Rev7 proteins) and Rev1 polymerases, but
Polh (encoded by RAD30) has been implicated in the insertion
of dCMP opposite an AP site under some circumstances (33).
Although there is no information regarding the processing of
oxidized AP sites in yeast, these sites are likely recognized by
the yeast AP endonucleases and lyases in a similar manner as
in E.coli. In the event that these oxidized lesions escape the
action of Apn1, the major AP endonuclease in yeast, oxidized
abasic sites are expected to block replicative DNA poly-
merases, and lesion bypass in the form of translesion synthesis
or a template switching event would be needed for the cell to
survive.
In the current study, we investigate the bypass and associ-
ated mutagenicity of 2-deoxyribonolactone, an oxidized AP
site in yeast using single-strand oligonucleotide-mediated
transformation, and directly compare its bypass with that of
the natural AP site or the AP site analog, tetrahydrofuran (F).
The genomic lys2DA746 1 frameshift allele was used as the
target for 30 nt oligomers (30mer) containing an extra nucle-
otide or defined abasic site located precisely at the position of
the frameshift mutation. Integration of the oligonucleotide and
subsequent bypass of the abasic site during DNA replication
results in the addition of a nucleotide, thereby reverting the
lys2DA746 frameshift allele and restoring a selectable Lys+
phenotype. Relative to an undamaged control 30mer, the
frequency of Lys+ transformants obtained with a lesion-
containing 30mer reflects the efficiency of lesion bypass. In
addition to assessing bypass in wild-type strains, the contri-
butions of the Rev1, Polz and Polh to the bypass of the dif-
ferent types of abasic sites were examined using appropriate
mutant strains. Finally, the sequencing of individual
Lys+ transformants from each background allowed the speci-
ficity of lesion bypass by the various TLS polymerases to be
determined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotide LysA30, which contain sequences that flank
the lys2DA746 allele, and LysA30R, which has the same
sequence of LysA30 but is of reversed polarity, were obtained
from Qiagen. Oligonucleotides containing a unique tetrahy-
drofuran (LysA30-F) or uracil (LysA30-U) were also obtained
from Qiagen. To obtain an oligonucleotide containing a 2-
deoxyribose (LysA30-AP), LysA30-U was treated with an
excess amount of uracil DNA glycosylase as described pre-
viously (35). LysA30-L contained a 2-deoxyribonolactone (L)
and was prepared by UV irradiation (350 nm) of parental
oligonucleotide containing the appropriate photochemical pre-
cursors (36,37). Figure 1 shows the structures of these various
abasic sites. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for
yeast transformations and the lys2DA746 target site are listed
in Table 1.

transforming cells with BamHI/EcoRI-digested pSCP19A,
which contains the apn1D::HIS3 allele (39). Deletions of
the complete open reading frames of RAD30, REV1 or
REV3 were obtained following transformation with an appro-
priate PCR fragment and selection for geneticin-resistant
transformants (40). PCR fragments were derived using
genomic DNA from the appropriate null strain (OPEN
BIOSYSTEMS) as template.
Single-strand oligonucleotide-mediated
yeast transformations
Yeast transformations were performed by electroporation as
described by Otsuka et al. (34) with the following modifica-
tions. To prepare competent cells, 25 ml of an overnight
culture were inoculated into 900 ml of YEPD medium
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.0075% L-adenine hemi-
sulfate and 2% glucose) and grown at 30C with shaking
to an OD600nm of 1.3–1.5. Cells were collected by centrifuga-
tion at 4C (GSA rotor, 6000 r.p.m. for 30 min), and follow-
ing two washes with sterile cold H2O and one wash with cold
1 M sorbitol, were resuspended in 900 ml of sterile 1 M sorbitol
and maintained at 4C. In a typical experiment, 300 pmol of
an oligonucleotide were mixed with 300 ml of the competent
cell suspension and the mixture was kept on ice for 5 min prior
to transfer to an electroporation cuvette (2 mm gap, 400 ml
capacity). Electroporation was performed by applying a
1.5 kV, 186 W pulse (Electro Cell Manipulator Electropora-
tion System, BTX), and the electroporated cells were imme-
diately diluted with 900 ml of YEPD medium. Cells were
allowed to recover on a rocker at 30C for 15 min and then
were spread onto two lysine-deficient selection plates (38).
Lys+ transformants were counted following the incubation
of plates at 30C for 3–5 days. To determine the background
reversion of the lys2DA746 allele, control oligonucleotide
LysA30R, which has the same sequence as the LysA30
but with reverse polarity, was used for yeast transformation.
In those cases where the background reversion frequency
was close to the measured transformation frequency, the
bypass efficiency was calculated using the fraction of
sequenced Lys+ colonies with an insertion precisely at the
position of the abasic site in the transforming 30mer. Because
such ‘true’ reversion events have not been found among the
several thousand lys2DA746 revertants sequenced in other
studies (38,41), they are considered to reflect bona fide bypass
events.
DNA sequence analysis
Yeast genomic DNA was extracted from the Lys+ transfor-
mants using standard yeast protocols (40). A region of the
LYS2 gene spanning the sequence of the transforming oligonu-
cleotide was PCR amplified using primers MO18 and
Lys1359R as described by Harfe and Jinks-Robertson (38).
The PCR products were sequenced using a commercial service
(Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea). Only transformants that
acquired an insertion of a nucleotide at exactly the position
of the nucleotide deleted in the lys2DA746 allele were com-
piled to generate the mutation spectrum associated with the
bypass of each of the abasic sites.
RESULTS
Correction efficiency of the lys2DA746 allele using
single-stranded oligonucleotides
The efficiency of allele correction in yeast following trans-
formation with short single-stranded oligonucleotides is
dependent on both the length and concentration of the oligonu-
cleotide (42,43). To determine the background reversion and
transformation efficiencies at the LYS2 locus, wild-type (WT)
and apn1D strains containing the lys2DA746 allele (deletion
of an adenine from the coding strand) were transformed with
the 30 nt oligomers LysA30R and LysA30 (see Table 1 for
sequences and Table 2 for yeast strains used in this study).
LysA30 has the same sequence and polarity as the LYS2 cod-
ing strand and contains the nucleotide that is deleted in the
lys2DA746 allele. Its incorporation into genomic DNA restores
a Lys+ phenotype. The LysA30R 30mer has the same sequence
but reverse polarity as LysA30. Any transformants obtained
using this oligonucleotide reflect non-specific background.
When 300 pmol of the oligonucleotides were used, the number
of revertants obtained with LysA30R was <1% of the number
obtained with LysA30 (Table 3). It should be noted that the
frequency of revertants obtained after electroporation with
LysA30R was no different from the background reversion
frequency, indicating that the process of transformation is
not mutagenic in this assay. In addition, the presence/absence
of Apn1 did not affect the transformation efficiency of the
undamaged LysA30 oligonucleotide. These results are similar
to those obtained using the cyc1-31 frameshift allele as a target
in oligonucleotide-mediated transformation (34,42,43) and
establish the suitability of the lys2DA746 allele for examining
the bypass of various AP sites in yeast.
A distinct advantage of using the lys2DA746 rather than
the cyc1-31 allele in this type of analysis is that the position
of the transforming oligonucleotide need not be constrained to
the precise position or immediate vicinity of the frameshift
mutation to be corrected. As shown in other studies with this
allele, a compensatory +1 frameshift can occur anywhere
within an 150 bp ‘reversion window’ defined by stop codons
in alternative reading frames (38,41). Although not exploited
in the current studies, this feature of the lys2DA746 system will
allow a detailed examination of sequence context effects on
lesion bypass during the replication of chromosomal DNA.
Finally, selection with the LYS2-based system is very clean.
There is little, if any, background growth of mutants on the
selective medium, and extragenic suppression has never been
observed.
Bypass efficiencies of defined abasic sites
Previous oligonucleotide-mediated transformation experi-
ments with the cyc1-31 allele (34) demonstrated that AP
sites are bypassed at similar frequencies in WT and apn1
strains (7.2 and 8.6%, respectively). In contrast, the bypass

frequency of F increased over 10-fold in an apn1 mutant
relative to a WT strain in these studies (6.2 and 0.33%, respec-
tively). Preliminary experiments with the lys2DA746 allele as
a target for an AP- or F-containing 30mer (LysA30-AP or
LysA30-F, respectively) indicated that the efficiency of trans-
formation with either oligonucleotide was at or below the
background obtained with LysA30R control 30mer, suggest-
ing that both lesions were efficiently repaired in this system
(data not shown). Because the predominant repair of these
lesions is expected to occur through the action of the Apn1
AP endonuclease (44), all subsequent experiments were
conducted in an apn1D background.
In contrast to previous observations with the cyc1-31 allele
where F and AP bypass occurred at comparable frequencies
[8%; (34)], F was bypassed in the lys2DA746 system almost
10-fold more efficiently than an AP site in an apn1 mutant
(31.8 and 3.4%, respectively; Table 4). It is interesting to note
that the oxidized L lesion was also efficiently bypassed
(23.4%). We considered the possibility that the inefficient
bypass of the AP relative to the L and F lesions in the
apn1 mutant might reflect repair by enzymes other than
Apn1. In addition to Apn1, it is known that an AP site can
be recognized by the minor AP endonuclease, Apn2 (45), as
well as by the yeast homologs of E.coli endonuclease III,
Ntg1 and Ntg2 (46). The number of transformants obtained
with LysA30-AP was similar, however, for the apn1 single,
the apn1 apn2 double and the apn1 ntg1 ntg2 triple
mutants (data not shown). These data suggest that the signi-
ficantly lower transformation efficiencies exhibited by
oligonucleotides containing AP is not a repair-related issue,
but rather reflects simply inefficient bypass in this particular
context.
The bypass frequency of F did not decrease significantly in
the apn1 rad30 mutant, but there was a significant, 65% reduc-
tion in the apn1 rev1 and apn1 rev3 mutants (Table 4). Bypass
of the oxidized L occurred in a qualitatively similar manner. It
was unaffected by loss of Polh (apn1 rad30 mutant), but was
reduced >85% in the apn1 rev1 and apn1 rev3 mutants. In spite
of the low transformation efficiencies with 30mer containing
the AP lesion, a similar trend was evident. The bypass effici-
ency of the AP site did not decrease significantly in the apn1
rad30 double mutant, but there was a significant, 62 and 50%
reduction in the apn1 rev3 and apn1 rev1 mutants, respectively
(Table 4). These data suggest that Polz (Rev3) and Rev1 are
important for the bypass of normal and oxidized AP sites, as
well as the AP site analog F. In contrast, Polh (Rad30) plays
only a minor, if any, role in the bypass of these lesions.
Mutagenic specificity of defined abasic sites
Using a short oligonucleotide that targets the cyc1-31 allele,
Otsuka et al. (34) found that dC was the most frequent nuc-
leotide incorporated opposite an AP site, whereas dA was
slightly favored over dC for incorporation opposite F (34).
Although the primary goal in our studies was to determine
the frequencies with which each nucleotide is incorporated
opposite the oxidized L, we also examined insertion specifici-
ties during the bypass of AP and F lesions. It should be noted
that only those Lys+ transformants containing an insertion at
the position of the abasic site in the transforming oligonu-
cleotide were included in these analyses. As mentioned pre-
viously, no ‘true’ reversions of the lys2DA746 allele have ever
been observed spontaneously, so any mutations that precisely
restore the deleted nucleotide must reflect translesion synthesis
past the corresponding abasic site. The nucleotide insertion
distribution for each strain/lesion was based on the sequences
of 20–30 bypass events.
With all three lesions, the majority of the insertion events
were dC or dA, with an insertion of dG or dT being observed
only sporadically (Table 5). As expected based on earlier
studies, dC was preferentially incorporated opposite an AP
site (68%), followed by dA (32%) in an apn1 mutant
(Table 5). Although a similar insertion bias for dC opposite
the AP site was observed in the apn1 rad30 mutant, dA was
preferentially incorporated in the apn1 rev1 and apn1 rev3
mutants, (64 and 82%, respectively). In contrast to the clear
bias for dC insertion during AP bypass in the apn1 mutant, dA
and dC were incorporated opposite F and L sites at roughly
comparable levels (40–50% for each; Table 5). As for the AP
lesion, loss of Polh (apn1 rad30 mutant) had little effect on the

nucleotide insertion preference opposite the F and L lesion.
However, loss of Rev1 or Rev3 resulted in a much higher
dA:dC insertion ratio opposite the F and L lesions (Table 5).
Taken together, these results indicate that dA and dC are the
preferred nucleotides for insertion opposite a variety of abasic
sites and provide further support for preferential insertion of
dC by the combined action of Rev1 and Polz.
DISCUSSION
The biological processing of AP sites is well documented in
both yeast and E.coli (1,4,6,7,39,44). In E.coli, dA is most
frequently incorporated opposite an AP site (the ‘A’ rule)
whereas in yeast, dC is clearly preferred in most assays
(the ‘C’ rule) (1,4,32). The one reported exception to the
C-rule (47) has been explained in alternative ways (31,33)
and is unlikely to violate the rule for AP site bypass in
yeast. In agreement with the mutation specificity of AP
sites in bacteria, polymerases Pol I, II and IV preferentially
incorporate dA opposite an AP site (27–29). Yeast contains
three TLS polymerases that could be important in bypassing
AP sites: Rev1, Polz (Rev3–Rev7 complex) and Polh (Rad30).
Consistent with the C-rule, Rev1 has been shown to have
deoxycytidyl transferase activity (48). In vitro, Rev1 inserts
dCMP opposite an AP site, and the terminal dCMP can then be
extended by Polz (49).
Using a short lesion-containing oligonucleotide to introduce
an AP site into the yeast CYC1 locus, Otsuka et al. (34) showed
that this lesion was bypassed in a manner dependent on Rev1
(an involvement of Polz was not examined) but not on Rad30
(34). As expected, dC was preferentially inserted opposite the
lesion, and recent data have confirmed that the catalytic activ-
ity of Rev1 is indeed required for this bypass (48). In the
current study, we have also used oligonucleotide-mediated
transformation to demonstrate that AP sites are similarly
bypassed at low frequency when introduced at the LYS2
locus, that dC is the preferred base inserted opposite the
AP site and that the bypass is dependent on both Rev1 and
Polz (Rev3). In addition, our data are consistent with only a
minor role for Rad30 in the bypass of genomic AP sites. While
these transformation data are consistent with those obtained
when examining AP bypass within a gapped plasmid (31,32),
it has been reported that all three yeast TLS polymerases are
involved in the bypass of an AP site engineered into a com-
pletely single-strand plasmid (33). One possible explanation
for these conflicting results is that the local sequences that
flank the AP site influence the polymerase specificity. Because
there is a general agreement between the lys2DA746 and cyc1-
31 genomic bypass studies and the gap-filling assay, all of
which involve different sequence contexts, it is unlikely
that sequence context is the determining parameter. A second
possible explanation is that the major difference resides in the
use of a completely single-stranded plasmid as opposed to
duplex (or partially duplex) DNA as the template for in
vivo bypass. With regard to the oligonucleotide-mediated
transformation studies reported here and elsewhere, lesion
bypass occurs in the context of chromosomal DNA so that
the lesion is expected to interact with the full repertoire of
replication complexes. We suggest that the accessory proteins
within the replication complex stalled at an AP site interact
much more favorably with Rev1 and Rev3 than with Rad30.
This notion is supported by our observations that the ability
to bypass F and L were also predominantly dependent upon
Rev1 and Rev3 and only marginally on Rad30 (Table 4).
Despite the fact that F is only recognized by AP endonu-
cleases and is not processed by AP lyases in vitro (50), the
tetrahydrofuran analog has been used as a model AP site for
examining the mechanism of lesion bypass in E.coli and yeast
(27,29,34). With respect to lethality, mutagenicity and inter-
actions with lesion bypass polymerases, F appears to be a good
model for an AP site in SOS-induced E.coli cells, although it
should be noted that dC instead of dA was preferentially
incorporated opposite F (27,29). In uninduced E.coli cells,
nucleotide insertion specificity was similar for both AP
sites and F, but the polymerases involved differed. Pol II
and pol IV played major roles in the bypass of AP sites,
whereas F bypass required the participation of pol V (29).
In yeast, the biological responses toward F and AP sites are
clearly different. Despite the observation that AP and F were
bypassed at similar frequencies at the CYC1 locus in an apn1
mutant, dC was preferentially inserted opposite an AP site,
whereas dA was inserted at a much higher frequency than dC
opposite F (34). In our experiments targeting the lys2DA746
allele, Apn1-defective yeast bypassed F almost 10-fold more
efficiently than an AP site. Relative to the bypass observed
with the cyc1-31 allele (34), F was bypassed 4-fold more
frequently in the lys2DA746 assay, and the AP site 2-fold
less frequently. In agreement with the cyc1-31 data, there
was a striking bias for dC to be inserted opposite an AP
site during correction of the lys2DA746 allele, but dA and
dC were inserted at equal frequencies opposite F (Table 5).
These data clearly demonstrate that F is a poor model for an
AP site with respect to both bypass efficiency and mutagenic
specificity in yeast.
Recent reports have provided significant information
regarding enzyme recognition, lethality and mutagenicity of
the oxidized L lesions in E.coli. Using a plasmid replication
assay, bypass of L requires the participation of the lesion
bypass polymerases pol II, pol IV and pol V (27–29). Both
AP sites and oxidized abasic sites are 100% lethal in E.coli
lacking all three lesion bypass polymerases (27). In the current
study, we demonstrated that, like AP sites, the bypass of L
requires Rev1 and Polz, and that its bypass is mutagenic. It
is interesting to note that an L lesion was bypassed 10-fold
more efficiently than AP lesions in apn1 and apn1 rad30
mutants. These data suggest that if apn1 cells are exposed
to ionizing radiation or stress conditions that generate signifi-
cant amount of reactive oxygen species, a significant percent-
age of the induced mutations could potentially be the result
of bypass at an L rather than at an AP site. The ability of yeast
to bypass L clearly required the participation of Rev1 and
Rev3, but not Rad30. In summary, the experiments reported
here provide additional support for the C-rule of AP bypass in
yeast and indicate that tetrahydrofuran (F) is not an appropriate
substitute for examining the efficiency and specificity of AP
bypass in vivo. In addition, these experiments reveal both
similarities between the bypass of AP and oxidized abasic
sites in terms of the TLS polymerases required, but differences
in terms of nucleotide insertion preference. Under conditions
where significant amount of L lesions are produced, L may
contribute significantly to the overall mutagenesis induced by
abasic sites. Finally, it should be noted that the development
6200 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 19
of the lys2DA746 allele as a target for introducing lesion-
containing oligonucleotides into a chromosomal context
for subsequent bypass will allow a detailed analysis of the
influence of flanking sequences on bypass efficiency and
specificity.
