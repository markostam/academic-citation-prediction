[1] An Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) was deployed at the Pittsburgh
Environmental Protection Agency Supersite from 7 to 22 September 2002 as part of the
Pittsburgh Air Quality Study (PAQS). The main objectives of this deployment were to
characterize the concentrations, size distributions, and temporal variations of nonrefractory
(NR) chemical species in submicron particles (approximately PM1) and to further develop
and evaluate the AMS. Reasonably good agreement was observed on particle
concentrations, composition, and size distributions between the AMS data and
measurements from collocated instruments (given the difference between the PM1 and
PM2.5 size cuts), including TEOM, semicontinuous sulfate, 2-hour- and 24-hour-averaged
organic carbon, SMPS, 4-hour-averaged ammonium, and micro-orifice uniform deposit
impactor. Total NR-PM1 mass concentration in Pittsburgh accumulates over periods of
several days punctuated with rapid cleaning due to rain or air mass changes. Sulfate and
organics are the major NR-PM1 components while the concentrations of nitrate and
chloride are generally low. Significant amounts of ammonium, which most of the time are
consistent with sulfate present as ammonium sulfate, are also present in particles.
However, there are periods when the aerosols are relatively acidic and more than 50% of
sulfate is estimated to be in the form of ammonium bisulfate. No major enhancement of
the organic concentration is observed during these acidic periods, which suggests that
acid-catalyzed SOA formation was not an important process during this study. Size
distributions of particulate sulfate, ammonium, organics, and nitrate vary on timescales of
hours to days, showing unimodal, bimodal and even trimodal characteristics. The
accumulation mode (peaking around 350–600 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter for
the mass distributions) and the ultrafine mode (<100 nm) are observed most frequently.
The accumulation mode is dominated by sulfate that appears to be internally mixed with
oxidized organics, while combustion-emitted organics are often the main component of
the ultrafine particles (except during nucleation events). The ultrafine-mode organic
aerosols are mainly associated with combustion sources (likely traffic).

1. Introduction
[2] Atmospheric aerosols have important adverse impacts
on human health [Dockery et al., 1993; Pope et al.,
2002], visibility [Watson, 2002], and ecological integrity
[Bytnerowicz and Fenn, 1996; Paerl et al., 1997; Schindler,
1988]. Aerosols also play important roles in atmospheric
processes that are intrinsically linked to climate change
[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
2001] and stratospheric ozone depletion [Solomon, 1999].
While a thorough understanding of particle concentration,
size distribution, chemical composition, state of mixing, and
morphology is essential to address the radiative, ecological
and human health effects of atmospheric particles, our
knowledge of these parameters is usually limited by the

coarse time and size resolution of most existing instrumen-
tation for aerosol chemical measurements [McMurry, 2000].
[3] Several instruments that are capable of performing
real-time and continuous (or semicontinuous) size-resolved
measurement of ambient aerosol composition have been
developed in the last decade [Jayne et al., 2000; Murphy et
al., 1998; Suess and Prather, 1999]. Compared to the
traditional multistage impactor technologies, online tech-
niques are usually faster, less labor intensive, and less
vulnerable to artifacts introduced during sample collection
and processing. While most recently developed size-
resolved composition instruments measure the qualitative
composition of single particles [Middlebrook et al., 2003],
the Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) can
determine the sizes and chemical composition of the
ensemble of submicron particles in situ, with time resolu-
tion of minutes for typical ambient measurements [Jayne et
al., 2000; Jimenez et al., 2003c]. The AMS has been
successfully employed in more than 30 field campaigns
and laboratory studies to characterize the properties, iden-
tify the possible sources and elucidate the dynamics of
ambient and laboratory aerosols [e.g., Alfarra et al., 2004;
Allan et al., 2003a; Bahreini et al., 2003; Canagaratna et
al., 2004; Drewnick et al., 2004b; Jimenez et al., 2003b,
2003c; Morris et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2004].
[4] We deployed an AMS in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
during September 2002, as part of the Pittsburgh Air
Quality Study (PAQS). PAQS was sponsored by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to address the relation-
ship between particulate matter (PM) and health effects,
establish the PM source-receptor relationships, and develop
and evaluate the next generation of PM monitoring tech-
niques [Wittig et al., 2004]. The focus of this AMS
deployment was to characterize the chemistry and dynamics
of ambient aerosols with high time and size resolution and
therefore offer insights into the sources and processes of
particles in the Pittsburgh region. In this paper, we mainly
report the size-resolved chemical composition, concentra-
tions, and temporal variations of the nonrefractory particle
components (i.e., sulfate, organics, ammonium and nitrate).
Quality control measures, such as corrections for nonideal-
ity of the AMS measurements and comparisons between the
AMS results and various collocated measurements, are also
reported. The chemistry and growth mechanisms of ultra-
fine particles during nucleation events in Pittsburgh [Zhang
et al., 2004] and a more detailed organic analysis (Q. Zhang
et al., Deconvolution and quantification of primary and
oxygenated organic aerosols based on aerosol mass spec-
trometry: Part 1. Development and validation of the meth-
od, submitted to Environmental Science and Technology,
2004) (hereinafter referred to as Zhang et al., submitted
manuscript, 2004) are discussed in separate papers.
2. Experimental Methods
2.1. Sampling Site and Time
[5] The AMS was operated at the PAQS central site
(40270N, 79570W) continuously, except for occasional
maintenance and calibration, from 7 to 22 September
2002. This site was located 6 km east of downtown
Pittsburgh, on a hill of Schenley Park next to Carnegie
Mellon University [Wittig et al., 2004]. Baseline monitoring
for PM, gas-phase and meteorological variables lasted for
15 months at this site from July 2001 to October 2002
[Wittig et al., 2004]. An overview of PAQS and the Super-
site operation was given by Wittig et al. [2004]. Other
details can be found in the PAQS Quality Assurance Project
Plan prepared by Khlystov et al. [2001].
[6] All dates and times are reported in Eastern Standard
Time (EST). The local time during this study was Eastern
Daylight Saving Time (EDT), which is 1 hour ahead of
EST.
2.2. AMS Instrument and Its Operation
2.2.1. Description of the AMS
[7] The AMS has been described in detail in other
publications [Alfarra et al., 2004; Allan et al., 2003b; Jayne
et al., 2000; Jimenez et al., 2003c]; thus only a brief
overview is given here. The AMS consists of three major
parts: a particle beam generation inlet system, an aerody-
namic sizing chamber, and a particle composition detection
section. The inlet system contains a 100 mm critical orifice
that sets the airflow into the AMS at a nominal rate of
1.4 cm3 s1 and an aerodynamic lens system that
focuses particles into a narrow beam of about 100 mm
in diameter [Heberlein et al., 2001].
[8] Particles acquire size-dependent velocities upon su-
personic expansion into the high-vacuum sizing chamber,
where their vacuum aerodynamic diameters (Dva) are deter-
mined on the basis of calibration using particles of known
sizes, densities, and shapes, such as polystyrene latex (PSL)
spheres. Details on Dva (effectively the aerodynamic diam-
eter measured in the free-molecular regime) and its relation-
ships with mobility diameter (Dm) and the traditional
aerodynamic diameter (measured in the continuum regime)
are given by Canagaratna et al. [2004], Jimenez et al.
[2003a, 2003b], and DeCarlo et al. [2004].
[9] In the composition detection section, particles are flash
vaporized upon impact with a heated surface (600C
during this study) under high vacuum (108 torr). The
resulting vapor molecules are ionized by electron impact and
the positive ions formed are analyzed by a quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Balzers QMA410, Balzers, Liechtenstein).
Because of the use of thermal vaporization, only non-
refractory (NR) particle components, such as SO4
2, NO3
,
NH4
+ and organics, are determined. ‘‘Nonrefractory’’ is
defined operationally as those species that evaporate on
timescales of a few seconds (i.e., one period of the
blocked/open alternation of the particle beam chopper
during the MS mode operation) or less under the AMS
conditions. Minerals and elemental carbon are undetectable
because of their very low vapor pressure at 600C. In
addition, since the AMS used in this study has an
approximate 1 mm transmission size cut, the results of its
measurements are referred to as NR-PM1.
[10] The AMS alternates between the particle time of
flight (P-TOF) mode and the mass spectrum (MS) mode
during operation [Jimenez et al., 2003c]. A set of prese-
lected m/z is scanned as a function of particle’s time of flight
in the P-TOF mode, from which the ensemble size distri-
butions of aerosol species are derived. Mass loadings are
calculated from the ensemble background-subtracted mass
spectra (m/z 1–300) acquired during the MS mode opera-
tion using a software package developed by Allan et al.

[2004b]. Interferences for the mass concentration and size
distribution data are checked according to procedures
described by Jimenez et al. [2003c] using a data diagnostics
module (AMS Diagnostics 1.1.7a) developed by A. Delia
(CU).
[11] Note that the AMS used here is not a single particle
technique because the quadrupole MS measures only one
m/z at any one time, instead of the complete mass
spectrum of individual particles. Reported AMS mass
spectra and size distributions are the averages over spec-
ified intervals (5–10 min for this study; see section 2.2.2).
2.2.2. Operation of the AMS
[12] The AMS, along with a number of other PAQS
sampling instruments, was housed in a 33 m2 trailer during
this study [Wittig et al., 2004]. Ambient air was drawn into
the AMS through a thermally insulated copper tube (5 m
long and 0.95 cm ID) from 2 m above the trailer rooftop.
Coarse particles were removed using a cyclone with a
2.5 mm cutoff (model URG-2000-30EN, URG, Chapel Hill,
North Carolina). The total flow through the copper tube
was 10 L min1, out of which 0.1 L min1 was isokineti-
cally sampled from the center of the tube by the AMS and
the rest was exhausted by the sampling pump. The resi-
dence time of sample air in the tube was 7 s.
[13] The AMS alternated between the P-TOF and MS
modes every 25 s. During the P-TOF mode operation
signals of twelve m/z that are representative for NO3
 (m/z
30 and 46), SO4
2 (m/z 48 and 64), organics (m/z 43, 44, 55,
and 57), NH4
+ (m/z 15 and 16), H2O (m/z 18), and N2 (m/z
28) were recorded as a function of particle’s time of flight.
Four additional (mostly) organic fragments (m/z 27, 67, 91,
and 95) were scanned after 8:55 pm on 13 September.
Reported mass concentrations and size distributions are
the averages over periods of 10 min before 9:50 am on
12 September and 5 min afterward.
2.2.3. Instrument Calibrations
[14] The AMS was calibrated several times for electron
multiplier (EM) gain, ionization and ion transmission and
detection efficiency (IE), and particle sizing during this
study (Figure 1). The electron multiplier was calibrated
every 1–2 days to compensate for the normal reduction in
sensitivity over time and to restore optimum ion signals. IE,
which is defined as the ratio of ions detected by the
multiplier to the number of the parent molecules vaporized
in the AMS, was calibrated with monodisperse pure am-
monium nitrate particles generated from an aqueous solu-
tion by a Collison atomizer (TSI model 3076, St. Paul,
Minnesota) and a differential mobility analyzer custom built
by Aerodyne Research (using the TSI DMA, model 3081).
Monodisperse polystyrene latex spheres (PSL; Duke Scien-
tific, Palo Alto, California) with nominal sizes of 50, 81,
155, 350, 600, and 700 nm and density of 1.054 g cm3
were used to calibrate the AMS sizing. Detailed quantifi-
cation protocols are described in previous publications
[Alfarra et al., 2004; Allan et al., 2003b; Jayne et al.,
2000; Jimenez et al., 2003c].
2.3. Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC)
2.3.1. AMS Detection Efficiency
[15] In order to minimize uncertainties in the reported
mass concentrations it is desirable that the fluctuations of
the detection efficiency of the AMS are closely monitored
and properly corrected throughout the whole campaign. The
parameters that capture the AMS detection efficiency are
IENO3, which is the ionization efficiency of a reference
compound (NO3
), and the air beam signal (AB), which is
the ion rate (Hz) detected for the direct beam of a major air
component, e.g., N2
+ [Allan et al., 2003b; Jimenez et al.,
2003c]. While AB can be monitored continuously during
instrument operation, the determination of IENO3 requires
interruption of sampling to perform a calibration experiment
(typically 1–2 hours). Given this restriction and the expec-
tation (based on previous experience) that variations in IE
can be corrected by changes in air beam signal (i.e., the ratio
of IE to air beam signal was usually relatively stable)
three IENO3 calibrations were conducted during this study
(Figure 1). The measured IENO3 values increase by 50%
between the first two calibrations but are constant between
the second and the third, suggesting an improvement in
the general detection efficiency of the AMS during the
first few days of operation. This initial increase in
detection efficiency has very often been observed after
initial pump-down of the AMS and is possibly due to an
enhancement in the detection efficiency (ratio of output
signal pulses to ions impacting the first dynode surface) of
the electron multiplier detector after its surfaces degas.
Because the ratios of IENO3 to AB remain remarkably
constant during this study (r.s.d. < 1%) the continuous AB
signal can be used to correct for the variations in the
AMS detection efficiencies to a very good approximation.
2.3.2. AMS Collection Efficiency (CE) and Relative
Ionization Efficiency (RIE)
[16] CE is introduced to correct for incomplete detection
of NR-PM1 by the AMS [Alfarra et al., 2004], e.g., due to
the fact that a fraction of irregularly shaped particles may
not reach the AMS vaporizer [Jayne et al., 2000; Tobias et
al., 2000] or due to particle bounce from less-volatile
particles (T. Onasch, Aerodyne Research, personal commu-
nication, 2004). Note that CE accounts only for the fraction
of PM1 that may not be detected by the AMS, and is not
intended to account for the difference in size cutoffs
between the AMS (approximately PM1) and PM2.5 instru-
ments. The AMS reports PM1 concentrations and we have
made no attempt to predict PM2.5 concentrations on the
basis of our PM1 measurement. Although strictly speaking

voltage and air beam signal (N2
+) measured immediately

CE should be a function of particle size, composition, and
shape, at present it is defined as the correction factor for the
bulk mass concentrations, i.e., the fraction of the particle
mass that is measured by the AMS, relative to what would
have been measured if all particles were spherical and
particle bounce was negligible. In addition, while the
component of the AMS collection efficiency due to losses
of nonspherical particles can now be measured in real time
using a particle beam width probe (BWP) system (J. A.
Huffman et al., manuscript in preparation, 2004) this device
was not available at the time of this study. We therefore
chose CE values on the basis of the general characteristics
of the Pittsburgh aerosols and previous experience from
multiple field campaigns and laboratory experiments.
[17] A CE value of 0.5 is assigned to sulfate (Table 1), on
the basis of observations from several laboratory and field
tests for sulfate aerosols [Alfarra et al., 2004; Allan et al.,
2004a, 2003b; Drewnick et al., 2004a]. The same CE value
(i.e., 0.5) is applied to nitrate and ammonium, because they
appear to be internally mixed with sulfate in particles for
most of the time in Pittsburgh.
[18] The CE value for total NR-PM1 organics is estimated
on the basis of their size distributions, which often show
two modes: a larger accumulation mode that appears to be
internally mixed with SO4
2, NO3
 and NH4
+, and a smaller
mode that seems to be mainly emitted from combustion
sources (see section 3.2.2). A CE value of 0.5 is thus
applied to the accumulation mode organics (due to the
likely internal mixing with SO4
2) while CE for the smaller
mode is assumed to be 1.0 because a recent laboratory study
has shown close to 100% AMS transmission and detection
for sooty combustion particles [Slowik et al., 2004]. By
studying the size distributions of total organics, as well as
individual organic m/z, averaged over the whole sampling
period we found that these two modes can be best separated
at Dva = 160 nm and that the mass ratio of the smaller (Dva <
160 nm) to the larger mode (Dva > 160 nm) is roughly 2/3.
The CE value of the bulk organics is therefore set at 0.7
(Table 1).
[19] Relative ionization efficiency (RIE) is the ratio of the
electron impact ionization efficiency of a given species to
IENO3 on a per unit mass basis. RIE values of individual
species (Table 1) are determined following the approach
described by Jimenez et al. [2003c] and Alfarra et al.
[2004].
[20] Although CE and RIE for organic aerosols in this
study are likely to be size dependent, at this point we have
chosen to apply constant values (i.e., CE = 0.7 and RIE =
1.4) throughout the whole size range and time period of this
study. Going beyond this simple approach requires a tech-
nique that can separate the contributions of the various
organic aerosol types, and thus allow the application of
separate values of CE and RIE to each type. One such
technique has recently been developed by our group and is
presented in a separate publication (Zhang et al., submitted
manuscript, 2004). The direct quantification of the compo-
nent of CE due to particle shape using the AMS BWP
described above (J. A. Huffman et al., manuscript in
preparation, 2004), and the use of particle humidification
and/or the redesign of the AMS vaporizer to reduce particle
bounce will further reduce the uncertainties in mass quan-
tification for future studies.
[21] An important consequence of applying constant CE
and RIE is that the proportion of the small mode and
accumulation mode in the reported organic size distribution
is likely distorted. First, the CE of the accumulation mode
organic aerosols is likely smaller than 0.7 while that of the
ultrafine mode is likely larger. Also because the average
RIE of combustion-emitted organic species is larger than
that of oxygenated organics [Jimenez et al., 2003c], RIE of
accumulation mode organics is expected to be smaller than
1.4 while that of the ultrafine mode is larger. Thus the small
mode, mainly primary organics are likely overestimated,
while the accumulation mode, mostly oxygenated organics
are likely underestimated.
2.3.3. Detection Limits of the AMS Measurements
[22] The detection limits (DL) of the AMS measurements
of mass concentration are evaluated on the basis of the mass
spectra of particle free ambient air (filtered with a HEPA
filter). The species DLs are defined as 3 times the standard
deviation of the corresponding species signals in the filtered
air. The DLs of SO4
2, NH4
+, NO3
, and organics during this
study are estimated to be 0.05, 0.11, 0.01, and 0.15 mg m3,
respectively, for a 10 min averaging time (Table 2). Note
that these values are 2–3 times higher (i.e., worse) than the
3s instrumental detection limits defined by Allan et al.
[2004a, 2004b, 2003b], but 1–2 orders of magnitude lower
(i.e., better) than those of the ACE-Asia campaign [Bahreini
et al., 2003]. The major reason for the 3s instrumental DLs
estimated by Allan et al. [2004a, 2003b] to be smaller is that
they only take into account uncertainties due to electronic
noise and the ion counting statistics of the background
[Allan et al., 2003a, 2003b]. The substantially lower sensi-
tivity of the AMS during the ACE-Asia study was attributed
to a relatively high level of background signals in the AMS
due to a less optimized vacuum system and inability to

3.1. Intercomparisons With Collocated Instruments
[23] Figure 2 shows the time series of the concentrations
of particle mass (approximately NR-PM1), organics, sulfate,
and ammonium reported by the AMS, together with com-
parable traces from collocated instruments, including PM2.5
mass measured by a tapered element oscillating microbal-
ance (TEOM, Rupprecht & Patashnick Co., Inc, model
1400A, Albany, New York) that sampled at 30C and was
equipped with a Nafion diffusion dryer sample equilibration
system (SES), along with a PM2.5 inlet, apparent particle
volume (calculated assuming spherical particles) measured
by a scanning mobility particle sizer system (models
3936N25 and 3936L10, TSI, Inc.), 2-hour PM2.5 OC
measured in situ using a Sunset Laboratories thermal optical
transmittance carbon analyzer [Turpin et al., 1990] and
24-hour OC from manual undenuded filter samples
(sampling details given by Subramanian et al. [2004]),

PM2.5 sulfate measured with a semicontinuous sulfate
analyzer (Rupprecht and Patashnick, model 8400S) similar
to the nitrate instrument described by Stolzenburg and
Hering [2003] and Wittig et al. [2004], and semicontinuous
PM2.5 NH4
+ measured using a steam sampler [Khlystov et al.,
1995]. Note that PM2.5 is defined on the basis of aerody-
namic diameter measured at atmospheric pressure, which to
first approximation equals the ratio of Dva to the square root
of particle density for spherical particles. Overall the agree-
ment of these comparisons is fairly good given the differ-
ences in size cutoff (Figure 2) and the correlation coefficients
(r2) are in the range of 0.64–0.88 (Figure 3).
[24] On the basis of the linear regression slopes, on
average, the AMS reports 66% of the total PM2.5 mass
observed by the TEOM and 75% of the PM2.5 sulfate
from the semicontinuous SO4
2 analyzer (Figure 3). These
differences likely reflect the fact that the AMS measures
PM1 rather than PM2.5 and that it has no response to
refractory species, such as crustal, soot and metal compo-
nents. Drewnick et al. [2004b] observed a similar regression
slope (0.64) between the AMS and PM2.5 TEOM data at
Queens, New York, during the summer of 2001.
[25] Compared to those reported during two other field
studies, the correlation coefficients (r2) of particle mass and
sulfate data measured by the AMS compared to those by
TEOM and sulfate analyzer observed during this study
(0.71 and 0.68, respectively) lie somewhat in the middle.
During the PMTACS-NY summer 2001 campaign in
Queens/New York, Drewnick et al. [2004a] reported very
high r2 (0.9) between AMS-SO42 and three semicontin-
uous PM2.5 sulfate instruments, including particle into
liquid sampler (PILS), R&P sulfate monitor (R&P 8400S),
and a custom built continuous sulfate monitor. Allan et al.
[2004a], however, observed a lower r2 (0.56) between
SO4
2 data from the AMS and those from the PILS during the
ITCT 2K2 study at Trinidad Head, California. Similarly, the
correlation between AMS-measured PM1 mass concentra-
tions and TEOM PM2.5 mass was also significantly better
during the PMTACS-NY study (r2 = 0.91) [Drewnick et al.,
2004b] than during this study (r2 = 0.71). It is not yet clear
the exact reason for these differences, but more variable
amounts of material between PM1 and PM2.5 in Pittsburgh
as compared to New York might have played a role.
[26] Good correlation is observed between the AMS
organic mass concentrations and 2-hour-averaged organic
carbon concentrations measured by the Sunset Labs in situ
carbon analyzer (r2 = 0.88; Figure 3). This observation
implies that the nominal particulate organic mass to carbon
ratios (i.e., OM:OC ratios) are mostly in the range 1.2 to
2.2, with a regression slope of 1.7 (larger if differences in
size cutoff, i.e., PM1 versus PM2.5, are accounted for). This
value is similar to the OM:OC ratio (1.6 ± 0.2) recently
estimated for urban organic aerosols [Turpin and Lim,
2001]. Although the actual values are expected to change
with time because of their dependence on organic aerosol
types (the values are likely smaller in the morning when
significant amounts of fresh combustion organic aerosols
(OM:OC ratio  1.2) are emitted and larger (e.g., OM:OC
ratio  2.0) in the afternoon when organics are more
oxidized and secondary in nature [Russell, 2003; Turpin
and Lim, 2001]), we did not observe significant diurnal
variations in OM:OC ratios. One possible explanation for
this is that ambient PM1 organics in Pittsburgh is often
dominated by regional aged particles [Anderson et al., 2004;
Tang et al., 2004], and thus show less pronounced differ-
ence in OM:OC ratios between morning and afternoon.
Cabada et al. [2002], for instance, estimated that up to 50%
of the organic aerosol mass in Pittsburgh is of secondary
origin during the summer. Our AMS mass spectra also
suggest that there was a relatively high concentration of
oxygenated organic aerosols during most periods in this
study (Zhang et al., submitted manuscript, 2004).
[27] Present analytical uncertainties of the AMS might
have also contributed to the lack of significant differences in
the ratios of the AMS organic mass to the organic carbon
content, between periods that appeared to be dominated by
different types of organic aerosols. The AMS organic data
may suffer from compensating systematic biases due to the
application of constant relative ionization efficiency (RIE)
and collection efficiency (CE; see section 2.3.2) for organic
signals. According to Jimenez et al. [2003c] the expected
RIE of oxygenated organics is somewhat lower than that of
the hydrocarbons. However, we have used the average of
these two types of organic aerosols (i.e., RIE = 1.4;
Table 1), which probably has led to an overestimation of
the mass concentrations of primary organic aerosols and an
underestimation of those of the secondary. Similarly, using a
constant CE, which can be different for different organic
aerosol types, might have introduced analytical errors as
well. A procedure of separating the contributions of primary
and oxidized organics aerosols (using both the size distri-
butions and the mass spectra from the AMS) is currently
under development and will be presented in a future
publication (Zhang et al., submitted manuscript, 2004). This
technique will permit the application of different RIE and
CE factors to primary and oxidized aerosols, which may
increase the variability of the OM:OC ratios.
[28] Given that the AMS and the SMPS during this study
appear to measure a relatively similar particle population
(detailed in paragraphs below and in Figure 4), the regres-
sion slope of the AMS mass concentrations and the SMPS
volume concentration provides an estimation for the density
of bulk particles in Pittsburgh, i.e., 1.4 g cm3. However,
as shown in Figure 3, the correlations between these two
measurements appear to separate into two groups. The
likely reasons for the separation are the effects of particle
shape (see Figure 4a and associated discussions) and
density. Further work in our group is in progress to address
this apparent discrepancy by quantitative simultaneous
modeling of the AMS and SMPS data [DeCarlo et al.,
2004; Slowik et al., 2004].
[29] We estimated that the typical dry density of the
nonrefractory PM1 in Pittsburgh is roughly 1.55 g cm
3
on the basis of the average particle composition of 65%
inorganics (i.e., SO4
2, NH4
+, and NO3
) and 30% organics
(see section 3.2), plus 5% of black carbon, and the assump-
tion that the densities of (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3, bulk organ-
ics, and black carbon are 1.78, 1.72, 1.2 g cm3 [Turpin
and Lim, 2001], and 1.77 g cm3 [Park et al., 2004]
respectively. Black carbon was estimated from AMS m/z
57 during the periods in which it was not available since
these measurements were strongly correlated (r2 = 0.78;
slope = 0.11 mg m3/mgC m3) (Zhang et al., submitted
manuscript, 2004). Note that the estimated densities

reported in this study may contain systematic errors because
refractory species other than black carbon, such as metals
and crustal components, are not detectable by the AMS.
However, refractory species other than black carbon on
average only contribute <10% of the total mass of PM1 in
Pittsburgh [Cabada et al., 2004]. Thus the error in the
estimated density due to the omission of metals and crustal
components is expected to be small. Wittig et al. [2004]
reported a similar value, 1.5 g cm3, for the bulk density of
the ambient particles in Pittsburgh, on the basis of TEOM
and SMPS measurements.

sentative periods. The AMS data are the sum of SO4

, and organics. The distributions of SMPS mass con-
centrations (M) were calculated from the number distribu-
tion data [Jimenez et al., 2003a, 2003b]:
M ¼ p=6 D3m  rest ð1Þ
Dva  Dm  rest ð2Þ
where Dm is the mobility diameter reported by the SMPS
and rest is the estimated density of nonrefractory particles
weighted by AMS-measured particle composition assuming
an average density of 1.77 g cm3 for inorganic species and
1.2 g cm3 for organics [Turpin and Lim, 2001].
[31] In order to examine the influence of black carbon on
estimated particle density, we have estimated the size
distributions of elemental carbon (EC) during this study.
Our approach is based on the findings that an AMS mass
spectral signature, m/z 57, is a good tracer for primary
combustion related organic aerosols [Alfarra et al., 2004;
Zhang et al., submitted manuscript, 2004]. Good correlation
has been observed between the mass concentrations of m/z
57 and those of EC (r2 = 0.78; slope = 0.11 mg m3/mgC
m3) during this study (Zhang et al., submitted manuscript,
2004). While some dependence of the density, and thus OC/
EC ratio, of diesel soot particles versus mobility diameter
has been shown [Park et al., 2004], this dependence is
significantly reduced when considered versus Dva [Slowik et
al., 2004]. Thus we estimated the size distribution of
elemental carbon (in Dva space) to be the same as that of
m/z 57. We subsequently calculated the estimated density
of particles including the EC contribution assuming an EC
density of 1.77 g cm3 [Park et al., 2004] and along with
information about the inorganic and organic components.
The effect of EC in the estimated density is very small for
the accumulation mode, but is more important for smaller
particles and for periods where combustion emission con-
centrations are larger (e.g., Figure 4a).
[32] The average mass distributions obtained by the AMS
and the SMPS agree quite well for 2 periods (Figures 4b and
4c), but at 2:00–4:00 am, 12 September, the AMS reported
significantly larger mass of small particles (Dva < 120 nm)
and significantly lower mass of accumulation mode par-
ticles (Dva  200–700 nm) than the SMPS did (Figure 4a).
Such discrepancy has been frequently observed in urban
areas when comparing the AMS and SMPS data, and is
attributed to the presence of a significant amount of small
irregularly shaped particles (e.g., soot from traffic emis-
sions). This is because the AMS and the SMPS respond
differently to particle shape: as a particle becomes less
spherical, the AMS-measured Dva decreases while the
SMPS-measured Dm increases [Jimenez et al., 2003a,
2003b; DeCarlo et al., 2004]. This effect also leads to an
overestimation of the accumulation mode by the SMPS, due
to irregular particles that appear larger than they really are
(and thus have much more apparent than real volume).
Indeed, we found that the ultrafine particles during 2–4 am
on 12 September were almost pure organic (average esti-
mated density including EC contributions, i.e., rest
w/EC,
1.4 g cm3) while those from the other two periods
contained significantly more inorganics (resulting in higher
rest
w/oEC; Figure 4a).
[33] In general, these two instruments agree well on the
size distributions of the accumulation mode particles for
periods b and c, although the AMS reports slightly lower

carbon size distribution was estimated (see text), rest

estimated only using the AMS inorganic and organic data (i.e., not including the contributions of black
carbon), is shown as a comparison.

mass concentrations than the SMPS does at these sizes.
Besides the possible influence from particle shape, another
reason for such discrepancy is that the AMS does not
measure refractory components, such as the mineral and
crustal materials. It is interesting to note the comparatively
good agreement between the SMPS and AMS on the
distributions of the ultrafine particles during 3–5 pm,
12 September (Figure 4b). The reason is that a major
fraction of these particles were the product of extensive
condensational growth of the new particles that formed in a
regional intense nucleation event that happened in the
morning of 12 September [Zhang et al., 2004]. These
particles appeared to be relatively spherical and as such
the AMS and the SMPS detect them similarly.
[34] We also compared the average size-resolved chemical
composition data determined by the AMS in this study
(September 2002) to those obtained with a micro-orifice
uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) for July 2001 (Figure 5).
The results from the two instruments are similar at Dva
below 0.8 mm, despite the different sampling time peri-
ods. This is not surprising since the general characteristics
of the particles during these two long averaging periods are
expected to be similar given the major regional contribu-
tions to fine particle concentrations in Pittsburgh, the likely
similar local emission mix, and the similar season of
sampling (July versus September) [Anderson et al., 2004;
Tang et al., 2004; Wittig et al., 2004]. In addition, in order
to better compare the AMS and MOUDI mass distributions,
we plotted the MOUDI data onto Dva space using the
following simplified equation [Canagaratna et al., 2004;
Jimenez et al., 2003a, 2003b]:
Dva  Da  r1=2est ð3Þ
where Da is the aerodynamic diameter measured by
MOUDI and rest is the estimated density of particles
(Figure 5). In this way, the average mass distribution of
Pittsburgh particles in July 2001 appears to peak at Dva of
0.8–1 mm. The differences between the AMS and
MOUDI at Dva > 600 nm might be due to less than unit
transmission of the AMS for particles larger than 600 nm
(i.e., the approximately PM1 cut of the AMS versus the
PM2.5 cut of the MOUDI). This comparison is consistent
with the differences between the concentrations of particle
mass and sulfate measured by the AMS and TEOM and the
sulfate analyzer (Figures 2 and 3) are partly due to the
difference size cuts of the instruments (i.e., PM1 versus
PM2.5), although it is not a proof due to the different
sampling periods. Similar findings have been reported by
Alfarra et al. [2004].
[35] Note that a mass closure test, i.e., a thorough
evaluation of the differences between the mass concentra-
tions measured by the AMS and those of the TEOM would
be very valuable. However, it is not possible to perform
such a test for this data set since MOUDI data, as well as
data for some refractory components such as minerals and
metals, are not available for this period.
3.2. Particle Characteristics and Dynamics
3.2.1. Mass Concentrations
[36] The temporal variations of the mass concentrations
of NR-PM1 SO4
2, NH4
+, NO3
, organics, Cl, and total
(= SO4
2 + NH4
+ + NO3
 + organics + Cl) are shown in
Figure 6. Sulfate (for 70% of the time during this study),
and less frequently organics (for 30%), dominates the
particle composition. The mass concentrations of ammo-
nium are relatively high as well, and are well correlated
with those of sulfate (r2 = 0.83; Figure S1 in the auxiliary
material1). These two species together account for more
than half of the total NR-PM1 mass for over 75% of the
sampling time of this study.
[37] The correlation between the mass concentrations of
organics and sulfate is relatively weak (r2 = 0.41; Figure S1
in the auxiliary material). Our interpretation for this obser-
vation is that local traffic emissions contribute significantly
to the organic particle concentrations while the ambient
concentrations of particulate sulfate are likely mainly driven
by regional accumulation rather than local emissions. How-
ever, these two species appear to be internally mixed in the
accumulation mode, as suggested by the good correlation
between the mass concentrations of organics and sulfate in
Figure 5. Comparisons of size-resolved chemical compo-
sitions measured by the AMS during September 2002 to
those of a MOUDI during July 2001. Note that ‘‘Da’’ is the

the 250–1000 nm size range (see section 3.3.2.). Indeed,
internally mixed organics and sulfate in Pittsburgh fine
particles have been observed by Bein et al. [2005] using a
rapid single-particle mass spectrometer (RSMS). In addi-
tion, similar findings have been reported in studies at other
locations using single-particle MS techniques, such as
particle analysis by laser mass spectrometry (PALMS)
[Lee et al., 2003, and references therein].
[38] Nitrate and chloride are generally low and both show
very weak correlations with sulfate (r2 < 0.1). The mass
concentrations of NO3
 are likely controlled by partitioning
or formation of nitric acid. Since NaCl is not measured by
the AMS at the vaporizer temperature used in this study the
detected chloride must originate either from more volatile
inorganic chlorides (such as NH4Cl) or from organic chlo-
rine-containing species. We observed some correlation (r2 
0.30, Figure S1 in the auxiliary material) between NO3
 and
Cl, probably due to the fact that the formation of NH4NO3
and NH4Cl is favored by the same conditions: higher NH3
in the gas-phase and higher RH.
[39] Multiday episodes of fine particle pollution, with
intermittent cleaner periods, are observed (Figure 6). The
cleaner periods often start with heavy rainfall (e.g., 5 pm
on 14 September and 6 am on 21 September) and/or
the arrival of clean air from Canada (e.g., 1–4 am on
11 September), which quickly reduce the mass concentra-
tions of NR-PM1 by one to two orders of magnitude.
Afterward, the particle mass loading gradually increases
but remains low for 1–3 days. Most significant and lasting
increases of aerosol mass concentrations are associated with
rapid increases of sulfate. Several short-lived spikes of
organic aerosols are detected, likely due to the passage of
relatively fresh local plumes by the sampling site. The mass
spectra and size distributions of these organic aerosols
suggest that they originated from combustion sources.
3.2.2. Size Distributions
[40] Figure 7 shows the average size distributions and
chemical compositions of NR-PM1 during 4 periods
(marked as I, II, III, and IV on Figure 6) of this study.
These periods were selected to represent various aerosol
‘‘climatologies’’ observed in this study: Period I is relatively
polluted with approximately equal amounts of sulfate and
organic aerosols; II corresponds to the growth stage of a
strong regional nucleation event [see Zhang et al., 2004]; III
is a relatively clean period after a rain shower; and IV is a
sulfate-dominated regional pollution episode.
[41] The mass distributions are significantly different
during these 4 periods, showing unimodal, bimodal and
even trimodal characteristics. An accumulation mode peak-
ing between 350–600 nm (Dva) is constantly observed. This
mode appears to be an internal mixture of ammonium
sulfate with variable amounts of organics and a minor
fraction of nitrate. In general, as the aerosol mass concen-
tration increases and for more aged particles (e.g., in period
IV), the peak diameter of the accumulation mode increases,
the distribution appears to be narrower (e.g., the geometric
standard deviations sg of total mass distributions were 2.0
and 1.6 for periods III and IV, respectively), and the sulfate
content increases (Figure 7). However, the size distributions
reported here are ‘‘as measured’’ and could be skewed by
the limited aerodynamic lens transmissions for particles
larger than 600 nm and smaller than 60 nm in Dva [Jayne
et al., 2000]. Details in evolution of the mass distributions
of particle species during this entire study are presented in
Figures S4 and S5 in the auxiliary material.
[42] In addition to the accumulation mode, two smaller
modes, one below 100 nm and one at 200 nm, are also
frequently observed (e.g., Figure 7, periods I and II). Given
the essentially same size distributions of NH4
+ and SO4
2
throughout the entire campaign, and the good correlations
between their mass concentrations (see section 3.2.1), these
two species appear to be internally mixed, likely in the
forms of (NH4)2SO4 and NH4HSO4, in all modes. The
organics, however, very often show an ultrafine mode
(Dva < 100 nm) that seems to be externally mixed with
the other species. We have evidence that fuel combustion,

i.e., traffic emissions (see section 3.3.2) is a major source of
these small mode organic aerosols. Similar findings have
been reported for AMS measurements in other urban areas
[e.g., Alfarra et al., 2004; Boudries et al., 2004; Drewnick et
al., 2004c]. Canagaratna et al. [2004] also reported a peak
Dva of 90 nm on the mass-weighted size distributions of
the fresh diesel exhaust particles.
[43] Ultrafine particles behave rather differently during
period II, the particle growth stage of a strong regional
nucleation event that started at 8:00 am. These particles
consist of comparable amounts of sulfate and organics,
which appear to be an internal mixture, together with
NH4
+ and NO3
 (Figure 7, period II). In fact, given the
similarities in their size distributions, SO4
2, NH4
+, NO3
, and
organics appear to be internally mixed over the entire size
range during period II. Such homogeneity in aerosol com-
position was developed through extensive condensation of
gas phase species including H2SO4, NH3, HNO3, and
photochemically processed organic species, a phenomenon
that is commonly observed during the growth stage of
nucleation events in Pittsburgh. The reader is referred to
Zhang et al. [2004] for a detailed description on the
evolution of particle compositions and size distributions
during this nucleation event.
[44] The average size distribution of particle mass con-
centration of the entire sampling period demonstrates a
broad peak at 550 nm (Dva), a slight shoulder at around
200 nm, and a tail that extends below 100 nm (Figure 8a).
The composition of the particles changes as a function of
size in that larger particles tend to contain more SO4
2 and
NH4
+ and less organics (Figure 8b). As a result, the
estimated particle density is strongly size dependent as
well, with higher values for the larger particles (Figure 8c).
Note that mineral species have not been taken into account
since they are not detectable by the AMS and their size-
resolved measurements were not available during this study.
As described above, this omission should only cause a small
error in the estimated density.
[45] Sulfate is the major component of the accumulation
mode while organics dominate the mass of particles smaller
than 200 nm (Dva). Despite the high frequency of nucleation
events in Pittsburgh [Stanier et al., 2004] and the fact that
the ultrafine particles produced during the nucleation events
are mainly composed of SO4
2 and NH4
+ [Zhang et al.,
2004], organics overall account for up to 80–90% of the
ultrafine mass (Dva < 100 nm) (Figure 8b). This observation
is consistent with combustion emissions being the major
source of ultrafine mass in Pittsburgh, since the nonrefrac-
tory fraction of ultrafine particles from combustion pro-
cesses are usually almost completely organic [Canagaratna
et al., 2004]. A detailed analysis on the possible sources of
organic species in Pittsburgh will be presented in a future
publication (Zhang et al., submitted manuscript, 2004).
[46] In addition to the accumulation mode and the ultra-
fine mode particles, there also appears to be an intermediate
mode (Dva  100–250 nm) that is composed of comparable
amounts of SO4
2 and organics. The size ranges of these
particles correspond to the so-called condensation mode
[Pandis et al., 1995] and are likely the condensational
growth products of the ultrafine particles from primary
emissions or formed during the nucleation events. Concep-
tually these particles may be ‘‘on their way’’ to the accu-
mulation mode, but not yet had enough time, or had not
been through cloud or fog processes [Pandis et al., 1995], to
grow to that size yet. These AMS-measured mass distribu-
tions are consistent with measurements by MOUDI at the
same site during the summer of 2001 [Cabada et al., 2004].
3.2.3. Diurnal Variations of Mass Concentrations
and Size Distributions
[47] A summary of the diurnal cycles of SO4
2, NH4
+,
NO3
, and organics is shown in Figure 9. Note that the dips
at the eighteenth hour on the plots are biased by a very large

positions of particle species during four time periods with

and sharp drop in particle concentration between 17:00 and
18:00 on 15 September, due to heavy rainfall (see Figure 6).
The mass concentration of sulfate does not show a pro-
nounced diurnal cycle, but nonetheless demonstrates a
slight increase during the day (Figure 9a). Such increase
appears to be driven by enhanced photochemical production
of gaseous H2SO4. However, the overall lack of a clear
diurnal cycle of sulfate suggests that multiday accumulation
of sulfate on a regional scale dominates over its same-day
photochemical production. The average concentrations of
ammonium also slightly increased during the afternoon
(Figure 9b), probably a result of neutralization of the
enhanced H2SO4 uptake.
[48] Themass concentration of nitrate shows a pronounced
diurnal profile that peaks in the early morning, drops after
10 am, and stays at low levels between 12:00 noon and
7:00 pm (Figure 9c). The observed cycle is likely partially
driven by the gas-to-particle partitioning of ammonium
nitrate precursors (gaseous HNO3 and NH3), which is
favored by the lower temperature and higher relative
humidity during the night and the early morning [Seinfeld
and Pandis, 1998]. In addition, the higher level of night-
time gaseous N2O5 and NO3, which are quickly photolyzed
during the day, might have acted as a significant source of
NO3
 concentrations at night [Brown et al., 2003a, 2003b;
Pandis et al., 1995] while enhanced higher particle acidity
in the afternoon, as suggested by a relatively steeper
increase of SO4
2 than NH4
+ between 1:00 pm and 4:00 pm
(Figures 9a and 9b), might have played a role in reducing
the concentration of NO3
 in the particles during that
period.
[49] The average mass concentrations of organics are
somewhat higher at night (Figure 9d), which might be
attributed to the lower mixing layer depth that traps the
city emissions. In addition, a small peak of organic mass
is observed during the morning rush hour between 7:00–
9:00, reflecting the fact that traffic emissions are usually
an important source of organic aerosols in urban areas.
Drewnick et al. [2004b] reported similar diurnal behaviors
of SO4
2, NO3
, and organics at Queens, New York, during
July 2001.
[50] Figures 9e–9h are the average size distributions of
the species during two time periods of the day, 6–9 am EST
(i.e., 7–10 am EDT; the morning rush hours) and 1–4 pm
(i.e., the period of most intense photochemistry and accu-
mulation of photochemically produced aerosols). The aver-
age size distributions of SO4
2, NH4
+, and NO3
 are similar to
each other in the morning (6–9 am) as well as in the
afternoon (1–4 pm). A much broader distribution of the
organics, however, is observed during the morning rush
hour, indicating the presence of large amounts of traffic-
related small mode organic aerosols.
[51] The average size distribution of organics is much
narrower during 1–4 pm and becomes very much alike to
those of the inorganic species (Figure 9h). It appears that the
organic aerosols from morning traffic emissions have been
diluted by the increase of the mixing layer height and
evolved by coagulation and/or condensation of gas phase
species.
3.2.4. Particle Acidity
[52] We evaluated the acidity of the particles by compar-
ing measured NH4
+ mass concentration to the amount
needed to fully neutralize the measured SO4
2, NO3
 and
Cl. Particles are considered ‘‘more acidic’’ if the measured
NH4
+ concentration is significantly (by 25% or more) lower
than the predicted values, and as bulk neutralized if the two
values are similar. A measured-to-predicted NH4
+ ratio of
0.75 suggests that roughly 50% of the SO4
2 molecules in
the particles are in the form of bisulfate (HSO4
). This
approach should be relatively accurate because Pittsburgh
particles generally contain very low amounts of the metal
ions, such as Na+, Ca2+ and K+ [Rees et al., 2004; Wittig et
al., 2004].
[53] On the basis of this definition, aerosols appear to be
bulk neutralized to slightly acidic for the majority of the
time, but there are also episodes when they are ‘‘more
acidic’’ (Figure 10). We estimate that for roughly 20% of
the time during this study the measured-to-predicted NH4
+
ratios are less than 0.75, i.e., the mole ratio of NH4HSO4 to
(NH4)2SO4 is above 1 (Figure 10b). Because the acidic
particles are often found during the high-mass-loading
periods and only show a weak correlation with UV 
SO2, which is a proxy for gas-phase H2SO4 production

rate, we speculate that they are particles transported from
large plumes relatively depleted of NH3.
[54] Summarized in Figure 11 are the average compo-
sitions of neutralized (i.e., measured-to-predicted NH4
+
ratio  1.0) and ‘‘more acidic’’ (i.e., measured-to-predicted
NH4
+ ratio < 0.75) particles. Compared to those considered as
neutralized, the ‘‘more acidic’’ particles on average contain
30% more mass, which is almost exclusively due to the
increase of SO4
2. These two types of particles, however,
contain comparable amounts of organics and NH4
+. Within
the limitations of this analysis, we observe negligible en-
hancement on the organic concentration that could be
attributed to acid-catalyzed secondary organic aerosol for-
mation [Jang et al., 2002]. In addition, the concentrations of
NO3
 and Cl in the ‘‘more acidic’’ particles are roughly half
of those in the neutralized particles, probably because of
displacement of HCl and HNO3 by H2SO4 in the competi-
tion for NH3 [West et al., 1999].
3.3. Primary and Secondary Aerosol Sources and
Processes
3.3.1. Gas to Particle Partitioning of Nitrate
[55] In order to investigate the diurnal cycles of the
particulate nitrate mass, we plotted in Figure 12 the average
diurnal patterns of NO3
 together with UV  NO2, which is
a proxy for daytime HNO3 production rate, and the equi-
librium formation constant of NH4NO3 from gas phase
HNO3 and NH3 (i.e., Kp, ppb
2). The Kp defined here is
the inverse of the product of the partial pressures of NH3
and HNO3, and thus it is calculated using the inverse form
of equation 9.91 of Seinfeld and Pandis [1998]:
lnKp ¼ 1= 84:6 24220=T  6:1 ln T=298ð Þð Þ
where T is the ambient temperature in Kelvin. Although this
equation only applies to dry particles, the relative trend of
partitioning versus temperature is exactly the same when
particles contain liquid water (equation 9.92 of Seinfeld and
Pandis [1998]).
[56] The diurnal profile of the CO concentrations is also
included as a first-order indicator for daily changes in the
boundary layer height. Overall, the diurnal patterns of NO3
,
Kp and CO positively correlate, but all anticorrelate with
that of UV  NO2 (Figure 12). Although the morning peaks
of NO3
, CO, and Kp are shifted by about 1–2 hours, these
comparisons nonetheless suggest that variations in the

+ versus predicted NH4

of measured to predicted NH4
+ during the entire study (7–22 September 2002 EST). Note that predicted
NH4
+ concentrations were calculated from measured SO4
2, NO3
, and Cl assuming full neutralization of
these anions by NH4
+.
Figure 11. Average compositions of neutralized and
‘‘more acidic’’ NR-PM1 particles during 7–22 September
2002. The neutralized particles are defined as those with
measured-to-predicted ratio of NH4
+ between 0.93 (the
mean value) and 1.15 (90th percentile), and the ‘‘more
acidic’’ particles are those with a ratio of less than 0.75, i.e.,
those that contain approximately equal moles of NH4HSO4
and (NH4)2SO4.

mixing layer depth and gas to particle partitioning of HNO3
appear to have played important roles in driving the diurnal
cycles of the particulate NO3
 concentrations. On the other
hand, the fact that the NO3
 concentrations remain high for
2 hours after 7:00 am, when in general Kp starts to
decline and boundary layer height begins to increase,
suggests that either photochemical production of HNO3 or
transport of nitrate particles are responsible for maintaining
the NO3
 level during this period of time. Despite the
relatively higher photochemical production of HNO3 in
the afternoon, this mechanism does not result in increased
NO3
 concentrations during that time period.
3.3.2. Combustion Sources and Photochemical
Formation of Organic Aerosols
[57] In addition to the average size distributions (see
section 3.2.3), the average mass spectra of organic aerosols
are also considerably different between the morning rush
hours (i.e., 6–9 am EST or 7–10 am local time) and the
afternoon (1–4 pm; Figure 13). The mass spectrum of the
morning organic aerosols shows prominent peaks at m/z 55
(C4H7
+ and C3H3O
+) and 57 (C4H9
+), which are generally
associated with primary (combustion-emitted) organics
from combustion sources [Alfarra et al., 2004; Canagaratna
et al., 2004], while that of the afternoon organic aerosols is
dominated by m/z 44 (CO2
+), which is a pronounced peak
in the AMS mass spectra of oxygenated organics [Alfarra
et al., 2004; Drewnick et al., 2004b]. Note that m/z 43
(C3H7
+ and C2H3O
+) is a major peak in both mass spectra,
because it is produced in roughly equal fractions from
primary and secondary/oxidized organic aerosols and
therefore is more of a surrogate for the bulk organics. In
addition, mass fragments that are representative for com-
bustion source organic species, such as m/z 69, 71, 85, 91
and 95 [McLafferty and Turecek, 1993], are all compara-
tively higher in the mass spectrum of the morning organics
(Figure 13). Overall these mass spectra are consistent with
morning organic aerosols having a higher contribution of
traffic-related combustion source emissions while the
afternoon aerosols appear to be more oxidized.
[58] A study with two AMSs at 3 sites in the Vancouver
area in Canada reported much more marked differences
between the mass spectra of urban and rural organic
aerosols [Alfarra et al., 2004] than between the morning
and afternoon spectra in this study. The reason for the
relatively smaller difference in the mass spectra in this
study is that primary aerosols always contribute to the
observed concentrations in Pittsburgh, while their contribu-
tion is very small for the rural aerosol in Vancouver. In
addition, relatively high background of oxidized organic
aerosols has been observed in both studies most of the time.
[59] Since aged organic species more likely reside in the
accumulation mode, we compared the diurnal profiles of
small mode (Dva = 30–100 nm) and accumulation mode
(Dva = 250–1000 nm) organics (Figure 14). The mass
concentrations of the ultrafine mode are elevated in the
morning and evening rush hours and are much lower in
the afternoon when photochemistry is usually intense. The
accumulation mode on the other hand, did not show much
of a diurnal variation. The average mass loading of the
accumulation mode organic aerosols increased slightly
between 1 pm and 4 pm, suggesting the formation of
secondary organic aerosols. We observed a comparatively
good correlation between the accumulation mode organics
and sulfate (r2 = 0.73; Figure 15), which is an indication
that these two species are likely internally mixed in the
accumulation mode particles. The slope of the regression

line likely represents the ratio of the source strengths of
both aerosol types in the region.
4. Conclusions
[60] Nonrefractory submicron particles (NR-PM1) were
measured in Pittsburgh from 7 to 22 September 2002 using
an Aerodyne AMS. Reasonably good agreement was ob-
served between the AMS and collocated instruments on
total and species mass concentrations, and on size distribu-
tions, with smaller AMS concentrations likely due to the
difference between PM1 and PM2.5. The comparisons of
the size distributions obtained by the AMS and the SPMS,
and the AMS composition data suggest that the average
density of particles in Pittsburgh during this period was
1.5 g cm3.
[61] Submicron particles in Pittsburgh during this time
period were generally characterized by high contents of
SO4
2 and organics, and low levels of NO3
 and Cl. The
mass balance between NH4
+ and the anions suggest that
the majority of the particles are neutralized to slightly
acidic. However, during relatively polluted periods signif-
icantly acidic particles (i.e., those estimated to contain
approximately equal or larger amounts of NH4HSO4 than
(NH4)2SO4) are observed. Compared to neutralized par-
ticles, acidic particles generally contain significantly more
sulfate, comparable amounts of organics and NH4
+, and
less NO3
 and Cl. We see no evidence of enhanced
secondary organic aerosol formation due to acid-catalyzed
organic chemistry.
[62] We observed a quickly changing aerosol popula-
tion due to the combined influences from transport, local
emissions, gas-to-particle conversion, and photochemistry.
Through this entire study, the mass concentration of NR-
PM1 varies from below 1 mg m
3 to as high as 70 mg
m3, with an average value of 15 mg m3 and a

standard deviation of 9 mg m3. The mass concentrations
and size distributions of particulate species vary on
timescales between less than an hour to 2 days. On
the basis of the size distributions and diurnal profiles of
the particle species, in addition to the mass spectra of the
organic aerosols, we found that the NR-PM1 particles in
Pittsburgh are composed of 3 major modes, an ultrafine
mode that is mainly composed of traffic organics, a
relatively aged mode that likely grew by gaseous con-
densation, and an accumulation mode that is dominated
by sulfate and ammonium.
Appendix A: Removal of Gaseous Interference
From the Size Distribution of Ammonium
[63] The NH4
+ size distribution was derived from the
signal distribution of m/z 16 (NH2
+) in the P-TOF range
corresponding to the sizes of the particles transmitted into
the AMS. However, the O+ (also m/z 16) signal from the
ionization of gas phase O2 tails into the particle region,
interfering with the measurement of NH4
+ in small particles
for Dva < 100 nm (Figure A1). The tail of the O2 signal,
which is attributed to a spread in the velocities of O2
molecules after the focusing lens, can be modeled using
an exponential fit that has the same functional form as the
one-dimensional Boltzmann velocity distribution function
[Atkins, 1998; Morris, 2002],
s ¼ a exp  v bð Þ
2
c
 !
ðA1Þ
where s is the ion rate (Hz) detected for the signal, a, b, and
c are fit parameters, and v is the velocity of the species
measured in the P-TOF sizing chamber.
[64] Because the same function should apply to all
gaseous species, N2 and O2 alike, we estimated the a,
b, and c values by fitting the signal distribution of m/z 28
(N2
+) to equation (A1), for P-TOFs corresponding to 1–
200 nm in Dva (Figure A1a). m/z 28 was chosen because
among all m/z it has the highest signal-to-noise ratio and is
the least affected by particle signals. Using the fitted a, b,
and c values, the gas phase signals of m/z 16 were then
calculated and subtracted from the 1–200 nm region to give
‘‘filtered’’ NH4
+ distributions (Figure A1a). All reported size
distributions of NH4
+ were corrected with this method. It
needs to be noted that this correction is negligible for
particles larger than Dva of 70 nm (Figure A1b), but is
critical for a quantitative examination of the chemistry of
new particles during the nucleation events [Zhang et al.,
2004].
[65] The same technique is generally applicable to
removal of gas signals from the size distributions of
particle species, such as m/z 28 (CO+) and m/z 44
(CO2
+) for organics and 18 (H2O
+) for water. At ambient
conditions, except for m/z 28, whose size distribution in
the particle range is hugely influenced by gaseous N2,
other m/z generally chosen in P-TOF mode contain
negligible amounts of gas signals compared to the particle
signals because the aerodynamic lens and skimmers of

the AMS reduce the concentration of gas phase species
by a factor of 107 relative to aerosol species [Allan et al.,
2004b].
Appendix B: Adjustment of the NH4
+ Size
Distributions for Faster Ion Flight in the
Quadrupole
[66] We observed a small (approximately 60 ms) shift in
time of flight between the distributions of ammonium and
sulfate throughout this campaign. The shift arises partly
because the NH2
+ ion (m/z 16) travels slightly faster within
the quadrupole than the SO+ and SO2
+ ions (m/z 48 and 64)
do. This is expected since all singly charged ions have the
same kinetic energy of about 14 eV in the quadrupole (as
used in AMS instruments), and thus the dwelling times of
ions in the quadrupole are proportional to the square root of
the mass to charge ratio of the ions. To adjust for this mass-
dependent ion transition time in the quadrupole we mea-
sured the apparent P-TOF for various PSL ions originated
from the same monodisperse particles. This experiment
shows that the average difference between the P-TOFs of
SO4
2 ions and that of NH4
+ was indeed 60 ms (Figure B1).
Because no obvious shifts in P-TOF were observed between
internally mixed SO4
2 and NO3
 or organics we adjusted the
size distributions of NH4
+ by increasing its time of flight by
60 ms.
[67] As shown in Figure B1b, the relationship between
Dva and P-TOF is nonlinear: a 60 ms difference in P-TOF
translates into 10–15% difference in Dva in particles
smaller than 70 nm but only 4–5% for the accumulation
mode particles. As such, this is most important for the
small size NH4
+, which is only significant during the
new particle formation and growth events [Zhang et al.,
2004].
