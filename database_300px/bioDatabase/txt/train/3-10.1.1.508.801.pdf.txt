ABSTRACT
Threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) is a universal
modification found at position 37 of ANN decoding
tRNAs, which imparts a unique structure to the
anticodon loop enhancing its binding to ribosomes
in vitro. Using a combination of bioinformatic,
genetic, structural and biochemical approaches,
the universal protein family YrdC/Sua5 (COG0009)
was shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of
this hypermodified base. Contradictory reports on
the essentiality of both the yrdC wild-type gene of
Escherichia coli and the SUA5 wild-type gene of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae led us to reconstruct
null alleles for both genes and prove that yrdC is
essential in E. coli, whereas SUA5 is dispensable in
yeast but results in severe growth phenotypes.
Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that
the E. coli YrdC protein binds ATP and preferentially
binds RNAThr lacking only the t6A modification. This
work lays the foundation for elucidating the function
of a protein family found in every sequenced
genome to date and understanding the role of t6A
in vivo.
INTRODUCTION
Found in all sequenced genomes to date, the YrdC
(COG0009) family has been ranked in the top 10 con-
served hypothetical proteins to be considered as high pri-
ority targets for experimental study (1). The crystal
structures of two Escherichia coli COG0009 family mem-
bers YrdC and YciO (2,3) reveal an a/b twisted open-
sheet structure with a positively charged cleft in its
center that was proposed to form a nucleic-acid-binding
site (2). Binding to double-stranded RNA (including
tRNA) was experimentally veriﬁed for the E. coli YrdC
protein (YrdCEc) (2). The study of the COG0009 encoding
gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SUA5, preliminarily
addressed the function of this gene family. A mutant
allele, sua5-1 (Ser107 ! Phe replacement) was identiﬁed
as a suppressor of a translation initiation defect in the
leader region of the cyc1-1019 allele of the iso-1-
cytochrome c encoding gene CYC1. In a strain carrying
the cyc1-1019 allele, initiation was shown to occur at an
aberrant up-stream and out of frame ATG (due to a single
base-pair substitution) and resulted in expression of 2%
of the normal Cyc1 protein amount. Interestingly, sup-
pression did not occur at the transcriptional level as
observed for the other sua suppressors identiﬁed in the
same screen (4). A strain carrying a sua5 null mutation
sua5::LEU2 displayed pleiotropic phenotypes that
included; slow growth, cytochrome a.a3 deﬁciency,
decreased cytochrome b levels and inability to grow on
lactate or glycerol (4). The Sua5 protein was implicated
in post-transcriptional modulation on gene expression but
its biochemical function remained uncharacterized (4). In
humans, the YrdC ortholog (YrdCH) was identiﬁed as a
retinoblastoma binding protein 10 (RBBP10) interactor
and a possible role in translation was proposed based on
its high and ubiquitous expression proﬁle in several tissues
including those in which high levels of protein synthesis
occurs (5). The YrdCH ortholog was also identiﬁed as a
new ischemia/reperfusion-inducible protein (IRIP) that
indirectly regulates the activity of a variety of trans-
porters probably through its interaction with RSC1A1, a
modulator of membrane transport with unclear mode of
action (6).
In E. coli, a small deletion of 12 nucleotides including
the initiation codon of yrdC (yrdC) was found to

suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype caused by
prfA1 (an allele of the prfA gene encoding release factor
1). These mutations were found to be inseparable and a
function in ribosome maturation was suggested for yrdC
based on the observation that the double mutant dis-
played slightly higher amounts of 17S rRNA, an immature
form of 16S rRNA (7,8).
In summary, members of the COG009 family seem to
act as cellular regulators, with pleiotropic eﬀects often
linked to translation that vary with the experimental
system. Overall the role at the molecular level of the
YrdC/Sua5 proteins remained unclear. The essentiality
of the gene family also remained and un-resolved issue,
as it appeared to vary with the organism considered and
the approach utilized to construct mutations. In E. coli, no
yrdC deletion mutant was obtained in the systematic
single-gene knockout mutant collection, whereas the
E. coli homolog yciO was successfully deleted in the
same study (9). Also, a yrdC mutant could be isolated in
a prfA1 background, but the two mutations were not dis-
sociable, suggesting again that gene yrdC might be essen-
tial in wild-type E. coli (8). However, conﬂicting results
have been reported when an insertion of a Tn5-araPBAD
construct within the ﬁrst 15 bp of yrdCEc did not lead to
lethality on rich medium supplemented with glucose (10).
In yeast, even though it was isolated as a suppressor, the
sua5::LEU2 allele was dissected away from the original
mutation, and deletion of the gene was successfully
achieved in homozygous backgrounds suggesting that
the gene was not essential (4). However, in the yeast sys-
tematic gene deletion collection, a single SUA5 copy could
be deleted in the diploid background BY4743, and no
deletion was obtained in the haploid background
BY4741 (11).
N6-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A) is an anticodon-
loop modiﬁcation found at position 37 of tRNAs decod-
ing ANN codons. Although considerable biochemical and
biophysical information exists on the function of this
hypermodiﬁed base (1221), the t6A biosynthesis pathway
has only been partially biochemically characterized and
shown to be an ATP-dependent process requiring threo-
nine and carbonate although none of the genes involved in
its biosynthesis have been identiﬁed (22).
In the present study we show by combining a compar-
ative genomic approach with experimental validation that
the YrdC/Sua5 family is involved in t6A biosynthesis. We
also investigated the essentiality of this gene family in two
biological systems, E. coli and yeast. In light of the role of
this gene family in the formation of the critically impor-
tant tRNA modiﬁcation t6A37, hypotheses to explain some
of the pleiotropic eﬀects observed in previous studies are
presented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bioinformatics
Analysis of the COG009 family was performed in the
SEED database (23). We also used the Blast tools and
resources at NCBI (24). Annotations for paralog families
were made using physical clustering on the chromosome
when possible, by building phylogenetic trees using the
ClustalW tool (25) integrated in SEED or by deriving spe-
ciﬁc protein motifs (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/
ESPript/).
Strains and growth conditions
All E. coli and S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are
listed in Table 1. Bacteria were routinely grown on LB
medium (BD Diagnostics Systems) at 37C unless other-
wise stated. Bacterial growth media were solidiﬁed with 15
g/l agar (BD Diagnostics Systems) for the preparation of
plates. Transformation and P1 transductions were per-
formed following standard procedures (26). The sensitivity
to P1 phage of all recipient strains used was veriﬁed.
Ampicillin (Amp, 100 mg/ml), Kanamycin (Km, 50 mg/ml),
L-Arabinose (Ara, 0.020.2%), were used when appro-
priate. Bacterial chromosomal DNA was prepared
using the Qiagen kit DNeasy Tissue Kit and yeast chro-
mosome DNA was prepared using Blood & Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Yeast strains were routinely grown on YPD (DIFCO
Laboratories) at 30C unless otherwise stated. Synthetic
minimal, with or without Agar, SD base or SD base Gal/
Raf with or without dropout (-uracil, -ura; -leucine, -leu;
-histidine, -his) were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto,
CA) and prepared as recommended by the manufacturer.
Glucose (Glu, 2%), Glycerol (Gly, 4%), 5-ﬂuoro-orotic
acid (5-FOA, 0.1%) and G 418 (300 mg/ml) were used
when appropriate. Transformations were carried out as
described in the pYES-DEST52 manual (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).
Cloning and strains constructions
All plasmids constructed are listed in Table 1. Sequences
of all primers used are given in Table 2. The E. coli wild-
type genes yrdCEc (NP_417741) and yciOEc (NP_415783)
were ampliﬁed by PCR from genomic DNA prepared
from strain E. coli K12 MG1655. In a similar fashion
the wild-type gene ywlCBs (NP_391576) was ampliﬁed
from Bacillus subtilis 168 genomic DNA and the wild-
type yeast gene SUA5 (NP_011346) was ampliﬁed from
strain BY4743 genomic DNA. The wild-type gene
yrdCMm (NP 987306) was ampliﬁed from Methanococcus
maripaludis S2 genomic DNA. For subcloning in
pBAD24, all forward primers (ol1) contained an NcoI
sequence and the reverse primers (ol2) contained a
HindIII sequence, while the reverse primer to amplify
SUA5 contained a PstI site, and are BADEcyrdCol1/
BADEcyrdCol2; BADEcyciOol1/BADEcyciOol2; BADB
sywlCol1/BADBsywlCol2; BADMmyrdCol1/BADM
myrdCol2; BADsua5ol1/BADsua5ol2. PCR fragments
were ﬁrst inserted into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen)
and transformed into Top 10 cells (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer protocol. Sequences were
veriﬁed before subcloning into the appropriate sites of
pBAD24 (27).
For subcloning into pYES, the PCR ampliﬁed
products corresponding to the yrdCEc, yciOEc, yrdCMm,
ywlCBs genes were ﬁrst cloned into the entry
vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen), using

pYES-DEST52 (carrying the URA3 gene for selection on
ura media) (Invitrogen) using the Gateway LR Clonase
Enzyme Mix according the manufacturer protocol.
Plasmids were transformed into yeast strains according to
the manufacturer protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Transformants were screened on SD -ura plates and
checked for presence of the orthologous gene in trans
by PCR using the gene-speciﬁc primers used for cloning.
For cloning into pRS313 (28), primers CENupsua5.ol1
and CENdnsua5.ol2 were used to amplify the SUA5 gene
from yeast as well as 272 bp of upstream region and 124
bp of downstream region (UpSUA5Dn). The upstream
region was designed based on previous data showing
that the presence of a 190 bp fragment upstream of
SUA5 is suﬃcient to drive gene expression (4). The PCR
product was cloned into pCR-Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) yielding pBY168.6. After checking by
sequencing, the UpSUA5Dn was cloned into pRS313
using the EcoRI restriction site ﬂanking the insert in
pCR-Blunt and the EcoRI site of pRS313. The resulting
plasmid, pBY176.3 (pRS313::UpSUA5Dn), allows SUA5
to be expressed under its native promoter and was used for
complementation purposes.
For construction of pBN204, the yeast SUA5 gene was
ampliﬁed using forward primer BN1 and reverse primer
BN2 from plasmid pM249 (4). The forward primer
included the yeast initiation sequence AAUA and a
BamHI site. The reverse primer included an XhoI site.
These sites were used to ligate this DNA fragment into
pYES2 (URA3) (Invitrogen) to generate pBN204. For
construction of pBN200, yrdCEc was ampliﬁed from geno-
mic DNA using primers BN3 and BN4 before cloning into
pET21b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) using NdeI and
XhoI.
Construction of the E. coli DyrdCEc-1::Km
R allele
Fragments upstream (908 bp) and downstream (991bp) of
yrdCEc were PCR ampliﬁed from E. coliMG1655 genomic
DNA using US71_ol1 and UP979_ol2, and DS1561_ol1
and DS2552_ol2, respectively. For subcloning purposes,
DS1561_ol1 and DS2552_ol2 contained NotI and
XhoI restriction sites respectively. The yrdCEc upstream
fragment (UpyrdCEc) was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting plasmid
pCR2.1::UpyrdCEc (pBY140) was checked for orientation.
The yrdCEc downstream fragment (DnyrdCEc) was
digested with NotI and XhoI and ligated into pBY140
digested with the same enzymes to give plasmid
pBY141.6. The Upstream::Downstream fragment from
pBY141.6 was then subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector
(Promega) using the ApaI and SacI sites, and the resulting
plasmid pBY146.1 was then digested with the EcoRV site
present between the upstream and the downstream frag-
ments and used to clone the KmR cassette (containing
FRT sites) that had been ampliﬁed from pKD4 (29)
using the FRTKn_ol1 and FRTKn_ol2 primers. The
resulting plasmid pGEM-T easy::UpyrdCEc::
KmR::DnyrdCEc (pBY152.1) was then used as a template
to generate by PCR the UpyrdCEc::Km
R::DnyrdCEc
deletion cassette used for the replacement of yrdCEc.
Induction of  recombination functions and preparation
of NM1100/pBAD24::yrdCEc, NM1100/pBAD24::yciOEc,
and NM1100/pBAD24 competent cells was done as
described in (30). After electroporation, cells were plated
on LB Km supplemented with 0.02% arabinose. Km resis-
tant colonies were re-isolated twice and checked for gene
replacement using Km-speciﬁc primers [k1 and k2, (29)] in

Construction of the sua5-D1::LEU2 allele
Primers sua5leu.ol1 and sua5leu.ol3 were used to amplify
a 1671 bp fragment encompassing SUA5. This fragment
was cloned into pGEMT easy (Promega, Madison, WI)
yielding pBY154. A BglII site exists within the ampliﬁed
fragment and when used deletes about 1000 bp from the
ampliﬁed fragment, while retaining, 225 bp of homology
region on the 50 side (56 of which are the 56 ﬁrst bp of
SUA5) and 323 bp of homology on the 30 side. A leucine
cassette was ampliﬁed from wild-type BY4743 genomic
DNA using primers UPleu.ol1 and DNleu.ol2 that
contained BglII sites and ligated into pBY154 after diges-
tion of both vector and insert by BglII. The resulting
plasmid, pBY164 was used as template to amplify a
Up:sua5-D1::Dn::LEU2 cassette using sua5leu.ol1 and
sua5leu.ol3 primers. The Up::sua5-D1::Dn::LEU2 PCR
product was used to transform yeast cells. Transformants
were plated on SD Gal/Raf -leu and veriﬁed by PCR. To
cure the URA3 marker containing plasmids (plasmid
derived from pYES-DEST52 and pYES2), 10 ml of serial
dilutions of yeast liquid cultures grown in SD Gal/Raf -leu
were spotted onto two diﬀerent types of plates. Plates
containing SD Gal/Raf -ura -leu medium to check for
the presence of expected markers and 5-FOA medium
(SD Gal/Raf supplemented with 50 mg/ml of uracil and
0.1% 5-FOA) to select yeast cells that did not retain the
URA3 carrying plasmid [in presence of the URA3 gene
5-FOA becomes toxic (31)].
Construction of point mutantions in yrdCEc by

Plasmid pBY126 (pBAD24::yrdCEc) was used as a tem-
plate for mutagenesis. Primer pairs EcyrdCLys50Ala.

rg52Ala.ol2, EcyrdCLys53Ala.ol1/EcyrdCLys53Ala.ol2
and EcyrdCArg110Ala.ol1/EcyrdCArg110Ala.ol2, were
used to mutate Lysine at position 50, Arginine at position
52, Lysine at position 53 and, Arginine at position 110
into Alanine. Mutagenesis was performed as described in
the QuickChangesTM Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit from
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All plasmids were checked by
sequencing.
Growth curves
Growth curves were performed using a Bioscreen C MBR
(Oy Growth Curves AB Ltd, Finland) at 30 and at max-
imum shaking. 300 ml of culture was used in each well, and
10 replicates were used for each condition. Yeast cultures
were grown on SD Gal/Raf -his to saturation diluted 200
times in SD Gal/Raf -his before loading on the Bioscreen.
The growth curves presented are representative of 10
replicates.
Puriﬁcation of bulk tRNA
For E. coli derivatives, 1 liter of cultures were grown over-
night at 37C in LB media supplemented with ampicillin
(50 mg/ml) and arabinose when required, harvested, and
then stored at 20C. The cell pellets were defrosted and
resuspended in 20ml of buﬀer (10mM Tris, 10mM
MgCl2, pH 7.4). For yeast cultures, 2 l of cell cultures
were grown to saturation at 30C, harvested and pellets
immediately resuspended in 20 ml of buﬀer (10mM Tris,
10mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). In both cases, the homogenate
was treated with buﬀer-saturated phenol, pH 7.4
(Sigma), the aqueous layer was collected after the phenol
extraction step, and the RNA was precipitated with etha-
nol. The bulk tRNA was then puriﬁed on Nucleobond
AX-400 columns (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain
View, CA) (according to the manufacturer’s protocol)
and precipitated with isopropanol.
HPLC separation coupled with electrospray tandem mass
spectrometry analysis of digested bulk tRNA
To compare the nucleoside constituents of the bulk tRNA
puriﬁed from the diﬀerent strains, samples of each
puriﬁed bulk tRNA preparation were enzymatically
hydrolyzed as described by Pomerantz et al. (32)
Approximately 100 mg of bulk tRNA was digested with
10 units of Nuclease P1 (Sigma), 0.01 units of
Phosphodiesterase I (Sigma) and 3 ml of E. coli Alkaline
Phosphatase (Sigma P4252) in a total volume of 113 ml.
The digested extracts were lyophilized and resuspended in
20 ml of water. The resuspended tRNA degradation
extracts were injected in a LCMS/MS system for sepa-
ration and identiﬁcation of the nucleosides. A C18-RP
(Gemini 5m, 250 4.6 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA,
14 USA) analytical column was used, with a C18 cartridge
to prolong its lifetime. The mobile phase consisted of two
solvents: 250mM of ammonium acetate pH6.0 for solvent
A and 40% acetonitrile for solvent B. The gradient used
for nucleoside separation was performed as previously
described (32). It consisted in an elution gradient of sev-
eral steps: 05% B in 7min, 510% B in 15min, 2550%
B in 5min, 5075% B in 4min and stay at 75% B for
3min, then 75100% B in 8min. The column was
then washed at 100% B for 7min and re-equilibrated at
100% A for 10min. The ﬂow rate used was 1ml/min.
Chromatography was performed at room temperature.
The elution of nucleosides was followed by UV detection
at 254 nm. The HPLC was coupled to a hybrid triple
quadrupole-ion trap (4000 Q-TRAP, Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) mass spectrometer equipped with
a TurboIonSpray (TIS) interface operated in the positive
ion mode. The ESI parameters were: curtain gas (CUR) at
30 psi, the ion source (IS) at 5000V, nebulizer gas (GS1) at
45 psi, TIS gas (GS2) at 45 psi and the TIS probe temper-
ature at 300C. The information-dependent acquisition
(IDA) mode of operation was employed in which a
survey scan from m/z 100600 was acquired followed by
collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the two most
intense ions. Survey and MS/MS spectra for each ﬁve
IDA cycle were accumulated for 1 s and 3 s, respectively.
tRNA extractions and analysis were performed at least
twice independently.
HPLC analysis
After digestion, samples were immediately used for analy-
sis on HPLC. For that, 100 ml of digested sample was
added to a glass HPLC micro-vial and run using
250mM ammonium acetate pH 6 (Organic Solvent A)
and 40% Acetonitrile (Aqueous Solvent B). Samples run
for 60min at a ﬂow rate of 1.5 ml/min in a Suppleco
Discovery C-18 Reverse Phase column (15 cm 4.6mm
 5 um) (Suppleco 504955) detected by a Waters 2487
Dual Wavelength UV/Vis detector. Samples were injected
by a Waters 717 plus Autosampler, and pumped by a
Waters 1525 Binary Pump with a Waters Inline
Degasser. Analysis was done by Waters Breeze Software
v3.20. The method used was a linear gradient consisting of
98% solvent A and 2% solvent B at start with a ﬂow rate
of 1.5 ml/min, decreasing to 80% A and 20% B at 60min
with no change in ﬂow rate.
Preparation of tRNAThr
The plasmid containing the E. coli tRNAThrCGU gene
thrW was a kind gift of Dr Waas (The Scripps Research
Institute). tRNAThrCGU was overexpressed in MRE600
cells induced with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG,
0.5mM, 37C, 12 h) in LB-Amp (100mg/ml). The har-
vested cells were lysed in buﬀer (0.3 M NaOAc, pH 5.2,
10mM EDTA) and subjected to phenol extraction (pH
4.5) and ethanol precipitation. tRNAThr was partially pur-
iﬁed from total nucleic-acid extract on a Nucleobond
column (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA)
using manufacturer protocols, precipitated with isopropy-
lalcohol (100%, room temperature), washed with ethanol
(80%, 20C), and dissolved in water, at which point it
was 80% pure. tRNAThr was further puriﬁed on a C4
reverse-phase preparative column pre-equilibrated with
buﬀer A (10mM sodium phosphate pH 5.5, 1M sodium
formate, 8mM MgCl2) and eluted with a 60-min 040%
gradient of buﬀer B (10mM sodium phosphate pH 5.5,
10% methanol). The tRNA eluted in two equal-sized

peaks. Upon assaying the fractions for threonine accep-
tance from E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase using a stan-
dard aminoacylation assay as described in (33), both
peaks were found to contain tRNAThr at >97% purity.
Treatment with base (pH 8.5) of a pooled sample from
both peaks yielded the same two separate peaks by ana-
lytical reverse-phase chromatography, indicating that the
two species do not correspond to diﬀerent aminoacylation
states. Fractions for the two peaks were pooled separately
and tRNA was precipitated, washed twice with cold etha-
nol, and re-dissolved in water. MALDI-TOF mass spec-
trometry analysis of ﬁnal tRNA from the two peaks
revealed molecular masses of 24 540 and 24 686Da. The
mass diﬀerence is accounted for by the molecular mass of
carbamoyl-threonine (145.12 Da).
The tRNAThr transcript was synthesized by standard T7
polymerase transcription (34) of a linearized DNA tem-
plate [pUC18; (35)] containing the E. coli tRNAThrCGU
gene thrW (kind gift of Dr K. Beebe, The Scripps
Research Institute). After phenolchloroform extraction
of the reaction, the RNA was ethanol precipitated,
re-dissolved in water and puriﬁed by anion-exchange
high-performance liquid chromatography on a heated
(90C) preparative DNA-Pac column (Dionex,
Sunnyvale, CA) according to standard protocols (34).
The single tRNAThr eluant was pooled, ethanol precipi-
tated, re-suspended in water and assayed for threonine
acceptance. Final purity was >95% by 10% urea PAGE
analysis. All ﬁnal tRNA samples were prepared for
binding studies by heating to 90C and slow-cooling
after addition of 5mM MgCl2 to ensure proper
folding.
Overexpression and puriﬁcation of the E. coli YrdC
protein (YrdCEc)
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with a pET21
derivative (Novagen) vector containing the E. coli yrdC
gene (pBN200). The protein was overexpressed by induc-
tion with 1mM IPTG in LB medium containing 100 mg/ml
Amp. Cells were harvested and lysed in buﬀer (20mM
Tris, 500mM NaCl, 28mM imidazole, 1mM b-mercap-
toethanol and protease inhibitor cocktail). The protein
was puriﬁed by Ni-NTA aﬃnity chromatography,
dialyzed against phosphate-buﬀered saline and concen-
trated using a YM-3 Centriprep ﬁlter (Millipore Corp.,
Billerica, MA).
Measurements of YrdCEc binding to tRNA by Trp
ﬂuorescence quenching
We used steady-state techniques to monitor changes in the
intrinsic ﬂuorescence of the two tryptophan side chains (at
positions 89 and 106) of E. coli YrdC upon addition of
tRNA as previously described (2). Using a Jobin Yvon
FluoroMax-3 spectroﬂuorometer (Edison, NJ), with
a cell compartment kept at a constant temperature
of 21C, the ﬂuorescence signal (lex=295 nm;
lem=345 nm) of free YrdC (2 mM in 20mM HEPES,
100mM NaCl, pH 7.5) was taken. Deﬁned volumes of a
concentrated aqueous solution of tRNA were then added
in steps to ﬁnal tRNA concentrations of 0.053.50 mM
and the ﬂuorescence signal was taken after a 3-min incu-
bation period at each step to allow for complete binding.
To correct for dilution eﬀects, the same titration was
repeated with the addition of the same incremental
volumes of water. All readings were corrected for buﬀer
absorption without need for inner ﬁlter correction (absor-
bance at 295 nm by tRNA at its highest concentration was
less than 0.05). Theoretical curves were ﬁtted to the exper-
imental data and dissociation constants were determined
according to the following equation (36):

where I0 and I are the corrected ﬂuorescence intensities

and N0 are the total concentrations of protein and
tRNA, respectively, f is the ﬂuorescence intensity ratio
of bound and free protein, and Kd is the dissociation
constant.
Detection of ATP binding by STD-NMR
NMR experiments were performed at 278K on a Varian
INOVA 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm
triple resonance inverse detection probe. Samples were
prepared in 500ml of 99% D2O PBS buﬀer at pH 7.5
(uncorrected) containing 10mM phosphate, 137mM
NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, 0.5mM MgCl2 and 0.02% NaN3.
Concentration of the NMR sample was 20 mM protein
and 1mM ligand. The STD pulse sequence was implemen-
ted as suggested in (37), with minor variations. The exci-
tation train was composed of 50 ms G4 composite pulses
with 1ms delay between pulses. On-resonance and oﬀ-
resonance irradiations were centered at 1 ppm and
30 ppm, respectively, and the total saturation time was
3 s. Initial FIDs were multiplied by a line broadening
function of 1Hz and zero ﬁlled to twice the original
data size prior to Fourier transformation. A total of 512
scans with 16 dummy scans were acquired, with a recycle
delay of 2 s.
RESULTS
Involvement of the Sua5/YrdC family of proteins
in t6A formation
Bioinformatic identiﬁcation. Analysis of all sequenced
tRNAs (38) suggested that all organisms should have a
t6A biosynthesis pathway. Using the MGDB database
(http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/), a list of orthologous families
present in E. coli K12, S. cerevisiae, B. subtilis 168,
Buchnera aphidicola APS, Wigglesworthia glossinidia,
Wollbachia endosymbiot mel and all the mollicutes in the
database (16 genomes) was generated. This analysis
revealed the existence of 95 orthologous protein families,
mostly related to translation (ribosomal protein, tRNA
synthetases and tRNA modiﬁcation). Only nine of these
families did not have an experimentally veriﬁed function
when this work was initiated but many have been

functionally characterized since. The YrdC/Sua5
(Figure 1A) family was the most probable candidate for
an enzyme involved in t6A biosynthesis for the following
reasons: (i) all organisms sequenced to date have a homo-
log of the YrdC/Sua5 proteins, some organisms, such as
E. coli, have two representatives (YrdC and YciO), but
most have only one; (ii) the YrdC domain is also found
in the enzyme family HypF (2) [involved in the maturation
of the metal center of the Ni-Fe hydrogenase HypE (39)]
which catalyzes chemistries similar to the ones expected in
t6A biosynthesis (22); (iii) YrdC and YciO of E. coli were
found to bind double-stranded RNA and tRNA (2);
(iv) Sua5 in yeast was proposed to be involved in transla-
tion (4).
Figure 1. (A) Schematic representation of the YrdC/Sua5 family. YrdC from E. coli is 192 amino acids, yeast Sua5 is 420 amino acids and the
human IRIP is 279 amino acids with 155 being a mitochondrial signal peptide. The position of the KxR(50)SxN conserved motif is given for the
E. coli sequence. (B) Sequence alignment of the YrdC domain of YrdC and Sua5 family proteins The E. coli YrdC, S. tokodaii Sua5 and E. coli YciO
sequences are aligned based on 3D alignment of the crystal structures. Secondary structure elements from the crystal structure of E. coli YrdC are
shown above the sequences. Red boxes indicate conserved residues in YrdC and YciO families. Residues found to interact with bound AMP in the
S. tokodaii Sua5 crystal structure are indicated by red and black stars. K50 and R52, mutated in the present study and used to distinguish between
the YciO and the YrdC families, are indicated by red stars. S107, the residue mutated in the yeast sua5-1 mutant is indicated by a #. Ec: E. coli,

In vivo experimental validation. In order to examine the
t6A phenotype (i.e. presence or absence of t6A modiﬁca-
tion in RNA) of strains lacking members of the SUA5/
yrdC gene family an existing strain, YJN63 (sua5::LEU2)
(4), which carries a deletion allele of SUA5 was analyzed.
Bulk tRNA was extracted from both YGN63 and a near
isogenic wild-type strain YMH13 (SUA5) (4) and pro-
cessed for LCMS/MS analysis as described in the
‘Materials and Methods’ section. This analysis revealed
that the 25.5min peak detected on the UV trace in the
parent strain, corresponding to the protonated molecular
weight of t6A (MH+= 413m/z), disappeared in the strain
carrying the sua5::LEU2 allele (Figure 2A). The t6A peak
was recovered when this strain was transformed with a
plasmid carrying the wild-type SUA5 gene (plasmid
pBN204) conﬁrming that the t6A phenotype (absence
of t6A peak) was due to the loss of SUA5 (Figure 2A).
To determine whether sua5 homologs were actual func-
tional orthologs, E. coli, B. subtilis and M. maripaludis
yrdC-like genes were tested for their ability to complement
the t6A phenotype of the sua5::LEU2 strain. YGN63 was
transformed with URA3 plasmids carrying the following
wild-type genes: yrdCEc (pBY135.1), yciOEc (pBY136.1),
ywlCBs (pBY137.1) or yrdCMm (pBY138.1). Bulk tRNA
was then extracted and analyzed to check for the presence
of t6A in the transformed strains. All genes with the excep-
tion of yciOEc, were able to complement the t
6A pheno-
type of YJN63 (Figure 2B and C).
Essentiality of yrdC orthologs
Essentiality of S. cerevisae SUA5 wild-type gene. In order
to clarify the contradictory data on the essentiality of
SUA5, the replacement of the wild-type allele by a
sua5-D1::LEU2 cassette was attempted in three diﬀerent
backgrounds (see ‘Material and Methods’ section for con-
struction details): the diploid, BY4743 (SUA5/SUA5
ura3D0/ura3D0 leu2-D0/leu2-D0), the haploid BY4741
(SUA5 ura3D0 leu2-D0) and VDC5309 (SUA5 yrdCEc
URA3 ura3D0) which is strain BY4741 transformed with
a yrdCEc URA3 carrying plasmid (pBY135.1). Leu
+
clones were obtained in all three backgrounds, however,
when analyzed by PCR, only clones derived from the
diploid BY4743 and the merodiploid VDC5309 carried
the sua5-D1::LEU2 marker in the right locus, yielding

yciOEc and ywlCBs, respectively and the recovery of the t
6A peak was monitored. (C) LCMS/MS analysis of yeast tRNA extracted from the

SUA5/sua5-D1::LEU2 and sua5-D1::LEU2 yrdCEc deriva-
tives, respectively (Figure 3A). In the haploid background
BY4741, ectopic insertion of the cassette occurred yielding
SUA5 LEU2 strains, but no correct insertion of the dele-
tion cassette could be obtained. Thus, SUA5 could only be
disrupted in backgrounds where a functional copy
remained present in the genome, suggesting that SUA5
is an essential gene in yeast, and in agreement with the
result of the systematic yeast gene deletion study (11).
In order to further demonstrate the essentiality of
SUA5, attempts were made to dissociate the sua5-D1::
LEU2 allele from the URA3 yrdCEc plasmid pBY135.1.
If SUA5 is essential then the plasmid should not be cur-
able from VDC5416 (sua5-D1::LEU2 pBY135.1), while it
should be readily lost from VDC5417 (SUA5 LEU2
pBY135.1). Since the URA3 allele carried on the plasmid
confers sensitivity to 5-FOA, strains were tested for their
ability to grow in the presence of this compound. Culture
dilutions of VDC5416 were plated on 5-FOA medium and
the resulting growth phenotype compared to that of two
control strains: VDC5417 carrying an ectopic insertion of
the deletion cassette and the heterozygote VDC5300
(SUA5/sua5-D1::LEU2 ura3D0/ura3D0). Derivatives
from both control strains grew in presence of 5-FOA as
expected. After prolonged incubation, 5-FOAR derivatives
of sua5-D1::LEU2 pBY135.1 were also recovered suggest-
ing that pBY135.1 could be eliminated from this
background (Figure 3B). Both the curing of pBY135.1
and the sua5-D1::LEU2 genotype were conﬁrmed by
PCR (Figure 3C) and by plating on SD Gal/Raf agar
plates lacking either uracil/leucine or leucine (data not
shown). These results showed that the SUA5 gene is not
essential in yeast conﬁrming results of a previous study
(4). Further analysis of the growth phenotype of
sua5-D1::LEU2 strains conﬁrmed the growth defect phe-
notypes observed on FOA plates. Growth experiments on
YPD show a dramatic decrease in growth rate of cured
strain VDC5440 compared to the haploid parent strain
BY4741 (Figure 4A). A plasmid carrying SUA5 under
the control of its endogenous promoter region
(pBY176.3) complemented both the t6A deﬁciency of
VDC5440 and the slow growth phenotype (Figure 4B
and C), conﬁrming that it was not due to a secondary
mutation. These results show that neither the gene nor
the modiﬁcation is essential in yeast. The failure to
obtain the haploid mutant by direct transformation is
most likely due to its reduced growth phenotype.
Essentiality of E. coli yrdC. To test whether the yrdCEc
gene is essential or not in E. coli, a similar approach as
that employed for yeast was followed. Homologous
replacement of the wild-type yrdC allele by a yrdCEc-
1::KmR allele was attempted by direct transformation of
a UpyrdCEc::Km
R::DnyrdCEc PCR generated fragment

+ and

location was conﬁrmed. Expected sizes are: 750 bp for sua5-D1::LEU2 allele at the right locus using the Chksua5leu.ol4/Leucassol3 combination and

NM1100/pBAD24 and NM1100/pBAD24::yrdCEc
(pBY126) (see ‘Material and Methods’ section), the
latter strain contains a functional copy of yrdCEc on a
plasmid. Km resistant clones with insertion of the
marker in the expected location (as veriﬁed by PCR)
were obtained in NM1100/pBAD24::yrdCEc but not in
the two other backgrounds suggesting that the chromo-
somal copy of the gene can only be eliminated if its func-
tion is insured by a gene is trans (Figure 5A).
The essentiality of yrdCEc was further demonstrated by
P1 transduction experiments. Strain VDC5173 (NM1100
yrdCEc-1::Km
R/pBAD24::yrdCEc) was used as donor for
P1 transduction with the following strains used as
recipients: MG1655 transformed with pBAD24 deriva-
tives carrying either functional yrdC homologs, yrdCEc,
ywlCBs, yrdCMm or SUA5Sc (pBY126, pBY125, pBY167
and pBY130 respectively) or carrying the non-functional
homolog yciOEc (pBY128). P1 transductions were carried
at least ﬁve times in two independent MG1655 back-
grounds for each ortholog, Km-resistant colonies were
recovered in all backgrounds (with a variation of
120500 colonies per transduction) except MG1655/
pBAD24 and MG1655/pBAD24::yciOEc that never
yielded any colonies (while non-essential markers were
readily transduced in these strains). These data conﬁrm

that yrdCEc is an essential gene in the E. coli strains
MG1655 and NM1100, and supports the result obtained
in yeast, namely that SUA5, yrdCEc, yrdCMm, ywlCBs are
functional orthologs but yciOEc.is not. The pBAD con-
struct places the genes under the control of an arabinose
inducible promoter and among the orthologs, SUA5Sc was
the least proﬁcient in replacing the yrdCEc gene. In the
absence of the inducer, the E. coli strain carrying
yrdCEc-1/pBY130 (pBAD24::SUA5) showed a delayed
growth phenotype not observed for strains carrying the
three other genes (Figure 5B).
Analysis of bulk tRNA extracted from all four classes
of P1 transductants obtained showed that all contained
t6A indicating that these orthologs complement both the
essentiality and tRNA modiﬁcation phenotypes (data not
shown).
Direct involvement of YrdC in t6A biosynthesis
Preferential binding of YrdCEc to apomodiﬁed
tRNAThr. To investigate whether members of the YrdC/
Sua5 family act directly on tRNA in t6A biosynthesis,
YrdCEc binding to a tRNA species known to contain
t6A in E. coli, tRNAThr, was tested. Three forms of
E. coli tRNAThrCGU were generated; two in vivo expressed
forms and one in vitro transcribed form that lacked all
post-transcriptional modiﬁcations. As seen previously by
other investigators (40), overexpression of tRNAThr pro-
duced two forms that diﬀer by the exact molecular mass of
carbamoyl-threonine suggesting that they diﬀer by the
presence or absence of this modiﬁcation at nucleotide
37. Both forms were aminoacylated with ThrRS to similar
degrees indicating that they were properly folded, func-
tional tRNAs. Fluorescence quenching data show that
YrdC binds to fully modiﬁed tRNAThr and to partially
modiﬁed tRNAThr (lacking only the threonyl-carbamoyl
modiﬁcation) with estimated dissociation constants of
0.62±0.13 and 0.11±0.05mM, respectively, indicating
high binding aﬃnity (Figure 6A). Only weak and
apparently non-speciﬁc binding between YrdC and
unmodiﬁed in vitro transcript of tRNAThr could be
detected. These results suggest that YrdC is involved in
t6A biosynthesis by interacting directly with tRNAs, con-
sistent with the previously reported binding of YrdC to
total tRNA (2).
Binding of YrdCEc to ATP. t
6A biosynthesis in crude
enzyme preparations has been shown to require ATP
(22) and the Sua5St ortholog from Sulfolobus tokodaii
has been recently found to bind and hydrolyze ATP
(41). To investigate whether YrdCEc can speciﬁcally bind
ATP, we screened various nucleotides for their potential
to bind YrdC by saturation-transfer diﬀerence NMR
(STD-NMR) spectroscopy. A strong STD-NMR signal
was seen with ATP and ADP but not with CTP and
UTP, indicating adenine-speciﬁc binding (Figure 6B),
and pointing to the presence of one or more ATP-binding
sites in YrdCEc.
Essentiality of E. coli YrdC conserved residues Arg52 and
Lys50. Arg52 and Lys50 residues are strictly conserved
among YrdC proteins but are absent from the YciO pro-
teins (Figure 1B). Both residues are located in the center of
a positively charged cleft that is the putative nucleic-acid-
binding site, and based upon the crystal structure of the
S. tokodaii protein Sua5St, their side chains (Arg59 and
Lys57 using S. tokodaii residue numbering) interact with
and stabilize an AMP derived phosphate group found
bound in the cleft. (41). This suggested that nucleotide
binding by YrdC and Sua5 (41) is critical for function.
To test the functional signiﬁcance of these two residues
in vivo, site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct
E. coli strain MG1655 carrying pBAD24 plasmids harbor-
ing yrdCEc Lys50 ! Ala or Arg52!Ala, and yrdCEc
Arg110!Ala or Lys53!Ala for control (pYC102.3,
pYC104.2, pYC101.1 and pYC103.1, respectively). These
were used in P1 experiments as recipient strains as
described earlier. More than a hundred clones were

MG1655pyrdCEc, MG1655pyrdCEc Arg110!Ala or
MG1655pyrdCEc Lys53!Ala were used as recipients,
but no transductants were recovered when the MG1655/
pYC104.2 and MG1655/pYC102.3 were used, implying
that Arg52 and Lys56 are essential for YrdCEc function.
All receiver strains were tested for sensitivity to P1. These
results suggest that nucleotide binding is essential for the
function of these proteins and are consistent with the
known ATP requirement for t6A biosynthesis (22).
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that the universally conserved YrdC/
Sua5 family is involved in the biosynthesis of N6-threonyl-
carbamoyl adenosine. Deletion of SUA5 led to the loss of
t6A in two independent yeast backgrounds. E. coli YrdC
preferentially bound tRNAThr containing all modiﬁca-
tions but t6A as compared to in vitro (unmodiﬁed) tran-
scribed tRNA. Two invariant residues involved in
nucleotide binding were characterized, strongly indicating
that the role of YrdC/Sua5 in t6A biosynthesis is mediated
by their ATP binding and hydrolyzing functions, and
further suggesting a direct role for this protein in the
biosynthetic pathway, since ATP is required for t6A
formation (22).
The YrdC/Sua5 proteins have been assigned to
COG009 and most organisms have only one member of
this family. Exceptions include plants and several bacteria
that have two homologs. Expression of the second
COG009 encoding gene of E. coli, yciO, failed to comple-
ment the t6A minus phenotype of yeast strains lacking a
functional SUA5 gene. The two subfamilies can also be
distinguished by sequence analysis as residues K50 and
R52 are found at the bottom of a positively charged
concave surface in the crystal structure of YrdC and are
strictly conserved in the YrdC subfamily but absent in
YciO sequences (Figure 1B). These residues are essential
for YrdC function as shown by site directed mutagenesis
and complementation experiments. Therefore COG009
should be split into two sub-families as the results pre-
sented here suggest distinct functions for YciO and YrdC.
Like m1G37 and 55, t6A37 is one of the few tRNA
modiﬁcations present in all organisms for which the
whole set of tRNA sequences is available (38,42). It is
one of the few universal modiﬁcations believed to have
been present in the last common ancestor (43,44) and
every sequenced genome (>600 to date) has a YrdC
ortholog.
In this study the essentiality of this gene family has been
resolved. In E. coli, yrdC appears essential, however
whether the observed lack of viability is due to the absence
of the t6A modiﬁcation still remains to be established. In
apparent contradiction to our results, insertion of the
PBAD promoter within the ﬁrst 15 nucleotides of yrdC
was reported to be lethal under repressing conditions,
namely on minimal but not rich medium (10). The pheno-
type on minimal medium was attributed to polar repres-
sion of the downstream aroE gene (aromatic amino-acid
biosynthetic gene), which is essential for growth on mini-
mal medium, whereas on LB neither aroE nor yrdC was
considered essential. However, since expression from the
pBAD promoter is not completely repressed by glucose
(27,45), expression under pBAD repression may yield suf-
ﬁcient YrdC protein to fulﬁll essential function(s) in the
cell.
In yeast, neither the gene nor the modiﬁcation is essen-
tial, as two SUA5 deletion strains lacking t6A have been
constructed [this study and (4)]. However, t6A strains
display a marked slow growth phenotype [this study and

(4)] and possess defective mitochondria (4). Since mito-
chondria are considered of prokaryotic origin, this result
provides additional evidence that this modiﬁcation plays
an essential role in prokaryotic translation.
The t6A modiﬁcation has been shown to be a determi-
nant for eﬃcient aminoacylation by bacterial Isoleucyl-
tRNA synthetase (IleRS), whereas it is not for yeast
cytoplasmic IleRS (46,47) and this might be the molecular
basis for the requirement of YrdC and Sua5 in bacteria
and the yeast mitochondria, respectively.
Four mitochondrial tRNAs contain t6A (Lys, Ile, Arg2
and Met) however only one yrdC/SUA5 homolog has
been identiﬁed in yeast, and this protein is predicted to
be cytoplasmic (48). In the absence of a mitochondrial
speciﬁc homolog, Sua5 must also be targeted to the mito-
chondria, possibly by alternative translational start site
usage as has been described for proteins such as yeast
Trm5, HTS1, VAS1 and Arabidopsis thaliana alanyl-,
threonyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases (4952).
Strains lacking a member of the YrdC/Sua5 family
resulting in a defective pool of tRNAs, will be instrumen-
tal in studying the in vivo role of this modiﬁcation.
Accurate codonanticodon recognition is critical in insur-
ing the accuracy of translation and the t6A37 modiﬁcation
has been shown to aﬀect this process in vitro, mainly by
preventing the formation of U33-A37 across-the-loop base
pairing interaction, and allowing cross-strand stacking of
A38 and t
6A37 with the ﬁrst position of the codon (15,16,
1820). The t6A modiﬁcation is found in seven E. coli and
12 S. cerevisiae tRNAs, four of which are mitochondrial
(38). As the eﬀects of anticodon-surrounding modiﬁca-
tions in adjusting the thermodynamic properties of antic-
odon/codon interactions for cognate and none-cognate
recognition by the ribosome are context dependent, it is
expected that the absence of t6A in these tRNAs will aﬀect
translation in several ways. This is reﬂected by the pleio-
tropic phenotypes of strains lacking a functional YrdC or
Sua5 (48). In yeast, for example, the sua5-1mutation was
isolated as a suppressor of an initiation defect aﬀecting the
CYC1 gene expression (4). CYC1 is a nuclear gene encod-
ing the iso-1 form of the electron carrier protein cyto-
chrome c which is localized to the mitochondria (53).
The cycl-1019 mutant expresses 2% of the normal
amount of iso-l-cytochrome c due to a single base-pair
substitution that creates an upstream ATG codon that is
out of frame with the normal CYCl translational start.
The sua5-1 point mutation suppressed this translational
defect, restoring Cyc1 levels to 60% of the normal levels
(4). In this sua5 suppressor strain lacking t6A (this study),
Cyc1 protein expression is possibly due to high levels of
frameshift errors during the translation initiated at the
upstream and out of frame ATG, thus restoring the orig-
inal reading frame. The absence of other modiﬁcations at
position 37 such as Wyeosine or m1G has also been shown
to drastically increase frame-shifting in yeast (54,55).
However, the fact that the Cyc1 protein is also expressed
at nearly of wild-type levels in a wild-type CYC1
sua5::LEU2 strain (4), i.e. in the absence of the aberrant
ATG found in the cyc1-1019 allele, suggests yet another
hypothesis. In Eukaryotes, the cytoplasmic initiator
tRNA contains a t6A at position 37, and is restricted to
recognition of AUG alone, while its prokaryotic counter-
part is neither modiﬁed nor restricted to recognizing
AUG, suggesting that this modiﬁcation may play an
important role in selecting the appropriate translational
start site. In the absence of t6A, the scanning ribosome
could initiate at the natural ATG start codon, but also
promiscuously at other ATG or non-ATG codons, as
interactions between initiator tRNAs and their codons
would be less stringent. This would account for the situa-
tion in prokaryotes, where the initiator tRNA is not mod-
iﬁed at position 37 and the ribosome can initiate at either
ATG, GTG or TTG (56). For yeast, the lack of stringent
translational start site selection would lead to several
N-terminal variants, including active forms of the Cyc1
protein and would account for the similar levels of Cyc1
activity seen in both the sua5::LEU2 strain and the
cyc1-1019 sua5-1 suppressor strain.
Finally, other pleiotropic phenotypes linked to the
absence of YrdC/Sua5 members have been observed. In
E. coli, yrdC has been described as a possible ribosome
maturation factor (RimN) needed for correct processing
of 16S ribosomal RNA, and for maintenance of normal
amounts of translating ribosomes (7,8). The ribosome
maturation phenotype may reﬂect an indirect consequence
of the yrdC mutation since tRNA defects due to loss of
modiﬁcations(s) or other cellular malfunctions have been
shown to cause ribosome maturation defects (57).
In conclusion, we propose that the diverse phenotypes
of YrdC/Sua5 mutant strains are due to the central and
primordial role of the t6A modiﬁcation that includes:
insuring accurate decoding, maintaining the reading
frame, selecting the appropriate translation initiation
codon (mainly in Eukaryotes) and, determining recogni-
tion and aminoacylation of tRNAs by prokaryotic and
mitochondrial IleRSs.
Although a biochemical function for the YrdC/Sua5
proteins (i.e. catalytic activity) aside from tRNA and
ATP binding (this study) and ATPase activity (41), has
not been determined, appropriately modiﬁed tRNA sub-
strates appear critical for interacting with these proteins.
We were unable to show threonine binding by YrdC,
under ATP binding conditions, nor incorporation of
threonine in a tRNAThr transcript in the presence of
YrdC (data not shown). Further experimentation using
apomodiﬁed tRNA as a substrate is needed to determine
the role of YrdC in t6A biosynthesis. It is also likely that
other protein partners interact with YrdC especially since
the biosynthesis of t6A is proposed to require two ATP-
dependent steps (58).
