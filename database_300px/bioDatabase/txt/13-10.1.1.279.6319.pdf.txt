ABSTRACT
RNAi efficiency is influenced by local RNA structure
of the target sequence. We studied this structure-
based resistance in detail by targeting a perfect
RNA hairpin and subsequently destabilized its tight
structure by mutation, thereby gradually exposing
the target sequence. Although the tightest RNA
hairpins were completely resistant to RNAi, we
observed an inverse correlation between the overall
target hairpin stability and RNAi efficiency within a
specific thermodynamic stability ("G) range.
Increased RNAi efficiency was shown to be caused
by improved binding of the siRNA to the destabilized
target RNA hairpins. The mutational effects vary for
different target regions. We find an accessible
target 30 end to be most important for RNAi-
mediated inhibition. However, these 30 end effects
cannot be reproduced in siRNA-target RNA-binding
studies in vitro, indicating the important role of RISC
components in the in vivo RNAi reaction. The results
provide a more detailed insight into the impact of
target RNA structure on RNAi and we discuss
several possible implications. With respect to lenti-
viral-mediated delivery of shRNA expression cas-
settes, we present a "G window to destabilize the
shRNA insert for vector improvement, while avoid-
ing RNAi-mediated self-targeting during lentiviral
vector production.
INTRODUCTION
RNA interference (RNAi) is induced by double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA) and results in gene silencing through
sequence-speciﬁc degradation of the target RNA (1).
RNAi provides plants and animals a defense mechanism
against viruses (2–4) and retrotransposons (5,6). The
ribonuclease Dicer processes the long dsRNA replication
intermediates into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of
22 nucleotides (nt) (7–9). These siRNAs are incorpo-
rated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)
that ﬁnds complementary RNA sequences, resulting in
cleavage of the target RNA (10,11). The central catalytic
component of RISC is an Argonaute protein, which
contains the signature domains PAZ and PIWI respon-
sible for binding the siRNA strand (12).
Transfection of synthetic siRNAs into cells or intracel-
lular expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), which
are processed into siRNA duplexes by Dicer, are powerful
tools to suppress gene expression (13–15). Randomly
selected siRNAs against a target show a large variation in
their eﬃcacy (16). Empirical rules on siRNA duplex
features have been reported and improve design of
eﬀective siRNAs. The asymmetry rule for siRNA duplex
ends requires that the 50 end of the antisense strand forms
a less stable end with its complement than the 50 end of the
sense strand (17,18). Related to this rule is the described
requirement of high A/U content at the 50 end of the
antisense strand and high G/C at the 50 end of the sense
strand (19,20). In addition, a number of position-speciﬁc
nucleotides, an unstructured guide-RNA, and an acces-
sible target site have been reported to positively eﬀect
siRNA eﬃciency (19,21–23).
RNAi can be used as a therapeutic strategy against
human pathogenic viruses such as HIV-1 (24). HIV-1
replication can be inhibited transiently by transfection of
synthetic siRNAs targeting viral RNA sequences or
cellular co-factors (25–28). Furthermore, long-term inhi-
bition of HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in
transduced cell lines stably expressing antiviral siRNAs or
shRNAs (29–34). However, HIV-1 escape variants with
nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the siRNA target
sequence do emerge after prolonged culturing (31,35,36).
The emergence of RNAi-resistant variants may be blocked
by a combination-shRNA therapy, which simultaneously
targets multiple conserved viral RNA sequences (34,37).
We demonstrated that HIV-1 can also become resistant
against RNAi by placing the target sequence in a stable

RNA structure, which prevents binding of the siRNA
(36). We also suggested that such structure-based target
occlusion occurs in the RNA genomes of lentiviral vectors
with a shRNA-cassette (59). By inserting these cassettes,
the target sequence will automatically be present in the
vector genome, and self-targeting by the shRNA should
reduce the lentiviral production level. However, since the
target sequence in the genome is also located in this perfect
shRNA hairpin, it is protected against RNAi, ensuring
a normal vector titer. Indeed, when the target in the
lentiviral genome is unstructured, the titer is signiﬁcantly
reduced by the shRNA (38).
The inhibitory eﬀect of target RNA structure on RNAi
eﬃciency has been described in several studies (23,39,40).
These studies compared the eﬃciency of diﬀerent siRNAs
on a ﬁxed target, and found a correlation between target
availability and RNAi eﬃciency. Schubert et al. suggested
that the local free energy of base pairing in the target
region determines RNAi eﬃciency (41). Ideally, one
should test this concept by a mutational analysis of one
target instead of comparing diﬀerent siRNAs with
intrinsically diﬀerent RNAi eﬃcacies. In this scenario,
mutations that aﬀect the RNA structure should not aﬀect
the target sequence itself, such that the same siRNA
inhibitor can be used. In this study, we set out to
determine the exact hairpin stability at which RNAi
suppression occurs by systematically destabilizing a
21-base pair (bp) hairpin structure that occludes the
complete target sequence. We monitored the eﬀects on
siRNA binding in vitro and RNAi eﬃciency in vivo. The 30
end of the mRNA target sequence is initially recognized
by bases 2–5 of the antisense/guide strand siRNA,
therefore named the ‘seed’ sequence (42,43). Thus, one
may expect a more prominent eﬀect of an accessible target
30 end, which primed us to address positional eﬀects when
destabilizing the target hairpin. The results demonstrate a
clear correlation between the overall stability of the target
hairpin and RNAi eﬃciency, but positional eﬀects were
also apparent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid constructs
The luciferase plasmids pGL3-wt, pGL3-T1 to pGL3-T7
(Figure 1B) and pGL3-A to pGL3-G (Figure 3A) were
constructed by annealing of forward (fwd) and reverse
(rev) oligonucleotides (Supplementary Data, Table 1) and
ligation into the EcoRI and PstI sites of the ﬁreﬂy
luciferase expression vector pGL3-Nef (36). The
pSUPER-shPol vector (34) encodes an eﬀective shRNA
against a conserved 19-nt HIV-1 region (Pol1;
ACAGGAGCAGAUGAUACAG) under the control of
an H1 polymerase III promoter (13). The plasmid
pRL-CMV (Promega) expresses Renilla luciferase under
control of the CMV promoter.
Cell culture and luciferase assays
C33A cervix carcinoma cells were grown as a monolayer
in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% FCS, minimal essential medium nonessential
amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml
streptomycin at 378C and 5% CO2. C33A cells were
grown in 1ml culture medium in 2 cm2 wells to 60%
conﬂuence and transfected by the calcium phosphate
method. The pGL3-variant (100 ng) was mixed with 0.5 ng
pRL-CMV, 0.1–100 ng pSUPER-shPol and pBluescriptII
(KS+) (Stratagene) to have 1 mg of DNA in 15 ml water.
The DNA was mixed with 25 ml of 2 HBS and 10 ml of
0.6MCaCl2, incubated at room temperature for 20min
and added to the culture medium. The culture medium
was refreshed after 16 h, and cells were lysed after another
24 h. Fireﬂy and Renilla luciferase activities were mea-
sured with the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega) as described previously (36).
RT-PCR
C33A cells (2 cm2) transfected with 100 ng pGL3-variants
and 0 or 10 ng pSUPER-shPol were lysed 2 days after
transfection. Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed
by DNase treatment using the TURBO DNA-freeTM kit
(Ambion). First strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 mg
of total RNA, ThermoscriptTM reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen), and primers. The gene-speciﬁc primers used
were EWr6 (50-GCCCCGACTCTAGACTGCAG-30)
for Fireﬂy luciferase and 30HC-b-ACTIN
(50-TGTGTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG-30) for actin.
PCR ampliﬁcation (25 cycles) was performed on 2, 0.4,
0.08 or 0.016 ml RT product with Fireﬂy luciferase
primers EWr6 and GL3pcr-RT (50-GCTGAATTGG
AAT-CCATCTT-30) or actin primers 30HC-b-ACTIN
and 50HC-b-ACTIN (50-GGGAAATCGT-GCGTGA
CATTAAG-30). The PCR products, respectively 398 and
275 bp, were run on a 1.5% agarose gel.
In vitro transcription and electrophoretic mobility
shift assay (EMSA)
The pGL3-variant plasmids were used as template for
PCR ampliﬁcation with primers EWr8 (50-
TCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTCCCCACAGGA
GCAGATGA-30; T7 RNA-polymerase promoter in ita-
lics) and EWr9 (50- GACTCTAGACTGCAGAAAAC
-30). The resulting PCR product contains a T7 RNA-
polymerase promoter upstream of the hairpin (hairpin nt
underlined). DNA products were puriﬁed from agarose
gel using QiaexII Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA
transcripts were produced by in vitro transcription with
the Megashortscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion), and
transcripts were checked for integrity and isolated from an
8% acrylamide gel. RNA concentrations were determined
by spectrophotometry.
The siRNA-Pol antisense/guide oligonucleotide
CUGUAUCAUCUGCUCCU-GU (Eurogentec) was 50
end labeled with the kinaseMax kit (Ambion) and 1 ml
[g-32P] ATP (0.37MBq/ml, Amersham Biosciences). The
target hairpin RNAs were denatured in 30 ml water at
858C for 3min followed by snap cooling on ice. After
addition of 10 ml 4 MO buﬀer (ﬁnal concentration:
125mM KAc, 2.5mMMgAc, 25mM HEPES, pH 7.0),

the RNA was renatured at 378C for 30min. The
transcripts were diluted in 1 MO buﬀer to a ﬁnal
concentration varying from 0 to 1.0 mM in MO buﬀer.
Unlabeled tRNA (1 mg) was added as competitor to each
reaction to minimize aspeciﬁc RNA interactions. The 50-
labeled oligonucleotide (1.0 nM) was added and the
samples (20 ml) were incubated for 30min at 378C. After
adding 4 ml non-denaturing loading buﬀer (50% glycerol
with bromophenol blue), the sample was analyzed on a
non-denaturing 4% acrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was
performed at 150V at room temperature and the gel was
subsequently dried. Quantiﬁcation of the free and bound
oligonucleotide was performed with a Phosphor Imager
(Molecular Dynamics).
In silicoRNA analysis
The structure and stability of the target hairpins cloned
into the pGL3-variants was predicted with the RNA
Mfold program (44,45) at http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/
applications/mfold. The indicated G in Figure 1B and
Figure 3A are derived by importing the hairpin sequences
into the program (54 nt total: 50 CCCC+hairpin
sequences+UUU) and did not contain luciferase
sequences. The presence of the predicted hairpin struc-
tures in the context of the luciferase reporter construct was
veriﬁed by importing longer sequences (150 nt total;
52 nt+hairpin sequences+51 nt) into Mfold.
RESULTS
Target hairpin destabilization triggers RNAi
We investigated the eﬀect of target RNA structure on
RNAi eﬃciency. As a model system we used a very potent
shRNA inhibitor that is directed against the Pol gene of
HIV-1 (Figure 1A; left) and that has been tested
extensively against HIV-1 and appropriate reporter
genes (34). Such a luciferase reporter with the HIV-1 Pol
target sequence in the 30 UTR is shown in Figure 1A
(right). Next, we made the target inaccessible by inclusion
in a perfect hairpin of G=36.6 kcal/mol (Figure 1B;
wild type (wt), the target sequence is marked in gray). In
fact, this hairpin structure is identical to the shRNA itself.
The top 2 bp and the 5-nt loop are standard in the
optimized pSUPER system (13). We systematically
destabilized this target hairpin in mutants T1–T7 by
introducing nt substitutions in the descending strand of
the stem (encircled in Figure 1B), thus leaving the target
sequence intact. The mutations were chosen such that the
predicted thermodynamic stability (G) decreases gradu-
ally. We ﬁrst destabilized the hairpin by replacing stable
G-C by weak G-U base pairs (mutants T1–T3), followed
by more gross destabilizations, e.g. by introducing
mismatches (mutants T4–T7). The G value was reduced
in a step-wise manner to 7.2 kcal/mol for mutant T7.
To accurately quantify the RNAi eﬃciency against
these diﬀerentially structured targets, we placed them
downstream of the luciferase reporter gene (Figure 1A;
right). These constructs were co-transfected into cells with
increasing amounts of the shRNA-Pol expression vector
and luciferase expression was measured after 48 h
(Figure 1C). Expression of the reporter construct with
the target sequence embedded in the wt hairpin was
completely resistant against shRNA-Pol. The same
expression pattern was observed for the T1 construct,
but T2 already showed some susceptibility for RNAi-
mediated inhibition with higher amounts of shRNA-Pol,
with a maximal inhibition of 34% (66% residual luciferase
expression). The next reporter constructs (T3,T4) showed
a signiﬁcant drop in luciferase expression (64% inhibi-
tion). Inhibition of the remaining destabilized target
hairpins (T5–T7) was very eﬀective, showing more than
80% inhibition. This is similar to the maximal inhibition
level that can be obtained with this potent shRNA
inhibitor against a reporter with the 19-nt target sequence
in an unstructured setting [(34) and results not shown]. To
verify that the reduction of luciferase expression is due to
mRNA degradation, we performed a semi-quantitative
RT-PCR on cellular RNA (Figure 1E). Consistent with
the luciferase assays, the levels of mRNA are increasingly
diminished for transfections with the constructs T2 to T7
and shRNA-Pol. The near absence of PCR product for
construct T0, with or without shRNA-Pol, indicates an
ineﬃcient RT reaction through a perfect hairpin. There
were no PCR products when RNA was used as input for
the PCRs (results not shown).
We plotted the measured level of luciferase expression
against the predicted stability of the target hairpins
(Figure 1D). The results suggest an inverse linear
correlation between RNAi-susceptibility and target hair-
pin stability in the 30/15 kcal/mol range. The curve
shows two plateaus. A reduction in hairpin stability from
36 to 30 kcal/mol does not signiﬁcantly induce RNAi-
mediated inhibition (520% inhibition), and further
destabilization above 15 kcal/mol shows no signiﬁcant
improvement of the already maximal inhibition of 86%.
Target hairpin destabilization triggers siRNA binding
To demonstrate that the increased RNAi eﬃciency on
destabilized target hairpins is due to more eﬃcient binding
of the siRNA, we performed in vitro binding experiments
by means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).
For this, we used short T7 transcripts with the complete
hairpin and a 19-nt RNA oligonucleotide, which corre-
sponds to the antisense/guide strand of the siRNA-Pol
(complementary to boxed sequence in Figure 1B). The
siRNA was radioactively labeled and incubated with
increasing amounts of target transcript (wt, T1–T7), and
subsequently analyzed on a non-denaturing acrylamide gel
(Figure 2A). Binding of siRNA to the target RNA leads to
duplex formation that results in a band shift on the gel.
Unbound siRNA and the siRNA/target RNA duplex were
quantiﬁed to calculate the percentage of binding
(Figure 2B).
We performed the binding experiment multiple times
with 0.2 mM target RNA because eﬃcient binding can be
observed, yet most variants stay within the linear range of
the binding assay. We plotted these binding percentages
against the predicted stability of the target hairpins
(Figure 2C). A general trend can be observed that is the
opposite of the graph in Figure 1D: reduced hairpin
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 13 4325
stability results in more eﬃcient binding of the siRNA to
the target RNA. Thus, a decrease in the stability of the
target hairpin increases RNAi eﬃciency due to more
eﬃcient binding of the siRNA. The largest improvement
in RNA–RNA interaction and RNAi eﬃciency is
observed for mutant T3 in comparison with T2, indicating
that a threshold stability is passed by going from
G=27.1 to 21.7 kcal/mol.
Accessibility of the 30 end of the target sequence
is beneficial for RNAi
We globally determined the stability at which hairpin
structures become inhibitory to the RNAi machinery.
However, not all domains within the 19-nt target sequence
may contribute equally to siRNA binding and the RNAi
mechanism. For instance, it has previously been suggested
that the 30 end of the target sequence is initially recognized
by the siRNA within RISC (43). To test this, we made a
second set of Luc-target constructs (Figure 3A, mutants
A–G). By introducing clustered mutations in the target
hairpin, we destabilized either the 30 end, the center or the
50 end of the target sequence. Modest G-U changes were
introduced in mutants A (30), B (center) and C (50). More
gross destabilizing mutations were introduced in mutants
D (30), E (center) and F (50). However, it is apparent that
the two mutations in D have a more modest eﬀect on the
G value because a realignment of the sequences trigger
an alternative folding of the top of the hairpin. We
therefore constructed the additional mutant G with three
mutations to obtain a hairpin with a destabilized 30 target
end that is comparable in G to hairpins E and F. Target
hairpins A through G were cloned in the luciferase
reporter and co-transfected into cells with increasing
amounts of the shRNA-Pol expression vector to quantify
the RNAi eﬃciency (results not shown).
The luciferase values obtained with 10 ng shRNA-Pol
were plotted against the predicted hairpin stability
(Figure 3B, left) and we zoom in on a smaller G range
(Figure 3B; right graph). The target hairpins A, B and C
follow the general trend that we described previously (gray
dotted trend line). Independent of where the hairpin is
destabilized, the introduction of G-U base pairs is a too
modest manipulation to trigger RNAi activity. The target
hairpins E, F and G have more dramatic changes that
reduce the overall hairpin stability to 25/26 kcal/mol,
which should become susceptible to RNAi according to
the previous results. However, mutants F (50) and E
(center) remain largely insensitive, but mutant G with a
free 30 end shows increased RNAi sensitivity when
compared to the trend line. Even the D mutant with a
more modest destabilization of the target 30 end shows
reasonable RNAi activity and clearly drops below the
trend line. These results conﬁrm the importance of initial
recognition of the 30 target end, which explains the
deviations from the general trend.

the RNAi mechanism
We performed in vitro binding experiments to study the
A–G mutants for their ability to bind the siRNA. The
radioactively labeled siRNA was incubated with increas-
ing amounts of the target transcripts A–G and analyzed
on gel (Figure 4A). The shifts representing the siRNA/
target RNA duplex and the free siRNA bands were
quantiﬁed to calculate the percentage of binding
(Figure 4B).
The percentage of binding with 0.2 mM target RNA was
plotted against the predicted stabilities of the target
hairpins (Figure 4C). Remarkably, these in vitro binding
results diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the in vivo RNAi results.
The target hairpins D and G (both 30), which are eﬃciently
targeted by RNAi in the luciferase assay (Figure 3B), are
ineﬃcient in siRNA binding. In contrast, the target

hairpins F (50) and G (center) showed a slightly increased
binding eﬃciency, although these construct were relatively
more RNAi resistant in the luciferase assay. These results
may reﬂect the oversimpliﬁcation of the in vitro binding
assay and point to a contribution of the RISC/siRNA
complex in the recognition and binding of the target
sequence in vivo.
DISCUSSION
It has been proposed that RNAi eﬃciency is inﬂuenced by
the local RNA structure of the targeted sequence. We
investigated this phenomenon in detail by placement of
the target sequence in a perfect hairpin structure
(G=36.6 kcal/mol), which indeed resisted RNAi.
Subsequently we destabilized this tight target structure
resulting in a gradual exposure of the target sequence.
Destabilization of the hairpin structure has little eﬀect on
RNAi activity until a threshold is reached
(G30 kcal/mol). Beyond this threshold we demon-
strate an inverse correlation between hairpin stability and
RNAi-mediated inhibition. Maximal RNAi eﬃciency was
observed with hairpins of G15 kcal/mol. In vitro
binding experiments suggested that the increase of RNAi-
mediated inhibition is due to eﬃcient siRNA binding to
the destabilized target RNA hairpins.
When we introduced position-speciﬁc mutations in the
target hairpin, we observed RNAi eﬃciencies that deviate
from this trend. Hairpins with an opened 50 end or central
part of the target sequence show less RNAi activity than
predicted based on their overall stability. In contrast,
hairpins with an opened 30 end are more susceptible to
RNAi than expected. These results are consistent with the
current notion that the 30 region of the target is initially
recognized and bound by the RISC/siRNA complex (43).
This model is supported by structural data on RISC
bound to the siRNA strand. The 30 end of the siRNA is
recognized and bound in a pocket by the PAZ domain of
the Argonaute protein (46). The 50 end of the siRNA is
anchored at the PIWI domain of Argonaute and these 50
nucleotides are readily accessible for base pairing to
complementary 30 nucleotides of the target RNA (47,48).

The importance of the target 30 end was also revealed in
experiments that selected for viruses that resist RNAi-
mediated inhibition. We described a unique HIV-1 escape
variant that acquired a mutation outside the 19-nt target,
which forces the RNA into an alternative structure that
occludes the 30 end of the target (36).
Besides the in vivo RNAi measurements, we also tested
the diﬀerent RNA targets for their ability to interact with
the siRNA in vitro. The overall G eﬀect of stable target
hairpins is conﬁrmed in this simpliﬁed in vitro setting,
demonstrating that RNAi resistance is due to the inability
of the siRNA to interact with the base-paired stem of the
hairpin. We realize that the siRNA does not act by itself
in vivo as it is part of RISC, of which the helicase activity
may aﬀect local structure in the target RNA (49). In fact,
we observed an interesting discrepancy between the in vivo
and in vitro results for the 50/center/30-destabilized hair-
pins. We observed that an accessible 30 target is key for
RNAi activity, but this eﬀect was not seen in vitro. This
result may indicate an important contribution of RISC in
the siRNA-target RNA annealing step.
Thus, target RNA structure is an important factor when
selecting a suitable target sequence, as it can have a
negative eﬀect on RNAi eﬃciency. For instance, it has
been shown that the TAR hairpin of the HIV-1 genome is
an unsuitable target because of its tight structure
(31,40,50). On the other hand, it is obvious that an
accessible sequence does not automatically make a good
siRNA target (31), as the matching siRNA may not meet
the criteria of an eﬀective siRNA (51). It has been
proposed to include a calculation of the amount of
hydrogen bonds within the target sequence as a parameter
for eﬃcient target sequences (39). We provide a G
threshold at which an hairpin RNA structure becomes
inaccessible, and we diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent target
positions. When designing antiviral siRNAs one may also
consider ways to obstruct viral escape via folding of an
alternative target RNA structure (36). The local RNA
region should be screened for the absence of alternative
foldings that occlude the 30 end of the target and that can
be selected by one or two mutations. If not available, the
genetic threshold for structure-based escape might prove
too high, even for a fast evolving virus like HIV-1.
RNA structure-mediated resistance against RNAi is in
fact beneﬁcial when expressing highly structured shRNAs
or miRNAs in cells. For instance, the incorporation of
shRNA cassettes in a lentiviral vector is potentially
problematic, because the shRNA will target the viral
RNA genome during vector production, thus reducing the
titer. Such self-targeting has not been reported (52,53), we
think because the target is not accessible as part of the
perfectly base-paired shRNA hairpin. The apparent
absence of such self-targeting is particularly important
for the development of multi-shRNA lentiviral vectors
without titer reduction. However, placing many tight
RNA structures in the vector genome may negatively
inﬂuence the titer by other means. For instance, reverse
transcription is very sensitive to excessively stable RNA
structure (54) and RNA polymerase II transcription may
pause at sites where the RNA products folds stable hairpin
structures (55). We did indeed observe that four shRNA
cassettes reduce the lentiviral vector titer (ter Brake,
unpublished data). Destabilizing the introduced shRNAs
may avoid such vector problems, and provide additional
beneﬁts for cloning and sequencing of inverted repeat
sequences (56). In our target model system, we mutated
the antisense strand of the shRNA hairpin, leaving the
sense target sequence intact. In the case of a true shRNA
expression cassette, modiﬁcations will be made in the
sense (target) strand to leave the guide/antisense siRNA
strand unaltered. The obvious advantage will be reduced
complementarity between the target and the siRNA
inhibitor. The impact of such mutations on self-targeting
is likely to depend on the position and type of mismatches

that are introduced (57,58). It is therefore impossible to
make general rules for shRNA design and destabilization
as each hairpin RNA structure will have its unique
characteristics as target and eﬀector in the RNAi
mechanism. Here we demonstrate a G window for
shRNA-Pol destabilization without activating RNAi self-
targeting, which may provide a guideline for other
shRNAs. Positional eﬀects should be considered, and
hairpins may be destabilized to G=25 kcal/mol as
long as the target 30 end remains base-paired. It is too
early to deﬁne more general guidelines for structured
RNA motifs other than the man-made, perfectly base-
paired shRNA hairpins, as natural RNA structures diﬀer
signiﬁcantly in their topology and architecture.
