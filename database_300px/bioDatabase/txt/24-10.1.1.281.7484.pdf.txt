ABSTRACT
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleo-
capsid protein (NC) is a nucleic acid chaperone that
catalyzes the rearrangement of nucleic acids into
their thermodynamically most stable structures. In
the present study, a combination of optical and ther-
modynamic techniques were used to characterize the
influence of NC on the secondary structure, thermal
stability and energetics of monomolecular DNA quad-
ruplexes formed by the sequence d(GGTTGGTG-
TGGTTGG) in the presence of K1 or Sr21. Circular
dichroism studies demonstrate that NC effectively
unfolds the quadruplexes. Studies carried out with
NC variants suggest that destabilization is mediated
by the zinc fingers of NC. Calorimetric studies reveal
that NC destabilization is enthalpic in origin, probably
owing to unstacking of the G-quartets upon protein
binding. In contrast, parallel studies performed on
a related DNA duplex reveal that under conditions
where NC readily destabilizes and unfolds the
quadruplexes, its effect on the DNA duplex is much
less pronounced. The differences in NC’s ability to
destabilize quadruplex versus duplex is in accord-
ance with the higher DG of melting for the latter,
and with the inverse correlation between nucleic
acid stability and the destabilizing activity of NC.
INTRODUCTION
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) carries its
genetic information on a single-stranded RNA that is reverse
transcribed into double-stranded DNA before integration into
the host cell’s genome. Reverse transcription involves a com-
plicated series of biochemical reactions and strand transfer
events. It has been shown that plus-strand DNA synthesis
terminates by a strand displacement synthesis at the center
of the DNA duplex, which generates a ‘flap’ of 99 nt (1,2).
As a result, there exists at the center of the DNA genome a
three-stranded region with two identical plus-strands and the
complementary minus-strand segment, which appears to be
important for proper replication of HIV-1 (2–4). Both plus-
strands contain two adjacent guanine tracts consisting of four
and six guanines in a row, separated by 9 nt (5). It has been
shown that the G-tracts can be involved in the formation of
G-quartets (6); these are formed by four guanine residues
associated in a square planar configuration, where each
guanine interacts with its two neighbors through Hoogsteen
hydrogen bonds (8 per quartet). The formation of G-quartets
requires the presence of cations that bind specifically to guan-
ine O6 carbonyl groups between the planes of the G-quartets.
Owing to the cation coordination and stacking interactions
between G-quartets, quadruplexes are remarkably stable.
The stability depends strongly on the size of the cation,
with the most favorable ionic radius between 1.3 and 1.4 s
(e.g. K+ or Sr2+) (7–9).
The HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) is a small, highly
basic protein containing 15 positively charged amino acids
out of a total of 55 (10–13). Owing to its high charge density,
NC strongly binds and aggregates nucleic acids. NC also con-
tains two zinc finger motifs of the CCHC type, which are
involved in sequence-specific binding to DNA or RNA
single-stranded regions (14–16). It has been reported that
NC facilitates reverse transcription by accelerating tRNA pri-
mer annealing (17–19), minus- and plus-strand transfer reac-
tions (20–22) and strand displacement synthesis that produces
the central DNA flap (1). In the latter work, a full-length DNA
flap was investigated using an in vitro assay that mimics HIV-1
strand displacement synthesis. Optimal conditions that enable
synthesis of the complete central flap in vitro in the presence of
NC have been achieved. Based on this experiment, it was
suggested that NC facilitates structural reorganization within
the flap, which in turn accelerates the displacement synthesis
(1). Recently, it was shown that NC preferentially recognizes
the intermolecular G-quadruplex structures formed by the
sequences derived from the DNA flap (6).
Here, we further characterize the interaction between NC
and G-quartets. The oligonucleotide d(GGTTGGTGTGGT-

two G-quartets connected by a TGT and two TT loops, was
used in this work (Figure 1A) (23,24). This quadruplex was
shown previously to bind thrombin with high affinity and is
therefore referred to as the thrombin binding aptamer (TBA)
(25). There are several reasons for using this particular
molecule in our study: (i) the quadruplex forms readily in
solution (9); (ii) the sequence contains only guanines and
thymidines, which are the preferred binding sites for NC
(14,26,27); (iii) depending on the identity of the counterion,
TBA forms quadruplexes of different stability (9); and (iv) by
simple counterion exchange (for instance, Cs+ for K+), the
entire folding process of the quadruplex may be monitored
at ambient temperature (9).
Here, we study the effect of NC on the thermodynamic
properties of the TBA quadruplex and a related DNA duplex
(Figure 1B) using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultra-
violet (UV) melting experiments and isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC). CD experiments allowed us to evaluate
the influence of NC on the secondary structure of the DNA
molecules, while UV melting studies and ITC measured the
effect of NC on the stabilization/destabilization of the duplex
or the quadruplex formed in the presence of different cations.
Taken together, these studies show that NC destabilizes vari-
ous monomolecular quadruplex structures, even at low con-
centrations of the protein (1 NC per 15 nt). Addition of a
second equivalent of NC results in further quadruplex destabil-
ization. Removal of Zn2+ ions from NC results in a complete
loss of the quadruplex destabilization activity of the protein,
whereas deletion of the N-terminal basic domain while retain-
ing the Zn finger structures does not affect the destabilization
activity. Interestingly, under conditions where we observe
quadruplex unfolding, NC has only moderate, if any, effects
on the thermal stability and the secondary structure of the
DNA duplex.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Proteins and nucleic acids
NC was prepared by solid-phase synthesis, cleaved, purified
and activated with Zn2+, as will be described elsewhere. The
truncated NC(11–55), with its C-terminal a carboxylic acid
and its N-terminal a free amine, was prepared similarly; the
structure was confirmed by ESI-MS: m/z for [M + 7H]calc.:
783.4; m/z for [M + 7H]found: 783.4.
DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Eppley
Research Institute at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center; they were high-performance liquid chromatography
purified and desalted by dialysis against water at 4C using
Spectrum dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of
500 Da. The concentrations of the oligonucleotides were
determined at 260 nm and 80C, using the following molar
extinction coefficients (given in mM1 cm1 of strands): 145
for d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG) and 141 for d(CCAACCA-
CACCAACC). These values were calculated using procedures
reported earlier (28). All solutions contained 10 mM Cs–
HEPES at pH 7.5. UV unfolding and CD studies on the
TBA quadruplexes were performed in the presence of either
50 mM KCl or 10 mM SrCl2, as indicated in the figure legends.
CD spectroscopy
CD spectra were obtained with a JASCO J710 spectropolari-
meter equipped with a water-jacketed cell holder using 10 mm
path length cells. Typically, the solutions of DNA oligonuc-
leotides in the desired buffer were titrated by stepwise addition
of 3–5 ml aliquots of NC, from 0.8 to 1 mM stock solution,
directly into optical cells. NC alone does not contribute to the
CD signal between 230 and 350 nm.
UV melting experiments
UV absorption readings were taken as a function of temper-
ature, using a GBC 918 spectrophotometer equipped with
thermoelectrically controlled cell holders. The melting curves
were recorded at either 260 or 300 nm. In a typical experiment,
DNA and/or NC samples were mixed and diluted into the
desired degassed buffers in optical cuvettes. The NC-free
solutions were incubated at 80C for 20 min in the cell
holder. The temperature was then ramped to the desired start-
ing temperature, NC was added and the melting experiments
were performed at a heating rate of 0.5C/min. Melting curves
allowed an estimation of melting temperature, Tm, the mid-
point temperature of the unfolding process. Then, van’t Hoff
enthalpies, DHvH, were calculated using the equation
DHvH ¼ 6RTm2 da/dT (29).
ITC measurements
A MicroCal MCS calorimeter was used to measure the heat
evolved during quadruplex or duplex formation. In the case of
quadruplex formation, the oligonucleotide solution without or
with NC protein was placed in the reaction cell and titrated
with K+ or Sr2+. Typically, 5 or 10 ml aliquots of salt solution
(1–5 mM) were injected into the oligonucleotide solution
(5–10 mM) by a syringe spinning at 400 r.p.m. The heat of
duplex formation was followed by titrating TBA (30 mM)
into its complementary strand, d(CCAACCACACCAACC)
(2–3 mM). In the experiments with NC, both oligonucleotides
in the cell and in the syringe were premixed with the desired
amounts of NC. The resulting curves were corrected by sub-
tracting the signal obtained from control experiments in which
the cation or oligonucleotide solutions were injected into
the buffer. The data analysis program provided by MicroCal
was used to obtain the number of binding sites, n, the bind-
ing constants, K, and the enthalpies of binding, DH. Free

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
CD measurements
CD spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for probing the sec-
ondary structure of nucleic acids, particularly of quadruplexes.
Upon folding of the TBA quadruplex, the absolute value of the
CD signal between 220 and 320 nm increases several fold (9).
For the present work, we have used CD spectroscopy to deter-
mine the influence of NC on the secondary structures of both
the monomolecular TBA quadruplex and of a DNA duplex
formed by annealing the TBA sequence to a perfectly com-
plementary oligonucleotide. In addition to wild-type synthetic
NC, we studied two derivatives of NC: (i) a truncated poly-
peptide retaining Zn2+, but lacking the N-terminal basic
domain, i.e. NC(11–55) and (ii) an unstructured polypeptide
formed by removal of Zn2+ ions with EDTA treatment.
Quadruplexes. Figure 2A shows the CD spectra of K-TBA in
50 mM KCl, 10 mM Cs–HEPES at pH 7.5 and 20C. The
spectrum before adding NC is characteristic for the potassium
salt of TBA: positive bands with maxima 245 and 295 nm
and a negative peak 268 nm (9) (Figure 2A, open circles).
NC protein significantly changes the CD profile of the quad-
ruplex: drops by 18% ellipticity at all bands upon the addi-
tion of 1 NC per TBA (Figure 2A, closed circles). Addition of
a second equivalent of NC has a similar effect (Figure 2A,
closed squares). Although the addition of a third NC per TBA
also shows an effect, parallel measurements of optical absorp-
tion at 350 nm reveals some aggregation; therefore, this result
is not shown here. The CD profiles in Figure 2A also reveal
isosbestic points 258 and 280 nm, which indicate the two-
state nature of the structural transition of the quadruplex upon
NC binding. It is interesting that the same isosbestic points are
observed during folding of the TBA quadruplex by K+ ions
(Figure 2B). This observation shows that NC cooperatively
unfolds the quadruplex structure and suggests that each equi-
valent of NC added results in complete unfolding of a certain
fraction of quadruplex molecules, while the remaining
molecules stay folded. These conclusions are also supported
by UV melting and ITC experiments as described below. CD
characterization of Sr-TBA, which is significantly more stable
than K-TBA based on an 18C difference in Tm (9), also
reveals similarly strong destabilization of the quadruplex by
NC (Supplementary Material, Figure S1).
We also studied the effect of NC on two other monomo-
lecular quadruplexes: K+ salts of (GGGTTA)3GGG and
(GGGT)4. The first quadruplex is derived from the human
telomere sequence and its Na+ form was reported previously
to be stabilized by NC (6). The latter quadruplex was chosen
based on its significantly higher stability [Tm increased by
42C compared to K-TBA (30)], which is attributed to the
presence of highly ordered loops in the presence of either Na+
or K+ (30,31). Figure 3A reveals that NC effectively unfolds
the (GGGTTA)3GGG quadruplex; in the presence of two equi-
valents of NC, the CD signal at the positive bands drops by
20% (K+) and 60% (Na+), respectively. Similarly, a 30%
decrease in the CD signal was observed upon the addition
of two equivalents of NC to (GGGT)4 (Figure 3B). The dis-
crepancy between the present study, which shows almost com-
plete unfolding of the human telomere repeat in the presence
of Na+, and earlier work (6) that reported NC-induced stabil-
ization of (GGGTTA)3GGG, likely reflects differences in total
DNA and NC concentrations, which are much higher in our
experiments.
When Zn2+ is removed from NC by EDTA treatment, pro-
tein binding results in essentially no effect on K-TBA stability
(Figure 4). These data reveal the important role of the Zn
fingers in quadruplex destabilization, and are in agreement
with earlier studies which showed that Zn finger mutations
decrease or abolish NC chaperone activities (32–37).
In contrast to results obtained with EDTA-treated NC, the
deletion of 10 amino acids from the N-terminus did not result
in a significant decrease in the destabilizing activity of NC
(Figure 4). This result supports the conclusion that destabil-
ization of TBA quadruplexes is induced primarily by the Zn
finger domains of NC. As expected based on previous studies
with NC lacking the N-terminal domain (38,39), we did not
observe any aggregation, even upon the addition of four equi-
valents of NC(11–55) per oligonucleotide. Moreover, as
shown in Figure 4, the addition of 4 NC(11–55) molecules
resulted in further destabilization of the TBA quadruplex.

DNA duplex. The CD profile of the DNA duplex shown in
Figure 1B, taken in 20 mM CsCl and 10 mM Cs–HEPES,
corresponds to the expected B-DNA secondary structure of
a guanine-rich duplex. The CD spectrum contains two positive
bands at 266 and 283 nm, and a negative band 240 nm
(Figure 5). In contrast to the result with TBA quadruplexes,
the addition of NC does not significantly affect the CD spec-
trum; we observed only a slight increase of the CD signal
upon the addition of one equivalent of NC and a slight
decrease after the addition of second equivalent (Figure 5).
The CD spectrum of a completely unfolded/melted duplex
(Figure 5, dashed line) clearly indicates that the small CD
effects observed upon NC binding do not correspond to any
measurable duplex unfolding. Similarly, no measurable effects
were observed in the case of NC(11–55), even at four proteins
per strand (data not shown). Thus, we observe dramatically
different effects of NC on the secondary structures of the DNA
molecules investigated here. Binding of two equivalents of NC
results in significant destabilization of monomolecular quad-
ruplexes, with essentially no influence on the secondary struc-
ture of the DNA duplex derived from the same sequence.
Salt concentration dependence. The CD studies discussed
above were performed under a variety of solution conditions.
All experiments with TBA contained 10 mM Cs–HEPES,
pH 7.5, whereas the duplex was studied in the presence of
20 mM CsCl. To fold TBA into a stable quadruplex, 50 mM
KCl or 10 mM SrCl2 were added. These salt concentrations
(i) ensured formation of the desired secondary structures at the
experimental temperature of 20C, (ii) allowed a comparison
of K-TBA and the DNA duplex under conditions of similar
thermal stability (Figure 7) and (iii) facilitated NC binding to
oligonucleotides (40,41). Binding is expected to be strong
under the low salt conditions, but becomes weaker in high salt.
To rule out the possibility that the different effects of NC on
the quadruplex and duplex structures were induced by differ-
ences in solution conditions, we performed CD studies of the
duplex in the presence of 50 mM KCl. However, NC did not
significantly affect the CD spectrum of K-TBA under these
conditions (Supplementary Material, Figure S2).

Non-specific electrostatic forces are major contributors to
NC–nucleic acid interactions (42). To determine whether NC–
quadruplex interactions are salt sensitive, we performed CD
studies of quadruplexNC complexes as a function of different
monovalent cations. Since certain cations favor TBA quad-
ruplex formation (e.g. K+, NH4
+ and Rb+) while others do not
(e.g. Li+, Na+ and Cs+) (9), increasing the cation concentration
in the former case not only contributes to the ionic strength but
also directly affects the secondary structure of TBA. Figure 6A
shows CD spectra of the TBA2NC as a function of KCl
concentration. The bold line corresponds to TBA2NC in
10 mM KCl; increasing the K+ concentration results in an
increase in the CD signal at all bands. Figure 6B shows the
dependence of the CD signal at 293 nm on KCl concentration.
At higher concentrations of KCl (i.e. 200 mM) the CD spec-
trum of the TBA2NC complex resembles the spectrum
obtained at low salt (i.e. 10 mM KCl) in the absence of NC
(Figure 6A and B, dashed lines). This result suggests that NC is
displaced from the quadruplex by high salt, similar to disso-
ciation from other single- and double-stranded nucleic acids.
This strong salt dependence of binding is a signature of the
important contribution of non-specific ionic interactions to
NC-TBA binding.
UV melting experiments
We next used optical melting techniques to characterize ther-
modynamic parameters of TBA and DNA duplex unfolding,
and to study the impact of NC on the unfolding process.
Quadruplexes. Figure 7A shows differential UV thermal
unfolding profiles of the K-TBA quadruplex in the absence
and in the presence of NC protein. As expected, K-TBA in
50 mM KCl melts at 50C (9). The transition peak is neg-
ative, owing to the hypochromic nature of quadruplex unfold-
ing at 300 nm (9,43). The unfolding is monophasic,
corresponding to a two-state transition. As in the case of
the CD measurements, UV thermal unfolding experiments
were performed in the presence of 1 and 2 NC molecules
per TBA strand. In the presence of NC, TBA is destabilized
and the melting transition spans the entire temperature range.
Owing to such broad melting transition, it was not possible to
determine accurately the Tm values in the presence of NC.
DNA duplex. The differential unfolding curve of the duplex in
20 mM CsCl, 10 mM Cs–HEPES buffer (Figure 7B, open
circles) is also characterized by a single sharp peak, corres-
ponding to a two-state transition. Adding one equivalent of NC
per strand does not induce any change in Tm value (Figure 7B

and Table 1). However, the presence of NC broadens the
transition, indicating a decrease in the transition enthalpy
(Table 1). In the presence of 2 NC proteins per strand, we
observe an4C decrease in Tm, and a further reduction in the
cooperativity of the helix–coil transition, resulting in a DHvH
value of 77 kcal/mol (Table 1). Thus, in contrast to the results
obtained with the quadruplexes, 1 NC per DNA strand does not
induce significant destabilization of the duplex, but the addi-
tion of 2 NC proteins per strand (i.e. 1 NC per 7–8 nt) slightly
destabilizes the structure. We also performed UV melting
experiments on the DNA duplex in the presence of
NC(11–55); results were almost identical to wild-type NC
(data not shown). Our melting studies are in general
agreement with previous studies on DNA duplexes of varying
length and sequence (44). The literature experiments showed
that 1 NC per 8 nt destabilizes 21mer and 28mer DNA
duplexes, while also broadening the melting transition.
ITC experiments
ITC is a sensitive tool to study biomolecular interactions and
can provide direct information on binding stoichiometry, affin-
ity and enthalpy. We have used ITC to study the influence of
NC on the folding of DNA quadruplexes and the DNA duplex
at constant temperature. In the case of quadruplexes, aliquots
of K+ or Sr2+ ions were injected into the Cs-TBA (unfolded
quadruplex) solution in the absence and in the presence of NC,
and the heat changes accompanying quadruplex formation and
TBA-cation binding were measured. Results of a typical
experiment are shown in Figure 8A. The apparent discontinu-
ity in peaks is due to an increase in volume of titrant during the
experiments. This allowed us to obtain binding isotherms with
evenly distributed experimental points (Figure 8B) and to
reliably estimate the binding parameters: number of binding
sites, n, binding constants, K, and enthalpy, DH. A simple
model, which assumes a single non-cooperative binding
site, accurately describes the experimental titration curves
(45). The solid line in Figure 8B is a result of nonlinear fitting
based on this model. The thermodynamic parameters obtained
from the fits are reported in Tables 2 and 3.
K-TBA. A binding stoichiometry of 3:1 K+ cations per quad-
ruplex was determined for solutions of TBA both alone and in
the presence of NC. Earlier NMR studies detected only two
potassium binding sites (46). The present stoichiometry of 3:1
is, however, in good agreement with earlier acoustic experi-
ments of TBA in the presence of K+ (9). As shown in Table 2,
NC binding results in a strong decrease in quadruplex forma-
tion enthalpy, which is reduced to 70% of the DH value
measured in the absence of NC. Addition of NC also results
in a 14.2 kcal/mol increase in TDS, which suggests that NC
entropically stabilizes quadruplex formation. Thus, NC-
induced enthalpic destabilization (15.2 kcal/mol) is almost
compensated by entropic stabilization, resulting in only

1 kcal/mol net reduction in overall free energy of folding
(Table 2). This result is in agreement with the NC-induced
decrease in melting enthalpy and increase in melting entropy
of both the TBA quadruplex and the DNA duplex observed in
the UV thermal unfolding studies.
Sr-TBA. Binding of Sr2+ ions to TBA reveals a stoichiometry
of 1:1 (Table 2), which agrees well with previous hydration (9)
and NMR (48) studies. As in the case of K-TBA, the presence
of NC does not affect binding stoichiometry, within experi-
mental error (Table 2). The enthalpy of Sr-TBA formation,
which is also in good agreement with an earlier determination
(9), is strongly affected by the presence of NC. Thus, NC
enthalpically destabilizes (by 9 kcal/mol) and entropically
stabilizes (by 7.9 kcal/mol) the Sr-TBA quadruplex, resulting
in a destabilization free energy of 1.1 kcal/mol, which is sim-
ilar to the value determined for K-TBA. The thermodynamic
data summarized in Table 2 reveal an enthalpically driven
destabilization of both quadruplexes upon NC binding.
Duplex. In the ITC studies carried out with the DNA duplex,
30 ml aliquots of TBA were added to the complementary DNA
strand, and the heat of duplex formation was measured. The
influence of NC on duplex formation was studied by incub-
ating equimolar amounts of NC with each oligonucleotide,
prior to mixing. A strand stoichiometry of 1:1 was measured
both in the absence and in the presence of NC (Table 3). The
enthalpy of duplex formation in 10 mM Cs–HEPES buffer is
64 kcal/mol, which is significantly smaller than the unfolding
value obtained from the UV melting experiments (Table 1). A
similar discrepancy between ITC and UV unfolding enthalpies
has been observed for other oligonucleotides (B. I. Kankia,
unpublished data) and can be explained by the different nature
of the experiments. In particular, thermal unfolding enthalpies
contain heats of unstacking of nucleic acid bases, which are
absent in ITC experiments. As in the case of TBA quadruplex
unfolding, the absolute values of the enthalpies and entropies
of duplex unfolding are significantly decreased in the presence
of NC, according to both our ITC and UV data. The molecular
basis for this phenomenon and its implication for the kinetics
of duplex opening/closing by NC, will be discussed in detail
elsewhere (I. Rouzina, manuscript in preparation).
ITC measurements performed at low ionic strength allow an
estimation of the affinity between complementary strands, as
well as of the free energy of duplex formation. As shown in
Figure 9 (upper curve), titration experiments in 10 mM Cs–
HEPES reveal gradually decreasing heats of reaction, which
allowed us to estimate a value of 9.1 kcal/mol for the free
energy of duplex formation in the absence of NC (Table 3). At
higher ionic strength (100 mM NaCl) the binding affinity
between complementary strands increases dramatically,
which results in the ITC titration profile shown in the middle
curve of Figure 9. Under these conditions, the affinity between
the complementary strands is too high to be estimated from
ITC (Table 3). However, the n and DH values determined
under these conditions are similar to the values determined
at low ionic strength (Table 3). The kinetics of duplex forma-
tion is highly dependent on solution ionic strength. At low
ionic strength, duplex formation is slow, with a waiting time of
10 min between each injection. At high ionic strength,
standard 3 min waiting periods were sufficient (Figure 9).
Interestingly, in the presence of NC at low ionic strength,
duplex formation is accelerated (Figure 9, bottom curve),
while binding affinity and the free energy of duplex formation
stay the same (Table 3).
CONCLUSIONS
As reported in Table 2, favorable free energies of folding for
both K-TBA and Sr-TBA quadruplexes result from the com-
pensation of a favorable folding enthalpy by an unfavorable
entropic term. Sr-TBA forms a significantly more stable quad-
ruplex than K-TBA (by 3 kcal/mol); its enthalpy of folding is
less favorable (by 7.3 kcal/mol), while its folding entropy is
more favorable (by 10.3 kcal/mol). Thus, the more favorable
folding DG of Sr-TBA is due to the entropic term. Based on the
similarity of the K-TBA and Sr-TBA structures (47), it is
reasonable to assume that hydrogen bonding and stacking
interactions contribute similarly to the thermodynamic para-
meters. Thus, differences in the stability of the two quad-
ruplexes may be explained by differences in ionic
interactions and hydration effects resulting from binding of
three K+ ions to K-TBA versus one Sr2+ cation to Sr-TBA (9).
In the presence of NC, quadruplex folding is destabilized
enthalpically and stabilized entropically relative to the NC-
free quadruplex systems. We observe a similar decrease
(15%) in the folding free energy for both quadruplexes as
a result of strong enthalpy–entropy compensation (Table 2).
This result agrees well with the established notion that the free
energy of folding is the result of a delicate balance between
mutually compensatory enthalpic and entropic terms (48–50).
The decrease in enthalpy of quadruplex folding, most likely,
comes from enthalpic stabilization of the unfolded DNA state
by NC. The latter effect is due to partial stacking of aromatic
residues, F16 and W37, within the zinc fingers of NC with
otherwise unstacked DNA bases (51).
Our UV data show that in the presence of NC, the melting
profile of TBA molecules is significantly altered, with the
transition becoming more uncooperative. In addition, both
ITC and CD analyses show that at 20C, NC effectively

unfolds and increases the disorder of the quadruplex system.
However, even at high NC concentrations, quadruplex unfold-
ing is incomplete, in accordance with the limited capability of
NC to melt nucleic acid secondary structures. The fact that we
only observe partial quadruplex unfolding in the presence of
NC does not imply that each quadruplex molecule is only
partially unfolded. Indeed, the presence of isosbestic points
in the CD spectra shown in Figure 2 provides evidence that NC
induces a two-state transition between the fully folded and the
fully unfolded quadruplex.
Taken together, ITC, UV melting and CD spectroscopy
studies reveal that NC destabilizes and unfolds quadruplexes.
The unfolding activity of NC does not require ATP and does
not, therefore, reflect G4-helicase activity. The slight prefer-
ence of NC for single-stranded nucleic acids is, in part,
responsible for its destabilizing activity (43). Experiments
with EDTA-treated NC and with truncated NC(11–55)
show clearly that this effect is due to the zinc finger structures.
Although a previous study showed that a zinc finger peptide
derived from the DNA-binding domain of Zif268 binds to a
quadruplex derived from the human telomeric sequence in a
structure-specific manner (52), the Zif268-like zinc finger
domains do not resemble the CCHC type retroviral zinc
knuckles of NC.
In contrast, under conditions where we observe NC-induced
quadruplex unfolding, the effect of NC on the related DNA
duplex is much less pronounced. A reasonable explanation for
the much weaker NC-induced DNA duplex versus quadruplex
destabilization is the higher overall free energy of duplex
melting by comparison to the DG of quadruplex melting
(Tables 2 and 3). While the duplex contains 15 bp, there
are only four base pairing interactions within the quadruplex.
Therefore, assuming that NC has a similar destabilization
effect per base pair on both DNA structures, the modest
destabilization by NC within the quadruplex results in a
major overall structural perturbation. In contrast, the same
destabilization activity of NC (per base pair) on the duplex
results in a very little change in duplex structure. This phe-
nomenon is similar to the previously observed negative
correlation between the destabilizing effect of NC and the
stability of transactivation response element-derived DNA
hairpins (53–55). As the stability of hairpin structures
increased, the capability of NC to destabilize these structures
decreased. We conclude, based on the recent work with DNA
quadruplexes reported here, that NC has the capability to
function as a relatively weak destabilizer of a variety of nuc-
leic acid secondary and tertiary structures. This conclusion is
in good agreement with NC’s function in the HIV-1 lifecycle
as a non-specific chaperone of a wide variety of nucleic acid
restructuring events (42).
