Abstract. We examine the sensitivity of a climate model to a wide range of radiative 
forcings, including changes ofsolar irradiance, atmospheric CO2, 03, CFCs, clouds, 
aerosols, urface •bedo, and a "ghost" forcing introduced at arbitrary heights, latitudes, 
longitudes, easons, and times of day. We show that, in general, the climate response, 
specifically the global mean temperature change, issensitive tothe altitude, latitude, 
and nature of the forcing; that is, the response to a given forcing can vary by 50% or 
more depending upon characteristics of the forcing other than its magnitude measured in
watts per square meter. The consistency of the response among different forcings is 
higher, within 20% or better, for most of the globally distributed forcings uspected of 
influencing global mean temperature in the past century, but exceptions occur for 
certain changes of ozone or absorbing aerosols, for which the climate response isless 
well behaved. In •1 cases the physic• basis for the variations of the response can be 
understood. The principal •nechanisms involve •terations of lapse rate and decrease 
(increase) oflarge-sc•e cloud cover in layers that are preferentially heated (cooled). 
Although the magnitude of these ffects must be model-dependent, the existence and 
sense of the mechanisms appear to be reasonable. Overall, we reaffirm the value of the 
radiative forcing concept for predicting climate response and for comparative studies of 
different forcings; indeed, the present results can help improve the accuracy of such 
an•yses and define error estimates. Our results also emphasize the need for 
measurexnents having the specificity and precision eeded to define poorly known 
forcings uch as absorbing aerosols and ozone change. Available data on aerosol single 
scatter •bedo ixnply that anthropogenic aerosols cause less cooling than has co•nmonly 
been asstuned. However, negative forcing due to the net ozone change since 1979 
appears tohave counterbalanced 30-50% of the positive forcing due to the increase of
well-xnixed greenhouse gases in the same period. As the net ozone change includes 
halogen- driven ozone depletion with negative radiative forcing and a tropospheric 
ozone increase with positive radiative forcing, it is possible that the h•ogen-driven 
ozone depletion has counterbalanced more than h•f of the radiative forcing due to well- 
xnixed greenhouse gases since 1979. 
1. Introduction 
Global climate is complicated by the si•nultaneous existence 
of many external forcing mechanis•ns, as well as internal 
feedback processes and unforced cli•nate variability. The 
Wonderland climate model, described by Hansen et al. [this 
issue] (hereinafter referred to as paper W1) is a three- 
dimensional general circulation •nodel (GCM) designed to allow 
efficient analysis of all these mechanis•ns of climate change. 
Here we use the Wonderland model to examine how well the 
radiative flux change at the tropopause serves as a predictor of

the cli•nate response to different radiative forcings. This topic is 
of practical relevance because ofthe need to assess the relative 
climate impact of different changing at•nospheric constituents. 
In the absence of information to the contrary, the Intergovern- 
mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [1990, 1994], World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) [1992], and researchers in 
general have been forced to use the assumption, implicitly if not 
explicitly, that climate change is proportional to radiative 
forcing. 
We described the control run of the Wonderland model with 
specified ocean temperatures in paper W1. Section 2 describes 
additional control runs, with computed sea surface temperatures, 
and we briefly examine how the unforced model variability is 
affected by fixing certain aspects ofthe model, such as the cloud 
cover. Section 3 shows the sensitivity of the model to the 
classical doubled CO 2 and 2% solar irradiance forcings. Section 
4 illustrates that the climate model response to ozone change 
violates the assumption f proportionality between forcing and 
response. Interpretation f the model response to any forcing is

aided by section 5, which shows the model sensitivity to arbitrary 
"ghost" forcings introduced at different places and times, and by 
section 6, which shows the model sensitivity to cloud changes at 
arbitrary levels. Section 7 examines the model sensitivity to 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) changes, including dependence on the 
assumed height profile of CFC in the stratosphere. Sections 8 
and 9 examine the model sensitivity to changes of aerosols and 
surface reflectivity. 
2. Control Runs 
The Wonderland model is a sector GCM with idealized 
geography covering 120 ø of longitude. The model physics and 
the resulting zonal mean climatology are nearly the same as the 
full GCM of Hansen et al. [1983]. The horizontal resolution is 
7.83 ø (latitude) by 10 ø (longitude). The nine vertical layers 
include one to two layers in the stratosphere. 
Control run 1, documented in paper W1, has specified sea 
surface temperatures. Run 1 is used to infer, from the assump- 
tion of energy conservation at each grid box, the horizontal 
transport of heat by the ocean, which is then used in all other 
control runs and in the sensitivity experiments with calculated 
ocean temperature. This •nethod of specifying ocean heat 
transports, defined by Russell et al. [ 1985] and used by Hansen 
et al. [1984], is sometimes called the "q flux" method. In the 
calculation of implied ocean transports, the ocean mixed layer 
has a seasonally varying depth based on climatology of the 
real-world grid boxes indicated in Figure 2 of paper W1. The 
global-mean annual-maximum mixed layer depth is 107 m. 
Control run 2, with calculated ocean mixed layer temperature, 
has a mean climate practically identical to that of run 1. 
However, the free ocean temperature allows greater interannual 
climate variability, as illustrated by the global mean surface air 
temperature in Figure 1. The standard deviation of the annual 
mean global temperature about the long-term mean is 0.13 øC for 
run 2, for both the 200-year period (Figure 1 a) and the 1000-year 
period (Figure lb). 
Control run 3 has diffusive mixing of temperature anomalies 
between the mixed layer and deeper ocean, with a stability 
dependent diffusion coefficient which varies from grid point to 
grid point as specified by Hansen et al. [ 1984]. The global ocean 
average of the diffusion coefficient (k) is 2.5 cm2/s (for either the 
whole ocean or the grid points employed in the Wonderland 
model), but the value of k required in a one-dimensional climate 
model [Hansen et al., 1984] for best fit to the global mean 
surface temperature response of the three-dimensional model is 
k • I cm2/s. Note (Figure 1) that the diffusive mixing with the 
deep ocean damps surface temperature variability, so that the 
standard deviation of the annual mean global surface air 
temperature is o = 0.08 øC for run 3. The standard deviation of 
temperature would return to larger values if the ocean dynamical 
heat transports also were computed. Manabe et al. [1990] find 
o = 0.1 øC with a coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM. Detrended

variability of climate forcings, yield o = 0.1-0.15 øC [Hansen and 
Lebedeff , 1987]. 
We use run 2, and its variants described below, as the control 
runs for experiments in this paper. This is because our interest 
here is the equilibrium climate response to various forcings, and 
the mixed layer ocean approaches equilibrium rapidly. Run 3 is 
the control for transient climate experiments, such as those 
reported by Hansen et al. [ 1993a]. 
In variants of run 2, such as those listed in Table 1, one or 
more quantities (clouds, sea ice, water vapor, tropospheric lapse 
rate, and ground temperature) are held fixed; that is, they are not 
allowed to vary from year to year. One purpose of these runs is 
tt• allow the influence of certain global climate feedbacks to be 
studied. We do not focus on feedback studies in this paper, but 
the variants of run 2 help reveal the relation between radiative 
forcing and climate response. The values of fixed quantities are 
those computed at each time step and grid point in a specific year 
(year 217) of control run 2. Thus the weather patterns in these 
runs are not necessarily consistent with the geographical 
distributions of the specified quantities. This inconsistency 
should not affect the general conclusions of interest to us here. 
The geographical distribution of year to year variability of 
surface air temperature is illustrated in Plate 1 for six control 
runs. Run 1 shows that there is very large interannual variability 
over high-latitude continental and sea ice regions even when the 
ocean temperature and sea ice cover are fixed. Run 2 reveals that 
allt•wing the mixed layer temperature to change increases the 
variability substantially over the ocean but only modestly 
increases variability over land. Run 3 shows that although the 
deep ocean heat capacity damps the variability of global mean 
temperature (Figure 1), it has practically no effect on the larger 
local variability. Thus it appears that at least with fixed ocean 
heat transport, the variability over land is mainly a result of 
fluctuating atmospheric dynamics. Although extraneous to the 
thesis of our present paper, this conclusion is discouraging for 
possible prediction of unforced interannual regional climate 
fluctuations. Of course, changing ocean transports, not included 
in the current model, may increase variability over land. For 
exmnple, long-term changes of the thermohaline circulation can 
alter the extent of continental ice sheets, and E1 Nino events 
contribute to short-term variability. However, comparison with 
observed variability [Hansen et al., 1996, also manuscript in 
preparation, 1997] suggests that unforced atmospheric 
fluctuations account for the larger part of interannual to decadal 
variability at most latitudes. 
Comparison of runs 2, 2c, 2i, and 2ci reveals a positive 
interaction among feedback processes which increases the 
variability, especially an interaction between the clouds and sea 
ice in the region of southern hemisphere sea ice. This positive 
interaction, or feedback, between these two feedbacks also 
increases the regional and global climate sensitivity, as we show 
below. We do not know whether this interaction is realistically 
portrayed in the current model. Because cloud feedbacks are 
particularly uncertain, we make extensive use of the model with

3. CO 2 and Solar Irradiance Experiments 
We lb'st discuss radiative forcings in general (section 3.1)and 
the 2xC(): and spectrally uniform +2% S O forcings in particular 
(section 3.2). We then examine the climate model response to 
these tw• idealized fi•rcings (section 3.3), and the model 
resp•mse to spectrally and temp{•rally varying fi•rcings related to 
the solar cycle (section 3.4). 
3.1. Radiative Forcing Discussion 
A radiative forcing is a change imposed on the planetary 
radiation balance. It is measured by the net radiative flux 
change, at some level in the atmosphere, calculated to occur in 
response to the perturbation, which may be a change of incident 
solar radiation, atmospheric composition, or planetary surface 
pr(•perties, for example. Several quantitative definitions of 
radiative forcing are in use, their differences depending upon the 
atmospheric level at which the flux change is computed and upon 
whether the stratospheric temperature profile is allowed to adjust 
tt• the perturbation. 
The simplest useful definition of radiative forcing is the 
instantaneous flux change at the tropopause. This is easy to 
compute because it does not require iterations. This forcing is 
called "m•de A" by WMO [1992]. We refer to this forcing as the 
"instantaneous forcing", F,, using the nomenclature of Hansen et 
al. [1993c]. In a less meaningful alternative, F• is computed at 
the top of the atmosphere; we include calculations of this 
alternative for 2xC() 2 and +2% S O for the sake of comparison 
(Table 2). 
An improved measure of radiative forcing is obtained by 
allowing the stratospheric temperature to adjust to the presence 
•f the nert•rber i• a radialive eouilibrium r•rofile. with the 
ß , ß ß 
tropospheric temperature held fixed. This forcing is called 
"mode B" by WMO [1992]; we refer to it here as the "adjusted 
forcing", F• [Hansen et al., 1993c]. The rationale for using the 
adjusted forcing is that the radiative relaxation time of the 
stratosphere is only several months [Manabe and Strickler, 
19(34], compared to several decades for the troposphere [Hansen

• The instantaneous flux changes are shown at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the tropopause, with the latter value being the more meamngful 
climate forcing. 
HANSEN ET AL.: RADIATIVE FORCING AND CLIMATE RESPONSE 6835 
et al., 1985], and thus the adjusted forcing should be a better 
measure of the expected climate response for forcings which are 
present at least several months. This expectation tends to be 
borne out by our Wonderland simulations. 
The adjusted forcing can be calculated at the top of the 
atmosphere because the net radiative flux is constant hroughout 
the stratosphere in radiative equilibrium. The calculated F a 
depends on where the tropopause l vel is specified. We specify 
this level as 100 mbar from the equator to 40 ø latitude, changing 
to 189 mbar there, and then increasing linearly to 300 mbar at the 
poles. We calculate flux changes twice, letting the fixed lapse 
rate region extend to the discrete GCM levels just below and just 
above this specified tropopause level, and then interpolate to 
obtain F a at this specified level. Although the specified 
tropopause l vel is somewhat arbitrary, we have verified that the 
conclusions in this paper are not altered qualitatively by the 
precise level selected. 
We anticipate that investigators will continue to use different 
choices for the radiative forcing (instantaneous or adjusted) and 
the level at which it is calculated. Thus we provide values for 
alternative choices, which may aid comparisons among different 
investigators provided that they define their choice of forcing and 
ahnospheric level. However, we caution that quantitative 
variations in computed forcings will also be caused by differing 
approxi•nations in radiative calculations, differing methods of 
averaging in l-D, 2-D, and 3-D •nodels, and other such factors. 
Finally, the cartoons in Figure 2 illustrate the differences 
among the instantaneous forcing (Fi) , the adjusted forcing (Fa) ,
the no-feedback surface temperature response (AT0) , and the 
equilibrium response (ATe). It is apparent that one might 
anticipate F, and AT 0 to differ only by a scale factor, and indeed, 
we usually find AT0(øC) - 0.3 F a(w/m2). IPCC [ 1994] takes this 
empirical proportionality between F a and AT 0 as an indication 
that Fa is an adequate measure of the expected climate response. 
However, F a and AT 0 are simply different expressions of the 
same physical assumption, specifically, that the lapse rate in the 
troposphere is fixed and the lapse rate in the stratosphere is
determined by radiative equilibrium. The real issue is whether 
ATe, the surface temperature change, is proportional to F, when 
the tropospheric lapse rate is allowed to change in response to 
climate feedbacks including cloud changes (Figure 2d). 
3.2. The 2xCO 2 and Spectrally Uniform +2% S o Forcings 
The 2xCO 2 and +2% S O forcings are used in Figure 3, in an 
elaboration f a cartoon used to illustrate the Earth's greenhouse 
effect and the expected radiative-convective response tothese 
two forcings [Hansen et al., 1993a]. The Earth absorbs about 
240 W/m 2 of solar energy and, on average, must radiate that 
amount ofthermal energy back to space. The effective radiating 
temperature required to yield that outgoing flux is 255øK 
(-18øC), which is the temperature at the mean level of emission 
to space at about 6 km altitude. The mean tropospheric 
temperature gradient is about 5.5øC/km, so the surface 
temperature is about 33øC warmer than it would be if the 
atmosphere w re transparent (and the planetary albedo were still 
0.3). 
If solar irradiance increases 2% (at all wavelengths), the 
instantaneous flux change at the top of the atmosphere is 4.7 
W/m 2. However, a fraction of this energy is absorbed in the 
stratosphere, which is not well coupled by at•nospheric motions 
to the troposphere, so much of the stratospherically absorbed 
solar radiation is radiated back to space without affecting the 
surface te•nperature. Thus the instantaneous flux change at the 
tropopause, which is about 4.4 W/m 2, is a better •neasure of the 
forcing of surface t mperature. The adjusted forcing, Table 2, is 
close in value to the instantaneous forcing at the tropopause, 
because the stratospheric temperature change is s•nall. In order 
for the planet o radiate 4.5 W/m 2 more energy back to space, 
thus restoring energy balance, the surface would need to warm 
about 1.3øC (AT0) if the atmospheric temperature gradient and 
all other factors were fixed. 
If the amount of CO 2 in the air is doubled, the atmosphere 
beco•nes •nore opaque, te•nporarily reducing thermal emission to 
space. The instantaneous flux change at the tropopause is about 
4.7 W/m 2, but the flux change at the top of the atmosphere is 
only about 2.6 W/m 2, because the added C() 2 helps the 
stratosphere radiate to space more efficiently. The flux change 
at the tropopause is more relevant o the expected surface 
te•nperature change, as shown by co•nparison to the adjusted 
forcing, which is about 4.2 W/m 2. Thus the 2xCO 2forcing is 
ahnost as large as for +2% So, and in both cases the expected

The assumption that the climate forcing and response are 
proportional is a useful approximation, which for practical 
considerations •nust be widely used, but for this reason it is 
i•nportant to have a good understanding of its basis and to 
determine whether there are situations where inaccuracies are

We rcc()nsider the 2xC() 2 anti (spectrally uniform) 2% solar 
irradiance fi)rcings, thus calibrating the climate sensitivity of our 
present m{•del and providing a precise comparison of the 
different definitions of radiative forcing. Our control runs have 
solar irradiance 1368 W/m 2, planetary albedo 32%, and absorbed 
s{•lar energy about 233 W/m 2. The instantaneous forcing at the 
t½•p •f the atmosphere is thus ab{)ut 4.66 W/m 2 for a 2% solar 
irradiance change. The control runs have a C() 2 amount of 285 
ppm, appr{•priate for 1850. The accuracy of the radiative transfer 
calculations for C() 2 change has been tested by comparison with 
line-by-line calculations [Cess et al., 1993]' the GCM 
parameterization was found to yield a forcing about 5% less than 
the line-by-line results, probably because of the omission of 
s{m•e weak lines in the GCM calculationso 
We note that the climate sensitivity of the Wonderland model 
is s{m•ewhat less than that of the parent m{)del II [Hansen et at., 
19831, which had a gl½•bal mean surface air warming t•f 4.2øC fi•r 
2xC() 2 IHansen et al., 1984]. This is because of the small 
alteration in gl{)bal clcmd feedbacks (appendix of paper W1) 
which results in a more moderate net positive cloud feedback. 
We note also that the model's sensitivity is higher in the direction 
of c{dder climates; this characteristic, in common with other 
m{•dels and presumably with the real world, arises because of the 
larger sea ice feedback in the colder climate. 
Plates 2 and 3 and Table 2 summarize the instantaneous 
f(•rcing, adjusted forcing, and equilibrium response ()f the 
W•mderland mt•dcl fo• the 2xC() 2 and 2% S O experin•ents. The 
cquihbrium resp{)nsc is sh½)wn for b()th the fixed cloud and 
standard (all feedbacks)•n½•dels. In Table 2 we include results 
for decreased sol• irradiance (-2% So) to illustrate quantitatively 
the higher climate sensitivity t•ward c{•lder climates. This 
variation ½}f sensitivity with the mean climate state should be 
b•)rne in mind when c()mparing the resp()nses for forcings ()f 
different magnitudes and/()r forcings of opp()site sign. 
The z()nal mean radiative forcings and equilibrium responses 
arc summarized in Figure 4. It can be seen that for CO 2 and S O 
fi)rcings the trop()spheric temperature change is reasonably 
c•}nstant with altitude, consistent with the fixed lapse rate 
assumpti()n used in rot)st ]adiative-convective climate models. 
The responses tothese c()mparable global fi-•rcings, 2xCO 2 and 
+2% S 0, are similar in a gr()ss sense, as found by previous 
investig2t,_-:s. H,,we•,er, as w,• qhc•w in the qectic•nq helow, the 
sinfilarity {•f the responses is partly accidental, a cancellation of 
tw{) c{•ntrary effects. We show in section 5 that the climate 
model (and presumably the real world) is much more sensitive to 
a fi}rcing at high latitudes than to a forcing at low latitudes; this 
tends to cause a greater esponse for 2xCO 2 (compare Figures 4c 
and 4g); but the model is also more sensitive to a forcing that 
acts at the surface and lower troposphere than to a forcing which 
acts higher in the troposphere; this favors the solar forcing 
(c{m•pare Figures 4a and 4e), partially offsetting the latitudinal 
sensitivity. 
It is useful to define a nmnber •neasuring the effectiveness of 
any cli•nate ibrcing ibr altering surface temperature. We take the 
climate sensitivity to a spectrally uniform change of solar 
irradiance (perhaps the simplest global climate forcing) as a 
stand•d for comparison. That is, for an arbitrary forcing, define

calculated clouds. Thus, although there is partial cancellation of 
two effects discussed above, the greater high-latitude forcing by 
CO 2 is the larger effect and yields a greater global mean

response. The greater sensitivity to C(I) 2 with calculated clouds 
is largely a result (ff the positive interaction between sea ice 
changes and cloud changes, which is eliminated with fixed 
clouds. Although we suspect that the positive interaction 
between sea ice and cloud changes in our calculated cloud model 
is excessive, we cannot determine which model version is more 
realistic. Nevertheless, these results illustrate the absence of 
exact equivalency of different forcings, even for S o and CO 2 
changes. 
3.4. Climate Forcings Related to Solar Cycle 
In this section we consider temporally varying and spectrally 
varying changes of S 0. Plate 4 shows the amplitude of the 
surface air temperature response for sinusoidally varying solar 
irradiance of period 10 years and amplitude AS 0 = 1% (range AS 0 
= 2%). These ,are obtained as the average of the last twenty 
1 ()-year periods in 250-year runs of the Wonderland model. 
The response to an approximately 10-year periodic forcing has 
relevance to the real world, as evidence of a solar cycle signal 
has been detected in surface air temperatures [Currie, 1981; 
Stevens and North, 1996]. In principle, if the amplitude of AS 0 
were known, climate sensitivity could be inferred from measured 
changes of surface air temperature, but the mean amplitude of 
0.37-0.39øC (about twice that much in some land regions) in 
Plate 4 corresponds to only about 0.01 øC (0.02øC in some land 
regions) for the 0.05% mean range of solar cycle variability 
assumed by Stevens and North [1996] for the past century. 
Comprehensive analysis of the implications for climate 
sensitivity of calculated climate variations over the solar cycle is

beyond the scope of this paper. However, two conclusions are 
apparent from Plate 4. 
First, the amplitude of the surface air temperature response to 
the climate forcing is affected little by mixing of the heat 
perturbation into the deep ocean, specifically the global mean 
amplitude of the AT s response is reduced from 0.388øC to 
0.381øC by inclusion of the full ocean in the model. By itself, 
this result would be encouraging for empirical studies of climate 
sensitivity, because it implies that it is only necessary that the

caution that this conclusion is based on an ocean inodel which 
crudely represents heat perturbations as a passive diffusive

after large volcanoes [Hansen et al., 1996] suggests hat this 
approximation may understate the rate of heat exchange with the 
deeper ocean, which means that the actual response tothe solar 
cycle may be damped even somewhat more than in the present

with the relation between climate sensitivity and the response 
time to a forcing [Hansen et al., 1985], which shows that 10 
years is short compared to the equilibrium response time. We

conclude that it will not be possible to infer climate sensitivity 
from observed response to a small forcing with such a short 
period. At best, a measured response to solar irradiance 
variability can be used to set a lower limit on climate sensitivity 
but probably not a practically useful limit. 
Comprehensive study of the relation between solar variability 
and climate sensitivity would need to account more realistically 
for the climate forcing change over the solar cycle. One reason 
that the actual climate forcing is different than in the above 
idealized experiment is that solar cycle irradiance variations are 
not spectrally uniform. The range of total (spectrally integrated) 
solar irradiance is about 0.08% for the most recent complete 
solar cycle, based on smoothed data of the Active Cavity 
Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) instruments [Willson 
and Hudson, 1991; Lean, 1991; Willson, 1994]. However, the 
range of variability varies strongly with wavelength; J. Lean 
(private communication, 1995) has provided data indicating that 
the smoothed range of variability is about 1%, 0.3%, and 0.07% 
for the spectral intervals less than 0.295 lum, between 0.295 and 
0.31 lum, and greater than 0.31 lum, respectively. For a typical 
zenith angle, solar radiation in these three intervals is absorbed 
above layer 9 (i.e., above the 10 mbar level), within layer 9 
(between 10 and 70 mbar), and beneath layer 9. As these three 
spectral intervals contain about 0.95%, 0.65%, and 98.4% of the 
solar irradiance, the proportions of the solar variability 
associated with the three intervals are about 12%, 2%, and 86%, 
with the intervals in order of increasing wavelength. Because 
radiation in the first two intervals is absorbed well above the 
tropopause while that in the third interval is absorbed mainly at 
the surface and in the troposphere, the direct climate forcing 
associated with the solar cycle is approximately 233 W/m 2 x 
0.08% x 86% = 0.16 W/m 2. 
In addition to this direct solar irradiance forcing, there may be 
other real-world climate forcings associated with the solar cycle. 
()ne of these which can be investigated quantitatively is change 
of ozone amount. The range of solar cycle variation of ozone 
amount isabout 5DU (Dobson unit = 2.69x10 •6 molecules cm -2) 
of ozone in global mean (S. M. Hollandsworth, private 
communication, 1995), most of the change occurring in our 
[nodel layers 8 and 9 (between 10 and 150 mbar). In the 
following section we show how the ozone climate forcing varies 
with the altitude, latitude and season of the ozone change. For 
the solar cycle ozone variations of Hollandsworth, these 
calculations yield a range for the solar cycle ozone forcing of 
6842 HANSEN ET AL.: RADIATIVE FORCING AND CLIMATE RESP()NSE 
{•nly about F a = 0.05 W/m 2, which is in phase with the forcing 
due t{• the solar irradiance change. Thus the solar cycle oz{•ne 
forcing is about a factor 3 smaller than the direct solar cycle 
irradiance forcing. 
There may be larger ozone changes associated with solar 
variability on l•nger timescales. Lean et al. [1995] estimate that 
ozone may have been reduced 4% (about 12 DU) during the 
Maunder Minimum, but even this larger ozone reduction yields 
a fi•rcing only about Fa: 0.1 W/m 2 and an equilibrium surface 
temperature change ab(•ut 0.1 øC. These results suggest that 
t•zone change resulting fr{m• stdar variability probably is not a 
substantial contributor to surface climate variability and that the 
solar-related ozone climate forcing is several times smaller than 
the direct effect of changing solar irradiance. 
The net solar cycle fi•rcing that we have estimated, due to 
solar irradiance plus (•zone changes, is aboot 0.2 W/m 2. The 
fi•rcing w(•uld be somewhat larger if the solar irradiance 
measured by Nimbus 7 during its first year of operation is taken 
literally [ttickey e! al., 1988]; these latter data suggest a s(•lar 
cycle total irradiance variability close to 0.1%, compared to the 
0.08% based on ACRIM data alone. 
4. ()zone Experiments 
The ozone distribution in the control runs for our equilibrium 
change experiments is shown in Figure 5. Figures 5a and 5b 
show the ozone amount as a function of height, latitude, and 
season, while Figures 5c and 5d show the (•zone distribution 
among the 12 layers in our GCM. The global-mean annual-mean 
oz•ne amount is 0.306 cm arm or 306 Dobson units (DU). The 
ozone distributit•n [McPeters, 1993] is representative of 
measurements fi•r the 1979-1980 period. 
4.1. Four Extreme ()zone Perturbations 
We first consider four extreme ozone perturbations, using the 
standard versi(•n of the Wonderland model (i.e., calculated 
clouds or "all feedbacks") to obtain the equilibrium climate 
response, analogous to the C() 2 and S O experiments. Results are 
sh(•wn in Plate 5. 
In the first experiment the ozone above the 10 mbar level, 
19% of total (•zone (Figure 5), is removed. The principal effect 
is to shift solar ultraviolet heating into the lower atmosphere. 
The t•zone l(•ss als(• reduces greenhouse warming, but the effect 
surface. This contraslx•, with the CO 2 and S o forcings, for which 
the responses were reasonably uniform through the troposphere. 
The stratosphere warms in this experiment, because the intensity 
t•f radiation upwelling to the stratosphere is increased in the 
•zone inh'ared band. 
In the fourth experiment, all ozone is removed froin the 
atmosphere. The stratt•sphere cools by as much as -80øC, but at 
the surface the change is a cooling of less than 1 øC, the impacts 
t•f increased solar heating and decreased greenhouse effect 
c(fincidentally canceling t(• first order. Because this experiment 
is so extreme, we also consider a case with (-)3 reduced by half at 
all levels (Table 3). 
These ozone experiments, including the calculated F,, F, and 
AT• for the fixed clouds version of the model, are summarized in 
Figure 6 and Table 3. The results illustrate that climate response 
does nt•t have a fixed proportionality to the forcing. In one case 
(removal of all ozone) the surface temperature response is not 
even of the same sign as the instantaneous flux change at the 
tropopause. The adjusted fi•rcing is a much better indicator of 
the equilibrium response, although the ratio of response to 
forcing, R, varies by more than a factor of two and it depends 
substantially on how the clouds are handled. 
Quantitative interpretation of these results requires a 
systematic study of the dependence of the surface temperature 
change on the location of the ozone change, which we carry out 
in sectiron 4.2, but understanding of these results requires in turn 
that we exmnine a simpler, more general forcing (section 5) and 
that we quantify specifically the influence of cloud changes 
(section 6). 
4.2. ()zone Sensitivity Profile 
We carry out a set of GCM runs with ozone added to each 
m(,del layer individually, the control run being run 2 (mixed 
layer ocean). The mean over the last 50 years of each 100-year 
run is taken as the new equilibrium. The amount of ozone added 
to a layer is large (100 DU) because we want the calculated 
surface temperature change to be large coinpared to the unforced 
variability in the model. As a result, it is not obvious that the 
response for smaller perturbations necessarily would scale 
linearly in ozone amount. Therefore we reran two cases using a 
50 DU oz(,ne change, finding that the response was 
approximately linear in ozone amountø Figure 7 and Table 3 
temperature {•f the middle and upper stratosphere. Thus the 
result is a large m•pospheric warming (1-3øC) and a very large 
strat•spheric cooling (up to -80øC). 
In the second experiment tropospheric ozone is increased, 
specifically ozone below the 400 mbar level is doubled, yielding 
a 5.5% increase of total ozone. The principal effect is a 
greenhouse warming of the troposphere by about 0.5øC. The 
stratosphere cools, a few tenths of a degree, as the radiation from 
the troposphere to the stratosphere in the ozone infrared band 
arises from a higher colder level due to the increased opacity. 
In the third experiment ozone in the tr{•popause region is 
removed, specifically, all ozone is removed from m{•del layers 7 
and 8, which extend from 255 mbar to 70 mbar and contain 16% 
of the t•tal ozone. Because of the low temperature at this level, 
ozone is most effective there as a greenhouse material. Thus this 
ozone change causes atropospheric ooling, which reaches -4 øC 
near the tropopause and is about -IøC at the surface. This 
represents a substantial change of tropospheric lapse rate; only 
a fi'acthm of the upper m•pospheric cooling is transmitted to the 
cloud version. 
Figure 7a shows ATs, the equilibrium surface temperature 
change, and AT0, the calculated surface air temperature change 
if no climate feedbacks are allowed to operate, as a function of 
the altitude at which ozone is changed. The AT 0 profile can be 
compared with that calculated by Lacis et al. [1990] with a 1-D 
radiative-convective model. The present result for AT 0 versus 
height is less sharply peaked. with the maximum sensitivity 
occurring at a lower altitude (= 9 kin, model layer 6). This is 
because in our GCM layers 6-8 are in the stratosphere for much 
•)f the w{)rld, where the ozone change has less impact on the 
surface, while in the 1-D model the tropopause is at a sharply 
defined height Oust above 12 kin). 
The principal new result here is the GCM calculation of ATe. 
With clouds fixed, the dependence of AT• on the altitude of the 
ozone change (Figure 7a) is qualitatively similar to that of AT 0 
(or F•, since AT 0 - 0.3 F•). However, even in this case, AT• is not 
simply proporti{)nal t{• Fa, and when clouds are free to change, 
the relation between AT s and F• becomes complex, i.e., the

climate response is far frown being proportional to the cli•nate 
forcing. The dependence ofcli•nate sensitivity on the location of 
the ozt)ne change is illustrated •nore clearly by the feedback 
factor, ATs/AT o. The feedback factor depends strongly on the 
altitude of the 0 3 change (Figure 7b), especially if cloud cover is 
co•nputed. 
The •nost remarkable result is the paradoxic surface cooling 
that results from ozone added to the lowest atmospheric layer 
(Figure 7). This is not a consequence of the large value of the 
ozone forcing (100 DU), as we verified by using a change half as 
large. We conclude that negative feedbacks can change the sign 
of the surface temperature response in a GCM, as will be 
discussed in section 6. Although this conclusion •nay be 
counter-intuitive, such intuition derives from 1-D radiative- 
convective models which suffer from the constraint of a specified 
tropospheric lapse rate. Such a constraint applies neither to a 
GCM nor to the real world. 
Another conclusion is that the profile of the sensitivity (of 
surface te•nperature) as a function of the height of ozone change 
is broadened by physical processes represented in a GCM. Thus 
the climate sensitivity to ozone change in the middle troposphere 
and in the lower stratosphere is larger than would be inferred 
frown a 1-D or 2-D radiative-convective model. Previously, on 
the basis of calculations ofAT 0 versus height [Lacis et al., 1990], 
it has been realized that ozone change near the tropopause is an 
i•nportant climate forcing, but, as shown by Figure 7a, when 
climate feedbacks are included, the relative importance of 
trt•pospheric ozone change is enhanced, as is the importance of 
ozone changes just above the tropopause. 
An approach to quantitative interpretation of the climate 
response to ozone change is suggested by Figure 7. First, we 
should analyze how the cli•nate response depends upon location 
of the forcing in the absence of cloud changes, and, second, we 
should isolate and analyze the role of cloud changes. These tasks 
are carried out in the following two sections. 
5. Ghost Forcing Experiments 
How does the cli•nate response depend upon the time and 
place at which a forcing is applied? The forcings considered 
above all have complex te•nporal and spatial variations. For 
example, the change of solar irradiance varies with time of day, 
season, latitude, and even with longitude because of zonal 
variations in ground albedo and cloud cover. We would like a 
simpler test forcing. 
We define a "ghost" forcing as an arbitrary heating added to 
the radiative source term in the energy equation [Hansen et al., 
1983, Table 1]. The forcing in effect appears magically from 
outer space at any chosen atmospheric level, latitude range, 
season, and ti•ne of day. Usually, we choose a ghost forcing with 
global and annual •nean 4 W/m 2, •naking it comparable to the 
2xC(-) 2 and +2% S O experiments.

5.1. Dependence on Spatial Distribution of Forcing 
Height sensitivity. In the first ghost experiments we add 4 
W/m 2 into a model layer uniformly over the globe. The 
instantaneous forcing F,, by definition, is 4 W/m 2 if the ghost 
forcing is added to a layer lying in the troposphere, zero if the 
layer is in the stratosphere, and between zero and 4 W/m 2 if the 
layer lies partly in the troposphere and partly in the stratosphere 
(Table 4). The adjusted forcing F, is similar to F, for ghost 
heating added in the troposphere (Table 4), but ghost heating in 
the stratosphere yields a substantial adjusted forcing, which is a 
consequence of the increased stratospheric temperature and the 
resulting infrared flux across the tropopause. Because the 
infYared opacity in the stratosphere issmall at most wavelengths, 
it is not surprising that the adjusted forcing is about half of the 
heating added t(• the stratosphere (Table 4).

6846 HANSEN ET AL.' RADIATIVE F()RCING AND CLIMATE RESP()NSE 
The surface temperature change as a function of the altitude 
()f the 4 W/m: ghost forcing is shown in Figure 8. The profile ()f 
AT 0, the temperature change in the absence of feedbacks, is 
simply a reflection of F•, to which AT 0 is approximately 
pr()portional. ()ur main result is ATs, the GCM calculated 
surface temperature change when feedbacks are allowed to 
operateø We show both ATs itself and the feedback factor, 
AT•/AT o. and we include results for the standard model and the 
model with fixed clouds. 
We m)te that the feedback factor for the ghost forcing varies 
with the altitude of the forcing by about a factor of two. We also 
m)te that a substantial surface temperature resp•)nse is obtained 
even when the forcing is located entirely within the stratosphere. 
Analysis of these results requires that we first quantify the effect 
of cloud changes (section 6). However, the results can be 
understt)od qualitatively as follows. 
Consider AT• in the case of fixed clouds. As the forcing is 
added to successively higher layers, there are two principal 
competing effects. First, as the heating mt)ves higher, a larger 
fractitm ()f the energy is radiated directly to space without 
warming the surface, causing AT s to tend to decline as the 
altitude of the forcing increasesø However, second, warming of 
a given level alh)ws mr)re water vapor to exist there, and at the 
higher levels water vapor is a particularly effective greenhouse 
gas. The net result is that AT• tends to decline with the altitude 
t•f the fi)rcing, but it has a relative maximum near the trt)p(•pauseo 
When chmds are free tt) change, the surface temperature 
change depends even more on the altitude of the forcing (Figure 
8). The principal mechanism is that heating of a given layer 
tends tt• decrease large-scale cloud cover within that layer. The 
dt•minant effect t)f decreased lt)w level chmds is a reduced 
planetary albedt), thus a war•ning, while the dominant effect of 
decreased high chmds is a reduced greenhouse ffect, thus a 
ct)oling. However, the cloud cover, the cloud cover changes, and 
the surface temperature sensitivity tt) changes may depend on 
characteristics of the fi)rcing t)ther than altitude, e.g., latitude, so 
quantitative valuatitm requires detailed examination of the cloud 
changes (sectitm 6). 
We conclude that the resp(msivity R to a globally uniform 
ght•st fi•rcing varies by ab(mt a factt)r of 2 with the altitude ()f the 
forcing (Table 4). Also, if the fi•rcing is distributed unift)nnly 
thrt)ugh the tr()pt)sphere, the ghost fi)rcing is about as effective 
as a st4ar i•Tadiance forcing tff the same magnitude (Table 4). 
Latitude sensitivity. A limited examinatit)n of the climate 
sensitivity to the latitude t)f the forcing is included in Table 4. 
Specifically, we ctmqpared cases in which ghost forcing was 
added in the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere, 
latitudes equatt)rward ()f 30 ø, and latitudes poleward t)f 30 ø. In 
each case, a heating of 8 W/m 2 was added at the surface, yielding 
a global mean instantaneous forcing F, = 4 W/m 2. 
The difference of climate sensitivity between hemispheres in 
our model is moderate, the northern hemisphere being more 
sensitive with cltmds fixed and the southern hemisphere being 
more sensitive with calculated clouds. The latter result occurs 
because of the positive interaction between calculated clouds and 
sea ice cover in this GCM, which is most significant in the 
southern hemisphere. In addition to the uncertainty in the 
modeling of sea ice/cloud interactions, it should be noted that the 
present equilibrium mixed layer ocean calculations are most 
relevant to the century timescale. ()n shorter timescales the 
thermal inertia of the (•cean prt•bably reduces the transient 
response more in the st)uthern hemisphere than in the northern 
hemisphere. ()n palcoclimate timescales the crucial ice sheet 
feedback p•(•cess is expected to be larger in the northern 
hemisphere, which also increases the expected response relative 
to that in the southern hemisphere. 
A forcing at high latitudes yields a larger response than a 
forcing at low latitudes. This is expected because of the sea ice 
feedback at high latitudes and the more stable lapse rate at high 
latitudes. the latter tending to ct•nfine the thermal response to 
low levels. The largest latitudinal variatit)ns occur with calcu- 
lated cl()uds. These results are examined in section 6. 
5.2. Dependence on Temporal Variation of Forcing 
Seasonal sensitivity. Seasonally dependent forcing presents 
a curious case, revealing a foible of AT 0. In four experi•nents 
(Table 4) we applied a 16 W/m 2 forcing at the surface each 
season in the appropriate he•nisphere, st) that the global-mean 
annual-mean forcing was 4 W/m:. The equilibriu•n resp(mse of 
AT• is rather insensitive to the season, being largest in winter and 
s•nallest in sure,net. This is not surprising, given the larger 
sensitivity of a ctdder climate and its more stable lapse rates. 
The curious aspect is that AT 0 has a strong seasonal 
dependence and is not prt)pt)rtional to F,. Results of the AT 0 
calculation are shown in Figure 9 fi)r the extreme cases of 
summer and winter fi)rcings. These can be understood from the

response time of the mixed layer ocean (several years, given the 
absence of feedbacks), the radiative relaxation time of the 
atmosphere (several months), and the fact that the summer 
troposphere contains more water vapor than the winter 
tr(•posphere. The greater water vapor in the summer, with its 
more effective greenhouse trapping, causes the increase of T o to 
be larger in the three m{•nths of summer heating. The magnitude 
of the thermal relaxation in the 9 months following the heating 
is not sensitive to the season when the heating occurred. so the 
annual mean of AT 0 is higher in the case of summer forcing. In 
the GCM calculation of ATs, the water vapor, lapse rate, sea ice, 
atm{)spheric dynamics, and other feedbacks operate, spreading 
the impacts of forcings spatially and temporally. It turns out that 
the equilibrium ATs responds most to the winter forcing, despite 
the smaller value of AT0, for qualitative reasons mentioned 
above. Neither F,• nor AT 0 is a useful predictor of seasonal 
climate sensitivity, but F•, being insensitive to seasonal change, 
is less deceptive than AT 0. 
Seasonally dependent forcing is inore than a curiosity. 
Although there is little dependence of the climate response on 
seasonality of ghost forcings at the surface, other cases are more 
sensitive. The modeled climate response to ozone depletion 
exhibits some dependence or, the seasons of depletion (Table 3). 
Even more dramatic dependc,•ce on the season of forcing occurs 
in paleoclimate simulations (not illustrated here). (We carried 
out a large number of simulations with different earth orbital 
(Milankovitch) parameters, with the intention of including them 
as a final section in this paper. The calculations are particularly 
relevant o the thesis of this paper, because, about as often as not 
the calculated global mean AT• has the opposite sign of F,•. 
However, the number of calculations and complexity of this case 
is so great that it seems better pursued as a separate study.) 
Diurnal sensitivity. The model response is not sensitive to 
the diurnal character of the forcing, judging from the test case in 
Table 4. In this case a forcing of 8 W/m 2 was added to layer 1 
either in the day or at night, with little difference in the response 
coinpared to a uniform 4 W/m 2. Presumably, this is a 
consequence of the radiative relaxation time being significantly 
longer than a day. 
6. Cloud Forcing Experiments 
We want to understand how the climate responds to a 
specified change of cloud cover or cloud properties for two 
reasons. First, imposed cloud changes, for example, those 
caused by anthropogenic aerosols, are a climate forcing that 
should be coinpared to other forcings. Second, cloud changes 
that occur in response to climate change are a key feedback that 
we need to an alyze. 
6.1. GCM Response to Specified Cloud Cover Changes 
The spatial distribution of clouds in the GCM control run is 
illustrated in Plate 6. We determine the climate model's 
sensitivity to cloud cover change by arbitrarily increasing the 
large-scale clouds in a given model layer. In each case we 
increase the cloud cover by 5% of the global area, by adding 
clouds in regions that are cloud-free in all layers of the control 
run. Thus, for example, the cloud cover in layer 1 is increased 
from the 32.5% in the control run to 37.5%. The optical depth 
of the added clouds is the same as that of the other large-scale 
clouds in that layer, as defined in Table 5. The control run has 
clouds only in layers 1-7, but f(•r didactic purposes we included 
cloud forcing in layers 8 and 9. The geographical and height 
distributions of clouds in the control run are shown in Plate 6. 
Figure 10 and Table 5 show that, on global average, the 
albedo effect of clouds below 7-8 km altitude dominates over 
their greenh{)use ffect and thus they cause a global cooling, 
while the opposite is true for higher clouds (if they are not too 
optically thick), consistent with earlier results [Manabe, 1975; 
Stephens and Webster, 1981]. 
6.2. Analysis of Cloud Feedback Effect 
We use the GCM's sensitivity to specified cloud changes to 
estimate the contribution of cloud feedbacks to climate 
sensitivity in the ghost and ozone experiments that were carried 
out with the standard (all feedback) version of the GCM. Many 
feedbacks contribute to the difference in the responses of the 
"fixed clouds" and "all feedbacks" models, including cloud 
changes as a function of height, latitude, season and time of day, 
as well as water vapor, sea ice, and dynamical changes. 
However, we anticipate that the cloud changes themselves will 
be the dominant mechanism, and among those, the above 
experiments suggest that the main effect may be cloud change as 
a function of height. 
We first illustrate the annual-mean global-mean temperature 
and cloud cover changes that occur in the ghost and ozone 
experiments. We then estimate quantitatively the contributions 
of the principal cloud changes to the temperature changeø 
Cloud feedbacks are simplest for the ghost forcing. Figure 11 
shows the temperature changes and cloud changes that occur in 
the GCM when a globally uniform ghost forcing is added at one 
of four different levels: the surface, layer 1, layer 4, and layer 7.

Plate 6. Annual mean cloud cover in control run 2: (a) global 
distribution of total cloud cover, and (b) latitude-height 
distribution of clouds. 
Calculated clouds are a positive feedback for a ghost forcing 
added in the lower troposphere, neutral for a forcing in the mid 
troposphere, and a negative feedback for an upper tropospheric 
ghost forcing. 
The principal effect of the ghost heating on cloud cover is a 
reduction of large-scale clouds within the layer that is heated, as 
illustrated in Figure 1 le. This mechanism qualitatively explains 
the dependence of the cloud feedback on the altitude of the ghost 
forcing, as reduction of low level clouds causes warming, while 
reduction of high clouds causes cooling. A second effect of the 
ghost heating is to increase the local static stability, thus 
decreasing convection from below; in the lower part of the 
troposphere this reduced convection increases the cloud cover in 
the layer below. This second effect reduces the positive cloud 
feedback in the low troposphere, and it eliminates the positive 
feedback in the middle troposphere. When the ghost heating is 
added to layer 1, however, there is no lower layer with a negative 
feedback, so this case yields the strongest positive feedback. 
Finally, we note that surface warming causes an increase of high 
level clouds, which is one reason that the GISS GCM has a 
relatively high climate sensitivity [Hansen et al., 1983]. 
The cloud feedback for ozone change (Figure 12) has some 
characteristics in common with the ghost forcing (Figure 11), but 
ozx•ne change, because ozone effectively emits thermal radiation 
and absorbs solar radiation, alters the amount of heat added to a 
layer in a more complicated way. Consider first the case when 
ozone is added to layer 1. The added ozone allows layer 1 to 
cool to space more effectively (via the 9.6 pm ozone band, in the 
•niddle of the Earth's infrared "window"), thus lowering the 
temperature of layer 1 and increasing the cloud cover there. 
Cooling from the added clouds exceeds warming from the added 
ozone. When ozone is added to layer 3, it cools that layer and 
thus slightly increases cloud cover there; but the decreased 
vertical stability decreases cloud cover in layers 1 and 2 (Figure 
12e), ,and thus the net effect of the ozone and cloud changes is a 
strong warming (Figure 12b). When ozone is added to layer 7, 
which is near a minimum in the vertical profile of temperature, 
it warsns that layer and thus decreases the large-scale cloud cover 
there. 
Now let us examine how well the cloud cover changes can 
"explain" the climate model sensitivity when all feedbacks are 
allowed to operate. First, consider the "paradoxical" case in 
which ozone added to layer 1 causes a planetary cooling. Table 
6 gives the annual-mean global-mean cloud cover change (6C) 
for each atmospheric level. Table 6 also gives an estimate of the 
contribution to the surface temperature change from the cloud 
change in each layer (6Ts) based on the ATs/cloud cover relation 
from Table 5. The sum of the /ST• for all layers is -0.59øC, 
essentially the same as the difference in AT• between the fixed 
cloud and calculated cloud GCM experiments (-0.58øC). This 
nearly perfect agreement is accidental, but similar checks for 
ozone changes in other layers (Table 6) confirm that the mean 
cloud change with altitude accounts for most of the difference 
between the climate sensitivities with fixed clouds and calculated 
clouds, in the case of ozone forcing. 
This simple calculation, accounting only for the altitude 
dependence of the cloud change, does not explain the effect of 
calculated clouds on climate sensitivity so accurately in all cases. 
The latitude dependence of the cloud change also affects the 
simulated surface temperature change; the principal latitudinal 
variation is between low latitudes and high latitudes, with a 
smaller variation between hemispheres (Table 7). Furthermore, 
the sensitivities to cloud changes (Table 5) were obtained by

adding clouds in regions that were cloud-free in all layers, which 
tends to overestimate the effect of the cloud change for other 
situations. A •nore precise accounting requires consideration of 
cloud overlap effects. 
6.3. ½)ther Cloud Forcings 
Cloud forcings, in addition to change of cloud cover, include 
change of cloud height, cloud optical thickness, cloud liquid 
water content, and cloud particle size, but the effect of changing 
cloud height is iinplicitly included in our tabulated results for 
change of cloud cover (Table 5). For any cloud height change of 
interest it is only necessary to determine the corresponding 
change of cloud cover in our fixed atmospheric levels and sum 
over the nine levels. 
Similarly, although we have not explicitly examined the 
effects of changing either cloud liquid water content or cloud 
particle size, the climate sensitivity to changes of these 
parmneters can be inferred from the sensitivity to changes of 
cloud optical thickness to a reasonable approximation, assuming 
that the cloud particles are sufficiently large, say greater than 5 
pm in effective radius. Therefore we include in Table 5 the 
sensitivity of cli•nate forcing and cli•nate response to change of 
optical thickness for low cloutIs and high clouds. 
As expected, an increased opacity of optically thin high clouds 
causes war•ning while increased opacity of low clouds causes 
c•oling. The sensitivities indicated are only valid for small 
perturbations about today's climatology. Indeed, as is well 
known, the effect of clouds on infrared radiation saturates at a 
smaller optical depth than does the cloud albedo, so if the optical 
depth •f high clouds becomes large enough the clouds cause a 
cooling. Lacis et al. [1979] find that the maximum greenhouse 
effect for high level clouds occurs at optical depth about 2, and 
the effect shifts to cooling only for optical depths greater than 
ab•ut 10, the optical depth of this switchover depending on 
cloudtop temperature. 
7. Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) Experiments 
The increase of radiative forcing due to chlorofluorocarbons, 
which are entirely of anthropogenic origin, has exceeded the 
radiative forcing of all other greenhouse gases except CO 2 for the 
past three decades [Hansen et al., 1989]. Thus it is important 
that the CFC forcing be accurately determined. Also it is of 
special interest o examine the net forcing due to CFC plus ozone 
changes, as observed ozone depletion is presumed to be caused 
pri•n•ily by CFCs. We calculate here the radiative forcings by 
CFC-11 (CC13F) and CFC-12 (CC12F2) , which cause most of the 
current CFC radiative forcing [Hansen et al., 1989; IPCC, 1992]. 
()ther CFCs will beco•ne relatively more important in the future 
as the abundances of CFC-11 and CFC-12 are expected to 
decline, and all of the CFCs must be included in projections of 
future changes of radiative forcing. 
7.1. CFC Vertical Profile 
CFCs, because of their long lifetimes, are reasonably 
well-mixed in the troposphere, but because CFCs decompose in 
the stratosphere, we must consider how their abundance 
decreases with altitude. Assumptions used in the literature range 
from (1) ho•nogeneous •nixing throughout he at•nosphere to (2) 
homogeneous mixing up to 12 km (H0) and then exponential 
decrease toward higher altitudes with 3 km scale height (H). 
Atmospheric data [Kawa et al., 1993] suggest that an 
intermediate assumption, (3) uniform •nixing to H 0 = 16 k•n and 
then exponential decrea•se with H = 10 km scale height, is a more 
realistic approximation. This is confirmned by recent satellite 
measurements of CFC-12 profiles as a function of latitude 
[Nightingale et al., 1996]. 
We co•npare the forcings and climate model responses for all 
three of these height profiles in Table 8. The integrated CFC 
mnount for the •nost realistic height profile (H 0 = 16 km, H = 10 
kin) falls about •nidway between the amounts for the two 
extreme cases, but F•, AT 0 and AT• for the most realistic case are 
closer to the case with homogeneous mixing because CFCs at the 
highest altitudes become a less effective climate forcing, as we 
documented for the ghost forcing (Table 4 and Figure 8). The 
most co•nmonly used CFC distribution, uniform mixing, 
overestimates the forcing by about 8% (under the assmnption

that H 0 = 16 kin, H = 10 km adequately approximates theeffect 
of actual latitude dependent profiles). The CFC profile with H 0 
= 12 km and H = 3 km, although perhaps realistic for middle 
latitudes, underestimates the global F• by about 18%. 
Thus variations of the assumed CFC vertical profiles are a 
significant cause of differences among the climate forcings 
calculated by different investigat{•rs. The dependence of the 
forcing on the CFC profile provided in Table 8 can be used to 
scale the results ()f any m(•del f()r ()ne assumed profile to another 
prtffile, provided that the assumed profile has been specified. 
F•r example, Pinm•ck e! alo I1995] point out that their forcing for 
CFC-11 is 30% greater than that assumed by IPCC [ 1992], the 
latter being based on 1-D radiative-convective model results 
given in Appendix B of Hansen et •d. [ 1988]. However, Pinnock 
et al. employed uniform mixing (K. Shine, private 
communication, 1996) while the equation of Hansen et al. was 
based on 1-D model calculations for a midlatitude atmosphere 
with CFC-11 having the H 0 = 12 km, H = 3 km vertical 
distribution Thus the vertical distributions account for a forcing 
difference {ff (1.08 - 0.82)/0.82 • 32%, that is, the different 
vertical distributions appear to be a major cause of the difference 
in radiative forcings. This c•e illustrates the importance ofboth 
using arealistic distribution a d specifying the distribution that 
is used. 
Another source of differences among models is the assumed 
absorption coefficientsø CFC-11 absorption coefficients in 
previous GISS radiation calculations were based on work by 
Nanes et al. [1980]. However, more recent data ()f Li and 
Varanasi [1994], as well as the average of all data compiled by 
N. Christidis and K. Shine (private communication, 1996), 
suggest a value 10% higher, which we have adopted here. The 
CFC-12 abst)rption coefficient used here is that of Morcillo el al. 
11966]. 
Still other sources of differences among the models arise from 
mt•del dimensionality (low dimension models requiring 
approximations forintegrating over space, season, and cloud 
effects) and other approximations in the radiative calculations. 
()ur present 3-D calculatitms explicitly and accurately average 
over space and time, including a realistic amount and distribution 
tff clouds. The radiative transfer scheme used here is that of 
Lacis and Oinas [1991 ], with the thermal spectrum divided into 
bands t•f approximately 100 wavenumber width, each spectral 
band being ch,'u'acterized by a full range of absorption coefficient 
values which are then regrouped intt• 25 k intervals for efficient

doubling-adding radiative calculations. For simplicity, CFC 
absorption in the GISS GCM is applied as a constant across the 
relevant (• 100 wavenmnber) spectral interval (weak line 
approximation); although this approximation makes the 
nonlinearity of CFC absorption weaker than in the real world, it 
has negligible i•npact for realistic CFC amounts. 
Our current best esti•nate for CFC forcings, as specified in 
Table 8, is 0.063 W/•n 2 for 250 ppt of CFC-11 and 0.15 Wfin 2 for 
500 ppt of CFC-12, the approxi•nate concentrations of recent 
years; results vary linearly for smaller amounts. By comparison, 
the parameterizations in Appendix B of Hansen et al. [1988] 
yield values of 0.055 W/m 2 and 0.14 W/m 2, respectively. Thus 
our present CFC forcings, based on 3-D calculations with H 0 = 16 
km, H = 10 Ion, are only about 5% greater than our earlier results 
based on 1-D calculations with H 0 = 12 km, H = 3 Ion when we 
use the same CFC absorption coefficients as used by Hansen et 
al. [ 1988]. It follows that for the same CFC vertical distribution, 
the GCM yields a forcing about 10% smaller than that obtained 
from the 1-D •nodel. In other wc)rds, in comparing our present 
best esti•nate for the CFC-11 forcing with the result of Hansen et 
al. [1988], there is a decrease in the calculated forcing arising 
from use of the GCM to average over the world which partially 
cancels increases due to the new CFC-11 absorption coefficient 
and the •nore realistic vertical distribution of CFCs (H 0 = 16 km, 
H = 10 km). As the GCM explicitly averages over season, 
latitude, and cloudy and cloud-free situations, the present results 
represent our best estimate for the CFC forcings. 
Finally, we compare our present CFC forcing with recent 
results of Pinnock et al. [1995]. Their calculated forcing for 250 
ppt of CFC-11 is 0.067 W/m 2. Pinnock et al. [1995] employ a 
uniform mixing of CFCs, implying that we must reduce their 
result by 8% to make it comparable to our computations with H 0 
= 16 lon, H = 10 lon. This makes their result 0.062 W/m 2, almost 
the same as our result. Such precise agreement is probably 
accidental; it seems likely that there are compensations among 
any differences in radiative approximations and integrations over 
the globe. Despite the close agreement of our results, we 
estimate that there remains an absolute uncertainty in the CFC-11 
forcing of the order of 10%. 
7.2. CFCs Versus ()3: An Extreme Experiment 
As CFCs are known to cause ozone depletion in the tropo- 
pause region, it is of interest o compare CFC and O 3 radiative

forcing caused by removing all ozone from layers 7 and 8 
(70-255 mbar), i.e., F,, = 1.54 W/m 2. Because the CFC and ozone 
forcings are of opposite sign, when they are inserted 
simultaneously into the Wonderland model the climate response 
sht•uld be negligible if different forcings are approximately 
equivalent. 
()ne reason to employ balanced forcings is that the sensitivity 
of the climate model, and presumably the real world, is larger for 
a finite negative forcing than for a positive forcing of equal 
magnitude (compare S O experiments; the main reason for the 
larger response toward a colder climate is the greater sea ice 
change). This bias in the resp•nse is largely awfided with 
balanced forcings, a technique which we also used above for 
gh•st fi•rcings and will emph•y below fi•r aerosols and 
greenh•use gases. 
l•latc 7 and Table 8 shrew that with fixed cl(•uds the net zen• 
fi•rcing yields •mly a small gl{•bal mean temperature change (AT• 
=-().14('C) if cl•mds are fixed, but a strong global warming (AT• 
- ().81 "C) if clt•uds are calculated. The strongest warming 
t•ccurs at the h•cations (high latitudes) which have a strong 
negative fi•rcing (Plate 7b). Thus this case clearly illustrates the 
absence of propt•rtitmality between radiative forcing and climate 
response, both gh•bally anti regionally. 
The reasons for this superficially anomalous response are 
readily understandable. Plate 7b shows that the null global-mean 
adjusted forcing is achieved via p(•sitive fi•rcing at low latitudes 
and negative forcing at high latitudes. By itself, this factor 
w{•uld cause the global mean response to be a cooling because, 
as we have shown, high latitudes are more sensitive t• a given 
radiative forcing than are low latitudes. However, another 
important factor is the altitude distribution of the levels at which 
the radiative energy input occurs, which is shown in Figure 13. 
The negative ozone forcing occurs near the tropopause, while the 
CFC fi•rcing is weighted more toward the surface, where a 
fi•rcing is more effective at altering surface temperature, 
especially at high latitudes, as we have shown in earlier sections. 
The resulting response to the net CFC and O3 forcing is 
consistent with the results for the two individual forcings 
(sections 4 and 7.1). 
7.3. ½), Forcing: 1979-1994 
The aN•ve CFC-():• comparison illustrates our thesis that equal 
forcings do not necessarily ield similar climate responses. But 
a m•re relevant case is to compare the forcings and responses for 
mexsured changes of CFCs and O3. A difficulty with this case is 
that the real-world changes of ()• are not measured precisely.

using SAGE for the latitude-dependent vertical profile of 03 
change down to 17 km altitude and constraining the ozone 
amount below 17 km to match the column 03 change measured 
by TOMS. Profile B, used by J. Hansen et al. (manuscript in 
preparation, 1997), was constructed from an updated version of 
SAGE data (J. Zawodny, private communication, December 
1994) and solar backscattered ultraviolet (SBUV) data 
[Hollandsworth et al., 1995] after using data from several 
(northern hemisphere) ozonesonde stations [Logan, 1994] to 
specify a tropospheric ozone change profile for latitudes 
northward of 30øS; SBUV was used to specify the 03 change 
profile above the 32 mbar level (-24 km), SAGE was used 
between 32 and 125 mbar (-24-15 km), with the 03 change in 
model ayers 1-7 adjusted to yield the SBUV column 03 change. 
The profile B changes are specified in greater spatial and 
temporal detail by Hansen et al. (manuscript in preparation, 
1997). Profiles A and B thus are dependent on arbitrary 
assumptions about tropospheric ozone change, as well as 
iraprecisions inthe satellite measurements. Recent reanalyses of 
the satellite data suggest some changes to the SAGE profiles 
[Wang et al., 1996; Cunnold et al., 1996] and a somewhat 
reduced ozone depletion from (version 7) TOMS (R. D. 
McPeters, private communication, 1996). However, these 
changes should not qualitatively alter our conclusions here. 
Indeed, we mention below empirical evidence that the radiative 
forcing we obtain with profile B is realistic. 
Although ozone profiles A and B are superficially similar, the 
climate forcing is about 40% larger for profile B than for profile 
A (Table 3), and the calculated equilibrium climate response is 
similarly larger for profile B (27% for fixed clouds, 67% for 
calculated clouds). The principal cause of temperature change 
for both the profile A and profile B experiments is the ozone 
depletion near the tropopause, especially in model layer 8 
(70-150 mbar), but the main cause of the difference between the

profile A and B results (fi•r both F,, and ATs) is the difference in 
the tropospheric ozone changes between A and B. This 
conclusion is obtained by summing the expected contributions 
(to F• and ATs) fr(m• individual layers, but it is also suggested by 
comparison of the A() 3 and AT profiles in Figure 14. Thus 
reliable assessment of the climate forcing due to ozone change 
requires improved knowledge of the ozone change at 
trop(•spheric levels. This is true fi•r ozt•ne change on the century 
timescale [Hauglustaine et al., 1994] as well as shorter 
timescales. 
Forcing (W/m 2) 
We cannot prove which of profiles A and B is more realistic; 
indeed, the true profile of ozone change may fall outside the 
range of these two estimates. The tropospheric ozone changes in 
profile B are at least based on tropospheric measurements, but 
the stations are confined to the northern hemisphere [Logan 
1994] and do not sample well tropical regions where biomass 
burning may be causing an increase of tropospheric ozone [Jiang 
and Yung, 1996]. Overall, profile B is based on more obser- 
vati•ns of profile change, and we believe that it is the more 
realistic of the two pnffiles.

Figure 14. (a) Ozone change profile (global-mean, annual-mean) for the 15-year period 1979-1994 based on two

(b) Temperature change calculated for the assumed ozone change profiles, with fixed clouds. (c) Same as Figure 
14b, but with calculated clouds. 
The radiative forcings and climate responses calculated with 
profiles B and A lead us to suggest hat the climate effects of 
ozone change are larger than has generally been believed. For 
exmnple, IPCC [1994, 1995] estimates the forcing due to ozone 
depletion as -0.1 W/m 2, a factor of 2-3 smaller than our result. 
The IPCC result is based in part on the forcing calculated by 
Ramaswamy et al. [1992], who obtained F a = -0.08 W/m 2 for 
satellite-observed ozone changes in the period 1979-1990 (which 
scales to -0.11 W/m 2 for 1979-1994), and a similar result of 
Schwarzkopfand Rtmutswamy [ 1993]. Both of these results were 
obtained with 2-D radiative models. To investigate the reasons 
for their smaller forcing, we made calculations with a 2-D 
radiative-convective model using the same assumptions as 
Ramaswamy et al. for the vertical ozone change, specifically 
restricting the ozone change to be entirely in the 7 km region 
above the tropopause; our calculated forcing was in good 
agreement with that of Ramaswamy et al. Thus our radiation 
seems to be consistent with theirs. The reason that we obtain a 
larger forcing with ozone loss profile A and B is that these 
profiles have a substantial ozone reduction near the tropopause 
including a moderate loss just beneath the tropopause, while 
Ramaswamy et al. [1992], by assumption, consider only ozone 
loss above the tropopause. Removing a small amount of ozone 
from the tropopause region (where it is coldest, but ozone lines 
are still pressure broadened) and adding a similar amount in the 
lower troposphere causes a significant cooling without changing 
the column ozone amount. 
The question is whether our estimated ozone change for the 
full profile exaggerates the ozone depletion and the resulting 
climate forcing. Observational data for ozone change, especially 
in the critical tropopause region, are limited and tend to change 
as calibrations and analyses are modified, but there is empirical 
evidence in observed temperature change suggesting that we 
have not exaggerated the forcing due to ozone depletion. The 
temperature change is particularly relevant, because the 
mechanism by which the ozone depletion cools the surface is via 
reduction of longwave radiation to the surface due to cooling of 
the local atmospheric level. The most precise relevant measure 
of temperature change during the period of ozone depletion is 
provided by microwave sounding unit (MSU) channel 4 data 
[Spencer and Christy, 1993], which samples mainly altitudes 
16-24 kin. The MSU data show a cooling of about 0.9øC over 
the period 1979-1994. Model simulations, with different 
radiative forcings, based on the same radiation scheme as 
employed here, suggest hat ozone change is the main cause of 
the cooling, with the profile B ozone change yielding slightly 
less cooling than observed [Hansen et al., manuscript in 
preparation, 1997]. This suggests that we have not exaggerated 
the ozone loss and the resulting lower stratospheric cooling 
which is the immediate cause of the negative climate forcing. 
Our inference of a large negative ozone climate forcing in the 
period 1979-1994 is based on a rather crude estimate of the 
ozone change. Given the calculated magnitude of the forcing, it 
would be useful to obtain the best possible estimate of ozone 
change from all observations now available, compute the 
resulting climate forcing and temperature change, and compare 
the temperature change with observations including the profile 
of temperature change in the tropopause region. 
7.4. Implications for Net Greenhouse Forcing 
We compare our calculated radiative forcing due to observed 
ozone change with forcings due to well-mixed greenhouse gases 
in Figure 15. If profile A were correct, ozone change more than 
balanced all CFC forcing (and was about one third of the total 
greenhouse forcing). Profile B yields an even larger effect, the 
ozone change balancing all of the non-CO 2 greenhouse forcing 
(about half of the total greenhouse forcing). Of course, a 
balancing of global forcings does not imply a balancing of 
temperature changes, especially on a regional scale. 
However, the bar graph presentation in Figure 15 understates 
the impact of stratospheric ozone depletion on the net global 
radiative forcing. To first order, the observed ozone change 
probably can be thought of as the combined effect of 
"stratospheric" ozone depletion, driven by anthropogenic 
chlorine and bromine, and a tropospheric ozone increase driven 
by anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning. The C1/Br 
driven depletion seems likely to cause ozone depletion in the 
troposphere, as well as in the stratosphere, as ozone depletion in 
6856 HANSEN ET AL.: RADIATIVE FORCING AND CLIMATE RESPONSE 
the lower stratosphere should reduce the downward flux of 
stratospheric ozone. Based on either the results for the two 
ozone profiles in Figure 14a or on the sensitivities in Table 3, we 
estimate that if the C1/Br mechanism causes a small tropospheric 
depletion the net forcing due to C1/Br ozone depletion may be 
-0.4 to -0.5 W/m 2, which is partially balanced by a forcing of 
+0.1 to +0.2 W/m 2 due to the increase of tropospheric ozone 
caused by anthropogenic pollution. It is important to try to 
separate the effects on ozone of the C1/Br and tropospheric 
pollution mechanisms because the C1/Br contribution should 
begin to decrease in the next several years, as anthropogenic 
emissions of C1 and Br coinpounds are expected to decline. 
We do not attempt to analyze the implications of the partial 
balancing of CFC and ()• radiative forcings, and how this 
balancing will be altered by future CFC emission changes. 
Daniel et al. [1995] and Solotram and Daniel[1996] examine this 
question, assuming a negative forcing due to ozone depletion in

AN2() = 10.5 ppb, ACFC-12 = 231 ppt and ACFC-11 = 111 ppt. 
Forcing by other CFCs is based on the rate calculated by Hansen 
et al. [1989] for the 1980s, revised to account for the fact that 
recent data on CFC-114 and CFC-116 [Harnisch et al., 1996] 
indicate slower growth than that assumed by Hansen et al. 
[1989]; also it is assumed that the accelerated growth of some 
CFCs during 1990-1994 was balanced by decelerated growth of 
CFC-113, the single greatest contributor to "other CFCs" in the 
1980s. 
the 1980s ranging from -0.1 W/m: [Ramaswamy et at., 1992; 
SchwarzkopfandRamaswamy, 1993; IPCC, 1994] to-0.3 W/m 2. 
They conclude that a surge of positive radiative forcing will 
occur in the first decade of the 21st century as ozone amounts 
recover. Our results based on observed ozone change offer 
support for the upper end of the effect estimated by Solomon and 
Daniel; that is, our results favor the stronger of their trends for 
net climate forcing change in the next 10 years. However, our 
large ozone forcing arises from just the direct ozone effect, 
without adding any indirect forcings. 
Mechanisms for indirect radiative forcing due to ozone change 
have been proposed by Bekki et at. [1994] and Toumi et al. 
[1994]. Bekki et al. argue that stratospheric ozone depletion has 
depressed the growth rates of tropospheric CI-t 4 and CO, the 
mechanism being increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation 
into the troposphere and thus increased abundance of the 
chemical scavenger OH. Toumi et al. argue that the same 
mechanism increases •xidation of SO2, thus increasing aerosol 
abundance and cloud albedos. There is some empirical evidence 
supporting slowdowns of CI-t 4 and C() growth during the period 
of increasing ozone depletion. To whatever degree the effects 
proposed by Bekki et al. and Toumi et al. are operating, they 
work in the same sense as the negative climate forcing due to 
ozone depletion. Evidently, quantitative evaluation of climate 
forcings requires more specific and accurate measurements than 
presently available, especially measurements of ozone, aerosol, 
and cloud changes. 
We conclude that better measurements and understanding of 
ozone changes are needed to evaluate accurately present and 
future climate fi•rcing, but estimates of ozone change for 
1979-1994 indicate that ozone depletion in the lower 
stratosphere-tropopause region caused a large (negative) forcing, 
which considerably reduced the net greenhouse forcing of the 
climate system. This conclusion supports the expectation that a 
positive surge of net greenhouse forcing will accompany the 
expected recovery of lower stratospheric ozone abundance. 
8. Aerosol Experiments 
B•th natural and anthropogenic hanges of aerosols cause 
significant radiative forcing, as discussed in hundreds of research 
papers and many reviews [e.g., Andreae, 1995; Charlson and 
Heintzenberg, 1995; IPCC, 1994]. Stratospheric aerosols arising 
from volcanoes cause an aperiodic negative forcing, and there is 
evidence of global cooling after the largest eruptions [Self and 
Rampino, 1988; Robock, 1991; Hansen et at., 1996]. 
Anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols are calculated to cause a 
ct•oling which may have partially balanced anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas warming over the past century [Hansen et al., 
1993a; IPCC, 1994; Mitchell et al., 1995]. 
It is well recognized that the inhomogeneous distribution of 
aerosols implies that there can be no simple balancing of aerosol 
and greenhouse gas forcings. There have been many investiga- 
tions of how aerosol forcing depends upon parameters such as 
optical depth, aerosol size, single scatter albedo, backscatter 
fraction or asymmetry p•ameter, and surface reflectivity, but the 
basic issue of whether the climate response has a fixed 
proportionality to the aerosol radiative forcing has not been 
studied extensively. 
The fundamental aerosol parameters are optical depth 'c and 
single scatter albedo •; 'c is proportional to aerosol amount; as 
both radiative forcing and climate response are nearly linear for 
HANSEN ET AL.: RADIATIVE FORCING AND CLIMATE RESPONSE 6857 
the small optical depths of greatest interest, it is sufficient in 
what follows to consider esults for the single value •; = 0.1. This 
leaves • (which depends mainly on aerosol composition and 
size) as the basic parameter to be explored. All other parameters 
are specified implicitly via the GCM's realistic spectral and 
spatial distribution of surface albedos, as well as by use of an 
aerosol size distribution and refractive index typical of terrestrial 
sulfate aerosols. The effect of alternative choices for aerosol 
properties can be approximated well by scaling •; and • with 
similarity relations [van de Hulst and Grossman, 1968; Hansen, 
19691. 
8.1. Stratospheric Aerosols 
The equilibrium response in our 100-year GCM simulations 
with stratospheric aerosol single scatter albedo in the visible 
spectrum (•c) ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 is summarized in Table 9 
and Figures 16a and 16b. In all cases we use a size distribution 
of spherical sulfuric acid aerosols with effective radius about 0.5 
lam, as in the work by Lacis et al. [1992]. To test the effect of 
aerosol absorption, the sulfuric acid • is replaced by •c at 
wavelengths where til• is less than • of sulfuric acid, i.e., at 
essentially all wavelengths less than 3 mm. 
The mean surface temperature response to the aerosol forcing 
in the case of conservative scattering (• - 1) is consistent with 
that for forcings such as changes of solar irradiance, as 
sutnmarized by the result R -• 1 for both fixed clouds and 
calculated clouds. It might be anticipated that the mechanism of 
simple reflection of sunlight by aerosols above the troposphere 
has a cli•nate effect similar to that of reduced solar irradiance, 
and these results confirm that expectation. 
The results change dramatically for nonconservative 
scattering. Consider the case • - 0.9: for fixed clouds the 
surface cooling is only -0.31 øC, while for calculated clouds it is 
-1.75 øC. The responsivity R (relative to equivalent solar forcing) 
is about 0.3 for fixed clouds and 1.3 for calculated clouds. A 
striking illustration is provided by the climate feedback factor, f 
-- ATs/AT 0, shown in Figures 16b and 16d: if the climate 
response depended only on the magnitude of the forcing, the 
feedback factor would be a constant f • 2-3, but we find that f 
varies strongly with the aerosol single scatter albedo. 
This seetningly cotnplex behavior (Figure 16 and Table 9) can 
be understood readily with the help of the sensitivities tabulated 
for "ghost" heating of different atmospheric layers (Table 4). 
The principal terms that must be accounted for are cooling due 
to the blocking of incoming solar radiation by the aerosols and 
heating due to absorption of solar radiation by the aerosols, 
which warms the stratosphere and in turn warms the surface at 
the rate specified by "ghost" heating. More precise analysis 
requires including the effect of • on the amount of diffuse solar 
radiation and changes of absorption of upwelling radiation. 
The mechanisms which cause the strong deviations of the 
climate response from that which would be predicted based on 
the adjusted forcing (or from AT0) are as follows. First, for the 
case of fixed clouds, AT s increases much more rapidly with 
decreasing • than indicated by AT 0 or F a. This is because nergy 
absorbed in the stratosphere causes a greater warming of the 
surface in our GCM (and presumably in the real world) than that 
calculated from only radiative processes (say in a radiative- 
convective model). This phenomenon, demonstrated in our ghost 
forcing experiments ( ection 5), works via alteration of the lapse 
rate, which makes warming of the lower stratosphere more 
effective on surface temperature than in a radiative-convective 
model (Table 4, R values for fixed clouds). 
Second, for the case of calculated clouds, warming of the 
stratosphere reduces high level (cirrus) clouds, thus causing a 
surface cooling which adds to the aerosol cooling, making the 
total feedback factor -4. This phenomenon was isolated in our 
ghost forcing experiments, as quantified by the values of R less 
than unity for ghost heating of stratospheric layers with 
calculated clouds (Table 4). 
Sulfuric acid, the principal stratospheric aerosol, h•ts ingle 
scatter albedo near unity, but results for absorbing aerosols are 
of more than academic interest. Volcanic ash, meteoritic 
tnaterial, aircraft pollution, and other aerosols can have single 
scatter albedo significantly less than unity. 
8.2. Tropospheric Aerosols 
In the troposphere, absorption by aerosols has an even greater 
impact than it does in the stratosphere, for two reasons. First, 
energy absorbed within the troposphere is more effectively 
transferred into a T s increase, as illustrated by the effectiveness 
of ghost heating vs. altitude (Figure 8 and Table 4). Second, 
tropospheric aerosols are concentrated in the lower layers of the 
atmosphere, where aerosol absorption causes a positive climate

of CO2, solar irradiance and some other forcings is not accurate 
for absorbing aerosols, and (2) when our si•nulation of the 
semidirect aerosol effect on clouds is included with • .• 
0.9-0.95, the surface temperature change is very small. 
Furthermore, values of • = 0.9 are not hypothetical. Ogren and 
Sheridan [1996] report values typically • = 0.88-0.96 for aircraft 
measurements of tropospheric aerosols over the United States. 
Penner et a/.[1992] estimate • = 0.92 for biomass burning 
aerosols. Mie calculations by Haywood and Shine [1995] for 
plausible soot/sulfate aerosol composition yield typically • = 
0.8-0.96. The extensive aerosols from disturbed soils in arid 
regions typically have • = 0.85-0.95 (Tegen et al., 1996). 
Aerosols versus greenhouse gases. We examine the 
difference in the cli•nate response to aerosol and greenhouse gas 
forcings by considering two cases in which the aerosol and 
greenhouse gas forcings are equal in •nagnitude and opposite in 
sign. In the first case we use aerosol single scattering albedo • 
= 1 and in the second case • = 0.9. In both cases we use the 
geographical distribution of aerosols pecified in Figure 16 of 
Hansen et al. [1993a]. The global mean aerosol optical depth is 
z =0.034, with 0.017 distributed according to the sulfate 
distribution of Charlson et al. [1991] and the other 0.017 
distributed at low latitudes simulating biomass burning. 
Adjusted forcings are •; -0.86 W/•n 2 for • =1 and • -0.32 W/•n 2 
for • = 0.9. The amount of greenhouse gases was taken as that 
occurring at the ti•ne in the greenhouse gas scenario of Hansen 
et al. [1993a] at which the adjusted greenhouse gas forcing 
exactly balanced the adjusted aerosol forcing. Results for the 
calculated climate response are summarized in Table 10 and 
Plates 8 and 9. 
The global mean AT• is small for both • = 1 and • = 0.9 in 
the case of fixed clouds. Also the regional response (AT 0 is 
damped and smoothed considerably, relative to the forcing (F•), 
although some hint of the location of the forcings is maintained 
in the response. On the other hand, with calculated clouds there 
is a large global mean warming for both • = 1 and • = 0.9. For 
the case • = 1 this arises because there is a strong net positive 
forcing in the sea ice regions which have high equilibrium 
sensitivity in our model. For the case • = 0.9 the mechanism 
causing the global warming is the semidirect effect of absorbing 
aerosols on low level cloud cover. 
Summary. Our general conclusion is that in comparing 
aerosol and greenhouse gas cli•nate effects, it can be misleading 
and is thus insufficient to simply compare their radiative 
6860 HANSEN ET AL.: RADIATIVE FORCING AND CLIMATE RESPONSE 
forcings. Our specific conclusion regarding anthropogenic 
aerosols is that their net "direct" impact on global surface 
temperature, including "semidirect" changes of cloud cover, is 
probably small and even its sign is uncertain. 
These conclusions do not refer to the indirect aerosol effect on 
cloud microphysics [Twomey, 1974; Charlson et al., 1992; IPCC, 
1994] which is believed to cause a significant negative climate 
forcing. Indeed, observations of cooling in regions of 
anthropogenic aerosols [Karl et al., 1995] and damping of the 
diurnal cycle over land areas [Hansen et al., 1995a] offer 
empirical evidence for such an indirect aerosol effect. Rather our 
results call into question the conclusion [Charlson et al., 1992; 
IPCC, 1994] that the direct aerosol effect has an impact on global 
temperature comparable to the indirect aerosol effect, with both 
causing cooling represented by a forcing of the order of 1 W/m 2. 
()ther recent studies [Kiehl and Briegleb. 1993; Hansen et al., 
1993a] have suggested that the magnitude of the direct aerosol 
forcing was being overestimated, as reflected in IPCC [1995]; 
the present results carry this one step further, suggesting that 
anthropogenic aerosols have little if any direct cooling effect. 
9. Surface Albedo Experiments 
Surface albedo changes are another important climate forcing. 
Changes in ice sheet area and vegetation distribution are 
estimated to have caused a forcing -3.5 W/m 2 during the ice age 
20,(X)0 years ago, ab•ut half •f the forcing required to maintain 
the ice age cold [Hansen et at., 1993a]. A surface albedo change 
of more immediate interest is that caused by anthropogenic land 
use. Hansen et al. (manuscript in preparation. 1997) calculate a 
gl{•bal mean forcing of-0.4 W/m 2 when natural (preindustrial) 
vegetatk•n is replaced by current land use patterns. Thus it is of 
interest o determine the effectiveness of surface albedo forcings. 
In our first surface albedo experiment we increased the 
surface albedo by 0.2 •ver all of Tropicana, and in a second 
experiment we increased the albedo of Northland by 0.2 at 
latitudes • 55øN. The results (Table 11) show that albedo 
change is somewhat less effective than an equivalent change of 
solar irradiance (R < 1), especially in the case of calculated 
clouds. This result might seem surprising, given the similar 
nature of the forcing for an albedo change and a solar irradiance 
change, but the forcings differ because the surface albedo change 
,,,-,-,•r• nt n •n•,-iflc r.qnop t-•f l.qtih•le• while ihe •la[ fi•rcin9 has 
a smooth distribution with latitude, peaking at the equator 
(Figure 4). The present results are consistent with the latitude 
dependence of the responsivity to a ghost forcing into the surface 
(Table 4), which was discussed in section 5. For example, the 
low responsivity with calculated clouds is in part a result of the 
forcing being confined to northern hemisphere latitudes, where 
it does not excite the strong southern hemisphere sea ice 
feedback (Table 4). 
We conclude that surface albedo change is a reasonably 
well-behaved forcing. However, its effectiveness is a function of 
the geographic location of the albedo change. 
Finally. it is of interest to ask whether a surface albedo change 
is equivalent to an aerosol forcing of equal value. Mitchell et al. 
[1995] implicitly make that assumption in their GCM 
simulations, as for convenience they use albedo change as a 
proxy for aerosol change. Although we have not made 
calculations of those forcings applied to the same region, our 
results suggest hat the substitution is not a bad approximation 
for the case of conservatively scattering aerosols (• =1). 
However, based on results in section 8.2, it is not in general a 
good approximation for aerosols with absorptions typical of the 
real world. 
10. Discussion 
Radiative forcing is an invaluable to•l for analysis of cli•nate 
change. We have found that the magnitude of the forcing is a 
fairly accurate predictor of the climate response in our GCM for 
most globally distributed radiative forcings, provided that the 
forcing is calculated after the stratospheric temperature has 
adjusted to the perturbation. However, there is a sensitivity of 
the climate response to the altitude and latitude of the forcing, 
which can alter the response/forcing ratio by several tens of 
percent or more in particular cases. Thus precise climate change 
studies must take into consideration the nature of the climate 
forcing as well as its magnitude in watts per square meter. 
The principal mechanisms causing the climate responsivity to 
vary from one forcing to another can be understood readily. One 
mechanism involves the tropospheric lapse rate, which can be 
altered depending upon the atmospheric level at which the 
radiative forcing is applied. A forcing in the upper troposphere, 
for example, preferentially warms or cools those layers, which 
adjust in part via radiation to space rather than by causing a 
temperature change uniformly through the column. 
A second mechanism causing the climate responsivity to vary 
from one forcing to another is the change of cloud cover caused 
by the forcing. The principal effect of heating within a given 
atmospheric layer is to reduce large-scale clouds within that 
layer. A specific case in which this mechanism may be 
imp•)rtant is absorbing tropospheric aerosols. We describe this 
aert•sol tint, act t)n clouds as a •em•cnrect acro•o• cloud effect. 
Its effect on cloud cover and surface temperature tends to be of 
opposite sign (warming) and thus compete with cooling from the 
s{•-called indirect aerosol-cloud effect. 
The precision with which these mechanisms are represented 
is dependent upon the degree of realism in our global climate 
model, which is limited by the use of the physical representations 
in the primitive GCM of ltansen et at. [1983]. Although the 
existence and sense of these mechanisms appear to be

straightforward, their magnitude depends on features of our 
particular model, especially the calculated clouds, and thus the 
mechanisms should be studied with other global models. 
However, we do not expect our overall conclusion, that climate 
response depends on the nature of the forcing as well as its 
magnitude, to be altered. We find that the results in recent 
papers touching on this topic, i.e., the dependence of climate 
response on the nature of the forcing, are in excellent agreement 
with the quantitative results in our tables. For example, we 
obtain the same small sensitivity to forcings found by Chen and 
Ramaswamy [ 1996] for cloud microphysical changes when they 
are restricted to the same level, latitudes, and fixed cloud cover 
as in the Chen and Ramaswamy experiments. 
We note that the broad range of climate mechanisms and 
forcings investigated in our present study serves to illustrate the 
merits of a highly efficient GCM for climate studies, as 
discussed in paper W1. Realistic simulation of climate 
mechanisms depends upon unconstrained coupling of the 
fundamental equations describing the system, as is permitted in 
a three-dimensional GCM, but it also requires a model with an 
efficiency permitting multiple experiments with different 
parameter values. 
Our present experiments yield, in addition to the above 
general conclusions• information on several specific climate 
forcings. We summarize here results for three of these forcings. 
{)zone change. At face value, observed values of ozone 
change during the period (1979-1994) imply a large negative 
radiative forcing• which offsets most of the positive forcing due 
to increasing carbon dioxide. The forcing due to ozone change 
is uncertain because it depends particularly on ozone changes in 
the middle and upper troposphere, where there are few 
measure•nents, especially at low latitudes. Unless the ozone 
changes are determined more precisely, it will be difficult to 
interpret quantitatively observed climate change. Nevertheless, 
available ozone data suggest that ozone change was a strong 
negative forcing over the past 1 1/2 decades. The calculations 
support the contention that the net greenhouse gas climate 
forcing will increase more rapidly in the near future as global 
ozone recovers from current anthropogenic depletion. 
Tropospheric aerosols. Absorbing tropospheric aerosols are 
a case in which the fixed proportionality between radiative 
forcing and climate response can break down. Aerosols with 
single scatter albedos as large as • = 0.9 can lead to net global 
warming, in part because of a semidirect cloud effect which 
reduces large-scale cloud cover in layers with absorbing aerosols. 
Present aerosol measurements are inadequate for a global 
assessment, but limited available data suggest hat on average 
anthropogenic aerosols are probably in the range • = 0.9-0.95. 
If so, the mean effect of aerosols on surface temperature is nearly 
neutral, excluding their indirect effect on cloud microphysics, 
and their overall effect is less of a negative forcing than has 
commonly been assumed. 
Solar irradiance. The net radiative forcing due to solar cycle 
irradiance variations and associated atmospheric ozone changes 
is about 0.2 W/m 2. This is sufficient to yield a climate response 
that is probably detectable, but of little practical significance. 
The climate response to solar variations on the timescale of the 
solar cycle is practically insensitive to uncertainties in 
equilibrium climate sensitivity, i.e., to the magnitude of radiative 
feedbacks. We conclude that it is not possible to infer climate 
sensitivity from observed cyclic variability of surface air 
temperature on decadal timescales. Solar variability may have 
more important climate effects on longer time scales, as the 
irradiance changes may be larger and the climate system has time 
to respond more fully. 
These findings have relevance to the interpretation of global 
climate change and assessment of the possible role of humankind 
in altering climate. The overall conclusion that radiative forcings 
are usually a good predictor of equilibrium climate response, and 
that exceptions are understandable and can be appropriately 
accounted for, is an optimistic one for climate interpretation and 
assessment, but the sensitivity of the net global forcing to ozone 
changes in the middle and upper troposphere and even more the 
sensitivity to small amounts of aerosol absorption and associated 
changes in cloud cover imply that present global measurements 
are inadequate for reliable interpretation of long-term climate 
change [Hansen et al., 1993b].
