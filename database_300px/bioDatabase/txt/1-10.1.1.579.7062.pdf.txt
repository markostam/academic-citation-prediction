ABSTRACT
Here we describe an episomal, one-vector system
which allows the generation of cell populations
displaying homogenous, inducible gene inactivation
by RNA interference in a one step procedure. A dual
tet-repressor/activator system tightly controls a bi-
directional promoter, which simultaneously drives
expression of microRNAs and a fluorescent marker
protein. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
vector by knockdown of p53 expression in a human
cell line which resulted in the expected loss of G1-
arrest after DNA damage. The generation of a cell pool
homogenously expressing the ectopic microRNAs
was achieved in 1 week without the need for viral
infections. Induction of microRNA expression did not
elicit an interferon response. Furthermore, the vector
was adapted for convenient ligation-free transfer
of microRNA cassettes from public libraries. This
conditional knockdown-system should prove useful
for many research and gene therapeutic applications.
INTRODUCTION
RNA interference is a process which leads to degradation
of endogenous mRNA via formation of duplexes with small
non-coding RNAs. The application of RNA interference has
revolutionized the functional analysis of genes and may
also facilitate gene therapeutic approaches (1–5). Several dif-
ferent strategies have been devised to achieve RNA inter-
ference in cells. For example, synthetic short interfering
RNAs (siRNA) of 21 nt can be efficiently transfected
into cells. Alternatively, transfection of plasmids encoding
shRNAs (short hairpin), which are processed to siRNAs by
the enzyme DROSHA, is commonly used. It is possible to
achieve up to 90% reduction in expression of the respective
protein by RNA interference. Transiently introduced siRNAs
are effective for up to 5 days as they are degraded with
time and diluted during cell divisions. For permanent gene
inactivation it is necessary to stably integrate plasmids driv-
ing the expression of shRNAs into the genome of the res-
pective target cell. Initially, RNA polymerase III (Pol III)
promoters were used to mediate permanent shRNA expres-
sion (6). Recently, Pol II promoters have been employed to
drive the expression of precursor microRNAs (7). The con-
stitutive expression of siRNAs may however compete with
endogenous microRNAs, leading to toxic side effects.
For the biochemical and functional analysis of essential
genes conditional approaches are necessary. Furthermore,
the analysis of isogenic cell populations which only differ
in the activation state of a conditional allele has advantages
when compared to the analysis of cells permanently express-
ing a knock-down construct. In the latter case multiple clones
obtained by tedious single cell cloning and expansion have to
be analyzed to avoid clonal variations. In addition, the long-
term down-regulation of proteins by stable knock-down
strategies may lead to compensatory activation of parallel
pathways, obscuring the initial effect of the gene-specific
inactivation. Therefore, the conditional activation of
microRNA expression provides significant advantages.
Although a number of systems for conditional gene expres-
sion have been developed, the Tet-repressor system was most
widely applied in recent years (8). In this system elements
of the bacterial tet operon were transferred into mammalian
cells: the tet-repressor was fused to the VP16 transactivation
domain (tTA). In the presence of tetracycline or its derivative
doxycycline (DOX) this fusion protein will not bind a pro-
moter which harbors a tet-repressor binding site. Later a mut-
ant tet-VP16 fusion was developed which only binds to DNA
in the presence of DOX (rTA, reverse tetracycline controlled
transactivator) (9). In many cases the leakiness of the regu-
lated promoters has presented a problem. This can be avoided
by the simultaneous expression of a tet-repressor fused to
the KRAB protein (tTSKRAB), which keeps the inducible
gene inactive in the absence of doxycycline (10). Bornkamm
et al. (11) combined recently the rTA and tTSKRAB in the
episomal pRTS-1 vector, which allows conditional expres-
sion of cDNAs in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate
that the pRTS-1 vector can be used to conditionally regulate
the expression of microRNAs mediating RNA-interference,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines/culture and reagents
U2OS osteosarcoma cells were maintained in DMEM con-
taining 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100IE)/
streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Doxycycline (Sigma) was resolved
in water (1 mg/ml). Etoposide was resolved in DMSO (40
mg/ml) and used at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml.
Poly(I:C) (Sigma) was resolved in water (10 mg/ml) and
used at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml.
Generation of plasmids
For generation of the shuttle vector pSHUMI the oligos
pUC19linker-fw 50-AATTGGGCCTCACTGGCCACCGGA-
GATCTGTCGACGGACGCGTACCGGTG-30 and pUC19-
linker-rv 50-TCGACACCGGTACGCGTCCGTCGACAGA-
TCTCCGGTGGCCAGTGAGGCCC-30 were annealed and
inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pUC19 resulting in
pUC19m. A BglII/AgeI fragment containing miR30
sequences from the LMP plasmid (12) was inserted into the
BglII/AgeI sites of pUC19m. The resulting pSHUMI plasmid
can be used to subclone short hairpin sequences using the
XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites.
For generation of the pEMI vector, regions containing
50miR30 and homology region 2 (HR2) were amplified from
pSM2c (7) using the primers 50miR30-frw 50-CGAGATC-
TTGTTTGAATGAGGCTTCAGTAC-30 and 50miR30-rev
50-GCACCGGTGCGGCCGCCTCGAGCCTTCTGTTGGGT-
TAACC-30 and HR2-frw 50-CGCTCGAGATCCATGGCA-
TATGGGATCCAAGGCAGTTATTGGTGCCCTTAAAC-30
HR2-rev 50-GCACCGGTTCAGATCCTCTTCGGAGATCAG-30
and inserted into the pTOPO vector (Invitrogen). The
50miR30 part was subcloned into pSHUMI using BglII/
AgeI restriction sites and the HR2 region was introduced
using XhoI/AgeI restriction sites. The PheS expressing
cassette was released from pBSPheS (13) using NcoI/BglII
and ligated between the 50miR30 and HR2 sequences into
the NcoI/BamHI sites. From the resulting vector a fragment
containing the 50miR30/PheS/HR2 region was released by
SfiI and inserted into the SfiI sites of pRTS-1 resulting in
pEMI (plasmid for episomal microRNA expression).
Restriction mediated microRNA transfer
A p53-specific hairpin was released from pSM2c (Oligo ID:
v2HS_93615, current accession: NM_000546) (7) using
XhoI/EcoRI and inserted into pSHUMI. A MAD2-specific
microRNA was generated in a two-step PCR: the primers
forward 50-tgctgttgacagtgagcgCTGGGAAGAGTCGGGAC-
CACAGtagtgaagccacagatg-30 and reverse 50-tccgaggcagtag-
gcaATGGGAAGAGTCGGGACCACAGtacatctgtggcttcac-30
were annealed, extended by PCR and amplified using
universal miR30XhoI/EcoRI primers (miR30Xho I Fw,
50-CAGAAGGCTCGAGAAGGTATATTGCTGTTGACAG-
TGAGCG-30; miR30EcoR I Rv, 50-CTAAAGTAGCCCCTT-
GAATTCCGAGGCAGTAGGCA-30. The resulting fragment
was cut with XhoI and EcoRI and inserted into pSHUMI.
The SfiI fragments from pSHUMI containing the microRNA
cassettes were inserted into pRTS-1.
Mating-assisted genetically integrated cloning
(MAGIC)
Ligation-free gene transfer using the MAGIC system
was done essentially as described (13). In brief, the donor
bacterial strain (DH10bF0DOT sbcC, PIR1 positive) was
transformed with a p53-specific pSM2c vector and grown
on kanamycin (30 mg/ml) containing Luria–Bertani (LB)
plates at 37C. The recipient strain (BW287051/pML300)
was transformed with the recipient vector pEMI and grown
in the presence of 100 mg/ml carbenicilin, 50 mg/ml spectino-
mycin and 0.2% (w/v) glucose on LB plates at 30C. Donor
and recipient colonies were used to inoculate overnight liquid
cultures. The recipient bacteria were washed twice with LB.
Both donor and recipient bacteria were diluted 1:50 with LB/
0.2% (w/v) rhamnose and grown at 30C until an OD600 of
0.15–0.25. The bacteria were mixed for conjugation in the
presence of 0.2% (w/v) L-arabinose and incubated at 37C
for 2 h without and for 2 h with agitation. Recombinant
bacteria were plated on a selection plate containing of chlor-
amphenicol (30 mg/ml), carbenicilin (100 mg/ml) and 10 mM
DL-p-chlorophenylalanine and incubated at 42C overnight.
Recombination events were detected by colony PCR using
the primers [CmR-frw, 50-CCGTTTGTGATGGCTTCCA-
TGTC-30 (corresponding to the chloramphenicol resistance)
and pEMI-rev 50-AATCAAGGGTCCCCAAACTC-30
(matching to pEMI)].
Generation of cell pools
U2OS osteosarcoma cells were transfected by lipofection
with pEMI-plasmids using FuGene reagents (Roche) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, cells were
selected in media containing 150 mg/ml hygromycin for
7 days. Homogenicity of the selected cell pools was tested
by addition of 100 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h and mono-
meric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-fluorescence detection.
DNA content analysis by FACS
U2OS (5 · 104) were plated into T25 cell culture flasks.
Floating cells and trypsinized cells were collected by cen-
trifugation at 1700 r.p.m. (600 g) for 7 min, cells were
fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol and stored over night on
ice. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
1 ml FACS solution [PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 60 mg/ml pro-
pidium iodide (PI) and 0.5 mg/ml DNase free RNase] was
added per sample and incubated at room temperature for
30 min. DNA content was determined by propidium iodide
staining (FACSCalibur, Becton-Dickinson).
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and complete mini protease inhi-
bitors (Roche)]. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at
13 000 r.p.m. (16 060 g) for 15 min at 4C. Per lane 30 mg
of whole cell lysate was loaded on 12% SDS–acrylamide
gels, separated and transfered on Immobilon PVDF mem-
branes (Millipore corporation, MA). For immunodetection

membranes were incubated with antibodies specific for p53
(DO-1; Santa Cruz), p21 (Ab-11; NeoMarkers), Mad2
(Clone 48, BD Biosciences) and b-actin (A-2066; Sigma).
HRP (horse-radish peroxidase)-coupled secondary antibodies
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin
Elmer Life Sciences, Boston).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
After treatment of U2OS with 100 ng/ml doxycycline or
transfection with poly(I:C) (Sigma), total RNA was isolated
(Total RNA Isolation System; Promega, Madison, USA).
cDNA was generated from 1 mg total RNA per sample
using anchored oligo-dT primers (Reverse-iT First Strand
Synthesis; ABgene). qPCR was performed by using the
LightCycler (Roche) and the FastStart DNA Master SYBR
Green 1 kit (Roche Applied Science). The following primer
sets were used: IFIT1, 50-GCCATTTTCTTTGCTTCCCCTA-30
and 50-TGCCCTTTTGTAGCCTCCTTG-30; b-actin, 50-tgac-
attaaggagaagctgtgctac-30 and 50-gagttgaaggtagtttcgtggatg-30;
Mad2-specific-microRNA, 50-GATGTACTGTGGTCCCGA-
CTCT-30 and 50-TCAAAGAGATAGCAAGGTATTCAGT-30.
The generation of specific PCR products was confirmed
by melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis (data not
shown). Fold inductions were calculated as described pre-
viously (14) with standardization using b-actin.

RESULTS
Construction of episomal vectors for RNAi
Recently, comprehensive libraries of microRNAs which were
designed to facilitate the RNA interference mediated down-
regulation of all human or mouse genes have been described
(7). These microRNAs are publicly available and are pro-
vided in the pSHAG-MAGIC 2c (pSM2c) retroviral vector
(http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/RNAi), which provides constitutive
expression driven by a long-terminal repeat (LTR). Here, we
have chosen several microRNA cassettes from the human
library for transfer from pSM2c vectors to the pRTS-1 vector.
Since pRTS is a relatively large vector (18 kb) the inter-
mediate pUC19-based shuttle vector pSHUMI (plasmid for
shuttling microRNAs) is necessary for the transfer procedure
(Figure 1). For a faster transfer of microRNAs we also
adapted the pRTS vector to the ligation-free MAGIC tech-
nique (mating-assisted genetically integrated cloning) (13).
The resulting pEMI (plasmid for episomal microRNA expres-
sion; Figure 1) harbors a pheS Gly294 allele encoding a
tRNA synthase for phenylalanine with relaxed specificity,
which incorporates toxic chloro-phenylalanine and thereby
facilitates selection against non-recombinant clones. Bacteria

containing the pEMI-recipient vector were conjugated with
bacteria containing a pSM2c vector encoding a p53-specific
microRNA. Of 80 resulting bacterial colonies 79 (98.7%)
harbored pEMI vectors containing the p53-microRNA
as determined by colony PCR (data not shown). Successful
recombination was also confirmed by restriction and
sequence analysis (data not shown).
Functional evaluation of pEMI vectors
The human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS was transfected
with pEMI vectors encoding either p53- or MAD2-specific
or non-silencing microRNAs, which do not recognize any
human mRNA. Selection for cells containing the pEMI
vectors with hygromycin B was completed within 7 days.
The resulting pools of resistant cells were analyzed for
RT–PCR analysis to determine the expression of the ectopic
microRNA after addition of doxycycline (DOX) (Figure 2a).
In the absence of DOX no MAD2-specific microRNA was
detected after 30 PCR cycles. However, 24 h after addition
of DOX the microRNA was expressed. By 48 h the expres-
sion increased further as determined by quantitative PCR
(data not shown). As no microRNA expression was detected
in the absence of DOX, these results show that the pEMI vec-
tors mediate an extremely stringent control over microRNA
expression. In line with this observation the cell pools were
consistently devoid of mRFP expression in the absence
of DOX as determined by live cell fluorescence microscopy
(Figure 2b). Within 24 h after addition of DOX approxi-
mately half of the cells were positive for mRFP at
3.2 ng/ml DOX and virtually all cells were positive at
25 ng/ml (Figure 2b). Even at only 0.8 ng/ml DOX a decrease
in p53 protein levels was observed within 24 h (Figure 2c). At
a DOX concentration of 25 ng/ml the degree of p53 down-
regulation and frequency of mRFP-positive cells reached
its maximum and p53 protein was hardly detectable. Similar
results were obtained with microRNAs specific for MAD2,
although the maximal down-regulation of MAD2 was
reached at higher DOX-concentrations, presumably due to
the different half-lives of p53 and MAD2 or varying effi-
ciencies of the respective microRNAs. Induction of a non-
silencing microRNA did not affect the levels of p53 protein.
In a time course analysis the level of p53 protein began to
decrease one day after induction of the p53 microRNA
(Figure 3a). At 5 ng/ml DOX the maximum knock-down
was reached after 2–3 days. After a 48 h exposure to DOX,
its removal led to complete restoration of p53 expression
within 6 days which was paralleled by the disappearance of
mRFP as determined by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3b).
When p53 was activated by treatment with the DNA dam-
aging agent etoposide, an increase in the levels of p53 and its
target p21 was observed within 3.5 h (Figure 4a). Induction
of the p53-specific microRNA 2 days before etoposide addi-
tion resulted in strong suppression of p53 and prevented
any significant increase in p53 and p21 protein after DNA
damage. A control cell population expressing a non-silencing
microRNA showed normal stabilization of p53 and p21
induction after addition of etoposide (Figure 4a). Further-
more, a flow cytometric analysis revealed that suppression
of p53 inhibited arrest in the G1 phase upon etoposide treat-
ment, whereas in the absence of p53-specific microRNAs,
or upon expression of the non-silencing microRNA cells
arrested normally (Figure 4b).
As an example for the inactivation of an essential gene by
the system introduced here we conditionally down-regulated
the expression of the MAD2 protein, which was shown to
result in mitotic failure and extensive cell death when perma-
nently inactivated (15,16). After introduction of the pEMI-
plasmid encoding a MAD2-specific microRNA we observed
no effect on the viability and cell cycle distribution. Only
when MAD2 was down-regulated by addition of DOX an

increased fraction of apoptotic cells and altered cell cycle
distribution was observed (data not shown). These results
show that the expression of microRNAs can be tightly con-
trolled using pEMI vectors, which are therefore useful for
studying essential genes.
To rule out toxic side effects mediated by the pEMI vector-
driven microRNA expression, we analyzed the expression of
the IFIT1 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide
repeats 1) gene by qPCR. Others have shown that expression
of IFIT1 mRNA is rapidly induced upon IFN treatment (17).

Besides interferon, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and viral
infection have been shown to increase the expression
of IFIT1 (18). pEMI-driven expression of a non-silencing
microRNA for 2 and 4 days did not provoke an increased
IFIT1 expression (Figure 5). Also expression of a p53-
specific microRNA did not lead to any increase in IFIT1
expression, whereas transfection of U2OS cells with a syn-
thetic dsRNA [poly(I:C)] led to 40-fold increase in IFIT1
mRNA expression within 18 h after transfection. Incubation
of U2OS cells in media containing poly(I:C) also increased
the level of IFIT1 up to 7-fold (data not shown) indicating
this cell line is in principle very sensitive towards the pre-
sence of dsRNA. Furthermore, proliferation assays showed
no significant anti-proliferative effect of pEMI-driven
microRNA over-expression and cells were viable for several
weeks when expressing microRNAs not targeting essential
genes, whereas treatment with poly(I:C) led to an apoptotic
response 2 days post transfection presumably by activating
the dsRNA response (data not shown). Taken together,
expression of ectopic microRNA by pEMI vectors does not
lead to a dsRNA response or other toxic side effects.
DISCUSSION
A number of different conditional systems for RNA inter-
ference have been described previously (12, 19–26). They
utilize tetracycline regulation or CRE-recombinase mediated
activation of shRNAs or microRNAs). However, they rely on
several separate plasmids providing the necessary regulators
in trans. One major advantage of the system described in
this manuscript lies in the possibility to establish cells
exhibiting inducible knock-down of the gene/protein of inter-
est in one step as all components have been integrated on a
single vector. This feature facilitates the analysis of cells
which are characterized by a low transfection efficiency or
a limited life span which presumably applies to most primary
cells. With this vector system we could generate cell pools
which homogenously express the microRNA of interest in
an inducible manner in only one week. Furthermore, the anal-
ysis is not restricted to a cell clone expressing the trans-
regulator (tTA or CRE) at the appropriate level. Instead, a
pool of different cells expressing the pEMI vector can be ana-
lyzed. Obviously, this provides significant advantages and
protects against misleading clonal effects.
The vector system employed here is episomal and therefore
microRNA expression levels are not dependent on the site
of integration. Furthermore, the combination of a repressor
and an activator acting through the tet-operon prevents
expression in the off-state and allows precise titration of the
expression level of the respective microRNA. Our determina-
tion of ectopic microRNA expression validate this point,
as we were unable to detect expression in the uninduced
state. The pEMI vector allows the conditional knockdown
of proteins within a short period without the need for viral
infection procedures or repeated transfections of several plas-
mids encoding the different components of the system. The
expression of a fluorescent protein from the bidirectional
promoter allows transfected cells to be sorted by flow
cytometry, circumventing single cell cloning. Furthermore,
cells exhibiting RNA interference can be traced in a hetero-
geneous population of cells in cell culture or in animals. In
addition, the fluorescent protein marker facilitates the detec-
tion of any potential loss of microRNA expression in a cell
population. Therefore, laborious, parallel analyses to confirm
microRNA expression or its effects on the targeted gene are
not necessary for every experiment. A further useful feature
of this system is the possibility to reverse the knockdown
and hence the induced phenotype. Thereby the causal link
between the knockdown of any gene and the observed pheno-
type can be strengthened as non-reversible phenotypes may
represent secondary effects.
We observed different degrees of inducibility over time
in different cell lines. Whereas U2OS and H1299 cells
showed a decrease of inducibility after 4 weeks of passaging,
MCF7 cells did not show any decrease in the frequency
of inducible (mRFP-positive) cells after several month of
propagation. Cells which show loss of expression after con-
tinued passaging should therefore be conserved by freezing
at early passages.
Mammalian cells discriminate between microRNAs that
are endogenous DICER products and non-self dsRNAs,
e.g. by-products of viral replication (27). The microRNAs
which were used here are embedded in an authentic human
miRNA miR30 (28). This human microRNA has been shown
to be efficiently recognized and processed by the Drosha–
DGCR8 complex and DICER in mammalian cells (28) and
therefore should not induce non-specific effects that are trig-
gered by viral dsRNAs, as, for example, activation of the
interferon pathway. A commonly used and sensitive marker
for the activation of these dsRNA signaling pathways leading
to IRF-3 and IFN induction is the increased expression of the

tricopeptide repeats 1) expression after induction of microRNAs or treatment
with poly(I:C). U2OS pools were treated with 100 ng/ml DOX for the
indicated time periods to induce non-silencing or a p53-specific microRNA
driven by pEMI vector. As a positive control for IFIT1 gene induction, U2OS
cells were transfected with poly(I:C) dsRNA (IC) or subjected to a mock
transfection (C) for 18 h. Shown are the relative expression levels of IFIT1
normalized to b-actin expression. IFIT1 expression levels in untreated or
MOCK transfected cells were set to 1. All experiments were performed in
triplicates. Error bars indicate standard deviations.

dsRNA induced protein 56K (p56) encoded by the IFIT1
(interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1)
gene (18,29–31). Expression of p56 has furthermore been clo-
sely linked to the general toxicity of distinct siRNA duplexes
(27). We found that neither non-silencing microRNA nor a
p53-specific microRNA expressed by the episomal pEMI
vector triggered a dsRNA pathway response.
The controlled inactivation of genes by the system intro-
duced here may be useful in certain therapeutic regimes
and prevent the potential toxicity or immunogenicity which
has been discussed for therapeutic applications of ectopic
RNA interference. Using the bi-directional promoter it may
be possible to express an RNA interference resistant wild-
type protein to substitute for a mutant protein, which is simul-
taneously down-regulated by the ectopic microRNA. A simi-
lar approach has been recently described for the treatment of
sickle cell anemia (32). As described above the pEMI vector
is compatible with recently generated microRNA libraries
and will therefore presumably become a widely used tool
for conditional RNA interference (7).
