[1] This study examined daily, seasonal, and interannual variations in CH4 emissions at a
temperate peatland over a 5-year period. We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange
(NEE), CH4 flux, water table depth, peat temperature, and meteorological parameters
weekly from the summers (1 May to 31 August) of 2000 through 2004 at Sallie’s Fen
in southeastern New Hampshire, United States. Significant interannual differences,
driven by high variability of large individual CH4 fluxes (ranging from 8.7 to 3833.1 mg
CH4 m
2 d1) occurring in the late summer, corresponded with a decline in water
table level and an increase in air and peat temperature. Monthly timescale yielded the
strongest correlations between CH4 fluxes and peat and air temperature (r
2 = 0.78 and
0.74, respectively) and water table depth (WTD) (r2 = 0.53). Compared to daily and
seasonal timescales, the monthly timescale was the best timescale to predict CH4 fluxes
using a stepwise multiple regression (r2 = 0.81). Species composition affected
relationships between CH4 fluxes and measures of plant productivity, with sedge collars
showing the strongest relationships between CH4 flux, water table, and temperature. Air
temperature was the only variable that was strongly correlated with CH4 flux at all
timescales, while WTD had either a positive or negative correlation depending on
timescale and vegetation type. The timescale dependence of controls on CH4 fluxes has
important implications for modeling.

1. Introduction
[2] Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas with 62 times the
global warming potential (GWP) of carbon dioxide at
20 year timescales [Houghton et al., 2001]. Wetlands
comprise the largest and most variable source of CH4
released to the atmosphere. Wetlands store approximately
one-third of global soil carbon as peat [Alm et al., 1997;
Gorham, 1991], which has the potential to be released to the
atmosphere with higher temperatures and changing water
table levels [Carroll and Crill, 1997; Houghton et al., 2001;
Roulet et al., 1992].
[3] Many studies have found that differences in peat
temperature and water table position affect CH4 emissions
both within a site and over a range of wetland types [e.g.,
Bubier et al., 1995; Moore and Dalva, 1993; Updegraff,
2001], while others have found that substrate availability
and temperature are the strongest determinants of this
variation [Christensen et al., 2003a]. Seasonal average
water table has been proposed as a predictor of CH4
emissions across a wide range of sites [Bubier, 1995; Dise
et al., 1993; Moore and Roulet, 1993; Waddington et al.,
1996].
[4] Higher CH4 emissions have been observed coincident
with water table levels at or near the peat surface [Aerts and
Ludwig, 1997; Bubier, 1995; Dise et al., 1993; Moore and
Dalva, 1997]. Others have reported opposite or insignificant
trends during periods of low water table position or when
the average water table was within 15 cm of the peat surface
[Bellisario et al., 1999; Kettunen et al., 1996; Moosavi and
Crill, 1997; Shannon and White, 1994; Yavitt et al., 1993].
This is possible because of the decrease in overlying
hydrostatic pressure causing the release of stored CH4
induced by either a water table drop or a change in
barometric pressure [Glaser et al., 2004; Rosenberry et
al., 2003; Strack et al., 2004].
[5] Plant productivity influences CH4 production by
providing substrate from root exudates [Joabsson et al.,
1999; King et al., 2002; O¨quist and Svensson, 2002; Stro¨m
et al., 2003]. CH4 fluxes have been correlated with vascular
plant biomass [Bellisario et al., 1999; Christensen et al.,
2003b; King et al. 1998; Whiting et al., 1991], species
composition [Bubier, 1995; Joabsson and Christensen,
2001], net ecosystem productivity (NEP) across a variety
of wetlands with water table levels at or near the soil surface

[Waddington et al., 1996; Whiting and Chanton, 1993] and
net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) [Bellisario et al., 1999;
Joabsson and Christensen, 2001]. CH4 fluxes have also been
linked to photosynthesis, especially in wet sites [Joabsson et
al., 1999; King and Reeburgh, 2002; Nyka¨nen et al., 2003;
Stro¨m et al., 2003]. Ecosystem respirationmay also be related
to CH4 fluxes as both CO2 and CH4 are products of
decomposition, and both gases are constrained by the same
physical factors of gas phase exchange. Few studies have
documented the dynamics among plant productivity, NEE,
species composition and CH4 fluxes on different timescales.
[6] We examined the links among CH4 fluxes and phys-
ical (e.g., water table, air, and peat temperature) and
biological variables (e.g., NEE, photosynthesis, respiration,
and plant species composition) across a variety of temporal
and spatial scales. While several studies have taken this
integrative approach to looking at CH4 fluxes, most have
been limited to one or two growing seasons [Bellisario et
al., 1999; Bubier et al., 2005; Frolking and Crill, 1994;
Heikkinen et al., 2004; Waddington et al., 1996]. Here we
present 5 years of CH4, NEE, air and peat temperature, and
water table measurements at Sallie’s Fen in New Hamp-
shire, USA. We compared differences among years, as well
as within years and between plant communities.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Site Description
[7] Sallie’s Fen is a temperate peatland located in Bar-
rington, New Hampshire, USA (4312.50N, 713.50W),
approximately 20 km from Durham, New Hampshire. It is
a mineral poor fen of approximately 1.7 ha that receives
most of its water from runoff, rainfall and a small ephemeral
stream [Melloh and Crill, 1996]. The pH ranges from 4.1 to
5.7. The fen receives an average of 1100 mm of precipita-
tion annually. The annual average temperature is 8.1C and
the average annual growing season temperature is 17.1C
[Frolking and Crill, 1994]. The biologically active season
lasts from late April through October with plant senescence
beginning in late August. The dominant vegetation of the
fen is composed of Sphagnum mosses in the ground layer,
with evergreen shrub leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calycu-
lata) and deciduous shrubs alder (Alnus incana spp. rugosa)
and blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum and V. angustifo-
lium), sedges (Carex rostrata and C. aquatilus), cranberry
(Vaccinium oxyccocus) and bog lily (Maianthemum trifolia)
in the shrub and herbaceous layers. A few red maple trees
(Acer rubrum) line the edges of the fen.
2.2. Net Ecosystem CO2 Exchange Measurements
[8] We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE),
respiration and CH4 fluxes at 10 locations within the fen on
a weekly basis from 1 May through 31 August 2000–2004.
The sampling sites span a range of heights above the water
table and vegetation types (Table 1). NEE was measured
using the static chamber method described by Carroll and
Crill [1997]. The transparent chamber enclosed 0.401 m3,
and consisted of an aluminum frame covered on three sides
with 1.27 mm Teflon FEP film, while the fourth side and
removable lid were made with 3.2 mm Lexan. The Teflon
and Lexan used in the chambers reduced incident photo-
synthetically active radiation (PAR) less than 10%
(P. Czepiel, personal communication, 1997). The chamber
had three 12 V brushless muffin fans for circulating the air
within the chamber across a heat exchanger through which
ice water was circulated on sunny, hot days in order to
maintain headspace temperature to within 1C of ambient.
The climate control system also kept relative humidity low
enough to prevent condensation from forming on the
chamber walls. The chambers were placed on aluminum
collars (63 cm  63 cm) permanently embedded 10–15 cm
into the peat surface with a groove for chamber placement
and sealing with water. We recorded the air temperature,
peat temperature at a depth of 10 cm and the pH of the
surface water during each flux measurement.
[9] CO2 concentrations were measured for a period of
2 min using a LICOR-6200 photosynthesis system (LiCor
Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska), which included an LI-6250 infrared
gas analyzer, data logger, PAR sensor and sensor head with
thermocouples and a relative humidity sensor. NEE was
calculated from the change in headspace CO2 concentration
over the measurement period and was corrected for moisture
fluxes using methods described by Hooper et al. [2002].
[10] In order to define a photosynthetic light response
curve, NEE was measured at four light levels; at full light
and using shrouds to block approximately half, three-quar-

ters, and all PAR. Because of the uncertainties in quantifying
net ecosystem production fromweekly chamber CO2 data for
the whole growing season [Bubier et al., 1999] and uncer-
tainties in measuring NEE at low light levels using shade
cloths [Burrows et al., 2005], we used gross photosynthesis
at full light (PSNmax = net ecosystem CO2 flux at PAR >
1000 mmol photons m2 s1 minus respiration) as an
estimate of maximum plant productivity. NEEmeasurements
with a relative humidity greater than 80% were discarded
because of plant stress leading to observed decreased rates of
photosynthesis. The dark measurement of NEE using the
shroud to block all light from entering the chamber was
considered ameasure of ecosystem respiration. Although this
technique overestimates nighttime respiration due to higher
chamber temperatures, our goal was to measure daytime CO2
respiration and CH4 flux simultaneously.
2.3. CH4 Flux Measurements
[11] CH4 flux measurements were made during the dark
chamber run during and after the respiration measurements to
avoid changes in temperature during the necessarily longer
enclosure times. Five headspace samples were taken every
2 min from the chamber for a 10-min period with 60 ml
polypropylene syringes equipped with polycarbonate/nylon
stopcocks. We also sampled the concentration of CH4 equil-
ibrated with pore water at 10 cm depth. This was accom-
plished by extracting pore water in the field, returning the
syringes to the laboratory to equilibrate to room temperature.
The syringes were filled with 30 ml of pore water and 30 ml
of room air then shaken by hand for 2 min immediately prior
to analysis. Mixing ratios of CH4 in both chamber headspace
and pore water samples were determined by analysis with a
gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector
(GC-FID, Shimadzu GC-14A). Ultra High Purity Nitrogen
(UHPN2) carried the sample through an analytical separation
column of 2 m  1/1600 OD stainless steel packed with
HayeSepQ held isothermally at 50C. Mixing ratios were
determined by comparing sample peak areas with breathing
air standards calibrated with NOAA ESRL Global Monitor-
ing Laboratory’s Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group
(formerly CMDL). Precision for this analysis was ±0.5%.
Fluxes were calculated using a linear regression of the change
in CH4 mixing ratios over the 10-min period. The coefficient
of determination had to be significant to the 95% confidence
limit for n = 3 (r2 = 0.95), n = 4 (r2 = 0.87), or n = 5 (r2 = 0.75);
otherwise the sample was rejected. Approximately 17% of
CH4 fluxes were discarded using these criteria, but the mean
of the discarded fluxes was not significantly different from
the sample mean. Low CH4 flux rates were included if they
were significantly different than 0. The chamber was vented
prior to starting the CH4 flux measurement period, and only
fluxes with the initial concentrations near ambient were used
in the analyses to ensure that disturbance was not a factor.
2.4. Environmental Variables
[12] Meteorological and water table data were collected
continuously at Sallie’s Fen using an automated meteoro-
logical (MET) station. Hourly average MET data and daily
average water table data were used in the analyses. During
periods when meteorological data were unavailable, we
used air temperature and precipitation data from a weather
station in Durham, New Hampshire, approximately 20 km
away. Daily water table data were linearly interpolated
between manual well measurements from 7 June to 6 July
2003 when continuous well measurements were unavailable
(S. Frolking, personal communication, 2004). Water table
depths (WTD) were calibrated using manual measurements
of water table depth relative to the peat surface for all years.
Depth to water table from the peat surface for each collar
was determined using a tube level in August 2004 (Table 1).
We measured WTD and air and peat temperature at each
collar at the same time we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes.
[13] Plant species composition and biomass estimates of
each collar were made during August 2003. Species com-
position was measured using a quadrat and visually esti-
mating percent coverage within the collar. Biomass
estimates were derived from counting stem height and
number of each species within the collar using algorithms
from previous studies at the site [Burrows et al., 2005]. We
divided sites into two main vegetation groups determined by
collar species composition and biomass (Table 1): sedge
(primarily Carex rostrata) and leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne
calyculata). The leatherleaf collars were designated as the
three collars with the highest leatherleaf biomass (collars 6,
2, 11). Sedge collars were those with the highest percentage
of sedge biomass (collars 5, 7, 8).
2.5. Data Analysis
[14] For analysis, NEE, photosynthesis and respiration
are considered metrics of plant and microbial activity, while
air temperature, peat temperature and water table depth data
are referred to as environmental measurements. Throughout
the manuscript we adopt the convention that CO2 and CH4
fluxes to the atmosphere are positive and CO2 uptake by the
ecosystem is negative.
[15] We examined relationships between the independent
variables and CH4 flux on a seasonal scale using individual
fluxes (representing the measurement period), monthly
means across all collars, and the seasonal means for
individual collars and all collars combined, in individual
years and combined data from all years (grouped years). A
natural log transformation was used on the CH4 flux data to
reduce skewness and to approximate a normal distribution
for all analyses.
[16] SPSS 12.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.) was
used for statistical analyses. One-way ANOVA tests were
conducted at a = 0.05 (two-tailed) to determine differences
between the independent variables in different years, as well
as differences between collars. A Bonferroni post hoc
analysis was used to determine where differences occurred
between the groups. We used regressions (a = 0.05) to
determine the relationships between independent variables
and CH4 fluxes. Stepwise multiple regressions (a = 0.05)
for three different timescales included parameters for NEE,
maximum photosynthesis, respiration, air and peat temper-
ature, and water table level. Variables that were not statis-
tically significant were omitted from the reported results of
the multiple regression analyses.
3. Results
3.1. Environmental Conditions
[17] Mean summer air temperature at Sallie’s Fen ranged
from 15.8C in 2004 to 18.3C in 2001, with July and

August usually the warmest months (Table 2). The seasonal
mean air temperatures were lower at Sallie’s Fen than the
30-year climate normals at Durham, New Hampshire,
probably due to differences in microclimate from topo-
graphic differences and effects of surrounding trees. Water
table level fell over the course of the summer, starting at 5–
10 cm below the peat surface in early May and falling to
15–55 cm below the peat surface by the end of August
(Figure 1). Monthly mean depths ranged from 3 cm below
the peat surface in June 2001, the year with the highest
mean water table, to as much as 45 cm below peat surface in
August 2002, the driest year in our study (Table 2).
[18] Interannual variability in water table position was
determined by both the total amount of precipitation and the
timing. In 2001, Sallie’s Fen received 286.8 mm of precip-
itation during the growing season, with the majority falling
in June and July, resulting in the water table staying near the
peat surface (Figure 1). The water table fell dramatically in
2002 despite receiving 330.5 mm of precipitation over the
season because the rainfall was concentrated in the months
of May and June with less than 60 mm falling in July and
August (Table 2).
3.2. NEE, Photosynthesis, and Respiration
[19] Maximum NEE (at PAR > 1000 mmol photons m2
s1) gradually increased through midseason, then declined
toward the end of the season. The components of NEE,
photosynthesis and respiration followed a similar trend but
with respiration initially lagging NEE and photosynthesis
(data not shown). Individual NEE fluxes ranged from
0.6 mmol CO2 m
2 s1 to a peak value of 14.5 mmol CO2
m2 s1. Photosynthesis ranged from 3.8 to 22.2 mmol
CO2 m
2 s1 and respiration ranged from 1.3 to 12.9 mmol

indicated significant differences among seasons for photosyn-
thesis (F (4, 382) = 3.831, p = 0.005) and at a monthly level
for NEE and photosynthesis in June and for respiration in July
(Table 3).
3.3. CH4 Fluxes
[20] CH4 fluxes increased in magnitude and variability
during the season in all years (Figure 2), ranging from an
efflux of 8.7 to 3833.1 mg CH4 m
2 d1. The seasonal
increase in flux is linear and normally distributed when
logarithmically transformed (results not shown). Results of a
one-way ANOVA (a = 0.01) indicated significant differences
among all years (F = 4.180, d.f. = 4, 382, p = 0.003; Figure 3),
which were greatest during the month of August. Years
2002 and 2000 had the highest (423 mg CH4 m
2 d1) and
lowest (204 mg CH4 m
2 d1) seasonal average CH4 flux,
respectively (Table 3).
[21] The strength and sign of the correlations between
CH4 flux and the suite of abiotic and biotic variables varied
by timescale (minutes, months, seasons; Table 4). There
were significant linear relationships (a = 0.05) between
individual CH4 flux measurements and each of the inde-
pendent variables except NEE. Peat temperature, air tem-
perature and respiration showed the strongest correlations
with individual CH4 fluxes (r
2 = 0.12, 0.11, 0.10 respec-
tively). CH4 fluxes increased significantly with a decline in
water table in several individual years and in combined
years (Figure 4), with the regressions having similar slope
of 0.02 to 0.03 each year. In 2002, CH4 flux increased with
greater WTD at all locations except collar 6 (the driest
hummock), where fluxes decreased with a falling water
table (Figure 4). CH4 fluxes were positively correlated with
air temperature in individual years (2000–2003) and weak-
ly correlated in all 5 years combined. Peat temperature had a
slightly stronger positive relationship with CH4 fluxes than
air temperature (r2 = 0.12 versus 0.11) in grouped years.
CH4 fluxes increased significantly with higher rates of
respiration in both individual and grouped years (Table 4).
A stepwise multiple regression revealed that factors differed
in importance depending on the timescale. The strongest
predictive model included monthly means of air temperature
and WTD, explaining 81% of variability in CH4 fluxes
(Table 5).
3.4. Collars and Vegetation Groups
[22] The 10 collars varied in species composition, bio-
mass, height above water table and location within the fen
(Table 1). Similarly, mean seasonal NEE, photosynthesis,
respiration and CH4 fluxes differed significantly among
collars when the years were combined (Table 1). Collars
3, 4 and 6 had the highest mean seasonal NEE (7.6 to
7.9 mmol CO2 m2 s1), respiration (7.2 to 7.5 mmol CO2
m2 s1) and photosynthesis (14.8 to 15.3 mmol CO2
m2 s1). Mean seasonal photosynthesis at these three
collars also differed significantly from all other collars while
respiration differed significantly from other locations except
collar 10. Collars 4 and 6 had the highest total biomass and
woody biomass, 1065 g m3 and 595 g m3, respectively.
Collar 1 had the highest seasonal mean CH4 flux for the
5 years combined (680.6 mg CH4 m
2 d1) while collar 7
had the lowest mean CH4 flux (181 mg CH4 m
2 d1).
Collars 1 and 7 also had the lowest amounts of total above

ground biomass but collar 1 was much wetter with a mean
water table position 17 cm above that of collar 7.
[23] The mean CH4 emission of the collars with the most
sedge biomass (collars 5, 7, 8) was 250.8 mg CH4 m
2 d1
and was not significantly different than the CH4 emission
from leatherleaf-dominated collars (6, 2, 11), 268.6 mg CH4
m2 d1 (p = 0.682). Mean respiration was significantly
higher at leatherleaf collars (5.77 mmol CO2 m
2 s1) than
sedge collars (5.08 mmol CO2 m
2 s1) using all years (p =
0.004), though the respiration was the same when considered
on a per gram of above ground biomass basis (0.02 mmol s1
g1). The water table at leatherleaf collars averaged 39.9 cm
below the peat surface, making them significantly drier than
sedge collars (36.3 cm, p = 0.007).
[24] At sedge collars, we found significant correlations
between individual CH4 fluxes and respiration, photosyn-
thesis, air and peat temperature, and water table depth for all
years combined (Table 4), as well as for 2000–2002. Sedge
collars had higher correlation coefficients between CH4
fluxes and each of the variables than leatherleaf collars
and all collars combined. CH4 fluxes at sedge collars were
positively correlated with water table level for the grouped
years, and showed the strongest correlation between two
variables of any group at the individual timescale (r2 =
0.31). Water table depth accounted for anywhere from 31%
of the variability of CH4 fluxes from sedge collars in all
years, to a maximum of 51% of the variability in 2000.
4. Discussion
4.1. Water Table Controls on CH4 Flux
[25] We expected a lower water table to produce lower
CH4 fluxes because the deeper water table level favors
aerobic respiration and CH4 oxidation [Aerts and Ludwig,
1997; Bubier et al., 1995; Dise et al., 1993; Moore and
Roulet, 1993]. We observed the opposite, a lower water
table associated with higher individual and monthly CH4
fluxes (Table 4 and Figure 5b). Bellisario et al. [1999] also
found inverse relationships from those expected between
water table level and CH4 flux. Most likely, the high CH4
fluxes we observed in the late season are due to a combined
effect of higher rates of CH4 production in warmer peats
and episodic fluxes of stored CH4. Bubble releases can be
produced by lowered pressure due to a falling water table
and changes in barometric pressure [Glaser et al., 2004;
Strack et al., 2005].
[26] When the water table drops, several conflicting
processes may be important: (1) the pressure gradient with
a subsequent release of stored CH4, (2) decreased CH4
production, and (3) increased or decreased CH4 oxidation.
Most collars showed the trend of increasing CH4 fluxes with
a falling water table with a coincident increase in temper-
ature, indicating that the lowering of the water table has a
larger influence on CH4 fluxes through changes in pressure
gradients and increased production due to warming than by
limiting microbial CH4 production and increasing oxidation.
There were no differences in the concentration of CH4
dissolved in pore water at 10 cm between months
(Table 3), suggesting that CH4 production is relatively
constant over the season despite a falling water table. Rather
than a direct link to water table level, CH4 fluxes may be
primarily related to peat temperature and secondarily to soil
moisture content rather than WTD, as has recently been
found with CO2 respiration in peatlands [Lafleur et al.,
2005]. We found that only the driest collar (#6) in the driest
year showed decreasing CH4 fluxes on an instantaneous
scale (Figure 4), indicating that there maybe a threshold soil
moisture content to switch off CH4 production. Additionally,
water table lowering and subsequent drying might more
severely dry and inhibit methanotrophs within water-hold-

ing Sphagnum moss hyaline cells [Raghoebarsing et al.,
2005; Basiliko et al., 2004].
[27] At the seasonal scale, we observed lower CH4 fluxes
at sites with lower water table levels, in contrast to the
individual or monthly measurement scale (Table 4). We
found stronger correlations between CH4 and WTD at the
seasonal scale in 2001 and 2003 (r = 0.64 for both) than
any yearly individual flux relationships (r ranged from 0.21
to 0.33; data not shown). The relationship between in-
creased WTD and decreased CH4 flux at the seasonal scale
is the generally observed pattern [Bubier et al., 1995; Dise
et al., 1993; Moore and Dalva, 1997; Waddington et al.,
1996] and suggests that over longer timescales than days or
weeks, the water table exerts a strong control on the extent
of anaerobiosis in the peat.
[28] The collar with the highest water table level, collar 1,
consistently showed the highest mean seasonal CH4 fluxes
(Table 1) indicating that average water table position
determines CH4 fluxes over a variety of sites. However,
as discussed above, there are also other factors that affect
fluxes on shorter timescales, e.g., this collar received the
least amount of sunlight, spending many mornings and late
afternoons in shade and consequently had a low plant
biomass. Higher CH4 fluxes from this wet site suggest that
water table, not plant productivity, controls CH4 fluxes.
4.2. Interannual Climate Variability
[29] We found that seasonal mean CH4 flux for the 5 years
combined showed a significant relationship only with air
temperature (Table 4), and in several individual years with
both WTD and temperature. However, in the cool and wet
years of 2000 and 2004, there were no significant relation-
ships between CH4 fluxes and any variables at a seasonal
scale. These 2 years had very similar water table dynamics
(Figure 1), with no large drop in water table (<20 cm), were
both cool (amean seasonal temperature of 16.7C in 2000 and
15.8C in 2004; Table 2) and had the lowest seasonal average
CH4 fluxes (Table 3). The combination of high water table
with continuing input of fresh water and low peat temperature
may have inhibited methanogenesis.
[30] 2002 was an exceptionally dry year in terms of the
seasonal mean water table level (Table 2). Precipitation was
high in the early season but water table was exceptionally
low by the end of August, falling to an average of 60 cm
below the peat surface and as much as 90 cm below the peat
surface at some measurement sites. In association with this
dry season, we measured the largest, most variable CH4
fluxes (Figure 3), probably owing to episodic fluxes and
other causes previously discussed. For these reasons, Au-
gust 2002 average flux was the highest monthly average in
the study.
4.3. Vegetation Control on CH4 Flux
[31] Mean seasonal methane fluxes from the sedge-
dominated and leatherleaf-dominated collars were not sig-
nificantly different despite differences in the physiology of
sedges that enhance CH4 flux by increasing transport and
bypassing the CH4 oxidation zone [King et al., 1998;
Shannon and White, 1994]. Relationships between CH4
fluxes and independent variables were much stronger in
the sedge collars than the leatherleaf collars (Table 4), and
were highly positively correlated with water table depth at
sedge collars. The largest flux measured in the whole study
was from a sedge collar in August 2002, 3811 mg CH4 m
2
d1, which increased the standard deviation of the average
flux from the sedge collars and illustrates the relative
importance of episodic fluxes at sedge-dominated sites.
[32] Somewhat surprisingly, CH4 fluxes from sedge collars
were not significantly correlated with plant productivity or
environmental variables in 2003 or 2004 even though these
years had the highest rates of NEE and photosynthesis. These
2 years also had the highest CO2 respiration measurements
and lower concentrations of dissolved CH4 in pore water at
10cm. Compared with other years, the proportion of carbon
emitted as aerobic respiration was much larger than that
produced through anaerobic respiration, perhaps because of
less-than-average June rainfall. Lower rainfall in the begin-
ning of the summer may influence the ratio of aerobic to
anaerobic respiration by altering soil moisture while not
affecting WTD. With the inclusion of cumulative monthly
precipitation in a stepwise multiple regression, peat temper-
ature, monthly precipitation and air temperature were the
significant predictors of mean monthly CH4 fluxes.
4.4. Modeling CH4 Fluxes
[33] We observed fluxes to be highly variable through the
year at the individual scale (Figure 2), which is reflected in
the large standard deviation of the seasonal mean measure-
ments (Figure 3). There were different relationships be-
tween CH4 flux and the suite of measured biological and

physical variables depending on the timescale (Table 4),
indicating that relationships between CH4 and simple abi-
otic and biotic factors are complex and that any modeling
approach will need to integrate numerous parameters and
processes. Additionally, variability in CH4 flux between
years was attributed to significant interannual differences in
August of each year (Figure 3) driven by accumulating
climatic effects (such as WTD and temperature interactions)
and episodic fluxes through the growing season that are
difficult to describe through simple parameters.
[34] The strength of modeling CH4 fluxes depends on the
timescale and the grouping of vegetation types. Over a
multiple year time period using all collars, air temperature
was the only consistent predictor of CH4 fluxes across all
timescales (Table 4) in Sallie’s Fen. On a monthly timescale,
mean air temperature (Figure 5a), water table (Figure 5b)
and respiration were the best predictors of CH4 flux
(Table 4). This intermediate time period produced the
strongest predictive power using a multiple regression
approach, explaining 81% of the variation in monthly
CH4 fluxes (Table 5).
5. Conclusions
[35] Five years of data at Sallie’s Fen demonstrate the
complexity of processes that contribute to the spatial and
temporal variability in CH4 fluxes. Temporal variation of
individual CH4 fluxes was high, ranging 100-fold in mag-
nitude. Aggregated CH4 fluxes on monthly and seasonal
scales showed lower variation and stronger relationships
with abiotic and biotic variables. Similarly, spatial variabil-
ity of CH4 fluxes was reduced by classifying sites by
vegetation type. Interannual differences in CH4 fluxes were
driven by elevated and variable late summer emissions,
which appeared to be caused by low water table levels and
high temperatures. Air temperature was the only variable
that was strongly correlated with CH4 fluxes at all time-
scales, while WTD had either a positive or negative corre-
lation depending on timescale and vegetation type. Using a
stepwise multiple regression, the monthly timescale pro-
duced the strongest predictive relationships among CH4
flux, air temperature and water table level (r2 = 0.81).
[36] This study shows that the strength and even the
direction of the predictive relationships are completely
dependent on the timescale and time period of measure-
ment. Given the weak correlations between CH4 flux and
environmental variables at shorter timescales than months
or seasons, research integrating both these measurements
and mechanistic modeling is needed to understand
the processes that control CH4 production, oxidation and
transport.
