ABSTRACT
CUGBP2 (ETR-3/NAPOR/BRUNOL3) promotes
inclusion of cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 via
binding between positions 21 and 74 of the down-
stream intron. The molecular mechanism by
which CUGBP2 activates cTNT exon 5 inclusion is
unknown. Our results suggest that CUGBP2 pro-
motes exon inclusion by a novel mechanism in
which CUGBP2 directly interacts with components
of the activated U2 snRNP and enhances binding of
U2 snRNP to the branch site located upstream of
the exon. Using an in vitro splicing assay, we
show that recombinant CUGBP2 enhances complex
A formation of a cTNT pre-mRNA. Enhanced com-
plex A assembly requires both the upstream and
downstream introns consistent with dual require-
ments for the downstream CUGBP2-binding site
and an upstream branch site for U2 snRNP binding.
We also show that CUGBP2 enhances binding of
U2 snRNA to the cTNT pre-mRNA consistent with
enhanced complex A assembly. Purification of
CUGBP2-interacting proteins using tandem affinity
purification leads to the demonstration that the
core 17S U2 snRNP components, SF3b145 and
SF3b49 bind directly to CUGBP2. We conclude that
CUGBP2 activates exon inclusion by forming direct
interactions with components of the 17S snRNP
complex and recruits and/or stabilizes binding of
U2 snRNP.
INTRODUCTION
Pre-mRNA splicing removes introns and joins exons
together to generate mature mRNA. Splicing requires
highly conserved 50 and 30 splice sites at the exon–intron
junctions and is catalyzed by the spliceosome which is
composed of ﬁve small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs) and >150 proteins (1). Recognition of the
splice site sequences by base-pairing of the snRNA com-
ponents of the snRNPs not only identiﬁes exons within
pre-mRNAs but also directs cleavage and rejoining (trans-
esteriﬁcation) at the correct nucleotides (2). Characteriza-
tion of spliceosome function in vitro has established that
the spliceosome assembles by a stepwise assembly of
complexes (H->E->A->B->C) representing a dynamic
addition and exchange of its components (3). First the
U1 snRNP binds to the 50 splice site in an ATP-indepen-
dent manner to form complex E followed by ATP-depen-
dent binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site sequence,
typically located 18–40 nt upstream of the exon, which
forms complex A. Incorporation of U4/U6.U5 tri-
snRNP into complex A generates complex B. Dissociation
of U1 and U4 snRNPs and U6 base-pairing with 50 splice
site creates complex C. SnRNP and other components
that bind to the splice site sequences upstream and down-
stream of the exon communicate across the exon to
‘deﬁne’ and exon for removal (4,5).
Recent estimates indicate that at least 89% of human
genes undergo alternative splicing, generating multiple
mRNAs from each gene (6,7). A large fraction of alterna-
tive splicing events are regulated to meet the functional
demands of the cell or tissue (8,9). Alternative splicing is
commonly regulated by RNA-binding proteins that bind
to sequence motifs located within the alternative exon or
within the ﬂanking intron sequences (10). Only a few stu-
dies have revealed how these RNA-binding proteins com-
municate with the basal splicing machinery to promote or
repress splicing (11–15). With a few exceptions (16), most
splicing regulators characterized to date modulate the
early stages of spliceosome assembly including formation
of complex E and A. For example, binding of Fox1/Fox2
to the consensus sequence, UGCAUG, in the upstream
intron of calcitonin exon 4 inhibits complex E0 formation
by blocking binding of SF1 to the branch site (17).

Binding of Nova to a cluster of binding sites within an
alternative exon blocks inclusion by inhibiting U1 snRNP
binding (13). Binding of TIA1 to U-rich stretches down-
stream of an exon facilitates recognition of U1 snRNP
to the 50 splice site (18). Binding of RBM25 to CGGGC
A in exon 2 of Bcl-x enhances U1 snRNP recruitment to
the weak 50 splice site (14).
CUGBP2 (ETR-3, BRUNOL3, NAPOR) is one of six
members of the CELF (CUGBP1 and ETR-3 like factor)
family. CUGBP2 contains three RNA recognition motif
(RRM) domains and directly binds to intronic sequences
to regulate splicing of chicken and human cardiac tropo-
nin T exon 5 (cTNT), insulin receptor exon 11, Tau exon
2 and 3, and NMDA R1 exons 5 and 21 (19–22). Analysis
of natural binding sites as well as results from SELEX
have demonstrated that CUGBP2 binds to UG rich
sequence motifs (21). One of the best characterized spli-
cing events regulated by CUGBP2 is the activation of
chicken cTNT exon 5. Troponin T is one of three subunits
of the troponin complex that regulates the actin–myosin
interactions that mediate muscle contraction (23). Exon 5
inclusion is regulated during heart development such that
>90% of mRNAs include the exon in embryonic heart
and >95% of mRNAs exclude the exon in the adult
(24). The embryonic exon inclusion pattern was also
favored in diﬀerentiated skeletal muscle cultures and the
cis acting elements required for enhanced inclusion in dif-
ferentiated skeletal muscle were mapped to the intron
downstream of cTNT exon 5 (19). Using transient trans-
fection of cTNT minigenes, we subsequently showed that
binding of CELF proteins (including CUGBP2) to U/G-
rich elements within these cis elements was required to
activate exon inclusion in vivo (21,25). We also demon-
strated that bacterially expressed recombinant CUGBP2
activates cTNT exon 5 in an in vitro splicing assay and
that activation required two CUGBP2-binding sites
located 21 and 74 nt downstream of the exon (19).
However, it remains unknown how CUGBP2 communi-
cates with basal splicing machinery to activate exon 5
inclusion after binding to intron 5.
In this study, we show that CUGBP2 enhances complex
A formation on an RNA containing only exon 5 ﬂanked
by segments of the upstream and downstream introns.
CUGBP2-enhanced complex A assembly requires the
upstream intron and psoralen cross-linking assays were
used to demonstrate that CUGBP2 increases binding of
U2 snRNA to the pre-mRNA. We also demonstrate that
CUGBP2 directly binds to SF3b145 and SF3b49 that
are core components of the 17S U2 snRNP complex.
These results strongly support a model in which
CUGBP2 binds downstream of exon 5 and recruits or
stabilizes binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site
upstream of the exon consistent with a mechanism of
enhanced exon deﬁnition.

Expression and purification of recombinant proteins
GST-CUGBP2 and GST-CUGBP1 were induced in BL21
by 0.2mM IPTG for 4 h at 308C. Cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 6000 g for 10min and resuspended in
extraction buﬀer [25mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol,
1mM DTT, 20mM NaCl, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.05% SDS,
1% TritonX-100 and proteinase inhibitor cocktail
buﬀer]. Cells were lysed by sonicating three times for
10 s each. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation
at 14 800 g for 10min.
His-tagged CUGBP2 was induced like a GST proteins
and puriﬁed using the Novagen kit according to the
manufacture’s protocol.
GST pull down and cross-linking
GST proteins were incubated with 30 ml of glutathione
sepharose resin in extraction buﬀer containing 150mM
NaCl and incubated on a rotating platform for 2 h at
48C then washed with the same buﬀer three times. [35S]
Methionine/Cysteine labeled SF3b145 and SF3b49 were
prepared using TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate systems
(Promega). 35S -labeled SF3b145 and SF3b49 were incu-
bated with GST, GST-CUGBP1, or GST-CUGBP2 in
binding buﬀer [20mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50mM NaCl,
0.05% NP40] with rotation at 48C. After 2 h, unbound
proteins were removed by washing with binding buﬀer
ﬁve times. Bound proteins were released with 1 SDS
PAGE loading buﬀer and loaded on 10% SDS–PAGE
gel. The gel was dried and the bands visualized using a
cyclone phosphoimager.
For protein cross-linking, DSP (ﬁnal concentration,
2mM) was added in cross-linking buﬀer (0.5M HEPES
4276 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 13
in 0.5 PBS) and incubated for 30min at 258C. Cross-
linking was stopped with 50mM Tris (pH 7.4) and incu-
bation at 258C for 10min. For RNase A treatment, RNase
A (ﬁnal concentration 50 mg/ml) was added and incubated
for 20min at 258C. The unbound proteins were washed
with cross-linking buﬀer three to four times. Cross-linking
was reversed by the thiol groups in SDS–PAGE sample
buﬀer.
Tandem affinity purification (TAP)
TAP and CUGBP-2 TAP proteins were puriﬁed according
to (28) with modiﬁcations. Stably over-expressed tet-indu-
cible TAP (CA1) and CUGBP2-TAP (DE5) HeLa cell
lines were maintained in DMEM containing 200mg/ml
hygromycin. TAP and CUGBP2-TAP were induced by
10 mg/ml (ﬁnal concentration) doxycycline. After 48 h,
cells were scraped in 1 PBS and spun down by centrifu-
gation at 6000 g for 10min. Nuclear extracts were
prepared and dialyzed against buﬀer D (26). For the
ﬁrst step aﬃnity puriﬁcation, NP40 (0.05%) and 50 mg/
ml RNase A were added to nuclear extracts and incubated
with 50 ml of IgG Sepharose (50% slurry) for 16 h at 48C.
Bound protein was washed three times with washing
buﬀer [0.1% NP40, 20mM Tris (pH 7.4), 25% glycerol,
1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM EDTA, 120mM KCl, 10mM
2-b-mercaptoethanol and 0.2mM PMSF]. The Sepharose
pellet was washed with TEV cleavage buﬀer [10mM Tris
(pH 8.0), 120mM KCl, 0.1% NP40, 0.5mM EDTA,
1mM DTT]. The tagged proteins were cleaved by
adding 25 units of TEV proteinase in 250 ml of cleavage
buﬀer and incubating at 258C with rotation for 2 h. For
the second step aﬃnity puriﬁcation, three volumes of IPP
150 buﬀer [10mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150mM NaCl, 1mM
MgOAc, 1mM imidazole, 2mM CaCl2, 10mM 2-b-mer-
captoethanol] plus 3 ml of 1M CaCl2 and 300 ml of calmo-
dulin resin (50% slurry) were added to the eluant from the
ﬁrst step and incubated on rotating platform for 3 h at
48C. Calmodulin resin was washed three times with IPP
150 buﬀer. Proteins bound to calmodulin resin were eluted
ﬁve times with 200ml of calmodulin elution buﬀer con-
taining 10mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150mM Nacl, 0.02% NP40,
1mM MgOAc, 1mM imidazole, 20mM EGTA (pH 8.0),
10mM 2-b-mercaptoethanol. Eluted proteins were preci-
pitated in 25% TCA, following 1 h on ice and centrifuga-
tion at 14 800 g for 20min at 48C. TCA precipitates
were washed with 300 ml of cold acetone and acetone
was evaporated by incubating pellet on 658C for 1min.
Pellets were dissolved in SDS–PAGE loading buﬀer and
then analyzed by SDS–PAGE.
NanoLC–MS/MS
TCA-precipitated proteins eluted from the calmodulin
resin were resolved on a 4–20% gradient gel and stained
with Coomassie Blue 250R. Bands were gel isolated and
the proteins were identiﬁed at ProtTech, Inc (Norristown,
PA) using the Nano LC–MS/MS peptide sequencing
technology.
Western blotting
The samples from TAP were resolved by SDS–PAGE and
transferred into the PVDF membrane. Anti-SF3b145,
anti-SF3b49, anti-SF3b125 and anti-CUGBP2-HRP anti-
bodies were used and pico substrate (Pierce) was used to
visualize bands.
In vitro splicing & spliceosome assembly
In vitro splicing reactions were performed with 32P-GTP
or 32P-UTP-labled RNA in splicing buﬀer (30% HeLa
nuclear extract, 1mM ATP, 20mM creatine phosphate,
2mM MgOAc, 1mM DTT, 3% PVA) at 308C for indi-
cated times. Ninety percent of each reaction was treated
with Proteinase K buﬀer [100mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5),
12.5mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1% SDS and 0.2mg/ml
proteinase K] at 378C for 30min. RNA was extracted by
phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol followed by ethanol
precipitation. RNA was dissolved in gel loading buﬀer
(Ambion, Inc). RNA was run on 8M urea 5% acrylamide
gel, dried and visualized by autoradiography. Ten percent
of each splicing reaction was run on native 0.4% agarose–
4% acrylamide gel or 1.5–2% agarose gel. The gel was
dried and bands were visualized by autoradiography.
For ATP-depleted spliceosome assembly, HeLa nuclear
extract was incubated at 308C for 30min prior to initiating
the splicing reaction and the assembly reaction was done
in the absence of ATP and creatine phosphate. The com-
plexes were resolved on a 1.5–2% native agarose gels after
adding loading buﬀer (12mg/ml heparin and 25% gly-
cerol). The gel was ﬁxed in 10% methanol and 10%
acetic acid at room temperature for 30min, dried and
visualized by autoradiography. For E complexes, heparin
was removed from loading buﬀer.
snRNAs digestion by RNase H
DNA oligonucleotides complementary to U1 snRNA
(1–12 nt) (27), U2 snRNA (26–43 nt), or non-speciﬁc olio-
nucleotide (R5S) (27), were incubated with HeLa nuclear
extract in the presence of RNase H (two unit) at 308C for
30min. The nuclear extract was used for in vitro splicing
reactions as described above.
AMT-psoralen UV cross-linking and northern blot
Splicing complexes were assembled using the unlabeled
chicken cTNT exon 5 substrate (MSE1-4, Figure 2A) at
308C in HeLa nuclear extracts in splicing conditions
described above. AMT-psoralen was added to a ﬁnal con-
centration of 20 ng/ml and the reactions were UV (365 nm)
irradiated on ice for 15min. The cross-linked RNAs con-
taining both exon 5 and U2 snRNA were detected by
northern blot analysis using DIG-labeled probes. Brieﬂy,
RNA was extracted and resolved on 8M urea 5% acryla-
mide gels, stained with ethidium bromide and transferred
to nylon membrane. Blocking was done for 30min at 428C
using Roche DIG Easy Hyb and DIG-probes were added
for a 16 h incubation at 428C. Membranes were washed
two times for 15min at 258C with northern washing buﬀer
(2 SSC, 0.5% SDS). Incubation with anti-DIG HRP
antibody was done as manufacturer’s protocol (Roche
wash & block kit). Bands were detected using Pico
substrate (Pierce).

Constructs and cell line
CUGBP2-TAP and TAP were inserted respectively into
KpnI and Not I site of pBG2i vector (29). Tet-on induci-
ble CUGBP2-TAP and TAP were stably expressed in
HeLa. Cells were maintained in DMEM media containing
hygromycin (200mg/ml). SF3b145 and SF3b49 cDNAs for
in vitro translation were provided by Dr Lu¨hrmann.
E46NB and MSE 1–4 constructs have been described
previously (19). The E45NA pre-mRNA contains (from
50 to 30) 76-nt vector, the last 14-nt cTNT exon 4, the
120-nt truncated intron 4 identical to that in E46NB
(19), 30-nt exon 5 and the ﬁrst 9 nt of intron 5. The
E56BD pre-mRNA contains (from 50 to 30) 65 nt from
the vector, the last 4 nt of intron 4, 30-nt exon 5, a
250-nt truncated intron identical to E46NB except for
6 nt missing 169 nt from exon 5, the complete 57-nt exon
6 and the ﬁrst 15 nt of intron 6.
RESULTS
CUGBP2 enhances complex A formation of the chicken
cTNT pre-mRNA
We used a three-exon cTNT pre-mRNA substrate to
determine which step of spliceosome assembly was
enhanced by CUGBP2. This substrate was previously
used to show activation of exon 5 inclusion by bacterially
expressed recombinant His-tagged CUGBP2 (19). The
cTNT substrate (E46NB, Figure 1A) was incubated in
splicing conditions during a time course and 10% of the
reaction from each time point was loaded on a native gel
to assay spliceosome assembly (Figure 1B, left). RNA
was extracted from the remaining sample and run on a
denaturing gel to follow spliced products and intermedi-
ates (Figure 1B, right). Complex A formed within 15min;
this complex was demonstrated to be ATP- and U1-
dependent (see below). Larger complexes, designated as
B and C, formed subsequently, and their appearance at
45min corresponded with appearance of spliced mRNAs
containing and lacking exon 5 and lariat intermediates
(Figure 1B, right).
We next tested the eﬀect of CUGBP2 on formation
of E46NB spliceosome complexes. CUGBP2 strongly
enhanced complex A formation in a dose-dependent
manner beginning with the earliest time point tested
(Figure 1C and D). To conﬁrm that the enhanced com-
plex was complex A and rule out CUGBP2-RNA com-
plexes unrelated to the spliceosome, we demonstrated
that this complex was not observed in the absence of
ATP (Figure 1E, right). Formation of this complex was
also blocked by RNase H-mediated digestion of the ﬁrst
12 nt of the U1 snRNA by a complementary DNA oligo-
nucleotide while a non-speciﬁc oligonucleotide (R5S)
had no eﬀect (Figure 1F). Eﬃcient U1 snRNA digestion
by RNase H was conﬁrmed with ethidium bromide
staining (Supplementary Figure 1). Only minimal assem-
bly of complex A was observed when CUGBP2 was added
to U1-digested nuclear extracts, probably reﬂecting
enhanced assembly by residual U1 snRNP. From these
results, we conclude that CUGBP2 strongly enhances com-
plex A formation during E46NB pre-mRNA splicing.
Because the E46NB substrate contains two introns, the
speciﬁc nature of the complexes formed on this RNA is
unclear. We therefore examined the eﬀect of CUGBP2 on
A-like complex assembly on an RNA substrate containing
a single exon and portions of the ﬂanking introns: cTNT
exon 5, the last 72 nt of intron 4 and the ﬁrst 149 nt of
intron 5 (MSE1-4, Figure 2A). This RNA contains the
CUGBP2-binding sites in intron 5 and was previously
shown to bind CUGBP2 (25). Isolated exons ﬂanked by
an upstream 30 splice site and downstream 50 splice site
assemble an A-like complex (30). While it is unclear
whether complex A and A-like complexes are identical,
their clear similarities are consistent with the exon deﬁni-
tion model in which exons are ‘deﬁned’ by binding of the
basal spliceosome components to the ﬂanking splice sites
prior to intron removal (4). The MSE1-4 substrate
assembled an A-like complex that was ATP-dependent
(Figure 2B and C and data not shown) and CUGBP2
enhanced A-like complex formation in dose- and time-
dependent manner (Figure 2B and C). We conclude that
CUGBP2 enhances assembly of an A-like complex on the
isolated cTNT exon 5.
Enhanced complex A assembly by CUGBP2 requires
both upstream and downstream introns
The results from Figure 2 showing that CUGBP2
enhanced assembly of an A-like complex on exon 5 alone
suggested that CUGBP2 enhances deﬁnition of exon 5. If
this was the case, the eﬀect of CUGBP2 would require both
the upstream and downstream introns. We generated two
substrates from E46NB containing either exons 4 and
5 (E45NA) or exons 5 and 6 (E56BD) (Figure 3A).
Spliceosome assembly reactions were performed over a
time course in the presence or absence of CUGBP2 for
E45NB, E45NA and E56BD substrates. All three RNA
substrates assemble complex A in the absence of
CUGBP2, as expected. CUGBP2 enhanced complex A for-
mation of E46NB as demonstrated above, but the same
CUGBP2 protein preparation did not enhance complex
A assembly of either E45NA or E56BD (Figure 3B).
E45NA lacks a CUGBP2-binding site, so the absence of
an eﬀect of CUGBP2 was expected. The results indicate
that both two-exon substrates are competent to assemble A
complexes in the absence of CUGBP2 but do not respond
to a preparation of recombinant CUGBP2 that stimulated
complex A assembly of E46NB and MSE1-4. In addition,
these results demonstrate that recombinant CUGBP2 does
not non-speciﬁcally stimulate complex A formation but
rather exhibits speciﬁcity for exons ﬂanked by its binding
site downstream and an upstream 30 splice site. Finally,
these results strongly suggest that binding of CUGBP2 to
its binding sites within intron 5 promotes communication
with basal splicing machinery across the exon 5 to enhance
complex A assembly.
CUGBP2 enhances binding of U2 snRNA to the pre-mRNA
Base-pairing of U2 snRNA to the branch site leads to for-
mation of complex A. We used psoralen UV-cross-linking

(B) Spliceosome assembly during a time course for E46NB. 32P-UTP labeled E46NB was incubated under splicing conditions for the times
indicated. Ten percent of each splicing reaction was loaded on 0.4% agarose–4% acrylamide non-denaturing gel (left). RNA was puriﬁed
from what remained and was separated on an 8M urea, 5% acrylamide gel (right). For both assays, RNA was visualized by autoradiography.
(C) CUGBP2 increases complex A formation (dose response). Puriﬁed recombinant His-CUGBP2 (145 ng and 725 ng) is shown to be >95%
pure by Coomassie staining (left). The indicated amounts of CUGBP2 were added to the splicing reactions, which were incubated for 30min
(right). (D) CUGBP2 (1 mg) increases complex A formation from the earliest time point tested. The complex enhanced by CUGBP2 is complex
A based on (E) ATP-dependence and (F) U1 dependence. In F, complex assembly reactions were performed using HeLa nuclear extracts in
which the ﬁrst 12 nt of U1 snRNA were digested using a complementary oligo and RNase H. A non-speciﬁc DNA nucleotide (R5S) was used as
a control (39).

to determine whether enhanced complex A formation by
CUGBP2 is associated with enhanced binding of U2
snRNA to the pre-mRNA. For this assay, the single
exon MSE1-4 substrate was used (Figure 2A). The unla-
beled MSE1-4 RNA was incubated with HeLa nuclear
extract using splicing conditions with and without
CUGBP2. AMT-psoralen was added followed by UV irra-
diation (see ‘Materials and methods’ section). The cross-
linked RNA products were separated electrophoretically
on urea-acrylamide gels and RNAs were identiﬁed by
northern blotting using digoxigenin (DIG)-linked probes
complementary to either exon 5 or to the U2 snRNA
(Supplementary Figure 2). RNAs found to hybridize to
both exon 5 and U2 snRNA probes were considered to
be cross-linked RNA products of U2 snRNA base-paired
with the branch site of cTNT intron 4. These RNAs are
indicated with a black arrow throughout Figure 4.
Consistent with this interpretation, the indicated RNAs
were found to require ATP (Figure 4B, lanes 7 and 8)
and to be sensitive to RNase H-mediated digestion using
DNA oligos complementary to U2 (Figure 4B, lanes 11
and 12) but not U1 snRNA (Figure 4B, lanes 9 and 10).
Importantly, the U2 cross-linked band was consistently
enhanced by addition of CUGBP2 to the splicing reaction
(Figure 4A and B). From these results, we conclude that
CUGBP2 enhances complex A formation by directly
increasing U2 snRNA base-pairing with the pre-mRNA.
CUGBP2 interacts with the U2 snRNP components,
SF3b49 and SF3b145
In a separate set of experiments, we investigated the
mechanism of CUGBP2 mediated splicing activation by
identifying CUGBP2 interacting proteins using tandem
aﬃnity puriﬁcation (TAP) (31). Tetracycline-inducible
C-terminal TAP-tagged CUGBP2 (CUGBP2-TAP) was
stably expressed in HeLa cells. CUGBP2-TAP was
demonstrated to activate cTNT exon inclusion (data not
shown). Nuclear extract was prepared from doxycycline-
induced HeLa cell lines and proteins that co-puriﬁed
with CUGBP2-TAP were isolated using modiﬁed two-
step puriﬁcation (Figure 5A and ‘Materials and Methods’
section). RNase A was included in the puriﬁcations to
exclude co-puriﬁcation of non-speciﬁc proteins via RNA
tethering. Following the ﬁnal puriﬁcation procedure,
putative CUGBP2 interacting proteins were visualized
on SDS–PAGE gels (Figure 5B). The bands that
were repeatedly observed in four independent experi-
ments were isolated and identiﬁed by LC–MS/MS.

Identiﬁed proteins included RNA-binding proteins, tran-
scription factors and translation regulators (Table 1).
Of particular interest were three components of the 17S
U2 snRNP and two U4/U6 snRNP associated splicing
factors. Because CUGBP2 enhanced complex A assembly
which requires binding of U2 to the branch site, we were
particularly interested in validating interactions between
CUGBP2 and U2 snRNP components which included two
proteins of the 17S U2 snRNP [SF3B2 (SF3b145), SF3B4
(SF3b49)] and the U2 snRNP-associated protein, DDX42
(SF3b125). To validate interactions between CUGBP2
and SF3b49, SF3b125 and SF3b145, we ﬁrst repeated
TAP puriﬁcation of CUGBP2 and associated proteins in
doxycycline-induced cultures of stable HeLa cell lines
expressing CUGBP2-TAP (DE5, Figure 6) and TAP
alone (CA1, Figure 6) as a control. Puriﬁcations were
performed with and without RNase A treatment and
eluted proteins were assayed by western blots using anti-
TAP antibodies to conﬁrm enrichment (Figure 6A). Since
the TAP tag is removed in the second puriﬁcation step,
anti-CUGBP2 antibodies were used to determine whether
the released CUGBP2 was present in the bound fraction
(Figure 6A). The same eluted proteins were also assayed
for SF3b145, SF3b125, or SF3b49 to determine whether
these proteins co-puriﬁed with released CUGBP2.
The results demonstrated that SF3b49 and SF3b145
co-puriﬁed with CUGBP2 in an RNase A-independent
manner (Figure 6A and B) suggesting either direct inter-
action or co-assembly with components of a complex.
In contrast, SF3b125 did not copurify with CUGBP2
(Figure 6C).
We next tested whether interactions between CUGBP2
and SF3b145 or SF3b49 are direct or indirect using a
GST pull down assay. Since CUGBP1 and CUGBP2
have been shown to regulate several of the same splicing
events (21,25), we tested binding of CUGBP1 as well as
CUGBP2. Bacterially expressed recombinant GST-
CUGBP1 and GST-CUGBP2 were incubated with [35S]
methionine/cysteine-labeled SF3b145 or SF3b49. Both
SF3b145 and SF3b49 were shown to bind to GST-
CUGBP1 and GST-CUGBP2 (Figure 7A and B).
However, interactions of GST-CUGBP1 and GST-
CUGBP2 with SF3b145 or SF3b49 were dramatically
reduced by RNase A treatment (Figure 7C). These results
were surprising given the result that interactions between
exogenous CUGBP2 and endogenous SF3b49 and
SF3b149 were RNA independent (Figure 7A and B).
We considered that the disparity reﬂected diﬀerences in
CELF binding sites

binding aﬃnities between CUGBP2 and the SF3b com-
ponents when the SF3b components were assembled as an
RNP in HeLa cells compared to individual proteins trans-
lated in vitro. We also considered that the presence of
RNA, even non-speciﬁc bacterial RNA co-expressed
with GST fusion proteins, could provide a scaﬀold
enhancing natural interactions between one or both
SF3b proteins and CUGBP2. To test this possibility, we
repeated the binding assays and included the reversible
protein cross-linker, DSP (dithiobis[succinimidylpropio-
nate]), prior to RNase A treatment and the GST pull
down, and then cross-linking was reversed prior to
SDS–PAGE. Interestingly, interactions of GST-
CUGBP1 with SF3b49 and SF3b149 were detected in
the presence of RNase A following treatment with the
protein cross-linker. The protein cross-linker did not pro-
mote non-speciﬁc interactions between these proteins and
GST (Figure 7D). This result indicates that both SF3b49
and SF3b149 are in contact with CUGBP2 during the
binding reaction. The RNase sensitivity of this interaction
suggests that non-speciﬁc bacterial RNA promotes these
protein–protein interactions, perhaps by maintaining a
conformation that is critical for interactions.
We conclude, based on CUGBP2-TAP co-puriﬁcation
analysis in vivo and GST pull down analysis in vitro, that
both SF3b49 and SF3b145 bind directly to CUGBP2.
Furthermore, we propose that CUGBP2 promotes inclu-
sion of cTNT exon 5 by binding downstream of the exon
and acting across the exon to promote binding of U2
snRNP to the branch site via direct interactions with
SF3b49 and SF3b145.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the mechanism by
which CUGBP2 activates chicken cTNT exon 5 inclusion.

10 and 30min at 308C were used for UV cross-linking with psoralen on ice. RNA was extracted and resolved on a 5% acrylamide/8M urea gel and
stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr, left). Northern analysis was performed to identify the U2 snRNA cross-linked to the cTNT exon 5 MSE1-4

Our results strongly support a model (Figure 8) in which
CUGBP2 recruits or stabilizes binding of the U2 snRNP
to the branch site via direct interactions with two proteins
within the activated 17S U2 complex. Furthermore,
our results suggest that CUGBP2 enhances cTNT exon
5 recognition by stimulating interactions across the
exon, consistent with enhanced exon deﬁnition. First, we
demonstrated that CUGBP2 increases complex A forma-
tion of cTNT pre-mRNAs containing exon 5. Of particu-
lar interest, CUGBP2 stimulated assembly of an A-like
complex on the MSE1-4 substrate containing exon 5 and
segments of the ﬂanking introns including the CUGBP2-
binding sites within the downstream intron. Second, stim-
ulation of complex A assembly by CUGBP2 requires the
upstream intron containing the branch site since CUGBP2
does not stimulate complex A assembly of the two-exon
substrate with just the downstream intron containing the
CUGBP2-binding site. Third, CUGBP2 was shown to
enhance binding of U2 snRNA on the single exon RNA,
MSE1-4. The requirement for the upstream intron com-
bined with the demonstration that CUGBP2 enhances
binding of the U2 snRNA strongly suggests that binding
of CUGBP2 to its binding sites located 24 and 74 nt down-
stream from exon 5 promotes binding of the U2 snRNP
by interactions across the exon. Fourth, results from
tandem aﬃnity puriﬁcation of CUGBP2-associated pro-
teins in HeLa nuclear extracts identiﬁed two proteins,
SF3b145 and SF3b49, which were shown to directly inter-
act with CUGBP2 using GST pull-down assays. Taken
together, our results strongly suggest that CUGBP2 pro-
motes or stabilizes binding of U2 snRNP to the branch
site to stimulate complex A assembly.
Spliceosome assembly is a stepwise process and each
step of assembly can be stimulated or blocked by splicing
activators or repressors. In most cases, splicing regulators
are involved in the early stages of spliceosome formation

and often modulate U1 snRNP association with the 50
splice site. For example, when TIA1 binds a U-rich
sequence downstream of an alternative exon, it increases
50 splice site recognition by recruiting U1 snRNP through
an interaction with U1-C, a U1 snRNP-associated protein
(18). Similarly, RBM25 enhances U1 snRNP binding to
the 50 splice site (14) while exonic binding of Nova inhibits
U1 snRNP recruitment to the 50 splice site (13). Splicing
regulators aﬀect early steps of spliceosome assembly by
other mechanisms. For example, PTB represses c-src
exon N1 inclusion by blocking U2AF binding to 30
splice site of the downstream exon resulting in decreased
complex E formation (15). In the case of Fas exon 5, PTB
inhibits the association of U2AF and U2 snRNP to
the upstream 30 splice site (32). HuR also inhibits U2AF
recognition of the 30 splice site without decreasing 50 splice
site recognition (33). RS domain containing proteins
engage in direct interaction with either the branch site or
50 splice site and promote U snRNA base-pairing with
pre-mRNA (34,35).
In AMT-psoralen cross-linking studies, CUGBP2 does
not inﬂuence the U1 snRNP recruitment to the 50 splice
site (data not shown). Instead, our results indicate that
CUGBP2 increases U2 snRNA binding to the pre-
mRNA to enhance assembly of complex A by interacting
with U2 snRNP proteins, SF3b49 and SF3b145, lead to
enhancement of U2 snRNP recruitment to the branch site.
In addition to being a splicing activator, CUGBP2
and its paralogue, CUGBP1 are also splicing repressors
of other substrates such as the insulin receptor exon 11
(20,36,37). This is in common with many splicing
regulators that can activate some splicing events and
repress others. Their roles as an activator or repressor
are determined by diﬀerent features, depending on the
regulator and can include post-translational modiﬁcations
and the position of the binding site relative to the alter-
native exon. For instance, phosphorylation of SRp38
induces a switch from a general splicing repressor to
a sequence-speciﬁc activator (38). Binding of Nova to
YCAY clusters in exons is associated with exon skipping
while binding to downstream intronic YCAY clusters is
associated with increased exon inclusion (13). Results sug-
gesting similar position-dependent eﬀects have been found
for Fox1/Fox2 and CUGBP2/CUGBP1 in analyses using
splicing sensitive microarrays (39–41). It is interesting that
diﬀerent positioning of a splicing regulator has such a
dramatic eﬀect on whether exon inclusion is enhanced or
repressed. It is also interesting that diﬀerent regulators
appear to promote skipping or inclusion by making con-
tact with diﬀerent spliceosome components yet binding
downstream of the exon is commonly associated with
exon inclusion while binding upstream of the exon is asso-
ciated with repression. It will be interesting to compare the
associations that CUGBP2 makes with basal splicing
machinery to repress exon inclusion.
