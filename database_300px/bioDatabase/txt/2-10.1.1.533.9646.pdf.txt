ABSTRACT
HutP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the
expression of the histidine utilization (hut) operon
in Bacillus subtilis, by binding to cis-acting regulatory
sequences on hut mRNA. It requires L-histidine and
an Mg21 ion for binding to the specific sequence
within the hut mRNA. In the present study, we show
that several divalent cations can mediate the HutP–
RNA interactions. The best divalent cations were
Mn21, Zn21 and Cd21, followed by Mg21, Co21 and
Ni21, while Cu21, Yb21 and Hg21 were ineffective. In
the HutP–RNA interactions, divalent cations cannot
be replaced by monovalent cations, suggesting that
a divalent metal ion is required for mediating the
protein–RNA interactions. To clarify their importance,
we have crystallized HutP in the presence of three
different metal ions (Mg21, Mn21 and Ba21), which
revealed the importance of the metal ion binding
site. Furthermore, these analyses clearly demon-
strated how the metal ions cause the structural
rearrangements that are required for the hut mRNA
recognition.
INTRODUCTION
Genes responsible for the degradation and utilization of
L-histidine, as a carbon and nitrogen source under nutrient-
limiting conditions, are located within the hut operon in
Bacillus subtilis. The operon consists of six open reading
frames; the hutP gene is located near the promoter, and five
other genes, hutH, hutU, hutI, hutG and hutM, are located
far downstream from the promoter. Previous biochemical
and genetic studies suggested that the hut mRNA forms a
terminator structure (+459 to +571 nt, Figure 1) in between
the hutP and hutH genes, and regulates the transcription of the
hut operon by an anti-termination mechanism (1–3). Several
bacterial proteins that regulate anti-terminator/terminator
structures have been described, including TRAP, PyrR,
LacT, BglG, SacT and GlpP (4–10). One such protein is
the hutP gene product, HutP, of B.subtilis. HutP is a 16.2
kDa protein that shares 60% sequence identity with
the HutP proteins found in other Bacillus species, such as
Bacillus halodurans (11), Bacillus cereus (12) and Bacillus
anthracis (13).
HutP is a positive regulatory protein that interacts specif-
ically with the terminator region (3) of hut mRNA. Similar to
the other transcriptional regulatory proteins mentioned above,
it requires a ligand for its activation; HutP requires L-histidine
as a ligand for binding to the terminator RNA (3). For com-
plete activation of HutP, a concentration of 10 mM L-
histidine was sufficient for binding to the cognate RNA
(14). Using various analogs of L-histidine, we determined
that the imidazole ring and the backbone of L-histidine
are important for supporting RNA binding in vitro (14,15).

Obviously, it is intriguing how the ligand (L-histidine) modu-
lates HutP for binding to the terminator. In order to obtain
insights into these interactions, we recently solved the
crystal structure of the HutP–HBN (L-histidine analog,
L-histidine b-naphthylamide) complex (14). The complex
structure revealed that HutP forms a hexamer, which consists
of three dimers of HutP. The L-histidine was located in
between the two monomers of HutP and participates in an
extensive hydrogen bond network within the hydrophobic
pocket (14). Furthermore, we mapped the HutP binding
sites within the terminator region, as the UAGNNNNUAG-
NNNNUAG recognition motif, where N indicates any base,
and also identified the important chemical groups of the bases
within the core region (UAG) (16).
To analyze the ability of HutP to bind to mRNA, the reac-
tions are carried out in the presence of L-histidine (10 mM)
and Mg2+ ions (5 mM). However, we do not know what func-
tion the metal ions play in anti-termination complex forma-
tion. In order to understand the role of metal ions in the
formation of this complex, we used a gel mobility shift
assay, and these studies suggested that Mg2+ ions are important
for the HutP–RNA interactions (17). Furthermore, our qua-
ternary complex analyses revealed that the Mg2+ ions were
simultaneously coordinated within the histidine cluster of
HutP and the L-histidine ligand. Upon these interactions,
the Mg2+ ion was found to facilitate appropriate structural
rearrangements, especially at the L-histidine binding site
and the loop regions of HutP, thus leading to the recognition
of the cognate RNA sequence (17). All of the structural
rearrangements caused by the divalent metal ions are essential
for the RNA recognition. The L-histidine movement only
occurred in the presence of the metal ion. The side chain of
Arg88 moved in the opposite direction of the L-histidine and
formed a salt bridge, leading to the disruption of the hydro-
phobic pocket formed by the salt bridge between Arg88 and
Glu81 in the HutP–HBN complex, and formed a new salt
bridge with Arg98. In order to establish this new salt bridge
interaction with the L-histidine ligand, the conformation of the
residue Arg98 changes drastically, and this is accompanied by
a large shift in the Ca position of the next residue, Thr99.
Owing to these structural rearrangements caused by the dival-
ent metal ion, the Thr99 side chain forms two hydrogen bonds
with the N3 and 20-OH of the A base in the UAG motif. The
involvement of the metal ions in the histidine cluster causes
the His138 residue to reorient its imidazole ring to coordinate
with the divalent metal ion. This critical contribution for the
metal ion coordination causes a large conformational change
in the local backbone chain, particularly in the loop regions L3
and L5 (17). Therefore, we suggest that the divalent metal ions
play a major role in activating the HutP protein through the
structural rearrangements specifically required for the RNA
recognition. Divalent and monovalent cations play several
important roles in mediating the catalysis and folding of
bio-molecules (18–21). However, in RNA–protein interac-
tions, the affinity of a protein for its RNA ligand generally
decreases with increasing ionic strength, reflecting the con-
tribution of ionic contacts to the RNA–protein interaction.
The effects of several cations on RNA–protein complexes,
including the R17 coat protein and its translational operator
complex (22), the Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S4–16S
ribosomal RNA complex (23), the signal recognition particle
(SRP)–Ffh complex (24), the C5 protein–M1 RNA complex
(25) and the E.coli L11–23S rRNA ribosomal protein complex
(26), have been evaluated. Interestingly, these RNA–protein
complexes involve longer RNAs (S4–16S, SPR–Ffh, C5
protein–M1 RNA and L11–23S rRNA complexes) within
the complex, and they specifically require divalent metal
ions for the interactions. The metal ions in these complexes
are primarily needed for folding/stabilizing alternative RNA
conformations for recognition by the cognate protein, rather
than directly mediating the interactions. On the other hand,
RNA-binding proteins that bind to single-stranded RNA, such
as Sex-lethal (27), Poly(A) binding protein (28), transcription
termination factor Rho (29) and TRAP (30), recognize and
bind their RNAs even in the absence of metal ions. Thus, based
on these examples, it appears that the divalent metal ions are
primarily required in the RNA–protein complexes when
longer RNAs (>55 nt) are involved, to obtain a specific sec-
ondary structure for complex formation [e.g. the L11–RNA
complex (31)]. Alternatively, it is possible in some cases that
the metal ions may be required to mediate specific interactions
between the RNA and the protein, without interacting with
the RNA.
In the present study, we show that a single-stranded RNA-
binding protein, HutP, is an L-histidine and divalent metal
ion-dependent anti-termination protein that binds to the
RNA sequences within the terminator region of hut mRNA.
Among the 15 divalent metal ions tested, only Cu2+, Yb2+ and
Hg2+ failed to support the HutP–RNA interactions, while Mn2+,
Zn2+ and Cd2+ were the best metal ions. Monovalent
metal ions, such as, Na+ and K+, could not substitute for
the divalent metal ions in the HutP–RNA interaction. These
analyses suggest that a metal ion binding pocket exists within
the HutP protein that specifically coordinates with its
counterparts. To determine whether specific divalent metal
ion interactions occur with HutP, we solved the crystal
structures of HutP in the presence of three metal ions,
Mn2+, Ba2+ and Mg2+. Interestingly, all three divalent ions
reside in a precise position and interact specifically with the
HutP residues His73, His77 and His138, and the L-histidine
ligand. A comparison of the complex structures of HutP in
the presence and absence of divalent metal ions suggests that
the metal ions cause structural rearrangements, especially at
the loop regions, by interacting with the histidine cluster and
L-histidine ligand. These structural rearrangements of the
HutP protein might be required for recognizing the specific
sequences in the terminator region of the hut mRNA. Thus,
the divalent metal ion plays a major role in the regulation of
HutP–RNA interactions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression and purification of the HutP protein
The nucleotide sequence encoding HutP, containing the Val 51
Ile mutation, was amplified and cloned into the pET5a vector
(Promega). The resultant plasmid was transformed into
E.coli strain BL21 (DE3). The HutP protein was overex-
pressed at mid-log phase by the addition of isopropyl-b-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM) and was purified as described
previously (32).

RNA synthesis and 50 end labeling
A minimal RNA element, 50-CAUAGAUCUUAGAC-
GAUAGGG-30, which binds to HutP, was chemically synthes-
ized on an RNA/DNA synthesizer (Model 394; Applied
Biosystems Inc.) using phosphoramidite chemistry. All amid-
ites were purchased from Glen Corporation, USA. The chem-
ical groups of the RNA were deprotected by established
protocols (ABI Manual), and the resulting RNA was purified
on a 20% acrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The RNA was
located, eluted from the gel pieces and recovered by
ethanol precipitation, as described previously (14). The
RNAs were labeled at the 50 end with [g-32P]ATP (Amersham
Biosciences) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase
(Takara, Japan), and the labeled products were recovered
after fractionation by 15% denaturing PAGE.
Gel-shift assay
To evaluate the role of metal ions in the protein–RNA inter-
actions, we carried out a gel-shift assay. The 21mer RNA was
labeled as described above. The calculated concentrations of
HutP were based on the hexamer (96 000 Da). The purified
HutP was extensively dialyzed in binding buffer (15 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mM NaCl and 10 mg of yeast tRNA) to
remove the MgCl2. The HutP protein (1200 nM concentration)
was mixed with the RNA (21mer) probe with different con-
centrations of metal ions, in the presence of 10 mM L-
histidine. The resulting reaction mixture was incubated for
15 min at room temperature, and then was mixed with 2 ml
of 90% glycerol before loading onto the gel. The free RNA and
HutP–RNA complexes were resolved using a 10% polyacryl-
amide gel (running buffer, 0.5· TBE; constant voltage, 15 mA;
temperature, 4C). The resulting autoradiograms were ana-
lyzed with a bio-image analyzer, BAS 2500 (Fuji Film).
The equilibrium dissociation (Kd) constants were determined
for the metal ions mediating protein–RNA complex formation,
which were fit to the following equation: Y ¼ Bmax X/Kd + X
Y ¼ Specific binding‚Bmax ¼ maximum binding‚
X ¼ concentration of ligand:
A nonlinear regression analysis was carried out using the
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software).
Crystallization and data collection
The HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+, HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ and
HutP–Mg2+ (crystallized in the absence of L-histidine) complex
crystals were grown at 20C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion
method. Drops consisted of 2 ml protein, 1 ml 0.1 M L-histidine,
1ml RNA and 2ml well solution (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 M
MgCl2 or MnCl2 or BaCl2, 40% MPD). In order to crystallize
the HutP in the presence of only Mg2+, we omitted the
L-histidine from the above experiments. Diffraction data
were collected using a CCD (ADSC) detector at the Photon
Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. Datasets for the HutP–L-histidine–
Mn2+ and HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ and HutP–Mg2+ crys-
tals structures were processed up to 2.20, 2.35 and 2.60 A˚,
respectively, with the HKL2000 suite of programs (33). The
HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+, HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ crystals
belonged to the P21212, space group, and the HutP–Mg
2+
crystals belonged to the P213 space group (Table 2).
Structure determination
The HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+, HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ and
HutP–Mg2+ (crystallized in the absence of L-histidine) struc-
tures were determined by molecular replacement, using the
HutP–HBN complex as a search model (PDB ID 1VEA). Both
molecular replacement and model refinement were carried out
using CNS (34). The protein model was built using the pro-
gram Quanta (35). The structures of the HutP–L-histidine–
Mn2+, HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ and HutP–Mg2+ complexes
were refined to 2.30, 2.35 and 2.70 A˚, respectively, and the
overall refinements and model statistics are given in Table 2.
The HutP–Mg2+ crystals contain two molecules in the asym-
metric unit, whereas the HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+ and HutP–L-
histidine–Ba2+ crystals contain three molecules. The final
HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+ complex model contains three mono-
mers (A, B and C) of HutP (except for residue 22 of molecule
A, residue 22 of molecule B and residues 21–24 of molecule
C), three Mn2+ ions, three L-histidines, 6 PEGs and 367 water
molecules in the asymmetric unit. Residues 2–4 of molecules
A and B in the final model of HutP–Mg2+ and the N-terminal
residues of all of the molecules in these analyses were not
modeled, because of the absence of electron density. Also,

Ribbons (36) and XtalView (37) programs.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our previous analyses suggested that the HutP protein binds to
its cognate RNA only upon activation by L-histidine (14).
Recently, we showed that the HutP protein also requires
Mg2+ ions for RNA recognition (17). Taken together, HutP
requires divalent cations and L-histidine to recognize its cog-
nate RNA sequences in the hut mRNA. To assess the import-
ance of metal ions in the HutP–RNA interactions, in the
present study, we analyzed their interactions in the presence
of various divalent and monovalent metal ions and their ability
to cause the structural rearrangements required for the HutP–
RNA interactions.
Requirement of Mg2+ ions for HutP–RNA interactions
Although Mg2+ ions are essential for the HutP–RNA interac-
tions, to recognize the specific sequence within the terminator
region, their affinity for the ternary complex is unknown.
Therefore, we carried out binding reactions with various
Mg2+ concentrations (0–3.5 mM) in the presence of the
HutP–L-histidine–RNA. The resulting complexes were separ-
ated, and the amount of complex formed was quantitated and

fitted into a saturation binding equation, using Graphpad
Prism. Two independent analyses suggested that MgCl2 has
a 489 ± 51 mM Kd for binding the HutP–RNA complex
(Figure 2). The Kd value for the HutP–RNA interactions
appeared to be more efficient (>10-fold) as compared with
those of the metal ions involved in other protein–RNA inter-
actions, suggesting the existence of an efficient metal ion
binding pocket. Therefore, HutP represents the first example
of a single-stranded RNA-binding protein that requires metal
ions for mediating the RNA–protein interactions.
Although the importance of Mg2+ in the stabilization of
RNA conformations is known, most of the RNA–protein inter-
actions studied thus far are only influenced weakly by Mg2+.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase binding to tRNA and ribosomal
protein S8 binding to rRNA are enhanced only several-fold by
Mg2+ (38–41). The R17 coat protein recognition of hairpin
RNA is unaffected by Mg2+ (22). However, the formation of
the L11–RNA protein complex strongly required Mg2+ (23). In
this complex, Mg2+ binds to RNA with higher affinity (Kd 
3 mM). Recently, the importance of metal ions in this complex
was revealed by X-ray analyses, which showed that the dival-
ent cation occupies a crucial location at the center of a four-
way junction, where the ion appears to stabilize the sharp turns
(1056–1057 and 1086–1087) of the junction. Thus, the metal
ion seems to play a crucial role in determining the overall
structure of the four-way junction (31). Interestingly, in the
case of HutP, the divalent metal ions interact with the histidine
cluster and the L-histidine ligand, but not with the RNA, in
contrast to other protein–RNA complexes.
Analysis of HutP–RNA interactions in the presence of
various divalent cations
From the aforementioned studies, it is clear that divalent metal
ions, Mg2+ ions, are essential for mediating the HutP–RNA
interactions. To substantiate the requirement for divalent metal
ions and also to identify the best divalent metal ions that
support the interactions, we performed binding reactions in
the presence of various divalent metal ions. The properties of
the divalent metal ions used in the present study including their
ionic radii, preferred coordination and concentrations present
within the bacterial cells, are summarized in Table 1. Of the
15 different divalent metal ions tested, 12 were able to mediate
the HutP–RNA interactions. The only metal ions that failed to
support the interactions were Cu2+, Yb2+ and Hg2+ (Figure 3).
Among the 12 divalent ions that participated in the interac-
tions, Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ were more efficient, followed by
Mg2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ ions (Figure 3). Interestingly, the divalent
metal ions that are less abundant in the bacterial cell, such as
Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+, were the active divalent metal ions,
whereas the more commonly found divalent metal ions,
Mg2+, Ag2+ and Ca2+, were weakly efficient.
Interestingly, Ni2+ ions, which are reportedly not present
within bacterial cells, also mediate the complex formation
better than Mg2+, and other metals that are not found in bac-
teria, such as Ba2+, Pb2+, Pt2+ and Sr2+, also participated in the
complex. We compared the atomic radii of the metal ions that
support the HutP–RNA interactions, in order to understand the
pocket that accommodates the metal ions. When we compared
the ionic radii of the metal ions, based on their preferred
hexameric coordination, we found that the radii for Cu2+ (0.73),
Mg2+ (0.72) and Co2+ (0.74) were nearly the same size. How-
ever, Cu2+ failed to interact with the complex. In a similar way,
although the radii between the Yb2+ and Zn2+ ions were essen-
tially the same size, Yb2+ was non-interactive, whereas Zn2+
showed the highest interactions with the protein–RNA, com-
plex. The Ba2+ ion, which has the longest ionic radius, showed
the lowest support for the HutP–RNA interactions. This could
be due to the increase of coordination distances between Ba2+
and N atoms of the histidine residues (0.3 A˚ larger) than
those between Mg2+ (and also Mn2+) and N atoms of the
histidine residues, which leads widening of the dimer inter-
face. Although these studies suggested that the atomic radii of
the divalent metal ions are important for their support in medi-
ating the HutP–RNA interactions, it is possible that the medi-
ating mechanism might be much more complicated.
We next analyzed whether the monovalent cations could
substitute for divalent cations in the HutP–RNA interactions.

For this, binding reactions were carried out in the binding
buffer in the presence of 10 and 100 mM of NaCl or KCl
and analyzed for the ternary complex formation. Both of the
monovalent cations failed to mediate the interactions at the
above concentrations and in the absence of divalent cations.
These results suggested that divalent cations are required for
the interactions.
Crystal structures of HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+,
HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ and HutP–Mg2+
The previous analyses revealed that divalent metal ions are
important for the HutP–RNA interactions. In order to evaluate
the metal ion coordinations within the HutP and L-histidine
ligand complex, we chose two other metal ions (Ba2+ and
Mn2+), in addition to Mg2+, which showed lower and higher
levels of binding influence on HutP, representatively. All of
the crystallization trials were carried out with HutP, L-
histidine, and BaCl2, MnCl2 or MgCl2 ions. Well-ordered
crystals were appeared within a week and reached to a size
of 0.2 · 0.1 · 0.2 mm. Two of the crystals (HutP–L-
histidine–Mn2+ and HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+) belong to the
space group P21212 and contain three complexes per asym-
metric unit, whereas the HutP–Mg2+ (crystallized in the

group, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. All of the
structures, HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+, HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+
and HutP–Mg2+, were solved by molecular replacement
with HutP–HBN (PDB 1VEA) as a search model and were
refined to 2.30, 2.35 and 2.70 A˚ resolutions with R factors of
25.4% (Rfree ¼ 30.5%), 24.7% (Rfree ¼ 30%) and 22.8
(Rfree ¼ 28.6%), respectively. The refinement statistics are
given in Table 2, together with further details of the X-ray
analysis.
The overall structures of the HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+ and
HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ complexes are superimposed in
Figure 4a. Each asymmetric unit contains three molecules
of HutP and three L-histidines related by non-
crystallographic 3-fold axis, forming a tight trimer, with
each monomeric HutP molecule consisting of four a-helices
and four b-strands, arranged in the order a–a–b–a–a–b–b–b
in the primary structure, and the four antiparallel b-strands
form a b-sheet in the order b1–b2–b3–b4, with two a-helices
each on the front and the back (Figure 4a). Consistent with
previous X-ray and biochemical analyses, these complexes
form a hexameric structure along the 2-fold axis
(Figure 4b). The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of
superposition between these two complexes was 0.32 A˚. How-
ever, these complex structures correlated well with our
recently solved structures of the HutP–L-histidine–Mg2+ com-
plex (RMSD, 0.25 A˚) and the HutP–L-histidine–Mg2+–21mer
complex (RMSD, 0.35 A˚) (17). The overall structure of the
HutP–Mg2+ complex (crystallized in the absence of
L-histidine) was superimposed on our recently reported struc-
tures, HutP–HBN (RMSD, 0.18 A˚) and uncomplexed HutP

(RMSD, 0.31 A˚), as shown in Figure 4c, and from this figure it
is clear that the HutP–Mg2+ structure correlates well with those
two structures (14,17).
The 2|Fobs|  |Fcalc| maps of HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+ and
HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ showed clear electron densities
corresponding to divalent metals in their binding sites
(Figure 5a and b). These sites were further confirmed using
anomalous difference Fourier maps (Supplementary Figures 1
and 2). These specific binding sites, identified, were consistent
in the present HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+ and HutP–L-histidine–
Ba2+, and our recently reported HutP–L-histidine–Mg2+, and
HutP–L-histidine–Mg2+–21mer RNA complexes. The bound
metal ions (Mn2+, Ba2+ and Mg2+) were located at the dimer or
dimer–dimer interface with a similar recognition motif, crit-
ically forming the hexa-coordination with the L-histidine lig-
and and the histidine cluster of the HutP protein (Figure 5a). Of
the six coordinations, two were with the amino and carboxyl
groups of the L-histidine ligand, and the three others were with
the imidazole nitrogens of His138, His73 and His77. The sixth
coordination of the Mg2+ ion was that with a water molecule,
which was anchored by a hydrogen bond to the side chain of
Glu81. This typical hexa-coordination with the L-histidine and
histidine cluster may not be possible with the monovalent
metal ions (K+ and Na+), and hence these metal ions could
not mediate the protein–RNA interactions (Figure 3). In
the case of the HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ complex, we found
three additional non-specific Ba2+ ions located at the center
of the HutP trimer (Figure 4a and b). However, these three
Ba2+ are related by non-crystallographic 3-fold axis and may
be occurred as alternative positions of a disordered Ba2+ ion. A
view of these Ba2+ positions and their interactions (Figure 5b)
shows that each Ba2+ bonded with two coordinations derived
from the two molecules, i.e. the O atom of Gly89 of one
molecule and the other from the OE2 of Glu90 from the
adjacent molecule. However, this Ba2+-binding site is not
required for the RNA binding or structural rearrangements,
because without this metal ion interactions, Mn2+ and Mg2+
can mediate the interactions as well.
In order to substantiate the importance of the histidine
cluster in the specific divalent metal ion coordination site,
we mutated all three histidines (His73, His77 and His138)
individually and analyzed the RNA binding. These binding
analyses showed that all of the histidines involved in the
metal ion interactions were required for the coordination as
observed recently with Mg2+ ions (17). Since all three of the
divalent metal ions (Mn2+, Ba2+ and Mg2+) were able to bind
to HutP, are there any differences in the metal ion coordina-
tions with their counterparts? Why did the Ba2+ ion weakly
facilitate the activation? The metal ion coordinations were
essentially the same in all of the cases, whereas the coordina-
tion distance changed slightly, depending on the metal ion
radius. We averaged each coordination distance individually
in all three of the observed sites, and these values are depicted
in Figure 6. Although the bonding distances varied slightly
among the metal ions, the average coordination distances
for Mn2+, Ba2+ and Mg2+ were 2.26, 2.60 and 2.28 A˚, respect-
ively. The maximum difference in coordination distances
observed for Ba2+ was 0.33 A˚, in comparison with Mg2+,
and this may be due to the difference in ionic radii
(Table 1). Owing to the larger ionic radius of the Ba2+
ions, all six of the metal coordinating functional groups
moved away (0.3–0.4 A˚) from the center of the ion,
as compared with the Mn2+ and Mg2+ ions. The Kd of
Ba2+ is probably much higher than those of the Mn2+ and
Mg2+ ions; however, we have not determined the Kd, yet.
Even though the ionic radius of Mn2+ is slightly higher than
that of Mg2+, the coordination distances were almost equal
(0.02 A˚). Since the metal ion resides in between the HutP
monomers the interface may accept a wide range of divalent
metal ions with different ionic radii (0.72–1.35 A˚).
Role of divalent metal ions in the HutP–RNA
interactions
Interestingly, when we analyzed the recently reported struc-
tures of HutP (uncomplexed HutP, HutP–HBN complex,
HutP–L-histidine–Mg2+ and HutP–L-histidine–Mg2+–21mer
complex) and the current complex structures of HutP
(HutP–L-histidine–Mn2+, HutP–L-histidine–Ba2+ and HutP–
Mg2+), obviously, it was quite clear that the specific metal
ion coordination with the histidine cluster of HutP and the L-
histidine ligand are essential for the rearrangements. The
uncomplexed HutP, HutP–Mg2+ (crystallized in the absence
of L-histidine) and HutP–HBN complexes assumed similar
conformations (inactive/preactive), suggesting that the Mg2+
ion or L-histidine ligand alone may not be sufficient for the
activation of HutP. This is consistent with our biochemical
analyses (17). In the absence of L-histidine, two interactions

with the metal ions are lost in the HutP–Mg2+ complex, and
that is why the metal ion itself may not reside in the complex to
facilitate the required structural rearrangements. When we
introduced the divalent metal ion into the HutP–L-histidine
complex, the metal ion bound to the L-histidine moved away
from the original location (12 A˚) and changed the HutP con-
formation, by settling within the specific binding site and
interacting with the histidine cluster and the L-histidine ligand.
In order to extend the metal ion coordination, with the HutP,
the HutP protein undergoes a significant conformational
change, especially in the loop regions, L3, L4 and L5, in
addition to the L-histidine binding site (Figure 4d). This con-
formational change becomes evident upon a comparison of the
inactive/preactive conformations and the divalent metal ion
complexes. The divalent metal ion complexes represent the
activated conformation of HutP, which is ready to recognize
the hut mRNA. Also, it is clear that there are no further con-
formational changes of the activated HutP protein upon RNA
binding (17).
In summary, the present results suggest that many divalent
metal ions can mediate the HutP–RNA interactions, but mono-
valent cations cannot. These new crystal structures also
revealed the existence of a specific divalent metal ion binding
site that can accommodate different divalent cations with ionic
radii ranging from 0.72 to 1.35 A˚. Furthermore, as previously
observed with Mg2+ ions, other metal ions, such as Mn2+ and
Ba2+, ions together with L-histidine (ligand) can modulate the
HutP structure at the loop regions to facilitate binding to the
hut mRNA.
