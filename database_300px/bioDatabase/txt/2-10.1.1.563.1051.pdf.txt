Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Signaling to
Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase
More than a FLeeTing Moment
Michelle I. Lin, William C. Sessa
There is substantial evidence supporting the idea thatthe process of angiogenesis requires the synthesis ofendothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). NO, charac-
terized as a major endothelial-derived relaxing factor, exerts
paracrine and autocrine roles in maintaining cardiovascular
homeostasis, vascular tone, and microvascular permeability.
During the early steps of angiogenesis in which new blood
vessels sprout from existing vascular beds, there is a persis-
tence of vasodilation and increase in vascular permeability,
suggesting that these hemodynamic changes in the existing
vasculature are indispensable during an angiogenic process.
A number of angiogenic factors can triggers the release of
NO, synthesized by the endothelial isoform of NO synthase
(eNOS). One such factor is the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), which as its name implies, is a critical
mitogenic, chemoattractant, and survival factor for endothe-
lial cells1 in addition to being characterized as a potent
vascular permeability factor.2 Early studies have demon-
strated that VEGF can readily stimulate NO production in
cultured cells and isolated blood vessels and that NO is
essential in mediating the VEGF-induced endothelial cell
proliferation and organization into tubes in 3D cultures.3,4
Subsequent in vivo studies have also demonstrated that eNOS
knockout mice had significantly attenuated VEGF and ische-
mia induced angiogenesis and vascular permeability.5,6 These
studies place eNOS derived NO as a key mediator of VEGF
induced angiogenesis in postnatal mice.
Since the discovery of VEGF, or VEGF-A, and subsequent
members of the VEGF family (VEGF-B, -C, -D, -E, and
placenta growth factor, PlGF), intense research has been
performed to elucidate their modes of action. These growth
factor ligands bind to 3 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
namely VEGF receptor-1, -2, and -3 as well as to coreceptors
such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans or neuropilins. Like
many other RTKs, these receptors are able to form ho-
modimers or heterodimers depending on the binding proper-
ties of the ligand. On dimerization of the receptors, activation
of the tyrosine kinase follows leading to autophosphorylation
of the receptor, thus creating docking sites for subsequent
binding and activation of downstream signaling molecules.
Much attention has focused on the signaling events elicited
by VEGF-A (herein after referred to as VEGF), which can
bind to the receptors, VEGFR-1 (also called Flt-1) and
VEGFR-2 (also called Flk-1 in mouse or KDR in human).
Gene ablation of either of these 2 receptors revealed impor-
tant and distinct functional differences during vascular devel-
opment: whereas the Flk-1 null mice die between embryonic
days 8.5 to 9.5 as a result of decreased vasculogenesis
because of early defect in hematopoietic and endothelial cells
in blood islands,7 the Flt-1 null mice die between embryonic
days 8.5 to 9, attributable to an obstruction of vessels by an
overgrowth of endothelial cells.8 These studies suggest that
whereas Flk-1 functions as a positive regulator for endothelial
cell proliferation and differentiation, Flt-1 functions as the
negative regulator. Interestingly, a subsequent study examin-
ing mice which were lacking the Flt-1 tyrosine-kinase domain
revealed normal vascular development, which raised an
interesting hypothesis that Flt-1 functions to sequester VEGF
from Flk-1 during embryogenesis.9 This is supported by the
evidence that Flt-1 binds to VEGF with much higher affinity
than Flk-1 although exhibiting 10-fold less kinase activity,
thus suggesting that Flt-1 may serve to “trap” VEGF, limiting
Flk-1 signaling. Despite the fact that the tyrosine kinase
domain of Flt-1 is dispensable during embryonic vasculogen-
esis/angiogenesis, other cells from these mice are impaired
and experiments using chimeras of Flt-1 and the juxtamem-
brane region of Flk-1 (and vice versa) have revealed an
uncoupling of signaling pathways between migratory and
proliferative responses to the same VEGF stimulus.10
Because of the complexity of VEGF signaling, it remains
difficult to delineate the signaling mechanism that lies down-
stream of either Flt-1 or Flk-1 as both receptors can signal
through common ligands. Furthermore, there is increasing
evidence that suggest these 2 receptors may interact and
possibly regulate each other (reviewed by Matsumoto and
Claesson-Welsh11). Many studies have used overexpression
of either receptor in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs),
which do not normally express these receptors12; antibodies
directed against either receptor to abolish individual down-
stream signaling pathways13; or overexpression of a chimeric
receptor fusing the intracellular and juxtamembrane domains
of Flk-1 or Flt-1 to different extracellular domain such as
colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor,14 or epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR).15 The latter system allows
independent activation of either receptor (EGFR–Flt-1, called

EGLT, or EGFR–Flk-1, called EGDR) using EGF as an
agonist to stimulate the kinase activity of Flt or Flk without
activating the endogenous VEGF receptors. This may be
advantageous in bypassing issues in which endogenous re-
ceptors can heterodimerize and complicate the signaling
pathways downstream from each receptor.
In this present study in Circulation Research, Ahmed et al
described that the activation of eNOS via VEGF signaling
can occur via both Flt-1 and Flk-1. They demonstrated that
eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177 via a phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) mechanism can occur through EGF activa-
tion of the chimeric EGLT receptor and this promotes in vitro
angiogenesis. Several key tyrosine residues have been iden-
tified on both Flt-1 and Flk-1 whereby on receptor dimeriza-
tion, autophosphorylation of these residues can lead to
binding and activation of downstream signaling molecules.
Of particular interest, the tyrosine residues at 794 and 1169
have been identified as major binding sites for phospholipase
C gamma (PLC) whereby the amino acids spanning these
residues contain consensus sequence for the binding of the
N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in PLC.16,17
However, very little is known about the downstream signal-
ing events from these residues as well as other tyrosine
residues identified to date.
Ahmed et al demonstrated that the activation of eNOS via
EGLT is dependent on the phosphorylation on the Tyr794
residue on Flt-1, as the truncated mutant, EGLT-793S,
abolished the EGF stimulated eNOS phosphorylation on
Ser1177. Furthermore, introduction of a nonphosphorylatable
mutant Tyr794Phe into HUVECs significantly diminished
NO release on EGF stimulation.15 An earlier report published
by the same group demonstrated that VEGF mediated in vitro
endothelial cell tube formation was dependent on Flt-1
signaling and that this was NO dependent as exogenous NO
donor partially reversed the decrease in tube formation when
an antibody against Flt-1 was added to neutralize the effect of
VEGF.13 Using the same EGLT and EGDR chimeric receptor
system, it was previously demonstrated that Tyr794 was
critical in the inhibitory actions by which Flt-1 can exert on
Flk-1 in stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and that this
was because of the passive trapping of ligand by Flt-1.18 This
inhibitory action of Flt-1 was also dependent on the p85
regulatory subunit of PI3K.18 Interestingly, the negative
effect of Flt-1 on Flk-1 does not alter endothelial cell
migration, suggesting the existence of a divergent regulatory
mechanism by these receptors on different endothelial func-
tions.18 These studies contrast a previous report in which the
juxtamembrane domain (in which Tyr794 is located) of Flt-1
was swapped with that from Flk-1 and this domain negatively
regulated Flk-1 downstream signaling events, such as p85
phosphorylation and endothelial cell migration, but not phos-
phorylation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK).19
Despite the importance of the Tyr794 residue in mediating
several endothelial functions, it remains to be elucidated
whether or not the negative regulation of Flt-1 on Flk-1 also
applies to the subsequent activation of eNOS.
Ahmed et al report regulation of eNOS activation by via
Tyr951 phosphorylation on Flk-1. Flk-1 was long been
thought to be the major mediator of physiological and
pathological effects of VEGF (reviewed by Cross et al20).
Several tyrosine residues on Flk-1 have been mapped and
examined in the context of signal transduction. In particular,
Tyr1054 and Tyr1059 have been found to be required for
maximal activation of the Flk-1 tyrosine kinase.21 Further-
more, Tyr951 has been shown to be important in VEGF
mediated migration but not proliferation.22 Indeed, the phos-
phorylation of Tyr951 can also mediate the binding of the
VEGF receptor associated protein (VRAP), which can serve
as an adaptor protein for the binding of PLC and PI3K,23 or
mediate the direct binding to the N-terminal or C-terminal
SH2 domain in PLC.24 Thus, it is interesting that Ahmed et
al observed that this residue is also important in the activation
of eNOS through a PLC dependent pathway. PLC activa-
tion downstream of Flk-1 has been thought to be mainly
attributable to Tyr1175 autophosphorylation,25 leading to
subsequent activation of MAP kinase, resulting in increased
endothelial cell proliferation.26 Moreover, mice which ex-
press the nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine mutant of this
residue (Tyr1173Phe in mice) die in utero at embryonic day
8.5 to 9.5, similar to Flk-1 null mice, suggesting that
phosphorylation of Tyr1175 and subsequent signaling down-
stream from this residue are critical during vascular develop-
ment.27 This residue has also been thought to be essential for
the activation of PI3K and protein kinase B (Akt) activities
supported by the evidence that Tyr1175Phe mutant had
decreased association of the Flk-1 receptor to the p85
regulatory subunit of PI3K.28 Thus, Tyr1175 is also likely to
be involved in Flk-1 activation of eNOS through a PI3K/Akt
pathway as, Ahmed et al demonstrated, and both receptors
converge on the activation of Akt leading to eNOS phosphor-
ylation. Introduction of a dominant negative form of Akt
completely abolished EGF induced NO release and in vitro
tube formation in HUVEC expressing either EGLT or EGDR.
As a final thought, it remains enigmatic what the relative
contributions of Flt-1 versus Flk-1 signaling are to VEGF
biology, as VEGF binds with very high affinity to Flt-1 (Kd 1
to 20 pM) compared with that of Flk-1 (Kd 50 to 770 pM); yet,
Flt-1 receptor phosphorylation in response to VEGF is quite low,
and can only be readily observed in overexpression models.
Although studies in which the VEGF receptors or chimeric
receptors are overexpressed can offer insights into dissecting the
signaling mechanisms through individual receptors without con-
founding factors, it remains difficult to validate how these
models mimic the physiological situation. For instance, it has
been estimated that the expression of Flt-1 is 3,000 copies per
cell whereas Flk-1 is expressed at 40,000 copies per cell. The
overexpression of these chimeric receptors may not resemble the
natural frequency or distribution of endogenous Flt-1 versus
Flk-1. Despite this caveat, the study by Ahmed et al showing that
eNOS activation by VEGF can occur through Flt-1 adds another
level of complexity to the VEGF receptor signaling story.
Precisely how these 2 receptors respond to the same ligand to
trigger different signaling events, including cross talk or feed-
back and eventually converge on the activation of eNOS through
Akt still needs to be thoroughly investigated.

Figure. eNOS activation by VEGF can occur either through the
activation of PI3K subsequent to autophosphorylation of Tyr794
on Flt-1 or through a PLC dependent manner downstream of
KDR/Flk-1 autophosphorylation of Tyr951. Once activated, both
pathways converge on Akt phosphorylation of eNOS, releasing
nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Other reported interaction
between Tyr951 and VRAP (and subsequent recruitment of PI3K
or PLC) or Tyr1175 and PLC may also contribute to KDR/
