During the past decade, Nav1.5, the main voltage-gated Na
+ channel in the heart, has been shown to be involved in many cardiac diseases.
Genetic variants in the gene SCN5A, encodingNav1.5, have been linked to various cardiac phenotypes, such as the congenital and acquired longQT
syndromes, Brugada syndrome, conduction slowing, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and even cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. This
unexpected phenotypic diversity may reflect that Nav1.5 is not only restricted to the initiation of the action potential and rapid cardiac conduction,
but may also be involved in other, not-yet elucidated, functions. Despite the fact that our understanding of the regulation of expression, localization,
and function of Nav1.5 is deepening, we are still far from a comprehensive view.Much of our current knowledge has been obtained by carrying out
experiments using “cellular expression systems”, e.g. host cells expressing exogenous Nav1.5. Although very informative, these techniques are
limited, in that Nav1.5 is not expressed in the physiological cellular environment of a cardiac cell. Recently, however, there have been several
studies published which used approaches closer to “normal” or pathological physiology.
In an attempt to summarize recently published data, this article will review the phenotypes of genetically-modified mouse strains where Nav1.5
expression and activity are directly or indirectly modified, as well as the regulation of Nav1.5 function using native cardiac myocytes. Despite
obvious limitations, the reviewed studies provide an overview of the complex multi-factorial and multi-protein regulation of Nav1.5.

The voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.5 initiates the cardiac
action potential (AP) of the “working” myocardium, is
essential for conduction of the electrical impulse, and is also
known to control the AP duration [1]. More recently, its
contribution to the sino-atrial node pacemaker function has
also been demonstrated [2]. Nav1.5 is the principal Na
+
channel isoform expressed in cardiomyocytes. Other isoforms
of the Nav family are also expressed in the heart, although their
contribution to the cardiac physiology is still poorly
understood [3]. In terms of its biophysical properties, Nav1.5
can be found in three states: closed at resting membrane
potential (about −85 mV), open upon depolarization, and in⁎ Tel.: +41 21 6925364; fax: +41 21 6935355.

these states depends mainly on transmembrane voltage
difference, time, and temperature. Recovery from the
inactivated state occurs during repolarisation of the membrane
during diastole. Fast depolarization of the myocyte (upstroke
of the AP) and conduction both depend on the availability of
Nav1.5 (i.e. amount of channels in the closed state) [4]. Entry
into the inactivated state is very fast (b1 ms) and for most
channels, this inactivated state is very stable. It has been
shown, however, that Nav1.5 channels may re-open, thus
generating a depolarizing inward current after the plateau
phase of the AP [5]. This phenomenon may underlie the
shortening of the AP duration caused by tetrodotoxin observed
in Purkinje fibres and myocytes [6].
Since 1995, more than 170 naturally-occurring genetic
variants in SCN5A (see www.fsm.it/cardmoc/), the gene
coding for Nav1.5, have been linked to cardiac disorders,d by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 such as congenital and drug-acquired long QT syndromes
(LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), conduction disorders,
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sinus dysfunction,
atrial fibrillation [7,8], and dilated cardiomyopathy [9]. This
long list of phenotypes may suggest that Nav1.5 is not only
restricted to the initiation and conduction of the AP, but may
also be related to other more subtle functions.
Nav1.5 is a glycosylated membrane protein with a mo-
lecular weight of ∼220 kDa and consists of 2015 or 2016
amino acids (depending on the splice variant) [10]. The protein
is made up of four homologous domains (DI to DIV, Fig. 1),
each with six transmembrane segments (S1 to S6). Three
intracellular linker loops and both the N-and C-termini of the
channel are cytoplasmic. The four S4 transmembrane
segments are involved in activation gating of the channel
(Fig. 1, in green), while a cluster of three hydrophobic amino
acids in the III-IV linker, Ile-Phe-Met (IFM), are involved in
fast inactivation gating (Fig. 1, red box). In cardiac cells,
Nav1.5 associates with partner proteins which may be
anchoring/adaptor proteins, enzymes which interact with and
modify the channel, and proteins modulating the biophysical
properties of Nav1.5 upon binding (reviewed in [11]). Nav1.5
also interacts with β-subunits (∼30–35 kDa, β1 to β4-
subunits, Fig. 1): one transmembrane-domain proteins in-
volved in different aspects of Nav1.5 function [12].
The precise localization of Nav1.5 in cardiac cells is
somewhat controversial. It is recognized that a pool of Nav1.5
is located at the specialized cell-cell junctions known as the
intercalated disks [13,14]. The localization of Nav1.5 in lateral
membranes and t-tubules, however, is still debated [14–17]. In
dog myocytes, Nav channels (most likely Nav1.5) have also
been observed in the endoplasmic reticulum [18].
During recent years, our understanding of the regulation
of expression, localization, function and role of Nav1.5 inFig. 1. Schematic membrane topology of Nav1.5, the pore-forming subdiseases has grown rapidly. A large amount of this
knowledge has been obtained by carrying out experiments
using “cellular expression systems” (host cells) such as
Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293
cells which “heterologously” express wild-type and mutant
Nav1.5 [19]. Although very informative, these techniques are
limited by the fact that the sodium channel protein is not
processed in its physiological cellular context. Studies using
approaches closer to the “normal” or pathological physiol-
ogy have recently been published. The scope of this review is
restricted to the discussion of recent findings obtained by (1)
investigating the phenotypes of genetically-modified mouse
strains, where Nav1.5 is directly or indirectly modified, and
(2) studying the regulation of Nav1.5 function using
“homologous” expression of the channel in cardiac cells.
For prior studies there are several excellent review articles
[20–23].
2. Mouse models with altered function of Nav1.5
Despite initial scepticism related to the fact that the
cardiac electrophysiological characteristics of the mouse are
strikingly different than those of humans [24], important and
informative Nav1.5-related studies using genetically-modi-
fied mouse models have recently been published.
2.1. Nav1.5 knock-out mouse studies
Homozygous knock-out (KO) Scn5a mouse embryos die
during mid-gestation, most likely due to the severe cardiac
malformations identified [25]. This helps illustrate the
essential role of Nav1.5 in cardiac development. As one
might expect, heterozygous KO mice (Scn5a+/−) mainly
display slow atrial, atrio-ventricular (AV), and intra-ventricularunit of the cardiac sodium channel and its associated β-subunits.

 conduction, as well as increased inducibility of ventricular
arrhythmias [25]. Following this initial report [25], several
studies investigating the consequences of decreased Nav1.5
expression were published. Royer and co-workers [26]
reported that Scn5a+/− mice display an age-dependent
deterioration of the global conduction properties associated
with the manifestation of fibrosis in the ventricular myocar-
dium. In certain aspects, this phenotype mimics Lenègre-Lev
disease, a progressive cardiac conduction disorder [27]. These
findings raised the question as to whether fibrosis might be the
consequence of a loss of function of Nav1.5, as recently
suggested in humans in the context of BrS [28,29]. Fibrosis, as
well as disruption of the cellular distribution of connexin-43,
seems to underlie this age-dependent conduction slowing [30].
Recent evidence [31] shows that the slowed AV conduction in
Scn5a+/−mice [26] depends on the expression ofNav1.5 inAV
node input and output regions. Finally, the role of Nav1.5 in
modulating sinus node automaticity has also beendemonstrated
in Scn5a+/− mice [32]. Altogether, these studies underline the
importance of the Nav1.5-mediated inward current in cardiac
automaticity and conduction.
2.2. Nav1.5 knock-in or transgenic mouse models mimicking
human diseases
The generation of knock-in (KI) or transgenic mice
harbouring mutant SCN5A alleles is a powerful method for
examining the consequences of a human SCN5A mutation in
a physiological context. Three such mouse lines that have
been recently produced are discussed below.
2.2.1. SCN5A mutation Δ1505-1507KPQ
Most of the mutations of Nav1.5 found in congenital
LQTS patients (defining the LQTS type 3) alter the fast
inactivation process of the channel [33], thereby inducing a
persistent inward depolarizing current during the AP plateau
phase. Consequently, the repolarisation of the AP is delayed
and leads to congenital LQTS. The deletion of three amino
acids (Δ1505-1507KPQ) of Nav1.5 was the first SCN5A
mutation which lead to a Nav1.5 persistent current [34]. In
2001, the first KI ΔKPQ mouse model was generated [35].
This study confirmed that in myocytes, LQT-3 mutant
Nav1.5 channels generate a persistent current and prolong the
AP; while in vivo the expression of mutant channels,
increase the QT interval duration of the ECG. Increased
arrhythmogenicity, illustrated by spontaneous polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia (VT), was also reported [35]. More
recently, a similar ΔKPQ mouse line was created [36] and
the results obtained were consistent with the previous study
[35]. These two mouse lines allowed the investigation of
anti-arrhythmic procedures and drugs. Results showed that,
consistent with clinical data, β-blockers failed [36]; whereas
mexiletine (Nav blocker) and rapid pacing could suppress
VT [37]. It is mainly thought that the LQT-3 arrhythmogenic
phenotype depends on early after-depolarisations (EAD)
caused by the prolonged AP [38], however, in a recent study[39] the occurrence of so-called delayed after-depolarisations
(i.e. after full repolarisation of the AP) was clearly
demonstrated in myocytes of theΔKPQ mouse. This finding
suggests that this additional mechanism may contribute to
the severity of arrhythmias seen in LQT-3. The LQT-3
genotype, although less frequent, is often more lethal [40].
Finally, a puzzling finding of these two first studies [35,36] is
that the INa recorded from individual KI myocytes was about
2-fold larger that wild-type controls. This was not the case,
however, in another recent study [39]. The reason for this
discrepancy remains to be clarified.
2.2.2. SCN5A mutation 1795insD
SCN5A mutations lead not only to many different
pathologic phenotypes [9], but also to combinations of
these phenotypes, known as “overlap syndromes” [41–43].
The reasons for these overlapping phenotypes are not
completely understood. It is thought, however, that at a
slow heart rate the late-current dependent AP prolongation is
responsible for LQTS, whereas at a high heart rate
conduction slowing (because of reduced availability of
Nav1.5) underlies the BrS phenotype. Remme and co-
workers [44] recently generated a KI mouse line expressing
the 1795insD SCN5A mutation (insertion of an aspartic acid
in locus 1795, 1798 in mouse Scn5a), which has been shown
to cause both LQTS and BrS in one large Dutch family [43].
The detailed phenotyping of this mouse line showed that
expression of the 1795insD channel recapitulates many of
the pathological features seen in patients, such as: bradycar-
dia, conduction slowing because of decreased INa, and
delayed repolarisation caused by the mutation-induced
persistent INa. This study clearly illustrates the benefits of
mouse models for the study of specific human arrhythmias
resulting from Nav1.5 dysfunction.
2.2.3. SCN5A mutation N1325S
The SCN5A mutation N1325S causes LQT-3 syndrome
[45], and like many similar mutations, leads to an increased
persistent current [46]. The generation of a transgenic mouse
line enabling demonstration of the phenotypes of LQTS, VT,
and sudden death [46], permitted researchers to investigate
alternative arrhythmogenic mechanisms [45]. Experiments
using isolated myocytes and performing AP recordings
showed that, at heart rates with cycle length ≤500 ms, AP
alternans and instability (i.e. large variability in AP duration)
were clearly observed [45]. Interestingly, the Ca2+channel
blocker verapamil reduced this AP instability, suggesting an
involvement of intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation in this
phenomenon. Altogether, these studies illustrate that the
mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenicity in LQT-3 may be
multifold and mutation dependent.
2.3. Dystrophin-deficient mice
Similar to other ion channels, Nav1.5 has been reported to
be part of the dystrophinmulti-protein complex [47]. Recently,

 using a “pull-down” approach, our group showed that Nav1.5
is interacting via adaptor proteins, called syntrophins, with
dystrophin [48]. This interaction depends on the PDZ domain-
bindingmotif on the C-terminus of Nav1.5 [11]. In dystrophin-
deficient mice (mdx5cv), an animal model of Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, Nav1.5 protein level was reduced in
ventricular lysates, leading to reduced cellular INa and
conduction defects that were documented via ECGs. The
detailedmechanisms bywhich a lack of dystrophin reduces the
expression of Nav1.5 protein without altering the mRNA level
[48], remain to be explored. Whether the decreased expression
of Nav1.5 plays a direct role in, or is the consequence of, the
degenerative cardiomyopathy seen in Duchenne patients is
still unanswered. Another intriguing question raised by these
findings is related to the fact that dystrophin has been shown to
be absent from the intercalated disks of human [49] and rat [50]
cardiomyocytes, where a fraction of Nav1.5 is clearly present
[14]. These observations suggest that at least two pools of
Nav1.5 channels co-exist at the plasma membrane of cardiac
cells. One pool, localized in lateral membranes, may belong to
the dystrophin complex; whereas another pool resides at the
intercalated disks. In the latter pool, the PDZ domain-binding
motif of Nav1.5 may be associated with other proteins, either
via syntrophin (e.g. utrophin) or other PDZ-domain proteins.
Baba and co-workers [16] recently showed that dog
cardiomyocytes isolated from infarcted zones displayed a
reduced INa density, associated with a marked loss of the
Nav1.5 staining in the lateral membranes only. In contrast, the
Nav1.5 staining remained unchanged in the intercalated disks.
This leads one to believe that this lateral dystrophin-dependent
pool of Nav1.5 may be more sensitive to specific pathological
insults (in this case ischemia) than the intercalated-disk pool.
2.4. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
Phosphorylation of Nav1.5 by Ca
2+/calmodulin-depen-
dent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has recently been reported
[51]. CaMKII is a widely expressed serine/threonine kinase
which transduces intracellular Ca2+increase into phosphor-
ylation of multiple proteins, including ion channels [52].
Importantly, CaMKIIδc has been shown to be up-regulated
in human and animal heart failure models (reviewed in [53]).
Wagner and co-workers [51] showed that CaMKIIδc is co-
localized and can be co-immunoprecipited with Nav1.5 in
cardiac tissues, although the mode of interaction has not yet
been investigated. Over-expression of CaMKIIδc in rabbit
myocytes and transgenic mice altered several biophysical
properties of Nav1.5. In summary, CaMKII-dependent
phosphorylation of Nav1.5 shifted the steady-state inactiva-
tion curve towards negative voltages in a Ca2+-dependent
manner, slowed the recovery from inactivation, and
markedly increased the persistent current (as seen with
LQT-3 mutant Nav1.5 channels). Overall, at rapid heart rate,
these alterations decrease the availability of INa; while at
slower heart rate, the persistent current-dependent prolon-
gation of repolarisation predominates. Interestingly, thisbiophysical phenotype is similar to the one seen in patients
and mice carrying the 1795insD mutation (see 2.2.2). These
results are supported by the observation that VT could be
generated in mice over-expressing CaMKII while showing
signs of heart failure [51]. Overall, it is likely that CaMKII
plays a prominent role in heart failure-dependent arrhyth-
mias involving Nav1.5. However, more direct evidence is
needed in order to confirm this hypothesis.
2.5. Transgenic over-expression of Nav1.5
What are the consequences of over-expressing Nav1.5?
Despite the fact that the cardiac Nav1.5 transcript and protein
levels were increased by about 10-fold in a SCN5A
transgenic mouse line [54], no increase of INa and AP
duration of atrial and ventricular cells was observed. These
surprising findings suggest that there may be intrinsic
mechanisms avoiding “overloading” of the cardiac cell
membrane with Nav1.5. Does it mean that cardiac cells are
able to “sense” the number of Nav1.5 at the cell membrane?
Or, is the cell membrane under normal conditions “saturated”
with Nav1.5? These are open questions that merit further
study. Finally, these Nav1.5 over-expressing mice displayed
a very mild shortening of the P-wave and PQ-interval
duration [54]; a finding that is not easily explained due to the
lack of effects at the cellular level.
2.6. Transgenic mice over-expressing the protein phosphatase
calcineurin
Protein phosphatase calcineurin plays a central role in
cardiac hypertrophy [55]. Interestingly, progressive conduc-
tion defects leading to complete cardiac conduction block,
associated with episodes of VT, were observed in transgenic
mice over-expressing a constitutive active form of calcineurin
[56]. This phenotype was later shown to be due to a profound
reduction of INa [57]. This INa decrease was age-dependent in
that at 50 days of age, the recorded current was virtually
abolished. Guo and co-workers [57] addressed the issue of
howmice can survive with such a small INa in their discussion.
This strong INa down-regulation can also be obtained by
infecting neonatal myocytes with adenovirus encoding a
constitutive active form of calcineurin [57]. Interestingly, there
was clear evidence that intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis was
involved in this process since thapsigargin, ryanodine and the
Ca2+ chelating agent AM-BAPTA were all successful in
counteracting the effects of calcineurin over-expression.
Involvement of PKC in this process was also suggested
because bisindolylmaleimide I antagonized the effects of
calcineurin, a finding that is consistent with previous
observations showing PKC-dependent down-regulation of
INa [58]. The biochemical expression of Nav1.5 was not altered
in calcineurin-mice; whereas non-stationary noise analysis
(a biophysical approach to evaluate the number of channels
active at the cell surface) clearly showed a reduced density
of Na+channels [57]. These in vivo results indicate that

nloaded from
 intracellular Ca2+ and PKC are involved in regulation of
Nav1.5 trafficking, but the detailed molecular mechanisms are
not yet understood.
2.7. Transgenic mice over-expressing Snail, a transcription
factor
The Snail genes are transcription factors involved in the
regulation of expression of many genes; in particular, many
of the proteins of the cell-cell junctions are repressed by
Snail [59]. In a mouse model of cardiac-specific over-
expression of Snail, the phenotype of severe dilated
cardiomyopathy and significant conduction defects was
observed [60]. The INa recorded in the cardiomyocytes of
these transgenic hearts was only about 10% of the wild-type
current. The authors also showed that Snail protein is capable
of interacting with the promoter region of SCN5A resulting
in repression of expression in a heterologous expression
system. Although suggested to be the case in humans [61], it
remains to be determined whether the decreased expression
of Nav1.5 is the cause of the dilated cardiomyopathy seen in
this mouse model.
3. Molecular regulation of Nav1.5 in cardiomyocytes
In the following sections, recent results regarding
molecular aspects of Nav1.5 regulation in native cardiomyo-
cytes are discussed.
3.1. Ankyrin proteins bind to and regulate Nav1.5
Ankyrin proteins, encoded by three distinct genes ANK1-
3, anchor membrane proteins to the actin and spectrin
cytoskeleton [62]. In the heart, both ankyrin-B (encoded by
ANK2) and ankyrin-G (encoded by ANK3) are expressed
[62], and both are reported to be involved in different types
of cardiac arrhythmias. In humans, many genetic variants of
ANK2 are linked to diverse pathological phenotypes such as
LQTS type 4 [63], drug-induced LQTS, and sudden cardiac
death, giving rise to the “ankyrin-B cardiac syndrome” [64].
However, there is no direct evidence that Nav1.5 is regulated
by ankyrin-B, even though it was reported that in neonatal
mouse cardiomyocytes KO for ankyrin-B, cardiac Na+chan-
nels display late openings similar to the ones seen in Nav1.5
LQT-3 mutant channels [65]. In contrast, ankyrin-G directly
interacts with a specific ankyrin-binding motif of the linker
loop between domain II and III [66]. Mohler and co-workers
described a BrS patient with a SCN5A mutation (E1053 K)
in this motif which disrupted the interaction between Nav1.5
and ankyrin-B [17]. Using an elegant technique involving
lentiviral vectors, the authors [17] were able to express
tagged Nav1.5 channels in adult rat myocytes. Whereas wild-
type channels trafficked normally to the intercalated disks
and lateral membranes, E1053 K channels remained in the
cytoplasm of infected myocytes [17]. These results suggest
that ankyrin-G may not only act as an anchoring protein forNav1.5, but that it may also participate in its correct
trafficking and sorting. These interesting finding are not
yet fully understood and demand further study.
3.2. Role of caveolin-3 in regulating Nav1.5
Caveolin-3 is an important component of small invagina-
tions of the plasma membrane called caveolae, in which a
variety of signalling molecules and ion channels are enriched
[67]. CAV3, the gene encoding caveolin-3, is known to be
mutated in neuromuscular diseases such as limb-girdle
muscular dystrophy and rippling-muscle disease [68], and
more recently in patients with congenital LQTS (LQT-9) [69]
and SIDS [70]. Nav1.5 can be co-immunoprecipitated with
caveolin-3 fromnative tissue [71], and alsowhen co-expressed
in HEK293 cells [69]. Furthermore, both proteins are co-
localized [69,71,72]. Interestingly, dystrophin is also a
component of caveolae [73]. This raises the possibility that
the interaction with Nav1.5 may be indirect via proteins of the
dystrophinmulti-protein complex,which aremainly expressed
in the lateral membranes. The role of the Nav1.5/caveolin-3
interaction is somewhat puzzling. Co-expression of Nav1.5
with the mutants of caveolin-3 found in LQTS and SIDS
patients significantly increased the persistent late current in
HEK293 cells, a molecular phenotype consistent with the
clinical features [69,70]. In rat cardiac myocytes, however, a
robust rapid increase of INa in response to β-adrenergic
stimulation by isoproterenol, (PKA-independent due to the
presence of a PKA inhibitor) was completely abolished by
anti-caveolin 3 antibodies dialysed into the myocytes [71].
Shibata and co-workers [72] proposed that a pool of Nav1.5
channels are located in caveolar compartments that are not in
contact with the extracellular side of the myocytes. β-
adrenergic stimulation, in a PKA-independent but Gαs-
dependent manner, opens the caveolae and thus increases the
number of Nav1.5 channels at the cell surface. This attractive
model demands further study at the molecular level, since the
role of caveolin-3 and its interaction with Nav1.5 remains
unclear.
Finally, in transgenic mice with a Duchenne muscle
dystrophy phenotype where caveolin-3 is over-expressed, a
decrease in dystrophin and its associated proteins are
observed not only in muscle but also in the heart [74]. The
cardiac phenotype of these mice is characterized by a fibrotic
cardiomyopathy with prolongation of the QRS interval
similar to the heterozygous SCN5A-KO mice. Altogether,
these results illustrate the important, but not yet completely
understood, role of caveolar Nav1.5.
3.3. Nav β-subunits regulating Nav1.5
Nav channels have been shown to be associated with
regulatory β-subunits [12], one-segment transmembrane
proteins (Fig. 1). Four genes encoding voltage-gated sodium
channel β-subunits (β1–β4) are found in the human
genome. The roles of these β-subunits are multiple and

 often, controversial (as is the case for Nav1.5— reviewed in
[12]). This problem may be due to the fact that groups have
been testing the β-subunits in different types of cellular
expression systems. Among the different functions of β-
subunits, Isom's group showed that when using mouse total
cardiac or cardiomyocyte lysates [75] β1 and β2 subunits
associate with ankyrin-G and ankyrin-B. It was previously
shown that the β1/ankyrin interactions are regulated by the
phosphorylation state of a tyrosine residue located in the
intracellular part of the protein [76]. Using a phosphospecific
antibody, it was shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated β1 are
located at the intercalated disks, and that non-phosphorylated
proteins are in the lateral membranes [75]. In addition,
Nav1.5 channels of the intercalated disk-pool were shown to
not only colocalize with phosphotyrosin-β1, but also with
connexin-43 (a well-known intercalated disk protein) and N-
cadherin [75]. A more detailed discussion of this potential
multiprotein complex can be found in [12].
Thus far, in vivo evidence for a Nav β-subunit-dependent
regulation of Nav1.5 is scarce, but the findings reported in
two recent studies suggest it plays an important role. In a
large family with congenital LQTS, a mutation in the gene
coding for β4 Nav subunit was found to co-segregate with
the long QT phenotype [77]. In HEK293 cells, co-expression
of mutant β4 significantly increased the Nav1.5-dependent
persistent current, consistent with the LQTS phenotype [77].
In another study investigating the phenotype of β1 null mice,
it was reported that they exhibit a significantly longer QT
interval compared to wild-type mice [78]. Further investi-
gation of this interesting phenotype is pending.
3.4. Protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of Nav1.5
In cardiac cells, PKA is mainly activated upon β-
adrenergic receptor stimulation, leading to an increase in
intracellular cyclic AMP [79]. The role of this pathway in
regulating Nav1.5, respectively INa, has been studied for
many years (reviewed in [80]), resulting in many published
discordant results. In more recent studies [81–84], it has
been consistently reported that upon PKA activation an acute
time-dependent increase of INa was observed, with slight or
no alterations in its biophysical characteristics. Boyden's
group [81] published the only recent study using cardoio-
myocytes to investigate this phenomenon. By incubating dog
cardiomyocytes with a PKA-activating cocktail (membrane-
permeable cAMP, IBMX and forskolin), the authors
observed a 30% increase in INa; whereas cells close to the
infarcted zone showed a reduced increase. Chloroquine pre-
treatment blunted this PKA-dependent increase, leading the
authors to conclude that part of these effects depend on
“vesicular trafficking” [81]. PKA-dependent enhancement of
trafficking of Nav1.5 can also be monitored in HEK293 cells
expressing GFP-tagged channels [82]. A detailed analysis
using these cells suggested the presence of a sub-membrane
population of Nav1.5 redistributing into the plasma mem-
brane upon PKA activation. The authors proposed that thelocation of these channels beneath the membrane and their
PKA-dependent translocation may be consistent with the
opening of “silent” caveolae hypothesis [72] (see 3.2).
Although very appealing, the molecular aspects of the PKA-
dependent trafficking model as well as the effects of adrener-
gic stimulation in regulating INa are still largely unknown.
3.5. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Nav1.5
Functional regulation of ion channels via tyrosine
phosphorylation has been shown to be very important [85].
In two recent studies [86,87], tyrosine phosphorylation of
native cardiac Nav1.5 was demonstrated using anti-phos-
photyrosine antibodies probing immunoprecipitated Nav1.5.
Moreover, it was found that isolated rat cardiomyocytes
showed increased INa upon stimulation by epidermal growth
factor receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase. This response was
potentiated by orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase
inhibitor [87]. Interestingly Ahern and co-workers [86]
reported that in HEK293 cells the tyrosine kinase Fyn
modulated several biophysical properties of Nav1.5. In
addition, our group recently reported [88] that protein
tyrosine phosphatase PTPH1 interacts with the same PDZ-
domain binding motif of Nav1.5 (as described for syntrophin
proteins-see above). It is possible that the proper function of
Nav1.5 is dependent on the balance between protein tyrosine
kinase and phosphatase activities in cardiac cells. However,
the physiological relevance of these observations remains to
be fully determined.
3.6. Regulation of Nav1.5 by the adenosine monophosphate-
activated protein kinase (AMPK)
AMPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in
sensing the metabolic status of the cell [89]. Several recent
studies (reviewed in [90]) demonstrated that mutations in the
γ2 regulatory subunit of AMPK lead to a complex cardiac
phenotype displaying, alone or in combination, ventricular
pre-excitation (Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome), conduc-
tion defect, and cardiac hypertrophy. Light and co-workers
over-expressed a constitutive active form of AMPK in rat
ventricular myocytes [91] and observed, among other
alterations, a significant increase of the persistent INa with
a prolongation of the AP leading to EADs. Whether AMPK-
dependent regulation of Nav1.5 can be seen in vivo has yet to
be studied.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
Since the beginning of cellular electrophysiology studies,
the cardiac INa has been the focus of many scientists and
laboratories [92]. During the past decade, this field has
received a strong impetus due to the description of many
naturally-occurring mutations in the Nav1.5 gene which lead
to severe cardiac disease. Initially, most of these studies were
performed using “expression systems”, and in many cases

 the mutation-induced alterations of Nav1.5 were easily
elucidated and extrapolated to their clinical phenotypes.
This approach, however, is not without limitations. For
instance, although the BrS E1053K mutant channels
displayed no trafficking defect in HEK293 cells, they were
not routed to the cell membrane in cardiomyocytes [17].
Another illustrative example is the case of the BrS mutation
T1620M; depending on the expression system used (oocytes
vs. HEK293 cells), the molecular phenotypes were found to
be contradictory to one another [93]. We are now in a new
era where there is an important effort undertaken to develop
experimental models that more closely mimic human
physiological condition. Two main approaches have been
used, the results of which have been reviewed in this article.
These studies have been investigating genetically-modified
mouse models and used sophisticated cell biology techni-
ques applicable to isolated cardiomyocytes. Both techniques
remain very labour intensive, time consuming, and are
mastered by only a few laboratories. It is without doubt,
however, that many of the questions remaining about the role
and regulation of Nav1.5 will only be adequately addressed
by using such modern genetic, molecular, and cell biology
techniques. A few of the unsolved issues are for example: the
physiological relevance of the proteins shown to associate
and regulate Nav1.5 in mammalian cell lines, i.e. fibroblast
growth factor homologous factor 1B [94], 14-3-3 protein
[95], calmodulin [96,97], and Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases [98];
and also the possibility that Nav1.5 is part of different multi-
protein complexes located at the intercalated disks or the
lateral membranes. It can be forseen that these future studies
will help elucidate the multiple and complex roles of Nav1.5
in cardiac physiology and disease.
