ABSTRACT
We have created a hybrid i-motif composed of two
DNA and two peptide nucleic acid (PNA) strands
from an equimolar mixture of a C-rich DNA and
analogous PNA sequence. Nano-electrospray ion-
ization mass spectrometry confirmed the forma-
tion of a tetrameric species, composed of PNA–DNA
heteroduplexes. Thermal denaturation and CD
experiments revealed that the structure was held
together by C-H1-C base pairs. High resolution NMR
spectroscopy confirmed that PNA and DNA form a
unique complex comprising five C-H1-C base pairs
per heteroduplex. The imino protons are protected
from D2O exchange suggesting intercalation of the
heteroduplexes as seen in DNA4 i-motifs. FRET
established the relative DNA and PNA strand polar-
ities in the hybrid. The DNA strands were arranged
antiparallel with respect to one another. The
same topology was observed for PNA strands.
Fluorescence quenching revealed that both PNA–
DNA parallel heteroduplexes are intercalated, such
that both DNA strands occupy one of the narrow
grooves. H10–H10 NOEs show that both hetero-
duplexes are fully intercalated and that both DNA
strands are disposed towards a narrow groove,
invoking sugar–sugar interactions as seen in DNA4
i-motifs. The hybrid i-motif shows enhanced thermal
stability, intermediate pH dependence and forms
at relatively low concentrations making it an ideal
nanoscale structural element for pH-based molecu-
lar switches. It also serves as a good model system
to assess the contribution of sugar–sugar contacts
in i-motif tetramerization.
INTRODUCTION
Oligonucleotides having tandem repeats of cytosine have
been shown to associate under acidic conditions to form a tet-
rameric structure called the i-motif (1). The i-motif consists
of two parallel stranded duplexes that are intercalated in an
antiparallel orientation. Each parallel duplex is held together
via C-H.C+ base pairs that are formed by hemi-protonation of
the cytosine bases at acidic pH. Oligonucleotide fragments
from naturally occurring sequences in the human genome
have been shown to form the i-motif suggesting that this
unique structural motif could possibly be biologically relev-
ant. Several such sequences form intramolecular and inter-
molecular i-motifs in vitro. Tetrahymena thermophila and
human telomeric repeats form tetramolecular i-motifs (2,3).
Double and quadruple repeats of the tetrahymena and
human telomeric C-rich strand also form bimolecular and
unimolecular i-motifs, respectively (4–7). In addition, centro-
meric sequences have been shown to form bimolecular
i-motifs (8). The human insulin minisatellite (9) and the
human centromeric satellite (10) also form unimolecular
i-motif structures. Select non-telomeric and non-centromeric
sequences, such as the fragile X repeat, also fold into intra-
molecular i-motifs (11) (Chart 1).
Non-DNA based C-rich sequences have also been shown
to form i-motifs. DNA phosphorothioate analogues, but not
methyl phosphonate analogues, were also capable of i-motif
formation (12). C-rich RNA-based i-motifs had gone
undetected till recently due to the low stability of RNA-
based i-motifs (13). Along these lines, i-motifs from peptide
nucleic acids (PNAs) had also gone undetected until recently
due to its stringent pH requirements for i-motif formation
(14). Another analogue of PNA, called Alanyl PNA was also
capable of forming i-motifs in the presence of an appropriate
chiral partner (15). Such studies using structural analogues of
the DNA backbone have provided useful information regard-
ing the key backbone structural requirements for i-motif
formation. The investigations on modified backbones have
mainly implicated the role of DNA sugar–sugar interactions
in stabilizing the i-motif. However, there has been no direct
measurement yet of the effect of the deoxyribose phosphate
backbone in bringing about tetramerization in solution.
PNA are one of the most widely used synthetic mimics
of DNA. PNA can form a variety of non-covalent complexes
analogous to their parent DNA complexes. Some of its well
characterized non-covalent complexes include PNA–PNA
(16), PNA–RNA (17), and PNA–DNA duplexes (18),
PNA–PNA–PNA (19) and PNA–DNA–PNA triplexes (20).

Recently, it has been shown that PNA can form tetramolecu-
lar (21) as well as bimolecular G-quadruplexes (22,23). It has
also been shown that PNA can, in association with DNA,
form a hybrid G-quadruplex, which has several functional
implications (24). We and others have recently shown that
PNA can also form the i-motif, and that this structure has
very different properties compared to its DNA analogue
(14,25). Given the current interest in the i-motif as a struc-
tural element in nanotechnology as evidenced by the deve-
lopment of various molecular switches (26,27), we wanted
to create an alternative hybrid structure that preserves the
gross features of the DNA i-motif, but with different physico–
chemical characteristics. Since both DNA and PNA form
i-motifs, and since PNA forms a variety of non-covalent
hybrid complexes with DNA, we wanted to see if one
could create a hybrid i-motif from a mixture of DNA and
PNA that would possibly have characteristics different from
either of the parent structures.
We have used nano-electrospray ionization mass spectro-
metry to show that a 1:1 mixture of PNA and DNA form a
tetramer and that this tetramer is formed from two hemi-
protonated PNA–DNA duplexes. pH dependent stability stud-
ies by ultraviolet (UV) and CD spectroscopy showed that
the hybrid was most stable at a pH ¼ pKa on N3 of cytosine
indicating that the hybrid was held together by C-H+C base
pairs. High resolution NMR revealed that there were five
such C-H+C base pairs in the complex and that the complex
was C2-symmetric. These imino protons were protected from
D2O exchange, indicating intercalation of the PNA–DNA
duplexes to form a solvent shielded inner core as seen in
DNA4 i-motifs. The relative strand polarities of PNA and
DNA in the C2-symmetric hybrid i-motif were addressed
using Homo-FRET and fluorescence quenching. These sug-
gested that the PNA strands were arranged head-to-tail with
respect to each other, as were the DNA strands. Further, the
heteroduplexes intercalated such that both DNA backbones
were closest to each other. 2D NMR confirmed these findings
and indicated that the DNA backbones were close enough
to invoke sugar–sugar contacts as seen in DNA4 i-motifs.
In order to evaluate the physico–chemical characteristics of
the hybrid i-motif, we have performed thermal melting stud-
ies and validated these by analogous circular dichroism (CD)
studies under a variety of conditions. Our studies show that
in comparison with either of the parent i-motifs the hybrid
has intermediate pH dependence, greater thermal stability
and formed at far lower concentrations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PNA synthesis and characterization
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified
d(TC5), 5
0-TMR and 30-TMR labeled d(TC5) were purchased
from Sigma–Genosys and used without further purification.
PNA monomers and PNA coupling reagents were obtained
from Applied Biosystems (Cheshire, UK). Wang resin
pre loaded with e-N(Mtt) protected Lys were obtained from
Novabiochem. Flurophores were obtained from Invitrogen,
UK. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich
unless otherwise stated. PNA synthesis was performed
using standard solid phase Fmoc chemistry on Nova Syn
TGA resin using analytical grade reagents and Milli-Q
water where applicable. Protecting groups and PNA probes
were cleaved from the resin simultaneously using 95:2.5:2.5
TFA/Water/TIS. The cleaved mixture was evaporated under
reduced pressure and precipitated using dry ether. The pre-
cipitate was dissolved in water and subjected to purification
by RP-HPLC using a CH3CN/H2O gradient starting from
5/95 v/v CH3CN/H2O to 100/0 v/v CH3CN/H2O over
42 min. ESI-MS p(C5T): [M+2H]2+ 834.99 (calc. 835.37),
[M+3H]3+ 556.91 (calc. 557.25). p(C5T) was stored as a
2 mM aqueous solution at 4C.
N-TMR-p(C5T): PNA synthesis was carried out using
standard solid phase Fmoc chemistry on Nova Syn TGA
resin using the above protocol. S-Trt-protected cysteine was
then incorporated at N-terminus. The trityl (Trt) group was
removed by treatment with 5:1:44 TFA/TIS/CH2Cl2 for 2 h,
followed by washing with CH2Cl2 and dry DMF. 1.5 equiv.
of TMR-5-maleimide in presence of 3 equiv. DIPEA was
added to the resin and stirred for 2.5 h. The N-terminal
Fmoc was removed by treatment with 20% piperidine in

p(C5T): [M+4H]4+ 564.18 (calc. 564.9).
N-Dabcyl-p(C5T): PNA synthesis was carried out using

e-N(Mtt) protected Lys-Fmoc was incorporated at N-terminus
in order to attach the Dabcyl group. Post attachment, the
Fmoc group was removed by treatment with 20% piperidine/
DMF. Dabcyl succinimidyl ester (3 equiv.) in presence of
10 equiv. of DIPEA was added to the resin and stirred
for 6 h. The labeled PNA was cleaved and purified as
described earlier. N-Dabcyl-PNA was characterized by posit-
ive ion ESI-MS: N-Dabcyl-p(C5T): [M+2H]2+ 1024.98 (calc.
1025.17) and [M+3H]3+ 683.65 (calc. 684.71).
TMR was attached at the 30 end of d(TC5) using a C7
linker employing thiol maleimide chemistry to give
30-TMR-d(TC5). TMR was attached to the 50-end of
d(TC5) through a C6 linker using succinimidyl chemistry
to give 50-TMR-d(TC5).
Native gel electrophoresis
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies were performed
using the TMR labeled DNA oligomers. Samples at 50 mM
strand concentration were prepared by mixing equimolar
30-TMR-d(TC5) and unlabeled p(C5T) following the protocol
described earlier. A total of 20% of polyacrylamide (Sigma)
gels were used to assess the mobility of different structures.
Robinson–Britton buffer (pH 4.5) was used to make the
gels and was also used as the running buffer. All gels were
run at 70 V for 6 h at 4C. Orange-G (Sigma) was used as
a tracking dye. Fluorescently labeled bands were visualized
using Ethidium Bromide filter.
Nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(Nano ESI-MS)
All mass spectrometry were performed on Micromass ESI-
MS Q-TOF Ultima Mass Spectrometer (Manchester, UK)
with micro-channel plate detector. Nano ESI-MS spectra
were collected in positive ion mode except where mentioned.
An equimolar solution of 0.5 mM p(C5T) and 0.5 mM
d(TC5) in 30 mM sodium acetate buffer were heated to
90C, annealed to room temperature over 3 h and equilibrated
at 4C for 8 h. The parent DNA4 and PNA4 i-motifs were
prepared similarly. Just prior to injection, the equilibrated
sample was diluted 5-fold with Milli-Q water at pH 4.5
(pH adjusted with formic acid) and then loading into the
nano-flow capillary. Source temperature of 70C, capillary
voltage of 1.5 kV, cone voltage of 60 V were the source para-
meters employed during acquisition of mass spectra.
UV-visible spectrophotometric studies
Concentration dependent thermal melts. All the UV measure-
ments were done on a Varian Cary 300Bio UV-VIS spectro-
meter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. Stock
solutions of PNA and DNA were made in salt-free, Millipore
water. Samples were prepared from a stock solution of
1 mM DNA d(TC5) and 2 mM PNA p(C5T) by diluting in
30 mM Na-acetate buffer (pH 4.5), to achieve the desired
strand concentration. In the context of the hybrid i-motif,
the term strand concentration refers to the total strand
concentration corresponding to d(TC5) and p(C5T) in the
sample. To form the hybrid i-motif of desired strand con-
centration, an equimolar mixture of d(TC5) and p(C5T)
at appropriate concentrations were heated and maintained
at 90C for 10 min, cooled to 4C over 3 h at a rate of
0.5C/min and equilibrated at 4C for 8 h. The parent
PNA4 and DNA4 i-motifs were formed similarly. Melting
experiments were performed by monitoring absorbance at
295 nm from 20 to 90C using a heating rate of 0.5C/min.
Thermal denaturation experiments were performed on hybrid
i-motifs at strand concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mM.
pH dependent studies. The pH dependent thermal melts on
the hybrid i-motif were carried out at a total strand concentra-
tion of 50 mM. Samples were formed as mentioned earlier in
a buffer at the desired pH. The pH range 3–7 was investig-
ated. A total of 30 mM NaH2PO4/H3PO4 of the buffer was
used at pH 3, 30 mM CH3COONa/CH3COOH buffer was
used for the pH range 3.5–5.5 and 30 mM NaH2PO4/
Na2HPO4 buffer was used for the pH regime 6–7. The sam-
ples were also used for pH dependent CD studies (see below).
CD studies
CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO-J-720 spectrophoto-
meter where temperature control was achieved using a
water bath (Neslab RTE 100). Hybrid i-motifs at a strand
concentration of 50 mM were prepared as described earlier
in 30 mM Sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.5. This was then
diluted with buffer to give a hybrid i-motif of the desired
strand concentration for CD experiments. Spectra were recor-
ded from 330 to 220 nm and are presented at an average of
six successive scans. Finally all the spectra are subtracted
from a baseline corresponding to buffer alone. Temperature
dependent CD spectra (CD melts) were recorded on both
hybrid i-motif and DNA i-motif at a total strand concentration
of 100 mM in 30 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), at
a heating rate of 0.3C/min.
NMR experiments
All NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV-700 spectro-
meter. A total of 1 mM strand concentration in 30 mM
sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.5 was used to prepare samples
for all 1-D and proton exchange experiments whereas, for
2-D experiments 30 mM sodium acetate-d3 was used to pre-
pare samples. Water suppression was achieved using an
Excitation Sculpting solvent suppression programme (28).
For 1D experiment 132 scans were taken, the spectral band-
width was maintained at 2 KHz, with an acquisition time of
1.6 s and a 2 s recycling delay. The methyl chemical shift at
1.91 p.p.m. of Na-acetate was used as the internal standard.
For NOESY experiments, (900 · 4096) complex points
were collected, a 2 KHz spectral width was employed in
both dimensions with acquisition times of 0.1 s in t2 and
0.02 s in t1, using a 250 ms mixing time.
Fluorescence studies
Homo-FRET studies were carried out on hybrid i-motifs at
a strand concentration of 25 mM, prepared by mixing 1:1
N-TMR-p(C5T) : d(TC5) in 30 mM Sodium acetate buffer
at pH 4.5. Similarly 1:1 50- TMR-d(TC5): p(C5T) as well

as 30-TMR-d(TC5): p(C5T) were also made using the same
protocol. For fluorescence quenching, samples were made
by mixing 1:1 N-Dabcyl-p(C5T) : 3
0-TMR-d(TC5) or 1:1
N-Dabcyl-p(C5T): 5
0-TMR-d(TC5) to achieve a strand con-
centration of 25 mM using the above mentioned protocol. All
fluorescence studies were carried out on a FLUOROLOG-
SPEX spectrometer. Temperature dependent melting experi-
ments followed by Homo-FRET were done on a Corbett
Rotor GENE RT–PCR instrument, over a temperature range
of 30–90C and a heating rate of 0.5/min. All the samples
were made at 25 mM strand concentration in 30 mM sodium
acetate buffer (pH 4.5). Quenching was followed at 580 nm
after exciting TMR at 530 nm. Prior to fluorescence meas-
urement, uniformity in concentrations of the fluorescent
samples were confirmed by UV spectrometry. In order
to ensure the complete complexation of the N-TMR-
PNA strands and rule out contributions from uncomplexed
non-FRETting species, homo-FRET samples incorporated a
10% excess of unlabeled DNA strands. Similarly, 30-TMR-
DNA and 50-TMR-DNA were mixed with a 10% excess of
unlabelled PNA.
The distance between the fluorophores was calculated, with
the associated limitations of FRET, using the donor quench-
ing method (29) employing the formula E ¼ (1  FD/ FDA) ¼
1/[1 + R/R0]1/6 (for details see Supplementary Data). The
Fo¨rster distance (R0) for TMR–TMR quenching due to
homo-FRET was 44 A˚ and TMR-Dabcyl quenching was
26 A˚ consistent with the literature values (30). A coarse
gained model of the hybrid tetramer, incorporating the linkers
was constructed based on the NMR parameters of the d(TC5)
DNA4 i-motif (1) to obtain theoretical estimates of the relev-
ant distances. Anisotropy of all the fluorophores was less than
0.1 indicating that they were freely rotating (Supplementary
Data).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design consideration
The oligonucleotide d(TC5) incorporated a stretch of cyto-
sines at the 30 end where tandem C residues are shown to
potentiate tetramerization into i-motifs (31). The analogous
PNA sequence has also been shown to form i-motifs (14).
We synthesized p(C5T) by solid phase synthesis using
Fmoc chemistry (See Materials and Methods section). A T
residue was incorporated at the N-terminus in order to
prevent possible higher order structure formation. A lysine
residue was attached to C-terminus to enhance solubility of
the PNA sequence in water. Furthermore, since tetramole-
cular DNA4 and PNA4 i-motifs formed from d(TC5) and
p(C5T) are well characterized (14,31) they would prove
good markers for comparison of any hybrid i-motif formed.
Gel electrophoresis shows formation of
a hybrid complex
In order to see if a 1:1 mixture of C-rich DNA and PNA could
form a complex, various concentrations of p(C5T) were
annealed with a fixed concentration (25 mM) of 30-TMR-
d(TC5) in 30 mM Sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) as
described in the experimental section and subjected to gel
electrophoresis. Figure 1 shows the electrophoretic mobility
shift of samples incorporating p(C5T) relative to 3
0-TMR-
d(TC5) alone. For a given DNA concentration, incremental
increase in PNA concentration resulted in a complex with
electrophoretic mobility slower relative to the DNA-only
complex. In the case of both complexes, an extra band with
higher mobility was observed that we assign to breakdown
products of the slower-migrating parent complex. Thus, a
mixture of 1:1 PNA : DNA forms a complex that is distinct
from the parent DNA complex.
Nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry studies
evidence a hybrid tetramer
In order to check the molecularity of the PNA–DNA complex
evidenced by gel electrophoresis, the complex was subjected
to nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Nano
ESI-MS). An equimolar solution of p(C5T) and d(TC5) at
0.5 mM each was prepared as described in the Materials
and Methods section. An aliquot of this sample was diluted
5-fold and analyzed by non-covalent mass spectrometry to
seek evidence for complex formation. The Nano ESI mass
spectrum of this sample showed multiple peaks in m/z
regime 2320 to 2400 (Figures 1B and 2). These peaks were
equidistant, with a constant separation of 7.4 ± 0.1 m/z
units indicating that these peaks corresponded to a triply
charged species of m/z 2243.6, which was multiply sodiated.
The associated molecular weight (6730.8 ± 0.9 Da) of
this species corresponds to a four-stranded entity
([2M+2M’+10H+]3+) that is composed of two strands each
of p(C5T) and d(TC5) with ten additional protons (calc.
mol. wt. 6730.14 Da). Moreover, this molecular weight
falls exactly in between the measured molecular weights of
the respective parent DNA4 (6775.2 ± 0.6 Da) and PNA4
(6685.9 ± 1.06 Da) i-motifs that each incorporate an extra
10 additional protons, required for C-H+C base pairing. The
consistent presence of these 10 extra protons in the observed
2[p(C5T)] : 2[d(TC5)] complex suggests that the strands in
this tetramer may also be held together by C-H+C base
pairs as seen in the parent i-motifs. Importantly, peaks corres-
ponding to the DNA4 or PNA4 i-motifs (14) were completely
absent suggesting that in a 1:1 mixture of p(C5T) and
d(TC5), the formation of the homotetrameric complexes are
suppressed.

Fragmentation reveals that the tetramer is comprised of
PNA–DNA duplexes. PNA is capable of forming parallel
stranded duplexes held together by C-C+ base pairing (14).
PNA has also been shown to form Watson–Crick base paired
PNA–PNA (16) and PNA–DNA duplexes (18). Given that
the stoichiometry of PNA: DNA in the tetrameric complex
is 2:2, two possible molecular arrangements exist for the
sub-units in the proposed hybrid i-motif. The first is that of
a PNA–PNA homoduplex and a DNA–DNA homoduplex
that could intercalate. The second is one where two PNA–
DNA heteroduplexes could intercalate. This could be
resolved by dissociating the hybrid complex by Nano ESI-
MS/MS. Because the net charge on the complex is zero,
it exhibited poor flying characteristics thereby limiting
detailed ESI-MS/MS studies. However, with a higher cone
voltage, it was possible to dissociate the tetrameric complex
into smaller fragments. This resulted in high intensity peaks
at m/z 1680 ± 0.02 (Figure 1E) where the isotopic separa-
tion indicated that the peaks were doubly charged, with an
associated molecular weight of 3360.9 ± 0.04 Da. This
corresponded to a p(C5T):d(TC5) heteroduplex with five
additional protons (calc. mol. wt. 3361.1 Da). Furthermore,
the complex did not show any other peaks corresponding
to DNA–DNA homoduplexes (in negative ion mode) or
PNA–PNA homoduplexes (in positive ion mode) despite
the net charge and good flight characteristics of these
homoduplexes (14). These results support a model where
the hybrid complex is composed of two identical sub-units,
namely the PNA–DNA heteroduplex. Taken together, our
Nano ESI-MS studies suggest that at pH 4.5, a 1:1 ratio of
p(C5T):d(TC5), forms a tetrameric complex that is held
together by 10 extra protons. Furthermore this complex is
composed of two PNA–DNA heteroduplexes each of which
is held together by five additional protons.
Hybrid complex shows a thermal transition
characteristic of C-H+C base pairs
Stability as a function of concentration: DNA duplexes and
triplexes show positively sloped sigmoidal curves when the
UV absorbance at 260 nm is monitored as a function of tem-
perature (T) whereas the melting transition of the i-motif,
which is held together by C.H+-C base pairs, is characterized
by a distinctive inverse sigmoidal melting curve at 295 nm
(32–35). UV melting studies were conducted on complexes
that were formed as mentioned in the Materials and Methods
section from an equimolar solution of d(TC5) and p(C5T)
at the desired strand concentration. UV melting profiles of

tion showed an inverse sigmoidal curve at 295 nm with an
associated T1/2 of 51.8 ± 0.2
C (Figure 3). This is about
6–7C higher than that of either the PNA4 or DNA4 i-motifs,
indicating that the hybrid is more stable than the parent
structures (14). This increased stability could be possibly
because the DNA4 i-motif is net negatively charged, the
PNA4 i-motif is net positively charged, but the hybrid is
electrically neutral. Interestingly, melting temperatures
of the hybrid complex at strand concentrations from 2–
200 mM showed negligible variation with concentration
(See Supplementary Table 1). A striking feature of the hybrid
complex was that the melting transitions were quite promin-
ent even at concentrations as low as 2 and 4 mM even though
neither d(TC5) nor p(C5T) showed well-behaved melting
transitions below 25 mM (see Supplementary Data). These
characteristics of the hybrid complex suggest that it is
much more efficiently associated with either of the parent
complexes at lower concentrations. Furthermore, the hybrid
showed a more cooperative melting transition than either of
the parent i-motifs.
Stability as a function of pH: The thermal denaturation of
i-motifs is strongly pH dependent as the formation of C-H.C+
base pairs require hemi-protonation of the cytosine nucleo-
bases. Melting studies on the hybrid, p(C5T) alone and its
DNA analog, d(TC5), were performed at different pH values
and the corresponding melting temperatures were plotted as a
function of pH (Figure 4A). At a strand concentration of
25 mM, T1/2 of the hybrid as a function of pH showed a
bell-shaped curve (Figure 4A) (31). In our hands d(TC5)
showed melting transitions only in the pH regime 4.2–6.8
whereas p(C5T) showed melting transitions over a much
narrower pH range (4.2–4.5) (14). The hybrid i-motif, on
the other hand, showed thermal transitions over an inter-
mediate pH regime of 4.2–5.7, probably reflecting the con-
tribution of DNA and PNA strands. Interestingly, the hybrid
complex showed maximum stability at pH 4.3–4.5 with an
associated T1/2 of 51.5 ± 0.2
C. Given that the pKa value of
N3 on cytidine mono phosphate is 4.4–4.5 (36), the maximum
number of C-C+ base pairs would be expected to form at a pH
equal to the pKa of N3 on cytosine. This strongly indicates
that the structure is held together by C-C+ base pairs, such
as those found in DNA i-motifs. Increasing or decreasing
the pH from the optimal pH value (4.3–4.5) had a marked
effect on the stability of the hybrid i-motif, which showed
abrupt lowering of T1/2 values and less cooperative melting
profiles (See Supplementary Data). For pH regimes outside
of 4.2–5.7 there was no detectable i-motif formation by the
hybrid.
CD spectroscopy of hybrid i-motif
In order to further characterize the hybrid i-motif we invest-
igated secondary structure formation of the complex by CD
spectroscopy. DNA4 i-motifs show a characteristic CD profile
with a positive maximum near 285 nm, which is followed by
a negative trough with a minimum centered near 265 nm (37).
A sample of 12.5 mM p(C5T) alone in acetate buffer (pH 4.5),
showed comparatively negligible CD as the only source of
chirality is the C-terminal lysine (Figure 4B). A 12.5 mM
solution of d(TC5) alone in 30 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5),
showed a characteristic, albeit modest, CD trace correspond-
ing to the small fraction of DNA4 i-motif formed at this
concentration. However, a 1:1 mixture of p(C5T):d(TC5) at
25 mM total strand concentration, showed a CD signal that
is amplified nearly 2-fold, Figure 4B, reaffirming the forma-
tion of a completely different species in line with gel electro-
phoresis and UV studies. The amplification of the signal
could be due to the greater degree of complexation of
DNA strands at 12.5 mM by PNA, or the imposition of the
chirality of the duplexed DNA backbone onto a larger
number of nucleobases. Since the basic features of the hybrid
CD profile preserved the CD characteristics of the DNA4
i-motif, it is likely that the nucleobases in the hybrid tetraplex
experience a similar chiral environment.
In order to confirm the fraction of hybrid complex formed,
complexes of d(TC5) at 10 mM incorporating incrementally
increasing p(C5T) concentrations were made in 30 mM
buffer, and CD at 288 nm of the resulting complexes were
plotted as a function of p(C5T) concentration. It was
observed that the CD value increased along with increase in
PNA concentration till a ratio of 1:1 PNA:DNA was reached.
The CD signal decreased thereafter, probably indicating that
excess PNA strands interfered with hybrid complex formation

due to the skewed strand ratios. Importantly, the maximum
signal is attained only when an equimolar amount of PNA
is added indicating that the DNA in the solution is completely
saturated, confirming that the hybrid is indeed predominant.
1D proton NMR and D2O exchange studies
In order to obtain more detailed structural information on the
hybrid complex we performed high resolution 1H NMR stud-
ies in 30 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 at 1 mM strand
concentration. The 1D NMR spectrum shows three distinct
peaks between 15–16 dp.p.m. [Figure 5A (i)] characteristic
of the imino protons in C-H+C base pairs in DNA4 i-motifs
(1,38,39). Also present was a single thymine imino peak at
11.4 dp.p.m. indicating a single population of hybrid (38).
The added presence of a single peak corresponding to the
thymine CH3 at 1.8 dp.p.m. further supports the formation
of a unique population that is C2-symmetric. Contributions
from single-stranded DNA and PNA were negligible indicat-
ing that these species are below the NMR detection limit.
This confirms the findings from CD experiments which indic-
ated that the hybrid was the predominant species in solution.
In order to gauge the extent of protection of various
H-bonded protons in the complex we carried out D2O
exchange experiments on the complex. The sample was lyo-
philized and resuspended in an equal volume of D2O and
NMR spectra were collected at different time points
(Figure 5A and B). Figure 5B shows the NMR spectrum
after 6 h of D2O exchange. Interestingly a set of signals cen-
tered on 8.5 dp.p.m. disappeared, which corresponds to the
non-hydrogen bonded amino protons (NH2e) and the PNA
amide backbone protons. Importantly, the N+HIm protons
exchanged more slowly (See Supplementary Data than the
backbone amide protons, suggesting that the former are pre-
sent in a more protected environment. This may be explained
by possible intercalation of PNA–DNA duplexes, as in DNA4
i-motifs, to form an inner core that is solvent shielded,
accounting for the slow exchange rate.
Homo-FRET reveals DNA–DNA and PNA–PNA
strand alignments
In order to elucidate strand polarity in this structure, hybrid
i-motifs were formed where only the PNA strands were
labeled with TMR. This was achieved by forming an
i-motif using a 1:1 mixture of d(TC5) and N-TMR-p(C5T).
In order to check that the incorporation of the fluorescent
label did not drastically alter the hybrid structure, thermal
melting of the complex was monitored by both UV and
fluorescence (Figure 5A and B insets). These showed that
the corresponding i-motifs were in fact marginally stabilized
compared to their unlabelled counterparts. The introduction
of the fluorescent label has been shown to alter i-motif stabil-
ities and has also been used to follow i-motif formation (40).
TMR self-quenches with an associated Fo¨rster’s distance of
44 A˚ (30). As shown in Figure 6A, the fluorescence of TMR
was quenched by 18% in the hybrid i-motif. This corres-
ponds to an interfluorophore distance of 52 ± 5 A˚, which is
consistent with a theoretical estimate (50 A˚, See Supplement-
ary Data) of head-to-tail (or antiparallel) arrangement of
both the PNA strands in the hybrid i-motif, taking into
account (i) lengths of the linkers connected the fluorophores
to strands and (ii) assuming complete intercalation of base
pairs. A similar homo-FRET study was performed to check
the DNA strand polarities in the hybrid i-motif using 1:1
30-TMR-d(TC5) : p(C5T). This gave an interfluorophore dis-
tance of 51.7 ± 5 A˚ revealing that the DNA strands are
also arranged in an antiparallel configuration in the hybrid
i-motif. A complementary study on the same distance at a
differently labeled site i.e. 50-TMR-d(TC5) gave an inter-
fluorophore distance of 53 ± 5 A˚ (see Supplementary Data)
that reaffirms DNA strand polarity in the hybrid i-motif.
Fluorescence quenching establishes relative strand
polarities in the hybrid i-motif
The two PNA–DNA duplexes can intercalate in two different
configurations that are C2-symmetric to form the hybrid
i-motif. Although, the hybrid need not have the same groove
dimensions as the DNA4 i-motif, as the chiral environment of
the latter is preserved in the former, we performed fluores-
cence quenching based distance measurements to ascertain
this issue. If one assumes that the groove dimensions of the
DNA4 i-motif are preserved in the hybrid, there are two pos-
sible configurations as shown in Figure 7. One, where each
narrow groove has one DNA and one PNA backbone each
(Model 1) and the other where one narrow groove has both
the DNA strands and the second has both the PNA strands
(Model 2). To address this, we formed an i-motif using
30 TMR-d(TC5) and N-Dabcyl-p(C5T). Theoretical estim-
ates of the interfluorophore distances, taking into account
linker lengths and assuming groove dimensions commen-
surate with DNA4 i-motifs, were found to be 9 A˚ in the
case of Model 1 and 20 A˚ in the case of Model 2. As
shown in Figure 8A, a quenching efficiency of 80% was
obtained, indicating a separation of 21.7 ± 5 A˚ consistent
with Model 2. Fluorescence quenching measurements on

these two distances.
NOESY shows sugar–sugar contacts between DNA
backbones of fully intercalated PNA–DNA duplexes
In order to address the validity of assumptions made in the
FRET and quenching experiments which were (i) complete
intercalation of the base pairs and that (ii) the groove dimen-
sions in the hybrid and the DNA4 i-motif could be compar-
able, NOESY experiments were recorded in H2O. NOESY
on the hybrid showed several cross peaks, a few of which
are indicated in Figure 9. Cross peaks were observed in the
NH2b–NHIm, NH2e–NHIm, NHIm–NHIm, H1
0–H10, H20–H200
regions as seen in analogous spectra of i-motifs (1). Intense
cross peaks between NH2e and sugar protons as well as
inter-sugar H10–H10 protons clearly indicate that the two
DNA strands are in close proximity and are present in a nar-
row groove with a separation comparable to DNA4 i-motifs
(1,41). This finding is in line with our fluorescence quenching
distance measurements. Figure 9 shows NOE’s corresponding
to the H10 region indicating several short sugar–sugar
H10–H10 contacts between the DNA backbones. The assign-
ments of NOE’s are consistent with the previously reported
DNA4 i-motif structure showing a base stacking order
of Thy-C6-C2-C5-C3-C4 revealing that the PNA–DNA
duplexes are indeed completely intercalated, reaffirming
the results from the fluorescence-based distance measure-
ments. Focused cross peaks between the glycine protons
(3.4–4 dp.p.m.) and the NH2e protons (8.2–9 dp.p.m.) signify
that the PNA strands are rigidified into a unique conformation
by virtue of it forming the hybrid i-motif (Supplementary
Data). Thus NOESY on the hybrid complex reveals that it
is indeed a structure formed by the complete intercalation
of C–C+ base paired PNA–DNA duplexes where the DNA
backbones are close enough to invoke sugar–sugar interac-
tions as seen in DNA4 i-motifs.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper describes the first four-stranded i-motif composed
of DNA and PNA. Nano-electrospray ionization mass spec-
troscopy revealed that a 1:1 mixture of PNA and DNA
strands with tandem C residues resulted in the formation of
a tetrameric species. Fragmentation studies revealed that the
tetramer was formed from two PNA–DNA heteroduplexes.
Temperature dependant UV studies on the complex revealed
a thermal transition characteristic of C–C+ base pairs.
Furthermore, the thermal stability of the hybrid complex as
a function of pH revealed that it exists over a pH regime
4.2–5.7 with maximum stability at pH 4.5, the pKa of cyto-
sine. This reaffirms that the hybrid complex was formed as
a consequence of hemi-protonated C–C+ base pairs as seen
in i-motifs. NMR spectroscopy revealed the existence of
a single population of a C2-symmetric complex and five
fully intercalated C–C+ base pairs. The central imino protons
exchanged slowly with D2O, reaffirming their existence in
a relatively solvent shielded environment, consistent with
hybrid i-motif formation. Homo-FRET experiments revealed

that in the hybrid i-motif, the PNA strands are antiparallel
with respect to each other, as are the DNA strands. This
is consistent with the CD data, which indicated that the
hybrid possessed similar topology to the DNA4 i-motif (37).
Fluorescence quenching studies revealed that the PNA–DNA
heteroduplexes were arranged, such that both DNA strands
occupied one narrow groove and the PNA strands occupied
the other groove. This was confirmed by NMR experiments
that showed sugar–sugar contacts in the form of NOEs
between the H10 protons of both the DNA backbones as in
DNA4 i-motifs.
Because of the altered affinities for duplex formation in the
hybrid i-motif, it can form at concentrations much lower than
the parent DNA4 or PNA4 i-motifs. The hybrid i-motif was
also more thermally stable than either of the parent DNA4
and parent PNA4 i-motifs. This is likely to be because two
of negatively charged backbones in the DNA4 i-motif are
replaced by neutral polyamide PNA backbones thereby redu-
cing the electrostatic repulsion associated with multi-stranded
structures. Furthermore, the DNA4 i-motif is net negatively
charged, the PNA4 i-motif is net positively charged and the
hybrid is an electrically neutral complex. The PNA4 i-motif
exists over a narrow pH regime, while the DNA4 i-motif
exists over a much wider pH window. The hybrid i-
motif, however, exists over a pH regime intermediate
between the parent DNA4 and PNA4 i-motifs. This is prob-
ably due to the lower number of DNA backbones that confers
on the complex a limited ability to tolerate pH change. CD
revealed that the hybrid has chiral characteristics similar to
that of the parent DNA4 i-motif. The hybrid i-motif is clearly
a robust structural element with attractive physico–chemical
properties that may be used as a nanoscale structural element.
We are currently exploiting the fast kinetics of hybrid i-motif
formation and abolition to develop nucleic acid-based
molecular switches in our laboratory.
Importantly, the hybrid i-motif presents a structural variant
of the DNA4 i-motif which helps assess relatively open-
ended issues regarding duplex intercalation and stability in
the DNA4 i-motif. Here, the intercalation of two DNA–
DNA duplexes gives rise to a remarkably narrow groove
positioning two negatively charged DNA backbones
extremely close resulting in greater electrostatic repulsion.
Thus, one of the prevailing issues regarding DNA i-motif
formation has been in understanding why the two DNA–
DNA duplexes should intercalate at all. It has been widely
suggested that the sugar–sugar contacts all along the back-
bones of the two strands located in the narrow grooves of
the i-motif favors tetramer formation (42,43) although evid-
ence for the contrary exists as well (14,15,25,44). The hybrid
i-motif is a model system that is well-placed to address this
issue, being a structural variant of the DNA4 i-motif, where
the DNA–DNA duplex is replaced by a PNA–DNA duplex,
which can intercalate in two different configurations, see
Models 1 and 2, Figure 7. In one, Model 1, electrostatic
repulsion may be minimized by positioning one DNA and
one PNA backbone in each of the narrow grooves. In the
other, Model 2, the sugar–sugar contacts may be maximized
by positioning both DNA backbones in one of the narrow
grooves. The strand arrangements in the hybrid i-motif is
exclusively one where both DNA strands occupy a single nar-
row groove, invoking sugar–sugar interactions, in spite of the
associated electrostatic repulsion. Thus the hybrid i-motif
offers a platform to evaluate the factors governing tetramer
formation in i-motifs by allowing the system to prioritize
electrostatic repulsion versus sugar–sugar contacts along the
DNA backbones. We observe that in the hybrid i-motif,
the stability gained from sugar–sugar contacts outweighs
the effects of electrostatic repulsion. In this regard, the struc-
ture of the hybrid i-motif suggests that sugar-sugar contacts in
i-motifs are not probably a consequence of, but possibly drive
i-motif tetramerization.
