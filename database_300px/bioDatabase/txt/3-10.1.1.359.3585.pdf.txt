ABSTRACT
Recent interest in non-coding RNA transcripts
has resulted in a rapid increase of deposited RNA
structures in the Protein Data Bank. However, a
characterization and functional classification of the
RNA structure and function space have only been
partially addressed. Here, we introduce the SARA
program for pair-wise alignment of RNA structures
as a web server for structure-based RNA function
assignment. The SARA server relies on the SARA
program, which aligns two RNA structures based
on a unit-vector root-mean-square approach. The
likely accuracy of the SARA alignments is assessed
by three different P-values estimating the statistical
significance of the sequence, secondary structure
and tertiary structure identity scores, respectively.
Our benchmarks, which relied on a set of 419 RNA
structures with known SCOR structural class, indi-
cate that at a negative logarithm of mean P-value
higher or equal than 2.5, SARA can assign the cor-
rect or a similar SCOR class to 81.4% and 95.3% of
the benchmark set, respectively. The SARA server is
freely accessible via the World Wide Web at http://
sgu.bioinfo.cipf.es/services/SARA/.
INTRODUCTION
It is now known that RNA molecules are essential for a
wide range of biological processes (1–6), which is changing
the view of RNA as a simple vector of genetic information
and reinforcing the hypothesis on the original ‘RNA
world’ (7,8). Biosynthesis and transcription regulation
(1–3,5), enzymatic action (5) and chromosome replication
(4) are some of the functions that RNA molecules are now
known to perform. RNA structure determination, which
is accelerating its pace of deposition in the Nucleic Acid
Database (NDB) (9) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
(10), is thus becoming an essential and necessary tool
for RNA function annotation. Although there are not
standard rules to infer function, at least for proteins
(11–13), structure similarity is arguably one of the most
reliable methods for comparative function annotation
(14,15).
Several methods have already been developed for the
alignment of two or more protein 3D structures (16).
However, only few are available for RNA structure com-
parison (17–23). The PRIMOS and AMIGOS programs
identify RNA structure motifs and compare RNA struc-
tures by describing them as a set of pseudo angles from the
C4’ and P atom trace (18,20). Both programs are limited
to the comparison of RNA structures with the same
number of nucleotides and only a newer version of
AMIGOS can perform a comparison of a given structure
against a set of RNA structures. The ARTS program was
introduced as a general method for RNA structure align-
ment (17,24). ARTS describes RNA molecules with a set
of ‘quadrats’ composed by four phosphate atoms of two
consecutive base-pairs and uses a bipartite graph to ﬁnd
the maximum number of aligned ‘quadrats’ between
two RNA structures. The DIAL program, developed to
compare RNA structures using a dynamic programming
algorithm (19), computes global, local and semi-global
alignments by taking into account sequence similarity,
dihedral angles and base-pair information from the two
aligned structures. DIAL can also return the Boltzmann
pair probabilities of the resulting alignments. However,
such computation would double the runtime, hence the
default in the DIAL server is not to calculate the pair
probabilities. More recently, the SARSA server was devel-
oped to align two or more RNA structures using a struc-
tural alphabet of 23 nucleotide conformations (22). Both,
the DIAL and SARSA servers were developed and bench-
marked for their ability detecting short RNA motifs in a
set of RNA structures. In contrast, the SARA program
(21), which implementation for function assignment of
RNA structures is here introduced, was recently devel-
oped to align two RNA structures based on a unit-
vector alignment strategy (25). Given its implementation,
an alignment by SARA shorter than 20 nt is likely to be
indistinguishable from random structure alignments.
The SARA program can be considered as an alternative

to existing alignment methods such as AMIGOS, ARTS,
DIAL, and SARSA.
Structure-based function assignment requires identify-
ing structural units and classifying them into annotated
functional groups. Currently, only the Structural
Classiﬁcation of RNA (SCOR) database (26) oﬀers such
a systematic classiﬁcation for RNA structures. SCOR was
designed to provide a comprehensive perspective and
understanding of RNA motif structure, function, tertiary
interactions and their relationships. Structure elements in
the SCOR database are organized in a directed acyclic
graph architecture, which allows multiple parent classes
for a given structure motif. Currently, SCOR stores the
structure and function classiﬁcation of 3D motifs con-
tained in 579 RNA structures. Unfortunately, the SCOR
database has not been updated since May 2004 and does
not include an option for automatically classifying new
RNA structures. Therefore, the SCOR database does
not reﬂect the rapid increase of deposited RNA structures
in the PDB. Only recently, the DART database (27),
which relies in the ARTS program for the alignment of
two RNA structures, proposed an automatically gener-
ated RNA structure classiﬁcation that resulted in 94 clus-
ters containing 1333 RNA structure motifs. In contrast to
SCOR, DARTS allows for automatic classiﬁcation of new
structures by providing a user-friendly Web interface.
However, the DARTS database does not include a func-
tion-based classiﬁcation similar to the SCOR database.
To overcome such limitations we introduce the implemen-
tation of our SARA program (21) for automatic function
assignment based on the SCOR classiﬁcation.
We begin by brieﬂy describing the benchmark sets
of RNA alignments for the development and evaluation
of the SARA program as well as outlining the algorithms
behind the SARA program (Method outline). Next, we
detail the requirements for using the SARA web server
(server details). Finally, we conclude by assessing the
impact of the SARA server on the automatic annotation
of the RNA structure space (Conclusions).
METHOD OUTLINE
RNA structure and alignment data sets
As of March 2009, the PDB stored a total of 1534 struc-
ture ﬁles containing at least one RNA chain. The initial
list of RNA structures was further ﬁltered by: (i) removing
any RNA structure with missing heavy atoms, (ii) remov-
ing any RNA structure with less than 20 nucleotides
and less than 3 base-pairs and (iii) removing redundancy
at 100% sequence identity. The ﬁltered data set, called
RNA09, included 451 RNA chains from 409 PDB entries.
Next, we run an all-against-all comparison of the entries in
the RNA09 data set using the ‘align’ program for global
sequence alignment without end gap penalty and with
default parameters (28). This run resulted in 50 995 pair-
wise alignments with sequence identity with respect to the
length of the alignment below 25%, which constituted our
BgALI data set. All pairs of structures in the BgALI data
set were then realigned with the SARA program to obtain
a background distribution of scores for pairs of unrelated
RNA structures.
To assess the accuracy of SARA in functional classiﬁca-
tion, the SCOR database (version 2.0.3, October 2004)
was used as a standard of truth. Although outdated, to
our knowledge SCOR is the only available function-based
classiﬁcation of RNA structures. Three more functional
data sets were collected from the SCOR database: (i) the
FSCOR data set, which includes RNA chains with more
than three base-pairs that are annotated with a unique
deepest SCOR functional class, (ii) the R-FSCOR data
set, which includes only representative structures clustered
at 90% structure identity for each class in the FSCOR
data set and (iii) the T-FSCOR data set, which includes
all structures in the FSCOR data set not present in the
R-SCOR data set. All data sets of RNA structures and
alignments are summarized in Table 1 and available for
download at http://sgu.bioinfo.cipf.es/datasets/.
SARA program for RNA structure alignment
The SARA program (21) is based on a unit-vector align-
ment strategy previously implemented for the alignment of
protein structures (25,29–31). Brieﬂy, the unit-vector rep-
resentation of an RNA, originally introduced as a tool to
analyze molecular dynamics trajectories (29) and fast
detection of common geometric substructure in proteins
(25), is calculated as follows: (i) given an RNA structure
with N nucleotides, for each i=1, . . . ,N–1 extract the
vector from the i-th to the (i+1)-th selected atoms;
(ii) normalize all obtained vectors to a unit-distance, and
place the tails of all normalized vectors at the origin of a
unit-sphere; the resulting collection of normalized vectors
is the unit-vector representation of the input RNA; (iii) the
Unit-vector RMS (URMS) distance between two input
RNA structures is the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) between their corresponding normalized vectors
after determining the rotation to minimize RMSD.
Speciﬁcally, SARA aligns two RNA structures by select-
ing its C30 or P atoms. If secondary structure information
is used, SARA selects only C30 or P atoms involved in the
base-pairing as computed by the 3DNA program (32) and
omits all other atoms. In such a case, RNA structures
are represented with a set of three unit-vectors for each
selected atoms forming a base-pair. The SARA program
calculates unit-spheres using four or eight successive
atoms, depending on the existence or not of base-paring
information, respectively. The SARA program cannot
compute an alignment between two structures with less

than nine selected atoms. The comparison of consecutive
unit-spheres generates an all-against-all similarity-scoring
matrix, which is used in a dynamic programming pro-
cedure for the global alignment of two RNA structures
using 0 end gap penalties (33). The output alignment is
then reﬁned by maximizing the number of equivalent
atoms or base-pairs within 3.5 A˚ RMSD using a vari-
ant of the MaxSub algorithm, which ensures that the
best local alignment is contained in the resulting
alignment (34).
To assess the likely accuracy of the alignments, the
SARA program calculates three diﬀerent raw scores: (i)
percentage of structural identity (PSI), which is the per-
centage of superimposed C30 nucleotide atoms within
4.0 A˚ with respect to the length (N) of the shorter of the
two structures; (ii) percentage of secondary structure iden-
tity (PSS), which is the percentage of aligned base-pairs as
deﬁned by 3DNA within 4.0 A˚ with respect to the lowest
number of base-pairs (NSS) in the two structures; and
(iii) percentage of sequence identity (PID), which is the
percentage of aligned nucleotides of the same type with
respect to the length (N) of the shorter of the two struc-
tures. Additionally, the SARA program calculates
P-values and their negative logarithms for the three iden-
tity scores, which estimate the probability of obtaining an
equal- or better-scored alignment by chance. The loga-
rithm of the P-value, which is independent of the raw
score distributions, allows the combination of the three
accuracy measures into a single score reported as the
mean of the three negative logarithms for PSI, PSS and
PID. The BgALI set of alignments was used to plot a
background distribution of PSI and PID with respect to
N and PSS with respect to NSS. Based on the analysis of
the scores resulting from random structure alignments
(35), such distributions were ﬁtted into an extreme value
distribution described by its mean (m) and standard devi-
ation (). Extreme value distributions has been previously
used to describe the statistics of background structure
alignments for both proteins (30) and RNA (21). The rela-
tionship between m and  and N or NSS can be extra-
polated by ﬁtting the points with high signiﬁcance to the
power law function Y=AXB, where Y is m or s relative
to PSI or PID and X is N (PSS and NSS when the align-
ment contains base-pairs, respectively). The values for the
A and B parameters and the correlation coeﬃcients of the
ﬁtting to an extreme value distribution are reported in
Table 2.
Structure-based function assignment
The SARA program can be used for structure-based func-
tion assignment by searching with a query structure
against a representative data set of annotated RNA struc-
tures. SARA predicts the function of the query structure
as the function of the top hit structure in the searched
database (i.e. with the alignment that results in the largest
mean of the three negative logarithms for PSI, PSS and
PID). Such hit corresponds to the highest probability of
correct assignment as measured by the ‘geodesic’ distance
(d), which is the number of edges linking two SCOR anno-
tations (36). Two RNA structures annotated in SCOR
with the same function will have a d=0 and two RNA
structures diﬀering at least in the deepest SCOR classiﬁ-
cation will have a d 2. To evaluate the accuracy of the
SARA program for function assignment, we have per-
formed two diﬀerent tests: (i) a leave-one-out benchmark
using the FSCOR data set and (ii) a benchmark annotat-
ing each of the structures in the T-FSCOR data set as
query against the R-FSCOR data set. The accuracy of
SARA for function assignment was evaluated by the frac-
tion of corrected annotated SCOR functions (QCF) and
the fraction of equal or similar assigned SCOR functions
(QSF), which corresponds to d=0 and d 2, respectively.
The SARA program correctly assigns the exact or similar
function to 81.4% and 95.3% of the FSCOR data set
at the mean –log(P-value) cut-oﬀ of 2.5, respectively
(Figure 1A). At this cut-oﬀ, 58.7% of the structures in
the FSCOR data set were annotated by the SARA pro-
gram (Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained for the
benchmark using each of the structures in the T-FSCOR
data set as query against the R-FSCOR data set. The
accuracy of the SARA program was 78.0% and 94.5%
for QCF and QSF, respectively, with 56.0% of data set
coverage (Figure 1B). These results indicate that the accu-
racy of the SARA program for assigning the exact func-
tion decreases with the use of a representative set of the
SCOR functions (i.e. the R-FSCOR data set), which has
less structural diversity within each of the functional
groups. However, the SARA program maintains the
accuracy for assigning similar functions to those structures
(i.e. d 2).
We have also evaluated the SARA program accuracy
by calculating the area under its receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) (37). A ROC curve is
obtained by plotting the false-positive rate against the
corresponding true-positive rate for all possible cut-oﬀs
on the mean of the negative logarithm of P-values. The
AUC, a threshold independent measure, is considered a
robust indicator of a classiﬁer quality given its indepen-
dence from the selected threshold and its correlation with
the probability of the classiﬁer error (37). Thus, an AUC
of one indicates a perfect classiﬁer and an AUC of
zero corresponds to a totally erroneous classiﬁcation.
The SARA program tested with the FSCOR benchmark
data set resulted in an AUC of 0.61 and 0.83 for d=0 and
d 2, respectively. The prediction accuracy is maintained
for the T-FSCOR benchmark set resulting in AUC values
of 0.58 and 0.85 for d=0 and d 2, respectively.

SERVER DETAILS
Pair-wise structure alignment
The SARA server for structure alignment requires the
input of either two PDB/NDB codes or two coordinates
ﬁles in PDB format (Figure 2A). Alternatively, the user
can manually modify the default options of the SARA
program by unchecking the ‘default options’ check box.
Optional parameters include the open and extension gap
penalties to be used during dynamic programming, the
number of consecutive atoms to use in the unit-vector
representation, the use of secondary structure information
calculated by the 3DNA program, and the type of atom
selected for calculating the unit vectors. When the second-
ary structure information option is selected, but the
3DNA program cannot calculate any base-pairs, SARA
will use the single atom unit-vector alignment method.
Moreover, the SARA server also aligns two RNA struc-
tures in the case when one of the two PDB contains only a

phosphate-trace by automatically selecting the appropri-
ate atom type. For pairs of structures under 1000 nucleo-
tides of length, the results are normally reported within
few seconds. The user is provided with a single output
page that is divided in three sections containing: (i) the
superposed coordinates of the two RNA input structures
visualized using the Jmol applet (http://www.jmol.org)
and as three downloadable ﬁles in the PDB, PIR and
easy-to-read ALI formats, (ii) an easy-to-read sequence
alignment that corresponds to the superposed structures,
and (iii) all numerical results calculated from the super-
position. Additionally, all the data shown in the output
page is reported within the superposed coordinate ﬁle
using the ‘REMARK’ ﬁeld of the PDB format.
Structure-based function assignment
The SARA server for function assignment requires the
input of one PDB/NDB code or a coordinates ﬁle in
PDB format (Figure 2B). Similar to the structure align-
ment interface of the SARA server, the user may select to
change the default parameters including the possibility of
selecting to do the structure search against RNA struc-
tures larger than 1000 nucleotides (i.e. including ribosomal
RNA molecules). This last option requires more computa-
tional time, thus delaying the return of the results. By
default, the SARA server will not include large structures
and the search will be performed against a set of 162 RNA
representative structures from the SCOR database (i.e.
RNA structures shorter than 1000 nucleotides from the
R-FSCOR data set). If the default option is changed,
then the search is conducted over the whole set of 192
RNA representative structures, obtained by clustering at
the 90% structure identity cut-oﬀ, all the structures within
each of the SCOR functional class (i.e. the R-FSCOR data
set). The search results are returned within few minutes
for query structures of about 100 nucleotides. The out-
put contains a sorted list of hits with details of each of
the individual alignments such as: the alignment rank, the
PDB code of the chain in the representative set, the length
of the shorter of the two aligned structures, the lowest
number of base-pairs between the two aligned structures,
the percentage of sequence, secondary structure and ter-
tiary structure identities (PID, PSS, PSI), the negative
logarithms of the P-values relative to the three identity
scores, their mean value and the probability of correct
(d=0) and similar (d 2) SCOR function assignments.
The output list is sorted by the mean of the negative log-
arithm of the three P-values. All computed alignments and
the PDB ﬁles containing the coordinates of the superim-
posed pairs of structures are stored for download in the
SARA server for about 24 h. Finally, the SCOR func-
tional classiﬁcation of the representative RNA structures
is reported in the output and reachable via a URL to the
SCOR database.
Computational limitations
Due to its algorithmic implementation, the SARA pro-
gram cannot align RNA structures shorter than 9 nt,
which corresponds to the minimal number of atoms
needed to calculate at least two sets of seven unit-vectors.
Moreover, because the high computational requirements
for aligning two very large RNA structures, the SARA
server for both structure alignment and function assign-
ment is currently limited to input RNA structures of less
than 1000 nucleotide length, which covers 92% of all
available RNA structures deposited in the PDB.
CONCLUSIONS
The SARA server, which relies in the SARA program
for structure alignment, can perform two diﬀerent tasks:
(i) structure alignment of two input structures, which usu-
ally is returned within seconds of computational time
(e.g. 10 s for input RNA structures of 100 nt) and (ii)
function assignment of new RNA structures, which is
returned usually within few minutes after submission
(e.g. 5min for input RNA structures of 100 nucleo-
tides). The SARA server provides an alternative structure
alignment method to ARTS (17), DIAL (19) and SARSA
(22) as well as an alternative for function assignment to
the DARTS database (27). The SARA program has a
more general application with respect to previous struc-
ture alignment and function assignment methods, allow-
ing the calculation of RNA structure alignment even when
only the phosphate-trace is known and no secondary
structure is available. In addition, it quickly reports a sta-
tistical signiﬁcance of the alignment that can be used for
assessing its relevance. To our knowledge, the SARA
server represents the ﬁrst method available on the Web
for automatic classiﬁcation of new RNA structures
within the SCOR database. In the future, the SARA pro-
gram could be used for studying the RNA structure and
function space and deﬁning a catalogue of RNA struc-
tures, which should help in characterizing how RNA
molecules function.
AVAILABILITY AND REQUIREMENTS
SARA is freely available on the Internet at http://sgu.
bioinfo.cipf.es/services/SARA/ and requires a Web brow-
ser that is capable of running the JMol applet. The web
interface is programmed in PHP and the SARA method is
programmed in Python. The SARA standalone program
is available upon request.
