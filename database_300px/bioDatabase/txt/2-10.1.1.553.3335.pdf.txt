ABSTRACT
Sequence-selective recognition of double-stranded
(ds) DNA by homopyrimidine peptide nucleic acid
(PNA) oligomers can occur by major groove
triplex binding or by helix invasion via triplex
P-loop formation. We have compared the binding
of a decamer, a dodecamer and a pentadecamer
thymine–cytosine homopyrimidine PNA oligomer to
a sequence complementary homopurine target in
duplex DNA using gel-shift and chemical probing
analyses. We find that all three PNAs form stable
triplex invasion complexes, and also conventional
triplexes with the dsDNA target. Triplexes form with
much faster kinetics than invasion complexes and
prevail at lower PNA concentrations and at shorter
incubation times. Furthermore, increasing the ionic
strength strongly favour triplex formation over
invasion as the latter is severely inhibited by
cations. Whereas a single triplex invasion complex
is formed with the decameric PNA, two structurally
different target-specific invasion complexes were
characterized for the dodecameric PNA and more
than five for the pentadecameric PNA. Finally, it
is shown that isolated triplex complexes can be
converted to specific invasion complexes without
dissociation of the Hoogsteen base-paired triplex
PNA. These results demonstrate a clear example of
a ‘triplex first’ mechanism for PNA helix invasion.
INTRODUCTION
Efficient and specific targeting of predefined chromosomal
DNA sequences by synthetic ligands is a major goal in
chemical biology. A variety of agents are available for this
purpose including engineered zinc finger proteins (1),
synthetic polyamides (2) triplex forming oligonucleotides
(TFOs) (3,4) and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) (5,6). PNA
oligomers are synthetic DNA mimics containing a pseu-
dopeptide backbone consisting of an N-aminoethyl glycine
polymer to which the nucleobases are connected via methy-
lene carbonyl linkers (7). PNA binds sequence complemen-
tary single-stranded nucleic acid targets with high affinity
and selectivity (8). Particularly stable ‘P-loop’ triplex inva-
sion structures can form upon binding of homopyrimidine
PNAs to double-stranded (ds) DNA containing a sequence
complementary purine target via formation of an internal
PNA–DNA–PNA triplex involving combined Watson–Crick
and Hoogsteen base pairing (9). In this four-stranded
structure, the unbound DNA strand is displaced in a single-
stranded conformation. A number of variant P-loop com-
plexes have been described, the formation of which depends
on the PNA oligomer and DNA sequence in question (5,6).
P-loop complexes have been used in a number of applica-
tions for instance for interference with (10–15), or activation
of (15–17) transcription.
Because two PNA strands are involved in the triplex
invasion P-loop complex, bis-PNA constructs containing
two PNA oligomers connected via a flexible linker were
generated (18). Bis-PNAs generally bind complementary
DNA targets with superior efficiency as compared with
conventional ‘mono’-PNAs (19,20) because of the pseudo-
first-order reaction of binding for bis-PNAs as compared
with the pseudo-second order of binding for mono-PNAs.
Furthermore, the strand polarity can be optimized for
bis-PNAs to allow the preferred parallel (i.e. the PNA
N-terminus facing the 50 end of the bound DNA strand) and
anti-parallel (i.e. the PNA N-terminus facing the 30 end of the
bound DNA strand) orientation of the PNA strand bound via
Hoogsteen and Watson–Crick base pairs, respectively. The
binding can be further enhanced at physiological pH by the
substitution of pseudoisocytosine for cytosine (pseudoisocy-
tosine does not require low pH for efficient Hoogsteen base
pairing to guanine) (18). Using a mono-PNA the two strands
of the P-loop are identical and consequently the polarity of
one or the other must be suboptimal unless a symmetrical
sequence is targeted. Bis-PNA binding to a cognate target
can yield structural isomers of perfectly matched P-loops.
Such isomers are the consequence of alternative trajectories

of the bis-PNA linker relative to the DNA strands in kineti-
cally trapped complexes (21).
Because the dissociation rate of triplex invasion complexes
is exceedingly slow (19,22) (and often not directly measur-
able at physiological temperature), helix invasion using
decamer homopyrimidine PNA oligomers is kinetically
controlled (23). Consequently, single mismatch specificity
is also kinetically controlled, i.e. depending on the on-rate
only (24). Typically, the association rate for fully matched
complexes is significantly higher than that for mismatched
complexes. However, once formed, even mismatched com-
plexes remain highly stable so prolonged incubation times
or increased PNA concentrations will eventually result in
the formation of mismatched complexes (23).
Different mechanisms have been proposed for P-loop
formation (23,25,26). Current evidence favour a ‘Hoogsteen
first’ mechanism in which one PNA strand initially binds as
a non-invasion triplex in the major groove via Hoogsteen
base pairs followed by binding of another PNA strand via
helix invasion and Watson–Crick base pairing. The evidence
for this mechanism is indirect, however, and the molecular
details remain poorly understood.
Clearly, kinetic control is of paramount importance in
helix invasion of dsDNA by PNA. Moreover, the extent to
which kinetics and thermodynamics each contribute to the
control of PNA–dsDNA recognition is most likely shifted
further towards kinetics for PNA oligomers of increased
length. This is particularly pertinent for targeting unique
sequences in the human genome, which from statistical
considerations would require recognition of 15–17 bp. We
therefore asked what might be the structural consequences
of using such extended PNA oligomers for P-loop formation.
To avoid the structural and kinetic complications associated
with bis-PNAs (see above), we used conventional mono-
PNAs. We analysed PNA–dsDNA complexes resulting from
incubation of 10mer, 12mer and 15mer homopyrimidine
PNAs with dsDNA containing a cognate sequence target.
The results show that increased PNA oligomer length causes
increased complexity of the generated sequence-targeted
complexes. Furthermore, the data reveal the existence
of distinct pathways for helix invasion by homopyrimi-
dine PNA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PNA oligomers
PNA oligomers were synthesized as described (18,27).
Conjugation of the nitrilotetraacetic acid (NTA) group to
the N-terminus PNA was previously described (28). The
following PNAs were used: PNA1707 (H-TTTTTCTCTC-
Lys-NH2) (measured mass: 2761; calculated mass: 2763),
PNA1708 (H-TTTTTCTCTCTC-Lys-NH2) (measured mass:
3276; calculated mass: 3280), PNA2046 (NTA-Lys-TTTT-
TCTCTCTC-Lys-NH2) (measured mass: 3584; calculated
mass: 3583), PNA1940 (NTA-Lys2-TTTTTCTCTCTCTCT-
Lys-NH2) (measured mass: 4492; calculated mass: 4495).
PNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry
at 260 nm using the following molar extinction coefficients:
eT (8800 M1 cm1) and eC (7300 M1 cm1). Low binding
tubes (Sorenson Biosciences Cat. no. 11720 or Eppendorf
Cat. no. 22 43 108-1) and tips (Sorenson Biosciences Cat.
no.: 35010 and 35090) were used.
DNA
All DNA manipulations were done using standard methods
(29). The p322 vector is a pUC19 derivative containing
the PNA target sequence 50-AAAAAGAGAGAGAGA-30/
50-TCTCTCTCTCTTTTT-30) in the polylinker region. The
PNA target is flanked on one side by a unique engineered
XbaI site and on the other side by an EcoRI restriction site
from the vector (see Supplementary Material). The plasmid
was propagated in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue
(Stratagene), amplified by maxipreparation (Jet Star,
Genomed) and verified by sequencing at DNA Technology,
Denmark.
The relevant DNA restriction fragment of p322 was
50-labelled using polynucleotide kinase and [g-32P]ATP or
30-labelled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase
and [a-32P]dATP at the desired end as indicated in the
figure legends using standard methods (29). The DNA frag-
ments were resolved using 5% polyacrylamide gels (30:1
in acrylamide to bisacrylamide), and the relevant fragment
was excised and eluted overnight into 0.5 M ammonium
acetate, 1 mM EDTA. Recovered 32P-DNA was precipitated
with 96% ethanol, washed with 70% ice-cold ethanol and
air dried. The DNA was resuspended in H2O and stored
at 20C.
Analyses of PNA binding to a target in dsDNA
by gel-shift and chemical probing
32P-DNA fragment (10–20 nM) was incubated with the
indicated amount of PNA for 1 h in 20 ml of 10 mM sodium
phosphate at pH 6 or 6.5 as indicated (slightly acidic
due to the requirement of Hoogsteen base pairing on
protonization of cytosine position N3) at 37C. Resulting
complexes were resolved by electrophoretic gel-shift analysis
using native TAE-buffered 10% PAGE and visualized by
autoradiography.
For in situ chemical probing with DMS and KMnO4,
varying PNA concentrations (0.25–10 mM) were used to
establish the desired PNA–dsDNA complexes. Individual
PNA–dsDNA complexes were excised from native polyacry-
lamide gels and processed basically as described (5,21) using
optimized in situ probing reaction times of 1 min (DMS) or
2 min (KMnO4).
Fe/NTA affinity cleavage was done in 100 ml sodium
phosphate buffer. Eight ml of 10 mM (NH4)2[Fe(SO4)2] was
added and incubation continued for 5 min at 37C followed
by addition of 20 ml 50 mM DTT, and incubation for 1 h at
37C. The reactions were terminated by addition of 10 ml of
0.5 M EDTA at pH 8. Adenine/guanine-specific sequence
reactions were performed as described (5).
Kinetic analyses were conducted by setting up a master
mix (V ¼ 220 ml) containing PNA1940 at a final concentra-
tion of 5 mM and 32P-labelled target DNA fragment in
10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5). At the indicated length
of time, 20 ml sample was withdrawn, combined with
TAE loading buffer and immediately resolved by 10%
TAE-buffered PAGE. The data were quantified using a phos-
phorimager and Image Quant software. When appropriate,

the ‘quench’ oligonucleotide 50-dAGAGAGAGAGAAAAA-

PNA1940.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Gel-shift analysis of PNA–dsDNA complexes
The PNA decamer gave rise to a single gel-shift [Designated
PD10—the designation ‘PD’ identifies a complex as consist-
ing of PNA and dsDNA. To keep track of gel-shifted
complexes a suffix is added that includes a roman number
identifying the gel-shift complex in question and a superscript
identifying the PNA oligomer length used. The nomenclature
should not be confused with the ‘PD-loop’ (30).] upon
binding to a dsDNA fragment harbouring one sequence
complementary target (Figure 1A). In contrast, incubation
of the PNA dodecamer or the PNA pentadecamer with the
dsDNA fragment harbouring the sequence complementary
target resulted in multiple retarded gel migration species
designated PDI12–PDIII12 and PDI15–PDVII15, respectively
(Figures 2A and 3A).
Decamer PNA–dsDNA complexes
P-loop structures can be probed using potassium perman-
ganate (KMnO4) and dimethyl sulphate (DMS) (9). KMnO4
preferentially oxidizes the 5–6 double bond of unstacked
(single-stranded) thymine nucleobases, which poises the
DNA strand for alkali-induced backbone cleavage at such
reacted sites (31). Hypersensitivity towards KMnO4 can
thus be used to reveal the single-stranded DNA of a P-loop
(9). DMS methylates guanine at the N7 position (and to a
much lesser extent adenine at the N3 position) (32). Because
the guanine N7 is engaged in Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding,
PNA interference with DMS methylation can be used to
reveal Hoogsteen base pairing, e.g. during P-loop formation.
Chemical probing of the gel-excised PD10 complex
revealed protection from DMS methylation of residues G6,
G8 and G10 (Figure 1B) and hypersensitivity towards
KMnO4 oxidation of T1–T5, T7 and T9 (Figure 1C). These
results are compatible with a triplex invasion complex
containing two PNA strands bound via combined Watson–
Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs. Because the DNA lacks
G-residues as a reporter for DMS probing in the 50-target
region, we cannot formally rule out alternative modes of

binding for the Hoogsteen base-paired PNA strand. However,
we favour the parallel alignment shown in Figure 1E because
this is the optimal binding orientation (18) and because
incomplete base pairing would involve as few as 5 bp of
PNA–DNA hybrid that would be very unstable (33).
When the PNA binding reaction was carried out at elevated
ionic strength conditions no hybridization of conventional
unmodified decamer homopyrimidine PNA was detected in
gel-shift analyses. In contrast, probing directly in solution
revealed a PNA concentration-dependent protection from
DMS methylation in reactions supplemented with 90 mM
KCl (Figure 1D). These results [consistent with the previous
results (11,24,34–36)], show that invasion by simple PNA
oligomers is severely compromised at elevated ionic strength
and suggests that a conventional triplex structure involving
PNA decamer bound via Hoogsteen base pairs is formed,
which is not sufficiently stable for gel-shift analysis
(Figure 1F).
Dodecamer PNA–dsDNA complexes
Three complexes designated PDI12, PDII12 and PDIII12 were
identified by gel-shift analysis upon incubation of the PNA
dodecamer with the dsDNA fragment containing the cognate
sequence target (Figure 2A). The relative ratio of these com-
plexes was PNA concentration dependent. PDI12 was the pre-
dominant species at low PNA concentrations and the amount
of this complex decreased with increasing PNA concentra-
tion. In contrast, the amount of PDII12 and PDIII12 increased
with increasing PNA concentration and these complexes were
the sole species observed at elevated PNA concentrations.
We anticipated that ionic strength would affect triplex
formation much less than helix invasion. Thus to distinguish
possible triplex and invasion type complexes, a salt titration
was conducted. At the employed PNA concentration, low
ionic strength conditions produced only PDII12 and PDIII12,
but as the salt concentration was increased, PDI12 emerged
at the expense of the former (Figure 2B) suggesting that
PDII12 and PDIII12 are invasion complexes whereas PDI12
is a conventional triplex.
To enable an investigation of the PNA strand polarity of
gel-shifted complexes, we chose to employ NTA-conjugated
PNA oligomers (see below). Using such conjugated
dodecamer PNA (PNA2046), gel-shifts PDI12, PDII12 and
PDIII12 were obtained analogously to those obtained with
unmodified PNA dodecamer (Supplementary Figure S1).
Chemical probing of gel-excised PDI12 involving NTA-
conjugated PNA dodecamer, showed that guanine residues
G6 through G12 are protected from DMS methylation
(Figure 2C, lane 3), and all thymine residues T1 through
T11 are resistant to KMnO4 oxidation (Figure 2D, lane 3).
These results show PNA binding to residues G6–G12 compati-
ble with a structure containing a single PNA oligomer bound
via Hoogsteen base pairs to target residues A1–G12 (since
there are no G-residues in the 50-proximal target, DMS
probing cannot be used to reveal PNA binding to this region)
(Figure 2F, PDI12).
To investigate the orientation of PNA strands in the gener-
ated PD complexes, we employed Fe/NTA affinity cleavage.
Ferrous ions are well-known DNA cleaving reagents that
function via activation by molecular oxygen. Such reactions
are particularly useful in conjunction with a bifunctional
molecule containing a DNA-binder linked to a metal chelator
because this yields DNA cleavage proximal to the DNA
binder (37,38). Lohse et al. (28) previously reported the
synthesis and properties of such a bifunctional molecule
based on a NTA–PNA conjugate in which ferrous iron was
chelated to the NTA group.
PDI12 subjected to Fe/NTA affinity cleavage showed
strand scission 50-distal to the PNA target (Figure 2E, lane 3).
Because the NTA moiety is conjugated via the N-terminus of
the PNA (see Materials and Methods), these data are
compatible with a parallel orientation of the PNA oligomer
and formally establish the binding of the PNA strand to the
entire target (residues A1–G12) (Figure 2F, PDI
12 ).
DMS probing of gel-excised PDII12 and PDIII12 revealed
protection from methylation of guanine residues G6 through
G12 (Figure 2C, lanes 4 and 5) similar to that of PDI
12.
Thus both PDII12 and PDIII12 contain a PNA strand bound
via Hoogsteen base pairs to the target (see below).
Permanganate probing of gel-excised PDIII12 revealed
hypersensitive thymine residues along the entire target region
including T1–T11 (Figure 2D, lane 5). Consequently, the
PDIII12 complex must constitute a helix invasion type
structure in which a Watson–Crick base-paired PNA strand
is hybridized to all target residues A1–G12 in a parallel
orientation (Figure 2F, PDIII12). Permanganate probing of
gel-excised PDII12 revealed an unequal hypersensitivity of
the thymines within the target: T1 through T3 were almost
entirely resistant to KMnO4 oxidation, T4 and T5 showed
intermediate KMnO4 hypersensitivity, and finally T7, T9
and T11 were most hypersensitive (Figure 2D, lane 4). Thus
PDII12 represent an invasion type structure, with only partial
target occupation, in which the helix invasion PNA is bound
to DNA target residues G6–G12. Such partial Watson–Crick
base pairing can occur with the optimal anti-parallel strand
orientation (Figure 2F, PDII12).
Induction of Fe/NTA affinity cleavage in PDII12 and
PDIII12 revealed DNA strand scission 50 to the PNA target
in both cases (Figure 2E, lanes 4 and 5). In PDII12, the
50-cleavage is accounted for by a parallel PNA bound via
Hoogsteen base pairs. The PNA strand engaged in Watson–
Crick base pairing, is not expected to yield efficient
30-dsDNA strand scission if the Fe/NTA group is displaced
from the target via a segment of unbound PNA (Figure 2F).
Finally, in the case of PDIII12, selective Fe/NTA affinity
cleavage at the 50-dsDNA target is accounted for by a parallel
orientation of both Hoogsteen and Watson–Crick base-paired
PNA strands, which co-locates the reactive Fe/NTA groups
to this position.
Thus, PDII12 and PDIII12 are structurally different. The
PDII12 complex exhibit optimal strand polarity at the expense
of a reduced number of base pairs (only 7 out of 12 possible
invasion base pairs), whereas PDIII12 complex has compro-
mised strand polarity (parallel Watson–Crick base-paired
PNA strand) but an optimal number of base pairs (12 invasion
base pairs).
Pentadecamer PNA–dsDNA complexes

going from PNA decamer to PNA dodecamer, the number

of PNA–dsDNA complexes increased even further when
using the PNA pentadecamer now counting at least 7
complexes: PDI15–PDVII15 (Figure 3). In analogy to the
results for the PNA dodecamer, the distribution among
the pentadecamer PNA–dsDNA complexes is highly PNA
concentration dependent (Figure 3A) and sensitive to ionic
strength (Figure 3B): PDI15–PDII15 and PDIII15–PDVII15
are prominent at low and high PNA concentrations, respec-
tively. On increasing the ionic strength, PDI15 and PDII15
appear at the expense of PDIII15–PDVII15. This suggests
that PDI15 and PDII15 represent triplex type structures
whereas PDIII15 through PDVII15 most likely correspond to
various distinct invasion complexes.
DMS probing of gel-excised complexes PDI15 and PDII15
showed protection of all target guanines (G6 through G14;
Figure 3C, lanes 3 and 4) and KMnO4 probing revealed
resistance to oxidation of all target thymines (T1–T15;
Figure 3D, lanes 3 and 4) consistent with these complexes
being triplex type structures containing a single PNA strand
bound via Hoogsteen base pairs to the DNA target. These
data could be compatible with the existence of two triplexes,
one with the PNA bound parallel to the entire target
(A1–A15), and another with the PNA bound anti-parallel to
only part of the target (A5–A15). However, Fe/NTA affinity
cleavage unambiguously establishes that the PNA strand
bound via Hoogsteen base pairs is hybridized to the DNA tar-
get in a parallel orientation for both complexes (Figure 3C,
lanes 2 and 3).
Enigmatically, complexes PDI15 and PDII15 are clearly
different structures as based on their electrophoretic mobility
differences in native gels (Figure 3A and B)—yet they are
indistinguishable via chemical probing, at least using the
present methods. This result could, in principle, be caused
by an inhomogeneous PNA oligomer preparation containing
truncated or modified PNA molecules. However, although
small amounts of impurities were seen by HPLC, mass
spectrometry revealed only a single peak of the correct
mass arguing against this (data not shown). Furthermore,
since PDI15 and PDII15 show similar affinity cleavage inten-
sities (Figure 3E), both complexes must contain full-lenth
PNA oligomers because the NTA group is conjugated to
the PNA oligomer in the last coupling step.
Chemical probing of gel-excised PDVI15 (i.e. in fact two
poorly resolved complexes) and PDVII15 revealed that both
complexes show protection towards DMS methylation of
all DNA target guanines (G6 through G14; Figure 3C, lanes
7 and 8). Thus both complexes contain a PNA strand bound
via Hoogsteen base pairs to at least part of the target, but
most likely to the entire target (A1 through A15). Although
the Fe/NTA affinity cleavage yielded inconclusive data for
invasion complexes involving PNA pentadecamer due to
interference with gel-mobility by the exceedingly stable
PNA2–DNA triplex (data not shown), we favour a structure
in which the Hoogsteen base-paired PNA strand binds
parallel to the target DNA strand because this is observed
in the case of all PD12 complexes as well as for PDI15 and
PDII15, and is the preferred orientation for PNA Hoogsteen
hybridization (18).
As in the case of PDII12 and PDIII12, probing of gel-
excised PDVI15 and PDVII15 revealed notable differences
in hypersensitivity to permanganate oxidation of target
thymines (Figure 3D). In the case of PDVI15, target residues
T1 through T4 showed minimal reactivity, T5 exhibit interme-
diate hypersensitivity, and T7–T15 were all strongly reactive
towards permanganate. These results are consistent with
partial invasion by a PNA strand bound via Watson–Crick
base pairs to target residues A7 through A15, most likely in
an anti-parallel orientation. Permanganate probing of the
PDVII15 complex revealed strong and almost equal hypersen-
sitivity along the entire DNA target compatible with invasion
of the target by a PNA strand bound to the entire target
(A1 through A15) in a parallel orientation.
Thus PDVI15 and PDVII15 are distinct structures. Most
likely, both complexes have a fully hybridized parallel Hoog-
steen base-paired PNA strand (i.e. bound to residues A1–A15).
PDVI15 has a reduced number of Watson–Crick base pairs
(9 out of 15 bp), presumably reflecting an optimal binding
orientation of the invasion PNA strand. In contrast, PDVII15
has an optimal number of Watson–Crick base-pairs, which
can only take place with suboptimal PNA strand polarity.
In other words, PDVII15 appears to be a conventional
P-loop structure with a 15 bp internal PNA–DNA–PNA
triple helix and a corresponding stretch of displaced DNA,
whereas PDVI15, due to an internal duplex–triplex hybrid
shows only 9–10 bp of looped out DNA (Figure 3F).
The least prominent complexes PDIII15 through PDV15
remain incompletely understood in part because PDIV15
and PDV15 could not be separated. Consequently, specific
structural assignments have been omitted for these complexes
and the probing data are merely summarized (Figure 3F,
PDIII15 or PDIV15/PDV15). Probing of gel-excised PDIII15
or the PDIV15/PDV15 mixture showed that these different
complexes have in common that all target guanine residues
except G14 (the 3
0-ultimate guanine) show protection
towards DMS methylation indicating that a PNA strand
binds incompletely to the target sequence via Hoogsteen
base pairs (Figure 3C, lanes 5 and 6). Further chemical
probing of PDIII15 and PDIV15/PDV15 revealed maximal
permanganate hypersensitivity in the middle of the target
(T7 through T12). Towards the 3
0 end of the target of both
PDIII15 and PDIV15/PDV15 showed reduced hypersensitivity
towards KMnO4 at position T15. Towards the 5
0 end of the
target, PDIII15 and PDIV15/PDV15 differed with respect to
permanganate reactivity. PDIII15 showed only marginal
reactivity at residues T1 through T4 and intermediate hyper-
sensitivity at position T5. The PDIV
15/PDV15, however,
showed minimal permanganate reactivity at position T1 and
T2 and intermediate hypersensitivity at positions T3–T5.
Thus PDIII15 and PDIV15/PDV15 are clearly distinct struc-
tures with respect to the helix invasion PNA strand. Together
these results show that stable invasion complexes involv-
ing structures with incompletely bound Hoogsteen and/or
Watson–Crick base-paired PNA strands can result upon
binding of a PNA pentadecamer to a cognate dsDNA target.
Conversion of triplex to invasion complex
Previous studies have addressed the mechanism of PNA helix
invasion of a dsDNA target suggesting the triplex as an
intermediate (23,25,26). The present results reveal distinct
and stable triplex structures (Figures 2 and 3), and therefore
it should be possible to study their possible interconversion

and conversion into invasion complexes by incubation of
isolated triplex with additional PNA oligomer. Hence
gel-purified PDI15 and PDII15 triplexes were challenged
with additional PNA pentadecamer (Figure 4). Indeed,
PDI15 and PDII15 were transformed into various new species.
Surprisingly, each specific triplex yielded unique invasion
complexes: PDI15 produced PDIII15 and PDV15 while
PDII15 gave rise to PDIV15, PDVI15 and PDVII15
(Figure 4). Furthermore, the two triplexes PDI15 and PDII15
were not interconvertible. These results provide compelling
evidence that a triplex is indeed a substrate for invasion
and also supports that the triplexes PDI15 and PDII15 are
structurally different. Irrespective of the nature of this differ-
ence and of its cause, each triplex produces a distinct
family of invasion complexes indicating that binding of the
‘Watson–Crick’ PNA strand occurs via the pre-existing
‘Hoogsteen type’ triplex—and does not require or promote
its dissociation. We also note that base pair alterations appar-
ently take place in the Hoogsteen base-paired-PNA strand
upon transformation from PDI15 to PDIII15 (Figure 3C, cf.
lanes 3 and 5) (see below).
Kinetics
Further investigation of the conversion of triplex to invasion
complexes was done by monitoring the time course of the
reactions in a low ionic strength buffer (Figure 5). The triplex
is formed very rapidly and the amount of this complex
reaches its maximal value already at the first time point
(30 s), and then diminishes as invasion complexes emerge
(Figure 5). A control experiment in which surplus of an
oligonucleotide complementary to the PNA was added at
30 s of incubation completely inhibited the formation of
invasion complexes presumably by trapping free PNA. In
contrast, the amount of triplex produced at this time point
remained constant over the entire experiment indicating no
dissociation of this complex (data not shown). Therefore,
these results confirm that a direct transformation of a PNA–
dsDNA ‘Hoogsteen’ type triplex into a PNA–DNA–PNA,
DNA invasion complex does indeed take place.
Although the investigated triplexes are stable in the
absence of excess PNA oligomer, the base-pair alterations
of the Hoogsteen PNA strand observed upon transformation
of PDI15 to PDIII15 suggest that remodelling of the Hoog-
steen PNA strand may take place upon helix invasion by
a Watson–Crick binding PNA strand.
The experiments in this study were performed at slightly
acidic pH to facilitate protonation of cytosine N3. To demon-
strate that the results extend to a physiologically relevant pH,
an analogous experiment was carried out at pH 7.3 using
a pentadecamer homopyrimidine PNA oligomer containing
pseudoisocytosine (18) instead of cytosine. Binding of this
PNA to the target gave rise to a multitude of complexes
analogously to what was observed for the corresponding
cytosine PNA (Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, the
results underline that the specific complexes formed as well
as their migration in the gel depend on the specific PNA
oligomer used. In particular, the sequence will of course
dictate which complexes are stable, but other chemical
modification (such as charge) may also be of importance.
CONCLUSION
The first conclusion drawn from the present work is
that extending the strand length of homopyrimidine PNA

oligomers increases the structural heterogeneity of resul-
ting sequence targeted PNA–dsDNA complexes and this
increased product complexity is due to the formation of
kinetically trapped (but thermodynamically suboptimal)
complexes involving compromised PNA strand orientation
and incomplete base pairing. Thus, target selectivity of
helix invasion is expected to be reduced when addressing
longer than decamer sequences because kinetically stable
complexes that do not involve recognition of the entire target
can be formed. Indeed, we observe only limited differences
of binding efficiency when targeting decamer, dodecamer
and pentadecamer dsDNA targets by a pentadecamer
homopyrimidine PNA via helix invasion (unpublished data).
Such extended dsDNA sequences may, however, be targe-
ted using modular constructs containing PNA oligomer
conjugated to small molecule DNA binding agents such as
the minor groove binder Hoechst (39). In this approach, the
sequence preference of the minor groove binder selects
a subset of targets via equilibrium interactions with its own
target, which is followed by PNA helix invasion at sites
that contain an adjacent PNA target.
It is important to emphasize that the binding diversity and
target discrimination described for the PNA oligomers is
a consequence of kinetic control and not of thermodynamic
equilibrium because of the very high stability and thus long
life times of the complexes (40). This is analogous to the
trapping of meta-stable intermediates in RNA folding (41)
as well as protein folding (42), which can result in incorrectly
folded and dysfunctional structures. In most protein–DNA
interactions, the affinity has been tuned by evolution (perhaps
to avoid this type of kinetic trapping) such that sequence
specificity is controlled by thermodynamics.
The second conclusion is that it is possible to stably target
single sites in dsDNA via a triplex strategy when using
homopyrimidine PNA oligomers longer than 12mer. Previous
investigations have reported the formation of triplexes
between PNA oligomers and complementary dsDNA targets
(26,43) but so far there has been no structural characterization
of such complexes. Detailed studies addressing the specificity
and affinity of such PNA–dsDNA triplex interactions are
under way in order to explore whether this approach has
advantages over other triplex targeting strategies (3,4).
The third conclusion from the present work is that a stable
non-invasion ‘Hoogsteen type’ triplex homopyrimidine
PNA–dsDNA intermediate can be directly converted into a
helix invasion P-loop complex involving combined Hoog-
steen and Watson–Crick base pairs. Thus the ‘Hoogsteen
first’ mechanism is valid at least for the employed pentade-
camer under the present conditions. However, we are not
able to conclude that this is the general mechanism for
triplex invasion, since PNA sequence (especially C-content)
and strand length as well as template topology and dynamics
(e.g. resulting from the activity of DNA processing enzymes)
may alter the mechanism of P-loop formation.
