Summary 
Aflatoxins, highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds that frequently contaminate foods and feeds, are 
produced by several genera in the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillusflavus, the most common species causing 
crop contamination, is a common inhabitant of the Sonoran desert of North America where it resides in 
complex communities composed of diverse individuals. This diversity reflects divergent adaptation to 
various ecological niches. Some A. flavus isolates that re well adapted to plant associated niches do not 
produce aflatoxins yet have the capacity to competitively exclude aflatoxin producers. These atoxigenic 
strains can serve as biological control agents for management of aflatoxins in crops. Detailed knowledge 
of the ecology of aflatoxin-producing fungi may lead to novel practical methods for limiting 
contamination.

Introduction 
Serious economic loss results from aflatoxin 
contamination in the warm agricultural produc- 
tion regions of the United States where the 
frequency of aflatoxin contamination may limit 
crop choices over millions of hectares. Afla- 
toxins are a group of highly potent mycotoxins 
that contaminate foods as a result of crop 
infection by some members of Aspergillus 
section Flavi. Four aflatoxins (B1, B2, G~, and 
G2) are produced by Aspergilli in crops. 
Aflatoxin B~ is both the most common and the 
most oxic and, as a result, is the aflatoxin most 
stringently regulated, and probably the major 
toxicosis threat. Presence of aflatoxins in human 
foods may cause chronic health effects including 
immune-system suppression, impaired childhood 
development, and cancer. Acute poisoning can 
result in death (1, 2). However, in developed 
countries, aflatoxins are most frequently 
recognized ue to loss in crop value, resulting 
from strict government regulations on maximum 
permissible levels in crops and crop

related products (3, 4). In crops intended for 
human consumption, maximum permitted aria- 
toxin levels range from 2 ppb aflatoxin B1 (4 ppb 
total aflatoxins) in the European Union to 20 ppb 
total aflatoxins in the United States. Small pro- 
portions of crop aflatoxin content are transferred 
from feed to milk causing even feed crops to 
have stringent regulations for use at dairies (4, 
5). Aflatoxins impact he U.S. cotton industry 
because dairies pay a premium for cottonseed 
that must contain less than 20 ppb to enter the 
dairy feed market. Areas with severe con- 
tamination frequently have cottonseed xceeding 
1,000 ppb aflatoxins. In the U.S., crops with 
over 300 ppb are prohibited from being fed to 
any animal. Rotation crops (particularly maize 
and peanuts) are frequently also affected and 
production of these is often limited by 
frequencies and severity of aflatoxin 
contamination (3). Aflatoxin contamination 
events frustrate all that handle, market, or utilize 
crops from highly vulnerable regions. The crop 
may have no visible symptoms, and yet contain 
enough aflatoxins to either severely reduce value 
or completely eliminate available markets. The 
same fungal isolates may cause contamination f 
several crops grown in a given area, such as 
cottonseed, corn, peanuts, and pecans in South 
Texas. Although conditions favoring contamina- 
tion may not be the same for all crops, culturing 
any crop, susceptible or not, influences the 
110 
Mycotoxin Research Vol. 22, No. 2 (2006), 110-117 
complex communities of aflatoxin-producing 
fungi resident in fields (6) and as a result 
influences both the fungi to which the next crop 
will be exposed and, it may be suggested, the 
extent of contamination. I fluences of cropping 
patterns and practices on communities of 
aflatoxin-producing fungi suggest hat these 
fungi have complex and, perhaps, variable 
ecologies (7). The most important fungi causing 
contamination f a crop with aflatoxins are not 
necessarily primarily adapted to those crops. 
Yet, both the primary niches to which these 
fungi are adapted and the br adth of ecological 
roles these fungi play have been incompletely 
described. Improved knowledge of the ecology 
of the fungi that contaminate crops with 
aflatoxins may be the key to improved 
management of his severe mycotoxin problem. 
Aflatoxins in the Sonoran desert 
In the lower Sonoran Desert of Arizona, USA, 
there is a diverse agricultural system with 
complex crop rotations. Though aflatoxin 
contamination is ot a concern for many of these 
crops, Aspergillus flavus can be readily 
cultivated from soil from virtually every field (8- 
10). Much of the organic matter resident in field 
soil is colonized by A. flavus during the warm 
summer months (11-14). This general paradigm 
is not restricted to frequently worked and 
irrigated agricultural fie ds, but also applies to 
the native Sonoran desert, noted for it's large 
saguaro cacti and leguminous trees. Grid 
sampling of uncultivated esert soils reveal 
propagules ofA. flavus to be frequent and widely 
dispersed in native soils; high A.flavus pro- 
pagule counts are associated with decomposing 
debris of many desert plants (10). Indeed, 
contamination of native desert plants with 
dangerous levels of aflatoxins is known and 
probably represents a source ofpre-agricultural 
aflatoxin exposure of the indigenous peoples of 
North America (11). Furthermore, most in- 
dividual insects of many species trapped in the 
Sonoran desert in association with crops are 
colonized by A. flavus either superficially and 
internally (15). The air in this region also 
contains A. flavus year ound (16). Large quanti- 
ties of airborne A.flavus propagules are 
especially evident during periods of summer 
crop harvest during which weekly average pro- 
pagule counts frequently exceed 50 cfu/m 3(16). 
Residence in the Sonoran desert of native and 
domestic animals, plants, and humans, since 
before the onset of agriculture, has meant 
frequent exposure to A.flavus through dermal 
contact, ingestion, and respiration. Humans 
foraging on native plants imilarly were exposed 
to aflatoxins long before the advent of North 
American agriculture (11). 
Adaptations of aflatoxin-producing fungi 
The communities of aflatoxin-producing fungi 
resident in both agricultural and native 
ecosystems in the southwestern United States 
have a complexity that reflects the diverse 
geography and numerous substrates and hosts in 
which these species are found growing and 
reproducing across the Sonoran Desert. In 
keeping with the ability to reproduce in diverse 
econiches, A.flavus can utilize a wide array of 
natural substrates, including the proteins elastin 
and mucin, as well as complex carbohydrates 
such as cellulose, chitin, pectin and xylan (17). 
In fact, elastinolytic protease activities are highly 
conserved in Aspergillus section Flavi (18) 
suggesting that natural sources of proteins like 
elastin (e.g. insects, mammals) may provide 
stable nutrient reserves for the fungus in niches 
required for long-term survival. The exact roles 
of elastases in niche occupation are not clear. 
However, proteinase digestive ability is dis- 
played by isolates of A.flavus obtained from 
cottonseed, corn, peanuts, soil, insects and 
human (18, 19). A. flavus also has the ability to 
use complex carbohydrates as substrates, and has 
the capacity to secrete a wide array of fungal 
hydrolases. Both Pectinases and Xylanases are 
carbohydrate hydrolases that have been observed 
in A.flavus. These enzymes play roles in the 
maceration ofplant issues. The conservation f
pectinases and xylanases vary with xylanase 
activity strongly conserved and certain pectinase 
activities highly variable in Aspergillus ection 
Flavi (20-22). 
Aspergillus flavus may be divided into two 
morphotypes, the S and L strains (23). Each 
morphotype is divided into many clonal ineages 
(called vegetative compatibility groups or 
VCGs) by a vegetative compatibility s stem that 
limits gene flow among dissimilar individuals 
(24, 25). Both morphotypes and VCGs differ in 
many characteristics; the most frequently studied 
is aflatoxin-producing ability (8, 26, 27). The S 
strain produces, on average, much higher 
concentrations of aflatoxins than the L strain, 
and, as a result, the S strain is a primary target 
111 
Mycotoxin Research Vol. 22, No. 2 (2006), 110-117 
for management of aflatoxin contamination. 
Certain L strain VCGs also produce very large 
concentrations of aflatoxins. However, L strain 
VCGs vary widely in aflatoxin-producing ability 
and many L strain VCGs produce very low 
concentrations of aflatoxins (8, 28). Some of 
these isolates produce no aflatoxins at all and are 
termed atoxigenic (29). Aflatoxin-producing 
ability has a tendency to be similar among 
members of the same VCG and certain atoxi- 
genic VCGs have uniform atoxigenicity among 
those isolates examined (26, 30). The molecular 
basis for atoxigenicity is known in some cases 
(30, 31). Many of these isolates have deterior- 
ated components ofthe 65 to 70 kb gene cluster 
that contains the aflatoxin biosynthesis genes. 
This deterioration probably reflects lack of 
selective advantage for aflatoxin producing 
ability in key niches occupied by the atoxigenic 
strains. 
Aflatoxin producing ability does not influence 
fungal virulence to plants, at least not to cotton 
(23). However, A. flavus isolates do vary widely 
in virulence to plants (23). This is attributed, at 
lease in part, to variation in pectinase pro- 
duction. As mentioned above, pectinase 
production isnot as highly conserved asprotease 
production. Failure to express aspecific pectin- 
ase during cotton-boll infection is associated 
with reduced virulence (22, 32-34). These low 
pectinase-producing A.flavus isolates lack 
ability to readily utilize an important class of 
plant polysaccharide and have reduced ability to 
rot plant tissues and ramify through infected 
organs. Yet, these isolates are maintained within 
the complex communities of aflatoxin-producing 
fungi resident in the Sonoran Desert (20). The 
complexity ofpectinase polymorphisms appears 
to be larger than first suspected. The capacity for 
pectinase production (P2c) can vary tremen- 
dously in both S and L A.flavus strains, 
depending on the niche to which an isolate is 
adapted (20, 35). Many of these pectinase 
deficient lineages produce large quantities of 
aflatoxins and still have the ability to con- 
taminate crops with significant levels of 
aflatoxins. Variation in pectinase production 
may reflect divergent adaptation within A. flavus 
with certain lineages possibly adapted to 
ecological niches where constitutive expression 
of pectinase is not advantageous. Even though 
the pectinase deficient A.flavus may not be 
specifically adapted o crops and aflatoxin-pro- 
ducing capacity is not related to virulence, these 
A. flavus strains till can infect cotton bolls and 
cause significant contamination (20). On the 
other hand, it is clear from the extent of 
atoxigenic strain occurrence inagricultural soils 
and on crops that many A. flavus isolates that do 
not produce aflatoxins are well adapted to the 
crop environment (8, 28, 36). A lack of 
relationship between aflatoxin-producing ability 
and virulence to crops led to the suggestion that 
atoxigenic strains might be able to compete with 
aflatoxin-producers in crop environments and 
during crop colonization and, as a result 
competitively exclude aflatoxin producers and 
reduce aflatoxin contamination (23, 29, 37). 
Biological control 
All communities of aflatoxin-producing fungi 
examined to date are complex and composed of 
strains that vary widely in several characteristics 
(8, 28, 38, 39). Although, all are complex, the 
proportion of strains and VCGs with various 
aflatoxin-producing abilities varies widely 
among communities resident in different fields, 
valleys, and regions (8) and, as a result, the 
average aflatoxin-producing ability of those 
communities also varies. Fungal communities 
resident in various locations may differ widely in 
aflatoxin-producing potentials (8, 28, 40). Clear- 
ly, crops infected by fungal communities with 
relatively low aflatoxin-producing potential will 
become contaminated to a lesser extent han 
crops infected by communities with very-high 
aflatoxin-producing abilities, if all other con- 
ditions are held constant. If the aflatoxin- 
producing potential of fungal communities 
resident in an area could be influenced, then the 
extent to which crops in that area become 
contaminated would also be affected. Crop 
breeders and other aflatoxin researchers practice 
this principle routinely when they spread food 
sources colonized by highly toxigenic isolates of 
A. flavus or A. parasiticus in order to increase 
the extent and uniformity of crop aflatoxin 
content (40, 42-44). The assumption is that hese 
applications have little influence outside of the 
treated plots. However, a decade of experience 
with tracking applied atoxigenic strains of A. 
flavus after application to commercial fields 
indicates that such applications invariably have 
influences well beyond both the treated plots and 
the year of application (45-47). 
Just as the environment is occupied by mixtures 
ofaflatoxin-producing a d closely related fungi, 
112 
Mycotoxin Research Vol. 22, No. 2 (2006), 110-117 
crops become associated with and infected by 
complex strain mixtures that include individuals 
that vary widely in aflatoxin-producing ability 
(9, 48). Co-infecting strains modulate aflatoxin 
production by each other, and certain atoxigenic 
strains (vegetative compatibility groups that do 
not produce aflatoxins) have the ability to 
markedly reduce or eliminate aflatoxin pro- 
duction by highly toxigenic strains during 
coinfection (29, 49, 50). Increasing the frequen- 
cy of this natural interference with seed 
contamination by atoxigenic strains would 
reduce the extent to which crops become 
contaminated. This can be achieved by in- 
creasing the proportion of atoxigenic strains 
within fungal communities a sociated with crops 
(51). 
Management strategies directed at utilizing 
atoxigenic strains as biological controls to limit 
aflatoxin contamination have been pursued for 
almost wo decades (52, 53). These strategies 
seek to competitively exclude aflatoxin 
producers from crops with strains of A.flavus 
that do not produce aflatoxins and have the 
potential to interfere with the contamination 
process. The displacement results in both 
reduced incidences of aflatoxin producers 
throughout the environment a d reduced crop 
aflatoxin contamination. Aflatoxin prevention 
technologies based on atoxigenic strains of A. 
flavus and A. parasiticus are being developed for 
several crops (45, 46, 52, 54). Such technologies 
deliver atoxigenic strains on nutritive solid sub- 
strates (55, 56) formulated to provide adequate 
stability and handling characteristics foron farm 
use in target areas (56). Those technologies that 
have been developed commercially all rely on 
nutritive substrates to provide the atoxigenic 
strain initial advantage upon application. 
The timing of atoxigenic strain applications i
key to successful displacement of aflatoxin 
producers. For atoxigenic strains ofA. flavus to 
be useful during crop production, they must be 
applied at a time and manner that allows 
successful competition with aflatoxin-producers 
(3, 5). In theory, application of an atoxigenic 
strain when overall A.flavus levels are low, 
provides preferential exposure to the crop and an 
advantage in competing for crop resources (5, 6). 
Atoxigenic strains are routinely applied once per 
crop at 10 lb to 20 lb per acre, depending on the 
crop treated (46, 52). 
Commercial use of atoxigenic strains 
Atoxigenic strains are considered biopesticides 
and, as such, use of atoxigenic strains must 
comply with pesticide law. Pesticide registra- 
tions for various atoxigenic strains are currently 
available for both cotton and peanuts and interest 
has been expressed inregistrations for corn, figs, 
and pistachios (57). Experimental use registra- 
tions have allowed treatment of commercial 
cotton in Arizona since 1996 (47). Strains are 
applied by ground or air immediately after lay by 
(46). Treatments increase incidences of the 
applied atoxigenic strain within A.flavus 
communities associated with the crops and 
resident in soils. This reduces both the average 
aflatoxin-producing potential of the communities 
and the quantity of aflatoxins in the crop (54, 
58). Treatments do not increase the overall 
quantity of A. flavus on the crop at harvest or 
after ginning (46). There is an inverse relation- 
ship between i cidences of the applied strain on 
seed and concentrations ofaflatoxins in the seed 
(54). Fungi associated with crops in the field 
may remain with the crop during harvest, storage 
and processing (3, 58). Thus, vulnerability to 
aflatoxin contamination remains until crops are 
used and atoxigenic strains remain with crops, 
providing postharvest protection (58-60). 
Changes to the average aflatoxin-producing 
potential of A. flavus communities induced by 
atoxigenic strain applications typically last 
multiple years (45-47). Thus, cumulative bene- 
fits may be expected both through infuences on 
fields adjacent to treated fields and through 
repeated treatments hrough sequences of crop 
rotation. Atoxigenic strain applications may 
provide area-wide benefits (46) and this is a 
major goal of some aflatoxin management 
programs utilizing atoxigenic strain tech- 
nologies. By reducing the aflatoxin-producing 
potential ofA. flavus communities throughout an 
area, vulnerabilities of all crops grown in that 
area may be reduced. Similarly, aflatoxin 
reductions throughout the environment should be 
realized. This is a major target of producers that 
rotate between susceptible crops (i.e. cotton, 
peanuts, and corn) or that may have susceptible 
crops in nearby fields (i.e. figs or pistachios). 
The concept of a technology that might provide 
cumulative, long-term reductions in vulnerability 
of all crops in a region to contamination ffers 
some regions the hope of either growing crops 
no longer grown as a result of frequent 
113 
Mycotoxin Research Vol. 22, No. 2 (2006), 110-117 
contamination r of reducing along felt burden 
diminishing the profitability of farming 
operations. Few farmers also consider that such 
technologies reduce the incidences of aflatoxin- 
producing fungi throughout the environment in 
which the farmers live and in so doing reduce the 
incidences ofaflatoxins that are born throughout 
the soil and air in both fungal structures (61, 62) 
and the dust and fines of crops (63, 64). 
Several laboratories have demonstrated that 
applications of atoxigenic strains can reduce 
both the average aflatoxin-producing potential of 
fungal communities and the aflatoxin content of 
crops (51, 52, 57, 65). In 1996 the first com- 
mercial fields were treated with atoxigenic 
strains when about 55 hectares of cotton were 
treated with an atoxigenic strain under an 
Experimental Use Permit pesticide registration. 
Since that time over 50,000 hectares of cotton 
has been treated. However, the extent o which 
atoxigenic strain technology is utilized is 
dependent on the economics of contamination. 
Not all areas with some contamination have 
sufficient contamination to warrant reatments 
and in areas with frequent contamination, as
effective treatments are made, economic justi- 
fication for continued treatments declines. Thus, 
in some regions, cost-benefit analyses will result 
in discontinuation f treatments before full and 
cumulative benefits are reached. In 1998 the 
Arizona cotton industry decided to adapt atoxi- 
genie strain technology to address their long- 
standing aflatoxin problem (46, 66). The farmers 
of Arizona committed money and resources to 
develop the technology on a commercial scale. 
This included apartnership with the Agricultural 
Research Service to develop acommercial scale 
facility to produce atoxigenic strain material at 
low cost. The object of this was to keep the 
economic benefits of such technology atthe farm 
gate. However, even with such low cost material, 
in some regions the frequency of contamination 
does not warrant treatment. 
Other mycotoxins 
It is not clear whether biocontrol strategies 
similar to those mploying atoxigenic strains to 
limit aflatoxin contamination might be 
developed to reduce other mycotoxin problems. 
Not all mycotoxin-producing fungi should be 
expected to retain the level of ecological com- 
petence required to competitively exclude 
mycotoxin producers after mycotoxin production 
is lost. Atoxigenic strains of A. flavus are very 
common in crop environments (8, 38, 39), this is 
not the case for some important mycotoxin 
producers (67-69). High incidences ofatoxigenic 
strains in the crop environment imply that these 
strains are well adapted to crop associated 
niches. High conservation fproduction of large 
concentrations of a mycotoxin among isolates 
associated with crops may indicate that the 
mycotoxin in question plays a key role in either 
competition or survival in that niche. However, 
the mycotoxigenic phenotype maymerely be a 
fixated character that is neutral in the crop 
associated niche. Use of atoxigenic strains as 
management tools has been explored for several 
mycotoxins. Atoxigenic strains of Pithomyces 
chartarum have been used to reduce spori- 
desmin-producing strains in New Zealand 
pastures and in so doing reduce facial eczema in 
sheep and cattle (67, 70). However, atoxigenicity 
is apparently a rare trait in Pithomyces (67). 
Similarly, the possibility that isolates of 
Fusarium verticilliodes that do not produce 
fumonisins might be used to limit fumonisin 
contamination has been discussed and demon- 
strated (71). However, fumonisin production 
appears to be highly conserved in F. verti- 
cilliodes, although fumonisins apparently do not 
play a role in virulence to maize (72). In these 
cases, non-producers may be insufficiently 
competitive with toxigenic strains (68-69). In 
addition, the possible use of competitive x- 
clusion to reduce deoxynivatenol (DON) in 
wheat has been demonstrated with strains of 
F. graminearum genetically engineered to 
eliminate DON biosynthesis (73). Even though 
F. graminearum strains that do not produce 
DON have reduced virulence there may still be 
potential for the DON-minus trains that cause 
few disease symptoms yet colonize host tissues, 
to influence DON contamination. If these 
systems are anything like the aflatoxin system, 
successful development of any of these strategies 
will require prolonged commitment of both 
researchers and producers.
