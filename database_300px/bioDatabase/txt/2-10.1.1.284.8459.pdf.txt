ABSTRACT
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is
pivotal for delivery of the initiator tRNA (tRNAi) to the
ribosome. Here, we report the functional character-
ization of the archaeal homologue, a/eIF2. We have
cloned the genes encoding the three subunits of
a/eIF2 from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus
solfataricus, and have assayed the activities of the
purified recombinant proteins in vitro. We demon-
strate that the trimeric factor reconstituted from the
recombinant polypeptides has properties similar to
those of its eukaryal homologue: it interacts with
GTP and Met-tRNAi, and stimulates binding of the lat-
ter to the small ribosomal subunit. However, the
archaeal protein differs in some functional aspects
from its eukaryal counterpart. In contrast to eIF2,
a/eIF2 has similar affinities for GDP and GTP, and
the b-subunit does not contribute to tRNAi binding.
The detailed analysis of the complete trimer and of its
isolated subunits is discussed in light of the evolu-
tionary history of the eIF2-like proteins.
INTRODUCTION
During translation initiation, ribosomes identify the initiation
codon on the mRNA and set the correct reading frame for
decoding. This rate-limiting step is carried out in different
ways in the primary domains of cell descent. In bacteria,
the small ribosomal subunit interacts directly with the
mRNA by base-pairing of the Shine–Dalgarno (SD) motif,
preceding the initiation codon, with the anti-SD motif at the
30 end of 16S rRNA. The initiation step is assisted by three
protein factors, IF1, IF2 and IF3 (1,2). In eukarya, selection
of the initiation codon entails a ‘scanning’ mechanism,
whereby the 40S subunit binds to the capped 50 end of the
mRNA and then slides downstream until the initiator AUG,
usually the first one available, is encountered (3). This process
is promoted by many factors, several of which are involved in
cap recognition and mRNA unwinding, while others interact
with the ribosome and/or the mRNA to ensure correct selec-
tion of the initiation codon (4,5).
In archaea, two different mechanisms for translational ini-
tiation seem to exist (6,7). One is based on a canonical SD/
anti-SD interaction and operates on internal cistrons of poly-
cistronic mRNAs. In contrast, monocistronic mRNAs as well
as proximal cistrons of polycistronic mRNAs are frequently
devoid of a 50-untranslated region. These leaderless mRNAs
are decoded by an initiation mechanism independent of the
SD/anti-SD interaction, which requires, analogously to
bacteria (8), pairing of the start codon with initiator-tRNA
(tRNAi) (7). The complexity of archaeal translational initi-
ation seems to be underscored by the presence of a larger-than-
bacterial set of initiation factors. All archaeal genomes encode
about 10 proteins homologous to eukaryal initiation factors
(9,10).
A central step in translation initiation is the delivery of
tRNAi to the ribosomal P site. This task is assisted in bacteria
by the monomeric protein IF2, and is performed in eukarya
by the trimeric complex eIF2, consisting of the a-, b-, and
g-subunits, none of which is homologous to bacterial IF2.
Eukarya possess a homologue of bacterial IF2, termed
eIF5B, which seems to act at a later initiation step, promoting
the joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S initiation
complex (11). Like eukarya, archaea possess both IF2 and
eIF2 homologues, but their respective functions remain poorly
characterized.
In this study, we have analysed a number of functional
features of the eIF2-like protein (herein denoted as a/eIF2)
of the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus.

The genome of this organism, as well as those of the other
archaea sequenced so far, contains homologues of all three
subunits of the eukaryal factor (12). In S.solfataricus, the
largest subunit is the g-homologue, which comprises 415
amino acids and contains a recognizable G-domain. The
a-subunit homologue contains 266 amino acids. The b-subunit
is the smallest polypeptide of a/eIF2 (139 amino acids in
S.solfataricus) and has experienced the most extensive evolu-
tionary drift with respect to the eukaryotic protein. Indeed,
eukaryotic b-subunits are about twice the size of archaeal
ones, and include domains involved in the interaction with
two other proteins essential for eIF2 function: eIF2B, a factor
required for GDP/GTP exchange (13,14) and eIF5, necessary
for the hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP (14–16). Neither eIF2B
nor eIF5 have homologues in archaeal genomes. The con-
served region of the b-subunit in archaea and eukaryotes
includes a domain containing a zinc-finger motif, which has
been implicated in controlling the accuracy of initiation codon
recognition (17). Recently, it has been shown that the recom-
binant a-, b- and g-subunits of a/eIF2 from the hyperthermo-
philic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi can re-associate in vitro to
form a trimer able to bind selectively Met-tRNAi (18). The
tRNA binding site seems to reside on the g-subunit (19),
however an a–g dimer is required for a stable interaction
with Met-tRNAi (18).
In this work, we have cloned the genes and purified the
corresponding three subunits of a/eIF2 from the crenarchaeon
S.solfataricus. In vitro assays carried out with the individual
a/eIF2 subunits, with dimers thereof and with the complete
trimer have confirmed that the factor binds Met-tRNAi, and
that this GTP-dependent binding requires the a–g dimer. We
also show that a/eIF2 a–g and a–b–g strongly stimulate bind-
ing of Met-tRNAi to the small ribosomal subunit in the pres-
ence of GTP. Furthermore, an analysis of guanine nucleotide
exchange has revealed that a/eIF2 has a similar affinity for
GTP and GDP, and that the G nucleotide binding properties of
the isolated g-subunit are similar to those of the complete
factor. In addition, the g-subunit was found to be responsible
for the interaction of the factor with ribosomes. Finally, we
show that a/eIF2 lacks an intrinsic ribosome-dependent
GTPase activity. The differences and similarities with the
eukaryal factor are discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning of the genes and purification of the
a/eIF2 subunits
The genes encoding the a-, b- and g-subunits of a/eIF2 were
cloned by means of PCR amplification from Sulfolobus
solfataricus genomic DNA: 30–35mer oligonucleotides com-
plementary to the 50 and 30 ends of the respective coding
sequences were used, which contained appropriate restriction
sites for insertion into the expression plasmid pRSETB
(Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmids were selected in
E.coli Top10 (Invitrogen), and then transformed into E.coli
BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). The expression of the a/eIF2 genes
was induced for 3 h with 1 mM IPTG at an OD600 of 0.5–0.6.
The cells were then lysed and the extracts were enriched for
the thermophilic recombinant proteins by heating at 70C for
10 min followed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min
to remove the precipitated host proteins. The recombinant
polypeptides, which contained an N-terminal tag of six his-
tidines, were purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA
agarose following standard protocols. The purified proteins
were dialysed against storage buffer (10 mM MOPS,
200 mM KCl, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol)
and stored at 80C in aliquots.
Interaction between the a/eIF2 polypeptides
To test whether the recombinant polypeptides interact and
form dimeric and trimeric complexes, 30 pmol of a-, b-
and g-proteins were mixed in all possible combinations in a
buffer containing 30 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.1, in the presence or absence of 1 mM GTP.
The proteins and their complexes were visualized by non-
denaturing electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels pre-
pared in acetate buffer (120 mM potassium acetate and 72 mM
acetic acid, pH 4.3). The gels included a stacking overlay of
4% polyacrylamide in acetate buffer (120 mM potassium
acetate and 12 mM acetic acid, pH 6.8). The running buffer
was 133 mM acetic acid and 350 mM b-alanine, pH 4.4. After
the run, the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.
Preparation of ribosomes and tRNAi
70S ribosomes and 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits were
obtained from frozen S.solfataricus cells as described previ-
ously (20). Purified tRNAi was obtained by in vitro trans-
cription of a synthetic S.solfataricus tRNAi gene. Two DNA
oligomers were created based on the sequence of the S.sol-
fataricus tRNAi gene as deduced from the published genome
sequence (12). The following oligonucleotides were used:
tRNAi: 50-GTGTAATACGACTCACTATAAGCGGGGT-
GGGCTAGCCTGGTAAGGCCGCGGGGCTCATAACC-
CCGAGGTCCCTGGTTCAAATCCAGGCCCCGCTAC-
CA-30.
anti-tRNAi: 50-AGCTTGGTAGCGGGGCCTGGATTTGA-
ACCAGGGACCTCGGGGTTATGAGCCCCGCGGCCT-
TACCAGGCTAGCCCACCCCGCTTATAGTGAGTCG-
TATTACACGTA-30.
The tRNAi primer contained a T7 promoter directly adjacent
to the tRNAi gene allowing in vitro transcription of an oli-
goribonucleotide initiating with the 50-terminal A of Met-
tRNAi. For plasmid construction, the oligomers were phos-
phorylated, mixed and annealed to form double-stranded DNA
by heating at 100C followed by slow cooling to 37C. This
DNA fragment was then ligated into plasmid pBS-SK (Strata-
gene) digested with DraIII and HindIII. The ligation mix-
ture was transformed in E.coli Top10 cells. The recombinant
plasmid (pBS-tRNAi) was sequenced to verify the authentic
gene sequence. To obtain tRNAi, 25 nM of pBS-tRNAi were
incubated with 2.5 U of Pwo DNA polymerase in 100 ml of
25 mM KCl, 5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 200 mM dNTP, 10 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 8.8, and 600 nM of the following primers: for-
ward primer: 50-GGCCCACTACGTGTAATACGACTCAC-
30; reverse primer: 50-TGGTAGCGGGGCCTGGATTTGAA-
CCAGGG-30. The amplified fragment was purified using the
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The tRNAi was then
transcribed at 37C for 1 h in 100 ml of a mixture containing
50 U of T7 RNA polymerase, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine,
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 6 1805
10 mM DTT, 40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mM of each NTP
and 10 U RNAse inhibitor. As transcription initiated with an A
residue, high concentrations of PCR product (50–60 pmol/
100 ml) were used. The reaction mixture was extracted once
with phenol, once with phenol/chloroform and finally with
chloroform/isoamylalcohol. The RNA was precipitated with
ethanol, dried and resuspended in an appropriate volume of
diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O. That the transcript indeed
initiated with a 50-terminal A was experimentally verified by
primer extension.
The purified tRNAi was charged with methionine, cold or
labelled with [35S], using a recombinant E.coli methyltrans-
ferase: Briefly, 200 pmol of tRNAi were incubated at 37C
for 30 min with 150 pmol methyltransferase, 4 mM ATP
and 100 mM [35S]methionine [specific activity (s.a.)
1000 Ci/mmol] or unlabelled methionine as required. To
check the efficiency of aminoacylation, 100 pmol of Met-
tRNAi was loaded on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel made in
0.1 M NaOAc, pH 5 and 8 M urea. The gel was run for
24 h at 500 V (12 V/cm) and then stained with ethidium
bromide. The bands corresponding to Met-tRNAi and unchar-
ged tRNAi were quantified using the ImageQuant software;
35% of the tRNAi was found to be aminoacylated under
these conditions. To recover the charged Met-tRNAi, the
incubation mixture was subjected to phenol extraction. The
RNA precipitated with ethanol from the aqueous phase was
finally resuspended in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.2.
Guanine nucleotides binding and exchange
The purified a/eIF2 subunits (20 pmol each), alone or in com-
binations, were incubated for 10 min at 65C in buffer con-
taining 30 mM KCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2,
and 1 mM DTT (incubation buffer) with increasing concen-
trations (0–100 pmol) of [3H]GDP (1300 c.p.m./pmol) or
[32P]GTP (6000 c.p.m./pmol). The samples were filtered
through Millipore 0.22 mm nitrocellulose disks, which were
washed extensively with incubation buffer. The disks were
dried and the amount of retained radioactivity was measured
in a liquid scintillation counter. The Kd values for nucleotide
binding were determined graphically from Scatchard plots
derived from the binding curves.
To determine the rate of G nucleotides exchange, isolated
g-subunits (100 pmol) or the complete trimer reconstituted
with 100 pmol of each a-, b- and g-subunits were incubated
with a 10-fold excess of [3H]GDP for 10 min at 65C. The
mixtures were supplemented with 10 mM unlabelled GTP or
GTP, and the incubation was continued at 80C while with-
drawing samples after 0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 min. The samples were
filtered through 0.22 mm nitrocellulose disks, which were
washed with incubation buffer, dried and then subjected to
scintillation counting.
[35S]Met-tRNAi interaction with a/eIF2
To assay the capacity of a/eIF2 to interact with [35S]Met-
tRNAi, 50 pmol of the recombinant subunits, individually
or in different combinations, were incubated at different tem-
peratures ranging from 25 to 75C in 20 ml (final volume) of
incubation buffer containing 1 mM GTP and 100 pmol of
[35S]Met-tRNAi (s.a. 500 c.p.m./pmol). Incubation was car-
ried out for 15 min. Samples were withdrawn at times 1, 3, 5,
10 and 15 min. The samples were filtered through 0.22 mm
nitrocellulose disks, which were washed and processed as
described above.
Protection by a/eIF2 of [35S]Met-tRNAi against spontaneous
hydrolysis was assayed in 20 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 8.0),
100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA,
0.2 mg/ml BSA and 5% glycerol, in the presence of 1 mM
GTP, 1 mM GDP or 1 mM Gpp(NH)p, and 50 nM of [35S]Met-
tRNAi and a/eIF2 (0.2 and 2 mM). Before the addition of
[35S]Met-tRNAi, the three subunits were incubated in the pres-
ence of GTP [GDP or Gpp(NH)p] for 10 min at 65C to allow
subunit formation. The mixtures were then incubated at 65C.
To determine the rate of de-acylation, aliquots were withdrawn
at various times (10–30 min) and precipitated with 5% tri-
chloroacetic acid. The precipitates were collected on Whatman
filters, which were washed 2· with ice-cold 5% TCA, and then
dried for 10 min at 85C. The amount of the retained [35S]Met-
tRNAi was determined by scintillation counting.
Interaction of a/eIF2 subunits with ribosomes
To determine which of the a/eIF2 polypeptides contained the
domain for interaction with ribosomes, 50 pmol of each a-, b-
or g-subunit were incubated at 65C for 10 min in incubation
buffer in the presence of 1 mM GTP and 100 pmol of Met-
tRNAi (charged with cold methionine). The samples were
supplemented with 30 pmol of ribosomes and incubation
was continued for another 10 min. The reaction was stopped
by adding an appropriate volume of 10· loading buffer (0.02%
bromophenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol and 50% glycerol),
and the samples were immediately loaded on running non-
denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels made in 20 mM potassium
acetate, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6. Electro-
phoresis was continued at 4C and 50 mA for 4–5 h. After the
run, the samples were transferred to Hybond N membranes by
electroblotting and the position of the recombinant proteins
was visualized by immunostaining with anti-His tagged
antibodies.
Interaction of [35S]Met-tRNAi with ribosomes
The ability of a/eIF2 to stimulate binding of [35S]Met-tRNAi
to ribosomes was tested as follows: 50 pmol of each a-, b- and
g-proteins, or a–g or g only were mixed and incubated for
10 min at 65C in 50 ml incubation buffer with 1 mM GTP
to allow formation of the trimeric or dimeric complexes.
[35S]Met-tRNAi (100 pmol, s.a. 500 c.p.m./pmol) were
added and incubation was continued for 5 min. Finally, the
mixtures were supplemented with 30 pmol of ribosomes and
further incubated for 10 min. The samples were immediately
electrophoresed on non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels
as described above, then dried and exposed to an X-ray
film to visualize the labelled tRNAi. In parallel, the gels
were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to determine the
position of the ribosomes.
GTPase activity assay
The presence of a ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of
trimeric a/e IF2 was assayed as follows: 20 pmol of each
a-, b- and g-subunits were mixed in 50 ml (final volume) of
70 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
1806 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 6
DTT and 35 mM [32P]GTP (s.a. 15 mCi/mmol). The mixture
was incubated for 5 min at 65C to allow formation of the
trimer. Met-tRNAi (20 pmol; charged with unlabelled
methionine) was then added and the incubation was continued
for another 5 min. Then, the reaction mixture was further
supplemented with 5 pmol of 70S ribosomes and 5 pmol of
a 30mer RNA oligonucleotide mimicking a translation initi-
ation region endowed with a SD-motif (50-UUUGAGGUGA-
CUCUCUCAUGUUUUUUUUUU-30: start codon and SD
motif are underlined). Incubation was continued at 65C for
10 min and samples were withdrawn at 0, 1, 5 and 10 min. The
samples were supplemented with an equal volume of 1 M
HClO4 and 2 mM KH2PO4, gently shaken and further supple-
mented with 3 vol of 20 mM Na4MoO4. Finally, an equal
volume of ethyl acetate was added, the mixture was shaken
vigorously and centrifuged for 5 min at 6500 r.p.m. to separate
the phases: 200 ml were withdrawn from the top phase and the
free [32P] present therein was measured in a liquid scintillation
counter.
RESULTS
Purification of the three S.solfataricus a/eIF2 subunits
The genes encoding the a-, b- and g-subunits of S.solfataricus
a/eIF2 were cloned by PCR amplification of genomic DNA
and inserted into the E.coli ‘His-tag vector’ pRSET to facil-
itate purification after over-expression in vivo. The recombin-
ant proteins were purified by a two-step procedure, including
heating of the E.coli lysates at 70C for 10 min to remove most
of the host mesophilic proteins, followed by selective capture
of the recombinant polypeptides by affinity chromatography
on a Ni-NTA resin. As shown in Figure 1, the three recom-
binant polypeptides were purified to near homogeneity. They
had the expected molecular weights of 45 kDa (g-subunit),
28 kDa (a-subunit) and 15 kDa (b-subunit). However, their
yield was markedly different: the a-subunit was produced in
large amounts, whereas the g- and, particularly, the b-subunit
were produced in lower quantities. The histidine-tags were not
removed, since they apparently did not affect the activity
assays, as previously noted for the P.abyssi factor (18).
Interaction between the subunits
The functionality of the purified recombinant polypeptides
was first tested by monitoring their capacity to form dimeric
and trimeric complexes. Equimolar amounts of the a/eIF2
subunits as well as combinations thereof were incubated at
65C for 15 min and then electrophoresed on acidic, non-
denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Figure 2, under
these conditions the three recombinant polypeptides were
competent for mutual recognition. When mixed together in
equimolar amounts, the a-, b- and g-proteins interacted quant-
itatively to reconstitute the trimeric complex; essentially no
free subunits were left over under these conditions (Figure 2).
The quantitative formation of a–g and b–g dimers was like-
wise readily observed, whereas the a- and b-subunits did not
interact with each other. These experiments supported previ-
ous data (18,19) in that the g-subunit acts as a scaffold for
the assembly of the trimer. As S.solfataricus is an extreme
thermophile, we assayed whether temperature affected these
protein–protein interactions. We found that dimeric and tri-
meric complexes formed readily at room temperature, thus
indicating that even at non-physiological temperatures, the
proteins are in an interaction-competent conformation (data
not shown). The polypeptides were able to assemble also in the
presence of GDP as well as without guanine nucleotides,
showing that GTP activation of the g-subunit is not required
for complex formation.
Guanine nucleotide binding and exchange
Having ascertained the ability of the a/eIF2 polypeptides to
reconstitute the native complex, we next analysed the capacity
of the individual subunits and of combinations thereof to bind
GDP and GTP. The aim of these experiments was to compare
the relative affinity for guanine nucleotides of a/eIF2 with
that of its eukaryal counterpart. It is known that the eukaryal
eIF2 has a significantly higher affinity for GDP than for GTP.

the purified a-, b- and g-subunits in the Coomassie blue stained SDS–
polyacrylamide gel are shown by arrows. The molecular weight markers are
(from top to bottom): 90, 67, 45, 30, 21 and 14 kDa.
Figure 2. Reconstitution of the trimeric a/eIF2 with purified subunits. The a-,
b- and g- polypeptides were mixed in equimolar amounts (50 pmol each) and
incubated at 65C for 15 min. The individual subunits and mixtures thereof
were electrophoresed on non-denaturing polyacylamide gels (see Materials and
Methods). It should be noted that in the native gel system the more basic a-
subunits (PI 9.2; 28 kDa) moved slightly ahead of the b-subunits (Isoelectric
point 8.1; 15 kDa) despite the difference in size. Migration of the proteins from
the cathode towards the anode is depicted on the right-hand side.

As a consequence, the conversion of GDP–eIF2 to GTP–eIF2
requires the pentameric nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B
(13). However, archaeal genomes lack apparent homologues
of the catalytic subunits of the eIF2B complex (21), which
could suggest that an exchange factor is not required for
a/eIF2. A 20 pmol of each recombinant subunit of S.solfatari-
cus a/eIF2 was incubated in all possible combinations (except
a–b) with increasing amounts of [3H]GDP or [32P]GTP at
65C, and the amount of bound nucleotide was determined
by a filter-binding assay. The quantitative interaction of the
recombinant subunits, i.e. the formation of dimers and trimers,
was separately verified by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis
(data not shown; see Figure 2).
As shown in Figure 3, the binding curves revealed that the
guanine nucleotide binding capacity resides entirely on the
g-subunit. In fact, protein complexes containing the g-subunit
(a–g , b–g or the trimeric factor) displayed GDP and GTP
binding curves essentially overlapping with those obtained
with the g-subunit alone, while neither a nor b (data not
shown) bound to G nucleotides. These results indicated that
the G-domain on the g-subunit is fully competent for nucle-
otide binding and that binding is not affected by either the a-
or b-subunits. From the binding curves shown in Figure 3, we
calculated the Kd values for GDP and GTP of the g-subunit and
of the trimeric factor. The values (Table 1) were very similar in
all cases, indicating that the G-nucleotide binding domain of
a/eIF2, unlike that of eIF2, has comparable affinities for GDP
and GTP. For verification, we also measured the off-rate for
bound radiolabelled GDP in the presence of an excess of
unlabelled GDP or GTP, for the g-subunit as well as for the
reconstituted a/eIF2 trimer. A 100-fold molar excess of cold
GDP or GTP was added to the g-subunit or to the a/eIF2 trimer,
both of which had been saturated with [3H]GDP. Samples
were withdrawn at different times thereafter to determine
the amount of radioactive nucleotide retained. As shown in
Figure 4, at the optimal growth temperature for S.solfataricus
(80C) bound GDP was substituted by either GDP or GTP at a
comparable rate and nucleotide exchange was complete within
4 min. The g-subunit and the complete trimer behaved sim-
ilarly. Taken together, the binding curves and the exchange
kinetics suggested that the GTP–a/eIF2 complex forms spon-
taneously without an auxiliary factor. These results are in
agreement with the observation that archaeal genomes harbour
only two homologues of the five polypeptides composing the
eukaryal eIF2B, and that these two do not include the catalytic
subunits known to be essential for guanine nucleotide
exchange in eukaryotes (21).
Binding of Met-tRNAi to a/eIF2
The primary role of the eukaryal eIF2 in translation entails the
delivery of tRNAi to ribosomes through formation of a stable
ternary complex with GTP and tRNAi. Recently, it was shown

that archaeal a/eIF2 from P.abyssi, reconstituted in vitro from
the recombinant subunits, has a similar capacity for selective
binding to Met-tRNAi (18). Accordingly, we tested the capa-
city of S.solfataricus a/eIF2 to interact stably with Met-tRNAi
by employing a filter-binding assay.
The three a/eIF2 subunits and combinations thereof were
incubated at 70C in the presence of 1 mM GTP with
S.solfataricus [35S]Met-tRNAi. Samples were withdrawn at
different times upon incubation and filtered through nitrocel-
lulose disks as described above. As shown in Figure 5A, a
stable complex with [35S]Met-tRNAi was formed exclusively
by either the complete trimer or the a–g dimer. The binding
kinetics of these complexes were hardly distinguishable,
demonstrating that the a–g dimer is necessary and sufficient
for the stable interaction with Met-tRNAi, as previously
observed by Yatime et al. (18). At variance with these authors,
we observed very little retention of Met-tRNAi by the isolated
g-subunit. This could be due to the different techniques used in
both studies since filter binding only captures fairly stable
RNA–protein complexes. It is worth noting that Met-tRNAi
binding was strictly dependent on temperature, being very low
at 25C and reaching an optimum between 60 and 75C (data
not shown). At the optimal temperature, saturation was com-
plete within 5 min (Figure 5A). The temperature-dependent
binding of Met-tRNAi cannot be attributed to a lack of inter-
action among the subunits as dimeric and trimeric complexes
formed readily at low temperature (data not shown). Thus, we
assume that this observation is due to a direct effect of high
temperature on the conformation of the Met-tRNAi binding
domain(s) of a/eIF2.
As another means to demonstrate binding to and protection
of Met-tRNAi by a/eIF2, we tested whether the trimeric factor
protects the charged tRNAi from deacylation. Without pro-
tection by a/eIF2 of Met-tRNAi, the tRNA was nearly com-
pletely deacylated after 30 min (Figure 5B). Similarly, in the
presence of GDP, no protection by a/eIF2 of Met-tRNAi was
observed (Figure 5B), verifying that Met-tRNAi binding to
a/eIF2 requires GTP. In contrast, in the presence of 2 mM a/
eIF2 and 1 mM GTP 80% of the tRNAi remained acylated
after 30 min. The addition of non-hydrolysable Gpp(NH)p
had no effect on the protection, which indicated that GTP
is not hydrolysed under these conditions.
Interaction of a/eIF2 with ribosomes
Next, we attempted to determine the a/eIF2 domain respons-
ible for the interaction with ribosomes. High-salt purified S.
solfataricus 70S ribosomes were incubated at 70C for 15 min
with each of the purified a/eIF2 subunits. After incubation, the
samples were loaded on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel
and electrophoresis was continued for 5 h. The position of the
a/eIF2 subunit proteins in the gel was visualized by western
blotting using antibodies directed against the His-tag. Since
free a/eIF2 subunits have a basic isoelectric point and were
expected to run to the anode in the used electrophoresis sys-
tem, only ribosome-associated factors could be detected. As
shown in Figure 6, neither the a- nor the b-subunits was
detectably retained by ribosomes. The g-polypeptide associ-
ated with a band that contained 30S subunits as determined by
Coomassie blue staining (Figure 6) and western blotting using

30S ribosomes (data not shown). We therefore concluded that
the a/eIF2 factor interacts with the small ribosomal subunit by
means of a domain located on the g-subunit.
Stimulation of Met-tRNAi binding to ribosomes
The next experiments were aimed at determining whether
a/eIF2, like its eukaryal counterpart, stimulates the formation
of a pre-initiation complex containing the small ribosomal
subunit and Met-tRNAi. To this end, the reconstituted trimeric
factor was pre-incubated with GTP and [35S]Met-tRNAi to
allow formation of the ternary complex. After 10 min of
pre-incubation, 70S ribosomes were added and the incubation
was continued at 65C for 15 min. The formation of the
pre-initiation complexes was then monitored by means of
non-denaturing gel electrophoresis.
The results shown in Figure 7 illustrate that a/eIF2 did
stimulate binding of Met-tRNAi to the ribosome. The
[35S]Met-tRNAi appeared to interact with the 30S subunits,
even when 70S ribosomes were added to the assay. However,
it should be noted that S.solfataricus ‘70S’ ribosomes are
actually a mixture of dissociated subunits, since the mono-
meric particle is stable only when engaged in translation (20).
A small quantity of the nucleic acid bound to the 30S subunits
in the absence of any factor and the addition of increasing
amounts of a/eIF2 resulted in a linear increase of [35S]Met-
tRNAi associated with the ribosome. We also found that a–g
dimers were indistinguishable from the complete trimer with
regard to their capacity to stimulate [35S]Met-tRNAi binding
to ribosomes which agreed with their Met-tRNAi binding
competence. Interestingly, the isolated g-subunit was also
able to stimulate the interaction of [35S]Met-tRNAi with the
small ribosomal subunit, although to a lesser extent than the
a–g dimer or the complete trimer. This latter result indicated
that the g-polypeptide has some intrinsic capacity for
interacting with Met-tRNAi as well as with the ribosome inde-
pendently of the presence of the other two subunits.
GTP hydrolysis
Lastly, we examined the requirements for triggering hydro-
lysis of GTP bound to the a/eIF2 trimer. First, a/eIF2 was
pre-incubated with GTP and Met-tRNAi at 65C to allow
formation of the ternary complex. Then, we added to the
mixture 70S ribosomes and an oligo-ribonucleotide compris-
ing a strong translation initiation site. In parallel, we verified
by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis the ability of the oligo-
ribonucleotide to bind to ribosomes (data not shown). The
reaction was continued and samples were withdrawn at dif-
ferent times upon incubation. Under these conditions, no
significant GTP hydrolysis was observed (data not shown),
suggesting that the interaction of the factor with the ribosome,
even in the presence of codon–anticodon pairing, is not suf-
ficient by itself to trigger the reaction. This situation is remin-
iscent to eukaryotes, where GTP hydrolysis on eIF2 requires
the auxiliary protein eIF5. However, an eIF5 homologue is
apparently lacking in archaea, raising the possibility that a
hitherto unidentified factor is involved in hydrolysis of GTP
bound to a/eIF2.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have analysed several functional aspects
of the eIF2 homologue from the thermophilic archaeon
S.solfataricus. The purified recombinant a/eIF2 subunits read-
ily assembled in vitro to form dimeric and trimeric complexes.
As observed previously for P.abyssi a/eIF2 (18), we found that
the S.solfataricus a/eIF2 g-subunit constitutes the structural
core of the trimeric complex since it interacts with both a-
and b-subunits as well as individually with either of them.
Figure 7. Stimulation of M-tRNAi binding to ribosomes by a/eIF2: 30 pmol of 70S ribosomes were incubated with [35S]Met-tRNAi and increasing amounts of a/eIF2
(complete trimer,a–g dimer or the g-subunit only). The samples were analysed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (left panel). Lane 1, [35S]Met-tRNAi alone;
lane 2, 70S ribosomes were incubated with [35S]Met-tRNAi without a/eIF2; lanes 3–5, 70S ribosomes were incubated with [35S]Met-tRNAi in the presence of
50 (lane 3), 100 (lane 4) and 150 (lane 5) pmol of the g-subunit; lanes 6–8, 70S ribosomes were incubated with [35S]Met-tRNAi in the presence of 50 (lane 6),
100 (lane 6) and 150 (lane 8) pmol of thea–g dimer; and lanes 9–11, 70S ribosomes were incubated with [35S]Met-tRNAi in the presence of 50 (lane 9), 100 (lane 10)
and 150 (lane 11) pmol of the trimer. The position of the 30S ribosomal subunit (arrow) was determined separately by Coomassie blue staining. The amount of tRNA
bound to ribosomes was quantified using an Instant Imager apparatus (right panel). The total amount of radioactivity in each lane is somewhat variable owing to
deacylation undergone by free Met-tRNAi during the run. Circles, complete trimer; triangles: a–g dimer; and squares, g-subunit.

In contrast, the a- and b-subunits are unable to interact with
each other independent of the g-polypeptide (Figure 2).
Protein–protein recognition is independent of both GTP and
high temperature. The recombinant trimeric S.solfataricus
a/eIF2 displays properties very similar to those of its eukaryal
counterpart: it interacts with Met-tRNAi (Figure 5), and stimu-
lates its binding to the small ribosomal subunits (Figure 7).
Taken together with the results of Yatime et al. (18), we
therefore conclude that a/eIF2 is the principal tRNAi binding
factor in archaea.
The archaeal and eukaryal IF2 factors display several not-
able functional differences, which may aid towards a better
understanding of the evolutionary history of this protein. One
difference concerns the tRNAi-binding site. According to a
recent crystallographic analysis, the g-subunit of P.abyssi
a/eIF2 includes an apparently complete tRNAi-binding
domain similar to that of elongation factor Tu, another transla-
tional G-protein with tRNA-binding properties (19,22). In
agreement with this finding, the g-subunit of a/eIF2 does pos-
sess some intrinsic capacity for Met-tRNAi binding: it protects
the tRNA-bound methionine from alkaline hydrolysis (18),
and it can promote to some extent binding of Met-tRNAi to
the 30S ribosomal subunits (Figure 7). Nevertheless, a stable
interaction with Met-tRNAi is only achieved by a a–g dimer,
and therefore requires the presence of thea-subunit (Figure 5A)
(18). It has been found that the C-terminal portion of the
a-subunit is sufficient for stable tRNA binding (18). However,
the precise role of the a-subunit in Met-tRNAi binding by the
trimeric a/eIF2, or by the a–g complex, remains to be elucid-
ated. In contrast, in eukaryal IF2 the Met-tRNAi binding site
seems to be shared between the g- and the b-subunits (23,24),
while the main function of the a-subunit is the regulation of
the factor activity (25). It should be pointed out that the
eukaryal b-subunit is about twice the size of its archaeal coun-
terpart, and, besides Met-tRNAi binding, is implicated in sev-
eral other essential tasks, such as controlling the interaction
with eIF5 and eIF2B (14–16), and possibly mRNA binding
(26). Only the C-terminal half of the eukaryal polypeptide is
conserved in the archaeal one, while the N-terminal moiety,
containing the interaction domains for eIF2B and eIF5, has
been apparently added during eukaryotic evolution. Therefore,
if the eukaryal b-subunit is involved in the interaction with
tRNAi, this function is most likely acquired during eukaryotic
evolution and not present in the ancestral b-subunit of a/eIF2.
Another relevant functional difference between a/eIF2 and
eIF2 concerns the binding of guanine nucleotides. The
eukaryal protein has a much higher affinity for GDP than
for GTP and requires a GDP/GTP exchange factor, the penta-
meric protein eIF5B, to be reactivated after GTP hydrolysis.
In contrast, the analysis presented here of guanine nucleotide
binding and exchange on a/eIF2 allows the conclusion that the
archaeal factor has a similar affinity for GDP and GTP
(Figures 3 and 4), and therefore might not require an exchange
factor. This agrees with the observation that archaeal genomes
lack a complete eIF5B homologue (21). It is also worth noting
that in lower eukaryotes (yeast), eIF2 seems to have a reduced
requirement for the exchange factor when compared with the
mammalian protein (27). These data suggest the possibility
that the free-nucleotide-exchanging archaeal a/eIF2 represents
the prototype factor from which an exchange factor-dependent
one has evolved in eukaryotes, which provided additional
or even a more sophisticated translational control. Taken
together, these observations would suggest that no eukaryal-
type functional regulation of a/eIF2 based on the inhibition of
guanine nucleotide exchange exists in archaea. However, it
has been recently reported that the a-subunit of Pyrococcus
horikoscii a/eIF2 is phosphorylated by a specific protein kinase
(28). Thus, the determination of the function of a-subunit
phosphorylation of archaeal a/eIF2 will be an interesting
task, which may help to clarify why archaea, unlike bacteria
but like eukarya, have adopted a trimeric Met-tRNAi binding
factor.
Another unresolved problem concerns GTP hydrolysis.
Given the lack of an eIF5 homologue, our expectation was
to find a ribosome-triggered, but otherwise spontaneous,
hydrolysis of a/eIF2-bound GTP. However, all our attempts
to reveal in vitro the presence of such a mechanism failed.
Therefore, the possibility exists that archaea possess a domain-
specific auxiliary GTPase, different from eIF5. Some years
ago, Kyrpides and Woese (21) suggested that the auxiliary
GTPase of a/eIF2 might be aIF2, the universal factor homo-
logous to bacterial IF2 and eukaryal eIF5B. The aIF2 protein is
a G protein and does possess a ribosome-dependent GTPase
activity (A. Berardi, S. Marzi, E. Maone, L. Peri, C. O.
Gualerzi, P. Cammarano and P. Londei, unpublished data).
An interesting outcome of our study is the general conclu-
sion that most of the functions of the factor are carried out by
its largest component, the g-subunit. At least in vitro, the
g-subunit has retained some intrinsic ability to interact with
Met-tRNAi, to bind to the small ribosomal subunits, and to
promote the interaction between Met-tRNAi and the ribosome.
The a-subunit is clearly involved in stabilizing Met-tRNAi
binding, while the function of the small b-subunit remains
elusive at the moment. On the whole, these observations
suggest that the g-subunit functioned as a monomer early in
evolution, preceding the time when the archaeal–eukaryal line
split into two separate domains. This hypothesis agrees with
the fact that the g-subunit of eIF2-like proteins belongs to a
family of tRNA-binding G-proteins that includes the elonga-
tion factor Tu/1-A and its specialized version SELB (29). The
latter is the factor that selects selenocysteine tRNA during the
synthesis of selenoproteins in all primary domains (30–32).
The g-subunit of eukaryal and archaeal IF2 is most closely
related to SELB (29), suggesting that the a/eIF2 g-subunit
arose by gene duplication from elongation factor Tu at about
the same time as SELB. Each of the two proteins became then
specialized for interacting with a single aminoacyl-tRNA spe-
cies, whereas the elongation factor Tu retained the capacity to
bind any aminoacyl-tRNA. Probably, a/eIF2 acquired a select-
ive affinity for Met-tRNAi during the evolution of the common
ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya. However, a/eIF2 must soon
have acquired its present trimeric form, as genes encoding the
a- and b-subunits are found in all archaea, including the
hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans, which has a gen-
ome size of only 0.5 Mb (33).
