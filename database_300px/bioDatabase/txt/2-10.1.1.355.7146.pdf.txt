ABSTRACT
DNA sequence motifs and epigenetic modifications
contribute to specific binding by a transcription
factor, but the extent to which each feature
determines occupancy in vivo is poorly understood.
We addressed this question in erythroid cells by
identifying DNA segments occupied by GATA1 and
measuring the level of trimethylation of histone H3
lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and monomethylation of H3
lysine 4 (H3K4me1) along a 66 Mb region of mouse
chromosome 7. While 91% of the GATA1-occupied
segments contain the consensus binding-site
motif WGATAR, only 0.7% of DNA segments with
such a motif are occupied. Using a discriminative
motif enumeration method, we identified additional
motifs predictive of occupancy given the presence
of WGATAR. The specific motif variant AGATAA
and occurrence of multiple WGATAR motifs are
both strong discriminators. Combining motifs
to pair a WGATAR motif with a binding site motif
for GATA1, EKLF or SP1 improves discriminative
power. Epigenetic modifications are also strong
determinants, with the factor-bound segments
highly enriched for H3K4me1 and depleted of
H3K27me3. Combining primary sequence and
epigenetic determinants captures 52% of the
GATA1-occupied DNA segments and substantially
increases the specificity, to one out of seven
segments with the required motif combination and
epigenetic signals being bound.
INTRODUCTION
A fundamental paradigm in regulation of gene expression
is the binding of a regulatory protein to a speciﬁc DNA
sequence, which then leads to activation or repression by
a variety of mechanisms. The speciﬁc DNA sequence
recognized by a protein is its binding site, which can be
characterized as a motif—either a speciﬁc string or a
position-speciﬁc weight matrix, often a consensus of
sequences at multiple binding sites. The binding sites for
many regulatory proteins have been determined by
sequencing DNA segments with a high aﬃnity for the
protein in solution. Binding-site motifs tend to be quite
short (hexamers are common), and thus they occur
frequently in any long DNA sequence—much more
frequently than speciﬁc occupancy is observed in vivo.
Therefore, an enduring problem is to identify other
determinants of occupancy in vivo (1).
Gene regulation involves transcription factor
interactions with both primary DNA sequence elements
and the chromatin structure of the regions that contain
these elements. In particular, histone modiﬁcations play a
strong role in transcriptional regulation, and are likely to
be signiﬁcant contributors to determining in vivo occu-
pancy. Speciﬁc classes of regulatory elements have been
shown to be accompanied by distinctive histone
modiﬁcations, for example trimethylation of lysine 27 of
histone H3 (H3K27me3) is correlated with repression of
gene expression (2), and monomethylation of lysine 4
of histone H3 (H3K4me1) is associated with enhancers (3).
High throughput methods for mapping the positions of
DNA segments cross-linked to proteins and immunopre-
cipitated from chromatin, namely ChIP-chip and ChIP-
seq (4,5), are used to determine comprehensively the
DNA segments occupied by particular proteins or
having particular chromatin modiﬁcations in vivo. Thus
careful examination of DNA sequences and epigenetic
marks in the occupied segments is expected to reveal the
determinants of occupancy in vivo, show the extent to
which primary sequence can contribute to the speciﬁcity
of occupancy, and explore the ability of histone modiﬁca-
tion in chromatin to explain additional speciﬁcity.

The cis-regulatory modules studied in eukaryotes
consist of binding sites for multiple proteins (6,7), and
thus binding site motifs for other proteins that
commonly co-occupy DNA segments with the protein of
interest are good candidates for determinants of binding
speciﬁcity in addition to the primary binding site motif.
In order to pursue this strategy, the protein of interest
must have an identiﬁable primary binding site that is
present in most of the occupied DNA segments. This is
not always the case, e.g. the cognate consensus motif was
not found in the majority of DNA segments in mamma-
lian cells occupied by transcription factors Sp1, c-Myc and
p53 (8) and E2F1 (9). However, occupancy by the tran-
scription factor GATA1 in vivo is almost invariably
associated with the primary consensus binding-site motif
WGATAR (10). Thus we have chosen to search for addi-
tional discriminative motifs that help determine speciﬁcity
of occupancy by GATA1.
The transcription factor GATA1 is a zinc ﬁnger protein
that is required for normal hematopoiesis and plays a role
in regulating most of the genes that deﬁne the mature
erythroid phenotype (11,12). Early work identiﬁed
WGATAR as the consensus motif bound by GATA1
(13–16). Some (17) but not all (18) investigations using
in vitro site selection assays indicated that GATA1 also
has high aﬃnity for non-consensus motifs in solution.
While directed studies of individual cis-regulatory
modules have shown binding in vitro of GATA1 to
DNA that deviates from the consensus motif (19–21),
other studies ﬁnd the non-consensus motifs to be poor
predictors of enhancer activity (22). Even limiting the
analysis to the consensus binding site motif WGATAR,
only a small fraction of all such motifs are bound in vivo
(23–25).
We searched for other determinants of GATA1 occu-
pancy in vivo by generating a set of 314 DNA segments
that are occupied by GATA1 in the mouse erythroid cell
line G1E-ER4. These were discovered by immunopre-
cipitating DNA fragments associated with GATA1 in
vivo, followed by hybridization to a high-density tiling
array of non-repetitive DNA sequences (ChIP-chip, 4)
along a large segment (66Mb) of mouse chromosome 7.
Randomly sampled ChIP-chip positive regions were
re-tested in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay using inde-
pendent ChIP material, yielding very high validation rates
for GATA1 occupancy. This dataset also provides a large
number of reliably unbound segments to be used for
studies of discriminative features in the sequence.
The motif WGATAR is well known as a primary deter-
minant of binding, occurring in 91% of the bound regions
we discovered. However, the motif alone provides poor
speciﬁcity, as 0.7% of DNA segments that have this
motif are occupied. Thus, we focused on additional
sequence motifs found in DNA segments containing
WGATAR that could distinguish bound from unbound.
We constructed ‘background’ sets of unbound DNA
segments with a distribution of WGATAR motifs and
GC content indistinguishable from the one observed for
the ‘foreground’ (bound) DNA segments. We employed
the computer program Discriminating Matrix
Enumerator, or DME (26), to identify enriched motifs
(represented by scoring matrices) in the foreground set
compared with a series of background sets of unbound
sequences. These over-represented motifs were then
matched to known binding sites for other transcription
factors, and their discriminatory power evaluated both
against an independent testing set and against the bulk
genome. While several discriminatory motifs were
discovered in this way, they did not fully explain the
speciﬁcity of occupancy by GATA1. However, when
histone modiﬁcations around the DNA segments were
examined in addition to motif combinations, the
speciﬁcity of occupancy signiﬁcantly increased from 1
out of 147 segments containing a WGATAR motif to 1
out of 7 segments that have high H3K4me1 signal and
contain the combinations of discriminatory motifs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
GATA1 ChIP-chip and peak calling
A previous study from this laboratory identiﬁed 63 DNA
segments occupied by GATA1 in mouse erythroid cells
(10). That study employed chromatin immunopre-
cipitation (ChIP) by anti-estrogen receptor (anti-ER)
antibody to enrich for DNA segments occupied by the
hybrid GATA1-ER protein in the G1E-ER4 cell line,
24 h after activation of GATA1-ER with estradiol (12).
Peaks of hybridization of this ChIP material to a
NimbleGen high-density array tiling across 66Mb of
mouse chromosome 7 were further tested by large-scale
independent validation using qPCR to identify the 63
high-quality occupied DNA segments (10). In the
current study, we used antibody against the GATA1
portion of the GATA1-ER hybrid protein (Ab GATA-1
N6: sc-265), and hybridized the new ChIP material in
duplicate to the NimbleGen microarray. These new data
showed peaks on the DNA segments previously
demonstrated to be occupied by GATA1, and they had
low signal in the regions where many false positives were
found in the previous study. Thus we applied three peak-
calling programs to the new GATA1 ChIP-chip data
to predict occupied DNA segments: Mpeak (27),
TAMALPAIS (28) and PASS (29). For Mpeak and
TAMALPAIS, application of the most stringent
thresholds (+3SD for Mpeak, L1 for TAMALPAIS)
identiﬁed 238 peaks (union and merge). For PASS, we
allowed one false discovery in the peaks called from the
66Mb region (corresponding to a false discovery rate
of 0.4%), and identiﬁed 90 additional peaks. A 30 kb
segment of mouse chromosome 7 is covered almost
continuously by ChIP hybridization signal rather than
showing the usual discrete peak. The nature of GATA1
binding to this interval is not clear and requires further
study. Thus peaks residing in this 30 kb segment were not
included in the analysis. This left 304 DNA segments con-
taining in vivo binding sites for GATA1 along the 66Mb
locus. These are validated at a very high rate, regardless
of the program used to call them. Of the 304 peaks, 101
were tested independently by qPCR (including the 63
previously published), and 99 (98%) were validated.
The non-validated regions were then removed from the
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 21 7025
dataset, resulting in 302 peaks (listed in Supplementary
Data, Table 1). Some of the larger DNA segments called
as peaks were divided into 500 bp segments to generate
a total of 314 occupied DNA segments.

qPCR validation
Thirty-eight peaks (in addition to the 63 already validated)
were randomly selected from the total of 304 GATA1
peaks in the 66Mb region of mouse chromosome 7.
The enrichment of GATA1 in these regions was tested
by real-time qPCR. The templates examined by qPCR
are GATA1-ChIPed DNA and the ChIP input DNA,
both ampliﬁed twice by GenomePlex Complete Whole
Genome Ampliﬁcation (WGA) Kit. A serial dilution of
the ChIP input DNA was used to build standard curves
for real-time PCR. The abundance of GATA1 on DNA
intervals was measured by the relative enrichment of
GATA1-ChIPed DNA compared with the input DNA.
To control for variation between the several qPCR
experiments needed for the assays, a positive standard
(an occupied segment in the ﬁrst intron of the gene
Zfpm1) and a negative standard (a DNA segment
upstream from Zfpm1) were included in each plate of
samples for qPCR along with the experimental tests and
controls. For each qPCR experiment, the enrichment
levels for the DNA segments were normalized by subtract-
ing the enrichment of the negative standard from the
enrichment on the tested segment and then divided by
the diﬀerence between the enrichment of the positive
standard and the negative standard, using the equation
(SN)/(PN), where S, P and N are the qPCR enrich-
ment values for the tested region, the positive standard
and the negative standard, respectively. Enrichment
levels on intervals from the regions with no peak calls
(negative controls) were tested to build a validation
threshold. The enrichment of GATA1 on these three
negative controls was normalized in the same way as
above. The validation threshold is set to be the mean
plus two standard deviations of the normalized enrich-
ment for the negative control regions.
ChIP-chip analysis of histone modiﬁcations
G1E-ER4 cells were cultured in Iscove’s modiﬁed
Dulbecco’s media (IMDM) with 15% fetal calf serum,
2U/ml erythropoietin and 50 ng/ml kit ligand. Beta-
estradiol (107mol/l) was added to the culture to
activate the G1E-ER4 cells for 24 h.
The ChIP assay was performed as described previously
(10). The antibody against histone H3 trimethylated
on K27 was purchased from Millipore (catalog number
07-449) and the antibody against histone H3
monomethylated on K4 was purchased from Abcam
(catalog number ab8895). The ChIP DNA from induced
G1E-ER4 cells after cross-linking and immunopre-
cipitation by antibody was ampliﬁed using Whole
Genome Ampliﬁcation (WGA) kit from Sigma. The
ampliﬁed DNA was hybridized to the NimbleGen array
16 from the mm6 version of the high-density tiling array,
which covers 69 577 286–133 051 535 position on mouse
chromosome 7 (mm6 assembly). The tiling array
contains 50 bp-long oligonucleotide probes spaced 50 bp
apart (100 bp from the start of one to the start of the
next) in the non-repetitive DNA within the above
genomic region.

2, and ‘H3K27me3 in G1E-ER4 cells, activated’ replicates

Collection of positive and negative regions for
identiﬁcation and evaluation of enriched motifs
We processed the 302 peaks into 314 intervals of 500 bp
each, which covers the amplicons used in qPCR veriﬁca-
tion. These 314 intervals are the foreground set to evaluate
the sequence patterns that might contribute to the in vivo
occupancy of GATA1. This foreground set was randomly
split into two sets of equal size, comprising a foreground
training set (157 intervals) used for the identiﬁcation
of enriched motifs and a foreground testing set (157
intervals) used to evaluate the predictive power of the
identiﬁed motifs. Two genomic features were controlled
in the background datasets of unoccupied DNA
fragments; namely, G+C content and occurrence of
WGATAR motifs. Three background datasets, with
distributions for both G+C content and occurrences of
WGATAR motif very similar to those in the foreground
training set, were randomly selected for use in the identi-
ﬁcation of enriched motifs (background training sets). One
more background set was formed for evaluation of
enriched motifs (background testing set)—its distributions
for G+C content and occurrences of WGATAR were
matched to those in the foreground testing set (Figure 2B).
Identiﬁcation of signiﬁcantly enriched motifs
DME2 (beta version 2008_08_30) was used to identify
enriched motifs of size 6 in the training datasets. DME2
is the beta version of a previously published program
DME (26), which exhaustively searches a ﬁnite space of
possible matrices, and tests the relative overrepresentation
of the matrices in the foreground set compared with the
background. The identiﬁed motifs are not only enriched in
the foreground set but they also have high speciﬁcity
(measured by information content). To ensure the
identiﬁed motifs were robust with respect to the choice
of background, DME was run independently using each
background training set, and motifs identiﬁed in all three
runs were selected. Corresponding motifs between runs
were identiﬁed by high matrix similarity determined
7026 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 21
using matcompare (30) (most had identical consensus
sequences and similar enrichment scores among the three
runs computed by DME2). As expected, almost all the
motifs discovered by this process show a level of sensitivity
and speciﬁcity against the foreground training set that
exceeds that of non-discriminators (Supplementary
Figure S1).
Measuring discriminatory power of motifs
The discriminatory power of each motif (and combination
of motifs) was evaluated in terms of sensitivity and
speciﬁcity. The sensitivity is deﬁned as the fraction of
the 157 occupied intervals in the foreground test set that
contain the motif (or motifs). The speciﬁcity reﬂects the
ability of a classiﬁer to reject unoccupied DNA segments,
and is deﬁned as the fraction of 157 unoccupied segments
in the background test set that do not contain the motif
(or motifs).
Matching words to a library of known transcription
factor binding sites
Enriched motifs were ﬁrst compared with a customized
library composed of scoring matrices from the latest
Jaspar library (31) and two curated scoring matrices for
EKLF and GATA1 binding sites, using the program
matcompare (30). To supplement the motifs in the
Jaspar library, we also applied a string-matching pro-
gram to compare the enriched motifs to the consensus
sequences for known transcription factor binding sites
(TFBSs), using a non-redundant set (32) derived from
TRANSFAC (33), the Jaspar library (31), and custom
consensus sequences for binding sites for three erythroid
transcription factors: EKLF_bs (CCNCACCCW),
GATA1_bs (WGATAR), CP2_bs (CCWG half site).
The program scores exact matches as 1 and mismatches
as 1, and it gives fractional positive scores to matches at
a degenerate position other than N, e.g. matches to a
2-fold degenerate site have a score of 0.5, etc. The TFBS
with the highest match score to a motif is considered the
best match of the motif. This approach produced 14
matches of previously described TFBS motifs to one or
more over-represented motifs (Supplementary Table S6).
Motif matches that violated known rules for critical
positions in a TFBS were then removed by inspection.
For example, the word GTGAGC is a signiﬁcant match
to the consensus binding site GTGGGCGNR for EGR.
However, the nucleotide G at the fourth position is critical
for the binding, so this motif was removed from the list
because it violated this rule.
RESULTS
Binding speciﬁcity of GATA1 along mouse chromosome
7 in erythroid cells
With new GATA1 ChIP-chip data from mouse erythroid
G1E-ER4 cells, we mapped 302 DNA segments occupied
by GATA1 along 66Mb of mouse chromosome 7 (see
‘Materials and Methods’ section). A total of 101
GATA1 peaks were tested independently by qPCR,
including the 63 previously published (10); none of the
false positives from the earlier ChIP-chip data were
peaks in the new data. Of these 101 peaks, 99 (98%)
were validated. Figure 1 shows the qPCR results for 38
GATA1 ChIP-chip peaks not previously tested; all but
two are validated. Importantly, the peak calls that were
uniquely identiﬁed by each of the programs (see ‘Materials
and Methods’ section) are also validated at a high rate,
and thus we pooled all the peak calls into a set of 302
occupied DNA segments.

Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 21 7027
Based on the qPCR validation rate of 98%, we
estimated that 296 segments are occupied by GATA1 in
this 66Mb region. The non-repetitive portion of the
66Mb region on mouse chromosome 7 was divided
into 67 420 intervals of 500 bp each in which a ChIP-
chip peak could be found (the ‘chip-able’ portion, see
Supplementary Data ‘Segmentation of interrogated ChIP
regions into 500 bp windows’). Of these intervals, 43 594
contain at least one WGATAR motif. Thus we estimate
that 296 out of these 43 594 DNA segments are actually
occupied, i.e. 1 in 147 (0.7%). This illustrates the exqui-
site ability of GATA1 to discriminate among available
WGATAR motifs. The fact that 43 298 out of 43 594
DNA segments with potential binding sites are not
occupied indicates that the ChIP data are highly speciﬁc.
Signiﬁcantly enriched motifs in DNA segments
occupied by GATA1
The 302 GATA1-occupied segments were divided into 314
DNA segments of 500 bp; these constitute the foreground
set. Half of these comprise the foreground training set
used to identify sequence patterns that might contribute
to the in vivo occupancy of GATA1 (Figure 2A), and
the other half is used for testing. Almost all (91%)
segments comprising the foreground set contain at least
one instance of the motif WGATAR. Because our goal is

Figure 2. Identiﬁcation and evaluation of motifs enriched in the GATA1-occupied segments. (A) The overall procedure for identifying and testing
motifs enriched in GATA1-occupied segments is illustrated. The 314 DNA intervals of 500 bp that are occupied by GATA1 comprise the foreground
set. It was randomly split into two groups of 157 bound intervals, one used for the identiﬁcation of enriched motifs and the other used for evaluation
of the enriched motifs. Three background training sets and one background testing set were selected. In each run of DME2, the occurrence of all
possible matrices of size 6 was evaluated for over-representation in the foreground training set compared with one of the background training sets.
Motifs that are similar in the over-representation score and matrix composition in the three runs of comparisons using DME2 were combined and
reported as the enriched motifs in the GATA1-occupied segments. These motifs were evaluated for their ability to discriminate occupied segments
from unoccupied ones using the testing datasets. (B) Distribution of G+C content and occurrences of WGATAR motif in the training datasets and
(C) in the testing datasets. The foreground training set and the background training sets have similar G+C content and occurrences of WGATAR
motif; so do the foreground and background testing sets.
7028 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 21
to ﬁnd additional, more speciﬁc, discriminative patterns,
we required DNA intervals in the training and testing
background (unbound) sets to have the same distribution
of WGATAR occurrences as in the foreground sets
(Figure 2B). The background sets were also matched to
the foreground sets in the distribution of G+C content.
DME2 (26) was used to evaluate the over-
representation of motifs in the foreground training set
compared with each of three background training sets
independently (Figure 2A). Twenty-nine motifs were
found in all three runs of DME; these are the discrimina-
tory motifs that are robust to the choice of the back-
ground set (Table 1). These motifs all had similar levels
of enrichment in the foreground compared with each of
the background sets, as given by the enrichment score
(Table 1).
We also analyzed the sequences of the GATA1-
occupied DNA segments using other published motif dis-
covery tools, namely YMF (34), DEME (35), Weeder (36),
MEME (37), AlignACE (38), CLOVER (39). They all
identiﬁed words that match the WGATAR binding site
motif for GATA1, and some also discovered GC-rich
stings (see Supplementary Data, ‘Motifs identiﬁed by
other programs’). However, none returned as many
signiﬁcantly enriched words as DME2 (see ‘Discussion’
section). We also developed a simple discriminative
word-enumeration method that discovered enriched
hexamers similar to many of the motifs discovered by
DME2 (Supplementary Data, ‘Motifs identiﬁed by direct
enumeration of words’).
Discriminatory power of each enriched motif
The eﬀectiveness of each motif discovered by DME2 was
evaluated by calculating its sensitivity and speciﬁcity
against the testing sets of foreground and background
segments (note these are independent sets, i.e. the testing
sets do not overlap with the training sets; Figure 2A
and C). Both the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of enriched
motifs cover wide ranges (Table 1). The discriminatory
performance of the motifs can be visualized in an ROC-
type graph (Figure 3A), in which sensitivity is plotted
against 1-speciﬁcity. An ideal discriminator would
produce a point in the extreme upper left (0,1), while
points along the diagonal reﬂect no discriminatory
power. As shown in Figure 3A, the motifs represented
by the consensus sequences GATAAG and AGATAA
have the best combination of sensitivity and speciﬁcity,
capturing 52–64% of the occupied DNA segments while
rejecting 55–73% of the unbound DNA segments. In
contrast, several of the motifs enriched in the foreground
training set do not discriminate eﬀectively in the testing
sets; these are represented by the black dots to the right of
the diagonal in the ROC graph (Figure 3A), and they have
a light gray background in Table 1. As expected, all 29
motifs discriminate eﬀectively in the training sets
(Supplementary Figure S1); the failure of some to discrim-
inate in the testing sets illustrates the need to use indepen-
dent testing sets for evaluation.
Enriched motifs matching known transcription factor
binding sites
Having found a collection of enriched motifs associated
with GATA1 occupancy (and validated against the testing
set), we searched for matches to known binding sites for
mammalian transcription factors (TFBSs) as compiled in
the Jaspar library (31), in a collection of non-redundant
motifs (32) compiled from the TRANSFAC library (33),
or in a set of custom motifs for binding sites for erythroid
transcription factors, such as EKLF binding sites and CP2
half sites (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). After ﬁl-
tering to remove motif matches that were not consistent
with nucleotides known to be critical for binding
(see ‘Materials and Methods’ section), TFBS motifs for
six families of proteins remained (Table 2). These
include not only GATA1, but also the binding site
motifs for proteins previously demonstrated to interact
with GATA1, such as EKLF, Sp1 and CP2 (40,41) (see
‘Discussion’ section).

same as in the foreground sets. Therefore, we initially were
surprised to ﬁnd a variant of the motif, AGATAA, in the
list of highly enriched motifs that were validated against
the testing set (Table 1). This observation suggested that
this particular variant of the WGATAR motif is preferred
for binding in vivo. Further analysis strongly supports
this conclusion. The AGATAA variant outnumbers the
other three variants of WGATAR in the foreground set,
comprising 40% of all instances of WGATAR. Also, 69%
of the occupied segments contain this motif. In contrast,
AGATAA is less dominant in the unoccupied segments,
comprising 33% of all instances of WGATAR. Only 46%
of the unoccupied segments contain it (Table 3).
The prevalence of variants of WGATAR was also
examined in a dataset compiled from a collection of liter-
ature reports on 36 human and mouse erythroid cis-regu-
latory modules (CRMs) that have been shown to be
bound by GATA1 in vivo by ChIP (see Supplementary
Data, ‘Curated datasets of in vivo occupied segments by
GATA1’ and Supplementary Table S5). None overlap
with our 314 foreground intervals. In these occupied
DNA segments, AGATAA outnumbers the other
variants of WGATAR, comprising 42% of the instances
of WGATAR and occurring in 62% of the occupied
segments or erythroid CRMs (Table 3). In addition,
the variant TGATAA also occurs frequently, comprising
35% of the instances of WGATAR in this dataset
and occurring in 66% of the occupied segments with
a WGATAR (Table 3). These observations indicate that
the two purine nucleotides are not equally preferred in the
sixth position of the motif in vivo, and that WGATAA is a
better consensus than WGATAR for predicting in vivo
occupancy.
Combinations of motifs improve discrimination
Each discriminatory motif with high speciﬁcity but low
sensitivity (producing the black dots in the lower left of
ROC graph in Figure 3A) tends to capture a diﬀerent set
of GATA1-bound DNA segments. Thus evaluating the
union of the intervals containing the discriminatory
motifs is expected to improve discrimination. Therefore
we computed sensitivity and speciﬁcity against the
testing datasets for all combinations of two to four of
the 29 motifs (Figure 3B). In this analysis, sensitivity is
the fraction of bound DNA intervals in the foreground
testing set that contains any one or more of the motifs
in a combination. Speciﬁcity is the fraction of unbound
intervals in the background testing set that contains none
of the motifs in a combination. As expected, the motif
combinations evaluated by this method cover a broad
area of the ROC graph, and the greatest density is in the
higher sensitivity, lower speciﬁcity portion. No discrete
group of motif combinations stands out from the rest,
but rather the better performing combinations are part
of a continuum of discrimination. This indicates that no
small group of motifs is substantially better than others
for distinguishing GATA1-bound from unbound DNA.
While we will focus on the top 10 combinations for
further analysis, it is important to note that many other
combinations are almost equivalently good.
The top 10 motif combinations with the best
performances (colored in red in Figure 3A and B, and
listed in Supplementary Table S7) are all distributed

graph takes the form of a receiveroperator characteristic (ROC) plot.

plot in Figure 3B; in fact, they are better discriminators
than any of the single motifs shown in Figure 3A. Almost
all the top combinations contain at least one match to the
preferred GATA1 binding site motif (e.g. AGATAA,
GATAAG, AAGATA). Another motif occurring fre-
quently in the top combinations is GGGCGG, which is
similar to the binding site motif for SP1 (GGGCGGR).
Thus a particularly eﬀective combination that discrimi-
nates occupied from unoccupied segments is the presence
of any of the three motifs GATAAG, AGATTA, or CCG
CCC, as shown by motif combination B in Figure 3A.
We also evaluated the discriminatory power of the
TFBS motifs that match the enriched motifs discovered
by DME2 (Table 2) and combinations of those TFBSs. As
shown in Figure 3A, no single TFBS motif is an eﬀective
discriminator for GATA1 binding. Because WGATAR is
almost ubiquitous in the foreground testing set (91%) and
is required in the background testing set, it has no discrim-
inatory power and sits right on the diagonal (Figure 3A).
However, two more speciﬁc variants of WGATAR, i.e.
WGATAA and AGATAA, do have some discriminatory
power, achieving some speciﬁcity at the cost of reduced
sensitivity (Figure 3A). No other single TFBS motif has
better discriminatory power; as with the DME2-
discovered motifs, they tend to capture diﬀerent sets of
bound intervals with high speciﬁcity (blue dots in the
lower left in Figure 3A). After pairing a WGATAR
motif with a second motif of either an AGATAA motif
or the TFBS motif for SP1 or the TFBS motif for EKLF,
62% of the occupied DNA segments can be captured, and
57% of the unoccupied DNA segments can be rejected
(dot A in Figure 3A).
Good prediction of occupancy by multiple instances
of WGATAR
Given that multiple motifs can improve discrimination, we
wished to examine how well multiple instances of
WGATAR would predict occupancy. This cannot be
addressed by comparisons to the background training
and testing sets, because these were selected to match
the foreground sets in terms of the distribution of
WGATAR occurrences (Figure 2). Thus we compared
the distribution of WGATAR occurrences in the 314
GATA1-occupied DNA segments with that in all the
67 106 unoccupied DNA segments in the non-repetitive
portion of the interrogated region of chromosome 7.
The average number of instances of the WGATAR
motif is higher in the occupied DNA segments (2.3
compared with 1.1 in the unoccupied DNA segments,
Table 3). Furthermore, the distribution of WGATAR
occurrences per DNA segment is shifted considerably
higher for occupied versus unoccupied DNA segments
(Figure 4). The diﬀerence between the distributions is sig-
niﬁcant by both a Student’s t-test and a Wilcoxon rank
order test (P-values< 2.2 1016). In particular, a much
higher fraction of GATA1-bound DNA intervals has
multiple WGATAR motifs (67%) compared with unoccu-
pied intervals (31%). Thus multiple occurrence of
WGATAR is a feature with strong predictive power.

Biologically, this observation is consistent with the
reported self-association of the GATA1 protein (42,43).
Histone modiﬁcations around GATA1-occupied
DNA segments
Given the strong role played by histone modiﬁcations in
transcriptional regulation, we compared the modiﬁcation
status between GATA1-occupied and unoccupied DNA
segments. Along the 66Mb region of mouse chromosome
7 in G1E-ER4 cells, we measured by ChIP-chip the level
of H3K27me3 (associated with repression of expression)
(2), and H3K4me1 (associated with enhancer activity) (3).
In aggregate, DNA segments in the foreground training
sets are strongly depleted for H3K27me3 for at least 2 kb
on either side of the WGATAR motifs (Figure 5, upper
panel). A small positive signal for H3K27me3 is observed
for the WGATAR motifs in the background training sets.
In striking contrast, the GATA1-occupied segments
comprising the foreground training set (and surrounding
sequences) are strongly enriched for H3K4me1, whereas
the unoccupied segments in the background training sets
show low signals (Figure 5, middle panel). For compari-
son, the aggregated hybridization signal for GATA1
ChIP-chip shows a peak at the WGATAR motif in the
occupied DNA segments but a uniformly low signal
throughout the unoccupied DNA segments (Figure 5,
lower panel). Hybridization signals are low for all three
features around randomly sampled positions in the 66Mb
region of chromosome 7 (Figure 5).
The substantial diﬀerence in histone modiﬁcation status
observed in aggregate in Figure 5 is also observed in indi-
vidual DNA segments. Two examples illustrate the high
level of H3K4me1 and depletion of H3K27me3 in a
GATA1-occupied DNA segment (Figure 6A) and the

opposite pattern in an unoccupied DNA segment
(Figure 6B). While both DNA segments contain four
WGATAR motifs, the presence of a match to an EKLF
binding site motif and characteristic histone modiﬁcations
distinguish the occupied from unoccupied DNA segment.
The histone modiﬁcation status distinctive for occupied
versus unoccupied DNA segments is observed consistently
across the testing datasets. The distribution of mean
H3K27me3 signal is signiﬁcantly lower for the occupied
DNA segments in the foreground testing set compared
with the unoccupied ones in the background testing set
(one tailed Student’s t-test, P-value=4 107, Figure
6C), while the distribution of mean H3K4me1 signal is
signiﬁcantly higher for occupied DNA segments
(Student’s t-test, P-value< 2 1016, Figure 6D).
Histone modiﬁcations provide strong discriminatory power
The dramatic separation between GATA1-occupied and
unoccupied DNA segments for H3K4me1 signal suggests
that it should have strong discriminatory power for occu-
pancy. Based on the distributions shown in Figure 6D,
we partitioned DNA segments into those with a high
average H3K4me1 signal (average hybridization signal
of at least 1) versus those with lower signal. Eighty-
two percent of the GATA1-occupied segments, and only
12% of the unoccupied DNA segments containing
WGATAR motifs, were labeled as high H3K4me1
(Table 4). Indeed, H3K4me1 is the best single discrimina-
tory feature examined in this study; sensitivity and
speciﬁcity for this feature on the testing foreground and
background sets are compared with those for other
features in Figure 3 (dot D). The level of H3K27me3
signal (partitioning DNA segments into two classes,
those with a mean signal <0 and those with a mean
signal of at least 0, chosen to obtain good separation
based on the distributions shown in Figure 6C) provides
a discriminatory power comparable to the primary
sequence motifs (dot C in Figure 3). These associations
are also observed when the chromosome was segmented
based on histone modiﬁcation status by applying
hidden Markov model approaches, which are not depen-
dent on an arbitrary threshold (Supplementary Data,

Combination of primary sequence motifs and epigenetic
signals best predict in vivo GATA1 occupancy
Having used the training and testing datasets to ﬁnd
sequence motifs and histone modiﬁcations with discrimi-
natory power, we then assessed their ability to determine
occupancy by GATA1 in erythroid cells along mouse
chromosome 7 (Table 5, Figure 7). In the 66Mb-region,
there are more than 179 000 matches to the canonical
GATA1 binding site motif WGATAR, with 78 000
matches located in the non-repetitive portion interrogated
by ChIP-chip. The discriminatory ability of features was
examined in DNA intervals with sizes comparable to those
of the ChIP-chip peak calls (about 500 bp each). The
DNA from the chip-able regions was divided into 67 420
intervals (Set 1 in Table 5, of which 43 594 contain at least
one WGATAR motif (Set 2). This has almost all the DNA
intervals occupied by GATA1 (288 of the 314), but of
course the vast majority of such intervals are not
occupied (Figure 7, upper graph). Thus the positive
predictive value (PPV) of a WGATAR motif is quite
low. Requiring additional TFBS motifs reduces the
number of occupied segments captured (sensitivity,
middle graph in Figure 7), but the reduction in total
number of intervals is greater (lower graph in Figure 7)
so that the fraction of intervals bound by GATA1
increases (upper graph in Figure 7). Allowing any from
a combination of motifs substantially increases the
number of occupied segments captured, with only a
small reduction in the PPV.
Requiring a low level of H3K27me3 captures even more
occupied segments than does combinations of motifs, but
the fraction of intervals occupied is quite low. Requiring a
high level of H3K4me1 is very eﬀective, with sensitivity
better than any combination of motifs and a PPV substan-
tially higher than any other feature. Requiring both
epigenetic marks further improves the PPV, but with
some loss of sensitivity. This trend is even more pro-
nounced when both diagnostic epigenetic marks and a
motif combination are required (green bars in Figure 7).
The best balance of PPV and sensitivity is obtained with
H3K4me1 and motif combinations. The 1669 segments
meeting these criteria captured 162 occupied segments
(Sensitivity=0.52, Set 15 in Table 5). This set of DNA
segments gives one true occupied segment in about 10 false
positives. Requiring both histone modiﬁcation states (high
H3K4me1 and low H3K27me3) along with combinations
of motifs (Set 18) returns a set of DNA fragments of which
15% are occupied. This corresponds to one in seven
intervals being occupied, which is a substantial improve-
ment over one in 147 intervals with a WGATAR being
occupied.
DISCUSSION
Primary sequence determinants of occupancy by GATA1
The protein GATA1 has a high aﬃnity in solution for
sequences containing the motif WGATAR, but previous
studies left it unclear whether this was true for segments
occupied in vivo. Our results show that the WGATAR
motif is signiﬁcantly associated with occupancy: 91% of
the occupied segments have the motif and unoccupied
segments have substantially fewer of these motifs. Many
mutagenesis studies have also shown the importance of the
WGATAR motif for regulated expression of reporter
genes (13,22,23,42–44). These results, combined with the
in vitro aﬃnity and our demonstration of the motifs in the
preponderance of segments occupied in vivo, make a
strong case for the WGATAR motif as a critical determi-
nant of in vivo binding by GATA1. Furthermore,
our studies show that two variants of this motif,
AGATAA and TGATAA, are more frequently found in

windows in the non-repetitive portion of the 66Mb locus (see
‘Materials and Methods’ section). The intervals that have one or
more matches to the GATA1_bs are set 2. Intervals were then
searched for those with matches to the additional binding site motifs
that gave the best discrimination (sets 3–8, Figure 3). Intervals that
have low signals of H3K27 tri-methylation are set 11, and intervals
that have high signals of H3k4 mono-methylation are set 12. Various
combinations of motifs and histone modiﬁcations (sets 9–10, 14–19)
were also evaluated for their discriminative power.
aMotif 1 is a composite motif of pairing GATA1_bs with a second
binding site motif of GATA1, EKLF or SP1.
bMotif 2 is a composite motif of pairing GATA1_bs with a second
binding site motif of GATA1, EKLF, SP1, CP2 or GABP.
cEpiMark means a region with both low H3K27me3 and high
H3K4me1 signals.
dH3K4me1 means high H3K4me1 signals.

the in vivo bound segments than are the motif variants that
end in G.
However, the presence of the WGATAR motif is not
suﬃcient to determine occupancy by GATA1 in erythroid
cells. In G1E-ER4 cells, only about one in 147 DNA
segments on chromosome 7 that potentially could be
occupied actually are bound by GATA1 in vivo. Some of
the other DNA segments may be occupied by GATA1 in
myeloid lineages, not in erythroid cells, presumably
regulating genes that are speciﬁcally activated or repressed
by GATA1 in those other cell types. Thus some of the
speciﬁcity could be determined by combinatorial actions
of diﬀerent transcription factors with GATA1. Our inves-
tigation of motifs associated with occupancy supports this
model. Some of the most frequently occurring motifs are
good matches for the half-site for binding CP2, which has
been shown to participate with GATA1 in regulation by
multiple erythroid CRMs (40). Other enriched motifs
match to the binding sites for either Sp1 or EKLF.
These are Kru¨ppel-like zinc ﬁnger proteins that have
been shown to interact with GATA1 and to play impor-
tant roles in erythroid regulation (41).
Another major determinant of occupancy by GATA1 is
the presence of multiple WGATAR motifs. This suggests
that multiple molecules of GATA1 may be bound to such
segments in vivo. GATA1 is known to self-associate
through its zinc ﬁnger domains (45), and a mutant
GATA1 defective in self-association activity can only par-
tially rescue the Gata10.5 mutant mouse (46). This
shows that the speciﬁc interaction of multiple GATA1
protein molecules is needed for the regulatory activity
of GATA1. The fact that most of the occupied segments
also have multiple binding motifs suggests that this
self-association in vivo may be driven both by multiple
binding sites and speciﬁc protein-protein interaction
domains.

Figure 7. Ability of primary sequence and epigenetic signals to determine occupancy of DNA by GATA1. Beginning with the 67 420 DNA segments
of length 500 bp in the non-repetitive portion of the 66Mb region of mouse chromosome 7, groups of DNA segments having the feature(s) listed
along the x-axis were examined for the fraction of the DNA segments bound by GATA1 (top panel), the number of GATA1-occupied DNA
segments (GATA1os) captured within the group (middle panel; maximum is 314), and the total number of DNA segments in the group (bottom
panel). The features are binding site motifs recognized by transcription factors (labeled GATA1_bs, e.g.) and combinations of motifs (red bars),
histone modiﬁcations (blue bars), and combinations of histone modiﬁcations and motifs (green bars).

Epigenetic determinants of occupancy by GATA1
Combinations of WGATAR with other TFBS motifs can
achieve an improvement in accuracy of determining
GATA1 occupancy in vivo. Combinations of motifs can
restrict the potential targets to one true occupied segment
in 75 segments with combinations of the discriminatory
motifs identiﬁed in this study (Table 5, set 9). In order
to ﬁnd additional signals that allow the protein GATA1
to distinguish the one real binding site among the 75 with
multiple motifs, we examined histone modiﬁcations
in chromatin. It is possible that the majority of the
GATA1-occupied DNA segments are in regions of the
chromosome that are active in erythroid cells. If so, then
these regions may be in an accessible chromatin confor-
mation, and one would expect to ﬁnd chromatin marks
associated with open chromatin in these regions. Our
studies conﬁrm this.
Mono-methylation of H3K4 is known to be associated
with enhancers and open chromatin (3). We ﬁnd that this
is the feature with the strongest discriminatory power of
any single feature we have examined. In contrast to the
GATA1 occupancy signals that are centered and most
enriched right at the WGATAR motifs in the occupied
segments (Figure 6, lower panel), signals of histone
modiﬁcations cover a larger region (at least 2000 bp
away from the centered position). One interpretation of
these data is that a small set of DNA segments are marked
by histone modiﬁcations that directly or indirectly facili-
tate binding of sequence-speciﬁc binding proteins such
as GATA1 to DNA. These chromatin marks may be in
place early in a diﬀerentiating cell lineage. In future
experiments, it will be informative to examine the
histone modiﬁcation status of chromatin in G1E cells
prior to restoration and activation of GATA1. Some of
the DNA in the H3K4me1 regions may have that status
prior to restoration of the transcription factor. This would
support a role for the epigenetic marks in directing the
selective binding of GATA1.
We note that one contributor to the eﬀective discrimi-
nation by H3K4me1 is the large number of DNA
segments occupied by GATA1. Other transcription
factors that bind much less frequently may not show this
discriminatory power of histone modiﬁcation because a
smaller fraction of the modiﬁed segments will be occupied.
Comparison with other enumeration-based motif
discovery tools
The challenge in using enumeration methods for motif
discovery is to adequately evaluate the signiﬁcance of
the enrichments obtained after the enumeration process.
The enrichments are computed based on motif frequencies
in a foreground set compared with some background set.
DME2 (26) enumerates all possible score matrices of
a pre-deﬁned length in both a foreground and a back-
ground dataset and then optimizes the over-representation
score, but it makes no assumptions about the background
distributions. In contrast, several other enumeration-
based methods compare the observed frequencies with
those predicted by theoretical distributions, such as
hypergeometric (47) or binomial (48). The YMF
program (34) enumerates all possible words up to a
certain length and compares the observed occurrences
with simulations of background sequences based on
Markov models. While these approaches have merit,
their utility may be limited by how well the chosen
distributions ﬁt the real background.
Another positive feature of DME is the ﬂexibility in
choosing background sets for ﬁnding discriminatory
motifs. Almost all the segments occupied by GATA1
have the consensus motif WGATAR, and this motif is
common in the bulk genomic DNA segments. Thus we
customized our used of DME by requiring background
DNA segments not only to be unoccupied, but also to
contain this primary motif. This approach facilitates the
discovery of additional motifs. Using the DME pipeline,
we found 19 motifs with signiﬁcant discriminatory power
that were also validated against a testing set. Furthermore,
many of them matched binding sites for transcription
factors previously implicated in working with GATA1 in
regulating gene expression. Many of the other methods we
used, whether enumeration-based or probabilistic, only
used the foreground set of intervals, and invariably these
returned many fewer discriminatory motifs. Thus the
ability to input user-deﬁned foreground and background
datasets is an advantage in motif discovery.
Novel patterns
About half of the enriched, validated motifs do not match
to a known transcription factor binding-site in our
compiled library. The lack of a TFBS match may reﬂect
the limitation of current knowledge on TFBSs, or the
enriched motifs may be derived from functional
sequence patterns other than binding sites, for example,
partial sequences of microRNAs. Further investigation of
these novel motifs could lead to new insights into
determinants of speciﬁcity of GATA1 occupancy (e.g.
binding site motifs for a protein that co-binds with
GATA1) and mechanisms of GATA1-dependent regula-
tion of gene expression.
