ABSTRACT
The generation of microarray probes with specificity
below the species level is an ongoing challenge,
not least because the high-throughput detection of
microorganisms would be an efficient means of iden-
tifying environmentally relevant microbes. Here, we
describe how suppression subtractive hybridization
(SSH) can be applied to the production of microarray
probes that are useful for microbial differentiation at
the subspecies level. SSH was used to initially iso-
late unique genomic sequences of nine Salmonella
strains, and these were validated in quadruplicate
by microarray analysis. The results obtained indicate
that a large group of genes subtracted by SSH could
serve together, as one probe, for detecting a microbial
subspecies. Similarly, the whole microbial genome
(not subjected to SSH) can be used as a species-
specific probe. The detailed methods described here-
in could be used and adapted for the estimation of
any cultivable bacteria from different environments.
INTRODUCTION
Microarrays are powerful tools for the parallel, high-
throughput detection and quantification of nucleic acids (1).
Currently, DNA microarrays, in particular, are broadly applied
across most sectors of the life sciences, including environ-
mental microbiology and microbial ecology and human, vet-
erinary, food and plant diagnostics (2,3). While there is
abundant opportunity to use DNA microarray technology to
identify microorganisms, several practical limitations have
slowed the implementation of this methodology (4). These
include low sensitivity and poor resolution at the species
and subspecies level. For the potential of DNA microarrays
to be realized, these long-term methodological obstacles must
be overcome. Because species-level resolution does not neces-
sarily provide sufficient information for diagnosis, there is a
need for subspecies-level genetic resolution markers in both
clinical and environmental microbiology (1). In this study, sets
of genes produced by suppression subtractive hybridization
(SSH) were tested as subspecies-specific microarray probes
for discriminating several strains that are closely related
phylogenetically.
SSH is a widely used method for separating DNA sequences
that distinguish two closely related genomic DNA (gDNA)
libraries (5–8). A key feature of the method is simultaneous
normalization and subtraction steps. The normalization step
equalizes the abundance of DNA fragments within the target
population, and the subtraction step excludes sequences
that are common to the two populations being compared
(7). Specific amplification of genes with SSH has allowed
identification of minute genomic differences between closely
related microbial strains (9–13) and enabled the profiling of
genetic diversity in an environmental metagenome (14).
Although there have been several studies applying tester-
specific genes as microarray probes (15–17), they all used a
single clone as an individual probe because their microarray
was constructed for analysis of genome-wide differential gene
expression. Recently, using nylon membrane-based macroar-
ray hybridization, Li et al. (18) demonstrated that gene frag-
ments produced by SSH could be used as a species-specific
probe for the diagnosis of five species of the genus
Dendrobrium. While that study provided valuable insights

into gDNA subtraction between different species, we suggest
that their approach may actually be subspecies-specific, given
that the gDNA probes were absolutely species-specific in the
reverse sample genome probing (RSGP) hybridization (19). In
addition, while those authors reported that only 12.16% of
SSH clones were species-specific, it is generally recognized
that all fragments from SSH are absolutely tester-specific (14).
In this study, therefore, SSH-amplified genes that are specific
to a microbial strain were not separated into individual frag-
ments by cloning. Rather, the sum of amplified genes was
applied together as one microarray probe, which was used
to specifically detect the individual strain. The diagnostic
specificity of these microarray probes was evaluated by
typing nine Salmonella type strains that are phylogenetically
closely related and by comparing them to gDNA probes.
For more accurate and precise analysis, miniaturized micro-
arrays with guaranteed high reproducibility (20) were con-
structed by depositing DNA probes onto non-porous
substrates with printing robots. The underlying rationale
of SSH-microarray hybridization is discussed from a phylo-
genomic perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and preparation of gDNA
Nine Salmonella type strains plus an Escherichia coli type
strain were used in this study, as detailed in Table 1. They
were obtained from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures
(KCTC), the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures (DSMZ) and the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). All strains were maintained and grown under con-
ditions suggested by the collection from which they were
sourced. Cells at the exponential growth phase were quickly
harvested and frozen at80C for the extraction of DNA. The
gDNAs were isolated using a bead-beating method, as previ-
ously described (21). All DNA samples were treated with
RNase A (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and were analyzed on agarose
gels stained with ethidium bromide prior to SSH, microarray
fabrication and hybridization. Concentrations of the obtained
DNAs were determined in triplicate using a spectrophotometer
(Nanodrop Technologies, Rockland, DE).
Suppressive subtractive hybridization
SSH was used to isolate DNA fragments present in the
target microbial organisms but absent from the reference
strains. The procedure was performed using the PCR-Select
Bacterial Genome Subtraction Kit (Clontech), with minor
modifications. Salmonella choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis
(Type species) was assigned as the SSH driver while the
other eight strains were assigned as SSH testers. For SSH
of S.choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis, Salmonella typh-
imurium, which has the most similar 16S rRNA sequence,
was assigned as a driver. Tester and driver samples were
digested separately with RsaI. Adaptor ligations using the
Clontech kit were performed as recommended in the user
manual. Ligation efficiency was analyzed also as described
in the manual with the bacterial 1088r primer (22). PCR amp-
lification of tester-specific fragments was performed using
primers directed to tester ligated adaptor sequences. The
AccuPower PCR PreMix (Bioneer, Korea) and a Peltier
Thermal Cycler (DNA Engine DYAD, MJ Research)
were used for both primary and secondary PCR amplifications.
Both PCR amplifications were performed using the primers
and recommended primer and template concentrations from
the Clontech kit, adjusted to a total volume of 50 ml. The
primary PCR cycling conditions were as follows: one incuba-
tion of 94C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94C for 10 s,
66C for 30 s and 72C for 1.5 min. Secondary PCR cycling
involved a similar program, but used an annealing temperature
of 68C. Five replicates of each secondary PCR product
(250 ml) were purified using the AccuPrep PCR Purification
Kit (Bioneer, Korea).
Microarray construction, labeling and hybridization
Microarray construction, post-treatment, labeling and hybrid-
ization were performed as described previously (23) with
minor modifications. The gDNAs and genes specifically amp-
lified by SSH were diluted to a final concentration of 400 ng/ml
in 0.1· TE. Five microliters aliquots of each probe were trans-
ferred to a 384-well microplate and mixed with 5 ml of 2·
microarray spotting solution (ArrayIt, Telechem Interna-
tional, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) for printing. Each probe set was
printed in quadruplicate. The exact location of each gDNA
on the glass slide is listed in Table 1. After post-treatments

including cross-linking, blocking, heat-denaturing (immersing
in dH2O at 95
C for 2 min), rinsing in 95% ethanol and air-
drying, microarrays were stored dry in a clean slide box at
room temperature. DNA was labeled with the BioPrime DNA
Labeling System and 2.5 mM Cy5 dCTP (Amersham Phar-
macia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) by incubating at 37C for 3 h.
The labeled target DNA was purified using a QIAquick PCR
purification column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), concentrated in a
Speedvac for 1 h, and resuspended in 4.35 ml of dH2O for
hybridization. All microarray hybridizations were performed
in triplicate (a total of 12 replicates per DNA probe), unless
otherwise noted, to facilitate statistical analyses. After hybrid-
ization, each microarray slide was taken out and its cover slip
was immediately removed under wash solution 1 (1· SSC and
0.2% SDS). Slides were washed using wash solution 1, wash
solution 2 (0.1· SSC and 0.2% SDS), and wash solution 3
(0.1· SSC) for 5 min each, at ambient temperature prior to
drying. The slide was dried by centrifugation, as described
above.
Microarray scanning and data analysis
A GenePix 4000B microarray scanner set (Axon instru-
ments, Union City, CA) was used for scanning the microarrays
at a resolution of 10 mm. For consistent scanning of all hybrid-
ized slides, the laser power and photomultiplier tube (PMT)
gain were adjusted to 100%. Scanned image displays were
analyzed by quantifying the pixel density (intensity) of each
hybridization spot using the GenePix software program (ver-
sion 4.0; Axon instruments). Hybridization images presented
here are representative images, which were automatically
contrast-adjusted by the software. A grid of individual circles
defining the location of each DNA spot on the array was
superimposed onto the image to indicate each quantified fluor-
escent spot. Mean signal intensity was automatically determ-
ined for each spot. The local background signal was also
automatically subtracted from the hybridization signal of
each individual spot. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for
each spot was calculated based on following formula (24):
SNR ¼ (signal intensity  background)/SD of background,
in which the ‘background’ measurement refers to the local
spot background intensity and the ‘SD of background’ was
calculated across all pixels, as measured by the GenePix
software. Statistical analysis was performed using Excel
2003 (Microsoft) and Sigmaplot 8.0 (Jandel Scientific, San
Rafael, CA). The SNRs from 12 replicate data sets were
then averaged to obtain the SNR value of each individual
probe. Relative SNRs were obtained by dividing the average
SNR value by the mean value of the hybridized template SNR
in the same microarray slide.
Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Salmonella
16S rDNA isolated from each Salmonella strain was amplified
by PCR using two universal primers as described by Yoon et al.
(25) and sequenced as described by Yoon et al. (26). Multiple
alignments were performed using the Clustal X program (27).
The evolutionary distances were calculated using the Jukes &
Cantor method. The phylogenic tree was constructed using a
neighbor-joining method (28) in the MEGA 2 program (29).
To compare similarities, a 16S rRNA homology matrix was
constructed using PairProWin.exe (http://microarray.kaist.ac.
kr) software, which is based on the Clustal W program.
RESULTS
Phylogenetic analysis on the genus Salmonella
Currently, the valid names of species and subspecies in
the genus Salmonella are as follows: S.choleraesuis (subsp.
choleraesuis, salamae, arizonae, diarizonae, hountenae, and
indica), S.enteritidis, S.typhimurium, Salmonella typhi and
Salmonella bongori (30). Although Salmonella enteritidis,
S.typhimurium and S.typhi are almost genetically identical
to S.choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis (31–33), these species
continue to appear in the approved lists and retain their unique
nomenclatural because they are now very important human
pathogens. In this study, the type strains of S.enteritidis,
S.typhimurium, S.bongori and six subspecies (serovars) of
S.choleraesuis were selected to determine whether SSH-
generated microarray probes are specific at a subspecies
level. To confirm the identity of these strains and to prelim-
inarily investigate phylogenetic relationships within the genus
Salmonella, 16S rDNA was sequenced for each strain, sub-
jected to BLAST searching (34) and inter-strain comparisons
were conducted. This 16S rDNA gene-based phylogeny
revealed that the Salmonella type strains used in this study
are very closely related with all species and subspecies, except
S.bongori, sharing >98% 16S rDNA sequence similarity.
S.bongori had 97.2–98.0% sequence identity with the other
Salmonella type strains while E.coli, which was used as an
experimental control and an out-group in the phylogenetic
tree, had 96.7–97.9% similarity with Salmonella. The 16S
rDNA distances between the Salmonella strains used in this
study are plotted in Figure 1.
SSH of gDNA from Salmonella species and subspecies
SSH was carried out between the type strains of the nine
Salmonella species and subspecies to determine the usefulness
of this technique for isolating DNA unique to a Salmonella
subspecies. S.choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis (type species
of the genus) was assigned as the SSH driver while the other
eight strains were assigned as SSH testers. Based on 16S rRNA
homology comparison, the nearest phylogenetic neighbor,
S.typhimurium, was assigned as the driver for S.choleraesuis
subsp. choleraesuis (Figure 1). Most tester and driver samples
were between 100 and 1500 bp in size when digested with RsaI
(Figure 2A). Analysis of ligation efficiency, which was con-
ducted by PCR amplification with the bacterial 1088r primer,
produced a dim band of 280 bp in size. This corresponded to
the fragment size predicted on the basis of the priming and
RsaI-cutting sites in the Salmonella 16S rRNA sequence
(Figure 2B). After twice hybridization between testers and
drivers, primary PCR and secondary nested PCR of tester-
specific fragments were executed. Although the apparent
intensity and size of ethidium bromide-stained primary pro-
ducts were similar for all tester species/subspecies, the size of
secondary nested PCR products varied significantly between
testers (Figure 2C and D). Concentrations of the purified sec-
ondary PCR products (50 ml) were in the range 62–119 ng/ml.
PAGE 3 OF 8 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 13 e113
These products were further concentrated and used as probes
for SSH microarrays.
Specificity of SSH microarrays
To obtain proof of principle, the specificity of SSH microar-
rays was evaluated by hybridizing them with the gDNA of
each Salmonella type strain. As predicted, strong signals were
only obtained for the probes corresponding to the labeled
target (lower lines in Figure 3). Little or no cross-
hybridization (0–4%) of SNRs was observed for non-target
species and subspecies, indicating that, at least under the con-
ditions applied here, strain-specific hybridization is achieved
with SSH microarrays. In order to compare the specificity of
SSH probes to intact genome probes, gDNA extracted from
each genus Salmonella strain was also spotted on the same
slide (upper lines in Figure 3). In the Salmonella gDNA
hybridization, cross-hybridizations ranging from 1 to 92% of
(SNRs) were observed between the target subspecies and its
phylogenetic neighbor subspecies. Different species such as
S.bongori and E.coli were clearly distinguished by genomic
hybridization whereas almost identical species, such as S.typh-
imurium and S.enteritidis, could not be differentiated from
S.choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis (31). This indicated that
strain or subspecies differentiation could not be achieved in
gDNA-based hybridization, in contrast to the SSH probes, all
of which were perfectly specific for their corresponding tar-
gets. Regarding cross-hybridization of gDNA probes, there
was a clear trend for higher cross-hybridization SNR values
among subspecies with close 16S rDNA homology (Figures 1
and 4). This strongly suggests that genomic hybridization on a
microarray slide is very useful for estimating bacterial simil-
arity, below the species level, for closely related strains.
Since real environments are generally composed of a variety
of different microorganisms, evaluation of SSH probes with
mixed genomes may enhance the applicability of SSH
microarrays. To determine whether other non-target DNA
interferes with the specificity of SSH microarray-based
hybridization, three different gDNAs (500 ng per species)
from S.choleraesuis subsp. indica, hountenae and diarizonae
were mixed, labeled, and hybridized to the SSH microarray
(J in Figure 3). Specific hybridization signals were observed
for the corresponding probes, with these exhibiting similar
SNRs of 286.3, 292.8 and 309.4, respectively. On the contrary,
the non-target probes had SNRs below the background level.
These results suggest that SSH probes could also be specific
in the presence of other genomes and strongly validate the
hypothesis that the subtracted genome only contains tester-
specific genes.
DISCUSSION
Salmonella is one of the major bacterial agents that cause
foodborne infections in humans worldwide (35). Members
of the genus Salmonella have been divided into >2300 sero-
vars (32) and their classification has provoked many argu-
ments between microbiologists (30). The extraordinarily
close inter-genomic relationships that exist between Salmon-
ella species present a major problem for prohibiting their
phylogeny from being unshakable (36). Since the major epi-
demiological markers of Salmonella strains are subspecies and
serovars, which are determined by chromosomal genes and are
not affected by extrachromosomal elements (37), high-
throughput detection of Salmonella below the species level
is crucial for studying human infections in detail. Existing
methods for the molecular typing of Salmonella include plas-
mid typing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, ribotyping and
random-amplified polymorphic DNA analyses (38). However,
the ever-increasing availability of genome sequences for these
microorganisms implies that genotypic methods that are
amenable to automation will be developed in time. In this

regard it is plausible that DNA microarrays will be developed
with specific probes for thousands of different microbial
species or strains, enabling fast and reliable identification of
microorganisms (39). Most previous Salmonella microarrays
have been manufactured for the purpose of studying genetic
relationships between Salmonella and/or other close relatives
(40). Although a few 16S rRNA gene-based microarrays have
been developed for high-throughput diagnosis of bacterial

pathogens including Salmonella (41,42), so far these have
exhibited poor resolution at the species level as well as prob-
lems in detection sensitivity (43,44).
In this study, we differentiated seven subspecies of Salmon-
ella using SSH-generated microarray probes. Their ability to
distinguish S.enteritidis and S.typhimurium from the almost
genetically identical organism, S.choleraesuis subsp. choler-
aesuis (and vice versa), indicated that SSH probes are strain-
specific. Importantly, this specificity was also maintained in a
mixed genome hybridization test. These results indicate that
the generation and application of microarray probes with SSH
may be useful for monitoring various microorganisms in real
environments. Although Li et al. (18) reported that only
12.16% of SSH clones were species-specific, all the SSH
fragments in this study were found to be absolutely tester-
specific since no cross-hybridization was observed, even
between almost identical strains. The high degree of specificity
of SSH probes was not surprising, given that gDNA probes
were also absolutely species-specific—an observation consist-
ent with previous findings for RSGP hybridization (19).
Subtracting the tester genome with a driver genome is not an
ideal approach for the construction of strain-specific probes,
since it is possible that the remaining tester strain gDNA could
still contain the genes similar to those of a third unknown
organism. The potential paucity of SSH microarrays could
be addressed by selecting the most closely related strain as
a SSH driver for each test strain and using a nested probe
approach such that probes of different taxonomic levels,
such as gDNA, are combined to increase the confidence of
the assay.
The use of microbial diagnostic microarrays is expected to
accelerate our understanding of previously unrecognized com-
plex microbial processes (2). However, high resolution
microarray analysis techniques must also be developed on a
high-throughput basis. This will provide a significant advance
over current techniques since for many organisms, even
Figure 3. Fluorescence images showing hybridization specificity of gDNA and SSH probes. All gene probes were printed in quadruplicate (divided with white dotted
lines). Microbial gDNAs were printed in the first row (gDNA), and SSH probes in the second row (SSH). Location of probes in the microarray is shown in Table 1.
Each microarray was hybridized with 500 ng of Salmonella gDNA (see yellow indications on each image and Table 1), except the 3 mix. The microarray indicated as J
(yellow indication) was hybridized with 500 ng of equally mixed gDNAs of S.choleraesuis subsp. indica (A), S.choleraesuis subsp. hountenae (E) and S.choleraesuis
subsp. diarizonae (I).
e113 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 13 PAGE 6 OF 8
species-level differentiation is difficult to achieve (1). The
specificity of SSH probes observed in this study could clearly
solve the existing methodological problems associated with
microarrays. The ability to conduct such high resolution ana-
lyses has important implications across diverse areas including
the monitoring of inoculated strains in bioreactors or the lactic
acid bacteria used as a probiotics in gastrointestinal microflora,
as well as the diagnosis of closely related microorganisms such
as Salmonella.
