ABSTRACT
mRNA pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in
programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting (1 PRF).
Though we previously presented a model for how
mRNA pseudoknots might activate the mechanism
for 1 PRF, it did not address the question of the
role that they may play in positioning the mRNA
relative to the ribosome in this process [E. P. Plant,
K. L. M. Jacobs, J. W. Harger, A. Meskauskas,
J. L. Jacobs, J. L. Baxter, A. N. Petrov and
J. D. Dinman (2003) RNA, 9, 168–174]. A separate
‘torsional restraint’ model suggests that mRNA pseu-
doknots act to increase the fraction of ribosomes dir-
ected to pause with the upstream heptameric slippery
site positioned at the ribosome’s A- and P-decoding
sites [J. D. Dinman (1995) Yeast, 11, 1115–1127]. Here,
experiments using a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknots’
having different degrees of rotational freedom were
used to test this model. The results of this study sup-
port the mechanistic hypothesis that 1 ribosomal
frameshifting is enhanced by torsional resistance of
the mRNA pseudoknot.
INTRODUCTION
The structure of an RNA molecule is widely recognized to
play a role in many processes, including structurally organiz-
ing complex RNAs, the assembly of ribonucleoprotein com-
plexes, and in translational recoding and regulation [reviewed
in (1)]. One common RNA folding motifs is a pseudoknot, the
folding back of a single-stranded RNA onto itself to form two
helical structures with single-stranded loops joining them (2).
Many such structures can be inferred from RNA sequences
and frameshifting function has been demonstrated for some of
these [reviewed in (3–5)]. However, though much theoretical
progress has been made in understanding how mRNA pseu-
doknots promote efficient 1 ribosomal frameshifting (6),
a complete understanding of this mechanism remains
untested.
Programmed 1 ribosomal frameshift signals are typically
divided into three components. From 50 to 30 these are (i) a
‘slippery site’ in the form N NNW WWH, where N must be a
stretch of any three identical nucleotides, where W is either
three A or U residues, and H is A, C or U (spacing indicates the
unshifted zero frame), (ii) a spacer region and (iii) an mRNA
structural element, most often a pseudoknot. The general
model posits that upon encountering the mRNA pseudoknot,
an elongating ribosome is forced to pause such that the anti-
codons of its A- and P-site tRNAs are base-paired with the
zero-frame codons of the slippery site. The nature of the
tRNA–mRNA interactions is such that a relative slip of 1
nucleotide still allows base-pairing in the non-wobble posi-
tions. The slippage occurs during the ribosomal pause, and it
has been shown that changes affecting ribosome pause times
affect frameshift efficiencies [reviewed in (7)]. An important
observation is that even though mRNA pseudoknots and
energetically equivalent stem–loop structures appear to pro-
mote ribosome pausing with equal effectiveness, mRNA pseu-
doknots are more efficient at promoting 1 PRF (8). Our ‘9 A˚’
model (6) provided a refinement of the original ‘simultaneous
slippage’ (9,10) model of frameshifting by suggesting that
rather than the entire ribosome having to slip one base in
the 50 direction, slippage could be accomplished by moving
the small section of mRNA in the downstream tunnel by one
base in the 30 direction. We have proposed that this is accomp-
lished by the bulky and difficult to unwind mRNA pseudoknot
structures becoming wedged in the downstream entrance tun-
nel of the ribosome, preventing the downstream region of the
mRNA from being pulled into the ribosome by the equivalent
of one base during the accommodation step of elongation. This
blockage would introduce tension into the spacer region,
which could be resolved by unpairing the mRNA from the
tRNAs, allowing the mRNA to slip 1 nt backwards, resulting
in a net shift of reading frame by 1 base.
Though the 9 A˚ model provides a partial explanation for
why mRNA pseudoknots promote programmed 1 ribo-
somal frameshifting (1 PRF) more efficiently than simple

stem–loop structures, it does not answer the question of how
the mRNA pseudoknot directs the ribosome to pause at the
correct position along the mRNA. A complementary ‘torsional
restraint’ model addresses this issue (11). When a stem–loop
structure is unwound by an elongating ribosome, unwinding of
the stem forces the loop to rotate. Since a simple stem–loop is
not restrained, the loop can rotate freely and only the base pairs
within the stem resist ribosomal movement, and thus the
potential energy of unwinding should be distributed along the
length of Stem 1 (Figure 1A). However, if the loop is anchored
or restrained, as it is in a pseudoknot by Stem 2, since the
intrinsic ribosomal helicase is processive (12), Stem 1 cannot
be fully unwound until Stem 2 is first denatured. Mechanically,
as the ribosome begins to unwind the base of Stem 1, Stem 2
forces the supercoiling in the remainder of Stem 1, providing
extra resistance to ribosome movement. At some specific
point, the resistance to ribosome movement provided by the
supercoiling counteracts the forward movement of the ribo-
some, increasing the likelihood that the ribosome will stop at
a precise point along the mRNA. Energetically, since full
unwinding of Stem 1 is dependent on complete denaturation
of Stem 2, the potential energy of unwinding of the pseudoknot
structure should similarly be directed toward one point.
Viewed either mechanically or energetically, this point is
where ribosomes will be directed to specifically pause on the
mRNA. If it occurs with the tRNAs in ribosomal A- and P-sites
positioned at the slippery site, then frameshifting is stimulated.
This is summarized in Figure 1B. The efficiency of 1 PRF
can thus be viewed as a function of (i) the fraction of
ribosomes paused over the slippery site and (ii) the rate at
which the structure can be denatured. There is increasing evi-
dence from single molecule experiments that unfolding occurs
in quick ‘rips’ at a particular force (13), suggesting that in the
case of unfolding pseudoknots, frameshifting efficiency is
related to both the energy barriers to unfolding the pseudoknot
structure and the resistance of the structure against the force of
the ribosome. In the context of the torsional restraint model,
this resistance is dependent on the ability of Stem 2 to remain
intact while Stem 1 is being unwound.
There is experimental data that indirectly support this
model: (i) disruption of the first 3 bp of Stem 1, which
would displace the ribosome’s pause site to a point 30 of
the slippery site, has been shown to eliminate frameshifting
(14); (ii) destabilizing Stem 2, which would allow it to be
unwound more readily, has been shown to result in decreased
frameshifting efficiency (15–17); (iii) replacing bulges in Stem
1 with base pairs would increase the energy required to unwind
the first three bases, and a longer ribosomal pause over the
slippery site would follow, yielding increased efficiencies in
1 frameshifting (15,18); (iv) destabilizing the base of Stem 1
by replacing G:C base pairs with A:U pairs decreases 1
frameshifting efficiencies (19,20); (v) the model eliminates
the need for a ‘pseudoknot recognizing factor’, the evidence
of which has not been forthcoming in either competition
assays in in vitro translation systems (21) or by gel retardation
assays (J. D. Dinman, unpublished data); and (vi) elimina-
tion of a potential torsion-restraining Stem 2, but not of a
non-torsion-restraining Stem 2 in HIV-1, resulted in
decreased 1 PRF efficiencies (22).
Though all of the cited studies support the torsional restraint
model, none has directly addressed it. In the experiments
presented in this study, a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknot’ con-
taining reporter constructs were used to test the torsional
restraint hypothesis. In vitro frameshifting assays show that

Figure 1. The torsional resistance model. (A) An elongating ribosome can easily unwind a simple stem–loop because there is no resistance to the rotation of the loop,
even with a long stem. Thus, the energy required to unwind the structure is broadly distributed along its length. (B) The ribosome meets added resistance to unwinding
Stem 1 of a pseudoknot because Loop 1 cannot easily rotate. The energy of unwinding is narrowly focused at one point in the structure. If the pseudoknot is properly
placed, the ribosome will be directed to pause with the slippery site positioned in the A- and P-site, setting up the frameshift. The theoretical ‘graphs’ are inserted to
further illustrate this point, though they are not based on any actual measurements.

frameshifting can be significantly stimulated by limiting the
rotational freedom of the loop region of a stem–loop structure,
and that the degree of rotational freedom of Stem 1 is import-
ant in determining the extent of 1 PRF. Furthermore, mRNA
toeprint analyses reveal a pseudo-pseudoknot-specific strong
stop 16 nt 30 of the slippery site, consistent with this structure
being able to direct ribosomes to pause with their A- and
P-sites positioned at the slippery site.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of plasmids
All synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were purchased by IDT
(Coralville, IA). The modified L-A viral 1 PRF signal con-
taining the G GGU UUA slippery site followed by a simple
stem–loop was amplified from pJD18 (23) using the primers
luc50b (50-CCCCAAGCTTATGACTTCTAGGCAGGGTTT-
AGG-30) and luc30b (50-CCCCCCATGGGACGTTGTAAA-
AACGACGGGATC-30). These were digested with HindIII
and NcoI (restriction sites are underlined) and cloned into
the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pT7-LUC minus 30-
untranslated region-A50 (24). In the resulting reporter con-
struct (pJD214-18), expression of firefly luciferase requires a
1 frameshift, and the 50 sequence of the Stem 2 is not able to
base pair with the 30 sequence, so that only a stem–loop rather
than a pseudoknot is able to form. The same primers were used
to amplify DNA from pJDRC (23) to make pJD214-Ry. In
this construct, complementary mutations (50-GCUGGC-30 to
50-CGACCG-30) in the 30 acceptor sequence of the
pseudoknot-forming region of Stem 2 allow the formation
of an mRNA pseudoknot that has previously been shown to
promote frameshifting at the same frequency as the wild type
(23). The primer luc50CON (50-CCCCAAGCTTATGACTTC-
TAGGCAAGGGTTTAGG-30) contains an additional A nuc-
leotide upstream of the slippery site and was used to make
pJD214-0, the zero-frame control. To eliminate the
possibility of internal initiation occurring at the luciferase
initiation codon downstream of the frameshift signals, the
AUG codon was changed to AUA. The Stratagene Quik-
Change kit was used to mutate pJD214-18 and pJD214-Ry
into pJD336-18 and pJD366-Ry, respectively, using the
oligonucleotides 50-GGCGTTCTTCTATGGGACGTTGTA-
AAAACGGATC-30 and 50-GATCCGTCGTTTTTACAACG-
TCCCATAGAAGACGCC-30 (the mutated codon is underlined).
pJD366-18 was further mutated to make a zero-frame control
by placing an A upstream of the slippery site using the oli-
gonucleotides 50-TGACTTCTAGGCAAGGGTTTAGGAG-
TG and 50-CACTCCTAAACCCTTGCCTAGAAGTCA (the
inserted base is underlined).
A series of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were designed
to join the loop acceptor region of mRNA transcribed from
pJD366-18 to the downstream region that forms the pseudo-
knot in the wild-type L-A 1 PRF signal. In the J-oligos, the 30
sequences base pair with the loop of the mRNA transcribed
from pJD366-18, and the 50 regions of these oligos base pair
with the downstream sequence. This orientation is reversed
for the R-oligos. These general orientations are shown in
Figure 3B. The naming of the oligonucleotide names refers
to the number of additional residues placed between the
regions of complementarity. The bases complementary to
the pJD366-18 sequence are underlined.

Preparation of plasmids and mRNA synthesis
Plasmid DNAs were prepared using the Qiagen mini-prep kits
and were linearized with DraI in a total volume of 20 ml.
Proteins were eliminated by the addition of 2 ml of 1 mg/ml
proteinase K and SDS to a final concentration of 0.5% fol-
lowed by digestion at 50C for 30 min. Volumes were then
increased to 100 ml, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform,
and DNA was precipitated with 10 ml NH4Ac and 250 ml
ethanol. The purified DNA was resuspended in DEPC-
treated H2O. To prepare synthetic mRNAs, 2 ml of purified
linear DNAs were used for in vitro transcription using the
Ambion T7 mMachine mMessage kit. RNAs were precipit-
ated using 30 ml DEPC H2O and 25 ml LiAc. The RNA was
resuspended in 11 ml DEPC H2O (1 ml in 500 would give an
OD260 of 0.05–00.1; 1–2 mg/ml).
In vitro translation and frameshifting assays
To anneal the oligonucleotides with the mRNA, J-oligos,
R-oligos or the equivalent volumes of dilution buffer alone
(20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM EDTA final
concentration) were added to synthetic mRNA (0.5 mg), and
the mixtures were first incubated in a 70C heating block for
10 min; the block was then removed and allowed to cool to
37C (30 min), after which they were briefly spun down and
incubated on ice. In all experiments, the molar ratios of J- and
R-oligos to synthetic mRNAs were 100:1. In experiments
using the competing oligonucleotide (C-oligo), this was
added to either 0.5:1 or 1:1 molar ratios with either J- or
R-oligonucleotides. Reticulocyte lysates were thawed on
ice, 15 ml of met and 15 ml of leu master mixes plus
20 ml of H2O were added to 400 ml of lysate, and 19 ml of
this was added to each annealed reaction to start the in vitro
translation reactions. These were incubated at 30C for 60 min
(the reaction reached a plateau after 30–35 min where the
greatest difference was seen between the zero-frame controls
and the frameshifting plasmids) (data not shown), and the
reactions were then placed on ice. An aliquot of 7.5 ml
from each in vitro translation reaction was added to 50 ml
of the prewarmed luciferase reagent, and luminescence read-
ings were taken after a 3 s delay for 15 s in triplicate using a
Turner 20/20 Luminometer.
RNase assay
Synthetic transcripts generated from DraI-digested pJD366-18
(1.7 kb) were 50 end labeled using [g-32P]CTP. These RNAs
(4 ml) were incubated with 1 ml of annealing buffer and either
1 ml of H2O or 1 ml of an oligo (0.25 ng) at 70C. The heating
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 6 1827
block was allowed to cool at room temperature for 40 min
before 8 ml of RNaseH buffer was added (20 mM HEPES,
50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT). An aliquot of 1 ml
of enzyme was added (mung bean nuclease, RNaseH or
RNaseT1) and the reactions incubated at 37C for 1 h. The
reactions were stopped by adding 4 ml of stop solution, the
products separated through a 6% polyacrylamide–urea dena-
turing gel and visualized by autoradiography.
mRNA toeprinting
JD366-18 mRNA (1 mg in 8 ml) was annealed with 2 ml of 30
end-labeled toeprinting primer (50-CGTACGTGATCTTCA-
CC-30, complementary to sequence 240 bp 30 of the slippery
site) as described above. This was added to 15 ml of lysate
(200 ml Ambion retic lysate, 7.5 ml of each master mix [leu
and met] and 70 ml of 250 mM KCl), except for 2 ml, which
was added to 15 ml of RT buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (25), 40 mM
KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT and 575 mM dNTPs] to be used
as a no-ribosome control. In vitro translation reactions were
incubated at room temperature for 10 min, which was empir-
ically determined to provide the optimum amount of time to
allow ribosomes to initiate translation and pause at the frame-
shift signal. Subsequently, 15 ml of RT buffer containing
RNasin inhibitor and cycloheximide (to a final concentration
of 100 ng/ml) was added to stop translation. To this, 2 ml of
Superscript II (Invitrogen) was added and the reaction incub-
ated at room temperature for 10 min. Reactions were termin-
ated by phenol:chloroform extraction and 15 ml of stop
solution added. The toeprinting primer was also used in con-
junction with pJD366-18 to produce sequencing ladders
by standard dideoxynucleotide chain termination methods
using Sequenase (USB). Products were separated though
6% polyacrylamide–urea denaturing gels and visualized
using a Storm phosphorImager (Pharmacia).
RESULTS
Pseudo-pseudoknots stimulate frameshifting, and
frameshifting efficiency changes with the degree
of pseudo-pseudoknot rotational freedom
We previously showed in intact yeast cells that the pseudoknot
containing mRNA produced from pJDRCwas able to promote
efficient 1 PRF, whereas one in which only a stem–loop can
form, transcribed from pJD18, could not (23). As a first step in
this study, we tested the ability of synthetic mRNAs produced
from pJD366-RC and from pJD366-18, two plasmids derived
from these parental constructs, to promote 1 PRF. Total
luciferase activities produced from these synthetic mRNAs
were divided by the luciferase activity produced from the
zero-frame control plasmid, pJD366-0, and multiplied by
100% to determine 1 PRF efficiencies. The results show
that the trends observed in yeast were replicated in vitro,
i.e. JD366-RC mRNA promoted 8% efficiency of 1
PRF as compared with 1.1% promoted by JD366-18
mRNA (Figure 2).
The ‘torsional restraint’ model predicts that conditions that
would inhibit the rotational freedom of the loop region of the
pJD366-18-derived mRNA should result in enhanced 1 PRF
efficiency. The strategy used in this study was to anneal this
mRNA with synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to
both the loop region and to the sequence downstream that
is normally involved in pseudoknot formation. These ‘pseudo-
pseudoknots’ would be predicted to restore a pseudoknot-like
structure to the mRNA. This is diagrammed in Figure 3A. Two
different classes of oligonucleotides having different orienta-
tions relative to the mRNA were used to this end: ‘joining’ (J-)
and ‘reverse’ (R-) oligos. The orientation of the J-oligos pro-
motes the formation of a structure containing the equivalent of
a Loop 2 region, while that of the R-oligos promotes a Loop 1
equivalent. The model also predicts that pseudo-pseudoknots
having different degrees of rotational freedom should promote
different frequencies of ribosome pausing over the slippery
site, resulting in different efficiencies of 1 PRF. In order to
control this parameter, increasing numbers of nucleotides were
inserted between the mRNA hybridizing regions of the J- and
R-oligos. The additional non-complementary bases in the
J-oligos are 30 to the stem–loop residues involved in Stem 2,
thus effectively increasing Loop 2. Similarly, the additional
non-complementary bases in the R-oligos are 50 to the loop
acceptor residues and correspond to an increased Loop 1. The
structure of the stem–loop of pJD366-18 and its maximum
base-paired interactions with representative J- and R-oligos are
shown in Figure 3B. To demonstrate that an oligonucleotide–
mRNA hybrid was capable of forming under the assay
conditions, the J1-oligo was incubated with 50 [32P]labeled
JD366-18 mRNA and subjected to RNaseH digestion. Diges-
tion of the RNA–DNA hybrid resulted in a labeled 110 nt
fragment, demonstrating that the oligonucleotide bound to
the mRNA at the position of the pseudoknot (Figure 4).
Having demonstrated the utility of the in vitro frameshifting
assay and that the J- and R-series of oligonucleotides were able
to hybridize with synthetic mRNA produced from pJD366-18,
the next step was to monitor frameshifting efficiencies pro-
moted by these hybrid species. Significant increases in frame-
shifting were observed with the incubation of pJD366-18
mRNA with oligonucleotides J1 (10%) and J2 (35%),
while only modest increases were seen with J3 and J4
(Figure 5). These findings are consistent with the notion
that changes in the degree of rotational freedom of the

structure would affect the distribution of paused ribosomes in
the vicinity of the slippery site.
One potential complication with the J-oligos is the possib-
ility that they could interact with the Loop 2–Stem 1 region. In
the R-oligos, the additional bases are distal to any possible
Loop 2–Stem 1 interactions and would be more analogous to
increasing Loop 1. The R-oligos stimulated1 PRF to an even
higher extent than the J-oligos (Figure 5). Importantly,

rotational freedom of the stem–loop, resulted in decreased
frameshifting activity as predicted by the torsional resistance
model. However, addition of three residues between the two
binding regions of the R-oligo (R4) resulted in an unexpec-
ted increase in frameshifting with a very large amount of
variation.
In a series of control experiments, 8 nt oligos complement-
ary to the 50 (Loop 1) and 30 Stem 2 forming regions of the
pseudo-pseudoknot were hybridized to the SL mRNA and 1
PRF assays were performed. Neither of these were able to
stimulate 1 PRF, even at concentrations in 100-fold molar
excess to the mRNA template (data not shown). Though sup-
portive of our central hypothesis, it is also possible that these
results were due to the thermodynamic instability of the
RNA:DNA duplexes through the course of the experimental
protocol.
Pseudo-pseudoknot structure and function can be
competed away
To determine whether the stimulation of frameshifting was
specifically due to the bridging of the stem–loop with down-
stream sequence (the pseudo-pseudoknot), as opposed to the
nonspecific presence of an RNA:DNA hybrid, the competing
oligonucleotide (C-oligo) was designed to form a 15 bp duplex
with JD366-18 mRNA, including the 30 Stem 2 forming
region, which was expected to significantly out compete either
the J- or R-oligos from binding to this site, thus disrupting
formation of the pseudo-pseudoknot (see Figure 3A). Addi-
tionally, in the presence of the C-oligo, the J- and R-oligos
were still predicted to hybridize with the 50 Stem 2 forming
region, enabling us to address the question of whether this
interaction alone was able to stimulate frameshifting. The
results demonstrate that the addition of the C-oligo severely
inhibited the abilities of both the J- and R-oligos to promote
efficient frameshifting (Figure 6). These findings demonstrate
that (i) frameshifting was specifically stimulated by bridging
of the 50 and 30 Stem 2 forming regions by the J- and R-oligos,
and (ii) that the presence of an RNA:DNA hybrid at the
50 Stem 2 forming region was not sufficient to stimulate
frameshifting by itself.
Pseudo-pseudoknots direct ribosomes to pause over

Figure 5. Efficient frameshifting is stimulated by pseudo-pseudoknots. In vitro translation assays were performed in retic lysates with mRNAs derived from pJD366-
18 (SL) to which J- or R-oligos were annealed. Luciferase activities were divided by those obtained using mRNAs generated from pJD366-0, and the resulting ratios
were multiplied by 100 to calculate percent frameshifting. The averages of three independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown. Error bars denote
standard deviation.

on the mRNA, rather than being distributed along Stem 1. We
used mRNA toeprint assays to test this hypothesis. In mRNA
toeprint reactions, the movement of reverse transcriptase is
blocked by paused ribosomes, resulting in a strong stop
positioned 16–18 nt 30 of the P-site of eukaryotic ribosomes
(25). Synthetic JD366-18 mRNAs were annealed with the
sequencing oligonucleotide and either J1, R1 or no second
oligo, and these were then used for in vitro translation reac-
tions. After a period of time (10 min were empirically deter-
mined to be optimal), elongation reactions were stopped by
the addition of cycloheximide, and reverse transcription reac-
tions were initiated on the sequencing oligonucleotides. In
parallel, control reverse transcription reactions were carried
out using synthetic JD366-18 mRNA and oligonucleotides, but
without in vitro translation. The results are consistent with the
model, showing that the J1- and R1-oligos specifically pro-
moted one strong reverse transcriptase stop 16 nt 30 of the
P-site of the slippery site only the in the in vitro translation
reactions (Figure 7). As further predicted by the model, a broad
distribution of stops of equal intensities was observed in this
region with JD366-18 mRNA alone (Figure 7, lane 1). Import-
antly, the +16 stop was not observed when toeprint reactions
were carried in the absence of ribosomes. Additional strong
stops were also of interest. One corresponding to the 30 end of
the base of Stem 1 was observed in all samples, consistent with
the presence of this structure. Both J- and R-oligo-specific
pauses were also observed. The reason for the strong pause
in the J-oligo is unknown. The R-oligo-specific pause is per-
haps more revealing. It occurs at the 30 end of the RNA:DNA
hybrid formed by this oligo and the mRNA, a structure that
should also promote pausing of reverse transcriptase.
DISCUSSION
The results presented in this study provide strong support for
the torsional restraint model of programmed 1 frameshift-
ing. Specifically, we demonstrated that RNA:DNA hybrids
that mimic mRNA pseudoknots can significantly stimulate
frameshifting. As predicted by the model, changing the rota-
tional freedom of the structure by altering the lengths in the
J1- and R1-oligos between the 50 and 30 mRNA hybridizing
regions resulted in changes in their abilities to stimulate 1
frameshifting. The demonstration that these ‘pseudo-
pseudoknot’ structures cause elongating ribosomes to specif-
ically pause with their A- and P-sites positioned at the slippery
site provides independent evidence in support of the model.
In the case of the J-oligo series, frameshifting was best
stimulated by J2, suggesting the structure created and the
rotational freedom allowed by it was optimal for 1 PRF.
The experimental design is such that we assume a similar rate
of unfolding for each oligo as the predicted maximum base
pairing is the same for them all. However, we do note that the
type of nucleotides separating the two, separately paired
regions of the oligos, and their presentation, may play a
role in 1 PRF efficiency. The recent NMR structural solution
of the SRV-1 pseudoknot revealed a highly structured Loop 2–
Stem 1 interface including base triples involving an A residue
at the 30 end of Loop 2 (26). The additional base in the J2-
oligonucleotide is also an A. Mutagenesis experiments in this
region by other groups showed, for example, that replacing
the 30 base in Loop 2 of IBV with an A residue promoted a
significant increase in frameshifting efficiency (27), and
mutation or removal of the A residue at the 30 base in
Loop 2 of the BWYV pseudoknot reduced frameshifting levels
(17). This part of the pseudoknot has been proposed to be
important in a frameshifting model where differential trans-
ition state energy barriers (due to small differences in local
structure, stability or dynamics) are the primary determinant of
frameshifting efficiency (3). Indeed, a Loop 2–Stem 1 triplex
interaction seen in smaller frameshifting pseudoknots from
luteoviruses has been shown to be critical for 1 PRF, and
that similar pseudoknots lacking the triplex are less efficient at
frameshifting [(28) and references therein]. This extra struc-
tural feature would limit the rate of unfolding and provide
extra anchoring of Stem 2 as the ribosome attempts to unwind
Stem 1, i.e. it too would help to provide additional torsional
restraint. It is also possible that although the J3- and J4-
oligonucleotides also help to form a pseudo-pseudoknot, the
additional bases may interfere with the stabilization of Stem 1.
With the R-oligos, a general correlation was observed
between minimization of rotational freedom and frameshifting
efficiency, though this was not the case of the R4-oligo. Since
the stability of the pseudo-pseudoknot generated with R4
should be similar to that of the other oligonucleotides based
on the base-pairing, this result suggests that there are
additional considerations to be uncovered with regard to the

Figure 6. Competition for J- or R-oligo binding sites inhibits its ability to
promote efficient frameshifting. mRNA transcribed from pJD366-18 (SL)
was annealed with either J- or R-oligos alone, or in combination with different
concentrations of competing (C-) oligos (in ratios of 2:1 or equimolar as
indicated). Sample marked SL is mRNA alone. Luciferase activities generated
from in vitro translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysates were divided
by those obtained using mRNAs generated from pJD366-0, and the resulting
ratios were multiplied by 100 to calculate percent frameshifting.

pseudoknot structure influencing frameshifting. Addition of
residues in the R-oligos was analogous to lengthening
Loop 1, which is typically short in 1 frameshifting pseudo-
knots. Limited and conflicting data are available on the import-
ance of Loop 1 in 1 frameshifting pseudoknots. In one study,
addition of three A bases to Loop 1 did not affect frameshifting
efficiency (15), while in another all the mutations made in this
region were detrimental to frameshifting efficiency (17).
Given the complex interactions occurring between the helices
and loops in this region, we cannot yet account for why the
R4-oligo stimulated frameshifting so efficiently and with such
variable results.
Examination of the RNA toeprint data presented here
reveals that both of the pseudo-pseudoknot structures formed
by the J1- and R1-oligos promoted strong stops of the reverse
transcriptase 16 nt 30 of the P-site codon of the slippery site,
consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of Stem 2
forces ribosomes to pause with their A- and P-sites positioned
over the slippery site. Previous studies mapping the lagging
edge of paused ribosomes, i.e. mRNA heelprint studies, did
not reveal any striking differences between the effects of
pseudoknots versus stem–loops (8,16). Interestingly, using
this method, the ribosomal pauses appeared distributed over
a broader stretch of mRNA (4 nt) than observed here. It is
possible that some critical level of resolution is lost in the
requirement for many additional manipulations of substrates
using the mRNA heelprint as compared with the toeprint
methods.
A remaining question centers on whether the role of the
RNA pseudoknot in 1 PRF is passive or active. In the ‘9 A˚
solution’ (6), the frameshift mechanism is activated by move-
ment of the A-site codon–anticodon complex by 1 base in the
50 direction upon accommodation. As currently described, the
mRNA pseudoknot merely passively blocks entry of the down-
stream message into the ribosome, resulting in stretching of
the segment of mRNA located between the codon–anticodon
complex and the pseudoknot. By this model, all of the ener-
getic input for the frameshift is derived from hydrolysis of
GTP by eEF1A. However, it is possible that the pseudoknot
may also actively contribute to the frameshift mechanism.
Specifically, pulling the downstream message into the ribo-
some at accommodation could result in unwinding of Stem 1
of the pseudoknot by one additional base pair. The energetic
cost of so doing would be to introduce an equivalent amount of
torsional resistance into Stem 2. If Stem 2 were to release
this resistance by ‘pulling back’, the base pair in Stem 1
would be re-formed, which in turn would contribute to the
energy required to dissociate the A- and P-site codon–
anticodon complexes from the zero-frame. This would be
followed by slippage of the mRNA by 1 base in the 30 direction
relative to the ribosome, followed by the formation of 1
frame codon–anticodon complexes. As such, the proposed
active role for the mRNA pseudoknot would further reduce
the energetic barrier to 1 PRF. In sum, we suggest that the
‘torsional restraint model’ can be combined with the ‘9 A˚
solution’ to mechanistically explain the original ‘simultaneous

Figure 7. Pseudo-pseudoknots direct ribosomes to pause over the slippery site. mRNAs generated from pJD366-18 (SL) were annealed with the sequencing
oligonucleotide and either J1-, R1- or no oligo (lanes 1, 2 and 3, respectively), and these were then used for in vitro translation reactions. Reactions were stopped after
10 min by the addition of cycloheximide, and reverse transcription reactions were initiated on the sequencing oligonucleotides. In parallel, control reverse
transcription reactions were carried out using synthetic JD366-18 mRNA and oligonucleotides, but without in vitro translation (lanes 4–6). The positions of
the slippery site, loops and stems of the pseudo-pseudoknots are indicated next to a sequencing reaction. Arrowheads indicate positions of reverse transcriptase strong
stops and these are mapped to a representation of the stem–loop structure of pJD366-18.

slippage’ model of 1 PRF (9,10). In other words, the 9 A˚
solution + torsional restraint = simultaneous slippage.
Two recent publications have also shown that
oligonucleotide:mRNA duplexes can stimulate efficient 1
ribosomal frameshifting (29,30). These studies differed
from the present one in a number of ways, particularly insofar
as they examined the effects duplex structures immediately 30
of the slippery site rather than addressing mRNA pseudoknot
related questions. The findings support the notion that the
specific location of ribosome pausing on the mRNA plays a
critical role in determining frameshifting, though they do
come with caveats, e.g. neither study directly mapped ribo-
somal pausing, and the use of different slippery sites and
downstream contexts likely contributed to disparate findings
for the optimal distances between the 30 ends of slippery sites
and 50 ends of frameshift-stimulating oligonucleotides.
Although potentially useful therapeutically there are no
known natural examples of frameshifting stimulated in this
manner, and thus these results do not affect the hypothesis
presented here. However, these studies are important in that
they raise the possibility for a new role for micro-RNAs in
regulating gene expression, and for therapeutic approaches to
correcting inborn errors of metabolism due to the presence of
frameshift mutations.
