ABSTRACT
Thousands of mutations are identified yearly.
Although many directly affect protein expression,
an increasing proportion of mutations is now
believed to influence mRNA splicing. They mostly
affect existing splice sites, but synonymous,
non-synonymous or nonsense mutations can also
create or disrupt splice sites or auxiliary cis-splicing
sequences. To facilitate the analysis of the different
mutations, we designed Human Splicing Finder
(HSF), a tool to predict the effects of mutations on
splicing signals or to identify splicing motifs in any
human sequence. It contains all available matrices
for auxiliary sequence prediction as well as new
ones for binding sites of the 9G8 and Tra2-b
Serine-Arginine proteins and the hnRNP A1 ribonu-
cleoprotein. We also developed new Position Weight
Matrices to assess the strength of 5’ and 3’ splice
sites and branch points. We evaluated HSF effi-
ciency using a set of 83 intronic and 35 exonic muta-
tions known to result in splicing defects. We showed
that the mutation effect was correctly predicted in
almost all cases. HSF could thus represent a valu-
able resource for research, diagnostic and thera-
peutic (e.g. therapeutic exon skipping) purposes as
well as for global studies, such as the GEN2PHEN
European Project or the Human Variome Project.
INTRODUCTION
Since its discovery more than three decades ago (1),
mRNA splicing is the focus of many studies both in fun-
damental and applied research. Splicing is part of the pre-
mRNA maturation process that occurs in each eukaryotic
cell between mRNA transcription from DNA and its
translation into protein. During this event, parts of the
pre-mRNA transcripts are removed in a ribonucleoprotein
complex (spliceosome) which is constituted of ﬁve essen-
tial small nuclear RNAs and more than 150 polypeptides
(2,3). Depending on tissue localization and/or stage of
development, pre-mRNA transcripts may be diﬀerentially
spliced, allowing several transcripts to be built and thus
diﬀerent proteins to be synthesized from the same gene. A
prime example of this phenomenon is the Troponin T gene
for which 64 diﬀerent mRNAs have been described (4).
This process is called alternative splicing and it is estimated
that more than 70% of human protein-coding genes are
alternatively spliced (5). Understanding how splicing is
regulated is thus crucial, particularly in a medical context,
since genomic variations which cause aberrant splicing
may represent up to 50% of all mutations that lead to
gene dysfunction (6). Mutations can indeed not only
alter directly the sequence that will be translated into pro-
tein, for instance, base substitutions can change a codon
for an amino acid into another one or into a premature
termination codon (PTC), but can also aﬀect splicing and,
as a consequence, lead to the appearance of truncated
proteins or to the lack of the correct gene product.
How are exons and introns recognized during the
splicing process? Exon deﬁnition (7) is the identiﬁcation
of splice sites located at the 50 and 30 ends of exon–intron–
exon junctions (50ss and 30ss also known as donor and
acceptor splice site, respectively). At 30 end of introns, a
branch point sequence and a polypyrimidine tract, which
are situated upstream the 30ss, are also used as consensus
elements. These consensus sequences have probably
evolved from ancestral common sequences as it has been
reported for the 50 site with the AG/guaagu prototype
sequence whose eight contiguous nucleotides are comple-
mentary to nucleotides 4–11 of U1RNA (8). The diver-
gence of splice site sequences from the prototypes has been
closely associated with the creation of alternative tran-
scripts. Moreover, in higher eukaryotes, these highly
degenerated motifs can also be found in most introns,
framing pseudo-exons. Pseudo-exons are intronic
sequences of typical exon size that outnumber real exons
and are bounded by sequences that match the 50 and 30

splicing signal requirements of an exon, but that are never
considered as proper exons by the spliceosome.
Furthermore, human transcripts contain many ‘decoy’
splice sites that are seldom used. So, while 50 and 30 spli-
cing signals are mandatory for exon deﬁnition, they are
not suﬃcient for correct splicing. In order to reliably dis-
tinguish authentic exons and splice sites from pseudo-
exons and decoy splice sites, the splicing machinery must
rely on auxiliary sequence features, such as intronic and
exonic cis-elements. Among them, the Exonic Splicing
Enhancers (ESEs) are the most studied. They are speciﬁc
short nucleotide sequences that are targeted essentially by
Serine/Argine-rich (SR) proteins which then promote
exon deﬁnition (9). Conversely, the Exonic Splicing
Silencers (ESSs) help the spliceosome to ignore pseudo-
exons and decoy splice sites. They act as binding sites
for proteins promoting exon exclusion (mainly hnRNP
proteins) (10). Intronic Splicing Enhancers (ISEs) and
Intronic Splicing Silencers (ISSs) are intronic cis-elements
that play similar roles as ESEs and ESSs.
Several bioinformatics tools to study or predict splice
signals have been developed and are today available
online. Their approaches can vary (11) from using blastn
to align a query sequence to a database of alternative
splicing events and splice signals (12) to an ab initio pre-
diction approach (13). Despite the quality of these
tools and because of the complexity of sequence signals
harbored by any mRNA sequence, new tools are
needed to simultaneously identify putative donor
and acceptor splice sites, branch points and cis-acting
elements (ESE, ESS, ISE and ISS). In addition, since
many human disease-causing mutations aﬀect splicing,
new bioinformatics tools should also be able to predict
the consequence of mutations on splice signals. Such
tool could be of great value not only for geneticists to
better understand splicing events and the eﬀect of muta-
tions on mRNA splicing, but also for clinical researchers
to design new therapeutic approaches based on splicing
interference, such as the exon-skipping strategy used
in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) (14) or gene
and exon silencing through manipulation of mRNA splic-
ing (15).
In this article, we present a new bioinformatics tool,
the Human Splicing Finder (HSF) software that is freely
available online (http://www.umd.be/HSF/). It includes
new algorithms derived from the Universal Mutation
Database (UMD) (16,17) to allow the evaluation of the
strength of 50ss, 30ss and branch points. In addition, in
order to identify cis-acting elements it includes already
published algorithms, such as the RESCUE-ESE (18)
and ESE-Finder (19) as well as new algorithms designed
to use available or newly created matrices. To allow the
study of virtually any human sequence, HSF includes all
genes and alternative transcripts as well as intronic
sequences that were extracted from the Ensembl human
genome database (http://www.ensembl.org/) (20). To eval-
uate the predictive potential of HSF web interface (version
2.4; http://www.umd.be/HSF/), we used a set of mutations
for which the eﬀect on splicing has been experimentally
demonstrated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Software development and database design
HSF was developed using the 4D package (4D S.A.) for
data management, algorithm design and web interface.
The HSF database was designed to include the introns
and exons of all human genes. It was constructed from
an Ensembl dataset (20) containing more than 22 000
genes and 46 000 transcripts of Homo sapiens (release
44, http://april2007.archive.ensembl.org) using Biomart
(20). Genes were created from the crude dataset using
both Ensembl transcript coordinates and sequences
from the UCSC genome browser database (21). At pre-
sent, HSF database only contains human genes, since
matrices and tools were speciﬁcally designed for the
human genome.
To study the potential eﬀects of single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) on splicing, HSF also harbors data
extracted from the Ensembl Variation database (20). For
this, a Perl script was developed, using Ensembl Perl API
that allows HSF to directly query the Ensembl Variation
database and retrieve SNPs located in human genes.
Splicing donor/acceptor sites
To predict potential 50ss and 30ss, we used matrices derived
from Shapiro and Senapathy (22). A potential splice site is
deﬁned as an n-mer sequence. For each ‘n’ position, a
weight is given to each nucleotide, based on its frequency
and the relative importance of its position in the sequence
motif (position weight matrices, PWM). The strength
of a site is thus deﬁned as the sum of each nucleotide’s
weight plus a constant (Equation 1) that is used for nor-
malization. Only n-mer sequences with consensus values
(CV) higher or equal to a given threshold are considered
as potential 50 or 30ss.
Since the human 50 consensus sequence is [C/A]AG/
gt[a/g]agt, we deﬁned the 50ss as a 9-mer matrix.
Similarly, the 30ss was deﬁned as a 14-mer matrix.

50ss x=9 and for 30ss x=14.

HSF also includes an algorithm adapted from the MaxEnt
script (23) that allows the analysis of a whole sequence. In
addition, for this matrix, users can deﬁne thresholds for
splice site prediction.
Branch point sequences
Since the human branch point (BP) consensus sequence is
YNYCRAY (24), we deﬁned the BP sequence as a 7 4
position weight matrix (Figure 1). The threshold for BP
sequences was ﬁxed at 67. The strength of a BP sequence
was thus calculated as follows (Equation 2):

Since many intronic sequences match the BP consensus
sequence, we included the AG-Exclusion Zone algorithm
described by Gooding et al. (25) to predict BP candidates.
For a given intronic sequence and its intron-exon bound-
ary, HSF searches all AG dinucleotides that are included
in a 30ss candidate sequence (threshold of 67) and there-
fore deﬁne the exclusion zones. As it has been shown that
the BP allows the recognition of the ﬁrst downstream 30ss,
HSF annotates the functional BP as the strongest candi-
date without a 30-exclusion zone before the natural 30ss.
Additionally, to take into account the steric obstruction
caused by the spliceosome, we excluded BP sequences
located at less than 12 nt from the exon. Finally, as most
BP sequences are located between 21 and 34 nt from
the exon (26), only a window of 100 bp is processed. We
arbitrarily excluded the probability of having a BP motif
located very far away in order to save computation time.
Matrices for splicing enhancers and silencers
To maximize the detection of auxiliary motifs, HSF inte-
grated: (i) matrices for SR proteins (SRp40, SC35, SF2/
ASF, SF2/ASF IgM/BRCA1 and SRp55) from the ESE
Finder tool (19,27); (ii) sequence motifs shown to be dif-
ferentially present in exons and introns, such as the
RESCUE-ESE hexamers (18), the putative 8-mer ESE
and ESS identiﬁed by Zhang and Chasin (28), the ESR
sequences identiﬁed by Goren and co-workers (29) and the
exon-identity elements (EIE) and intron-identity elements
(IIE) deﬁned by Zhang and co-workers (30). For the
silencer sequences identiﬁed by Sironi and colleagues
(31) and the ESS decamers (32), for which no web-based
tool were available, we developed new algorithms to use
the crude data.
New matrices were also created to predict hnRNP A1,
Tra2-b and 9G8 protein binding motifs. These matrices
were designed using published data collected from
SELEX experiments and consensus sequences. Sequences
were aligned with ClustalW (33) to generate a consensus
motif. Note that these motifs were too short to be pro-
cessed with MEME (34). The consensus sequences were
then used to design PWM matrices (Figure 2).
Sequence datasets used to evaluate HSF efficiency
To evaluate the new algorithms dedicated to the predic-
tion of 50ss and 30ss, we used the Ensembl database
(20) that contain 245.286 human exons (release 44,
http://april2007.archive.ensembl.org). For BP predictions,
we used a set of 14 experimentally validated BPs (Table 3).
These datasets were completed by 69 intronic mutations
(35–56) as well as 15 exonic mutations known to alter 50
and 30ss (57,58) and for whom the impact on mRNA splic-
ing has been characterized in vivo or in vitro. To evaluate
the ability to correctly predict ESE and ESS, we used a set
of 20 experimentally validated mutations that aﬀect splic-
ing by a direct eﬀect on ESE and/or ESS (58–66). In
addition we used a set of 36 mutations previously reported
to alter splicing (positive controls) and 220 SNPs (negative
controls). The negative controls were extracted from the
dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/
SNP/) and corresponded to SNPs with the highest minor
allele frequency and, therefore, had a minimal risk of
aﬀecting splicing. Conversely, the positive controls were
chosen because experimental results showed that these
mutations targeted auxiliary splicing sequence motifs.
Nevertheless, in most cases the data about the exact
motif and/or the protein that recognizes this motif were
not available. For each mutation, we evaluated only its
eﬀects in terms of disruption of ESE or creation of ESS
signals (Supplementary Table 1).

Only default parameters are displayed on the submission
form while skilled users can easily access advanced param-
eters. Sequences stored in the database can be queried
using either the gene symbol, the Ensembl gene ID, the
Ensembl transcript ID, the RefSeq peptide ID or the con-
sensus CDS. In addition, users can process their own
sequences, either for simple sequence analysis or mutant
comparison. In addition, HSF can be queried in diﬀerent
ways: full analysis of a sequence, comparison of a mutant
and a wild-type sequence, or simultaneous analysis of sev-
eral mutants related, or not, to the same transcript. In this
case all mutations should be referred to sequences
included in the HSF database. In order to easily study a
group of mutations from diﬀerent genes and transcripts,
the mutation must be described by using the international
nomenclature system for cDNA mutations (67) (http://
www.genomic.unimelb.edu.au/mdi/mutnomen/). HSF
will then check that each mutation is correctly described
and automatically reconstruct the mutant allele from the
wild-type sequence and the mutation name. Since only
small rearrangements (i.e. substitutions, small exonic or
intronic deletions and insertions, duplications and indels)
provide useful information about splicing defects, large
rearrangements can not be processed by HSF.
Moreover, diﬀerently from previous resources, the user
can speciﬁcally analyze BP sequences or splice site motifs
using HSF speciﬁc matrices and algorithms.
The main result page was divided in three areas: the
reference sequence(s), various graphical displays and
tables. Since mutations could have diﬀerent eﬀects related
to the local context, a ‘quick mutation’ option allows the
addition of a small rearrangement (missense, deletion,
insertion, duplication, indel) to the sequence(s).
Splicing donor/acceptor sites
The new HSF algorithm to deﬁne consensus values (CV)
of 50ss or 30ss was created to maximize the diﬀerence
between wild-type (wt) active sites and mutant inactive
sites. Thus, strong sites presented a CV higher than 80
and less strong sites a CV ranging between 70 and 80.
Only a minor fraction of active sites showed a CV between
65 and 70 (Figure 3). The mean CV for 30ss was 86.81 with
a standard deviation of 6.33 while the mean CV for 50ss
was 87.53 with a standard deviation of 8.34. These values
were calculated from more than 400 000 natural splice
sites extracted from all alternative transcripts. If a muta-
tion aﬀects directly the CV, it is critical to consider not
only the CV of the mutant splice site, but also the delta
between the wt and mutant CV. To validate this algo-
rithm, we used a set of 69 intronic mutations that aﬀect
either the canonical AG/GT splice site motifs or less con-
served nucleotides (Table 1). All mutations aﬀecting the
nucleotides in canonical positions (2, 1, +1 or +2)
strongly inﬂuenced the CV value with an average

reduction (CV) of 31% and a standard deviation (SD) of
2.8%. Mutations aﬀecting less conserved residues had a
weaker eﬀect with aCV of 7% for the residue in position
+4 and 14% for nucleotides in position +3 or +5. These
results together with data from other disease-causing
mutations (52,68,69) indicated that a CV reduction of
at least 10% for a mutation in any position or of 7% for a
mutation in position +4 is likely to have a signiﬁcant
impact on splicing and should be further investigated.
Since a mutation can result not only in the disruption of
a 50ss or a 30ss, but also in the creation of a new splice site,
HSF evaluates the ‘creation of cryptic splice sites’. As
shown in Table 1 for intronic mutations, HSF correctly
predicted the creation of cryptic splice sites in the RB1
mutants c.607+1delG, c.138-8T>G and c.501-1G>A.
Mutations in canonical sequences, such as c.95-2A>G,
c.1397-2A>G and c.1397-1G>A in TGFBR2, c.2293+
2T>C, c.3463+1G>A, c.4747+5G>T and c.5788+
1G>A in FBN1 and c.1815-2A>G, c.2107-2A>G and
c.2211+1G>C in RB1, led to a more complex splicing
defect in which disruption of the wt splice site was coupled
to the usage of an alternative, pre-existing splice site. As
mutations do not directly aﬀect alternative splice sites, this
phenomenon was not automatically investigated by HSF.
Therefore, to identify the alternative splice sites, we chose
in ‘Select an analysis type’ the option ‘Number of nucleo-
tides surrounding the exon’ and entered the value ‘100’. In
addition, we checked the advanced parameter ‘Process
sequence’ and selected the ‘Full sequence’ option. To ana-
lyze only splice sites, we then selected in ‘All or subset of
matrices’ the ‘Splice site matrices’ option. Using these
parameters, all alternative sites were identiﬁed either as
the closest and strongest alternative sites (ﬁve cases) or
as the second-best sites (two cases). Overall, HSF correctly
predicted the impact of mutations aﬀecting 50ss or 30ss,
even when complex mechanisms were involved.
In addition to splicing defects due to 50ss or 30ss disrup-
tion, it is well known that exonic mutations could result in
the creation or activation of cryptic splice sites. As shown
in Table 2, the nine mutations aﬀecting the last base of an
exon had a strong eﬀect on the activity of the concerned
50ss (CV=12% 0.7) that resulted in exon skipping or
activation of a cryptic splice site. The two mutations
aﬀecting the penultimate nucleotide of an exon had a lim-
ited eﬀect on the activity of the 50ss (CV=5.4% 0.3).
Indeed, these mutations were pathogenic only when a
cryptic splice site was activated and therefore predictions
were hazardous. Finally, exonic mutations that were dis-
tant both from the 50 and 30ss could activate a cryptic
splice site and result in splicing defects as shown for muta-
tions c.658C>G in RB1, c.1915C>T in MSH2 and
c.5985T>G in DMD.
Branch point sequences
We analyzed 14 BP sequences previously reported to
be abolished by mutations. As shown in Table 3, 13 out
of 14 BPs were correctly predicted by HSF with an aver-
age strength of 83.4 and a standard deviation of 8.6.
The only discrepancy concerned the mutation localized
in intron 3 of GH1 for which the BP was predicted to
be at position 26 by HSF instead of position 21.
Note that in both cases, the BP was located within the
c.468-37_468-16del which is responsible for the cases of
autosomal dominant, isolated GH deﬁciency (IGHDII)
in one single family and therefore additional data are
needed to identify the functional BP. Among the other
BP sequences, 12 were reported as targets of point muta-
tions leading to their inactivation. In six cases, the muta-
tion involved the critical adenosine residue, leading to a
remarkable BP of 29.6%. For mutations involving
residues surrounding the BP, the average BP was
13.9% with a SD of 3%. Taking into account the
weight matrix (Figure 1) and experimental data, the
threshold for BP prediction was thus set at 67.

Auxiliary splicing sequences: enhancers and silencers
In order to simplify the interpretation of predictions
obtained with the diﬀerent algorithms using weight
matrices, we used a normalized range scale from 0 to
100. As a consequence, previous matrices from ESE-
Finder (19,27) were modiﬁed. Nevertheless the user can
deﬁne the thresholds using either the original ESE-
Finder range or the new 0–100 range. In addition, when
processing a single sequence and when CVs are available,
HSF calculates the deviation as a percentage of the
threshold. A reduced list can be obtained for each
matrix by choosing the ‘Only variant’ option in
‘Advanced parameters’. A color code is used for each
quartile (from white to orange) to simplify the analysis.
When comparing mutant sequences, HSF uses this color
code to indicate the diﬀerences between the two sequences.
When scalability is not possible, HSF only displays the
presence of a motif.
To evaluate the sensitivity and usefulness of auxiliary
splicing sequence predictions, we used a ﬁrst set of genes
for which 20 mutations have been reported to result
in exon skipping following targeting of ESE or ESS
(58–66). For each mutation, we selected the default
option that allows HSF to predict modiﬁcations of ESE
and/or ESS motifs using all available matrices (Table 4).
For mutation c.362C>T in ACADM or c.4250T>A in
DMD for which the target auxiliary sequences have been
experimentally characterized (SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1
respectively), HSF correctly predicted the eﬀect of the
mutation. For other sequences, diﬀerent scenarios
were predicted: (i) disruption of one or more ESE without
creation of an ESS, as observed for mutations c.882C>T
(MLH1), c.362C>T (ACADM), c.8165C>G and

(NF1) and c) intermediate situation where both the dis-

diﬀerentiate ‘true’ ESE or ESS motifs from false positive
signals, we selected a second set of 36 mutations (positive
controls) and 220 SNPs (negative controls)
(Supplementary Table 1). Predictions were classiﬁed in
three categories: disruption of ESE motifs only (ESE),
creation of ESS motifs only (ESS) or both (ESE+ESS).
In addition, results were classiﬁed in two subsets: a ﬁrst
one (All), which included all predicted motifs, and a
second one (Best), which was restricted to only one
motif for each case by selecting the one recognized by
the highest number of matrices.
Comparison of the three categories (ESE, ESS, and
ESE+ESS) revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
positive and negative controls both in the ‘All’
(2=10.05, P=0.00656) and the ‘Best’ subset
(2=11.75, P=0.0028). We then evaluated the potential
of each matrix to diﬀerentiate true from false positive
signals. No statistical diﬀerences were found using the
Sironi, PESS, IIE, hnRNPA1 and RESCUE-ESE
matrices. A statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found
for the ‘All’ subset (2=3.99, P=0.045), but not for
the ‘Best’ subset (2=2.47, P=0.116) with the EIE
matrix. Signiﬁcant results in both subsets were obtained
with ESE-Finder (‘All’ subset: 2=5.17, P=0.023; ‘Best’
subset: 2=7.33, P=0.0067), the 9G8 and Tra2ß matri-
ces from HSF (‘All’ subset: 2=9.92, P=0.00164; ‘Best’
subset: 2=9.86, P=0.00169) and PESE (‘All’ subset:
2=19.52, P=9.95 106; ‘Best’ subset: 2=13.52,
P=2.36 104). The positive (PPV) and negative
(NPV) predictive values as well as the sensitivity (Sv)
and the speciﬁcity (Sp) of these last three matrices were
then evaluated. PPV ranged from 0.22 (9G8 and Tra2ß) to
0.56 (PESE), PNV from 0.76 (PESE) to 0.95 (9G8 and
Tra2ß), Sv from 0.27 (PESE) to 0.40 (9G8 and Tra2ß)
and Sp from 0.88 (9G8 and Tra2ß) to 0.91 (PESE).
The ESE-Finder matrix showed intermediate values in
all cases.

During evolution from simple to higher eukaryotes, splic-
ing signals evolved from well-deﬁned motifs to degener-
ated sequences with the addition of new auxiliary splicing

sequences known as ESE and ESS. Although major SR
proteins have been cloned and their target sites deter-
mined, much work remains to be done to understand
how splice signals are recognized and splicing speciﬁcity
achieved. As this complex world is progressively revealed,
bioinformatics resources could play a major role in help-
ing researchers and diagnostic laboratories to evaluate the
consequence of mutations on splicing, especially because
most genetic tests use DNA and not RNA samples.
By giving an easy access to predictions of 50ss, 30ss, BP
sequences as well as ESE and ESS, the HSF tool (http://
www.umd.be/HSF/) fulﬁlls this need and may assist clin-
icians, geneticists and researchers (70–75). By combining
motifs identiﬁed with diﬀerent experimental and computa-
tional approaches, it provides a common interface that
can be used for sequence analysis. The inclusion of all
exons and introns extracted from the Ensembl human
genome database (20) allows an easy access to any
sequence of human genes and thus direct comparison of
virtually every mutation or SNP concerning splicing ele-
ments. Since SNPs are present at a very high frequency in
the genome (1/300 bp) it could be useful to evaluate their
impact in association with a mutation. We therefore
included in HSF data from dbSNP using Ensembl
Biomart. The user can select the ‘Search for SNPs related
to the analyzed sequence’ option that automatically
retrieves SNPs from the database. When SNPs are loca-
lized in exons, their eﬀect on ESE and ESS motifs could
help the user to better evaluate the consequence of a given
mutation.
To evaluate the eﬃciency of the various algorithms
included in HSF and its contribution to the prediction
of the consequences of mutations associated with a splic-
ing defect, we used a set of 69 intronic mutations that
disrupt the 50ss or the 30ss and result in exon skipping
and/or activation of a cryptic splice site (Table 1), and a
group of 15 mutations that were previously reported to
result in splicing defects by creating or activating cryptic
splice sites (Table 2). HSF was able to correctly predict the
disruption of the natural splice sites. Moreover, we could
conﬁrm that (i) mutations of the last nucleotide of an exon
have a strong eﬀect on the 50ss (CV=12%  0.7) result-
ing frequently in exon skipping or partial exonic deletion
or intronic retention due to activation of a cryptic splice
site; (ii) mutations of the penultimate exonic nucleotide
have limited consequences on the 50ss (CV=5.4% 
0.3), but they can activate a cryptic splice site, making
predictions more diﬃcult; (iii) exonic mutations distant
from the 50 and 30ss can activate a cryptic splice site lead-
ing to partial exonic deletion. Overall these ﬁndings under-
line the eﬃciency of the HSF algorithm to predict the
eﬀect of mutations on 50 and 30ss. When using the HSF
algorithm, the threshold for 50 and 30ss is 65 with a patho-
genic CV of 10% except for position +4 where it is
7%. However, in few cases when unusual splice sites are
used, this algorithm could be less eﬃcient.
BP sequences represent another essential splicing signal.
When a mutation is localized in proximity of the 50 of the
30ss, its potential eﬀect on a BP sequence should be exam-
ined especially when a nucleotide located at less than 85 bp
from the 30ss is targeted. In order to evaluate the HSF
algorithm dedicated to the identiﬁcation of BP sequences,
we used 14 BP sequences inactivated by intronic mutations
(Table 3). HSF correctly predicted 13 out of 14 BPs and
these data allowed us to deﬁne the threshold for BP detec-
tion at 67 and the pathogenic BP at 10%. Moreover,
for intron 3 of XPC, HSF predicted a BP at position 24.
However, according to Khan et al. (76), two BP sequences
are present in this intron, one at positions 24 and
another at –4. HSF could not predict the BP at position
4 simply because the HSF algorithm excludes positions
12 to 1 for BP identiﬁcation because of steric obstruc-
tion caused by the spliceosome.
It has been demonstrated that two diﬀerent splicing rec-
ognition mechanisms, correlated with intron length, can
be used in a cell: exon deﬁnition for long and exon deﬁ-
nition for short introns (77). Although the inﬂuence of
intron length seems to be less important in humans than
in other species, it should, nevertheless, be kept in mind
since U12 and U2-type introns have diﬀerent BP consen-
sus sequences. In the present version of HSF (v2.4), we
only focused on U2-type introns, which are by far the
most abundant type in mammalian cells.
Concerning cis-acting elements, many works have
been performed to deﬁne ESE and ESS matrices based
on bioinformatics or experimental approaches (78).
However, due to technical and/or conceptual bias, the var-
ious sequence sets only share partial homology. To solve
this problem, HSF included all available matrices in one
place. In addition, we developed new matrices to predict
ESE motifs for the 9G8 and Tra2-b SR proteins and ESS
motifs for the hnRNPA1 ribonucleoprotein. ESE and ESS
motifs frequently overlap and therefore the identiﬁcation
of the speciﬁc motif/protein pair involved in a given spli-
cing defect is diﬃcult. This is even more complicated
when considering the impact of SR and ribonucleoprotein
concentration in diﬀerent tissues or during development.
We used a set of 20 exonic mutations known to inﬂuence
splicing through ESE inactivation or ESS activation
(Table 4) to evaluate the eﬃciency of HSF to correctly
predict motifs disrupted by these mutations. We showed
that when the motif/protein pairs had been previously
experimentally characterized (hnRNPA1 or SF2/ASF),
HSF was able to correctly predict the eﬀects of the muta-
tion on ESE and ESS. For most mutations, however, only
the general mechanism was identiﬁed (i.e. the mutant
sequence inhibits splicing in various in vitro reporter sys-
tems) and therefore the motif/protein couple is unknown.
In these cases, HSF predicted the disruption of ESE motifs
and/or the creation of ESS motifs (Table 4). In addition,
to evaluate HSF eﬃciency to discriminate true from false
positive signals, we used a second group of positive and
negative controls (Supplementary Table 1). We showed
that both sets could be discriminated on the basis of
their overall pattern (ESE, ESS, ESE+ESS; 2=11.75,
P=0.0028). Three matrices also gave statistically signiﬁ-
cant results: ESE-Finder (2=7.33, P=0.0067), 9G8 and
Tra2ß from HSF (2=9.86, P=0.0017) and PESE
(2=13.52, P=2.36 104). Since these three matrices
predict ESE motifs, these results could be associated
with a bias towards the positive controls. Indeed, only
few experimental validations of auxiliary sequences are

available and they are frequently initiated by predictions
of ESE motifs using ESE-Finder. PESE and the 9G8/
Tra2ß HSF matrices gave stronger results than ESE
Finder itself and therefore can be considered eﬃcient
matrices for the identiﬁcation of ESE motifs. However,
predictions with other matrices, especially the hnRNPA1
matrix, should also be considered as they could provide
valuable information as shown for the c.4250T>A of
DMD. We are still in the early days of ESE and ESS
motif predictions and further data are needed to select
the best matrices and to deﬁne the rules for data interpre-
tation as most mutation sets used to validate prediction
tools contain mainly mutations aﬀecting splice sites (79).
Major work is also needed to ultimately address the tissue
or developmental speciﬁcity.
In conclusion, the HSF tool is dedicated to the predic-
tion of splicing signals present in any human gene using all
available matrices to identify ESE and ESS and new
matrices to evaluate 50 and 30ss and BPs. This tool is reg-
ularly updated to include new data from bioinformatics
and experimental studies in order to improve predictions.
Many users already have tested HSF and have stressed its
value both for basic science (identiﬁcation of splicing sig-
nals) and applied research or diagnostics (prediction of the
pathogenic consequences of a given mutation) (70–75).
In addition, new genotype-based therapies, such as the
exon-skipping approach in Duchenne Muscular
Dystrophy, are currently evaluated in clinical trials (inter-
national multi-center phase I/II clinical studies with
PRO051 in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
– Prosensa company; http://prosensa.eu/). HSF might rep-
resent an useful tool to identify key splicing sequences in
diﬀerent exons (75,80) and therefore to design antisense
oligonucleotides to induce exon skipping. This approach
is being actively evaluated throughout the world and espe-
cially by the TREAT-NMD European network (http://
www.treat-nmd.eu/home.php).
Besides these gene-speciﬁc approaches, global projects,
which either aim at developing a holistic view on
Genotype-To-Phenotype data (GEN2PHEN European
projects; http://www.gen2phen.org/) or at improving
health outcomes by facilitating the analysis of human
genetic variation and its impact on human health, such
as the Human Variome Project (81), might beneﬁt
from using HSF. Indeed, HSF could help to predict the
theoretical impact on splicing of any sequence variation
aﬀecting a human gene.
