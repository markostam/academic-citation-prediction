ABSTRACT
RNA secondary structures, e.g. stem–loops that are
often found at the 50 and 30 ends of mRNAs,are in many
cases known to be crucial for transcript stability but
their role in prolonging the lifetime of transcripts
remains elusive. In this study we show for an essential
RNA-stabilizing stem–loop at the 50 end of rbcL gene
transcripts inChlamydomonas that itneitherprevents
ribonucleases from binding to the RNA nor impedes
their movement along the RNA strand. The stem–loop
has a formative function in that it mediates folding of
a short sequence around its base into a specific RNA
conformation, consisting of a helical and single-
stranded region, i.e. the real structure required for
longevity of rbcL transcripts in chloroplasts. Disturb-
ing this structure renders transcripts completely
unstable, even if the sequence of this element is
not altered. The requirement of a specific 50 sequence
and structure for RNA longevity suggests an inter-
action of this element with a trans-acting factor
that protects transcripts from rapid degradation in
chloroplasts.
INTRODUCTION
Lifetimes of individual mRNA populations differ considerably
in cells, often ranging from a few minutes for short-lived
messages to several hours for stable transcripts (1,2). The
widespread occurrence of very short-lived mRNAs alongside
stable mRNAs shows that the ribonucleases responsible for
degradation of mRNAs are capable of degrading transcripts
rapidly and that long-lived mRNAs must have features that
protect them from ribonucleolytic attack and/or from imme-
diate degradation. Analyses of mRNA stability in prokaryotes
and eukaryotes show that key determinants of stability are
located predominantly in the 50- and 30-untranslated regions
(50- and 30-UTRs) of transcripts. In eukaryotes, elements
important for mRNA longevity have been delineated primarily
in the 30 regions of transcripts (3–5), whereas in prokaryote-
type mRNAs, i.e. bacterial and organelle mRNAs, essential
determinants of mRNA longevity seem to be located mostly
in the 50-UTR (6,7). Secondary structures at the 50 ends of
prokaryote-type mRNAs have been found to be important for
mRNA stability, examples being stem–loops at the 50 ends of
mRNAs in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis (8–10) and in
the 50-UTR of mRNAs in chloroplasts (11–13). Despite the
importance of these 50 secondary structures for mRNA lon-
gevity, their exact role in preventing rapid degradation of
transcripts has been difficult to assess, even though it is
often inferred that these structures function as binding sites
for proteins and/or as structural elements that bar ribonucle-
ases from attaching to and/or moving along the mRNA strand.
In this study, we examined in vivo the function of an essen-
tial RNA-stabilizing stem–loop that forms at the 50 end of
transcripts of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast rbcL gene.
After joining the 50 region of the rbcL gene to the coding
region of the bacterial uidA (GUS) gene, we altered the
sequence and secondary structure of the stem–loop in numer-
ous ways and measured accumulation of the resulting
transcript variants in Chlamydomonas chloroplast transfor-
mants in vivo. The analyses confirm that the 50-terminal
stem–loop is crucial for longevity of rbcL gene transcripts
in chloroplasts. However, even though essential for transcript
stability, the stem–loop is not the structure that shields
transcripts from attack or degradation by ribonucleases. The
stem–loop mediates folding of a previously identified
sequence element around its base into a specific RNA con-
formation that our analyses reveal to be the real structure
required for protection against degradation.

Center at Duke University, NC, USA. The light-sensitive
mutant was grown on a shaker in low light conditions
(0.05 mmol/s·m2) at room temperature in high salt (HS)
medium supplemented with potassium acetate (2.5 g/l) (14).
Photosynthetic transformants of CC-373 were grown in high
light (50 mmol/s·m2) on HS minimal medium in 200 ml
tubes in a temperature-controlled water bath at 32C. Water
bath cultures were mixed by continuous bubbling with 2%
CO2-enriched air.
Transformation of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast
All DNA constructs were cloned into a chloroplast transforma-
tion vector (see below) and precipitated onto 0.6 mm gold
particles for bombardment of mutant CC-373 via a particle
delivery system (PDS-1000/He; Bio-Rad) as described previ-
ously (15,16). Stable transformants were selected on HS agar
plates in high light and were screened for the presence of the
uidA gene and its transcripts by Southern and northern ana-
lyses (16). Only cell lines that were 80–100% homoplasmic
were used in the analyses.
Modifications at the 50 end of the rbcL 50-UTR
Complementary oligonucleotides (obtained from MWG
Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany), containing the sequence or
variants of the sequence between the SwaI and BspEI sites
of the rbcL 50-UTR (Figure 1), were annealed, phosphorylated
and ligated into the SwaI/BspEI sites of vector +157/SK+ (17)
using standard molecular biology techniques (18). The
constructs were released from +157/SK+ by digestion with
XhoI/XbaI and cloned into the XhoI/XbaI restriction sites
of transformation vector pCrc32 (19).
50 RNA secondary structures
The native secondary structure of the 50 end of transcripts of
the C.reinhardtii rbcL gene has been determined previously
by alkylation with dimethyl sulfate (20). The experimentally
determined structure is identical to the structure predicted
by version 3.0 of the mfold program (21). Secondary structures
shown in Figures 2–4 are the structures predicted by the mfold
server at the Burnet Institute (http://mfold.burnet.edu.au/)
using a temperature of 32C and the default settings on the
web server. In all cases, except for constructs 4 and 15, folding
with the mfold algorithm resulted in just one structure for
the rbcL 50 end. Structures for constructs 4 and 15 given in
Figures 2 and 4, respectively, are the most likely structures
predicted, i.e. the structures with the lowest free energy value.
All structures were re-drawn for uniform and space-saving
appearance in the figures. Most of the modified 50 structures
could be predicted without using RNA folding software. For
example, the sequence in construct 3 was designed in order to
restore the terminal stem–loop that has been destroyed by the
changes introduced into the sequence of construct 2. Similarly,
the 50 structures of transcripts from constructs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13 and 14 are easily predictable, when compared with the

accumulate to high levels in the chloroplast of
Chlamydomonas and are long-lived, having a half-life of
5 h (7). It has been shown previously (17) that the rbcL
50-UTR sequence does not contain a promoter element
because significant changes in the sequence of the UTR or
altering its distance to the basal promoter sequence located
around position10 relative to the start site of transcription do
not abolish transcription. Therefore, levels of GUS transcripts
shown in this study reflect essentially their stability in vivo.
In the following section, RNA gel blot (northern) analyses
are used to discern 50 RNA features that result in stable or
unstable transcripts. Compared with control levels, levels of
stable transcripts of the modified rbcL 50-UTR:GUS constructs
varied in these analyses. We attribute these variations in part to
differences in copy numbers of the reporter gene in transfor-
mants and to real variations in transcript longevity caused
by the sequence modifications. These deviations from control
levels were not quantified, nor were half-lives of stable tran-
script variants determined, as the main objective of the study
was to distinguish stable from extremely unstable transcripts,
i.e. transcripts that do accumulate from transcripts that do not
accumulate in chloroplast transformants, and not to distinguish
stable from less stable transcripts.
Requirement of a 50 stem–loop for RNA stability
Transcripts of the Chlamydomonas rbcL gene are predicted
to fold at their 50 end into two stem–loop structures that are
separated by a short single-stranded region (Figure 1). The
single-stranded region is part of a previously identified RNA-
stabilizing sequence (20) that extends by a few nucleotides on
each side into the bottom of both stem structures. The presence
of the predicted 50 structure has been verified in vivo by alky-
lation with dimethyl sulfate (20). Recent studies suggested that
the large 50-terminal stem–loop is crucial for stability of rbcL
transcripts in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast (17).
To investigate the RNA-stabilizing function of the
50-terminal stem–loop structure, a number of sequence vari-
ants of the rbcL 50-UTR were constructed (Figure 2A) that
either retained (constructs 4 and 6), destroyed (constructs 1, 2
and 5), or restored (construct 3) the stem–loop (Figure 2B)
without altering the total number of nucleotides in the 50-UTR.
Transcripts from these constructs accumulated in chloroplast
transformants only when the 50-terminal stem–loop could pos-
sibly form (Figure 2C; constructs 3, 4 and 6). In all cases in
which the nucleotide sequence did not allow folding into a
50-terminal stem–loop, transcripts of the GUS reporter gene
were below levels detectable by conventional northern blot
analysis. Unambiguous evidence for the requirement of a
50-terminal stem–loop for transcript stability comes from com-
paring the accumulation of GUS transcripts in transformants
carrying constructs 2 or 3. The changes introduced in construct
2 hinder formation of the native stem–loop structure, and
transformants carrying this construct do not accumulate
GUS transcripts (Figure 2B and C). Additional complementary
changes introduced in construct 3 restore the structure and
result in accumulation of transcripts.
Role of sequence and shape of the stem–loop
To find out whether the native terminal stem–loop of the rbcL
50-UTR can be replaced by a different stem–loop structure
regardless of sequence and shape, the size, the shape and
most of the nucleotide sequence of the stem–loop were altered
(Figure 3A and B). GUS transcripts accumulated in all trans-
formants carrying constructs with altered stem–loops
(Figure 3C) despite significant differences in their sequences,
size and shape. In construct 7 all the purine (A) and pyrimidine
(U, C) nucleotides between positions +6 and +36 were
replaced by alternative purine (G) and pyrimidine (C, U)
nucleotides. In construct 8 the sequence between positions
+5 and +37 was inverted. In both cases, the different stem–
loop sequences—that also result in slightly different shapes of
the terminal stem–loop—had no drastic effect on transcript
accumulation (Figure 3C). Extending the stem of the
50-terminal stem–loop by 3 bp (construct 9) or shortening it
by 3 bp (construct 10) did not prevent accumulation of GUS
transcripts indicating that the length of the stem is not crucial
for transcript stability. Finally, GUS transcripts accumulated
even when a large portion of the native 50-terminal stem–loop
was replaced with a short but perfect hairpin structure
(Figure 3B; construct 11) that has been shown to stabilize
transcripts in E.coli (22). These results essentially exclude
any specific role of the main portion of the stem–loop in
stabilizing transcripts in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast.
Formative function of the 50-terminal stem–loop
In all variants of the 50-terminal stem–loop described above,
the 4 bp at the bottom of the stem were deliberately left
untouched because previous studies have shown that single
nucleotide changes in this region render transcripts unstable
(20). The results presented above led us to conclude that any
50-terminal stem–loop structure suffices to stabilize transcripts
of the reporter gene in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast.
However, analyses of another set of reporter gene constructs
revealed that, even in the presence of a 50-terminal stem–loop,
transcripts fail to accumulate if the RNA conformation around
the base of the stem is disturbed (Figure 4). Swapping the
nucleotides at positions +1 to +4 with their complementary
nucleotides at positions +38 to +41 (Figure 4A; construct 12),
which changes the sequence but not the structure at the bottom
of the terminal stem–loop (Figure 4B), abolishes transcript
accumulation completely (Figure 4C). Deletion of the first
2 nt of the transcript, resulting in a shorter stem and altering
the conformation of the sequence at its base (construct 13),
also renders transcripts unstable. In this case, shortening the
stem can be excluded as a cause of degradation of the tran-
scripts because transcripts with a shorter stem at their 50 end
were even found to be stable (Figure 3; construct 10). Extend-
ing the 50-terminus of the transcripts by 5 nt that pair with nt
42–46 further downstream (construct 14) leads also to desta-
bilization of the transcripts, despite the presence of a stem–
loop at the 50-terminus that is more stable than its native
counterpart. It is important to note that the sequence and
conformation of the original stem–loop is contained in tran-
scripts of construct 14, these transcripts differing from control
transcripts only in the incorporation of nt 42–46 into a helical
conformation at the base of the stem–loop 14 (Figure 4B). As
shown by accumulation of transcripts from construct 15,
which adds six unpaired nucleotides to the RNA’s 50-terminus,
it is not the addition of nucleotides to the transcripts’ 50 end
that destabilizes transcripts of construct 14 but the

conformational change at the base of the stem–loop (Figure 4B
and C).
In conclusion, transcripts of chimeric [rbcL 50-UTR:GUS:
psaB 30 end] genes are stable in the chloroplast of C.reinhardtii
only when folding of the nucleotides around position +40 of
the 50-UTR into a specific conformation, consisting of a helical
and a single-stranded region, is possible. The 50-terminal
stem–loop contributes to folding of the RNA sequence into
this conformation by providing the helical portion of the spe-
cific secondary structure but, by itself, does not prevent RNA
degradation.
DISCUSSION
Identification of cis-acting elements in RNA sequences
Proper and accurate identification of cis-acting elements is a
prerequisite for further analyses of their role in gene expres-
sion. For RNA sequences, correct identification of cis-acting
elements should ideally be complemented with information on
their in vivo conformation because of the potential importance
of secondary structures for the function of the elements. Native
RNA secondary structures can be critical in in vivo and in vitro
assays, e.g. RNA mobility shift assays that are widely used to
determine interactions of RNA sequences with trans-acting
factors. Unless accompanied by additional analyses, deletions
and conventional cloning techniques, which often introduce
extra nucleotides into nucleic acid sequences, do not seem to
be adequate methods for locating precisely cis-acting elements
in RNA sequences. For example, without further analysis, the
nucleotides in positions +10 to +18 of construct 2 or positions
+6 to +9 of construct 5 (Figure 2) can easily be regarded to
belong to a cis-acting RNA-stabilizing element because alter-
ing these nucleotides destabilizes transcripts. Additional anal-
yses reveal (Figure 3) that these nucleotides have no specific
role in stabilization of transcripts. In light of these observa-
tions, we consider it possible that several of the cis-acting
elements found in RNA sequences to date do not have the
primary function ascribed to them. Revealing their true func-
tion requires analyses beyond deletions and a limited number
of mutations, which, however, in most cases may be very
difficult or impossible to perform.
Role of the 50-terminal stem–loop
The finding that chloroplast transcripts ending in a stable 50
stem–loop can be degraded rapidly (Figure 4; constructs 12, 13
and 14) implies that a 50-terminal stem–loop is generally not a
structural impediment for mRNA-degrading ribonucleases in
chloroplasts. This seems to be in contrast to the situation in
bacteria where 50-terminal stem–loop structures appear to have
a direct effect on ribonuclease binding and mRNA decay
(22,23). This study shows for the rbcL 50-terminal stem–
loop that its role is to provide a stable RNA secondary struc-
ture that places the bottom nucleotides of the stem and the
following nucleotides—those sequences corresponding to
a previously identified RNA-stabilizing sequence (20)—into
a specific RNA conformation, consisting of a helical and a
single-stranded portion, required for longevity of rbcL
transcripts in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast. This specific
sequence and structure requirement for stability of rbcL
transcripts strongly suggests an mRNA-stabilizing
mechanism that involves binding of a trans-acting factor to
this element.
Trans-acting factors and RNA longevity in chloroplasts
The existence of a number of nuclear mutants of
Chlamydomonas that fail to accumulate individual mRNA
populations in the chloroplast seems to support the idea of
protective transcript-specific RNA-binding proteins (24–27).
A couple of proteins that complement RNA stability mutants
have been isolated to date (28,29) but direct binding of these
proteins to a known stabilizing sequence in 50-UTRs could not
be demonstrated. In addition to proteins that complement RNA
stability mutants, several other proteins that bind to 50-UTRs
of chloroplast transcripts, either individually or as part of
multi-protein complexes, have been identified (30). Most of
these proteins appear to function primarily in translational
control of chloroplast gene expression although ancillary
roles in RNA stabilization cannot be excluded. Difficulties
in linking already known RNA-binding proteins directly to
cis-acting RNA-stabilizing sequences may be due to the
requirement of specifically folded 50 RNA secondary struc-
tures that may be hard to establish in in vitro RNA/protein
binding assays.
Considering the apparent lack of a sequence and a structural
consensus among 50 sequences of chloroplast mRNAs in gen-
eral, and in particular, among the cis-acting transcript-
stabilizing elements that have been delineated to date (20),
it appears possible that different chloroplast mRNA species
contain different sequences and structures at their 50 ends that
are involved in stabilizing transcripts. This would imply that
putative trans-acting factors that might bind to these elements
are also transcript-specific. These trans-acting factors may be
part of multi-protein complexes that are proposed to control
initiation of translation of transcripts (30,31) or be separate
entities that function independently of translation. Although
most models to date favor a coupled control of RNA stability
and translation (30), independent control of mRNA longevity
might occur in some mRNAs, e.g. transcripts of the atpB gene
(20), in which the distance between an RNA-stabilizing ele-
ment at the 50 end and the ribosome-binding site, around which
the proteins involved in translational regulation are supposed
to assemble, seems to exclude a direct interaction of trans-
acting factors associated with the two sites. Conceivably, inde-
pendent or relaxed control of translation and RNA stability
would allow more variability and flexibility in regulation of
gene expression than strict coupling of the two processes.
Regarding the differences in longevity of different mRNA
populations in chloroplasts, it appears feasible that inherent
differences in folding and stability of cis-acting RNA sec-
ondary structures and/or in binding of putative trans-acting
factors to these elements can be responsible for the differences
in lifetimes of transcripts in chloroplasts.
