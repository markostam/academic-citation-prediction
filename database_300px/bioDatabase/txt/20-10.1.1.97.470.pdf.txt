ABSTRACT
SwissRegulon (http://www.swissregulon.unibas.ch)
is a database containing genome-wide annotations
of regulatory sites in the intergenic regions of geno-
mes. The regulatory site annotations are produced
using a number of recently developed algorithms
that operate on multiple alignments of ortholo-
gous intergenic regions from related genomes in
combination with, whenever available, known sites
from the literature, and ChIP-on-chip binding data.
Currently SwissRegulon contains annotations for
yeast and 17 prokaryotic genomes. The database
provides information about the sequence, location,
orientation, posterior probability and, whenever
available, binding factor of each annotated site. To
enable easy viewing of the regulatory site annota-
tions in the context of other features annotated on
the genomes, the sites are displayed using the
GBrowse genome browser interface and can be
queried based on any annotated genomic feature.
The database can also be queried for regulons, i.e.
sites bound by a common factor.
INTRODUCTION
Regulation of the rate of transcription initiation is one of the
main mechanisms through which cells regulate the expression
of proteins encoded in their genomes. Transcription regula-
tion is generally implemented through the sequence-specific
binding of transcription factors (TFs) to target sites in the
DNA, which are most often in the intergenic region upstream
of the regulated gene.
The sequence segments recognized by TFs are generally
short, i.e. typically 20 bp for prokaryotic TFs and 10 bp
for eukaryotic TFs, and are normally degenerate. In spite
of decades of extensive experimental work the number of
experimentally known binding sites accounts only for a
small fraction of the total number of functional sites that
likely exist. For example, probably the most extensive data
are available for Escherichia coli with 1000 sites
that have experimental support (1), and for Sacchromyces
cerevisiae with a few hundred sites that have direct experi-
mental support (2). However, even for E.coli this constitutes
probably less than one-fifth of all binding sites that exist gen-
ome wide, and only about a third of the 300 TFs in E.coli
are represented with at least one binding site.
Computational approaches for inferring transcription factor
binding sites stretch back almost two decades (3–5). How-
ever, only with the recent advent of large numbers of fully
sequenced genomes, and the availability of genome-wide
gene expression and chromatin immuno precipitation data
has it become computationally feasible to comprehensively
annotate regulatory sites genome-wide. For example, several
approaches have been developed recently that identify regu-
latory sites by searching for significantly conserved sequence
segments within multiple alignments of orthologous inter-
genic regions of related genomes (6–11). In this context sev-
eral yeast species were sequenced recently (12,13) with the
aim of identifying regulatory sites genome-wide. In addition
to comparative genomic approaches large-scale ChIP-on-chip
experiments have been undertaken recently in yeast to deter-
mine the intergenic regions bound by over 100 TFs (14,15).
Computational approaches that combine comparative geno-
mic analysis of orthologous intergenic regions with the anal-
ysis of these large-scale ChIP-on-chip data have led to the
first comprehensive genome-wide annotations of binding
sites in yeast (11,15–17).
REGULATORY SITE ANNOTATION METHODS
The methods that we use to produce the regulatory-site
annotation for a given genome depend on the amounts and
kinds of data that are available for that organism. For most
organisms currently in SwissRegulon the only available data
consist of the sequence of the genome and the genome
sequences of related organisms. For these organisms our anno-
tations are based on a careful comparison of orthologous inter-
genic regions from sets of related organisms as described
below. For some genomes there are collections of known bind-
ing sites and we use these to build position-specific weight
matrices (WMs) that represent the sequence-specificities of

the TFs for which sites are available. For yeast there are also
comprehensive ChIP-on-chip binding data available and we
use these in combination with known sites to build a large
set of WM models of yeast TFs. We use these sets of WMs
to scan multiple alignments of orthologous intergenic regions
genome-wide using the algorithm MotEvo (16).
IRUS: Intergenic Regions Under Selection
At the time of writing there are 354 complete microbial geno-
mes that are available from the NCBI database (18). For all
but a handful of these genomes there are no known regulatory
sites, nor any ChIP-on-chip data available. However, for
almost any genome in this collection one can find a number
of related genomes that are close enough such that recogniz-
able sequence homology in intergenic regions remains, even
though a substantial fraction of nucleotides has been subs-
tituted since the common ancestor of the species. We have
developed an automated pipeline that, starting from such a
set of related genomes, predicts segments in intergenic
regions that are under selection genome-wide. The details
of this procedures, called IRUS, will be presented elsewhere.
Here we briefly list the main steps:
(i) We extract the genome sequences from GenBank (18)
and identify orthologous genes between all pairs of
species.
(ii) We reconstruct the phylogenetic tree relating the
species. We first estimate the tree topology from
multiple alignments of orthologous genes. Then we
determine all pairwise distances from aligned third
positions in 4-fold degenerate codons. Finally we fit the
pairwise distances to the tree topology to obtain the
branch lengths in the tree.
(iii) We construct multiple alignments of orthologous
intergenic regions using T-Coffee (19).
(iv) We scan all alignments for putative regulatory sites
using a probabilistic algorithm that explicitly models the
evolution of regulatory sites along the phylogenetic tree.
The algorithm returns posterior probabilities for each
segment to contain a regulatory site and we select a set
of segments with high posterior probability.
Note that the IRUS pipeline can be applied to any set of
related species for which genome sequences are available.
Reconstructing WMs from known sites and
ChIP-on-chip data
For E.coli and S.cerevisiae we reconstructed a set of WMs
from the known binding sites in regulonDB (1) and
SCPD (2) (http://egsigma.cshl.org/jian) by an automated
curation procedure using the PROCSE algorithm (20).
PROCSE is a probabilistic clustering algorithm that assumes
the input sequences derive from an unknown number of
unknown WMs and simultaneously partitions the sites into
subsets that derive from a common WM, and aligns the
sequences within the subsets. For each TF we also determined
the site-length that maximized the overall probability of the
data. For E.coli this curation lead to 97 WMs for 58 different
TFs and for S.cerevisiae to 67 WMs for 62 different TFs
and complexes of multiple TFs. Second, for S.cerevisiae
we used the extensive binding data from (15) to infer WMs
using the PhyloGibbs algorithm on alignments of orthologous
intergenic regions of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species
as described in Ref. (11). Finally we combined and hand-
curated the WMs resulting from the curation of the known
sites and the WMs obtained with PhyloGibbs. This led to a
total of 72 high confidence WMs, most of which correspond
to the binding motif of a given yeast TF, whereas a small
number correspond to the binding motif of a complex of
yeast TFs.
MotEvo
MotEvo is a newly developed algorithm which identifies
binding sites for a set of predefined WMs by scanning multi-
ple alignments of intergenic regions (16). MotEvo exhaus-
tively reports putative locations of binding sites and assigns
a posterior probability to each reported site. For E.coli we
ran MotEvo with the 97 curated WMs on multiple alignments
of orthologous intergenic regions from E.coli, Salmonella
typhi, Yersinia pestis KIM, Photorhabdus luminescens, and
Photobacterium profundum SS9. For this dataset MotEvo
reported 6237 putative sites in the E.coli genome, 1162 of
which have a posterior >0.5. For S.cerevisiae we ran MotEvo
with the 72 curated WMs on the multiple alignments of
orthologous intergenic regions of the Saccharomyces sensu
stricto species. For this dataset MotEvo reported over
85 000 putative sites, of which 57 000 have a posterior
probability >0.1 and 17 000 sites having a posterior proba-
bility >0.5. For each gene MotEvo was run on the multiple
alignment of intergenic regions from all species for which
orthologs were available. For genes for which none of the
other species have an ortholog MotEvo runs on the intergenic
region of the reference species only. For these cases MotEvo
effectively reduces to a WM matching algorithm.
DATABASE CONTENT
Currently the SwissRegulon database contains regulatory site
annotations for the following 18 organisms: S.cerevisiae,
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Brucella suis,
Burkholderia, Chlamydophila caviae, Corynebacterium
glutamicum, Ehrlichia canis, E.coli K12, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis, Prochlorococcus
marinus, Pseudomonas syringae, Ralstonia eutropha,
Rickettsia typhi wilmington, Staphylococcus aureus, Strepto-
coccus pneumoniae and Vibrio cholerae. Our regulatory site
annotations are shown in the context of the general genome
annotations provided for each of these organisms. For all
organisms except for yeast the genome annotations were
obtained from GenBank (18). For S.cerevisiae the genome
annotation, which is significantly more extensive, was
obtained from the Saccharomyces genome database (SGD)
(ftp://ftp.yeastgenome.org/yeast/; 21).
For all organisms except E.coli and S.cerevisiae the
annotated regulatory sites are based on IRUS predictions
only. For each site the genomic location, strand, sequence
and the posterior probability as given by IRUS is recorded
in the database. The number of regulatory sites predicted
by IRUS varies from 750 sites for E.canis to 14 000
sites for Burkholderia. For E.coli and S.cerevisiae regulatory
site annotations of MotEvo are given in addition to the IRUS
D128 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue
predictions. For these regulatory sites the binding TF is also
identified for each site. In addition, the database contains WM
logos and regulons, i.e. lists of all annotated sites sorted by
posterior probability for each TF. Finally, for S.cerevisiae
the database also displays the experimentally determined
binding sites from SCPD (2) and regulatory site annotations
(15,17) that were downloaded from SGD. All genome-wide
binding site annotations are available as flat files in gff
format from the download section. For E.coli and S.cerevisiae
we also provide flat files of the WMs that are used in the
annotations.
DATABASE USE
The SwissRegulon database can be accessed at the address:
http://www.swissregulon.unibas.ch. The database uses the
Generic genome browser (GBrowse) (22) as an engine and
is fully compatible with the original GBrowse. For a detailed
description of GBrowse usage and features please see the
original manual at the developers page (http://www.gmod.
org/gbrowse). Briefly, the genome browser graphically
displays a section of the genome and all features annotated
on it. The user can zoom in and out and scroll through the
genome and click on features to obtain more detailed
information.
Users can specify a genome segment for displaying,
e.g. chrII:600..1000, or query the database by entering a
keyword including wild card characters, e.g. SKO*. This
query will return a list of matches to the search term. For
example, to find all annotated binding sites for the transcrip-
tion factor RAP1 one would query the database for RAP1*
(note that, beyond the binding sites this query would also
return the RAP1 gene). By clicking on one of the sites in
the list the user will see the section of the genome where
the site occurs.
Annotated regulatory sites are displayed as rectangular
boxes with an arrow inside showing the strand of the site.
The posterior probability assigned to the site is represented
by the intensity of the box’s color. That is, the higher the
posterior probability, the more intense is the color of the
box. Every box is labeled by an identifier which is either
the name of the TF that binds the site or a unique identifier
if the site has not been assigned to any known TF.
An example screen shot is shown in Figure 1. Placing the
cursor on the box brings up a pop-up legend with the
sequence of the site and its posterior probability. Clicking
on a binding site box links to a page with detailed information
about the site. For binding sites assigned to a TF this informa-
tion includes the ‘regulon list’ of all sites for the same TF,
and a logo of its WM. The regulon list shows for each site
in the regulon the name(s) of the upstream gene(s) it regu-
lates, the genomic coordinates of the intergenic region in
which it occurs, the genomic coordinates of the site, and
the posterior probability of the site. For convenient browsing
the user can filter out sites according to their posterior proba-
bility. Filters are accessible under the ‘Results and Analysis’
pop-up menu.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING RESOURCES
There are a number of databases that collect known TF bind-
ing sites from the literature. Most of these focus on regulatory
sites from a single organism, e.g. RegulonDB for E.coli (23),
SCPD for S.cerevisiae (2) and the more recent regulatory site
annotations based on ChIP-on-chip data (15,17), DBTBS for
B.subtilis (24), AGRIS for Arabidopsis thaliana (25), and the
DNase I footprint database for Drosophila melanogaster (26).
Similarly, there are a number of databases that contain known
binding sites in vertebrate genomes (27–29). The well-known
commercial TRANSFAC database (30) probably contains the
Figure 1. Screen shot from the SwissRegulon database for the intergenic region between the genes FKH1 and YIL130W in S.cerevisiae. Only sites with posterior
probability 0.7 or larger are shown.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue D129
largest collection of experimentally determined binding sites
from multiple organisms, mainly from eukaryotic organisms.
Finally, the PRODORIC database (31) focuses on prokaryotic
genomes and contains collections of known binding sites
from a number of bacteria, with E.coli, B.subtilis, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa represented by a substantial num-
ber of sites. Most of these databases also contain WMs for
the TFs for which known sites are available (32). Some of
the databases also offer the possibility of scanning intergenic
regions with these WMs, and in some cases to filter the resul-
ting sites for conservation in related species. Additionally,
databases and web servers have been made available that
show the results of ‘phylogenetic footprinting’ methods
(33–35), i.e. that display conservation profiles for particular
sets of related genomes.
Over the last years we have developed a number of
probabilistic methods (11,16,20) for rigorously combining
information from known binding sites and ChIP-on-chip
data with motif finding methods, and phylogenetic footprint-
ing. By applying these methods we obtain genome-wide
regulatory site annotations across different genomes using a
unified methodology, which rigorously assigns quality
estimates, i.e. posterior probabilities, to all predicted sites.
The main aim of SwissRegulon is to make these regulatory
site annotations available across as many genomes as possi-
ble, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. In addition we make
all the annotations available using a common GBrowse
genome browser interface that shows the binding sites in
the context of other features annotated on the genome.
Through this user-friendly graphical interface the SwissRegu-
lon resource will be useful for people researching regulatory
mechanisms both experimentally and computationally.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
In the near future SwissRegulon will significantly expand the
number of organisms represented, especially bacterial ones.
For the bacteria for which significant collections of known
sites exist, e.g. B.subtilis and P.aeruginosa, we will include
these into the predictions as currently done for E.coli. Even-
tually we also intend to include comprehensive regulatory site
annotations for higher eukaryotes, i.e. vertebrate genomes,
flies and worms.
Second, we are intending to incorporate ChIP-on-chip data
in the SwissRegulon database in the near future. The combina-
tion between the binding site annotations and condition-
specific ChIP-on-chip data will give insight into the conditions
under which different sites are bound by their TFs.
Third, currently binding sites are shown on a per genome
basis even though site conservation across related organisms
is used in the predictions. In the future we intend to provide
explicit information about conservation for each binding site
and to link each binding site to the orthologous binding sites
in the related genomes.
Finally, we have recently implemented a web server
(http://www.phylogibbs.unibas.ch) for running the Phylo-
Gibbs motif and regulatory site finding algorithm (11). In
the future we intend to integrate these two resources. This
will allow users to run PhyloGibbs on input data that was
selected in the genome browser, and to see the results in
the context of the existing regulatory site annotations.
