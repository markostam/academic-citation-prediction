ABSTRACT
We have developed the database TMFunction,
which is a collection of more than 2900 experimen-
tally observed functional residues in membrane pro-
teins. Each entry includes the numerical values for
the parameters IC50 (measure of the effectiveness
of a compound in inhibiting biological function),
Vmax (maximal velocity of transport), relative activity
of mutants with respect to wild-type protein, bind-
ing affinity, dissociation constant, etc., which
are important for understanding the sequence–
structure–function relationship of membrane pro-
teins. In addition, we have provided information
about name and source of the protein, Uniprot and
Protein Data Bank codes, mutational and literature
information. Furthermore, TMFunction is linked to
related databases and other resources. We have
set up a web interface with different search and dis-
play options so that users have the ability to get the
data in several ways. TMFunction is freely available
at http://tmbeta-genome.cbrc.jp/TMFunction/.
INTRODUCTION
Membrane proteins perform a diverse variety of functions
and are used as main drug targets of pharmaceutical
agents. The collection of information on potential amino
acid residues for the function of membrane proteins is
important for understanding the sequence–structure–func-
tion relationship of membrane proteins as well as predict-
ing the functional residues from sequence/structure.
Tusnady et al. (1) constructed a database for transmem-
brane proteins, which covers the three-dimensional
structures of membrane proteins deposited in Protein
Data Bank (PDB) and information on membrane spann-
ing a-helices and b-strands obtained with the TMDET
algorithm (2). Saier et al. (3) developed a comprehensive
classiﬁcation system for membrane transport proteins
known as the Transport Classiﬁcation Database
(TCDB). Further, functional databases have been devel-
oped for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPGRs), human
seven transmembrane receptors, Arabidopsis integral
membrane proteins and so on (4,5). Edvardsen et al. (6)
created a G-protein-coupled receptor mutant database,
which is mainly focused on diﬀerent families of GPCRs.
Mutational databases have also been developed for the
structure, function and thermodynamics of proteins (7,8).
On the other hand, several methods have been proposed
for discriminating transmembrane a-helical and b-strand
proteins, predicting their membrane-spanning segments,
and functional classiﬁcation of membrane proteins
(9–16). In spite of these studies, there is no database avail-
able for the broad collection of potential residues,
which are important for the functions of diﬀerent classes
of membrane proteins including receptors, transporters,
channel proteins, etc. This information can be obtained
from experimental studies on membrane proteins that
have reported the measured values of several parameters
for membrane protein function. The collection of such data
is important and necessary for analyzing and predicting
potentially important residues for practical applications.
In this work, we have developed a database,
TMFunction, which is a collection of more than 2900
experimental data about important amino acid residues
in membrane proteins, reported in the literature. It has
information about functionally important residues,
numerical values for the parameters IC50, Vmax, activity,
aﬃnity, etc., along with sequence and structure informa-
tion for the protein, mutational and literature informa-
tion. This database will help in understanding the
relationship between amino acid sequences/structures
and functions of membrane proteins. We have developed
a WWW interface to facilitate searching the database and
displaying the results with diﬀerent options.

CONTENTS OF THE DATABASE
Each entry in the database includes the following
information:
Sequence and structure information: name and source
of the protein, Uniprot (17) and PDB (18) codes, type of
the integral membrane protein (a-helical or b-strand),
mutational details (single, double or wild-type; muta-
tion has been identiﬁed with mutated residue, residue
number and mutant residue; e.g. A102V) and location of
mutants.
Functional information: factors that are mainly aﬀected
by the mutation of amino acid residues in membrane
proteins, such as relative activity of mutants, aﬃnity for
binding, channel, drug, glycosylation, membrane inser-
tion, cellular signaling, membrane translocation, trans-
port, etc.
Functional data: numerical values for aﬃnity (%), Bmax,
IC50, drug sensitivity, Kd, Km, Vmax, uptake (%), etc.
Experimental methods and conditions: measurement,
method and the ligand used for the control data.
Literature information: keywords, reference, authors
and remarks.
DATABASE STATISTICS
The ﬁrst release of TMFunction contains 2907 entries
from 83 diﬀerent proteins, which perform 29 diverse func-
tions. It has data for 2092 single mutants, 580 multiple
mutants and 273 wild-types. The majority of the data con-
cerns transmembrane helical proteins (2760) followed by
b-barrel membrane proteins (147). The data are obtained
from more than 100 scientiﬁc articles published in 20 dif-
ferent journals.
FEATURES OF TMFUNCTION
TMFunction includes several features in the search and
display options as shown in Figure 1, and as brieﬂy
explained subsequently:
(i) Retrieving data for a particular protein and/or
source.
(ii) Specifying the type of the mutant as single, multiple
and/or wild-type.
(iii) Selecting the function of the protein (transport) as
well as the numerical value of the functional param-
eter (e.g. IC50).
(iv) Mentioning the type of the protein.
(v) Extracting data by authors, publication year and
keywords.
(vi) Downloading entire data.
Detailed tutorials describing the usage of TMFunction
are available at the home page. For example, the data
obtained for the function ‘drug’ and single mutants
is shown in Figure 1a. The terms: entry, protein,
Uniprot ID, mutation, parameter, data, function, experi-
ments and Pubmed ID have been selected for display-
ing the results (Figure 1b). Figure 1c shows the ﬁnal
results obtained with the search conditions and display
options.
LINKS TO OTHER DATABASES
Each entry in TMFunction is linked to Uniprot ID (http://
www.uniprot.org/) and PDB code (http://www.rcsb.org)
to obtain the sequence and structure information directly.
The references for all data are directly connected to the
PUBMED literature database of NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). Further, we have pro-
vided links to several related databases and web servers
including sequences and structures, functions and gen-
omes, transmembrane helix and strand predictions
(http://tmbeta-genome.cbrc.jp/TMFunction/
DBlinkspage.html).
