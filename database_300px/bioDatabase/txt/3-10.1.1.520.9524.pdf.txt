ABSTRACT
The behaviour of the d(GGTATACC) oligonucleotide
has been investigated by X-ray crystallography at
295 K in the range from ambient pressure to 2 GPa
(20 000 atm). Four 3D-structures of the A-DNA form
(at ambient pressure, 0.55, 1.09 and 1.39 GPa) were
refined at 1.60 or 1.65 A˚ resolution. In addition to
the diffraction pattern of the A-form, the broad
meridional streaks previously explained by occluded
B-DNA octamers within the channels of the crystal-
line A-form matrix were observed up to at least
2 GPa. This work highlights an important property of
nucleic acids, their capability to withstand very high
pressures, while keeping in such conditions a nearly
invariant geometry of base pairs that store and carry
genetic information. The double-helix base-paired
architecture behaves as a molecular spring, which
makes it especially adapted to very harsh condi-
tions. These features may have contributed to the
emergence of a RNA World at prebiotic stage.
INTRODUCTION
Nucleic acids are more plausible than proteins as the
components of a self-contained replicating system in the
very ﬁrst stages of the emergence of life on Earth (1–3).
Watson–Crick base pairing provided a very plausible
mechanism by which a polynucleotide could direct the
synthesis of its complement from mononucleotides or
short oligonucleotides, while no equivalent mechanism is
known for the replication of a polypeptide. The discovery
of ribozymes (4,5) and then the demonstration that
ribosomal peptide synthesis is a ribozyme-catalysed
reaction (6) strengthened the case for an early RNA
World. In this context, the central problem for origin-
of-life studies is to understand how this seminal world
became established on the primitive Earth. Plausible
scenarios for the prebiotic chemistry have been proposed
(7,8), but the problem is far from being solved. A
recurrent theme is that RNA may have emerged from an
earlier world under extreme conditions of pressure and/or
temperature and pH (8). In all scenarios, molecules
with backbones forming stable double helices held
together by Watson–Crick base pairing appear as crucial
intermediates or crucial building blocks. This fact led us
to undertake a programme on the behaviour of such
molecules under high pressure.
Some studies were recently devoted to the analysis of
the eﬀects of high hydrostatic pressures on the stability
of living cells (9–11), the quaternary structures of proteins
and viruses (12), protein–protein and protein–DNA
interactions (13), catalytic RNA (14) and tRNA (15).
Concerning nucleic acids, they were investigated through
their single-strand/duplex equilibrium (16), their B/Z
transition (17) and their hydration networks (18) all
using spectroscopic techniques in solution. Following
Le Chatelier’s principle, pressure tends to favour states
with smaller speciﬁc volumes. In DNA, structural
adaptation to high pressure results from several contribu-
tions, including the helical structure integrity (helix-to-coil
transition), the stacking of bases, the Watson–Crick
association and the hydration network around the
duplex. Aromatic-ring stacking is favoured by pressure
while Coulombic or hydrophobic interactions are

disfavoured (19). Hydrogen bonds and associated
networks should be, as in protein and protein assemblies
(20–22), stabilized by pressure. How these various
parameters inﬂuence the structure and stability of the
DNA duplex is not easy to predict. Clearly, besides
spectroscopic data, accurate 3D structures were required
in order to describe the behaviour under high pressure at
the molecular level and provide a ﬁrm starting point for
simulations. With respect to pioneering work based on
high-pressure beryllium cell (23), our technical develop-
ments combining diamond anvil cell and synchrotron
radiation of ultrashort wavelength (24) have considerably
extended the possibilities of high-pressure macromolecular
crystallography (HPMX) in a pressure range increased by
one order of magnitude (from 0.2 to 2 GPa). After studies
on monomeric (20), then multimeric (25) proteins and
a complex protein assembly (21), this article reports the
ﬁrst application of HPMX to nucleic acids.
The d(GGTATACC) oligonucleotide was selected
owing to the high stability of its crystalline A-DNA
crystalline form, its strong base stacking (2.9 A˚ compared
to the 3.3 A˚ in B-DNA duplex), and its particularly well-
deﬁned hydrogen-bonding network, mostly located in the
major groove (26). The last reason for this choice is
an interesting feature related to the crystal packing of
d(GGTATACC) crystals. Besides Bragg reﬂections of the
A-form crystal, a pattern was observed on diﬀraction
pictures of nucleotide crystals, similar to ﬁbre diagrams
that led Watson and Crick to their interpretation of
the DNA structure (27). Main features of this pattern
include a characteristic diﬀuse crossed X-ray pattern,
a set of streaks perpendicular to the c direction of the
reciprocal lattice and two strong elongated meridian
reﬂections (28). The following interpretation for the
origin of this pattern was proposed (28). Oligonucleotide
molecules pack in inﬁnite super-helices of duplexes down
the 6-fold axis of the P61 space group (26). The central
channel of the super-helix can trap oriented molecules of
DNA. Simulations of streaks allow excluding the A-form
for occluded molecules and favour the B-form. The
meridional reﬂections are consistent with the base-pair
stacking in B-form molecules. According to these results,
we have in hand a system in which both A and B forms of
DNA can be simultaneously monitored against external
hydrostatic pressure, although information derived on the
B-form is obviously quite limited.
Crystals of the nucleotide were compressed up to 2GPa
at 295K. We describe the high-resolution crystal struc-
tures of A-DNA at four pressures from ambient to
1.39GPa. Meridional streaks attributed to B-DNA are
observed up to at least 2GPa. These results highlight
the remarkable adaptation of the base-paired double-helix
architecture base-paired architecture to high pressure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation and crystallization
The d(GGTATACC) sequence was synthesized by stan-
dard phosphoramidite chemistry on solid support
(Applied Biosystems 391 DNA Synthetizer). Crystals
were obtained following the batch method (26). Ten
milligrams of lyophilized octamer were dissolved in 200 ml
of a 15% methyl-pentane-diol (MPD) solution, buﬀered
by sodium cacodylate (5 102M, pH 7) and containing
additives: sodium azide, spermine tetrahydrochloride
and MgCl2. To this solution, was added each day 5 ml of
the same solution but containing 50% of MPD, followed
by a rapid mixing. After 5 days, crystals began to appear
as elongated hexagonal rods and grew easily to a size
of 0.20.2 1.0mm3 in a week. They were stabilized by
increasing the ﬁnal MPD concentration to 35%.
High-pressure cell
Crystals were hydrostatically compressed in a diamond
anvil cell. The compression chamber (diameter 400mm,
height 200 mm) was drilled in a copper or stainless steel
(for pressure above 0.7GPa) gasket (Figure 1). Gasket
preparation and sample loading were performed as
described (24). The crystallization solution with 35%
MPD was used as compression medium. Pressure
monitoring was performed by using the wavelength shift
of laser-excited ﬂuorescence from a small ruby sphere
loaded in the compression chamber. Two diﬀerent
diamond anvil cells were used for data collection. The
ﬁrst one had a useful aperture of 628 and a standard
diamond mount (24). The second one was of a novel
design to provide both a larger useful aperture (828) and
a pressure range up to 2.5GPa (29).
Data collection
Diﬀraction data from crystals compressed in the diamond
anvil cell were collected at the ESRF (Grenoble, France),
on the ID27 beamline with a MAR CCD 165mm
detector. The wavelength was calibrated and set to
0.3738 A˚ (Iodine K absorption edge). Four data sets
were collected at room temperature and ambient pressure,
0.55, 1.04 and 1.39GPa. The crystal-to-detector distance,

calibrated using the diﬀraction rings of a reference silicon
powder, was 352.9mm for the 0.55 GPa data set and
302.9mm for the others. The X-ray beam was collimated
to 50 50 mm2. Exposure times were 30 or 45 s, depending
on the sample, for a rotation step of 18. As data collection
was performed at room temperature, crystals were
translated several times, every 10 to 358 of rotation,
during exposure in order to irradiate fresh zones (24).
Data processing
Diﬀraction frames were integrated using XDS (30). All
data were independently put on an absolute scale using
SCALA (31).
Refinement
The starting molecular model was either the deposited
coordinates ref. 115D (26) or 1VJ4 (32) from the Protein
Data Bank. In the case of 115D, the isomorphous
di-bromo derivative of 1VJ4, thymine residues were
reconstructed from original bromo-uracils and all water
molecules were removed. A ﬁrst round of rigid body
reﬁnements was done with AMoRe (33), then reﬁnements
proceeded at the maximum resolution with individual
isotropic thermal factors and bond distance and angle
restraints, as used in SHELXL (34). Water molecules were
localized during the course of reﬁnement cycles by
analysing density peaks in FoFc Fourier diﬀerence
maps. They were accepted when they met standard
criterions like correct bond distances and angles toward
polar atoms of the model, and B thermal factors below
a given threshold arbitrarily ﬁxed to 65 A˚2. All analyses
of the geometric parameters were done using NEWHEL93
(35). All molecular ﬁgures were created using the program
PyMol (http://pymol.sourceforge.net/).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Single crystals of d(GGTATACC) were gradually com-
pressed from atmospheric pressure to 2GPa (Figure 1).
Unit cell parameters of the A-DNA crystal were measured
at each step of the pressure ramp from diﬀraction data
recorded over a rotation range of 28. In spite of the
elongated (anisotropic) shape of the DNA cylinder, they
decrease isotropically up to a pressure value of 1.5GPa.
The isothermal compressibility of the crystal is deﬁned
as =1/V(@V/@P)T, where V is the unit-cell volume.
The variation of V is shown in Figure 2. Least-squares
ﬁt up to 1.5GPa is V(P)=V(1)+ k1.exp(k2.P) with
V(1)=62290 A˚3, k1=11030 A˚3 and k2=1.25GPa1.
The derived isothermal compressibility is (P)=V1. k1.
k2. exp(k2.P). The largest value is at ambient pressure
(0=0.215GPa
1). We recall that the compressibility of
bulk water is 0.35GPa1; the compressibility of water in
the vicinity of polar atoms is similar to that of an ‘ice-like’
structure, 0.18GPa1 (36). The mean value of (P)
between ambient pressure and 1.5GPa is 0.088GPa1,
similar to the compressibility of tetragonal hen egg-white
lysozyme crystal (23,24). Above 1.6GPa, the cell volume
increases (the compressibility is negative) and the crystal
quality, as monitored by mosaicity and resolution of
diﬀraction data, gradually deteriorates. The diﬀraction
that extends to 1.6 A˚ at ambient pressure falls oﬀ to 3 A˚
at 1.8GPa and is completely lost at 2.0GPa. Four
high-resolution structures of the A-DNA form were
determined at ambient pressure, 0.55, 1.04 and 1.39GPa.
In each case, one or two crystals were suﬃcient to acquire
high-completeness data (Table 1) in spite of data collec-
tion at room temperature. Reﬁnements were performed
at 1.60–1.65 A˚ resolution to R-factors (R-free factors)
of 15.2 (19.1), 16.9 (20.1), 19.3 (22.7) and 18.8 (22.6)%,
respectively (Table 2).
The overall duplex structures shown in Figure 3
evidence axial compression of the helix, which reacts
to pressure like a molecular spring. The base-stacking
shrinkage is 2.6 A˚ for the full octamer length (from23.5 A˚ at
ambient pressure to 20.9 A˚ at 1.39GPa, i.e. a relative
contraction of 11%). The average base-pair step varies
from 2.92 A˚ down to 2.73 A˚ (Figure 4). This spectacular
plasticity associates only small changes in phosphodiester
backbone angles for accounting the denser base stacking.
The sugar puckering parameters (Taum and P) describ-
ing the sugar conformations were analysed. All of them
belong to the canonical C30endo (or northern) conforma-
tion, a behaviour already mentioned earlier (26). The
pseudo-rotation P remains remarkably constant over the
whole pressure range between standard values of 1 to
308, including the O30 end sugar of chain A, which moves
from 30.9 to 33.38. The only exception is the O30 end
sugar of chain B that adopts at ambient pressure a C20/
C10 twist (nearly a southern conformation) and goes
back to 36.88 (northern) at 1.04GPa and above.
The variation of base-pair spacing versus pressure
(Figure 4) is approximately linear up to 1.0GPa and
becomes steady beyond, which means that the molecule
becomes progressively unable to accommodate increasing
compression. The gradual degradation of the crystal order
beyond 1.6GPa may be due, at least partly, to this eﬀect.

Contrary to common B-DNA crystal packing arrange-
ments, where duplexes stack on the top of each others
building inﬁnite helices along crystal axes, the hexagonal
packing of d(GGTATACC) builds inﬁnite super-helices
around the 6-fold crystallographic axis with a close-
contact zone between neighbouring helices (26,28). In this
region, the wedge eﬀect of hydrostatic pressure produces
a hinge point in base stacking between the ﬁfth and the
sixth base pairs (Figure 5). This steric eﬀect might also
contribute to crystal degradation.
The Watson–Crick type of base-pair association, which
represents the foundation of the genetic code transmis-
sion, could be another way for the helix to ‘breathe’
transversally. In proteins, in the elastic compression
regime, salt bridges and H-bond lengths are usually
shortened by 0.1 A˚.GPa1 (20–22). In the case of
A-DNA, evolutions of polar atom distances within G–C
and A–T base pairs (Table 3) can be interpreted in terms
of small variations of rise, buckle, propeller-twist and
other parameters that contribute to the adaptation to high
pressure (Table 4). Accordingly, the geometry of Watson–
Crick base pairings remains essentially invariant in the
pressure domain up to 1.39GPa. The lengths of vectors
C10–C10, that may be used to quantify the DNA cylinder
transversal squeeze, are all identical within their SDs,
i.e. 10.5(2) A˚, whatever the applied pressure.
It was suggested from modelling and docking simula-
tions that water hydration under high hydrostatic pressure
would tend to build octahedral arrangements (17) around
DNA, to account for a negativeiV. These arrangements
have been invoked in the B/Z transition observed under
high pressure (15). The A-form of DNA shows a heavily
hydrated major groove and a poorly hydrated minor
groove. These features are distinct with respect to other
DNA forms, and as such are worth to be investigated
under pressure. The hydration scheme of d(GGTATACC)

has been extensively analysed because it presents regular
pentagonal arrangements (26) in the major groove
(Figure 6), a typical motif also observed in some well-
ordered proteins at atomic resolution such as crambin
(37). The particular conformation of the A-form of DNA
allows water molecules to directly bridge phosphate
groups along each individual strand. At ambient pressure,
75 direct polar contacts are established through 51 water
molecules belonging to the ﬁrst shell of hydration,
including nine over the 12 possible phosphate bridges.
As mentioned earlier, the remaining water molecules
build an ordered network from rim to rim thus completely
ﬁlling most of the available space in the major groove.
Under pressure, more water sites become apparent. This
is illustrated in Figure 7, which shows the same G–C base
pair at one end of the duplex superimposed to the 2FoFc
electron-density maps calculated at diﬀerent pressures.
At 0.55 GPa, the number of observed isolated peaks in the
ﬁrst shell of hydration increases to 69, although some of
them were suspected not to correspond to water sites as
they ﬁll parts of elongated electron densities that cannot
be connected to the model. When pressure is increased
above 1.04GPa, one of the elongated densities resolves as
a linear chain, ideally ﬁtting a folded spermine molecule.
The stabilization of the hydrogen-bond network is made
evident by a slow but continuous decrease of the average
normalized Bih i thermal factor of water molecules
common to all structures (Table 2) down to a limit of
34 A˚2. The number of direct polar contacts from the ﬁrst
shell of hydration to the oligomer also increases rapidly
with pressure up to 0.55GPa, then more slowly up to
1.39GPa. Beyond 1GPa, the ﬁrst shell of hydration is
gradually compressed thus leading to more direct contacts
towards the DNA (Table 2). Nevertheless, the pentagonal
network located in the major groove remains conserved
in the whole pressure range.
The four X-ray data sets were recorded with exposure
times appropriate for collecting the A-form diﬀraction
data but too short to get a complete picture of the diﬀuse
scattering pattern described in (28). The series of narrow
streaks distributed in the pattern of a cross was barely
observable, but the extended meridional streaks associated
with the base-pair stacking were clearly observed up to at
least 2GPa. According to the interpretation given in (28),
the diﬀuse scattering pattern is produced by occluded
B-DNA molecules in the packing channels of the A-DNA
crystal structure. A suitable orientation of crystals in
the high-pressure cell allowed us to record these meridio-
nal streaks (Figure 8) while ramping pressure, which
provided data to determine the average stacking distance.
A continuous and smooth shortening is observed, that
can be monitored even in the range 1.5–2GPa where the
A-DNA crystal order falls oﬀ (Figure 4). The average
base-pair step is 3.34 A˚ at ambient pressure and 3.07 A˚
at 2GPa.
CONCLUSION
We have shown that d(GGTATACC) in the crystalline
A-form can withstand very high pressures, up to
1.9GPa. The gradual loss of long-range order between
1.6 and 1.9GPa may be related partially or completely to
packing eﬀects as mentioned previously and the molecule
in solution might be stable even beyond 1.9GPa. The four
high-resolution structures show that geometry of base
pairs is well preserved under compression up to at least
1.39GPa. The B-form molecules occluded in channels
of the crystal packing are in a solution-like environment.
The information derived on this form from diﬀuse
scattering is limited. Nevertheless, the smooth variation
of the period of stacking derived from the evolution of
meridian streaks reveals that the B-form is probably stable
up to at least 2GPa. We shall consolidate and extend
this preliminary result by performing another single-
crystal study on a dodecanucleotide that crystallizes in
the B-DNA form.

The remarkable adaptation of d(GGTATACC) to high
pressure is clearly associated to the base-paired double-
helix topology of the molecule, by which it behaves as
a molecular spring. These properties are probably shared
by molecules featuring similar topology, with sugar-
phosphate or polypeptide backbones. At the prebiotic
stage, the base-paired double-helix architecture was
crucial in the emergence of molecules with catalytic
properties and able to store genetic information. Such
architectures could withstand not only pressure in the
deepest sea trenches but also much higher pressures found
in Earth’s interior or in the context of rare events such as
impact of a meteorite. We suggest that this remarkable
adaptation to harsh conditions may have played an
important role during the sequence of events that led to
the seminal RNA World.
