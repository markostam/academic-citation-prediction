ABSTRACT
Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congeni-
tal disease linked to mutations in the ribosomal
protein genes rps19, rps24 and rps17. It belongs to
the emerging class of ribosomal disorders. To
understand the impact of DBA mutations on
RPS19 function, we have solved the crystal struc-
ture of RPS19 from Pyrococcus abyssi. The protein
forms a five a-helix bundle organized around a
central amphipathic a-helix, which corresponds to
the DBA mutation hot spot. From the structure, we
classify DBA mutations relative to their respective
impact on protein folding (class I) or on surface
properties (class II). Class II mutations cluster into
two conserved basic patches. In vivo analysis in
yeast demonstrates an essential role for class II
residues in the incorporation into pre-40S ribosomal
particles. This data indicate that missense muta-
tions in DBA primarily affect the capacity of the
protein to be incorporated into pre-ribosomes, thus
blocking maturation of the pre-40S particles.
INTRODUCTION
Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital
disorder characterized by the defective diﬀerentiation of
pro-erythroblasts, the precursors of red blood cells.
Patients suﬀer severe anemia and display heterogeneous
clinical features including malformations, growth failure
and predisposition to cancer (1,2). Linkage analysis has
revealed that a quarter of all DBA reported cases are
connected to the heterozygous mutation of the gene
encoding the ribosomal protein RPS19 (3,4). The RPS19
protein is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and
belongs to a family of ribosomal proteins restricted to
eukaryotes and archea. It is essential for yeast viability
and for early stages of development in mice (5,6).
Disruption as well as point mutations of the rps19 gene
in yeast and human cells aﬀect maturation of the pre-
ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) and block production of the
40S ribosomal subunits (5,7–9). Why the mutation of
a ribosomal protein primarily aﬀects pro-erythroblast
diﬀerentiation remains a central question. However,
recent linkage of a two other ribosomal protein genes,
rps24 and rps17, to DBA (10,11) strongly supports the
hypothesis that DBA is the consequence of a ribosomal
disorder (8,12).
Over 60 diﬀerent mutations aﬀecting the rps19 gene
have been reported, including deletions, insertions, frame-
shifts, premature stop codons and missense mutations
(13–15). Some mutations, like very early stop codons or
modiﬁcation of the promoter clearly result in RPS19
haplodeﬁciency by hampering synthesis of RPS19 from
the mutated allele. However, for more subtle mutations
like missense mutations, the question arises as to
whether they aﬀect the folding of the protein or whether
they are milder mutations aﬀecting the function while
preserving the overall fold. Since there is no homolog of
RPS19 in bacteria, for which high-resolution structures
of the small ribosomal subunit are available, the structure
of RPS19 and its precise location within the 40S subunit
remain unknown. The crystal structure of RPS19
from Pyroccocus abyssi presented herein ﬁlls this gap
and provides a rationale for the impact of RPS19
mutations in DBA.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Protein expression, purification and crystallization
Pyrococcus abyssi RPS19 cDNA was cloned into a
pET-15b (Novagen) modiﬁed plasmid. The expression
was carried out in BL21 (DE3) Rosetta cells (Novagen) at
158C. Bacterial cells were sonicated and centrifuged for
30min at 50 000 g. The supernatant was heated up for
20min at 508C and centrifuged for another 30min at
50 000 g. After incubation and elution from the cobalt-
aﬃnity resin, the tag was cleaved from the protein by an
overnight digest with 1/200 (w/w) ratio with TEV. A step
of puriﬁcation on Hi-S (Pharmacia) was carried out and
the protein was eluted at about 600mM NaCl. The
protein was concentrated to up to 10mg/ml in 50mM
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 600mM NaCl. Crystals were obtained
at 208C by the hanging drop vapor diﬀusion method by
mixing equal amounts of the protein solution and of a
reservoir composed of 30–36% PEG 2000 MME, 100mM
Tris–HCl pH 6.8–7.5 over a couple days to a size of
50 200 200 microns. They diﬀracted to 1.15 A˚ on
synchrotron beamline and belonged to the space group
P212121 with cell dimensions a¼ 32 A˚, b¼ 57 A˚, c¼ 82 A˚
and contained one molecule per asymmetric unit and 48%
solvent.
Structure solution and refinement
Native and derivative data were collected at the ESRF
synchrotron and processed with XDS (16). Data collection
statistics are shown in Table 1. A HgBr2 derivative
resulting from a 12-h soak in 2.5% (v/v) HgBr2 (prepared
from a saturated solution) was collected at the LIII-edge
of Hg. Derivative data set was combined with the most
isomorphous native data set, SHELXD and SHARP were
used to locate and reﬁne the heavy atom site position
(17,18). The resulting phases had an overall ﬁgure of merit
(FOM) of 0.33 at a resolution of 2.0 A˚. After solvent
ﬂattening with Solomon (SHARP), automatic building
was carried out with ARP/wARP (19). Out of a total of
150 residues, 125 were initially placed. Further building
and reﬁnement cycles were carried out with Coot and
REFMAC (20,21). Last cycles of reﬁnement were carried
out including hydrogens and using individual anisotropic
B factors.
The ﬁnal model has a good stereochemistry with an
R-free value of 15.5% and a R-factor value of 13.7%
(Table 1).
Analysis of RPS19 mutations in yeast
Site-directed mutagenesis on yeast RPS19 was performed
by PCR. For complementation experiments, the mutated
alleles were subcloned into vector pFL38-Ps15 (URA3),
downstream of the constitutive RPS15 promoter. The
resulting plasmids were introduced in the ura3
GAL-RPS19 strain (5). Cells were cultured in liquid
synthetic medium containing galactose, but no uracil, and
spotted at diﬀerent densities on agar plates using the same
medium, with either galactose or glucose as the carbon
source to modulate RPS19 expression.
To evaluate incorporation of wild-type or mutated
RPS19A into ribosomes, the corresponding open reading
frames were also cloned in frame downstream the TAP tag
coding sequence in the pFL38-Ps15 vector and expressed
in Euroscarf strain Y06271 (rps19A::KanMX, RPS19B).
Whole cell extracts were fractionated by ultracentrifuga-
tion on sucrose gradient for ribosome analysis. Two
hundred milliliters of yeast culture were grown in YPD
medium to an OD600 of 0.5 and cycloheximide was added
at a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mg/ml. After 10min
incubation, yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 5000 r.p.m and washed in 20ml ice-cold buﬀer
A [20mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10mM KCl, 5mM MgCl2,
1mM EGTA, 1mM DTT and 100 mg/ml cycloheximide].
Cells were broken with glass beads and re-suspended
in 150 ml buﬀer A. The suspension was clariﬁed by
centrifugation for 5min at 10 000 r.p.m. An amount of
the extract corresponding to 1mg of protein was loaded
on a 10.5ml 10–50% sucrose gradient in buﬀer A without
cycloheximide and centrifuged for 12 h at 26 000 r.p.m in a
SW41 rotor. A gradient collector (A¨KTAprime—
Amersham Biosciences), in combination with a
Pharmacia UV-detector LKB.UV-M II, was used to
record the UV proﬁle. Twenty 0.5ml fractions were
collected and 150 ml of each fraction were slot-blotted
on nitrocellulose membrane to detect TAP-tagged
RPS19A. The membrane was then incubated with

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure of RPS19
The structure of RPS19 from P. abyssi (RPS19Pa) was
determined by SIRAS on a mercury derivative and reﬁned
against the best native data set. The ﬁnal model has an
R-free value of 15.5% (Table 1) and comprises residues
2 to 150 with the exception of two disordered loops
between residues 37–44 and 79–84 (Figure 1a). The
structure of RPS19 is almost entirely a-helical and folds
around a ﬁve a-helix bundle. Knowing that human RPS19
(RPS19Hs) shares 36% identity and 57% similarity with
P. abyssi RPS19 (RPS19Pa) sequence (Figure 1c), we may
assume that they display a similar fold. In the rest of
the text, RPS19 residues in P. abyssi, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Homo sapiens are labeled ‘Pa’, ‘Sc’ and ‘Hs’
respectively (Table 2).
Two distinct classes of mutations in DBA patients cluster
around an amphipathic helix
Fourteen amino acids of RPS19 are the targets of missense
mutations in DBA patients. Although these mutations
are spread along the entire primary sequence (Figure 1c),
the structure of RPS19Pa shows that most missense
mutations cluster within or around the a-helix 3
(Figure 1a). This a-helix, made of residues 50–65 of
RPS19Pa (52–67 in human numbering), corresponds to the
mutation hot spot. It is located at a central position in the

structure where it bridges a-helices 1 and 6 on one side
with a-helices 4 and 5 on the other side (Figure 1a).
The apolar side of a-helix 3 is engaged into hydrophobic
interactions with residues of the neighboring a-helices,
thus forming the hydrophobic core of the protein
(Figure 1b). Strikingly, three mutations on a-helix 3
(A57PHs, A61S/EHs, L64PHs), two on a-helix 1 (V15FHs
and L18PHs) and two on a-helix 6 (G127EHs and
L131RHs) aﬀect residues involved in this hydrophobic
core (green residues on Figure 1). Thus, although distant
on the primary sequence, these seven amino acids are
functionally related and are involved in the folding and
the stability of the protein.
In contrast, mutations P47LHs, W52RHs, R56QHs,
S59FHs, R62W/QHs, R101HHs and G120SHs aﬀect resi-
dues located on the surface of RPS19 (red residues on
Figure 1). Remarkably, these residues show a much higher
degree of inter-species conservation than the amino acids
within the hydrophobic core (Figure 1c). These residues
are located within two highly conserved basic patches
at the surface of the protein (Figure 2). On the polar face
of a-helix 3, four exposed mutated residues (W52Hs,
R56Hs, S59Hs and R62Hs) form the ﬂoor of a central basic
groove (patch A on Figure 2a–c). In addition, residues
from a-helices 4 and 5 and from the b-sheet deﬁne
the conserved patch B (Figure 2d–f). It comprises
residues R99Pa (R101Hs), K100Pa (R102Hs), Q103Pa
(Q105Hs), K113Pa (K115Hs), G118Pa (G120Hs) and
R119Pa (R121Hs). DBA mutations R101HHs and
G120SHs aﬀect this conserved surface. Interestingly, both
conserved surfaces have a positive electrostatic charge:
patch A harbors a localized positive charge (Figure 2c),
whereas patch B is embedded in a larger positive area
(Figure 2f).
Based on these observations, we propose to subdivide
DBA mutations into two classes: class I encompasses

structural residues aﬀecting the folding of the protein;
class II mutations aﬀect surface residues and would impair
the function of RPS19 without altering its overall fold.
It should be noted that the Val13Pa (V15FHs) and W50Pa
(W52RHs) are partially involved in Van der Waals
contacts with neighboring atoms and are also partially
exposed to the solvent. Class I mutations aﬀecting protein
folding are predicted to render the protein unstable.
Indeed, when expressed in COS cells, mutant RPS19
V15FHs and G127EHs were shown to be present at low
level, in contrast to class II mutants R56QHs, R62WHs
whose level was similar to that of wild-type RPS19 (24,25).
Along this line, a recent report conﬁrms and extends
these results by showing that class I mutants V15FHs,
L18PHs, A57PHs, A61S/EHs, G127EHs and L131PHs are
rapidly degraded by the proteasome when expressed in
mammalian cells, whereas class II mutants P47LHs,
W52RHs, R56QHs, R62WHs, R62QHs, R101HHs, are
G120SHs are more stable (26). Thus, the classiﬁcation
proposed here perfectly correlates with the instability
observed for class I mutants expressed in cultured cells.
The conserved basic patches are critical for RPS19 function
In order to test whether the conserved surface areas are
essential for the function RPS19, we performed functional
complementation in yeast. RPS19 is encoded by two
genes, RPS19A and RPS19B, in S. cerevisiae. DBA-like
mutations, as well as systematic R to E mutations that
alter the charge of these basic conserved areas, were
introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the RPS19A
gene. The ability of these mutant alleles to support growth
was evaluated in a rps19A rps19B mutant strain
conditionally expressing the wild-type RPS19A under
control of a galactose promoter. As shown in Figure 3,
DBA mutations R57QSc, R63QSc and R102HSc had
a drastic eﬀect on RPS19 capacity to support cell
growth in glucose, whereas mutation R63WSc partially
supported growth. Similarly, mutation to glutamic acid of
R57Sc, S60Sc and R63Sc in patch A and R102Sc, R122Sc in
patch B, completely abolished cell growth. In contrast, the
double mutation R130E-R134E, outside of the conserved
patches, had little impact on viability. These results show
the crucial role of basic patches A and B in RPS19
function.
As already observed with this assay (23), among class I
mutations, I65PSc (L64PHs) was not viable, I15FSc
(V15FHs) strongly aﬀected RPS19 function, whereas
substitution A62SSc (A61SHs) had little impact on cell
growth, which was also the case for class II mutation
G121SSc (G120SHs). Although aﬀecting highly conserved
residues, these two latter mutations may have more critical
eﬀects in human than in yeast.
Requirement of patches A and B for RPS19 incorporation
into pre-ribosomes
In order to further characterize the loss-of-function
associated with mutation of surface residues, we tested
whether class II mutations aﬀected RPS19 incorporation
into pre-ribosomes. We thus analysed association of
RPS19 mutants with pre-ribosomal RNAs in yeast. TAP
tagged wild-type and mutant alleles of RPS19A were
expressed in place of the endogenous RPS19A gene in a
rps19A/RPS19Bþ strain. Production of RPS19 in this
strain is insuﬃcient and pre-rRNA processing is partially
defective (5), which mimics RPS19 haploinsuﬃciency in
DBA patients. Using the complementation assay
described in Figure 3, we checked that the RPS19-TAP
protein remained functional (data not shown).

Figure 3. Eﬀect of mutations on RPS19 function in yeast. Capacity of various RPS19 mutants to complement RPS19 expression knockdown was
tested in a yeast strain expressing wild-type RPS19 under control of a GAL promoter. Expression of wild-type RPS19 gene is shutdown upon
transfer to glucose containing medium whereas transcription of the mutant forms is driven by a constitutive promoter. Cells were spotted at three
diﬀerent densities.

When captured on IgG Sepharose, the wild-type
RPS19-TAP and the G121SSc mutant co-precipitated
with the 18S and 25S rRNAs (Figure 4b, lower panel),
indicating incorporation into mature ribosomes
(not dissociated under our experimental conditions).
Detection of the precursors of the 18S rRNA, by
northern blot analysis with the D-A2 probe, showed
co-precipitation of the 20S pre-rRNA (Figure 4a, upper
panel), the direct precursor to the 18S rRNA (Figure 4b).
This indicates the presence of these proteins in pre-40S
particles. The 32S and 35S pre-rRNAs, which are part of
the early 90S pre-ribosomes, were undetectable or close to

(top panel) or rps19 deﬁcient cells (lower panel). Letters above pre-rRNAs indicate cleavage sites. (b, c) TAP-tagged wild-type or mutated RPS19A
expressed in rps19A/RPS19B yeast cells were isolated with IgG Sepharose beads. Pre-rRNAs in the whole cell extract (‘Input’) and the isolated
material (‘I.P.’) were analyzed by northern blot with probes complementary to segment D-A2 (panel B) or to segment A2-A3 (panel C). The mature
18S and 25S rRNAs were detected by ethidium bromide staining. The three panels correspond to independent experiments. In panels A and C,
expression of the sole TAP tag was used as a negative control (TAP). The precipitation background level was also evaluated by detecting the 27S-B
pre-rRNA with a probe complementary to the ITS2 (data not shown):50.1% was co-precipitated in panel A and C,50.3% in panel B, as measured
by phosphorimaging. The portion of co-precipitated 20S, 18S and 25S RNAs did not signiﬁcantly exceed the background value in all panels, except
for the wild-type and G121S forms (1–3% of co-precipitation). (d) Levels of TAP-tagged proteins in inputs (corresponding to panel A) were analyzed
by western blot with peroxidase anti-peroxidase antibody complexes, which bind to protein A.

background in the precipitated fractions, depending on
the experiments.
Mutations in basic patch A (R57ESc, R57QSc, R63ESc)
or basic patch B (R102ESc, R122ESc) reduced the
amount of co-precipitated mature 18S and 25S rRNAs
to background level (Figure 4b and c, lower panel).
A similar result was obtained with class I mutation I15FSc.
In addition, these proteins did not co-purify with 20S
pre-rRNA (Figure 4b). This result was not correlated with
diﬀerences in protein expression levels of the various
mutants (Figure 4d). Cleavage of the 32S pre-rRNA in the
early 90S pre-ribosomal particles normally yields the 20S
and 27S-A2 pre-rRNAs, included in the pre-40S and pre-
60S particles, respectively (Figure 4a, left panel).
Deﬁciency in RPS19 was shown to block cleavage at site
A2 (5); alternative cleavage at site A3 produces the 21S
and 27S-A3 pre-rRNAs, as illustrated in ﬁgure 4a
(right panel). We thus considered the hypothesis
that RPS19 mutants were incorporated into ill-matured
pre-40S particles containing 21S pre-rRNA instead of 20S.
As expected, a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of 21S
pre-rRNA, paralleled by a drop in the 27S-A2 pre-rRNA
level, was detected in cells expressing RPS19-TAP with
mutations R57ESc, R63ESc, R102ESc or R122ESc

Figure 5. Analysis of wild-type and mutant RPS19 association to ribosomes on sucrose gradient.Ribosomes from rps19A/RPS19B yeast strains
expressing wild-type or mutated forms of RPS19A fused to the TAP tag were separated on sucrose gradient as described in material and methods.
RPS19-TAP was detected in gradient fractions on slot blots with peroxidase. Panels a, b and c correspond to three series of experiments. Experiments
were performed two or three times with similar results. Expression of the sole TAP tag was used as a negative control (TAP).

(Figure 4c, ‘input’). However, the 21S pre-rRNA did not
co-precipitate with mutated RPS19-TAP (Figure 4c,
‘I. P.’). Thus, mutation of the basic patches A and B
prevents incorporation of RPS19 into pre-ribosomal
particles.
These data were fully consistent with the analysis of
RPS19 association with ribosomes on sucrose gradients.
As shown in Figure 5a, the wild-type TAP-RPS19 protein
was mostly present in the fractions containing the
40S subunits, the 80S ribosomes and the polysomes,
indicating very eﬃcient incorporation into mature
subunits. In contrast, mutations in conserved patches A
and B resulted in a large amount of free protein at the top
of the gradient, with no preferential association
with mature ribosomes (Figure 5a,b). Noticeably, part of
these mutated forms of RPS19 was present in high-density
fractions. The A62SSc and G121SSc mutants, as well as
double mutant R130ESc/R134ESc (outside of the con-
served basic patches), which all support growth in RPS19
depleted yeast, showed an association proﬁle very close to
that of wild-type RPS19 (Figure 5c). The I15FSc mutation,
which does not totally abrogate RPS19 function in yeast,
showed partial association with mature ribosomes
(Figure 5c).
These results indicate that the solvent accessible
residues in the mutation hot spot (patch A) or in basic
patch B play a critical role in the incorporation of RPS19
into pre-ribosomes. This may involve direct
interaction with pre-ribosomal RNA, as supported by
the positive charge of these domains, and/or with
ribosomal proteins.
In conclusion, we propose that DBA missense muta-
tions primarily result in RPS19 haplodeﬁciency, by
impacting either its folding and its stability, or its capacity
to engage intermolecular interactions. The DBA mutation
hot spot appears as a key structural element of RPS19
involved both in the constitution of the hydrophobic core
and in a highly conserved surface. Impairment of
ribosome biogenesis resulting from RPS19 haplodeﬁciency
may have two direct consequences. First, a low rate of
small ribosomal subunit production may limit the cell
translation capacity (25). Second, alteration of ribosome
biogenesis, and subsequently of the nucleolus organization
(7), may be perceived by the cell as a ‘nucleolar stress’
and favor cell cycle arrest (27–29) These phenomena,
alone or in combination, could prevent diﬀerentiation of
pro-erythroblasts (7,12,30). In addition, our data do not
exclude a dominant negative eﬀect of the missense
mutants, upstream or aside of association with pre-
ribosomes, especially in the case of the more stable class
II mutants. Presence of some mutants in high-density
fractions of the sucrose gradient suggests that they may be
engaged in multi-molecular complexes, diﬀerent from
ribosomes, and whose composition remains to be deter-
mined. Establishing genotype/phenotype relationships has
proved diﬃcult in DBA and this remains true when
considering the relative clinical impacts of class I and class
II mutations. Availability of RPS19 crystal structure
should be decisive to design new strategies to understand
RPS19 function and its role in erythropoiesis.
