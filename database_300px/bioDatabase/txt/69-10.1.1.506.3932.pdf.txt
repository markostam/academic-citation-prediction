ABSTRACT
Certain G-rich DNA sequences readily form four-
stranded structures called G-quadruplexes. These
sequence motifs are located in telomeres as a
repeated unit, and elsewhere in the genome, where
their function is currently unknown. It has been pro-
posed that G-quadruplexes may be directly involved
in gene regulation at the level of transcription. In
support of this hypothesis, we show that the pro-
moter regions (1 kb upstream of the transcription
start site TSS) of genes are significantly enriched in
quadruplex motifs relative to the rest of the genome,
with >40% of human gene promoters containing one
or more quadruplex motif. Furthermore, these pro-
moter quadruplexes strongly associate with nucle-
ase hypersensitive sites identified throughout the
genome via biochemical measurement. Regions of
the human genome that are both nuclease hyper-
sensitive and within promoters show a remarkable
(230-fold) enrichment of quadruplex elements, com-
pared to the rest of the genome. These quadruplex
motifs identified in promoter regions also show an
interesting structural bias towards more stable
forms. These observations support the proposal
that promoter G-quadruplexes are directly involved
in the regulation of gene expression.
INTRODUCTION
The nucleobase guanine (G) is capable of self-assembling
to form hydrogen bonded motifs called G-tetrads [Figure 1a,
(1–4)]. G-rich nucleic acid sequences that contain stretches
of tandem Gs can form four stranded structures called
G-quadruplexes that comprise stacked G-tetrads (Figure 1b).
While the formation of G-quadruplexes in vitro has been
known for several decades, (1) there has been considerable
recent interest in the potential formation and function of such
non-classical nucleic acid structures in biology. It is known
that telomeres in many species can form G-quadruplexes
(5–7) and it was recently found that telomeric quadruplex
formation in vivo is regulated by telomere binding proteins,
under the control of a cell-cycle dependent phosphorylation
event (8). However, the role of quadruplexes outside telomeric
regions is still unclear, although the quadruplex motif is preva-
lent in the human genome, (9,10) with an average incidence of
1 quadruplex every 10 000 bases.
Dynamic behaviour of the quadruplex motif in duplex
DNA could be directly involved in gene regulation at the
level of transcription (Figure 1c). This dynamic behaviour
of G-quadruplex DNA has been studied in vitro for a single-
stranded system (11,12). The possibility that this dynamism
regulates gene activity was supported by the discovery of a
G-quadruplex in the promoter of the chicken b-globin gene,
(13,14) and the proposal has been directly investigated for
the case of the c-myc protooncogene (15–17). Recently, a
small number of quadruplexes have been located in promoter
regions of other genes (13,15,16,18–23).
In the absence of general evidence for this hypothesis, our
goal has been to analyse the relationship between promoters
and G-quadruplex elements throughout the human genome.
Using computational methods, we mapped out quadruplex
motifs in gene promoters that may be involved in transcrip-
tion regulation. Quadruplexes were found to be highly preva-
lent in human gene promoters. The analysis revealed
evidence of evolutionary selection pressure to concentrate
quadruplex elements in gene promoters and proximal to the
transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. Promoter quadru-
plexes were also found to be strongly associated with the
open form of chromatinised DNA as judged by experimental
genome-wide nuclease hypersensitivity data. Quadruplex
loops are critical to the stability and folded structure, and
promoter quadruplexes show an enrichment of stabilizing
loops that promote a defined fold. We propose that quadru-
plex elements may be cis-acting regulatory elements for a
large proportion (40%) of the genes in the human genome.

ENSEMBL database marked as ‘known’, using NCBI
build 34. PQS positions were generated using the program
quadparser (9), which searches for sequences of the form
G3+N17G3+N17G3+N17G3+ (or the corresponding C-rich
pattern). Loop-lengths were provided from quadparser.
Where loop lengths could not be attributed to a PQS because
it had an extremely long run of G, it was discarded for loop
study purposes. Where PQS had more than three loops
(because of having more than 4 runs of GGG), the 30 end
set of loops was used to avoid over-counting. All coordinates
used NCBI build 34 of the human genome. NHS data were
taken from the published work of Crawford et al. (24,25)
and were generated from quiescent human CD4+ T cells.
A total of 161 715 data points were provided, and 5158
clusters derived, each containing at least three data points
within 500 bp. Sites where multiple nuclease cleavage points
were identified in such close proximity were argued by
Crawford et al. to have high reliability, and where such a
cluster contained three or more cleavage points, they were
over 80% likely to be valid.
Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen (Paisley,
UK). They were synthesized on a 50 nmol scale and
supplied lyophilized. Stock solutions (50 mM) of the
oligonucleotides were made with Milli-Q water. The
sequences of the oligonucleotides used in these studies are
shown in Table 2.
UV melting
UV melting curves were collected using a Varian Cary 1E
UV-vis spectrophotometer, measuring the spectral absorbance
at 295 nm, which has been previously identified as a key
absorbance region for quadruplex formation (26). Samples
were prepared at 4 mM in a buffer containing 100 mM KCl
and 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4). These samples were then
heat-annealed to 90C and allowed to slowly cool to 4C
over a period of several hours. In a typical experiment
150 ml of a sample was degassed in a Speedvac for 3 min,
transferred to a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette, and then cov-
ered with a layer of mineral oil (Sigma–Aldrich). It was then
transferred to the spectrometer and equilibrated at 5C for 10
min. It was then heated to 90C and cooled to 5C at 0.2C/
min, with data collection occurring every 0.5C on both the
annealing and melting steps. Tm values for the sequences
were determined from alpha plots of the melting profiles
following the method of Mergny (26). This analysis assumes
simple two-state equilibrium between the folded and
unfolded forms, with linear variations of absorbance with
temperature for both species.

CD
CD experiments were performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropo-
larimeter using inbuilt software. Samples were prepared at
4 mM in a buffer containing 100 mM KCl and 10 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.4). These samples were then heat-annealed
to 90C and allowed to slowly cool to 4C over a period
of several hours. In a typical experiment 400 ml of a sample
was transferred to a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette, and
scans were performed over the range 220–320 nm. Each trace
is the result of the average of five scans at 50 nm/min, with a
2 s response time, 1 nm pitch and 1 nm bandwidth. The sam-
ples were left to equilibrate at 4C for 10 min before the scans
were performed. A constant flow of dry nitrogen ensured
there was no condensation. A blank sample containing only
buffer was treated in the same manner and subtracted from
the collected data. For graphing purposes, the data were
smoothed slightly, with each data point being graphed as
the average of those around it and a zero correction being
applied at 320 nm.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We have previously mapped out putative quadruplex
sequences (PQS) in the human genome by a computational
methodology, which identifies motifs of the form G3+N17
G3+N17G3+N17G3+ that we have shown are predisposed
to the formation of intramolecular quadruplexes (9). As we
show later in this paper, such in silico predicted motifs do
form stable G-quadruplexes. To investigate the relationship
between quadruplex formation and transcriptional regulation,
we have generally defined putative promoter regions as being
1 kb upstream of the 50 end of the TSS for a given gene,
unless otherwise stated. Our study was carried out on the
19 268 known human genes in ENSEMBL (NCBI 34), so
this definition covers 19.3 Mb of the genome. Within all
these gene promoters, we identified 14 769 PQS, at an aver-
age density of 0.77 PQS/kb. Thus PQS are enriched by a
factor of 6.4 in gene promoters as compared to the average
throughout the whole genome (0.13 PQS/kbase) (Table 1).
This is indicative of an evolutionary selection pressure for
quadruplexes to occur within gene promoters.
A second observation arising from this analysis is that
42.7% of the gene promoters contained at least 1 PQS. Within
the promoters the probability of finding a PQS is directly
related to its proximity with the TSS (Figure 2a). The highest
concentration of PQS occurs very near the TSS, with the PQS
density in the first 100 upstream bases being over 12 times
higher that the genome average. There is a progressive reduc-
tion in PQS density away from the TSS until it decreases to
below the genome average at distances remote from the TSS
(>20 000 bases). Figure 2b shows the proportion of gene pro-
moters that contain at least one quadruplex as the size of the
promoter is varied, by increasing the distance from the TSS.
The most rapid increase in the distribution occurs at much
smaller promoter sizes, and for 29% of promoters at least
one PQS exists within the first 300 bases upstream from the
TSS. That PQS density is highest proximal to the TSS is con-
sistent with quadruplex elements functioning as a topological
switch mechanistically connected with transcription.
We have also investigated which types of genes have
such promoter PQS sequences. Investigating the promoters
of 95 proto-oncogenes (27) showed that the have a signifi-
cantly elevated frequency of having PQS, with 66 (69%)
having at least one promoter PQS. We also examined the
Gene Ontology (GO) codes of all promoters, to investigate,
which categories showed significantly greater or lower
frequencies of PQS promoters. GO categories which were
significantly more likely to contain promoter PQS included
those for transcription factor activity, development, neuroge-
nesis and kinase activity. GO categories significantly less
likely to have promoter PQS include olfaction, G-protein
signalling, immune response, nucleic acid binding and
protein biosynthesis. A full list of genes with significant
deviations from chance (P < 1.25 · 104) is included in
Supplementary Data.
We also considered the accessibility of DNA in these
locations, and so looked at nuclease hypersensitivity data.
Measurement of nuclease hypersensitivity is an experimental
approach to identify regions within genomic DNA that have
undergone a structural transition from the double helix to an
unwound form that exposes single stranded DNA (28). Such a
transition is required in gene promoters during transcription
activation. Crawford et al. (24,25) (http://research.nhgri.nih.
gov/DNaseHS/May2005/) have generated a genome wide
map of DNase I hypersensitive sites (NHS) within nuclear
chromatin, generated from quiescent human CD4+ T cells.
We analysed this dataset to evaluate associations with
quadruplex motifs, and also with promoter quadruplexes. Fol-
lowing Crawford et al. (24) we considered regions of the gen-
ome characterized by having three or more nuclease cleavage
points, each separated by no more than 500 bp, which gener-
ated a dataset of 5158 NHS clusters. We computationally
analysed the incidence of PQS within 500 bp of NHS clusters.
Two-thirds (66.0%) of these NHS clusters were found to have
at least one PQS, on either the plus or minus strand, within
this range resulting in 8038 NHS-PQS motifs (a number of
NHS clusters has more than one PQS). The mean density
of PQS in NHS clusters was 1.07 PQS/kb, which is 8.6
times higher than the genome average (0.13 PQS/kb)
(Table 1). Tightening the definition used for NHSs by reduc-
ing the separation between experimentally determined cleav-
age points tended to increase the density of PQS found. For
example, using a 200 bp range for the NHE cluster gives
3204 clusters with 4271 PQS within 500 bp, an average den-
sity of 4.5 PQS/kbase. The same effect was observed when
the maximum separation of PQS from NHS was reduced.
Consideration of only the areas within an NHS cluster
gives 3135 PQS at a mean density of 1.35 PQS/kb, greater
than 10 times the genome average. Thus there is a strong

association between nuclease hypersensitivity and the
incidence of quadruplexes genome-wide.
By considering PQS that occur both within NHS clusters
and 1 kb promoters, an even more pronounced PQS density
might be expected if there is a functional role for
G-quadruplexes in regulating transcription (Figure 1). A total
of 94.5 kb of genomic DNA were found to be both within
500 bp of a NHS and within a 1 kb promoter. There were
2702 PQS elements within the promoter-NHS cluster regions
giving a mean density of 28.6 PQS/kb. Thus, the density of
PQS elements is 230 times higher within promoter-NHS clus-
ter regions as compared to the average PQS incidence
throughout the genome. This is a very high enrichment,
greater than two orders of magnitude and also much greater
than the product of the independent enrichments. This density
of PQS (1 every 35 bases) is very high considering that a PQS
must be at least 15 bases long. (see Table 1).
We have considered that NHS regions are rich in the
normally rare CpG dinucleotide (29,30). We have shown
that our observation of PQS enrichment was not simply
caused by CpG enrichment. Theoretically, the presence of
PQS is determined by the frequency of the ‘strong’ homodi-
ads GpG and CpC (for the other strand), (9) and enrichment
in competing homodiads would tend, if anything, to reduce
the frequency of PQS formation. This was confirmed by
analysis of the genomic data (see Supplementary Data).
The length of the intervening loops between G tracts
directly control the folded geometry and thermodynamic
stability of quadruplexes. In particular, biophysical experi-
ments (31,32) suggest that the presence of single-nucleotide
loops is likely to increase the thermal stability of the folded
quadruplex structure, a feature likely to be linked to biologi-
cal function. Furthermore, a single nucleotide quadruplex
loop must adopt a well defined geometry, called a double
chain reversal that pre-disposes the quadruplex to adopt a
parallel fold. (31) A number of structurally characterized
promoter quadruplexes that occur within gene promoters
have been found to contain one or more single-base loop
(15,16,19–23). In the genome as a whole, 64% of PQS
have at least one single nucleotide loop. However, in promot-
ers the occurrence of single nucleotide loops in PQS is
substantially higher. Of the 3087 PQS in the first 100 bases
upstream of the TSS, 78% of them have at least one single-
base loop (Figure 3a). This proportion gradually declines
towards the genome average (64%) on moving away from
the TSS. This suggests that proximal to the TSS, evolutionary
selective pressure has favoured PQS with stabilizing loop
lengths and a predisposition towards a parallel folded
structure. Folding topology is important in the recognition
of quadruplexes, as has been demonstrated for both protein
(33) and small molecule (34) quadruplex ligands, because
different surfaces are presented for recognition.
A comparable analysis of single base loops for NHS cluster,
and also for promoter regions that coincided with NHS
clusters, revealed a higher incidence of single-base loops in
these PQS (see Figure 3b and c). For the PQS that were

percentage of promoter regions containing at least one PQS increases as the size of the promoter increases. This increase is extremely fast over the first
1000 bases. The dashed line shows what percentage would be predicted if the density of PQS were equal to that across the genome as a whole.

both near NHS clusters and also within promoter regions,
high-proportions were observed to have single-nucleotide
loops. Using our standard definitions of NHS clusters (within
500 bp) and promoters (1000 bp upstream of the TSS), 71%
of these PQS have single-nucleotide loops. If these definitions
are tightened, by reducing the ranges in each case, then the
proportions of single-base loops go up, so for example if
NHS clusters are defined as being within 200 bp, and promot-
ers only the first 300 bp, then 81% of the PQS identified have
single-nucleotide loops. This suggests that selection pressures
have favoured these highly-filtered PQS to be stable, and
hence more likely to be folded into a quadruplex under
physiological conditions.
In our analysis we have assumed that all PQS can form
G-quadruplexes. To test this assumption, 10 sample PQS
sequences were synthesized and studied using ultraviolet
(UV) melting (26) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy,
(6,35,36), which are biophysical techniques widely employed
for the validation of quadruplex folded structures. Two sets of
PQS were characterized. One set (Table 2) consisted of five
sequences with a large number of nearby NHE cleavage
positions (>12 within 500 bp), and the other set (Table 3)

comprised five sequences in the promoter region of known
genes (defined as 1000 bp upstream of the TSS), with three
or more NHE cleavage positions within 50 bp (a tight defini-
tion given the limited range), and with some evidence of
conservation in Mus musculus. The sequences were selected
to include three bases at the 50 and 30 ends to eliminate arte-
facts resulting from having these ends proximal to the
quadruplex itself. The sequences vary considerably in their
base patterns, including the length of the putative loops, the
number of GGG repeats and other parameters. The oligonu-
cleotides were annealed under pseudo-physiological
conditions [100 mM KCl and 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4)],
heated to 90C and allowed to slow cool.
There are two classical CD traces described in literature for
quadruplex structures, (35,36) corresponding to two distinct
folding patterns-parallel (with all guanines anti), which has
a peak at 260 nm and a trough at 240 nm, and anti-parallel
(with guanines alternating syn and anti), which has a peak
at 295 nm and a trough at 260 nm. As shown in Figure 4,
all the sequences studied showed a peak at 260 nm (parallel),
and many also showed some amount of peak at 295 nm,
suggesting partial formation of anti-parallel structures. This
polymorphism is frequent for intramolecular quadruplex
structures, and has been observed before. UV-melting studies
(26) can reveal the characteristic hypochromic transition at
295 nm that quadruplexes exhibit upon melting, and were
also performed for these sequences (Tables 2 and 3).
Nine of the ten PQS studies yielded both CD and UV data,
which gave unambiguous support for quadruplex formation,
supporting the algorithm used to predict these sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
We have addressed the quadruplex-promoter hypothesis on a
human genome-wide scale revealing a number of striking
observations. Quadruplexes are enriched in promoters with
their probability density reaching a peak proximal to the
TSS. Promoter quadruplexes are prevalent in the human
genome, with >40% of the annotated genes containing one
or more promoter quadruplexes. Quadruplexes are also
enriched at nuclease hypersensitive sites, and quadruplexes
at both nuclease hypersensitive regions and promoters are
enriched by a factor of 230, compared to the rest of the gen-
ome. These multiple associations support the hypothesis that
quadruplexes play an important role in gene regulation
throughout the genome. This also opens up opportunities
for novel chemical intervention strategies, especially given
recent developments in small molecules that target the
G-quadruplex structural motif.
