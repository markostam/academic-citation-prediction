ABSTRACT
Besides linear RNAs, pre-mRNA splicing generates
three forms of RNAs: lariat introns, Y-structure
introns from trans-splicing, and circular exons
through exon skipping. To study the persistence
of excised introns in total cellular RNA, we used
three Escherichia coli 30 to 50 exoribonucleases. Ribo-
nuclease R (RNase R) thoroughly degrades the
abundant linear RNAs and the Y-structure RNA,
while preserving the loop portion of a lariat RNA.
Ribonuclease II (RNase II) and polynucleotide phos-
phorylase (PNPase) also preserve the lariat loop, but
are less efficient in degrading linear RNAs. RNase R
digestionof the total RNAfromhumanskeletal muscle
generates an RNA pool consisting of lariat and circu-
lar RNAs. RT–PCR across the branch sites confirmed
lariat RNAsandcircularRNAs in thepool generatedby
constitutive and alternative splicing of the dystro-
phin pre-mRNA. Our results indicate that RNase R
treatment can be used to construct an intronic cDNA
library, in which majority of the intron lariats are
represented. The highly specific activity of RNase R
implies its ability to screen for rare intragenic trans-
splicing in any target gene with a large background
of cis-splicing. Further analysis of the intronic RNA
pool from a specific tissue or cell will provide insights
into the global profile of alternative splicing.
INTRODUCTION
Completion of the human genome sequencing project will
be followed by detailed genome annotation (1–3). Most of
available physical resources for cDNA clones were only
partially sequenced as expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
Full-length cDNAs, copied from complete mRNAs, are an
important resource for identifying genes and determining
their structural features, forming a basis for transcriptome
analysis [reviewed in (4,5)]. In theory, excised intronic
cDNA sequences generated by pre-mRNA splicing can
constitute a complementary resource. As an initial approach
to investigating the availability of the intronic cDNA, we
examined how well the excised lariat RNAs are preserved
in the total cellular RNA. We tested representative
Escherichia coli exoribonucleases for their ability to remove
abundant linear RNAs and to enrich lariat introns in RNA
sources. A special RT–PCR protocol was subsequently used
to detect and identify specific lariat introns of the target human
gene transcripts.
Besides linear and lariat RNAs, pre-mRNA splicing process
has the capability to produce two topologically distinct RNA
species, i.e. a Y-structure branch RNA and a true circular
RNA. Trans-splicing releases introns with branches, instead
of lariat introns in the case of conventional cis-splicing
[reviewed in (6,7)]. Two kinds of pre-mRNA trans-splicing
take place naturally in eukaryotes; (i) Intergenic trans-
splicing, in which a short spliced-leader (SL) sequence is
transferred to pre-mRNA 30 splice sites, and becomes a 50-
end sequence which is shared by multiple mRNAs. This SL
trans-splicing takes place most commonly in trypanosomes
and nematodes; (ii) Intragenic (or homotypic) trans-splicing,
in which the 50 splice site on one pre-mRNA is joined to the
30 splice site on another pre-mRNA transcribed from the
same gene. This type of trans-splicing has been reported in
Drosophila and mammals [(8,9) and references therein].
Circular RNAs, without any branching of the 20, 50-phosphodi-
ester bond, have been identified in several transcripts of mam-
malian genes (10–18). It has been suggested that circular RNA

consisting of spliced exons is generated by re-splicing of
excised lariat RNA in the process of exon skipping type alter-
native splicing (14). Removing of an intron, including the
branch portion, in this process produces a complete circular
RNA molecule with a 30, 50-phosphodiester bond. Therefore,
circular RNA that consists of multiple exons could be a
by-product, and thus evidence, of the exon skipping type
alternative splicing.
A 30 to 50 exoribonuclease digests linear RNAs from their
free 30 termini, but it should also digest Y-structure branch
RNA that has two 30 termini, while the loop portions of lariat
RNA and circular RNA that lack their 30 ends must be refract-
ory to exoribonucleases. Thus, 30 to 50 exoribonucleases can be
used to discriminate lariat RNA and branch RNA, which are
distinct intron products of cis-splicing and trans-splicing,
respectively. We wish to examine which kinds of E.coli
exoribonucleases can strictly distinguish these RNA structures
as substrates.
Seven different 30 to 50 RNases have been characterized
in E.coli so far; Ribonuclease II (RNase II), ribonuclease R
(RNase R), polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and
oligoribonuclease have been reported to function in mRNA
degradation [reviewed in (19)]. The substrate specificities
of these exoribonucleases are different. Oligoribonuclease is
required for the complete degradation of small oligoribonu-
cleotides (20). RNase II prefers homopolymers such as
poly(A), whereas RNase R is more active on rRNAs (21).
The degradation activities of PNPase and RNase II are affected
by RNA secondary structures while RNase R is more effective
on the structured RNA, e.g. the repetitive extragenic palin-
dromic (REP) sequence (21,22).
In this study, we analyzed the digestion activity of three
highly purified exoribonucleases, RNase R, RNase II and
PNPase, with model RNA substrates prepared from in vitro
splicing of human b-globin pre-mRNA, which is a well-
characterized splicing substrate (23,24). We found that
RNase R is an ideal ribonuclease to destroy abundant linear
RNAs while the loop portions of lariat RNAs remain fully
intact. Using human total RNA, we demonstrate that RNase R
digestion successfully yields an RNA source that consists of
lariat RNAs and circular RNAs derived from pre-mRNA
splicing. An mRNA source for conventional cDNA is usually
separated using oligo(dT) chromatography by the poly(A) tail
on its 30 end, whereas our method screens for lariat RNAs by
the unique 20-50 linked loop structure. Our results indicate that
this new technology can be used to construct an intronic cDNA
library, which should complement the information contained
in conventional (exonic) cDNA libraries generated from
mature mRNAs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of E.coli RNases
E.coli RNase II, RNase R and PNPase genes were all cloned
into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen). The enzymes
were overexpressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) or Rosetta(DE3)-
pLysS strains (Novagen) after induction with isopropyl-b-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The RNase R used in this work
is a truncated form with deletion of the C-terminal 83 amino
acids (Arg/Lys-rich region). This truncated RNase R shows no
difference in activity when compared with full-length RNase
R. The details of cloning, overexpression and purification of
these exoribonucleases will be published elsewhere (Y. Zuo,
Y. Wang and A. Malhotra, manuscript in preparation). In
brief, RNase II and C-terminal truncated RNase R were
chromatographically purified using the same series of four
columns; Affi-gel Blue (Amersham Biosciences), Hydroxy-
apatite (BioRad), Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) and
Superdex S200 (Amersham Biosciences). PNPase was puri-
fied using an initial ammonium sulfate precipitation step,
followed by Hydroxapatite, Mono Q and Superdex S200
column chromatography. The purified enzymes are fully active
and are at least 95% pure as judged by SDS–PAGE (Coomassie
blue staining).
In vitro splicing
In vitro splicing assays with HeLa cell nuclear extracts were
performed as described previously (24,25). Splicing reactions
with human b-globin pre-mRNA were incubated at 30C for
1 h. The splicing products were extracted with phenol and
ethanol precipitated (without tRNA as a carrier) to be used
as RNA substrates of the further digestion with RNases.
RNase digestion
RNA digestion reactions with RNase II and RNase R were
performed essentially as described (21,26). PNPase degrada-
tion reactions were performed in 5 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.2),
5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl and 10 mM sodium phosphate.
Purified enzymes (1 mg) were added to 10 ml reaction mixtures
along with splicing products that were prepared by in vitro
splicing with 20 fmol of b-globin pre-mRNA. The reaction
mixtures were incubated at 37C for the indicated time. The
purified enzymes (1 mg) were also used to digest 1 mg of
human skeletal muscle total RNA (Clontech) in 10 ml at
37C for 30 min followed by ethanol precipitation; the
digestion was repeated three times in total. RNase-digested
products were extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol pre-
cipitated, and analyzed by denaturing 5.5 or 9.0% PAGE or
1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as
described previously (24).
Debranching assays
The debranching assays were performed as described
previously (27). Extracted RNAs from each RNase-digested
RNA sample were treated for 30 min at 30C with HeLa
cell S100 extract under standard splicing conditions (25).
The samples were analyzed using denaturing 9% PAGE
and autoradiography.
Oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H digestion
To prepare branch RNA, oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H
digestion was performed with the loop RNA (lariat RNA with-
out most of the 30 tail), which was prepared from in vitro
splicing reaction with human b-globin pre-mRNA followed
by RNase R digestion. The majority of RNA extracted from
RNase R digestion mixture is the loop RNA. Therefore,
extracted total RNA was digested by 0.16 U/ml of RNase H
(Takara Mirus Bio) at 37C for 30 min in the reaction mixture
containing 40 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.7), 100 mM KCl,
4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol and 8 mM synthetic
e63 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 8 PAGE 2 OF 7
oligonucleotide (TTGTAACCTTGA; Operon Biotechnolo-
gies). The RNase H-digested RNA was extracted with
phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated. This RNA was
used as substrate in RNase digestion reactions, carried out as
described above (incubation for 15 min).
Mapping of mRNA sequence of the human
dystrophin gene
To obtain the complete structure of the human dystrophin gene,
its largest cDNA sequence (accession no. NM_000109) was
mapped onto the human chromosome X, which spans the
region of chrX: 30 897 002 to chrX: 33 117 383 (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/). The exon–intron structure was defined
by the alignment of mRNA sequence with the genomic
sequence using the SIM4 program (28). We designed DNA
primers for RT–PCR based on the obtained sequences.
Detection of target RNAs by RT–PCR
The method to detect lariat introns by RT–PCR across the
branch site was reported previously (29–32). Human skeletal
muscle total RNA (1 mg; Clontech) and the RNase R-digested
RNA from the same source (1 mg) were used as templates for
the RT–PCR. To prepare the cDNAs of dystrophin mRNAs,
circular RNAs and lariat introns, the reverse transcription
reactions were performed with a reverse transcriptase (Super-
Script II: RNase H
; Invitrogen) and random hexamers in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. The reaction
mixtures (total 10 ml) containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3),
75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM each of dNTPs,
2.5 mM random hexamer primers, 1 U/ml Prime RNase inhib-
itor (Eppendorf), 10 U/ml SuperScript II: RNase H Reverse
Transcriptase, and total RNA (undigested) or RNase R-digest
template RNAs (see above) were incubated at 30C for 10 min,
at 42C for 120 min, at 50C for 30 min, at 60C for 30 min,
at 99C for 5 min, and finally kept at 4C or lower.
These intronic cDNAs were used as templates for the first
PCRs. The PCRs (in total 50 ml) containing 50 mM KCl,
10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 2 mM specific DNA primers (two kinds; see below),
0.05 U/ml Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 1 ml cDNA
solutions, were incubated for 5 min at 94C followed by
multiple PCR cycles (see below); at 94C for 30 s, at 60C
for 30 s, and at 72C for 30 s, with an incubation at 72C for
10 min at the final round. These first PCR products were
purified on a Sephacryl S300 column (Amersham Biosciences)
and used as templates for the second nested PCR. The second
PCRs were the same as the first PCRs except for using an
adjacent inner set of primers. The optimal cycle numbers of the
first and second PCRs were determined to reflect proportional
changes in the PCR products.
The sequence of DNA primers (Operon Biotechnologies)
and cycle numbers for PCRs are as follows. Detection of the
dystrophin mRNA: first PCR (20 cycles) with E7-S1 primer
(ACTGGAACATGCATTCAACATCGC) and E8-A1 primer
(CACTTTAGGTGGCCTTGGC), second PCR (10 cycles)
with E7-S2 primer (CAGGCATAGAGAAACTGCTCGAT-
CC) and E8-A2 primer (ATTTCCACTTCCTGGATGGC).
Detection of the dystrophin lariat intron 8: first PCR (25
cycles) with I8-S1 primer (ACTCTCCAACATGATATTAA-
GTGCC) and I8-A1 primer (TGTGCACGTAATACCTAAA-
AATGC), and second PCR (19 cycles) with I8-S2 primer
(CATTCTGGGAGTATACCAATTTCG) and I8-A2 primer
(AGAAAACATCTTGAATAGTAGCTGTCC). Detection of
the dystrophin lariat intron 10: first PCR (25 cycles) with
I10-S1 primer (GCCTGCTTCTGAAGAACTTGAC) and
I10-A1 primer (GTTGGAATCCCAAGCACATC), second
PCR (19 cycles) with I10-S2 primer (AAAGTGGTTTTGG-
GATTCTGC) and I10-A2 primer (GAGGAAAAAGGAT-
GACTTGCC). Detection of the dystrophin lariat intron 24:
first PCR (25 cycles) with I24-S1 primer (TTCATGCCA-
TAATAACCATTGAAC) and I24-A1 primer (GGGAGAG-
GAGAGCAAAATCC), second PCR (19 cycles) with I24-S2
primer (TTTGCAAGACTGTTAGGCAGTC) and I24-A2
primer (CCAGCTGTAAAACACTGATCTAACC). Detec-
tion of the dystrophin circular RNA: first PCR (25 cycles)
with E16-S1 primer (GCATGGCTGGATAACTTTGC) and
E3-A1 primer (TTCGAGGAGGTCTAGGAGGC), second
PCR (19 cycles) with E16-S2 primer (CGGTGTTGGGAT-
AATTTAGTCC) and E3-A2 primer (TGAAGAGGTTCTCA-
ATATGCTGC).
The amplified PCR products were analyzed using a 6%
PAGE and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To esti-
mate the enrichment factor, the PCR products were quantified
by densitometry (ImageQuant; Molecular Dynamics) and the
concentrations of total RNA samples were measured by UV
absorbance.
RESULTS
RNase R efficiently degrades linear RNA species of
in vitro splicing products
As originally characterized (23), major in vitro splicing prod-
ucts of human b-globin mini-gene transcripts are the lariat
intermediate, spliced mRNA, the first exon (exon 1), and
the lariat intron, which are well separated from unspliced
pre-mRNA by denaturing 5.5% PAGE (Figure 1A, lane 1).
We used these RNA products to test RNA degradation activity
of three E.coli 30 to 50 exoribonucleases, RNase R, RNase II
and PNPase.
RNase II partially degraded a majority of the linear RNA
species, which are unspliced pre-mRNA and spliced mRNA
(lanes 5–7). PNPase degraded these linear RNAs more effi-
ciently than RNase II, but some linear RNAs still remained
undigested even after 45 min of incubation (lanes 8–10). In
contrast, these linear RNAs are almost completely degraded
by RNase R (lanes 2–4). Since substrate specificity of these
RNases is different (21,22), it is difficult to compare absolute
activity of these RNases. Nevertheless, RNase R appears
suitable for removing abundant linear RNAs from bulk RNA
populations under this condition (using same mass of the
RNases).
These results are consistent with previous characterization
of these exoribonucleases [reviewed in (19)]. RNase II and
PNPase are sensitive to secondary structure and they pause or
dissociate at stable RNA duplexes (33–35), whereas RNase R
is particularly efficient at degrading RNA with extensive
secondary structure (21,22). Our results thus suggest that
large linear in vitro splicing products (pre-mRNA and spliced
mRNA) may contain extensive secondary structure, e.g.
partial duplex and hairpins.

RNase R-resistant RNA is a loop portion of lariat intron
Splicing products with a lariat structure, i.e. lariat intermediate
and lariat intron, were also completely removed with RNase
R. However, a novel discrete product emerged with much
higher mobility (Figure 1A, lanes 2–4). This product was
detected with all three RNases and is very stable even after
long incubation (45 min; lanes 4, 7 and 10). Since these
RNases are 30 to 50 exoribonucleases, we assumed that this
new product is the lariat RNA lacking a 30 tail.
To verify the new product, the same RNA samples were
analyzed by denaturing 9% PAGE (Figure 1B). Electro-
phoresis on a higher polyacrylamide percentage gel facilitates
the detection of a non-linear RNA fragment such as a lariat
intron with its relatively slower mobility (23,24). As expected,
we observed marked mobility shifts of the novel product
as well as the lariat intron and intermediate (lanes 11–14,
compare lanes 1–4).
Next we performed a debranching assay to confirm the
structure and length of this novel product. HeLa cell nuclear
and cytosolic S100 extracts, which contain the debranching
enzyme, cleave the 20, 50-phosphodiester bond of lariat intron
(27). Our debranching assay with S100 extract cleaved the
lariat intron and generated a linearized fragment of the expect-
ed size (130 nt; Figure 1B, land 15 and Figure 1C). The novel
product was also debranched and generated a linear intron
fragment, which matches well with the length (94 nt) of the
intron lacking the 30 portion from the branch point (Figure 1B,
lanes 16–18 and Figure 1C). Both the novel product and its
linearized fragment were purified from the gel and RT–PCR
was performed. The downstream 30 portion could not be amp-
lified and the verified sequence matched to the intron sequence
(data not shown), indicating that the novel product is indeed
the lariat intron without most of the 30 tail. We found that this
loop structure is highly resistant to exoribonucleases. It is
remarkable that the digestion of in vitro splicing products
with RNase R can isolate this particular RNA species to
near homogeneity (Figure 1A, lane 4).
RNase R degrades branch RNA
A Y-structure branch intron is generated through trans-
splicing, which corresponds to a lariat intron of a conventional
cis-splicing [reviewed in (6,7)]. We examined whether the
branch RNA is susceptible to RNase R digestion. To prepare
substrate RNA, the loop portion of a lariat intron (Figure 2A,
lane 1) was cleaved 8–19 nt downstream from the 50 splice
site using RNase H with a complementary oligonucleotide
(Figure 2A, lane 2 and Figure 2B).
Exoribonuclease RNase II digested this branch RNA almost
completely and generated a new product with faster mobility
on the gel (lane 4). This RNA product was also generated,
albeit much less, with the exoribonucleases RNase R and
PNPase (lanes 3 and 5). Based on its estimated size, we
assumed that this product is a partially degraded RNA
lacking a majority of the 20-50 linked fragment (Figure 2B).
This prediction was verified by the RT–PCR followed by
sequencing. Since RNase R could digest the branch RNA
most efficiently even with a short incubation (15 min), it
appears to be the most suitable exoribonuclease to digest
branch RNAs.
These results suggest that RNase II has lower exoribonu-
clease activity on undigested branched nucleotide(s), while
RNase R can digest the branched nucleotides more efficiently
(Figure 2B). Previously it has been demonstrated that RNase II
leaves 10 unpaired nucleotides adjacent to a duplex structure
in vitro (36). It was also shown that RNase II can generate
mature 30 termini on tRNAs in vivo (37), suggesting that
it can approach as close as 4 nt from the aminoacyl stem.
While RNase R can shorten RNA processively to di- and

tri-nucleotides, RNase II becomes more distributive when the
length of the substrate reaches 10 nt; this leaves an undi-
gested core of 3–5 nt (21). It is thus possible that RNase II
leaves a larger overhang when digesting one end of branch
RNAs, which may further interfere with digestion from the
other 30 end (Figure 2B). Alternatively, RNase R could be
digesting partially degraded branch RNA more efficiently
from its 30 ends, even when the same numbers of the 20-50
linked nucleotide(s) are left.
RNase R can be used to prepare an RNA source
containing only lariat and circular RNAs
We have demonstrated that RNase R is capable of destroying
linear and branch RNAs in vitro. Therefore in theory, exten-
sive RNase R digestion of endogenous natural RNA can pro-
duce an RNA sample that consists of only lariat and circular
RNAs. We examined this possibility by analyzing splicing
products of human dystrophin pre-mRNA using the human
total RNA from skeletal muscle. The human dystrophin
gene is the largest known gene spanning over 3 Mb with at
least 79 exons (38,39), and thus its large transcript (14 kb)
can serve as an excellent candidate to examine validity of our
method.
The general feature of a total cellular RNA is a very large
amount of rRNAs. We observed typical discrete bands of 28S/
18S rRNAs and small RNA species (including 5/5.8S rRNAs
and tRNAs) on agarose gel, and all these rRNAs were fully
degraded by RNase R (Figure 3, lanes 1 and 2).
Next we performed RT–PCR to detect specific mRNAs that
exist in much less quantity than rRNAs. We could successfully
detect human dystrophin mRNA using specific primers target-
ing their exon 7 and exon 8 in the human total RNA, whereas
we barely detected this mRNA after RNase R digestion (lanes
3 and 4). Even after RNase R digestion, extensive amplifica-
tion with more PCR cycles detected a weak signal with this
primer set; however, it appears to be derived from the circular
RNA including exons 7 and 8 (see below). Since the distance
between the 30 primer position in exon 8 and the 30 terminus of
the dystrophin mRNA is over 12.8 kb (38), our data suggest
that RNA degradation by RNase R from the 30 terminus is
quite efficient. We conclude that RNase R has the potential to
destroy a large fraction of mRNA species in a human total
RNA preparation since most mRNAs are smaller than the
dystrophin mRNA.
We then examined whether a specific lariat intron of dys-
trophin pre-mRNA exists in this RNase R-treated RNA sam-
ple. Previously it has been reported that MMLV and AMV
reverse transcriptases have the ability to read through a 20-50
linked ribonucleotide in a template RNA (29). By taking
advantage of this activity, lariat molecules of a group II intron,
retrotransposon Ty1 RNA, and Drosophila pre-mRNA intron,
were successfully detected in the total cellular RNA by
RT–PCR across the branch site (30–32). Because of the oppos-
ing direction of the two primers, this arrangement never gen-
erates PCR products from any contaminating genomic DNA.
Using this RT–PCR technique, we detected an expected lariat
form of intron 8 of the dystrophin pre-mRNA in the human
skeletal muscle total RNA (Figure 3, lane 5). We could detect
an identical fragment from the lariat intron 8 after RNase R
digestion (lane 6). Integrity of the lariat structure was also
verified by different sets of primers that cover whole loop
portion of the lariat (data not shown). Subcloning of the
RT–PCR products followed by the sequencing revealed that
the fragment contains a junction between the 50 splice site and
24 bases upstream of the 30 splice site. The position and sur-
rounding sequence of the identified branch point, CUCUA-
UCCACUCCC (branched nucleotide is underlined), was
matched to the consensus in mammalian introns (40), confirm-
ing our detection of the bona fide lariat intron 8. Using the
same approach, we also detected lariat RNAs before and after
RNase R digestion using primer sets targeting introns 10 and
Figure 2. (A) Digestions of the branch RNA with RNase R, RNase II and
PNPase. The loop portion of a lariat intron (lane 1; corresponding to Figure 1A,
lane 3) was cleaved by oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H to prepare a branch
RNA (lane 2). This branch RNA was digested with each RNase for 15 min
(lanes 3–5). The RNAs were analyzed by denaturing 9.0% PAGE. The positions
of loop RNA, branch RNA and RNase-digested products are schematically
represented by their structures. (B) Cleavage of the loop RNA by RNase H and
the degradation pathways by RNases are schematically shown.

(lanes 1 and 2). The RNA was used for RT–PCR with primers to detect the
dystrophin mRNA including exons 7 and 8 (lanes 3 and 4), three lariat introns as
indicated (lanes 5–10), and the circular RNAs including multiple exons (lanes
11 and 12). The PCR products were analyzed by native 6.0% PAGE (lanes
3–12). The structures of the lariat intron and circular RNA are schematically
represented and arrows indicate the positions of primers used for PCR.

24 of the dystrophin pre-mRNA (lanes 7–10). Quantitative
analyses revealed that total RNAs and these three lariat
RNAs remained 0.25% and 66.9% after RNase R treat-
ment, respectively. We thus estimated an enrichment factor of
268-fold. These results indicate that the lariat introns
generated by splicing of dystrophin pre-mRNA are well con-
served and highly enriched in the RNase R-digested RNA
source.
Lastly, we examined a rare circular RNA of dystrophin
pre-mRNA using our RNA source. Since the circular RNA
that contains spliced exons could be a re-spliced by-product of
corresponding exon skipping, the detection of such a special
RNA provides evidence for alternative splicing (14). Indeed, it
has been reported that eleven (out of fourteen) kinds of multi-
exon skipping in the dystrophin pre-mRNA generate circular
RNAs, including the corresponding skipped exons (16). The
50 end of the most upstream skipped exon is connected to the
30 end of the most downstream skipped exon in the circular
RNA; we thus designed the PCR primers across the connection
of these exons. Using primers for exon 3 and exon 16, we
detected the exon 3-16, 3-17 and 3-18 junctions, which are
generated from three known circular RNAs including exons
3–16, exons 3–17 and exons 3–18 [Figure 3, lane 11; (16)].
Strikingly, all these circular RNAs from the dystrophin gene
were detectable after RNase R digestion (lane 12). This
result shows that the circular RNAs, even in extremely low
amounts (16), are resistant to RNase R digestion, while the
enormously abundant linear RNAs are almost completely
digested.
DISCUSSION
It has been reported that half-lives of four mammalian nuclear
introns after splicing are relatively long, ranging from 6 to
29 min, probably due to the existence of branched structures
(41). This is probably the critical reason why spliced lariat
introns, which must be degraded eventually in vivo, are present
in total cellular RNA preparations. It is also remarkable that
rare circular RNAs generated by multi-exon skipping events
(14,16) are detected. Here we demonstrated that the RNA
population in the RNase R-treated total RNA consists of
these lariat and circular RNA molecules, preserving evidence
of constitutive and alternative splicing events.
Our results suggest the potential use of RNase R-digested
RNA source from human total RNA for an intronic cDNA
library to study global splicing profiling. To be successful for
this purpose, lariat molecules from the target genes should be
represented well enough in the RNA source so that they can be
detected by RT–PCR. We succeeded in detecting three introns
(introns 8, 10 and 24), which were arbitrarily chosen from the
dystrophin gene, in the RNase R-digested RNA prepared from
human muscle total RNA. We could also detect circular
RNAs including exons 3–16, 3–17 and 3–18, which were
generated by multi-exon skipping from exon 2 to 17, exon
2 to 18, and exon 2 to 19, respectively (16). It has been
reported that the amounts of these circular RNAs are much
less than their corresponding mRNAs (16). We expect that
intron lariats generated from splicing of dystrophin pre-mRNA
are well represented in the RNase R-digested RNA source
prepared from human muscle total RNA.
The RNase R-digested RNA source may not necessarily
guarantee coverage of all the lariat introns from rare tran-
scripts. However, this approach can be applied to the analysis
of alternative splicing events using any kind of endogenous
RNA from specific tissues or cell lines in which the mRNA
isoforms of interest are differentially expressed. As we show
in this study, such specific cellular RNAs can be treated with
RNase R to remove a vast majority of linear RNAs. This
enriched RNA source may facilitate high throughput cloning
of the lariat structures to prepare an intronic cDNA library.
Since we can directly detect excised lariat RNAs, including
either introns or exons, it may be an advantage to exclusively
analyze any kind of alternative splicing in which alternative
initiation and termination are precluded. This technology will
also be valuable for providing more branch-site mapping data
that have been lacking, and are essential for developing more
accurate computational gene prediction algorithms [reviewed
in (42)].
Our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that RNase R
degrades Y-structure RNA, whereas the loop portion of lariat
RNAs and circular RNAs are fully resistant. This feature
implies that our approach can be used to distinguish between
cis-splicing and trans-splicing of a target gene. Intragenic
trans-splicing of individual genes has been reported rarely
[(8,9) and references therein], probably because trans-splicing
would be apparent only if it would contain sequences
originating from two distinguishable alleles, or intergenic,
containing sequences from two different genes, e.g. a SL
trans-splicing [reviewed in (6,7)]. A recent genome-wide
survey suggested that the natural levels of intragenic trans-
splicing are much higher than that expected previously (43).
Our technique provides an effective tool to directly examine
an intragenic trans-splicing event by monitoring the disap-
pearance of the RT–PCR signal from Y-structure intron in
RNase R-treated RNA source. Conversely, if the signal per-
sists after RNase R digestion, this would indicate the genera-
tion of an intact lariat RNA and provide evidence of a
conventional cis-splicing event.
This is the first report to propose the potential construction
of an intronic cDNA library from an RNA source that exclu-
sively consists of lariat and circular RNAs. We have
developed a new approach that will provide complementary
information for global transcriptome analysis, such as recent
studies with human and mouse full-length cDNA libraries
(44,45).
