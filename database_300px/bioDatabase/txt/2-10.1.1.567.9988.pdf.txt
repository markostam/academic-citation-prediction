Abstract
Caspase-8 is a proapoptotic protease that suppresses neuro-
blastoma metastasis by inducing programmed cell death.
Paradoxically, caspase-8 can also promote cell migration
among nonapoptotic cells; here, we show that caspase-8 can
promote metastasis when apoptosis is compromised. Migra-
tion is enhanced by caspase-8 recruitment to the cellular
migration machinery following integrin ligation. Caspase-
8 catalytic activity is not required for caspase-8–enhanced cell
migration; rather, caspase-8 interacts with a multiprotein
complex that can include focal adhesion kinase and calpain 2
(CPN2), enhancing cleavage of focal adhesion substrates and
cell migration. Caspase-8 association with CPN2/calpastatin
disrupts calpastatin-mediated inhibition of CPN2. In vivo,
knockdown of either caspase-8 or CPN2 disrupts metastasis
among apoptosis-resistant tumors. This unexpected molecular
collaboration provides an explanation for the continued or
elevated expression of caspase-8 observed in many tumors.

Introduction
Caspase-8 is an apical protease and initiator of the extrinsic
programmed death pathway. The caspase-8 zymogen is recruited
to the death-inducing signaling complex following ligation of death
receptors, such as Fas, where it undergoes activation. The loss
of caspase-8 has been associated with increased malignancy of
neuroendocrine tumors, including neuroblastoma (1–5). We
reported previously that caspase-8–expressing neuroblastoma
exhibits increased dependence on integrins and the extracellular
matrix relative to caspase-8–lacking counterparts (6). Failure to
maintain adequate integrin-mediated extracellular matrix contacts
promoted caspase-8–dependent, and death receptor-independent,
apoptosis among invasive cells (7). This process, which we termed
‘‘integrin-mediated death,’’ acted to limit metastasis in vivo .
In turn, the results from those studies have supported the
implementation of new therapeutic regimens to caspase-8 expres-
sion within neuroblastoma tumor cells in vivo as a potential
therapeutic approach.
However, it remains unclear whether up-regulation of caspase-8
would be universally beneficial for preventing metastasis. It is
notable that a significant fraction of aggressive stage IV
neuroblastoma (10-30%) maintains caspase-8 expression and that
caspase-8 is not frequently inactivated among adult cancers, such
as carcinoma (8). Inactivating mutations are surprisingly rare (8, 9),
although it is important to note that such tumors, which develop
over many decades, frequently have other lesions that interfere
with the apoptotic cascade (10, 11). Because caspase-8 is an ini-
tiator caspase, downstream mutations common in some cancers
could well promote cell survival irrespective of caspase-8 (12).
Under such circumstances, caspase-8 may play alternative
physiologic roles within the cell. Caspase-8 has been linked to
proliferation (13–16) and to the migration in several primary and
tumor cells (17–20). Such observations imply that clinical strategies
to up-regulate caspase-8 might not be universally beneficial and
may even contribute to tumor aggressiveness. A particular concern
is the possibility that it could promote tumor cell dissemination
among apoptosis-resistant tumor cells.
Although unligated or antagonized integrins promote caspase-8
activation (7), ligated integrins suppress caspase-8 activation (21).
Ligated integrins promote assembly of the focal adhesion complex,
a signaling complex anchored by the actin cytoskeleton (22). The
focal adhesion complex contains an interacting matrix of
numerous proteins, which includes nonreceptor tyrosine kinases,
such as Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), adaptor and actin-
binding proteins, including talin and paxillin, as well as cytosolic
phosphatases and proteases (23, 24). In particular, the calpain
proteases have been implicated in the cleavage of focal adhesion
proteins that promotes focal adhesion turnover (25, 26). The high
degree of complexity of the focal adhesion reflects its physiologic
versatility in promoting signaling, survival, anchorage, and
migration. Here, we have explored the interaction between the
focal adhesion complex and caspase-8 in migration and metastasis.
Surprisingly, the ‘‘normally proapoptotic’’ enzyme caspase-8 is
found to be incorporated into focal adhesions and promotes not
only cell migration but also metastasis of apoptosis-resistant cells.

recombinant protein was from Calbiochem. 7-Amino-4-chloromethylcou-
marin and t-BOC-L-leucyl-L-methionine amide were from Molecular Probes.
Antibodies. Anti-talin NH2 terminus (MAB 1676 clone TA205),
anti-CPN2, and anti-calpastatin were purchased from Chemicon. Anti-
caspase-8 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Anti-phospho-p44/42
mitogen-activated protein kinase was from Cell Signaling. Anti-phospho-
FAK (P-Y397) was from Biosource International. Anti-FAK (C-20) and anti-
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 (C-14) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti-actin (clone AC-15) was from Sigma. Anti-myc antibody
was from Invitrogen.
Cell lines. A549 lung carcinoma cells were acquired from the American
Type Culture Collection. To create FAK-deficient and control cell lines, A549
cells were infected with a lentivirus encoding shRNA to FAK (Open
Biosystems) or a control shRNA (plasmid 1864; Addgene). The neuroblas-
toma tumor lines NB7, NB5, and NB16 were established at St. Jude
Children’s Hospital. Mouse embryo fibroblasts from Src-deficient mice
(Src/) or FAK-deficient mice (FAK/) mice were the kind gift of Dusco
Ilic. FAK/ fibroblasts reconstituted with GFP-FAK (FAK/ + FAK*) cells
were described previously (27). Cells or cell lines were maintained in either
DMEM (A549 and mouse embryo fibroblast cells) or RPMI 1640 (NB7, NB5,
and NB16) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% glutamine, and minimal amino
acids. Caspase-8–deficient NB7 neuroblastoma cells were reconstituted with
caspase-8 by retroviral transduction with a caspase-8 expression construct
as described previously (6). Knockdown of caspase-8 was accomplished by
using adenovirus-delivered caspase-8 shRNA (6) or via stable lentiviral
delivery of shRNA to caspase-8 as described previously (ref. 28; Open
Biosystems). As a control shRNA, cells were infected with a lentivirus
encoding a nonspecific shRNA sequence (plasmid 1864; Addgene).
Knockdown of caspase-3 was similarly done using the lentivirus (Open
Biosystems). Knockdown of CPN2 was done by using lentivirus (Open
Biosystems) in which the puromycin resistance cassette of the pLKO.1
vector was replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette to permit double
antibiotic selection. Calpastatin cDNA cloned into pCMV.SPORT6 vector
was amplified by PCR using SP6 and 5¶-agtcatcttttggcttgg primers to remove
the stop codon. The PCR product was subcloned into the mammalian
expression vector pcDNA3.1 myc-His using EcoRV restriction site to allow
expression of a COOH-terminal myc and polyhistidine-tagged protein.
Plasmid was transfected into NB7 cells using the Fugene system (Roche)
for 24 h.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in either
NP-40 lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 1% NP-40]
or radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1 % SDS] supplemented with complete protease
inhibitor mixture (Roche), 50 mmol/L NaF, and 1 mmol/L Na3VO4 and
centrifuged at 13,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. Protein concentration was
determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation,
500 Ag proteins were incubated with 2 Ag anti-caspase-8 antibody (BD
Biosciences) or anti-CPN2 (Chemicon) antibody overnight at 4jC.
Complexes were precipitated with 30 AL protein A/G (Pierce). Beads were
washed five times with TBS-0.1% NP-40, and bound proteins were eluted in
boiling Laemmli buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted
using specific antibodies for total FAK (anti-FAK C-20; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or calpain (Chemicon) or caspase-8 (BD Biosciences). For
the calpain-calpastatin interaction, NB7 cells were transfected with the
calpastatin myc-His construct using Fugene system (Roche). myc-His-
calpastatin was immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody, and
immunoprecipitates were then incubated for 90 min at 37jC with or
without addition 100 ng or 1 Ag recombinant human caspase-8 catalytic
domain (inactive C360A mutant). Lysates were washed once and assessed
by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-CPN2 or anti-calpastatin
antibodies.
Adhesion-dependent signaling. Neuroblastoma cells were serum
starved for 6 h, placed in suspension for 15 min in ice (representing the
0 time point), or plated into 100 mm non-tissue culture-treated dishes
(1  106 per 100 mm dish) precoated with extracellular matrix proteins
(2 Ag/mL fibronectin, 2 Ag/mL vitronectin, or 10 Ag/mL collagen). Cells
were allowed to attach for the times as indicated. At each time point,
adherent cells were directly lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
as described above. Where indicated, cells were incubated in the presence
of ALLM (50 Amol/L) or calpastatin peptide (2 Amol/L) before (20 min) and
during cell adhesion. PBS vehicle served as a control. The adenovirus
mediating delivery of caspase-8 small interfering RNA, or an empty type 5
adenoviral vector (pAd Easy), was added to the cells 72 h before and during
cell adhesion (6). Cells lysates were analyzed by Western blot as above
described for the specific antibodies.
Focal adhesion enrichment and isolation. The assay was done after
that described by Kaplan et al. (29). Briefly, cells were plated onto
fibronectin-coated plates as described for the cell signaling assay. At the
times indicated, adherent cells were preextracted with 0.5% Triton X-100
lysis buffer for 0.5 h; this fraction is clarified by centrifugation to remove
nuclei and is called the cytosolic fraction (500  g , 5 min). The focal
adhesion enriched fraction was prepared from the remaining cell fraction
bound (adhesion complex) on the plate, which was lysed in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay buffer for 5 min on ice, and scraped off the
dish. This fraction is clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 14000  g ) to
remove contaminating nuclear material. Lysates from the two different
fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting.
Tumor growth and metastasis. Neuroblastoma cells (5  106)
suspended in 40 AL complete medium were seeded on 11-day-old chick
chorioallantoic membrane. Tumors were left to develop for 8 days and then
resected and weighed as determined previously (6). The metastasis assays
were done by seeding 7  106 cells onto the surface of the chick
chorioallantoic membrane and assessing the presence of metastases in
lungs and bone marrow by amplification of a human-specific Alu sequence
as reported previously (6).
Migration assays. Cell migration was done using a variant of the
wounding as described previously (20) or a Transwell assay using modified
Boyden chambers, 6.5 mm diameter, 8 Am pore size (Transwell; Costar),
according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, the bottom sides of
the inserts were coated with fibronectin (2 Ag/mL). Cells (5  105) were
plated in the top chamber of Transwell inserts and serum-free medium was
added to the bottom chamber. After 4 h, stationary cells were removed from
the top side of the membrane, whereas migrated cells in the bottom side of
the inserts were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 2% ethanol. Dye was
eluted with methanol, and absorbance was measured at 600 nm.
Calpain activity assay in living cells. NB7 or NB7-C8 cells were plated
in 96-well multiwell plate precoated with fibronectin (2 Ag/mL) at
concentration of 25,000 per well for 10 min. Calpain activity was evaluated
after the times as indicated by incubating the cells with the cell-
permeable calpain fluorogenic substrate t-BOC-L-leucyl-L-methionine amide
(10 Amol/L) and measuring the fluorescence with the TECAN Geniios Pro
fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelength of 350 and 460 nm,
respectively. As a control, cells are incubated with the solubilizing vehicle
(DMSO).
Immunofluorescence studies. Cells were permitted to attach to
coverslips coated with fibronectin (2 Ag/mL) for 1 h, such that they were
confluent. Cell monolayer was then wounded with a pipette tip and cells
were allowed to begin to migrate into the wound for 1 h. Alternatively, cells
were plated at subconfluence and allowed to migrate randomly. In either
case, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized
in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, and blocked for 60 min at
room temperature with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then
stained with monoclonal antibody to caspase-8 (BD Biosciences; 1:100) for
1 h. After washing several times in PBS/bovine serum albumin, the cells
were exposed to secondary antibody specific for mouse [1:300; Alexa 488
(green) or 565 (red); Invitrogen]. Samples were mounted in Vectashield hard
set mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse
C1 confocal microscope.
One-dimensional gel-based ABPP of focal adhesion and cytosolic
fractions. Standard conditions for ABPP reactions were as follows: cytosolic
and focal adhesion proteomes were adjusted to a final protein concentra-
tion of 0.6 mg/mL in 25 AL PBS (pH 7.4) and treated with 1 Amol/L AB19-
bodipy-TMR (caspase-8 probe) or 1 Amol/L DCG-04-bodipy-TMR (calpain
probe) for 30 min at 37jC as described previously (30, 31). Reactions were

quenched with 1 volume of standard 4 SDS-PAGE loading buffer
(reducing) and separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels (10%
acrylamide). Fluorescently labeled proteins were visualized in-gel with a
Hitachi FMBio IIe flatbed fluorescence scanner (MiraiBio).
Statistical analysis. Where pertinent, results were compared using
unpaired t tests of at least three independent experiments or ANOVA as
indicated. P < 0.05 was considered significant. For the in vivo studies,
statistical power was realized by evaluating cohorts including all animals
from all experiments by m2 and Mann-Whitney statistical tests as described
previously (6).
Results
Caspase-8 promotes metastasis among caspase-3-deficient
cells. Caspase-8 has been implicated in the suppression of
neuroblastoma metastasis via the induction of apoptosis among
invasive cells (6), consistent with loss of caspase-8 in the majority
of aggressive neuroblastoma (4). However, caspase-8 can promote
cell migration via localization to the cell periphery and activation
of small GTPases and calpain (17). These results suggest that
caspase-8 may promote metastasis, particularly when apoptosis is
compromised. To test this, we used a shRNA approach to suppress
expression of caspase-3, a critical downstream effector of caspase-
8–mediated killing (32) and other forms of apoptosis (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1). Caspase-3 expression was suppressed in NB7
neuroblastoma cells reconstituted with caspase-8 (NB7-C8) and
tumor growth and metastasis was assessed in the chorioallantoic
membrane model that previously established a metastasis
suppressor role for caspase-8 (6).
Caspase-3 knockdown (Fig. 1A) did not significantly affect
neuroblastoma proliferation in vitro6 or tumor growth in vivo
(Fig. 1B). Loss of caspase-3 did not appreciably affect metastasis of
NB7 neuroblastoma deficient for caspase-8 (Fig. 1C , compare right
open and left filled columns) but rescued metastasis among tumors
expressing caspase-8 (+; P < 0.001, compare middle filled and open
columns). Surprisingly, a disproportionate increase in metastasis
was observed; Casp8+Casp3 cells disseminated more efficiently
than neuroblastoma lacking both caspases (P < 0.05; Fig. 1C). As
expected, the Casp8+Casp3+ tumors exhibited the lowest overall
incidence of metastasis (Fig. 1C, left open column), confirming that
caspase-8 blocks metastasis when an intact caspase cascade is
present (6). Together, the results indicated that caspase-8, a putative
metastasis suppressor, could act to promote tumor dissemination
among populations of ‘‘apoptosis-compromised’’ cells.
Supporting this notion, caspase-8 promotes neuroblastoma
migration under nonapoptotic condition in vitro (Fig. 2A ;
refs. 18–20). Similarly, shRNA-based knockdown of caspase-8 trans-
gene expression in the NB7-C8 cells or knockdown of endogenous
caspase-8 expression in A549 carcinoma cells decreases cell
migration relative to cells treated with control shRNA (Fig. 2B).
The caspase-8 shRNA had no effect on caspase-8–deficient cells
(Fig. 2B). Collectively, the results support a general role for caspase-
8 in supporting cell migration; accordingly, we find that caspase-8 is
enriched in the leading edge among randomly migrating cells
(Fig. 2C ; ref. 20). These results were extended using confocal
microscopy; caspase-8 was found to be enriched among cells
entering a wound in both pseudopods (Fig. 2D, top) and lamella
(Fig. 2D, bottom).
Caspase-8–dependent alterations are observed in talin
following substrate adhesion. Caspase-8 localizes to different
cellular compartments and may be targeted based on post-
translational modification (9, 33, 34). Caspase-8 can colocalize

with integrins (7) and can be activated (promoting apoptosis) when
integrins are antagonized or unligated (6, 7). Because integrin-
mediated adhesion protects cells from caspase-8–mediated apo-
ptosis (21), and caspase-8 is phosphorylated following attachment
to fibronectin (20), we speculated that caspase-8 might also
associate with nascent focal adhesions, thereby influencing cell
migration. Therefore, NB7 cells deficient or reconstituted for
caspase-8 were replated onto fibronectin substrate to activate
integrin signaling, and the activation of integrin downstream
signaling molecules was evaluated as a function of time by
immunoblot analysis. However, we detected no differences in the
activation of the integrin-proximal nonreceptor tyrosine kinase
FAK or in the activation of the downstream target ERK (Fig. 3A).
In contrast, differences were evident in the appearance of the
integrin-associated cytoskeletal protein talin during substrate
adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 3A) or collagen or vitronectin
substrates (Supplementary Fig. S2A) in the caspase-8–expressing
or caspase-8–deficient NB7 cells. In particular, caspase-8–express-
ing cells showed enhanced production of the NH2-terminal talin
fragment (35) during substrate attachment. This fragment contains
the integrin-binding region of talin known as the FERM domain.
Binding of the FERM domain to integrins enhances their binding to
ligand, thus influencing cell migration (25, 36–38). Accordingly,
knockdown of caspase-8 expression via shRNA blocked the
production of the FERM domain fragment following substrate
adhesion (Fig. 3B ; Supplementary Fig. S2B) and inhibited cell
migration (see Fig. 2B). Together, the results implicate caspase-8 as
a talin-dependent regulator of cell motility. Nonetheless, caspase-
8 did not appear to cleave talin directly, as we were unable to
show cleavage of talin immunoprecipitates by recombinant
caspase-8 in vitro (data not shown). This was not completely
surprising because caspase-8 activity is influenced by steric or
allosteric factors as well as post-translational modifications
(18, 20, 39–41). For example, Src-mediated phosphorylation inhibits
caspase-8 activation (41). Moreover, these results were consistent
with our prior observations that a proteolysis-deficient mutant of
caspase-8, in which the tyrosine in position 360 has been
substituted to alanine (caspase-8 C360A), promotes caspase-
8 targeting to the cell periphery and migration (20).
Talin is an integral member of the focal adhesion complex
assembled following integrin ligation, and competition for available
talin within a cell limits integrin activity (38). When focal adhesion-
containing fractions were purified (29) from cells expressing or
lacking caspase-8, we found no obvious differences in focal
adhesion-associated talin holoprotein but selectively observed
accumulation of the FERM domain fragment specifically within
Figure 2. Caspase-8 influences cell migration. A, NB7
neuroblastoma cells deficient in caspase-8 (- Caspase 8)

were assessed for their ability to migrate on increasing
concentrations of collagen substrate in a Transwell
Boyden chamber system as described in Materials
and Methods. Migrated cells were fixed and stained
with crystal violet and extracted dye was quantitated
(absorbance 600 nm). Mean F SE from six
determinations in a representative assay. B, NB7 cells
expressing or lacking caspase-8 or A549 carcinoma
cells expressing endogenous caspase-8 were infected
with either control nonspecific shRNA lentivirus or
lentivirus encoding shRNA to caspase-8 to knock down
caspase-8 (immunoblots shown). Cells were evaluated
for their capacity to migrate using a wound assay, and
alterations in cell migration were plotted. NB7 did not
significantly vary in migration when treated with the
caspase-8 shRNA, whereas NB7-C8 and A549 exhibited
decreased wound closure (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, t test,
respectively). C, localization of caspase-8 in A549 cells

focal adhesion of caspase-8–expressing cells (Fig. 3C). The caspase-8
zymogen was also observed (f56 kDa), whereas FAK and ERK
accumulated independent of caspase-8 expression (Fig. 3C).
Caspase-8 promotes calpain activity within focal adhesions.
To identify the protease responsible for mediating talin cleavage,
we used an activity-based profiling approach, probing for the
activity of caspases and calpains (42). The caspase-selective probes
used (such as caspase-8–selective probe AB19-BTMX) detected no
signal in either cytosolic or focal adhesion cell fractions
(Supplementary Fig. S3). However, the activity-based probe DCG-
04, a calpain selective probe, was incorporated strongly within focal
adhesion fractions of NB7 cells reconstituted for caspase-8 expres-
sion, identifying a putative protease of f72 kDa (Fig. 4A , arrow).
Similar results were obtained in NB5 neuroblastoma cells
expressing endogenous caspase-8, and the 72 kDa signal was
eliminated by knockdown of caspase-8 expression (Supplementary
Fig. S3). These results are in agreement with reports that (a)

the times and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and the expression
of FAK, ERK, and phosphorylated forms of these proteins was evaluated by
immunoblotting (top ). Immunoblotting was similarly done to assess the presence
of talin as well as the NH2-terminal FERM cleavage product (bottom ).
B, immunoblot analysis of talin was done in NB7 caspase-8–reconstituted
cells and shRNA knockdown cells. C, focal adhesion fractions were purified
from NB7 neuroblastoma cells lacking or expressing caspase-8. Cells were
allowed to attach for 30 or 60 min, and 25 Ag protein was subjected to
immunoblot analysis for the presence of FAK and pFAK, ERK and pERK,
and talin.

A, isolated focal adhesion (FA ) or cytosolic (Cyt ) fractions were incubated with
the cysteine protease probe DCG-04, which reacts with active calpain, and
20 Ag of each lysate were then resolved by electrophoresis and DCG-04 reactive
proteins resolve. B, focal adhesion and cytosolic fractions were assessed
to detect calpain substrate cleavage. Calpain substrates tested included
CPN2 (to evaluate production of the autocatalytic fragment) and the CPN2
substrate a-II spectrin. C, NB7 cells lacking (open squares ) or reconstituted
for caspase-8 (filled squares ) were plated on fibronectin (2 Ag/mL) in the
presence of a calpain-activated fluorescent substrate (t -BOC-L-leucyl-L-
methionine amide), and fluorescence was recorded as a function of time. Calpain
activity induced by attachment from a representative experiment. D, immunoblot
analysis of the effect of ALLM, an inhibitor of CPN2, on talin cleavage induced
by substrate adhesion was done as described in Fig. 3 above.

CPN2-mediated talin cleavage regulates focal complex turnover
and cell migration (35) and (b) calpains regulate caspase-8–
mediated motility (19). Supporting the concept that CPN2 activity
was elevated in focal adhesions, we observed cleavage of calpain
substrates, such as a-II spectrin, and an autoprocessed form of
CPN2 selectively in focal adhesions (open arrowhead) but not in the
cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4B). Fluorometric substrate cleavage assay
using live cells showed increased calpain activity selectively among
NB7-C8 cells during substrate attachment (Fig. 4C). The peptidyl
protease inhibitor, ALLM, can block cell migration via inhibition of
CPN2 (ref. 43; data not shown). In agreement with the notion that
talin cleavage facilitates migration, we find that ALLM treatment
also suppressed substrate attachment-induced cleavage of talin
(Fig. 4D). Similar results were seen with calpeptin, another peptidyl
inhibitor of calpain (derived from the endogenous calpain inhibitor,
calpastatin; Supplementary Fig. S4A). These results support the
proposed role of calpain as an effector of caspase-8–mediated
motility (19) and extend these results by localizing the activity to
nascent focal adhesion/cytoskeletal complexes initiated by integ-
rin-substrate ligation.
Caspase-8 associates with CPN2 and FAK. The focal adhesion
targeting of CPN2 has been proposed to occur via a scaffolding
function of FAK, with CPN2 binding near the FAK-Y397 phos-
phorylation site (24). Because caspase-8 associates with FAK-
associated SH2-containing proteins such as Src and p85a
(18, 20), we tested whether caspase-8 and CPN2 might be
present within the same molecular complex. NB7 cells recon-
stituted for caspase-8 expression were kept in suspension or
Figure 5. Caspase-8 is targeted to the periphery in a FAK-dependent manner. A, NB7 cells reconstituted for caspase-8 in suspension (Susp ) or those allowed to
attach to fibronectin (2 Ag/mL; Attach ) for 30 min were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation of caspase-8. Whole-cell lysate and nonspecific beads + antibody
control was done in parallel, and all samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis for total FAK, caspase-8, and CPN2. B, mouse embryo fibroblasts from
Src-deficient mice (Src/), FAK-deficient mice (FAK/), or FAK/ fibroblasts reconstituted with GFP-FAK (FAK/ + FAK*) were allowed to attach to fibronectin
substrate, lysed, and subjected to caspase-8 immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of total FAK, caspase-8, and CPN2 (tagged FAK
is resolved as a higher molecular weight species). C, A549 cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding a scrambled shRNA (Control ) or a FAK shRNA (FAK ) to
knock down FAK (left, immunoblot inset ). Cells were allowed to attach and spread on fibronectin-coated (2 Ag/mL) surfaces and stained for actin (blue ; arrows, actin
ruffles) and caspase-8 (red to show caspase-8 distribution) and images by confocal microscopy. Bar , 10 Am. Spreading cells were scored for the presence of enriched
caspase-8 by blinded observers (150 cells per group; left). P < 0.012. D, NB7 expressing or lacking caspase-8 were allowed to attach and lysed and CPN2 complexes
were immunoprecipitated. Complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and assessed for the presence of calpastatin and caspase-8. E, His-calpastatin was overexpressed
in NB7, and pull-downs were done with Nickel NTA resin. Lysates were incubated in the presence of GST (Con ) or with 100 ng or 1 Ag of the catalytic domain of
caspase-8 (catalytically inactive C360A mutant), washed, and resolved. The presence of calpastatin and CPN2 was determined by immunoblotting.

permitted to attach to fibronectin (2 Ag/mL) for 30 min and cell
lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-caspase-8 antibody
(BD Biosciences) and subjected to immunoblot analysis for total
FAK (anti-FAK C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or calpain
(Chemicon) or caspase-8 (BD Biosciences).
Coprecipitation analysis revealed that CPN2 and caspase-8
associated with each other and with FAK selectively following
substrate adhesion but not among suspended cells (Fig. 5A). The
induced association following substrate adhesion suggested a role
for the focal adhesion complex in assembling the caspase-8/CPN2
containing complex. Surprisingly, however, we found that caspase-
8 and CPN2 could associate in FAK/ cells, suggesting that FAK
was not essential (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the kinase c-Src, which
associates with both caspase-8 and FAK, was not necessary for
caspase-8/CPN2 association or the formation of the FAK/caspase-8/
CPN2 complex (Fig. 5B). However, FAK was important for caspase-
8 distribution, because mouse embryo fibroblast cells lacking FAK
had disrupted localization of caspase-8 in the periphery (Supple-
mentary Fig. S5A), whereas reconstituted cells exhibited normal
peripheral localization of caspase-8. Similarly, we assessed the
distribution of caspase-8 among A549 cells in which FAK has been
knocked down (f80-90%; Fig. 5C, inset). Among similarly spread
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B), we found that the distribution of
caspase-8 in the membrane ruffles was compromised in FAK
knockdown cells relative to control A549 (Fig. 5C), and this was not
simply time-dependent, because FAK/ cells do not show
enhanced peripheral caspase-8 localization at later time points
(data not shown; Supplementary Fig. S5B). Thus, FAK appears to
play a role in localizing caspase-8 to the periphery among spreading
cells.
We next examined how caspase-8 association with CPN2 or with
focal adhesions might influence calpain activity. The principle
regulator of calpain activity in living cells is calpastatin (37).
Interestingly, calpastatin cleavage was enhanced in the focal
adhesion fraction of NB7-C8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Although caspase-8 did not cleave calpastatin in vitro (data not
shown), active calpains can cleave calpastatin, and the observed
products were consistentwith those previously described for calpain
cleavage. Calpastatin binds calpain via its NH2-terminal domain (44)
and via three distinct conserved peptide sequences within its
‘‘calpastatin repeats,’’ each of which is required for effective
inhibition of the enzyme (45). Physiologically, the activation of
calpain requires displacement of calpastatin and association with
targeting or anchoring proteins (46). Therefore, CPN2 or calpastatin
binding to caspase-8 might act to disrupt the calpastatin-CPN2
interaction.
To test this possibility, we examined immunoprecipitates of
calpain from cells expressing or lacking caspase-8. Calpastatin was
readily detected coprecipitating with CPN2 in lysates from cells
lacking caspase-8 but was nearly absent in lysates derived from
cells expressing caspase-8 (Fig. 5D). This suggested that caspase-8
prevented formation of a CPN2-calpastatin complex. To determine
if this was a direct effect, we then added back recombinant
caspase-8 (C360A mutant, inactive) to the precipitated calpastatin
complexes. The addition of recombinant caspase-8 disrupted the
preexisting calpain-calpastatin complex (Fig. 5D, lanes 4 and 5),
indicating that caspase-8 antagonizes calpastatin-CPN2 interaction
and further suggesting that caspase-8–enhanced migration and
metastasis was effected by CPN2.
CPN2 is crucial for promotion of migration and metastasis
by caspase-8. To address this, we first knocked down the
expression of CPN2 (via shRNA) in caspase-8–deficient or
caspase-8–expressing NB7 cells already bearing a C3 knockdown
(creating a double-knockdown phenotype; Fig. 6A). Assessing
these cells, we found that the Casp8+Casp3CPN2 cells
exhibited decreased talin cleavage following substrate attach-
ment, similar to caspase-8–deficient cells, whereas Casp8+Casp3
cells expressing a control shRNA exhibited talin cleavage
following substrate attachment (Fig. 6B). To determine whether
there was a selective effect on migration, we next assessed mi-
gration in vitro among the CPN2 knockdown cells (Fig. 6B, left).
Interestingly, the knockdown of CPN2 had a greater effect on
the migration on fibronectin substrate of caspase-8–expressing
cells relative to caspase-8–deficient cells. This suggested that
knockdown of CPN2 might also decrease tumor metastasis of
caspase-8–expressing cells in vivo . Evaluating this possibility,
we found that suppression of CPN2 decreased the incidence of
metastasis selectively among caspase-8–expressing cells (Fig. 6C,
left). Together, these results extend prior suggestions that
Figure 6. CPN2 knockdown compromises talin cleavage, migration, and
metastasis. A, CPN2 was knocked down in the paired C3-silenced NB7 cells
expressing or deficient for caspase-8. B, CPN2 knockdown cells were allowed
to attach to fibronectin substrate and talin cleavage was assessed by
immunoblotting. C, change in wound closure after 24 h of migration following
calpain knockdown in NB7 cells expressing or deficient for caspase-8 was
assessed via Boyden chamber assay for their ability to migrate on fibronectin
substrate (2 Ag/mL; left ). Mean F SE from six determinations in a representative
assay. *, P < 0.05. Metastasis assays were done in the chick chorioallantoic
membrane and relative change in metastasis incidence was plotted. Data are

caspase-8–induced migration was dependent on CPN2 (19) and

among apoptosis-resistant tumors.
Discussion
Tumors can become apoptosis-resistant via many mechanisms,
including the expression of mitochondrial gatekeeper proteins of
the Bcl-2 family, overexpression of inhibitors of apoptosis, or lost
expression of caspases, such as caspase-8, caspase-9, or caspase-3.
Here, we examined the metastasis of neuroblastoma cells in which
we compromised caspase-8–mediated killing by silencing the
expression of the downstream effector caspase-3. The studies
showed that disruption of caspase-3 in the apoptotic cascade could
not only relieve the metastasis-suppressing activity of caspase-8 but
also further revealed an unexpected metastasis-enhancing property
due to caspase-8 expression. Examining the mechanism by which
this occurred, we found that caspase-8 promoted cell migration
independent of its proteolytic activity, via recruitment to a complex
that contained FAK, and CPN2. Caspase-8 disrupted the interaction
of calpastatin with calpain and permitted activation of CPN2. In
turn, this promoted CPN2 cleavage of focal adhesion substrates
and subsequent cell migration (43). Accordingly, knockdown of
CPN2 inhibited caspase-8–initiated metastasis. Our results show
that the recruitment of caspase-8 to the focal complex regulates
both cell migration and calpain activity (19). The capacity of
caspase-8 to increase migration and metastasis may be clinically
relevant; these nonapoptotic roles of caspase-8 suggest caution be
used in strategies that seek to amplify caspase-8 expression.
The lackof apoptosis induced by enrichedperipheral caspase-8may
be due to allosteric limitations present within the tightly packed
focal adhesion complex or may result from posttranslational
modifications such as phosphorylation of caspase-8 on Y380 by Src
(41). Indeed, these events may not be easily dissociable, because
recruitment of caspase-8 to the periphery of cells attaching to
substrate is abnormal in the absence of FAK (Fig. 5). Together with
previous studies, our results suggest that extracellular matrix
adhesion may trigger post-translational modification of caspase-8,
permitting caspase-8 to play a nonapoptotic role as a promoter of
cell migration. This is of particular interest, because Serial Analysis of
Gene Expression analysis suggests that increased caspase-8
expression may occur in bladder, liver, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate,
and (non-small cell lung carcinoma) lung cancers (47).
The capacity for caspase-8 to interact with a cytoskeletal
complex and influence cell behavior may be noteworthy with
respect to prior studies. Many ‘‘nonapoptotic’’ cellular processes
that have been found to be disrupted in caspase-8–deficient
animals, such as T-cell activation (48, 49), have well-documented
requirements for talin and integrin (50). Other ‘‘nonapoptotic’’
caspase-8 activities, such as activation of nuclear factor-nB (51) or
the small GTPase Rac (19), similarly link caspase-8 signaling to
integrins and the cytoskeleton. Further, cell adhesion and
cytoskeletal rearrangements are linked with resistance to apoptosis
(34, 52, 53). Although resistance can be related to transcriptional
events and downstream modulation of apoptosis-regulating
proteins (at least in some cases), our results provide a basis for
exploring how early signaling events elicited by integrin-ligand
interactions can directly contribute to the regulation of caspase
cascade initiation. The apparent linkage between apoptosis and
cellular cytoskeletal dynamics appears to be physiologically
convenient; integrins act as biosensors that physically interrogate
the local microenvironment and thus are well-poised to help guide
cell fate decisions.
It is also important to consider that caspases represent clinically
relevant targets. Although current strategies are focused on
stimulating or inhibiting the caspase catalytic activity, the potential
for noncatalytic function is likely to be important in future
therapeutic considerations. Our results would strongly suggest that
retention of caspase-8 may be ‘‘contextually’’ advantageous to a
tumor cell, particularly those bearing downstream disruptions
within the programmed cell death pathway. With respect to this, it
is possible that current clinical trials that seek to up-regulate
caspase-8 expression might, under some circumstances, exacerbate
disease and promote metastasis. In addition to placing patients at
risk, this could act to mask efficacy within statistical cohorts.
However, an increased understanding of the molecular mecha-
nisms involved in regulating this process would be predicted to
provide new targets for use in personalized, and combinatorial,
therapeutic approaches.
