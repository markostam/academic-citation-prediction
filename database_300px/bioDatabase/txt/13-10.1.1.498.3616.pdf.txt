ABSTRACT
The Rat Genome Database (RGD, http://rgd.mcw.
edu) was developed to provide a core resource for
rat researchers combining genetic, genomic, path-
way, phenotype and strain information with a focus
on disease. RGD users are provided with access to
structured and curated data from the molecular
level through to the level of the whole organism,
including the variations associated with disease
phenotypes. To fully support use of the rat as a
translational model for biological systems and
human disease, RGD continues to curate these
datasets while enhancing and developing tools to
allow efficient and effective access to the data in a
variety of formats including linear genome viewers,
pathway diagrams and biological ontologies. To
support pathophysiological analysis of data, RGD
Disease Portals provide an entryway to integrated
gene, QTL and strain data specific to a particular
disease. In addition to tool and content develop-
ment and maintenance, RGD promotes rat research
and provides user education by creating and dis-
seminating tutorials on the curated datasets, sub-
mission processes, and tools available at RGD. By
curating, storing, integrating, visualizing and pro-
moting rat data, RGD ensures that the investment
made into rat genomics and genetics can be lever-
aged by all interested investigators.
INTRODUCTION
The Rat Genome Database (RGD, http://rgd.mcw.edu) is
the model organism database for the laboratory rat,
Rattus norvegicus. The rat is a widely studied animal
model for physiology, pharmacology, toxicology, nutri-
tion, behavior, immunology and neoplasia (1). The biolog-
ical relevance and wealth of phenotypic data that exists for
the rat, when combined with genomic resources, provide
the opportunity to accelerate the development of new
diagnostic, preventative and treatment approaches in
each of these ﬁelds. The primary goal of RGD is to pro-
vide support for researchers using the rat as a model
organism in which to understand human health and dis-
ease through disease-oriented translational research.
In order to fulﬁll this goal, RGD provides a compre-
hensive, curated and integrated system for exploring geno-
mic, genetic and phenotypic data across the many strains
and substrains of rats. Core genomic and genetic datasets,
including sequences, genes, mapping information, strains
and quantitative trait loci, are acquired from a variety of
sources (literature, other scientiﬁc databases and via local
bioinformatic analyses).
Access to these datasets is provided using a variety of
internally developed or externally developed and modiﬁed
tools. These tools provide access to data within a genomic
context, in a genome viewer or browser, as well as through
report pages, which provide comprehensive, curated and
updated reports on the speciﬁc feature queried, with links
to a wealth of supplementary information including ortho-
logs, references and physical interactions. In addition,
RGD has recently begun curating and adding interactive
pathway diagrams, providing links to detailed, expert
curated information on the proteins involved in the path-
ways, the relationships between them, small molecules
interactions, and links to related pathways.
RGD places signiﬁcant focus on integration between
core genetic and genomic datasets and phenotypic or
pathogenic disease data. In order to simplify access to
disease-associated datasets, RGD created a number of

disease portals; entry points for researchers to access data
related to a disease of interest, and links to tools display-
ing the genomic and genetic context of the data. To com-
plement these disease portals, a Phenotypes and Models
Portal was created at RGD to house strain and phenotype
data along with tools to integrate the genomic and phe-
notypic datasets. Integration of large phenotype datasets
from many rat strains is based on implementation of a
variety of biological ontologies; more complex data struc-
tures are used to support integration of multiple ontology
annotations, as well as qualiﬁers and actual values.
DATA ACCESS AND DATABASE STRUCTURE
The public website provides convenient access to this data
through recently updated search tools, web page reports
on genes, strains, QTLs and ontologies, and via specia-
lized analysis and visualization tools. RGD data available
via the website is updated daily. In addition, data curated
at RGD is made available through other global genomics
resources such as NCBI Ensembl and UCSC. Selected
larger datasets are made available to high-throughput
users via FTP.
RGD is built and deployed on a Sun Solaris platform.
The website is powered by a content management system
called SimpleCMS. Dynamic content is delivered through
Java and Perl applications deployed on an Apache Web
Server and Tomcat Servlet Container with an Oracle 10g
database. Data pipelines were built as Java applications
using the Spring framework.
RGD CORE GENOMIC DATASETS
RGD continues to acquire and integrate core genomic
datasets (e.g. gene models, QTL, sequence and map
data). The last year has seen signiﬁcant growth in all the
core curated datasets (Table 1).
Automated pipelines, manual procedures and submis-
sions from the research community provide RGD users
with the most complete catalogue of rat genomic, genetic
and protein information available. The rat gene catalogue
and human and mouse homolog data is updated via
weekly automated EntrezGene pipelines. An automated
pipeline updated ortholog relationships, and a nomencla-
ture pipeline, which compares symbols and names among
the rat, human and mouse, alerts curators to naming dis-
crepancies. Various other automated pipelines, for exam-
ple the Microarray probe set identiﬁers for Aﬀymetrix,
and Agilent run daily or weekly to ensure presentation
of the latest data.
Within the last year, additional core genomic datasets
have been incorporated into RGD. As in human and other
model organisms, SNPs are becoming the dominant
genetic marker in the rat. SNPs have been incorporated
into RGD using two tools. The RGD Genome Browser
(GBrowse), implemented using the highly successful
Generic Model Organism System Database Project
(GMOD) generic genome browser (2), oﬀers SNP tracks
for SNPs catalogued at NCBI’s dbSNP and Ensemble
(Figure 1), and SNPs from the STAR project (3) have
been incorporated into the RGD SNPlotyper tool for hap-
lotype analysis (Figure 1). Advances in the methodology
for miRNA gene prediction have led to an expansion in
the number of miRNA gene annotations in many organ-
isms including the rat. Rather than curating these genes
ourselves, RGD obtains the core annotations from
miRBase, the Sanger Institute’s repository for published
miRNA sequences and annotation (4), and provide this
data as a track in Gbrowse with links back to miRBase. In
addition to miRNAs, RGD has incorporated a GBrowse
track depicting and providing annotation on a variety of
additional classes of rat ncRNAs, including small nucleo-
lar (sno)RNAs, and small nuclear (sn)RNAs, sourced
from the non-coding database NONCODE (5).
TOOL DEVELOPMENT
The volume and complexity of genomic data currently
available for the rat poses a major challenge for explora-
tion and visualization by biomedical researchers. In the
last year, RGD has made enhancements to a number of
tools to support and simplify researcher’s exploration
of these datasets. Improved search and display tools,
extended ontologies and increased interoperability
between existing tools are some of the features that will
help scientists streamline their research. These changes
have, in large part, been guided by the desire to identify
and use rat strain data in the study of disease traits, with
subsequent translation of this information to humans
both for disease prevention and drug targeting.
SEARCH
RGD released a new site search in August 2008, allowing
users to ﬁnd objects in RGD based on keyword or posi-
tion information. Over 8.5 million terms within RGD
have been ranked and indexed to return genes, QTLs,
strains, markers and references housed at RGD. Search
results are presented in an easy-to-use report format that
includes position information along with additional ﬁelds
speciﬁc to the genomic object type. Genomic objects
have been indexed for the rat, mouse and human to
allow for comparison between species. In addition, ontol-
ogy term matches in the Gene (GO), Disease, Pathway
and Mammalian Phenotype ontologies are returned by
each search. This new site search provides the ability to
search on multiple terms, as well as exclusion of common
words, stemming, phrase searches and negative terms.

All data in RGD is indexed and ranked to ensure correct
positioning of objects in the search result list. Customiza-
tion to a speciﬁc assembly is available by selecting one of
the assembly maps available for each species. Search
results can be exported by downloading results as a CSV
or tab delimited ﬁle and viewed on the RGD GViewer
using a species-speciﬁc map.
GENOME BROWSER
The RGD GBrowse has undergone a variety of enhance-
ments in the last year, achieved in part through implemen-
tation of GBrowse version 1.69 (2). Features in this
enhanced version can be found at http://gmod.org/wiki/
GMOD_News. The RGD GBrowse now displays popup
balloons when the user hovers over a genomic object;
these are used to provide object and track speciﬁc sum-
marized annotation and links to other internal and exter-
nal applications (Figure 1). Within a number of tracks, we
have provided color coding based on the genic/genomic
location of the object; this allows users, for example, to
scan the genome and diﬀerentiate between coding and
intergenic SNPs (Figure 1).
Additional SNP visualizations are available from
GBrowse by following links to the RGD SNPlotyper
tool (Figure 1). Having identiﬁed a SNP or region of
interest through examination of annotation and genomic
context in GBrowse, RGD users can investigate the geno-
type of speciﬁc rat strains of interest in this region by
selecting and sending the region in question to the
SNPlotyper tool which returns a visualization of the gen-
otype across selected commonly used strains.
PATHWAYS
As part of the continuous eﬀort to add new dimensions
and depth to the pathway ontologies and associated data,
RGD has begun publishing interactive diagrams for
selected pathways using the Pathway Studio software
developed by Ariadne Genomics (6). The diagrams oﬀer
an instant ‘snapshot’ of a pathway’s components and the
relationships between them (Figure 2) and include direct
links to RGD gene report pages. In addition to the links to
the RGD gene reports, a brief overview of each pathway is
provided as well as a link to the pathways ontology report
including the complete list of annotated genes involved in
Figure 1. GBrowse showing new tracks, popup with summarized annotation, color coding and reﬁned links.

the pathway and the ability to download this information.
As applicable, the diagrams also point to downstream
activated pathways providing the ability to ‘walk’ from
one pathway to another. Direct links to pathways acti-
vated during disease states are available from the disease
portals.
The interactive pathway diagrams have been built using
the pathway ontology developed at RGD. This ontology
was created to provide: (a) a means to standardized anno-
tations of genes to pathway terms, including altered
and disease pathways and (b) as a platform to illustrate
the relationships and dependencies between pathways.
Pathway data from multiple sources (KEGG, Reactome,
MetaCyc, GenMAPP) and data as described in the litera-
ture have been incorporated in the ontology and inte-
grated into its hierarchical structure. Pathways of
relevance for a particular Disease Portal are selected for
full curation. Review articles for given pathways are used
to identify the key components and annotate the respec-
tive genes.
DISEASE PORTALS
To facilitate and guide eﬃcient access for researchers
focusing on complex diseases, a number of disease portals
for a variety of classes of disease have been created:
Neurophysiologic, Cardiovascular, Obesity and Metabolic
Syndrome, and Cancer. Most recently released is the
Cancer Disease Portal, which initially focuses on Breast
and Urogenital Cancers. Here, the user is able to view
gene, QTL and strain data for all Breast and/or Urogen-
ital Cancers or reﬁne their selection further to a speciﬁc
disease or class of tumor. The Cancer Portal provides
access to data on phenotypes, biological processes and
pathways, as well as to Strain Report pages detailing rat
strains associated with the disease.
INTEGRATION OF PHYSIOLOGY DATA
The Phenotype and Models portal at RGD, released in
April 2008, was designed to provide an entryway to phy-
siological data and disease model information for
researchers using rat as a model to study physiological
function and human disease (Figure 3). To provide
researchers with the data needed in selection of appropri-
ate rat disease models, the portal includes both phenotype
data for cardiovascular, pulmonary, blood biochemistry,
renal, vascular and general morphological results, as well
as strain availability, disease models and strain details. In
order to integrate physiological data for a wide variety of
inbred rat strains under diﬀerent experimental and envir-
onmental conditions, an ontology-based integration tool
is under development. RGD captures biological informa-
tion for genes, strains and QTL through curation using
ontologies including the Gene Ontology (7), Mammalian
Phenotype ontology (8), a disease ontology and the
Pathway ontology created at RGD (9). Ontology develop-
ment to describe measurement methods, experimental
conditions, clinical measurements and rat strains is
ongoing, initially focusing on cardiovascular phenotypes
(10,11). Researchers can use these multiple ontologies to
explore and ﬁlter the data to address speciﬁc questions; the
system aims to allow the simultaneous querying and
exploration of multiple ontologies to enable researchers
unfamiliar with the data to rapidly focus on areas of inter-
est or expand their view to encompass related experiments.
In addition to providing access to these integrated data-
sets, the portal includes information on animal husbandry,
breeding schemes for developing rat models, detailed phe-
notyping protocols and links to a wide variety of external
physiological resources.
OUTREACH/EDUCATION
RGD has ongoing educational and community activities
promoting the use of the analysis tools and data curated
and stored at RGD. Recent eﬀorts have focused on devel-
oping video tutorials designed to instruct rat researchers in
the tools and data available. The videos and audio narra-
tion walk the user through the dataset, tool or disease
portal, and can be accessed from the Rat Community
page on SciVee (http://www.scivee.tv/node/5812). RGD
continues to host the Rat Community Forum (http://
rgd.mcw.edu/RCF/) as a source for subscribers to ask
and answer questions pertaining to rat research.
DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
RGD has made a continuous eﬀort to provide disease-
oriented data, tools and resources for the rat research
community. This eﬀort will continue as future disease
portals are developed with input from the scientiﬁc com-
munity. The use of biomedical ontologies is growing
Figure 2. New interactive pathways available at RGD include the
transforming growth factor-beta superfamily mediated pathway.

within RGD in the curation process for genetic, genomic,
strain, QTL and phenotype data. Tool development will
include an emphasis on integrating data across multiple
strain sequences as new genomes are sequenced and link-
ing biological function to provide a platform for transla-
tional research. These approaches will allow RGD to
continue to build on the existing disease-oriented views
to assist users in identifying comprehensive datasets to
bridge genomics to human health.
