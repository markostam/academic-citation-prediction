Abstract
Prostate cancer biology varies from locally confined tumors
with low risk for relapse to tumors with high risk for
progression even after radical prostatectomy. Currently, there
are no reliable biomarkers to predict tumor relapse and poor
clinical outcome. In this study, we correlated expression
patterns of the androgen receptor (AR) coactivators lysine-
specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) and four and a half
LIM-domain protein 2 (FHL2), AR, Gleason score, Gleason
grade, and p53 expression in clinically organ confined
prostate cancers with relapse after radical prostatectomy.
Our data reveal that high levels of LSD1, nuclear expression of
the FHL2 coactivator, high Gleason score and grade, and very
strong staining of nuclear p53 correlate significantly with
relapse during follow-up. No correlation exists with relapse
and the expression of AR and cytoplasmic expression of FHL2.
To confirm these data, we did quantitative reverse transcrip-
tion-PCR and Western blot analyses in a subset of tumor
specimens. Consistently, both LSD1 mRNA and protein levels
were significantly up-regulated in high-risk tumors. We
previously identified LSD1 and FHL2 as nuclear cofactors
interacting specifically with the AR in prostate cells and
showed that both stimulate androgen-dependent gene tran-
scription. Our present study suggests that LSD1 and nuclear
FHL2 may serve as novel biomarkers predictive for prostate
cancer with aggressive biology and point to a role of LSD1 and
FHL2 in constitutive activation of AR-mediated growth
signals. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(23): 11341-7)
Introduction
Prostate cancer represents the most frequent noncutaneous
malignant disease in men worldwide and the second leading cause
of death from malignant tumors (1, 2). The incidence is strongly
related to age: Although prostate cancer is very rare below the age of
50 years, the incidence increases tof1,150 cases per 100,000males at
the age of 80 years (3). In parallel, there is a significant increase in
overall incidence. In the year 2000, there were 92,000 new cases and it
is estimated that this figurewill increase to 120,000 in the year 2020 (1).
The clinical outcome of prostate cancer is strongly related to its
differentiation and malignancy grade (4). In particular, the Gleason
scoring system makes use of the increasingly disturbed normal
tissue architecture in high-grade carcinomas. However, Gleason
grading is subject to interobserver variability (5) and requires
expert opinion of experienced pathologists and, thus, has not
proved to serve as an accurate predictor of clinical outcome when
applied by different observers and laboratories (6). Although a large
number of tumor suppressors and oncogenes have been identified
and analyzed in prostate cancers, no surrogate markers are
currently available that can be used to predict aggressive biology of
prostate cancer and to adjust the extent and mode of therapy.
Similar to luminal prostate epithelial cells, the vast majority of
prostate carcinomas express strong levels of androgen receptor
(AR) and grow in an androgen-dependent manner. Hence,
androgen ablation via castration and/or administration of small
chemical inhibitors (e.g., luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone
agonists or AR antagonists) is the most common treatment for
advanced prostate cancer. However, after an initial response in
the majority of cases, most tumors will ultimately progress to a
hormone-refractory stage (7). Thus, constitutive activation of
AR-mediated growth and subsequent androgen-independent re-
ceptor activation are important mechanisms involved in tumor
progression. Likely, candidates involved in constitutive and
hormone-independent receptor activation are transcriptional AR
coactivators. Therefore, we aimed to identify such coactivators and
to analyze their role in prostate cancer biology.
Screening for AR-interacting proteins previously identified
lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1; ref. 8) and four and
a half LIM-domain protein 2 (FHL2; refs. 9, 10) as novel AR
coactivators in prostate cancer cells. Initial observations indicated
that LSD1 is strongly expressed in prostate cancers with high
Gleason score. FHL2 expression occurs in a cytoplasmic manner in
normal prostate glands, and the degree of nuclear translocation
increases in less-differentiated cancer cells (10). In this study, we
therefore systematically investigated LSD1 and FHL2 expression
patterns in a cohort of 153 clinically organ confined tumors treated
by radical prostatectomy and asked whether these patterns may
serve as surrogate markers for aggressive biology and enhanced
risk for tumor relapse.
Materials and Methods
Tissue microarrays. Tissue microarrays were prepared from formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of 153 prostate carcinomas
selected from the archival files of the Institute of Pathology, University of
Bonn Medical School. All tumor samples were surgically obtained from
patients who had undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy in two

surgical centers between 1995 and 2002 for clinically organ confined
prostate cancer (preoperative staging VcT2, cN0, cM0). Patients who had
received prior hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy were
excluded from our study. All cases were reevaluated by a panel of
experienced pathologists for histopathologic staging according to the Unio
Internationale Contra Cancrum tumor-node-metastasis system (11),
rescored according to the Gleason scoring system (2), and subsequently
followed-up between 21 and 128 months (median 40.24 months). Three
different tissue cores representing the lowest and highest Gleason grades
within a single tumor were arrayed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks using a manual device (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI ).
Four-micrometer paraffin sections were cut from every tissue microarray
and used for subsequent immunohistochemical analyses within 1 week.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining was done as
described previously (12) using the following antibodies and dilutions:
a-LSD1 (8), 1:250; a-FHL2 (9), 1:250; AR (DAKO, clone AR441, Glostrup,
Denmark), 1:75; and p53 (DAKO, clone DO-7), 1:250. Negative control
reactions replacing the primary specific antibody by nonspecific immuno-
globulin were done in all cases (shown in Supplementary Fig. S1).
Immunostaining results for AR, LSD1, and nuclear and cytoplasmic FHL2
were evaluated considering only the carcinoma cells and using a
semiquantitative scoring system as described (13). Briefly, the number of
positive cells were counted and scaled (0, no positive cells; 1, 1-25% positive
cells; 2, 26-50% positive cells; 3, 51-75% positive cells; and 4, 76-100%
positive cells). These scores were multiplied with an intensity scale (0,
negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, intensive staining). All slides were
reviewed independently by two pathologists.
RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was
extracted from 10-Am sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
specimens by using the ‘‘Recover all’’ total nucleic acid isolation kit (Ambion,
Austin, TX). Recovered RNA concentrations were measured using the
Nanodrop 1000A spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington,
DE). Reverse transcription of the purified total RNA was carried out using the
Omniscript reverse transcription kit with random hexamers for first-strand
cDNA synthesis (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
LSD1 expression was quantitatively measured using the ABI 7900HT
TaqMan instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan reactions
were done in 384-well plates according to the instructions of themanufacturer.
Expression of LSD1 was measured in duplicates and normalized to 18S RNA.
Primers for LSD1 and 18S RNA were labeled with 5¶-FAM as a reporter and
3¶-NFQ-1 as a quencher and purchased from Applied Biosystems.
Analysis of p53 mutation in exons 5 to 9. Tumor tissue for DNA
extraction was marked on H&E-stained slides and microdissected from
10-Am tissue sections. Extraction of genomic DNA from the tumor samples
was done using the DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen) as described (14, 15). The
following primer pairs were used for exon 5: forward 5¶-TGCCGTGTTC-
CAGTTGCTTTATC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-GCAATCAGTGAGGAATCAGAGGC-3¶;
for exon 6: forward 5¶-AGCAGCTGGGGCTGGAGAG-3¶ and reverse 5¶-CCG-
GAGGGCCACTGACAAC-3¶; for exon 7: forward 5¶-CCAAGGCGCACTGG-
CCTCA-3¶ and reverse 5¶-AGCGGCAAGCAGAGGCTGG-3¶; for exons 8/9:
forward 5¶-CTGATTTCCTTACTGCCTC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-CGGCATTTTGAG-
TGTTAGAC-3¶. PCR was done in 50 AL reactions containing template
DNA, 2 Amol/L of each primer, 0.25 units Platinum Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), 5 AL reaction buffer, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
and 200 Amol/L of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate. The PCR products
were purified using polyethylene glycol precipitation. Template DNA
concentrations for the cycle sequencing were estimated by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Bidirectional DNA sequencing of the entire exons, including
the corresponding exon-intron boundaries, was done with the Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems)
using the forward and reverse PCR primers. Cycle sequencing products
were precipitated with 3M sodium acetate and analyzed on an ABI PRISM
310 capillary electrophoresis system (Applied Biosystems). The identity of
the amplicon sequences was confirmed by database search.5
Western blot analyses. Protein lysates were extracted from homoge-
nized specimens in 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.2), 0.1% SDS,
1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 5 mmol/L EDTA, and centrifuged
at 13,000  g for 20 minutes at 4jC. Ten-microgram protein lysates were
denatured in Laemmli buffer (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 90jC for 10
minutes, loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and subjected to electrophoresis
under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Roti-PVDF, Roth) using standard protocols. After
blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBST for 1 hour, the membranes were
incubated for 1 hour with a polyclonal rabbit anti-LSD1 antibody (8),
monoclonal anti-FHL2 antibody (9), polyclonal anti-AR (dilution 1:1,000;
Cell Signalling), washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000; DAKO), and developed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Little Chalfont, England). For
quantitation, all blots were probed with an anti-h-actin antibody (dilution
1:5,000; DAKO) and the images were analyzed using the image processing
and analysis program from the NIH. The h-actin signal was used to correct
for unequal loading. Expression levels are indicated as the signal ratio of
tumor samples compared with the corresponding normal tissue.
Groups and statistical analysis. Patients were allocated into two
groups according to nonrelapse (group 1; n = 112) or relapse (group 2;
n = 41). Relapse was defined as development of metastasis, histologically
verified local recurrence, and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse
after primary treatment. PSA relapse was defined as a serum level above
0.2 ng/mL PSA confirmed by increasing PSA consecutively. Statistical
analysis was done with the Mann-Whitney U test by using the SPSS 12.0
program (SPSS, Inc., Zu¨rich, Switzerland) and by calculating the Spearman
rank correlation coefficient (two-tailed). Informed consent was obtained
from each patient and the study was approved by the University Ethical
Committee (126/05). Cumulative relapse-free survival was presented as a
Kaplan-Meier plot with m2 statistics.
Results and Discussion
For this study, we retrospectively analyzed expression patterns
of the AR cofactors LSD1 and FHL2 within a prostate cancer
collective from 153 patients. All patients were diagnosed by
histologic analysis of biopsies and staged preclinically with organ-
confined prostate cancer. Tissue processing of all specimens was
done in our institution using identical procedures. Gleason score
was determined independently by two pathologists and cases with
discordant scores were revised by a panel review.
Patient data are summarized in Table 1. Follow-up was
uneventful with respect to prostate cancer in 112 patients (group
1 = 73.2%) but 41 further patients were diagnosed with relapse
within the follow-up observation period (group 2 = 26.8%). When
further subgrouped according to Gleason score, relapses were

significantly higher in the group of tumors with Gleason scores 8 to
10 than in patients with Gleason scores 2 to 7 (P < 0.037).
Postoperative histologic analysis revealed tumor growth beyond
the organ capsule (pT3 or pT4) in 61 cases (40.0%) and clinically
occult lymph node metastases (pN1) in 10 cases (6.6%). There were
slightly more understaged and metastasized carcinomas in the
group of tumors with high Gleason score; however, this was not
statistically significant (Table 1).
To assess differences in expression patterns of AR cofactors, we
immunostained tissue microarrays for LSD1, FHL2, and AR.

Expression of p53 and Gleason score and grade were also analyzed
to verify whether previously established variables for poor prognosis
would discriminate the two groups. Nuclear LSD1, FHL2, or AR and
cytoplasmic FHL2 signals were evaluated using a semiquantitative
score (13). Results summarized in Table 2 show that intense nuclear
LSD1 (P < 0.001), nuclear FHL2 (P < 0.02), p53 (P < 0.05), Gleason
score (P < 0.001), and Gleason grade (P < 0.001) discriminated group
1 patients (no relapse) from group 2 patients (relapse). In contrast,
no significant differences were observed between the two groups
concerning nuclear AR and cytoplasmic FHL2 staining.
More detailed histologic inspection revealed moderate nuclear
LSD1 expression in luminal cells of normal prostate glands and
negative or very weak staining in basal glandular and stromal cells
(see Fig. 1, arrows). Consistent with our recent study, significantly
stronger staining was observed in carcinomas varying from 30% to
100% of all cancer cell nuclei. LSD1 immunoscores also correlated
with Gleason scores as significantly more positive cancer cell nuclei
andmore intense stainingweremeasured in carcinomaswithGleason
scores 8 to 10 (P < 0.001). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient
between LSD1 staining and all Gleason scores was 0.441. Typical
staining patterns from normal prostate and tumors from groups 1
and 2 patients with low and high Gleason scores are shown in Fig. 1.
FHL2 staining was evaluated separately for cytoplasmic and
nuclear staining. Previous studies identified FHL2 as a signal

transducer shuttling from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in
response to activation of the small GTPase RhoA (10). Therefore,
nuclear FHL2 indicates activation of the signaling pathway and
the nuclear coregulatory activity. Consistent with our previous
description, strong cytoplasmic FHL2 signals were present in basal
cells of normal prostate glands but not in luminal cells (Fig. 1).
As basal cells are abundantly present in normal prostate glands
but absent in carcinoma glands, the overall expression level of
cytoplasmic FHL2 was not up-regulated in carcinomas. However,
carcinomas with high Gleason scores revealed significantly more
nuclear staining in f50% of the carcinoma cells than carcinomas
with low Gleason scores. We previously verified, by cellular
subfractionating and Western blotting, that the nuclear staining
pattern of our FHL2 antibody indeed recognizes nuclear FHL
translocated in response to RhoA activation (10).
Interestingly, AR staining did not differ significantly between
groups 1 and 2 patients although there was a trend (P < 0.058)
toward more intense staining in tumors of group 2 patients.
Staining was observed in the nuclei of normal luminal cells and
tended to be more intense in cancer cells. However, even in the
carcinoma cells, proper staining intensity varied from very faint to
intense patterns in 100% of the nuclei. Previous studies addressing
the significance of AR staining as a predictive marker revealed
controversial results (16, 17). Our data further suggest that AR
immunostaining will not become a helpful biomarker to predict
prostate cancer biology.
As immunhistochemical staining of LSD1 yielded semiquantita-
tive results with some overlap between the two groups, we aimed
to validate these data by correlating LSD1 levels with the respec-
tive time—from surgery to relapse of each case and by quantitat-
ing LSD1 mRNA expression levels using reverse transcription-
PCR (RT-PCR) analyses. Results of a Kaplan-Meier analysis shown
in Fig. 2A indicated that tumors with LSD1 staining scores
z8 significantly relapsed earlier and more frequently than tumors
with staining scores <8. Statistical significance according to log-
rank (Mantel-Cox) analysis was P < 0.002. Also, two-tailed Spearman
rank correlation analysis indicated that high LSD1 immunoscores
correlated with shorter disease-free survival within the relapse
group (correlation coefficient, 0.517). In addition, measuring
LSD1 mRNA expression by TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR yielded
results very consistent with the immunohistochemical staining
patterns (Fig. 2B). For these assays, we extracted total RNA from
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens with >50%
carcinoma cells and did TaqMan RT-PCRs using 18S RNA as an
internal standard. The performance of the RT-PCR profile indicated
that the quality of 126 RNA extracts (91 from group 1 and 35 from
group 2) was suitable for PCR analysis. LSD1 expression was
significantly higher in group 2 tumors than in group 1 tumors (P <
0.028), although there was considerable overlap between the two
groups. The difference in RNA expression between groups 1 and 2
tumors was smaller than the difference in protein expression
measured by immunohistochemical staining, most likely because
RNA extracts from tumors always contained some portion of RNA
from normal cells, such as stromal fibroblasts and lymphocytes,
whereas immunostaining allowed to evaluate exclusively carcinoma
cells.
In addition, we analyzed a small subset of groups 1 and 2 tumors
by Western blots. Protein lysates of snap-frozen matched normal
and carcinoma tissue samples with a tumor cell content of >50%
were blotted and probed with LSD1, FHL2, AR, and for an internal
standard with h-actin antisera. Results shown in Fig. 3 clearly
indicated that LSD1 protein was more strongly expressed in all four

tumor extracts from group 2 patients (relapse). The ratio of LSD1
signals obtained from tumor and normal tissue was increased
between 2.0- and 3.8-fold (Fig. 3, cases 5-8). In contrast, the ratio of
normalized LSD1 signals from tumor and normal tissue of group 1
patients (no relapse) was only between 0.7 and 1.7 (Fig. 3,
cases 1-4). Expression levels of total cellular FLH2 and of AR did
not differ between the two tumor groups (Supplementary Fig. S2).
As indicated above, total cellular FHL2 levels do not reflect Rho-
activated FHL2 translocated into the nucleus, and therefore we did
not expect to observe differences on Western blots.
Finally, we also tested whether p53 immunostaining differed
between the two groups of patients. Sixteen carcinomas revealed
strong nuclear staining in f50% of the tumor cells. To control
whether intense nuclear immunosignals resulted from pathogenic
mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53, we microdissected
carcinoma cells from positive and negative cases and sequenced
exons 5 to 9. As shown exemplarily in Fig. 4, all three p53-positive
cases revealed pathogenic mutations known to disable DNA binding
in contrast to three different p53-negative control cases that
revealed wild-type sequences. Subgroup analysis revealed that p53-
immunopositive carcinomas were significantly more frequently
detected in group 2 patients (P < 0.05).
In summary, our data indicate that group 2 patients (relapse)
had carcinomas with significantly stronger nuclear LSD1, FHL2,
and p53 immunoscores and with significantly higher Gleason score
and Gleason grade. Also, tumors with high LSD1 protein and
mRNA expression relapsed significantly earlier and more frequently
than tumors with low LSD1 expression scores. Previous studies
identified both LSD1 and nuclear FHL2 as transcriptional cofactors
of AR-dependent gene activation (8, 10). Most prostate carcinomas
grow in a hormone-dependent manner; therefore, overexpression
of nuclear AR cofactors provide growth signals to prostate
carcinoma cells. Interestingly, a recent study showed that global
histone modification patterns predict risk of prostate cancer
recurrence (18). We were able to show that LSD1 relieves repressive
histone marks by demethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and
thereby leads to derepression of AR (8). Taken together, these
previous data and our present correlative study strongly suggest
that LSD1 might be involved in epigenetic deregulation of prostate
cancer and suggest a pathophysiologic link between histone

demethylation, constitutive activation of androgen-dependent gene
expression, and growth stimulation of prostate carcinomas.
Our data also strongly suggest that LSD1 might be an attractive
novel therapeutic target for treatment of systemic prostate cancer.
Notably, histone demethylation by LSD1 occurs through its
monoamine oxidase activity, which is effectively inhibited by
monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as pargyline. Indeed, we were
able to previously show that pargyline treatment of the prostate
cancer cell line LNCAP conferred dose-dependent growth inhibi-
tion. Therefore, epigenetic deregulation of gene expression
resulting from overexpression of histone demethylases seems to
be critically involved in prostate cancer progression and may
provide a novel therapeutic target.
We also previously identified FHL2 as an AR transcriptional
coactivator, which contains a strong, autonomous transactivation
function and binds specifically to the AR in vitro and in vivo
(10). Interestingly, we and others showed that FHL2 also binds
to integrins and is found in focal adhesions in cultured cells
(10, 19, 20). Nuclear translocation of FHL2 occurs in response to
activation of the small GTPase RhoA by extracellular stimuli, such
as the bioactive lipids lysophosphatidic acid or sphingosine-1-
phosphate. Interestingly, prostate tumors overexpress Rho GTPases
and display altered cellular localization of FHL2 concomitant with
tumor dedifferentiation of prostate cancers and the amount of
nuclear FHL2 correlated strongly with the Gleason grade (10).
Taken together, we showed that stimulation of the Rho signaling
pathway induces translocation of the coactivator FHL2 to the
nucleus and transcriptional activation of FHL2- and AR-dependent
reporter genes. Our present data indicate that activation of nuclear
FHL2 signaling is linked to an aggressive biology and recurrence of
prostate cancer.
A recent study comparing FHL2 mRNA expression in prostate
cancer and normal prostate reported decreased expression levels of
FHL2 mRNA in cancer tissue specimens (21). However, our
immunohistochemical data indicates, in agreement with our
previous analysis of FHL2 expression (10), that very high levels of
cytoplasmic FHL2 expression occur in basal cells of normal
prostate glands. Because carcinomas represent the AR-positive
differentiated luminal cell phenotype and are typically completely
devoid of basal cell–like features, it is not unexpected that analysis
of unfractionated carcinoma tissues falsely suggests down-regula-
tion of FHL2. We therefore chose to study, in this and our previous
study (10), nuclear translocation in carcinoma cells as a variable of
Rho-activated FHL2 protein.
Importantly, immunostaining of both LSD1 and FHL2 provides
novel biomarkers that can be assessed in parallel to p53
expression in preoperative biopsies of practically every prostate
cancer. In contrast, Gleason scoring and grading are subject to
considerable interobserver and interlaboratory variation. Given
the huge effect of preoperative prostate biopsies for clinical
management of prostate cancer, it is clear that additional
biomarkers for accurate tumor evaluation and prediction are
urgently needed and may be useful for preoperative decisions.
With respect to the consistency and robustness of LSD1 and FHL2
immunoreactions, which are easily applicable to formalin-fixed
small biopsies, we propose that these markers, together with p53,
should be further studied as markers for prostate cancer with
aggressive biology.
