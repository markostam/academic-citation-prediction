Abstract. We compared the variability of coronal hole (CH) areas (determined
from daily GOES/SXI images) with solar wind (daily ACE data) and geomagnetic
parameters for the time span January 25, 2005 until September 11, 2005 (late declin-
ing phase of solar cycle 23). Applying wavelet spectral analysis, a clear 9-day period
is found in the CH time series. The GOES/SXI image sequence suggests that this
periodic variation is caused by a mutual triangular distribution of CHs ∼120◦ apart
in longitude. From solar wind parameters a 9-day periodicity was obtained as well,
simultaneously with the 9-day period in the CH area time series. These findings
provide strong evidence that the 9-day period in solar wind parameters, showing
up as higher harmonic of the solar rotation frequency, is caused by the “periodic”
longitudinal distribution of CHs on the Sun recurring for several solar rotations.
The shape of the wavelet spectrum from the Dst index matches only weakly with
that from the CH areas and is more similar to the wavelet spectrum of the solar
wind magnetic field magnitude. The distinct 9-day period does not show up in the
sunspot group areas which gives further evidence that the solar wind modulation is
strongly related to CH areas but not to active region complexes. The wavelet power
spectra for the whole ACE data range (∼1998–2006) suggest that the 9-day period is
not a singular phenomenon occurring only during a specific time range close to solar
minimum but is occasionally also present during the maximum and decay phase of
solar cycle 23. The main periods correspond to the solar rotation (27d) as well as to
the second (13.5d) and third (9d) harmonic.

1. Introduction
Observations of recurrent geomagnetic disturbances with a period of
∼27 days, i.e. corresponding to one solar rotation (so-called Bartels
rotation), brought Bartels, (1940) to postulate the existence of M-
regions on the Sun as the source of these disturbances. Nowadays these

regions are well identified as coronal holes (CHs), characterized by a
low density and open magnetic field lines that allow the solar wind
as well as energetic particles easily to escape to interplanetary space
(e.g. Krieger et al., 1973; Leer et al., 1982; Crooker and Cliver, 1994;
Fisk, 2005, and references therein). Before the solar minimum, CHs are
typically situated at the polar caps with some tongue-like extensions
into the equatorial regions which gives the Sun the appearance of a
tilted dipole (Schwenn et al., 2005). The activity belt that is left at
the equatorial region is seen as a warped separatrix between positive
and negative magnetic field lines that open into interplanetary space
carrying an electric current, i.e. the heliospheric current sheet, HCS
(“ballerina model” by Alfven, 1977). Approaching solar minimum, the
HCS loses its warps and becomes flat in close alignment with the solar
equatorial plane (Hoeksema, Wilcox, and Scherrer, 1982; Hoeksema,
1995).
Originating from CHs, it is predominantly the high-speed compo-
nent of the solar wind (high-speed streams, HSSs) which can cause
recurrent geomagnetic storms if reaching the Earth with a southward
deflection of the interplanetary magnetic field (Tsurutani and Gonzalez,
1987; Crooker and Cliver, 1994; Tsurutani et al., 2004). Corotating
interaction regions (CIRs; i.e. stable patterns of regions where the slow
and fast solar wind interact) in front of HSSs are as well known to
substantially contribute to geomagnetic activity due to the pressure
pulse from the compressed plasma (Schwenn 1983; Crooker and Cliver,
1994; Tsurutani et al., 2004; Schwenn et al., 2005). The major source of
large geomagnetic storms (Dst ≤ −100 nT) are interplanetary coronal
mass ejections (ICMEs) which are earth-directed (Gosling et al., 1991;
Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1997; Cliver and Ling, 2001; Zhang et al.,
2003; Alves et al., 2006). It is reasonable to say that the above men-
tioned drivers of space weather are closely linked to the structure of the
solar corona, hence the interrelation between active regions and large
coronal holes at low latitudes.
The most outstanding period found in solar wind and geomagnetic
activity parameters is ∼27 days1, i.e. corresponding to one solar rota-
tion. This is not surprising as the solar corona shows a less pronounced
differential rotation than the photosphere and a near rigid rotation
during minimum activity (e.g. Hoeksema and Scherrer, 1987; Nash
et al., 1988; Wang and Sheeley, 1993; Altrock, 2003). Also smaller
periods of 13.5 as well as 9 and 7 days are reported (Svalgaard and
Wilcox, 1975; Bobova and Stepanian, 1994; Mursula and Zieger, 1996;
Neugebauer et al., 2000; Nayar et al., 2001). The 13.5-day period was

found predominantly during solar minimum, and was therefore assumed
to be related to the flat and tilted HCS at this time, which causes an ob-
server at Earth to encounter two high-speed solar wind streams during
one solar rotation (Mursula and Zieger, 1996). Bobova and Stepanian,
(1994) studied geomagnetic data together with solar activity data and
suggested that the 13.5-day period is due to variations in the solar
chromosphere, like complexes of active regions separated by 180◦ in
longitude (Gaizauskas et al., 1983). However, distinct periodicities of
13.5 days for solar chromospheric variables were found during other
phases of the solar cycle as well, thus there might be no causal connec-
tion (Mursula and Zieger, 1996). The periodicities of ∼7 and 9 days
were associated to the evolution of the warping of the HCS (Nayar
et al., 2001).
Vrsˇnak, Temmer, and Veronig, (2006) found for a restricted period of
low CME activity during the year 2005, a distinct 9-day period for solar
wind parameters and areas of coronal holes. From GOES/SXI images a
triangular distribution of three CHs (∼120◦ apart in longitude) which
was stable over several solar rotations was obvious. A stable pattern of
CHs might explain in a straightforward manner the obtained periodic-
ities. In the following, we will study common periods in the range 2–40
days for solar wind and geomagnetic activity parameters, and compare
them to the variation of coronal hole areas on the Sun as extracted
from GOES/SXI images. Outstanding periods observed for the same
time range in CHs and solar wind parameters would enable us to draw
direct conclusions on the driver of solar wind variations, namely the
occurrence of large CHs. This aim will be achieved by means of wavelet
power spectra which allow us to detect non-stationary periods in the
data series and to study their evolution in time.
2. Data description
Coronal holes are regions of very low density (due to the escape of the
solar wind along open field lines) which makes them to appear as dark
features in X-ray images (and EUV). Since December 2004, the Solar
X-Ray Imager (SXI) on board the GOES-12 satellite provides regular
observations of the X-ray corona in the wavelength range 6–60 A˚. As
a special data product, coronal hole images are created by stacking
12 hours of solar rotation corrected and calibrated X-ray images which
substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to individ-
ual images (see Hill et al., 2005). From these level-2 files, we chose a
data set where continuously daily observations were available. This was
the case from January 1, 2005 until September 11, 2005, i.e. day of year

(DOY) 1–254. This is a time range of low and “simple” solar activity,
close to the end of the current cycle no. 23, which is advantageous for
our purpose.
We used one SXI level-2 image per day (centered at ∼13 UT) to
extract the fractional area of coronal holes that covered the central
meridian slice in the longitude range [−10◦, 10◦] (see Fig. 1, top panel).
For the determination of the CH areas, we applied a fixed threshold to
the calibrated SXI coronal hole images of 0.15 DN s−1. All pixels below
that threshold (identified as coronal hole pixels) within a specified
region of the visible solar disk were summed up and divided by the
total number of pixels of the considered region in order to calculate the
fractional area covered by CHs. For a more detailed description on the
extraction method of the SXI observations see Vrsˇnak, Temmer, and
Veronig, (2006).
Measurements of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field
parameters were taken from the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Al-
pha Monitor (SWEPAM; McComas et al., 1998) and the magnetometer
instrument (MAG; Smith et al., 1998) on board the Advanced Com-
position Explorer (ACE; Stone et al., 1998). For the analyses we used
the daily averages (level 2 data) of the following values: proton density
n [cm−3], radial component of proton temperature T [K], proton speed
(solar wind (bulk) speed) |v| [km s−1], and the magnetic field magnitude
|B| [nT]. The SWEPAM and MAG data were linearly interpolated for
days with bad or missing data (total missing data <5%).
As an indicator of the geomagnetic activity we used preliminary
daily averages of the disturbance storm time (Dst) index (Sugiura
and Wilson, 1964) provided by the WDC-2 Kyoto Dst index service.
The Dst index is derived from hourly scalings of horizontal magnetic
variations (H-component) measured by a network of ground-based low-
latitude geomagnetic observatories. The magnitude of the Dst index is
proportional to the kinetic energy of ring current particles in the Earth
magnetosphere, and large negative perturbations are indicative of ge-
omagnetic storms (Sugiura and Chapman, 1960; Sugiura and Wilson,
1964; Gonzalez et al., 1994).
As a cross-check regarding possible photospheric causes on the peri-
odic solar wind patterns as suggested in Bobova and Stepanian, (1994),
we study daily areas of sunspot groups that are observed within ±10◦
central meridian distance. The data are taken from the US Air Force
and US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USAF/NOAA)
who regularly compile sunspot observations from different observato-
ries. We note that this is only a rough check since we did not directly
calculate the sunspot area within the considered [−10◦,10◦] central

3. Method
Wavelet power spectra (WPS) are an appropriate tool for investigat-
ing time series that contain non-stationary power at many different
frequencies (Daubechies, 1990). In particular, they can be used to de-
termine predominant periods in a time series together with their times
of appearance. We use the Morlet wavelet (Grossman and Morlet, 1984)
as analyzing wavelet function ψ(τ), where τ is a non-dimensional time
parameter. The continuous wavelet transform can be written as
Wn(s) =
N−1∑
k=0
xˆkψˆ
∗(sωk)e
iωknδt , (1)
with δt the equal spacing in time, N the number of data points in the
time series {xn}, xˆk the discrete Fourier transform of xn and ψˆ
∗(sωk)
the scaled and translated version of ψ(τ) (∗ indicates the complex
conjugate). The angular frequency ωk is defined as
ωk =
{
2pik
Nδt
: k ≤ N
2
− 2pik
Nδt
: k > N
2
.
(2)
With the actual choice for the value of ω, one can specify either
a high resolution in time or a high resolution in frequency. We have
chosen the value ω = 12 as a moderate value showing reasonable reso-
lution in both, frequency and time. All wavelet power spectra (WPS)
presented in Sect. 4.1 were calculated for the time range January 1,
2005–September 11, 2005 and for periods in the range 2–40 days. For
the WPS in Sect. 4.2, the periods from 2–40 days are calculated for the
entire time span of ACE data, i.e. ∼1998–2006. As significance tests,
confidence levels at 80%, and 95% are calculated using a red noise
background spectrum. Regions where edge effects become important,
due to the finite-length of the time series, are labeled as cone of influence
(COI). We further present the global wavelet spectrum (GWS) which
is the time-averaged wavelet spectrum over a certain period (given in
arbitrary units). The computation of all these parameters is performed
in the way described by Torrence and Compo, (1998).

4. Results
4.1. The time period 2005
In Fig. 1 (bottom panel) daily values of fractional coronal hole areas for
the analyzed time range are plotted. Within the period DOY 20–130
several distinct peaks are obtained which appear periodically. Calcu-
lating the WPS from this data set, a significant (95%) periodicity of
9 days is obtained for the time range DOY 20–140 (see Fig. 2). The
GWS in Fig. 2 reveals four peaks above the 95% significance level,
namely at periods of 9-, 13.5-, 31.5-, and 7-days (ordered from the
highest to the lowest power). Note that the peak at 9 days is by far
the strongest one. During this time range, the SXI images clearly show
a triangular distribution of large CHs, consisting of low-latitude CHs
not connected to polar regions, as well as polar CHs (cf. animation of
Fig. 1). This configuration of large CHs, mutually separated from each
other by ∼120◦ in longitude, is stable and recurs from DOY 20 until
120 (cf. animated Fig. 2). In addition, a period of 7 days shows up in
the WPS at about DOY 100–130, which can be identified in the SXI
images as newly upcoming small scale CHs in addition to the stable
triangular pattern of large CHs. In the time range DOY 190–240, a
distinct (significance level of 95%) period of 13.5 days is obvious from
the WPS which was generated by two CHs situated roughly 180◦ apart
– one of the CHs was extending from polar to equatorial regions, and
another one was an isolated low-latitude CH. During DOY 150–210,

the WPS shows enhanced power in the period range of 32 days which
is probably due to solar rotation of high-latitude CHs. However, we
note that in the WPS this period is to a large extent covered by the
COI.
Figure 3 presents the WPS and GWS for the solar wind parameters:
velocity, density, temperature, and the magnetic field magnitude (from
top to bottom). The variations of all solar wind parameters studied
seem to be correlated among each other and show similar variations
in time. Enhanced power (> 95% significance) of a 9-day period is ob-
tained during the time span DOY 20/30–130/140, obviously matching
the periodicity in CH areas (cf. Fig. 2). Around DOY 120 the power
evolves towards a 7-day period, similar as obtained for the CH areas.
After a short interception, the 9-day period returns during DOY 160–
250 (partly covered by the COI) which finds no correspondence in the
periodic appearance of CHs. We note that the 9-day period is most
pronounced in the solar wind velocity, density and temperature, and
less significant for the magnetic field variations. However, for each solar
wind parameter, the strongest signal in the GWS is at a period of
9-days.
Figure 4 shows the WPS and GWS for the geomagnetic activity as
quantified by the Dst index. The most eminent peak in the WPS is
in the range of 7 days (DOY 120–150), but also the 9-day period is
revealed with power above the 80% significance level from DOY 170–
240. Further significant periods obtained are of 14.5 and 22 days. A
broad power enhancement covering the periods from 29 to 33 days is
seen from the WPS and GWS. Note that this power enhancement is
partly covered by the COI.

Figure 5 shows the WPS and GWS from daily areas of sunspot
groups with a central meridian distance of ±10◦. As it can be seen,
the highest power is revealed at ∼29 days; an increased power is also
obtained at ∼14 days. There is no significant enhancement of power in
the range of 9 days after DOY 25.
4.2. Periodicities in the complete set (1998–2006) of ACE
data
To compare the variability of solar wind and magnetic field parameters
during different phases of cycle 23, we calculated the WPS and GWS
for the full range of available ACE date, ∼1998–2006, i.e. almost fully
covering solar cycle 23.
As it can be seen from Fig. 6, for the solar wind parameters ve-
locity, density and temperature, the ∼27-day period has the highest
peak in the GWS but we obtain also high global power (above 95%
significance) for the 13.5- and 9-day periods. The 9-day period is most
pronounced when approaching the minimum phase of solar cycle 23
(2005), however, it is also present for the maximum (2000) and the
declining phase (2002–2004). During the maximum and declining phase,
the 9-day period shows up intermittently over no more than two solar
rotations. Only during 2005 it can be tracked over 5–8 solar rotations
(Fig. 6, see also Section 4.1). The solar wind parameters show enhanced
power for the 13.5-day period during the maximum phase around the
year 2000 and even more distinct after 2003. For the magnetic field, the
most significant periods are of 13.5 and 9 days (GWS) which reveal a
very irregular pattern of enhanced power in the WPS over the cycle.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
We inspected and compared the variability of solar, heliospheric, and
geomagnetic parameters in order to follow periodic patterns evolving
from their source located on the Sun until their consequences at the
Earth. We therefore combined statistical results from wavelet power
spectra together with direct solar observations which is essential for
the correct interpretation of the statistical results.
The present study is based on the CH areas extracted from SXI
images in the wavelength range 0.6–6 nm. Here the question arises
to what extend these values are comparable to the CH areas deter-
mined from observations in the He I 1083 nm wavelength. Studies on
forecasting the solar wind speed based on CH areas extracted from
He I 1083 nm spectroheliograms (Kitt Peak) by Robbins, Henney, and
Harvey, (2006) and SXI (same data as used in the present study) by
Vrsˇnak, Temmer, and Veronig, (2006), led to almost the same results.
From this we conclude that the areas extracted from SXI data are
basically in conformity with those from He I observations, although
there are differences in the determination of the CH boundaries (see
e.g. de Toma and Arge, 2005; Shen et al., 2006). For our purpose of a
statistical analysis, this quantitative agreement is sufficient.
As it can be seen from Fig. 7 showing the daily number of CMEs
as well as their average velocities <v> (summed up velocity of daily
observed CMEs divided by their number)2, the time span January 25,
2005 until May 5, 2005, i.e. DOY 25–125, is a period of very low CME
activity (if considering only geoeffective ones, i.e. full halo and partial
halo CMEs). Focusing on this time range, we found that periodic vari-
ations of 9 days originating from a distinct distribution of CHs, are
equally obtained in solar wind parameters. Such a behavior provides
strong evidence that the periodicities in the solar wind parameters,
showing up as higher harmonics of the solar rotation frequency, are
generated by the “periodic” longitudinal distribution of CHs. After
DOY 130 high CME activity starts which may strongly disturb the
“background” solar wind (shocks, density fluctuations, rotating mag-
netic field) and destroy the direct relation between the variations of
CH areas and solar wind parameters.
The inspection of daily areas of sunspot groups that occurred within
the central meridian distance of ±10◦ revealed no distinct 9-day period
for the same time range as observed for CH areas and solar wind param-

eters. Although a rough check, from this we may exclude the association
of distinct periodic variations observed in solar wind parameters with
complexes of activity (“active longitudes”) as suggested by Gaizauskas
et al., (1983).
The periodic variations of CH areas is not replicated equally well for
all solar wind parameters studied. The solar wind speed, temperature
and density reveal the most direct relation to the distribution and sizes
of CHs. The solar wind magnetic field shows a somewhat less distinct
correlation with the variation of CH areas, but still follows the same
pattern of periodicities (see also Vrsˇnak, Temmer, and Veronig, 2006).
The wavelet spectrum calculated for geomagnetic disturbances as quan-
tified by the Dst index matches only weakly the spectral result from CH
areas but is more similar to that of the magnetic field magnitude of the
solar wind (compare the bottom panel of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). This is to
be expected since the geomagnetic activity does not only dependent on
fast solar wind streams emanating from CHs, but relies on other factors,
most importantly on the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field
with respect to the Earth magnetic field (Schwenn 2006). Therefore, the
relation to the structure of the solar corona is less direct for the Dst
index than for the solar wind parameters.
The clear (triangular) distribution of CHs and their stable appear-
ance over several solar rotations which causes the distinct 9-day pe-
riodicity in the solar wind parameters is related to the underlying
large-scale patterns of the coronal magnetic field. As gathered from
magnetic source surface extrapolations (see Wilcox Observatory un-
ms_revision0.tex; 9/01/2007; 9:19; p.13
14 M. TEMMER ET AL.
der http://wso.stanford.edu/synsource.html), a similar pattern
is seen to what we obtained for the triangular distribution of coronal
holes. The observed large-scale distribution of the magnetic field may be
related to downflow regions of “giant convective cells” (Bumba, 1987).
The existence of giant cells was first suggested by Bumba and Howard,
(1965), however their subsequent history was quite controversial (see
also Hathaway et al., 2000). Indications were found for various solar ac-
tivity phenomena during various solar cycles. For example Vrsˇnak et al.,
(1992) found for the microwave low temperature/brightness regions,
during various periods within the years 1979–1982 and 1987–1989,
large-scale patterns that were comparable with observed magnetic field
distributions. Further evidence for a large-scale evolution/distribution
of solar activity and the global magnetic field is given by Chertok,
(2001) studying microwave, soft X-ray and EUV emitting structures
(chains) that seem to coincide with the boundaries of coronal holes.
From the entire ACE data set (∼1998–2006) we found that the
occurrence of 9- and 13.5-day periods is not restricted to the declining
phase of a solar cycle, but can be occasionally also obtained during the
maximum and close to the minimum phase of cycle 23, however, over
much smaller time intervals. Similar results were obtained by Nayar
et al., (2001) who analyzed solar wind and interplanetary magnetic
field data from 1964–2000. These observational findings are partially
in disagreement with the interpretation by Mursula and Zieger, (1996)
who supposed that a sufficiently flat and tilted heliosheet might gen-
erate two solar wind high-speed streams per one solar rotation, which
subsequently produces a 13.5 day period in the solar wind parameters
when the Earth encounters them. In this scenario, the 13.5 day period
would only be expected at the minimum phase of a solar cycle.
Harvey and Recely, (2002) describe an evolutionary process for CHs
observed during solar cycles 22 and 23, in that isolated high-latitude
CHs might be pre-polar CHs which evolve in time to polar CHs (after
5–8 solar rotations). Since polar CHs are stable and rigidly rotating
objects, they may exist for several years. During their decaying phase
they appear as isolated lobes of polar CHs. This evolutionary process
contributes a lot to the time variation of CH areas and configuration,
and is observed to be most outstanding during times of solar maxi-
mum and minimum (Harvey and Recely, 2002). This might explain the
persistence of periodic variations in solar wind parameters over several
solar rotations during the minimum and maximum phase of the solar
cycle. However, in this respect we stress that the solar wind variations,
i.e. its patterns measured at Earth, are dependent on other processes
too, e.g. CME activity, which can not be straightforwardly related to
