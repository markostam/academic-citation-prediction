ABSTRACT
Pathway- or disease-associated genes may particip-
ate in more than one transcriptional co-regulation
network. Such gene groups can be readily obtained
by literature analysis or by high-throughput tech-
niques such as microarrays or protein-interaction
mapping. We developed a strategy that defines regu-
latory networks by in silico promoter analysis, find-
ing potentially co-regulated subgroups withouta priori
knowledge. Pairs of transcription factor binding
sites conserved in orthologous genes (vertically) as
well as in promoter sequences of co-regulated genes
(horizontally) were used as seeds for the develop-
ment of promoter models representing potential
co-regulation. This approach was applied to a
Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY)-
associated gene list, which yielded two models
connecting functionally interacting genes within
MODY-related insulin/glucose signaling pathways.
Additional genes functionally connected to our initial
gene list were identified by database searches with
these promoter models. Thus, data-driven in silico
promoter analysis allowed integrating molecular
mechanisms with biological functions of the cell.
INTRODUCTION
The completion of several whole-genome sequencing projects
has provided extensive lists of genes (DNA), RNAs and pro-
teins of mammalian organisms (1–3). However, it quickly
became evident that the complexity of higher organisms can-
not be explained solely by the number of parts, but mainly
arises from more sophisticated interactions and networks of
the DNAs, RNAs and proteins (4). This triggered a new
focus towards the analysis of gene groups, their products
and their network interactions (e.g. signaling and metabolic
networks), which is now defined as the ultimate goal of
systems biology (5,6).
Part of that effort is the elucidation of transcriptional
co-regulation networks, which can be seen as one of the most
important levels at which network connections emerge
(7,8). Considerable progress has been made in analysis of
yeast regulatory networks from microarray experiments
(9,10). However, those results cannot be generally transferred
to the human system (11). Therefore, mammalian transcrip-
tome analysis, which is a current focus of research (12,13),
requires different strategies suitable for mammalian networks.
A common theme to all analyses aiming at gene or gene
product interactions is the definition of one or several inter-
acting subsets associated by some evidence to a biological
process, disease or condition. Such gene groups often are
not well defined and contain several functionally distinct sub-
groups, which cannot be separated by conventional clustering
methods (14). However, genes within such subgroups contrib-
uting to a particular biological pathway or process may be
transcriptionally coupled to insure coordinated availability
of the proteins. Transcription is primarily regulated by the
binding of transcription factors to their specific binding
sites in the promoter/enhancer of the genes (7). Therefore,
one way to trace co-regulated transcription on the molecular
level is by promoter analysis revealing shared organization
of sets of transcription factor binding sites (referred to as
frameworks hereafter). Such frameworks can be represented
by computational models, which can be used to scan
sequence databases for genes showing a similar promoter
organization (15).
Unfortunately, promoter sequence conservation is not gen-
eral (15) and even conserved sequence regions, called phylo-
genetic footprints (16) are not directly associated with
functional conservation. Each mammalian promoter repres-
ents a mixture of conserved frameworks (associated with dif-
ferent signaling responses of the same promoter) necessary to
ensure correct timing and spatial distribution of expression
during development as well as correct function in the adult

stage. Therefore, separation of individual functions by phylo-
genetic promoter analysis without further information about
the biological context is usually not possible. On the other
hand, horizontally co-regulated promoters (different genes
within one mammalian species) often also share arbitrary
frameworks that cannot be distinguished from those associated
with the observed co-regulation.
We have designed a completely new strategy that combines
phylogenetic analysis (inter-species analysis) with cross-gene
analysis within one species (intra-species analysis) to identify
single process-associated frameworks, overcoming the func-
tional ambiguities of the individual approaches. We demon-
strate on an example of a disease-related gene list that in silico
promoter analysis contributes to bridging the gap between
molecular mechanisms and biological functions of the cell.

Literature analysis software (Step 1): Current data from
literature on subject-related gene expression, gene function
and gene–disease relationship were collected with the
programs LitMiner (GSF, H. Maier, S. Do¨hr, K. Grote,
S. O’Keeffe, T. Werner, M. Hrabe de Angelis and
R. Schneider, in preparation), BiblioSphereTM (Genomatix),
GeneCardsTM (17), and OMIM (18).
The LitMiner is a web-based resource that was developed
by the GSF group. It allows the generation of ranked lists of
genes associated with diseases and tissues from abstracts of
scientific publications, which are available from PubMed1.
Promoter extraction (Step 2): We extracted the promoter
sequences from human, mouse and rat where available using
the ‘Comparative Genomics’ task of the ElDoradoTM database
(Genomatix Suite–ElDoradoTM, release 3.0, Human Genome
NCBI build 34, Mouse Genome MGSCv3, Rat Genome NCBI
build 2). The promoter sequences used in this study are avail-
able as Supplementary Material.
Promoter selection and modeling (Steps 3–4): The DiAlign
(19) task of GEMS Launcher was used for nucleotide sequence
alignments to check overall promoter similarity for each ortho-
logous promoter set. The GEMS Launcher task ‘FrameWorker’
using the available weight matrix library (GEMS Launcher
Version 3.0, matrix library vertebrate section, Matrix Family
Library 4.0 containing 535 matrices in 253 families, Genomatix
software, Munich; http://www.genomatix.de) was applied.
Model optimization (Step 5): The FastM (20) task of GEMS
Launcher was used to optimize models. ModelInspector (21)
(a GEMS launcher task) was used to search databases with
the optimized models. Selectivity was determined against the
Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD, release 76, >4000 pro-
moters) (22) and against the human promoter database
(Genomatix Promoter Database, GPD, Genomatix software,
Munich, release 3.0, >50 000 promoters).
Model extension (Step 6): The FastM task of GEMS Launcher
was used toextendmodelsby manually addingTFBSs (identified
by MatInspector (23) analysis) to existing models.
Database search with final models (Step 7): ModelInspector
database searches in the GPD were carried out with the final
models.
Functional association (Step 8): Additional information
about connections between the genes from the initial list
and candidate genes found by the model search was taken
from BiblioSphereTM analyses (basis for Figure 4).
Default parameters were applied for the initial analyses in
all programs, if not indicated otherwise.
RESULTS
Rational of the strategy
Functional conservation of promoter organization is evident
in two directions: vertically, in promoter sequences from
orthologous genes (inter-species) and horizontally, in pro-
moter sequences of co-regulated genes within one species
(intra-species). Thus, selection of promoter substructures con-
served vertically as well as horizontally should be best cor-
related with particular biological functions.
The only prerequisites for this strategy are a list of genes
associated with the biological or medical question to be
analyzed, and that the underlying biological processes are
evolutionarily conserved. This allows generation of promoter
models based on combined conservation (vertical and hori-
zontal). Ensuring tight association of models with the bio-
logical problem requires further optimization. We propose
to use selectivity for this purpose because biologically mean-
ingful models are expected to show better association with
the problem-correlated gene promoters. This resulted in the
following strategy (Steps 1–8; Figure 1).
Strategy
(1) Problem-oriented gene selection: The first step is the iden-
tification of an Initial Problem-specific List (IPL) of genes
correlated with a disease, a signaling pathway, a metabolic
pathway or any other gene group linked by a biological
function.
(2) Orthologous promoters: Orthologous promoter sets from
three mammalian species (human, mouse and rat where
available) are collected for every gene in the IPL.
(3) 2-TFBS-models: Orthologous promoter sets are analyzed
for frameworks consisting of two elements, resulting in
initial models (each model representing one vertically con-
served framework).
(4) Shared models: Networks have to contain at least three
members. Therefore, models from the orthologous promo-
ter sets of the genes in the IPL are selected for further
analysis if they match at least two additional promoters
of the IPL.
(5) Optimization of model selectivity: The models are refined
solely based on promoters present within the IPL using
the following restrictions: each TFBS is oriented strand-
specific, and distance range variability between the two
TFBSs is minimized. Selectivity (defined in methods) ver-
sus a genome-wide promoter database is used as the sole
optimization criterion.
(6) Extension of models: In this step, models resulting from
Step 5 are extended by at least one additional TFBS
(missed by standard parameters) resulting in models of
more than two elements. Optimization of models proceeds
as in Step 5. At this point, orthologous conservation of the
extended models in the additionally identified genes is no
longer required.
(7) Database search with final models: Next, the complete
match list for the models defined in Step 6 is determined
from a database of all available human promoters. This
provides the basis for extension of the initial gene list.
Hitherto unrelated genes can be linked to the original pro-
blem on the basis of their promoter organization, and sub-
sequent verification of the connection from an independent
source justifies extending the initial list.
(8) Functional associations: The regulatory networks of IPL-
genes defined by matches to shared promoter models are
then superimposed onto the literature-derived biological
process network of all IPL genes to assess concurrence
between these independently derived networks.
Application example. We have applied this strategy to identify
genes and their transcriptional networks important in the
context of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We
were able to identify at least two potential co-regulation net-
works clearly associated with different biological networks
directly connected to insulin/glucose signaling. We also

extended the original gene list by several new candidate genes
for these networks.
Problem-oriented gene selection by automated
literature analysis (Step 1)
Mechanisms of glucose homeostasis are disturbed in the
MODY-syndromes (diabetes mellitus type II) that were used
as model system. We initiated the analysis with an exhaustive
automatic literature search using all available PubMed1
abstracts. LitMiner was used to extract disease-associated
genes. The following queries were used independently:
<MODY>, <Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus>,
<islets of Langerhans>, <beta cell>, <glucose homeostasis
insulin signaling>. The result of each query was a separate
list of genes. All of these were merged to compile the list
shown in Table 1.
Orthologous promoter sets (Step 2)
Promoters were identified and extracted for all the genes in our
list (Table 1). For the majority of genes, promoter sequences
were available from all species (human, mouse and rat) that
were chosen for the interspecies comparison. For seven genes,
promoters were only available in two species (human and
mouse or human and rat) and for four genes, promoters were
available only for human (CACNA1D, CACNA1H, LEPR,
NPY1R).
We obtained 23 sets of orthologous gene promoters from a
total of 62 promoter sequences, some of which consisted only
of two sequences (see Table 1, column 4). Promoter sequences
were extracted from ElDoradoTM.
Functionally conserved frameworks cannot be distinguished
from trivial occurrences caused by sequence identity in case
of high overall sequence similarity (every sequence-associated
feature is necessarily ‘conserved’ when the sequence is ident-
ical). Therefore, we first checked the degree of sequence sim-
ilarity for each orthologous promoter set by sequence
alignment. Overall sequence similarity ranged from 36% to
77% for human versus mouse/rat and from 62% to 95% for
mouse versus rat. Twenty-one sets with an overall sequence
similarity up to 60% (empirical limit) were accepted for fur-
ther analysis. Models of 2-TFBS-frameworks represent the
smallest functional transcriptional units as known from com-
posite elements (24) and transcriptional modules (25). There-
fore, 2-TFBS-frameworks were generated within these
orthologous promoter sets (interspecies comparison). Each
promoter set was subjected to three separate FrameWorker
runs using distances of 5–150 bp between elements. These
models were required to be present in all orthologous pro-
moters of each set. The remaining 15 suitable promoter sets
fulfilling both criteria (up to 60% sequence similarity and
matching all available orthologous promoters, marked by 
in Table 1) yielded 89 different models.
Shared models (Step 4) and optimization of model
selectivity (Step 5)
Five of the 89 models recognized at least two additional gene
promoters in the IPL and were selected for further optimiza-
tion (M1–M5 depicted on top in Figure 2). The different
parameters for matrix similarity, matrix orientation (strand
specificity), model similarity and distance variation between
weight matrices could be adjusted manually for three models

to maximize selectivity against the EPD (Figure 3). We found
that all five 2-TFBS-models contain at least one TFBS asso-
ciated with endocrine tissues, and four of the eight transcrip-
tion factors associated with weight matrices in our models are
described as being expressed in endocrine tissues (V$FKHD,
V$HOXF, V$MAZF, V$NEUR, BiblioSphereTM analysis).
Extension of models (Step 6)
Models containing 3-TFBSs were generally found to be
more selective than 2-TFBS models (26,27). Therefore, we
inspected the orthologous promoter sets for the genes
KCNJ11, ABCC8, GIPR, GCG and GLP1R (models
M1–M5, Table 2) by MatInspectorTM for additional less
well-conserved TFBSs in all three organisms, and within a
distance range limit of 100 bp from one of the two initial
TFBSs. Again as in Step 3, this range was manually adjusted
for individual models. This process resulted in extension of
model M1 and model M5 by a third TFBS leading to models
M1a, M1b (one additional EBOX binding site each) and M5a
(additional SP1 binding site). We noticed that model M1a
and M1b extended the same model in two directions and
then merged them into model M1c (schematic drawing in
Figure 2), which now consists of four TFBSs.
The model selectivity was assessed against the GPD Data-
base. The most selective model (model M5) matched in 484
(1.0%, Table 2) gene promoters and the least specific model
(model M2) matched in 3283 (6.5%, Table 2) gene promoters.
Model M2 exhibited the best recall (33%, Table 2). The recall
of the 3-TFBS-models was lower as compared to models with
2-TFBSs, but showed increased selectivity (Figure 3). The
increase in selectivity of the 3- and 4-TFBS-models based
on the GPD (>50 000 promoters) is clearly evident
(Figure 3), which was essentially paralleled in an analysis
based on EPD (>4000 promoters, data not shown).
Database search with final models (Step 7)
The GPD was searched with all models M1–M5 as well as
models M1a, M1b, M1c and M5a (Table 2). A clear reduction
in the number of matches in the database (3- to 6-fold) can be
seen between the 2-TFBS-models and the extended models,
which is reflected in a corresponding increase in selectivity.

Inspection of the matches of the extended models also allowed
extension of the IPL. We found additional genes already
known to be involved in insulin/glucose signaling that were
not contained in the IPL, as they did not match our LitMiner
queries (PRKAA1, ADRB3, PPARGC1B, CLIC3, RyR2, VIPR).
Functional association (Step 8)
Biological links between the genes of the IPL were identified
from BiblioSphereTM, which is a gene-centered approach
combining literature with sequence analysis (used to compile
the scheme shown in Figure 4). This biological network
revolving around insulin/glucose signaling is overlaid with
gray areas indicating the groups of IPL genes identified by
the two models M1b and M5a, which are extensively linked in
the biological networks (summarized in Figure 4). Briefly, the
ATP-sensitive K+ channels composed of KCNJ11 and ABCC8
(28) (probably extended by KCNJ3 through models 1 and 3)
are involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion (29), and
seem to be co-regulated as indicated by their shared promoter
framework. INSRR is known to form heterodimers with INSR
and IGF1R (30) and is involved in tyrosine-phosphorylation of
the IRS1 product (31), which in turn inhibits insulin secre-
tion (32). The CACNA1H gene encodes the L-type voltage-
dependent calcium channel VDCC, which is linked to other
genes: It may be involved in the actions of two insulin pro-
protein convertases PCSK1, PCSK2 (33). VDCC might also
influence the GIPR and GLP1R receptor genes both of which
enhance insulin secretion (34).
DISCUSSION
We show that promoter modeling can link disease-associated
genes to potential regulatory networks. The most important
result obtained in this study is achieving this by using a gen-
erally applicable strategy based on optimization of selectivity
of promoter models that also identifies regulatory subgroups
when necessary. We were able to identify putative regulatory
networks within the initial gene list, adding another level of
evidence derived from promoter analysis to links known
from the literature. We also identified novel members of the
putative regulatory networks, which were clearly associated
with the biological processes analyzed. Thus, a link between
known biological networks and regulatory networks des-
cribed by molecular promoter organization became evident.
Although such links have been established in previous studies
(27,35), these depended on particular expert knowledge
and/or problem-specific conditions preventing generalization
of the approach.
As shown in Figure 4, literature analysis identified a group
of genes, which are tightly linked in larger functional net-
works. Furthermore, for nine genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11,
PCSK1, PCSK2, INS, INSR, GCG, IGF1R, LEPR) the Biblio-
SphereTM literature co-citation analysis revealed a connection
to one of the transcription factors that are part of the 2-TFBS-
models. However, we used the literature analysis solely to
compile the IPL, and then relied entirely on sequence analysis
to find and improve subgroups of potentially co-regulated
genes as exemplified by shared promoter frameworks. This
allowed us to use a systematic approach, purging the huge list
of possible frameworks to only five. The final extended models
M1a,b,c and M5a preferentially link the promoters of genes
that are also functionally connected, such as binding to each
other (e.g. receptor complexes) or acting in a common path-
way (e.g. insulin processing, Figure 4). This further supports
the idea that promoter organizational models can indeed
provide the link between the genomic sequence and their
biological function.
We found at least six new candidate genes for the insulin/
glucose signaling network by searching the human promoter
database with models M5a and M1c that were not in the
IPL, but clearly associated with insulin/glucose signaling
(PRKAA1, ADRB3, PPARGC1B, CLIC3, RyR2, VIPR). They
were not included into the IPL either because the literature was
not yet available at the time of IPL compilation or they ranked
too low in the initial list (e.g. no explicit link to beta cells).
The PPARGC1B gene (coding for PGC-1beta) for example is
clearly affected in diabetes (36,37). However, this gene is not
solely associated with beta-cells and, for example, may be
involved in diabetes-related events in the liver (38), further
extending the range of the regulatory network. Promoter
analysis added another line of evidence for the relevance
of these newly identified genes, which allows better experi-

Selected models and their matches found in the list (IPL) of 27 genes and in two different databases (EPD and GPD). All gene names are according to HUGO
officially preferred symbols (46). Origin of the model (column 2) denotes the respective set of orthologous gene promoters used for modeling. Promoters of four genes
(ABCC8, ANXA7, GIPR, KCNJ11) match to three different models indicating highly interconnected networks. Models with three TFBSs show higher selectivity than
models with two TFBSs (columns 5, 6 and 7, absolute match numbers, percentage recognized of all sequences in database and selectivity).

networks. This should help to gain a better understanding of
complex biological processes.
Our strategy described here has several advantages over
problem-specific approaches. Compilation of a complete
gene list from literature would require a priori knowledge
of the solution in order to define the correct queries. In our
approach, the initial problem-oriented list of genes does not
need to be complete, and it can be compiled semi-
automatically. When starting with a single gene or even
just a disease name, it is possible to collect a list of genes
definitely related to the topic of interest. This was shown using
the literature tools described here for mammalian systems.
There is also no need to exactly know how the selected
genes are linked. Our strategy successfully analyzed mixed
data sets not restricted to a single transcriptional mechanism,
and identified subsets connected by shared promoter frame-
works (see Figure 4). Mixed data sets usually present an obs-
tacle to pattern analysis and only recently the problem has
been approached successfully in mammalian systems (39).
However, this and other approaches (40,41) focused on indi-
vidual elements rather than complete promoter organization,
which is the focus of this study.
Throughout the analysis, selectivity was evaluated against
databases, which were orders of magnitude larger than our
training set. Selectivity was chosen, as sensitivity and speci-
ficity require knowledge about the true positive and false
negative, both not available for whole-genome promoter data-
bases. Evaluation of results against the background of all
promoters in the human genome is desirable as it excludes
any artificial bias on control sampling, supporting biological
relevance of our findings. Selectivity proved to be a suitable
optimization criterion as demonstrated in Figure 4. The
importance of combinations of TFBSs for biological function
was also well established before (20), and the particular
organization of frameworks has been used successfully to
describe individual functions already (42). Phylogenetic con-
servation of TFBSs was used for promoter analysis as well
(43,44). However, the combination of vertical (inter-species)
and horizontal (intra-species) framework conservation has so
far not been exploited to the extent implemented here.
The key to success was the extension from single gene
analysis (orthologous sets) towards non-orthologous gene
groups providing the basis to separate different gene groups
matching to distinct models. This required to limit the first step
Figure 4. Functional association between the biological networks and promoter model-derived regulatory networks. The gray arc symbolizes the cell membrane.
Dark gray symbols indicate gene products. Membrane receptors are shown inserted into the membrane (with symbolized ligand docking site outside the membrane);
ion channels are shown as bipartite structures crossing the membrane; gray circles indicate intracellular proteins. The functional connections between the genes
from the IPL were derived by BiblioSphereTM analysis and are indicated by gray arrows; ‘?’ indicates putative connections. M1,2,3 above the gene symbols indicates
that models 1, 2 and 3 all match within the promoter of the respective gene. Shaded areas underlying the graphics indicate potential regulatory networks, which are
linked by shared promoter models (regulatory network M1b and regulatory network M5a).

(orthologous promoter analysis) to frameworks of two
elements, which are usually neither selective nor necessarily
linked to a particular function. Larger models of four or
more TFBSs in orthologous promoter sets begin to show
over-fitting (we generally found them recognizing only the
training set), a feature not desirable in this context. Selectivity
and functional association were brought to these models by
the interactive optimization process. Gain in selectivity almost
always causes a loss of recall. Models containing three TFBSs
turned out to represent a good balance between selectivity and
recall in our example, which is required for a successful search
for potential new candidates in a regulatory network.
This strategy currently requires interactive decisions (such
as which models to extend and how). However, such decisions
are reached in a data-driven approach and the selectivity
analysis provides an objective measure of improvement.
Thus, model finding and optimization are principally suitable
for automation, which could be achieved by systematic
parameter range variation. Detailed expert knowledge of the
problem is only required for the functional assessment in Step
8, but will also facilitate compilation of the IPL.
The systematic extraction of promoter structures (frame-
works) from a group of genes related to a wide variety of
questions or fields of interest and linking these frameworks
to biological functions becomes possible by our strategy.
However, as the input gene list may be incomplete, so may
the result. This strategy will probably not identify all the
models or all the functions hidden in the input genes.
Nevertheless, even being aware that the result will only be a
partial analysis of the problem, this strategy can be used for
most problems involving evolutionarily conserved mechan-
isms of gene regulation. Elucidation of regulatory mechanisms
(45) through functional models as demonstrated here, signi-
ficantly contributes to the functional annotation of mammalian
genomes.
