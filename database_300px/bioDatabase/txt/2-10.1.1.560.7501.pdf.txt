Cond. Res. 19(2):260–264. 2005.—To examine the efficacy of a
low-dose, short-duration creatine monohydrate supplement, 40
physically active men were randomly assigned to either a pla-
cebo or creatine supplementation group (6 g of creatine mono-
hydrate per day). Testing occurred before and at the end of 6
days of supplementation. During each testing session, subjects
performed three 15-second Wingate anaerobic power tests. No
significant (p . 0.05) group or time differences were observed in
body mass, peak power, mean power, or total work. In addition,
no significant (p . 0.05) differences were observed in peak pow-
er, mean power, or total work. However, the change in the rate
of fatigue of total work was significantly (p , 0.05) lower in the
creatine supplementation group than in the placebo group, in-
dicating a reduced fatigue rate in subjects supplementing with
creatine compared with the placebo. Although the results of this
study demonstrated reduced fatigue rates in patients during
high-intensity sprint intervals, further research is necessary in
examining the efficacy of low-dose, short-term creatine supple-
mentation.

INTRODUCTION
S cientific studies have consistently demon-strated the efficacy of creatine supplementa-tion for increasing muscular strength andbody mass (1, 2, 8, 10, 13, 14, 18, 23, 26, 29,
30) as well as increasing the synthesis of mus-
cle contractile proteins (29, 31). The majority of these
studies have used a normal dosing regimen for the du-
ration of their investigations. A typical creatine supple-
mentation regimen involves a ‘‘loading phase’’ of 20 g·d21
(0.3 g·kg21) for 5 days to maximize muscle creatine stores,
followed by a maintenance phase of 2 g·d21 (0.03 g·kg21)
(11, 12, 13, 30). However, similar muscle creatine concen-
trations can be achieved without using a loading phase
by ingesting 3 g·d21 for 30 days (12). The only difference
between these 2 dosing schemes is in the length of time
needed to achieve maximal muscle creatine concentra-
tions (30 days vs. 5 days).
Most reports of creatine supplementation have been
quite favorable concerning side effects and potential
health risks (15, 19, 21). Anecdotal reports of gastroin-
testinal discomfort, dehydration, and muscle cramping
have been associated with the loading phase (27). Con-
trolled studies, however, have failed to support this ob-
servation (9, 13, 26, 29). Nevertheless, some athletes may
still avoid a loading phase when beginning a creatine sup-
plementation program. Although this supplementation
regimen does not reduce the long-term effectiveness of
creatine, the ability to provide any ergogenic benefit dur-
ing short-term supplementation is not well understood.
Most studies demonstrating the efficacy of short-term (5–
6 days) creatine supplementation have used a loading
dose (20 g·d21) as their supplement regime (4, 5, 17, 20,
24). There is only one investigation known that has
shown there to be ergogenic benefits of a low-dose crea-
tine supplementation (3). However, in that study, a dos-
ing scheme of 7.7 g·d21 (0.1 g·kg21) dose was used during
28 days of supplementation. Although this was a much
longer supplementation period than typically seen during
short-term studies, it is the first study to show efficacy
with a low-dose, relatively short duration supplement
regimen. The purpose of this study was to examine the
efficacy of a low-dose (6 g·d21), short-duration (6 days)
supplementation regimen on repetitive, high-intensity
anaerobic exercise in active, college-aged men.
METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem
The experimental design was double blind and involved
40 physically active college-aged men. Subjects were ran-
domly assigned to a supplement or a placebo group. The
supplement group consumed 6 g of creatine (0.1 g·kg21),
whereas the control group was given a placebo similar in
appearance and taste. Anaerobic exercise performance
measures were conducted before and immediately follow-
ing 6 days of supplementation. All testing sessions were
conducted at the same time of day.
Subjects
Forty physically active men volunteered as subjects for
this investigation. Following an explanation of all proce-
dures, risks, and benefits, each subject gave his informed
consent to participate in this study. The Institutional Re-
view Board of the college approved the research protocol.
All subjects were free of any musculoskeletal and neuro-
endocrine disorders. In addition, all subjects reported be-
ing free of any anabolic supplements or drugs during the
previous year and refrained from creatine supplementa-
tion for at least 6 weeks before the start of this study.
The subjects also refrained from any additional nutrition-
al supplementation during this study. Dietary intake was
not monitored, and fluid intake was not measured, but
subjects were encouraged to adhere to their normal die-
tary patterns and to consume between 8 and 10 glasses

of water per day. In addition, subjects were asked to re-
frain from the use of caffeine from 24 hours before the
study until the end of the study.
Experimental Design
Subjects reported to the human performance laboratory
on 3 separate occasions. During the first session, subjects
were familiarized with the exercise testing procedure
(three 15-second Wingate anaerobic power tests). The ad-
ditional 2 sessions were the experimental exercise testing
sessions. There was a minimum of 24 hours between the
familiarization session and the first experimental session,
and 6 days separated the 2 experimental testing sessions
(T1 and T2). Following the familiarization session sub-
jects were randomly assigned to either a placebo (P)
group (N 5 20; 21.1 6 2.0 years of age, 178.3 6 6.6 cm,
83.8 6 8.6 kg) or a creatine supplementation (Cr) group
(6 g of creatine monohydrate per day [0.1 g·kg21]; N 5 20;
21.7 6 2.8 years of age, 177.0 6 7.2 cm, 83.2 6 10.6 kg)
for 6 days. A double-blind procedure was used throughout
the study. All testing sessions occurred at the same time
of day.
Performance Measures
To quantify anaerobic power performance, all subjects
performed the Wingate anaerobic power test (Lode Ex-
calibur, Groningen, The Netherlands). After a warm-up
period of 5 minutes pedaling at 60 rpm, interspersed with
4 all-out sprints lasting 5 seconds, the subjects pedaled
for 15 seconds at maximal speed against a constant force.
The subjects then performed an active recovery (i.e., ped-
aling at 60 rpm unloaded) for 1 minute and proceeded to
perform an additional 15-second sprint. This process was
repeated for a third time. A total of three 15-second
sprints were performed. The force setting for each sprint
was 1.1 N·m·kg21. Peak power, mean power, and total
work for each sprint were computed. Peak power was de-
fined as the highest mechanical power output elicited
during each sprint. Mean power was defined as the av-
erage mechanical power during each 15-second sprint.
The rate of fatigue was determined by the decline in total
work over the 3 sprints by calculating the individual lin-
ear slope (b) for each subject through a regression anal-
ysis.
Creatine Supplementation
Following T1, subjects were provided a total of 6 doses (1
for each day) of either creatine monohydrate or placebo.
Both formulations were supplied using the Actijube sys-
tem (Vitalstate US, Inc., Boynton Beach, FL). The Acti-
jube system is a delivery method using a gel matrix con-
sisting of 3 g creatine monohydrate and a combination of
dipotassium phosphate, gelatin, glycerol, high-fructose
corn syrup, modified corn starch, pectin potassium cit-
rate, potassium hydroxide, propylene glycol, sucralose,
and water. The placebo was formulated to deliver on a
per dose basis the same amount of all ingredients except
creatine and was indistinguishable in appearance and
taste from the creatine Actijube. The creatine component
in the placebo was replaced by cellulose powder and
methyl cellulose. During each dosing, subjects consumed
2 Actijubes in a single serving. Compliance during the 6
days of supplementation was 100%.
On T1, subjects were asked to arrive at the laboratory
at least 2 hours postprandial. The initial dose was pro-
vided within 15 minutes of the conclusion of the testing
session and was witnessed by one of the investigators.
The subjects were then instructed to take the next 5 doses
with 240 ml of water on an empty stomach every morning
before breakfast. The subjects were asked to record the
time they took the supplement. There was no dose re-
quired on the morning of T2.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical evaluation of the data was accomplished by a
2-way (group 3 time) analysis of variance (ANOVA). In
the event of a significant F ratio, Tukey post hoc tests
were employed. A 2-way ANOVA was used to analyze the
area under curve, which was calculated by using a stan-
dard trapezoidal technique. In addition, D peak power,
mean power, total work, and rate of fatigue (defined as
mean performance results of each sprint of T1 2 mean
performance results of each sprint of T2) were analyzed
with independent t-tests. Significance for all statistical
analyses was set at p # 0.05. A sample size of 40 subjects
provided more than 85% statistical power at an a level of
0.05 (2-tailed).
RESULTS
During the 6-day study period, no significant changes in
body mass were seen from before to after in either the P
(83.3 6 10.6 kg to 83.3 6 10.5 kg, respectively) or Cr (83.9
6 8.7 kg to 83.9 6 8.9 kg, respectively) group. In addition,
no adverse side effects were reported from subjects in ei-
ther group. The effects of creatine supplementation on
peak power, mean power, and total work for each sprint
can be seen in Table 1. No significant group or time ef-
fects were observed. Area under curve analysis also re-
vealed no significant between-group differences. In addi-
tion, no significant differences between the groups were
seen in D peak power, mean power, and total work (Fig-
ures 1, 2, and 3, respectively). However, the change in the
rate of fatigue of total work was significantly lower (in-
dicated by an elevated D b values) in Cr than in P, indi-
cating a reduced fatigue rate in subjects supplementing
with creatine compared to placebo (see Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
Results of this study demonstrate that short-duration,
low-dose creatine supplementation does not provide the
same benefits (i.e., improved power performance) gener-
ally seen in longer-duration dosing studies. However, re-
sults do indicate that short-duration, low-dose creatine
use may provide a potential benefit in delaying the rate
of fatigue during short-duration interval sprints. Previous
studies that have showed benefits of short-term (5–6
days) creatine supplementation have used similar perfor-
mance protocols (e.g., repetitive or long sprints) as those
used in this present study. But in contrast to this study,
the other researchers used a typical loading phase (20
g·d21) (4, 5, 8, 17, 20, 24). The basic premise behind the
use of a 5- to 6-day loading phase is to maximize muscle
creatine concentrations in a short period of time (12).
Still, other studies using a similar loading-phase dosing
regimen and supplement duration were unable to see any
significant performance improvements (6, 7, 16, 25). This
was likely related to the performance variable evaluated.
In those studies that reported significant performance im-
provements during short-duration creatine supplemen-
tation, repetitive or long sprints were generally used,

whereas studies that failed to see any performance im-
provement typically used a single, short-duration high-
intensity performance test.
One of the physiological roles of creatine is increasing
the rephosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate through
the creatine kinase reaction (22). The benefit of increas-
ing creatine stores is primarily in reducing neuromuscu-
lar fatigue by decreasing reliance on anaerobic glycolysis
and delaying lactate accumulation during high-intensity
exercise. Thus, in studies examining a single short-du-
ration sprint or in power performance (i.e., those in which
fatigue may not be an issue), the physiological benefit of
higher muscle creatine stores would not be realized. How-
ever, in performance measures that require repetitive
high-intensity activity, the ability to rapidly rephosphor-

ylate adenosine diphosphate would likely reduce the rate
of fatigue. The results of this study support the hypoth-
esis that higher muscle creatine concentrations provide
fatigue resistance during repetitive, high-intensity exer-
cise.
An interesting aspect of this study was the finding
that a short-duration, low-dose supplement regimen was
able to elicit similar improvements in fatigue rates to
those that have generally been seen only in studies em-
ploying a loading phase. Only one study has used a sim-
ilar supplement dosage (7.7 g·d21) and reported signifi-
cant performance improvements (3). However, in that
study, a 28-day supplement regimen was used. As such,
it is likely that muscle creatine concentrations in those
subjects were at or near maximal levels. Hultman et al.
(12) showed that a fivefold difference in supplement du-
ration was needed to achieve maximal muscle creatine
concentrations when comparing 3 g·d21 to 20 g·d21. It is
unlikely that a 6 g·d21 supplementation regimen would
require 30 days to achieve similar creatine concentra-
tions. Harris and colleagues (11) have shown that crea-
tine uptake into muscle is greatest during the first 2 days
of loading. However, they used a typical loading dose, and
not the low-dose regimen used in this study. Although no
studies are known that have examined creatine uptake
into skeletal muscle, using a dosing scheme employed in
this study, it is likely that muscle creatine concentrations
would still be elevated using such a dosing regimen. How-
ever, as muscle creatine concentrations were not mea-
sured here, discussion can only be speculative.
The need for maximizing muscle creatine concentra-
tions is also unclear. Previous research has suggested
that creatine supplementation elevates muscle creatine
stores by 20% (11). The majority of muscle creatine up-
take also appears to occur during the initial 2 days of
supplementation, with a lower retention of the adminis-
tered dose during subsequent supplementation days (12).
How creatine retention rates differ in lower-dose admin-
istrations is unknown, but a more important question
might be whether maximal creatine levels need to be
achieved for significant performance effects to occur. Al-
though the results of our study do not address this ques-
tion, they do indicate that elevating muscle creatine con-
centrations (albeit not maximally) leads to performance
enhancement.
An interesting aspect of this study is the delivery sys-
tem used. Unpublished clinical trials indicate that the gel
matrix used in the Actijube formulation may have signif-
icantly greater absorption ability from the intestines
when compared to the basic powder formulation used in
most other creatine supplements (28). If a greater quan-
tity of creatine is absorbed, there is a greater likelihood
of increased retention by skeletal muscle. However, fur-
ther research is warranted concerning creatine absorp-
tion rates in skeletal muscle using the Actijube system.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
Performance benefits (i.e., improved power performance)
that are typically seen with creatine supplementation
were not demonstrated in this study. However, the re-
sults of this study did show that low-dose, short-duration
creatine supplementation reduced fatigue rates in phys-
ically active college-aged men. Although speculative, it is
possible that changes in fatigue rate may be the initial
performance benefit during creatine supplementation
that is seen before strength and power improvements.
The gel matrix delivery system used in this study re-
quires further examination to determine its potential for
quicker absorption than the powder formulation used in
other creatine supplementations.
