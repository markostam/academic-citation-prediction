ABSTRACT
HIV-1 replication can be efficiently inhibited by intra-
cellular expression of an siRNA targeting the viral
RNA. However, HIV-1 escape variants emerged after
prolonged culturing. These RNAi-resistant viruses
contain nucleotide substitutions or deletions in or
near the targeted sequence. We observed an inverse
correlation between the level of resistance and the
stability of the siRNA/target-RNA duplex. However,
two escape variants showed a higher level of resist-
ance than expected based on the duplex stability. We
demonstrate that these mutations induce alternative
folding of the RNA such that the target sequence is
occluded from binding to the siRNA, resulting in
reduced RNAi efficiency. HIV-1 can thus escape
from RNAi-mediated inhibition not only through nuc-
leotide substitutions or deletions in the siRNA target
sequence, but also through mutations that alter the
local RNA secondary structure. The results highlight
the enormous genetic flexibility of HIV-1 and provide
detailed molecular insight into the sequence specifi-
city of RNAi and the impact of target RNA secondary
structure.
INTRODUCTION
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can induce RNA interference
(RNAi) in cells, resulting in sequence-specific degradation of
the homologous single-stranded RNA (1,2). RNAi is an evolu-
tionarily conserved process that may provide the host with a
mechanism directed against transposable elements (3) and
infecting viruses (4–6). The dsRNA trigger is processed by
a ribonuclease (Dicer) into the effector molecules, 22nt
double-stranded RNAs termed short interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) (7,8). One strand of the siRNA duplex is incorpor-
ated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
subsequently binds and cleaves complementary RNA
sequences (9,10). The efficiency of target RNA cleavage is
affected by the stability of the siRNA/target-RNA duplex,
which depends on the sequence complementarity between
the siRNA and its target RNA (11), the nucleotide composition
of the duplex and the precise position of nucleotide mis-
matches (12,13). Moreover, it has been suggested that
RNAi efficiency is affected by the accessibility of the target
RNA, which may be influenced by protein binding (12) and the
formation of RNA secondary structure (14–18).
Introduction of siRNAs into cells has proven to be a power-
ful tool to suppress gene expression. Transfection of synthetic
siRNAs into cells results in transient inhibition of the targeted
gene (19). Long-term gene suppression can be achieved by the
introduction of vectors that stably express short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) that are processed into siRNAs by Dicer (20,21).
RNAi may be a powerful new method for intracellular
immunization against human immunodeficiency virus type
1 (HIV-1). It has been demonstrated in short-term assays
that HIV-1 replication can be inhibited by synthetic siRNAs
targeting either viral RNA sequences or cellular mRNAs
encoding protein cofactors that support HIV-1 replication
(22–27). Recently, we demonstrated long-term inhibition of
HIV-1 replication in human T cells that stably express siRNAs
directed against the viral Nef gene (28). However, viral escape
variants that were no longer inhibited by siRNA-Nef emerged.
The siRNA-Nef target sequence in these RNAi-resistant
viruses was either partially or completely deleted, or modified
by nucleotide substitutions, which demonstrates the exquisite
sequence-specificity of the RNAi mechanism. In this study,
we analyzed the sequence changes in nine escape viruses and
performed experiments to study the resistance mechanism. We
observed a strong correlation between the stability of the
siRNA/target-RNA duplex and the level of RNAi resistance.
In addition, two viruses were found to escape from RNAi
through mutations that induce an alternative secondary struc-
ture of the target RNA. These results demonstrate that occlu-
sion of an siRNA-target sequence by RNA secondary structure
reduces RNAi efficiency. Moreover, our results highlight the
extreme versatility of HIV-1 and its evolutionary capacity to
escape from RNAi-mediated antiviral therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and viruses
SupT1 T-cells transduced with pRetro-SUPER expressing
siRNA-Nef were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml
streptomycin at 37C and 5% CO2. SupT1 cells (2.5 · 105 cells
in 1 ml medium) were infected with wild-type or mutant
HIV-1 LAI (1 ng of CA-p24), and viral replication was
monitored by determining the CA-p24 level in the supernatant
by ELISA.
C33A cervix carcinoma cells were grown as a monolayer in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and minimal essential
medium nonessential amino acids at 37C and 5% CO2. C33A
cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method.
Briefly, cells were grown in 3 ml of culture medium in 10 cm2
wells to 60% confluency. A mix of 5 mg wild-type or mutant
HIV-1 LAI DNA in 110 ml water, 125 ml of 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.1), 250 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4 and 15 ml of 2 M
CaCl2, was incubated at room temperature for 20 min
and added to the culture medium. The culture medium was
changed after 16 h and viruses were harvested 3 days post-
transfection.
DNA constructs
The full-length molecular HIV-1 clone LAI (29) was used to
produce wild-type and mutant viruses. Nucleotide numbers
presented here refer to the position on the genomic HIV-1
RNA transcript, with +1 being the capped G residue. The
mutant proviral DNA sequences were PCR-amplified from
cellular DNA with the 50 Env primer tTA1-AD (+8269 to
+8289) and the 30 U5 primer CN1 (+9253 to +9283). The
PCR fragments were digested with XhoI and BspEI, and
cloned into the plasmid Blue-30LTR (30). The XhoI–BglI
fragments (1709 bp) of these plasmids were cloned into the
wild-type LAI clone, resulting in the full-length mutant clones
R1–R9.
The firefly luciferase expression vector pGL3 control
(Promega) was used to construct the wild-type and mutant
reporter-Nef target plasmids (pGL3-Nef). An approximately
250 bp Nef fragment (+8448 to +8698) was PCR amplified
from the full-length molecular clones with the primers EW1
(50-ACGTCTAGAATTCTGAGACGAGCTGAGCCAGCA-30)
and EW3 (50-GACTCTAGACTGCAGGAGTGAATTAGC-
CCTTCCA-30). The PCR product was digested with XbaI
and cloned into the XbaI site located downstream of the luci-
ferase gene in pGL3 control. The forward orientation of the
insert was checked by sequence analysis.
To construct the m1–m4 mutants, base changes were intro-
duced into pGL3-Nef by mutagenesis PCR (31). Mutagenic (m)
primers EWmut1 (50-ACAGCAGCTACCAATCCTGCTTG-
TGC -30, mismatching nucleotide underlined; m1), EWmut2
(50-CACAAGTAGGAATACAGCAGCTACCAACCTGCT-
TGTGC-30; m2), EWmut3 (50-CACAAGTAGTAATACAG-
CAG-30; m3 and m4), and the general primers EW1 (Primer
1), EW2 (50-TGAGGCCCGGTACCTGAGGTGTGACT-30;
primer 2), and EW3 (Primer 3) were used with the wild-
type pGL3-Nef (m1, m2 and m4) or the R8 pGL3-Nef (m3)
template. Briefly, PCR reactions were performed with primer
M plus primer 3, and with primer 1 plus primer 2. The PCR
products were purified, mixed and PCR amplified with pri-
mers 1 and 3 as described previously (31). The PCR fragments
were digested with XbaI and cloned in the corresponding site
of pGL3 control. All mutations were verified by sequence
analysis.
The pRetro-SUPER-shNef vector, which expresses siRNA-
Nef under control of the H1 RNA polymerase III promoter was
digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the 314 bp expression
cassette was ligated into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pBluescriptII
(KS+) (Stratagene) to produce pBS-siRNA-Nef. Plasmid pRL-
CMV (Promega) expresses renilla luciferase under control of
the CMV promoter.
Luciferase assay
C33A cells were grown in 1 ml culture medium in 2 cm2 wells
to 60% confluence and transfected by the calcium phosphate
method. A 100 ng wild-type or mutant pGL3-Nef was mixed
with 0.5 ng pRL-CMV, 0.5–500 ng pBS-siRNA-Nef and com-
pleted with pBluescriptII to 1 mg of DNA in 15 ml water. The
DNA was mixed with 25 ml of 2· HBS and 10 ml of 0.6 M
CaCl2, incubated at room temperature for 20 min and added to
the culture medium. The culture medium was refreshed after
16 h. After another 24 h, the cells were lysed in 150 ml of
Passive Lysis Buffer (PLB) (Promega) by shaking for 20 min
at room temperature. The cell lysate was centrifuged and 10 ml
of the supernatant was used to measure firefly and renilla
luciferase activities with the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega). The renilla luciferase expression in trans-
fected cells allowed us to correct for variation in transfection
efficiency.
In silico RNA analysis
The stability of the duplex of siRNA-Nef (UGUG-
CUUCUAGCCAGGCAC) and wild-type or mutant Nef target
sequences (+8448 to +8698) was predicted with the Hybrid-
ization Mfold program (32,33) at http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/
applications/mfold. The RNA structure of the wild-type and
mutant target sequences (+8524 to +8579) was predicted with
the RNA Mfold program (32,33). Similar results were
obtained with larger RNA fragments (+8448 to +8698; data
not shown).
RNA structure probing
Wild-type LAI and R8 proviral plasmids were used as
template for PCR amplification with primers EWr1 (50-AATT-
TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTGGGAGCAGCATCTC-
GAG-30; T7 RNA-polymerase promoter underlined) and
EWr2 (50-TGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCC-30). The resulting
PCR product contains a T7 RNA-polymerase promoter up-
stream of the HIV-1 nucleotides (+8474 to +8694). DNA
products were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen).
RNA transcripts were produced by in vitro transcription with
the Megashortscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion), and tran-
scripts were purified on a NucAwayTM spin column (Ambion).
RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry.
Wild-type and R8 RNA (20 pmol) were denatured in 60 ml
water at 85C for 3 min followed by snap cooling on ice. After
addition of 20 ml 4· MO buffer (final concentration: 125 mM
KAc, 2.5 mM MgAc, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) and incubation
for 30 min at 37C, the transcripts were incubated with 5 mM

lead(II) acetate at room temperature. Samples (15 ml) were
taken at 0, 5, 15, 25 min, and cleavage was stopped by adding
3 ml of 1 M EDTA. RNA products were purified over a
NucAwayTM spin column (Ambion). Oligonucleotide EWr2
(50-TGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCC-30; +8675 to +8694) was
50 end labeled with the kinaseMax kit (Ambion) in the
presence of 1 ml of [g-32P]ATP (0.37 MBq/ml, Amersham
Biosciences). Three picomoles of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide
EWr2 was annealed to 3 pmol of the lead(II)-treated RNA by
incubation at 85C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to
60C. The primer was extended at 60C for 1 h using the
Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After adding
20 ml gel-loading buffer II (Ambion), the samples were heated
to 95C and 10 ml was analyzed on a denaturing 6% acryl-
amide gel. A sequence ladder of the wild-type Nef region was
produced with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide EWr2, the
pGL3-Nef plasmid as template and the thermo sequenase
cycle sequencing kit (USB).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
The siRNA-Nef antisense oligonucleotide UGUGCUUCUA-
GCCAGGCAC (Eurogentec) was 50 end labeled with the
kinaseMax kit (Ambion) in the presence of 1 ml of
[g-32P]ATP (0.37 MBq/ml, Amersham Biosciences). Wild-
type and R8 RNA were denatured in 30 ml water at 85C
for 3 min followed by snap cooling on ice. After addition
of 10 ml 4· MO buffer (final concentration: 125 mM KAc,
2.5 mM MgAc, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0), the RNA was rena-
tured at 37C for 30 min. The transcripts were diluted in 1·MO
buffer to a final concentration varying from 0 to 7.5 mM in MO
buffer. The 50-labeled oligonucleotide was added (2.6 nM) and
the samples (20 ml) were incubated for 30 min at room
temperature. After adding 4 ml non-denaturing loading buffer
(50% glycerol with bromophenol blue), the sample was
analyzed on a non-denaturing 4% acrylamide gel. Electrophor-
esis was performed at 150 V at room temperature, and the gel
was subsequently dried. Quantification of the free and bound
oligonucleotide was performed with a Phosphor Imager
(Molecular Dynamics).
RESULTS
Selection of RNAi-resistant HIV-1 variants
We previously demonstrated potent inhibition of HIV-1
replication in the SupT1 T-cell line by stable expression of
an siRNA directed against the viral Nef gene (28). This target
sequence is located near the 30 end of the viral genome
(Figure 1A), and is present in both the unspliced genomic
RNA and all spliced subgenomic RNAs. This replication
block is apparently not absolute as HIV-1 escape variants
appeared after several weeks of culture. We previously repor-
ted the acquisition of either a nucleotide substitution or a
deletion in the Nef target sequence in such escape viruses.
We now selected additional escape variants and analyzed a
total of nine cultures by RT–PCR of the Nef segment and
subsequent sequence analysis (Figure 1B). A single nucleotide
substitution was observed within the 19 nt target sequence in
three escape viruses (R3, R6, R9). The R3 virus had acquired
an additional nucleotide substitution at a later time (sample
R30). This finding suggests that the single R3 mutation did not
provide complete RNAi-resistance. Partial or complete
deletion of the Nef target was observed in five cultures
(R1, R2, R4, R5, R7). These changes obviously affect the
Nef open reading frame, resulting in the synthesis of a Nef
protein with an internal deletion or a truncated protein due to a
frameshift mutation. Since the Nef protein is not essential for
HIV-1 replication in T-cell lines, these mutations will have no
major impact on viral replication in our culture system. Most
surprisingly, the R8 escape virus has no mutation in the
siRNA-Nef target sequence, but does instead have a single
nucleotide substitution 7 nt upstream of the target sequence.
To verify that the observed mutations in or near the target
sequence mediated the RNAi-resistant phenotype, we intro-
duced the mutant Nef sequences in the HIV-1 LAI molecular
clone. SupT1 cells that stably express siRNA-Nef were infec-
ted with wild-type or mutant HIV-1 virus. Wild-type HIV-1 is
potently inhibited by the siRNA-Nef and did not initiate a
spreading infection (Figure 2). In contrast, all mutant viruses
replicate, demonstrating that the observed mutations in the Nef
gene confer resistance against siRNA-Nef. The different
escape variants do seem to replicate with different efficiencies.
For instance, R30 is more fit than the R3 virus, suggesting that
the additional mutation in the target sequence provides a
higher level of resistance against siRNA-Nef. However, we
decided not to focus in more detail on the differences in
replication fitness because it is a complex phenotype made

up of several factors (level of RNAi-resistance, impact of Nef
protein modification, potential removal of RNA replication
signals, etc.).
The siRNA/target-RNA duplex stability influences
the level of RNAi resistance
To accurately quantify the level of RNAi resistance, we made
reporter gene constructs in which the wild-type or mutant
Nef target sequence was placed downstream of the luciferase
reporter gene (Figure 3A, pGL3-Nef). These constructs were
co-transfected with an increasing amount of an siRNA-Nef
expressing plasmid (pBS-siRNA-Nef) into the human cervix
carcinoma cell line C33A, and luciferase production was
measured after 48 h (Figure 3B). Reporter gene expression
of the construct with the wild-type Nef sequence was signi-
ficantly reduced by co-transfection with 0.5 ng pBS-siRNA-
Nef (40% residual expression), and nearly complete inhibition
(10% residual expression) was obtained with higher amounts
of siRNA-Nef. Expression of the reporter gene construct in
which the target sequence was completely deleted (R1) was
not inhibited by siRNA-Nef, demonstrating complete resist-
ance. The constructs with a partial deletion of the target
sequence showed complete (R2, 11 nt deletion) or partial
resistance against siRNA-Nef (R4 and R5, with a deletion
of 5 and 4 nt in the target sequence, respectively). Expression
of the latter constructs was inhibited marginally at low
amounts of pBS-siRNA-Nef, and high siRNA-Nef levels
resulted in partial inhibition (40–60% residual expression).
The constructs with a single nucleotide substitution showed
either partial resistance (R3 and R9) or nearly complete res-
istance (R6). The acquisition of a second mutation in the R3
virus (R30) only marginally increased the level of resistance in
this assay system. The construct with the mutation upstream of
the target sequence (R8) also demonstrates partial resistance
against siRNA-Nef in this assay.
Since RNAi is dependent on the sequence-specific base-
pairing of siRNA to the target RNA sequence, reduced binding
due to mismatches may explain the resistance-phenotype of all
escape variants, except for the R8 variant with a nucleotide
substitution outside the target sequence. We therefore calcu-
lated the predicted thermodynamic stability (DG) of the
siRNA/target-RNA interaction for the wild-type and mutant
targets and plotted this value against the measured level of
resistance (Figure 4). The siRNA-Nef forms a perfectly base-
paired duplex with the wild-type target (DG =26.1 kcal/mol),
consistent with efficient inhibition by siRNA-Nef (18% res-
istance). Both the substitution and deletion mutants show
reduced siRNA/target-RNA duplex stability that correlates
with increased resistance against siRNA-Nef (Figure 4).
However, two escape variants (R6 and R8) do not follow
this general pattern and show an exceptionally high level of
resistance. The nucleotide substitution in R8 is located
Figure 2. Nef mutations provide resistance against siRNA-Nef. The Nef muta-
tions shown in Figure 1B were cloned in the HIV-1 LAI molecular clone. Virus
stocks were produced in transiently transfected C33A cells and used to infect
SupT1 cells stably expressing siRNA-Nef. Virus replication was monitored by
determining the level of CA-p24 in the culture supernatant. Similar results were
obtained in independent infection experiments. The R7 variant was excluded
from further analysis since it contained a complete deletion of the siRNA-Nef
target sequence very similar to the R1 variant. The wild-type LAI virus that
does not replicate on these SupT1-siRNA-Nef cells replicates efficiently on
control SupT1 cells [results not shown, see also (28)].

cells with the siRNA-Nef expressing plasmid pBS-siRNA-Nef. (B) Luciferase expression observed after transfection of the reporter constructs with increasing
amounts of pBS-siRNA-Nef. The level of expression observed in the absence of siRNA-Nef was set at 100% for each reporter construct. This level did not vary
significantly for the different constructs. The mean values obtained in three independent experiments are shown (–SE).

upstream of the target sequence. The siRNA/target-RNA
duplex stability is thus not affected for this mutant, yet it is
fairly resistant against RNAi. The R6 mutant contains an
A-to-G substitution in the target sequence that has only a
minor effect on the siRNA/target-RNA duplex because an
U–A base pair is replaced by an U–G base pair. Whereas this
substitution only marginally affects the stability of the duplex
(DG = 25.7 kcal/mol), the R6 mutant shows nearly com-
plete resistance.
Changes in target RNA structure can cause RNAi
resistance
Binding of siRNA-Nef to its target sequence may also be
affected by the accessibility of the target sequence, and
thus by local RNA structure. Since RNAi resistance of the
R6 and R8 mutants could not be explained by an altered
stability of the siRNA/target-RNA duplex, we examined the
effect of these mutations on the local RNA structure. We first
used the Mfold program (32,33) to predict the secondary
structure of the wild-type, R6 and R8 Nef target RNA. The
energetically most favorable RNA structure of the wild-type
Nef region (Figure 5A; DG = 17.9 kcal/mol) is an extended
hairpin (S hairpin) that partially overlaps with the siRNA
target sequence (marked in gray), but the 30 half of the target
sequence is predicted to be single-stranded. The G-to-A sub-
stitution upstream of the target sequence in R8 destabilizes this
hairpin structure (DG =13.0 kcal/mol), and the RNA is likely
to fold an alternative, more stable conformation with two
smaller hairpins (Figure 5A; DG = 15.0 kcal/mol). In this
alternative conformation, the second hairpin (R hairpin)
encompasses the complete target sequence of which both
the 50 and 30 ends are occluded by base-pairing. This new
hairpin configuration of the target sequence may prevent
the binding of siRNA-Nef.
This scenario is confirmed by inspection of the R6 escape
variant. In fact, the R6 mutation in the target sequence does not
reduce the stability of the wild-type S hairpin, but it
profoundly stabilizes the alternative R hairpin (Figure 5B;
DG = 21.3 kcal/mol). The A-to-G substitution in the target
sequence allows the formation of two additional base pairs in
this hairpin, thereby reducing the loop size from 10 to 6 nt.
Figure 4. RNAi-resistance due to reduced stability of the siRNA/target-RNA
duplex. The thermodynamic stability (DG) of the siRNA-Nef/target-RNA
duplex was calculated with the Hybridization Mfold program and plotted
against the level of resistance as observed in Figure 3B with 5 ng of pBS-
siRNA-Nef. The high level of resistance of the mutants R8 and R6 does not
correlate with their predicted duplex stability.

The G-to-A substitution 7 nt upstream of the target sequence in R8 is encircled.
This mutation disrupts the preferred sensitive (S) hairpin (DG = 17.9 !
DG = 13.0 kcal/mol), resulting in folding of a more stable alternative struc-
ture with the resistant (R) hairpin and a small upstream stem loop (DG =
15.0 kcal/mol). (B) RNA structures of the wild-type and R6 Nef sequences.
The A-to-G substitution at nucleotide 14 of the target sequence in R6 is
indicated. This mutation does not affect the S hairpin, but profoundly stabilizes
the alternative R hairpin through formation of two additional base pairs
(DG = 17.9 ! DG = 21.3 kcal/mol). (C) The thermodynamic stability
(DG) of the RNAi-sensitive (S) and the RNAi-resistant (R) structures are
indicated for the wild-type (wt) and mutant (R6 and R8) Nef sequences. In
wild-type RNA, the S structure (DG = 17.9 kcal/mol) is more stable than the
R structure (DG = 15.1 kcal/mol). In mutant R8, the sensitive structure is
destabilized (S0;DG=13.0 kcal/mol) and energetically less favorable than the
resistant structure (DG = 15.0 kcal/mol). Stabilization of the R hairpin in
mutant R6 makes this conformation (R0; DG =21.3 kcal/mol) more favorable
than the sensitive conformation (S; DG = 17.9 kcal/mol).

Thus, the exceptionally high level of resistance of R6 is
probably due to occlusion of the target sequence in a stable
hairpin structure, although a contribution of the slightly
reduced stability of the siRNA/target-RNA duplex due to
the formation of the G–U base pair cannot be excluded. In
Figure 5C, the stability of the RNAi-sensitive (S) and the
RNAi-resistant (R) conformations for the wild-type (wt),
R6 and R8 RNAs are plotted. The wild-type can fold
both RNA structures, but the S conformation is favored
because it is more stable than the R conformation. The S
conformation is destabilized (S0) in mutant R8, which thus
becomes energetically less favorable than the R conformation.
Stabilization of the R hairpin in mutant R6 makes this alter-
native conformation (R0) more favorable than the wild-type S
structure.
The S and R RNA structure equilibrium dictates the
level of RNAi resistance
We designed additional mutants to confirm that the presence or
absence of the wild-type S hairpin determines RNAi sensi-
tivity. All new mutants affect the 26/7 base pair of the S
hairpin that was opened in the R8 escape variant, and these
nucleotide changes are thus positioned outside the actual Nef
target sequence (Figure 6A). The RNA Mfold program was
used to estimate the thermodynamic stability of the S and R
conformations and RNAi sensitivity was determined in the
luciferase-assay system (Figure 6B). The G-to-C substitution
at position 7 in mutant m1 resembles the R8 mutation
and similarly opens the S hairpin. Like the R8 mutant, this
m1 mutant shows partial resistance against siRNA-Nef
(Figure 6B). However, the m1 mutation also stabilizes
the alternative R conformation (m1: DGR = 19.4 kcal/mol)
by the formation of two additional base pairs in the R
hairpin (7/+5 and 8/+6). This explains the higher level
of resistance of m1 in comparison with R8 in which only
hairpin S is destabilized. This resistant phenotype of m1
is reversed almost completely in the double mutant m2 by
the introduction of a compensatory base change at position
26 (C-to-G), which restores base-pairing and preferential
formation of the S hairpin. However, the m2 mutant is
slightly more resistant than the wild-type. This can be
explained by the relatively higher stability of the R hairpin
in mutant m2 due to the 7 change. The 26 mutation in m2
also affects the stability of the small upstream hairpin of the
R conformation. The DG values plotted in Figure 6A do
include all these effects.
In the double mutant m3, we restored base-pairing in the
original escape variant R8 (which has a G-to-A at position7)
by introducing a compensatory mutation (C-to-U at position
26). Accordingly, this compensation reversed the RNAi-
resistant phenotype of R8. The corresponding single mutant
m4, which contains only the C-to-U mutation at position
26, maintains base-pairing capacity in the S hairpin with
a U–G base pair. Indeed, this mutant remains RNAi sensitive.
The26 mutation in m3 and m4 also affects the stability of the
smaller hairpin in the R conformation, which is included in the
DGR calculations. These combined results strongly suggest
that it is not the identity of the 26/7 base pair per se,
but rather the stabilization of the S hairpin structure that is
critical for RNAi sensitivity.
We calculated the differences in DG of the S and R
conformations (DDG), which reflects the S–R structure
equilibrium, incorporating all mutational effects on the two
conformations (Figure 6A). A negative DDG value indicates
that the RNA preferentially folds the S hairpin structure,
whereas a positive value reflects a preference for the R hairpin
conformation. Preference for the S hairpin correlates with
RNAi sensitivity and mutations that shift the equilibrium
towards the R hairpin conformation result in increased
resistance against siRNA-Nef (Figure 6C).

a measure of the S and R structure equilibrium, was calculated (DDG=

RNA structure probing
To demonstrate that the R8 mutation does indeed affect the local
RNA structure, we performed RNA structure probing experi-
ments on the Nef region using lead(II), which is known to
preferentially cleave single-stranded RNA (Figure 7A). The
cleavage pattern of the wild-type RNA is consistent with the
proposed RNA secondary structure model (Figure 7B, left). For
instance, we observed high reactivity in the loop and single-
stranded regions and low reactivity in the base-paired stem. The
30 end of the siRNA-Nef target sequence in the wild-type RNA
is highly sensitive to lead, indicating that this region is single
stranded. The cleavage pattern of the R8 mutant is different and
confirms the proposed alternative folding (Figure 7B, right). In
contrast to the wild-type RNA, the 30 end of the siRNA-Nef
target sequence is resistant to lead-induced cleavage, indicating
that this region is base-paired as in hairpin R. The R8 RNA
shows increased lead-sensitivity near the center of the target
sequence, which corresponds with the exposed loop of the R
hairpin. Domains further upstream and downstream on the wild-
type and R8 RNA show a very similar lead-cleavage pattern,
indicating that the change in RNA secondary structure occurs
locally. These findings confirm that the R8 mutation results in
alternative RNA folding that affects the presentation of the
target sequence.
Stable target RNA structure blocks siRNA binding
To demonstrate directly that the alternative structure formed
by R8 RNA does occlude the Nef target sequence from binding
to the complementary siRNA-Nef strand, we performed bind-
ing assays. A 19 nt RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the
antisense strand of the siRNA-Nef was radioactively labeled,
incubated at room temperature with increasing amounts of
wild-type and R8 target RNA, and analyzed in an electrophor-
etic mobility shift assay (Figure 8A). Binding of this siRNA-
Nef oligonucleotide to the target RNA results in a profound
shift on a non-denaturing gel. The free siRNA-Nef and the
siRNA-Nef/target-RNA duplex bands were quantitated to cal-
culate the percentage of binding (Figure 8B). The siRNA-Nef
bound less efficiently to R8 RNA than to wild-type RNA.
Whereas almost all siRNA is shifted at high levels of wild-
type RNA, the same amount of R8 RNA is not able to shift
more than 39% of the siRNA-Nef. Because RNA structures
should be temperature sensitive, we also performed assays at
elevated temperatures. Indeed, the binding defect of the R8
mutant was diminished under such conditions (results not
shown). Furthermore, kinetic experiments with an excess of
siRNA-Nef showed that binding to wild-type RNA is signi-
ficantly faster than to R8 RNA (3- to 4-fold difference at room
temperature, results not shown). Since these two RNA
templates do not differ in the actual target sequence, these
results indicate that the alternative structure of R8 does
occlude the target sequence from interacting with siRNA-Nef.
DISCUSSION
HIV-1 replication can be inhibited efficiently through RNAi
by targeting the viral Nef sequence. However, RNAi-resistant
viruses emerged that contained nucleotide substitutions or
deletions in or near the siRNA-Nef target sequence. We
recloned these mutant Nef sequences in the HIV-1 genome
and demonstrate that these mutations do indeed confer resist-
ance against siRNA-Nef. We used a reporter–target gene con-
struct to accurately quantitate the level of resistance. For most
mutants, we observed an inverse correlation between the level
of resistance and the stability of the siRNA/target-RNA
duplex. Two mutants did not follow this trend and demon-
strated an unexpected high level of resistance. We demonstrate
that these mutations induce alternative folding of the RNA that
occludes the target sequence from binding to siRNA-Nef.
These results demonstrate that the efficiency of RNAi-
mediated inhibition depends on the efficiency of siRNA-
binding to the target RNA. This interaction can be diminished
by nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the target sequence
that cause mismatches with the siRNA, or by mutations that
induce an RNA structure in which the target sequence is
occluded.
It has previously been reported that a mismatch between the
target and siRNA can affect RNAi to a variable degree,

times as indicated above the lanes. Sites of lead-induced cleavage were detected
by primer extension on the RNA. The wild-type sequence was analyzed in

sequence is indicated with an arrow. (B) The lead-induced cleavage sites are

depending on the position of the mismatch in the duplex
(13,34). Kinetic analyses suggested that different regions of
the siRNA play distinct roles regarding target recognition,
cleavage and product release (35). The 50 end of the siRNA
contributes to initial target RNA binding, and mutations in
either the central or the 30 region of the target affect RNAi
efficiency most dramatically (13,34). Most nucleotide substi-
tutions that we observed in the RNAi-resistant HIV-1 variants
are located in the center of the Nef target sequence, consistent
with this notion. Mutations in the 50 region of the target RNA
have a milder effect, which may explain the small difference in
resistance of the early R3 and late R30 variants. The partial
deletion mutants R4 and R5 differ significantly in their levels
of resistance against siRNA-Nef (respectively 50% and 75%
with 5 ng of siRNA-Nef-expressing plasmid). Focusing on
the siRNA-Nef target sequence, R4 has a 5 nt deletion at the
50 side and R5 a 4 nt deletion at the 30 side. The fact that R5 is
more resistant than R4 is also consistent with the notion that
mismatches in the 30 region in the target RNA are less well
tolerated by the RNAi machinery.
Several studies have suggested an inhibitory effect of target
RNA structure on RNAi efficiency (14–18). However, these
studies mainly compared the efficiency of different siRNA and
target sequences, such that only correlations with target RNA
structure could be suggested. Furthermore, these studies did
not experimentally verify the proposed RNA structures. We
assayed the efficiency of a single target sequence when present
in a different structural context. We confirmed these alternat-
ive RNA secondary structures in probing experiments. We
demonstrate that occlusion of the target sequence by RNA
structure inhibits binding of the siRNA, and thus reduces
RNAi efficiency. Interestingly, the wild-type RNAi-sensitive
hairpin S occludes only the 50 side of the target sequence,
whereas both the 50 and 30 sides are base-paired in the altern-
ative RNAi-resistant structure. This result indicates that an
accessible 30 target end is sufficient for target recognition,
which is consistent with the idea that this 30 region is mainly
responsible for target recognition and binding (35).
It has previously been suggested that RNA hairpins are poor
targets for RNAi because the corresponding antisense siRNAs
will also have the ability to fold a stem–loop structure, which
may hamper their activity (14). Although the 19 nt siRNA-
Nef can indeed form a hairpin (6 bp stem, 6 nt loop: DG=
5.1 kcal/mol), we know that this siRNA-Nef is very effective
in silencing of the wild-type virus, indicating that this siRNA
structure is not inhibitory.
Gene therapy to impose HIV-1 specific RNAi could become
a realistic approach to potently inhibit virus replication
(36–38). The siRNA directed against the viral Nef gene
demonstrated a potent and sequence-specific antiviral effect.
However, due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1, the virus can
escape from RNAi-mediated inhibition (28,39). The fact that
RNAi-resistant HIV-1 variants can emerge not only through
deletions or substitutions in the siRNA target sequence, but
also through mutations that alter the local RNA structure,
demonstrates the extreme flexibility of the HIV-1 virus.
Some escape viruses have lost the ability to encode a func-
tional Nef protein. Whereas complete inactivation of the
accessory Nef function has a relatively minor impact on the
HIV-1 replication fitness in vitro, it significantly attenuates
replication in vivo (40,41). It is therefore less likely that HIV-1
will acquire resistance in vivo by deletion or frameshifting of
the Nef open reading frame. Nevertheless, the virus may still
evolve resistance by accumulating silent point mutations. It is
therefore important to identify additional targets in highly
conserved sequences in essential HIV-1 genes. There may
be other constraints in the viral genome, e.g. overlapping
open reading frames, which could be used to design potent
siRNAs from which escape is very difficult. Furthermore,
targeting of a sequence located in or near a functionally essen-
tial secondary RNA structure motif could be advantageous.
Escape mutations (even silent codon changes) may disrupt
such replication signals and are thus less likely to emerge.
Additionally, the transcripts of cellular cofactors can be tar-
geted, but the knockdown of such functions should not affect
viability of the host cell. Ideally, HIV-1 should be targeted by
multiple siRNAs against essential HIV-1 sequences (42).
Similar to current antiviral drug combination therapies, this
should prevent the emergence of escape mutants that are
resistant to RNAi-mediated inhibition.
