Abstract 
In this paper, the changes in the annual runoff and sediment transport have been assessed by 
using the long term observation data from 10 gauging stations on 10 large rivers across China 
from far north to far south. It is found that the annual sediment yield has generally had a 
decreasing trend in the past half century. According to the changes in annual runoff and the 
sediment yield per area, rivers in China can be classified into the following three groups: 1) 
rivers with decreasing annual sediment transport and stable runoff; 2) rivers with both decreasing 
annual sediment transport and runoff and 3) rivers with greatly reduced annual sediment 
transport and decreasing annual runoff. The results indicate that, in all southern rivers (to the 
south of the Huaihe River including the Huaihe River), there has been little change in average 
annual runoff but a dramatic decrease in annual sediment transport. In the northern rivers, 
however, both the annual sediment yield and the runoff show significant evidence of reduction.  
To further investigate the recent changes in annual runoff and sediment transport, the short-term 
observation data from these 10 gauging stations in the recent 10 years have been assessed. 
Results show that both the annual sediment transport and the runoff have decreased significantly 
in the northern rivers in the past 10 years. Using the Yellow River at the Lijin Station as an 
example, the average annual runoff for the last 10 years is only 1/3 of the long term average 
value and the average annual sediment yield of the last 10 years is only 1/4 of the long term 
average value. More unusually, in the Yongding River the annual sediment yield has approached 
zero and the runoff has decreased significantly. In addition, the impacts of human activities on 
the changes in both runoff and sediment transport have been discussed.

1 Introduction 
Soil erosion is a worldwide problem that threatens an important and non-renewable resource – farmland. 
Soil erosion involves the detachment and movement of soil particles by both wind and water, but the latter 
is more significant. The soil erosion process can be accelerated by human activity, such as the removal of 
surface vegetation, forest harvesting, rangeland grazing, surface mining and urbanization. Tillage 
implements, forest harvesting equipment, mining activities and construction equipment all disturb the soil 
structure, which can also reduce the soil's resistance to detachment. In addition to removing a valuable 
resource, soil erosion leads to increased sediment input to nearby rivers and thus deposition in the river 
systems including reservoirs. 
Sediment transport in rivers is particularly important for the global geochemical cycle and the transport of 
organic carbon from the land to the oceans by rivers (Ludwig et al, 1996). Sediment transport in rivers

 depends on both sediment properties and hydraulic parameters. Particle shape affects the incipient motion 
of sediment (Wang and Dittrich, 1999) and hydraulic parameters influence the sediment transport  
capacity and the river dynamics (Wang and Wu, 2001). Furthermore, land use may exert a significant 
influence on runoff and sediment yield (Lu and Huang, 2003; Sui et al. 2000 and 2005, Wang and Wang, 
1999). 
As pointed out by Walling and Fang (2003), the land-ocean transfer of sediment by rivers is a key 
component of the global denudation system and provides a general measure of the rate of denudation of the 
continent. With the growth of interest in global change, many researchers have attempted to assess the 
changes in runoff and sediment transport by rivers.  Existing research results indicate that sediment 
transport by rivers has tended to decrease globally in recent years. Walling (2003, 2006) carried out 
extensive investigations to assess the changes in annual runoff and sediment loads measured at the furthest 
downstream gauging stations of 142 world rivers. He showed that rivers with an increasing annual runoff, 
decreasing annual runoff and stable annual runoff accounted for 8.5%, 22.5% and 69.0% of the total, 
respectively. In the case of sediment transport, rivers with an increasing annual sediment load, a decreasing 
annual sediment load and a stable annual sediment load accounted for 2.8%, 47.9% and 49.3% of the total, 
respectively. 
Many rivers in China, especially the Yellow River, have sediment problems. With the booming economy 
and industrial development as well as urbanization, several characteristics of the watersheds, such as the 
percentage of vegetation cover (including secondary vegetation), may be dramatically changed. As a result, 
the rainfall- runoff process should be different from its original condition and sediment transport by the 
river systems should change. The purpose of the research was to assess the changes in annual runoff and 
sediment transport for 10 important large rivers in China, by using long-term observation data released in 
the China Gazette of River Sedimentation (WMR, 2001-2005, 2006). 
 
2 STUDIED RIVERS AND DATA BASE 
Ten important large rivers located across China (as shown in Fig. 1) have been selected to assess the 
changes in runoff and sediment transport.  From the far north to the far south, these 10 rivers include: the 
Songhua River (at Harbin Station), the Liaohe River (at Tieling Station), the Yongding River (at Yanchi 
Station), the Yellow River (at Lijin Station), the Huaihe River (at Bengbu Station), the Yangtze River (at 
Datong Station), the Qiantang River (at Lanxi Station), the Minjiang River (at Zhuqi Station), the 
 
 
Gauging stations on studied rivers: 
1. Harbin station on the Songhua River   6. Datong station on the Yangtze River 
2. Tieling station on the Liaohe River   7. Lanxi station on the Qiantang River 
3. Yanchi station on the Yongding River   8. Zhuqi station on the Minjiang River 
4. Lijin station on the Yellow River   9. Boluo station on the Dongjiang River 
5. Bengbu station on the Huaihe River  10. Gaoyao station on the Xijiang River

 Dongjiang River (at Boluo Station) and the Xijiang River (at Gaoyao Station). Nine out of these 10 rivers 
enter the East Sea or the South Sea of China. The Songhua River, a tributary of the Heilong River (Amur 
River), flows northeast into Russia and then discharges into the ocean. 
For each river, the data for the gauging station furthest downstream released in the China Gazette of River 
Sedimentation have been used. As shown in Table 1, the period of record ranges from 29 years to 56 years. 
The data series at most gauging stations are more than 50 years long. The drainage areas range from 18,233 
km2 (the Qiantang River at Lanxi) to 1,705,383 km2 (the Yangtze River at Datong). The drainage area of the 
Yellow River at the Lijin Station is 752,032 km2.

Precipitation depth is one important factor affecting the magnitude of runoff and thus the sediment 
transport by a river system. For this study, long term annual precipitation depths from some climate 
stations in the associated watersheds have been assessed. As shown in Table 2, the data series at most 
climate stations are more than 50 years long. Table 2 gives the average long term and short term (in the 
past 10 years) annual precipitation depths. Table 2 also gives ratios of the average precipitation depths in 
the past 10 years to those of long term values for studied climate stations. 
 
3 Results 
In this paper, the annual runoff per area (annual average discharge per unit area, l/s.km2) and the 
annual sediment yield per area (annual suspended sediment flux per unit area, t/km2.yr) have been 
used to compare the changes in runoff and sediment flux associated with the 10 large rivers in China. 
To assess the changes in runoff and sediment flux for each river, trend analysis for the annual runoff 
and the annual sediment yield has been conducted. Additionally, the dependence of the annual 
sediment yield on the annual runoff has been explored for each river. 
Conceptually, the changes of annual sediment transport depend mainly on the runoff pattern and the 
erodibility of a watershed. Precipitation depth is one important factor affecting the magnitude of the 
annual runoff. On the other hand, annual sediment transport in a river may be significantly changed by 
the impact of human activities such as water and soil conservation programs, sediment trapping dams 
(mainly used in the Yellow River watershed), as well as reservoir construction and hydropower 
development in the watershed. 
Based on trend analysis of the time series of the annual runoff and the sediment yield for these 10 rivers, 
the changes in both annual runoff and sediment transport were found to vary from river to river. These 
changes depended on the nature and magnitude of human impact, including changes in vegetation cover 
and the installation/operation of hydraulic structures on the rivers. Overall, the annual sediment yield in all 
rivers decreased over time but the annual runoff showed no evidence of a significant decrease for some 
rivers.  Based on the changes in annual runoff and sediment yield shown in Fig. 2, the 10 large rivers in 
China can be subdivided into the following three groups: 1) rivers with decreasing sediment transport and 
stable runoff; 2) rivers with both decreasing sediment transport and decreasing runoff and 3) rivers with 
greatly reduced sediment transport and decreasing runoff.

3.1 Rivers with decreasing sediment transport and stable runoff 
As shown in Fig. 2, for all southern rivers (including the Huaihe, Yangtze, Qiantang, Minjiang,  
Dongjiang and Xijiang rivers) and the Songhua River which is located in the largest national forest region 
in the far north of China, the annual runoff is essentially stationary. As indicated by the trend functions 
QRI(T), the trend coefficients are small. However, the trend lines for the annual sediment yield for the 
southern rivers are all characterized by a clear downward trend. 
 
3.1.1 The Huaihe River at the Bengbu station 
The annual sediment load of the Huaihe River shows an overall tendency to decreases through time, 
although the runoff record provides evidence of only a very slight decrease. As shown in Fig. 2, a 
significant increase in the annual sediment yield occurred between 1960 and 1965. This high value is likely 
to reflect the “conversion of forest to farmland” process that occurred during this period. This resulted in 
increased soil erosion and an increased annual sediment yield for the Huaihe River. As shown in Fig. 2, 
there is a good linear relationship between the cumulative annual runoff and the cumulative annual 
sediment yield before 1978. In the 1980’s, both annual runoff and sediment transport were fairly high but 
they decreased significantly in the 1990’s. By the end of the1990’s, annual runoff and sediment transport 
had increased again. The changes of annual runoff during this period were closely related to the variation of 
annual precipitation over the Huaihe River watershed (Wang and Wang, 2002).  
As shown in Fig. 3, the annual precipitation depth in the Huaihe River watershed has slightly increased. 
After 1975 and especially after 1990, several water and soil conservation programs, which covered an area 
of 10.44 ×103 km2, were established in the Huaihe River watershed. This resulted in a significant decrease 
in the annual sediment yield.  The long term average annual runoff per area for the Huaihe River is 6.99

 l/s.km2 and this has decreased to 6.47 l/s.km2 in the past 10 years. The annual sediment yield of the Huaihe 
River is fairly low. The long term average annual sediment yield per area of the Huaihe River is only 75.5 
t/km2.yr. However, in the past 10 years, the average annual sediment yield per area of the Huaihe River was 
reduced to 42.8 t/km2.yr. The annual sediment yield is closely dependent on the annual runoff.

3.1.2 The Yangtze River at the Datong station 
The Yangtze River is the largest river in China. The long term average (1950-2005) annual runoff and 
sediment transport at Datong are 903×109 m3 and 414 ×106 t. Table 1 shows the long term average annual 
runoff per area for the Yangtze River is 16.8 l/s.km2 but this increased to 17.56 l/s.km2 in the past 10 years. 
It can be seen in Fig. 3 that the annual precipitation depth in the Yangtze River watershed has a tendency 
of slightly increase. Table 2 contains annual precipitation depths of 16 climate stations in the Yangtze 
International Journal of Sediment Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2008, pp. 44-55                      - 49 - 
 River watershed. One can conclude that the annual precipitation depths at most climate stations in the 
Yangtze River watershed generally increased in the past 10 year. This is likely to be responsible for the 
slight increase in the annual runoff. This result confirms the finding of Yang et al (2005) based on the 
discharge records between 1950 and 2004 at the Datong station on the Yangtze River, although Yang et al 
(2004, 2005) claimed that the discharge at the Datong station should have had a significant decreasing 
trend from 1865 to 2004 based on the analysis on the regression relationship between the discharge at the 
Datong station and those at the upstream Hankou station.

The annual sediment yield per area of the Yangtze River is fairly high with a long term average value of 
242.7 t/km2.yr. However, in the past 10 years, the average annual sediment yield per area of the Yangtze 
River has dropped to 164.70 t/km2.yr. As shown in Fig. 2, a significant increase in the annual sediment 
yield occurred between 1960 and 1967, during the “conversion of forest to farmland” process through 
clear-cutting. In 1967, the Danjiangkou Reservoir, which is located on the Hanjiang River - one of the 
largest tributaries of the Yangtze River, was completed and put into operation. The annual sediment yield of 
the Yangtze River therefore decreased after 1967. However, the Yangtze River experienced an increase in 
its annual sediment yield between 1977 and 1985. The high annual sediment yield of the Yangtze River 
during this period probably reflects the construction of the second largest hydropower project in China - the 
Gezhouba Hydropower Plant - between 1974 and 1988 and the high annual runoff depth during this period. 
After the mid 1980’s the annual sediment yield at the Datong station gradually decreased. The decrease in 
sediment transport by the Yangtze River during this period may be related to: (a) the impact of water and 
soil conservation programs (the Project of Yangtze Upstream Water and Soil Conservation) which begun 
in 1988 (Xu, et al, 2006); (b) the installation of several reservoirs and hydro-power stations on the 
Yangtze River system and (c) increased sand mining (50 ×106 t/year from 1990 to 2002) within the 
Yangtze River watershed. In 2003, the Three Gorges Reservoir on the Yangtze River, the largest 
hydropower project in the world, started to impound water. In 2003–2004, sediment loads at Yichang 
declined by 164 million tons relative to 2002. As pointed out by Xu et al (2006), by 2004, at Yichang and 
Datong stations, the Yangtze River transported only 12 percent and 33 percent, respectively, of its 
1950–1986 loads. More than half of this decrease (65% and 60%) occurred prior to the Three Gorges 
Dam impoundment. Overall, the long term annual runoff of the Yangtze River shows a slightly increasing 
trend over the period of record.  However, over the same period, the long term annual sediment yield 
shows a clear reduction through time.  As shown in Fig. 2, there was a clear break in the trend of the plot of 
cumulative annual sediment yield versus cumulative annual runoff in 1989 and 2003.  However, there is 
no clear relationship between the annual sediment yield and the runoff. 
 
3.1.3 The Qiantang River at the Lanxi station 
The Qiantang River watershed has a very good vegetation cover. In the past half century, significant 
impacts from human activity have not been observed in this watershed. As shown in Fig. 2, the annual 
runoff of the Qiantang River experiences a slightly upward trend, although the annual precipitation depth 
in the Qiantang River watershed has a slight decrease, as shown in Fig. 3. However, the annual sediment 
yield shows a tendency to decrease slightly with time. As indicated in Table 1, the long term average annual 
runoff per area of the Qiantang River is 28.75 l/s.km2 which is fairly high and this has decreased to 28.16 
l/s.km2 in the past 10 years. The long term average annual sediment yield per area of the Qiantang River is 
108.7 t/km2.yr and this has decreased to 87.9 t/km2.yr in the past 10 years. There is a well-defined 
relationship between the annual sediment yield and the annual runoff. 
 
3.1.4 The Minjiang River at the Zhuqi station 
As the trend lines in Fig. 2 show, the long term annual runoff of the Minjiang River is essentially 
stationary, although the annual precipitation depth in the Minjiang River watershed undergoes a slightly 
decrease as shown in Fig. 3. As Table 2 indicates, the annual precipitation depth in the past 10 years has had 
a slight upward trend. However, the long term annual sediment yield decreased with time. After 1993, there 
was a clear decrease in sediment transport which can be attributed to the construction of the Shuikou 
Reservoir in the headwater region. Additionally, extensive sand mining (about 1 M t/yr) in recent years has 
also affected the annual sediment yield of the Minjiang River. The relationship between the annual 
sediment yield and the annual runoff for this river is weak. As indicated by the plot of the cumulative 
annual sediment yield, sediment transport of the Minjinag River was fairly low from 1955 to 1961 and after 
1993. The long term average annual runoff per area of the Minjiang River is 31.13 l/s.km2, which is the 
highest of these 10 rivers and it increased to 32.09 l/s.km2 over the past 10 years. The long term average 
annual sediment yield per area of the Minjiang River is 110.1 t/km2.yr and this has decreased significantly 
to 42.9 t/km2.yr over the past 10 years.

 3.1.5 The Dongjiang River at the Boluo station 
The annual precipitation depth in the Dongjiang River watershed has a slightly increasing trend as 
shown in Fig. 3. However, as indicated in Fig. 2, the annual sediment yield in the Dongjiang River has 
exhibited a noticeable decrease since 1973. The Fengshuba Reservoir built in 1973, the expansion of the 
Baipen reservoir and the installation/operation of the Bapenzhu Hydropower Station on the Dongjiang 
River should be responsible for this decrease in sediment transport.  A well defined relationship between 
the annual sediment yield and the runoff is shown for this river in Fig. 2. The long term average runoff per 
area of the Dongjiang River is 28.89 l/s.km2 and this has decreased to 27.64 l/s.km2 during the past 10 years. 
The long term average annual sediment yield per area of the Dongjiang River is 97.0 t/km2.yr and this has 
decreased to 57.6 t/km2.yr over the past 10 years. 
 
3.1.6 The Xijiang River at the Gaoyao station 
As shown in Fig. 3, the annual precipitation depth in the Xijiang River watershed shows a slightly 
decreasing trend. Both the annual runoff and the sediment yield for this river are characterized by a 
quasi-stationary trend over the period of record, although the annual sediment yield fluctuates dramatically 
at times. As shown in Fig. 2, an obvious increase in the annual sediment yield occurred in the early 1980’s. 
The construction of several reservoirs in this watershed is likely to be responsible for this increase.  In 
1992, the Yantan reservoir on the Xijiang River was completed and was put into operation. This resulted 
in a clear decrease in the sediment load of this river. Since 2003, the Longtan Reservoir has been under 
construction and this has resulted in a further decrease in sediment transport. The long term average annual 
runoff per area of the Xijiang River is 19.86 l/s.km2, and this increased to 20.40 l/s.km2 over the past 10 
years. The long term average annual sediment yield per area of the Xijiang River is 193.4 t/km2.yr and this 
has decreased to 134.1 t/km2.yr during the past 10 years. There is a well-defined relationship between the 
annual sediment yield and the runoff for this river.  
 
3.1.7 The Songhua River at the Harbin station 
The Songhua River is located in the far north of China. However, since the majority of the Songhua River 
watershed is covered by dense forest and human impact is limited, there is no clear trend in the average 
annual runoff and the annual sediment yield for this river. However, both show some evidence of a slight 
downward trend, as shown in Fig. 2. The slight decrease in the annual precipitation depth in the Songhua 
River watershed as shown in Fig. 3 could be responsible for this. Although 2 hydropower plants (Baishan 
and Hongshi hydropower plants) were installed between 1981 and 1989 on the Second Songhua River – a 
major tributary of the Songhua River, no significant impacts have been observed on the annual sediment 
yield and annual runoff of the main river. The long term average annual runoff per area of the Songhua 
River is 3.45 l/s.km2, this has decreased to 2.96 l/s.km2 over the past 10 years. The long term average 
annual sediment yield per area of the Songhua River is 16.7 t/km2.yr and this has decreased to 12.3 t/km2.yr 
for the past 10 years. There is a strong relationship between the annual sediment yield and the annual 
runoff for this river.  For instance, the high annual runoff in 1960, 1988, and 1998, resulted in a high 
sediment yield for these years. 
 
3.2 Rivers with greatly reduced sediment transport and decreasing runoff - The Yongding River at the 
Yanchi station 
One of the northern rivers included in the study, the Yongding River, is characterized by unique changes in 
runoff and sediment transport. The Yongding River is a sandy river, which is a main branch of the Haihe 
River system. As shown in Fig. 2, the annual sediment yield reduced markedly and approached zero 
between1968 and 1973 as well as after 1976. Overall, the annual runoff decreased significantly, especially 
after 1980. The long term average annual runoff per area of the Yongding River is only 0.48 l/s.km2 which 
is very low and this has decreased further to only 0.24 l/s.km2 over the past 10 years. The clear decrease in 
the annual precipitation depth in the Yongding River watershed as shown in Fig. 3 may be responsible for 
this. The long term average annual sediment yield per area of the Yongding River is only 3.1 t/km2.yr which 
again is extremely low and this has decreased to about 0 t/km2.yr over the past 10 years. Although the 
annual sediment yield remained very low and close to zero over most of the period of record, there were 
occasional peaks. In 1967, for example, the annual sediment yield per area was much higher and this can be 
- 52 -                           International Journal of Sediment Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2008, pp. 44-55 
 accounted for by the releasing of impounded water from the Guanting Reservoir during a flood period in 
August 1967.  In July 1974, high flows were again released during the high flood season to flush out 
deposited sediment from the Guanting Reservoir and this resulted in a high annual sediment yield. The 
Yongding River is a sandy river with serious soil erosion in its upstream reaches.  The average annual 
runoff per area at Yanchi between 1952 and 1954 was 1.26 - 2.1 l/s.km2 and the annual sediment yield per 
area was as high as 1834 and 1632 t/km2.yr in 1952 and 1954 respectively (not shown in Fig. 2). However, 
the Guanting Reservoir, completed in 1954, intercepted most of the runoff and large quantities of 
sediment from upstream. The water discharge and sediment load of the river are now totally different 
from those under natural conditions as they are strongly influenced by human activities such as reservoir 
construction and water diversion. 
 
3.3 Rivers with both decreasing sediment transport and decreasing runoff 
For the northern rivers (including the Liaohe and the Yellow rivers), the trend lines presented in Fig. 2 
show that both the annual runoff and sediment yield decreased markedly over the period of record. 
 
3.3.1 The Liaohe River at the Tieling station 
Long term precipitation records at two climate stations in the Liaohe River watershed have been assessed. 
Annual precipitation depths in this watershed have a slightly downward trend. Overall, both average annual 
runoff and sediment transport were fairly high before 1964. Between 1964 and 1984, both the average 
annual runoff and sediment yield were fairly low. The annual sediment yield was quasi stationary during 
this period. Between 1985 and 1998, both average annual runoff and sediment transport showed significant 
fluctuations. After 1999, both average annual runoff and sediment transport were again fairly low, the 
annual sediment yield approaches a constant and the annual runoff does not change much during this 
period. As observed in Fig. 2, clear changes in the annual sediment yield occurred in 1962, 1983 and 1996. 
From the late 1960’s to the early 1980’s and after the late 1990’s, the Liaohe River watershed received less 
precipitation. The annual runoff and sediment yield in the Liaohe River are also affected by the impact of 
the Hongshan Reservoir. The Hongshan Reservoir started to impound water in 1962 and it trapped most of 
the sediment carried by the Laoha River – a sandy branch river of the Liaohe River. Therefore, the annual 
sediment yield decreased significantly since 1964. In 1985, the dead storage capacity of the Hongshan 
Reservoir was completely filled. From 1962 to 1999, the decrease in the storage capacity of this reservoir 
was 941×106 m3, which accounts for 36.8% of the total storage capacity of this reservoir (Zhou and Zhaolun, 
2005). The long term average annual runoff per area of the Liaohe River is 0.80 l/s.km2 which is fairly low 
and this has decreased to 0.45 l/s.km2 over the past 10 years. The long term average annual sediment yield 
per area of the Liaohe River is 103.5 t/km2.yr and this decreased dramatically to a value of 23.4 t/km2.yr for 
the past 10 years. The relationship between the annual sediment yield and the annual runoff is very strong. 
 
3.3.2 The Yellow River at the Lijin station 
The Yellow River is well-known for its very high sediment load. Between 1952 and 2005, at the Lijin 
Station on the Lower Reach of the Yellow River, the average annual sediment transport was 0.78 × 109 t, 
with an average annual sediment concentration of 24.8 kg/m3 (WMR, 2005). The Yellow River watershed 
is located in a semi-arid region. Based on the long term (about 50 years long) precipitation records from 
77 climate stations in the Yellow River watershed, Xu and Zhang (2006) reported that there was no clear 
change in the annual precipitation over the sub-watershed of the Upper Reach of the Yellow River. For 
this study, long term data series of four climate stations were assessed. Annual precipitation depths in the 
headwater region and the Lower Reach sub-watershed have a slightly downward trend. However, a clear 
downward trend of annual precipitation depth in the Middle Reach sub-watershed of the Yellow River is 
observed, as shown in Fig. 3. 
The main methodologies used for water and soil conservation in the Yellow River watershed include 
contour cultivation, enlargement of the vegetated area and construction of small sediment trapping dams 
in the easily eroded valleys. Before 1960, there was no hydropower development on the Yellow River. 
Additionally, no water and soil conservation programs had been conducted in the Yellow River watershed 
before 1960. Starting in the late 1960’s, extensive water and soil conservation programs have been carried 
out in the Yellow River watershed. As reported by Gu (1994, 2002), the area with water and soil 
International Journal of Sediment Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2008, pp. 44-55                      - 53 - 
 conservation programs was only 8.0 thousand km2  prior to 1959. This area increased to 15.8, 36.0, 79.2 
and 171.3 thousands km2 by 1969, 1979, 1989 and 1999 respectively. By 2005, 171 large 
reservoirs/hydropower stations had been constructed in the Yellow River watershed (WMR, 2006). 
The Sanmenxia Reservoir exerts a very important influence on sediment transport in the Lower Reach of 
the Yellow River. As demonstrated by Fig. 2, the annual sediment yield at the Lijin Station on the Yellow 
River shows three clearly marked decreases in 1961, 1980 and 2000. Before 1960, the Yellow River was 
under essentially natural conditions. The sediment transport was high and the annual runoff was low. 
From 1960 to 1964, the Sanmenxia Reservoir was in operation for impounding water and trapping 
sediment. Thus, annual sediment transport downstream at the Lijin Station decreased dramatically. From 
1965 to 1973, the operating mode of the Sanmenxia Reservoir was changed to provide flood detention 
and sediment flushing. Thus, both annual sediment transport and runoff at the Lijin Station increased 
during this period. From 1974 to 1985, the operating mode of the Sanmenxia Reservoir was further 
modified to provide for “storing clear water during low flow seasons and releasing turbid water during 
flood periods”. Since 1980, water consumption by agriculture and industry has increased significantly. 
The annual water consumption by agriculture in the whole basin increased to 27.4 billion m3 in 1980s 
from 12.5 billion m3 in 1950s (Gu, 1994). Additionally, many soil and water conservation projects have 
been completed in the Loess Plateau in the Middle Reach of the Yellow River. Therefore, both annual 
sediment transport and runoff at the Lijin Station on the Lower Reach of the Yellow River decreased 
significantly after 1980. This trend in the annual runoff and sediment yield reflects the impact of reservoir 
operation and the increase in water consumption in the Middle and Upper reaches of the Yellow River. 
The annual runoff at the Lijin Station increased after 2002. This increase was caused by the operation of 
the Xiaolangdi Reservoir which is used to create high flows for scouring/dredging the channel of the 
Lower Reach. However, as shown by the trend lines in Fig. 2, both the annual runoff and sediment yield of 
the Yellow River demonstrate a clear downward trend overall. The long term average annual runoff per 
area of the Yellow River at the Lijin Station is only 1.32 l/s.km2 and this has decreased further to 0.46 
l/s.km2 over the past 10 years. The long term average annual sediment yield per area of the Yellow River at 
the Lijin Station is 1034.5 t/km2.yr, which is extremely high but this has decreased to 256.1 t/km2.yr during 
the past 10 years. The relationship between the annual sediment yield and the annual runoff is very strong 
for this river. 
 
4 Conclusions 
In this paper, changes in annual runoff and sediment transport have been assessed by using the long term 
observation data from 10 gauging stations on 10 large rivers across China. It has been shown that annual 
sediment transport has generally been characterized by a decreasing trend over the past half century. 
Based on the changes in the annual runoff and the sediment yield, the large rivers in China included in 
this study can be classified into the following three groups: 1) rivers with decreasing sediment transport 
and stable runoff; 2) rivers with both decreasing sediment transport and decreasing runoff and 3) rivers 
with greatly reduced sediment transport and decreasing runoff. 
From a long-term point of view, for all the southern rivers, there has been little change in annual runoff 
but a dramatic decrease in the annual sediment yield. Human activities, such as regulation of the flow by 
reservoirs, have had an impact on most southern rivers. In the northern rivers, however, both annual 
sediment transport and runoff show a tendency to reduce. The Yongding River is a sandy river which 
forms a main branch of the Haihe River. The annual sediment yield surprisingly approaches zero between 
1968 and 1973 as well as after 1976 and the annual runoff decreases significantly, especially after 1980. 
From a short-term perspective, the annual sediment yield of most rivers included in the study decreased 
significantly. In some northern rivers, the ratio of the short-term annual sediment yield to the long-term 
annual sediment yield is less than 50%, for example, 1% for the Yongding River, 23% for the Liaohe 
River and 25% for the Yellow River. 
The results presented clearly demonstrate the impact of human activity on changes in runoff and 
sediment transport. In the Lower Reach of the Yellow River, the changes in runoff and sediment transport 
have been dramatically influenced by human activities, such as reservoir construction and the mode of 
operation of the reservoir, the increase in water consumptions and the introduction of soil and water 
conservation programs in the sub-watershed of the Middle and Lower reaches of the Yellow River. The 
- 54 -                           International Journal of Sediment Research, Vol. 23, No. 1, 2008, pp. 44-55 
 long term average annual sediment yield per area at the Lijin Station on the Lower Reach of the Yellow 
River is 1034.5 t/km2.yr which is extremely high. Due to the impact of human activity, including the 
operation of hydropower stations/reservoirs on the Yellow River, construction of sediment trapping dams, 
as well as soil conservation programs in the Yellow River watershed, the average annual sediment yield per 
area has decreased significantly over the past 10 years, to only 256.1 t/km2.yr.
