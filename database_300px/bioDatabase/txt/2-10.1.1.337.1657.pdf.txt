Abstract
Previously, we showed that N-methyl-N-nitrosourea–trans-
formed MCF12F breast epithelial cells exhibited differential
expression of several genes, including up-regulation of
prohibitin and elevated sensitivity to a relatively noncalcemic
vitamin D analogue, 1A-hydroxyvitamin D5 [1A(OH)D5]. In
this report, we evaluated the functional significance of
prohibitin in relation to the cellular response to vitamin D.
The in silico screening for putative transcription factor
binding sites identified two vitamin D receptor (VDR)/retinoid
X receptor binding sites in the 1-kb promoter region of
prohibitin. Prohibitin up-regulation by 1A(OH)D5 treatment
at both transcriptional and translational levels was confirmed
by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot
analysis in breast cancer cells, identifying prohibitin as a
vitamin D target gene. Confocal microscopic analysis showed
that prohibitin was localized in the nuclei of MCF-7 cells and
a portion of prohibitin was colocalized with VDR, but
direct physical interaction between VDR and prohibitin in
cell lysates was not detectable. In MCF-7 cells expressing
tetracycline-inducible prohibitin (Tet-On model), the over-
expression of prohibitin inhibited cell proliferation and
enhanced vitamin D–induced antiproliferative activity.
Knockdown of prohibitin was accompanied by increased
number of cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine in the
whole population and increased cell distribution in the S
phase of cell cycle. In addition, prohibitin level had no
significant effect on the vitamin D–induced transactivation of
CYP24 , a VDR target gene. This is the first report to suggest
that prohibitin serves as a novel vitamin D target gene, which
is involved in the antiproliferative action of vitamin D without
affecting CYP24 transactivation in breast cancer cells. (Cancer
Res 2006; 66(14): 7361-9)
Introduction
It is now well recognized that the active metabolite of vitamin
D plays a significant role as a modulator of cell proliferation and
differentiation in addition to its principal function in bone
mineralization. However, its clinical use in cancer prevention and
therapy is hampered due to its toxic effects at efficacious
concentration. Therefore, considerable effort has been diverted
toward designing and synthesizing chemical analogues of vitamin
D that are less calcemic and more potent in inhibiting growth of
cancer cells. We synthesized one such less calcemic analogue, 1a-
Hydroxy-24-ethyl-cholecalciferol [1a(OH)D5], which has shown
promising chemopreventive effect in mouse mammary organ
culture system (1, 2), chemically induced rat mammary
carcinogenesis and breast cancer xenograft model using athymic
mice (3, 4). To this end, 1a(OH)D5 is being developed for phase I
clinical trials for breast cancer patients. Our previous effort to
identify transformation-associated genes using microarray anal-
ysis found that several genes were up-regulated in carcinogen-
transformed human breast epithelial cells compared with the
untransformed cells (MCF12F), including prohibitin, TCTP1, and
thioredoxin (3, 5). Because it is well known that vitamin D
arrests epithelial cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle whereas
prohibitin has been reported to have tumor-suppressive and
antiproliferative effects, we selected prohibitin to determine if
it has any functional significance in vitamin D action. The
prohibitin gene encodes a protein of 275 amino acids with a
molecular mass of 28 to 30 kDa. It is highly evolutionarily
conserved and mapped to chromosome 17q12-21 (6). Its protein
is localized into the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where
it might have a role as a mitochondrial chaperon protein in a
complex with BAP37 in the maintenance of mitochondrial
function and protection against senescence (7–9). In addition,
prohibitin also plays a regulatory role within the cell cycle,
although the precise role of the protein in cell cycle regulation is
not well understood (10). Earlier work considered prohibitin as
a potential tumor suppressor gene because microinjection of
prohibitin transcripts resulted in growth arrest in HeLa cells (11).
Prohibitin has also been reported to be localized to the nuclei of
breast cancer cells (12) and to mediate hormone response in
prostate cancer and ovary granulosa cells (13, 14). There is
evidence for the interaction of prohibitin with the cell cycle
checkpoint molecules, including E2F (15), p53 (12), and pRB
(16, 17), and the overexpression of prohibitin can modulate
transcription of multiple genes in the transfection experiments.
This suggests a potential mechanism of prohibitin function in
cell cycle regulation (12, 15, 17). Recent reports indicate that
prohibitin is up-regulated in tumor cells compared with normal
cells (18–20). Moreover, it has been reported as one of the target
genes for c-Myc (21, 22). The consistently higher levels of
prohibitin in cancer cells may be due to the transactivation of
c-Myc gene (8). Thus, it seems that prohibitin is involved in
diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, stress (7), cell
migration (23), etc., associated with its different localization in
the cells; however, its nuclear function is still far from clear. Our
attempt to characterize the role of prohibitin in vitamin D
receptor (VDR) function led to the identification of prohibitin as
a novel vitamin D target gene that is involved in the
antiproliferative action of vitamin D without affecting CYP24
transactivation in breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Vitamin D analogue. 1a(OH)D5 was synthesized according to the
procedure described previously (1). 1a(OH)D5 was dissolved in ethanol, and
the stock solution of 10 mmol/L 1a(OH)D5 in ethanol was stored in 80jC
freezer. The appropriate controls for each experiment consisted of
treatment with the vehicle (ethanol) used at a concentration <0.01% of
total cell culture medium. 1,25(OH)2D3 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Corp. (St. Louis, MO).
Cell culture. MCF-7, BT474, and MDA-MB231 cell lines were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as
described previously (24). MCF-7 cells expressing tetracycline-inducible
prohibitin (tagged by c-Myc) were grown in DMEM supplementd with
10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (FBS; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA),
25 Ag/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 0.25 Ag/mL Blasticidine
(Invitrogen) as described (12). Prohibitin was induced by incubation of cells
with 1 Ag/mL tetracycline or 20 ng/mL doxycycline in the MCF-7 Tet-On
model. A day before treatment, cells were seeded and incubated for 24 hours
in growth medium to allow cells to attach and the serum in the medium
was reduced to 5%. Then, cells were then treated with 0.5 Amol/L 1a(OH)D5
or 10 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for different times. For long treatments, medium
was changed every other day.
RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA
extraction and reverse transcription reaction were done as described
previously (24). RNA was further subjected to DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX)
digestion and purification using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
before reverse transcription. Real-time PCR was done with 1 AL reverse
transcription product in a MyiQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) by using iQ SYBR Green PCR Supermix (Bio-Rad) according
to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The PCR cycling conditions used were as
follows: 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95jC, 15 seconds at 60jC, and 20 seconds
at 72jC. Fold inductions were calculated using the formula 2(DDC t), where
DDCt is DCt(treatment)  DCt(control), DCt is Ct(target gene)  Ct(actin), and Ct is
the cycle at which the threshold is crossed. The gene-specific primer pairs
(and product size) for the gene analyzed here were as follows: prohibitin ,
5¶-ACCACGTAATGTGCCAGTCA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TAGTCCTCTCC-
GATGCTGGT-3¶ (reverse; 126 bp); CYP24 , 5¶-CTCAGCAGCCTAGTGCA-
GATT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-ACTGTTTGCTGTCGTTTCCAC-3¶ (reverse;
122 bp); and b-actin , 5¶-CTCTTCCAGCCTTCC-TTCCT-3¶ ( forward) and
5¶-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3¶ (reverse; 116 bp). PCR product quality
was monitored using post-PCR melt curve analysis.
Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was evaluated using 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, direct
cell counting, and bromodexyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay. MTT
assay was described previously (24). Cells (1,000) per well were initially
seeded in 96-well plates for MTT assay. For direct cell counting, cells were
initially seeded in six-well (5,000 per well) or 12-well (2,000 per well) plates;
after treatment, cells were trypsinized and cell number was determined by
direct counting using Z1 Coulter Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA) with size setting at 8 to 12 Am. For BrdUrd incorporation
assay, 10 Amol/L BrdUrd (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to the
medium 2 hours before harvesting cells. Cells were trypsinized, washed with
PBS, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes followed by
incubation in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 30 minutes at 37jC. Cells
were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody
(Calbiochem) overnight at 4jC, washed twice, and incubated with FITC-
conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for
1 hour at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, cells were
subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis; a total of
20,000 events were measured per sample. BrdUrd incorporation assay is a
more sensitive assay for cell proliferation, which was used to evaluate cell
proliferation potential in MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with small
interfering RNA (siRNA).
Fluorescent immunostaining and confocal microscopy. MCF-7 cells
were grown on coverslips for 24 hours. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed
in buffered formalin. Fixed cells were then washed thrice with PBS
containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS
for 5 minutes, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST for
30 minutes, and then incubated with anti-VDR rat monoclonal antibody
(mAb; 1:200; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Cells were washed and incubated with FITC-labeled anti-rat secondary
antibody for 1 hour. Antibody incubation steps were repeated with anti-
prohibitin mouse mAb (NeoMarkers) and Texas red–labeled anti-mouse
secondary antibody. After staining nuclei with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-
indole (DAPI), cells were visualized with Zeiss LSM 510 (Zeiss, Thornwood,
NY) confocal microscope and areas of colocalization were determined using
LSM 510 software (Zeiss).
Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. When cells grew
to 50% to 70% confluence, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to either
Western blot analysis as described previously (24) or coimmunoprecipita-
tion. Mouse anti-prohibitin mAb was purchased from NeoMarkers. Rabbit
polyclonal VDR antibody, c-Myc mouse mAb, and all secondary antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For
coimmunoprecipitation, cell lysates (500 Ag) were incubated with VDR
polyclonal antibody or c-Myc mAb in 300 AL binding buffer [50 mmol/L
HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 100 Amol/L
NaF, 200 Amol/L Na3VO4, proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich),
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% NP40] on a rocker platform
for 3 hours at 4jC. Then, 30 AL protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was added to each sample for overnight incubation. The
agarose beads were washed five times with 600 AL of the same binding
buffer, boiled in 20 AL SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot
analysis (24).
Expression plasmid and transfection. The prohibitin expression vector
pcDNA3.1PHB was generated by PCR cloning using pcDNA3.1/V5-His
TOPO TA Expression kit (Invitrogen). The open reading frame of
prohibitin was isolated by PCR of full-length cDNA from MCF10A breast
epithelial cells using primers containing start and stop codons [prohibitin,
5¶-GGAAACATGGC-TGCCAAAGTG-3¶ (start) and 5¶-GCCCTCACTGGGGC-
AGCTG-3¶ (stop)]. Orientation and sequence of the construct were verified
by direct sequencing. Transient transfection was done in the same culture
medium containing 2% FBS using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in
12-well plates per manufacturer’s manual (24). Cells (1.5  105 per well)
were transfected with 0.5 Ag/well pcDNA3.1 empty vector (control) or
0.53 Ag/well pcDNA3.1PHB expression vector. After 5 hours of incubation,
the medium was replaced with medium containing 10 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3
or ethanol (solvent control, 1 AL/10 mL medium), and cells were incubated
for an additional 24 hours before analysis.
RNA interference. siRNA against prohibitin [prohibitin siRNA, 5¶-
CCCAGAAAUCACUGUGAAAdTdT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-UUUCACAGUGAUUU-
CUGGG-dTdT-3¶ (antisense)] was designed to target the 3¶-untranslated
region at 974 to 993 bp of sequence NM_002634 and synthesized by
Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Negative control siRNA
[nonsilencing RNA, 5¶-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCA-CGUdTdT-3¶ (sense) and
5¶-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3¶ (antisense); Qiagen] has no homo-
logy to known mammalian genes. To knock down prohibitin by RNA
interference (RNAi), 105 cells per well were seeded in six-well plates in
culture medium containing 5% FBS and incubated overnight. Prohibitin
siRNA and nonsilencing siRNA were transfected using the RNAi Carrier kit
(Epoch Biolabs, Sugar Land, TX). Cells were first incubated with siRNA
complex (siRNA at 80 nmol/L; siRNA to RNAi Carrier, 1:6) for 6 hours in
Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 2% FBS, and then FBS was increased to
5%. After overnight incubation, cells were incubated in fresh culture
medium containing 5% FBS for 2 days, and then cells were subjected to
BrdUrd incorporation assay or cell cycle analysis (25). Prohibitin
knockdown was verified at the same time using reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis.
Results
Prohibitin is a vitamin D target gene. Our earlier studies
showed that prohibitin could be involved in cellular response to
1a(OH)D5 in breast epithelial cells (5); therefore, a question was
raised: is prohibitin a vitamin D target gene? To answer this

question, we first analyzed the promoter region of prohibitin to
examine if potential VDR binding sites are present. As shown in
Fig. 1A , the 1-kb 5¶-flanking sequence (1,000/+40) of prohibitin
was analyzed with several transcription binding site identification
programs, including MatInspector (26), Promo (27), TFSEARCH
(http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html), etc. Both
MatInspector (using Matrix Family Library version 6.0 with
optimized similarity score set to be >0.75 for all vertebrates library)
and Promo identified two potential DNA binding sites for VDR/
retinoid X receptor (RXR) located at 958/934 (core similarity,
0.785; matrix similarity, 0.796; positive strand) and 383/359
(core similarity, 0.937; matrix similarity, 0.794; negative strand) of
the 1-kb promoter sequence (Fig. 1A). In addition to the known
binding sites, such as androgen receptor (13) and c-Myc (7), in the
promoter region of prohibitin, MatInspector also identified
multiple DNA binding sites for early growth response (EGR) in
this region (Fig. 1A), which was previously identified as a vitamin D
target gene in cultured hepatic cells (28, 29) and in breast cancer
cells in our laboratory.5 These analyses showed that prohibitin is a
potential vitamin D target gene. To experimentally test if prohibitin
is regulated by vitamin D, we selected BT474 cells to verify the
results of in silico analysis. BT474 is estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
and VDR-positive breast cancer cell line and is also very sensitive
to 1a(OH)D5 treatment (5). A time course analysis of prohibitin
expression at transcriptional level showed that prohibitin mRNA
level started going up at 4 hours after treatment with 1a(OH)D5
(0.5 Amol/L) and peaked at 8 hours (f2-fold increase compared
with basal level); at 24 hours after treatment, prohibitin level
showed 20% to 30% increase compared with the basal level before
treatment (Fig. 1B, top). CYP24 , a direct vitamin D target gene, was
analyzed at the same time to serve as a positive control for cellular
response to vitamin D (Fig. 1B, bottom). Differing from prohibitin
transcription, CYP24 showed continuous transactivation during
the 24-hour time course of 1a(OH)D5 treatment. To confirm if
prohibitin protein is regulated by 1a(OH)D5, Western blot analysis
of prohibitin protein expression in BT474 cells after 24-hour
1a(OH)D5 treatment was done (Fig. 1C). Prohibitin protein was
significantly up-regulated by 1a(OH)D5. These data clearly identify
prohibitin as a vitamin D target gene.
Basal transcriptional level of prohibitin correlates to
cellular sensitivity to vitamin D in breast cancer cells. Because
prohibitin is a vitamin D target gene and was reported to have
antiproliferative effect, we next asked if basal level of prohibitin is
associated with any cellular sensitivity to vitamin D. CYP24
transactivation and antiproliferative effect by vitamin D were used
as two variables for evaluation. Three breast cancer cell lines
(ER-negative MDA-MB231, ER-positive BT474, and MCF-7 cells)
with different sensitivities were selected. As shown in Fig. 2A ,
MDA-MB231 has the lowest basal prohibitin expression level,
whereas BT474 has the highest basal prohibitin expression
level, 6-fold higher compared with that of MDA-MB231 cells; the
basal prohibitin level in MCF-7 is 2-fold higher than that in
MDA-MB231 cells. The basal prohibitin level correlates to cellular
sensitivity in response to vitamin D in these cell lines (Fig. 2B
and C): 1a(OH)D5 at 0.5 Amol/L dramatically induced CYP24
expression after 24-hour treatment and inhibited cell proliferation

CYP24 mRNA expression was analyzed at the same time and served as a positive control for vitamin D response. The value at each time point represents the relative
level of specific mRNA normalized to h-actin (the level of specific mRNA at time point 0 was set as 1). Points, mean of three independent experiments with duplicate

by 50% after 4-day treatment in BT474 cells. MCF-7 cells are
responsive to 1a(OH)D5 treatment but less sensitive compared with
BT474 cells, whereas MDA-MB231 cells were resistant to 1a(OH)D5
treatment. 1a(OH)D5 failed to inhibit cell proliferation and only
slightly induced CYP24 expression in MDA-MB231 cells. These data
show that basal expression level of prohibitin could potentially
contribute to cellular sensitivity to vitamin D in breast cancer cells.
Prohibitin is localized to the nuclei in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells. We examined the distribution of prohibitin and VDR in
MCF-7 cells by fluorescent immunostaining. MCF-7 cells are well

characterized, express moderate level of prohibitin (Fig. 2A), and
used for cell transfection studies in our laboratory. Confocal
microscopic analysis showed that prohibitin was localized in
the nuclei and a portion of prohibitin was colocalized with VDR
(Fig. 3). Such nuclear accumulation of prohibitin has been
previously reported (11–13, 16). The colocalization of prohibitin
and VDR suggested that a potential physical association between
the two molecules could exist and that prohibitin could regulate
VDR-mediated cellular responses.
Characterization of prohibitin expression and its role in
response to vitamin D in MCF-7 prohibitin Tet-On model.
Because prohibitin is a target gene of vitamin D and a direct
physical association between prohibitin and VDR may occur, we
hypothesized that prohibitin expression plays a role in response to
vitamin D. To test this hypothesis, a MCF-7 cell line expressing
tetracycline-inducible c-Myc-tagged prohibitin (prohibitin Tet-On
model; ref. 11) was used. Using this model, we evaluated the
effect of prohibitin overexpression on vitamin D–induced cellular
response. We first confirmed the increased expression of pro-
hibitin with tetracycline (1 Ag/mL) and its derivative doxycycline
(50 ng/mL), the two Tet-system inducers. After 24 hours of
treatment, both inducers effectively induced exogenous prohibitin
expression. The c-Myc-tagged prohibitin was separated with a
molecular mass off34 kDa from the endogenous prohibitin (28-30
kDa; Fig. 4A). Because doxycycline is water soluble and the
induction concentration is much lower than tetracycline, we
further optimized the concentration of doxycycline used in this
Tet-On system. The cells were treated with different concentrations
of doxycycline, and exogenous prohibitin expression was analyzed
by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). Results showed that doxycycline
induced dose-dependent prohibitin expression with maximum
induction at the concentration of 20 ng/mL. This concentration of
doxycycline was therefore used for all the later experiments.
Because the exogenous prohibitin is c-Myc tagged, we used anti-c-
Myc antibody to confirm that the f34-kDa protein band is in fact
prohibitin by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4C , the
doxycycline-induced f34 kDa protein band was also detected by
anti-c-Myc antibody, whereas in Non-Tet-On MCF-7 cells doxycy-
cline treatment did not induce prohibitin expression. As expected,
reprobing the membrane with anti-prohibitin antibody revealed
that all endogenous and exogenous prohibitin were detected and
that the anti-prohibitin antibody was specific to prohibitin without
cross-reaction with other proteins (Fig. 4D). These results once
again confirm the nuclear localization of prohibitin shown in Fig. 3.
To detect the possible physical interaction between prohibitin and
VDR, coimmunoprecipitation was done using cell lysates made
from cultured MCF-7 Tet-On cells. As shown in Fig. 4E , after
immunoprecipitating proteins with polyclonal anti-VDR and
monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies, the precipitated complexes
were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-prohibitin
antibody (Fig. 4E). The proposed physical interaction between
prohibitin and VDR was not detectable (Fig. 4E, lane 4), whereas
c-Myc antibody precipitated exogenous c-Myc-tagged prohibitin
from cell lysates (Fig. 4E, lane 6). However, reprobing the
membrane with VDR antibody once again failed to detect physical
interaction between prohibitin and VDR (data not shown).
Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4E (lane 6), in addition to exogenous
c-Myc prohibitin band, endogenous prohibitin (28-30 kDa) as well
as multiple protein bands at 90 to 130 kDa were detected by
prohibitin antibodies from c-Myc antibody-precipitated complexes.

The nature of the protein bands at 90 to 130 kDa is not clear at this
time. Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous prohibitin showed
the formation of prohibitin homomers. This is consistent with the
large prohibitin spots (possibly prohibitin homomers) observed in
the nuclei in Fig. 3. To test the effect of prohibitin expression on
vitamin D–induced cellular response, the MCF-7 cells expressing
tetracycline-induced prohibitin were treated with 1a(OH)D5
and 1,25(OH)2D3 in the presence and absence of doxycycline for
4 days and the cell number in each well was determined by
direct counting (Fig. 4F and G). Results showed that induction of
prohibitin expression using doxycycline significantly inhibited cell
proliferation, indicating that prohibitin itself has antiproliferative
effect, which is supported by previous reports (11). Incubation
of Tet-On MCF-7 cells for 4 days with 0.5 Amol/L 1a(OH)D5 or
10 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 effectively inhibited cell proliferation by
f27% in the absence of doxycycline, whereas vitamin D treat-
ments in the presence of doxycycline (Tet-On , prohibitin is
overexpressed) inhibited cell proliferation by f50% in these cells.
On the other hand, the incubation of Non-Tet-On MCF-7 cells with
1,25(OH)2D3 in the presence of doxycycline had no additive
inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, indicating that the additive
effect of vitamin D treatment is associated with the overexpression
of prohibitin. These results support the notion that prohibitin is
involved in the antiproliferative effect of vitamin D and at least
partially contributes to cellular sensitivity to vitamin D.
Silencing of prohibitin using RNAi increased BrdUrd
incorporation and cell distribution in S phase of cell cycle in
MCF-7 cells. Given that prohibitin is a target gene of vitamin D
and that it contributes to the antiproliferative action of vitamin D,
we investigated the effect of knockdown of prohibitin by RNAi on
cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. Cell proliferation was evaluated
using BrdUrd incorporation assay and cell cycle analysis.
Transfection for 24 hours followed by 48 hours of incubation with
regular culture medium containing 5% FBS decreased prohibitin
mRNA by 50% in prohibitin siRNA–transfected cells as measured
by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 5A) and was accompanied with
decreased prohibitin protein expression by 80% as evaluated by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B). BrdUrd incorporation assay using
FACS analysis showed a significant increase (>3-fold) in BrdUrd-
labeled cells after prohibitin knockdown (Fig. 5C and D) compared
with nonsilencing control siRNA-transfected cell. Cell cycle analysis
of prohibitin siRNA–transfected MCF-7 cells showed increased cell
distribution in S phase and decreased cell distribution in G1-G0
phase of cell cycle (Table 1), confirming the results of BrdUrd
incorporation assay after prohibitin is silenced by RNAi.
Prohibitin is not involved in CYP24 transactivation by
vitamin D. Because prohibitin is involved in the antiproliferative
action of vitamin D, we asked if prohibitin is involved in the CYP24
transactivation by vitamin D. CYP24 is an established direct target
gene of VDR and is also a very sensitive marker for vitamin D
response. We initially hypothesized that prohibitin expression
affects the CYP24 transcription expression if a direct physical
interaction between prohibitin and VDR was present, even if it
was not detectable by coimmunoprecipitation. We did real-time
RT-PCR analysis of CYP24 transactivation by vitamin D in the
Figure 5. Correlation of silencing of
prohibitin by RNAi with increased BrdUrd
incorporation in MCF-7 cells. A and B,

Tet-On MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6A) and prohibitin siRNA–transfected
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6B). In MCF-7 Tet-On model, cells were pretreated
with or without doxycycline for 24 hours followed by treatment
with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 nmol/L) for additional 24 hours. As shown in
Fig. 6A , treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 dramatically induced CYP24
mRNA expression as expected; however, induction of prohibitin
expression by pretreatment with doxycycline did not affect CYP24
mRNA expression induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 6A). Similarly,
silencing of prohibitin by siRNA in MCF-7 cells did not affect
CYP24 transactivation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1a(OH)D5
(0.5 Amol/L; Fig. 6B), indicating that CYP24 transactivation by
vitamin D in Tet-On MCF-7 cells and prohibitin siRNA–transfected
MCF-7 cells was not affected by prohibitin expression level. To
further confirm this, we also transiently transfected MDA-MB231
cells expressing low level of prohibitin (Fig. 2A) with prohibitin
expression vector (pcDNA3.1PHB) to overexpress prohibitin in this
cell line. After transfection, cells were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for
24 hours. As shown in Fig. 6C , transient transfection caused
dramatic overexpression of prohibitin as evaluated by real-time RT-
PCR, but CYP24 transactivation by 1,25(OH)2D3 was not signifi-
cantly affected, supporting the results obtained from MCF-7 cells.
Discussion
VDR signaling pathway is fundamental to chemoprevention and
therapy of breast cancer using vitamin D analogues. Although the
antiproliferative effects of vitamin D in breast cancer cells are well
recognized, the detailed signaling pathway and target genes involved
in this process still need to be identified and characterized. In this
study, we identified prohibitin as a novel target gene of VDR function,
which is involved in the antiproliferative action of vitamin D.
Our initial in silico effort identified two potential VDR/RXR
binding sites in the promoter region of prohibitin. Although
whether VDR directly binds to the promoter of prohibitin still
needs further experimental verification, our real-time RT-PCR and
immunoblot analyses have confirmed that prohibitin is a primary
vitamin D target gene. Many vitamin D target genes, including
osteopontin, osteocalcin, calbindin , etc., which are classically
involved in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, have been
identified. In addition, a few cell cycle–regulated genes, such as p21
and cyclin C , are also known to be regulated by vitamin D and
related to the antiproliferative action of vitamin D. The identifi-
cation of prohibitin as a novel vitamin D target gene adds a new
member to the list of vitamin D–responding genes related to cell
cycle control. The transcriptional and translational regulation of
prohibitin by vitamin D is very similar to that of cyclin C (30, 31) in
breast cancer cells. Interestingly, at mRNA level, both prohibitin
and cyclin C are quickly up-regulated after vitamin D treatment
with peaks at 8 and 3 hours after treatment, respectively, followed
by gradual reduction in expression, whereas CYP24 induction lasts
for at least 24 hours. At peak mRNA levels, both prohibitin and
cyclin C are f2-fold of their basal levels (30), whereas at protein
level both are >2-fold of their basal levels (31). Such quick,
transient, and significant regulation of prohibitin by vitamin D
might be a sign of tight control of the expression of this gene in
response to vitamin D.
Prohibitin has multiple functions ranging from a role in aging
(32), epithelial cell migration (23), mitochondrial inheritance (33),
and as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins
in yeast (9) to its role in cell cycle control, apoptosis (12), and as
associated molecules in cell surface receptors in mammalian cells
(34, 35). Accumulative evidence shows its nuclear function in
transcription regulation. Our data show that a portion of prohibitin
colocalizes with VDR in the nuclei of MCF-7 cells, and it is involved
in VDR-mediated antiproliferative action of vitamin D. Prohibitin
was found to interact with multiple molecules in the cells,
including Bap37, Rb, p53, E2F, cRaf-1, a-actinin, and annexin A2
(36), and also form homomers with prohibitin itself (Fig. 4E). These

results suggest that prohibitin may function as large complex
homomers, heteromers, or multimers with other molecules
regardless of its location. Because the primary sequence of
prohibitin has predicted a-helical structures in its COOH-terminal
end (37, 38), which forms the basis for interactions between
prohibitin and other proteins, we initially proposed that prohibitin
could physically interact with VDR and regulate VDR-mediated
cellular response and placed much effort in identifying the
interaction between the two molecules. However, we were not
able to coprecipitate prohibitin with VDR directly from cell lysates
using multiple breast epithelial cell lines and various experiment
conditions, indicating that the affinity between VDR and prohibitin
in the intact cells could be very low or they do not physically
interact with each other in the cells. Later experiments on CYP24
transactivation by vitamin D further support this notion because
CYP24 is a very sensitive marker in response to vitamin D and a
direct target gene of VDR. If prohibitin physically binds to VDR, the
expression level of prohibitin would affect CYP24 transactivation
by vitamin D. However, the results indicated that prohibitin-
mediated vitamin D response on cell proliferation was independent
of CYP24 transactivation.
The detailed mechanism by which prohibitin can induce
antiproliferative and cell cycle regulatory activity, although
intriguing, is yet to be established. There is even considerable
controversy about the function of prohibitin localized in the nuclei.
Because emerging data show the diversified localization and
translocation, it is not surprising to see that prohibitin is
associated with multiple functions in the cells. It is believed that
prohibitin can inhibit cell proliferation by directly interacting with
both pRb and p53 pathways, suggesting a mechanism dependent of
the pRb and p53 pathways is involved in the antiproliferative
effects of prohibitin (10). Recent evidence has shown that
prohibitin recruits Brg-1 and Brm to E2F-responsive promoters
and that this recruitment is required for the repression of E2F-
mediated transcription by prohibitin (35, 39). Brg-1 and Brm are
involved in chromatin remodeling and mediating hormone-
dependent transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors (10),
which could provide a common explanation for the diverse effects
of nuclear prohibitin in different cells. In breast cancer cells, the
depletion of prohibitin by antisense or siRNA strategies inhibits the
growth-inhibitory effect of the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen
and ICI 182,780. Moreover, the transfection of a construct expressing
residues 304 to 357 of E2F, which inhibits the interaction between
prohibitin and E2F, blocked the antiestrogenic effect, suggesting an
important role of prohibitin in the antiproliferative actions of
estrogen antagonists (39). Similar mechanism may also be involved
in the antiproliferative action of vitamin D. In the present study, we
observed that prohibitin is up-regulated by vitamin D treatment and
its level correlates with the cellular sensitivity to vitamin D.
Overexpression of prohibitin enhanced the antiproliferative effect
of vitamin D in MCF-7 cells, whereas knockdown of prohibitin was
associated with increased proliferating cells in the whole-cell
population. These results identify prohibitin as one of the important
molecules involved in the antiproliferative action of vitamin D.
Similarly and in consistence with our studies, in androgen-
stimulated LNCap prostate cancer cells, prohibitin is down-
regulated (13). Interestingly, vitamin D3 and its analogue have been
reported to suppress the androgen-stimulated growth of mouse
mammary carcinoma SC-3 cells (40) and block in vitro and in vivo
androgen-stimulated prostate cell growth (41).
Although prohibitin is involved in the antiproliferative action
of vitamin D, it is not involved in the CYP24 transactivation by
vitamin D, suggesting that vitamin D could use different VDR-
mediated pathways for its antiproliferative effects and CYP24
activation, respectively. Previous studies have also reported that the
growth-inhibitory pathway of 1,25(OH)2D3 could be selectively
abrogated, whereas cells remained sensitive to direct 1,25(OH)2D3
signaling (induction of CYP24; ref. 42). A proposed interaction of
prohibitin with VDR and other steroid receptors is diagrammat-
ically shown in Fig. 7.
This is the first report to indicate that prohibitin is involved in
the antiproliferative action of vitamin D. Our results, together with
the findings of others for the role of prohibitin in the action of
androgen (13) and estrogen antagonists (39), suggest that
prohibitin may regulate the action of steroid hormones.

Figure 7. Schematic model to explain potential mechanism of action of nuclear
prohibitin in cancer cells. Prohibitin is up-regulated by VDR-mediated action of
vitamin D, which in turn inhibits cell proliferation. Action of estrogen antagonists
mediated via ER also requires prohibitin for its antiproliferative action. On the
other hand, prohibitin is down-regulated by androgen and in turn enhances
cell proliferation. Thus, prohibitin might function as a target gene for steroid
hormones and modulate the transcription by recruiting Brg-1/Brm. Prohibitin also
interacts with E2F, p53, and pRb. These interactions ultimately result in the
cell cycle arrest or growth inhibition. AR, androgen receptor.
