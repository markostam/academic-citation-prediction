ABSTRACT
The Snf2 family of helicase-related proteins includes
the catalytic subunits of ATP-dependent chromatin
remodelling complexes found in all eukaryotes.
These act to regulate the structure and dynamic
properties of chromatin and so influence a broad
range of nuclear processes. We have exploited pro-
gress in genome sequencing to assemble a compre-
hensive catalogue of over 1300 Snf2 family members.
Multiple sequence alignment of the helicase-related
regions enables 24 distinct subfamilies to be identi-
fied, a considerable expansion over earlier surveys.
Where information is known, there is a good cor-
relation between biological or biochemical function
and these assignments, suggesting Snf2 family
motor domains are tuned for specific tasks.
Scanningofcomplete genomes reveals all eukaryotes
contain members of multiple subfamilies, whereas
they are less common and not ubiquitous in eub-
acteria or archaea. The large sample of Snf2 pro-
teins enables additional distinguishing conserved
sequence blocks within the helicase-like motor to
be identified. The establishment of a phylogeny
for Snf2 proteins provides an opportunity to make
informed assignments of function, and the identifi-
cation of conserved motifs provides a framework
for understanding the mechanisms by which these
proteins function.
INTRODUCTION
Some 15 years ago Gorbalenya and Koonin (1,2) identified a
large group of proteins sharing a series of short ordered
motifs. The majority of members with known function were
nucleic acid strand separating helicases so the sequences
became known as helicase motifs and were labelled sequen-
tially I, Ia, II, III, IV, V and VI. A number of additional con-
served blocks with broad distributions within these
helicase-like proteins have subsequently been identified,
such as the TxGx (3) and Q motifs (4).
Proteins containing the helicase motifs are subdivided into
several superfamilies on the basis of similarity. Structural
characterizations have revealed that helicase-like superfami-
lies 1 and 2 (SF1 and SF2) are related with a common core
of two recA-like domains (5). The helicase-like enzymes
link ATP hydrolysis to a directed change in the relative ori-
entation of these domains (6). Structural and mutagenesis
studies have shown that each of the conserved motifs in the
active site cleft between the recA-like domains plays a role
in the transformation of chemical energy from ATP hydro-
lysis to mechanical motion. This enzymatic process has
been suggested to represent one application of a more general
mechanism used in many proteins containing a recA-like
domain (7).
Proteins with a helicase-like region of similar primary
sequence to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf2p comprise the
Snf2 family within SF2 (Figure 1A). Indeed, Snf2p was specif-
ically aligned within SF2 by Gorbalenya and Koonin (1). Many
of the first identified Snf2 family members were ATPases
within chromatin remodelling complexes and it was recog-
nized that the presence of a core polypeptide related to Snf2p
is a defining property of ATP-dependent chromatin remod-
elling (8). It is now apparent that the Snf2 family comprises
a large group of ATP-hydrolysing proteins that are ubiquitous
in eukaryotes, but also present in eubacteria and archaea.
At least a subset of Snf2 family proteins act as ATP-
dependent DNA translocases (9–12). Some of these proteins
have also been found to be capable of generating uncon-
strained superhelical torsion in DNA (11,13–17), proposed
to occur as a result of the translocation of DNA into con-
strained loops. This is substantiated by recent analysis of
the action of RSC on single DNA molecules (18). In addition
to distorting DNA, the ATP-dependent action of these

proteins can disrupt chromatin as measured using a range of
different assays (8), although other DNA–protein interactions
can also be affected. For example, Rad54 promotes
Rad51-dependent strand pairing (13), and Mot1 displaces
the TATA-binding protein (TBP) from DNA (19). Thus
although many Snf2 family proteins are likely to act to
alter chromatin structure, this is not the case for all members
of the family.
Early biochemical studies and sequence alignments
suggested that members of the Snf2 family could be further

subdivided into a number of subfamilies (20). These subfami-
lies have traditionally taken the name of the archetypal mem-
ber, such as S.cerevisiae Snf2p (Snf2 subfamily), Drosophila
melanogaster Iswi (Iswi subfamily), Mus musculus Chd1
(Chd subfamily) and S.cerevisiae Rad54p (Rad54 subfamily).
Snf2p, therefore, lends its name to both the collective
Snf2 family and a specific Snf2 subfamily (Figure 1A).
The only comprehensive analysis of the Snf2 family
sequences to date was performed by Eisen et al. in 1995
(20). Although it has subsequently been revisited within
the context of various biochemical studies (21–24), no
broad survey has been conducted for over a decade.
To gain new insights into the Snf2 family, we have
catalogued Snf2 family members by scanning for proteins
containing spans with similarity in sequence over the
helicase-like region, classifying them into subfamilies,
analysing the distribution of these subfamilies in complete
genomes, and mapping the common sequence characteristics
onto the newly available three-dimensional structures. We
have identified 24 distinct subfamilies, 11 with near ubiqui-
tous representation in eukaryotic genomes. Many of these
subfamilies correlate with known biological function, but
there remain a significant number for which little information
is currently available. The abundance of Snf2 family members
in eukaryotes in comparison to archaea and eubacteria points
to their diversification early in eukaryote radiation. This
diversity and the currently known functional linkages suggest
the Snf2 family helicase-like region is specifically adapted to
perform distinct functions within different subfamilies.
Underlying this, analysis of the conserved blocks of res-
idues reveals a common core of structural features likely to
be fundamental to the mechanism of the Snf2 family motors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data and software sources
Swissprot/Uniprot (25) release 42 and Uniref100 (26)
release 5 were downloaded from the European Bioinformat-
ics Institute (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/swissprot/ and
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/, respectively). The
sources and version details for the predicted protein comple-
ments of the 54 eukaryotic, 24 archaeal and 269 prokaryotic
organisms surveyed are available at the webserver http://
www.snf2.net/. Analyses were performed on a cluster of
dual Pentium III microcomputers running a customized
Debian Linux operating system.
Sequence data were manipulated with the EMBOSS suite
version 2.8 (27). Multiple sequence alignments were created
with Muscle version 3.0 (28) and MAFFT version 5.667 with
parameters retree ¼ 2 and maxiterate ¼ 1000 (29) and visu-
alized with Jalview version 2 (30). Phylogenetic and pairwise
trees were constructed with neighbor, protdist and drawtree
from the PHYLIP suite version 3.572 (31) and additionally
visualized with ATV version 2.03 (32) and Hypertree version
1.0.0 (33). Hidden Markov model (HMM) construction,
calibration and searching was performed with the HMMer
suite versions 2.1.1 and 2.2g (34), and pairwise comparison
of HMMs carried out with PRC version 1.5.3 in global-global
mode (35). Sequence LOGOs were generated with WebLogo
version 2.8.2 (36) and profile logos generated with logomat-p
using the draw_logo method, version 0.71 (37). Protein struc-
tures were visualized with PyMol version 0.99 (38). Data
were managed using mySQL (http://www.mysql.com) and
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) relational databases.
Calculations were carried out using default parameters except
where indicated. All other analyses used custom Perl or
Python scripts written by the authors. All supplementary
data for this report and an interactive database of the results
are publicly available at the web server http://www.snf2.net/.
Experimental methods
A full technical description of the library construction and
validation and details of the web server will be available
elsewhere (D.M.A. Martin and A. Flaus, manuscript in pre-
paration). The procedure used is summarized in outline below.
Global Snf2 family HMM construction
Twenty-eight biochemically characterized S.cerevisiae
Snf2p-like chromatin remodelling proteins or close homo-
logues were selected as seed sequences. The core helicase-
like region spanning from 50 amino acids N-terminal to
helicase motif I to 50 amino acids C-terminal of helicase
motif VI was excised from each protein sequence and multi-
ple alignments were created with Muscle using default
parameters. An initial seed HMM was constructed following
manual assessment of the alignment.
Swissprot 42 was searched using this profile, expanding the
set of Snf2 family sequences to 620 candidates with matches
up to E-values of 2 although some matches near this cut-off
were helicase-like sequences which were not members of
the Snf2 family. Further iterations of HMM construction
and searching of Swissprot 42 and model organism databases,
followed by curation of sequences to remove fragmented
sequences and other artefacts not belonging to the Snf2 fam-
ily, yielded a set of 948 manually curated sequences which
were then aligned by MAFFT.
The resultant profile was employed in searching Uniref100
and identified 5046 sequences with a match of E-value 10
or better of which 3932 had E-values below 1 and 1879
had positive bit-scores. This cut-off may appear generous
but was intentional to enable maximum possible inclusion
of Snf2 family members. It is predicated by the considerable
variation in sequence between helicase motifs III and IV
giving rise to poor alignments to the general model in this
region and consequently lower bit scores. The cut-offs
selected were determined by manual inspection of the hit
lists and alignments to include established Snf2 family-like
proteins but exclude more distant relatives. The highest
E-value for a sequence classified into a subfamily (see
below) was 2.2 · 1016.
Phylogenetic analysis of helicase-like sequences
A multiple sequence alignment with Muscle, followed by
distance matrix calculation and neighbour-joining tree recon-
struction allowed the curation of 2305 sequences into sub-
groupings in the Snf2 family based on the sequence of the
helicase-like region. 1306 sequences were classified in
24 individual subfamilies within the Snf2 family (Table 1)
after the exclusion of 436 which were fragmentary (did not
span completely from helicase motifs I to VI) or contained
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 10 2889
unique large inserts or deletions. A further 220 were assigned
to the prokaryotic rapA group and the remainder to more dis-
tantly related clusters or as highly truncated outliers which
could not be reasonably aligned. An overview of a neighbour-
joining tree constructed from a multiple alignment excluding
the variable minor and major insertion regions (see text) and
visualized using Hypertree demonstrates the clearly distin-
guishable division of subfamilies (Figure 1B). Each subfam-
ily was individually examined for redundancy and further
internal structure (data not shown).
Construction and use of subfamily profiles
Each subfamily sequence set was realigned by MAFFT,
manually curated with Jalview and an HMM profile con-
structed. These profiles were aligned with PRC in an all-
against-all comparison. Although these profile comparisons
do not give a true phylogenetic tree, the scores obtained
from the pairwise profile alignments can be used to construct
a representational tree (Figure 1C), indicating the relationship
between the HMM profiles to be consistent with the
sequence-based tree (Figure 1B). It was also observed that
the subfamilies could be aggregated into some broad group-
ings that correlate with functional properties, where known
(Figure 1).
All 24 subfamily profiles were combined in one HMM
library and the hmmpfam application employed in searching
individual genomic datasets to provide phylogenomic infor-
mation about the taxonomic distribution of Snf2-like proteins.
The subfamily hit with maximal bitscore >100 was used
to assign membership in a semi-automatic procedure. With
very few exceptions, classification was extremely clear with
strong discrimination between the top hit and the second
best hit (data not shown).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Starting from a seed set of helicase-like region sequences
from 28 demonstrated Snf2p-related proteins or close homo-
logues, we have carried out a broad survey of Snf2 family
proteins. This was achieved by iterative cycles of manual
curation of multiple alignments and neighbour-joining trees
to identify Snf2 proteins by similarity, construction of an
HMM profile from the multiple alignments of identified pro-
teins, and scanning of global and model organism protein
databases using the HMM profile to uncover further
sequences for curation. Our current global Snf2 family profile
scan revealed 3932 sequences with E-value under 1 (1879
with bitscore > 0) in Uniref100 release 5 [2.4 million entries
(26)]. Of these, 1306 sequences were identified as belonging
to the Snf2 family and to span the full helicase region from
motifs I to VI without introducing large unique insertions
or deletions. A further 220 sequences fall within the rapA
group, while other hits appear to belong to more distantly
related groups (see below) or were too highly truncated to
be aligned. Neighbour-joining trees from multiple alignments
of the set of 1306 sequences revealed a well-defined branch-
ing structure (Figure 1B) and enabled their assignment to
24 distinct subfamilies (Table 1).
Subfamily-specific HMM profiles were constructed
from these assignments and used to characterize the Snf2

counts of predicted proteins and unique encoding genes for
21 selected genomes are listed in Table 2, part A and B,
respectively (see Supplementary Table S1A for full analysis
of eukaryotic genomes, and Supplementary Table S2
for gene IDs by subfamily for seven common model
organisms). In addition, 24 complete archaeal and 269
bacterial genomes were scanned (Supplementary Tables
S1B and S1C).
Subfamilies within the Snf2 family
The clear distinction and significant number of subfamilies
based on the helicase-like region (Figure 1B and Table 1)
reflects both a remarkable breadth and specificity in the
Snf2 family. An additional level of similarity distinguishes
apparent groupings of subfamilies (Figure 1), which echo cur-
rent understanding of their functional diversity (Table 3).
Most of the best studied Snf2 family proteins fall into a
grouping of ‘Snf2-like’ subfamilies including proteins such
as S.cerevisiae Snf2p, D.melanogaster Iswi, mouse Chd1
and human Mi-2, which are core subunits of the well-known
ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes. A sepa-
rate ‘Swr1-like’ grouping encompasses the Swr1, Ino80,
EP400 and Etl1 subfamilies. The ‘Rad54-like’ grouping con-
tains the Rad54 subfamily, relatives such as ATRX and
Arip4, and also includes the recently recognized DRD1 and
JBP2 proteins. A further, unexpected, ‘Rad5/16-like’ group-
ing links several poorly studied subfamilies, three of which
contain RING finger insertions within the helicase-like region
(see below). The ‘SSO1653-like’ grouping of Mot1, ERCC6
and SSO1653 is notable because all three subfamilies are
thought to have non-chromatin substrates. Finally, we have
labelled SMARCAL1 proteins as ‘distant’ because they lack
several otherwise conserved sequence hallmarks of the Snf2
family (see below). Although some groupings are clear, fur-
ther investigations will be required to verify those where the
boundaries are less distinct.
Since the subfamily assignments are based only on the
common helicase-like region, this suggests that the ‘motor’
at the core of even large multiprotein remodeller complexes
is tuned to the mechanistic requirements of its function.
Such properties are not unprecedented for motor protein
subfamilies. The ubiquitous kinesin and myosin proteins are
divided into at least 14 and 17 subfamilies, respectively
(39,40), and those subfamilies are recognized to reflect tuning
of the motors for enzymatic properties linked to particular
functional roles. As this also appears to be true for Snf2 fam-
ily proteins we can anticipate that mechanistic features of the
motors will be shared within subfamilies and groupings. This
may be useful in helping to predict function of poorly charac-
terized proteins. For example, owing to the recent observation
that Swr1 functions in histone exchange (41–43), it is tempt-
ing to speculate that the Snf2 motors within other subfamilies
in the Swr1-like grouping may be adapted for related
purposes.
Owing to the remarkable diversity revealed by this
classification and the occurrence of many subfamilies which
have not been intensively investigated, we briefly summarize
current functional and biochemical understanding and charac-
teristic features of each subfamily in Table 3.
Defining the Snf2 family
The survey of Snf2 family proteins enables detailed analysis
of sequence conservation in the helicase-like region
(Figure 2). This reveals a number of unique features distin-
guishing them from other helicase superfamily SF2 members.
First, the conserved helicase motifs show a highly conserved
character across the Snf2 family, and some motifs are exten-
ded by juxtaposed residues such as conserved blocks E and G
(Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S4). Second, the
helicase-like region in the Snf2 family is significantly longer
than for many other helicases, primarily due to an increased
spacing between motifs III and IV of >160 residues compared
to 38 and 78 for typical SF2 helicases NS3 and RecG, respec-
tively (44). Third, a number of unique conserved blocks are
found in Snf2 family proteins (Figure 2 and Supplementary
Table S5). Several of these blocks have been noted pre-
viously (20,45–48), with conserved block B having been con-
fused in a number of early manuscripts with motif IV.
Conserved blocks B, C and K are of particular interest
because they are located within the characteristic extended
inter-motif III–IV region (Figure 3G).
The SMARCAL1 subfamily contains classical helicase
motifs which are highly similar to the other subfamilies. It
also has an extended motif III–IV spacing, but it nevertheless
lack conserved blocks within the motif III–IV region (Supple-
mentary Figure S4). The rapA group has similar properties
but is more diverse in overall sequence and retains less
similarity in the classical motifs. It is unclear whether the
SMARCAL1 subfamily and particularly the rapA group
will maintain the structural features of the Snf2 family and
they are therefore at the limit of the definition of the Snf2
family. We have also noticed further protein groupings with
extended spacing between motifs III and IV and detectable
similarity to the classical helicase-like motifs of the Snf2
family sequences (Supplementary Figure S4). These include
poxvirus NPH-I related proteins involved in transcription
termination (49) and the FANCM/MPH1/Hef group of heli-
cases encompassing yeast Mph1p, archaeal Hef and human
FANCM proteins involved in DNA repair (50–52). However,
those proteins show low similarity to the Snf2 family between
motifs III and IV and appear to lack the characteristic con-
served blocks C, J and K of the Snf2 family. Interestingly,
comparison of the recently determined Pyrococcus furiosus
archaeal Hef helicase structure reveals that the MPH1/Hef
group has a related structural organization to Zebrafish
Rad54, but contains only a single compact alpha-helical
domain encoded between motifs III and IV (Supplementary
Figure S6). It has been noted that this extra alpha-helical
domain has some similarities with the thumb domain of
Taq DNA polymerase which grips the DNA minor groove
(53). It is therefore likely that the SMARCAL1 subfamily,
rapA group, NPH-I and MPH1/Hef proteins reflect a contin-
uum of diversity while sharing core features with the other
Snf2 subfamilies.
Evolution of Snf2 family diversity
None of the 293 scanned archaeal or bacterial genomes con-
tains a protein classified in any of the eukaryotic subfamilies
(Supplementary Tables S1B and S1C). All identified archaeal
and bacterial proteins belong to the SSO1653 subfamily and
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 10 2891
rapA group. Conversely, the SSO1653 subfamily and
rapA group are likely to be specific to microbial organisms
because the only two members of these families identified
in eukaryotes (Supplementary Table S1A) appear to be
false positives (data not shown). Over two-thirds of complete
microbial genomes contain members of the SSO1653
subfamily and/or rapA group. This broad yet incomplete
distribution suggests they perform non-essential functions
that are sufficiently advantageous to maintain their
prevalence.

Table 3. Functional and sequence characteristics of subfamilies
Grouping Subfamily Functional characteristics
Snf2-like Snf2 The archetype of the Snf2 subfamily, and the entire Snf2 family, is the S.cerevisiae Snf2 protein, originally identified genetically
(mutations that were Sucrose Non Fermenting or defective in mating type SWItching). However, these genes were later found to
play roles in regulating transcription of a broader spectrum of genes and to catalyse alterations to chromatin structure.
Subsequently, the proteins were purified as a non-essential 11 subunit multi-protein complex capable of ATP-dependent chromatin
disruption termed the SWI/SNF complex (8)
Close sequence homologues have also been identified in many model organisms, including the paralogue RSC (60,61) and the
orthologues D.melanogaster Brahma (62), and human hBRM (63) and BRG1 (64). Many of these have been shown to alter the
structure of chromatin at the nucleosomal level and to be involved in transcription regulation, although other nucleosome-related
roles have also been identified (8). Recent hypotheses have centred on Snf2 subfamily members performing a generally disruptive
function on nucleosomes leading either to sliding of the nucleosome (65,66) alterations of histone DNA contacts (67) or to partial or
complete removal of the histone octamer components (68,69)
Homologues such as BRG1 and hBRM are components of megadalton-sized complexes containing other proteins that are also related
to components of the yeast SWI/SNF complex (70). However, Snf2 subfamily members have also been reported to interact with
additional proteins including histone deacetylases (71), methyl DNA-binding proteins (72), histone methyl transferases (73), the
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (74,75), histone chaperones (76), Pol II (77,78) and cohesin (79). These complexes may be
recruited to specific regions of the genome through interactions with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins [reviewed by (80)]
or specific patterns of histone modifications (81,82)
ISWI Iswi (Imitation SWI2) protein was identified in D.melanogaster by similarity to Snf2p (83) and is at the catalytic core of both the
NURF and the ACF/CHRAC chromatin remodelling complexes (84–86). Biochemical studies favour the ability of Iswi proteins to
reposition rather than disrupt nucleosomes. Significantly, all Iswi subfamily proteins require a particular region of the histone H4
tail near the DNA surface as an allosteric effector (87–89)
Iswi subfamily members participate in a variety of complexes and functional interactions. For example, human SNF2H has been
found as part of RSF, hACF/WCRF, hWICH, hCHRAC, NoRC and also associated with cohesin, while SNF2L is the catalytic
subunit of human NURF [summarized in (90)]. Such complexes are involved in a variety of functions including activation/
repression of the initiation and elongation of transcription, replication and chromatin assembly [reviewed in (90–93)]. Similar to the
Snf2 subfamily, Iswi subfamily members appear to be adaptable subunits for complexes related to the alteration of nucleosome
positioning (90)
Lsh Despite its name, the archetypal mouse Lsh (lymphoid-specific helicase) protein (94) is widely expressed and without detectable
helicase activity. Lsh and its human homologue are alternatively known as PASG, SMARCA6 or by the official gene name HELLS
(Helicase Lymphoid Specific). Mutants lead to premature aging with cells exhibiting replicative senescence (95). Importantly,
global loss of CpG methylation is observed in both mammalian mutant cell lines and the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue, DDM1
(96,97). Consistent with a direct role in DNA methylation, Lsh is localized to heterochromatic regions (98). Evidence has been
presented that A.thaliana DDM1 can slide nucleosomes in vitro (99). The S.cerevisiae subfamily member at locus YFR038W has
no assigned name and deletion strains are viable
Lsh subfamily members are detected over a very broad range of eukaryotes including not only fungi, plants and animals, but also
protists where their function is likely to be independent of DNA methylation. Furthermore, our genome scans also did not identify
Lsh subfamily members in a number of lower animals, or in S.pombe. This may represent functional redundancy or difficulties in
assigning distant homologues relative to other subfamilies in the grouping
ALC1 The ALC1 subfamily derives its name from the observation that the human gene is ‘Amplified in Liver Cancer’ (100). Two alternative
but potentially confusing names, CHD1L [CHD1-like (101)] and SNF2P [SNF2-like in plants (102)], have also been used to refer to
subfamily members. ALC1 subfamily members contain a helicase-like region which is relatively similar to the nucleosome-active
Snf2, Iswi and Chd1 subfamilies, but which is coupled ahead to a macro domain implicated in ADP–ribose interactions (103).
ALC1 subfamily members can be identified in both higher animals and plants, but not in lower animals
Chd1 The archetypal ‘Chd’ protein is mouse Chd1, named after the presence of ‘Chromodomain, Helicase and DNA binding’ motifs (104).
The characteristic chromodomain motifs can in principle bind diverse targets including proteins, DNA and RNA (105). Although
Snf2 family proteins containing chromodomains are often referred to as a single ‘Chd’ subfamily, it has previously been recognized
they fall into the same three distinct subfamilies (106,107) which we have distinguished in this analysis
Mouse Chd1 protein is the archetype of the first chromodomain-containing subfamily. Chd1 proteins have been purified as single
subunits (108,109) although associations between Chd1 and other proteins have been identified subsequently (110,111). Yeast
Chd1 has been implicated in transcription elongation and termination (58,112), and the human CHD1 and CHD2 proteins and
D.melanogaster dChd1 have been linked to transcriptional events (113). S.pombe Chd1 subfamily member hrp1 (helicase related
protein 1) has been linked with both transcription termination (58) and chromosome condensation (114), whereas the paralogous
hrp3 has been linked with locus-specific silencing (115)
Mi-2 The second of the chromodomain-containing subfamilies is Mi-2, whose name derives from the Mi-2a and Mi-2b proteins which are
the commonly used names for the human CHD3 and CHD4 gene products, respectively. Mi-2 was isolated as an autoantigen in the
human disease dermatomyositis (116). Subsequently, the two proteins and their homologues in D.melanogaster and Xenopus have
been recognized as core subunits of NuRD complexes which link DNA methylation to chromatin remodelling and deacetylation
(117). The chromodomains in D.melanogaster Mi-2 are required for activity on nucleosome substrates (118). Human Mi-2a differs
from Mi-2b principally by its additional C-terminal domain which directs complexes containing it for a specific transcriptional
repression role (119). Since Mi-2 proteins are widely expressed but have specific roles, it has been suggested they may be directed
by incorporation of different targeting subunits (117,120)
An additional human member of the Mi-2 subfamily, CHD5, may have a role in neural development and neuroblastomas (121,122)
although its biochemical associations are unknown. The A.thaliana subfamily member, PKL (swollen roots of mutants resemble a
pickle), has been shown to play a role in repressing embryonic genes during plant development (123)
CHD7 The third chromodomain-containing CHD7 subfamily includes four human genes, CHD6–CHD9. CHD7 has recently been linked to
CHARGE syndrome which is a common cause of congenital abnormalities (124) with most linked mutations resulting in major
nonsense, frameshift or splicing changes (125). There is little functional information available about CHD6 [originally known as
CHD5 (126)], CHD8 or CHD9 [also known as CReMM (127)]. The most studied member of the CHD7 subfamily is the product of
the D.melanogaster gene kismet. The enormous 574 kDa KIS-L (but not the ‘smaller’ 225 kDa KIS-S form) contains a Snf2 family
helicase-like region (128). Although identified as a trithorax family gene acting during development, a recent report suggests that
KIS-L may play a global role at an early stage in RNA pol II elongation (129)
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 10 2893
Table 3. Continued
Grouping Subfamily Functional characteristics
Swr1-like Swr1 The archetype of the Swr1 subfamily is Swr1p (SWI/SNF-related protein) from S.cerevisiae which is part of the large SWR1 complex
that exchanges histone H2A.Z-containing for wild-type H2A-containing dimers (41–43,130). Three other characterized proteins
belong to the subfamily: PIE1 is involved in the A.thaliana vernalization regulation [Photoperiod-Independent Early flowering
(131)] through a pathway intimately linked with histone lysine methylation events (132). D.melanogaster Domino is an essential,
development-linked protein (133) and alleles can suppress position effect variegation, implying they may be linked to
heterochromatin functions. Domino participates in a complex that combines components of the homologous yeast SWR1 and
NuA4 complexes (134), and has been shown to function in acetylation dependent histone variant exchange within the TRRAP/
TIP60 complex (135). The human member SRCAP [Snf2p-related CBP activating protein (136)] acts as a transcriptional
co-activator of steroid hormone dependent genes and has recently been shown to be a component of a human TRRAP/TIP60
complex (137) and other complexes (see EP400 below). It also interacts with several coactivators including CBP (136,138).
SRCAP can rescue D.melanogaster domino mutants (139), implying functional homology
EP400 The EP400 subfamily archetype, E1A-binding protein p400, appears to have a role in regulation of E1A-activated genes (140–142).
EP400 has been shown to interact strongly with ruvB-like helicases TAP54a/b in the TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyl transferase
complex (142)
The complex patterns of similarities and distinctions between EP400 and Swr1 subfamilies suggest a close functional relationship
(Supplementary Figure S3A). Our HMM profiles clearly distinguish EP400 from Swr1 members, and show that EP400 members
are restricted to vertebrates whereas Swr1 subfamily members are found in almost all eukaryotes (Table 2 and Supplementary
Table S1A). Although most vertebrate genomes contain a gene each for an Swr1 and EP400 member, some have only one of the
pair. The consensus for the helicase-like regions of the subfamilies shows 50% identity and animal members of both contain large
proline and serine/threonine rich insertions at the major insertion site (Supplementary Figure S3A; see below). Members of the two
subfamilies also contain overlapping combinations of accessory domains outside the helicase-like region: D.melanogaster
DominoA (Swr1 subfamily) and human EP400 (EP400 subfamily) both contain SANT domains, whereas human SRCAP (Swr1
subfamily) instead contains an AT hook (139). This has led to some confusion, with human EP400 being referred to as hDomino
although D.melanogaster Domino has higher similarity to human SRCAP (142) and SRCAP can complement Domino mutants
(139). In addition to the complexity in primary sequence relationships, complexes of potentially overlapping composition exist
involving human EP400 and SRCAP including the NCoR-1 histone deacetylase (143), TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetylase
(137,142,144) and DMAP1 complex (145). The confusing overlap of the mammalian Swr1 and EP400 subfamily members may
stem from multiple roles for Swr1 subfamily members in lower animals and fungi. For example, it has been suggested that
D.melanogaster alternative splice isoforms DominoA and DominoB are functional homologues of EP400 and SRCAP,
respectively (139), and that S.cerevisiae Eaf1p is a functional homologue of human EP400 (134) although it lacks both Snf2-related
helicase-like and extended proline-rich regions
Ino80 The archetype of the Ino80 subfamily is the Ino80 protein from S.cerevisiae. Further members have been identified by sequence
similarity in fungi, plants and animals (24). Ino80p was first isolated through its role in transcriptional regulation of inositol
biosynthesis (146,147) and forms part of the large Ino80.com complex (148). This complex is notable not only because it can
reposition nucleosomes, but also because it is the only known Snf2 family-related complex able to separate DNA strands in a
traditional helicase assay (148). However, the Ino80 complex contains two RuvB-like helicase subunits which may assist in this.
The human INO80 complex has recently been shown to contain many proteins homologous to Ino80.com subunits, including the
RuvB-like helicases, and to be capable of mobilizing mononucleosomes (149). S.cerevisiae INO80-deleted strains are sensitive to
DNA damaging agents, and recent studies have implicated Ino80p directly in the events of double-stranded break repair (150,151),
perhaps for the eviction of nucleosomes in the vicinity of the break (152) although other remodelling complexes such as Swr1, RSC
and SWI/SNF may also participate in this repair pathway [reviewed in (153)]
Etl1 Mouse Etl1 (Enhancer Trap Locus 1) derives its name from identification in an expression screen for loci having interesting properties
in early development (154). Although members are present in all but the lowest eukaryotes, including the human homologue
SMARCAD1 (SMARCA containing DEAD box 1) (155) and S.cerevisiae FUN30 (Function Unknown 30) (156), very little
attention has been focussed on these proteins. Etl1 is very widely expressed but non-essential, although deletion causes a variety of
significant developmental phenotypes (157). FUN30 deletions are viable although temperature sensitive (158), and mutants show
decreased sensitivity to UV radiation (159)
Rad54-like Rad54 The archetype of the Rad54 subfamily is the Rad54 protein from S.cerevisiae which was isolated because its inactivation leads to
increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Rad54p and its homologues in other organisms play an important but as yet incompletely
understood role in homologous recombination by stimulating Rad51-mediated single strand invasion into the target duplex, and
subsequent steps in the process (160,161). Many organisms also contain a second subfamily member, such as S.cerevisiae Rdh54p
or S.pombe tid1p. These are frequently implicated in mitotic repair and meiotic crossover (162), although the role of the human
homologue RAD54B is unclear (163)
Rad54 proteins have been extensively studied in vitro. They have been shown to be able to generate local changes in DNA topology in
supercoiled plasmids (13,164,165), to translocate along DNA by biochemical (11) and other methods, and to alter the accessibility
of nucleosomal DNA (11,166,167). However, this latter activity appears inefficient compared to purified complexes from the Snf2
and Iswi subfamilies. The crystal structure of the zebrafish Rad54 helicase-like region has been determined recently (47) and is
discussed in more detail in the text
ATRX The ATRX subfamily derives its name from the Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation syndrome, X-linked genetic disorder caused
by defects in the activity of the human member, ATRX (168). This protein is localized to centromeric heterochromatin (169), and
purified complexes have been shown to increase the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA although with only moderate efficiency
(12). ATRX has been implicated both in the regulation of transcription and heterochromatin structure (170), although the
mechanism by which it acts is unclear
Arip4 Mouse androgen receptor interacting protein 4 (171) can bind to DNA and generate ATP-dependent local torsion (16). Although it can
also bind nucleosomes, Arip4 does not appear to be able to alter their nuclease sensitivity, leading to the conclusion that nucleosome
mobilization may not be its primary role (172). Interestingly, mutation of the six lysine sumoylation sites in the protein destroyed
DNA binding and ATPase activity (172)
DRD1 A.thaliana DRD1 is named from its phenotype ‘Defective in RNA-directed DNA methylation’ (173). DRD1 functions together with
an atypical RNA polymerase IV to establish and also remove non-CpG DNA methylation as part of an RNA interference mediated
pathway (174,175)
JBP2 The JBP2 subfamily takes its name from the T.brucei J Binding Protein 2 which regulates insertion of an unusual glycosylated
thymine-derived base, J, which marks silenced telomeric DNA (176)
2894 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 10
Table 3. Continued
Grouping Subfamily Functional characteristics
Rad54-like
(cont.)
Both DRD1 and JBP2 are involved in processes which target modifications at the C5 position of the pyrimidine ring which will be
exposed in the major groove. JBP2 and DRD1 members show sequence similarity, but have been conservatively assigned to
separate subfamilies due to their distinct evolutionary ranges and the limited numbers of members available for building HMM
profiles. The identification of a DRD1 subfamily member in Dictyostelium suggests that the subfamilies may be more widespread
than indicated by the current small sample set. The L.major, T.brucei and T.cruzi genomes with JBP2 subfamily members also
contain proteins assigned to the Arip4 subfamily whose members are otherwise found in higher fungi and animals, but not in
DRD1-containing plants. It is possible that a relationship encompasses not only DRD1 and JBP2, but also Arip4
Rad5/16-like Rad5/16 S.cerevisiae Rad5 and Rad16 proteins are distinct but dual archetypes for this subfamily and both are intimately involved in DNA
repair pathways
Rad5p acts with the Ubc13p–Mms2p E2 ligase complex via its RING finger in one fate of the Rad6 pathway of replication linked
DNA damage bypass to poly-ubiquitylate PCNA in (177). It has also been suggested that Rad5p participates in double-stranded
break repair in a role dependent on its helicase-like region but not its RING finger (178). A clear function for the helicase-like motor
in either role has not been suggested
Rad16p acts in complex with Rad7p and Elc1p as the NEF4 nucleotide excision repair factor (179,180), possibly scanning along
chromatin for lesions as part of non-transcribed strand repair (179) or by distorting DNA to expose the lesion for processing (17).
Although the basis is not known, the RING finger of Rad16p influences the stability of the Rad4 protein responsible for recognizing
the lesion (180)
Paradoxically, no DNA repair link has been reported for the single member of the Rad5/16 subfamily present in each mammalian
genome such as human SMARCA3 (see also Lodestar and ERCC6 sections of this table). Instead, under the name
RUSH1alpha, some have been reported as steroid regulated transcriptional regulators (181) and, under the name HLTF, to be
silenced in cancers (182)
Ris1 The Ris1 protein from S.cerevisiae interacts with Sir4p and has a role in mating type silencing (183) Members are found in all fungi
and plant genomes, but not in animals or lower eukaryotes
Lodestar This subfamily is the only one within the Rad5/16 grouping which does not contain RING fingers in the major insertion site
(Figure S3B). D.melanogaster Lodestar protein was first identified as an essential cell-cycle regulated protein localizing to
chromosomes during mitosis (184). Subsequently, the human homologue TTF2 was shown to terminate elongating RNA pol I and
pol II complexes independently of transcript length, possibly by directly clearing Pol II from the template at the entry to mitosis
(185). TTF2 may also have a role in interphase termination, and in repair (185). This suggestion is interesting because no clear
functional homologue of S.cerevisiae Rad5p has been identified in the higher eukaryote genomes which Lodestar is restricted to
(see also ERCC6 section of this table). TTF2 has been observed to rescue RNA polymerases stalled at lesions (186)
SHPRH SHPRH proteins derive their name from the ordered sequence of domains Snf2_N, Linker_Histone (i.e. H1), PHD finger, Zf_C3HC4
(i.e. e RING finger), Helicase_C in the human member (187) (Supplementary Figure S3B). The Linker_Histone and PHD finger
motifs are located adjacent to each other at the minor insertion site between motifs I and Ia, whereas the RING finger domain is
located at the major insertion site. The linker histone-related domain in human SHPRH corresponds to the globular winged helix
structure of histone H1 (188) and transcription factor HNF3 (189,190). The PHD finger motifs are specialized zinc finger structures
which occur in a range of proteins involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation but whose exact function is unclear
(191,192)
Fungal SHPRH subfamily members typically do not contain the linker histone-related motif, although they do contain the PHD and
RING finger domains. Animal SHPRH members contain an additional 50 kDa polypeptide sequence immediately upstream of
the RING finger domain within the major insertion region (Supplementary Figure S3B). Although lacking an identifiable motif, this
region has a number of cysteines suggestive of a zinc finger type coordination and has some 30% charged residues. Fungal members
also contain a significant region of charged residues ahead of the RING finger
SSO1653-like Mot1 S.cerevisiae Mot1 protein (Modifier of Transcription) (193) and homologues with highly conserved helicase-like regions are present
across fungi and all higher eukaryotes, where they are known as BTAF1 or TAF172 (194). In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that
Mot1p interacts intimately with TBP (195), probably acting to recycle it from DNA-bound states (196). Mot1p is therefore thought
to be a Snf2 family enzyme whose role is not to manipulate nucleosome structure, although a possible direct involvement with
chromatin has also been proposed (197)
ERCC6 Human ERCC6 protein (198), also known as Cockayne Syndrome B (CSB), and S.cerevisiae homologue Rad26p (199) were initially
regarded as repair proteins due to effects on transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair. However, it has more recently been
suggested that the function of these proteins may be to assist transcribing RNA polymerases to either pass or dissociate from
blocking DNA lesions (200). Such a role would not directly involve chromatin. The consequent barriers to transcription elongation
and sensitivity to DNA damage for non-functional mutants would explain features of Cockayne syndrome and is analogous to the
role of the non-Snf2 family Mfd DNA translocase from Escherichia coli (201)
Most higher animal genomes contain three separate genes assigned to the ERCC6 subfamily, along with single Lodestar and Rad5/16
subfamily members. Conversely, fungal genomes typically encode a single ERCC6 member, no Lodestar subfamily member, but
at least two Rad5/16 members. This may reflect divergent strategies for accomplishing transcription-coupled repair
A number of mutations in the helicase region which result in Cockayne syndrome have been identified and these map to interesting
locations in the Snf2 family crystal structures (46,198). In vitro, purified ERCC6 protein can alter nuclease sensitivity and spacing
of nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner (202). ERCC6 can also bind and negatively supercoil DNA in the presence of
non-hydrolysable ATP analogues (203)
SSO1653 SSO1653, the sole Snf2 family member in archaeal S.solfataricus, is the archetype for the uniquely archaeal and eubacterial subfamily
most similar to the eukaryotic Snf2 proteins (see text). It is encoded in the P2 strain genome by juxtaposing SSO1653 and SSO1655
genes, which are punctuated by transposase SSO1654 inserted into the second recA domain immediately upstream of motif V.
Although it is highly unlikely that a Snf2 family enzyme would be functional with a 40 kDa transposase insertion in this conserved
part of the protein, the enzyme with transposase removed can generate DNA torsion in an ATP-dependent analogous to eukaryotic
Snf2 family proteins and was used successfully for structure determination (46). Since a full-length gene can be cloned with
appropriate screening (M. F. White, personal communication), the SSO1654 transposase must be active and we refer to the
re-fusion of SSO1653 and SSO1655 for simplicity as SSO1653. No information is available for the biological role of any member
of the subfamily, although a role in an archaeal chromatin remodelling can be excluded because S.solfataricus lacks archaeal
histone-like proteins
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 10 2895
Although rapA group proteins are distinguished by the
lack of several features characteristic of eukaryotic Snf2
family members (see above), the SSO1653 subfamily carries
all the Snf2 family sequence and structural hallmarks
(Supplementary Figure S4). SSO1653 subfamily members
are present in both bacteria and archaea, but they are not
ubiquitous in archaeal genomes despite the presence of tran-
scription, replication and repair mechanisms with significant
similarity to those of eukaryotes (54,55). There is also no
obvious linkage between the presence of histone-like proteins
and SSO1653 subfamily members in archaeal genomes
(Supplementary Table S1B). Furthermore, the SSO1653 sub-
family falls in a grouping (Figure 1C) with the eukaryotic
ERCC6 and Mot1 subfamilies whose biochemical role
appears not to involve chromatin directly. In contrast to the
limited archaeal and bacterial distribution of Snf2 family
proteins, all eukaryote genomes contain multiple Snf2 family
proteins. The early branching Giardia lamblia and the
minimal Encephalozooan cuniculi genomes both encode six
different Snf2 family genes falling into subfamilies repre-
sented across eukarya (Supplementary Table S1A), several
of which have clear linkage to chromatin transactions. It is
therefore possible that the microbial SSO1653 subfamily
represents an ancestral Snf2-like form from which the
eukaryotic subfamilies radiated. Such expansion of the Snf2
family early in eukaryote evolution (20) could have been
coincident with the development of high-density nucleosomal
packaging (56).
Distribution of Snf2 family members
in complete genomes
The linkage between the primary sequence-based definitions
of the subfamilies and distinct biological function is strongly
supported by the presence of one or more subfamily members
in each eukaryotic genome across large evolutionary ranges
(Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1A). For example, a
common set of subfamilies are found in almost all fungi,
plant and animal genomes comprising Snf2, Iswi, Chd1,
Swr1, Etl1, Mot1, Ino80, Rad5/16, ERCC6, Rad54 and
SHPRH. Increased genomic complexity is also paralleled by
increasing numbers of subfamilies and members: E.cuniculi
with a genome encoding some 2000 gene products has
6 Snf2 family members from 6 subfamilies, whereas the
S.cerevisiae genome encoding some 6000 genes has 17 Snf2
family members from 13 subfamilies, and the human genome
encoding some 25 000 genes has 32 Snf2 family genes from
20 subfamilies (Table 2, part B).
The functional linkage across large evolutionary ranges
suggests that each subfamily may have distinctive properties
of their ATPase motors tuned to their function. This is
supported by recent biochemical results demonstrating that
helicase-like regions can be swapped within but not between
subfamilies (57). However, a counterpoint is that functional
redundancy can occur between subfamilies. For example,
synthetic deletion of all three of the S.cerevisiae ISW1,
ISW2 and CHD1 genes together is required to generate a
Table 3. Continued
Grouping Subfamily Functional characteristics
SSO1653-like
(cont.)
The SSO1653 subfamily helicase-like region also shows close linkage with a zinc finger SWIM motif that may bind to nucleic acids
(204,205). For example, coordinately regulated SSO1656 immediately downstream of SSO1653–1655 encodes a 26 kDa basic
protein containing the SWIM motif. An SSO1653 subfamily member is present in all Bacillus and Streptococcus genomes (21), and
many of these polypeptides also carry a SWIM motif in the same polypeptide. Polypeptides with a Snf2 family helicase-like region
but lacking a SWIM motif appear to be in the same operon as a second smaller protein which carries the SWIM motif instead (204).
Although the SWIM motif also occurs in eukaryotes, it has not been linked to any of the eukaryotic Snf2 family proteins (204)
Distant SMARCAL1 The human SMARCAL1 (SMARCA-Like 1) protein and homologues, also known as HARP (22), are unusual within the analysis
because they include two subtypes with highly similar helicase-like regions that are flanked by completely different auxiliary
domains. The first consists of proteins in higher eukaryotes related to human SMARCAL1 itself with centrally located helicase-like
regions and one or more Harp motifs immediately N-terminal to this. Mutants in the helicase-like region of human SMARCAL1
have been linked to a genetic disorder Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (206) although the molecular function of the
SMARCAL1 protein is unknown. The bovine homologue ADAAD is stimulated by DNA single-double strand boundaries (207)
The second subtype is found in animal, plant and some protist genomes and contains SMARCAL1 subfamily members related in
overall domain organization to the human ZRANB3 protein (Zinc finger, RAN-Binding domain containing 3). The helicase region
is located at the N-terminus of the polypeptide, followed by an unusual zinc finger structure related to those found in Ran protein
binding proteins (208), and a putative HNH type endonuclease domain at the C-terminus (209). No functional information about
any proteins in this subtype is available
rapA group The rapA group includes some 220 eubacterial and archaeal members with significantly more sequence variation than other
subfamilies. Subsets of sequences are qualitatively visible within multiple alignments of the rapA group, but initial attempts to
distinguish them have been unreliable due to the variability of microbial sequences and non-homogeneous sampling in sequenced
organisms (e.g. half of all complete bacterial genomes are for a limited range of firmicute and gamma proteobacterial genera)
Although the rapA group contains the conserved sequence patterns of the Snf2 family for the classical helicase-like motifs, other
conserved blocks cannot be easily identified (Supplementary Figure S4). The characteristic extended span of at least 160 residues
between helicase motifs III and IV (44) is maintained in the rapA group, but the central part of this region diverges markedly from
the other subfamilies and lacks the highly conserved features characteristic of the Snf2 family. The specific difficulty of aligning
this region has been remarked previously (20)
The rapA group also includes a number of polypeptides for which the helicase-like region comprises effectively the entire
polypeptide, in contrast with other Snf2 family members which almost universally contain sequences outside the helicase-like
region that are likely to form accessory domains or interaction surfaces
The only member of this group for which biological function has been investigated is E.coli rapA, also known as HepA (210), which
influences polymerase recycling under high salt conditions, possibly by aiding the release of stalled polymerases (211)

strong phenotype (58,59). Redundancy also provides an
explanation why some genomes lack certain members: the
small genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacks an Iswi
subfamily member but maintains two Chd1 subfamily mem-
bers. In addition to the 11 subfamilies represented broadly
across eukaryotes are a number of others restricted to specific
taxonomic ranges. For example, CHD7 members are found
almost exclusively in animals, and ATRX members are
found only in animals and plants.
Subfamily-specific properties
A number of specific features contribute to the distinction
between subfamilies. First, the spacing between motifs III
and IV is extended significantly beyond the minimal 160
residues for a number of subfamilies (Table 4). For the
Rad5/16, Ris1 and SHPRH subfamilies, the additional
sequences all include RING fingers, whereas for the Swr1
and EP400 subfamilies they comprise highly proline and
serine/threonine-rich spans. Ino80 and ATRX subfamilies
also contain large, novel and distinct spans. Remarkably, all
these large extra insertions occur at the same location in the
primary sequence, between conserved blocks C and K which
we term the ‘major insertion site’ (Figure 3G and Supplemen-
tary Figure S7A). Even for the subfamilies without large
insertions there is variation in the length of sequence in the
major insertion site (Table 4). For example, the Zebrafish
Rad54 structure contains some 25 more residues forming
two additional small alpha helices compared to the Sulfolobus
solfataricus SSO1653 structure. When Snf2 family members
from different subfamilies are aligned, the variability of the
major insertion region strongly disturbs the alignment such
that a contiguous pattern becomes difficult to define. This
has led to some of the Snf2 family proteins being described
as having ‘split’ helicase-like ATPase regions. The disconti-
nuity is also the cause of protein motif databases such as
SMART and Pfam defining Snf2 family members as match-
ing a bipartite combination of SNF2_N and Helicase_C pro-
files (Figure 3G). The C-terminal end of the SNF2_N profile
corresponds to conserved block C.
Second, subfamilies have characteristic small insertions at
other sites (Table 4). Two such sites, also in the motif III–IV
region, are located between conserved blocks H and B and
between J and C (Figure 2). These are likely to influence
the length of the long alpha helical protrusions 1 and 2,
respectively (see below, Figure 3C), and there is a difference
of some 40 residues between the shortest and longest subfam-
ily lengths for each (Table 4). A ‘minor insertion site’ located
between motifs I and Ia on the back of recA-like domain 1 is
also occupied by recognizable domains in a few subfamilies
from the Rad5/16-like grouping such as SHPRH (Supplemen-
tary Figure S3B). A number of other small insertions map to
loops between various secondary structural elements (data
not shown).
Third, although adhering to a general Snf2 family-specific
pattern, individual subfamilies show characteristic patterns
in the helicase motifs and in other conserved blocks
(Supplementary Figure S4). For example, the well-known
helicase motif II with typical DEAH pattern favours DEGH
in the Snf2, Mot1 and Rad54 subfamilies, DEAQ in the
Swr1, EP400, Ino80 and SSO1653 subfamilies or DESH in
the SMARCAL1 subfamily. Likewise, for the typical con-
served block E—motif I combined pattern ILADEMGLGKT
all ATRX subfamily members have histidine instead of aspar-
tate (i.e. ILAHEMGLGKT) and most Mot1 subfamily mem-
bers have cysteine replacing alanine (i.e. ILCDEMGLGKT).
It is also possible to identify other residues correlating with
groups of subfamilies. For example, members of the Snf2,
Iswi, Chd1, Mi-2, CHD7, ALC1, Rad54, ATRX and Arip4
subfamilies have an arginine immediately following the
motif II DEAH. In the zebrafish Rad54 structure this residue
R294 interacts with the sulphate which is suggested to mimic
the ATP gamma phosphate.
Conserved blocks encode the unique structural
features of the Snf2 family
Two structural determinations of the helicase-like regions
of Snf2 family members have been presented recently:
zebrafish Rad54 (pdb code 1Z3I) (47) and S.solfataricus
SSO1653 (pdb codes 1Z6A, 1Z63, 1Z5Z) (46). As expected

for members of the Snf2 family, the fold of each core recA-
like domain in the Rad54 and SSO1653 structures is substan-
tially similar and related to those of other known SF1 and
SF2 helicases. In the zebrafish Rad54 structure the two recA-
like domains are oriented equivalently to those of other
known helicase structures (Figure 3A and B), whereas in
the S.solfataricus SSO1653 structures recA-like domain 2 is
flipped by 180 to an arrangement never previously observed
Figure 3. Conserved blocks contribute to distinctive structural features of Snf2 family proteins. Structural components of Snf2 family proteins relevant to the
conservation are illustrated on the zebrafish Rad54A structure [pdb 1Z3I (153)]. (A) core recA-like domains 1 and 2 including colouring of helicase motifs (I in green,

for a helicase (Supplementary Figure S7B). This unusual
orientation in SSO1653 is observed for both the DNA free
and DNA-bound forms (46).
The most striking feature of the Snf2 family structures is
the presence of several additional structural elements grafted
onto the core helicase structure. These comprise antiparallel
alpha helical protrusions from both recA-like domains
1 and 2 (Figure 3C), a structured linker between the recA-like
domains (Figure 3D), the major insertion region at the back
side of the domain 2 alpha helical protrusion (Figure 3E)
and a triangular brace packed against the domain 2 alpha
helical protrusion (Figure 3F). The two alpha-helical protru-
sions and linker are all encoded within the enlarged span
between motifs III and IV. The triangular brace is encoded
immediately downstream of motif VI.
Remarkably, the primary sequence features of the Snf2
family correspond directly to the additional structural ele-
ments (Figure 3G). First, the bases of the protrusions from
recA-like domains 1 and 2 are both fixed by conserved
blocks. For protrusion 1, this involves conserved block H
composed of a repeating pattern of aromatic residues, with
additional involvement of aromatics from conserved block
A. For protrusion 2 this involves the arrangement of con-
served blocks C, J and K. Second, the protrusions themselves
are relatively conserved in sequence and length within
subfamilies but not across the whole Snf2 family. Although
there is no obvious correlation between the lengths of the pro-
trusions 1 and 2, the distribution of protrusion lengths adheres
to multiples of the alpha helical repeat (Supplementary Figure
S8), suggesting that protrusions retain structure while varying
in extension. Third, the Q motif structure found in many SF2
proteins utilizes a different arrangement of residues to DEAD
box helicases such as eIF4A, where an aromatic residue
orients the adenine base ring for contacts with a downstream
glutamine (4) (Figures 3B). In the Snf2 family, the aromatic
residue is contributed by conserved block F downstream
of the glutamine. The Q motif affects ATP hydrolysis in
DEAD box helicases and mutation of the core glutamine in
yeast Snf2 subfamily member Sth1p causes slow growth
(4). Fourth, the linker connecting protrusions 1 and 2 contains
highly conserved dual arginines in conserved block B.
Their central location between the ATP-associating and
DNA-associating structural elements suggests that they may
play an important role in the mechanism of Snf2 family
enzymes. Consistent with this, mutation of the second argi-
nine of the pair in Snf2p leads to effectively complete loss
of function of the protein in vivo (48). Finally, the brace is
composed of a principal alpha helix anchored by conserved
block M into the junction at the base of protrusion 2 composed
of conserved blocks C, J and K.
The major insertion region is immediately behind pro-
trusion 2, almost diametrically opposite the ATP-binding
site in the zebrafish Rad54 structure (Figure 3E). The nearest
residues of the major insertion region in Rad54 are some
15 s from DNA phosphates for docked DNA (Supplementary
Figure S7A). However, an appropriately oriented alpha helix
of some 20 residues would be sufficient to reach into the
major groove, so large insertions at the major insertion site
could potentially interact with DNA or other DNA-binding
proteins bound in the groove. In the flipped conformation
of domain 2 observed in the SSO1653 structure, the major
insertion region is juxtaposed immediately adjacent to the
DNA such that two non-conserved arginines from the major
insertion region make direct DNA phosphate contacts.
As the distinctive structural features are defined by
unique and highly conserved blocks, they are likely to confer

properties to the ATPase motor that adapts the action of the
core recA-like domains for a unique mechanism. We antici-
pate that while some features of the Snf2 family mechanism
will be common to SF2 translocases, other aspects will be
distinctive. Knowledge of the conserved residues and their
structural location provides important information for under-
standing these distinctions.
Other levels of Snf2 family identity
We have demonstrated that the common helicase-like
region is sufficient to enable classification of Snf2 family
members. However, almost all Snf2 family polypeptides con-
tain significant additional sequences likely to harbour acces-
sory domains. For some subfamilies there is good correlation
with the presence of particular accessory domain combina-
tions (Supplementary Table S9). For example, almost all
Snf2 subfamily members contain a bromodomain, ISWI
members contain a SANT domain, and Chd1, Mi-2 and
CHD7 members contain a chromodomain. However, many
domain profiles in resources used for domain analysis have
unidentified function or are unreliable in the context of
Snf2 proteins. For example, Pfam lacks a SANT-specific
profile and detects <10% of SANT domains with a more gen-
eric general ‘Myb_DNA-binding’ profile. We are currently
undertaking further analysis to improve the relevant profiles
and analyse the linkage of Snf2 family accessory domains
in detail.
Finally, many Snf2 family proteins are part of larger
multi-protein complexes. Accessory motifs within these com-
plexes are also likely to adapt the function of Snf2 motors for
different purposes.
