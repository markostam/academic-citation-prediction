ABSTRACT
Steric blocking peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligonu-
cleotides have been used increasingly for redirecting
RNA splicing particularly in therapeutic applications
such as Duchennemuscular dystrophy (DMD). Cova-
lent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide helps to
improve cell delivery of PNA. We have used a HeLa
pLuc705 cell splicing redirection assay to develop a
series of PNA internalization peptides (Pip) conju-
gated to an 18-mer PNA705 model oligonucleotide
with higher activity compared to a PNA705 conjugate
with a leading cell-penetrating peptide being devel-
oped for therapeutic use, (R-Ahx-R)4. We show that
Pip–PNA705 conjugates are internalized in HeLa
cells by an energy-dependent mechanism and that
the predominant pathway of cell uptake of biologi-
cally active conjugate seems to be via clathrin-
dependent endocytosis. In a mouse model of DMD,
serum-stabilized Pip2a or Pip2b peptides conjugated
to a 20-mer PNA (PNADMD) targeting the exon 23
mutation in the dystrophin gene showed strong
exon-skipping activity in differentiated mdx mouse
myotubes in culture in the absence of an added
transfection agent at concentrations where naked
PNADMD was inactive. Injection of Pip2a-PNADMD
or Pip2b-PNADMD into the tibealis anterior muscles
of mdx mice resulted in ~3-fold higher numbers of
dystrophin-positive fibres compared to naked
PNADMD or (R-Ahx-R)4-PNADMD.
INTRODUCTION
Sequence-speciﬁc steric blocking oligonucleotides (ON)
that target intra-cellular RNAs have excellent potential
for development as therapeutic agents for a variety of
diseases (1,2). In contrast to standard antisense or
siRNA, there is no requirement for recognition of the
ON–RNA hybrid by a cellular enzyme complex (such as
RNase H or RISC) in order to achieve biological activity.
Instead, the ON is targeted at a speciﬁc RNA site to inhi-
bit or alter an essential function or protein recognition
merely by ON–RNA hybrid formation and resultant
steric interference. This approach may have higher speci-
ﬁcity than those dependent on RNA cleavage since bind-
ing at an incorrect site is less likely to trigger a biological
eﬀect. Further it allows a greater variety of ON chemistry
to be explored and hence a better opportunity to adjust
both cell delivery and pharmacology.
The steric block approach is particularly useful to inter-
fere with speciﬁc pre-mRNA processing in the cell nucleus
and hence to alter gene expression. For example, a number
of clinically relevant applications involve the redirection
of splicing, where ONs are targeted at a splice site or at
splicing regulating sequences (3). The most clinically
advanced disease target of this type is Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an X-linked muscle disorder
caused mainly by nonsense or frame-shift mutations in the
dystrophin gene, occurring with a frequency of about one
in 3500 live male births. DMD patients suﬀer from severe,
progressive muscle wasting, whereas the milder Becker
muscular dystrophy (BMD) is caused by in-frame deletions
resulting in expression of a shortened but partially func-
tional protein. ONs have been shown to induce targeted
‘exon skipping’ to correct the reading frame of mutated
dystrophin mRNA such that shorter dystrophin forms
are produced with activity similar to that of BMD (4).
Many types of ON have been investigated in a mouse
muscle cell model and also in an mdx dystrophic mouse
model, where a nonsense mutation in exon 23 is skipped to
restore dystrophin production (5–8). Initially 20-O-methyl
phosphorothioate (20OMePS) ONs were used to target the
human dystrophin gene (9,10). This backbone has been

taken to a Phase I clinical trial in Holland targeting exon
51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA in DMD patients involving
intramuscular injection with promising results in localized
dystrophin production (11). A similar Phase I trial is cur-
rently in progress in the UK involving use of a 30-mer
phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO)
(12). Studies in vivo have suggested higher levels of exon
skipping and restoration of dystrophin expression using
PMO compared to 20OMePS (8,12). PMOs are non-ionic
ONs and are less likely to form unwanted interactions
with other intra-cellular molecules of target cells. PMOs
have been used in animal models of disease and several
clinical trials to date (13). Very recently Yin et al. (14)
have demonstrated that use of a second non-ionic ON
type, known as peptide nucleic acid (PNA), also leads to
a signiﬁcant increase in the number of dystrophin-positive
ﬁbres when PNA targeted to the exon 23 mutation
was injected into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of
mdx mice, and with a higher eﬃciency than a naked
20OMePS ON.
However, a key issue in use of ONs as therapeutics has
been to achieve a suﬃcient level of intra-cellular delivery,
especially in vivo for example within diseased muscle of
DMD patients, such that the ON is in signiﬁcant excess
over the RNA target and remains so in order to achieve a
high and sustained level of biological activity. Conjuga-
tion of the ON to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)
enhances signiﬁcantly the activity of both PNA and
PMO in cellular and animal models (15–19). In the case
of PMO, an arginine-rich lead peptide has been proposed,
(R-Ahx-R)4-Ahx-b-Ala (or RXR4XB), where Ahx (X) is
aminohexanoyl. This peptide takes into account the key
roles played by Arg side chains in CPP uptake. Several
examples of enhanced activity of RXR4XB-PMO over
naked PMO have been published in both cell and
animal models (2,13), including recently in DMD studies
through intraperitoneal injection into mdx mice (20).
To assess the intra-nuclear activity levels of CPP-ON
conjugates, we have used a well-established HeLa cell
assay that involves splicing redirection of an aberrant
b-globin intron by an 18-mer synthetic ON (targeted to
the 705 site) and subsequent upregulation of ﬁreﬂy lucifer-
ase (21). This assay is straightforward and has a high
dynamic range, allowing both high- and low-activity
levels to be measured quantitatively as a positive lumines-
cence read-out. In addition the EC50 of the splicing
redirection can be assessed readily at the RNA level by
an RT-PCR assay. We showed that an RXR4XB–
PMO705 conjugate had signiﬁcant splicing redirection
activity in the luciferase upregulation model at 1 mM con-
centration (22). Similarly we showed that a RXR4–
PNA705 conjugate also had signiﬁcantly better splicing
redirection activity (23) than could be achieved with
other well-known CPPs, such as Tat, Penetratin, R9 or
K8 (24–26). We (23,26–29) and other groups (30,31)
have shown that the major barrier for nuclear delivery
of CPP–PNA, required for splicing redirection, is release
from endocytotic vesicular compartments. Indeed, poly-
cationic CPPs are internalized by an active mechanism
of endocytosis, which involves electrostatic interactions
with cellular heparan sulphates, and have little access to
the nuclear compartment (27). Thus, for many standard
CPPs conjugated to PNA, endosomolytic agents, such
as chloroquine, calcium ions or high sucrose concentra-
tion (28,32), are necessary to obtain a signiﬁcant splic-
ing redirection activity (23–26). Therefore, the key to
improving activity levels further is to search for CPPs
that can trigger enhanced endosomal release.
We described recently R6-Penetratin (R6Pen), a deriva-
tive of Penetratin in which six Arg residues were added to
the N-terminus of the CPP. Activity was observed in an
HIV-1 trans-activation inhibition assay that requires
nuclear delivery when R6Pen was disulphide-conjugated
to a PNA complementary to the trans-activation respon-
sive element RNA (28). We also showed that R6Pen dis-
ulphide or stably conjugated to PNA705 gave signiﬁcantly
better upregulation of luciferase in the splicing redirection
assay than a number of other CPP–PNA705 conjugates,
including RXR4-PNA705, at both protein and RNA
levels and showed an EC50 of 1 mM (33).
Starting with the R6Pen lead, we have now designed a
series of PNA internalization peptides (Pip) with retained
or improved activity in the HeLa cell splicing redirection
assay when conjugated to PNA705 and which are better
stabilized to serum proteolysis. We show that Pip–
PNA705 conjugates are internalized in HeLa cells by an
energy-dependent mechanism and predominantly via cla-
thrin-dependent endocytosis. Conjugates of Pip2a or
Pip2b to a 20-mer PNA targeted to the exon 23 mdx
mutation (PNADMD) showed strong exon-skipping
activity in diﬀerentiated mdx mouse myotubes and a
higher number of dystrophin-positive ﬁbres when injected
into the TA muscles of mdx mice compared to naked
PNADMD or RXR4-PNADMD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of peptide–PNA conjugates
Synthesis of PNA. N-terminal nitropyridyl (Npys)
cysteine-containing PNA705 (NH2-Cys(NPys)-Lys-CCT
CTTACCTCAGTTACA-Lys-amide) was synthesized on
an Apex 396 Synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech) or on a
Liberty microwave peptide synthesizer (CEM) by the
Fmoc/Bhoc method as previously described (28,34).
Batches of naked 20-mer PNADMD (GGCCAAAC
CTCGGCTTACCT), sense 20-mer PNA control sequence
AGGTAAGCCGAGGTTTGGCC and PNADMD for
thioether conjugation (N-a-bromoacetyl-NH-Lys-GGCC
AAACCTCGGCTTACCT-Lys-amide) were obtained
from Panagene (Korea) or synthesized in house on a
Liberty microwave peptide synthesizer. N-terminal bro-
moacetylation was carried out by the method previously
reported (35).
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out on a
Voyager DE Pro BioSpectrometry workstation with a
matrix of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 10mg ml–1
in acetonitrile/3% aqueous triﬂuoroacetic acid (1:1, v/v).
The accuracy of the mass measurement in linear mode is
regarded by the manufacturer as 0.05%, but since inter-
nal calibration was not used, the determined values varied
in a few cases from the calculated by 0.1%.

Synthesis of peptides. All peptides were prepared with free
N-terminus and C-terminal amide and also contained an
additional C-terminal cysteine residue to allow conjuga-
tion to the PNA. Peptides were synthesized on a PerSep-
tive Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesizer (100mmol
scale) using standard Fmoc/tert-butyl solid phase synth-
esis techniques as C-terminal amide peptides using Nova-
Syn TGR resin (Novabiochem). Deprotection of all
peptides and cleavage from the solid support was achieved
by treatment with triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) in the pre-
sence of triethylsilane (1%), ethane dithiol (2.5%) and
water (2.5%). Puriﬁcation was carried out by reversed
phase HPLC as previously described (36) and analysed
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with the same
matrix as for PNA.
Disulphide conjugations. These were carried out essen-
tially as previously described, usually with a 2.5-fold
excess of peptide component over NPys PNA component.
Puriﬁcation was carried out by reversed phase-HPLC as
above and analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
(28,34).
Thioether conjugations. In a typical conjugation reaction,
50 nmol bromoacetyl PNA was dissolved in 50 ml forma-
mide and 25 ml BisTris.HBr buﬀer (pH 7.5) and 12.5ml
C-terminal-Cys-containing peptide (10mM, 125 nmol,
2.5 eq.) was added. The solution was heated at 458C for
2.5 h. The resulting conjugate was puriﬁed in one injection
by reversed phase-HPLC using a Phenomenex Jupiter C18
(250 10mm; 10 micron) column, hydrochloric acid-
containing buﬀers (buﬀer A: 5mM HCl; buﬀer B: 5mM
HCl in acetonitrile/water 90/10), a ﬂow rate of 3.5ml min–1
and a gradient of 5–20% buﬀer B in 25min when conjugat-
ing to Pip peptides, or a gradient of 2 to 15% buﬀer B in
25min when conjugating to RXR4 peptide. The product
was analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
Splicing redirection assay in HeLa cells
This was carried out similarly to that described previously
(23,26). PNA or peptide–PNA conjugates were incubated
for 4 h in 1ml OptiMEM medium with exponentially
growing HeLa pLuc705 cells (1.75 105 cells/well seeded
and cultivated overnight in 24-well plates). The conjugates
were diluted with 0.5ml complete medium (DMEM plus
10% fetal bovine serum) and incubation continued for
20 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
lysed with Reporter Lysis Buﬀer (Promega, Madison,
WI). Luciferase activity was quantiﬁed with a Berthold
Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies,
Bad Wildbad, Germany) using the Luciferase Assay
System substrate (Promega, Madison, WI). Cellular pro-
tein concentrations were measured with the BCATM
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and read using
an ELISA plate reader (Dynatech MR 5000, Dynatech
Labs, Chantilly, VA) at 550 nm. Levels of luciferase
expression are shown as relative luminescence units
(RLU) per microgram protein or as fold increase in lumi-
nescence over background. All experiments were per-
formed in triplicate. Each data point was averaged over
the three replicates.
RT-PCR analysis of splicing redirection
For dose-dependence experiment, cells were treated as
described above with increasing concentrations of conju-
gates. After carrying out the luciferase assay and BCATM
Protein Assay, the remaining cell lysates (about 270 ml)
were transferred into 2-ml microfuge tubes and total
RNA was extracted with 1ml TRI Reagent (Sigma).
Minor changes to the manufacturer’s protocol were
made to accommodate the presence of Reporter Lysis
Buﬀer. Thus, 0.3ml of chloroform was used for extraction
and the amount of iso-propanol for RNA precipitation
was increased to give a 1:1 mixture with the aqueous
phase. The extracted RNA was examined by RT-PCR
(Genius Techne Thermal cycler) with forward primer
50-TTG ATA TGT GGA TTT CGA GTC GTC-30 and
reverse primer 50-TGT CAA TCA GAG TGC TTT TGG
CG-30. The products were analysed on a 2% agarose gel,
which was scanned using Gene Tools Analysis Software
(SynGene, Cambridge, UK).
Mechanism assays
For studies of energy-dependence, HeLa pLuc705 cells
were grown as usual and pre-incubated for 30min in
OptiMEM at 378C or 48C. CPP–PNA conjugates were
then added at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM and incuba-
tion was continued for 1 h. Luciferase expression was
monitored as described in the splicing redirection assay
section.
For studies of the endocytotic pathway, HeLa pLuc705
cells were grown as usual and pre-incubated for 30min in
OptiMEM at 378C in the presence of the appropriate inhi-
bitors. CPP–PNA conjugates were then added at a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mM and incubation was continued for
30min. Luciferase expression was monitored as described
in the splicing redirection assay section. Chlorpromazine
(30 mM) or K+ depletion were used to inhibit clathrin-
coated pits-mediated endocytosis; nystatin (50 mM) or
ﬁllipin-III (5 mg ml–1) were used to inhibit caveolae-
mediated endocytosis; methyl-b-cyclodextrin (mBCD)
(2.5mM) or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA)
(1mM) were used to inhibit macropinocytosis. Endo-
cytosis inhibitors were used at concentrations that did
not aﬀect signiﬁcantly cell metabolism, as judged by the
absence of eﬀect on protein synthesis levels (data not
shown).
Serum stability assay
CPP–PNA conjugates (20 mM) were incubated in PBS
containing 20% mouse serum (prepared by 3 30min
13 000 r.p.m. centrifugation at 48C of fresh clotted blood
from female Balb/c mice) at 378C. Aliquots of 10 ml were
taken at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120min and diluted with 50 ml
10% dichloroacetic acid (DCA) in H2O/CH3CN (50/50).
The samples were mixed and kept at –208C. The precipi-
tated serum proteins were separated by centrifugation
(13 000 r.p.m., 5min) and the supernatant was analysed
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Exon skipping in mousemdxmuscle cells
H2K mdx myoblasts were cultured at 338C under a 10%
CO2 atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS,
1.5% chicken embryo extract (PAA Laboratories Ltd,
Yeovil, UK), and 20U ml–1 Interferon g (Invitrogen).
Myotubes were obtained from conﬂuent H2K mdx cells
seeded in gelatin-coated 12-well plates after 3 days of
serum deprivation at 378C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere
(DMEM with 5% horse serum). The CPP–PNA conju-
gates were incubated with myotubes for 4 h in 1ml
OptiMEM and then replaced by 2ml of DMEM/5%
horse-serum media for further incubation. After 20 h myo-
tubes were washed twice with PBS and total RNA was
extracted with 1ml of TRI Reagent. RNA preparations
were treated with RNase free DNase (2 U) and Proteinase
K (20 mg) prior to RT-PCR analysis. The RT-PCR was
carried out in 25 ml with 1 mg RNA template using
SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) primed by
forward primer 50-CAG AAT TCT GCC AAT TGC
TGAG-30 and reverse primer 50-TTC TTC AGC TTG
TGT CAT CC-30. The initial cDNA synthesis was per-
formed at 558C for 30min followed by 30 cycles of
958C for 30 s, 558C for 1min and 688C for 80 s. RT
PCR product (1 ml) was then used as the template for
secondary PCR performed in 25 ml with 0.5U Super
TAQ polymerase (HT Biotechnologies) and primed by
forward primer 50-CCC AGT CTA CCA CCC TAT
CAG AGC-30 and reverse primer 50-CCT GCC TTT
AAG GCT TCC TT-30. The cycling conditions were
958C for 1min, 578C for 1min and 728C for 80 s for 25
cycles. Products were examined by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis.
For the electroporation assays, non-diﬀerentiated myo-
blast cells were seeded 2 days before the electroporation
and maintained in 20% FBS/DMEM with Interferon g at
338C in 10% CO2. Cells were treated with trypsin, counted
and centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m. for 5min, then re-sus-
pended in 0.5ml of Nucleofactor Solution V (Amaxa,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) to give 1.5 106 cells/100 ml.
100 ml of cell suspension was mixed with 0.5 nmol of
PNA or PNA–peptide conjugate and placed into an
Amaxa cuvette. After an electric pulse (program T-020)
the cell suspension was mixed with 0.5ml OptiMEM and
incubated in a microfuge tube for 10min at room tem-
perature. Cells were then transferred into a gelatin-pre-
coated 6-well plate containing 4ml of 20% FBS/
DMEM/Interferon g and incubated for 24 h at 338C
in 10% CO2. After two washes with PBS total RNA was
extracted with 1.5ml of TRI Reagent and the PCR
carried out as above.
For the cell viability assay (data not shown), myotubes
in gelatin-coated 24-well plates were incubated with CPP–
PNA conjugates for 4 h in 0.5ml OptiMEM followed
by a further 20-h incubation in 1ml of DMEM/5%
horse serum. Colorimetric MTS cell viability assay was
performed using 200 ml/well of CellTiter 96 Aqueous
One solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Each
data point was averaged over duplicates of three
experiments.
Animals and intramuscular injection
Six- to eight-week-old mdx mice were used in all experi-
ments (three mice each in the test and ﬁve in control
groups). The tibilias anterior (TA) muscle of each experi-
mental mdx mouse was injected with 5 mg of PNA or
PNA–peptide conjugate in 40 ml of saline at a ﬁnal con-
centration of 125 mg ml–1, and the contralateral muscle
was injected with saline. The experiments were carried
out in the Animal Unit, Department of Physiology,
Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford,
UK, according to procedures authorized by the UK
Home Oﬃce. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation 2
weeks after injection, and muscles were snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and stored at –808C.
Immunohistochemistry. Sections of 8 mm were cut from at
least two-thirds of the muscle length of TA at 100 mm
intervals. The sections were then examined for dystrophin
expression with a polyclonal antibody 2166 against the
dystrophin carboxyl-terminal region (the antibody was
kindly provided by Professor Kay Davies). The interven-
ing muscle sections were collected either for RT-PCR ana-
lysis and western blot or as serial sections for
immunohistochemistry. Polyclonal antibodies were
detected by goat-anti-rabbit IgGs. Alexa Fluro 594
(Molecular Probe, UK) and nuclei were counter-stained
with DAPI. Dystrophin-positive ﬁbres were counted by
ﬂuorescence microscopy using Alexa vision LE software
and presented per nanomole compound.
RNA extraction and nested RT-PCR analysis. Total
RNA was extracted from TA muscle tissue with Trizol
(Invitrogen, UK) and 800 ng of RNA template was used
for 20 ml RT-PCR with the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen,
UK). The primer sequences for the initial RT-PCR were
as shown above for muscle cell studies and were used for
ampliﬁcation of messenger RNA from exons 20 to 26. The
cycle conditions were 958C for 30 s, 558C for 1min and
728C for 2min for 25 cycles. RT-PCR product (1 ml) was
then used as the template for secondary PCR performed in
25 ml with 0.5U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, UK).
The primer sequences for the second round were the same
as shown above for muscle cell studies. The cycle condi-
tions were 958C for 1min, 578C for 1min and 728C for
2min for 25 cycles. The products were examined by elec-
trophoresis on a 2% agarose gel.
RESULTS
We chose to use the HeLa cell splicing redirection assay
(33) to monitor the activity levels of derivatives of R6Pen–
PNA705 altered in the peptide part. It is convenient to
consider the 25-mer R6Penetratin (R6Pen) peptide as com-
prising three segments (Figure 1a), an N-terminal oligo-
Arg region (segment 1), a central more hydrophobic
region (segment 2) and a C-terminal more basic region
(segment 3). R6Pen is linked to the PNA via a short
Gly–Gly spacer that is conjugated to the PNA via a redu-
cible disulphide or stable thioether linkage to the terminal
Cys residue. The resultant conjugate has an EC50 of about

1 mM in splicing redirection by RT-PCR analysis after
incubation with HeLa pLuc705 cells (33). In preliminary
studies we found that replacement of Trp by Leu in seg-
ment 2 resulted in a slight improvement in splicing redir-
ection (33). When this W!L mutation was combined with
replacement of segment 1 by (R-Ahx-R)3 (i.e. spacing of
the six Arg residues by three aminohexanoyl linkers,
shown as X in Figure 1a), the activity increased further
(37). Since three non-natural amino acids had been added,
we shortened the peptide by deletion of RQ from segment
1 and removed the GG spacer, to give the 24-mer PNA
Internalization Peptide 1 (Pip1, Figure 1a). Pip1 disul-
phide-conjugated to 18-mer CKPNA705K (PNA705)
was tested in the HeLa cell splice redirection assay for
luciferase activity (Figure 1b) and by RT-PCR analysis
(Figure 1c) for amounts of aberrant and correctly spliced
RNA. Pip1-PNA705 showed two to three times the fold
increase in luminescence compared to R6Pen–PNA705
at similar concentrations (Figure 1b). The EC50 in the
RT-PCR assay for Pip1–PNA705 was 0.50 0.05mM,
which was about 2-fold better than R6Pen–PNA
(Figure 1c) (33). RXR4–PNA705 was substantially less
active in both assays with an EC50 of splice redirection
of 3–4mM (Figure 1c). We also synthesized a conjugate
of PNA705 with (R-Ahx-R)4-Ahx-Cys (RXR4X), which
contains an additional Ahx (X) spacer, and the EC50 of
this conjugate in splice redirection was very similar to that
of RXR4-PNA705 (data not shown).
Serum stabilized Pip peptides as PNA705 conjugates
For in vivo studies, it is necessary to ensure that the pep-
tide component of the conjugate is suﬃciently stable to
serum proteolysis so that there is a better chance of the
conjugate reaching the necessary cells. We therefore devel-
oped a convenient assay based on incubation of conju-
gates with 20% mouse serum, observation of the loss of
conjugate and determination of the fragment masses of
proteolytic cleavage products by MALDI-TOF mass spec-
trometry. Although not fully quantitative, it is possible to
identify the most vulnerable proteolysis sites very easily

from the masses of the cleavage fragments. For example,
Pip1–PNA was fully cleaved within 1 h under these condi-
tions, with the major fragment observed being consistent
with cleavage between amino acids R17 and R18
(Figure 2a). Minor cleavages were observed between K11
and I12, between K22 and K23 and between K23 and C24
(data not shown). It should be noted that no cleavage was
observed within the PNA and insigniﬁcant cleavage at the
disulphide linkage occurred under these conditions. Under
the same serum incubation conditions, R6Pen–PNA705
was heavily degraded in the peptide component within a
few minutes and cleavage was also observed between the
same amino acid residues (data not shown).
A series of peptides was then synthesized iteratively
aimed at altering the sequences at the identiﬁed vulnerable
regions to increase their stability to serum proteolysis, but
without losing signiﬁcant splice redirection ability when
disulphide-conjugated to PNA705. For each peptide in
the series, the EC50 of the conjugate was measured
in the RT-PCR assay and the serum stability studied
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Supplementary
Table 1). The culmination of this study was two candidate
peptides, Pip2a ((R-Ahx-R)3IdKILFQNdRRMKWHKB
C) and Pip2b ((R-Ahx-R)3IHILFQNdRRMKWHKBC),
diﬀering only in a single amino acid in position 11
(Supplementary Table 1). Conjugates of these peptides
with PNA705 were predominantly stable for 1 h in 20%
mouse serum (Figure 2b and Supplementary Table 1).
RXR4–PNA705 was found also to be predominantly
stable under the same serum conditions as shown in
Figure 2c. In the HeLa pLuc705 cell splicing redirection
assay the EC50 for Pip2a–PNA705 was 0.79 0.13mM
and for Pip2b–PNA705 was 0.64  0.07mM (Supplemen-
tary Table 1), intermediate between that of Pip1–PNA705
and R6Pen–PNA705.
Cell uptake mechanism of Pip–PNA705 conjugates
The increased splicing redirecting activity of Pip–PNA
conjugates as compared to R6Pen–PNA705 and RXR4–
PNA705 could be due to diﬀerences in their cellular
uptake mechanism. Several publications have indeed
pointed to non-endocytotic mechanisms or macropinocy-
tosis as more favourable pathways. We ﬁrst veriﬁed that
all CPP–PNA conjugates in this series were taken up by an
energy-dependent mechanism (Figure 3a). In order to
delineate which endocytotic pathway was prevalent, two
well-characterized inhibitors of each route were used.
Chlorpromazine (30 mM) or K+ depletion were used
to inhibit clathrin-coated pits-mediated endocytosis.
Nystatin (50mM) or ﬁllipin-III (5 mg ml–1) were used to
inhibit caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Methyl-b-cyclo-
dextrin (2.5mM) or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride
(EIPA) (1mM) was used to inhibit macropinocytosis.
Since these inhibitors are not devoid of cytotoxicity,
the concentrations and the duration of pre-incubation
and of incubation were optimized to avoid any signiﬁcant
eﬀect on protein synthesis (data not shown). As shown
in Figure 3b for Pip2b–PNA705, chlorpromazine and
K+ depletion decreased luciferase expression by 90%
and 74%, respectively, in keeping with clathrin-coated Fi

pits being the major pathway of internalization. Caveolae
inhibitors such as nystatin or ﬁllipin-III had lower
inhibitory eﬀects (12% and 36%, respectively). Macropi-
nocytosis did not seem to be involved since methyl-
b-cyclodextrin increased luciferase expression while
EIPA had no eﬀect. Pip1–PNA705 and Pip2a–PNA705
showed similar results (data not shown). Pip–PNA705
conjugates thus appear to be internalized mainly through
clathrin-coated pits as already proposed for Tat–PNA (38)
and for RXR4–PNA or RXR4–PMO conjugates [(22) and
unpublished data].
Synthesis of Pip–PNA conjugates targeted to dystrophin
pre-mRNA and exon-skipping activity in culturedmdx
muscle cells
Pip1, Pip2a, Pip2b and RXR4 peptides were each conju-
gated via a stable thioether linkage to a 20-mer PNA
(PNADMD) that was shown previously to have activity
as naked PNA in exon 23 skipping in the mdx mouse by
direct muscle injection (14). These conjugates were incu-
bated for 4 h with diﬀerentiated mdx mouse myotubes at 1
or 2 mM concentrations without any other transfection
system. RNA was isolated after 20 h from the cells and
nested RT-PCR analysis was carried out to measure the
levels of exon skipping (Figure 4). Pip1–PNADMD and
RXR4–PNADMD each showed a small amount of exon
skipping at 2 mM, but Pip2a–PNADMD and Pip2b–
PNADMD showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of exon
skipping at both 1 and 2 mM concentrations. No exon
skipping was observed for naked PNADMD. This
shows that in the absence of any transfection method
Pip2a and Pip2b peptide conjugation enhances substan-
tially the cell and nuclear delivery of PNADMD into
mdx muscle cells as compared to the other peptides.
Speciﬁcity of exon skipping by PNADMD compared to
a sense control PNA was observed by electroporation of
0.5 nmol quantities into the mdx myoblasts. Naked
PNADMD, Pip2a–PNADMD and Pip2b–PNADMD
each showed exon skipping as expected when electropo-
rated into the cells, whereas the sense control PNA
showed no exon skipping (Supplementary Figure 1).
Cell viability was checked by a standard MTS assay for
Pip2a–PNADMD and Pip2b–PNADMD. No signiﬁcant
loss of viability was seen for mdx mouse muscle cells
treated with 2 mM conjugate and the viability at 5 mM
was 80–85% (data not shown).
Exon skipping and dystrophin expression following
intramuscular injection in themdxmouse
The exon-skipping eﬀects of naked PNADMD and
PNADMD–peptide conjugates were evaluated in mdx
mice by local intramuscular injection. Six- to eight-week-
old mdx mice (referred to as 8 weeks) were injected with a
single dose of 5 mg PNA or PNA–peptide conjugate into
the TA muscle. Two weeks after injection all treated TA
muscles were harvested and dystrophin-positive ﬁbres
were identiﬁed by immunohistochemistry (Figure 5a).
Inspection of whole-muscle transverse sections after a
single injection of PNA or PNA–peptide conjugates
showed widespread and uniform distribution of dystro-
phin-positive ﬁbres throughout the muscle cross-sections,
except in the cases of Pip1–PNADMD-treated mice, in
which only a limited number of dystrophin-positive
ﬁbres was observed, and the untreated mdx mouse control
(Figure 5a). Of particular interest were Pip2a–PNADMD-
and Pip2b–PNADMD-treated mdx muscles which showed
a highly signiﬁcant increase (P< 0.05) in the number
of dystrophin-positive myoﬁbres compared with those
treated with PNA alone, Pip1 and RXR4–PNA conju-
gates compared with age-matched control mdx mice
(Figure 5b). Consistent with these immunohistochemistry
data, RT-PCR analysis showed the expected exon 23
skipped bands (Figure 5c).
DISCUSSION
Pip2a and Pip2b are representatives of a new class of cell-
penetrating peptide with enhanced serum-stability and
higher cell delivery potential. We chose PNA (over
PMO) as the ON cargo type because of its ready synthetic
accessibility and ability to be conjugated to peptides by
either disulphide or stable thioether linkages. Pip2a- and
Pip2b–PNA conjugates showed higher activity than

an energy-dependent uptake mechanism. (b) The eﬀect of endocytosis

are shown as relative light units per microgram protein, rather than

inhibitor experiment. Cpz=chlorpromazine, mBCD=methyl-b-cyclo-

in vivo in a mouse mdx TA muscle injection model. Pip2a

an Arg-rich domain, a hydrophobic segment and a
broadly cationic segment. However, the structure-activity

redirection than a mere juxtaposition of two cationic seg-
ments surrounding a hydrophobic segment. Within each
segment there appear to be further sequence selectivities.
For example, aminohexanoyl spacing within segment 1 is
advantageous and some spacing of cationic residues in
segment 3 also seems important (37). Note that activity
levels are not related to the presence of a pH sensitive His
residue in segment 3, since Lys in this position gives equal
activity (Supplementary Table 1). We also reported pre-
viously that the eﬃciency of splicing redirection for
R6Pen-PNA705 does not appear to be correlated with
the membrane crossing potential of the Penetratin peptide
itself (33).
Serum-stabilized Pip2a and Pip2b provided a good
starting point for in vivo studies. These 25-mer peptides
were several times more active as conjugates of PNA705
when compared to the 15-mer RXR4 peptide, which is the
leading peptide used for in vivo studies with PMO conju-
gation (13,20), whilst showing similar stability to serum
proteolysis under the conditions studied (Figure 2). The
signiﬁcantly higher activity levels observed in both muscle
cell and in vivo assays for the longer Pip2 peptide (25-mer)
compared to the shorter RXR4 (15-mer) justiﬁes the use
of a longer peptide. However, additional structure–func-
tion analysis may yet identify shorter variants with main-
tained or enhanced activity.
We showed recently that splicing redirection activity of
a PMO705 conjugate of RXR4 (39) and a PNA705 con-
jugate of R6Pen (37) had much lower activities when incu-
bated with HeLa pLuc705 cells at 48C compared to 378C
(Figure 3a), suggesting in each case an energy-dependent
cell uptake mechanism. We showed here in side-by-side
comparison that both Pip2b and RXR4, when conjugated
to PNA705 also appear to have energy-dependent uptake
pathways, suggesting that this is a general property
imparted by Arg-rich CPPs.
We and others have shown that ONs conjugated to
cationic CPPs bind to heparan sulphate on the surface
of HeLa cells and upon entry appear to become trapped
within endocytotic vesicles (26,28,30,38). Our current
study is of the eﬀect of endocytosis inhibitors on splicing
redirection (Figure 3b) and is therefore focused on the
biologically active part of the conjugate that is undergoing
cellular uptake. These results show clearly, and for the ﬁrst
time, that in HeLa pLuc705 cells clathrin-dependent endo-
cytosis seems to be the major uptake route for biologically
available Pip2b–PNA705 conjugate. The implementation
of an energy-dependent endocytic pathway of cellular
uptake, as opposed to direct membrane translocation,
for most CPPs is still the object of debate. Most studies
have relied on ﬂuorescently labelled ONs and observation
of the cellular locations by microscopy and the eﬀect of
endocytosis inhibitors on such uptake and localization
(40,41), rather than a biological assay, as carried out
here. Likewise, controversies still exist concerning which
endocytotic pathway, macropinocytosis (40,41) or cla-
thrin-coated pits [(38) and this study], is the major route
of internalization for cationic CPPs. The cases for each of
these pathways have been laid out in a recent review of
cellular uptake of CPPs (42). Again we feel that monitor-
ing a biological response in the presence of a range of
inhibitors is more relevant than relying on the uptake of
ﬂuorescent conjugates.
In preliminary studies, co-incubation of HeLa pLuc705
cells with 200 nM CPP–PNA705 conjugates and a cell-
permeabilizing agent saponin led to substantial increases
in luciferase production resultant from splicing redirection
for both Pip2b–PNA705 and RXR4–PNA705, with the
former being only marginally more active than the latter
(data not shown). By contrast there is at least a 3- to 4-fold
higher activity of Pip2b–PNA705 compared to RXR4–
PNA705 in the absence of a transfection or permeabiliza-
tion agent. This suggests that endosomal trapping is a
main limitation for splicing redirection activity and that
the Pip2b peptide may therefore trigger a better endo-
somal release than RXR4. Further experiments to conﬁrm
these observations with a range of CPP–PNAs under a
variety of cell conditions are in progress and results will
be reported later.
In the absence of any transfection agent, Pip2a–
PNADMD and Pip2b–PNADMD showed signiﬁcant
exon-skipping activity in mouse mdx myotubes in the
low micromolar range whereas RXR4–PNADMD
showed only slight activity (Figure 4). Despite the quanti-
tative diﬀerences between splicing redirection and exon
skipping levels, the correlation between enhancements of
activity for PNA conjugates of Pip peptides over RXR4
peptide in the HeLa cell and mouse muscle cell models is
reassuring and demonstrates that better cell permeation
and nuclear delivery is a general property imparted by
the Pip peptide series. A similar correlation seems also
to hold in vivo, based on immunohistological analysis of
mouse TA muscles treated with Pip2a–PNADMD or
Pip2b–PNADMD compared to RXR4-PNADMD
(Figure 5a and b). The relatively poor activity of Pip1–
PNADMD in mdx muscle cells and in vivo, in contrast to
the HeLa cell result for Pip1–PNA705, presumably reﬂects
the need for better proteolytic stability of the CPP in the
mdx muscle system, since cell and in vivo data appear to
correlate well.
The low levels of exon skipping at the RNA level
observed for all constructs after a single local injection
into the TA muscle (Figure 5c) prevented determination
of diﬀerences between conjugates in exon-skipping levels.
These levels are much lower than those reported in the
same TA injection model for naked PMO (8), and for
exon-skipping levels in systemic mouse delivery reported
for naked PMO (8,43), for RXR4XB–PMO conjugate (20)
or very recently for a derivative of RXR4 (B peptide,
which contains two b-Ala replacements for aminohexa-
noyl) (44). However, in all these studies the PMO used
was a 25-mer, whereas so far only a 20-mer PNA sequence
has been tested here and in our previous studies in the
mouse mdx model (14). In human myoblast cell culture,
25- to 31-mer 20OMePS ONs were found to be signiﬁ-
cantly more eﬀective in dystrophin exon skipping than
20-mer (45), but the eﬀect of length of ON has not been
clearly evaluated for these and other ON types in vivo.
Note that for the ﬁrst clinical trial of a PMO ON for
DMD treatment a 30-mer is being used (12). We are cur-
rently investigating the optimum length for PNA in vivo in
comparison to PMO. However for either cargo type, the

signiﬁcant improvements in number of dystrophin positive
ﬁbres seen in the case of Pip2a and Pip2b suggest that
these peptides are good candidates for further in vivo eva-
luation for enhancement of exon-skipping activity and
may oﬀer advantages over the RXR4 peptide series.
Such in vivo experiments are also currently in progress.
