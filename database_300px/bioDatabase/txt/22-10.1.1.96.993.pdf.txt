ABSTRACT
In order to understand gene regulation, accurate and
comprehensive knowledge of transcriptional regula-
tory elements is essential. Here, we report our efforts
in building a mammalian Transcriptional Regulatory
Element Database (TRED) with associated data ana-
lysis functions. It collects cis- and trans-regulatory
elements and is dedicated to easy data access and
analysis for both single-gene-based and genome-
scale studies. Distinguishing features of TRED
include: (i) relatively complete genome-wide pro-
moter annotation for human, mouse and rat; (ii) avail-
ability of gene transcriptional regulation information
including transcription factor binding sites and
experimental evidence; (iii) data accuracy is ensured
by hand curation; (iv) efficient user interface for easy
and flexible data retrieval; and (v) implementation of
on-the-fly sequence analysis tools. TREDcanprovide
good training datasets for further genome-wide cis-
regulatory element prediction and annotation, assist
detailed functional studies and facilitate the decipher
of gene regulatory networks (http://rulai.cshl.edu/
TRED).
INTRODUCTION
To understand gene regulatory mechanisms and networks
requires accurate and comprehensive knowledge of transcrip-
tional regulatory elements. They include cis-elements, such as
promoters and trans-elements, such as transcription factors.
A number of databases have been created to facilitate such
studies. However, most of them are only dedicated to either
promoter annotation or transcription factor binding and func-
tional information, which make data access disconnected and
correlation of different types of data difficult. Hence, we are
motivated to build a unique resource for both cis- and trans-
regulatory elements, and provide easy access of the correlation
between promoter sequences and transcription factor binding
information.
Although current promoter databases have provided much
value for the development of promoter-finding programs and
gene regulation studies (1,2), many have their own limitations.
These include incomplete datasets, inadequate data accuracy,
restricted accessibility of the data and lack of sequence ana-
lysis functionalities. On top of single-gene-based and whole
genome experimental promoter identification, computational
methods are greatly needed for efficient genome-wide promo-
ter annotation. However, in higher eukaryotes, promoter find-
ing in silico has turned out to be one of the most difficult
problems in computational biology (3). Therefore, accurate
promoter annotation for all the genes in higher eukaryotes
is still an outstanding challenge.
Collecting comprehensive and precise transcription factor
binding and regulation information currently known is a
daunting task. It involves painstaking and time-consuming
literature curation by transcription study experts. Although
there are a limited number of databases (4,5) dedicated to
this aspect of data collection, they often do not conveniently
correlate functional information to the relevant promoter
sequences and its genomic context that are required in
most of the regulation studies. Furthermore, inevitably, data
completeness is always an issue.
Here, we report our efforts in building a Transcriptional
Regulatory Element Database (TRED) with associated data
analysis functions. With the availability of complete genome
sequences for human and draft sequences for mouse and rat,
we have mapped out and documented in the database gene
transcription start sites (TSSs) and core promoters for the
whole genomes through both automated pipeline and hand
curation. In addition, we have been carrying out continuous
expert curation of transcription factor binding and regulation
information on these promoters. Our short-term goal is to pro-
vide comprehensive and accurate trans-regulatory information
for target genes of cancer-related transcription factors. We
have so far included binding data for a few transcription factors,
with emphasis on twomajor cell cycle regulators, E2FandMyc.
For each, we have recorded thousands of target genes of differ-
ent binding qualities as demonstrated by various experiments.

Aweb-based user interface has been implemented for easy data
visualization, retrieval and analysis for both single-gene-based
studies and large-scale sequence manipulation and gene reg-
ulatory network studies. We intend to build TRED to contain
information of both cis- and trans-regulatory elements for every
annotated gene, and to serve as a one-stop data provider for
researchers interested in gene regulation studies.
DATA SOURCES
Promoter annotation
Promoters in TRED came from two sources: automated gen-
ome-wide annotation and hand curation. They complement
each other, and together realize the relative completeness
and accuracy of the data. The automated annotation pipeline
was built to extract and merge known promoters from data-
bases such as EPD and DBTSS (1,6), employing promoter-
finding programs such as FirstEF (7) combined with mRNA/
EST information and cross-species comparisons to predict
promoters, and associating them with known or predicted
genes (Z. Xuan, F. Zhao, J. Wang, G. Chen and
M. Q. Zhang, submitted for publication). Given the difficulty
and complexity of promoter prediction in higher eukaryotes,
accuracy of computational promoter annotation is limited.
Therefore, hand curation was applied as a crucial part of
our data collection to assess computational prediction and
ensure data accuracy. After we pooled data from both sources,
further data cleaning and integration were carried out. Based
on the reliability of the supporting evidence for each promoter,
a quality level was assigned.
Transcription factor binding curation
Curationwas carried out for transcriptional regulation informa-
tion on promoters. Exhaustive literature search for target genes
of individual transcription factors was carried out, binding
motifs and experimental evidencewere recorded, and transcrip-
tion factor binding motifs were mapped on promoters of the
target genes. Binding quality levels were assigned based on
definitiveness of the binding evidence, which was determined
by the experimental approaches employed to demonstrate the
binding and expert data interpretation. A standardized curation
format has been developed for easy data entry and automated
data loading into the database. To best preserve the curated
association between motifs and promoters through changes
such as genome assembly releases and genome annotations,
we also record motif flanking sequences.
Curation is a time-consuming and laborious process, and we
started out by focusing on target genes of cancer-related tran-
scription factors. In compliance with the broad interest in cell
cycle regulatorynetwork studies,wehavecompletedcuration for
transcription factorE2FandMyc target genes.They are involved
in various biological pathways and have profound effects in cell
proliferation (8–13).ManyE2F andMyc target genes have been
identified by traditional transcription studies as well as newly
developed, large-scale functional genomics studies.
DATABASE CONSTRUCTION AND
IMPLEMENTATION
A MySQL relational database was constructed for
storage and query of the data. It includes three key entities:
‘Promoter’, ‘Gene’ and ‘Factor’. ‘Promoter’ is a weak entity

Promoter qualities ranked from high to low: 1, known, curated promoters; 2, known, pipeline collected promoters; 3, predicted promoters with Refseq evidence and
putative promoters taking 50 ends of Refseq as TSSs; 4, predicted promoters with mRNA (other than Refseq and EST) evidence; 5, predicted promoters with EST
evidence; 6, predicted promoters supported only by gene prediction.
Promoters included in a higher ranking are automatically excluded from the lower ranking categories.

because our model would not allow a promoter to exist without
the associated gene. There are two key relationships: (i) a
promoter regulates a gene, which is a many-to-one relation-
ship; and (ii) a factor binds a promoter, which is a many-to-
many relationship. Other entities in the relational schema
include promoter qualities, binding motifs, binding qualities
and external data sources. Other relationships include gene
annotation, promoter supporting evidence, factor annotation
and binding supporting evidence. An automated data look-up,
integration and loading pipeline has been developed for easy
populating and updating the database.
DATABASE CONTENT
TRED contains whole genome promoter annotation for
human, mouse and rat from both curation and computational
prediction. The number of genes and promoters in various
quality categories are listed in Table 1. From our extensive

literature curation, TRED holds functional annotations of
hundreds of direct target genes for E2F and Myc in human,
mouse and rat with concrete binding evidence (high binding
quality levels) (Table 2). Many of them have experimentally
verified promoter sequences and known E2F or Myc binding
motifs. It also has a collection of thousands of genes shown to
be regulated by E2F andMyc of lower binding confidence (e.g.
only demonstrated by expression experiments or computa-
tional prediction). This is a more comprehensive collection
than that recorded for these two transcription factors in
the Transfac database (4). Some target genes for a few
other transcription factors are also included in the current
release of TRED. To provide users with further information
of the genes, cross-references to other well-known databases
such as GenBank, PubMed, GeneCards (14) and Transfac
were established.
WEB INTERFACE
Data access and retrieval
A CGI/Perl-based web interface was built to facilitate easy
visualization and retrieval of both single-gene-based and batch
data. It carries the following major functionalities.
(i) Search promoters for a gene or a list of genes by gene
name, GenBank ID or chromosome location (Figure 1).
The resulting page contains all annotated promoters for
the gene, ranked from the highest quality to the lowest.
Links for gene information and promoter information
(including localization of transcription factor binding
sites) are provided by the hotlinks in ‘Gene ID’ and
‘Promoter ID’ columns, respectively (see Figure 1).
Sequence retrieval of desired promoters can be achieved

by checking the box on the left of each entry. Sequence
length for retrieval can be decided by users, with the
default being 1 kb (700 bp upstream and 299 bp down-
stream of TSS). Promoter sequences of interest can also
be conveniently sent to ‘on-the-fly analysis’ page for
further analysis (see below).
(ii) Gene information page displays the annotation and pro-
moter links for a particular gene, as well as transcription
factors that regulate the gene, experimental evidence
and literature references. A link is provided to locate
the gene on UCSC Genome Browser and access addi-
tional annotations (Figure 1).
(iii) Promoter information page includes genomic localization
of the promoter, annotation references and the sequence,
with transcription factor binding sites marked and hot
linked to detailed binding information and literature refer-
ences. A link is provided to locate the promoter on UCSC
Genome Browser and access its genomic context (Figure 1).
(iv) Retrieve promoter sequences for all target genes of a
transcription factor, with the option of filtering sequences
for desired promoters and binding qualities (Figure 2).
This will conveniently produce good datasets for compu-
tational studies on transcriptional regulons and networks,
as well as for the development and training of computa-
tional tools such as motif-finding programs.
(v) Retrieve all binding motifs for a transcription factor
(Figure 2). This can greatly facilitate the construction
of transcription factor binding positional weight matrices
(PWMs) for target gene identification and gene regulation
studies.
(vi) Browse the genome for genes/promoters located in a
particular chromosome.
(vii) Search for orthologous genes based on the annotation in
Ensembl.
On-the-fly analysis tools
On-the-fly analysis tools were implemented for sequences
retrieved from TRED or imported from other resources
(Figure 2). They currently include simple sequence mani-
pulation and analysis tools for users’ convenience and
motif-matching programs based on regular expression and
PWM. A word counting-based motif searching tool DWE
(15) and PromoterWise, a program specifically for pair-wise
promoter local alignment (E. Birney, unpublished), are also
implemented. Promoters on various TRED sub-pages can be
directly sent to these analysis tools at a click of a button.
In addition to the on-the-fly tools, TRED also provides links
to many other sequence analysis and motif-finding programs
such as MEME (16) and Gibbs sampler (17).
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Updating of genome-wide promoter annotation based on
newer genome assembly releases can be automated and will
be done for the next release. Promoter annotation for mammals
other than human, mouse and rat will be carried out and
included in TRED. For transcription factor binding and reg-
ulation information, literature curation has been a continuing
effort. We hope to finish target genes of cancer-related tran-
scription factors in the near future, and eventually expand to
targets of other transcription factors.
