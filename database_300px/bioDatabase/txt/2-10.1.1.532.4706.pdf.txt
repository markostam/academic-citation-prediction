ABSTRACT
The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi,
encodes a novel type of DNA-binding protein named
EbfC. Orthologs of EbfC are encoded by a wide
range of bacterial species, so characterization of
the borrelial protein has implications that span the
eubacterial kingdom. The present work defines
the DNA sequence required for high-affinity binding
by EbfC to be the 4bp broken palindrome GTnAC,
where ‘n’ can be any nucleotide. Two high-affinity
EbfC-binding sites are located immediately 5’ of
B. burgdorferi erp transcriptional promoters, and
binding of EbfC was found to alter the conformation
of erp promoter DNA. Consensus EbfC-binding
sites are abundantly distributed throughout the
B. burgdorferi genome, occurring approximately
once every 1 kb. These and other features of EbfC
suggest that this small protein and its orthologs may
represent a distinctive type of bacterial nucleoid-
associated protein. EbfC was shown to bind DNA
as a homodimer, and site-directed mutagenesis
studies indicated that EbfC and its orthologs
appear to bind DNA via a novel a-helical ‘tweezer’-
like structure.
INTRODUCTION
The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is
maintained in nature through cycles of alternating infec-
tions of vertebrate hosts and tick vectors. To facilitate
infection of those distinctive types of animals, and to
enable eﬃcient transmission between hosts and vectors,
B. burgdorferi controls production of a large number of
bacterial proteins. Among these are the Erp proteins, a
polymorphic family of surface-exposed, outer membrane
lipoproteins that are expressed throughout mammalian
infection but largely repressed during tick colonization
(1). Known functions of Erp family members include
binding of the host serum components complement
factor H and plasminogen, and adherence to the extracel-
lular matrix protein laminin (2–10). All Lyme disease
spirochetes contain multiple variants of related prophages,
known as cp32 elements, which replicate episomally as
32 kb circular plasmids (11–14). Each cp32 contains a
mono- or bicistronic-erp locus. The B. burgdorferi type
strain, B31, is known to harbor 10 diﬀerent cp32 family
members, and encodes 13 distinct Erp proteins (1,15).
Despite the often extensive sequence variation found
among erp open reading frames, all erp loci share a uni-
fying feature in possessing highly conserved sequences
immediately 50 of the open reading frames. Within this
DNA sequence is the transcriptional promoter and two

operator sites that bind cytoplasmic proteins (16).
Transcriptional fusion studies identiﬁed that the operator
region closest to the transcriptional promoter, Operator 2,
is involved in transcriptional repression (16). Members of
our laboratories recently discovered that a chromosomally
encoded protein of B. burgdorferi, named EbfC, speciﬁ-
cally binds two sites within erp Operator 2 (17).
Many other species of bacteria encode orthologs of
EbfC, suggesting that this protein performs a function(s)
conserved throughout the kingdom Eubacteria. These
homologous proteins have been variously classed as
‘domain of unknown function’ 149, Pfam 2575, COG-
0718 and YbaB (18,19). The 3D structures of the
Escherichia coli and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae orthologs
have been determined (18) and (http://www.rcsb.org/
pdb/explore.do?structureId=1PUG). Both proteins crys-
tallized as dimers, consisting of a central b-folded dimer-
interface region and protruding a-helices at either end,
forming a distinctive structure that has been described as
having a ‘tweezer-like’ shape (18). The present studies
extended characterization of the B. burgdorferi EbfC pro-
tein, demonstrating that this small protein both speciﬁ-
cally and nonspeciﬁcally binds DNA, can bind DNA
independently of context and alters DNA conformation.
Site-directed mutagenesis approaches were also employed
to investigate the mode of interaction between EbfC
and DNA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Site-directed mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis of both the erpAB Operator 2
and ebfC were performed by sequence overlap extension
PCR mutagenesis (20). Primers used in the PCR reac-
tions are listed on Table 1. All mutagenized plasmids
were sequenced on both strands to verify the desired
mutations.
Recombinant EbfC
Proteins were produced from either p462M5 (17) or
mutant derivatives thereof (Table 1), using E. coli
Rosetta (DE3) (pLysS) (Novagen). Following induction
by addition of 1mM isopropylthio-b-galactopyranoside,
bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed
by sonication in 20mM NaPO4, 0.5M NaCl, 30mM
imidazole, pH 7.4. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation
and injected onto 5ml HisTrap-HP columns using an
A¨KTA-FPLC with UPC-900 UV absorbance monitor
and Frac920 fraction collector (GE Healthcare).
Columns were subjected to the lysis buﬀer containing a
linear gradient of imidazole ranging from 30mM
to 750mM. Fractions (1ml each) were collected, and
aliquots subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophor-
esis (SDS-PAGE) with Coomassie brilliant blue staining,
to assess protein purity. Proteins were concentrated using
YM-30 Centricon columns (Amicon), then dialyzed
against 50mM Tris–HCl, 1mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
ﬂuoride, 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, pH
7.5. Recombinant protein concentrations were determined
by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assays (Pierce).
Aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored
at 808C. Frozen protein preparations were thawed on ice
immediately before use.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
Sequences of biotinylated DNAs used to deﬁne optimal
EbfC-binding activities by electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (EMSA) are illustrated in Figure 1. DNAs were
produced by PCR ampliﬁcation using appropriate pri-
mers, templates and LA Taq polymerase (Takara).
Ampliﬁcation consisted of 40 cycles of 948C for 1min,
558C for 1min and 688C for 1min. Reaction products
were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visua-
lized by staining with ethidium bromide. DNAs were
extracted into nuclease-free water using Wizard SV gel
puriﬁcation system (Promega). DNA concentrations

were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring
absorbance at 260 nm, with an absorbance of 1.0=
50 mg/ml DNA, then each diluted to a ﬁnal concentration
of 1 nM (10 stock).
EMSAs were performed using 100 pM biotin-labeled
double-stranded DNA probes as previously described
(16,17), with binding conditions of 50mM Tris–HCl,
1mM DTT, 8 ml/ml Protease inhibitor (Sigma. St. Louis,
MO), 2 ml/ml Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail II (Sigma),
50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, pH=7.5
at room temperature. Binding reactions were allowed
to proceed for 20min at room temperature, before
being subjected to electrophoresis through 6% DNA
Retardation Gels (Invitrogen) for a total of 9000V-min.
Gels were transferred to nylon membranes, cross-linked
by UV light and biotinylated DNAs were detected by
Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Modules
(Pierce) and Kodak Biomax ﬁlm.
Dissociation constant determination
Dissociation constants (Kd) for EbfC–DNA interactions
in the absence of poly-dI-dC were determined by analyses
of EMSA gel images (21). Exposed ﬁlms were scanned in
8 bit depth at 1200 dpi resolution, analyzed using Image J
1.37v (22) and the ratios of bound:free DNA in each lane
were determined. These values were transferred into
Microsoft Excel for graphing and analyses. The quantity
of DNA in each band or total lane was expressed as con-
centration of the known input DNA (23,24).
Binding was analyzed according to a model in which n
molecules of protein (P) bind DNA (D):
nPþD,Kd PnD 1
with the equilibrium constant:
Kd ¼ P½ 
n D½ 
PnD½  2
The Kd for the titration of DNA with EbfC were deter-
mined by graphing the ratio of bound to free DNA for
each reaction. These ratios were graphed in relation to
known concentration of free protein [P]. Since the ratios
of free protein to DNA were extremely high, the binding
of protein to DNA did not appreciatively change concen-
tration of free protein (21). The Kd is therefore the con-
centration of EbfC where the ratio of bound to free
DNA=1.
Rearranging Equation (2) and taking natural logs gives:
ln
D½ 
PnD½  ¼ n ln P½  þ lnKd
Thus, for EbfC, a graph of ln ([D]/[EbfCnD]) as a function
of ln [EbfC] will have a slope equal to the negative value
of the stoichiometry, n, and an x-intercept at which
Kd= nln [EbfC].
For EMSAs with two DNA probes, the ratio of bound
to free DNA cannot be determined for each speciﬁc DNA
probe, because it is impossible to determine which DNA
species is responsible for any single protein DNA complex.
As such, this analysis was performed by measuring the
disappearance of each individual free-DNA species. In
these cases, the calculated binding activities were the
ratios of protein concentrations at which each free-DNA
species disappeared by 50%.
DNA-bending analyses
Five 150 bp DNA fragments, overlapping stepwise by
30 bp increments over a total of 250 bp, were produced

lyzed by electrophoresis through 15% polyacrylamide gels
and staining with ethidium bromide. EMSAs using puri-

Size fractionation chromatography
The abilities of the various recombinant EbfC prepara-
tions to form multimeric structures were analyzed by
size fractionation chromatography as previously described
(17). Proteins were individually loaded onto a Superdex 75
10/300 column (GE Healthcare) and separated using a
Waters 600 pump and controller equipped with a Waters
996 UV/Vis detector.
EbfCmodel
The B. burgdorferi EbfC was modeled based on the
solved structure of the orthologous protein YbaB of
H. inﬂuenzae (PDB 1j8b) (18). The sequences of EbfC
and YbaB were aligned with BlastP (http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Amino acid side-chain substi-
tutions were made at positions of diﬀerent sequences
with the O-program (26). The alignment showed that com-
pared with YbaB, EbfC contains an additional amino
acid residue (Leu63) inserted into the loop before the
C-terminal a-helix. This loop (residues 61–65) was mod-
iﬁed to contain Leu63 so that its side chain would be in
close proximity to Phe59 and Ala67 to form hydrophobic
interactions. The resulting EbfC model was minimized
with the CNS program (27). The ﬁgure of the EbfC
model was generated with Molscript (28) and Raster3D
(29,30).
Analysis of ebfC sequences of Lyme disease Borrelia spp.
The ebfC loci of Lyme disease borreliae were ampliﬁed by
PCR using oligonucleotides EBFC-18 (50-CATCTGGCT
TAACAATACATAAAG-30) and EBFC-19 (50-GACAA
TGTTCTTTATTATAAGGTG-30), which are speciﬁc
for sequences bordering the B. burgdorferi strain B31
ebfC open reading frame on the 50 and 30 sides, respec-
tively. Bacteria analyzed in this work were B. burgdorferi
(sensu stricto) strains B31, N40, 297 and Sh-2-82, Borrelia
afzelii strains PKo and VS461, Borrelia garinii strain Ip90
and Borrelia bissettii strains 25015 and DN127.
RESULTS
Sequence-specific binding of DNA by EbfC
Our earlier EMSA studies found that competitor DNAs
containing the broken palindrome TGTA/TACA com-
peted for EbfC binding to erp promoters (Perp), while
DNAs that instead contained 50-CACA/TACA-30 did not
compete (17). To more precisely deﬁne the sequence
requirements for high-aﬃnity interactions between EbfC
and DNA, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to
create a series of variants in the Operator 2 region of the
strain B31 erpAB promoter (PerpAB).
Initially, mutants of PerpAB were produced in which
either site I, site II or both sites I and II were changed
to 50-CACAACA-30, all in the context of otherwise normal
PerpAB DNA sequences (Figure 1). EMSA using a probe
with the wild-type PerpAB sequence, b-WT, yielded two
observable DNA–EbfC complexes, with the slower mobil-
ity (upper) complex having a higher aﬃnity interaction
(Figure 2A). Probes that contain only one TGTA/TACA
palindrome (b-C1 and b-C2) exhibited the same two
EbfC–DNA complexes, but at decreased relative levels
(Figure 3A). The signal strengths of the slower mobility
complexes for EbfC binding to either probes b-C1 or b-C2
were approximately one half the value for b-WT. There
were no apparent diﬀerences in EbfC binding to DNA
probes that contained only wild type site I or site II, indi-
cating relatively equal aﬃnities for both sites. However,
the mutation of both TGTA/TACA palindromes in probe
b-C1/2 dramatically reduced EbfC binding (Figure 2A).
These results conﬁrm that EbfC preferentially binds the

previously identiﬁed palindromic sequence and demon-
strate that the apparent binding aﬃnity when two sites
are present is greater than when DNA contains only one
site. This was likely due to the higher relative concentra-
tion of high-aﬃnity binding sites when two adjacent
sequences are present, as opposed to a single site alone.
To identify the minimal DNA sequence required for
speciﬁc EbfC binding, additional DNA probes based on
PerpAB were produced in which site I was mutated to the
non-binding sequence, 50-CACAACA-30, and nucleotides
of site II were individually changed away from
TGTA/TACA (Figure 1). Changing either the seventh
nucleotide from A to T (b-C30) or the fourth nucleotide
from A/T to
G/C (b-C40) had no apparent aﬀect on binding
(Figure 2B, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). In contrast,
the mutation of the ﬁfth A to T (b-C50) or sixth C to A
(b-C20) eliminated the speciﬁc EbfC–DNA primary com-
plex 2 (Figure 2B, lanes 9 and 6, respectively). Thus the
minimum DNA sequence necessary for speciﬁc interaction
with EbfC is the four base broken palindrome GTnAC,
where n may be any nucleotide (Figure 2A). With these
results, EbfC is one of only two spirochetal DNA-binding
proteins for which the consensus high-aﬃnity binding
sequence has been determined (31).
Speciﬁcity of EbfC binding to DNA was assessed using
poly-dI-dC as a competitor for binding to PerpAB DNA.
Poly-dI-dC DNA forms normal DNA helices but does not
contain conventional DNA sequence due to the presence
of the inosine nucleotide. Using this DNA permitted sep-
aration of sequence speciﬁc from structural EbfC–DNA
interactions. Poly-dI-dC successfully competed only when
present in concentrations >1 ng/ml (Figure 3). Based on
the molar ratio of speciﬁc EbfC-binding sites in the
erpAB Operator 2 probe relative to the number of non-
speciﬁc 5 bp sequences in poly-dI-dC, EbfC has 40-fold
lower aﬃnity for poly-dI-dC than for PerpAB Operator 2.
EbfC binds DNA as a homodimer
The Kd for EbfC binding to Perp DNA was determined by
titrating increasing concentrations of recombinant EbfC
to labeled DNA probe b-WT, followed by EMSA analysis
of protein-DNA complex formation (Figure 4A). The
protein:DNA ratios in all reactions were extremely
high, such that binding of protein to DNA would not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the concentration of free protein. As
described in the following paragraph, EbfC binds DNA
as a homodimer. The calculated Kd for the reaction 2
EbfC+b-WT$ 2 EbfC/b-WT is 388 108 nM.
Serial dilution was also performed to conﬁrm that result
and to determine binding stoichiometry (Figure 4B). This
method allows estimation of the complex stoichiometry n
and the Kd (32). These analyses yielded a binding stoichio-
metry of n=2.0 EbfC monomers per DNA molecule,
indicating that EbfC binds DNA as a dimer (Figure 4C).
DNA-binding analyses of the E. coli and H. inﬂuenzae
EbfC orthologs yielded that same result (Cooley,A.E.
et al., submitted for publication). These data are also
consistent with the observed formation of B. burgdorferi
EbfC dimers in solution (17) and crystallization of the
E. coli and H. inﬂuenzae orthologs as homodimers (18)
and (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=
1PUG). By this technique, the calculated Kd for dimeric
recombinant EbfC binding to Perp Operator 2 DNA was
313 nM, consistent with the results obtained from our
other analyses described above.
DNA-binding by EbfC is context independent
All of the probes used in the above studies contained EbfC
binding site(s) in the context of PerpAB (Figure 1).

tively. (B) Serial dilution of non-equilibrated EbfC+DNA reactions. A
mixture of 3mM EbfC and 4nM b-WT was produced and immediately
serially diluted with three volumes of the previous tube and one volume
of binding buﬀer. Final concentrations of EbfC were 3.0, 2.3, 1.7, 1.3,
0.98, 0.74, 0.56, 0.42, 0.32, 0.24, 0.18mM and concentrations of probe
b-WT were 4.0, 3.1, 2.4, 1.9, 1.4, 1.1, 0.88, 0.68, 0.52, 0.41, 0.31 nM for
the mixtures in lanes 1–11, respectively. These reactions were allowed to
equilibrate before loading equal volumes onto the gel to perform the
mobility shift assay. (C) Band intensities from (B) were determined
and ln([D]/[EbfCnD]) was graphed as a function of ln [EbfC].
The slope of the resulting line is equal to n, the negative value
of the binding stoichiometry and the x-intercept is the point at which
n ln [EbfC]= lnKd.

As mentioned above, all erp promoters contain two EbfC
binding sites. In the strain B31 erpHY locus, EbfC binding
site I is identical to that of PerpAB and all other known
erp promoters, but site II is altered to a non-binding 50-GT
AAT-30 (16,17). However, other sequence changes in
PerpHY created a new EbfC-binding consensus immedi-
ately 50 of site II, which we designate site III (Figure 1).
This alternative site is particularly noteworthy, because
the diﬀerent spacing of the two sites in PerpHY could
inﬂuence EbfC–DNA interactions. To study that possibi-
lity, PerpAB was mutated to resemble PerpHY by disrup-
tion of site II and creation of site III, both with and
without a consensus site I. As anticipated, in the absence
of a consensus site I, changing the site II sequence from
that of PerpAB to the non-consensus sequence of PerpHY
eliminated speciﬁc binding (Figure 5A, lane 5 [b-C1/2]).
However, in that same context, creation of a consensus
sequence at site III was suﬃcient for EbfC binding
(Figure 5A, lane 6 [b-C1/2+3]). Notably, mobilities of
EbfC–DNA complexes formed with probes containing a
consensus sequence at site III were comparable to those
with wild type PerpAB sequences.
The eﬀects of surrounding DNA sequences on EbfC
binding were also examined through use of constructs cre-
ated by insertion of short DNA sequences into the
TA-cloning site of plasmid pCR2.1. Labeled probes were
produced from those constructs by PCR using the vector’s
M13F and M13R priming sites, and consisted of the DNA
insert ﬂanked by pCR2.1 DNA. That DNA is relatively
rich in G+C content as compared with the high A+T
content of PerpAB and the rest of the B. burgdorferi
genome [www.invitrogen.com/content/sfs/vectors/pcr2_
1topo_map.pdf and (15,33)]. Inclusion of a 29 bp sequence
of PerpAB that contained two GTnAC palindromes
yielded strong EbfC binding (Figure 5B, lanes 1–3
[b-SRK-A]). As a control, the same sequence in which
both EbfC-binding sites were changed to 50-ACAAC-30
did not form the speciﬁc EbfC–DNA complex 2
(Figure 5B, lanes 4–6 [b-SRK-B]). A single EbfC-binding
site on either a 13 or 7 bp insert yielded production of the
speciﬁc EbfC–DNA complex 2 (Figure 5B, lanes 7–9
[b-SRK-C] and 10–12 [b-SRK-D], respectively). Thus,
we conclude that EbfC is able to bind GTnAC sequences
regardless of the composition of surrounding DNA, and is
therefore likely to bind any consensus sequence within the
B. burgdorferi genome.
Binding of EbfC affects DNA bending
DNA-binding proteins often change the conformation of
targeted DNA. To examine whether or not EbfC-binding
alters DNA conformation, its eﬀects upon erpAB 50 DNA
were examined.
Five overlapping 150 bp fragments of PerpAB were pro-
duced, spanning a 250 bp region of erpAB centered on
the two high-aﬃnity EbfC-binding sites (Figure 6A).
Modeling analyses of this 250 bp sequence predicted an
extended region of DNA curvature that includes the pro-
moter 35 and 10 regions (Figure 6A). Polyacrylamide
electrophoresis of the ﬁve 150 bp fragments conﬁrmed that
prediction, probes 4 and 5, which contain the predicted
bent region toward their centers, migrated more slowly
than did probe 1, which does not contain the predicted
bent region (Figure 6B and C). This is the ﬁrst reported
occurrence of naturally bent DNA in a spirochete, and its
juxtaposition with PerpAB suggests that the bend may
impact upon levels of erp transcription.
The eﬀect of EbfC on the innate bend in PerpAB was
next examined by EMSA. EbfC complexes with DNA
probes 2, 3 and 4 all migrated at the same rates, while
free probe 4 was retarded relative to probes 2 and 3, as
above (Figure 6D). Thus, binding of EbfC to erp Operator
2 alters the conformation of PerpAB DNA.
The ‘tweezer’ domain of EbfC is vital for DNA binding
The EbfC ortholog of H. inﬂuenzae KW20 Rd (YbaB,
HI_0442) shares 27.5% identity and 59.3% similarity
with B. burgdorferi EbfC (Figure 7A). As noted in the
Introduction section, both the H. inﬂuenzae and E. coli
EbfC orthologs have been crystallized, with both forming
nearly identical structures with a ‘tweezer’-like appearance
(18). The predicted gap between the ‘tweezer’ arms of
EbfC ranges between 15 and 22 A˚, comparable with the

diameter of B-DNA, suggesting that the protruding
a-helices could form the DNA-binding domain (18,34).
To address that hypothesis, site directed mutagenesis of
B. burgdorferi EbfC was performed to individually replace
nine of the amino acids in those a-helices (Figure 7A
and B). Each recombinant protein was expressed and pur-
iﬁed two separate times, to guard against preparation arti-
facts. None of the mutated variants of EbfC was able to
detectably bind PerpAB, even when tested at protein con-
centrations 6.5-fold greater than the wild-type EbfC
(Figure 7C).
Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that wild-
type EbfC and the K16A, D20A, K23A, D78A, K82A,
K84A, E85A and K88A mutants all preferentially formed
dimers in solution (data not shown) (17). The N77A
mutant protein did not form higher order structures, indi-
cating that this residue, which is predicted to be located
adjacent to the b-folded region of EbfC, plays a role in
dimerization. These results indicate that the dimerization
and DNA binding functions of EbfC are distinct, with the
DNA-binding function residing in the a-helical ‘tweezer’
domains.
EbfC also forms tetramers and octamers in solution
(17). The K16A, D20A, K23A, D78A, K82A, K84A,
E85A and K88A mutants all retained ability to form
those higher ordered multimers (data not shown), indicat-
ing that all aspects of EbfC multimerization are indepen-
dent of its ability to bind DNA.
EbfC is conserved among Lyme disease spirochetes
The bacteria that cause Lyme disease have been divided
into several genospecies, including B. burgdorferi (sensu
stricto) and B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. bissettii, each of
which is associated with diﬀerent symptoms in humans
and degrees of infectivity (35–37). To ascertain the degrees
of EbfC sequence conservation among Lyme disease spiro-
chetes, ebfC loci were sequenced from several strains of
distinct borrelial genospecies, isolated from across North
America and Eurasia. All of the examined bacteria encode
an identical EbfC protein, suggestive of constraints upon
sequence variation and indicating that the results obtained
from the present work on the EbfC protein of B. burgdor-
feri strain B31 are applicable to all Lyme disease bacteria.

DISCUSSION
A previous study from our laboratories discovered that
B. burgdorferi EbfC is a DNA-binding protein.
Orthologs of EbfC are encoded by a large number of
other bacterial species, suggesting a kingdom-wide, con-
served function for this protein. Analyses of crystallized
EbfC orthologs of H. inﬂuenzae and E. coli revealed a
unique, ‘tweezer’ like structure. The present studies indi-
cated that the extending a-helices that comprise the
‘tweezer’ arms are involved in binding DNA, a feature
that suggests the EbfC family to constitute a new type
of DNA-binding protein. EbfC bound to DNA as a
dimer, consistent with crystallographic data from the
H. inﬂuenzae and E. coli orthologs.
The present studies revealed that B. burgdorferi EbfC
preferentially binds DNA containing the sequence
GTnAC, where n=any nucleotide. This sequence
occurs 833 times on the major chromosome of B. burgdor-
feri strain B31, a frequency of one site every 1093 base
pairs. The B. burgdorferi EbfC can also bind DNA which
lacks a GTnAC sequence. These features suggest that
EbfC is not a gene-speciﬁc regulatory protein, as originally
hypothesized (16,17). Instead, this protein’s simple and
abundant binding sequence, abilities to bind DNA
nonspeciﬁcally and to alter DNA conformation, plus its
small size, are characteristics shared with bacterial
nucleoid-associated proteins (38,39). EbfC forms tetra-
mers and octamers in solution, and mutations that prevent
DNA-binding did not disrupt ability to form those higher
ordered structures. Thus the multimerization and DNA-
binding activities of EbfC are distinct, raising the possibil-
ity that EbfC might also multimerize when bound to
DNA and thereby serve as a bridge to condense DNA.
The genome of B. burgdorferi is the most complex bacte-
rial genome yet to be analyzed. The sequenced genome of
the type strain, B31, consists of a linear major chromo-
some and more than 20 other linear and circular smaller
chromosomes/plasmids/episomal prophages (15,33,40).
The mechanisms by which this bacterium facilitates main-
tenance, partitioning and compaction of this complex
genome are largely unknown (41). The well studied
E. coli compacts its chromosome through DNA super
coiling and interactions with small DNA-binding
proteins, the nucleoid-associated or ‘histone-like’ proteins
(38,39,42,43). To date, 12 major nucleoid-associated pro-
teins have been identiﬁed in E. coli (38,39,42). In addition
to functioning in chromatin organization and compaction,
nucleoid-associated proteins often play roles in a variety

of other DNA processes, such as modulation of transcrip-
tion, transposition, recombination, repair and DNA rep-
lication (38,44–46). The combination of structural and
regulatory roles suggests that the global genome functions
of the nucleoid are tightly linked to its organizational abil-
ity (47,48). Prior to this work, only two B. burgdorferi
proteins had been identiﬁed which exhibit activities
resembling those of nucleoid-associated proteins. The
B. burgdorferi Hbb protein, which resembles E. coli HU
and integration host factor (IHF), can bind and bend
DNA, and is capable of complementing some functions
of an E. coli HU/IHF mutant (49–51). A second known
protein, Gac, is produced from independent synthesis of
the carboxy-terminal domain of GyrA, and can comple-
ment an E. coli HU mutant to promote Mu DNA trans-
position (52). The roles of those two putative nucleoid-
associated proteins in maintaining B. burgdorferi DNA
have not yet been deﬁned. The B. burgdorferi genome
does not contain any recognizable homologs of known
bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins such as H-NS
or Fis (33). Thus, the current picture is that B. burgdorferi
compacts its segmented genome, which consists largely
of linear DNAs, using only Hbb, Gac and, we hypothe-
size, EbfC.
The B. burgdorferi ebfC is located immediately 30 of
dnaX, and the two genes are transcriptionally linked [our
unpublished results and (17,33)]. Thus, EbfC protein levels
are likely linked to those of the dnaX products, the g and 
subunits of DNA polymerase III. If additional analyses
conﬁrm that EbfC is in fact a nucleoid-associated protein,
then the connection between DNA replication and DNA
conformation aﬀorded by the dnaX-ebfC locus may prove
central to the vitality of B. burgdorferi. Consistent with
that hypothesis, repeated attempts by our laboritories
and others to inactivate B. burgdorferi ebfC have been
unsuccessful (P. Stewart, personal communication), sug-
gesting that EbfC may be an essential borrelial protein.
Almost all components of the B. burgdorferi seg-
mented genome contain the same frequency of EbfC
consensus-binding sites, with a site approximately every
1100–1400 bp. The cp32 family members are distinctive
in having an EbfC-binding sequence every 630–650 bp.
The erp Operator 2 sites are unique in being the only
locations in B. burgdorferi where two GTnAC sites are
found in close proximity. The present studies demon-
strated that EbfC exhibits a greater aﬃnity for DNA
containing two GTnAC sites than for DNA with only
one site. Many bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins
inﬂuence gene transcription levels as consequences of the
locations of preferred binding sites relative to promoters
(43,44,53,54). Noting that ebfC transcription is linked to
that of DNA polymerase III subunits, and erp genes are
maximally expressed during periods of rapid bacterial
division, we hypothesize that cellular EbfC levels could
serve as a signal of bacterial replication rates to inﬂuence
expression of Erp lipoproteins. High-aﬃnity EbfC-
binding sequences are also scattered throughout the
B. burgdorferi genome. Although some sites have been
identiﬁed in close proximity to known transcriptional pro-
moters (55,56), the eﬀects of EbfC upon those genes
remain to be investigated.
In conclusion, B. burgdorferi EbfC possesses both
sequence-speciﬁc and sequence-independent DNA binding
activities. Genes orthologous to ebfC are found in the
genomes of a broad range of bacterial species, and the
orthologs of E. coli and H. inﬂuenzae are also DNA-
binding proteins (Cooley,A.E. et al., submitted for public-
tion). Thus, characterization of B. burgdorferi EbfC
impacts upon the entire kingdom Eubacteria. It also
appears that EbfC family members interact with DNA
through a unique fold, and represent a novel type of
DNA-binding protein.
