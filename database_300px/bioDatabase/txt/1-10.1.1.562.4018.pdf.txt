The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of drug resistance among isolates
of Acinetobacter baumannii from our Burn Intensive Care Unit (BICU), the rate of clinical
cure, and the mortality rate. We undertook a retrospective review of all cases of infection
from the BICU between January 2004 and November 2005. The group consisted of 24
men (80%) and 6 women with a mean age of 43 years (range, 17–76 years, 14.5 years).
Mean TBSA burned was 43% (range, 9–75%, 19%). Mean BICU length of stay was 49
days (range, 5–118 days, 30 days). Patients developed their first infection after a mean of
16 days (5–73 days, 14 days). The initial site of infection was bronchoalveolar lavage in
21 (70%), blood in 6 (20%), central venous catheter tip in 2 (7%), and urine in 1 (3%). The
isolates displayed resistance to imipenem in 87% of cases. No organism displayed resistance
to colistin (polymixin E). Patients were treated with colistin in 20 cases (67%), with amika-
cin in 8 cases (27%), and with imipenem in 2 cases (7%). A total of 10 patients (33%) died,
1 from gastrointestinal bleeding and 9 from active infection, giving an infection related
mortality of 30%. In 21 cases (70%), a cure was achieved with a mean duration of treatment
of 16 days (range, 4–30 days, 7 days). The majority of A. baumannii isolates were multi-
drug resistant; however, no isolate displayed resistance to colistin. Cure rate was 70% and
infection-related mortality reached 30%. More investigation is warranted to improve pre-
vention and to assess new therapeutic agents. (J Burn Care Res 2007;28:248–254)
Infection in the critically ill burned patient remains
one of the most important contributors to morbidity
and mortality. Despite advances in prevention, pro-
phylaxis, and seemingly adequate therapeutic regi-
mens, serious life-threatening infections still plague
the seriously burned patient during the critical phases
of recovery.1–5 The most frequently encountered in-
fections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia
(VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection, uri-
nary tract infection, and wound infections, are gen-
erally caused by known nosocomial pathogens, with
predictable drug sensitivities.2 However, time has
shown that the microbial environment of a critical
care unit is a dynamic and complex system, and the
most frequent pathogens are likely to change over
time, as well as their respective drug sensitivities.6
Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a new threat
to the burn patient population. Serious infections
from this previously benign organism are reported
with increasing frequency, and national infection sur-
veillance programs now recognize it as a major com-
ponent of nosocomial pathogens.6–11 Of additional
concern is the changing drug sensitivities, which now
display increasing drug resistance to conventional
therapeutic agents. After encountering multiple cases
of resistant Acenitobacter infection in the burn inten-

sive care unit (BICU) of our institution, we decided
to review our experience dealing with this organism.
The purpose of this study was to determine the inci-
dence of multidrug resistance (MDR) amongA. bau-
mannii isolates from our institution, the cure rate of
A. baumannii infection in critically ill burned pa-
tients, and the mortality associated with it. We de-
fined A. baumannii as being MDR when displaying
resistance to imipenem and one or more other drugs
to which the organism is historically know to be sen-
sitive. We also attempted to define the efficacy of the
specific drug regimens used.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective review of all cases ofA.
baumannii infection from the BICU of our institu-
tion between January 2004 and November 2005. All
documented infections during the study period were
reviewed. Microbiological reports, electronic notes
from the BICU attending, as well as laboratory data
were reviewed.
For each patient, the primary site of infection was
defined as the first positive culture forA. baumannii.
The time between BICU admission and the first pos-
itive culture and the time between culture acquisition
and initiation of adequate treatment was determined.
Because this study was retrospective, we could not
define strict clinical criteria that could be followed by
the treating physician to determine clinical cure and
end of treatment. In this context, we concluded that
when an attending note documented that culture-
directed treatment against A. baumannii was to be
stopped, the patient had sufficient clinical and/ormi-
crobiological evidence that cure was achieved. The
duration of treatment was recorded as well as the
specific agent chosen and the route of administration.
All-cause in-ICU and in-hospital mortality were re-
corded. We defined recurrent infection as a new pos-
itive culture at the initial site after a successful full
course of culture-directed antibiotic treatment. Anal-
ysis was performed using descriptive statistics includ-
ing means and standard deviations. Comparisons for
individual variables were performed using z-test for
proportions (Primer of Biostatistics, version 4.0,
copyright 1996, McGraw Hill, New York, NY) and
correlative analysis where appropriate. Univariate and
multivariate analysis (logistic regression) was per-
formed in an attempt to determine individual predic-
tors of the outcome measures while controlling for
potential confounders (NCSS 2004/PASS 2005,
Kaysville, UT).A P value.05 was considered signif-
icant.
RESULTS
We identified 35 patients that had a positive culture
with A. baumannii in the BICU during the study
period. Of these, we excluded 5 patients that har-
bored the organism on a single culture from the tip of
a removed central venous catheter, and no treatment
was deemed necessary in all cases. Two of those 5
patients died during the study period from noninfec-
tious causes (1 cardiac failure, 1multiple organ failure
[MOF] without sepsis). The remaining 30 patients
were included for analysis. The group consisted of 24
men (80%), with a mean age of 43 years (range,
17–76 years, 14.5 years). The mean TBSA burned
was 43% (range, 9–75%, 19%). The mean BICU
length of stay (LOS) was 49 days (range, 5–118 days,
30 days) and mean hospital LOS was 63 days (6–
140 days, 37 days). The patients developed their
first infection with A. baumannii after a mean of 16
days (range, 5–73 days, 14 days) in the BICU.
The initial site of infection was from bronchoalveo-
lar lavage (BAL) in 21 patients (70%), from blood in
6 patients (20%), from central venous catheter tip in 2
patients (7%), and from urine in 1 patient (3%). A
BAL was considered positive with greater than 104
colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, a blood culture
when any growth was reported, a central venous cath-
eter tip infection when greater than 15 CFU were
present, and a urinary tract infection when greater
than 105CFU/ml of the organismwas observed. The
initial positive culture was polymicrobial in 17 cases of
the 21 BAL (81%), with gram-positive organisms in 9
cases (6 oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 1 Strepto-
coccus pneumoniae), and gram-negative organisms in 8
cases (3Pseudomonas aeruginos a, 3Enterobacteriacea, 1
Proteus mirabilis, and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pa-
tients had a positive culture withA. baumannii at more
than one site during their BICU stay in 20 cases (67%).
The isolates displayed resistance to minocycline in
37% of cases, to amikacin in 63% of cases, to tobra-
mycin in 80% of cases, and to imipenem in 87% of
cases. Defining MDR as resistance to imipenem and
one ormore other drug tested, we found an incidence
of 87% of MDR among the isolates of A. baumannii
recovered. No organism displayed resistance to colis-
tin. Patients were treated with colistin in 20 cases
(67%), receiving the intravenous form in 9 cases
(45%) and the nebulized form in 11 cases (55%). The
intravenous dose was 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, ad-
justed to 2mg/kg every 24 hours for creatinine clear-
ance of 10 to 50 ml/min and to 2 mg/kg every 36
hours for creatinine clearance of less than 10ml/min.
Patients being dialyzed received 1 mg/kg after dialysis.

We did not perform routine monitoring of the drug
level. In the nebulized colistin group, the dosage used
was 75 mg nebulized every 12 hours. The most fre-
quent adverse events related to colistin are renal fail-
ure for the intravenous form and bronchorrea for the
nebulized form. These events were not uniformly
measured and, with the small number of patients in
this study, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding
adverse events with colistin use. In nine cases, a com-
bination of drugs were used based on drug sensitivi-
ties. Each of these nine cases had colistin and a second
antibiotic (either minocycline, doxycyline, or amika-
cin). The remaining patients received amikacin alone
in 8 cases (27%) and imipenem alone in 2 cases (7%).
In 21 cases (70%), clinical cure was achieved during
their BICU stay, with a mean duration of treatment
of 16 days (range, 4–30 days, 7 days). Only three
cases developed recurrent infection after a successful
initial course of treatment.
A total of 10 patients (33%) died during their
BICU stay, 1 from gastrointestinal bleeding and 9
from active infection creating septic shock andMOF,
for an infection-related mortality of 30%. In the pa-
tients infected with the imipenem-sensitive organism,

one died (25%) and, in the MDR group, we found
nine deaths, one from the gastrointestinal bleeding
and eight from sepsis and MOF (31%).We found no
significant differences between survivors and nonsur-
vivors in TBSA, time in BICU before development of
infection, site of initial, infection, pattern of resistance
(MDR or non-MDR), duration of treatment, or time
between obtaining the culture and initiation of treat-
ment. However, patients in the nonsurvivor group
were significantly older (49 vs 40 years, respectively,
P  .025; Table 1). Multivariate regression did not
reveal any independent predictors of survival, likely as
a result of the small sample size.
One of the nonsurvivors deserves particular men-
tion. The patient was a 41-year-old man who devel-
oped progressive cardiac failure in a septic context,
with synchronous arythmias but without evidence of
myocardial ischemia. His workup included transoe-
sophageal echocardiography on two occasions, use of
pulmonary artery catheter, and conventional tools for
coronary artery disease and myocardial ischemia eval-
uation (electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes). They
revealed decreased cardiac output, global hypokine-
sia, small pericardial effusion, and no evidence of isch-
emia. The patient eventually died, and autopsy re-
vealed the presence of a 95% stenosis of the left
anterior descending artery and purulent bacterial
pericarditis caused by a gram-negative organism,
most likely A. baumannii because the patient was
growing the organism repeatedly in his cultures. Un-
fortunately, no culture was sent by the medical exam-
iner at the time of autopsy.12 This demonstrates the
potential ability of this very resistant organism to mi-
grate to atypical clinical sites of infection.
DISCUSSION
Acinetobacter strains are nonfermenting aerobic gram-
negative coccobacillary organisms, usually demonstrat-
ing diploid formations or chains. They can be found in
soil and water as free-living saprophytes and are occa-
sionally found colonizing skin, aero-digestive mucosa,
and the gastrointestinal tract.13 Twenty-one DNA ho-
mology groups have been described based on DNA-
DNA relationships within the Acinetobacter genus.14
Different species of the genus are predominant in
different environments, andA. baumannii is the spe-
cies most frequently encountered in the hospital set-
ting.
In themedical environment, the organism has been
cultured from multiple sources in either surveillance
programs or investigation of epidemic outbreaks. A.
baumannii has been found on inanimate surfaces
such as pillows, bed mattresses, curtains, door han-
dles, and computer keyboards, even after cleaning
with antiseptic solutions.15–18 It seems that the or-
ganism also prefers warm and moist environments,
and it has been found on respiratory equipment, hu-
midifiers, and sinks.19 However, the capacity ofAcin-
etobacter to survive on dry surfaces and to sustain
dessication has also been demonstrated.17,18 Health
care workers in contact with infected patients also
have been shown to harbor the organisms on their
hands and play a potential role in epidemic outbreaks
through contamination of the environment and other
patients.16
Numerous studies have attempted to identify po-
tential risk factors predisposing to the nosocomial
acquisition of A. baumannii.Most were retrospec-
tive studies and used univariate analysis. The most
frequently identified risk factors were malignancy,20
APACHE II score,20,21 mechanical ventilation,20,22–25
prior use of antibiotics, and placement of intravascu-
lar catheters20,22–24 among others. By multivariate
analysis, severity of illness, burns, mechanical ventila-
tion, male sex, duration of ICU stay before infection,
and use of third-generation cephalosporins were
found to be independent risk factors for acquisition of
A. baumannii infection.20,23,24 In the present study,
we unfortunately did not obtain data from all patients
admitted to the BICU that would have allowed us to
identify risk factors for the acquisition of the infec-
tion.
In early in vitro studies, the vast majority of Acin-
etobacter isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, cepha-
losporins, and aminoglycosides.26–28 Clearly, how-
ever, the resistance patterns have changed with the
increased prevalence of infection and antibiotic use.
In 1995, Lyytikainen et al15 described their experi-
ence during the course of 4 years (1989–1993) and
found the resistance to imipenem increased from
1.5% to 7% and resistance to tobramycin increased
from 5% to 12%.15 Others have reported imipenem
resistance in the range of 11% to 24% from more
recently published data (2003–2005).20 In the report
byHanberger in 1999 analyzingmicrobiological data
from 5 European countries, Acinetobacter species
were found to have the highest increase in resistance
to antibiotics of all the gram-negative bacilli stud-
ied.11 The report from Paul and colleagues from Is-
rael found an increase in resistance to imipenem from
10% to 34% between 1997 and 2002.9
In our series, A. baumannii isolates displayed a
much higher incidence of resistance to imipenem
(87%). The explanation may lie in the frequent use of
imipenem or piperacillin as the empiric regimen used
for suspected gram-negative coverage in our institu-
tion. Weinbren and colleagues suggested that the use
Journal of Burn Care & Research
Volume 28, Number 2 Trottier et al 251
of carbapenems in their BICU could be responsible
for an increase in drug resistance, as they observed a
significant increase (four to eightfold) in the minimal
inhibitory concentration of imipenem for their Acin-
etobacter isolates under a policy of using meropenem
for suspected gram-negative infections.29 In contrast,
LeFloch et al30 described using a systematic antibiotic
regimen composed of imipenem and tobramycin for
suspected gram-negative infections. They found the
incidence of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas had de-
creased, but incidence of Enterobacter and Klebsiella
as well as resistance to ticarcillin had increased.
With increasing drug resistance, clinicians are faced
with difficult decisions regarding therapeutic choices.
Colistin has been reintroduced as a treatment option,
and a few published reports have described its use in
cases ofAcinetobacter and Pseudomonas infections.31–38
However, the use of colistin in a nebulized form has
been published more scarcely.33,39 Interestingly, we
did not encounter resistance to colistin in any of our
isolates. We used a daily dose of 4 mg/kg of colistin
intravenously divided in two doses for the patients
with normal renal function. The recommended dose
is 2 to 5 mg/kg daily, divided in two doses, depend-
ing on the severity of the infection. We did not mon-
itor for the drug levels, and the dose was adjusted to
renal clearance in case of renal failure. The nebulized
form was reserved for patients with isolated VAP and
no evidence of bloodstream infection. In the burn
population, published experience with colistin and
evaluation of the pharmacokinetics is still lacking. Fu-
ture development of our own experience will have to
include research on the kinetics of the drug in our
burn population and tissue levels measurement in
wounds, blood and alveoli.
Newer agents have been recently introduced, in-
cluding tigecycline, a glycylcycline, which shows in
vitro and in vivo activity againstA. baumannii.40 This
agent is presently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for skin and skin-structures infections
as well as complicated intra-abdominal infections.
More research is required to address the efficacy of
this new agent in cases of nosocomial A. baumannii
infection in ICUs. Nevertheless, it appears to be a
promising option at this time.
The infection related mortality in our group was
30%, and we found similar rates in the recent litera-
ture. Bang et al41 found a 30%mortality in their 1998
report. Sengupta et al42 found a 38% mortality rate in
their unit in 2001. Wisplinghoff et al43 found a 31%
total mortality rate in their group in 1999, but the
infection related mortality rate was lower (7%). This
lower rate of mortality may be related to the fact that
all isolates in the study by Wisplinghoff were suscep-
tible to imipenem, whereas most of our isolates were
resistant to imipenem.However, our small number of
patients prevents us from identifying a significant dif-
ference in outcome between patients infected with
the resistant and the susceptible strains. Two recent
reports looked at the morbidity related to A. bau-
mannii infection. Wilson et al44 found that patients
in their burn unit who developed a A. baumannii
infection had a significantly higher mean hospital cost
of $98,575 per patient when compared with matched
controls. Wong et al45 foundA. baumannii infection
to be an independent risk factor for increased length
of stay in the BICU in their retrospective analysis
published in 2002.
All our cases of infection with A. baumannii were
nosocomial. This pathogen has become endemic to
the trauma intensive care unit of our institution,
which shares a geographically adjacent space with the
burn ICU. In the last 3 years, this pathogen has be-
come encountered more frequently in the BICU as
well as in the surgical ICU, and the study was aimed
at acquiring further knowledge of the infection. Pre-
ventive measures have been put in place by the infec-
tion control department of our institution consisting
of contact precautions for known cases, isolation of
cases, education of healthcare workers to preventive
measures, distribution of personal-size hand disinfec-
tant to workers, and monitoring of new cases. Envi-
ronmental measures also have been applied with in-
stallation of plastic curtains that can be cleaned with
bactericidal solutions. Despite these measures imple-
mented before and throughout the study period, the
number of new cases found monthly has not declined
and only stayed stable.A. baumannii is now the most
frequently cultured gram-negative pathogen found
both in the trauma ICU and the BICU of our in-
stitution. Further work is required in identifying
strategies to reduce the number of new cases and to
decontaminate our environment. A prospective ob-
servational study is presently underway in our institu-
tion to help identify the incidence ofMDR organisms
carriage in the population served by our resources. All
trauma and burned patients admitted have stool sam-
ples collected upon admission and in the following
weeks when hospitalized. We aim at finding the inci-
dence of carriage and hopefully acquire data that
could be correlated to clinical infections during their
hospitalization.
CONCLUSION
We found an important number of A. baumannii
infections in our BICU population during the 2-year
duration of our study. The isolates showed resistance

to imipenem in 87% of cases but not to colistin. Mor-
tality in this group of patient was high (30%). With
increasing numbers of cases and increased resistance
to antibiotics, it is now even more important to in-
vestigate and improve the prevention and treatment
of this life-threatening organism.
