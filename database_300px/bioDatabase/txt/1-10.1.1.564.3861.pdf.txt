Food deprivation results in metabolic, structural, and functional changes in the small intestine that
influences gut mucosal integrity, epithelial cell proliferation, mucin synthesis, and other processes.
The underlying mechanisms are still unclear, which lead to the study of molecular effects of short-
term and long-term starvation in the intestine of mice. A comparative proteomics approach, combining
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry, was used to identify intestinal proteins whose expression is changed under different
starvation conditions (0, 12, 24, and 72 h). In total, the expression levels of 80 protein spots changed
significantly between the different groups. The results demonstrate that after 12 h of starvation, mainly
proteins involved in glycolysis and energy metabolism show decreased expression levels. Starvation
for 24 h results in a down-regulation of proteins involved in protein synthesis and amino acid
metabolism. Simultaneously, proteins with a protective role, e.g., reg I and II, glutathione peroxidase
3, and carbonic anhydrase 3, are clearly up-regulated. The last starvation phase (72 h) is characterized
by increased ezrin expression, which may enhance villus morphogenesis critical for survival. Together,
these results provide novel insights in the intestinal starvation response and may contribute to improved
nutritional support during conditions characterized by malnutrition.

Introduction
Alterations in nutritional status have an impact on metabolic
pathways in the human body. Malnutrition and starvation
generate a number of adaptive biochemical, physiological, and
molecular responses that lead to a reduction in body weight
and visceral organ mass, immune dysfunction, inhibition of
reproduction, etc. According to the main energy sources
available and the associated loss in body weight, the starvation
response in mammals is characterized by consecutive phases.
Phase I is the postabsorptive phase characterized by glyco-
genolysis. During phase II, energy requirements are mostly
derived from fat oxidation leading to depletion of lipid stores.
Phase III is characterized by increased protein utilization as a
substitute fuel.1
The small intestine, the primary organ for nutrient diges-
tion and absorption, undergoes dramatic structural and func-
tional changes when deprived of food. Adaptive mechanisms
following starvation influence gut mucosal integrity leading
to increased mucosal permeability.2 Other processes such
as epithelial cell proliferation and mucin synthesis are in-
hibited, and apoptosis is induced, however this seems to be
dependent on the length of the starvation period.3-5 Food
intake regulates gastrointestinal hormones that are important
for growth and repair, including gastrin, epidermal growth
factor, and insulin-like growth factor-I, which interact with gut
mucosal receptors to stimulate regeneration and function of
enterocytes.6
Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects
of food deprivation in the intestine are unclear. Hence, we used
a proteomics approach to determine starvation-induced ad-
aptations at the molecular level and to discriminate between
the effects of short-term (12 h) and long-term starvation (24
and 72 h) on the mouse intestine. In mice, glycogen stores are
maximally reduced after 12 h of starvation, which should
correspond to a shift from phase I to II.7 The transition between
phase II and III occurs probably after 48 h of fasting.1 A further
understanding of molecular adaptive responses to food restric-
tion in the intestine may lead to an improved nutritional
support in conditions characterized by starvation and malnu-
trition, such as critical illness, surgery, sepsis, cancer, anorexia
nervosa, and malabsorption syndromes.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Zirkonia-Silica beads (2.5 mm) were from BioSpec
Products (Bartlesville, OK, USA). CHAPS, DTT, goat anti-rabbit
Ig-alkaline phosphatase, and levamisole (Tetramisolehydro-
chloride) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). NBT/BCIP
solution was from Roche Applied Science (Penzberg, Germany).
Urea and SYPRO Ruby Protein Stain were from Bio-Rad
Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Immobilized pH gradient (IPG)
strips (pH 3-11, nonlinear), IPG buffer, and a 2-D Clean-Up
kit were from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, England).
Animals and Tissue Collection. Male FVB mice, obtained
from Charles River (Maastricht, The Netherlands), were housed
per two in cages under controlled environmental conditions
(12-h light period, temperature of 20-22 °C, 50-60% humidity).
They had free access to food and water until six weeks of age.
At that time point, six mice per group were fasted for 0, 12, 24,
or 72 h. The 72-h-starved animals were housed in metabolic
cages and were kept warm with an infrared lamp.
Animals were killed by cervical dislocation. The small
intestine was removed immediately and made free of mesen-
tery, pancreas, and fat. Proximal and distal parts of the small
intestine were opened longitudinally, washed with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), and blotted dry. Tissues were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.
The study was approved by the Animal Experiments Com-
mittee from the Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam, The
Netherlands) and was performed in accordance with the Dutch
guidelines for the use of experimental animals.
Protein Sample Preparation. Equal quantities of proximal
and distal parts of the intestine were pooled per mouse. Tissue
samples were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 6 M urea,
2 M thiourea, 30 mM DTT, 4% w/v CHAPS with a Biospec Mini-
beadbeater and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 30 min at 10 °C. A
2-D clean-up kit was used to remove nonprotein contaminants
of supernatants. Protein pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer
containing 0.5% v/v IPG buffer (pH 3-10, nonlinear). After
centrifuging protein samples at 8000 g for 10 min at 10 °C,
supernatants were stored at -80 °C until further analysis.
Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford-based
protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories).8
Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2-DE). The 2-DE
procedure was performed as described.9 Briefly, 100 íg of total
protein was separated by isoelectric focusing using IPG strips
(24 cm, pH 3-11, nonlinear) according to the following
protocol: 12 h at 30 V, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, 3 h gradient
from 1000 to 8000 V, 30 kVh at 8000 V. Strips were equilibrated
and placed onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for protein
separation in the second dimension. Gels were stained with
SYPRO Ruby Protein Stain, and proteins were visualized by
scanning gels with the Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories). To reduce technical variability, 12 IPG strips and 12 gels
were run simultaneously using an IPGphor isoelectric focusing
system (Amersham Biosciences) and a Protean Dodeca Cell
electrophoresis chamber (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The six bio-
logical replicates per condition were evenly distributed between
the two runs.
Image Analysis. Examination of differentially expressed
proteins was performed using PDQuest 7.3 (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories). Gels from samples with the same treatment formed one
replicate group with average normalized spot intensities. A spot
was regarded as significantly differentially expressed between
groups (0, 12, 24, and 72 h starvation) if the average spot
intensity differed 2-fold or more and if p < 0.05 (Student’s
t-test) for at least one comparison. Changed spots were excised
from the gels with a Spot Cutter (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight
Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and Protein Identifica-
tion. Excised protein spots were subjected to tryptic in-gel
digestion and MALDI-TOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK),
generating peptide mass fingerprints with MassLynx 4.0.5
(Waters) as described.10 Protein identification was performed
as described.9 Taxonomy was set to Mus musculus, and Mascot
probability scores (http://www.matrixscience.com) were cal-
culated using 30 mass peaks or less with the highest signal
intensity; trypsin and keratin peaks were excluded. Protein
identifications with a score greater than 54 and at least four
matched peptides were considered significant (p < 0.05).
Data Analysis. GenMAPP and MAPPFinder (version 2.0)
(Gladstone Institute, San Fransisco, CA) were used to analyze
data of identified changed protein spots in response to starva-
tion and to explore biological processes altered at the protein
level under these conditions.11,12
Immunohistochemistry. Intestinal samples, fixed overnight
in 4% formaldehyde, were embedded in paraffin, sectioned
at 6 ím, and stained immunohistochemically according to
the following procedure. The slides were boiled in 10 mM
Na-citrate (pH 6.0) for 10 min to retrieve epitopes and
inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase and blocked for
30 min at room temperature in Teng-T (10 mM TrisHCl with
pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% w/v gelatin, and
0.05 v/v Tween-20) containing 10% normal goat serum (NGS).
Subsequently, the slides were incubated overnight with the
polyclonal anti-ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) antibody
(kindly provided by dr. T. Matsuzawa13) diluted in Teng-T/
10%NGS. Sections were thoroughly washed in PBS and incu-
bated with goat anti-rabbit Ig-alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:40
in Teng-T/10%NGS. Antibody-bound alkaline phosphatase
activity was visualized by incubation in NBT/BCIP solution
1:50 in 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2,
1 mM levamisole for 30 min.
Results
Starvation-Induced Effects on the Proteome of Mice In-
testine. Male FVB mice were deprived of food for 0, 12, 24, or
72 h, and changes in the protein profiles were determined by
a 2-DE approach. Approximately 1500 spots were detected per
gel within a pH range of 3-11 and a molecular mass range of
10-100 kDa. Differentially expressed protein spots (73) (g2-
fold change, p < 0.05) were found when 2-D patterns of the
control group (0 h starvation) were compared to 2-D patterns
of the experimental groups (12, 24, or 72 h starvation). Figure
1 shows the number of changed protein spots per time point.
Compared to the fed condition, 36, 58, and 27 protein spots
were changed at 12, 24, and 72 h of fasting, respectively.
Comparing the three experimental groups with each other
resulted in 7 additional changed protein spots.
Differentially expressed proteins (62 of the 80) were identified
with MALDI-TOF MS corresponding to 46 unique protein
entries, as some proteins were present as more than one spot
due to protein processing or modification. Figure 2 shows a
representative 2-D gel indicating the identified protein spots.
A list of the same proteins together with their change in
expression during starvation is displayed in Table 1.
Biological Pathways Changed during Starvation. Data of
differentially expressed protein spots were analyzed using
research articles Lenaerts et al.
2114 Journal of Proteome Research ¥ Vol. 5, No. 9, 2006
GenMAPP and MAPPFinder software to explore biological
processes which are changed during starvation. Results ob-
tained for the “local MAPPS” in GenMAPP point to the
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway. In total, six proteins
(represented by eight protein spots) of this pathway signifi-
cantly changed their expression levels in response to starvation
(Figure 3).
Most of these protein spots showed decreased expression
levels during starvation compared to the fed condition, and
they were identified as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate
mutase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, and cytoplasmic malate
dehydrogenase. Triosephosphate isomerase displayed an in-
creased expression level during starvation. Another protein spot
identified as triosephosphate isomerase showed a decrease in
expression levels after 12 and 24 h, but only for 1.6- and 1.9-
fold (p < 0.05), respectively (data not shown).
Functional Characteristics of Proteins with Changed Ex-
pression Levels during Different Phases of Starvation. Next
to glycolysis proteins, we found other proteins that differed in
expression level after a certain starvation period. These are
grouped according to their functional characteristics (spot
mixtures with two identified proteins are excluded). Data of
mRNA levels (mentioned below) are available for several
changed proteins and these data were obtained by microarray
technology as described by Sokolovic´ et al. (submitted).
Proteins Involved in Energy Metabolism. Expression levels
of ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex core protein I,
ATP synthase beta chain, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, and
creatine kinase B were reduced in response to a 12-h fasting
period. A C-terminal part of the ATP synthase beta chain was
up-regulated in response to fasting at all time points.
Alcohol-Metabolizing Enzymes. Alcohol dehydrogenase
[NADP+] and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member B1
showed reduced expression levels after 12 h of fasting.

Protein Folding and Processing. After 12 and 24 h of
starvation, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (N-terminal
part) and protein disulfide-isomerase (C-terminal part) were
up-regulated. Full-length peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cis-trans
isomerase A was decreased (p < 0.05) after 24 and 72 h of
starvation but not 2-fold (data not shown). Calreticulin (spot
2, Figure 2, Table 1) was up-regulated upon starvation for 12
and 24 h. Another spot identified as the same protein (spot 1,
Figure 2, Table 1) was down-regulated after 72 h. Microarray
data showed comparable findings for calreticulin mRNA that
was up-regulated after 12 h of starvation and down-regulated
after 72 h of starvation. After 24 and 72 h of starvation,
T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha B showed increased expres-
sion levels. Heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (N-terminal
part) was up-regulated after 72 h of starvation.
Proteins Involved in Protein Synthesis. Elongation factor
1-beta and 2 (EF-1-beta and EF-2) showed decreased expres-
sion levels upon 24 h of starvation, EF-2 remained down-
regulated after 72 h of starvation (see Figure 4). EF-2 mRNA
levels were shown to be increased at all time points of
starvation. The discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels
of EF-2 was already demonstrated before in liver and muscle
of 48-h-starved mice.14
Proteins Involved in Amino Acid Metabolism. Expression
levels of OAT and its C-terminal part were reduced after 24
and 72 h of starvation. This finding was confirmed with
immunohistochemical staining of OAT protein in intestinal
sections after 0 and 72 h of starvation. OAT levels are clearly
reduced after starvation, especially at the tips of the villi (Figure
5). Microarray data showed also a down-regulation of OAT
mRNA levels after 12, 24, and 72 h of starvation of 2.4-, 1.5-,
and 4.1-fold, respectively. For arginase-2, a 2-fold significant
increase (p ) 0.020) was found comparing the 72-h-starved
group with the 12-h-starved group.
Proteins with a Role in the Extracellular Space. Glutathione
peroxidase 3 (GPx-3) protein expression was gradually in-
creased with prolonged fasting periods (significant from 24 h),
whereas mRNA levels were increased after 12 and 24 h (2.3-
and 1.7-fold, respectively). Lithostathine 1 and 2 were strongly
up-regulated after 24 h of fasting. They remained up-regulated
after 72 h of fasting (see Figure 6). Expression levels of
pancreatic alpha-amylase (N-terminal part) were also increased
compared to control levels (spot 51 after 24 h and spot 40 after
72 h, Figure 2, Table 1). Proteins with significantly decreased
expression levels upon starvation are anterior gradient protein
2 homolog (after 12 and 24 h) and intelectin-1a (after 24 and
72 h). Fragments of serum albumin were up-regulated (spot
18, all time points; spot 13, 12, and 24 h).
Cytoskeleton-Related Proteins. Expression levels of desmin,
transgelin, villin-1 (C-terminal part), and rho GDP-dissociation
inhibitor 1 decreased after 24 h of starvation whereas ezrin was
up-regulated after 72 h of starvation. Cytoplasmic actin was
down-regulated after 72 h of starvation whereas its C-ter-
minal part was up-regulated after 24 and 72 h of starva-
tion. Gamma-enteric smooth muscle actin (N-terminal part)
was up-regulated and full-length keratin type I cytoskeletal 19
and type II cytoskeletal 8 were down-regulated in response to
starvation.
Ungrouped Proteins. Proteins down-regulated upon 24 h
of starvation are intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and sul-
fotransferase family cytosolic 1B member 1. Fumarylacetoace-
tate hydrolase domain-containing protein 1 was down-reg-
ulated after both 12 and 24 h of fasting. After 24 and 72 h of
fasting, protein levels of proteasome subunit alpha type 1 and
the N-terminal part of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleopro-
teins A2/B1 were decreased and levels of carbonic anhydrase
3 was increased. Guanine deaminase showed reduced expres-
sion levels during the whole starvation period.
Discussion
The gastrointestinal tract is a metabolically active organ
consuming considerable amounts of energy.15 When food
supply, and thereby energy supply, is restricted, structural and
functional changes occur rapidly and energy-saving mecha-
nisms are initiated resulting in a decline in metabolism.1 It was
shown, however, that the basic morphology of the mouse
intestine remained unaffected, even after 72 h of starvation.
The enterocytes and the smooth muscle cells represented
approximately 71 and 24% of the intestinal tissue, respectively.
Goblet cells were also visualized, and none of the mentioned
cell types showed a significant change in its contribution to
the entire small intestine during fasting (Sokolovic´ et al.,
submitted).
Using a proteomics approach, we showed here that early in
the starvation period several proteins involved in glycolysis are
down-regulated. This is in agreement with starvation-induced
decreases in the activity of some glycolytic and citric acid-cycle
enzymes in the intestine.16 Furthermore, the down-regulation
of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and aldolase B
can be explained by lysosomal proteolysis as both are sub-
strates for chaperone-mediated autophagy, a process activated
during nutrient limitation,17 and probably also during starva-
tion. We speculate that the reduction in the level of glycolytic
enzymes is a direct effect of the diminished glucose supply to
the intestine.
Another mechanism involved in energy supply is ATP
generation via oxidative phosphorylation. First, ubiquinol-
cytochrome-c reductase complex core protein I, a constituent
of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III, and
ATP synthase beta chain, a subunit of the catalytic portion F1
of the ATP synthase complex, are more than 2-fold reduced.

complexes I, III, and IV of the respiratory chain is coupled to
the synthesis of ATP. Mitochondrial ATP synthase catalyzes the
ATP synthesis in the presence of a proton gradient across the
inner mitochondrial membrane. Thus, the observed changes
in protein expression in response to fasting indicate a decrease
in ATP synthesis. A similar process has been described in the
liver of 18-h-starved rats, where a 40% decrease in expression
of the beta-F1 subunit of ATP synthase was shown.18 Finally, a
reduced expression level of creatine kinase B-type was observed
in the early phase of the starvation response. This enzyme
catalyzes the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP forming
phosphocreatine and ADP and plays a significant role in energy
homeostasis of cells. As the ATP levels decrease, no excess ATP
is available to be stored as phosphocreatine and consequently
the enzyme levels decrease.
Another protein with reduced expression levels after 12 h of
starvation is anterior gradient protein 2 homolog, also known
as AG-2 or gob-4 protein, which is expressed in the goblet cells
of the intestine. Goblet cells secrete mucus that covers the
absorptive surface of the intestine, and gob-4 protein is
suggested to have a role in the mucus-secreting function.19 The
mucus layer acts as a barrier between the luminal contents and
the absorptive cells of the intestine and comprises the first line
defense against exogenous or endogenous luminal pathogens
and irritants. Hence, decreases in proteins involved in this
mucus secretion, like gob-4 expression during fasting, could
have adverse effects on the intestinal mucus layer and its
protective function.
Fragments of serum albumin are increased in response to
starvation. Albumin is known to be synthesized by the liver;
however, a recent study showed that nonhepatic tissues have
also this capacity and that albumin is expressed in the intestine
of bovine.20 Accordingly, intestinal albumin synthesis may be
up-regulated when mice are subjected to starvation. Although,
another explanation may be an increase in serum albumin
catabolism, because only fragments of this protein were up-
regulated.21
In the subsequent phase of starvation (24 h), the change in
protein expression particularly directs to protein and amino
acid metabolism and cellular protection mechanisms. We
observed a down-regulation of two key players involved in
protein translation, EF-1-beta and EF-2, which suggests inhibi-
tion of protein synthesis during starvation.22 Translation re-
quires high amounts of metabolic energy and a known regu-
latory pathway inhibiting this process is via ATP depletion
associated with fasting, resulting in an increased AMP/ATP ratio
which consecutively results in AMPK activation. AMPK directly
phosphorylates EF-2 kinase, which in turn inactivates EF-2 by
phosphorylation.23 In this manner, AMPK and EF-2 kinase may
provide an important link between cellular energy status and
the inhibition of protein synthesis, which seems a reasonable
way to preserve energy during starvation.

In response to a 24-h-starvation period, we also found a
down-regulation of nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, which
suggests a decrease of synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates
other than ATP, such as GTP, that is involved in many
metabolic and cellular processes such as protein synthesis and
G-protein signaling.24
With respect to amino acid metabolism, OAT was found to
be down-regulated. This key enzyme is present predominantly
in the small intestine and is involved in the conversion of
glutamine to ornithine. Ornithine is a precursor for polyamines,
known for their involvement in cell proliferation, cell dif-
ferentiation, and repair for intestinal cells.25 The decrease of
this ornithine-synthesizing protein might be a glutamine-
preserving mechanism, which adversely affects the intestinal
integrity during starvation. Although arginase-2 is not differ-
entially expressed in the 24-h-starvation response, the protein
is discussed here because of its role in ornithine metabolism.
The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine
and urea and is highly expressed in the small intestine of mice.
It is co-localized with OAT and ornithine decarboxylase,
suggesting a role in the synthesis of proline and polyamines.26
Arginase-2 shows a biphasic response, and the levels gradually
increase in the period after 12 h of starvation. This might be a
secondary response to the decreased OAT levels, which restores
ornithine concentrations in the intestinal cells.
With respect to cellular protection, we observed a gradual
increase of GPx-3 protein expression associated with increasing
fasting times (24 and 72 h). This protein is responsible for the
protection of cells against oxidative damage by catalyzing the
reduction of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides by glu-
tathione and is an important reactive oxygen species scaveng-
ing enzyme. The mouse small intestinal epithelial cells syn-
thesize GPx-3 and secrete it in the extracellular space.27 Higher
levels of oxidized glutathione were detected in the gut mucosa
of 72-h-starved rats compared to controls, resulting from
starvation-induced oxidative stress.2 Another up-regulated
protein with a role in oxidative stress handling is carbonic
anhydrase 3.28 Up-regulating the expression of GPx-3 and
carbonic anhydrase 3 in the small intestine coinciding pro-
longed fasting could play a role in the local antioxidant defense
of intestinal cells.
Our data suggest that cellular protection coincides with
preservation of intestinal integrity during later phases of
starvation, as lithostathine 1 and 2 (also called reg I and reg II)
are strongly up-regulated after 24 h starvation. They belong to
the regenerating gene (reg) family within the superfamily of
C-type lectin. The regeneration of pancreatic beta-cells seems
to be mainly regulated by the expression of the reg I gene and
led to the protein name “reg protein”.29 More research sup-
ported the hypothesis that reg protein has a trophic effect on
islet cells.30 In the rat stomach reg protein has been localized
mainly in enterochromaffin-like cells. Levels are increased
during regeneration of gastric mucosal cells, and the protein
has a trophic effect on gastric epithelial cells.31,32 The reg protein
is expressed in human small intestinal cells localized in the
crypts of Lieberkuhn and not in mature villous cells.33 There-
fore, reg protein may be associated with growth and could have
a role early in the differentiating process of intestinal epithe-
lium.34 The protein acts as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor
for beta-cell regeneration via a cell surface reg receptor, and
this receptor is also found in the gastric fundic mucosa and
many more tissues of rat, including the small intestine.35,36
Several factors have been shown to enhance reg gene expres-
sion, for example gastrin in normal gastric mucosa and
proinflammatory cytokines after gastric mucosal injury.32,37 Reg
II has only been described in mice.38 We now identified
Figure 6. (A) Examples of differentially expressed protein spots (spot 56 and 62 in Figure 2). Both spots, identified as lithostathine 2
(reg II) and 1 (reg I), respectively, show a strong increase in intensity after 24 h of starvation, which remains significant after 72 h of
starvation. (B) Graphical presentation of the expression patterns of spots depicted in A. The relative spot intensity of the control condition

starvation as a potent inducer of reg I and reg II protein
expression and postulate a protective effect of these proteins
in the fasting gut.
Intelectin and some cytoskeleton-related proteins are down-
regulated upon starvation and may be involved in the detri-
mental effects of fasting. Intelectin is a member of the lectin
family and is expressed in the small intestine, colon, heart, and
thymus. In the small intestine, the expression of intelectin is
restricted to the Paneth cells that are located in the lowest
region of the crypts and may play a role in the defense against
microorganisms.39 Human intelectin has been proposed to play
a role in the innate immune response to microbes containing
the bacterium-specific carbohydrate galactofuranose.40 A de-
creased intelectin expression, accompanied with starvation,
may count partly for the increased susceptibility to infections
during such stressful conditions.41
Expression of ezrin, a component of the microvilli of intesti-
nal epithelial cells, is induced by prolonged starvation (72 h).
Ezrin-deficient mice revealed that ezrin functions to organize
the apical terminal web and associated apical junctions that
mediate cell-cell communication during villus morphogenesis.
This leads to incomplete villus segregation and abnormal villus
morphology.42 The up-regulation of ezrin in the last starvation
phase (phase III) might be an adaptive response to sustain villus
function. In that phase of the starvation, an increase in mucosal
mass and a decrease in apoptosis is observed in rats.5 It is
hypothesized to be a reaction to permit rapid food assimilation
immediately after refeeding and thus, the restoration of the
whole body condition.5 This might be essential for survival
since animals have reached a critical depletion level in their
lipid reserves and body proteins.
Conclusion
Our results point to an adaptation of the intestine to the
absence of nutrients supply during the early phase of starvation.
In the first 12 h, mainly proteins involved in glycolysis and
energy metabolism are decreased. This is followed by a down-
regulation of proteins involved in protein synthesis and amino
acid metabolism during 24 h. Simultaneously, the stressful
conditions in the intestine seems counteracted by up-regulation
of proteins with a protective role such as reg I and II, GPx-3,
and carbonic anhydrase 3. The last starvation phase is char-
acterized by increased ezrin expression, which may enhance
villus morphogenesis critical for survival. In conclusion, our
results contribute to a further understanding of the molecular
events in the mouse intestine during starvation. This may
benefit nutritional support during conditions characterized by
malnutrition.
