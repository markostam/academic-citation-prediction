ABSTRACT
The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/ols) provides interactive and program-
matic interfaces to query, browse and navigate an
ever increasing number of biomedical ontologies
and controlled vocabularies. The volume of data
available for querying has more than quadrupled
since it went into production and OLS functionality
has been integrated into several high-usage data-
bases and data entry tools. Improvements have
been made to both OLS query interfaces, based on
user feedback and requirements, to improve usabil-
ity and service interoperability and provide novel
ways to perform queries.
INTRODUCTION
The current trend towards multi-domain data analysis,
compounded with the vast amounts of data being gene-
rated by high-throughput methods, presents a signiﬁcant
data management challenge. Controlled vocabularies and
ontologies therefore become crucial tools for data anno-
tation and analysis to help provide a stable and consistent
context for large data sets.
The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) was created to
provide a simple, centralized, integrated interface to query
multiple biomedical ontologies by interactive and pro-
grammatic means. Prior to its creation, users wishing to
query ontologies had to go to individual websites—when
available—and use whatever query interface was made
available. Many ontologies were only available in ﬂat-ﬁle
format and few ontologies could be queried by program-
matic means. Querying multiple ontologies was a diﬃcult
and time-consuming proposition.
The OLS has been in production since mid-2005 and
has proven to be a popular tool with data producers
and consumers. The OLS has been previously described
and readers are invited to refer to the original publication
for in-depth information on the technical architecture and
data models (1).
The core functionality of the OLS provides users with
the means to perform queries on controlled vocabulary
and ontology terms and synonyms, as well as navigate the
relationships between terms and obtain additional meta-
data (such as deﬁnitions, comments, synonyms or cross-
references to other databases) and annotations on selected
terms.
Data producers can use the online interface to search
for appropriate terms to annotate their submissions in one
speciﬁc ontology or across all available ontologies served
by the OLS. An ontology browser is also available to
navigate ontologies and controlled vocabularies to ﬁnd
the appropriate context and level of detail for a given
term. Application developers can use the provided web
service interface to fully integrate OLS functionality
within their applications.
Since its inception, it has become an integral part of
many highly accessed databases (2–5) and has been recom-
mended as a data submission resource by the Human
Proteome Organization (HUPO) Proteomics Standards
Initiative (PSI) (6) and by the International Molecular
Interaction Exchange consortium (IMEX) (7).
Application developers are making use of the OLS
web service interface to enrich their own applications.
Examples of this include the Proteome Harvest data sub-
mission tool for PRIDE (8) and the Map2OWL Prote´ge´
plug-in (http://map2owl.sourceforge.net/).
This article describes the new data available in the OLS
as well as the many improvements to both the online and
the programmatic interfaces through which this data can
be browsed and queried.
AVAILABLE DATA
When it ﬁrst became publicly available, the OLS con-
tained 42 ontologies, which accounted for close to 135 000
terms. Over a 2-year period, the data content of the
OLS has grown to 58 ontologies and more than 595 000
terms (Figure 1). These cover far-ranging topics such as
model organism anatomy and development, physiology
and disease, instrumentation and methods and many
others. Signiﬁcant milestones for the OLS include the

incorporation of the NEWT taxonomy that provides
information on over 400 000 taxonomic classiﬁcations
(roughly 330 000 of which are species names) and the
incorporation of all of the HUPO PSI domain ontologies.
Users are encouraged to go online at http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/ontology-lookup/ontologyList.do to access a full
listing of currently available ontologies and controlled
vocabularies. The ontologies are created and maintained
by experts in their respective ﬁeld (4,9–12) and many of
the more commonly used ones are mirrored by the Open
Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry (13). In order to
provide the latest versions of these ontologies and main-
tain the OLS as up-to-date as possible, the ontology
providers are polled on a daily basis and updated ﬁles are
downloaded and parsed to update the core OLS database.
The OLS data loaders have been run 835 times and have
refreshed 1900 ontologies since September 1, 2006.
The OLS now provides a complete database export in
MySQL format for users who wish a local copy of the
relational data for their own queries. This database export
is done on a weekly basis and can be obtained from the
EBI public FTP server (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/
ols). Information on how to use this database export can
be found online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/
databaseExport.do.
INTERACTIVE USER INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS
The OLS provides a rich browsing experience using AJAX
technologies. A suggest-as-you type search mechanism has
received very positive feedback from users who are
looking for terms to annotate their data but are unsure
where to start looking. Once a term is selected, metadata
(deﬁnition, synonyms and cross-references) are fetched
from the database and displayed to the user. Users can
browse full ontologies or subsets of them with a click of a
button. A graph of all possible paths from a selected term
to the root of the ontology will be displayed (Figure 2).
Several improvements have been incorporated into the
online interface. The ﬁrst improvement is the possibility
to include or exclude obsolete terms from the suggestion
list by simply toggling a checkbox (located above the main
search box). By default, terms that have been marked as
obsolete by the ontology maintainers will be returned as
suggested search results. Unchecking the box will prevent
such terms from being returned by the system.
Another improvement has been the possibility to query
the OLS by term identiﬁer (e.g. GO:0008150) and
to provide direct search URLs (e.g. http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/ontology-lookup/?termId=GO:0008150) This fea-
ture allows users to provide links directly to speciﬁc terms,
where the preferred term name and all known metadata
are displayed.
A ﬁnal improvement added to the user interface is the
ability to browse the OLS loader statistics. A link from the
statistics box on the main page allows users to see which
ontologies have been recently updated as well as the
number of terms loaded for each ontology. Users can
navigate in monthly increments to obtain the relevant
information.
SOAP USER INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS
The OLS allows application developers to query and
retrieve data using a web service interface implemented
using the Apache AXIS SOAP toolkit. The web service
interface is described in a WSDL document that can be
used by various high-level programming languages to
properly create messages between the OLS server and the
client application.
One of the strengths of SOAP is that it can be platform
independent across multiple programming languages (e.g.
client code written in Perl running on an Apple Mac OSX
can communicate with a server written in Java running on
Linux). This interoperability is not without its caveats,
however, and there are implementation limitations because
not all programming languages implement the full speci-
ﬁcation and not all implementations are equally good.
To mitigate these eﬀects and improve interoperability
across platforms, the WSDL document describing the
OLS web service was recoded from ‘RPC/encoded’ to
‘document/literal’. These conventions dictate how to
translate a WSDL binding to a SOAP message that can
be exchanged between the client and the server and it is
generally accepted that the ‘document/literal’ provides the
highest possibility of interoperability. Furthermore, the
original interface had overloaded method signatures,
where the same method name had multiple argument
lists. This proved to be problematic for certain platforms
and the issue was resolved by giving each method a unique
name. These improvements allowed the OLS to become
usable in workﬂow engines such as Taverna (14).
The web service interface was also enriched to mirror
work done on the interactive interface and allow a greater
scope of information to be retrieved programmatically.
New methods now allow users to obtain information on
database cross-references and annotations and determine
if terms are obsolete or active. Other methods provide
easier means to navigate relations between terms in
multiple directions (for example, obtaining all the child
terms of a parent, or all the parents for a given child term).

Figure 1. Growth chart of the OLS data content. The amount of data
loaded into the OLS, based on unique terms, has more than quad-
rupled since the service went online. Note that the large increase in
2006 is largely due to the incorporation of the NEWT taxonomy.

Finally, ontology-level methods are also available: it is
now possible to query the load date of an ontology and
also obtain all the terms for an ontology in a single request.
Please refer to the OLS online web service documentation
for a complete technical review on available methods and
how to use them. The documentation can be accessed at
the following link: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/

Once a term is selected, known metadata are obtained and displayed. Users can browse an ontology using the selected term as a starting point. Using
the ontology browser, term relations can be navigated. Highlighting a term will load metadata and provide a graphical display of all paths from that
term to the ontology root(s).

In order to showcase the ease in which the OLS can be
integrated into existing applications, fully functional
demonstration Java applications are made available from
the ‘download’ section of the OLS website (Figure 3).
These applications require Java 1.4 or later to run and
include the complete source code that illustrates how to use
Java to query the OLS web service and use the results.
DISCUSSION
The OLS has proven to be successful beyond its originally
intended scope. Several projects, such as the HUPO PSI,
BioSapiens and PRIDE use the OLS to host their own
domain-speciﬁc ontologies and use it as their primary
ontology browser. PRIDE and IntAct, among other proj-
ects, have successfully incorporated OLS functionality
into their applications to enrich their query and data
annotation interfaces.
The OLS is still under active development and ongoing
work is currently in progress to bring the OLS web service
in line with the latest web service speciﬁcations (WS-I
compliance) and provide a richer object model for
programmatic queries. New ontologies are always being
added to the core database, either coming from the OBO
Foundry or from direct user submissions. Usage statistics
indicate that both the interactive and programmatic
interfaces are showing ever increasing usage. Monthly
usage has rapidly climbed from 120 000 hits in mid-2005 to
over 700 000 hits by late 2007.
OLS development is highly driven by user requirements.
Based on obtained feedback, updates to the online inter-
face have already been implemented, as have been
extensive upgrades to the web server interface. All of
these, combined with complete code samples and FTP
access to a complete database export, provide simple yet
powerful methods to access ontology and controlled
vocabulary data that should suit every user requirement.
