[1] Satellite remote sensing estimates of surface chlorophyll, temperature, wind speed,
and sea ice cover are examined in the region of the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment
(SOFeX). Our objectives are to place SOFeX into a regional context and highlight
regional mesoscale spatial and monthly temporal variability. SOFeX fertilized two patches
with iron, one south of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) and one north of the PF but south
of the Subantarctic Front (SAF). Satellite-observable phytoplankton blooms developed
in both patches. The spring sea ice retreat near the south patch site was delayed in the
2001–2002 season, in turn delaying the naturally occurring, modest spring bloom in this
region. Ambient surface chlorophyll concentrations for the area surrounding the southern
patch during January 2002 are low (mean 0.26 mg/m3) compared with climatological
January values (0.42 mg/m3). Regions east and west at similar latitudes exhibited
higher mean chlorophyll concentrations (0.79 and 0.74 mg/m3, respectively). These
modest phytoplankton blooms were likely stimulated by melting sea ice via changes
in the light-mixing regime and release of iron and were smaller in magnitude than the
iron-induced bloom within the SOFeX southern patch (>3 mg/m3). Iron inputs from
melting ice may drive much of the natural spatial and temporal variability within the
seasonal ice zone. Mean chlorophyll concentrations surrounding the SOFeX northern
patch site were similar to climatological values during the SOFeX season. The northern
patch was stretched into a long, thin filament along the southern boundary of the SAF,
likely increasing the mixing/dilution rate with surrounding waters.

1. Introduction
[2] The Southern Ocean (SO) is the largest of the high-
nitrate, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions where the key
macronutrients nitrate and phosphate are typically at high
concentrations and thus do not limit biological production.
Early researchers suggested that a micronutrient, perhaps
iron, limited phytoplankton growth rates preventing the
consumption of the available macronutrients [Gran, 1931;
Hart, 1934]. Atmospheric deposition of mineral dust, the
key source of iron to open ocean surface waters, is quite low
throughout most of the SO [e.g., Mahowald et al., 1999].
John Martin and coworkers using trace metal clean, bottle
incubation experiments in this region demonstrated that the
addition of iron stimulates phytoplankton biomass increase
and strong macronutrient drawdown in the Southern Ocean
[Martin et al., 1990a, 1990b]. The satellite perspective also
supported the hypothesis of iron limitation with phytoplank-
ton blooms apparent mainly in coastal/shelf waters (where
there is a sedimentary source for iron), downwind of
Patagonia and Australia/New Zealand (where dust inputs
are higher), and to a lesser extent in regions of retreating sea
ice and near the major hydrographic fronts, where there are
also additional iron inputs to surface waters (see discussion
below) [Sullivan et al., 1993; Comiso et al., 1993; Banse
and English, 1997; Moore et al., 1999a, 2000; Moore and
Abbott, 2000; Tyrrell et al., 2005]. Last, several mesoscale,
iron fertilization patch experiments have shown a clear
response to iron additions both in the Atlantic (EISENEX
experiment [Bakker et al., 2005]) and in the Pacific sector
(SOIREE [Boyd et al., 2000] and SOFeX [Coale et al.,
2004]) (see also review by de Baar et al. [2005]).
[3] Yet it is also clear that at times the light regime and
silicic acid availability can also influence phytoplankton
growth rates, and that there can be interactions between
these factors and iron, and at times simultaneous limitation
by multiple factors [Nelson and Smith, 1991; Mitchell et al.,
1991; Van Oijen et al., 2004; Boyd et al., 1999; Hutchins et
al., 2001] (see Boyd [2002] for a recent review). Low light
levels increase the cellular demand for iron, thus colimita-
tion by iron and light may be common in this region, where

mixed layers are often deep, particularly early and late in the
growing season when surface irradiance levels are lower
[Raven, 1990; Sunda and Huntsman, 1997; Boyd et al.,
2000, 2001; Boyd, 2002]. Diatoms increase their Si/NO3

uptake ratios and Si cell quotas under Fe-limiting conditions
[Hutchins et al., 1998; Frank et al., 2000; Watson et al.,
2000; Leynaert et al., 2004]. This effect can promote strong
drawdown of silicic acid leading to Si limitation of the
larger diatoms later in the growing season, particularly in
subantarctic waters [Boyd et al., 1999; Hutchins et al.,
2001; Brzezinski et al., 2005].
[4] Phytoplankton blooms are more commonly observed
in the southwest Pacific sector of the SO than in most other
regions [Sullivan et al., 1993; Moore and Abbott, 2000,
2002; Meguro et al., 2004; D. T. Fitch and J. K. Moore,
Phytoplankton bloom dynamics in the Southern Ocean
marginal ice zone, submitted to Deep-Sea Research, Part
I, 2006]. These blooms have been attributed to the effects of
the retreating ice edge [Smith and Nelson, 1986; Moore et
al., 1999a; Abbott et al., 2000; Moore and Abbott, 2002;
Buesseler et al., 2003; Meguro et al., 2004] and to inter-
actions between SO fronts and the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge
[Moore et al., 1999a; Abbott et al., 2001]. The Antarctic
Polar Front (PF) closely follows the northern flank of this
ridge across the region [Moore et al., 1999b]. Mesoscale
meandering of jets such as the PF and SAF leads to
localized areas of upwelling and downwelling that also
can influence phytoplankton bloom dynamics [Flierl and
Davis, 1993; Olson et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1999a; Lima
et al., 2002]. Elevated dissolved iron concentrations have
been observed at SO fronts and attributed either to enhanced
upwelling or advection from sedimentary sources upstream
[de Baar et al., 1995; Measures and Vink, 2001; Croot et
al., 2004].
[5] Retreating sea ice cover inputs fresh, low-density
water at the surface often resulting in shallow surface mixed
layers. This can improve the irradiance-mixing regime for
phytoplankton, stimulating blooms [Smith and Nelson,
1986], and by reducing light stress can decrease the iron
demand of the phytoplankton community [Raven, 1990;
Sunda and Huntsman, 1997]. Melting sea ice may also
release iron to surface waters [Sedwick and DiTullio, 1997;
Croot et al., 2004]. Sea ice may accumulate iron from
atmospheric deposition of mineral dust [Edwards and
Sedwick, 2001] and may also incorporate iron from sedi-
mentary sources when forming in coastal/shelf regions
[Sedwick et al., 2000; Fitzwater et al., 2000; Grotti et al.,
2005]. The analysis of Meguro et al. [2004] shows ice
formed in the coastal/shelf Ross Sea advected directly
toward the region of the southern SOFeX patch site. They
suggest release of iron from melting sea ice along with seed
stocks of ice algae drive phytoplankton blooms in this
region during the 1996–1997 season. An intense, natural
phytoplankton bloom (in situ chlorophyll observations
>3 mg/m3) was also observed in this region following the
retreating ice edge, during the recent U.S. JGOFS study in
1997–1998, AESOPS [Smith et al., 2000; Buesseler et al.,
2003]. The highest surface layer dissolved iron concentra-
tions (0.25–0.29 nM) during the AESOPS early summer
cruise were observed adjacent to the ice edge, coincident
with high chlorophyll and POC concentrations, suggesting
substantial iron release and biological uptake prior to
sampling [Measures and Vink, 2001]. The strong correlation
between ice retreat and southward bloom propagation
[Buesseler et al., 2003] can be viewed as indirect evidence
of substantial iron release of melting ice fueling the AESOPS
bloom. Croot et al. [2004] report evidence for iron release
from sea ice as a key factor driving aPhaeocystis sp. bloom at
the spring ice edge in the Atlantic sector. Lo¨scher et al. [1997]
also suggest release of dissolved iron from melting sea ice
along 6W during 1992 the ANT X/6 JGOFS expedition. In
addition, ice bergs derived from continental glacial sources
can also release significant amounts of dissolve iron as they
melt [Lo¨scher et al., 1997].
[6] The 2002 Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX)
involved the purposeful fertilization, with dissolved iron
additions, of two mesoscale ocean patches (15 km 15 km),
one north and one south of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) in
the southwest Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean (SO)
[Coale et al., 2004]. Phytoplankton blooms developed in
both iron-fertilized patches with increases in chlorophyll
concentrations, particulate organic carbon (POC), and POC
export, and decreases in surface nitrate, silicate, and pCO2
values relative to surrounding waters [Coale et al., 2004;
Buesseler et al., 2004; Bishop et al., 2004].
[7] The SOFeX experiments were designed to examine
the effects of iron fertilization in both the high-silicate
waters south of the PF, and in the low-silicate waters north
of the PF. Thus the southern SOFeX patch was in a region
with high concentrations of nitrate (28 mM) and silicate
(60 mM), while the northern patch region had high nitrate
(20 mM) but relatively low ambient silicate concentrations
(<3 mM) [Coale et al., 2004]. A key goal of the experiment
was to test how iron additions would affect the ecosystems
in these high- and low-silicate regions. Iron additions to the
south patch were made on year days 24, 29, 32, and 36, and
to the north patch on year days 10, 16, 41. Iron concen-
trations reached 1.2 nM in the north patch and 0.7 nM in the
south patch [Coale et al., 2004]. In the southern patch
(66S, 172W) the result of iron fertilization was a bloom
dominated by diatoms (as in most other fertilization experi-
ments to date, i.e., IronEx II [Coale et al., 1996]; SOIREE
[Boyd et al., 2000]; SEEDS [Tsuda et al., 2003; de Baar et
al., 2005]). In the northern patch a bloom developed
composed of diatoms and a mix of other flagellated phyto-
plankton groups [Coale et al., 2004]. After fertilization max-
imum observed rates of photosynthesis (mmolC/m3/day)
increased by factors of 23.8 for the south patch and 15.9 for
the north patch, and chlorophyll concentrations increased by
factors of 20 and 10 for the south and north patches [Coale et
al., 2004].
[8] Dilution of the fertilized patch with surrounding
waters will act to lower iron and chlorophyll concentrations,
but increase macronutrient concentrations as these are
depleted within the patch [Boyd et al., 2000; Abraham et
al., 2000]. Hiscock and Millero [2005] reported an observed
depletion within the southern patch at day 20 after fertil-
ization of 3.5 mmol/kg nitrate, 0.21 mmol/kg phosphate, and
4.0 mmol/kg silicate. However, correcting for the increases
due to dilution with surrounding waters, the drawdowns by
the bloom increase to 9.2, 0.55, and 10.6 mmol/kg, respec-
tively. At the north patch the observed depletion on Day 39
were 1.4 mmol/kg nitrate, 0.09 mmol/kg phosphate, and
1.1 mmol/kg silicic acid (with dilution corrected estimates

of 7.4, 0.48, and 5.8 mmol/kg, respectively [Hiscock and
Millero, 2005]). Given that initial silicic acid concentrations
at the North patch were only 2.8 mmol/kg, roughly half of
the silicic acid required by the bloom came from mixing in of
surrounding waters [Hiscock andMillero, 2005; Brzezinski et
al., 2005]. The generally low silicic acid concentrations at the
north patch significantly limited biogenic silica production
both within and outside of the patch [Brzezinski et al., 2005].
The addition of iron increased maximum uptake rates and
decreased the half-saturation constant for silicic acid uptake at
the north patch indicating that both silicic acid and iron were
limiting the production of biogenic silica by the diatoms, and
likely controlling their contribution to export production
[Brzezinski et al., 2005].
[9] The increases in export flux associated with the
patches were generally more modest than the increases in
biomass and production. Particulate organic carbon (POC)
and biogenic silica (bSi) export from the southern patch
increased by a factor of 3 from the upper 50 m, with larger
increases of 7 and 6 estimated for the flux at 100 m by the
234Th method [Buesseler et al., 2005]. The natural bloom
observed in this region during AESOPS had significantly
higher POC export than the SOFeX southern patch (roughly
a factor of 2 [Buesseler et al., 2005]). These authors note
that export may have increased after the sampling period for
the southern patch. Bishop et al. [2004] concluded that
export increased significantly within the northern SOFeX
patch as well, using profiling autonomous floats calibrated
with data from the southern patch. All of the above results
clearly indicate that iron was strongly limiting phytoplank-
ton growth and biomass accumulation at both the north and
south SOFeX patch locations. Coale et al. [2004] suggest
that as the blooms developed light limitation due to self-
shading may have prevented full depletion of available
macronutrients.
[10] The northern patch (56S, 172W) was stretched
into a long, thin filament extending approximately 7 km
by >340 km, while the southern patch experienced less
shear and expanded in all directions roughly equally [Coale
et al., 2004]. The shear due to currents and the stretching
into a thin filament of the northern patch was also observed
in the SOIREE fertilization experiment [Boyd et al., 2000].
Despite the stronger shear at the northern site that elongated
the patch, Coale et al. [2004] estimated only moderately
higher dilution rates for the northern patch (0.11 day1
versus 0.08 day1, although a larger dilution rate difference
was observed based on SF6 data alone).
[11] Here we examine satellite remote sensing data from
the SW Pacific to assess (1) What was the natural seasonal
cycle outside the SOFeX patches during the 2001–2002
growing season? (2) How typical was this seasonal cycle
compared to other years? (3) How representative were the
patch locations for this region? (4) How did regional-scale
circulation and other physical forcings influence the two
iron-fertilized patches and surrounding waters? and
(5) What are the driving forces of natural variability in
phytoplankton chlorophyll in this region? Remote sensing
data can help place the SOFeX fertilizations into a larger
context, and through comparison of in patch chlorophyll
with surrounding unfertilized waters, provide insight into
the relative roles of iron, light, sea ice cover, winds, frontal
dynamics, and other forcings in driving ocean biogeochem-
ical cycling in this region.
[12] In brief, we show that the background biological
conditions around the SOFeX southern patch in the austral
summer of 2002 were somewhat atypical relative to either
the multiyear climatological state or to conditions east and
west of the site in 2001–2002. The adjacent regions both
east and west of the southern SOFeX fertilization site had
elevated chlorophyll concentrations (approaching 1 mg/m3);
we refer to these as ‘‘modest’’ blooms to distinguish them
from the intense blooms observed within the southern patch
and during AESOPS (chlorophyll >3 mg/m3). Because of the
late sea ice retreat, the initiation of the modest spring bloom
often observed in this regionwas delayed fromDecember into
January. The high spatial and temporal variability observed in
the satellite data highlight the degree towhichmodest, natural
perturbation ‘‘experiments’’ continually occur in the South-
ern Ocean, a fact that could be exploited in future field
projects to better understand iron and ecosystem dynamics
in the SO.
[13] Background conditions at the northern patch were
more representative of climatological conditions. The PF
and SAF in this part of the SO are commonly associated
with filaments of elevated surface chlorophyll, at times
exceeding 1 mg/m3 [e.g., Moore et al., 1999a], and the
stretching of the northern SOFeX patch appears to have
been associated with eastward advection along the southern
edge of the Subantarctic Front.
2. Methods
[14] Monthly and daily SeaWiFS images were obtained
from the Goddard Space Flight Center Distributed Active
Archive Center at 9 km resolution (SeaWiFS version 4.0
[McClain et al., 2004]) and at 4 km and 1 km from
MODIS (Terra, for chlorophyll and sea surface temperature
(SST)). Monthly mean sea ice concentrations (NASA Team
algorithm) at 25 km resolution from the Special Sensor
Microwave Imager (SSM/I) were obtained from the Nation-
al Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive
Center [Cavalieri et al., 2004] and remapped to the 9 km
equal-angle grid used for SeaWiFS and the sea surface
temperature (SST) data for comparison. Monthly images of
sea surface temperature (SST) (ascending pass) were
obtained from the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Project at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Cen-
ter [Brown et al., 1993; Kilpatrick et al., 2001]. QuikSCAT
L3 estimates of daily surface wind speeds (0.25 degree
resolution) were also obtained from the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center. To create
climatologies for assessing the SOFeX growing season
(2001–2002), we averaged SeaWiFS chlorophyll, sea sur-
face temperature, and percentage sea ice cover data from
five other growing seasons (1997–1998, 1998–1999,
1999–2000, 2000–2001, 2002–2003).
[15] Several studies have attempted to assess the accuracy
of the SeaWiFS global chlorophyll algorithms in Southern
Ocean waters for versions OC2 [Moore et al., 1999a; Abbott
et al., 2000] and OC4v4 [Murphy et al., 2001; Clementson
et al., 2001; Arrigo and van Dijken, 2004; Garcia et al.,
2005]. Reaching similar conclusions, these studies found
relatively good agreement between in situ measurements

and the satellite estimates (r2 correlations from Type II
linear regressions of 0.6–0.86) with a consistent tendency
for SeaWiFS to underestimate chlorophyll, particularly at
higher chlorophyll concentrations (regressions slopes from
satellite vs. in situ between 0.52 and 0.88). This underes-
timation tendency was also present in the earlier generation
Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) satellite sensor global
algorithm [Mitchell and Holm-Hansen, 1991; Sullivan et
al., 1993], but the problem seems less severe with SeaWiFS
[Moore and Abbott, 2000; Garcia et al., 2005]. The goal of
the SeaWiFS project is to estimate chlorophyll concentra-
tions within ±35% (a goal not always met in the above cited
studies). Garcia et al. [2005] estimated a bias of 21.7%
for the OC4v4 algorithm in SO waters. Here we use the
satellite data to examine spatial and temporal patterns in the
SW Pacific with a focus more on variations rather than
absolute chlorophyll concentrations. We note that absolute
concentrations are likely underestimated, particularly for
mid to high concentrations (>0.5 mg/m3). Another diffi-
culty in interpreting the SeaWiFS imagery is that there is no
way to distinguish changes in phytoplankton biomass
(changes in phytoplankton particulate organic carbon) from
changes in the C/chlorophyll ratios, due to photoadaptation
or varying iron stress. In general, we assume that chloro-

spots indicate the location of initial iron additions during January 2002. The white lines on the sea the

phyll variations are mainly due to changes in biomass,
particularly across regions where SST, wind speeds, and
ice melt influence are similar (i.e., where there is no reason
to assume large changes in mixed layer depths). However,
this complicating factor does add some additional uncer-
tainty to our analysis.
[16] The monthly SST data was used to map the locations
of Antarctic Polar Front (PF) and the Subantarctic Front
(SAF) using methods developed previously for the PF
[Moore et al., 1997, 1999b; Moore and Abbott, 2002]. In
this method, the location of the poleward of edge of the
strong SST gradient associated with frontal features is
subjectively digitized. There is some potential for error
associated with the approach because frontal locations in
this region can shift substantially over the course of a month
[Moore et al., 1999b], and this can smear or obscure the
SST gradient signal in the monthly images. At times the
cross frontal temperature gradient can also be too weak to
be detected with our technique [Moore et al., 1999b].
3. Results
[17] Wintertime sea ice cover directly influences the
southern SOFeX patch site. The spring sea ice retreat in
this region was delayed during the SOFeX season compared
with other years (Figure 1). Heavier sea ice cover (concen-
trations >70%), particularly just south of the injection site,
persisted in this region through December 2001 during the
SOFeX campaign relative to the climatology (Figure 1 and
Table 1). The ice edge extends farther north in the clima-
tology but at low concentrations (<25%). The effect of
heavy sea ice cover can also be seen in the monthly
sea surface temperature (Figure 1) and chlorophyll data
(Figure 2) from the region. There are few valid SST
observations between 65–70S due mainly to heavy sea
ice cover during December 2001 (Figure 1). Sea surface
temperatures tend to be somewhat cooler than the climatol-
ogy at the southern patch site, and generally warmer than
the climatology at the northern patch site (Table 1). In
Table 1, we compare the SOFeX season sea ice cover,
chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature for
two boxes centered on the south and north patch sites with
data from our climatologies. The box averaged for the north
patch is larger to encompass the elongation and substantial
drift observed for the north patch [Coale et al., 2004].
[18] The mean location of the major fronts of the Ant-
arctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are overlain on the
climatological temperature field for December in Figure 1.
These frontal locations are determined by satellite SST for
the position of the PF [Moore et al., 1999a], and by
historical hydrographic data for the SAF and the Southern
Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) [Orsi et al.,
1995]. The SACCF is the most southerly of the three fronts
followed by the PF and then the SAF. The locations of the
SAF and PF during the SOFeX season are shown over the
SST images in Figure 1, where the frontal locations could be
determined in the monthly satellite SST data using the
methods developed previously for the PF [Moore et al.,
1997, 1999b]. The PF is located quite close to its long-term
mean position for the period December through February,
and we were unable to determine the position over most of
this region during March 2002 as sufficiently strong SST
gradients were not observed. The stability of the PF location
is not surprising as topographic control of the PF location is
quite strong in this region [Moore et al., 1999b]. The
satellite derived SAF was located several degrees of latitude
north of the mean position determined from hydrography by
Orsi et al. [1995], and can be seen in the same general
location in each monthly SST image. In subsequent sec-
tions, we will show that the SOFeX northern patch was
stretched into a long thin filament along the southern
boundary of this front.
[19] Examining the regional monthly surface chlorophyll
values for this region from SeaWiFS, we can see a strong
impact in the southerly areas from the delayed sea ice
retreat. In our climatology, a modest spring bloom is
apparent in the general latitudes of the southern patch
location that is strongest during December, declining in
magnitude during January, and nearly spent by February (at
least north of 70S, below this latitude high chlorophyll
concentrations persist into March) (Figure 2). This bloom is
initiated as sea ice melts, and then moves poleward as the
sea ice retreats further south (compare Figures 1 and 2).
This general pattern is also what was observed in situ and in
the satellite data during AESOPS [Moore et al., 1999a;
Smith et al., 2000; Buesseler et al., 2003]. During the
2001–2002 growing season, the ice edge induced bloom
did not begin until January 2002 and extended well into
February 2002 in the general region between 65 and 70S.
The southern SOFeX patch (66S and 172W) was located

in an area of relatively low chlorophyll that can be seen in
the January 2002 monthly data covering most of the area
between 65 and 70S and 165 and 175W (Figure 2).
Areas with higher ambient chlorophyll concentrations can
be seen both to the east and west of this low chlorophyll
region in the January 2002 and February 2002 monthly
images (Figure 2). It is notable that these areas were able to
achieve chlorophyll concentrations as high as 1 mg/m3
without artificial iron additions, while the SOFeX results
suggest that the waters in the immediate vicinity of
the south patch were strongly iron-limited to the extent
that surface chlorophyll concentrations remained low
(0.3 mg/m3), despite relatively shallow mixed layer depths
of 35 m [Coale et al., 2004]. Coale et al. [2004] argued
that light was not limiting initially but may have become
limiting as the bloom developed. Boyd et al. [2000, 2001]
found that light levels corresponding to mixed layer depths
as deep as 65m did not seriously limit growth rates under
iron-replete conditions.
[20] Farther north in the vicinity of the northern SOFeX
patch site (56S, 172W), in general chlorophyll concen-
trations were slightly lower than the climatology from
January through March south of the fertilization site, while
concentrations north of the fertilization site were quite
similar to the climatological values (Figure 2). Chlorophyll
concentrations to the north of 60S are similar to the
climatology during the month of December, while during
January the region between 55 and 60S and 180 and
170W, which includes the northern patch fertilization site,
chlorophyll concentrations were slightly below the clima-
tological values (Figure 2). This region of somewhat lower
than typical chlorophyll concentrations is expanded during
February and March covering much of the region between
55 and 65S.
[21] Chlorophyll distributions in the southwest Pacific
sector of the SO occur within a background spatial pattern
structured by the locations of the major fronts [Moore et al.,
1999a; Smith et al., 2000]. Elevated chlorophyll associated
with the major fronts can be seen in several of the monthly
images from the 2001–2002 growing season and in the
climatology. During January elevated chlorophyll concen-
trations relative to surrounding waters can be seen at the PF
across the entire region (compare frontal paths in Figure 1
with Figure 2). Similarly, elevated chlorophyll along the
mean location of the SACCF can be observed to some
extent in each monthly image during SOFeX (compare
mean location from Figure 1 with Figure 2). In December
a strong bloom is visible in the vicinity of the mean SACCF
location at 63–64S between 168 and 157W. In the
January image the bloom seen south of 64S between
180 and 175W then extends for hundreds of km to the
northeast along the mean location of the SACCF (compare
Figures 1 and 2).
[22] If we compare the climatology and SOFeX monthly
values in the immediate vicinity of the southern patch site, it
is apparent that chlorophyll was anomalously low during
December and January, and anomalously high during Feb-
ruary and March (Figure 3). Because of the patchy nature of
these data sets because of extensive cloud cover, the bloom
induced by iron additions in the southern patch was not
observed during the month of January by SeaWiFS. How-
ever, elevated chlorophyll is seen in the monthly image for
February at the south patch site (66.1–65.7S, 172.5–
171.8W in Figure 3). (Our 9 km monthly composite data
does not resolve the patch accurately, but see Coale et al.,
2004 for a high-resolution SeaWiFS image of the southern
patch bloom). Also visible is the modest phytoplankton
bloom to the west of the southern patch site. It appears that
this bloom was advected eastward into the original location
of the southern patch fertilization by March (Figures 2 and
3). This is consistent with the observed eastward drift of the
southern patch [Coale et al., 2004, Figure S1].
[23] We also compare chlorophyll concentrations in the
immediate vicinity of the northern patch with the SeaWiFS
Figure 2. Monthly surface chlorophyll concentrations
(SeaWiFS) from our climatology are compared with those
observed during the SOFeX season. White spots indicate
the location of initial iron additions during January 2002.

climatology in Figure 4. Our estimated position for the
southern edge of the SST gradient associated with the SAF
is shown over the chlorophyll image for February in
Figure 4. Chlorophyll concentrations are consistently lower
on the poleward side of this front than to the north by
0.1–0.2 mg/m3 (Figures 4 and 5). The northern patch was
originally fertilized at 56S, 172W, but over the course of
the next several weeks as the phytoplankton bloom was
developing, this patch was stretched into a long thin
filament and advected hundreds of km to the northeast of
the original fertilization site [Coale et al., 2004, Figure S1].
Because of the patchy coverage of the SeaWiFS data this
bloom is not apparent in any image we examined (in the
9 km or the LAC  1km data sets). The bloom is apparent
in several images from the MODIS Terra sensor [see Coale
et al., 2004] (Figure 5). Comparing the chlorophyll and sea
surface temperature data from MODIS on 5 February 2002
(Figure 5) with the monthly SST, chlorophyll and SAF
position from Figures 1 and 4, it is apparent that the
northern patch bloom is being stretched out along the
southern boundary of the SAF.
[24] To better understand the mesoscale spatial patterns in
the southern portion of our study area, we computed mean
chlorophyll concentration, wind speed, percent sea ice
Figure 3. Monthly surface chlorophyll concentrations (SeaWiFS) from our climatology are compared
with those observed during the SOFeX season in the vicinity of the southern fertilization patch.

cover, and sea surface temperature for an area encompassing
the southern patch site, and for representative locations
within the naturally blooming regions to the east and west
of the patch site (Table 2). One possibility for the elevated
chlorophyll concentrations during January 2002 to the west
(area 1) and east (area 3) relative to the climatology and the
2002 SOFeX southern patch region (area 2, see Table 2) is
that shallower mixed layers allowed for reduced light
limitation, decreased iron quotas, and increased phytoplank-
ton growth. Mean wind speeds were nearly identical for the
three regions, but there seem to have been different levels of
freshwater input from melting sea ice in 2001–2002 that
could have affected mixed layer depths (Table 2). Melting
sea ice can also release dissolved iron into surface waters
[Sedwick and DiTullio, 1997; Measures and Vink, 2001;
Croot et al., 2004]. Area 3 to the east of the SOFeX site had
substantially higher sea ice cover during December of 2001,
and cooler mean sea surface temperatures during December
2001 and January 2002, probably indicative of cold melt-
water release from sea ice (Table 2). Area 1 also had
modestly higher sea ice cover during December than area
2. The blooms seen in area 1 (apparent in Figures 2 and 3)
may partly reflect advection from farther west. The mean
January chlorophyll in the region 5 degrees to the west of
area 1 (65–68S by 175–180E) was quite high at
1.04 mg/m3, and the January sea ice was also elevated at
Figure 4. Monthly surface chlorophyll concentrations (SeaWiFS) from our climatology are compared
with those observed during the SOFeX season in the vicinity of the northern fertilization patch.

28% (compare with values in Table 2). Thus the satellite
data is consistent with the idea that the modest blooms seen
both to the east and west of the southern SOFeX patch site
were driven by the generally delayed sea ice retreat seen
during the 2001–2002 growing season. In the vicinity of
the southern patch chlorophyll concentrations were lower
than in these more strongly ice-influenced areas (Table 2).
These ambient concentrations of 0.3 mg/m3 (Table 2 and
Figures 2 and 3) are similar to the values typically observed
in open ocean regions of the Southern Ocean away from the
ice edge blooms [Moore and Abbott, 2000] and likely
reflect reduced ice retreat influence and strong iron limita-
tion. In addition to variations in meltwater and iron release,
the timing of the ice edge retreat may also influence bloom
dynamics in this region as it interacts with seasonal patterns
in solar forcing, sea surface temperature, wind speeds and
direction.
4. Discussion
[25] The SOFeX fertilizations clearly demonstrate that
iron availability was limiting phytoplankton growth rates
and biomass accumulation at both the south and north patch
sites. The satellite data presented here shows that natural,
modest blooms, though smaller in magnitude than observed
in the iron-fertilized south patch, occurred over wide areas
both just to the west and several degrees of longitude to the
east of the south patch fertilization site. Blooms of this
magnitude seem to be a relatively common occurrence in
this region of the SW Pacific [Moore et al., 1999a; Moore
and Abbott, 2000, 2002; Meguro et al., 2004]. Notably, we
did not observe such mesoscale variability in chlorophyll
concentrations in the vicinity of the north patch. We
hypothesize that the key difference was that the southern
region benefited from increased stratification and iron
inputs from melting sea ice and icebergs.
[26] At larger spatial scales, the question remains why are
there consistently modest spring phytoplankton blooms in
this sector of the Southern Ocean, while other areas of ice
retreat show little elevated chlorophyll? The source for the
sea ice melting in this region is likely the Ross Sea. Much of
the ice may be formed nearshore as winds move ice away
from the coast. It is well established that dissolved iron
concentrations in the Ross Sea and other shelf regions are
often elevated due to diffusion and mixing of shelf iron into
the water column [Nolting et al., 1991; Martin et al.,
1990b]. Sea ice formed in this region may have elevated
iron content [Sedwick and DiTullio, 1997; Grotti et al.,
2005]. Icebergs discharged from the Ross ice shelves may
also release large amounts of iron from dust and rock
accumulated through glacial processes on the continent
[Martin et al., 1990b; Nolting et al., 1991]. Martin et al.
[1990a] measured dissolvable iron in a glacial iceberg from
the Gerlache Strait at 26.7 nm/kg. Lo¨scher et al. [1997]
reported iceberg concentrations from 10 to 100 nM. The
southern portion of our study is encompasses the maximum
extent of the seasonal ice zone. The mesoscale spatial
variations seen in our analysis are most likely due to both
varying influence of sea ice melting (variable fresh water
inputs to surface waters) and to variations in the iron
released from the ice which would be a function of ice
formation region (nearshore versus offshore) and atmo-
spheric dust deposition.
[27] Returning to the questions laid out in our introduc-
tion: (1) What was the natural seasonal cycle outside the
SOFeX patches during the 2001–2002 growing season?
(2) How typical was this seasonal cycle compared to other
years? (3) How representative were the patch locations for
this region? (4) How did regional-scale circulation and other

physical forcings influence the two iron-fertilized patches
and surrounding waters? (5) What are the driving forces of
natural variability in phytoplankton chlorophyll in this
region? The seasonal cycle in surface chlorophyll concen-
trations in the vicinity of the northern SOFeX patch was
quite similar to our climatology (Figure 4), and similar to
the pattern seen over much of the Southern Ocean north of
the SIZ [Moore and Abbott, 2000]. The patch was signif-
icantly impacted by advection associated with the SAF
which may have increased the dilution rate between patch
and surrounding waters, helping to fuel the observed bloom.
In particular, had the patch been sited within quieter waters
with less shear, the diatoms might have been more strongly
impacted by Si limitation [Brzezinski et al., 2005; Hiscock
and Millero, 2005] and contributed less to the north patch
bloom. Much of the natural variability in chlorophyll
concentrations in this area appear to be associated with
the location and dynamics of the major oceanographic
fronts [Moore et al., 1999a; Moore and Abbott, 2000,
2002; this study].
[28] The seasonal cycle in the waters encompassing the
southern SOFeX patch was marked by anomalously low
chlorophyll values during December and January (Figures 2
and 3). Our analysis suggests that this area was somewhat
less impacted by sea ice retreat than the regions just to the
west and east which exhibited higher chlorophyll concen-
trations. We suggest that variable iron content within the sea
ice also likely played a role. These modestly blooming
regions adjacent to the southern fertilization site had chlo-
rophyll concentrations well below those observed within the
SOFeX patch or during AESOPS, and thus were likely still
iron limited. It is not clear that the SOFeX bloom would
have progressed much differently if it had been cited in
these regions, or if chlorophyll concentrations at the fertil-
ization site had been more typical of other years. Although,
the initial biomass might have been higher with perhaps an
altered community composition.
[29] Satellite observations of the SOFeX iron-fertilized
patches were limited due to extensive cloud cover. The
available images for both patches, however, do show
chlorophyll concentrations much higher than in the sur-
rounding waters [Coale et al., 2004; this study]. These
images, model simulations, and all of the extensive in situ
data collected during the SOFeX and EisenEx, and SOIREE
experiments clearly illustrate the key role that iron plays in
this region in limiting phytoplankton growth rates and
biomass accumulation [Boyd et al., 2000; Fung et al.,
2000; Coale et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2002, 2004; Bakker
et al., 2005; de Baar et al., 2005]. Observations from the
southern patch [Coale et al., 2004], and from a recent
synthesis of iron fertilization experiment results [de Baar
et al., 2005] also point to light as a limiting factor, even
during summer months, in areas of moderate to high
chlorophyll concentrations. Although, in vitro experiments
Boyd et al. [2000] found evidence little evidence of light
limitation of the SOIREE bloom at a mixed layer depth of
65m with indication of strong light limitation at light
regimes corresponding to mixed layer depths of 100 m. In
the SEEDS experiment, in the subarctic North Pacific,
mixed layers were substantially shallower than in SOFeX,
and the bloom magnitude and nutrient decreases in surface
waters observed were much larger [Coale et al., 2004;
Tsuda et al., 2003; de Baar et al., 2005]. In their review
of eight iron fertilization experiments de Baar et al. [2005]
found in general a strong inverse correlation between wind
mixed layer depth and maximum chlorophyll concentra-
tions, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) removal, and the
overall DIC/Fe efficiency.
[30] More measurements of dissolved and particulate iron
concentrations within sea ice, icebergs, and around the
retreating ice edge are needed to quantify the role of sea
ice and icebergs as iron sources, and to assess the relative
importance of mixed layer shoaling (including its effects on
both light regime and iron quotas), and iron release in the
generation of ice edge phytoplankton blooms. Ongoing
ecological/biogeochemical model simulations and analysis
of a longer time series of satellite wind speed, ice dynamics,
and chlorophyll data should also provide further insights on
these processes.
