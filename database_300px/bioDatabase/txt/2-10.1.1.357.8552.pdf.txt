ABSTRACT
In the absence of the methyl donor S-adenosyl
methionine and under certain permissive reaction
conditions, EcoPI shows non-specific endonuclease
activity. We show here that the cofactor analogue
S-adenosyl homocysteine promotes this promiscu-
ous DNA cleavage. Additionally, an extensive exonu-
clease-like processing of the DNA is also observed
that can even result in digestion of non-specific DNA
in trans. We suggest a model for how DNA commu-
nication events initiating from non-specific sites,
and in particular free DNA ends, could produce the
observed cleavage patterns.
INTRODUCTION
Restriction-modiﬁcation (RM) enzymes are important
systems involved in protecting bacteria and archaea
from infection by bacteriophage DNA. They are wide-
spread in nature, with more than 85% of sequenced gen-
omes containing one or more conﬁrmed and/or putative
RM system, and with over 20% having more than ﬁve (1).
For the three major classes, Types I, II and III, the basal
RM enzyme activities required are a modiﬁcation methyl-
transferase (MTase) and an endonuclease (ENase), both
targeting the same DNA sequence. The MTase covalently
modiﬁes one or both strands of every recognition site in
the host genome, so rendering them resistant to cleavage
by the cognate ENase. This is of paramount importance
given the lethality of dsDNA breaks (2). For the Type I
RM systems and the majority of Type II RM systems
[with the exception of MmeI and closely related Type
IIG enzymes—ref. (3)], methylation occurs on both
DNA strands. Following semi-conservative replication,
each site is still methylated in one strand (hemimethylated)
and thus protected from cleavage. Maintenance methyla-
tion then reinstates the full methylation pattern before the
next round of replication. For the Type III RM enzymes,
however, only one strand of the asymmetric recognition
site is ever methylated (4–8). Semi-conservative replication
of hemimethylated DNA produces sites that are comple-
tely unmethylated, and potentially unprotected (9,10).
Type III restriction endonucleases overcome this potential
threat to the host genome by only cleaving DNA follow-
ing interaction with two indirectly repeated sequences
(9–12). In this arrangement, one site of each pair will
always be hemimethylated following replication, so pre-
venting cleavage (10)—directly repeated sites would not
oﬀer the same protection. We show here for the Type
III RM enzyme EcoPI that this regulation of cleavage
activity can be completely turned oﬀ by the cofactor prod-
uct S-adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy) and that EcoPI
can initiate illegitimate cleavage from DNA ends.
EcoPI is a prototypical Type III enzyme (13,14). It com-
prises a hetero-tetrameric complex between MTase (Mod)
and helicase-nuclease (Res) subunits with the stoichiome-
try Res2Mod2 (15). The complex recognises the DNA
sequence 50-AGACC-30: the MTase activity modiﬁes the
exocyclic N7 of the second adenine (AGmACC), the
nuclease activity cleaving the DNA 25–27 nucleotides 30
to the site (4). The in vitro DNA cleavage properties of
EcoPI are dependent upon both buﬀer conditions and the
presence or absence of the MTase cofactor S-adenosyl
methionine (AdoMet) (11). AdoMet plays three roles: as
a methyl donor for DNA methylation (16); as an allosteric
activator of DNA binding (17,18) and as a speciﬁcity
factor, preventing unregulated cleavage of DNA sub-
strates (11). Under non-permissive conditions (the pres-
ence of Na+ ions in the reaction buﬀers), DNA cleavage
only occurs on DNA with two indirectly repeated recog-
nition sites and AdoMet signiﬁcantly stimulates this cleav-
age (11). Under permissive cleavage conditions (the
presence of K+ ions in the reaction buﬀers), EcoPI will
also cleave DNA with two directly repeated sites and even
DNA with a single site (11). This ‘secondary’ cleavage is
an order of magnitude slower than the primary cleavage,

requires a sizeable molar excess of enzyme over sites
(>3-fold—see below and Figure 1) and is ineﬃcient if
the DNA is not cut ﬁrst by a head-to-head (HtH) directed
cleavage event. Under these conditions, AdoMet actually
enhances the speciﬁcity of EcoPI, by turning oﬀ the cleav-
age activity on the non-speciﬁc substrates whilst maintain-
ing cleavage of speciﬁc DNA.
To address how cofactor binding modulates the nucle-
ase activity of EcoPI, we examined DNA cleavage in the
presence of AdoHcy, the cofactor product that results
from the transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to
DNA by the methyltransferase. AdoHcy has been shown
to have a similar overall allosteric eﬀect on DNA binding
by EcoPI as AdoMet (18) and generally acts as a compet-
itive inhibitor of methyltransferases (19). Here, we found
that AdoHcy supports and promotes DNA cleavage
without the requirement for two indirectly repeated sites.
This secondary cleavage was particularly enhanced by the
presence of free DNA ends. Following the primary- and
secondary-cleavage events, EcoPI could also become acti-
vated to cleave non-speciﬁc DNA via an exonuclease-like
route, causing a processive shortening of linear DNA
substrates. Our data suggest that there is a ﬁne balance
between enhancing DNA binding whilst preventing unde-
sirable DNA-cleavage events.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Proteins
EcoPI and Tn21 resolvase were puriﬁed as described pre-
viously (11,12,15). Protein concentrations were deter-
mined from the absorption at 280 nm using extinction
coeﬃcients derived from the aromatic amino-acid com-
position in the predicted amino-acid sequences.
Concentrations for EcoPI were calculated in terms of a
Res2Mod2 heterotetramer. All other enzymes were
obtained from either New England Biolabs (MA, USA)
or Promega (WI, USA) and were used as recommended by
the manufacturer.
DNA
Plasmids constructed previously (11) were used to trans-
form E. coli HB101. Transformants were grown in LB
medium plus the appropriate antibiotic and the covalently
closed circular form of the DNA puriﬁed by either density
gradient centrifugation in CsCl–ethidium bromide or
Qiagen Midiprep. We have not noted any diﬀerence in
enzyme activity between the diﬀerent preparation meth-
ods. Catenanes were prepared by treatment of supercoiled
plasmid DNA with Tn21 resolvase (12). DNA concentra-
tions were determined from absorbance at 260 nm, assum-
ing an extinction coeﬃcient of 0.02ml/mg cm and a DNA
molecular weight of 6.6 105 Da/kbp. End labelling of the
DNAwith biotin was carried out using Klenow (30–50 exo-)
polymerase and biotin–dUTP (20). Where the DNA was
linearised prior to the addition of EcoPI, the Type II
restriction enzymes used were inactivated either by heating
at 678C for >20min or by phenol–chloroform extraction.
dsDNA oligoduplexes were annealed using synthetic oli-
godeoxyribonucleotides supplied by either Cruachem
(Glasgow, Scotland) or MWG (Germany). DNA concen-
trations were determined from absorbance at 260 nm using
the extinction coeﬃcients provided by the suppliers.
DNA-cleavage assays
Cleavage reactions contained DNA (concentrations
in ﬁgure legends) in either NEB4+ [20mM Tris–acetate,
pH 7.9, 10mMMg acetate, 50mM K acetate, 1mMDTT,
4mM ATP], KGlu+ [50mM Tris–Cl, pH 8.0, 10mM
MgCl2, 20mM K glutamate, 4mM ATP] or NaCl+
[50mM Tris–Cl, pH 8.0, 10mM MgCl2, 50mM NaCl,
4mM ATP] supplemented with 100 mM AdoMet or
AdoHcy as indicated in the text. The K-based buﬀers
produced the same eﬀects in these experiments and were
interchangeable. Where linear ends were to be capped,
streptavidin was added to 100 nM. Reactions were started
by addition of EcoPI to reduce the eﬀect of co-methyla-
tion and incubated at 378C. Reaction aliquots were
quenched after the required incubation times by addition
of one-half volume of STEB [0.1M Tris–Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2M
EDTA, 40% (w/v) sucrose, 0.4mg/ml bromophenol
blue]. The DNA substrates and products were separated
by agarose gel electrophoresis. To avoid the presence
of shifted bands, streptavidin was removed by phenol–
chloroform extraction. Digital images of the agarose gels
were captured on either a Kodak Image Station 440CF
or a UVP GelDoc-It Imaging System using a linear inten-
sity scale.
RESULTS
AdoHcy promotes secondary DNA cleavage and additional
exonucleolytic processing
To assess the eﬀect of AdoHcy on DNA cleavage, we
monitored the extent of DNA cleavage at diﬀerent
EcoPI concentrations. The AdoHcy concentration was
ﬁxed at 100 mM. The DNA substrates chosen
(Figure 1A), were a two-site indirectly repeated plasmid
(pMDS36a, referred to here as pHtH for clarity), which
should be a substrate for both primary (speciﬁc) and sec-
ondary (non-speciﬁc) DNA cleavage, as well as a two-site
directly repeated plasmid (pMDS36b, referred to here as
pHtT) and a one-site plasmid (pMDS33, referred to here
as pOne) which are only substrates for secondary cleavage
(11). Based on our previous studies of EcoPI (11), K+ ion-
based buﬀers were chosen which support both primary
and secondary cleavage. We also tested a NaCl buﬀer
that does not support secondary cleavage and inhibits pri-
mary cleavage (11). The EcoPI concentration range was
chosen to be in excess of the DNA, as this is the condition
under which secondary cleavage is observed. Reactions
were initiated by mixing DNA with enzyme and ATP
and quenching the reaction after 60min. DNA species
were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis
(Figure 1B, C and D).
In the absence of exogenously added cofactor and the
presence of K+ ions, we were able to observe the same
secondary DNA cleavage as previously described [ref.
(11)—shown for comparison; Figure 1B]. On pHtH, low
EcoPI concentrations result in cleavage at only one of the
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 12 3935
two sites (distributed 50:50). This is the primary cleavage
event, which is speciﬁc to indirectly repeated pairs of sites.
The equal distribution of cleavage between the sites
reﬂects the fact that the sequence surrounding the EcoPI
site is identical from 10 bp 50 of the site to 30 bp 30 of the
site (11,12). As the enzyme concentration was increased,
cleavage occurred at both sites indicative of secondary
cleavage. We note that these gels reveal linear DNA pro-
ducts, which appear diﬀuse and of a smaller apparent size
than expected, the eﬀect becoming more pronounced as
the EcoPI concentration is raised (see below). On pHtT,
low EcoPI concentrations did not result in DNA cleavage,
as expected, as primary cleavage cannot occur between
directly repeated sites. At elevated enzyme concentrations,
secondary cleavage resulted in DNA nicking and the
production of some linear DNA cut at one or other site
(FLL). On pOne, low EcoPI concentrations do not result
in DNA cleavage, as expected, whilst elevated enzyme
concentrations resulted in DNA nicking and a trace
amount of FLL DNA.
When these reactions were repeated in the presence
of AdoHcy in the K+ buﬀer, the eﬃciency of non-speciﬁc

indicated by their sizes in bp or as FLL (full length linear). Other species are indicated as CCC (covalently closed circular DNA), OC (open circle/
nicked DNA) or Dimer (a minor contaminant of our plasmid preparations). The DNA smearing is not dependent on the presence of protein in the
gel (i.e. because of a reverse bandshift) as the same patterns were observed following phenol–chloroform extraction of the samples (e.g. see Figure 7).
Note, the non-speciﬁc 1818-bp product fragment highlighted in red is also processed by EcoPI to produce smeared DNA.
3936 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 12
DNA cleavage was increased substantially (Figure 1C).
First, on all three substrates, secondary cleavage occurred
at a lower concentration than with buﬀer alone. Secondly,
dsDNA cleavage at every site was observed on pHtT and
pOne. Thirdly, in all cases the linear products were further
processed in an EcoPI concentration-dependent manner
resulting in smeared DNA indicative of end-speciﬁc
processing. For pOne, trace amount of linear DNA of a
deﬁned size can also be observed within the smear, which
may indicate precise cleavage at non-speciﬁc or star sites.
Note that smearing of the 1818-bp fragment is also
observed despite the absence of an EcoPI site on this
DNA (fragments without an EcoPI are shown in red in
each ﬁgure). With the entire DNA tested, trace amounts of
substrate and nicked DNA remained, even at the highest
EcoPI concentrations. This may result from methylation
of the DNA coincident with DNA cleavage due to trace
amounts of tightly bound AdoMet that co-purify with
EcoPI and cannot be competed out by the excess
AdoHcy [see ‘Materials and Methods’ section, ref. (11)].
The same AdoHcy titrations in the presence of Na+
ions produced quite diﬀerent eﬀects (Figure 1D). Whilst
the extent of pHtH was enhanced compared to in the
absence of cofactor (11), complete DNA cleavage was
only observed with a large excess of enzyme over DNA
and no secondary cleavage was observed. On pHtT, a
small amount of nicked DNA was produced with a trace
of linear DNA. This suggests that some secondary cleav-
age is occurring but only of one DNA strand—this would
not be observed in the linear products on pHtH. On pOne,
a trace amount of nicked DNA was observed at the high-
est enzyme concentrations. These results are similar to
those presented previously (11), in that Na+ ions tend
to disfavour endonuclease activity to such an extent that
secondary cleavage is not observed.
The results obtained suggest that, in the presence of K+
ions, AdoHcy does not prevent secondary cleavage but
actually enhances the non-speciﬁc cleavage. The smearing
seen is much more pronounced overall. However, as
seen in the absence of cofactor, the secondary cleavage
is still more eﬃcient when there are two indirectly repeated
sites present. All subsequent experiments were carried out
using the K-based buﬀers.
AdoHcy-dependent DNA processing requires an EcoPI site,
ATP hydrolysis and a wild-type nuclease active site
One interpretation of the above results is that AdoHcy
promotes random DNA cleavage independent of the inter-
action with an EcoPI-recognition site. Another interpreta-
tion is that a contaminant in our protein preparations
caused the additional processing. To explore these possi-
bilities, the AdoHcy-dependent secondary cleavage of
DNA was tested at high EcoPI concentrations on circular
DNA and linear DNA lacking an EcoPI site (based on
pLJP10, referred to here as pNone; Figure 2A and B).
No cleavage was observed on either circular or linear
DNA (regardless of whether the end was blunt, 50 over-
hang or 30 overhang), indicating that the cleavage seen in
Figure 1 is speciﬁc to the presence of at least one EcoPI
site. Using the pOne substrate we also showed that
secondary cleavage (i.e. DNA nicking) in the presence of
AdoHcy was dependent upon both ATP hydrolysis and
the presence of a wild-type nuclease motif (Figure 2C).
These results are completely consistent with an EcoPI-
dependent eﬀect.
AdoHcy-dependent non-specific DNA cleavage is slower
than specific DNA cleavage
Previously, we showed that secondary DNA cleavage in
the absence of AdoMet is more than 10-fold slower than
the primary cleavage (11). In a similar manner, we mea-
sured the time-dependence of DNA cleavage in the pres-
ence of AdoHcy at a ﬁxed, elevated concentration of
EcoPI. On pHtH (Figure 1A), the ﬁrst DNA cleavage
intermediate that accumulated within 3min was the FLL
DNA cleaved at one or other EcoPI site (Figure 3A). Very
little nicked DNA intermediate is liberated. These kinetics
match those observed in the absence of cofactor and rep-
resent the rate of the site-orientation speciﬁc, primary
cleavage reaction. Subsequently, cleavage at the remaining
intact site occurs, albeit on a much slower timescale. This
DNA is then further processed to give a smear of DNA of
diﬀerent lengths. The shortening of the 2512 and 1818 bp
fragments and the increasing length of the smear with
time are indicative of either an exonuclease activity (i.e.
removal of 1 bp at a time from a DNA end) or a
Figure 2. Secondary DNA cleavage is dependent on the presence of an
EcoPI site, ATP and a wild-type P(D/E)xK nuclease active site. (A) The
requirement for an EcoPI site on circular DNA. Ten nanomolar non-
speciﬁc DNA substrate pNone was treated with varying concentrations
of EcoPI for 1 h with 100mM AdoHcy. (B) The requirement for an
EcoPI site on linear DNA. Non-speciﬁc linear DNA substrates were
generated by cleavage of pNone with diﬀerent Type II restriction
enzymes, as indicated. 10 nM linear DNA was treated with EcoPI at
one of two concentrations for 1 h with 100 mM AdoHcy. (C) The eﬀect
of ATP on secondary cleavage. Ten nanomolar pOne (Figure 1A) was
treated with 300 nM wild-type EcoPI or nuclease mutant
EcoPI(K918A) (15) for 1 h. Reactions were supplemented with 4mM
ATP, 4mM ATPgS, 100mM AdoMet and/or 100 mM AdoHcy, as indi-
cated. For details of the gel labelling, see Figure 1.

processive, end-speciﬁc endonuclease activity (i.e. removal
of >1 bp at a time from a DNA end). This additional
processing occurs on a timescale similar to or slower
than the secondary cleavage. We have been unable to
determine the exact nature of the end processing and so
cannot distinguish between these two models at this time.
On pOne (Figure 1A), the ﬁrst DNA cleavage interme-
diate that accumulated was nicked DNA (Figure 3B).
In contrast to pHtH, this appeared only after hundreds
of seconds, indicative of slow, secondary cleavage. The
linear DNA and smeared products accumulated there-
after, also with a slow rate. This nicked intermediate pro-
duced during secondary cleavage was not observed in
Figure 3A as the DNA undergoing secondary cleavage is
linear and the agarose gels cannot resolve nicked from
intact forms. An accumulation of nicked DNA could indi-
cate that either: (i) two separate DNA-communication
and nicking events produce a dsDNA break or (ii) a
single communication event results in fast ﬁrst strand
cleavage followed by a slow second strand cleavage. We
cannot distinguish between these models from our data.
AdoHcy enhances cleavage of uncapped linear DNA but
has a lesser effect on capped linear DNA
Whilst cleavage of the circular form of pHtH is eﬃcient
even in the absence of cofactor (Figure 1B), cleavage of a
linear form in which the two sites are in the HtH orienta-
tion is surprisingly ineﬃcient; while the circular DNA is
fully cleaved at the lowest enzyme concentration, 3-fold
more enzyme is required to achieve full cleavage of the
linear DNA (Figure 4A). DNA topology has no obvious
eﬀect on Type III RM enzymes (12). Instead, we recently
showed that the poor cleavage of linear DNA was due to
the inhibitory eﬀect of DNA ends on the long-range com-
munication process [ref. (20), see ‘Discussion’ section].
This can be overcome by circularising the DNA [i.e. as
Figure 4. The eﬀect of diﬀerent cofactors on EcoPI cleavage of a linear head-to-head DNA. (A) pHtH (Figure 1A) was treated with NdeI to generate
the head-to-head substrate shown. The DNA intermediates and products resulting from primary cleavage at sites i and ii are indicated. Cleavage of
10 nM linear DNA (FLL) after incubation for 1 h at diﬀerent concentrations of EcoPI is shown in the absence of cofactor (B), the presence of
100mM AdoHcy (C) and the presence of 100mM AdoMet (D). Note, the non-speciﬁc 1818 bp product fragment highlighted in red is also processed
by EcoPI to produce smeared DNA.

cleavage. (A) Ten nanomolar pHtH was mixed with 150 nM EcoPI and
reaction aliquots quenched at the following times (in s): 5, 10, 15, 20,

maps and gel labelling as in Figure 1. Because the DNA smearing
overlapped with linear DNA products, we could not accurately quan-
tify these results.

in a plasmid form—ref. (11)] or by capping the ends of the
DNA using a bulky molecule such as streptavidin (20).
However, whilst primary cleavage appears less eﬃcient,
secondary cleavage of the uncapped linear DNA at ele-
vated EcoPI concentrations appears to be more eﬃcient
than on plasmid DNA, with a higher proportion of
DNA smearing observed (Figure 4B). In the presence of
AdoHcy, the eﬃciency of the secondary cleavage was
enhanced further while primary cleavage was still poor
(Figure 4C). In the presence of AdoMet very little primary
or secondary DNA cleavage was observed (Figure 4D).
In contrast to the proﬁles above, increasing the EcoPI
concentration actually resulted in less nuclease activity
with virtually no DNA cleavage observed above a molar
excess of 10 enzymes per DNA. The time-dependence of
linear DNA cleavage with and without AdoHcy was mea-
sured at a ﬁxed EcoPI concentration (Figure 5). In both
cases a rapid primary cleavage was followed by a more
than 10-fold slower secondary cleavage. In the presence of
AdoHcy, the proportion of initial primary cleavage prod-
uct was lower than in its absence. We demonstrate below
that the interaction between speciﬁcally bound enzymes
and enzymes initiating from a free DNA end produces
secondary cleavage and this can in fact inhibit the primary
events.
To examine further the eﬀects of DNA ends on second-
ary cleavage, we tested a linear form of pOne (Figure 6A).
In the absence of cofactor, complete DNA cleavage and

generate the linear substrate shown. This DNA was then labelled at both ends with biotin. Addition of streptavidin then capped the ends (20).
Distances shown are the lengths of the DNA products following cleavage at the single EcoPI site. Cleavage of 10 nM linear DNA (FLL) after
incubation for 1 h at diﬀerent concentrations of EcoPI is shown in the absence of cofactor (B), the presence of 100mM AdoHcy (C) and the presence
of both 100 mM AdoHcy and strepavidin (D). Note, the non-speciﬁc 2868-bp product fragment highlighted in red is also processed by EcoPI to
produce smeared DNA in B and C.

150 nM EcoPI in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 100mM AdoHcy, and reaction aliquots quenched at the following times (in s): 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 60, 90, 180, 600, 1200, 2400 and 3600. For details of the gel labelling, see Figure 4.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 12 3939
additional processing of the product DNA was observed
at elevated EcoPI concentrations. This contrasts with the
corresponding data for the plasmid DNA where very little
full-length linear product is observed even at the highest
EcoPI concentrations (compare Figures 1B and 6B).
In the presence of AdoHcy, the cleavage was even more
eﬃcient, with complete cleavage at lower EcoPI concen-
trations and extensive processing of the DNA products
(Figure 6C). Again, the extent of cleavage was far greater
than that seen with the parental plasmid DNA plus
AdoHcy.
The data above suggest that in the absence of AdoMet,
the presence of free ends on linear DNA can enhance the
secondary cleavage activity of EcoPI. We tested this by
capping the DNA ends with streptavidin (Figure 6D).
The amount of DNA cleavage seen with AdoHcy was
signiﬁcantly reduced and the residual cleavage must be
the result of a lower level of initiation of secondary cleav-
age from internal non-speciﬁc sites. Note, nicking of the
linear DNA cannot be observed in this assay.
End-specific processing does not have a directionality
The data above suggest that interaction of EcoPI with a
free DNA end can signiﬁcantly enhance secondary DNA
cleavage both in the absence and presence of AdoHcy. But
does this interaction have a polarity? In other words, did
the secondary cleavage of the one-site linear DNA in
Figure 6B and C initiate from either the upstream end
or downstream end exclusively? To answer this, we end
labelled a one-site linear DNA with biotin and then cut
the DNA either up- or downstream of the EcoPI site to
generate a single unlabelled DNA end (Figure 7A). We
then tested DNA cleavage in the absence or presence of
streptavidin, which would block the labelled end only
(Figure 7B). When both ends were capped, end-directed
DNA cleavage was prevented. A residual level of cleavage
remained due either to enzymes initiating internally
(as in Figure 6D) or to end capping being less than
100% eﬃcient. When only one end was capped, secondary
DNA cleavage still occurred, albeit at a reduced level.
No signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the ends was observed,
indicating that either: (i) interaction with a DNA end can
occur in either polarity or (ii) interaction only occurs
in one polarity but that subsequent communication is
via a process that doesn’t retain the polarity, such as 3D
DNA looping.
End-specific DNA processing occurs on both ends of
the cut DNA
As noted in red in Figures 1, 4, 6 and 7, the products of
cleavage at a recognition site are extensively processed
regardless of whether or not they retain an EcoPI site.
These results might seem surprising given that we
showed in Figure 2A that linear DNA without an EcoPI
sites is resistant to DNA cleavage. One explanation for
this may be that following dsDNA hydrolysis with
AdoHcy, EcoPI retains a tight hold on both ends of the
cleaved DNA. Consequently, the enzyme could process a
linear DNA that does not contain a recognition site. This
model would predict that secondary processing would
only occur on the products of a site-dependent cleavage
reaction and not on any other exogenously added non-
speciﬁc DNA. We tested this by mixing a linear one-site
DNA with either circular or linear non-speciﬁc DNA
(these substrates were generated from a one-site cate-
nane—Figure 8). In both cases (Figure 8A), the one-site
DNA was processed as expected. When the additional
non-speciﬁc DNA was linear, it was also processed by
EcoPI, as eﬃciently as the products from the site-speciﬁc
cleavage. However, when the non-speciﬁc DNA was cir-
cular, only DNA nicking was observed. This indicates that
following DNA cleavage of a DNA carrying an EcoPI
site, the nuclease can leave that DNA and go on to process
other DNA with no requirement for the presence of a site.
This reaction is particularly noticeable if the non-speciﬁc
DNA has a free DNA end. One prediction from this new
model is that as the amount of site-dependent cleavage
increases, there will also be an increase in site-independent
DNA processing. This was tested in Figure 8B by using
circular or linear speciﬁc one-site DNA with linear
non-speciﬁc DNA in trans. When the speciﬁc DNA was
circular, the absence of free DNA ends resulted in low
levels of secondary cleavage and correspondingly, very
little, if any, processing of the linear non-speciﬁc DNA.
In contrast, when the speciﬁc DNA was linear, end-
directed secondary cleavage was more extensive resulting
Figure 7. Secondary DNA cleavage by EcoPI is enhanced equally well
by the presence of an up- or downstream free DNA end. (A) A biotin-
labelled one-site linear DNA (Figure 6A) was further treated with
either AatII or XhoI to remove either the upstream or downstream
biotin, respectively. Cleavage of 10 nM one-site DNA labelled at both
ends (left gel), at the downstream end only (middle gel) or at the
upstream end only (right gel) was tested in the presence of 100mM
AdoHcy and 150 nM EcoPI. Where indicated, strepavidin was added
to cap the biotin ends. Note, the non-speciﬁc fragments highlighted in
red were also processed by EcoPI to produce smeared DNA.

in a correspondingly higher level of processing of the non-
speciﬁc DNA.
To further test what is required to activate cleavage of
non-speciﬁc DNA in trans, we followed the cleavage of a
linear non-speciﬁc DNA (pNone—Figure 2A) at a ﬁxed
concentration of EcoPI in the presence of AdoHcy and
various oligoduplex substrates (Figure 9). Consistent
with Figure 2, in the absence of an EcoPI site, no cleavage
was observed. Extensive in trans processing of the non-
speciﬁc DNA was observed in the presence of an oligodu-
plex containing an EcoPI recognition sequence and either,
an intact or pre-cut cleavage site (Figure 9A and B). At the
highest concentrations of the oligoduplex (5 mM), the
trans-activation step was inhibited, presumably because
the excess EcoPI sites and/or DNA ends sequestered the
entire available enzyme. In contrast, in trans processing of
the non-speciﬁc DNA was not observed if the oligoduplex
lacked a DNA cleavage site (Figure 9C) or lacked an
EcoPI-binding site (Figure 9D). These data suggest that
EcoPI does not need to have undergone a DNA-cleavage
step itself—there merely needs to be the presence of a
suitably cleaved EcoPI site.
The data above show that once EcoPI is associated
with a cleaved DNA end, it can go on to cleave other
DNA in trans, but with a particular preference for mole-
cules with a free end. Consistent with this idea, capping of
the ends of a linear non-speciﬁc DNA with streptavidin
signiﬁcantly reduced the non-speciﬁc processing
(Figure 10) (although we cannot rule out nicking of this
substrate as was observed with the circular DNA—as in
Figure 8B).
DISCUSSION
A model for secondary cleavage and end-specific
processing by EcoPI
We have recently proposed a 1D sliding model for
long-range communication on DNA between Type III
enzymes (20), in which DNA cleavage results from colli-
sion between a diﬀusing EcoPI complex and a static EcoPI
complex bound at a speciﬁc site (Figure 11A). Movement
is licensed by an ATP-hydrolysis step that initiates 1D
diﬀusion (ATP hydrolysis thereafter is no longer essential
although it could still occur). Based around this model, we
propose a scheme, which can explain the observations
presented above (Figure 11B). We suggest that the ATP-
hydrolysis step, and thus initiation of motion, can occur
at any DNA sequence (both speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc
DNA-dependent ATPase activities have been measured
for EcoPI—Ju´lia To´th and M.D.S., unpublished data).
However, because the ATP-hydrolysis step is slow, the
binding lifetime at a site will dictate whether motion initi-
ates. Conditions that promote binding to non-speciﬁc
DNA will therefore lead to an increase in the occurrence
of illegitimate licensing events (i.e. initiation of communi-
cation without ﬁrst binding a recognition site) and thus
secondary cleavage. Such conditions could be: (i) an
increase in protein concentration that, by the law of
mass action, would lead to an increased probability of
non-speciﬁc DNA binding; (ii) an allosteric eﬀector
such as AdoMet or AdoHcy that acts to increase DNA-
binding lifetime and (iii) ionic conditions that favour
DNA association. If EcoPI has a much tighter binding
to DNA ends compared to internal sites, then the
Figure 8. Processing of non-speciﬁc DNA in trans by EcoPI is enhanced by DNA ends and is dependent upon the extent of initial EcoPI cleavage.
pOne (Figure 1A) was treated with Tn21 resolvase to produce a singly interlinked catenane as shown. This was further treated with diﬀerent Type II
enzymes to give the combinations of linear and circular DNA shown. The DNA mixtures (10 nM of each species) were incubated for 1 h at the
diﬀerent concentrations of EcoPI indicated. See text for full details. Note, the fragments highlighted in red are also processed by EcoPI to produce
smeared DNA.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 12 3941
probability of non-speciﬁc interactions with uncapped
linear DNA will be greater than on capped or circular
DNA.
Although the probability of non-speciﬁc interaction
could be increased by the inclusion of an allosteric eﬀector
of DNA binding such as AdoMet or AdoHcy, the relative
eﬀects of the two cofactors on subsequent DNA cleavage
are quite distinct. In the presence of AdoMet, EcoPI can
initiate from a non-speciﬁc site/end but subsequent colli-
sion with a speciﬁcally bound enzyme leads to inhibition
of cleavage [Figure 4D, ref. (11)]. In contrast, in the pres-
ence of AdoHcy, there is a stimulation of promiscuous
DNA cleavage by both endonuclease- and exonuclease-
like routes (Figures 1, 4 and 6). Why do AdoMet and
AdoHcy have such strikingly diﬀerent eﬀects on EcoPI?
A diﬀerence in conformation of the Mod subunit must
therefore be transmitted to the Res subunit. However,
footprinting experiments on the related EcoP15I enzyme
did not demonstrate any change in DNA binding with
AdoHcy (21). Unfortunately, we currently do not have
any structural information on Type III Mod subunits
and a sensible answer to this question awaits structural
information on the Res2Mod2 complex.
Figure 9. Processing of non-speciﬁc DNA in trans by EcoPI is enhanced by DNA oligoduplexes containing the recognition and cleavage sites. pNone
(Figure 2A) was cleaved with NdeI. Five nanomolar of this linear DNA was mixed with 150 nM EcoPI in the presence of AdoHcy. The oligodu-
plexes shown were added at the concentrations indicated and incubated for 1 h. (A) Oligoduplex containing an EcoPI-recognition sequence
(in yellow) and an intact cleavage site (in blue). (B) Oligoduplex containing an EcoPI-recognition sequence and a DNA end that mimics an
EcoPI cleavage product. (C) Oligoduplex containing an EcoPI-recognition sequence but no cleavage site. (D) Non-speciﬁc oligoduplex. Processing
of the non-speciﬁc linear DNA in (A) and (B) is so extensive that little-or-no DNA products remain visible.
Figure 10. Processing of non-speciﬁc linear DNA in trans by EcoPI is
blocked by capping the DNA ends with strepavidin. pNone (Figure 2A)
was cleaved with NdeI and the ends labelled with biotin. 10 nM of
this DNA was mixed with 10 nM linear one-site DNA (Figure 6A)
and incubated for 1 h at the diﬀerent concentrations of EcoPI indi-
cated. Where streptavidin was included in the reaction, so capping
the ends of the non-speciﬁc DNA, processing in trans was signiﬁcantly
decreased.

How could the cleavage of non-speciﬁc DNA in trans
come about? In our model (Figure 11A), an active endo-
nuclease is only formed following a long-range communi-
cation event between two enzymes, one bound to a speciﬁc
site, the other diﬀusing on the DNA. Each nuclease con-
tributes to cleavage of one DNA strand and a single EcoPI
enzyme cannot produce a dsDNA break (15). Moreover,
the lack of cleavage activity on DNA in the complete
absence of EcoPI sites (Figures 2 and 9) suggests that
the formation of the active endonuclease requires at
least one speciﬁc recognition site (and cleavage site).
Thereafter, under certain conditions—high enzyme con-
centration and AdoHcy—EcoPI can recruit further pro-
tein and stabilise the nuclease state. This hyperactivated
enzyme is then capable of hydrolysing any non-speciﬁc
DNA. The presence of AdoMet prevents formation of
the hyperactivated state. This state is distinct to the sec-
ondary cleavage form, where at least one recognition site
is required, and where cleavage only occurs at a speciﬁc
site.
Secondary cleavage and end-specific effects in other
RM enzymes
Whilst the dogma for Type III endonuclease activity
requires the presence of two sites in a speciﬁc HtH
repeat (9,10), cleavage of sites in other orientations or
even single sites have been observed (9,21–24). Related
to our results in Figures 6 and 7, Raghavendra and Rao
showed that the related Type III enzyme EcoP15I could
cleave a one-site linear DNA and that this eﬀect was
blocked by the binding of Lac repressor between the site
and the DNA end (22). However, in contrast to our results
in Figure 7, a speciﬁc requirement of the EcoP15I reaction
was for a free DNA end on the 30 side of recognition site.
Nonetheless, the EcoP15I data could be also explained by
our model (Figure 11B): Binding of EcoP15I at a DNA
end and motion inwards would eventually result in colli-
sion with an enzyme bound at the recognition site
and thus cleavage. A diﬀerence in the dynamics of DNA
binding by EcoP15I compared to EcoPI may favour inter-
actions with enzymes from one particular direction. An
internal protein roadblock that prevents 1D communica-
tion between the DNA site and DNA end [i.e. Lac in ref.
(22)] would block this interaction in the same way as cap-
ping of the end by streptavidin as shown here (Figure 6).
Similar to the results from our previous study of EcoPI
(11), AdoHcy-dependent secondary cleavage required the
presence of K+ ions and a large excess of enzyme over
DNA sites. AdoHcy did enhance nuclease activity in the
presence of Na+ ions, but not enough to promote signif-
icant secondary cleavage. Recently, another group have
clearly demonstrated that EcoP15I also exhibits secondary
cleavage in the absence of AdoMet (24) and similar results
have been inferred by others (22,23). However, the
EcoP15I activities are completely independent of the
buﬀer composition (24). Despite the similarity between
the Mod subunits of these enzymes (59% identity),
buﬀer cations have completely diﬀerent inﬂuences on
the target recognition domains. As we pointed out in
our previous study of EcoPI (11), the exact in vitro
Figure 11. The role of diﬀusion and DNA ends on the primary and secondary DNA cleavage activity of EcoPI. (A) Sliding model for long-range
communication by Type III restriction enzymes (20). DNA is shown as a grey line with Type III recognition sequences as arrowheads and cleavage
site as tick marks. Type III enzyme complexes are shown as ellipsoids in white (free in solution, inactive), green (DNA and ATP bound) and pink
(ATP hydrolysed). Steps in the cleavage mechanism are: (1) Type III enzymes bind to the speciﬁc sites; (2) ATP binds; (3) Slow ATP hydrolysis
occurs in the right-hand enzyme, which undergoes a conformational change; (4) 1D sliding of the right-hand enzyme occurs on a much faster
timescale than ATP hydrolysis. Collision of the diﬀusing enzyme with the site-bound enzyme; (5) Long-lived collision complex allows second enzyme
to hydrolyse ATP resulting in an active nuclease and (6) dsDNA cleavage adjacent to the site. Because the ATP hydrolysis is slow and sliding is
presumed to be much faster, collisions (and thus cleavage) principally occur at either one site or the other and not at non-speciﬁc sites. (B) Outcome
of non-speciﬁc initiation of sliding with diﬀerent cofactors. At elevated enzyme concentration, binding to DNA ends, or to a lesser extent to internal
non-speciﬁc sites occurs. These binding events are promoted by cofactor binding. ATP hydrolysis and communication leads to collision with a
speciﬁcally bound enzyme. The resulting outcome then depends on the cofactor present, as shown.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 12 3943
conditions (buﬀer composition, cofactor, DNA substrate
and enzyme concentration) can have a big eﬀect on the
observed DNA cleavage pattern. It is therefore diﬃcult to
establish hard-and-fast rules about non-speciﬁc cleavage
by Type III enzymes. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note
that the Type IIS restriction endonuclease BpuJI has
a 30-end-directed endonucleolytic activity that can also
cleave non-speciﬁc DNA in trans once ‘activated’ by bind-
ing to a recognition site (25), reminiscent of the EcoPI
activity seen in Figure 9. BpuJI-like nuclease domains
can also be found in a subfamily of the Type III R-M
systems, suggesting that non-speciﬁc end processing may
be a more widespread feature.
Does secondary cleavage and additional DNA processing
play a role in the cell?
The observations we present here are useful in understand-
ing the dynamic DNA binding of the Type III enzymes, in
particular underlining the important inﬂuence of DNA
ends. But is there a cellular relevance to the additional
DNA cleavage observed with AdoHcy? Given that the
central role of RM enzymes is to destroy invading foreign
DNA, additional end-speciﬁc processing following a
dsDNA break could be seen as advantageous (26).
Typically, end processing of foreign DNA is catalysed
by the RecBCD/AddAB pathway (27,28). However, if
the foreign DNA contains Chi sequences that can be
recognised by the host exonuclease (RecBCD or
AddAB), then the fragmented DNA could enter the
recombination pathway and restriction activity could
indirectly result in the acquisition of foreign DNA
(26,29). If Type III enzymes were to both cut and degrade
the DNA, this would reduce the chance of this occurring.
A functional cooperation between EcoP15I and an exonu-
clease has also been demonstrated as essential for multiple
rounds of DNA cleavage by a single enzyme complex (30).
Since we only saw the exonuclease activity of EcoPI at
high enzyme concentrations (well above the DNA concen-
tration), it is diﬃcult to assess if this could provide
an alternative method to stimulate enzyme turnover
following cleavage.
Although the in vitro conditions required for non-speciﬁc
cleavage activity—a high concentration of AdoHcy and
enzyme—may never occur in the cell, in vivo ionic con-
ditions and molecular crowding may promote similar
eﬀects at more modest concentrations of enzyme and/or
AdoHcy. We also saw some DNA smearing in the absence
of cofactor (Figure 1B), showing that end processing by
EcoPI is not a special feature of AdoHcy binding per se.
However, uninhibited non-speciﬁc nuclease activity
could be viewed as problematic for a cell as cleavage of
isolated sites or non-speciﬁc DNA sequences on the host
genome would lead to lethal dsDNA breaks. Whilst the 1D
communication events necessary for speciﬁc cleavage
(Figure 11) may be prevented on a protein-coated host
genome, the presence of AdoMet may still be important
in regulating a potentially dangerous Type III enzyme that
would otherwise run amok (11). Even if AdoMet were not
available, the lack of DNA ends on the host DNA may
make initiation of non-speciﬁc events relatively rare.
