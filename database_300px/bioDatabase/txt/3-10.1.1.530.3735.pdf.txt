Mycobacterium immunogenum has been associated with occupational pulmonary disease hypersen-
sitivity pneumonitis (HP). The aim of this study was to identify immunogenic proteins (antigens) in
this pathogen as a first step toward understanding its virulence factors and role in HP etiology.
Immunoproteomic profiling of secreted and subcellular protein fractions using a combination of two-
dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), immunoblotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-
Time of flight (MALDI-TOF) led to the identification of 33 immunoreactive proteins, comprising of 4
secretory, 6 cell wall-associated, 11 membranous, and 12 cytosolic proteins. Of these, eight immu-
noreactive proteins represented homologues of the known mycobacterial antigens, namely heat shock
protein GroEL, antigen 85A, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), L-asparaginase, polyketide synthase, PE-
PGRS, PPE, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Global functional search revealed that the remaining 25
novel mycobacterial antigens in M. immunogenum showed homology with hypothetical proteins (11
antigens) and other bacterial proteins (14 antigens) with a role in virulence, survival, and/or diverse
metabolic functions. To understand immunogenicity of the secretome inM. immunogenum, the major
protein spot on the secretome 2D-gel (consisting of multiple secretory antigens such as OtsB and CtpA,
among others) was eluted and subjected to functional characterization in terms of induction of innate
immune response in murine alveolar macrophages. The secretome eluate caused up-regulation of the
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-R, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-18 and down-regulation of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10, implying a potential of the secreted antigens to cause host immune response underlying
the M. immunogenum-induced lung disease HP. This is the first report on identification of antigens in
M. immunogenum as well as on the potential of its secretome proteins to induce host response. The
identified antigens could have likely roles in virulence and/or diagnosis and serve as potential targets
for drug, biocide, and/or vaccine development.

Introduction
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitously dis-
tributed in the environment,1,2 and are known to cause
pulmonary disease, skin/soft tissue and lymph node infections,3
and opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients
such as the HIV infected individuals.4 Certain species of NTM
are associated with immune-mediated diseases such as hyper-
sensitivity pneumonitis (HP).5 HP also known as extrinsic
allergic alveolitis (EAA) is an immunological lung disease that
is caused by the inhalation of microbial antigens and organic
materials. The symptoms include cough, dyspnea, chest tight-
ness, chills, sweating, malaise, fatigue, and headache, among
others.6,7 In metal cutting industries, exposure to the aero-
solized metalworking fluid (MWF) contaminated with nontu-
berculous mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium chelonae-
Mycobacterium abscessus group has been associated with
hypersensitivity pneumonitis in machine workers.6,8-11 Modern
water-based metalworking fluids are both synthetic and non-
synthetic and often contain microorganisms and their prod-
ucts12 along with the biocides applied for their control. In
particular, Mycobacterium immunogenum, a recently intro-
duced new species in theM. chelonae-M. abscessus group, has
been proposed as the etiological agent of occupational HP in

MWF-exposed workers.13 It shows overlapping genotypic and
biochemical characteristics of M. abscessus and M. chelonae.
Initially, it was reported that only one genotype of M. immu-
nogenum occurs in HP-associated metalworking fluids,14 but
our laboratory has reported the occurrence of multiple
genotypes.15,16 M. immunogenum induces hypersensitivity
pneumonitis-like lung pathology in laboratory mice.5 High
levels of serum antibody against M. immunogenum were
reported in automobile parts manufacturing workers exposed
to the metalworking fluids or those having HP-like symptoms.
This mycobacterial species is susceptible to amikacin and
clarithromycin but resistant to the majority of the well-known
antibiotics like ciprofloxacin, deoxycycline, cefoxitin, turbo-
mycin, and sulfamethoxazole.17 Like other members of the M.
chelonae-M. abscessus group, this species has also been
reported to cause keratitis and myopia-like symptoms and
chronic leg ulcers in infected patients.18,19
Considering that HP is an immune-mediated disorder caused
by the inhaled antigens, there is a need to identify and
characterize the causative antigenic proteins in the etiological
agent. However, practically nothing is known about the anti-
gens and other virulence factors in M. immunogenum. In the
postgenomic era, immunoproteomic approach based on 2-DE
and mass spectrometry20 has proved useful in identification
oftheimmunogenicproteinsinseveralpathogenicorganisms.21,22
In this study, we used this approach to identify immunogenic
proteins (antigens) inM. immunogenum, with a long-term goal
to understand its virulence factors, drug targets, and/or targets
for immunodiagnosis of the disease and/or exposure assess-
ment. Different subcellular fractions ofM. immunogenum cells
were prepared and resolved by 2-DE. Several immunodominant
proteins were identified using immunoblotting coupled with
MALDI-TOF analysis.
While the role of whole cells (cell-associated proteome) of
M. immunogenum in inducing the immune-mediated HP-like
lung pathology and immune response in mice has been
reported,12 the significance of its cell-free proteins (secretome)
in this context is unknown. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) which
act as one of the first-line defenses against the inhaled
mycobacteria have been used as an ex vivo cell model to study
the host innate immune response against mycobacterial secre-
tory proteins. Considering this and the fact that M. immuno-
genum-exposed murine lungs showed AM infiltration,5 this
immune cell type seemed appropriate for testing the functional
significance of secreted proteins (secretome) of M. immuno-
genum. Hence, the major secretome protein fraction eluted
from the 2D-gel was investigated for its potential to induce
cellular and innate immune responses in alveolar macrophages.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Antibody Probe. M. immunogenum
(ATCC 700506), an original isolate from HP-linked metal
working fluids,17 was used. It was routinely maintained on
Middlebrook 7H10 enrichment agar at 37 °C. A polyclonal
antibody against M. immunogenum was custom-raised (Pro-
teintech, Inc., Chicago, IL) in rabbit using heat-inactivated
whole cell suspension.
Preparation of Secretory and Subcellular Protein Frac-
tions. M. immunogenum cells grown in Sauton’s medium up
to midlog phase were harvested by centrifugation at 12 000g
and washed twice with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The cells were
then resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and lysed by
sonication using 5 cycles of alternate 30 s pulsing and 30 s
chilling on ice. Different subcellular fractions (cytosolic, cell
wall, cell membrane) were prepared by differential centrifuga-
tion as reported earlier.23 The cell wall fraction and the
membrane fraction were washed and resuspended in 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and ammonium bicarbonate buffer (100 mM,
pH 8.6), respectively. A homogeneous suspension of the
membrane fraction was obtained by incubating it in a water
bath sonicator and dialyzing in ammonium bicarbonate buffer
containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The secretory proteins
(secretome) fraction was prepared by filtration (0.22 µm) and
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation24 of the culture super-
natant followed by resuspension of the precipitate in rehydra-
tion buffer (9 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)
dimethyl-amonio]-1propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 65 mM DTT).
Protein concentration in different fractions (subcellular and
secretory) was determined using the Quick Start Bradford
protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manu-
facturer’s specifications.25
SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting. Proteins in the test fraction
were resolved by discontinuous SDS-PAGE using 12% poly-
acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and detected by
Coomassie blue staining (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). A replica gel
was subjected to Western blot analysis using the primary
antibody (1:200 dilution) for M. immunogenum and the com-
mercial (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)26 HRP-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit antibody (1:3000 dilution) followed by chemilumines-
cence detection (Promega, Madison, WI) on an X-ray film
(Kodak, Rochester, NY).
2-DE and Immunoblotting. Sample for the isoelectric
focusing (IEF) step was prepared using 100 µg of the protein
fraction of interest in 125 µL of rehydration buffer (9 M urea,
2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, 0.5% IPG buffer and
0.002% bromophenol blue). The IEF was performed on a 7
cm immobiline dry strip pH 3-10 or pH 4-7 (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ) using a IPGphore II isoelectric focusing
system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The strip was
rehydrated at 15 °C for 12 h using 50 µA and focused for
16 000 Vh with an upper current limit of 50 µA. Prior to
running in the second dimension, the strip was incubated
twice (10 min each) in equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 30%
glycerol, 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 0.002% bromophenol
blue), first with 135 mM DTT and then with 135 mM
iodoacetamide. Proteins resolved on the IEF strip were
separated in the second dimension using 10% SDS-PAGE.
The gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby (Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA) for imaging. Replica gels run in parallel were blotted
onto nitrocellulose membrane using the semidry electrob-
lotter (CBS Scientific, Solana Beach, CA). Western blot
analysis was performed using the polyclonal antibody against
M. immunogenum. The 2D-gel and 2D-immunoblot images
were overlaid using the 2D-imaging software (Imagemaster
2D Elitegive version 4.01). The spots showing immunofluo-
rescence were manually picked from the SYPRO Ruby-
stained gel with one-touch spot picker (The Gel Co., San
Francisco, CA) and prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis. An-
tiserum from uninfected rabbit was used as a control and
no immunogenic proteins were detected on these blots. In
a subsequent effort to improve the 2DE-resolution of the
secreted proteins, a larger IPG strip (24 cm) and a precast

4-20% gradient gel (Jule, Inc., Milford, CT) were used for
the separations.
Immunoreactive Protein Identification by MALDI-TOF
Peptide Mass Mapping. Immunodominant protein spots on
the 2D-gel were excised and chopped into small pieces followed
by 3 alternate cycles of washing with 500 µL of 50% acetonitrile
(ACN) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, and
dehydration using 100% ACN. The treated sample was dried
completely by vacuum centrifugation followed by rehydration
at 4 °C for 1 h with 25 µL of trypsin digestion buffer (100 mM
ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2) con-
taining 50 ng of trypsin gold (Promega, Madison, WI). Enough
buffer without trypsin was then added to completely submerge
the gel. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C by
continuous shaking for 16 h. Following incubation, the reaction
mixture was treated with 50 µL of 5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
in 50% ACN (v/v) for 10 min to extract the protein digest. This
process was repeated and the extracts were pooled. The eluted
digested protein sample was evaporated by vacuum centrifuga-
tion and kept at -20 °C until use. During sample analysis, the
peptide extracts were dissolved using 5% TFA in 50% ACN.
The MALDI-TOF analysis was performed using a PE Voyager
DE_STR biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems,
Foster city, CA). The matrix R-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
(CHCA) was prepared in a saturated solution of 50% ACN-0.1%
TFA. For the mass spectral analysis, equal volumes of the matrix
solution (1 µL) and the sample (1 µL) were mixed on the sample
plate, and the mixture was air-dried to form crystals. Each
peptide mass spectrum was calibrated using external standards
from Sigma (Insulin oxide , ACTH Fragment, Angiotensin I,
Bradykinin) and internally calibrated with trypsin autolysis
peaks (monoisotopic peaks of trypsin auto digests were 842.508,
1045.504 and 2211.108 m/z).
Bioinformatic Analysis. Automated analysis of the mass
peaks was done using MASCOT search engine (http://www.
matrixscience.com/search_form _select.html) against the pro-
tein databases. To assign a positive identification, at least three
peptides had to match, with a search tolerance of 100 ppm
while allowing one miscleavage; possible fixed modifications
ascribed to alkylation of cysteine by carbamidomethylation and
oxidation of methionine were taken into consideration. For the
peptide mass fingerprinting based identification, a minimum
of one significance hit (P < 0.05) was considered as an identity.
The MASCOT search allowed identification of a ‘significant hit’
based on a ‘mass score’ cutoff value returned in the output. In
some instances, the protein was identifiable despite the low
mass score because its top hit was a mycobacterial protein
(which allowed it to be differentiated from other proteins). The
bioinformatics approach for protein identification is demon-
strated in the Supporting Information showing GroEL protein
identification of M. immunogenum as an example (supple-
mentary file 1).
Mycobacterial Database Searching. The MASCOT identified
proteins were characterized using the available mycobacterial
databases, namely Tuberculist (www.sanger.ac.uk), Proteome
2D-PAGE Database (http://web.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/
pdbs/2d-page), and pseudo gel images of mycobacterial pro-
teins (http://cmr.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/shared/Pseudo2DGel.)
and the published literature on mycobacterial proteins.
Functional Analysis of the Major Secretome Fraction
(Secretome Eluate). 2-DE of the secretome yielded a dominant
protein spot consisting of major fraction (almost 99%) of the
unresolved secretory proteins; the spot yielded a large immu-
noreactive signal in the Western blot. This major immunore-
active protein spot was subsequently electroeluted27 for func-
tional analysis using a freshly run 2D-gel. Total protein
concentration in the eluted secretome fraction (also designated
as ‘secretome eluate’) was determined as above. This eluate
preparation represented a mixture of immunoreactive pro-
teins of the secretome, some of which were identifiable (see
Table 5).
Mouse alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S (ATCC CRL-2019)
that possesses characteristics very close to those of the primary
AMs was used to study the effect of the secretome eluate in
terms of cytokine expression profile and cellular damage. One
day prior to stimulation, 5 × 106 macrophage cells were seeded
in each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing RPMI
medium (1 mL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). The adhered cells were stimulated with the test antigen
preparation at a final concentration of 5 µg/mL. MH-S cells
treated with the same volume of phosphate buffered saline
(negative control) and commercial bacterial lipopolysaccharide
LPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, Cat. no L-4130) at a concentration
of 1 µg/mL (positive control) were used for comparison. The
treated cell cultures were harvested at 4, 24, and 48 h intervals
during incubation for monitoring the induction of cytokines
and cellular changes (in terms of cell viability, lactate dehy-
drogenase, nitric oxide, caspase 3).
Viable cell count was determined using Trypan Blue staining
method (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Cytotoxicity was measured
based on release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using the
CytoTox 96 kit (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Nitric oxide (NO) production was
measured as nitrite using Griess reagent (Promega, Madison,
WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The nitrite
concentration was calculated as micromolar (µM) using a
NaNO2 standard curve, prepared for the purpose as described
previously.28 Caspase activity was measured using the pro-glow
caspase-3/7 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) per manufac-
turer’s specifications. All activities were measured using a
microtiter plate reader (Wallac Victor2 Multilabel Counter
Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).
RNA Isolation and Cytokine Analysis. Total RNA was
extracted from the macrophage cells using TRI Reagent (Mo-
lecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Expression levels for the individual
cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and TNF-R were measured
by one-step quantitative real time RT-PCR using Brilliant II
SYBR Green QRT-PCR 1-Step Master Mix (Stratagene, Ceder
Creek, TX) in ABI 7500 PCR thermal cycler. The reaction
conditions for the RT-PCR were as follows: RT reaction at 50
°C for 30 min followed by 40 cycles of PCR amplification
(denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 53 °C for 45 s, and
extension at 72 °C for 35 s). Sequences of the PCR primers used
in this study are listed in Table 1. The reaction mixture
contained 5 µL of the 2× master mix, 0.75 µL each (15 ng) of
the forward and reverse primers, 1 µL of a 1:40 dilution of the
reference dye, one unit of the enzyme, and 100 ng of the
extracted RNA. Volume of the reaction mixture was made to
10 µL using distilled water. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for the
cytokines were normalized against -actin. The fold change in
gene expression was calculated according to the published
method29 using the following formula: Fold-change ) 2∆∆Ct,
where Ct is the threshold cycle, ∆Ct is the difference between
the Ct values of the target gene and the internal control gene

for the vehicle control cells and the treated cells.
Statistical Analysis. The functional evaluation data were
statistically analyzed and the results are expressed as means

the groups was determined by one-way ANOVA using SPSS
(16th version). Significance was accepted at p e 0.05.
Results
Optimization of Separation and Identification of Immu-
nogenic Proteins in M. immunogenum. Multiple immun-
odominant protein spots were detected in the individual
subcellular protein fractions of M. immunogenum when ana-
lyzed on regular (one-dimensional) SDS-PAGE combined with
immunoblotting (data not shown). However, the hybridizing
protein spots on the Western blots were too confluent to allow
complete resolution of the corresponding individual immuno-
genic proteins for further identification. Hence, for better
resolution to allow definitive identification of each of these
proteins, the protein fractions were resolved on 2D-gels using
immobiline dry IEF strips (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). For
initial standardization purposes, proteins in the test fractions
were separated on 7 cm IEF strips with a pH range of 3-10
before separation in the second dimension using SDS-PAGE.
Most of the proteins were found clustered around the 4-7 pH
range. Hence, our further proteomic separations were per-
formed using IEF strips of pH range 4-7. Up to 300 distinct
protein spots were visualized in the second-dimension gel
(SDS-PAGE) for each protein fraction (cytosolic, cell membrane,
cell wall, and secretory) (Figure 1A-D). Over 50 protein spots
from different fractions showed distinct immunoreactivity on
the Western blots (Figure 2). Of these, 33 were conclusively
identified based on mass peak profiling of the tryptic-digested
peptides using MALDI-TOF. MASCOT search results on the
identified proteins are presented in Tables 2-5.
Mycobacterial Antigen Homologues. Of the identified 33
immunogenic proteins, the following eight proteins showed
homology with the known protein antigens reported in other
species of mycobacteria: heat shock protein GroEL (60 kDa
chaperonin 2), glycine-rich proteins PE-PGRS and PPE, L-
asparaginase, polyketide synthase (PKS), antigen 85A (Ag85A),
superoxide dismutase (SOD), and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu).
Novel Mycobacterial Antigens. The other 25 of the 33
identified immunogenic proteins represented novel mycobac-
terial antigens. The majority of these 25 immunogenic proteins
along with the 8 antigen homologues listed above could be
categorized as those involved in the following biological
functions (Figure 3): cell division (protein kinase G designated
as PknG), stress (chaperonic heat shock protein GroEL, super-
oxide dismutase), cation transportation (CtpA), proton trans-
portation (ATP synthase subunits alpha, beta, and delta), fatty
acid metabolism (fatty acid CoA ligase, polyketide synthase),
DNA replication (ATP-dependent helicase), DNA repair (RecD),
biosynthesis of different cell components (UDP-N-acetylmu-
ramoylalanyl-D-glutamate-2, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase
OtsB, molybdopterin biosynthesis protein MoeY, L-Asparagi-
nase, antigen 85A), protein synthesis (aspartate tRNA ligase,
EF-Tu), and signal transduction (sensor histidine kinase SenX3,
Ser/Thr-protein kinase PknF). The remaining 11 of the 25
immunoreactive proteins showed homology to either unidenti-
fied membrane proteins or hypothetical proteins (unannotated)
in the mycobacterial database (Figure 3). Interestingly, some
of the 25 novel antigen candidates showed homology with
virulence factors reported in different pathogenic bacterial
species including mycobacteria. For instance, Ser/Thr-protein
kinases PknF and PknG48 have been reported as virulence
factors in mycobacteria, but their identity as antigens has not
been known.
Functional Analysis of the Major Secretome Fraction of
M. immunogenum. Evaluation of the secretome eluate (the
major secretome fraction eluted from the 2D-gel) for its
interactions with alveolar macrophages is presented in Figures
4 and 5. In this context, expression of the cytokines IL-, IL-6,
IL-18, and TNF-R was found to be up-regulated (Figure 4) on
stimulation with the secretome eluate and the control antigen
(LPS) unlike the expression of IL-10 that showed down-
regulation (Figure 4C) in both the test and LPS control assays.
Expression of IL-6 peaked at 4 h followed by a gradual decline,
whereas that of other cytokines (IL-, IL-18, TNF-R) showed a
gradual increase, peaking at the later stages of incubation (24
or 48 h).
In terms of the cellular effects on the alveolar macrophages
as compared to LPS (positive control) and the vehicle
(negative control), the secretome eluate caused minimal loss
of cell viability (Figure 5B) and marginal induction of caspase
3 expression (Figure 5D) in the secretome-treated macroph-
ages as compared to the vehicle-treated macrophages. In
contrast, nitric oxide (NO) production (Figure 5C) and LDH
release (Figure 5A) were significantly (P e 0.05) increased
at both 24 and 48 h post-treatment in the secretome-treated
macrophages as compared to the vehicle-treated cells.
Discussion
Immunoproteomic analysis of the secretory and cellular
subfractions of M. immunogenum proteome led to the
identification of 33 antigenic proteins (8 homologues and
25 novel antigens) from an array of more than 50 distinctly
immunoreactive spots. Interestingly, a sizable fraction (34%)
of the identified antigens matched the unannotated hypo-
thetical proteins in the mycobacterial database representing
hitherto unnamed novel proteins (Figure 3). Unlike the
subcellular fractions, the secretome fraction did not resolve
as efficiently into individual spots in our initial efforts (Figure
1D). Nevertheless, in subsequent efforts during the writing
of this report, a better resolution of the secretome proteins
was achieved by using further improvements in our meth-

of the secretory fraction based on use of the modified separation conditions. Briefly, a larger size (24 cm) IPG strip pH 4-7 was used
for the IEF step using 400 µg of protein aliquot of the secretory fraction and a precast 4-20% gradient gel (Jule, Inc., Milford, CT)
instead of a linear gel was applied for the second-dimension separation step.

Mycobacterial Antigen Homologues. Understanding the
existing structural and functional information on the known
mycobacterial antigens, for which the homologues have been
identified in M. immunogenum, may likely provide an insight
into the physiology of production and likely role of these
detected antigen homologues in this newly recognized
species. For instance, heat shock protein GroEL, also referred
to as HSP60 or 65-kDa antigen or 60 kDa chaperonin 2, has
been reported as a common stress protein30,31 expressed in
response to heat shock in mycobacteria. It is up-regulated
in the intracellular postphagocytosis environment as com-
pared to the in vitro growth conditions.
SOD plays an important role in conversion of oxygen free
radical superoxide (O2-) to hydrogen peroxide and molecular
oxygen.32,33 It protects mycobacteria from oxidative stress and
contributes to their survival and establishment inside the host.
This enzyme is extracellularly secreted during growth for
combating the protective oxidative stress response of the
host.34,35
PPE and PE-PGRS belong to the glycine-rich PE (Pro-Glu)
and PPE (Pro-Pro-Glu) protein families; these are two
multigene families of unknown function, constituting around
10% of the genome in M. tuberculosis. The two families are

the genome of the laboratory strain H37Rv and are the likely
source of antigenic variation in the mycobacterial genome.
Several members of these glycine-rich multigene protein
families are either expressed upon infection of macrophages
or when grown under low pH and stress conditions.36
Antigen 85A is a member of the antigen 85 complex that
comprises of three closely related extracellularly secreted
enzymes, antigen 85A, antigen 85B and antigen 85C, with
demonstrated immunogenicity. Antigen 85 complex has a role
in mycolyl-transferase activity and helps in the formation of
cell wall.37

Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) belongs to a superfamily of
GTP-binding proteins that have GTPase activity. It is known
to form a complex with aminoacyl-tRNA and elongation factor
Ts (EF-Ts), bind with the ribosomes, and help in protein
synthesis.38 Young and co-workers39 proposed a nutrient-
dependent methylation of EF-Tu in Escherichia coli, with a role
in regulation of growth.
Polyketide synthases are involved in the synthesis of long-
chain alpha-pyrones that are components of the complex lipid-
rich mycobacterial cell wall. These complex lipids are formed
by the combined action of fatty acid synthase and polyketide
synthase.40
L-asparaginase catalyzes the conversion of L-asparagine into
L-asparatate and ammonia. It is expressed intracellularly in the
stationary cultures of Mycobacterium phlei and other myco-
bacterial species grown in Sauton’s medium or salts-gluconase-
glutamate medium.41 In some bacterial species, it is secreted
out into the culture medium.42
Novel Antigens. Over half of the novel antigens matched
other mycobacterial or bacterial proteins known to be involved
in different cellular functions such as lipid transport and
metabolism, ion transport, protein synthesis, energy produc-
tion, biosynthesis and modification of cell wall components,
cellular structure, transport and metabolism of amino acids,
cell signaling, and virulence. For instance, SenX3 is a part of
the mycobacterial SenX3-RegX3 two-component system.43 It
helps in the transduction of different stress signals inside the
cell. Cytosolic portion of the protein autophosphorylates before

TNF-R. Change in cytokine expression was measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR and calculated as fold-change in gene expression
relative to -actin using the 2∆∆CT method as described in Material and Methods. Mean fold-change in gene expression from the triplicates
is plotted on the Y-axis. Treatments of MH-S cells with a commercial bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS (1 µg/mL) and the vehicle (PBS)
were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, for comparison. Statistical significance (P e 0.05) of the fold-change data is
indicated by an asterisk (*).

mediating phosphorylation of the response regulator protein
RegX3.43 This protein has a crucial role in survival of bacteria
inside the macrophage as well as in the in vivo environment.44
The two-component system (SenX3-RegX3) also regulates the
gene expression in mycobacteria in a phosphate-dependent
manner.45
Detection of protein kinase F (PknF) in M. immunogenum,
a rapidly growing mycobacterial species, is interesting consid-
ering that this protein has been previously reported to occur
in the member species of slow-growing mycobacteria (SGM)
but not in rapidly growing mycobacteria species (RGM) such
as Mycobacterium smegmatis. It is a transmembrane protein
that has been shown to play a role in the regulation of glucose
transport, cell growth, and septum formation inMycobacterium
tuberculosis.46,47 Protein kinase G (pknG) is an important drug
target in mycobacteria. This protein is secreted by the patho-
genic mycobacterial species inside the phagosome compart-
ment of macrophages. It inhibits phagosome-lysosome fusion
and helps in intracellular survival of the pathogenic mycobac-
teria.48
Three subunits (alpha, beta and delta) of F1F0-ATP synthase
were detected in our analysis on M. immunogenum. F1F0-ATP
synthase complex plays an important role in various cellular
processes in bacterial cells.11,49 This system is a potent drug
target in M. tuberculosis, which can be inhibited by diaryl-
quinoline.50,51 With the use of a knockout mutation of the beta
subunit of F1Fo-ATP synthase, it has been demonstrated that
this protein is essential for the growth of M. smegmatis on
fermentable and nonfermentable carbon sources.52 Acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase is a flavoprotein which catalyzes the desatu-
ration of acyl-CoA esters and plays an important role in the
oxidation of fatty acyl-CoA esters.53
Lipoprotein LppW is an alanine-rich protein that was
recently reported from the culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis.54
UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamate catalyzes peptide
bond formation between UDP N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine
and D-glutamate.55 Long chain fatty acid-CoA ligases share
homology with the protein fatty acid-CoA ligase FadD which
is involved in the synthesis of complex lipids in mycobacteria.
These complex lipids are present on the cell surface of
pathogenic mycobacteria and play an important role in their
virulence mechanisms.56 Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase
OtsB (osmoregulatory trehalose synthesis B) is involved in the
synthesis of trehalose from glucose-6-phosphate and UDP-
glucose through the OtsA-OtsB pathway.57,58 This protein is
up-regulated under stress conditions in E. coli.59 Other myco-
bacteria species are also known to have homologues of OtsA
and OtsB; their activity was demonstrated in the cell-free
extracts of M. smegmatis and M. bovis BCG.60 OtsA-OtsB
pathway is crucial for the growth of M. smegmatis as shown
by the OtsA mutants that were unable to proliferate and enter
the stationary phase.61
Immunogenicity of the Secretome Proteins of M. immu-
nogenum. For immune response studies, the secretome eluate
(containing a mixture of major secretory proteins) was used
instead of the individual secreted proteins, for two reasons, to

(B) loss of cell viability as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion method; (C) nitric oxide (NO) production, (D) Caspase 3/7 activation
measured as relative luminescence unit (RLU). Treatment of the MH-S cells with LPS (1 µg/mL) was used as a positive control for
comparison. The treatments using the secretome antigen eluate (5 µg/mL) and LPS (1 µg/mL) were performed as described in the
Materials and Methods. Asterisk on the bar indicates statistical significance (P e 0.05) of the value with respect to the value of the
vehicle-treated control group.

test whether the secretome proteins of M. immunogenum as a
whole have a role in inducing host innate immune response,
and to perform a reliable immunogenicity assay, considering
the insufficient concentration and poor resolution of the few
individual protein spots. Use of alveolar macrophages as the
immune cell type for this analysis is consistent with the
established practice in mycobacterial immune response
studies.62-64 The cytokine expression patterns of the secretome-
treated macrophage cells were comparable with those of the
LPS-treated cells; proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-
18 and TNF-R) were up-regulated, whereas the antiproinflam-
matory cytokine IL-10 was down-regulated. Our LPS results
corroborated with the previous observations that expression
of IL-6 is greater than the other proinflammatory cytokines
(TNF-R and IL-1) in LPS-treated cells,65 providing authenticity
to the experimental conditions used and the patterns of
cytokine expression observed in this study. Up-regulation of
TNF-R in the treated alveolar macrophages is consistent with
a similar immunological response reported for the other
antigenic secretory proteins such as Ag 85B and ESAT6 from
other species of mycobacteria.63,66,67 The ability of the secre-
tome proteins of M. immunogenum to induce the observed
cytokine patterns implies their likely role in inducing inflam-
mation. Additionally, one could expect other specific roles of
these proteins attributable to the induced cytokines TNF-R,68-72
IL-1,73-75 IL-6,76-79 IL-1868,80-82 as observed in studies on
mycobacterial pathogenesis using other species.
Cellular Effects of the Secretome Proteins of M. immu-
nogenum.While the secretome eluate proteins caused minimal
change in macrophage cell viability, the cells showed some
cytotoxicity and the nitric oxide (NO) production was signifi-
cantly increased. Considering that NO is produced due to the
activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in inflamma-
tory macrophages,72-83 it is likely that the secretory antigens
may have caused iNOS-mediated up-regulation of NO.
Proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide induced by the
secretory proteins of M. immunogenum may be the likely
contributing factors to hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like symp-
toms in the industrial workers exposed to this pathogen.
However, further detailed studies are needed to confirm this
hypothesis.
Conclusions
This is the first report on identification of individual protein
antigens in the nontuberculous mycobacterial species M.
immunogenum, a species that is receiving increasing attention
as an etiological agent of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in
machine workers. The study also provides first evidence on the
immunological potential of secretome proteins in this myco-
bacterial species. Some of the antigen proteins identified in
this study are homologues of the potent antigens reported in
other species of mycobacteria or in other bacterial species.
Particularly, the identified homologues of the two mycobac-
terial antigens HSP60 and antigen 85A, currently being used
in TB diagnosis, could be further characterized to identify M.
immunogenum-specific epitope(s) for diagnostic applications
in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Importantly, this study has led
to the identification of novel antigenic proteins showing
homology either with other functional proteins in different
bacterial pathogens with a role in their virulence or survival
under stress conditions, or with hitherto unannotated proteins
in the mycobacterial database. Such species-specific antigens
identified in this study may pave the way for understanding
the immunogenicity and pathogenesis mechanisms of M.
immunogenum and developing tools for the diagnosis of
mycobacterial-HP patients and/or exposed workers in the
occupational settings. Similar applications are expected in
nosocomial infections with this species.
