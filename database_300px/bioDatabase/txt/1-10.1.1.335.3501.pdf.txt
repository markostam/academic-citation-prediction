Abstract The formation of hepatic bile requires that water
be transported across liver epithelia. Rat hepatocytes ex-
press three aquaporins (AQPs): AQP8, AQP9, and AQP0.
Recognizing that cholesterol and sphingolipids are thought
to promote the assembly of proteins into specialized mem-
brane microdomains, we hypothesized that canalicular bile
secretion involves the trafficking of vesicles to and from
localized lipid-enriched microdomains in the canalicular
plasma membrane. Hepatocyte plasma membranes were
sonicated in Triton and centrifuged overnight on a sucrose
gradient to yield a Triton-soluble pellet and a Triton-insolu-
ble, sphingolipid-enriched microdomain fraction at the
5%/30% sucrose interface. The detergent-insoluble portion
of the hepatocyte plasma membrane was enriched in alka-
line phosphatase (a microdomain-positive marker) and de-
void of amino-peptidase N (a microdomain-negative marker),
enriched in caveolin, both AQP8 and AQP9, but negative
for clathrin. The microdomain fractions contained chlo-
ride-bicarbonate anion exchanger isoform 2 and multidrug
resistance-associated protein 2. Exposure of isolated hepa-
tocytes to glucagon increased the expression of AQP8 but
not AQP9 in the microdomain fractions. Sphingolipid anal-
ysis of the insoluble fraction showed the predominant
species to be sphingomyelin.  These data support the pres-
ence of sphingolipid-enriched microdomains of the hepato-
cyte membrane that represent potential localized target ar-
eas for the clustering of AQPs and functionally related
proteins involved in canalicular bile secretion.

Canalicular bile is formed by the osmotic filtration of
water in response to osmotic gradients generated by active
transport systems located at the apical and basolateral
membranes of the hepatocyte. In recent years, consider-
able progress has been made in clarifying the molecular
 
mechanisms of canalicular bile secretion because many of
the transporters, channels, and exchangers involved have
been cloned and functionally characterized (1). Impaired
transport of key proteins into bile and the consequent loss
of osmotic driving forces for bile secretion can result in
cholestasis (1).
Work from our laboratory has described an important
role for the water channel proteins, aquaporins (AQPs),
in the transcellular transport of water during primary bile
secretion by hepatocytes. Hepatocytes express three water
channels (AQP8, AQP9, and AQP0) that are differentially
localized and trafficked. In the basal state, AQP8 is present
in intracellular vesicles; however, in response to a choler-
etic agonist, AQP8 is redistributed to the canalicular plasma
membrane, where it facilitates the transport of water
across the hepatocyte epithelial barrier in concert with
AQP9, which is constitutively expressed on the basolateral
plasma membrane (2). More recently, we reported that
translocation of AQP8-containing vesicles to the apical
membrane of hepatocytes is triggered by glucagon via a
cAMP-dependent mechanism involving microtubules, data
suggesting that this process plays a key role in hormone-
induced canalicular bile secretion (3, 4).
The usefulness of detergent solubilization for isolating
and characterizing integral membrane proteins was first
described more than 30 years ago (5, 6). Detergents can
also differentially solubilize membrane domains with dif-
ferent lipid and protein compositions (7–9). Differences
in detergent solubility may arise for proteins with single as
opposed to multiple membrane-spanning domains. The
former are expected to fit better in tightly packed do-
mains than are the latter, which require more flexibility
for proper membrane accommodation. Triton-insoluble
membrane domains are composed of sphingolipid-choles-
terol-enriched regions arranged in a tightly packed, liq-
uid-ordered state. The significance of this arrangement of
packed lipids within a membrane, and the affinity of cer-
tain proteins and lipids for specific membrane regions or

Sphingolipid-enriched microdomains of the hepatocyte membrane 1427
 
domains, have been proposed to play important physio-
logical roles in processes as diverse as cell surface signal-
ing, cell adhesion and motility, and intracellular sorting
(7, 10, 11). Detergent insolubility, specifically with Triton
X-100, is accepted as one of several useful tools for study-
ing cellular membranes and their characteristics.
Our objectives here were to isolate and characterize lipid-
enriched microdomains in freshly isolated rat hepatocyte
plasma membranes and to begin to explore their role in
canalicular bile secretion. In the studies described, we used
a variety of biochemical approaches and provide evidence
that Triton-insoluble microdomains exist in hepatocyte
plasma membranes, are enriched in caveolin, cholesterol,
and sphingomyelin, and also contain AQP8 and AQP9, mul-
tidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), and anion
exchanger isoform 2 (AE2). In addition, glucagon increases
the expression of AQP8 in the microdomain fraction. These
data are consistent with the notion that specific micro-
domains present in the hepatocyte plasma membrane
may be involved in canalicular bile secretion.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
 
Isolation of hepatocytes and hepatocyte
plasma membranes
 
Highly purified (
 

 
98%) rat hepatocytes were isolated as de-
scribed previously (12). Briefly, livers were perfused with oxygen-
ated HEPES buffer containing 0.02% EGTA (Sigma) to remove
blood cells and then transferred to a temperature-controlled
chamber at 37
 

 
C and perfused with HEPES buffer solution con-
taining 0.45 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemi-
cals). After perfusion, the hepatocytes were gently removed from
the biliary tree by mechanical disruption and filtered twice
through 40 
 

 
m nylon mesh. The hepatocytes were purified fur-
ther by isopycnic centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll
gradient (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times in
Liebovitz’s L-15 medium (Invitrogen). As confirmed previously,
cell viability was greater than 90% as assessed by trypan blue ex-
clusion, and polarity was maintained during the time of the ex-
periments (2, 13, 14).
Plasma membranes were prepared from freshly isolated hepa-
tocytes as described previously by us (13, 14). Briefly, hepatocytes
were washed and sonicated in 0.3 M sucrose containing 0.01%
soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
and 0.1 mM leupeptin (Sigma). The mixed plasma membrane
fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 200,000 
 
g
 
 for 60 min
on a discontinuous 1.3 M sucrose gradient. The plasma mem-
brane preparations for hepatocytes have been characterized ex-
tensively for marker and organelle studies by us (2).
 
Isolation of hepatocyte plasma membrane microdomains
 
Isolation of hepatocyte plasma membrane microdomains was
performed by solubilization in nonionic detergent followed by
separation by buoyant density centrifugation using a modifica-
tion of methods applied in other epithelia (15). Hepatocyte
mixed plasma membranes were lysed and solubilized by sonica-
tion in MES-buffered saline (25 mM MES and 150 mM NaCl, pH
6.5) containing 0.5% nonionic detergent (Triton X-100) at 4
 

 
C
and adjusted to 40% (w/v) sucrose by the addition of 80% (w/v)
sucrose. Aliquots (3 ml) of mixed plasma membrane were then
layered under a 0–30% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged
for 20 h at 140,000 
 
g
 
. This preparation yielded a Triton-soluble
pellet in the 40% sucrose region and a low-density, Triton-insolu-
ble band located at the 5%/30% sucrose interface, consistent
with findings generated in other epithelia (15). The gradient was
fractionated into 10 aliquots (1 ml each), and each fraction was
assayed for protein content, opacity, and the activity of positive
and negative microdomain marker enzymes.
 
Characterization of gradient fractionated hepatocyte 
plasma membranes
 
Each of the 10 fractions from the 0–30% sucrose gradient was
assayed for total protein (Bio-Rad) and spectrophotometric ab-
sorbance at 620 nm (a measurement of microdomain-positive
opacity). In addition, each fraction was assayed for alkaline phos-
phatase, an accepted microdomain-positive marker, using a com-
mercially prepared kit (Sigma), and amino-peptidase N, an
accepted negative marker (15), using a colorimetric method de-
scribed previously by Goldbarg and Rutenburg (16).
 
Membrane lipid analysis
 
Total membrane cholesterol and phospholipids were mea-
sured spectrophotometrically on each of 10 fractions from the
0–30% sucrose gradient using commercially available kits (Wako
Chemicals, Inc., Richmond, VA) according to the protocol sup-
plied by the manufacturer.
 
Sphingolipid analysis
 
Lipid standards were obtained from Matrya, Inc. (Pleasant
Gap, PA), and Calibochem. Silica gel G60 plates for thin-layer
chromatography were purchased from Merck. Samples were pre-
pared for lipid analysis by extraction as described previously (17–
19). Fractions from the sucrose gradient were sonicated (5 min,
room temperature), and an aliquot was removed for protein de-
termination using Bradford analysis. The samples were then ex-
tracted with CHCl

crodomain fraction. Gradient fractions (1 ml each) from the 5–30%
linear sucrose gradient were collected for characterization.

Immunoblotting of gradient fractionated hepatocyte 
plasma membranes
 
We performed immunoblotting using specific antibodies to
caveolin-1 (a cholesterol binding protein associated with mem-
brane microdomains of many polarized cells) and clathrin (a
non-microdomain-associated protein); both antibodies were pro-
vided by Dr. Mark McNiven. In addition, we performed immuno-
blot analysis of each fraction for the water channel proteins
AQP8, AQP9, and AQP0 using commercially available antibodies
from Alpha Diagnostic International as described previously (2)
and for AE2 (Santa Cruz) and MRP2 (Alexis Biochemicals).
Fractions were exposed to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-poly-
acrylamide gel and transferred overnight to nitrocellulose. After
exposure to specific primary and secondary antibodies, protein
bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence de-
tection system (ECL-Plus; Amersham Biosciences). In a separate
set of experiments, freshly isolated hepatocytes were exposed to

RESULTS
Rat hepatocyte plasma membrane microdomains were
fractionated after exposure to Triton flotation on sucrose
gradients and characterized using biochemical marker
assays and immunoblotting according to published proto-
cols for plasma membrane (2, 13, 14) and microdomain
(15) isolation. The scheme is displayed in (
 
Fig. 1
 
). Ten
fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the bottom of
the gradient (fraction 1) to the top of the gradient (frac-
tion 10). The gradient revealed a Triton-soluble pellet
that we term the “nonmicrodomain” component in the
40% sucrose region and a low-density, Triton-insoluble,
lipid-enriched microdomain band (fractions 5 and 6) lo-
cated at the 5%/30% sucrose interface. Each fraction of
the gradient (from 1 to 10) was assayed for protein con-
tent, opacity, and the activity of positive (alkaline phos-
phatase) and negative (amino-peptidase N) microdomain
marker enzymes. As shown in 
 
Fig. 2
 
, fractions 5/6 showed
an absorbance peak of 620 nm, indicating positive opacity,
were enriched in alkaline phosphatase (a positive marker),
and were devoid of amino-peptidase N (a negative marker).
The Triton-insoluble, lipid-enriched microdomain fractions

protein.
 
Table 1
 
 shows the results of membrane lipid analysis for
each of the 10 gradient fractions. The cholesterol content
and cholesterol-phospholipid ratio were highest in frac-
tions 5/6 (representing the putative microdomains). The
cholesterol-phospholipid ratios of 0.97 and 0.84, in frac-
tions 5 and 6, respectively, are characteristic of a very stiff
membrane and one of the important parameters affecting
membrane fluidity.

One of the predominant sphingolipid subspecies and the

lar quantitation exists in hepatocytes or other epithelial

(a non-microdomain-associated protein) was negative in
all fractions of the gradient. In the blots for both AQP8
(34 kDa) and AQP9 (28 kDa), bands were observed corre-
sponding to the microdomain fractions. AQP0 was present
in the gradient pellet but was not observed in the micro-
domain fractions. Bands for AE2 and MRP2 were also ob-
served at their appropriate molecular masses and en-
riched in the microdomain fractions. These data support
the concept that water channel proteins (AQPs) associate
with or cluster in a sphingolipid-enriched microdomain
portion of the membrane and may also cluster with other
functionally associated proteins that, together, provide the
solute and ions to facilitate the production of bile.
 
Figure 5
 
 shows comparative immunoblots for the distri-
bution and expression of both AQP8 and AQP9 in the mi-
crodomain fractions isolated in the basal state and after
pretreatment of hepatocytes with glucagon. The immuno-
blot fractions were analyzed by densitometric scanning,
and the relative densitometry units of fractions 5 and 6
(representing the microdomain-associated fractions) were
pooled, expressing the basal condition as 100%. After
treatment of hepatocytes with glucagon, AQP8 (an ago-
nist-regulated AQP) was increased in the microdomain
fractions (5 and 6) by 3.7-fold compared with the same
fractions in the basal condition, whereas AQP9 (nonregu-
lated) was unchanged.
DISCUSSION
The key finding reported here relates to the isolation
and characterization of sphingolipid-enriched microdo-
mains of the plasma membrane of rat hepatocytes. We
found that regions of the hepatocyte plasma membrane
fractionated by isopycnic centrifugation had the following
characteristics: 
 
i
 
) Triton insolubility; 
 
ii
 
) enrichment in
cholesterol and sphingomyelin; 
 
iii
 
) the presence of caveo-
lin; 
 
iv
 
) contained the water channel proteins AQP8 and
AQP9 as well as AE2 and MRP2; and 
 
v
 
) exposure of hepa-
tocytes to glucagon increased the expression of AQP8 in
the microdomain-associated fractions. Collectively, these
data support the notion that there are distinct membrane
microdomains on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes,
to which functionally related “flux proteins” (14) for wa-
ter, ions, and solutes involved in canalicular bile secretion
may be targeted and physically clustered.
Our data are in general agreement with those in model
systems from several other cell types, including cultured
MDCK cells, fibroblasts, cerebral cortex, and intestinal ep-
ithelia (8, 15). In each case, the low-density, detergent-
insoluble membrane fraction was strongly opaque at 620
nm, with the bulk of the protein in the soluble regions of
the gradient and detergent-insoluble fractions containing
the putative microdomains, which constitute 6–18% of the
protein yield. As in our results, amino-peptidase N (a non-

described in Experimental Procedures. Representative immunoblots for fractions of the microdomain gradi-
ent in both the basal and glucagon conditions are shown as well as relative densitometric analysis for both
AQP8 and AQP9. The mean densitometry of fractions 4 and 5 (representing the microdomain fractions) of
the basal condition (control, 100%) is plotted versus glucagon treatment. To obtain sufficient protein for the

Tietz et al. Sphingolipid-enriched microdomains of the hepatocyte membrane 1431
microdomain protein) in each study was found exclusively
in the first few fractions of the sucrose gradients. In addi-
tion, we have extended these findings by making the ob-
servation that the water channel proteins AQP8 and
AQP9, AE2, and MRP2 are enriched in the sphingolipid-
enriched microdomain fractions of the plasma mem-
brane, consistent with their role in regulated canalicular
bile flow. Our observation that caveolin is present in the
microdomain fraction is reasonable based on the known
interaction of caveolae and sphingolipids. Caveolae, the
flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that
contain the coat protein caveolin, have been implicated in
cell signaling and the uptake of small molecules, and they
function as signal transduction centers. The sphingolipid-
rich microdomain portion of a membrane forms an annu-
lus around the neck of the caveolae, thereby implying a
direct association between the two and substantiating a
potential role in targeting at the canalicular membrane of
hepatocytes.
Our data showed the highest cholesterol and phospho-
lipid values in the detergent-insoluble fractions of the gra-
dient, supporting the concept that these microdomains
have an ordered structure. The cholesterol-phospholipid
ratio of nearly 1.0 observed in these same fractions of the
hepatocyte plasma membrane represents a stiff portion of
the membrane, a biophysical property that should facili-
tate the clustering of specific molecules in these regions.
The clustering of cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, glyco-
sylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, and other pro-
teins in distinct domains within membranes facilitates mo-
lecular interactions and provides potential target regions
by bringing molecules into close association and/or in-
creasing the local concentration of specific molecules that
are required for specialized cellular functions. Sphingo-
myelin was the most abundant sphingolipid subspecies
found in the microdomain fraction; these are the first de-
tailed data characterizing phospholipids in hepatic epi-
thelia and confirming the prominence of sphingomyelin,
a microdomain characteristic lipid.
In two recent studies by separate investigators (21, 22),
the model of cultured polarized hepatocytes is described
as an unresolved model in which to study lipid micro-
domains and their role in the trafficking of proteins to the
apical membrane. Hepatocytes are described to represent
a case in which distinct lipid microdomains operate in
both the direct and indirect apical transport of resident
proteins (21, 22). To date, sorting principles and polar-
ized trafficking have been largely described in MDCK
cells. Although these cells are abundant and easy to work
with, the extrapolation of these findings to water trans-
port in hepatocytes should be regarded with caution.
We found that AQP8 and AQP9 were present primarily
in fractions 5 and 6, those regions of the hepatocyte
plasma membrane that were Triton-insoluble, that con-
tained a very high cholesterol-phospholipid ratio and ca-
veolin, and that were enriched in sphingomyelin. These
novel observations are important because they are the first
data in any cell type that show AQPs to be localized to spe-
cific regions of the plasma membrane, a finding compati-
ble with our hypothesis that specific regions of the plasma
membrane may serve as target areas for the insertion (i.e.,
AQP8) or constitutive expression (i.e., AQP9) of proteins
involved in canalicular bile secretion. The observation
that glucagon caused an increase in the expression of
AQP8 in the Triton-soluble, nonmicrodomain fractions
(1–3) supports and complements our previous findings
related to the hormone-regulated membrane insertion of
AQP8 in hepatocytes (4) and the observation that gluca-
gon induces a redistribution of AQP8 from intracellular
vesicles to the plasma membrane (3). The observation
that AQP8 (but not AQP9) is significantly and specifically
increased in the sphingolipid-enriched microdomain-
associated fractions (5 and 6) after exposure to glucagon is
novel and extends the hypothesis that canalicular bile se-
cretion results in part from agonist-induced insertion and
clustering of AQP8 into specific regions or microdomains
of the plasma membrane.
To extend our findings, we observed AE2 and MRP2 in
the microdomain fraction. It is reasonable to speculate
that the agonist-responsive vesicles in hepatocytes that
contain AQP8 likely contain other molecules, such as AE2
and MRP2, necessary to establish the osmotic gradients
that drive the passive movement of water, because both
proteins participate in bile secretion and their targeting
can be stimulated by cAMP (23, 24, 25). In addition to ge-
netic defects, the study of the normal and altered traffick-
ing of hepatocellular transport systems and the role of
lipid-enriched microdomains involved in bile secretion
may provide a molecular correlate for the functional
changes that occur in cholestasis.
