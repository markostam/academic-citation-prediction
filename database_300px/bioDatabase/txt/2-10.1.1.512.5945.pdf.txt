ABSTRACT
Signal transducer and activator of transcription
6 (STAT6) is a regulator of transcription for
interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced genes. The ability of
STAT6 to activate transcription depends on func-
tional interaction with other transcription factors
and coactivators. We have characterized the mecha-
nism of STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation
by identifying STAT6 transcription activation domain
(TAD) interacting nuclear proteins. The first of the
identified proteins was coactivator protein p100,
which regulates IL-4-induced transcription by con-
necting STAT6 with other transcriptional regulators.
Here, we describe RNA helicase A (RHA) as a novel
component of STAT6 transcriptosome. In vitro and
in vivo experiments indicated that RHA did not
directly interact with STAT6, but p100 protein was
found to mediate the assembly of the ternary
complex of STAT6-p100-RHA. In chromatin immuno-
precipitation studies RHA together with p100
enhanced the binding of STAT6 on the human Ig«
promoter after IL-4 stimulation. RHA enhanced the
IL-4-induced transcription, and the participation of
RHA in IL-4-regulated transcription was supported
by RNAi experiments. Our results suggest that RHA
has an important role in the assembly of STAT6
transcriptosome. As RHA is also known to interact
with chromatin modifying proteins, the RHA con-
taining protein complexes may facilitate the entry
of transcriptional apparatus to the IL-4 responsive
promoters.
INTRODUCTION
Regulation of transcription is dependent both on general
transcription factors as well as transcriptional activators
and coactivators. These proteins are assembled into a nucleo-
protein complex called the enhanceosome (1–3). In the
enhanceosome transcriptional coactivators form multifunc-
tional protein–protein complexes, which are assembled in a
modular fashion, connect DNA-binding sequence-specific
regulators to the basal transcription machinery, and facilitate
chromatin remodelling and modifications (4,5).
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6)
has an important role in regulation of interleukin-4 (IL-4)-
induced gene responses. IL-4 has pleiotropic effects on the
immune system. It induces activated B lymphocytes to prolif-
erate and to synthesize IgE and IgG1, and T cells to differen-
tiate towards Th2 cells (6–8). IL-4 has also an important role
in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy. IL-4 stimulation
results in activation of JAK1 and JAK3 tyrosine kinases,
which in turn phosphorylate and activate STAT6 monomers.
Phosphorylated STAT6 molecules dimerize and translocate
into the nucleus, where they bind to the specific recognition
sequences in the promoters of IL-4 responsive genes.
The ability of STAT6 to activate transcription is dependent
on the cooperation with other transcription factors and coac-
tivators on the IL-4 responsive promoters. STAT6 has been
shown to cooperate with NF-kB, PU.1, IRF-4, BSAP and
C/EBPb transcription factors (9–14). The mechanisms of
this interplay vary, e.g. C/EBPb stabilizes the DNA-binding
of STAT6, whereas NF-kB and PU.1 are required for tran-
scriptional activation of STAT6. In addition, transcriptional
coregulators for STAT6 have been identified, such as the
CREB-binding protein (CBP), which acts as a coactivator
for numerous transcription factors including all the STAT
proteins (15–20). CBP/p300 stimulates the transcription of
target genes by several mechanisms; CBP/p300 regulates
chromatin remodelling through intrinsic histone acetyltrans-
ferase activity (21,22) and it also associates with p/CAF,
another histone acetyltransferase (23). In addition, CBP/
p300 can act as a coactivator by bridging transcription factors
to basal transcription machinery (24–26). Also a CBP-
associated protein NcoA-1, a member of the p160/steroid
receptor coactivator family, has been shown to function as
a coactivator for STAT6 (27).
The transcription activation domain (TAD) of STAT6 is
located in the C-terminus of the protein. TADs are the most
divergent domains among different STATs, and are capable

of functioning as independent transactivators (28,29). To
investigate the mechanism of STAT6-mediated transcrip-
tional activation, we have analyzed STAT6-TAD interacting
nuclear proteins, and identified novel, putative components of
the STAT6 enhanceosome. Our previous studies led to the
identification of staphylococcal nuclease (SN)-like domain
containing protein p100 as a STAT6 interacting protein and
an important regulator of IL-4-induced transcription (30).
Here, we report identification of another novel member of
the STAT6 transcriptosome, RNA helicase A (RHA). RHA
possesses several functions in modulation of gene expression.
RHA participates in many aspects of RNA processing and
particularly catalyzes the unwinding of both double-stranded
RNA and DNA (31–33). In addition, RHA functions as a
transcriptional coactivator by bridging RNA Polymerase II
to CBP (26). Our results show that RHA functions as a coac-
tivator in STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation of IL-4-
regulated genes. RHA connects to STAT6 via p100 protein,
and it participates in the assembly of the STAT6-dependent
enhanceosome on the human Ige promoter.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfections
HeLa cells and COS-7 cells were grown as previously
reported (30). Transfection of HeLa cells was performed
using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. COS-7
cells were transfected by electroporation with a Bio-Rad
gene pulser at 260 V/960 mF.

GST-St6-TAD (amino acids 642–847) and Ige-reporter plas-
mids have been described earlier (30,34). pCIneo-N-termHA-
STAT6 was generated by PCR using primers containing the
HA-epitope sequence inserted into the N-terminus of STAT6.
IL-4R-reporter plasmid (IL-4R-STAT6x3-luc) contains three

GST-fusion proteins
GST-fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and
purified with GST affinity beads (glutathione–Sepharose
4B, Pharmacia).
COS-7 cell lysates
Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol and 50 mM sodium fluoride) sup-
plemented with PMSF and aprotinin. Protein concentrations
of the lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
In vitro translation
35S-labeled proteins were prepared by in vitro translation
using TNT T7/T3 Coupled Reticulosyte Lysate System
(Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
GST pulldown assays
Purified GST-fusion proteins were incubated with COS-7 cell
lysates or in vitro translated proteins diluted in NP-40 lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol and 50 mM sodium fluo-
ride). After washes with NP-40 lysis buffer, the bound
proteins were eluted from beads, separated by SDS–PAGE
and analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal
anti-Flag M2 (Sigma) or mouse monoclonal anti-HA (clone
16B 12; BabCO) antibodies, or by autoradiography.
Co-immunoprecipitation
Transfected HeLa or COS-7 cells were resuspended in NP-40
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol and 50 mM sodium
fluoride) supplemented with PMSF and aprotinin. Protein
concentrations of the lysates were measured using the Bio-
Rad Protein Assay system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit
polyclonal anti-STAT6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-
Flag M2 (Sigma), anti-HA antibody (clone 16B 12; BabCO)
or as a control mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody
(Roche). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated
by SDS–PAGE and detected by blotting with anti-Flag M2
antibody (Sigma), anti-STAT6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
or anti-HA antibody (clone 16B 12; BabCO).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
HeLa cells were starved and stimulated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml)
for 4 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments
were carried out as described previously (37) using anti-
STAT6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Flag (Sigma) or
anti-HA (clone 16B 12; BabCO) antibodies. Immunopre-
cipitated DNA was analyzed for human Ige promoter by
quantitative RT–PCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The following primers were used: 50-TGGGCCTGAGAG-
AGAAGAGA-30 and 50-AGCTCTGCCTCAGTGCTTTC-30.
The results were normalized against the total input DNA.

reporter plasmid, 200 ng of pCMV-b-galactosidase plasmid,
200 ng of STAT6-wt plasmid and different expression plas-
mids as indicated in the figures. One day after transfection,
cells were starved overnight in DMEM containing 1% FBS
and treated or left untreated with 10 ng/ml of recombinant
human IL-4 (PeproTech EC Ltd, London, GB). Cells were
lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and

System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The luciferase values were normalized against
b-galactosidase activity of the lysates.
RNAi
siRNAs were generated using the Ambion SilencerTM siRNA
Construction Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Sense and antisense primers corresponding to the following
target sequences were used: RHA I 50-AACCACACAGG-
TTCCCCAGTT-30 (corresponding to nt 1331–1351 of
human RHA mRNA), RHA II 50-AAGGAAAGCAACTGG-
GCTATA-30 (corresponding to nt 2764–2784 of human
RHA mRNA). Primers were extended with the sequence
50-CCTGTCTC-30 at the 30 end. Transfection of cells was
performed as follows: HeLa cells were plated in 24-well
tissue-culture plates at a density of 3–5 · 104 cells per well
and incubated for 24 h before transfection. Cotransfection
of 100 ng of Ige-reporter, 50 ng of b-galactosidase and
60 pmol of siRNA were performed with Oligofectamine
(Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were
either stimulated with 10 ng/ml of IL-4 or left untreated. Cells
were lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI)
48 h after transfection. Luciferase expression was determined
using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI)
and the results were normalized against b-galactosidase
activity of the lysates.
RESULTS
Interaction between RHA and STAT6
To identify possible coregulators of STAT6, the TAD of
STAT6 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)
fusion protein (GST-St6TAD) and used to purify interacting
nuclear proteins from Ramos B cells, as explained by Yang
et al. (30). The band corresponding to a 140 kDa protein
was recovered and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The
molecular masses of the digested peptides were measured
by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The program ProFound
was used to compare the mass maps obtained against theoreti-
cal tryptic peptide mass maps in the OWL protein sequence
database. The comparison resulted in identification of the
140 kDa protein as human RNA helicase A protein.
Initially GST pulldown assay method was used to investi-
gate, whether the detected interaction between STAT6 and
RHA was direct or mediated via bridging factors. The bacte-
rially produced GST-fusion proteins were purified using
glutathione–Sepharose beads. The purity and the quantity of
the fusion proteins were then analyzed with SDS–PAGE and
protein staining. Equal amounts of fusion proteins bound to
glutathione beads were then used for binding assays with
either ectopically expressed or in vitro translated proteins.
Protein complexes were separated by SDS–PAGE. GST-
fusion proteins containing different RHA fragments (GST-
RHA1, 2, 3, 4) (26,36) were used in the interaction assays.
Fragment 1 (amino acids 1–262) consists of the N-terminal
basic region, in which there are two double-stranded RNA
binding domains. Fragments 2 (amino acids 255–664) and
3 (amino acids 649–1077) form the central core of the
enzyme, and contain the helicase motifs. ATP binding
domain is situated in the fragment 2. C-terminal fragment
4 (amino acids 1064–1270) contains an RGG-rich region,
which is capable of binding single-stranded nucleic acids
(38). GST-RHA fusion proteins and as a negative control
GST recombinant proteins were produced in bacteria
and affinity purified. GST and GST-fusion proteins were
incubated with COS-7 cell lysates expressing HA-tagged
STAT6, or with in vitro translated STAT6. After SDS–
PAGE, an analysis of the RHA-bound proteins was
performed. Anti-HA western blotting or autoradiography
failed to detect any interaction between GST-RHA-fusion
proteins and the expressed or in vitro translated STAT6
(Figure 1A–C). Interaction between RHA and STAT6 was
also studied reciprocally: purified GST-STAT6-TAD and
GST recombinant proteins were incubated with lysates
expressing HA-tagged full-length RHA or with in vitro trans-
lated RHA. The results in Figure 1E and F show that RHA
did not interact with GST-STAT6-TAD.
Co-immunoprecipitation method was used to analyze
whether RHA-STAT6 complex can be detected in vivo.
COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-epitope tagged RHA
and STAT6 either separately or together. Immunoprecipita-
tion from total cell lysates was performed using anti-HA
or anti-STAT6 antibodies. After SDS–PAGE and western
blotting, the presence of RHA and STAT6 was detected
using anti-HA and anti-STAT6 antibodies. As shown in
Figure 1H, RHA did not immunoprecipitate with STAT6.
Taken together these results indicate that RHA and STAT6
do not interact directly, and suggest that the initially detected
interaction is mediated by bridging proteins.
Interaction between RHA and p100
Previously we have shown that p100 interacts with STAT6
both in vitro and in vivo and functions as an adapter protein
for RNA pol II and CBP (30,37). Therefore, we wanted to
investigate whether RHA-STAT6 interaction could be
mediated by p100.
We used co-immunoprecipitation method to investigate
whether RHA and p100 form a complex. COS-7 cells were
transfected with HA-epitope tagged RHA and Flag-tagged
p100 either separately or together. RHA was immunoprecipi-
tated from the total cell lysates with anti-HA, or as a negative
control, with anti-Myc antibody, and the presence of p100
was detected after SDS–PAGE and western blotting with
anti-Flag antibody. p100 was found to immunoprecipitate
with RHA (Figure 2A) but p100 was not detected in anti-
HA immunoprecipitations from cells transfected only with
RHA or p100. Stripping and reprobing of the same membrane
with anti-HA shows equal amounts of RHA in different sam-
ples. Neither p100 nor RHA was detected from the control
sample precipitated with anti-Myc or from non-transfected
control sample (COS-7 cell 0-lysate). To study the interac-
tions with endogenous STAT6, HeLa cells were transfected
with RHA, with or without p100-Flag. STAT6 was immuno-
precipitated from total cell lysates with anti-STAT6 antibody,
and the presence of RHA was detected by anti-HA immuno-
blotting. As shown in Figure 2B, RHA did not coimmunopre-
cipitate with STAT6 in cells transfected with only RHA.
However, RHA was detected in the STAT6 immunocomplex

in cells ectopically expressing p100 protein, indicating that
p100 protein could function as a bridging factor between
RHA and STAT6 in vivo.
In order to define, which domains of p100 and RHA
interact, GST pulldown assays were performed. GST-fusion
proteins containing two different p100 fragments, GST-
p100-SN and GST-p100-TD, were used. GST-p100-SN
fusion protein contains the four SN-like domains and GST-
p100-TD the single TD-domain of p100. GST-fusion proteins
were incubated with overexpressed HA-tagged RHA or with
in vitro translated RHA. As shown in Figure 2F and G, RHA
interacted specifically with GST-p100-SN, but not with
GST or GST-p100-TD. Similar experiments were performed
reciprocally: bacterially produced GST-RHA fragments were
incubated with Flag-tagged, overexpressed or in vitro trans-
lated p100. The results show that p100 interacts specifically
with GST-RHA2 (Figure 2C and D).
To confirm the assembly of STAT6-p100-RHA ternary
protein complex, GST pulldown experiments were performed
with GST-RHA2 or GST-RHA1 as a negative control, and
in vitro translated STAT6 and p100. GST-fusion proteins
were first incubated with p100, and after stringent washes
(NP-40 lysis buffer with 300 mM NaCl) with STAT6. The
results in Figure 2I show that both the higher migrating
p100 as well as the lower migrating STAT6 were detected
in GST-RHA2 pulldown but not with GST-RHA1 pulldown.
To conclude, these results indicate that RHA interacts
directly with p100. The interaction is mediated by fragment
2 (amino acids 255–664) of RHA and SN domains of p100.
The results also suggest that p100 protein functions as a
bridging factor between STAT6 and RHA.
In vivo binding of STAT6, p100 and RHA complex to
the Ig« promoter
To confirm that RHA is recruited to STAT6-dependent IL-4-
inducible Ige promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays were performed. Cells were transfected with p100-
Flag, RHA-HA or empty vector, stimulated with IL-4 or
left untreated. Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked chromatin
was performed with anti-STAT6, anti-Flag or anti-HA anti-
bodies. DNA was extracted and analyzed for the STAT6
binding site containing region of human Ige promoter.
As shown in Figure 3, IL-4 stimulation increased the bind-
ing of endogenous STAT6 to the promoter. Ectopic expres-
sion of RHA alone did not affect the STAT6 promoter
binding, but expression of p100 together with RHA enhanced
the promoter binding of STAT6 after IL-4 stimulation. This
result confirms that a ternary complex between RHA, p100
and STAT6 is formed on Ige promoter after IL-4 stimulation,
and suggests, that RHA participates in the assembly of
STAT6 enhanceosome through p100.
The functional role of RHA in STAT6-mediated
transcriptional activation
p100 as well as RHA have been reported to function as tran-
scriptional regulators. p100 functions as a coactivator for
EBNA2, STAT5 and STAT6, but has also been reported to
inhibit c-Myb-dependent promoter activation (39–41). RHA
cooperates with CBP and acts as a positive regulator in the
transcriptional activation via the cAMP responsive factor
CREB. The helicase activity of RHA, which is dependent

on the ATP binding activity, is required for mediating the
target gene activation (26).
The functional role of RHA in STAT6-mediated trans-
criptional activation was investigated with the luciferase
reporter gene assay. HeLa cells were cotransfected with
STAT6-dependent Ige- or IL-4R-promoter containing
luciferase reporter genes together with increasing amounts
of RHA or mutant form of RHA, which is defective in
ATP-binding and helicase activity (Figure 4A and B). IL-4
stimulation resulted in Ige- or IL-4R-reporter stimulation.
The basal activity of the reporter was not affected, but
RHA expression enhanced the IL-4-stimulated reporter gene
activity in a dose dependent manner. The ATP-binding mut-
ant of RHA inhibited IL-4-induced Ige- and IL-4R-reporter
gene expression. The mutant form of RHA was not defective
in binding to p100, suggesting that the interaction is not
dependent on the helicase/ATP-binding activity of RHA
(data not shown).
We also performed knockdown experiments using two dif-
ferent siRNAs directed against RHA in Ige-reporter gene
assays (Figure 5). IL-4 induced strong transcriptional activa-
tion in the control cells that were not treated with siRNA or
treated with siRNA directed against scrambled sequence. As
expected, depletion of STAT6 by siRNA completely abro-
gated Ige reporter activation. Also both siRNAs directed
against RHA caused a marked inhibition of Ige reporter
activation. In control experiments the RHA siRNAs reduced
the amount of RHA protein by ~60%. Taken together, these
results suggest that RHA is a coactivator in STAT6-mediated
transcription, and this function is dependent on its helicase
activity.

coregulators. These proteins both modify chromatin struc-
tures and recruit the basal transcription machinery to the
DNA. STAT6 is a signal transducer and transcription activa-
tor that is activated by IL-4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation
and mediates most of the IL-4- and IL-13-induced gene
responses (6). The mechanisms by which STAT6 activates
gene transcription are still largely unknown. Identification
of the transcriptional coregulators of STAT6 and the com-
position of STAT6 transcriptosome is an important step in
solving the events leading to transcriptional activation of
IL-4-regulated genes including the allergy mediator Ige.
In this study we identified RHA as a novel component of
STAT6 enhanceosome. RHA is considered to participate in
regulation of transcription by several mechanisms, which
involve both bridging functions and helicase functions.
RHA is detected in RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) holo-
enzyme complexes and it interacts directly with RNA pol II
(26). RHA has also been reported to interact with several
other nuclear proteins necessary for transcriptional activation,
including CBP/p300, topoisomerase IIa, breast cancer
specific tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 and survival of
motor neurons (SMN) complex (26,42–44). RHA is able to
bind both DNA and RNA, but it has been suggested to be
mainly pre-RNA and mRNA-binding protein. RHA has stron-
ger affinity towards single-stranded than double-stranded
DNA substrates, suggesting that RHA might have a transient
role in DNA-binding during transcript formation (45). The
centrally located catalytic core domain of RHA contains
a DExH motif and a group of seven helicase motifs. The
unwinding activity driven by ATP is localized to the core
domain, where the ATP binding site is situated (38). It is
expected, that RHA induces local changes in chromatin
structure of promoter DNA, promoting the entry of the tran-
scriptional apparatus (26).
The interaction between RHA and STAT6 was mediated
by p100 protein. p100 (SND1, Tudor-SN) was initially iden-
tified as a transcriptional coactivator for Epstein–Barr virus
nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) (39), and subsequently been
shown to interact with other transcription factors such as
TFIIE, c-Myb, STAT5 and STAT6 (30,39–41). p100 consists
of four SN-like domains and a single TD-domain. SN-like
domains of p100 resemble staphylococcal nucleases, small
calcium-dependent enzymes that hydrolyze both DNA and
RNA (46). However, SN-like domains of p100 lack catalytic
activity, but instead are implicated to function as interaction
domains. The first subdomain in the SN-like domains forms
an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold struc-
ture. However, it is still not clear, whether p100 can directly
bind to DNA. Instead, SN-like domains have been shown to
function as protein interaction domains: p100 has been
reported to interact with c-Myb and Pim-1 serine/threonine
kinase through sequences located in SN-like domains
(41,47). p100 also interacts both with STAT6-TAD, STAT5-
TAD, RNA Pol II and CBP through the SN-like domains
(30,37,40). Here, we show that the SN-like domains
of p100 also mediate the interaction between STAT6 and
Figure 3. In vivo binding of STAT6, p100 and RHA complex to the Ige
promoter HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p100, RHA or
empty vector as indicated in the figure. Cells were treated with IL-4 for 4 h or
left untreated. Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked chromatin was performed
with anti-STAT6, anti-Flag or anti-HA. DNA was extracted and analyzed
for the region of human Ige promoter that contains a STAT6 binding site by
quantitative RT–PCR. The results were normalized against the total input
DNA.
Figure 4. RHA enhances STAT6-dependent transcriptional activation HeLa cells were transfected with either Ige- (A) or IL-4R-luciferase reporter (B),
b-galactosidase, STAT6 and increasing amounts of either RHA or ATP-binding mutant RHA (mRHA). Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were starved
and either stimulated with IL-4 or left untreated. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection and luciferase expression was determined. The results were normalized
against b-galactosidase activity of the lysates.

RHA. Thus, the SN-like domains appear to have evolved as
important docking elements in the assembly of transcription
complexes, and multiplication of the SN-like domains has
provided possibilities for several simultaneous protein–
protein interactions. The TD-domain of p100 is a hybrid
SN-like domain, in which the OB-domain has been replaced
by a domain found in Drosophila melanogaster Tudor
protein (46). The tudor domain of p100 has been suggested
to function in RNA or protein binding and RNA metabolism
and/or transport (48). Our recent results support this notion
and indicate that the TD domains are important for pre-
RNA processing (Yang et al., unpublished).
The interaction between p100 and RHA is mediated by
RHA fragment 2 (amino acids 255–664), which is located
in the central catalytic core of the enzyme. This fragment
contains several helicase motifs and the ATP binding domain;
a K/R 417 substitution in this domain abrogates the helicase
activity. The same region has previously been reported to
interact with the 200 kDa subunit of RNA pol II (26) and
BRCA1 (43), while the interaction between RHA and CBP
is mediated by the N-terminal region (amino acid 1–250) of
RHA. Both CBP and BRCA1 activate transcription when
they are linked to the RNA pol II holoenzyme via RHA.
BRCA1 is suggested to function as a transcriptional coactiva-
tor by interacting with specific DNA binding transcription
factors to transmit a regulatory signal to the RNA pol II
holoenzyme via RHA. BRCA1 mutants, which have a
reduced ability to bind to RHA, are observed in breast cancer.
It has been suggested, that weaker interaction between RHA
and BRCA1 decreases the transcriptional activity of BRCA1,
leading to the development of breast cancer (43).
RHA was also found to function as coactivator for two
different IL-4-regulated gene promoters, Ige and IL-4R.
Mutation of the ATP binding lysine in RHA did not affect
the interaction with p100, but abolished the coactivator
function. Thus, the helicase activity of RHA appears to be
required for the transcriptional effect. Previously, RHA has
been shown to enhance the transactivation of NF-kB p65 in
helicase activity-dependent manner (49). Our results are
consistent with a model where RHA functions in STAT6
transcriptosome as a chromatin remodelling factor. RHA
interacts also with other chromatin modifying proteins
including CBP (26) and topoisomeraseIIa (42), and recruit-
ment of these proteins to the promoter may facilitate
the entry of transcription activation complexes to the
initiation site.
RHA is involved in transcription activation complexes
composed of several different transcription factors and
coregulators, and may therefore be an essential coregulator
for a variety of transcriptional pathways. The specificity
may be determined by the interacting proteins and the com-
position of the transcription activation complex. This study
provides a new insight into the mechanisms of STAT6-
mediated transcriptional activation. Our results suggest that
RHA acts as a coactivator for STAT6 in IL-4 induced
STAT6-mediated transcription. In addition to its function as
a bridging factor, the ATPase/helicase activity of RHA is
also important for transactivation. Interestingly, chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the formation of
ternary complex between p100, RHA and STAT6 resulted
in enhanced promoter binding of STAT6, thus suggesting
that the ternary protein complex may facilitate the unwinding
of the chromatin structure and accessibility of the promoter.
The role of p100 on RHA promoter recruitment was further
investigated by RNAi experiments. Knockdown of p100
reduced but did not abolish the promoter binding of RHA
(data not shown) suggesting that also other coactivator
proteins such as CBP are likely to function in the recruit-
ment of the promoter complex. In pulldown and co-
immunoprecipitation assays RHA was found to interact
directly with p100 protein. Both RHA and p100 have been
implicated in regulation of gene expression through several
mechanisms such as coupling transcription with RNA pro-
cessing or DNA replication (39). Therefore, it is possible
that this interaction may also serve other, yet unknown func-
tions in these processes.
