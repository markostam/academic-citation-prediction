[1] We study, by using a wavelet decomposition
methodology, the solar signature on global surface
temperature data using the ACRIM total solar irradiance
satellite composite by Willson and Mordvinov. These data
present a +0.047%/decade trend between minima during
solar cycles 21–23 (1980–2002). We estimate that the
ACRIM upward trend might have minimally contributed
10–30% of the global surface temperature warming over

1. Introduction
[2] Among the potential contributors to climate change,
solar forcing is by far the most controversial. The Sun can
influence climate through mechanisms that are not fully
understood but which can be linked to solar variations of
luminosity, magnetic field, UV radiation, solar flares and
modulation of the cosmic ray intensity [Pap and Fox, 2004;
Lean, 2005]. In addition, there is also controversy about
solar data. Figure 1 shows two similar but not identical
satellite composites of total solar irradiance (TSI) that cover
solar cycles 21–23 (1980–2002): the PMOD due to Fro¨hlich
and Lean [1998] and the ACRIM due to Willson and
Mordvinov [2003], respectively.
[3] PMOD has been widely used in geophysical research.
According to this composite, TSI has been almost stationary
(0.009%/decade trend of the 21–23 solar minima [Willson
and Mordvinov, 2003]) and by adopting it, or the equivalent
TSI proxy reconstruction by Lean et al. [1995], some
researchers and the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), 2001; Hansen et al., 2002] de-
duced that the Sun has not contributed to the observed
global surface warming of the past decades. Consequently,
the global surface warming of DT1980–2002 = 0.40 ± 0.04K
from 1980 to 2002 shown in Figure 2 could only be
induced, directly or indirectly, by anthropogenic added
green house gas (GHG) climate forcing.
[4] Contrariwise, ACRIM presents a significant upward
trend (+0.047%/decade trend of the minima) during solar
cycles 21–23 (1980–2002) [Willson and Mordvinov, 2003].
The purpose of this letter is to estimate the contribution of
this upward trend to the global surface warming from 1980
to 2002, which covers one Hale solar cycle.
2. Climate Models and Data Analysis
[5] The ACRIM upward trend is evaluated by calculating
the difference between the TSI average during solar cycle
21–22 (1980–1991) (1365.95 ± 0.08 W/m2) and the TSI
average during solar cycle 22–23 (1991–2002) (1366.40 ±
0.03 W/m2). We find this difference to be
DIsun ¼ 0:45 0:10 W=m2: ð1Þ
The errors bars are calculated using multiple TSI averages
by considering that the period of a solar cycle spans
between 10 and 12 years and by keeping fixed the
extremum at 1991. Note also that the upward ACRIM
modulation during solar cycles 21–23 can be minimally
interpreted as a 22-year square waveform modulation,
which recalls a Hale solar cycle, with amplitude DIsun.
[6] There exist at least two ways to estimate the Sun’s
influence on climate. The first method relies on climate
models, such as energy balance models [Wigley, 1988;
Stevens and North, 1996; Foukal et al., 2004] or general
circulation models [IPCC, 2001; Hansen et al. 2002]. The
climate model approach is problematic because the sun-
climate coupling mechanisms are not fully understood and,
therefore, cannot be confidently included in the computa-
tional models [Hoyt and Schatten, 1997; Hansen et al.,
2002; Pap and Fox, 2004].
[7] A second approach, adopted, for example, byDouglass
and Clader [2002], attempts to estimate the climate sensitiv-
ity to solar variation by directly studying the signature of the
solar cycles within the temperature data. This is a phenom-
enological approach but it has the advantage of evaluating the
total effect of the Sun-Climate coupling without requiring a
detailed knowledge of the underlying physical and chemical
mechanisms. Herein we adopt this philosophy using a meth-
odology that differs from the linear regression analysis
implemented by Douglass and Clader [2002], for reasons
explained later.
[8] The climate sensitivity l to a generic radiative forcing
DF is defined as DT = lDF, where DT is the average
temperature change induced by DF. The radiative forcing
associated with a change of TSI, DI, is traditionally obtained
by averaging DI over the entire surface of the Earth and
allowing for a fraction (albedo a  0.3) of DI to be reflected

DI. However, the above definition is not
optimal if, as is commonly believed, the Sun affects climate
by means of direct or indirect mechanisms over and above
that of the direct TSI forcing. Because solar phenomena
present cycles and general patterns that mimic TSI patterns,
we hypothesize that, to a first-order approximation, TSI can
be used as a geometrical proxy for the overall solar activity
and its effects on climate. Moreover, there might be a
dependence of this response on frequency [Wigley, 1988].
Thus, we introduce the following model for the total climate
sensitivity to the total solar activity:
DTsun ¼
Z 1
0
Z wð Þ dDI
dw
dw: ð2Þ
The frequency-dependent function Z(w) is herein defined as
the total climate sensitivity to solar variations. Note that
Douglass and Clader [2002] adopted a model in which the
function Z(w) is a constant k at all frequencies such that:
DTsun = kDI.
[9] Douglass and Clader [2002] evaluated the climate
sensitivity to solar variation, k = 0.11 ± 0.02K/(Wm2), by
using the PMOD TSI composite and by means of a multiple
linear regression analysis based on a predictor for the
temperature T(t) of the form C(t) = f(t) + k1I(t  t1) +
k2S(t  t2) + k3V(t  t3), where t is the time, f(t) is a linear
function, I(t  t1) is the solar irradiance, S(t  t2) is a
measure of the El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
indexed by the SST anomalies, V(t  t3) is a measure of
the volcano-aerosol signal, ti are fixed lag-times that give
the highest correlation between each signal and the data,
and the ki are the corresponding forcing constants. However,
the multiple linear regression analysis is not optimal be-
cause the parameters ki and ti might be time-dependent and,
in such a case, keeping them constant would yield serious
systematic errors in the evaluation of the parameters ki.
Moreover, climate models predict that the climate sensitiv-
ity to cyclical forcing increases at lower frequencies because
of the strong frequency-dependent damping effect of ocean
thermal inertia [Wigley, 1988; Foukal et al., 2004]. Thus,
Douglass and Clader [2002] evaluated the climate sensi-
tivity to the 11-year solar cycle, but as we have discussed
above, the upward ACRIM modulation during solar cycles
21–23 can be minimally interpreted as a 22-year cycle
modulation with amplitude given by equation (1). There-
fore, we have to evaluate the climate sensitivity to a 22-year
cycle and then we can approximate equation (2) as
DTsun 5 Z22yearsDIsun: ð3Þ
[10] We proceed by decomposing the solar and temper-
ature signals with proper band-pass filters for isolating the
frequency bands of interest. The purpose is to estimate a
linear transfer coefficient Z(w) = Aout(w)/Ain(w) by compar-
ing the amplitude Ain(w) of an oscillating input signal at a
given frequency w, with the amplitude Aout(w) of the
oscillating output signal at the same frequency and then to
apply equation (3). Linear transfer analysis is the usual
method adopted to estimate the sensitivity of a complex but
unknown system to external stimulation.
[11] The band pass filter we adopt is based on the
maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT)
multiresolution analysis (MRA) by means of the 8-tap
Daubechies least asymmetric (LA8) filter [Percival and
Walden, 2000]. MRA makes use of scaled waveforms that
measure signal variations by simultaneously analyzing the
signal’s time and scaling properties and, therefore, can
powerfully identify local non-periodic patterns and signal
singularities, and characterize signal structures [Percival
and Walden, 2000]. Thus, the wavelet filtering is more
efficient than the traditional linear transport frequency filters
for extracting patterns from the data.
[12] MODWT MRA decomposes a time series X(t) into a
hierarchical sequence of zero-centered band-pass filter
curves called detail curves Dj(t), and a hierarchical sequence
of smooth low-pass filter curves, called Sj(t). High-pass
filter curves are referred to as residual curves and indicated
with Rj(t). The index j indicates the order of scaling. So, at
the Jth order MODWT MRA decomposes a signal X(t) as
X(t) = SJ(t) +
PJ
j¼1Dj(t) = SJ(t) + RJ(t). The smooth curve
SJ(t) captures the smooth modulation of the data with a time
scale larger than 2J+1 units of the time interval Dt at which
the data are sampled. The detail curve Dj(t) captures local
variations with period approximately ranging from 2jDt to
2j+1Dt. Finally, the residual curve RJ(t) = X(t)  SJ(t) =

j¼1Dj(t) captures local variations of the data at time scales
shorter than 2J+1Dt.
[13] The global surface temperature data are sampled
monthly. The 11-year cycle (132 months) would be cap-
tured by the wavelet detail D7(t) that corresponds to the
band between 27 = 128 and 28 = 256 months. However, the
solar cycles are pseudo-periodic and to avoid an excessive
random split of the cycles between adjacent wavelet detail
curves, the wavelet filter should be optimized by choosing a
time interval Dt such that the 11-year periodicity falls in the
middle of the band captured by the curve D7(t). The average
between 128 and 256 is 192, and the correct time interval is
Dt = 132/192 = 0.6875 months. By using a linear interpo-
lation we transform the monthly temperature data into a new
time series sampled at Dt = 0.6875 months, and then apply
the MRA to it. Thus, the detail curve D7(t) captures the
scaling band between 88–176 months (or 7.3–14.7 years)
centered in the 11-year solar cycle, while the detail curve
D8(t) captures the band between 176–352 months (or 14.7–
29.3 years) centered in the 22-year solar cycle. Figure 3
shows the MODWT MRA of the global mean surface
temperature since 1856 defined by the decomposition
T tð Þ ¼ S8 tð Þ þ D8 tð Þ þ D7 tð Þ þ R6 tð Þ: ð4Þ
The smooth curve S8(t) captures the secular variation of the
temperature at time scale larger than 29.3 years that is
reasonably produced by the slow modulation of the GHG
and aerosol forcings plus the slow secular variation of the
solar forcing. The detail curves D8(t) and D7(t) correspond,
according to our hypothesis, to the climate signature
imprinted by the 22-year and 11-year solar cycles
respectively. The residual curve R6(t) collects all climate
fluctuations at a time scale shorter than 7.3 years, which is
mostly affected by SST oscillations, volcano eruptions and
undetermined noise.
[14] Figure 4 compares the band-pass curves D7(t) and
D8(t) for the TSI data and global temperature anomalies.
For the period 1856–1980 we apply the MRA to the TSI
proxy reconstruction by Lean et al. [1995], while for the
period 1980–2002 the MRA is applied to the ACRIM
TSI. Several 11-year solar cycles are easily recognizable in
the corresponding D7(t) temperature cycles, in particular
after 1960. The slow 22-year solar cycles are clearly
recognizable in the temperature detail curve D8(t) and
the temperature response lags the Hale solar cycles since
1900 by approximately 2.2 ± 2 years.
[15] We evaluate the linear transfer coefficient Z7 and Z8
by estimating the amplitude of the solar and temperature
oscillations associated with the band-pass curves D7(t) and
D8(t) during the period 1980–2002. The amplitude A of an

3. Discussion and Conclusion
[17] Our methodology filtered off volcano-aerosol and
ENSO-SST signals from the temperature data because these

2005, http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk) and its MODWT MRA
according to equation (4). The residual curve R6(t) becomes
progressively less noisy probably because of improved
observations during the last 150 years.

pass curves applied to the ACRIM TSI (1980–2002).

estimates are partially consistent with already published
independent empirical findings. In fact, the 11-year climate
sensitivity Z7 = 0.11 ± 0.02K/(Wm
2) is equal to the 11-year
climate sensitivity k estimated by Douglass and Clader
[2002]. Douglass and Clader also estimated that the 11-year
solar cycle is associated with a 0.10K temperature cycle and
this value is equal to our estimate A7,temp, see also Lean
[2005]. Because Douglass and Clader used a multiple linear
regression analysis to separate the 11-year solar signature
from the volcano-aerosol and ENSO-SST signals we can
conclude that our wavelet band-pass filter has efficiently
filtered off from the temperature data both volcano-aerosol
and ENSO-SST signals. Evidently, from 1980 to 2002
volcano-aerosol and ENSO-SST signals affected climate
on time scales shorter than 7.3 years which are captured
by the residual curve R6(t).
[18] Our climate sensitivities Z7 and Z8 were also ap-
proximately anticipated by White et al. [1997]. These
authors, by adopting Fourier band-pass filters centered at
11 and 22 year periodicities respectively, studied the re-
sponse of global upper ocean temperature to changing solar
irradiance using the TSI proxy reconstruction by Lean et al.
[1995] from 1900 to 1991. Their regression coefficients
between solar and temperature cycles are k11-years = 0.10 ±
0.02K/(Wm2) and k22-years = 0.14 ± 0.02K/(Wm
2). These
estimates are slightly smaller than Z7 and Z8, respectively,
probably because these authors analyzed a different tempo-
ral period, and adopted a hypothetical TSI sequence and
ocean surface temperature while we used global surface
temperature, and over land the climate response to solar
variation is stronger than over ocean.
[19] The climate sensitivity to the 22-year cycle, Z8, is
approximately 1.5 times stronger than the climate sensitivity
to the 11-year cycle, Z7, and, on average, the 22-year
climate response lags Hale solar cycles by approximately
2.2 ± 2 years. These effects are predicted by theoretical
energy balance models. In fact, the actual climate re-
sponse to cyclical forcing is stronger at lower frequencies
because the damping effect of the ocean inertia is weaker
at lower frequencies [Wigley, 1988, Table 1]. This fre-
quency dependence arises because the system is typically
not in thermodynamic equilibrium. The ratio Z8/Z7 = 1.55 ±
0.55 is consistent with that between the damping factors for
20 and 10 year periodicities h20/h10  1.45 indicated by
Wigley [1988, Table 1]. Wigley’s model also predicts a
response-lag of 2.5–2.8 years for a 20 year periodicity.
[20] In conclusion, we believe our estimates Z7 and Z8 of
the climate sensitivity to solar variations from 1980 to 2002
are realistic. By using the ACRIM TSI increase estimate
DIsun (1) and the climate sensitivity Z8 (6) in equation (3),
the warming caused by DIsun is DTsun5 0.08 ± 0.03. Thus,
because the global surface warming during the period
1980–2002 was DT1980–2002 = 0.40 ± 0.04K, we conclude
that according to the ACRIM TSI composite the Sun may
have minimally contributed 10–30% of the 1980–2002
global surface warming.
[21] Lastly, we compare the observed 11-year tempera-
ture cycle amplitude, A7,temp = 0.10 ± 0.01K, with that
estimated by some theoretical climate models. By adopting
three energy balance models, Stevens and North [1996,
Figure 15] show 11-year TSI cycle forcing since 1980
would imprint 11-year global surface temperature cycles
with an amplitude Atemp  0.06 ± 0.01K; the MAGICC
climate model by Wigley gives Atemp  0.035K [Foukal et
al., 2004]. Consequently, our estimate of the 11-year tem-
perature cycle A7,temp is approximately 1.5–3 times larger
than what these models predict. Douglass and Clader
[2002] arrived at a similar conclusion about the Wigley
model. Thus, while the theoretical models approximately
predict the relative climate sensitivity ratio Z8/Z7 and the
response time-lag, they seem to disagree from each other
about the actual climate sensitivity to solar variation and
significantly underestimate the phenomenological climate
sensitivities to solar cycles as we have estimated. Evidently,
either the empirical evidence deriving from the deconstruc-
tion of the surface temperature is deceptive, or the models
are inadequate because of the difficulty of modeling climate
in general and a lack of knowledge of climate sensitivity to
solar variations in particular. As Lean [2005] noted, the
models might be inadequate: (1) in their parameterizations
of climate feedbacks and atmosphere-ocean coupling; (2) in
their neglect of indirect response by the stratosphere and of
possible additional climate effects linked to solar magnetic
field, UV radiation, solar flares and cosmic ray intensity
modulations; (3) there might be other possible natural
amplification mechanisms deriving from internal modes of
climate variability which are not included in the models. All
the above mechanisms would be automatically considered
and indirectly included in our phenomenological approach.
