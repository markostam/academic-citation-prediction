ABSTRACT
The Pathway Tools cellular overview diagram is
a visual representation of the biochemical network
of an organism. The overview is automatically
created from a Pathway/Genome Database descri-
bing that organism. The cellular overview includes
metabolic, transport and signaling pathways, and
other membrane and periplasmic proteins. Pathway
Tools supports interrogation and exploration of
cellular biochemical networks through the overview
diagram. Furthermore, a software component called
the Omics Viewer provides visual analysis of whole-
organism datasets using the overview diagram as
an organizing framework. For example, gene expres-
sion and metabolomics measurements, alone or in
combination, can be painted onto the overview, as
can computed whole-organism datasets, such as
predicted reaction-flux values. The cellular overview
and Omics Viewer provide a mechanism whereby
biologists can apply the pattern-recognition capabi-
lities of the human visual system to analyze large-
scale datasets in a biologically meaningful context.
SRI’s BioCyc.org website provides overview diag-
rams for more than 200 organisms. This article
describes enhancements to the overview made
since a 1999 publication, including the automatic
layout capability, expansion of the cellular machi-
nery that it includes, new semantic zooming and
poster-generating capabilities, and extension of the
Omics Viewer to support painting of metabolites,
animations and zooming to individual pathway
diagrams.
INTRODUCTION
Whole-organism analyses, whether computational or experi-
mental, require whole-organism visualization tools. The
human visual system has powerful pattern-recognition capa-
bilities, but to harness that power, visual information must
be presented within a meaningful organization. Our Pathway
Tools software (1) produces a pathway-based visualization of
cellular biochemical networks, called the cellular overview
diagram. The software supports interrogation and exploration
of the network. A component called the Omics Viewer
provides visual analysis of whole-organism measurements
using the biochemical network as an organizing framework.
For example, gene expression and metabolomics measure-
ments, alone or in combination, can be painted onto the cel-
lular overview diagram, as could computed whole-organism
datasets, such as predicted reaction-flux values, or predicted
essential genes.
Pathway Tools can automatically generate a cellular
overview diagram for an organism from a Pathway/Genome
Database (PGDB) describing the genome and biochemical
networks of the organism. A PGDB can in turn be automa-
tically generated from the annotated genome sequence of
an organism. Thus, at the push of a few buttons, a scientist
can generate from an annotated genome sequence a powerful
device for interpreting system-biology studies of that organi-
sm. And as a PGDB is updated to reflect evolving scientific
knowledge of the organism, its overview can be automa-
tically updated to reflect those updates. SRI’s BioCyc.org
website provides overview diagrams for more than 200
organisms (2).
The cellular overview includes metabolic, transport and
signaling pathways, and other membrane and periplasmic
proteins, and can be displayed at user-selected magnification.
The Omics Viewer can produce animated visualizations of
whole-organism datasets, and it allows the user to inspect
individual pathways at high resolution.
The overview and Omics Viewer have been under develop-
ment since 1997 (3)—our group was the first to create a
cellular pathway diagram that could be used to interpret
omics data. This article reports on a number of recent enhan-
cements to the software since 1999 (3) including automated
layout capabilities, addition of periplasmic and membrane
reactions and proteins, new zooming and web navigation cap-
abilities, a novel poster-generating facility, and an extension
of the Omics Viewer to support visualization of metabolite
profiling data, customizable color schemes, animations for
time course data and the superposition of high-throughput
data onto individual pathway diagrams.

ORGANIZATION OF THE CELLULAR OVERVIEW
DIAGRAM
The cellular overview diagram is a graph that depicts many
aspects of the cellular biochemical network, including
metabolic and transport reactions and pathways, bacterial
signaling pathways, and periplasmic and membrane proteins.
A sample cellular overview diagram is shown in Figure 1.
Visual elements of the diagram encode the following aspects
of the biochemical network.
Nodes in the overview represent biochemical species
including small-molecule metabolites and, in some cases,
proteins. The shape of a node indicates the type of chemical
compound (e.g. triangles depict amino acids, squares depict
carbohydrates and diamonds depict proteins). Nodes are filled
to indicate phosphorylation of the molecule.
Lines between nodes represent the biochemical or transport
reactions that occur in the cell. Transport reactions are
shown as lines that span a membrane. Directionality of trans-
port is indicated by arrowheads. Most pathways flow in the
downward direction in the diagram (although reaction
directionality is not shown explicitly, display of reversibility
information where available will be supported in an
upcoming version of the software).
The cellular overview diagram does not show all possible
connections between pairs of metabolites in an organism. To
do so would result in a diagram that was largely unreadable.
Rather, the overview diagram shows all pathways defined in
an organism’s PGDB. When multiple pathways have been
combined within a single superpathway, the superpathway
is shown rather than the individual pathways. To the extent
that individual metabolites and reactions appear in more
than one pathway, they will be duplicated in the overview
diagram.
Pathways with related biological functions are grouped
together in the diagram, with shaded background boxes deli-
neating these groupings. The MetaCyc pathway ontology
defines these groupings; examples for ontology classes
include pathways of cofactor biosynthesis and pathways of
carbohydrate utilization. The overall organization of the dia-
gram positions biosynthetic pathways on the left, degradation
pathways on the right and energy metabolism pathways in the
middle. Any metabolic reactions in the PGDB that are not
members of pathways appear to the right of the degradation
pathways, laid out in tabular fashion. For PGDBs such as
EcoCyc that contain signal transduction pathways (these are
not inferred computationally, but can be created by curators),
these pathways appear at the bottom.
Surrounding these pathways, we draw a border repre-
senting the cell membrane. For Gram-negative bacteria,
we draw an inner and outer membrane with a periplasmic
space in between, whereas for other organisms we draw
only a single membrane. This representation is suitable for
most bacteria—the cell architecture of more complex organ-
isms is not currently represented in the cellular overview.
Transport reactions are shown crossing the appropriate mem-
brane(s), and any reactions that take place in the periplasmic

or extracellular space are drawn there. In addition, any pro-
teins that are not enzymes but whose location has been
assigned to a membrane or extra-cytoplasmic space will be
drawn in the correct location (the overview does not expli-
citly draw cytoplasmic proteins, as there are too many of
these to make their display useful).
The cellular overview diagram is generated entirely auto-
matically from the data in a PGDB. Automated generation
is a major advantage over previous versions of the Pathway
Tools software (in which overview generation was partially
automated but required significant manual oversight) and
over other software systems, as it frees the curator from mun-
dane and time-consuming layout tasks. It also means that as
data are curated—pathways and reactions added or deleted,
protein cellular locations updated, and so on—the curator
does not need to worry about how this might affect the layout.
With one simple command, the overview can be regenerated
to include all the latest data updates. Automated layout is
further essential for generating organism-specific overviews
for each member of the BioCyc collection of more than
200 PGDBs; that large number of DBs precludes manual
creation of separate overviews for each.
QUERYING THE OVERVIEW
The Overview provides querying capabilities to allow the user
to explore the cellular networks encoded by this diagram.
(The Pathway Tools software can run in either of two con-
figurations: as a standalone desktop application, or as a web
server. Although the cellular overview diagram is available
to users under both configurations, their query capabilities
differ somewhat, with more operations available to users of
the desktop application.)
Mousing over part of the diagram generates a description of
which pathway, compound and so on the mouse pointer is
over. Clicking on an object produces a menu of links to
pages showing details of the selected pathway, reaction or
metabolite. In addition, the magnification of the entire dia-
gram can be altered. Clicking on a pathway pops up a magni-
fied view of the pathway, showing all the individual
metabolite and gene names. This magnified view, which is a
new feature of the software, allows users to quickly orient
themselves and focus in on pathways of interest. It also greatly
enhances the utility of the Omics Viewer, as described below.
The overview diagram is a particularly valuable tool for
understanding and interrogating cellular networks. One of
the requirements for effective pathway visualization systems
identified by Saraiya et al. is to be able to show multiple path-
ways simultaneously, with interconnections between them
(4). (We note that the evaluation performed by Saraiya and
colleagues contains many errors of omission in failing to
note where Pathway Tools (they use the term EcoCyc) satis-
fies many requirements listed in Tables 2–4 in their study.) In
our cellular overview diagram, users can click on any meta-
bolite and ask to see connections drawn between that node
and every other place where that metabolite appears. They
can do this for more than one metabolite, or for all the meta-
bolites in a specified pathway. Thus, the user can quickly
focus in on all connections of interest, while avoiding the
visual clutter that would result if the overview always showed
all possible pathway interconnections. In addition, users can
query and selectively highlight different elements of the over-
view in different colors. Users can search for a particular
metabolite, gene, protein, reaction or pathway and highlight
all the places where that object appears (we highlight reaction
lines as a surrogate for the enzymes and genes that catalyze
them).
Aside from metabolite connections, many other types of
relationships can be explored. Users can search for and
highlight, for example, all proteins with a particular cellular
location, all reactions whose enzymes are activated or inhi-
bited by a particular compound, all genes whose expression
is regulated by a particular transcription factor, all reactions
with multiple isozymes or any one of a number of other pre-
defined queries. They can also highlight a list of genes, reac-
tions and so on imported from a user-supplied file. A new
zooming capability allows the diagram to be shown at
different levels of magnification, which can make highlights
easier to see. Figure 2 shows a section of a zoomed overview
diagram, including selected metabolite connections and
highlights.
The cellular overview diagram can also be used for com-
parative analyses of the complete metabolic networks of
two or more organisms. Given the display of an overview
for one organism, the software can highlight all reactions
that are either shared with, or not shared with, other combina-
tions of organisms for which PGDBs are available. For exam-
ple, given the Bacillus subtilis overview, a user interested in
antimicrobial drug discovery in Gram-positive bacteria might
request a highlighting of reactions shared between B.subtilis,
Bacillus anthracis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The user
could request highlighting of reactions present in all these
organisms, or reactions present in B.subtilis and at least one
of the other organisms selected, or choose to look at only
those reactions present in all these organisms. This compari-
son is not performed at the sequence level, since the question
of whether the organisms share common enzymatic activities
is orthogonal to whether the enzymes that catalyze those
activities share sequence similarity. Rather, two organisms
are considered to share a reaction if the PGDBs for the organ-
isms both specify that some enzyme catalyzes that reaction.
A new feature of the Cellular Overview, which will be
available in our summer 2006 release for the desktop soft-
ware only, is a semantic zooming capability. As the user
zooms in on a region of the overview diagram, first reaction
arrowheads become visible, then pathway labels and meta-
bolite names, and finally, at the highest semantic zoom
level, enzyme names, and gene names become visible.
A new command provides the capability to print out the
overview diagram at its maximum zoom level as a poster-
sized metabolic chart (formatted as a postscript file). The
ability for the owner of a PGDB to automatically generate
a high quality wall chart of their organism’s metabolism at
the push of a button is unique to Pathway Tools. Previous
metabolic charts, such as the Boehringer-Mannheim chart
(5), are mosaics of pathway information from many organi-
sms, and do not precisely describe the metabolism of any
one organism. In contrast, metabolic charts of Pathway
Tools are organism specific, and may be generated from
any of the 200 PGDBs in the BioCyc collection, or from
PGDBs created by other groups. Examples of metabolic

tuberculosis are included with this paper as Supplementary
Data.
THE OMICS VIEWER
One of the most exciting uses of the cellular overview dia-
gram is as a vehicle for pathway-based visualization of
high-throughput experimental data. The Omics Viewer is so
named because it supports overview-based visualizations—
both static and animated—of data from a variety of different
kinds of ‘-omics’ experiments, such as gene expression data,
metabolomics data, proteomics data or any other kind of
experimental data in which numerical data values are
assigned to many individual genes, proteins, reactions or
metabolites. Being able to relate pathway networks to quan-
titative high-throughput data is another key requirement iden-
tified by Saraiya et al. for pathway visualization systems (4).
So that experimental data can be visualized using the
Omics Viewer, each value in a user-supplied dataset is
assigned a color. For example, in a very simple color scheme,
a log ratio >2 might be assigned red, values between 2 and
2 might be assigned black, and values less than 2 might
be assigned green. In the web version, a few predefined
color schemes are available, including a default scheme
computed automatically based on the range of the provided
data. On the desktop version, the color scheme is fully custo-
mizable. Each node or line in the cellular overview diagram
is then drawn in the color corresponding to the value for the
particular gene, protein, reaction or metabolite. The result is a
color-coded metabolic chart that enables the user to instantly
see which pathways or key metabolic or transport steps are
turned on or off under particular sets of conditions. An exam-
ple display can be seen at http://biocyc.org/expr-examples/
single-expt.html.
Many experiments, such as time-series experiments,
involve a series of data points per gene, metabolite, and so
on. In these situations, the Omics Viewer offers the ability
to view the output as an animation, with one frame per
time point. The resulting animation can be viewed all
together as a movie, or can be stopped and advanced, one
time point at a time. An example animation display is avail-
able at http://biocyc.org/expr-examples/animation.html.
The Omics Viewer takes as input a simple tab-delimited
file containing the omics dataset. The first column contains
the name or ID of a gene, protein, reaction or metabolite.
Figure 2. A portion of the cellular overview diagram for E.coli. The pathway in the center of the image is ketogluconate metabolism. The diagram shows all
connections from metabolites in this pathway to other pathways or reactions. This pathway is regulated by three transcription factors—the regulon for each of
these transcription factors is highlighted in a different color, as shown in the key.
3774 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 13
The name can be any name or synonym that is uniquely
associated with the entity in the PGDB. Following the first
column can be any number of data columns. The user speci-
fies whether the first column contains genes, metabolites, pro-
teins, reactions or a mixture of types, and which subsequent
data column or columns are to be used to generate the
display—if multiple data columns are specified then an ani-
mated display is produced. The user indicates whether the
numbers represent relative or absolute measurements,
whether they should be taken from a single column or as
the ratio of two different columns and whether the values
are based on a log or a linear scale. For microarray experi-
ments, the desktop version of the Omics Viewer can also
accept as input the output file generated by SAM [Signifi-
cance Analysis of Microarrays (6)], a plug-in for the Micro-
soft Excel spreadsheet program that combines the results
of multiple repetitions of a single microarray experiment to
produce lists of statistically significant positively and nega-
tively regulated genes.
Most input files contain only a single type of data
(i.e. genes or metabolites, but not both) but it is also possible
to combine multiple types of data into a single file so that
one display can be produced showing a combination of, for
example, gene expression data and metabolite profiling data
from the same set of experimental conditions. In this case,
the metabolite profiling data would color the nodes in the
diagram (representing individual metabolites), and the gene
expression data would be used to color the edges between
the nodes (representing reactions, enzymes and the genes
that code for them). When combining different types of
data in this fashion, keep in mind the caveat that the scales
for the two types of data must be the same in order for the
results to be meaningful. This limitation can be avoided in
the desktop version, where it is possible to overlay the data
from multiple files, specifying a different color scheme for
each to reflect differences in scale.
If a reaction has multiple isozymes, then multiple genes
or proteins will be associated with a single reaction line,
each with its own associated data value. However, on the
full Cellular Overview Diagram there is room to draw
only a single color for each line, so only one of the data
values can be chosen for display (we try to choose the
value expected to be of most interest to users: the highest
value for absolute measurements, or the one that shows the
greatest deviation from 0 or 1 for relative measurements).
We have recently addressed this issue in the desktop Omics
Viewer by allowing users to zero in on pathways of interest
by navigating from the Omics Viewer to an individual
pathway display, where they can see all their omics data
superimposed on a much larger picture of that pathway. In
this individual pathway display, multiple isozymes with
different data values cause the reaction arrows to consist of
multiple parallel lines, with one color for each isozyme.
When accessing the Omics Viewer over the web, we achieve
the same effect, not by including omics data on regular path-
way pages, but by showing it on magnified pathway images
that pop up when the user clicks on a pathway in the cellular
overview diagram—see Figure 3 for an example.
The software can now also generate a table of mag-
nified views of all pathways that have one or more experi-
mental values exceeding a specified threshold, with omics
data painted onto the pathway. An example is shown in
Figure 4.
The Pathway Tools’ capabilities for overlaying multiple
kinds of data onto both the overview as a whole and onto
individual pathways, for showing time course data as an ani-
mation, and for allowing users to specify their own color
schemes are intended to maximize the opportunities for scien-
tists to derive biologically meaningful insights from their
data. Example uses of the Omics Viewer by life sciences
researchers are as follows.
 The Conway laboratory investigated the relative signifi-
cance of individual metabolic pathways for the coloniza-
tion of Escherichia coli in the mouse intestine by analyzing
time series and gene knockout gene expression data using
the Omics Viewer (7).
 The Schoolnik laboratory investigated how the metabolism
of Vibrio cholerae changes, and which metabolic pathways
are selectively up- or down-regulated as the organism
transitions from an aquatic environment to the mammalian
gut, by analyzing gene expression experiments using the
Omics Viewer.
 Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant
Physiology used the Omics Viewer with a combination of
gene expression and metabolite profiling data to identify
and analyze changes in the metabolism of Arabidopsis
thaliana under conditions of sulfur starvation (8). The
Supplementary Data attached to this study includes figures
showing the overview diagram for Arabidopsis super-
imposed first with gene expression data and then with
metabolite profiling data.
 Researchers at TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information
Resource), who maintain and curate a PGDB for
A.thaliana, use the Omics Viewer with metabolite profiling
data to quickly identify pathways involving metabolites
whose quantities change significantly during the course of
an experiment. They also use the Omics Viewer to point
out gaps in knowledge in their PGDB, e.g. if a metabolite
profiling experiment identifies important metabolites that
are missing corresponding pathways in the overview
diagram, this information can suggest targets for future
curation and research efforts.
RELATED WORK
The KEGG database (9), to which the BioCyc databases are
often compared, provides a single overview map for all
organisms in KEGG, which contains links to functionally
related groups of reference pathways. That diagram is not
queryable or interactive in any other way, and there is no
way to find out what individual nodes or lines represent
other than by navigating to an individual reference pathway
map. Pathway Solutions, Inc. provides a web CGI tool for
mapping omics data onto individual KEGG reference path-
way maps (10) (but not onto the full overview diagram),
accepting as inputs either gene names, EC numbers or meta-
bolite IDs. This tool does not offer animations or customized
color schemes.
Reactome (11) has produced an analog of our cellular over-
view diagram. Their diagram can be used for navigation and
querying. It focuses primarily on human pathways, but can
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 13 3775
show subsets applicable to 14 additional eukaryotic model
organisms. The Reactome SkyPainter tool maps omics data
onto the reaction arrows in the overview diagram, including
generating animations for time series data. Because the
Reactome overview contains only reaction arrows, and not
individual metabolites, it is not suitable for displaying meta-
bolomics data. It cannot show omics data on individual path-
ways, nor can it distinguish isozymes. Because all the
overviews for the different model organisms are shown as
subsets of the human overview, many pathways are missing
from the overviews for other organisms. For example,
although Reactome has an overview for A.thaliana, it
includes only those pathways shared between humans and
Arabidopsis, and does not contain any additional plant-
specific pathways.
Other available packages allow mapping of experimental
data onto pathway images in various forms. Examples are
GenMapp (12), VitaPad (13) and ArrayXPath (14). These
packages show only single pathways (their pathways are
often defined somewhat differently), rather than a full cellular
network.
These examples attest to general recognition of the need
for a biochemical overview map, but because the diagrams
associated with these other tools are laid out by hand, their
customizability is limited. Our automated layout algorithms
allow us to generate a customized overview diagram for
each organism, and they can quickly regenerate the diagram
when new pathways are added or spurious ones deleted.
FUTURE WORK
We are considering future extensions to our software to
expand the abilities of users to visualize omics data in the
context of cellular networks, including (i) extending the cel-
lular overview to include representations of different types of
gene products, such as transcriptional regulators, so that these
genes and proteins can also be visualized using the Omics
viewer; (ii) adding eukaryotic subcellular compartments to
the overview; (iii) creating generic non-organism-specific
overviews (such as the one for bacteria, another for plants)
containing all the relevant MetaCyc pathways and (iv) adding
further query operations, such as query by Gene Ontology ID.
