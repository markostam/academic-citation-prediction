[1] Sheeting joints have attracted attention for more than
two centuries, yet their cause has remained unclear.
Sheeting joints are opening mode rock fractures that form
subparallel to the topographic surface and develop to depths
of at least 100 m. They are best developed beneath convex
surfaces in massive rocks where the compressive stress
parallel to the surface (P) is high. A tensile stress normal to
a convex traction-free surface will arise if the product of P
and the surface curvature (k) exceeds the product of the unit
weight of rock (rg) and the cosine of the slope (cosb). The
tensile stress contributes fundamentally to sheeting joints;
erosion of overburden, by itself, does not. Rocks with high
uniaxial compressive strengths host sheeting joints because
they can sustain the high compressive stresses necessary to
generate surface-normal tensile stresses given typical
curvatures in landscapes. Citation: Martel, S. J. (2006),

1. Introduction
[2] Sheeting joints (i.e., ‘‘exfoliation’’ joints) have fasci-
nated and puzzled geologists for more than two centuries
[e.g., Dale, 1923]. They form subparallel to the topographic
surface, are gently curved, and develop well in strong rocks
such as granite, gneiss, massive sandstone, mafic intrusive
rocks, and marble [Matthes, 1930; Jahns, 1943;Holzhausen,
1977, and references therein]. Sheeting joints occur in many
parts of the world [Cadman, 1969, and references therein;
Twidale, 1982; Holzhausen, 1989] and are renowned for
their role in landscape development [Gilbert, 1904;Matthes,
1930; Bradley, 1963]. They strongly influence shallow
groundwater systems [e.g., LeGrand, 1949; Trainer, 1988],
either on their own or by intersecting other fractures to
form a conductive hydrologic network [Borchers, 1996].
They contribute significantly to mass wasting hazards [e.g.,
Terzaghi, 1962; Hermanns and Strecker, 1999; Wieczorek
and Snyder, 1999; Chigara, 2000]. They are associated with
rock bursts in mines and quarries [e.g., Niles, 1871; Dale,
1923; Twidale and Bourne, 2000]. In spite of numerous
studies, however, their cause has remained elusive. Com-
monly cited explanations either fail to account for key
characteristics of sheeting joints or are untenable (or suspect)
on physical grounds.
[3] This manuscript shows directly how compressive
stresses parallel to convex portions of the Earth’s topo-
graphic surface can generate tensile stresses normal to the
surface, a mechanism considered previously by Holzhausen
[1977] and Miller and Dunne [1996] for particular idealized
geometries and boundary conditions. This manuscript
describes key characteristics of sheeting joints, reviews
traditional explanations for the joints, presents the funda-
mental theoretical requirements for the proposed mecha-
nism, and tests it against existing data.
2. Sheeting Joint Characteristics
[4] Sheeting joints form subparallel to the topographic
surface (Figure 1). They occur most commonly where the
topography is convex and can extend in plane at least 200 m
[Gilbert, 1904; Matthes, 1930; Jahns, 1943]. They occur
from within a meter of the present surface to depths in
excess of 100 m, and with depth their spacing usually
increases while their curvature decreases [Jahns, 1943].
They typically develop independent of grain scale structure
of the rock (e.g., foliation) and cross cut contacts between
different rock units [Jahns, 1943].
[5] Field observations of sheeting joints overwhelmingly
favor an opening mode origin. The joints locally have
apertures as great as several centimeters, although their
walls typically are in contact, and show little or no evidence
of slip [e.g., Dale, 1923; Matthes, 1930; Holzhausen, 1989].
The joints also end in a pattern of echelon fractures and
display surface textures characteristic of opening mode
fractures in rock [Segall and Pollard, 1983; Pollard and
Aydin, 1988; Holzhausen, 1989].
[6] Sheeting joints are among the youngest structures in
rock outcrops. They mimic the topography, which in many
areas has developed in the last few million years. Some
have formed since late Pleistocene glacial episodes, even
during quarry operations [Holzhausen, 1989]. These find-
ings indicate that analysis of current conditions might
illuminate how sheeting joints form.
[7] High compressive stresses parallel to the surface
consistently have been either inferred from field observa-
tions [e.g., Niles, 1871; Dale, 1923; Matthes, 1930; Jahns,
1943] or measured (Table 1) where sheeting joints exist.
Surface-parallel compressive stresses of 10–30 MPa at
depths of several meters or less are common. These levels
exceed the uniaxial compressive strength of weak rocks but
not massive rocks such as granites [Bell, 1993]. This
manuscript focuses on an effect of surface-parallel com-
pression along a curved surface instead of its causes [e.g.,
Turcotte and Schubert, 2002].
3. Traditional Explanations
[8] Erosion of overburden, although widely cited as the
cause for sheeting joints, cannot be an essential cause by
itself. First, eroded terrains generally lack sheeting joints.

Second, although a reduction of vertical compressive stress
during erosion will lead to a vertical rebound (strain) of the
rock, erosion by itself does not produce a tensile stress
normal to the surface, something needed to open sheeting
joints.
[9] Residual grain-scale stresses also are rejected as a
cause. First, microscopic examinations show grains along
joints typically are fresh and lack signs of grain-scale
hydration and chemical alteration [Jahns, 1943]; this rules
out chemical effects as a source for grain-scale residual
stresses. Second, if residual tensile stresses from any source
caused the joints to form in-place at a quarry site, then the
fractures should continue form in the extracted rock after it
is quarried, yet this does not occur [Holzhausen, 1989]. In
situ factors must therefore control the formation of sheeting
joints, not the intrinsic condition of the rock.
[10] Opening mode fractures can develop in solids with
cavities or flaws in response to uniaxial compression, but
experiments show that they tend to stabilize after attaining a
length of a few cavity or flaw dimensions [Brace and
Bombolakis, 1963; Nemat-Nasser and Horii, 1982]. Theo-
retical analyses indicate that a nearby free surface assists
fracture growth [Germanovich and Dyskin, 2000], but
whether fracture-parallel compression alone can account
for sheeting joints hundreds of meters long is unclear,
especially when the weight of overburden is accounted for.
4. Compression Along a Curved Surface
[11] Figure 2 shows how a compressive stress (P) parallel
to the convex surface of an infinitesimal weightless element
can induce a tension normal to the surface (N). The convex
upper surface is traction-free, and no shear tractions (t)
exist on the boundary of the element. The compressive
(negative) tractions on the canted element ends yield a net
force directed away from the center of curvature. That force
must be opposed by tensile tractions at the base of the
element to maintain equilibrium.
[12] Instead of solving a particular boundary value prob-
lem, I use the equations of equilibrium to provide general
quantitative insight into near-surface stress conditions when
a body force due to gravity is present. These equations are
entirely independent of rheology. For a body in plane strain,
the equations for a cylindrical reference frame are [Chou
and Pagano, 1967]:
@N
@r
þ 1
r
@t
@q
þ N  P
r
þ Fr ¼ 0; ð1aÞ
1
r
@P
@q
þ @t
@r
þ 2t
r
þ Fq ¼ 0; ð1bÞ
where Fr and Fq are the radial and tangential components of
the gravitational body force, respectively, r is the radial
distance, and q provides the angular position (Figure 2).
Only equation (1a) contains the critical term N, and it can be
simplified to describe conditions at a traction-free surface
by some substitutions. First, N = t = 0. Next, note that
(a) the magnitude of curvature of the surface jkj = 1/r, and
(b) Fr = rgcosb, where r is the rock density, g is
gravitational acceleration, and b is the slope at the surface.

pressive (negative) end loads (P). The upper surface of
radius r is traction-free. The lower surface is subject to basal
normal tractions (N). No shear tractions (t) act on the
boundary of this element. If body forces (e.g., gravity) are
absent and if P is compressive, then N must be tensile
(positive) for equilibrium. Fractures would form parallel to
the surface where N becomes sufficiently large.

This equation applies to all cylindrical surface geometries,
and when body forces are absent it matches the
corresponding Lame´-Maxwell equation of equilibrium
[Ramsay and Lisle, 2000]. For a spherical surface [Chou
and Pagano, 1967] the same equation results, except that
P must be interpreted as sum of the two principal stresses
parallel to the spherically curved surface (i.e., P = P1 +
P2). For a flat horizontal surface, k = b = 0, and the
lithostatic vertical stress inhibits sheeting fracture growth.
A tensile stress normal to the surface must develop in the
shallow subsurface, however, where @N/@z is positive
(e.g., where kP > rg), since N = 0 at the surface. For a
convex surface, k is negative, and if P is also negative
(compressive), then kP is positive. For the Earth as a
whole, k = 1.6  107 m1 and kP is negligible
compared to the lithostatic gradient (rg). In many
places, however, jkj locally exceeds 103 m1, kP can
exceed rg, and fractures would open subparallel to the
surface. Where a convex slope has even a small angular
bend, jkj is very large and fractures could open even for
tiny values of P.
5. Analysis of Current Conditions
[13] Table 1 shows principal stress magnitudes from near-
surface measurements where sheeting joints exist, together
with curvature values in the direction of P1. The stress
values for Tuolumne Meadows are applied to nearby
Cathedral Peak and to Olmstead Pt., which is 13.5 km
southwest. All other values are from sites on or adjacent to
the respective slopes where the curvatures are measured.
The most compressive stress (P1) generally is between –10
and –30 MPa in Table 1. The peak in situ compressive
stresses could exceed the tabulated values by as much as
7 MPa depending on thermal stresses [Holzhausen, 1989].
The curvature range is determined from a parabolic arc fit
to the endpoints and the high point along a profile parallel
to the trend of the most compressive stress (Figure 3).
[14] Equation (2) can be used to test whether current
stresses and curvatures at or near the surface meet the
minimum threshold for sheeting joints to open. Figure 4
shows P plotted against the curvature values for the sites of
Table 1. The values of P range from P1 to P1 + P2 to cover
the topographic spectrum from ridges to domes, respec-
tively. Conditions at five of the sites either meet or straddle
the fracture threshold curve; sheeting joints might be form-
ing there now. For the three sites farthest from the threshold
(Kittredge Hill, Oak Hill, and Pine Mtn), kP is 30%–50%
of the threshold level. Two main possibilities emerge for
why current conditions fall below threshold values, assum-
ing that the stress measurements do not have systematic
errors. First, the regional compressive stresses might have
diminished since the time of jointing. Second, the topo-
graphic curvature might be less now than when the joints
formed because of erosion. Independent evidence favors this
option. Jahns [1943] found evidence of at least 8–13 meters
of local glacial erosion after the joints formed at Kittredge
Hill, and at least 33 meters at Oak Hill; these amounts
are 30%–50% of the current relief of the respective hills
(Figure 3). Although erosion can locally increase curva-
ture, it generally flattens slopes and reduces the overall
curvature, especially if the erosion is focused at a summit,
where the curvature commonly is largest. The current
curvatures at Kittredge Hill and Oak Hill almost surely
are lower now then when the joints formed and do not
preclude the proposed mechanism.
6. Discussion
[15] The proposed mechanism accounts for more than the
presence and orientation of sheeting joints. It accounts for
their subparallel nature and substantial overlap, a pattern

Table 1, with parabolic curves fit to the endpoints of the
profiles and the profile highpoint. The horizontal and
vertical scales are not equal.

threshold curve kP = rg.

predicted only for opening mode fractures that grow where
the difference between the ambient principal stresses is large
relative to the tensile stress fracturing the rock [Olson and
Pollard, 1989]. Here, P is usually more negative than
10 MPa (Table 1 and Figure 4), and N is controlled by
the tensile strength of the rock, which is no more than
several MPa and positive [Holzhausen, 1989; Bell, 1993].
The difference between P and N thus is large relative to N,
meeting the condition for subparallel, highly overlapped
joints. The proposed mechanism can also account for the
tendency of the joint spacing to increase with depth and for
the joints to be closed. When each joint opens, N is reset to
zero at the joint. The observed decrease in joint curvature
with depth (Figure 1) will decrease the right side of equation
(2), so the distance z required for the surface-normal tensile
stress N to build to the level required for fracture will
increase with depth. Erosion after the time of jointing will
tend to lessen the surface curvature, and hence N, even if the
surface-parallel compressive stresses are maintained. When
N drops below zero the joint walls would close. The
mechanism accounts for a broad variety of the essential
characteristics of sheeting joints.
[16] Sheeting joints are well developed in massive
rocks and are absent where the rock is heavily fractured
or weathered. Reports of sheeting joints in weak rocks
such as shales are conspicuous in their absence. These
findings support the hypothesis that rock masses must be
able to withstand high compressive stresses in order to
develop sufficient tensile stresses normal to the rock mass
surface to open sheeting joints. The proposed mechanism
not only accounts for the presence of sheeting joints in
strong rocks such as granites, gneisses, and massive
sandstones, but also their scarcity or absence in weak or
weathered rock.
[17] The vertical normal stress typically is assumed to be
just due to the weight of the overburden, in spite of near-
surface measurements to the contrary [e.g., Martin et al.,
2003]. Where the local relief is large and the horizontal
compressive stresses are too, however, the vertical normal
stress can depart substantially from lithostatic pressure [see
also Savage and Swolfs, 1986; Miller and Dunne, 1996].
Predicting and controlling hydraulic fractures and the
stability of wells will be difficult in certain cases if the
interaction of the Earth’s stresses with the topographic
surface is not accounted for.
[18] Many issues bearing on the process of sheeting joint
formation remain to be addressed. These include how
sheeting joints interact, the shapes they assume as they
propagate, the distances they extend beyond their region of
nucleation, and why they exist in slopes that are now
concave in cross section [Gilbert, 1904; Matthes, 1930;
Jahns, 1943]. Detailed mapping of sheeting joints and
the associated topography, together with three-dimensional
mechanical analyses, would shed light on all these matters.
7. Conclusions
[19] The effect of topography on the stresses near the
surface of the Earth can be profound [e.g., Molnar, 2004].
The equations of equilibrium show that a compressive
(negative) stress parallel to a convex traction-free surface
will cause near-surface tensile stresses to arise normal to the
surface if the product of the curvature and the surface-
parallel stress exceeds the product of the unit weight of the
rock and the cosine of the slope. These stresses contribute
fundamentally to sheeting joint formation.
