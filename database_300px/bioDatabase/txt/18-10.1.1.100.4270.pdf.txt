ABSTRACT
The Gene Expression Database (GXD) provides the
scientific community with an extensive and easily
searchable database of gene expression information
about the mouse. Its primary emphasis is on deve-
lopmental studies. By integrating different types of
expression data, GXD aims to provide comprehen-
sive information about expression patterns of tran-
scripts and proteins in wild-type and mutant mice.
Integration with the other Mouse Genome Infor-
matics (MGI) databases places the gene expression
information in the context of genetic, sequence,
functional and phenotypic information, enabling
valuable insights into the molecular biology that
underlies developmental and disease processes. In
recent years the utility of GXD has been greatly
enhanced by a large increase in data content, obtai-
ned from the literature and provided by researchers
doing large-scale in situ and cDNA screens. In
addition, we have continued to refine our query and
display features to make it easier for users to
interrogate the data. GXD is available through
the MGI web site at http://www.informatics.jax.org/
or directly at http://www.informatics.jax.org/menus/
expression_menu.shtml.
INTRODUCTION
The laboratory mouse serves as a premier animal model in
studying the complex molecular networks that underlie the
processes of human development, differentiation and disease.
To gain insights into these networks, it is essential to know
where, when and in what amounts transcripts and proteins
are expressed, and how their expression varies in different
mouse strains and mutants. The Gene Expression Database
(GXD) addresses this objective in a uniquely comprehensive
way. GXD is the only resource that acquires mouse expres-
sion data from the literature in a systematic manner, as well
as acquiring data directly from conventional and large-scale
providers via electronic data submission and bulk data down-
loads. GXD integrates various types of mRNA and protein
expression information, collects data from all tissue and
developmental stages and includes data from many different
mouse strains and mutants. Annotations in GXD make
extensive use of controlled vocabularies and ontologies to
provide the standardization of data that enables complex
queries. In addition, GXD is fully integrated with the other
databases of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource,
including the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) (1,2) and the
MGI part of the Gene Ontology Project (GO) (3). MGI also
maintains comprehensive links to external resources such as
sequence databases, Entrez Gene, UniProt, InterPro, Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), PubMed and other
mammalian databases (4–15). This robust integration puts
the expression data annotated in GXD into a much larger bio-
logical and analytical context. Thus, users are able to query
using extensive genetic, sequence, functional, expression
and phenotypic information.
Other public and laboratory databases have been developed
in recent years to store mouse expression data (16–26). They
store data from one or two specific assay types and/or focus
on specific tissues/developmental stages; they are often
dedicated to specific data generation projects. These data-
bases are complementary to the GXD effort. Due to its
broad scope, its thorough approach and its data integration
and querying capabilities, though, GXD provides a unique
resource to the biomedical research community. New data
are entered and made publicly available on a daily basis.
GXD and its query interfaces have been described previously
(27–30). Here we focus on recent progress in terms of data
acquisition and querying capabilities.
DATA CONTENT
The Gene Expression Literature Index
GXD curators survey journals to find all published papers that
describe endogenous gene expression and knock-in reporter
studies done in the embryonic mouse. In a first annotation
step, the curators record the genes and ages analyzed and
the expression assay types used in these publications. GXD

combines these data with information obtained from PubMed
and makes them available for searching via the Gene Expres-
sion Literature Index. Therefore, users can query for specific
types of expression information in combination with biblio-
graphic information (author, journal, year) or specific words
in the title or abstract of publications. The Literature Index
is comprehensive and up-to-date; it contains all pertinent
journal articles from 1993 to the present and articles from
major developmental journals from 1990 to the present.
Currently, the index contains >56 500 entries covering nearly
12 300 references analyzing nearly 8700 genes. Thus, it
provides a powerful tool to quickly locate expression
information in the literature.
Gene expression data
GXD currently collects detailed expression data from the
following assay types: RNA in situ hybridization,
immunohistochemistry, in situ reporter (knock in), northern
blot, RT–PCR, western blot, RNase protection and nuclease
S1 protection studies. Work is underway to incorporate
microarray data as well. As illustrated in Figure 1, expression
records in GXD are detailed. Each entry contains a descrip-
tion of the assay type and the molecular probe used in the
assay, the genetic origin of the sample and the experimental
conditions used. The time and tissue of expression, the
authors’ description of pattern and strength of expression,
the number and sizes of detected bands and sequence
information are also recorded. Expression patterns are des-
cribed using an extensive dictionary of standardized anatomi-
cal terms that lists the anatomical structures for each
developmental stage in a hierarchical fashion, thus enabling
the recording of expression results from assays with different
spatial resolution in a consistent manner. The embryonic part
of the anatomical dictionary was developed by our collabora-
tors from the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas and Gene Expression
Figure 1. GXD contains detailed expression annotations. This record for an RNA in situ hybridization assay (left) illustrates the details included in annotations of
expression results. It reports the reference the data were derived from, the assay type and the gene analyzed. Details regarding the nucleotide probe (or antibody)
used in the assay are entered into the database and can be accessed via a link on the expression detail page; the detail page for the nucleotide probe used in this
assay is pictured (upper right). In the Specimens Used section, the genetic background, age, sex and preparation method of the specimens are described; links are
provided to pages that detail the characteristics of mutants used. In the Results section, we report the Theiler stage and tissue examined, as well as the level and
pattern of expression as described by the author. If it is a blot assay, the number and sizes of detected bands are reported. We have permission from several
publishers, as well as from researchers who have contributed data to us directly, to provide images of the original expression data (lower right) to help users
analyze the results.

Database (EMAGE) project (31); the adult part was devel-
oped by the GXD project (32). As well as enabling complex
querying capabilities, these detailed annotations make it
easier to interpret and compare expression data.
GXD’s data content has increased significantly in recent
years (Figure 2). Currently, GXD contains data from
>24 600 assays that provide >260 000 detailed expression res-
ults for nearly 7700 genes, including expression data from
almost 1000 different mouse mutants. Two-thirds of these
data are linked to images of the primary expression data;
GXD currently contains >43 000 images of expression data.
This rapid growth in data content was made possible by the
daily annotation of expression data from the literature and
through the incorporation of large sets of expression data
from large-scale RNA in situ hybridization and RT–PCR
screens. Recently acquired large data sets include: RNA
in situ and RT–PCR studies of mouse genes homologous to
human chromosome 21 genes (33,34); RNA in situ studies
that analyzed expression patterns of >1300 transcription fac-
tors in the developing mouse brain (35); RNA in situ studies
examining the expression of >1000 genes during retinal
development (36); and RNA in situ and RT–PCR studies of
>300 RNA-binding protein encoding genes in the developing
mouse brain (37). In these instances curators worked with the
researchers to fully integrate into GXD the large amounts of
supplemental material that accompanied these publications.
Curators worked with the laboratories to bring the data into
standardized formats and to resolve issues pertinent to
nomenclature and referential integrity; the data was reviewed
both computationally and manually. The integration of these
data into GXD greatly expands the research community’s
ability to query these data, increasing their utility.
GXD also stores expression data on the tissue or cell-line
source of mouse cDNA clones, data mainly acquired via
large data downloads. We have made strong progress in
this area. In collaboration with the other members of the
FANTOM consortium, including our colleagues from the
MGD, we incorporated all cDNA data derived from the FAN-
TOM project into GXD (38–40). We have also incorporated
all other publicly available mouse cDNA and EST data,
including cDNA data from the I.M.A.G.E consortium, the
sets from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) (41,42) and
the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) (43,44). We have
loaded each clone’s IDs and sequence information, including
ESTs and any longer sequences that are known. Clone
records have been associated with genes via manual curation
and computational analysis of sequence associations. Like-
wise, using coordinated automatic and manual processes,
we have mapped the source information for each cDNA lib-
rary (such as information about strain, tissue, cell line and
sex) to our controlled vocabularies. Thus, all the cDNA
source data are now recorded in standardized form. This
annotation and integration of all these data allows users to
do comprehensive, expression-related queries based on
cDNA source information. Currently GXD contains data for
>1.7 million clones for nearly 28 000 genetic markers.
The Gene Expression Notebook
GXD’s usefulness is directly proportional to the amount of
data it contains, but extracting data from the literature is a
time-intensive process. Therefore, to facilitate direct submis-
sions of expression data from the research community, we
have developed the Gene Expression Notebook (GEN).
Figure 2. Quantity and type of detailed expression results in GXD. Since first released in June 1998, the amount of data in GXD has steadily increased to
>260 000 results today. More than half of these results are from RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and in situ reporter (knock in) assays; these
studies yield complex descriptions of expression patterns. The remaining results were obtained from blot assays.
D620 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue
GEN is an Excel-based application designed to function as an
electronic notebook to store and organize expression data and
images in the laboratory. Researchers can then, with minimal
additional effort, select data stored in the GEN and submit it
to GXD. Data submissions are reviewed by GXD curators
and receive accession numbers that can be cited in publica-
tions. GEN has been described in detail previously (45).
Since then we have developed new versions of the GEN to
be compatible with recent versions of Excel: 2000, 2003
and X. GEN is freely available for download at: http://
www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/GXD/GEN/.
ACCESSING GXD’S EXPRESSION DATA
Users primarily access GXD using web-based query forms.
A complete listing of our query forms is provided in the sup-
plementary material. The standard (Figure 3) and expanded
Gene Expression Data query forms provide access to the
detailed expression data. Both forms provide users with
a wide variety of query fields to allow them to extract the
data from the database that is of the most interest to them.
The expanded GXD query form is designed to allow users
to query for genes expressed in some anatomical structures
and/or developmental stages but not others. The functionality
of the map position section on these forms (as well as on the
cDNA clone query form) was expanded to allow searching
by genome coordinates and by a range of markers. When
combined with the previously existing ability to search by
centiMorgan position and cytogenetic band, users have a
powerful tool to limit their expression searches to specified
chromosomal regions, useful when doing positional cloning
studies to hunt for candidate genes. All queries in GXD,
including those from the standard and expanded query
forms, return data summaries; an example is pictured in
Figure 3. Links in the Results Detail column of these sum-
mary pages provide access to our detailed data entries; an
example of a detailed entry is provided in Figure 1.
GXD is implemented in the Sybase relational database
management system. For those users who wish to perform
custom queries or analyses not possible through the web-
based query forms, direct SQL access or custom database
reports can be requested from User Support (contact details
supplied below).
MOUSE GENE EXPRESSION INFORMATION
RESOURCE
GXD has a longstanding collaboration with the EMAGE
project (16). EMAGE provides for 3D graphical storage
of mouse developmental in situ expression patterns (from
wild-type mice). GXD makes all pertinent text-annotated
in situ data, including primary image data, available to
EMAGE so that it can be spatially mapped. EMAGE
already provides links from its Anatomical Section Browser
Figure 3. Querying for detailed expression data. The standard Gene Expression Data query form (left) allows users to query expression data using the parameters
that are of most interest to them. Searchable fields include gene symbol/name (and synonyms); map position, anatomical structure, developmental stage and
assay type. The Gene Ontology (GO) Classifications field allows users to search for genes that have specific molecular functions, are involved in particular
biological processes or associated with specific subcellular components. Anatomical structures are named according to a controlled vocabulary system. Due to
the hierarchical structure of this vocabulary, spatial queries can include anatomical substructures or superstructures. The Mutated Gene field allows querying for
expression data in specific mutants. The query formulated in the figure uses three search parameters to ask for transcription factors expressed in the somites of
N-cadherin (Cdh2) mutants. The results summary (right) lists the symbol of the gene examined, the assay type used, result details (given as an MGI accession
ID linked to an assay record), allele pairs describing the mutant genotype of the specimen, age of the specimen, anatomical structure examined and whether or
not expression was detected. Clicking on the boxed accession IDs will yield the detailed expression record pictured in Figure 1.

GXD is in the process of adding links to EMAGE. The ulti-
mate goal of the collaboration between our two databases is
the creation of the Mouse Gene Expression Information
Resource (MGEIR) that will fully combine standardized
text-based and graphical means for storing and querying
expression data (46).
