Abstract
Source apportionment of total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) and associated heavy metals has 
been carried out for the city of Delhi using the Chemical Mass Balance Model, Version 8 (CMB8), as 
well as principle component analysis (PCA) of SPSS (Varimax Rotated Factor Matrix method) in 
coarse- and fine-size mode. Urban particles were collected using a five-stage impactor at six sites in the 
winter of 2005-06. The impactor segregates the TSPM into five different size ranges (viz. > 10.9, 10.9–
5.4, 5.4–1.6, 1.6–0.7 and < 0.7 μm). Four samples were collected from six different sites every 24 
hours. Samples were analyzed in five size ranges gravimetrically and chemically for the estimation of 
SPM and metals. The five different size ranges were divided into two broad categories: coarse (1.6 to > 
10.9 μm) and fine (< 1.6 μm). The CMB8 and PCA were executed separately for both coarse and fine 
size ranges. Results obtained by CMB8 indicate the dominance of vehicular pollutants (62%), followed 
by crustal dust (35%) in the fine size range; while in the coarse size range crustal dust dominated (64%) 
over vehicular pollution (29%). Little contribution from paved-road dust and industrial sources was 
observed. Results of PCA (or factor analysis) reveal two major sources (vehicular and crustal re-
suspension) in both coarse and fine size ranges. The correlations of factors (sources) with the metals 
show that in the coarse size range the dominant source is crustal re-suspension (68%) followed by 
vehicular pollution (23%). However, this is reversed in the case of the fine size range factor analysis 
where vehicular pollution (86%) dominated over crustal re-suspension (10%).

INTRODUCTION
Delhi, the capital of India is one of the 10 
most polluted cities in world. It is the second 
largest Indian city with a population of over 14 
million, with 1.3% of India’s population. The 
188
Srivastava et al., Aerosol and Air Quality Research, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 188-200, 2008 
annual average growth rate of Delhi’s 
population is 3.85%, but the annual average 
vehicular growth rate is 5.85% (Economic 
Survey of Delhi, 2006). The transportation 
network in Delhi is predominantly road based 
with 1284 km of road per 100 km2. Over 4.8 
million vehicles travel Delhi’s roads today. The 
number of vehicles is expected to reach 26 
million in 2011. It is estimated that over 3000 
metric tons of air pollutants are emitted in Delhi 
daily (MOEF, 2002).  
This alarming vehicular growth rate, frequent 
traffic jams and not much improvement in the 
number of roads has resulted in a significant 
rise in the TSPM (total suspended particulate 
matter) level of Delhi. However, although 
vehicles continue to be the biggest contributor 
to the Delhi’s ambient TSPM level, significant 
contributions from other pollution sources, such 
as roadside dust, industries, trans-boundary 
migrations, power plants, solid waste and local 
sources, have also been observed (Srivastava 
and Jain, 2006; Srivastava and Jain, 2007). 
Particulate matter from these sources may 
contain hazardous pollutants and can have 
carcinogenic and mutagenic effects. Thus, 
identification of the sources and estimates of 
their contributions are important.
Several methods are used to estimate source 
contributions, including principle component 
analysis (PCA or Factor Analysis), multiple 
linear regression analysis (MLR) and the 
Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) Receptor 
Model. In the present investigation, we have 
applied both CMB and PCA for the source 
apportionment of TSPM in the ambient air of 
Delhi. CMB models are fundamental receptor 
models and very useful for coarse and fine 
particle source apportionment (CMB8, 1997). 
CMB models estimate source contributions by 
determining the best-fit combination of 
emission source chemical composition profiles 
needed to reconstruct the chemical composition 
of ambient samples (Watson et al., 1991; 
Watson et al., 1994; Schauer et al., 1996). 
While the PCA method focuses on cleaning up 
the factors, it also produces factors that have 
high correlations with one smaller set of 
variables and little or no correlation with 
another set of variables (Stevens, 1996).  
Many studies have been conducted on the 
source apportionment of different fractions of 
TSPM and metals in various parts of the world 
using different techniques (Artaxo et al., 1990; 
Kashara et al., 1990; Watson et al., 1994; 
Anderson et al., 1995; Hidy et al., 1996; Vega 
et al., 1997; Adgate et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998; 
Biegalski et al., 1998; Batterman et al., 1988; 
Cheng et al., 1989; Ames et al., 2000; Bhave et
al., 2001; Billheimer, 2001; Chen et al., 2001; 
Chow et al.,2002; Christensen et al., 2004; 
Salma et al., 2005; Arditsoglou and Samara 
2005; Gupta et al., 2006). Recently, some 
important studies have been carried out using 
CMB receptor models and the PCA method: 
Breed et al. (2002) determined the possible 
sources of PM10 in Prince George (Canada) 
based on morphology and in situ chemical 
composition of the particulate matter.  Samara 
et al. (2003) applied CMB source 
apportionment of PM10 in an industrialized 
urban area of northern Greece. Samara (2005) 
identified sources of TSP using CMB in a 
lignite burning area of Macedonia, Greece. 
189
Srivastava et al., Aerosol and Air Quality Research, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 188-200, 2008 
Zheng (2005) studied the seasonal trend of 
sources of PM2.5 in Beijing.
However, in India studies on source 
apportionment by CMB are rather limited. 
Sharma and Patil (1992, 1994) used CMB and 
PCA respectively for source apportionment of 
aerosols in Bombay. Srivastava (2004) and 
Srivastava et al. (2005) carried out source 
apportionment of ambient VOCs in Mumbai 
and Delhi, respectively, using CMB8. 
Srivastava and Jain (2007a,c) carried out source 
apportionment studies using CMB and PCA, 
respectively, on data collected in 2001. In the 
present study, we assessed the air quality of 
Delhi at a time when almost all the public 
transport is compressed natural gas (CNG) 
fueled and metro rails have been introduced on 
some fixed routes. In this paper, an attempt has 
been made to assess the various sources of fine 
and coarse particulates in Delhi using CMB8 
and PCA methods. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Area descriptions
Fig. 1. Wind rose pattern of Delhi during 
sampling (Dec 10, 05 – Jan 20, 06). 
Sampling was carried out at six different sites 
in Delhi. Delhi has three coal-based thermal 
power plants and over 125,000 industrial units 
(Government of India, 2001). It lies in the 
subtropical belt, characterized by a semi-arid 
climate, which consists of summer (March–
May), monsoon (June–Aug), post-monsoon 
(Sep–Nov) and winter (Dec–Feb) seasons. It 
experiences a maximum temperature of a45–
48к in June during summer and a minimum of 
a1–2к in January during winter. It has a 
normal annual rainfall of 611 mm. The air over 
Delhi is dry most of the year. Humidity is high 
in the monsoon season, while April and May 
are the driest months. Winds are predominantly 
westerly or northwesterly and tend to be more 
northerly in the afternoons, except in the 
monsoon season, when it is easterly and 
northeasterly. Yearly mean wind speed varies in 
the range of 0.9–2.0 m/s. The April to June 
period witnesses the highest frequency of 
thunderstorms and dust storms. These storms 
are generally dry, but some are accompanied by 
heavy rains. During the course of sampling, 
max, min temperature and max, min relative 
humidity were 21.0, 4.9OC and 90.4, 45.0%, 
respectively. The wind rose pattern of Delhi is 
shown in Fig. 1. 
Sampling sites 
Sampling was performed from December 10, 
2005 to January 20, 2006 at six different sites. 
Their locations are indicated in Fig. 2. The 
details of each category of sites and number of 
samples along with the sampling duration are 
given in Table 1.

Sampling procedure
Sampling was done with a five-stage cascade 
particulate separator (Kimoto Electric Co. Ltd. 
Japan). It was operated at an average flow rate

of 600 L/min with 24 h continuous samples 
obtained from each site for four days. The 
samples were collected on EPM-2000, 
Whatman GF/A glass fiber filters. Each set of 
samples consisted of five different sized filters 
for various size ranges. The size ranges of the 
particles and the sizes of corresponding filters 
used for each size are provided in Table 2. The 
filters were kept in vacuum desiccators for 24 
h to remove any moisture content, and then 
weighed by a precision micro balance (Mettler 
AE 50). Afterwards, they were mounted on the 
air sampler. After sampling, the filters were 
immediately transferred to vacuum desiccators 
to again de-moisturize in the same manner and 
then again weighed. The difference in pre- and 
post-sampling weights were used for the 
estimation of TSPM.  
Analysis
Acid digestion, required for the metals 
determination by AAS, was carried out 
according to a standard procedure (Katz, 1977). 
Acid digestion was performed in Teflon bombs 
following these steps. Step 1: Sub samples of 
dry filters were dissolved in 3 mL HF, 6 mL 
HNO3 and 1.5 mL HCl in Teflon bombs at 
120к for 1 h; Step 2: Digestates were 
evaporated to dryness at 70к for 1/2 h; Step 3: 
Residues were re-dissolved in 10 mL of 10 M 
HNO3 and evaporated to dryness. Step 3 was 
repeated until residues were fully dissolved. A 
series of blanks were prepared using the same 
digestion method. Standard solutions of metals 
were prepared as described in the USEPA 
manual (1983) and AAS manual (1983). Metals 
and reagents used for standard solutions were 
of AR grade. The reagents used were HNO3
70% (S.G. 1.41), HCl 36% (S.G. 1.18) and HF 
40% (S.G. 1.13). 
Source apportionment methodology
To carry out source apportionment in two 
different size ranges the samples collected were 
broadly divided in two categories: coarse and 
fine. Coarse size particles represented the sum 
total of particles of size ranges: > 10.9, 10.9–
5.4 and 5.4–1.6 ȝm, while the fine particles 
represented the sum total of particles of size 
ranges: 1.6–0.7 and < 0.7 ȝm. To gain a better 
understanding of the dominant sources in Delhi, 
two different source apportionment techniques 
were applied: Chemical Mass Balance Receptor 
Model, Version 8 (CMB8) and the Principle 
Component Analysis (PCA).

In this study, a chemical mass balance 
receptor model, CMB8 (CMB, 1997; USEPA, 
1997; Watson et al., 1997) was used to 
apportion the sources contributing to the 
ambient coarse and fine particles in Delhi. The 
basic principle of the receptor model may be 
expressed by an empirical relationship given in 
Eq. (1). This represents the relationship 
between the concentrations of the chemical 
species measured at the receptor site to those 
emitted from the source.

Where Ci is the ambient concentrations of the 
species i, measured at the receptor site, P is the 
number of sources that contribute, Fij is the 
fraction of the emissions of the species i
starting from the source j, and Sj the ambient 
contribution of the source j. The model fit is 
considered ‘good’ if the values of the following 
statistical parameters lie within the acceptable 
range given along with them (Watson et al.,
1997):
(i) Fraction of variance in measured 
concentrations, explained by the variation in 
calculated concentrations (R2) more than 0.8, 
Weighted sum of squares of the difference 
between calculated and measured fitting species 
concentration (Ȥ2) less than 4,
(ii)Degree of freedom (DF) greater than 5,  
(iii) Percent of aerosol mass explained by 
sources between 80-120,
(iv) Ratio of calculated to measured 
concentration (C/M ratio) between 0.5 – 2, and
(v)Absolute value of ratio of residual to 
uncertainty (R/U) less than 4. 
Source profiles
The sources of 11 metals (Mn, Cr, Cd, Cu, 
Co, Pb, Ni, Fe, Zn, Mg and Ca) for both coarse 
and fine suspended particles were determined. 
It is important to note that the source profiles 
for Indian cities have not been compiled. Thus, 
the metals source profiles used were taken from 
the USEPA (Speciate 3.2, 2002) database and 
some of the previous work carried out in Delhi 
(Khemani et al., 1985; Mehra et al., 1998; 
Balachandran et al., 2000; Gadi et al., 2000; 
Anju and Banerjee, 2003; Srivastava and Jain 
2003; Khillare et al., 2004; Monkkonen et al.,
2004; Srivastava and Jain 2005; Yadav and 
Rajamani 2006; Srivastava and Jain 2007a,,b,c). 
The emission sources considered were (i) Soil 
and crustal dust, (ii) Paved road dusts, (ii) 
Vehicular emissions, and (iv) Industrial sources.
Principle component analysis
To identify and estimate the possible sources 
of coarse and fine size particles, a PCA, or 
factor analysis, method was applied. PCA was 
performed by the Varimax Rotated Factor 
Matrix method, based on the orthogonal 
193
Srivastava et al., Aerosol and Air Quality Research, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 188-200, 2008 
rotation criterion which maximizes the variance 
of the squared elements in the column of a 
factor matrix, using a statistical package SPSS 
(Version 9). This method focuses on cleaning 
up the factors. It produces factors that have 
high correlations with one smaller set of 
variables and little or no correlation with 
another set of variables (Stevens, 1996).  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Source apportionment was carried out for 
both coarse and fine size ranges of TSPM using

in both coarse and fine size fractions; i.e., 3 
and 2%, respectively. The contribution from 
paved road dust is somewhat more for coarse 
particles (4%) than fine particles (1%). The 
results obtained in this study are not in 
agreement with those from the previous study 
by Srivastava and Jain (2007a) in which it was 
observed that vehicular pollution dominates in 
both coarse and fine size ranges. This study 
was carried out before the implementation of 
compressed natural gas vehicles (CNG). 
Therefore, we can conclude that after the 
implementation of CNG, although vehicles 
continue to be the largest polluters of Delhi’s 
ambient air, their over-contribution is now 
confined to fine particles only, while soil and 
crustal dust are now the predominant 
contributors to coarse particles.
Source apportionment by PCA 
To validate the results obtained by CMB, a 
PCA was performed by the Varimax Rotated 
Factor Matrix method of SPSS for both coarse 
and fine size fractions. Sites were assumed to 
be repetitive of data, while metals were treated 
as the variable. A total of nine components were 
obtained, out of which two were extracted as 
principle components (Eigenvalue > 1) for both 
coarse and fine size ranges. The detailed results 
are given in Table 4. In case of coarse particles, 
two PCs were obtained, first and second PCs 
contribute about 68 and 23%, respectively. 
Considering a correlation coefficient of  0.5, 
the metals correlated with factor 1 points it to 
be the crustal re-suspension source and factor 2 
as the vehicular source. It is important to note 
that the metals generated from various sources

et al., 2004; Khillare et al., 2004). The 
condition is reversed in the case of fine 
particulate source apportionment. Again, two 
PCs were obtained, contributing about 86 and

metals and factors suggests factor 1 as 
vehicular source and factor 2 as crustal re-
suspension. The differentiation between 
vehicular source and crustal re-suspension was 
made keeping in mind the association of Ca 
and Mg, because these metals are not 
associated with vehicular pollution. It was also 
confirmed from the enrichment factor 
discussed previously that Ca and Mg at 
various sites are mainly of crustal origin.
CONCLUSIONS
Source apportionment carried out by both 
CMB8 and PCA identified two major sources: 
vehicular and crustal dust (crustal re-suspension 
for PCA). Results of the CMB8 and uses also 
revealed the contributions of paved road dust 
and industrial pollutants to be small in both the 
coarse and fine size ranges. It has also been 
observed that the over-dominance of vehicular 
pollutants are now (2005-06) confined to fine 
particles only, while they dominated both 
coarse and fine particles during pre-CNG 
implementation era (2001).
