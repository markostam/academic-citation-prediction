This paper describes a set of alignments of 28 vertebrate genome 
sequences that is provided by the UCSC Genome Browser. The 
alignments can be viewed on the Human Genome Browser (March 
2006 assembly) at http://genome.ucsc.edu, downloaded in bulk by 
anonymous FTP from 
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/multiz28way, 
and analyzed with the Galaxy server at http://g2.bx.psu.edu. This paper 
illustrates the power of this resource for exploring vertebrate and 
mammalian evolution, using three examples. First, we present several 
vignettes involving insertions and deletions within protein-coding 
regions, including a look at some human-specific indels. Then we study 
the extent to which start codons and stop codons in the human 
sequence are conserved in other species, showing that start codons 
are in general more poorly conserved than stop codons. Finally, an 
investigation of the phylogenetic depth of conservation for several 
classes of functional elements in the human genome reveals striking 
differences in the rates and modes of decay in alignability. Each 
functional class has a distinctive period of stringent constraint, followed 
by decays that allow (regulatory regions) or reject (coding regions and 
ultraconserved elements) insertions and deletions. 
 
 
The National Human Genome Research Institute is funding a number of vertebrate 
genome sequencing projects, primarily at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the 
Human Genome Sequencing Center at the Baylor College of Medicine, and the Genome 
Sequencing Center at Washington University. Additional genome sequence data are 
being provided by other organizations, including the Sanger Centre, DOE’s Joint 
Genome Institute, and the National Institute of Genetics in Japan. (Table S1 of the 
Supplementary Materials identifies the producers of the individual genome sequences.) 
The sequences are being immediately and freely released to the public to allow scientists 
to use the genomic information in their own research. (The scientific community is 
expected to postpone publications of large-scale analyses of the data until consortia 
organized by the data producers can publish their initial large-scale analyses, in the spirit 
of the Ft. Lauderdale agreement (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd003208.html).) 
While a few sophisticated users can mine the raw sequences, many prefer to wait 
until the data have been assembled into chromosomes, annotated, and aligned to other 
sequences. The sequencing centers work closely with several groups, including the 
UCSC Browser team, Ensembl, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information, 
who maximize data availability and in some cases align the genome sequences to each 
other so as to facilitate their direct comparison. 
 Alignments of genomic sequences have long been used as guides to help locate 
certain kinds of functional non-coding regions (e.g., Hardison 2000), and have more 
recently been used for finding protein-coding genes (Siepel and Haussler 2004; Gross and 
Brent 2006) and non-coding RNA genes (Pederson et al. 2006). Indeed, the primary 
justification for much of the recent effort to sequence mammalian genomes was to more 
reliably identify functional elements via sequence alignments (Margulies et al. 2005). 
The alignments can also reveal similarities and differences between the sequences of 
humans and those of disease-model species, and thereby enhance the effectiveness of the 
model species for experiments aimed at improving human health (Rhesus Macaque 
Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2007). Moreover, the alignments provide 
critical data for determining the course of evolution and for the computational 
reconstruction of ancestral genome sequences. 
 However, producing whole-genome alignments requires expertise and 
computational resources that are not easily available within a typical research group. 
Moreover, reproducibility of published results is facilitated if the alignments used by one 
group can be utilized directly by others, providing further impetus for creating a reliable, 
comprehensive, and up-to-date set of freely available alignments. 
 To meet these needs, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group produces browsers 
for a number of species, each containing genome-wide multiple alignments with 
conservation scoring (“Conservation tracks”) in addition to other types of annotations. 
Alignments at the Human Genome Browsers are constructed using all vertebrate species 
that have their own UCSC browser, plus a number of additional mammalian species for 
which low-coverage sequence is available (Margulies et al. 2005). For instance, although 
there is currently no browser devoted to the rabbit genome, the alignments at the Human 
Genome Browser include rabbit sequences. 
 We have recently performed a major update to the Conservation track on the latest 
UCSC Human Genome Browser. The purpose of this paper is to describe the new 
alignments and to illustrate their use by exploring a few interesting biological issues. This 
paper does not provide an overall analysis of the sequence datasets themselves, which 
will be the subject of various consortium papers in preparation.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The 28-way alignment 
 
In April 2007, the UCSC Conservation track for the NCBI Build 36 (UCSC hg18) human 
genome sequence was updated from a 17-way to a 28-way vertebrate alignment (see 
Methods). The expanded conservation track now includes 11 new species and 
incorporates updated sequence assemblies for six of the old ones. Figure 1 shows the 
evolutionary relationships among the sequences that were assumed for the purpose of 
aligning them (see Methods). Table 1 provides data about the extent to which the 
individual sequences are represented in the alignment. Note that even for vertebrate 
species that are quite distant from humans and for mammals with only two-fold shotgun 
sequence coverage, over 80% of human protein-coding intervals are aligned, though the 
overall fraction of the human sequence that aligns is under 2% for some species.

Table 1.  Species-by-species information.  The “Seq. Cov.” column describes the shotgun 
sequencing average read depth except for the human and mouse sequences, which are finished. 
“Filter” indicates what sort of filtering, either syntenic, reciprocal best, or no filtering, was applied 
to the pairwise alignments with human before they were brought into the multiple alignment (see 
Methods). “Total Align” is the percentage of human bases covered by alignments with that 
species (including alignments to the ‘-‘ gap character). “Start Aligns” and “Stop Aligns” show what 
percentage of human start and stop codons align in the other species. (The coverage of start and 
stop codons is discussed in greater depth later in the paper.) “Total %ID” shows the percentage 
identity between human and the other species within aligning regions excluding gaps. The “Start 
%ID” shows what percentage of aligning human start codons are also start codons in the other 
species, and similarly the “Stop %ID” shows what percentage of aligning human stop codons are 
stop codons in the other species. The “ORF Cover” measures the percent of human ORFs 
(region between start and stop codon) that are covered by the largest ORF in the same reading 
frame in the other species. The genes used for the start and stop codons and ORFs are the 
reviewed subset of human RefSeq, 11729 genes total.

The 28 genome sequences (Table 1) form a heterogeneous mix. They include two 
finished sequences, human and mouse, with an estimated coverage of over 99% of the 
euchromatin and an error rate of 1 in 100,000 (International Human Genome Sequencing 
Consortium 2004). In addition there are sixteen high quality draft sequences based on 
whole-genome shotgun assemblies with coverage from 5.1X to 8.5X. Finally there are 
ten whole-genome shotgun assemblies with coverage roughly 2X.  In theory, according to 
the Lander-Waterman (1988) formula, a 2X assembly should include 87.5% of the bases 
in the genome, and a 5X assembly 99.4%. In practice the base inclusion is somewhat less 
due to cloning bias and related issues, and this bias is difficult to estimate precisely. 
Table 1 also shows the percentage of the human genome that aligns to the various other 
genomes. Because of coverage issues, the true total aligning portions once the genomes 
are finished will be likely be 10% to 15% above what we currently see for the 2X 
assemblies, and 1-4% above the current values for the higher coverage draft sequences. 
 
 
Application 1: Three vignettes about insertions and deletions in protein-coding 
regions 
To illustrate applications of the 28-way alignment for exploring biological issues and 
hypotheses, we look briefly at three uses of data about insertions and deletions 
(collectively called indels) in protein-coding regions. First, we test the hypothesis that 
coding indels have accumulated at a uniform rate during evolution of placental mammals. 
Second, we look for human-specific coding indels with phenotypic consequences. 
Finally, we consider the hypothesis that coding indels are more likely to have adverse 
phenotypic consequences if the affected amino acids are well conserved over 
evolutionary time. These brief explorations illustrate the utility of the 28-way alignment 
for addressing a wide range of interesting questions. 
 
Do coding indels accumulate at a uniform rate? 
Coding indels have been used for inferring phylogenetic relationships among 
species. For instance, Poux et al. (2002) identified a 6-bp deletion near the start of the 
prion protein gene, PRNP. The indel supports the claim that humans are more closely 
related to mice (and other glires) than to dogs (and other laurasiatherians). In brief, the 
reasoning is that the indel can be explained as resulting from a single evolutionary event 
if and only if primates and glires form a monophyletic clade; any other tree topology 
requires the unlikely situation that two or more evolutionary events combined to appear 
like a single event. Fig. 2 shows this region of the 28-way alignment. Another use of 
coding indels to help understand the course of mammalian evolution is discussed by 
Murphy et al. (2007), supporting the assertion that elephants and armadillos separated 
from the human lineage in the same speciation event. The relationship between the 
alignments at the UCSC Browser and this use of coding indels has bidirectional synergy. 
Determination of the most likely history of mammalian evolution is needed to produce 
the most appropriate multiple alignments, and conversely, the pairwise and multiple 
alignments available at UCSC provide an excellent substrate for studying the 
mechanisms and history of vertebrate evolution. 
 
Figure 2. A 6-bp deletion near the start of PRNP. Species in the 28-way alignment lacking 
data for this region are not shown. This alignment can be seen in the current (hg18) UCSC 
Genome Browser at chr20:4,627,867-4,627,880. See Supplementary Figure S2 for an amino-acid 
alignment of the deletion involving many more species. 
 
Given that coding indels provide evidence concerning the topology (shape) of the 
phylogenetic tree, are they introduced at such a uniform rate that they can be used to 
estimate the time separating speciation events? To address this issue, we asked if 
accelerations or decelerations in the rate of insertions/deletions within protein-coding 
regions could be detected along certain branches of the phylogenetic tree. We started by 
searching the 28-way alignment for positions within annotated coding exons where 
humans have an insertion or deletion relative to both elephant and opossum, i.e., indels 
that appear to have been created during placental evolution along the human lineage. 
(The search used custom-built software; see Conclusions, below.) For each such indel 
and for each of the 16 other placental mammalian sequences in the alignment, we 
determined whether the species agrees with human, with elephant, or with neither. 
Finally, we retained the indels that could be unambiguously assigned to a currently 
sampled branch of the human lineage (relative to the phylogenetic tree that we used). For 
example, the deletion in Fig. 2 would be assigned to the branch from the human-dog 
ancestor to the human-mouse ancestor (except that it fails a requirement for amount of 
flanking coding sequence imposed by our program). This process assigned 209 indels as 
shown in Fig. 3. 
 
 
Figure 3. Number of inferred coding indels and number per million years on the placental 
branches leading to human. Estimated time elapsed on each branch is taken from Murphy et al. 
(2007). 
 
We tested the hypothesis that coding indels were fixed in the human lineage at a 
uniform rate over time.  A parametric bootstrap test showed that the observed indel 
frequencies differ significantly (p < 10-3) from the hypothesis of uniform distribution. 
Specifically, the indels detected by our procedure seem to have occurred at a rate of about 
four per million years in early placental evolution, but at less than two per million years 
in recent times. 
 
 
Human-specific protein indels 
Among the assignments of coding indels to tree branches, described above, we 
identified 11 indels that arose after human-chimp divergence (Table 2). Much additional 
work is required before one can have any confidence that a particular mutation is related 
to an observable human trait; here we illustrate some appropriate kinds of bioinformatic 
analyses for two of these genes, SULF1 and GFM2. Laboratory or clinical evidence is 
required to make a convincing case for any phenotypic consequences of an indel from 
this list.

Table 2. 11 human-specific coding indels observed in the 28-way alignment. Locations are in 
human genome assembly hg18. 
 
SULF1 has a human-specific 3 bp insertion in exon 11. The insertion adds a GAA 
codon (E, in the amino acid sequence) to a run of four identical codons. The repetitive 
nature of this region immediately suggests a mechanism for expansion and/or contraction 
by replication slippage, which makes the change in the human protein perhaps seem 
unremarkable. The insertion appears to be fixed in humans (i.e., not polymorphic). No 
reliable information is available about the three-dimensional structure of this part of the 
protein sequence, and we could find no published association of genetic disease with 
exon 11. 
On the other hand, conservation of the sequence around the insertion site is 
extremely high (Fig. 4). Moreover, conservation of the four E’s and the surrounding 
sequence was also observed in orangutan, marmoset, tarsier, squirrel, microbat, dolphin, 
pig, sloth, hyrax, and wallaby, according to sequences we located by searching public 
databases. For some reason, nature has retained the pattern of precisely four successive 
E’s (except for a loss of one E in the lizard sequence) over a total of two billion years of 
evolution along the various lineages. This evidence that the change was heavily resisted 
over evolutionary time, despite existence of a putative mechanism that could easily make 
the change (replication slippage), raises the question of whether the extra amino acid in 
humans is beneficial or deleterious. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Extreme conservation of the region around the 3-bp insertion in human SULF1. The 
symbol “-” indicates that there is no base in the aligning species that aligns to this location. 
Placement of the gap at the first human E results from tie-breaking rules in the alignment 
software. The second gap in the lizard sequence was positioned using nucleotide content of 
codons. hg18.chr8:70,698,769-70,698,840. 
 
A 6-bp insertion in human GFM2 illustrates other aspects of the computational 
analysis of human-specific coding indels identified in the 28-way alignment. In this case, 
the region around the indel is not particularly well conserved. Indeed, the insertion 
appears to be found in only some humans (Fig. 5), i.e., some of the available human 
sequence data for this gene lack the extra six bp. We have some information about the 
three-dimensional conformation of this region of the GFM2 product, based on the known 
structure of a protein (PDB entry 2bm0) with 42% identity. This model of the protein 
structure does not suggest that the insertion site is constrained by secondary or tertiary 
structural interactions that would make the sequence change difficult to accommodate.  
(See supplementary materials.) That is, the structural model does not suggest that there is 
likely to be any phenotypic consequence for humans.

species that aligns to this location, and “=” indicates that at this location in the aligning species 
there is a sequence of bases of such different length and/or sequence composition that it cannot 
be reliably aligned. Sequence for this interval is currently not available for shrew or tenrec. 
chr5:74,057,590-74,057,630. 
 
 
Have positions in disease-associated deletions resisedt substitution over evolutionary 
time? 
 
The number of known amino-acid differences in the human population is rapidly 
increasing. There is much interest in developing computational tools to help predict 
which of these changes might have implications for human health, as summarized by Ng 
and Henikoff (2006). One type of clue that has been successfully employed comes from 
interspecies conservation. In particular, it is known that human replacement mutations 
resulting in disease are over-abundant at amino acid positions that are most conserved 
throughout the long-term history of metazoans (Subramanian and Kumar 2006, and 
references cited therein). 
One way to bring indels into the picture is to ask if disease-associated deletions in 
the human population tend to involve highly conserved amino acids. Our discussion 
differs somewhat from that of Subramanian and Kumar (2006) by focusing exclusively 
on disease-associated indels and by considering data from more species. We employed 
the data on disease-associated human variants that is available at the Locus Variants track 
at the UCSC Human Genome Browser. In particular, we looked at the gene for PAH 
(phenylalanine hydroxylase); PAH deficiency causes PKU, the most common inborn 
error of amino acid metabolism in Caucasians. To keep everything simple, our measure 
of (lack of) conservation at each position was the number of distinct amino acids in that 
column of the 28-way alignment. 
 The distribution of these conservation scores at positions where a frame-
preserving indel (i.e. of length divisible by 3) is annotated as disease-associated was not 
strikingly different from the scores’ distribution at all positions of PAH, so this small 
experiment failed to support our hypothesis. (The p-value for the two-tailed permutation 
test based on 1000 iterations was ~0.69.) However, the number of annotated PAH indels 
is very small, so the result is heavily affected by a putative disease-associated deletion 
where the amino acid has low conservation, shown in Fig. 6. 
An obvious next step in pursuing this line of investigation would be to follow 
links from the Browser to the publication that is said to claim that the deletion is 
associated with PKU (namely, Perez et al. 1997), to evaluate the strength of the evidence 
that the deletion is indeed causative. In any case, the Browser, with its Locus Variants 
track, represents a valuable resource for this kind of study. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. A segment of the gene for PAH, showing positions of indels that are reported to be 
associated with the disease PKU. The CCT deletion (AAG on the strand shown) removes an 
amino acid whose column has 6 distinct letters, and in that sense is not well conserved. The 
nucleotide symbol “N” represents an unsequenced base,  “-” indicates that there is no base in the 
aligning species that aligns to this location, and “=” indicates that at this location in the aligning 
species there is a sequence of bases of such different length and/or sequence composition that it 
cannot be reliably aligned. The two conservation tracks indicate that the deleted position is not 
well conserved among all vertebrates, but fairly well conserved within placental mammals.

Application 2: Conservation of start and stop codons 
 
In general, as one would expect, the sequence within human coding regions is much more 
likely to align, and when aligning much more likely to be identical to other species, than 
the human genome overall. This becomes more and more apparent the more distantly 
related the other organism is to human. While the overall amount of the coding region 
that aligns to human typically remains above 80% even in fish, the stop and particularly 
the start codons drift away at a much faster rate (Table 1). By the time we reach zebrafish 
only 40.6% of start codons and 58.8% of stop codons align. The trend of more stop than 
start codons aligning is present in every sequence except for the one other finished 
sequence, mouse, where 97.7% of starts and 96.8% of stops align (p-value for one-tailed 
test for proportions < 10-3). This level of drift certainly makes the job of identifying 
precise gene boundaries based on comparative genomics data more difficult. 
The greater rate of start codon drift compared to stop codon drift is puzzling.  We 
advanced three hypotheses to explain this. Since the one finished sequence, mouse, was 
an exception to this rule, we hypothesized that it might be due to the CpG islands that are 
common near gene starts being more difficult to sequence.  If we look at genes that don’t 
start in a CpG island, indeed there is no statistically significant difference between the 
start and stop codon drift within placental mammals (p-value for the two-tailed test for 
proportions is 0.13). However at further evolutionary distances the difference in drift is 
actually more pronounced in genes lacking CpG islands. For instance, for Tetraodon the 
difference between stop and start codon conservation is 79.30% - 50.79% = 28.41% for 
genes with a CpG island and 78.82% - 42.64% = 36.18% for those without (See Table 3).  
Another hypothesis was that selection at the start codon might be more relaxed in 
genes with multiple promoters, and this could account for some of the difference between 
the start and stop codon drift. However the difference in drift among genes with known 
alternative promoters is actually slightly less than with other genes. For instance, the 
average difference for placental mammals was 95.00% - 94.73% = 0.27% for genes with 
alternate promoters, and 95.06% - 92.41% = 2.65% for other genes. The third hypothesis 
was that since the initial coding exon is often small, particularly at large evolutionary 
distances, our programs might not have enough surrounding conserved sequence to 
reliably align the region around the start codon. We did find that between humans and 
species more distant than placental mammals there is a large increase in alignability of 
start codons that are part of exons with at least 100 coding bases (p-value < 10-3), though 
still some disparity remained with 84% of stop codons but only 63% of start codons 
aligning.  See Table 3 for additional details on these experiments. 
Overall a bias against CpG islands in the draft sequence combined with difficulty 
in aligning small initial coding exons does explain a great deal of the observed 
unalignability of start codons compared to stop codons.  Another hypothesis, which is 
harder to test, is that the start of a protein, since it is very often trimmed by proteases, is 
subject to less selective pressure than protein ends. Related to this, part of the reason that 
the smaller initial coding exons are particularly vulnerable to this drift may be that there 
is less selection against deletion of the entire exon when the protein coding portion of it is 
small.  
Regardless of the actual cause of the drift, in practical terms it is something that 
investigators building gene models based on an analysis of multiple genomic alignments 
need to be well aware of, as was noted in regards to start codons based on CAGE tag data 
(Frith et al. 2006).  The suggests that the total branch length provided by several placental 
species may be superior for gene prediction to the branch length provided by a single 
non-placental, and that finishing additional placental genomes may be worthwhile.

(in human) there are at least 100 coding bases in the exon containing the start codon. The Small

Application 3: Phylogenetic extent of alignment (alignability) of functional regions 
 A major observation of the recent paper (Mikkelsen et al. 2007) on the genome 
sequence of Monodelphis domestica (short-tailed opossum) is that conservation in non-
coding regions is much more subject to evolutionary turnover than in protein-coding 
regions. More specifically, conservation turnover refers to cases where an interval of 
human sequence shows signs of purifying selection when compared with some species 
but not with others. The 28-way alignment provides an ideal resource for investigating 
conservation turnover in greater depth, as we now show. 
Effective use of comparative genomics to find and better understand functional 
regions of genomes remains a challenge. Most coding exons show a strong signature of 
evolutionary constraint, but others are under positive selection for adaptive changes. A 
small fraction of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are deeply conserved from humans to 
fish (Woolfe et al. 2005), but others are present only in particular clades (Valverde-
Garduno et al. 2004; King et al. 2007). The new multiple alignment provides the 
opportunity to examine the phylogenetic depth of conservation of different functional 
classes at a higher resolution, because of the larger number of species included. In this 
study, we examined 251,000 coding exons of RefSeq genes (Pruitt and Maglott 2001), 
481 ultraconserved elements (UCEs, Bejerano et al. 2004), and 94,000 predicted 
regulatory regions, which we call PRPs, characterized by both clusters of conserved 
transcription factor binding sites (PReMods, Blanchette et al. 2006) and a strong signal 
for alignment patterns that discriminate between regulatory regions and neutral DNA 
(high RP, Taylor et al. 2006) (See Methods). We also included a collection of 3900 
putative transcriptional regulatory regions (pTRRs) discovered by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to high density microarray chips (ChIP-
chip experiments) from the ENCODE pilot project (King et al. 2007; The ENCODE 
Project Consortium 2007). The latter dataset is composed of functional regions identified 
by methods that don’t depend on sequences or their alignments.  
Determining the range of comparison species in which homologs of a DNA 
sequence are present is fundamental to studying its evolution. We define the alignability 
of a particular DNA segment (e.g. in human) as the fraction of that align with a 
designated comparison species. In the current study, the 28-way alignment is the basis for 
computing alignability (see Methods). In Figure 7.C, the alignability of the human 
functional classes with each comparison species is plotted as a function of phylogenetic 
distance estimated by substitutions per four-fold degenerate (4D) site in coding regions. 
The 4D sites were the ones established by detailed examination of protein-coding 
segments in ENCODE regions (Harrow et al. 2006; The ENCODE Project Consortium 
2007). The substitutions per 4D site were determined using the REV model (Yang 1997). 
A set of tools have been added to the Galaxy workspace (Blankenberg et al. 2007) to 
facilitate similar analyses of other datasets and other phylogenetic ranges. 
In order to establish a baseline for evaluation of the alignability of various feature 
sets, we examined the alignability of the nonrepetitive, noncoding portion of the human 
genome, which we will refer to as the background. Loss of alignability is likely to be 
driven by deletions in the lineage to the comparison species and insertions in the human 
lineage, with some contribution from substitutions. If these events occur independently, 
then the alignability should decay exponentially with increasing phylogenetic distance 
(Kimura 1969). This is indeed observed for the background alignability, especially for 
comparisons outside primates (Fig. 7.C and Table S4 in Supplementary Material).  
This predictable decline of the background alignability with phylogenetic distance 
provides a basis for comparison of the decay (if any) in alignability of functional regions. 
We examined several feature sets to determine the range of comparison species over 
which high alignability is maintained, the mode and rate of decay, the fraction of 
intervals that continue to align at a given distance, and the quality of alignments, and 
found striking differences.  
Almost all coding exons align in all placental mammals, followed by a decay that 
is much slower than that of the background  (Fig. 7.B and C). Almost all UCEs align with 
species as distant as chicken, but a decline is seen with more distant species (Fig. 7.B and 
C). Indeed, alignability of UCEs appears to decay as a function of the square of the 
phylogenetic distance. The decay equation (Supplementary Material) predicts a 
substantial loss of recognizable UCEs at distances of 2.5 to 3 substitutions per site, which 
is consistent with the failure to detect UCEs outside vertebrates (Bejerano et al. 2004). 
The 60-70% of UCEs conserved between humans and fish are distinct from the ones 
limited to mammals (see Supplementary Materials). The pan-vertebrate UCEs are further 
from genes on average than are the pan-mammalian ones, reminiscent of the jungles of 
noncoding conserved sequences observed in human-chicken comparisons (Hillier et al. 
2004). As expected, the deeply conserved UCEs are near genes enriched in GO 
categories for transcription factors and developmental regulatory genes (Woolfe et al. 
2005). Both the coding exons and UCEs maintain a high conservation level in all 
comparisons, shown by the high values in the distributions of alignment scores per 
column (Fig. 7.A). 
The predicted cis-regulatory modules (PReMods with high regulatory potential, or 
PRPs) show substantially elevated alignability above that of the background DNA (Fig. 
7.B and C). The PRPs were selected at least in part by their ability to align among 
mammalian species, and as expected, virtually all of them align to other eutherian 
species. In addition, a substantial fraction align to marsupials and monotremes. The 
alignability for comparisons outside primates decays exponentially, but substantially 
more slowly than the background. The distributions of conservation-level scores are 
considerably higher than the background but substantially less than those for coding 
exons (Fig. 7.A).  Similar results are obtained for the decay in alignability of a small set 
of 93 curated known regulatory regions (Elnitski et al. 2003) (data not shown). 
Another set of genomic regions (pTRRs), which is implicated in transcriptional 
regulation by ChIP-chip biochemical analyses, shows a different pattern. The loss of 
alignability with phylogenetic distance for the ENCODE pTRRs is more rapid than the 
decay seen for PRPs (Fig. 7.C). The shape of the decay curve is similar to that of the 
background, but shifted to the right. The rightward shift indicates a slower decay, 
implying that the pTRRs are constrained; i.e. as a class they are eroding more slowly than 
the background. This is also seen in the higher fraction of the pTRR intervals that pass an 
alignability threshold compared to that of the background (Fig. 7.B). Interestingly, the 
similarity level of the alignments in the pTRR intervals overlaps substantially with that of 
the background, whereas the alignments of UCEs and coding exons have strikingly 
higher scores (Fig. 7.A). Results similar to those for pTRRs are obtained for a genome-
wide set of 13,000 segments occupied by the transcription factor CTCF (Kim et al. 2007) 
(data not shown). 
While the pTRRs as a class do have a higher alignability than the background for 
many comparisons, the number of pTRRs that are conserved drops dramatically between 
eutherian mammals (horse, dog, cow, and rodents) and the marsupial opossum (Fig. 7.B). 
This shows that 70% of pTRRs are conserved within eutherian mammals, while 70% are 
not conserved outside of eutherians. Smaller fractions are conserved in more distant 
comparisons. The pTRRs conserved out to chicken and fish are likely to have been under 
constraint over this phylogenetic span. Given the estimates for rates of neutral 
substitutions, sequences that still align between human and chicken, and more distant 
species, are all likely to be under constraint (Hillier et al. 2004). 
This study illustrates the range and complexity of the relationships between the 
functionality of genomic sequences and their phylogenetic extent of alignability. The 
decays of alignability for some strongly constrained functional classes differ markedly 
from that of the genome background. Coding exons are largely conserved through 
eutherians, after which they decay much more slowly than the background. Almost all 
UCEs are conserved in amniotes, after which their alignability decays more rapidly than 
do coding exons. Alignability of functional classes associated with gene regulation 
presents exponential decay curves, but with lag times and slopes characteristic of the 
feature sets and distinctly different from the background. The alignability of PRPs begins 
to decline outside most eutherians whereas the alignability of pTRRs and CTCF binding 
sites begins to decay outside the available primates. This can be interpreted as stringent 
selection being exerted over different phylogenetic spans for the distinct types of 
regulatory regions, followed by decay in sequence similarity. The mode of decay in 
alignability is exponential both for the features associated with regulation and for the 
background. This could mean that the processes of sequence change are similar, with 
deletions and insertions allowed as in the background genome (albeit at a slower rate), 
whereas these events tend to be rejected in coding exons and UCEs.

center line of each box is the median, the box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles, and the

connecting human to the comparison species. The common name for each comparison species 
is given below the barplots in B and is connected to the phylogenetic distance in C by dotted 
lines. The data are best fit by two decay curves, one for primates with a slow rate of change and 
the other for horse to medaka. The curves shown are the fits to the data points from horse to 
medaka. (Statistics and coefficients for these fits are in Table S4 in the Supplementary Material.) 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
To use alignments of placental-mammal genome sequences to identify small intervals 
(say, the size of a transcription-factor binding site) that are under strong negative 
selection, one needs sequence data from perhaps 40 well-chosen species (Eddy 2005; 
Margulies et al. 2005). Of course, one could obtain an equivalent total phylogenetic 
branch length by using a smaller number of more distant species, but as shown in Fig. 7, 
many functional sites will then be lost to conservation turnover. The 28-way alignment 
comes the closest to date to attaining this 40-species goal.  Here we illustrate the use of 
those alignments to explore hypotheses about vertebrate evolution. The individual results 
are interesting in their own right and worthy of further study, but they are merely a 
sampling of what we and others will discover with those alignments. 
 Some of the phenomena described here can be directly observed in the UCSC 
Browser. Others require the use of tools such as the UCSC Table Browser (Karolchik et 
al. 2004) or the Galaxy server (Giardine et al. 2005; Blankenberg et al. 2007) to help 
identify genome-wide trends. The most generally applicable approach is to write special 
purpose programs to analyze the alignments. For instance, C-language programs used for 
analyzing the rate of coding indels can be downloaded from: 
  http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/publications/ 
Other programs for manipulating the alignments are mentioned in the Methods section.  
 The analyses presented here were necessarily quite brief, and in each case it 
would be possible to strengthen the analysis by using more complex approaches. For 
instance, our modeling of coding indels was quite simplistic, and much more 
sophisticated methods (e.g., Diallo et al. 2007) could be applied. Similarly, we frequently 
assumed that regions aligned to a functional human gene are themselves functional genes 
in the other species, though some of them may have become inactive pseudo-genes. To 
help ameliorate the (presumed minor) effects of such cases, one could incorporate gene-
model data from the other species, such as that available from Ensembl (Hubbard et al. 
2007). 
While in practice we use the 28-way alignment to explore many issues, there are 
times when other alignments might be more appropriate. For instance, the 28-way 
alignment is based on a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) that is not universally accepted (e.g., 
see Wible et al. 2007). While this may not affect most conclusions, there are cases, such 
as the use of the alignment to support or reject certain evolutionary hypotheses, where the 
tree matters (Kumar and Filipski 2007). In such cases it might be better to use a set of 
pairwise alignments that are agnostic about phylogetic hypotheses (e.g., Rosenbloom et 
al. 2007). Also, our alignments are made with programs that implement only one 
approach and that use particular settings of a large number of thresholds and other 
parameters; others may prefer to use different software, such as the tools discussed by 
Margulies et al. (2007). In any case, users need to remain aware that there are genomic 
regions in which the 28-way alignment, or indeed an alignment computed by any means, 
is unreliable because evolutionary changes have saturated the sequences (Prakash and 
Tompa 2007). 
A general theme running through our observations, and one that continues to 
enthrall many investigators, is to identify the best ways to use multi-species alignments to 
help predict the locations of functional genomic elements. In particular, are these 
elements more frequently revealed by reduced levels of substitutions, by particular 
patterns of substitutions, by reduced levels of small insertions and deletions, or by a 
reduced level of complete loss? Data summarized in Figure 7 can be interpreted as 
suggesting that resistance to complete loss is sometimes more informative than low 
substitution rates. Another, very preliminary, study reported here raises the question of 
whether substitution frequency can be used to predict whether deletion of an amino acid 
might cause human disease. Whole-genome alignments provide a valuable resource for 
investigating these and many other fascinating issues.  
 
METHODS 
 
Phylogenetic tree and branch lengths (Figure 1). We used the tree topology that seemed 
in best agreement with our interpretation of the published literature. Branch lengths, 
which are used for quantifying sequence conservation (see below) but not for computing 
the alignments, were computed by phyloFit as described below. 
 
Alignments. Pairwise alignments with the human genome were generated for each species 
(blastz, Schwartz et. al. 2003) from repeat-masked genomic sequence (RepeatMasker, by 
A. Smit & R. Hubley  or WindowMasker, by Morgulis et al.), with lineage-specific 
repeats removed prior to realignment, then reinserted. The pairwise alignment coverage 
for all species is listed in Table 1. Pairwise alignments were then linked into chains using 
a dynamic programming algorithm that finds maximally scoring chains of gapless 
subsections of the alignments organized in a kd-tree (axtChain,  Kent et al. 2003). The 
scoring matrix and parameters for pairwise alignment and chaining were tuned for each 
species based on its phylogenetic distance from the reference. High-scoring chains were 
then placed along the genome, with gaps filled by lower-scoring chains (axtNet, by J. 
Kent), to produce an alignment net. Filtering of the component pairwise alignments was 
performed to reduce paralogs, pseudogenes, and suspect alignments from the 2X species. 
The alignments of high-quality mammalian sequences (placental and marsupial) were 
filtered based on synteny, while those for 2X mammalian genomes were filtered to retain 
only alignments that were best quality in both species (“reciprocal best”). The resulting 
best-in-genome pairwise alignments were progressively aligned following the tree 
topology of Figure 1, using the multiz program (Blanchette et al. 2004). Alignments were 
post-processed to add annotations for alignment gaps and genomic breaks, indications of 
base quality in the component sequences (see Supplement), and information that permits 
prediction of amino-acid sequences in all species.  
 Conservation scoring was performed using the phastCons package (Siepel et al. 
2005), which computes conservation based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov 
model (HMM). These measurements rely on a tree model containing the tree topology, 
branch lengths representing evolutionary distance at neutrally evolving sites, the 
background distribution of nucleotides, and a substitution rate matrix. The vertebrate tree 
model for this track was generated using the phyloFit program from the phastCons 
package (REV model, EM algorithm, medium precision) using multiple alignments of 4-
fold degenerate sites extracted from the 28way alignment (msa_view). The 4d sites were 
derived from the October 2005 Gencode Reference Gene set (Harrow et al. 2006), which 
was filtered to select single-coverage long transcripts. A second tree model, including 
only placental mammals, was used to generate the placental mammal conservation 
scoring. The phastCons parameters were tuned to produce 5% conserved elements in the 
human genome for the vertebrate conservation measurement; this parameter set 
(expected-length=45, target-coverage=.3, rho=.31) was then used to generate the 
placental mammal conservation scoring. 
The phastCons program computes conservation scores based on a phylo-HMM, a 
type of probabilistic model that describes both the process of DNA substitution at each 
site in a genome and the way this process changes from one site to the next (Felsenstein 
and Churchill 1996, Yang 1995, Siepel and Haussler 2005). PhastCons uses a two-state 
phylo-HMM, with a state for conserved regions and a state for non-conserved regions. 
The value plotted at each site is the posterior probability that the corresponding alignment 
column was “generated” by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM. These scores reflect 
the phylogeny (including branch lengths) of the species in question, a continuous-time 
Markov model of the nucleotide substitution process, and a tendency for conservation 
levels to be autocorrelated along the genome (i.e., to be similar at adjacent sites). Unlike 
many conservation-scoring programs, note that phastCons does not rely on a sliding 
window of fixed size; therefore, short highly-conserved regions and long moderately 
conserved regions can both obtain high scores. More information about phastCons can be 
found in Siepel et al. 2005. 
PhastCons currently treats alignment gaps as missing data, which sometimes has 
the effect of producing undesirably high conservation scores in gappy regions of the 
alignment. We are looking at several possible ways of improving the handling of 
alignment gaps. 
 
Extraction and analysis of MAF blocks. Local portions of the 28-way alignment are 
stored as so-called MAF blocks (MAF = Multiple Alignment Format). In Galaxy, MAF-
block extraction is implemented using an on-disk variation of the positional binning 
scheme described in Kent et al. (2002) to allow fast extraction of alignment blocks 
overlapping specific regions of the human sequence. Due to the size of these alignments 
compression is essential; here we used LZO compression (http://www.lzop.org/). As a 
result of compression, it is no longer possible to seek directly to a particular alignment 
block in these files. However, because the LZO format compresses the data in 
independent chunks, accessing a particular alignment block only requires decompressing 
the containing chunk(s) of compressed data (i.e. semi-random access). This is a 
substantial benefit over the common GZIP format, for example, which requires 
decompressing all preceding data to access a particular location. We have implemented 
an indexing scheme for (1) identifying the locations of all MAF blocks that overlap a 
particular interval in some aligned species and (2) mapping those locations to their 
containing chunks of compressed data. Combined, these methods make working with 
alignments of this scale substantially easier. Command-line programs and Python 
modules for generating and using these indexes are available as part of the “bx-python” 
package (http://bx-python.trac.bx.psu.edu/). 
 
PRPs 
 
PRPs are a set of predicted cis-regulatory modules that have both the properties of (1) 
clusters of conserved transcription factor binding sites (PReMods, Blanchette et al. 2006) 
and (2) high regulatory potential (high RP intervals, Taylor et al. 2006). PRP is a brief 
name denoting the combination of PReMod and RP. 
The set of 118,402 PReMods (human genome assembly hg17) was collected from 
the web server discussed in Blanchette et al. (2006). The RP scores were determined for a 
7-way alignment of human (hg17), chimpanzee (panTro2), macaque (rheMac2), mouse 
(mm8), rat (rn4), dog (canFam2), and cow (bosTau2). Human DNA intervals with an RP 
score of at least 0.05 for at least 200 bp (i.e. the minimum score never goes below 0.05) 
were selected to obtain 314,020 high-RP intervals. 
The next series of operations was conducted using on-line tools in Galaxy. 
KnownGenes exons obtained from the UCSC Table Browser (extended 15 bp on each 
side) were subtracted from the high RP intervals, and intervals shorter than 200 bp were 
removed to obtain a total of 282,639 nonexonic high-RP intervals. These were intersected 
with the PReMods, requiring an overlap of at least 10 bp, to produce 106,383 pieces 
present in both sets. Intervals within 100 bp of each other were then merged, the merged 
intervals were combined with the other intervals from the intersection, and those shorter 
than 50 bp were removed. This series of operations produced a set of 92,269 PRPs. Their 
average length is 350 bp, ranging from 50 bp to 3,793 bp. 
The ENCODE regions cover 1% of the human genome, and have been examined 
experimentally  for chromatin alterations, occupancy by a set of transcription factors, and 
transcription start sites (The ENCODE Project Consortium 2007; Margulies et al. 2007). 
Examination of the 1,389 PRPs that lie within ENCODE regions supports the hypothesis 
that the PRPs are good predictors of regulatory function. About half are within 100 bp of 
an interval associated with transcriptional regulation (using the ENCODE pilot phase 
data available now at the UCSC web site), which is about a two-fold enrichment over the 
bulk DNA in the ENCODE regions. In some well-studied ENCODE regions, the support 
level for PRPs reaches 100%.  
 
Alignability 
 
The alignability of an interval in the human sequence with another species is the 
proportion of bases in that interval that are covered by any local pairwise alignment with 
the other species. Positions in the human interval are conservatively classified as aligned, 
not aligned, or potentially missing using the local alignments and alignment gap 
annotation, with the goal of excluding from analysis all positions in the human sequence 
that are not aligned due to missing data in the other species sequence. Specifically, (1) all 
positions covered by a local alignment are marked aligned, (2) if there is no local 
alignment or gap annotation covering the position, or the gap annotation indicates 
contiguity across the position but with missing data in the other species sequence, the 
position is marked potentially missing, and (3) if there is no local alignment but the gap 
annotation indicates contiguity in both species, the position is marked not aligned. 
Alignability is then the number of aligned positions divided by the number of aligned 
plus not aligned positions. For ten of the 28 species, the alignability measures were 
markedly different from those seen for other species at a similar distance from human. 
This is likely a result of incomplete coverage, since all had about 2X coverage or less. 
The program used to compute alignability, “maf_interval_alignability.py”, is available as 
part of the “bx-python” package (http://bx-python.trac.bx.psu.edu/).
