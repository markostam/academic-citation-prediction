ABSTRACT
One way to build larger, more comprehensive phylogenies is to combine the vast amount of phylogenetic
information already available. We review the two main strategies for accomplishing this (combining raw
data versus combining trees), but employ a relatively new variant of the latter : supertree construction. The
utility of one supertree technique, matrix representation using parsimony analysis (MRP), is demonstrated
by deriving a complete phylogeny for all 271 extant species of the Carnivora from 177 literature sources.
Beyond providing a ‘consensus ’ estimate of carnivore phylogeny, the tree also indicates taxa for which the
relationships remain controversial (e.g. the red panda; within canids, felids, and hyaenids) or have not been
studied in any great detail (e.g. herpestids, viverrids, and intrageneric relationships in the procyonids). Times
of divergence throughout the tree were also estimated from 74 literature sources based on both fossil and
molecular data. We use the phylogeny to show that some lineages within the Mustelinae and Canidae
contain significantly more species than expected for their age, illustrating the tree’s utility for studies of
macroevolution. It will also provide a useful foundation for comparative and conservational studies involving
the carnivores.
Key words : Carnivora, character congruence, taxonomic congruence, supertree, matrix representation,
parsimony, divergence times, fossil dates, molecular clock, macroevolution.

I. INTRODUCTION
The benefits of a complete phylogeny for a given
taxon (beyond the systematic ones) are clear.
Phylogenies underpin comparative biology (Felsen-
stein, 1985b ; Harvey et al., 1996), and trees that are
well-resolved, complete, and include estimates of
divergence dates allow more powerful tests of a wider
range of hypotheses (Harvey & Pagel, 1991). In
addition to facilitating general studies of adaptation,
complete phylogenies are critical for testing macro-
evolutionary hypotheses (Purvis, 1996; Mooers &
Heard, 1997). For instance, have rates of diversi-
fication varied over time or among lineages? Are
there any recurring correlates of diversity (e.g. key
innovations, environmental or ecological factors,
biogeographic events)? Finally, complete phylo-
genies may have implications for conservation efforts
(Humphries, Williams & Vane-Wright, 1995;
Va! zquez & Gittleman, 1998).
Attempts to generate complete phylogenies from
primary data face two size-related limitations : (1)
obtaining sufficient data that are informative for all
sets of relationships spanning the history of the group
in question and (2) the inability of current computer
algorithms to find optimal trees for more than
approximately 20 taxa (Swofford, 1993). The first
limitation is perhaps the more serious. Although
optimal solutions cannot be guaranteed for analyses
with large numbers of taxa, heuristic search
algorithms appear to be remarkably powerful
(Swofford, 1993), particularly when prefaced by the
combination of compartmentalization (Mishler,
1994) whereby large data sets are broken down into
more manageable nested subsets, and parsimony
jackknifing (Farris et al., 1996), which is a fast
procedure for detecting well-supported clades.
Despite the recent explosion in phylogenetic
studies, the uneven distribution of research effort
across taxa and of the resulting phylogenetic in-
formation into many individual studies means that
homologous data (e.g. the same gene sequences or
morphological characters) for all members of a
group often do not exist. Furthermore, when such
data exist, they frequently cannot resolve relation-
ships throughout the tree, particularly for groups
with long evolutionary histories. One solution is a
coordinated effort to fill in the missing information.
A simpler and more cost-effective solution might be
to combine the vast amount of phylogenetic in-
formation that already exists, and this is the strategy
we employ herein for the carnivores.
The mammalian order Carnivora is a diverse
collection of 271 extant species (following
Wozencraft, 1993) found on every continent and
occupying habitats ranging from oceans to rainforest
and deserts. Carnivores range in body size over four
orders of magnitude – more than any other mam-
malian order – and are also notably diverse in their
physiology, social structure, and, despite their
ordinal name, their feeding ecology. Furthermore,
there are marked differences in the current species
richness among high-level taxa (e.g. there are 65
mustelids and only four hyaenids).
Recent comparative studies of adaptation in the
Carnivora include the evolution of life histories
(e.g. Gittleman, 1994a), colour patterns (e.g.
Ortolani & Caro, 1996), body, brain, and skull size
(e.g. Gittleman, 1994b ; Gittleman & Van Valken-
burgh, 1997), home-range size (e.g. Garland et al.,
1993), energetics and physiology (e.g. Lee, Majluf &
Gordon, 1991; McNab, 1995), and social structure
(e.g. Creel & Macdonald, 1995; Geffen et al., 1996).
Yet, despite its utility for studying carnivore evolu-
tion, no complete species-level phylogeny has ever
been assembled for this diverse and varied order. All
the above studies were limited by having only a
partial or poorly resolved phylogeny of the carni-
vores available that included only a number of key
taxa (rarely more than 30) spread throughout the
order (e.g. Wayne et al., 1989a ; Garland et al., 1993;
Wyss & Flynn, 1993; Vrana et al., 1994; Ledje &
Arnason, 1996).
We initially introduce methods of combining
phylogenetic information, focusing particularly on
constructing a phylogenetic supertree (Sanderson,
145Carnivoran phylogeny
Purvis & Henze, 1998) by matrix representation
with parsimony analysis (MRP; Baum, 1992;
Ragan, 1992). We then illustrate the utility of MRP
for building larger, more comprehensive phylogenies
by deriving the first complete species-level phylogeny
of extant carnivores based on a thorough survey of
the systematic literature from the past 25 years. We
also date the nodes in the resulting cladogram as
fully as possible, following methods in Purvis
(1995a). The carnivore ‘ supertree ’ will facilitate
tests of comparative hypotheses as we demonstrate
with some preliminary macroevolutionary analyses.
We stress, however, that our tree is not intended to
be the final word in carnivoran phylogeny, but is
intended more to provide a working hypothesis, to
provoke alternative hypotheses, and to direct more
systematic attention to groups that have so far
received little or none.
II. COMBINING PHYLOGENETIC
INFORMATION
As mentioned above, existing information can be
reexamined to provide more complete estimates of
phylogeny. Historically, two approaches have domi-
nated, both of which were initially devised to assess
the degree of congruence between independent data
sets. ‘Character congruence’ (sensu Kluge, 1989)
operates by combining and re-analysing the raw
(primary) data to derive the most consistent, unified
statement regarding relationships among a set of
taxa (Swofford, 1991). With ‘ taxonomic congru-
ence’ (sensu Mickevich, 1978), the data sets are
analysed individually and the resultant trees are
combined using consensus techniques to indicate
those clades supported by the most independent lines
of evidence (Swofford, 1991). We discuss the
advantages and limitations of each approach in turn
before introducing a recently developed technique:
constructing phylogenetic supertrees (sensu Sander-
son et al., 1998) using MRP (Baum, 1992; Ragan,
1992).
Character congruence has been promoted largely
on the principle of ‘ total evidence’ (sensu Kluge,
1989): the best phylogenetic hypothesis is the one
that uses all the available data and then as much
information within those data as possible. Its appeal
to many derives from the advantages of combining
the raw data. First, signals and subsignals within the
data can interact to support one another, yielding
relationships that were not indicated by any single
source study (‘signal enhancement ’, de Queiroz,
Donoghue & Kim, 1995; also Nixon & Carpenter,
1996). Second, studies are easily differentially
weighted to reflect confidence levels and sample
sizes. Finally, using the raw data means that the
descriptive and explanatory power of the solution is
maximized (Kluge & Wolf, 1993; Nixon &
Carpenter, 1996). For instance, the solution can be
used to infer processes such as character evolution
and support for it can be summarized using standard
metrics such as goodness-of-fit indices (Swofford,
1991), bootstrapping (Felsenstein, 1985a), or Bremer
support (Ka$ llersjo$ et al., 1992).
Disadvantages of character congruence include
the necessity of a single clustering or tree-building
technique (typically parsimony), which limits its use
to compatible data types only. Another potential
problem is whether data pointing to vastly different
solutions should be combined. This statistical ar-
gument takes its lead from ecology where one
routinely tests for data heterogeneity prior to
prospective pooling. Many have argued against
combining phylogenetic data lacking a single under-
lying distribution (e.g. Bull et al., 1993; de Queiroz
et al., 1995), but some remain unconvinced (e.g.
Nixon & Carpenter, 1996).
Taxonomic congruence instead combines trees
and thus is one step removed from the primary data.
To many, this is a less desirable approach, such that
taxonomic congruence is advocated more as a fall-
back option when character congruence cannot be
applied (e.g. data heterogeneity or incompatibility)
(Bull et al., 1993; Rodrigo et al., 1993; de Querioz et
al., 1995). This dual strategy has been referred to as
either ‘prior agreement ’ (Chippindale & Wiens,
1994) or the ‘conditional combination approach’
(Huelsenbeck, Bull & Cunningham, 1996). Taxo-
nomic congruence has also been criticized because
the choice of consensus technique used to combine
the source trees is essentially arbitrary (Kluge, 1989).
However, the strategy of combining trees presents
certain advantages. Methodologically, consensus
techniques find solutions in polynomial time as
opposed to the less efficient non-polynomial time of
optimization-based tree-building techniques
(Graham & Foulds, 1982). Therefore, taxonomic
congruence is less prone to size limitations than is
character congruence. Data sets are also combined
equally, preventing smaller ones from being
‘swamped’. Concerns about swamping have been
strongest for combining morphological and mol-
ecular data sets as the latter tend to be much larger
(Kluge, 1983; Miyamoto, 1985; Barrett, Donoghue
& Sober, 1991). However, swamping may be less of
a problem than formerly thought : most molecular
146 Olaf R. P. Bininda-Emonds, John L. Gittleman and Andy Purvis
characters are not phylogenetically informative (i.e.
they are invariant or the changes do not cluster taxa)
and so the two sources are often more equal in size
than they might first appear. Finally, it is easier to
visualize conflict between data sets using taxonomic
congruence because conflicting regions contain poly-
tomies (although this depends on the consensus
technique used to some degree). This becomes
important philosophically because many hold the
best hypothesis to be the one that has the most
independent lines of evidence supporting it
(Mickevich, 1978; Farris, 1983; Penny & Hendy,
1986; Novacek, 1992b).
A new solution for combining phylogenetic in-
formation is constructing phylogenetic supertrees.
Building supertrees, for which MRP is one method,
resembles taxonomic congruence methodologically
in that trees are combined rather than raw data.
Thus, supertrees can combine heterogeneous or
incompatible data. However, because the algorithms
do not use (conventional) consensus techniques to do
so, a distinguishing feature of supertrees is that the
source trees can possess different sets of terminal
taxa. [Except for Lanyon’s (1993) modified semi-
strict consensus algorithm, all consensus techniques
require source trees to have the same set of taxa.]
Due to its mechanics, MRP also possesses proper-
ties reminiscent of character congruence. Briefly,
MRP represents the pattern of relationships within a
source tree as a series of binary elements
(‘characters ’) describing each node in turn.
Descendants of a node are scored as ‘1 ’, all others
(except taxa missing from that source tree which
receive ‘? ’) as ‘0 ’ (Baum, 1992; Ragan, 1992). An
all-zero hypothetical outgroup is used to polarize the
elements. A parsimony algorithm perfectly recon-
structs any single tree coded in this manner and is
the ‘most efficient ’ means (Baum & Ragan, 1993, p.
638) of deriving a composite tree from many source
trees (Baum, 1992; Ragan, 1992).
Because trees are a graphical representation of the
signal within a data set, MRP is essentially a
parsimony analysis of the different phylogenetic
signals within each data set stripped of any con-
founding noise (i.e. homoplasy). Thus, it obtains
character congruence-like properties such as
occasionally indicating clades not found among any
of the source trees (analogous to signal enhancement)
and is less sensitive to conflict among source trees in
that the composite tree is usually well resolved
(Barrett et al., 1991; Purvis, 1995b ; Bininda-Emonds
& Bryant, 1998). Furthermore, differential levels of
support, both within and among source trees, can be
accounted for by weighting (Purvis, 1995b ;
Ronquist, 1996). Unfortunately, MRP faces size
limitations like any parsimony analysis, although
MRP analyses tend to be relatively ‘clean’, allowing
more taxa than usual to be analysed using exact
search algorithms.
An important distinction between MRP and
character congruence techniques is that the matrix
elements generated by MRP’s coding procedure for
each source tree are not independent, forming cliques
of elements that support one another. Because of
this, support for MRP analyses should not be
summarized by techniques like bootstrapping that
assume character independence (Purvis, 1995b).
Moreover, it means that MRP has a size bias.
Bigger, more resolved source trees contribute more
elements to the overall matrix and so tend to have
greater impact on the composite tree (Ronquist,
1996; Bininda-Emonds & Bryant, 1998). Attempts
to correct for the size bias using differential weighting
(Ronquist, 1996) or a modified coding procedure
(Purvis, 1995b) have been unsuccessful or shown to
be theoretically flawed (Ronquist, 1996; Bininda-
Emonds & Bryant, 1998). It is debatable whether
the bias is a shortcoming, but it does not appear to
be correctable and, at the very least, will cause
MRP to ‘combine trees ’ in a way we might not be
accustomed to. However, the bias is most apparent
when very limited numbers of source trees are
combined; with increasing numbers (as herein),
differences arising because of the bias appear to be
small (for a more complete discussion of this issue see
Bininda-Emonds & Bryant, 1998).
The full potential of MRP to combine phylo-
genetic information has yet to be fully explored;
however, it has already been used to produce a
composite tree for all extant primate species (Purvis,
1995a) and ones for bats, insectivores, and
marsupials are currently under construction.
III. METHODOLOGY
(1) Mechanics and limitations of matrix
representation
In addition to its potential shortcomings mentioned
above, MRP as applied here also has some his-
torically-based limitations. To some degree, the
method amounts to a majority rule summary of past
and present systematic opinion, and so will be
heavily biased against new, non-traditional hypoth-
eses, even if they are now widely accepted. A case in
point is the recent contention by Wyss (1987) of a
147Carnivoran phylogeny
walrus–phocid pairing to the exclusion of the otariids.
Although currently accepted by many pinniped
systematists (e.g. Flynn, 1988; Berta, 1991; Cozzuol,
1992; Wyss & Flynn, 1993; Berta & Wyss, 1994;
Vrana et al., 1994), this hypothesis has not yet
accumulated sufficient support to outweigh the
more traditional view of a walrus–otariid pairing.
Results from molecular studies would be expected to
suffer the most from this bias due to the relatively
recent origin of the field.
Additionally, our analyses do not provide a strong
test of the monophyly of some taxa because many of
our sources tacitly assume the monophyly of taxa
above the species level. We have minimized this
problem whenever possible by identifying the species
being referred to; however, this was often not
possible with older references, particularly those that
listed groups in a taxonomic fashion (thereby
implicitly including all species).
(2) Determination of the composite
phylogeny
Potential source trees were identified from on-line
searches of the Science Citation Index (1981–95; via
Bath Information and Data Services), Biological
Abstracts (1990–5), and Zoological Record (1978–
95) for any of the key words cladistic*, clado*,
classif*, phylogen*, systematic*, or taxonom* in
combination with any major carnivoran taxon name
(scientific or common). Additional sources were
obtained from references within previously found
articles. We restricted the search to between the
years 1970 and 1995 inclusive. Exceptions were
made only for ‘ landmark’ articles (e.g. Gregory &
Hellman, 1939; Leone & Wiens, 1956), ‘ in press ’
articles of which we were aware of by the end of
1995, and articles for groups (notably the herpestids
and viverrids) that otherwise yielded too few source
trees. Species assignments followed Wozencraft
(1993).
Our phylogeny explicitly details relationships
among extant carnivorans, for which we have
followed a recent and widely accepted species list
(Wozencraft, 1993). To our knowledge, this list
excludes only two putative carnivore species (besides
the domestic cat and dog): the Iriomote cat (Felis
iriomotensis) and a newly described viverrid (Viverra
tainguensis ; Sokolov, Rozhnov & Anh, 1997). How-
ever, the Iriomote cat was held to be an island
subspecies of the leopard cat (Felis bengalensis) by
Wozencraft (1993) and the taxonomic status of V.
tainguensis requires verification. Additionally, recog-
nizing that fossil information can overturn phylo-
genetic hypotheses based on extant forms alone
(Gauthier, Kluge & Rowe, 1988; Donoghue et al.,
1989; Novacek, 1992a), we included source trees
with fossil and extant species whenever possible.
Source trees were obtained from a total of 177
publications (see Appendix and Table 1 for a
breakdown according to family). Only that in-
formation which the author(s) indicated to have
phylogenetic relevance was used. Where a researcher
or group has published a series of papers using
virtually the same methodology and data source,
only the most recent and complete study was used.
However, when different researchers analysed the
same data source, we used each tree because
differences in the analyses (e.g. assumptions, use of
different segments of the same gene) might change
the results between the studies. Finally, when a
source contained multiple analyses of a given data
set, we combined the results of these analyses into a
single source tree using MRP.
Unlike Purvis (1995a), we drew no distinction
between source trees based on the type of analysis
used to obtain them. Hence, all elements from all
source trees received equal weight in the final
analysis. Because any choice of weights, including
equal weighting, is inevitably subjective (Barrett et
al., 1991), we also examine the effects of a differential
weighting scheme (see Purvis, 1995a).
The size of the problem precluded an efficient
single analysis of all species, so composite estimates
were made for the following taxa: Canidae, Felidae,
Herpestidae, Hyaenidae, Mustelidae (and Lutrinae
and Mephitinae therein), Otariidae, Phocidae,
Procyonidae, Ursidae (including the giant panda,
Ailuropoda melanoleuca), and Viverridae, and one
linking these taxa plus the monotypic walrus
(Odobenus rosmarus) and red panda (Ailurus fulgens)
together (‘higher groups ’). The nested estimates
were combined into a single tree in a process akin to
compartmentalization. Most of these groups are
widely, if not universally, accepted as monophyletic.
The only substantive objections that might be raised
lie with grouping Ailuropoda melanoleuca with the
ursids, and the assumed monophyly of procyonids,
mustelids and viverrids. Despite the historical con-
troversy surrounding the relationships of Ailuropoda
melanoleuca, the clear majority now hold it to be a
primitive ursid (O’Brien et al., 1985; see Mayr, 1986
for a summary). Among recent studies, only Peters
(1982) and Tagle et al. (1986; but see Czelusniak et
al., 1991) dissent from this view. Support for a
monophyletic Procyonidae comes from Seal, Phillips
148 Olaf R. P. Bininda-Emonds, John L. Gittleman and Andy Purvis
& Erickson (1970), Baskin (1982, 1989), Wozencraft
(1989), and Decker & Wozencraft (1991). While
growing evidence exists that the mephitines are only
distantly related to the remaining mustelids
(Arnason & Widegren, 1986; Wayne et al., 1989a ;
Arnason & Ledje, 1993; Vrana et al., 1994; Ledje &
Arnason, 1996), this claim still requires further
substantiation. There is also speculation that the
African palm civet (Nandinia binotata) may be a
primitive feloid, and not a viverrid, based on the
primitive morphology of its auditory bulla (Hunt,
1974; Wiig, 1985; Flynn, Neff & Tedford, 1988;
Hunt & Tedford, 1993; Flynn, 1996), but we could
not adequately test this hypothesis because the
topological disparity of the two hypotheses was
difficult to accommodate under the constraints of the
nested analysis. Therefore, we assumed Nandinia
binotata to be a viverrid.
Matrices were constructed using the data editor of
MacClade 3.05 (Maddison & Maddison, 1992). A
hypothetical all-zero outgroup was added to each to
polarize the elements. All matrices were analysed
with PAUP 3.1.1 (Swofford, 1993). The exact
branch-and-bound algorithm was used for matrices
with fewer than 20 taxa. For larger matrices, we used
the approximate heuristic algorithm with a random
addition sequence (25 repetitions), TBR branch
swapping on minimal trees only (steepest descent
on), collapsed zero length branches, and unlimited
MAXTREES. Equally most parsimonious solutions
were summarized using strict consensus.
Only one search could not be completed due to
memory limitations. Initial results for the herpestids
were highly unresolved (see Fig. 11A), with at least
30000 most parsimonious solutions, because many
herpestid species have scarcely been investigated
systematically. Because the phylogenetic position of
many species is unknown beyond a certain level (e.g.
subfamilial or generic assessment), MRP indicates
all placements within that clade to be equally
parsimonious, collapsing the clade to a bush under
strict consensus. To improve resolution within this
family, we applied safe taxonomic reduction
(Wilkinson, 1995) to identify poorly known taxa
whose (few) matrix elements were identical with
those of one or more of the more completely known
species and provided no novel clustering infor-
mation. Twelve species were identified in this
manner and removed from the analysis. However,
contra Wilkinson (1995), these species were reinserted
into the tree at the most basal position indicated for
them in the literature (dashed branches in Fig. 11B).
For example, both Dologale dybowskii and Rhynchogale
melleri are known to be herpestines, but no study has
placed them any more precisely, so both taxa were
added to the basal node of this subfamily. Such
placements do not strictly reflect phylogeny
(although weak membership statements can be made
from them), but rather identify poorly studied taxa,
much like Adams consensus (Adams, 1972) identifies
‘rogue’ taxa among many competing source trees.
Although the same lack of information applied to the
intrageneric relationships of the procyonids (see Fig.
5), safe taxonomic reduction could not improve the
resolution there.
We use Bremer support (Bremer, 1988; Ka$ llersjo$
et al., 1992) to estimate the robustness of each node
in the composite tree. Bremer support indicates how
much less parsimonious the tree would have to be
before the clade in question disappears. Bremer
support depends on how many characters or
elements there are (Novacek, 1991) and how well
they agree, so values may be low because of small
numbers of source trees or conflict among them (see
‘Results and Discussion’).
(3) Establishing times of divergence
Following Purvis (1995a), a combination of absolute
(fossil and point molecular estimates) and relative
(molecular) dates from the literature were used to
date the composite tree (see Appendix). Both kinds
of data present inherent difficulties.
No clear guidelines have emerged for estimating
times of divergence from the fossil record. We
followed Wayne, Van Valkenburgh & O’Brien
(1991) in using the time of first occurrence of either
descendant lineage, unless there was good phylo-
genetic or biogeographic evidence to the contrary.
One problem with fossil information is the greater
instability of fossil systematics (e.g. see McKenna &
Bell, 1997). This reflects (1) changes in phylogenetic
opinion caused by the discovery of new species or of
additional material for poorly known species, and
(2) that, historically, fossil species were frequently
grouped taxonomically rather than phylo-
genetically. (Similar problems affect analyses of
extant forms, but are generally less severe and fossil
systematics is becoming increasingly based on more
robust, cladistic methodology.) Taxonomic group-
ings tend to be unstable at many levels (e.g. tribe,
subfamily), something also arising from shifts in
phylogenetic opinion. Thus, the context of a taxon
might have changed since a fossil species was assigned
to it. For example, Viverridae long included
mongooses and kin as the subfamily Herpestinae
149Carnivoran phylogeny
(despite the lack of any derived features uniting
them; see Wozencraft, 1989). However, since
Wozencraft (1989), the elevation of mongooses (as
Herpestidae) to equivalent status as viverrids has
been increasingly accepted. Thus, when using fossil
information that predates this taxonomic change,
one must ensure that the fossil ‘viverrid’ is what we
would recognize as a viverrid today.
Furthermore, not all fossil information is usable
in the current context. The absence of fossil species in
our phylogeny means the divergence estimated by
many fossils will not be present, particularly those
that predate the most recent common ancestry of the
extant taxa. For example, Hesperocyon is widely
regarded as the oldest known canid, but since it is
not a member of the clade including extant forms
(Savage & Russell, 1983; Wang, 1994), its time of
first occurrence cannot be used to date their
radiation. Information from Hesperocyon would, how-
ever, be appropriate for dating the divergence of all
canids from the remaining caniforms.
Altogether, these problems necessitate care to be
exercised when using fossil dates. Our general
strategy was to use information from relatively well
known and stable fossil species only and then to use
it to establish divergence times for nodes equivalent
to the more robust taxonomic levels (generally
families and genera). This strategy provided dates
for 129 nodes.
The use of molecular data to derive times of
divergence is hampered by different lineages evolv-
ing at different rates (Gillespie, 1991; Wayne et al.,
1991; Flynn, 1996) and evidence of a decrease in the
rate of change with increasing divergence times
(Wayne et al., 1991; Gittleman et al., 1996). As such,
calibrating molecular information to a few widely
spaced nodes of known age will likely lead to
correlated errors (and typically underestimates ;
Wayne et al., 1991) throughout the tree. As in Purvis
(1995a), the concept of a local molecular clock
(Bailey et al., 1991) was employed to minimize
potential errors. Briefly, this method estimates the
date of a node relative to some (not necessarily
immediately) ancestral node based on relative
branch lengths (see Purvis, 1995a for more detail
and a worked example). Whenever possible, the
branch lengths we used for this were derived from
the original pairwise matrices in the source paper.
A total of 74 studies yielded 545 point estimates
(293 fossil, 236 molecular and 16 from a study
assimilating both types) for 150 nodes throughout
the tree. To minimize the effect of outliers, the
divergence time for a node was calculated as the
median of available estimates. Whatever their
source, estimates of divergence time are likely to be
underestimates. Fossil dates will consistently be so
because the first appearance in the fossil record need
not correspond with the origin of a taxon (Marshall,
1990; Flynn, 1996). This bias will, in turn, affect the
relative molecular estimates, as we calibrated such
estimates against fossil dates. The negative cor-
relation between divergence time and the rate of
molecular change further compounds this problem
for molecular estimates, particularly when cali-
brations are based on only a few nodes. We therefore
incorporated fossil dates throughout the tree (unlike
Purvis, 1995a).
Finally, dates for those nodes that did not possess
an estimate in the literature were interpolated using
a pure birth model, under which a clade’s age is
proportional to the logarithm of the number of
species it contains (see Purvis, 1995a, p. 416).
Estimates were calibrated relative to dated ancestral
and, unlike Purvis (1995a), from dated descendent
nodes whenever possible. The use of more than one
calibration point should reduce errors associated
with erroneous dating of calibration points. Our
interpolations are intended more to accommodate
those comparative methods requiring a complete set
of branch lengths than as precise estimates of
divergence times. Factors such as extinction may
differentially reduce the representation of some of
the older lineages and other related biases also exist.
Fortunately, comparative methods are reasonably
robust to errors in branch length information
(Purvis, Gittleman & Luh, 1994) and the majority of
nodes (150 of 211) had divergence times derived
from literature estimates.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(1) Distribution of taxonomic coverage
Prior systematic effort has not been distributed
evenly throughout the carnivores (Table 1). The
groups for which there are most source trees include
canids, felids, mustelids, phocids, ursids, and the
interfamilial relationships of the carnivores. This
uneven distribution of effort has many causes.
Geographic distribution (largely Africa and southern
Asia) and cryptic habits both count against
herpestids and viverrids, whereas some families have
been targeted by particular research groups (e.g.
U. Arnason & colleagues for phocids, S. J. O’Brien
& colleagues for felids, R. K. Wayne & colleagues
for canids), often with conservation in mind. Ad-

carnivoran taxa. The parenthetical value of per cent resolution for herpestids refers to when safe taxonomic reduction

ditionally, researchers have been attracted to groups
whose relationships are controversial. Finally, many
species that are poorly known systematically are also
unstudied with respect to other biological character-
istics. It is unsurprising that most of these species are
nocturnal, solitary, fast, and have large home ranges,
often in poorly inhabited or remote regions (see
Gittleman, 1989, 1996).
The groups that have been studied the most often
also tend to have the most binary elements per
taxon. However, this latter measure does distinguish
among the more poorly studied groups, with the
herpestids and procyonids lagging behind the rest.
A final measure, the ‘coverage index’ (i.e.
elements per source tree per taxon), reveals how
thoroughly a group has been investigated in each
study. High values indicate that individual studies
have on average examined a large proportion of the
constituent taxa (although the number of elements is
also determined by the resolution of the source tree).
Hyaenids, lutrines, mephitines, and phocids have
high coverage indices. Except for the phocids, these
groups did not have many source trees. Groups with
low coverage indices include the canids, felids,
herpestids, and mustelids. Note that a low coverage
index does not necessarily imply that only the same
few taxa have been examined in each tree (although
this is true of herpestids). Given the inherent
difficulties in examining a larger number of taxa, it
is unsurprising that smaller groups tend to have
higher coverage indices than do the larger ones
(r#fl 0–43, Pfl 0–01).
The numbers for the viverrids are deceptive. This
family has generally been poorly studied; however,
the complete species-level phylogeny of Wozencraft
(1984) obscures this. Without this study, the number
of elements for viverrids would drop by over a third
and the two ratios would fall to the levels found in
other poorly studied taxa. The exclusion would also
improve the correlation between the coverage index
and the size of the group (r#fl 0–51, Pfl 0–006).
(2) Resolution and robustness
The composite tree (divided among Figs 1–12;
presented as a whole in Fig. 13) contains 211 nodes,
making it 78–1% resolved compared to a fully
bifurcating solution. Resolution varies among
groups, ranging between 27–8% (herpestids) and
100% (higher groups) (Table 1). Removing the
poorly known herpestid species (see ‘Methodology’)
improves the resolution for this family to 55–6%.
Apart from the herpestids, the poorest resolution was
for the Procyonidae (52.9%). Most groups were at
least 70% resolved, and three (felids, phocids and
viverrids) were more than 90% resolved. However,
for the viverrids, the resolution is again due to
Wozencraft’s (1984) full species-level analysis. If this
study were excluded, resolution for the family would
fall to 69–7%.

tend to show higher Bremer support values
(r#fl 0–17, P! 0–0001) because relationships at
these levels are more agreed upon and better studied.
Many phylogenies, particularly molecular ones,
detail relationships among somewhat distantly re-
lated species. This provides information at the older,
higher levels, but none for the more closely related
sister species that are missing from the analysis.
The differential weighting of source trees ac-
cording to the data and}or methodology used to
obtain them had little impact on the composite tree
(Tables 2–13). When more robust source trees
(following Purvis, 1995a) were weighted four times
as heavily, only 10 of the 211 nodes of the composite
tree were contradicted, most often due to a slightly
altered position for a single clade (which auto-
matically results in two, non-independent contra-
dictions). Differential weighting also resolved six
polytomies within the composite tree. This extra
resolution is not surprising given that weighting
certain elements essentially amounts to increasing
their number within the matrix, which has been
demonstrated to increase resolution (Hillis &
Huelsenbeck, 1992; Wheeler, 1992). However, three
nodes within the herpestids collapsed under the
differential weighting scheme, including the basal

seems that most source trees are giving the same
general pattern of carnivore phylogeny, regardless of
the data or methodology used to generate them.
(3) Times of divergence
Date estimates were obtained from the literature for
150 nodes on the composite tree, 73 of which had at
least one estimate from both fossil and molecular
sources. Four families plus the higher level relation-
ships had date estimates for every node, with all
remaining families except herpestids and viverrids
having at least 66% coverage. For these latter two
families, date estimates were only available for eight
out of 20 (40–0%) and seven out of 32 (21–9%)
nodes, respectively.
Errors in median dates were reasonable, with
‘coefficients of variation’ (calculated relative to the
median and not the mean) exceeding 100% for only
12 nodes of the 105 that possessed two or more date
estimates. Using a one-way analysis of variance of
log-transformed dates with node number as the

estimate was calculated as ‡80%. Fortunately, the
effect of all these errors on comparative studies
should be minimal, given that all estimates are likely
to be underestimates and that comparative methods
are fairly robust in such cases (Purvis et al., 1994;
Purvis, 1995a).
Generally, nodes with higher ‘coefficients of
variation’ were (1) relatively recent, making any
error proportionately larger or (2) those whose dates
were derived from very few estimates, allowing a
single discrepant estimate to inflate the standard
deviation (and hence our reason for using medians
rather than means). Naturally, there are exceptions.
For example, despite the nodes for the ursine bears
(node 3 on Fig. 8), the genus Panthera (node 11 on
Fig. 10), and that uniting Alopex lagopus with Vulpes
velox (node 20 on Fig. 9) being strongly supported
and having dates estimated from a relatively large
number of sources (e.g. 17 in the case of the ursine
bears), the ‘coefficients of variation’ in each case
exceeded 100%.
Eleven of the 236 molecular estimates were single
point estimates and so could not be re-calibrated.
The remaining molecular estimates were calibrated
against a total of 56 nodes. The nodes used most
often for calibration include the basal node for the
Arctoidea (20 estimates), the canid-arctoid diver-
gence (17), the caniform-feliform divergence (15),
and the basal nodes for many families (e.g. mustelids,
phocids, ursids). Nodes with only a single date
estimate (either fossil or molecular) were used as
calibration points on only five occasions and none
was used to calibrate more than two nodes.
Twenty-two nodes were estimated to be older
than an ancestral one (resulting in a negative branch
length). In most (15), the difference was less than
100% of the age of the ancestral node. The largest
discrepancy was 770% (nodes 21 and 22 in the
Mustelidae; Fig. 2; Table 3). Felids and mustelids
had the largest number of negative branch lengths
with six apiece. The basal nodes for felids, herpestids
and phocids, upon which molecular estimates within
these families largely depend, were indicated to be
more recent than a descendent node. The con-
sistency of dates within herpestids and viverrids
probably arises from there being very few date
estimates for either family.
Negative branch lengths normally arose in one of
two ways. First, they were more likely if at least one
of the dates was based on three or fewer estimates or
was derived from the pure birth model. Such dates
tend to have larger confidence intervals, so many of

the negative branch lengths are simply overlapping
regions of uncertainty. The second way applies only
to dates derived from fossil information and occurs
when a well-recognized clade, believed to be
relatively ancient, is in a fairly terminal position
within the phylogeny. Some taxa with good fossil
records were indicated to have (frequently mono-
typic) sister groups with a poor one. Therefore,
divergence times will be underestimates when taken
to be the time of first occurrence of the apparently
much younger sister group. This problem is
exacerbated if the crown clade of an ancient lineage
has diversified only recently. Dates obtained solely
from molecular sources frequently resolved the
inconsistency; however, such estimates were not
always available.
(4) Fossil versus molecular dates
Are fossil and molecular estimates of divergence
times similar? Wayne et al. (1991) showed that
molecular distance data are highly correlated with
fossil estimates of divergence time within carnivores
and primates. However, fossil and molecular esti-
mates could be highly correlated and yet still differ
systematically. We examined this possibility by
considering the 73 nodes that possessed at least one
estimate from both fossil and molecular sources.

estimate [52–0 million years before present (MYBP);
Sarich, 1969b] was derived from an albumin clock
calibrated with primate data while the other (40–6
MYBP; Goodman et al., 1982) used a molecular
clock of many different proteins calibrated using an
estimate of 90 MYBP for the common ancestor of all
extant eutherian mammals. Thus, the average
calibration point (46–3 MYBP) was independent of
the carnivore fossil record. This does not seem
appropriate given that different lineages evolve at
different rates (Gillespie, 1991; Wayne et al., 1991;
Flynn, 1996) and any rate anomalies peculiar to the
carnivores would therefore likely be missed.
When the molecular estimates are calibrated
against the carnivore fossil record (using the median
estimate of 55–0 MYBP obtained from the fossil
sources), they now clearly provide significantly older
estimates (paired t of log-transformed datesflfi3–71,
Pfl 0–0004). This seems reasonable given that fossil
estimates will nearly always be underestimates of the
true time of divergence (Marshall, 1990; Flynn,
1996). We add that although both differences are

significant, they are small. Back-transforming shows
the mean difference in dates between the two sources
to be either 1–3 or 1–5 million years, depending on
the calibration point used. In approximately a third
of the cases, these values are smaller than the
standard errors associated with either data source for
a given node (results not shown).
The discrepancy between the two tests stems from
Goodman et al.’s (1982) date for the divergence of
the (extant) carnivores being substantially more
recent than both Sarich’s (1969b) and the fossil
estimate. This arises from their use of a calibration
point of 90 MYBP for the origin of the extant
eutherians, a figure now held to be at least 30 million
years too recent (Graur, 1993; U. Arnason, per-
sonal communication). Although we used the orig-

inal date estimate for the divergence of the carnivores
advocated by Goodman et al. (1982), it is interesting
that using the currently held value of 120 MYBP for
the calibration point shifts Goodman et al.’s (1982)
value to 54–1 MYBP in agreement with the other
estimates. At the very least, this highlights the
importance of using an accurate calibration point to
derive divergence times using molecular data.
(5) Systematic implications
Detailed comments concerning all proposed relation-
ships specified by the composite tree are beyond the
scope of this review. Instead, we highlight some
results in areas of particular historical interest. The
composite tree is merely a (most parsimonious)
synthesis of a number of source trees ; therefore,
direct evidence supporting (or refuting) particular
relationships on the composite tree should be sought
from the original references.
Among the higher groups (Fig. 1), two long-
standing areas of contention concern the relation-
ships of the red panda (Ailurus fulgens) and those of
the pinnipeds. The composite tree places Ailurus
fulgens as the sister group to the clade of mustelids

plus procyonids, a relationship advocated directly by
only Braunitzer & Hofmann (1987). In part, this
unusual placement reflects the support for an Ailurus
fulgens–procyonid clade (four source trees), but one
that is outweighed by 10 source trees linking
mustelids and procyonids with no statement re-
garding Ailurus fulgens. Interestingly, more source
trees (11) advocate allying Ailurus fulgens with the
ursids, but this solution is not globally most
parsimonious. It should be noted that support for the
placement of the red panda in the composite tree is
exceptionally weak compared to the remaining
nodes at this level (Table 2). The pinnipeds are held
to be monophyletic in agreement with current
opinion, but with an unusual sister group: the
Musteloidea (plus Ailurus fulgens) in place of the more
commonly suggested ursids. The composite tree also
shows strong support for the traditional Otarioidea
(odobenids plus otariids), in contrast to Wyss’s
(1987) recent assertion of an odobenid–phocid
pairing.
Within mustelids (Fig. 2), the monophyly of the
classic Simpsonian subfamilies (Lutrinae, Melinae,
Mellivorinae, Mephitinae, Mustelinae; Simpson,
1945) are upheld with the possible exception of the
badgers (Melinae) and ignoring the monotypic
Mellivorinae. Although no definite statement can be
made regarding the cladistic status of the former
subfamily, the position of the meline taxa at the base
of the tree suggests that it might have been originally
erected on the basis of shared primitive features
(symplesiomorphies). In our analyses, the mephi-
tines (skunks) were constrained to be mustelids ;
however, the large negative branch length around
this region (Tables 3 and 5) suggests a more ancient
origin of this group and may support the paraphyly
of the Mustelidae (e.g. Arnason & Widegren, 1986;
Wayne et al., 1989a ; Arnason & Ledje, 1993; Vrana
et al., 1994; Ledje & Arnason, 1996). Relationships
within the mustelids are generally not strongly
supported (Tables 3–5). All subgenera of Mustela
(see Youngman, 1982; Nowak, 1991) are indicated
to be monophyletic except the nominal subgenus
(species altaica, erminea, frenata, kathiah and nivalis)
(Fig. 2). Within otters (Fig. 3), Lutra is polyphyletic
and there is much uncertainty regarding the relation-
ships among the major lineages. Among mephitines
(Fig. 4), the South American species of Conepatus
(chinga, humboldtii and semistriatus) do not form a
single clade.
The procyonids are divided into their two recog-

intermediate support (Fig. 5; Table 6). The lack of
resolution within Bassaricyon and Procyon reflects a
complete lack of information as noted previously.
The composite tree bears on two issues within the
pinnipeds. Within otariids (Fig. 6), there is much
uncertainty concerning the fur seals (genera Arcto-
cephalus and Callorhinus). Monophyly of this sub-
family cannot be assured, supporting the view that
subfamilial distinction within the otariids is un-
necessary (Tedford, 1976; Repenning & Tedford,
1977). Relationships within Arctocephalus are largely
unresolved due to both a general lack of research
effort and conflicting source trees, the latter possibly
owing to the high degree of convergence among
species (Berta & Deme! re! , 1986). In contrast, the
phocid tree (Fig. 7) is more resolved and addresses
four hypotheses of paraphyly within the family. The
genus Phoca is indicated to be paraphyletic [although
its subgenera (see Burns & Fay, 1970) are mono-
phyletic] with respect to Halichoerus grypus, a point
often raised in the literature (e.g. Chapskii, 1955;
McLaren, 1975; de Muizon, 1982b ; Wyss, 1988;
Arnason et al., 1993, 1995; Mouchaty, Cook &
Shields, 1995; Perry et al., 1995). Other hypotheses
of paraphyly within the phocids are not supported
here: the subfamily Monachinae (Wyss, 1988), the
tribe Lobodontini (Bininda-Emonds & Russell,
1996), and the genus Monachus (Wyss, 1988) are all
monophyletic in the composite tree. Finally, Arnason
et al. (1996) have used the divergence of Phoca
163Carnivoran phylogeny
actually equivalent to node 5 on Fig. 7) as a
standard reference for calibrating recent mammalian
divergence events (the ‘Phoca standard’) ; however,
Table 8 indicates their estimate of 2–7 MYBP to be
too recent.
The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), which
was constrained in our analyses to be an ursid (see
‘Methodology’), is very clearly the sister group to
the other bears in the composite tree (Fig. 8; Table
9). The position of the American black bear (Ursus
americanus) remains contentious and merits further
investigation; the polytomy in this region agrees
with recent, independent molecular findings
(L. Waits, personal communication). At present, the
monophyly of Ursus is not assured, which supports
continuing calls for a revision of the genus-level
taxonomy of ursids (see Goldman, Giri & O’Brien,
1989; Zhang & Ryder, 1994). The close association
between the brown and polar bears (U. arctos and U.
maritimus, respectively) is upheld, reflecting sugges-
tions that the two might be conspecific (e.g. Cronin
et al., 1991; Talbot & Shields, 1996). The elevation
of the polar bear to its own genus (Thalarctos ; Corbet
& Hill, 1991) is clearly not appropriate without
additional taxonomic alterations.
Canids are divided into two main clades (Fig. 9),
corresponding roughly to the ‘dog-like ’ and ‘ fox-
like ’ forms of many authors (flCanini and Vulpini,
respectively, of Tedford, Taylor & Wang, 1995).
The problematic genera Nyctereutes and Otocyon
cluster with the dog-like and fox-like clades, re-
spectively, although Nyctereutes could almost equally
well be placed with Otocyon (results not shown). Of
the monotypic dog-like genera, only the Falkland
Island wolf (Dusicyon australis) is placed un-
ambiguously, forming the sister group to the South
American ‘ foxes ’ (Pseudalopex spp.), which have
frequently been considered to belong in the same
genus as it. Canis forms a well-defined clade divided
into ‘wolf-like ’ and ‘ jackal-like ’ forms. The Simien
jackal (C. simensis) clearly clusters with the wolf-like
forms and so justifies its less frequently used common
name of the Ethiopian wolf (see Gottelli et al., 1994;
Geffen et al., 1996). The red wolf (C. rufus) forms the
sister taxon to the grey wolf (C. lupus), although the
support for this placement is overestimated in Table
10. Several authors (e.g. Wayne & Jenks, 1991; Roy
et al., 1994; possibly Lawrence & Bossert, 1967) hold
C. rufus to be a hybrid between the coyote and the
grey wolf, which we coded as a polytomy between
the three species. However, in our analyses, a
polytomy is always outweighed by any fully resolved
answer. Two studies advocated a hybrid origin while
four clustered C. rufus with C. lupus as on the
composite tree. With the exception of the South
American ‘ foxes ’, the fox-like canids form a distinct
cluster with Otocyon and Urocyon in basal positions.
Vulpes is indicated to be paraphyletic with respect to
the Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), an outcome sup-
porting those arguing against the generic distinction
of the latter (e.g. Tedford et al., 1995).
The composite tree for felids is largely resolved
(Fig. 10), but the backbone is weakly supported
(Table 11), reflecting the historical controversy over
felid phylogeny. Three of the better supported clades
(nodes 7, 19 and 26) correspond to major clades in
recent molecular phylogenies from S. J. O’Brien’s
research group: the Panthera group, the ocelot
lineage, and the domestic cat lineage, respectively
(see O’Brien et al., 1996). Most of the extant species
within the ocelot lineage radiated between 3–7 and
3–0 MYBP (Table 11). Although this time scale
accords with some estimates of the earliest formation
of the Panamanian land bridge (e.g. White, 1986;
Martin, 1989), it predates others (e.g. Stehli &
Webb, 1985; Wayne et al., 1991) as well as the first
appearance of fossil felids in South America (1–9–2–4
MYBP; Hunt, 1996) and the time of the greatest
faunal exchange between North and South America
(Plio-Pleistocene; Hunt, 1996). If our dates are
accurate, they suggest that much of the diversi-
fication within the ocelot lineage may have occurred
before it reached South America (contra Pecon
Slattery et al., 1994) or shortly thereafter. The
pantherine lineage of O’Brien et al. (1996) is not
monophyletic in our tree, being split into a major
terminal clade (node 6) and numerous smaller
lineages in the basal portion of the composite tree.
The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) occupies its traditional
position as sister taxon to the remaining felids (Kra! l
& Zima, 1980; Martin, 1980) rather than to Puma
(contra O’Brien et al., 1996). Within the terminal
clade, the golden cats (Catopuma temminckii and
Profelis aurata) are paraphyletic with respect to the
bay cat (Catopuma badia), rather than polyphyletic as
found by O’Brien et al. (1996). Despite the lack of
robustness of many nodes, all but two of the genera
recognized by Wozencraft (1993), Leopardus and
Oncifelis, are monophyletic. Altogether, the pattern
we found of well-supported groups of uncertain
interrelationships (i.e. the weak backbone) reflects
current opinion of felid phylogeny (S. J. O’Brien,
personal communication).
In hyaenids (Fig. 1), the only point of consensus is
the sister group status of the aardwolf (Proteles
cristatus) to the remaining species. The traditional
164 Olaf R. P. Bininda-Emonds, John L. Gittleman and Andy Purvis
view that Crocuta crocuta was the sister group to the
previously congeneric Hyaena hyaena and Parahyaena
brunnea has fallen out of favour recently (see Werdelin
& Solounias, 1991), but no dominant opinion has
replaced it : all three possible resolutions of the
polytomy were represented at least once among the
five relevant source trees.
The initial analysis of all herpestid species sup-
ported only the monophyly of the two subfamilies
and the genera within them (Fig. 11A). However,
removing the poorly known species from the analysis
(see ‘Methodology’) revealed a surprising amount
of structure within herpestines, although resolution
within genera is still poor (Fig. 11B). The positions
of two genera, Dologale and Rhynchogale, within
herpestines are completely unknown and their
positions in Fig. 11B should be treated as highly
suspect. This family in general and the poorly known
species in particular (whose indicated positions are
more statements of membership than hypotheses of
relationship) need further systematic research.
Viverrids (Fig. 12) cluster into their commonly
recognized subfamilies (see Wozencraft, 1993).
Nandinia binotata forms the sister group to the
paradoxurines in our analysis, but our assumption of
viverrid monophyly precluded a test of the sugges-
tion that it may be a primitive feliform (Hunt, 1974;
Wiig, 1985; Flynn et al., 1988; Hunt & Tedford,
1993; Flynn, 1996; but see Radinsky, 1975).
Evidence for the latter placement relies largely on
the morphology of the auditory bulla. An equal
number of studies based on a wider selection of data
place Nandinia binotata within viverrids (e.g. Gregory
& Hellman, 1939; Petter, 1974; Stains, 1983;
Wozencraft, 1984; Taylor, 1988); however, these
studies may not have directly tested this question.
Removal of the unusually comprehensive (and
possibly dominating) study of Wozencraft (1984)
did not alter the basic topology, but decreases
resolution within the paradoxurines and Genetta
(results not shown). Table 13 shows that three
viverrid lineages are long-lived, diversifying before
those in other families, if not before the diversi-
fication of (the extant members of) the families
themselves.
In summary, instances of non-monophyly were
rare, occurring only for the genera Lutra (lutrines),
Phoca (phocids), Vulpes (canids), Leopardus (felids),
Oncifelis (felids), and possibly Ursus (ursids) ; the
nominal subgenus of Mustela (mustelids) ; and some
other felid groups. This low level of non-monophyly
reflects both tacit assumptions of monophyly of
higher level taxa (see ‘Methodology’), but probably
also the general consensus over current carnivoran
taxonomy.
(6) Macroevolutionary trends
To illustrate the utility of our complete phylogeny
for studies of macroevolution, we have used it to
pinpoint evolutionary radiations ; that is, lineages
containing significantly more species than expected
for their age. The null expectation comes from a
model in which all contemporaneous lineages have
the same propensity to diversify (Nee et al., 1995).
We do not assume any particular model of clado-
genesis such as a constant-rates birth–death model.
The test, implemented in End-Epi (Rambaut,
Harvey & Nee, 1997), identifies ancestral lineages
that have given rise to ‘more than their fair share ’ of
extant species in comparison with their contem-
poraries (see Purvis, Nee & Harvey, 1995 for a more
detailed description).
The results are shown in Fig. 13. Eight lineages
contain significantly more species than expected
(P! 0–05), with six of them significant at the
Pfl 0–01 level. Note that radiations are not in-
dependent : if a lineage is a radiation, more inclusive
clades will also tend to be. Interpreting Fig. 13 must
therefore be tentative, but there is at least one
radiation within each of Mustelinae and Canidae.
The genus Procyon (node 4 in Fig. 5) also appears to
be a radiation, but its date of divergence is based
upon a single estimate and so may be inaccurate. No
radiations are apparent within Feliformia when the
order is analysed as a whole. However, if Caniformia
(including pinnipeds) and Feliformia are analysed
separately, four feliform radiations are significant at
the Pfl 0–01 level. These are Felidae (Fig. 10),
Genetta (node 6 in Fig. 12), node 6 within Felidae
(Fig. 10) and node 8 within Herpestidae (Fig. 11B);
the latter two, however, are dated from single
estimates. No new radiations appear when Cani-
formia is analysed on its own. Our results tentatively
corroborate the suggestion that extant fields are an
adaptive radiation (e.g. O’Brien et al., 1996), but do
not support similar inferences for the phocine seals
(e.g. Ray, 1976; Mouchaty et al., 1995) or ursine
bears (e.g. O’Brien et al., 1985; Goldman et al.,
1989). As more radiations are identified from further
large phylogenies, it will become possible to test for
general correlates of extreme diversification (Purvis,
1996).
Interestingly, our results suggest that the dis-
tribution of species among lineages is much more
even in Carnivora than in Primates, where the
165Carnivoran phylogeny
Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys) constitute a
massive radiation (Purvis et al., 1995). There is also
a marked difference in the distribution of species-
poor lineages. According to Tables 2–13, 19 car-
nivore species last shared a common ancestor with
any other extant species more than 15 MYBP. By
comparison, only three primate species are so
isolated (Purvis, 1995a). Even allowing for un-
certainties in the dates, these differences between
carnivores and primates clearly merit further investi-
gation.
V. CONCLUSIONS
(1) Supertree construction is a powerful new tool for
building larger and more comprehensive phylo-
genies. MRP in particular combines positive aspects
of both character and taxonomic congruence
approaches.
(2) By using MRP, we have constructed the first
full species-level phylogeny for all extant species of
Carnivora from a wide variety of data sources
spanning 25 years of systematic research into this
mammalian order. The incompatibility and po-
tential heterogeneity in signal among some of these
data sets would preclude obtaining an answer using
character congruence, and taxonomic congruence’s
reliance on consensus techniques would result in a
much less resolved answer.
(3) Our composite tree shows that disparate
studies of carnivoran phylogeny agree to a surprising
extent : poorly resolved taxa are generally those that
have been studied least. More research is clearly
merited for herpestids and viverrids as a whole and
within the procyonid genera Bassaricyon and Procyon.
For some other questions (e.g. relationships among
felid genera and among hyaenines, and the positions
of the red panda and of the monotypic ‘dog-like ’
canid genera), no clear answers have emerged despite
considerable effort. Additional data may help resolve
these issues ; however, it may be that they are
inherently difficult because they involve successive
splitting events that were close together in time, and
long ago.
(4) The tree we present is the largest complete
species-level phylogeny for any group. It will provide
a touchstone for many kinds of comparative study
within carnivores (e.g. character evolution, macro-
evolutionary studies, conservation studies) and has
already been used to test for correlations between
population size and geographic range in British
mammals (Blackburn et al., 1997), between body size
and species richness in all carnivores (Gittleman &
Purvis, 1998), between foraging strategy and the
extent of stereotypic behaviour displayed by captive
carnivores (Clubb & Mason, 1998), and to examine
for edge effects with respect to the conservation
biology of large carnivores (Woodroffe & Ginsberg,
1998). Our tree also serves as a strawman for further
systematic research into this fascinating order.
