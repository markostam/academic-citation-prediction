ABSTRACT
We have developed a novel DNA microarray-based
approach for identification of the sequence-
specificity of single-stranded nucleic-acid-binding
proteins (SNABPs). For verification, we have shown
that the major cold shock protein (CspB) from
Bacillus subtilis binds with high affinity to
pyrimidine-rich sequences, with a binding prefer-
ence for the consensus sequence, 50-GTCTTTG/T-30.
The sequence was modelled onto the known
structure of CspB and a cytosine-binding pocket
was identified, which explains the strong preference
for a cytosine base at position 3. This microarray
method offers a rapid high-throughput approach
for determining the specificity and strength of
ss DNA–protein interactions. Further screening of
this newly emerging family of transcription factors
will help provide an insight into their cellular function.
INTRODUCTION
We show that microarray technology can provide rapid
high-throughput assays for the identiﬁcation of sequence-
speciﬁc ss DNA–protein interactions. The majority of
transcription factors recognize target sequences in duplex
form. However, single-stranded regions can be induced by
torsional stress of double-stranded DNA, allowing single-
stranded nucleic-acid-binding proteins (SNABPs) access
to their binding sites (1). SNABPs have been shown to
bind with high aﬃnity, non-speciﬁcally (2) and speciﬁcally
(3), to ss DNA, which has been shown to regulate gene
expression both positively and negatively (1,4). Gene
expression can also be regulated on a translational level,
by SNABP binding to mRNA (5).
Genome sequencing has allowed SNABPs to be
identiﬁed and characterized for a range of eukaryotic
and prokaryotic organisms. To understand how binding
of SNABPs to ss nucleic acids regulates transcription and
translation, the regions of sequence speciﬁcity must be
identiﬁed. Many techniques including electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) (6), nitrocellulose-binding
assays (7), Southwestern blotting (8), phage display (9),
UV cross-linking (10) and X-ray crystallography (11) were
developed to study sequence-speciﬁc ss DNA–protein
interactions. Available techniques including, ﬂuorescence
measurements (12), polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) combined
with a DNA foot-printing assay (13), surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) and ﬂuorescence polarization (14) have
all been used to study eﬀectively speciﬁc ss DNA–protein
interactions. The most frequent approach used to study
the sequence speciﬁcity of DNA-binding molecules is by
systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment
(SELEX), this method allows for the identiﬁcation of
sequences which bind with high aﬃnity to the molecule of
interest (15). This method has been used mostly to select
for double-stranded DNA molecules that bind to the
target but it has been also used to screen ss DNA
molecules (16,17). SELEX has advantages to the previous
methods but still lacks in its ability for high-throughput
analysis as numerous microarray experiments can be
completed in a single day, thus providing a detailed
analysis of binding-site recognition at an unparalleled
rate.
These techniques made use of non-immobilized ss DNA
in liquid phase to probe ss DNA interactions with other
molecules such as proteins, drugs and ligands, all of which
suﬀered from being time-consuming, laborious, expensive
and incapable of high-throughput screening. Therefore,
oligonucleotides immobilized to solid supports provide an

important tool for the rapid high-throughput examination
of sequence-speciﬁc DNA–protein interactions.
Two current studies (18,19) have used microarrays
displaying all possible 8-mer and 10-mer DNA duplexes to
study eﬀectively the sequence-recognition of both tran-
scription factors and small molecules. These methods
illustrate the potential high-throughput use of k-mer
arrays in examining the DNA–binding properties of
duplex-binding molecules but leave the area of SNABP
speciﬁcity unexplored.
The innovative high-throughput assay described here
provides a parallel screening system for identifying the
speciﬁcity of SNABP binding. The major cold shock
protein from Bacillus subtilis (CspB) was used to develop
this microarray-based assay. This protein inﬂuences
transcription and translation in vitro (20) by binding to
stretches of 6–7 nucleotides (21) of ss DNA with a high
degree of speciﬁcity (21,22).
We have used an oligonucleotide chip, for the identi-
ﬁcation of high-aﬃnity 6-mer binding motifs for CspB.
The chip contains all possible 4096 ss hexadeoxynucleo-
tides incorporated onto a standardized anchor. The
oligonucleotides on the array were originally designed to
hybridize to folded mRNA which requires a signiﬁcant
spacer between the array surface and the recognition
hexamer (Figure D, supplementary).
The use of a competitor protein in this assay allowed the
identiﬁcation of high-aﬃnity DNA-binding sites. The
binding aﬃnity of a competitor protein will limit
the amount of ss DNA-binding sites available to the
CspB. The competitor protein chosen was a single-
stranded DNA-binding protein from the crenarchaeote
Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoSSB). SsoSSB has a molecular
weight of 16 kDa and binds non-speciﬁcally to ss DNA
with a binding density of 5 nt per monomer and an
apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 90 nM (2).
Thus, the competitive binding of the SsoSSB protein
provided a means of identifying high-aﬃnity consensus
binding motifs for CspB by reducing non-speciﬁc and
weak CspB-ss DNA binding.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microchip manufacture
Oligonucleotide chips were supplied by Nyrion Ltd
and contained all possible 4096 ss hexadeoxynucleotides
incorporated into a general structure, 50-NH2-C12-Spacer-
AAAAAAAAAA-NNNNNNNNN-XXXXXX-30, where
N was one of four bases and X was a speciﬁc hexadeoxy-
nucleotide. Each chip is made up of a 4 4 meta-grid
and each of these sub grids contains 18 columns 15 rows
of spots, which are 135mm 15% in diameter.
Oligonucleotides were immobilized to the chip surface
using standard Exiqon amino-link chemistry. All arrays
were manufactured by pin spotting, according to complete
standard commercial practices. This was all done under
contract by MWG Biotech custom arrays. For control
purposes, arrays are batch tested using a standard mRNA
template and a standard QC procedure expected to give a
standard signal. This standard signal serves as a positive
and negative control for all arrays. MWG Biotech spot
biotin on the surface of the array, which also serves as a
negative standard control (generates zero signal).
Expression and purification of recombinant SsoSSB
A mutant version of the SsoSSB protein from the
crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus was constructed by
changing the C-terminal glutamate residue to a cysteine
(E145C mutant), allowing for the incorporation of spin
labels and ﬂuorescent probes on the C-terminal tail.
This mutation minimizes the aﬀect of labelling on
DNA-binding activity as the C-terminal glutamate is not
involved in ss DNA binding. The E145C mutant was
constructed only as a precaution if the amine-reactive
labelling methods were unsuccessful. Protein expression
was induced by addition of 0.2mM IPTG at 378C for 3 h,
after which cells were pelleted and frozen until required.
Cell lysis, centrifugation and chromatography steps were
carried out at 48C. Cells (20 g) were thawed in 50ml lysis
buﬀer (50mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1mM
EDTA, 1mM DTT) and immediately sonicated for
5 1min with cooling. The lysate was centrifuged at
40 000 g for 45min. DNase I [40 mg/ml] and RNase A
[10 mg/ml]) were then added to the cell lysate and
incubated at room temperature for 30min with gentle
agitation. The supernatant was heated to 708C for 30min
in a water bath, and denatured proteins were precipitated
by centrifugation at 40 000 g at 48C. The supernatant was
analysed by SDS–PAGE, and shown to contain recombi-
nant SSB, which migrated as a band of 16 kDa as
expected. The supernatant was diluted 5-fold with buﬀer
A (50mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT)
and applied to a Heparin-Sepharose (Amersham) column
equilibrated with buﬀer A. SsoSSB was eluted over a
linear gradient comprising 0–1M NaCl. Fractions corre-
sponding to a distinct absorbance peak were analysed by
SDS–PAGE, pooled and concentrated. A subsequent gel
ﬁltration step (HR 10/30 Superdex-200) in a buﬀer
containing, 10mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl,
1mM EDTA and 1mM DTT, resulted in essentially
homogeneous SsoSB, as determined by SDS-PAGE
analysis. This method is an adaptation of the previously
published method (23). SsoSSB was concentrated using a
Viva Spin column (MWCO¼ 5 kDa) and quantiﬁed using
both the Bradford method and the theoretical extinction
coeﬃcient, e280 nm¼ 12660M1. cm1.

His6-CspB
Primers B.S_CSP fwd (50-dAGCCATATG TTA GAA
GGT AAA GTA AAA TAA -30) and B.S_CSP rev
(50-dCGGATCC TAA CGC TTC TTT AGT AAC
GTT AGC-30) were used in a PCR with plasmid DNA
(pET11-CspB vector provided by Michael Wunderlich
(University of Bayreuth)) containing the CspB gene.
Bases were added to the primers to introduce the NdeI
and BamHI restriction sites (underlined). These sites
were used to clone the PCR product in NdeI-BamHI-
digested pET28a vector, resulting in the plasmid
pET28a_B.S_CspB.

BL21 (DE3)pLysS Eschericia coli (E. coli) was trans-
formed with pET28_B.S._CspB and transformants were
grown in Luria-Bertani medium, containing 50 mg/ml
kanamycin at 378C with agitation. One-litre cultures
were grown to an OD600 of 0.5–0.7 and IPTG
(isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactosidase) was then added to a
ﬁnal concentration of 1mM. Incubation was then
continued for an additional 5–6 h and the cells were
harvested at 8000 g in a JLA-9.1000 rotor for 12min at
108C. Pellets were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at 808C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis
buﬀer (20mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 500mM NaCl,
0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1mM phenylmethylsulphonyl
ﬂuoride (PMSF), 1mM EDTA and protease inhibitors)
to a ﬁnal volume of 30ml/5 g of cells and then lysed
using a French-press. DNase I [40mg/ml] and RNase A
[10 mg/ml]) were then added to the cell lysate and
incubated at room temperature for 30min with gentle
agitation. As an initial step, the fusion protein was puriﬁed
using a Ni-NTA resin aﬃnity column, as per manufac-
turer’s instructions and then puriﬁed to homogeneity as
described previously (24). Brieﬂy, to remove minor
contaminants the fractions containing His6-CspB were
pooled and dialysed overnight into a buﬀer containing
20mM Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 1mM DTT. The solution was
applied to an HR 5/5 Mono-Q (1ml) anion exchange
column. Bound protein was eluted with a NaCl-gradient
ranging from 0–1M. CspB eluted at a concentration
of 250mM NaCl. A subsequent gel ﬁltration step
(HR 10/30 Superdex-75) in a buﬀer containing 10mM
Tris/HCl pH 7.5 and 100mM NaCl) resulted in visually
pure His6-CspB, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis.
His6-CspB was concentrated using a Viva Spin
column (MWCO¼ 3.5 kDa) and quantiﬁed using both
the Bradford method and the theoretical extinction
coeﬃcient, e280 nm¼ 5690M1. cm1.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Three hundred picomoles of each ss DNA templates were
50-end labelled by incubating templates with 0.03mCi of
[g–32P]ATP, T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 polynucleo-
tide kinase buﬀer in a total volume of 60 ml at 378C for
2.5 h. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation
(30min at 658C). Unincorporated [g–32P]ATP was
removed with QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit
(Qiagen).
For a standard EMSA, 20 pmol of labelled ss DNA was
mixed with increasing amounts of protein (total volume,
18 ml) at 48C for 20min in binding buﬀer (50mM Tris,
pH 8.0, 100mM NaCl) unless stated otherwise. Two
microlitres of dye solution (20% glycerol, 0.034%
bromophenol blue) was added to the samples prior to
gel electrophoresis.
Electrophoresis preformed in TBE (89mM Tris, 89mM
boric acid, 2mM EDTA, pH 8.0) buﬀer through a
non-denaturing acrylamide gel (a 10% or 20% gel was
used depending on the protein; e.g. for 50ml of 20% gel;
25ml of 40% acrylamide, 2.5ml of 10TBE, 0.5ml APS
and 50 ml Temed) at 75V until the samples had entered the
gel and then at 100V at 48C (overnight for a 20% gel and
12 h for a 10% gel). Autoradiographs were obtained by
exposing gels to Kodak BioMax MS ﬁlm for 1–3 h at
room temp.
Labelling of ss DNA-binding proteins with Cy5 dye
In the standard procedure, the contents of 1 vial (‘to label
1mg of protein’) of cyanine 5 (Cy5) mono-functional dye
the contents (Amersham) were dissolved in 50 ml of
anhydrous DMSO. Proteins were dialysed into buﬀer B
(150mM, Na2CO3 (pH 9.3, pH was adjusted with
H3PO4)) and concentrated using a Viva Spin column
(MWCO¼ 5 kDa). Typical working concentrations of
proteins were 1mg/ml, unless stated otherwise. Ten
microlitres of dye/DMSO was pipetted into 200 ml protein
solution under slow vortexing. After a 30-min incubation
at 258C in the dark, the reaction was terminated by the
addition of 300 ml of 100mM NaH2PO4 (to suppress
further labelling) to the sample. To separate the unbound
dye, the sample was loaded onto a PD-10 column (10ml
bed of Sephadex G-25M), which had been pre-equili-
brated in a buﬀer A (100mMNaCl, 50mMNaH2PO4 and
1mM EDTA (pH 7.5, pH adjusted with NaOH). The
column was then washed with buﬀer A (2 1ml) and the
labelled protein was then eluted by adding 2ml of water to
the column. The extent of the modiﬁcation was assessed
using MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry. Protein concen-
tration was determined before and after labelling, Cy5-
protein concentration was calculated as per manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Protein hybridization
Microarrays were pre-wet with phosphate-buﬀered saline
(PBS) and 0.01% Triton X-100 and then blocked in 2%
non-fat dried milk for 1 h. Blocked microarray slides were
washed once with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, and once with
PBS and 0.01% Triton X-100. Protein (Cy5 labelled and
unlabelled) binding to ss 25-mers (containing all possi-
ble [4096] 6-mer sequences) on a generic microchip
was carried out in a hybridization chamber (Camlab,
RTP/7870). Protein binding was performed in a humid
chamber at 48C with 80 ml of protein-binding reaction mix
containing: 50mM KCl, 20mM Tris (pH 8.0), 2% (w/v)
non-fat dried milk, 0.2mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)
and 40 mM of test protein. Slides were covered with a
siliconized cover-slip (BDH cover glass 22 50mm,
Cat. No. 406/0188/42, Borosilicate Glass) and incubated
for 1 h at 48C. The cover-slip was removed and the slide
was washed (3x) in a slide chamber ﬁlled with PBS and
0.05% Tween-20, with PBS and 0.01% Triton X-100 (3)
and once with PBS for 3min each. Excess water was
removed from the slide surface (by ﬂicking), which was
allowed to dry before scanning. This method is an
adaptation of the previously published method (25).
Various methods (denaturing conditions; including high
temperatures, various concentrations of detergents and
pH range in combination with high NaCl concentration)
were used to remove bound protein from the chip surface
in order to reuse the array but were all unsuccessful as
they either had detrimental aﬀects on ONs bound to the
PAGE 3 OF 9 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 10 e75
surface of the array or were unable to remove bound
protein.
Competitive assay
The method was essentially the same as above except that
both His6-CspB and SsoSSB proteins were added to the
binding reaction mix at the speciﬁed molar ratio. The
binding reaction was carried out as before. The array
was then incubated for 1 h in a humid chamber at 48C
with 100 ml of diluted (1:100 in blocking buﬀer) Alexa
532-conjugated polyclonal antibody to His5 (Molecular
Probes). After incubation, the array was washed (3) with
PBS and 0.05% Tween-20 and once with PBS for 3min
each. Excess water was removed from the slide surface
(by ﬂicking), which was allowed to dry before scanning.
Microarray analysis: data collection
All microarray slides were scanned using an ArrayWorx
microarray scanner at a range of laser settings, the highest
of which produced a saturated signal for the majority of
spots. The Alexa-532 (Cy3 equivalent) ﬂuorophore was
excited at 532 nm and the emission was recorded at
570nm. The Cy5 ﬂuorophore was excited at 633 nm and the
emission was recorded at 675 nm. The data were ﬁltered
initially using a series of quality-control criteria so that
only high-quality spots were used in our analysis. For each
array we removed any ﬂagged spots, these were spots that
had dust ﬂakes, scratches and irregular spots (spots that
outmatched the average size). The average size of a spot is
135mm 15% in size, any spot that did not correspond to
this size constraint was excluded from the data. This size
constraint also provided a crude method of approximating
the DNA concentration of each spot, which allowed only
spots with an optimum DNA concentration into the data
collected. All microarray TIF images were quantiﬁed
using Imagene Version 5.0 software.
Microarray analysis: data processing
The extent of background ﬂuorescence was initially deter-
mined from an array experiment using BSA. The level of
background ﬂuorescence from the spots and array surface
was found to be similar. Therefore, the average ﬂuores-
cence between spots on the array surface was used as the
background value throughout the experiments, which was
minimal in comparison to the average signal intensity.
Background subtracted median intensities were calculated
for each spot on the microarray and the data was
normalized according to the total signal intensity, so
that the average spot intensity was the same for each
replicate slide (3). The normalized data of each
competitive array experiment was used to generate a list
of the high-intensity sequences/spots (the highest to lowest
intensity), i.e. spots which were above a threshold level
of intensity (Supplementary Data, Figure Aa). High-
intensity spots/sequences which occurred in all three
replicates were carried forward for further data analysis,
this procedure minimized the occurrence of any false
positives* or negatives* (*False positives¼ spots which
ﬂuoresce highly on one array but not on all three arrays.
Total¼ 6.5%; False negatives¼ spots which did not
ﬂuoresce on one array but ﬂuoresced highly on
two arrays. Total¼ 2%) in the overall data collection.
The average intensity was calculated and the sequences
were ranked accordingly. The list of sequences generated
were condensed to include only the best binding
sequences, these were spots that had intensity above
55% normalized ﬂuorescence and at least 6 standard
deviations away from the global mean intensity
(Figure Ab, Supplementary Data). The ﬁnal list
contained a total of 50 high aﬃnity-binding sequences
for His6-CspB.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
ITC experiments were carried out as described previously
(21) with minor modiﬁcations. Four oligonucleotides were
used for the experiments (Figure 2B), both possibilities of
the consensus-binding sequence (ITC1 and ITC2), a
positive (ITC3(26)) and negative control (ITCcontrol).
Each exothermic heat pulse (Figure 2A, upper panels)
corresponds to an injection of 5 ml of each oligonucleotide
(100 mM) into the cell containing 5 mM CspB at 288C.
Integrated heat data (Figure 2A, lower panels) constitutes
a diﬀerential binding curve, which was ﬁtted to a single-
site binding model to give, the stoichiometry of binding
(N), binding aﬃnity (Kd) and enthalpy of binding (H)
for each heptanucleotide.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Cy5 labelled SsoSSB binds ss DNA
SsoSSB was covalently labelled with the mono-functional
dye Cyanine 5 (Cy5; Amersham). Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays (EMSA) were conducted to verify that SsoSSB
retained its DNA-binding activity subsequent to labelling
with Cy5. A single-stranded 25-mer (ONc:50–
dATCCTACTGATTGGCCAAGGTGCTG-30), labelled
at the 50-end with g-32P, was used to compare the binding
aﬃnity of unlabelled and Cy5-labelled SsoSSB. Figure Cc
(Supplementary Data) shows a gel-shift experiment
performed with ONc in the presence of increasing
amounts of unlabelled (lanes 1–4) or labelled (lanes 5–8)
protein. The similarity in the EMSA for both unlabelled
and Cy5-labelled protein suggests that labelling did not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the binding aﬃnity of the protein. The
double banding seen (Figure Cc, Supplementary Data) is a
result of the gradual dissociation of labelled DNA from
SsoSSB. The fact that previous SsoSSB-ss DNA-binding
studies using ITC have shown that SsoSSB bound to ss
DNA with a ratio of 5 nt/monmer (2) suggests that the
double banding seen in the gel is probably a result of the
EMSA technique used and the on/oﬀ-rates of SsoSSB-ss
DNA complex formation.
SsoSSB-Cy5 binds non-specifically to all ss DNA sequences
A generic chip (Figure D, Supplementary Data)
was constructed, which contained all possible 4096
ss hexadeoxynucleotide sequences found in DNA and
incorporated into a general construct, 50-NH-A10-N9-X6-
30 (X¼G, C, A, or T and the stretch of 9 Ns is composed
e75 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 10 PAGE 4 OF 9
of random bases). The binding of SsoSSB-Cy5 to the
generic chip was analysed and all the spots on the
array ﬂuoresced with similar intensities, consistent with
non-speciﬁc binding of SsoSSB-Cy5 (2).
CspB and His6-CspB have similar affinity for ss DNA
A ss 25-mer (3) (ONc: 50–dATCCTACTGATTGGC
CAAGGTGCTG-30), labelled at the 50-end with g–32P
was used to compare the binding aﬃnities and speciﬁcities
of His6-CspB and CspB. Figure 1A shows a gel-shift
experiment performed for ONc in the presence of
decreasing amounts of His6-CspB (lanes 2–6) and
non-His6-tagged CspB (lane 7). Lanes 3, 4 and 5 show
decreasing migration patterns for the His6-CspB ss DNA
complex as less protein molecules bind. This is most likely
a result of deviation in the aﬃnity of CspB for speciﬁc
binding sites within ONc. The data show that the addition
of the His-tag does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the binding
aﬃnity or speciﬁcity of the protein. The eﬀect of ﬂanking
DNA at the 30 end of the oligonucleotides, on CspB
binding, was also examined by EMSA using a series
of oligonucleotides that were structurally consistent
with the oligonucleotides found on the array; the only
diﬀerence was that a varying number of bases were added

being detected on the surface using alexa 532-conjugated polyclonal antibody to His5. Microarray images shown here were results from two diﬀerent
batches of arrays and proteins. Sub-array three from each competitive protein-binding experiments has been enlarged to highlight the repeated
pattern seen on all arrays. The oligonucleotide, GCACTT, appears as a bright spot on both arrays. The microarrays have been artiﬁcially coloured as

to the 30 end. The results from these experiments show
that ﬂanking bases at the 30 end or a lack of them did
not seem to aﬀect the binding of CspB (T1 and Figure B,
Supplementary Data).
CspB is competitive with SsoSSB
A competitive EMSA was used to show that His6-CspB
binds more strongly than SsoSSB to the previously
reported high aﬃnity Y-box-binding motif (27)
(ATTGG). A 25-mer, ON1 (50–dA19-GATTGG-30),
which contains the Y-box-binding motif, was labelled at
the 50-end with g–32P. ON1 is similar in composition to the
oligonucleotides found on the generic chip. Figure 1B
shows the result of a gel-shift experiment performed with
ON1 in the presence of varying amounts of His6-CspB
and SsoSSB proteins. An intermediate band can be
seen in lane 5, corresponding to the formation of the
His6-CspB-SsoSSB-ON1 complex. This band occurs only
when the SsoSSB/CspB proteins are in a molar ratio of
approximately 1:1.
The competitive binding assay can be transferred to
microarray format
The ﬂuorescent signal from His6-CspB bound to the chip
was analysed (Figure E, Supplementary Data). About
20% of the spots had signals greater than threshold level
(which was set at 40% of the maximum ﬂuorescent signal).
To eliminate weakly bound CspB, an equimolar mixture
(as determined by gel-shift, Figure 1B) of a competitor
SsoSSB, and His6-CspB was incubated with an oligonu-
cleotide chip and bound His6-CspB was detected
(Figure 1C). High-intensity ﬂuorescence spots were
observed in repeated patterns on the arrays, which is
indicative of selective binding aﬃnity (25).
High-affinity motifs identified by microarray analysis, are
validated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and
isothermal calorimetry
An EMSA was carried out to conﬁrm the binding-site
data generated from the oligonucleotide chip analysis. The
high aﬃnity-binding motif, GCACTT, was chosen from
the data (Figure 1C) to examine if the His6-CspB could
compete successfully with the SsoSSB protein for this
binding site. A 25-mer, ON-Microarray test (ON-Mt:50–
dAAAAAAAAAA-GCACTT-AAAAAAAAA-30), con-
taining the high aﬃnity-binding motif was labelled at the
50-end with g–32P.
Figure F (Supplementary Data) shows a gel-shift
experiment performed with ON-Mt in the presence of
varying amounts of His6-CspB and SsoSSB proteins.
An intermediate band (His-Csp-SsoSSB-ONc complex)
can be seen in lanes 3–11 for ON-MTest, indicating that
the CspB protein competed with SsoSSB for binding to
the (microarray determined) high-aﬃnity-binding site,
GCACTT.
The highest intensity spots identiﬁed from the micro-
array analysis indicate that the strongest CspB-binding
sites are pyrimidine rich (Figure Ga, Supplementary
Data). The high incidence of thymine bases within the
high-aﬃnity 6-mer sequences agrees with previous reports
that CspB has a preference for T-rich stretches of ss DNA
(28). The presence of a stretch of 10 adenines in the linker
region of each oligo (Figure Dd, Supplementary Data) is
likely to lead to hairpin formation for T-rich sequences
and may be expected to down weight the occurrence of
poly T sequences. There is indeed a low intensity for
TTTTTN sequences, which may in part be caused by the
formation of such hairpins. Despite this eﬀect, the
averaging procedure still generates a T-rich consensus
sequence. The standard motif alignment method
(Genedoc) was used to align the resulting top ﬁfty
(as described in Materials and Methods) high-aﬃnity
CspB binding sequences (Figure Gb, Supplementary
Data). A sequence alignment window 10 bases in length
was used; only seven (coloured columns) out of those
10 positions are signiﬁcantly (440%) populated. Analysis
of the relative distribution of each base within this
proposed heptanucleotide-binding site gives a CspB
consensus-binding sequence of 50-GTCTTTG/T-30
(Figure 1D and E).
Analysis of the microarray binding results indicates that
CspB can accommodate the binding of a heptanucleotide
with a strong binding preference for cytosine at position 3
and thymine at positions 2, 4 and 6. This is in agreement
with another recent study (26), where the sequence-speciﬁc
binding of heptapyrimidines to CspB was analysed
by tryptophan ﬂuorescence quenching experiments.
Interestingly, the microarray results show that neither
the Y-Box recognition motif (22), 50-ATTGG-30, nor its
reverse complement 50-CCAAT-30, bind strongly to CspB.
The ATTGG sequence has recently been shown to bind
with a low aﬃnity for CspB at 158C (Kd¼ 5.3 mM (29)),
which is similar to the results described here for CspB
binding to sequences containing ATTGG at 48C.
Both variants of the preferential binding sequences
(ITC-1 and ITC-2) were analysed by ITC and gave
binding constants in the low nanomolar range
(Figure 2B). There is an order of magnitude diﬀerence in
the Kds for the oligonucleotides described here and the Kds
described previously (26), for similar/identical oligonu-
cleotides. This is likely due to a diﬀerence in temperature,
buﬀer conditions and the method used (tryptophan
ﬂuorescence quenching). The control sequence
(TTCTTTT-ITC3), used here and in the previous study
allows us to compare and scale the results from the two
methods.
Thus, both the ITC and EMSA results conﬁrm that
the microarray assay does indeed select and identify
tight binding sequences. This screening procedure could,
therefore, be used as a general method for the
rapid identiﬁcation of high-aﬃnity binding sites for
SNABPs.
CspB-cytosine model explains the preference for a cytosine at
position 3
The X-ray structure for CspB has been reported
previously (24). Figure 2C shows the positively charged
face of CspB, highlighting amino acid residues known to
be involved in DNA binding (3). Molecular modelling of

programme WITNOTP, identiﬁed a pocket in the centre
of the DNA-binding face, which provides an ideal shape
and hydrogen-bonding complementarity for binding
cytosine. Three hydrogen bonds are formed between the
docked cytosine base and amino acid side chains Ser31,
His29 and the backbone of Phe27 (Figure 2C), providing
speciﬁcity for cytosine over the other bases.
In the recently published structure of CspB in complex
with hexathymidine (26), the ligand binds to two protein
molecules. The nucleobase of T2, T3 and T4 make contact
with one protein molecule, T5 bridges between protein
molecules and T6 binds to the next protein molecule. The
contacts made by hexathymidine provide the necessary
scaﬀold for the complex to crystallize but the sequence
fails to bind across the face of the CspB protein, as this
sequence lacks the key cytosine nucleobase at position 3
(26), which, as we have shown here, is required for
optimum ss DNA docking (Figure 2).
SNABPs have been reported to activate transcription by
binding to a speciﬁc recognition sequence upstream (30) or
within (31) a promoter, resulting in activation or repres-
sion of transcription. In the present study, CspB of B.
subtilis which is capable of binding single-stranded nucleic
acids (21) and aﬀects expression of over 100 genes under
cold shock conditions (32), was used as the test protein.
Database analysis of the B. subtilis genome reveals
that 89 copies of the consensus-binding sequence
(50-GTCTTTT-30) exist within potential SNABP promoter
regions (100 bases upstream of the ATG start for all
genes), of which only 24 have an assigned function.
The use of an unbiased genomic assay to identify optimal-
binding sequences for SNABPs in vitro, may provide
insight into their role in regulating cellular functions.
The full implications of these sequences on gene expres-
sion and binding of CspB remain to be determined.
