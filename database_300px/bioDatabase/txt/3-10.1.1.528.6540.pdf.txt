ABSTRACT
The binding of SeqA protein to hemi-methylated
GATC sequences (hemi-sites) regulateschromosome
initiation and the segregation of replicated chromo-
some in Escherichia coli. We have used atomic force
microscopy to examine the architecture of SeqA and
the mode of binding of one molecule of SeqA to a pair
of hemi-sites in aqueous solution. SeqA has a bipart-
ite structure composed of a large and a small lobe.
Upon binding of a SeqA molecule to a pair of hemi-
sites, the larger lobe becomes visibly separated into
two DNA binding domains, each of which binds to
one hemi-site. The two DNA binding domains
are held together by association between the two
multimerization domains that make up the smaller
lobe. The binding of each DNA binding domain to a
hemi-site leads to bending of the bound DNA inwards
toward the bound protein. In this way, SeqA adopts
a dimeric configuration when bound to a pair of
hemi-sites. Mutational analysis of the multimerization
domain indicates that, in addition to multimerization
of SeqA polypeptides, this domain contributes to the
ability of SeqA to bind to a pair of hemi-sites and to its
cooperative behavior.
INTRODUCTION
DNA methylation plays key roles in epigenetic regulation
of chromatin assembly, gene expression, development and
differentiation in mammals (1–3). In Escherichia coli, the
adenine residues of GATC sequences on both strands are
methylated at the 6-amino group by Dam methyltransferase
(4,5). Replication of the chromosome generates hemi-
methylated GATC sequences, since the newly synthesized
strand is transiently unmethylated. SeqA protein preferentially
binds to hemi-sites and sequesters them from methylation
by Dam, especially at the origin of chromosomal replication
(oriC), so preventing over-initiation of chromosomal replica-
tion (6–10). SeqA foci appear to be formed in the hemi-
methylated region behind the replication fork and track
the replication fork (11–15). SeqA function is required for
nucleoid organization and proper segregation of replicated
chromosomes (7,11,16,17), and these functions require the
interaction of SeqA with topoisomerase IV, an enzyme that
relaxes negatively and positively supercoiled DNA and dec-
atenates replicated chromosomes (18). Also, SeqA appears
to be involved in maintaining the negative superhelicity of
DNA (16,17).
One molecule of SeqA, as a functional unit, binds to two
hemi-sites that can be separated by up to 31 bp, and induces
bending of the bound DNA (12,19–21). The binding affinity
and extent of bending are maximal when the two hemi-sites
are present on the same side (or phase) of the DNA helix. In
addition, two SeqA molecules can interact cooperatively when
the pairs of hemi-sites to which they are bound are separated
by <30 bp, and as a result their capacity to interact with
another molecule bound at distal hemi-sites is increased
(20,21). This interaction between the bound proteins triggers
further aggregation of free SeqA proteins onto the bound
proteins, leading to the formation of large aggregates that
can be visualized as foci in vivo (11–13).
Gel filtration, sedimentation and chemical cross-linking
experiments have suggested that SeqA behaves as a homotet-
ramer of 21 kDa polypeptides that aggregates reversibly in a
concentration-dependent manner enhanced by the presence of
DNA (22). Trypsin digestion of SeqA protein has revealed that
the N-terminal fragment (residues 1–50) is responsible for
multimerization and aggregation (21,23,24). The structure
of co-crystals of a C-terminal fragment (amino acid residues
51–181) and DNA containing a hemi-site has permitted
localization of the contact sites of SeqA with the hemi-site.

It appears that the narrow major groove and distorted back-
bone structure of a hemi-site contributes to its recognition by
SeqA (25).
Although the structure of co-crystals of the C-terminal
fragment and DNA containing a hemi-site has been resolved,
the structure of the intact SeqA molecule remains unclear. The
properties of the latter differ from those of the C-terminal
fragment in the following respects: SeqA behaves as a mul-
timer, but the fragment as a monomer (22,23); in the presence
of a large excess of competitor DNA, SeqA forms stable
complexes with hemi-methylated DNA, whereas the fragment
does not (21); and finally, even in the absence of competitor
DNA, formation of the fragment–DNA complex requires
a much greater concentration of the participating fragment
than in the case of the SeqA–DNA complex (23,26,27).
These discrepancies led us to determine the structures of
SeqA and of SeqA–DNA complexes by atomic force micro-
scopy (AFM) under physiologically relevant conditions. We
have also shown, by mutational analysis, that the N-terminal
region contributes to the binding of SeqA to a pair of hemi-
sites and to its cooperative binding to multiple hemi-sites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Sources were as follows: restriction enzymes and cloning
enzymes, Promega; [g-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and
poly(dI–dC), Amersham Biosciences; T4 polynucleotide
kinase, New England Biolabs; Pyrobest DNA polymerase
and T4 DNA ligase, Takara; QIAEX II gel extraction kit,
Qiagen; site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene; and
unmethylated and methylated synthetic oligonucleotides,
Genotech. Unless otherwise indicated, additional reagents
were from Sigma.
Proteins
The mutant forms of seqA were constructed by site-directed
mutagenesis as previously described (22). Wild-type SeqA
and its mutants were expressed and purified from W3SQT
[pBAD18-seqA], as previously described (21).
Crude fractions of W3SQT expressing mutant proteins were
prepared according to Lee et al. with minor modifications.
E.coli W3SQT cells harboring the indicated mutations in
pBAD18-seqA were grown in LB medium to an optical density
at 600 nm of 0.4, and L-(+)-arabinose was added to a final
concentration of 0.1%. Three hours later, the cells were har-
vested, suspended in Buffer A [25 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mM
EDTA, 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT] and lysed, and partially
purified fraction II was prepared as described (22). Wild-type
and SeqA(T18G) proteins were further purified by heparin
agarose chromatography; fraction II containing SeqA protein
was diluted 25-fold with Buffer A containing 100 mM KCl and
immediately loaded onto a heparin agarose column equilib-
rated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear
salt gradient up to 1 M KCl. Both wild-type and SeqA(T18G)
protein eluted around 350 mM KCl.
DNAs containing hemi-sites
The sequences of the DNA fragments used are given in Table 1.
The DNA fragments containing four hemi-methylated sites
with variable spacing between the second and third hemi-
sites were prepared from plasmids described previously (20).
Atomic force microscopy
Bioscope AFM images were obtained with a Nanoscope IIIa
controller (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) using the
tapping mode in an aqueous environment. The cantilevers had
oxide-sharpened silicon nitride tips (Digital Instruments) with
a nominal spring constant of 0.32 N/m. The resonance fre-
quency in the aqueous environment was set at 8.5 – 0.3 kHz,
and the microscope was operated at drive amplitudes between
50 and 500 kHz. AFM images (512 · 512 pixels) were col-
lected at a scan speed of 0.8–2.1 Hz, and image analyses were
performed with Nanoscope version 4.32 software (Digital
Instruments).
Gel shift assays
Unless otherwise indicated, the 20 ml reaction mixtures con-
tained 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM DTT, 1 mg of poly(dI–dC), 10% glycerol, 5 mg of BSA,
and 2 fmol of hemi-methylated DNA together with the
specified amount of SeqA protein. The mixtures were incub-
ated for 15 min at 32C, and the subsequent steps have been
described (9).
RESULTS
Binding of SeqA to hemi-sites induces conformational
changes in both SeqA and DNA
AFM has been used to study biological processes such as
protein dynamics and DNA–protein interactions in aqueous
media (28–30). We used AFM in tapping mode to examine the
structure of SeqA in a buffer solution in the absence of DNA
(Figure 1). In the tapping mode, the oscillating tip only touches
the sample at the end of its downward movement, thereby
reducing the contact time and the frictional forces. Compared
with the contact mode of AFM, the tapping mode causes less
damage to samples in liquid media. Most of the images of
SeqA bound to the mica surface were uniformly of bipartite
structures of similar size, with a large lobe (or domain) linked
to a smaller one, and there appeared to be a groove in the large
lobe (arrow in Figure 1B). SeqA aggregates in a reversible,
concentration-dependent manner (22). To observe these aggre-
gates, we increased the SeqA concentration on the mica 4-fold
(Figure 1C). This resulted in oligomeric structures in which
two or more bipartite structures were stacked repetitively in
the same direction. Even at lower SeqA concentrations than
that used in Figure 1A, no forms smaller than bipartite struc-
tures were observed. These results indicate that the bipartite
structure is the functional unit of SeqA.
The AFM image of 75 bp DNA containing two hemi-sites
was linear with an average contour length of 29.8 – 2.5 nm
(Figure 1D). Although the limit of resolution caused by the tip
radius (<20 nm) did not allow accurate measurements, the
estimated length is in fairly good agreement with the expected
value of 25.5 nm for B-DNA (0.34 nm/bp) and with previous
measurements by AFM (31,32).
In SeqA complexes with 75 bp DNA containing two hemi-
sites separated by 21 bp, the large lobe appeared to be bound to

the DNA, linked to the smaller lobe (Figure 2A). The grooves
in the complexes were wider than in free SeqA (Figure 1B) and
the unbound regions of the bound DNA looked like a pair of a
‘duck’s web feet’ connected to two ‘legs’ separated by the
groove in the large lobe. The distance between the two ends
of the bound DNA was 20.4 – 1.9 nm, compared with
29.8 – 2.5 nm for the free DNA, pointing to a conformational
change, a bending, of the bound DNA. The most frequent
bending angle of the bound DNA was 55–59 (Figure 2B),
and the DNA was bent inwards towards the bound protein.
The binding of one molecule of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites
and the bending of the bound DNA agree with previous
conclusions from gel-shift experiments (20–22). SeqA
complexes with DNA containing one hemi-site were barely
detectable by AFM.
Dimeric configuration of SeqA protein
DNA with an 11 bp spacing between the two hemi-sites res-
ulted in SeqA complexes that differed from the 21 bp spacing
DNA–SeqA complexes (Figure 2C). The location of two
hemi-sites towards one end of the 75 bp DNA (nucleotide
numbers of 44–47 and 55–58) permitted the unbound region
to be distinguished from the bound region and the bound
SeqA appeared to be more compact than when bound to the
21 bp spacing DNA.
When the spacing between the two hemi-sites was increased
to 31 bp (Figure 2D), the large lobe of SeqA that was bound to
the 31 bp spacing DNA was split into two domains that were
bound to different points on the DNA. The increase in spacing
resulted in a less compacted structure of the bound SeqA as
depicted in Figure 2F. The similar mobility of the SeqA
complexes formed with DNAs with different spacing of the
two hemi-sites (20) eliminates the possibility that two separate
molecules of SeqA bind to the DNA when there is 31 bp
spacing. Instead, this result shows that the large lobe of each
SeqA molecule actually consists of two DNA binding domains
each of which binds to a hemi-site; the small lobe was also split
with a cleft between the two parts.
When two hemi-sites were separated by 16 bp they faced in
opposite directions on the helix. SeqA bound to 16 bp spacing
DNA had a structure different from that bound to 11 or 21 bp
spacing DNA (Figure 2E): the large lobe was lengthened and
the small lobe split in two. SeqA has the highest affinity for
DNA with the 21 bp spacing followed by the 11, 31 and 16 bp
spacing (20), indicating that it achieves the most favorable
structure with the 21 bp spacing DNA.
Both SeqA and its N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–50)
eluted as a tetramer in gel-filtration studies (22,24). Chemical
cross-linking experiments showed that pairs of monomers of
SeqA are closely associated. Hence, we have proposed that the
SeqA molecule is composed of two dimers (20–22). A recent
crystal structure revealed that the N-terminal fragment is
a dimer that oligomerizes to form a filament (24). These
observations agree with our finding that SeqA has a bipartite
structure and oligomerizes on one direction (Figure 1).

Taken together these results suggest that SeqA is a dimer of
two 21 kDa polypeptides, not a tetramer. The tetrameric
behavior of SeqA protein observed in previous experiments
may have been a consequence of the extended, non-globular
structure of SeqA.
The AFM structures of the SeqA bound to DNA, especially
those obtained with the 31 bp spacing DNA, thus reveal that
the large lobe actually contains two DNA binding regions and
the small lobe two multimerization sites. The latter become
associated and serve as an anchor that supports the dimeric
configuration of SeqA. Amino acids 71–181 region of SeqA
form a hemi-site binding domain and the 51–70 region forms a
flexible hinge region (23,27). The N-terminal fragment
containing amino acid residues 1–50 is responsible for
multimerization. We also propose that the DNA binding and
multimerization domains in the AFM structures correspond to
the C-terminal region (amino acids 71–181) and N-terminal
region (amino acids 1–50), respectively, with the two domains
connected by a flexible hinge region (amino acids 51–70).
Thr-18 in the multimerization domain is necessary for
cooperative binding of SeqA to hemi-methylated DNA
We have identified the amino acids participating in the inter-
action between SeqA molecules by bacterial two-hybrid
analysis with randomly mutagenized seqA (22). One of the
mutated proteins defective in the interaction had Thr-18
replaced by Gly (data not shown). We have analyzed the
binding of SeqA(T18G) to hemi-sites (Figure 3). Because
one SeqA molecule binds to a pair of hemi-sites, both wild-
type SeqA and SeqA(T18G) formed a complex with DNA
containing two hemi-sites (Figure 3A), and their affinity for

the DNA was similar. Binding of the wild-type and mutant
proteins to DNAs harboring four hemi-sites with 16 or 19 bp
spacing between the pairs of hemi-sites generated an addi-
tional slow-mobility complex formed by the binding of two
SeqA molecules (20,21) (Figure 3B and C). However
SeqA(T18G) formed much less of this complex and the latter
migrated more slowly. We have shown that two SeqA
molecules bind cooperatively to DNA with <30 bp spacing
between pairs of hemi-sites, but independently to DNA with
>30 bp spacing (20). It is this cooperative binding that is more
efficient with wild-type SeqA than with SeqA(T18G) and that
generates a faster moving slow-mobility complex. On the
other hand, with the DNA with pairs of hemi-sites spaced
41 bp apart, the wild-type and mutant proteins formed similar
amounts of the slow-mobility complexes and these migrated
with the same speed (Figure 3D), and the absence of cooper-
ative binding of SeqA to the 41 bp spaced DNA reduced
formation of the slow-mobility complex. Evidently, SeqA
requires Thr-18 in the multimerization domain for cooperative
binding to hemi-methylated GATC sequences.

Glu-5, Asp-7 and Glu-9 of the multimerization domain
contribute to proper binding of SeqA to a pair
of hemi-sites
The N-terminus of SeqA has abundant negatively charged
amino acids: Glu-5, Asp-7, Asp-8 and Glu-9 (7). We substi-
tuted each of these amino acids with lysine (K), and examined
the binding of the resulting proteins to hemi-methylated DNA
(Figure 4). While SeqA(E5K), (D8K) and (E9K) bound to
DNA containing a pair of hemi-sites with similar affinity to
wild-type protein, SeqA(D7K) and SeqA(E5, 9K) lost their
binding ability (Figure 4A). When we tested cooperative bind-
ing of the mutant proteins to DNA containing two pairs of
hemi-sites with 16 bp spacing (Figure 4B), SeqA(D7K)
formed less of the complexes than the other proteins and
favored the slow-mobility complex over the fast-mobility
complex, and SeqA(E9K) also formed more of the slow-
mobility complex than the fast-mobility complex (20).
SeqA(E5,9K) did not form stable complexes with this DNA
on its own, but was able to bind cooperatively when mixed
with wild-type or other mutant SeqA proteins (20). When the
spacing between the two hemi-sites was increased to 32 bp,
SeqA(D7K) no longer formed a slow-mobility complex
(Figure 4C). These results indicate that cooperative interaction
between SeqA(D7K) molecules permits SeqA(D7K) to form
slow-mobility complexes with 16 bp spacing DNA.
It thus appears that SeqA(D7K) and SeqA(E5,9K) possess
a defect in forming a complex with DNA containing two
hemi-sites, but that cooperative interaction between the mutant
Figure 3. The Thr-18 of SeqA contributes to cooperative interaction between
SeqA molecules. The binding behavior of purified wild-type SeqA and
SeqA(T18G) was analyzed by gel shift experiments: 10, 20 and 40 ng of
wild-type SeqA (designated as WT) and SeqA(T18G) were incubated with
P32-labeled DNA containing a pair of hemi-sites, which were separated by
16 bp (A), and two pairs of hemi-sites in which the pairs were separated by
16 bp (B), 19 bp (C) and 41 bp (D). Complexes of SeqA and DNA were
separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels, dried and visualized by autoradiography.

hemi-sites, but interact cooperatively. Fractions containing mutant SeqA
proteins were incubated with DNA containing a pair of hemi-sites separated
by 21 bp (A), with DNA containing four hemi-sites with a 16 bp spacing
between the pairs of hemi-sites (B) and DNA containing four hemi-sites with
32 bp spacing (C). In each experiment, 33 and 100 ng of wild-type SeqA
(designated as WT) and SeqA(E5K), (D7K), (E8K), (E9K) and (E5,9K)
partially purified fractions were added to the reaction. The amount of SeqA
protein in each case was similar in western blot (data not shown).

proteins themselves (Figure 4B) or with other proteins (20)
permits them to form a complex with the DNA containing four
hemi-sites. This suggests that the mutant proteins recognize
pairs of hemi-sites, but cannot form stable complexes with
them. Hence, we conclude that Glu-5, Asp-7 and Glu-9 are
needed for proper binding of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites.
DISCUSSION
The binding of a SeqA molecule to a pair of hemi-sites sep-
arated by up to three helical turns (31 bp) (13,21) of the DNA
suggests that the conformation of SeqA is flexible. The free
SeqA proteins observed by AFM were homogeneous in
appearance with a groove of constant width in the large
lobes (Figure 1). No free molecules with split DNA binding
domains were observed, such as the complexes with 31 bp
spacing DNA (Figure 2). These observations exclude the pos-
sibility that, prior to DNA binding, the free SeqA molecules
are a mixture of conformations with the two DNA binding
domains at different distances from one another and that
different molecules in the population bind to differently
spaced hemi-sites. Instead we suggest that, since the C-
terminal domains of SeqA are able on their own to bind to
a hemi-site with a low affinity (23,26,27), the transient binding
of one of the two DNA binding domains to a hemi-site causes a
conformational change of the molecule that allows the other
DNA binding domain to make contact with an unbound hemi-
site, as depicted in Figure 5.
The extended conformation of SeqA bound to two hemi-
sites on a linear DNA molecule is stabilized by bending
the region between the two hemi-sites. Increasing the spac-
ing between two hemi-sites to three helical turns results in
greater separation of the DNA binding domains of the SeqA
(Figure 2). Presumably, it is for this reason that SeqA has a
lower affinity for 31 bp spacing DNA than for 21 bp spacing
(20) and is not able to bind to DNA with hemi-sites spacing of
more than 31 bp (12). These results suggest either that its two
DNA binding domains cannot reach two hemi-sites separated
by more than three helical turns, or that SeqA has limited space
into which to fit the bent DNA, or both. The distortion of SeqA
that accompanies its binding to hemi-sites on opposite sides of
the DNA helix accounts for its preference for hemi-sites on the
same side (Figure 2E).
A SeqA molecule bound to a pair of hemi-sites can interact
cooperatively with another SeqA molecule bound to an adja-
cent pair of hemi-sites (20,21). The cooperative interaction
between the bound molecules enhances their capacity for
interaction and permits them to interact with another SeqA
molecule bound to distal hemi-sites. This step-wise interaction
is followed by aggregation of free SeqA proteins onto the
bound proteins. Thus, SeqA possesses three distinct and con-
secutive biochemical properties: binding to a pair of hemi-
sites, cooperative binding to two or more pairs of sites and
aggregate formation.
We have shown that Glu-5, Asp-7 and Glu-9 are required for
proper binding of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites (Figure 4), and
that Thr-18 is necessary for cooperativity (Figure 3). The
N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–50) is responsible for
aggregation of SeqA proteins onto long hemi-methylated
DNA (21) as well as the multimerization of individual
SeqA polypeptides to form a multimer (23). Thus, the
multimerization domain influences many aspects of the bio-
chemical behavior of SeqA protein: multimerization of SeqA
polypeptides, proper binding of the DNA binding domain to a
pair of hemi-sites, cooperative binding to multiple hemi-sites
and aggregation onto hemi-methylated DNA.
The GATC sequences that become transiently hemi-
methylated upon DNA replication are distributed with variable
spacing between the sequences in E.coli genome (12). The
flexible dimeric configuration of SeqA and its cooperative and
aggregation properties permit it to interact with the diversely
spaced hemi-sites. In this way, SeqA can perform its roles in
DNA replication: the regulation of chromosome initiation,
formation of foci, maintenance of negative superhelicity
and segregation of the replicated DNA.
Figure 5. Binding of a SeqA to a pair of hemi-methylated GATC sequences.
The binding of one of the DNA binding domains of a SeqA molecule to a hemi-
site leads to conformational change of the molecule that allows the other DNA
binding domain to bind to an adjacent hemi-site within 32 bp. Binding is
stabilized by bending the bound DNA.
