ABSTRACT
We report here the results of a systematic search
for the existence and prevalence of potential intra-
molecular G-quadruplex forming sequences in the
human genome. We have also examined the tendency
for particular sequences of ‘loop’ regions to occur in
particular positions with respect to the G-tracts in a
quadruplex. Using arithmetic ratio and probability
techniques we have discovered frequent and system-
atic occurrence of certain sequence types, the most
prominent being a potential quadruplex contain-
ing CCTGT in the first ‘loop’ position. Being able to
highlight types of potential quadruplex sequences
in G-rich regions is an important step in searching
for biologically relevant sequences and finding their
function.
INTRODUCTION
Four-stranded G-quadruplex structures are the resultant of
the folding of guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences (1–3) into
higher-order structures. They can form most readily from a
single strand of nucleic acid, as at the 30 end of telomeric DNA
(4–9). They can also be extruded from double stranded DNA
(10), especially under the influence of a small-molecule ligand
such as the porphyrin molecule TMPyP, which binds prefer-
ably to some quadruplexes rather than duplex DNA, pushing
the equilibrium to the former structure (11–13). Some of these
quadruplex sequences have been considered as potential thera-
peutic targets for small molecules since they have been repor-
ted to occur within the regulatory regions of several oncogenes
(1). A well-studied example is the G-rich promoter element
of the c-myc oncogene, for which G-quadruplex formation
has been suggested as a molecular switch for gene expression
(11–16). This quadruplex is exceptionally stable, and is readily
formed in preference to remaining in a duplex structure, at
least within short DNA sequences.
In this paper, we have started to address the use of
bioinformatics tools, and in the accompanying one from our
collaborators (17), the more general question of the number
and nature of putative quadruplex sequences within the human
(and other) genome(s). Such sequences, and the individual
quadruplex structures, may be novel targets for therapeutic
intervention, analogous to the selective interference with
telomere maintenance by molecules that bind to and stabilize
telomeric DNA quadruplexes (18–22). Structural data on
quadruplexes is as yet relatively sparse; however, those struc-
tures that are known, from X-ray crystallography and NMR
studies, show a wide diversity of features (7,9,16,23–26).
We have carried out a survey of all possible short quad-
ruplex sequences in the human genome and have attempted
to identify some of the most commonly occurring sequences.
Our analysis of these sequences has highlighted some motifs,
which stand out as being in a separate class from the rest of
the potential quadruplexes, and therefore may have an import-
ant function. Categorization of short sequences like quad-
ruplexes within the human genome is not straightforward.
Unlike conventional gene sequences, the differences between
the sequences is not large but is rather a continuum where, for
example, trying to isolate a sequence or family of sequences on
the grounds of uniqueness is difficult since there are always
many very similar sequences that occur with similar frequen-
cies. The number of combinations of bases that are possible for
loop sequences of the size that we are considering is similar
to the number of distinct loop sequences that exist (Table 1).
Because there are no islands of unique sequence as such,
finding correlations between possible quadruplex and function
is made more difficult.
It has been demonstrated that the stability and the folding
topology of a quadruplex is dependent on the sequence of the
loop regions (27–29). Therefore, we would expect trends in the
sequence of the loops derived from a genome-wide survey of
potential quadruplex sequences to reflect the relative stability
and possibly the functionality of a particular sequence. Trends
in loop sequence were discovered here through inequalities
in the distribution of sequences across each of the three loop
regions within a quadruplex sequence, i.e. examining whether

a particular sequence occurs more in the first, second or third
loops. It is important to emphasize that in the absence of
appropriate biophysical, biochemical and structural data, we
can only assign sequences as being putative quadruplex-
forming. Indeed the available evidence (28) strongly suggests
that many such sequences do not actually form stable
quadruplexes.
METHODS
We define a potential quadruplex sequence as a sequence with
four runs of guanine between three and five bases long, sep-
arated by regions of DNA, which we will call here loop regions
L1, L2 and L3, containing between one and seven bases that
may or may not themselves contain guanines. The lengths of
each of these were restrained for practical reasons (an arbitrary
cut-off of a maximum loop-length of 7 nt had to be applied
because a loop unrestrained in length would make searching
for sequences difficult) and also because of the evidence to date
(29) that quadruplexes exist as short nucleic acid sequences.
We thus define a general quadruplex sequence as
G35 NL1 G35 NL2 G35 NL3 G35‚
where NL1–3 are loops of unknown length, although within the
limits 1 < NL1–3 < 7 nt.
The examination of the distribution of loop sequence was
carried out in several different ways:
(i) The total number of times that a particular loop sequence
appears.
(ii) The distribution of loop sequences with respect to loop
position, by taking a particular loop sequence and
examining the number of times that it occurred in each
loop position, NL1, NL2 or NL3. We then looked at the
ratio between the highest and lowest values for these
populations.
(iii) The probability of a given distribution in each of the
three loops occurring, given an equal likelihood of each
sequence occurring in each loop region L1, L2 or L3.
It is possible for a single sequence to have a number of
different quadruplex topologies (Figure 1) and several differ-
ent isomers of a sequence fold may lend stability to the system.
Not only are there a number of distinct quadruplex fold motifs
that have been identified by X-ray crystallography and NMR,
but there can be a number of choices about which nucleo-
tides in a quadruplex sequence are members of the G-quartet
and which are within loop regions. This complicates the
analysis of the loop distribution since not only is it impossible
to determine the ‘correct’ choice of bases for each loop region
from just sequence data but the same sequence could at least in
principle be involved in different alternative and dynamic
structures. To overcome some of these difficulties we have
used two distinct sets of data. In the first instance, we include
all the sequences that could be considered as belonging to
loop regions. In some cases this can include many over-
lapping sequences. However this data will contain some
loop sequences, which may otherwise be missed out of the
second dataset. In the second case, we have included only
sequences that do not overlap with one another. In order to
overcome some of the ambiguity illustrated in Figure 1a, we
have removed leading and trailing guanines, and loops that
consisted of guanines only were reduced to a single G.

(Perl API). The Ensembl tables were then compiled into the
relational database program MySQL.
The database was searched for quadruplex sequences in two
steps. First, Ensembl Perl API was used to extract assembled
lengths of 2 000 000 bases, which were then searched for
potential quadruplex sequences using a C++ program deve-
loped by A. K. Todd. A list of all combinations of loop length
(1–7 nt) and guanine run length (3–5 nt) was generated
and each was compared against the total genomic sequence.
The results were broken down into the following fields:
(i) individual chromosome, (ii) position in the chromosome,
(iii) function (intron, exon or other), (iv) sequence of the
extracted loop regions and (v) strand on which the hit
occurred. The results were then compiled into mySQL tables
and added to our local implementation of the Ensembl
database. This set of tables included all potential quadruplex
sequences including those where a region of DNA could
contain more than one potential quadruplex sequence. This
raw data is available on request from alan.todd@ulsop.ac.uk
As demonstrated in Figure 1, a single sequence may have
more than one possible quadruplex folding topology. Also
more than one loop sequence for a particular loop position
L1, L2 or L3 may be possible. We will refer to these problems
as quadruplex fold ambiguity. An arbitrary choice of a quad-
ruplex sequence will bias the results of many types of analyses
of quadruplex. However, it may also be necessary for finding
the number of times a particular motif occurs. Therefore,
we have examined our data in two ways. First, a list of
loop sequences was compiled, which included overlapping
sequences and all possible choices of loop region. We will
refer to this as the un-restricted dataset. A second list was also
generated in which the quadruplex motif was found but this
time, if overlapping sequences occurred, only the first one
encountered would be considered. This list was further modi-
fied by removing any leading or trailing guanines from the
loop sequence, as these would otherwise lead to ambiguity in
the loop sequence. This also prevented the inclusion of a
particular loop region more than once in the list. Where
loop regions were made up entirely of guanines, these were
reduced to a single guanine base. This will be referred to as the
arbitrary dataset.
Data analysis
The contents of datasets were ranked in the following way:
(i) By overall loop composition for each hit.
(ii) By the number of times each loop sequence occurs.
(iii) By population of loop position:
(a) By looking at the number of times each particular loop
sequence occurs in each loop position and finding the
ratio between the maximum and minimum of these
populations. Where there was a population of 0 this
was counted as 1.
(b) By probability of loop distribution, given an equal
likelihood that a quadruplex sequence can occur in
each of the loops.
Calculating probability scores
Given an equal likelihood that a particular loop sequence can
be found in any of the three loop positions, the probability that
a loop distribution [a, b or c] occurs is given by the equation
P ¼ a þ b þ cð Þ!
a!b!c!3aþbþc
‚ 1
where a,b and c represent the observed populations of a
particular sequence in loop positions L1, L2 and L3, respect-
ively. Because of the impracticality of working with the very
large numbers that are generated when using factorials we
need to work in log space, so for our probability score the
negative log of the probability was calculated as in Equation 2:
log P ¼ a þ b þ cð Þlog 3 þ

n¼1
log n þ

Therefore the higher the score, the less probable the distri-
bution. Derivations of Equations 1 and 2 are based on an
exercise in reference (31), and are given in the Supplementary
Material.
Two types of quadruplex sequences which stood out, those
which contained CCTGTT and CCTGTCA in the first loop,
were selected from the database and multiple sequence align-
ment of these two quadruplex sequence types were carried out
using CLUSTAL W version 1.85 (32). Figure 2, which shows
the consensus sequences containing them, was generated with
the program MakeLogo (33). The data used in constructing
Figure 2 is available in the Supplementary Material.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 1 gives a summary of the number of quadruplexes in both
datasets. A large number of potential quadruplex sequences
were found on the initial search, which was reduced by
15-fold when the overlapping sequences were rejected
(5713900 ! 375157). The number of distinct (i.e. unique)
quadruplexes is similarly reduced, from 3166800 to 226157;
each quadruplex sequence occurs only once in this category.
Table 1 also shows that some loop sequence combinations
were not detected since the number of unique sequences
that were observed is less than the total number possible.
Overall, 375157 putative quadruplex sequences have been
located in the genome. This agrees remarkably well with the
estimate of 376 000 by a distinct approach (17). Tables 2 and 3
represent two ways in which the arbitrary dataset has been
examined to search for inequalities in the distribution of
sequences by loop position, ranked by ratio and probability
respectively, and show the top 40 occurrences in each
set. Tables 4 and 5 are the corresponding tables for the
un-restricted dataset.
Distribution of loop sequence by position
Unusual distributions are easier to spot for longer loop
sequences. This is because there is a much lower probability
that these longer sequences would occur by chance than a short
one or two base sequences. Since low populations have a
major effect on the ratio, simply looking at the ratio between
the populations in each loop position highlights sequences that
have a low population in one of the positions (Table 2).

The differences between Tables 2 and 4 show the merits
of using both data sets. e.g. the highest ratio in Table 4
(TAGCATT) occurs in 14th place in Table 2. This difference
is because the sequences in which TAGCATT occur are very
G-rich and have many possible choices of loop sequence so
although the un-restricted dataset is an unbiased choice of loop
sequence Table 4 artificially raises the population of some
sequences. In both tables the most commonly occurring motifs
contain CCTGT or CCTAT in the first loop position with
CCTGTCA the most frequent and CCTGTT the next most
frequent.
The number of possible sequences for a stretch of DNA is
equal to 4N where N is the number of bases. This means that
there are fewer sequences for a population to be distributed
across for shorter loops. The shorter the sequence, the fewer
the number of changes required to distribute the population
across the spectrum of possible sequences. As a result the
only sequences that occur infrequently in any given loop posi-
tion are the longer sequences. We find therefore that using a
ratio of populations does not highlight short sequences.
The probability technique that we used, greatly reduces this
bias towards long sequences, with Tables 3 and 5 showing that
guanine-rich sequences with single A and T bases have the
least probable distribution.
Several sequences occur in both the ratio tables (Tables 2
and 4) and the probability tables (Tables 3 and 5); ATCTCCA
and CCTTGGC tend to occur in the third loop position and
many of the CCTGT which tend to occur on the first loop
position.
The most frequently occurring loops are those containing
single A and single T bases, as seen in Table 6, which one
derived from the arbitrary dataset. Study of these quadruplex
sequences and surrounding DNA reveals that there are large
G-rich regions interspersed with single A or T bases. The
c-myc sequence (11,13) is a member of this type.
CCTGT sequences
The CCTGT sequences were examined in more detail because
they were the logical choice to illustrate certain aspects of the
sequences that come to light when looking at quadruplexes in

of times each base appeared in that position.

such a way. Although, it may not necessarily be representative
of the sequences that our methods have flagged, it is useful
in an illustrative capacity. Although some sequences may be
rigidly conserved throughout, the CCTGT type, shows a
degree of variability. In order to determine whether the rest
of the sequences that had the CCTGT motif in the first loop
were consistent in the rest of the quadruplex we extracted all of
the CCTGT sequences from the arbitrary dataset and ranked
them by population. Table 7 shows the top 40 sequences.
There were 3524 sequences that contained CCTGT in one of
the loop regions. The most common loop sequences were T for
the second loop and CTA for the third loop, both of which
occur in Table 5. Looking at the whole table we see a large

variability in quadruplex sequences that contain CCTGT. Only
the top 526 sequences occur more than once, which leaves
2998 unique sequences. This variability makes it difficult
to find a consensus sequence that contains non-guanines in
the second loop. However, the most commonly occurring
sequences are very similar.
Consensus sequences were generated from the multiple
sequence alignments of the quadruplex sequences that con-
tained CCTGTT and CCTGTCA in the first loop (Figures 2a
and b, respectively). The variability of the second loop and the
length of the G-runs surrounding it result in a somewhat
incoherent result for the consensus sequence. The consensus
sequences for both of these types have only two regions that do
not contain guanines. For the CCTGTT type sequences the
third loop has the sequence CTA, which is consistent with the
most commonly occurring CCTGT type sequence shown in
Figure 2a. For the CCTGTCA type sequence the third loop has
a similar sequence, CT, which also features highly in the most
frequently occurring overall sequences.
We have also examined where the CCTGTT and CCTGTCA
sequences occurred with respect to DNA function (Table 8).
The relative distributions of CCTGTT and CCTGTCA appear
to be similar, whereas the distribution of these two subsets is
different from the distribution when all quadruplex sequences
are considered. Not only is the proportion of CCTGTT and
CCTGTCA quadruplex sequences within genes markedly
lower than for the overall quadruplex population but also
there seems to be a larger number on the minus strand,
suggestive that these sequences could form RNA secondary
structures (34) which would, in some cases be undesirable.
Despite variability in the loop sequences that the CCTGT-
type potential quadruplex structures show, they frequently
occur in the context of quadruplex sequence and this may
be evidence of quadruplex structure. Our analysis shows
that there are a large number of sequences in the human
genome, many of which occur systematically, which could
potentially form G-quadruplexes. We have demonstrated
that it is possible to use sequence data alone to isolate unique
sequence types within these. Further sequence analyses are
possible and with the knowledge we can begin to interpret
experimental evidence, e.g. correlate location of quadruplex
sequences with RNA expression levels. We may also be able
to correlate the occurrence of particular quadruplex sequence
types by proximity to particular families of proteins.
