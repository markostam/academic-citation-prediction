Thin elastic shells with variable thickness
for lithospheric flexure of one-plate planets

Abstract
Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the lithosphere,
or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by mantle convection. In both
cases the response of the lithosphere to external forces can be calculated with the theory of
thin elastic plates or shells. On one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric
shell plays an important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the assumption
of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity and topography data
suggest large variations in the thickness of the lithosphere. In this article we obtain the
scalar flexure equations governing the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable
thickness or variable Young’s modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession,
except for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the transverse
deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include bottom loading generated by
mantle convection, we extend the method of stress functions to include loads with a toroidal
tangential component. We further show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs
if the shell thickness varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that
the degree-one harmonic component of the transverse deflection is independent of the elastic
properties of the shell and that it is determined by the global equilibrium of external forces.
The flexure equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the prediction
of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the construction of stress maps
in tectonic analysis.
1 Introduction
Terrestrial planets are flattened spheres only at first sight: close-up views reveal a rich topog-
raphy with unique characteristics for each planet. Unity in diversity is found by studying the
support mechanism for topographic deviations from the hydrostatic planetary shape. A simple
mechanism, called isostasy, postulates mountains floating with iceberg-like roots in the higher
density mantle. Another simple mechanism assumes that mountains stand on a rigid membrane
called the mechanical lithosphere. The two simple models predict very different gravity signals,
from very weak in the first to very strong in the second. The truth lies in-between: an encom-
passing model views topographic structures as loads on an elastic shell with finite rigidity, called
1
the elastic lithosphere (the elastic lithosphere is a subset of the mechanical lithosphere). The
rigidity depends on the elastic properties of the rocks and on the apparent elastic thickness of the
lithosphere. The latter parameter is the main objective of many studies, since its value can be
related to the lithospheric composition and temperature. Another important application of the
model of lithospheric flexure is the determination of stress maps, which can then be compared
with the observed distribution of tectonic features.
Besides the important assumption of elasticity, the model of lithospheric flexure is often
simplified by two approximations. The first one states that the area to be analyzed is suffi-
ciently small so that the curved lithospheric shell can be modeled as a flat plate. The second
approximation states that the shell (or plate) is thin, which means that deformations are small
and that the elastic thickness is small with respect to the wavelength of the load.
On Earth, the model of lithospheric flexure has been very successful for the understanding
of the topography of the oceanic plates, whereas the analysis of continental plates is fraught
with difficulties due to the very old and complex structure of the continents. As far as we know,
plate tectonics do not occur at the present time on other terrestrial planets, which are deemed
one-plate planets [Solomon , 1978], although the term single-shell would fit better because of
the curvature. A single shell can support loads of much larger extent and greater weight, the
best example of which is the huge Tharsis volcanic formation covering a large portion of Mars.
Indeed such a load cannot be supported by the bending moments present in a thin flat plate,
whereas it can be supported by the stresses tangent to the shell: the shell acts as a membrane.
The first application of thin shell theory to a planet was done by Brotchie and Silvester
[1969] for the lithosphere of the Earth (see also Brotchie [1971]). However the approximation of
flat plate theory was seen to be sufficient when it was understood that the lithosphere of the Earth
is broken into several plates [Tanimoto, 1998]. Brotchie and Silvester [1969] do not consider
tangential loads and their flexure equation only includes dominant terms in derivatives; their
equation is thus a special case of the equations of Kraus [1967] and Vlasov [1964] discussed below.
Thin shell theory was then applied to the Moon by Solomon and Head [1979], by Turcotte et al.
[1981] and later by Arkani-Hamed [1998], Sugano and Heki [2004] and Crosby and McKenzie
[2005].
On Mars, the dominance of the Tharsis rise in the topography led to numerous applications
of the theory of thin elastic shells to lithospheric flexure. Turcotte et al. [1981] studied the tran-
sition between bending and membrane regimes. Willemann and Turcotte [1982] analyzed the
lithospheric support of Tharsis. Sleep and Phillips [1985] analyzed the membrane stress distribu-
tion on the whole surface. Banerdt et al. [1992], Banerdt and Golombek [2000] and Phillips et al.
[2001] used a model of lithospheric flexure including membrane support, bending stresses and
tangent loads [Banerdt , 1986] in order to study the global stress distribution. Arkani-Hamed
[2000] and Johnson et al. [2000] determined the elastic thickness beneath large volcanoes and
beneath the North Polar Cap, respectively. Using local admittance analysis with spatiospectral
methods, McGovern et al. [2002] determined the elastic thickness at various locations [see also
McGovern et al., 2004]. McKenzie et al. [2002] made local admittance analyses of line-of-sight
2
gravity data both with flat plates and with spherical shell models. Turcotte et al. [2002] used
the spherical shell formula for a one-dimensional wavelet analysis of the admittance in order
to determine the average elastic thickness of the lithosphere. Zhong and Roberts [2003] and
Lowry and Zhong [2003] studied the support of the Tharsis rise with an hybrid model including
the flexure of a thin elastic shell as well as the internal loading of a thermal plume in the mantle.
Belleguic et al. [2005] determined the elastic thickness and the density beneath large volcanoes.
Searls et al. [2006] investigated the elastic thickness and the density beneath the Utopia and
Hellas basins.
Though Venus is considered as a one-plate planet, there are no giant volcanic or tec-
tonic structures comparable to Tharsis. The spherical shell model has thus not been used
as often for Venus as for Mars: Banerdt [1986] studied the global stress distribution and
Anderson and Smrekar [2006] established a global map of the elastic thickness based on lo-
cal admittance analysis. Mercury’s topography and gravity fields are not yet known well enough
to warrant the application of a thin elastic shell model. We refer to Wieczorek [2007] for a
review of the recent results regarding the lithosphere of the terrestrial planets.
The elastic thickness of the lithosphere is not at all homogeneous over the surface of a planet.
For example, McGovern et al. [2004] (for Mars) and Anderson and Smrekar [2006] (for Venus)
find lithospheric thickness variations between 0 and more than 100 km. However, thin spherical
shell models have always been applied with a constant elastic thickness for the whole lithosphere.
Local studies are done by windowing both the data (gravity and topography) and the model
predictions for gravity [Simons et al., 1997; Wieczorek and Simons , 2005]. The assumptions
behind these methods are that the elastic thickness is constant within the window and that the
area outside the window can be neglected. The first assumption is of course true for a small
enough window, but the size of the window is limited from below by the resolution of the data
[Wieczorek and Simons , 2005]. Even if the first assumption were true, the second assumption is
violated in two ways (unless the elastic thickness is spatially constant). First, the deformation of
the shell within the window as well as the associated stress field are both modified if the elastic
thickness is changed in the area outside the window. Second, the value of the predicted gravity
field within the window depends on the shell deflection outside the window.
These reasons make it interesting to develop a model of the lithospheric flexure for a spher-
ical shell of variable thickness. Although a full inversion of the gravity and topography data is
impractical with such a model because of the huge size of the parameter space, other applications
are of high interest. For example a two-stage inversion can be considered: in the first stage a
constant elastic thickness is assumed, and the resulting values are used in the second stage as a
starting point for an inversion with variable elastic thickness (the parameter space can also be
constrained with an a priori). Moreover this model can be used to produce synthetic data and
thus allows us to check the validity of inversions assuming a constant elastic thickness. Finally,
stress and strain fields can be computed for given variations of the elastic thickness, with the
aim of comparing stress and strain maps with tectonic features.
General equations governing the deformations of a thin elastic shell have been given by
3
various authors [e.g. Love, 1944; Vlasov , 1964; Kraus , 1967]. However the possibility of variable
shell thickness is only considered at the early stage where the strain-displacement relationships,
Hooke’s law and the equilibrium equations are separately derived for the thin shell. The com-
bination of these three sets of equations into a unique equation for the transverse deflection is
made under the restriction of constant elastic thickness, ‘owing to the analytical complications
which would otherwise arise’ [see Kraus , 1967, p. 199].
This article is dedicated to the derivation of the minimum set of equations governing the
deformations of a thin elastic spherical shell with variable thickness. Using Kraus’ method of
stress functions, we find that the transverse deflection is the solution of a simultaneous system of
two differential equations of the fourth order. Contrary to the case of constant thickness, these
equations cannot be combined due to the presence of products of derivatives of the thickness
and derivatives of the deflection or of the stress function. In order to include bottom loading
generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress functions to include toroidal
tangential loads, which were not considered by Kraus [1967]. Non-toroidal loading is for example
generated by tangential lithostatic forces whereas toroidal loading could be due to mantle flow
generating drag at the base of the lithosphere (mantle flow also produces non-toroidal loading).
For applications in tectonics, we derive the equations relating the tangential displacements and
the stresses to the transverse deflection and the stress functions. We further show that toroidal
tangential displacement occurs even if there is no toroidal loading (unless the shell thickness is
constant). Finally we prove that the degree-one harmonic component of the deflection drops
from the elasticity equations and is completely determined by the equilibrium equations for the
external forces. Though our aim is to introduce a variable shell thickness, the final equations
are also valid for a variable Young’s modulus (Poisson’s ratio must be kept constant).
We choose to work within the formalism of differential calculus on curved surfaces, without
which the final equations would be cumbersome. Actually the only tool used in this formalism
is the covariant derivative, which can be considered by geophysicists as just a way of combining
several terms into one ‘derivative’. All necessary formulas are given in the Appendix. The
possibility of writing a differential equation in terms of covariant derivatives (in a tensorial
form) also provides a consistency check. The presence of derivatives that cannot be included
into covariant derivatives is simply forbidden. This is not without meaning for differential
equations of the fourth order including products of derivatives.
In section 2, we show how to obtain the strain-displacement relationships, Hooke’s law
and the equilibrium equations for a thin spherical shell. These equations are available in the
literature for the general case of a thin shell [e.g. Kraus , 1967], but we derive them for the
spherical case in a simpler way, starting directly with the metric for the spherical shell. We
examine in detail the various approximations made to obtain the thin shell theory of flexure,
refraining until the end from taking the ‘thin shell’ quantitative limit in order to ascertain its
influence on the final equations. In section 3, we use the method of stress functions to obtain
the flexure equations governing the displacements and the stresses. In section 4, we give the
final form of the flexure equations in the thin shell approximation. We also study the covariance
4
and the degree-one projection of the flexure equations. In section 5, we examine various limit
cases in which the flexure equations take a simpler form: the membrane limit, the Euclidean
limit and the limit of constant thickness.
2 Fundamental equations of elasticity
2.1 Three-dimensional elasticity theory
Linear elasticity theory is based on three sets of equations. We directly state them in tensorial
form for an isotropic material, since they are derived in Cartesian coordinates in many books
[e.g. Ranalli , 1987; Synge and Schild , 1978]. Recall that, in tensorial notation, there is an
implicit summation on indices that are repeated on the same side of an equation. The first set
of equations includes strain-displacement relationships:
ǫij =
1
2
(ui,j + uj,i) , (1)
where ǫij is the infinitesimal strain tensor and ui are the finite displacements. The ‘comma’
notation denotes the spatial derivative (see Appendix 7.2).
The second set includes the constitutive equations of elasticity, or Hooke’s law, relating the
strain tensor and the stress tensor σij :
σij = λ ǫ δij + 2Gǫij , (2)
where ǫ = ǫ11 + ǫ22 + ǫ33 and δij = 1 if i = j, otherwise it equals zero. The parameter λ is
known as the first Lame´ constant. The parameter G is known as the second Lame´ constant, or
the shear modulus, or the modulus of rigidity. Boundary conditions are given by
σij nj = Ti , (3)
with nj being the normal unit vector of the surface element and Ti being the surface force per
unit area.
The third set includes equations of motion which reduce to equilibrium equations for stresses
if the problem is static:
σij,j = 0 . (4)
Body forces, such as gravity, are assumed to be absent. Both strain and stress tensors are
symmetric: ǫij = ǫji and σij = σji.
These three-dimensional equations do not yet have the right form for the description of the
deformations of a two-dimensional spherical shell. Various methods have been used to gener-
ate appropriate equations. Love [1944] and Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger [1964] derive
strain-displacements and equilibrium equations directly on the surface of the sphere (the latter
only for the special cases of no bending or axisymmetrical loading). Sokolnikoff [1956] derives
strain-displacement equations in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates using an arbitrary
diagonal metric but states without proof the equilibrium equations in curvilinear coordinates.
5
Kraus [1967] uses Sokolnikoff’s form of strain-displacement equations and derives equilibrium
equations for an arbitrary two-dimensional surface using Hamilton’s principle (i.e. virtual dis-
placements).
Instead of directly deriving equations on the two-dimensional surface of the sphere, we
will first obtain their form in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates and then restrict them
to the surface of the sphere. The first step can elegantly be done through the use of tensors
[Synge and Schild , 1978]. Equations (1)-(4) are tensorial with respect to orthogonal transfor-
mations, but not with respect to other coordinate transforms (one reason being the presence
of usual derivatives). In other words, they are only valid in Cartesian coordinates. In a three-
dimensional Euclidean space, tensorial equations have a simplified form in Cartesian coordinates
because supplementary terms that make them tensorial with respect to arbitrary coordinate
transformations are zero. The missing terms can be reconstructed by using a set of rules, such
as the replacement of usual derivatives by covariant derivatives and the substitution of tensorial
contraction to sum on components. Correspondence rules lead to the following three sets of
equations:
ǫij =
1
2
(
ui|j + uj|i
)
, (5)
σij = λ ǫ gij + 2Gǫij , (6)
gjk σij|k = 0 , (7)
where ǫ = gkl ǫkl. The notation ui|j denotes the covariant derivative of ui (see Appendix 7.2).
The metric and its inverse are noted gij and g
ij , respectively. Tensorial components cannot
be expressed in a normalized basis (except for Cartesian coordinates) which is more common
for physical interpretation (see Appendix 7.1). Covariant components in equations (5)-(7) are
related to components defined in a normalized basis (written with a hat) by:
ui =
√
gii uˆi ,
ǫij =
√
giigjj ǫˆij ,
σij =
√
giigjj σˆij ,
where there is no implicit summation on repeated indices.
In the next section we will introduce additional assumptions in order to restrict the equations
to the two-dimensional surface of a spherical shell.
2.2 Spherical shell
2.2.1 Assumptions of the thin shell theory
Suppose that the two first coordinates are the colatitude θ and longitude ϕ on the surface of
the sphere, whereas the third coordinate ζ is radial. R is the shell radius.
Assumptions of the thin shell theory are [see Kraus , 1967, chap. 2.2]:
1. The shell is thin (say less than one tenth of the radius of the sphere).
6
2. The deflections of the shell are small.
3. The transverse normal stress is negligible: σζζ = 0.
4. Normals to the reference surface of the shell remain normal to it and undergo no change
of length during deformation: ǫθζ = ǫϕζ = ǫζζ = 0.
The second assumption allows us to use linear equations to describe the deflections. The third
and fourth assumptions are not fully consistent: we refer to Kraus [1967] for more details. We
will relax them in the derivation of the equations for the deflection of a spherical shell. The
crucial assumption is σζζ = 0 which is essential for the restriction of Hooke’s law to the two-
dimensional shell. As we will see later, σζζ cannot be zero since it is related to the non-zero
transverse load (besides the fact that it is incompatible with a vanishing transverse strain).
What is absolutely necessary is that σζζ ≪ σii for i = (θ, ϕ). The validity of this condition will
be checked on the constant thickness solution in section 5.3.
The reference surface is the middle surface of the shell. With the aim of integrating out the
third coordinate, a coordinate system is chosen so that the radial coordinate ζ is zero on the
reference surface. The metric is given by
ds2 = (R+ ζ)2
(
dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2
)
+ dζ2 . (8)
Christoffel symbols necessary for the computation of the covariant derivatives are given in Ap-
pendix 7.3.
2.2.2 Strain-displacement equations
With the metric (8), the strain-displacement equations (5) become
ǫˆθθ =
1
R+ ζ
(uˆθ,θ + uˆζ) ,
ǫˆϕϕ =
1
R+ ζ
(csc θ uˆϕ,ϕ + cot θ uˆθ + uˆζ) ,
ǫˆθϕ =
1
2
1
R+ ζ
(csc θ uˆθ,ϕ − cot θ uˆϕ + uˆϕ,θ) , (9)
ǫˆζζ = uˆζ,ζ ,
ǫˆθζ =
1
2
1
R+ ζ
((R+ ζ) uˆθ,ζ − uˆθ + uˆζ,θ) ,
ǫˆϕζ =
1
2
1
R+ ζ
((R+ ζ) uˆϕ,ζ − uˆϕ + csc θ uˆζ,ϕ) ,
where all quantities are given in a normalized basis. The fourth assumption of the thin shell
theory implies that the displacements are linearly distributed across the thickness of the shell,
with the transverse displacement being constant. Displacements can thus be expanded to first
order in ζ:
(uˆθ, uˆϕ, uˆζ) = (vθ + ζβθ, vϕ + ζβϕ, w) . (10)
7
The coefficients (vθ, vϕ, w, βθ , βϕ) are independent of ζ: (vθ, vϕ, w) represent the components
of the displacement vector of a point on the reference surface, whereas (βθ, βϕ) represent the
rotations of tangents to the reference surface oriented along the tangent axes. We determine βθ
and βϕ by applying the fourth assumption of thin shell theory and the expansion (10) to the
last two strain-displacement equations (9):
βθ =
1
R
(vθ − w,θ) ,
βϕ =
1
R
(vϕ − csc θ w,ϕ) . (11)
The substitution of the expansion (10) into the fourth strain-displacement equation (ǫˆζζ = uˆζ,ζ)
leads to the condition ǫˆζζ = 0, as postulated by thin shell theory.
We are now going to write the first three strain-displacement equations (9) in a form linear
in ζ. Under the first assumption of thin shell theory, one usually makes the approximation
1
R+ζ
∼= 1R in the equations [see Kraus , 1967, chap. 2.4]. The resulting equations are not correct
at first order in ζ/R, which induces the presence of supplementary terms of order h2/R2 in the
bending moments as well as in the final equations of the theory. However, this approximation
does not simplify the calculations when the shell is a sphere because it has only one radius of
curvature (for a shell with two radii of curvature, this approximation is a great simplification).
We thus expand the prefactor to first order in ζ:
1
R+ ζ
∼= 1
R
(
1− ζ
R
)
. (12)
After the insertion of expansions (10) and (12), the first three strain-displacement equations (9)
become, to first order in ζ,
ǫˆθθ = ǫ
0
θ + ζ κθ ,
ǫˆϕϕ = ǫ
0
ϕ + ζ κϕ , (13)
2 ǫˆθϕ = γ
0
θϕ + ζ τ .
The extensional strains ǫ0θ, ǫ
0
ϕ and γ
0
θϕ are defined by
ǫ0θ =
1
R
(vθ,θ + w) ,
ǫ0ϕ =
1
R
(csc θ vϕ,ϕ + cot θ vθ + w) , (14)
γ0θϕ =
1
R
(vϕ,θ − cot θ vϕ + csc θ vθ,ϕ) .
They represent the normal and shearing strains of the reference surface. The flexural strains κθ,
κϕ and τ are given by
κθ = − 1
R2
O1 w ,
κϕ = − 1
R2
O2 w , (15)
τ = − 2
R2
O3 w .
8
They represent the changes in curvature and the torsion of the reference surface during defor-
mation [Kraus , 1967]. The differential operators O1,2,3 are defined by
O1 = ∂
2
∂θ2
+ 1 ,
O2 = csc2 θ ∂
2
∂ϕ2
+ cot θ
∂
∂θ
+ 1 , (16)
O3 = csc θ
(
∂2
∂θ∂ϕ
− cot θ ∂
∂ϕ
)
.
Since Kraus does not make the expansion (12), he obtains supplementary terms in the expressions
for κθ, κϕ and τ which depend on ǫ
0
θ, ǫ
0
ϕ and γ
0
θϕ. Our expressions for κθ, κϕ and τ only depend
on the transverse displacement w.
2.2.3 Hooke’s law
When the metric is diagonal and the basis is normalized, Hooke’s law (6) becomes
σˆii = λ
3∑
k=1
ǫˆkk + 2G ǫˆii (i = j) ,
σˆij = 2G ǫˆij (i 6= j) .
There is no implicit summation on repeated indices.
The third assumption of the thin shell theory, σˆζζ = 0, can be used to eliminate ǫˆζζ from
Hooke’s law:
σˆθθ =
E
1− ν2 (ǫˆθθ + ν ǫˆϕϕ) ,
σˆϕϕ =
E
1− ν2 (ǫˆϕϕ + ν ǫˆθθ) .
Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio ν are related to Lame´ parameters by
λ =
Eν
(1 + ν)(1− 2ν) ,
G =
E
2(1 + ν)
.
In principle, the fourth assumption of the thin shell theory, ǫˆθζ = ǫˆϕζ = 0, leads to σˆθζ = σˆϕζ = 0
but non-vanishing values must be retained for purposes of equilibrium.
The substitution of the linear expansion (13) into the thin shell approximation of Hooke’s
law gives
σˆθθ =
E
1− ν2
(
ǫ0θ + νǫ

We now integrate the stress distributions across the thickness h of the shell (see Figure 1).
The stress resultants and couples obtained in this way are defined per unit of arc length on the
reference surface:

We evaluate these integrals with the linear expansion (17). The tangential stress resultants are

where the equations have been multiplied by sin θ (R+ζ), (R+ζ) and sin θ (R+ζ)2, respectively.
The stress components are given in a normalized basis.
The integration on ζ of these three equations in the range [−h/2, h/2] yields the equilibrium
equations for the forces:
(sin θ Nθ),θ +Nθϕ,ϕ − cos θNϕ + sin θ Qθ +R sin θ qθ = 0 , (27)
(sin θNθϕ),θ +Nϕ,ϕ + cos θNθϕ + sin θ Qϕ +R sin θ qϕ = 0 , (28)
(sin θ Qθ),θ +Qϕ,ϕ − sin θ (Nθ +Nϕ)−R sin θ q = 0 , (29)
where qθ and qϕ are the components of the tangential load vector per unit area of the reference
surface: [
(R+ ζ)2 σˆζi
]h/2
−h/2
= R2 qi (i = θ, ϕ) .
We choose the convention that tensile stresses are positive (see Figure 1). The transverse load
per unit area of the reference surface is noted q and is taken to be positive toward the center of
the sphere: [
(R+ ζ)2 σˆζζ
]h/2
−h/2
= −R2 q . (30)
The first two equilibrium equations for the stresses can also be multiplied by ζ before the
integration to yield the equilibrium equations for the moments:
(sin θMθ),θ +Mθϕ,ϕ − cos θMϕ −R sin θ Qθ = 0 , (31)
(sin θMθϕ),θ +Mϕ,ϕ + cos θMθϕ −R sin θ Qϕ = 0 . (32)
We have neglected small terms in
[

where i = (θ, ϕ). A third equilibrium
equation for the moments exists but has the form of an identity: Mθϕ =Mϕθ.
3 Resolution
3.1 Available methods
At this stage the elastic theory for a thin spherical shell involves 17 equations: six strain-
displacement relationships (14)-15), six relations (19)-(20) making Hooke’s law, and five equilib-
rium equations (27)-(32). There are 17 unknowns: six strain components (ǫ0θ, ǫ
0
ϕ, γ
0
θϕ, κθ, κϕ, τ),
three displacements (w, vθ , vϕ), three tangential stress resultants (Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ), two transverse
shearing stress resultants (Qθ, Qϕ), and three moment resultants (Mθ,Mϕ,Mθϕ). The three
equations (17) are also needed if the tangential stresses (σˆθθ, σˆθϕ, σˆϕϕ) are required. The quan-
tities of primary interest are the transverse deflection and the tangential stresses (sometimes
tangential strain is preferred, as in Banerdt and Golombek [2000]). We thus want to find the
minimum set of equations that must be solved to determine these quantities.
We are aware of two methods of resolution. In the first one, we insert the strain-displacement
relationships into Hooke’s law, and substitute in turn Hooke’s law into the equilibrium equations.
12
This method yields three simultaneous differential equations for the displacements. Once the
displacements are known, it is possible to compute the strains and the stresses. The second
method involves the introduction of so-called stress functions [Timoshenko and Goodier , 1951,
p. 26], without direct physical interpretation, which serve to define the stress resultants without
introducing the tangential displacements. Equations relating the transverse displacement and
the stress functions are then found by applying the third equation of equilibrium and the equation
of compatibility [Timoshenko and Goodier , 1951, p. 23]. The latter equation relates the partial
derivatives of the strain components. Once the transverse displacement and the stress functions
are known, it is possible to compute the stresses.
If the shell thickness is constant, the deformations of a thin spherical shell can be completely
calculated with both methods. If the shell thickness is variable, the three equations governing
displacements, obtained with the first method, cannot be decoupled and are not easy to solve.
The method with stress functions leads to a system of three equations (relating the transverse
displacement and the two stress functions), in which the first equation is decoupled and solved
before the other two. This method thus provides a system of equations much easier to solve and
will be chosen in this article.
One usually neglects terms in ζ/R when computing the resultants (18), with the result that
all terms in 1/R vanish in the right-hand sides of expressions (19)-(20). In this approximation,
the tangential stress resultants only depend on the extensional strains (ǫ0θ, ǫ
0
ϕ, γ
0
θϕ) whereas the
moment resultants only depend on flexural strains (κθ, κϕ, τ). However the extensional strains
are not necessarily small with respect to the flexural strains in the moment resultants (20).
Moreover, it is inconsistent in our method of resolution to neglect the flexural strains in the
stress resultants (19), since the stress resultants will be determined from the moment resultants
through their sum (see section 3.3.1). Instead of discussing the various cases [see Love , 1944,
p. 531], we decide to keep the terms in 1/R in the formulas (19)-(20). We will only take the
limit of thin shell limit (or large ξ limit, i.e. h2 ≪ R2) at the end of the resolution. This
procedure will not complicate the computations, since we have to compute anyway many new
terms because of the variable shell thickness,
3.2 Differential operators
We will repeatedly encounter the operators Oi which intervene in the expressions (15) for the
flexural strains (κθ, κϕ, τ). Since we are looking for scalar equations, we need to find out how
the operators Oi can be combined in order to yield scalar expressions, i.e. expressions that are
invariant with respect to changes of coordinates on the sphere.
The first thing is to relate the Oi to tensorial operators. Starting from the covariant
derivatives on the sphere ∇i, we construct the following tensorial differential operators of the
second degree in derivatives:
Dij = ∇i∇j + gij , (33)
where ∇i denotes the covariant derivative (see Appendix 7.2). These operators give zero when
13
applied on spherical harmonics of degree-one (considered as scalars):
Dij Y1m = 0 (m = −1, 0, 1) . (34)
This property can be explicitly checked on the spherical harmonics Y1,0 = cos θ, Y1,±1 = sin θe
±iϕ
with the metric (103) and the formulas for the double covariant derivatives given in Appendix
7.4.
In two-dimensional spherical coordinates (θ, ϕ), the three operators Oi defined by equations
(16) are related to the operators Dij acting on a scalar function f through
O1 f = Dθθ f ,
O2 f = csc2 θDϕϕ f , (35)
O3 f = csc θDθϕ f .
The operators O1,2,3f actually correspond to normalized Dijf , i.e. Dijf/(√giigjj).
The usual derivatives of the operators Oi satisfy the useful identities (111)-(112) which are
proven in Appendix 7.6. These identities are the consequence of the path dependence of the
parallel transport of vectors on the curved surface of the sphere.
Invariant expressions are built by contracting all indices of the differential operators in
their tensorial form. The indices can be contracted with the inverse metric gij or with the
antisymmetric tensor εij (see Appendix 7.4), which should not be confused with the strain
tensor ǫij . In the following, a and b are scalar functions on the sphere.
At degree 2, the only non-zero contraction of the Dij is related to the Laplacian (107):
∆′ a ≡ gij Dij a
= (O1 +O2) a (36)
= (∆ + 2) a .
At degree 4, a scalar expression symmetric in (a, b) is given by
A(a ; b) ≡ [∆′ a][∆′ b]− [Dij a][Dij b] ,
= [O1 a][O2 b] + [O2 a][O1 b]− 2 [O3 a][O3 b] (37)
= [∆ a][∆ b]− [∇i∇j a][∇i∇j b] + [∆ a] b+ a [∆ b] + 2 a b .
where upper indices are raised with the inverse metric: Dij = gikgjlDkl. The action of an
operator does not extend beyond the brackets enclosing it.
If a is constant, A(a ; b) = a∆′b. It is useful to define an associated operator A0 that gives
zero if its first argument is constant:
A0(a ; b) = A(a ; b)− a
[
∆′b
]
. (38)
A scalar expression of degree 4 antisymmetric in (a, b) is given by
B1(a ; b) ≡ gij εkl [Dik a] [Djl b]
= [(O1 −O2) a] [O3b]− [O3a] [(O1 −O2) b] (39)
= gij εkl [∇i∇k a] [∇j∇l b] .
14
We will also need another operator of degree 4:
B2(a ; b) ≡ εij [∇ia ]
[∇j ∆′ b]
= csc θ
(
a,θ
[
∆′b
]
,ϕ
− a,ϕ
[
∆′b
]
,θ
)
. (40)
The sum of the operators B1 and B2 is noted B:
B(a ; b) = B1(a ; b) + B2(a ; b) . (41)
The operators A and B have an interesting property proven in Appendix 7.7: for arbitrary
scalar functions a and b, A(a ; b) and B(a ; b) do not have a degree-one term in their spherical
harmonic expansion. This is not true of A0, B1 and B2.
3.3 Transverse displacement
3.3.1 Resolution of the equations of equilibrium
The first step consists in finding expressions for the moment resultants (Mθ,Mϕ,Mθϕ) in terms
of the transverse displacement and the stress resultants. The extensional strains (ǫ0θ, ǫ
0
ϕ, γ
0
θϕ) can
be eliminated between the equations for stress and moment resultants (19)-(20). The flexural
strains (κθ, κϕ, τ) depend on the transverse displacement w through equations (15). We thus
obtain
Mθ = −D
′
R2
(O1 + νO2)w + R

Nθ ,
Mϕ = −D

(O2 + νO1)w + R

Nϕ , (42)
Mθϕ = −D

R2
(1− ν)O3 w + R
ξ
Nθϕ .
The large parameter ξ is defined by equation (23) and D′ is defined by
D′ =
(
1− 1
ξ
)
D . (43)
The terms in (Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ) in the right-hand sides of equations (42) appear because we have
not made the approximation h≪ R in equations (20). Note that similar terms appear in Kraus’
formulas but for a different reason: Kraus does not make the expansion (12).
The second step consists in solving the equilibrium equations for moments in order to find
the transverse shearing stress resultants (Qθ, Qϕ). We substitute expressions (42) into equations
(31)-(32). Knowing that the stress resultants satisfy the equilibrium equations (27)-(28), we
obtain new expressions for Qθ and Qϕ (identities (111)-(112) are helpful):
Qθ = − η

15
The operator ∆′ is defined by equation (36) and
η =
ξ
1 + ξ
(46)
The third step consists in finding expressions for the stress resultants (Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ) in
terms of stress functions by solving the first two equilibrium equations (27)-(28). We observe
that the linear combinations (P+θ , P
+
ϕ , P
+
θϕ) defined by equation (26) satisfy simplified equations
of equilibrium:
(
sin θ P+θ
)
,θ
+ P+θϕ,ϕ − cos θ P+ϕ +R sin θ qθ = 0 ,(
sin θ P+θϕ
)
,θ
+ P+ϕ,ϕ + cos θ P
+
θϕ +R sin θ qϕ = 0 . (47)
Comparing these equilibrium equations with the identities (111)-(112), we see that the
homogeneous equations (i.e. equations (47) with a zero tangential load qθ = qϕ = 0) are always
satisfied if (
P+θ , P
+
ϕ , P
+
θϕ
)
= (O2,O1,−O3)F , (48)
where F is an auxiliary function called stress function. For the moment, this function is com-
pletely arbitrary apart from being scalar and differentiable.
Particular solutions of the full equations (47) can be found if we express the tangential load
qT = qθθˆ + qϕϕˆ in terms of the surface gradient of a scalar potential Ω (consoidal or poloidal
component) and the surface curl of a vector potential V rˆ (toroidal component):
qT = − 1
R
∇¯Ω+ 1
R
∇¯ × (V rˆ) . (49)
Surface operators are defined in Appendix 7.5, where the terms consoidal/poloidal are also
discussed. The covariant components of qT are (qθ, sin θqϕ) and can be expressed as − 1RΩ,i +

qθ = − 1
R
Ω,θ +

sin θ qϕ = − 1

If the tangential load is consoidal (V = 0), a particular solution of equations (47) is given by
(
P+θ , P
+
ϕ , P
+
θϕ
)
= (1, 1, 0)Ω . (51)
If the tangential load is toroidal (Ω = 0), a particular solution of equations (47) is given by
(
P+θ , P
+
ϕ , P
+
θϕ
)
= (2O3,−2O3,O2 −O1)H , (52)
where we have introduced a second stress function H which satisfies the constraint
∆′H = −V + V0 , (53)
16
where V0 is a constant (identities (111)-(112) are useful). This equation allows us to determine
the stress function H if the toroidal source V is known.
The general solution of the equations (47) is given by the sum of the general solution (48)
of the homogeneous equations and the two particular solutions (51)-(52) of the full equations:(
P+θ , P
+
ϕ , P
+
θϕ
)
= (O2F +Ω+ 2O3H,O1F +Ω− 2O3H,−O3F + (O2 −O1)H) . (54)
The stress resultants (Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ) can now be obtained from (P
+
θ , P
+
ϕ , P
+
θϕ) by using equations
(26) and (42):
(Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ) = η
(
P+θ , P

which finally give

Nθϕ = η

R3
O3 w + (O2 −O1)H
)
.
The fourth step consists in expressing the third equation of equilibrium (29) in terms of
the transverse displacement w and the stress functions F and H. For this purpose, it is handy
to express the transverse shearing stress resultants (Qθ, Qϕ) in terms of (w,F,H). We thus
substitute Nϕ, Nθ, Nθϕ, given by equations (56), into the expressions for Qθ and Qϕ, given by
equations (44)-(45):

. (58)
The various terms present in Qθ and Qϕ can be classified into generic types according to
their differential structure. Each generic type will contribute in a characteristic way to the
third equation of equilibrium. It is worthwhile to compute the generic contribution of each type
before using the full expressions of the stress resultants with their multiple terms. Identities
(111)-(112) are helpful in this calculation. We thus write the third equation of equilibrium (29)
as follows:
I (Qθ ;Qϕ ; 0)− (Nθ +Nϕ)−Rq = 0 , (59)
where the differential operator I is defined for arbitrary expressions (X,Y,Z) by
I(X ;Y ;Z) = csc θ (sin θX),θ + csc θ Y,ϕ − cot θ Z . (60)
17
This operator must be evaluated for the following generic types present in (Qθ, Qϕ):
I (a,θ ; csc θ a,ϕ ; 0) = ∆a ,
I (− csc θ a,ϕ ; a,θ ; 0) = 0 ,
I (a,θO2b− csc θ a,ϕO3b ;−a,θO3b+ csc θ a,ϕO1b ; 0) = A0(a ; b) , (61)
I (a,θO3b+ csc θ a,ϕO2b ;−a,θO1b− csc θ a,ϕO3b ; 0) = B1(a ; b) ,
I (− csc θ (a,ϕ∆′b− a[∆′b],ϕ) ; a,θ∆′b− a[∆′b],θ ; 0) = 2B2(a ; b) ,
where a and b are scalar functions. The operators A0, B1 and B2 are defined in section 3.2.
We now substitute (Qθ, Qϕ) and (Nϕ, Nθ) into the third equation of equilibrium (59) and
use formulas (61). We thus obtain the first of the differential equations that relate w and the
stress functions F and H:
∆′
(
ηD′∆′w
)− (1− ν)A(ηD′ ;w) +R3A(η ;F ) + 2R3 B(η ;H)
= −R4 q +R3 (∆Ω−∆′(ηΩ)) , (62)
The operators ∆′, A and B are defined in section 3.2.
3.3.2 Compatibility relation
A second equation relating the transverse displacement and the stress functions comes from
the compatibility relation which is derived by eliminating (vθ, vϕ) from the strain-displacement
equations (14):
(
sin θ γ0θϕ,ϕ
)
,θ

)

The strain components are related to the stress resultants through the inverse Hooke’s law (24).
The substitution of equations (24) into the compatibility equation (63) gives

For arbitrary expressions (X,Y,Z), J (X ;Y ;Z) is defined by
J (X ;Y ;Z) = csc2 θ
((
sin2 θX,θ
)
,θ
+ Y,ϕ,ϕ + 2 (sin θ Z,ϕ),θ
)
− cot θ Y,θ + 2Y . (65)
The quantities (P−θ , P

ϕ , P

θϕ) defined by equations (26) can be written in terms of the
transverse displacement and the stress functions:
P−θ = η

)
.
18
η′ is defined by
η′ =
(
1− 1
ξ
)
η . (67)
As in the case of the third equation of equilibrium, it is practical to classify the terms present
in (P−θ , P
−
ϕ , P
−
θϕ) into generic types and evaluate separately their contribution to the equation
of compatibility. There are three types of terms for which we must evaluate the operator J
(identities (111)-(114) are helpful in this calculation):
J (a ; a ; 0) = ∆′a ,
J (aO2b ; aO1b ;−aO3b) = A(a, b) , (68)
J (2aO3b ;−2aO3b ; a(O2 −O1)b) = 2B(a, b) ,
where a and b are scalar functions. The operators ∆′, A and B are defined in section 3.2.
We now evaluate J in equation (64) with expressions (66) and formulas (68):
J
(
α′ P−θ ;α
′ P−ϕ ;α
′ P−θϕ
)
= A(ηα ;F ) + 2
R3
∆′
(
ηαD∆′w
)− 2
R3
(1− ν)A(ηαD ;w)
+ ∆′ (ηαΩ) + 2B(ηα ;H) . (69)
The term A(ηαD ;w) can be rewritten with the help of the following equality:
1− ν2
R2
A(ηαD ;w) = ∆′w −A(η ;w) , (70)
since (1− ν2)ηαD/R2 = η/ξ and (η/ξ),i = −η,i.
We finally substitute P−θ + P
−
ϕ , given by equations (66), into the compatibility equation
(64) and use expressions (69)-(70). We thus obtain the second of the differential equations that
relate w and the stress functions F and H:
∆′ (ηα∆′F )− (1 + ν)A(ηα ;F ) + 1
R
∆′w − 2
R
A(η ;w)− 2(1 + ν)B(ηα ;H)
= −(1− ν)∆′(ηαΩ) , (71)
3.4 Tangential displacements
Assuming that the flexure equations (62) and (71) for the transverse displacement w and the
stress functions (F,H) have been solved, we now show how to calculate the tangential displace-
ments.
In analogy with the decomposition of the tangential load in equations (49)-(50), the tan-
gential displacement can be separated into consoidal and toroidal components:
v = ∇¯S + ∇¯ × (T rˆ) , (72)
where S and T are the consoidal and toroidal scalars, respectively. The covariant components
of v are (vθ, sin θ vϕ) and can be expressed as S,i + g
jkεikT,j (see Appendix 7.5), which gives
vθ = S,θ + csc θ T,ϕ ,
sin θ vϕ = S,ϕ − sin θ T,θ . (73)
19
The strain-displacement equations (14) become
ǫ0θ =
1
R
((O1 − 1)S +O3T + w) ,
ǫ0ϕ =
1
R
((O2 − 1)S −O3T + w) , (74)
γ0θϕ =
1
R
(2O3S + (O2 −O1)T ) .
The stress resultants (Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ) given by equations (19) become
Nθ =
K
R
(
∆S +
(
1 + ν − ξ−1∆′)w − (1− ν) ((O2 − 1)S −O3 T − ξ−1O2w)) ,
Nϕ =
K
R
(
∆S +
(
1 + ν − ξ−1∆′)w − (1− ν) ((O1 − 1)S +O3 T − ξ−1O1w)) , (75)
Nθϕ =
K
R
1− ν
2
(
2O3 S − 2 ξ−1O3w + (O2 −O1)T
)
.
The toroidal potential T cancels in the sum Nθ +Nϕ:
Nθ +Nϕ =
K
R
(1 + ν)
(
∆S +
(
2− ξ−1∆′)w) .
The consoidal displacement potential S can thus be related to (w,F,Ω) by using expressions
(56) for the stress resultants:
∆S = Rηα (1− ν) (∆′F + 2Ω)+ 2η
ξ
∆′w − 2w , (76)
where α is defined by equation (25).
It is more difficult to extract the toroidal displacement potential T . When the shell thickness
is constant, decoupled equations for the displacements can be found by suitable differentiation
and combination of the three equilibrium equations (27)-(29) for the stress resultants. This
method does not work if the shell thickness is variable because the resulting equations are
coupled. The trick consists in relating the tangential displacements to (w,F,H) by the way
of equations similar to the homogeneous part of the first two equilibrium equations, but with
(Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ) replaced by
R
K (Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ), so that derivatives of
1
K do not mix with derivatives
of T . We will thus calculate the following expression in two different ways (from equations (56)
and (75)):
Z

,
Y = sin θ I
(

.
The operator I is defined by equation (60).
20
As before, it is easier to begin with the evaluation of the operator Z for generic contributions:

The equality of the two previous formulas yields the sought equation for T :
∆∆′ T = 2R (1 + ν)
(B (ηα ;F )− 2A (ηα ;H) + ∆′ (ηα∆′H))+ 4B (η ;w) . (77)
We have used η′ + 1 = 2η and (η/ξ),i = −η,i.
The equation for T shows that toroidal displacement always occurs when the shell thickness
varies. The right-hand side of equation (77) only vanishes when two conditions are met: (1)
there is no toroidal source (so that the stress function H vanishes) and (2) the shell thickness is
constant (so that the terms in B vanish).
3.5 Stresses
Stresses can be computed from (w,F,H) and Ω by substituting equations (15), (24) and (66)
into equations (17):

Stresses at the surface are obtained by setting ζ = h/2.
Another possibility is to compute stresses from displacements (w,S, T ), by inserting equa-

4 Flexure equations and their properties
4.1 Thin shell approximation
The flexure equations derived in section 3 already include several assumptions of the thin shell
theory, but not yet the first one stating that the shell is thin. Of course, the three other
assumptions can be seen to be consequences of the first one [see Kraus , 1967, chap. 2.2], but we
have not imposed in a quantitative way the thinness condition on the equations. We thus impose
the limit of small h/R or, equivalently, the limit of large ξ (defined by equation (23)) on the
flexure equations for (H,F,w, S, T ). This procedure amounts to expand η ≈ 1− 1/ξ (neglecting
terms in 1/ξ wherever appropriate), to approximate D′ ≈ D and to neglect the derivatives of η
in equations (53), (62), (71), (76) and (77). We thus obtain the final flexure equations for the
displacements (w,S, T ) and for the stress functions (F,H):
∆′H = −V + V0 , (80)

∆′w − 2w , (83)
∆∆′ T = 2R (1 + ν)
(B (α ;F )− 2A (α ;H) + ∆′ (α∆′H)) . (84)
Recall that the operators A and B are defined by equations (37) and (41). The bending rigidity
D, defined by equation (22), characterizes the ‘bending regime’ in which the shell bends in a
similar way as a flat plate (see section 5.2). The parameter α, defined by equation (25), is the
reciprocal of the extensional rigidity K and characterizes the ‘membrane regime’ of the shell
(see section 5.1). The potential pairs (Ω, V ) and (S, T ) are related to the tangential load and
displacement by equations (49) and (72), respectively.
In the second equation above, the term R3∆Ω/ξ has been kept since it could be large if
Ω has a short wavelength. For the same reason, the term 2∆′w/ξ has been kept in the fourth
equation. In the third and fifth equations, the terms depending on H belong to the right-hand
sides since they can be considered as a source once H has been calculated from the first equation.
The same can be said of the terms depending on w and F in the fourth and fifth equations: they
are supposed to be known from the simultaneous resolution of the second and third equations.
For numerical computations, the flexure equations (80)-(84) obtained in the thin shell ap-
proximation (to which we can add the equations (78) or (79) for the stresses) are adequate. For
this purpose, it is not useful to keep small terms in 1/ξ since the theory rests on assumptions
only true for a thin shell. In the rest of the article, we will continue to work with the equations
(53), (62), (71), (76) and (77) for more generality.
22
4.2 Covariance
Because of their tensorial form, the flexure equations (80)-(84) are covariant; this is also true
of the more general equations (53), (62), (71), (76) and (77). This property means that their
form is valid in all systems of coordinates on the sphere, though the tensor components (the
covariant derivatives of scalar functions, the metric and the antisymmetric tensor) will have a
different expression in each system. The scalar functions will also have a different dependence
on the coordinates in each system. The covariance of the final equations was expected. We
indeed started with tensorial equations in section 2.1; their restriction to the sphere in principle
respected the tensoriality with respect to changes of coordinates on the sphere. However the
covariance of the two-dimensional theory was not made explicit until we obtained the final
equations. This property is thus a strong constraint on the form of the solution and a check
of its validity, though only necessary and not sufficient (other covariant terms may have been
ignored).
Another advantage of the covariant form is the facility to express the final equations in
different systems of coordinates with the aim of solving them. For example, the finite difference
method in spherical coordinates (θ, ϕ) suffers from a very irregular grid and from pole singular-
ities. These problems can be avoided with the ‘cubed sphere’ coordinate system [Ronchi et al.,
1996]. Operators including covariant derivatives (here the Laplacian and the operators A and
B) can expressed in any system of coordinates whose metric is known. Christoffel symbols and
tensorial differential operators can be computed with symbolic mathematical software.
4.3 Degree one
All differential operators acting on (w,F,H) (that is ∆′, A and B) in the flexure equations (62)
and (71) can be expressed in terms of the operators Dij = ∇i∇j + gij (see section 3.2). The Dij
have the interesting property that they give zero when acting on spherical harmonics of degree
one (see equation (34)). Therefore the degree-one terms in the spherical harmonic expansion of
w vanish from the flexure equations. The magnitude of the transverse deflection of degree one
is thus independent from the elastic properties of the spherical shell.
Nevertheless the transverse deflection w may appear in the right-hand side of equation (62)
if the sphere is filled with a fluid, because it contributes to the transverse load q by Archimede’s
principle: q = qout + ρw, where qout is the pressure on the outer surface of the shell and ρ is
the density of the fluid inside the shell. Does it mean that there is a constraint on the degree-
one deflection in that case? This question leads us to examine what happens when the flexure
equations are projected on the spherical harmonics of degree one.
Since the operator ∆′ annihilates the degree one in any spherical harmonic expansion,
terms of the form ∆′f vanish when they are projected on the spherical harmonics of degree one.
Moreover, the operators A and B also vanish in this projection since they do not contain a degree-
one term (see equations (115)-(116) of Appendix 7.7). Therefore the degree-one component of
the flexure equation (71) is identically zero, whereas the degree-one component of the flexure
23
equation (62) is ∫
S
dω
(
q + ∇¯ · qT
)
Yi = 0 (i = x, y, z) , (85)
where dω = sin θ dθ dϕ and the integral is taken over the whole spherical surface. We have used
the relation ∆Ω = −R ∇¯ · qT derived from equations (49) and (108). The projection is done on
the real spherical harmonics of degree one which form the components of the radial unit vector
in Cartesian coordinates:
(Yx, Yy, Yz) = (sin θ cosϕ, sin θ sinϕ, cos θ)
= (xˆ, yˆ, zˆ) · rˆ .
The first term in the integrand of equation (85) is thus the projection on the Cartesian axes
(xˆ, yˆ, zˆ) of the radial vector field q rˆ defined on the sphere:
(q Yx, q Yy, q Yz) = (q rˆ · xˆ, q rˆ · yˆ, q rˆ · zˆ) . (86)
The second term in equation (85) can be rewritten with the identity (106) and Gauss’
theorem (109): ∫
S
dω
(∇¯ · qT )Yi = −
∫
S
dω qT · ∇¯Yi (i = x, y, z) , (87)
where the Yi are considered as scalars. The gradient of the real spherical harmonics can be
computed with formulas (100) and (104):
∇¯Yx = xˆ− sin θ cosϕ rˆ ,
∇¯Yy = yˆ − sin θ sinϕ rˆ ,
∇¯Yz = zˆ− cos θ rˆ .
Since qT is orthogonal to rˆ, the integrand of equation (87) is the projection of qT on the
Cartesian axes (xˆ, yˆ, zˆ):
(
qT · ∇¯Yx,qT · ∇¯Yy,qT · ∇¯Yz
)
= (qT · xˆ,qT · yˆ,qT · zˆ) . (88)
Recalling that the transverse load q was defined positive towards the center of the sphere (see
equation (30)), we define a total load vector q = −q rˆ+ qT . With the results (86) and (88), we
can rewrite the degree-one projection (85) as
∫
S
dω (q · xˆ ,q · yˆ ,q · zˆ) = (0, 0, 0) , (89)
which means that the integral (over the whole spherical surface) of the projection on the co-
ordinate axes of the total load vector vanishes. This result is the consequence of the static
assumption in the equations of motion (7), since a non-zero sum of the external forces would
accelerate the sphere.
If there is no consoidal tangent load (∇¯ · qT = 0), the absence of any degree-one term
in the spherical harmonic expansion of the transverse load q has the physical interpretation of
24
degree-one isostasy. Isostasy means that a charge acting on the outer surface of a shell filled
with a fluid is supported by the Archimede’s force due to the local deflection of the shell into
the fluid [Turcotte and Schubert , 2002]. The sum of the charge load and the reaction of the fluid
gives a total load equal to zero. Therefore the static assumption imposes that the degree-one
transverse deflection is such that the charge can be supported by Archimede’s principle. In the
special case of a sphere filled with a fluid having the same density as the fluid outside the sphere,
the degree-one transverse deflection must be zero.
We do not agree with Willemann and Turcotte [1982] when they say that ‘the degree 1
term represents the displacement of the shell, it does not result in stress in the lithosphere’.
The degree-one term in the deflection represents not only a global displacement, but also a
deformation of the shell. Suppose that the only harmonic component in the deflection is of
degree one. It is then possible to translate the center of the coordinate system to the center-of-
figure, so that the degree-one component vanishes. However harmonic components of degrees
higher than one will be present in the new coordinate system. Therefore stresses do not vanish.
5 Limit cases
5.1 Membrane limit
A shell is in a membrane state of stress if bending moments (Mθ,Mϕ,Mθϕ) can be neglected, in
analogy with a membrane which cannot support bending moments. Equations (26) show that
this assumption leads to
(P+θ , P
+
ϕ , P
+
θϕ) = (P
−
θ , P
−
ϕ , P
−
θϕ) = (Nθ, Nϕ, Nθϕ) .
The explicit expressions for these quantities, equations (54), (56) and (66), imply that
D = 0 .
We must also take the limit of infinite ξ: D′ = D and η′ = η = 1. The result D = 0 was
expected, since D is the bending rigidity. With these approximations, the first flexure equation
(62) for (w,F,H) becomes
∆′F = −Rq − 2Ω . (90)
The second flexure equation (71) for (w,F,H) becomes
1
R
∆′w = ∆′ (α∆′F )− (1 + ν)A(α ;F )− 2(1 + ν)B(α ;H) + (1− ν)∆′(αΩ) . (91)
If q is independent of w, F and w can be successively determined with spherical harmonic
transforms from equations (90) and (91). If q has a linear dependence in w (such as when the
sphere is filled with a fluid), w can be eliminated between equations (90) and (91), so that F
and w can also be computed in succession (however the equation for F cannot be solved by a
spherical harmonic transform). H is supposed to be known since equation (53) is not modified
and can be solved with spherical harmonics.
25
The stresses are obtained from equations (78) with the additional approximation of neglect-
ing the term in ζ:
(σˆθθ, σˆϕϕ, σˆθϕ) =
1
h
(O2F +Ω+ 2O3H,O1F +Ω− 2O3H,−O3F + (O2 −O1)H) .
Bending moments play a small role if the load has a large wavelength. In practice, the
threshold at which bending moments become significant can be evaluated from the constant
thickness equation for w (see section 5.3). One must compare the magnitudes of the terms in D
and 1/α in the left-hand side of equation (97). Bending moments are negligible (i.e. the term
in D) if the spherical harmonic degree ℓ of the transverse displacement w is such that
ℓ . k
√
R
h
, (92)
where k = (12(1 − ν2))1/4 ≈ 1.8 if we take ν = 1/4. This threshold is about 10 for a planet
with a radius of 3400 km and a lithospheric thickness equal to 100 km. Flexure equations in the
membrane limit of a shell with constant thickness have been used by Sleep and Phillips [1985]
to study the lithospheric stress in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars.
5.2 Euclidean limit
The equation for the deflection of a rectangular plate with variable thickness has been derived
by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger [1964, p. 173]. We will check here that the Euclidean
limit of our equations gives the same answer.
Let us define the coordinates
x = Rϕ ,
y = Rθ′ ,
where θ′ = θ/2 − θ is the latitude. We work in a small latitude band around the equator (so
that θ′ ≪ 1) and in the limit of large spherical radius R. Under this change of coordinate, each
derivative introduces a factor R with the result that terms with the largest number of derivatives
dominate. In particular, covariant derivatives can be approximated by usual derivatives. The
surface Laplacian (107) can be approximated as follows:
∆ ≈ R2
(
∂2
∂x2
+
∂2
∂y2
)
,
≡ R2 ∆e .
We assume that there are no tangential loads (Ω = V = H = 0).
The flexure equations (81)-(82) for the transverse displacement become:
R4 ∆e (D∆ew)− (1− ν)R4Ae(D ;w) +R5∆eF = −R4 q , (93)
R4 ∆e (α∆eF )− (1 + ν)R4Ae(α ;F )−R ∆ew = 0 , (94)
26
where the operator Ae is defined by
Ae(a ; b) = (∆e a) (∆e b)− a,i,j b,i,j
=
(
∂2a
∂x2
)(
∂2b
∂y2
)
− 2

∂x∂y
)(
∂2b
∂x∂y
)
+
(
∂2a
∂y2
)(
∂2b
∂x2
)
.
Equation (94) gives a relation between the magnitudes of F and w:
O(R3 ∆eF ) ∼ O(w/α) .
In the large R limit, equation (93) thus becomes
∆e (D∆ew)− (1− ν)Ae(D ;w) = −q ,
which is the equation derived by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger [1964]. This equation
has been used by Stark et al. [2003], Kirby and Swain [2004] and Pe´rez-Gussinye´ et al. [2004]
for the local analysis of the lithosphere of the Earth. Its one-dimensional version, in which Ae
vanishes, has been used by Sandwell [1984] to describe the flexure of the oceanic lithosphere on
Earth.
5.3 Shell with constant thickness
If the thickness of the shell is constant, the toroidal part of the tangential displacement decouples.
The terms in B indeed drop from the flexure equations (62) and (71) so that the equations for
(w,F ) depend only on (q,Ω):
ηD′∆′∆′w − (1− ν) ηD′∆′w + ηR3 ∆′F = −R4 q +R3 ((1− η)∆Ω − 2ηΩ) , (95)
∆′∆′F − (1 + ν)∆′F − 1
Rα′
∆′w = −(1− ν)∆′ Ω , (96)
where we used the property A(a ; b) = a∆′b valid for constant a. This system of equations can
be decoupled into an equation relating w to (q,Ω),
ηD′∆∆′∆′w +
R2
α′
∆′w = −R4 (∆′ − 1− ν) q +R3
(

∆Ω , (97)
and an equation relating F to (w,Ω),
(
∆′ − 1− ν)∆′F = 1
Rα′
∆′w − (1− ν)∆′Ω . (98)
The elimination of ∆′F between equations (76) and (95) gives an equation relating the
consoidal displacement potential S to (w, q,Ω):
∆S = − 1
1 + ν
η′
ξ
∆∆′w +
1
ξ
∆′ w − 2w −R2 (1− ν)α q +R (1− η)α∆Ω .
Terms without derivatives can be eliminated with equation (97), so that we obtain an explicit
solution for S in terms of (w, q,Ω):
S =
η′

1− ν2
(
∆′ − 1 + ν)∆′w + w +R2α q −Rα
(
1
1 + ξ
∆− η − ν
)
Ω ,
27
where the integration constant has been set to zero.
Equations (53) and (77) give an equation for the toroidal displacement potential:
∆′ T = −2R (1 + ν) ηα V ,
where the integration constant has been set to zero. We have assumed that ∆V 6= 0, otherwise
we get ∆′T = 0.
Stresses can be computed either from equations (78) or (79).
The equations of this section agree with those of Kraus [1967] and Banerdt [1986] in the
limit of large ξ (see section 4.1), with one exception: both authors have (∆3 +4∆2)w instead of
∆∆′∆′w = (∆3 + 4∆2 + 4∆)w in equation (97) (Kraus makes the the mistake when combining
equations (95) and (96)). This error has propagated in many articles and is of consequence
for the degree-one harmonic component, since it violates the static assumption and spoils the
isostasy property discussed in section 4.3. Because of this mistake, many authors give a separate
treatment to the first harmonic degree.
Note that the definition of Kraus’ stress function F [Kraus , 1967, p. 243] differs from ours:
1
R2
FKraus = F − k(1− ν) D
R3
w ,
with k = 1, with the result that Kraus’ equations that include F differ from our. This freedom
of redefining F for arbitrary k remains as long as D is constant. The deflection equation for w,
equation (97), is unaffected so that the solution for w is unchanged.
The differential equations given in this section can be solved with spherical harmonics so
that the coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansions of (w,S, T ) can be expressed in terms
of the corresponding coefficients of the loads (q,Ω, V ) (see Kraus [1967], Turcotte et al. [1981],
Banerdt [1986]). With these explicit solutions, it is possible to check the thin shell assumption
stating that the transverse normal stress is negligible with respect to the tangential normal
stress. The magnitude of the former can be estimated by the load q (by its definition (30))
whereas the magnitude of the latter can be approximated with formulas (78) evaluated on the
outer surface:
σT ≡ 1

1
2h
∆′F +
E
2R(1− ν)
(

)
∆′w .
We can relate σT to q by using the solution in spherical harmonics of equations (97)-(98). Since
the thin shell assumption is expected to fail for a load of sufficiently small wavelength, we assume
that the spherical harmonic degree ℓ is large. Assuming the absence of tangential loads (Ω = 0)
and ℓ≫ 1, we obtain
(∆′F )ℓm ∼ 1
Rα
wℓm ,
wℓm ∼ − R
2α
1 + ℓ

qℓm ,
28
where the spherical harmonic coefficients are indexed by their degree ℓ and their order m. If
the shell is not in a membrane state of stress (see equation (92)), ℓ2 > 2R/h so that σT can be
approximated by
(σT )lm ∼ ξ
4ℓ2
qlm .
The thin shell assumption holds if q < σT , that is if
ℓ <
√
3
R
h
. (99)
This condition does not coincide with the one given in Willemann and Turcotte [1982], which
is ℓ < 2π
√
R/h. Though the stress distribution is affected, the limit (99) on the degree ℓ is not
important for the displacements, since they tend to zero at small wavelengths. The theory is
thus still valid at short wavelength if one is interested in the computation of the gravity field
associated to the transverse deflection of the lithosphere.
6 Conclusion
The principal results of this article are the five flexure equations (80)-(84) governing the three
displacements of the thin spherical shell and the two adjunct stress functions. Stresses are
derived quantities which can be obtained from equations (78) or (79). The shell thickness and
Young’s modulus can vary, but Poisson’s ratio must be constant. The loads acting on the shell
can be of any type since we extend the method of stress functions to include not only transverse
and consoidal tangential loads, but also toroidal tangential loads. The flexure equations can be
solved one after the other, except the two equations (81)-(82) for the transverse deflection w
and the stress function F , which must be simultaneously solved. Tangential loading is usually
neglected when solving for the deflection because of its small effect. In that case, it is sufficient
to solve the two equations (81)-(82) with Ω = H = 0. However tangential loading must be taken
into account when computing stress fields [Banerdt , 1986].
In the long-wavelength limit (i.e. membrane regime), all equations can be solved one after
the other because it is possible to solve for F before solving for the transverse deflection. If a
small part of the shell is considered, the flexure equations reduce to the equations governing the
deflection of a flat plate with variable thickness. If the shell thickness is constant, the flexure
equations reduce to equations available in the literature which can be completely solved with
spherical harmonics. Our rigorous treatment of the thin shell approximation has clarified the
full effect of the shell thickness on the flexure equations. We emphasize the need to use the
correct form for the equations (without the common mistake in the differential operator acting
on w) in order to have the correct properties for the first harmonic degree of the deflection.
We have also obtained two general properties of the flexure equations. First we have shown
that there is always a toroidal component in the tangential displacement if the shell thickness
is variable. Second we have proven that the degree-one harmonic components of the transverse
deflection do not depend on the elastic properties of the shell. If the sphere is filled with a fluid,
29
these components are the solutions of the global equilibrium equation for the external forces
(i.e. the forces acting on the exterior boundary of the shell plus the forces exerted by the fluid).

7 Appendix
7.1 Covariant, contravariant and normalized components
Tensors can be defined by their transformation law under changes of coordinates. The two types
of tensor components, namely covariant and contravariant components, transform in a reciprocal
way under changes of coordinates. Tensor components cannot be expressed in a normalized basis:
the space must have a coordinate vector basis (for contravariant components) and a dual basis
(for covariant components), which are not normalized. The only exception is a flat space with
Cartesian coordinates, where covariant, contravariant and normalized components are identical.
Since the metric is the scalar product of the elements of the coordinate vector basis, the
covariant components are related to components defined in a normalized basis (written with a
hat) by
ui =
√
gii uˆi ,
whereas the relation for contravariant components is
ui =
1√
gii
uˆi .
The normalized Cartesian basis (xˆ, yˆ, zˆ) and the normalized basis for spherical coordinates
(ˆr, θˆ, ϕˆ) are related by
xˆ = cos θ cosϕ θˆ − sinϕ ϕˆ+ sin θ cosϕ rˆ ,
yˆ = cos θ sinϕ θˆ + cosϕ ϕˆ+ sin θ sinϕ rˆ , (100)
zˆ = − sin θ θˆ + cos θ rˆ .
7.2 Covariant derivatives
Usual derivatives are indicated by a ‘comma’:
vi,j =
∂vi
∂xj
.
Covariant derivatives (defined below) are indicated by a ‘bar’ or by the operator ∇i:
vi|j = ∇j vi .
30
The former notation emphasizes the tensorial character of the covariant derivative since the
covariant derivative adds a covariant index to the vector. The latter notation is more adapted
when we are interested by the properties of the operator.
The covariant derivative of a scalar function f is equal to the usual derivative, f|i = f,i, and
is itself a covariant vector: f|i = vi. Covariant derivatives on covariant and contravariant vector
components are defined by
vi|j = vi,j − Γkij vk , (101)
vi |j = v
i
,j + Γ
i
jk v
k , (102)
where the summation on repeated indices is implicit. The symbols Γkij are the Christoffel symbols
of the second kind [Synge and Schild , 1978]. Their expressions for the metrics used in this article
are given in sections 7.3 and 7.4.
Covariant differentiation of higher order tensors is explained in Synge and Schild [1978] but
we only need the rule for a covariant tensor of second order:
σij|k = σij,k − Γlik σlj − Γljk σil .
If some of the indices of the tensor are contravariant, the rule is changed according to equation
(102). The covariant derivatives of the metric and of the inverse metric are zero: gij|k = 0 and
gij|k = 0.
7.3 Three-dimensional spherical geometry
The geometry of a thin spherical shell of average radius R can be described with coordinates θ,
ϕ and ζ, respectively representing the colatitude, longitude and radial coordinates. The radial
coordinate ζ is zero on the reference surface (i.e. the sphere of radius R) of the shell. The
non-zero components of the metric are given by
gθθ = (R + ζ)
2 ,
gϕϕ = (R + ζ)
2 sin2 θ ,
gζζ = 1 .
The non-zero Christoffel symbols are given by
Γζθθ = −(R+ ζ) ,
Γζϕϕ = −(R+ ζ) sin2 θ ,
Γθζθ = Γ
θ
θζ = Γ
ϕ
ζϕ = Γ
ϕ
ϕζ =
1
R+ ζ
,
Γθϕϕ = − sin θ cos θ ,
Γϕϕθ = Γ
ϕ
θϕ = cot θ .
31
7.4 Two-dimensional spherical geometry
If θ and ϕ respectively represent the colatitude and longitude coordinates, the non-zero compo-
nents of the metric on the surface of the sphere are given by
gθθ = 1 ,
gϕϕ = sin
2 θ . (103)
The non-zero Christoffel symbols are given by
Γθϕϕ = − sin θ cos θ ,
Γϕϕθ = Γ
ϕ
θϕ = cot θ .
The double covariant derivatives of a scalar function f are thus given by
f|θ|θ = f,θ,θ ,
f|θ|ϕ = f|ϕ|θ = f,θ,ϕ − cot θ f,ϕ ,
f|ϕ|ϕ = f,ϕ,ϕ + sin θ cos θ f,θ .
An antisymmetric tensor εij is defined by
εij ≡
√
det gij ε¯ij ,
where ε¯ij is the antisymmetric symbol invariant under coordinate transformations: ε¯θϕ = −ε¯ϕθ =
1, ε¯θθ = ε¯ϕϕ = 0 (ε¯ij is usually called a tensor density; Synge and Schild [1978] call it a relative
tensor of weight -1). The non-zero covariant components of εij are given for the metric of the
spherical surface by
εθϕ = −εϕθ = sin θ .
The non-zero contravariant components, εij = gikgjlεkl, are given by
εθϕ = −εϕθ = csc θ .
The covariant derivative of the tensor εij is zero: εij|k = 0.
7.5 Gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian
Various differential operators on the surface of the sphere can be constructed with covariant
derivatives. In this section, f and t are scalar functions defined on the sphere and v is a vector
tangent to the sphere. Backus [1986] gives more details on surface operators and on Helmholtz’s
theorem.
As mentioned in Appendix 7.2, the covariant derivative of a scalar function f defined on
the sphere is a covariant vector tangent to the sphere whose components are f,θ and f,ϕ. The
surface gradient of f is the same vector with its components expressed in the normalized basis
(θˆ, ϕˆ):
∇¯f = f,θ θˆ + csc θ f,ϕ ϕˆ . (104)
32
The contraction of the covariant derivative with the components of a vector v yields a
scalar:
vi |i = v
θ
,θ + cot θ v
θ + vϕ,ϕ .
The surface divergence is the corresponding operation on the vector with its components ex-
pressed in the normalized basis (θˆ, ϕˆ):
∇¯ · v = csc θ
(
(sin θ vˆθ),θ + vˆϕ,ϕ
)
. (105)
Since the result is a scalar, vi |i = ∇¯ · v. A useful identity is
∇¯ · (f v) = ∇¯f · v + f ∇¯ · v . (106)
The contraction of the antisymmetric tensor εij with the covariant derivative of a scalar t
yields the covariant components of a vector v:
vi = g
jk εik t,j .
The components are given for the metric (103) by vθ = csc θ t,ϕ and vϕ = − sin θ t,θ. If t is
considered as the radial component of the radial vector t = trˆ (the covariant radial component is
equal to the normalized one), vi are the non-zero covariant components of the three-dimensional
curl of t, which is tangent to the sphere. This fact justifies the definition of the surface curl of
t, which is equal to the vector v but with components given in the normalized basis (θˆ, ϕˆ):
∇¯ × t = csc θ t,ϕ θˆ − t,θ ϕˆ .
The contraction of the double covariant derivative acting on a scalar f defines the surface
Laplacian:
∆f = gij f|i|j
= f,θ,θ + cot θ f,θ + csc
2 θ f,ϕ,ϕ . (107)
The surface Laplacian can also be seen as the composition of the surface divergence with the
surface gradient: ∆f = ∇¯ · ∇¯f .
According to Helmholtz’s theorem, a vector tangent to the sphere can be written as the
sum of the surface gradient of a scalar f and the surface curl of a radial vector t rˆ:
v = ∇¯f + ∇¯ × (t rˆ) ,
While t is always called the toroidal scalar (or potential) for v, there is no standard terminology
for f . Backus [1986] calls f the consoidal scalar for v. Some authors [e.g. Banerdt , 1986] call
f the poloidal potential for v. The origin of this use lies in the theory of mantle convection,
in which plate tectonics are assumed to be driven by mantle flow. Under the assumption of an
incompressible mantle fluid, the velocity field of the fluid is solenoidal, i.e. its 3-dimensional
divergence vanishes. In such a case, the velocity field can be decomposed into a poloidal part
33
(∇×∇× (P rˆ)) and a toroidal part (∇× (Qrˆ)), where differential operators are 3-dimensional
[Backus , 1986]. If the velocity field is tangent to the spherical surface, the poloidal component
at the surface is also the consoidal component [Forte and Peltier , 1987]. However the fields for
which we use Helmholtz’s theorem, i.e. the tangential surface load and the tangential surface
displacement, do not belong to 3-dimensional solenoidal vector fields. We thus prefer to use the
term ‘solenoidal’.
The surface divergence of v depends only on the consoidal scalar f :
∇¯ · v = ∆f . (108)
The two-dimensional version of Gauss theorem is∫
S
dω ∇¯ · v = 0 . (109)
where dω = sin θ dθ dϕ and the integral is taken over the whole spherical surface. It can be
proven with formula (105).
7.6 Differential identities for the operators Oi
The differential operators Oi defined by equations (16) satisfy differential identities useful when
obtaining the flexure equations. They are special cases of differential identities valid in curved
spaces. The presence of curvature makes the parallel transport of vectors path-dependent; this
property quantifies the curvature of space and can be expressed as the lack of commutativity of
the covariant derivatives of a vector v:
vi|j|k − vi|k|j = Riljk vl , (110)
where Riljk are the covariant components of the Riemann tensor. On the sphere, the Rie-
mann tensor has only one independent component that is non-zero, Rθϕθϕ = − sin2 θ. Other
components are related by the symmetries Rαβγδ = −Rβαγδ = −Rαβδγ = Rγδαβ .
The substitution of f,i to vi in the commutation relation (110) provides two differential
identities satisfied by double covariant derivatives acting on scalar functions:
(
csc θ f|ϕ|ϕ
)
,θ
− csc θ f|ϕ|θ,ϕ − cos θ f|θ|θ + sin θ f,θ = 0 ,
f|θ|θ,ϕ − f|ϕ|θ,θ − cot θ f|ϕ|θ + f,ϕ = 0 .
The replacement in the above equations of the double covariant derivatives by the normal-
ized differential operators (35) yields the following identities:
(sin θO2f),θ − (O3f),ϕ − cos θO1f = 0 (I1) , (111)
(sin θO3f),θ − (O1f),ϕ + cos θO3f = 0 (I2) . (112)
These identities can also be directly checked with the definitions (16) of the operators Oi.
34
The identities (I1)-(I2) can be differentiated to generate identities of higher order. A first
useful identity is obtained from sin θ(I1),θ − (I2),ϕ = 0:
csc2 θ
((
sin2 θ (O2f),θ
)
,θ
+ (O1f),ϕ,ϕ − 2
(
sin θ (O3f),ϕ
)
,θ
)
− cot θ (O1f),θ + 2O1f = ∆′f . (113)
A second useful identity is obtained from (I1),ϕ + sin θ(I2),θ = 0:
csc2 θ
((
sin2 θ (O3f),θ
)
,θ
− (O3f),ϕ,ϕ +
(
sin θ ((O2 −O1) f),ϕ
)
,θ
)
+cot θ (O3f),θ − 2O3f = 0 . (114)
7.7 No degree one in operators A and B
We want to prove that the operators A and B defined by equations (37) and (41) do not have
a degree-one term in their spherical harmonic expansion:∫
S
dω A(a ; b)Y ∗1p = 0 (p = −1, 0, 1) , (115)∫
S
dω B(a ; b)Y ∗1p = 0 (p = −1, 0, 1) , (116)
where (a, b) are arbitrary scalar functions on the sphere, dω = sin θ dθ dϕ and the integral is
taken over the whole spherical surface.
This property is not a straightforward consequence of constructing A and B with Dij as
a building block. Although A and B can be factored into terms without degree one (such as
Dija or ∆′a), the product of the factors may contain a degree-one term in its spherical harmonic
expansion.
Without loss of generality, we can prove the above identities with the arguments (a, b)
being spherical harmonics of given degree and order. The general result is then obtained by
superposition. Let a and b be spherical harmonics of order m and n: a ∼ eimϕ and b ∼ einϕ (we
will not use their harmonic degree in the proof). The operators A and B can be expressed in
terms of usual derivatives by inserting the definitions (16) of Oi into the expressions (37)-(41).
All derivatives with respect to ϕ in the operators A and B can then be replaced with the rules
a,ϕ → ima and b,ϕ → inb. The integral over ϕ gives
∫ 2π
0
dϕ ei(m+n−p)ϕ = 2π δm+n−p,0 ,
so that the integral is zero unless n = p−m.
First consider the case p = 0 (n = −m), that is the projection on the zonal spherical
harmonic of degree one. We thus have to calculate
∫ π
0 dθ A0 and
∫ π
0 dθ B0 with
A0 ≡ sin θ cos θA(a ; b) ,
B0 ≡ sin θ cos θB(a ; b) .
35
The trick consists in rewriting the integrands as total derivatives:
A0 =
(
cos2 θ a,θ b,θ + cot θ
(
sin2 θ −m2) (ab),θ + (sin2 θ +m2 csc2 θ cos 2θ) ab
)
,θ
,
B0 = −im
(
cos θ a,θ b,θ + sin θ a b,θ − csc θ cos2 θ a,θ b+ cos θ a b,θ,θ
)
,θ
,
The sought integrals are thus given by∫ π
0
dθ A0 =
[
a,θ b,θ −m2 cot θ (ab),θ +m2 csc2 θ ab
]π
0
,
∫ π
0
dθ B0 = −im
[
cos θ a,θ b,θ − csc θ a,θ b+ cos θ a b,θ,θ
]π
0
,
where we have dropped the terms containing at least one power of sin θ which vanish at the
limits; we have also replaced cos2 θ and cos 2θ by their value at the limits. The remaining terms
can be evaluated by recalling the dependence in sin θ of the spherical harmonics: a = (sin θ)|m| a0
and b = (sin θ)|m| b0, where a0 and b0 are polynomials in cos θ. The only non-zero terms at the
limits of the integrals are those for |m| = 1, in which case we have at the limits: a,θb,θ = a0b0,
cot θ (ab),θ = 2a0b0, csc
2 θ ab = a0b0, csc θ a,θb = cos θ a0b0, ab,θ,θ = 0. However these terms
cancel in the sums so that the integrals vanish for all m. This completes the proof for the case
p = 0.
Now consider the case p = ±1 (n = −m±1), that is the projections on the sectoral spherical
harmonics of degree one. We thus have to calculate
∫ π
0 dθ A±1 and
∫ π
0 dθ B±1 with
A±1 ≡ sin2 θA(a ; b) ,
B±1 ≡ sin2 θB(a ; b) .
We again write the integrands as total derivatives:
A±1 =
(
sin θ cos θ a,θ b,θ −
(
sin θ cos θ +m2
)
(ab),θ −
(
cos2 θ ∓ 2m) a,θ b
+ sin2 θ a b,θ + 2m(m∓ 1) cot θ ab
)
,θ
,
B±1 = −i
(
(m∓ 1) sin θ a,θ b,θ +m sin θ a b,θ,θ − (m∓ 1) cos θ a,θ b
−m cos θ a b,θ −m(1∓m) csc θ ab
)
,θ
.
The sought integrals are thus given by∫ π
0
dθ A±1 =
[
−m2 (ab),θ − (1∓ 2m) a,θ b+ 2m(m∓ 1) cot θ ab
]π
0
,
∫ π
0
dθ B±1 = i
[
(m∓ 1) cos θ a,θ b+m cos θ a b,θ +m(1∓m) csc θ ab
]π
0
,
where we have dropped the terms containing at least one power of sin θ and replaced cos2 θ by
its value at the limits. The remaining terms can be evaluated as in the case p = 0, but with
a = (sin θ)|m| a0 and b = (sin θ)
|m∓1| b0. All terms give zero at the limits of the integrals for all
values of m. This completes the proof for the case p = ±1. We have thus proven the identities
(115)-(116).
