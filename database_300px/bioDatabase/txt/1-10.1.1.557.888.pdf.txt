ABSTRACT: Extremely preterm infants are at risk for neurodevel-
opmental problems and the visual system is particularly vulnerable.
However, development of visual function in preterm infants with
little or no retinal or neurologic injury has not been well defined. This
study compared development of visual function in preterm infants
without severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular
hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) to that of
term infants at 5–7 mo corrected age. Twenty-one very low birth
weight (VLBW) preterm infants (24–32 wk gestational age, weigh-
ing  1500 g), and 22 healthy term infants were tested at 5–7 mo
corrected age. Infants with any IVH/PVL and Stage II ROP or Plus
disease were excluded. Contrast sensitivity, grating acuity, and ver-
nier acuity were measured using swept-parameter visual evoked
potentials. Thresholds and maximum amplitudes were compared
between groups. VLBW and term infants showed no differences in
sensitivity for contrast (67.5 versus 63.8), grating resolution (12.4
versus 12.5 cpd) or vernier acuity (1.2 versus 1.0 arcmin). However,
the amplitudes for swept contrast (p  0.03) and swept vernier offset
(p  0.04) stimuli were higher in VLBW infants. Visual thresholds
in VLBW infants without serious retinal or neurologic abnormalities
were not significantly different from those of term infants, suggesting
that increased visual experience does not influence visual sensitivity.
The higher amplitudes in VLBW infants, suggests that visual expe-
rience may affect responses to suprathreshold stimuli. (Pediatr Res
60: 435–439, 2006)
Preterm infants are at higher risk for visual and otherneurodevelopmental problems compared with infants born
full-term (1–7). Those who are very low birth weight (VLBW
 1500) are at particularly high risk due to an increased
prevalence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (2,5,6,8,9),
intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and periventricular leu-
komalacia (PVL), among other complications (6,7,10–14).
One area of the brain that is particularly vulnerable during the
prenatal and neonatal period is the primary visual pathway
(from the retina to the visual cortex) because it undergoes
significant development during this time (15–19) and there-
fore may be vulnerable to disruption by perinatal events.
Several studies have shown an increased incidence of visual
impairment with ROP (1,3,20,21) and with periventricular
leukomalacia or hemorrhagic lesions (10–13). A number of
studies have also demonstrated the co-existence of visual
impairment in preterm infants with other neurologic deficits
(4,6,14).
One issue that has not been adequately addressed has been
whether visual problems in premature infants result solely
from the effects of morbidity (e.g. ROP, IVH or PVL), or
whether premature exposure to the visual world in itself may
influence visual functioning. Studies using behavioral tech-
niques have shown either no trend (22), a trend toward rapid
development (23), or reduced acuity with preterm birth (24–
26), while those employing electrophysiological techniques
have shown either no trend (27) or a trend toward a more rapid
maturation in preterm infants (28–31). However, research on
this question is inconclusive because these studies have not
excluded infants with ROP or cerebral lesions and have
typically included a wide range of gestational ages from
26–36 wk. No study, to our knowledge, has examined visual
functioning in a group of VLBW infants excluding for detect-
able cerebral abnormalities and significant ROP. Only by
testing such a group can the effects of premature visual
exposure alone be investigated.
Most previous studies have relied on a single measure to
assess functioning of the entire visual system. If the effects of
prematurity on visual pathway development are selective, as
has been suggested (31,32), then a measure of a single visual
function may fail to identify problems, or may not identify
maximal differences. A more useful strategy would be to
evaluate a number of different visual functions.
In the present study we assessed visual functioning in
VLBW infants using the sweep visual evoked potential
(sVEP) technique. This technique offers a quantitative elec-
trophysiological method to assess the response to different
types of visual stimuli by determining a sensory threshold
(i.e., the smallest stimulus that produces a cortical visual
response) as well as response amplitudes (i.e., the strength of
the response) to suprathreshold stimuli (33). Visual thresholds
are sensitive measures of visual function and may provide

independent information relative to suprathreshold measures
such as the response amplitude to a clearly visual stimulus.
The three different visual thresholds that were measured by
this technique were contrast sensitivity, grating acuity and
vernier acuity, each of which has different rates of develop-
ment and has been studied extensively (34,35). Contrast sen-
sitivity measures the ability to detect slight changes in lumi-
nance across space. It is the first of the three functions to
mature, with sensitivity being half that of adult sensitivity by
three months of age (34,36). Grating acuity is a test of spatial
resolution, and measures the finest grating that can be re-
solved. Grating acuity thresholds reach half of adult values by
eight months of age (37). Vernier acuity measures the mini-
mum offset that can be detected between two line segments.
Vernier acuity as measured by the sVEP is relatively poor
during the first year of life (35). Behavioral and sVEP methods
have shown that vernier thresholds reach approximately half
of adult values by five years of age (38,39). Vernier acuity,
since it requires recognition of spatial relationships, is be-
lieved to require a greater degree of cortical processing, and be
a more meaningful indicator of higher-order visual cognitive
function than other visual functions (35).
The goal of this study was to determine whether premature
birth itself, in the absence of significant retinal or cerebral
pathology, contributes significantly to alterations in visual
development either by accelerating or delaying development.
METHODS
Participants. Twenty-one VLBW and 22 term control infants were each
tested between five and seven months corrected age. Information regarding
birth weight and gestation for the VLBW group was obtained from the
medical record. Infants included in the VLBW group were 24–32 wk
gestation, and weighed less than 1500 g (mean  SD, 1102  218.5g). The
mean post-conceptional age of VLBW infants was 63.5  4.3 wk (mean 
SD) and mean chronologic age was 34.9  4.8 wk. Gestational age was
assessed by the best obstetrical estimate using the last menstrual period and
ultrasound examination. Mean chronologic age of the term infants was 26.9
5.6 wk (67 wk post-conceptual age). Term infants were either self-referred by
parents interested in participating or referred by pediatricians aware of the
study. Data regarding the highest degree of ROP was recorded by the
ophthalmologist, and IVH or PVL was determined by a head ultrasound
examination, as recorded in the medical record. Inclusion criteria for VLBW
infants included  than Stage II ROP, no Plus disease and no IVH or PVL.
Of the four study infants who had ROP, three had Stage I and one had Stage
II. Term infants were assumed to be appropriate for gestational age based on
information regarding date of birth and neonatal course obtained from parents.
The Institutional Review Board for human subject research at Stanford
University approved the study. Signed informed consent was obtained from
the parents of the enrolled infants after explanation of the study procedures.
EEG recording. The EEG (EEG) signal was amplified using a Grass
Model 12 amplifier (filter settings: 1–100 Hz at 6 dB) at a gain of 20,000.
Active electrodes were placed over the infant’s scalp at the occipital pole
(location Oz, of the International 10-20 system) and at locations 3 cm to the
left and right of Oz (O1 and O2) to record evoked potentials (40). A reference
electrode was placed at Cz and a ground electrode was placed at Pz (50 and
30% of the inion-nasion distance at midline, respectively). Electrode imped-
ance was equal to or less than 5 k. Data acquisition and stimulus presen-
tation were controlled using an in-house software system (37,41).
Stimulus presentation. Stimuli were presented on a high-bandwidth
monochrome monitor (MR2000HB-MED, Richardson Electronics) at a
screen resolution of 1600 1200 pixels and a 60-Hz vertical refresh rate. The
display was calibrated using a linear PIN-diode photometer with a photopic
filter. The photo-diode was used to measure the luminance of a 5  5-cm2
region of the display monitor. The luminance of this region was incremented
in 128 steps over the 256 available voltage levels of the video card. These
values were used to correct the nonlinear voltage to luminance function in
software. The contrast of each spatial frequency was not measured.
The effect of the monitor on high spatial frequencies is small with the
display used. The monitor has a very high video bandwidth and patterns were
displayed at 1600  1200 screen resolution. The slight reduction in contrast
that occurs at the highest spatial frequencies would have affected both groups
of infants and should not have affected the results reported, especially given
the relative steepness of the high spatial frequency portion of the contrast
sensitivity function. There is no attenuation at the low spatial frequencies used
to measure contrast sensitivity or vernier acuity.
The nonlinear relationship between voltage and luminance was corrected
in software. Mean luminance of the display was 102 cd/m2. A small toy,
dangled 0–2 cm from the screen, directed the infant’s attention to the monitor
for the duration of the trials, each of which lasted 10 s. Viewing was binocular
and the infants viewed the screen from 100 cm while seated in their parent’s
lap.
Contrast sensitivity was measured by presenting a phase-reversing, 2
cycles per degree (cpd) sine wave grating that was swept from 0.5–20%
contrast over the 10-s trial. Grating acuity was measured with an 80% contrast
that was swept from 2–16 cpd. Vernier acuity was measured using a 2 cpd,
80% contrast grating into which vernier displacements were periodically
introduced and removed. The size of the vernier displacements was swept
from 8 to 0.5 arc minutes. All stimuli were modulated at 3.76 Hz. A schematic
illustration of the three sweep types is shown in Fig. 1.
Sweep VEP analysis. The sweep VEP technique has been described in
detail previously (37,42). Briefly, VEP response amplitude is measured as a
stimulus parameter such as contrast, spatial frequency or vernier displacement
is varied continuously over a range covering both below- and above-threshold
values. The stimulus is presented at a given temporal frequency (3.76 Hz in
this study), that drives visual cortical neurons at that frequency, and exact
integer multiples of that frequency, as long as the stimulus is in the visible
range. The visual response synchronized to the display is sampled with
appropriately positioned leads, and the VEP amplitude versus stimulus inten-
sity function is measured as the stimulus-driven response drops into the
background EEG noise. In this study, sweeps were repeated several times
(4–8) to increase the signal to noise ratio through averaging out the uncor-
related background EEG activity. Thresholds were estimated by extrapolating
the suprathreshold portion of the response function to zero amplitude using
linear regression as described below.
To measure the response functions, EEG recordings from the scalp for
each 10-s trial were digitized and divided into 10 sequential epochs or “bins”
of one-second duration. For each bin, a recursive, least-squares algorithm (41)
was used to generate a series of complex-valued spectral coefficients repre-
senting the amplitude and phase of response components tuned to various
multiples (harmonics) of the stimulus frequency. These spectral coefficients
for each bin were averaged together across trials for each subject, channel,
harmonic, and stimulus condition. Statistical significance for each bin was
quantified using p-values derived from the circular T (T2 circ) statistic (43),
which tests whether a given response amplitude is significantly different from
zero taking into account both response amplitude and phase consistency
across trials.
Figure 1. Schematic diagrams of visual stimuli. The sweep VEP measures
thresholds by varying or “sweeping” the stimulus parameter. To determine
contrast sensitivity, grating acuity and vernier acuity, the contrast, spatial
frequency and the line offset, respectively, were varied over 10-s intervals.
Contrast was swept from 0.5–20%, spatial frequency was swept from 2–16
cpb and vernier offset was swept from 8–0.5 arc minutes.

Threshold estimation. The range of bins used for regression depended on
the statistical significance and phase-consistency of the response across bins
according to an algorithm adapted from Norcia et al. (37). Once the regression
range was established, the threshold stimulus value was determined by
extrapolating the regression line to zero response amplitude. Figure 2 shows
the extrapolation of the second harmonic amplitude function to estimate a
grating acuity threshold for an individual participant. The first harmonic
(3.76 Hz) was used to estimate vernier thresholds because that harmonic has
been shown to be specific for relative position (35,44) and the second
harmonic (7.52 Hz) was used to estimate contrast sensitivity and grating
acuity thresholds as the second harmonic is the dominant component of the
reversal response.
Amplitude and phase analysis. The amplitude for each one-second bin in
the trial was averaged across subjects to calculate response functions for each
group (Fig. 3). Finally, we also measured the response timing for each of the
three measures by comparing the phases between the groups. We used the
phase from the bin with the highest amplitude since this is the most statisti-
cally reliable datum. Phase differences were tested using the complex ampli-
tudes (43).
Statistical analysis. All threshold scores were converted to log values
before conducting analyses. The mean threshold and amplitude values for
each function measured were compared using the independent sample t-tests.
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, thresholds for the three measures were
remarkably similar between the two groups. There were no
significant differences on any of the threshold measures. A
power analysis indicated that, given our sample sizes and the
SD of the measures, we should have been able to detect 10%
or smaller differences in each of the thresholds, if these
differences were present. To detect a threshold difference of
10% between premature and control infants for p  0.05 and
power 0.80 would require approximately 20 subjects for con-
trast sensitivity, 15 for grating, and 18 for vernier acuity. To
detect a 25% difference would require 10 infants for contrast
sensitivity, 6 for grating, and 9 for vernier acuities (also 80%
power). This small sample size assumes that standard devia-
tions were intermediate between those observed in controls
and those observed in prematures.
A comparison of response phase (Table 2) showed no
differences between the two groups.
We also compared the amplitude of the averaged response
functions for the two groups (Fig. 3). Only those bins that
were used to extrapolate thresholds (based on the average
threshold for each group) were included in the analysis. Since
thresholds were identical between the groups, the identical
bins were compared. There was a significant difference in
response amplitude between the groups for contrast sensitivity
(p  0.04) and vernier acuity (p  0.02). In both cases the
preterm group displayed higher amplitudes. Although the
preterm group had higher amplitude in the grating acuity
condition, this difference was not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
The contrast sensitivity, grating acuity, and vernier acuity in
this cohort of 5–7 mo adjusted age VLBW infants were
comparable to that of term infants of similar age. These results
suggest that premature birth in the absence of identifiable
retinal or neurologic abnormalities does not have a detrimental
effect on visual sensitivity at age 5–7 mo as indexed by
threshold measures. Our results also demonstrate that earlier
exposure to visual stimuli as occurs in preterm infants does
not accelerate these abilities either, as has been suggested by
pattern VEP studies with older preterm infants (30). Infants in
the VLBW group had up to 16 wk of additional visual
experience compared with the term group, and yet we found
no evidence of improved thresholds.
Visual development as measured by thresholds appears to
be regulated by a biologic clock, i.e., maturation of various
visual functions is predetermined per a temporal schedule.
Early exposure to visual stimuli experienced by these infants
did not affect the threshold performance of the visual system.
There remains the possibility that since the mean post-
conceptional age of the term infants was 4 wk higher than that
of the preterm infants, that the VLBW group would have
performed better on all measures if the ages had been more
similar. Another possible explanation for the results is that the
cohort of preterm infants in the study may not have been as
homogenous as assumed at the time of enrollment by virtue of
having a normal head ultrasound and less than stage II ROP.
Some of the infants may have had subtle neurologic damage
that was undetected by the imaging modalities that were used.
Although thresholds were unaffected, preterm birth did
affect the strength of the neuronal signal in the contrast and
vernier displacement sweeps, with premature infants showing
significantly higher amplitudes. There is a nonsignificant trend
in the spatial frequency tuning function for higher amplitudes
in the preterm group at the lowest spatial frequencies. The

437PRETERM VISUAL DEVELOPMENT
lowest spatial frequency in the spatial frequency sweep was
also used for the contrast sensitivity and vernier acuity mea-
surements. It is possible that the higher amplitudes of the
preterm infants reflect accelerated visual cortical development
of suprathreshold (low spatial frequency) mechanisms not
responsible for the infants’ thresholds. It may also be that the
increased amplitudes reflect a hyperexcitability in the prema-
ture infants, possibly from an alteration of inhibitory neuron
function in the visual cortex. Perhaps both accelerated cortical
development and hyperexcitability are spatial frequency de-
pendent. The visual pathway contains gamma aminobutyric
acid (GABA) as its main inhibitory neurotransmitter and
GABA plays a critical role in many neurodevelopmental
processes (in addition to transmission) including the regula-
tion of neuronal survival, dendrite and axonal maturation, and
neuronal plasticity (44–46). Thus, disruptions in cortical de-
velopment in visual cortex may be selectively affecting
GABAergic neurons, resulting in a higher than normal neu-
ronal signal. But again, if this is the case, it does not appear to
directly affect infant thresholds.
In conclusion, we found that VLBW infants with no IVH or
PVL on a head ultrasound and only mild or no ROP are
largely spared from major disruptions in visual system func-
tion. We found no differences from age-matched term infants
on three different measures of visual function. Since we
observed no visual deficits these current data support that
visual system disruption often seen during prematurity is
predominantly affected by severe retinopathy or significant
cerebral abnormalities. However, a single-point measurement
may not necessarily be representative of the entire spectrum of
visual development. Therefore it is important to follow these
infants longitudinally through the first few years of childhood.
Data from serial examinations, vision screening at older ages
and, developmental follow up will be important to understand
the effect of premature birth on visual development. In addi-
tion, further research with this cohort during early childhood
will determine whether the higher than normal amplitudes in
the premature group are clinically significant or related to any
lasting effects on visual function.
