[1] We have utilized optical constants derived from thermal infrared spectra acquired by
the Mariner 9 Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (M9 IRIS) and Mars Global Surveyor
Thermal Emission Spectrometer (MGS TES), during periods of relatively high dust/low
water ice opacity, to generate synthetic transmission and emission spectra of the
atmospheric dust. Using libraries of transmission and emission spectra of common rock-
forming minerals and their alteration products, we applied a linear deconvolution
algorithm to the spectra to model the dust mineralogy. Models of the M9 IRIS
transmission data generally are of poor quality, and the mineralogical results of these fits
are unlikely to be valid. Fits to the TES transmission spectrum and TES and IRIS emission
spectra are of better quality and suggest that the dust mineralogy is dominated by
framework silicates (feldspar and/or zeolite) with carbonate, sulfate, pyroxene, and
olivine, identified near, but below, generalized detection limits. Evidence for
phyllosilicates is not robust. Our results, combined with those from in situ measurements
and other visible to infrared spectral studies, suggest that framework silicates (probably
feldspar) dominate the dust mineralogy, with lesser amounts of olivine, pyroxene,
amorphous material, hematite, and magnetite, and that the dust largely is the product of
mechanical weathering of basaltic rocks with minor chemical alteration.

1. Introduction
[2] The earliest observers of Mars noted, in addition to its
remarkable ‘‘redness’’, that ‘‘bright’’ and ‘‘dark’’ regions
could be discerned on the planet. More quantitative obser-
vations of visible albedo and thermophysical properties,
enabled by high spectral and spatial resolution telescopic
and robotic exploration, have revealed that mobile sand and
other coarse materials dominate the darker regions, whereas
the brighter regions likely are dominated by fine particulates
(e.g., dust). The surface dust presumably is the product of
mechanical and/or chemical weathering of coarser surface
materials circulated by regional and global dust storms
[Pleskot and Miner, 1981; Christensen, 1988]. The coarse
nature of materials in the dark regions makes it relatively
easy to determine compositional information via remote
spectroscopic methods. The nature of dusty materials, on
the other hand, presents some significant challenges to the
determination of their mineralogy. Although numerous
inferences have been made about the mineralogy of Martian
surface dust from visible and near-infrared spectral obser-
vations (summarized by Bell [1996] and Bell et al. [2000]),
direct determination has been hampered by spectral mask-
ing due to fine-grained ferric oxides. At thermal infrared
wavelengths, scattering effects dominate observations of
dust on the surface and, until recently [Bandfield and Smith,
2003], have complicated significantly the interpretation of
the surface dust spectrum. Our limited understanding of the
minerals that constitute the dust and surficial soils hampers
our understanding of Martian weathering processes and
conditions.
[3] The physical and/or chemical processes that produced
the surface dust, and the environmental conditions under
which these processes took place, determined its current
mineralogy. Soils measured by the Viking landers originally
were interpreted primarily as mixtures of clay minerals
(Fe-bearing smectites) and Fe oxides formed by chemical
weathering and cemented into duricrust by salts [Toulmin et
al., 1977; Gooding, 1992]. Spectral features resulting from
Fe3+ provide evidence for hematite, but features of crys-
talline silicates have not been confidently identified in

visible and near-infrared spectral observations of dusty
regions, leading to the suggestion that the soils largely
are composed of chemically weathered, amorphous or
poorly crystalline materials [e.g., Bell, 1996]. In contrast,
Mars Pathfinder soil compositions commonly have been
modeled as comminuted igneous rocks (mixtures of basalt
and andesite) formed by mechanical weathering [Larsen et
al., 2000; Morris et al., 2000; Wa¨nke et al., 2001], and
appear to contain a ferric pigment of poorly crystalline,
nanometer-sized oxide particles dispersed within a silicate
matrix [Bell et al., 2000], likely hematite [e.g., Morris et
al., 1989; Bell et al., 1990]. This mixed ferric oxide-silicate
composition also is characteristic of the atmospheric dust,
based on its magnetic [Madsen et al., 1999; Goetz et al.,
2005] and near-infrared spectral [Bell et al., 2000] proper-
ties. Specifically, results from the magnetic properties
experiments on the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) have
been interpreted to indicate that the atmospheric dust
contains magnetite as the primary magnetic phase and is
the product of mechanical weathering of a basaltic protolith
with simultaneous or subsequent oxidation [Goetz et al.,
2005]. McSween and Keil [2000] estimated the chemical
composition of the global dust from the least-cemented
Viking soil and the Pathfinder soil with the smallest
admixture of the local andesitic rock. They interpreted this
dust composition as basalt weathered in an aqueous envi-
ronment, producing poorly crystalline material similar to
palagonite. Palagonitic tephra is the best analog for visible
and near-infrared spectra of bright (dust covered) regions
on Mars [Morris et al., 1990; Bell et al., 1993], although it
is not a good thermal infrared spectral analogue [Hamilton
and Morris, 2003]. Martian soils also may have experi-
enced aeolian fractionations of dense oxide phases
[McLennan, 2000]. Observations of a strong 3-mm hydrated
mineral feature suggest the presence of OH and/or H2O in
the dust [Houck et al., 1973; Bell and Crisp, 1993; Murchie
et al., 1993], possibly in the form of clay minerals,
palagonite, and hydrous carbonates, and analysis of reflec-
tance spectra is consistent with up to 4 wt.% H2O in
Martian soils [Yen et al., 1998]. Bandfield and Smith
[2003] produced shapes of thermal infrared spectra high
albedo (dusty) Martian surfaces, and found that the spectra
of these surfaces have features consistent with materials
dominated by silicates. No single phase matches the
surface dust spectrum uniquely, but features consistent with
intermediate to calcic plagioclase and bound water (in
unidentified phases) are dominant. A low (2–5%) frac-
tion of carbonate [Bandfield et al., 2003] or possibly
hydrous iron sulfate [Lane et al., 2004] has been identified
in this surface dust spectrum as well. Features consistent
with mafic minerals, such as pyroxene and olivine,
are lacking, although thermal infrared spectra of rocks
ground into fine particulates may contain up to 30% mafic
phases for which spectral features are not readily identified
[Hamilton, 2003]. Bandfield and Smith [2003] infer that
Martian surface dust is composed of both primary (e.g.,
plagioclase) and secondary (hydrous) minerals, with either
a significant mechanical weathering explaining the preva-
lence of feldspar over alteration minerals (favored), or
a physical mixture of chemically altered and unaltered
materials. The Fe3+-bearing minerals that are so prominent
in visible and near-infrared spectra are not detected in
thermal infrared spectra of the surface dust, probably
because they are present at low volumetric abundance
and may occur as surficial stains on mineral grains.
[4] The atmospheric dust presumably is related to the
surface dust and soils, representing the finest grained
materials in surface sedimentary deposits. Federova et al.
[2002] have reported an OH stretching band near 2.7 mm
in aerosol spectra, although aerosol spectra described by
Erard et al. [1994] and Kirkland et al. [1999] show no
evidence of 3 mm or 6 mm OH absorption features. In
thermal infrared measurements, the atmospheric transmis-
sion contributes to the spectral radiance as much or more
than the emission from surface materials. The composition
of lofted surface dust may be estimated by analysis of the
strong atmospheric transmission signature, which is domi-
nated by absorptions in the 1250–800 cm1 (8–12 mm)
region [e.g., Hanel et al., 1972a, 1972b; Conrath et al.,
1973; Hunt et al., 1973; Toon et al., 1977; Christensen et
al., 1998]. These features are consistent with the presence of
significant amounts of silicate materials, and studies using a
variety of data sets have identified qualitative similarities in
shape between the thermal infrared spectra of Martian
atmospheric dust and the transmission spectra of sheet
silicates [Hunt et al., 1973; Aronson and Emslie, 1975;
Toon et al., 1977], palagonite [Roush et al., 1991; Clancy et
al., 1995], olivine [Hugeunin, 1987], and feldspar [Aronson
and Emslie, 1975; Grassi and Formisano, 2000]. Small
concentrations of carbonate [Pollack et al., 1990; Lellouch
et al., 2000] also have been suggested as components of the
atmospheric dust from infrared data.
[5] We hope to place constraints on the composition of
the atmospheric dust via a two-step process. First, using
optical constants derived from MGS TES and M9 IRIS data
acquired during periods of high dust opacity, we synthesize
transmission and emission spectra of the Martian dust.
Second, we perform a linear deconvolution analysis of these
spectra to constrain the composition of the dust. The
combination of spectra derived from optical constants with
a quantitative analysis of the dust spectral shape yields an
analytical approach for determining the dust composition
that has not been applied to this problem previously.
2. Methods
[6] The radiance spectrum measured at an orbiting sensor
is a complicated combination of signatures that include not
only scattering from suspended aerosols, but also the
transmission and absorption of both the incident light and
light scattered by the surface, as well as light multiply
scattered between the surface and atmosphere, and can be
described by the following equation [Bandfield and Smith,
2003]:
Iobs vð Þ ¼ e vð ÞB Tsurf ; v
 
et0 vð Þ=m þ
Z t0
0
Bð T pð Þ; v½ et v;pð Þ=mdt:
ð1Þ
In this equation, Iobs(v) is the measured radiance, e(v) is the
emissivity of the surface, B[Tsurf, v] is the blackbody
radiance as a function of surface temperature, Tsurf, t(v, p) is
the normal opacity profile as a function of wave number and
pressure, and m is the cosine of the emission angle. The first
term accounts for emission from the surface and its
E12006 HAMILTON ET AL.: MINERALOGY OF MARTIAN ATMOSPHERIC DUST

E12006
subsequent absorption by the atmosphere. The second term
integral is taken through the atmosphere from the opacity at
the spacecraft (t = 0) to the surface (t = t0) and T(p) is the
atmospheric temperature profile. This term accounts for
radiation emitted by the atmosphere and suspended
aerosols. Solar and thermal radiation reflected from the
surface as well as secondary scattering are neglected in this
equation, and surface radiation is considered to be diffuse.
In addition, dust is assumed to be well mixed with the CO2-
rich atmosphere and not stratified at any level. Interpreting
the geologic components of the atmospheric dust requires
some means of separating and solving for the radiance due
only to the dust suspended in the atmosphere. One means of
accomplishing this separation is to view a given area on the
Martian surface at different angles, and thus through
different path lengths, as performed by Bandfield and Smith
[2003] using TES data. However, these authors were
interested in examining surface spectra derived from their
separation, and did not convert their atmospheric opacities
into effective infrared spectra. Another approach is to use
optical constants derived from the measured spectra [Snook,
1999, 2002; Hansen, 2003] to calculate the effective
transmission through (or emission from) the dust suspended
in the atmosphere. This approach makes it possible to study
the atmospheric dust spectrum in cases where multiple
emission angle data are not available, such as with IRIS
data.
[7] Snook [1999, 2002] inverted IRIS and TES infrared
data using an iterative radiative transfer approach that
solved for several parameters, including the spectral com-
plex refractive indices and opacity of the aerosol dust
(detailed description of the model is beyond the scope of
this paper, but can be found in the cited works). We used
Snook’s baseline optical constants (cases P1c and M2b, her
Tables 5.3 and 5.4) for our analysis of the Mariner 9 data
[Snook, 1999] and the values for TES data were obtained
from Snook [2002]. Independently, optical constants repre-
senting differing average surface and atmospheric temper-
ature conditions (cases 63g, 8a, and 9a) have been derived
from IRIS data by Hansen [2003] using a forward model,
and also are included in our study. The optical constants
need to be converted to infrared spectra so that they may be
compared to available spectral libraries. We did this in two
ways to obtain transmission and emission versions of the
dust spectrum. We converted the modeled Martian refractive
indices to equivalent transmittances (Figure 1a) using a
Maxwell-Garnett effective medium model, described in
detail by Hapke [1993]. This model uses the optical con-
stants of the Martian dust to calculate the spectral absorp-
tion coefficient and transmittance that would be observed if
we could analyze a KBr pellet containing Martian dust. We
also used the refractive indices to calculate the Fresnel
reflectivity and single scattering albedo of a large particle,
which was then inserted into a radiative transfer algorithm
[Hapke, 1996a, 1996b] to calculate the spectral emissivity
of an infinitely thick layer of 800 mm particles (Figure 1b).
In this case, the highest value of each spectrum was
assumed to correspond to the Christiansen feature and the
spectra were normalized to unity at that wavelength.
[8] The calculated transmission and emission spectra
were linearly deconvolved [e.g., Ramsey and Christensen,
1998] using transmission and emission spectra (respectively)
obtained from the spectral libraries of Salisbury et al. [1991]
and Christensen et al. [2000b]. The transmission end-
member set we used contained 30 minerals representing
a range of minerals commonly associated with mafic
igneous lithologies and their alteration products, including:
feldspars, olivines, pyroxenes, zeolites, phyllosilicates,
quartz, amphibole, goethite, gypsum, and calcite (Table 1).
Although the linear deconvolution approach has not been
utilized with transmission spectra (to our knowledge), linear
mixing in transmission spectra of geologic materials has
been demonstrated previously [e.g., Lyon et al., 1959;
Omori, 1967]. Deconvolutions of the transmission spectra
were limited to the 1275–830 cm1 (7.8–12 mm) region
to avoid spectral regions containing major atmospheric H2O

and CO2 absorptions, and because the lower wave number
optical constants are less reliable. The spectra from the
emission library included similar minerals (Table 2), most
representing samples with particle sizes from 710–1000 mm,
as well as end-members representing gaseous CO2, water
vapor, and Mars surface dust. The atmospheric dust emis-
sion spectra were deconvolved over the wave number range
of 1275–830 cm1 to avoid major atmospheric H2O and
CO2 absorptions as well as the lower wave number regions
where the optical constants are less reliable.
[9] All synthetic IRIS spectra were resampled from their
original 2 cm1 sampling to the nominal 10 cm1 spectral
sampling of TES so that all of the modeling results would
be directly comparable. Reducing the spectral resolution of
the IRIS data in this way effectively filters it; the resampling
reduces noise in the spectra, but it also will remove some
spectral information as well, with narrow atmospheric gas
features being the most strongly affected. Because we are
interested in atmospheric dust mineralogy, not gases, and
because most minerals do not have features narrower than
10–20 cm1, we believe that this resampling is not likely to
have a detrimental effect on our results. Further support
comes from Hamilton and Christensen [2000] and Hamilton
et al. [2001], who demonstrated that modeled mineral
abundances obtained from laboratory data having 10 cm1
sampling typically are within 5% of the abundances modeled
from data having 2 cm1 sampling. In these (and other)
laboratory studies of deconvolution accuracy (measured vs.
modeled abundance) at 2 cm1 sampling, 5% is among the
best accuracies observed, and we expect this value to be
worse for remotely sensed data, which exhibit greater noise,
include atmospheric components, and may be acquired at
lower spectral resolution. Generalized uncertainties and
detection limits associated with deconvolutions of the TES
data set, for example, are on the order of 10–15% [e.g.,
Bandfield et al., 2000]. Therefore, once all of these factors
are considered, we would expect any differences obtained
from modeling the IRIS data at higher spectral resolution to
be slight (5%), within the general uncertainties of the linear
deconvolution as applied commonly to remote sensing data,
and not necessarily representative of statistically significant
improvements in the absolute accuracy of phase or abun-
dance determinations. Lastly, the highly derived nature of
the spectra we interpret here, which are models of optical
constants, which themselves are derived from models of
remote sensing data, leads us to assume that the general
uncertainties in our study (for both IRIS and TES data) are
higher than for direct interpretation of TES spectral data.
3. Results
[10] Deconvolution model fits to the synthetic TES and
IRIS spectra are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The model fits to
the IRIS transmission spectra generally are mediocre to poor
(Figures 2b–2f) and indicate that the mineralogical infor-
mation derived from the fits is not valid. We do not report
the detailed deconvolution results of these samples,
although we discuss the reasons for their elimination below.
The model fit to the TES transmission spectrum (Figure 2a)
is good, with a modeled mineralogy dominated by
(70 vol.%) framework silicates, with gypsum, pyroxene,
and olivine identified at or below 20 vol.% (Table 3). The
model fits to the dust emission spectra (Figure 3) generally
are good. The modeled mineralogies of the emission spectra
typically are dominated (30–70%) by Martian surface dust

[Bandfield and Smith, 2003] and/or framework silicates
(plagioclase and zeolite, 10–60%), with phyllosilicates
and goethite at 5–25%, and several phases at or below
15% (Table 3).
[11] To evaluate the quality of deconvolution fits, we
compare the measured and modeled spectra by visual
inspection. The model spectra of the IRIS-derived dust
transmission spectra in Figures 2b–2f show significant
deviations from the measured spectra, either failing to
model accurately the measured features (e.g., features
around 900 cm1 in Figures 2b and 2d) or introducing
spectral features that are not present in the measured
spectrum (e.g., features at 1100 cm1 in Figures 2d–2f).
The spectral fits in Figures 2d–2f are the best of the IRIS
subset; however, the major misfit around 1100 cm1 is the
result of significant modeled abundances of quartz (15–
50%), which are inconsistent with the known mineralogy of
Mars, and the primary rationale for our not considering
these deconvolution results further. Although it is tempting
to compare the root mean square (RMS) errors from these
models to each other or to those of previous models of
Martian data, this is not a valid approach because the
wavelength regions over which the deconvolutions were
performed and the spectral contrasts of the spectra vary
significantly. These differences affect the calculation of the
RMS error value in such a way that makes it impossible to
directly compare the values.
[12] The generally poor fits to the IRIS transmission
spectra indicate a problem with either the end-member set
used in the deconvolution or the spectra themselves. If the
Martian spectra represent phases that are not included in the
end-member library, the deconvolution algorithm cannot
identify them and will utilize whatever available mineral
spectra achieve the best numerical fit. Alternatively, the
spectra may be flawed if the optical constants from which
they are derived are inaccurate. One example pointing
toward the latter case is the strong narrow spike in the IRIS
M2b spectra near 900 cm1, which is not characteristic of
silicate mineral spectra. This spike could not have been
introduced when we resampled the IRIS data to TES
resolution, because resampling does not introduce features
that are not already present, and would tend to have the
effect of smoothing any pre-existing features. Apparent
emissivity spectra (measured radiances converted to emis-
sion, without separation of surface and atmospheric signa-
tures) acquired by TES and IRIS during Martian dust storms
appear similar and we would expect that their optical
constants and effective dust transmission spectra should
appear similar as well. However, after optical constants
are derived from these data and converted to effective
transmission, dissimilarities (some resulting from differing
approaches to the derivation of the optical constants)
become apparent. Because the dust composition generally
is uniform, and the synthesized TES transmission spectrum
is modeled relatively well with the provided end-member
minerals, we believe that there may be greater inaccuracies
in the optical constants derived from IRIS spectra. The
calculations of Snook [1999] and Hansen [2003] necessarily
make several assumptions that affect the derived values of
the optical constants. For example, in the absence of
multiple emission angle observations, modeling of optical
constants from IRIS data relies on assumptions about the
particle size distribution that are derived from other esti-
mates in the literature [Snook, 1999; Hansen, 2003]. We
believe that uncertainties in this and other assumptions
confound the derivation of optical constants from the IRIS
data that are sufficiently accurate for the generation of
robust dust transmission spectra. The TES optical constants,
on the other hand, were derived using multiple emission
angle measurements [Snook, 2002] and our modeled trans-
mission spectrum appears more like the initial TES apparent
emissivity spectrum. This spectrum yields a generally
reasonable model fit and mineralogical result. The question
then is raised as to whether or not the IRIS-derived emission
spectra of the dust can be interpreted reliably if the optical
constants contain inaccuracies. Interestingly, the IRIS emis-
sion spectra are better modeled than the transmission
spectra. The mineral end-member sets used to deconvolve
the transmission and emission data were selected to be very
similar, so we doubt that the emission end-member set is
more complete. Also, the model results from the IRIS
emission spectra broadly are consistent with those of the
TES transmission and emission spectra, which suggests that
the IRIS emission spectra may be more reliable than the
IRIS transmission spectra. The most likely explanation for
the more reasonable fits to the synthesized IRIS emission
spectra lies in the difference between the propagation of
light transmitted through a sample versus the reflectivity of
the surface of a sample. The light transmitted by a pellet is
exponentially proportional to the imaginary part of the
refractive index, whereas the emissivity of a coarse powder
is determined by the reflectivity of the surface of a particle,
which is roughly proportional to [(n  1)2 + k2]/(n + 1)2 +
k2], where n and k are the real and imaginary components,
respectively, of the refractive index. Hence transmission
intrinsically is more sensitive to weaker spectral features

than emissivity, and errors in the optical constants will be
enhanced in our effective transmission spectra relative to
our effective emission spectra.
4. Discussion
[13] Our data support the idea that framework silicates,
such as feldspar, dominate the atmospheric dust. Interme-
diate plagioclase (An30–70) is the feldspar composition
used in the best fits to the TES and IRIS emission spectra
and the TES transmission spectrum. This compositional
range compares favorably to feldspar compositions for
global surface units calculated from TES spectral deconvo-
lutions (An54–69) [Hamilton et al., 2001] and for analyzed
plagioclase in Martian basaltic meteorites (An45 – 60)
[McSween and Treiman, 1998]. The similarity in our
deconvolved plagioclase composition with that of plausible
source rocks lends credibility to the conclusion that the dust
contains significant amounts of plagioclase. Differences in
modeled feldspar abundance between the transmission
(30%) and emission (15% on average) spectra is derived
largely from the inclusion of the TES-derived surface dust
spectrum as an end-member in the emission deconvolutions
and its use in the best fit for five out of six emission spectra.
As described above, this spectrum represents a fine partic-
ulate surface suggested to be dominated by features attrib-
utable to framework silicates [Bandfield and Smith, 2003],
and thus is consistent with a high total abundance of
framework silicate in the emission spectra and the high
total abundance derived from the transmission spectrum
(there is no surface dust transmission spectrum in that end-
member set).
[14] Because of their chemical and structural similarities,
the thermal infrared spectra of fine particulate zeolites and
feldspars are quite similar, and Ruff [2004] has suggested
that the Martian surface dust may contain zeolite. Zeolites,
like feldspars, are framework silicates and may be described
loosely as hydrated feldspars. Our model results (Table 3)
include both feldspar (all cases) and zeolite (four out of
seven cases). Because of possible spectral ambiguity at fine
particle sizes, Bandfield and Smith [2003] considered the
possibility of zeolites as a component of the surface dust,
but do not favor them because they have not been identified
in Martian meteorites and because of the global lack of
observed phyllosilicates and K-feldspar (minerals that com-
monly are present in the environments where zeolites form)
in recent, high resolution remote sensing data sets [e.g.,
Christensen et al., 2001a; Bibring et al., 2005].
[15] Sulfate (gypsum) is modeled at low abundances in
two cases, which is consistent with the presence of sulfur
measured in soils at the Viking (7.9 wt.% SO3) [Clark et al.,
1982], Mars Pathfinder (6.8 wt.% SO3) [Wa¨nke et al.,
2001], and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) [Gellert et al.,
2004; Rieder et al., 2004] sites. Sulfates in soils on Mars
have been predicted, based on thermodynamic stability
considerations [Clark and Van Hart, 1981; Catling, 1999]
and their occurrence as alteration products in Martian
meteorites [Gooding, 1992]. Epsomite, rather than gypsum,
has been suggested to be the dominant sulfate, based on a
strong correlation between measured Mg and S in soils
[Clark, 1993; Wa¨nke et al., 2001]. Gypsum, kieserite, and
one or more polyhydrated sulfates have been identified
tentatively on the Martian surface by the Mars Express
mission [Gendrin et al., 2005]. Gypsum and anhydrite occur
as secondary minerals in Martian meteorites [Bridges et al.,
2001] and the primary sulfate minerals identified in Terra
Meridiani include jarosite [Klingelho¨fer, 2004] and other
Ca-Mg sulfates [Christensen et al., 2004]. Our detection of
gypsum in dust is near to below general TES detection
limits and although we cannot say confidently that it is
present (it is not modeled in a majority of our spectra), it is
consistent with other observations and may represent a
sulfate phase in the atmospheric dust.
[16] Hydrated and hydroxylated phases (phyllosilicates
and goethite) are identified in several models. Phyllosili-
cates are identified above general detection limits at abun-
dances of 20–25% in three cases, and goethite is identified
at 15–20% in two cases. The highest abundances of both
phases all were identified in the emission spectra generated
from the Hansen optical constants. Although phyllosilicates
have been suggested previously as components of the
Martian dust (see above), and goethite has been tentatively
identified in various forms in Martian dust and rocks
[Moroz et al., 1990; Bell et al., 2000; Kirkland and Herr,
2000; Morris and Klingelho¨fer, 2005] or inferred from the
presence of other mineralogies [Glotch et al., 2004], our
relatively high modeled abundances are inconsistent with
orbital and in situ observations that should have little
difficulty identifying these phases if they are present in
the large quantities implied here [Bell, 1996; Bell et al.,
2000; Christensen et al., 2001a; Gellert et al., 2004; Bibring
et al., 2005; Yen et al., 2005]. Ambiguities in distinguishing
between the infrared spectra of coarse particulate zeolites,
glasses, and phyllosilicates have been proposed and/or
characterized [Bandfield et al., 2000; Wyatt and McSween,
2002; Ruff, 2004; Koeppen and Hamilton, 2005]. Therefore
we have low confidence that the phyllosilicate identifica-
tions are reliable and distinguishable from other phases,
particularly glasses, which were not included in our end-
member sets. There is greater support for goethite on Mars,
although we believe the relatively large abundances implied
in two models here are suspect.
[17] There are several phases for whose presence our data
do not or cannot show strong evidence. Only two of our
seven deconvolutions identified carbonates in the atmo-
spheric dust, and then only at 5–10%. However, this is
not necessarily unexpected as the strongest, broadest fun-
damental absorptions of carbonates are outside the wave-
length range included in our deconvolutions. For example,
the low (2–5%) abundance of carbonate identified in
surface dust by Bandfield et al. [2003] was identified using
the n3 fundamental feature (1525 cm1), which is empha-
sized by the volume scattering that occurs in the surface
dust. Our results generally do not show evidence for
abundant olivine or pyroxene in the atmospheric dust. This
result may indicate that the parent material contained low
abundances of these phases or that they have been weath-
ered away preferentially. We favor the former interpretation,
as independent observations from MER provide evidence
for olivine and pyroxene in the dust [Goetz et al., 2005].
Fundamental vibrational modes of Fe-oxides (such as he-
matite and magnetite) are located in the thermal infrared at
relatively low wave numbers (<650 cm1). Such features
resulting from the presence of crystalline hematite on the

Martian surface were identified from orbit using TES data
[Christensen et al., 2000a, 2001b; Glotch and Christensen,
2005] and have been investigated subsequently in the
Meridiani Planum region using the Miniature Thermal
Emission Spectrometer (MiniTES) [Christensen et al.,
2004] onboard the Opportunity rover. Magnetite is the
dominant magnetic phase in the airborne dust measured at
the MER landing sites, and is inferred to be a component of
virtually all dust particles (which seem to be composites)
[Goetz et al., 2005]. Despite these oxide identifications and
the strong evidence in visible and near infrared spectral data
for the presence of nanophase hematite (summarized by Bell
[1996]), because the optical constants at these longer wave-
lengths are less reliable and were not included in our
analysis, we are unable to infer the mineralogy or abun-
dance of oxides in our atmospheric dust spectra. However,
we note that thermal infrared apparent emissivity and
brightness temperature spectra of the Martian dust, which
typically are dominated by atmospheric transmission, do not
show strong oxide features at long wavelengths, suggesting
that the absolute volumetric abundances of such phases are
relatively low [e.g., Hunt et al., 1973; Toon et al., 1977;
Smith et al., 2000; Wolff and Clancy, 2003].
[18] Chemical analyses of Martian soils have been used to
derive the chemistry of the global dust [McSween and Keil,
2000]. The dust composition cannot be rationalized only as
mixtures of framework silicates with ferric oxides, so other
components (mafic minerals and/or poorly crystalline
phases) must be present. Because transmission spectra of
volcanic glass and palagonite were not included in our end-
member set, we cannot determine whether or not they might
further improve the model fits to the spectra (e.g., by
substituting for and reducing the modeled abundances of
zeolite).
5. Conclusions
[19] The dominant phases identified here in the atmo-
spheric dust are the framework silicates plagioclase feldspar
and zeolite. Lesser, but significant, amounts of phyllosili-
cates and goethite were identified in some of our models,
but we have low confidence in their identification (phyllo-
silicates) or abundance (goethite) because there is a lack of
strong supporting evidence from independent measure-
ments. Pyroxene, carbonate, sulfate, and olivine are identi-
fied, mostly at or below generalized detection limits.
However, there is evidence for these latter phases in other
data sets, and framework silicates alone cannot explain the
spectral or chemical properties of the dust. Other phases
must also be present, such as the oxides (hematite and
magnetite) that provide the dust with its color and magnetic
properties. Taking all of the visible, infrared, and in situ
observations into consideration, it seems plausible to suggest
that framework silicates (probably dominated by feldspar),
with lesser amounts of olivine, pyroxene, amorphous mate-
rial, hematite, and magnetite (the latter two possibly as
coatings), make up the atmospheric dust and that the dust
largely is the product of mechanical weathering of basaltic
rocks with minor chemical alteration. If there has not been
substantial aqueous alteration of the dust, as seems possible,
the higher abundances of plagioclase relative to mafic phases
also is consistent with the globally distributed, feldspar-rich
basaltic compositions observed from orbit and in situ [e.g.,
Bandfield et al., 2000; McSween et al., 2004].
[20] Our framework silicate-dominated mineralogy is
most consistent with the results of Aronson and Emslie
[1975] for the atmospheric dust and Bandfield and Smith
[2003] and Christensen et al. [2004] for the surface dust.
The latter two studies offer some reassurance that the TES
and MiniTES data sets are yielding consistent results re-
gardless of the analytical approach. This consistency also
provides support for the reliability of the optical constants
derived from TES data in particular, for which additional
constraints on measurement conditions can be acquired from
the data rather than assumed. Several enhancements to the
derivation of the TES optical constants will serve to improve
them even further [Snook, 2002]. Hopefully, models of dust
optical constants derived from past, current, and future
thermal infrared observations will continue to advance,
and future derivations of optical constants will permit
additional refinement of the composition of Mars’ globally
distributed dust.
