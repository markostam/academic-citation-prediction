Abstract
Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) converts the
superoxide anion into H2O2, which, unless it is detoxified by
glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), can increase hepatic iron
and can react with iron to form genotoxic compounds. We
investigated the role of Ala/Val-MnSOD and Pro/Leu-GPx1
polymorphisms on hepatic iron accumulation and hepatocel-
lular carcinoma development in patients with alcoholic
cirrhosis. Genotypes were determined in 162 alcoholic
patients with cirrhosis but without hepatocellular carcinoma
initially, who were prospectively followed up for hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma development. We found that patients with two
Val-MnSOD alleles (slow H2O2 production) and two Pro-GPx1
alleles (presumably quick H2O2 detoxification) had a lower
risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development than other
patients (C2 trend test, P = 0.001; log-rank, P = 0.0009).
Indeed, hepatocellular carcinoma percentage was 0% in
subjects with this ‘‘2Val-MnSOD/2Pro-GPx1’’ genotype versus
16%, 27%, and 32% in ‘‘2Val-MnSOD/1or2Leu-GPx1,’’ ‘‘1or2Ala-
MnSOD/2Pro-GPx1,’’ and ‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD/1or2Leu-GPx1’’
patients, respectively. The percentage of patients with
stainable hepatic iron increased progressively with these
genotypic associations: 22%, 28%, 50%, and 53%, respectively
(C2 trend test, P = 0.005). Stainable iron was a risk factor for
hepatocellular carcinoma (log-rank, P = 0.0002; relative risk,
3.40). In conclusion, polymorphisms in antioxidant enzymes
modulate hepatic iron accumulation and hepatocellular
carcinoma development in French alcoholic patients with
cirrhosis. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(5): 2844-52)
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth cause of cancer worldwide
and the third cause of cancer-related deaths (1). Its incidence is
rising in Western countries due to the recent hepatitis C epidemics
(1). However, alcohol abuse still remains the prevailing cause of
hepatocellular carcinoma in some countries, including France (1).
Alcohol intoxication increases reactive oxygen species (ROS)
formation in several cell compartments, including mitochondria
(2, 3), causing oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage (4, 5).
ROS and ROS-induced cytokines (6) lead to the apoptosis of some
hepatocytes (7–9) followed by inflammation, fibrogenesis (10), and
carcinogenesis (11).
Mitochondrial ROS are detoxified by the successive action of
manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione
peroxidase 1 (GPx1; ref. 12). MnSOD dismutates the superoxide
anion into H2O2, which GPx1 detoxifies into water (12).
GPx1 is the main glutathione peroxidase in the mammalian liver
(13, 14). It is encoded by nuclear DNA, with an internal, incomplete
mitochondrial targeting sequence, whose optional use targets GPx1
to either mitochondria or cytosol (13, 14). The active site of GPx1
contains a selenocysteine encoded by an UGA codon (15). Albeit
usually a stop codon, UGA encodes for selenocysteine in GPx1,
thanks to the formation of a quaternary structure involving the
ribosome, a stem-loop structure in the 3V-untranslated region of the
GPx1 mRNA, an RNA-binding protein, and selenocysteinyl-tRNASec
(15). Insufficient selenium concentrations impair GPx1 mRNA
stability, mRNA translation, and GPx1 activity (16). A genetic
polymorphism encodes for either proline (Pro) or leucine (Leu) at
codon 198 of human GPx1 (reference SNP cluster identifier
number: 1050450; refs. 17, 18). Although basal GPx1 activities were
similar in breast carcinoma cells transfected with either Leu-GPx1
or Pro-GPx1 variants, selenium at concentrations anticipated in the
human serum increased the activity of the Pro-GPx1 variant more
than the Leu-GPx1 variant (19). The less active Leu-GPx1 variant
was associated with lung (17), prostate (18), and breast (19) cancer.
Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity affecting GPx1 can occur in the
tumors of patients with breast cancer (19) or cancer of head and
neck (20).
MnSOD is encoded by nuclear DNA and is inducible by ROS,
cytokines, and ethanol (21–23). MnSOD is synthesized with a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, which drives its mitochondrial
import (24). In the matrix, the targeting sequence is cleaved, and
the mature protein assembles into the active tetramer (24).
A genetic polymorphism incorporates either alanine (Ala) or valine
(Val) in the targeting sequence of MnSOD (reference SNP cluster
identifier number: 1799725; ref. 24). The Ala-MnSOD variant, whose
presequence has an a-helix structure, is easily imported and
achieves high mitochondrial activity, whereas the Val-MnSOD
variant, whose presequence may have a partial h-sheet structure, is
partly stuck within the narrow inner membrane import pore (24),
and is partly degraded in the proteasome (25). Furthermore, its
mRNA is rapidly degraded, so that the Val-MnSOD variant only
achieves low activity (25).

We previously reported that French alcoholics with two Val-
MnSOD alleles were protected against the development of cirrhosis
(26) and then hepatocellular carcinoma and death (27) compared
with patients with one or two copies of the Ala-MnSOD–encoding
allele.
A limitation of these previous studies was that a possible
comodulatory role of the GPx1 polymorphism was not investigat-
ed, and the possible role of iron was not assessed (26, 27). Not
only MnSOD activity but also GPx1 activity could modulate the
intracellular levels of H2O2, which could itself modulate hepatic
iron accumulation and hepatocellular carcinoma development.
Indeed, hydrogen peroxide reacts with Fe2+ to form the hydroxyl
radical, which damages DNA (28). Furthermore, H2O2-mediated
signaling activates cytosolic iron-responsive protein 1 (IRP1),
which binds to an iron-responsive element in the promoter of
the transferrin receptor gene, to increase its transcription and
hepatic iron uptake (29, 30). Increased iron stores could then
further increase hydroxyl radical formation in the presence of
high H2O2 levels, thus further increasing DNA damage, and the
probability of cancer. Indeed, hepatic iron is an important
predictor of the risk of death in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis
(31), who can develop mild hepatic iron overload. More severe iron
overload can occur in hereditary hemochromatosis (31), which is
due to cysteine (Cys) to tyrosine (Tyr), or histidine (His) to
aspartate (Asp) mutations in the HFE gene (32, 33). About 80% of
hereditary hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the
Cys282Tyr HFE mutation (32, 33). Patients with both one Cys282Tyr
allele and one His63Asp allele may also occasionally develop iron
overload, although most have normal hepatic iron stores.
The major Cys282Tyr mutation prevents the formation of a
disulfide bond in the HFE protein, thus decreasing its association
with h2-microglobulin and its cell surface expression (34). This may
prevent the association of the HFE protein with the transferrin
receptor in duodenal crypt cells, which may trigger a compensa-
tory increase in iron absorption by villus cells (35).
In the present study, we looked for a combined role of the Ala/
Val-MnSOD and Pro/Leu-GPx1 genetic polymorphisms on hepatic
iron accumulation and hepatocellular carcinoma development in a
large series of French patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Results
suggest that patients with two low-activity MnSOD alleles and
two high-activity GPx1 alleles are protected from hepatocellular
carcinoma development. Patients with two low-activity MnSOD
alleles, but either none, or only one, high-activity GPx1 allele have
an intermediate risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, patients
with either one or two high-activity MnSOD allele(s) frequently
develop hepatic iron accumulation and have a high risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma, whatever their GPx1 status.
Patients and Methods
Patients. The present study was part of an ongoing prospective study, to
prospectively assess the rates of hepatocellular carcinoma development in
diverse liver diseases (27).
In the present study, we compiled all new patients who were
consecutively admitted between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 2001
and who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (a) biopsy-proven hepatic
cirrhosis; (b) daily alcohol intake of z80 g; (c) no other cause of liver
disease and no infection by the HIV, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B virus; (d) no
evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of inclusion, as judged by
negative ultrasonographic findings and serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) <50 ng/
mL; (e) residence in France and Caucasian origin; ( f ) availability of either a
frozen liver sample or a blood sample to prepare DNA; and (g ) acceptance
of a regular follow-up for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. A total
of 162 patients met all these inclusion criteria and had a known outcome as
of August 31, 2004.
For each patient, the date of inclusion was the date of the first liver
biopsy showing cirrhosis. Gender, age, previous daily alcohol intake,
presence of ascites or hepatic encephalopathy, serum bilirubin, albumin
and prothrombin levels, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity,
platelet count, blood iron, and ferritin levels were recorded at inclusion.
Patients were prospectively evaluated every 6 months by physical
examination, ultrasonography, and AFP measurements (27). When these
investigations suggested possible hepatocellular carcinoma, computed
tomodensitometry and/or magnetic resonance imaging and/or a guided
liver biopsy were done. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed on either
one of the following criteria: histologic evidence or convergent demon-
stration of a focal lesion >2 cm in size and with arterial hyper-
vascularization by two different imaging techniques, or the combination of
one imaging technique showing this morphologic aspect with an AFP level
of z400 ng/mL (27).
The two main end points of the study were the occurrence of
hepatocellular carcinoma and the occurrence of liver transplantation or
death. Follow-up ended at the date of death or liver transplantation, or at
the last recorded visit (or information) within the last 6 months before
August 31, 2004, which was set as the final time limit for upgrading the
patients’ file. Alcohol consumption was again recorded at end point.
DNA extraction, amplification, and MnSOD/GPx1/HFE genotyping.
DNA samples were prepared from blood or frozen liver samples. All patients
gave written consent for blood sampling and genotyping. The use of left
over liver specimens (no longer used for diagnostic purposes) for research
purposes had been approved by the Comite´ Consultatif d’E´thique Me´dicale
du Centre Hospitalier Bichat-Beaujon.
To determine the MnSOD genotype, DNA was amplif ied
with primers 5V-CAGCCCAGCCTGCGTAGACGG-3V and 5V-CTTG-
GCCAACGCCTCCTGGTACTT-3Vand genotyped by restriction analysis, as
described (26, 27). In each experiment, DNA samples from patients, together
with three previously sequenced DNA samples serving as quality controls
(one of each genotype), were concomitantly amplified and digested with
BsaWI (New England Biolabs, Ozyme, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France;
refs. 26, 27). This restriction enzyme only cleaves the MnSOD amplification
product, when a thymine is present at position 1183 of the MnSOD gene
(i.e., in the valine-encoding allele), thus giving a 183-bp fragment and an 84-
bp fragment. Lack of digestion, half digestion, or complete digestion was
detected after migration on 3% agarose gel (2% Nusieve, 1% Seakem; Tebu,
Le-Perray-en-Yvelines, France), allowing clear distinction of Ala/Ala, Ala/Val,
and Val/Val patients (26, 27).
To determine the GPx1 genotype, DNA was amplified with primers 5V-
TGTGCCCCTACGCAGGTACA-3V and 5V-CCCCCGAGACAGCAGCA-3V (17).
In each experiment, DNA samples from the patients, together with three
previously sequenced DNA samples serving as quality controls (one of each
genotype), were concomitantly amplified and digested with ApaI (Invi-
trogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France). This restriction enzyme only cleaves the
GPx1 amplification product, when a cytosine is present at position 593 of
the GPx1 gene (i.e., in the proline-encoding allele), thus giving an 81-bp
fragment and a 66-bp fragment. Lack of digestion, half digestion, or
complete digestion was detected after migration on 4% agarose gel (4%
Nusieve), allowing clear distinction of Leu/Leu, Pro/Leu, and Pro/Pro
patients.
The quality control samples included in the determination of
the MnSOD (n = 15) or GPx1 genotype (n = 15) always gave the same
genotypes in successive RFLP experiments as in sequencing experiments.
Finally, to look for the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutations of the HFE
gene, the DNA of each patient was amplified in real-time PCR with a Fast
Light Cycler kit accordingly with the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche,
Meylan, France; ref. 36).
Histologic assessment of hepatic iron. Hepatic iron was assessed on
the initial liver biopsy showing cirrhosis. Liver specimens were fixed in
Bouin’s fluid and routinely processed. Hepatic sections (4-Am thick) were

stained with the Perls’ stain and examined by two observers unaware of
genotypic and clinical data. To semiquantitatively evaluate hepatic iron
deposits, we used the Deugnier’s histologic hepatic iron score (37), adapted
to cirrhotic samples (31).
Statistical analysis. Qualitative variables were compared using the
Fischer exact m2 test or m2 trend test with 1 degree of freedom, whereas
quantitative variables were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon
test. Multivariate analysis (ANOVA) was also conducted to compare more
than two means. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate death and
the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma for each variable noted at
enrollment, and the distribution of death and hepatocellular carcinoma
were compared with the log-rank test (38). A significant level below 0.10 was
used to select the variables in the Cox’s proportional hazards model (39),
using a stepwise backward procedure with a threshold of a = 0.05. Variables
(iron score, age, and sex) associated with risks of death or hepatocellular
carcinoma based on knowledge and findings from previous studies were
also selected. Statistical analysis used the SAS System Package version 8.02
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All reported Ps are two tailed. Associations were
first considered statistically significant at a two-tailed a = 0.05. Bonferroni
adjustment was also applied to correct for the number of primary outcomes
tested (i.e., for 10 primary outcomes, a = 0.005).
Results
Characteristics of patients classified according to the Ala/
Val-MnSOD genotype, the Pro/Leu-GPx1 genotype, or com-
bined MnSOD/GPx1 genotypes. The MnSOD and GPx1 genotypic
distributions in these patients did not differ from the Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium expectations. Table 1 displays the initial
presentation and the final outcome in 162 patients with alcoholic
cirrhosis classified according to the MnSOD genotypes. Except for
a lower prevalence of stainable hepatic iron in patients with two Val
MnSOD alleles, the initial presentation and the persistence of
alcohol consumption at end point did not differ among the three
MnSOD genotypes (Table 1). However, as previously reported (27),
hepatocellular carcinoma and death occurred less frequently in
patients with two copies of the Val-MnSOD allele (Table 1). In
patients with at least one Ala-MnSOD allele (compared with
patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles), the hazard ratio (HR) of
hepatocellular carcinoma development was 11.494, and the
confidence interval (95% CI) was 2.659 to 50.000 (P = 0.001). The
HR for death in patients with at least one Ala-MnSOD allele was
11.235, and the 95% CI was 2.710 to 47.619 (P = 0.0009). Table 2
displays the same entries in patients classified according to
the GPx1 genotypes. Except for a higher plasma ferritin level in
patients with two Pro-GPx1 alleles, the clinical presentation and
outcome did not differ with the GPx1 genotypes. Because there were
only 10 patients with two Leu-GPx1 alleles, and because the
mortality rate and the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma
at end point were similar in patients with either one or two Leu-
GPx1 alleles (Table 2), these two GPx1 genotypes were combined
into a single group for the combined MnSOD/GPx1 genotypic
classification.
In keeping with the putative role of hydrogen peroxide in
hepatocellular carcinoma development as suggested by our previous
study (27), we finally classified the 162 patients into four groups
according to their combined MnSOD and GPx1 genotypes (Table 3).
The first group comprises patients with two alleles for the low-

activity Val-MnSOD variant (25) and two alleles for the Pro-GPx1
variant, which is associated with high GPx1 activity in the presence
of physiologic concentrations of selenium (19). These ‘‘2Val-MnSOD/
2Pro-GPx1’’ subjects may slowly form H2O2 and quickly detoxify it
and should therefore have low intracellular H2O2 concentrations.
In contrast, patients with one or two copies of the high-activity
Ala-MnSOD-encoding allele were combined into a single subgroup
(the ‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD’’ subgroup), because these patients had
similarly high incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma and death
(27). Likewise, patients with either the Leu/Leu-GPx1 genotype or
the Leu/Pro-GPx1 genotype were combined into a single subgroup
called the ‘‘1or2Leu-GPx1’’ subgroup, because the Leu-GPx1 allele
was a risk factor for lung (17), prostate (18), and breast (19) cancer,
and because mortality rates and hepatocellular carcinoma frequen-
cies were similar in these two groups (Table 2). Thus, patients were
divided among group 1 (‘‘2Val-MnSOD/2Pro-GPx1’’ patients), group 2
(‘‘2Val-MnSOD/1or2Leu-GPx1’’ patients), group 3 (‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD/
2Pro-GPx1’’ patients), and group 4 (‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD/1or2Leu-GPx1’’
patients). As discussed further on, patients may have increasing
intracellular H2O2 levels from group 1 to group 4.
Demographic, biological, and clinical features at inclusion did
not differ among the four genotypic groups (Table 3). Age, gender,
daily alcohol intake at inclusion, and serum ALT and platelet
count were similar (Table 3). Encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubin
level, albuminemia, prothrombin time, and the Child Pugh’s score
did not differ in the four genotypic groups (Table 3). The prevalence
of persisting alcohol consumption at end point also did not differ
between groups (Table 3).
Mean time of follow-up was 66 months for the whole cohort.
MnSOD/GPx1 Polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcino-
ma percentage. During follow-up, 40 of 162 (24.6%) patients
developed hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of hepatocel-
lular carcinoma increased with the genotypic group (Table 3). This
incidence was 0% (0 of 22) in group 1 (‘‘2Val-MnSOD/2Pro-GPx1’’
patients), 16.6% (3 of 18) in group 2 (‘‘2Val-MnSOD/1or2Leu-GPx1’’
patients), 27.5% (16 of 58) in group 3 (‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD/2Pro-GPx1’’
patients), and 32.8% (21 of 64) in group 4 (‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD/
1or2Leu-GPx1’’ patients; m2 trend test, P = 0.001).
Using the Kaplan-Meier method (Fig. 1), the ‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD’’
genotypes and ‘‘1or2Leu-GPx1’’ genotypes were associated with a
higher cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma com-
pared with patients in group 1 who did not develop hepa-
tocellular carcinoma. In the three groups of patients who
developed hepatocellular carcinoma, first quartiles up to hepa-
tocellular carcinoma occurrence were 180 months in group 2,
60 months in group 3, and 57 months in group 4 (log-rank test,
P = 0.0009).
In multivariate analysis according to the Cox model, old age
(P < 0.0001), male gender (P = 0.01), and group 4 of combined
MnSOD/GPx1 genotypes (Table 3) were independent risk factors
for hepatocellular carcinoma. Indeed, the HR for hepatocellular
carcinoma was 2.0 in group 4 compared with patients of the three
other groups, and the 95% CI was 1.311 to 3.052 (P = 0.001).
MnSOD/GPx1 polymorphisms and death/transplantation.
During follow-up, 49 of 162 (30.2%) patients died, all of them

were independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence. The HR for hepatocellular carcinoma was 2.0 in ‘‘1or2Ala-MnSOD/1or2Leu-GPx1’’ patients
compared with patients of the three other groups, and the 95% CI (CI ) was 1.311 to 3.052 (P = 0.001).

polymorphism associations were the only independent risk factor
for death/transplantation in this cohort (HR, 1.808 in group 4
patients compared with other groups; 95% CI, 1.271-2.573;
P = 0.0006).
MnSOD/GPx1 polymorphisms and liver iron accumulation.
Of the 162 patients, 73 (45%) had stainable liver iron. The
proportion of patients with stainable iron differed with the MnSOD
genotype (Table 1), with no influence of the GPx1 genotype (Tables
2 and 3). Whereas this proportion was 22% (5 of 22) and 28%
(5 of 18) in groups 1 and 2, it was 50% (29 of 58) and 53% (34 of 64)
in groups 3 and 4 (m2 trend test, P = 0.005).
In patients with stainable liver iron, the mean iron score
increased mainly according to the MnSOD genotype. This score
was 1.22 F 2.50 in group 1 (median, 0; 25th percentile, 0; 75th
percentile, 1), 0.66 F 1.23 in group 2 (median, 0; 25th percentile, 0;
75th percentile, 1), 1.98 F 2.81 in group 3 (median, 0.5; 25th
percentile, 0; 75th percentile, 3), and 2.84F 3.45 in group 4 (median,
2; 25th percentile, 0; 75th percentile, 5; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.003).
In multivariate analysis, old age (P = 0.002), male gender
(P = 0.003), and group 4 of the combined MnSOD/GPx1 genotypes
(P = 0.01) were independent risk factors for hepatic iron
accumulation according to ANOVA.
Liver iron accumulation and risk of hepatocellular carci-
noma. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was higher in
patients with stainable liver iron than in those without iron.
Indeed, 40% (29 of 73) of patients with stainable iron developed
hepatocellular carcinoma versus only 11% (10 of 89) of patients
without stainable iron (m2 test, P = 0.001). Stainable hepatic iron
was a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (log-rank test,
P = 0.0002). In patients who developed hepatocellular carcinoma,
first quartiles were 54 months in patients with stainable iron versus
180 months in patients without iron. The relative risk of developing
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with stainable liver iron was
3.40 (95% CI, 1.70-6.81; Fig. 3).
When hepatic iron overload was considered as a continuous
variable, the relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma per unit of
hepatic iron score was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.13-1.34; P < 0.0001). However,
stepwise backward multivariate analysis showed that the hepatic
iron score was not an independent risk factor for hepatocellular
carcinoma occurrence, possibly due to its dependence on age, sex,
and the combined MnSOD/GPx1 genotypes. In patients without
stainable hepatic iron, Cox model, including age, sex, and
genotypes, selected only age as a risk factor for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HR, 1.094; 95% CI, 1.022-1.171; P = 0.010), whereas
genotype associations were not significantly associated with
hepatocellular carcinoma risk (HR, 1.723; 95% CI, 0.856-3.469;
P = 0.128). In patients with stainable hepatic iron, Cox model,
including age, sex, and genotypes, selected both age (HR, 1.058; 95%
CI, 1.013-1.105; P = 0.011) and genotype associations (HR, 1.889;
95% CI, 1.086-3.284; P = 0.024) as risk factors for hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Influence of MnSOD/GPx1 polymorphisms on death and
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients without stainable liver
iron. We also studied the influence of MnSOD/GPx1 poly-
morphisms on death and hepatocellular carcinoma in the
subgroup of 89 patients without stainable liver iron. In this
subgroup, the MnSOD polymorphism was still a risk factor for
death/transplantation, which occurred in 0% (0 of 17) of patients
in group 1 and 0% (0 of 13) of patients in group 2, but 41.3% (12 of
29) of patients in group 3, and 33.3% (10 of 30) of patients in
group 4 (P = 0.0001).
In this subgroup of 89 patients without stainable hepatic iron,
the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was 0% (0 of 17) in
group 1, 15.3% (2 of 13) in group 2, 13.7% (4 of 29) in group 3, and
16.6% (5 of 30) in group 4. However, these differences did not reach
statistical significance (P = 0.2) in this small subgroup of patients
with a low overall rate of hepatocellular carcinoma development.
Lack of influence of HFE gene mutations on hepatic iron,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. None of the 162 patients
was homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation. Two patients were
compound (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp) heterozygotes, and three
were homozygous for the His63Asp mutation. Ten patients had a
heterozygous Cys282Tyr mutation, and 36 patients had a heterozy-
gous His63Asp mutation.
In this cohort, carrying or not the Cys282Tyr mutation and
carrying or not the His63Asp mutation did not significantly
influence the percentage of patients with stainable iron (50% versus
44.3%, P = 0.7; 47.2% versus 43.3%, P = 0.4, respectively), the
incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (40% versus 20.4%, P = 0.1;
33.3% versus 24.2%, P = 0.2), and the incidence of death or
transplantation (10% versus 30.9%, P = 0.1; 40.4% versus 31.2%,
P = 0.3).
Discussion
Previous studies have shown that French alcoholic patients
with one or two copies of the high activity Ala-MnSOD allele
have a higher risk of developing cirrhosis than patients with two
copies of the low activity Val-MnSOD allele (26, 27). At the time
of the first liver biopsy showing cirrhosis, the percentage of
alcoholic cirrhotic patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles (16%)
was less than in a control population (31%; ref. 27). However, the

mortality rate was lower in patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles
than in other patients (27). As the time of follow-up increased,
the proportion of surviving patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles
increased (27). This may explain why the genotypic repartition of
alcoholic patients differed from control subjects when patients
were studied at the time of the first liver biopsy showing
cirrhosis (26, 27), but not when blood samples were drawn at
various times after diagnosis (40, 41). In the present study, only
patients with a documented HFE genotype were included.
Because the HFE genotype was mostly determined on blood
samples drawn at various times after the first diagnosis of
cirrhosis, rather than from the initial liver tissue, this resulted in
a relative enrichment in patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles,
who represented 25% of patients in the present study compared
with 16% in our previous study (27).
Our previous study had also shown that patients with at least
one Ala-MnSOD allele have a higher risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma development than patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles
(27). The present study extends these data by showing that
patients with the Ala-MnSOD allele have more hepatic iron
accumulation, which may contribute to their increased risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma. This study also shows that the
hepatocellular carcinoma risk is further modulated by the Pro/
Leu-GPx1 genetic polymorphism in patients with two copies of the
low-activity Val-MnSOD allele (Table 3).
In a previous study, transfection of an Ala-MnSOD–encoding
vector led to a 4-fold higher MnSOD activity than the Val-MnSOD–
encoding vector (25). Thus, subjects having one or two copies of the
Ala-MnSOD allele may have a high basal MnSOD activity, which
may be further increased by alcohol abuse, because MnSOD is
inducible by ROS, cytokines, and ethanol (21–23). Conversely, the
activity of GPx1 may be decreased in alcoholics: first, by the
ethanol-induced decrease in mitochondrial glutathione (42) and
second, by ROS-mediated GPx1 inactivation (43). Therefore,
patients with one or two copies of the Ala-MnSOD allele may have
a major imbalance between a high formation rate of H2O2 by
MnSOD and a low detoxification rate of H2O2 by GPx1 (26, 27).
These patients may have high intracellular H2O2 concentrations,
whatever the more or less active GPx1 variant(s) present in these
subjects. Although the influence of hydrogen peroxide on iron
metabolism has been poorly evaluated in humans, several in vitro
studies have highlighted this regulation. High H2O2 concentrations
may have three consequences (Fig. 4, groups 3 and 4). First,
H2O2-induced signaling activates cytosolic IRP1, which binds to an
iron-responsive element in the promoter of the transferrin receptor
gene, to increase the transcription of this receptor and hepatocel-
lular iron uptake (29, 30). Indeed, the expression of the transferrin
receptor and hepatic iron stores are increased in patients with
alcoholic liver disease (44). Although hepatic iron is mainly
deposited as ferric iron, the metabolism of ethanol increases the
NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ ratios, thus partly reducing ferric
iron into ferrous iron (3). A second consequence of high H2O2
concentrations, particularly in the presence of ferrous iron, is to
form the hydroxyl radical, which damages DNA directly, and also
indirectly, by forming reactive, lipid peroxidation products (28). A
last consequence of high H2O2 levels and H2O2-induced cytokine
expression is to trigger mitochondrial permeability transition and
cell death in some hepatocytes (6–9). This apoptotic rate (8, 9)
must be compensated by an adaptive increase in progenitor cell
proliferation, to maintain liver cell mass (45). The combination
of DNA lesions and increased cell proliferation may cause gene
mutations (45). As somatic mutations accumulate over the years,
and as there is a constant apoptotic pressure, cells may be selected
that resist apoptosis and/or escape the control of the cell cycle, to
finally develop a malignant clone (45).
Whereas patients with either one or two Ala-MnSOD alleles had
iron overload and a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma,
whatever their GPx1 genotypes (Fig. 4, groups 3 and 4), in contrast,
patients with two copies of the low activity-associated Val-MnSOD
allele exhibited either a low, or an intermediate, hepatocellular
carcinoma risk, depending on their GPx1 genotype (Table 3). In
patients with two copies of the Pro-GPx1 allele, no hepatocellular
carcinoma occurred. In a previous study, transfection of a Pro-
GPx1–encoding vector in cells exposed to selenium resulted in a
higher GPx1 activity than with the Leu-GPx1 vector (19). Thus,
patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles and two Pro-GPx1 alleles may
slowly form H2O2 and quickly detoxify it and may have very low
intracellular concentrations of H2O2. These low levels may avoid
hydroxyl radical formation, DNA damage, and hepatocellular
carcinoma development (Fig. 4, group 1).
In contrast, patients with two Val-MnSOD alleles but one or two
copies of the low activity–associated Leu-GPx1 allele (group 2) had
an intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma risk (Table 3). Although
these patients may slowly form H2O2, they may also slowly detoxify
it. Accordingly, they could have an intermediate concentration
of H2O2, resulting in moderate hydroxyl radical formation, and
an intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma risk (Fig. 4, group 2).
Although low H2O2 concentrations do not trigger cell death and

was 3.40 [95% CI (CI), 1.70-6.81].

thus will not trigger compensatory cell proliferation, they may
directly increase cell proliferation (46), which might contribute to
the higher hepatocellular carcinoma risk in group 2 compared with
group 1 patients (Fig. 4).
Although iron has been previously identified as a risk factor for
death in cirrhotic patients (31), the role of hepatic iron
accumulation in hepatocarcinogenesis is difficult to assess, as
iron overload is dependent on male gender (no menstruation)
and age (progressive accumulation), which are by themselves the
most determinant risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma
development. Our study indicates that not only old age and male
gender but also group 4 of the combined MnSOD/GPx1 genotypes
are independent risk factors for hepatic iron accumulation
(histologic score) according to multiple regression analysis. As
discussed above, patients of group 4 may have high intracellular
H2O2 concentrations, which may induce the transferrin receptor
and increase hepatic iron uptake (Fig. 4). However, there was no
relationship between histologic iron accumulation, which tended
to increase from genotypic groups 1 and 2 to genotypic groups 3
and 4, and ferritinemia, which was not significantly different in
the four genotypic groups (Table 3). Further studies are needed to
better understand how ferritinemia may be regulated under
conditions associating both increased cell iron, which would tend
to increase ferritin synthesis, and H2O2-mediated activation of
cytosolic IRP1, which would tend to decrease ferritin synthesis.
It is difficult to discriminate the respective role of cellular iron
accumulation versus a direct effect of anti-oxidant enzymes on
hepatocellular carcinoma development. Stepwise backward multi-
variate analysis showed that the hepatic iron score was not an
independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence,
possibly due to its strong dependence on old age, male sex, and
the MnSOD/GPx1 genotype. However, although hepatic iron
is dependent on other factors, it may still play an important
pathogenic role in hepatocellular carcinoma development by
increasing the formation of the DNA-damaging hydroxyl radical
from H2O2 (Fig. 4). Indeed, the incidence of hepatocellular
carcinoma was higher in patients with stainable liver iron (40%)
than those without iron (11%), and the relative risk of developing
hepatocellular carcinoma was 3.40 (95% CI, 1.70-6.81) in patients
with stainable iron compared with patients without iron (Fig. 3).
Nevertheless, a few patients without stainable iron still developed
hepatocellular carcinoma. Taken together, these observations may
suggest that the antioxidant genotypes may modulate hepatocel-
lular carcinoma development both by modulating hepatic iron
stores and also by directly modulating the formation of the
hydroxyl radical as a direct consequence of changes in intracellular
H2O2 concentrations (Fig. 4).
Because our findings could help predict the risk of hepatocel-
lular carcinoma, which might modulate hepatocellular carcinoma
screening programs, it will be important to repeat this study in
large groups of patients in France and other countries. Although
dietary antioxidant intake may modulate oxidative stress and the
effects of antioxidant genotypes (47), this information was not
available in the present cohort. In future studies, it will be useful to
record information on diet, calorie intake, antioxidant intake, the
type of alcohol beverages (wine, beer, or spirits), and the drinking
pattern (steady drinking versus binges; ref. 27). Patients should be
included at the time of first diagnosis, and blood samples for
genotyping should be obtained at that time, before a prospective
follow-up (27).
In summary, we suggest that genetic polymorphisms affecting
MnSOD and GPx1 may modulate the risk of hepatic iron
accumulation and hepatocellular carcinoma development in
French alcoholic patients with cirrhosis. If confirmed by other
studies, these findings could improve the assessment of
hepatocellular carcinoma risk and clinical management in these
patients.

Figure 4. Dimorphisms in antioxidant
enzyme could modulate intracellular
hydrogen peroxide levels, hepatic iron, DNA
damage, and cellular turnover. Intracellular
concentrations of H2O2 may be low,
intermediate, and high, in patients of group
1, group 2, and combined groups 3 and 4,
respectively. In the latter patients, high H2O2
concentrations may activate cytosolic
IRP1 to induce the synthesis of the
transferrin receptor (TfR ) and increase the
hepatocellular uptake of iron. Particularly
in the presence of Fe2+, H2O2 generates
the hydroxyl radical, which damages
DNA. Finally, high H2O2 concentrations
may trigger hepatocyte cell death, which
secondarily triggers a compensatory
increase in progenitor cell proliferation, to
maintain liver mass. The combination of
DNA lesions and increased cell proliferation
may cause somatic mutations and cancer.
These effects may be absent in group 1
patients and might be either absent
(increased cell death) or moderate
(increased OH formation) in group 2
patients. HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.
