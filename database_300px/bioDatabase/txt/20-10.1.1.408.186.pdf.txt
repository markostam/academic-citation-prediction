[1] Ambient noise tomography and multiple plane wave earthquake tomography are new
methods of surface wave analysis that yield much more highly refined information about
the crust and uppermost mantle than traditional surface wave techniques. Applied together
to data observed at more than 300 broadband seismic stations from the Transportable
Array component of the EarthScope USArray, these methods yield surface wave
dispersion curves from 8 to 100 s period across the entire western United States with
unprecedented resolution. We use the local Rayleigh wave phase speed curves to construct
a unified isotropic 3-D Vs model to a depth of about 150 km. Crustal and uppermost
mantle features that underlie the western United States are revealed in striking relief. As
the USArray continues to sweep eastward across the United States, the substructure of the
entire country will be unveiled.

1. Introduction
[2] The western United States is undergoing broad and
diverse deformation caused by strike-slip motion (California
plate margin), subduction (Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates
beneath the Pacific northwest), extension (Basin and Range
province), and large-scale uplift (Colorado Plateau) as well
as small-scale lithospheric instabilities (southern Sierra
Nevada and Transverse ranges) and a hypothesized conti-
nental mantle ‘‘plume’’ (Snake River Plain and Yellow-
stone). These active tectonic processes are manifest in a
variety of crustal and lithospheric structures that have been
the subject of intense seismological study using portable
seismic instrumentation on a small scale [e.g., Humphreys
and Hager, 1990; Boyd et al., 2004; Zandt et al., 2004;
Waite et al., 2006; Xue and Allen, 2007] as well as
observatory class instrumentation on a continental scale
[e.g., van der Lee and Nolet, 1997; Grand, 1994]. Tradi-
tional P wave tomography has provided the first tantalizing
glimpses at these structures [e.g., Dueker et al., 2001;
Burdick et al., 2008; Pollitz, 2008] in the mantle and a
3-D model has been constructed from ambient noise to-
mography across the entire United States (G. D. Bensen et
al., A 3-D velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle
beneath the United States from ambient seismic noise,
submitted to Geophysical Journal International, 2008),
yet no integrated 3-D seismological model of the crust
and uppermost mantle exists across the western United
States on the spatial scale of these features. Such a model
is needed to identify the principal structural features across
the western United States, determine the relations between
the features themselves and their surface expressions, and
provide clues about their nature and origin.
[3] Recent improvements in seismic instrumentation in
the western United States coupled with advancements in
seismic methodology now allow for the development of
such a 3-D seismic model of the crust and uppermost mantle
beneath the western United States. The EarthScope/
USArray Transportable Array (TA), presently being
deployed across the western United States on a nearly
uniform 70-km grid, provides the requisite broadband
seismic data (Figure 1a). The technical innovations in
surface wave tomography include ambient noise tomogra-
phy [e.g., Shapiro et al., 2005; Sabra et al., 2005] and a
recent innovation in earthquake tomography that we call
teleseismic multiplane wave tomography (MPWT). MPWT
is a large-scale generalization of the commonly used two-
plane wave method of Yang and Forsyth [2006a, 2006b]
and is applied for the first time here. We use these methods
together to produce broadband surface wave dispersion
measurements from 8 to 100 s period that are then inter-
preted in terms of 3-D shear velocity variations in the crust
and uppermost mantle across more than 1.2  106 km2 of
the western United States.

group and phase speed curves and the resulting dispersion
maps [e.g., Yao et al., 2006; Bensen et al., 2007; Yang et al.,
2007; Lin et al., 2007; Cho et al., 2007]. The method has
been applied across the western United States to data from
the USArray/TA (Figure 1a) for time series up to 3 years in
length to produce phase speed [Lin et al., 2008a] and group
speed maps [Moschetti et al., 2007] from 6 to 40 s period.
The principal advantage of ambient noise tomography is
that surface wave dispersion at short periods (<20 s), which
is difficult to measure using teleseismic earthquake methods
due to intrinsic attenuation and scattering from distant
sources, can be obtained robustly to provide unique con-
straints on crustal structure.
[5] Information about the mantle is contained in the
longer period measurements (>40 s) obtained from tele-
seismic earthquakes, but scattering and multipathing caused
by lateral heterogeneities between the earthquakes and the
TA stations distort incoming waves, leading to wavefield
complexity. To address this problem, each incoming tele-
seismic wavefield is fit with a multiple plane wave expan-
sion where each plane wave has an initially unknown
amplitude, phase, and propagation direction. Because the
size of the region of study is near the limit of the two-plane
wave assumption in both Cartesian and spherical coordi-
nates, we divide the western United States into three
subregions from north to south and simultaneously model
the incoming wavefield in each of the three subregions
using two plane waves. Six plane waves, therefore, are
employed to model each incoming wavefield across the
western United States. This method is an extension of that
used by Yang and Ritzwoller [2008], which models each
incoming wavefield using two plane waves and inverts for
phase velocities separately in each of subregions. In this
study, we interpret the observed phase and amplitude
observed across the USArray/TA jointly to model the
incoming wavefields and invert for the phase velocity

including the Cascade Range (CR), the Mendocino transform fault (MT), the Columbia River Flood
Basalts (CRFB), the Yakima Fold Belt (YFB), the Rocky Mountains (RM), the High Lava Plains (HLP),
the Snake River Plain (SRP), the Great Valley (GV), the Sierra Nevada Range (SN), the Basin and Range
province (BR), the Transverse Range (TR), the Peninsular Range (PR), and the Salton Trough (ST).

variation simultaneously across the array. The 2-D sensitiv-
ity kernels based on the Born approximation [Zhou et al.,
2004] are employed to represent the sensitivity of the
incoming wavefields to the phase velocity variation across
the array. Sixty teleseismic earthquakes are used with Ms >
5.5 and epicentral distances from 30 to 120 from the
center of the array that occurred in the 21-month period
from January 2006 through September 2007.
[6] Ambient noise tomography and teleseismic multiple-
plane wave tomography provide structural information in
complementary period bands: ambient noise from 6 to 40 s
and the teleseismic method from 25 to 100 s. The methods
have similar resolution at short and intermediate periods
(<40 s), estimated to approach the interstation spacing
(70 km) at short periods (Figure 2). In ambient noise
tomography, we estimate resolution using the method de-
scribed by Barmin et al. [2001] with modifications pre-
sented by Levshin et al. [2005]. The resolution at a spatial
node is defined by a resolution surface, which is a row of
the resolution matrix from tomography. To summarize this
information, we fit a 2-D symmetric spatial Gaussian
function to the surface at each node. Resolution is then
defined as twice the standard deviation of the Gaussian fit at
each node and this information can be plotted as a resolu-
tion map. Examples of resolution maps at 12 and 33 s
period are presented in Figure 2. In the multiple-plane wave
tomography, we do not estimate resolution directly. We infer
it indirectly based on the similarity of phase speed maps
from these two methods (e.g., Figure 3f).
[7] In ambient noise tomography (ANT), uncertainties in
the dispersion measurements are determined by repeating
the measurements over disjoint time intervals [e.g., Bensen
et al., 2007]. Uncertainties at different nodes in the disper-
sion maps, however, are estimated using a new method of
tomography called Eikonal tomography [Lin et al., 2008b].
This method involves wavefield phase time tracking and the
production of a phase travel time map centered on each
station. Each station-centered phase-time map is interpreted
separately with the Eikonal equation [e.g., Kravtsov and
Orlov, 1990] to estimate local phase speed from the mod-
ulus of the local gradient of the phase-time map. Rayleigh
wave uncertainties are estimated at a given location from the
multiplicity of phase-time maps centered on different sta-
tions. Uncertainties average 5–10 m/s near the center of the
study region but increase near its periphery. In multiple-
plane wave tomography, standard errors are taken from the
model covariance matrix [Yang and Forsyth, 2006a] and
average between 10 and 15 m/s near the center of the region
but grow near the edges.
Figure 2. Resolution maps from ambient noise tomography for Rayleigh wave phase speed at periods
of (a) 12 and (b) 33 s. Resolution is defined as twice the standard deviation of a 2-D Gaussian function fit
to the resolution matrix at each point [Levshin et al., 2005]. The 70 km resolution contour is shown with a
thick black line. Resolution at other periods is similar.

[8] Combining Rayleigh wave phase speed maps at 8 to
40 s periods from ambient noise tomography [Lin et al.,
2008a] and those at 25 to 100 s periods from multiplane
wave tomography, we form broadband Rayleigh wave phase
speed maps at 8 to 100 s periods (Figure 3), a period band
sensitive to depths from the surface to about 160 km. In the
overlapping period range (25–40 s), the methods produce
similar phase speed measurements over most of the study
area except near the borders where station coverage is not
ideal (Figures 3d–3f), and we average the measurements.
3. Model Construction
[9] The set of Rayleigh wave phase speed maps is
inverted for a 3-D isotropic shear velocity (Vs) model on a
0.5  0.5 geographic grid using a two-step procedure.
Figure 3. (a–d) Rayleigh wave phase speed maps derived from ambient noise tomography (ANT) at
periods of 8, 16, 25, and 33 s and (e, g–i) teleseismic multiple-plane wave tomography (MPWT) at 33,
50, 66, and 100 s. The 100 km resolution contour (the bold gray contours) is plotted for reference on the
ANT maps. (f) The difference between the phase speeds determined by ANT and MPWT at 33 s period.
Anomalies are presented as the percent deviation from the average speed across the region at the given
period.

Because only Rayleigh waves are used in the inversion, the
primary sensitivity is to velocity of sv wave (Vsv) and we
have no velocity of sh wave (Vsh) information. Thus,
although we will refer to the model as a Vs model, it is in
fact Vsv. At each point on the spatial grid, the local Rayleigh
wave phase speed curve is constructed from the dispersion
maps and this curve provides the data for the inversion.
[10] The first step is a linearized inversion of the Rayleigh
wave phase speed curve for the best fitting Vs model below
each grid point. In the linearized inversion, depth-dependent
shear wave speeds are parameterized in eleven constant Vs
layers from the Earth’s surface to 200 km depth with three
layers for the crust and eight layers for the upper mantle.
The model parameters are slightly damped and smoothed.
Details about the linearized inversion are described by Yang
and Forsyth [2006a]. Because Rayleigh wave phase speeds
depend primarily on Vs, we scale Vp to Vs using a constant
Vp/Vs ratio of 1.735 in the crust and 1.756 in the mantle
[Chulick and Mooney, 2002]. Because of the trade-off
between Moho depth and Vs in the two layers adjacent to
Moho, in this first step we fix crustal thickness to that
derived from receiver functions [Gilbert and Fouch, 2007].
[11] In the second step, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
resampling of model space [Shapiro and Ritzwoller, 2002;
Yang et al., 2008; G. D. Bensen et al., submitted manuscript,
2008] is performed to quantify the uncertainty in shear
velocity versus depth. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo
inversion executes a random walk through model space
surrounding the starting model derived from the linearized
inversion. At each spatial node, this generates an ensemble
of ‘‘acceptable’’ local 1-D shear velocity models that fit the
Rayleigh wave dispersion curve within specified uncertain-
ties. Depth-dependent shear wave speeds are parameterized
by three crustal layers and five B spline functions in the
upper mantle to represent mantle velocity to a depth of 200
km, rather than by eight layers in the upper mantle in the
linearized inversion. Vs is constrained to increase with depth
monotonically in the crust and vary with depth smoothly in
the mantle. To expedite model space sampling, the veloc-
ities in the crust and upper mantle are allowed to vary within
a ±5% range of the initial model, a range similar to the
variation of S wave speed across the study region from the
linearized inversion. The thicknesses of the upper and
middle crustal layers are fixed, but the thickness of the
lower crust (and hence Moho depth) is allowed to vary from
the initial model within ±5 km. If the predicted dispersion
curve for a candidate model from Markov Chain Monte
Carlo resampling matches the measured curve with an
average misfit of less than twice the dispersion measure-
ment uncertainties, the model is retained and termed ‘‘ac-
ceptable.’’ The dispersion measurement uncertainties
average 5–10 m/s at periods from 8 to 25 s and 10–
15 m/s at periods from 30 to 100 s. Further details about the
Monte Carlo inversion are given by Shapiro and Ritzwoller
[2002] and Yang et al. [2008].
[12] An example of the output from the process at a single
location is plotted in Figures 1b and 1c. For each grid point,
the average of the resulting ensemble of acceptable models
at each depth is taken as the expected value of the Vs model
and the half width of the corridor of the ensemble provides
an estimate of model uncertainty (Figure 1b). By assem-
bling all the 1-D Vs models for each grid point, we form the
3-D model. In principle, the center of the ensemble of
acceptable models may not fit the data and may, therefore,
not be itself acceptable. However, this is not the case here.
The expected value from the center model dose fit the data
within the range of one standard error bars.
[13] To visualize the uncertainty in the 3-D model, we use
the notion of ‘‘persistent features’’ [Shapiro and Ritzwoller,
2002]. An anomaly relative to the average model across the
region is considered to be ‘‘persistent’’ if it appears in every
member of the ensemble of acceptable models; that is, if the
value of the anomaly is greater than the half width of the
corridor of models.
4. The 3-D Model: Discussion
[14] The inversion method is applied across the far
western United States, including all of California, Oregon,
Washington, and the western half of Idaho. The period-
averaged misfit to the dispersion measurements by the 3-D
Vs model is about 10–15 m/s across most of the study area
Figure 4. Period-averaged misfit map presenting the
average of the difference between the observed dispersion
curves and the curves computed from the 3-D Vs model.
The largest misfit occurs west of the Cascade Range where
the ambient noise and multiple plane wave earthquake
tomography are most discordant in the period band of
overlap (Figure 3f).

(Figure 4). The average uncertainties of the 3-D Vs model,
defined as the standard deviation among the ensemble of
acceptable model averaged over the study region, are about
1% in the upper and middle crust and in the mantle below
50 km (Figure 5i) and somewhat larger near the Moho
discontinuity due to the trade-off of Moho depth with Vs at
neighboring depths. These values are about two to three
times smaller than the RMS of the shear velocity anomalies

at the same depth (Figure 5i). Below about 160 km depth,
the RMS of the recovered anomalies crosses over the
uncertainty of the model. We, therefore, interpret features
of the recovered model only above about 160 km. The
resulting 3-D Vs model (Figure 5) with uncertainties shown
in Figure 6 at different depths reveals a wealth of structural
information correlated closely with regional geological
features and tectonics.
[15] In the crust, shear velocity anomalies typically are
similar with depth, except beneath the principal sedimentary
basins such as the Central Valley of California, the Salton
Trough in the Imperial Valley, the Los Angeles Basin, and
the Columbia River Basin (Yakima Fold Belt) near the
Washington – Oregon border. These basins exhibit pro-
nounced low shear wave speeds in the upper crust mainly
due to the slowness of the sediments. The low velocity in
the Yakima Fold Belt could also be due to fracturing in the
folded rock. Low wave speeds are also observed along the
Coast Ranges from California through Washington. The low
speeds in the Californian Coast Range to the south of the
Mendocino Transform may be due to continuous deforma-
tion along the San Andreas fault; while those low speeds in
the Coast Ranges to the north of the Mendocino Transform,
especially the very low speeds near Cape Blanco and in the
Olympic Peninsula, may be due to the accumulation of off-
scraped and metamorphosed sediments resulting from past
and ongoing subduction. The most significant difference
between velocity anomalies in the upper and the middle/
lower crusts (10 km to Moho) (Figure 5b) is that high
velocities underlie the principal sedimentary basins, which
is qualitatively consistent with crustal isostasy. Throughout
the crust, shear wave speeds are high in the Sierra Nevada
and the Peninsular Ranges which are composed primarily of
granitic batholiths and may be colder than other regions in
western United States. The nongranitic southern Cascade
Range is characterized by nearly average wave speeds;
while the granitic north Cascades are fast, like the Sierra
Nevada and the Peninsular Ranges. Strong low speeds are
observed in the very volcanically active back-arc region
from northern California to central Oregon. Modest low
velocities are observed throughout the Basin and Range
province, probably due to elevated crustal temperatures
resulting from relatively thin lithosphere and young mag-
matism and extension [Zandt et al., 1995]. The rest of the
Columbian River Flood Basalt region, besides the Yakima
Fold Belt, and the western Snake River Plain are charac-
terized by high wave speeds throughout the entire crust,
presumably caused by compositional heterogeneity result-
ing from igneous intrusions related to basalt flows [Peng
and Humphreys, 1997; Hales et al. 2005].
[16] In the upper mantle (Figures 5c and 5d), velocity
anomalies are distinct from those observed in the overlying
crust, reflecting decoupling between the crust and upper
mantle. Three sets of prominent high-velocity features are
observed, respectively, beneath (1) the Cascade Range
associated with subduction of oceanic lithosphere, (2) the
southern Great Valley of California and the Transverse Range
associated with lithospheric instability, and (3) eastern
Washington and the northern Rocky Mountains associated
with thick, stable Proterozoic lithosphere. The high-velocity
lithosphere of the subducting Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates
has an apparent thickness of 50–60 km (Figures 5e and 5f),
consistent with its relatively young age, and persists to a
depth greater than our resolvable depth of 160 km. The
edge of the high-velocity slab is seen as a sharp north-
south velocity contrast near the Mendocino Transform
(Figure 5d), coincident with the location of the southern
edge of the Gorda plate. High-velocity anomalies in
southern California are consistent with previous surface wave
studies [e.g., Yang and Forsyth, 2006a, 2006b] and regionalP
wave tomography [Humphreys and Clayton, 1990], and have
been interpreted as lithospheric downwellings or ‘‘drips’’
caused by a Rayleigh-Taylor instability [Humphreys
and Hager, 1990; Biasi and Humphreys, 1992; Zandt and
Carrigan, 1993]. The lithospheric ‘‘drip’’ beneath the south-
ern Central Valley can be seen to reach a depth of 120–

acceptable models produced by the Monte Carlo inversion at the depths of (a) 5, (b) 15, (c) 50, and
(d) 100 km. The largest uncertainties are in the lower crust and uppermost mantle due to the trade-off
between Moho depth and Vs in adjacent layers.

150 km (Figure 5g, profile C-C0), which is somewhat deeper
than that beneath the Transverse Range. High wave speeds
beneath the northern Rocky Mountains extend deeper than
160 km (Figure 5e), which implies that the Proterozoic
lithosphere there was not completely eroded by past tectonic
events such as the Laramide Orogeny, consistent with
earlier P wave tomography [e.g., Dueker et al., 2001].
[17] Slow mantle wave speeds are imaged beneath the
Cascadia arc of northern California, Oregon, and Washing-
ton, above and to the east of the subducting Juan de Fuca
and Gorda plates. These low wave speeds reflect the
influence of subduction on the overlying mantle wedge
and perhaps also the interaction between a continental
plume (the Yellowstone plume) and the upper mantle. In
the northern part of the arc (Figure 5e, profile A-A0), low
speeds are confined to the mantle wedge overlying the
subducting plate with the lowest speeds directly underlying
recently active Cascade volcanoes (Mount St. Helens,
Mount Hood). These low wave speeds are coincident with
the source volume of the volcanic magmas and may be
caused by partial melting produced when volatiles released
from the subducting slab rise into the overlying upper
mantle [Peacock, 1990]. In contrast, in southern Oregon
(Figure 5f, profile B-B0) low wave speeds extend much
further east, underlying the extensive extrusive volcanism of
the high lava plains of southern Oregon and the northern
Basin and Range province. This broad low-velocity anom-
aly, appearing at depths above 120 km, probably reflects
high temperatures in the upper mantle [Camp and Ross,
2004]. The warm lithosphere in this region encompasses
both the Yellowstone and Newberry hot spot tracks, but is
much broader and may reflect plume-fed asthenospheric
flow [Yamamoto et al., 2007] following the impact of the
mantle plume head beneath the lithosphere that occurred
near the boundary of Oregon and Nevada at 16.6 Ma
[Camp and Ross, 2004; Xue and Allen, 2007]. As the
Yellowstone plume moved northeast relative to the North
American plate to its current location beneath Yellowstone,
low velocities imprinted the upper mantle along the Snake
River Plain [Saltzer and Humphreys, 1997]. The low wave
speeds observed in the mantle beneath the western Snake
River Plain slow further toward the east (Figure 5f), as the
date of the last volcanic event approaches the present.
Low seismic waves speeds also underlie the Basin and
Range province but are weaker and may reflect lithospheric
thinning consistent with the buoyant upwelling of astheno-
spheric material in response to the detachment of the
Farallon plate in the post-Laramide era from 50 to
20 Ma [Humphreys et al., 2003].
5. Conclusions
[18] This study merges new methods in seismic imaging
using surface waves with a new kind of seismic array, the
extensive broadband Transportable Array component of
EarthScope/USArray. Ambient noise tomography (ANT)
and multiple plane wave tomography (MPWT) provide
higher resolution information than traditional methods of
surface wave tomography, with ANT producing information
about the crust and uppermost mantle and MPWT generat-
ing information about the mantle. Used together, these
methods deliver dispersion curves across the western United
States from 8 to 100 s period, which impose constraints on
the crust and uppermost mantle to a depth of about 150 km.
Inversion of these Rayleigh wave phase speed curves with a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method generates an isotropic
3-D model with attendant uncertainties. The structural
features that result cohere with known geological structures.
Future advancements will result from incorporating Love
waves and other kinds of seismic information and investi-
gating the generalization of the model to include low-
velocity zones in the crust (if needed) and anisotropy.
[19] By the year 2012, the USArray/TA will have been
moved systematically across the conterminous United
States. The application of the methods presented in this
paper to these data promises to continuously reveal struc-
tural images of the crust and uppermost mantle across the
entire United States in previously unprecedented detail.
