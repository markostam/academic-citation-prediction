ABSTRACT
Bidirectional transcription, leading to the expression
of an antisense (AS) RNA partially complementary to
the protein coding sense (S) RNA, is an emerging
subject in mammals and has been associated with
various processes such as RNA interference, imprint-
ing and transcription inhibition. Homeobox genes do
not escape this bidirectional transcription, raising the
possibility that such AS transcription occurs during
embryonic development and may be involved in the
complexity of regulation of homeobox gene expres-
sion. According to the importance of the Msx1 homeo-
box gene function in craniofacial development,
especially in tooth development, the expression
and regulation of its recently identified AS transcripts
were investigated in vivo in mouse from E9.5 embryo
to newborn, and compared with the S transcript and
the encoded protein expression pattern and regula-
tion. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of
S, AS transcripts and protein are consistent with a role
of AS RNA in the regulation of Msx1 expression in
timely controlled developmental sites. Epithelial–
mesenchymal interactions were shown to control
the spatial organization of S and also AS RNA expres-
sion during early patterning of incisors and molars in
the odontogenic mesenchyme. To conclude, this
study clearly identifies the Msx1 AS RNA involvement
during tooth development and evidences a new
degree of complexity in craniofacial developmental
biology: the implication of endogenous AS RNAs.
INTRODUCTION
Until very recently, the significance of natural antisense (AS)
transcripts was underestimated. AS transcripts in prokaryotes
have been known for at least two decades (1,2) while a limited
number of cases have been reported in eukaryotes. Recent data
have established their importance in eukaryotes (3–5). Indeed,
these transcripts are involved in gene expression regulation
(5) as exemplified by RNA interference, presently applied in
numerous knockdown strategies (6). Natural AS transcripts are
grouped into two classes: cis AS transcripts which are tran-
scribed with the sense (S) transcripts from a unique gene
locus, and trans AS transcripts which are transcribed from
a different locus. Rare data are available on the physiological
impact of AS RNAs during development. For example, in
Caenorhabditis elegans let4 controls the timing of post-
embryonic cell division and fate [for review see (7)]. In
mouse, miR196a negatively regulates Hoxb8 and restricts
Hox homeogene expression pattern (8). Interestingly, these
two AS RNAs belong to the specific subclass of small
RNAs also named microRNA (21–23 nt).
Recent studies have highlighted another subclass of AS
RNAs: the long cis AS (containing >100 bp). In silico studies
based on expressed sequence tag database have predicted that
they may constitute 15% of the mouse genome (9) and >20%
of the human genome (4). Long cis AS transcripts have been
shown to exert regulatory functions on protein expression at
various levels such as epigenetic imprinting, RNA maturation,
edition and translation inhibition (5,10). However, the func-
tional data on AS transcripts have been essentially generated
in vitro. Very few long AS transcripts have been analyzed in
the specific context of mammalian development. Some expres-
sion patterns have been reported: for instance, Hoxa11 AS and

S transcripts show complementary expression territories in
developing limbs (11).
The mouse Msx1 locus has been shown previously to
undergo a bidirectional convergent and overlapping trans-
cription (12). Msx1 AS transcript belongs to the long cis-
AS subclass (2184 nt, in mouse), and was proposed to control
protein expression. This assertion was based on (i) in vitro
evidence of protein down-regulation by the AS transcript, and
(ii) in vivo expression patterns in newborn mouse osteoblasts
(12). Indeed, in the mandibular bone Msx1 AS transcript evi-
denced a complementary expression pattern to the Msx1 S
transcript. More specifically, the Msx1 AS transcript is
expressed in the latest stage of osteoblast maturation (osteo-
cytes) whereas Msx1 S transcript is expressed in preosteoblasts
and osteoblasts (12). According to these observations, it was
hypothesized that Msx1 AS transcript expression is instrumen-
tal in the regulation of osteoblastic cell differentiation. It
would control the progressive reduction of Msx1 homeopro-
tein expression and therefore induce the interdependent cell
cycle exit and differentiation (12). This assertion is supported
by several in vitro and in vivo data on Msx1 homeoprotein. In
vitro, Msx1 overexpression blocks myoblasts differentiation
(13), induces myotubes dedifferentiation into myoblasts and
promotes transdifferentiation into osteoblasts (14). Consis-
tently, in vivo, Msx1 expression is reversely correlated with
cell differentiation progression (15,16).
During embryonic development, Msx1 is instrumental in
various systems, notably in the craniofacial complex where
it acts as a transcriptional repressor (17–21). Msx1 expression
is observed early in development in neural crest cells and their
derivatives, including first branchial arch ectomesenchymal
cells devoted to tooth formation (17,22,23). In mice, the
first evidence of tooth morphogenesis occurs at embryonic
day 11.5 (E11.5) as a thickening of the dental epithelium,
called the dental lamina (24). However, before this morpho-
logical event and as early as E10.5, the respective incisor and
molar fields are already determined. Oral epithelium induces a
site-specific combination of homeobox genes expressions in
the subjacent dental mesenchyme, and these combinations are
organized as an ‘odontogenic homeobox code’ (25–27). Msx1
has been shown to be a key element within this code, specify-
ing the incisor presumptive region at E10.5 (25,28). After
E11.5, tooth morphogenesis is already initiated and the dental
lamina epithelium progressively invades the subjacent
mesenchyme and forms the dental bud (E12.5–E13.5). There-
after, dental development progresses through the cap (E14.5)
and bell stages (E16.5), characterized by tooth-specific mor-
phogenesis and cell differentiation. Tooth morphogenesis is
orchestrated by successive organization centers, called pri-
mary and secondary enamel knots (29). This overall process
of tooth morphogenesis is driven by sequential and reciprocal
interactions between dental epithelium and mesenchyme [for
review see (30,31)]. Msx1 plays a central role in these
epithelial–mesenchymal interactions as evidenced by molar
tooth development arrest at the bud stage in mice lacking
Msx1 (23,32,33).
Finally, during tooth development, Msx1 is important for
two major processes, firstly, the dental field determination and
secondly, the tooth morphogenesis. Msx1 is, therefore, an
exemplary model to analyze cell–cell communication lead-
ing early determination and subsequent morphogenesis in
mammals. Based on this conclusion and on the recent discov-
ery of the endogenous AS transcript of Msx1 (12), the present
study aimed to delineate the timing and impact of this AS
transcript in these established developmental cascades; firstly,
to determine whether Msx1 AS transcript is expressed prior to
the late terminal differentiation stages (12), and secondly,
whether Msx1 AS transcript is instrumental in epithelial–
mesenchymal interactions leading to the two distinct steps
of odontogenesis, namely, tooth field determination (E10.5)
and tooth morphogenesis (E11.5–E16.5). Using different
approaches we have proposed a novel role for Msx1 AS in
tooth development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Embryo collection
Timed matings were set up such that noon of the day on which
vaginal plugs were detected was considered as embryonic day
0.5 (E0.5). Wild-type mouse embryos used for in situ hybri-
dization and explants cultures were collected from matings of
CD-1 mice (Elevage De´pre´, Saint Doulchard). Msx1/nLacZ
heterozygous embryos and Dlx2/LacZ transgenic embryos
were collected from CD-1 females crossed with Msx1/
nLacZ heterozygous males (23) and Dlx2/LacZ transgenic
males (34), respectively. Pregnant mice were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation and the embryos collected from E9.5 to
E18.5. Newborns, 1- and 2-day-old mice were sacrificed by
head cutting.
Msx1/nLacZ and Dlx2/LacZ embryos whole mount
b-galactosidase staining
b-galactosidase activity was evidenced by standard histo-
chemical methods as described previously (35). Briefly, the
embryos were harvested, fixed for 30 min in a 1· phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA), washed in 1· PBS and finally stained overnight at
32C in a PBS 1· solution containing 5 mM potassium ferri-
cyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM magnesium
chloride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 400 mg/ml of X-Gal substrate
(all products from Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier). The
embryos were then fixed overnight in the same fixative solu-
tion and rinsed in PBS 1· before being either photographed,
wax embedded and sectioned, or used for whole mount in situ
hybridization.
In situ hybridization experiments
In situ hybridization experiments were performed for both
Msx1 transcripts and for Dlx2 and Barx1 S transcripts.
Four probes were designed to detect Msx1 transcripts as pre-
sented in Figure 2. Two probes, E2A and E2B, are localized in
Msx1 exon 2 and are complementary for the AS and S tran-
scripts, respectively (Figure 2). These probes were generated
as described previously (12) from a SphI/SphI Msx1 exon 2
960 bp DNA fragment cloned in a bluescript plasmid (18). The
E1 probe, complementary to the S transcript, was obtained
by EcoRI digestion and T7 transcription of a bluescript
plasmid containing the XbaI/EcoRI 368 bp fragment of
Msx1 exon 1 (Figure 2). This fragment was obtained by
PCR amplification. The I probe, complementary to the

AS transcript, was obtained by EcoRI digestion and T7
transcription of a bluescript plasmid containing the SmaI/
SmaI 935 bp fragment of Msx1 intron (Figure 2). The Dlx2
probe was generated as described previously from a bluescript
derivative (named E61) (35). The Barx1 probe was generated,
using EcoRI digestion and T7 transcription, from a bluescript
vector containing a 951 bp Barx1 DNA fragment (kindly
gifted by J. -F. Brunet).
Whole mount digoxigenin-labeled hybridizations were
carried out as described previously (35). Briefly, after protei-
nase K and triethanolamine/acetic anhydride pretreatments,
samples were fixed in 4% PFA before overnight hybridization
at 65C with probe at 1 mg/ml. After post-hybridization
washes, digoxigenin immunodetection was realized with an
antidigoxygenin antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase
(AP) (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan) diluted at 1/2000. The
AP enzymatic activity was finally revealed using NBT/
BCIP solution (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Radioactive (35S-UTP) in situ hybridizations were per-
formed on 7 mm paraffin frontal sections as described pre-
viously (36). Sample sections floated onto polylysine
(Sigma) coated slides were pretreated with proteinase K
(Sigma) and 0.25% (vol/vol) acetic anhydride (Sigma) to
reduce the background. Hybridization was carried out over-
night in a humidified chamber at 60C. The slides were then
washed twice at high stringency (20 min at 60C in 2· SSC,
50% formamide and 10 mM DTT), and treated with 40 mg/ml
RNAse A (Sigma) for 15 min at 37C to remove any non-
specifically bound probe. The high stringency washes were
repeated, followed by a further wash at 60C in 0.1· SSC and
10 mM DTT. Sections were then washed in 0.1· SSC at room
temperature and dehydrated in 300 mM ammonium acetate
(Sigma) in 70%, 95% and absolute ethanol. The slides were
air-dried and dipped in hypercoat LM-1 emulsion (Amersham-
Biosciences, Orsay) and stored at 4C in a light-tight box for
6–8 weeks. They were finally developed using Kodak D19 and
fixed in Kodak UNIFIX (Kodak).
Digoxigenin-labeled in situ hybridizations were performed
on 10 mm cryosections. Sections were hybridized overnight
at 65C in a humidified chamber with 1 mg/ml of probe
in hybridization buffer. The slides were washed twice in
5· SSC, 50% formamide at 65C, then in maleic acid buffer
(MAB) at room temperature (all products were obtained
from Sigma). They were incubated in MAB with 2%
blocking reagent (Roche), 2% lamb serum (Gibco, Cergy-
Pontoise) and a 1/500 dilution of antidigoxigenin
antibody coupled with AP (Roche) at room temperature.
The digoxigenin-labeled probes were detected as described
previously.
Explants cultures
Mandible explants were dissected out from embryos under
a stereomicroscope and, if necessary, treated with 2 U/ml
Dispase (GibcoBRL) in order to separate the epithelium
from mesenchyme. Intact mandibles or isolated
mesenchyme were cultured as described previously (37).
Briefly, all explants were cultured at 37C, 5% CO2 and
40% O2 on 0.1 mm Nuclepore filters (Millipore) in a
Trowell type organ culture dish containing DMEM
(GibcoBRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS; Gibco) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco).
After 12 h of in vitro culture, tissues were treated for 2 min
with 100% ice cold methanol, fixed overnight in 4% PFA at
4C, and processed for whole mount in situ hybridization
analysis.
Recombinant protein bead implantation assays were done as
described previously (38). Heparin acrylic beads (Sigma) were
incubated in Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 (FGF8) protein
(1 mg/ml; R&D). Affi-gel blue beads (BioRad) were incubated
in Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) protein (100 ng/ml;
R&D). About 100 beads were washed with 1· PBS and soaked
with 10 ml of growth factor solution for 1 h at 37C for BMP4
and overnight at 4C for FGF8. The beads were placed on top
of the whole mandible or on top of isolated mesenchyme using
fine forceps. Explants with beads were cultured for 12 h as
described previously.
Cell culture and transfection assays
MD10H1 cell line was obtained by large T antigen immorta-
lization of E18 mouse embryo first molar mesenchyme (39).
These cells were used for transfection assays in triplicate using
Exgen transfection system according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Euromedex, Mundolsheim). Briefly, MD10H1
cells were plated out in a-MEM supplemented with 10%
of FCS (GibcoBRL) at 5 · 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cells
were transfected with 0.5 mg of either Dlx2 or Barx1 expres-
sion vectors (provided by S. Harris and P. T. Sharpe, respec-
tively) or with 0.5 mg of Msx1 AS expression vectors. The
latter one was generated by PCR amplification from a DNA
template with the following primers (50-TTA CAT CCT GGT
GGT CTG AG-30 and 50-CCA GCA TGC ACC CTA CGC
AA-30). The amplified fragment corresponds to the entire AS
transcript. Control transfection experiments were performed
using empty expression plasmids. After 24 h, the medium was
removed, the cells rinsed with 1· PBS and used for RNA
analysis.
RNA analysis
RNA from the transfected cells, from the heads dissected
from E9.5 to E18.5 embryos and from newborn to 2-day-
old mice were extracted using TriReagent (Euromedex) as
described previously (40) and used for RT–PCR. RT was
carried out on 1 mg of total RNA with Superscript II using
oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen). The PCR was performed in 20 ml with 2 ml of
the RT reaction and 10 pmol of the following primers for
30 cycles: Msx1 S (forward primer: 50-TCC TCA AGC
TGC CAG AAG AT-30; reverse primer: 50-TCA GGT GGT

RESULTS
First evidence of Msx1 AS transcript expression during
development
The first evidence for endogenous Msx1 AS transcripts was
shown previously in postnatal mice (12). In order to determine
if Msx1 AS was expressed during embryonic development and
in early postnatal life, semi-quantitative RT–PCR was
performed on RNA from E9.5 to E18.5 embryos and from
day 0 to day 2 newborn mice. These experiments showed that
both Msx1 transcripts were detected as early as E9.5 and
throughout development until postnatal day 2, suggesting a
potential role in embryogenesis (Figure 1).
Msx1 S and AS transcripts and protein expression
from E9.5 to E11.5
Expression of both S and AS Msx1 transcripts was analyzed
during early embryonic development by whole mount in situ
hybridization. The protein expression was analyzed at these
same stages using Msx1/LacZ heterozygous embryos, in
which the LacZ knock in enabled protein expression followed
indirectly (23).
The Msx1 AS transcript was described previously as a 2.1 kb
long transcript which contains sequence overlapping the entire
exon 2 and 1012 bp of the intron of Msx1 gene (Figure 2). Both
the S and AS Msx1 transcripts are complementary in exon 2
sequence. A set of four probes (E1, I, E2A and E2B) was used
for in situ hybridization experiments. The S transcript probe
(E1) was nested in the Msx1 exon 1 since this sequence is
specific to the S transcript (Figure 2). The AS transcript probe
(I) was nested in Msx1 intron since this sequence is specific to
the AS transcript (Figure 2). With the original Msx1 vector
(18) containing part of exon 2 sequence, two probes were
generated. E2A probe was complementary for the AS tran-
script whereas E2B probe was complementary for the S tran-
script (Figure 2). For all experiments the four probes were
used. In all experiments, with the exception of E13.5–
E16.5, detected expression using both S probes produced
the same pattern of expression, as also seen with both the
AS probes.
At E9.5, the Msx1 AS transcript was not detected in man-
dibulary and maxillary regions (Figure 3B and E) but appeared
to be expressed in brain. In contrast, the S transcript (Figure 3A
and D) and protein (Figure 3C and F) were detected in the
Figure 1. Msx1 S and AS transcripts detection from E9.5 to 2 days post natal.
The two Msx1 transcripts were detected by semi-quantitative RT–PCR during
this entire period.
Figure 2. Schematic representation of the two Msx1 transcripts and position of
the four probes used in situ for hybridizations. Msx1 S and AS transcripts
organization in regard of the Msx1 gene structure (accession number
S73812) is schematically presented. The Msx1 S (top) and AS (bottom) tran-
scripts are shown. The S transcript correspond to exons 1 and 2 sequences. The
AS transcript sequence is complementary to the exon2 and a major part of the
intron. Positions of probes used for hybridization are given. Green and red
arrows, respectively, represent S and AS promoter.
Figure 3. Msx1 S and AS transcripts and Msx1 protein expression from E9.5 to
E11.5 in mouse embryos. Both Msx1 transcripts are detected by whole mount in
situ hybridization on wild-type mice embryos. Msx1 protein expression is
revealed by the b-galactosidase activity using Msx1-nLacZ heterozygous
mouse embryos. (A–F) At E9.5, the Msx1 AS transcript is not detected in
the first branchial arch in contrast to the S transcript and the protein. (G–L)
At E10.5, both S and AS Msx1 transcripts are detected in complementary
regions in the mandible. The Msx1 S transcript and the protein are detected
in the distal part of the mandible and the Msx1 AS transcript in the proximal
parts. (M–R) At E11.5, both Msx1 transcripts are detected in progressively
overlapping areas in mandible outlining two reverse gradients, proximal-distal
for the Msx1 AS transcript and distal-proximal for the Msx1 S transcript and the
protein. The bar scale represent 800 mm for whole embryos, and 500 mm for the
mandible.

distal parts of the mandible primordium. In the facial region,
Msx1 AS transcript expression was first detected at E10.5
(Figure 3H and K). At this stage, both Msx1 transcripts
exhibited an interesting opposite pattern in the mandibular
arch. Msx1 AS transcript was detected in the proximal part
of mandible (Figure 3H and K) whereas Msx1 S transcript
(Figure 3G and J) and protein (Figure 3I and L) were still
detected in the distal part of mandible. Msx1 AS transcript was
detected in other anatomical sites such as the future brain and
limb buds (Figure 3H). At E11.5, in the facial region, the
territories of both Msx1 transcripts and protein appeared to
be enlarged and overlapping, corresponding to almost all the
oral part of mandible (Figure 3M–R). Two opposite gradients
of Msx1 S and AS transcript expression patterns were
observed. Msx1 S transcript expression level appeared higher
in the distal region (Figure 3P) and reversely the Msx1 AS
transcript was expressed more significantly in the proximal
regions (Figure 3Q). Protein expression also appeared to be
expressed at a higher level in the distal region (Figure 3R).
Msx1 AS transcript was still detected in the forming brain and
in the limb buds at this stage, (Figure 3N).
Comparative expression of Dlx2, Barx1, Msx1 S and
AS transcripts at E10.5 in presumptive molar and
incisor fields
The expression of Dlx2, Barx1 and both Msx1 transcripts were
comparatively analyzed in the presumptive incisor and molar
fields of E10.5 embryo mandible by whole mount in situ
hybridization. The Msx1 AS transcript was detected in the
proximal regions of the E10.5 mandibular arch (Figure 4A)
whereas the Msx1 S transcript was detected in the distal part of
the mandible (Figure 4C) adjacent to the Dlx2 epithelial
expression (blue in Figure 4C and D). The mesenchymal
expression of Dlx2 (Figure 4B) and Barx1 (Figure 4D) was
evidenced in the proximal area, as was the Msx1 AS expres-
sion. However, the Barx1 mesenchymal expression pattern
appeared more restricted than that of the Dlx2 and Msx1
AS. In the epithelium, the Msx1 AS transcript was not detected
in the distal region of Dlx2 epithelial expression (Figure 4B
and blue LacZ staining in Figure 4C and D).
FGF8 regulates Msx1 AS transcript expression
in mandible explant culture
In order to determine whether Msx1 AS transcript expression
would be integrated in the epithelial signaling pathways that
establish the morphogenetic fields in E10.5 mandible, epithe-
lial induction of Msx1 AS transcript mesenchymal expression
was evaluated in mandibular explants cultures. Interestingly,
12 h after the removal of mandibular arch, a loss of Msx1 AS
transcript expression was observed in the mandibular explant
(Figure 4E). To test the potential induction of Msx1 AS tran-
script expression by epithelium signals, BMP4 and FGF8
soaked beads were applied to the mandibular mesenchyme
explants. After 12 h of culture, Msx1 AS transcript expression
was detected around the FGF8 beads (Figure 4F), as was Msx1
S transcript (Figure 4G), whereas BMP4 or BSA beads had no
effect (Figure 4H and I). In contrast to the AS transcript, the
Msx1 S transcript expression was increased by BMP4 soaked
beads (Figure 4J). To explore a potential inhibitory effect of
Figure 4. Analysis at E10.5 of Msx1 AS transcript potential integration in

transcript expression pattern with Dlx2 and Barx1 transcripts in E10.5
mandible. The Msx1 AS transcript (A), the Dlx2 transcript (B) and the Barx1
transcript (D) were detected in the same proximal regions of the mesenchyme
by whole mount in situ hybridization whereas the Msx1 S transcript (C) was
detected in the distal part of mandible. In contrast, in the epithelium where Dlx2
expression is seen distally there is no associated expression of either Msx1 AS or
Barx1 transcripts expression [LacZ staining in (C) and (D) and arrows in (B)].
(E–K) The Msx1 AS transcript mesenchymal expression pattern in E10.5
mandible is controlled by epithelial signals. (E) The Msx1 AS transcript
expression was absent when the mandible explant is cultured without oral
epithelium. (F) The Msx1 AS transcript mesenchymal expression was restored
around an FGF8 soaked bead as was the Msx1 S transcript expression (G).
Msx1 AS transcript expression was not restored around BMP4 or BSA soaked
beads (H and I). In contrast to the AS transcript, the Msx1 S transcript expression
increased around the BMP4 soaked beads (J). No inhibitory effect on Msx1 AS
transcript expression is observed when BMP4 soaked beads are put in presence
of epithelium (K). (L) The Msx1 AS transcription activation by Dlx2.
MD10H1 cells were transfected with either an empty vector, a Dlx2 expression
vector, or an Msx1 AS transcript expression vector. RNA extracted from these
cells was reverse-transcribed and cDNA analyzed by PCR. Dlx2 overexpres-
sion appears to be able to induce a moderate increase of the Msx1 AS transcript
synthesis whereas Msx1 AS transcript overexpression had no effect on either
Dlx2 or Barx1 expressions. (M) Schematic representation of the regulation of
both Msx1 transcripts by epithelial BMP4 and FGF8 signaling. In proximal
regions of the E10.5 mandible, FGF8 activate Msx1 AS transcript expression
directly or/and potentially through Dlx2 activation. The AS transcript is sus-
pected to inhibit Msx1 homeoprotein expression in these proximal regions
though a mechanism that remains to be elucidated. In the distal region,
BMP4 activates Msx1 S transcript and protein expression and inhibits Dlx2
expression. No direct effect of BMP4 on Msx1 AS transcript expression was
evidenced.

BMP4 on the Msx1 AS transcript expression, mandibular
explants were cultured for 12 h with BMP4 soaked beads
in the presence of epithelium (Figure 4K). No significant
change was observed in the Msx1 AS transcript expression
(Figure 4K).
Impact of Dlx2 and Barx1 overexpression on Msx1 AS
transcript expression in dental cells
As Dlx2 and Barx1 are coexpressed with Msx1 AS transcript in
the proximal parts of E10.5 mouse embryo mandible, a poten-
tial regulation between these genes was analyzed in vitro in
undifferentiated mesenchymal MD10-H1 cells. In order to
examine whether the Msx1 AS transcript could be under the
control of Dlx2 and Barx1 in the mesenchyme, the expression
level of this transcript was analyzed after Dlx2 or Barx1 over-
expression. The semi-quantitative RT–PCR results showed a
small but reproducible increase in Msx1 AS transcript steady
state levels which was observed 24 h after the transfection with
a Dlx2 vector (Figure 4L). Quantitative analyses of Msx1 AS
transcript expression increase after Dlx2 overexpression were
realized using two techniques: real-time PCR (Roche) and
classical PCR fragments quantification on BET gel using Opti-
mate 5.21 (Visiomic). Both techniques showed a moderate
stimulation to 1.2 times that of Msx1 AS transcript steady
state expression. The impact of Dlx2 on Msx1 AS transcript
expression in these experiments is probably underestimated
according to the low transfection efficiency obtained for
MD10-H1 cells (only 35%). Barx1 transcript expression
level was not affected by Dlx2 overexpression (Figure 4L),
nor Dlx2 expression affected by Barx1 overexpression (data
not shown). The controlled overexpression of Msx1 AS tran-
script showed no effect on either Dlx2 or Barx1 expression
levels (Figure 4L).
Msx1 S, AS transcripts and protein expression during
tooth morphogenesis
All in situ hybridization experiments were carried out with the
panel of four different probes (Figure 2). From E9.5 to E12.5,
similar results were obtained with the two probes for Msx1 AS
transcript. The two probes for Msx1 S transcript also gave
identical results. At E11.5, both Msx1 transcripts and the pro-
tein were detected in similar regions of the dental mesenchyme
surrounding the dental lamina (Figure 5A–C). At E12.5, both
Msx1 transcripts and the protein were still detected in the same
anatomical sites, more precisely in the mesenchyme surround-
ing the growing tooth buds (Figure 5D–F). At E13.5, the
probes revealed different expression patterns. The Msx1 S
transcript was detected in the dental mesenchyme
(Figure 5G and H) with both probes (E1 and E2B) and unex-
pectedly in the dental epithelium with the E1 probe
(Figure 5G). The Msx1 AS transcript was detected, with
both AS probes, in the dental epithelium (Figure 5I and J),
and also, at a low level, in the dental mesenchyme. At this
stage, the protein was expressed only in the dental mesench-
yme (Figure 5K). At E16.5, the Msx1 S transcript was detected
by the two probes in the dental mesenchyme (Figure 5L and
M). At this stage, as observed previously at E13.5, an epithelial
expression of Msx1 S transcript was revealed only by the E1
probe (Figure 5L). The Msx1 AS transcript was detected at
E16.5 only in the dental epithelium with whatever probes used
(Figure 5N and O). No protein expression was detectable at
this stage (Figure 5P). In newborns, before the first sign of
odontoblast differentiation, the S and AS transcripts were
detected with E1 (Figure 5Q) and I (Figure 5T) probes, respec-
tively, whereas the exon two probes (Figure 5R and S) gave no
signal.
Msx1 S, AS transcripts and protein expression during
early limb bud development
Msx1 transcripts and protein expression were comparatively
analyzed during anterior limb bud development, from
E9.5 to E14.5, by whole mount in situ hybridization and
b-galactosidase staining (Figure 6). At E9.5, Msx1 S transcript
and protein were detected in the entire limb bud whereas Msx1
AS transcript was absent (Figure 6A–C). At E10.5, similarly to
the observed pattern in the mandible, both Msx1 transcripts
were detected with complementary expression patterns. Msx1
S transcript and protein were detected in the area bordering the
apical ectodermal ridge whereas the Msx1 AS transcript was
detected in a more proximal region, but immediately adjacent
to the Msx1 S transcript positive region (Figure 3G–I and
Figure 6D–F). At E11.5, the Msx1 AS transcript was still
located in an area adjacent to the Msx1 S transcript region
(Figure 3M and N and Figure 6G and H). At E14.5, the Msx1
AS transcript was detected in the proximal part of the inter-
digital regions (Figure 6J), whereas the protein was expressed
with a proximal-distal gradient in the same interdigital areas
and also in tip of digits (Figure 6K).
DISCUSSION
The Msh-like homeobox genes, orthologous to the Muscle
Segment Homeobox gene of Drosophila melanogaster, con-
stitute an ancient family described in numerous species ran-
ging from coelenterates to mammals (20). Inside this family, a
variable number of members have been reported for different
species, corresponding to evolutionary duplications (20).
These genes exhibit a simple genomic structure with two
exons separated by a single intron (41). The Msx1 gene
appears to be the most conserved gene within the Msx family
of mammals and avians (20). Interestingly, a bidirectional
overlapping and convergent transcription was identified for
this Msx1 gene in mouse and human and might also be con-
served in at least three other species: rat, bovine and chicken.
Such a possibility was suggested by the existence of a con-
served identical 60 bp sequence containing a TATA box and
corresponding to the AS promoter region (12). According to
the importance of Msx1 homeoprotein during development
and the preliminary in vitro observation that the Msx1 AS
transcript has the ability to interfere with Msx1 homeoprotein
expression (12), the investigation of the physiological signifi-
cance of the bidirectional transcription of the Msx1 locus
during development appeared to be important. The experimen-
tal strategy was to investigate the presence of the Msx1 AS
transcript during mouse embryogenesis by RT–PCR, to ana-
lyze its expression pattern in comparison with the Msx1 S
transcript and the protein in tooth and other significant devel-
oping systems where Msx1 signaling pathways are instrumen-
tal (42–44), and finally to analyze its potential regulation by
epithelial signals.

Evidence for Msx1 AS transcript expression during
embryonic development
The Msx1 AS transcript was originally identified in newborn
and young adult mice (12), in association with skeletal growth.
Msx1 AS transcript was proposed to be instrumental postna-
tally in terminal differentiation, by inhibiting Msx1 protein
expression (12,45). Indeed, Msx1 homeoprotein expressing
cells were considered as undifferentiated cells, based on
in vitro observations that Msx1 (i) inhibits master gene expres-
sion such as MyoD (46) and Runx2 (12), (ii) modulates the
expression of cell cycle determinants such as cyclin D1 (47)
and p19(INK4d) (48), (iii) induces dedifferentiation of myo-
tubes (14), and (iv) is specifically present in progenitor cell
niches in adults (49). Interestingly, the initial analysis of Msx1
AS transcript expression during antenatal mouse development
(Figure 1) revealed that, similar to the S transcript, the Msx1
AS transcript was already expressed at E9.5 before the initial
steps of skeleton morphogenesis and cell differentiation, and
continuously up to birth. These data suggest that the Msx1
bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcription may
not only be linked to the control of cell terminal differentiation
but also implicated in more complex processes during devel-
opment, such as dental and skeletal morphogenesis.
Figure 5. Msx1 S and AS transcript detection and Msx1 protein expression during mouse tooth development from E11.5 to birth. Both transcripts of Msx1 were
detected by in situ hybridization in wild-type mouse embryonic serial sections in comparison with LacZ expression in Msx1/LacZ hereterozygotes. (A–C) At E11.5,
both Msx1 transcripts were detected whatever the probes used in the dental mesenchyme as was LacZ. (D–F) At E12.5, both Msx1 transcripts were detected whatever
the probes used along with LacZ in the dental mesenchyme but in a more restricted area than at E11.5, surrounding the tooth buds. (G–K) At E13.5, the expression
patterns of the both Msx1 transcripts were more complex. Using E1 probe, the Msx1 S transcript was detected in both dental mesenchyme and epithelium (G). Using
E2B probe, the Msx1 S transcript is only detected in dental mesenchyme surrounding the tooth bud (H). Using E2A and I probes, the Msx1 AS transcript is detected in
both dental epithelium and mesenchyme (I and J). LacZ expression was only detected in the dental mesenchyme surrounding the tooth bud and the epithelium was
clearly devoid (K). (L–P) At E16.5, the Msx1 S transcript was detected in dental epithelium and mesenchyme with the E1 probe whereas it was only detected in
mesenchyme with E2B probe. Msx1 AS transcript detection was restricted to the dental epithelium independently of the probe used. No Msx1 fusion protein
expression was detected at this stage. (Q–T) At birth, the Msx1 S transcript was detected in dental epithelium and mesenchyme only with the E1 probe. The Msx1 AS
transcript was detected in both dental tissues only with the I probes. (U) Experimental control (Ctrl) corresponding to the use of unlabeled probe. (Md: mandible;

In the past, Msx1 gene expression has been documented in
numerous developing organs and systems, notably, heart
(18,50), brain (51), limb (50), mammary glands (52), hair
follicles (43,50) and teeth (22,28,33). Due to the detailed
analysis of the role of Msx1 during odontogenesis, experimen-
tal studies of Msx1 AS transcript were carried out in this
developmental model system. In addition, Msx1 protein
expression was compared with the AS transcript throughout
tooth morphogenesis stages and showed a continuous expres-
sion until late bell stage (E16.5). The results suggest that,
during tooth development, Msx1 AS transcript may not only
be involved in cell terminal differentiation control as proposed
previously (12), but also in tooth initiation and subsequent
morphogenesis through the control of Msx1 homeoprotein
expression and function.
The most important result obtained here was that both S and
AS Msx1 transcripts were present during embryonic develop-
ment. Indeed, it appeared that during development, when an
organ expressed Msx1 S transcript and protein, it also
expressed the AS transcript. This observation was not only
verified in tooth but also in bone (12), hair follicles (data not
shown), neural tube (data not shown) and limb bud (Figure 6).
Msx1 AS transcript and tooth initiation
Msx1 (S transcript) has been proposed to be an important
factor in the odontogenic homeobox code proposed to define
the different tooth fields at E10.5 in mouse prior to the mor-
phological appearance of tooth formation (25–27). This
homeobox code is based on combinations of homeobox
gene expression patterning territories in the first branchial
arch neural crest derived mesenchyme (37,53–56). In this
homeobox code, Msx1 may define the incisor region (28)
whereas Barx1 in combination with Dlx2 specifies molar
region (27,57,58). This assertion is exemplified in Msx1
knock out mice which exhibit no initiation of incisor devel-
opment in contrast to molars where development is blocked
later at the bud stages (32). To understand further the means of
spatially restricting the expression of the Msx1 homeoprotein,
the role of Msx1 AS transcript in the control of protein expres-
sion was considered. Our data showed that at E9.5 Msx1 AS
transcript was not expressed in the mandibular arch in contrast
to the S transcript, whereas at E10.5 Msx1 AS transcript was
detected and presented an expression pattern complementary
to the S transcript and protein. Such a result suggests that Msx1
AS transcript could participate to Msx1 homeoprotein expres-
sion restriction within the distal region of the mandible. At this
stage, some homeobox containing gene expression patterns in
the mesenchyme are driven by epithelial signaling
(28,31,33,34,37,54,59,60). Two major signaling molecules
implicated are growth factors BMP4 and FGF8. They are
secreted by the distal and proximal parts of the mandibular
oral epithelium, respectively. Effects of these diffusible
growth factors on Msx1, Barx1 and Dlx2 expression have
been established by application of protein soaked beads in
mandibular explant cultures. These experiments show that
mesenchymal expression of Barx1 and Dlx2 is induced by
FGF8 while inhibited by BMP4 (34,53,61). In contrast,
Msx1 S transcript appears to be induced around both FGF8
and BMP4 soaked beads (28,33,37,53) raising the question of
Msx1 S transcript expression control (inhibition) in the mand-
ible proximal parts in vivo. Interestingly, at E10.5, Msx1 AS
transcript showed an expression pattern in the mesenchyme of
the mandible similar to those of Barx1 and Dlx2 (Figure 4A, B
and D) and in opposition to Msx1 S transcript and homeopro-
tein expression pattern (Figure 4C). The presently reported
expression of Msx1 AS transcript lead to propose a hypothesis:
the AS RNA would inhibit S RNA and protein expression in
the proximal parts of the mandible by a mechanism that still
remains to be elucidated but that could occur at transcriptional
level according to the absence of S transcript detection. The
present soak-beads experiments provided evidence that the
mesenchymal expression of Msx1 AS transcript at E10.5 is
indeed responsive to FGF8 and not BMP4 (Figure 4F, I and K).
Interestingly, the Msx1 AS transcript activation by FGF8 at
E10.5 appears to be correlated to an absence of Msx1 S tran-
script response to this growth factor, while beads experiments
suggest that Msx1 S transcript should be activated (Figure 4G).
In vitro overexpression experiments in mesenchymal MD10-
H1 dental cells (39) show that Msx1 AS transcript expression
may be regulated by Dlx2 but not by Barx1 (Figure 4L),
suggesting that Dlx-2 could act as an intermediary in the
pathway between FGF8 and Msx1 AS. A schematic represen-
tation of FGF8 and BMP4 differential regulation of both Msx1

plementary expression pattern (J and K). The bar scale represent 200 mm.

transcripts mesenchymal expression in the E10.5 mandible is
presented in Figure 4M.
Finally, Msx1 AS transcript appeared to be inserted inside
the homeobox code at E10.5 through its joint expression in the
proximal region with Barx1 and Dlx2. At this developmental
stage, the obtained data suggest that Msx1 AS transcript would
spatially limit Msx1 S transcript and protein expression areas.
The exclusive Msx1 AS transcript expression might result in
the complete inhibition of Msx1 S transcript expression by a
mechanism that remains to be elucidated.
Msx1 AS transcript and tooth morphogenesis
During tooth morphogenesis, Msx1 (S transcript) was shown to
be expressed in the mesenchyme with a progressive restriction,
from E11.5 to E12.5, to the dental mesenchyme surrounding
both incisor and molar buds (22,62,63) (Figure 5). The
importance of epithelial signaling, in particular BMP4
expression, in such a restriction has been shown and corre-
sponds to a crucial step in the tooth morphogenesis process
(31,33). Moreover, the importance of Msx1 homeoprotein
expression in dental mesenchyme is evidenced by the obser-
vation of molar development arrest at the bud stage (E13.5) in
Msx1 null mutant mice (32). Recombination experiments
between wild-type and Msx1 null mutant dental tissues showed
that Msx1 mesenchymal expression is transiently necessary at
the early bud stage (33) mainly to induce BMP4 expression in
the dental mesenchyme as validated by BMP4 complementa-
tion experiment using transgenic animals (64,65). Indeed, the
important function of Msx1 homeoprotein in tooth morpho-
genesis is its implication in epithelial–mesenchymal interac-
tions and the question of the AS transcript part in this function
control is raised from this point of view. Our results showed
that Msx1 AS transcript was continuously expressed during
tooth morphogenesis with a stage-specific pattern. At the den-
tal lamina stage (E11.5), the AS transcript was detected jointly
with the S transcript in the mesenchyme and by E12.5, its
expression was progressively restricted to the mesenchyme
area surrounding the epithelial invagination, as reported pre-
viously for the S transcript. At the following stages (cap and
bell stages), the Msx1 S and AS transcripts expression patterns
diverge showing a complementary in the mesenchyme. The S
transcript was expressed in the dental cells which will differ-
entiate into odontoblasts and pulp cells whereas the AS tran-
script was expressed in cells which will give rise to the
follicular sac and alveolar bone. However, the function asso-
ciated to such a distribution of the two transcripts remains
unclear. Concerning Msx1 S and AS transcript expression
in dental epithelium (detected only with certain probes), the
situation is even more complex and discussed below. Indeed,
according to our data whatever be the stage of tooth morpho-
genesis Msx1 homeoprotein expression was restricted to the
mesenchyme. Finally, our result establishes that during tooth
morphogenesis, Msx1 AS transcript showed a dynamic expres-
sion pattern relative to the S transcript and the protein suggest-
ing its implication in the protein localization and expression
level.
In conclusion, regarding Msx1 transcripts and relative
protein expression during tooth morphogenesis, five distinct
situations were identified depending on the developmental
stages, areas and tissues: no expression (at E11.5–E12.5 in
the epithelium), exclusive expression of S transcript (at E14.5
and E16.5 in dental mesenchyme), exclusive expression of AS
transcript (at E16.5 in epithelial regions such as stellate reti-
culum and stratum intermedium), coexpression of S and AS (i)
with all probes (E11.5–E12.5) or (ii) with certain probes (at
E13.5, E16.5 and D0). The differences observed with the set of
probes used could be explained by the complementarities of S
and AS exon 2 sequences. Indeed, the exclusive results
obtained with S and AS specific probes suggest that at
E13.5, E16.5 and D0 the overlapping sequence from both
transcripts are not accessible to exon two probes. So, we
hypothesized that S and AS transcripts could physically inter-
fere and impair riboprobe hybridization in this area. Function-
ally, the five situations should be considered through the
narrow window of AS RNA knowledge. Several transcrip-
tional and post-transcriptional events are candidates for the
inhibition of Msx1 homeoprotein. These events have been
recently reviewed and classified in four categories (5). Tran-
scriptional interference and S gene silencing ends with exclu-
sive expression of AS RNA. Posttranscriptional mechanisms
(RNA masking and degradation) are those which involve
S–AS coexpression and finely tuned ratios of S/AS transcripts
or modifications in RNAs overlapping sequences. According
to coexpression or distinct expression patterns of both Msx1
transcripts, the bidirectional convergent and overlapping
transcription system would function differently. In the case
of distinct expression pattern of S and AS transcripts, tran-
scriptional interference or gene silencing could be implied,
whereas, in the case of coexpression, RNA masking and degra-
dation could be involved (5,66,67). Hence two types of ratio
threshold could be defined. A macrothresholding when only
one kind of Msx1 transcript is expressed (E9.5–E10.5) and a
microthresholding (E13.5–E16.5-D0) when the two transcripts
are coexpressed. Further complementary studies at the cellular
level would be necessary to clearly establish the presumably
distinct mechanisms.
Natural antisense transcripts: a growing list
The Msx1 AS transcript is not an isolated case of large natural
AS RNA. Bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcrip-
tion is an emerging field opening a previously unsuspected
level of complexity in protein expression regulation (5). AS
transcripts have been associated with different processes dur-
ing development including parental imprinting (68), develop-
mental clock control (7) and transcriptional regulation (5). The
precise molecular modalities of such a control are not clarified.
However, in vitro experiments have established the impor-
tance of the relative ratio of the two transcripts. This has
been shown previously for Msx1 by in vivo observations of
the two transcripts distribution during osteoblast differentia-
tion process (12).
Interestingly, Msx1 is not the only gene implicated in max-
illofacial and limb development showing a bidirectional con-
vergent and overlapping transcription. Thus, homeobox
containing genes belonging to the Dlx gene family have
also AS transcripts. This is the case for Dlx1 (69) and Dlx6
(67) genes. AS transcripts were also described for other diver-
gent homeobox genes as Otx2 (70) and members of the Hox
clusters such as HoxA11 (11) and HoxD3 (71), raising the
question of the general importance of bidirectional convergent

and overlapping transcription during development. In vitro
studies have established that (i) Msx and Dlx homeoproteins
can form heterodimers through their homeodomains and
consequently inhibit each other’s transcriptional activity
(21) (F. Lezot, unpublished data) and (ii) that Dlx5 (12)
and Dlx2 (this study) homeoproteins can differentially modu-
lated Msx1 AS transcript expression, and thus Msx1 homeo-
protein expression. These in vitro observations strongly
suggest that understanding AS transcript integration in devel-
opmental signaling pathways will be a difficult, but necessary
challenge for the next decade. Interestingly, 9 out of 248 genes
shown to be involved in tooth development (indexed on http://
bite-it.helsinki.fi) have so far been shown to have AS tran-
scripts. Moreover, computer analysis of available human and
mouse genome sequences have shown that 15 and 20% of the
mouse and human genes can have AS transcript, respectively
(4,9). Finally it appears that the importance of AS transcripts is
largely underestimated concerning development and more
precisely during tooth development. ‘Making sense with
antisense’ may be operative for the understanding of morpho-
genetic gradients in developmental biology.
