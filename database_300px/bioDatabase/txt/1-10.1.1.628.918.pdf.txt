J. Strength Cond. Res. 21(2):470–475. 2007.—The aim of the
present study was to analyze the effect of whole-body vibration
on energy expenditure, as well as on exercise intensity, during
and immediately after a typical set of exercises for muscle hy-
pertrophy in physically active subjects. Seventeen male univer-
sity students (mean age 18.3  0.24 years) volunteered to per-
form 2 different training exercises: half squat (HS), and half
squat with vibration (HSV). Both exercises were performed by
all subjects on the vibration platform (with vibration only for
HSV), the sequence order being assigned randomly. Energy ex-
penditure (EE), respiratory exchange ratio, perceived exertion
(PE), and heart rate were recorded for baseline, exercise, and
short-recovery conditions. Training consisted of 5 sets of 10 rep-
etitions of HS and HSV, with a 2-minute recovery interval be-
tween sets. Analysis of variance with repeated measurements
and Bonferroni correction, as well as effect size were used for
statistical calculations. Results indicated that EE and PE were
significantly higher in the HSV group, during both exercise and
recovery. Heart rate did not differ significantly between groups.
Thus, it would appear that HS strength training could be ren-
dered more energy-efficient through the addition of vibration.
Moreover, it would be feasible to introduce vibration exercises
into regular training programs, particularly those whose key ob-
jective is muscle hypertrophy along with fat reduction.

INTRODUCTION
T he loss of a steady state resulting in a positiveenergy balance includes metabolic adjustmentsthat might force biological changes, such as ad-ipogenesis and an increased risk of nontrans-
mittable chronic diseases (39). The long-term efficiency of
most dietary strategies aimed at achieving a negative en-
ergy balance remains doubtful if sedentary lifestyles are
not modified (40). The use of low-calorie diets, either
alone or in conjunction with aerobic exercise, usually pro-
motes the loss of adipose tissue but may also induce some
loss of fat-free mass, thus reducing the resting metabolic
rate (RMR) (10). Resistance training, in contrast, increas-
es fat-free mass and enhances catecholamine secretion,
thus maintaining or even raising the RMR (10, 11, 41).
Whole-body vibration (WBV) training is increasingly
being used to improve performance (4–6, 13, 16, 23) and
to treat neuromuscular (31) and bone pathologies (34, 38).
It has been reported that 5 weeks of WBV training sig-
nificantly improve strength and power in comparison to
the same training carried out without vibration; at the
same time, WBV training induces trophic improvements
in muscle (33). Moreover, Bosco et al. (6) report that WBV
training prompts an increase in plasma concentrations of
testosterone and growth hormone, and a decrease in cor-
tisol levels, thus affording metabolic benefits in addition
to increased motor unit efficiency.
In terms of bioenergetics, it has been demonstrated
that resistance training involving WBV produces an in-
crease in oxygen uptake, and therefore in energy expen-
diture (EE) in comparison to the same exercise without
WBV (32). It has further been reported that this increase
can be parametrically controlled by frequency, amplitude,
and the external load applied during WBV (32). Relative-
ly few studies, however, address the effect of additional
WBV on energy expenditure during a set of half squat
(HS) exercises, which are common in programs designed
to increase strength and muscle hypertrophy. To the best
of our knowledge, no direct data are available on the pos-
sible energy benefits of this type of training.
Since WBV has been shown to increase energy expen-
diture, it was hypothesized that the application of vibra-
tion to HS exercises typically used to produce muscle hy-
pertrophy would provide enhanced metabolic power. The
purpose of the present study, therefore, was to analyze
the influence of whole-body vibration on energy expen-
diture, during both the active exercise phase and the
short-recovery phase.
METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem
Participants underwent an initial 2-week period of famil-
iarization with HS training, after which all subjects per-
formed 2 different training sessions in a counterbalanced
crossover design, HS and HSV, separated by intervals of
48 to 72 hours. The order in which each participant un-
derwent the 2 different sessions was assigned randomly.
Each participant acted as his own control. At each ses-
sion, energy expenditure (EE) was measured (kcal per
minute and kcal per session), together with the respira-
tory exchange ratio (RER), in order to determine the ef-
fect of WBV on these variables. Heart rate (HR) and per-
ceived exertion (PE) were also recorded, since these var-
iables are representative of effort intensity.
Subjects
Seventeen healthy male university students participated
voluntarily in this research project. All of them were
physically active. A physician reviewed their medical rec-
ords, and volunteers who had previous severe neuromus-
cular or bone pathologies, epilepsy, or a history of chronic
or metabolic disease were excluded. None of the subjects
had any previous experience with WBV training; howev-
er, all subjects had been performing resistance training
for at least 6 months prior to the study, with a minimum
frequency of 2 sessions per week and a maximum of 4.
Over the whole experimental period, subjects refrained
from performing any exercise other than that required for

this research. Prior to participation, and in accordance
with procedures approved by the University Institutional
Review Board for human subjects, each subject was in-
formed—both verbally and in writing—of all procedures,
potential risks, and benefits associated with the study,
and signed an informed consent form prior to inclusion.
After an overnight fast of not less than 10 hours, subjects
arrived at the laboratory, where they rested for 20 min-
utes. At the end of this period, their resting metabolic
rate was measured using an automatic breath-by-breath
gas analysis system (CPX, MedGraphics, St. Paul, MN).
Blood pressure and resting heart rate were also mea-
sured. Body composition was assessed by skinfold thick-
ness, while body density (g·cm3) was calculated using the
Durnin and Womersley equations (17); percentage of body
fat was determined using the equations formulated by
Brozek et al. (9). Physical and body-composition charac-
teristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1.
Ten Repetition Maximum Testing
To calculate the 10 repetition maximum (10RM) for each
subject, a standardized procedure was used for the sub-
maximum strength test proposed by Kraemer and Fry
(24). The mass of all weight plates that were used was
determined with a precision scale. The actual mass of all
plates was used to calculate 10RM in the HS exercise.
Several strategies were implemented in order to minimize
possible errors in 10RM testing: (a) all subjects were giv-
en identical information about how to perform the tests
and how the data would be assessed, (b) individual ex-
ercise techniques of subjects were monitored and correct-
ed as required throughout the training sessions, and (c)
all subjects received verbal encouragement during test-
ing. For a repetition to be successful, the range of motion
typical for this exercise had to be completed. For this pur-
pose, subjects were placed in a half-squat position, with
shoulders touching the bar; the starting knee angle for
movement execution was set at 90. During each repeti-
tion, the subjects started from the 90 flexed-knee posi-
tion and performed concentric extension of the leg mus-
cles (hip, knee, and ankle) until reaching full extension
at 180, thereafter returning to the initial 90 position,
with no pauses between the 10 repetitions.
Familiarization Training
During the 2 weeks of familiarization training, subjects
performed HS exercises on a multipower machine
(GervaSport, Madrid, Spain) at a rate of 1 repetition ev-
ery 4 seconds (2-second eccentric phase plus 2-second con-
centric phase), controlled by a digital metronome. The
training protocol is described in Table 2. Prior to each
training session, subjects performed 5 minutes of stand-
ing stretch exercises. To be able to perform all 10-repe-
tition sets required, subjects were allowed to decrease
slightly (by a maximum of 10%) the load calculated using
the 10RM test. To guarantee that all sets were performed
with maximal intensity during this period, an adaptation
of the categorization of effort (CE) system was used (19).
The CE score is expressed by the relationship between
the number of repetitions carried out per set (those which
the subject manages to do) and those required by the
training; this relationship thus indicates exercise inten-
sity. Scores are divided into 3 categories: nonmaximum
CE (the subject is capable of doing more repetitions than
those imposed), maximum CE (the subject cannot do any
more repetitions than those imposed) and supramaxi-
mum CE (the subject does not manage to complete the
repetitions required by the training). The CE system was
adapted to the bout of exercises used here, i.e., if CE were
maximum the subject would not be able to perform a sin-
gle further repetition after completing the last set of ex-
ercises (Table 2).
Treatment Procedure
A protocol of 10 repetitions maximum (10RM) was used
for HS exercises to stimulate a relatively high metabolic
level. For assessment purposes, all subjects were random-
ly tested while performing HS and HSV exercises (Table
2). Both exercises were performed on a vibration platform
(NEMES, Ergotest, Italy); however, vertical sinusoidal vi-
brations were only applied to the HSV group, at a fre-
quency of 30 Hz and an amplitude of 4 mm. The external
load used in HS and HSV was 5% lower than that at-
tained on the final day of familiarization, in order to en-

sure completion of the bout of 5 sets of 10 repetitions even
during the application of WBV. Since the aim of this
study was not to assess the effects of specific dietary ma-
nipulation, but rather the effects of exercise under normal
conditions, subjects were allowed to eat a typical snack 1
hour before each test. The food composition and nutri-
tional contribution of the snack are shown in Table 3.
Energy Expenditure
The pre-exercise V˙O2 (baseline resting metabolic rate) and
RER for the HS and HSV groups were determined with
the individuals standing up straight and relaxed for a 3-
minute period. During each type of exercise, including the
rest intervals between sets and the first 4 minutes of re-
covery, V˙O2 and RER were measured continuously, re-
cording data every 30 seconds. All oxygen consumption
values were automatically converted by the software
(Breeze Ex, MedGraphics, St. Paul, MN) into kcal per
minute as an expression of EE at each stage. Subsequent-
ly, EE for the total bout of exercises (5 sets plus rest in-
tervals) was calculated for HS and HSV (kcal per 11.5
minutes).
Perceived Exertion and Heart Rate
Heart rate was continuously monitored during training
as well as at 5 minutes post exercise (Polar 510; Polar,
Kempele, Finland). Following each set, subjects rate PE
according to the Borg perceived exertion scale (CR10) (2),
information on which was provided both verbally and in
writing prior to training (18). Since subjects were wearing
masks during training, and could not talk, they were
asked at the end of each set to point at the appropriate
PE rating on a copy of the scale placed on the wall
throughout training. At 5 minutes post exercise, subjects
rated their overall PE (15).
Reproducibility of Measurements
In a pilot study performed with 5 of the subjects in con-
ditions similar to those of the study protocol, the interday
reproducibility for variables EE and RER was found to be
high. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for pre-ex-
ercise, exercise, and recovery conditions were as follows:
EE: 0.96, 0.98, 0.95; and RER: 0.90, 0.91, 0.89.
Statistical Analyses
Traditional statistical methods were used to calculate
mean values and SD. Sample normality was checked us-
ing the Shapiro-Wilk test. A Student’s t-test was used to
assess the effect of familiarization on the 10RM variable.
The effect of independent variables (HS and HSV) on EE,
RER, HR, and PE (dependent variables) was analyzed by
analysis of variance (ANOVA). A Bonferroni correction
was used to adjust p values to reflect the number of con-
trasts performed. Effect size was calculated for paired
variables (14). Rhea’s scale was used to interpret the
magnitude of effects in strength training: magnitude was
thus classified as trivial (0.50), small (0.50–1.25), mod-
erate (1.25–1.9) or large (2) (30). Statistical significance
was expressed as follows: p  0.05 (*), p  0.001 (***).
The significance level was set at p  0.05 (*).The SPSS
(version 11.5; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) software package
for Windows was used for all statistical tests.
RESULTS
By the end of the familiarization period, subjects had ex-
perienced a significant (p  0.001) increase in the 10RM
load (16.8%); values are shown in Table 4. However, in
order to complete all 10-repetition sets for both HS and
HSV, the load had to be decreased somewhat, to 56.7 (
11.0) kg.
The values and statistical significance for the vari-
ables analyzed in this study for both conditions (HS and
HSV) are described below; effect size and mean difference
for all variables are shown in Table 5.
Energy Expenditure
Prior to exercise, there was no difference in EE between
the HSV and HS groups (1.63  0.30 and 1.59  0.30
kcal·min1, respectively). Energy expenditure increased
significantly during physical exercise and recovery in
both groups (p  0.001) (Figure 1). There were no signif-
icant differences between pre-exercise RER values for the
2 groups (HSV  0.96  0.10 and HS  0.98  0.09);
RER increased significantly only in the HSV group dur-
ing exercise (p  0.001), and high levels were maintained
during the recovery stage (p  0.001) (Figure 2). Com-

showed that the application of WBV had a significant ef-
fect on EE (4.50  0.72 vs. 3.84  0.79 kcal·min1, p 
0.001) and RER (1.23  0.13 vs. 1.16  0.10, p  0.05).
Similarly, during the recovery stage, the HSV group also
had displayed higher EE than the HS group (3.30  0.66
vs. 2.70 0.47 kcal·min1 respectively, p 0.001), where-
as the RER for the 2 groups evened out during the recov-
ery period (HSV  1.28  0.11 and HS  1.27  0.13).
Total EE for the HSV bout was significantly higher than
for the HS bout (52.0  8.34 vs. 44.2  9.10 kcal, p 
0.05).
Heart Rate
Heart rate values were higher for the HSV group during
each of the 5 training sets, and slightly lower 5 minutes
into the recovery stage; however, differences between
groups were not significant in either case (Figure 3).
Perceived Exertion
The PE of the HSV group was significantly higher from
the second training set (p  0.05) (Figure 4). The overall
perception of HSV training, recorded after 5 minutes of
passive recovery, was also higher than for HS training (p
 0.05) (Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
This study assessed the effect of whole-body vibration, at
a predetermined amplitude and frequency, on energy ex-
penditure when performing half-squat exercises with an
external load of 10RM. Assessment was based on contin-
uous indirect calorimetry throughout the pre-exercise
rest period, exercise, rest intervals between sets, and the
acute recovery stage. As expected, EE during HSV was
significantly higher than during HS alone; HSV was
found to provide a stimulus similar to that experienced
by a subject of similar weight during moderate walking
at 4 km per hour (28). Subjects’ perceived exertion rating
was also higher for HSV.
474 DA SILVA, FERNANDEZ, CASTILLO ET AL.
Although familiarization training was intended sim-
ply to familiarize subjects with the specific movements
required for HS exercises, there was a significant change
in 10RM as a result of familiarization. This is readily at-
tributable to the fact that most subjects did not previously
perform HS as part of their routine training; it is widely
documented that changes in the type of exercise, number
of sets, or repetitions can prompt a short-term increase
in strength (29).
Energy expenditure during HSV training was 17%
higher than for HS. This appears to confirm that the high
metabolic load resulting from resistance training (10RM)
(25) may be complemented by additional neuroendocrine
stimulation derived from the involuntary contractions
provoked by the vibrations (32).
Although Rittweger et al. (32) obtained energy-expen-
diture equivalents for resistance exercise with WBV, they
studied exercise (squatting with or without load) with
added vibration only over 1 uninterrupted 3-minute pe-
riod. This type of exercise cannot readily be repeated or
combined with other regular resistance-training exercis-
es. The present study recorded significant energy-expen-
diture increases as a result of applying vibration, al-
though increases were less marked than those reported
by Rittweger et al. (32). In general terms, results are com-
parable, and the real exercise-sets studied here could be
viably included in a resistance training protocol, since
they cover the active phase, the rest intervals between
sets, a commonly-used time period, external load, and tol-
erable vibrations.
The 6% increase in RER observed in HSV compared
to HS might reflect the greater intensity of work resulting
from WBV, and the greater need to disperse CO2 and oth-
er metabolic products. Even though increased use of car-
bohydrates has been reported in predominant anaerobic
glycogenolytic pathways during this type of strength
training (36), there is also high lactate production (27).
Acidosis would not make RER a viable predictor of sub-
strate oxidation, since its buffering, via bicarbonate, in-
creases the excretion of CO2 without increasing O2 up-
take, thus raising RER (28).
With regard to the recovery period, 1 limitation of the
present study was the short duration of the period ana-
lyzed (4 minutes) and the lack of lactic acid monitoring,
which meant that the behavior of EE and RER after the
acute recovery period could not be investigated.
During the 4-minute recovery stage, energy expendi-
ture was 22% higher in the HSV group than in the HS
group, reflecting additional post-exercise metabolic activ-
ity following the application of WBV. It has been sug-
gested that hypertrophy strength training generates sus-
tained increases in anabolizing hormone levels, and that
the magnitude of this effect is correlated with the lactos-
emia achieved during effort (21), reflecting the neuroen-
docrine response necessary for repair processes (12).
Moreover, the existence of a correlation between the in-
tensity of resistance training and the magnitude and du-
ration of higher post-exercise oxygen consumption levels
(3, 37) suggests that application of WBV may optimize
these effects and therefore optimize post-exercise energy
expenditure.
The RER values in both exercise groups (HSV and HS)
were higher (28 and 27%, respectively) during the recov-
ery stage than pre-exercise, with no significant difference
between the 2 groups. As indicated earlier, the post-ex-
ercise lactic acid load means that these RER values could
not be used as indicators of the use of specific substrates.
However, it has been reported that a high RER is ob-
served in the first few minutes of recovery following re-
sistance exercises; from then on it decreases significantly
to below baseline values (1) and even below the RER pro-
duced in the recovery stage following treadmill exercises
(7). This may point to increased lipid oxidation after re-
sistance exercises, when lactic acid values fall without
modifying the RER (1). In this respect, it has been sug-
gested that intense exercise, a decisive factor in gluco-
genic depletion, is likely to induce a compensatory car-
bohydrate storing mechanism while also increasing lipid
oxidation during recovery (8). If this is so, the application
of vibrations to hypertrophy strength training could be
considered to add more intensity to the effort, thus per-
haps increasing post-exercise fat oxidation.
The higher heart rate recorded in the HSV group, al-
though not statistically significant, agrees with the find-
ings of other studies, which report increased HR during
a short period of exposure to WBV (22, 35). After 5 min-
utes of recovery time, the heart rate of the HSV group
was lower than that of the HS group, suggesting a faster
recovery. Guignard, similarly, notes increased HR during
exposure to WBV, followed by a rapid return to HR base-
line values in the acute recovery stage (20).
PE was significantly higher during HSV following the
first set, presenting high values in the last 2 sets, reflect-
ing greater intensity in this exercise. A strong correlation
has been reported between the levels of lactate and PE
in resistance training with short recovery times (26). Al-
though lactic acid levels were not measured here, it has
been suggested that the application of vibration reduces
levels of muscular oxygenation in comparison to work car-
ried out without vibration (42), which might be associated
with increased activation of the lactic anaerobic pathway.
In conclusion, this study presents evidence that a bout
of resistance training consisting of HS with application of
WBV may produce a higher metabolic load, associated
with a higher PE, than the same training without WBV.
The result would be an increase in EE during and after
effort, and possibly an increase in the post-effort use of
substrates.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
This study indicates that subjects performing convention-
al HS training optimized energy expenditure through the
application of WBV, achieving greater metabolic stimu-
lation and greater energy expenditure. This form of ex-
ercise would not only be advantageous from an energy-
expenditure standpoint, but could also be readily included
as part of a resistance training program. This would re-
quire careful preplanning of external loads, and the col-
laboration of a multidisciplinary team. Where the aim is
to lose body fat mass, WBV programs could be combined
with other physical exercise and with dietary changes, to
favor the achievement of a negative energy balance and
to maintain or increase muscle mass.
