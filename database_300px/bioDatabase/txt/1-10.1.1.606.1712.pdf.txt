Abstract 
An efficient protocol was established for rapid and large scale propagation of woody aromatic medici-
nal plant Vitex negundo L. by in vitro shoot multiplication from shoot tips and nodal segments of mature
plant. Of the four different growth regulators BA, Kn, GA3, NAA and coconut water, MS fortified with
BA 1.0 mg/l was found to be the most effective for inducing multiple shoots from nodal explants. The
percentage (96%) of shoot multiplication per node (21.83) was highest up to second subculture pas-
sages, after which there was a gradual decline in shoot development. Best rooting was induced (93%)
in excised shoots on half strength MS medium supplemented with an optimal combination of NAA (0.3
mg/l). Soil, compost and sand (1:1:1) mixture was the most suitable planting substrate for hardening.
The survival rate was 80% and the regenerated plants were successfully transferred to the soil.

Introduction
Vitex negundo is commonly known as
'Nishinda' belongs to the family
Verbenaceae, a woody aromatic and medici-
nal shrub (Sahoo and Chand, 1998), or a
small slender tree with 3-5 foliate com-
pounds odorous leaves and bluish-purple
flowers in pedunculate-branched tomentose
cymes, grown naturally in all districts of
Bangladesh (Ghani, 2003). Its leaves contain 
a pale greenish yellow essential oil (Basu
and Singh, 1944). 
An alkaloid, nishindine (Basu and Singh,
1947) and a glucoside (Ghose and Krishna,
1936), hentriacontane, sterols, beta-sitos-
terol, beta-sitosterol acetate, sigmasterol
ascorbic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid,
carotene and amino acids have also been iso-

lated from this plant (Mukherjee and Shan,
1981; Gupta and Mukat, 1976). Stem bark
contains flavonoid glycosides of wogonin,
aurosin, vitexin, myrecetin, luteolin, leu-
codelphinidin,  leucocyanidin   rhammoside,
beta-sitosterol,  vanillic  acid  and  p-
hydroxy benjoic acid (Kodandu and
Venkata, 1977).
Leaves are antiparasitic and used as alterna-
tive vermifuge and anodyne. They are also
very effective to reduce inflammatory
swellings of joints in rheumatic attacks,
relieve catarrh and headache. Juice of fresh
leaves removes foetid discharges and worm
from ulcers. Flowers are astringent and cool-
ing, oil from flowers is applied to sinuses
and scrofulous sores. Fruits are nervine stim-
ulant, emmenagogue and vermifuge. The
root is used as tonic, febrifuge, expectorant
and diuretic. It regulates hormones, increas-
es breast-milk production and possesses
progesterogenic properties (Chevallier,
1996). 
Bangladesh has a very rich flora of medici-
nal plants. But due to heavy demand of these
plants in Pharmaceutical industries, their
supplies are getting short and as a conse-
quence of over exploitation, many important
medicinal plants are put to endangered con-
dition. In Bangladesh, no concerted effort
has yet been made for careful cultivation of
these plants so as to replenish the exhausting
supply and to conserve the threatened
species (Hossain et. al., 2000). Though the
plant has immense medicinal value it is grad-
ually declining from the nature due to over
exploitation and environmental pollution.
That is why there is an urgent need of replen-
ishment of the short supply and conservation
of this plant genetic resource. Micropro-
pagation is an effective approach to conserve
such germplasm. Further, genetic improve-
ment is another approach to augment drug-
yielding capacity of the plant. Therefore it is
important to develop an efficient microprop-
agation technique for Vitex negundo to rapid-
ly disseminate superior clones once they are
identified. Tissue culture technique can play
an important role in the clonal propagation
of elite clones and germplasm conservation
of this medicinal shrub. In recent years,
numerous studies on in vitro propagation of
different plant species have shown that this
technique may be a solution for rapid propa-
gation of selected plant species (Bonga and
Durjan, 1987; Chalupa, 1987; McCown,
1987; Boulay, 1987). The present communi-
cation deals with the development of a pro-
tocol for in vitro asexual multiplication in
Vitex negundo. 
Materials and Methods
Shoot tips and nodal explants of Vitex
negundo L. collected from the garden of
medicinal plants in the premises of BCSIR
Laboratories, Dhaka-1205, were used for
this experiment. The explants were washed
thoroughly under running tap water, pre-
soaked in liquid detergent for about 30 min,
wiped with cotton and dipped in 70% (v/v)
ethanol for 1 min. They were then surface
Afroz, Hassan, Bari, Sultana, Munshi, Jahan and Khatun 347
sterilized with 0.1% (w/v) mercuric chloride
for 5 min, followed by five rinses with ster-
ile distilled water inside a laminar air flow
cabinet. The surface sterilized explants were
sized to 1.0-1.5 cm in length containing a
single node with an axillary bud or a shoot
tip with an apical bud. The explants were
placed vertically on the culture medium.
For shoot induction agar-gelled MS
(Murashige and Skoog, 1962) basal media
supplemented with BA, Kn, GA3, coconut
water (CW) at varying concentrations were
prepared. The new shoots induced from the
in vitro cultures were further used as an
explants for adventitious shoot regeneration.
For in vitro rooting, individual shoots (3-5
cm) were cut from the proliferated shoot cul-
tures and implanted on half strength MS with
different concentrations and combinations of
NAA and IBA. All media were supplement-
ed with 30 g/l sucrose and gelled with 7 g/l
agar (Difco). Prepared media were dispensed
into 150 x15 mm culture tubes or 250 ml
conical flasks according to experiment. The
pH of the media was adjusted to 5.8 before
autoclaving at 121OC for 20 min. The cul-
tures were incubated for 16 h photoperiod at
24 ± 2OC under a fluorescent light.
Visual observation of culture was made
every week. Data on shoot induction and
proliferation and root induction were record-
ed after three weeks of inoculation and used
for calculation. For each treatment 15
explants were used and all the treatments
were repeated thrice. Data were analyzed
statistically according to Mian and Mian
(1984). The healthy plantlets were taken out
from the culture tubes, washed to make free
from agar gel with running tap water and
transplanted to plastic pots containing soil,
sand and compost (1:1:1) for hardening. The
plantlets were kept in a poly chamber at 80%
relative humidity, 32 ± 2OC under 12 h pho-
toperiod for acclimation. Established
plantlets were transplanted in earthen pots
under natural conditions and the survival
rate was recorded.   
Results and Discussion
Shoot tips and nodal explants of Vitex negun-
do were cultured on MS media supplement-
ed with various concentration of BA alone,
BA with NAA or 5% CW and Kn with GA3
for shoot induction. The explants were found
to be swollen and they produced two to five
shoots within three-four weeks after inocula-
tion (Fig 1b). The highest percentage of
shooting response of the inoculated explants
was 96%  with 21.83 shoots per culture
when the explants were cultured in MS
medium with 1.0 mg/l BA, which was fol-
lowed by the media supplemented with 1.0
mg/l BA + 5% CW, 1.5 mg/l BA, 2.0 mg/l
BA, 0.4 mg/l BA + 0.1 mg/l NAA, 0.1 mg/l
BA and 0.2 mg/l Kn + GA3 (Table I, Fig 1c,
d, e). Both the explants responded in the
same medium but the highest number of
micro shoots were found to be induced in
nodal explants. Usha et al. (2007) reported
that  maximum  shoot  proliferation (6.3) of
348 In Vitro Regeneration of Vitex negundo L., 43(3) 2008
Vitex negundo occurred when the explants
were cultured on MS medium supplemented
with 2.0 mg/l BA and 0.5 mg/l NAA than BA
alone after 4 weeks. But Sahoo and Chand
(1998) reported that the highest number of
shoots per node were six to eight during the
first three culture passages, after which there
was a gradual decline in shoot development.
In the present investigation the highest num-
bers of multiple shoots were 21.83 when cul-
tured on MS medium supplemented with 1.0
mg/l BA alone. It was also found that the
multiple shoot number was declined after
three sub cultures. Though addition of CW to
the medium increased the number of shoots
as reported by Roy et al. (1998) and Hassan
and Roy (2005) in Elaeocarpus robustus and
Gloriosa superba, respectively, in the pres-
ent investigation, addition of 5% CW in the
nutrient medium was not found to be effective
for further shoot multiplication and growth. 
About 93% rooting was observed in regener-
ated shoots of Vitex negundo when the
excised shoots were cultured individually on
half-strength MS medium supplemented
with 0.3 mg/l NAA (Table II). Roots initiat-
ed within second weeks of culture (Fig 1e).
Use of auxins singly or in combination for
rooting was also reported by different
researchers (Sahoo and Chand, 1998; Usha
et. al., 2007; Vadawale et. al., 2006; Hassan
and Roy, 2005; Rahman et al., 2006; Baksha
et al., 2007).
After four weeks the rooted shoots were
transferred to pots. None of the plantlets sur-
vived when directly transferred from rooting
medium to the pot under natural conditions.
About 80 percent of the transplanted plants
of Vitex negundo survived if the plants in the
rooting culture tubes were kept in normal
room  temperature  for  seven    days before
