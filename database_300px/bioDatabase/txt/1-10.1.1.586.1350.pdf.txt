The Effectiveness of Weighting Cell Adjustments for Longitudinal Nonresponse
Leroy Bailey
U.S. Census Bureau
Abstract
In this paper longitudinal respondents are considered
as members of a panel survey sample for whom data
are collected every wave of a given period under
consideration, and members of the panel for whom
there is nonresponse for at least one wave of the
designated period are termed longitudinal
nonrespondents.  To compensate for the effects of
wave nonresponse and attrition, the weights of
longitudinal respondents can be adjusted.  There is a
persistent need to ensure that this weight modification
is adaptable to changes in the data structure
occasioned by longitudinal nonresponse.  The paper
will discuss strategies for the selection of longitudinal
nonresponse weighting cells, examine the impact of
nonresponse weight adjustments on cross-sectional
estimates, and provide an evaluation of selected
weighting alternatives designed to account for wave
nonresponse and attrition.  Empirical results from the
1993, 1996, and 2001 panels of the Survey of Income
and Program Participation are presented for the
selected weighting cell adjustment alternatives. 
Key Words: attrition; wave nonresponse; longitudinal
weighting; logistic regression
1.  Introduction1
For many years survey practice has included the use of
weighting cell nonresponse adjustment techniques to
account for unit nonresponse. These techniques are
widely used as a result of their intuitive appeal and the
relative ease with which they can be implemented. 
Most of the applications of nonresponse weighting
cell methods require the partitioning of the sample
into homogeneous cells or groups relative to specific
population characteristics.  Such cells are also referred
to as response homogeneity groups or RHGs (Sarndal,
Swenson, and Wretman, 1992).  In longitudinal
surveys the weighting cell methodology can be
employed to compensate for the nonresponse
encountered in a given wave or round of data
collection.  Moreover, in addition to providing a rich
source of data which permit the study of the dynamic
characteristics of a population, longitudinal studies can
produce data, not available for cross-sectional surveys,
that can be used in the modeling of longitudinal
nonresponse and the development of desirable
nonresponse bias adjustment methods.   
This paper reports the major findings of a study of the
effectiveness of alternative weighting cell estimators in
accounting for longitudinal nonresponse in the Survey
of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The
following section summarizes the theoretical
framework for selected weighting schemes to adjust for
longitudinal nonresponse. The weighting cell
adjustment alternatives considered for the study are
presented in Sections 3.  Section 4  provides empirical
results for cross-sectional estimation, and concluding
remarks are offered in Section 5.
2.  Theoretical Framework for Longitudinal
Weighting
The general focus of the study is the effectiveness of
selected sample reweighting techniques in  accounting 
for wave nonresponse in estimates of descriptive
statistics for a finite population.  From the population
denoted by U ={ U1,U2,...,UN}, we select a sample s of
size n.  For survey variable y, let Yk denote the
population value for the kth unit of U, and  Bk be the
unit’s first order inclusion probability.  For the
complete response case, assuming no measurement
error, we know that  an unbiased estimator for the
population total  Ty =  is 
, the Horvitz- Thompson estimator
 (HTE).  However, in the presence wave nonresponse,
the estimator should be modified to account for the
missing data.   
 We assume that for wave t the kth population unit has
a nonzero probability Nkt of responding to the survey,
and the unbiased estimator corresponding to 
the HTE becomes  , where  sr(t) is 
the set of longitudinal respondents. Since the 
Nkt are unknown, we have to resort to modeling to
obtain a suitable reweighting estimator designed to
reduce the bias occasioned by longitudinal

nonresponse. To ensure that the sum of the final
survey weights is consistent with known population
control totals for specific auxiliary variables, a
poststratification ratio adjustment is often made at the
final stage of the reweighting process. The resultant
expression for the estimator of the total is  
                                                                                      
           ,                                     (2.1)
where   is an adjustment factor designed to
benchmark the weights to population control totals,
and  is determined by the estimation methodology
applicable to the assumed response model.
3.  Weighting Cell Adjustment Alternatives 
3.1 Modeling Response Propensity
The longitudinal nonresponse weighting cells that are
defined for survey estimation provide estimates of
response probabilities for the sample units they
comprise and reflect a response propensity model. 
For this discussion we will assume that unit level data
for various auxiliary variables are available.  We
define the response model as                       
                      Nk = Nk(x,$),                              (3.1.1) 
where x is a p-vector of response predictor variables,
and $ is the p-vector of model parameters.
The conventional nonresponse weighting cell
procedures are based on  the RHG model for which
combinations of response (nonresponse) predictor
variables divide the population and the realized
sample into mutually exclusive and exhaustive (MEE)
categories; the weighting cells correspond to the MEE
categories.  For the cth weighting cell the estimator of
the nonresponse adjustment factor 
( under the ignorable nonresponse assumption) for
each respondent of the cell is  
            (3.1.2)
where  is the inflation estimator for the size of the
cth weighting cell; sc is the set of sample cases in the
cth weighting cell; and scr is the corresponding set of
sample respondents in the cell.                                   
3.2 Selected Alternatives
The alternatives considered for this study are based on
logistic regression models, for which we assumed that
.  For the first alternative, which
will subsequently be denoted as LR, a logistic
regression model was fitted to the probability of
response to the survey, and the inverse of the estimate
of the response probability was applied directly to the 
 weights of the longitudinal respondents.  For the
second  alternative, LR/X, the longitudinal
nonresponse weighting cells were defined by the
covariates of the logistic regression model. Covariates
included such variables as education, race, geographic
region, homeowner status, and previous-wave value of
survey items.  The cells were determined by the
quintiles of the model for the third alternative (LR/Q). 
The derived  nonresponse weight adjustment for units
belonging to a given weighting cell based on the latter
two alternatives, like that for the current procedure
(CUR), is the inverse of the cell’s weighted response
rate shown in (3.1.2).  
4. Empirical Results 
4.1 Data Sources
The Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP) is a longitudinal survey conducted by the U.S.
Census Bureau.  It produces national-level estimates for
the U.S. resident population and subgroups, and has
provided the basis for studies and analysis 
of selected dynamic characteristics. 
To compensate for the potential effects of person-level
longitudinal nonresponse bias, we adjust the weights of
the SIPP longitudinal respondents -   members  of the 
survey sample for whom data are collected every
wave of the longitudinal period under consideration. 
This reweighting procedure divides the sample into
roughly 150 nonresponse weighting cells, that are
assumed  homogeneous relative to response propensity
and values of the survey variables.  The cells are
determined prior to the beginning of a SIPP panel, and
remain fixed for the duration of the panel.  Researchers
have investigated the effectiveness of this weight
modification.  See for example, Rizzo, Kalton, Brick
and Petroni (1994), Hendrick (1996) and Slud and
Bailey (2006). However, there is a persistent need to
ensure that our compensatory procedures are adaptable
to changes in the rate of longitudinal nonresponse and
that their effectiveness is not significantly diminished.
                        
The primary data sources for the study were the
1993,1996, and 2001 SIPP panels, which included 
nine, twelve, and nine waves, respectively.  The
associated  sample sizes (households)  for the three
panels were  21,823; 40,188; and 40,489.
4.2 Methodology 
In absence  of a complete set of reliable benchmarks
for the selected survey items, the evaluation of the
effectiveness of weighting cell methods in reducing
longitudinal nonresponse bias in SIPP entailed
comparing Wave 1 estimates, derived from Wave 1
respondents, with Wave 1 estimates based on
longitudinal respondents from subsequent waves,
whose weights have been adjusted for longitudinal
nonresponse.  For example, for the 2001 panel we
ASA Section on Survey Research Methods
3319
derived separate retrospective estimates for Wave 1
using longitudinally adjusted respondent data from
waves 4 and 9.  The underlying assumption for the
associated comparisons was that the Wave 1-based 
estimates were “more accurate” than those derived
from  subsequent waves, and therefore, for the
evaluation they  could serve as a standard for the
estimates from  the latter waves.
  
4.3 Results
Tables 4.3 A-C provide comparisons of Wave 1
estimates of selected SIPP totals.  Relative differences
have been computed for the estimates produced from 
the longitudinal respondents.  The survey items
selected for this presentation are AFDC (Aid to
Families with Dependent Children), food stamp
recipiency, possession of health insurance, and status
relative to unemployment and poverty.  
Our initial set of comparisons are between the original
Wave 1 estimates and the longitudinally adjusted
estimates based on the current SIPP weighting cell
nonresponse adjustment procedure (CUR).  The major
conclusion from the examination of these results is
that  SIPP item estimates may still include significant
bias after the longitudinal nonresponse adjustments are
made; moreover, in general the effects of longitudinal
nonresponse on 
SIPP estimates are seemingly exacerbated as time-in-
sample is increased. The data shown in these tables 
are for item totals.  The magnitude of the  “measures of
error” is generally expected to be larger for other
domains of interest.  
Ostensibly, concurrent with increasing attrition,  we have 
indications of  a response mechanism that could
potentially result in nonresponse bias not accounted for
by the current SIPP longitudinal nonresponse adjustment
methodology. 
Tables 4.3 A-C also permit a comparison of SIPP  
estimates based on the current  nonresponse weighting
cell adjustment methodology (CUR) with estimates from
the three other weighting alternatives identified earlier.
The general form of the estimators from which the
estimates of the tables  are derived is given in equation
2.1.  Differences in the four alternative estimators
essentially result from the different estimators of Nkt, the
responsepropensity for the kth unit at Wave t, for the
varied response models considered. Equation 2.1 is also
the general form of the estimator associated with the
Wave 1- based estimates, the standard for the
comparisons.  However, for the estimator for the
population total at Wave 1, denoted by 
                   , (4.3.1)   
 is a Wave 1 household nonresponse adjustment. 
For Wave t, t$2,  can be represented as the product
of the Wave 1 household nonresponse adjustment and
the person-level nonresponse adjustment for the
applicable wave.

Results varied by panel, wave, and survey item.  In
many cases the estimates derived from the current
weighting cell procedure and the corresponding
estimates based on the alternative methods are not
statistically different from each other nor form the
Wave 1 standard.  However, the table entries
suggest that for the items selected for this study,
there is a persistent potential for  the introduction
of bias in the estimation through the application of
the current  adjustment methodology.  
Of the 30 comparisons between the original Wave
1 estimated totals and the corresponding CUR
estimates for the selected SIPP items, 18 of the
related differences were statistically significant, as
denoted by the highlighted table entries. Moreover,
for many of these comparisons there were model-
based weighting alternatives to the CUR estimates
that appeared to have performed better.  For
example, for the Wave 9 respondents of the 1993
panel the estimated relative difference for poverty
is -3.03% for the CUR procedure.  This is compared to
estimates of 0.46 and 0.67 for the LR and LR/X
weighting alternatives.  For the Wave 12 respondents of
the 1996 panel, the CUR’s relative difference for food
stamps is -1.57%, which can be compared to the  -0.13 
associated with the LR/X procedure.  Note also that for
the Wave 12 respondents of the 1996 panel the relative
difference for unemployed for the CUR method is -
5.62%, for which the corresponding estimate for the
LR/X  approach is  -0.30%. For the 2001 panel the
CUR Wave 9 respondents’ estimated relative difference
for food stamps was 2.63%.  The corresponding
estimate for the LR model alternative was 0.34 percent.

There were indications of potentially significant
longitudinal nonresponse bias in estimates for the
poverty and health insurance items more frequently
than for the other items  considered.  However, in
most cases, the alternative estimates for health
insurance were not statistically different from the
current estimates.  
Comparisons were also made, for the race and
ethnicity domains, of estimates resulting from the
current longitudinal noresponse adjustment with
estimates for the selected adjustment alternatives.
However, in the interest of conserving space the
related tables are not provided in this report. 
Patterns for the estimates of nonresponse related
error were less evident for these groups than those
exhibited in the estimates for the item totals.  For
these domains there appears to be more items with a
potential for significant longitudinal nonresponse
bias; moreover the magnitude of these biases are
expected to be somewhat larger than those of the
item totals.  The results were rather mixed and
varied by domain and panel.  Results of the
comparisons for the White and Black subgroups
varied considerably among the three panels, while
results for the Other Races domain seem to suggest
a strong potential for longitudinal nonresponse bias
for almost all of the selected items.   The empirical
results for the Hispanic subgroup provided more
frequent indications of the preference for the current
nonresponse reweighting procedure.   
   
5.  Discussion
The increased rate of wave nonresponse and
attrition in the Survey of Income and Program
Participation, and the potential for significant
related bias in the estimates for the principal survey
items, appear to warrant a continued effort to
develop and maintain a longitudinal weight
adjustment procedure designed to compensate for
nonresponse.  The results of the study summarized
in this paper provide some insight into the possible
extent of nonresponse related error in SIPP
estimation, and  they permitted some comparisons
of plausible response modeling and weighting cell
adjustment alternatives.   Based on the current 
evaluation criteria, there is seemingly no single
nonresponse  weighting cell scheme that 
is uniformly “better” than the other alternatives
considered. However, the results from the application
of some of the methodology explored in the study for
item totals are encouraging.  Weighting cell adjustment
procedures, that take advantage of the utility of the
historical (previous wave) survey data in the definition
of the applicable model, and consequently the
nonresponse weight adjustment cells, should warrant
strong consideration in the effort to compensate for
longitudinal nonresponse.  
It is desirable to use longitudinal surveys such as SIPP
to study the dynamics of populations and economic
phenomena.  The study of event histories, spells or
durations and transistions provide planners and
policymakers with data and relevant results crucial to
the development, maintenance and evaluation of major
state and national programs.  As with the cross
sectional estimates, longitudinal nonresponse can have
a substantial impact on the quality of derived
longitudinal estimates or measures.  Another objective
of the study of longitudinal nonresponse in SIPP is to
investigate its effects and those of related adjustments
on longitudinal modeling and estimation. Research is
under way, which is designed to identify the theoretical
framework and develop valid empirical methods for
assessing the relationships between longitudinal
nonresponse and duration models for SIPP program
participation.  
 Anticipated future work in this area  includes  the study
of  the effectiveness of a class of distance measures as a
tool for comparing alternative weighting  strategies and
the selection of a highly efficient set of nonresponse
weighting cells. In addition, efforts will also examine
the effect of adjustments for longitudinal nonresponse
on duration estimation, survival functions and other
event history analyses of  SIPP data.
