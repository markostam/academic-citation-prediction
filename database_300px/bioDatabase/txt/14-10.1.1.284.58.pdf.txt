ABSTRACT
Intramolecular G-quadruplexes formed by human
telomere sequences are attractive anticancer
targets. Recently, four-repeat human telomere
sequences have been shown to form two different
intramolecular (3 + 1) G-quadruplexes in K+ solution
(Form 1 and Form 2). Here we report on the solution
structures of both Form 1 and Form 2 adopted by
natural human telomere sequences. Both structures
contain the (3 +1) G-tetrad core with one double-
chain-reversal and two edgewise loops, but differ
in the successive order of loop arrangements within
the G-quadruplex scaffold. Our results provide the
structural details at the two ends of the G-tetrad
core in the context of natural sequences and
information on different loop conformations.
This structural information might be important
for our understanding of telomere G-quadruplex
structures and for anticancer drug design targeted
to such scaffolds.
INTRODUCTION
Guanine-rich DNA sequences can form G-quadruplex
structures in vitro through stacking of planar GGGG
tetrads (1–5). DNA at the ends (telomeres) of eukaryotic
chromosomes consists of tandem repeats of G-rich se-
quences, such as (GGGTTA)n in humans (6). The in vitro
(7,8) and in vivo (9–11) observations of G-quadruplex
formation in telomeric sequences and telomeres, respec-
tively, show the biological importance of this DNA
scaﬀold. G-quadruplexes formed by human telomere
sequences are promising anticancer targets (12–16),
because formation of such structures inhibits the activity
of telomerase (17–19), an enzyme (20) that is required for
the proliferation of 80%–85% of cancer cells (21).
In 1993, our group characterized the ﬁrst NMR-based
solution structure of a four-repeat human telomere
sequence, d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] in Na
+ solution (7).
This sequence forms an intramolecular G-quadruplex
involving three stacked G-tetrads with antiantisynsyn
glycosidic conformations around each tetrad. Three
connecting TTA loops adopt successive edgewise, diagonal
and edgewise alignments, such that each strand has both
parallel and antiparallel adjacent strands (Figure 1A).
In 2002, a very diﬀerent G-quadruplex structure of the
same sequence was observed in a K+-containing crystal by
the Stephen Neidle group (8). In this structure, all four
strands are parallel, the connecting TTA loops are double-
chain-reversal, and all guanines adopt anti glycosidic
conformations (Figure 1B). Subsequent studies from
many laboratories indicated the presence of a mixture of
multiple G-quadruplex forms for human telomere
sequences in physiological K+ solution conditions (22–40).
In 2005, our group showed that three-repeat human
telomere sequences form a bimolecular (3+1) quadruplex
in Na+ solution, whose core contains three strands
oriented in one direction and the fourth in the opposite
direction (41). This type of (3+1) G-quadruplex core was
ﬁrst reported by our group in 1994 for a Tetrahymena
telomere G-quadruplex (42). In 2006, our group showed
that four-repeat human telomere sequences form at least
two intramolecular G-quadruplexes of the (3+1)-type
(Form 1 and Form 2) in K+ solution (43,44). Form 1
(Figure 1C) and Form 2 (Figure 1D) are the major
conformations (70%) of the natural human telomere
23-nt d[TAGGG(TTAGGG)3] and 25-nt d[TAGGG(TTA
GGG)3TT] sequences in K
+ solution, respectively (43,44).
Both forms contain one double-chain-reversal and two

edgewise loops, but they diﬀer in the successive order of
loop arrangements: the double-chain-reversal loop is
formed by the third TTA linker in Form 2 (Figure 1D)
instead of the ﬁrst TTA linker in Form 1 (Figure 1C).
Formation of Form 1 human telomere quadruplex was
independently proposed by two other research groups
using end-modiﬁed (45) and multiple 8-bromoguanine-
substituted (46) sequences, respectively. It appeared that
some modiﬁcations at terminal residues favor certain loop
conformations of the quadruplex due to their interaction
with the loop residues (43–45), while multiple guanine-to-
8-bromoguanine (G! BrG) substitutions would favor
a quadruplex form, in which the substituted guanines
are forced to adopt syn conformations (46–48).
By slightly modifying some ﬂanking terminal residues,
we could favor Form 1 (to 95%) and determine its
solution structure (43). Although this structure provided
the ﬁrst approximation to the 3D structure of an intr-
amolecular human telomere G-quadruplex in K+ solution
(49), some structural information could be altered by in-
corporated modiﬁed bases at the ends of the molecule (43).
Very recently, structures of Form 1 were also reported by
Dai et al. (50) for a diﬀerent end-modiﬁed sequence and
by Matsugami et al. (51) for a sequence containing ﬁve
BrG substitutions.
Here we report on the NMR-based solution structures
of both Form 1 and Form 2 quadruplexes adopted by
natural human telomere sequences. The structure deter-
mination was assisted by the study of sequences each
containing judiciously chosen single BrG substitution
(see below). Our results provide the structural details at
the two ends of the G-tetrad core in the context of natural
sequences and information on the range of conformations
accessible to the TAA loops. This structural information
might be important for the design of anticancer drugs
targeted to human telomeric DNA.
METHODS
Sample preparation
The unlabeled and the site-speciﬁc low-enrichment (2%
15N-labeled) oligonucleotides were synthesized and puri-
ﬁed as described previously (52,53). Unless otherwise
stated, the strand concentration of the NMR samples was
typically 0.5–5mM; the solutions contained 70mM of
KCl and 20mM of potassium phosphate (pH 7).
Sequences used in this work are shown below:

NMR spectroscopy
Experiments were performed on 600MHz spectrometers
at 258C, unless otherwise speciﬁed. Resonances for
G residues were assigned unambiguously by using site-
speciﬁc low-enrichment labeling and through-bond corre-
lations at natural abundance (52–55). Resonances for
T residues were assigned following systematic T-to-U
replacements. Assignments of resonances for A residues
were obtained from NOE connectivities with neighboring
T and G residues in the fold. NMR spectral assignments
were completed by through-bond (COSY, TOCSY) and
through-space (NOESY) correlation experiments as
described previously (54). Interproton distances were
measured by using NOESY experiments at diﬀerent
mixing times.
Structure calculation
The structures of Form 1 and Form 2 human telomere
quadruplexes were calculated using the X-PLOR program
(56). NMR-restrained molecular dynamics computations
were performed as described previously (43). The struc-
tures were ﬁrst calculated for BrG-substituted sequences.
Inclusion of K+ ions within the top and bottom caps of
Form 2 (57) resulted in well-converged structures, which
are consistent with experimental data. The ensembles of
structures for natural sequences were computed from
those for BrG-substituted sequences by reﬁning them
against the experimental restraints obtained for natural
sequences.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effects of DNA sequences on relative quadruplex populations
and quality of NMR spectra
Previously, we systematically examined human telomere
sequences containing four G-tracts and showed that small
changes to ﬂanking sequences can perturb the equilibrium
between diﬀerent coexisting G-quadruplex forms (44).
In K+ solution, d[TAGGG(TTAGGG)3] (a natural
human telomere sequence) forms up to 70% of Form 1
(43), while d[TAGGG(TTAGGG)3TT] (also a natural
human telomere sequence) with two Ts at 30-end forms up
to 70% of Form 2 (44). Here we will call these sequences
natural-Form 1 and natural-Form 2, respectively.
It should be noted that two G-quadruplex conformers
coexist in slow exchange at comparable proportions in
d[TAGGG(TTA GGG)3T] (another natural human telo-
mere sequence) having one T at 30-end (Figure S1,
Supplementary Data).
Substitution of proton by bromine at position C8 of
a guanine has been shown to favor syn glycosidic
conformation of the nucleotide (47). When all ﬁve
guanines that adopted syn conformations in Form 1
were substituted by 8-bromoguanines, Form 1 predomi-
nated (46,51). However, each G-to-BrG substitution
removes a proton (useful in NMR studies). For the
natural-Form 1 and natural-Form 2 sequences, we could
identify single G-to-BrG substitutions (at position G16
and G15, respectively) that further favored the corres-
ponding major form, thereby signiﬁcantly improving
NMR spectra (Figure 2). They will be called BrG16-
Form 1 and BrG15-Form 2, respectively.
NMR spectral assignments
We have previously unambiguously assigned imino and
H8 protons of guanines in natural sequences (43,44).
Corresponding assignments for single BrG-substituted
sequences could be obtained by comparing spectral
patterns of the modiﬁed and natural sequences
(Figures 2 and 3). These assignments were also indepen-
dently conﬁrmed by some low-enrichment site-speciﬁc
labeling and natural abundance through-bond correlation
experiments (Figure 4) (52–55). Assignments of reso-
nances for T residues were obtained from T-to-U
substitution samples (54). NMR spectral assignments
were completed by through-bond (COSY, TOCSY) and
through-space (NOESY) correlation experiments as
described previously (54).
We ﬁrst assigned most peaks in NOESY spectra of
BrG-substituted sequences. These NOE assignments
helped us to assign NOEs for the natural sequences,
which would have been very diﬃcult to complete due to
the presence of a signiﬁcant amount of minor
conformation(s).
Analysis of NOE patterns (Figure 3) suggested that the
major forms of BrG-substituted sequences and those of the
corresponding natural sequences are of the same general
folds (Figure 1). The Form 1 and Form 2 folds for
BrG-substituted sequences were supported by proton
exchange data, which showed that imino protons of the
central G-tetrad are the most protected from exchange
with water (Figure 4).
Overall solution structure
The structures of Form 1 (Figures 5, 6 and S2, Table 1)
and Form 2 (Figures 7, 8 and S3, Table 2) human telomere
quadruplexes adopted by BrG-substituted and natural
sequences were calculated on the basis of NMR restraints

using the X-PLOR program (56). In all cases, the structure
of the G-tetrad cores is better deﬁned than that of the
loops (Figures 5 and 7). The structures formed by the
BrG-substituted and the corresponding natural sequences
are quite similar. However, the structures calculated for
the BrG-substituted sequences (Figures 5A and 7A) are
slightly better deﬁned than those calculated for the natural
sequences (Figures 5C and 7C) thanks to larger numbers
of deﬁned NOE peaks associated with cleaner NMR
spectra.
Both Form 1 and Form 2 contain the (3+1)
G-quadruplex core, which is identiﬁed by one narrow, one
wide and two medium grooves (Figure 1C and D) (41–43).
The groove widths are deﬁned mainly by the relative
orientations of strands, but are also somewhat aﬀected by
the structures of the closing loops. For example, the narrow
groove seems narrower in Form 2 than in Form 1
(Figures 5B and 7B, respectively). These grooves could
serve as potential targets for small-molecule ligands.
Structure of loops and caps
In both Form 1 and Form 2, there are one double-chain-
reversal and two edgewise TTA loops. The double-chain-
reversal loop is situated in a medium groove. The edgewise
loops always connect an anti guanine to a syn guanine,
across narrow or wide grooves; they cap the top and the
bottom of the G-tetrad core, respectively (Figure 1). The
detailed structures of these elements in Form 1 and Form
2 are shown in Figures 6 and 8, respectively. Figures S2
and S3 show the distribution of sequential and long-range
NOEs used to derive the loop structures in these forms.
In Form 1, the T18–T19–A20 loop (Figure 6A) closes
a narrow groove and caps the top of the G-tetrad core.
Residue A20 from this loop is aligned with residues T1
and A2 from the 50-end to form the (T1–A2) A20 triad
platform (Figure 6A and D). Residue T19 is stacked
on top of this platform, while T18 is projected aside.
An adenine triple was observed by Dai et al. (50) in the top
cap of Form 1 for an end-modiﬁed sequence, in which the
natural residue T1 was replaced by an A. This base triple
involved adenines which are equivalent to A2, A8 and A20
in our sequence. Such an adenine triple does not form in
our structure of the natural human telomere sequence.
The T12–T13–A14 loop (Figure 6C) closes a wide groove
and caps the bottom of the G-tetrad core. Hoogsteen base
pair A14–T12 was observed among computed structures
and stacks over the terminal G-tetrad (Figures 5 and 6C).
This conﬁguration of the bottom loop is clearly diﬀerent
from that observed for Form 1 with modiﬁed bases at the
30-end (43,50). The structure of the T6–T7–A8 double-
chain-reversal loop shows the stacking between T7 and A8
(Figure 6B). We observe diﬀerences in the conformations
of both edgewise TTA loops between our Form 1 solution
structure (Figures 6A and C) and the corresponding
solution structure reported by Matsugami et al. (51).
In our case, there is much greater stacking of the loop
residues over the terminal G-tetrads.
In Form 2, the T12–T13–A14 loop (Figure 8A) closes
a narrow groove and caps the top of the G-tetrad core.
The residues in this loop interact intimately with the
50-end residues T1–A2 (Figure 8A and D). NOEs detected
within this region are consistent with a structure where T1,
T12 and A14 residues, together with the carbonyl groups
of the top G-tetrad, can potentially coordinate a K+ ion
within the loop (Figure S4). This structure would explain
the upﬁeld chemical shifts of many protons of T1

(Figure 3 and Table S2). However, other structures might
also be possible for this region, as manifested by the
broadening of some resonances at 258C (44). For example,
in some stages of computation we observed the interaction
of A20 from the double-chain-reversal loop with residues
in the top cap. The structure of the T18–T19–A20 double-
chain-reversal loop shows some stacking between T18 and
T19 bases (Figure 8B). The T6–T7–A8 loop (Figure 8C)
closes a wide groove and caps the bottom of the G-tetrad
core. Residues T7 and A8 interact with T24 from the
30-end to form a (T7–A8) T24 triad platform. Residue
T25 is stacked below this platform. The conﬁguration of
the bottom cap in Form 2 involving the interaction
between the loop and the 30-end residues is quite diﬀerent
from that observed in Form 1 [see above and Refs.
(43,50,51)]. A K+ ion can also be potentially coordinated
between the bottom G-tetrad and the cap (Figure S4).
In general, K+ can be coordinated within all edgewise
loops presented here, and the equilibrium between base
pairings and K+ coordination is probably the best

tions reinforce a previous proposal by our group of K+
cation coordination within edgewise loops in G-quad-
ruplexes (57).
Structure of TTA loops in telomere quadruplexes
Four-repeat human telomere sequences can form at least
two diﬀerent intramolecular (3+1) G-quadruplexes in
K+ solution. These structures can coexist and be in
dynamic equilibrium with other G-quadruplex forms.
Such an equilibrium between conformers is reminiscent of
what was reported previously by our group for two-repeat
human telomere (22) and two-repeat Tetrahymena telo-
mere (53) G-quadruplexes in solution. As all possible

human telomere G-quadruplexes might contain TTA
loops, it is important to gather structural patterns of
diﬀerent TTA loop conformations. We have obtained
from this work several diﬀerent conﬁgurations of TTA
loops in the context of G-quadruplexes formed by natural
sequences. Generally, the bases of edgewise loops tend to
maximize pairing by forming non-canonical pairs, triples
and triads, which in turn stack over the terminal
G-tetrads. In favorable cases, edgewise loop residues
could also align to potentially coordinate a K+ cation,
embedded within the loop turn. A range of topologies
have been observed for TTA double-chain-reversal loops,
with a common theme that two out of the three bases
generally tend to stack on each other. Note that even
though the present structures were solved for natural
human telomere sequences, sequence extension towards
either 50- or 30-ends can aﬀect the structure of the loops
and caps (44). It should also be noted that the presence of
a ligand may push the equilibrium towards one particular
structure, which may or may not be represented by the
free native sequence (58).
CONCLUSION
We have determined the structures of Form 1 and Form 2
intramolecular (3+1) G-quadruplexes adopted by nat-
ural human telomere sequences in K+ solution in the

presence of up to 30% of minor conformations. Both
structures contain the (3+1) G-tetrad core with one
double-chain-reversal and two edgewise loops, but diﬀer
in the successive order of loop appearance within the
G-quadruplex scaﬀold. Our results provide the structural
details at the two ends of the G-tetrad core in the context
of natural sequences and context-dependent information
on edgewise and double-chain-reversal loop conforma-
tions. Comparison between diﬀerent TTA loop conforma-
tions has revealed structural patterns, which are likely to
recur within the family of G-quadruplex structures
adopted by human telomere sequences.
NOTE
A paper on the NMR-based solution structure of Form 2
human telomere G-quadruplex for the sequence
d[TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTT] appeared
online (coordinates are currently on hold) during the review
of our paper. This sequence contains an additional T at the
50-end compared to our Form 2 sequence (Dai,J.,
