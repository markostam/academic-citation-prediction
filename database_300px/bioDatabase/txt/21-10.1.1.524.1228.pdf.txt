ABSTRACT
The formation of G-quadruplex and i-motif structures
in the 50 end of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene was
examined using chemical modifications, circular
dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. It
was found that substitutions of 8-methylguanine at
positions that show syn conformations in antiparallel
G-quadruplexes stabilize the structure in the G-rich
strand. The complementary C-rich 18mer forms an
i-motif structure, as suggested by CD spectroscopy.
Based on the C to T mutation experiments, C bases
participated in the C–C+ base pair of the i-motif struc-
ture were determined. Experiments of 2-aminopurine
(2-AP) substitution reveal that an increase of
fluorescence in the G-quadruplex relative to duplex
is attributed to unstacked 2-AP within the loop of
G-quadruplex. The fluorescence experiments sug-
gest that formation of the G-quadruplex and i-motif
can compete with duplex formation. Furthermore, a
polymerase arrest assay indicated that formation the
G-quadruplex structure in the Rb gene acts as a bar-
rier in DNA synthesis.
INTRODUCTION
The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene encodes a nuclear phosphopro-
tein that acts as a tumor suppressor by affecting the cell cycle
(1,2). The Rb/E2F pathway, regulating the E2F transcription
factor (1,2), is critical in regulating the initiation of DNA
replication, and the control of this pathway is disrupted in
virtually all human cancers (2). Examination of the Rb
gene sequences reveals that regions at the 50 termini are
extremely rich in G and C residues (Figure 1) (3,4). G-rich
sequences have been proposed to have important biological
roles through the formation of G-quadruplex structures (5–10).
For example, telomeric DNA is fundamental in protecting the
cell from recombination and degradation through the forma-
tion of G-quadruplex structures (11). It has been demonstrated
that a G-quadruplex structure formed in the c-myc promoter
region functions as a transcriptional repressor element (12).
We recently demonstrated, using a photochemical method,
that the sequence d(CGGGGGGTTTTGGGCGGC) (ODN 1)
at the 50 terminus of the Rb gene can form an antiparallel G-
quadruplex (13).
It is well known that C-rich DNA strands adopt an i-motif
structure, whose building block is hemiprotonated C-C+-base
pairs at slightly acidic pH (14). Sequences with the potential to
form i-motifs are frequent in the human genome, as exempli-
fied by its presence in the regulatory region of myeloid specific
genes and human c-ki-ras (15,16). However, the C-rich strand
from the Rb gene has received relatively less attention.
Here, we propose the formation of G-quadruplex and
i-motif structures at the 50 end of Rb gene, examined by chem-
ical modifications, circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence
spectroscopy experiments. One possible biologically relevant
role for the G-quartet is control of DNA synthesis. This hypo-
thesis was tested using a rapid and simple polymerase arrest
assay carried out in physiological salt conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides containing 8-methylguanine (m8G) were
prepared by the phosphoramidite method on controlled pore
glass supports (1 mmol) using a Beckman OLIGO1000
and Applied Biosystems 3400 DNA synthesizer (17,18).
After automated synthesis, the oligomers were detached from
Figure 1. Structure of the human retinoblastoma gene. The inset shows the

the support, deprotected and purified by high-performance
liquid chromatography. The oligomers were identified by
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Perkin Elmer
SCIEX API 165 mass spectrometer (negative mode). The purity
and concentrations of these oligomers were determined by
complete digestion of the oligomers with alkaline phosphatase
and P1 nuclease to 20-deoxymononucleosides.
CD measurements and analysis of CD melting profiles
CD spectra were measured using an AVIV MODEL 62 DS/
202 CD spectrophotometer. CD spectra were recorded using a
1 cm path-length cell. In CD melting studies, diluted samples
were equilibrated at room temperature for several hours to
obtain equilibrium spectra. Solutions for CD spectra were
prepared as 1 ml samples at 0.1 mM (base concentration)
in the presence of 100 mM KCl at 25C. The sample pH
was adjusted for each experiment with HCl and KOH, and
using a glass microelectrode.
Fluorescence measurements
The fluorescence spectra were measured using a JASCO
FP-6300 spectrofluorometer. The samples were excited at
317 nm and the fluorescence emission spectra were collected
in the wavelength range 335–500 nm. Solutions for fluores-
cence spectra were prepared as 1 ml samples at 0.1 mM (base
concentration) in the presence of 100 mM KCl at 25C. In the
G-quartet to duplex experiments, 1.5 equiv. of the cytosine-
rich complementary strand and TMPyP was added.

(pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1.5
mg/ml BSA] with 0.1 mM dNTP by heating to 95C and slow
cooling to room temperature. Taq DNA polymerase (5 U) was
added and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at different
temperatures. The polymerase extension was stopped by
adding two times stop buffer [10 mM EDTA, 10 mM
NaOH, 0.1% xylene cyanole and 0.1% bromophenol blue in
formamide solution], and the solution was loaded onto a 12%
denaturing polyacrylamide gel.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structure characterization of G-rich sequence
The chemical and biochemical properties of G-quadruplexes
could be better understood by controlling G-quartet-folding
topologies in a specified manner (19–22). The G-rich strand
may adopt a G-quartet structure depending on the orientation
of the strands and the syn/anti conformations of guanines (23–
29). In anti-parallel G-quadruplex structures, G residues adapt
syn/anti conformations around individual G-tetrads (23–29).
For example, analogous determination of the arrangement of
anti/syn conformations of the G residues by using 8-
bromoguanine substituted G-quadruplexes has been reported
(19). Based on NMR analysis, we have demonstrated that m8G
adopts a syn conformation (Figure 2) (18). It is reasonable to
believe that substitutions of m8G at positions that show syn
conformations in antiparallel G-quadruplexes might stabilize
the structure, whereas substitution at positions required to be
anti might destabilize the structures. Based on the efficient
deoxyribonolactone formation by the uracil-5-yl radical in the
diagonal loop, we recently proposed that the G-rich sequence
ODN 1 at the 50 end of the Rb gene forms an antiparallel G-
quadruplex (13). To understand the syn/anti conformations of
guanine in the antiparallel G-quadruplex of the Rb gene, the
thermal stability of the G-quadruplex formed by ODN 1 with
specifically positioned m8G residues were examined using CD
melting experiments. Substitution at the first dG of each GG
step results in an increase in stability. The melting temperature
(Tm) values of ODN 2, ODN 4, ODN 5 and ODN 6 were
increased by 3–5C, whereas substitution at the second dG
of GG step results in a decrease in stability (ODN 3) (Table 1
and Supplementary Figure 1S). The m8G substitution at syn
positions in the antiparallel G-quadruplex contributes to redu-
cing the energetic penalty for folding, whereas the substitution
at anti positions results in an energetic penalty for flipping the
base from syn to anti. The CD spectra of each oligonucleotide
exhibit a positive band at 295 nm and a negative band around
265 nm in the presence of 100 mM K+ ions, which is char-
acteristic of an antiparallel G-quadruplex structure (Supple-
mentary Figure 2S). Based on the predicted effect of m8G,
these results suggest that the guanine syn/anti patterns are
along individual strands and around individual G-tetrads in
the antiparallel structure (Figure 3).

To further understand the molecular basis of the structure,
quadruplex-to-duplex conversion was monitored through
changes in fluorescence intensity of 2-aminopurine (2-AP),
a highly structure-sensitive fluorescent probe, which was
incorporated into the loop of the G-quadruplex. An important
observation was that the fluorescence intensity of the quad-
ruplex was 10 times higher than that of the duplex (Figure 4).
Disrupting the G-quadruplex by hybridization of a cytosine-
rich complementary strand to the quadruplex resulted in a
marked decrease in fluorescence intensity. The reduction is
attributed to different stacking interactions of the nucleobases
in the quadruplex and duplex structures (30,31). In the quad-
ruplex, the nucleobase segment in the loop is highly distorted
and p-stacking is disrupted. The short decay time observed for
2-AP in a duplex is attributed to the fully stacked state,
whereas longer lifetimes come from unstacked 2-AP in the
G-quadruplex (30).
In theory, the structures we have described could form
in vivo any time that the duplex region containing the sequence
becomes unpaired. Replication or transcription would
provide such an opportunity, allowing the G-quadruplex to
form upon exposure of the single-stranded G-rich region.
The Rb sequence, which contains a G-rich segment, might
block DNA synthesis by forming such a G-quadruplex that
is sufficient to impede progress of the polymerase. To test this
possibility, we studied the ability of the G-quadruplex to
arrest DNA synthesis. A 66mer DNA template containing
the ODN 1 sequence was incubated in the presence of Taq
DNA polymerase with a primer with a complementary
sequence to the 30 end of the 66mer template. The principle
of the assay is shown to the left of the gel in Figure 5. If
complex extension of the primer occurs, a full-length
66mer product is formed. However, factors that promote
and stabilize G-quadruplex formation will lead to a specific
pause site on the template, resulting in the formation of a
truncated 34mer product. The polymerase primer extension

reactions were carried out at three different temperatures. A
significant pause is observed for primer extension under
physiological salt conditions at 37C, and there is less
34mer product with increasing temperature. The polymerase
pausing is less apparent at 77C, which is higher than the
melting point of the G-quadruplex structure formed in this
G-rich region of the template DNA. To further confirm that
the pause results from the formation of a G-quadruplex struc-
ture in the template DNA, a mutated template DNA that con-
tains the G to A mutations G2, G6, G12 and G16 within
individual G-tetrads was used in a parallel experiment. The
primer extension results with the mutated template indicate
that no significant pause occurs at all three temperatures tested.
The results suggest that an intramolecular G-quadruplex can
be formed in the G-rich region of the Rb gene, leading to
pronounced DNA synthesis arrest in the original G-rich tem-
plate. Non-B DNA conformations were also associated with
genomic rearrangement breakpoints (32,33), and such a G-
quadruplex element in Rb gene could contribute to double-
strand breaks, resulting in destabilization of the gene.
Structure characterization of C-rich sequence
C-rich strands are known to fold into i-motif structures with
hemiprotonated C-C+-base pairs in acidic conditions (34,35).
To investigate whether the i-motif structure was formed by the
C-rich complementary strand of the 50 end of the Rb gene, CD
spectra of ODN 7 were measured at pHs ranging from 4.0 to
8.0 (Figure 6a). For the C-rich strand, measurement at
pH < 5.5 revealed a maximum at 285–290 nm, which is char-
acteristic of i-motif structures (36,37). At pH > 7, the max-
imum shifted towards 275 nm, consistent with the unstructured
signal-strand DNA. A pH profile plotted by measuring changes
in CD Cotton effect of the positive band at 287 nm shows
conformational integrity in the range pH 4.0–5.5, further
increases in pH resulted in unfolding to a single strand. A
transition mid-point at pH 5.9 ± 0.2 was determined from
this plot (Figure 6a, inset). To identify further the nature of
the i-motif structure, five different C-to-T mutations in ODN 7
were designed and prepared (Figure 6b). If these Cs are not
involved in the C–C+ base pairs, then mutation to T should not
significantly affect i-motif stabilization. CD experiments
showed that C5, C14 and C15 are not required for formation
of a stable i-motif structure. However, C7 is clearly critical
for i-motif stability, showing a decrease in CD intensity at
287 nm. Based on these results, two types of i-motif structures
can be formed by the four C–C+ intercalated units, as shown
in Figure 7. Our observations suggest the possibility of the
formation of intramolecular i-motif in the Rb sequence.
Although acidic pH favors the formation of i-motif structures
and there is no conclusive proof that they exist in vivo, the
potential sequences to form i-motifs are frequent in the human
genome. To date, i-motif structures have been proposed to
form in both centromeric and telomeric regions of human
chromosomes, as well as in the promoter region of the
human c-myc gene (38–41).
To further understand the molecular basis of the i-motif
structure, the fluorescence intensity of 2-AP at the loop of
i-motif was investigated. A marked increase in fluorescence
intensity in i-motif compared with duplex was observed
(Figure 6c). The different stacking interactions of the

nucleobases in the i-motif and duplex structures may be attrib-
uted to the differences of fluorescence. It is similar to the
observation on G-quadruplex and duplex.
To elucidate the effect of i-motif and G-quadruplex struc-
ture on quadruplex-to-duplex conversion, the ratio of duplex
formation was examined by fluorescence experiments. We
found that quadruplex-to-duplex conversion occurs more
slowly at lower pH conditions in comparison with neutral
pH (Figure 8). It is believed that low pH stabilizes the folded
i-motif structure of the C-rich strand, thus providing a
competitor for duplex formation relative to the linear C-rich
strand at neutral pH, that results in slow hybridization occur-
ring and the formation of duplex (34,42). Furthermore, when
the G-quartet-binding ligand TMPyP was added to the 2-AP-
contaning 18mer solution, almost no fluorescence change was
observed. This suggests that TMPyP stabilizes the G-quad-
ruplex structure and prevents the duplex formation reaction.
In conclusion, we found that methylation of dG at positions
that exist in syn conformations in antiparallel G-quartets can
stabilize the quadruplex structure in the G-rich strand of Rb
gene. The quadruplex-to-duplex conformational change was
monitored using the structure-sensitive fluorescence probe
2-AP. Importantly, we found that formation of such a
G-quadruplex in the Rb gene impedes the progress of DNA
polymerase, indicating a possible biological role for the
quadruplex structure in Rb gene. Our experiments suggest
that i-motif formation occurs in the C-rich complementary
strand in vitro. Although the double-helix form was predom-
inant at neutral pH, the G-quadruplex and i-motif efficiently
competed with the duplex at lower pH values. These results
suggest that the G-strand and the C-strand at the 50 terminus of
Rb gene are capable of forming the G-quadruplex and i-motif
structures in vitro.
