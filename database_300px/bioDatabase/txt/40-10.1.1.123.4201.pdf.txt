ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs
of 22 nt. Although hundreds of miRNAs have been
identified through experimental complementary
DNA cloning methods and computational efforts,
previous approaches could detect only abundantly
expressed miRNAs or close homologs of previously
identified miRNAs. Here, we introduce a probabilistic
co-learning model for miRNA gene finding, ProMiR,
which simultaneously considers the structure and
sequence of miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). On 5-
fold cross-validation with 136 referenced human data-
sets, the efficiency of the classification shows 73%
sensitivity and 96% specificity. When applied to gen-
ome screening for novel miRNAs on human chromo-
somes 16, 17, 18 and 19, ProMiR effectively searches
distantly homologous patterns over diverse pre-
miRNAs, detecting at least 23 novel miRNA gene can-
didates. Importantly, the miRNA gene candidates do
not demonstrate clear sequence similarity to the
known miRNA genes. By quantitative PCR followed
by RNA interference against Drosha, we experiment-
allyconfirmedthat9of the23representativecandidate
genes express transcripts that are processed by the
miRNAbiogenesisenzymeDroshainHeLacells, indic-
ating that ProMiR may successfully predict miRNA
genes with at least 40% accuracy. Our study suggests

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), constituting a large family of noncod-
ing (nc) small RNAs, directly take part in post-transcriptional
regulation either by arresting the translation of messenger
RNAs (mRNAs) or by the cleavage of mRNAs (1). miRNAs
are defined as single-stranded RNAs of 22 nt in length
(ranged 19–25 nt) generated from endogenous transcripts
that can form local hairpin structures (2). miRNA genes are
transcribed by RNA polymerase II (3,4). The local hairpin
structures in the primary transcripts [primary microRNAs,
(pri-miRNAs)] are first processed by the nuclear RNase
type III enzyme, Drosha, to release the hairpin-shaped
intermediates (pre-miRNAs) (5). Pre-miRNAs are typically
60–70 nt, and contain an 22 bp double-stranded stem and an
10 nt terminal loop. The terminal end at the opposite side of the
loop contain an2 nt overhang at the 30 end, which is typical of
RNase III products. Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cyto-
plasm by the nuclear export factor Exportin 5 and the Ran-GTP
cofactor (6–8). In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are cleaved by
another RNase III type enzyme, Dicer, to generate an 22 nt
RNA duplex (9–13). Dicer cleaves at 22 nt from the terminal
staggered end discarding the terminal loop region. One strand of
the miRNA duplex is usually selected as mature miRNA while
the other strand is degraded (14,15). Therefore, two-step pro-
cessing events are required for miRNA maturation: (i) the cleav-
age at the non-looped side of the stem by Drosha in the nucleus,
followed by (ii) the cleavage at the looped end by Dicer in the
cytoplasm (5,6).
Identification of novel miRNA genes is one of the most
imminent problems towards the understanding of post-
transcriptional gene regulation. Thus far, 227 human miRNAs
have been reported (16–31). Experimental cloning efforts have
successfully identified highly expressed miRNAs from various
tissues. However, cloning methods are highly biased towards
miRNAs that are abundantly and/or ubiquitously expressed.
On the other hand, computational prediction of miRNAs
could become a robust approach for tissue-specific or lowly
expressed miRNAs. Several computational methods have been
developed to find close homologs among related miRNAs
(29,32–35). The program MiRscan successfully predicted
close homologs of Caenorhabditis briggsae with statistically

conserved patterns of Caenorhabditis elegans miRNAs (35).
However, MiRscan failed to detect miRNAs that lack clear
homologs in related species. Recently, the structural features
of pre-miRNAs and the upstream sequence motif of miRNAs
have been incorporated in the computations (34,36). MiRscan
has been improved by defining the newly observed upstream
sequence motif and the patterns of flanking sequence conser-
vation for nematode miRNAs (34). Likewise, the program
miRseeker was able to predict new Drosophila miRNA
genes by screening closely homologous stem–loops in entire
genomes (32). A profile-based method is better than the pre-
vious similarity searches and can predict close homologs in
animal genomes by profiling the miRNA sequence family
(33). However, these methods also frequently fail to detect
miRNAs that lack detectable homologs.
In this study, we suggest a probabilistic co-learning method
based on the paired hidden Markov model (HMM) to imple-
ment a general miRNA prediction method to identify close
homologs as well as distant homologs. It combines both
sequential and structural characteristics of miRNA genes in
a probabilistic framework, and simultaneously decides if an
miRNA gene and a region of mature miRNA are present by
detecting the signals for the site cleaved by Drosha. We
employed this method to predict novel miRNA genes and
experimentally validated the candidates by examining the
accumulation of pri-miRNAs in the cells depleted of Drosha.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Datasets
We trained and validated the algorithm through 5-fold cross-
validation with a positive dataset [known human miRNA
precursor (pre-miRNAs)] and a negative dataset. We used
previously known human pre-miRNAs consisting of 81 50
strand and 55 30 strand mature miRNAs as the positive dataset
(available at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/
search.shtml, release 4.0).
The negative dataset consisted of 1000 extended stem–loop
structures randomly extracted from human chromosomes with
several criteria described in the Supplementary Material
(based on the NCBI build 34, version 3 of the human genome).
All stem–loop structures were predicted using the Vienna
RNA software package (37). These criteria were obtained
through learning the common structure of human pre-miRNAs
(38) and were also used for the extraction of extended stem–
loop structures similar to pre-miRNAs in genome sequences.
Probabilistic co-learning model of pre-miRNAs
An pre-miRNA can be represented as a pairwise sequence. It
forms an extended stem–loop structure, and this structure can
be formulated as a sequence of matched base pairs (Figure 1a).
The pairwise sequence starts from the non-looped side of the
pre-miRNA and ends at the loop. The state of each pair can be
classified on the basis of its base pairing status as (i) match,
(ii) mismatch, (iii) deletion or (iv) insertion. In particular, we
regard a loop structure as an ordered sequence of mismatches
and insertions as in the paired HMM.
Each position of the pairwise sequence has two properties,
i.e. structural states (match/mismatch/deletion/insertion) and
hidden states (information for the mature miRNA region). In
the structural states, each match state, M, can emit A–U, U–A,
G–C, C–G, U–G or G–U as an emission symbol. Deletion
states, D, can emit *–A, *–U, *–G or *–C. Insertion states,
I, can emit A–*, U–*, G–* or C–*. Mismatch states, N, can

emit one of the remaining combinations. The possible transi-
tions between the four structural states are shown in Figure 1c.
Each emission is represented as a corresponding character
in alphabetical order. In the hidden states, T means a true
state, namely a region of mature miRNA, and F means a false
state, the precursor region outside mature miRNA sequences
(Figure 1b). The probabilities of hidden states in this
sequence-structure co-learning model are estimated from
the distribution of all four structural states.
Screening of pre-miRNAs
To screen miRNPs, we estimate the probability of the pairwise
sequence of pre-miRNAs. To derive the probability of the
pairwise sequence of the states and the symbols, we need
to estimate two parameters: a transition probability and an
emission probability. For the transition probability, let us
call the state sequence a path, p. The probability of a state
depends only on the previous state. If pi denotes the i-th state in
the path, the transition probability is defined as
Tkl ¼ P pi ¼ l j pi1 ¼ kð Þ‚ 1
where the transition is from state pi1 = k to state pi = l. The
probability of starting in state k can be defined as T0k. Let xi
denote the symbol emitted from the i-th state. Then, the emis-
sion probability of observing symbol b in state k is defined as
Ek bð Þ ¼ P xi ¼ b j pi ¼ kð Þ: 2
Using the transition and emission probabilities, we can estim-
ate the probability P(x) that sequence x is generated by the
probabilistic co-learning model. It is easy to define the joint
probability of an observed sequence x and a state sequence p:
P x‚pð Þ ¼ T0p1
YL
i¼1
Epi xið ÞTpipiþ1 ‚ 3
where L is the window size. If we are to choose just one path
for our prediction, that one, p*, with the highest probability
should be chosen as follows:
p* ¼ arg max
p
P x‚pð Þ: 4
The Viterbi algorithm (39) is a common method for finding
the most probable state transition path and its probability
in HMMs. However, a straightforward application of the algo-
rithm is impossible in this case because the values of the
probability returned by the algorithm are very small. In par-
ticular, when the given sequence is longer, the probability
the Viterbi algorithm produces is smaller, exponentially. To
use the Viterbi probability for classification, we should evalu-
ate the Viterbi probability of the fixed-length sequence that
represents the mature miRNA region instead of the entire
sequence. We evaluate the Viterbi probability for the mature
miRNA region as
P x‚pð Þ ¼ T0p1
Y22
i¼1
Epi xið ÞTpipiþ1 : 5
On a given pairwise sequence, we search for the maximum
P(x, p) value by using a sliding window, the size of which is
22 – 2 bp—the mean length of the mature miRNAs in the
pairwise representation. We evaluate two P(x, p) values for
the models of 50 strand pre-miRNAs and 30 strand pre-
miRNAs, respectively. If the P(x, p) values for the 50 and
30 strands are higher than a threshold selected in advance,
then we classify the given candidate as an pre-miRNA. The
threshold was determined by the receiver operator character-
istic (ROC) curve analysis.
Evidence for validation of miRNP prediction
Statistical significance of minimum free energy. The thermo-
dynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary
structures can be assessed using minimum free energy (MFE)
and Monte Carlo simulations (40). Van de Peer’s group (41)
proposed P-values to assess the statistical significance of MFE
values of miRNAs and ncRNAs and developed the randfold, a
program for testing statistical significance. The P-values of
miRNAs were lower than those for other ncRNAs, with stat-
istical significance. The low P-value (under P = 0.05) pro-
vides evidence to identify putative miRNA genes from the
genome sequence. However, the stability and conservation
of secondary structures was stated as insufficient evidence
to predict new ncRNAs as a general method in a study on
the common structures of ncRNAs (42). Thus, to efficiently
predict miRNA genes, the statistical stability of the MFE value
should be combined with other information.
Repeat and published RNA sequences. No published human
pre-miRNAs contain human repeat motifs such as alu
sequences. Results of genome-wide miRNA prediction
might thus produce false positives of repeat sequences. There-
fore, candidates containing human repeat sequences should be
excluded. Human repeat sequences were downloaded from the
Alu sequence database of GenBank. Only 10 of the published
human pre-miRNAs could be matched with published RNA
sequences that include transfer, ribosomal and small nuclear
RNAs, and others. Some of these were located in the intron of
mRNA. Therefore, such evidence can be used as negative
information to predict pre-miRNAs in the genome sequence.
Here, we have aligned the sequences using BLAST to invest-
igate whether candidates contain repeat sequences or pub-
lished RNAs. The E-value threshold was 1020.
Prediction of a mature miRNA region and
a functional strand
Mature miRNA region. To apply the miRNA maturation
mechanism to our probabilistic model, we first detect the
stem-end of mature miRNA and then we seek the loop-end,
22 – 2 bp distant from the non-looped end. We introduce two
hidden states indicating whether the position is a mature
miRNA region. The probabilities that state whether the i-th
position is true or false are computed as
Pt ið Þ ¼ maxfPt i1ð Þ · Tti1ti ‚Pf i1ð Þ · Tui1tig · Eti xið Þ 6
Pf ið Þ ¼ maxfPt i1ð Þ · Tti1ui ‚Pf i1ð Þ · Tui1uig · Eui xið Þ‚ 7
where ti means that the i-th state is true and ui means that the
i-th state is false. The initial condition is Pt(1) = 0, Pf (1) = 1.
Using only the true and the false probabilities, we cannot
exactly determine mature miRNA regions, because the transi-
tion probability around the cleavage site of an miRNA is low.
3572 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 11
Thus, we focus on the transition probability of false states and
compute S(i) as
S ið Þ ¼ Pt i 1ð Þ · Tut
Pt i 1ð Þ · Tut þ Pf i 1ð ÞTuu : 8
Functional strand. In addition, we can determine the
functional strand of a mature miRNA not only by comparing
the probabilities of both the strands, but by absolute and rel-
ative internal stability of the base pairs at the 50 ends of the
pre-miRNA. The helicase initiates unwinding at the end of
base pairs with lower stability and the miRNP complex is
assembled with the 50 end strand, which becomes the func-
tional strand, at its unwinding end (15). To determine the
functional strand before prediction of the mature miRNA
region, the free energy values for five bases at the end
region are calculated from the known 2 nt free energy
value table (14).
Experimental verification
Depletion of Drosha was achieved by RNA interference experi-
ments as previously described (see Supplementary Material)
(5). Briefly, HeLa cells were incubated with small interfering
RNA (siRNA) duplex (Samchully Pharm, Seoul, Korea)
complementary to Drosha mRNA for 3 days. As a control,
siRNAs complementary to firefly luciferase (instead of Drosha
siRNA) were incubated with HeLa cells. Total RNA from both
control and test cells was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and used to synthesize a complementary DNA
(cDNA) with oligo-dT primers and the Superscript II enzyme
(Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was then used for PCR amp-
lification. PCR primers were designed to detect pri-miRNAs
and are described in the Supplementary Material. The size of
PCR products is 200–280 nt. If the given miRNA gene can-
didate can indeed express miRNA, the PCR product is expected
to accumulate when Drosha is depleted, because under normal
condition pri-miRNA would be rapidly cleaved by Drosha. To
quantitate the relative level of accumulation of pri-miRNAs,
we also performed real-time quantitative PCR (see Supple-
mentary Material). For real-time PCR, the relative quantity
of each product is inversely proportional to the threshold
cycle (CT) value. The difference in the CT value between
the control and the test sample means the difference in relative
expression level.
RESULTS
Evaluation of performance
We performed 5-fold cross-validation for various screening
thresholds to plot ROC curves, which is an effective method
for evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests. Figure 2
describes an ROC curve of 136 known miRNAs and a negative
dataset of 1000 sequences according to change of threshold.
Thresholds are provided as a parameter to predict putative
miRNAs in genome-wide search. When selecting thresholds,
the trade off between sensitivity and specificity should
be considered. We chose the threshold (P = 0.033) for the
classification of pre-miRNA candidates at the point that
shows 73% sensitivity and 96% specificity, on average.
We have performed additional evaluation with miRNAs,
recently reported by the Poy group, to reconfirm the efficiency
of our method. In the validation, we could predict the most
recently reported miRNAs, hsa-mir-376a, hsa-mir-377, hsa-
mir-378, hsa-mir-381, hsa-mir-382, hsa-mir-384, hsa-mir-423
and hsa-mir-424, which are unrelated to our original training
data. This result indicates that, unlike previously reported
methods, our approach may be sensitive enough to identify
unrelated miRNA genes.
Screening for miRNAs on human chromosomes
16, 17, 18 and 19
To perform genome-wide screening for miRNA genes, we
extracted 65539, 68458, 34853 and 62229 sequences of stem–
loop structures on chromosomes 16, 17, 18 and 19, respect-
ively, using the extracting method of stem–loops mentioned
above (Figure 3a and Table 1, see Supplementary Material).
Next, to verify the expression of the extracted stem–loops, we
performed a human expressed sequence tag (EST) database
search using BLAST (NCBI Entrez EST database; February 6,
2003). From the EST database search, 8153, 9367, 3135 and
7765 stem–loops on chromosomes 16, 17, 18 and 19, respect-
ively, were matched with human ESTs and the E-values were
below 1.0 · 1030 (Figure 3b, Table 1).
From these 28420 expressed stem–loops, our model ‘Pro-
MiR’ classified 817 pre-miRNA candidates. The candidates
included two of the three known miRNA sequences
(mir-138-2, mir-140) on chromosome 16, eleven (mir-21,
mir-22, mir-195, mir-196a-1, mir-10a, mir-132, mir-152,
mir-195, mir-301, mir-338, mir-108) of the 16 known miRNAs
on chromosome 17, four (mir-1-2, mir-122a, mir-133a-1 and
mir-187) of the four known miRNA sequences on chromo-
some 18 and seven (has-let-7e, mir-7-3, mir-27a, mir-150, mir-
199a-1, mir-330 and mir-371) of the 14 known miRNAs on

chromosome 19 (Figure 3c, Table 1). Because the candidate
sets still included many false positives, we selected sequences
using the additional evidence mentioned above to identify the
more reliable candidates. The miRNA candidates were further
screened as follows. We selected candidates with thermody-
namically stable stem–loop structures by testing the statistical
significance for each candidate’s MFE value using the rand-
fold (Figure 3d). Then we screened the candidates with con-
served patterns among vertebrates. Recently, computational
phylogenetic shadowing showed that the stems of pre-
miRNAs are strongly conserved in whole genome alignments,
whereas most terminal loop sequences are only loosely con-
served (43). The conservation of the flanking region of the
conserved pre-miRNA is rapidly decayed (43). Thus, using
the UCSC genome browser we investigated whether the putat-
ive pre-miRNAs show similar conservation patterns among
vertebrates (Figure 3d, http://genome.ucsc.edu, based on
NCBI Build 35). Finally, we screened the 23 representative
candidates using negative evidence to determine if the can-
didates matched with human repeats or published RNA
sequences (Figure 3d, Tables 1 and 2).
Some of the new miRNA candidates are found in clusters as
is often observed in known miRNA gene loci (Table 3). One
cluster contains two miRNAs (NC19-5 and NC19-6) spaced
900 bp apart and another cluster includes two miRNAs
(NC16-1 and NC16-2) spaced 5320 bp apart (Figure 4c). Para-
logs are also found: NC17-5 appears to be a paralog of NC16-1
with variation in loop sequences (Table 3).
To provide experimental confirmation, we sought to detect
the putative pri-miRNAs by RT–PCR (Figure 3e) (44).
Because pri-miRNAs, which are the primary precursors
for mature miRNA, are rapidly cleaved by the processing
enzyme Drosha, the authentic pri-miRNAs would accumulate
when Drosha is depleted in cells. Because this assay is based
on PCR amplification, it can detect miRNA genes that
are expressed at a relatively low level (Figure 4a) (44).
Nine putative miRNPs were confirmed using this method
(Figure 4b and Table 3). Seven of the 14 remaining candidates
were not detected in the PCR experiment, which may have
been because of their low abundance in HeLa cells. For further
confirmation, cells from different tissues and developmental
stages should be examined. The rest (seven) of the candidates
did not accumulate, suggesting that these candidates are
unlikely to be authentic miRNA genes.
The miRNA candidates confirmed by RT–PCR experiment
have relatively distant homologous patterns and show diverse
sequence patterns, compared with previously published miR-
NAs. However, these new miRNAs are not more diverse than
other ncRNAs. These results are provided by the phylogenetic
analysis for pre-miRNA sequences (Figure 5).
The results of real-time quantitative PCR indicate that some
of the new miRNAs are expressed at low levels (CT value
27–35, Table 2), and some miRNAs such as NC16-2 and
NC19-5 may be expressed at higher levels (CT value under
25). Low-abundant miRNAs may be difficult to detect with
less sensitive methods such as northern blotting and may
have escaped the conventional cloning (Table 2, Figure 6).
Interestingly, the accumulation folds of pri-miRNAs vary sig-
nificantly between the different miRNA genes. For instance,
pri-miRNAs for Let7a-1, NC16-1, NC16-2 and NC18-3 accu-
mulate more dramatically compared with those for miR-345
and NC17-5. This result suggests that pri-miRNA processing
by Drosha may be differentially regulated in different miRNA
genes.
Mature miRNA region prediction
We evaluated the accuracy of mature miRNA region predic-
tion through 5-fold cross-validation with 136 known miRNAs
(Table 4). The measures for assessment are the means of
absolute distances and the square root of the mean of the
squares. We found that for the 50 strands ProMiR predicts
the cleavage site at the non-loop side by Drosha more precisely
than the cleavage site at the loop side by Dicer (mean absolute

distance 1.96 versus 2.47 nt). For the 30 strand, however, the
end at the loop side is predicted more precisely than the end at
the non-loop side (mean absolute distance 1.60 versus 2.13 nt).
This indicates that the 30 protruding ends generated by RNase
III may be more variable than the 50 recessive ends. Altern-
atively, the 30 protruding ends may be subjected to additional
modification in cells (decay or addition of extra nucleotides).
The statistical signal of the cleavage site at the non-loop side of
mature miRNA is relatively more dominant over the one at the
loop side. This suggests that Drosha may be more important in
determining the sequences of mature miRNA than Dicer.
We correctly predicted the orientation of the mature miRNA
region for the 57/81 50 sense strand and 41/55 30 antisense
strand pre-miRNAs. The mean accuracy was 72%.
Permutation test for the learning model
From the results so far, we can conclude that ProMiR effect-
ively detects the cleavage signal recognized by Drosha.
However, it is difficult to judge where the major cleavage
signal originated. We designed a random permutation test
to investigate whether the high specificity obtained by our
model is caused by the base composition or the structure.
Thus, we compared the change of efficiency for the trained
model during 10 random permutations of the base pairs and
bases in the stem, respectively. To measure the effect of base
mutation, we randomly changed the base without changing the
base pair; the effect of structure was measured by changing the
base pair. Figure 7 presents the result of this study. The ln(P)
value produced by structural permutation rapidly decayed to
far below the threshold [ln(0.033)] even when the number of
permutations was only one. In contrast, ln(P) values measured
by sequence permutation reduced a little at the first permuta-
tion and then fluctuated near the threshold value. Thus, the
specificity of our algorithm is influenced more by the con-
served structural signals, such as match, mismatch, deletion
and insertion, than by conserved sequence information.
Comparison of efficiency with other approaches
Detection of the conserved primary motif or secondary
structure is a straightforward approach for identifying new
ncRNAs, especially, miRNAs (45,46). Several methods to
search the common motifs in RNA sequences or protein
sequences have been introduced. Profile HMM tools such
as HMMer are based on the frequency and the transition prob-
ability of the sequences and are usually used to detect con-
served primary motifs such as those for proteins and regulatory
regions in multiple sequence alignment (47). This method
shows the effectiveness of searching distantly homologous
sequences. Covariance models such as INFERNAL are usually
used to detect structurally conserved motifs (48,49). The suc-
cess of covariance models depends on finely curated structural
multiple alignments. In this experiment, we used MARNA, a
method of multiple structural alignments to search for con-
served secondary structures of ncRNAs (50). The esRCSG is a
method recently introduced to optimize RNA common struc-
tural grammar using genetic programming, a form of evolu-
tionary algorithm (38). This method does not need multiple

We compared the efficiency of our ProMiR model with four
different approaches including a previous miRNA prediction
method, which relies on the characteristic feature that the
known miRNAs derive from conserved stem–loop structures
(Table 5, see Supplementary Material). To perform a fair
comparison, we trained each model with various amounts
of data. This made it possible to search for the optimal result
of each method. In this comparison, the HMMer method by
multiple sequence alignment showed very low accuracy. This
might have been caused by inappropriate alignment results,
because miRNA genes have conserved structural motifs rather
than conserved sequence motifs. The results for INFERNAL
showed higher sensitivity when there were more training data,
but the specificity decreased to 0.18. This low specificity might

be because, when given more training data, the method learns
to recognize structures that are more common. Next, contrary
to our expectation, a method based on conservation did not
show improved performance. The lower sensitivity clearly
demonstrates that it is not suitable to predict unrelated
(not conserved) miRNAs. Finally, the results using esRCSG
showed more effective prediction than the other methods using
sequence or structural alignment. However, esRCSG gave
lower sensitivity (0.67) than ProMiR (0.73) using probabilistic
co-learning of sequence and structure.
In contrast to the previous methods, the result of the com-
parison clearly demonstrates that our probabilistic method is
more effective than previous methods and can be applied to
identify miRNA with close homology as well as unrelated
miRNAs (miRNAs with distant homology). Main reasons
for the advanced results can be explained by several criteria.
(i) The pairwise model considering structure and sequence of
extended stem–loops. (ii) A sensible negative dataset; an
approach to conserved structural motifs and MFE assess-
ment, realistically using the MFE as evidence for miRNP.
(iii) Additional evidence such as sequence conservation
among vertebrates.
DISCUSSION
We have shown that probabilistic co-learning of structure and
sequence is an effective method for the identification of
miRNA genes with close or distant homology. It could also
spontaneously predict mature miRNA regions. Another merit
of the probabilistic model is that it provides a common method
for identifying human miRNA genes as well as those from
other species.
In the genome-wide screening of human miRNA, we
determined a P-value threshold (0.033) from the screening
performance ROC curve shown in Figure 2, where the
sensitivity was 72.8% and the specificity was 95.9%, to
minimize the number of false positive findings and maximize
the number of true positive findings. The major reason for the
requirement of high specificity is that genomes are very com-
plex with noisy sequences such as repeat sequences, palin-
dromic sequences, pseudogenes and transposons. Thus, the
screening method should have a stringent classifier. Of course,
we can adjust this threshold to fine-tune miRNA prediction.
We performed human EST analysis and MFE tests to select the
more probable candidates. Additional resources, such as ver-
tebrate conservations and human repeat sequences, made it
possible to screen for more reliable candidates. Finally, we
verified the candidates by detecting the accumulation of pri-
miRNA. The main purpose of the experiment was to determine
whether the pre-miRNA candidates are indeed authentic
Drosha substrates. Therefore, the experiments clearly demon-
strate that our candidates are true positives (Figure 4). How-
ever, we still do not know whether the candidates not verified
by the experiment are truly negative, because the candidates
might be expressed in specific cell types but not in the
tested cells.
The mean error of the mature miRNA region prediction
results was 2.7 nt and the mean variation except for the 20
prediction failures was 2.0 nt. The main reasons for the error
may have originated from inaccuracy of the cleavage of the
pre-miRNA by Dicer, which bears an error of 1 nt and from
overhanging ends of 2 nt at the 30 end (51). In addition, there
are several instances of incompatible data for the locations of
mature miRNAs in the miRNA database (http://www.sanger.

ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/) that may lead to some errors in
mature miRNA region prediction. When these limitations are
considered, the result indicates that our algorithm gives mean-
ingful results for the prediction of mature miRNA regions over
pre-miRNAs.
The prediction of a functional strand on precursors is a
problem related with region prediction. The internal stability
of 50 terminal base pairs for mature miRNA improved the
effectiveness of prediction of the functional strand (14,15).
However, 25% of the prediction results were false despite
the clear criterion of internal stability. This is caused by the
exceptional characteristics of pre-miRNA. Most mature miR-
NAs on the precursors are located in either the 50 strand or
the 30 strand. However, some of the known miRNAs exist in
both the strands simultaneously. In addition, most pre-
miRNAs have extended stem–loop structures, but a few
pre-miRNAs have branched stem–loop secondary structures.
These exceptional features of miRNAs make it difficult to
predict the orientation as well as the region of mature
miRNAs. Moreover, because even 1 nt error in predicting
the mature region can result in the change of functional
strands, it is more difficult to verify the mature miRNAs
of the correct length. We firmly feel that the improvement of
our predictive model to overcome the limitations in terms of
mature miRNA prediction may make it possible to address
the problems.
Our study identified at least nine novel miRNA gene can-
didates from four chromosomes. Importantly, these novel
miRNA candidates are not related to previously reported miR-
NAs. These new miRNAs may define a novel subfamily of
miRNA genes as they have homologs and/or paralogs in many
vertebrate genomes. Further refinement of our model and a
more extensive screening is likely to yield a significant number
of novel miRNAs from various organisms. Effective miRNA
gene mining will greatly enhance our knowledge of small
RNA-mediated regulatory networks.

The gray boxes in sequences indicate closely homologous (orthologs + paralogs) members. The dotted line box contains other ncRNA sequences, i.e. tRNAs and
scAlu RNA. The new pre-miRNAs have distant homologous patterns to published pre-miRNAs—‘a’ homologous group shows distantly homologous pattern with
has-mir-193 and the ‘b’ homologous group is a distant homolog to has-mir-108; however, they are relatively closer together than other ncRNAs.
