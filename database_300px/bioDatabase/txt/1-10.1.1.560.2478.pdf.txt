ABSTRACT
This study describes a novel helicase-mediated
isothermal DNA amplification method that exponen-
tially amplifies circular DNAs. The circular helicase-
dependent amplification (cHDA) system is based on
the T7 replication machinery, which includes the
processive T7 helicase, an exonuclease-deficient T7
DNA polymerase (T7 Sequenase) and the T7 Gp2.5
single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein. After
the duplex DNA template is unwound by the T7
helicase, specific primers anneal to the separated
DNA strands and T7 Sequenase extends the 30 end
of each primer by a rolling circle mechanism to
amplify not only a region defined by the primers but
also continuous concatemers of the template. The
cHDA reaction can be carried out at one temperature
(25C) for the entire process and can achieve up to
10 000-fold amplification. Amplification can be per-
formed using purified plasmid DNA or a crude cell
lysate and can amplify inserts as large as 10 kb.
Following a cHDA reaction, the amplified products
can be used directly for sequencing and restriction
enzyme digestion without further purification. By
utilizing the helicase enzyme, circular DNA samples
can be simultaneously screened and amplified at
one constant temperature in one easy step.
INTRODUCTION
DNA amplification is a basic technique and an essential
tool in biomedical research and diagnostics. The most widely
used method, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), amplifies
specific DNAs, delimited by two complementary oligonu-
cleotide primers, using a thermostable DNA polymerase
(1). In PCR, temperature cycling mediates strand separation,
primer annealing and primer extension, to produce two
replicates of the template that are used in the next round of
amplification.
Despite its widespread appeal, the need for temperature
cycling in PCR limits its portability due to the significant
energy used in such sensitive instrumentation. As a result,
several isothermal DNA amplification methods have been
developed. Strand displacement amplification (SDA) utilizes
restriction endonucleases to nick double-stranded (ds) DNAs
that are extended by nuclease-deficient DNA polymerases.
The newly synthesized DNA is displaced to serve as a tem-
plate for antisense DNA synthesis, resulting in exponential
amplification of the target DNA (2). Restriction endonucle-
ases complicate SDA reactions by necessitating the use of
modified deoxynucleotides and primers. Similarly, multiply
primed rolling circle amplification (RCA) is a complex
method for amplifying circular DNAs using random hexa-
mers and F29 DNA polymerase (3). Multiply primed RCA
can achieve up to 10 000-fold amplification; however, the
use of random primers leaves the technique sensitive to con-
taminating DNAs. Although SDA and RCA are described as
isothermal amplification systems, both methods require an
initial heat denaturation step.
Recently, a true isothermal DNA amplification technology
that incorporates a helicase enzyme into the reaction scheme
was reported (4). Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA)
exploits the unwinding activity of a helicase to separate
duplex DNA targets during in vitro DNA amplification, elimi-
nating the need for thermocycling (4). Accessory proteins,
like single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein, assist the
helicase by preventing reformation of dsDNA. Once the
template DNA is separated, specific primers anneal and are
extended by an exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase to
yield two replicates of the original DNA; thus, achieving
exponential amplification. The first HDA system reported
used the Escherichia coli UvrD helicase and was only able
to amplify DNA fragments up to several hundred base pairs
in size (4). It was suggested that the inefficiency of the
UvrD–HDA system at amplifying long target sequences is

due to the limited speed (20 bp/s) and processivity (100 bp
per binding) of the UvrD helicase.
In this report, we describe a new helicase-based DNA
amplification system that employs a highly processive heli-
case and selectively uses circular DNA molecules to amplify
a very long DNA fragment. The circular helicase-dependent
amplification (cHDA) system amplifies circular DNAs using
the T7 bacteriophage replication machinery: T7 DNA poly-
merase (T7 gene 5 protein plus E.coli thioredoxin), T7
helicase (T7 gene 4B protein) and T7 SSB protein (gene
2.5 protein or gp2.5) (5,6). The T7 DNA polymerase is a
non-processive polymerase; however, when it forms a com-
plex with E.coli thioredoxin, DNA synthesis is catalyzed at
a speed of >100 nt/s with a processivity >10 kb per binding
event (7). The T7 DNA polymerase used in cHDA is T7
Sequenase (USB, Cleveland, OH), which lacks the 30–50
exonuclease activity and possesses strand displacement
activity (8). The T7 gene 4 encodes two forms of the helicase,
a 63 kDa (gene 4A) and a 56 kDa (gene 4B) protein (9). The
translation of the 56 kDa protein is initiated at an internal
initiation codon (Met64) that is in frame with the coding
sequence of gene 4A. The T7 4A protein displays both heli-
case and primase activities (10); whereas, the T7 4B protein
only exhibits a 50–30 helicase activity (11–15). Either form is
highly processive, traveling an average of 75 kb of single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) before dissociating (16). The T7
gene 2.5 encodes a SSB protein that is able to bind 7 nt
per monomer (17,18). The Gp2.5 protein stimulates DNA
polymerase activity and increases the efficiency of RNA
primer synthesis by physically interacting with the T7
DNA polymerase and T7 gene 4 helicase (19–21).
In cHDA, a modified T7 replisome amplifies circular DNA
templates in vitro. Amplification requires two specific
primers and a complete replisome, including T7 Sequenase,
T7 helicase and T7 SSB. The cHDA platform can amplify
not only the entire circular DNA template, but also a
specific target sequence defined by two primers and, thus,
plasmid amplification and screening can be simultaneously
performed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
T7 Sequenase version 2.0 was purchased from USB Corpora-
tion (Cleveland, OH). Source 15Q and Heparin TSK resins
for FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) were pur-
chased from Amersham. Chitin resin, Taq DNA polymerase,
restriction enzymes, T4 SSB, E.coli strains, nucleotides,
DNA markers, primers and plasmids, were obtained from
New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).
Cloning and expression of T7 gene 4B helicase and
gene 2.5 SSB proteins
Genes encoding T7 4B helicase (GenBank accession
no. AAP33931) and T7 Gp2.5 SSB (GenBank accession
no. AAP33924) were cloned using the ImpactTM system
(NEB). T7 gene 4B was amplified from T7 genomic DNA
(NEB) using primer 4B51 (50-ACCCTTTCATATGACTTA-
CAACGTGTGGAACTTC-30) and 4B31 (50-GGAAATGCT-
CTTCCGCAGAAGTCAGTGTCGTTGGACC-30). T7 gp2.5
was amplified from T7 genomic DNA using primer 2551
(50-ACCCTTTCATATGGCTAAGAAGATTTTCACCTCT-
GCGCTGGGTACCGCTGAACCTTACGCTTACATCGC-
CAAGCCGGACTACGGCAACGAGGAGCGTGGCTTT-
GGGA-30) and 2531 (50-GGAAATGCTCTTCCGCAGA-
AGTCTCCGTCTTCGTCTG-30). PCR products were dig-
ested with SapI and NdeI and ligated into plasmid pTYB1
(NEB) to give pTYB4B or pTYB25 for expressing the
T7 4B helicase and Gp2.5 SSB protein, respectively.
The pTYB1 vector produces a protein that is fused to an
intein/chitin binding domain tag for purification. Plasmid
inserts were sequenced and confirmed to be free of PCR-
generated mutations. The plasmid DNA was used to trans-
form E.coli strain ER2566, which expresses the T7 RNA
polymerase for heterologous protein expression (NEB).
ER2566 cells containing either pTYB4B or pTYB25
were grown at 37C in LuriaBertani (LB) media supple-
mented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin. At a cell density of
OD600 ¼ 0.65–0.8, protein expression was induced with
0.3 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
and cells were incubated for 16 h at 15C. Induced cells
were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were stored
at 20C.
Purification of T7 helicase and SSB proteins
All purification procedures were performed at 4C. For both
the gene 4B and Gp2.5 proteins, cells from a 3 litre culture
were resuspended in 60 ml column buffer (20 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA and 500 mM NaCl) and sonicated.
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 30 min and the
clarified extract was applied to a column packed with 20 ml
of chitin bead resin that had been equilibrated with column
buffer. The column bed was then washed with 10 bed vol-
umes of column buffer and self-cleavage was conducted by
flushing the column with 3 bed volumes of cleavage buffer
(20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl
and 50 mM DTT). The cleavage reaction was allowed to pro-
ceed at 4C for 64 h and the protein was eluted with column
buffer. The eluted protein was diluted to a final salt concen-
tration of 50 mM NaCl and applied to 1 ml Source 15Q and
then Heparin TSK columns using an FPLC. Purified gene 4B
helicase protein was dialyzed against a storage buffer (20 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
DTT and 50% glycerol). Purified Gp2.5 SSB protein was
dialyzed against a storage buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 50% glyc-
erol). Proteins were stored at 70C.
cHDA reactions
Three plasmids were used as a template in this study: plasmid
pREP is a pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vector
containing the E.coli Rep gene (2.2 kb) as an insert (GenBank
accession no. U00096); plasmid pTopo10k is a pCR2.
1-TOPO vector containing a 10 kb DNA insert (Dr J. Foster,
NEB, personal communication); pCR-4E is a PCR-BluntII-
TOPO (Invitrogen) vector containing a 1 kb DNA insert
and carries a unique BbvCIB site. Primers used in the study

1· cHDA reaction Buffer (35 mM Tris–acetate, pH 7.5,
11 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM DTT and 0.01% Triton
X-100). The reactions were incubated at 25C for 6 h and
10 ml was resolved through a 1% agarose gel. For a two-
step cHDA reaction, templates and primers were denatured
at 95C for 3 min and cooled to 25C, before they were
added to the remaining cHDA components and incubated at
25C for 6 h.

a cHDA reaction mix missing the three T7 proteins and incu-
bated at 95C for 3 min and cooled to 25C, before the T7
proteins were added and the reaction was incubated at 25C
for 6 h.
Pulse-field gel electrophoresis
A 1% low melting agarose gel (Seakem LE agarose;
Cambrex) was used in a contour clamped homogenous elec-
tric field at 6 V/cm. Switch times ramped from 1.5 to 11 s.
The gel was run at 14C for 16.5 h and Mid-Range I PFG
marker and Low Range PFG Marker (NEB) were used as
molecular weight standards.
RESULTS
Assembly of a T7 replisome-based HDA system: cHDA
A new HDA system based on the T7 replisome, named
cHDA, was developed to overcome the limitation on the
size of DNA fragments amplified by the UvrD-based HDA
(4). The UvrD-based HDA system uses the E.coli UvrD
helicase, Klenow Fragment (30! 50 exo-) of DNA poly-
merase I and T4 Gp32 SSB, and it amplifies DNA fragments
only up to several hundreds of base pairs. In order to amplify
longer DNA fragments, the cHDA system employs fast and
highly processive counterparts of the enzymes used by
these authors, the T7 4B helicase and T7 Sequenase. In addi-
tion, the T4 Gp32 SSB used by Vincent et al. (4) was substi-
tuted by T7 Gp2.5 in the cHDA system.
The performance of the cHDA system was examined using
the pREP plasmid as a template and a pair of primers, S1233
and S1224 (Table 1), to amplify a 2.3 kb DNA fragment car-
rying the E.coli Rep gene. The cHDA reactions of pREP
amplified a 2.3 kb DNA product as anticipated (Figure 1A,
lane 2). Surprisingly, the reaction additionally generated mul-
tiple products with a higher molecular weight, but no product
was observed in the absence of DNA template (Figure 1A,
lane 1). The 2.3 kb DNA product corresponds to the size of
the predicted product defined by the primers used, and
sequencing results confirmed that the product was the Rep
gene (data not shown).
To determine the ability of the cHDA system to amplify
longer DNA fragments, pTopo-10k, a vector containing a
10 kb insert flanked by primers S1233 and S1224, was used
as a template in a cHDA reaction. Amplification of the pTo-
po10k plasmid by cHDA yielded the expected 10 kb product
and higher molecular weight products, similar to those
observed with the smaller pREP plasmid (Figure 1B).
Characterization of cHDA reaction products
Amplification of plasmids by cHDA yielded a specific prod-
uct, and a series of higher molecular weight products. To
determine the identity of the higher molecular weight prod-
ucts, the amplification products of cHDA reactions using
pREP or pTopo-10k as a template were analyzed by pulse-
field gel electrophoresis. The cHDA products >2.3 or 10 kb
specific products of the pREP or pTopo-10k reactions,
respectively, were resolved into a ladder of DNA fragments
(Figure 2). The smallest band, b1, of each ladder correlated
with the predicted size of the entire plasmid and the insert
(for pREP, 6 kb + 2.3 kb; for pTopo-10k, 14 kb + 10 kb),
yielding an 8.3 kb band for pREP and a 24 kb band for
pTopo-10k. The next band, b2, also correlates with the pre-
dicted size of two repeats of the plasmid and each respective
insert. These observations suggest that the reaction mecha-
nism of cHDA is by rolling circle and that the identity of
the higher molecular weight products is a series of concate-
mers of the plasmid template (see Discussion).
Restriction endonuclease digestions of the amplification
products were performed to further analyze the nature of
the concatemers produced in cHDA reactions. Acc65I, SacI

and XhoI have a unique site within pREP (Figure 3A) and
digestion with either Acc65I or SacI linearizes pREP, produc-
ing a 6 kb fragment (Figure 3B, lanes 1 and 2). When pREP
was digested with XhoI and SacI, 2.2 and 3.8 kb fragments
were detected (Figure 3B, lane 3). When the amplification
product was digested with either Acc65I or SacI, the specific
2.3 kb insert was observed in addition to the linear 6 kb plas-
mid (Figure 5B lanes 5 and 6). When the amplification prod-
uct was digested with XhoI and SacI, 3.8 and 2.2 kb
fragments were produced, indicating that the 2.3 and 6 kb
fragments produced by a single SacI digestion were further
cleaved into 2.2 and 3.8 kb fragments by XhoI (Figure 3B,
lane 7). The digestion results are consistent with our hypothe-
sis that double-stranded concatemers with a unit repeat size of
the plasmid were produced by the cHDA reaction and the
smallest fragment is the specific target sequence defined by
the two primers. This result also indicates that, after the plas-
mid amplification by cHDA, the products can be directly ana-
lyzed by restriction enzyme digestion.
The use of cHDA reaction products for molecular biologi-
cal purposes was further examined. The cHDA products were
used in sequencing reactions using the forward primer S1233
(Figure 4A) or a Rep specific primer (Figure 4B). Sequencing
reactions were performed using an ABI Sequencer and 1 ml of
the cHDA product, without a post-amplification DNA puri-
fication step. The reactions yielded >600 bp of sequencing
data with low background, indicating that the cHDA products
can be directly used as sequencing templates without a puri-
fication step.
Analysis of the cHDA reaction components
Amplification by cHDA yields a specific product defined by
two primers and concatemers of the plasmid template. A
series of cHDA reactions were designed to determine whether
each reaction component is necessary for efficient amplifica-
tion. Components of the T7 replisome required for cHDA
were determined by omitting the polymerase, helicase or
SSB protein from the reaction. A complete reaction contain-
ing the T7 Sequenase, helicase and SSB proteins suppor-
ted efficient product formation (Figure 5A, lane 1). In
the absence of T7 Sequenase, helicase or SSB protein, no
amplification was observed (Figure 5A, lanes 2–4), confirm-
ing that each protein is required for amplification. Further-
more, no product is observed when only the T7 Sequenase
is present in the reaction, demonstrating that a DNA
polymerase alone is insufficient to support amplification
(Figure 5A, lane 5). Replacement of the T7 Gp2.5 SSB pro-
tein with equal amounts of the T4 Gp32 SSB did not support
amplification, suggesting that the specific interaction between
the T7 replication proteins is essential for cHDA to proceed
(Figure 5A, lane 6).
Amplification of the circular DNA template by cHDA is
performed with two specific primers. The requirement of
both primers in cHDA was examined by determining the abil-
ity of cHDA to proceed in the presence of only one primer.
Parallel cHDA reactions containing the pREP plasmid as a
template were performed in which one reaction had both pri-
mers and, in the two remaining reactions, only one of each
primer was present. As shown in Figure 5B, both the specific
2.3 kb fragment and large molecular weight products were
only amplified in the presence of two primers (lane 1).
When only one primer was used, no corresponding amplifica-
tion products were observed (Figure 5B, lanes 2 and 3).

Therefore, efficient amplification in cHDA is dependent on
the presence of the complete T7 replisome, consisting of heli-
case, DNA polymerase and SSB protein, and two specific
primers.
Isothermal amplification methods, such as SDA and
multiply primed RCA, frequently require an initial heat
denaturation step (2,3). To investigate the effect of a prior
denaturation step, two sets of cHDA reactions were simulta-
neously conducted (Figure 5C): One set was continuously
incubated at 25C for 6 h (one-step amplification), while
the second set contained the template DNA that was initially
denatured at 95C for 3 min prior to the addition of other
cHDA components and incubation at 25C for 6 h (two-
step amplification). No significant difference was observed
in the amplification yield between one- and two-step ampli-
fication when enough template DNA was provided
(Figure 5C, lanes 1 and 4). However, the initial denaturation
step increased the amplification yield when the amount of
template DNA was limited (Figure 5C, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6).
Sensitivity and specificity of cHDA
We also investigated the sensitivity of cHDA using varying
amounts of template DNA. The pREP DNA was serially
diluted and denatured at 95C for 3 min before introduced
to cHDA reactions. After a 6 h incubation at 25C, a similar
amplification yield was obtained from the cHDA reactions
containing 20–2.5 ng of the pREP DNA (Figure 6A). The
amplification was detected in the cHDA reaction with as little
as 20 pg of template DNA, although the final yield was
decreased accordingly when an amount <2.5 ng of template
DNA was used. In order to calculate the amplification fold
of the cHDA reactions, the amount of the 2.3 kb specific
product was calculated by using the amount of the DNA mar-
ker bands as a reference and divided by the amount of the
2.3 kb region in the template DNA. The amplification fold
reached up to 3.6 · 103 when 156 pg of total template DNA
was used. Since cHDA produces not only a specific product
but also concatemers of the circular template, which carry
multiple copies of the specific product, the actual amplifica-
tion fold would be much higher. When the same template
and primer pairs were used in PCR, the amplification fold
of the PCR reactions reached up to 4 · 104 when 10 pg of
total template DNA was used, and the amplification was
detected in the PCR reaction with as little as 1 pg of template
DNA (data not shown).
To find out if the low yield of cHDA at low template
concentrations can be increased by a longer incubation
time, time course experiments were carried out. Various
amounts of pREP DNA were used in cHDA reactions and
the amplification yield was analyzed at various time points.
As shown in Figure 6B, the maximum yield of a cHDA
reaction is achieved after 6–8 h of incubation regardless of
the template amount used.

various time points. The product formation was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, and analyzed with a GelDoc system (Bio-Rad). The relative yield (%)
of the 2.3 kb specific product was calculated.

Next, the amplification specificity of cHDA was deter-
mined by testing a variety of primers. A series of cHDA reac-
tions were prepared with a pair of primers: forward primers
were selected from primers S1201, S1226, S1233 or S1249
(Figure 7, lanes 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively; Table 1) and a
reverse primer was chosen from primers S1224, S1248 or
S1212 (Figure 7, lanes a, b or c, respectively; Table 1).
Two forward primers, S1226 and S1249, do not have a com-
plementary region in the template and, as expected, the reac-
tions containing either S1226 or S1249 as a forward primer
failed to amplify pREP (Figure 7, lanes 2s and 4s). On the
other hand, although there was a variation in the amplification
yield depending on the primers used, all the cHDA reactions
generated amplification products as long as two specific pri-
mers were provided to the cHDA reactions (Figure 7, lanes 1s
and 3s).
Colony amplification of plasmids by cHDA
The ability of the cHDA system to efficiently amplify plas-
mids directly from bacterial cells without plasmid purification
was assessed. The pREP plasmid DNA was used to transform
the E.coli strain ER2502 (NEB), and five individual
transformant colonies were randomly selected for testing.
Bacterial cells from each colony were suspended in a
cHDA reaction mix containing all the components except
T7 proteins. The cells were lysed by heating at 95C for
3 min. After being mixed with the T7 proteins, the reaction
was incubated at 25C for 6 h. As shown in Figure 8A,
although the amplification yields of five colony cHDA reac-
tions were different, all of the reactions were able to amplify
the 2.3 kb specific product and plasmid concatemers (lanes 1–
5) previously observed for cHDA reactions performed with
the purified plasmid. Amplification products from colony
cHDA reactions were sequenced and confirmed that the
pREP plasmid was specifically amplified (data not shown).
The sensitivity of colony cHDA was examined by intro-
ducing serially diluted cell suspensions to the reactions.
Colony cells were resuspended in dH2O and a serial dilution
was made. An equal amount of each dilution was either used
in a cHDA reaction or plated to determine the number of cells
used in the reaction. Products were detected from as few as
6000 cells harboring pREP (Figure 8B): without amplifica-
tion, no DNA with a size similar to the amplification products
was detected (data not shown). Maximum amplification was
observed at 1.9 · 105 cells (Figure 8B, lane 6), which is
equivalent to a half of one colony. Above 7.7 · 105 cells,
amplification efficiency diminished suggesting that cell lysate
contaminants became inhibitory. These results demonstrate
that cHDA can be used to accurately screen bacterial colonies
for plasmids and that plasmid DNA is selectively amplified in
the presence of genomic DNA.
Template preference of cHDA
The cHDA system is capable of amplifying a very long DNA
fragment using a circular DNA molecule as a template. The
plasmid DNA used in cHDA is mainly in the form of cova-
lently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) with a small amount of
DNA in a nicked circular form. To determine which form of
circular DNA serves as a better template for cHDA, we tested
either cccDNA or nicked cDNA in a cHDA reaction. The
nicked form of circular DNA template was prepared by con-
verting most of cccDNA (Figure 9A, lanes a) to nicked cDNA
(Figure 9A, lanes b) by incubating the pCR-4E plasmid DNA
with a nicking restriction endonuclease, BbvCIB. When the

sequences complementary to the pREP seqnence except two forward primers
S1226 and S1249, and amplify the same region. The size of specific products

cccDNA or nicked cDNA templates were used in one-step
amplification of cHDA, the cHDA reactions with the nicked
cDNA template showed a robust amplification compared to
those with the cccDNA template (Figure 9B). This result sug-
gests that the efficient amplification of cHDA relies on having
nicked cDNA as a template. However, this limitation can be
overcome by denaturing the DNA template before amplifica-
tion. As shown in Figure 9C, by denaturing the circular DNA
template, the cccDNA or nicked cDNA templates demon-
strated similar amplification efficiency in cHDA. We also
tested if the cHDA system can use linear duplex DNA as a
template, i.e. a PCR-type amplification. The linear duplex
DNA was generated either by digesting circular plasmid
DNA with restriction endonucleases (primers anneal in the
middle of the template) or by PCR with the same primer
pair used in the cHDA reaction (primers anneal to the end
of the template), and used in cHDA as a template. However,
cHDA could not amplify from the linear templates (data not
shown).
DISCUSSION
HDA exploits the cell’s replication machinery to mimic the
process of duplicating genomic DNA in vivo. During DNA
replication, a helicase unwinds DNA to provide single-
stranded templates for polymerase-dependent DNA synthesis
(22). Similarly, HDA reactions rely on the coordinated activ-
ities of helicase, SSB proteins and DNA polymerase to
amplify DNA. Helicase melts the DNA template and SSB
proteins coordinate replication, allowing DNA polymerase
to extend annealed primers (4). A new HDA platform,
cHDA, has been developed using the replicative machinery
of bacteriophage T7 that can replicate its 40 kb genome in
one initiation event (5,6). The cHDA system uses a modified
T7 replisome, composed of T7 Sequenase, 4B helicase and
Gp2.5 SSB protein, to perform helicase-dependent and
strand-displacement amplification. The T7 helicase, like
other replicative helicases, displays a rapid translocation
rate and high processivity, traveling 75 kb at a rate of
130 nt/s on ssDNA before dissociating (16). Using circular
DNA as a template, the cHDA sytem is able to amplify
both a target region defined by specific primers and the entire
circular template harboring the target DNA.
Based on the results from this study, the amplification
mechanism of cHDA was postulated to be a helicase-
dependent RCA, as illustrated in Figure 10. Amplification
is initiated by the annealing of a forward primer to a single-
stranded circle or to one of the two circular strands of the
plasmid. For simplicity, the primer is shown as annealed to
a single-stranded circle in Step 1 of Figure 10. The primer
is extended by the T7 replisome, which includes the T7
Sequenase, T7 gp4B helicase and T7 gp2.5 SSB protein;
The SSB protein is omitted from the figure to simplify the
diagram. When replication reaches the 50 end of the newly
synthesized strand, helicase binds to the 50 end and the
replisome begins strand displacement synthesis around the
circular template (Step 2). The displaced tail grows and pro-
vides multiple sites for reverse primers to anneal and to be
extended by T7 replisomes (Step 3). Primer extension contin-
ues until the replisome reaches the duplex ahead, and begins
strand displacement synthesis, releasing ssDNA products,
which carry one or more sites for forward primers to bind
(Step 4). The forward primers are extended by T7 replisomes,
resulting in the synthesis of dsDNA products and release of
ssDNA for the next round of strand displacement synthesis
(Step 5). Multiple rounds of strand displacement synthesis
by the T7 replisome produce a specific product defined by
two primers and concatemers of the circular DNA template.
The larger products increase in size by the unit size of the cir-
cular template present in the concatamers. Based on pub-
lished studies on T7 replication [reviewed in (10)], we can
speculate the role of each T7 protein in the cHDA system:
during the amplification process, helicases unwind duplex
DNA ahead of the DNA polymerase; SSB protein stabilizes
the transient ssDNAs unwound by the helicase by preventing
the reassociation of duble-stranded DNA, thus allowing
primers to anneal to the template; polymerase extends the
primers. When cHDA is used with a double-stranded
circular DNA as a template, the same reaction is carried
out on the complementary strand of the circle, beginning
with a reverse primer annealed to the template. Therefore,
ssDNA products generated from the forward primers can
anneal to the ssDNA produced from the reverse primers,

which may be an additional source for generating dsDNA
products.
Amplification by cHDA is dependent on the presence and
specific interaction of the SSB protein, helicase and T7
Sequenase. Without the T7 helicase and/or SSB protein, no
product is observed with only the T7 Sequenase. In the pres-
ence of all three proteins, plasmid inserts of up to 10 kb can
be amplified from bacterial colonies, bypassing a DNA puri-
fication step. Substitution of T7 gp2.5 with the T4 gp32 SSB
protein (Figure 5A) or E.coli SSB protein (data not shown)
does not support cHDA amplification. The T7 SSB protein
displays a high annealing activity that promotes base pairing
between complementary sequences (23). In a cHDA reaction,
primers are highly abundant and predicted to be coated with
the SSB protein. It is conceivable that the presence of the
SSB protein mediates homologous base pairing to stimulate
primer annealing and opening at the end of dsDNA to provide
an entry point for the T7 helicase, which prefers forked
duplex DNA with single-stranded tails (12,24). Binding of
the SSB protein to the unwound ssDNA produced by the
helicase is expected to stabilize each strand and to inhibit
reannealing. In addition, the T7 Gp2.5 SSB interacts with
T7 DNA polymerase and stimulates DNA synthesis by T7
DNA polymerase (19,20,25). It also stimulates the synthesis
of RNA primers by T7 helicase and was suggested to interact
with T7 helicase (24). Furthermore, T7 helicase and T7 DNA
polymerase form a complex and both proteins are required
for DNA synthesis through a duplex region (26–29).
The strand displacement activity of T7 Sequenase is central
to the cHDA platform, supporting displacement of the newly
synthesized strand. The wild-type T7 polymerase lacks strand
displacement activity and is unable to support cHDA (data
not shown). Due to the absence of the 30–50 exonuclease
activity, the T7 Sequenase used in cHDA has a lower fidelity
(error rate of 3.6 · 105) than the wild-type T7 polymerase,
which has a error rate of 1.5 · 106 (30,31). One approach to
further increase the fidelity is to combine T7 Sequenase with
a DNA polymerase possessing proofreading activity in cHDA
reactions. Another approach is to explore the use of the T7
SSB protein mutant allele, F232L, which has been shown
to promote strand displacement activity in the native T7 poly-
merase (32). The F232L SSB protein has also been demon-
strated to possess a higher binding affinity for ssDNA and
to stimulate T7 DNA polymerase activity (32). Developing
a cHDA system that utilizes the F232L SSB protein may
allow the use of the wild-type T7 DNA polymerase and
will improve the potential error rate associated with the T7
Sequenase enzyme.
Currently, an isothermal plasmid amplification system
utilizing the F29 polymerase is available for research use
(GE Healthcare). Development of the T7 bacteriophage
based cHDA system overcomes many of the drawbacks asso-
ciated with the F29 system, allowing a more efficient isother-
mal plasmid amplification. Amplification with the F29
system requires heat denaturation of the template DNA at
95C, followed by incubation at 30C for the reaction to pro-
ceed; therefore, the system is not a true isothermal reaction.
The use of helicase in cHDA reactions eliminates the need
for temperature cycling to facilitate access to the template
sequence by enzymatically melting duplex DNA. Further-
more, primers in the F29 system are random hexamers and,
in contrast, only sequence specific primers are utilized in
cHDA. Multiply primed random hexamers mediate efficient
amplification, but also render the system sensitive to the pres-
ence of contaminating DNAs. Additionally, the product from
the F29 platform is a hyperbranched and viscous. In the
event that the F29 system is being used for plasmid analysis,
an additional screening step is necessary to determine the
identity of the amplified plasmids.
Researchers typically rely on E.coli cells to amplify
plasmid DNA, by growing cultures of transformed cells
harboring the plasmid and purifying the DNA. This technique
can be time consuming and labor intensive when analyzing
numerous isolates. A faster, isothermal method that

DNA template is shown as a grey circle and primers are indicated as
arrowheads. T7 replisome consists of T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin
complex (grey oval) and T7 Gp 4B helicase (black ring): T7 Gp2.5 SSB has
been omitted to simplify the diagram. Step 1, a forward primer anneals to the
complementary region within the single-stranded circular template and the T7
replisome extends the primer; Step 2, the 50 end of the newly synthesized
strand is displaced by the T7 replisome at the extending 30 end; Step 3, rolling
circle synthesis continues and the displaced strand provides multiple sites for
reverse primers to anneal and to be extended by T7 replisomes; Step 4,
ssDNA molecules are released by T7 replisomes performing strand
displacement synthesis from the reverse primers annealed upstream, and
they provide complementary sites for forward primers to bind; Step 5, the
forward primers are extended by T7 replisomes, resulting in the synthesis of
dsDNA products and release of ssDNA for the next round of strand
displacement synthesis. Multiple rounds of strand displacement synthesis by
the T7 replisome produce a specific product defined by two primers and
concatemers of the circular DNA template.

selectively amplifies the target of interest for analyzing plas-
mids at room temperature has the potential to reduce the time
necessary for analyzing DNA constructs and facilitate high
throughput genetic screens. The unmatched ability of the
cHDA system to simultaneously amplify plasmids and screen
for specific inserts reduces plasmid analysis procedures
to one time saving reaction. The true isothermal nature of
cHDA will also allow performing specific DNA amplification
where a thermocycler is not readily available. In addition,
since cHDA specifically amplifies circular DNA, this technol-
ogy will be useful when circular DNA needs to be amplified
in the presence of contaminating linear DNA. For example,
the cHDA technology can be further developed to preferen-
tially amplify mitochondrial DNA from human cells for fur-
ther genetic analysis, or to detect the presence of circular
DNA virus in a clinical specimen or a specific plasmid in
the pathogenic bacteria.
