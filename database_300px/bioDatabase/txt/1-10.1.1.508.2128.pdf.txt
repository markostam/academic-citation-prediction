2007.—To investigate the relationships between race perfor-
mance and parameters at the optimal power output for lactate
removal, 10 male triathletes were examined. Exercise intensities
for lactate removal were defined by calculating 50% of difference
(T) between running velocity (Vr) at individual anaerobic
threshold (IAT) and at individual ventilatory threshold (IVT),
then choosing 3 Vr: at IVT plus 50% T (IVT50%T), at IVT, and
at IVT minus 50% T (IVT50%T). After a 6-minute treadmill
run at 75% of difference between IAT and V˙O2max, all triathletes
performed a 30-minute active recovery run at IVT50%T, IVT,
and IVT50%T. Capillary blood lactate was determined at 1, 3, 6,
9, 12, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes of recovery. The IVT50%T re-
covery was the most efficient Vr for lactate removal. Running
velocities at IVT and IVT50%T were highly (p  0.01) related to
cycle, run, and overall race time. V˙O2 values at IAT, IVT50%T,
and IVT were less (p  0.05) related to split and overall race
time. The variable most related to overall race time, as deter-
mined by stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, was the
Vr at IVT50%T (r  0.87, p  0.001). The R2 value of 0.76 indi-
cated that Vr at IVT50%T could account for 76% of the variance
in triathlon race time. This study shows that the race perfor-
mances of triathletes are highly related to the Vr at which the
most efficient lactate removal (IVT50%T) occurs. These findings
suggest that the assessment of Vr at IVT and IAT (from which
Vr at IVT50%T are calculated) may be a useful method for mon-
itoring training-induced adaptations and performance improve-
ments in athletes who participate in Olympic triathlons.

INTRODUCTION
T he triathlon is a multisport event consisting ofsequential swimming, cycling, and runningover ‘‘long’’ or ‘‘short’’ distances. The distancesof each competition segment may vary substan-
tially, so that the total competition time ranges from 30
minutes to several hours (25, 26). In particular, the stan-
dard distance (also known as ‘‘short distance’’ and ‘‘Olym-
pic triathlon’’) consists of 1,500 m of swimming, 40 km of
cycling, and 10 km of running.
A previous study (12) demonstrated an unexpected
rise in blood lactate (8.1 mmol·L1) after the first segment
(swimming) followed by declining levels after the other 2
segments (5.1 and 4.4 mmol·L1 cycling and running, re-
spectively). This lactate trend during a prolonged effort,
such as the Olympic triathlon, has been related with an
early appearance of ventilatory threshold and an impair-
ment of performance after swimming and cycling (8). The
correlation between the ventilatory threshold and the en-
durance performance is well known; in fact, for triathlon
performance the V˙O2 at ventilatory threshold was report-
ed to be a better predictor than V˙O2max (30) for both run-
ning time and total time (8, 31).
During a triathlon event, blood lactate was observed
to decrease progressively after the first segment. The lac-
tate decrement was observed to occur regardless of the
order of segments (12). It is important to remember that
lactate removal is accomplished mainly through oxidation
within mitochondria of active well-oxygenated red mus-
cles, as suggested by the lactate shuttle hypothesis of
Brooks (6). Whether lactate can be oxidized by working
muscles depends on the intensity of the exercise, because
different intensities can lead to different muscle behavior
from uptake to output of lactate (10, 13). Thus, because
lactate can be regarded as an energy substrate for work-
ing muscles during competition, particularly competition
of a long duration, a high exercise intensity during which
the most efficient lactate removal occurs could be consid-
ered a positive factor for successful performance. This is
because whenever exercise intensity is not efficient for
lactate removal, the resulting lactate accumulation is as-
sociated with an attenuate adenosine triphosphate pro-
duction that inhibits the glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes
and decreases the lipolysis rate (14); lactate accumulation
is also associated with a rise in muscle and blood H con-
centration, which has been related directly (19) or indi-
rectly (27) to local fatigue. Moreover, the lactate anion
can cause fatigue in skeletal muscle independent of as-
sociated reductions in pH (15).
We recently studied the optimal lactate removal pow-
er output in soccer players (2), quantifying the exercise
intensity not in percent of V˙O2max but in relation to val-
idated metabolic reference points (23), such as the indi-
vidual anaerobic threshold (IAT) and the individual ven-
tilatory threshold (IVT). In this study, we wanted to de-
termine whether the power output at which the most ef-
ficient lactate removal occurs is related to short-distance
triathlon performance.
METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem
This study was designed to determine the relationship
between power output for optimal lactate removal and
performance during an Olympic triathlon. For this pur-
pose, we verified, in laboratory conditions, the effect of
some exercise intensities below the IAT calculated in re-
LACTATE REMOVAL AND TRIATHLON PERFORMANCE 1161
lation to the IAT and the IVT. As previously reported for
studying lactate removal (2), 3 recovery intensities were
considered: running velocity (Vr) at (a) IVT, (b) middle
intensity between IVT and IAT, i.e., at 50% of IAT minus
IVT (T) above IVT (IVT50%T), and (c) 50% T below the
IVT (IVT50%T). We then investigated the relationship be-
tween race time recorded during a triathlon competition
and such laboratory variables as V˙O2 and Vr measured at
IVT50%T IVT and IVT50%T power outputs.
Subjects
Ten triathlon male athletes participated in the study. Af-
ter approval was received from the institute’s Ethics
Committee, subjects gave their written informed consent.
Their mean ( SD) physical characteristics were as fol-
lows: height, 1.81  0.03 m; body mass, 73  3 kg; age,
24  3 years; V˙O2max, 70.7  4.6 mL·kg1·min1; V˙O2IAT,
53.6  3.9 mL·kg1·min1; V˙O2IVT, 43.2  4.7
mL·kg1·min1. All subjects had been training regularly
for approximately 12–15 hours a week for at least the
previous 3 years.
All subjects were in good health and were not taking
any medications, amino acids, or other drugs, including
anabolic doping agents that would affect the results of
this study. None of the subjects was a smoker. All sub-
jects were counseled by a nutritionist and had a diet reg-
imen sufficient for their individual needs (44–50
kcal·kg1·d1: 55–60% carbohydrates, 15–20% proteins,
and 25% lipids). This diet regimen started 2 weeks be-
fore the experimental phases and was maintained
throughout the study. The subjects were counseled week-
ly and their food records reviewed to maintain the correct
diet and fluid consumption throughout the study. These
guidelines recommended that all subjects maintain their
food intake and remain well hydrated, especially before
each test. They also maintained their habitual sleep pat-
terns.
Detecting Optimal Lactate Removal Power Output
Subjects performed a treadmill presession test to evalu-
ate the V˙O2max, IAT, and IVT. Subsequently, subjects
performed in random order 3 experimental recovery trials
on treadmill on 3 separate occasions. A minimum of 48
hours separated each exercise test; the tests took place
over 3 consecutive weeks and ended 2 weeks before the
national triathlon competition. They began at about the
same time of day for a given subject (between 8:30 and
10:30 AM), and the environmental conditions were always
identical (temperature 21–22	 C; humidity 50–60%). The
subjects were requested to have breakfast (about the
same kcal·kg1 and nutrient composition) 2 hours before
the experimental test. No intensive training was allowed
on the day before each test.
Presession Test. To determine the V˙O2max, IVT, and
IAT, each subject performed a continuous, graded tread-
mill test. The treadmill maximal test consisted of a 3-min-
ute walking warm-up at 6 km·h1 with 0% slope, followed
by a velocity increment of 2 km·h1 every 3 minutes up
to the power output subsequent to IAT (1). Then a 3%
increment in slope every minute was given. When the
V˙O2max was obtained, an active recovery of 1 minute
walking at 6 km·h1 with 0% slope followed. V˙O2max was
identified at the occurrence of a plateau of V˙O2, despite a
further increase in power output or an increase in V˙O2 1
mL·kg1·min1 in comparison with that produced by the
previous power output (11). Secondary criteria were also
applied to verify the maximal effort, such as an attain-
ment of age-predicted maximum heart rate and/or a re-
spiratory exchange ratio 
1.15 (11). V˙O2, V˙E, and heart
rate were acquired breath by breath and then averaged
every 30 seconds during the test by a telemetric gas anal-
ysis system (K4 COSMED, Rome, Italy) that has been
shown to be valid and reliable (24).
To determine the oxygen consumption at ventilatory
(IVT) and lactate (IAT) thresholds, the average of the last
minute of each corresponding level was used. Determi-
nation of blood lactate was carried out using capillary
blood from a fingertip. Blood lactate concentration was
immediately analyzed during the treadmill test using an
Accusport lactate analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim,
Mannheim, Germany) that has been shown to be valid
and reliable (4). Blood lactate evaluations were performed
at the third minute of a given power output for each work
load until the power output subsequent to that corre-
sponded to the IAT.
The IVT was determined as the level of V˙O2 at which
the minimum value of the ventilatory equivalent of oxy-
gen (V˙E/V˙O2) calculated from an individual V˙O2 vs. V˙E/V˙O2
plot was observed (2, 16). To determine the IAT, we used
a simplified method previously validated (1). The IAT was
determined plotting an individual curve of V˙O2 vs. lactate.
In this curve, each lactate value was assigned to the pow-
er output immediately prior to that of its measurement,
and consequently the individual V˙O2 vs. lactate curve was
plotted (1). The IAT was defined as the power output cor-
responding to the second lactate increase of at least 0.5
mmol·L1 from the previous value, where the second in-
crease was greater than (or equal to) the first one (1).
Experimental Recovery Trials. To determine the power
output for optimal lactate removal, 3 recovery exercise
intensities below the IAT (2) were investigated: (a) IVT,
(b) IVT50%T, and (c) IVT50%T. Trial sequences were ran-
domized to eliminate bias. Each recovery trial consisted
of a warm-up of 3 minutes of walking at 6 km·h1 then a
6-minute run at 75% of the difference between the IAT
and the individual V˙O2max. This constant load exercise
corresponded to 90% V˙O2max previously utilized to study
lactate removal (2, 22). Immediately at the end of this
intense exercise, the desired recovery power output was
set and maintained for 30 minutes. The IVT power output
was the Vr at which the IVT (Vr IVT) was found. The
IVT50%T power output was defined as the Vr halfway be-
tween the Vr at IVT and Vr at IAT. The IVT50%T power
output was defined as the Vr at IVT minus the half-dif-
ference between the Vr at IAT and Vr at IVT.
During each recovery trial, blood lactate measure-
ments were performed at rest and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20,
25, and 30 minutes of exercise recovery without running
interruptions.
Triathlon Race Performance
Within 2 weeks after the last laboratory test, all subjects
competed in the national triathlon championship. The
weather conditions during the race were 20.6	 C, 52% hu-
midity, and a wind speed of 2.9 m·s1. The short-distance
race was held at sea level on a flat out and back course
and consisted of a 1,500-m pool swim, a 40-km cycle, and
10-km run. Drafting was allowed. The time to complete
the race was recorded by the race organizers to the near-
est second.

tate recovery curve as a percentage of accumulated lac-

most related to overall race time. Correlation coefficients

spectively.
RESULTS
Triathlon Race Performance
Table 1 shows the mean overall race time along with the
splits for each segment of the race. The corresponding
correlation coefficients for each segment of the race vs.
the overall race time are also displayed. The race time for
both cycle and run sections was highly related to total
race time (r  0.94 and r  0.90, p  0.01, respectively).
Also, the swimming time was significantly correlated to
the overall competition time (r  0.74, p  0.05).
Optimal Lactate Removal Power Output
Time courses of blood lactate concentration during recov-
ery at IVT50%T, IVT, and IVT50%T exercise intensities
were significantly different (p  0.001) (Figure 1). In par-
ticular, the lactate removal showed a similar curve at
IVT50%T and IVT until the 20th minute. At IVT50%T, the
lactate removal curve presented significantly lower val-
ues vs. the other 2 exercise intensities from the ninth to
30th minute.
Relationship Between Race Performance and
Laboratory Parameters
Selected submaximal physiological variables are reported
in Table 2. These variables include Vr and V˙O2 values at
IAT, IVT50%T, IVT, and IVT50%T. The interrelationships
among these variables and race performance variables
are displayed in Table 3 as correlation coefficients. V˙O2
values at IAT were significantly (p  0.05) related to cy-
cle, run, and overall race time. V˙O2 values at IVT50%T
and IVT were significantly (p  0.05) correlated to overall
race time. The Vr at IAT was only significantly (p  0.05)
related to running race time. The Vr at IVT50%T was cor-
related to cycle, run, and overall race time (p  0.05, p 
0.01, and p  0.05, respectively). The Vr at IVT and
IVT50%T were highly (p  0.01) related to cycle, run, and
overall race time. None of the selected submaximal phys-
iological variables was correlated with the swim race
time. The submaximal variable most related to overall
race time, as determined by stepwise multiple linear re-
gression analysis, was the running velocity at IVT50%T
(r  0.87, p  0.001). The R2 value of 0.76 indicated that
this laboratory measure could account for 76% of the var-
iance in triathlon race time (Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
The physical characteristics (age, weight, height) of tri-
athletes in the present study were similar to those pre-
viously reported for male triathletes (8, 25, 28). V˙O2max
values during treadmill running were similar to those re-
cently reported for elite triathletes (17, 25, 28). It is al-
ready known that the wide range in V˙O2max (from 52 to

72 mL·kg1.min1) reported by different investigators (26,
31) indicates that factors other than V˙O2max contribute
more significantly to triathlon performance. In fact, the
ventilatory threshold with the economy of motion (26)
and, more recently, the peak treadmill running velocity
associated with blood lactate concentration during
steady-state cycling at 4 W·kg1 body mass (28) have been
proposed as predictive parameters of triathlon perfor-
mance.
In the current study, IVT, also known as the first ven-
tilatory threshold (9) and point of optimum ventilatory
efficiency (16), and IAT, also known as the maximal lac-
tate steady state (MLSS), cannot be directly compared
with other studies because of different methods of thresh-
old determination. As previously proposed, we used a
3-minute incremental test for both IVT (1, 16) and IAT
(1). These 2 thresholds indicate 2 different exercise inten-
sities. The IVT indicates the upper limit of an almost ex-
clusive aerobic exercise (16, 18, 23) with a low blood lac-
tate concentration (about 2 mmol·L1). The IAT indicates
the highest power output at MLSS (1, 23, 33, 34), i.e.,
when the production and the removal of lactate are in
equilibrium (at about 4 mmol·L1). A previous study in
elite triathletes (V˙O2max 71.8  7.6 mL·kg1·min1) esti-
mated the MLSS by assessing the respiratory compen-
sation threshold during an every 1-minute increment-
load protocol (17). However, it was recently observed that
respiratory compensation threshold (1-minute incremen-
tal protocol) overestimates the MLSS by 10% V˙O2max (9).
Conversely, the protocol we used can underestimate the
MLSS by 5–7% (1). Therefore, the treadmill running ve-
locities we observed for IVT and IAT are lower than those
reported by Hue (17). However, we found Vr at IAT some-
what higher than that reported (3.7–3.9 m·s1) by other
authors (21) who estimated the lactate threshold using 4
different methods in nonelite triathletes (V˙O2peak 56.6 
1.3 mL·kg1·min1).
Whereas different studies have reported the physio-
logical characteristics (3, 25, 28) and physiological factors
or predictors of success in the Olympic triathlon (8, 17,
28), we have focused on the relationship between race
performance and the individual efficient power output for
lactate removal. The present data show that performance
in running and cycle segments was highly (p  0.01) re-
lated to overall race time, as previously reported (8, 28).
A certain relationship (p  0.05) was also observed be-
tween swim time and overall race time. Different results
in the literature could be due to the difference between
performing the swimming segment in a pool or in the sea.
The studied recovery power outputs (IVT50%T, IVT,
and IVT50%T) produced different lactate removal curves.
The significant lower values of the lactate removal curve
at IVT50%T indicated that this was the most efficient in-
dividual power output for lactate removal.
The Vr at different submaximal power outputs (IAT,
IVT50%T, IVT, and IVT50%T) was related differently to
split and overall race time. In particular, the Vr at
IVT50%T was highly related to cycle, run, and overall
race time (r  0.82, r  0.93, and r  0.87, respec-
tively; p  0.01). Also, the Vr at IVT was highly related
to cycle, run, and overall race time (r  0.81, r  0.91,
and r  0.85, respectively; p 
 0.01). In short-distance
triathlon, Schabort and colleagues (28) reported that per-
cent V˙O2max sustained at 15 km·h1 was significantly cor-
related with a 10-km running time (r  0.83, p  0.01)
and with the total time (r  0.81, p  0.01).
The V˙O2 values at IAT, IVT50%T, and IVT were less
related (p  0.05) to split and overall race times. In par-
ticular, the V˙O2 at IAT was related to cycle, run, and over-
all race time (r  0.67, r  0.63, r  0.69, respectively),
and the V˙O2 at IVT was related to overall race time (r 
0.64). The relationship between the V˙O2 at lactate thresh-
old and the 40-km cycle performance has been previously
reported (7). Also, for overall successful performance, a
high V˙O2 at ventilatory (8) and anaerobic (30) thresholds
was reported.
The main finding of the present study was that Vr at
1164 BALDARI, DI LUIGI, DA SILVA ET AL.
the power output of optimal lactate removal was the var-
iable most related to overall race performance. In fact, the
correlation coefficient of 0.87 and the R2 of 0.76 deter-
mined by multiple stepwise linear regression indicated
that Vr at IVT50%T alone could account for 76% of the
variance in triathlon race time. Apparently such a rela-
tionship between individual overall performance and the
running velocity at the optimal lactate removal power
output has not yet been reported.
Previous studies have shown that blood lactate, al-
though elevated after the swimming segment, decreases
progressively during triathlon races (12), indicating the
use of lactate as an energy substrate by exercising mus-
cle. Lactate oxidation from active muscles has been de-
scribed as the major pathway of lactate metabolism (6).
Slow-twitch fibers of skeletal muscle are metabolically ox-
idative fibers that tend to consume lactate (6, 32), where-
as fast-twitch fibers are glycolic anaerobic fibers that pro-
duce lactate (10). Which type of fiber is predominantly
active during an exercise depends not only on the exercise
intensity but also on the training status of the subject
(13). A triathlete may have a high percentage of slow-
twitch fibers as a consequence of metabolic adaptations
induced by endurance training (5, 13).
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The present findings suggest that better overall race time
is associated with a higher running velocity at which the
subject has his most efficient lactate removal (IVT50%T).
Having a high Vr at IVT50%T indicates that the triathlete
has a high Vr at IVT and little difference between IAT
and IVT (T). The shift towards a higher Vr of IAT with
a greater shift towards a high Vr at IVT led to higher Vr
at IVT50%T, the optimal Vr for lactate removal, which
was associated with better overall race performance.
These findings are of particular interest to coaches
and triathletes and are especially relevant to designing
proper training sessions. Previous studies have recom-
mended high-intensity interval training as a viable meth-
od for improving endurance performance, suggesting also
that regular assessments of training status and subse-
quent adjustments to the training program are required
to maximize performance improvements (20, 29). Interval
training alternates brief high-intensity exercise bouts
with rest or relief periods. We suggest performing the re-
lief periods at the exercise intensity corresponding to the
individual optimal lactate removal, such as Vr at
IVT50%T, in order to allow the next exercise bouts to con-
tinue with minimal fatigue and thus to increase the time
to exhaustion. In addition, because a high Vr at IVT50%T
is related to better overall triathlon race performance, we
suggest that regular measurement of Vr at IVT and IAT
(from which Vr at IVT50%T can be calculated) may be a
useful method for monitoring training-induced adapta-
tions and performance improvements in athletes who par-
ticipate in Olympic triathlons.
During a triathlon, high levels of blood lactate were
observed after the swimming and cycling segments (8.1
and 5.1 mmol·l1, respectively) (12). This may result in a
significant power reduction on the subsequent cycling
and running segments. In draft-legal triathlon, partici-
pants could adopt an individualized strategy because
drafting results in a considerable lowering of power out-
put (3). Moreover, race organizers may include 1 or sev-
eral hill sections within each loop of the course, such that
the race would involve a ‘‘stochastic’’ burst of very high
power output interspersed with more submaximal exer-
cise (25). The submaximal exercise would be performed
at IVT50%T intensity, and the lactate removal would be
optimized. In this sense, it is advantageous for athletes
to have a high Vr at IVT50%T, the power output at which
working muscles can efficiently oxidize lactate. In conclu-
sion, individual overall race performance in short-dis-
tance triathlons is highly related to the athlete’s Vr at
which the most efficient lactate removal (IVT50%T) oc-
curs.
