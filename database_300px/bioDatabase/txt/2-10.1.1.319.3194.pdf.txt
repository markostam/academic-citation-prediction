A detailed understanding of the molecular basis of protein folding and stability determinants partly
relies on the study of proteins with enhanced conformational stability properties, such as those from
thermophilic organisms. In this study, we set up a methodology aiming at identifying the subset of
cytosolic hyperstable proteins using Sulfurispharea sp., a hyperthermophilic archaeon, able to grow
between 70 and 97 °C, as a model organism. We have thermally and chemically perturbed the cytosolic
proteome as a function of time (up to 96 h incubation at 90 °C), and proceeded with analysis of the
remaining proteins by combining one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography
fractionation, and protein identification by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. In
total, 14 proteins with enhanced stabilities which are involved in key cellular processes such as
detoxification, nucleic acid processing, and energy metabolism were identified including a superoxide
dismutase, a peroxiredoxin, and a ferredoxin. We demonstrate that these proteins are biologically active
after extensive thermal treatment of the proteome. The relevance of these and other targets is discussed
in terms of the organism’s ecology. This work thus illustrates an experimental approach aimed at mining
a proteome for hyperstable proteins, a valuable tool for target selection in protein stability and structural
studies.

Introduction
Thermophilic organisms are a valuable source of proteins
with very high stability, the so-called hyperstable proteins. At
working temperatures above 80 °C, the stability of the proteome
is kept due to the combined effect of several factors.1,2 Among
these, extrinsic factors like the compatible solutes, acting as
chemical stabilizers, such as trehalose and â-mannosylglycerate
are particularly relevant.3 The concentration of these molecules
in the cell can be very high, thus, resulting in a stabilizing effect
which adds to intracellular protein crowding effects. However,
intrinsic factors play a key role in accounting for the high
thermal stability of thermophilic proteins. Protein stability relies
essentially on the additive effect of noncovalent bonds of weak
magnitude,4 which result in an overall stabilization of the folded
native conformation. Although there is not a general rule that
accounts for the molecular determinants, a series of particu-
larities have been outlined in proteins from thermophiles which
could explain their increased stability.1,2 Surface ion pairs, a
solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface, and efficient anchoring
of terminal extensions and loop regions seem to be particularly
relevant in enhancing protein stability. Thermophilic proteins
have an emerging interest both from a fundamental and an
applicative point of view. In particular, thermophilic enzymes
are of interest due to their potential application in biotechno-
logical or industrial processes where a biological catalyst is
used.5,6 Moreover thermophilic proteins constitute also excel-
lent working models in more fundamental studies aiming at
the elucidation of the molecular determinants of a particular
fold7-9 or protein structure; for example, see refs 6, 10. This
knowledge is essential for the understanding of folding mech-
anisms and contributes to the design of better structure
prediction algorithms.
Following our long standing interest in the study of the
stability properties of thermophilic proteins (e.g., see refs 8,
11-18), we set up a methodology which aims at identifying a
subset of the proteome of thermophilic organisms containing
the most intrinsically stable proteins. The rationale for our
approach is based on previous reports of thermophilic proteins,
which at physiological pH conditions (pH 6-7) remain folded
and functional even upon extensive incubation periods at high
temperatures; for example, see ref 11. The thermoacidophilic
archaea Sulfurisphaera19 was selected as a model: it is a
facultative anaerobe, living in acidic, hot, solfataric springs at

high temperatures with an optimal growth temperature of 85
°C, tolerating a broad pH range from 1 to 5.5, with an optimal
pH at 2. Its genome, which is currently being sequenced, is
more than 90% identical to those of the closely related organism
Sulfolobus tokodaii,20 for which there is inclusively proteomic
data available.21 Its broad growth temperature range (70-97
°C) allowed the study and analysis of the proteome obtained
from cells grown close to physiological growth temperature
extremes. We have outlined a protocol in which the cytosolic
proteome of Sulfurisphaera was chemically and thermally
perturbed as a function of time. The impact of the destabiliza-
tion was assessed by combining several approaches including
liquid chromatography, SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional gel elec-
trophoresis (2DE), N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrom-
etry methods for the identification of purified proteins and
spots of interest. A set of proteins with enhanced stabilities was
identified, and their relevance on a thermophilic background
is discussed.
Experimental Procedure
Cell Mass and Preparation of the Cytosolic Extract. Sul-
furisphaera sp. cells were grown at 72 °C (SulfCP72) and 92 °C
(SulfCP92) according to published procedures.22 Preparation
of the cellular fractions was essentially performed as described23
using 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, throughout all stages.
All steps were carried out at 4 °C in the presence of the protease
inhibitor PMSF (0.5 mM). The soluble extracts were divided in
small portions and stored at -20 °C prior to use.
Thermal and Chemical Perturbation Protocols. The soluble
extracts from SulfCP72and SulfCP92 were perturbed by two
different protocols in 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The
thermal perturbation included incubation at 90 °C for up to
96 h and sampling every 24 h. In the second perturbation
protocol, 1 M of the chemical denaturant guanidinium hydro-
chloride (GuHCl) was added to the samples, with subsequent
incubation periods at 90 °C. In both cases, after sampling, less
stable precipitated proteins were removed by 10 min centrifu-
gation at 14 000 rpm on a bench centrifuge at 4 °C.
Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Perturbed Proteomes.
Soluble proteomes obtained by both perturbation protocols
were chromatographically resolved using anionic exchange. A
HiTrap Q-sepharose FF (5 mL) column equilibrated with 40
mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, was used, and fractions eluted
with a linear gradient up to 1 M NaCl. Separated peaks were
concentrated (Amicon, 5 kDa) and loaded into a gel filtration
column (Superdex-75). Protein profiles were obtained monitor-
ing absorption at 280 nm. Eluted fractions were checked by
12.5% SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectrum.
2D Electrophoresis. For 2D-PAGE, samples were separated
in the first dimension by isoelectrofocusing (IEF). Samples of
thermally treated as well as not treated soluble extract were
precipitated overnight with 10% tricloroacetic acid (TCA) in
acetone, and the pellet was additionally washed with acetone
and left to air-dry before solubilizing in immobilized pH
gradient IPG rehydration buffer composed of 8 M urea, 2%(w/
v) CHAPS, 60 mM DTT, and 0.5% IPG buffer (pH 3-11,
Amersham Biosciences). Samples were rehydrated using 13 cm
long pH 3-11 NL IPG strips (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelec-
tric focusing was carried out using the following scheme: 30 V
for 12 h, 250 V for 250 V/h, 500 V for 750 V/h, 1000 V for 1500
V/h, 2500 V for 2500 V/h, and 8000 V for 3237 V/h, and finally
8000 V for 24000 V/h. The strips were equilibrated for 15 min
in 5 mL of solution per strip containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.8, 6 M urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, with the
addition of 0.1% (w/v) DTT and 0.25% (w/v) iodoacetamide,
respectively, in the same solution composition. The equili-
brated IPG strips were placed on the top of the 12.5% SDS gel,
sealed with 0.5% (w/v) agarose, and run for 15 min on 30 mA,
followed by 30 mA per gel until the end of the run. Silver
staining was performed with “Silver staining kit-protein”
(Amersham Biosciences), and gel images were analyzed using
ImageMaster 2D Platinum (Amersham Biosciences).
In Situ Gel Digestion. Complete Coomassie destaining of
excised gel bands/spots was performed by shrinking and
rehydratating the gel pieces with acetonitrile and 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, respectively. After vacuum drying in
Speedvac (Thermo, San Jose, CA), the excised bands were
rehydratated and submitted first to chemical reduction in a
solution of 10 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate left
for 30 min at 56 °C, and then to alkylation with a iodoacetamide
solution in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in the dark, for 30
min, at room temperature. In situ digestion was performed on
both bands and spots by rehydrating the gel plugs with a
solution of 12 ng/L and 6 ng/íL, respectively, of modified
trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 10 mM ammonium bicar-
bonate solution and left to incubate for 90 min at 4 °C.
Supernatants were recovered, blocked by adding 10% TFA, and
spotted on an AnchorChip (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Ger-
many) target plate. One microliter of sample was deposited on
the target plate and allowed to dry; 0.35 íL of matrix (5 g/L
R-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50/50 acetonitrile/0.1%
TFA) was then added and, again, allowed to dry. To the
remaining gel plugs, 30 íL of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate
was added, and the reaction proceeded overnight at 37 °C.
Supernatants were eventually withdrawn and analyzed by
MALDI MS and MS/MS.
MALDI Peptide Mass Fingerprinting. Mass spectrometry
analysis was performed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization tandem mass spectrometer having time-of-flight/
time-of-flight optics (Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF, Bruker Dal-
tonics) by using the data acquisition software FlexControl 2.4.
Mass spectra were acquired in reflectron mode over the m/z
range 800-3500. The instrumental parameters were chosen by
setting the ion source 1 at 25 kV, the reflector at 26.30 kV, and
the delay time at 20 ns. The instrument was externally
calibrated prior to analysis by using the Bruker peptide
calibrant kit (1000-3000 Da), and the sample spectra were
internally recalibrated with trypsin autolysis signals. Mass
spectra were elaborated by using FlexAnalysis 2.4. The peptide
masses present in each mass spectrum, through the integrated
software Biotools2.2., are used to search the NCBI nonredun-
dant database by using MASCOT software available online
(http://www.matrixscience.com/cgi/nph-mascot.exe?1), which
compares the experimentally determined tryptic peptide masses
with theoretical ones calculated for proteins contained in the
protein database. When NCBInr is used as protein databank
to search against, Mascot significance threshold is 64. The
taxonomy was set on Archea; carbamidomethylation and
methionine oxidation were selected as complete and partial
modifications, respectively; two missed cleavages were allowed
for trypsin chosen as cleaving agent. Searches were performed
setting a mass tolerance ranging from 20 to 40 ppm. Quick
confirmation of our results was made by searching also against
the Swiss-Prot (http://expasy.org/sprot) database by using the
softwares Profound (http://65.219.84.5/service/prowl/profound/
profound_E_adv.html) and MS-FIT (http://prospector.ucsf.edu/

ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm) which use different searching algo-
rithms to identify proteins. The accession numbers were
retrieved from the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
MALDI MS/MS Peptide Sequencing. The best S/N peptides
signals present in each MS spectrum and those identifying the
protein were submitted to MS/MS analysis on the Ultraflex
MALDI-TOF/TOF by using LIFT technology (Bruker Daltonics).
Miscellaneous Biochemical and Spectroscopic Methods.
Protein purity was monitored by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were
stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G or silver (Silver staining
kit-protein, Amersham Biosciences), and images were obtained
on ImageScanner (Amersham Biosciences). Protein content was
determined by the Bradford24 quantification method. UV and
visible spectra were recorded on UV-1700 Shimadzu spectro-
photometer. Folded structure of ferredoxin purified from the
thermally treated proteome was tested with fluorescence
spectroscopy measurements (Cary Varian Eclipse spectrofluo-
rimeter), monitoring tryptophan fluorescence emission be-
tween 300-450 nm, with excitation at 280 nm. Peroxidase
activity of the Bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP) was
tested by its ability to remove added H2O2 from a reaction
mixture containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7, and 10 mM DTT as
electron donor, at 25 °C using an amperometric H2O2 detection
(WPI Apollo 4000 system). Assay of SOD activity was done at
25 °C by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase method25 in 50 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with 0.1 mM EDTA; one activity unit
was defined as the amount of enzyme that caused 50%
inhibition of the cytochrome c reduction by superoxide (O2-).
Results and Discussion
High Temperature and Chemical Denaturants Induce
Proteome Perturbation. The cytosolic proteomes obtained
from Sulfurisphaera cells grown at 72 °C (SulfCP72) and 92 °C
(SulfCP92) were perturbed by two different protocols. The
thermal perturbation protocol consisted in incubation at 90
°C for up to 96 h, sampling every 24 h. After 96 h incubation,
the protein yield was 5%. To detail the enrichment of the
thermostable proteome, a combination of small-scale ionic
exchange and SDS-PAGE was used. Aliquots of the SulfCP72
proteome, which had been sampled during different periods
of the thermal perturbation protocol, were applied into a
HiTrap Q-sepharose FF column for chromatographic separa-
tion. From the obtained protein chromatograms, it became
clear that the extract is being selectively enriched in thermo-
stable proteins, which eluted at identical ionic strengths despite
the longer incubation at 96 °C (Figure 1). This provided a good
indication that the tertiary fold of the proteins in solution was
kept; in fact, protein unfolding results in the exposure of a
higher number of side chains thus changing the charged surface
with respect to the native state, resulting in a modification of
the elution profile which is not the case. The global impact of
the thermal perturbation on the proteome was also investigated
by SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2). An increasingly lower number
of bands were observed as the incubation time increases,
evidencing protein selection. Identical results were obtained
for cells grown at 92 °C. The second perturbation protocol
involved the combined use of high temperature (90 °C) and a
moderate concentration (1 M) of the chemical denaturant
guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl). SDS-PAGE analysis shows
that the presence of denaturant is sufficient to significantly
reduce the time necessary to produce a subset of the proteome
(24 and 48 h) (Figure 2). Interestingly, a comparable profile was
obtained from both perturbation protocols on SDS-PAGE,
suggesting a common selection toward proteins with enhanced
stability properties.
To further investigate and identify some of these proteins,
13 cm gels were prepared from SulfCP72 and SulfCP92 which
had been incubated for 24 h at 90 °C in presence of 1 M GuHCl
as well as in its absence (Figure 3). From these gels, relevant
bands were excised and subjected to MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis,
leading to the identification of five proteins: a DNA binding
protein 7e (DNA-BP, 14 kDa), the bacterioferritin comigratory
protein (BCP, 21 kDa), a superoxide dismutase (SOD, 28
kDa), the large subunit of an hypothetical CO dehydrogenase
(CO DH, 80 kDa), and a hypothetical Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase

enriched in thermostable proteins (marked with an asterisk),
which elute at identical ionic strengths despite the longer
incubation at 90 °C. In agreement, a decreasing number of bands
were observed in denaturing electrophoresis (see Figure 2).

(ACoA DH, 78 kDa) (Figure 3 and Table 1). These proteins
have enhanced stabilities with respect to the total proteome,
but they are not all equally stable; for example, whereas the
DNA binding protein and the SOD are found in thermally and
chemically perturbed extracts, the BCP and the dehydrogenases
are more susceptible to simultaneous chemical degradation.
In fact, the slight differences observed in the electrophoretic
mobility of these proteins may be suggestive of moderately
perturbed conformational states.
Proteome Analysis by 2DE and MS: Identification of
Hyperstable Proteins. The cytosolic fractions perturbed during
96 h at 90 °C were further resolved by two-dimensional
electrophoresis. The SulfCP92 proteome was analyzed before
and after the thermal perturbation (Figure 4): it became clear
that the number of proteins decreases substantially and that
even after such extensive incubation there is still a large
number of proteins detected. Proteins present in the native
(Figure 4A) and thermally perturbed (Figure 4B) SulfCP92
proteome were selected for further investigation by MALDI
peptide mass fingerprinting. Excised gel spots were digested
and submitted to MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting analysis.
To confirm protein identifications, the lists of the identifying
peptide masses deriving from each spot were carefully in-
spected searching for the best S/N peptides signal to sequence.
The structural information deriving from both the peptide mass
fingerprinting and the MS/MS-derived peptide sequences
greatly enhanced the protein identification confidence. The
subset of proteins identified from analysis of the 2DE gel (Table
1) can be grouped into three distinct functional categories:
proteins involved in cellular processes and detoxification; DNA
binding, translation, and protein modification; and energy
metabolism. Two of the identified proteins, superoxide dis-
mutase and Bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP, a per-
oxiredoxin) had already been identified from the 1D gel
analysis. Four identified proteins (DNA binding protein Alba-
2, hypothetical DNA-binding protein 7e, hypothetical elonga-
tion factor 1-alpha, Thermosome â subunit) are involved in
nucleic acid processing and protein modification processes. In
particular the DNA binding protein Alba-2 was previously
identified by analyzing 1D gel of perturbed proteome. Finally,
eight proteins involved in energy metabolism processes were
identified, among which are several hypothetical dehydroge-
nases and the iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin (Table 1). MALDI
MS and MS/MS spectra of superoxide dismutase, DNA binding
protein Alba-2, and ferredoxin, each belonging to one of the
three different biological classes, have been selected as an
example and reported in Figure 5.
The type of cellular processes in which the identified proteins
are involved is very interesting and noteworthy from the point
of view of the Sulfurisphaera’s optimal growth conditions at
high temperatures. The identified proteins participate in cel-
lular processes (e.g., defense against reactive oxygen species,
nucleic acid protection, and energy production) in which some
key proteins have enhanced thermal stabilities, which may
relate to their importance on the metabolism of a thermophile.
For example, at temperatures above 70 °C, DNA is particularly
susceptible to chemical modifications, mainly depurination
followed by cleavage of the nearby phosphodiesteric bond,
thus, making DNA binding proteins particularly important as
these wind and compact DNA, protecting it.1 In agreement,
several DNA-binding proteins were identified in this study

(Table 1). Concerning the energy metabolism proteins, the
hypothetical dehydrogenases identified suggest that some
electron-transfer pathways involved in energy production
processes involve particularly stable proteins. A common
feature among these proteins is that they comprise a NAD(P)-
binding Rossman fold; however, since this is one of the most
populated folds in proteins, typical among dehydrogenases, a
direct correlation with enhanced protein stability cannot be
postulated. Finding proteins involved in cellular detoxification
processes to be hyperstable may be rationalized with the fact
that high temperatures and aerobic growth conditions are
prone to an increased cellular oxidative stress. In these
circumstances, the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
formed during electron-transfer processes is likely to be
increased as a result of electron leakage from redox proteins
and reduced cofactors. This calls for a particularly stable set
of ROS defense proteins such as peroxiredoxin and superoxide
dismutase (Table 1). Altogether, these results suggest that some
metabolic processes in thermophiles may require a ‘thermo-
stable character’ in order to cope with the specificities of life
at high temperatures.
Proteins from the Pool of Selected Hyperstable Proteins
Are Biologically Active. Thermophilic proteins can be intrinsi-
cally very stable and exhibit a very high kinetic stability toward
thermal degradation. We have validated our proteome pertur-
bation method by verifying the extent to which the subset of
proteins obtained after the perturbation corresponds to bio-
logically active molecules. Three distinct proteins were selected
from the perturbed subset: the iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin
(Fd), the peroxiredoxin Bacterioferritin comigratory protein
(Prx-BCP), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Whereas Fd is an
electron carrier present in most thermoacidophilic Archaea,
Prx-BCP and SOD are enzymes that are, respectively, involved
in the detoxification of peroxides and superoxide. For this
characterization, we have set up a small-scale two-step chro-
matographic procedure for partly resolving the thermally
perturbed SulfCP92 proteome. Starting from the 96 h incubated
SulfCP92 proteome, and using a combination of anionic
exchange (Q-sepharose HiPrep) and gel filtration (S-75), a
protein fraction corresponding to a molecular weight of 12
kDa, as determined from SDS-PAGE, was obtained. Sequencing
of its N-terminus (1-GIDPNYRTNRQVVGEHSK-G) clearly showed
that this protein corresponds to ferredoxin.
A preliminary biophysical characterization was carried out
on this purified band, and its assignment as a Fd was cor-
roborated by obtaining the typical UV-visible spectrum, with
the characteristic band at 410 nm corresponding to native Fd
with intact Fe-S clusters (not shown). The Sulfurisphaera
ferredoxin has orthologues in other thermophilic Sulfolo-
bales,11,16 and these proteins are characterized by a very high
thermal stability; they have very high midpoint melting transi-
tions (Tm ) 110 °C at pH 7 for the Acidianus ambivalens Fd) as
well as a very high kinetic stability.11 The protein core harboring
the two iron-sulfur centers is likely to play an important role
in protein thermostability, as well as a Zn-containing N-
terminal extension.11,26
The SOD27 and Prx-BCP28 activities were measured in the
native and perturbed SulfCP72 proteome. Not only were both
activities present, but also a specific activity increase of the
enzymes was observed (Figure 6). This observation is compat-
ible with a significant enrichment of these two enzymes in the
thermally treated extract, as a result of their enhanced ther-
mostability. Whereas little is yet known concerning the mo-
lecular origins of Prx-BCP stability, there are several studies
on thermophilic SODs.27 The available data on Archaeal Fe-
SODs corroborates our finding that these proteins are among
the most thermostable in the cell. For example, the Sulfolobus
acidocaldarius SOD, which is a functional tetramer, has a very
high stability undergoing structural thermal melting at 125 °C,
a temperature which is 40 °C above the organism optimal
growth temperature.27 Structural analysis suggests that the
increase protein stability may result from its quaternary
structure, a tight packing of buried hydrophobic residues, and
an increased number of ion pairs.27
Conclusions
Here we have outlined an experimental strategy which allows
mining proteomes for proteins having enhanced stability

properties. This approach is particularly valuable for the
identification of proteins which can be used in subsequent
studies aimed at the understanding of protein stability, func-
tion, or structural features. Following our interest in the study
of conformational properties of thermophilic proteins, we have
selected Sulfurisphaera sp. as a model organism to implement
this methodology; the identification of hyperstable proteins in
a thermophilic background required drastic perturbation pro-
tocols (e.g., 4 days at 90 °C), which nevertheless resulted in
the identification of a subset of proteins which remained folded
after the perturbation and provided an insightful perspective
into the type of essential cellular processes requiring particu-
larly resistant proteins. In fact, many of the identified proteins
are involved in stress response mechanisms that aim at
protecting nucleic acids and proteins from aggression elements
such as thermal stress and reactive oxygen species. In this
respect, this approach highlighted not only proteins interesting
for subsequent stability studies, but also key metabolic pro-
cesses which may have themselves a ‘thermophilic character’.
Recently, efficient expression systems have been developed29
using the closely related hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfa-
taricus as an efficient expression system of tagged proteins,
thus, greatly facilitating the production of proteins of interest
such as those identified in this work for subsequent studies.
