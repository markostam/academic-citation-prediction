Rust fungi in the genus Phragmidium are frequent pathogens of both wild and cultivated roses. We investigated the
occurrence and relationships of rusts on dog roses, Rosa sect. Caninae (Rosa canina, R. corymbifera and R. rubiginosa)
in Germany. Two Phragmidium species, P. mucronatum and P. tuberculatum, were able to infect each of the three dog
rose species examined. However, the overall infection of R. rubiginosa was signiﬁcantly lower, which could be important
for rose breeding. Despite overlapping host ranges, the evolutionary background of P. tuberculatum and P. mucronatum
is quite distinct. Phylogenetic analyses of the D1/D2 region of the LSU rDNA suggest that P. mucronatum shares a
common ancestor with other rose rusts, whereas P. tuberculatum evolved from a Rubus-Sanguisorba rust clade and
must have undergone a host shift to Rosa spp.
INTRODUCTION
The predominantly Northern Hemisphere rust genus
Phragmidium comprises about 60 species (Cummins &
Hiratsuka 2003). Phragmidium species, like the entire
family Phragmidiaceae, have an autoecious life-cycle
and are restricted to rosaceous hosts, with only two
documented exceptions from the USA (Peterson &
Cronin 1967). On dog roses four Phragmidium species
can be found in Central Europe, viz. P. fusiforme,
P. mucronatum, P. tuberculatum, and P. rosae-
pimpinellifoliae. However, the taxonomic history of
many species is rather complex (Dietel 1905a, b) and
especially the Phragmidium species on roses, ‘Form-
enkreis Phragmidium mucronatum ’, were said to have
overlapping morphological characters (Ga¨umann
1959). This casts doubt onto the broad host ranges
stated for P. mucronatum and P. tuberculatum since
these species could have been misidentiﬁed due to
excessively broad morphological species concepts (cfr
Newcombe 2003).
The Eurasian dog roses (Rosa sect. Caninae) are a
morphologically and genetically highly diverse group,
about 30 species of which can be found in Central
Europe (Kla´sˇtersky` 1969, Henker & Schulze 1993).
Their most striking feature is a unique meiotic behav-
iour, the so-called ‘Canina-meiosis ’ (Ta¨ckholm 1920,
1922), where the pentaploid genome is distributed
unequally during meiosis resulting in haploid pollen
grains and tetraploid egg cells. After fertilization, the
pentaploid state is restored and results in full sexual
reproduction (Wissemann & Hellwig 1997).
We investigated which rust species can be found on
the three most common dog rose species in Germany
(Rosa canina, R. corymbifera, and R. rubiginosa). We
examined the frequency of the occurring rusts and
whether these rust species show any infection pre-
ference for a particular rose host. By means of mol-
ecular phylogenetic analyses based on nrLSU sequence
data we tested whether the morphological species
determinations proved valid and whether there is
any correlation between speciﬁc host infection and
pathogen phylogeny.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling and collection
Three species of dog roses diﬀering in leaf sur-
face characters were investigated, i.e. R. canina with
glabrous leaves, R. corymbifera with hairy leaves, and

R. rubiginosa with glandular leaves. Rust fungi from
these hosts were collected during Aug. 2002 in
Germany at 16 sample sites representing a geographical
north-south axis of 800 km (Fig. 1). A sample site
consists of populations of the respective host-species
and represents an area of 500 to 1000 square metres.
Rust specimens used for DNA analyses, voucher in-
formation, and GenBank accession numbers are listed
in Table 1. For DNA extraction, rust fungi were col-
lected as silica-gel dried infected leaf material.
15 rose bushes (ﬁve bushes per species) were sampled
at each site. Rust infection was recorded as categorical
data (presence or absence of rust). In the case of infec-
tion, the rust species was morphologically identiﬁed
after Ga¨umann (1959) based on either aeciospore or
teliospore characters, using a Carl Zeiss microscopes
(with bright ﬁeld and phase contrast optics). Specimens
of rust fungi were deposited in the reference collections
of the University of Tu¨bingen (TUB). Statistical
analyses of rust infections were performed using the
software package SPSS 11.0. Presence/absence data of
rust infection were compared between the rose species
using logistic regression. Abundance of rust fungi and
niche diﬀerentiation (e.g. the preferential infection of a
given host by one of the two rust species) were analysed
using a six-ﬁeld Chi2 test. Since the absolute abundance
of the two observed rust species was found to be very
diﬀerent, the expected values of the six-ﬁeld-test were
corrected for the relative frequency of the respective
rust fungus.
We determined nrLSU sequences for P. mucronatum,
P. fusiforme and P. tuberculatum and integrated all
available (nrLSU) sequences of Phragmidiaceae from
an earlier study (Maier et al. 2003) for phylogenetic
analyses.
DNA extraction
Total DNA was extracted from either aeciospores or
teliospores using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
protocol was modiﬁed by shaking the dried samples
with the help of a mixer mill (MM 300, Retsch, Haan)
for 3 min at 30 Hz in a 1.5 ml tube together with one
tungsten carbide ball (3 mm diam).
DNA ampliﬁcation
The 5k end of the nuclear 28S rRNA gene (nrLSU) was
ampliﬁed from diluted extracts (10x1 and 10x2).
Primers for the ampliﬁcation were LR0R (5k-ACC
CGC TGA ACT TAA GC) described by Moncalvo
et al. (1995) and LR6 (5k-CGC CAG TTC TGC TTA
CC) described by Vilgalys & Hester (1990). PCR con-
ditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 xC
for 180 s, 12 cycles of 94 x for 35 s, 45 x for 45 s, 72 x for
60 s, 12 cycles of 94 x for 35 s, 45 x for 55 s, 72 x for 90 s,
12 cycles of 94 x for 35 s, 45 x for 60 s, 72 x for 120 s and
a ﬁnal elongation of 72 x for 10 min.
Sequencing
The ampliﬁed DNA was puriﬁed using Qiaquick PCR
puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions, and was then sequenced directly in both
directions. Cycle-sequencing was performed using the
ABI PRISM Big DyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems,
Warrington) or the ThermoSequenase labelled primer
cycle sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala)
with the unlabelled or IRD-labelled primers NLMW1
(5k-TCA ATA AGC GGA GGA AAA GA; Sampaio
et al. 2002) and NL4 (5k-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG
ACG G; O’Donnell 1992, 1993). The cycle sequencing
proﬁle was 25 cycles of 96 x for 10 s, 50 x for 5 s, and
60 x for 4 min. The resulting DNA fragments were
separated on an acrylamide gel, using an automatic

Phylogenetic reconstructions
Sequence alignment was carried out using the software
Clustal X 1.83 (Thompson et al. 1997) followed by
slight manual editing. The ﬁnal alignment has been
deposited in TreeBASE (http://www.herbaria.harvard.
edu/treebase/) and is accessible under study accession
no. SN1944.
Parsimony analyses were performed using the heu-
ristic search mode in PAUP 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord 2002)
with 100 random addition sequence replicates and TBR
branch swapping. All character states were treated as
unordered, equally weighted and gaps were treated as
missing characters. Branch support was evaluated by
1000 bootstrap replicates (Felsenstein 1985) and with
the help of Bremer support (Bremer 1994) using the
software AutoDecay 3.0 (Eriksson & Wikstro¨m 1995).
Bayesian inference of phylogeny using Monte Carlo
Markov chains (MCMC) was conducted with MrBayes
3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001). Four in-
crementally heated simultaneous Monte Carlo Markov
chains were run over 2.000.000 generations, using the
DNA substitution model of Hasegawa, Kishino and
Yano (HKY 85; Hasegawa et al. 1985) with gamma-
distributed substitution rates (Swoﬀord et al. 1996),
random starting trees and default starting values of the
very DNA substitution model. The HKY+G model of
DNA substitution was chosen by both the Akaike
information criterion and the likelihood ratio tests
implemented in MrModeltest 1.0b (Nylander 2002).
Trees were sampled every 100 generations resulting in
an overall sampling of 20 001 trees. The ﬁrst 1000 trees
were discarded as burnin. From the remaining trees a
50% majority rule consensus tree was computed to
obtain estimates for the a posteriori probabilities.
Branch lengths were estimated as mean values over the
sampled trees. This Bayesian approach of phylogenetic
analysis was repeated four times, always using random
starting trees and random starting values for the
HKY85 model to test the independence of the results
from topological priors (Huelsenbeck et al. 2002).
Furthermore, a neighbour-joining analysis was
performed also using HKY 85 as DNA substitution
model.
The unrooted dendrograms from neighbour joining,
parsimony and MCMC analyses were rooted with
Kuehneola uredinis, Triphragmium ulmariae and
Trachyspora intrusa according to the ﬁndings of Maier
et al. (2003).

Statistical analyses of infection
The number of rose bushes (R. canina, R. corymbifera,
and R. rubiginosa) infected by P. mucronatum and P.
tuberculatum is shown in Table 2. The investigated rose
species displayed diﬀerent responses to rust infection
(logistic Regression; Wald=31.64, df=2, P<0.001).
Rust infection on R. rubiginosa was signiﬁcantly lower
compared to R. canina (log. Reg. ; Wald=30.37, df=1,
P<0.001) and R. corymbifera (log. Reg. ; Wald=18.75,
df=1, P<0.001), whereby no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
of rust infection could be detected between R. canina
and R. corymbifera (log. Reg. ; Wald=2.05, df=1,
P=0.15). These results did not change if the logistic
regression was performed for the two rust species sep-
arately. Additionally, we tested whether P. mucronatum
and P. tuberculatum showed a niche diﬀerentiation
among the three rose species. Since P. tuberculatum was
signiﬁcantly rarer than P. mucronatum on the three
investigated rose species (x21=10.37, P=0.001), the
expected values of the six-ﬁeld-test were corrected
for the relative abundance of the rust fungus (Table 2).
No signiﬁcant host preferences could be detected be-
tween the two rust fungi (x21=0.47, P=0.79).
Phylogenetic reconstructions
Phylogenetic analyses of the nrLSU sequence data
based on maximum parsimony (MP), neighbour
joining (NJ) and Bayesian inference (MCMC) resulted
in the same tree topology (Figs 2–3, NJ not shown).
Furthermore, all four runs of MCMC-analyses yielded
identical tree topologies. Members of the genus Phrag-
midium appear as a monophyletic group with 64 and
72% bootstrap support (MP and NJ, respectively)
and 99% a posteriori probability.
The observed rose-parasitizing rust fungi P. mucro-
natum and P. tuberculatum were not monophyletic.
While P. mucronatum grouped with P. fusiforme,
mainly occurring in the Alps, andP. montivagum patho-
genic on North American wild roses (both bootstrap
and a posteriori probability of 100%), P. tuberculatum
appeared as the sister taxon to four Phragmidium
species living on either Rubus fruticosus aggr., R.
idaeus, Sanguisorba minor or Potentilla sterilis (sup-
ported by 83% bootstrap and 76% a posteriori prob-
ability). The 5k-regions of the nrLSU of all investigated
specimens of Phragmidium tuberculatum were ident-
ical, with P. mucronatum diﬀering from P. tuberculatum
in 8–9% of the 527 characters of the alignment. In
P. mucronatum, seven of the ten sequenced specimens
were identical, with the other specimens diﬀering
from them and from each other in about 1% of the
examined nucleotides. These were the collections U2,
T10, and T15.
DISCUSSION
Species delimitation and phylogeny
On the three most common dog roses in Germany
(Rosa canina,R. corymbifera,R. rubiginosa) we detected
only Phragmidium mucronatum and P. tuberculatum.
While P. rosae-pimpinellifoliae has been recorded
from R. canina and R. rubiginosa, the mainly alpine
P. fusiforme has not been observed on any of the here
studied dog roses (Ga¨umann 1959).
It had been stated that the morphological features of
the European rose rusts were partly overlapping which
questions the data given on their host range. However,
we found that species determination of P. mucronatum
andP. tuberculatum based on both aecio- and teliospore
features according to Ga¨umann (1959) was unambigu-
ously reproducible between diﬀerent members of our
samples. Since species determination is easiest if both
species are available for comparative microscopy, the
unexpectedly large diﬀerences in the LSU sequences
will prove helpful as additional characters for species
determination in future. Interestingly, sequences of
some P. mucronatum specimens diﬀered slightly from
the majority of specimens of that species. However,
no morphological diﬀerences could be detected, and
further investigations will be necessary to decide
whether there are cryptic species in this taxon.
Due to the overlapping host ranges of P. tubercula-
tum and P. mucronatum and their strong morphological
resemblance (Sydow & Sydow 1915), we expected also
a close phylogenetic relationship between them. How-
ever, this assumption was not reﬂected by the phylo-
genetic reconstructions because P. mucronatum
grouped within a clade comprising P. fusiforme and the
North American P. montivagum, while P. tuberculatum
was a sister group to European Rubus- and Sangui-
sorba-rusts (Figs 2–3). Thus, we suggest the existence
of a core rose rust clade on the one hand, and a host
jump from a predecessor of P. tuberculatum that had
lived on Rubus or Sanguisorba to Rosa on the other.

also contradict subgeneric delineations based on the
structure of teliospore pedicels (Arthur 1906, ﬁde
Ga¨umann 1959), being hygroscopic (subgenus Earlea)
or ﬁrm (subgenus Euphragmidium), as well as the host
genus-speciﬁc ‘Formenkreise’ of Ga¨umann (1959).
The sequence divergences in the D1/D2 region of
the nrLSU of Phragmidium as a whole, being up to
10% in some species pairs, are the highest observed
for a rust genus so far (Maier et al. 2003). This is
roughly twice as much as in other rust genera, sug-
gesting either that Phragmidium is a relatively old
genus or has an accelerated substitution rate. Support
for the ﬁrst explanation is provided by Phragmidium
species being restricted to a relatively old host family,
the Rosaceae (Kalkmann 1988), in contrast to, for ex-
ample Puccinia which has its focus on more recently
evolved angiosperm families like Poaceae, Cyperaceae,
and Asteraceae.
Ecological infection data
Neither Phragmidium mucronatum nor P. tuberculatum
showed any infection preferences with respect to one of
the observed rose species. This results in overlapping
host ranges, as summarized by Ga¨umann (1959), who
stated broad host ranges for both species including also
non-dog roses. These wide host ranges might be a
consequence of the putative hybridisation of dog roses
after the last ice age (Grant 1971). Similar hypotheses
to explain broad host ranges which are rather unusual
for the rusts were formulated for cereal and grass rusts
(Savile & Urban 1982, Urban & Markova´ 1984), and it
has been assumed that hybridisation of hosts can form
a bridge for parasites, enabling them to infect paternal
lineages as well as hybrids (Floate & Whitham 1993).
That P. tuberculatum was only half as frequent as P.
mucronatum might be explained by the distinct phylo-
genetic history of the two rusts. It can be speculated
that P. tuberculatum, which evolved from the Rubus-
Sanguisorba rust clade might be less adapted to Rosa as
compared to P. mucronatum which is in the rose rust
clade and most likely shares a longer adaptational or
coevolutionary history with its rose hosts. However,
phylogenetic host data and quantitative data on infec-
tion severity (rust pustules per leaf surface) derived
from laboratory-based experiments will be needed to
test this hypothesis.
The observation that R. rubiginosa was infected sig-
niﬁcantly less frequently in nature than the other in-
vestigated rose species might somehow be correlated
with the conspicuously scented glands producing a
sticky epicuticular secretion on the leaf surface. Further-
more, we detected that R. corymbifera, a species with a
hairy lower leaf surface, was infected as frequently as
the glabrous R. canina. The result that the presence of
trichomes has no inﬂuence on rust infection corre-
sponds also with the ﬁndings of Rubiales & Niks (1992)
who found no correlation between the presence of
hair in Hordeum species and rust infection. Besides leaf
surface, another and maybe more important parameter
inﬂuencing the infection patterns of the investigated
rust fungi might be the relative frequency of the rose
species in the sample area, since Rosa canina and
R. corymbifera are more frequent than R. rubiginosa in
Europe (Kurrto et al. 2004). With a rather lax growth
habit these two species occur on dry grasslands,
meadows and pastures as well as in hedges and forest
belts, whereas the rather thermophilous R. rubiginosa
with its more condensed growth habit is found mainly
in open areas. It seems plausible that the wind-
distributed rust fungi might be best adapted to the most
frequent rose species.
The lack of any obvious niche diﬀerentiation of the
two Phragmidium species and the putative host jump of
P. tuberculatum to Rosa contradicts a priori assump-
tions on strict cospeciation of speciﬁc rust-plant inter-
actions. A similar exception has been described for
Puccinia spp. parasitizing Arabis spp. (Roy 2001).
Furthermore, host switches within Phragmidium were
also detected by reconciliation analyses of parasite and
host trees of various genera of rust fungi infecting
Rosaceae (Jackson 2004). In that study, however, the
role of association by descent was signiﬁcant. Our cur-
rent hypothesis is that the frequent hybridisation of dog
roses in nature (Ritz & Wissemann 2003) might have
prevented host-induced speciation in the parasites
and is furthermore the cause of the wide host range of
the two observed rose rust taxa.
