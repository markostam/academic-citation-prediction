ABSTRACT
A growing body of evidence suggests that siRNA
could generate off-target effects through different
mechanisms. However, the full impact of off-target
gene regulation on phenotypic induction and accord-
ingly on data interpretation in the context of large-
scale siRNA library screen has not been reported.
Here we report on off-target gene silencing effects
observed in a large-scale knockdown experiment
designedto identifynovel regulatorsof theHIF-1path-
way. All of the three ‘top hits’ from our screen have
been demonstrated to result from off-target gene
silencing. Two of the three ‘siRNA hits’ were found
to directly trigger down-regulation of hif-1a mRNA
through a 7 nt motif, AGGCAGT, that is present in
both the hif-1a mRNA and the siRNAs. Further
analysis revealed that the generation of off-target
gene silencing via this 7 nt motif depends on the char-
acteristics of the target mRNA, including the
sequence context surrounding the complementary
region, the position of the complementary region in
the mRNA and the copy number of the complementary
region. Interestingly, the off-target siRNA against
hif-1a was also shown to trigger mRNA degradation
with high probability of other genes that possess
multiple copies of the AGGCAGT motif in the
30-untranslated region. Lessons learned from this
study will be a valuable asset to aid in designing
siRNAs with more stringent target selectivity and
improving ‘hits-follow-up’ strategies for future
large-scale knockdown experiments.
INTRODUCTION
siRNA is a powerful tool for studying the loss-of-function
phenotypes in mammalian cells. The high potency of
siRNA and its ease of use make it possible to carry out
genome-wide gene silencing experiments to gain new insight
in critical biological processes and to identify novel thera-
peutic targets (1–4). One of the perceived advantages of
using siRNA as a functional genomics tool is its ability to
silence genes in an sequence-specific manner. However, a
growing body of evidence suggests that siRNA specificity
is not absolute and off-target gene silencing can occur through
different mechanisms, including global up/down-regulation of
genes using high concentrations of siRNA (5,6), the induction
of an interferon response (7), miRNA-like translational inhibi-
tion (8–10) and mRNA degradation mediated by partial
sequence complementation (11). Some of the off-target effects
can be eliminated using lower concentrations of siRNA, while
others are preserved even when very low siRNA concentra-
tions are employed (5,6,11). Because it is difficult to predict
whether a particular siRNA will exhibit off-target effects,
for practical applications of using siRNA for systematic
knockdown experiment, one of the key questions is the full
impact of the off-target gene regulation to phenotypic induc-
tion in the context of a large-scale siRNA library screen.
Answers to this question will likely affect the interpretation
of data from the primary screen and lead to different strategies
for ‘hits-follow-up’.
HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor that consists of
HIF-1b and HIF-1a subunits. The activation of HIF-1 under
reduced oxygen pressure involves multiple steps including
reduced degradation of HIF-1a, nuclear translocation and
recruitment of cofactors such as p300/CBP. In some of
these steps such as reduced degradation, oxygen appears to
be the principle regulator (12–14). In other steps such as
cofactor binding, both oxygen-dependent and independent
mechanisms are involved. The direct involvement of HIF-1
in tumor development has been demonstrated by experimental
manipulation of HIF-1 activity in tumor xenografts. These
studies demonstrated that activation of HIF-1 promoted
tumor growth, while inhibition of HIF-1 activity delayed
tumor growth, suggesting that the HIF-1 pathway might be
a promising area of intervention for cancer therapy (12–14).

Unfortunately, extensive studies on the oxygen-dependent
regulatory pathway of HIF-1 activity thus far have failed to
reveal any obvious targets that are deemed ‘druggable’.
In order to identify novel ‘druggable’ regulators of the
HIF-1 pathway, we carried out a large-scale knockdown
experiment using a synthetic siRNA library against 507
human kinases. Here we report on the top hits obtained in
this screen. All the three ‘top hits’ are due to off-target
gene silencing. Among these, two of the ‘siRNA hits’ were
found to directly down-regulate the hif-1a mRNA through a
7 nt complementation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The siRNA library against 507 kinases
To obtain a list of reliable kinase sequences that are non-
redundant, we used the list of protein kinase from the Incyte
gene family and public domain sequences from the Protein
Kinase Resource (PKR) at the San Diego Super-Computer
Center (SDSC). A list of 799 kinase protein sequences was
obtained from the Incyte. To derive the nucleic acid sequence
of these proteins, the Incyte nucleic acid database was queried
using the program TBLASTN. By comparing the sequences,
redundant entries were removed, leaving 763 non-redundant
kinase sequences. These sequences were compared to those in
the Genbank reference sequence database (RefSeq). A total
of 319 sequences had an exact match (>95% identity over
the entire length of the sequence), 380 sequences were homo-
logous and 64 sequences were classified as unique when
compared to the sequences in the RefSeq database. From
the public domain human kinase sequence, 663 sequences
were obtained after removing multiple listings of the same
sequence, potential polymorphisms and splice variants. Of
these sequences, 250 were well characterized and were
found in the RefSeq database. The final list of kinases was
obtained by combining the Incyte (319) and public domain
(250) sequences found in RefSeq with the unique Incyte
sequences (64) to yield a total of 507 kinase sequences
after the redundancies were removed.
The siRNAs against the kinase sequences were designed
based on the rules suggested by Tuschl and co-workers (15).
Sequences containing an AA 75 nt from the start codon and
with the G/C content between 40–70% were selected. In addi-
tion, siRNAs containing stem-loop structures predicted using
the thermodynamic rules similar to those implemented in
Zucker’s RNA folding algorithm were eliminated. One
siRNA was designed for each kinase. The siRNAs were
synthesized and purified by Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colorado).
siRNA Library screening using the HIF-1 reporter assay
The HIF-1 reporter, pHRE, was constructed by inserting the
hypoxia response element (HRE) from the enolase promoter
into the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega, WI). For siRNA
library screening, the HIF-1 reporter and a control reporter,
pRL-TK (Promega, WI), were first transfected into H1299
cells grown in 10 cm plates using the Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, CA). Three hours after transfection, the
cells were trypsinized and plated into 96-well plate at 8,000
cells/well and incubated overnight to allow cells to attach and
spread. siRNAs were transfected the following day at a final
concentration of 100 nM (initial library screen) or 20 nM (in
the subsequent retest experiment) using the Lipofectamine
2000 reagent. After transfection of siRNA for 24 h, the
cells were transferred to an environment containing 2% O2
and 5% CO2 for an additional 15–18 h and then analyzed using
the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, WI). Using a
siRNA against HIF-1a as a positive control and a siRNA
irrelevant to the HIF-1 pathway as a negative control, a
z0 factor of 0.58 was obtained, indicating that the HTS
assay is very robust.
Human VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
H1299 cells grown in 96-well plate were transfected with
20 nM of indicated siRNAs for 24 h and subjected to hypoxia
treatment for an additional 15–18 h. Medium was collected
and assayed for VEGF using a human VEGF-specific ELISA
kit (R&D systems, MN).
Screen for potent shRNAs targeting GRK4,
BTK and HK1
The cDNAs encoding full-length GRK4 (NM_182982), BTK
(NM_000061) and HK1 (M75126) were cloned into the
pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen, CA) to generate expres-
sion vectors that produce V5-His tagged proteins. The shRNA
expression constructs were generated using a protocol
described previously (16). To select the most potent shRNA
for each of the targets, the expression plasmid was
co-transfected with an shRNA expression plasmid at a 1:1
ratio into H1299 cells. After post-transfection for 24 h the
cells were harvested and analyzed by western blotting using
the anti-V5 antibody. Synthetic siRNAs with identical
sequences to the most potent shRNAs were obtained from
Dharmacon and designated as new siRNAs [GRK4(N),
HK1(N) and BTK(N)].
Western blotting
For western blotting, cells were directly lysed on 6-well plates
in 1· Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Proteins were
separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane
and western blotting was performed according to standard
procedures using the mouse anti-HIF-1a mAbs (Pharmingen,
CA), the monoclonal p53 antibody (Oncogene Science, NY)
and the monoclonal b-actin antibody (Sigma, MO).
Quantitative RT–PCR (QPCR)
H1299 cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNA for 24 h and
total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,
CA). QPCR analyses was performed using the ABI-7700
Sequence Detector instrument and the Platinum Quantitative
RT–PCR ThermoScript One-Step System (Invitrogen, CA).
The ABI’s ‘Assay on demand’ primer/probe mixtures were
used for each of the following genes: hif-1a (HS00153153M1),
GRK4 (HS00178384M1), RDX (HS00267954M1), PIAS3
(HS00180666M1), PPM1F (HS00206069M1), DISC1

(HS00245443M1), RAB6IP1 (HS00383858M1) and NUP210
(HS00227779M1). Each reaction was run in triplicates. The
expression level for each sample was first normalized to the
amount of GAPDH or b-actin and then to the experimental

control. The following primer/probe sets were used for the
control genes. Human b-actin: b-actin_1316F (CTGGAACG-
GTGAAGGTGACA), b-actin_1380R (CGGCCACATTGT-
GAACTTTG) and b-actin_1337T [(FAM)CAGTCGGTTG-

Reporter assay for testing the response of
HIF-1a mutants to siRNAs
The firefly luciferase gene (luc) and DNA fragments encoding
various portions/mutations of hif-1a cDNA as illustrated in
Figure 4 were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector between NheI/
BamHI and EcoRI/NotI, respectively (Invitrogen, CA). H1299
cells grown in a 96-well plate were first transfected with
20 nM siRNA for 24 h and then transfected with various
Luc-Hif DNA constructs together with a control reporter,
pRL-SV40 (Promega, WI), for an additional 24 h. The cells
were then analyzed using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system

RESULTS
Off-target gene silencing observed in a large-scale
siRNA knockdown experiment
In order to identify novel ‘druggable’ targets that regulate the
HIF-1 signal pathway, we screened our siRNA library to
identify genes that when knocked down, inhibit the HIF-1
pathway in a cell-based reporter gene assay. A Z0 factor of
0.58 was obtained using this assay, indicating that the assay
is robust and well suited for HTS screening (data not shown).
siRNA hits were defined as positive if they reduced luciferase
activity to a value that had more than a 90% probability of
being statistically different from that of the siRNA popula-
tion in the testing plate. By screening a library of 507 siRNAs
designed against the kinase family of enzymes using this
reporter assay, we identified 83 siRNAs that down-
regulated the HIF-1 reporter under hypoxic conditions.
After eliminating siRNAs that behaved like general transcrip-
tional inhibitors through a counter-screen using a constitutive
reporter, pGL3-control, the remaining siRNA ‘hits’ were fur-
ther characterized for their abilities to inhibit the production
of the HIF-1 target, VEGF. Results from these studies
revealed that siRNAs against GRK4, BTK and HK1
exhibited >40% inhibition of the HIF-1 reporter activity
and the VEGF production under hypoxia without affecting
the activity of the pGL3-control reporter, suggesting that
these genes are involved in the hypoxia response mediated
by HIF-1.
To ensure that the observed results were target related,
several additional siRNAs against each of the targets were
obtained and the correlation between the degree of target
knockdown and the degree of inhibition of the HIF-1 reporter
by each of the siRNAs was examined. Most of the additional
siRNAs that we obtained failed to exhibit strong inhibition on
the HIF-1 reporter activity. However, these siRNAs also
caused less target knockdown compared to the original
siRNAs in the kinase siRNA library (data not shown), sug-
gesting that either a more complete knockdown of the target is
required to affect the HIF-1 pathway or the phenotypes
observed using the original siRNAs are due to an off-target
effect. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we iden-
tified siRNAs that were able to knockdown the target to a
higher degree than the original siRNA by screening a panel
of shRNAs for their abilities to knockdown each target (data
not shown). GRK4(N) and HK1(N), the siRNAs that are based
on the most potent shRNA sequences against GRK4 and HK1,
were found to be more efficient than the original siRNAs in
knocking down these targets at both the endogenous mRNA
level and the level of exogenously introduced epitope tagged
proteins (Figure 1A and B, left and middle panels). However,
none of these new siRNAs was able to inhibit the HIF-1
reporter activity under hypoxia (Figure 1A and B, right panels),
demonstrating that the inhibition of the HIF-1 pathway by the
original GRK4 and HK1 siRNAs was due to off-target effects.
Similarly, the new BTK siRNA, BTK(N), knocked down a
transiently expressed BTK protein to a higher degree than
the orignal BTK siRNA, BTK(O) (Figure 1C, middle panel), but
failed to inhibit the HIF-1 reporter activity under hypoxia
(Figure 1C, right panel). In addition, QPCR analysis failed
to detect any BTK mRNA in the cells that were used in the
siRNA library screen (data not shown), which provided further
evidence that the observed inhibition on the HIF-1 pathway by
BTK(O) is an off-target effect. Taken together, all of the three
‘top hits’ from screening a library of 507 siRNAs were resulted
from the off-target effects of siRNAs.
A 7 nt complementation between the original GRK4(O)/
BTK(O) siRNAs and the hif-1a mRNA triggers the
degradation of hif-1a mRNA
To gain more insight on how siRNAs generate off-target
effects, we examined whether the original GRK4, BTK and
HK1 siRNAs were able to regulate HIF-1a directly. Down-
regulation of HIF-1a by the original GRK4 and BTK siRNAs
was observed at both the protein and the mRNA levels, sug-
gesting that these siRNAs might directly target the hif-1a
mRNA (Figure 2A and B). Sequence analysis revealed the
presence in the 30-untranslated region (30-UTR) of the hif-
1a mRNA of two copies of a 7 nt motif complementary to
2–8 nt at the 50 end of the antisense strands of the original
GRK4 and BTK siRNAs (Figure 3A). This suggests that these
two siRNAs might target hif-1a mRNA in these regions. To
determine whether the 7 nt region is responsible for the off-
target effect of the original GRK4 siRNA, an siRNA with 1 nt
mutated in the 7 nt region was tested for its ability to knock-
down HIF-1a [Figure 3A, GRK4(M)]. This mutated siRNA,
GRK4(M), failed to decrease HIF-1a at the mRNA or protein
levels or exhibit any inhibitory effects on the HIF-1 reporter
activity (Figure 3B–D), indicating that the 7 nt region in the
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 14 4529
original GRK4 siRNA was responsible for the observed off-
target effect. Similar results were also obtained using
BTK(M), a siRNA with a 1 nt mutation in the 7 nt motif of
the original BTK siRNA (data not shown), suggesting that the
same 7 nt motif is also critical for the off-target silencing of
HIF-1a by the original BTK siRNA.
To distinguish whether the down-regulation of HIF-1a by
GRK4(O) is due to direct targeting of the hif-1a mRNA or
indirect targeting of an unknown HIF-1 regulator, we created a
panel of luciferase reporters by inserting different forms of the
hif-1 a mRNA downstream of the coding sequence of luci-
ferase [Figure 4, Luc, Luc-HIF-1a(ORF), Luc-HIF-1a(FL)
and Luc-HIF-1a(30UTR)]. A siRNA that targets the inserted
hif-1a mRNA would be expected to degrade the luciferase
mRNA produced from these constructs and lead to a reduction
in luciferase activity. The original GRK4 siRNA was found to
cause a reduction of luciferase activities when the reporters
contain the 30-UTR of the hif-1a mRNA [Figure 5A,
GRK4(O), Luc-HIF-1a(30UTR) and Luc-HIF-1a(FL)]. In
contrast, no reduction of luciferase activities was observed
when the reporters only contain the coding region of the
hif-1a mRNA [Figure 5A, GRK4(O), Luc-HIF-1a(ORF)].
As a control, a HIF-1a siRNA that targets the coding region
of the hif-1a mRNA caused inhibition on the Luc-
HIF-1a(ORF) and Luc-HIF-1a(FL) reporters, but had no
effect on the other two reporters (Figure 5A, HIF-1a).
These results support that GRK4(O) may directly target the
30-UTR of the hif-1a mRNA. However, it is still possible that
GRK4(O) might down-regulate the hif-1a mRNA indirectly
through knocking down an unknown protein that interacts
with the two 7 nt motifs and stabilize the hif-1a mRNA in
cells. To provide additional support of the hypothesis that
the two 7 nt motifs in the hif-1a mRNA were responsi-
ble for GRK4(O)-induced gene silencing, we mutated the

the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The expression of GRK4 was determined by QPCR 24 h after transfection. The middle panel: H1299 cells were first transfected with
a plasmid encoding a V5-tagged GRK4, then transfected with the indicated siRNAs 24 h later. The cells were collected 24 h after siRNA transfection and analyzed by
western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody. Right panel: H1299 cells were first transfected with the dual reporters, pHRE and pRL-TK, then transfected with the
indicated siRNAs. Hypoxia treatment was initiated 24 h after siRNA transfection and the cells were collected 12–18 h later for analysis using the Dual-Glo luciferase
assay. (B) The effects of the control siRNA, HK1(O) and HK1(N) on the mRNA and protein levels HK1 and the HIF-1 reporter activities were examined as in the left,
middle and right panels of (A). A plasmid encoding a V5-tagged HK1 was used for the experiment presented in the middle panel. (C) The effects of the control siRNA,
BTK(O) and BTK(N) on the protein level of BTK and the HIF-1 reporter activities were determined as in the middle and right panels of (A). A plasmid encoding a V5-
tagged BTK was used for the experiment presented in the left panel. In all experiments, the siRNA were transfected using a final concentration of 20 nM. The original
GRK4, HK1 and BTK siRNAs were designated as GRK4(O), HK1(O) and BTK(O). The new GRK4, HK1 and BTK siRNAs were designated as GRK4(N), HK1(N)
and BTK(N). Con and HIF-1a represent the control siRNA and the HIF-1a siRNA, respectively.

HIF-1a(30UTR) reporter to disrupt the two 7 nt box individu-
ally or in combination [Figure 5B, HIF-1a(30UTR)m1,
HIF-1a(30UTR)m2 and HIF-1a(30UTR)m3]. Mutations that
disrupted both boxes were found to completely block the
ability of GRK4(O) to inhibit the reporter [Figure 5B,
GRK4(O), HIF-1a(30UTR)m3], suggesting that the two 7 nt
box in the HIF-1a mRNA are the targeting sites of GRK4(O).
Compared to the reporter with both boxes disrupted, the
reporters with either one of the regions mutated exhibited
partial resistance to GRK4(O)-induced inhibition, indicating
that the two boxes function independently in an additive man-
ner [Figure 5B, GRK4(O), HIF-1a(30UTR)m1 and HIF-
1a(30UTR)]. Similar results were also observed using the ori-
ginal BTK siRNA (data not shown), indicating that both
BTK(O) and GRK4(O) target hif-1a mRNA at the same
sites with similar mechanisms.
Because the two 7 nt boxes in the HIF-1a mRNA are in
close vicinity, we examined whether the distance between the
two boxes would affect the off-target gene silencing by

was found that moving the box1 upstream 200 or 400 bp
did not affect the degree of silencing induced by GRK4(O)
and moving the box1 downstream 200 or 400 bp only caused a
slight reduction of silencing (Figure 5C). These results suggest
that the space between the two 7 nt boxes is not a critical
determinant of the silencing efficiency. We next examined the
impact of the sequences surrounding the two boxes in the
hif-1a mRNA on GRK4(O)-mediated silencing. A 50 bp
fragment spanning the two 7 nt boxes from the hif-1a
30-UTR was inserted into the Luc-HIF-1a(ORF) reporter to
generate the Luc-HIF-1a(ORF)Box1/2 reporter [Figure 4,
Luc-HIF-1a(ORF)Box1/2]. In this reporter, the distance
from the stop codon of the luciferase coding sequence to
the two 7 nt boxes was kept the same as in the HIF-
1a(30UTR) reporter. Surprisingly, GRK4(O) failed to exhibit
any inhibitory effect on the Luc-HIF-1a(ORF)Box1/2 reporter
(Figure 5D), suggesting that silencing by GRK4(O) is depend-
ent on the sequences surrounding the box1 and box2 of the
hif-1a mRNA.

Figure 4. Schematics of luciferase reporters contain different fragments/mutations of the hif-1a mRNA. The luciferase coding region is black colored. The hif-1a
mRNA is gray colored. ‘TGA’ is the stop codon of the hif-1a mRNA (2763–2765 nt). The numbers are based on the hif-1a mRNA entry NM_001530. The black
boxes represent the two 7 nt boxes, Hif1Box1 and Hif1Box2. Luc-Hif-1a (ORF), Luc-Hif-1a (FL), Luc-Hif-1a (30UTR) contain the open reading frame of the
hif-1amRNA, the full-length hif-1amRNA (from the start ATG to the end) and the 30-UTR of the hif-1amRNA, respectively. Luc-Hif-1a (30UTR)m1, Luc-Hif-1a
(30UTR)m2 and Luc-Hif-1a (30UTR)m3 contain mutations that disrupt the first, second or both 7 nt boxes in the 30-UTR of the hif-1a mRNA. In Luc-Hif-1a
(30UTR)Box1U200, Luc-Hif-1a (30UTR)Box1U400, Luc-Hif-1a (30UTR)Box1D200 and Luc- Hif1a (30UTR)Box1D400, the first 7 nt box, HifBox1, was moved
upstream 200–400 bp, or downstream 200–400 bp from its original position. In the Luc-Hif-1a (ORF)Box1/2 reporter, a 50 bp fragment spanning the two 7 nt boxes in
the hif-1a 30-UTR was inserted into the hif-1a open reading frame. The distance from the stop codon of the luciferase coding sequence to the two 7 nt boxes was kept
the same in the Luc-Hif-1a(ORF)Box1/2 reporter as in the Luc-Hif-1a (30UTR) reporter.

Off-target silencing of multiple endogenous
genes by the GRK4(O) siRNA
Because gene silencing mediated by the 7 nt boxes in
GRK4(O) appeared to be dependent on the sequence context
in the target, we next examined whether GRK4(O) could
silence genes other than HIF-1a that also possess multiple
copies of the 7 nt motif, AGGCAGT. A BLAST analysis
using AGGCAGT against human RefSeq identified 726
genes with more than one copy of the 7 nt motif in the coding
region and 486 genes with more than one copy of this motif in
the 30-UTR. Eight genes with multiple copies of the
AGGCAGT sequence in the coding region or 30-UTR were
selected for QPCR analysis of gene knockdown by GRK4(O).
Two out of the four genes with the AGGCAGT motif in
30-UTR exhibited more than a 40% reduction of mRNA
upon the transfection of GRK4(O) but not GRK4(N)
(Figure 6, PPM1F and DISC1). One of the four genes with
the 7 nt motif in 30-UTR was down-regulated by both
GRK4(O) and GRK4(N) (Figure 6, RDX), suggesting that
this gene might happen to be a GRK4 regulated gene. In
contrast, none of the four genes with the targeting sites in
the coding region were inhibited by GRK4(O) (Figure 6,
NDUFS1, ABL1, RAB6IP1 and NUP210). These results sug-
gest that genes with multiple partial complementary sites in
the 30-UTR to 2–8 nt of the antisense strand of a siRNA have a
good probability of being silenced. However, not every gene
with similar complementary sites in 30-UTR will be silenced,
as demonstrated by the lack of PIAS3 knockdown by
GRK4(O) (Table 1, PIAS3).
DISCUSSION
Although siRNA-mediated off-target effects have been repor-
ted, the extent of the off-target effect is generally believed to
be relatively small. Therefore, it was surprising to find that all
of the ‘top hits’ from our screen were due to off-target effects
of the siRNAs. A probable explanation is that the screening
process enriches siRNAs that produce a particular phenotype.
Owing to the large number of siRNAs in the library, the small
off-target effects of the siRNAs are amplified, leading to a
large percentage of off-target ‘hits’ in the screening. Reducing
the siRNA concentration in the screen is insufficient to alle-
viate the off-target effects. In our hands, all of the off-target
‘hits’ inhibited the HIF-1 pathway at a concentration as low as
5 nM. Therefore, verifying the hits with multiple siRNAs and
using non-RNAi-based methods such as rescuing the pheno-
type with a siRNA resistant mutant of the target are absolutely
critical. In addition, due to the large percentage of the off-
target hits generated in the screening, using a redundant library
without pooling in the primary screen could significantly
reduce the efforts required to eliminate off-target false posit-
ives and therefore, will be a more efficient design than using a
pooled library.
It is intriguing that a 7 nt complementation between the
siRNA and the target is sufficient to cause gene silencing.
Although the silencing effect is relatively weak with the pres-
ence of only one partially complementary site, the presence of
multiple sites appears to amplify the silencing effect. Another
finding from our study is that sequences surrounding the
siRNA targeting sites are also important for the silencing

Figure 5. Responses of HIF-1amutants to gene silencing induced by GRK4(O). (A)–(D) H1299 cells were first transfected with indicated siRNAs and the indicated
luciferase reporter variants were transfected together with the pRL-SV40 reporter 24 h after siRNA transfection. The cells were collected and analyzed 18 h later for
luciferase activity using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system. In all experiments, siRNAs were transfected at a final concentration of 20 nM. Con, Luc, HIF-1a and
GRK4(O) represent the control siRNA, the siRNA against luciferase, HIF-1a and the original GRK4 siRNA, respectively.

effect. This is contradictory to what was found using perfectly
matched siRNAs. It has been suggested that the silencing
potency of a perfectly matched siRNA is largely determined
by the thermodynamic property of its primary sequence but not
the secondary or tertiary structure of its mRNA target (17,18).
The context-dependent silencing mediated by partial comple-
mentation between a siRNA and its unintended targets makes
it more difficult to predict the off-target effect of a given
siRNA.
The possibility for siRNAs to trigger gene silencing with
very limited complementation has been suggested in the
expression profiling study carried out by Jackson et al. (11),
in which, the expression of a small set of genes was down-
regulated with similar kinetics to MAPK14 and several of
these potentially off-target regulated genes were found to
have sequence identity to the MAPK14 siRNA only at
12–18 nt of the sense strand (equivalent to 2–8 nt of the
antisense strand). Our results are consistent with Jackson
et al. in which we have shown that a 7 nt complementation
between a siRNA and a target is necessary and in many cases
sufficient to cause mRNA degradation of the target.
The position of sequence complementation between
GRK4(O)/BTK(O) or the MAPK14 siRNAs and their unin-
tended targets remarkably resembles the sequence comple-
mentation between miRNAs and their targets. The 50 ends
of many miRNAs have been shown to contain a 7 nt sequence
that are complementary to several classes of sequence motifs
known to mediate negative post-transcriptional regulation
(19–21). In addition, one of the common features of the
GRK4(O)/BTK(O) siRNAs and the MAPK14 siRNA used
in Jackson’s study is the high G/C content at positions 2–8
of the antisense strand, suggesting a high thermodynamic sta-
bility of this region. This is also consistent with a recent report
that miRNAs with high thermodynamic stability at the 50
region is sufficient to inhibit the translation of their targets
without any extensive complementation at the 30 region (22).
The ability of siRNAs to enter the miRNA pathway to inhibit a
target on the translation level has been reported (9,10). Inter-
estingly, in this study the GRK4(O)/BTK(O) siRNAs triggers
off-target mRNA down-regulation instead of translation
inhibition. It was recently reported that some miRNAs
down-regulate large numbers of target mRNAs, which indic-
ates that miRNAs can also regulate their biological targets at
the mRNA level (23). In addition, Jing et al. recently reported
that miRNA together with the RISC complex can associate
with proteins that are involved in modulating mRNA stability.
Therefore, it is conceivable that the off-target siRNA could
behave like a miRNA to interact with its undesired target
through the 7 nt motif, which may result in the recruitment
of the RISC complex to the target mRNA and subsequently
the recruitment of proteins that are involved in regulating
mRNA stability (24). Taken together, we speculate that the
GRK4(O)/BTK(O) siRNAs might adopt the same mode of
action as a miRNA to interact with and down-regulate the
mRNA of its unintended target, HIF-1a. Considering the
importance of thermodynamic stability in the 50 region of a
miRNA for target recognition, it might be possible to improve
the selectivity of siRNA by choosing siRNAs with lower
thermodynamic stability at the 50 region of the antisense
strand. On the other hand, since a partial complementation
between a siRNA and the 30-UTR of a gene appeared to
trigger off-target silencing with high probability, designing
siRNAs with minimal complementation to the 30-UTR of all
the genes in the genome will also likely improve the specificity
of siRNA.
