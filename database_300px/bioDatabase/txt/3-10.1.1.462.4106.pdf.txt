Abstract The degree of UV protection afforded by
nano-ZnO in a polyurethane/acrylic clear topcoat was
investigated. The influence of nano-ZnO concentration
and dry film thickness on the optical properties (e.g.,
UV permeability and visible transmittance) of the
coating was probed using a library of 28 samples that
were prepared by high throughput techniques. A
model for predicting the UV permeability of nano-
ZnO filled coatings was developed and the nano-ZnO
loading condition required to block >99% UV radia-
tion was determined to be 2.0 g/m2. This model can be
used to assist in the development of coatings and other
polymeric systems embedded with nano-ZnO to pro-
tect the coating and underlying materials (i.e., sub-
strate) from UV degradation.

Introduction
A common failure mechanism for organic coatings is
photodegradation due to UV exposure.1–5 In order to
minimize such failures, coatings that are exposed to
UV during their service life are formulated with UV
resistant polymers, such as acrylics and aliphatic
polyurethanes. Coatings used in more demanding
applications, such as automotive, aerospace, and exte-
rior wood, also contain additives which absorb UV to
assist in protection. These additives not only protect
the coating, but they can also protect the substrate,
which may be vulnerable to UV degradation (e.g.,
wood, plastics, and textiles). Typically, these additives
are included in coating formulations at concentrations
of <5%. Some of the more common chemical classes of
organic UV absorbers are benzophenones, benzotriaz-
oles, triazines, malonates, and oxalanilides. However,
due to their relatively low molecular weight, these
additives can migrate out of applied coatings, either to
the coating surface or into the substrate.6–8 Also,
because they are organic, they are susceptible to a
number of degradation mechanisms.
Many metal oxides also are known to absorb UV
radiation; the most common of these are zinc oxide
(ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2). With the acceler-
ated development of nano-particle technology, nano-
particle ZnO has the ability to offer UV protection to
coatings and underlying substrates while also being
transparent in the visible spectrum. Particles with
particle size less than 100 nm can be included into a
polymer matrix (e.g., coatings) to yield visibly transpar-
ent materials.9,10 The transparency is possible due to the
particle size being considerably less than the wave-
lengths of visible light (400–800 nm). As a result, nano-
ZnO particles have become an option as a formulating
material for UV protection. Due to the fact that they are
inorganic and particulate, they have added advantages
of being stable and nonmigratory within an applied
coating, thus allowing them to potentially offer better
effectiveness and a longer service life.
Empirical work has illustrated the effectiveness of
nano-ZnO particles as UV absorbers in coatings.11 In
many applications, it is essential to have complete UV
absorption. One such example is clear topcoats that are
applied to protect underlying substrates (e.g., clear-
coats over UV-sensitive epoxy basecoats). Parameters
that affect UV absorption in these cases are the

concentration of nano-ZnO and the dry film thickness
of the applied coating; in effect, this is the concentra-
tion of nano-ZnO per area of applied, dry coating.
Theoretically, this should be predictable using Beer–
Lambert’s Law to determine the dependence of sample
path length (i.e., dry film thickness) and absorbent
concentration (e.g., wt% ZnO) on UV absorption.
Given that this calculation relies on the extinction
coefficient (e) of the absorbent, and, so, empirical
testing at multiple ZnO concentrations and film thick-
nesses is required to determine the value of e before
any predictions can be made.
The objective of this work was to determine the
relationship between nano-ZnO concentration, dry
film thickness, UV absorption, and visible transmit-
tance (haze) in a clear topcoat. Due to the large
number of samples that were required to assess these
relationships, and the time-consuming process associ-
ated with sample preparation, high throughput tech-
niques were employed to expedite the preparation and
characterization of a broad set of materials.
The concept of high throughput research refers to
employing techniques that will increase the rate of
experimentation on a per-labor-hour basis; this philos-
ophy has spilled over into the chemicals and materials
industries and has gained significant momentum with
respect to the coatings industry in recent years. Several
comprehensive reviews of the role of high throughput
experimentation (HTE) in coatings research have
appeared in the literature.12–15 In the present work,
HTE facilitated the process of coating formulation and
film casting and, in so doing, enabled the observation
of a broader set of experimental variables than would
have been achievable using conventional methods in
the same amount of time.
Experimental
Materials, formulations, and sample preparation
The premix recipe for a clearcoat resin containing a
polyurethane/acrylic polymer (Hybridur 570, HY570) is
depicted in Table 1. Coating formulations were pre-
pared according to the information provided in Table 2
using a liquid handling instrument* with the clearcoat
resin and a nano-ZnO dispersion. The 0 wt% sample
represents pure clearcoat resin and, thus, was considered
to be a control for transparent coatings. Sample con-
centrations were determined on the basis of wt% ZnO
solids on polymer (HY570) solids. In order to ensure
uniformity, the nano-ZnO dispersion was shaken vigor-
ously for 1 min prior to loading on the sample deck of the
liquid handling instrument. Homogeneous mixtures
were produced in parallel via magnetic stirring
(5 min). Films (15 · 25 mm) of the homogenous for-
mulations were cast on glass microscope slides
(75 · 25 · 1 mm) at application thicknesses (bwet) of
1, 4.5, 8.5, and 11 mil using high-throughput film
deposition techniques. A separate control (0 wt% for-
mulation) was prepared at each thickness for continuity.
The resulting 28 films were air dried under ambient
conditions for 24 h prior to analysis.
Sample characterization
Dry film thickness
The dry film thickness (bdry) of each sample was
measured using a micrometer. Measurements were
performed prior to film deposition (bblank slide, i.e.,
blank glass slide) and again 24 h after film deposition
(bslide + film, i.e., glass slide plus dry film). The dry film

Spectroscopic investigation
UV spectra were collected for each sample using a
Cary 300 UV–Vis spectrophotometer equipped with a
solid sample holder and photomultiplier tube (PMT)
detector. Samples were scanned from 200 to 800 nm at
1 nm increments.
Results and discussion
A set of 28 samples (7 coating formulations · 4 film
thicknesses) were prepared in a relatively short period
of time (<1 h manual labor) with minimal material
expenditure (<50 g raw materials). The samples were
then used to investigate the relationship among nano-
ZnO loading in the applied, dry coating, and UV
permeability.
Dry film thickness
The dry film thickness for each sample was measured
at three locations using a micrometer (±0.1 mil accu-
racy). By averaging the measured data points for each
sample and comparing across different samples, a
linear relationship between application thickness and
dry film thickness was revealed (Fig. 1). Interestingly,
no dependence between nano-ZnO concentration and
dry film thickness was observed. This observation
suggests that dry film thickness is controlled by the
clearcoat resin and, further, that the nano-ZnO parti-
cles are well dispersed in the starting material, the
formulated samples, and the films. The well-dispersed
nature of nano-ZnO particles in the applied coating is
supported by SEM (Fig. 2). By comparison, poorly
dispersed systems would have resulted in the formation
of hazy, nonuniform films due to particle aggregation
and flocculation.
As can be seen in Fig. 1, the ‘‘shrinkage ratio’’ (i.e.,
the ratio of dry film thickness to application thickness)
for these samples was determined to be 16%, which
matches the value that was obtained for similar
coatings prepared by conventional methods. Accord-
ingly, this value can be used to validate the high
throughput methods that were used to prepare the
samples and, further, could be used to approximate the
dry film thickness of most similar coatings according to
their application thickness.
Spectral interpretation
UV–Vis spectra were collected for each sample and
plotted in terms of the fraction of light that was
transmitted through the film (percent transmission,
%T). Two generic spectra are presented in Fig. 3,
representing a blank clearcoat film and a nano-ZnO-
containing coating at equivalent thicknesses. Both

dry film thickness are linearly related with a shrinkage ratio

spectra exhibit high transmission through the visible
region (i.e., films are transparent and clear) as well as a
sharp drop in transmission around 300 nm, which
corresponds to absorption by the glass substrate.
A distinguishing feature of the nano-ZnO-containing
films is a drop in transmission around 370 nm, which
corresponds to the absorption of UV radiation by
nano-ZnO particles (Egap = 368 nm) and is indicative
of the UV protecting ability of the film.
For coatings applications, the extent of UV protec-
tion depends on nano-ZnO loading. As such, the role
of nano-ZnO concentration and film thickness with
respect to blocking UV transmission was explored and
will be discussed below.
ZnO loading and UV protection
The term ‘‘nano-ZnO loading’’ is used here to describe
the level of nano-ZnO that is present per coverage area
in a dry coating (i.e., g ZnO/m2 coating coverage). It
follows, then, that this value can be adjusted through
the concentration of nano-ZnO in the wet formulation
or by the volume of material that is deposited on a
substrate (e.g., film thickness). The present study was
designed to identify and quantify the nano-ZnO
loading level required for complete UV protection.
The comprehensive set of 28 samples was charac-
terized using UV–Vis spectroscopy and the resulting
transmission spectra are presented in Fig. 4 as a
function of nano-ZnO concentration and application
thickness. As expected, UV transmission decreases (or,
conversely, the degree of UV protection increases) as

The extent to which UV radiation is blocked will depend on
the amount of nano-ZnO present in an applied coating,
which, in turn, can be regulated by concentration and film
thickness

nano-ZnO loading increases. Similarly, all of the
applied coatings remain transparent to visible light
with little-to-no sign of pigmentation or discoloration
(i.e., all films are clear and colorless relative to
controls). Optical haze was separately measured for a
subset of these materials using standard ASTM meth-
ods. All of the tested materials express low haze and
their optical clarity is comparable to that of analogous
Tinuvin UVA/HALS.16 For instance, 4 wt% formula-
tion at bwet » 7–8 mil expresses 0.11% haze and 7 wt%
formulation at bwet » 7–8 mil expresses 1.3% haze.
By comparing these data with the results of a
conventional UV exposure experiment (Fig. 5),* the
requirements for complete UV protection can be eluci-
dated. As can clearly be seen in Fig. 5, 7 wt% ZnO
outperforms 4 wt% ZnO and both of these concentra-
tions significantly outperform the ‘‘control’’ (0 wt%
ZnO) at equivalent thicknesses (bwet » 7–8 mil).
Figure 6a suggests that 4 wt% ZnO transmits ~5% UV
radiation at this application thickness, whereas Fig. 6b
(6, 8 wt% ZnO) suggests that 7 wt% ZnO transmits
<1% UV. Due to the fact that the 7 wt% ZnO coating
affords near perfect protection (i.e., little-to-no color-
change in the epoxy underlayer, Fig. 5b), the criterion
for complete UV protection is defined as <1% UV
transmission. It is worth noting that the 4 wt% ZnO
coating also performs very well (i.e., 95% protection)
and may be appropriate for some applications, but that
the goal of this work is to target nano-ZnO loading
conditions that will consistently deliver complete UV
protection.
Beer–Lambert’s Law
In order to gain improved understanding of the
influence of nano-ZnO loading on UV protection, a
model for predicting UV transmission was established
using Beer–Lambert’s Law (2)17 in conjunction with
Beer’s Law (3)18:
A ¼ log10ð100=%TÞ ð2Þ
where %T = percent transmission; A = absorption.
A ¼ e bdry c ð3Þ
where e = extinction coefficient (constant associated
with the absorbent; mil–1 wt%–1); bdry = dry film
thickness (mil); c = nano-ZnO concentration (wt%).
Using the observed spectroscopic data, the nano-ZnO
extinction coefficient (e) was calculated to be
0.279 mil–1 wt%–1. Substituting for e and using
algebra to combine equations (2) and (3):
%T ¼ 10ð20:279 b cÞ ð4Þ
The resulting equation (4) can be used to calculate
percent transmission at a given wavelength according
to any set of nano-ZnO loading parameters (dry film
thickness and nano-ZnO concentration).
Predictions were made for the full set of 28 samples
and compared against the experimentally determined
values; a plot of predicted transmission vs. measured
transmission is presented in Fig. 7. The correlation
among these data sets is very strong (R2 = 0.97). Due
to the fact that the slope is not equal to 1 (the ideal
case), however, a linear correction factor (f) must be
applied to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The
updated equation, then, becomes:
%T ¼ f 10ð20:279 b cÞ ð5Þ
where f = [1/slope of ‘‘Actual % Transmission’’ vs.
‘‘Predicted % Transmission’’ curve] (Fig. 7).
Using this model, it is possible to predict UV
transmission according to nano-ZnO concentration

and dry film thickness and, more importantly, to
determine the appropriate loading parameters for
<1% UV transmission. A plot of loading parameters
that will afford complete UV protection in the oper-
ating range of film thicknesses for many applications in
the coatings industry {0.1 mil < bdry < 2.0 mil} is de-
picted in Fig. 8. As expected, the relationship between
concentration and thickness is hyperbolic such that
high nano-ZnO concentration is coupled with low film
thickness and vice versa.
Taking the various combinations of loading param-
eters into consideration, it is possible to calculate the
quantity of nano-ZnO per surface area that is required
to give complete UV protection. As shown in Table 3,
optimal nano-ZnO loading is in the range of {1.9–
2.1 g/m2}. This value suggests that the nano-ZnO
particles provide excellent UV protection per surface
area and that the nano-ZnO particles are well dis-
persed in the dried coating.

Conclusions
The UV protecting ability of films containing nano-
ZnO embedded in a polyurethane/acrylic clearcoat
resin was probed as a function of nano-ZnO concen-
tration and dry film thickness. Given the labor-inten-
sive process associated with sample formulation and
film casting, high throughput techniques were utilized
to accelerate this work. Through the use of these (and
similar techniques), the batch sample size can be
significantly increased (i.e., over an order of magni-
tude) with relatively little effect on the time domain
associated with sample preparation (especially when
compared against the time associated with conven-
tional methodology).
The spectroscopic data that were collected herein
support the previous finding that, at equivalent thick-
nesses, 7 wt% ZnO outperforms 4 wt% ZnO in terms
of UV protection and, further, that even slight differ-
ences in the UV permeability of a film (e.g., 5%
transmission vs. <1% transmission) may have a dra-
matic effect on its extended UV protection perfor-
mance. A model for predicting UV transmission
according to nano-ZnO loading was established and
optimal loading conditions were determined to be 2.0 g
nano-ZnO/m2.
The uniform thickness of all films that were gener-
ated in this experiment coupled with the low level of
haze and UV transmission lend credence to the notion
that the nano-ZnO particles are well dispersed in the
applied, dry coatings. The greater implication of this
work is that nearly complete UV protection can be
afforded in nano-ZnO filled coatings using relatively
low doses of dispersed ZnO nanoparticles, and, further,
that the optical behavior of these materials obeys
standard spectroscopic theory and enables accurate
prediction of their protection performance a priori.
