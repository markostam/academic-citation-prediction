Abstract
Histologic grading of breast cancer defines morphologic
subtypes informative of metastatic potential, although not
without considerable interobserver disagreement and clinical
heterogeneity particularly among the moderately differen-
tiated grade 2 (G2) tumors. We posited that a gene expression
signature capable of discerning tumors of grade 1 (G1) and
grade 3 (G3) histology might provide a more objective measure
of grade with prognostic benefit for patients with G2 disease.
To this end, we studied the expression profiles of 347 primary
invasive breast tumors analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.
Using class prediction algorithms, we identified 264 robust
grade-associated markers, six of which could accurately
classify G1 and G3 tumors, and separate G2 tumors into two
highly discriminant classes (termed G2a and G2b genetic
grades) with patient survival outcomes highly similar to those
with G1 and G3 histology, respectively. Statistical analysis of
conventional clinical variables further distinguished G2a and
G2b subtypes from each other, but also from histologic G1 and
G3 tumors. In multivariate analyses, genetic grade was
consistently found to be an independent prognostic indicator
of disease recurrence comparable with that of lymph node
status and tumor size. When incorporated into the Nottingham
prognostic index, genetic grade enhanced detection of patients
with less harmful tumors, likely to benefit little from adjuvant
therapy. Our findings show that a genetic grade signature can
improve prognosis and therapeutic planning for breast cancer
patients, and support the view that low- and high-grade
disease, as defined genetically, reflect independent pathobio-
logical entities rather than a continuum of cancer progression.

Introduction
In breast cancer care, treatment decisions are guided by efforts
to determine the metastatic potential of tumors. Clinical variables
that reflect metastatic potential (e.g., lymph node status, tumor
size, histologic grade) or predict for endocrine responsiveness (e.g.,
estrogen and progesterone receptors) are routinely used to classify
tumors into subtypes predictive of outcome. However, these
variables are unable to predict with sufficient accuracy which
patients will do well without adjuvant treatment, benefit from
adjuvant treatment, or respond poorly to current treatment
modalities. Some tumor subtypes, despite phenotypic homogeneity,
are associated with substantial clinical heterogeneity confounding
their clinical utility. Recent studies using DNA microarrays indicate
that such clinical heterogeneity may be resolvable at the molecular
level (1–6). Indeed, some have shown that gene expression
signatures underlying specific biological properties of cancer cells
may provide better stratification of metastatic potential than
established prognostic variables (1, 2, 7).
Histologic grading in breast cancer seeks to integrate measure-
ments of cellular differentiation and replicative potential into a
composite score that quantifies the aggressive behavior of a tumor.
The most studied and widely used method of breast tumor grading
is the Elston-Ellis modified Scarff, Bloom, Richardson grading
system, also known as the Nottingham Grading System (8, 9). The
Nottingham Grading System is based on a microscopic evaluation
of morphologic and cytologic features of tumor cells, including
degree of tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic
count (9). The sum of these scores stratifies breast tumors into
grade 1 (G1; well-differentiated, slow-growing), grade 2 (G2;
moderately differentiated), and grade 3 (G3; poorly differentiated,
highly proliferative) malignancies.
Multivariate analyses in large patient cohorts have consistently
shown that the grade of invasive breast cancer is a powerful
indicator of disease recurrence and patient death, independent of
lymph node status and tumor size (9–12). Untreated patients
with G1 disease have a f95% 5-year survival rate, whereas those
with G2 and G3 malignancies have survival rates at 5 years of
f75% and f50%, respectively. The value of histologic grade in
patient prognosis, however, has been questioned by reports of
substantial interobserver variability among pathologists (13–16),
leading to much debate over the role that grade should play in
therapeutic planning (17, 18). Furthermore, where the prognostic
significance of G1 and G3 disease is of more obvious clinical
relevance, it is less clear what the prognostic value is of the more
heterogeneous, moderately differentiated G2 tumors, which
comprise f50% of all breast cancer cases (12, 18, 19).
In this study, we hypothesized that a gene expression signature
capable of discriminating low- and high-grade tumors might

provide a more objective and clinically valuable measure of tumor
grade with prognostic significance for patients with moderately
differentiated cancer. Through analysis of breast cancer expression
data from multiple independent cohorts, we demonstrate the
existence of a genetic grade signature that distinguishes new
biological and clinical subtypes of breast cancer with important
prognostic implications.
Materials and Methods
Patients and tumor specimens. Clinical characteristics of patient and
tumor samples of the Uppsala, Stockholm, and Singapore cohorts are
summarized in Supplementary File 1A . All cohorts were of unselected
populations, and the original tumor material was demonstrate at the time
of surgery, frozen in dry ice or liquid nitrogen, and stored under liquid
nitrogen or at 70jC.
Uppsala cohort. The Uppsala cohort originally composed of 315 women
representing 65% of all breast cancers resected in Uppsala County, Sweden,
from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 1989. Information pertaining to
breast cancer therapy, clinical follow-up, and sample processing are
described elsewhere (20). For histologic grading, new tumor sections were
prepared from the original paraffin blocks and stained with eosin (with the
exception of a few original van Gieson-stained sections). All sections were
graded in a blinded fashion (H.N.) according to the Nottingham Grading
System (9) as follows:
Tubule Formation: 3 = poor, if <10% of the tumor showed definite tubule
formation, 2 = moderate, if z10% but V75%, and 1 = well, if >75%.
Mitotic Index: 1 = low, if <10 mitoses, 2 = medium, if 10 to 18 mitoses,
and 3 = high, if >18 mitoses (per 10 high-power fields). Field diameter
was 0.57 mm.
Nuclear Grade: 1 = low, for little variation in size and shape of nuclei, 2 =
medium for moderate variation, and 3 = high for marked variation
and large size.
Tumors with summed scores ranging from 3 to 5 were classified as G1;
6 to 7 as G2; and 8 to 9 as G3.
Estrogen and progesterone receptors were assessed by Abbott’s quan-
titative enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) and
deemed positive if >0.05 fmol/Ag DNA. Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) was measured in tumor cytosol by a quantitative immunoassay kit
(Quantikine-human VEGF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as described
(21). Protein levels of Ki67 were analyzed using anti-Ki67 antibody (MIB-1)
by the grid-graticula method with cutoffs: low = 2, medium >2 and <6,
high = 6. Cyclin E was measured using the antibody HE12 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) with cutoffs: low = 0% to 4%, medium =
5% to 49%, and high = 50% to 100% stained tumor cells (22). Vascular growth
was determined by routing staining of tumor sections. P53 mutational status
was determined by cDNA sequencing as previously described (20). The
Uppsala tumor samples were approved for microarray profiling by the
ethical committee at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.
Stockholm cohort. The Stockholm samples were derived from breast
cancer patients operated on at the Karolinska Hospital from January 1,
1994, through December 31, 1996, and identified in the Stockholm-Gotland
breast cancer registry (23). Information on patient age, tumor size, number
of metastatic axillary lymph nodes, hormonal receptor status, distant
metastases, site and date of relapse, initial therapy, and date and cause of
death were obtained from patient records and the Stockholm-Gotland
Breast Cancer Registry. Tumor sections were graded by H.N. in the same as
fashion as the Uppsala tumors. Only histologic G2 samples were evaluated
in this study. The Stockholm samples were approved for microarray
profiling by the ethical committee at the Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm,
Sweden.
Singapore cohort. The Singapore samples were derived from patients
operated on at the National University Hospital (Singapore) from February
1, 2000, through January 31, 2002. Routine clinical data were obtained from
pathology reports, but no information on recurrence or cause of death
was available. Tumor sections were graded by T.C.P. according to the
Nottingham grading system as applied to the Uppsala and Stockholm
cohorts, with the following exception: Mitotic Index: 1 = low, if <8 mitoses;
2 = medium, if 9 to 16 mitoses; and 3 = high, if >16 mitoses (per 10 high-
power fields); field diameter was 0.55 mm. Only histologic G2 samples
were evaluated in this study. The Singapore samples were approved for mic-
roarray profiling by the Singapore National University Hospital ethics board.
After exclusions based on tissue availability, RNA amount, RNA integrity,
clinical annotation, and microarray quality control, expression profiles of
249, 58, and 40 tumors from the Uppsala, Stockholm, and Singapore cohorts,
respectively, were deemed suitable for further analysis.
Microarray profiling. All tumor samples were profiled on the Affymetrix
U133A&B genechips. Microarray analysis of the Uppsala and Singapore
samples was carried out at the Genome Institute of Singapore. The
Stockholm samples were analyzed at Bristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, NJ;
ref. 23). All microarray data are accessible at National Center for Bio-
technology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus.9 Uppsala and
Singapore data can be accessed via series accession number GSE4922;
Stockholm data is accessible via series accession GSE1456. RNA prepara-
tion, microarray hybridization, and data processing were carried out
essentially as described (23, 24). All data were normalized using the global
mean method (MAS5), and probe set signal intensities were natural
log transformed and scaled by adjusting the mean signal to a target value
of log 500.
Class prediction. Prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) and
statistically weighted syndromes (SWS) were used side by side in this
study to allow a performance comparison between two robust but
mathematically distinct class prediction algorithms in terms of classifica-
tion accuracies and total number of genes required for maximum accuracy.
PAM is a modification of the nearest-centroid method and was applied as
previously described (25). SWS is a supervised, combinatorial pattern
recognition method based on a statistical voting procedure that uses
selected subsets of predictors that act alone or in combination (26, 27).
Briefly, the methodology is based on several steps: (a) optimal recoding of
the given covariates to obtain discrete-valued variables; (b) selection of
the most informative and statistically robust of these discrete-valued
variables and their combinations (termed syndromes) that best characterize
the classes of interest; (c) tallying the statistically weighted ‘‘votes’’ of
these syndromes to compute the value of the outcome prediction function
(by leave-one-out cross-validation). SWS was applied as previously
described (26).
Other data sets. The Sotiriou et al. (5) data was kindly provided by C.
Sotiriou (Jules Bordet Institut, Brussels, Belgium). The van’t Veer et al. (3)
and van de Vijver et al. (4) microarray data and clinical annotations were
downloaded from the Rosetta Inpharmatics publications archive. All
microarray probe sequences were mapped to UniGene build 186. For
hierarchical clustering, log expression values were mean centered, and
genes and tumors were clustered using Pearson correlation (uncentered)
and average linkage (CLUSTER and TREEVIEW software).10
The PAM 264-gene classifier. Initially, we ran the PAM algorithm with
all 44,928 probe sets as input in the Uppsala G1 to G3 comparisons and
acquired a minimal set of 18 probe sets, which gave the lowest
misclassification (error) rate: 3 of 68 for G1 and 3 of 55 for G3 predictions.
Alternatively, we identified a secondary minimum on the error curve at
264 probe sets, which misclassified only 4 of 68 G1 and 4 of 55 G3 tumors.
All 264 probe sets are differentially expressed between G1 and G3 tumors by
T-test and permutation m2-test (SWS) at P < 0.01 after adjusting for false
discovery (Bonferroni).
Statistical analysis of gene ontology terms. Gene ontology (GO)
analysis was facilitated by PANTHER software (28).11 Selected gene lists
were statistically compared (Mann-Whitney) with a reference list (i.e., NCBI

Build 35) composed of all genes represented on the microarray to identify
significantly overrepresented and underrepresented GO terms.
Survival analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to compute
survival curves, and the P value of the likelihood-ratio test was used to
assess the statistical significance of the resultant hazard ratios. Disease-free
survival in the Uppsala, Stockholm, and van de Vijver (4) cohorts was
defined as the time interval from surgery until the first recurrence (local,
regional, or distant) or last date of follow-up. For the Sotiriou and van’t Veer
data sets, the disease-free survival event was distant metastasis, as
previously published (3, 5). Cases with contralateral disease or events
occurring beyond 10 years were censored. Multivariate analysis by Cox
proportional hazard regression and all survival statistics were done in the R
survival package.
Scoring by the Nottingham prognostic index. Nottingham prognostic
index (NPI) scores were calculated as follows: [0.2 tumor size (cm)] +
grade (1, 2, or 3) + lymph node stage (I, II, or III). Tumor size was defined as
the longest diameter of the tumor. Lymph node stage was I if lymph node
negative, II if V3 nodes involved, and III if >3 nodes involved (29). As
the number of cancerous lymph nodes were not available for the Uppsala
cohort, a lymph node stage score of II was assigned if one or more nodes
were involved and a score of III if nodal involvement showed evidence
of periglandular growth. For genetic grade NPI (ggNPI) calculations, grade
scores (1, 2, or 3) were replaced by genetic grade predictions (1 or 3).
NPI scores V2.4 = EPG (excellent prognostic group); <3.4 = GPG (good
prognostic group); scores of 3.4 to 5.4 = MPG (moderate prognostic group);
scores >5.4 = PPG (poor prognostic group).
Descriptive statistics. For intergroup comparisons using the clinico-
pathologic measurements, Mann-Whitney U test statistics were used for
continuous variables and one-sided Fisher’s exact test used for categorical
variables (Statistica-6 and StatXact-6 software).
Results
PAM and SWS class prediction algorithms accurately
classify low- and high-grade tumors. To study the relationship
between gene expression and histologic grade, we analyzed the
expression patterns of >39,000 transcripts (i.e., 44,928 probe sets
on Affymetrix U133A&B arrays) in 347 primary breast tumors. The
tumors were derived from three independent population-based
cohorts: (a) Uppsala (249 samples), (b) Stockholm (58 samples),
and (c) Singapore (40 samples; Supplementary File 1A). Beginning
with the Uppsala data set, composed of 68 G1, 126 G2, and 55 G3
tumors, we examined the performance of two different class
prediction algorithms in predicting histologic grade as defined by
the Nottingham Grading System guidelines: prediction analysis of
microarrays (PAM) and statistically weighted syndromes (SWS).
Both algorithms rank order the genes according to specific
algorithmic criteria for assessing differential expression between
classes. Then, a posterior probability is iteratively estimated for
each sample by classic leave-one-out cross-validation. In two-group
comparisons, high misclassification error rates were observed in
the G1-G2 and G2-G3 predictions by both methods (data not
shown), whereas G1-G3 classification accuracy was very high,
suggesting that G2 tumors are not molecularly distinct from
those of low or high grade. For the G1-G3 comparisons, maximal
prediction accuracies were obtained with 18 probe sets (repre-
senting 18 genes) by PAM and only six probe sets (representing five
genes) by SWS (Table 1). Both methods correctly classified 96%
(65 of 68) of the G1s and 95% (52 of 55) of the G3s. Notably, all
genes of the classifiers (Table 1) are expressed at higher levels in G3
tumors, with the exception of three genes of the PAM classifier,
which are expressed at higher levels in the G1 tumors. The
posterior probability (Pr) calculated by each method is an estimate
of the likelihood that a sample belongs to one class (termed
‘‘G1-like’’) or the other (i.e., ‘‘G3-like’’). Both SWS and PAM scored
the vast majority of G1 and G3 tumors with high probabilities
of class membership. The Pr scores for the SWS class assignments

are shown in Supplementary File 1B . Notably, 95% of the tumors
showed >75% probability of belonging to either the G1-like or
G3-like class, indicating a highly discriminant statistical basis for
class prediction (see also Fig. 1A, top).
Separation of G2 tumors by genetic grade. We next applied
the SWS and PAM grade classifiers to the 126 G2 tumors of the
Uppsala cohort to ask if these genetic determinants of low and high
grade might resolve moderately differentiated G2 tumors into
separable classes. Interestingly, we observed that the G2 tumors
separated well into G1-like (n = 83) and G3-like (n = 43) classes
with few tumors (n = 5) exhibiting intermediate Pr scores
(Supplementary File 1C). As observed for the G1 and G3 tumors,
we found that a high percentage of the G2 tumors (96%) were
assigned by the SWS classifier (and 94% by the PAM classifier,
data not shown) to either the G1-like or G3-like classes with
>75% probability. To test whether this observation might reflect a
cohort-specific selection bias, we applied the classifiers directly
to G2 tumors of the Stockholm (n = 58) and Singapore (n = 40)
cohorts and observed similar results (Supplementary File 1D-E),
indicating that almost all G2 tumors can be molecularly well
separated into distinct low- and high-grade-like classes (henceforth
called G2a and G2b genetic grades).
Genetic grade is prognostic of disease recurrence in
moderately differentiated tumors. To determine if the genetic
grade classification correlates with patient outcome, we examined
the disease-free survival of patients with histologic G2 tumors
classified as G2a or G2b by the SWS algorithm (Fig. 1A, middle and
bottom). (Due to space limitations and high concordance between
the SWS and PAM classifiers, only data for the SWS classifier are
presented henceforth.) Overall, Uppsala patients with G2a tumors
showed significantly less disease recurrence than those with G2b
disease (P = 0.001; Fig. 1B). Notably, no significant difference was
observed between the G2a and G1 curves, or the G2b and G3
curves. The G2a-G2b survival difference was further observed in
specific therapeutic contexts, including patients who received no
adjuvant systemic therapy (P = 0.019; Fig. 1C) and those with
estrogen receptor–positive tumors who received endocrine therapy
only (P = 0.022; Fig. 1D). In a similar fashion, the genetic grade
classifier was also predictive of recurrence in the Stockholm (G2)
patients who received systemic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy,
endocrine therapy or both; P = 0.027; Supplementary File 1F) and
those with estrogen receptor–positive disease who received only
endocrine treatment (P = 0.032; Supplementary File 1G).
To assess the possibility of microarray platform-specific bias,
we tested the veracity of our findings using independent data
sets generated on different microarray platforms. Three publicly
available data sets were used: Sotiriou et al. (a custom spotted
cDNA array manufactured at the National Cancer Institute), and
van’t Veer et al. and van de Vijver et al. (both of which used a
custom oligonucleotide array by Agilent Technologies). As shown in
Fig. 2, all three data sets confirmed the significant associations
of our signature genes with disease recurrence in G2 breast
cancer. G2a and G2b tumors, as estimated by hierarchical cluster
analysis with the signature genes, displayed significant differences
in disease-free survival in estrogen receptor–positive, tamoxifen-
treated patients (P = 0.015; Fig. 2A); early stage, lymph node–
negative patients receiving no systemic therapy (P = 0.014; Fig. 2B);
and lymph node–positive patients receiving chemotherapy only
(P = 0.0065; Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings show that the
genetic grade signature is a robust prognostic indicator of disease-
free survival in moderately differentiated cancer independent of
different treatment modalities and reproducible in multiple
unrelated breast cancer cohorts.
Genetic grade is a powerful and independent risk factor. To
assess the prognostic importance of the genetic grade signature,
we used multivariate Cox regression models to compare its perfor-
mance to that of conventional prognostic indicators assessed in
each of the cohorts analyzed in Figs. 1 and 2, including lymph
node status, tumor size, patient age, and estrogen receptor
and progesterone receptor status (when available) entered as

categorical variables. We found that the genetic grade signature not
only remained significantly associated with disease recurrence in
most cases, but performed equal to or better than lymph node
status and tumor size in many patient subgroups (see Supplemen-
tary File 2A-E).
G2a and G2b subtypes are molecularly and pathologically
distinct. The clinical data suggest that G2a and G2b genetic grades
may represent separate pathologic entities. We investigated this
possibility in the Uppsala cohort by several approaches. First, we
analyzed the expression levels of the 264 probe sets (i.e.,
representing f232 genes) that we identified by PAM as the
maximum number of probe sets capable of recapitulating a high
G1-G3 classification accuracy (see Materials and Methods). These
genes represent the topmost significant differentially expressed
genes between G1 and G3 tumors after correcting for false
discovery (Supplementary File 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, hierarchical
cluster analysis using this set of genes shows a striking separation
of the G2 population into two primary tumor profiles highly
resembling the G1 and G3 profiles and that separate well into the
G2a and G2b classes. Indeed, all but 11 of these 264 probe sets
were also differentially expressed (at P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum
test) between the G2a and G2b tumors. This finding shows that
extensive molecular heterogeneity exists within the G2 tumor
population, and this heterogeneity is robustly defined by the major
determinants of G1 and G3 cancer. It also shows that a much larger
and pervasive transcriptional program underlies the genetic grade
predictions of the SWS signature—despite its composition of a
mere five genes. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the GO terms
associated with the G2a-G2b differentially expressed genes revealed
the significant enrichment of numerous biological processes
and molecular functions. Table 2 displays a selected set of
significantly enriched GO categories that includes cell cycle,
inhibition of apoptosis, cell motility, and stress response, suggest-
ing an imbalance of these cellular processes between the G2a- and
G2b-type tumor cells (see Supplementary File 3B for the complete
list of GO categories and associated P values).
To extend our analysis beyond the transcriptional level, we
investigated the differences between G2a and G2b tumors using
conventional clinicopathologic variables measured in the Uppsala
cohort (Supplementary File 2F). Of the three histologic grading
criteria, both mitotic count and nuclear pleomorphism were found
to significantly vary between the G2a and G2b tumors (P = 0.007
and P = 0.05, respectively). Protein levels of the proliferation
marker Ki67 were also found to be significantly different between
the G2a and G2b tumors (P < 0.0001). These findings, together with
those of the GO analysis, suggest that the genetic grade signature

microarray data sets: (A) Sotiriou et al. (ref. 5; cDNA microarray); (B ) van’t Veer et al. (ref. 3; long-oligonucleotide array); and (C ) van de Vijver et al. (ref. 4; same
array as in B). G2 tumors from each study were hierarchically clustered. Primary tumor branches (separating low and high expressors) were used to approximate G2a
and G2b tumors for survival analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival are shown for all patients (A-C ) and treatment-specific subgroups (A, C ).

may largely mirror cell proliferation, and thus reflect the replicative
potential of breast tumor cells. However, other oncogenic factors
were also found to be associated with genetic grade. In the G2b
tumors, protein levels of VEGF, a major inducer of angiogenesis,
and the degree of vascular growth were both found to be
significantly higher compared with the G2a samples (P = 0.015
and P = 0.002, respectively), suggesting that a difference in
angiogenic potential also distinguishes the two genetic grade
classes. TP53 mutations were found in only 6% (n = 5) of the G2a
tumors, whereas 44% (n = 19) of the G2b tumors were p53 mutants
(P < 0.0001) consistent with their higher replicative potential, and
likely conferring a further survival advantage to these tumors via
decreased apoptotic potential. We also observed higher levels of
cyclin E1 protein (P = 0.04) in the G2b tumors, which, in addition
to contributing to enhanced proliferation (30), may also confer
greater genomic instability (31, 32). Finally, we observed a
significant difference in hormonal status between the G2a and
G2b tumors, with a higher fraction of estrogen receptor–negative
(P = 0.06) and progesterone receptor–negative (P = 0.02) tumors in
the G2b class, indicating differences in hormone sensitivity and
dependence. Taken together, these results show that multiple
tumorigenic properties measured at the RNA, DNA, protein, and
cellular levels can subdivide the G2a and G2b tumor subtypes.
G2a and G2b tumors are not identical to histologic G1 and
G3 cancers. Both the survival and gene expression data suggest
that the G2a and G2b classes may be clinically and molecularly
indistinguishable from histologic G1 and G3 tumors, respectively.
To address this, we further analyzed the expression patterns of
the 264 grade-associated probe sets in the Uppsala cohort. We
discovered 14 genes and 57 genes significantly differentially
expressed (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) between the G1 and
G2a tumors and the G3 and G2b tumors, respectively. By GO
analysis, the differentially expressed genes of the G1-G2a
comparison pointed to significant differences in cell cycle-related
processes and oncogenesis, whereas differences between the G2a
and G3 tumors included cell cycle–related processes, inhibition of
apoptosis, oncogenesis, and cell motility (Table 2; Supplementary
File 3B).
Statistical analysis of the clinical markers revealed further
distinctions in the G1-G2a and the G2b-G3 tumor comparisons. As
shown in Supplementary File 2F, G2a tumors displayed significant
increases in tumor size, lymph node positivity, cellular mitoses,
tubule formation, and Ki67 levels compared with histologic G1
tumors, and the G3 population showed significant increases in
tumor size, vascular growth, mitoses, tubule formation, cyclin E1,
and estrogen receptor–negative status when compared with the
G2b tumors. Taken together, these data indicate that the G2a and
G2b populations, although highly similar to G1 and G3 tumors in
terms of survival and transcriptional configuration, remain
separable by conventional clinical characteristics and GO analysis
of differentially expressed genes.
Genetic grade improves prognosis by the NPI. The NPI is a
widely accepted method of stratifying patients into prognostic
groups (GPG, MPG, and PPG) based on lymph node stage, tumor
size, and histologic grade (33). We investigated whether incorpo-
rating genetic grade into the NPI could improve patient
stratification. A simplified substitution method was explored. For
all tumors of the Uppsala and Stockholm cohorts for which NPI

scores and survival information could be obtained (n = 296),
histologic grade (1, 2, or 3) was replaced by the genetic grade
prediction (1 or 3) and new NPI (i.e., ggNPI) scores were computed
(see Materials and Methods). The survival of patients stratified into
risk groups was then compared between classic NPI and ggNPI.
As shown in Fig. 4A , the survival curves of the NPI and ggNPI
prognostic groups were highly comparable; however, we observed
that the ggNPI tended to shift patients from worse to better
prognostic groups. Practical guidelines that use the NPI in
therapeutic decision-making often recognize an EPG composed
of patients with NPI scores V2.4 (34, 35). Untreated patients in
this group with lymph node–negative disease have a 95% 10-year
survival probability—equivalent to that of an age-matched female
population without breast cancer (35). Thus, patients in this group
are routinely not recommended for postoperative adjuvant therapy
(34–36). We compared the EPGs, as defined by the NPI and ggNPI
stratifications, in a subset of 142 lymph node–negative patients
who received no adjuvant systemic therapy. Forty and 82 patients
were classified into the EPG by the classic NPI and ggNPI,
respectively. Of the 40 patients classified into the EPG by the classic
NPI, only one was considered different by the ggNPI; whereas of
those classified as needing adjuvant therapy by the classic NPI
(i.e., scores >2.4), 43 were reclassified by the ggNPI into the EPG.
When examined for outcome, the survival curves of the 40 and 82

indistinguishable, both showing f94% survival at 10 years

genetic grade can improve prognostication of which patients

Discussion
Although the clinical subtyping of cancer has historically been
based largely on phenotypic properties, comprehensive genomic and
transcriptomic analyses are beginning to reveal robust genotypic
determinants of tumor subtype. In this report, we show that the
genetic essence of histologic grade can be distilled down to the
expression patterns of a mere five genes with powerful prognostic
implications. We found that G2a and G2b tumors, as distinguished
by the five-gene genetic grade signature, displayed markedly
different metastatic potentials—a finding that was robustly repro-
ducible in independent breast cancer cohorts and in the context of
different microarray platforms. Further analysis revealed that the
G2a and G2b classes could be separated by extensive molecular,
biological, and tumorigenic differences known to separate low- and
high-grade cancer (37), including proliferation rate (mitotic index,
Ki67), angiogenic potential (VEGF, vascular growth), p53 mutational
status, and estrogen and progesterone dependence.
Ma et al. (38) were the first to report a histologic grade signature
capable of distinguishing low- and high-grade breast cancer. Using
12K cDNA microarrays to analyze material from 10 G1, 11 G2, and
10 G3 microdissected tumors, they identified 200 genes differen-
tially expressed between G1 and G3 tumors. Using these genes for
tumor clustering, they observed that the majority of G2 tumors
possessed a hybrid signature intermediate to G1 and G3, with few
exceptions (see Fig. 3 of their original report; ref. 38). Notably, this
finding is in contrast with our discovery that the majority of
G2 tumors do not display hybrid signatures, but rather possess
clear G1-like or G3-like genetic features. According to our classifier,
only a small percentage (f6%) of the tumors in our study had
intermediate genetic grade measurements (i.e., Pr scores <0.75 for
G1-like and G3-like). To address this discrepancy, we cross-
compared the 200 grade-associated genes in their list to our
expanded set of 232 genes, and observed a statistically significant
overlap of 35 genes (P < 1.0  107; Monte Carlo simulation).
This overlap, however, represents only a small percentage of either
gene list, indicating that the discrepant observations are most likely
explained by fundamentally different signature compositions.
It is also possible that differences in sample selection and prepara-
tion, sample size, RNA purification, microarray analysis, and data
normalization could have contributed to the variable results.
It should also be noted that although a small percentage (6%)
of the tumors in this study had intermediate genetic grade measu-
rements, too few were discovered to determine the clinical
relevance of this intermediate genotype. Furthermore, the origins
of these intermediate tumors are unclear and could be biological
or technical in nature. They may arise as homogeneous tumors
that truly borderline low and high grade, or rather reflect
heterogeneous compositions of both low- and high-grade cell
types, such as that observed in tubular mixed carcinoma (39).
Alternatively, that we observed the same percentage of interme-
diacy in tumors of all grades and across cohorts suggests that
this class may represent a baseline level of uncertainty owing to
technical noise.
Whether grade is a continuum through which breast cancer
progresses or merely the end point of distinct genetic pathways has
been debated (39–44). Studies comparing primary tumors to their
subsequent metastases have supported the grade progression
model, particularly when multiple recurrences were analyzed
(39, 45). However, comparative genomic studies have identified
reproducible chromosomal alterations that distinguish low- and
high-grade disease, including a 16q deletion unique to G1
carcinomas (43, 44, 46). These studies argue against the progression
model and point to genetic origins of histologic grade. In our study,
94% of 347 primary tumors could be molecularly classified with
high probability of being G1-like or G3-like. This finding supports
the genetic pathways model of grade origin, suggesting that the
large majority of breast cancers fundamentally exist in one of two
predominant forms marked by the molecular and clinical essence
of low or high grade. Whether these forms correlate with grade-
specific genomic alterations (43, 44, 46) remains unknown.
In multivariate analyses (Supplementary File 2), not only did the
grade signature remain an independent predictor of disease
recurrence in most of the patient subgroups analyzed, but in most
cases, it was equivalent to or more powerful than lymph node
status and tumor size, underscoring its role as a valuable new
prognostic indicator. Other studies have reported gene expression
signatures prognostic of breast cancer recurrence (2–5, 24, 47, 48);
however, the contribution of grade-predictive genes within these
signatures is largely unclear. Of our five genetic grade genes, three
are components of other prognostic signatures in breast cancer.
BRRN1 overlaps with our previously published 32-gene TP53
signature (24). MELK is a component of both the van’t Veer et al.
(3) 70-gene metastasis predictor and the Sotiriou et al. (5) 485-gene
list associated with recurrence. STK6 is a component of the Paik
et al. (47) 21-gene metastasis predictor. To what extent these
signatures capture the prognostic potential of grade remains
unknown. For example, histologic grade was not significant in a
multivariate model with the van’t Veer (4) 70-gene predictor,
whereas grade remained highly significant (P < 0.001) in a
multivariate model including the Paik 21-gene signature (47).
How the genetic grade signature can add value to conventional and
signature-based prognostic models should be further considered.
Following submission of this article, Sotiriou et al. (49) published
their findings of a 97-gene expression grade index associated with
histologic grade and correlated with relapse-free survival in
estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. Their grade index, like
our grade signature, could dichotomize the vast majority of G2
tumors into two groups with expression profiles and survival
characteristics resembling those of G1 and G3 tumors. Likewise,
the prognostic performance of their grade index was found to be
independent of lymph node status and tumor size. Comparison of
the two gene classifiers revealed that three of our five grade
signature genes, and 68 of our larger 232-gene set, overlapped with
their 97-gene index. This high degree of overlap suggests that the
two signatures may use the same fundamental transcriptional
programming for predicting patient outcomes. Whether the two
predictors are collinear with respect to patient survival will be an
important question moving forward. Nevertheless, that our two
studies converge on similar findings reinforces the view that gene
expression–based measurements of histologic grade can substan-
tially contribute to patient prognosis.
Our results indicate that G2 invasive breast cancer, at least in
genetic terms, does not exist as a single clinical entity. The genetic
grade signature dichotomized G2 tumors into biologically and

clinically distinct subtypes that significantly improved patient
prognosis. By adding genetic grade to the NPI (ggNPI), we showed
that twice as many lymph node–negative patients could be
accurately classified with an excellent prognosis, suggesting that
the use of genetic grade can improve prediction of which patients
should be spared systemic adjuvant therapy thereby minimizing
harm due to late adverse health effects. The value of the ggNPI on the
prognosis of lymph node–positive patients, however, was less clear
as the stratification of these patients by the classic NPI was
encumbered by insufficient clinical data (in the Uppsala cohort)
regarding number of positive nodes. Further studies in large and
sufficiently characterized cohorts will be needed to better determine
the value of integrating tumor genetic grade with the NPI.
In conclusion, the genetic grading of moderately differentiated
tumors allows the refinement of the G2 subtype into subgrades 2a
and 2b with significant clinical ramifications. Although several G1
and G3 tumors were misclassified by the genetic grade signature,
too few were observed to study the prognostic significance of the
signature in high and low grade disease. Indeed, it is possible that
the predictive capacity of the grade signature could extend to
all tumors, regardless of histologic grade, as a continuous scalable
variable (7, 47). How to best integrate the genetic grade measu-
rement with other risk factors for improved prognosis warrants
further study.
