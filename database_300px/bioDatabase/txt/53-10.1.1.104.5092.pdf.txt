ABSTRACT
ProDom is a comprehensive database of protein
domain families generated from the global com-
parison of all available protein sequences. Recent
improvements include the use of three-dimensional
(3D) information from the SCOP database; a com-
pletely redesigned web interface (http://www.
toulouse.inra.fr/prodom.html); visualization of
ProDom domains on 3D structures; coupling of
ProDom analysis with the Geno3D homology model-
ling server; Bayesian inference of evolutionary
scenarios for ProDom families. In addition, we have
developed ProDom-SG, a ProDom-based server
dedicated to the selection of candidate proteins for
structural genomics.
INTRODUCTION
The ProDom protein domain family database originates from
the early recognition that automated methods are needed to
reach comprehensiveness of protein domain analysis (1–3).
This comprehensiveness makes ProDom a unique resource
usefully complementing expert derived databases, such as
PROSITE (4), PFAM (5) or SMART (6), thereby helping
to sustain the rapid growth of InterPro (7,8). In recent
years, we have developed relationships between ProDom
and three-dimensional (3D) structural information, both for
ProDom construction and in the ProDom user interface.
METHODS USED TO CONSTRUCT ProDom
ProDom2004.1 was built anew from the SWISS-PROT41.23
and TrEMBL24.11 databases, essentially as described pre-
viously (2,7). In the first stage, well-characterized domain
families were used to recruit homologous domains using
PSI-BLAST. Among these families, 21 families were derived
from in-house expertise and 1352 structural domain families
were selected from SCOP release 1.63 (9) using the
ASTRAL compendium (10) on the basis of the following
criteria: (i) length homogeneity (the shortest sequence should
be at most 25% shorter than the longest); (ii) sequence homo-
geneity (family diameter below 450 PAM); (iii) the family
should contain at least two different domains; (iv) domains
should not contain internal repeats; and (v) they should not be
longer than 500 amino acids. In the second stage, domain
families were automatically clustered using the MKDOM2
program (2). The resulting protein domain families were
aligned using an improved parallelized program called
ProDomAlign, developed in C++ using OpenMP. ProDom-
Align is based on MultAlin (11), a program well suited to
align very large sequence families (thousands of sequences).
Multiple alignments were assessed using the norMD
objective function proposed by Thompson et al. (12).
Other consistency indicators include family diameter and
radius of gyration as proposed previously (3). Each family
is identified by a unique accession number, which is followed
across successive ProDom releases using the MatchDom pro-
gram (7). Links among ProDom, InterPro (8) and Pfam-A (5)
were calculated using MatchDom. Links with PROSITE were
calculated using pftools (4). Matches with the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) (13) were more difficult to maintain because of
sequence numbering inconsistencies. We, therefore, searched
the PDB for sequence identity with ProDom domains using
the PDB ATOM record rather than SEQRES, in order to
superimpose sequence and structural information. The
current ProDom2004.1 release covers 726 272 protein
sequences and contains 186 303 domain families with two
or more domains.
THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE ON
THE ProDom WEBSITE
The ProDom website was completely redesigned in order to
get a more ergonomic user interface. The main ProDom form

consists of two parts. The first part (ProDom Browsing) allows
querying of ProDom in a variety of ways: (i) by accession
number (Display a ProDom entry); (ii) by the display of all
proteins belonging to one or several ProDom families with
logical AND/OR operators (All proteins in ProDom families);
(iii) by related databases (InterPro, PROSITE, PFAM or
PDB); (iv) by SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL identifier or accession
number; and (v) by keyword search with AND/OR operators.
The output is either information on a given domain family
(Figure 1) or cartoons displaying the domain arrangements of
all proteins matching the query (Figure 2). The number of
different cartoons available for domain display was increased
from 14 160 to 237 888 with the use of 64 colours, providing
for more legible outputs while preserving consistency across
different displays.
The ProDom graphical interface also provides for the dis-
play of ProDom domains on 3D structures (Figure 1). It is
possible to display one or all ProDom domains, either on one
polypeptide chain or on all chains, with different colour codes
for different domain families. These domain-enhanced struc-
tures can be displayed with Rasmol (14), MDL Chime or in
VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language), provided the
corresponding helper applications have been installed. Alter-
natively, they can be rendered as static images from three
different angles generated with the help of DSSP (15) and
MOLSCRIPT (16). Users may also choose to define particular
viewing angles and opt for stereo display.
The second part of the main ProDom form allows for
BLAST searches in ProDom (Compare your sequence with
ProDom), suggesting a possible domain arrangement for any
query protein. When 3D structures are available for target
domains, the output is directly linked to both SWISS-
MODEL (17) and Geno3D (18) servers for homology-based
domain modelling.

ProDom-CG: RESTRICTION OF ProDom TO
COMPLETED GENOMES
ProDom-CG is a subset of ProDom, restricted to sequences
derived from completely sequenced genomes. Bacterial
protein sets (19) were retrieved from the ExPASy server (ftp://
www.expasy.org/databases/hamap/complete_proteomes),
while eukaryotic protein sets were retrieved from the
EBI server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8). All relevant multi-
ple alignments and characteristics were recalculated on the
Figure 2.Domain arrangements of proteins in a ProDom family. (A) Proteins sharing the same domain architecture are grouped in order to simplify the output. This
feature can be disabled to display a complete output. (B) String search in SWISS-PROT identifiers or accession numbers allows to highlight the corresponding
proteins in the display. (C) Navigation bar to browse the output, with at most 200 different domain arrangements displayed in a single page. (D) The left icon on each
line is linked to a display of all proteins sharing at least one homologous domain with the current protein. When relevant, another icon points to the list of all proteins
sharing the same domain architecture. Domain cartoons are hypertext-linked to the corresponding ProDom domain families (Figure 1) whose accession number is
also available on mouse-over together with a short description.

resulting families. In order to provide insight into the evolution
of domain families, we used a Bayesian network methodology
to infer the most probable evolutionary scenario for each
family. Such a scenario may be complex, including domain
loss or horizontal transfer events. The taxonomy tree encom-
passing completely sequenced genomes was colour-coded so
as to indicate ancestral nodes predicted to contain domains in a
given ProDom-CG family. These colour-coded trees are avail-
able for each ProDom-CG entry on the ProDom website.
ProDom-SG FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS
In the framework of structural genomics projects, it is extre-
mely useful to identify potential targets unlikely to share
homology to already known structures. We, therefore, devel-
oped the ProDom-SG (Structural Genomics) server, designed
to assist in the selection of protein domain families corre-
sponding to potentially new folds on the basis of lack of
detected homology. The server also allows for the identifica-
tion of favourable protein candidates for crystallization stu-
dies. ProDom-SG was built in three steps. In the first step, only
ProDom families with norMD values above 0.5 were consid-
ered. In the second step, potential homology relationships
between ProDom families were identified using PSI-BLAST
with family specific, position-specific scoring matrices. When
applicable, the existence of such related families is indicated
using a specific logo appearing at the top of the family infor-
mation sheet (in field A, Figure 1). In the third step, both direct
and indirect links to the PDB were recorded for each family. A
direct link implies that an experimental structure is available
for at least one domain in the ProDom family, whereas an
indirect link reflects the existence of structural information for
at least one domain in a related family. These relationships are
stored in a PostgreSQL database that can be accessed on the
ProDom-SG website and can be queried by keyword or species
of interest. The user can retrieve ProDom families either
linked or not linked to the PDB, directly or indirectly. Thus
ProDom-SG provides for inspection of domain families on the
basis of structure availability, which allows to characterize
protein families containing a known fold. Conversely,
ProDom-SG provides a quick handle on candidate domain
families for which no structural information is available nor
can be readily inferred. Such families are indicated by a
ProDom-SG logo appearing at the top of the family informa-
tion sheet (in field A, Figure 1). ProDom families retrieved can
be further filtered on the basis of sequence homogeneity
(family diameter) and the number of domains in the family.
It is also possible to restrict the search to ProDom families
containing at least one mono-domain protein, thus obviating
the need for engineering individual domains separately before
crystallization attempts.
