ABSTRACT
The reliable recognition of eukaryotic RNA poly-
merase II core promoters, and the associated
transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes, has been
an ongoing challenge for computational biology.
High throughput experimental methods such as til-
ing arrays or 50 SAGE/EST sequencing have recently
lead to much larger datasets of core promoters, and
to the assessment that the well-known core pro-
moter sequence elements such as the TATA box
appear to be much less frequent than thought.
Here, we address the co-occurrence of several pre-
viously identified core promoter sequence motifs in
Drosophila melanogaster to determine frequently
occurring core promoter modules. We then use this
in a new strategy to model core promoters as a
set of alternative submodels for different core pro-
moter architectures reflecting these different motif
modules. We show that this system improves greatly
on computational promoter recognition and leads
to highly accurate in silico TSS prediction. Our
results indicate that at least for the case of the fruit
fly, we are getting closer to an understanding of how
the beginning of a gene is defined in a eukaryotic
genome.
INTRODUCTION
The concerted and differentiated expression of genes is
necessary for the existence of complex eukaryotic organisms
with an intricate development that requires precise control of
the expression of information. Understanding the regulation
of gene expression is therefore one of the most interesting
challenges in molecular biology today. We are only begin-
ning to elucidate the impressive logic and organization of
tightly interwoven players that a cell uses to determine the
active state of every component in it (1,2). One of the most
important control levels is the first step of gene expression,
the transcription of a gene into messenger-RNAs. Protein-
coding genes, as well as some classes of regulatory non-
coding genes (in particular miRNAs), are transcribed
by RNA polymerase II (pol-II). The transcriptional control
region of pol-II regulated genes encompasses a core pro-
moter, a proximal promoter region, and possibly distal
enhancers, all of which contain transcription factor binding
sites (TFBS) (3).
Core promoters are responsible for guiding the polymerase
to the correct transcription start site (TSS) and span the
region from [50, +50] relative to the TSS. Accurate initia-
tion of transcription depends on assembling a complex con-
taining pol-II and at least six general transcription factors
(4,5), the most important of which is TFIID. TFIID is a pro-
tein complex which consists of the TATA binding protein
(TBP) and at least a dozen other components known as
TAFs (TBP associated factors) which also interact, directly
or indirectly, with sequence elements in the core promoter.
Comprehensive analyses of fly core promoters (6,7) as well
as plants and mammals (8,9) have suggested that the well-
known TATA box, which is located 25 nt upstream of the
TSS, occurs in at most 25–30% of the genes within a genome,
despite its conservation in all eukaryotes. However, so-called
TBP related factors (TRFs) may substitute for TBP in the
TFIID complex and contribute to the activation of specific
subsets of genes. TRF1 binds to TATA-box like sequences
in Drosophila; TRF2 is present in vertebrates as well but
does not show sequence specific interactions. Instead, a
study on fly genes showed that it occurs in a complex with
the DNA replication element binding factor [DRE factor
(10)]. Compared to other core promoter sequence elements,
its location appears to be much less restricted relative to
the start site.
In Drosophila as well as vertebrates, the sequence at the
TSS is conserved and referred to as the Initiator motif (Inr).
Sequences downstream of the TSS were also found to exert
influence on basal transcription activity. Experimental evi-
dence for a specific downstream promoter element DPE (6)
suggests that the DPE is as widely used as the TATA box.
Its core motif is located exactly from 28 to 33 bp downstream
of the TSS and is recognized by two distinct TAFs. A second

distinct downstream element called MTE (Motif 10 Element),
located at positions 17–22, has been computationally pre-
dicted and experimentally verified (7,11), and is also thought
to interact with parts of TFIID. Despite evidence for down-
stream vertebrate elements, current knowledge suggests that
DPE and MTE may play a less important role in these organ-
isms. However, a different downstream element called DCE
has been found in human promoters (12). Thus, elements
show organism specific patterns: the initiator has higher
information content, and the DPE is much more frequent in
fly promoters compared to mammals. In addition, the major-
ity of mammalian promoters are associated with so-called
CpG islands—regions of atypically high density of CG
dinucleotides—a phenomenon which does not exist in many
other species, including Drosophila.
An important area of computational sequence analysis is
concerned with the analysis and identification of regulatory
DNA (13). Recent computational methods for core promoter
prediction are based on solid machine learning techniques
like probabilistic sequence models or support vector
machines, and have shown good performance on fly predic-
tions (7,14). As mentioned above, species-specific distinc-
tions in promoter motifs make it necessary to adapt systems
to particular species. An evaluation on the human genome
(15) showed that vertebrate systems have also recently
improved, but most are still hampered by a strong bias
towards CpG island promoters, as well as our lesser
understanding of core promoter motifs when compared to
Drosophila. A recent publication has explicitly modeled
mammalian promoters not associated with CpG islands
(16), and reports promising results by combining positional
preference and co-occurrence of oligomers, yet without
reporting distinct new motifs which may serve as targets of
the general transcription machinery. In this paper, we will
further investigate the architecture of core promoters in the
Drosophila melanogaster genome, define a set of core pro-
moter modules, and show that making use of our increasing
knowledge of core promoter modules in computational sys-
tems leads to an accurate prediction of core promoters/TSSs.
METHODS
McPromoter: TSS prediction with probabilistic
sequence models
A hidden Markov model [HMM; (17)] is a state-based
generative model which transitions stochastically from state
to state, emitting a single feature (here, a symbol representing
a nucleotide in the DNA) from each state according to
that state’s emission probabilities. A generalized HMM
[gHMM; also referred to as semi-Markov model (18)]
extends this process to emitting a sequence of consecutive
features, or segments, from each state. A state now incorpo-
rates a joint emission distribution for a sequence of features,
and a discrete length distribution on the size of the sequence.
States can e.g. represent short sequence motifs (such as the
TATA box), sequence fragments of a particular size but no
discernible motif (the spacer between TATA box and initia-
tor), or the general base composition. Efficient algorithms
exist to calculate the best division of a sequence into these
segments during training and evaluation.
The McPromoter system, which we have developed previ-
ously (7,19), consisted of one linear gHMM for a promoter
sequence, with states representing different segments of the
promoter from 250 to +50: upstream 1 and 2, TATA box,
spacer, initiator, and downstream. In addition to the core pro-
moter per se, our promoter model incorporates states repre-
senting the proximal promoter region up to 250 because it
is characterized by a distinct profile in the GC content. Inter-
polated Markov chains were used as emission distributions,
and histograms bounded by a minimum and maximum
value as length distributions. The Viterbi algorithm was
used to compute the likelihood of the most probable seg-
mentation of a sequence and the associated state path. We
also employed the Viterbi algorithm during training: After
initialization on overlapping adjacent subsequences, both
emission and length distributions were iteratively re-
estimated according to the most probable segmentations of
the training data. Non-promoter sequences were represented
by two interpolated Markov chain models, trained on coding
and non-coding/intronic genomic sequences. To accurately
reflect the potential presence of a gene on both sense and
anti-sense strand, both non-promoter models were mixtures
with two components trained on sense or anti-sense
sequences, respectively. To localize promoters in genomic
sequences, an input window of 300 bp was shifted along
both sides of the sequence, and the log likelihood ratio
score of promoter versus best non-promoter model, as well
as the position of the initiator state, was stored for each win-
dow. Local maxima were reported as TSS if they exceeded a
pre-set threshold on the score. We had previously augmented
the sequence features with features for DNA physicochemical
properties such as bendability (20); however, the additional
benefits of these became negligible as available training
data became larger (7).
In this study, we compared the performance of this previ-
ous system with one model against a new system with parallel
gHMMs representing different core promoter motif modules.
To establish these gHMMs, we performed a semi-supervised
clustering on the training set of experimentally inferred core
promoters in the following way:
(i) Initial data partitioning. We obtained initial overlapping
partitions of the data based on strong hits to known core
promoter motifs/modules.
(ii) Model initialization. We specified several gHMMs
representing the different core promoter modules and
trained each model on the respective initial partition of
sequences. The topology of each model was motivated
by the number of promoter motifs in the partition (one or
two) as well as the approximate location of the motifs
relative to the start site and each other, and the number
of states varied accordingly between five and seven.
(iii) Clustering. We performed three iterations of
an expectation-maximization-style semi-supervised
clustering.
(a) Re-classify all promoters in the data set according
to the model yielding the highest likelihood. If the
number of sequences for one class falls below a pre-
specified cutoff, eliminate its model from the set of
models and assign its sequences to the class with the
second highest likelihood.

(b) Re-estimate the model parameters according to the
new classification. This was done in a 5-fold cross-
validation setup, i.e. five promoter models were
trained on four-fifths of the training data each and
evaluated on the fifth of sequences which were not
part of the training data.
To localize promoters in genomic sequences, the score of
each genomic window was computed as the log likelihood
ratio score of the best promoter versus best non-promoter
model, where the non-promoter models were identical to
the ones described above. In this way, we were able make
predictions about the type of core promoter along with its
location.
Data sets
To allow for an unbiased comparison of our new approach
with previous ones, we used comprehensive training data
which we have previously described (7), in particular, a set
of 1941 promoters (covering the region of [250, +50] with
respect to the TSS), inferred from clusters of aligned cap-
trapped ESTs. A set of 1864 non-redundant sequences was
prepared by removing highly similar sequences in this set
according to the standards used by the Eukaryotic Promoter
Database (21). As genomic test data, we used a benchmark
set of 92 TSSs located in the 2.9 Mb Adh genomic fragment
(22). We removed an additional 31 sequences from the
training set which were located in this region.
A promoter was considered as containing a specific core
promoter motif if it had a match to one of the core promoter
weight matrices given in (7), with a significance level of
P < 0.001 as computed by patser (23). This was used to
obtain the initial partition of the training data which is then
clustered, and to assess the co-occurrence of pairs of motifs.
Numbers referring to the frequency of particular motifs are
therefore conservative estimates.
Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of the system in two different
settings, as described previously. First, the accuracy of the
classifier was determined by cross-validation on the promoter
and non-promoter sequence data sets of 300 bp long
sequences (20). We evaluated the accuracy in terms of aver-
age equal recognition rate (i.e. the threshold for which the
rate of true positives equals the rate of true negatives), cross
correlation, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) inte-
gral. Second, the classifier was tested on the task of genome
annotation, where we evaluated the success on locating TSSs
in genomic DNA (22). TSSs were counted as true positive if
they fall into a region of [500, +50] around the annotated
TSS of the test genes. Predictions outside this region and
overlapping the test genes were counted as false positives.
RESULTS
In a previous study, we selected experimentally validated
Drosophila TSSs from alignments of cap-trapped ESTs,
by determining the 50 end of only the most upstream entry
within a cluster of overlapping ESTs if it fulfilled certain
quality criteria (7). An analysis to identify over-represented
motifs within this large set of 2000 core promoters sur-
rounding the TSSs lead to a list of 10 significant sequence
elements.
Briefly summarizing this result, the list included the known
TATA box (Motif 3), initiator (Inr, Motif 4), and downstream
promoter element (DPE, Motif 9). These elements showed a
preference for a specific distance to the TSS: TATA boxes for
the 25, Inr for the +1, and DPE for the +30 region. In addi-
tion to these three well known and positionally restricted
sequence elements, another motif (named Motif 10 Element
or MTE after its position in the list of enriched motifs)
showed a strong preference for a downstream location imme-
diately next to DPE. We have subsequently shown that motif
10 is a new functional core promoter element, located
between the Inr and DPE elements at position +20 (11).
Motif 2 corresponded to the DNA replication element DRE,
which had at the same time been shown to interact with the
TBP replacing factor TRF2 (which itself does not bind specif-
ically to DNA) (10). We confirmed the role of this motif as a
frequent promoter element not only in DNA replication
related genes which it was named after. The other five ele-
ments are still unconfirmed as functional elements, including
somewhat surprisingly the strongest motif (Motif 1; M1), and
Motif 6 (M6) which loosely resembles a variation of the
TATA box. In the following, we will not consider the remain-
ing three motifs from our previous analysis: Motif 5 is a con-
sensus E box motif, the typical binding site of transcription
factors with basic helix–loop–helix DNA-binding protein
domains which is enriched in core promoters (24) but likely
not a direct interaction partner of the basal machinery. Motifs
7 and 8 do not show a location preference and may be arti-
facts of the motif finding algorithm, reflecting the sequence
composition rather than particular motifs.
Establishing subclasses of promoters
Several core motifs have been known to work in cooperation,
most notably the initiator motif paired with either TATA box,
DPE, or MTE (6,11). When looking at motif pairs occurring
preferentially in the same promoter (Table 1), the most
prominent cases include combinations of the Inr with down-
stream elements (DPE and MTE) and also with the TATA
box, as well as the combination of yet uncharacterized motifs
1 and 6. We examined the location preference of the motif
1/motif 6 (M1/6) module in detail: Despite a rather weak
location preference of each individual motif (Figure 1A
and B), the distinct preferred distance between the two ele-
ments is striking (Figure 1C). Given the low co-occurrence
of motif 1 with the Inr and motif 6 with the TATA box
(Table 1), and the similar spacing preference, this new com-
bination may serve as an alternative to the TATA/Inr module.
In an independent computational study, M1/6 was also found
to be a highly significant core module (14). The observed co-
occurrence pattern of these core promoter motifs strongly
indicates a scenario in which at least four frequent modules
of core promoter motifs exist, and where the widely studied
TATA/initiator pair is simply one of several options. This
idea of different core promoter architectures was initially
posed for Drosophila in conjunction with the DPE element
(6), and has been recently put forward for plants and verte-
brates as well (25,26).

In addition to the four pair modules, promoters with the
experimentally proven Inr and DRE motifs alone were
found to be frequent. We thus divided the set of experiment-
ally inferred core promoters in six partitions (Figure 2), and
specified generalized HMMs representing these different
core promoter modules. The model topologies (i.e. the num-
ber of states per model and the minimum and maximum value
of the state length distribution) were chosen as follows: Inr
and DRE models: 5 states [(100,115), (105,115), (15,45),
(5,15), (35,50)]; M1/6 and TATA/Inr models: 6 states
[(100,115), (105,115), (5,15), (10,30), (5,15), (35, 50)]; Inr/
DPE and Inr/MTE models: 7 states [(100,115), (105,115),
(15,45), (5,15), (5,20), (5,15), (5,15)]. Next, we performed
several iterations of semi-supervised clustering of the pro-
moter training data. Figure 2 shows that the initial partitions
generally proved to be stable and did not cluster together
large fractions of sequences initially assigned to a different
class. A notable exception was the Inr/MTE class, the
sequences of which were gradually split up among the
other classes and which was therefore removed previous to
the last iteration. The DPE class was the one with the highest
fraction of sequences initially assigned to a different cluster;
this may be due to the DPE weight matrix we used, which
extends beyond the DPE requirements as defined in Ref. (6)
and may in fact be too stringent. Instead of one model
averaging over all core promoters, we thus arrived at a set

of five models representing different sub-classes and core
modules. Figure 3 shows the models for the five subclasses
as specified above, and their average GC content in the
[250, 50] region with respect to the TSS. There were two
roughly equally frequent groups of core promoters: One
with a prominent rise of GC content followed by a ‘dip’ in
the 25 region of the TATA box (comprised of the estab-
lished TATA, Inr, and DPE classes), and a second one with
a distinctly different, GC-poor profile (comprised of the
motif 1/6 and DRE classes) which corresponded to the pro-
moters whose functional motifs show a less pronounced
location preference. Note that the clustering indicated that
there were distinct features within these two broad classes,
as can be seen in the M1/6 and DRE class which showed lit-
tle evidence of taking on new sequences from other initial
partitions.
Using explicit models for core promoter subclasses to
improve on prediction results
These results suggested adapting computational models to
this situation where a core promoter is not regarded as a
fixed functional element any longer. Rather, it shows one
of several distinct motif arrangements using a repertoire of
Figure 2. Comparison of motif module frequency in the initial and the final partitioning after semi-supervised clustering. Only initial frequencies are shown for
the partition of sequences without a strong motif hit (‘no initial’), i.e. which were initially not assigned to a particular motif class, and for the MTE motif
partition, which proved to be not stable and was gradually split up among the other classes. For each of the final partitions, we show the number of promoters
with the same motif/module, i.e. which are left from the initial partitions (blue); the number of promoters which were initially assigned to a different partition
among the five stable subclasses (red); and the number of promoters from the initial ‘no motif’ and MTE partitions (yellow). Promoters were assigned to several
initial partitions in case several motifs/modules had a good hit, and the combined size of the initial partitions thus adds up to more than the total dataset of 1864
promoters.

motifs, some of which occur preferentially together as pairs
and can be regarded as simple transcriptional modules. We
applied the five new core promoter models on our previously
described benchmark data of 300 bp long promoter and non-
promoter sequences (coding and intronic/non-coding; http://
www.fruitfly.org/sequence/drosophila-datasets.html), using
the same non-promoter models. Comparing the performance
of the previous single-promoter-model system with the new
five-model system, the best average cross-correlation value
of promoter versus non-promoter classification increased
from 0.79 to 0.89, with an equal recognition rate improve-
ment from 89.9 to 94.1% and the ROC integral increasing
from 0.958 to 0.981. Applying the system to predict promot-
ers in the genome, Table 2 shows the clear improvement we
obtained on our curated benchmark test set of 92 promoters
from the Adh region (22). In comparison, other state-of-
the-art predictors (14) achieve a performance similar to our
previous one-model system. The results indicate that we
may finally have arrived at a point where we begin to
understand the core promoter architecture. For instance, at a
detection level of two-thirds, false predictions were made at a
frequency of one per gene (the average gene density in
Drosophila is 1 in 9 kb). Using this threshold corresponding
to 64% true positives, we made 35 000 predictions in the
non-repeat-masked release four of the D.melanogaster gen-
ome in total. Table 3 shows the breakdown how often each
of the five different core modules was predicted. Compared
to the final partitioning of in the training data, the TATA module
was predicted more frequently across the whole genome
(36% versus 20%), with fewer predictions seen for all other
modules. Applied to the Drosophila pseudoobscura genome,
McPromoter also predicted all five subclasses, but with some
distinct differences in their frequency.
Taken together, our results show (i) that a dramatic
improvement in promoter prediction accuracy is achieved
when taken the variable structure of core promoters into
account; (ii) that additional, as yet not fully experimentally
validated, promoter motifs play an important role in this;
and (iii) that these different architectures are likely conserved
across different fly species.
DISCUSSION
It has been argued that identifying TSSs without including
some model of the gene structure means to deliberately
exclude helpful information. For instance, one system
which included features of the first exon reportedly improved
on previous approaches (27). For the purpose of accurate
annotations of protein-coding genes, this may in fact be an
advantageous approach. However, one has to remember that
the cell does not know about codons or splice signals at the
stage of transcription initiation, and coupling with protein-
coding gene models will limit predictions to this class of
genes, ignoring other pol-II TSSs like those for miRNAs.
In this sense, there is a distinction between the predictions
of 50-untranslated regions (50-UTRs) (28) and core promoters.
For computational investigations of the biology of gene regu-
lation, it makes sense to use only the information available to
the cell, and model the core promoter region using sequence-
derived features such as arrangements of specific TFBSs.
This is in analogy to recent ‘splicing simulators’ (29) which
aim to recapture the process of splicing of a primary tran-
script without explicitly using coding models, but rather
based on motifs which interact with components of the
spliceosome. Note that this does not mean that such core
promoter information cannot include sequences downstream
of the TSS; in fact, any DPE and MTE motifs are part of
the mRNA transcript.
Computational methods which aim at the identification of
core promoters in this way have traditionally been classified
as belonging to one of two groups, depending on how the
model captures promoter features (30):
 Search-by-signal algorithms make predictions based on the
detection of core promoter elements such as the TATA box
or the initiator, and/or TFBSs outside the core region (31).
 Search-by-content algorithms identify regulatory regions
by using measures based on the sequence composition of
promoter and non-promoter examples (32).
Search-by-content and hybrid methods combining both
ideas have turned out to be more successful than signal-
based systems. In the light of our and other recent studies
which address the variability of the core promoter regions,
this is no longer surprising; approaches which e.g. explicitly
expect a TATA box (33) cannot be very successful, given that
this motif is lacking in the majority of promoters. In retro-
spect, the weak performance of predictors of a decade ago
was to a large extent due to our lack of data and biological
knowledge, rather than due to poorly designed computational
approaches.
Today, there is no a priori advantage or disadvantage for
either one paradigm—which method is chosen will depend
on the particular organism and how much is known about

To enable a fair comparison, the evaluation is done on the same dataset and
annotation as in previous publications. Sn: sensitivity, i.e. fraction of correctly
identified TSSs among the set of annotated start sites. A TSS is counted as
correct if one or more predictions fall within a window of [500, +50] of the
50 end of genes in the set. Sp: specificity, i.e. fraction of correctly identified
TSSs among the set of total predictions, where predictions are counted within
the regions spanned by the genes. FP rate: false positive rate, i.e. the frequency
of additional predictions per nucleotide. Numbers for the one-model
McPromoter and Sharan and Myers were adapted from Ref. (14).

its functional promoter elements. For Drosophila, we now
have an initial comprehensive set of core motifs at our dis-
position. It is not unlikely that future analyses may discover
additional sequence motifs preferentially targeted by compo-
nents of general transcription factors. In particular, 15% of
the promoters in our curated set do not show strong matches
to the core promoter elements in our list. A very recent study
has revisited our analysis of Drosophila core promoters in this
regard (34), using a larger (albeit not curated) collection of
putative TSSs. In addition to the motifs we identified and
made use of in this paper, the authors identified new ele-
ments: putative variants of DPE and Inr, as well as one posi-
tionally restricted and two positionally unrestricted motifs, all
of which are present in relatively few core promoters com-
pared to the previously known motifs. Motivated by the
increasing evidence of the modularity of core promoters,
our approach to base promoter prediction on a collection of
several models instead of only one turned out to be very suc-
cessful: It surpasses the accuracy of our previous results and
other Drosophila predictors, and to our best knowledge,
achieves the most reliable core promoter predictions for a
single eukaryotic species (Table 3). Further improvements
to this model can include these recently identified addi-
tional motifs, or deviate from a strictly parallel collection
of architectures to include motifs such as MTE which do
not appear to be part of one particular module only. From a
computational view, it will also be interesting to apply model
selection techniques, i.e. to automatically derive a set of
suitable core promoter architectures, instead of initializing
them manually as we did in this study.
Eukaryotic genes may be controlled by several alternative
promoters, leading to transcript initiation from multiple
distinct start sites. Increasing evidence shows that this is a
widespread phenomenon, in organisms ranging from rice to
human (35–37). The availability of several promoters may
provide a mechanism for more refined expression patterns
such as limitation to several tissues. Current large-scale
experimental data however suggests that the very concept
of a transcription start ‘site’ is much looser than anticipated;
it may not exist for a large number of genes in higher
organisms, at least not in the traditional view as precise site
defined by functional motifs. High throughput mammalian 50
SAGE/CAGE data show a broad distribution of initiation
events. In fact, the majority of human and mouse genes
appear to have more than one distinct start site or a diffuse
start ‘region’, and a large number of additional events are
observed in close proximity, with the notable exception of
TATA box containing promoters (38). For many human
genes, it may simply not be functionally important where
exactly the start of transcription occurs, as long as it does
not lead to the inclusion of sequence in the primary transcript
which has an effect on its post-transcriptional processing. The
distinction between an alternative and an imprecise start may
not be easy in some cases, but it may be possible to assess the
importance of some alternative sites by conservation across
species. In light of recent reports on wide-spread intergenic
transcription (39), using a second genome does not only
serve to filter out false positive predictions, but rather to
determine which elements are likely to have a function
because they have been conserved. With our current classifier
accuracy (94% equal recognition rate), it is thus our opinion
that many remaining computational ‘false predictions’ in
genomic DNA may in fact serve as functional TSSs under
the right circumstance, or that they could do so, but that
e.g. the chromatin structure renders them inaccessible to the
transcriptional machinery (40).
Why is the core promoter architecture in Drosophila so
variable, given that it should only serve to recruit the poly-
merase to the start of the gene? One scenario sees this vari-
ability as serving to regulate different subsets of genes on a
high level, e.g. through the replacement of TBP by TRFs,
and recent studies could show associations of sequence
motifs with GO categories (16) and additionally expression
data (34). Different core promoter architectures also allow
for communicating selectively with distal enhancer regions
and specific transcription factors (41). The complex structure
of TFIID and the core promoter regions may thus serve as
modular machinery that allows for an integration of informa-
tion from different cis-regulatory modules. A still possible
alternative scenario is that the diversity is frequently a side-
effect of TFIID consisting of many subunits, many of
which allow for specific interactions with DNA sequence
motifs, but which are often interchangeable with each other.
The large number of available Drosophila genomes will now
allow us to investigate those two scenarios.
In summary, the picture of transcriptional regulatory
regions as consisting of a fixed core promoter component
and a separate variable component defining specific expres-
sion patterns is undergoing a rapid change. Even the role of
pol-II as the only player in protein-coding gene expression
has changed with the recent discovery that an isoform of a
mitochondrial polymerase participates in the transcription of
nuclear genes in eukaryotes (42). The precise set of genes
regulated in this way, as well as the cis-elements and trans-
factors assisting in their transcription, have yet to be deci-
phered. Computational methods have to be adapted to keep
pace with this and make the most of the increasing wealth
of data at our disposition.
