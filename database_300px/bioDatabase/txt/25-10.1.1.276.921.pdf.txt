ABSTRACT
DNA ligation is an essential step in DNA replication,
repair and recombination. Mammalian cells contain
three DNA Ligases that are not interchangeable
although they use the same catalytic reaction mech-
anism. To compare the recruitment of the three
eukaryotic DNA Ligases to repair sites in vivo we
introduced DNA lesions in human cells by laser
microirradiation. Time lapse microscopy of fluores-
cently tagged proteins showed that DNA Ligase III
accumulated at microirradiated sites before DNA
Ligase I, whereas we could detect only a faint accu-
mulation of DNA Ligase IV. Recruitment of DNA
Ligase I and III to repair sites was cell cycle inde-
pendent. Mutational analysis and binding studies
revealed that DNA Ligase I was recruited to DNA
repair sites by interaction with PCNA while DNA
Ligase III was recruited via its BRCT domain
mediated interaction with XRCC1. Selective recruit-
ment of specialized DNA Ligases may have evolved
to accommodate the particular requirements of
different repair pathways and may thus enhance
efficiency of DNA repair.
INTRODUCTION
Higher eukaryotes are challenged with various types of DNA
damage caused by replication errors, radiation, environmental
agents and by-products of cellular metabolism. Numerous
repair pathways re-establishing the genetic information are
known (1,2). An increasing number of proteins have been
identified and assigned to these repair pathways, but the
recruitment mechanisms and the spatio-temporal coordination
of these repair factors at DNA damage sites remains largely
unknown. One of the late steps in DNA repair is the joining
of breaks in the phosphodiester backbone of duplex DNA,
which is catalyzed by members of the DNA Ligase family.
The ATP-dependent DNA Ligase family comprises three
enzymes termed DNA Ligase I, III and IV, which all contain
a highly conserved catalytic domain responsible for the liga-
tion reaction. Although all three DNA Ligases use the same
basic reaction mechanism, they have distinct functions and
are not interchangeable (3,4).
DNA Ligase I is required for the joining of Okazaki
fragments during lagging strand synthesis and is implicated
in long-patch or replicative base-excision repair (BER) and
nucleotide excision repair (NER). The end-joining activity
of DNA Ligase I is directed to DNA replication sites by its
interaction with PCNA, a central component of the replica-
tion machinery. This interaction and localization is mediated
by the N-terminal PCNA-binding domain (PBD) of DNA
Ligase I (5,6). It has been shown that loss of DNA Ligase I
function, leads to abnormal joining of Okazaki fragments dur-
ing S-phase (7), defective long-patch BER (8) and reduced
repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous
recombination (9).
DNA Ligase III is implicated in short-patch BER and sin-
gle strand break (SSB) repair (SSBR) and forms a complex
with XRCC1 (10–12). XRCC1 and DNA Ligase III normally
exist as a preformed complex in vivo interacting via the
C-terminal BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domain of DNA
Ligase III (10,13–15). XRCC1 also interacts with PARP-1,
PARP-2, DNA polymerase b and PCNA (16) and appears
to act as a scaffold protein during BER. The unique zinc fin-
ger near the N-terminus of DNA Ligase III was shown to bind
DNA SSBs (17). Interestingly, this DNA Ligase III zinc fin-
ger shows homology with the two zinc finger motifs
of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which also bind
DNA strand breaks (11). Therefore, it was suggested that
binding of DNA Ligase III via its zinc finger may displace
PARP from the DNA break allowing access of DNA Ligase
III and other repair proteins to the DNA lesion (17). Recently
DNA Ligase III was also identified as a candidate component
of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) backup pathway
(B-NHEJ) (18) and might thus be implicated in double strand
break repair.
DNA Ligase IV is implicated in the NHEJ pathway and
forms a complex with XRCC4 (19,20). Cultured cells that
lack DNA Ligase IV are defective in V(D)J recombination

and show increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (21).
Inactivation of DNA Ligase IV in mice leads to embryonic
lethality, implying that DNA Ligase IV may have essential
functions during early mammalian development (21,22).
We investigated the recruitment of DNA Ligases to repair
sites in HeLa cells using a combination of microirradiation,
live cell microscopy and binding studies. We could detect
only a faint accumulation of DNA Ligase IV at laser-induced
DNA damage sites. Kinetic studies and deletion analysis indi-
cated that selective recruitment of DNA Ligase I and III
to specific repair pathways is mediated through interaction
with PCNA and XRCC1, respectively. These results suggest
that PCNA and XRCC1 play a central role in the spatio-
temporal coordination of repair factors and thereby
enhance the specificity and efficiency of DNA repair in
eukaryotic cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection
Human HeLa or HEK 293T cells and mouse C2C12
myoblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 50 mg/ml
gentamicin supplemented with 10 and 20% FCS, respec-
tively. For transfection, cells grown on m-slides (Ibidi) or
on gridded coverslips were cotransfected with jetPEI
(PolyPlus Transfection) or TransFectin transfection reagent
(Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were subsequently incubated for 24–48 h before per-
forming microirradiation and live cell analyses or immunos-
tainings. 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA
using TransFectin reagent (Bio-Rad) and incubated for 48 h
before immunoprecipitations.
Expression plasmids
Mammalian expression constructs encoding translational
fusions of human DNA Ligase I, human FEN1 and human
PCNA with either green (GFP) or red (RFP) fluorescent
protein were previously described (23). Red variants of the
previously described GFP-Ligase III (24) and GFP-XRCC1
(25) were generated by replacing GFP with RFP (26) and
termed RFP-Ligase III and RFP-XRCC1, respectively.
Deletion expression constructs were amplified by PCR with
primers containing a SalI and BamHI restriction site and sub-
cloned into the SalI and BamHI site of the peGFP-C1 vector
(Clontech) downstream of GFP. The Ligase I PBD-GFP con-
struct was made by subcloning oligonucleotides correspond-
ing to the first 20 amino acids of DNA Ligase I into the
EcoRI and XmaI site of peGFP-N2 (Clontech). The GFP-
Ligase IV construct was generated by cloning the human
DNA Ligase IV cDNA (11) into the peGFP-C1 (Clontech)
vector. DNA Ligase IV was amplified using the following
oligonucleotides as primers for the PCR: forward 50-gggg
gtc gac gct gcc tca caa ac-30; reverse 50-cccc gga tcc aat
caa ata ctg gtt ttc-30. The residues in bold indicate a SalI
and a BamHI site encoded in the forward and reverse primer,
respectively, for subcloning the PCR fragment into the SalI
and BamHI sites of the peGFP-C1 vector downstream of
GFP. PCR amplified sequences were verified by DNA
sequencing. The Ku70-GFP construct (27) was provided by
William Rodgers. In all cases expression was under the
control of the CMV promoter. All fusion proteins were tested
by expression in HEK 293T cells followed by western blot
analysis.
Immunofluorescence and chemicals
Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and
permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 5 min. The follow-
ing primary antibodies (diluted in PBS containing 2% BSA)
were used: anti-g H2AX (Ser139) rabbit antibodies (Upstate),
anti-PAR mouse monoclonal antibody (Trevigen), anti-DNA
Ligase III mouse monoclonal antibody (Gene-Tex), rabbit
affinity purified DNA Ligase I antibodies (5), anti-XRCC1
mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam) and anti-PCNA rat
monoclonal antibody. Primary antibodies were detected using
secondary antibodies (diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 2%
BSA) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 555 or 647 (Molecular
Probes). Cells were counterstained with DAPI and mounted
in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).
Microscopy
Time series were taken with a Leica TCS SP2/AOBS
confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a HCX
PL 63x/1.4 oil objective using a 488 nm Ar laser line and a
561 nm DPSS laser line. Before and after microirradiation
confocal image series of one mid z-section were recorded
at 2 s time intervals (typically 6 pre-irradiation and 150
post-irradiation frames) with a pixel size of 90 nm.
Images of fixed cells were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot
2 widefield epifluorescence microscope using a Zeiss Plan-
Apochromat 63x/1.40 oil objective and a cooled CCD camera
(Visitron Systems).
UVA laser microirradiation
Cells were either seeded on m-slides (ibidi) or on 40 mm
round coverslips and sensitized for microirradiation by
incubation in a medium containing BrdU (10 mg/ml) for
24–48 h. For live cell microscopy and irradiation round cov-
erslips were mounted in a POC live-cell chamber (Visitron
Systems). Microirradiation was carried out with a 405 nm
diode laser coupled into a Leica TCS SP2/AOBS confocal
laser scanning microscope. The 405 nm laser was set to maxi-
mum power at 100% transmission and was focused through a
UV transmitting Leica HCX PL APO 63x/1.40–0.60 oil
objective to locally irradiate preselected spots of 1 mm in
diameter within the nucleus for 1 s. For evaluation of the
recruitment kinetics, fluorescence intensities of the irradiated
region were corrected for background and for total nuclear
loss of fluorescence over the time course and normalized to
the pre-irradiation value.
Immunoprecipitations
HEK 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with expres-
sion plasmids as described. After 48 h the transfection rate
was checked by fluorescence microscopy. About 70–90% of
the cells were coexpressing the GFP and RFP fusion
constructs. For immunoprecipitations 2 · 107 cells were
harvested in ice cold 1· PBS, washed twice and subsequently
homogenized in 200 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM PMSF and
3524 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 12
0.5% NP40). After a centrifugation step (10 min, 20 000· g,
4C) the supernatant was adjusted with dilution buffer
(20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA,
2 mM PMSF) to 500 ml. Totally 50 ml were added to SDS-
containing sample buffer (referred to as input). For immuno-
precipitation 1 mg of a purified a-GFP antibody was added
and incubated for 2 h rotating at 4C. For pull down of
immunocomplexes 25 ml of equilibrated protein A agarose
beads (Amersham Pharmacia, NJ, USA) were added and
incubated for 1 h. After centrifugation (2 min, 5000· g,
4C) the supernatant was removed and 50 ml were collected
(referred to as non-bound). The beads were washed two
times with 1 ml dilution buffer containing 300 mM NaCl.
After the last washing step 100 ml of the supernatant was
collected (referred to as wash) and the beads were resus-
pended in 2· SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled for
10 min at 95C.
Western blot analysis.
For immunoblot analysis 1% of the input, the non-bound
and the wash fractions as well as 20% of the soluble super-
natants were separated on 12 or 10% SDS–PAGE and then
electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). The membrane was
blocked with 3% milk in PBS and incubated overnight at
4C with either a mouse monoclonal a-GFP antibody or an
a-mRFP rabbit polyclonal antibody. After washing with
PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, the blots were incubated
with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visual-
ized with ECL plus Western Blot Detection Kit (Amersham
Biosciences, NJ, USA).
RESULTS
DNA Ligase I and III accumulate at DNA repair sites
Ligation of DNA is the ultimate step in DNA repair to restore
genome integrity. To investigate the involvement of DNA
Ligase I and III in DNA repair we performed immunostain-
ings of microirradiated HeLa cells. We employed a confocal
laser scanning microscope to locally generate DNA damage
at preselected subnuclear sites in BrdU-sensitized cells. In
contrast to previous studies we used a long wavelength ultra-
violet 405 nm diode laser for microirradiation. Using specific
antibodies for different types of DNA damage we could
detect phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (gH2AX), a
marker for DSBs, at microirradiated sites. In addition, we
detected poly(ADP-Ribose) which is generated by PARP at
SSBs (Figure 1A). These results show that microirradiation
with a 405 nm laser generates a mixture of different types
of DNA damage that are substrates for different DNA repair
pathways involving either DNA Ligase I or III. Immunofluo-
rescence stainings with specific antibodies revealed that
endogenous DNA Ligase I and III as well as their binding
partners PCNA and XRCC1 are present at DNA damage
sites as early as 5 min after irradiation (Figure 1B and C).
These results demonstrate that this microirradiation technique
allows the direct comparison of factors from different repair
pathways within the same cell.
Recruitment kinetics of DNA Ligases at repair sites
The fact that DNA Ligase I and III although being involved
in different repair pathways are both present at microirradi-
ated sites raised the question whether they are recruited by
similar mechanisms. First hints for kinetic differences in
the recruitment of repair factors involved in SSB repair and
BER came from single measurements with GFP-fusion
proteins (28). To directly compare the recruitment kinetics
of DNA Ligase I and III we microirradiated BrdU-sensitized
cells and quantified the accumulation of different GFP- and
RFP-tagged proteins at DNA damage site (Figure 2). The
intensity values were corrected for background and for total
nuclear loss of fluorescence over the time course and normal-
ized to the pre-irradiation value. Mean values of at least eight
different cells are shown. A direct comparison of GFP- and
RFP-tagged Ligases showed a significantly slower recruit-
ment of DNA Ligase I in contrast to the very fast accumula-
tion of DNA Ligase III at microirradiated sites (Figure 3A
and B and Supplementary Fig3video1). Recruitment kinetics
of DNA Ligase I and III were independent of the fluorescence
tag as swapping of GFP and RFP gave similar results
(Supplementary Figure 1). To gain further insights into the
mechanisms underlying the different recruitment kinetics of
DNA Ligases to repair sites we extended our analysis to
their reported interaction partners. Since DNA Ligase I is tar-
geted to replication sites by PCNA in S phase we compared
the accumulation of DNA Ligase I with that of PCNA and
found similar recruitment kinetics (Figure 3C and D and Sup-
plementary Fig3video2). Both proteins showed a slow but
constant accumulation at DNA repair sites and fluorescence
intensities reached a maximum after 5 min. This suggests

that PCNA might be responsible for recruitment of DNA
Ligase I to sites of DNA repair.
Since biochemical studies had suggested an interaction
of DNA Ligase III with XRCC1 during short-patch BER
(10,13–15) we directly compared their recruitment to micro-
irradiated sites. Remarkably, we found that DNA Ligase III
and XRCC1 redistributed to sites of DNA damage with simi-
lar kinetics. After a very fast initial accumulation, intensities
of both proteins reached a maximum within 100–120 s after
irradiation and then began to decline. These observations sup-
port the idea that DNA Ligase III is targeted to DNA repair
sites through interaction with XRCC1.
To test whether DNA Ligase I and III not only differ
in their recruitment but also in their release kinetics we
performed long-term observations of irradiated HeLa cells
with 5 min time intervals to compare their release from repair
sites. After reaching a maximum the mean fluorescence inten-
sities of PCNA, XRCC1, DNA Ligase I and III decreased
gradually at the irradiated sites (Figure 4 and data not
shown). Both, DNA Ligase I and III reached basal levels
120 min after irradiation (Figure 4). We found similar
release kinetics for their respective binding partners PCNA
and XRCC1 (data not shown). This indicates that although
DNA Ligase I and III differ in their recruitment to repair
sites they show similar release kinetics.
Next we tested whether the recruitment of GFP-Ligase I
and GFP-Ligase III is cell cycle dependent. The characteristic
focal distribution of RFP-PCNA and GFP-Ligase I allowed

identification of S phase in living cells (29,30). Accumula-
tions of GFP-Ligase I and RFP-PCNA at DNA damage
sites could be observed in all S phase stages (Supplementary
Figure 2). We could also detect recruitment of RFP-PCNA
and GFP-DNA Ligase I to sites of DNA damage in mouse
C2C12 cells in S and non-S phase (Supplementary
Figure 3). These results indicate that DNA Ligase I and
PCNA are recruited with similar kinetics in both human
and mouse cells. We also observed accumulation of DNA
Ligase III in S phase cells (Supplementary Figure 4).
As laser microirradiation generates DSBs (Figure 1), we
tested whether DNA Ligase IV, which is involved in
NHEJ, gets recruited to laser-induced DNA damage sites.
We found only a very faint accumulation at repair sites
that was barely detectable and in some cases not distinguish-
able from the nuclear background of unbound GFP-DNA

least eight independent experiments. Error bars represent the SD. (A and B) Accumulation of DNA Ligase III at DNA repair sites precedes accumulation of DNA

Ligase IV (Supplementary Figure 5A). This is consistent with
earlier reports failing to detect recruitment of factors involved
in DSB repair like Ku70, DNA-PK and Smc (31). In agree-
ment with this report, we found that Ku70-GFP was not
recruited to DNA damage sites after 405 nm irradiation
(Supplementary Figure 5B). These results suggest that the
number of DSBs generated by microirradiation and the
stoichiometry of the repair complex yield only faint signals
that are barely above background and hard to analyse with
this experimental system.
Taken together, these results show that DNA Ligase I
and III are recruited to microirradiated sites with distinct
kinetics which match similar differences of their respective
binding partners. The recruitment of both DNA Ligases
occurred independently of the cell cycle stage in S and in
non-S phase cells.
Recruitment of DNA Ligase I to sites of DNA damage
depends on its interaction with PCNA
During S phase, DNA Ligase I is targeted to sites of DNA
replication via its PCNA-binding domain (PBD) (5,6). To
test whether PCNA also mediates recruitment of DNA Ligase
I during DNA repair, we deleted the PBD of DNA Ligase I
(GFP-Ligase I DPBD) and expressed the deletion construct
in HeLa cells together with full-length RFP-Ligase I. After
laser microirradiation GFP-Ligase I DPBD showed only
minor accumulation at irradiated sites compared to the wild

cell imaging of a microirradiated HeLa cell coexpressing GFP-DNA Ligase I DPBD and RFP-Ligase I. Deletion of the PBD in GFP-DNA Ligase I DPBD almost
completely abolishes recruitment to sites of DNA damage, whereas RFP-Ligase I accumulates at these sites as seen in Figure 3 (arrow). (C) A HeLa cell

(E) Coimmunoprecipitations were performed in 293T cells coexpressing different combinations of RFP and GFP fusion constructs. For interaction mapping the
same deletion constructs as in A–D were used. Immunoprecipitations were performed with an antibody against GFP. Precipitated fusion proteins were then
detected with specific antibodies against RFP and GFP on western blots. RFP-PCNA coprecipitated with GFP-Ligase I but not with GFP-Ligase III (left panel).
RFP-PCNA was also coprecipitated with Ligase I PBD-GFP but not with GFP-Ligase I DPBD (right panel).

type fusion construct (Figure 5A and B). This suggests that
the PBD plays a critical role in the recruitment of DNA
Ligase I to repair sites. The observed residual accumulation
of the deletion construct is likely owing to recruitment via
trimerization (32) with the endogenous or the full length
DNA Ligase I construct. To directly study the function of
the PBD we fused the PBD alone with GFP (PBD-GFP).
Besides association with replication sites, the PBD fusion
protein was recruited to sites of DNA damage with kinetics
similar to the full-length DNA Ligase I construct
(Figure 5C and D and Supplementary Figure 6).
These kinetic measurements of deletion constructs
indicated that recruitment to repair sites is mediated by
an interaction of the PBD of DNA Ligase I with PCNA.
To test this interaction we performed coimmunopreci-
pitation assays with the same constructs as used for live
cell microscopy. We found that deletion of the PBD aboli-
shed the interaction of DNA Ligase I with PCNA, while
the PBD alone was sufficient to coprecipitate PCNA
(Figure 5E). These lines of evidence strongly suggest that
the PBD-mediated interaction of DNA Ligase I with PCNA
is necessary and sufficient for targeting of DNA Ligase I to
repair sites.
To test whether this mechanism applies also to other
PCNA binding proteins we compared the recruitment kinetics
of DNA Ligase I with FEN-1, another PBD-containing pro-
tein involved in DNA replication and repair. After microirra-
diation FEN-1 accumulated at DNA repair sites with similar
recruitment kinetics as DNA Ligase I (Figure 6). These
results point to a common mechanism for the recruitment
of PBD containing enzymes like DNA Ligase I and FEN-1
in DNA replication and repair.
Recruitment of DNA Ligase III to sites of DNA damage
depends on its interaction with XRCC1
The unique Zn-Finger motif at the N-terminus of DNA
Ligase III binds to unusual DNA secondary structures and
it was suggested that this domain could recruit DNA
Ligase III to damaged DNA (17,33,34). We generated a dele-
tion construct of DNA Ligase III lacking the N-terminal ZnF
motif (GFP-Ligase III DZnF) and expressed this construct
together with the full length RFP-Ligase III in HeLa cells.
After microirradiation, no difference could be observed and
both fusion proteins showed similar recruitment kinetics
(Figure 7). We then tested whether the BRCT domain
of DNA Ligase III, which was described to be essential for
the interaction with XRCC1 (10,13–15) is required for
recruitment to repair sites in vivo. We generated a deletion
construct lacking the C-terminal BRCT domain of DNA
Ligase III (GFP-Ligase III DBRCT). This fusion protein did
not enter the nucleus but remained in the cytoplasm indicat-
ing that the BRCT domain is responsible for nuclear locali-
zation of DNA Ligase III (Figure 8E). After addition of an
SV40-NLS (GFP-N-Ligase III DBRCT) the fusion protein
entered the nucleus but showed, in comparison with the
full-length construct, only a minor accumulation at DNA
repair sites (Figure 8A and C). Having shown that deletion
of the BRCT domain abolishes recruitment of DNA
Ligase III, we next fused the BRCT domain alone to GFP
(GFP-BRCT). The BRCT fusion protein redistributed to

DNA Ligase I and FEN-1 are similar. The structure of the fusion
proteins is depicted in Figure 2. (A) Live cell imaging of a microirradiated

DNA repair sites and showed a similar although weaker accu-
mulation at these sites as the full-length DNA Ligase III
(Figure 8C and D). The slightly reduced accumulation of
the isolated BRCT domain could be explained by additional
protein sequences of DNA Ligase III enhancing recruitment
or proper protein folding.
To investigate the role of the BRCT domain in the inter-
action of DNA Ligase III with XRCC1 we performed coim-
munoprecipitation assays. We found that deletion of the
BRCT domain abolished binding of DNA Ligase III to
XRCC1, while the BRCT domain alone was sufficient for
interaction (Figure 8F). These data fit well with the results
obtained from kinetic measurements which altogether indi-
cate that the BRCT domain is necessary and sufficient
for recruitment of DNA Ligase III to repair sites while the
ZnF domain does not seem to be involved.
DISCUSSION
Different DNA repair pathways have evolved to deal with
various types of DNA damage caused by normal cellular
metabolism or exogenous factors. The common essential
step in all these different repair pathways is the joining of

DNA ends by members of the DNA Ligase family. Although
the catalytic core of DNA Ligase I and III is highly conserved
they have no or only poorly overlapping functions and are not
interchangeable (7–10,18,35). Extracts from the cell line
EM9 which is deficient in DNA Ligase III (10) are defective
in short-patch BER (12) while extracts from the DNA Ligase
I deficient cell line 46BR.1G1 (36) are defective in long-
patch BER (8). Furthermore, generation of partially DNA
Ligase I defective mouse embryonic stem cells revealed
that DNA Ligase III could not compensate for loss of DNA
Ligase I function in cell proliferation (35).
To explore possible differences that could explain the non-
redundant functions of these highly homologous enzymes we
compared the recruitment kinetics of DNA Ligase I and III at
local DNA lesions generated by laser microirradiation. We
found that DNA Ligases I and III accumulated at DNA dam-
age sites with distinct kinetics suggesting that they catalyze
the same reaction but use different mechanisms for recruit-
ment. With deletion and binding studies we could demon-
strate that the PCNA binding domain (PBD) of DNA
Ligase I mediates targeting DNA repair sites. Interestingly,
the PBD is not required for enzyme activity in vitro but
rescue experiments with DNA Ligase I deficient cells demon-
strated that the PBD is essential in vivo (8,9,35). These results
suggest that PCNA mediated recruitment of DNA Ligase I
could enhance the efficiency of the ligation reaction in vivo
by locally concentrating DNA Ligase I at sites of replication
and repair.
In further studies, we also observed recruitment of FEN-1
to DNA repair sites, which like DNA Ligase I interacts with
PCNA during DNA replication (37,38) and is implicated in
long-patch BER (39,40). Remarkably, FEN-1 showed the
same recruitment kinetics as DNA Ligase I although it has
a completely different function in replication and repair.
Likewise, the PBD of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is
also necessary and sufficient for accumulation of Dnmt1 at
repair sites (24). Taken together our results show that various
PBD-containing proteins involved in the restoration of gen-
etic and epigenetic information are recruited to replication
as well as repair sites by PCNA.
On one hand, it has been proposed that the ZnF motif of
DNA Ligase III could act as a nick sensor, recruiting DNA
Ligase III to DNA nicks and altered DNA structures
(17,33,34). We found, however, that deletion of the ZnF
did not influence the recruitment kinetics of DNA
Ligase III. On the other hand, biochemical studies have
suggested that the BRCT domain of DNA Ligase III is
essential for its interaction with XRCC1 (10,13–15). Here,
we demonstrate that the deletion of the BRCT domain of
DNA Ligase III abolishes recruitment of DNA Ligase III to
repair sites in vivo. Moreover, the BRCT domain alone was
sufficient to mediate recruitment of the fusion protein to
DNA repair sites and is essential for nuclear localization of
DNA Ligase III.
These different mechanisms for the localization of DNA
Ligases at repair sites are consistent with specific characteris-
tics of the respective repair pathways. The continuous syn-
thesis of long stretches of DNA during long patch BER
resembles the process of DNA replication. Consequently,
also similar recruitment mechanisms seem to be used. In
both processes DNA Ligase I is recruited through interaction
with the sliding clamp and processivity factor PCNA. In con-
trast, replacement of just a single nucleotide during short
patch BER does not require a processive repair machinery
sliding along the DNA but rather a stationary repair complex
recruiting DNA Ligase III.
In summary, although DNA Ligase I and III share a highly
similar catalytic core, they have distinct functions in DNA
replication and repair and are not interchangeable. Here we
identified differences in the adjacent regulatory domains of
DNA Ligases which may explain their non-redundant
functions in eukaryotic cells. Thus, the PBD domain of
DNA Ligase I and the BRCT domain of DNA Ligase III
mediate interaction with PCNA and XRCC1, respectively,
and target them to different repair pathways (Figure 9).
This selective recruitment may contribute to the spatio-
temporal coordination of different repair factors and could
thus enhance accuracy and efficiency of DNA repair in
eukaryotic cells.

Figure 9. Model for selective targeting of DNA Ligase I and III to DNA
replication and different repair pathways. All DNA Ligases use the same
catalytic mechanism and show high sequence similarity in the catalytic core
(grey shading). The active site lysine residue (K) in the center of the catalytic
domain is directly involved in the ligation reaction. However, DNA Ligases
have non-overlapping functions in DNA repair and replication and are not
interchangeable. We could show that DNA Ligase I and III are targeted to
different repair pathways through their regulatory PBD and BRCT domains
which mediate interaction with PCNA and XRCC1, respectively. This
selective recruitment of specialized DNA Ligases may accommodate the
specific requirements of different repair pathways and thereby enhance repair
efficiency.
