Abstract
The present work was undertaken as part of the research in the 
Minerals and Metals Recycling research centre, MiMeR. The course 
of the thesis is attributed to metallurgical slags from the steelmaking 
industry and the possible use of such by-products as raw material for 
sulphoaluminate belite cement (SAB).  Implementing steel slags into 
the production of cement could contribute to the steel industry’s 
possibility of increasing the recirculation. In addition to the previous 
objective, the introduction of slag into the cement manufacturing can 
also facilitate the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions as well as 
lowering the overall energy consumption during the manufacturing. 
The reason for this is that the SAB system enables the reduction of the 
lime saturation factor (LSF) which in turn implies that less limestone 
is needed in the raw meal. Additionally, the firing temperature can be 
reduced by about 100-150 °C, since dicalcium silicate and 
sulphoaluminate are formed already at approximately 1200-1250 °C. 
In any event, one should remember that this is not intended to be a 
final solution for the recycling of slag, nor a replacement for already 
accepted cement materials. A number of applications currently exist 
where ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is used, but in cases where the 
OPC could be replaced with other type of cements, e.g. SAB cement, 
the possibility of using residues material in cement applications is 
increased. Considering the clinker covered within this work, possible 
applications are those where slow hydraulic properties are suitable.

The behaviour of high temperature reactions of tested mixtures was 
investigated using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with a 
quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mineralogical observations were 
carried out with x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM). The results  proved that steelmaking 
slags have the potential to work as raw material, since 
sulphoaluminate along with polymorphs of dicalcium silicate and 
ferrite phases were detected after firing at 1200 ºC in an air 
atmosphere.  
The hydraulic properties of the specimens were analysed through 
conduction calorimetry, XRD, differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) as was the mechanical strength of the specimens when 
hydrated for 2 and 28 days. The compressive strength was in 
accordance with that suggested in the literature for slow hardening 
SAB cement. Both mixtures tested behaved the same with regard to 
heat development as well as the amount of AFt formed during the first 
24 hours of the hydration.

Acknowledgements
Throughout my time so far as a Ph.D. student, there have been many 
faces passing by, hence, there are some persons to whom I in 
particular want to give a handshake. First, I would like to express my 
appreciation and gratitude to both my supervisors, Prof. Bo Björkman 
and Assistant Prof. Nourreddine Menad for great discussions, good 
comments on the work, and last but not least, their encouragement.  
I must confess that starting out as a Ph.D. student is not anything to be 
undertaken lightly, and probably not everybody’s cup of coffee. I 
believe most experience both good times and periods when everything 
seems to completely work against you. Those days, however, reveal 
the support of understanding colleagues which has certainly been most 
invaluable. Therefore, I want to thank all within the division of 
Process Metallurgy and especially emphasise the Ph.D. students,    
Mr. Fredrik Engström, Miss. Ulrika Leimalm, Tech. Lic. Ryan 
Robinson and Miss. Maria Lundgren who have been most helpful 
when needed. Besides that, I also want to thank them for many 
enjoyable times outside the offices. The work within MiMeR (through 
VINNOVA) has been very exciting, since most projects are in close 
collaboration with related companies. I have myself had the 
opportunity to work alongside many of the Swedish steelmaking 
companies, but especially Cementa AB, which is why I would like to 
give Mr. Erik Viggh many thanks for a lot of good ideas and guidance 
with regard to the approach of the project.

The final “Thanks” goes out, of course, to all mates and family, for 
great support and for just being there.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background 
There are good reasons for trying to implement the use of 
metallurgical by-products in the manufacturing of cement or 
alternatively as filler in the cement/concrete. One good reason is the 
limitation of a significant amount of slag being dumped each year. 
Another reason is the potential for decreasing energy consumption as 
well as decreasing carbon dioxide emissions within the cement 
industry.
So far steel slag has not been used very extensively in cement 
production. Recently, according to figure 1, only 1 % of the European 
steel slag was used for cement production in the year 2004 1. This 
might be partly explained in terms of classification as to whether it is 
considered as a product or waste. From a practical point of view, it is 
important to avoid fluctuations in the composition. Although the 
presence of free lime could be an advantage, acting as an activator if 
blended with Portland cement, it might still cause trouble in terms of 
expansion. Apart from free lime (CaO), MgO might also be the cause 
of volumetric expansion as it also reacts with water to form 
magnesium hydroxide and thereby limits the practical use of a cement 
within civil engineering. The volumetric factor is at least one 
limitation to be mentioned in relation to construction. Fluctuations

Alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) of which the 
sulphoaluminate belite cement (SAB) is an important option, have 
been and are still under investigation.  The advantage of producing 
SAB compared to OPC is the reduction of the lime saturation factor 
(LSF), which enables the reduction of CO2 emissions 3, but also the 
firing temperature which can be lowered by about 100-150 ºC 4. The 
latter is possible to accomplish since both sulphoaluminate and 
dicalcium silicate are formed at lower temperatures, at which 
tricalcium silicate is not formed.  Furthermore, since large amounts of 
steelmaking slags cannot be introduced into ordinary cement 
production due to heavy metals and free MgO (which in the OPC is 
suggested to be lower than 5 %), it is reasonable to look for alternative

compositions which are accompanied by the possibility of saving 
energy as well as decreasing the release of carbon dioxide emissions.   
A lot of research has been done in the field of SAB cement especially 
in the area of civil engineering. The use and development of sulpho- 
and ferroaluminate cements in China are, for instance, very well 
reviewed by Zhang et al. 5 . However, other investigations, where raw 
materials other than virgin materials are used, have been completed.  
Arjunan et al.6 obtained similar results as those obtained with OPC 
when using bag house dust, low-calcium fly ash (Class F fly ash) and 
scrubber sludge in different proportions.  The aim was to produce 
environmentally friendly cement. Low-temperature phases were 
detected and the usefulness was, for instance, confirmed by the 
compressive strength.  Another example comes from the properties of 
blended SAB cement as investigated by Zivica 7.  For the synthesis of 
SAB cement, a mixture of limestone, gypsum, fly ash and pyrite ash 
was used and heated at 1250 ºC. The SAB cement was further mixed 
with 5, 15, and 30 % granulated BF slag, fly ash, and silica fume, 
respectively.  It was partly concluded that SAB blends with additions 
of 5-15 % portions of pozzolana seemed to be optimal. Furthermore, 
the effect of blending was stated as being dependent on the activity of 
pozzolans and the properties of the SAB cement, in relation to the 
content of ȕ-C2S. A more theoretical work was performed by Majling 
et al.,8 where the objective was to forecast the mineralogical 
composition of SAB cement based on fly ash using modified Bouge 
computations. A relationship was established between the raw

material and the mineralogical composition of clinker material which 
was considered very useful in the further development of SAB 
cements based on fly ash. The present work is focused on the potential 
of steelmaking slag, when it is the major part of a raw material used 
for SAB cement.  Four different mixtures were prepared from various 
proportions of common steelmaking slags, i.e. MixA, MixB, MixC 
and MixD. The high temperature reactions in tested mixtures were 
investigated using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with a 
quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mineralogical observations were 
carried out using x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM). The hydraulic properties of the 
specimens were analysed through conduction calorimetry, XRD, 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as well as testing of the 
mechanical strength of the specimens when hydrated for 2 and 28 
days.
1.2 Ordinary Portland cement 
OPC is well known and traditionally used within the field of civil 
engineering. Additionally, the raw materials are rather cheap. 
However, since the raw meal is based on limestone and clay, the 
manufacturing is accompanied by a significant amount of carbon 
dioxide and high energy demands during firing of the raw meal and 
grinding of the final clinker. OPC consists of four major crystalline 
phases, see table 1.

Normally, the content of C3S is in the range of 50-65 %, C2S 15-25 %, 
C3A 8-14 % and C4AF 8-12 % 9. Silicates provide strength to the 
cement as it reacts with water. The strength of the material early on is 
due to the C3S, while C2S is of more importance after 28 days.  
1.3 Steelmaking slags 
Slag from the steelmaking industry can be generated either from 
integrated steel plants or scrap based steel production.  The different 
types of slag within the integrated plants are blast furnace (BF), basic 
oxygen furnace (BOF) and ladle slag. In scrap based production, the 
categorisation would entitle them: electric arc furnace (EAF), argon 
oxygen decarburisation (AOD), as well as ladle slag.  There are a 
number of reasons for using slag in the steelmaking process.  One 
purpose is to extract metal oxides and impurities from the metal bath 
into the slag. Additionally, it acts as a thermal insulator.

1.3.1 Generation of BF slag 
There have been different ideas of how to use slags within the cement 
area. Most widely used is the BF slag, which can be used either as it 
is, if granulated, or blended with OPC, i.e. slag cement.  
The BF process in Sweden is run with iron ore pellets, i.e. hematite, 
and it produces approximately 150 kg slag/t hot metal. Coke is used as 
a reduction agent as it produces CO (g) after reaction with oxygen. The 
overall reaction between CO (g) and iron oxide can be written as 
follows, Fe2O3+3CO(g)ĺ2Fe+3CO2 (g) 10. The liquid slag (when used for 
cement) is usually granulated (quenched in water) since the 
granulation offers a very amorphous material (glassy phase) which is 
easy to grind, resulting in excellent hydraulic properties. Main 
minerals which usually occur in this by-product are                        
melilite (2CaO·(Al,Fe)(Al,Si)O3·SiO2), merwinite (3CaO·MgO·2SiO2), and 
wollastonite ((Ca,Mg)O·SiO2) 11. It is, however, sometimes appropriate 
to further activate the slag by increasing the lime content and thereby 
the basicity or by other means. Generally, granulated BF slag is 
considered to have slow hardening hydraulic properties if compared to 
OPC. However, tests of highly aged slag have proven that it becomes 
at least as strong as OPC does after 28 days of hydration and 
thereafter, it continues to increase in strength and does not level off as 
the OPC does 12.

1.3.2 Generation of BOF slag 
In the BOF converter, the melted iron is mixed with steel scrap. 
Thereafter, oxygen with reasonably high pressure is blown towards 
the surface of the melt in order to reduce the carbon content. There 
are, however, techniques where oxygen can be injected from the 
bottom too. At this stage of the process, slag formers are added as well 
i.e. burned lime and/or dolomite lime.  The most important reactions 
taking place are 13,
SiFe+ O2ĺ SiO2 (slag) 
MnFe+ 1/2O2ĺ MnO (slag) 
Fe+1/2O2ĺ FeO (slag) 
CFe+ 1/2O2ĺ CO (g) 
Other elements such as vanadium and phosphor are converted into 
oxides in the slag as well. In order to dissolve the lime more quickly it 
is possible to add CaF2. The latter enables the reduction of the melting 
point of the lime. As the lime dissolves into the slag, the viscosity will 
increase. Consequently, the fluidity of the slag starts to decrease 
compared to the properties of the individual constituents, mainly SiO2,
MnO and FeO. At the time the steel is being tapped from the 
converter, some alloying elements are added. BOF slag is normally air 
cooled and consists basically of C3S, C2S, (Fe, Mg, Mn)O, C2F and 
free lime. Most of the iron occurs mainly as wuestite (FeO) but can

also be present as hematite 14. The BOF slag most often does not 
disintegrate, i.e. no phase transformation of ȕ-C2Sĺ Ȗ-C2S, since the 
phosphor has a stabilising effect on the ȕ-C2S 14. In those cases where 
the slag consists of a high amount of C3S, the tricalcium silicate 
usually decomposes to the non-hydraulic and disintegrating Ȗ-C2S due 
to slow cooling conditions. However, free lime and periclase hydrate 
when in contact with water. As a result, the use and availability in the 
field of civil engineering is limited due to volumetric expansion. 
Possible variation in the composition is usually dependent on the raw 
materials used, as well as the practice in both process and slag 
handling. The typical level of BOF slag produced within a Swedish 
steel plant reaches about 100-120 kg per tonne of steel. 
_______________________________________________________1. Introduction

1.3.3 Generation of EAF slag 
EAF slag originates from the electric arc furnace, which is a unit 
operation within the scrap based steelmaking production. The 
formation of slag is essentially based on additions of burned lime, 
dolomite and possibly also fluorspar and sand, 11. In Sweden, the slag 
is produced in the ratio of approximately 90 kg per tonne of steel, on 
average. It is generally accepted that the hydraulic properties of these 
slags increase with higher basicity, i.e. higher content of CaO. If 
dolomite is used during the process, the presence of MgO will 
increase as well 15. The main difference between BOF slag and EAF 
slag is probably the presence of free lime which in EAF slags is of a 
lower magnitude. However, the amount of free MgO that remains in 
the slag gives problems with regard to volumetric expansion. Primary 
minerals to be found in the final slag are merwinite (C3MS2), (Fe, 
Mg)2SiO4, C3S, C2S, C4AF, C2F and solid solutions of (Ca, Fe, Mn, 
Mg)O 16.
1. Introduction_______________________________________________________
10
1.3.4 Generation of AOD slag 
The principal difference between the AOD process of stainless steel 
production compared to the BOF at integrated steel plants is the use of 
Ar-gas in addition to oxygen. The reaction between an oxygen-argon 
mixture and the steel bath lowers the carbon content in the steel bath, 
while at the same time, the oxidation of chromium to the slag can be 
kept at a low level. In the beginning of the operation, silica and 
manganese originating from the scrap is oxidised. After the blowing 
operation, the slag will consist of these elements along with the 
addition of lime and usually also fluorspar, made during the process. 
The top-slag (after the decarburisation period) usually reaches a level 
of 70 kg per tonne of steel 17.
1.3.5 Generation of secondary metallurgical slags 
There are different kinds of secondary metallurgical slags, i.e. slags 
from the refining of the steel in ladle metallurgy. The composition 
might vary somewhat depending on the steel grade, but the final 
mineralogical composition can be summarised as follows: dicalcium 
silicate, merwinite, calcium aluminates, as well as free lime and 
periclase.

1.4 Sulphoaluminate belite cement 
SAB cement refers to the phase assemblage S-A-S-C 18, and the 
major phases present within the system are given in table 2. Since the 
belite phase (C2S) itself does not bring any high early strength to the 
cement activation of the hydration mechanism is needed 3. Basically, 
this is the role of sulphoaluminate ( SAC 34 ) as its properties substitute 
for those of tricalcium silicate in order to provide sufficient early 
strength. Depending on what properties are required for a specific 
application, the quantity of each phase present can be adjusted. High 
amounts of sulphoaluminate provide high early strength to the cement, 
but it also contributes to good corrosion resistance and controllable 
expansion 5. Generally, raw materials used for this type of cement are 
limestone, bauxite and gypsum, which are calcined at                    
1300-1350 ºC 19. Another possible alumina source according to                        
Glasser and Zhang 19 could be red mud, a by-product from the Bayer 
process.

1.4.1 Hydration of dicalcium silicate 
Dicalcium silicate contributes to the late strength of the cement, as in 
OPC. The hydration product produced is very similar to the calcium 
silicate hydrate gels (C-S-H) formed through tricalcium silicate 20,
according to the following overall reactions (5) and (6) 21,
2C2S + (1.5+n)H ĺ C1.5+mSH1+m+n + (0.5-m)CH,  (5) 
analogous to, 
C3S + (2.5+n)H ĺ C1.5+mSH1+m+n + (1.5-m)CH (6) 
Since calcium sulphate is present, the C-S-H might be slightly 
modified in terms of having some sulphate incorporated in the 
structure 21.
_______________________________________________________1. Introduction
13
1.4.2 Hydration of sulphoaluminate 
The function of sulphoaluminate is the same as for tricalcium silicate 
in Portland cement, but forms instead ettringite ( 3236 HSAC ) also 
abbreviated AFt, after reaction with calcium sulphate and water. Both 
of the following reactions give the overall hydration mechanism for 
sulphoaluminate, however, the second one is considered in case of 
expansion 22.

1.4.3 Hydration of the ferrite phase 
In OPC, tricalcium aluminate reacts very quickly with water and 
gypsum to form AFt. Further on, AFt continues to react with C3A to 
form monosulphate (AFm). The ferrite phases follow the same 
sequence as tricalcium aluminate, but much more slowly, with respect 
to the formation of AFt. The overall reaction can be written according 
to reaction (9) (unbalanced), 
C4AF + 3C SH2 + 26H → 3236 HSF)(A,C              (9)
(7) 
(8) 
1. Introduction_______________________________________________________
14
Still, this is also a relatively rapid reaction and takes place at the very 
early stage of hydration. As in the case of C3A, C4AF forms AFt and 
contributes both to the early and late strength of the cement in the 
SAB system 18. Since no tricalcium aluminate is present in the SAB 
system, there will be no competition between the two phases 
regarding the reactivity with calcium sulphate 20 and, thus, the ferrite 
phase will be considerably more reactive in the SAB cement in 
comparison to the OPC system. In addition, the absence of C3A also 
prevents a reaction between the latter and ettringite to form 
monosulphate.
_______________________________________________________1. Introduction
15
1.4.4 Hydration periods 
Considering OPC, different periods are usually discussed in the 
following order: the initial period, the dormant period, the acceleration 
phase, the deceleration phase, and an ever-slowing reaction phase 23.
In the first period, hydrolysis and release of ions into the solution take 
place, and the reactions are characterised as very rapid and  
exothermic 20. Within the first couple of minutes, the heat evolved is 
due to the hydration of sulphate, the formation of AFt, as well as the 
wetting 24. Then, after the dormant period, which might last between 
30 minutes and 2 hours, the next heat liberated is attributed to the 
hydration of C3S, and after approximately 12-15 hours of hydration, 
AFt will react with aluminates to form “monosulphate” (AFm) 24. An 
important difference between the OPC and the SAB system is the final 
products. The SAB paste generally is constituted by AFt, AFm, 
alumina, and ferrite gel 5. The AFt phase, however, is not a final 
product of the OPC paste.  The hydration periods previously discussed 
are believed to be somewhat applicable to the SAB system as assumed 
in the further discussion.

Steelmaking slags and additives were combined according to table 3, 
as predicted by using modified Bouge calculations.  The calculation is 
based on a chemical analysis from which a mass balance can be 
performed.  Since there are five initial phases to be considered, the 
mass balance contained five different linear equations according to the 
general matrix given below,

The variables in the matrix refer to the weight fraction of each oxide 
in question, in relation to the actual mineral it makes up. Thus, a11=
(MCaO/MC2S) and b1= total fraction CaO, i.e. the amount given from 
chemical analyses, and, finally, the x1= C2S phase can be calculated. 
The same method is applied to SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and SO3. From this 
system of equations, the potential phase composition can be estimated 
by finding the inverse matrix, A-1, when det(A) 0. Since this is only a 
mass balance, there are no thermodynamic or kinetic considerations 
within the calculations.

Four mixtures were prepared, i.e.  MixA, MixB, MixC, and MixD (see 
table 3).  The fractions of each slag given within each mixture 
exemplify possible combinations giving the desirable phase 
composition i.e. the fractions given are not a unique solution, and thus 
other combinations are possible as well. The aim of this work was to 
combine different slags in such a way that it could demonstrate the 
potential of all kinds of steelmaking slags. MixA contained 70 % slag, 
of which 55 % was AOD slag and 15 % ladle slag, along with 
limestone, gypsum and an alumina rich material, containing 10 % of 
each additive. MixB contained 64 % slag, of which only 14 % 
represents AOD slag in this mixture.

The rest of the slag content consisted of 25 % ladle slag and 25 % 
EAF slag, resulting in a higher total amount of additives, i.e. 25 % 
limestone, 6 % alumina and 5 % gypsum.  MixC was more or less the 
same as MixB. The only difference was the substitution of 14 % AOD 
slag by BOF slag. Finally, MixD only consisted of ladle slag.

In table 4, the analysed chemical composition of each mixture is 
presented, along with the calculated potential phase composition. It is 
important to point out that, in the chemical analyses, iron is given as 
Fetot and sulphur as elemental, S0. However, in the mass balance 
discussed, these elements have been recalculated as Fe2O3 and SO3
and, thus, all iron present is assumed to be Fe2O3 and sulphur, as SO3.
In addition, since only five linear equations have been chosen, the 
total phase composition of the desired phase assemblage will not be 
100 %.

The result of the mass balance indicates that, dicalcium silicate is 
expected to be one the dominating mineral in each mixture. The main 
difference is the amount of ferrites and sulphoaluminate. Both MixB 
and MixC give a considerably higher amount of ferrites, i.e. 39 wt-% 
and 48 wt-% respectively, while sulphoaluminate is estimated to be   
26 wt-% in MixA and 38 wt-% in MixD. 
2.1.1 Particle size distribution 
The fineness of samples before and after firing was determined by a 
Malvern 2000, which is an optical sizing unit, and the measurement 
was performed by Cementa Research AB, Sweden. Figure 5a-d, in 
paper 1 show the particle size distribution before firing.  These figures 
reveal that MixB gives a d50§15 ȝm while other mixtures reach  
approximately d50§20 ȝm.

2.2 Experimental procedure 
2.2.1 Thermal analysis 
The measurements of the thermal analysis coupled with quadrupole 
mass spectrometer, QMG 420, were carried out simultaneously using 
the Netzsch STA 409 equipment shown in figure 2. 100-mg test 
materials were contained in an alumina crucible and subjected to a 
programmed heating of 10 K/min in an air atmosphere, in the 
temperature range of 25 to 1400 °C. A TG/DTA (thermogravimetric 
and differential thermal analyses) sample holder with an alumina 
crucible was positioned on a radiation shield in order to protect the 
balance. In order to correct for the Buyonce effect, an empty crucible 
was run (correction data) before analysing the sample, i.e. the 
investigated samples were tested in the mode TG/DTA sample + 
correction. The gases formed during the reaction were identified using 
quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) measurements connected to the 
STA equipment. In a high-frequency, quadrupole electric field, it is 
possible to separate ions according to their mass/charge ratio.

2.2.2 Sample preparation and firing of briquettes 
Each slag was crushed, using a jaw crusher, and divided into 
representative samples using a rotary splitter and ground in a rod mill 
for approximately 25 minutes. The slags were further combined to 
produce the mixtures given in table 3. In order to get a good 
homogenisation and a fairly fine powder-like material, the mixtures 
were once again introduced to a rod mill and run for approximately 60 
minutes. The ground mixtures were prepared as briquettes with the 
approximate dimension of ØxH, i.e. 2x4 cm before firing in order to 
get good contact between particles and then dried in an oven for        
24 hours at 100 ºC. The briquettes were fired in a furnace with an air 
atmosphere at 1200 ºC for approximately 30 minutes followed by

water cooling. The cooled briquettes were dried in an oven for          
24 hours at 100 ºC and then examined by x-ray diffraction, XRD and 
scanning electron microscopy, SEM. 
2.2.3 XRD and SEM analyses 
A Siemens D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer with CuKĮ radiation 
at 40 kV and 40 mA was used in order to identify crystalline clinker 
phases before and after firing of briquettes. The analyses were run 
with step scan, i.e. 4 seconds per step in the sin2ș-range 10-90°.
Observations of sulphoaluminate and AFt in the investigated samples 
were performed with SEM using a Phillips XL 30 equipped with 
energy dispersive spectra, EDS in the 20 keV range.  The material was 
first dispersed (10 - 20 mg) in a few millilitres of ethanol, and then, 
while sonicating, a sample of the pulp was taken out with a pipette. 
One drop was placed on a double sided carbon tape. Thereafter, the 
samples were sputter coated with gold.

2.2.4 Conduction calorimetry 
Isothermal calorimetry was performed on a TAM air (Thermal 
Activity Monitor) instrument from Thermometric using glass 
ampoules.  The instrument is an 8-channel heat flow calorimeter for 
heat flow measurements in the milliwatt range and the measurement 
was performed on mixtures and an ordinary Portland cement. 
Duplicate samples were performed using, 100 ml /sample with a w/c-
ratio =0.5 for 24 hours at 20 ºC. The tests were performed by Cementa  
Research AB, Sweden. 
2.2.5 Preparation of mortars 
The fired briquettes were ground with a rod mill for 25 minutes 
followed by a vibration mill for 25 minutes. Next, the material was 
run through a magnetic separation and then divided into three 
representative samples using a Jones riffle. In one of the dividers, 5 % 
gypsum was added, and in a second one, 10 % gypsum was added, 
while the third sample was left untreated with regard to the addition of 
gypsum. The three dividers were then once again ground separately 
with a vibration mill in order to get a close particle size distribution 
and good homogenisation of those to which additions of sulphate were 
made. Finally, material from all three of the samples was taken out 
using a Jones Riffle for further determination of the particle size 
distribution of each sample.

2.2.6 Compressive strength
Mortar prisms with the dimension of 25x25x285 mm were prepared 
and tested by Cementa Research AB, Sweden. The material was 
blended with sand and water in the ratio 3:1:0.5 and hydrated for 2 
and 28 days. In the first 24 hours, the mortars cured in a moisture 
chamber with 95 % relative humidity at 20 °C. Thereafter, the moulds 
were cured in water at 20 °C until the mechanical strength was tested.  
2.2.7 X-ray diffraction, XRD, - observation of AFt 
Confirmation of AFt was carried out on a Phillips X'pert Pro 
diffractometer with CuKĮ radiation and an “X’celerator” detector. The 
scanning was made after 24 hours between 7-50° in the sin2ș-range
and performed by Cementa Research AB, Sweden.

2.2.8 Differential scanning calorimetry, DSC 
The DSC experiment was run on a DSC 7 Perkins Elmer Differential 
Scanning Calorimeter to analyse the formation of AFt. This was 
performed by mixing a sample with water, but in order to stop the 
hydration, acetone was added. Thereafter, the sample was filtered and 
the moisture mass which was left was ground and heated with the 
DSC instrument (20 °C/min) as well as analyzed by XRD in order to 
confirm the presence of AFt. The    tests    were    performed    by  
Cementa Research AB, Sweden.

27
The results show that the highest weight loss is obtained in the 
temperature range of 700-800 °C, see table 5. This weight loss is 
especially pronounced for MixB and MixC with about 9 wt-%, each. 
That implies a weight loss of approximately 7 and 5 wt-% more than 
was observed for MixA and MixD, where losses of only 4 and 2.5 wt-
% were reached, respectively. In any event, since more calcite exists 
from the start in MixB and MixC, it should consequently result in a 
higher percentage of weight loss at the given temperature. It also 
implies that much less CO2 is released compared to OPC, where the 
CO2 emissions generally reach about 40 %. In general, the calcination 
starts at 700 ºC, according to reaction (10), and the maximum is 
reached between 750-800 ºC, independently of the composition of the 
mixture in question (table 5).  
The Differential Thermogravimetry results, DTG (given in paper 1), 
show agreement with the corresponding gas emissions, i.e., the 
released moisture and carbon dioxide emissions, at the 
aforementioned temperatures. The last small effect at rather high 
temperature, i.e. 1300-1400 ºC, is related to the evaporation of sulphur 
dioxide due to the decomposition of gypsum. The SO2 emissions, 
however, were only registered in the case of MixA and MixC, which 
can also be seen from the results of the evaporated gases in table 5.  
Although MixB and MixC are very similar in composition and behave 
very much the same, no sulphur dioxide could be detected from MixB. 
The sulphur present is presumably consumed in the clinker formation. 
3. Results and Discussion______________________________________________
28
The weight loss for MixD in this temperature range was 0.05 wt-%, 
which is neglectably low.  
The various reactions taking place are partly related to the formation 
of sulphoaluminate. From a general point of view, the process, it starts 
at approximately 1000 ºC, according to reaction (11), and depending 
on which mixture is being used. In the context of kinetics, the firing 
conditions strongly influence the completeness of formation, as well 
as the amount of mineralising elements.  
In slags, where dicalcium silicate already is present, the polymorphic 
transformation of Ȗ ĺ Į’L usually takes place at 900 ºC and, 
furthermore, Į’Lĺ Į’H at 1180 ºC 25. These kinds of transition states 
also contribute to the observations made by DTA.  Subsequently, 
different reactions take place simultaneously resulting in overlapping 
endothermic and exothermic sequences. As a result, each peak 
obtained cannot be easily designated to a specific reaction, e.g. 
whether it is a matter of phase transformation or mineralising 
reactions occurring. Complete data with figures of the TG/DTA/QMS 
results are found in paper 1.

3.2 Furnace trials 
While all mixtures have white and grey nuances in colour before 
being fired, figure 3, the difference in composition becomes clear 
afterwards, indicating the formation of new phases in different 
proportions.  While MixA and MixD are somewhat light brown and 
light green, it can be noticed that MixB and MixC are rather dark 
brown (figure 3). The brown colour is especially sharp in the case of 
MixC.

3.3 X-ray diffraction, XRD 
XRD analyses were carried out in order to determine the clinker 
forming reactions that have occurred. The analyses of the investigated 
samples are summarized in table 6. In the raw material of MixA, XRD 
revealed the presence of calcite, merwinite, calcium silicate (non-
hydraulic), and akermanite as major phases.  After the mixture was 
fired, none of these phases appeared. Instead, sulphoaluminate, also 
referred as yeeliminite, was detected along with bredigite, which is an 
alpha’-structure of dicalcium silicate. Apparently, calcite reacted with 
alumina and sulphate to form the sulphoaluminate phase, as expected. 
It is not clear, though, to what extent the mayenite phase reacted with 
the calcium sulphate present, forming sulphoaluminate. In any event, 
since no mayenite or other alumina phase was detected afterwards 
with the exception of sulphoaluminate, its contribution to the 
formation of sulphoaluminate can be assumed. The latter is 
presumably applicable in the case of MixD, too. Without any additives 
at all, a single ladle slag fired at 1200 °C forms all the desired clinker 
minerals, along with some free periclase, already present from the 
start.  Since no alumina and sulphate were added, it is reasonable to 
assume that mayenite, being one of the major minerals in this 
material, reacts with gypsum to form sulphoaluminate. However, it 
could also be that the mayenite partly contributes to the 
brownmillerite formation in this case. Furthermore, in the ladle slag, 
tricalcium aluminate was found which also could contribute to the 
______________________________________________3. Results and Discussion
31
sulphoaluminate formation. Silicates present in MixA and MixD, such 
as akermanite and merwinite, are believed to be part of the formation 
of bredigite, and larnite, as would be expected. The raw meal of MixB 
and MixC contained the same minerals, but in different proportions. 
Apart from additives, the major phases detected were calcium silicate, 
mayenite, periclase and wuestite. Important differences were detected 
after firing. The clinker material of MixB agreed better with the 
estimated phase composition, according to the modified Bouge 
calculation, than MixC did. MixB gave higher intensities of 
sulphoaluminate and brownmillerite than MixC which instead 
contained a calcium magnesium alumina iron silicate structure.  All 
together, substituting AOD slag by BOF slag clearly influences the 
final composition. The latter, detail, however, does not generally 
imply that AOD slag is preferable.  
It is worthwhile to mention that the light green colour observed in 
figure 3 for MixA and MixD could be due to the non-hydraulic phase 
2C2S·CaSO4, which is not unreasonable to assume at the temperature 
in question, as Į’-C2S reacts with CaSO4 26. However, since this phase 
was not detected by XRD, the likely amount is approximately < 3 % 
otherwise it would have been detected.

3.4 Scanning electron microscopy, SEM, - observation of 
sulphoaluminate
SEM analyses were performed to actually view the presence of 
sulphoaluminate. Figure 4a-d, show the observations from the 
sulphoaluminate phase.  Figure 4a represents what was found in 
MixA, i.e. a hexagonal tabular structure 26, and the composition of that 
structure is confirmed by the energy spectra, EDS.  The same kind of 
structure can be seen in Mixes B-D, and is confirmed with EDS 
analyses (see figures 4b-d).  The general impression of the samples 
was that a larger amount of sulphoaluminate was formed in MixA, in 
comparison to MixB, MixC, and MixD.

3.5 Particle size distribution of mortars
From figure 5, it can be seen that all samples of MixB are clearly finer 
and possess lesser variation among individuals of the same mixture 
compared to those of MixA. All MixB-samples have a d80 ≅ 50 ȝm, 
while MixA 0% and MixA 10 %, approximately reach a d80 ≅ 80 ȝm, 
and MixA 5% a d80 ≅ 70 ȝm, i.e. somewhat finer. The difference is 
partly assumed to be due to the presence of a varying content of metal 
drops in MixA, but it could also be explained in terms of grindability. 
The magnetic separation of metal drops in the slag from production of 
ordinary steel is much easier than for those originating from the 
stainless steelmaking process. In MixA there is a substantial amount 
of AOD slag, i.e. 55 %. All MixB blends give an acceptable particle 
size distribution, and instead of differing among individual samples, 
the blends are very closely distributed. It is well known that the 
particle size is an extremely important parameter, since it has a 
considerable affect on the hydration mechanism and thereby the final  
strength of the cement/concrete.

3.6 Compressive strength 
The results for the compressive strength are listed in table 7. The 
value given for each mixture represents the mean value of four tests 
and was measured after 2 and 28 days, according to standards.   
Table 7. 
Compressive strength developed for each mixture of MixA and MixB after 2 and 28 
days of hydration. 
Compressive strength  (MPa)

MixB   0% Gypsum 3.7 12.0 
MixB   5% Gypsum 7.5 13.5 
MixB 10% Gypsum 7.6 12.3 
Apparently, all MixA samples possess hydraulic properties that are 
lower than those of MixB. The compressive strength of MixB is 
almost twice as high after two days of hydration. At the level of 28 
days of hydration, MixA 5% increased by 4.3 MPa, yielding 8.5 MPa, 
which is significantly lower than MixB 5%, the strength of which was 
determined to be 13.5 MPa. If no addition of gypsum was added, the 
mortar of MixB 0% measured 3.7 MPa after 2 days, but that is 
markedly higher than MixA 0%, which did not provide any strength at

all. However, even when gypsum was added, it did not bring a result 
as satisfactory as that of MixB, independent of the amount of gypsum 
added. In MixB, the composition is estimated to have approximately 
40 wt-% of calcium ferrite, but only about 10 wt-% is contained in 
MixA. The result of this is a remarkable difference in compressive 
strength. In this case, the ferrite phase provides both the early strength 
and the final strength of the SAB cement. It has been stated that 
calcium ferrite phases possess higher reactivity in SAB compositions 
compared to OPC 18.
The results show that mortars of MixB measured strengths in 
accordance to that suggested in the literature for slow hardening 
cement based on the S-A-S-C  system 18.  The results obtained also 
imply that there is a saturation point at about 5% with regard to the 
addition of gypsum. Going from 0% to 5%, there is a considerable 
increase in strength. If 10% of gypsum is added instead, the 
compressive strength remains almost the same as if 5% is added, 
regardless of mixture composition.

3.7 Conduction calorimetry 
Conduction calorimetry was performed on MixA 5% and MixB 5%, 
chosen based on the compressive strength results and on a commercial 
OPC. The heat generated from these samples as function of time is 
shown in figure 6. MixA 5% and MixB 5% give roughly the same 
pattern, although MixA 5% seems to react slightly faster for the first 
seven hours but does not release as much heat as MixB 5%. Still, both 
mixtures reach their maximum within 10 hours, after which both of 
them also start to level off. The OPC sample reacts much more than 
MixA 5% and MixB 5% and reaches its maximum after 
approximately 10 hours until it levels off. However, the heat liberation 
for OPC does not level off as quickly as in MixA 5% and MixB 5%.

The AFt is formed according to reactions (7), (8) and (9), i.e. water 
and calcium sulphate react with sulphoaluminate or ferrites instead of 
tricalcium aluminate. In this investigation, it is believed to be mainly 
reaction (7) that takes place in these mixtures in relation to the 
hydration of sulphoaluminate, since no calcium hydroxide is expected 
before mixing with water. However, polymorphs of C2S will 
contribute to reaction (8) through Ca2+ ions as C2S dissolves, hence, 
the Ca2+ ions react with OH - ions to form Ca(OH)2. Furthermore, 
there will be a contribution to AFt formation from the ferrite phases 
which follow the same sequence of reactions as the aluminates in 
OPC, though this reaction is reported to be much slower in rate. 
Considering the modified Bouge calculations, it can be assumed that 
the influence of heat developed due to hydration of ferrites is more 
pronounced in MixB than in MixA. As shown in figure 6, the first few 
minutes of heat liberation is the same for all samples. The initial 
period is characterised by wetting, producing very rapid exothermic 
reactions, as expected. The dormant period seems to last longer for 
MixB, but both MixA 5% and MixB 5% show a very strong and 
intense increase in reaction activity when the dormant period ends, 
while the acceleration period lasts at least 1.5 hours for both MixA 
and MixB. After approximately 10 hours, both MixA and MixB start 
to level off dramatically and the heat liberation becomes very weak 
further on.  Significant heat which is evolved in the early hours is 
related to the formation of AFt, and it is well known that a substantial 
amount of sulphoaluminate present in any SAB composition is 
consumed in parallel to AFt formation, i.e. 60-70 % of the 
3. Results and Discussion______________________________________________
42
sulphoaluminate is usually consumed within the first 24 hours 18. The
formation of AFt is not the only reaction which takes place, but it is 
surely the dominating reaction, as is supposed at early stages when 
SAB compositions hydrate. 
3.8 Measurement of AFt 
The formation of AFt was confirmed by the XRD patterns given in 
figure 7. MixA 5% and MixB 5% have a similar diffractogram and 
both give a much higher intensity of AFt than OPC. Furthermore, as 
expected, Ca(OH)2 can be observed for OPC, indicating the silicates 
are being dissolved when mixed with water.

The amount of AFt formation was analysed by differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC). The first peak, in figure 8 of each sample, belongs 
to acetone, and the heat accompanied with the AFt present was 
distinguished and identified at approximately 150°C. Since the 
amount could not be quantified, it is only the relative amount between 
the mixtures that can be evaluated. From figure 8, it can be noted that 
the amount of AFt is rather equal for MixA 5% and MixB 5% during 
the first 24 hours.
All together, it can be concluded that the formation of AFt after a few 
hours is more accelerated in MixA 5% and MixB 5% in comparison to 
the formation of AFt in OPC. The amount of tricalcium silicate in 
OPC tested is approximately 54 %, which is much more than the 
expected amount of sulphoaluminate in MixA and MixB. As a result,

the OPC obtained more lasting heat development, to which the ferrites

3.10 Concluding remarks MixA and MixB 
The first part of the work considered four different mixtures based on 
steelmaking slag. The investigation of hydraulic properties, however, 
only concerned MixA and MixB with different additions of gypsum. 
The reason for not investigating MixC and MixD was basically a 
matter of time. MixD, which only consisted of a ladle slag was chosen 
based on its original composition, i.e. high content of alumina in 
comparison to other slags, which is a very favourable property in this 
case. It would, however, not be realistic to produce a commercial 
clinker based on only ladle slag, since there cannot be sufficient of 
volumes provided. MixC and MixB were very close in composition 
with regard to the raw meal, but the final composition was considered 
to be more promising for both MixA and MixB, since both of these 
compositions agreed better with those estimated through the modified 
Bouge equations.  The latter, however, does not mean that MixC can 
be excluded based on the argument that it does not posses good 
hydraulic properties!
Regarding MixA and MixB, is it true that MixB would be preferable 
in comparison to MixA? From the compressive strength point of view 
it is true until 28 days of hydration. However, MixA consists mainly 
of dicalcium silicate and sulphoaluminate according to the XRD 
results, and it has already been stated that the properties of dicalcium 
silicate are of utmost importance for strength development after

46
28 days. The amount of dicalcium silicate in MixB is less, and 
therefore, it could be that the later strength development of MixB 
starts to level off earlier than MixA. As a result, it could be possible 
that MixA in the long term provides better strength than MixB, though 
that is something which needs to be investigated further. Finally, all 
mixtures tested are possible slag combinations, but at this stage of the 
investigation, the different mixtures are mainly aimed at highlighting 
the potential of slags as raw material, thus, optimisation is possible, 
depending on the requirements of any application that might be 
considered.

4. Conclusions 
• Steelmaking slags have potential to work as raw material for 
sulphoaluminate belite cement, (SAB cement). 
• The results from XRD reveals formation of clinker phases 
such as sulphoaluminate, SAC 34 , polymorphs of dicalcium 
silicate, i.e. Į’-C2S and ȕ - C2S, as well as ferrite phases.  The 
formation of sulphoaluminate was also confirmed through 
SEM-analyses. 
• After 2 and 28 days, the strength of MixB agrees with that 
suggested in the literature for a slow hardening SAB 
composition.  The reason for MixA being weaker until 28 days 
of hydration is believed to be a lack of ferrites in comparison 
to MixB.

5. Future work 
The future work is suggested to be focused on high temperature 
reactions with regard to clinker formation. In parallel, it is also of 
interest to simulate the production of SAB clinker in a rotary kiln. In 
order to do so, thermodynamic data of sulphoaluminate, i.e. Gibbs free 
energy, must be determined or estimated through known estimation 
rules since it is not available in the literature. Furthermore, if the slags 
are going to be used as raw meal in a production line, it is important to 
be able to control the production in terms of getting an even final 
product/composition. Therefore, it will also be important to 
investigate the quantification of clinker phases. Finally, the leaching 
behaviour of the mixtures must be considered and analysed with 
respect to the content of heavy metals.

Abstract
In the present work, slags from the steelmaking industry are described and considered as potential raw material 
within the field of sulphoaluminate belite cement (SAB). The objective is to investigate the possibility of using a 
substantial amount of steelmaking slags as raw meal in the manufacture of a sulphobelitic clinker. The aim is 
also to compare the influence of different slags in relation to the formation of sulphoaluminate and other clinker 
phases needed. The behaviour of high temperature reactions was investigated by using thermogravimetric 
analysis coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mineralogical observations were carried out through x-
ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Three different mixtures and a single 
ladle slag were prepared using modified Bouge calculations, which is characterised by the assessment of a 
potential phase composition in order to produce belite-rich cement activated with sulphoaluminate. The results 
so far prove that steelmaking slags have the potential to work as raw material, since sulphoaluminate along with 
polymorphs of dicalcium silicate and ferrite phases were detected after firing at 1200 ºC in an air atmosphere. 
Keywords: by-products, cement, sulphoaluminate 
21. Introduction 
Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is well known and traditionally used within civil engineering. Additionally, the 
raw material is rather cheap. However, since the raw meal is based on limestone and clay, the manufacturing will 
be accompanied by a significant amount of carbon dioxide and high energy demands during firing of the raw 
meal and grinding of the final clinker. 
OPC consists of four major crystalline phases, i.e. tricalcium silicate (C3S), dicalcium silicate (C2S), tricalcium 
aluminate (C3A), and tetracalcium aluminoferrite (C4AF), (see figure 1). Normally, the content of C3S is in the 
range of 50-65%, C2S 15-25 %, C3A 8-14 % and C4AF 8-12 % 1. Silicates provide strength to the cement as it 
reacts with water. The strength of the material early on is due to the C3S, while C2S is more of importance after 
28 days.

AREA OF PORTLAND CEMENT
3Slag from steelmaking industry can be generated either from integrated steel plants or scrap based steel 
production.  The different types of slag within the integrated plants are blast furnace (BF), basic oxygen furnace 
(BOF) and ladle slag. In scrap based production, the categorisation would entitle them: electric arc furnace 
(EAF), argon oxygen decarburisation (AOD) as well as ladle slag. Apart from the blast furnace process, the BOF 
and EAF slags are usually generated under oxidising conditions which contribute to the higher amount of iron 
content.  
There have been different ideas of how to use slags within the cement area. Most widely used is the                   
BF slag, which can be used either as it is or blended with OPC, i.e. slag cement. The slag is usually granulated 
since the granulation offers a very amorphous material which is easy to grind, resulting in excellent hydraulic 
properties. In any event, it is sometimes appropriate to further activate the slag by for instance increasing the 
lime content and thereby the basicity. The properties of BF slag regarding hydration and structure, are well 
described by Roy and Idorn, 1982 2.
Steel slag is distinguished from the BF slag with respect to the iron oxide content, but possible fluctuations in the 
composition along with excess of free lime is also something not totally unusual about this by-product 3.
According to authors, there are basically two ways to proceed. One option is to use steel slag as raw material, 
fired with clay and limestone. A second possibility refers to a non-calcining process, where steel slag is blended 
with OPC or, alternatively, combined with BF slag and gypsum. 
Generally, the chemical composition of steelmaking slags is very similar to that of OPC, i.e. all oxides present in 
OPC are also present in steel slags, 4.  There are important differences, though, from a mineralogical point of 
view. In addition of being rich in wuestite, the amount of tricalcium silicate, which is considered to be the most 
important phase in OPC, is usually very low 5. Instead, the predominant phases are polymorphs of dicalcium 
silicate but, also, different calcium (alumina) ferrites, solid solutions of (Ca, Fe, Mn, Mg)O, as well as olivine 
and merwinite 6. The amount of MgO in these slags is very dependent on the flux, as to whether dolomite or lime 
is being used in the steelmaking process 7.   
4So far steel slag has not been used very extensively in cement production. Recently, according to figure 2,  only  
1 % of the European steel slag was used for cement production in the year 2004. Partly, this might be explained 
in terms of classification as to whether it is considered as a product or waste. From a practical point of view, it is 
important to avoid fluctuations in the composition. Although the presence of free lime could be an advantage, 
acting as an activator if blended with OPC, it might still cause trouble in terms of expansion. However, apart 
from free lime, MgO might be the cause of volumetric unsoundness as it also reacts with water to form 
magnesium hydroxide. The volumetric factor is at least one limitation to be mentioned in relation to 
construction. Fluctuations though, can be compensated for if the material is blended with, for instance, ground 
granulated blast furnace slag 3.

Alternatives to OPC, of which the sulphoaluminate belite cement, SAB, is an important option, have been and 
are still under investigation. SAB cement refers to the phase assemblage SASC −−− 9, and the major phases 
present within the system are SCAF,C,SACS,C 4342  and C  (see figure 3).  Since the belite phase itself does not 
bring any high early strength to the cement, activation of the hydration mechanism is needed 10. Basically, this is 
the role of sulphoaluminate, SAC 34 , as its properties substitute for those of tricalcium silicate in order to provide 
sufficient early strength.  
Fig. 2. Use of steelmaking slags in Europe 2004 8.
5The advantage of producing SAB compared to OPC, is the reduction of the lime saturation factor (LSF) which 
enables the reduction of CO2 emissions 10, but also the firing temperature which can be lowered with about 100-
150 ºC 11.  It is possible to accomplish the latter since both sulphoaluminate and dicalcium silicate are formed at 
lower temperatures at which the tricalcium silicate is not formed. 
Depending on what properties are required for a specific application, the quantity of each phase present can be 
adjusted. High amounts of sulphoaluminate provide high early strength to the cement, but it also contributes to 
good corrosion resistance and controllable expansion 12. Generally, raw materials used for this type of cement are 
limestone, bauxite and gypsum, which are calcined at 1300-1350 ºC 13.  Another possible alumina source 
according to Glasser and Zhang 13 could be red mud, a by-product from the Bayer process.

6A lot of research has been done in the field of SAB cement and, especially, in the area of civil engineering. The 
use and development of sulpho- and ferroaluminate cements in China are, for instance, very well reviewed by 
Zhang et al. 12. However, other investigations, where raw materials other than virgin materials are used, have 
been completed.  Arjunan et al. 14 got similar results as those gotten with OPC when using bag house dust, low-
calcium fly ash (Class F fly ash) and scrubber sludge in different proportions.  The aim was to produce 
environmentally friendly cement. Low-temperature phases were detected and the usefulness was, for instance, 
confirmed by the compressive strength.  Another example comes from the properties of blended SAB cement as 
investigated by Zivica 15.  For the synthesis of SAB cement, a mixture of limestone, gypsum, fly ash and pyrite 
ash was used and heated at 1250 ºC. The SAB cement was further mixed with 5, 15, and 30 % granulated BF 
slag, fly ash, and silica fume, respectively.  It was partly concluded that SAB blends with additions of 5-15% 
portions of pozzolana seemed to be optimal. Furthermore, the effect of blending was stated as being dependent 
on the activity of pozzolans and the properties of the SAB cement, in relation to the content of ȕ-C2S.  A more 
theoretical work was performed by Majling et al. 16 where the objective was to forecast the mineralogical 
composition of SAB cement based on fly ash using modified Bouge computations. A relationship was 
established between raw material and the mineralogical composition of clinker material which is considered very 
useful in the further development of SAB cements based on fly ash. The present work, however, is focused on 
the potential of steelmaking slag, when it is the major part of raw material used for SAB cement. Since all of the 
different slags are believed to be able to meet the compositional requirements in relation to the content of 
dicalcium silicate, the materials are assumed to possess enough quality to work as a raw material for slow 
hardening SAB cement without any unreasonable amounts of additives in the raw meal.  At the same time, by 
combining different steelmaking slags, possible fluctuations can be compensated for as well as having the ability 
of providing enough of slag volumes.  
72. Material and experimental procedure 
2.1 Material 
Raw materials were combined according to table 1, as predicted by using modified Bouge calculations.  The 
calculation is based on a chemical analysis from which a mass balance can be performed.  Since there are five 
initial phases to be considered, the mass balance will contain five different linear equations according to the 
general matrix given below,

The variables in the matrix refer to the weight fraction of each oxide in question, in relation to the actual mineral 
it is being part of. Thus, a11= (MCaO/MC2S) and b1= total fraction CaO, i.e. the amount given from chemical 
analyses, and, finally, the x1= C2S phase can be calculated. The same method is applied to SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3
and SO3. From this system of equations, the potential phase composition can be estimated by finding the inverse 
matrix, A-1, when det(A) 0. Since this is only a mass balance, there are no thermodynamic or kinetic 
considerations within the calculations.  
Four mixtures were prepared, i.e.  MixA, MixB, MixC, and MixD (see table 1).  MixA contains 70 % slag, of 
which 55 % is AOD slag and 15 % ladle slag, along with limestone, gypsum and an alumina rich material, 
containing 10 % of each additive. MixB contains 64 % slag of which only 14 % represents AOD slag, in this 
mixture.

* The alumina source consists approximately of 5 wt-% CaO, 74 wt-% Al2O3
     and 21 % SiO2
8The rest of the slag content consists of 25 % ladle slag and 25 % EAF slag, resulting in a higher total amount of 
additives, i.e. 25 % limestone, 6 % alumina and 5 % gypsum.  MixC is more or less the same as MixB. The only 
difference is the substitution of 14 % AOD slag by BOF slag. Finally, we looked at MixD, which only consists 
of ladle slag. 
In table 2, the analysed chemical composition of each mixture is presented, along with the calculated potential 
phase composition. Chemical analysis of each slag used is typical as those given by Tossavainen et al17, and 
Yang et al 18. It is important to point out, that, in the chemical analyses (table 2), iron is given as Fetot and sulphur 
as elemental, S0. However, in the mass balance discussed, these elements have been recalculated as Fe2O3 and 
SO3 and, thus, all iron present is assumed to be Fe2O3 and sulphur, as SO3. In addition, since only five linear 
equations have been chosen, the total phase composition of the desired phase assemblage will not be 100 %. The 
other elements are either considered as individual minerals and/or elements which are incorporated in the 
structure of expected minerals such as dicalcium silicate.  It is worthwhile to mention that minor percentages of 
MnO, P2O5, K2O, V2O5, TiO2 and Cr2O3 were detected too. The level of these oxides measured 2.5 wt-% in 
MixA (of which 1.5 wt-% is Cr2O3), 3.3 wt-% in MixB (of which 1 wt-% is Cr2O3 and 1.7 wt-% MnO), 4.3 wt-% 
in MixC (of which 0.7 wt-% is Cr2O3, 0.8 wt-% V2O5 and 2 wt-% MnO) and finally 1.8 wt-% in MixD (of which 
1 wt-% is  TiO2). The rest of the excess in weight (not specified in table 2) refers to oxygen being part of the 
calcium carbonate structure as well as the gypsum and iron compound.

The result of the mass balance indicates that dicalcium silicate is expected to be one of the dominating mineral in 
each mixture.  The main difference is the amount of ferrites and sulphoaluminate. Sulphoaluminate was 
estimated to be 26 wt-% in MixA and 38 wt-% in MixD, while both MixB and MixC give a considerably higher 
amount of ferrites, i.e. 39 wt-% and 48 wt-% respectively. However, since AOD slag is replaced by BOF slag in 
MixC, the total iron content should increase, resulting in a higher amount of ferrite within the composition.  A 
high amount of C4AF is a good thing, since this compound contributes to both the early and late strength in the 
SAB system 9.

2.2 Experimental procedure
2.2.1 Thermal analysis 
The measurements of the thermal analysis coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometer, QMG 420, were carried 
out simultaneously using the Netzsch STA 409 equipment shown in figure 4. 100-mg test materials were 
contained in an alumna crucible and subjected to a programmed heating of 10 K/min in an air atmosphere, in the 
temperature range of 25 to 1400 °C. A TG/DTA (thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses) sample 
holder with an alumina crucible is positioned on a radiation shield in order to protect the balance. The 
investigated samples can be tested in the mode TG/DTA sample + correction, i.e. in order to avoid problems 
with Buyonce effect, an empty crucible is run (correction data) before analysing the sample. The gases formed 
during the reaction were identified using quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) measurements connected with 
STA equipment. In a high-frequency, quadrupole electric field, it is possible to separate ions according to their 
mass/charge ratio (m/e) (see figure 4).

2.2.2 Sample preparation and firing of briquettes 
Each slag was crushed, using a jaw crusher, and divided into representative samples using a rotary splitter and 
ground in a rod mill for approximately 25 minutes. The slags were further combined to produce the mixtures 
given in table 1. In order to get a good homogenisation and a fairly fine powder-like material, the mixtures were 
once again introduced to a rod mill and run for approximately 60 minutes. The ground mixtures were prepared as 
briquettes with the approximate dimension of ØxH, i.e. 2x4 cm before firing in order to get good contact between 
particles, and then dried in an oven for 24h at 100 ºC. The briquettes were fired in a furnace with an air 
atmosphere at 1200 ºC for approximately 30 minutes followed by water cooling.  The cooled briquettes were 
dried in an oven for 24 h at 100 ºC and then examined by XRD and SEM.
2.2.3 Particle size distribution 
Before firing the mixtures, the particle size distribution was determined with a Malvern 2000, and the results are 
given in figure 5a-d.  From those figures, it can be seen that all mixtures except MixB give a similar distribution. 
MixB gives a d50§15ȝm while other mixtures reach approximately d50§20ȝm. It can therefore be stated that all 
the mixtures are powder-like materials and that there is nothing critical about MixB being finer than the others 
and vice verse, according to later results.

2.2.4 XRD and SEM analyses 
A Siemens D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer with CuKĮ radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA was used.  The 
analyses were run with step scan, i.e. 4 seconds per step in the 10-90 2-theta range.  
Observations of sulphoaluminate in the investigated samples were performed with SEM using a Phillips XL 30 
equipped with energy dispersive spectra, EDS in the 20 keV range.  The material was first dispersed (10 - 20 
mg) in a few millilitres of ethanol, and then, while sonicating, a sample of the pulp was taken out with a pipette. 
One drop was placed on a double sided carbon tape. Thereafter, the samples were sputter coated with gold.

3. Results and Discussion  
3.1 Results of Simultaneous Thermal Analysis, STA 
Contemporary thermoanalytic equipment like the Netzsch STA 409, offer very useful measurements in order to 
analyse the behaviour of materials heated in controlled atmospheres. The results of the mixtures are compiled in 
figure 6a-d. The figures basically depict the behaviour of the different mixtures when heated until 1400 ºC in an 
air atmosphere. In the approximate temperature range, 1100-1300 ºC, clinker formation can be noted and the 
area is highlighted with a circle.  However, from the marked areas, it is not by any means a trivial and 
straightforward task to exactly tell which reaction refers to which peak, since many reactions take place 
simultaneously, resulting in overlapping endothermic and exothermic sequences. The TG results provide the 
relative differences in weight loss between tested samples. It can be seen very clearly that the most significant 
weight loss is especially pronounced in MixB and MixC with about 9 wt-%, respectively. According to table 3, 
which summarises differences in weight loss, as well as detected gases of each mixture, the results indicate a 
weight loss of approximately 7 and 5 wt-% more than was observed for MixA and MixD, where a loss of only 4 
and 2.5 wt-% were reached, respectively. In any event, since more calcite exists from the start in MixB and 
MixC, it should consequently result in a higher percentage of loss.  It also implies that much less CO2 is released 
as compared to OPC, where the CO2 emissions generally reach about 40 %. 
On closer examination of the TG/DTG, Differential Thermogravimetry, there are basically three distinct effects 
which can easily be distinguished in sample MixA, MixB, and MixC. The first effect at 100-150ºC refers to 
physical water. The amount of water is practically the same, apart from MixA giving 3.6 loss in wt-% compared   
to the approximately 1.5 wt-% in the other mixtures. This peak is accompanied further on by an even broader 
and more pronounced peak, which is recognised as decomposition of calcium carbonate according to reaction 
(1). Depending on which mixture is being discussed, a maximum is reached at slightly different temperatures. 
However, in general, the calcination starts at 700 ºC and the maximum is reached between 750-800 ºC, 
independent of mixture in question (see table 3). The DTG results show agreement with the corresponding gas 
profiles, i.e. implying the released moisture and carbon dioxide emissions at the aforementioned temperatures. 
The last small effect at rather high temperature, i.e. 1300-1400 ºC is related to the evaporation of sulphur dioxide 
due to the decomposition of gypsum. The SO2 emissions, however, were only registered in the case of MixA and 
14
MixC, and can also be viewed in the results of gases.  Although MixB and MixC are very similar in composition 
and behave very much the same, no sulphur dioxide could be detected from MixB. As an explanation, the 
sulphate present is presumably consumed in relation to the clinker formation, i.e. no saturation of sulphate, 
which is also believed to be the case in MixC, keeping in mind that the level of sulphur dioxide observed in 
MixC only reaches 0.2 in ion current. Furthermore, a weight loss of 0.05 wt-% with regard to MixD is 
considered to be neglected and of no importance, since it is so considerably low.  
After the broad endothermic peak already discussed, a small exothermic reaction was detected in relation to 
MixA and MixD. This peak was found at 1000 ºC in MixD and at 1130 ºC in MixA. Next, this reaction was 
followed by a distinct endothermic effect at 1150 ºC in MixA. The corresponding reaction appears at 1180 ºC in 
MixB, MixC, and MixD. Thereafter, in all the samples, this pattern repeats itself by having shifting effects due to 
small endothermic and exothermic reactions. A more pronounced reaction was recorded at 1300 ºC in the case of 
MixC and MixD, and was not as sharp in the other discussed materials at the same temperature. The various 
reactions taking place is partly related to the formation of sulphoaluminate. From a general point of view, it 
starts at approximately 1000 ºC, according to reaction (2), and depending on which mixture. In the context of 
kinetics, the firing conditions strongly influences the completeness of formation, as well as the amount of 
mineralising elements. In slags, where dicalcium silicate already is present, the polymorphic transformation of    
Ȗ ĺ Į’L usually takes place at 900 ºC and, furthermore, Į’Lĺ Į’H at 1180 ºC 19. These kinds of transition states 
also contribute to the observations made by DTA.

In addition to particle size distribution, some other physical data were analysed before and after firing of the 
briquettes.  The density is of the same magnitude before and after firing. The same result can be applied to all 
other data measured and presented in table 4, i.e. porosity.

More interesting, though, is the change in colour seen in figure 7.  While all mixtures have white and grey 
nuances in colour before being fired, the difference in composition becomes clear afterwards, thus indicating the 
formation of new phases and in different proportions.  While MixA and MixD are somewhat light brown and 
light green, it can be easily noticed that MixB and MixC are rather dark brown. The brown colour is especially 
sharp in the case of MixC. It should be pointed out that the light green colour in MixA and MixD could be due to 
the non-hydraulic phase 2C2S·CaSO4, which is not unreasonable to achieve at the temperature in question, when 
Į’-C2S reacts with CaSO4 20. However, as shall be seen, this phase was not detected by x-ray diffraction, and 
therefore, if present, the amount should be quite low, (approximately < 3 %), otherwise it would have been 
detected.

3.3 X-ray diffraction, XRD 
X-ray diffraction analyses of the samples are summarized in table 5, which gives a good overall picture of what 
has been formed, as well as that which has disappeared from the starting mixtures, while figure 8 provides the 
XRD pattern of MixA before and after firing as an example of all the patterns recorded.  In the raw material of 
MixA, XRD revealed the presence of calcite, merwinite, calcium silicate (non-hydraulic), and akermanite as 
major phases.  After the mixture was fired, none of these phases appeared. Instead, sulphoaluminate, also 
referred as yeeliminite, was detected along with bredigite, which is an alpha’-structure of dicalcium silicate. 
Apparently, calcite has reacted with alumina and sulphate to form the sulphoaluminate phase, as expected. It is 
not clear though, what the role of mayenite has been, regarding the formation of sulphoaluminate in other words, 
to what extent this phase reacted with the calcium sulphate present.   In any event, since no mayenite or other 
alumina phase was detected afterwards except for sulphoaluminate, its contribution to the formation of 
sulphoaluminate can be assumed. The latter is presumably applicable in the case of MixD too. Without any 
additives at all, a single ladle slag fired at 1200 °C forms all the desired clinker minerals, along with some free 
periclase, already present from the start.  Since no alumina and sulphate were added, it is reasonable that 
mayenite, being one of the major minerals in this material, reacts with gypsum to form sulphoaluminate. 
However, in the ladle slag tricalcium aluminate was found (as well in the beginning) and should therefore not be 
overlooked with regard to the sulphoaluminate formation.  Silicates present in MixA and MixD, such as 
akermanite and merwinite, are believed to be part of the formation of bredigite, and calcium silicate in relation to 
the beta structure of dicalcium silicate, as the temperature in question provides the polymorphic transformation 
of this mineral.  
The raw meal of MixB and MixC could be said to be constituted of the same minerals, but in different 
proportions. Apart from additives, the major phases detected were periclase, calcium silicate, mayenite, and 
wuestite.  Still, important differences were detected after firing. The clinker material of MixB seemed more 
promising than MixC, in view of the better intensities of sulphoaluminate and formation of brownmillerite 
(instead of the calcium magnesium alumina iron silicate structure which was obtained in MixC).  All together, 
substituting AOD slag by BOF slag clearly, in this case, influences the final composition. The latter, however, 
does not in general imply that AOD slag is preferable. What could be stated is that AOD slag might be more 
suitable in a starting mixture similar to that of MixB.

3.4 Scanning electron microscopy, SEM
SEM analyses were performed to actually view the presence of sulphoaluminate. Figure 9a-d, show the 
observations made of the sulphoaluminate phase.  Figure 9a represents what was found in MixA, i.e. a hexagonal 
tabular structure 20, and the composition of that structure is confirmed by the energy spectra, EDS.  The same 
kind of structure is viewed in MixB-D, and is confirmed with EDS as in MixA (see figure 9b-d).  The general 
impression was that a larger amount of sulphoaluminate was formed in MixA, as compared to MixB, MixC, and 
MixD where it seemed to be less. However, quantification of clinker phases is beyond the scope of this work, but 
needs to be investigated in future work.

4. Conclusions 
The work covers analyses of four different mixtures containing high amounts of steelmaking slag from the 
steelmaking industry in Sweden. The goal was to produce belite rich cement activated with sulphoaluminate.  
Thermal analyses coupled with a mass spectrometer, XRD and SEM were used for the characterisation of the 
mixtures’ behaviour. The results reveal formation of clinker phases such as sulphoaluminate, SAC 34 , and 
polymorphs of dicalcium silicate, i.e. Į’-C2S and ȕ - C2S. The next step, however, is to investigate the hydraulic 
properties, and further on, it will also be necessary to try to quantify the clinker phases obtained.

Abstract 
Steelmaking slags were combined based on modified Bouge calculations in order to produce a belite-rich clinker 
activated with sulphoaluminate. The experiments were conducted on two different mixtures based on 
steelmaking slags along with additives, i.e. MixA and MixB. The objective of the present work is to investigate 
the hydraulic properties of the specimens, using conduction calorimetry, XRD, and DSC as well as to measure 
the mechanical strength of the specimens when hydrated for 2 and 28 days. The compressive strength was in 
accordance with that suggested in the literature for slow hardening SAB cement. Both mixtures behaved the 
same with regard to heat development as well as the amount of AFt formed during the first 24 hours of the 
hydration. 
Keywords: By-product, Hydration; Sulphoaluminate

21. Introduction 
Each year, large amounts of slag are generated in the steelmaking industry. In parallel, it is important to find 
ways of reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions within the cement industry.  Therefore, as 
investigated in part 1 of this work 1, steelmaking slag was used as raw meal along with other additives for the 
formation of sulphoaluminate belite cement (SAB) which was fired at 1200°C in an air atmosphere. The results 
from that work proved that steelmaking slags have the potential to work as raw materials. This part, however, is 
focused on the hydraulic properties where two of those investigated mixtures, MixA and MixB with regard to the 
formation of SAB clinkers are further examined. 
There are important differences in the hydration reactions between ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and SAB 
clinkers which need to be clarified.  In both types formation of ettringite (AFt) will take place, but it is not 
formed by the same reactants. In relation to the OPC, different periods are usually discussed in the following 
order, the initial period, the dormant period, the acceleration phase, the deceleration phase, and an ever-slowing 
reaction phase 2. In the first period, hydrolysis and release of ions into the solution take place, and the reaction is 
characterised as very rapid and exothermic 3. Within the first couple of minutes, the heat evolved is due to the 
hydration of sulphate, the formation of AFt according to chemical reaction (1), as well as the wetting 4. After the 
dormant period which might last between 30 minutes and 2 hours the next heat liberated is attributed to the 
hydration of tricalcium silicate (C3S). After approximately 12-15 hours of hydration, AFt will react with 
tricalcium aluminate (C3A) to form monosulphate 4 (AFm) according to chemical reaction (2).  In the SAB 
system, however, the AFt is formed when sulphoaluminate as well as the ferrite phases (which follow the same 
sequence as C3A) react with the present calcium sulphate and water. Reaction (3) 5 gives the overall hydration 
mechanism for sulphoaluminate, and in the case of expansion ettringite is produced according to reaction (4) 5. It 
can therefore be concluded that AFt is not a final product of the OPC system, while the SAB paste generally is 
constituted by AFt, AFm, alumina, and ferrite gel 6.

32. Material and experimental procedure
2.1.  Material
Slags were combined according to table 1 (i.e. estimated by using modified Bouge calculations). In MixA there 
is mainly AOD (argon oxygen decarburization) slag (i.e. 55 wt-% but also 15 wt-% of ladle slag blended with 
gypsum, alumina, and calcium carbonate, 10 wt-% of each additive). In addition to AOD slag, which only made 
up 14 wt-% of MixB, and ladle slag, which made up 25 wt-%, MixB also contains 25 wt-% EAF (electric arc 
furnace) slag, along with 25 wt-% limestone and minor percentages of alumina and sulphate, (5 and 6 wt-% 
respectively). In table 2, the chemical composition is presented, as well as the potential phase composition. The 
phase composition is calculated based on the results presented in part 1 of this work 1.
The ferrite phase is calculated to be 39 wt-% in MixB but only 12 wt-% in MixA which creates the greatest 
difference between the mixtures in view of the final composition. Dicalcium silicate is expected to be higher in 
MixA, with a value of 58 wt-% compared to 36 wt-% in MixB. The same kind of difference is seen for 
sulphoaluminate, i.e. 26 wt-% in MixA and 12 wt-% in MixB.

2.2. Experimental procedure 
Each slag was crushed, using a jaw crusher, divided into representative samples using a rotary splitter and 
ground in a rod mill for approximately 25 minutes. The slags were further combined to produce MixA and MixB 
as given in table 1. In order to achieve good homogenisation and a fairly fine powder-like material, the mixtures 
were once again introduced to a rod mill and ground for approximately 60 minutes. The ground mixtures were 
prepared as briquettes with the approximate dimension of ØxH, i.e. 2x4 cm before firing in order to get good 
contact between particles and then dried in an oven for 24h at 100 ºC. The briquettes were fired in a furnace in 
an air atmosphere at 1200 ºC for approximately 30 minutes. This was followed by water cooling.  The cooled 
briquettes were dried in an oven for 24 h at 100 ºC. Thereafter, the briquettes were ground with a rod mill for   
25 minutes followed by a vibration mill for 25 minutes. Next, the material was run through a magnetic 
separation and then divided into three representative samples using a Jones riffle. In one of the dividers, 5 % 
gypsum was added, and in a second one, 10 % gypsum was added, while the third sample was left untreated with 
regard to the addition of gypsum. The three dividers were then once again ground separately with a vibration 
mill in order to get a close particle size distribution and good homogenisation of those to which additions of 
gypsum were made. Finally, material from all three of the samples was taken out using a Jones Riffle for further 
determination of the particle size distribution of each sample.
52.2.1. Particle size distribution 
The fineness of the samples prepared was determined by a Malvern 2000, which is an optical sizing unit, and the 
measurement was performed by Cementa Research AB, Sweden. 
2.2.2. Compressive Strength  
Mortar prisms with the dimension of 25x25x285 mm were prepared and tested by Cementa Research AB, 
Sweden. The material was blended with sand and water in the ratio 3:1:0.5 and hydrated for 2 and 28 days. In the 
first 24 hours, the mortars cured in a moisture chamber with 95 % relative humidity at 20 °C. Thereafter, the 
moulds were cured in water at 20 °C until the mechanical strength was tested.  
2.2.3. Calorimetry 
Isothermal calorimetry was performed on a TAM air (Thermal Activity Monitor) instrument from Thermometric 
using glass ampoules.  The instrument is an 8-channel heat flow calorimeter for heat flow measurements in the 
milliwatt range and the measurement was performed on mixtures and an OPC. Duplicate samples were 
performed using, 100 ml/sample with a w/c-ratio =0.5 for 24 hours at 20 ºC. The tests were performed by 
Cementa Research AB, Sweden.
2.2.4. X-ray diffraction, XRD 
Confirmation of AFt was carried out on a Phillips X'pert Pro diffractometer with CuKĮ radiation and an 
“X’celerator” detector. The scanning was carried out after 24 hours between 7-50 degrees in the 2-theta range 
and performed by Cementa Research AB, Sweden. 
62.2.5. Differential scanning calorimetry, DSC 
The DSC experiment was run on a DSC 7 Perkins Elmer Differential Scanning Calorimeter to analyse the 
formation of AFt. This was performed by mixing a sample with water, but in order to stop the hydration, acetone 
was added. Thereafter, the sample was filtered and the moisture mass which was left was ground and heated with 
the DSC instrument (20°C/min) as well as analyzed by XRD in order to confirm the presence of AFt. The tests 
were performed by Cementa Research AB, Sweden. 
2.2.6. Scanning electron microscopy, SEM 
The SEM analyses were performed in the 20 keV range with a Phillips XL 30 equipped with energy dispersive 
spectra (EDS) which enables chemical mapping.  The material was first dispersed (10 - 20 mg) in a few 
millilitres of ethanol, and then, while sonicating, a sample of the pulp was taken out with a pipette. One drop was 
placed on a double sided carbon tape. Thereafter, the samples were sputter coated with gold.

From figure 1, it can be seen that all samples of MixB are clearly finer and possess a much better consistency in 
among individuals of the same mixture compared to those of MixA. All MixB-samples have                            
a m50d80 μ≅ , while MixA 0% and MixA 10%, approximately reach a d80 ≅ 80 ȝm, and MixA 5% a       
d80 ≅ 70 ȝm, i.e. somewhat finer. The difference is partly assumed to be due to the presence of metal drops, but it 
could also be explained in terms of grindability. The magnetic separation of by-products belonging to a non-
stainless process is much easier than that originating from the stainless steelmaking process. In MixA there is a 
substantial amount of AOD slag, i.e. 55 %. All MixB blends give an acceptable particle size distribution, and 
instead of differing among individual samples, the blends are closely distributed. It is well known that the 
particle size is an extremely important parameter since it has a considerable affect on the hydration mechanism 
and thereby the final strength of the cement/concrete.

83.2. Compressive strength 
The results for the compressive strength are listed in table 3. The value given for each mixture represents the 
mean value of four tests.

Compressive strength developed for each mixture of MixA and MixB after 2 and 28 days of 
hydration.

MixB   5% Gypsum 7.5 13.5 
MixB 10% Gypsum 7.6 12.3 
Apparently, all MixA samples possess hydraulic properties that are lower than those of MixB. The compressive 
strength of MixB is almost twice as high after two days of hydration. At the level of 28 days of hydration,    
MixA 5% increased by 4.3 MPa, yielding 8.5 MPa, which is significantly lower than MixB 5%, the strength of 
which was determined to be 13.5 MPa. If no addition of gypsum was added, the mortar of MixB 0% measured 
3.7 MPa after 2 days, but that is markedly higher than MixA 0%, which did not provide any strength at all. 
However, even when gypsum was added, it did not bring a result as satisfactory as that of MixB, independent of 
the amount of gypsum added. In MixB, the composition is estimated to have approximately 40 wt-% of calcium 
ferrite, but only about 10 wt-% is contained in MixA. The result of this is a remarkable difference in compressive 
strength. In this case, the ferrite phase provides both the early strength and the final strength of the SAB cement. 
It has been stated that calcium ferrite phases possess higher reactivity in SAB compositions compared to OPC 7.
The results show that mortars of MixB measured strengths in accordance with what is suggested in the literature 
for a slow hardening composition based on the SASC −−−   system 7.  The results obtained also imply that there 
9is a saturation point at about 5 % with regard to the addition of gypsum. Going from 0 % to 5 %, there is a 
considerable increase in strength. If 10 % of gypsum is added instead, the compressive strength remains almost 
the same as if 5 % is added, regardless of the mixture composition.   
3.3. Conduction calorimetry 
The conduction calorimetry was performed on MixA 5% and MixB 5%, chosen based on the compressive 
strength results and on a commercial OPC. The heat generated from these samples as function of time is shown 
in figure 2. MixA 5% and MixB 5% give roughly the same pattern, although MixA 5% seems to react slightly 
faster for the first seven hours but does not release as much heat as MixB 5%. Still, both mixtures reach their 
maximum within 10 hours after which both of them also start to level off. The OPC sample reacts much more 
than MixA 5% and MixB 5% and reaches its maximum after approximately 10 hours until it levels off. 
However, the heat liberation for OPC does not level off as quickly as in MixA 5% and MixB 5%.

 The AFt is formed according to reactions (3) and (4), i.e. water and calcium sulphate react with sulphoaluminate 
instead of tricalcium aluminate. In this investigation, it is believed to be mainly reaction (3) that takes place in 
these mixtures, since no calcium hydroxide is expected before mixing with water, but polymorphs of C2S will

contribute to reaction (4) by Ca2+ ions when C2S dissolves, and thus react with OH - ions to form Ca(OH)2.
Furthermore, there will also be a contribution to AFt formation from the ferrite phases which follow the 
aluminates in OPC, though this reaction is reported to be much slower in rate. Considering the modified Bouge 
calculations, it can be assumed that the influence of heat developed due to hydration of ferrites is more 
pronounced in MixB than in MixA. As shown in figure 2, the first few minutes of heat liberation is the same for 
all samples. The initial period is characterised by wetting, producing very rapid exothermic reactions, as 
expected. The dormant period seems to last longer for MixB, but both MixA 5% and MixB 5% show a very 
strong and intense increase in reaction activity when the dormant period ends while the acceleration period lasts 
at least 1.5 hours for both MixA and MixB. After approximately 10 hours, both MixA and MixB start to level off 
dramatically and the heat liberation becomes very weak further on. Significant heat which is evolved in early 
hours is related to the formation of AFt, and it is well known that a substantial amount of sulphoaluminate 
present in any SAB composition is consumed in parallel to the AFt formation i.e. 60-70 % of the 
sulphoaluminate is usually consumed within the first 24 hours 7. The formation of AFt is not the only reaction 
which takes place, but it is surely the dominating reaction, as is supposed at early stages when SAB 
compositions hydrate.

3.4. Measurement of AFt  
The formation of AFt was confirmed by the x-ray patterns given in figure 3.  MixA 5% and MixB 5% have a 
similar diffractogram and both give a much higher intensity of AFt than OPC. Furthermore, as expected, 
Ca(OH)2 can be observed for OPC, indicating the silicates being dissolved when mixed with water.

The amount of AFt formation was analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The first peak, in   
figure 4 of each sample belongs to acetone, and the heat accompanied with the AFt present was distinguished at 
approximately 150 °C. Since the amount could not be quantified, it is only the relative amount between the 
mixtures that can be evaluated. From figure 4, it can be noted that the amount of AFt is rather equal for       
MixA 5% and MixB 5% during the first 24 hours.  
All together, it can be concluded that the formation of AFt after a few hours is more accelerated in MixA 5% and 
MixB 5% in comparison to the formation of AFt in OPC. The amount of tricalcium silicate in OPC tested is 
approximately 54 %, which is much more than the expected amount of sulphoaluminate in MixA and MixB. As 
a result, the OPC obtained the more lasting heat development, to which the ferrites and dicalcium silicate 
reactions also contribute.

4. Conclusions 
The results of the hydraulic properties of two SAB clinkers based on a large amount of steelmaking slags are 
covered in the present work. The results revealed a better usefulness for MixB mortars with regard to the 
compressive strength until 28 days of the hydration. After 2 and 28 days, the strength agrees to that suggested in 
the literature for a slow hardening SAB composition.  The reason why MixA measured lower values in strength 
is believed to be a lack of ferrites in comparison to MixB.  Nonetheless, whether the strength of MixA mortars is 
low or high enough depends on what application it is considered for. In future work it will be important to 
investigate the leaching behaviour of the materials as well as the quantity of each clinker phase present. If the 
slags are going to be used as raw meal in a production line, it is important to be able to control the production in 
terms of getting an even final product/composition, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.
