ABSTRACT
Divalent metal ions promote hydrolysis of RNA back-
bones generating 50OH and 20;30P as cleavage pro-
ducts. In these reactions, the neighboring 20OH act
as the nucleophile. RNA catalyzed reactions also
require divalent metal ions and a number of different
metal ions function in RNA mediated cleavage of RNA.
In one case, the LZV leadzyme, it was shown that this
catalytic RNA requires lead for catalysis. So far, none
of the naturally isolated ribozymes have been demon-
strated to use lead to activate the nucleophile. Here we
provide evidence that RNase P RNA, a naturally trans-
acting ribozyme, has leadzyme properties. But, in
contrast to LZV RNA, RNase P RNA mediated cleavage
promoted by Pb21 results in 50 phosphate and 30OH as
cleavage products. Based on our findings, we infer
that Pb21 activates H2O to act as the nucleophile
and we identified residues both in the substrate and
RNase P RNA that most likely influenced the position-
ing of Pb21 at the cleavage site. Our data suggest that
Pb21 can promote cleavage of RNA by activating
either an inner sphere H2O or a neighboring 2
0OH to
act as nucleophile.
INTRODUCTION
The interaction of divalent metal ions e.g. Mg2+ with the
negatively charged backbone of RNA promotes proper folding
and therefore plays an important role for RNA function/activ-
ity. Ribozymes or catalytic RNAs catalyze a large number of
reactions including cleavage of other RNA molecules. In addi-
tion to promoting correct folding and facilitating the interac-
tion with the RNA substrate, divalent metal ions are directly
involved in the chemistry of RNA mediated cleavage of RNA.
But note that certain RNAs e.g. the hammerhead and the
hairpin ribozymes function in the absence of divalent metal
ions (1).
Binding of metal ions often results in hydrolysis of the RNA
backbone, e.g. lead(II)-induced cleavage of RNA (2,3). Cleav-
age products in metal(II) ion-induced hydrolysis of RNA have
50OH and 20;30 cyclic phosphate at their ends (Figure 1D). This
is also the case when RNA is cleaved by small ribozymes e.g.
the hammerhead RNA. For both hammerhead and metal(II)
ion-induced cleavage it has been suggested that the 20OH at the
site of cleavage is the active nucleophile (2,4). For the natur-
ally occurring trans-acting ribozyme RNase P RNA, and for
other large ribozymes (originating from Group I and Group II
introns) that generate 50P and 30OH as cleavage products, we
have argued that the strategy must be to prevent the 20OH at
the cleavage site from acting as a nucleophile and instead
facilitate nucleophilic attack from the other side of the phos-
phorous center to ensure correct cleavage products (5). Thus,
positioning of metal ions in relation to the cleavage site is of
fundamental importance to ensure correct cleavage and to
suppress unwanted hydrolysis of the RNA.
RNase P RNA is the catalytic subunit of the endoribonuc-
lease RNase P that is responsible for generating the mature
50 termini of tRNA (6,7). Cleavage requires the presence of
divalent metal ions, with Mg2+ as the preferred divalent metal
ion. However, the presence of other divalent metal ions such as
Mn2+ and Ca2+ can also promote cleavage [(5,8) and refer-
ences therein, see also below]. Also, combinations of divalent
metal ions that do not promote cleavage (or do so poorly) when
present alone resulted in increased cleavage activity when
present in combination, e.g. mixing Sr2+ with Mn2+ or Zn2+
(9,10). This suggests that there is metal ion cooperativity in
RNase P RNA mediated cleavage (9). One of the metal ions
involved in this cooperativity was suggested to be positioned
in the vicinity of the interaction between the 30 end of the
substrate and RNase P RNA, the RCCA–RNase P RNA inter-
action [(5,9,11); interacting residues underlined]. According to
our model, the other metal ion(s) would be positioned at or in
the vicinity of the cleavage site and be involved in generating
the nucleophile (Figure 1C). Recently, we presented functional

and structural evidence that substitution of the base pair at the
cleavage site (the +1/+72 bp) influenced Mg2+ binding in its
vicinity (12). This finding is in keeping with previous data
suggesting that a metal ion is bound in the vicinity of the
cleavage site. Earlier data also suggest that a metal ion
coordinated H2O acts as the nucleophile (5,13–24). In the
present investigation, we were initially interested to study
the structural requirements for metal ion binding at the
RNase P cleavage site. Therefore, we studied Pb2+-induced
cleavage of model RNA hairpin RNase P substrates carrying

changes at the cleavage site. Moreover, based on our previous
data demonstrating that Pb2+ promotes hydrolysis of model
RNA hairpin substrates near the RNase P cleavage site in the
absence of RNase P RNA (21) and that combinations of meta-
l(II) ions that do not promote cleavage (or do so poorly) when
present alone can result in increased cleavage activity, we
were also interested to investigate whether Pb2+ in combina-
tion with other divalent metal ions can promote RNase P RNA
mediated cleavage.
Here we present data suggesting that the presence of a
purine at the +1 position in the substrate suppresses Pb2+-
induced cleavage at this position. However, a guanosine at +1
resulted in M1 RNA (RNase P RNA derived from Escherichia
coli) mediated cleavage at the correct position in the presence
of Pb2+ and Sr2+ or Co(NH3)6
3+ as the only divalent metal ions.
Thus, RNase P RNA has leadzyme properties. The observation
that Sr2+ or Co(NH3)6
3+ did not promote cleavage alone is in
keeping with a model that Pb2+ is responsible for activating the
nucleophile and we identified residues in both RNase P RNA
and in the substrate that influence cleavage in the presence of
Pb2+. Our findings provide experimental evidence for the
model suggesting that the establishment of the RCCA–
RNase P RNA interaction results in a re-coordination of
Mg2+ positioned in the vicinity of the cleavage site (25).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of substrates and RNase P RNA
The various pATSer derivatives were purchased from
Dharmacon, USA, purified, labeled at the 50 end and gel puri-
fied according to standard procedures as described elsewhere
(11,26,27). The RNase P RNA variants were generated as run-
off transcripts using T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(27,28).
Assay conditions and determination of the kinetic
constants under single turnover conditions
The assays were performed under single turnover conditions
at pH 6.1 or 7.2 (as indicated) in Buffer B: 50 mM Bis-Tris
Propane, 5% (w/v) PEG 6000, 100 mM NH4Cl and MgCl2/
SrCl2/Co(NH3)6
3+/PbOAc at different concentrations as indic-
ated. All reactions were performed at 37C. Reaction products
were separated on denaturing 20–22% (w/v) polyacrylamide
gels and quantified using Phosphorimager (Molecular
Dynamics 400S) as described elsewhere (5). The final con-
centrations of RNase P RNA and substrate were <20 mM and
3.2 mM, respectively.
The kinetic constants kobs and kobs/K
sto (¼ kcat/Km) were
determined under saturating single turnover conditions at pH
6.1 in Buffer B as described previously (5,12) at:
[Mg2+] ¼ 40 mM; [Sr2+] ¼ 40 mM and [Mg2+] ¼ 8 mM;
[Sr2+] ¼ 40 mM and [Pb2+] ¼ 8 mM; [Sr2+] ¼ 160 mM
and [Pb2+] ¼ 8 mM. The final concentration of substrate
was <20 nM whereas the concentration of RNase P RNA
was varied between 0.025 and 6.4 mM dependent on substrate
and RNase P RNA variant. For the calculations we used the 50
cleavage fragments and the time of cleavage was adjusted to
ensure that we were in the linear part of the curve of kinetics.
The kinetic constants were obtained by linear regression from
Eadie–Hofstee plots.
Binding assay conditions
Spin columns were used to determine the apparent equilibrium
dissociation constant (appKd) as described elsewhere (5,12)
in Buffer C: 50 mM MES at pH 6.0, 0.8 M NH4OAc,
0.05 %(w/v) Nonidet P40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS and different con-
centration of CaCl2 or SrCl2 as indicated. The final concen-
tration of substrate was <20 nM and [RNase P RNA] was
varied between 0.025 to 6.4 mM (concentration range
depended on RNase P RNA variant). The appKd was determ-
ined by using OriginPro 7.0 software and the equation
fc ¼ ft · [RNase P RNA]free/(Kd + [RNase P RNA]free),
where fc represent fraction of substrate in complex with
RNase P RNA and ft ¼ maximum fraction of substrate able
to bind RNase P RNA, i.e. end point.
Lead(II)-induced cleavage conditions
The different 50 end labeled pATSer derivatives were subjec-
ted to Pb2+-induced cleavage in Buffer A: 50 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.2, 5% (w/v) PEG 6000, 100 mM NH4Cl, 40 mM MgCl2
(or SrCl2) and PbOAc at a final concentration of 4 mM. The
substrates were preincubated in Buffer A in the absence of
PbOAc for 10 min at 37C, incubated for 5 min after addition
of PbOAc and the cleavage products were analyzed by gel-
electrophoresis as described elsewhere (21,27).
Determination of the site of cleavage
Cleavage at +1 was inferred by comparing the mobility of the
50 cleavage fragments generated in the presence of Pb2+/Sr2+
and Mg2+ (see above). To verify the presence of 50 phosphate
at the 50 termini of the cleaved product (internally labeled with
[a-32P]GTP), the large cleavage product was gel purified and
subjected to digestion with RNase T1, RNase T2 and pancre-
atic RNase A as described previously (29). Thin-layer chro-
matography according to Nishimura (30) was used to detect
the 50 phosphate-labeled nucleotide i.e. pGp.
RESULTS
A purine at +1 suppresses metal induced cleavage at
this position
The pATSerCG substrate is a well-characterized RNase P
substrate that is cleaved at several positions in the 50 leader
in the presence of Pb2+ and absence of RNase P RNA (21). A
similar type of substrate was also used elsewhere and it was
demonstrated that Mg2+ induced cleavage in the 50 leader the
vicinity of the RNase P cleavage site (15). Hence, to invest-
igate the structural requirements for positioning of a metal(II)
ion at the RNase P cleavage site, we introduced changes at
positions1, +1 and/or +72 in pATSer (Figure 1A; the residue
that pairs with residue +1 corresponds to residue +72 in tRNA
and will therefore be referred to residue +72). These pATSer
variants were subjected to Pb2+-induced cleavage. As shown in
Figure 2, introduction of a U or C at +1 resulted in significant
cleavage at +1 irrespective of identity of the residue at +72 or
1. By contrast, a significant reduction in Pb2+-induced cleav-
age at +1 was observed due to the presence of purine deriv-
atives at this position. Moreover, our data suggested that base
pairing between U+1 and the base at +72 did not influence
Pb2+-induced cleavage at +1 (Figure 2, compare cleavage of

U+1/A+72, U+1/DAP+72, U+1/C+72 and 3mU+1/A+72 variants).
Neither did substitution of N7 of G+1 with c7 as was evident
when Pb2+ cleavage of pATSerUGG/C, pATSerUGdG/C and
pATSerUG(c7dG)/C was compared (data not shown; under-
lined residues corresponds to residues G+1 and C+72) or in the
absence of the 30 terminal sequence G+73CCAC (Figure 1A). A
significant Mg2+-induced cleavage at +1 was also observed
due to replacement of G+1/C+72 with U+1/A+72 (data not
shown). Surprisingly, introduction of ribavirin at +1 resulted
in a similar suppression of Pb2+-induced cleavage at +1 com-
pared to when the substrate carried a purine at this position.
The 50 cleavage products generated as a result of addition of
Pb2+ migrated slightly slower compared to the migration of the
50 cleavage fragments produced in the M1 RNA mediated
cleavage reaction (see below Figure 3A and data not
shown). In addition, the Pb2+ induced 50 cleavage products
could not be labeled at their 30 ends with [32P]pCp (data not
shown). These findings are expected given that metal(II)-
induced cleavage generates cleavage product ends with
50OH and 20;30 cyclic phosphates (2,3). Analysis of the
50 end of the larger cleavage product by thin-layer chromato-
graphy (i.e. the presence of nucleotides with a 50 phophate
could not be detected; Figure 3B upper panel) is in agreement
with these findings.
We conclude that the local structural architecture around the
+1 residue influence the positioning of Pb2+ (or Mg2+) in its
vicinity. More specifically we suggest that the presence of a
purine at +1 prevents substantial metal induced cleavage at +1
and that the Hoogsteen surface of purine plays an important
role. The observed cleavage at +1 for the U+1 and C+1 deriv-
atives could be due to the electronegative environment gen-
erated by the oxygen at position 2 of U or C in the shallow
groove (see also below). In all other cases tested there is either
an exocyclic amine or no chemical group in the shallow
groove at this position in the substrate.
RNase P RNA has leadzyme properties
The presence of Pb2+ induces hydrolysis of the phosphate
backbone at the RNase P cleavage site (and in its vicinity)
in the precursor substrate while combinations of metal ions
that do not promote cleavage by themselves (or do so poorly)
results in increased RNase P RNA mediated cleavage (9). Pb2+
was not included in our previous studies since we argued that
addition of Pb2+ results in cleavage of RNase P RNA as well as
other RNAs in particular at pH > 7 (2,3,9). Nonetheless,
we decided to investigate whether RNase P RNA can mediate
cleavage at the correct position in the presence of Pb2+.

cleavage at 1, +1 and +2 were calculated and the relative distribution in percent was plotted as indicated. Dgccac indicate residues that were deleted in these
pATSerUG derivatives as illustrated in Figure 1.

Conceivably this would give us a tool to identify factors
important for generating 50P and 30OH as cleavage products
on the one hand, and 50OH and 20;30 cyclic phosphate on the
other, where the former cleavage products are hallmarks for
RNase P RNA promoted cleavage and the latter the signature
for Me2+- (here Pb2+-) induced cleavage [Figure 1D; (2, 6)].
Addition of Pb2+ will result in cleavage of both M1 RNA and
the substrate pATSer at specific as well as unspecific positions
Figure 3. (A) M1 RNA mediated cleavage of pATSerUGG/C, pATSerUGIno/C and pATSerUG2AP/U under single turnover conditions at pH 7.2 in the presence of
8 mM Pb2+ and 40 mM Sr2+ as indicated. Two different M1 RNA variants (3.2 mM final concentration; final concentration of substrate 0.04 mM), wild-type M1
RNA (the number 3 lanes) and M1C294 RNA (the number 4 lanes) were used. Two controls, cleavage of the substrates in the absence of M1 RNA and ± tRNA were
included (no tRNA added the number 1 lanes while in the number 2 lanes tRNA was added). The filled circles indicate M1 RNA mediated cleavage at 1. The
cleavage reaction was terminated after 5 min (for details see text). The different fragments as a result of cleavage at2,1 and +1 are shown. (B) Two-dimensional

Pb2+. Internally labeled [a-32P]GTP pATSerUGG/C was incubated in the presence of Pb2+/Sr2+ and in the absence and in the presence of M1 RNA as indicated. The
large cleavage product was isolated and subjected to RNase digestion as outlined in Materials and Methods. For further experimental details see text. (C) and (D) M1
RNA mediated cleavage expressed as rate of cleavage in % per min as a function of increasing concentration of Sr2+ (C) and Pb2+ (D) using wild-type M1 RNA and

2+ was increased the Pb2+ concentration was kept constant at 8 mM likewise when we varied the Pb2+ concentration the Sr2+
concentration was kept constant at 40 mM. The experiments were performed at pH 6.1 at 37C and the concentrations of M1 RNA and substrate were 3.2 mM and
<40 nM, respectively. (E) M1 RNA mediated cleavage expressed as relative cleavage at +1 in % as a function of increasing concentration of Co(NH3)63+ as indicated
using wild-type M1 RNA. The Pb2+ concentration was 8 mM. The experiment was performed in Buffer B at pH 7.2 at 37C and the concentrations of M1 RNA and
substrate were 3.2 mM and <40 nM, respectively.

(3,7). Thus, cleavage conditions had to be short to minimize
RNA degradation by Pb2+ but long enough to be able to detect
RNase P RNA mediated cleavage. To achieve this objective
we used E.coli RNase P RNA, M1 RNA and pATSerUGG/C
as substrate. The pATSerUGG/C substrate (referred to as ‘wild
type’) has in our previous studies been demonstrated to be as
efficiently cleaved as precursor tRNAs (5,11,12). We prein-
cubated M1 RNA for 10 min at 37C in the presence of various
concentrations of Sr2+ to allow M1 RNA to fold into an active
conformation. No difference in the conformation of M1 RNA
due to replacement of Mg2+ with Sr2+ was observed using
Pb2+-induced cleavage to monitor conformational changes
(21). Note also that Sr2+ alone does not promote M1 RNA
mediated cleavage under these conditions [(9); data not
shown]. The substrate was added (amount added to ensure
single turnover conditions) and after an additional incubation
for 5 min Pb2+ was added to a final concentration of 8 mM
(or as indicated). The cleavage reaction was terminated after
5 min and the cleavage products were separated by gel-
electrophoresis (see Materials and Methods). Surprisingly,
we observed M1 RNA mediated cleavage at the correct posi-
tion +1 under these conditions with an optimum cleavage rate
at 8 mM Pb2+ and 40 mM Sr2+ (Figure 3A). That cleavage was
indeed mediated by M1 RNA was confirmed by employing
thin-layer chromatography to demonstrate the presence of pGp
at the 50 end of the cleavage product (Figure 3B). We also tried
the combination Pb2+ and Co(NH3)6
3+. Here we had to reduce
the concentration of Co(NH3)6
3+ significantly to detect M1
RNA mediated cleavage since higher concentrations of
Co(NH3)6
3+ resulted in inhibition (Figure 3E). The lower con-
centration of Co(NH3)6
3+ is rationalized by that Co(NH3)6
3+
binds to RNA with higher affinity compared to e.g. Sr2+
(21). Consequently, at higher concentration of Co(NH3)6
3+,
Co(NH3)6
3+ most likely displace Pb2+ and thereby cleavage
is inhibited (see also below). Taken together, these findings
are in keeping with our study where we observed cleavage
when we mixed Sr2+ or Co(NH3)6
3+ with Zn2+ (9). In this
context we note that Taira and coworkers (4) have studied
the hammerhead cleavage reaction in the presence of different
metal ions. Their data suggest that La3+ can act both as an
activator and inhibitor of cleavage [see also the work by
Komiyama et al. (31)].
A possibility is that the observed activities are due to con-
tamination of Mg2+ or Ca2+. However, in the presence of
40 mM Sr2+ and 0.1 mM Mg2+ we did not observe M1
RNA mediated cleavage (data not shown). Also, cleavage
in the presence of 15 mM Ca2+ and 25 mM Sr2+ reduce the
efficiency of cleavage >100-fold compared to cleavage in the
presence of 15 mM Mg2+ and 25 mM Sr2+ (9). Hence, since
addition of 0.1 mM Mg2+ did not result in cleavage we do not
expect that addition of Ca2+ would. These data argue against
contamination of Mg2+ and Ca2+.
Replacing pATSerUGG/C with a conventional tRNA pre-
cursor, pSu3, also resulted in cleavage at the correct position at
+1 in the presence of Pb2+ and Sr2+ (data not shown). Finally,
Pb2+ induced cleavage of 32P-labeled M1 RNA showed very
little degradation of M1 RNA after 5 min in the presence of
Pb2+ (data not shown).
We conclude that M1 RNA mediated cleavage can be pro-
moted in the presence of Pb2+ and Sr2+ (or Co(NH3)6
3+), where
Sr2+ and Co(NH3)6
3+ do not promote cleavage when present
alone. Thus, M1 RNA has leadzyme properties. This finding is
in keeping with a model that Pb2+ is involved in generating the
nucleophile i.e. corresponding to MeA in Figure 1C. Given
this, the MeB binding site in the M1 RNA substrate (RS-)
complex would most likely be occupied by Sr2+ (or
Co(NH3)6
3+) since a Pb2+ at this position would result in hydro-
lysis of the M1 RNA phosphate backbone in its vicinity [for
further discussion see Ref (9)].
The leadzyme-like activity is not a unique
feature of M1 RNA
To investigate whether leadzyme-like activity could be
observed for other RNase P RNAs we replaced M1 RNA
with RNase P RNA derived from Mycoplasma hyopneumo-
niae, Hyo P RNA (32) and Yersinia pestis, Yer P RNA
(Figure 4; B. M. F. Pettersson and L. A. Kirsebom, unpub-
lished data). The former is a type B RNase P RNA and the
latter is closely related to M1 RNA i.e. type A. While Hyo P
RNA did not mediate cleavage under these conditions, partly
due to poor substrate binding (data not shown), Yer P RNA

were introduced are highlighted in red.

promoted cleavage of pATSerUGG/C at the correct position
+1 in the presence of Pb2+/Sr2+ although less efficiently com-
pared to M1 RNA (Figure 5). Both Hyo P RNA and Yer P
RNA cleaved pATSerUGG/C efficiently and correctly in the
Mg2+ alone cleavage reaction i.e. 40 mM Mg2+ (Figure 5; data
not shown for Hyo P RNA). Moreover, the appKd value for
Yer P RNA indicated no apparent difference in substrate bind-
ing compared to M1 RNA (see below; Table 1). Thus, the
leadzyme-like activity is not a unique feature of M1 RNA.
Determinations of the apparent binding
constant, appKd and the rate constant kobs
Next we determined the apparent binding constant, appKd, at
two different Sr2+ concentrations 40 and 160 mM at pH 6.0.
This was followed by determinations of the rate constant kobs
under single saturating conditions at pH 6.1. At this pH the rate
of cleavage is linearly dependent on [OH] in the presence of
8 mM Pb2+ and 40 (or 160 mM) mM Sr2+ suggesting that
chemistry is rate-limiting at this pH [data not shown; (5)]. The
linear dependence on [OH] is also consistent with that a
hydroxyl ion is acting as the nucleophile [e.g. see Ref (17)].
To be able to evaluate Pb2+ as a promoter of RNase P RNA
mediated cleavage we also determined kobs in the presence of
8 mM Mg2+ and 40 mM Sr2+ at pH 6.1. The results are shown
in Table 1.
Comparing appKd for wild-type M1 RNA determined in the
presence of Ca2+ or Sr2+ indicated that pATSerUGG/C binds
with 10- and2.5-fold reduced affinity at 40 or 160 mM Me2+,
respectively, in the presence of Sr2+. The rate of cleavage at
position +1 in the presence of Pb2+ was only reduced 6-fold
compared to cleavage in the presence of Mg2+ under the same
conditions indicating that Pb2+ promoted cleavage with reas-
onable rates. Moreover, increasing the Sr2+ concentration res-
ulted in better binding (20-fold) of the substrate but an almost
10-fold reduction in the rate of cleavage. Based on the model
that Pb2+ generates the nucleophile this suggested that Sr2+
presumably had replaced Pb2+ in the vicinity of the cleavage
site i.e. MeA (Figure 1).
Structural architecture of the cleavage site affects
positioning of Pb2+
The observation that Pb2+ is positioned close to the cleavage
site and likely involved in generating the nucleophile gives us
a handle to identify residues and chemical groups in M1 RNA
as well as in the substrate influencing RNase P RNA mediated
cleavage promoted by Pb2+ (and most likely Mg2+). To address
which chemical groups at the cleavage site are important for
efficient cleavage in the presence of Pb2+, we cleaved pATSer
variants with inosine (and C+72) and 2-aminopurine (and U+72)
at +1, respectively (Figure 1A). Here we observed that cleav-
age of the ‘inosine’ variant was significantly reduced while the
level of cleavage of the latter was not significantly different
compared to cleavage of the ‘wild-type’ substrate, pATSer-
UGG/C (Figure 3A). This suggested that the exocyclic amine
at position 2 in guanosine plays an important role possibly
influencing positioning of Pb2+. The importance of the exo-
cylic amine at this position is consistent with previous findings
[Kikovska et al. unpublished data; (33–35)]. Note also that we
observed M1 RNA mediated cleavage at1 in particular using
M1C294 RNA (see below). We also tried to cleave the substrate
where G+1/C+72 had been replaced with U+1/A+72 in the pres-
ence of Pb2+/Sr2+ but no cleavage was observed under these
conditions most likely due to this substrate being a poor sub-
strate for M1 RNA mainly due to its influence on metal ion
binding in its vicinity [data not shown; (12)]. These data sug-
gest that the structural environment at the cleavage site and in
particular the exocyclic amine positioned in the shallow
groove influenced Pb2+/Sr2+ promoted cleavage. We argue
that these results are due to a change in the positioning of
the Pb2+ involved in activating the nucleophile.
Structural architecture of ‘the +73/294 interaction’
affects positioning of Pb2+
We recently provided experimental evidence that there is cross
talk between ‘the +73/294 interaction’ and the cleavage site.
During this process metal ions are suggested to play important
roles [see Figure 1B; (5)]. Hence, we asked whether a change
in the structural architecture of the +73/294 interaction influ-
ences the rate of cleavage in the Pb2+-promoted reaction.
Based on our model that Pb2+ is located close to the cleavage
site (see above) we reasoned that this would give information
about whether the positioning of this Pb2+ ion(s) is affected or
not. Thus, we used a mutant M1 RNA where U294 had been
replaced with a C, M1C294 RNA, resulting in a G+73/C294
interaction instead of a G+73/U294 in the RS-complex

(Figure 1B). The ground state binding (appKd at 40 mM Ca
2+)
of this mutant is very similar compared to the wild-type
(Table 1). Moreover, as shown in Table 1 in the Mg2+
alone reaction the rate of cleavage of pATSerUGG/C was
only modestly reduced in keeping with our previous data
(5). By contrast in the presence of Sr2+, appKd was determined
to be 6.5- to 2.5-fold lower relative to wild-type at 40 and
160 mM Sr2+, respectively, indicating an improved ground
state binding for this mutant in the presence of Sr2+. Cleavage
under single turnover conditions as a function of [Sr2+]
revealed that the C294 mutant cleaved the substrate more
efficiently compared to the wild-type. This was observed to
be the case irrespective of whether Mg2+ or Pb2+ promoted
cleavage was studied (Figure 4; data only shown for the case
when 8 mM Pb2+ was used). This was further corroborated
when we determined kobs for M1C294 RNA under the condi-
tions indicated in Table 1. Here we observed a 2.6-fold
increase at 40 mM Sr2+/8 mM Mg2+ and a 4.1-fold increase
at 40 mM Sr2+/8 mM Pb2+. At 160 mM Sr2+/8 mM Pb2+, we
observed only a 1.8-fold increase relative to wild-type again
indicating (see above) that higher concentration of Sr2+ inhib-
its the rate of cleavage under these conditions. These findings
suggested that changes of the structural architecture of the
+73/294 interaction influence metal ion binding most likely
in its vicinity (MeA in Figure 1C; see also below). We argue
that as a consequence, this affects the rate of cleavage possibly
due to a repositioning of the metal ion involved in generating
the nucleophile. This further indicates the role of metal ions
bound at different sites in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage
[see also Ref (9)].
Identification of a residue in RNase P RNA affecting
positioning of Pb2+
The efficiency of the Pb2+/Sr2+ promoted cleavage for Yer P
RNA was lower compared to that of M1 RNA. The secondary
structures of these two RNase P RNAs are very similar and
differences were identified in four regions: C125A, U333G,
U364C (residue in M1 RNA underlined) and AUAA in M1
RNA (see Figure 4) while Yer P RNA carries GCAU at this
site. This gave us a way to identify other residues/regions in
RNase P RNA potentially involved in positioning Pb2+ in the
vicinity of the cleavage site. Thus, we generated four Yer P
RNA variants carrying C125, U333, U364 and AUAA269 (M1
RNA numbering; Figure 4) to investigate whether the Yer P
RNA activity could be rescued. As shown in Figure 5, only the
C to U replacement at 364 resulted in an increased cleavage
activity while the other changes did not. This was observed
both in the Pb2+/Sr2+ and Mg2+ promoted reactions. Neither of
these changes affected ground state binding (Table 1). These
findings raise the possibility that the residue at 364 in Yer P
RNA influenced positioning of the Pb2+ in the vicinity of the
cleavage site.
DISCUSSION
Lead(II) ion is an efficient inducer of hydrolysis of the phos-
phate backbone of RNA generating 50OH and 20;30P as cleav-
age products (2,3). Here we showed that RNase P RNA is able
to cleave its substrate at the canonical site in the presence of
the Pb2+ and Sr2+ or Co(NH3)6
3+.
The pKa value for Sr
2+ is significantly higher compared to
Mg2+ and Ca2+ that do promote RNase P RNA mediated
cleavage (2,7). In a previous study Sr2+ was demonstrated
to promote cleavage at elevated pH, pH 9 (14). Thus, one
could argue that Pb2+ binding in the RS-complex ‘activates’
Sr2+ that subsequently results in generation of the nucleophile.
Here we observed RNase P RNA mediated cleavage in the
presence of Pb2+/Sr2+ at a significantly lower pH (6.1 and 7.2).
When present alone, Sr2+ (or Co(NH3)6
3+) has not been demon-
strated to promote cleavage by RNase P RNA under these

conditions, i.e. at pH < 7.5 [(9) and this report]. Also, an
increase in the Sr2+ concentration resulted in inhibition of
cleavage. Moreover, mixing Pb2+ with Co(NH3)6
3+ resulted
in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage and increasing concen-
tration of Co(NH3)6
3+ also inhibited cleavage. Together this
argues against ‘activation’ of Sr2+. Rather the role of Sr2+
(or Co(NH3)6
3+) is suggested to promote RNA folding and
facilitate/stabilize the interaction with the substrate. Note
that available data suggest that RNase P RNA is not correctly
folded as well as that it is efficiently cleaved in the presence of
only Pb2+ (21). Our data also argues against the presence of
contamination of e.g. Mg2+ in our solutions. We conclude that
our data are consistent with a model where Pb2+ most likely is
responsible for generating the nucleophile. To conclusively
demonstrate that this is indeed the case will require detailed
structural analysis of the RNase P RNA substrate complex.
Compared to Mg2+ that is the preferred metal(II) ion in
promotion of RNase P RNA mediated cleavage, Pb2+ shows
different physico-chemical properties but their preferred
coordination numbers are similar: Pb2+ 6 to 8 and Mg2+ 6
(36). Moreover, although the softer Pb2+ ion is larger than
Mg2+, Pb2+ and Mg2+ bind to overlapping sites (2). This,
together with that Pb2+ can act as an efficient general base
(pKa 7.8) as well as the similarity in coordination numbers
might be the only reasons to why Pb2+ can promote RNase P
RNA mediated cleavage. Whether other criteria also has to be
fulfilled remains to be elucidated. But, unlike lead(II)-induced
hydrolysis or that by the in vitro evolved leadzyme which
generate 50OH and 20;30P as cleavage products (37), Pb2+-
promoted cleavage by RNase P RNA resulted in 50P and
30OH. Therefore, the mechanism of cleavage has to be differ-
ent and, in the case of RNase P RNA the nucleophilic attack
has to come from the opposite side relative to the positioning
of the 20OH at the cleavage site (Figure 1C). Available data
suggest that H2O is the nucleophile in RNase P RNA mediated
cleavage (13,17,24). In keeping with this we demonstrated that
cleavage by RNase P RNA in the presence of Pb2+/Sr2+ is
linearly dependent on [OH] (see above). Thus, most likely
a H2O ligand is also the nucleophile in RNase P RNA cleavage
in the presence of Pb2+ i.e. Pb2+ acts as a general base. To our
knowledge this is the first time that Pb2+ has been suggested to
activate H2O to act as a nucleophile in RNA mediated cleav-
age of RNA. To conclude, our present finding that Pb2+ likely
act as a catalytic metal ion in M1 RNA mediated cleavage
gives us a handle to identify factors/chemical groups that
promote M1 RNA mediated cleavage and suppress cleavage
of the phosphate backbone in the 50 leader due to activation of
neighboring 20OH groups and thereby increase our under-
standing of cleavage of RNA by RNA.
Close and distant residues affect positioning of
Pb2+ in the RS-complex
Based on the discussion above Pb2+ promotes cleavage at and
in the vicinity of the RNase P cleavage site both in the absence
and presence of RNase P RNA (Figure 3), where efficient
cleavage at the canonical site (with correct cleavage products
and G at +1) was only observed in its presence. Hence, it is
conceivable that Pb2+ positioned in the vicinity of the cleavage
site is re-positioned as a result of formation of the RS-complex
arguing for the possibility that the metal ion responsible for
generating the nucleophile is associated with the substrate
[Figure 1C; (5,15,16)]. The importance of the structural archi-
tecture of the +1/+72 for metal ion binding in the vicinity of
the cleavage site as well as the finding that the presence of the
exocyclic amine at position 2 of the guanosine at +1 is import-
ant for M1 RNA mediated cleavage in the presence of Pb2+ is
in keeping with this model [(12); this report; unpublished
data]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the
metal(II) ion(s) involved in generating the nucleophile is
recruited from the solution or is associated with RNase P
RNA e.g. Me2+ bound in the P4 helix (8).
Irrespective of whether MeB (Figure 1C) is associated with
the substrate, RNase P RNA or is recruited from the solution,
our data indicate that the structural architecture of the +73/294
interaction influenced the rate of cleavage promoted in the
presence of Pb2+ as well as metal(II) binding in its vicinity.
This is consistent with our previous findings where we showed
that the structural architecture of the +73/294 interaction, that
is part of the RCCA–RNase P RNA interaction (25), affects
the charge distribution at the cleavage site, ground state bind-
ing, rate of cleavage and metal ion binding in its vicinity
[(5,9,11,26,38); this report]. Thus, our present findings provide
further evidence for cross talk between the +73/294 interaction
and the site of cleavage and experimental evidence for the
involvement of metal ion(s) in this process.
Our data also indicate that U364 in M1 RNA is likely to
influence positioning of Pb2+ in the vicinity of the cleavage
site. The significance of this finding is not clear yet but it might
indicate that either that this region is positioned in the vicinity
of the cleavage site or that this change results in distance
effects e.g. by affecting positioning of the metal(II) ions posi-
tioned in the P4 helix [(8); see above]. However, based on the
recent RNase P RNA crystal structures the former alternative
is less likely (39,40). Clearly we need to investigate this in
further detail but nonetheless this finding opens for new pos-
sibilities and approaches using hybrid RNase P RNA
molecules in our efforts to understand the complex orchestra-
tion in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage. In this context we
note that the classical double mutant M1 RNA ts709 carries a
G to A change at 365. However, no phenotype has been linked
to this change [(41–43); L. A. Kirsebom and S. Altman,
unpublished data). Thus, our findings raise the possibility
that this mutation indeed influences M1 RNA mediated cleav-
age by affecting positioning of the metal ion(s) involved in
activating the nucleophile.
Structural evidence for positioning a metal(II) ion at
the RNase P cleavage site
Our present and previous data clearly indicate that a divalent
metal ion(s) is positioned close to the RNase P cleavage site
(5,13–24). The high-resolution structure of the RNase P cleav-
age site is not yet available. However, we noticed that the
structures of the ends of the leadzyme are almost identical
to the sequences at and in the vicinity of the pATSerCGG/C
and pATSerCGU/A cleavage sites with the exception that in
the case of the ‘G+1/C+72’ variant the C1 is single stranded
[Figure 6; (44)]. But in another high-resolution structure of
SRP RNA in which the structure at one of the ends is also
identical to the sequence of the pATSerCGG/C cleavage site
the C1 is base paired to a G as in pATSerCGG/C [Figure 6;

(45)]. These structural studies suggested that a hexahydrated
Mg2+ is bound in the deep groove in the vicinity of the base
pairs that would correspond to G+1/C+72 and U+1/A+72,
respectively, in our substrates. Superimposing the three
Mg2+ binding sites revealed no apparent structural differences.
But, the positioning of Mg2+ is suggested to be shifted >7 s
due to the G+1/C+72 to U+1/A+72 replacement, while formation
of the ‘C1/G+73’ base pair only gives a shift of 2.2 s. In our
substrates this would correspond to the Mg2+ near the cleavage
site. This supports our functional data suggesting that U/A at
+1/+72 affects Pb2+ as well as Mg2+ binding most likely in the
vicinity of the cleavage site [(12); this study]. Hence, we
suggest that there is a functionally important Mg2+, most likely
in the hexahydrated state, positioned in the deep groove at the
cleavage site. Based on this model it is apparent that hexahy-
drated Mg2+ is positioned close to the cleavage site (7–8 s)
and to the phosphorous centers of +1, 1 and 2 (Figure 6).
Assuming that this is the metal ion that is involved in gener-
ating the nucleophile (see above) a repositioning has to occur
as a result of the interaction with RNase P RNA to ensure
cleavage at +1 i.e. positioning of the nucleophile for an in
line attack on the +1 phosphorous center. During this
conformational rearrangement, the data suggest that the ‘73/
294 interaction’, residue 364 and the exocyclic amine of G+1 in
the substrate play important roles (see above). At the same
time, attack on the phosphorous center at1 and2 should be
avoided. In the case of cleavage in the presence of Pb2+ this is
not observed due to that Pb2+ is very efficient to activate the
neighboring 20OH to act as a nucleophile while Mg2+ is sig-
nificantly less efficient (2). This rationalizes why cleavage at
other positions within the 50 leader under Pb2+/Sr2+ conditions
even in the presence of M1 RNA was observed.
Concluding remarks
RNase P RNA is the first natural ribozyme demonstrated to
show leadzyme-like activity. Hence, our findings raise the
question whether other ribozymes can mediate catalysis
using Pb2+. In this context we note that Mg2+ and Mn2+ pro-
mote correct splicing while Mn2+ also induce cleavage at an
additional site in the Group I intron. However, Pb2+ does not
promote splicing but induce cleavage at the additional site due
to that Pb2+ do not promote correct folding (46,47). In view of
our present findings it would be of interest to test whether Pb2+
in combination with other divalent metal ions e.g. Sr2+ can
promote Group I intron splicing. To the best of our knowledge
this has not been tested.
