ABSTRACT
Increased proliferation and elevated levels of
protein synthesis are characteristics of transformed
and tumor cells. Though components of the trans-
lation machinery are often misregulated in cancers,
what role tRNA plays in cancer cells has not been
explored. We compare genome-wide tRNA expres-
sion in cancer-derived versus non-cancer-derived
breast cell lines, as well as tRNA expression
in breast tumors versus normal breast tissues.
In cancer-derived versus non-cancer-derived cell
lines, nuclear-encoded tRNAs increase by up to
3-fold and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs increase
by up to 5-fold. In tumors versus normal breast
tissues, both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded
tRNAs increase up to 10-fold. This tRNA over-
expression is selective and coordinates with the
properties of cognate amino acids. Nuclear- and
mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs exhibit distinct
expression patterns, indicating that tRNAs can be
used as biomarkers for breast cancer. We also per-
formed association analysis for codon usage-tRNA
expression for the cell lines. tRNA isoacceptor
expression levels are not geared towards optimal
translation of house-keeping or cell line specific
genes. Instead, tRNA isoacceptor expression
levels may favor the translation of cancer-related
genes having regulatory roles. Our results suggest
a functional consequence of tRNA over-expression
in tumor cells. tRNA isoacceptor over-expression
may increase the translational efficiency of genes
relevant to cancer development and progression.
INTRODUCTION
Misregulation of components of the translation machinery
can lead to malignant transformation (1–3). In particular,
deregulation of RNA polymerase III (polIII) and its
products has been observed in a wide range of trans-
formed cells, including ovarian and breast carcinomas
(4–8). Over-expressed polIII RNAs include transfer
RNAs (tRNA) which are directly involved in translation.
A recent report demonstrates that such deregulation is not
only a by-product but can drive transformation (9). In
that study, modest over-expression of initiator tRNA
drives cell proliferation and results in malignant transfor-
mation of immortalized mouse ﬁbroblasts. As for other
tRNAs, their expression or activity can control trans-
lational elongation because they read mRNA codons
embedded in the coding sequence of each gene at
various speeds (10). tRNA levels may therefore be
relevant for the translation of key genes required for the
tumorigenic process, and may play a central role in cancer
development and progression.
A major challenge in cancer research is the identiﬁca-
tion of accurate molecular signatures for diagnosis and
treatment (11–13). Though diverse genomic and pro-
teomic approaches have been applied to this problem,
no genome-wide studies of tRNA expression have been
carried out in the context of breast cancer. Approximately
450 tRNA genes comprised of over 270 diﬀerent sequences
have been annotated in the human genome, with 22 addi-
tional genes present in human mitochondrial DNA
(14,15). Human tRNAs are grouped into 49 isoacceptor
families to decode all codons speciﬁed by the genetic
code (16).
Here we describe the comparative analysis of tRNA
levels for non-cancer-derived breast epithelial cell lines
and breast cancer cell lines, as well as breast tumor and
normal breast tissue samples. We apply a previously
described tRNA microarray used to study tissue-speciﬁc
expression of human tRNAs (17). We show that tRNA
levels are signiﬁcantly elevated for both tumor cell lines
and tumor tissues. We also develop a chemical ligation
method and apply it in a microarray format for the detec-
tion and comparison of all tRNA isoacceptors in the
breast cell lines. We perform association analysis of

tRNA isoacceptors to the codon usage of the house-
keeping genes, the cell line-speciﬁc genes, and cancer-
related genes. We ﬁnd that the cell line-speciﬁc genes
and cancer-related genes have similar codon usages that
are distinct from house-keeping genes. Over-expressed
tRNA isoacceptors do not favor the codon usage of the
house-keeping genes or the cell line-speciﬁc genes. Instead,
a subset of the over-expressed tRNAs favors over-
represented codons among the cancer-related genes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and RNA isolation
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained accor-
ding to ATCC recommendations. MCF7 cells were
cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, 11965-092) sup-
plemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(P/S). MCF10A cells were cultured in 1:1 (+I factor,
Vectro)-DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, 11330-032) supple-
mented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 5 mg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml
EGF and 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone. All other cell lines
were cultured in RPMI 1640 1medium (Mediatech,
10-040-CV) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S.
Total RNA for each cell line was obtained at 80–90%
conﬂuency using the mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion, AM1560). This procedure isolates RNA
species as short as 15 nucleotides and is therefore not
biased against tRNA. Total RNA quality was veriﬁed
on an agarose gel.
Normal breast and breast tumor total RNA
Two samples of human breast total RNA were purchased
from Ambion (FirstChoice Human Breast Total RNA,
AM6952, lot numbers 0808001 and 0812006). An addi-
tional sample of human breast total RNA was purchased
from Stratagene (MVP Total RNA Human Breast,
540045, lot number 0380023). Both providers certify
small RNA content in total RNA samples and provide
relevant donor information (Table S1).
Breast tumor samples were obtained from the Human
Tissue Resource Center (HTRC) at the University of
Chicago (Table S1). Pathology reports were provided for
all samples. All breast tumor samples were obtained
frozen and embedded in OCT (optimal cutting tempera-
ture compound). Following removal of the surrounding
OCT and tissue pulverization, total RNA was isolated
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596-018). Total
RNA quality was checked on agarose gels.
Chemical ligation substrates and templates
All oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an
Expedite Nucleic Acid Synthesis System. 50-Iodo-
oligodeoxyribonucleotides were prepared by reacting
the 50-OH of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide which
remains on a solid support with methyltriphenoxyphos-
phonium iodide, followed by standard deprotection.
30-Phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotides were
prepared using a 30-phosphate CPG column
(Glen Research). After the ﬁrst coupling with the
phosphoramidite, the phosphorus was sulfurized with
Sulfurizing Reagent II (Glen research) instead of
oxidized with iodine. Synthesis and deprotection pro-
ceeded as with standard DNA synthesis.
30-mer RNA template oligonucleotides were designed
to contain minimal secondary structure when the
nucleotide at the 15th position is U (18). Four chemically
synthesized 30-mer RNAs have the same sequence at all
positions except the 16th nucleotide (I, U, G, C).
Chemically synthesized 30-mer RNAs were purchased
from Dharmacon Research, de-protected, and puriﬁed
according to manufacturer’s protocols. When needed,
RNA oligonucleotides were puriﬁed on denaturing
polyacrylamide gels containing 7M urea. Yeast tRNAPhe
was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (R4018) and used
without further puriﬁcation.
Chemical ligation reactions
For 30-mer model RNAs, reactions were carried out with
0.2mM RNA template, 0.7 mM 50-iodo probe, and 0.5 mM
50-32P-labeled, 30-phosphorothioate probe in 50mM pH
7.5 Tris–HCl containing 1.5mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl,
and 1mM TCEP at 30C for 1 h. tRNAPhe reactions were
carried out with 0.05–0.15 mM RNA template, 0.26 mM
50-iodo substrate, and 0.065mM 50-32P-labeled,
30-phosphorothioate probe in 20mM pH 7.5 Tris–HCl
containing 1.5mM EDTA, 200mM NaCl, and 1mM
TCEP at 60C for 24 h. Total human RNA reactions
were carried out with 1–6 mg total RNA, 0.26 mM each
50-iodo substrate, and 0.065 mM each Cy3-labeled,
30-phosphorothioate probe in 20 ml 20mM pH 7.5 Tris–
HCl containing 1.5mM EDTA, 200mM NaCl, and 1mM
TCEP. Reactions were incubated at 60C for 24 h.
Following ligation, all reaction mixtures were treated
with 0.1U/ml RNase H (Epicentre Biotechnologies,
R0601K). The reactions were quenched with an equal
volume of 8M urea/100mM EDTA, boiled for 2min
and rapidly cooled on ice prior to loading on 10–15%
denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7M urea.
Radiolabeled ligation products were visualized on a
FUJIX BAS1000 Phosphorimager and quantiﬁed using
the accompanying software. Fluorescent-labeled ligation
products were visualized on a PharosFX Molecular
Imager and quantiﬁed using QuantityOne software.
Standard tRNA microarrays
The standard tRNA microarray experiment consists of
four steps starting from total RNA: (i) deacylation to
remove remaining amino acids attached to the tRNA,
(ii) selective Cy3/Cy5 labeling of tRNA, (iii) hybridization
on commercially printed arrays and (iv) data analysis.
(i) Deacylation: 0.25mg/ml total RNA premixed with
three tRNA standards (Escherichia coli tRNALys,
E. coli tRNATyr, and yeast tRNAPhe) at 0.2 mM
each was incubated in 100mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.0)
at 37C for 30min. The solution was neutralized by
the addition of an equal volume of 100mM Na-
acetate/acetic acid (pH 4.8) plus 100mM NaCl,
followed by ethanol precipitation. Deacylated total
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 21 7269
RNA was dissolved in water, and its integrity
veriﬁed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
(ii) Cy3/Cy5 labeling: tRNA in the total RNA mixture
was selectively labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5
ﬂuorophore using an enzymatic ligation method
previously described. The ligation reaction relies
on an 8-base pair RNA:DNA hybrid helix contain-
ing a Cy3 or Cy5 ﬂuorophore pre-attached to the
loop and an overhang complementary to the univer-
sally conserved 30CCA nucleotides present in all
tRNAs. The ligation reaction was carried out over-
night (16 h) at 16C with 1U/ml T4 DNA ligase
(USB Corporation, 70042X) and 9 mM labeling
oligonucleotide.
(iii) Hybridization: hybridization was performed in a
GeneMachines Hyb4 at 60C overnight (16 h) with
1–2.5 mg each of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled total RNA as
previously described. Multiple arrays were run using
the MCF10A reference sample labeled with either
Cy3 or Cy5.
(iv) Data analysis: arrays were scanned using a GenePix
4000b scanner (Axon Instruments). For both Cy3
and Cy5 wavelengths, PMT gain was set at 600
and power at 100%. These settings were chosen to
provide optimal signal without saturation. Array
images were generated and analyzed using
GenePix 6.0 software. GenePix adaptive circle spot
segmentation was used for image analysis. To
account for diﬀerences in labeling and hybridization
eﬃciencies, the following normalization procedure
was used: ﬁrst, the median Cy5/Cy3 ratio at each
probe spot was divided by the corresponding
MCF10A Cy5/Cy3 reference ratio. Second, the
obtained value was divided by the averaged Cy5/
Cy3 ratio value for the three tRNA standards
added in (i) (E. coli tRNALys, E. coli tRNATyr
and yeast tRNAPhe).
The standard microarray method described above uses
a very standard, two-color microarray method extensively
used for mRNA analysis. Compared to mRNA arrays, the
main diﬀerence is the previously developed method for
the labeling of tRNA in total RNA samples. The repro-
ducibility of the tRNA array method and result validation
by Northern blots have been extensively described in
previously published papers (17,19–22).
All microarray data has been deposited in GEOarchive
(accession numbers GSE17945, GPL9143).
Chemical ligation tRNA Microarrays
These microarray experiments consist of four steps starting
from total RNA: (i) chemical ligation to detect target
tRNA isoacceptors, (ii) puriﬁcation of chemical ligation
products, (iii) hybridization, and (iv) data analysis.
(i) Chemical ligation: 5 mg total RNA was premixed
with 4 pmol each of three tRNA standards (E. coli
tRNALys, E. coli tRNATyr, and yeast tRNAPhe).
Reactions were carried out with 5 mg total RNA,
0.26 mM of each 50-iodo probe, and 0.065 mM of
each Cy3- or Cy5-labeled, 30-phosphorothioate
probe in 50 ml 15mM pH 7.5 Tris–HCl containing
1mM EDTA, 200mM NaCl, and 1mM TCEP.
Reactions were incubated at 60C for 24 h, and
then treated with 0.1U/ml RNase H. The reactions
were quenched with an equal volume of 8M urea/
100mM EDTA, then boiled for 2min and rapidly
cooled on ice prior to loading on 10% denaturing
polyacrylamide gels containing 7M urea.
(ii) Puriﬁcation: chemical ligation products were
puriﬁed on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels
containing 7M urea. Ligation products were
visualized on a PharosFX Molecular Imager, and
the corresponding band cut out for puriﬁcation.
(iii) Hybridization.
(iv) Data analysis: these are identical to those for the
standard arrays described above.
Cell proliferation
Proliferation rates were measured over four days using the
Promega CellTiter Blue metabolic assay. Cells were plated
at low (1500 cells/well) and high (5000 cells/well) cell
density in 100 ml medium in 96 well-plates. A total of
20 ml CellTiter Blue reagent was added to each well at
the indicated timepoints. Fluorescence (560ex/590em)
was measured after 2 h incubation at 37C. Fluorescence
is proportional to the number of cells present and is
normalized to ﬂuorescence at day 0 to account for
diﬀerences in metabolic eﬃciency across cell lines.
Doubling times were obtained from the equation
N/N0=e
(kt). All measurements were performed in
triplicate.
RESULTS
Over-expression of tRNAs in breast cancer cell lines
To our knowledge, no systematic genome-wide studies of
tRNA expression have been carried out in cancer. To
explore the potential of tRNAs to deﬁne breast cancer
signatures, we used tRNA microarrays to generate com-
parative tRNA proﬁles for three non-cancer-derived
breast epithelial cell lines (MCF10A, 184 A1, 184 B5)
and six breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, HCC70, MCF7,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, ZR-75-1). The breast
cancer cell lines cover a range of physiological and molec-
ular properties (Table S2). Importantly, genome-wide
mRNA expression data are available for these cell lines
(23) to allow tRNA expression and codon usage associa-
tion analysis.
We used a previously described array method in the
studies of tissue-speciﬁc expression of human tRNAs
(17). Arrays used for this study contain 40 probes for
human nuclear-encoded tRNAs and 22 probes for
human mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs; each probe is
repeated 21 times. The array also includes 42 probes for
bacterial tRNAs and 275 probes complementary to short
regions in yeast and human rRNA as hybridization and
speciﬁcity controls. After isolation of total RNA from cell
culture, tRNAs in the sample are labeled by selective
ligation to a ﬂuorophore-containing oligonucleotide.
7270 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 21
The labeled samples are hybridized directly onto the array
(Figure 1A). The MCF10A (a non-cancer-derived breast
epithelial cell line) sample was included as a reference in
all array hybridizations to correct for variations in ﬂuo-
rescence labeling and array manufacturing. Since tRNA
constitutes up to 30% of the total RNA, the method
requires no ampliﬁcation and only 1–2 mg of total RNA
per array. The speciﬁcity of the array is illustrated by the
ﬂuorescence signals derived from human tRNA probes
compared to the non-human tRNA probes (Figure 1B
and C).
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences are observed in the expression
levels of tRNA among non-cancer-derived and cancer-
derived breast cell lines (Figure 2A and C). The global
level of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs can
be approximated separately by the median and mean
sample-to-MCF10A ratio. For nuclear-encoded tRNAs,
this ratio is 0.7–0.8 for the other non-cancer-derived cell
lines and 2–3 for the cancer-derived cell lines. These
diﬀerences are even more pronounced for mitochondrial-
encoded tRNA levels: the sample-to-MCF10A ratio for
non-cancer-derived cell lines is 0.75, but as much as 5
for the cancer-derived cell lines.
The over-expression of tRNA in cancer-derived rela-
tive to non-cancer-derived cell lines is also selective:
certain individual tRNAs are more strongly over-
expressed than others (Figure 2C). Variations in the
relative expression of nuclear-encoded tRNAs carrying
certain amino acid types are readily observed across
cancer-derived cell lines. For example, nuclear-encoded
tRNAs carrying polar amino acids (e.g. Ser, Thr, and
Tyr) are up-regulated 3- to 4-fold in breast cancer cell
lines relative to MCF10A, while nuclear-encoded
tRNAs carrying small amino acids (Ala, Cys, Gly, Pro)
are up-regulated only 1.5- to 2-fold. These diﬀerences
can be observed more clearly when the tRNA expression
is normalized to the median value for either nuclear-
or mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs within each cell line
(Figure 2C and D). Diﬀerences in the relative expression
of tRNA isoacceptors also become more apparent after
normalization. For example, tRNALys(UUU) is expressed
strongly above the median, while tRNALys(CUU)
is expressed below the median. All breast cancer cell
lines exhibit a remarkable similarity in relative tRNA
expression patterns: tRNAArg(UCU), tRNAArg(CCU),
tRNAThr (CGU), tRNASer(CGA), and tRNATyr(GTA) are
among the most over-expressed tRNAs, while
tRNAHis(GTG), tRNAPhe (GAA), and tRNAMet(CAT) are
among the least over-expressed tRNAs. Selective
up-regulation of tRNA levels is also observed for
mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs: certain tRNAs are exp-
ressed up to 2-fold above median, and others are
expressed 4-fold below median. While nuclear-encoded
tRNA expression patterns are remarkably similar across
cell lines, mitochondrial-encoded tRNA expression
patterns exhibit greater variations.
tRNA over-expression determined by the microarray
method does not necessarily mean that the amount of
total tRNA in the cell is increased by the same extent.
The median increase for each tRNA species is weighted
equally in the microarray measurements regardless of their
absolute abundance, whereas abundant tRNAs are over-
represented in the total tRNA. Quantitative comparison
of total RNA samples by gel electrophoresis shows that
the cancer-derived cells still have globally elevated tRNA
levels (1.2- to 1.4-fold, Figure 2B), although this increase
in total tRNA is smaller compared to the microarray
measurements (2- to 3-fold over the median increase).
This result highlights the over-expression of low
abundant tRNAs in breast cancer cells. Because each
tRNA species functions separately in decoding, changes
in low-abundant tRNA levels as measured by microarrays
should have greater functional signiﬁcance.
We also determined that tRNA over-expression in
breast cancer cell lines does not simply reﬂect an
increase in proliferation rate (Table S3). Under the
culture conditions used in this study, doubling times
range from 21 to 47 h for the non-cancer-derived cell
lines, versus 15–35 h for the cancer-derived cell lines.
Thus, the proliferation of all three non-cancer-derived
cell lines with low tRNA content is comparable to that
of breast cancer cell lines with much higher tRNA content.
Doubling times do not correlate with either nuclear or
mitochondrial global tRNA levels (not shown).

tRNA over-expression in patient-derived
breast tumor samples
In all breast cancer cell lines examined, we observe global
tRNA over-expression and diﬀerential tRNA isoacceptor
expression. To generalize our results in cell lines to breast
tumor tissue, we measured tRNA expression patterns in
nine patient-derived breast tumor samples and three
normal breast tissue samples (Table S3). The nine breast
tumor samples were selected from the three major
subtypes of breast cancer: luminal (ER+, HER2),
basal (ER, HER2), and HER2+. For consistency of
data analysis, all samples were run using MCF10A as a
reference in array experiments.
As in the breast cancer cell lines, we observe signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in global tRNA expression levels among breast
tumor and normal breast samples (Figure 3A and B). For
nuclear-encoded tRNAs, the mean sample-to-MCF10A
ratio is 0.2 to 0.5 for normal breast tissue samples,
versus 2 to 4 for breast tumor samples. This result
indicates that global nuclear-encoded tRNA levels are
increased up to 20-fold in breast tumors relative to
normal breast. For mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs, the
mean sample-to-MCF10A ratio is 0.4 to 1 for normal
breast tissue samples, versus 1.2 to 5 for breast tumor
samples. This result indicates that global mitochondrial-
encoded tRNA levels are increased up to 13-fold in breast
tumors relative to normal breast.
Consistent with our results on cell lines, tRNA over-
expression in breast tumor samples is also selective:
certain individual tRNAs are more strongly over-
expressed than others (Figure 3C). Among the top 10
over-expressed, nuclear-encoded tRNAs, six tRNA
species overlap between cell lines and tumor tissues:
tRNAArg(CCU), tRNAThr(CGU), tRNALeu(UAA),
tRNATyr(GUA), tRNASer(GCU) and tRNAArg(UCU). We
readily observe variations in the relative expression of
both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs. These
variations correlate with both the cognate amino acid type
and tRNA isoacceptor identity. For example, tRNAs
carrying polar (Ser, Thr, Tyr) and charged (Arg, Glu,
Lys) amino acids are upregulated 2- to 8-fold, while
tRNAs carrying small amino acids (Ala, Cys, Gly, Pro)
are upregulated only 1.5- to 2-fold. We also observe
variations in the relative expression of tRNA isoacceptors.
For example, tRNAArg(CCU) and tRNALys(UUU) are over-
expressed to a greater extent than tRNAArg(ICG) and
tRNALys(CUU), respectively. These variations become
more clear when tRNA expression levels are normalized
to the median value within each sample (Figure 3D).
Interestingly, the tRNA expression patterns in the three
major sub-types of breast cancer are very similar, suggest-
ing that tRNA over-expression is a general consequence
for all breast tumors.
We conclude that elevated tRNA levels are a hallmark
of breast cancer. Our results suggest that tRNAs can be
used as biomarkers for breast cancer, although it is best
suited to determine cancer versus normal breast cells.
Furthermore, tRNA expression measured by microarrays
more accurately reﬂects the ‘‘functional abundance’’ of
individual tRNA species.
Detecting single-nucleotide diﬀerences between
tRNA isoacceptors
tRNA over-expression across breast cancer cells suggests
that elevated tRNA levels may be of functional signiﬁ-
cance. For instance, diﬀerential expression of tRNA
isoacceptors may enhance translation of speciﬁc cancer-
related genes via their codon usages. In order to perform
tRNA expression and codon usage association analysis,
more comprehensive proﬁling of all tRNA isoacceptors
is desired. Because the microarray method used above
works by hybridization alone, it can only distinguish
between tRNAs that diﬀer by at least eight nucleotides
(17). However, several human tRNA isoacceptors diﬀer
by less than eight nucleotides (Table S4). For example,
the proline isoacceptors tRNAPro(IGG), tRNAPro(CGG)
and tRNAPro(UGG) diﬀer by only one nucleotide; they all
hybridize to the same probe on the array above.
We therefore modiﬁed a previously described
non-enzymatic, nucleic acid-templated, phosphor-
othioate-iodide autoligation chemistry (24,25) to detect
single-base diﬀerences between tRNA isoacceptors. This
method involves the reaction of a phosphorothioate at the
30-end of one DNA oligo with an iodide leaving group on
the 50-end of the other oligo (Figure 4A).
In order to determine whether the above set-up allows
single base discrimination, we performed chemical ligation
using a series of model 30-mer RNAs that diﬀer by a
single nucleotide at the 16th position (U15I16, U15C16,
U15U16, U15G16) (Figure 4B). While the 5
0-iodo substrate
was always fully complementary to the RNA template, the
base at the 30-end of the 30-phosphorothioate substrate
was varied (X=A, G, C. X=T was not examined
because no tRNA isoacceptor contains A34). For
example, when ligations are carried out in deﬁned
mixtures of U15I16 and U15C16 templates, the amount of
product obtained with the X=C 30-phosphorothioate
substrate increases linearly as the amount of U15I16
template increases. Conversely, the amount of product
obtained with the X=G 30-phosphorothioate substrate
decreases linearly as the amount of U15C16 template
decreases (Figure 4C). Similar results are obtained with
other template–substrate combinations.
In order to conﬁrm that the chemical ligation method
works with tRNA, we ﬁrst applied this method to puriﬁed
yeast tRNAPhe which has G34 (Figure 4D). The ligation
product obtained with mismatched 30-phosphorothioate
substrates (X=A, G) is less than 10% the ligation
product obtained with the matched 30-phosphorothioate
substrate (X =C). This conﬁrms that phosphorothioate–
iodide autoligation chemistry successfully discriminates
in favor of complementary nucleotides at the ligation
junction on full-length tRNA templates. Finally, we
examined whether human tRNAs could be detected
and quantiﬁed in a total RNA sample using this auto-
ligation chemistry (Figure 4E). The amount of ligation
product obtained with 50-iodo and 30-phosphorothioate
substrates complementary to tRNAPro(UGG),
tRNAPro(IGG), and tRNAArg(UCG) increases linearly
with the amount of total human RNA, and therefore
reﬂects the amount of tRNA present in the reaction.

We then applied this chemical ligation method to
simultaneously detect and compare selected tRNA
isoacceptors in total RNA samples on a microarray
platform (Figure 5A). 50-Iodo and 30-phosphorothioate
oligonucleotide substrates were designed against all
tRNA isoacceptors in pairs diﬀering by less than eight
nucleotides (Table S4). For each pair, two
30-phosphorothioate substrates were synthesized with the
ﬁrst favoring one and the second favoring the other
isoacceptor. The ligation junction was placed between
U33 of the tRNA and the ﬁrst position of the anticodon.
Our chemical ligation microarray includes 10 sense tRNA
probes complementary to expected ligation products, 6
sense tRNA probes not complementary to expected
ligation products, and 79 antisense tRNA probes comple-
mentary to human tRNAs; each probe is repeated eight
times. We established the speciﬁcity of the human tRNA
array by examining the cross-hybridization of chemical
ligation products to complementary and control probes
present on the same array (Figure 5B).
Chemical ligation results also show overall elevated
tRNA levels in breast cancer cell lines relative to breast

epithelial cell lines (Figure 5C and D). Again, the up-
regulation of tRNA levels in cancer-derived relative to
non-cancer-derived cells is selective. For instance,
tRNAVal(CAC) is decreased 2- to 3-fold in the breast
cancer cell lines relative to MCF10A while tRNAVal(IAC)
remains unchanged. Similar results are observed for
tRNASer(UGA)/tRNASer(IGA) and tRNAAla(CGC)/
tRNAAla(UGC).
In conclusion, we successfully developed a microarray
method that has a single nucleotide resolution for tRNA
isoacceptors. Its application provides comprehensive
proﬁles of all tRNA isoacceptors for breast cancer cell
lines.
Relative tRNA abundance and codon usage associations
The diﬀerential expression of tRNA isoacceptors can be
used to regulate translational eﬃciency via the codon
usage of speciﬁc genes. In prokaryotes and fungi,
diﬀerences in the abundance of tRNA isoacceptors are
correlated with codon preferences of genes encoding
highly expressed proteins and impact the synthesis of

these proteins (26–28). In humans, tissue-speciﬁc
diﬀerences in the expression of individual tRNA species
can correlate to the codon usage of highly-expressed,
tissue-speciﬁc genes, although this correlation was seen
only for a small number of tissues (17).
tRNA isoacceptor levels in breast cancer cell lines may
also correlate or associate with the codon usage of certain
genes that are important for cancer. Finding such
associations would suggest an additional level of
translational regulation for breast cancer cell lines, and
by extension for breast cancer in vivo. At least three
groups of genes are relevant in seeking codon usage-
tRNA association for cancer cell lines: cell-line speciﬁc
genes, cancer-related genes and house-keeping genes
(Figure 6A). Cell-line speciﬁc genes can be important for
distinct tumorigenic properties across cell lines; cancer-
related genes can be important for general tumor initiation
and progression; and house-keeping genes are important
for cell growth and architecture.
To identify cell line-speciﬁc genes, we used publicly
available mRNA expression data ((http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/arrayexpress/, accession number E-TABM-157). Cell
line-speciﬁc genes were selected based on mRNA expres-
sion levels (7- to 15-fold above the median expression level
determined for all genes) and high cell line/MCF10A
expression ratios (top 20–30 genes, Table S5). A cell
line-speciﬁc gene set was determined for each breast
cancer cell line. To identify cancer-related genes, we
selected from a comprehensive list of potential breast
cancer diagnostic markers (http://www.sabiosciences.
com/gene_array_product/HTML/OHS-402.html). Genes
in this group are highly associated with breast cancer
(29). Functional groupings used in our study include:
cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, ECM molecules,

protein kinases, and transcription factors/regulators
(Table S6). To identify house-keeping genes, we selected
the 30 most highly expressed house-keeping genes as
deﬁned in a previous report (30). This list includes
ribosomal proteins, actin, ubiquitin, and others
(Table S7). In all cases, gene sequences were compiled
and analyzed for codon content at http://www
.bioinformatics.org/sms2/.
For each gene set, we compiled gene sequences and
analyzed them for codon usage (expressed as number
per one thousand codons, www.bioinformatics.org/sms2)
(Tables S8 and S9). Because certain tRNAs read
more than one codon, we converted the obtained codon
usage into tRNA-based codon usage. For example,
tRNAArg(ICG) reads both CGU and CGC. Its tRNA-
based codon usage is therefore equal to the sum of the
CGU and CGC codon usages. For simplicity, we refer
to tRNA-based codon usage as codon usage throughout
our analysis.
We ﬁrst compared the codon usages of each gene set in
the three gene groups (cell line-speciﬁc, cancer-related, and
house-keeping) against each other (Figure 6B). Though
there is limited overlap across cell line-speciﬁc gene sets,
their codon usage was remarkably similar (average
rs=0.92±0.04). The codon usage of cell-line speciﬁc
gene sets also correlates with the codon usage of the
house-keeping genes (average rs=0.80±0.08), but to a
signiﬁcantly lesser extent (P< 0.01). Similarly, the codon

standard deviation from the mean. (C) Association of relative tRNA levels to ratios of codon usage between cancer-related and house-keeping genes.

relative arginine tRNA isoacceptor levels to the arginine codon frequency of cancer-related genes.

usages of cancer-related gene sets correlate remarkably
well with each other (average rs=0.92±0.05) but
to a lesser extent with the house-keeping genes (aver-
age rs=0.83±0.06, P< 0.01). These results suggest
diﬀerent gene groups have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent codon
usages.
Is the codon usage of cell-line speciﬁc genes related to
the over-expression patterns of nuclear-encoded tRNAs in
breast cancer cells? We plotted relative isoacceptor levels
(derived from comparative tRNA measurements) versus
the codon frequency of cell-line speciﬁc genes (derived
from comparative mRNA analysis) to determine
whether the changes in tRNA levels favor the codon
usage of these genes. No obvious associations were
observed (not shown). The absence of associations may
be explained by the low mRNA level of these genes at
the global scale (Figure 6A). The cell line-speciﬁc genes
identiﬁed for this study are expressed only 7- to 15-fold
above the median expression level of all genes, compared
to 80-fold above median for the house-keeping genes.
Among human tissues examined, a signiﬁcant tRNA
abundance-codon usage association was found only in
liver (17). The mRNA levels of liver-speciﬁc genes
approach those of house-keeping genes (200-fold above
median), suﬃciently high for tRNAs to adjust to their
respective codon usages. Because the codon usage of
line-speciﬁc genes is diﬀerent from that of house-keeping
genes, adjusting tRNA levels to favor expression of cell
line-speciﬁc genes would be unfavorable for translation of
house-keeping genes.
The codon usage of cancer-related genes, however,
appears to have a positive association with the relative
tRNA over-expression in breast cancer cell lines (Figure
6C–E). Since the tRNA over-expression pattern is similar
for the nuclear-encoded tRNAs across all lines examined,
we used the average tRNA over-expression for all six
cancer lines for this analysis. Bearing in mind that
tRNA over-expression cannot favor all codons of
cancer-related genes because such tRNA adjustment
would diminish the translational eﬃciency of house-
keeping genes, we reasoned that a positive association
should reveal itself only for codons that are strongly
over-represented in cancer-related relative to house-
keeping genes. A positive association between tRNA
over-expression and codon usage is indeed observed for
codons over-represented by 2-fold or more for the cell
cycle, extracellular matrix, and transcription factor
groups (Figure 6C). Among the group of 28 cell cycle
genes ranked by their average mRNA expression levels
in all lines, a similar relationship can be seen when
comparing the codons that are over-represented in the
nine genes with the highest mRNA expression versus the
nine genes with the lowest mRNA expression (Figure 6D).
Finally, tRNAArg isoacceptors seem to be particularly
tuned to increase the translational eﬃciency of Arg-
codons of the cell cycle, extracellular matrix and trans-
cription factor genes (Figure 6E). Consistent with this
observation, two of the ﬁve tRNAArg isoacceptors are
among the highest over-expressed tRNAs in cancer cells
(Figure 2E).
DISCUSSION
tRNA over-expression in breast cancer cells
Consistent with previous reports on individual tRNAs,
our genome-wide results show that elevated tRNA levels
are characteristic of all breast cancer cells analyzed. To
our knowledge, however, our study is the ﬁrst to analyze
expression levels for all tRNAs in cancerous versus non-
cancerous cells. Our results reveal an unexpected selectiv-
ity in the over-expression of individual tRNA species,
based on cognate amino acid properties and isoacceptor
identities. Each breast cancer cell line generates tRNA
proﬁles that are markedly diﬀerent from that of non-
cancer-derived breast epithelial cell lines. These obser-
vations hold true for breast tumor samples compared to
normal breast tissue. However, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in tRNA expression patterns across the three
major subtypes of breast cancer we examined. The small
sample size used in this study is likely insuﬃcient to reveal
subtle but signiﬁcant diﬀerences between breast cancer
subtypes. Also, tRNA expression at diﬀerent tumor
stages remains to be examined. Overall, our results high-
light the potential of using both nuclear- and
mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs as biomarkers for malig-
nancy, tumor type, or tumor progression.
Remarkably, tRNAs carrying the amino acids serine,
threonine, and tyrosine are among the most over-
expressed across all breast cancer cell lines and breast
tumors analyzed. Since these amino acid residues are
targets for protein kinases and phosphatases, this result
suggests these tRNAs might be part of a potential mech-
anism for potentiating post-translational regulation of
proteins involved in signal transduction. How such a
mechanism may work remains obscure at this time.
Furthermore, signiﬁcant diﬀerences are observed in the
relative expression levels of tRNA isoacceptors.
Diﬀerential expression of tRNA isoacceptors may
provide an additional level of translational regulation
for key genes involved in tumorigenesis. Tumors display
both quantitative and qualitative changes in protein
expression, with preferential translation of growth
factors, cell-cycle promoters, and proto-oncogenes, such
as VEGF, cyclin D1, and c-Myc (2). It is possible that
selective over-expression of tRNA isoacceptors enhances
translational eﬃciency of some of these genes.
Another mechanism linking translational control by
tRNA and oncogenic transformation has recently been
reported (9). In that work, the translation initiator
tRNAMeti was shown to have oncogenic capacity. A
modest over-expression of initiator tRNAMeti (<2-fold)
results in malignant transformation of immortalized
mouse ﬁbroblasts, whereas over-expression of the
elongator tRNAMete to a similar level does not.
Consistent with these observations, our results indicate
that tRNAMeti is also over-expressed by 2- to 3-fold in
all cancer-derived versus non-cancer-derived breast cell
lines. However, over-expression of tRNAMeti is below
that of other tRNAs such as the Ser/Thr/Tyr-tRNAs in
the breast cancer cells. Over-expression of these tRNAs
may simply be the consequence of over-expression of
tRNAMeti , although a more exciting possibility is that
7278 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 21
some of these tRNAs also have oncogenic potential and
may be regulated independently. Further studies are
needed to elucidate the regulatory relationships between
tRNA expression and cancer.
Variations of tRNA–codon usage associations
A main regulatory function of tRNA is to tune the trans-
lation eﬃciency of individual mRNAs via their codon
usages (10). A common hypothesis is that during active
cell growth, the amount of tRNA isoacceptors correlates
with the codon usage of genes translated at high levels.
This hypothesis has been validated for bacteria and yeast
(26–28). In mammalian cells, this hypothesis also holds for
isolated instances where tRNA amounts have been
measured in specialized cells, e.g. red blood cells (31).
The common analysis of tRNA-codon usage correla-
tion/association relies on knowing the amount of tRNA
isoacceptors in each sample. Information on absolute
tRNA abundance levels, however, is diﬃcult to obtain in
microarray measurements due to variations in labeling
and hybridization eﬃciencies. Therefore, a direct assess-
ment of tRNA-codon usage association in breast cancer
cells cannot be carried out in this study.
Instead, the array results compare the relative abun-
dance of each isoacceptor between two samples. Among
the three groups of genes relevant for codon usage-tRNA
over-expression association analysis, positive associations
are found only for certain codons among cancer-related
genes. Our results suggest that during active cell growth
(as examined in this work), a complete adjustment of
tRNA abundance to ﬁt the codon usage of regulatory
genes would be very diﬃcult. tRNAs in the same cell
must balance promoting translation of regulatory genes
versus demoting translation of house-keeping genes with
diﬀerent codon usage. From the codon usage perspective,
tRNA over-expression can only beneﬁt the translation of
a subset of regulatory genes or a subset of codons in the
regulatory genes. Thus, over-expression of tRNA in breast
cancer cells likely aﬀects other regulatory processes that
are yet to be explored or understood.
