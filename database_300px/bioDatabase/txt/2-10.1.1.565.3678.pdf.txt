[1] The heat input to Martian dust devils due to solar
warming of suspended particles is assessed based on a prior
estimate of dust loading and from an analysis of shadows cast
by dust devils in images taken from orbit. Estimated values
for solar heating range from 0.12 to 0.57 W/m3 with
associated temperature increases of 0.011 to 0.051C per
second. These warming rates are comparable to the adiabatic
cooling rate expected for a gas parcel rising on Mars with a
vertical velocity of 10 m/s. Solar warming of suspended dust
serves to maintain buoyancy in a rising dust plume and may
be one cause for the large scale of dust devils observed on
Mars. Citation: Fuerstenau, S. D. (2006), Solar heating of

1. Introduction
[2] Since the discovery of dust devils, rotating columns of
unstable air, on Mars [Ryan and Lucich, 1983; Thomas and
Gierasch, 1985] significant effort has been directed at under-
standing the formation and dynamics of these atmospheric
vortices. Of particular interest are explanations for the rela-
tively high numbers of dust devils in certain regions on the
Martian surface and the enormous size of some of these dust
columns relative to their terrestrial counterparts. The interest
in Martian dust devils has lead to recent models of the vortex
fluid dynamics [Renno, 1998] and the meso-scale environ-
ments [Toigo et al., 2003] in which they occur. Scaling
arguments based on low-density flow analysis suggest that
boundary layers on Mars in general should be larger than
comparable flow features on Earth [Greeley and Iverson,
1985]. Similarly, the Grashof number used to compare the
dynamics of freely convecting systems, indicates that a
characteristic dimension for a thermally buoyant plume in
the 1% atmospheric density on Mars would be about twenty
times that for a plume under the same temperature gradient
driving force on Earth [Traugott and Yamamura, 1975].
Another aspect of the low density atmosphere on Mars is a
greatly reduced heat capacity in comparison to Earth’s atmo-
sphere. The following observations suggest that the effect of a
low heat capacity on dust devil dynamics can be significant
and may provide a possible explanation for the prevalence
and large scale of Martian dust devils.
2. Solar Heating of Suspended Dust Particles
[3] The environments in which dust devils occur on Earth
and Mars are similar except for the density of the atmo-
sphere. The relevant temperature range on Mars is 225 K–
290 K and on Earth, 280–320 K. The solar intensity at the
surface during which dust devils can form ranges from 300
to 500 W/m2 on Mars and roughly 900–1100 W/m2 on
Earth. The gravitational field on Mars is 0.38 g. The density
of the Martian atmosphere (0.013 kg/m3) however, is just
1% of that on Earth (1.22 kg/m3). Somewhat surprising is
the fact that despite its low density, the atmosphere of Mars
is just as able to support suspended dust particles as our own
atmosphere. This capability to suspend dust is illustrated in
Figure 1, a plot of settling velocity vs. particle size for Earth
and Mars. As the plot illustrates particles with diameters
ranging between 10 mm and 300 mm will fall at the same rate
on Mars as they do on Earth. This comparison was
previously made by Murphy et al. [1990], but it warrants
emphasis here because this behavior of particles in low
density atmospheres is perhaps not a very intuitive one.
Particles smaller than 10 mm will fall faster on Mars due to
the larger mean free path of the gas. Similarly, larger bodies
(d > 300 mm) on Mars will fall at roughly ten times the
velocity that they would on Earth because their profile drag
is proportional to ru2, where r is the gas density and u is the
velocity. However, in the intermediate size range the drag
experienced by a spherical particle is determined according
to the viscous flow, or ‘Stokes’, regime. In this regime the
drag force F resisting that of gravity is given by:
F ¼ Cd ru2=2 A ¼ mpg ð1Þ
Cd ¼ 24=Re ¼ 24m=ru Dp ð2Þ
where A is the particle cross sectional area, Re is the
Reynolds number, m is the gas viscosity, and Dp and mp are
the particle diameter and mass. When equation 2 is
substituted for Cd in equation 1, r cancels out, and the
expression for the particle drag is independent of gas
density. Therefore, in the Stokes regime, the only aspect of
the atmosphere influencing particle drag is viscosity, a
property that is independent of pressure and that varies in
proportion to the square root of the gas temperature.
Because the low density atmosphere of Mars exhibits, to
first order, the same viscosity as Earth’s atmosphere,
particles over a wide range of sizes settle at the same rate.
The mechanism by which particles become suspended due
the action of wind, however, is highly dependent on the
atmospheric density for reasons first pointed out by Bagnold
over 50 years ago [Bagnold, 1941], and much progress has
been made in furthering understanding of this mechanism
since then [Greeley et al., 1980]. Nevertheless, without
stating anything about suspension mechanisms, one can
conclude that Martian dust devils have the possibility of

carrying dust loads comparable to their terrestrial counter-
parts. Preliminary measurements by Metzger et al. [1999]
have found this indeed to be the case.
[4] When sunlight falls on a cloud of suspended dust, a
fraction of that radiant energy is absorbed by particles,
which in turn quickly transfer the additional heat to the
surrounding gas, warming it. The effect was recently
postulated by Lorenz who attempted to observe it in
terrestrial dust devils [Lorenz, 2004]. In the hypothetical
case of two clouds of equal dust concentration with roughly
equal levels of sunlight impinging on them, one on Mars
and one on Earth, the amount of absorbed energy will be
comparable in both cases. In the case of the cloud in the 1%
atmosphere of Mars, however, the resulting temperature rise
DT in the surrounding gas will be 100 times greater than for
the same dust cloud on Earth. Therefore, what is a small
degree of temperature rise due to solar warming in terrestrial
dust clouds could be very substantial on Mars. To state it
another way, the heat capacity of the gas contained in a
Martian dust devil is a hundred times smaller (due to the 1%
density) than that in a terrestrial dust devil, resulting in a
relative hundred-fold larger temperature rise for the same
heat input.
[5] Solar heating of Mars’ thin atmosphere due to sus-
pended dust has been extensively modeled over the past 3
decades starting with the work of Gierasch and Goody
[1972], and temperature increases of 50C have been
measured for the upper Martian atmosphere during dust
storm events on Mars [Zurek et al., 1992]. Such temperature
increases in the Martian atmosphere, both in models and
observation, take place over time scales of one day. In
contrast, the residence time of the gas in a rising dust devil
plume is only 1 to 5 minutes; a duration seemingly too short
for any appreciable solar warming to take place. However,
when one considers that dust loading in a Martian dust devil
can be three or four orders of magnitude greater than in the
surrounding atmosphere, the possibility of rapid warming
from sunlight becomes more plausible. Metzger and co-
workers concluded that a 10 meter wide dust devil captured
by the Mars Pathfinder camera contained 7  105 kg of
dust per cubic meter while the background atmospheric dust
content was estimated to be 9  109 kg per cubic meter
[Metzger et al., 1999].
[6] An estimate of the solar heating in the Martian dust
devil described by Metzger et al. [1999] can be made with
assumptions about the dust particle size and absorption
properties. By analyzing images of the sun taken from the
surface of Mars, Tomasko et al. [1999] estimated that the
mean diameter of suspended particles is 3 micrometers.
Data from the same study, integrated over the visible solar
spectrum, indicates that 11% of the incident energy is
absorbed by dust particles, and 89% is scattered. Multiply-
ing the cross sectional area of a 3 micrometer particle (7 
1012 m2) by the number of particles (1.7  109) in a cubic
meter containing 7  105 kg of mineral dust (density
3 g/cc) yields an estimated total cross sectional area of
0.012 m2 per cubic meter. Taking 430 W/m2 as the
irradiance from the afternoon sun on Mars one estimates
that 5.2 watts of energy impinges on the dust in that cubic
meter. Of this intercepted energy, 11% or 0.57 watts, is
absorbed and converted into heat. Warm dust grains quickly
transfer excess heat to the surrounding gas maintaining local
thermal equilibrium. The heat capacity of CO2 is
860 J/kg-K and the density of the Martian atmosphere at
7 mBar and 270 K is 0.013 kg/m3. Using these values one
may calculate that warming a cubic meter of Martian
atmosphere with 0.57 watts will raise its temperature by
0.051C per second. If the volume of gas were carried aloft
in a dust devil with a vertical speed of 20 m/s it would warm
by 2.6C in the time it would take to reach an altitude of
1 km. If the dust column were rising at 10 m/s, the effective
temperature rise at 1 km would be 5.2C.
3. Analysis of Martian Dust Devil Shadows
[7] A more direct estimate of the solar radiation absorbed
within a dust devil plume may be obtained by analyzing the
depth of shadows cast by dust devils as observed from orbit.
Light levels within the dust devil shadow and non-
shadowed regions of such images provide a measure of
the sunlight blocked by the dust column. The fraction of
sunlight that is ‘missing’ from the dust devil’s shadow
provides a good estimate of the energy scattered and
absorbed by particles within the column. In addition, the
dimensions of the shadow and bright plume provide a rough
measure of the height and volume of the column within
which the absorbed fraction of the blocked sunlight is
converted to heat. The analysis requires consideration of
the indirect sunlight, (i.e. light scattered by the surrounding
dusty atmosphere) as well as direct sunlight as is illustrated
in the following example of this approach.
[8] One of several images of dust devils captured by
Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) aboard MGS is depicted in
Figure 2. This particular image (MGS MOC Release No.
MOC2-1231, 25 September 2005) is useful because it
contains both a shadow of arbitrary magnitude cast by a
dust devil, and darker shadows caused by terrain whose
depth indicate the intensity of the indirect sunlight. A study
of the photograph with image analysis software (Scion
Image, Scion Corporation, release 4.0.1) yields the
following relative light intensities on a scale from 0 to

second) as a function of particle diameter (micrometers) on

255. Average intensities for deep terrain shadows and sunlit
plain are 36 and 113 respectively. These values are consistent
with a relatively dust freeMartian atmosphere (optical density
0.5) previously estimated to have a roughly 2 to 1 ratio of
direct to indirect illumination [Landis et al., 2004]. Assuming
a noon time flux of 440W/m2 and correcting by the cosine of
the incident angle of the sun at the time the image was taken
(34.9), the flux of direct sunlight to the surface in this image
is estimated at 360 W/m2.
[9] The relative intensity of the light in the dust devil
shadow is 66. The indirect component of the illumination
can be isolated from the dust devil shadow region and the
surrounding plain by subtracting 36, the average intensity
measured in terrain shadows, to yield direct illumination
components for the shadow and plain region of 30 and 77
respectively. When the direct illumination components are
thus compared one may conclude that only 39% (30/77) of
the direct sunlight penetrates the dust cloud. In other words
61% of the direct sunlight, an effective 220 W/m2, is
‘missing’ from the shadow. The shadow appears to cover
17,400 square meters and hence an estimated 3.8 million J
(17,400 m2  360 W/m2) of energy is intercepted by the
suspended dust each second. If we assume that 11% of this
energy is absorbed by the particles and converted to heat
that is transferred to the gas in the column, then direct
sunlight pumps 4.2  105 Watts of heat into the dust devil.
The 200 meter height of the plume is calculated by dividing
the length of the shadow (140 meters) by Tan (34.9). If the
dust devil plume has a width of 150 meters then the volume
of the cylindrical plume is estimated to be 3.5  106 cubic
meters. Thus on average, each cubic meter of this dust devil
is warmed by 0.12 Joules of heat per second. Dividing this
value by 0.013 kg/m3 and the gas heat capacity
(860 J/kg-K) yields the result that the atmosphere inside
the dust column is warmed by 0.011C per second. If the
warming due to indirect sunlight scattered from the particles
in the surrounding atmosphere is taken into account, this
estimate for the heating rate could increase by an additional
50% or more.
[10] Solar warming of suspended dust works to maintain
buoyancy in the rising dust column by reducing, or even
reversing, the cooling that occurs through adiabatic expan-
sion. The principle is illustrated in Figure 3 which is a plot
of gas temperature as a function of altitude. Because
atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, rising parcels
of air undergo expansion and thereby cool. This rate of
temperature decrease as a function of altitude is termed the
dry adiabatic lapse rate and is a thermodynamic property of
the atmosphere determined by composition, density, and
gravitational field. On Mars the dry adiabatic lapse rate is
4.5C/km [http//:pds.atmospheres.nmsu.edu]. The actual
temperature variation with altitude, or the true lapse rate,
has been determined with measurements from the Mars
Global Surveyor orbiter and the Opportunity Mars Explo-
ration Rover from the surface [Smith et al., 2004]. Data
representing the temperature profile above the Opportunity
rover at 13:30 local time on sol 22 is plotted as curve ‘‘A’’ in
Figure 3, while the adiabatic lapse 4.5C/km rate is indi-
cated as line ‘‘B’’. Without solar warming from suspended
particles, gas inside a dust devil will rise until its temper-
ature drops, through adiabatic cooling, to that of the
surrounding atmosphere. At this point the gas inside the
plume will no longer be buoyant and will cease climbing
[Barcilon, 1967]. Solar warming of suspended dust will
cause the gas inside the column to cool at a slower rate. If a
warm gas plume rises at 10 m/s the temperature drop due to
adiabatic cooling will be 0.045C per second. Subtracting
from this value the rate of solar warming calculated for the
dust loading cases above yields an effective cooling rate for
the rising gas inside the dust devils. Case ‘‘C’’ in Figure 3
represents the effective cooling rate (0.045–0.011C/s)
calculated from the shadow of the 25 September 2005 dust
devil assuming a vertical rise rate of 10 m/s. Cases ‘‘D’’ and
‘‘E’’ are for gas parcels with the 7  105 kg/m3 dust
loading estimated by Metzger et al. assuming vertical

velocities of 20 m/s (0.045–0.026C/s) and 10 m/s (0.045–
0.052C/s) respectively.
4. Conclusion
[11] The above analysis does not address several aspects of
the problem including the fact that the adsorption will not be
uniform throughout a dust column if it has a high opacity. In
high opacity dust devils solar warming would be expected to
occur primarily at the edges of the plume as has been observed
for larger dust storms on Mars [Newman, 2001]. What the
analysis does indicate is that solar warming of suspended
particles in Martian dust devils will lead to a heat input of a
magnitude that is on the order of cooling from adiabatic
expansion. The added buoyancy from this effect may provide
one explanation for the large size and prevalence of Martian
dust devils. The phenomenon is a major component of the
thermodynamics governing dust devils on Mars and should
be accounted for in local and meso-scale models.
