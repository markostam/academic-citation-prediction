ABSTRACT
Circular dichroism (CD) and UV-melting experiments
were conducted with 16 oligodeoxynucleotides
modified by the carcinogen 2-aminofluorene, whose
sequence around the lesion was varied systemati-
cally [d(CTTCTNG[AF]NCCTC), N ¼ G, A, C, T], to
gain insight into the factors that determine the
equilibrium between base-displaced stacked (S) and
external B-type (B) duplex conformers. Differing
stabilities among the duplexes can be attributed to
different populations of S and B conformers. The
AF modification always resulted in sequence-
dependent thermal (Tm) and thermodynamic (DG)
destabilization. The population of B-type conformers
derived from eight selected duplexes (i.e. -AG*N- and -
CG*N-) was inversely proportional to theDG and Tm
values, which highlights the importance of carcino-
gen/base stacking in duplex stabilization even in the
face of disrupted Watson–Crick base pairing in
S-conformation. CD studies showed that the extent
of the adduct-induced negative ellipticities in the
290–350 nm range is correlated linearly with DG
and Tm, but inversely with the population of B-
type conformations. Taken together, these results
revealed a unique interplay between the extent
of carcinogenic interaction with neighboring base
pairs and the thermodynamic properties of the
AF-modified duplexes. The sequence-dependent
S/B heterogeneities have important implications in
understanding how arylamine–DNA adducts are
recognized in nucleotide excision repair.
INTRODUCTION
Arylamines and their derivatives are an important class of
carcinogens (1). N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene is a strong liver
carcinogen that has been studied extensively as a prototype
arylamine carcinogen. Upon activation in vivo, it reacts with
cellular DNA to produce two C8-substituted acetylamino-
fluorene (AAF) and aminofluorene (AF) adducts (Figure 1),
along with a small amount of N2-substituted adduct (2). The
two major adducts are rapidly excised by nucleotide excis-
ion repair (NER), whereas the minor dG-N2 adduct persists in
mammalian cells (3–5). Translesion synthesis of AF-adducts is
achieved with high-fidelity polymerases, whereas replication
of AAF-adducts requires specialized bypass polymerases (6).
An X-ray study by Hsu et al. (7) has shown that accurate
nucleotide incorporation is feasible opposite the AF-lesion
in the active site of a large DNA polymerase I Bacillus
fragment, but not opposite the AAF-adduct which blocks
nucleotide incorporation. Although incorporation opposite
AF occurs, the translesion synthesis is slowed due to distor-
tions in the polymerase active site induced by the C:G[AF]
base pair. The crystal structures of the AAF and AF-adducts
complexed with T7 DNA polymerase yielded similar findings
(8). Specifically, they observed weak binding of the AF-adduct
to the polymerase and, interestingly, found evidence suggest-
ing that there may be syn–anti glycosidyl conformational
heterogeneity within the active site.
Distinctly different mutagenic and repair properties of AAF
and AF adducts have been observed. In bacteria, AAF yields
primarily frameshift mutations, whereas the deacetylated AF
produces a mixture of frameshift and point mutations (1). In
mammalian cells, however, point mutations are predominant
for both adducts, although AAF is associated primarily with
deletion mutations in certain sequences (9,10). Zou et al. (11)
have shown that the Escherichia coli NER process takes place

in a sequential two-step mechanism, i.e. disruption of the
Watson–Crick DNA structure is recognized initially, while
the type of modification of the nucleotide is important in a
subsequent step upon a strand opening. Both the AAF and AF
adducts were equally incised when placed in a single strand,
indicating they were equally recognized in the second step and
discriminated only during the initial recognition. The muta-
tional and repair efficiencies of these adducts depend strongly
on the identities of the neighboring bases surrounding the
lesion site (9,12). Such sequence effects are likely to be related
to adduct-induced conformational heterogeneities in DNA as
well as the unique structural features of specific proteins
(3,13). Bulky DNA adducts often adopt multiple conforma-
tions, which can interconvert mutagenic and non-mutagenic
within the active site of replication or repair enzymes (14,15).
Duplexes containing AF-adducts exist principally as a mixture
of two structurally distinct conformations: an ‘external binding
B-type (B)’ conformer and a ‘base-displaced stacked (S)’ con-
former (Figure 1) depending on the nature of (anti and syn,
respectively) the glycosidyl conformation of the modified dG
(15,16). The sequence dependence of the AF-induced S/B-
conformational heterogeneity has been well documented for
various base sequences that include duplexes, template/primer
junction and bulges (15,16).
The structure of duplex DNA influences repair mechanisms.
Elucidating the structural and conformation characteristics of
carcinogen-modified DNA duplexes is a crucial step towards
understanding the mechanisms of DNA repair (3,11,12,17,18).
We therefore initiated a systematic study to investigate
the sequence-dependent conformational heterogeneity in
AF-mutagenesis. In this paper, a complete set of 16 AF-
modified 12mer oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), in which
the lesion was flanked systematically by all possible trimer
sequence combinations [d(CTTCTNG*NCCTC), G* ¼ AF
adduct, N ¼ G, A, C, T, Table 1], was prepared and then
annealed with the appropriate sequences to produce fully com-
plementary heteroduplexes for circular dichroism (CD) and
UV-melting experiments. In addition, we obtained 19F NMR
spectra of eight selected duplexes (i.e. the -AG*N- and
-CG*N- series, sequences 5–12) modified by the fluorine
probe 7-fluoro-2-aminofluorene (19,20) in order to determine
their S/B population ratios. The systematic sequence variation
around the AF-modified guanine enabled us to probe how
flanking sequences influence the nature of the base pair
interactions at or near the adduct site, and ultimately the
S/B-conformational heterogeneities. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first thermodynamic and spectroscopic study
on the sequence-dependent conformational heterogeneity of
AF-modified oligonucleotides.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ODNs were purchased in desalted forms from Sigma-Genosys
(The Woodlands, TX). Chemical reagents and enzymes such
as DNase I, phosphodiesterase I and alkaline phosphatase
were all obtained from Sigma Chemical (Milwaukee, WI).
Both 30- and 50-phosphodiesterases used in the mass
spectrometry digestion experiments were purchased from
Worthington Biochemical (Lakewood, NJ). All high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) solvents were
purchased from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA).
All AF-modified 12mer ODNs were prepared and char-
acterized according to the literature procedures (21,22). The
general base sequence employed in this study (Table 1) was a
truncated portion of a mouse ras protoononcogene, which
has been used in our earlier 1H (23,24) and 19F NMR (19,20)
studies. The synthesis, HPLC purification and enzyme-digest/
LC/MS characterization of the modified ODNs are detailed
in Supplementary Figures S1–S4.
Optical melting experiments
UV-melting curves were measured using a Beckman DU
800 UV/VIS spectrophotometer equipped with a 6-chamber,
1 cm path length Tm cell. Sample cell temperatures were
controlled by a built-in Peltier temperature controller.
Duplex solutions with a total concentration in the range of
0.2–14 mM were prepared in solutions containing 0.2 M NaCl,
10 mM sodium phosphate and 0.2 mM EDTA at pH 7.0.
The concentration of each ODN sample was estimated
based on UV absorbance at a wavelength of 260 nm (25).
Melting curves were constructed by varying the temperature
of the sample cell (1C/min) and monitoring the absorbance
of the sample at 260 nm. A typical melting experiment con-
sisted of two forward and two reverse scans and was repeated
three times.
Thermodynamic parameters for bimolecular melting
reactions of the duplexes were obtained from melting curve
data using the program MELTWIN version 3.5 (25). Two

fluorene). (B) Two prototype AF-induced conformations: an external binding
B-type (B) conformer and a base-displaced stacked (S) conformer. The hydro-
phobic AF moiety is shown in CPK. The modified dG in the B-conformer
maintains a Watson–Crick base pairing with the AF moiety protruding in
the major groove, whereas the S-conformer adopts a base-displacement
structure with the AF ring inserted into the helix. The duplex structures of
sequence 5 were constructed with the literature protocols (16) and shown here
for illustration purpose only.

different methods (25–27) were used to calculate the enthalpy
(DH) and entropy (DS) of the helix-coil equilibrium: (i) fits
of individual curves and (ii) van’t Hoff plots of Tm
1 versus lnCt
to fit to Tm
1 ¼ R/DH lnCt/4 + DS/DH (Supplementary Fig-
ure S5), in which Tm is a melting transition point in K, Ct is a
total duplex concentration, and R is the universal gas constant
(1.987 cal/K-mol); DG ¼ DH  TDS (25,27). Thermodyn-
amic data derived from van’t Hoff plots have been shown to be
more reliable than those from fits of curves for non-two-state
transitions involving DNA hairpins or slipped duplexes (27).
The margins of the parameters derived from the curve fit data
and from Tm
1  lnCt plots in the present study were found to
be within ±15%. This close agreement indicates the presence
of strictly bimolecular transitions, in which case the data
obtained from the two methods are equally reliable (25,28).
Table 1 lists the average values of the energetics of thermal
transition, enthalpy and free energy change for the duplexes in
this study.
Circular dichroism experiments
CD measurements were conducted on a Jasco J-810 spectropo-
larimeter equipped with a variable Peltier temperature
controller. All CD experiments were conducted at 15C.
Typically, 2 ods of a duplex sample were dissolved in
400 ml of a buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium
phosphate, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, and placed in a 1 mm path
length cell. The sample was heated at 85C for 5 min and then
cooled to 15C over a 10 min period. The spectropolarimeter
was scanned from 200 to 400 nm at a rate of 50 nm/min. Data
points were acquired every 0.2 nm with a 2 s response time.
Spectra were the averages of 10 accumulations and smoothed
using a 17 point adaptive smoothing algorithm.
19F NMR experiments
According to the reported procedure (19), preliminary
19F NMR measurements were conducted for eight selected
duplexes (sequences 5–12) modified by the ‘fluorine reporter
probe’, 7-fluoro-2-aminofluorene. The modified ODNs were
purified and characterized similarly as described for the
non-fluorinated AF-duplexes (Supplementary Data). Approxi-
mately 80–100 ods of pure modified ODNs were annealed
with appropriate sequences to form fully complementary
heteroduplexes and centrifuged through a Millipore Centricon
YM-3 centrifugal filter (Yellow, molecular weight cutoff ¼
3000). The filtered samples were dissolved in a pH 7.0 buffer
(10% D2O/90% H2O) containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM
sodium phosphate and 100 mM tetrasodium EDTA. Proton-
decoupled 19F NMR spectra were obtained using a dedicated
19F/1H dual probe on a Bruker DPX400 Avance spectrometer
operating at 376.5 MHz and referenced to CFCl3 by assigning
external hexafluorobenzene in C6D6 at164.90 p.p.m. Spectra
exhibited two prominent signals with varying intensities in the
117 to 120 p.p.m. region. Signal assignments have been
made by analyses of dynamic NOESY/exchange and H/D
solvent isotope data using the protocols described previously
(19). The S/B population ratios were obtained by area inte-
gration at 20C and the results are shown in Table 1. Full

RESULTS
Enzyme-LC/MS characterization
The electrospray-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis
of each AF-modified ODN was carried out to determine the
number and the positions of the AF modifications. Molecular
ion spectra did not show any singly charged molecular ions,
but rather exhibited the expected multiple charged ions upon
electrospray with triply charged species as base peaks. The
results of molecular ion spectra of all 16 AF-modified
sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Each of the ODNs that contained more than one guanine
(i.e. sequences 1–5, 9 and 13) was sequenced using the exonu-
clease strategies similar to those described previously for
identifying the position of bases modified by arylamines
(29–31). The exonucleases hydrolyze the phosphodiester
bonds of the terminal nucleotides sequentially from either
the 50 end (50–30 exonuclease) or 30 end (30–50 exonuclease)
to give 30- and 50-monodeoxynucleotides, respectively. The
digestion rate with either exonuclease slowed significantly
when a modified guanine base is exposed at the terminus.
The details of enzyme-digest/LC/MS characterization are
described in Supplementary Data using sequence 13 as an
example.
Thermomelting studies
Unmodified control duplexes exhibited melting profiles that
were characteristic of a monophasic, sigmoidal, helix-coil
transition. Despite the demonstrated conformational hetero-
geneity, a strong linear association (R2 > 0.974) between
Tm
1 and lnCt was observed for all 16 AF-modified duplexes
over the 0.2–14 mM concentration range (Supplementary
Figure S5). In the present study, the contribution of changes
in heat capacity (DCp ¼ dDH/dT) was assumed to be negli-
gible. This assumption is valid because, while DCp is consid-
ered to be an important factor in analysis of duplex folding, the
error associated with neglecting it is important only at lower
temperatures (32).
Tm is defined as a midpoint of sigmoidal melting curves.
DTm is the difference in Tm values between the modified and
the control duplex and this shift represents the adduct-induced
thermal destabilization. As shown in Table 1, AF modifica-
tion consistently lowers Tm. Tm in both control and modified
sequences increases with increasing % G:C content at the sites
flanking the lesion (12). In this study, the Tm values of those
sequences that had only A:T flanking base pairs (sequences 6,
8, 14 and 16) ranged from 43.9 to 55.8C for the control and
from 39.1 to 47.2C for the modified duplexes. An unusually
lower Tm value (39.1
C) was obtained for AF-modified
sequence 16 (-TG*T-), in which the lesion was flanked by
two T:A base pairs. This exceptionally low Tm value differed
markedly from the moderately high Tm value of 46.1
C
observed for sequence 6 (-AG*A-). The contrast between
the Tm values of sequences 16 and 6 illustrates the great impact
that base polarity, e.g. A:T versus T:A, can have on thermal
stability. The Tm values for sequences with G:C base pairs on
both sides of the lesion (sequences 1, 3, 9 and 11) were in the
range of 62.3–64.4C and 51.2–54.0C for the control and
modified duplexes, respectively. The narrow ranges of these
values indicate that the base polarity effect for AF-lesions
flanked by G:C base pairs is relatively minor. For example,
the Tm difference between AF-modified sequences 1 (-GG*G-)
and 11 (-CG*C-) was only 2.8C. The remaining sequences,
which contain one A:T and one G:C base pair, exhibited inter-
mediate Tm ranges: 53.3–59.8
C and 41.9–54.0C, for the
control and modified duplexes, respectively.
The effects of 50- and 30-flanking bases on Tm and DG
were examined and are tabulated in Supplementary Tables S2
and S3. The thermostability of AF-modified duplexes always
increased when a 50 lesion-flanking A was replaced by a
50 flanking G (by 3.3–6.9C) and when a 50 lesion-flanking
T was replaced by a 50 flanking C (by 1.8–10.7C). The effect
of the 50-T to 50-C transition was especially pronounced when
the lesion was flanked with a G or T (sequence 16!12,
sequence 13!9). The 30-effect was essentially similar except
for a transition from -TG*A- (sequence 14) to -TG*G-
(sequence 13), which increased Tm significantly (5.3
C).
The temperature shift ranges of Tm were 3.6–4.6
C and
1.6–3.7C for the 30-A!G and 30-T!C transitions, respec-
tively. Again, the greatest effect (9.9C) involved sequence
16 [16!15 (-TG*T- to -TG*C-)]. Note that similar 50- and
30-trends were observed for the unmodified duplexes.
As in the case of Tm, DG of the AF-modified duplexes
increased with increasing % G:C content at the sites flanking
the adduct (Table 1). The DG values (6.8–8.8 kcal/mol)
observed for AF-modified sequences (6, 8, 14 and 16) with
only A:T flanking base pairs were lower than those with G:C
flanking base pairs only (sequences 1, 3, 9 and 11; 9.6–
10.7 kcal/mol). The effect of base polarity change, however,
was significant for those with A:T base pairs. For example,
DG decreased significantly going from -AG*A- (8.8 kcal/
mol; sequence 6) to -TG*T- (6.8 kcal/mol; sequence 16). The
remaining sequences, which contained one A:T and one G:C
base pair, exhibited a borderline DG (7.3–9.9 kcal/mol). As
in the case of Tm, the thermodynamic stabilities for the modi-
fied duplexes were always greater with a 50-G than with a 50-A
(by 0.6–1.5 kcal/mol) and with a 50-dC than with a 50-dT (by
0.7–3.4 kcal/mol). Similar differences (0.3–2.1 kcal/mol) were
observed when examining the effect of the 30 flanking base. An
exception was again the transition from sequence 14!13 in
which a 1.5 kcal/mol DG increase was found.
The consistent decrease in DG that arose from AF modi-
fication is indicative of a decrease in enthalpy, which implies
that there is a loss of base stacking and pairing near the lesion
site. The differences in transition free energy (DDG) for the
AF-modified duplexes were significantly smaller than the
observed differences in transition enthalpy change (DDH).
This may be due to enthalpy–entropy compensation effects,
which have been found to be a commonly occurring phen-
omenon in modified DNA duplexes (33,34). As expected, an
excellent linear correlation (R2 ¼ 0.884) was obtained
between DG and Tm (Supplementary Figure S6); however,
the DDG values did not seem to follow the same trend with
Tm (data not shown), suggesting that the identities of the bases
flanking the lesion influence DDG as well (35,36).

Circular dichroism spectra
The CD spectra of all the duplexes used in this study were
measured under low salt conditions (0.2 M NaCl, Supplemen-
tary Figure S7). CD spectra of unmodified and AF-modified
sequence 5 (-AG*G-) are shown in Figure 2 as an example.
The AF-modified single strand exhibited a positive CD band
centered at 275 nm and weak negative bands below 250 nm.
These CD bands became well organized upon duplex forma-
tion and exhibited unique adduct-induced negative ellipticities
in the 290–365 nm range (see below). The results are com-
pared with that of the unmodified control duplex and indicate
that both the control and the AF-modified duplexes adopt an
overall B-DNA conformation in solution (33,34,37).
Sequence-dependent CD bands in the 290–365 nm
range (CD/+)
The aforementioned adduct-induced CD bands were present
only in the modified duplexes and disappeared as the tempera-
ture was raised (Supplementary Figure S8). This phenomenon
has been observed previously for AF-modified DNA in limited
sequence settings at low to medium NaCl concentrations
(22,38–41). The single strand, AF-modified ODNs have
broad electronic absorptions in 300–350 nm (Supplementary
Figure S1A, inset); therefore, the induced CD must arise from
the interaction between the non-chiral AF moiety and the
chiral DNA (22).
Figure 3 shows overlays of the normalized AF-induced CD
bands generated by all of the 16 AF-modified duplexes in the
290–365 nm range. They are uniquely sequence-dependent
and can be grouped into two general categories depending
on their CD patterns: (i) sequences 2, 5–7, 9–11, which exhib-
ited a negative dip in 290–330 nm with varying intensities
of positive bump centered around 340 nm, forming an ‘S-
curved CD’ or (ii) sequences 1,3,4, 8, 12–16, which exhibited
broad negative ‘bucket-shaped CD’ in 290–350 nm. To
assess this interesting phenomenon quantitatively, an arbitrary
ratio of the negative area (trough) over the positive area
centered 275 nm in the range of 260–365 nm (designated
herein as CD+/) was determined to see how this ratio might
correlate with the S/B-conformer ratio. This was illustrated in
Figure 3C for sequences 16 and 6, which represent typical
‘bucket-shaped’ and ‘S-curved’ CDs, respectively. The nega-
tive and the positive area are color-coded as red and black,
respectively, for clarity. The plateau at 365 nm was used as a
baseline reference point. The small positive bumps around
340 nm in the ‘S-curved’ sequences (i.e. green-colored
area of sequence 6 in Figure 3C) were ignored in the calcu-
lation. The resulting CD/+ data are tabulated in Table 1. It
was noted that the averages CD/+ value (0.41) for ‘bucket-
shaped CD’ sequences are much greater than that (0.25)
from the ‘S-curved’ ones. Also noted was that the series
with 50-T (sequences 13–16) all exhibited ‘bucket-shaped
CDs’ (Figure 3B) with consistently higher CD/+ values com-

The S/B population ratios of the four different 30flanking
bases have been studied with either A (sequences 5–8) or C
(sequences 9–12) as the 50-flanking bases. The results were
plotted againstDG (Figure 4A) and Tm (Figure 4B). In each
case, the % B-conformation exhibited inverse correlations.
We observed linear correlations between % B-conformation
and the CD/+ values (R
2 ¼ 0.896 and 0.774 for sequences
5–8 and 9–12, respectively, Figure 4C). It was noted that
both the % B and CD/+ values increased in the order of
30-T > C > A > G regardless of the nature of the 50-flanking
bases (A or C).

DISCUSSION
The precise mechanisms by which carcinogen–DNA
motifs are recognized by repair or replication proteins are
of immense interest from the standpoint of the structure–
function relationships. A key outstanding question is to define
how base sequence context governs equilibria between dif-
ferent conformations in carcinogen–DNA adducts. Is a given
sequence context better repaired than another? Is one sequence
context more prone to miscode during replication than
another? Are there unique conformers that are more or less
repair susceptible, and/or more likely to produce mutation on
replication? Answers to these questions are directly related
to our understanding of mutational hotspots for carcinogen
damage. The AF-system is uniquely well placed to address
these questions because of its known sequence-dependent
conformational heterogeneity (15,16). In the present study,
we conducted a systematic thermomelting and CD investiga-
tion to probe the sequence effects on the AF-induced confor-
mational heterogeneity.
Thermomelting data
In accordance with observations made employing other bulky
lesion-modified DNA duplexes including mismatches and
bulges (12,16–18,25), we found that AF modification consis-
tently lowered thermal- (Tm) and thermodynamic (DG) sta-
bilities. DNA destabilization arises from decreased enthalpy,
which can be produced by a loss of base stacking and pairing
near the lesion site (12,18). The differences in the thermal
(DTm) and thermodynamic (DDG, DDH) stabilities represent
the direct effect of AF modification on the corresponding
unmodified duplex. The stabilities of both the control and
the modified duplexes were found to be sensitive to the spe-
cific nature of the flanking bases. In general, duplex stability
was enhanced by purine bases (G, A) flanking the lesion site.
Specifically, Tm and DG of both the unmodified and the
modified duplexes were lower with A and T adjacent to the
lesion site, than with G and C, in both 50- and 30-directions
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The effect of base polarity
was pronounced, especially for those flanked with A:T base
pairs. For example, DG increased by 2 kcal/mol when T:A
base pairs in sequence 16 were replaced by A:T base pairs in
sequence 6. A smaller increase (1.1 kcal/mol) was observed
when G:C base pairs were replaced by C:G base pairs (i.e.
sequence 11 to 1). An excellent correlation (R2 ¼ 0.884)
between DG and Tm was obtained for all the unmodified
and modified duplexes indicates that the AF-modified
duplexes follow a typical pattern of bulky adduct-induced
destabilization of the secondary structure of DNA at or near
the adduct site due to the loss of base stacking and base
pairing.
An important finding from current study is the inverse
correlative relationship observed between Tm/DG and %
B-conformer population of sequences 5–8 (Figure 4A
and B). The Tm and DG values observed are the con-
sequence of relative contributions from the B- and S-
conformer components of the AF-duplex populations. While
adduct formation is generally known to induce thermal and
thermodynamic destabilization (18), it is not clear which
conformer, S or B, actually contributes more to destabiliza-
tion. This question is critical as DNA conformation is a major
determining factor for translesion synthesis and repair sus-
ceptibility (3,15–17). The lack of Watson–Crick base pairing
at the lesion site in the S-conformer suggests that it may be
the S-conformer. However, it has been shown that deletion
duplexes containing bulky carcinogens (AAF and BP-N2-dG
adducts) predominantly adopt the S-type conformation, yet
exhibit unusually higher Tm values (16,17). Clearly, the stack-
ing interaction between the carcinogenic moiety and flanking
DNA bases is a driving force for such stabilization. Although
the modified dG of B-conformer is hydrogen-bonded to the
dC at the modification site, it is possible that the highly

hydrophobic AF moiety in the major groove may have an
unfavorable solvation, destabilizing the local DNA structure
thereby weakening Watson–Crick pairing. Although the
available S/B population data are limited (Table 1), the results
shown in Figure 4 suggest strongly that the B-conformer is
responsible for the AF-induced thermal and thermodynamic
destabilization of the duplex.
Circular dichroism data
The CD of DNA is sensitive to a variety of structural dis-
turbances such as the distortion of Watson–Crick base pairs,
adduct formation, and the presence of bulges and mismatches
(12,25,42–48). All of the AF-modified duplexes studied here
exhibited a characteristic CD pattern in the 210–300 nm range
with the positive band at 275 nm being the most intense,
which is typical for a global B-form DNA (Figure 3 and
Supplementary Figure S7) (37).
AF-modified duplexes exhibited sequence-dependent
adduct-induced negative CD bands in the 290–365 nm
range (defined as CD/+) which arise from the interaction
between AF and the chiral DNA. The extent (CD/+) of the
induced ellipticities was found to be directly correlated with %
B-conformation, at least for duplexes 5–12 (Figure 4C). The
physical and spectroscopic basis underlying the significance of
CD/+ is not clear. The tall positive 275 nm CD is likely to
contain contribution from the DNA itself and the excitonic
AF-C8-dG interactions, whereas the induced negative CD
reflects some asymmetric aspects of the micro-environment
of the AF-chromophore. The two CD bands are probably
interactive because of their close proximity. The B-type
conformers would maintain a non-random arrangement with
a certain degree of mobilization of the AF-chromophore in
the major groove. In contrast, the S-conformers are likely to
favor a strong interaction between the immobilized AF and
the neighboring bases. The situation is somewhat similar to
the induced CD observed at around 350 nm for BP-N2-
dG-modified adducts. Pradhan et al. (49,50) have shown
that the intensity of the induced CD of the pyrene chro-
mophore at 350 nm is modulated by the nature of the adduct
structure and the sequence context around the lesion site,
ultimately leading to the BP-N2-dG-induced conformational
heterogeneity.
The available correlations (Table 1) indicate that the CD/+
ratio and the S/B ratios, although influenced by the 30-flanking
bases, seem to be less dependent on the 50-flanking bases
except for the -AG*C- and -CG*C- sequences, where the %
S-conformation is 60 and 47%, respectively. It should also
be noted that the % S-conformer increases in the order of
30-dG > dA > dC > dT, indicating the importance of the
30-purine flanking bases for stacked conformation. Taken
together, these results suggest a unique interplay between
the extent of the AF-interaction with neighboring base pairs
and S/B-conformational heterogeneity, i.e. the greater the
negative 290–350 nm ellipticity, the greater the % B popula-
tion, a major contributor to the destabilization of AF-modified
duplexes. It should be emphasized, however, that the available
NMR-based S/B ratios are limited only to the -AG*N- and
CG*N- sequences. The S/B effect of the remaining 50-flanking
bases (T and G) must be obtained in order to establish the
general potential of CD/+ in assessing the AF-induced con-
formational heterogeneity in other unknown sequences.
Biological implications
Most bulky carcinogenic lesions in duplex DNA are elimi-
nated by NER (3,12,17). The AF-lesion excision efficiency by
the E.coli UvrABC system is known to depend on the extent of
base pair destabilization and the sequence context around the
lesion site (3,11,12). Mekhovich et al. (51) have shown that
the rate of incision of AF adducts is significantly faster when
it is positioned in the mutation hot spot NarI sequence
(50-GGCG*CC-30), than when located in a non-NarI sequence
(50-GATG*ATA-30). According to previous high resolution
1H NMR studies (16), AF-modified duplexes with -CG*
C- and -TG*A- sequence contexts have been shown to
adopt 30–50% and 60–70% B-conformation, respectively.
This is in good agreement with our CD results, which showed
that the CD/+ value for the -TG*A- sequence context was
nearly twice that for the -CG*C- context (Table 1). The base
composition of the central trimer of these sequences is ident-
ical to those of sequence 11 (47% B) in the present work and
of sequence 14 (55%) in our previous study (19). While the
overall sequence contexts and chain lengths of these sequences
differ, the results seem to suggest that the S-conformer has
greater repair susceptibility than the B-type conformer. How-
ever, Zou et al. (11) have shown that AF-adducts in a -TG*
T- sequence context are incised more efficiently than those in
a -CG*C- sequence context. The presence of a T:A base pair
in the flanking positions relative to the modified dG* may
allow for greater local flexibility and conformational hetero-
geneity than in a -CG*C- sequence. This is consistent with our
findings which showed lower Tm (39
C) and DG (6.8 kcal/
mol) values for sequence 16 (-TG*T-, Table 1). NMR data are
not yet available for the -TG*T- context; however, its rela-
tively large CD/+ value (0.56) implies that the sequence may
exist primarily in the B-type conformation. These results illus-
trate the complexity of how multi-conformeric adducts inter-
act with repair proteins, information that is crucial to the first
step in damage recognition in NER (17,18,52).
