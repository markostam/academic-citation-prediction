Abstract Keratinocytes require abundant cholesterol for
cutaneous permeability barrier function; hence, the regula-
tion of cholesterol homeostasis is of great importance.
ABCA1 is a membrane transporter responsible for choles-
terol efflux and plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular
cholesterol levels. We demonstrate that ABCA1 is expressed
in cultured human keratinocytes (CHKs) and murine epi-
dermis. Liver X receptor (LXR) activation markedly stim-
ulates ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels in CHKs and mouse
epidermis. In addition to LXR, activators of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)a, PPARb/d, and
retinoid X receptor (RXR), but neither PPARg nor retinoic
acid receptor, also increase ABCA1 expression in CHKs. In-
creases in cholesterol supply induced by LDL or mevalonate
stimulate ABCA1 expression, whereas inhibiting cholesterol
synthesis with statins or cholesterol sulfate decreases ABCA1
expression in CHKs. After acute permeability barrier disrup-
tion by either tape-stripping or acetone treatment, ABCA1
expression declines, and this attenuates cellular cholesterol
efflux, making more cholesterol available for regeneration
of the barrier. In addition, during fetal epidermal develop-
ment,ABCA1expressiondecreases atdays 18–22of gestation
(term 5 22 days), leaving more cholesterol available during
the critical period of barrier formation. Together, our re-
sults show that ABCA1 is expressed in keratinocytes, where it
is negatively regulated by a decrease in cellular cholesterol
levels or altered permeability barrier requirements and
positively regulated by activators of LXR, PPARs, and RXR
or increases in cellular cholesterol levels.—Jiang, Y. J., B. Lu,

Cholesterol levels are tightly regulated in cells, and the
maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is of particular
importance in keratinocytes/epidermis. In addition to
being an essential component of all cell membranes, cho-
lesterol is also required in keratinocytes to form lamellar
bodies (1). Secretion of these unique organelles then de-
livers lipids, including cholesterol, to the extracellular
spaces of the stratum corneum, which mediate permeabil-
ity barrier function (1). The ability to limit the transcuta-
neous movement of water and electrolytes is required for
terrestrial life. Although cholesterol synthesis rates are high
under basal conditions, after permeability barrier disrup-
tion cholesterol synthesis increases (2), as do the levels of
receptors that enhance the uptake of cholesterol into the
cell, such as the LDL receptor and scavenger receptor class
B type I (3, 4). Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis per-
turbs permeability barrier function (5), and a selective de-
ficiency in cholesterologenesis largely accounts for the
barrier abnormality in chronologically aged epidermis
(6, 7). Cholesterol is also the precursor of an important
bioregulatorymolecule in keratinocytes, cholesterol sulfate
(CS), which regulates corneocyte desquamation and
cohesion (8, 9) and keratinocyte differentiation (10–12).
Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated by a balance be-
tween the de novo synthesis of cholesterol, the uptake of
cholesterol from lipoproteins, and cholesterol efflux. The
efflux of cholesterol from cells is mediated predominantly
by ABCA1, which is a member of the ATP binding cassette
transporter superfamily that contains 12 putative trans-
membrane domains and two ABCs (13, 14). The impor-
tance of ABCA1 is shown by Tangier disease, in which
ABCA1 deficiency results in the accumulation of choles-
teryl esters in various tissues and clinically shows markedly
enlarged yellow tonsils and very low HDL cholesterol levels
(15–18). ABCA1 promotes the transport of cholesterol
and phospholipids across cell membranes, where these
lipids then complex with acceptor particles, such as apolipo-
protein A-I, leading to HDL formation (14), thereby reg-

ulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis (19). Activation of
liver X receptor (LXR) by oxysterols and other pharma-
cologic ligands increases ABCA1 gene expression (20–22).
As levels of cellular cholesterol increase, the levels of
oxysterols also increase, leading to the activation of LXR
and an increase in cholesterol efflux (22). In macro-
phages, the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors (PPARs)g and b/d has also been shown to in-
crease LXR expression, indirectly affecting ABCA1 ex-
pression and cholesterol efflux (23, 24). Finally, three
ABCA1 alternative transcripts have been identified in liver
and macrophages, and expression of these alternative
transcripts is regulated differentially in response to envi-
ronmental stimuli (25, 26).
Previously, we and others have demonstrated that the
nuclear hormone receptors LXR-a, and -b as well as PPARs
a, b/d, and g are expressed in epidermis/keratinocytes
(27–30). The activation of PPARs and LXRs stimulates
keratinocyte differentiation, accelerates the development
of the epidermis in fetal rats, increases the expression of
Sult2B1b, which catalyzes the synthesis of CS, and stimulates
epidermal lipid synthesis, thereby improving epidermal
permeability barrier homeostasis (28, 31–35). Whether the
activation of LXRs and PPARs regulates ABCA1 in ker-
atinocytes remains unknown.
In this study, we explored the regulation of ABCA1 in
keratinocytes and the epidermis. We hypothesized that
when the epidermal keratinocytes require cholesterol for
the formation of the permeability barrier, the expression
of ABCA1 would decrease, allowing the cell to retain cho-
lesterol for permeability barrier homeostasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Hairless female mice (hr/hr), 6–8 weeks old, were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Timed preg-
nant Sprague-Dawley rats (plug date 5 day 0), estimated gesta-
tional age days 17–22, were obtained from Simonsen Laboratories
(Gilroy, CA). 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol (22R), 25-hydroxycholes-
terol [25(OH)], clofibrate, WY14643, all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), CS, lovastatin, 8-bromo-
adenosine-39,59-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), and mevalo-
nate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Ciglitazone and
TO901317 (TO)were purchased fromCaymanChemical Co. (Ann
Arbor, MI). The PPARd activator GW 610742X was a generous gift
from Dr. Tim Willson (GlaxoSmithKline). Human LDL was from
Intracel Resources, LLC (Frederick, MD). LPS (Escherichia coli
55:B5) was obtained from Difco and freshly diluted to the desired
concentration in pyrogen-free 0.9% saline. Cytokines (human
tumornecrosis factor-a and interleukin-6)were fromR&DSystems,
Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Molecular-grade chemicals such as TRI
reagent were obtained from either Sigma or Fisher Scientific
(Fairlawn, NJ). [a-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from
New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). The Advantage RT-for-PCR
kit for first-strand cDNA synthesis was purchased from BD Bio-
sciences (Palo Alto, CA). All reagents and supplies for real-time
PCR were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).
Primary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against human
ABCA1 were purchased from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and
NovusBiologicals, Inc. (Littleton,CO), respectively.Polyclonalanti-
bodies against human ABCA1 also cross-react with mouse tissue.
All other reagents for Western blot (NuPAGET Novex precast gels,
3–8% Tris-acetate), buffers, protein standards, and detection kits
were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
Keratinocyte culture
Human foreskin keratinocytes, second passage, were seeded
and maintained in 0.07 mM Ca21 KGM (serum-free keratino-
cytes growth medium; Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Once the cells
attached, the culture medium was switched to either 0.03 mM
Ca21 (low Ca21) or 1.2 mM Ca21 (high Ca21). In the presence of
high Ca21, keratinocytes are induced to differentiate. In a typical
experiment, cells were treated with each reagent at its optimized
concentration at preconfluence (60–70%) in either low or high
calcium conditions and were harvested at 80–100% confluence.
Control keratinocytes were treated with vehicle (0.05% ethanol
or DMSO).
Animal treatment
Adult mouse skin was treated twice per day for 3.5 days with
either vehicle (100% acetone) or the LXR activator TO (15 mM).
At the end of treatment, the dorsal skin was collected and epi-
dermis was isolated as described previously (4).
Acute barrier disruption model
Adult mouse skin was treated either by gently applying acetone-
soaked cotton balls for 5–10 min or by sequential applications of
cellophane tape as described previously (2, 36). For acetone
treatment, each group contained five mice; controls for acetone
perturbation of the barrier were treated with cotton balls soaked
in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. For the tape-strippingmodel, each
group contained six mice; untreated animals served as controls
for tape stripping. The transepidermal water loss was measured
immediately after treatment using a Meeco electrolytic water
analyzer as described previously (2). Animals with a transepider-
mal water loss rate of >4 mg/cm2/h (normal , 0.3 mg/cm2/h)
after barrier disruption were included in this study.
Epidermis preparation
The whole skin from each estimated gestational age group
of rat fetus was collected as described (37). For epidermis isola-
tion, adult mouse or fetal rat skin was placed dermis side down in
10 mM EDTA in calcium-magnesium-free PBS (pH 7.4) for 35–
45 min at 378C (4). The skin was blotted dry, and the epidermis
was separated from dermis by scraping with a scalpel blade.
Alternatively, full-thickness mouse skin was incubated in 10 mM
DTT in PBS (pH 7.4) for 40 min at 378C. Epidermal fractions
(outer and lower layers) were removed, snap-frozen in liquid ni-
trogen, and stored at2808C until processed (38). For the fetal rat
study, four samples were analyzed for each time point. For day
19, 20, 21, and 22 rats, epidermis was isolated from a single fetus
for each sample. For day 17 and 18 rats, to obtain enough sam-
ples for RNA analysis, epidermis was pooled from two to three
fetuses for each data point. Experiments were repeated at least
once to ensure reproducibility.
Total RNA isolation, cDNA probes, and Northern blotting
Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, and Northern blotting was performed
as described previously (35). Briefly, Northern blots were pre-
pared and the uniformity of sample applications was checked by
ultraviolet light visualization of the acridine orange-stained gel
before transfer to Nytran membranes. Blots were then hybridized

with 32P-labeled ABCA1 probe overnight at 658C and washed.
Human ABCA1 probe was prepared using PCR, and the PCR
primer pairs used were ABCA1 forward (59-TCTCTGCTATCTC-
CAACCTCATC-39) and ABCA1 reverse (59-ACGTCTTCAC-
CAGGTAATCTGAA-39). Subsequently, the blots were exposed
to X-ray films for various durations to ensure that measurements
were performed on the linear portion of the curve, and the target
bands were quantitated by densitometry (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). The same blot was probed with cyclophilin, and
the densitometry quantitation of the target gene was adjusted for
cyclophilin or 18S level and expressed as a percentage of control,
with the control as 100%.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was carried out according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. Briefly, the whole cell extract was prepared
from either cultured human keratinocyte (CHK) or mouse epi-
dermis, and 40–50 mg of proteins was fractionated on precast
gradient gels (3–8%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluo-
ride (0.2 mM pore size) membranes overnight (48C). The proteins
on the membrane were subsequently probed with either mono-
clonal or polyclonal primary antibodies against human ABCA1
(1:1,000). The antibodies were visualized with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (polyclonal
antibodies, 1:20,000) or anti-mouse antibody (monoclonal anti-
body, 1:500) using the ECLWestern Blotting Detection System Kit.
Membranes were then exposed to CL-XPosure film. An identical
blot was probed with anti-GAPDH antibody to verify equal loading
of the protein.
Quantitative real-time PCR
First-strand cDNA for PCR was synthesized using the Advantage
RT-for-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
cDNA was synthesized from 1–2 mg of total RNA using Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with random hex-
amer primer at 428C for 60 min. Relative mRNA levels of target
genes (mouse and rat ABCA1) and an invariant transcript, 36B4,
were determined using a Mx3000PTM Real-Time PCR System
(110 V) with a notebook computer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
The primer sequences for PCR were as follows: human ABCA1
sense (59-GCAAGGCTACCAGTTACATTTG-39) and antisense
(59-GTCAGAAACATCACCTCCTG-39); mouse/rat ABCA1 sense
(59-GCAAGGCTACCAATTACATTTG-39) and antisense (59-
GGTCAGAAACATCACCTCCTG-39). Primer sequences for three
human ABCA1 alternative transcripts (exons 1b, 1c, and 1d) were
used as described (26). Individual PCRs were carried out in a
mixture of 20 ml containing 30 ng of cDNA, 600 nM forward or
reverse primers, and 10 ml of 23 SYBR Green Q-PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). The reaction was performed at 508C for
2 min and 958C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification
ofmelting at 958C for 30 s, annealing at 588C for 30 s, and extension
at 728C for 45 s on Mx3000P 96-well plates (Stratagene). PCR
was performed in triplicate and replicated in two independent
experiments. Gel electrophoresis and melting-curve analyses were
performed to confirm correct PCR product sizes and the absence
of nonspecific bands. The expression level of each gene was nor-
malized against cyclophilin (human) or 36B4 (mouse, rat) using
the comparative threshold cycle method according to the manu-
facturer’s protocols.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as means6 SEM. Comparisons between
two groups were undertaken using two-tailed and unpaired t-
tests. Differences in values are considered significant at P, 0.05.
RESULTS
ABCA1 is expressed in CHKs but is not affected by
changes in differentiation
We initially assessed whether ABCA1 is present in CHKs
and regulated by keratinocyte differentiation. As shown in
Fig. 1, a single band corresponding to ABCA1 mRNA was
detectedbyNorthern blot analysis in undifferentiated kera-
tinocytes. When these cells were differentiated by increas-
ing the calcium content of the medium, there was no
change in ABCA1 mRNA levels, indicating that the expres-
sion of ABCA1 in CHKs is not regulated by changes in dif-
ferentiation alone. These results confirm previous studies
by Schmitz’s group (39) demonstrating that ABCA1 is ex-
pressed in CHKs but does not change with differentiation.
Activation of LXR, PPARs, and RXR increases ABCA1
mRNA expression in CHKs
Wenext assessed whether ABCA1 is regulated by the acti-
vation of LXR, PPARs, and retinoid X receptor (RXR) in
CHKs. Before our formal experiments, the optimized dose
for each activator was determined. As shown in Fig. 2A,
ABCA1 mRNA level increased markedly by LXR activa-
tion [22R, 5-fold; 25(OH), 2-fold; TO, 4.5-fold]. Activators
of both PPARa (clofibrate) and PPARb/d (GW501516)
significantly, but to a lesser extent, also increased ABCA1
mRNA by 34% and 48%, respectively (Fig. 2B) (P , 0.05).

In contrast, activation of PPARg (ciglitazone) had no ef-
fect (Fig. 2B). Finally, an activator of RXR (9-cis-RA), but
not the activator of retinoic acid receptor (ATRA), also in-
creased ABCA1 mRNA level by 4.3-fold (Fig. 2C). We next
assessed whether LXR and PPAR activators would increase
ABCA1 mRNA levels in differentiated CHKs. As shown in
Fig. 2D, ligand activation of LXR, PPARb/d, and PPARa
increased ABCA1 mRNA levels by 2.9-, 4.7-, and 1.8-fold,
respectively. Consistent with the observations in undif-
ferentiated CHKs, activation of PPARg had no effect on
ABCA1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2D).
LXR activation increases ABCA1 mRNA expression in
both a dose- and time-dependent manner
We next determined the dose response and time course
for stimulation of ABCA1 expression by the LXR activator
22R in undifferentiated keratinocytes. As shown in Fig. 3A,
ABCA1 mRNA levels increased significantly at 5.0 mM 22R
(3.6-fold), peaked at 10 mM (5.2-fold), and decreased
slightly at 12.5 mM (4.7-fold). Furthermore, as early as 3 h,
ABCA1 levels increased by 37% (P , 0.01) and continued
to increase up to 24 h (5-fold) (Fig. 3B). Thus, the LXR-
induced increase in ABCA1 mRNA levels occurs rapidly
and is sustained for an extended period of time.
CHKs express alternative transcripts of ABCA1 that are
upregulated by LXR activators
Three alternative transcripts of ABCA1 have been iden-
tified recently in both macrophages and liver (25, 26). To
investigate which of these transcripts is expressed in CHKs,
we used quantitative real-time PCR to examine the mRNA
levels of exons 1b, 1c, and 1d of human ABCA1. As shown
in Fig. 4, all three transcripts were expressed at moderate
levels in undifferentiated CHKs, and interestingly, activa-
tion of LXR by 22R increased mRNA levels of all three
transcripts (by 4.4-, 4.8-, and 5.1-fold for exons 1b, 1c, and
1d, respectively) (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained
when cells were incubated with another LXR activator,
25(OH) (data not shown). Thus, all of the alternative vari-
ants of ABCA1 are expressed in CHKs, and these three
transcripts seem to contribute equally to the increase in
ABCA1 mRNA that occurs in response to LXR activation.
LXR activation increases ABCA1 protein expression
As shown in Fig. 5, activation of LXR by either 22R or
25(OH) markedly increased ABCA1 protein levels. To

dose- and time-dependent manner. A: Human keratinocytes were

ensure the accuracy of these results, we used two different
ABCA1 antibodies in our protocol and observed similar
results (data not shown). Thus, LXR activation enhances
not only mRNA but also protein levels of ABCA1.
Changes in cellular sterol levels regulate ABCA1 mRNA
expression in CHKs
To examine whether ABCA1 expression is regulated by
changes in cellular sterol levels, we first treated keratino-
cytes with exogenous LDL (100 mg/ml) to increase cel-
lular cholesterol levels. The addition of LDL increased
ABCA1 mRNA levels by z140% (24 h) and z200% (48 h)
in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells (Fig. 6A).
To confirm this observation, keratinocytes were treated
with various doses (200–500 mM) of mevalonate, a precur-
sor of cholesterol, and again, a dose-dependent increase in
ABCA1 mRNA level was observed (Fig. 6B). Conversely,
inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in CHKs, by incubating
cells with either lovastatin or CS, markedly decreased ABCA1
expression (Fig. 6C). Together, these results demonstrate
that ABCA1 mRNA levels are regulated by cell sterol levels,
with increases in cell cholesterol (induced by increased
cholesterol synthesis or uptake) leading to an increase in
ABCA1 expression, whereas decreases in cell cholesterol
(induced by decreased cholesterol synthesis) leading to a
decrease in ABCA1 expression.
LXR activators also increase ABCA1 expression in vivo
We next determined whether ABCA1 is also expressed
and regulated in vivo. As shown in Fig. 7, ABCA1 mRNA
was present in murine epidermis and distributed equally

Human keratinocytes were incubated with either vehicle control
or LXR activators [10 mM 22R or 25(OH)] in low-calcium medium

Western blot analyses to determine protein levels of ABCA1 as

in both the upper and lower layers of the epidermis. Be-
cause the outer epidermis (stratum corneum, stratum granu-
losum) contains more differentiated keratinocytes than
the lower layer (stratum spinosum, stratum basale), these
data are consistent with the data in undifferentiated versus
differentiated keratinocytes (Fig. 1), further demonstrat-
ing that ABCA1 mRNA levels are not regulated by diferen-
tiation. Yet, after topical application of the LXR activator
TO to mouse skin for 3.5 days, an z10-fold increase in
both ABCA1 mRNA (Fig. 8A) and protein (Fig. 8B) levels
was observed. Thus, LXR activation stimulates ABCA1 ex-
pression both in vitro and in vivo.
ABCA1 expression is regulated inversely by permeability
barrier requirements
Cholesterol is required for the formation of the perme-
ability barrier (5); therefore, we next determined ABCA1
expression after acute barrier disruption. Three hours
after barrier disruption induced by tape stripping, ABCA1
mRNA levels decreased by 64% (Fig. 9A). This decrease in
ABCA1 occurred in both the upper and lower layers of the
epidermis (Fig. 9B). Similarly, disruption of the barrier by
a second method, acetone treatment, also resulted in a
reduction in ABCA1 mRNA level (Fig. 9C).
Furthermore, ABCA1 mRNA was present in fetal rat epi-
dermis from estimated gestational age days 17–22, and a
significant decrease in ABCA1 mRNA levels occurred at
days 18–22 (Fig. 10), which coincides with the peak time of
lamellar body generation and the formation of a compe-
tent permeability barrier (40). Together, these results sug-
gest that in response to permeability barrier disruption,
ABCA1 expression is decreased, which would increase the
cholesterol available for lamellar body synthesis and
barrier formation.

topically treated with the LXR activator TO (15 mM) twice per day
for 3.5 consecutive days, and epidermis was collected. ABCA1

DISCUSSION
Cutaneous permeability is dependent on the formation
of extracellular, lipid-enriched membranes located in the
outermost layers of the epidermis, the stratum corneum.
Approximately 25% of the lipid in these membranes is
cholesterol, with the remainder consisting of free fatty
acids and ceramides (1). Both cholesterol and the other
lipids are delivered to the extracellular space when stra-
tum granulosum cells secrete lamellar body contents (1).
After acute disruption of the permeability barrier, a rapid
secretion of preformed lamellar bodies occurs, followed by
a marked increase in cholesterol synthesis, as required for
the formation of nascent lamellar bodies and the regen-
eration of the barrier (41). Topical applications of statins
inhibit epidermal cholesterol synthesis, blocking the for-
mation of lamellar bodies, provoking a delay in barrier
recovery (5, 42). In addition to stimulating lamellar body
secretion and formation, disruption of the permeability
barrier also leads to an increase in DNA synthesis and cell
proliferation (predominantly in the basal layer of the epi-
dermis), which also requires the production of abundant
cholesterol (43).
After cutaneous permeability barrier disruption, the
expression of a variety of genes is regulated to ensure a
net increase in cellular cholesterol levels. Specifically, the
mRNA levels of a number of key enzymes required for
cholesterol synthesis, including HMG-CoA synthase,
HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and
squalene synthase, increase rapidly (4, 44). Similarly, the
mRNA levels of a number of lipoprotein receptors that
increase the uptake of cholesterol into the cell, including
the LDL receptor and scavenger receptor class B type I,
increase (3, 4). Here, we demonstrate that the mRNA
levels of ABCA1, a transporter that plays a key role in the
efflux of cholesterol from cells, instead decreases after
acute barrier disruption by either acetone treatment or
repeated tape stripping. Moreover, during fetal epidermal
development, the mRNA levels of ABCA1 decrease at the
time when lamellar body formation and secretion is form-

days 17 and 18, epidermis was pooled from two to three fetuses for
each sample. Similar results were obtained when the experiment

Three hours after disrupting the barrier by either tape stripping (A,

epidermal fraction (B; upper or lower epidermis) of mouse was
isolated and real-time PCR was performed to determine ABCA1
mRNA levels. Data are expressed as percentages of control, plotted,
and presented as means 6 SEM. Each group contained six mice
for tape stripping and control (Con) or five mice for acetone
treatment and control; epidermis was isolated from each individual

ing the permeability barrier. A decrease in cholesterol
efflux from keratinocytes would facilitate the formation
of lamellar bodies by ensuring an available supply of cho-
lesterol. Thus, a decrease in ABCA1 expression in stratum
granulosum cells (upper epidermis) when accelerated la-
mellar body formation is required after permeability
barrier disruption is not unexpected. However, we demon-
strated a decrease in ABCA1 mRNA levels not only in the
stratum granulosum but also in the lower epidermis. We
speculate that because of the marked increase in DNA
synthesis and cell proliferation in the lower epidermis that
occurs after permeability barrier disruption (43), there is
an increased cellular requirement for cholesterol in the
keratinocytes of the lower epidermis. In support of this
hypothesis, we have demonstrated in previous studies an
increase in cholesterol synthesis in both the upper and
lower epidermis after barrier disruption (38).
Studies from other laboratories have shown that cho-
lesterol levels in cells regulate ABCA1 (45). Here, we
demonstrate that cellular cholesterol levels also regulate
ABCA1 expression in keratinocytes. When the cellular
cholesterol supply increased by either providing exoge-
nous cholesterol (LDL) or increasing synthesis by pro-
viding mevalonate, ABCA1 expression was upregulated.
Conversely, when the cellular cholesterol content de-
creased by incubating cells with either statins or CS,
inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase that inhibit choles-
terol synthesis, ABCA1 expression was repressed. Yet, it
is well recognized that cholesterol does not directly regu-
late ABCA1 expression. Rather, cholesterol is converted
to oxysterols (not yet identified) that activate LXR. Within
the promoter of ABCA1, there is a response element that
binds LXR (RXR), and in the presence of either an LXR
or RXR ligand, ABCA1 transcription is stimulated (45).
PPAR activators have also been shown to stimulate ABCA1
expression, and they do this indirectly by increasing LXR-a
levels (23, 46). Here, we demonstrate that in keratinocytes,
PPARa or PPARb/d activators also increase ABCA1 mRNA
levels, likely secondary to an increase in LXR-b levels. In
support of this hypothesis, treatment of keratinocytes with
PPARa or PPARb/d activators significantly increased
mRNA levels of LXR-b (2.6- and 2.8-fold respectively; un-
published observation), which is the predominant recep-
tor in keratinocytes/epidermis (28). In contrast, PPARg
activator decreased LXR-b mRNA expression [by 58%
(P5 0.019); unpublished observation], which may explain
the lack of ABCA1 stimulation by PPARg activator in this
study (Fig. 2B, D).
We speculate that after acute permeability barrier dis-
ruption or during fetal development when the barrier is
first being formed, the increased requirements of choles-
terol for lamellar body formation decrease cellular cho-
lesterol levels, leading to a decrease in the formation of the
oxysterols that activate LXR. When this occurs, the ex-
pression of ABCA1 declines, which decreases cholesterol
efflux, thereby helping to maintain cellular cholesterol
levels. On the other hand, the increases in the enzymes
necessary for cholesterol synthesis and the receptors in-
volved in the uptake of cholesterol in lipoproteins would
also help to maintain cellular cholesterol levels (47). Yet,
the regulation of the expression of these genes is not via
the oxysterol-LXR pathway but rather by the proteolytic
activation of sterol-regulatory element binding proteins, a
process that is regulated by the sterol content of the endo-
plasmic reticulum (48).
In both macrophages and liver, there are three alter-
nativeABCA1 transcripts (exons 1b, 1c, and 1d); each arises
from different exon 1 sequences that are spliced into exon
2, andall produce full-lengthproteins (25). Yet, in response
to a high-fat diet, exon 1d is preferentially increased in the
liver and exon 1b is increased in macrophages (26). In-
terestingly, in this study, we found that all three alternative
transcripts are present in CHKs; upon LXR activation, the
expression of these three transcripts is upregulated to a
similar extent (Fig. 4). Thus, in response to environmental
stimuli, the expression pattern of ABCA1 transcripts in
different tissues varies. Finally, although in macrophages
ABCA1 expression is regulated by other factors, including
ATRA (49, 50), 8-Br-cAMP (51), tumor necrosis factor-a,
interleukin-6, and LPS (52), in CHKs, there was no effect of
any of these compounds (data not shown). Themechanism
of the tissue-specific regulation of these various stimulators
remains unclear.
In summary, cholesterol homeostasis is very important
in keratinocytes because of the unique needs of keratino-
cytes for cholesterol. In this study, we demonstrate that a
key transporter in cholesterol efflux, ABCA1, is present in
keratinocytes, is regulated by cellular cholesterol levels
and LXR and PPAR activation, and decreases when choles-
terol is required for permeability barrier formation.
