ABSTRACT
The PUMA2 system (available at http://compbio.mcs.
10 anl.gov/puma2) is an interactive, integrated bioin-
formatics environment for high-throughput genetic
sequence analysis and metabolic reconstructions
from sequence data. PUMA2 provides a framework
for comparative and evolutionary analysis of geno-
15 mic data and metabolic networks in the context of
taxonomic and phenotypic information. Grid infra-
structure is used to perform computationally intens-
ive tasks. PUMA2 currently contains precomputed
analysis of 213 prokaryotic, 22 eukaryotic, 650 mito-
20 chondrial and 1493 viral genomes and automated
metabolic reconstructions for .200 organisms.
Genomic data is annotated with information integ-
rated from .20 sequence, structural and metabolic
databases and ontologies. PUMA2 supports both
25 automated and interactive expert-driven annotation
of genomes, using a variety of publicly available bio-
informatics tools. It also contains a suite of unique
PUMA2 tools for automated assignment of gene
function, evolutionary analysis of protein families
30 and comparative analysis of metabolic pathways.
PUMA2 allows users to submit batch sequence data
for automated functional analysis and construction
of metabolic models. The results of these analyses
are made available to the users in the PUMA2 envir-
35 onment for further interactive sequence analysis
and annotation.
INTRODUCTION
Evolutionary analysis of a wide spectrum of diverse organisms
is essential for understanding how they adapt to environments.
40 Common ancestry of eukaryotes and prokaryotes leads to
similarity of many molecular functions. However, differences
in organisms’ structural complexity, physiology and lifestyle
result in divergent evolution and emergence of variants of
molecular function, metabolic organization and phenotypic
45features. Recent progress in genomics, bioinformatics and
physiological studies allows for systematic exploration of
adaptive mechanisms that led to diversification of biological
systems. Such adaptive changes usually are not limited to
one component of the system; on the contrary, in the process
50of adaptation, organisms undergo co-adaptive changes, such
as the complementary changes of protein sequences to accom-
modate changes in an enzyme’s active site or co-evolution of
properties of different steps in metabolic pathways.
PUMA2, available at http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/puma2,
55provides an environment for studying co-evolution of gen-
omes and metabolic pathways and enzymes. It also supports
the comparative analysis of sequence data and metabolic
pathways for identification, analysis and characterization of
evolutionary patterns associated with particular phylogenetic
60neighborhoods or phenotypes. The system enables high-
throughput automated analysis of genomes, development of
metabolic reconstructions from sequence data and community
curation of genomic and metabolic data (Figure 1).
A number of excellent resources such as KEGG (1),
65MetaCyc (2) and IMG (3) support high-throughput analysis
of genomes and metabolic reconstructions. Although PUMA2
has numerous commonalities with these systems, it offers
a number of unique features. In brief PUMA2 (i) supports
the interactive development of user models for public and
70user-submitted genomes; (ii) utilizes Grid technology for com-
putationally intensive tasks; and (iii) provides new tools for
comparative analysis of genomes and metabolic networks in
the framework of taxonomic and phenotypic information.
These last two features represent major differences between
75PUMA2 and its predecessor, the WIT2 system (4).
In addition to genome analysis, PUMA2 supports compre-
hensive annotation of genomes. The PUMA2 knowledge base
integrates information from >20 public databases, including

10 AUTOMATED HIGH-THROUGHPUT
ANALYSIS OF GENOMES IN PUMA2
Currently, the PUMA2 system contains automated precom-
puted analysis of 213 prokaryotic, 22 eukaryotic, 650 mito-
chondrial and 1493 viral genomes and automated metabolic
15 reconstructions for >200 organisms. All data in PUMA2 are
periodically updated. Sequence data in PUMA2 are obtained
from the public sequence databases or provided by the users. It
is analyzed by a variety of bioinformatics tools [e.g. BLAST
(15), Blocks (16), Pfam (17), PepStats (18) and TMHMM
20(19)], as well as PUMA2 tools for prediction of gene functions
and evolutionary analysis of enzymatic functions [e.g. Chisel
and PhyloBlocks]. Grid technology is used to perform com-
putationally intensive tasks. The results of these precomputed
analyses are integrated into the database and presented to
25the users. PUMA2 tools for gene function prediction utilize
the results of precomputed analyses of genomic data using
BLAST, as well as InterPro, Blocks and TMHMM, to perform
rules-based classification of the un-annotated sequences.
PUMA2 also supports interactive analysis of sequences by
30the users, providing access to >40 publicly available bioin-
formatics tools.
PUMA2 environment for data curation by users
Although automated analysis may provide useful initial
annotation of the genomes, these results require rigorous cura-
35tion by expert biologists. PUMA2 provides registered users
with tools for user-driven metabolic model development, reas-
signment of functions to genes and addition of comments. The
user annotations in PUMA2 are persistent and are presented to
the user when logged into the system.

PUMA2 sequence analysis tools
PUMA2 contains a suite of tools to facilitate the identification
of evolutionary patterns and motifs characteristic of particular
biological functions and their variations. The suite includes
5 the following:
(i) Chisel, a web-based computational workbench for evolu-
tionary analysis of enzymatic sequences (http://compbio.
mcs.anl.gov/CHISEL). Chisel utilizes information from
the PUMA2 knowledge base to perform rules-based clus-
10 tering and classification of annotated enzymatic sequences
into functional categories. The resulting clusters are
used for developing a library of Hidden Markov Models
(HMM profiles) for particular enzymatic functions and
(when possible) their taxonomic and phenotypic varia-
15 tions. These profiles are used by the classification tool
for prediction of functions of hypothetical proteins.
(ii) PhyloBlocks, a tool that allows a user to develop
high-resolution HMM profiles for particular protein
family interactively (http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/ulrich/
20 phyloblock).
(iii) Tools for comparative analysis of enzymes and metabolic
networks in phenotypic and taxonomic framework.
PUMA2 allows to perform analyses of the data that allow
25 users to ask such questions as ‘What metabolic pathways
are common between hyperthermophilic organisms that live
in aquatic environment?’ and ‘What variations of L-lactate
dehydrogenase is characteristic for Firmicutes?’.
Metabolic reconstructions from
30 sequence data in PUMA2
The technology of metabolic reconstructions from sequence
data (1,4,20,21) proved useful for developing organism and
process-specific functional models. PUMA2 currently con-
tains automated metabolic reconstructions from the sequence
35 data for >200 completely sequenced organisms. The system
supports the development of automated metabolic reconstruc-
tions, which provide an initial basis for the development of
expert-curated models. The developed metabolic reconstruc-
tions are based on pathway data from the EMP collection of
40 enzymes and metabolic pathways, being developed by the
EMP Project Inc., containing enzymatic information and
metabolic diagrams accumulated from the literature describ-
ing >3000 metabolic pathways in a structured, indexed and
searchable form. PUMA2 provides tools for comparative
45 analysis of metabolic networks that allow identification of
variations of the metabolic pathways characteristic for particu-
lar organisms or taxonomic groups of organisms, identification
of ‘missing’ enzymes and viewing of the pathway data in a
larger context of hierarchy of biological processes. PUMA2
50 metabolic reconstructions provide links to sequence data
and enzymatic data. Genomic data and metabolic models in
PUMA2 are annotated with the GO terms and cross-referenced
with BioPAX format (22). Such representation simplifies
navigation and comparative analyses of metabolic networks.
55 PUMA2 use of grid technology for
high-throughput analysis
High-throughput computations in PUMA2 are performed
by an automated Genome Analysis and Database Update
(GADU) server with a grid-based distributed computational
60backend (23). GADU was developed as a collaboration
between the ANL Globus group and the bioinformatics
group in the framework of the NSF NCSA alliance. It lever-
ages experience and technology developed by the GriPhyn
(Physics Grid) project. High-throughput computations in
65GADU are performed by using distributed heterogeneous
grid computing resources such as Grid2003 (24), OSG and
the DOE Science Grid. Periodic updates of the PUMA2 system
and analysis of the sequence data using BLAST, Blocks, Pfam,
Chisel and the like are performed in the form of scientific
70workflows expressed and controlled by a ‘virtual data’
model using the Chimera Virtual Data System (25), which
transparently maps computational workflows to distributed
grid resources.
Using the GADU system allows for automated genetic
75sequence analysis of an average bacterial genome (4000
protein sequences), development of automated metabolic
reconstructions and integration of resulting models in the
PUMA2 framework and its presentation to the user via a
web interface in <3 h. Such analysis includes analysis of
80the genome by BLAST and Blocks, automated assignment
of functions to genes and development of automated metabolic
reconstructions.
PUMA2 support of genomes provided by users
Some users are interested in analyses of genomes that are not
85yet included in the PUMA2 framework. PUMA2 provides
automated analyses of user-submitted sets of sequences.
These sequence sets may be complete or incomplete genomes
or sets of sequences of interest to the user. Limited amounts
(up to 50 sequences) of user-submitted protein sequences may
90be analyzed via the PUMA2 website. Analysis of larger
amounts of user-provided genomic data is available per
request.
AVAILABILITY
PUMA2 is available for use via the web-based user interface
95at http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/puma2. The following datasets
are available on request: metabolic data from EMP database in
BioPax (OWL) format and precomputed results from organ-
ism specific analyses by BLAST, Blocks and Chisel. Requests
may be sent via email to puma2@mcs.anl.gov.
