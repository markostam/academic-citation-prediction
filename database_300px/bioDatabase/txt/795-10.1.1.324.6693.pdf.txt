program optimized to search specialized data sets.
These resources can be accessed through the NCBI
home page at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
INTRODUCTION
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
at the National Institutes of Health was created in 1988 to
develop information systems for molecular biology. In addi-
tion to maintaining the GenBank (1) nucleic acid sequence
database, to which data is submitted by the scientific
community, NCBI provides data retrieval systems and com-
putational resources for the analysis of GenBank data as
well as a variety of other biological data. For the purposes
of this article, the NCBI suite of database resources is
grouped into six broad categories. All resources discussed
are available from the NCBI home page at www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov. In most cases, the data underlying these resources
is available for bulk download at ftp.ncbi.nih.gov, a link
from the NCBI home page.
DATABASE RETRIEVAL TOOLS
Entrez
Entrez (2) is an integrated database retrieval system that
enables text searching, using simple Boolean queries, of a
diverse set of 31 databases. Global Query, the default search
on the NCBI homepage, searches across all the Entrez
databases and rapidly returns the counts of matching records
in each database. A user may then display results or further
refine searches in any individual database. The Entrez data-
bases include 91 million DNA and protein sequences
derived from several sources (1,3–6), the NCBI taxonomy,
genomes, population sets, gene expression data, over
1.2 million gene-oriented sequence clusters in UniGene,
almost 500 000 sequence-tagged sites in UniSTS, 34 million
genetic variations in dbSNP, over 36 000 protein structures

from the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB) (6),
168 000 3D and 12 000 alignment-based protein domains,
and the biomedical literature via PubMed, Pubmed Central
(PMC), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and
online books. The books database contains >60 online scient-
ific textbooks. To enable researchers to quickly reach the
appropriate NCBI resource, the content of the NCBI web
pages and FTP directories has been incorporated into an
Entrez database of its own. Searches of the NCBI web site
using the same powerful queries available for the biological
databases are therefore possible.
Entrez provides extensive links within and between
database records. In their simplest form, these links may be
cross-references between a sequence and the abstract of the
paper in which it is reported, or between a protein sequence
and its coding DNA sequence or, perhaps, its 3D-structure.
Other examples are links between a genomic assembly and
its components or between a genomic sequence and those
sequences derived from its annotation. Computationally
derived links between ‘neighboring records’ such as those
based on computed similarities among sequences or among
PubMed abstracts, allow rapid access to groups of related
records. A service called LinkOut expands the range of
links to include external services, such as organism-specific
genome databases. To accommodate the growing number of
links, Entrez provides a Links pull down menu that appears in
the top, right hand corner of record displays.
The records retrieved in Entrez can be displayed in many
formats and downloaded singly or in batches. A redirection
control allows results to be saved in a local file, shown in
the browser as plain text. Results may also be sent to the
Entrez clipboard where they may be recalled later during
an Entrez session or saved between sessions using My
NCBI, described below. In addition, PubMed results and
those from other databases may be emailed directly from
Entrez or exported as RSS feeds. Formats available for
GenBank records include the GenBank Flatfile, FASTA,
XML, ASN.1 and others. Graphical display formats are
offered for some types of records, including genomic records.
For sequence records, a formatting control allows the display
or download of a particular range of residues.
Entrez’s ‘My NCBI’ allows users to store personal config-
uration options such as search filters, LinkOut preferences
and document delivery providers. My NCBI also saves
searches and can automatically email updated search results.
Entrez uses a set of up to five filter tabs used to display
subsets of database results. The tabs vary according to Entrez
database; examples of some defaults include ‘mRNA’ and
‘RefSesq’ subsets for Nucleotide; a ‘Review’ subset for
PubMed; ‘NMR’ and ‘X-ray’ subsets for Structure. Default
filter tabs can be changed using My NCBI. Additional My
NCBI features include changing the way Entrez links are
displayed to standard html links or pull downs, and highlight-
ing PubMed search terms. A recently added My NCBI feature
called ‘Collections’ allows users to save search results and
bibliographies indefinitely.
Scripted access to Entrez is provided by the Entrez
Programming Utilities (E-Utilities), a suite of eight server-
side programs supporting a uniform set of parameters used
to search, link between, and download from, the Entrez
databases. A search history, available via interactive Entrez
as well as via the E-Utilities, allows users to recall the results
of previous searches during an Entrez session and combine
them using Boolean logic. The ‘einfo’ utility can be used to
retrieve detailed information about the Entrez databases, such
as lists of supported search fields or the date of the last
database update, while ‘egquery’ returns the number of
matches to a single query in every Entrez database. An auto-
mated system may use E-Utilities such as ‘efetch’ or ‘esum-
mary’, to retrieve the data. Espell checks spelling within
Entrez queries and offers suggestions in cases where a mis-
spelling might cause key records to be missed. Support for
the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface to the
E-Utilities was expanded during the past year, and now
supports full downloads (efetch) from nine of the Entrez data-
bases with esearch and esummary, support for all. Instruc-
tions for using the E-Utilities are found under the ‘Entrez
Tools’ link on the NCBI home page.
PubMed and PubMed Central
The PubMed database includes over 16.5 million citations
from >19 000 life science journals for biomedical articles
back to the 1950s, most with abstracts and many with links
to the full-text article. PubMed is heavily linked to other
core Entrez databases such as Nucleotide, Protein, Gene,
Structure and PubChem where it provides a crucial bridge
between the data of molecular biology and the scientific
literature. PubMed records are also linked to one another
within Entrez as ‘related articles’ on the basis of computa-
tionally detected similarities using indexed Medical Subject
Heading (7) terms and the text of titles and abstracts. To
put information about the top-ranking related articles at the
fingertips of researches, the ‘Abstract-Plus’ display for single
PubMed records was introduced this year as the default for-
mat for a single record. Abstract-Plus shows, in addition to
the abstract of a paper, succinct descriptions of the top five
related articles, increasing the potential for the discovery of
important relationships.
PubMed Central (8) is a digital archive of peer-reviewed
journals in the life sciences providing access to >750 000
full-text articles, a 50% increase over the past year. More
than 270 journals, including Nucleic Acids Research, deposit
the full text of their articles in PMC. It includes digitized
back content for many journals, going back in some cases
to the 1800s or early 1900s. Participation in PMC requires
a commitment to free access to full text, either immediately
after publication or within a 12month period. All PMC free
articles are identified in PubMed search results and PMC
itself can be searched using Entrez.
Taxonomy
The NCBI taxonomy database, growing at the rate of 2900
new taxa a month, indexes >240 000 named organisms that
are represented in the databases with at least one nucleotide
or protein sequence. The Taxonomy Browser can be used
to view the taxonomic position or retrieve data from any of
the principal Entrez databases for a particular organism or
group. The Taxonomy Browser also displays links to the
Map Viewer, Genomic BLAST services, the Trace Archive,
and to external model organism and taxonomic databases
via LinkOut. Searches of the NCBI taxonomy may be made

on the basis of whole, partial or phonetically spelled organ-
ism names. Entrez Taxonomy displays include custom taxo-
nomic trees representing user-specified subsets of the full
NCBI taxonomy.
THE BLAST FAMILY OF SEQUENCE-SIMILARITY
SEARCH PROGRAMS
The BLAST programs (9–11) perform sequence-similarity
searches against a variety of databases, returning a set of
gapped alignments with links to full database records, to
UniGene, Gene, the MMDB or Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO). One variant, BLAST2Sequences (12), compares
two DNA or protein sequences and produces a dot-plot
representation of the alignments. In addition to the Web
based versions described below, the basic BLAST programs
are available as standalone commandline programs, as
network clients and as a local web-server package (ftp://ftp.
ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/).
Each alignment returned by BLAST is scored and assigned
a measure of statistical significance called the Expectation
Value (E-value). BLAST takes into account the amino-acid
composition of the query sequence in its estimation of statis-
tical significance. This composition-based statistical treat-
ment, used in conventional protein BLAST searches as well
as PSI-BLAST searches, tends to reduce the number of
false-positive database hits (13). The alignments returned
can be limited by an E-value threshold or range.
BLAST output formats
Standard output formats include the default pairwise
alignment, several query-anchored multiple sequence align-
ment formats, an easily parsable Hit Table and a taxonomi-
cally organized output. Database sequences appearing in
BLAST results may be marked for batch retrieval using
check boxes. Alignments against database sequences that are
>200 000 bp in length are displayed with links to nearby fea-
tures, such as genes. A ‘Pairwise with identities’ mode better
highlights differences between the query and a target
sequence. An option to display masked characters in lower-
case or using distinct colors is also available. A new Tree
View option for the Web BLAST service creates a dendrogram
that clusters sequences according to their distances from the
query sequence. This display is helpful for recognizing the
presence of aberrant or unusual sequences or natural groupings
of related sequences such as members of a gene family or
homologs from other species in the BLAST output.
Web BLAST
A powerful feature of the NCBI Web BLAST interface is that
it allows both the initial search and the results displayed to be
restricted to a database subset using an Entrez query as a fil-
ter. Web BLAST also uses a standard URL-API that allows
complete search specifications, including BLAST parameters,
such as Entrez restrictions and the search query, to be con-
tained in a URL posted to the web page.
MegaBLAST
MegaBLAST (14), designed to find nearly exact matches, is
available through a Web interface that handles batch nucleotide
queries and operates up to 10 times faster than standard
nucleotide BLAST. MegaBLAST is the default search
program for NCBI’s Genomic BLAST pages. MegaBLAST
is also used to search the rapidly growing Trace Archive
and is available for the standard BLAST databases as well.
For rapid cross-species nucleotide queries, NCBI offers
Discontiguous MegaBLAST which uses a non-contiguous
word match (15) as the nucleus for its alignments. Discon-
tiguous MegaBLAST is far more rapid than a translated
search such as blastx, yet maintains a competitive degree of
sensitivity when comparing coding regions.
Genomic BLAST
NCBI maintains Genomic BLAST pages for >45 organisms
shown in the Map Viewer. Genomic BLAST may be used
to search the genomic sequence of an organism, the nucleot-
ide and protein Reference Sequences (RefSeqs) used in, and
resulting from, the annotation of the genomic sequence, or
sets of sequences, such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs),
that are mapped to the genomic sequence. The results of
Genomic BLAST searches can be displayed within their
genomic context using the Map Viewer to show, in addition
to the location of a match to the query sequence, the locations
of neighboring genes and nearby genomic landmarks. During
the past year, a system was implemented to generate
these BLAST pages automatically, allowing new organisms
to be added very quickly and providing a higher degree of
uniformity in database content.
RESOURCES FOR GENE-LEVEL SEQUENCES
Databases
Entrez Gene. Entrez Gene (16), provides an interface to
curated sequences and descriptive information about genes
with links to NCBI’s Map Viewer, Evidence Viewer (EV),
Model Maker (MM), BLAST Link (BLink), protein domains
from the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) and other gene-
related resources. Data is accumulated and maintained
through several international collaborations in addition to
curation by in-house staff. Links within Gene to the newest
citations in PubMed are maintained by curators and provided
as Gene References into Function (GeneRIF). The GeneRIF
link within Gene reports leads to a form allowing researchers
to add GeneRIFs to a Gene report. Entrez Gene displays use a
collapsible navigation panel containing a table of contents for
the record, the set of links to other resources, and links to
related NCBI tools. The complete Entrez Gene data set, as
well as organism-specific subsets, is available in the compact
NCBI ASN.1 format on the NCBI FTP site. A tool that
converts the native Gene ASN.1 format into XML, called
‘gene2xml’ is available for several popular computer
platforms at ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi\s\do5(t)ools/
converters/by\s\do5(p)rogram/gene2xml/. The tool supports
filtering by organism so that organism-specific XML files can
easily be generated from the comprehensive ASN.1 FTP file.
UniGene. UniGene (17), is a system for partitioning GenBank
sequences, including ESTs, into a non-redundant set of gene-
oriented clusters. Each UniGene cluster contains sequences
that represent a unique gene, and is linked to the tissue

types in which the gene is expressed, model organism protein
similarities and Entrez Gene. UniGene clusters are created for
all organisms for which there are 70 000 or more ESTs in
GenBank and includes ESTs for some 37 animals and another
37 plants and fungi. For the human UniGene June 2006
release (build 194), over 7.0 million human ESTs in GenBank
were reduced 80-fold in number to 87 000 sequence clus-
ters. When sufficient genomic sequence is available, UniGene
clusters are built using a genome-based clustering system to
identify sets of transcript sequences which correspond to dis-
tinct transcription loci or to annotated genes. The procedure
used for genome-based clustering of transcript sequences is
described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/build2.
html. The UniGene collection has been used as a source of
unique sequences for the fabrication of microarrays for the
large-scale study of gene expression (18). UniGene databases
are updated weekly with new EST sequences, and bimonthly
with newly characterized sequences.
ProtEST. ProtEST, tightly coupled to UniGene, presents
pre-computed BLAST alignments between protein sequences
from model organisms and the six-frame translations of nuc-
leotide sequences in UniGene. ProtEST links are displayed in
UniGene reports with model organism protein similarities.
HomoloGene. HomoloGene is a system for automated
detection of homologs among the annotated genes of 18
completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes including those
of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus
norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Sac-
charomyces cerevisiae, Eremothecium gossypii, Neurospora
crassa, Magnaporthe grisea, Arabidopsis thaliana and
Oryza sativa. The HomoloGene build procedure is guided
by the taxonomic tree, and relies on conserved gene order
and measures of DNA similarity among closely related
species, while making use of protein similarity for more
distantly related organisms. HomoloGene reports include
homology and phenotype information drawn from OMIM,
Mouse Genome Informatics (19), Zebrafish Information Net-
work (20), Saccharomyces Genome Database (21), Clusters
of Orthologous Groups (COG) (22) and FlyBase. A Pairwise
Scores display gives a table of statistics for protein and
nucleotide sequences among members of a Homologene
group. HomoloGene entries include paralogs in addition to
orthologs. HomoloGene can be queried using Entrez at
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db¼homologene.
The Database for the Major Histocompatbility Complex. The
Database for the Major Histocompatbility Complex (dbMHC)
contains variations found in alleles of the Major Histocom-
patibility Complex (MHC), a highly variable array of genes
playing a vital role in the success of organ transplants
and susceptibility to infectious diseases. dbMHC contains
hundreds of sequences for MHC alleles and data on typing
kits used by academic, clinical and industrial laboratories.
The database includes data arising from a survey of Human
Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele frequency distributions as
well as a project to collect HLA genotype and clinical
outcome information on hematopoietic cell transplants per-
formed worldwide. In addition, support for three new projects
related to Type 1 Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Natural
Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors, respectively, was
added over the past year. Access to the data, lists of con-
tributors, as well as a number of online tools for data
analysis are provided at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mhc/MHC.
cgi?cmd¼init.
A database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (dbSNP) . The
database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (23), a reposi-
tory for single base nucleotide substitutions and short deletion
and insertion polymorphisms, contains over 12 million
human SNPs and another 22 million from a variety of other
organisms, with 14 million of these added over the past year.
SNP reports link to 3D structures from the MMDB via
NCBI’s interactive macromolecular structure viewer, Cn3D
(24), to highlight implied amino acid changes in coding
regions. dbSNP provides additional information about the
validation status, population-specific allele frequencies and
individual genotypes for dbSNP submission. These data are
available on the dbSNP FTP site in XML-structured genotype
reports that include information and about cell lines, pedigree
IDs and error flags for genotype inconsistencies and incom-
patibilities. Haplotype and linkage disequilibrium data are
being incorporated in dbSNP as data are released from the
International HapMap project. Functional variants are identi-
fied when dbSNP submissions can be matched to OMIM
records and mutation reports in the biomedical literature.
Entrez SNP supports searches for SNPs lying between two
markers and batch downloads.
Reference sequences (RefSeq). The Reference Sequence
(RefSeq) database (3), provides curated references for tran-
scripts, proteins and genomic regions, plus computationally
derived nucleotide sequences and proteins. The complete
RefSeq database is provided in the RefSeq directory on the
NCBI FTP site. The number of sequences in RefSeq has
grown by 46% over the past year. As of Release 18, RefSeq
contained over 4.1 million sequences, including >2.8 million
protein sequences, representing almost 3695 organisms.
Tools for gene-level analysis
Open reading frame finder (ORF). ORF finder performs a
six-frame translation of a nucleotide sequence and returns
the location of each ORF within a specified size range.
Translations of the ORFs detected can be analyzed via
BLAST against the standard BLAST or COGs databases.
Splign and Spidey. Splign (25) is a utility for computing
cDNA-to-genomic, or spliced sequence alignments that is
accurate in determining splice sites, tolerant of sequencing
errors and supports cross-species alignments. Splign uses a
version of the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm (26) that
accounts for splice signals in combination with BLAST to
identify possible locations of genes and their copies as well
as to speed up the core dynamic programming. The web ver-
sion of Splign is able to compute and display the spliced
alignment of a transcript sequence to a genomic sequence
of up to 50 Mb in seconds. A standalone version that operates
on longer genomic sequences is found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/sutils/splign/splign.cgi?textpage¼downloads.
Spidey aligns a set of eukaryotic mRNA sequences to
against a single genomic sequence taking into account pre-
dicted splice sites and using one of four splice-site models

(Vertebrate, Drosophila, C.elegans, Plant). Spidey returns
exon alignments, protein translations and a summary showing
the alignment quality and goodness of match to splice junc-
tion patterns for each putative exon.
Electronic PCR. Two types of Electronic PCR (e-PCR) can
be performed from the e-PCR home page at www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/sutils/e-pcr. Forward e-PCR searches for matches to
STS primer pairs in the UniSTS database of almost unist-
snumber markers. Reverse e-PCR is used to estimate the
genomic binding site, amplicon size and specificity for sets
of primer pairs by searching against the genomic and tran-
script databases of A.gambiae, A.thaliana, C.elegans, Danio
rerio, D.melanogaster, H.sapiens, M.musculus and R.norvegi-
cus. To increase sensitivity, Forward e-PCR allows the size of
the primer segment to be matched, and the number of mis-
matches, number of gaps and the size of the STS to be
adjusted. Binaries for several computer platforms, along
with the source code, are available via FTP at ftp.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/pub/schuler/e-PCR.
Web interfaces to OrfFinder, Spidey, Splign and e-PCR are
available via the ‘Tools’ link on the NCBI home page.
RESOURCES FOR GENOME-SCALE ANALYSIS
Databases for genomic analysis
Entrez Genome. Entrez Genome (27) provides access to over
370 complete microbial genomic sequences (120 added over
the past year), >2450 viral genomic sequences (350 added)
and >1050 reference sequences for eukaryotic organelles
(250 added). Over 20 higher eukaryotic genomes are also
included, such as the recent arrival, Macaca mulatta, the rhe-
sus monkey. The Plant Genomes Central web page serves as
a portal to completed plant genomes, to information on plant
genome sequencing projects, or to plant-related resources at
NCBI such as plant Genomic BLAST pages or Map Viewer.
Specialized viewers and BLAST pages, are also available for
eukaryotic organelles and viruses.
Within Entrez Genomes, genomes are chosen from an
alphabetical listing or a phylogenetic tree and can be exam-
ined at increasing levels of detail ranging from a graphical
overview of an entire genome to the level of a single gene.
At the level of a genome or a chromosome, a Coding Regions
display gives the locations coding regions, and the lengths,
names and GenBank identification numbers of the protein
products. An RNA Genes view lists the location and names
for ribosomal and transfer RNA genes. A summary of COG
functional groups is also presented. At the level of a single
gene, links are provided to sequence neighbors for the
implied protein with links to the COGs database.
For complete microbial genomes, pre-computed BLAST
neighbors for protein sequences, including their taxonomic
distribution and links to 3D structures, are given in TaxTables
and PDBTables, respectively. Pairwise sequence alignments
are linked to the Cn3D macromolecular structure viewer
(24) to generate displays of 3D structures coupled to sequence
alignments. The TaxPlot, GenePlot and gMap tools, described
below, are available as links from Genomes displays.
The trace and assembly archives. The Trace Archive is a
rapidly growing database of >1.3 billion sequencing traces.
More than 860 organisms are represented, an increase of
>100 over the past year. The Assembly Archive links the
raw sequence information found in the Trace Archive with
assembly information found in GenBank. An Assembly
Viewer allows displays of multiple sequence alignments as
well as the sequence chromatograms for traces that are part
of assemblies. The Trace Assembly Archives are linked
from the NCBI home page.
Genome Project. The Entrez Genome Project database sup-
plements Entrez Genome by providing an overview of the
status of complete and in-progress large-scale sequencing,
assembly, annotation and mapping projects. Genome Project
links to project data in the other Entrez databases, such as
Entrez Nucleotide and Genome, and to a variety of other
NCBI and external resources. For prokaryotic organisms,
Genome Project indexes a number of characteristics of inter-
est to biologists such as organism morphology and motility;
environmental requirements, such as salinity, temperature
and pH range; oxygen requirements and pathogenicity. The
database allows genome sequencing centers to register their
project early in the sequencing process so that project
data can be linked to other NCBI-hosted data at the earliest
opportunity.
Other resources for genomic analysis
Map Viewer. The NCBI Map Viewer displays genome assem-
blies, genetic and physical markers and the results of annota-
tion and other analyses using sets of aligned maps. The Map
Viewer home page (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/) pro-
vides links to both Map Viewer and Genomic BLAST
pages from a taxonomically organized organism list of
over 45 organisms including H.sapiens, M.musculus and
R.norvegicus. Maps available for display in the Map Viewer
vary by organism but may include cytogenetic maps, physical
maps, maps showing predicted gene models, EST alignments
with links to UniGene clusters, and mRNA alignments used
to construct gene models. Maps from multiple organisms or
multiple assemblies for the same organism can be displayed
in a single view. A feature recently added to the Map Viewer
is the ability to view previous genome builds. The Map
Viewer supports queries using various identifiers such as
gene names or symbols, marker names, SNP identifiers, or
accession numbers. Plant genomes in the Map Viewer can
be queried in tandem using a cross species query page to gen-
erate a display of the chromosome maps from multiple spe-
cies. The Map Viewer can generate a tabular display for
convenient export to other programs and segments of a
genomic assembly may be downloaded using a Download/
View Sequence link. Map Viewer displays link to Entrez
Gene, and to tools such as the Evidence Viewer and Model
Maker. Map Viewer links in the Entrez Links menu for
Gene, Nucleotide or Protein databases provide a convenient
route to display a region of interest.
Model Maker. Model Maker (MM) is used to construct tran-
script models using combinations of putative exons derived
from ab initio predictions or from the alignment of GenBank
transcripts, including ESTs, and RefSeqs, to the NCBI human
genome assembly. Previously observed exon splice patterns

are indicated as guides to model building. Completed models
may be saved locally or analyzed with OrfFinder.
Evidence Viewer. The Evidence Viewer (EV) displays the
alignments to genomic contigs of RefSeq and GenBank tran-
scripts, and ESTs supporting gene models. Mismatches
between transcript and genomic sequences are highlighted.
Exon-by-exon transcript alignments, including flanking
genomic sequence for each exon, are given along with protein
translations. Proteins annotated on the transcript sequences
are shown and mismatches between proteins annotated on
the aligned transcripts are highlighted.
Cancer Chromosomes. Three databases, the NCI/NCBI SKY
(Spectral Karyotyping)/M-FISH (Multiplex-FISH) and CGH
(Comparative Genomic Hybridization) Database, the NCI
Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer
(28), and the NCI Recurrent Chromosome Aberrations in
Cancer databases comprise the new Cancerchromosomes
Entrez database found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
query.fcgi? db¼CancerChromosomes.
Three search formats are available: a conventional Entrez
query, a Quick/Simple search, and an Advanced Search.
The simple search offers a set of menus used to select a
disease site or diagnosis that can be combined with specifica-
tions for a particular chromosomal location and anomaly. The
Advanced Search offers a combination of forms for more
complex queries. Search results may list all cases matching
the query terms, a case-based report, or list each clone or
cell separately, the clone/cell report. Similarity reports
show terms common to a group or records within several
term categories, such as diagnosis or disease site and cytoge-
netic abnormalities, among the selected cases or clones/cells.
TaxPlot, GenePlot and gMap. TaxPlot plots similarities in the
proteomes of two organisms to that of a reference organism
for >580 prokaryotic and 50 eukaryotic genomes. A related
tool, GenePlot, generates plots of protein similarity for a pair
of complete microbial genomes to visualize deleted, trans-
posed or inverted genomic segments.
The ‘gMap’ tool combines the results of pre-computed
whole microbial genome comparisons with on-the-fly
BLAST comparisons clustering genomes with similar nucle-
otide sequences and then represents the pre-computed seg-
ments of similarity graphically. A novel sequence may be
introduced into the display of pre-computed alignments
using an on-the-fly BLAST comparison. Using gMap, one
can quickly navigate from a high-level overview of the simi-
larity between a set of genomes, to a nucleotide-level view of
individual segments of alignment.
Clusters of orthologous groups (COGs). The rapid progress
in sequencing has produced sequences for >370 prokaryotic
genomes comprising >250 species within 145 different taxo-
nomic genera. The COGs database (22), presents a compilation
of orthologous groups of proteins from completely sequenced
organisms. A eukaryotic version, KOGs, is available for seven
organisms including H.sapiens; C.elegans, D.melanogaster
and A.thaliana. Alignments of sequence from COGs have
been incorporated into the CDD described below.
Viral genotyping tools. NCBI offers a web-based genotyping
tool that employs a blastn comparison between a viral
sequence to be subtyped and either a default panel of refer-
ence sequences or a panel provided by the user.
Influenza genome resources. The Influenza Genome Sequenc-
ing Project (IGSP) (29) is providing researchers with a grow-
ing collection of virus sequences essential to the identification
of the genetic determinants of influenza pathogenicity. To
date, the project has generated 12 000 influenza sequences.
NCBI’s new Influenza Virus Resource links the IGSP project
data, via PubMed, to the most recent scientific literature on
influenza as well as to a number of on line analysis tools
and databases. These databases include NCBI’s Influenza
Virus Sequence Database, comprised of 34 000 influenza
sequences in GenBank, and NCBI’s RefSeq database. Using
the tools of the Influenza Virus Resource, researchers can
extend their analyses to the 42 000 influenza protein
sequences, 101 influenza protein structures and 240 influenza
population studies accessible within the biological databases
covered by NCBI’s Entrez system. A recently introduced
online influenza genome annotation tool analyzes a novel
sequence and produces output in a ‘feature table’ format
that can be used by NCBI’s GenBank submission tools
such as ‘tbl2asn’ (1).
RESOURCES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF PATTERNS
OF GENE EXPRESSION AND PHENOTYPES
Resources for the analysis of gene expression
Gene expression omnibus (GEO). The Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) (30) is a data repository and retrieval system
for microarray and other forms of high-throughput molecular
abundance data generated by the scientific community. In
addition to gene expression data, GEO accepts array compara-
tive genomic hybridization (aCGH) data, chromatin immuno-
precipitation on array (ChIP-chip) data, SNP array data and
some proteomic data types. The GEO repository accepts Mini-
mum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)-
compliant data submissions. Several data deposit options and
formats are supported, including web forms, spreadsheets,
XML and Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT). The
repository may be queried from both experiment—(Entrez
GEO DataSets) and gene-centric (Entrez GEO Profiles) per-
spectives. At the time of writing, the repository contains
data from 120 000 hybridization experiments, representing
3 billion individual measurements, derived from 3000
array definitions, and spanning >200 organisms.
GENSAT. GENSAT is a gene expression atlas of the mouse
central nervous system produced with data supplied by the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
GENSAT catalogs images of histological sections of the
mouse brain in which tags, such as enhanced green fluores-
cence protein, have been used to visualize the relative degree
of localized expression for a wide array of genes. Images are
available for the mouse brain at various developmental
stages. GENSAT records link to to Entrez Gene, UniGene,
GEO, PubMed and PubMed Central.
Probe. Nucleic acid probes are molecules that complement
a specific gene transcript or DNA sequence and are useful
in gene silencing, genome mapping and genome variation
analysis. The new Entrez Probedatabase serves as an archive

of probe sequences along with data on their experimental util-
ity. Probe entries indicate the intended experimental applica-
tion and include the experimental results generated using the
probe. Entrez Probe is linked to the scientific literature in
PubMed as well as to Entrez Nucleotide with pre-computed
alignments to RefSeqs providing a bridge to the genomic
information in Entrez Gene.
Resources for the analysis of phenotypes
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). NCBI
provides the online version of the OMIM catalog of human
genes and genetic disorders authored and edited by
Victor A. McKusick at The Johns Hopkins University
(31,32). The database contains information on disease pheno-
types and genes, including extensive descriptions, gene
names, inheritance patterns, map locations, gene polymor-
phisms and detailed bibliographies. The OMIM Entrez
database contains 17 000 entries, including data on
>11 000 established gene loci and phenotypic descriptions.
These records link many important resources, such as
locus-specific databases and GeneTests.
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA). Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) is a database of
genes, inherited disorders and traits in animal species, other
than human and mouse, authored by Professor Frank Nicholas
of the University of Sydney, Australia, and colleagues. The
database contains textual information and references, as well
as links to relevant records from OMIM, PubMed, Entrez Gene.
RESOURCES FOR MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AND PROTEOMICS
Structure databases
The molecular modeling database. The NCBI MMDB, built
by processing entries from the Protein Data Bank (5), is des-
cribed in (33). The structures in the MMDB are linked to seq-
uences in Entrez and to the Conserved Domain Database (6).
The conserved domain database and conserved domain
architecture retrieval tool. The CDD contains >12 000 PSI-
BLAST-derived Position Specific Score Matrices representing
domains taken from the Simple Modular Architecture
Research Tool (SMART) (34), Pfam (35), and from domain
alignments derived from COGs. NCBI’s Conserved Domain
Search (CD-Search) service can be used to search a protein
sequence for conserved domains in the CDD. Wherever possi-
ble CDD hits are linked to structures which, coupled with a
multiple sequence alignment of representatives of the domain
hit, can be viewed with NCBI’s 3D molecular structure viewer,
Cn3D (24), equipped with advanced alignment-building tools
that use the PSI-BLAST and threading algorithms. The Con-
served Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART) allows
searches of protein databases on the basis of a conserved
domain and returns the domain architectures of database pro-
teins containing the query domain. Alignment-based protein
domain information from the CDD and 3D domains from the
MMDB can be searched via the Entrez interface.
PubChem. PubChem is the informatics backbone for the NIH
Roadmap Initiative on molecular libraries. PubChem focuses
on the chemical, structural and biological properties of small
molecules, particularly their application as diagnostic and
therapeutic agents. A suite of three Entrez databases, PCSub-
stance, PCCompound and PCBioAssay, debuted during the
past year to contain the substance information, compound
structures and bioactivity data of the PubChem project. The
databases comprise records for over 12.8 million compounds
with over 8 million unique structures. The PubChem data-
bases link to other Entrez databases such as PubMed and
PubMed Central but also to Entrez Structure and Protein to
provide a bridge between the macromolecules of genomics
and the small organic molecules of cellular metabolism.
Tools supporting proteomics
Blast Link (BLink). BLink displays pre-computed BLAST
alignments to similar sequences for each protein sequence
in the Entrez databases. BLink can display alignment subsets
limited by taxonomic criteria, by database of origin, relation
to a complete genome, membership in a COG (22) or by rela-
tion to a 3D structure or conserved protein domain. BLink
links are displayed for protein records in Entrez as well as
within Entrez Gene reports.
The open mass spectrometry search algorithm. The Open
Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA) (36) is an
efficient search engine for identifying MS/MS peptide spectra
by searching libraries of known protein sequences. OMSSA
assigns significant hits a Expect-value computed in the
same way as the E-value of BLAST. The web interface to
OMSSA, reached via a link from the ‘Tools’ link on the
NCBI home page, allows up to 2000 spectra to be
analyzed in a single session using either the BLAST ‘nr’ or
‘refseq_protein’ sequence libraries for comparison. Stan-
dalone versions of OMSSA for several popular computer
platforms that accept larger batches of spectra and allow
searches of custom sequence libraries can be downloaded at
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omssa/download.htm.
HIV-1/Human protein interaction database. The Division of
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in collaboration
with the Southern Research Institute and NCBI, maintains a
comprehensive HIV Protein-Interaction Database of docu-
mented interactions between HIV-1 proteins, host cell pro-
teins, other HIV-1 proteins, or proteins from disease
organisms associated with HIV or AIDS. Summaries, includ-
ing protein RefSeq accession numbers, Entrez Gene IDs, lists
of interacting amino acids, brief descriptions of interactions,
keywords and PubMed IDs for supporting journal articles are
presented at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/HIVInteractions/
index.html. Interaction summaries are selected using pull
down phrase lists to apply filters, and batches of summaries
may be downloaded. All protein–protein interactions
documented in the HIV Protein-Interaction Database are
listed in Entrez Gene reports in the HIV-1 protein interactions
section.
