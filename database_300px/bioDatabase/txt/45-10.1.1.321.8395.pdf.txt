During the past few years Archaea have been recognized as a widespread and significant component of
marine picoplankton assemblages and, more recently, the presence of novel archaeal phylogenetic lineages has
been reported in coastal marine benthic environments. We investigated the relative abundance, vertical
distribution, phylogenetic composition, and spatial variability of Archaea in deep-sea sediments collected from
several stations in the Atlantic Ocean. Quantitative oligonucleotide hybridization experiments indicated that
the relative abundance of archaeal 16S rRNA in deep-sea sediments (1500 m deep) ranged from about 2.5 to
8% of the total prokaryotic rRNA. Clone libraries of PCR-amplified archaeal rRNA genes (rDNA) were
constructed from 10 depth intervals obtained from sediment cores collected at depths of 1,500, 2,600, and 4,500
m. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences revealed the presence of a complex archaeal population structure,
whose members could be grouped into discrete phylogenetic lineages within the two kingdoms, Crenarchaeota
and Euryarchaeota. Comparative denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile analysis of archaeal 16S rDNA
V3 fragments revealed a significant depth-related variability in the composition of the archaeal population.
More than 50% of the earth’s surface is covered by deep-sea
sediments that are primarily formed through the continual
deposition of particles from the productive ocean surface.
Much of the organic input into the oceanic sediments is recy-
cled by the benthic microbial communities (1). Although sev-
eral recent studies have focused on the characterization of
microbial communities involved in carbon and sulfur cycling in
coastal benthic environments (13, 24, 34, 42, 54), microbial
populations in deep-sea sediments remain poorly studied. This
is particularly true for the Archaea, whose population struc-
ture, global distribution, and possible contribution to post-
depositional diagenesis in deep-sea sediments are virtually un-
known. Molecular studies based on the phylogenetic analysis
of environmentally derived 16S rRNA genes (rDNA) can by-
pass the limitations of culture-dependent approaches and offer
an increasingly comprehensive picture of diversity and distri-
bution of microbial populations (57).
The Archaea are divided into two kingdoms: the Euryarchae-
ota and the Crenarchaeota. The Euryarchaeota was traditionally
considered the more physiologically diverse group. This king-
dom includes the methanogens, which inhabit strictly anaero-
bic niches; the extreme halophiles, which are limited to highly
saline, land-locked water bodies; and some of the thermo-
philes, usually found in close proximity to terrestrial and shal-
low-water hot springs and at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
Until recently, the Crenarchaeota were thought to include an
evolutionarily closely related group of organisms, character-
ized by an extremely thermophilic, sulfur-metabolizing pheno-
type. Recently, a third kingdom, the Korarchaeota, has been
proposed to describe a group of as-yet-uncultivated organisms
whose 16S rRNA sequences have been retrieved from a hot
spring in Yellowstone National Park (5). As a whole, the Ar-
chaea were considered to be confined to specialized environ-
ments, including those at high temperature, high salinity, and
extremes of pH and in strictly anaerobic niches that permit
methanogenesis. Recently, several studies based on the com-
parison of 16S rRNA genes have radically changed our view
of the Archaea, revealing the ubiquitous character of these
microorganisms, which also appear to thrive in aquatic and
terrestrial temperate environments. Crenarchaeal phylotypes
have been found among marine picoplankton (9, 10, 19, 39), in
the gut of a deep-sea holothurian (38), in freshwater sediments
(26, 35, 50), in soil (6, 7, 30), in deep subsurface sediments (8),
in continental shelf anoxic sediments (56), and in moderate-
temperature (15 to 30°C) hydrothermal vent microbial mats
(41). Actively dividing cells of Cenarchaeum symbiosum, a cren-
archaeote inhabiting the tissues of a temperate water marine
sponge, have been recently identified, demonstrating growth of
this organism at temperatures of 10°C (46). Moreover, the
biochemical characterization of a heat-labile DNA polymerase
from C. symbiosum is consistent with the postulated nonther-
mophilic phenotype of this crenarchaeote (51). New lineages
of the Euryarchaeota have also been found among marine
picoplankton (9, 10, 20), in salt marsh sediments (42), in con-
tinental shelf anoxic sediments (56), associated with the diges-
tive tracts of marine fishes (55), and in hydrothermal vent
microbial mats (41). Detailed studies on the distribution of the
planktonic Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota illustrated that
the Euryarchaeota were most abundant in surface waters,
whereas the Crenarchaeota dominated at depth (36, 37). Ad-
ditional evidence demonstrating the wide distribution of Ar-
chaea in oxic and anoxic marine sediments and in the water
column has been obtained by using either lipids as biological
markers for the detection of these microorganisms (11, 25, 27).

have been used to quantify Archaea in marine sediments from
the Arctic Ocean (49).
Based on our previous report of novel Archaea in continen-
tal shelf sediments (56), we assessed the vertical distribution
and phylogenetic diversity of Archaea in deep-sea sediments
collected from several locations in the northwestern Atlantic
Ocean. Phylogenetic analyses of archaeal rDNA sequences
were used in combination with rRNA-targeted probe hybrid-
ization to nucleic acid extracts and denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified rDNA
fragments. We report here a high diversity of novel crenar-
chaeal and euryarchaeal phylotypes associated with deep-sea
sediments, whose relative abundance ranged from about 2.5 to
8% of the total prokaryotic rRNA. These results may reflect a
rich physiological diversity associated with Archaea in deep-sea
sediments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection. Deep-sea sediments were collected from different locations
in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean (Table 1). Acrylic tube cores were collected
on the continental rise (CR) at the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory 2500
(LEO 2500), from the DSV Alvin (dives 3075 to 3084) at an average depth of
2,600 m. Surface-deployed box corers operated from the R/V Oceanus were
collected on the Atlantis Canyon (AC; 1,500 m) and on the abyssal plain (AP;
4,500 m). The top 6 to 10 cm of the sediment were soft and showed signs of
bioturbation, whereas below 10 cm the sediment appeared to be thicker and
undisturbed. In situ measurements taken from the DSV Alvin at LEO 2500 (CR)
indicated that oxygen was completely depleted within 5 cm in the sediment (23a),
whereas laboratory measurements indicated that the depth of oxygen depletion
in the AC sediment was 1.0 cm (53a). In situ temperatures of ca. 2°C were
recorded at the CR sites. Subcores were taken at different depth intervals by
using sterile syringes modified by the removal of end flanges. The subcores
were frozen on board and kept at 280°C until they were processed in the
laboratory.
RNA extraction and quantitative oligonucleotide hybridization. Total RNA
was extracted from 3.5 g of each sediment subcore. Aliquots (0.3 g) of sediment
were transferred on ice to screw-cap Eppendorf tubes containing 350 ml of
low-pH buffer (250 mM NaC2H3O2, 50 mM EDTA; pH 5.1), 500 ml of phenol
(pH 5.1), 35 ml of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 0.5 g of zirconium beads
(Biospec, Inc., Bartlesville, Okla.). The RNA was extracted by two bead-beating
treatments and two extractions with phenol (pH 5.1), phenol-chloroform-isoamyl
alcohol (50:49:1), and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1), respectively. The RNA
was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol and was collected by centrifugation,
washed in 80% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in RNase-free sterile distilled
water. A plasmid containing clone CRA7-0 cm was linearized with BamHI and
in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La
Jolla, Calif.) to generate archaeal reference rRNA, and the integrity of the
transcript was checked on a denaturing agarose gel. The sediment RNAs and the
RNA standards were serially diluted and denatured in a 0.5% glutaraldehyde
solution containing polyriboadenylic acid (0.5 mg/ml), applied in duplicate or
triplicate to nylon membranes (Microcon Separations, Inc., Westboro, Mass.)
with a slot-blotting apparatus, and then immobilized by baking at 80°C for 2 h.
Membranes were preincubated in prehybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 50 mM
NaH2PO4 [pH 7.2], 5.0 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 103 Denhardt’s solution) at 40°C
for 1 h and then hybridized in the presence of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide
probes at 40°C overnight. Membranes were washed twice in wash solution (13 SSC
[0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate {pH 7.0}], 1% SDS) at 40°C for 1 h, followed
by two 15-min washes at 44°C (S-*-Univ-1390-a-A-18) (62), 54°C (S-D-Bact-0338-
a-A-18) (3), or 56°C (S-D-Arch-0915-a-A-20) (2). The intensity of the hybridization
signal was measured with a PhosphorImager (model 400S; Molecular Dynamics,
Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.) and quantified relative to Escherichia coli RNA and in
vitro-transcribed archaeal reference rRNA (CRA7-0 cm). Calculations for total
prokaryotic rRNA were based on the sum of detected bacterial and archaeal rRNA.
DNA extraction, amplification, library construction, and screening. Genomic
DNA was extracted from 3.5 g of each deep-sea sediment subcore. Each sample
was thawed on ice, resuspended in 10 ml of extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl
[pH 8.0], 100 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 100 mM Na2HPO4 [pH 8.0], 1.5 M NaCl), and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min with vigorous shaking. Then, 100 mg of lysozyme
(100 mg/ml), 100 ml of pronase (20 mg/ml), and 80 ml of mutanolysin (5,000
U/ml) were added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 h
with gentle shaking. Next, 50 ml of proteinase K was added to the mix followed
by incubation at 37°C for 30 min and at 55°C for 30 min and then by the addition
of 1.5 ml of 20% SDS and 1 ml of 20% N-laurylsarcosine. The sample was
incubated at 65°C for 2 h and slowly rotated. The sample was extracted twice with
an equal volume of phenol, twice with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-
isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1), and twice with an equal volume of chloroform-isoamyl
alcohol (24:1). The aqueous phase was precipitated with 0.6 volumes of isopro-
panol at room temperature for 1 h. The DNA was collected by centrifugation,
washed in cold 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in sterile distilled water,
and the DNA concentration was measured spectrophotometrically. The 16S
rRNA gene sequences were selectively amplified from the genomic DNA by
PCR by using primers designed to anneal to the conserved positions of the 59 and
39 regions of 16S rRNA genes. Primers used to selectively amplify archaeal 16S
rRNA genes were as follows: S-D-Arch-0025-a-S-17 (59-CTGGTTGATCCTGC
CAG-39) (48) or S-D-Arch-0344-a-S-20 (59-ACGGGGCGCAGCAGGCGCGA-
39) (47) with S-*-Univ-1517-a-A-21 (59-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-39)
(58) to yield full-length or 1,120-bp PCR products, respectively. Primers S-D-
Arch-0025-a-S-17 and S-*-Univ-0907-a-A-20 (59-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT
TT-39) (4) were also used to amplify PCR products of ca. 900 bp. Serial dilutions
of template DNA were incubated in a thermal cycler in the presence of Taq DNA
polymerase for 40 cycles under the following conditions: 94°C for 30 s, 48°C for
30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. PCR products were gel purified by using QIAquick spin
columns (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, Calif.) and resuspended in sterile distilled
water. Amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments were cloned in either pCRII plasmid
vector (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.) or pMOS Blue T-vector (Amersham
International, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), and the resulting ligation prod-
ucts were used to transform competent E. coli INVaF9 cells. Ten 16S rDNA
environmental libraries were constructed from different sediment samples (Table
1), and a total of 209 randomly chosen colonies were analyzed for insert-con-
taining plasmids by direct PCR followed by gel electrophoresis of the amplified
products.
RFLP, sequence, and phylogenetic analyses. Insert 16S rDNA fragments were
digested with the tandem tetrameric restriction endonuclease pairs, HaeIII and
HpaII (Promega, Inc., Madison, Wis.). The reaction products were visualized by
electrophoresis on a 2.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5
mg/liter). Representative clones for each library showing unique restriction frag-
ment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns were selected, and their sequences
were determined for both strands on an ABI 373 Automated Sequencer (Ap-
plied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). The average numbers of nucleotides of
sequence determined were 1,300 for the CR and AP clones and 820 for the AC
clones. Sequences were submitted to the CHECK_CHIMERA program at the
Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (33) to detect the presence of chimeric
artifacts and were manually aligned to 16S rRNA sequence data from the RDP

and recent GenBank releases by using the Genetic Data Environment multiple
sequence editor. Environmental and cultivated members of the domains Ar-
chaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya were included in the alignment. The conserved
sequence regions and the established secondary structure of the 16S rRNA were
used as guides to ensure that only homologous nucleotides were compared.
Approximately 1,204 homologous nucleotides were used to infer the phyloge-
netic position of the benthic Archaea. Shorter environmental sequences available
from the database were later added to the alignment and the phylogenetic
analyses were repeated. The addition of shorter sequences did not alter the
topology of the tree. Evolutionary distances were computed from pairwise sim-
ilarities by using the correction of Jukes and Cantor (29). Distance trees were
constructed by the least-squares algorithm of DeSoete (12) from a normal evo-
lutionary distance matrix. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed by using
fastDNAml (15, 17), which uses the generalized two-parameter model of evolu-
tion (32), and by using jumbled orders for the addition of taxa to avoid potential
bias introduced by the order of sequence addition. The transition/transversion
ratio was optimized, and bootstrap analysis was used to provide confidence
estimates for phylogenetic tree topologies (16).
DGGE. A nested-PCR approach was used to amplify the variable region 3
(V3) of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene. The full-length archaeal 16S rDNA was
amplified from the genomic DNA as described above. The PCR products were
gel purified and used as a template to amplify the V3 region by using the
GC-clamp primer 344F(GC) (59-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGTCCCG
CCGCCCCCGCCACGGGGCGCAGCAGGCGCGA-39) and S-*-Univ-0518-a-
A-17 (59-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-39) (43). DGGE was performed with a D
Gene System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). PCR samples (12.0 ml)
were applied directly onto 6% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels in 13 TAE (40 mM
Tris, 20 mM acetate, 1 mM EDTA), with denaturant gradient from 20 to 60%
(where 100% denaturant contains 7 M urea and 40% formamide). Electrophore-
sis was performed at a constant voltage of 200 V and a temperature of 60°C for
6 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated for 15 min in ethidium
bromide (0.5 mg/liter), rinsed for 10 min in distilled water, and photographed
with a UV Foto Analyst system (Fotodyne, Inc., Hartland, Wis.). DGGE bands
were gel purified and reamplified. The PCR products of the second amplification
were loaded onto a DGGE gel to check the purity of the bands, and the sequence
was determined for both strands.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequences from this study
are available through GenBank under accession numbers AF119123 to
AF119147.
RESULTS
Depth-related abundance of Archaea in AC sediments. The
relative contributions of bacterial and archaeal rRNA to the
total prokaryotic community were estimated by slot blot hy-
bridization. The total RNA was extracted from AC 1-cm sed-
iment sections at depth intervals of 0, 4, 6, 8, and 16 cm. AC
sediment was dominated by Bacteria at all depth intervals,
comprising at least 92% of the prokaryotic rRNA. The relative
contribution of Archaea was 2.5 and 2.4% at 0 and 4 cm,
respectively, 5.7 and 7.9% at 6 and 8 cm, respectively, and
decreased to 3.5% at 16 cm (Fig. 1).
DNA extraction, PCR amplification of 16S rDNA, and li-
brary construction. Genomic DNA was extracted from a total
of 10 depth intervals obtained from sediments collected at four
sampling stations (Table 1). The concentration of DNA ex-
tracted from AP sediment was about half that extracted from
CR sediment (data not shown). Furthermore, as the depth in
the sediment increased, we observed a consistent decrease in
the yield of the genomic DNA. Overall, the observed decrease
in DNA yield suggested a decrease in biomass at deeper in-
tervals in the sediment. Two archaeon-specific and two univer-
sal primers were used in different combinations to amplify the
archaeal 16S rDNAs (see Materials and Methods) and to max-
imize the number of different sequences obtained. A 16S
rDNA clone library was constructed for each depth interval
(Table 1), and a total of 163 insert-containing clones were
identified by direct PCR screening.
Vertical profiling of archaeal 16S rDNA by RFLP analysis.
To estimate the depth-related diversity of Archaea in deep-sea
sediments, a total of 128 rDNA clones were selected from
different depth intervals and subjected to RFLP analysis.
RFLP analysis revealed a striking depth-related pattern in
archaeal rDNA diversity. The apparent diversity increased as
the depth in the sediment increased. Details of the frequency
of the RFLP pattern for 61 clones isolated from six depth
intervals from AP and CR-1 sediments are shown in Fig. 2. Of
the 25 unique RFLP patterns detected in these samples, pat-
terns 2 and 3 were most abundant (33.1 and 18.6%, respec-
tively), and they were found predominantly in the 0- to 2-cm
depth interval. RFLP patterns 2 and 3 were also detected in
the 11- to 13-cm depth intervals of both AP (1.6 and 3.2%,
respectively) and CR-1 (10 and 1.6%, respectively) sediments.
The distribution of RFLP patterns 1 and 4 was also limited to
the 0- to 2-cm interval, but at significantly lower frequencies
(1.6 and 3.2%, respectively). The remaining 21 unique RFLP
patterns were only recovered from within or below the 11- to
13-cm interval, at frequencies ranging from 1.6 to 4.9% (Fig.
2). In particular, patterns 10 to 16 were detected exclusively in
the AP sediment at the 15- to 17-cm interval, and patterns 19
to 25 were detected only in the CR-1 25- to 27-cm interval.
Results from the RFLP analysis of the CR-2 sediments col-
lected during DSV Alvin dive 3080 (Table 1) were consistent
with the data shown in Fig. 2, whereas we detected significantly
less diversity in the AC sediments (0 to 2 and 7 to 9 cm; data
not shown).
Population structure and phylogenetic analysis of benthic
Archaea. The sequence of representatives for each library (to-
tal, 41 clones) was determined. No chimeric molecules were
detected in the 0- to 2-cm intervals, whereas potential chimeric
artifacts (ca. 12%) were recognized in some of the deeper
intervals and were excluded from further analysis. In order to
obtain an accurate description of the phylogenetic relation-
ships of the deep-sea benthic Archaea, we included in our
analysis representatives of most of the environmental archaeal
sequences available from the database, as well as sequences of
archaeal isolates. Phylogenetic analyses that used the maxi-
mum likelihood and distance matrix methods revealed the
presence of six clusters of archaeal sequences in deep-sea sed-
iments (Fig. 3). Of the sequenced clones (Fig. 4), 63% grouped
with the strongly supported monophyletic marine group I,
which includes all the nonthermophilic marine planktonic Cren-

archaeota described to date (9, 10, 19) (Fig. 3). Most (57%) of
the marine group I-related benthic clones were isolated from
the 0- to 9-cm intervals, whereas only 6% of the clones were
isolated from the 11- to 13-cm intervals, and none came from
the deeper intervals (Fig. 4). The remaining five clusters of
sequences were not affiliated with any of the previously de-
scribed archaeal planktonic lineages, namely, marine groups I,
II, and III (9, 10, 19, 20), and they were grouped as indepen-
dent clusters (Fig. 3). The average 16S rRNA sequence diver-
gence between representatives of each cluster was 20 to 30%,
a result similar to the typical sequence divergence values found
between bacterial divisions (28), and each cluster exhibited
unique group-specific signature sequences (Table 2). Thus,
they have been designated as marine benthic Archaea groups A
to E.
Phylogenetic analysis placed the marine benthic groups A,
B, and C within the Crenarchaeota, whereas groups D and E
were placed within the Euryarchaeota (Fig. 3). Group A (ca.
9% of the sequenced clones) is a cluster of sequences whose
closest relatives (represented by FFSB1) were isolated from
forest soil (30) and are specifically affiliated with a putative
thermophilic clone (pSL12 in Fig. 3) isolated from a hot spring
in Yellowstone National Park (5) (Fig. 3). Group A sequences
were isolated from sediment depth intervals ranging from 0 to
17 cm (Fig. 4). Group B shares a common ancestry with two
other marine benthic lineages previously isolated (56) and is
represented by a cluster of closely related sequences (13% of
the sequenced clones) that were isolated from both the AP and
the CR, at intervals ranging from 11 to 27 cm (Fig. 3 and 4).
The two lineages closely related to group B include clones
previously isolated from continental shelf anoxic sediment
(BBA 2, 4, and 6) (56) and freshwater sediment (pGrfB286)
(26). The two group C clones (6%) were isolated from the
deepest interval (25 to 27 cm) of the CR sediment and are
closely related to a putative thermophilic clone (pSL17 in Fig.
3) isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park (5).
Group C forms a paraphyletic group with a larger cluster of
sequences isolated from freshwater anoxic sediments (26, 50),
from deep subsurface paleosol (8), and from high-temperature
environments (5) (Fig. 3). The branching topology of marine
benthic groups A, B, and C was supported by high bootstrap
values (see Fig. 6). The affiliation of marine benthic groups A,
B, and C and group I-like lineage with the Crenarchaeota was
confirmed by an intradomain nucleotide signature analysis (59)
(Table 2). However, the presence of A-U at positions 504 and
541 is a feature common to all the deep-sea members of
benthic groups A, B, and C, one not found in the marine group
I lineage (Table 2).
Marine benthic group D consists of a cluster of closely re-
lated sequences affiliated with the Euryarchaeota, all of which
were isolated from subsurface marine sediments (Fig. 3 and 4).
This group includes a clone isolated from the 27-cm interval of
the CR sediment and a group of clones previously isolated
from continental shelf anoxic sediment (BBA) (56) and salt
marsh subsurface sediment (MT) (42). Marine benthic group
D and marine planktonic groups II and III all share a common
ancestry with the aerobic moderate thermophile, Thermo-
plasma acidophilum (Fig. 3). Group E appears to be a mono-
phyletic group of sequences isolated from CR and AP sedi-
ments (11- to 17-cm intervals) (Fig. 3) and represents 9% of
the clones sequenced (Fig. 4). None of the group E clones
appeared to be specifically related to any known archaeal iso-
late, although their phylogenetic position between members of
the Methanobacteriales and the Methanosarcinales suggests a
possible methanogenic phenotype. The intradomain signature
analysis of groups D and E confirmed their affiliation with the
Euryarchaeota and revealed the presence of G-U at positions
513 and 538 as a feature common to all members of marine
benthic group D (Table 2).
DGGE profiling. To further investigate the depth-related
distribution and spatial variability of the benthic Archaea, we
analyzed the DGGE profiles of PCR-amplified fragments of
the archaeal 16S rDNA V3 region from each depth interval of
both the CR-1 and CR-2 cores (Fig. 5). Sixteen dominant
bands, each representing a putative organism, were sequenced,
and their phylogenetic affiliation was inferred by analyzing the
nucleotide signatures contained in the region between posi-
tions 500 and 518 (E. coli numbering) (Table 3). According to
FIG. 2. RFLP pattern distribution for 61 16S rDNA clones isolated from different vertical depth intervals from the AP and CR-1 sediments (4,500- and 2,616-m
depths, respectively).

our analysis, the 16 sequences could be grouped into seven
categories, each category containing sequences that shared
identical signature features (Table 3). Bands a, m, and j were
the only sequences to show crenarchaeal signature features,
and they shared signature nucleotides with the marine benthic
group B. Bands a and m were detected in the upper sediment
of both CR-1 and CR-2 (0 to 2 cm), whereas band j was only
detected in CR-2 (21 to 23 cm).
Bands i and p were of uncertain affiliation, whereas all of the
bands that fell in the remaining categories showed eury-
archaeal features. In particular, bands in category 3 shared
their nucleotide signatures with group D, with the only excep-
tion of position 501, and bands in categories 4 and 5 shared
their nucleotide signatures with group E, with the exception of
position 501 for band e. The putative euryarchaeal band k was
detected both in CR-1 (11 to 13 cm) and in CR-2 (21 to 23 cm)
but disappeared in the CR-1 deeper horizon (25 to 27 cm) (Fig.
5). Bands e and n, whose signature sequences were also eu-
ryarchaeal, were detected in both the deeper horizons of CR-1
and CR-2 cores (25 to 27 cm and 21 to 23 cm, respectively),
although the intensity of band e appeared to be significantly
higher in CR-1 (25 to 27 cm) (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
Quantification of the benthic archaeal community. Al-
though Archaea have been detected at up to 30% of total
rRNA in marine picoplankton (10), in most cases the total
contribution of this group is between 1 and 12% (9, 36, 49).
Using quantitative probe hybridization, we estimated that the
archaeal contributions in AC sediment ranged from 2.4 to
7.9% of the total prokaryotic 16S rRNA, a finding consistent
with previous measurements in marine environments. The
depth-related profiles of archaeal 16S rRNA abundances in
sediments appear to vary depending on the study site. Archaea
have been found to be more abundant in the oxic region of
Lake Michigan sediments (35), whereas a general increase in
archeal abundance in the deeper, anoxic regions have been
documented in permanently cold marine sediments from the
Arctic Ocean (49). Our data provide a preliminary estimate of
the abundance of the archaeal 16S rRNA in deep-sea sedi-
ments. The precise quantification of the relative contributions
and spatial distributions of each group of the benthic Archaea
will require the design of group-specific probes based on
unique consensus sequences.
Our results from hybridization experiments of RNA ex-
tracted from CR and AP sediments were not consistent (data
not shown) and suggested that the RNA concentrations in
these samples were below the detection threshold for the
method. The limited amount of nucleic acids available in low
biomass environments, such as oligotrophic deep-sea sedi-
ments, may be a limitation in quantitative analyses of micro-
organisms in situ (8), the detection threshold for nucleic acid
hybridizations being approximately 105 to 106 target molecules
(53).
Diversity of the benthic Archaea: ecological implications.
Our study showed that the benthic Archaea could be phyloge-
netically assigned to six different groups, each of them identi-
fiable by group-specific signature sequences. The average in-
tergroup 16S rRNA sequence identities, measured between
representatives of each defined group, were low, ranging from
70.2 to 76.8%. Overall, these data show that the benthic Ar-
chaea are phylogenetically diverse and suggest that each group
is likely to represent ecologically distinct populations (45). For
instance, most of the sequences recovered from the upper-
sediment horizons were grouped with the marine group I
planktonic Archaea, whereas groups B and D included se-
quences recovered from deeper, anoxic sediments, both from
coastal and deep-sea sites.
In some instances we detected small clusters of very closely
related sequences, such as the CRA4-23cm cluster within
group B and the ACA17-9cm cluster within group I (Fig. 3),
with sequence identities ranging from 97.1 to 99.1%. Although
microheterogeneity may be attributed to multiple, nonidentical
rRNA operons occurring within the same species, all members
of the Crenarchaeota characterized to date contain only one
rRNA operon (22). Furthermore, two closely related but dis-
tinct variants of the crenarchaeon C. symbiosum exhibited
,0.7% sequence divergence in their rRNA genes (52). Over-
all, these data suggest that microheterogeneity among crenar-
chaeal 16S rRNA genes reflects authentic organismal genetic
diversity. Microheterogeneity among closely related 16S rRNA
sequences have been reported frequently in environmental
surveys of microbial diversity (20, 23, 36, 39, 40, 52). Combin-
ing physiological and phylogenetic data, several studies linked
molecular microdiversity to niche adaptation in marine cya-
nobacteria and suggested that small-scale diversity in 16S
rRNA genes (in the order about 2% sequence divergence)
probably represents adaptive radiation of species (18, 21, 40).

DGGE profiling reveals a complex euryarchaeal community.
Comparative DGGE analysis of the benthic archaeal 16S
rDNAs in different samples revealed a relatively higher com-
plexity in the community structure of the deeper sediment
horizons than in that of the surface sediments (Fig. 5). Direct
comparison of the DGGE profiles from CR-1 and CR-2 at 0 to
2 cm (located about 50 miles apart on the CR) showed a
significant variability in the composition of the rDNA frag-
ments between the two sampling stations (Fig. 5).
Although DGGE only provided limited phylogenetic infor-
mation, signature nucleotides in the V3 region of the 16S
rDNA allowed us to infer the phylogenetic affiliation of most
of the sequenced DGGE fragments (Table 3). Sequence anal-
ysis of the DGGE bands revealed that 11 of the 16 bands
exhibited euryarchaeal signature sequences.
The presence of Euryarchaeota in marine sediments was not
unexpected. Methanogenic Archaea are prevalent in sulfate-
limited sediments, where sulfate-reducing bacteria are not
competitors. However, even in sulfate-rich marine sediments
methanogenesis may occur because some methanogens can
use noncompetitive substrates that are inaccessible to sulfate
reducers (44). Although none of the euryarchaeal sequences
detected in this study were specifically related to any known
methanogen, most of them were recovered from the deep,
anoxic regions of the sediments, which suggests a specific as-
sociation of these microorganisms with anaerobic microhabi-
tats (Fig. 4 and 5). In three instances Euryarchaeota were also
detected in surface sediments (bands h, l, and o), where an-
aerobic microniches may be associated with protozoan hosts,
with the fecal pellets of deep-sea animals (38, 55), or with the
sediment itself.
The identification of only three crenarchaeal bands in the
DGGE profiles is not consistent with the wide crenarchaeal
diversity detected with the clone library approach, and it may
be explained by the intrinsic characteristics of universal primer
518R used in this study (43). The last nucleotide at the 39 end
of primer 518R (G) is complementary to position 518 (E. coli
numbering) in the 16S rRNA molecule. This position is a U in
most of the nonthermophilic Crenarchaeota sequenced to date,
whereas it is a C in all marine planktonic and benthic Eury-
archaeota and in the crenarchaeal benthic group B (Table 2)
(9). Thus, the use of primer 518R in the nested-PCR approach
may have failed to detect most of the crenarchaeal diversity,
whereas it provided an in-depth characterization of the com-
plex euryarchaeal populations in deep-sea sediments that
would have otherwise escaped full detection. Our data con-
firmed the extreme sensitivity of the method to the PCR prim-
ers of choice and the possibility to target specific subpopula-
tions within larger microbial communities.
High-temperature ancestry of nonthermophilic Archaea:
evolutionary implications. It has been postulated that the an-
cestral archaeon was an extremely thermophilic anaerobe that
probably derived its energy from the oxidation of molecular
hydrogen and from the reduction of sulfur (60). This hypoth-

esis is corroborated by the apparent slow-evolving pace of
thermophilic Archaea and by their common occurrence near
the base of the rooted 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree (5). How-
ever, nonthermophilic Archaea, particularly marine groups I
and II, appear to evolve faster than their thermophilic relatives
(9).
Consistently with other reports (5, 8, 26), our phylogenetic
analyses revealed that several distinct nonthermophilic crenar-
chaeal sequences were nested within presumptive thermophilic
lineages previously recovered from a hot spring in Yellowstone
National Park (5). In particular, our data revealed that marine
benthic group A was closely related to pSL12 (5) and that
group C was closely related to pSL17 (Fig. 3 and 6). In both
cases these affiliations were sustained by high bootstrap values
(Fig. 6). Furthermore, several other putative thermophilic lin-
eages (pJP89, pSL123, and pSL22) (5) were found to be in
close affiliation with nonthermophilic crenarchaeal clones re-
covered from freshwater sediments (pGrf26, pLAW11, and
pLAW12) (26, 50) and deep subsurface paleosol (Arc.98 and
Arc.168) (Fig. 3) (8). Among the Euryarchaeota, mesophilic
members of the Methanoccales, such as M. voltae and M. mari-
paludis, are placed within the same lineage of their deeper-
rooted thermophilic relative, M. jannaschii (Fig. 3 and 6).
The nesting of nonthermophilic Archaea within thermophilic
lineages implies a high-temperature ancestry for the low-tem-
perature organisms (26). Moreover, the observation that phy-
logenetically distinct nonthermophilic lineages are specifically
affiliated with different thermophilic organisms suggests that
the adaptation to low-temperature environments has arisen
and evolved in several independent instances within the Ar-
chaea, although this conclusion requires further verification.
The presumed evolution of independent low-temperature
adaptive features from distinct thermophilic ancestral lineages
is consistent with the wide phylogenetic diversity of the non-
thermophilic Archaea that we reported here and with their
putative broad ecological and metabolic potential.
