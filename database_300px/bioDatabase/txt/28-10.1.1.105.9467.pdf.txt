ABSTRACT
DBTSS was first constructed in 2002 based on pre-
cise,experimentallydetermined50 endclones.Several
major updates and additions have been made since
the last report. First, the number of human clones has
drastically increased, going from 190 964 to 1 359 000.
Second, information about potential alternative pro-
moters is presented because the number of 50 end
clones is now sufficient to determine several promot-
ers for one gene. Namely, we defined putative pro-
moter groups by clustering transcription start sites
(TSSs) separated by ,500 bases. A total of 8308
human genes and 4276 mouse genes were found to
have putative multiple promoters. Third, DBTSS
provides detailed sequence comparisons of user-
specified TSSs. Finally, we have added TSS informa-
tion for zebrafish, malaria and schyzon (a red algae
model organism). DBTSS is accessible at http://dbtss.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, a huge amount of comprehensive expression profile
data obtained by various experiments, such as microarrays, has
been made available. It is a challenging problem to uncover
the regulatory networks among the expressed genes from these
data. Information about promoters, which contain most of the
binding sites of transcription factors, is indispensable for solv-
ing this question. To define promoter regions, precise informa-
tion about transcription start sites (TSSs) is also required. Such
data, however, are not easily obtained because the cDNA
sequence data in repository sequence databases provide no
guarantees regarding the 50 end of the sequences and because
the computational prediction of promoters and TSSs still
remains problematic (1). To overcome these difficulties
several databases (2), including DBTSS (DataBase of
Transcription Start Sites) have been constructed. DBTSS con-
tains TSS information of genes based on specific experiments
(3,4). Clones constructed by full-length cDNA methods such
as oligo-capping (5,6) or CAP-trapper (7,8) are mapped on to
genome sequences to determine TSSs. Each TSS is determined
based on the 50 end of the corresponding clone. DBTSS was
first constructed in 2002, and has been improved by several
major and minor updates. The original version (version 1)
contained only human data (3). Two years later, we reported
the addition of mouse TSS information (9) in version 3 (4).
Here we introduce the new updates and additions since version
3, the most important one being the addition of putative alter-
native promoter information.
NEW FEATURES
The current version of DBTSS, version 5, includes some
notable improvements since the previous report, in addition
to minor updates such as modifications of the interface and the
result views.
One major improvement is that the amount of data for
human TSSs has been significantly increased: in our report
in 2002, we described 190 964 human clones which corre-
sponded to 11 234 NCBI reference sequence cDNAs (RefSeq)
(4). Because we added data from a new full-length cDNA
project (10), DBTSS now contains 1 359 000 clones corre-
sponding to 19 753 RefSeq cDNAs (Table 1). Since RefSeq
cDNAs contain splicing variants as separate entries, we per-
formed clustering of clones’ information depending on their
coordinate in the genome sequence; if their sequences over-
lapped, we regard them as the same locus. After clustering, our
data correspond to 15 262 genes (Table 1). This is one of the
largest collections of human 50 end cDNA sequences.
To check the quality of our TSS data, we compared DBTSS
with the Eukaryote Promoter Database (EPD) (2). In EPD
Release 82, there are 1871 promoters collected from the
literature. Among them, we could map 1767 promoter

sequences to the human genome; 1639 of them mapping
within 100 bases of the DBTSS TSSs, indicating that the data
in DBTSS are consistent with the data obtained from ordinary
methods.
In the next two sections, we will discuss two other
major updates: alternative promoters (APs) and promoter
comparison.
ALTERNATIVE PROMOTERS
Several genes are known to have multiple promoters which
could be regulated in a different manner. These promoters,
labeled as APs, could be useful to maximally exploit the rela-
tively limited number of genes in the genome (11). However,
no estimation of how many genes might have alternative
promotes is available to date. Since DBTSS now has enough
50 end clones from human and mouse, we performed this
estimate. This is the most important addition in version 5.
Although the details of our analysis will be reported elsewhere
(12), the procedure is summarized below.
To determine APs, we first collected all the TSSs from the
same locus. TSSs located inside a RefSeq gene exon, with the
exception of the first one, were removed in order to avoid
artifacts caused by truncated 50 ends. We used several intervals
to define AP clusters. The distribution of the number of puta-
tive alternative promoter containing genes shows a plateau
before the interval size reaches 500 bp (12). We, therefore,
clustered the clones using a 500 base interval, and defined each
cluster as an promoter. We obtained 30 964 promoters, and
26 784 (86.5%) of them are within 500 bp. According to this
procedure, 6954 human loci and 9886 mouse loci have only
one promoter while 8308 human loci and 4276 mouse loci
have two promoters or more. Figure 1A shows the three alter-
native promoters found in the gene encoding human A kinase

colors; therefore, there are three putative promoters in human AKAP1. We observed several patterns of first exon in promoter type 1, so we clustered them and show
them as ‘First exon variant type A–F’. (B) Comparative analysis between human and mouse alternative promoters. There are two putative promoters in mouse. The
best match between two promoters is available in ‘Promoter Comparison’. (C) Clicking the ‘Comparative View’, the user can obtain the alignment between these

anchor protein 1 (AKAP1). It is notable that DBTSS also
provides comparative information between human and mouse
promoters. Figure 1B shows an example of comparative pro-
moter analysis between orthologous genes. Two promoters
were identified for the mouse gene for AKAP1. From this
view, the representative APs are also available for alignment.
By clicking ‘Comparative View’ in ‘Promoter Comparison’ in
Figure 1B, the LALIGN-based alignment view, shown in
Figure 1C is obtained.
COMPARATIVE PROMOTER ANALYSIS
In the previous section, we showed an example of alternative
promoter comparison between human and mouse. Before
version 5 of DBTSS, these were precomputed, and the user
could only obtain alignments between orthologous human and
mouse genes. Despite being a useful idea, this sometimes
failed to answer the user’s need for alignments of arbitrary
promoter pairs, for instance, promoters of paralogous genes.
We therefore implement a dynamic viewer allowing the align-
ment of any two TSSs present in DBTSS. Such analyses are
necessary to understand how transcriptional regulatory
elements were conserved or diverged during gene and exon
duplication. For example, in Figure 2A, the clones TST01431
of protamine 1 (PRM1: NM_002761) and TST00906 of pro-
tamine 2 (PRM2: NM_002762) are selected for alignment.
Both genes are expressed in testis and are paralogous to
each other. PRM1 is found in nearly all mammals while
PRM2 is observed in relatively few mammals including
human and mouse (13). In human, both genes are on chromo-
some 16, separated by 5 kb (14). The obtained alignment and
the determined conserved regions are shown in Figure 2B. In
this case, the blocks ‘0’ and ‘7’ are highly conserved. The
details of the alignment of both TSS regions are also available,
as shown in Figure 2C. Especially, it is noteworthy that the
putative TATA-box is inside block ‘7’ for the PRM1 promoter
and outside of it for the PRM2 promoters (15).
FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
As shown in Table 1, we have added data from 32 263
zebrafish (Danio rerio) (16), 10 236 malaria (Plasmodium

falciparum) (17) and 22 923 schyzon (Cyanidioscyzon
merolae) (18) 50 end clones. These correspond to 3061
zebrafish, 1527 malaria and 3635 schyzon genes. We will
continue to expand DBTSS by adding TSS information for
other species, such as macaque, when the relevant data become
publicly available. Such data will give us a deeper insight into
how the transcriptional regulatory networks have been shaped
into their current form in humans, in terms of the molecular
evolution of the promoters.
