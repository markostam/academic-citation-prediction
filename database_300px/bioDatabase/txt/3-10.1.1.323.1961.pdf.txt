Abstract We developed an assay that quantitates bidirec-
tional cholesterol flux between cells and lipoproteins. In-
cubating Fu5AH cells with increasing concentrations of
human serum resulted in increased influx and efflux;
however, influx was 2- to 3-fold greater at all serum con-
centrations. With apolipoprotein B (apoB)-depleted serum,
the ratio of influx to efflux (I/E) was close to 1, indicating
cholesterol exchange. The apoB fraction of serum induced
influx and little efflux, with I/E . 1. Using block lipid
transport-1 to block scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-
BI)-mediated flux with different acceptors, we determined
that 50% to 70% of efflux was via SR-BI. With HDL, 90% of
influx was via SR-BI, whereas with LDL or serum, 20% of
influx was SR-BI-mediated. Cholesterol-enriched hepa-
toma cells produced increased efflux without a change in
influx, resulting in reduced I/E. The assay was applied to
cholesterol-normal and -enriched mouse peritoneal macro-
phages exposed to serum or LDL. The enrichment enhanced
efflux without shifts in influx. With cholesterol-enriched
macrophages, HDL efflux was enhanced and influx was
greatly reduced. With all lipoproteins, cholesterol enrich-
ment of murine peritoneal macrophages led to a reduced
I/E. We conclude that this assay can simultaneously and
accurately quantitate cholesterol bidirectional flux and can
be applied to a variety of cells exposed to isolated lipo-
proteins or serum.—Zimetti, F., G. K.Weibel,M. Duong, and

The movement of cholesterol out of cells and onto
extracellular lipoprotein acceptors represents the first step
in the process of reverse cholesterol transport, a pathway
by which excess cholesterol is removed from the periph-
eral tissues and delivered to the liver for excretion (1–3).
Many studies have probed this cholesterol efflux step and
established that a number of mechanisms can mediate the
efflux of free cholesterol (FC). Among these mechanisms
are unmediated aqueous diffusion (4) and pathways me-
diated by scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) (5),
ABCA1 (6), and other ABC transporters, such as the re-
cently discovered ABCG1 and ABCG4 (7). Although there
are multiple efflux mechanisms, the actual measurement
of efflux is relatively simple and usually employs the quan-
titation of the release of radiolabeled FC from cells into
the medium. However, because physiologically relevant
acceptors, such as lipoproteins, contain both FC and
cholesteryl ester (CE), there is a bidirectional movement
of cholesterol between cells and lipoproteins. Whereas the
measurement of cholesterol efflux is relatively simple, the
quantitation of influx of lipoprotein cholesterol is much
more complicated (8). Influx involves the uptake of both
FC and CE and is mediated by several mechanisms, in-
cluding the unmediated uptake of lipoprotein FC via
aqueous diffusion, the internalization of intact lipoprotein
particles delivering both FC and CE, and the SR-BI-
enhanced flux pathways of lipoprotein FC and selective CE
uptake. These flux pathways become even more complex
when cells are exposed to whole serum, in which indi-
vidual lipoproteins and apolipoproteins differentially
contribute to both the efflux and influx of cholesterol.
When cells are incubated with isolated lipoproteins or
whole serum, the net movement of cholesterol mass can
result in the accumulation of cell cholesterol (influx), the
depletion of cell cholesterol (efflux), or the bidirectional
flux of cholesterol without a net change in cholesterol in
either extracellular or intracellular compartments (ex-
change). Net efflux, net influx, and exchange can be de-
termined by several factors, such as the level of cholesterol
in the cells, the expression of receptors on the cell surface,
and the concentration and composition of the lipopro-
teins to which cells are exposed.
Although efflux studies have been very useful in iden-
tifying the different pathways involved in the movement
of cholesterol out of cells, one criticism of this approach
is that the assay does not allow the determination of bi-
directional flux. In this study, we have developed an
assay that, based on a combination of mass and isotopic
determinations, permits the simultaneous quantitation
of both cholesterol efflux and influx when cells are ex-
posed to isolated lipoproteins or whole serum. With this

approach, we have determined the contribution to
cholesterol flux of different serum fractions and whole
serum. Also, we have measured the bidirectional flux of
cholesterol when either Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells or
murine peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) are exposed to
sera or isolated lipoproteins.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials
Tissue culture plasticware was obtained from Falcon (Lincoln,
NJ). RPMI 1640 and MEM were purchased from Mediatech
Cellgro (Herndon, VA). FBS, calf serum (CS), gentamycin,
DNase I, sodium cholate, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
Mevinolin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
BSA was obtained from Serological Corp. (Norcross, GA). [1,2
3H]cholesterol was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Analytical
Sciences (Boston, MA). The ACAT inhibitor CP113,818 was
kindly provided by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals (Groton, CT). The SR-
BI inhibitor BLT-1 (for block lipid transport-1) was obtained
from ChemBridge (San Diego, CA).
Serum lipids and lipoprotein analysis
Human HDL3 and LDL were obtained by sequential ultracen-
trifugation as described previously (for LDL, d5 1.019–1.063; for
HDL, d 5 1.063–1.21) (9). Reconstituted high density lipopro-
tein (rHDL) particles, containing 100:1 (mol/mol) 1-palmitoyl-2-
oleoylphosphatidilcholine/apolipoprotein A-I were prepared
using a cholate dialysis technique (10). Acetylated low density
lipoprotein (acLDL) was obtained by modification of LDL with
acetic anhydride, as described previously (11). The concentra-
tion of all of the lipoproteins used during the experiment was
expressed as Ag protein/ml. Human serum was collected with
approved consent from healthy normolipidemic individuals and
pooled. The apolipoprotein B (apoB)-depleted serum was ob-
tained from the whole serum by precipitating the apoB-contain-
ing lipoproteins with a polyethylene glycol solution as described
previously (12). Briefly, whole serum was incubated for 20 min
with a 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 solution. After spin-
ning samples at 10,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected and
stored at 4jC.
Cell culture
Rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells were maintained in MEM contain-
ing 5% CS. Cells at 90% confluence were trypsinized and plated
at a density of 6 3 105/well on 12-well plates. Cell number was
determined using the Z1 Coulter Particle Counter (Hialeah, FL).
MPMs were isolated from B6CF31 mice. Mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of a 10% solution of Brewer Thio-
glycollate Medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Three days
later, macrophages were harvested by lavage of the peritoneal
cavity with PBS. After spinning and resuspension in MEM-
HEPES, cells were counted and plated in 10% RPMI at a density
of 7 3 105 cells/well on 12-well plates. All media were sup-
plemented with gentamycin.
Preparation of BLT-1 solution
To prepare a stock solution, BLT-1 was dissolved in DMSO at a
concentration of 10 mM. The day before the treatment with cells,
BLT-1 was diluted in 4% BSA-containing medium at a concentra-
tion of 200 AM and stored at 4jC. Just before the addition to cells,
BLT-1 was diluted in medium to a final concentration of 10 AM.
Measurement of cholesterol bidirectional flux
The assay to measure cholesterol efflux and influx uses a
combination of isotopic and mass determinations. Cells were
labeled for 24 h with [3H]cholesterol in medium supplemented
with 2.5% CS. After an equilibration period in 0.2% BSA-con-
taining medium, a set of cells was harvested before the incu-
bation with cholesterol acceptors (time zero) and the cholesterol
content of cell lysates was measured as described below. Total
counts were determined as well, and the specific activity (SA) at
time zero (T0 SA) (cpm/Ag cholesterol) was calculated. The re-
maining cells were incubated with either serum or isolated lipo-
proteins for 8 h, at the end of which cholesterol SA was again
determined (T8 SA). Because the medium volume can affect the
quantitation of cholesterol influx, in all experiments, 0.5 ml of
medium was used in the flux period. To inhibit de novo choles-
terol synthesis, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Mevinolin was
added to the efflux medium at a concentration of 5 Ag/ml (13).
Furthermore, to prevent cholesterol esterification, 2 Ag/ml of
the ACAT inhibitor CP113,818 was added during labeling, equil-
ibration, and the flux stages of the experiment. For the de-
termination of efflux, the following parameters were established:
1) T0 cholesterol content; and 2) fractional efflux. The efflux of
cell cholesterol mass was calculated as fractional efflux 3 T0
cholesterol content, as described previously (14). For influx
determinations, the following terms were used: 1) T0 SA; 2) T8
SA; 3) SA factor (T0 SA/T8 SA); 4) theoretical mass (T0
cholesterol content  the mass of cholesterol effluxed); and
5) calculated mass (SA factor 3 theoretical mass). Influx was
determined as the calculated mass  theoretical mass. Choles-
terol efflux and influx are expressed as Ag cholesterol/8 h/mg
protein. The net cholesterol movement resulting from these two
opposite fluxes are expressed as an influx-to-efflux ratio (I/E).
I/E , 1 indicates net cholesterol efflux, whereas I/E . 1 reflects
net cholesterol influx. Cholesterol exchange without significant
net flux is reflected by I/E 5 1.
Protein and cholesterol determination
At the end of the experiment, cell monolayers were washed
with MEM-HEPES medium and lysed in 0.5 ml of a 1% sodium
cholate solution in water supplemented with 10 U/ml DNase. A
total of 125 Al of a reaction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100,
0.5 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.25 M NaCl, and 1%
sodium cholate was added to the cell lysates, and plates were
shaken for 30 min at room temperature. Care must be taken to
ensure complete solubilization of the cell monolayer. After heat-
ing samples at 60jC for 30 min, to inactivate enzymes that could
compete with the enzymatic cholesterol assay, cholesterol was
measured fluorimetrically using the Amplex Red Cholesterol
Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described by the
manufacturer. Because the experiments were conducted in the
presence of anACAT inhibitor, the cholesterol present in the cells
at T0 was unesterified. However, the enzymatic kit assay for cho-
lesterol included a cholesterol esterase and allowed the measure-
ment of all cellular cholesterol. This permitted the quantitation of
any CE incorporated from lipoproteins. The amount of choles-
terol in each well was measured by comparison with a cholesterol
standard curve included in each experiment. An aliquot of the
cell lysates was also taken to measure cell protein by a modified
Lowry method (15). The total [3H]cholesterol present in cell
lysates was measured by scintillation counting.

RESULTS
We first investigated whether the direction of net
cholesterol flux depends on the type and composition of
the extracellular acceptors. Fu5AH cells were exposed to
isolated lipoproteins or serum for 8 h, and cholesterol
efflux, cholesterol influx, and the I/E were measured. Rat
Fu5AH hepatoma cells express high levels of SR-BI and
thus can be viewed as a cellular system in which SR-BI-
mediated bidirectional flux of cholesterol is of major im-
portance (16). As shown in Table 1, when cells were
exposed to rHDL, there was significant cholesterol efflux
(5.296 0.36 Ag cholesterol/mg protein) in the absence of
influx, as expected, because these particles contain no
cholesterol. With HDL3, cholesterol efflux and influx val-
ues were similar (2.14 6 0.45 and 1.86 6 0.73 Ag cho-
lesterol/mg protein, respectively), with the resulting I/E
of 0.87 6 0.52, indicating that cholesterol was exchanged
between HDL and the hepatoma cells without resulting in
net cholesterol flux. Furthermore, rHDL was a more ef-
ficient cholesterol acceptor than HDL3 when the two
particles were used at similar protein concentrations. In-
cubation of cells for 8 h with 100 Ag/ml LDL resulted in
influx being 4.7-fold greater than efflux, producing net
cholesterol movement into cells (I/E of 4.65 6 0.24). Net
influx was also observed upon exposure of cells to 2.5%
human serum, producing an I/E of 2.15 6 0.29.
It has been proposed that SR-BI enhances aqueous
diffusion, facilitating the bidirectional movement of FC,
and this flux follows the concentration gradients between
cell membranes and extracellular particles (17, 18). Thus,
increasing cell cholesterol content should create a gra-
dient that facilitates the movement of cholesterol out of
cells. The initial cholesterol content in Fu5AH cells was
increased by incubation with 100 Ag/ml LDL added dur-
ing the labeling period (Fig. 1). In a representative ex-
periment, FC content was 20.4 6 1.15 Ag cholesterol/mg
protein for cholesterol-normal cells and 36.5 6 4.78 Ag
cholesterol/mg protein after cholesterol enrichment.
HDL3, LDL, and human serum were then added to the
culture medium for 8 h, and cholesterol efflux and influx
were measured. Cholesterol efflux and influx values for
normal cells were similar to those presented in Table 1.
The fractional release of cholesterol from enriched cells
was similar to that obtained with cholesterol-normal cells.
However, because the cellular FC pool was expanded by
z40%, the mass of FC released to all acceptors was in-
creased, as has been described (19). Although the choles-
terol mass released was increased, no significant change in
cholesterol influx between normal and enriched cells was
observed. Thus, the I/E obtained with enriched Fu5AH

period, and 5 Ag/ml Mevinolin was added during the flux period. Cholesterol efflux, influx, and I/E were calculated as described in Experimental
Procedures. Data are expressed as averages 6 SD.

cells was reduced compared with that in cholesterol-
normal cells.
In vivo, cells are exposed to a mixture of lipoproteins
present in serum. For this reason, further experiments
were performed to measure the bidirectional flux of
cholesterol upon exposure of cells to serum. Figure 2
shows how the mass of cholesterol undergoing efflux or
influx, and the I/E, changed when Fu5AH cells were in-
cubated with increasing concentrations of human serum,
ranging from 2.5% to 12.5%. We also established the
contribution of the apoB-depleted serum and the apoB-
containing lipoproteins to both efflux and influx. To
obtain the apoB-depleted serum, apoB-containing lipo-
proteins of whole serum were precipitated with PEG, as
described in Experimental Procedures. The contribution
of the apoB-containing lipoproteins was calculated by sub-
tracting the flux obtained with PEG supernatant (i.e.,
HDL) from that obtained with serum. The cholesterol
efflux to whole serum (Fig. 2A) increased in a dose-
dependent manner, from 5.33 6 0.16 Ag cholesterol/mg
protein with 2.5% serum to 11.23 6 0.13 Ag choles-
terol/mg protein for the highest dose of serum (12.5%).
Cholesterol influx from serum also increased in a dose-
dependent manner, ranging from 11.15 6 0.89 Ag FC/mg
protein with 2.5% serum to 27.24 6 0.92 Ag FC/mg
protein at 12.5% serum. At every serum concentration,
the mass of cholesterol incorporated into cells was
greater than that released from cells, and this was re-
flected by I/E . 1, which increased linearly with in-
creasing serum concentrations (Fig. 2B). After isolating
the apoB-depleted fraction, theHDL- and apoB-containing
lipoprotein contributions to efflux and influx were
calculated. As shown in Fig. 2C, the apoB-depleted frac-
tion was responsible for values ranging from 55% to 79%
of the total amount of cholesterol released from cells
(compare Fig. 2C with 2A). Furthermore, for every con-
centration of apoB-depleted serum, the I/E was some-
what ,1. This indicated once again that HDL promoted
either a small net efflux or exchange of cholesterol. By the
difference between the whole serum and the apoB-
depleted serum, we determined the ability of the apoB-
containing lipoprotein component of serum to promote
both efflux and influx. Figure 2E shows how this fraction
made only a small contribution to cholesterol efflux, and
the amount of cholesterol released was independent of the
concentration of serum. As expected, the VLDL and LDL
components of the serum were the major source of
cholesterol for influx, with maximum values of 19.20 6
1.38 Ag cholesterol influx/mg protein with 12.5% serum.
Moreover, apoB lipoproteins mediated 70–80% of the
total cholesterol taken up by cells (compare Fig. 2E with
2A). Net cholesterol influx, expressed by the I/E, in-
creased linearly with the serum concentration, as shown
in Fig. 2F.
In the experiments described above, we used a flux
period of 8 h to permit the quantitation of detectable
cholesterol movement in and out of cells. To test whether
cholesterol efflux, influx, and the resulting I/E changed

with different flux times, we exposed Fu5AH cells to 2.5%
whole serum for 4, 8, and 12 h, and at the end of the
incubation times we measured both cholesterol efflux and
influx. The results are shown in Fig. 3. For each time point,
influx was greater than efflux and the I/E was .1, with
ratios ranging from 3.00 to 3.92, indicating that time did
not affect the direction of the net flux, at least over 12 h.
Cholesterol movement in Fu5AH cells is mainly at-
tributable to a high expression of SR-BI; however, other
pathways can be involved. To quantitate the contribution
of SR-BI and other mechanisms to the bidirectional flux,
we incubated Fu5AH cells with BLT-1, a low molecular
weight compound capable of inhibiting lipid transport
mediated by SR-BI (20). Fu5AH cells were treated with
10 AM BLT-1 for 2 h before cholesterol acceptors were
added. The results of cholesterol efflux and influx, in the
absence or presence of BLT-1, are shown in Fig. 4A, B.
BLT-1 inhibited HDL3-mediated efflux by 54%, indicating
that approximately half of the efflux from Fu5AH cells to
HDL3 occurred via SR-BI (Fig. 4A). Cholesterol influx was
inhibited by 87% in BLT-1-exposed cells (Fig. 4B). Ex-
posing cells to LDL after BLT-1 treatment caused a re-
duction in cholesterol efflux of 67% (Fig. 4A), and the
effect on influx was significant but modest (20%; Fig. 4B).
In the presence of human serum as an acceptor, BLT-1
inhibition of efflux was 57%; the reduction in influx was
only 20%. The apoB-depleted portion of the serum gave a
flux pattern similar to that of isolated HDL3, withz50% of
the efflux mediated by SR-BI and a much greater fraction
of influx linked to SR-BI (z90%). I/E values in the pres-
ence or absence of BLT-1 are shown in Table 2. With
isolated HDL3 and apoB-depleted serum, inhibition of
SR-BI reduced influx to a greater extent than efflux,
resulting in a reduction in I/E. However, this pattern was
reversed with serum and LDL, in which case the inhibition
of SR-BI resulted in a greater reduction in efflux. This
caused increases in I/E.
These bidirectional flux data were obtained with Fu5AH
hepatoma cells expressing high levels of SR-BI, which me-
diates large amounts of cholesterol movement in and out
of cells. We extended the assay to cholesterol-normal and
cholesterol-enriched MPMs by incubation with 100 Ag/ml
acLDL (Fig. 5). The initial cholesterol content of choles-
terol-normal cells was 21.84 6 1.85 Ag cholesterol/mg
protein, and that in cholesterol-enriched cells was 40.206

4.04 Ag cholesterol/mg protein. Macrophages were incu-
bated with HDL3, human serum, LDL, and acLDL. The
results obtained for efflux and influx were generally sim-
ilar to those observed in Fu5AH cells, with an increase in
efflux of cholesterol mass after enrichment and no sig-
nificant changes in cholesterol influx upon cell loading.
However, results obtained by incubation with HDL3 were
different from those with serum and LDL in that after
loading, the I/E was dramatically reduced because of in-
creased efflux and almost totally abolished influx. Using
macrophages, we were also able to compare the difference
between LDL and acLDL on flux. Because macrophages
have high expression levels of the scavenger receptor
SR-A, we anticipated enhanced influx with acLDL (21, 22).
We observed that the amount of cholesterol released to
acLDL was comparable to that released to the same con-
centration of LDL (Fig. 5). However, cholesterol influx
promoted by acLDL was z2-fold greater than influx
promoted by LDL in both unloaded and loaded cells.
Thus, as predicted, more efficient uptake occurred in the
presence of acLDL. The I/E of 4.41 6 0.25 in unloaded
cells was reduced to 1.52 6 0.30 after cholesterol enrich-
ment of MPMs. This was exclusively attributable to a
marked increase in efflux (63%), without any change in
the amount of cholesterol delivered to cells.
DISCUSSION
Bidirectional flux assay
One aim of these studies was to develop a reliable assay
that could quantitate the bidirectional flux of cholesterol
between cells and lipoproteins and to design the assay so
that it could be applied to a large number of samples with
relative ease. Many studies have measured the efflux of
cellular cholesterol from a number of different cells to a
variety of extracellular acceptors (7, 16, 23, 24). In most of
these studies, the efflux of cell cholesterol was quantitated
through the release of radiolabeled cholesterol from cells
prelabeled with either exogenous or endogenous choles-
terol (8). Although cholesterol efflux can bemediated by a
number of different mechanisms, the high-throughput
measurement of isotopic release of cholesterol is accurate
because only FC undergoes efflux. In contrast to efflux,
the measurement of influx of cholesterol by cells from
lipoproteins is more complicated, because both FC and CE
are incorporated by a number of different mechanisms.
Bidirectional flux of cholesterol has been measured in
a limited number of studies, primarily using a double-
labeled approach in which the cells are labeled with
[3H]FC and the lipoprotein is labeled with [14C]FC (25).
However, this approach measures only the flux of FC. The
protocol we used in this study uses the release of labeled
cell cholesterol to quantitate efflux and the dilution of cell
cholesterol specific activity to assess cholesterol influx.
This approach includes the uptake of both exogenous FC
and CE and is independent of mechanism of influx, cell
growth, or cell loss during the incubations. One of the
features of the assay is that it includes the addition of the
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to avoid any interference in
the measurement related to de novo cholesterol synthesis.
Even if we do not think that in 8 h there is substantial
cholesterol synthesis, we choose to keep the inhibitor

present during the flux period to exclude any residual
endogenous synthesis from the quantitation. The pres-
ence of the ACAT inhibitor during the experiment is more
important. The inhibition of cholesterol esterification en-
sures that all of the intracellular cholesterol is free and
thus the specific activity is uniform among the pools. Pre-
liminary experiments omitting the ACAT inhibitor were
performed, but interpretation of the data is difficult be-
cause of the complexity of the system. Changes in the assay
protocol would have to be made to ensure similar cho-
lesterol specific activity in both the free and esterified
cholesterol pools. In addition, the rate-determining step
could be FC efflux from the plasma membrane or CE
hydrolysis, depending on the experimental conditions.
With the protocol using ACAT inhibition, accurate mea-
surement of cholesterol influx, efflux, and I/E can be
readily obtained from a relatively large number of samples.
Bidirectional flux with HDL
The bidirectional flux assay was developed and validated
using Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells, which have been used in
cholesterol efflux experiments in a large number of studies
(26–31). Fu5AH cells have high levels of SR-BI protein
(32); thus, one of the major mechanisms for cholesterol
flux is mediated by this receptor. In addition, Fu5AH cells
express a mutated LDL receptor that is efficient in inter-
nalizing apoB-containing lipoproteins (33). Thus, influx of
cholesterol would occur by FC exchange, lipoprotein inter-
nalization, and SR-BI-mediated selective uptake. In our
study, we used purified HDL3 and apoB-depleted human
serum prepared by PEG precipitation. Both preparations
gave essentially similar results. Incubation of Fu5AH cells
containing basal levels of cholesterol with HDL resulted in
similar movements of cholesterol influx and efflux, yield-
ing I/E close to 1, consistent with cholesterol exchange
(Tables 1, 2, Figs. 1, 2C). However, if the cells were en-
riched with cholesterol, the I/E shifted from z1.0 to 0.5,
indicating that net efflux occurred, as seen in Fig. 1. The
shift to net efflux occurred because influx from the HDL
was unaffected by cell cholesterol enrichment, whereas the
mass of cholesterol released was increased. This result was
consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated that
increases of cell cholesterol did not change the fractional
release of cholesterol but increased the size of the cell pool
of cholesterol from which efflux occurred (19).
Using the SR-BI inhibitor BLT-1 (20, 34), we were able
to determine the contribution of that receptor to the up-
take and release of cholesterol from Fu5AH cells incu-
bated with either HDL3 or apoB-depleted serum (Fig. 4).
Under the conditions of our assay, we observed thatz60%
of the total efflux was inhibited by BLT-1 treatment,
indicating that this was the contribution of SR-BI to total
efflux. The mechanism for efflux of the remaining 40%
has yet to be established. However, we have observed,
using both fibroblasts and macrophages, that from 40% to
60% of the total efflux to HDL or serum is not mediated by
either SR-BI or ABCA1 (M. Duong et al., unpublished
data). Surprisingly, SR-BI contributed z90% of the influx
of HDL cholesterol.
Bidirectional flux with LDL
As with the HDL, we generated bidirectional flux values
using both isolated human LDL and the apoB component
of serum. The latter values were calculated as the dif-
ference in flux between whole serum and apoB-depleted
serum. In both cases, there was large net influx (Tables 1, 2
Figs. 1, 2E). With Fu5AH cells, the I/E showed a linear
increase with increasing concentrations of the apoB com-
ponent of the serum, primarily because efflux was low and
independent of concentration, whereas influx increased
over the concentration range. The SR-BI contribution to
both influx and efflux with LDL was again determined on
the basis of the inhibition with BLT-1. SR-BI was re-
sponsible forz60% of the total efflux from Fu5AH cells to
LDL (Fig. 4A). SR-BI contributedmuch less to the influx of
LDL (20%; Fig. 4B). Because Fu5AH cells express LDL
receptors, the LDL internalization route of cholesterol
incorporation probably has the greatest effect on choles-
terol influx.
Bidirectional flux with human serum
With 2.5% human serum, there was net cholesterol in-
flux, as indicated by an I/E . 1. Net cholesterol incor-
poration into cholesterol-normal hepatoma cells occurred
at all serum concentrations used (2.5–12.5%; Fig. 2A). The
direction of the flux was also not affected by using dif-
ferent incubation periods of cells with the serum, as shown
in Fig. 3. The I/E increased linearly with the concentra-
tion of serum, reaching ratios as high as 3.5 at increased
serum concentrations (Fig. 2B). This ratio, in the case of
serum, was lower compared with the ratio obtained with
the isolated apoB-containing lipoprotein fraction, reflect-
ing the efflux contribution of the HDL present in the
serum (compare Fig. 2B with 2F). Enriching the cells in
cholesterol shifted the ratio from values reflecting net
influx to values close to exchange (Fig. 1).
Bidirectional flux with mouse peritoneal macrophages
After using the Fu5AH hepatoma cells as a vehicle for
developing and validating the bidirectional flux protocol,
we then extended the studies to examine the flux of
cholesterol between extracellular particles and elicited
MPMs. Bidirectional flux was measured using cholesterol-
normal cells and macrophages enriched with cholesterol
by exposure to acLDL (Fig. 5). Human serum produced a
small net efflux from cholesterol-normal cells, and this net
efflux was greatly enhanced upon cell cholesterol enrich-
ment. The impact of cell cholesterol enrichment was even
more dramatic when the extracellular particle was LDL, in
which case the I/E shifted from one describing net influx
with cholesterol-normal cells to net efflux with cholesterol-
loaded macrophages (Fig. 5). As with the hepatoma cells,
the effect of FC loading was primarily to increase the
movement of cholesterol out of cells, with a much more
modest effect on movement into the cells. The shift in the
I/E from net influx to net efflux, particularly with LDL,
demonstrated how the cholesterol status of the cells can
markedly influence net flux and may, at least in part,

explain the observation by Van Eck et al. (35) that SR-BI
can play a dual role by promoting the deposition of
cholesterol in early lesions, when macrophages would not
yet contain large amounts of cholesterol, but can be
atheroprotective at later stages of plaque formation, when
macrophages would be cholesterol-loaded and net efflux
could be elicited. When acLDL was the extracellular
particle, there was a large increase in influx compared with
control human LDL, resulting in increased net influx.
This was particularly evident with the combination of
cholesterol-normal macrophages exposed to acLDL and
is consistent with the ability of modified LDL to enrich
macrophages with excess cholesterol. Interestingly, in
contrast to the other extracellular particles, in which cho-
lesterol influx did not change after loading, cholesterol
influx from HDL3 was almost totally abolished in cho-
lesterol-loaded cells. A recent publication by Yu et al. (36),
as well as results from our research group, indicated that
SR-BI levels decreased upon cholesterol loading of macro-
phages with acLDL. To enrich cells in our experiments, we
used the same concentration of acLDL shown able to re-
duce SR-BI expression (36). As a consequence, no choles-
terol influx from HDL3 occurred. As observed in Fu5AH
studies with BLT-1, this is consistent with cholesterol
influx from HDL being largely mediated by SR-BI.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that an assay is
available that can simultaneously and accurately quantitate
the bidirectional flux of cholesterol between cells and
either serum or isolated lipoproteins. The assay can be
applied to a variety of different cells, and by using inhib-
itors of cholesterol flux such as the SR-BI inhibitor BLT-1,
it can provide a measurement of the role of different flux
pathways in both cholesterol influx and efflux. In the
future, this assay can be used as a tool to quantitate the
ability of any sera to mediate the net flux of cholesterol
mass or to test molecules that can modulate the first step
of reverse cholesterol transport.
