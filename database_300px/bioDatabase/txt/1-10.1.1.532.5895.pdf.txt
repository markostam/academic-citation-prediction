ABSTRACT
G .U wobble base pairs are the most common and
highly conserved non-Watson–Crick base pairs in
RNA. Previous surface maps imply uniformly nega-
tive electrostatic potential at the major groove of
G .U wobble base pairs embedded in RNA helices,
suitable for entrapment of cationic ligands. In this
work, we have used a Poisson–Boltzmann approach
to gain a more detailed and accurate characteriza-
tion of the electrostatic profile. We found that the
major groove edge of an isolated G .U wobble
displays distinctly enhanced negativity compared
with standard GC or AU base pairs; however, in the
context of different helical motifs, the electrostatic
pattern varies. G .U wobbles with distinct widening
have similar major groove electrostatic potentials to
their canonical counterparts, whereas those with
minimal widening exhibit significantly enhanced
electronegativity, ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 kT/e,
depending upon structural features. We propose
that the negativity at the major groove of G .U
wobble base pairs is determined by the combined
effect of the base atoms and the sugar-phosphate
backbone, which is impacted by stacking pattern
and groove width as a result of base sequence.
These findings are significant in that they provide
predictive power with respect to which G .U sites in
RNA are most likely to bind cationic ligands.
INTRODUCTION
It is now widely accepted that RNA molecules participate
actively in virtually all cellular metabolic processes. Unlike
DNA, in which double stranded complementary Watson–
Crick (WC) base pairs are obligatory to maintain genetic
ﬁdelity, RNA molecules are rich in structural elements
comprising non-canonical (i.e. mismatched) base pairs,
base triples, junctions, turns, bulges and loops [recently
reviewed by Leontis and Westhof (1)]. These structural
elements are essential for RNA biological function.
Therefore, knowledge of the physicochemical properties
of these structural elements will help us understand the
molecular basis of RNA folding, stability and function.
One such structural element is the GU wobble base pair
(from here on referred to as a GU pair), which is the most
common non-WC base pair present in RNA.
First hypothesized by Crick in 1966 to account for
codon degeneracy (2), the GU pair has been found in
nearly all forms of RNA including transfer (t)RNAs (3,4),
small nuclear (sn)RNAs (5) and ribosomal (r)RNAs (6,7).
Several ribozymes also contain GU pairs in their
structures, such as the Group I and Group II introns
(8–10) and the Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) ribozyme
(11). Furthermore, most of the GU pairs are highly
conserved. Substitution of a GU pair with other base
pairs often has detrimental eﬀects on RNA function. For
example, the single G3U70 pair at the acceptor arm of
the Escherichia coli tRNAAla is the identity element for
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase recognition. Substitution of
this GU pair with WC base pairs completely abolishes
aminoacylation with alanine both in vitro and in vivo
(12,13). The G1U37 wobble pair at the P1 helix of HDV
ribozyme is critical for its cleavage reaction. Only an AC
wobble pair, but not WC base pairs, could partially
replace the GU in terms of reactivity (11,14). A GU pair
located in stem I of the mRNA coding for ribosomal
protein S15 is an example of the UG/CG motif, which
serves as the recognition determinant for the binding and
autoregulation of S15 (15).
Studies have identiﬁed several properties that contribute
to the diverse biological function of GU pairs. First, the
geometry of the GU pair provides unique chemical
groups in the major and minor grooves. Among them,
the non-hydrogen-bonded amino group of guanine in the
minor groove was thought to be important for the 50 splice
site selection of the Group I intron (10,16). Second, the
continuous presence of three electronegative groups
(guanine N7, guanine O6 and uracil O4) creates a broad

region of negative electrostatic potential in the major
groove of the GU pair. This region of electronegative
potential is proposed as the recognition site for the
binding of metal ions and other positively charged ligands
(17–21). In fact, a recently compiled database of metal ion
binding sites in RNA structures has shown that the major
groove of the GU pair is the most common metal ion
binding motif (22). Third, it has been noted that the
presence of the GU pairs in the A-form RNA helices
introduces certain sequence-dependent changes to the
structural parameters like the helical twist (23–26). It was
proposed that the distortion of the backbone by the GU
pair positions the functional groups of the HDV ribozyme
for eﬃcient catalysis (27). Detailed reviews on the
structural, chemical and biological properties of RNA
structure with GU pairs can be found elsewhere (19,28).
GU pairs occur in nearly every class of RNA as single
base pair or in tandem form (i.e. adjacent GU pairs).
Most of the GU pairs found in tRNA are in single form,
whereas tandem GU pairs are commonly observed in
rRNA. Analysis of the tandem GU pairs in rRNAs
showed that the sequence 50-UG-30/30-GU-50 (Motif I) is
the most prevalent, followed by 50-UU-30/30-GG-50 (Motif
III) and 50-GU-30/30-UG-50 (Motif II). Thermodynamic
stabilities of RNA structures containing these three motifs
follow the same order (29–31).
NMR and X-ray studies have explored the structural
features of diﬀerent motifs for tandem GU pairs
(17,32–34). In Motif I, the six-member ring of the guanine
base of the GU pair stacks directly on top of the six-
member ring of the guanine of the opposite strand.
In contrast, there is considerable intra-strand stacking
between the tandem GU pairs in Motif II, with the purine
ring overlying the pyrimidine ring. Motif III exhibits an
intermediate situation between Motif I and Motif II, with
a mix of inter- and intra-strand stacking. Data from
structural studies suggest that electrostatic interaction,
base stacking, hydrogen bonding and the neighboring
WC base pairs all contribute to the thermodynamic
stabilities of diﬀerent tandem GU motifs (17,32–34).
As a result of the strong electrostatic ﬁeld associated
with the high-charge density of the RNA sugar-phosphate
backbone, RNA structure and function are highly
inﬂuenced by electrostatic interactions. The molecular
surfaces of RNA molecules display unique electrostatic
patterns that are important for recognition and binding of
cationic species [for example, see references (18,35)].
Therefore, careful quantitative characterization of electro-
static features of RNA structural elements, such as the
GU pair, is vital for a better understanding of RNA
ligand recognition events. Previous studies of the electro-
static features of the GU pair were focused on the general
properties of the major groove of a limited number
of structures.
In this research, we seek to provide a more in depth,
quantitative analysis of the electrostatic properties of
individual GU pair motifs in order to achieve a
detailed understanding of eﬀects contributing to the
total electrostatic landscape. The ultimate goal is to
predict accurately the likelihood of entrapment of cationic
ligands. To accomplish this, we employ the non-linear
Poisson–Boltzmann approach, which delivers precise sur-
face and site electrostatic potential values. Our calcula-
tions indicated that, in some cases, the major groove of
GU pairs demonstrated enhanced electronegativity over
standard GC and AU base pairs. For single GU pairs,
it is sequence dependent, but for tandem GU pairs, it
largely depends on motif conformation. Furthermore, we
propose that both the sugar-phosphate backbone and the
GU base atoms contribute signiﬁcantly to the electro-
negativity at the major groove of the GU pairs.
METHODS
Structures
The structures used in the calculations were selected from
the Protein Data Bank [PDB (36)] with the help of a
database of non-canonical base pairs found in known
RNA structures (37). The PDB codes of both NMR and
X-ray structures used in this paper are listed in Table 1.
The structures contain either single GU pair or tandem
GU pairs in diﬀerent motifs. For NMR structures with
multiple models, calculations were done on two models
with the lowest potential energies as assessed using
AMBER8 (38). In all the cases, as the two models
showed very similar trends, only the results from the
model with the lowest potential energy were presented. All
physical coordinates of helical structures used in this study
were incorporated into our calculations exactly as
experimentally determined (except 1IKD, as noted in
Table 1). For each helix containing GU pair(s), we
generated a set of new helices in which both WC GC and
AU base pairs replaced the GU pair(s). These model ideal
A-RNA helices (39) were generated using the AMBER8
(38) nucgen utility and were for the purpose of compar-
ison with their GU counterparts. In one case included in
our study, the original structure determination included
both GU (PDB: 434D) and GC (PDB: 435D) helices. The
missing hydrogen atoms were added with the program
REDUCE (40).
Solution to the non-linear poisson Boltzmann equation (PBE)
The electrostatic potentials at the surface (here taken as
the solvent-excluded molecular surface deﬁned by a probe
radius of 1.4 A˚) and atomic sites of isolated GU, GC and
AU base pairs were obtained with the fast multipole-
accelerated (41) boundary element solution of the Poisson
equation (42). The interior and exterior dielectric con-
stants were ﬁxed at 2 and 80 (258C), respectively. All
default code parameters were employed as described in
detail elsewhere (42). For RNA helices, which are now
embedded in a solvent medium that contains univalent salt
ions corresponding to a salt concentration of 1M (with an
ion exclusion region of 2 A˚ radius), a novel linear/non-
linear Poisson–Boltzmann algorithm was used (Boschitsch
and Fenley, unpublished results). Very similar results were
also obtained using the hybrid boundary element and
ﬁnite diﬀerence Poisson–Boltzmann solver (with no ion
exclusion region) which was employed previously (43).
The atomic partial charges and radii were taken from the
AMBER94 force ﬁeld (44). Calculations repeated with the

CHARMM27 force ﬁeld parameters (45) showed the same
trend. This similarity indicates that our conclusions were
independent of the choice of radii and charge parameters.
Formal RNA charges, with a 0.5e charge assigned to
each non-bridging phosphate oxygen atom, were
employed to examine sequence independent electrostatic
features. When formal RNA charges were used, the
atomic radii were assigned based on the AMBER94
parameter set.
Visualization
The molecular surfaces were color coded according to
electrostatic potential derived from either the Poisson or
the non-linear PBE and were rendered using the virtual
reality modeling language (VRML) (46). The 3D struc-
tures of the RNA base pairs and helices were displayed
using the ViewerPro program (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) and saved in the VRML ﬁle format. The 3D
structure was then incorporated into the electrostatic
potential maps for easy identiﬁcation. In order to facilitate
visual inspection, color mapping of the electrostatic
potential was ﬁnely scaled as follows: green (most
positive), followed by blue, white (neutral), red and
yellow (most negative).
Calculations of site and groove electrostatic potentials
The electrostatic potentials surrounding speciﬁc atom
sites were calculated by taking the average electrostatic
potential of sampled grid points outside the molecule
around the particular atom. The grid points were sampled
by generating two layers of spheres 1.2 and 2.4 A˚ away
from the van der Waals surface of the atom. The
electrostatic potentials of the grid points were obtained
using the Poisson and PBE approach for the isolated base
pairs and RNA helices, respectively, as described above.
The electrostatic potential of the major and the minor
groove was calculated by averaging the site electrostatic
potential of the GU pair(s) base atoms facing the major/
minor groove surface. The atoms facing the major groove
include N7(G), O6(G), N4(C), NH4(C) and O4(U). The
atoms facing the minor groove include N2(G), N3(G),
NH2(G), O2(C) and O2(U).
Calculations of cross-strand phosphate distance
The cross-strand inter-phosphate distance for a given base
pair step was computed using the 3DNA program (47).
RESULTS
Electrostatic features of the isolated G .U pair
We began our study of the electrostatic features of the
GU pair by calculating the electrostatic potentials of an
isolated GU pair without the context of the RNA helix,
and comparing the results with isolated WC GC and AU
base pairs. The calculation was accomplished by use of the
Poisson equation as described in Methods. Figure 1 shows

the surface electrostatic potential maps for the isolated
GU and WC GC/AU pairs. As shown in the ﬁgure, the
major groove of the AU base pair is mostly negative along
the edge formed by the nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen
atoms, with a positive electrostatic potential spot asso-
ciated with the adenine amino group.
Greater extremes in electrostatic polarity are observed
in the major groove of the GC base pair. Deep
electronegative potential is seen on the G edge, while the
C edge is predominantly electropositive. The polarity
observed in the WC base pair is due to the presence of
electropositive amino group of adenine and cytosine in the
major groove. In contrast, the major groove of the GU
pair is uniformly and strongly negative, since the
co-planar N7(G), O6(G) and O4(U) atoms lining the
major groove are all electronegative. On the minor groove
edge, the non-hydrogen-bonded guanine NH2 group of
the GU pair created an electropositive region, which is
absent in the AU pair and less pronounced in the GC pair.
We calculated an average electrostatic potential at the
major groove of the isolated GU pair of 0.4 kT/e, as
compared with average electrostatic potentials at the
major grooves of GC and AU base pairs of 0.2 and
0.3 kT/e, respectively. The average electrostatic potential
at the minor groove of the isolated GU pair is neutral,
whereas for both GC and AU pairs, the value is
0.3 kT/e. Therefore, the overall electrostatic potential
of isolated GU pair is somewhat more negative in the
major groove and slightly more positive in the minor
groove than for the WC GC/AU base pairs.
In addition to wobble pairs, several X-ray and NMR
structures have displayed bifurcated GU interactions
(23,32,48,49). In this arrangement, the O4 of U hydrogen-
bonds with hydrogens attached to N1 or N2 of G. The
bifurcated GU positions H5 and H6 of U in the major
groove, instead of the electronegative O4. Hence, the
surface electrostatic potential of bifurcated GU displays
similar polarity as observed in the WC GC base pair
(data not shown).
Use of NLPB Equation for analysis of electrostatic
features of RNA helices
Rigorous analysis of RNA electrostatic properties by PBE
can identify intense negative electrostatic potential on the
RNA molecular surface. Because RNA molecules are
highly charged, and often have irregular shapes, the non-
linear form of the PBE is the most appropriate method to
provide a precise representation of the RNA electrostatic
potentials.
We illustrate this point by calculating the electrostatic
surface potential of two helices of the Group I intron that
contain tandem GU pairs [PDB: 1C0O (50) and 1AJF
(51)] using both the non-linear PBE and the linear PBE.
Figure 2A shows the results for the NLPB treatment for
each helix, as well as the cobalt(III)-hexammine
([Co(NH3)6]
3þ) ion bound to the RNA in the NMR-
derived structure (50,51). Figure 2B shows the corre-
sponding surface maps computed with the linear PBE.
Comparison between Figure 2A and B illustrates that the
non-linear PBE, as opposed to its linearized version,
predicts the metal ion binding sites with far greater
precision.
Electrostatic features of the G .U pairs in a RNA helix
In order to examine the impact of base sequence on
electrostatic properties of GU pairs, we divided the RNA
helices containing GU pairs into four categories: (i) RNA
helices with a single internal GU pair; (ii) RNA helices
with Motif I tandem GU pairs (50-UG-30 vs. 50-UG-30,
characterized by purine-purine cross-strand stacking); (iii)
RNA helices with Motif II tandem GU pairs (50-GU-30
vs. 50-GU-30, with purine-pyrmidine intra-strand stack-
ing); and (iv) RNA helices with Motif III tandem GU
pairs (50-GG-30 vs. 50-UU-30, with a mix of intra- and
inter-strand stacking). We chose three representative
RNA helices for each of the four categories and, for the
purpose of reference, generated corresponding canonical
A-form RNA helices. These helices contained the identical
sequence, except for substitution of GU with both AU

performed using the Poisson equation as described in the Methods.

and GC (in diﬀerent structures), each having parameters
deﬁned by ﬁber diﬀraction data (39). Table 2 lists the
electrostatic potential values calculated for the GU pairs
embedded within RNA helices, compared with those of
their canonical counterparts. The data in Table 2 indicate
that the major groove electrostatic potential of each
standard A-form RNA helix is approximately
4.0 0.3 kT/e. This value ﬂuctuates only slightly with
diﬀerent base sequences and stacking patterns. In con-
trast, the major groove electrostatic potentials of the GU
pairs embedded in RNA helices vary from 4.0 to
6.3 kT/e. For RNA helices containing a single GU
pair, the major groove electrostatic potential is generally
considerably more negative than that of the corresponding
canonical RNA helices, depending on the speciﬁc base
sequence.
For RNA helices with tandem GU pairs, the major
groove electrostatic potentials are highly inﬂuenced by the
stacking patterns. Figure 3 shows the surface electrostatic
potential maps for one representative RNA helix from
each motif compared with its canonical (GC) counterpart.
We found that the electrostatic features of Motif I tandem
GU pairs are quite diﬀerent from those of Motifs II and
III (also see Table 2). The electrostatic potential at the
major groove of Motif I RNA helices is more positive than
(one case) or slightly more negative than (two cases) that
of the corresponding WC RNA helix, depending upon
groove width (see ahead). However, all of the Motif II and
Motif III RNA helices showed enhanced negativity at
the major groove, compared with their WC counterparts
(GC or AU). We also noted that helices with Motif I are
less negative than that of Motif II and Motif III. The most
dramatic example was observed between 1EKA and
1GUC. Despite similarities in helical length and the
nearest neighbor base pairs, the major groove electrostatic
potential of 1GUC is signiﬁcantly more negative than that
of 1EKA (6.3 kT/e vs. 3.5 kT/e).
Electrostatic potentials at the atomic sites of the G .U pairs

negative in the sense that there is no positive amino group

present, a close look at individual base atom sites revealed
that electrostatic polarity still exists at the major groove.
Figure 4 presented the electrostatic potential at N7(G),
O6(G) and O4(U) of the GU pairs from each RNA helix
studied (for RNA helices with tandem GU pairs, only one
GU pair was shown). For each GU pair, the average
electrostatic potential associated with O6(G) are the most
electronegative. In most cases, O4(U) is the least electro-
negative atom. On average, the diﬀerence in potential
between O6(G) and O4(U) is 1.7 kT/e. In 434D, the
extreme case, the diﬀerence between O6(G) and O4(U) is
as high as 2.6 kT/e.
The sources of negativity at the G .Umajor groove
Next, we investigated the sources of the broad region of
negative electrostatic potential at the major groove of the
RNA helix containing the GU pair(s). The two most
likely sources are the partial charges of the GU base
atoms and the sugar-phosphate backbone charges. To
investigate the contributions from the partial charges of
the GU base atoms to the major groove potential, we
obtained two major groove electrostatic potential values.
The ﬁrst was calculated with all partial charges included
and the other with the partial charges of the GU base
atoms set to zero. The contribution from the GU base
atoms was then deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the two
electrostatic potential values. As a control, we also
calculated the contribution of the corresponding GC/AU
base atoms to the major groove potential. Figure 5
illustrates the contributions of the partial charges of the
GU, GC and AU base atoms to the major groove
potentials. As is shown, the partial charges of the GU
base atoms make a signiﬁcant contribution to the total
major groove electronegativity, while the base partial
charges of the WC GC/AU base pairs have only a small
eﬀect. Overall, tandem GU base atoms contribute around
2.0 kT/e to their major groove electronegativity, whereas
the corresponding WC base pairs contribute only about
0.7 kT/e to the major groove electrostatic potential.

motif, comparison between GU (left) and GC (right) base pairs were
made. The potential maps were computed with the non-linear PBE,
including the partial charges of all atoms. The color scheme used here
is the same as in Figure 2.

We then examined the contributions of sugar-phosphate
backbone to the electronegativity by calculating the
‘formal’ electrostatic potential. The calculation was
performed by placing a -0.5e charge on each non-bridging
phosphate oxygen atom. Table 3 shows the major groove
electrostatic potentials of the GU pairs derived from these
calculations, compared with their canonical counterparts.
For the majority of the RNA helices containing GU
pairs, the formal major groove electrostatic potential of
GU pairs is similar to that of the standard A-form RNA
helices. However, for some GU pairs (for example, 1HLX
and 1EKA), the formal major groove electrostatic
potential is less negative than their canonical counterparts.
In particular, we found that most RNA helices with Motif
I tandem GU pairs have less negative formal electrostatic
potential than their canonical counterparts. On the other
hand, the majority of RNA helices with tandem Motif II
and III GU pairs have similar formal electrostatic
potential as their WC counterparts. The gradation of the
potential is depicted very clearly in Figure 6. Again, we
noticed that helices with Motif I are less negative than that
of Motif II and Motif III, when the electrostatic potential
were computed with only the sugar phosphate backbone
charges included (also see Table 3).
In order to investigate the origin of the diﬀerence in
formal electrostatic potential between the diﬀerent motifs,
we evaluated the inter-strand phosphate-phosphate dis-
tance. As shown in Table 3, Motif I had a wider mean
cross-strand interphosphate distance than either of the
other motifs or than the canonical helices. A wider major
groove will result in a lesser concentration of negative
potential from the backbone and bases. In contrast,
dimensions of the major groove in helices having Motifs II
and III are relatively similar to their WC counterparts. In
these motifs, the more negative potential is readily
apparent.
In summary, GU base pair atoms, regardless of the
motif, contribute to enhancement of the electronegativity
in the major groove. However, the diﬀerent motifs have
diﬀerent groove width, thus diﬀerent formal electrostatic
potential.
The electrostatic features at the G .Uminor groove
We focused our study of the electrostatic features of
the GU pair on the major groove, which is the primary
binding site for catonic groups in RNA helices.
Unlike the major groove, the minor groove potential of
standard A-form RNA exhibits a higher degree of
dependence on base sequences (Table 2), with the partial
charges of the base atoms contributing heavily to the
groove potential. In contrast, the GU base atoms do not
make signiﬁcant contributions to the minor groove
potential (data not shown). Although the minor groove
electrostatic potential of an isolated GU pair is more
positive than that of isolated WC base pairs,
when incorporated into RNA helices, the minor groove
electrostatic potential of GU pairs tends to be more
negative than that of the WC base pairs in standard RNA
helices (see Table 2). Our results therefore disagree with
those of Trikha et al. (52), who performed electrostatic

potential analyses of an RNA helix with a Motif III
tandem GU pair and reached the conclusion that the
minor groove presented a region of positive potential,
which was absent in its canonical counterpart. We were
not able to identify the source of discrepancy between our
results. However, we noticed that the electrostatic patterns
of the WC RNA helix used as the control in their study
contradicts standardly accepted electrostatic proﬁle of
A-RNA (i.e. the major groove should be more negative
than the minor groove).
DISCUSSION
Divalent metal ions are critical for RNA structure and
function (53–57). Metal ions can facilitate folding of RNA
into a variety of intricate tertiary structures by counter-
balancing the repulsion between the negative charges of
the sugar-phosphate backbone, and some metal ions
participate directly in ribozyme catalysis. Although there
is no deﬁnitive method for identiﬁcation of metal ion
binding sites in RNA under physiological conditions,
location of site bound ions are often inferred from results
of X-ray crystallography, NMR or phosphorothioate
substitution experiments, among other methods.
However, there is great value in being able to predict
likely cationic binding sites based upon computational
methods. Techniques such as valence screening, molecular
and Brownian dynamics simulations, and microenviron-
ment analysis have been used to identify possible metal ion
binding sites (58–62). Given the strength of the NLPB in
accurate prediction of the electrostatic features of
structured biopolyelectrolytes (59), we have applied this
technique to obtain detailed information about the
electrostatic potential of GU base pairs in diﬀerent
structural contexts.
The negative potential of the G .U pair facilitates cationic
binding
Numerous experimental studies have identiﬁed GU major
groove atoms located within hydrogen bonding distance
to metal ions (23,48–51,59,63–66), protein cationic side
chains (49,67–70), and aminoglycosidic antibiotics (58,71).
It has been suggested that the pronounced negative
electrostatic potential at the GU major groove is an
important factor in attracting positively charged ligands
(17–19,23). We conﬁrmed that most GU pairs display
enhanced electronegativity at the major groove, ranging
from 0.8 to 2.5 kT/e, while some GU pairs have
similar major groove electrostatic potentials to their
canonical counterparts.
To show how the enhanced electronegativity facilitates
cationic binding, we computed the electrostatic contribu-
tion to binding free energy (Gelecbinding) of [Co(NH3)6]
3þ to
P5b helix (PDB:1AJF) and P5 helix (PDB:1C0O) of
Group I intron using both all-atom and formal charge sets
(method to be published elsewhere). We found that in
1AJF, the major groove becomes more negative
when switching from formal charge sets to total
charge sets (3.4 kT/e vs. 5.3 kT/e). Concurrently,
Gelecbindingbecomes more favorable (42.8 kcal/mol vs.
6.3 kcal/mol). A similar eﬀect was observed in 1C0O.
So the increase in electronegativity will greatly enhance
the binding aﬃnity of positively charged ligands.
We emphasize that Gelecbinding only measures the electro-
static contributions to binding aﬃnity. Other factors such
as hydrophobic, van der Waals and entropic contributions
should also be taken into account when estimating binding
aﬃnities.

including the partial charges of only sugar-phosphate atoms. The color
scheme used here is the same as in Figure 2.

Where do metal ions bind in the major groove of G .U pairs?
Although the major groove of the GU pairs is negative
overall, the surface is still polarized, with the G side more
negative than the U side. This is true for both single and
tandem GU pairs. In Motif III, since the two guanines are
on the same strand, one side of the helix is more negative
than the other side. On the other hand, as the two
guanines in Motif II belong to diﬀerent strands, the center
of the GU pairs is the most negative part of the helix. This
prediction agrees with the experimental ﬁnding that the
cobalt hexammine bound to the Motif II tandem GU
pairs in P5b helix of Group I intron is located at the center
of the helix, while the cobalt hexamine bound to the Motif
III tandem GU pairs in P5 helix resides at the guanine
side of the helix (50,51) (see Figure 2A). Doudna et al. also
showed that a cobalt hexammine ion binds to the guanine
side of a tandem GU pair in the signal recognition
particle (72). In fact, many instances have been noted
in which sequential guanines in both DNA and RNA
are favorable binding sites for cationic ligands
(23,51,62,73,74), suggesting that this pattern provides an
important biological recognition site.
Why are some G .U pairs in RNA helices more negative
than theirWC counterparts?
When embedded in a RNA helix, certain single GU pairs
and most Motif I tandem GU pairs have similar major
groove electronegativity to their canonical counterparts
(Table 2). However, some single GU pairs, and most
Motif II and Motif III tandem GU pairs showed
enhanced negativity at the major groove, compared with
their WC counterparts. Therefore, the natural question is
what contributes to the enhanced negativity for certain
GU pairs? Our results show that backbone charges are
the dominant source of major groove negativity for
standard A-form RNA helices (Table 3, Figure 5),
whereas the base atoms only contribute a small fraction.
Since standard A-form RNA helices have nearly identical
cross-strand phosphate distances, their major groove
electrostatic potentials have little variation.
On the other hand, for RNA helices containing GU
pairs, both GU base atoms and the sugar-phosphate
backbone are important in determining the major groove
potential. For all GU pairs, regardless of base sequence
or conformation, GU base atoms contribute more to
the major groove negativity than the WC base atoms
(Figure 5). When embedded in RNA helices, the cross-
strand phosphate distance of certain GU pairs (1EKA,
1QET and 315D) becomes larger. Correspondingly, the
formal electrostatic potentials of these Motif I GU pairs
are less negative than their canonical counterparts
(Table 3). The decreased formal electrostatic potentials
cancel the enhanced negativity produced by the GU base
atoms. As a result, the total major groove electrostatic
potentials of these GU pairs are similar to their canonical
counterparts.
In contrast, the cross-strand phosphate distances of
certain single GU pairs, and most Motif II and Motif III
tandem GU pairs are similar to standard A-form RNA
helices, so their formal electrostatic potentials are also
similar. Consequently, the net electrostatic negativity is
elevated by the enhanced negativity contributed by the
GU base atoms.
We note that other factors such as the neighboring
clusters of non-canonical base pairs will change the cross-
strand phosphate distances and thus, aﬀect the absolute
values of the major groove electrostatic potential. For
example, loop E of 5S rRNA contains tandem GU pairs
in Motif I conformation (PDB: 1DFU). Because there are
other non-WC base pairs adjacent to the tandem GU
pairs, the cross-strand phosphate distance is similar to
standard A-RNA and smaller than other Motif I GU
pairs studied in this paper. As a result of the speciﬁc
geometry, the formal major groove electrostatic potential
of 1DFU is quite negative (4.2 kT/e vs. 2.4 kT/e), in
stark contrast with the other Motif I GU pairs studied
here. The total major groove electrostatic potential for this
particular tandem GU pairs is 6.5 kT/e, far more
negative than the other Motif I GU pairs. Another
example in which geometry alters the general pattern is an
RNA duplex with non-symmetrical tandem GU pairs
(PDB: 433D). Although the tandem GU pairs are in
Motif III conformation, the cross-strand phosphate
distance is larger than standard A-RNA due to the
proximity of two tandem GU pairs. Thus the formal
major groove electronegativity is decreased, and the total
major groove electrostatic potential is comparable to the
WC counterparts. Therefore, we ﬁnd that geometry of
ﬂanking structures exert substantial impact on the overall
electrostatic proﬁle and ultimate recognition as a cationic
binding site.
AreMotif I G .U pairs effective binding sites for metal ions?
Our results show that the electrostatic potentials at the
major groove of GU pairs in the Motif I conformation
are similar to those of the standard A-form RNA. Also,
the major groove electrostatic potentials of Motif I tend to
be less negative than those of Motif II and Motif III.
Although Motif I is the most abundant tandem format in
nature, we did not identify many structures of Motif I with
experimentally resolved bound metal ions. We therefore
can ask if Motif I GU pairs are eﬀective binding sites for
metal ions. The answer is still likely to be yes. First, it has
been proposed that the absence of positively charged
groups makes the major groove of the GU pair an
attractive target for metal ions, not the absolute value of
the electrostatic potential (18). Second, we have shown
that the reason that most Motif I GU pairs have similar
major groove electrostatic potential to WC base pairs
is the larger cross-strand phosphate distance. Those
Motif I GU pairs with smaller cross-strand phosphate
distance (e.g. loop E of 5S rRNA) also have enhanced
negative major groove. Third, the factors that contribute
to binding aﬃnity are a composite of electrostatics
and geometry, as well as hydration and quantum eﬀects.
The speciﬁcs of interactions with complex ion
([Co(NH3)6]
3þ) are often very diﬀerent from those with
hydrated Mg2þ (73,75). For example, binding aﬃnity
studies by Colmenarejo and Tinoco (50) found that the
relative binding aﬃnity of tandem GU pairs for cobalt

hexammine is: Motif IIMotif III4Motif I; for Mg2þ,
the order is changed to Motif I4Motif II4Motif III. The
most likely explanation for the variation in binding
aﬃnities is that Mg2þ binds to Motif I as a partially
dehydrated ion, whereas it is not the case for Motif II and
Motif III. There may also be surface features favoring one
ion over the others. By use of Brownian dynamics, Serra
et al. found that all three motifs were likely to bind
Mg(II), although the authors have not reported relative
binding aﬃnities among the diﬀerent motifs (76).
Additionally, a study by Fan et al. concluded that Motif
III binds Kþ and not Mg2þ (77). The non-linear PBE
method employed in the present work does not account
for ion size/geometry, hydration, ion correlation and
quantum mechanical eﬀects.
In conclusion, quantiﬁcation of localized electrostatic
potentials and high-resolution electrostatic surface maps
at the grooves of GU wobble base pairs have provided
signiﬁcant new information about the role of individual
chemical groups on the composite proﬁle. What has
emerged is that the diﬀerent stacking patterns associated
with various GU tandem motifs impact directly on
electronegativity, contributed by both base atoms and
sugar-phosphate backbone. Taken together with ener-
getics studies, these ﬁndings will help in the explanation
and prediction of in situ cationic binding.
