ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 20–24 nt
noncoding RNAs that regulate target mRNAs post-
transcriptionally by binding with imperfect com-
plementarity in the 30-untranslated region (30-UTR)
and inhibiting translation or RNA stability. Current
understanding of miRNA biology is limited, and
antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibition is a
powerful technique for miRNA functionalization
in vitro and in vivo, and for therapeutic targeting of
miRNAs. Identification of optimal ASO chemistries
for targeting miRNAs is therefore of great interest.
We evaluated a number of 20-sugar and backbone
ASO modifications for their ability to inhibit miR-21
activity on a luciferase reporter mRNA. ASO modifi-
cations that improved target affinity improved
miRNA ASO activity, yet the positioning of high-
affinity modifications also had dramatically different
effects on miRNA activity, suggesting that more than
affinity determined the effectiveness of the miRNA
ASOs. We present data in which the activity of a
modified miRNA ASO was inversely correlated to its
tolerability as an siRNA passenger strand, suggest-
ing that a similar mechanism could be involved in the
dissociation of miRNA ASOs and siRNA passenger
strands. These studies begin to define the factors
important for designing improved miRNA ASOs,
enabling more effective miRNA functionalization
and therapeutic targeting.
INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenously expressed
small regulatory noncoding RNAs thought to negatively regu-
late target mRNAs by binding with imperfect complementar-
ity in their 30-untranslated regions (30-UTRs) (1–4). Based on
early studies in invertebrates, miRNAs are expected to have
roles in developmental regulation and cell differentiation in
mammals, and roles for miRNAs in cardiogenesis (5) and
lymphocyte development (6) have been demonstrated. Several
studies suggest a strong connection between miRNA and
human cancer (7–12). Recent reports implicate roles for mam-
malian miRNAs in metabolic pathways (13–16). MiRNAs
have also been shown to suppress (17) and enhance (18) levels
of viral RNA in cells. Despite this growing list of roles for
mammalian miRNAs, most of the hundreds of miRNAs
identified in mammals (19,20) have no reported function.
Conventional single strand antisense oligonucleotides
(ASOs) (13,21–25) or double strand siRNAs (26–30) targeting
coding genes have been successfully used to screen for gene
function in high-throughput cellular assays. ASOs have also
been widely used to evaluate gene function and validate gene
targets in vivo (31–37) and several antisense therapeutics are
in clinical trials (35,38–43). For many cellular applications
and all in vivo studies, chemically modified oligonucleo-
tides were used. Properties of modified oligonucleotides
associated with improved activity include improved hybrid-
ization affinity for the target nucleic acid, resistance to
endogenous nucleases, or improved activation of RNase H
or other proteins involved in the terminating mechanism.
In addition, alteration of protein binding properties with
the aim of improving ASO delivery or altering toxicological
profiles can be beneficial (44–56). Recently, anti-miRNA
ASOs have been used to examine functions of miRNAs
in flies (57–59), mammalian cells (13,14,60–63) and mice
(15,16). Therapeutic potential for anti-miRNA ASOs has even
been suggested (14–16,18,64). In contrast to the extensive
optimization of oligonucleotide chemistry for ASOs targeting
mRNA or pre-mRNA, little has been done to optimize the
chemistry for ASOs targeting miRNAs. Most of the studies
mentioned above employed 20-O-methyl (20-O-Me) substituted
RNA oligonucleotides. There are also reports using DNA
(57,59) or a mixed locked nucleic acid (LNA)-DNA ASO (62)
and two studies have used 20-O-methoxyethyl (20-O-MOE)
substituted RNA oligonucleotides (13,16). We set out to evalu-
ate the effect of ASO structure and modification on anti-
miRNA activity, using a ‘luciferase sensor’ assay for miR-21
activity in Hela cells. We report below effects of 20-sugar and
backbone modification on activity of anti-miRNA ASOs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oligonucleotide synthesis
Oligonucleotides were prepared using conventional phosphor-
amidite chemistry and DNA synthesis equipment (Applied
Biosystems). The 20 modified phosphoramidites and succinate-
linked solid support were obtained from commercial sources.
The purity of all samples was >85% as monitored by ele-
ctrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. miR-21
ASO sequence: 50-TCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTA-30.
For all modified ASOs except the 20F, C was methylated at
the 5 position. The 20F ASO had unmethylated C and uracil
replaced thymine.
siRNA preparation
Oligonucleotides for preparation of siRNA duplexes were
ordered from Dharmacon or Integrated DNA Technologies.
Oligonucleotides were purified using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). Strands to be annealed were mixed
at equal concentrations in 5· annealing buffer (Dharmacon)
and incubated at 90C for 2 min. The mixture was gradually
cooled on a 37C heat block to allow duplexes to form. The
sequence of the siRNA targeting human PTEN: 50-UUUGU-
CUCUGGUCCUUACUUCC-30 (guide, unmodified RNA);
50-GGAAGTAAGGACCAGAGACAAA-30 (passenger, vari-
ous chemistries as described in Results).
Luciferase sensor assay
The miR-21 luciferase sensor construct was engineered by
inserting the full 22 bp sequence complementary to the
mature miR-21 into the 30-UTR of pGL3-Control (Promega).
Hela cells were propagated in DMEM with High Glucose
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). 3.5 · 106
Hela cells in T-170 flasks (BD Falcon) were transfected in
batch with 10 mg miR-21 luciferase sensor plasmid and 0.5 mg
of phRL-CMV plasmid (Promega) for normalization using
20 ml/flask Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 4 h of
transfection, cells were washed, trypsinized, and re-plated
at 40 000 cells/well in 24-well plates (BD Falcon). The fol-
lowing day, cells were transfected in triplicate with ASOs for
4 h using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) at 2.5 ml Lipofectin/100 nM
ASO/ml Opti-MEM I (Gibco). After ASO transfection, Hela
cells were re-fed with complete media. Cells were lysed 24 h
later, unless otherwise indicated, and luciferase activity was
measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega). Each experiment was performed at least three
times and a representative example is shown. Control ASOs
of matched chemistry but unrelated sequence were evaluated
in each experiment and, in general, did not affect luciferase
activity significantly compared to mock transfected control
cells.
Cell proliferation assay
Hela cells were plated at 4000 cells/well in 96-well plates
(BD Falcon). The following day, cells were transfected in
triplicate with ASOs for 4 h using Lipofectin (Invitrogen)
at 2.5 ml Lipofectin/100 nM ASO/ml Opti-MEM I (Gibco).
After ASO transfection, Hela cells were re-fed with DMEM
with high glucose and without phenol red (Gibco) supple-
mented with 10% FBS (Gibco). After 24 h, the cell viability
was investigated using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution
Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega).
siRNA transfection
Hela cells were plated in 96-well plates (BD Falcon) at
4000 cells/well overnight. The following day, cells were
treated with duplexes at various concentrations with 5 ml
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)/ml Opti-MEM I (Gibco)
for 4 h. After the 4 h treatment, the Hela cells were re-fed
with complete media and left overnight. The next day, cells
were lysed and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy 96
columns (Qiagen) on a BioRobot 3000 (Qiagen). Levels of
human PTEN mRNA were assayed using real-time Taqman
RT–PCR on a Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Forward

CACTGTAAAGCTGGAAAGG-30-TAMRA.
Northern blotting
RNA from treated cells was homogenized in Trizol (Invitro-
gen) and isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was separated on a 14% acrylamide TBE 8 M
urea mini-gel, then electroblotted onto Hybond N+ nylon filter
(Amersham). An end-labeled (Promega) oligonucleotide
probe for miR-21 was hybridized to the filter in Rapidhyb
buffer (Amersham). The blot was reprobed for U6 to control
for equal loading. Quantitation was done using a Storm
860 phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant
software.
Tm measurements
Absorbance versus temperature curves were measured at
260 nm using a Gilford Response II spectrophotometer. The
buffer contained 100 mM Na+, 10 mM phosphate and 0.01 mM
EDTA (pH 7.0) with sufficient Cl to achieve ionic neutrality.
Oligonucleotide concentration was 4 mM each strand deter-
mined from the absorbance at 85C and extinction coefficients
calculated according to Puglisi and Tinoco (65). Tm’s of
duplex formation were obtained from fits of data to a two
state model with linear sloping baselines (66).
RESULTS
Selection of a sensitive assay for anti-miRNA activity
MiRNAs regulate their targets post-transcriptionally, either by
inhibiting translation or causing mRNA degradation. Directly
confirmed, translationally-regulated targets are few (67–69),
and western blotting assays are cumbersome for rapid screen-
ing of anti-miRNA ASO activity. Changes in target mRNA
levels after miRNA modulation have been reported (15,16,70),
but the magnitude of the reported changes is small, often only
2- to 3-fold. We attempted to identify a miR-21 target gene
upregulated in Hela cells at the mRNA level after ASO treat-
ment. Taqman RT–PCR following ASO treatment was used to
measure levels of 26 mRNAs predicted by the TargetScan
algorithm (71) to be targets of miR-21. Two mRNAs were
identified that appeared to be upregulated after miR-21 ASO
treatment (data not shown), but each mRNA was increased
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 8 2295
no more than 2-fold, making it difficult to compare subtle
differences in activity among modified ASOs.
For comparison of modified miRNA ASOs, we needed a
convenient and sensitive system with a good dynamic range
for evaluation of miRNA activity. Incorporation of perfectly
complementary miRNA binding sites into the 30-UTR of a
reporter plasmid has been used previously to evaluate
endogenous miRNA activity (72–75). We created a miR-21
luciferase ‘sensor’ plasmid for use in these studies, as miR-21
is abundant in Hela cells. When transfected into Hela cells, the
endogenously-expressed miR-21 strongly represses the luci-
ferase sensor expression (data not shown), presumably by
binding with perfect complementarity and causing cleavage
of the mRNA. Introduction of a miR-21 ASO can prevent this
inhibition, resulting in increased luciferase expression. Using
this system, the effect of various modified ASOs targeting the
mature miR-21 sequence could be easily compared.
Effect of 20-sugar substitution on anti-miRNA activity
We first evaluated effects of several 20-sugar modifications
on miRNA ASO activity 24 h after ASO transfection. Phos-
phorothioate (PS) oligonucleotides with uniform 20-O-MOE,
20-O-Me or 20-flouro (20F) substitution were tested along with a
20-O-MOE-PS compound containing seven high affinity LNA
substitutions, one at every third position. The Tm’s for these
ASOs hybridized to a length matched complementary RNA
were measured and are shown in Table 1. As predicted
(50,56,76), all 20 substitutions increased affinity significantly
compared to DNA with 20-O-Me ﬃ 20-O-MOE < 20-F < 20-O-
MOE/LNA, and these high affinity ASOs were all more active
than the 20-deoxy-PS oligonucleotide which was inactive in
this assay (data not shown).
Anti-miRNA ASOs modified with LNA are also com-
mercially available from Exiqon. The miRCURY miRNA
knockdown probe targeting miR-21 was evaluated in the luci-
ferase sensor assay and compared to the 20-O-MOE-PS ASO
(Figure 1B). The 20-O-MOE ASO showed better activity at the
higher doses, although the compounds were similar at the
lowest dose.
We noticed that some modified ASOs, primarily 20-O-
Me-PS and 20-F-PS, had negative effects on cell growth during
the luciferase assay. In order to quantify the potential cytotoxic
effects of the ASOs, a cell proliferation assay was performed
24 h after ASO treatment (Figure 1C). After treatment with
100 nM ASO, significant inhibition in cell proliferation was
observed after treatment with the 20-O-Me-PS and the 20-F-PS
ASOs. A minor inhibition was observed after treatment with
the 20-O-MOE-PS ASO. Similar effects were observed after
treatment with control ASOs of unrelated sequence but with
the same sugar and backbone modifications (data not shown),
ruling out the possibility that the proliferation defect was
related to miR-21 inhibition. After 33 nM ASO treatment,
only minor effects on cell proliferation were observed for
the 20-O-Me and 20-F modified ASOs. At 11 nM ASO treat-
ment, no significant effects on cell proliferation were
observed.
Effect of phosphodiester backbone on anti-miRNA
activity
20-O-MOE and 20-O-Me ASOs with unmodified phosphate
(PO) backbones were also evaluated. The PS modification
is estimated to cause a 0.5–0.7C decrease in Tm for each
modification (50,76,77), so keeping the nucleosidic linkages
as a phosphodiester was expected to result in improved target
affinity. For these two ASOs, the Tm increase was only 4.4
C
for the 20-O-Me modified ASO, and 7.3C for the 20-O-MOE
ASO. This increased Tm resulted in improved activity for the
20-O-MOE-PO ASO, compared to the 20-O-MOE-PS ASO.
However, changing the backbone of the 20-O-Me ASO from
PS to PO gave no increase in activity. A 20F phosphate back-
bone ASO was not tested, as it is expected to be susceptible to
nuclease degradation within a short time (78) and a DNA-PO
ASO had no activity (data not shown).
Onset and duration of action of 20-O-MOE and
20-O-Me modified ASOs
Stability of 20-O-MOE ASOs to nucleases is significantly bet-
ter than 20-O-Me ASOs (48,49,76,79), which is one possible
reason for the discrepancy between the 20-O-MOE-PO and
20-O-Me-PO ASO activities. To evaluate the onset and dura-
tion of action of these ASOs, luciferase sensor activity was
measured at 4, 8, 24 and 48 h after transfection of 20-O-MOE
and 20-O-Me modified ASOs with either PO or PS backbones
(Figure 2). Minimal increase in luciferase activity was
observed 4 h after transfection. Eight hours after transfection,
some increase in luciferase sensor activity compared to
untreated cells was observed for all ASOs tested. The fold
change in luciferase ranged from 3- to 7-fold and differences
between the four ASOs could not be reproducibly determined.
For the 20-O-MOE substituted ASOs, the fold change in
luciferase compared to untreated cells increased from 12- to
18-fold at 24 h and increased even further at 48 h. For the
20-O-Me substituted ASOs, activity did not increase beyond
the 8 h time point.
Anti-miRNA activity of ASOs with mixed
DNA:20-O-MOE backbones
A 20-O-MOE ‘gapmer’-PS ASO, with 20-O-MOE modifica-
tions on the wings of the ASO and ten 20-deoxy nucleotides in
the center, is capable of triggering RNase H-dependent
degradation of an RNA target. However, it was not effective
at inhibiting miR-21 activity (Figure 3, Compound 9), sug-
gesting that the miRNA-ASO complex may not be accessible
to the RNase H enzyme. Apparently this gapmer ASO was also

unable to work effectively using the non-RNase H mechan-
ism(s) employed by the uniformly 20 substituted ASOs. Sub-
stitution of a 20-O-MOE residue with DNA in an ASO-RNA
duplex reduces the Tm by 1–2
C per substitution (50,76,79).
We therefore hypothesized that inactivity of the 20-O-MOE
gapmer-PS ASO was due to a decrease in target RNA binding
affinity compared to the uniform 20-O-MOE PS. To test this
hypothesis, a series of ASOs was designed by varying posi-
tioning of the 20-O-MOEs (Figure 3), and effects on Tm and
miR-21 activity were evaluated. Like the original 5-10-7 gap-
mer, each ASO had twelve 20-O-MOE and ten 20-deoxy resi-
dues. Measured Tm’s for the mixed DNA-MOE compounds
were all between that of the full DNA and the uniform 20-O-
MOE compounds (Table 1). We were surprised to discover
that compounds with the same number of 20-O-MOE and
deoxy residues could have dramatically different effects on
anti-miRNA activity (Figure 3). For some compounds, the
differences in activity correlated with the observed Tm. For
example, inverting the 20-O-MOE gapmer-PS design so that
twelve 20-O-MOE modifications were flanked by five 20-deoxy
residues on either side (Figure 3, Compound 7) resulted in a
significant increase in activity compared to the original 20-O-
MOE gapmer-PS ASO (Figure 3, Compound 9), along with a
Tm increase of 5.7
C. However, MOE-DNA-PS hemimer
motifs with 20-O-MOE residues on one end and 20-deoxy
on the other showed reproducibly different anti-miRNA activ-
ities, despite identical Tm’s. Placement of 2
0-O-MOE modi-
fications on the 30 end of the ASO (Figure 3, Compound 5)
gave poor anti-miRNA activity, while the same number of
20-O-MOE modifications on the 50 end (Figure 3, Compound

3) resulted in activity almost as good as the uniformly-
modified 20-O-MOE-PS ASO (Figure 3, Compound 2). An
ASO with an alternating MOE-DNA-PS design (Figure 3,
Compound 11) had very poor activity, and a Tm very similar
to the also inactive 20-O-MOE gapmer.
For uniformly modified 20-O-MOE ASOs, replacing the PS
backbone with PO resulted in an increase in activity (Figure 1),
so we next tested whether replacing the PS modifications with
a PO backbone in the hemimer and gapmer motifs could
improve their activity. Only the 20-O-MOE modified regions
of the ASOs were modified, as 20-deoxy-PO ASOs are highly
susceptible to nuclease degradation (47,80). Substituting PO
into the backbone improved the anti-miRNA activity of the
hemimer ASO with 20-O-MOE in the 30 part of the ASO
(Figure 3, Compounds 5 and 6), and modestly improved
activity for the gapmer with 20-O-MOE modifications placed
in the center (Figure 3, Compounds 7 and 8). However, it
did little to improve the activity of the inactive 20-O-MOE
gapmer (Figure 3, Compounds 9 and 10) or the active hemi-
mer with 20-O-MOE in the 50 part of the ASO (Figure 3,
Compounds 3 and 4).
Comparison of anti-miRNA activity to siRNA activity
These data suggested that while affinity for target RNA is
important for effective miRNA inhibition, other factors may
also contribute. An anti-miRNA ASO binding to mature
miRNA in RISC could be thought of as a passenger strand
of the miRNA or an siRNA. There is now evidence that the
double-stranded si/miRNA may associate with the Argonaute
protein in RISC before passenger strand dissociation (81–85),
and it is therefore possible that the activity responsible for
the unwinding of the passenger strand is still associated
with the complex when the anti-miRNA ASO binds. In this
case, the same interactions influencing the tolerability of
chemical modification of siRNA passenger strands may also
hold true for modified anti-miRNA ASOs. Using a model
siRNA targeting the PTEN mRNA, a set of modified sense,
or passenger strands were paired with an unmodified RNA
antisense, or guide strand, and tested for their ability to reduce
PTEN mRNA levels in Hela cells (Figure 4). The best anti-
miRNA ASO tested, the uniformly modified MOE-PO
(Figure 4, Compound 15), was completely inactive as a PTEN
siRNA passenger strand. The 20-O-Me ASO, with a PO
(Figure 4, Compound 22) or PS (Figure 4, Compound 23)
backbone, was tolerated as a PTEN siRNA passenger strand,

but with some loss of activity compared to unmodified RNA
(Figure 4, Compound 14). Surprisingly, the MOE-DNA-MOE
gapmer (Figure 4, Compound 20), and the alternating
MOE-DNA motif (Figure 4, Compound 21) were both toler-
ated as siRNA passenger strands, with no loss of activity
compared to unmodified RNA. These motifs were both inef-
fective as anti-miRNA ASOs. In general, anti-miR-21 activity
for each modified passenger strand/miRNA ASO was
inversely correlated with PTEN siRNA activity (Table 2).
Mismatch specificity and length requirements
for anti-miRNA ASOs
Finally, we examined the specificity and length requirements
of the uniformly-modified 20-O-MOE-PS ASOs. Many
miRNAs come in families that share a 6–8 nt ‘seed’ sequence
at the 50 part of the miRNA, and some differ by only one or
two nucleotides. As family members are predicted to regulate
overlapping sets of target genes, it may be advantageous to be
able to target multiple family members with a single ASO.
Alternatively, there may be situations in which targeting
a single family member is desired. Measuring levels and
activities of multiple related miRNAs is technically challen-
ging, but we can infer from the specificity of ASOs mis-
matched to miR-21 the likelihood of targeting multiple
family members with a single ASO. A total of 1 to 6 nt mis-
matches were introduced into 20-O-MOE-PS ASOs at a num-
ber of positions, and anti-miR-21 activity was measured 24 h
after treatment (Figure 5A). Three of four ASOs evaluated
with a single mismatch substantially reduced, but did not
ablate, anti-miR-21 activity. The introduction of a single
mismatch into the 30 end of the ASO, which is complementary
to the 50 seed region of the miRNA, resulted in an additional
loss of activity relative to the other ASOs containing a single
mismatch. ASOs with two or more mismatches to miR-21 had
poor activity, and three or more mismatches resulted in a
complete loss of activity. These data suggest that anti-miRNA
ASOs are likely to be specific for individual miRNA family
members.
We also tested the effect of truncation on the ASOs’ anti-
miRNA activity. 20-O-MOE-PS ASOs with one to five trun-
cated nucleotides from either the 50 or 30 end were evaluated
for their ability to inhibit miR-21 activity (Figure 5B). A 1 nt
truncation from either end of the ASO was well tolerated with

PTEN incorporating high-affinity modifications at various positions in the passenger strand. These modified passenger strands were each paired with an RNA guide
strand, and the ability of each duplex (12 nM) to down regulate PTEN mRNA was measured using real-time RT–PCR. The 20-sugar and backbone modification

little loss of activity. Interestingly, truncating a single nucle-
otide from the 30 end of the ASO modestly improved activity.
In this case, the truncated nucleotide would be complementary
to the first nucleotide of the miRNA, which is supposed to be
tucked into a pocket of the Piwi domain of the Argonaute
protein in RISC and not available to interact with target
RNA (86,87). Truncating 2 nucleotides from either end of
the ASO resulted in a loss of activity, although again a trun-
cation from the 30 end was better tolerated than a truncation
from the 50 end. Three or more truncations from either end
resulted in a substantial loss of anti-miRNA activity.
Effect of inhibition of miRNA activity on miRNA levels
Degradation of the mature miRNA has been reported after
in vivo inhibition of miR-122 with uniformly 20-substituted
ASOs (15,16). To test if the same effect was observed in vitro,
we examined the effect of ASO inhibition on miR-21 levels in
Hela cells after ASO treatment (Figure 6). There was a dose-
dependent decrease in the levels of miR-21 detected on a
northern blot 24 h after treatment with the 20-O-MOE-PS
ASO targeting miR-21, but not with a control ASO, indicating
that degradation of the mature miRNA also occurred in vitro
and on a similar time frame as the changes in luciferase sensor
activity that we observed.
DISCUSSION
In this study we set out to identify the optimal modified
chemistries for inhibition of miRNA activity by ASOs. Few
miRNAs have been assigned any function, and antisense
oligos are a convenient method for inhibiting them.
Antisense targeting may be the only possible approach for

therapeutically inhibiting miRNAs, since the active molecule
is a small RNA, which will be challenging to target specific-
ally without using Watson–Crick base pairing. Therefore,
identifying optimal chemistries for miRNA inhibition is cru-
cial for effective functionalization and therapeutic targeting
of miRNAs.
The ASOs evaluated in this study are complementary to
mature miR-21, but could interfere with miRNA processing
by binding to pri- or pre-miRNA. They could also act after
Dicer processing, but before loading of the mature miRNA
into Argonaute. At least one study suggested that ASOs tar-
geting miRNA act primarily by binding to the mature miRNA
and blocking its function in RISC (59). Krutzfeldt et al. (15)
reported in vivo reduction of mature miR-122 with no effect on
pre-miR-122 levels, also pointing to the mature miRNA as
the primary site of action of the ASO. Two observations in
this study are consistent with this model. First, inhibition
of miRNA activity and reduction of mature miRNA levels
occurred within 24 h. There is evidence to suggest that
RISC-loaded mature miRNA is long-lived, as inhibition of
Drosha processing, pre-miRNA nuclear export, or the PACT
protein shown to be involved in RISC loading, had minimal
effects on the steady-state levels of mature miRNAs (88–91).
If the ASO were inhibiting miRNA processing or loading,
effects on miRNA activity would not be observed until turn-
over of the RISC-loaded mature miRNA. Second, the correla-
tion in Table 2 between active miRNA ASOs and poor siRNA
passenger strands implies that the ASO is acting at the site of
passenger strand unwinding, which has been reported to be in
RISC (81–85). Thus, while we cannot rule out the possibility
that the ASO inhibits miRNA processing or RISC loading, our
data and others so far suggest the ASO acts primarily on
mature miRNA in RISC.
The initial set of modified ASOs was designed to evaluate
the role of affinity in anti-miRNA ASO activity. In the context
of a PS modified backbone, the degree of miRNA inhibition
correlated loosely with affinity. The two modifications with
the highest Tm’s, uniform 2
0-F and the 20-LNA/MOE mixed
sugar, were most active. The 20-O-Me and 20-O-MOE substi-
tuted ASOs had similarly reduced Tm’s and were less active at
inhibition of miR-21 activity, although the 20-O-Me-PS ASO
was less active than expected based on affinity alone. Uniform
DNA had the lowest Tm and was inactive. Replacement of a
PS backbone modification with the diester, which should
improve target affinity, resulted in an increase in activity
for the 20-O-MOE ASOs, but gave little or no improvement
in activity for a 20-O-Me ASO. This result was not surprising
for the 20-O-Me-PO ASO as this modification is rapidly
degraded in cells and little to no cellular activity for ASOs
containing 20-O-Me residues with PO linkages has been
reported (76,79). The timecourse data are consistent with
this, as the 20-O-MOE-PO and 20-O-Me-PO ASOs showed
similar activity at early timepoints, but the 20-O-MOE-PO
was much more active at later timepoints. Although 20-O-
Me-PS oligonucleotides are less resistant to degradation
than 20-O-MOE-PS oligonucleotides, ASOs with this modi-
fication are active in cellular assays (76,79). The unexpectedly
reduced activity of the 20-O-Me-PS ASO compared to the
20-O-MOE-PS ASO in this miR-21 sensor assay was not likely
only due to degradation.
That discrepancy, and the difference in activity between the
20-O-MOE/20-deoxy hemimer ASOs in spite of their almost
identical Tm’s, suggested that in some cases, more than affinity
determined effective miRNA inhibition. This led us to the
speculation that an anti-miRNA ASO, if it is acting primarily
on mature miRNA in RISC, is analogous to a passenger strand
of an siRNA or miRNA. Perhaps the same rules governing
tolerability of chemical modification of siRNA passenger
strands also hold true for modified anti-miRNA ASOs. Indeed,
this is what we found. There was, generally speaking,
an inverse correlation of PTEN siRNA activity with anti-
miR-21 activity for each modified passenger strand/miRNA
ASO. The best anti-miRNA ASO tested, the uniformly modi-
fied 20-O-MOE-PO, was completely inactive as a PTEN
siRNA passenger strand. The least active anti-miRNA
ASOs, the MOE-DNA-MOE gapmer, and the alternating
MOE-DNA motif, were the most active siRNA passenger
strands. These data support the hypothesis that a similar mech-
anism could be involved in dissociation of an siRNA passen-
ger strand and dissociation of an anti-miRNA ASO, which
would result in ineffective inhibition of miRNA activity. It
remains to be seen whether this hypothesis will be useful for
predicting additional designs for active anti-miRNA ASOs.
Theoretically, the 20-O-MOE gapmer ASO targeting the
mature miRNA sequence could inhibit miRNA activity via
an RNase H-based mechanism, acting on the mature, pre-
or pri-miRNA. However, we observed little anti-miRNA
activity in the luciferase sensor assay with the 20-O-MOE
gapmer. It is likely that the mature miRNA in RISC is not
accessible to the RNase H enzyme. The possibility that the
20-O-MOE gapmer ASO could target the pri- or pre-miRNA is
still open, since this would inhibit production of new mature
miRNA. Any measurable effects would depend on the rate of
turnover of the already present mature miRNA, which may not
be observable in the time-frame of these assays, as the half-life
of mature miRNA is thought to be long (88–91). In addition,
the mature miRNA is found in a structured hairpin in the pri-
and pre-miRNA, and structured hairpin targets tend to reduce
ASO activity (92). Targeting the pri-miRNA transcript outside
the hairpin structure may be a better strategy for ASOs using
an RNase H mechanism. Targeting the pri-miRNA transcript
with siRNA is not likely to be an option, since pri-miRNA

MOE-PS miR-21 ASO. miR-21 ASO or a control ASO were transfected into
Hela cells and levels of miR-21 were measured 24 h later. A control experiment
in which miR-21 ASO was spiked into Hela cell lysates showed that the ASO
did not interfere with miR-21 detection (spike). Cells mock transfected with
low-serum media only (Optimem) or with media containing the transfection
reagent (Lipofectin) also showed no reduction in miR-21 levels.

transcripts are found primarily in the nucleus, and siRNA
targeting of pre-miRNAs has been reported to be inefficient,
requiring much higher doses of siRNA than usually needed
for targeting mRNAs (60). RNase H ASOs, on the other hand,
have successfully been used to target noncoding RNAs in the
nucleus (93).
These studies outline some of the factors important for
effective targeting of miRNA with ASOs in cell culture.
We evaluated effects of 20-sugar and backbone ASO modi-
fications, and their placement within the ASO. While affinity
for the target miRNA was the most important determinant of
anti-miRNA activity, our results suggested that to be an effect-
ive miRNA ASO, it may also be necessary to avoid dissoci-
ation by the factors responsible for si/miRNA passenger strand
unwinding. Mismatches were not well tolerated, suggesting
it will be difficult to target multiple miRNA family members
with a single ASO. Truncation studies indicated that although
significant activity was retained with truncation of just 1 nt,
loss of two or more nucleotides resulted in a substantial loss
of anti-miRNA activity.
These studies focused on a single miRNA in a single assay
system. It will be essential to extend these studies to target
other miRNAs, with other assays for miRNA activity. As
several natural targets for miRNAs have now been identified,
it will be possible to perform studies that measure ASO effects
on miRNA target protein or mRNA levels directly. In addition,
other factors will have to be considered in optimizing in vivo
anti-miRNA activity for therapeutic targeting, as the pharma-
cokinetic properties of an ASO can dramatically influence
its effectiveness in an animal. Data from in vivo targeting
of miR-122 suggested that the outcome of miRNA ASO
inhibition is degradation of the mature miRNA (15,16), and
we also observed reduction in miR-21 levels after inhibition
with a 20-O-MOE-PS ASO in these studies. It’s not clear how
ASO binding to a miRNA in RISC results in disappearance
of the mature miRNA, but understanding the mechanism of
degradation may lead to more effective methods of miRNA
targeting, and it will be an important question for future
studies.
