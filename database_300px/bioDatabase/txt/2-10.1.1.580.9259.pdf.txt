ABSTRACT
Translation termination in eukaryotes is completed
by two interacting factors eRF1 and eRF3. In
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these proteins are
encoded by the genes SUP45 and SUP35, respec-
tively. The eRF1 protein interacts directly with the
stop codon at the ribosomal A-site, whereas
eRF3—a GTPase protein—probably acts as a proof-
reading factor, coupling stop codon recognition to
polypeptide chain release. We performed random
PCR mutagenesis of SUP45 and screened the library
for mutations resulting in increased eRF1 activity.
These mutations led to the identification of two
new pockets in domain 1 (P1 and P2) involved in
the regulation of eRF1 activity. Furthermore, we
identified novel mutations located in domains 2
and 3, which confer stop codon specificity to
eRF1. Our findings are consistent with the model
of a closed-active conformation of eRF1 and shed
light on two new functional regions of the protein.
INTRODUCTION
Translation termination occurs when one of the three stop
codons, UAA, UGA and UAG, enters the ribosomal
A-site. In eukaryotes, two release factors eRF1 and
eRF3 mediate translation termination. Either full or par-
tial X-ray structures are available for both proteins (1,2).
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eRF1 is encoded by the gene
SUP45. This protein recognizes all three stop codons
through an extended surface including the NIKS motif
in its N-terminal domain (3–5) and triggers peptidyl–
tRNA hydrolysis by activating the peptidyl transferase
center of the ribosome through the highly conserved
GGQ motif in the central domain of eRF1. The
C-terminal domain of eRF1 is involved in binding
eRF3, which is essential for in vivo termination (6). The
precise molecular mechanisms underlying this process
remain unclear, but it is possible that the binding of
eRF1 to eRF3 induces a conformational change in
eRF3 to stabilize the binding of GTP to eRF3 (7). The
S. cerevisiae eRF3 protein, encoded by SUP35 gene, is
composed of two diﬀerent regions. The N-terminal
region (called NM) speciﬁc to S. cerevisiae is not necessary
for termination activity but is involved in the formation of
prion-like polymers known as [PSI+]. The C-terminal
region is highly conserved and is involved both in GTP
and eRF1 binding. eRF1 binding to eRF3 is required for
GTP binding. The ternary complex eRF1:eRF3:GTP may
bind the ribosomal A-site, but the binding of GTP to
eRF3 prevents eRF1 from catalyzing termination. If a
stop codon is located in the A-site, a conformational rear-
rangement would occur and stimulate eRF3 GTPase
activity (4). GTP hydrolysis allows proper positioning of
the eRF1 GGQ motif in the peptidyl transferase center to
catalyze peptidyl–tRNA cleavage (8,9).
Many studies have investigated eRF1 speciﬁcity for stop
codons. However, most of these studies screened for eRF1
mutants with reduced termination eﬃciency (3,5,10–14).
We developed a new approach based on the use of a
weak stop codon to determine the role of the various
eRF1 domains. Such a stop codon is easily suppressed
by natural tRNAs, allowing a high rate of stop codon
readthrough in a wild-type genetic background (15,16).
We screened a random PCR mutagenesis library of the
SUP45 gene to identify hyperactive mutants, using a
method previously developed in our laboratory (17)
(Figure 1 and Figure S1). Our study demonstrates that
all the domains of the protein are involved in regulating
termination eﬃciency. Moreover, we identiﬁed novel
mutations in domains 2 and 3, which speciﬁcally improve
termination at the UAA and UAG codons but have no
eﬀect on the UGA codon.

(378C). The modiﬁed FS1-TMV strain used for the screen
was constructed as described in Supplementary Data. We
generated an FS1 strain with deletion of the sup45 gene
(FS1S) as indicated in Supplementary Data. Strains
were grown in minimal media supplemented with the
appropriate amino acids for maintenance of the diﬀerent
plasmids after transformation. Yeast transformations
were performed using the lithium acetate method (18).
Plasmids and molecular biology methods
Mutagenesis. Random mutagenesis was carried out by
PCR on a pUC19 vector with the SUP45 gene cloned at
the SmaI site as indicated in Supplementary Data.
Western blot. Protein samples were separated on SDS–
polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred
to nitrocellulose. Antibodies raised against eRF1 or
actin (MAB1501R, clone C4, Chemicon) were used.
Quantification of readthrough efficiency
Clones transformed with pHS-Sup45 constructs were then
transformed with a dual reporter plasmid to quantify ter-
mination eﬃciency at each stop codon. Luciferase and
b-galactosidase activities were assayed in the same crude
extract as previously described (19). All reported values
represent the median of at least ﬁve independent measure-
ments, with 20% of standard error. The signiﬁcance of
variation was evaluated using a non-parametric statistical
test to calculate a P-value (Mann–Whitney).
Computational analysis of eRF1 structure
Structural pictures were visualized with Pymol from
DeLano (http://www.pymol.org) using either the surface
or cartoon visualization mode. Hydrogen bonds were
modeled using the tool, ‘ﬁnd polar contacts’.
Electrostatic views were generated using APBS Pymol
plugging within a range of 5 kT (red) to +5 kT (blue).
RESULTS
Screening for hyperactive eRF1 mutants
We used a screen based on the ability to monitor the ter-
mination eﬃciency of a stop codon cloned into the ADE2
gene by assessing the color of yeast colonies (Figure S1).
ADE2 encodes the P-ribosyl-amino–imidazole carboxylase
(EC 4.1.1.21), responsible for the degradation of the red
pigment amino–imidazole ribotide. We previously show
that more than 10% of readthrough at the ADE2 gene is
suﬃcient to switch the color from red to white (17). The
screen is performed in a strain carrying the wild-type
SUP45 gene and a chromosomal copy of the ade2 gene
interrupted by an in-frame UAG stop codon at a weak
termination site promoting 30% of readthrough (see
Material and methods section). We carried out three inde-
pendent random PCR mutagenesis experiments with dif-
ferent conditions on the wild-type SUP45 gene. These
PCR products were inserted into the pFL44L plasmid
(URA3) by gap repair and transformed directly into the
reporter strain. Transformants were plated onto minimal
medium supplemented with CSM containing a minimum
quantity of adenine to allow healthy growth with optimi-
zation of the red color.
After 5 days at 308C, we selected 46 red-colored clones
among a large number of white transformants. Plasmids
were counter-selected on 5-FOA medium. All but one
clone reversed the phenotype indicating they were antisup-
pressor sup45 mutants.
Identification of sup45 mutations
We sequenced the SUP45 coding sequence of the candi-
dates, to identify mutations present in the gene. One hun-
dred and thirty-one mutations were identiﬁed equally
distributed along the gene (Figure 1). Interestingly, how-
ever, there were no mutations in the ‘GGQ’ domain.
Mutations resulting in a change in the amino-acid compo-
sition of eRF1 are presented in Table SII. The average
number of all mutations in each coding sequence was
2.9, including 30 silent mutations. We focused our study
on candidates presenting either a low number of muta-
tions or mutations identiﬁed several times during the
screen (Table 1). Most mutations were found in domain
1 (1–140), which interacts directly with the stop codon.
Among the 34 mutations found in domain 1, 20 modiﬁed
the charge of the amino acid, replacing a negative or
uncharged amino acid by a positively charged one
(R, K or H). Among the ﬁve mutations found in
domain 2 (141–275), four mutations (N261, I211, D214,
I248) were at the interface with the domain 1. In the only
X-ray structure of eRF1 currently available (PDB 1DT9),
the structure of domain 3 (276–437) is incomplete; thus,
we were unable to localize all mutations in the 3D struc-
ture (Figure 1). Taking into account mutations that were
unique or found in at least two independent clones,
12 mutated positions in domain 1, three positions in
domain 2 and ﬁve positions in domain 3 were found.
Hyperactive sup45 mutants can complement the deletion of
wild-type SUP45
We carried out our genetic screen in the presence of the
wild-type SUP45 gene. Translational elongation mutants
with an elevated level of translational accuracy interfere
with cell viability (20). Termination mutants with an ele-
vated level of accuracy may thus severely aﬀect yeast
growth rate. To determine the potential eﬀects of these
mutant proteins on growth, we constructed a yeast
strain deleted for SUP45 (FS1S) rescued by a URA3
plasmid bearing wild-type SUP45. We selected a subset
of mutants carrying only a single mutation, or a combi-
nation of these single mutations, for this analysis. The
FS1S strain was then transformed with the mutant con-
structs and the wild-type SUP45 gene was shuﬄed. Our
results (Figure 2) clearly demonstrated that all the mutant
cells were viable at 308C. However, all three double
mutants were thermosensitive.
Variation in the expression of sup45 mutants does not
account for the phenotypes observed
A change in the nature of an amino acid can modify the
activity or the stability of a protein. It has been previously

reported that a depletion in the level of eRF1 causes a
reduction in termination eﬃciency, indicating that the
amount of eRF1 is important for ensuring eﬃcient termi-
nation in yeast (21). In our study, an increase of eRF1
stability would result in a higher concentration of protein
available for termination in the cytoplasm. This could
explain the anti-suppressor phenotype observed.
We quantiﬁed the levels of the 14 most interesting
mutant proteins in the FS1S strain deleted for the chro-
mosomal copy of SUP45, by western blot. All the mutants
but A16 were equally stable (Figure 3). Both FS1 and A16
strains display a signiﬁcant variation of the eRF1 level.
This was expected for the FS1 strain carrying only the
chromosomal copy of the SUP45 gene. It is worth to
note that increase in eRF1 level due to its overexpression
(column WT in Figure 3) does not aﬀect stop codon read-
through as previously published (22). However, results for
the mutant A16 (K276E, E345V) are puzzling. Despite the
low level of eRF1, the mutant is viable and does not show
any obvious phenotype. One would expect an increase of

stop codon readthrough in this strain due to the low level
of eRF1, but the opposite occurs with a 2-fold reduction
readthrough eﬃciency. This suggests that the mutant is
very active and the eﬀect on termination is underestimated
due to the low level of eRF1 in the cell.
Sup45 mutants display significantly increased translation
termination efficiency
To determine whether translation termination rate was
actually increased in these mutants, we quantiﬁed stop
codon readthrough in the FS1S strain using the pAC
reporter plasmids bearing a leaky UAA, UAG or UGA
stop codon at the lacZ-luc junction (19,23). A stronger
termination eﬃciency can be observed by a decrease of
stop codon readthrough eﬃciency. The readthrough
level was quantiﬁed and compared to that obtained in
the presence of the pFL44L vector bearing the SUP45
wild-type gene. We measured the eﬀect of 17 mutants on
translation termination ﬁdelity using the three diﬀerent
stop codons (Table 2). These results show that termination

eﬃciency was signiﬁcantly higher for all the mutants. The
readthrough levels for UAA, UAG and UGA codons in
the presence of the SUP45 WT gene were 16%, 34% and
22%, respectively. These values are consistent with pre-
viously published values (17,24). The two clones A8 and
C11 carry mutations in domain 1 at positions 104 and 58,
respectively. C11 carries a change at the ﬁrst amino acid
of the stop codon recognition sequence NIKS (N58K).
These mutated sequences were able to confer a substantial
increase in translational termination eﬃciency at all three
stop codons; the rate of stop codon readthrough was
between three and six times lower than that of wild-type
Sup45p. The mutant C15 carries the same mutation as A8,
together with mutations C299S and I326N. These two
mutants had approximately the same eﬀect, suggesting
that the mutation E104K was responsible for the observed
phenotype. Both B1 and C6 had mutations at position 76,
replacing Gln by Arg or Lys, respectively. Stop codon
readthrough was four times lower in B1, and six to eight
times lower in C6 than in wild-type (Table 2). These two
mutants carry a positively charged residue rather than the
uncharged Gln. In comparison, the presence of both the
Q76K and K340E mutations in the A13 clone had a
weaker eﬀect than the single mutation Q76K alone (C6)
(Table 2). These data suggest that Q76K alone contributes
to improved termination eﬃciency. The two other single
mutants tested were A2 and B3, bearing E360V and
E360G mutations, respectively. A strong eﬀect was

observed for UAA and UGA in A2, their rates of read-
through being ﬁve times lower than in wild-type. Similar
patterns of anti-suppression were observed for all three
stop codons in B3, with a 3-fold reduction in readthrough.
This mutation was found in mutants C1 and C2, both of
which also carried additional mutations. Unlike the
mutant with only a single mutation, these two mutants
did not display the same behavior for each of the diﬀerent
stop codons (Table 2). These diﬀerent eﬀects may thus be
a result of the additional mutations. A 2–3-fold reduction
in readthrough eﬃciency was observed for the mutant A4,
which carries mutations in both domain 1 (N27H) and
domain 3 (K331N). Among mutants with more signiﬁcant
reductions, C3 had a readthrough eﬃciency four to six
times lower than that of wild-type (Table 2). This
mutant carried three diﬀerent mutations, one in domain
1 and two in domain 3. A cooperative eﬀect of these three
mutations may underlie the strong eﬀect observed.
Alternatively, given that we found the mutation I387V
independently in three other mutants, this mutation
could be the main determinant of hyperactivity in this
mutant. A19 showed the largest reduction in readthrough
eﬃciency in our screen. Readthrough of UAA and UGA
codons was 10 and 14 times lower, respectively, in this
mutant than in wild-type. This mutant had mutations at
two positions; but only one (position 50) was identifed in
another mutant (A9, Table SII). A16 and C12, both car-
rying mutations in domains 3 and 2, were of particular
interest because they displayed unusual stop codon speci-
ﬁcity. Both mutants had increased termination eﬃciency
at UAA and UAG, but not at UGA.
Mutations found in domain 1 can be divided into two
main groups, the pocket 1 (P1) and the pocket 2 (P2)
(Table 1). To strengthen our data regarding the impor-
tance of these pockets we constructed by direct mutagen-
esis two single mutations (D96E in P1; T50K in P2)
originally identiﬁed in double mutants. Results presented
in Table 3 indicate that both single mutants increase ter-
mination at all stop codons. This clearly conﬁrms our
ﬁnding that P1 and P2 play an essential role in eRF1
function. However, the eﬀects of the single mutants are
weaker than the one observed in the initial double
mutants. This clearly indicated that the second mutation
also aﬀects termination. This was already known for the
E360G mutation found together with D96E, as this
mutant is also identiﬁed alone, but not for N379Y (iden-
tiﬁed with T50K).
It remains to be determined whether mutations in the
diﬀerent domains increase termination eﬃciency through
diﬀerent mechanisms. If this was the case, these mutants
would be expected to display increased eﬃciency at diﬀer-
ent stages of termination; such mutations may then have a
cumulative eﬀect. We constructed a set of double mutants
all containing the mutation E360G in domain 3 (B3) with
each of three mutations identiﬁed in diﬀerent regions of
domain 1, E104K, Q76R or N58K. These new mutants
were called sup45-EE/KG, sup45-QE/RG and sup45-NE/
KG, accordingly. The eﬀect observed for sup45-EE/KG
did not diﬀer from that observed for the two single
mutants (Table 3). The mutant sup45-QE/RG displayed
a cumulative eﬀect on termination at the UAA codon
(7-fold reduction in readthrough) and a multiplicative
eﬀect at UGA (10-fold), whereas no eﬀect was observed
for the UAG codon. Cumulative eﬀects on both UAG
(6-fold) and UGA (8-fold) codons, but not on the UAA
codon, were observed for the mutant sup45-NE/KG
(Table 3).
Mutations are present in highly conserved domains
The eRF1 family is highly conserved; however, subtle
changes are found throughout the proteins and several
of the mutations aﬀect highly conserved residues
(Figure S2). An asparagine at position 27 in domain 1 is
present in all sequences with the exception of Tetrahymena
thermophila (yeast numbering). This Asn27 is at 6 A˚
from Asn126 in the adjacent Tyr122-Phe128 loop,
which is essential for stop codon discrimination (11)
(Figure S3A). Moreover, Asn27, together with residues

Moreover the importance of the Asn27 loop is reinforced
by the fact that GTS residues immediately downstream
from Asn27 are conserved in all eRF1 proteins
(Figure 1). Position 51 is occupied by negatively charged
residues only and is located in the external side of the helix
2 (Figure S3A). This part of the protein is thought to be in
close interaction with both the ribosomal RNA and
mRNA, the replacement of this polar amino acid by
either a positively charged or aromatic amino acid is
likely to strengthen the interactions between eRF1 and
the ribosome. The Asn58 lies within the NIKSR loop,
which contacts the uridine of the stop codon, and is cru-
cial for eRF1 activity (25) (Figure S3A). Modiﬁcation of
this motif aﬀects stop codon recognition (5,13). To our
knowledge, substitution of Asn58 by a lysine has not
been previously reported. It is possible that the interaction
of the negatively charged mRNA with the positively
charged lysine residue will be stronger than with the Asn
residue. The residence time of eRF1 in the A-site would
then be extended and termination signiﬁcantly increased.
Positions 101 and 104 are mostly occupied by acidic resi-
dues in the diﬀerent species. These amino acids are local-
ized at the surface of the protein. Notably, Asp101 lies
close to the P1 domain. We identiﬁed mutations at each
of the three residues of P1 (Asn27, Asp96 and Glu104),
highlighting the importance of this domain in the transla-
tion termination mechanism.
All three mutations identiﬁed in domain 2 (N161I,
I211V and D214G) aﬀect highly conserved positions.
Alignment of 14 wild-type eRF1 sequences revealed vari-
ation at these positions in only one sequence in each case
(Figure S2). I211 and D214 are highly conserved, despite
lying in the most variable region of domain 2.
Among the ﬁve mutations identiﬁed in domain 3, two
were at highly conserved positions. The Val, Lys or Asp
residues replacing Glu at position 315, which is conserved
across all the species considered, have not been found to
occur naturally at this location. Furthermore, we identi-
ﬁed mutations in seven diﬀerent clones at position 360,
replacing Glu by neutral amino acids Val or Gly, despite
this position being occupied by a negatively charged
amino acid in all wild-type sequences. Notably, both posi-
tions 315 and 360 lie in the most variable region domain 3.
This variability may indicate that this domain has
co-evolved with variable regions of eRF3, which binds
eRF1 speciﬁcally at this domain.
DISCUSSION
Both release factors eRF1 and eRF3 are key components
of the termination process. The eRF1 protein can be
divided into three functional domains. Domain 1 binds
the stop codon directly in the ribosomal A-site. Domain
2 interacts with the peptidyl transferase center leading to
the hydrolysis of the last peptidyl-tRNA bond through the
GGQ motif (10,26). Little structural data is available for
domain 3, however, in S. pombe, the last 11 residues are
necessary for the binding of eRF3 (6,27–29). We devel-
oped an original approach to identify new mutants dis-
playing an anti-suppressor phenotype in a wild-type
genetic background by taking advantage of the weak
termination eﬃciency of stop codons present in read-
through sequences. Using this screen, we identiﬁed 131
mutations distributed throughout the SUP45 gene. All
single mutants were viable at either 308C or 378C in a
strain carrying deletion of SUP45 and did not display
any obvious phenotype. Thus, the increase in termination
eﬃciency had no deleterious eﬀect on yeast viability.
However, these mutants were not viable in the absence
of eRF3, demonstrating that these mutations do not com-
pensate for loss of eRF3 by directly activating eRF1 (data
not shown). We demonstrated most of the mutants had an
equal amount of eRF1 protein and showed a substantial
increase in termination eﬃciency, demonstrating a direct
eﬀect on termination mechanisms. Moreover, we showed
that the combination of single mutations, identiﬁed sepa-
rately in domains 1 and 3, aﬀects termination eﬃciency
diﬀerently, depending on the mutations and stop codon
involved. These ﬁndings suggest that mutations in the var-
ious domains modify termination eﬃciency through their
eﬀects on diﬀerent mechanisms. We were able to localize
these mutations on the 3D structure of the human eRF1
using Pymol software (see Materials and methods section).
All mutations found in domains 1 and 2 appear to modify
the surface of the protein, whereas the mutations found
in domain 3 have negligible eﬀects on the surface of the
protein (Figure S4). Mutations located in domain 1 are
subdivided into three distinct groups (Figure 4). The ﬁrst
group (aﬀecting Asn27, Asp96 and Glu104) constitutes a
pocket 1 (P1) at the top of this domain (Figure 4A), lying
very close to the regions directly involved in the stop
codon recognition. A ‘pocket model’ has been proposed
for stop codon recognition by eRF1 (4,11). An important
feature of this model is the H-bond formed between resi-
dues Glu55 and Tyr122, which would maintain the two
remote regions of domain 1 (the two NIKS domain-con-
taining helices, and the beta-strand on the opposite side,
represented in dark blue in Figure S3) in close proximity
to each other. The new region P1 is continuous with this
functional area. Both these regions could together accom-
modate the mRNA for proper orientation of eRF1 in the
A-site. As observed in Figure 4, the introduction of either
His or Tyr at position 27 should exert a similar structural
bulk eﬀect on the protein surface. These mutations would
deepen pocket 1 and probably strengthen interactions with
the helix domain.
The residues aﬀected by group 2 mutations (Gln46,
Thr50, Gln76), together with Lys80, deﬁne a second
pocket (P2) (Figure 4B). A direct role of P2 in stop
codon recognition is unlikely as the residues are located
too far away from the eRF1 mRNA-binding site. How-
ever, we found mutations involving three of four residues
constituting P2. In particular, A19 (T50K, N379Y), for
which we observed the strongest eﬀect on readthrough,
carried a mutation at position T50 of P2. Moreover muta-
tions T50K and Q76K alone induced a 6-fold and 6- to
8-fold reduction in readthrough respectively, which are
the strongest eﬀects observed for single mutations. This
highlights the crucial role of this region in termination
eﬃciency (Figure 4B). It is worth noting that an arginine
residue at position 76 creates a steric clash with Lys80
(Figure 4B), probably inducing a structural change of

this part of domain 1. Furthermore, all the mutations
found in P2 modify the charge of the residues by adding
a positive charge (Q46K, T50K, Q76R/K). This strongly
suggests that the electrostatics charges of this region are
important for the observed improvement in eRF1 activity.
When eRF1 is in the A-site, it probably interacts with the
rRNA (30–32). We proposed that this electropositive side
of domain 1 (Figure S5) interacts with the rRNA and that
the P2 region plays a central role in these interactions. It
would then follow that hyperactive mutations in P2
increase the residence time of eRF1 in the A-site and thus
promote termination, whereas mutations in P1 probably
aﬀect the binding or recognition of the stop codon itself.
Group 3 comprises two mutations located at the bottom
of domain 1 opposite the top part of the domain 2.
These two mutations (Lys115 and Lys87) both point in
the direction of domain 2 (Figure S2B). However, the
crystal structure reveals these residues to be too far
away from other amino acids to form a hydrogen bond.
This crystal structure of eRF1 is unlikely to represent the
active structure of eRF1 bound to ribosome (2). Indeed,
the NIKS and GGQ domains are separated by 100 A˚ in
the crystal structure, whereas the distance between the
codon in the A-site and the peptidyl center is around
73 A˚. A conformational change has been modeled to
create a closed form, which ﬁts the range needed for func-
tional binding of eRF1 within the ribosome (33). The
closed conformation of eRF1 involves motion of domain
2 relative to other domains. This conformational reorga-
nization would, for example, bring the Asp141 to within

approximately 4 A˚ of the Lys115, whereas these residues
are separated by 13 A˚ in the open conformation
(Figure S3C). However, due to approximations in the
modeled eRF1-closed conformation, these observations
should be carefully interpreted. The distance between
Lys and Arg in this new model is in the range allowing
formation of hydrogen bonds. We propose that H-bond
formation between the mutated residues and the hinge
region (or the surface of domain 2) would stabilize the
closed conformation, locking eRF1 in its active conforma-
tion. This would explain the increased translation termina-
tion eﬃciency observed for the single mutants. Similarly,
the three mutations identiﬁed in domain 2 were all located
on the same side of this domain, opposite domain 1.
Nussinov and colleagues (33) also showed that neutraliza-
tion of the electrostatic repulsions between domains 1
and 2 by histidine protonation is required for the closed
conformation. Two of the three mutations change a
charged residue to a neutral residue. These substitutions
may therefore help to lower the repulsion between domains
1 and 2, promoting the transition from the inactive
open conformation to the active closed conformation.
As mentioned above, structural analysis of the muta-
tions in domain 3 is diﬃcult because the available struc-
ture for domain 3 is incomplete. Indeed, mutations
E360V/G, found in seven independent mutants, are
located in one of the missing regions. All the remaining
mutations do not appear to aﬀect the surface of the pro-
tein, but probably aﬀect the general conformation of the
domain. For example, the replacement of a Cys by a Trp
residue at position 299 creates a steric clash with helix 9.
The resulting movement of either helix 9, or the Trp res-
idue is likely to aﬀect the overall structure of domain 3.
Domain 3 is the binding site of eRF3; thus, mutations in
this domain could promote termination by increasing the
likelihood of eRF3 binding to eRF1. Alternatively, these
mutations may allow stronger binding of eRF1 to the
ribosome by altering the overall shape of the release
factor. The two variant alleles expressed in A16 and C12
signiﬁcantly increased termination eﬃciency at UAA and
UAG codons but had no eﬀect on the UGA codon. We
identiﬁed several point mutations in these two mutants—
K276E and E345V and L21I, N209K and E315V—
respectively. Both mutations in A16 were located in
domain 3. We found mutations at Glu315 in four diﬀerent
mutants. This mutation is therefore likely to be relevant
for termination. However, we did not identify any single
mutants with a mutation at position 315 only; so the
eﬀects on termination eﬃciency observed may have been
due to the presence of several mutations. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of eRF1 mutations
located outside domain 1 aﬀecting the speciﬁcity of stop
codon recognition. Biochemical analysis of these mutants
will help to determine which step of the termination pro-
cess is aﬀected.
The comparison of the potential functional conse-
quences between these various mutations is of particular
interest. We created a series of double mutants combining
mutations identiﬁed in three diﬀerent areas of domain 1
with the most frequent mutation found in domain 3
(E360G). The ﬁrst double mutant EE/KG, carrying both
the E104K (P1) and E360G mutations, did not display any
synergistic eﬀect between the two mutations on termina-
tion eﬃciency at any of the stop codons. Thus, these two
mutations probably aﬀect a common step in termination.
The second double mutant (sup45-QE/RG) carried the
Q76R (from B1, P2) mutation associated with E360G
(from B3) and demonstrated an additive eﬀect of these
two mutations compared to the single mutations.
However, the eﬀect observed on termination at the
UAG codon was equivalent to that observed in the
mutant with Q76R alone. Notably, the mutant T50K
N379Y, showing the strongest eﬀect observed for termi-
nation eﬃciency, showed a much less marked eﬀect on the
UAG stop codon than on the two other stop codons.
Thus, diﬀerent regions of eRF1 seem to be involved in
termination, depending on the stop codon present in the
A site. The third mutant (sup45-NE/KG) carried the
N58K mutation (from C11) with E360G. This mutant
showed a cumulative eﬀect for both UAG and UGA
stop codons. This suggests that mutations in domains 1
and 3 act on termination through diﬀerent mechanisms.
These ﬁndings provide support for the three mutations in
domain 1 aﬀecting diﬀerent steps of the termination.
We exploited the use of a stop codon at a weak termi-
nation site to search for release factor 1 mutants with a
greater activity than wild-type. These mutant proteins
inevitably adopt a functional conformation, so their
eﬀects cannot be explained by prevention of correct fold-
ing of the protein. We identiﬁed and characterized two
previously unknown regions involved in termination.
This powerful approach can be easily extended to study
proteins involved in other translational mechanisms such
as frameshifting.
Our ﬁndings strengthen the previous study suggesting
that eRF3 may act as a proofreading factor by coupling
stop codon recognition by eRF1 to eﬃcient polypeptide
chain release (8). Moreover, our study suggests that the
termination process is a multistep reaction. Understanding
how these mutations aﬀect the interactions between ribo-
some and eRF1 will be a major step in further character-
ization of the termination process in eukaryotes. This will
help to design drugs that prevent eRF1 from acting on
premature stop codons, allowing the re-expression of
genes inactivated by a nonsense mutation (34). Atomic
resolution structures have been solved for prokaryotic fac-
tors; it is hoped that similar structures of eRF1 in a com-
plex with the ribosome will be solved in the future and will
help to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms under-
lying termination.
