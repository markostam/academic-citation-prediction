Abstract
We investigate the breakup process of a falling inviscid liquid sheet in the absence of surrounding ﬂuids. Analy-
sis is based on the unsteady nonlinear equations derived under the membrane approximation. Particular boundary
conditions upstream are numerically found for non-oscillatory steady and stable solutions. When unsteady modu-
lational waves propagate on such a steady ﬂow, weakly nonlinear analysis shows that only the antisymmetric mode
is ampliﬁed propagating downstream; from it the symmetric mode is additionally induced. On the other hand, nu-
merical analysis shows that ampliﬁcation of the antisymmetric mode agrees well with the weakly nonlinear theory,
whereas the magnitude of the induced symmetric mode is much larger than that. It is expected that this induced
mode together with thinning of the sheet leads to the sheet breakup downstream.

1. Introduction
Instability of a liquid sheet is of great importance not only in scientiﬁc investigations but also in
engineering and industrial applications (Lefebvre, 1989; Ramos, 1988; Chubb and White, 1987; Lin,
2003). In particular, investigations on distortion and disintegration of a falling sheet are important in

curtain ﬂow coating techniques (Alleborn, 2001). In a falling sheet, due to the gravitational force, the ﬂow
velocity increases and sheet thickness decreases as the liquid ﬂows downstream. Brown (1961) did an
experiment on a sheet falling along two parallel guide wires. He found that the ﬂow velocity agrees well
with the quasi one-dimensional theory when the surface tension is ignored. He expected in his experiment
that there exists a minimum ﬂow rate below which the sheet ﬂow is discontinuous.
In a planar sheet with both surfaces free, there exist two different modes of surface deformation known
as the symmetric (bulge or dilational) and antisymmetric (sinuous)modes. Displacements of both surfaces
are out of phase in the former and in phase in the latter (Squire, 1953). Propagations of these modes in
the falling liquid sheet have been investigated through linear unsteady analysis and/or nonlinear steady
analysis. Lin (1981) examined the local instability of inﬁnitesimal disturbances on a falling viscous
liquid sheet when the gravitational effect is sufﬁciently small. He showed that the antisymmetric mode
propagating upstream is ampliﬁed when Wb< 1, where Wb is the Weber number deﬁned as the ratio of
inertia to surface tension. Although this upstream instability occurs not temporally but spatially due to
the liquid viscosity, the antisymmetric mode for Wb> 1 and the symmetric mode for all Wb are both
spatially and temporally stable. He also discussed this ampliﬁcation in connection with the minimum
ﬂow rate suggested by Brown (1961).
The growing mode shown by Lin (1981) was later examined more precisely to consider the effects of
surrounding ﬂuids and variation of the ﬂow velocity and thickness due to gravity (Lin et al., 1990; de
Luca and Costa, 1997). The results are not essentially different from those of Lin, though the antisym-
metric mode forWb< 1 is shown to be absolutely (exactly, pseudo-absolutely) unstable. The behavior of
inﬁnitesimal disturbances in an inviscid and falling ﬂow has been examined when a pressure difference
exists between surrounding ﬂuids on the two surfaces (Weinstein et al., 1997; Clarke et al., 1997), while
numerical analysis of a viscous steady ﬂow was performed for various boundary conditions and ﬂow
parameters when the surface tension is ignored (Kistler and Scriven, 1984; Ramos, 1996).
In the above analyses, it has been assumed that disturbances on the sheet are sufﬁciently small or linear,
even if nonlinearity is considered in the steady main ﬂow. It is evident that such analyses are not sufﬁcient
to deal with large deformation and distortion of the sheet. Furthermore, the growing antisymmetric mode
shown by Lin (1981) disappears since the inﬂuence of the viscosity vanishes as the sheet thickness
becomes sufﬁciently thin. In this paper, we show that particular disturbances on the falling sheet can be
ampliﬁed by nonuniformity in the sense that the ﬂow velocity increases and sheet thickness decreases
downstream, even if the liquid viscosity and surrounding ﬂuids are ignored. The purpose of this paper
is to clarify the mechanism of the sheet breakup resulting from this ampliﬁcation under the combined
effects of nonlinearity and nonuniformity.
It is not easy to analytically examine large deformation of the liquid sheet because of the nonlinearity and
free boundaries. However, if the sheet thickness is so thin that internal structure is not signiﬁcant, the sheet
can be effectively described by the ‘membrane approximation’. In this approximation, sufﬁciently long
waves are considered compared with the sheet thickness and dependent variables such as velocities and
pressure are evaluated at the sheet mid-plane. By this approximation, the original full nonlinear equations
can be reduced to rather simple evolution equations of the sheet surfaces and velocities. Recently, Lee and
Wang (1986) obtained the unsteady nonlinear equations for a sufﬁciently thin annular liquid sheet through
conservations of mass and momentum of a ring element. Later, Mehring and Sirignano (1999) derived
equations for the ﬁnite thickness of a planar sheet by formal expansion of dependent variables in terms
of sheet thickness. Yoshinaga and Kotani (2001) derived the same equations from precise consideration
of the momentum conservation of a sheet element.

Fig. 1. Schematic of a falling liquid sheet.
In this paper, based on the nonlinear sheet equations including gravitational effects under themembrane
approximation, we analytically and numerically investigate the nonlinear behavior of a falling sheet when
the liquid viscosity and inertia of the surrounding ﬂuids are ignored. Though a uniform planar sheet
without surrounding ﬂuids is known to be stable for inﬁnitesimal disturbances, Matsuuchi (1974) showed
by the weakly nonlinear velocity potential theory that modulational waves on the sheet become unstable.
However, the inﬂuence of nonuniformity on modulational waves has not been examined in a falling sheet.
Therefore, we ﬁrst examine the propagation of modulational waves by weakly nonlinear theory, where
the multiple-scale is introduced in such a way that the effects of gravity and modulation are given on
long and slow scales, while carrier waves are given on short and fast scales. Based on the results of this
analysis, we proceed to a numerical analysis in which sufﬁcient nonlinearity is considered to examine
the breakup process.
The organization of this paper is as follows: in the next section, we show the nonlinear sheet equations
in a gravitational ﬁeld and examine steady solutions of the main ﬂow. In Section 3, we do a weakly
nonlinear analysis for modulational waves superposed on the main ﬂow and, in Section 4 we numerically
examine the nonlinear sheet equations. Finally, our conclusions are presented in Section 5.
2. Basic equations and steady solutions
2.1. Membrane equations
We show in Fig. 1 the schematic diagram of a falling liquid sheet in the (x, y) coordinate system,
where we adopt the x coordinate in the direction of the gravity acceleration g. The sheet mid-plane (x, t)
and the half sheet thickness a(x, t) are prescribed by  = (h+ + h−)/2 and a = (h+ − h−)/2 in terms
of the sheet surfaces y = h±(x, t) (h+ >h−), while the velocity components (u, v) and the pressure
p are given in the sheet (h−yh+). In the analysis, we assume that the sheet is semi-inﬁnitely long
and the liquid is inviscid with density  and surface tension , while the inertia of the surrounding ﬂuid
is ignored.
316 T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338
The continuum and momentum equations are given for h− <y <h+ as follows:
ux + vy = 0, (1)
(ut + uux + vuy) = −px + g, (2)
(vt + uvx + vvy) = −py , (3)
where the subscripts x, y and t denote differentiation. On the other hand, the boundary conditions are
prescribed on the surfaces y = h± by the following kinematical and dynamical conditions:
v = h±t + uh±x , (4)
p± = ∓h±xx(1 + h2±x)−3/2, (5)
where p± denotes the pressures on the surfaces.
According to the membrane approximation (Mehring and Sirignano, 1999; Yoshinaga and Kotani,
2001), the dependent variables u, v and p are approximately given as functions of x and t on the sheet
mid-plane y = (x, t). Then, the following membrane equations are obtained in non-dimensional form
(see Appendix A):

In the above representations, all the variables are normalized by the half-thickness A0, the ﬂow velocity
U0, the time A0/U0 and the pressure /A0 which are speciﬁed at the reference point x =0 (see Fig. 1). In
addition, non-dimensional parameters such as the Weber numberWb=U20 A0/ and the Froude number
Fr = U0/√2A0g are introduced.
In Eqs. (8) and (9), P and P are, respectively, the averaged pressure and the pressure difference given
as
P = P+ + P−

, P = (P+ − P−), (10)
by using the following normalized surface pressures from (5):
P± = ∓(xx ± axx)[1 + (x ± ax)2]−3/2.
Thus, our problem is to solve the reduced nonlinear equations (6)–(9) under appropriate initial and
boundary conditions. We ﬁrst examine the steady solutions of these equations.
2.2. Steady solutions
Since the sheet surfaces are assumed to be symmetric with respect to y = 0 for steady state in a semi-
inﬁnitely long sheet, we only consider the symmetric mode for which =0. Setting u= u¯(x) and a= a¯(x),
we have v = 0 from Eq. (7) and
P¯ = P¯+ + P¯−
2
= −a¯xx(1 + a¯2x)−3/2, P¯ = P¯+ − P¯− = 0, (11)
T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338 317
since P¯± = −a¯xx(1 + a¯2x)−3/2 in (10), while Eq. (9) is found to be automatically satisﬁed. Integrating
Eq. (6) once with respect to x, we have
a¯u¯ = 1, (12)
where a¯ = u¯ = 1 are used at x = 0. With the help of (12), we have from Eq. (8)
1
a¯3
a¯x + 1Wb [a¯xx(1 + a¯

x)
−3/2]x + 12Fr2 = 0. (13)
As a result, Eqs. (12) and (13) are found to have steady state solutions for appropriate boundary values,
when both a¯ and u¯ are assumed to be smooth functions of x.
We ﬁrst consider the approximate solutions. Assuming sufﬁciently large Wb and neglecting the term
including Wb in Eq. (13), we can easily obtain the following approximate solutions:
a¯ = u¯−1 =
(
x
Fr2
+ 1
)−1/2
, (14)
where u¯ = a¯ = 1 are again used at x = 0.
On the other hand, assuming sufﬁciently large Fr to neglect the term a¯2x , Eq. (13) is given as
1
a¯3
a¯x + 1Wb a¯xxx +

Integrating Eq. (15) with respect to x, we obtain
a¯−2 = 2
Wb
a¯xx + xFr2 + C, (16)
where C denotes the integral constant. In order to seek the approximate solutions of Eqs. (12) and (16),
we introduce the following expansions of u¯, a¯ and C in terms of a small parameter  whose magnitude is
of order Fr−2:
u¯ = u¯0 + 2u¯2 + · · · , a¯ = a¯0 + 2a¯2 + · · · , C = C0 + 2C2 + · · · . (17)
Substituting (17) into (12) and (16), we obtain the following solutions in the lowest order of the approx-
imation:
a¯0 = u¯−10 =
(

Fr20

)−1/2
, (18)
where Fr20 = Fr2 and  = x are introduced and u¯0 = 1 has been used at  = 0 to determine C0. In the
next order of the approximation to O(2), we have
a¯2 = −u¯2

Next, we numerically solve Eqs. (12) and (13) for appropriate boundary values of a¯, a¯x and a¯xx at x = 0.
Numerical calculations are done by the Runge–Kutta method using the spatial difference x = 0.001 for
0x80 000. Fig. 2 shows typical examples of sheet proﬁles whenWb= 10 and Fr= 1. In Fig. 2(a), the
boundary values a¯x(0) = −0.5 and a¯xx(0) = 0.75 are used from (14) for a¯(0) = 1. It is found that there
appear frequent oscillations on the surface whose amplitude and wave length decrease as x increases.
Although such oscillations are analytically described by Bessel functions when
√
WbFr2 ∼ O(1) and
Wb?1 (Inoue, 1975), we can show that these oscillations are annihilated for particular boundary values.
Fig. 2(b) shows that the oscillations on the surface disappear, if we adopt a(0) = 1, ax(0) = −0.447811
and axx(0)=0.5322394. Wavy proﬁles as in Fig. 2(a) may suggest upward energy wave propagation from
a generating point downstream. However, we note that this is not only unphysical for a semi-inﬁnitely
long sheet whose ﬂow velocity becomes inﬁnitely large at the lower end, but also unstable as will be
shown in later numerical calculations.
Although Fig. 2 shows that the particular boundary values prohibit surface oscillations, these values
cannot be analytically determined in advance except for Wb = ∞. However, these can be numerically
determined once Fr andWb are given. This is shown in Fig. 3, where the boundary values a¯x(0) are shown
in Fig. 3(a) and a¯xx(0) in Fig. 3(b) as functions ofFrwhen a¯(0)=1. In the ﬁgures, the boundary values for
Wb=1, 10 and 100 are compared with (14) forWb=∞. It is found in both ﬁgures that the curves of a¯x(0)
and a¯xx(0) depart from those for Wb = ∞ as Wb decreases in a region of smaller Fr. On the other hand,
Fig. 4 shows these numerical boundary values compared with the approximation (20), where a¯x(0) is
shown in Fig. 4(a) and a¯xx(0) in Fig. 4(b) whenWb=1, 10, 100 and ∞.It is found from these ﬁgures that
the discrepancy between numerical and approximate results becomes large as Fr decreases, the tendency

becoming more enhanced as Wb becomes smaller. From these results, with respect to boundary values
which lead to non-oscillating surface proﬁles, we estimate that the approximation (20) including (14) for
Wb = ∞ is valid when WbFr4 is, at least, larger than 100.
However, we note that the surface proﬁles without oscillations are similar to each other for differentWb
as long as Fr is ﬁxed. In fact, as is shown in Fig. 5 where numerical surface proﬁles for Wb = 1, 10, 100
are compared with the approximation (14) for Wb = ∞ when Fr = 1, we hardly ﬁnd any discrepancy in
the surface proﬁles except for a slight difference in a region of small x when Wb = 1. From this ﬁgure,
we can say that the surface proﬁles are not sensitive to the values of Wb and, therefore, approximation
(14) with simpler algebraic representation is found to be sufﬁcient to describe the surfaces. In the next
theoretical analysis, approximation (14) is adopted as the steady solution, on which wave propagations
are considered over a long time and distance.

3. Modulational instability
3.1. Multiple scales
In the weakly nonlinear theory, we examine modulational wave propagations on a spatially nonuniform
sheet in which ﬂuid velocity increases and thickness decreases downstream. For this end, we divide the
variables a, , u, v, P , and P into the following steady and unsteady parts:
a = a¯(x) + a˜(x, t),  = ˜(x, t), u = u¯(x) + u˜(x, t), v = v˜(x, t), (22)
P = P¯ (x) + P˜ (x, t), P = P˜ (x, t). (23)
Noting that a¯, u¯ and P¯ for the steady state are given by (11), (12) and (13), and substituting the above
representations into Eqs. (6)–(9), we have the following equations with respect to the unsteady parts:
a˜t + (a¯u˜ + u¯a˜ + a˜u˜)x = 0, (24)
˜t + (u¯ + u˜)˜x − v˜ = 0, (25)

= 0, (26)
(a¯ + a˜)v˜t + (a¯ + a˜)(u¯ + u˜)v˜x + P˜2Wb = 0. (27)
Since we consider modulational waves which consist of slowly varying amplitude and rapidly oscillating
carrier phase, it is convenient to introduce the following multiple scales of x and t:
xj = j x, tj = j t (j = 0, 1, 2, . . .), (28)
where  is a small parameter. In the above representations, we note that the variables tj and xj mean slower
or longer scales for larger j. For weak gravitational effect of large Fr, we assume that nonuniformity
T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338 321
appears only on the x2 scale. Since we adopt (14) as the steady solutions of a¯ and u¯, they are written as
a¯(x2) = u¯(x2)−1 =
(
x2
Fr20
+ 1
)−1/2
, (29)
where we set Fr0 = Fr for large Fr, which means that the magnitude of  is taken to be of order Fr−1.
On the other hand, assuming weak nonlinearity, the unsteady variables a˜, ˜, u˜, v˜, P˜ and P˜ are
expanded in terms of  as follows:
a˜ = a1 + 2a2 + 3a3 + · · · , (30)
˜ = 1 + 22 + 33 + · · · , (31)
u˜ = u1 + 2u2 + 3u3 + · · · , (32)
v˜ = v1 + 2v2 + 3v3 + · · · , (33)
P˜ = P1 + 2P2 + 3P3 + · · · , (34)
P˜ = P1 + 2P2 + 3P3 + · · · , (35)
where the coefﬁcients aj , j , uj , vj , Pj and Pj (j = 1, 2, 3, . . .) of each power of  are functions of
x0, x1, x2, . . . and t0, t1, t2, . . . . Since P˜ and P˜ can be written in terms of the other variables such as a˜
and ˜ by using (10), we assume the following starting solutions for a1, 1, u1, v1:⎛
⎜⎝
a1
1
u1
v1
⎞
⎟⎠=
⎛
⎜⎝
A1
E1
U1
V1
⎞
⎟⎠ exp(i) + C.C., (36)
where C.C. denotes complex conjugate and  is the rapidly oscillating phase
 = k(x2)x0 − t0, (37)
while A1, E1, U1 and V1 are slowly varying functions of xj and tj for j = 1, 2, . . . . Although both k and
 may be functions of the slow variable x2 because the nonuniformity appears in a¯(x2) and u¯(x2), we
ﬁnd below that only k is a function of x2;  is constant. By using (28), /x0 =k/ and /t0 =−/
in (37), we introduce the following derivative expansion (Jeffrey and Kawahara, 1982):
/x = k/ + /x1 + 2/x2 + · · · , (38)
/t = −/ + /t1 + 2/t2 + · · · . (39)
We have the relation /x2 + k/t2 = 0 from the invariance 2/xt ≡ 2/tx in (38) and (39). Since
k and  are independent of t2,  is found to be independent of x2 from the above relation and, therefore,
constant. Thus, making use of (30)–(35) together with (38) and (39) into (24)–(27), we obtain successive
equations in powers of .
3.2. Inﬁnitesimal waves propagating on the main ﬂow
We begin with the lowest order of approximation to O(). For the steady part of the averaged pressure
P, we have from (11) and (23)
P¯ = −4a¯x2x2 + O(8), (40)
322 T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338
while for the unsteady parts of P and the pressure difference P , we have from (10), (34) and (35)
P1 = −k2a1, P1 = −2k21, (41)
where the subscripts xj , tj (j = 1, 2, . . .) and  indicate differentiations. On the other hand, the term
including Wb in (13) is of order 6, so that the approximation (14) for Wb = ∞ is valid up to O(5).
Since the signiﬁcant amplitude equations are obtained to O(3) as will be seen later, the use of (14) in
the analysis is valid within the present approximation.
Then, the following equations are obtained from (24) to (27):
(ku¯ − )1 − v1 = 0, (42)
(k − a¯)v1 + P12Wb = 0, (43)
(ku¯ − )a1 + ka¯u1 = 0, (44)
(k − a¯)u1 + ka¯WbP1 = 0. (45)
Substituting (36) into the above equations and using the condition thatA1,E1,U1,V1 should be non-trivial,
we obtain the following linear dispersion relations between k and :
(ku¯ − )2 = k4a¯/Wb and E1 = V1 = 0, (46)
or
(ku¯ − )2 = k2/(a¯Wb) and A1 = U1 = 0, (47)
where u¯, a¯ and k are regarded as locally constant on the x0 and t0 scales. In the above relations, (46)
denotes the symmetric mode in which the sheet mid-plane is quiescent (1 = 0), while (47) denotes the
antisymmetric mode in which the sheet thickness is constant (a1 =0). The symmetric mode is dispersive,
whereas the antisymmetric mode is non-dispersive within the present membrane approximation.
Now we examine the wave propagations on the main ﬂow which is spatially nonuniform. We assume
this nonuniformity to be so weak that the inﬂuence on wave propagation appears only through the local
ﬂow velocity u¯ and thickness a¯. Since we examine the wave propagations on such a spatially nonuniform
sheet, it is convenient to consider that the wave number k is a function of u¯, a¯ and  in the dispersion
relations (46) and (47). Starting with the symmetric mode, it is found from Eq. (46) that the following
two signiﬁcant wave numbers k± exist for positive :
k± = ±12
√
Wb
a¯
⎛
⎝u¯ −
√
u¯2 ∓ 4
√
a¯
Wb
⎞
⎠ , (48)
where we have discarded the cases when k = 0 for  = 0. It is easily found from (48) that the k− mode
is neutrally stable because k− is always real and positive. On the other hand, the k+ mode is real and
positive when u¯24
√
a¯/Wb, but the mode is complex when u¯2 < 4
√
a¯/Wb. The group velocity vg
is deﬁned as d/dk for k = kR which is the real part of complex k. It is then shown in k = k+ mode
that vg+ =
√
u¯2 − 4√a¯/Wb when u¯24√a¯/Wb and vg+ = 0 when u¯2 < 4√a¯/Wb, while ink = k−
mode vg− =
√
u¯2 + 4√a¯/Wb for any u¯. Although the complex k+ mode seems to be unstable, since
vg+ vanishes for u¯2 < 4
√
a¯/Wb, we ﬁnd that the mode for that case does not propagate. As a result, the
T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338 323
symmetric mode in k± is always neutrally stable and propagates downstream for any values of u¯, that is,
for all Wb.
Next we consider the antisymmetric mode, for which the dispersion relation (47) is rewritten as
k± = 
u¯(1 ∓ 1/√u¯Wb) , (49)
where we have used u¯a¯ = 1. In the above representation, it is found that k± are always real and so the
waves are neutrally stable. Since the group velocities of the k± modes are given as
vg± = u¯
(
1 ∓ 1√
u¯Wb
)
, (50)
vg+ is negative and vg− is positive when u¯Wb< 1, while both vg± are positive when u¯Wb> 1.
Introducing the local Weber number Wb deﬁned as Wb = u¯Wb, the antisymmetric mode propagates
both upstream and downstream forWb < 1 and propagates downstream forWb > 1, while the symmetric
mode always propagates downstream for allWb. Although all the present modes are found to be neutrally
stable, we note that the sheet becomes pseudo-absolutely or convectively unstable (Lin, 2003) if the inertia
of the surrounding ﬂuids is considered without making any membrane approximation.
3.3. Amplitude equations
Let us proceed to the next order of the approximation. We ﬁrst consider the symmetric mode for which
the dispersion relation (46) is satisﬁed in the lowest order of the approximation. We assume the following
second order of the solution:⎛
⎜⎝
a2
2
u2
v2
⎞
⎟⎠=
⎛
⎜⎝
A22
E22
U22

⎞
⎟⎠ exp(2i) + C.C. +
⎛
⎜⎝
A20
E20
U20
V20
⎞
⎟⎠ , (51)
where A22 to V22 are slowly varying complex functions of xj and tj (j = 1, 2, . . .), while A20 to V20
are slowly varying real functions of xj and tj (j = 1, 2, . . .). Making use of (36) and (51) together with
E1 =V1 =0, we obtain in O(2) the following equation from the non-secular condition in the coefﬁcients
of exp(i) (see Appendix B.1):
A1t1 + vgA1x1 = 0, (52)
where vg=/k for k=k±. This equation means thatA1 does not change its form in a frame of reference
moving with vg . We also obtain the following relation from the coefﬁcients of exp(2i):
A22 = −12 u¯A
2
1, U22 =
3(ku¯ − )u¯
2ka¯
A21, (53)
E22 = V22 = 0. (54)
We ﬁnd in (53) that the second harmonics of the fundamental mode in a1 and u1 appear in a2 and u2,
whereas from (54) such second harmonics are not induced in 2 and v2. This means that the antisymmetric
mode is not excited by the symmetric mode disturbances.
324 T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338
In O(3) we can ﬁnally obtain the following nonlinear amplitude equation from the non-secular
condition:
i(A1t2 + vgA1x2) + RA1x1x1 = QA1|A1|2 + iTA1 + 	A1, (55)
where
R = −ku¯ − 

, T = (ku¯ − 2)
2 + 5k2u¯2
16Fr20ku¯2(ku¯ − 2)
, (56)
	 = kU20 − (ku¯ − )u¯A202 . (57)
In the above, we note that U20 and A20 are to be determined to O(4). However, we do not proceed to the
next higher order approximation to seek U20 and A20 because the term with 	 in Eq. (55) can be included
as a phase shift into A1 by setting
A1 = aˆ exp
(
−i
∫
	
vg
dx2
)
. (58)
Thus, Eqs. (55) and (52) are the amplitude equations of the modulational waves. In the original x − t
coordinate system, these equations are rewritten in the following combined form by using (58):
i(aˆt + vgaˆx) + Raˆxx = Qaˆ|aˆ|2 + iTˆ aˆ, (59)
where
Tˆ = (ku¯ − 2)
2 + 5k2u¯2
16Fr2ku¯2(ku¯ − 2) , (60)
and R and Q are as given in (56).
Without the terms R and Q in Eq. (59), it is easily found that the amplitude aˆ grows for positive Tˆ
and decays for negative Tˆ , where the sign of Tˆ is determined from that of (ku¯ − 2). We can show that
(ku¯−2)=−k√u¯2 − 4√a¯/Wb< 0 for k=k+ from (46) and (48),while (ku¯−2)=−k2√a¯/Wb−< 0
for k=k− from (46). Therefore, Tˆ is always negative and so the amplitude of the symmetric mode decays
due to the gravitational effect. On the other hand, Eq. (59) without the term Tˆ is the well-known Nonlinear
Schrödinger (NLS) equation. Since RQ< 0 from (56), a plane wave solution is modulationally unstable
and then the envelope soliton solution of sech-type can exist. Although the soliton solution has been
shown to exist on a uniform sheet (Matsuuchi, 1974), the solution decays on the present falling sheet
because Tˆ < 0.
Next we consider the antisymmetric mode for which (47) is satisﬁed in the lowest order of the approx-
imation. Noting that A1 = U1 = 0, we obtain the following equations from the non-secular condition in
a similar way to the symmetric mode (see Appendix B.2):
E1t1 + vgE1x1 = 0. (61)
In addition, we have from the coefﬁcients of exp(2i)
A22 = − k

T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338 325
It is found in the above relations that the second harmonics of the fundamental mode in 1 appear in a2 and
u2, which means that the symmetric mode is excited from the antisymmetric mode due to the nonlinear
interaction. We note that this excitation is in contrast with the previous case in which the antisymmetric
mode is not excited from the symmetricmode.We also note that there appears a singularity at k=±1/(2a¯)
in (62), which is also found in the representation of Q in (64). This singularity for k = ±1/(2a¯) results
from the second harmonic resonance (2k, 2) of the antisymmetric disturbance. That is, since (46) for
the symmetric mode can be written as 2ku¯ − 2 = ±4k2√a¯/Wb = ±2k(1/a¯)
√ ¯a/Wb if k = ±1/(2a¯),
we can ﬁnd that this relation is nothing but (47) for the second harmonic (2k, 2) of the antisymmetric
mode.
To O(3) we have the following amplitude equation from the non-secular condition:
i(E1t2 + vgE1x2) = QE1|E1|2 + iT E1 + 	E1, (63)
where
Q = k

A20, (64)
while A20 in 	 is to be determined to O(4) and U20 = −(ku¯ − )A20/ka¯ is given through A20. Since 	
can be included in E1 by setting
E1 = ˆ exp
(
−i
∫
	
vg
dx2
)
, (65)
we do not proceed to the next higher order approximation to seek A20. Combining Eqs. (61) and (63) and
using (65), we ﬁnally obtain the following amplitude equation in the original x − t coordinate system:
i(ˆt + vg ˆx) = Qˆ|ˆ|2 + iTˆ ˆ, (66)
where
Tˆ = 
4ku¯
du¯
dx
, (67)
and Q is given by (64). Because our system is non-dispersive for the antisymmetric mode, the dispersion
term E1x1x1 disappears in Eq. (63). Therefore, the equation is not of NLS type and does not have any
solitary wave solutions even if Tˆ = 0. However, we can obtain a progressive wave solution. Introducing
the transformations  = x − vgt and 
 = t , Eq. (66) is rewritten as
iˆ
 = Qˆ|ˆ|2 + iTˆ ˆ. (68)
Setting ˆ = |ˆ| exp(i) and noting that |ˆ| and  are real, we have the following solution from the real
and imaginary parts of (68):
|ˆ| = |ˆ0| exp(Tˆ 
), 2 = −(Q/Tˆ )|ˆ0|2 exp(2Tˆ 
) + 20, (69)
where |ˆ0| and0 denote initial values at 
= 0. Since |ˆ| grows or decays in a frame of reference moving
with vg , we need to examine the sign of Tˆ in (67). Noting that , u¯ and du¯/dx are positive and vg =/k
from (50), the signs of Tˆ and vg depend upon the sign of k. Then, it is found that either Tˆ > 0 and vg > 0
326 T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338
for k > 0 or Tˆ < 0 and vg < 0 for k < 0. Resulting from this, the disturbance propagates upstream (vg < 0)
and decays for k=k+ mode whenWb < 1, while it propagates downstream (vg > 0) and grows for k=k±
modes when Wb > 1 or for k = k− mode when Wb < 1.
4. Numerical results
In the numerical analysis, we ﬁrst examine the instability of the steady solutions obtained in Section 2,
in which the solutions become non-oscillatory for the particular boundary values. Next we examine the
initial value and initial-boundary value problems for the modulational waves in order to see how the
waves grow or decay. Numerical calculations are carried out by using the ﬁnite difference method for
the temporal and spatial derivatives in Eqs. (6)–(9), when the spatial domain is taken to be 0x400.
In most of the calculations, the temporal and spatial differences are, respectively, taken as 0.00025 and
0.025.
4.1. Instability of the steady solutions
In order to see the instability of the steady solutions, we numerically solve the unsteady equa-
tions (6)–(9) when the steady solutions in Section 2 are taken as the initial conditions. In Fig. 6, we show
the temporal evolution of the initial sheet proﬁle obtained in Eqs. (12) and (13) for a¯x(0) = a¯xx(0) = 0
and a¯(0)= 1 whenWb= 10 and Fr=√10. It is found that the oscillatory behavior of the initial proﬁle in
Fig. 6(a) decays downstream as in Fig. 6(b), and ﬁnally seems to disappear on the whole sheet surface in

Fig. 6(c). In order to see this in more detail, Fig. 7 shows the comparison of the sheet proﬁle of Fig. 6(c)
with the steady solution in Eqs. (12) and (13) for the boundary values a(0) = 1, ax(0) = −0.049821 and
axx(0) = 0.007387. From this comparison, little discrepancy can be seen between the two sheet proﬁles,
so that we can expect that the oscillatory surface proﬁle ﬁnally becomes close to the non-oscillatory
proﬁle. In fact, it is conﬁrmed that the sheet remains without changing its proﬁle for a sufﬁciently long
time when the non-oscillatory steady solution is used as the initial condition. Therefore, the oscillatory
steady solution is unstable in the sense that the oscillatory property cannot be maintained, so that only
the non-oscillatory sheet proﬁle can survive in the steady state of the semi-inﬁnitely long sheet.
4.2. Symmetric mode
Now we consider the evolution of the modulational waves in both initial value and initial-boundary
value problems. We ﬁrst examine the symmetric mode. The initial values of a, u,  and v are then set as
follows:
a(x, 0) = a¯(x) + a˜(x, 0), (x, 0) = 0, u(x, 0) = u¯(x) + u˜(x, 0), v(x, 0) = 0. (70)
In Eq. (70), a¯ and u¯ are the non-oscillatory steady solutions numerically given by Eqs. (12) and (13),
while the following modulational wave packets are considered for a˜ and u˜:
a˜(x, 0) =  sech[k′(x − x0)] cos[k(x − x0)], (71)
u˜ = −(ku¯ − )a˜/(ka¯), (72)
where (44) is used to obtain (72) since u1 and a1 ∝ exp(i). In the above representations, x0 gives
the location of the maximum amplitude of the packet and we assume |k′|>|k| which means a long
modulational wave, while the wave number k = k± is a function of x through u¯ and a¯ in (48) once  and
Wb are given.
Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the sheet surfaces h± (solid lines) and the sheet mid-plane  (broken
lines) when k = k+ mode forWb= 10 and Fr=
√
10, where the initial values of the disturbance are given
for =2.25, x0 =50,=0.2 and k′ =0.2, while we set k+ =1 at x =x0. It is found from this ﬁgure that
the disturbance propagates downstream, varying its amplitude and wavelength, though the symmetric
property of the sheet is still preserved since  = 0 for all time. In order to see such a development of the
wave proﬁle in more detail, we show in Fig. 9 the evolution of a˜ which deviates from the steady sheet
thickness (a− a¯). In this ﬁgure, we ﬁnd that the amplitude decreases and the wave length increases as the
disturbance propagates downstream. It is found that this decay of the amplitude agrees with the theoretical
prediction of Tˆ < 0 in (60), while the increase of the wave length is easily seen from k ∼ /u¯ for small

and (c) t = 50.
 in (48) because u¯ increases downstream and  is always constant. We note that similar behavior to the
above k+ mode can be seen when k = k− mode.
On the other hand, in order to compare the sheet proﬁles between the numerical and theoretical results,
we show in Fig. 10 the thickness deviation a˜ at t = 50, where the broken line denotes the numerical a˜ in
Fig. 9(c),while the solid line represents the envelope of a˜ which is obtained by theweakly nonlinear theory.
Since a˜=2|aˆ| cos(+) from a˜=aˆ exp(i)+C.C. and aˆ=|aˆ| exp(i), the envelope is described by±2|aˆ|
which is calculated from the amplitude equation (59) for the initial condition aˆ = (/2)sech[k′(x − x0)].
In this ﬁgure, we ﬁnd that both results agree well with respect to the maximum amplitude except for slight
difference in the envelope proﬁles and peak amplitude locations. This shows that larger nonlinearity does
not always more affect the ampliﬁcation or decay of the envelope, which may be reasonable from the fact
that Tˆ in(59) appears in the linear term.
As a slightly more experimentally feasible example, with the disturbance being given at a boundary
such as a slit nozzle exit, we examine the initial-boundary value problem for which thickness ﬂuctuation
is only given as a disturbance at x = 0 and t0. The boundary conditions are then set as follows:
a(0, t) = a¯(0) + a˜(0, t), (0, t) = 0, u(0, t) = u¯(0), v(0, t) = 0, (73)
where u¯(0) = a¯(0) = 1 and
a˜(0, t) =  sech[′(t − t0)] cos[(t − t0)]. (74)

In the calculations, the non-oscillatory steady solutions u¯(x) and a¯(x) are numerically given, while
 = 0.8,  = 1, ′ = 0.25 and t0 = 20 are used. In Fig. 11, the evolution of the sheet proﬁles is
numerically shown for Wb = 100 and Fr = √10. It is found in the ﬁgure that the amplitude of the
disturbance decreases downstream. In addition, we ﬁnd that the initial wave packet becomes broadened
and seemingly disintegrated, splitting into two parts as it propagates downstream. This is because the
initial disturbance at x=0 contains two different modes k± with different propagating velocities, which is
in contrast to the single mode propagation in Fig. 8. Resulting from this, we can say that symmetric mode
disturbances decrease, disappearing downstream in both initial and initial-boundary value problems.

4.3. Antisymmetric mode
Let us consider the antisymmetric mode. For the initial value problem, the conditions are taken as
a(x, 0) = a¯(x), (x, 0) = ˜(x, 0), u(x, 0) = u¯(x), v(x, 0) = v˜(x, 0). (75)
In Eq. (75), a¯ and u¯ are numerically given, while ˜ and v˜ are taken as the following modulational wave
packets:
˜(x, 0) =  sech[k′(x − x0)] cos[k(x − x0)], (76)
v˜(x, 0) = −(ku¯ − ) sech[k′(x − x0)] sin[k(x − x0)], (77)
where |k′|>|k| for the long modulational wave and k = k± are given by (49), while v˜ is obtained by (42)
since 1 and v1 ∝ exp(i).
Setting the parameters to be  = 1.96, x0 = 50,  = 0.2, k′ = 0.2 and k+ = 1 at x = x0, we show the
numerical results for the k+ mode in Fig. 12. In this ﬁgure, the sheet surfaces h± (solid lines) and the
sheet mid-plane  (broken lines) are shown forWb=10 and Fr=√10. It is found from the ﬁgure that the
disturbance on the sheet propagates downstream without decaying as time increases. In order to see this
more precisely, we show in Fig. 13 the displacement of the sheet mid-plane ˜, while Fig. 14 shows the
deviation of the sheet thickness a˜. We can see from Fig. 13 that the maximum amplitude and wave length
of ˜ increase as the disturbance propagates downstream, where broken lines are drawn in order to see
how the initial amplitude increases. We note that this ampliﬁcation appears only for the antisymmetric
mode propagating downstream, which is predicted by Tˆ > 0 from (67) when k = k+ > 0 and du¯/dx > 0.
We also note that the wavelength increases as in the symmetric mode, since k± decreases downstream
for constant  as is seen from (49).
On the other hand, the weakly nonlinear theory shows in (62) that the antisymmetric mode induces
the symmetric mode in the form of the second harmonic. This induced mode can also be found in the
numerical results. Fig. 14 shows the development of the induced mode in the deviation thickness a˜.

Fig. 12. Time evolution of the sheet proﬁles of the antisymmetric mode when Wb = 10 and Fr = √10 and k = k+, where the
initial values are given as = 1.96, x0 = 50, k′ = 0.2 and = 0.2, while k+ = 1 at x = x0; (a) t = 0, (b) t = 25 and (c) t = 50.
Although it is hard to see a symmetric mode at t = 0 in Fig. 14(a), we can see that the mode is largely
induced at t = 25 in Fig. 14(b) and slightly saturated after a long time at t = 50 in Fig. 14(c). In Figs.
14(b) and (c), we ﬁnd that the induced mode is a modulational wave whose carrier phase has the half
wave length of ˜, that is, the second harmonic. In addition, the induced modulational wave is followed
by a long wave whose wave length is of the modulation.
In Fig. 15 we compare the numerical results shown in Figs. 13 and 14 with the weakly nonlinear theory.
Both theoretical envelope (solid lines) and numerical wave (broken lines) are shown in Fig. 15(a) for ˜
and in (b) for a˜ when t = 50. Since ˜ = 2|ˆ| cos( + ) from ˜ = ˆ exp(i) + C.C. and ˆ = |ˆ| exp(i),
the theoretical envelope of ˜ is described by ±2|ˆ| which is obtained by solving the amplitude equation
(66) or the exact solution (69) for the initial condition ˆ = (/2) sech[k′(x − x0)].In the same way, the
theoretical envelope of a˜ is described by ±2|aˆ| which is calculated by (62) and the magnitude of aˆ can be
determined only through ˆ. As is seen from Fig. 15, both numerical and theoretical results with respect to
˜ are in good agreement with each other, while the numerical result for a˜ is much larger than in the weakly
nonlinear theory, in spite of such good agreement for ˜. Within the order of the present approximation,
weakly nonlinear theory can explain neither the magnitude of the induced a˜ nor the appearance of a long
negative wave behind the induced modulated wave. But we can at least say that nonlinearity strongly
affects the excitation of the symmetric mode by the antisymmetric one; and, due to the nonuniformity of
the sheet, its effect is less upon the growth of the antisymmetric mode itself.

Next we consider the case when the disturbance propagate upstream, where vg+ < 0 from (50) for the
k+ mode whenWb < 1. The propagation of this mode is shown in Fig. 16 forWb=0.1 and Fr=

10. In
the ﬁgure, the initial conditions are given in (76) and (77) when x0 = 100, = 0.2, k′ = 0.2 and = 2.5,
while Wb =
√
11Wb and k+ = −1 at x = x0. We ﬁnd from this ﬁgure that the disturbance propagates
upstream and its amplitude decreases as it propagates. This is expected from the fact that Tˆ < 0 in Eq.
(67) since k = k+ < 0 and both du¯/dx and  are positive. Even for the aboveWb, however, the k− mode
whose group velocity is positive propagates downstream while increasing its amplitude.
We ﬁnally examine the initial-boundary value problem, when the ﬂuctuation is only given on the
mid-plane at the boundary. Then, the boundary conditions at x = 0 for t0 are given as
a(0, t) = a¯(0), (0, t) = ˜(0, t), u(0, t) = u¯(0), v(0, t) = 0, (78)
where u¯(0) = a¯(0) = 1 and
˜(0, t) =  sech[′(t − t0)] cos[(t − t0)]. (79)
We show in Fig. 17 the evolution of the sheet for such initial and boundary conditions whenWb= 100
and Fr = √10, where = 0.3, = 1, ′ = 0.25 and t0 = 20 are taken at the boundary x = 0. It is found
that rather small amplitude of the ﬂuctuation at the boundary in Fig. 17(a) grows to become large in Fig.
17(b). It is also found in Fig. 17(c) that the sheet locally becomes thick like a blob and thin like a ﬁlm due
to the induced mode. Resulting from this, the sheet is expected to break up at the thinnest part, which is
enhanced by thinning downstream.

5. Conclusions
Propagation of modulational waves on a falling liquid sheet has been examined in a gravitational
ﬁeld. The analysis is based on the nonlinear equations derived under the membrane approximation
for an inviscid liquid sheet in the absence of surrounding ﬂuids. In the steady solutions of the equa-
tions, we obtain the non-oscillatory solutions for the particular boundary values corresponding to a ﬂow
whose velocity increases and thickness decreases monotonically downstream. It is found that such so-
lutions are numerically stable in the sense that the oscillatory solutions asymptotically approach the
non-oscillatory ones in the unsteady equations. This means that only the non-oscillatory solutions can
physically exist in the steady state if a semi-inﬁnitely long sheet is considered. For unsteady prob-
lems, it is found that inﬁnitesimal disturbances of the antisymmetric mode propagate both upstream
and downstream for the local Weber number Wb < 1, while the antisymmetric mode for Wb > 1 and

the symmetric mode for all Wb propagate downstream. All these modes are stable spatially as well as
temporally.
In the weakly nonlinear analysis, we have obtained the amplitude equations for both symmetric and
antisymmetric modes of the modulational waves. It is found from these equations that only the antisym-
metric mode propagating downstream is ampliﬁed due to the nonuniformity of the sheet, from which the
symmetric mode is excited due to the nonlinearity. On the other hand, numerical analysis is done for the
initial value problem in the sheet equations to compare with the weakly nonlinear theory. It is shown
numerically that the ampliﬁcation of the antisymmetric mode agrees well with the weakly nonlinear the-
ory, whereas the magnitude of the induced symmetric mode is much larger than that. This is because the
ampliﬁcation is caused linearly in the amplitude equations, whereas the excitation of the induced mode
is essentially due to the nonlinearity. In the initial-boundary value problem for the antisymmetric mode,
the numerical results particularly show that the sheet becomes locally thin due to the largely induced
symmetric mode, which is effectively enhanced by the sheet thinning downstream. Consequently, it is
expected that this induced mode will lead to disintegration of the sheet at a bottle-neck.
Our breakupmechanismof a falling sheet is essentially different from that of Lin (1981). The breakup in
our case appears downstream forWb > 1 due to the combined effects of nonuniformity with nonlinearity.
However, the breakup byLin in the linear theory appears in the upstreamof a viscous sheet forWb < 1 due
to the spatial instability of the upward propagating antisymmetric mode. Although Brown’s experiment
on sheet breakup near the slit nozzle is well explained by Lin, his experiment also shows another type of
sheet breakup in which a small hole on the sheet grows to cause disintegration if Wb > 1. Our breakup

process appearing for Wb > 1 can, at least, start such a breakup. The ﬂuid viscosity and the surrounding
which we have neglected in this paper could either suppress or enhance breakup. We can say, however,
that both nonlinearity and nonuniformity are essential in the ampliﬁcation and breakup mechanism in the
falling sheet.
Appendix A. Membrane approximation
According to the formal expansion method by Mehring and Sirignano (1999), we derive the sheet
equations in the gravitational ﬁeld. For thin sheet thickness, the following power series expansions with
respect to (y − ) are introduced:
u = u(0) + (y − )u(1) + (y − )2u(2) + · · · , (A.1)
v = v(0) + (y − )v(1) + (y − )2v(2) + · · · , (A.2)
p = p(0) + (y − )p(1) + (y − )2p(2) + · · · , (A.3)
where y =  denotes the sheet mid-plane given as = (h+ + h−)/2 in terms of the sheet surfaces y = h±
(h+ >h−). Adding both equations obtained by the substitution of (A.1) and (A.2) into (4) for y =h+ and
h−, we have
v(0) = t + u(0)x . (A.4)
336 T. Yoshinaga, K. Kan / Fluid Dynamics Research 38 (2006) 313–338
Subtracting the equation obtained by substituting both (A.1) and (A.2) into (4) for y = h+ from that for
y = h−, we have
at + u(0)ax = a(v(1) − u(1)x), (A.5)
where the sheet half thickness a = (h+ − h−)/2. With the help of (A.5), the series expansion of Eq. (1)
using (A.1) and (A.2) leads to
at + (u(0)a)x = 0. (A.6)
On the other hand, substituting (A.1)–(A.3) into Eqs. (2) and (3) with the help of (A.4) and (5), we obtain
(u(0)t + u(0)u(0)x ) = −(p(0)x − p(1)x) + g, (A.7)
(v(0)t + u(0)v(0)x ) = −p(1), (A.8)
where
p(0) = p+ + p−

, (A.9)
and p± are given from the dynamical boundary condition
p± = ∓ ( ± a)xx[1 + (x ± ax)2]3/2
. (A.10)
Thus, the problem is reduced to solving Eqs. (A.4), (A.6)–(A.8). Normalizing all the variables in these
equations by A0, U0, A0/U0 and /A0 as is described in Section 2, we have the sheet equations (6)–(9).
We note that the normalized average pressure P and pressure difference P in (10) are, respectively,
given from the normalization of p(0) and 2p(1)a in (A.9).
Appendix B. Derivation of the amplitude equations
Based on the results of (46) and (47), we derive the amplitude equations for the symmetric and anti-
symmetric modes.
B.1. Symmetric mode
Noting that 1 = v1 = 0 in (46) and making use of the expansions (30)–(35) together with (38) and
(39) in (24)–(27), we obtain the following equations to O(2):
(ku¯ − )2 − v2 = 0, (B.1)
(k − a¯)v2 + P22Wb = 0, (B.2)
(ku¯ − )a2 + ka¯u2 + a1t1 + a¯u1x1 + u¯a1x1 + k(a1u1) = 0, (B.3)

(a2 + a2) − 3(ku¯ − )2a¯ a1a1 = 0, (B.6)
where vg = d/dk = −u¯ + 2/k. Using (36) and (51), we have (52) from the coefﬁcients of exp(i)
in (B.6), while (53) from the coefﬁcients of exp(2i) in (B.6) and (B.5). In addition, we have (54) from
(B.1) and (B.2).
Proceeding to the next order of the approximation O(3), we obtain the following equations from (24)
and (26):
(ku¯ − )a3 + ka¯u3 + a2t1 + a¯u2x1 + u¯a2x1 + k(a1u2)
+ k(a2u1) + (a1u1) + a1t2 + (a1u¯)x2 + (u1a¯)x2 = 0, (B.7)

where
P3 = −k2a3 − 2k(a2x1 − 34k3a1a21 + a1x2) − kx2a1 − a1x1x1 .
Eliminating u3 in the above equations and using (36) and (51), we ﬁnally obtain the amplitude equation
(55) from the non-secular condition for the coefﬁcients of exp(i).
B.2. Antisymmetric mode
Considering a1 = u1 = 0 in (47), we obtain the following equations to O(2) from (24) to (27) in a
similar way to the symmetric mode:
(ku¯ − )2 + (1t1 − u¯1x1) − v2 = 0, (B.9)

where P1 is given in (41), while P2 = −k2a2 and P2 = −2k22 − 4k1x1 . We have (61) from (B.9)
and (B.10) through (42), while the following equation is obtained from (B.11) and (B.12):
a2 + 1
k2a¯2
a2 = u¯11. (B.13)
Using (36) and (51), we have (62) from the coefﬁcients of exp(2i) in (B.13) and (B.11).
For the next order of the approximation in O(3), we have from (25) and (27)
(ku¯ − )3 + (2t1 + u¯2x1) + (1t2 + u¯1x2) + ku21 − v3 = 0, (B.14)
(k − a¯)v3 + (a¯v2t1 + v2x1) + (a¯v1t2 + v1x2) + (ka¯u2 + ku¯a2 − a2)v1 +

P3 = 3k4121 − 2k23 − 4k(2x1 + 1x2) − 2kx21 − 21x1x1 .
Eliminating v1, v2 and v3 in (B.14) and (B.15) togetherwith (42) and (B.9), we ﬁnally obtain the amplitude
equation (63) from the non-secular condition in the coefﬁcients of exp(i).
