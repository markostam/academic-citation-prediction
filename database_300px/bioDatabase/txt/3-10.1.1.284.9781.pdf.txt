ABSTRACT
Here, we present a novel method for SNP genotyping
based on protease-mediated allele-specific primer
extension (PrASE), where the two allele-specific
extension primers only differ in their 30-positions.
As reported previously [Ahmadian,A., Gharizadeh,B.,
O’Meara,D., Odeberg,J. and Lundeberg,J. (2001),
Nucleic Acids Res., 29, e121], the kinetics of perfectly
matched primer extension is faster than mismatched
primer extension. In this study, we have utilized this
difference in kinetics by adding protease, a protein-
degradingenzyme, todiscriminatebetweentheexten-
sion reactions. The competition between the poly-
merase activity and the enzymatic degradation
yields extension of the perfectly matched primer,
while the slower extension of mismatched primer is
eliminated. To allow multiplex and simultaneous
detection of the investigated single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs), each extension primer was given
a unique signature tag sequence on its 50 end, com-
plementary to a tag on a generic array. A multiplex
nested PCR with 13 SNPs was performed in a total
of 36 individuals and their alleles were scored. To
demonstrate the improvements in scoring SNPs by
PrASE, we also genotyped the individuals without
inclusion of protease in the extension. We conclude
that the developed assay is highly allele-specific, with
excellent multiplex SNP capabilities.
INTRODUCTION
The most common type of genetic diversity in the human
genome is single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These
bi-allelic alterations are distributed across the genome and
have been implicated in genetic disorders, susceptibility to
different diseases, predisposition to adverse reactions to
drugs and use in forensic investigations. The selection of suit-
able strategies for monitoring and scoring of these SNPs
requires validated SNPs and accurate methodologies. A num-
ber of techniques are now available for rapid and automated
genotyping (1,2). The use of miniaturized assays, such as
microarrays with oligonucleotide reagents immobilized on
small surfaces is a frequently proposed approach for large-
scale mutation analysis and high-throughput genotyping of
SNPs. Despite considerable efforts, some of the microarray
techniques, however, suffer from relatively low accuracy com-
pared with conventional DNA sequencing technologies. For
example, microarray hybridization of PCR fragments to allele-
specific oligonucleotide probes relies on the thermal stability
of the PCR fragment and the short probe (3). The limitation
lies in the fact that the minute differences in the duplex sta-
bility between a perfect match and a mismatch at one base may
be difficult to distinguish. However, improvements in the tech-
nology have been made by monitoring, in real-time, the
dynamics of hybridization (4,5). Another approach to enhance
the discrimination power of microarray-based polymorphism
analysis is to employ enzymatic events on the arrays, such as
ligation assays (6,7), minisequencing (8–10) and allele-
specific extension (ASE) (11,12).
ASE on microarrays takes advantage of discrimination
properties of DNA polymerase in the extension of a 30-
terminus mismatch primer. Two allele-specific primers with
alternating 30-termini are designed to match one allele per-
fectly but mismatch the other allele at the 30-terminus. In this
way, allele-specific primer extension with fluorescent-labeled
nucleotides provides information about the presence or
absence of an allele that can be analyzed by a laser fluores-
cence scanner. In the case of homozygous template, one of the
allele-specific primers results in detectable product, while
poor extension of the other primer will be observed owing
to 30-terminus mismatched primer-template. A heterozygous
sample results in equal extension of both primers. Thus, fluor-
escent signal ratio between allele-specific primers scores the
genotype. This method has previously been employed to
identify single base variations, but it has been shown that

some mismatches are poorly discriminated by the DNA
polymerase (12–15). We have previously demonstrated that
the extension of mismatched configurations occurs with slower
reaction kinetics in comparison with the extension of the
matched primer-template configurations (16). In addition,
we demonstrated the use of a nucleotide-degrading enzyme
(apyrase) to kinetically distinguish genotypes in array-based
ASE assays (17–20). In the apyrase-mediated allele-specific
extension (AMASE), mismatch extensions are minimized
since apyrase degrades the nucleotides and prevents the exten-
sion of the slower mismatched primer-template. However,
in this work, we have further developed and modified the
AMASE approach by replacing apyrase with a thermostable
protein-degrading (digesting) enzyme (Proteinase K). In this
method, denoted as protease-mediated allele-specific exten-
sion (PrASE), we still take advantage of the fact that DNA
polymerase extends 30-termini mismatches with slower reac-
tion kinetics. The use of Proteinase K allows genotyping at
elevated reaction temperature as compared with thermolabile
apyrase, a feature that may be necessary when a thermostable
DNA or RNA polymerase is used for the extension of allele-
specific primers. In addition, a well-known factor in molecular
biotechnology is that low temperature is the major cause of
non-specific hybridization (21,22). This factor can cause prob-
lems in the AMASE assay especially in multiplex genotyping
assays, giving rise to signals from spurious hybridized primers.
Consequently, the novel PrASE assay permits stringent tem-
perature conditions that will lead to higher multiplex capab-
ility. Here, we demonstrate the use of Proteinase K in a 13-plex
SNP analysis. Simultaneous detection is achieved on a tag
microarray using individual tags of the extension primers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microarray preparation and spatial separation of
samples
Forty-eight oligonucleotide tags functioning as probe captures
on the glass slide were taken from www.genome.wi.mit.edu
(9) (Table 1). The tags containing a 50-poly(T) spacer of
15 thymine residues were synthesized by MWG-Biotech
AG (Ebersberg, Germany) with a 50-terminus amino link
with a C6 spacer (to facilitate covalent immobilization to
the pre-activated slides). The oligonucleotides were suspended
at a concentration of 20 mM in 150 mM sodium phosphate,
pH 8.5 and 0.06% sarkosyl and were spotted with a Q-array
(Genetix, Hampshire, UK) on Code Link activated slides
(Amersham Biosceinces, Uppsala, Sweden). Sarkosyl was
added to the spotting solution as it improved spot uniformity.
After printing, the arrays were incubated overnight in a humid
chamber followed by post coupling as outlined by the manu-
facturer. Briefly, the slides were incubated at 50C for 15 min
in a blocking solution (50 mM ethanol amine, 0.1 M Tris,
pH 9 and 0.1% SDS), rinsed twice in dH2O and washed
with pre-warmed (50C) 4· SSC/0.1% SDS for 15–60 min
on a shaker (20· SSC contains 175.3 g/l NaCl, 88.2 g/l sodi-
umcitrate, pH 7; and 10% SDS contains 100 g/l SDS, pH 7.2).
The arrays were then rinsed in dH2O and dried by centrifu-
gation for 3 min at 800 r.p.m.
The 48 oligonucleotides were printed in 48 identical arrays
(an array of arrays) on the slide and each array contained
triplicates of each oligonucleotide. The 48 sub-arrays were
separated during hybridization by a reusable silicone mask
(Elastosile1 RT 625 A/B, Wacker–Chemie GmbH, Munich,
Germany), molded in an inverted 384-well plate and excised to
fit the slide (11). A Custom made rack was used to press the
silicone firmly to the slide and keep it in place during the
reactions.
SNP positions
Thirteen SNP positions were selected for this study. The ref-
erence sequence numbers, the allele alternatives and the chro-
mosomal locations of the SNPs are rs17429 (C/T) (Xq28),
rs1799841 (T/C) (20p11), rs203319 (A/G) (22q13), rs752118
(C/T) (20q13), rs1800598 (C/T) (11q23), rs752744 (A/G)

Samples and multiplex PCR amplification
Genomic DNA extracted from blood from 36 healthy Swedish
individuals (named 1–36) was used in the analysis. The 13
SNPs were amplified in a nested PCR by a multiplex outer
PCR (30 cycles of 95C for 20 s, 55C for 40 s and 72C
for 30 s) followed by multiplex inner PCR (40 cycles of 95C
for 20 s, 55C for 40 s and 72C for 30 s). The rationale for
employing a nested PCR approach was to perform multiplex
amplification without putting efforts in PCR optimization. In
addition, since a small fraction of the outer products is trans-
ferred to the inner reactions, the outer PCRs can be used for
different analytical investigations without the use of original
genomic material. Prior to PCR cycles, the DNA was dena-
tured at 95C for 5 min and after PCR cycling the reactions
were incubated at 72C for 10 min. The reaction volume in the
outer PCR was 50 ml, containing 2.5 ng genomic DNA as
starting material. An aliquot of 0.5 ml of the outer PCR product
was transferred to the inner PCR with a reaction volume of
50 ml. The outer and inner multiplex PCR contained 1 U
AmpliTaq Platinum DNA polymerase (Invitrogen AB,
Lindingo, Sweden), 1· PCR buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl, pH
8.4, 50 mM KCl], 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs and
0.05 mM of each primer.
The outer forward and reverse PCR primers were located
16 nt upstream and downstream of the SNP positions, respect-
ively, generating outer PCR products of 71 bp. The inner
biotin-labeled primers were located only 2 nt from the SNP
position, while the non-biotinylated primers had a distance of
6 nt to the SNPs. This approach generated inner PCR products
between 46 and 52 bp. The 50 end biotinylated primers are used
to allow immobilization of PCR products to super paramag-
netic beads. The sequence of all PCR primers is outlined in
Table 2.
Sample preparation, hybridization and specific
extensions
The procedures of PCR product immobilization, washing,
annealing of 30-terminus allele-specific primers and the
multiplex ASEs were automated by the use of a Magnatrix
1200 pipetting robot system capable of handling magnetic
beads (Magnetic Biosolutions, Stockholm, Sweden). An ali-
quot of 200 mg streptavidin-coated super paramagnetic
beads (Dynabeads M280; Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were used
to immobilize each multiplexed inner PCR product. After
immobilization and wash with a binding/washing buffer
(10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 1 mM
b-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% Tween-20), single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) was obtained by alkali elution (0.1 M NaOH
for 5 min at room temperature) of the non-biotinylated strand.
The supernatant was discarded and the beads were washed
once with Tris-EDTA. A mixture (total volume of 60 ml)
containing 0.08 mM of each extension primer (two 30-terminus
allele-specific primers per SNP) (Table 3), 1· annealing buffer
(AB) (10 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.75, 2 mM Mg-acetate) and
0.5 mg single-stranded binding protein (SSB) [in-house pro-
duced (23) and also available from Amersham Biosciences]
was added to the immobilized ssDNA (SSB was included to
obtain specific annealing). Each ASE primer contained a spe-
cific tag at its 50 end. A comparison of Tables 1 and 3 shows
that each tag on the glass slide is complementary to one of the
tags on the ASE primers. The ASE primers were allowed to
anneal to the captured strands at 72C for 3 min, 50C for 7 min
and 40C for 1 min. The excess of primers was discarded and
the immobilized ssDNA was washed once with 1· AB and
then resolved in 1· AB to a volume of 20 ml.
The PrASE reaction was performed at 45C by adding first
20 ml of a solution containing 10 U exonuclease-deficient
(exo) Klenow DNA polymerase [in-house produced (24)
and also available from New England Biolabs, Beverly,
MA], 1· extension buffer (EB) (42.5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8,
5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT) and 0.25% BSA to the ssDNA.
This mixture was set to incubate for 1 min before 20 ml of a
second mixture containing 1.5 mM of each dNTP [50% Cy5-
labeled dCTP and dTTP (Amersham Biosciences)], 2· EB,
0.5% BSA and 20 mg of Proteinase K was added to initiate the
extension by exo Klenow polymerase and simultaneously
terminate the extension by degradation of the Klenow poly-
merase by the protease. This competitive enzymatic reaction
was incubated at 45C for 1 min. The conventional allele-
specific primer extension was carried out with the same reac-
tion conditions but the enzyme Proteinase K was omitted.
After polymerization, the enzymes and dNTPs were dis-
carded and immobilized DNA was washed with 1· AB.

To release the extended primers, the immobilized DNA was
treated with 7 ml of 0.1 M NaOH (5 min at room temperature)
and the supernatants, i.e. the PrASE products were neutralized
with 0.1 M HCl and 10· AB to a total volume of 16 ml. An
aliquot of 16 ml of 2· hybridization buffer (HB) (10· SSC,
0.4% SDS) and 0.5 mg SSB was finally added to a total volume
of 32 ml.
The fluorescently labeled PrASE products, each containing
a specific signature tag at the 50 end, were then hybridized to
the generic tag arrays on the glass slide for 60 min at 50C.
After hybridization, the slide was washed with 50C pre-
warmed 2· SSC/0.1% SDS for 6 min, then with 0.2· SSC
at room temperature for 1 min and finally with 0.1· SSC at
room temperature for 1 min. After the washing steps, the slide
was dried by a brief centrifugation.
Data analysis
Data were obtained by scanning the slide with an Agilent
scanner (Agilent Technologies, CA), generally optimal with
the laser power at 40% (to avoid saturated signals at 100%).
Data were analyzed using the GenePix Pro 5.0 software (Axon
instruments). The median local background intensities were
subtracted from the median intensities of the spots by GenePix
Pro 5.0 and the data were analyzed in Microsoft Excel, where
the mean values of fluorescence intensities of the triplicates
for each signature tag were used to calculate the allelic
fractions of the 13 SNPs for each individual.
Effect of Proteinase K on extension length
To investigate the effect of Proteinase K on primer extension,
we designed four synthetic oligonucleotide templates based on
the sequence of SNP 13. All four templates were designed to
match the extension primer for the C-allele of SNP 13. Two
extra nucleotides were included at the 30 end of the synthesized
templates to generate mismatches to the extension primer and
avoid extension of the synthesized templates. Each of the four
oligonucleotide templates was designed to contain only one
G-nucleotide (downstream of the annealed primer). This
G-nucleotide was situated 5, 10, 15 or 20 nt downstream of
the annealed primer, respectively. To be able to investigate the
effect of Proteinase K on the extension event, the reactions
were carried out with only Cy5-labeled dCTPs together with
native dTTP, dATP and dGTP. The extension length was
analyzed by both ASE and PrASE with three different amounts
(20, 40 and 80 mg) of Proteinase K.
Removal of extension primer excess
To evaluate the importance of a liquid-phase PrASE, where it
is possible to immobilize and wash biotinylated templates by
robotic systems capable of handling magnetic beads, we per-
formed the PrASE and hybridization to the tag microarray with
and without wash after primer annealing. The wash step thus
serves to remove the excess of extension primers. Six indi-
viduals (individuals 1, 7, 13, 19, 25 and 31) were investigated
and PrASE was performed for all 13 SNPs with and without
removal of the excess of primers. This comparison was prac-
tically possible by the addition of extension primers after the
PrASE reaction. After the PrASE reaction, the mixture was
divided into two halves of 15 ml each. To one half of the PrASE
products, we added an extension primer solution (0.08 mM of
each primer) and to the other half 1· AB. The primer solution
in the first mixture (half) corresponds to the amounts that are
washed away by the robot after primer annealing. The solu-
tions were then hybridized to the generic tag arrays and the
data were analyzed. The comparison data analysis (for each
individual) was performed by calculating the signal intensities
from all spots (26 allele-specific primers in triplicates) and
then taking an average of total signal intensities.

Effect of multiplex PrASE genotyping
In order to evaluate the effect of multiplexing in terms of
sensitivity of the PrASE, 12 different PrASE reactions were
performed in a ladder from a simplex with only one pair of
ASE primers to a multiplex of 12 primer pairs, i.e. a multiplex
PrASE of 12 SNPs for sample (individual) number 27. One of
the 13 SNPs, SNP 13 (rs740841), was left out owing to the
design of the robot.
Investigation of SNP 1 (rs17429)
To control that the assay works for SNP 1 (rs17429), which
only generated homozygous genotypes for the wild-type
allele C in the investigated individuals, a synthetic oligonuc-
leotide template for each allele (i.e. SNP 1 C-template and
SNP 1 T-template) was ordered. The templates correspond to
the inner PCR products of the SNP. The synthetic templates
were investigated by PrASE in three different reactions. The
reactions contained 2 pmol of SNP 1 C-template, 2 pmol of
SNP 1 T-template and 1 pmol of each C- and T-templates,
respectively.
Pyrosequencing
Pyrosequencing was performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) on 8 individuals (18,
20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 33 and 34), where 12 of the 13 SNPs were
genotyped (SNP 7 excluded), generating 96 genotypes, i.e. one
96-well plate. The individuals were first amplified with sim-
plex inner PCR for each of the 12 SNPs. The pyrosequencing
primers were located 2 nt from the SNP position.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Different assays have been developed for high-throughput
SNP genotyping, where microarray-based formats are
preferable. Here, we have utilized the polymerase ability to
discriminate between extensions of 30-terminus matched and
mismatched allele-specific primers in the presence of Pro-
teinase K, a protein-degrading enzyme. This is facilitated
by the differences in kinetics of matched and mismatched
primer elongation. Only perfectly matched primers are thus
extended, while in the case of slower reaction kinetics
(mismatched primer extension) the protease degrades the
polymerase before any nucleotides are incorporated. The
method of PrASE was employed to analyze 13 SNPs in 36
individuals in a multiplex assay using generic tag arrays for
the detection of the SNP alleles.
The principle of the novel PrASE method for multiplex SNP
genotyping is shown in Figure 1. A nested PCR, in which both
outer and inner reactions are multiplexed, is designed to yield
71 bp and 46–52 bp outer and inner PCR products, respect-
ively. One of the inner PCR primers is biotinylated to facilitate
immobilization onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and
to render the target DNA single stranded. Immobilized ssDNA
can be obtained by alkali elution of the non-biotinylated
strand and, thus, ASE may be performed either on the eluted
non-biotinylated strand or on the immobilized strand. To
maximize the signal intensity as well as to develop an auto-
mated protocol, we chose to perform the extensions on the
solid support (see below). Nevertheless, after hybridization of
30-terminus allele-specific primers, the extension reaction with
fluorescently labeled nucleotides accompanied with protease
is performed on the beads. As shown in Figure 1, the allele-
specific extended products are released by alkali elution, neut-
ralized and hybridized to a generic tag array.
The efficiency of the protease was investigated by the
analysis of the number of incorporated nucleotides in the
PrASE reaction. Without the inclusion of protease in the reac-
tion, the extension would continue to the end of the template.
Instead, the addition of Proteinase K in the reaction is expected
to terminate the extension after incorporation of a limited
number of nucleotides (owing to the degradation of the poly-
merase). Thus, to perform this investigation, four synthetic
oligonucleotide templates corresponding to the sequence of
SNP 13 were designed. The templates were modified to only
contain one G-nucleotide, positioned 5, 10, 15 or 20 nt down-
stream of the annealed primer, respectively. Extensions with
different amounts of Proteinase K (0, 20, 40 and 80 mg) were
performed where only nucleotide dCTP was Cy5-labled, while
the other 3 nt were native. In this way, the number of nucle-
otides that are incorporated during the polymerase extension
can be estimated by comparing the signals for the four differ-
ent templates. If Proteinase K is omitted in the reaction, the
extension would continue to the end of the template and,
therefore, we would detect signals from all four templates.
On the other hand, with inclusion of Proteinase K, the exten-
sion reactions will terminate after incorporation of some nuc-
leotides and only generate signals from the templates with a
G-nucleotide close to the extension primer. As shown in
Figure 2, the signal intensities decline with higher amounts
of Proteinase K. This decrease is more evident for the tem-
plates with an incorporated labeled nucleotide that is distanced
15 and 20 nt from the start of the polymerization. The normal
amount of Proteinase K that we use in the PrASE reactions is
20 mg and as it can be seen, this amount allows incorporation
of at least 10 nt. However, in a normal PrASE reaction, 2 nt
(C and T) are fluorescently labeled to ensure incorporation
of at least one labeled nucleotide. With higher amounts of
Proteinase K, such as 40 and 80 mg, it is still possible to
generate signals from the ‘5’ and ‘10’ nt templates, but too
weak for the templates with G-nucleotide at longer distance.
A robotic procedure capable of performing different steps
was developed. This automated system facilitates immobiliza-
tion of the biotin-labeled fragments and consequently allows
washing of the buffers and other solutions. One of these steps
involves annealing of allele-specific primers and removal/
wash of the excess of the primers (i.e. the primers that have
not been annealed) and has proven to be important in improv-
ing the sensitivity. Since the excess and potentially non-
extended primers also contain signature tags, these will
hybridize to the tags on the microarray. Thus, by removing
the excess of primers, a considerably higher signal is obtained.
This is exemplified in Figure 3, in which six individuals
(number 1, 7, 13, 19, 25 and 31) were compared with and
without removal of extension primers. Figure 3 shows a direct
comparison between average signal intensities for the 13
investigated SNPs (see below) using the PrASE protocol. At
least a 15-fold difference in average signal intensity can be
seen in all six individuals. This demonstrates the advantage to
remove the excess of unannealed primers to achieve a system
with higher sensitivity. However, it should be mentioned that
PAGE 5 OF 10 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5 e48
the increased sensitivity did not affect the specificity and in
both cases the PrASE reactions gave similar genotyping results.
A high-throughput SNP genotyping assay requires high
multiplexing capacity with high sensitivity. In order to evalu-
ate the effect of multiplexing in the detection steps, 12 dif-
ferent PrASE reactions were performed in a ladder from a
simplex with only one extension primer pair to a multiplex
of 12 primer pairs (i.e. a multiplex PrASE of 12 SNPs). One of
the SNPs, SNP 13, was not included owing to the design of the
robot with a 12-pipette head. Figure 4 shows the logarithmic
light signal intensities of all the 12 SNPs at different degrees of
multiplexing. As shown in Figure 4, the signal intensities are
linear and do not decrease by increased level of multiplexing.
Consequently, as the multiplex PrASE assay shows no
decrease in sensitivity in comparison with a simplex assay,
the limitations of the degree of multiplexing rather lies in the
multiplex PCR.
As mentioned above, a total of 36 individuals were analyzed
by the ASE assay based on the extension kinetics of the
polymerase and the protease. In order to evaluate the accuracy
of the technique, 12 of the 13 SNPs (SNP 7, rs752471
excluded) were analyzed with pyrosequencing (25,26) on 8
of the 36 individuals used in this study. The sequences
obtained by pyrosequencing were all manually checked and
edited. The PrASE results correlated 100% with the unam-
biguous pyrosequencing results (data not shown). However,
one genotype obtained by pyrosequencing (SNP 13, rs740841,
for individual 22) generated an ambiguous sequence (data not
shown).
To evaluate the effect of a protease on genotyping and
accuracy of ASE reactions, the genotype results of the 36
individuals were compared both with and without inclusion
of protease. Figure 5 exemplifies raw data image of PrASE
(left) and conventional ASE (right) for individual 13. As
shown, each array block contains identical spots in triplicate.
Here in Figure 5, the first replicate has been used to illustrate
the position of pairs of signature tags representing allele-
specific primers for each SNP. For example, the spots in
Figure 1. Schematic drawing of the PrASE procedures. A nested multiplex PCR amplification is performed with biotinylated inner PCR primers, generating short
PCR products. The biotinylated PCR products are immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and ssDNA is generated by alkali elution of the non-
biotinylated strand followed by annealing of ASE primers to the immobilized DNA strands. A washing step, where unannealed extension primers are removed, is then
followed by PrASE with Cy5-labeled dCTPs and dUTPs. The last steps involve removal of unreacted nucleotides and PrASE enzymes, release of PrASE products by
alkali elution and hybridization to tag microarrays. All procedures except the last step of hybridization to tag arrays are automated.

the first square are representing allele-specific primers for
SNP 1. The ovals in the second replicate indicate the SNPs
with similar genotyping results in ASE and PrASE. The ovals
in the third replicate, however, show where PrASE and ASE
give conflicting genotypes. As compared with the clusters
diagrams (see Figure 6), the PrASE results are correct when
disagreement(s) with ASE occur.
To analyze the genotypes of the SNPs, the extension signals
from the allele-specific primer pairs were used. The relative
allelic fractions were calculated by taking the fluorescent
signal intensity from spot1/(spot1 + spot2), where spot1 and
spot2 correspond to primer extension of the first and the
second allele, respectively (16), and are the mean value
from the triplicates. This calculation gives allelic fractions
of 0.5 for heterozygous and close to 0 and 1, respectively,
for the homozygous samples.
To illustrate the results, the 13 SNPs are plotted in separate
diagrams in Figure 6. The cluster diagrams are shown both for
PrASE (blue upper panel) and ASE (red lower panel), for the
individual SNPs. As can be seen, when Proteinase K is omitted
Figure 2. The effect of a protease on extension length. Four synthetic templates
have been analyzed by conventional ASE and PrASE with three different
amounts of Proteinase K (20, 40 and 80 mg). The templates only contain
one G-nucleotide, at different distances downstream of the extension primer,
and differ from each other only by the G position. The primers are then extended
with Cy5 labeled dCTPs together with native dGTPs, dATPs and dUTPs,
generating a signal only if the incorporated nucleotides cover the
G-nucleotide position. The fluorescent signal obtained by ASE (0mg Proteinase
K), where the extension is not hindered, has been used to normalize the fluor-
escence signals acquired by the PrASE reactions. Note that the fluorescent
signals from the extended primers are normalized to the signals from the
ASE reactions (black bars). The standard deviations are based on analysis
of nine data points.
Figure 3. The effect of removal of unannealed extension primers on signal
intensities on the arrays. Six individuals have been analyzed by PrASE on tag
arrays both with and without the washing away of excess primers. The different
individuals in this analysis are indicated on the x-axis. The y-axis shows an
average of total signal intensities (for 13 SNPs) obtained for each individual.
Figure 4. The effect of multiplexing on the sensitivity of PrASE. The
logarithmic value of the total signal intensity for each SNP ( y-axis) is
plotted toward the number of SNPs, i.e. the degree of multiplexing in the
PrASE reaction. A total of 12 different PrASE reactions were performed,
from a simplex to a 12-plex, where SNP 1 has been analyzed in all 12 reactions
down to SNP 12, which only has been analyzed in the 12-plex. To achieve the
different degrees of multiplexing, simplex PCR products for each of the 12
SNPs were pooled.

ASE (right). The 13 SNPs are in triplicates, where in the first replicate the SNP
positions are marked with white squares in the order of SNP 1 to 13 from upper
left to lower right corner. In the second replicate, the SNPs with similar results in
both PrASE and ASE are marked (white ovals), while the third replicate
indicates conflicting results between PrASE and ASE (marked with white
ovals). Note that all spotted tags (48) were not used in this assay (indicated
with white slashed boxes).

Figure 6. Genotyping results for PrASE (blue upper panels) and ASE (red lower panels). The 36 analyzed samples are visualized in 13 cluster diagrams for each SNP.
The x-axes represent allelic fractions that are calculated by the equation spot1/(spot1 + spot2), where spot1 and spot2 correspond to fluorescent signal intensity from
primer extension of the first and the second allele, respectively. The y-axes represent logarithmic value of the total fluorescent signal intensity. Circles indicate
the different genotypes, where samples scored as heterozygous are situated in the middle circle with an optimal allelic fraction close to 0.5. Homozygous samples for
the first allele and the second allele are located in the circles with allelic fractions close to 1 and 0, respectively. Note that, for SNP 10, the scoring with ASE is
impossible, while PrASE generates distinct clusters.
e48 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5 PAGE 8 OF 10
in the allele-specific reactions, the clusters are not as well
distinguished as in the case of PrASE. In fact, for SNP 10,
the genotyping by ASE is completely incorrect and no sep-
aration of the clusters can be observed. Furthermore, for SNP
13, the genotypes generated by ASE with allelic fractions
around 0.8 could belong to either the heterozygous C/T or
the homozygous C cluster, but are well separated with
PrASE. For SNP 4, the clusters for homozygous C and het-
erozygous C/T are very close to each other. In addition, the
cluster for homozygous T is situated approximately at allelic
fraction 0.5 (an indication of heterozygous samples). The sum
of these observations for SNP 4 makes it difficult to accurately
and robustly genotype this SNP with ASE. The same problem
can be seen for SNP 12, where the clusters are close to each
other. However, the case of SNP 12 is not as difficult as SNP 4.
Nevertheless, while many of the SNPs, genotyped with ASE,
show difficulties in discrimination of matched and mismatched
primers, addition of Proteinase K in the PrASE renders distinct
and partitioned clusters.
Table 4 shows in detail the allele scores for each SNP in
the 36 samples. These results show that all possible alleles
of homozygous and heterozygous could be detected in 12 of
the 13 investigated SNPs. However, owing to low frequency of
minor allele for SNP 1, it was not possible to score the T-allele
in any of the analyzed 36 individuals. To ensure that the
oligonucleotides for this SNP (tags on the microarrays and
the ASE primer for the T-allele) were correctly synthesized
and worked properly, a synthetic oligonucleotide template for
each allele (i.e. SNP 1C template and SNP 1T template) were
designed. The templates correspond to the inner PCR products
of the SNP. The synthetic templates were investigated
by PrASE in three different reactions, as homozygous for
wild-type (CC), as homozygous for mutant (TT) and as het-
erozygous (CT). The PrASE reactions on C and T templates
generated homozygous genotypes and the mixture of the
templates was scored as heterozygous (data not shown).
In conclusion, this study demonstrates a novel approach for
multiplex SNP genotyping based on 30-terminus ASE. To
enhance the accuracy of ASE reactions and prevent non-
specific extension of 30-termini primers, a protein-degrading
enzyme was included in the reactions. Thirteen SNPs were
accurately genotyped in 36 individuals by obtaining complete
partitioned clusters for each SNP. The multiplex genotyping
was facilitated by the use of generic tag arrays, which is a

flexible alternative to extension on the array surface (17). At
least 15-fold increased sensitivity and consequently increased
signal-to-noise was achieved by removal of the excess and
unannealed signature tag primers. This was accomplished by
an automated solid-phase magnetic bead system, which also
enabled automation of all steps after PCR amplification until
hybridization to the tag arrays. The effect of protease on the
extension length was also investigated and we conclude that in
the cases where a controlled extension length is desired the
PrASE system can be employed. In addition, increased level of
multiplexing did not affect the signal intensity, which is prom-
ising for future application of the PrASE assay with higher
level of multiplex genotyping.
