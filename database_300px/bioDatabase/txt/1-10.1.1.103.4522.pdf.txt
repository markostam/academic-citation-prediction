ABSTRACT
Taiwan Polymorphic Marker Database (TPMD) (http://
tpmd.nhri.org.tw/) is a marker database designed
to provide experimental details and useful marker
information allelotyped in Taiwanese populations
accompanied by resources and technical supports.
The current version deposited more than 372 000
allelotyping data from 1425 frequently used and
fluorescent-labeled microsatellite markers with
variation types of dinucleotide, trinucleotide and
tetranucleotide.TPMDcontains text andmapdisplays
with searchable and retrievable options for marker
names, chromosomal location in various human
genome maps and marker heterozygosity in popula-
tions of Taiwanese, Japanese and Caucasian. The
integration of marker information in map display is
useful for the selection of high heterozygosity and
commonly used microsatellite markers to refine
mapping of diseases locus followed by identification
of disease gene by positional candidate cloning.
In addition, our results indicated that the number of
markers with heterozygosity over 0.7 in Asian popu-
lations is lower than that in Caucasian. To increase
accuracy and facilitate genetic studies using micro-
satellitemarkers,wealso listmarkerswithgenotyping
difficulty due to ambiguity of allele calling and recom-
mend an optimal set of microsatellite markers for
genotyping in Taiwanese, and possible extension of
genotyping in other Mongoloid populations.
INTRODUCTION
Microsatellites, the short (1–13 bp) tandem nucleotide repeats,
are found to comprise 3% but ubiquitously throughout the
human genome (1). The average density of microsatellites in
human genome is approximately one microsatellite per 2 kb.
However, only a small fraction of microsatellites with proper-
ties such as high heterozygosity, known position along the
genetic map, strong and specific fragment after PCR and
easy scoring of allele sizes are suitable for developing as
genotyping markers. Genetic markers based on PCR-amplified
microsatellites have been extremely important in human
genetic studies owing to their high degree of length poly-
morphism among individuals in human populations (2–4).
The use of fluorescent-labeled microsatellite markers and frag-
ment analysis by automatic DNA sequencer has led to wide-
spread applications in studies of population genetics (5) and
in biomedical researches including human disease mapping
studies for positional cloning (6,7), detection of allelic
imbalance or loss of heterozygosity on cancer genome
(8,9), diagnosis of expanded triplet repeat loci in several
neurodegenerative diseases (10) and human identification in
forensic analysis or parentage testing (11,12). In large-scale
genotyping studies, although consistent and accurate allele
sizing and data handling required careful selection of markers
with high heterozygosity in selected population, genotyping

by using microsatellite markers remained the most convenient
and low cost technology. Since length polymorphism of
microsatellites is population-dependent and since estimation
of allele frequency is essential for successful linkage analysis
(13,14), a shared database and resources for genotyping with
microsatellite markers will not only reduce cost and errors of
genotyping but also facilitate disease gene mapping in human
populations. To achieve these aims, the Taiwan Polymorphie
Marker Database (TPMD) was formally launched in public
domain in June 2001. In addition, the Applied Taiwan Geno-
typing Consortium (ATGC) was formed from four qualified
laboratories with identical training, experimental protocols
and conventional quality control DNAs (CEPH 1331-01
and 1331-02) for data expansion of TPMD and from several
laboratories for promoting genetic studies of prevalent inher-
ited disease in Taiwan. The newly launched TPMD website
contains two major sections including the database for sharing
useful microsatellite marker information and the resources for
supporting consistent genotyping experiments.
DATABASE OF MICROSATELLITE MARKERS
Currently, the database contains more than 364 440 allelotyp-
ing data genotyped in Han Chinese of Taiwan from 1425
commonly used microsatellite markers with average marker
density 2.3 cM and variation types of dinucleotide (856,
60%), trinucleotide (97, 6.8%) and tetranucleotide (470,
33.2%). Majority of microsatellite markers which are com-
mercially available are obtained from ABI PRISM Linkage
Mapping Set-version 1 and 2 (dinucleotide markers), and
Research Genetics CHLC Human Screening Set/Weber
Version 8 and Single Chromosome Human Screening Set (tri-
and tetranucleotide markers). There are 148 (10.4%) markers

synthesized in our laboratories based on UniSTS to meet the
needs of specific experiments or selection process of high
heterozygosity markers for constructing optimal marker set.
Two web interfaces with text and map displays were presented
in the TPMD. The text display provides searches of micro-
satellite marker either by marker name or by chromosomal
location with hyperlink to UniSTS and to TPMD for detail
allelotyping information such as heterozygosity, range of allele
sizes (base pair), genetic position (cM) and fluorescent labels.
To facilitate marker selection in refine mapping and positional
candidate cloning of disease genes in mapped loci, interfaces
for a graphic map display and retrieving markers from an
interesting chromosomal locus are developed. It features the
marker selection by position in cytogenetic, physical and
genetic maps with comparison of marker heterozygosity in
Caucasian, Japanese and Taiwanese populations (2,15,16).
With the integration of other microsatellite markers from
The Center for Medical Genetics at Marshfield Clinic and
DeCODE Genetics into human physical map display (2,17),
a total of 7932 commonly used microsatellite markers with
average marker density of 0.4 cM are integrated and should be
useful for marker selection in refine mapping of disease loci
and positional candidate cloning of disease genes.
GENOTYPING RESOURCES
To increase the consistency of allele calling and to avoid
redundant microsatellite marker genotyping, we summarized
and shared useful information for facilitating genotyping
experiments. In the resources pages, we provided our protocols
for microsatellite marker genotyping, while a list of markers
with atypical variation types resulted in difficulties of con-
sistent allele calling in our laboratories, and hence, we recom-
mend TPMD marker set with 10 cM resolution for optimal
genotyping among Taiwanese. Since marker heterozygosity,
especially for heterozygosity >0.7, is one of the important
factors for successful genotyping and linkage analysis,
we compared the distribution of marker heterozygosities gen-
otyped among Taiwanese, Japanese and Caucasian (Figure 1).
Our results indicated that the percentages of markers of
all variation types with heterozygosity >0.7 was 82, 73 and
65% in Caucasian, Japanese and Taiwanese populations,
respectively (Figure 1A). Similar results were observed in
panels of dinucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranucleotide
microsatellite markers genotyped in the mentioned earlier
three populations (Figure 1B–D). Indeed, except dinucleotide
marker D15S975 with higher heterozygosity in Taiwanese
(0.78) than that in Caucasian (0.44), the remaining 44 micro-
satellite markers show higher heterozygosity in Caucasian
than that in Taiwanese with a difference of heterozygosity
over 0.3 (Figure 1E). Our results further suggested that the
development of a set of microsatellite markers with high
heterozygosity would facilitate genotyping and genetic studies
of human diseases in Taiwanese. For establishing the optimal
set of microsatellite markers in Taiwanese in use of high-
throughput and low cost protocol, we selected tri- and
tetranucleotide markers with high heterozygosity and well-
separated alleles in electrophoresis as the majority of markers
in the optimal set. After careful experimental evaluation of
more than 760 microsatellite markers, a table with optimal
microsatellite marker set contained 363 microsatellite markers
(56 dinucleotide, 34 trinucleotide and 273 tetranucleotide
markers) with average heterozygosity >0.77 and average
marker density of 9.71 cM is included for genotyping in
Taiwanese population. Based on migration of human popula-
tions in Asia, the development of an optimal microsatellite
marker set should be potentially suitable for genotyping in
Mongoloid populations (18,19).
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
We aim to expand microsatellite marker genotyping data
in TPMD and increase marker density to 5 cM resolution
for optimal set of microsatellite markers in Taiwanese. The
qualified genotyping data from other populations including
aborigines of Taiwan will be included in the future. With
maturation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) geno-
typing technologies, we will incorporate SNP markers geno-
typed in Taiwanese started from high minor allele frequency
SNP markers.
