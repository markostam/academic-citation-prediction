ABSTRACT
Vaccinia virus DNA polymerase catalyzes duplex-by-
duplex DNA joining reactions in vitro and many
features of these recombination reactions are
reprised in vivo. This can explain the intimate linkage
between virus replication and genetic recombination.
However, it is unclear why these apparently ordinary
polymerases exhibit this unusual catalytic capacity.
In this study, we have used different substrates
to perform a detailed investigation of the mechanism
of duplex-by-duplex recombination catalyzed by
vaccinia DNA polymerase. When homologous,
blunt-ended linear duplex substrates are incubated
with vaccinia polymerase, in the presence of Mg2+
and dNTPs, the appearance of joint molecules is
preceded by the exposure of complementary single-
stranded sequences by the proofreading exonucle-
ase. These intermediates anneal to form a population
of joint molecules containing hybrid regions flanked
by nicks, 1–5 nt gaps, and/or short overhangs. The
products are relatively resistant to exonuclease (and
polymerase) activity and thus accumulate in joining
reactions. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) mea-
surements showed the enzyme has a relative binding
affinity favoring blunt-ended duplexes over mole-
cules bearing 30-recessed gaps. Recombinant dup-
lexes are the least favored ligands. These data
suggest that a particular combination of otherwise
ordinary enzymatic and DNA-binding properties,
enable poxvirus DNA polymerases to promote duplex
joining reactions.
INTRODUCTION
Poxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses that,
similar to many other virus and bacteriophage, are subjected
to very high frequencies of genetic recombination during
viral replication (1). Although our understanding of the
recombination systems used by most phage and virus is still
incomplete, many of these infectious agents encode exonucle-
ases and the activity of these enzymes can play a key role in
production of virus recombinants. For example bacteriophage
lambda encodes the Red system (comprising a DNA binding
protein and 50–30 exonuclease encoded by bet and exo genes,
respectively), and it is the Red enzymes that catalyze most of
the phage general homologous recombination detected in
replication-permitted crosses (2). HSV-1 encodes an alkaline
exonuclease that seems to serve a similar role in herpes virus
recombination (3) and the reverse transcriptase ribonuclease
H activity (although not strictly an exonuclease) plays a
key role in catalyzing retroviral reverse transcription and
recombination (4). Exonucleases are critically important
enzymes in most recombination pathways, but where dupli-
cated sequences exist they play a central role in catalyzing
what are broadly called ‘single-strand annealing’ (SSA) reac-
tions. This is a non-conservative and widely employed
method for producing recombinants (5). In the simplest
form of an SSA reaction, an exonuclease first attacks the
exposed ends of broken double-stranded DNAs, exposing
complementary regions on substrate molecules that can then
anneal through Watson–Crick base pairing. This produces
heteroduplex spanning the joint and the recombination of
sequences flanking the site of hybrid formation. The simplic-
ity of such systems stands in stark contrast to the more
complex and often redundant recombination pathways
employed by cellular organisms. However, these systems
serve other functions in conservative processes such as
meiotic recombination (6) and DNA repair (7) that may not
be quite so critical for virus biology.
Poxvirus recombination reactions show all the molecular
genetic hallmarks of simple SSA reactions including the
transient production of abundant hybrid DNA and evidence
of processing of joint regions by a 30–50 exonuclease (8,9).
Poxviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and
are generally viewed as encoding most or all of the machin-
ery necessary for virus DNA replication. Thus it is notable

that the only exonuclease encoded by Chordopoxvirus
genomes is that which comprises the 30–50 proofreading activ-
ity of poxvirus DNA polymerases. Nevertheless this seems
to suffice to meet the needs of virus biology, and highly
purified vaccinia virus DNA polymerase will catalyze single-
strand-by-duplex and duplex-by-duplex joining reactions
in vitro (10,11). This enzyme can also repair small gaps and
excise 30 ended single-stranded tails from model joint mole-
cules in vitro (12). These observations show that poxvirus
DNA polymerases are endowed with the enzymatic capacity
needed to form and (where necessary) repair joint molecules.
These non-covalently linked reaction products can then by
converted into fully duplex recombinants by the subsequent
activity of enzymes like poxvirus or cellular DNA ligases.
What is still unclear is what are the special biochemical
properties of poxvirus DNA polymerases that create the capacity
to catalyze duplex-by-duplex strand joining. These are seem-
ingly typical B-family DNA polymerases, endowed with 30–50
proofreading and 50–30 DNA synthetic activities. To our knowl-
edge these are the only members of the B-family of DNA
polymerases that can catalyze recombination-like reactions.
In this study we have examined this question using, as enzym-
atic substrates and binding partners, small oligonucleotide
duplexes. This permits a fine scale analysis of the kinetics
of excision and repair as it relates to the concurrent formation
to joint molecules. We have also used surface plasmon reso-
nance methods (SPR) to investigate the binding affinities exhib-
ited by the enzyme towards these substrates and putative
reaction products. Our results suggest that the 30–50 proofreading
exonuclease has a reduced enzymatic preference or binding
affinity for the products of these reactions (joint molecules bear-
ing simple nicks or 1–2 nt gaps) relative to the blunt-ended
duplexes that are used as substrates. These particular enzymatic
properties can do much to explain how poxvirus DNA
polymerases could serve a dual role as viral ‘recombinases’.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recombinant protein
Vaccinia virus DNA polymerase (>95% purity) was prepared
using the procedure of McDonald and Traktman (11,13,14).
The method removes the A20R processivity factor and the
protein is thus expected to interact with DNA in a distributive
manner (15,16).
Radioactive labeling of oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (Mis-
sissauga, Canada) or the DNA core facility, University of
Alberta. These DNAs were 50 end-labeled and purified as
described previously (12). Figure 2 illustrates the sequences
and structures of the DNAs used in these experiments. The
25mer and 30mer size markers have the same DNA sequence
as the predicted products of a 30-exonuclease attack on
labeled 45 and 50mer strands, thus ensuring better accuracy
in assigning the sizes of reaction products.
Preparation of double-stranded DNA joint substrates
Duplex substrates were prepared by mixing 0.3 nmol of
labeled oligonucleotide with 0.4 nmol of complementary
unlabeled oligonucleotide in MMLV reverse transcriptase
buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl and 3 mM
MgCl2] in a total volume of 40 ml. The mixture was boiled
for 1 min and then cooled slowly to 35C.
Only one of the two 30 ends on each of these duplex
substrates encodes the homology required by a SSA reaction.
To suppress exonucleolytic attack on the other 30 ended
strands, the substrates permit incorporation of a cidofovir res-
idue into these other 30 ends (17). The cidofovir addition reac-
tion contained the DNA duplexes described above, 20 U of
MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 0.1 M dithiothre-
itol, 100 mM cidofovir diphosphate (synthesized by Trilink
Technologies, San Diego), and 50 mM dATP or dTTP (Invit-
rogen). The reaction was incubated at 37C overnight, heated
to 70C for 10 min, and the DNA was purified by passage
through a Sephadex-25 spin column. In control experiments
we noted that this treatment did not completely block exo-
nuclease attack, but served the necessary purpose if reactions
were limited to times <30 min (data not shown). Biotinylated
oligonucleotides were prepared in the same way except we
substituted 40 mM N4-modified biotin-14-dCTP (Invitrogen)
for cidofovir diphosphate.
Strand joining reactions
Each 0.13 ml reaction normally contained 0.1 nmol of each
duplex substrate, 230 ng vaccinia virus DNA polymerase
(2 pmol), 15 mM dATP, 15 mM dCTP, 5 mM dGTP,
10 mM TTP, 30 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2,
70 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM DTT and 80 mg/ml acetylated BSA
(10). These starting concentrations of dNTPs were chosen
because they are thought to reflect the in vivo concentrations
in vaccinia-infected cells (18). The reaction was incubated at
37C with periodic sampling. Each aliquot was mixed with
twice-concentrated gel loading buffer [40% sucrose, 0.1 mg/
ml bromophenol blue, 0.1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, 0.2 ug/ml
Orange G and 20 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)] to stop the reaction.
The reaction products were separated by non-denaturing elec-
trophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels, the gels were dried,
and the distribution of the label determined using a Storm
phosphoimager and ImageQuant software (Amersham).
To test what effect the dNTP concentration has on the
efficiency of strand joining we used our original agarose-
based gel assay (10). Plasmid pBluescript II KS(+) DNAs
were cut with XhoI and HindIII (which creates molecules
sharing 21 bp of overlapping homology), and equimolar
quantities of DNA incubated with the polymerase and single-
strand binding proteins in the presence of different concentra-
tions of dNTPs. Substrates and products were separated by
agarose gel electrophoresis. These controls showed that
higher concentrations of dNTPs inhibit strand joining, but
this effect can be suppressed using longer incubation times
(Figure 1). Under the simplified conditions used in this
study [oligonucleotide substrates (Figure 2), 45 mM dNTP,
no single-strand binding protein we noted that the maximum
yield of joint molecules is seen after 20 min of incubation
(Figure 3).]
Second dimension analysis
Gels containing the separated products of the joining reaction
were stained with methylene blue to visualize the DNA. The
144 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 1
lane corresponding to each time point was cut from the gel,
sliced into sections, and the DNA extracted by crushing
each slice in 200 ml of 0.3 M sodium acetate in 10 mM
Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA and shaking overnight. The acry-
lamide was removed by centrifugation through aerosol-
resistant pipet tips (Axygen) and the DNA precipitated
using glycogen and three volumes of 95% ethanol. The pre-
cipitated DNA was washed once with 70% ethanol, dried and
resuspended in 10 ml TE. Each sample was mixed with 10 ml
of loading buffer [80% deionized formamide, 0.1 mg/ml bro-
mophenol blue, 0.1 mg/ml xylene cyanol and 20 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0)]. The samples were then denatured by heating to
56C and fractionated through a 10% polyacrylamide gel
containing 8 M urea and a 19:1 ratio of acrylamide to bis-
acrylamide. The gel was fixed with 10% (v/v) acetic acid
and 20% (v/v) methanol in water, dried on Whatman paper,
and subjected to phosphorimager analysis.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
Measurements were taken on a Biacore 2000 SPR instrument
using control software version 3.1. The sensor surface

containing an equimolar mixture of XhoI- and HindIII-cut pBluescript II
DNAs, vaccinia single-strand binding protein, and vaccinia DNA polymerase.
The reactions were supplemented with the indicated amounts of dNTPs. The
reactions were incubated for 20 or 60 min and the products separated by
agarose gel electrophoresis (upper panel) and quantified using ethidium
fluorescence (lower panel). The reaction midpoints are seen at 5 and 50 mM
dNTP for 20 and 60 min reactions, respectively.

consisted of a CM5 sensor chip to which a low level
[200 response units (RU)] of streptavidin had been amine
coupled. Biotinylated oligo complexes (FC1, FC3 and FC5)
were bound to flow cells 2, 3 and 4 of the sensor chip, respec-
tively, at a density of 50–100 RU. All remaining streptavidin
sites were blocked by injection of 5 mM D-biotin, including
flow cell 1 (the reference flow cell). Samples were diluted from
an enzyme stock into polymerase buffer containing 80 mg/ml
bovine serum albumin and stored in a chilled (4C) sample
block prior to injection. Concentrations of 100, 75, 50, 40, 30,
20, 10, 5, 1 and 0.1 nM were injected in duplicate in random
order for 2.5 min at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. Regeneration
was with 1 M NaCl between cycles. Responses from a control
flow cell containing biotin-blocked streptavidin, and a blank
injection with polymerase buffer, were subtracted from each
dataset to control for bulk refractive index changes. Datasets
were aligned, the reference subtracted, and fit to an equilibrium-
binding model using Scrubber version 1.1g, BIAevaluation
4.1, or Prism software. The data report standard errors.
RESULTS
Figure 2A shows the assay used to monitor duplex strand
joining (‘fusion’) reactions catalyzed by vaccinia virus DNA
polymerase. These assays originally used linearized
plasmid DNAs and/or PCR amplicons [Figure 1 and Ref.
(10)], but in this study we have substituted synthetic oligonu-
cleotide duplexes because using smaller DNAs facilitates
high-resolution analysis of the fusion process. We prepared
two double-stranded substrates [FC1 (45 bp) and FC2
(50 bp)], which share 20 bp of sequence homology
(Figure 2B, boldface text), and should be processed into a
75 bp recombinant product under strand joining conditions.
In order to limit the degradation of the duplex substrates to
just the ends encoding homologous sequences, the 30 ends
located distal to the regions of homology were protected
from exonuclease attack by filling in those ends with mole-
cules of cidofovir (see Materials and Methods). We have
previously shown that the polymerase and exonuclease activ-
ities of vaccinia DNA polymerase are greatly inhibited by
cidofovir located at the penultimate 30 end of the primer
strand (17).
Figure 3 shows the kinetics of conversion of these
substrates into recombinant products. Equal amounts of
32P-labeled FC1 and FC2 were incubated with vaccinia
DNA polymerase in the presence of physiological concentra-
tions of dNTPs in vaccinia virus infected cells (15 mM dATP,
15 mM dCTP, 5 mM dGTP and 10 mM TTP) (18). The initial
stages of the reaction are slow, with little visible change in
the migration of the two substrates. A trace quantity of
labeled residual single-stranded DNA was, however, degraded
immediately. Continued processing of FC1 and FC2 was
indicated by an increase in the mobility of the two substrates,
followed by the label being chased into larger recombinant
products. Between 16 and 24 min, the total amount of
DNA migrating as a product was approximately constant,
while the amount present as precursors declined by 50% as
judged by phosphorimager analysis. During this time, anal-
ysis of the phosphorimager signal also showed that 20%
of the input label was maximally converted into recombinant
products under these particular conditions. The gradual blur-
ring and eventual disappearance of these molecules seemed to
correlate with the timing of a slow exonuclease attack on the
unlabelled, cidofovir-containing, strand. During the later
stages of the reaction, all of the DNAs were converted into
what appeared to be a limit digest composed of a mixture
of di- and tri-nucleotides, which migrated together near the
electrophoresis front.
In order to determine the composition of the molecules
that were being formed during these reactions, DNA was
extracted from regions of the native gel comprising processed
substrates and annealed recombinants, and subjected to
further analysis by denaturing gel electrophoresis. This
involved excising each lane from the native gel, cutting
each lane into sections spanning the size ranges from 18
to 55 nt, extracting the DNA from each section, and subject-
ing the recovered DNA to denaturing gel electrophoresis
(Figure 4A). In these experiments we also labeled either
FC1 or FC2, but not both (as in Figure 3), to simplify the
interpretation of the resulting autoradiographs. Figure 4B
and C shows the results of this experiment. Overall, both
of the labeled strands in FC1 and FC2 were processed with
similar kinetics and into similar exonuclease products.
There was a slow degradation of the labeled strand at early
time points, followed by a more rapid degradation at later
Figure 3. Native gel analysis of the joining reaction. A joining reaction was
prepared containing 32P-labeled substrates FC1 and FC2 and Mg2+ and four
dNTPs, incubated at 37C, and aliquots removed and mixed with EDTA at
the indicated times to stop the reaction. Loading buffer was then added and
the samples subjected to electrophoresis using a non-denaturing 10%
polyacrylamide gel. After drying the gel, autoradiography was used to locate
the reaction products. A trace of unannealed strand can be seen at time zero
(‘*’). Vaccinia DNA polymerase degrades such single-stranded DNAs to
nucleotides within seconds under these reaction conditions (12).

time points. A few intermediary digestion products appeared
in the precursor lanes; many map near sites where pyrimidine
residues are located and which may be natural pause sites for
the proofreading exonuclease (12).
The appearance of substantial amounts of recombinant
product did not occur until there were processed precursors,
which had been degraded to the extent that the homologous
regions on both duplexes were nearly fully exposed. At
8 min, we began to see the presence of precursor (‘reactant’)
strands that showed evidence of the excision of 19–20 nt.
Product molecules started to appear shortly thereafter, about
8–12 min into the reaction. The kinds of excision products
that had been incorporated into these recombinant products
varied in size. We saw some molecules (marked with a ‘*’
in Figure 4B and C) that would permit the formation of
duplexes bearing a simple nick at the junction point. How-
ever, other types of 30-excision products were also present.
The largest proportion (45%) of the FC1-derived strands
were incorporated into the recombinants as 26mer
(Figure 4B), which would create a 1 bp overhang when paired
with the 50 end of the FC2-derived strand. Molecules of
shorter lengths were also observed, which would create
recombinants bearing small (1–5 bp) gaps. The processing
of the FC2-derived strand generated a similar variety of exci-
sion products, although in this case the predominant species
(25%) were strands processed to a size that could form
nicked recombinants (Figure 4C).
These observations suggested that vaccinia DNA poly-
merase may have a substrate preference which favors the
enzymatic modification of molecules not incorporated into
recombinant structures. To test this possibility directly, we
constructed two precursor analogs, FC3 and FC4
(Figure 2B), which bear gaps similar in size to those pro-
duced during processing of FC1 and FC2. We then compared
the rate of exonucleolytic attack upon one of these recessed
strands, depending upon whether or not this strand was incor-
porated into a nicked recombinant duplex. The results are
shown in Figure 5. Equimolar amounts of FC3 alone, or
FC3 annealed to FC4, were incubated with vaccinia DNA
polymerase and the reaction sampled at different time points.
The labeled strand being tracked on the gel was the same in
both substrates. We observed that the 32P-labeled strand in
FC3 was rapidly processed in the absence of FC4, being
either extended through DNA synthesis or degraded by the
exonuclease. At later stages in the reaction, the extended
products were also subjected to limited exonucleolytic attack.
In contrast, the target strand in the recombinant structure
comprising FC3+FC4 was far less susceptible to enzymatic
modification, with most molecules losing only a single nucle-
otide over the length of the experiment. Similar results were
obtained when FC4 was labeled (data not shown).
What is the fate of these gapped molecules, regardless of
whether they are produced through strand annealing
(Figures 3 and 4) or by subsequent exonuclease attack on
Figure 4. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of the joining reaction.

marks the location of strands, derived from a recombinant product, where the

and smaller excision products would create branched and gapped duplexes,
respectively.

nicked reaction products (Figure 5)? Liked nicked substrates,
molecules bearing small gaps are also relatively stable in the
presence of vaccinia DNA polymerase and dNTPs. Figure 6
shows a side-by-side comparison of the substrate properties
of FC1, FC3 and FC5 where FC5 comprises a DNA duplex
containing a small one-nucleotide gap (Figure 2B, the pur-
pose of the hairpin terminus is explained below). As previ-
ously noted, the unprotected 30 ended strand in FC1 is
attacked slowly in the presence of dNTPs (Figure 3) and
this 30 end is an excellent substrate for both the 30–50 exonu-
clease and the DNA polymerase in FC3 (Figure 5). However,
the one-nucleotide gap in FC5 is subjected to only limited
further modification by vaccinia DNA polymerase, insofar
as we detected the excision or addition of only 1–2 nt over
the course of these reactions. The majority of molecules
suffered no further net modification at all over the 28 min
incubation period (Figure 6).
The differences we saw in the experiments detailed above,
suggested that vaccinia DNA polymerase has a differential
affinity for substrates (linear duplex ends) versus reaction
products and that this difference in affinity would effectively
favor the formation and stabilization of recombinant prod-
ucts. To test whether this reflected absolute differences in
DNA binding properties, we used SPR to directly assess the
binding of vaccinia DNA polymerase to three different kinds
of molecules. These molecules were FC1, FC3 and FC5. FC1
comprises one of the two reaction substrates and FC3 and
FC5 model two examples of reaction products. In order to
perform this analysis we had to add a hairpin to the terminus
of FC5 (Figure 2B) so as to eliminate a 30 end that would
complicate the analysis of enzyme binding to a second inter-
nal 30 end, located next to the one-nucleotide gap. In order to
perform an SPR experiment a method is also required to
attach the DNA to the CM5 sensor surface. To do this, the
annealed substrates were labeled with biotin (substituting
biotinylated dCTP for cidofovir diphosphate) by filling in
one end of the duplex using N4 biotin-14-dCTP, dATP (or
dTTP), and reverse transcriptase. The sensor surface was cou-
pled with streptavidin, and the biotinylated FC1, FC3 and
FC5 molecules attached to three of the four chip surfaces at
a low surface density (50–100 RU). The last (fourth) section
of the sensor contained no DNA and served as a negative con-
trol for non-specific binding to biotin-blocked streptavidin.
To perform the binding analysis the sensor surface was
washed with Mg2+-free polymerase buffer, and then varying
concentrations of vaccinia DNA polymerase were passed
over the surface in the same buffer for 2.5 min to monitor
an association rate. The concentrations of polymerase used
ranged from 0.1 to 100 nM (0.01–10 mg/ml). Washing
with buffer permitted monitoring the dissociation rate.
Figure 7 shows the resulting duplicate binding curves, for
FC1, after subtracting the reference cell and blank injection
signals from the experimental data. By fitting these data to
a simple 1:1 equilibrium-binding model we established
apparent equilibrium-dissociation constants (KD) for FC1,
FC3 and FC5 of 7.0 ± 0.7, 18 ± 2 and 25 ± 4 nM, respec-
tively, using Prism software and BIAeval data points
(Figure 7, lower panel). Similar numerical results, and the
same trend, were obtained using BIAevaluation and Scrubber
software. The three methods of analysis suggest that vaccinia
virus DNA polymerase has a relative binding preference for
FC1 > FC3 > FC5.
Figure 5. Nicked joint products are metastable. A hypothetical gapped
recombinant intermediate (FC3) and a reconstructed recombinant product
(FC3 annealed to FC4) were treated with vaccinia DNA polymerase in the
presence of Mg2+ and four dNTPs. Aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with
loading buffer to stop the reaction. The DNA was then subjected to
denaturing PAGE and the label imaged by autoradiography.

24 and 28 min) and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by
autoradiography.

DISCUSSION
Vaccinia DNA polymerase can promote SSA reactions,
which lead to the fusion of homologous duplex DNAs
in vitro and can be used as a tool for assembling recombinant
molecules. Many of the features of the in vitro reaction are
also observed when linear DNAs are transfected into
poxvirus-infected cells, including the fact that using cidofovir
to block exonuclease activity (17) inhibits recombination
in vitro and in vivo and this block can be overcome by
virus encoding cidofovir-resistant (19) DNA polymerases
(D. Gammon and D. Evans, unpublished data). This strongly
suggests that the proofreading exonuclease activity of these
polymerases is also used by poxviruses to promote double-
strand break repair and recombination in vivo. This is an
unusual situation, because in all of the other exonuclease-
dependent recombination and repair systems characterized
to date, a specialized enzyme typically provides the nuclease
activity (e.g. RecBCD, RecJ, lambda Red exonuclease, HSV-
1 alkaline exonuclease, WRN exonuclease, Mre11, etc.).
Poxvirus genomes do not encode such specialized exonucle-
ases and have, instead, seemingly adapted the DNA
polymerase to serve this function. However, this raises ques-
tions regarding the nature of these enzymatic adaptions. In
this study we have examined the behavior of the enzyme
when presented with DNAs resembling the substrates, puta-
tive intermediates, and representative products of these strand
joining reactions. Our observations suggest a straightfor-
ward explanation for how vaccinia DNA polymerase might
catalyze this unusual reaction.
The DNA joining reactions are readily followed using gel
electrophoresis and 45 and 50 bp substrates that are rapidly
converted into 75 bp joint molecules (Figure 3). Using
high-resolution denaturing gel electrophoresis it was observed
that the 30–50 exonuclease activity processed the reacting
strands (FC1 and FC2) into a variety of gapped molecules,
and that a subset of these gapped species were then
selectively incorporated into metastable reaction products
(Figures 3 and 4). Close inspection of the reaction kinetics
shows that exposure of most of the homology precedes
the appearance of joint molecules, spontaneous annealing
probably then creates joint molecules. Only a small fraction
of the reaction products likely bear simple nicks on both
sides of the 20 nt region of homology, due to some variability
in the extent of strand excision (Figure 4B and C). However
the mixture of nicks, short-unpaired extensions, and small
gaps do not destabilize the joint molecules enough to inhibit
joint molecule formation. Such nicks gaps and extensions
would also be readily repaired by bacterial enzymes follow-
ing the transfection of in vitro reaction products into E.coli,
which would explain how the method can be used to produce
recombinant clones in bacteria (10).
The transient stability of the duplex joints seen in Figure 3
is probably an important feature of this reaction. The effect is
much better illustrated in Figure 5 where we directly compare
how vaccinia DNA polymerase processes a nick-containing
recombinant duplex (FC3 annealed to FC4) with the effects
of the enzyme upon a gapped precursor of this molecule
(FC3 alone). The joint molecule is very stable, suffering
only limited attack by the exonuclease, whereas FC3 is sub-
jected to a mixture of primer extension and modification by
the exonuclease. We have previously noted that duplex mole-
cules bearing longer unpaired 30 extensions are also rapidly
processed by vaccinia DNA polymerase into metastable
structures bearing small nicks and gaps (12). These are all
reaction features that greatly favor the formation, processing,
and transient stabilization of recombinant products.

Methods. The upper panel shows the observed changes in the SPR signal [in
arbitrary response units (RU)] when buffers containing different concentra-
tions of polymerase were flowed over a chip surface coated with FC1 at 37C.
Each binding curve was measured in duplicate followed by washing with
polymerase-free buffer. Magnesium and dNTPs were omitted from the
reaction buffer to prevent enzymatic modification of the DNA substrates. The
on–off rates are too fast to be measured with satisfactory accuracy by this
method, so the KD values were calculated from a curve fit (R
2 ¼ 0.98) to the
effects of enzyme concentration upon the equilibrium-binding signal (lower
panel).

These observations suggest that vaccinia polymerase might
exhibit binding properties that favors binding 30 ends located
within either duplex substrates (FC1) or embedded within a
classic primer-template structure (FC3), and disfavors bind-
ing to nicks or small gaps. To test this hypothesis we used
SPR methods and another substrate that utilizes a hairpin
structure to eliminate the 30-terminus of the duplex end
(FC5). FC5 can thus provide a test of the enzyme’s affinity
for recombinant reaction products, if one makes the not un-
reasonable assumption that the hairpin structure is an unlikely
alternate binding site. Like the nicks in FC3/FC4, the one
base gap in FC5 is subjected to only limited enzymatic pro-
cessing by the polymerase, although in this substrate the one-
nucleotide gap in the primer strand mostly suffers no further
net modification (Figure 6) rather than suffer a loss of 1
or 2 nt (Figure 5). FC1, FC3 and FC5 were then coupled to
the surface of Biacore chip, using a biotin-streptavidin attach-
ment method, and enzyme binding monitored using SPR. We
estimate that the 14 atom-linked-biotin tether, plus the length
of the attached oligonucleotide (>22 bp), would place the
30 end bound by the enzyme at least 75 s from the strepta-
vidin surface. Assuming vaccinia polymerase exhibits dimen-
sions similar to a protein like RB69 DNA polymerase [where
the polymerase active site is located 30 s from the
protein’s edge, measured along the DNA (20)], this distance
should well exceed that needed to avoid any steric interfer-
ence between enzyme and chip surface.
The SPR method clearly showed that vaccinia DNA poly-
merase has a binding preference most favoring duplex ends
and least favoring molecules resembling the typical products
of strand joining reactions (i.e. FC1 > FC3 > FC5). Where
others have used similar substrates (e.g. a blunt-ended duplex
molecule like FC1), but different enzymes, there is still
surprisingly good agreement between measured dissociation
constants. We measured a KD for vaccinia polymerase of
7.0 ± 0.7 nM using FC1 (95% confidence interval ¼ 5.6–
8.4 nM), versus 13 nM reported for human DNA polymerase
b using SPR methods and a similar DNA (21). Using
stopped-flow methods Otto et al. (22) measured a KD
for T4 DNA polymerase of 21 nM. One notable difference
between these studies is that stopped-flow methods detect
on-off rates for T4 DNA polymerase that are so fast (koff ¼
9.3 s1) as to suggest that DNA polymerase binding and dis-
sociation rates should not be readily measurable using SPR
methods. This fact is consistent with our observations
(Figure 7), but is not consistent with what has been reported
for earlier SPR measurements utilizing DNA polymerase
b. These authors reported a koff¼ 0.0099 s1 for duplex
DNA substrates. The origin of this discrepancy in reaction
rates is difficult to identify, given the many differences in
experimental protocols and the different enzymes used. In
particular there are significant differences in buffer composi-
tion and reaction temperatures. However, we note that in this
earlier SPR study the authors also coupled up to 50-fold more
DNA to the chip surface than we did [50–100 RU versus
2500 RU (21)], and this high substrate density might have
had a negative effect on reaction rates while not ultimately
affecting KD values. Regardless of the cause of this discrep-
ancy, the fact that these KD measurements all cluster between
7 and 21 nM provides some confidence that these methods all
measure values close to true KDs. This is actually quite
remarkable given the necessity of making several methodolo-
gical assumptions (including the assumption that all the
enzyme is active in these preparations) and the different tech-
niques and enzymes used to calculate dissociation constants.
When the relative binding preferences we have measured
are considered within the context of how the enzyme processes
homologous DNAs (Figures 3 and 4), it becomes apparent how
this enzyme can promote duplex joining reactions in vitro.
Vaccinia DNA polymerase has a clear preference for binding
duplex ends, which are then processed by 30–50 exonuclease
into a pool of 30-gapped molecules. This reaction proceeds
even in the presence of dNTPs and may reflect some funda-
mental difference in the way DNA partitions between exo-
nuclease and polymerase active sites in poxvirus enzymes.
If these gaps span complementary sequences, and are long
enough to create stable heteroduplex molecules, then these
DNAs can anneal spontaneously to form joint molecules.
The 30 ends that are subsumed within the resulting typical
hybrid structures are 4-fold less-favored enzyme binding
sites, compared with blunt ends, and thus this combination of
reaction and binding properties will favor the production of
metastable joint molecules. In contrast, the proofreading exonu-
cleases of other DNA polymerases have only a limited appetite
Figure 8. Production and repair of double-strand breaks formed during
poxvirus DNA replication. The Moyer–Graves model proposes that
replication starts near a hairpin telomere and the polymerase then copies
the genome in the manner shown at the top of the figure. If this replicating
complex were to collide with a nick in the template strand, in a manner best
understood in the context of bacterial systems (24), it would break the DNA.
Such breaks could be repaired using the method shown. Black dots indicate
50 ended strands and thicker lines are newly synthesized DNA.

for properly duplex (as distinct from mismatched) DNA ends
in the presence of dNTPs, and thus under our reaction condi-
tions most other polymerases would not generate the gapped
molecules from which recombinant duplexes are formed.
These same reaction features are also likely operative
in vivo, including a relative preference for binding and exonu-
clease processing of duplex ends by the polymerase. How-
ever, these reactions would be affected by the activities of
other viral replication factors, single-strand binding proteins,
and changing dNTP pools. These effects would be difficult to
predict a priori. It is clear that the exonuclease (12) and
strand joining (Figure 1) activities are both modulated by
dNTP concentration in vitro and so this could be a key factor
regulating recombination in vivo. Unfortunately we do not
understand how dNTP concentrations change temporally
and spatially during infection and thus cannot predict exactly
what effect these will have on virus recombination in vivo. It
is also unclear what proportion of the E9 protein is incorpo-
rated into the processive form (16,23) of enzyme complex, by
complexing with the A20 and D4 proteins, nor is it certain if
this fraction remains stable over time. Nevertheless we would
note that even when incorporated into a replication complex,
there is no reason to believe the exonuclease would be ren-
dered inactive by A20 or D4. The activity is needed for proof-
reading and it could also serve an essential purpose in
facilitating the repair of broken replication forks (24). One
of the difficulties posed by the Moyer–Graves rolling hairpin
model for poxvirus replication (25) is that collision of a rep-
lication complex with a nick in the template strand would cre-
ate double-strand breaks in the virus DNA (Figure 8). We
have shown that molecules bearing 50-overhangs next to the
region of homology [albeit only small ones have been tested
(10)] are still substrates for duplex-by-duplex joining reac-
tions. Consequently, these breaks could be repaired by a
stalled replication complex using a SSA reaction coupled
with nick ligation. We are currently devising efficient ways
of isolating poxvirus replication complexes to test this
proposal.
