Introduction
Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is a multipurpose crop
(food, feed, fodder and fuel) that has potential as an
alternative raw material for ethanol production owing to
its high biomass production, high Brix (%), short
duration and low water requirement (4,000 cubic m ha-1)
and wider adaptability (Reddy et al. 2005). In addition,
sweet sorghum is a seed propagated species and better
suited for mechanized crop production. The other
significant advantage is that the sweet sorghum ethanol
blended gasohol is environment friendly. It does not have
sulfur and aldehydes making it a green fuel.
The environment and cost considerations and the need
for alternative raw material for production of ethanol to
meet increased demand has triggered interest in the
utilization of sweet sorghum for ethanol production in
India and several other countries like the Philippines,
Thailand and China. The cost of cultivation of sweet
sorghum is about one-third that of sugarcane (Saccharum
officinarum) (Dayakar Rao et al. 2004). Further, sweet
sorghum is best suited for ethanol production because of
its higher reducing sugar content compared to sugarcane
(Huilgol et al. 2004). Policies to blend petrol with up to
10% ethanol has been widely adopted globally, leading to
additional ethanol requirement.
Continuous supply of feed stock to the industries is
one major constraint in sweet sorghum ethanol production.
To encourage the distilleries to make sweet sorghum a
major raw material in addition to sugarcane molasses in
ethanol production, there is an urgent need to arrange for
the supply of sweet sorghum stalks to the distilleries all-
round the year. The current study was undertaken in order
to study the feasibility of growing sweet sorghum throughout
the year.
Materials and methods
The material for the present study consisted of 7 hybrids
(ICSA 264 × SSV 74, ICSA 293 × SSV 74, ICSA 293 ×
SSV 84, ICSA 293 × SPV 1411, ICSA 474 × SPV 1411,
ICSA 474 × ICSV 700, ICSA 529 × SPV 1411) and 3
varieties (SPV 1411, SSV 74 and SSV 84) of sweet
sorghum. Each entry was planted six times at monthly
intervals during July to December 2005 in two rows of 4
m length with a spacing of 75 cm between rows and 10
cm between plants within a row in Vertisols of the
International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, India. The experiment
was laid out in a randomized complete block design with
three replications. All the recommended agronomic
practices were followed to raise a healthy crop.
Observations were recorded on eight randomly selected
plants in each entry and in each replication for time to
50% flowering, plant height, fresh stalk yield, cane yield,
juice yield, juice volume, Brix, stillage yield and grain
yield.
Results and discussion
Highly significant differences (P <0.01) were observed
among the genotypes and the sowing time for all the traits
(Table 1). The interaction effects of sowing time with
genotypes were also highly significant.
For sugar yield (calculated as a product of Brix (%)
and juice yield) that correlates with the ethanol yield, July
and August sowings (which were similar though the
August sowing was numerically superior) were significantly
superior to the subsequent sowings in September to
December. However for Brix, July, August, September
and November sowings were similar, while October
sowing had significantly lower and December sowing
had significantly higher Brix (Table 2). When hybrids
and varieties were observed as two separate groups,
varieties performed better than hybrids for sugar yield
(this may not be the case always as the hybrids used in the
study were in the preliminary stages of testing). However,
variability across different dates was greater in varieties
(GCV = 62.92) compared to hybrids (GCV = 28.13) (Table
3). This indicates that hybrids have better buffering
capacity to environmental fluctuations compared to varieties.
This study gives an indication that hybrids are more
suitable for fuel alcohol production compared to varieties
owing to their stability in expression over different
