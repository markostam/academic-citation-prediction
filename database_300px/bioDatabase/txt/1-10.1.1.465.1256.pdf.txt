ABSTRACT
Peiffer, JJ, Abbiss, CR, Chapman, D, Laursen, PB, and Parker,
DL. Physiological characteristics of masters-level cyclists.
J Strength Cond Res 22(5): 1434–1440, 2008—Although a
considerable amount of research is available describing the
physiological characteristics of competitive young-adult cyclists,
research describing these same characteristics in Masters-level
cyclists is rare. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
describe and compare the effect of aging on physiological
fitness parameters of Masters-level cyclists in an attempt to
provide normative fitness data. Thirty-two male cyclists (35–73
years) completed one 15-minute economy test and one graded
exercise test (GXT) on a cycle ergometer. During the GXT,
maximal oxygen uptake ( _VO2max), maximal heart rate (HRmax),
the first (VT1) and second (VT2) ventilatory thresholds, and peak
power output (PPO) were recorded. For the purpose of analysis,
subjects were allocated into three age groups (35–45 years,
45–54 years, $55 years). Maximal oxygen uptake and absolute
PPO were significantly lower among subjects 55 years and older
(45.96 4.6 mLkg21min21 and 3246 51 W, respectively) com-
pared with the 45- to 54-year group (54.26 6.6 mLkg21min21
and 3926 36 W, respectively), and both were significantly less
compared with the 35- to 44-year group (60.7 6 5.1
mLkg21min21 and 434 6 32 W, respectively). Maximal heart
rate was significantly greater in both the 35- to 44-year and
45- to 54-year age groups compared with the $55-year group.
The first ventilatory threshold was significantly greater in the
subjects who were 55 years and older group compared with the
35- to 44-year and 45- to 54-year age groups, and VT2 was
significantly greater in subjects 55 years and older compared
with the 35- to 44-year group. Economy was not different
amongst groups. In conclusion, increases in age resulted in
a significant reduction in fitness parameters across age groups.
The comparison of the fitness characteristics of Masters-level
cyclists with established young-adult cyclist data should be
avoided, because this may lead to inaccurate assessments of
fitness.

INTRODUCTION
T
he Baby Boom years (1946–1964) resulted in an
exponential increase in the world population, with
approximately 76 million births in the United
States alone. Today, the age of the Baby Boom
generation is 40–60 years old and represents one quarter of
the population in the United States. Therefore, ‘‘Masters-
level’’ athletes (.35 years) represent a large fraction of today’s
recreational sporting population. Currently, the majority of
research on Masters-aged individuals examines disease
control (i.e., diabetes, heart diseases) aimed at improving
the functional quality of life (21,22). Indeed, this research
provides interesting insight into physiological changes that
occur with aging. For example, research has shown that
beyond 40 years of age, maximal oxygen uptake ( _VO2max)
(19), heart rate maximum (16), and neuromuscular function
(7) significantly decline in a progressive manner. It has also
been suggested that an increase in the number of competitive
years of sport participation can attenuate the decline in
aerobic fitness normally associated with aging (20). As such,
studies on Masters athletes present interesting insight into
the fitness levels that can be achieved through continued
participation in competitive sport (20,23,24). However, most
Masters-level research completed to date has focused on
competitive runners, leaving a void in the research of
Masters-level cyclists.
Physiological indices such as _VO2max (4), peak power out-
put (PPO) (8), metabolic thresholds (1), and economy of
motion (14) can be used to identify the training status of
an athlete and predict cycling performance. Routinely,
cyclists are classified by exercise scientists as being either
untrained, trained, or elite on the basis of established maximal
exercise test normative data (11). Unfortunately, physiolog-
ical changes associated with aging may complicate the

comparison of Masters cyclists’ data with already-established
normative data. It is necessary to acknowledge the influence
of age on fitness, and although it is possible that some
variables (i.e., PPO, economy, ventilatory thresholds) may be
similar between younger and older competitive cyclists (20),
it should not be assumed that all variables will be similar.
Indeed, doing so could result in the inappropriate categoriza-
tion of these athletes. A comprehensive physiological profile of
Masters cyclists would aid exercise scientists in their ability to
properly categorize these athletes. Furthermore, such data
would provide interesting insight into which physiological
indices among Masters-level cyclists are most influenced by age.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was twofold. We first
sought to establish a physiological profile for Masters-level
cyclists between the ages of 35 and 75 years. Second, we
aimed to provide individual physiological profiles throughout
different decades of the Masters-level cyclist (35–44 years, 45–
54 years, and $55 years). We hypothesized that the phy-
siological profile of Masters-level cyclists would not be similar
to that of the young-adult population norms. Additionally, we
hypothesized that an increase in competitive years of racing
would attenuate the decline in aerobic capacity that has been
previously highlighted in noncompetitive aging adults.
METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem
This study examined physiological data recorded during
a maximal graded exercise test (GXT) on a cycle ergometer
for 32 Masters-level cyclists. Specifically, _VO2max, PPO,
maximal heart rate (HRmax), and the first and second
ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2) were analyzed because
these variable have previously been shown, in a normal
population, to be influenced by aging. Comparisons were
made between decades (35–44 years, 45–54 years, and $55
years) to evaluate age-related changes within the 32 Masters-
level cyclists, and additional comparisons were made to
preexisting normative data established from a younger cohort
of cyclists.
Subjects
Thirty-two Masters-level male
cyclists (Table 1) volunteered
to participate in this study. All
subjects were recruited from
Western Australia cycling clubs
(Cat. A–C; U.S. equivalent, Cat.
1–3) and were actively partici-
pating in cycle racing at the
time of testing. All testing was
conducted during the road-
race season (February to April),
with a majority of races con-
ducted for an average distance
of 70–120 km. At the time of
testing, subjects reported to be
regularly participating in cycle training (Table 2), with no
other training (i.e., weight lifting, running) reported during
this time. Subjects were given written and verbal instructions
regarding the study procedures and the possible risks and
benefits resulting from their participation in the study.
Written informed consent was obtained before the study,
which was approved by the Edith Cowan University human
research ethics committee. Subjects were required to refrain
from intense physical activity the day before and the day of
all physical testing.
Procedures
Subjects were required to complete a 15-minute submaximal
economy test (15EC) and a maximal GXTon a Veltron cycle
ergometer (RacerMate, Seattle, Wash). Before the 15EC and
GXT, the Velotron cycle ergometer was adjusted (i.e., seat
height, handlebar height, top tube length) to mimic each
subject’s own personal bicycle, and subjects were fitted with
a telemetry heart-rate–monitoring system (Polar 810i,
Kempele, Finland). During both tests, respiratory data were
collected as 15-second averages via a Parvo Medics metabolic
cart (Parvo Medics, Sandy, Utah). The gas analyzers were
calibrated before each subject’s trial using gases of known
concentration (16% O2, 4% CO2), and the pneumotach was
calibrated using a 3-L syringe (Hans Rudolph, series 5530;
Kansas City, Mo) throughout a range of flow rates.
During the 15EC, subjects were required to ride at three
separate intensities (100, 150, 200 W) in sequential order at
5-minute intervals. Data from the 200-W intensity were used
for analysis, because this intensity has previously been used
to assess economy in trained cyclists (17). Subjects were
instructed to maintain their preferred cycling cadence
throughout the duration of the test. The average volume
of oxygen consumption ( _VO2) recorded during the final 2
minutes of the 200-W stage was determined, and economy
was then calculated as follows:
Economy ¼ W = _V o2

where W is the workload for each stage (W) and _VO2 is the
average volume of oxygen consumed in liters per minute.
After the 15EC, subjects were given 15 minutes of passive
recovery before beginning the GXT. The GXTcommenced at
an intensity of 70 W and increased by 35 Wmin21, during
which the subjects were again instructed to pedal at a cadence
reflective of their normal road riding. The test was terminated
when subjects were no longer able to maintain a cadence of
at least 60 rpm. During the GXT, _VO2max, PPO, HRmax,
VT1, and VT2 were recorded. _VO2max was defined as
a change in _VO2 of no greater than 2 mLkg21min21 with
three successive stages, RER greater than 1.1, and heart rate
greater than 85% of age-predicted max. PPO was calculated
as the power output corresponding to the highest stage
completed, including the fractional representation of any
uncompleted stage as followed:
PPO ¼ Pcs þ ððT c=60Þ3 35W Þ
where Pcs is the power output
corresponding to the last com-
pleted stage, and Tc is the time
in seconds of the uncompleted
stage.
To determine VT1 and VT2,
the ventilatory equivalents
( _VE/ _VO2 and _VE/ _VCO2) for
each subject were plotted over
the corresponding _VO2 values.
VT1 was defined as a sudden rise
in _VE/ _VO2 while _VE/ _VCO2
remained at a plateau, otherwise
known as the isocapnic buffering
point. VT2 was determined as the point where both _VE/ _VO2
and _VE/ _VCO2 displayed an exponential increase (15). Ventila-
tory threshold graphs (Figure 1) were assessed for
VT1 and VT2 by two independent reviewers; a third
reviewer was used in cases where discrepancies in threshold
placement occurred.
Statistical Analyses
Maximal oxygen uptake, PPO, HRmax, VT1, VT2, and
economy were compared between age groups (35–44 years,
45–54 years,$55 years), using a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). If the ANOVA indicated a difference between
conditions, a Tukey honestly significant differences post hoc
test was used to determine the point of interaction. Data were
analyzed using Statistica for Windows, with the level of
significance set at 0.05. Normative percentiles were de-
termined using the percentile function within Microsoft
Excel. Data are presented as means 6 standard deviations.
RESULTS
Values for all variables of in-
terest measured during the
15EC and GXT are presented
in Table 3. Absolute _VO2max
(Lmin21) and PPO (W) were
shown to significantly decline
with increases in age group.
Moreover, a significantly lower
relative _VO2max (mlkg21min21)
and PPO (Wkg21) were ob-
served in the subjects who were
55 years and older compared
with the 35- to 44-year age
group and the 45- to 54-year
age group. Compared with the
$55-year age group, HRmax
was significantly greater in both
the 35- to 44-year and 45- to
54-year age groups; however,
no differences were observed
between the 35- to 44-year and

group, VT1 expressed as a percentage of _VO2max was sig-
nificantly lower in the 35- to 44-year and 45- to 54-year age
groups, and VT2 was significantly greater in the$55-year age
group compared with the 35- to 44-year age group. No
difference in economy was observed between any age group.
Table 2 shows a listing of percentiles (10–90%) for the GXT
variables in each age group.
DISCUSSION
The aims of this study were to determine the effects of aging
on _VO2max, PPO, HRmax, VT1, VT2, and economy in a
group of Masters (.35 years)-level cyclists and to determine
whether Masters-level cycling data can be accurately assessed
using established young-adult normative cycling data. The
interesting findings from this study are that 1) _VO2max, PPO,
and HRmax significantly declined with increases in age, 2) an
increase in VT1 was observed with increases in age, and 3)
economy was found to be similar between the various age
groups tested in this study.
Unlike other studies that have used a case study approach
(5), to the authors’ knowledge this study is the first to provide
a detailed assessment of the physiological characteristics of
Masters-level cyclists. Decreases in aerobic capacity of approx-
imately 10% per decade have been reported for trained as
well as untrained individuals (19,24). However, Pollock et al.
(20) have shown that Masters runners (50–82 years) who
continued to compete for a 10-year time period did not
experience declines in _VO2max to levels observed in their
noncompetitive counterparts. In the present study, absolute
and relative _VO2max declined by approximately 10% between
the 35- to 44-year age group compared with the 45- to 54-
year age group. Additionally, this decline continued a further
16% between the 45- to 54-year and $ 55-year age groups
(Table 3). Interestingly, our subjects were all engaged in
a high level of training (Table 2), and personal com-
munication with the subjects indicated that most had been
cycling for more than 10 years. This observation suggests that
continued participation in competitive cycling does not
necessarily attenuate the age-related decreases in aerobic
fitness that have been described previously. One possible
explanation for the decline in _VO2max is the lower HRmax
observed in our older subjects (Table 3). Heart rate has been
shown to be a limiting factor to _VO2max (25), and an age-
related decrease in heart rate has been shown to occur in
trained and untrained individuals (23).
Interestingly, declining _VO2max values were in contrast to
an observed increase in VT1. VT1 is noninvasive indicator of
lactate threshold. In comparison, Coggan et al. (3) observed
an age-related increase in lactate threshold in older runners,
possibly attributable to increases in oxidative enzymes
(succinate dehydrogenase and b-hydroxyacyl-CoA) and
a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase found to exist in the
older runners. This finding may help explain why Masters-

level cyclists are still competitive with younger cyclists, even
in the face of decreasing aerobic capacity.
Similar to the decline in _VO2max, PPO was also found to be
significantly different between the various age groups tested
in this study. In the present study, it was found that absolute
and relative PPO was 9% lower in the 45- to 54-year age
group, compared with the 35- to 44-year age group, with
a further 14% average decrease in the $55-year age group
compared with cyclists ages 45–54 years (Table 1). Such
a decrease in PPO is an interesting finding because PPO has
previously been found to be highly correlated with overall
cycling performance (2,8). Therefore, because Masters-level
cyclists often compete as a single age group (35 years), such
findings may indicate possible disadvantages for older riders.
The ability to generate power during cycling is highly
dependent on the muscular strength of the cyclist. Conse-
quently, it is possible that the dramatic differences in maximal
power output observed may be related to reductions in the
ability of older athletes to produce force. An increase in age
from 45 to 80 years has been shown to result in a 15–29%
decline in absolute lower-body muscular strength (6),
possibly because of reductions in muscle mass. Indeed,
Lexell et al. (13) have shown a 40% reduction in muscle
cross-sectional area between the ages of 20 and 80 years, with
30% of that reduction occurring after the age of 50 years (23).
Although research has shown resistance training to reverse
the loss in muscle mass (23), few cyclists engage in such
practices, because many cyclists believe that additional body-
weight gains from strength training will decrease cycling
performance. Despite this, there is a paucity of research exam-
ining the influence of resistance training on cycling perfor-
mance in Masters-level cyclists (10). It is possible that by
incorporating resistance training, Masters-level cyclists may
be able to attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength,
consequently maintaining performance with aging (12).
Models of cycling performance indicate that the economy
of motion makes an important contribution to overall cycling
performance (18). It has been shown that an inverse rela-
tionship exists between aerobic fitness and economy (9,14),
where those with lower levels of aerobic fitness have a com-
pensatory increase in economy of motion. Further, it has been
suggested that the inverse relationship may be attributable to
an increase in the percentage of more efficient Type I fibers in
exercised muscle (9). The loss of muscle mass associated with
aging is primarily attributable to a reduction in Type II fibers
(16) resulting in a greater percentage of Type I fibers. This
latter finding might be thought to contribute to a higher
economy of motion in older compared with younger cyclists.
However, results of this study do not support this theory,
because similar levels of economy were observed between all
age groups (Table 3). Unfortunately, in the present study,
muscle fiber type was not determined, and, therefore, it is not
known whether similar fiber types existed between age groups.
The physiological categorization of cyclists provides a tool
to predict exercise performance, create appropriate training
protocols, aid in the identification of talent, and distinguish
groups of cyclists within a given population. On the basis of
previous guidelines (Table 5), the physiological characteristics
of all subjects in the present study would suggest that this
sample pool generally consists of ‘‘trained cyclists’’ (11). How-
ever, when individual age groups are examined, only the
35- to 44-year age group could be classified as ‘‘trained,’’
whereas the lower aerobic capacity and PPO that were
observed in our older cyclists ($ 55 years) would have
resulted in these cyclists being classified as ‘‘untrained.’’ This
categorization would have occurred despite that fact that the
training load of this group of cyclists would be considered
‘‘elite.’’ Additionally, three of the subjects who were 55 years
and older had qualified and were scheduled to compete in the
World Masters Road Cycling Championships later that year.

This discrepancy highlights the inaccuracy of comparing
data from competitive Masters-level cyclists with data
derived from younger cyclists. The authors recognize that
the small sample sizes (n = 14, n = 11, n = 8) do not provide
the statistical power to label our data ‘‘normative.’’ However,
it should also be noted that the normative data that are
commonly used to describe cyclists are based on a small
sample size (11). Therefore, it is our intention to provide the
information in Tables 3 and 4 as a current guide to assess
the physical fitness level of Masters-level cyclists. Further
research using a larger sample size is needed to provide
an overall representation and true normative data for the
Masters-level cyclist.
In summary, whereas Masters-level cyclists were shown
to possess relatively high levels of aerobic capacity, a decrease
in physical fitness parameters was shown with increases
in age. The decrease in aerobic capacity (;10% per decade)
was consistent with previous literature and may be related
to the decrease in HRmax. Further, economy of motion
was not found to be significantly different between the age
groups tested in this study, despite a progressive reduction
in PPO. Although Masters-level cyclists may present with
a high degree of physical fitness compared with a normal
population, the present study has shown that normative
data established from younger cyclists should not be used to
categorize the fitness levels of Masters-level cyclists.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
Maximal GXT data provide an effective way to predict
performance, determine training intensities, and categorize
cyclists. However, continued competitive cycling does not
attenuate the declines in aerobic fitness and muscular power
associated with aging. Masters-level cyclists can be highly
competitive, but the comparison of physiological indices from
Masters-level cyclists with normative data established from
younger cyclists can lead to a misinterpretation of the data
and subsequent inaccuracies in predicting performance,
determining training intensities, and categorization of
Masters-level cyclists. Therefore, it is important for coaches,
athletes, and exercise scientists to use age-appropriate data
when comparing cyclists between age groups.
