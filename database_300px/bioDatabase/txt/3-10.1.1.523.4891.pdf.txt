ABSTRACT
Four-stranded DNA and RNA quadruplexes or G4
motifs are non-B DNA conformations that are
presumed to form in vivo, although only few
explicit evidence has been reported. Using bio-
informatics the presence of putative DNA
G-quadruplexes within critical promoter regions
has been demonstrated and a regulatory role in
transcription has been suspected. However, in
genomic DNA the presence of the complementary
strand interferes with the potential to form a
quadruplex motif. Contrarily RNA G4 motifs have
no such limitation and consequently strong inter-
ference with gene expression is suspected.
Nevertheless, experimental evidence is scarce.
Here we show a well-defined structure–function
relationship of synthetic quadruplex sequences in
50-UTRs in multiple mammalian cell-lines. We
establish a universal ‘translational suppressor’
effect of these motifs on gene expression at the
translational level and show for the first time that
specific features such as loop-length and the num-
ber of ‘GGG’-repeats further determine the suppres-
sive impact. Moreover, a consistent and predictable
repression of gene expression is observed for
naturally occurring RNA G4 motifs, augmenting the
functional relevance of these unusual nucleic acid
structures.
INTRODUCTION
DNA and RNA sequences with a minimum four
interspersed ‘GGG’ repeats can potentially fold back to
form stable G-quadruplex (G4) motifs, a four-stranded
conformation composed of stacked guanine tetrads inter-
acting via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds which is further
stabilized by chelating monovalent metal ions such
as sodium or potassium (1,2). Initial computational
searches identiﬁed putative sequences which can form
G4 motifs throughout the genome in various mammalian
(3–5) and bacterial (6) species. More rigorous analyses of
the human genome suggested a statistically signiﬁcant
enrichment in gene promoters (7,8) and untranslated
regions (UTRs) (9). Based on these ﬁndings, regulatory
functions of DNA quadruplexes have been suggested in
gene expression (10,11) and genomic maintenance (12–14).
Although in genetic mechanisms such as replication,
recombination (15), and transcription transient single-
stranded DNA is observed, the presence of the comple-
mentary strand should disfavor quadruplex formation
(16,17). Interestingly the single-stranded guanine-rich
telomeric overhang, which has no duplex competition
against structure formation, has been shown to form a
quadruplex motif under in vitro conditions, while the
in vivo existence is still controversial (18). The telomeric
repeat has been studied in great detail with respect to its
potential to form quadruplex structures (1,2). The mam-
malian telomeric overhang ﬂips over and invades the
telomeric duplex sequence generating an unique confor-
mation called ‘t-loop’ (19). An increasing number of
proteins have been identiﬁed that speciﬁcally interact
with DNA quadruplexes, resulting in enhanced or
disrupted formation of quadruplex motifs (20–28). Since
the induction of quadruplexes seems to interfere with
telomere length maintenance and hence with the
replicative life-span, various classes of small molecules tar-
geting genomic quadruplexes have been developed, dis-
playing anti-proliferative activities due to inhibition of
proto-oncogene expression (29) and telomerase activity
(30). In contrast, very little is known about the properties
and inﬂuence of RNA quadruplex formation in vivo. The
formation of four-stranded RNA structures is well estab-
lished in vitro, demonstrating that G-rich RNAs form
quadruplexes with stabilities equal to their DNA
counterparts (31–33). Computational searches for poten-
tial RNA quadruplexes in human mRNAs have identiﬁed
a prevalence in 50-UTRs (9), but only little experimental
evidence concerning its eﬀect on gene expression is avail-
able. Two recent studies demonstrate a suppressive inﬂu-
ence of individual RNA quadruplexes found in the NRAS
(34) and ZIC-1 (35) 50-UTRs. We recently demonstrated

a pronounced eﬀect of artiﬁcially introduced quadruplexes
on gene expression in bacterial mRNAs (31), however,
an extensive study of the impact of RNA quadruplexes
in mammalian mRNAs is lacking. In addition to
characterizing naturally occurring sequence motifs
(34,35), the use of artiﬁcial sequences allows for studying
how distinct quadruplex features such as loop com-
positions and the number of G-rich repeats contribute to
the suppressive eﬀects of these unusual nucleic acid
structures on gene expression (31). Here we systematically
characterize the inﬂuence of synthetic and natural
quadruplex-forming sequences on gene expression in
several mammalian cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Circular dichroism spectroscopy
All samples were prepared at 5 mM strand concentration
(metabion Gmbh, HPLC puriﬁed) in RNase free 10mM
Tris–Cl, pH 7.4, 10mM KCl, except Figure S3 (1mM
KCl). Samples were heated to 95C for 5mins and slowly
cooled overnight before scanning in a 1ml capped-
cuvette at 15C using Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter
(Jasco Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan) ﬁtted with a Peltier tem-
perature controller. Circular dichroism (CD) scans were
recorded in pentaplets at 50 nmmin–1 with a 2 s response
time, 1 nm pitch and 1 nm bandwidth, averaged, buﬀer
subtracted and zero-corrected at 320 nm. For Tm calcula-
tion, samples were annealed from 95 to 15C and melted
back, at a controlled rate of 1C min1.
Construction of plasmids
The G-quadruplex sequences (Tables 1 and 2) were
introduced into the psiCHECK-2 (Promega, Supplemen-
tary Figure 1) by whole plasmid PCR with primers
having G-rich 50-overhangs (Supplementary Figure 5)
using the sequences shown in Supplementary Table 1.
A detailed protocol for generating the quadruplex
insertions can be found in ref. (36).
Natural 50-UTR quadruplex sequences
Human genome 50-UTR sequences (25 193; one FASTA
record per refgene) were downloaded from UCSC
table browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables)
as on May 2008. We could retrieve 2013 putative
RNA G-quadruplex forming sequences using customized
algorithm (6), which is in good accordance with 2334
quadruplex reported using diﬀerent algorithm and
50-UTR sequence retrieval option recently (9). We then
manually searched for distinct multiple ‘GGG’-repeat
sequences and the 4MAPK2, 5CHST2 and 6PCGF2
quadruplex sequences were arbitrarily chosen.
Cell culture and dual luciferase assay
Cells were grown to 50% conﬂuency in ﬂat-bottomed
96-well plate under standard conditions of 37C, 5%
CO2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagles medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(FCS), 2mM glutamine, non-essential amino acids
and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin, before
transient transfection with 50 ng of plasmid constructs
(Tables 1 and 2) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
or Turbofect (Fermentas), according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours post-transfection,
cells were retrieved and processed using Dual-luciferase
Reporter Assay kit (E1910, Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The luciferase activity was
determined using a TECAN M200 reader.
Quantitative real-time PCR assay
HEK293 cells were grown to 50% conﬂuency in ﬂat-
bottomed 6-well plate, under conditions stated above
and transfected with Turbofect (Fermentas), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours later,
the total cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus
Mini Kit (74134, Qiagen). For quantiﬁcation of mRNA
levels, 1 mg of total RNA was used in a 25 ml reaction using
Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (11888382001, Roche)
and SYBR-green (kindly provided by the Marx group,
University of Konstanz) on a Chromo4 Real-Time
Detector (Biorad) using primer pairs 50-CCAACCCTGT
TCAGCTTCTTC-30 and 50-ACCTTGGCCTCGAAGAA
TGG-30 for hluc mRNA and 50-TGATCGAGTCCTGGG
ACGA-30 and 50-ACAATCTGGACGACGTCGGG-30
for hRluc mRNA. All reactions were done in triplicate.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In order to investigate the impact of quadruplex forma-
tion on gene expression, we chose to introduce artiﬁcially
designed G4 motif sequences into a reporter gene setup
(Figures 1A and Supplementary Figure 1). The use of
such non-natural sequences allows for studying the eﬀect
of stability-determining features, circumventing the
sequence restrictions that apply when using natural
motifs. Since the thermodynamic stability of G4 motifs
is known to depend on the loop lengths, we ﬁrst tested
the inﬂuence of quadruplexes containing one- (4G3U),
two- (4G3U2), or three- (4G3U3) nucleotide loops (Table
1), inserted eleven nucleotides upstream of the start codon
(corresponding to +124 bp with respect to the 50-end of
the mRNA, for a detailed description of the construct see
also Supplementary Table 1) of a luciferase reporter. For
DNA quadruplexes, the thermodynamic stability increases
with decreasing loop lengths, with mononucleotide loops
exhibiting the highest stabilities (37,38). We found that the
expression of the Renilla reporter luciferase in HEK293
cells decreased to residual 36, 56 and 73%, respec-
tively, compared to the parental reporter construct
(Figure 1B). To conﬁrm that perturbation of gene expres-
sion is solely based on quadruplex structure formation and
not due to the mere insertion of the additional G-rich
sequence, we investigated a control sequence for each
quadruplex studied. For this purpose, we constructed
similar G/U-rich control sequences (Table 1) which are
unable to form a quadruplex by disrupting the middle
tetrads by G to U mutations. Importantly, the expression
was restored in all three control sequences (Figure 1B).
In addition, we inserted a control sequence containing

only three ‘GGG’-repeats (3G3U, Table 1) which by itself
is not able to form an intramolecular quadruplex, but
could potentially participate in an intermolecular RNA
quadruplex. We found no inﬂuence on expression for
the construct 3G3U compared to wt-hRluc or the other
G/U-rich control sequences (Figure 1B) and hence we
conclude that the changes in expression are imminently
due to intramolecular RNA quadruplex formation.
In order to comprehend the expression diﬀerences
observed for the diﬀerent loop sizes, we decided to
structurally and thermodynamically characterize the
investigated RNA sequences using CD spectroscopy.
For DNA quadruplexes it has been established that the
thermodynamic stability is inversely proportional to loop
sizes (37,38). For RNA quadruplexes there are only few
data available (31), hence we investigated the stability of
the quadruplexes 4G3U3, 4G3U2 and 4G3U. We found
that the inserted RNA sequences form parallel-stranded
quadruplexes (Figure 2A–C) displaying gradually
increasing stability with decreasing loop length from
4G3U3 to 4G3U (Figure 2D). The latter ﬁnding conﬁrms
previous data demonstrating a higher stability of RNA
quadruplexes with decreasing loop sizes, behaving simi-
larly to DNA quadruplexes (31). We have also carried
out CD spectroscopy with the control RNA sequences
that should be unable to adopt quadruplexes. We found
no structure formation (Figure 2A–C) which agrees with
the absence of eﬀects on gene expression as discussed
above. In conclusion, a direct correlation of the
quadruplex stability with its inﬂuence on gene expression
has been demonstrated in mammalian 50-UTRs.
Next, we investigated at which level of gene expression
the quadruplex formation takes eﬀect. For this purpose,
we quantiﬁed mRNA-levels by real time PCR in
order to clarify whether the insertion of the G-rich
sequences interfered with mRNA abundance by reducing
transcriptional eﬃciency or mRNA stability. Identical
mRNA levels were detected for all tested expression
constructs (Figure 2E) in accordance to the results
reported recently for the ZIC-1 quadruplex, pointing at
a mechanism acting at the level of translational initiation
(35). This result is also supported by a report of
quadruplex formation in the FMR1 mRNA resulting in
stalled 40S ribosomal subunits (39,40). Additional
experiments are necessary to decipher the exact mecha-
nism of quadruplex interference with translation.
Although four interspersed ‘GGG’-repeats are the
minimal requirement to form a G4 motif, naturally
occurring G4 motifs often contain ﬁve, six or even more
‘GGG’-repeats (1). In order to investigate the inﬂuence of
the number of ‘GGG’-repeats we examined additional
series of 50-UTR luciferase constructs (Table 1, 5G3UX
and 6G3UX). Interestingly, we found that gene expression
further decreased consecutively from four to six ‘GGG’-
repeat runs consistently in each loop-length series

(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 2), with 6G3UX
being more repressive than the ﬁve- and four-repeat
series, respectively. The most potent suppressor sequence
6G3U reduced expression by 85%. Importantly, the
control sequences containing G to U mutations as well
restored gene expression in the 5- and 6-repeat series,
with the clone con6G3U3 showing an unanticipated high
expression. In order to investigate whether this unexpected
eﬀect of increasing the ‘GGG’ repeat number resulting in
even more pronounced suppression, we carried out addi-
tional CD melting studies. Surprisingly, we found 5G3U
and 6G3U RNA-quadruplex motifs are thermodynami-
cally more stable than its shorter companion, the 4G3U
motif (Supplementary Figure 3). This observation is sur-
prising as only one G4 motif with a similar conformation
is possible even with ﬁve or six ‘GGG’ repeats present and
hence is expected to have a similar thermodynamic stabil-
ity. Although the CD spectra are very similar to the 4G3U
sequence, pointing at an all-parallel RNA quadruplex
(Supplementary Figure 3), additional structural stabiliza-
tion of the four-stranded structure by the additional
‘GGG’ repeats cannot be ruled out. In light of this
ﬁnding, it is tempting to speculate that this could be a
possible reason why many naturally occurring biologically
relevant DNA [c-myc, bcl-2, VEGF, HIF-1a) (2) and RNA
(Zic-1 (35), 5CHST2, and 6PCGF2, see below] quadruplex
sequences contain more than four ‘GGG’-repeat runs.
Since Balasubramanian and co-workers have recently
shown that pronounced quadruplex-based repression
was evidenced only when the quadruplex motif was
located within the ﬁrst 50 nt of the mRNA 50-end (41)
compared to the position +124 nt as described earlier,
we investigated whether moving the quadruplex
upstream towards the 50-end of the mRNA would have
any eﬀect on the suppression of gene expression. For this
purpose, we inserted 4G3U as well as 6G3U along with
their control sequences at two additional positions (+12
and +95, Supplementary Table 1) in our hRluc reporter
construct to evaluate any positional eﬀects on expression.
We found a gradual but minor decrease in suppression for
both 4G3U and 6G3U, but not in control constructs, when
we moved the motif towards the 50-end (Figure 3A). In
conclusion, we observed pronounced suppression of gene
expression in all characterized positions in contrast to the
study carried out by Balasubramanian and co-workers.
This discrepancy may be due to a diﬀerent experimental
setup with respect to the plasmid backbone, 50-UTR
sequence or read-out [a combined in-vitro transcription /
translation assay was used before to quantify interference
with gene expression (41)].
Next, in order to clarify whether the results obtained
with our artiﬁcially engineered sequences are transferable
to naturally occurring quadruplex motifs in mRNAs, we
reinvestigated the NRAS G4 motif sequence characterized
Figure 2. In vitro stability and in vivo abundancy of the quadruplex motifs. The CD scans (black) show a positive band around 264 nm and negative
maxima around 240 nm for 4G3U (A), 4G3U2 (B) and 4G3U3 (C), characteristic for a parallel stranded quadruplex motif, while the respective control
sequences; con4G3U (A), con4G3U2 (B) and con4G3U3 (C) does not show any quadruplex characteristic peaks (grey). In CD melting experiments
(D), denaturing (hollow) and annealing (solid) curves are almost identical and show a Tm of >95, 73 and 61
C for 4G3U (dark grey), 4G3U2 (grey)
and 4G3U3 (light grey) RNA-quadruplex motifs, respectively. (E) Relative hRluc mRNA levels for diﬀerent constructs determined by real-time PCR
assays [hRluc(CT)] is normalized to hluc mRNA levels [hluc(CT)], as reported earlier (35). Error bars represent standard deviation of three indepen-
dent experiments.

by Balasubramanian and co-workers together with three
additional natural 50-UTR quadruplex sequences (termed
4NRAS, 5CHST2, 4MAPK2 and 6PCGF2, Supple-
mentary Table 2). For this purpose, we introduced the
natural quadruplex motifs into the synthetic luciferase
50-UTR (+124 from transcription start site / 11 from
start codon, Supplementary Table 1). We were especially
interested whether the general tendencies observed with
our synthetic quadruplex sequences with respect to loop
lengths and number of GGG repeats would allow for
predicting the inﬂuence of the natural motifs on gene
expression. Reliably, for the 4NRAS RNA G4 motif
(with respective loop-lengths of 1, 2 and 3 nucleotides)
the repression (50%, Figure 3B) closely matched the syn-
thetic analogue 4G3U2 (44%, Figure 3B). In case of the
other natural motifs 4MAPK2, 5CHST2 and 6PCGF2, the
repression (70, 59 and 78%, Figure 3B) also compared
well to the synthetic motifs closely resembling loop
lengths and ‘GGG’-repeat numbers (4G3U, 5G3U2 and
6G3U2 with reductions of 64, 57 and 70%, respectively,
Figure 1B). Given the overall consistency of repression of
naturally occurring 50-UTR G4 motifs to corresponding
synthetic RNA G4 motifs under similar conditions, our
study presents a rationale to estimate the eﬀect of natu-
rally occurring RNA G4 motifs on gene expression. Small
variations are expected to arise from the diﬀerent
nucleotide composition in loops, which are known to
aﬀect the stability of the G4 motif and consequently
gene expression (37). Finally, to determine whether the
observed quadruplex-mediated repression was speciﬁc to
the adenovirus-transformed HEK293 cell line, we
repeated the experiments using the poorly diﬀerentiated
human glioblastoma cell line LN18, the human cervical

Importantly, consistent but in some cases less pronounced
results were obtained (Supplementary Figure 4). In
general, the suppressive eﬀects seem to be slightly less
prominent using these fundamentally diﬀerent cell lines
with the eﬀect of diﬀerent loop-lengths being less pro-
nounced as well. Overall, the eﬀects of the diﬀerent
quadruplexes are observed in these alternate cell lines as
well. This ﬁnding further strengthens the evidence that
quadruplex formation in 50-UTRs aﬀect expressions
by a rather unspeciﬁc mechanism correlating with thermo-
dynamic stability.
Taken together, the presented work represents the most
systematic in vivo study of synthetic and naturally
occurring quadruplex motifs located in 50-UTRs in mam-
malian cell lines. The results demonstrate a coherent
impact of RNA quadruplex formation on gene expression
and suggest a universal ‘translational-suppressor’ eﬀect
for these non-canonical RNA conformations. We found
a predictable correlation of the suppressive eﬀects of RNA
quadruplexes with its authoritative features such as
loop length and repeat numbers, representing an out-
standing example of a facile structure—function relation-
ship of unusual nucleic acid conformations in cellular
mechanisms. The present study should allow for predict-
ing the suppressive eﬀects of similar RNA quadruplexes in
50-UTRs discovered in natural sequence contexts.
Moreover, the present system should prove useful for a
setup to characterize small molecules selectively targeting
RNA quadruplexes.
