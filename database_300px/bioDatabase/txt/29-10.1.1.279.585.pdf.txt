ABSTRACT
Meganucleases, or homing endonucleases (HEs)
are sequence-specific endonucleases with large
(.14 bp) cleavage sites that can be used to induce
efficient homologous gene targeting in cultured
cells and plants. These findings have opened
novel perspectives for genome engineering in
a wide range of fields, including gene therapy.
However, the number of identified HEs does not
match the diversity of genomic sequences, and the
probability of finding a homing site in a chosen gene
is extremely low. Therefore, the design of artificial
endonucleases with chosen specificities is under
intense investigation. In this report, we describe the
first artificial HEs whose specificity has been
entirely redesigned to cleave a naturally occurring
sequence. First, hundreds of novel endonucleases
with locally altered substrate specificity were
derived from I-CreI, a Chlamydomonas reinhardti
protein belonging to the LAGLIDADG family of HEs.
Second, distinct DNA-binding subdomains were
identified within the protein. Third, we used these
findings to assemble four sets of mutations into
heterodimeric endonucleases cleaving a model
target or a sequence from the human RAG1 gene.
These results demonstrate that the plasticity of
LAGLIDADG endonucleases allows extensive engi-
neering, and provide a general method to create
novel endonucleases with tailored specificities.
INTRODUCTION
Meganucleases are sequence-specific endonucleases with
large (>14 bp) cleavage sites that can deliver DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs) at specific loci in living cells (1).
Meganucleases have been used to stimulate homologous
recombination in the vicinity of their target sequences in
cultured cells and plants (2–6), and these results have opened
new perspectives for genome engineering in a wide range
of applications. For example, meganucleases could be
used to induce the correction of mutations linked with
monogenic inherited diseases, and bypass the risks due to
the randomly inserted transgenes used in current gene therapy
approaches (7).
The use of meganuclease-induced recombination has long
been limited by the repertoire of natural meganucleases. In
nature, meganucleases are essentially represented by homing
endonucleases (HEs), a family of endonucleases encoded by
mobile genetic elements, whose function is to initiate DNA
DSB-induced recombination events in a process referred to
as homing (8). Several hundreds of HEs have been identified
in bacteria, eukaryotes and archaea (8); however, the proba-
bility of finding a HE cleavage site in a chosen gene is
very low. Thus, the making of artificial meganucleases with
tailored substrate specificity has become the goal of several
laboratories (9–14). Recently, Zinc-Finger DNA-binding
domains (15) could be fused with the catalytic domain of
the FokI endonuclease, to induce recombination in various
cells types, including human lymphoid cells (16–18) . How-
ever, these proteins have demonstrated high toxicity in cells
(16,19), probably due to a low level of specificity. Given
their biological function and their exquisite specificity, HEs
could represent ideal scaffolds, but engineering their DNA-
binding domain has long been considered a daunting task
(9–14), and more generally, engineering the substrate specifi-
city of proteins that cleave or recombine DNA has often
proven to be difficult (20–23).
In a recent report, we described a semi-rational mutagene-
sis approach coupled with high-throughput screening (HTS)
to derive hundreds of novel endonucleases with locally
altered substrate specificity from I-CreI, a HE from the
LAGLIDADG family (11,24). We also suggested a combina-
torial approach to globally engineer the DNA-binding domain
of such proteins in a rational way, and eventually design

tailored HEs cleaving chosen targets. This strategy relied on
the hypothetical identification of several independent DNA-
binding units within I-CreI or related proteins. LAGLIDADG
proteins have a conserved core structure, with two character-
istic abbabba folds facing each other across a 2-fold
symmetry or pseudo-symmetry axis (8). Whereas it had
been shown that two abbabba folds can be associated
with heterodimeric (11) or single chain (25,26) molecules,
it was unclear whether each fold could in turn be separated
into distinct functional binding units.
We have now implemented this combinatorial strategy. In
a first step, we have created novel I-CreI variants with locally
altered substrate specificity, by modifying different parts of
the abbabba folds. Second, we have identified two rela-
tively independent DNA-binding subdomains within the
same abbabba fold: mutations in different parts of the
protein could be assembled to create novel endonucleases
with predictable substrate specificities, without affecting
activity and stability. Third, we used these findings to assem-
ble four sets of mutations into heterodimeric endonucleases
with fully engineered specificity, to cleave a model target
and finally a sequence from the human RAG1 gene. This is
the first time a homing endonuclease is entirely redesigned
to cleave a naturally occurring sequence, but our results
also provide a general method to create novel endonucleases
cleaving chosen sequences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of mutant libraries and target vectors
I-CreI N75 (25) mutant library randomized at four positions
(28,33,38,40) with 10 defined amino acids (ADEKNQRSTY),
and with a R70S substitution was generated by Biomethodes
(Evry, France), resulting in a theoretical diversity of 104. Two
smaller libraries of complexity 1728 (123) were designed by
randomization of three positions (30,33,38 and 28,30,38) and
were constructed using VVK degenerate codons (18 codons,
amino acids ADEGHKNPQRST) as described previously
(11). In addition, small libraries of complexity 225 (152)
resulting from the randomization of only two positions
were constructed in an I-CreI N75 or I-CreI D75 scaffold,
using NVK degenerate codons (24 codons, amino acids
ACDEGHKNPQRSTWY). All libraries were introduced
into the two micron-based replicative vector pCLS542
marked with the LEU2 gene and transformed into the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FYC2-6A (MATa,
trp1D63, leu2D1 and his3D200) as described previously
(11). Yeast reporter vectors were constructed and transformed
into the S.cerevisiae strain FYBL2-7B (MAT a, ura3D851,
trp1D63, leu2D1 and lys2D202) as described previously (11).
Construction of combinatorial mutant HEs
To generate an I-CreI coding sequence containing mutations
derived from different libraries (28,30,33,38,40 and 44,68,70
or 44,68,70,75,77 amino acids), separate overlapping PCR
were carried out that amplify the 50 end (residues 1–43) or
the 30 end (residues 39–167) of the I-CreI coding sequence.
For both the 50 and 30 end, PCR amplification is carried out
using a primer specific to the vector (pCLS0542) (Gal10F
50-GCAACTTTAGTGCTGACACATACAGG-30 or Gal10R
50-ACAACCTTGATTGGAGACTTGACC-30) and a primer
specific to the I-CreI coding sequence for 39–43 amino
acids (assF 50-CTAXXXTTGACCTTT-30 or assR 50-
AAAGGTCAAXXXTAG-30) where XXX codes for mutant
residue 40. The resulting PCR products contain 15 bp of
homology with each other and 100–200 bp of homology
with the two micron-based replicative vectors, pCLS542,
marked with the LEU2 gene and pCLS1107, containing a
kanamycin resistant gene. Thus, to generate an intact coding
sequence by in vivo homologous recombination, 25 ng of
each of the two overlapping PCR fragments and either
25 ng of the pCLS0542 vector DNA linearized by digestion
with NcoI and EagI or 25 ng of the pCLS1107 vector DNA
linearized by digestion with DraIII and NgoMIV were used
to transform the yeast S.cerevisiae strain FYC2-6A (MATa,
trp1D63, leu2D1 and his3D200) using a high efficiency
LiAc transformation protocol (27). For COMB targets, com-
binatorial mutants were generated individually, whereas for
RAG targets, mutants were generated as libraries: PCR
were pooled in equimolar amounts and transformed into
yeast together with the linearized plasmid. Transformants
were selected on either synthetic medium lacking leucine
(pCLS542) or rich medium containing G418 (pCLS1107).
Screening in yeast
For screening homodimers and heterodimers, we used either
the protocol described previously (11), or a modified proce-
dure wherein yeast mating occurs in liquid medium.
Hierarchical clustering
Clustering was done using hclust from the R package. We
used quantitative data from the secondary screening. Variants
were clustered using standard hierarchical clustering with
Euclidean distance and Ward’s method (28). Mutant dendro-
gram was cut at the height of 17 to define the clusters. For the
analysis (see e.g. Table 1) cumulated intensities of cleavage
of a target within a cluster was calculated as the sum of the
cleavage intensities of all cluster’s mutants with this target,
normalized to the sum of the cleavage intensities of all
cluster’s mutants with all targets.
Biochemical and biophysical characterization of
proteins
Novel I-CreI variants were expressed, purified and analyzed
for in vitro cleavage as reported previously (11). Circular
dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a Jasco
J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.2 cm path length quartz
cuvette. Equilibrium unfolding was induced increasing
temperature at a rate of 1C/min (using a programmable
Peltier thermoelectric). Samples were prepared by dialysis
against 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), at
protein concentrations of 20 mM.
RESULTS
Functional endonucleases with new specificity towards
±8, ±9 and ±10 nt
In a previous study we have reported the engineering of
hundreds of new endonucleases with altered substrate

specificities (11), derived from I-CreI, a dimeric protein that
cleaves a 22 bp pseudo-palindromic target. The screening
of libraries mutated at positions 44, 68 and 70 against the
64 palindromic DNA targets degenerated at ±3, ±4 and ±5
nt (5NNN, see Figure 1) resulted in the isolation and identi-
fication of numerous new HEs with novel specificities.
Since then, we have generated other libraries with additional
randomized residues, such as D75 and I77, and obtained
hundreds of additional novel endonucleases targeting 5NNN
target (P. Duchateau and F. Paˆques, unpublished data).
In this report, we used the same approach to identify I-CreI
derivatives with new substrate specificities towards positions
±8, ±9 and ±10 (10NNN) of C1221 (Figure 1), a palindromic
22 bp DNA target cleaved by I-CreI (29). Indeed, analysis
of the I-CreI structure bound to its DNA target revealed
that residues K28, N30, Y33, Q38 and S40 interact directly
or indirectly with the bases located at position ±8, ±9 and
±10 of the original I-CreI DNA target (Figure 1). In order
to be consistent with a previous study (11), we first intro-
duced a D75N mutation, to allow more diversity in positions
68 and 70, in the final combinatorial mutants. This mutation,
which resulted in an altered substrate specificity on 5NNN
targets (11), changes the specificity for 10NNN targets as
well, with a dramatic narrowing of the cleavage pattern
(Figure 2b). Randomization of 5 amino acid positions
would lead to a theoretical diversity of 205 ¼ 3.2 · 106.
We chose to generate libraries with lower diversity by
randomizing 2, 3 or 4 residues at a time, resulting in a
diversity of 225 (152), 1728 (123) or 10 000 (104), as
described in Materials and Methods. This strategy allowed
us to screen extensively each of these libraries against the
64 palindromic 10NNN DNA targets using a yeast based

assay described previously (25), and whose principle is
described in Figure 2a.
After secondary screening and sequencing of positives over
the entire coding region, a total of 1484 unique mutants were
isolated showing a cleavage activity against at least one
target. Different patterns could be observed (Figure 2b). As
shown previously for wild-type I-CreI or derived mutants,
we found cleavage degeneracy for many of the novel endonu-
cleases we identified, with an average of 9.9 cleaved targets
per mutant (SD: 11). However, among the 1484 mutants
identified, 219 (15%) were found to cleave only one DNA
target, 179 (12%) cleave two, and 169 (11%) and 120 (8%)
were able to cleave 3 and 4 targets, respectively. Thus, irre-
spective of their preferred target, a significant number of
I-CreI derivatives display a specificity level that is similar
if not higher than that of the I-CreI N75 mutant (3 10NNN
target sequences cleaved), or I-CreI (16 10NNN target
sequences cleaved), in accordance with previous observations
with the 5NNN targets (11). Also, the majority of the
mutants isolated for altered specificity for 5NNN and
10NNN sequences no longer cleave the original C1221 target
sequence described in Figure 1c (61 and 59%, respectively).
Altogether, this large collection of mutants allowed us
to target all of the 64 possible DNA sequences differing at
positions ±10, ±9 and ±8. However, there were huge varia-
tions in the numbers of mutants cleaving each target
(Figure 2c), these numbers ranged from 3 to 936, with an
average of 228.5 (SD: 201.5). Cleavage was frequently
observed for targets with a G in ±8 or A in ±9, whereas a
C in ±10 or ±8 were correlated with low numbers of cleavers.
In addition, all targets were not cleaved with the same effici-
ency. Since significant variations of signal could be observed
for a same target, depending on the mutant (compare
cleavage efficiencies for the wild-type 10AAA target in
Figure 2b, for example), an average cleavage efficiency was
measured for each target as reported previously (11). These
average efficiencies are represented by gray levels on
Figure 2c. Analysis of the results show a clear correlation
between this average efficiency and the numbers of cleavers,
with the most frequently cut target being also the most
efficiently cut (e.g. compare 10TCN, 10CTN and 10CCN
targets with 10GAN, 10AAN and 10TAN in Figure 2c).
Statistical analysis of interactions between I-CreI
variants and their targets

lish potential correlations between specific protein residues

and target bases (11). Using the same approach, we could
identify 10 different mutant clusters (data not shown),
described in Table 1. Analysis of the residues found in
each cluster showed strong biases for all randomized posi-
tions. None of the residues is mutated in all libraries used
in this study, and the residues found in the I-CreI scaffold
were expected to be overrepresented. Indeed, K28, N30 and
S40 were the most frequent residues in all 10 clusters,
and we cannot really infer any conclusion for DNA–protein
interactions. However, Y33 was the most represented residue
only in clusters 7, 8 and 10, whereas strong occurrence of
other residues, such as H, R, G, T, C, P or S, was observed
in the seven other clusters. The wild-type Q38 residue was
overrepresented in all clusters but one, R and K being more
frequent in cluster 4.
Meanwhile, the occurrence of a specific residue at posi-
tions 33 could often be correlated with a strong preference
for a specific base in position ±10 of the DNA target. Preva-
lence of Y33 was associated with high frequencies of adenine
(74.9 and 64.3% in clusters 7 and 10, respectively), and this
correlation was also observed, although to a lesser extent in
clusters 4, 5 and 8. H33 or R33 were correlated with a
guanine (63.0, 56.3 and 58.5%, in clusters 1, 4 and 5, respec-
tively) and T33, C33 or S33 with a thymine (45.6 and 56.3 in
clusters 3 and 9, respectively). G33 was relatively frequent
in cluster 2, the cluster with the most even base representation
in ±10. These results are consistent with the observations
of Seligman and collaborators, who showed previously that
a Y33R or Y33H mutation shifted the specificity of I-CreI
toward a guanine and Y33C, Y33T, Y33S (and also Y33L)
towards a thymine in position ±10 (14). We also observed
correlated biases for residue 38 and position ±9 of the target:
R38 and K38 were associated with an exceptional high
frequency of guanine in cluster 4, while in all the other
clusters, the wild-type Q38 residue was overrepresented, as
well as an adenine in ±9 of the target.
The structure of I-CreI bound to its target (29,30) has
shown that Y33 and Q38 contact two adenines in 10 and
9 (Figure 1), and our results suggest that these interactions
are probably maintained in many of our mutants. We have

previously described similar results for residue 44 and
position ±4 (11). However, when we compare the results
obtained for the 33/±10, 38/±9 and 44/±4 couples, significant
differences are observed. For a guanine, we find mostly R
and H in position 33, R or K in 38 and K in 44, for adenine,
Y in 33 and Q in 38 and 44, and for thymine, S, C or T in 33
and A in 44. In the three cases, no clear pattern is observed
for cytosine.
Identification of distinct DNA-binding sub-domains
within the same abbabba fold
The identification of distinct groups of mutations in the I-CreI
coding sequence that alter the cleavage specificity towards
two different regions of the C1221 target sequence (10NNN
and 5NNN) raises the possibility of combining these two
groups of mutants intramolecularly to generate a combinato-
rial mutant capable of cleaving a target sequence simultane-
ously altered at positions 10NNN and 5NNN (Figure 3a).
To test this hypothesis, we first designed a model non-
palindromic target sequence that would be a patchwork
of four cleaved 5NNN and 10NNN targets. This target,
COMB1, differs from the C1221 consensus sequence at
positions ±3, ±4, ±5, ±8, ±9 and ±10 (Figure 3b). In addition,
we designed two derived target sequences representing the
left (COMB2) and right (COMB3) halves in palindromic
form (Figure 3b). To generate appropriate I-CreI combinato-
rial mutants capable of targeting the palindromic targets,
mutants efficiently cleaving the 10NNN and 5NNN part of
each palindromic sequence were selected (Tables 2 and 3),
and their characteristic mutations incorporated into the
same coding sequence by in vivo cloning in yeast (see
Figure 3b and Materials and Methods). Basically, mutations
at positions 28, 30, 33, 38 and 40 from mutants cleaving
10NNN targets were associated with mutations at position
44, 68 and 70 from mutants cleaving 5NNN targets.
Throughout the text and Figures, combinatorial mutants
for COMB sequences are named with an eight letter
code, after residues at positions 28, 30, 33, 38, 40, 44,
68 and 70 (e.g. NNSRK/AAR stands for I-CreI
28N30N33S38R40K44A68A70R75N). Parental controls are
named with a five letter or three letter code, after residues
at positions 28, 30, 33, 38 and 40 (NNSRK stands for
I-CreI 28N30N33S38R40K70S75N) or 44, 68 and 70 (AAR
stands for I-CreI 44AQ68A70R75N).
Combinatorial mutants were then screened against the
appropriate target sequence, COMB2 or COMB3, using our
meganuclease-induced recombination assay in yeast.
Among the 93 different I-CreI combined mutants screened
with the COMB2 target, 29 (31%) were found to cleave the
palindromic target site (Table 2 and Figure 4). Similarly,
210 combinatorial mutants were tested with the COMB3
target and 69 (33%) were found to be active (Table 3).
Cleavage of both COMB2 and COMB3 is specific to the
combinatorial mutant as each of the parents was unable to
cleave the target sequence (Figure 4 and data not shown).
In addition, while the parental mutants displayed efficient
cleavage of the 5NNN and 10NNN target sequences, all
combinatorial mutants but one displayed no significant
activity for these sequences (Figure 4 and data not shown),
or for the original C1221 sequence (data not shown). The
only exception was NNSRR/ARS, which was found to faintly
cleave the 5GAC target (Figure 4). These results indicate that

68, 70 can give rise to functional endonucleases and thus con-
firm the hypothesis that the two regions of the protein can act
independently.
Biochemical and biophysical analysis of homodimeric
combinatorial mutants
Four combinatorial mutants cleaving COMB2 or COMB3,
and their corresponding parent mutants were analyzed
in vitro in order to compare their relative cleavage efficien-
cies. As can be observed in Figures 5a–c, cleavage of the
combined palindromic target sequences (COMB2 or
COMB3) is specific to the combinatorial mutants since
the two parent mutants were unable to cleave these
sequences. In addition, while the parental mutants displayed
efficient cleavage of the 5NNN and 10NNN target sequences,
only one out of the four combinatorial mutants (NNSRK/
ARR) displayed a faint activity on one of these targets,
the others being totally inactive (data not shown). Thus,
results from the yeast assay were confirmed in vitro.
Importantly, the differences in activity levels between
mutants were also consistent with the variations observed in
yeast, and this congruency was further confirmed by the
in vitro study of four additional mutants cleaving COMB3
(data not shown). Thus, the variations of signal observed
in yeast are not due to differences in expression levels,
but really reflect differences in binding/and or cleavage
properties.
Finally, analysis of the structure and stability of this group
of combinatorial mutants was performed using far-UV CD
(Figure 5d), 1H-NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation
(data not shown). All the mutants are dimers and their
secondary and tertiary structures (data not shown) as well
as thermal denaturation curves (Figure 5d) are similar to
that of the original I-CreI N75 protein, showing that engineer-
ing did not result in a significant alteration of the structure,
folding or stability of these proteins.
Co-expression of combinatorial mutants results in
cleavage of chimeric target sites
To determine if combinatorial mutants could function effi-
ciently as heterodimers, a subset of mutants capable of
cleaving the palindromic sites COMB2 and COMB3 were
co-expressed in yeast and assayed for their ability to cleave
the chimeric site COMB1, corresponding to the fusion of
the two half sites of the original targets (Figure 6a). As can
be observed in Figure 6a, co-expression resulted in cleavage
of the chimeric sequence COMB1 among all tested het-
erodimers. This activity appears to be specific to the
heterodimers since each one of the mutants expressed alone
displayed no detectable activity with the chimeric target
site (Figure 6a). In general, co-expression of two mutants
displaying strong activity for COMB2 and/or COMB3 will
result in a higher level of activity for the chimeric site than
a co-expression of two mutants displaying weak activity
(e.g. compare KNHQS/KEG · NNSRK/ARR with QNRQR/
KEG · NNSRK/ASR in Figure 6a).
Cleavage of the COMB1 target was also detected in vitro
when the KNHQS/KAS and NNSRK/ARR purified proteins
were incubated together with the COMB1 target in our
conditions, while incubation of single protein did not give
rise to any detectable cleavage activity (data not shown).
However, the cleavage efficiency was extremely low, which
might result from slow heterodimer formation in vitro.
Indeed, Silva et al. could show that engineered derivatives
from I-DmoI had to be coexpressed in Escherichia coli to
form active heterodimers (31), and is not clear whether
I-CreI homodimers can exchange subunits easily. Actually,
we cannot exclude that low levels of cleavage could result
from an alternative pathway, such as subsequent nicking
by the two homodimers in solution, and we are currently
investigating this issue.
Altogether, our results indicate that a combinatorial
approach can generate artificial HEs capable of effectively
cleaving chimeric target sites altered at position 10NNN
and 5NNN.
Redesigned HEs cleave a natural target sequence in the
RAG1 gene
To analyze the effectiveness of a combinatorial approach for
designing HEs for natural target sites, the human RAG1 gene
was analyzed for potential sites compatible with mutants
present in the 10NNN and 5NNN libraries. RAG1 has been
shown to form a complex with RAG2 that is responsible

Analysis of the genomic locus of RAG1 revealed a poten-
tial target site located 11 bp upstream of the coding exon of
RAG1, that we called RAG1.1 (Figure 3c). In contrast to the
COMB sequence, the RAG1.1 site not only differs from
the C1221 site at position 10NNN and 5NNN but also at
11N (11T instead of 11C) and 7NN (7CT instead of 7AC).
I-CreI D75N is tolerant to these changes (data not shown),
and we made the assumption that our combinatorial mutants
would also be tolerant to changes at these positions. For the
5NNN region, we used mutants from the previously reported
library mutated at positions 44, 68, 70 (11), as well as from
another library mutated at positions 44, 68, 75 and 77, with
a serine residue at position 70 (S. Grizot, P. Duchateau and
F. Paˆques, unpublished data). Since additional residues
were mutated, combinatorial mutants are named after 10
residues instead of 8, the two last letters corresponding to
the residues at position 75 and 77 (e.g. KNTAK/NYSYN
stands for I-CreI 28K30N33T38A40K44N68Y70S75Y77N).
In contrast with the mutants used for COMB targets, which
were generated individually, mutants used for RAG targets
were generated in libraries (see Materials and Methods).
For the RAG1.2 target sequence, a library with a putative
complexity of 1300 mutants was generated. Screening
of 2256 clones yielded 64 positives (2.8%), which after
sequencing, turned out to correspond to 49 unique endonucle-
ases. For RAG1.3, 2280 clones were screened, and 88
positives were identified (3.8%), corresponding to 59 unique
endonucleases. In both cases, the combinatorial mutants were

unable to cleave the 5NNN and 10NNN target sequences as
well as the original C1221 sequence (data not shown).
As for COMB1, a panel of mutants able to cleave the
palindromic targets was then co-expressed in the yeast
to test the RAG1.1 target cleavage. Figure 6b shows that
co-expression resulted in the cleavage of the natural target.
In contrast, none of these mutants was able to cleave
RAG1.1 when expressed alone (Figure 6b). We concluded
that RAG1.1 target cleavage is due to the heterodimers
resulting from co-expression.
DISCUSSION
Altering the substrate specificity of DNA-binding proteins
by mutagenesis and screening/selection is a difficult task.
Several laboratories have relied on a semi-rational approach
to limit the diversity of the mutant libraries to be handled
(35): a small set of relevant residues is chosen according to
structural data. This strategy was used to successfully engi-
neer the substrate specificity of HEs from the LAGLIDADG
family, such as PI-SceI SceI (10), I-CreI (14) and I-SceI (12).
In a more elaborate approach, computational analysis based
on energy calculation could be used to pinpoint key residues
with good accuracy in I-CreI (11) and I-MsoI (9). Recently,
we have combined semi-rational mutagenesis and high-
throughput screening to conduct a large scale study that
identified hundreds of I-CreI derivatives with altered sub-
strate specificity (11). Three I-CreI residues were mutated
simultaneously, and several novel targets were cleaved,
differing from the I-CreI target by up to 3 bp. Nevertheless,
this was still not sufficient to create redesigned endonucleases
cleaving chosen sequences. In addition, it was clear that a
global engineering of the I-CreI DNA-binding interface
could not be achieved by a mere scale up of the approach.
Analysis of the I-CreI/DNA crystal structure indicates that
9 amino acids make direct contacts with the homing site
(29,36), which randomization would result in 209 combina-
tions, a number beyond any screening capacity today. Thus,
we hypothesized that it would be possible to first generate
smaller libraries, to create novel endonucleases with locally
altered substrate specificity, and then to combine these
mutations into globally engineered mutants, in order to cleave
chosen targets that widely differ from the I-CreI substrate
(Figure 3a).
The first step was to create novel collections of I-CreI
derivatives, by engineering another region of the DNA-
binding domain, involved in the binding of the 10NNN target
base pairs. Again, hundreds of novel variants were obtained,
and the conclusions are very similar to the ones we obtained
previously (11): mutants with novel substrate specificity can
keep high levels of activity and the specificity of the novel
proteins can be even narrower than that of the wild-type
protein for its target. Second, strong correlations were
observed between the nature of residues 33 and 38 and
substrate discrimination at positions ±10 and ±9 of the target.
We have previously reported similar results for residue 44
and position ±4 (11). However, a given base can be correlated
with different residues. For example, an adenine can be
frequently bound by a Y or a Q, and a guanine by a H, a R
or a K, depending on the position. Thus, there is no universal
‘code’, but rather a series of solutions for contacting each
base, the best solution depending on a more general context,
very similar to what has been observed with Zinc Finger
proteins (15).
Our results, obtained by statistical analysis, fit those
obtained by Seligman et al. (14) who determined the impact
of single mutations at position 33, and observed the same
preferences. In addition, the characterization of individual
mutants has allowed for the identification of novel residue/
base patterns for 32/±11 and 26/±6, and it would be interest-
ing to determine whether these studies can be confirmed by
statistical analysis of a large number of mutants.
Since the generation of a series of I-CreI derivatives with
altered specificity, as well as the assembly of such variants in
heterodimers has been reported previously (11), the most
challenging step was the identification of independent
binding sub-domains within a same abbabba fold, and the
assembly of mutations from such distinct sub-domains into
combinatorial mutants. Structural analysis of I-CreI C33
and H33 mutants bound to their cognate DNA target have
indicated that substitution of individual residue/base contact
patterns can occur without significant structural deformation
(37). However, other positions could be less tolerant. In
addition, the cumulative impact of a series of mutations
could eventually disrupt proper folding. Generation of combi-
natorial mutants for the COMB2 and COMB3 targets resulted
in functional proteins with the expected specificity for 30%
of the tested combinations, and as previously (11), in vitro
tests on a subset of purified mutants confirmed the data
from the yeast assay. In addition, NMR and CD data indicate
that combinatorial mutants do not display significant alter-
ations in structure or stability. Thus, the two sets of residues
that we have mutated, K28, N30, Y33, Q38 and S40 on one
hand, Q44, R68 and R70 on the other, define two relatively
independent binding sub-domains. With the RAG1.2 and
RAG1.3 targets, 2.8 and 3.8% of positives were obtained,
respectively. In contrast with COMB mutants, which were
generated and tested individually, RAG mutants were gener-
ated as libraries. Nevertheless, no obvious bias was detected
in these libraries, and these frequencies should be representa-
tive of the real frequency of functional positives. This lower
success rate, compared with screening with the COMB
targets, could be due to the additional mutations at positions
75 and 77, or from the additional changes at positions ±6, ±7
and ±11 in these targets. Nevertheless, the making of these
combinatorial mutants opens large possibilities for it is the
key step towards global engineering of the DNA-binding
interface of LAGLIDADG proteins.
For genome engineering applications, the major advantage
of HEs is their exquisite specificity (16), a feature that
becomes essential when engaging into therapeutic applica-
tions. However, the use of HEs has so far been limited by
the lack of means to engineer their DNA-binding domain.
Although, several locally engineered endonucleases cleaving
novel model target sequences have been reported before
(9–12,14,37), this is the first time a HE is redesigned to
cleave a naturally occurring sequence. Furthermore, these
results validate a general method that can be applied to
many other gene sequences. In former studies, the targets
of the engineered proteins differed from the initial wild-
type substrate by 1–6 bp per site (9–12,14,37), whereas the
e149 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 22 PAGE 10 OF 12
22 bp COMB1 and RAG1 sequences differ from the C1221
target between 9 and 16 bp, respectively. The generation of
collections of I-CreI derivatives allows today for cleavage
of all 64 10NNN targets (this study) and 62 out of the 64
5NNN targets (P. Duchateau and F. Paˆques, unpublished
data). The ability to combine them intramolecularly as well
as intermolecularly, increases the number of attainable
22mers to at least 1.57 · 107 [(64 · 62)2]. The ability to
find variants cleaving targets modified at other positions,
such as 11N, 7NN and 2NN, should further increase this
number, to a point that remains to be determined.
Eventually, the ability to cleave any chosen sequence
efficiently will probably require further developments. The
recent development of computational biology might bridge
the gap between the space of sequence that can be reached
by pure experimental means, and genome complexity. Energy
calculation could be used to predict the impact of local
mutations on I-CreI (11)and I-MsoI (9). The same approaches
could be applied to our combinatorial approach, and would
allow one to discard non-functional combinations a priori,
or suggest additional compensatory mutations that would
abolish structural deformations. Therefore, we can envision
a much wider use of HEs from the LAGLIDADG family to
modify a large number of genes in a specific way.
