ABSTRACT
TheSWISS-MODELRepository isadatabaseofannot-
ated 3D protein structure models generated by the
SWISS-MODEL homology-modelling pipeline. As of
September 2005, the repository contained 675 000
models for 604 000 different protein sequences of
the UniProt database. Regular updates ensure that
the content of the repository reflects the current
state of sequence and structure databases, integrat-
ing new or modified target sequences, and making
use of new template structures. Each Repository
entryconsistsofoneormore3Dmodelsaccompanied
by detailed information about the target protein and
the model building process: functional annotation, a
detailed template selection log, target-template align-
ment, summary of the model building and model
quality assessment. The SWISS-MODEL Repository
is freely accessible at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/
repository/.
INTRODUCTION
The rational design of many types of biological experiments is
greatly facilitated by insights into the molecular mechanisms
of biological macromolecules gained from their 3D structures.
Proteins as the ‘working molecules’ of living cells are in the
focus of several systematic structural genomics efforts (1).
Although tremendous progress has been made in experimental
structure determination by X-ray crystallography and NMR in
recent years, the number of structurally characterized proteins
is still small compared with the number of known protein
sequences: while the UniProt protein knowledge base (2)
reported more than 2 million sequence entries in September
2005, at the same time only 35 000 database entries for
experimentally determined protein structures were deposited
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (3).
A wide spectrum of computational methods to predict the
3D structures of proteins has been developed to overcome this
limitation, ranging from ab initio methods aiming to predict
protein structures without prior knowledge, to comparative
modelling approaches making use of information from experi-
mentally determined protein structures. As the 3D structures of
proteins are better conserved than their sequences (4), the
experimentally known structure of one protein can be used
as template to generate a model for other proteins of the same
family sharing sufficient sequence homology (target). The
accuracy and reliability of different structure prediction
approaches have been assessed in several rounds of CASP
(Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure
Prediction) experiments (5). Comparative (or homology) mod-
elling has been shown to be the most accurate method (6), able
to reliably build 3D protein models with sufficient accuracy for
applications such as structure-based drug design, or rational-
izing the effects of sequence variations (7–9).
All homology modelling approaches consist of the follow-
ing four steps: identification of suitable template structure(s),
alignment of template structure(s) and target sequence, build-
ing of one or more 3D model(s), and model quality evaluation.
These steps can be repeated iteratively until a satisfying mod-
elling result is achieved and the best model is selected (7,10).
The number of structurally uncharacterized protein
sequences is huge and growing constantly, and at the same
time new template structures are being determined by indi-
vidual research groups or structural genomics efforts (1). Fully
automated, stable and reliable modelling pipelines (11–13)
had to be created to handle this steady flow of new data.
SWISS-MODEL has been established as an expert system
for automated homology modelling, integrating the necessary
databases, tools and computing resources in an easy to use
web-based modelling workbench (11,14). The accuracy and
reliability of the SWISS-MODEL server are continuously
monitored by the EVA-CM evaluation project (15).
Interactive modelling servers require significant time to
complete a certain modelling request, whereas model data-
bases provide instant and queryable access to pre-computed
models. Databases of models generated by automated proced-
ures on large scale, such as SWISS-MODEL Repository (16)
or ModBase (17), give easy access to regularly updated homo-
logy models and thereby help to enrich other database projects

with structural information. Structural genomics projects and
model databases complement one another in the coverage of
the protein structure space (18). In this paper we describe new
features and improved functionalities of the SWISS-MODEL
Repository.
SWISS-MODEL REPOSITORY
The SWISS-MODEL Repository is a database of annotated 3D
protein models created by the fully automated SWISS-
MODEL server pipeline (14). The model database can be
accessed via a web interface, and the models are freely avail-
able at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/. For a given
UniProt entry, a model navigator indicates those regions in the
protein, where 3D models are available and allows for fast
selection of the individual models. The navigator has been
extended to incorporate biological annotations via InterPro
classification (19), and, in combination with the Target
Sequence Info view, provides the user with detailed informa-
tion about the target sequence. The model section (Figure 1a)
presents a summary for each individual model, including
information about the template structure, and the target-
template alignment used for model building. Detailed model-
ling and template selection logs contain essential information
about the modelling process, e.g. handling of insertions and
deletions. As quality evaluation is indispensable for a predict-
ive method like homology modelling, graphical representa-
tions of model assessment by Anolea mean force potentials
(20) and Gromos force field energy (21) are given for each
model (Figure 1d).
Database content
The number of models in the repository has more than doubled
over the last two years. As of September 2005, the SWISS-
MODEL Repository contained 675 000 protein models for
604 000 distinct UniProt (Release 5.8) entries. For 75 150
(39%) SwissProt entries (Release 47.8) and 528 932 (27%)
TrEMBL (Release 30.8) entries a significant part of the
sequence could be modelled. This corresponds to a per-
residue coverage of 28% for SwissProt and 17% for TrEMBL.
Model sizes range from 44 residues for the shortest model to
1512 residues for the longest model (ferredoxin-dependent
glutamate synthase from Anabena sp.), with an average
model size of 200 amino acids. Of all models 25% correspond
to bacterial proteins, 1% to archaea, 28% to viruses and 46% to
eukaryotic proteins, including 4.3% human sequences. The
aim of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is to provide accurate
models suitable for the design of biological experiments.
Therefore, care was taken to include only models with a
high level of confidence, i.e. reliable target-template align-
ments with a sequence identity higher than 40%, and accept-
able evaluation results by Anolea (20) and Gromos (21).
Cross-references with other databases
The SWISS-MODEL Repository is cross-referenced with Uni-
Prot and InterPro. A subset of high quality models of the
repository is complementing the structural information avail-
able in these two databases. Each entry in the repository
contains a sequence-based CRC64 checksum, which uniquely
identifies its corresponding amino acid sequence and
guarantees data consistency when exchanging records
between different databases. Moreover, this mechanism can
also ensure that hyperlinks between websites using UniProt
accession codes are referencing identical protein sequences.
Therefore hyperlinks to the SWISS-MODEL Repository con-
sist of the URL, a UniProt accession code, and optionally the
start residue of a model, and the CRC64 checksum of the
amino acid sequence.
Visualization of functional annotation
The interpretation of biological annotations of a protein
sequence in the context of its 3D structure is of great help
for a detailed understanding of its molecular function. Each
target sequence in the repository has a short protein description
with links to relevant sequence based resources. A graphical
representation of the InterPro functional and domain level
annotations of the target sequence indicates regions of func-
tional and structural importance in the target sequence
(Figure 1b). Their location relative to the available models
can be visualized directly from the website using the interact-
ive Java based AstexViewer applet (22) enabling the user to
analyse biologically significant substructures. Alternatively,
model coordinates can be downloaded for visualization
(Figure 1c), and further analysis using specialized software,
such as DeepView (11), Dino (http://www.dino3d.org) or
RasMol (23).
Incremental update procedure
Computing an entire release of the repository takes several
weeks on our in-house Linux cluster and is done when major
changes have been implemented, e.g. algorithmic improve-
ments in the pipeline. Fast integration of new sequence data
and new experimentally determined protein structures released
by the PDB (3) is a big benefit for the user, but poses a
challenge to the update capability of the model database.
We therefore established an incremental update procedure
which takes into account new template structures, new protein
sequence entries and modified sequences in UniProt. New or
modified protein sequences are modelled and incorporated into
the repository. When new experimentally determined struc-
tures become available, models are generated for those pro-
teins, which could not be modelled previously, and existing
models are updated for those proteins, for which better
templates are identified among the newly released structures.
Current data status of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is
shown on the entry page.
Template selection
The automated modelling pipeline performs a sequence based
search of the SWISS-MODEL template library to select the
best template to model a specific region of the target sequence,
favouring template structures with high resolution (14). How-
ever, the template selection log lists all template structures
identified during the template search with links to the SWISS-
MODEL template library. For each putative template,
information about experimental details, likely quaternary
structure (24), bound ligands, and links to external structure
databases, such as SCOP (25), CATH (26) and MSD (27), are
provided accompanied by a small ribbon representation. This
enables the user to select alternative templates, e.g. templates

with or without ligand, open or closed conformations, mul-
timeric structures, which might be more appropriate for the
specific modelling task, and to continue the modelling project
using the interactive SWISS-MODEL server architecture.
