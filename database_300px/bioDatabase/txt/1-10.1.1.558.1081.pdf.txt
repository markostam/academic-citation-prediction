[1] Analysis of Martian gravity and topography implies that crustal thickness variations
created in the earliest evolution of planet have persisted to the present day. Relaxation of
crustal thickness variations due to lower crustal flow by thermally activated creep is
strongly temperature-dependent and so, for particular crustal rheology and thickness,
provides a constraint on thermal evolution. Previous models have assumed that the
heat flux from the mantle, which controls lower crustal temperatures, simply reflects
radiogenic heat production. However, global thermal evolution models in which the
mantle cools by solid-state thermal convection indicate that the additional contribution to
near-surface heat flux due to secular cooling significant increases lower crustal
temperatures. With, a 50-km-thick crust, and a wet diabase rheology, these higher
temperatures allow crustal rock to flow fast enough to relax crustal thickness variations
during the first 750 Myr of evolution. Previous studies have not considered the presence
of an impact-brecciated crustal layer that would almost certainly be present on early Mars
and could have a significant influence on crustal temperatures. The presence of a dry
brecciated crustal layer several kilometers thick would significantly increase the
temperature of the lower crust resulting in more rapid relaxation of crustal thickness
variations. If the porosity of a brecciated crust is water saturated, then the effect of such a
layer is greatly reduced. However, if water is present, cooling of the upper crust by
groundwater convection in a deeper impact-fractured crustal layer with modest
permeabilities could reduce lower crustal temperatures enough to explain the preservation
of ancient crustal thickness variations. A cooler lower crust is also possible if solid-state
thermal convection in the mantle is inhibited by a stable compositional stratification
resulting from the fractional solidification of an early magma ocean.

1. Introduction
[2] Analysis of gravity and topography data for Mars
show the presence of lateral crustal thickness variations,
even beneath features of great age [Zuber et al., 2000;
McKenzie et al., 2002; McGovern et al., 2002, 2004].
Variations in the thickness of a uniform density crust cause
lateral pressure gradients that generate flow in a ductile
lower crust. Flow from areas of larger to smaller crustal
thickness evens out the thickness of the crust over time. The
largest scale, and perhaps the longest lived, variation present
is the north-south crustal thickness variation [Zuber et al.,
2000]. At an only slightly smaller scale, the Tharsis rise
appears to be a large center of basaltic volcanism, that began
forming early in the evolution of Mars [Phillips et al.,
2001], with topography supported largely by thickened
crust. Other major topographic features such as large basins,
like Hellas, while apparently younger than the earliest
Tharsis volcanism, also preserve crustal thickness varia-
tions. In this study, we explore the implications that the
survival of such crustal thickness variations would have for
the thermal evolution of Mars.
[3] Previous studies [Zuber et al., 2000] have argued that
the preservation of crustal thickness variations places con-
straints on the thickness of the crust through the temperature
dependence of crustal viscosity. Nimmo and Stevenson
[2001] investigated constraints on crustal thickness using
steady state thermal evolution models which assumed a heat
flux at the base of the crust equal to the radiogenic heat
production in the mantle. With a dry diabase flow law, they
found that crustal thicknesses as large as 100 km would
allow the preservation of crustal thickness variations. Since
the rheology of the lower crust is likely to be very strongly
temperature-dependent, calculated crustal relaxation rates
depend sensitively on both mantle thermal evolution and
crustal rates of heat transfer.

[4] We have formulated thermal evolution models that
include secular cooling as well as radiogenic heating.
These models treat the strong temperature dependence of
mantle flow by thermally activated creep and the presence
of a conductive lid above a convecting interior using the
scaling laws of Grasset and Parmentier [1998]. Our
results [Parmentier and Zuber, 2001, 2002] indicate that
the added heat flux from secular cooling of the core and
mantle results in significantly higher temperatures at the
base of crust. Higher temperatures near the base of the
crust allow more rapid flow in response to crustal thick-
ness variations and more rapid relaxation of these varia-
tions. For initial mantle potential temperatures for
subsolidus cooling in the range of 1500–1800C and a
50-km-thick crust, a dry diabase rheology based on labo-
ratory flow laws allows the preservation of global-scale
crustal thickness variations, except for cases with large
amounts of radioactive heating in the crust. For a wet
crustal rheology significant relaxation of crustal thickness
variations can occur over the first 750 Myr of evolution
(the Noachian epoch).
[5] Lower crustal temperatures may be significantly
affected by the presence of a porous, brecciated, low-
conductivity layer (regolith) and a deeper layer of frac-
tured crust beneath, as has been identified within the Lunar
crust. While the details can be debated, such a layer is
almost certainly present, and its effect has not been included
in earlier studies. If this brecciated layer is dry, thermal
conductivity can be significantly reduced, and layer thick-
nesses exceeding only a kilometer significantly enhances
the relaxation of crustal thickness variations.
[6] With a wet crustal rheology, and especially so with an
impact-brecciated surface layer present, some mechanism is
needed to reduce lower crustal temperatures and so preserve
crustal thickness variations. Two mechanisms are suggested
that can reduce the temperatures of the lower crust, thus
preserving crustal thickness variations without requiring a
crust thinner than that indicated by recent gravity studies
[Neumann et al., 2004]. First, hydrothermal circulation of
groundwater within a fractured upper crust may enhance the
rate of heat transfer, thus reducing the temperature of the
lower crust and enhancing the preservation of ancient
crustal thickness variations. Alternatively, an initial stable
compositional stratification of the mantle [Zaranek and
Parmentier, 2002; Elkins-Tanton et al., 2005a], following
fractional solidification of a magma ocean and subsequent
mantle overturn, may suppress mantle solid-state thermal
convection and fractionate heat sources into the deep
mantle, thus reducing the heat flux to base of the crust.
2. Formulation of Thermal Evolution Models
[7] As in many previous studies, our mantle thermal
evolution models are formulated on the basis of energy
conservation in which the rate of change of thermal energy
in the planetary interior is equated to the difference between
the outward heat flux and the rate of radiogenic heat
production

where Tm is the mantle potential temperature, H is the
volumetric heat production, Rs is the radius of the planet,
and f is the solid-state convective heat flux at the base of a
conductive lid, or lithosphere, of thickness L, as illustrated
in Figure 1. Here r and cp are density and heat capacity,
respectively, with [] indicating the average value for the
planetary interior (see discussion below). Thermally

The base of the conductive lid is defined by the isotherm
Tm  DTc at which the viscosity increases by about 1 order
of magnitude relative to that in the adiabatic, convecting
interior. Then

Thus the temperature at the base of the lithosphere does not
have a fixed value but varies with the mantle potential
temperature. The relationship in (3) is strictly valid only for a
viscosity that varies exponentially with temperature, and an
additional factor that is nearly unity appears for an Arrhenius
temperature dependence [Zaranek and Parmentier, 2004].

where k is the thermal diffusivity, k is the thermal

and Parmentier, 1998].
[8] The thermal structure consists of a convecting, adia-
batically stratified mantle with a thermal boundary layer just
beneath the conductive lid across which heat in the con-
vecting mantle is transferred to the lid. A measure of the
thickness of this boundary layer is defined as the depth at
the temperature extrapolated to depth along the conductive
temperature gradient transporting the heat flux f reaches the

This idealization for convection in a fluid with strongly
temperature-dependent viscosity cooled from above is
consistent with both laboratory [Davaille and Jaupart,
1993] and numerical experiments [e.g., Grasset and
Parmentier, 1998].
[9] The heat flux out of a cooling and perhaps solidifying
core heats the convecting mantle from below. Earlier studies
also treat thermal convection in a fluid with a strongly
temperature-dependent viscosity heated from below
[Solomatov and Moresi, 2000; Reese et al., 1999]. Heating
from below results in a thermal boundary layer at the base
of the mantle, generating plumes which transfer heat
upward into the overlying mantle. As in previous studies,
[e.g., Nimmo and Stevenson, 2000], we assume that the
heating of the mantle by these plumes can be represented
simply by an additional source of volumetric heating.
Recent and ongoing studies [Choblet et al., 1999] of
thermal convection driven by both volumetric heating and
heating from below suggest that this is an excellent approx-
imation. Assuming that the core and mantle cool together
during secular cooling, maintaining a nearly constant tem-
perature difference, the heat flux out of a cooling, solidify-
ing core can be represented by a higher effective volumetric
heat capacity rcp in (1). The bulk heat capacity of the
planet, [rcp] in (1), is taken to be the volume weighed
average of rcp in the mantle and core, using parameter
values listed in Table 1. A mantle and core that cool
together should be a good approximation if the core is a
turbulently convecting liquid. If the core solidifies, then this
approximation is valid only if the secular cooling rate is
slow compared to the conduction time for heat out of the
core. As the core solidifies, the release of latent heat will
result in a higher effective heat capacity. We have not
included the effect of latent heat since this added complex-
ity would only result in a higher effective heat capacity that
would further increase the importance of secular cooling
relative to radioactive heating.
[10] Convective heat transfer given by (4) is applied only
after a suitably defined Rayleigh number attains a critical
value for convective instability. This critical value is deter-
mined from recent scaling relationships for the onset of
convection in a fluid with strongly temperature-dependent
viscosity cooled from above [Zaranek and Parmentier,
2004].
[11] Prior to the onset of convection, the temperature over
the entire depth of the mantle is determined by transient heat

where r is radial distance from the center of the planet.
[12] After the onset of convection, temperatures in the
conductive lid are determined by solutions of (6) in a
conductive lid of thickness L. Solutions in the lid are
determined by prescribing the surface temperature at r = Rs,
and the heat flux on r = Rs  L. With an increase (decrease)
in lid thickness dL over a small time interval dt, material of
heat capacity rcp within the thermal boundary layer of
thickness dc cools (heats) by an amount (DTc /ec)dL.
During the same time interval an amount of heat f dt is
transported to the base of the thermal boundary layer. These
two additions of heat must be balanced by heat conduction

approximated by central finite difference derivatives. Time
derivatives in (1), (5), and (6a) are approximated by simple
forward differences in time, yielding an explicit system of
algebraic equations to calculate Tm and temperatures in the
conductive lid at each new time. The base of the lid at depth
L is allowed to vary continuously between grid points with
the temperature and temperature gradient at the base in (6b)
and (6b) defined by linear extrapolation from values at the
two grid points just above the base of the lid.
[14] Examples of thermal evolution models based on the
above formulation are shown in Figure 2 using values of
physical parameters listed in Table 1. A mantle rheology
with an activation energy Q = 250 kJ/mol and a preexpo-
nential factor that would give a viscosity of 1019 Pa-s at the
temperature of the Earth’s upper mantle (1350C) is
compatible with laboratory-derived flow laws for olivine
[Hirth and Kohlstedt, 1996; Mei and Kohlstedt, 2000].
Higher viscosities have the principal effect of lengthening
the timescale of thermal evolution and reducing the secular
cooling contribution to crustal temperatures.
[15] The distribution of heat-producing elements also
affects temperatures in the crust. In the models presented
here, we assume a bulk concentration of heat-producing
elements in the silicate planet and explore different parti-
tioning of heat production between the mantle and the crust.
Two different abundances of heat producing elements have
been suggested for Mars. The first is essentially chondritic
[McDonough and Sun, 1995; Wanke and Dreibus, 1994]. A
second model [Lodders and Fegley, 1997] has about a three
times higher potassium abundance, and given the short K40
decay time produces about twice the early heating rate.
Hauck and Phillips [2002] provide a concise summary and
discussion of the two heat production models. Given the
highly heterogeneous interior that could result from the
early differentiation of Mars [e.g., Elkins-Tanton et al.,
2005a, 2005b] and therefore large uncertainties in the
relationship of the composition of surface materials to that
of the bulk interior, we have chosen the simple chondritic
model. Models with higher heat production will only
increase lower crustal temperatures and reinforce the con-
clusions of this work. U, Th, and K values adopted in our
models are given in Table 1.
[16] Long-lived radiogenic elements U, Th, and K are
highly incompatible in mantle rocks and will be strongly
partitioned into melt during mantle partial melting. To a first
approximation their concentration in the crust will be the
initial mantle concentration divided by the degree of melt-
ing. If the degree of melting were F, then the fraction
(crustal volume/mantle volume)/F of the mantle would have
melted, and this would be the resulting overall fraction of
heat production in the crust. For F = 10% and a 50 km thick
crust, approximately 50% of the heat production of the
planet would be in the crust. In our models, uniform
concentration of heat producing elements with depth in
the crust is assumed. In the results to follow, the fraction
of heat production in the crust is varied from 0.2 to 0.8.
[17] The physical characteristics of the early Martian
crust are not well constrained by direct observations.
However, the near-surface region of a planet early in its
evolution should be characterized by a brecciated, porous
regolith with a thermal conductivity that may be signifi-
cantly lower than that of deeper crustal rock. The Lunar
Highlands, which are believed to have preserved surface
characteristics dating from the time of significant impact
activity, may be one possible analog for very early Mars.
For the Moon, returned samples in addition to gravity and
seismic data are available to constrain crustal structure.
Warren and Rasmussen [1987] summarized evidence for a
2- to 3-km-thick layer of brecciated, porous rock overlying
a 20- to 25-km-thick layer of fractured rock. They suggested
that the porous layer may be created from a thicker layer of
Figure 2. Mantle potential temperature as a function of
depth and time for thermal models with crustal heating
fractions of 0.2 and 0.8 and an initial temperature of
1500C. Other parameters are given in the text and Table 1.
A smaller crustal heating fraction results in more mantle
heating so that the mantle heats up several hundred C
above its initial temperature. At the higher crustal heating
fraction, the mantle cools monotonically at a rate deter-
mined by thermal convection beneath a conducting lid.

impact ejecta by compaction and annealing at sufficiently
high temperature (and lithostatic pressure). If so, a signif-
icant difference between regoliths of the Moon and Mars
may be that greater lithostatic pressure at a given depth, due
to the higher gravity of Mars, favors a thinner porous layer.
Higher impact velocities due higher gravity would favor a
thicker layer. On the basis of correlations of thermal
conductivity and porosity, Warren and Rasmussen suggest
that the thermal conductivity in the brecciated regolith is
reduced by a factor of 10 from that of intact rock. In the
results to follow, we will consider the effect of layers 1 and
2 km thick in which the thermal conductivity is reduced by
a factor of 10. If the pore space were not empty but filled
with a conducting material, perhaps water or water ice on
Mars, the thermal conductivity would be reduced by a much
smaller factor and would not be less than the conductivity of
the pore-space-filling material, 2.4 W/m-C and 0.6 W/m-C
for liquid water and water ice, respectively.
3. Crustal Flow and Relaxation in Thickness
Variations
[18] Variations in the thickness of a low-density crust
result from topography both at the surface and at the crust-
mantle boundary. Thermally activated creep in the crust and
mantle will allow this topography and its corresponding
crustal thickness variation to relax over time. Earlier studies
[e.g., Solomon et al., 1982] show that topography at the
surface and at the crust-mantle boundary evolve on
two distinct timescales involving two different forms of
deformation. Following relatively rapid, almost vertical,
column-wise isostasy, longer-term horizontal flow reduces
an initially nonuniform crust to the lowest potential energy
state of constant thickness. This flow, illustrated in Figure 1,
is driven by horizontal pressure gradients that result from
isostatically compensated crustal thickness variations. Since
thermally activated creep of crustal rock is strongly tem-
perature-dependent, most of this flow must occur near the
base of the crust where the temperature is highest. For
conditions of interest, the mantle should flow at much lower
rates than the weak crustal layer. A typical velocity profile is
shown in Figure 1.
[19] As illustrated in Figure 3, crustal flow should be well
approximated as locally horizontal viscous flow with a
viscosity that varies with temperature or depth in the crust.
The temperature, T, within the crust at depth z is determined,
on the long timescales of interest, by steady state conductive
transfer of heat to the surface

depending on the surface temperature Ts, the heat flux at the

This assumes a uniform thermal conductivity and does not

[20] Crustal relaxation rate as a function of time for the
thermal evolution models described above, withDD = 10 km
and Dx = 500 km, are shown in Figure 3. Here the wet and
dry diabase flow laws given by Caristan [1982] and
Mackwell et al. [1998], respectively, have been adopted.
Mackwell et al. point out that the Caristan experiments may
have resulted in partial melting of the samples producing an
overly weak rheology. However, the partial melt fraction
seems likely to have been too small to significantly affect
the rheology. The specific mineralogy may be less important
since flow laws for wet quartzite [Hirth et al., 2001] and wet
anorthite [Rybacki and Dresen, 2004] give relaxation rates
of the same order of magnitude as the wet diabase flow law.
[21] If Mars retained water as it accreted, the mantle was
likely to be wet during the early evolution, with significant
amounts of water dissolved in nominally anhydrous mantle
minerals. Water, like heat-producing U, Th, and K, is
relatively incompatible in mantle minerals and would be
strongly partitioned in to the liquid phase during mantle
melting. The lower crust of Mars, as a product of mantle
partial melting, is likely to be enriched in elements incom-
patible in the residual mantle, including water. In a planet
with substantial evidence for the presence of water on the
surface, a wet rheology for the lower crust seems preferred.
However, if water were not retained during accretion but
was added as a ‘‘late veneer’’ [Dreibus and Wanke, 1987],
E02007 PARMENTIER AND ZUBER: EARLY EVOLUTION OF MARS

then the mantle of Mars and crust generated by its partial
melting would be dry. Melt inclusions from the meteorites
that crystallized at some depth contain amphiboles, imply-
ing a significant initial magmatic water content. McSween et
al. [2001] argue from phase equilibrium considerations that
the shergottite parent magmas contained2 wt %water. D/H
ratios in SNC minerals are also significantly below
atmospheric values suggesting the presence of primordial
water [Boctor et al., 2003]. More recently, Medard and
Grove [2006] also argue for petrologically significant
amounts of water in the early Martian mantle. On the basis
of indigenous water contents of the meteorite, Jones [2004]
estimates a much smaller water contents of the mantle
source 350 ppm for Chassigny. Thus no general consen-
sus has emerged on the initial water content of the Martian
mantle. However, distinguishing between petrologically and
rheologically significant water contents is important. Petro-
logically significant amounts of water are at the level of a
Figure 3

few weight percent. In olivine, for example, water signifi-
cantly reduces the flow stress at concentrations of only a
few hundred ppm. Not much water is needed to be rheo-
logically significant.
4. Thermal Evolution and Crustal Relaxation
[22] Potential temperatures calculated from convective
thermal evolution models are shown in Figure 3a for initial
temperatures of 1500 and 1800C as a function of time,
both with a crustal heating fraction of 0.5. For the higher
initial temperature, the mantle cools monotonically initially
at a relatively slow rate while for the lower initial temper-
ature, radioactive heating exceeds secular cooling over the
first several Gyr of evolution and the interior heats up. The
crust-mantle boundary temperature Tcm is also shown for
comparison, with the temperature calculated for a steady
state thermal evolution. Secular cooling of the mantle
contributes significantly to Tcm in both cases, but more for
the higher initial temperature. Relaxation rates for a wet
diabase rheology, also shown for these two cases. A
relaxation rate less than 1017 s1 would be required to
preserve crustal thickness variations produced during the
first 750 Myr. For both cases, the relaxation rate during the
first Gyr is large enough that crustal thickness variations
generated very early in the evolution should relax.
[23] Figure 3b shows interior temperature and relaxation
rates as a function of time for crustal heating fractions 0.2,
0.5, and 0.8, all with a 1500C initial mantle potential
temperature. The crustal heating fraction 0.5 is common to
Figures 3a and 3b. For a low crustal heating fraction (high
mantle heating rate), the interior heats above its initial
temperature while for high crustal heating the interior cools
monotonically. A higher crustal heating fraction results in a
higher relaxation rate. The relaxation rate is given for both
wet and dry diabase rheology. All cases shown in Figures 3b
include a 2-km-thick dry brecciated surface layer in which
the conductivity is reduced by a factor 0.1. The dry
rheology would preserve crustal thickness variation even
in the presence of the 2-km-thick low-conductivity layer,
except for the highest crustal heating. For the wet diabase
rheology crustal thickness variations rapidly relax even for
the lowest crustal heating fraction.
[24] Figure 3c shows relaxation rate for both wet and dry
diabase rheology with a range of low-conductivity layer
thicknesses up to 3 km with several values for the thermal
conductivity reduction. The relaxation rate increases with
increasing thickness or decreasing conductivity of the low-
conductivity layer. The case with no layer would approxi-
mate a brecciated crustal layer in which the pore space is
filled with water ice. The smaller conductivity reduction
(0.3) would represent water-filled pore space. For the wet
rheology, neither case comes close to preserving crustal
thickness variations over the first Gyr For the dry rheology,
a 2-km-thick layer would preserve Noachian age crustal
thickness variations, but a 3-km-thick layer would not.
[25] Figure 3c also shows surface heat flow as a function
of time. The presence of a crustal low-conductivity layer
reduces surface heat flow, but only in the early evolution.
During the early evolution, even in the presence of a low-
conductivity crustal layer, surface heat flow exceeds
60 mW/m2. Studies of the elastic support of topography
[McGovern et al., 2002, 2004], from gravity anomalies
associated with Noachian age topographic features shows
that they are almost indistinguishable from being isostati-
cally supported. Minimum estimates of surface heat flow
inferred from the small amount of elastic support allowed
are as large as 50 mW/m2 [McGovern et al., 2004]
(Table 1), comparable to values calculated in the models
of Figure 3c. However, by the end of the Hesperian or
beginning of the Amazonian (1500 Myr), elastic thick-
nesses appear to require heat flows not larger than about
30 mW/m2. This is lower than values predicted both by the
models in Figure 3c and the nominal model of Hauck and
Phillips [2002, Figure 2d]. This discrepancy needs further
study but may be related to thermal structure of the crust
and upper mantle. The relationship of elastic thickness and
heat flow [e.g., Solomon and Head, 1990] employed by
McGovern et al. was based on a linear thermal gradient
through the lithosphere. Understanding how more realistic
temperature distributions in the crust and uppermost mantle
might affect the elastic thickness–heat flow relationship

denoted by circles and squares, respectively, both with a crustal heating fraction 0.5. Dashed curve on the right shows Tcm
for a steady state thermal model. Relaxation rates <1017 s1 are required to preserve crustal thickness variations for Gyr
timescales. Relaxation rates for a wet diabase rheology and no crustal low-conductivity layer exceed this value even for the
case with cooler initial mantle temperature. Solid curves on the left are for a 273K surface temperature. Dashed curve on
the left shows the relaxation rate with a lower 220K surface temperature. (b) Thermal evolution models with a 1500C

conductivity (brecciated) crustal layer in which the conductivity is reduced to 0.1 that of unfractured crust. Crustal
relaxation rates are significantly enhanced by the presence of the low-conductivity layer, as can be seen by comparing wet
diabase relaxation rates with those given in Figure 3a. Even with a low-conductivity layer, relaxation rates for the dry
diabase rheology are low enough to allow the preservation of crustal thickness variations, except for the high crustal heating
fraction. (c) (left) Relaxation rate and (right) surface heat flow as functions of time for a model with a crustal heating
fraction 0.5, initial temperature 1500C. Relaxation rates are shown for several low-conductivity layer thicknesses and for
both wet and dry rheology. For wet rheology, relaxation rates even allowing higher conductivity in the low-conductivity
layer the would not allow the preservation of topography. For the dry rheology, a low-conductivity layer 2 km thick would
allow the preservation of crustal thickness variations, but a 3-km-thick layer would not. Heat flow on the right is shown for
low-conductivity layer of thicknesses 0 (circles), 1 km (triangles), and 2 km (squares) with conductivity reduced by a factor
0.1 in all cases.

would be of interest but is beyond the scope the present
study.
5. Hydrothermal Cooling of the Crust
[26] A fractured permeable regolith, if water saturated,
could conceivably allow significant hydrothermal convec-
tive cooling of the crust. This possibility is well worth
considering for Mars because the permeability required is
not large and there is good reason to believe that the planet
had significant amounts of water at least in the shallow crust
for much of its geological history. The Martian surface
shows pervasive evidence of Noachian-aged surface water
exhibited in the geology [cf. Carr, 1996], and neutron flux
and gamma-ray maps show evidence for present-day
hydrogen concentrations indicative of substantial water in
the top meter of the subsurface [Feldman et al., 2002;
Mitrofanov et al., 2002]. It has been hypothesized that the
remnants of an early Martian ocean are preserved within the
brecciated crust [Clifford and Parker, 2001], perhaps to
significant depths in the crustal column [Schrag and Zuber,
2003].
[27] A deeper, fractured layer should be present beneath
the brecciated uppermost crust. The porosity of this deeper
fractured layer may be small enough that its thermal
conductivity would not be significantly affected. How-
ever, even small porosity in well-connected fracture systems
with fractures spaced at the meter scale or smaller [see
Hanna and Phillips, 2005] can create significant levels of
permeability. On the Moon, low seismic velocities in the
upper 25 km of the crust [Goins et al., 1981; Khan and
Mosegaard, 2000, 2001] is thought to reflect fractured rock
[Simmons et al., 1973] with a porosity of about 1%. An
impact-fractured layer should also have been present on
Mars, perhaps with a similar porosity to that on the Moon. If
the bottom of such a permeable layer is determined by the
closing of fractures under lithostatic stress, the layer thick-
ness on Mars should be about one third that on the Moon.
While, greater lithostatic pressure would tend to close
fractures in a fractured layer at shallower depths on Mars
than on the Moon, impacting bodies with higher kinetic
energy on Mars could cause fracturing to greater depth, so
that the 20- to 25-km-thick layer of fracturing on the Moon
could extend to even greater depths on Mars. Given
evidence of the important role of groundwater on Mars,
several models for the hydrologic properties of the Martian
crust have been proposed [MacKinnon and Tanaka, 1989;
Clifford, 1993; Hanna and Phillips, 2005]. Hanna and
Phillips [2005] provide a good summary of earlier models.
They also conclude that the permeability of the crust should
be dominated by fractures, with a small permeability due to
impact brecciation. At depths greater than about 4 km,
they estimate a fracture permeability of 1015 m2. They
suggest that the depth to which fractures provide perme-
ability is limited by the brittle-plastic transition and that this
would extend to depths of 20–25 km on Mars. Hydrother-
mally altered minerals may fill cracks, reducing permeabil-
ity. Hydrothermal cooling may thus decrease as the planet
evolves and could be most effective when impacts are
frequent enough to continually generate new fractures.
[28] The rate of hydrothermal cooling is determined by a
Rayleigh number that depends on the product of the
permeability and layer thickness and on the physical prop-
erties of water
Ra ¼ raDTgKDh
mk
: ð14Þ
where r, a, and m are the density, thermal expansion
coefficient, and viscosity of the fluid (water) respectively; k,
K, and Dh are the thermal diffusivity, permeability, and
thickness of the fluid saturated rock layer. The heat flux f
through the permeable layer can be expressed in terms of
the ratio of hydrothermal convective heat transfer to purely
conductive heat flux or Nusselt number, Nu, as
f ¼ Nu k Tb  Ts
Dh
 
; ð15Þ
where Tb is the temperature at the bottom of the layer of
thickness Dh. Laboratory experiments [Elder, 1967] give
Nu ¼ 0:025 Ra; ð16Þ
where in Ra, DT = Tb  Ts. Similar results have been
obtained from numerical experiments [cf. Combarnous,
1978]. With a permeability K  1015 m2, as estimated by
Hanna and Phillips [2005], Tb  Ts  300C, Dh  20 km,
and appropriate values for physical properties of water or
water saturated rock, give Ra  100. Then equation (16)
gives Nu  2–3.
[29] Figure 4 shows the relaxation rate of crustal thick-
ness variations as a function of time for several Nu values
with two layer thicknesses. The mantle thermal evolution
model here with an initial mantle temperature of 1500C
and 0.5 crustal heating fraction corresponds to one of those
shown in Figure 3. The case with Nu = 1 corresponds to no
hydrothermal cooling; and as discussed in the context of
Figure 3, the relaxation rate exceeds 1017 s1 during the
first Gyr of evolution. For Nu = 2 in a permeable layer only
10 km thick, the relaxation rate is small enough to preserve
crustal thickness variations of early Noachian age with the
wet diabase crustal rheology.
[30] An interesting speculation is that hydrothermal alter-
ation may also explain the difference in the intensity of
magnetic anomalies between the southern highlands and
northern plains [cf. Stevenson, 2001; Solomon et al., 2005].
If the same crustal mineralogy is responsible for remnant
magnetization and if hydrothermal alteration extends to the
same depth in both the highlands and the lowland plains,
then thicker crust in the highlands would result in a thicker,
unaltered, still magnetized layer.
6. Stable Stratification of a Differentiated
Mantle
[31] Magma ocean fractional solidification is expected to
generate a highly unstable density stratification [Elkins-
Tanton et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2005a]. Depending on the rate
of thermally activated creep, this will overturn to a strongly
stable stratification in times as short at 1–10 Myr. Decom-
pression melting during this overturn may create an early
crust [Elkins-Tanton et al., 2005b]. The stable stratification
following mantle overturn could be sufficient to suppress
solid-state thermal convection so that the mantle would cool

Figure 4. (left) Crustal relaxation rate with the wet diabase rheology and (right) surface heat flow as
functions of time for a thermal evolution with 1500C initial temperature and 0.5 crustal heating fraction.
The effect of a 10-km-thick hydrothermally cooled layer is shown for hydrothermal Nusselt numbers
(Nu) of 1 (circles), 2 (triangles), and 4 (squares). Dashed curve is for a 20-km-thick layer with Nu = 2.
Hydrothermal cooling with Nu  2–4 in a 10-km-thick layer would allow the preservation of crustal
thickness variations even with the wet diabase rheology. Surface heat flow is not strongly affected by the
presence of a hydrothermally cooled layer.
Figure 5. (left) Crustal relaxation rate for wet diabase rheology and (right) surface heat flow as
functions of time for a model with mantle cooling solely by heat conduction from an initial temperature
1500C with crustal heating fraction 0.5. Cases with a 2-km-thick low-conductivity layer (0.1 of normal
crustal conductivity) and no low-conductivity layer are shown by circles and squares, respectively. The
dashed curves show the case of a differentiated mantle in which mantle radiogenic heat sources do not
contribute to crustal temperatures; see text for more discussion. With a dry brecciated low-conductivity
layer, relaxation rates are too high to allow preservation of crustal thickness variations. A differentiated
mantle reduces relaxation rates, but not sufficiently to preserve crustal thickness variations. The case with
no crustal low-conductivity layer appears to have a low enough relaxation rate to preserve a significant
fraction of late Noachian-aged crustal thickness variations.

at a slower rate controlled by heat conduction. In the
fractional solidification model, mantle heat production
would be concentrated in the last mantle to solidify, which
ends up at the bottom of an overturned mantle. This heating
may eventually lead to thermal convective instability [cf.
Alley and Parmentier, 1998]; but early in the evolution, this
concentration of incompatible elements at depth in a stably
stratified mantle would isolate mantle heat sources from the
crust. Figure 5 shows the consequences of a stable mantle
stratification on crustal relaxation for the case that radio-
genic heat sources remain uniformly distributed in the
mantle and for the case that these heat sources reside at
the bottom of the mantle and do not contribute to crustal
temperatures.
7. Summary
[32] MGS gravity and MOLA topography show that
crustal thickness variations have persisted since the earliest
evolution of planet even though the elastic thickness
beneath early structural/topographic features was small.
Thermal evolution models in which the mantle loses heat
by solid-state thermal convection indicate a significant
contribution of secular mantle cooling to lower crustal
temperatures, with temperatures significantly higher than
for a steady state thermal evolution. The models indicate
that creep in a lower crust with a dry diabase rheology
would be sufficiently slow to allow the preservation of
crustal thickness variations. However, temperatures in the
lower crust are sufficiently high that a wet-diabase rheology
would have allowed crustal thickness variations created in
the Noachian to have relaxed.
[33] The presence of an impact-brecciated crustal layer
with low thermal conductivity, if comparable to that thought
to be present on the Moon, would significantly increase
lower crustal temperatures. With a brecciated crustal layer
comparable to that expected for the Moon (2 km thick),
very rapid relaxation of crustal thickness variations is
predicted. Even a dry diabase rheology does not allow the
preservation of crustal thickness variations if a dry impact-
brecciated layer more than 3 km thick were present. Awater
saturated brecciated layer would have a thermal conductivity
only slightly less than intact rock and would not significantly
increase crustal temperatures.
[34] The cooler crust required to preserve crustal thick-
ness variations for the wet crustal rheology may be a
consequence of (1) a stably stratified mantle that does not
convect thermally and in which heat sources are fractionated
into compositionally dense mantle at depth or (2) hydro-
thermal heat transfer in the a fractured portion of the upper
crust. A conductively cooling differentiated mantle would
allow the preservation of crustal thickness variations so long
as the brecciated low-conductivity layer were thin, probably
less than 1 km. Hydrothermal cooling of the upper 10 km of
the crust can explain both preservation of crustal thickness
variations and the inferred elastic thickness, so long as
convective heat transfer rates are not too large.
