ABSTRACT.   Macrophage infiltration of white adipose tissue (WAT) is implicated in the 
metabolic complications of obesity.  The precipitating event(s) and function(s) of macrophage 
infiltration into WAT are unknown.  We demonstrate that >90% of all macrophages in WAT of 
obese mice and humans are localized to dead adipocytes, where they fuse to form syncitia that 
sequester and scavenge  the residual “free” adipocyte lipid droplet and ultimately form 
multinucleate giant cells, a hallmark of chronic inflammation.  Adipocyte death increases in 
obese (db/db) mice (30-fold) and humans and exhibits ultrastructural features of necrosis (but 
not apoptosis).  These observations identify necrotic-like adipocyte death as a pathologic 
hallmark of obesity and suggest that scavenging of adipocyte debris is an important function of 
WAT macrophages in obese individuals.  The frequency of adipocyte death is positively 
correlated with increased adipocyte size in obese mice and humans and in hormone sensitive 
lipase-deficient (HSL-/-) mice, a model of adipocyte hypertrophy without increased adipose 
mass.  WAT of HSL-/- mice exhibited 15-fold increase in necrotic- like adipocyte death and 
formation of macrophage syncitia, coincident with elevated TNF-α gene expression. These 
results provide a novel framework for understanding macrophage recruitment, function and 
persistence in WAT of obese individuals.  
Key Words:  obesity, macrophage, inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis, adipocyte hypertrophy, 
multinucleate giant cell, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes.

INTRODUCTION.   Adipose tissue inflammation is now recognized as an important early 
event in the development of obesity complications, especially type 2 diabetes (1-7).  Recent 
studies suggest that adipose tissue inflammation is due in large part to the pro-inflammatory 
actions of bone marrow-derived WAT macrophages.  These studies demonstrate that 1) 
macrophage numbers and/or macrophage inflammatory gene expression in WAT are positively 
correlated with adipocyte size and BMI in mice and negatively correlated with weight loss in 
obese humans (1, 5, 8); 2) macrophages are the predominant source of TNF-α and a significant 
source of IL-6 and NO in WAT of obese (ob/ob, db/db) mice and humans (2, 5, 7, 9); 3) a 
“spike” in macrophage inflammatory gene expression in WAT immediately precedes or is 
coincident with  the onset of hyperinsulinemia in murine diet- induced obesity (7); and 4) obese 
mice with genetically ablated macrophage inflammatory (i.e., NF-κB) signaling are protected 
from insulin resistance (10).  Together, these observations implicate macrophage activation in 
the development of obesity-associated WAT inflammation and insulin resistance. 
 Despite these advances, we have yet to elucidate the underlying cause and function of 
macrophage infiltration into WAT of obese subjects.  Macrophages are monocytic phagocytes 
that function in innate immunity and wound-healing by sequestering and clearing pathogens, 
dead cells and cell debris in an activation-dependent manner (11).  Macrophage activation 
consists of biochemical, morphological and functional changes that result in the secretion of 
preformed and/or newly-synthesized constituents, such as cytokines and chemokines.  These, 
in turn, switch on the inflammatory response (11).  Macrophage activation at sites of 
inflammation is typically transient, giving way to repair processes that re-establish local tissue 
function.  However, at sites of resistant infectious agents (i.e. tuberculosis) or poorly 
biodegradable tissue irritants (i.e. foreign bodies), macrophages remain activated and fuse to 
form multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) that can persist for weeks or months surrounding the 
unresolved site.  At these sites, MGCs actively phagocytose debris and can acutely produce

pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1α, TNF- α) until the insult is either cleared by phagocytosis 
or encapsulated (12).  
 MGCs have been reported surrounding individual adipocytes in WAT of obese (but not 
lean) mice and humans (1, 5, 7), suggesting that in the obese state, individual adipocytes 
become focal and persistent sites of macrophage activation.  Macrophage infiltration and MGC 
formation in adipose tissue are also observed in conjunction with adipocyte (“fat”) necrosis, 
which occurs in various human diseases (i.e. Weber-Christian disease, Rothmann-Makai 
syndrome, pancreatic panniculitis) (13) and follows failure of autologous adipose implants (14).  
These observations suggest the potential involvement of adipocyte cell death in macrophage 
recruitment and activation in WAT of obese individuals.  
 The present work demonstrates that 1) the overwhelming predominance (>90%) of WAT 
macrophages in obese mice and humans are localized selectively to sites of necrotic-like 
adipocyte death, where they form syncitia that sequester and ingest adipocyte debris, in 
particular the residual lipid droplet, and 2) the frequency of adipocyte death is dramatically 
elevated in obese mice and humans and in a mouse model of adipocyte hypertrophy without 
obesity.  These results identify adipocyte death as an important modulator of obesity-associated 
macrophage responses in WAT.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Mice.  All animal procedures were in accordance with National Institute of Medical Research 
(INSERM) guidelines.  db/db and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Italy at five 
weeks of age and used for experimental procedures at 12 weeks of age.  Mice were individually 
caged and maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with free access to standard pellet food 
(Harlan, Italy) and water.  Obese male db/db mice (n=5), and lean wild-type (C57BL/6) control 
mice (n=5) were used to investigate obesity- associated adipocyte necrosis.  The generation of 
HSL-/- mice has been previously described (15).  HSL-/- mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 
mice for 8 generations and used at 8 weeks of age for gene expression analysis and 12 weeks 
of age for histological analysis. 
 
Human adipose tissue.  Fat biopsies were obtained from male (n = 12) and female (n = 9) 
patients aged 44.7 ± 16.2 (mean ± SD) years undergoing institutionally approved elective 
surgery at Ancona General Hospital (Ancona, Italy).  Fully informed and written consent was 
obtained in all cases.  The subjects did not suffer from any ongoing disease (infection or cancer).  
A total of 28 human biopsies from subcutaneous (abdominal and gluteal) and visceral (omental)  
depots were examined from 12 obese patients (BMI ≥30, 5 male, 7 female), 2 overweight 
patients (BMI 25-29.9, 1 male, 1 female), and 7 lean subjects (BMI 20-24.9, 5 male, 2 female).  
Mean (± SD) BMI of male subjects (31.3 ± 8.7) was not significantly different from mean BMI of 
female subjects (35.1 ± 9.1) (p = 0.39).  
 
Light microscopy.  Mice were sacrificed in the fed state with an overdose of anesthetic 
(xilazine-ketamine) and immediately perfused with a 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate 
buffer, pH7.4 for 2-5 min.  Subcutaneous and visceral WAT depots were dissected under a

Zeiss OPI1 surgical microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and assessed by light microscopy, 
transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and morphometry.  The following 
WAT depots were examined: subcutaneous (inguinal) and visceral (perivesicular) WAT depots 
in db/db and lean control mice and visceral (perirenal) depots in HSL-/- and HSL+/+ mice.  After 
dissection, WAT depots were further fixed by immersion in the perfusion fixative (overnight, 
4°C), dehydrated, cleared and then embedded in paraffin.  Five µm-thick serial sections were 
obtained, the first stained by haematoxylin/eosin to assess morphology, the following processed 
for immunohistochemistry (see below). 
 
Electron Microscopy.  Small fragments of tissue were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde-2% 
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 4 h, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide 
and embedded in an Epon-Araldite mixture.  Semi-thin sections (2 µm) were stained with 
toluidine blue, and thin sections were obtained with an MT-X ultratome (RMC, Tucson, Arizona), 
stained with lead citrate and examined with a CM10 transmission electron microscope (Philips, 
Eindhoven, Netherlands). 
 
Immunohistochemistry.  Immunohistochemistry was performed on de-waxed 5 µm serial 
sections, using 3% hydrogen peroxide to inactivate endogenous peroxidases followed by 
normal goat or horse serum to reduce non-specific staining.  Consecutive serial sections were 
incubated overnight (4°C) with the following primary antibodies: anti-MAC-2/galectin-3 (1:3800, 
Cedarlane Laboratories), anti-mouse F4/80 (1:100, Serotec, Oxford), anti-perilipin (“PREK” 
1:300) (16) , anti-S-100B (1:250, Dako, Denmark), and a polyclonal antibody raised against a C- 
terminal peptide (TEVKNKASLKVQQEVKAQ) of mouse ADRP (1:100).  Primary antibody was 
omitted from negative controls.  Appropriate positive controls where also used to test specificity 
of all antibodies.  Biotinylated, HRP-conjugated second antibodies included goat anti-rabbit IgG 
(ADRP-C; PREK; S100B), rat anti-goat IgG (F4/80) and horse anti-mouse IgG (MAC2/galectin-

3) (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA).  Histochemical reactions were performed using the 
Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Labs) and Sigma Fast 3,3’-diaminobenzidine as substrate (Sigma, 
St Louis, MO).  Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin.   
 
Morphometry.  Tissue sections were observed under a Nikon Eclipse E800 light microscope 
using an x20 objective, and digital images were captured with a DXM 1200 camera.  CLS 
density (CLS per 400 adipocytes), adipocyte surface area and adipocyte volume were 
determined using a drawing tablet and the Nikon Lucia IMAGE Version 4.61 morphometric 
program.  The mean cell volume was derived from the mean surface area and, positing that 
adipose cell density is the same as trioline (0.915 µg/µL), mean cell weight (µg lipid per cell) 
was mathematically derived from mean cell volume (17). 
 
Gene expression analysis.  Total WAT RNA was extracted from frozen perirenal fat of 2 
month-old male wild type or HSL-/- mice using RNeasy Lipid Tissue kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, 
ON).  Total bone marrow macrophage RNA was extracted after washing in 5 ml PBS and direct 
lysis of confluent cells in the Petri dish, following the manufacturer’s protocol (RNeasy kit, 
Qiagen).  RNA served as template for first strand synthesis using poly dT primers and 
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON).  For quantitative real-time PCR 
(SmartCycler, Cepheid), we used the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Quiagen).  Primer sets 
used were: Mac-2a (5’ATGAAGAACCTCCGGGAAAT 3’, 3’ GCTTAGA TCATGGCGTGGTT 5’), 
TNF-α (5’CCA GTGTGGGAAGCTGTCTT3’, 3’AAGCAAAAGAGGAGGCAACA 5’) and β-actin 
(5’CGTTGACATCCGTAAAGACCT3’, 3’GCAGTAATCTCCTTCTGCATCC 5’).  Each reaction 
yielded amplicons of ~100 base pairs.  PCR conditions were: 15 sec, 94ºC; 20 sec, 60ºC and 20 
sec, 72ºC, for 45 cycles.  After amplification, a melting curve (0.01°C/sec) was used to confirm 
product purity.  Results are expressed relative to β-actin.

RESULTS  
 WAT macrophages localize almost exclusively to sites of necrotic-like adipocyte death 
in obese db/db mice and in obese humans.  We initially assessed the frequency and 
distribution of mature  macrophages in fixed WAT of lean (wild-type) and obese db/db mice, an 
established model of obesity-associated WAT inflammation (7). Macrophages were identified 
based on immunoreactivity for both F4/80 (not shown) and MAC-2 (also known as galectin 3), a 
lectin expressed by activated macrophages that mediates macrophage phagocytic and 
inflammatory responses (18-20).  Surprisingly, macrophages were non-randomly distributed in 
WAT of both lean and obese mice.  Rather than being dispersed throughout the tissue, 
macrophages were instead aggregated in “crown-like structures” (CLS), which contained up to 
15 macrophages surrounding what appeared to be individual adipocytes (Fig. 1).  CLS 
formation was a rare event in lean wild-type mice (0.34 ± 0.28 CLS per 100 adipocytes) (Fig. 
1A), but increased ~30-fold (10.50 ± 1.05 CLS per 100 adipocytes) in obese db/db mice (p < 
0.001) (Fig. 1B).  Notably, the preponderance of MAC-2 positive macrophages in WAT of lean 
wild-type and obese db/db mice were localized to CLS (lean: 82.3 ± 5.3%; obese: 90.6 ± 1.8% 
[mean ± SD]).  CLS contained only an occasional (<1%) neutrophil or lymphocyte and no 
preadipocytes, based on EM morphology (21) and absence of immunoreactivity for the 
preadipocyte marker S-100B  (22, 23) (data not shown).  CLS macrophages formed MAC-2 
positive multinucleate giant cells (MGCs) (Fig. 1 C,D),  indicating that individual adipocytes 
were acting as chronic sites of macrophage activation (12, 24).  Together, these observations 
demonstrate that 1) the vast majority of WAT macrophages are aggregated in CLS that form 
around individual adipocytes and 2) the number of such “inflammatory” adipocytes increases 
dramatically in obese db/db mice. 
  We next used electron microscopy to examine ultrastructural features of those 
adipocytes that were surrounded by CLS.  Remarkably, in all visceral and subcutaneous WAT 
depots of multiple obese mice, CLS were localized exclusively to dead adipocytes (Fig. 2A).

Adipocyte death in obese db/db mice exhibited none of the classical ultrastructural features of 
apoptosis- i.e, chromatin condensation, plasma membrane blebbing (zeiosis) or membrane-
bound apoptotic bodies with nuclear fragments (25-27) (Fig. 2A,B).  However, in all instances, 
obesity-associated adipocyte death exhibited features of necrosis, including ruptured plasma 
membranes, dilated ER, cell debris in the extracellular space, and the appearance of small lipid 
droplets in the cytoplasm (26-29) (Fig. 2A,B).  Disrupted plasma membranes, small cytoplasmic 
lipid droplets and interstitial cell debris were recently noted as in vivo features of experimentally- 
induced adipocyte necrosis in mice (26).  We also detected degenerating adipocytes that were 
not surrounded by CLS macrophages (Fig. 2B), indicating that sequestration of adipocytes 
within CLS is secondary to adipocyte demise.  These adipocytes exhibited ultrastructural 
features of necrosis (i.e. ruptured basal membranes, organelle degeneration and small 
cytoplasmic lipid droplets) but no detectable features of apoptosis (Fig. 2B).   
 The appearance of small cytoplasmic lipid droplets suggested that the unilocular 
adipocyte lipid droplet degenerated during the process of obesity-associated adipocyte death.  
Lipid droplet degeneration was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the essential lipid 
droplet-associated protein, perilipin, a key regulator of adipocyte lipolysis (Fig. 2C,D) (16, 30).  
No perilipin immunoreactivity was detected on lipid droplets of adipocytes surrounded by CLS 
(Fig. 2D).  In contrast, perilipin was detected in adjacent, viable adipocytes (Fig. 2C, D).  These 
results confirm that nonviable adipocytes are foci of macrophage localization and syncitia 
formation in WAT of obese db/db mice.  In conjunction with ultrastructural studies of obesity-
associated adipocyte death and CLS formation (Fig. 2A, B), these observations tell us that each 
CLS designates a site of necrotic-like adipocyte death.  Given that >90% of macrophages in 
WAT of obese db/db mice are present in CLS (Fig. 1B), our results additionally demonstrate 
that the preponderance of macrophages in WAT of obese mice are selectively localized to 
individual dead adipocytes.

 CLS macrophages persist at sites of obesity- associated adipocyte death to scavenge 
the exposed “free” lipid in the interstitium (Fig. 2A, E).  The scavenging of “free” lipid by CLS 
macrophages is likely to be a protective response, at least initially (see Discussion).  
Internalization of adipocyte lipid (or its re-esterified derivatives) is associated with lipid droplet 
formation and intense macrophage immunoreactivity for adipocyte differentiation-related protein 
(ADRP) (Fig. 2E), a lipid droplet- associated protein that increases in cells in response to the 
accumulation of neutral lipid (31). Upregulated ADRP expression in CLS macrophages provides 
one explanation for the previous report of upregulated ADRP gene expression in WAT of obese 
db/db mice (7). The persistence of lipid-scavenging macrophages and the formation of MGCs at 
“free” lipid droplets of dead adipocytes (Fig. 1C, D) suggest that these droplets act as chronic 
sites of macrophage activation in WAT.  However, we currently do not know if or how 
scavenging of adipocyte lipid and/or MGC formation by WAT macrophages promotes or 
prolongs the pro-inflammatory macrophage gene expression that characterizes obesity and its 
complications (5, 7). 
 We next investigated the relationship between WAT macrophage localization and 
obesity-associated adipocyte death in human subjects.  We used CLS formation around 
perilipin-negative adipocytes as a marker of adipocyte death (Fig. 3A-D) and electron 
microscopy to assess necrotic and apoptotic features (Fig. 3E).  As in db/db mice, CLS present 
in human WAT were localized exclusively to degenerate adipocytes, based on the absence of 
perilipin staining (Fig. 3 B, D).  Again, adipocyte death exhibited only necrotic features, 
including plasma membrane rupture, presence of numerous small lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, 
and dilated endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Fig. 3E). 
 Adipocyte death in human subjects was positively correlated with obesity, with adipocyte 
death detected in 13 of 19 biopsies from obese subjects (BMI >30-45), but in only 2 of 9 
biopsies from lean or overweight individuals (BMI <30) (p = 0.04, Fisher Exact Test).  Adipocyte 
death was also correlated with mean (± SD) adipocyte size, which increases in obesity (see

below).  Adipocyte size in biopsies containing one or more dead adipocytes (0.37 ± 0.08 µg lipid 
per cell, n = 15) was twice that of biopsies containing no dead adipocytes (0.17 ± 0.09 µg lipid, n 
= 13) (p < 0.001).  This association was observed in both subcutaneous and visceral WAT 
depots (Fig. 3F).  Interestingly, adipocyte death was detected in a lean subject (BMI = 24) with 
large adipocytes (average = 0.40 µg lipid per cell), whereas no dead adipocytes were detected 
in an obese subject (BMI = 34) with relatively small adipocytes (average = 0.23 µg lipid per cell).  
These observations suggest that rates of adipocyte death increase as adipocytes enlarge. 
 
Adipocyte hypertrophy in the absence of obesity is associated with necrotic-like 
adipocyte death and CLS formation.  Increases in WAT mass reflect adipocyte hypertrophy, 
adipocyte hyperplasia or both (32).  The correlation of adipocyte death with adipocyte size in 
humans (above) and associations of adipocyte hypertrophy with dysregulated adipocyte 
metabolism and elevated adipocyte stress (1, 5, 33, 34) suggested that adipocyte hypertrophy 
might promote obesity-associated adipocyte death.  To test this hypothesis, we assessed the 
frequency of adipocyte death and CLS formation in hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) knockout 
mice (HSL-/- mice).  HSL is a major lipase in mature adipocytes, and HSL abrogation results in 
increased adipocyte lipid storage and thus, adipocyte hypertrophy.  Adipocyte hypertrophy in 
HSL-/- mice is not associated with increased adipose mass (15, 35-37).  Thus, HSL-/- mice 
provide a genetic model with which to examine the association of adipocyte hypertrophy and 
adipocyte death in the absence of obesity. 
 In the present study, mean cell size of viable (perilipin-positive) adipocytes in HSL-/- 
mice (0.51 ±  0.14 µg lipid per cell) was >3-fold that of wild-type controls (0.15  ±  0.05 µg lipid 
per cell) (p < 0.001).  As early as eight weeks of age, increased adipocyte size in HSL-/- mice 
was associated with macrophage infiltration and inflammation, manifested as elevated levels of 
transcripts for MAC-2 (7-fold) and TNF-α (5-fold) in perirenal WAT (p ≤ 0.05) (Table 1; see also

31).  TNF-α gene expression was not elevated in HSL-/- macrophages that were differentiated 
in vitro from bone marrow-derived precursors (data not shown).  Thus, elevated TNF-α gene 
expression is not an intrinsic property of non-activated macrophages in HSL-/- mice.  These 
data indicate that adipocyte hypertrophy in HSL-/- mice is coincident with macrophage 
recruitment and activation, and with WAT inflammation in the absence of increased adipose 
mass. 
  As in obese db/db mice and obese humans, the overwhelming preponderance (98 ± 
0.7%) of macrophages (F4/80, MAC-2 positive cells) in WAT of lean HSL-/- mice were 
aggregated in CLS that selectively surrounded nonviable (perilipin-negative) adipocytes (Fig. 4 
A).  By 12 weeks of age, the frequency of adipocyte death (CLS formation around perilipin- 
negative adipocytes) in WAT of HSL-/- mice was ~15-fold greater (29.0 ±  2.0 CLS per 100 
adipocytes) than the frequency of adipocyte death in wild-type controls (2.0  ±  0.4 CLS per 100 
adipocytes).  Adipocyte death in lean HSL-/- mice exhibited ultrastructural features of necrosis, 
including basal membrane rupture and ER dilatation (Fig. 4B).  As observed in WAT of obese 
mice and humans (Figs. 2 C, D and Fig. 3E), lipid droplet degeneration was a characteristic 
early feature of adipocyte death in HSL-/- mice (Fig. 4B).  Moreover, as with adipocyte death in 
obese mice and humans, we detected no chromatin or nuclear condensation (Fig. 4B), 
consistent with a previous report that the frequency of apoptotic (i.e., TUNEL- positive) cells is 
not increased in WAT of HSL-/- mice (37).  CLS macrophages in WAT of HSL-/- mice actively 
ingested exposed adipocyte lipid (Fig. 4C), elaborated numerous lipid droplets, and expressed 
intense ADRP immunoreactivity (Fig. 4D).  Thus, adipocyte hypertrophy in the absence of 
increased adipose mass is associated with 1) increased rates of necrotic-like adipocyte death, 
2) selective macrophage recruitment to sites of adipocyte death and 3) formation of lipid-
scavenging macrophage syncitia around “free” adipocyte lipid droplets.  This is identical to 
events observed in WAT of obese mice and humans (Figs. 1-3).

DISCUSSION 
       Bone marrow-derived macrophages accumulate in WAT of obese mice and humans, where 
they promote adipose and systemic inflammation and the development of obesity-related 
metabolic complications (5, 7, 38).  However, neither the underlying cause nor the function of 
macrophage recruitment in WAT of obese subjects is known.  In the present study we 
demonstrate that 1) the preponderance of WAT macrophages in lean and obese mice and 
humans is localized to individual dead adipocytes, 2) at these sites, macrophages express 
activation markers (MAC-2), form syncitia (CLS) that surround and scavenge residual adipocyte 
lipid, and ultimately form multinucleate giant cells, a hallmark of chronic inflammatory states, 
and 3) the frequency of adipocyte death is increased >30-fold in a mouse (db/db) model of 
obesity- associated WAT inflammation (7) as well as in obese  humans (BMI > 30).  These 
observations suggest that adipocyte death promotes macrophage recruitment, accumulation 
and persistence in WAT of obese individuals.  
 The mechanism of adipocyte death has potentially significant implications for the 
development of obesity- associated WAT inflammation.  Broadly speaking, apoptosis is non-
inflammatory, reflecting the packaging of cell constituents into inflammation- suppressive 
apoptotic bodies (26, 27, 39).  In contrast, during necrosis, cell contents are released into the 
extracellular space where they evoke inflammatory responses (27, 39, 40).  Electron 
microscopy is the most reliable technique for assessing classical apoptosis, which is defined by 
stereotypic morphological changes, including chromatin condensation, plasma membrane 
blebbing and the formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies containing nuclear fragments 
(26, 27, 39).  In the present study, obesity-associated adipocyte death exhibited none of these 
apoptotic hallmarks.  Rather, moribund and dead adipocytes invariably displayed features of 
necrosis, most notably, rupture of the plasma membrane (Figs. 2A,B and 4B), dilatation of the 
endoplasmic reticulum (Figs. 3E and 4B) and release of cell contents to the extracellular space

(Fig. 2A) (26, 27, 40).  These observations suggest that obesity-associated adipocyte death 
occurs by necrosis.   
 Arguing against this conclusion and supporting an apoptotic mechanism of obesity-
associated adipocyte death is the relative absence of neutrophils at sites of adipocyte death 
(present study) and in adipose tissue of obese mice and humans (7).  Whereas apoptosis can 
activate macrophages without the participation of other pro-inflammatory cells (i.e. neutrophils), 
the inflammatory response to necrosis is typically a sequential process in which neutrophils 
initially participate.  Neutrophil infiltration into WAT is observed in response to adipocyte 
necrosis in human pathologic conditions as well as acutely in response to experimentally-
induced adipocyte necrosis in mice (13, 14, 29, 41). Thus, obesity-associated adipocyte death 
appears to occur by an alternative death pathway sharing features of both necrosis and 
apoptosis.  A number of such alternative death pathways (e.g., “necrosis-like programmed cell 
death”, “paraptosis” ) have recently been described in which apoptotic signaling pathways and 
proteolytic cascades may participate, but the morphology of cell execution is predominantly 
necrotic (27, 40). These necrosis- like forms of apoptotic death typically lack chromatin 
condensation and apoptotic bodies (as in the present study).  A critical unresolved question is 
whether this alternative pathway of adipocyte death promotes pro-inflammatory activation of 
CLS macrophages and MGCs, thereby contributing to the chronic pro-inflammatory tone in WAT 
of obese individuals (5, 7). 
 The development of obesity is associated with release by adipocytes of macrophage 
chemoattractants, arrestants and activators (5, 38, 42, 43).  Elevated release of these 
substances by metabolically dysregulated or otherwise “distressed” adipocytes or by adjacent 
cells could provide one mechanism to account for the preferential localization of WAT 
macrophages to dead adipocytes.  However, it is conceivable that events unrelated to obesity- 
associated  adipocyte death induce initial macrophage extravasation from the blood into WAT, 
and that these macrophages are subsequently recruited to moribund adipocytes.  Irrespective of

the factors promoting initial macrophage recruitment to WAT, the relative paucity of 
macrophages that were not localized to dead adipocytes in the present study suggests that 
macrophages are recruited to degenerating or dead adipocytes soon after extravasation into 
WAT.  
 Our data for human subjects and for HSL-/- mouse model of adipocyte hypertrophy 
without obesity suggest that adipocyte hypertrophy per se promotes adipocyte death, 
macrophage aggregation and CLS formation.  Therefore, hypertrophy-induced adipocyte death 
is a plausible mechanism underlying the reported association between mean adipocyte size and 
the magnitude of macrophage infiltration and inflammatory gene expression in WAT (7).  In 
addition, the association between adipocyte size and adipocyte death provides a potential 
explanation for the fact that, during the development of obesity, adipocytes get only “so large,” 
after which adipocyte hypertrophy gives way to adipocyte hyperplasia (32).  The present study 
suggests that the initial hypertrophic response of adipocytes renders them prone to necrotic-like 
death, after which only adipocyte hyperplasia can efficiently maintain or increase the lipid 
storage capacity of adipose tissue.  
 The mechanism(s) by which hypertrophy potentially promotes adipocyte death is unclear, 
but cell stress is implicated.  Hypertrophic adipocytes are subjected to multiple cytotoxic 
stressors, including ER stress, hypoxia, elevated TNF-α, reactive oxygen species, and free fatty 
acids (1, 4, 33, 34, 44, 45).  These cytotoxic stresses activate inflammatory signaling cascades 
that regulate stress-induced cell death (46, 47) and downregulate adipocyte insulin signaling 
and PPARγ-regulated gene expression (34, 48, 49).  Interestingly, experimental depletion of 
systemic insulin levels or targeted disruption of PPARγ gene expression in mature adipocytes 
has been shown to induce adipocyte necrosis and subsequent inflammatory cell infiltration in 
mouse WAT (29, 41).  Thus, compromised insulin signaling and/or downregulated expression of 
PPARγ-regulated genes in hypertrophic adipocytes may contribute to obesity- associated 
adipocyte death.  Stress-induced mechanisms of adipocyte death may be complemented and

locally amplified by cytotoxins released from activated WAT macrophages (i.e., TNF-α, NO, 
reactive oxygen species).  Thus, WAT macrophages could conceivably participate in adipocyte 
“execution”(7), thereby contributing to a feed-forward mechanism of adipocyte death and 
macrophage recruitment. 
 MAC-2 expression in CLS macrophages and MGCs is consistent with the lectin’s roles in 
leukocyte recruitment, phagocytosis, lipid scavenging, and inflammatory progression (18-20, 50, 
51).  MAC-2 expression at sites of adipocyte necrosis may be functionally linked to macrophage 
aggregation and CLS formation, as MAC-2 is a potent macrophage chemoattractant that 
promotes macrophage aggregation (19).  MAC-2 also possesses anti-apoptotic activity that is 
implicated in macrophage survival at sites of inflammation (51).  The chemoattractant and anti-
apoptotic activities of MAC-2 are likely to facilitate and prolong macrophage recruitment, 
aggregation and function at sites of adipocyte death.    
 Clearance of “free” lipid appears to be an important function of MAC-2-expressing 
macrophages in WAT (present study) as well as in the arterial wall (52) and in the regenerating 
peripheral nervous system following injury (53).  In WAT, “free” lipid droplets released from 
necrotic adipocytes must be sequestered and removed from the interstitium, since they are 
insoluble and provide an unprotected source of cholesterol and cytotoxic fatty acids that could 
damage WAT cells (44, 54, 55).  In addition, clearance of “free” lipid (and other adipocyte 
debris) must precede remodeling of the extracellular matrix and the recruitment of adipocyte 
precursors required for new fat cell differentiation at sites of adipocyte loss (56).  This and other 
remodeling functions of WAT macrophages (11) may be particularly important in maintaining 
and expanding the lipid storage capacity of obese individuals despite dramatically- increased 
rates of adipocyte death.  However, it is currently undetermined if and how lipid-laden 
macrophage syncitia are “cleared” from WAT to make room for new adipocytes.      
 In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that 1) the preponderance of 
macrophages in WAT of lean and obese mice and humans is selectively localized to dead

adipocytes;  2) rates of adipocyte death increase dramatically in obesity, potentially reflecting 
cytotoxic effects of adipocyte hypertrophy; 3) obesity-associated adipocyte death appears to 
involve an alternative death pathway exhibiting morphological features of necrosis and the 
leukocyte- eliciting profile of apoptosis; 4) “free” lipid droplets of dead adipocytes act as 
persistent sites of macrophage fusion, lipid uptake and MGC formation.  These observations 
provide a novel framework for understanding macrophage recruitment and function in WAT and 
for elucidating underlying causes of obesity-associated WAT inflammation.

droplets (FL) in the interstitium.  The absence of chromatin or nuclear condensation suggests 
degeneration in the absence of “classical” apoptosis.  M, macrophage; L, adipocyte lipid droplet.  
(C) High power electron micrograph showing internalization of free lipid (FL) derived from the 
degenerating adipocyte lipid droplet (L) by CLS macrophage (M).  (D) CLS macrophages of 
HSL-/- mice elaborate numerous intracellular lipid droplets and are intensely immunoreactive for 
the lipid droplet- associated protein, ADRP.  Bar length: panel A = 36 µm; B = 1.25 µm; C = 0.45 
µm; D = 15 µm.

Table 1. Evidence of macrophage infiltration and inflammatory activation in WAT of HSL-
/- mice.  Relative levels of MAC-2 and TNF-α mRNA in HSL-/- and HSL+/+ mice were 
determined by real-time PCR of perirenal WAT from 2 month- old male mice (n = 6) of each 
genotype.  Gene expression is expressed relative to that measured for beta-actin (see Materials 
and Methods).  Ratios comparing HSL-/- and HSL+/+ mice are shown.
