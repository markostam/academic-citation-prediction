ABSTRACT
Mammalian G9a is a histone H3 Lys-9 (H3–K9)
methyltransferase localized in euchromatin and
acts as a co-regulator for specific transcription
factors. G9a is required for proper development in
mammals as g9a/g9a mice show growth retar-
dation and early lethality. Here we describe the
cloning, the biochemical and genetical analyses of
the Drosophila homolog dG9a. We show that dG9a
shares the structural organization of mammalian
G9a, and that it is a multi-catalytic histone methyl-
transferase with specificity not only for lysines 9
and 27 on H3 but also for H4. Surprisingly, it is not
the H4–K20 residue that is the target for this methy-
lation. Spatiotemporal expression analyses reveal
that dG9a is abundantly expressed in the gonads
of both sexes, with no detectable expression in
gonadectomized adults. In addition we find a low
but clearly observable level of dG9a transcript in
developing embryos, larvae and pupae. Genetic and
RNAi experiments reveal that dG9a is involved in
ecdysone regulatory pathways.
INTRODUCTION
Modifications of histones are an important mark for transcrip-
tional regulation during embryonic development. The pro-
truding tales of the histones are modified by acetylation,
phosphorylation, ubiquitination and arginine and lysine
methylation, and the combinations are hypothesized to form
a histone code (1,2). The best-characterized substrates for
lysine methylation in eukaryotic cells are histone proteins,
although methylation of several non-histone proteins, such
as the tumor suppressor p53, has been reported as well (3).
Histone H3 has been shown to be methylated on lysine
residues K4, K9, K27, K36 and K79 whereas in histone
H4, K20 is methylated (4,5). Each of these lysine side chains
can be mono-, di- or tri-methylated by histone lysine methyl-
transferases (HKMTases), which, except for Dot1 (6), carry a
catalytic SET [Su(var), Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax] domain
(7). The SET domain is a conserved 130 amino acid
sequence, which is flanked by the less conserved pre-SET
and post-SET regions at the amino and C-termini, respec-
tively. The specificity of a HKMTase, as well as the number
of methyl residues that attaches to a lysine residue, depends
on the structure of the HKMTase or the presence of additional
co-factor proteins (8). On the other hand Ezh2 requires the
presence of the co-factors suppressor of zeste-12 (SUZ12)
and embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) for tri-
methylation of H3–K27 (9). The HKMTase ERG-associated
protein (ESET) di-methylates H3–K9, but is converted into
a tri-methylating enzyme by its association with a mouse-
activating transcription-factor-associated modulator (mAM)
(10). The methylated histones recruit proteins that carry
CHROMO, TUDOR or WD40 domains and are capable of
specific interactions with differently methylated lysine resi-
dues reviewed in Ref. (11). This recruitment step is likely
to define a unique functional readout for individual lysine
methylations. Thus, tri-methylation of lysine 9 in histone
H3 by Suv39H1 and Suv39H2 creates a binding site for the
chromodomain-containing heterochromatic protein HP1
which is thought to induce heterochromatin formation (12).
Di-methylation of H3–K9 by G9a is associated with the
silencing of euchromatic genes (13).
Mammalian G9a mono- and di-methylates H3–K9 at
euchromatic loci (14,15), and has recently also been found
at heterochromatic loci (16). In g9a/g9a mice H3–K9

methylation is drastically reduced resulting in severe growth
retardation and early lethality (17). The loss of G9a primarily
affects the methylation of H3–K9 in euchromatic regions
(14). G9a is the major euchromatic histone H3–K9 methyl-
transferase in higher eukaryotes but in Drosophila the
euchromatic H3–K9 HKMTase has not been characterized.
Although the H3–K9 methylation is strongly reduced in
Su(var)3–9 null mutants, a small amount of H3 molecules
remain methylated at K9 suggesting the existence of other
K9 specific HKMTases in Drosophila (18).
There are several reports demonstrating the silencing
effects from H3–K9 methylation, including the inactive X
chromosome of female mice and humans (19), and develop-
mentally regulated genes (20).
In a search for SET domain containing genes in Drosophila
that might code a K9 specific HKMTase, we performed
a bioinformatics search of the Drosophila melanogaster
genome and found the gene CG2995 which share significant
homology to mammalian G9a. In this paper we describe the
cloning, and the biochemical and genetical analyses of
CG2995. We show that it encodes a histone methyltransferase
specific for H3–K9, K27 and H4, and that it shares the
structural organization of mammalian G9a. Therefore, we
suggest that CG2995 is renamed dG9a. It adds up to three
methyl groups to unmethylated H3 and H4. Our results
indicate a role for dG9a in germ cell formation. Using
RNAi we show that dG9a is critical for development, very
likely by being involved in the ecdysone regulated gene
expression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fly handling and generation of transgenic flies
All genetic crosses were carried out at 25C. Fly lines were
obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila stock centre.
Generation of double stranded (ds) RNA was performed by
using the pHIBS and pUds-GFP vectors as described in
Ref. (21). A 756 bp fragment of dG9a cDNA was PCR
amplified with the 2995UBamHI (50-CAAGGATCCTGTCG-
CACTTCTCGTTCATC-30) and 2995LKpnI (50-TGCGGTA-
CCTGCTGGATAATGCATTGTGTT-30) primers.
Transgenic flies were generated by P-element mediated
transformation, and nine independent lines on different
chromosomes were established, including the 2995-18 line
used in this study. The GAL4-UAS system (22) was used
to express dG9a.IR construct, and Act5C-GAL4 (BL 4414),
da-GAL4 (BL 5460), P{GawB}c698a (BL 3739), and
ap-GAL4 (BL 3041) were used as drivers. As control the
2995-18 line without driver was used.
The ap-GAL4,UAS-dG9a.IR/EcRM554fs flies were generated
by standard genetic procedures.
Bioinformatics tools
Database searches were performed using BLASTP,
TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST/). Protein domains were identified using the
programs RPS-BLAST (NCBI) and ProfileScan (http://hits.
isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN) searching the Pfam-A, Prosite
profiles and Smart databases (NCBI). Nuclear localization
signal was detected by using PredictNLS (http://cubic.bioc.
columbia.edu/predictNLS/). Amino acid sequence alignments
were created using ClustalX 1.8 (http://www-igbmc.
u-strasbg.fr/BioInfo/ClustalX) with default parameters and
manual adjustments from GeneDoc 2.6.001 (http://www.
psc.edu/biomed/genedoc/).
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analyses
50-RACE and 30-RACE were performed using a Marathon
cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech) with 2 mg of total RNA
isolated from adult female flies as template and Advantage
2 Polymerace Mix in accordance with the manufacturer’s rec-
ommendations. RACE PCR products were sequenced using a
MegaBACE 1000 sequencer.
Sequences of primers used for RACE analyses are
available on request. DNA and amino acid sequences derived
from the cDNAs were compared and analyzed with the
GenBank database.
RT–PCR
Testes and ovaries from adults were dissected in Ringer’s
solution (6.5 g NaCl, 0.14 g KCl, 0.2 g NaHCO3, 0.12 g
CaCl2 and 0.01 g NaH2PO4 per liter). Total RNA was isolated
from indicated tissues or stages by the use of TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen), and 5 mg of total RNA were reverse transcribed
with SuperScript III RNase H-free reverse transcriptase
(RT) (Invitrogen). A random primer pd(N)6 was used for
first-strand synthesis. PCR was performed with 2995left
(50-GATGAACGAGAAGTGCGACA-30, located in exon 5)
and 2995right (50-GATGAACGAGAAGTGCGACA-30,
located in exon 9) primers and with rp49 primers (23)
as loading control for 35 cycles at an annealing temperature
of 56C.
Immunostainings and immunofluorescence
The anti-dG9a polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits
(Eurogentec S.A) against a synthetic peptide containing
dG9a residues 1623–1637. The antiserum was affinity
purified.
Polytene chromosomes from the salivary glands of third
instar larvae were prepared and stained essentially as
described in Ref. (24).
Tissues were stained with anti-dG9a (1:25). As secondary
antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated with AlexaFluor
555 (MedProbe, diluted 1:200) were used. Materials were
co-stained with DAPI for visualization of DNA. Preparations
were analyzed by using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope
equipped with a KAPPA DX20C charge-coupled device
camera. Staining of larval tissues, ovaries and embryos
were performed using standard techniques with anti-dG9a,
as described above. Preparations were analyzed by using a
ZeissAxioplan2 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam
HRc camera, software: AxioVision3.1. Images were assem-
bled, contrasted and merged electronically by using
Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems).
Whole-mount in situ hybridization
RNA in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled anti-
sense RNA probes was performed as described previously
(25,26). A cDNA containing dG9a was linearized with

BamHI and used as template to make a 674 bp dG9a RNA
probe.
Western analysis
Nuclear extract from 0–12 h dechorionated embryos (27) was
separated on a SDS–PAGE (8%). Proteins were transferred
onto PVDF membrane (Amersham) and probed with an
anti-dG9a antibody (1:500) using standard procedures. Sec-
ondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (Amersham) were
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Detection
of antibody signals was performed with chemiluminescence
(Pierce).
Generation of baculovirus, viral transfection and
dG9a purification
Amino acids 789–1637 of dG9a was PCR amplified with the
primers 2995 SpeIFlag (50-GACTACAAGGACGACGATG-
ACAAGATTTGTCTATGTCAGAAGCCTTCC-30, FLAG tag
sequence underlined) and 2995 KpnI (50-TGCGGTACCCTA-
CGCGTGTCCAATTTTCT-30) cloned into pFastBac(tm)1
(Invitrogen) as a SpeI/KpnI fragment. Site-directed mutage-
nesis of flag-dG9a (789–1637 amino acid) was performed
using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) with primers
CG2995H1536KBstNIfwd (50-ATGGAAATGTAACCAGG-
TTTTTTAACAAGTC GTGTGAGCCGAATG-30) and
CG2995H1536KBstNIrew (50-CATTCGG CTCACACGAC-
TTGTTAAAAAACCTGGTTACATTTCCAT-30).
FLAG tagged dG9a in pFastBacTM1 was transformed into
DH10Bac (Invitrogen) and bacemid purified according to
protocol (Invitrogen). A monolayer of SF9 (Spodoptera
frugiperda) (9 · 105) was transfected with 1 mg of bacemid
using Cellfectin Reagent (Invitrogen) and cells were left for
7 days at 26C. The supernatant was amplified 2–3 times
and recombinant viruses were used for test expression. Cell
extracts were checked, 48 h post-transfection, for fusion pro-
tein expression using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody
(Sigma). For routine protein expression 10 · 150 mm Petri
dishes were infected and the cells kept at 26C. The cells
were harvested 48 h post-infection and washed once with
1· phosphate-buffered saline. For purification of FLAG-
dG9A protein, infected cells (1.2 · 108) were resuspended
in 4 ml of BC300 [25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 300 mM
NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10%
(v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors] containing
0.05% (v/v) NP40. The cells were sonicated on ice two times
for 15 s at 50% amplitude using a Branson sonifier and
centrifuged at 15 000 r.p.m. for 30 min and 100 ml 1:1 slurry
of M2 anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma) was added to the
supernatant followed by incubation for 2 h at 4C. After
washing three times with BC300 [containing 0.05% (v/v)
NP40] for 10 min each, and once with BC100 [0.05% (v/v)
NP40] the bound protein was eluted with 0.5 mg/ml FLAG
peptide BC100 [0.05% (v/v) NP40] for 2 h. The purity of
the protein was checked by SDS–PAGE. Eluates were stored
at 80C.
Histone purification and nucleosome assembly
Recombinant Drosophila histones were expressed and puri-
fied from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys, and recons-
tituted into octamers as described previously (28).
Recombinant histone H3 carrying the mutations K9A,
K27A or K9A/K27A were expressed from plasmids kindly
provided by D. Reinberg, and histone H4 carrying a
K20A mutation was expressed from a plasmid given by
T. Jenuwein. Recombinant H4 N-terminal mutant proteins
D5, D10, D15, D19 were expressed and purified as described
previously (29). Native histones were purified from 0–12 h
Drosophila embryos essentially as described in Ref. (30).
Nucleosomes were reconstituted on circular pBS(KS) (Strata-
gene) by salt dialysis over night from 2 to 0.1 M NaCl (31).
Histone methyltransferase assay
Histone methyltransferase assays were performed as
described in Ref. (32). In short, 100 ng of eluted dG9a was
mixed with 1 or 2 mg of histone H3, H4, octamer or nucleo-
somes and S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]-l-methionine (25 mCi/ml)
(Amersham) in a buffer containing 12.5 mM Tris–HCl, pH
8.8, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 50 ng/ml BSA and 2.5 mM
MgCl2. The reaction was incubated at 30
C for 1 h and
stopped by adding SDS–PAGE loading buffer. The histones
were separated by 15% SDS–PAGE, Coomassie stained,
amplified and dried. The autoradiograph was developed
after 1 and 2 weeks. For experiments with mouse G9a, we
used 250 ng of protein and the incubation time was 30 min.
Exposure time for autoradiograph was 1 and 2 days.
MALDI-TOF analysis
Methylation reactions were carried out as described above
with 0.5 mg of histone H3 or H4 and 250 mM of
S-Adenosylmethionine (New England BioLabs). The reaction
was stopped by addition of SDS–PAGE loading buffer and
the histones were separated by 15% SDS–PAGE. The
Coomassie stained bands corresponding to H3 and H4 were
excised and subjected to chemical modification to derive
free amino groups of lysine residues as described previously
(33). H3 and H4 were digested over night with 100 ng of
sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) in a total volume of
40 ml according to manufacturer’s protocol. In order to purify
the methylated peptides from contaminating salts or acry-
lamide the peptide solution was passed over a pipette tip
containing C18 material (ZipTip, Millipore) and eluted as
described previously (32). The MALDI spectra were acquired
and analyzed as described previously (34). Reaction mix
without enzyme was used for calibration. Quantification
was performed as previously described in Ref. (35).
Ecdysone feeding experiments
The feeding experiments were performed essentially as
described in Ref. (36).
RESULTS
CG2995 is the Drosophila homolog of the mouse
G9a HKMTase
We performed a bioinformatics search of the D. melanogaster
genome with the Su(var)3–9, E(Z) and Trithorax SET
domains and found novel genes encoding putative SET pro-
teins. Performing a BLASTP search with the SET domain
of one of these proteins, the annotated CG2995 protein,

against the mouse and human database identified it as the
Drosophila homolog of the G9a protein. This SET domain
alone shares 61% identity (76% similarity) with the corre-
sponding domain of the mouse G9a protein (Figure 1A). In
comparison, the SET domain of CG2995 shares 45% identity
with the SET domain of the Su(var)3–9 protein of
Drosophila, suggesting that CG2995 is the only homolog of
G9a in the Drosophila genome. This is emphasized when
looking at the pre-SET/SET/post-SET regions, where it is
notable that CG2995 is more similar to mouse G9a than to
Su(var)3–9 or dSET2. Thus, dSu(var)3–9 versus G9a shows
37% identity, 55% similarity, dSET2 versus G9a displays
36% identity, 50% similarity, and CG2995 versus G9a has
47% identity, 68% similarity. CG2995 is located as the
third gene in region 1A1 on the X chromosome, and a further
comparative analysis of the CG2995 protein with the mouse
G9a shows that the CG2995 has 33% identity and 49% simi-
larity to the mouse protein (1172–1263 amino acid). The fly
protein is longer at the N-terminus but otherwise shares the
same module organization as its mouse counterpart. The
CG2995 protein contains multiple putative domains in addi-
tion to the SET domain, like the adjacent cysteine-rich
regions [the pre-SET (also called SAC); (37)], and conserved
cysteine residues in the C-terminal region of the SET domain
that corresponds to the post-SET domain (Figure 1A), which
has shown to be required for enzymatic activity (38).
Within the SET domain, a H(R)FFNHSC motif (where F
indicates a hydrophobic residue) has previously been shown
to be an important catalytic site. For SUV39H1 protein, a
histidine-to-arginine mutation of the first histidine (His320)
in the 320HFFNHSC326 motif resulted in a 20-fold higher
catalytic activity (38). This observation suggests that the
H(R)FFNHSC motif is correlated with the HKMTase
activity. The CG2995 protein contains a 1532RFFNHSC1538
motif (Figure 1A, underlined), together with another motif
reported to be needed for HKMTase activity, GE(x)5Y,
located in the C-terminal end of the SET domain (38;
Figure 1A, underlined).
In addition, the CG2995 protein harbors contiguous copies
of a 33-amino acid repeat (Figure 1B). This repeat, originally
identified in the Notch protein of Drosophila and known as
the ankyrin repeat, is also found in G9a and in a number of
other proteins involved in intracellular protein–protein
interactions (39).
An AT-hook also is found in the N-terminus part of the
CG2995 protein. The AT-hook is a small DNA-binding
protein motif that was first described in the high mobility
group non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-I(Y). Since
its discovery, this motif has been observed in other DNA-
binding proteins from a wide range of organisms. Further-
more, AT-hook motifs are frequently associated with
known functional domains seen in chromatin proteins and
in DNA-binding proteins (e.g. histone folds, homeodomains
and zinc fingers). In general, it appears that the AT-hook
motif is an auxiliary protein motif co-operating with other
DNA-binding activities and facilitating changes in the
structure of the DNA either as a polypeptide on its own
[e.g. HMG-I(Y)] (40) or as part of a multidomain protein

[e.g. Swi2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or HRX (ALL-1) in
Homo sapiens] (41). It is most interesting that this motif
seems to be specific to known or predicted chromosomal/
DNA-binding proteins, suggesting that it may act as a
versatile minor groove tether (41). A nuclear localization
signal is found in the N-terminal of the protein. In conclusion,
CG2995 has a high level of similarity to mouse G9a and we
suggest CG2995 is the Drosophila homolog of G9a and will
refer to it as dG9a.
Full-length cDNA was cloned by RACE and RT–PCR.
This cDNA revealed that the dG9a gene consists of
10 exons with a 4911 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding
a protein of 1637 amino acid. The coding region ends by an
in-frame stop codon that is followed by a poly(A) signal 1173
downstream, suggesting that it is full-length and consistent
with the annotated sequence in FlyBase (http://flybase.bio.
indiana.edu/; Figure 1B). Northern analysis also showed
that there is only one transcript of expected size (data not
shown).
The dG9a protein localizes to euchromatin
Antibodies specific to dG9a were generated by immunization
of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino
acids (1623 through 1637 amino acid). This antibody
recognized a band of the predicted size of 180 kDa
(Figure 2A). The localization of dG9a protein was investi-
gated by analysis of polytene chromosomes from salivary
glands (Figure 2B). The immunostaining showed discrete
banding pattern in euchromatic regions with no staining
observed in the chromocenter.
Spatiotemporal expression of dG9a
To investigate the spatiotemporal expression of dG9a we first
used semi-quantitative RT–PCR. As shown in Figure 3A, a
low but measurable amount of dG9a transcript is present in
0–3-h-old embryos. In 3–6-h-old embryos the expression of
dG9a is barely detectable, indicating that the dG9a transcripts
seen in 0–3-h-old embryos are of maternal origin. Between 6
and 21 h of embryogenesis the expression of dG9a is low but
clearly discernible, and about the same level of expression
is observed throughout larval development, with a slightly
elevated expression during the third larval instar. Then, in
12–46-h-old pupae there is no or very little expression of
dG9a. In adult flies the expression of dG9a is restricted
to the gonads in both sexes (Figure 3A, last four lanes).
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that dG9a is
expressed in one or more tissues of the gonadectomized
flies, but at a level too low to be detected by the RT–PCR
settings used here.
Next, in order to study the spatiotemporal expression of
dG9a in more detail, we stained ovaries and embryos with
the dG9a antibody. The immunostainings revealed that
dG9a is expressed in all cells of the ovary, including the
germarium (Figure 3C) where especially the nurse cells,

stage 10B egg chambers it appears that dG9a is markedly
upregulated in what appears to be the centripetal follicle
cells (Figure 3E, arrowheads). At this stage, a moderate
upregulation is also discernible in the posterior follicle cells
(arrow). During stage 11 nurse start dumping their content
into the oocyte, which is revealed by an accumulation of
dG9a at the border between the growing oocyte and the
degenerating nurse cells (Figure 3G). At this stage an
increased expression of dG9a is also found in the posterior
follicle cells (Figure 3G, arrow head). In stage 12 the amount
of dG9a has increased considerably and has started to move
into the oocyte. An accumulation in the posterior follicle
cells is now prominent (Figure 3I, arrow). At stage 14,
dG9a appears to be evenly distributed in the mature oocyte
(Figure 3K).
In blastoderm embryos (stage 4, 1.5–2.5 h) dG9a
transcript as well as protein are present in the syncytial
nuclei (Figure 3L and M). During stages 9 and 12, dG9a
expression appears to be more abundant in the central nerv-
ous system (CNS) and the neuroectoderm (Figure 3N, O
and Q). Figure 3S shows a surface view of embryo at the
completion of germband shortening, with all cells evenly
stained.
Expression and purification of recombinant histone
methyltransferase dG9a
In order to investigate the enzymatic properties of dG9a we
expressed a FLAG tagged N-terminal fragment (789–1637
amino acid) using a baculovirus expression system. The
purified dG9a was soluble and had the expected molecular
size of 95 kDa (Figure 4A). To confirm that dG9a has HKM-
Tase activity we incubated it in presence of H3-S-adenosyl-
methionine (SAM) and different substrates (Figure 4B).
dG9a methylates H3 and H4 present as free histones
but had no detectable activity on nucleosomal arrays.
In contrast to the recombinant dG9a, mouse G9a only methy-
lates H3 even when other histones are present (Figure 4C).
In order to exclude the possibility that the unexpected H4
HMT activity is due to a contaminating activity co-purifying
with the recombinant dG9a we expressed the enzyme carry-
ing a point mutation within the SET domain (H1536K) that
dramatically impairs its catalytic activity. The mutated
enzyme was not able to methylate either H3 or H4 indicating
that both methylations are a result of dG9a activity
(Figure 4D). In order to determine the substrate specificity
we performed a quantitative MALDI-TOF analysis of H3
molecules methylated by dG9a. Similarly to the activity of
the mouse ortholog (42), dG9a methylates exclusively K9
and K27 with K9 being the preferred substrate in wild-type
(wt) H3. As shown for mG9a (43) dG9a is able to add up
to three methyl groups to H3 (Figure 4H). This finding is
confirmed by using H3 molecules carrying a lysine to alanine
replacement at position 9 and 27 or both (Figure 4E).
We observe decreased methylation efficiency on H3 K9A
and H3 K27A compared to wt H3. In a filter binding assay
we observed a 70% reduction when K9 was mutated and
a 50% reduction when K27 was mutated. When both H3
lysine residues were mutated (K9A and K27A) we
observe a lower activity (efficiency of 27%) indicating
that in absence of K9 and K27 dG9a is also able to methylate
other lysines. Mouse G9a also showed a decreased activity
(27%) towards the double mutant (K9A/K27A) (Figure 4F).
When we use highly active mG9a (43), it methylates wt
H3 and the H3 molecules carrying a single mutation on
K9 or K27 with a similar efficiency. However, as we
use relatively long reaction times we can not exclude the
possibility that K9 is methylated faster than K27, which
explains the larger differences observed in previous
publications (16,44).
Interestingly dG9a was also able to methylate histone H4
(Figure 4B). This is in marked contrast to the mouse G9a
where we do not observe such an activity (Figure 4C) (42).
The only lysine residue of H4 shown to be methylated
in vivo is K20 and the first HKMTase identified with this
activity was hPR-Set7/dSET8 (45,46). Other HKMTases in
Drosophila shown to methylate H4 lysine 20 are Ash1 and
Suv4–20 (47,48). Ash1 is in addition able to methylate lysine
4 and 9 in histone H3 (47). From these experiments we
concluded that dG9a also is a multi-catalytic histone methyl-
transferase with specificity for lysine 9 and 27 on H3 and
possibly lysine 20 on histone H4. However, when we
incubated dG9a with H4 carrying a mutation of lysine 20 to
alanine we observed no reduction of activity (Figure 4G). To
further investigate the specificity, we tested whether dG9a
was able to methylate H4 molecules carrying different
N-terminal deletions (29). We observed that dG9a could
methylate the H4 N-terminus when the first five amino
acids were deleted, excluding K5 as a possible substrate.
However, the activity was lost when we used the H4 D10
mutant (Figure 4G). This suggests that the substrate is K8,
but considering that the minimal substrate specificity for
mG9a surrounding K9 contains seven amino acids (TARK-
STG) (49) we cannot exclude that another downstream lysine
can serve as a substrate. MALDI-TOF analysis of H4 methy-
lated by dG9a, showed that only the peptide containing amino
acids 4–17 was methylated in vitro (Figure 4H). We conclude
from these experiments that dG9a can methylate lysine 8, 12
or 16 of H4 in vitro. It remains to be seen to what level these
lysines are methylated in vivo and what the function of this
methylation is.
dG9a is required for normal development
To investigate the in vivo function of dG9a, transgenic flies
with an inverted-repeat UAS-dG9a.IR construct were crossed
to different GAL4-driver lines (22). The vector used for mak-
ing the inverted repeats has an independent UAS-GFP marker
so that a tissue exposed to RNAi will simultaneously show
GFP expression [pUds-GFP; (21)] as an internal control to
RNAi expression. In addition, down regulation of dG9a
was confirmed by RT–PCR (Figure 5A).
Using the ubiquitously expressed da-GAL4 driver with the
UAS-dG9a.IR flies, the progeny developed normally until
the end of the third larval instar. However, these RNAi larvae
did not form their puparium and crawling larvae were found
after 7–8 days (Figure 5B). The majority of these larvae
developed melanotic tumors, either one or two larger ones
or several smaller. The larvae finally stopped moving, and
in the few cases where ‘pseudo-prepupae’ were formed,

these maintained the elongated larval form and failed to evert
the anterior spiracles; there was only slight melanization of
these ‘pseudo-prepupae’ (Figure 5C).
The defects in puparium formation seen in dG9a RNAi
animals could result from either a decrease in the ecdysone
titer or a decrease in the ability of the ecdysone signal to
be transduced. To distinguish between these possibilities we
examined the effects of feeding ecdysone to dG9a RNAi
larvae. This method has been shown to effectively rescue
phenotypes associated with ecdysone-deficient mutations
(36). Mid- and late-third instar larvae were transferred to
food either with or without 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) for
6–8 h and scored on a 12-h basis. Feeding 20E to dG9a
RNAi larvae did not rescue them to puparium formation.
Therefore, we conclude that ecdysone is not limiting in the
da-GAL4/UAS-dG9a.IR animals and that dG9a functions
downstream of ecdysone biosynthesis and release.
When the ubiquitously expressed, but weaker, Act5C-
GAL4 driver was used, development of progeny of genotype
Act5C-GAL4/UAS-dG9a.IR proceeded up to and through
puparium formation (data not shown). However, most of
the pupal cases were only lightly tanned and no flies eclosed
from these cases. Upon dissection, dead and partially
differentiated pharates with no eye pigmentation or legs
were found (data not shown). Development appeared to
have proceeded further in the posterior part of fly. Of all
pupae formed (N ¼ 133), 17% developed normally, and
the eclosed flies were without exception females.
As immunostaining indicated a role for dG9a in neuro-
ectoderm and CNS, a driver which expresses GAL4 in
brain and throughout CNS, but not in discs, of third instar
larvae, P{GawB}c698a, was used. The phenotypes observed
were similar to those observed with the Act5C-GAL4 driver.
Here, however, most of the pupae were partly more mela-
nized (Figure 5D), without differentiation proceeding any
further than that described for the Act5C-GAL4 driver
(Figure 5E). A small portion (5%) of the pupae actually
developed normally but of these almost all failed to escape
from the pupal case. The very few that succeeded were all
normal females and lived for at least 2 weeks.
The results described above strongly suggest a defect in
ecdysone responses at puparium formation, similar to those
reported earlier for mutants in the ecdysone pathway (50).
Also, using RNAi very similar results were obtained with
the H3–K36 HKMTase dSet2 gene (M. Stabell, unpublished
data).
Ecdysone controls wing morphogenesis and cell adhesion
by regulating integrin expression during metamorphosis
(51). Therefore, to test further the possible involvement of
dG9a in the ecdysone regulation hierarchy, we triggered
dG9a RNAi in the wing disc by the ap-GAL4 driver. This
resulted in slightly held-out/up wings with an anterior–
posterior compression (Figure 5F), and occasionally in blister
formation (Figure 5G). We next generated flies of genotype
ap-GAL4,UAS-dG9a.IR/EcRM554fs. EcRM554fs is a loss of
function mutation where only half the amount of the ecdy-
sone receptor is present in mutant flies. As shown in
Figure 5I, these animals show a wing phenotype of a more
extreme character, with both wings having a blister and
being clearly smaller than normal, most likely because the
wings never completely unfold. This phenotype has 100%
penetrance. Taken together, these results support the notion
that dG9a functions in ecdysone signaling pathways during
development.
DISCUSSION
dG9a is a euchromatic histone methyltransferase
In this study we show that CG2995 is the Drosophila
homolog of the HKMTase G9a, and that it specifically
mono-, di- and trimethylates H3–K9, H3–K27 and K8, 12
or 16 in H4. This methylation pattern is mainly correlated
with silencing (11) suggesting that dG9a is involved in
transcriptional repression. Further, we showed that dG9a
methylates free histones but has no detectable activity on
nucleosomal arrays. As revealed by the staining of polytene
chromosomes, the centromeric region, where Su(var)3–9 pre-
dominantly stains (52), is devoid of dG9a. We therefore con-
clude that dG9a is a euchromatic histone methyltransferase
that acts on loosely packed DNA and that methylation by
dG9a may occur on pre-assembled histones.

dG9a is expressed throughout development
Immunostaining revealed that the dG9a protein is found
throughout oogenesis, embryogenesis, and larval develop-
ment. During these stages, large cells (like nurse cells and
salivary gland cells) are metabolically very active, and having
multiple copies of genes (polyteny) permits a high level of
gene expression; that is, abundant transcription and transla-
tion to produce the gene products. (53). In adult flies the
dG9a transcript and protein are solely found in the gonads,
where cells are undergoing extensive endo- and mitotic rep-
lication. One can assume that is important that certain
genes are kept silent in these cells, and one possible function
of dG9a could be to maintain repression of a subset of genes
in cells that otherwise have a high gene expression level.
In the RNAi knock down studies, no lethality was observed
during embryogenesis, but this can be ascribed to the fact that
the RNAi construct was made using a pUAST based vector
that is defect in the germline during oogenesis (22). Condi-
tional knock down of dG9a in the female germline was there-
fore not possible in this study, but should be subject for future
investigation. An interesting observation is that the escapers
from the RNAi studies are exclusively females. This result
suggests that dG9a may have different roles in males versus
females. It is possible that conditional depletion of dG9a in
transgenic flies may affect the expression of genes that are
required for chromatin stability, chromosome segregation
and proper histone modifications resulting in a preferential
lethality in male flies. This has recently been reported for
Su(var)205 (also called HP1) (54), and bonus (bon), encoding
a homolog of the vertebrate TIF1 transcriptional cofactors
and required for male viability (55). Interestingly, bon is
associated with genes that are implicated in the ecdysone
pathway.
dG9a is involved in ecdysone mediated signaling
Next, we provide evidence that dG9a is required for impor-
tant transitions during Drosophila development. Our results
suggest a role for dG9a in regulation of genes, especially dur-
ing the onset of metamorphosis, and wing development, pro-
cesses tightly correlated to ecdysone responsive signaling
(56). Additional evidence for dG9a being involved in the
ecdysone hierarchy is the formation of melanotic tumors in
the larvae that do not form their puparium. Several
chromatin-modifying or chromatin-associated complexes
(57) as well as ecdysone have been implicated in hemocyte
development and melanotic tumor formation (58,59). Further-
more, our genetic studies revealed that the EcRM544fs is able
to dominantly affect the wing phenotype in ap-GAL4,UAS-
dG9a.IR/EcRM554fs flies. Genetic interactions between mutant
alleles of different genes are indicative of these genes belong-
ing to the same functional pathway. Thus, the genetic studies
support the results from the RNAi experiments, and together
provide strong evidence of dG9a being involved in the ecdy-
sone signaling hierarchy. As the RNAi mutants are not res-
cued by hormone feeding, dG9a must exert its effect
downstream of ecdysone biosynthesis and metabolism. One
possible scenario is that dG9a acts as a co-regulator for the
ecdysone receptor mediating downstream gene regulation as
a response to ecdysone pulses. A similar scenario has been
reported for mammalian G9a, where a reduction of endoge-
nous G9a reduced hormonal activation of an endogenous
target gene by the androgen receptor (60).
Figure 5. Knock down of dG9a give phenotypic effects. RNAi experiments show that dG9a is important for development. (A) RT–PCR shows that dG9a is down
regulated by RNAi; rp49 is used as loading control. (B and C) Using a ubiquitously expressed driver, da-GAL4, to induce the IR construct shows that dG9a is
required for proper transition from larva to pupa. Penetrance is 100%. In (B) the larva is 6 days, in (C) 8 days. The IR construct is tagged with an independent
UAS-GFP, which can be used as control (insert). Melanotic tumors are frequently observed in these larvae. (D and E) Using a larval CNS-GAL4 (BL 3739) driver
the progeny makes it up to and through pupariation (F), but fails to hatch. Differentiation seems more complete in posterior part of the animal (G). A similar
phenotype is observed when using Act5C-GAL4 as driver. Remarkably, in both cases, the escapers observed to hatch (10%) are females. (H and I) When using
the ap-GAL4 driver defects in the wings are observed. This phenotype is highly pleiotropic, with one or both wings affected. Among the phenotypes are narrow
wings held in a Dichaeate-like fashion, wings standing straight up and blistered wings. Progeny with no apparent defects are also observed. (J) Progeny of
genotype ap-GAL4,UAS-dG9a.IR/EcRM544fs show a wing phenotype of severe character and 100% penetrance.

The genetic interaction between EcRM554fs and ap-
GAL4,UAS-dG9a.IR on wing development may suggest a
molecular interaction between the EcR receptor and dG9a.
Activation and repression of transcription involve
the recruitment of many co-regulator (co-repressor or
co-activator) proteins to the regulated gene promoter
by sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors. As
dG9a contains an AT-hook, it could tether the ecdysone
receptor to the DNA, or, more plausible, the DNA binding
activity of EcR by could bring dG9a to the promoter. Two
models could explain the EcR-dG9a relationship observed:
(i) dG9a act as a co-repressor of the early puffs according to
the Ashburner model for the hormonal control of
polytene chromosome puffing (61). Briefly, this model
proposed that ecdysone, bound to its specific receptor,
directly induces the expression of a small set of early
regulatory genes. The protein products of these genes, in
turn, repress their own expression and induce a much
larger set of late target genes. dG9a could be involved in
this repression.
(ii) dG9a act as a co-activator coupled to the transcription
apparatus during activation of ecdysone regulated genes.
Vakoc and co-workers (62) reported recently that H3–K9
methylation was found at high levels in the transcribed region
of four genes while they were transcribed. This observation is
rather remarkable in that it implies a coupling of the tradition-
ally accounted H3–K9 silencing mark to active transcription.
Therefore, the possibility that dG9a plays a role in maintain-
ing transcription should be further investigated. In addition,
there are observations that murine G9a acts both as a
co-repressor (63–65), and a co-activator (60), depending on
promoter context and/or regulatory environment, along with
the observation that the zinc finger protein wiz links G9a/
GLP histone methyltransferases to the co-repressor molecule
CtBP (66). Furthermore, NSD1, which methylates both
H3–K36 and H4–K20 in vitro (67), acts as a co-activator
and a co-repressor for NRs (37).
As a complement to the RNAi approach, we have tried to
generate null mutants (deletions) by re-mobilization of the P-
element inserted in the 50-untranslated region (50-UTR) of
dG9a in the dG9a13414 stock. Whereas several independent
lines with precise excision of the P-element were obtained
we failed to find any imprecise excision (deletion) events
(M. Stabell, unpublished data). During the course of the pre-
paration of this manuscript, Mis et al. (68) also identified
CG2995 as being the Drosophila homolog of mammalian
G9a. This group also reported unsuccessful mobilization of
the P-element, and suggested that this may be due to a defec-
tive P-element. Instead, they investigated the dG9a13414/
dG9a13414 mutant and report only a minor phenotype without
characterizing the nature of the mutant. On the other hand,
they showed that this dG9a13414 mutant suppresses position
effect variegation (PEV) and that it interacts genetically
with Su(var)3–9, suggesting that the two proteins have an
overlapping role in heterochromatic gene silencing and may
be members of protein complexes involved gene silencing.
In contrast to Mis et al. (68) who concluded that dG9a is a
H3–K9 HKMTase, we provide evidence that dG9a (i) methy-
lates H4 as well as H3, (ii) is able to add three methyl groups,
(iii) methylates K9 and K27 on histone H3 with a preference
for K9 and (iv) has a specificity towards K8, K12 or K16 on
the H4 N-terminus. In polytene chromosomes dG9a is
excluded from the chromocenter (Figure 3), indicating a
euchromatic role for dG9a. But as the majority of full-length
GFP-mG9a fusion proteins has been found in pericentric
heterochromatin (16), we cannot rule out a conceivable func-
tion for dG9a during facultative heterochromatinization in
other tissues and/or stages of development.
