ABSTRACT
Analysis of functional genomics (transcriptomics
and proteomics) datasets is hindered in agricultural
species because agricultural genome sequences
have relatively poor structural and functional
annotation. To facilitate systems biology in these
species we have established the curated, web-
accessible, public resource ‘AgBase’ (www.agbase.
msstate.edu). We have improved the structural
annotation of agriculturally important genomes by
experimentally confirming the in vivo expression
of electronically predicted proteins and by proteo-
genomic mapping. Proteogenomic data are avail-
able from the AgBase proteogenomics link. We
contribute Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and
we provide a two tier system of GO annotations for
users. The ‘GO Consortium’ gene association file
contains the most rigorous GO annotations based
solely on experimental data. The ‘Community’ gene
association file contains GO annotations based on
expert community knowledge (annotations based
directly from author statements and submitted anno-
tations from the community) and annotations for
predicted proteins. We have developed two tools
for proteomics analysis and these are freely avail-
able on request. A suite of tools for analyzing
functional genomics datasets using the GO is avail-
able online at the AgBase site. We encourage
and publicly acknowledge GO annotations from
researchers and provide an online mechanism for
agricultural researchers to submit requests for GO
annotations.
INTRODUCTION
Annotation of agricultural genomes
The complete sequencing of the human genome resulted in
improved sequencing technologies and reduced expenses
for whole genome sequencing. Consequently many genome
sequencing projects are now underway. Among the agricul-
turally important species the chicken and rice genomes are
completed (1–3), the bovine genome has a draft assembly
available (4) and other agricultural genome sequencing pro-
jects (including pig, maize, wheat, soybean and grape) are
in progress (5–8). Effective use of these genome sequences
to model biological systems requires both structural annota-
tion (denoting and demarcating genes and other functional
elements) and functional annotation (assigning functions to
each genomic element) (9,10).
Initial genome structural annotation is done computation-
ally either by homology prediction to known genes in other
species (‘predicted’ genes) or by using ab initio prediction
algorithms that search for specific patterns indicative of
open reading frames (ORFs) (11,12). However, these electro-
nic genome structural-annotation methods produce false
positive and false negative predictions as high as 70% (13)
and commonly misclassify pseudogenes as functional (14).
The use of experimental data for genome annotation is criti-
cal for conclusive identification of the functional sequences
within genomes, accurate description of intron/exon struc-
tures and determination of the potential protein products
from each gene in different tissues and cellular states (15).

Transcriptome data allow annotation of RNA termini, splice
junctions and untranslated RNAs. In addition, quantitative
processes at the RNA level are independent of the protein
level. However, detection of an mRNA is not conclusive evi-
dence that the gene has a protein product (16). Proteogenomic
mapping uses high-throughput mass spectrometry-based
methods to provide direct evidence for the existence of
proteins in vivo (15,17–19) and their locations in cells (20).
Proteomics also more accurately determines the boundaries
of functional ORFs and identifies unknown ORFs that cannot
be well established on the basis of homology.
In contrast to the structural genome, which is considered
to be fixed (at least in the short term), the functional genome
rapidly changes both quantitatively and qualitatively in
response to the environment. Understanding the functional
genome informs us how genes function together. Genome
functional annotation describes, interprets and explains the
functions of the gene products themselves. The Gene Onto-
logy (GO) project (21) provides the basis for the design,
development and implementation of publicly available,
expertly curated databases containing comprehensive genome
functional annotations using controlled structured vocabu-
laries (ontologies). First-pass electronic GO annotation
(‘inferred by electronic annotation’ or IEA) is performed by
data mining external sources of gene product information
such as InterPro domains and SwissProt keywords. Anno-
tations ‘inferred from sequence or structural similarities’
(ISS; e.g. by BLAST searches) and IEA rapidly provide
‘breadth’ and are especially valuable for organisms with
little intensive manual GO curation. All other annotations
are performed by expert curators using species-specific litera-
ture or (rarely) expert knowledge and these GO annotations
are considered to be the ‘gold standard’ (22–24).
To facilitate functional analysis in agriculturally important
genomes we launched the AgBase database. The AgBase
database is a curated, open-source, web-accessible resource
for functional analysis of agricultural plant and animal gene
products. Our long-term goal is to serve the needs of the agri-
cultural research communities by facilitating post-genome
biology for agriculture researchers and for those researchers
primarily using agricultural species as biomedical models.
ACCESSING INFORMATION FROM AgBase
The AgBase database provides experimentally derived
structural annotations, GO annotations and tools for analy-
zing functional genomics data. Structural annotations based
on proteogenomic mapping are provided as expressed pep-
tide sequence tags or ‘ePSTs’ (20) and the proteogenomic
pipeline used to generate these ePSTs from proteomic data
is freely available upon request. AgBase curators provide
manually curated GO annotations. We work in collaboration
with the European Bioinformatics Institute GOA project
[EBI-GOA (25)] and specifically focus our efforts on
providing GO annotations for gene products EBI-GOA has
not automatically annotated using IEA. The AgBase gene
detail page displays GO annotations from both AgBase
and EBI-GOA and the group responsible for each GO anno-
tation is attributed. Gene association files of gene products
annotated by AgBase are available for download in a
tab-delimited format. Through EBI-GOA our GO anno-
tations are added to the GO and UniProtKB databases
(21,26). Tools developed by the AgBase consortium are
made freely available upon request and where possible are
web-based. Tools are designed to analyze large datasets
generated by functional genomics based approaches. The
AgBase database can be accessed directly via http://www.
agbase.msstate.edu, or where appropriate the NCBI
Genome Resources pages provide links to GO databases at
AgBase.
Users can access information by text searches of protein
or gene names, text searches of GO terms, searching via a
variety of accession numbers or via BLAST searches. The
AgBase tools also access the AgBase database. Users can
choose to search the entire AgBase database or narrow their
search by choosing an organism-specific database. The text
search performs an exact substring search and multiple
queries are also supported. Searches based on UniProtKB
accessions and identifiers, UniParc identifiers, EMBL acces-
sions, InterPro identifiers and NCBI non-redundant protein
database GenBank gi numbers are supported. A BLAST
based search is also available in instances where the user
has sequences not represented in these databases or for which
there is no database accession. To facilitate data mining the
user has the option of searching the AgBase database by
taxon ID or using either GO term names or identifiers. The
proteogenomic database may also be searched using either
text or BLAST based searches.
A TWO TIER SYSTEM OF GO ANNOTATIONS
Our AgBase download page provides a ‘GO Consortium’
gene association file containing fully quality checked annota-
tions supported by the GO Consortium and a ‘Community’
gene association file containing annotations checked only
for formatting errors by the AgBase biocurators following
GO Consortium guidelines (http://www.geneontology.org/
GO.annotation.shtml#script). This two-tiered system allows
users to choose the breadth of GO coverage most appropriate
for their experimental needs.
The community gene association file contains three kinds
of annotations:
(i) GO annotations for ‘predicted proteins’ without Uni-
ProtKB identifiers that until 10 July 2006, were not
supported by EBI-GOA.
(ii) ISS annotations to evidence codes that stopped being
accepted as of April 2006. For example, we recently
completed ISS annotation of 1609 sheep proteins in
UniProtKB that had no GO annotation but fewer than
half will be released into the UniProtKB database
following the newest GO Consortium guidelines.
(iii) GO annotations from community researchers that have
not yet been quality checked by a trained GO curator.
This type of annotation will be transferred to the GO
Consortium gene association file after quality checks by
AgBase biocurators and the original submitter be
acknowledged in this gene association file.
Documentation is provided at the AgBase download site and
via a link from the AgBase gene detail page informing users
D600 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue
about these different gene association files and the checks that
have been employed for each file. We envision that, just as
for the species with much more advanced GO annotation,
the GO annotations in the community gene association file
will be superseded as more manually curated GO annotations
become available for agricultural species.
ANALYZING FUNCTIONAL DATASETS
The tools currently available at the AgBase database can be
divided into two categories: tools designed to assist with ana-
lysis of proteomics data and tools to evaluate experimental
datasets using the GO. Two tools are available at AgBase
to assist with analyzing proteomics data: the proteogenomic
pipeline and the ProtIDer tool. The GOProfiler tool is
designed to give a statistical summary of existing GO annota-
tions. The GO suite of tools developed for functional analysis
of large datasets includes GOProfiler, GORetriever, GOanna
and GOSlimViewer. This suite of tools is designed so that
users can work online to analyze their large-scale datasets
using GO.
The proteogenomic pipeline is used to provide experimen-
tally based structural annotations at a complete genome level,
and the data we have obtained from proteogenomic mapping
are available from the proteogenomics link at AgBase. The
ProtIDer tool can be used to create a database of highly
homologous proteins from ESTs and EST assemblies and is
designed to assist with proteomic analysis in species which
do not have genomic sequence available. In addition to
providing the ProtIDer tool upon request, we will also
provide organism-specific databases for proteomic analysis
upon request.
GOProfiler provides an overview of current GO anno-
tations available for particular species. The user provides a
species taxonomy ID number (a link to a taxonomy browser
is provided to assist users) and GOProfiler returns the number
of GO associations and the number of annotated proteins for
that species. A separate list of unannotated proteins is also
provided.
GORetriever, GOanna and GOSlimViewer are designed
to be used as a pipeline for analyzing functional datasets
using the GO (Figure 1). GORetriever inputs a list of data-
base identifiers and searches a set of annotated databases
for existing GO annotations of protein sequences. Annotation
information from designated remote databases is stored in a
local database to allow fast processing of large protein
datasets. GORetriever returns the data online, as a down-
loadable Excel file and as a simplified text file (the GO
Summary file) which can subsequently be used in GOSlim-
Viewer. A list of queries without GO annotations is also
provided and the user can add annotation to this list using
GOanna. The GOanna tool differs from the GORetriever
tool in that it does BLAST searches against a user-defined
local database. The GOanna tool accepts a range of inputs,
including fasta files. GOanna returns up to six proteins that
exceed an operator-defined E-value threshold in an Excel
format containing HTML links to each BLAST alignment.
Users manually inspect the output and, in cases where they
are satisfied that the query is orthologous to an annotated
protein, transfer the GO annotation from the annotated
protein to their query. These data can be added to their GO
Summary file. If there are no orthologous proteins with
GO annotation available the user may add GO annotation
by curating published literature or from expert knowledge.
The final GO Summary file is used as an input file for the
GOSlimViewer tool. This tool is used to provide a high-
level summary of the GO terms for a dataset and the output
is a simple text file which can be charted in Excel to obtain
publication quality figures.
Where these tools have modest computational require-
ments they are designed for online use, but all tools are
freely available upon request. Each tool has comprehensive
online help, including worked examples, and users are
encouraged to contact us directly should they require
additional information.
Figure 1. Analysis of functional datasets using the AgBase GO tools.
Together the AgBase GO suite of tools form a pipeline for using GO to
analyze microarray and other functional genomics datasets. Square boxes
represent the tools, octagonal boxes are points in the pipeline that require
human interpretation and ovals represent data files. GORetriever searches a
set of annotated databases for existing GO annotations; sequences without
annotations from GORetriever are entered into GOanna which BLAST
searches a local GO database. GOanna returns up to six proteins that
exceed an operator-defined E-value threshold. The user determines if the
GO annotations from any of these matches can be used. Users may then
choose to add literature-based or expert knowledge GO annotations to
produce the final GO Summary file. GOSlimViewer can then be used to
generate a high level view of the GO annotation for the proteins in a dataset
using GO Slim sets.

COMMUNITY REQUESTS FOR GO
ANNOTATIONS
There are numerous tools available for functional analysis of
datasets (27–32) but these tools assume that a significant
number of the gene products of interest have GO annotation
available. Since this is not the case for agriculturally impor-
tant organisms we designed the GOanna tool so that a user
can leverage data from closely related organisms to add GO
annotations to their experimental dataset. However, even
highly homologous genes may have different functions in
different organisms and direct experimental evidence is the
best data for assigning function to a particular gene product.
Typically (but not always) individual groups within the GO
Consortium are responsible for annotating particular species.
In species where there is a dedicated GO annotation effort,
researchers can contact the responsible database directly to
request further annotations but there is currently no mechani-
sm for requesting annotations in the many other species that
researchers may be studying.
At AgBase we have developed a Community Requests and
Submission form to meet the GO annotation needs of
researchers interested in agriculturally important species.
The type of data that a user must complete to make a request
is scalable, allowing both users new to GO and users who
have had GO biocuration training to enter requests. The
basic request for GO annotations requires that the researcher
identify the gene product of interest using a unique database
accession identifier, the species the gene product comes from
and nominate functional literature about the gene product
(using PubMed ID). Researchers with expert knowledge
about particular gene products have the option of supplying
additional information about the types of experimental data
available and the GO terms associated with the gene product.
Users with biocuration training can upload their data as a
gene association directly to be sanity checked and assimilated
into GO databases. Researchers who submit their own gene
association files will be provided with a unique AgBase anno-
tator ID so that their annotations can be acknowledged. All
users are asked to register and provide a valid email address
so that they may be notified about the progress of their
requests and submissions.
Requests are prioritized based on the number of commu-
nity requests for each gene product and when the request
was received. Gene product priority lists are species specific
(i.e. chicken and cow gene products will not compete) and
time spent on annotating each species is split proportionally
based on the number of requests for each species. Annota-
tions that have been submitted as a gene association file
receive the highest priority as they are quality checked and
submitted to the GO Consortium. Requests are acknowledged
with a return email stating their rank in the request queue and
researchers are notified by email when their request has been
processed and the GO annotation added to the AgBase
database; they are also notified if there is no functional data
available for GO annotation.
AVAILABILITY OF AGBASE DATA AND TOOLS
Access to the AgBase databases is via http://www.agbase.
msstate.edu and access to data is unrestricted. The tools we
have developed are either freely available online at AgBase
or by contacting us at agbase@cse.msstate.edu.
OBTAINING HELP FROM AgBase
Extensive online help, including worked examples, is avail-
able at AgBase by clicking on the help link in the top right
corner of the site. All of our computational tools are freely
available via AgBase, and technical support can be obtained
by contacting us. Our biocurators make every effort to main-
tain data integrity by linking data with researchers, references
and methods. However, similar to all databases, AgBase is an
on-going project and interaction with the user community is
vital for its success. We encourage the submission of data,
correction of errors and suggestions for making AgBase of
greater use including ideas for new computational tools
(email: agbase@cse.msstate.edu).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The primary focus of the AgBase databases is to provide a
resource that facilitates functional analysis in agriculturally
important species. We will continue to work with GO Con-
sortium members (particularly EBI-GOA), other agricultural
based groups [including the Roslin Institute and Gramene
(33)] and community groups to provide improved functional
annotations for agricultural organisms. We are also using
experimental-based approaches for improving genomic struc-
tural annotation and future work will focus on improving the
proteogenomic pipeline, visualizing ePST data and integra-
ting this structural annotation data with functional data.
