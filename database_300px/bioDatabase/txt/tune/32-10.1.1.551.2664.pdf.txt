ABSTRACT
WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org) is a central
data repository for nematode biology. Initially
created as a service to the Caenorhabditis elegans
research field, WormBase has evolved into a
powerful research tool in its own right. In the past
2 years, we expanded WormBase to include the
complete genomic sequence, gene predictions and
orthology assignments from a range of related
nematodes. This comparative data enrich the
C. elegans data with improved gene predictions
and a better understanding of gene function.
In turn, they bring the wealth of experimental
knowledge of C. elegans to other systems of
medical and agricultural importance. Here, we
describe new species and data types now available
at WormBase. In addition, we detail enhancements
to our curatorial pipeline and website infrastructure
to accommodate new genomes and an extensive
user base.
DESCRIPTION
Caenorhabditis elegans is a free-living soil nematode,
well-established as a genetic model system due to its
small size (1mm in length), rapid generation time (3.5
days), compact genome (100MB, 20 000 protein-coding
genes), invariant cell lineage and described neural
connectivity (1; WormBook: http://www.wormbook.
org/). Initially used for studies of development and
neurobiology, C. elegans is now widely used to address a
broad range of biological questions from perspectives
ranging from subcellular to systems and single gene to
whole genome. WormBase aims to capture the full
spectrum of this information, placing it in an intellectually
rich and interactive context to facilitate new insights and
hypotheses.
AVAILABLE SPECIES
WormBase now includes information from a total of
nine species: ﬁve from the Caenorhabditis genus
[C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. remanei, C. brenneri and
C. japonica; (2,3)]; the ﬁlarial agent Brugia malayi (4);
the plant parasites Meloidogyne incognita (5) and
Meloidogyne hapla (6); and the diplogastrid Pristionchus
paciﬁcus (7).
We provide a consistent and familiar user interface for
each species at WormBase. First, we provide a Genome
Browser (e.g. http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse/
c_elegans) using the open source GBrowse software (8).
Second, genome, gene and protein sets (when available)
are accessible for sequence similarity searches using
BLAST and BLAT (http://www.wormbase.org/db/
searches/blast_blat). Finally, Gene and Protein
Summaries give additional details for all known genes.
When available, additional annotations—such as
ortholog and paralog assignments, phenotypic

descriptions and controlled ontology terms—are pre-
sented on these pages.
Comparative studies are facilitated by a wide range of
precalculated data. We provide users with ortholog
assignments derived from the Ensembl Compara pipeline
(9), homology groups from InParanoid (10) and inline tree
displays from TreeFam (11). With these data, users can
eﬀectively step from one species to another, and quickly
compare gene model structures and protein primary
sequences and tertiary structures when known. Further,
multispecies alignments are shown on a separate Synteny
Browser (http://www.wormbase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse_syn;
for details see http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_syn).
ENHANCEMENTS TO THE CURATION PROCESS
WormBase relies on a thorough manual curation pipeline
to extract data from the corpus of C. elegans literature.
This process ensures high quality and consistency of data
and provides an atomized evidence trail for all data
entered into the database, but it is time consuming and
labor intensive.
We continue to reﬁne our curation strategy for greater
eﬃciency, breadth and depth of coverage. Notably, we
have automated nearly 90% of ‘ﬁrst-pass’ curation,
which aims to ﬂag and extract data types contained in
each reference. We implemented these improvements
using a two-tiered approach that combines programmatic
natural language processing with web-based data submis-
sion forms targeted to authors. This process now identiﬁes
27 distinct data types (for details, see http://www
.wormbase.org/wiki/index.php/Curated_data_types). Five
of these data types (alleles, small-scale RNAi experiments,
transgenes, gene interactions and antibodies) are identiﬁed
automatically through use of the text mining system
Textpresso (12). In addition, we employ Textpresso for
fact extraction, notably for curation of Gene Ontology
(GO) cellular component terms (13).
The identiﬁcation and ﬂagging of two data types (small
and large-scale RNAi experiments, and phenotype
analysis) have been automated by Support Vector
Machines (SVMs; 14). We are testing SVMs on all
curated data types and will adopt this method to classify
and index papers for those data types that can be eﬃ-
ciently and reproducibly identiﬁed. For those data types
that are not amenable to SVMs, we are exploring other
statistical methods (such as hidden Markov models and
conditional random ﬁelds) or rule-based methods. For
example, we now use rule-based methods to identify
papers that discuss C. elegans homologs of genes
associated with human disease.
A second reﬁnement has been to integrate the research
community directly into curation. Using our database of
public biographical information, we automatically e-mail
authors of new C. elegans papers, and ask them to use a
concise and time-eﬃcient web form to identify which data
types are relevant to their papers. So far, 413 out of 864
authors have responded, giving us a very large pool of
expert ﬁrst-pass curators and greatly speeding curation.
Community input will further support our switch to an
automated ﬁrst-pass pipeline because it will help us assess
the success and failure rates of automation.
DATA CURATION UPDATE
The most prominent curated data at WormBase are
discussed below and new data types added in the last 2
years are summarized. See http://www.wormbase
.org/wiki/index.php/Curated_data_types for a complete
list of curated data types.
Concise descriptions
WormBase now provides concise summaries for over 5597
genes (25% of the protein-coding genes in C. elegans).
These prose descriptions provide a quick overview of gene
function and are particularly useful for researchers not
familiar with C. elegans as an experimental system.
Genes and sequence changes
WormBase relies on a curation anomaly pipeline to
indicate regions that require attention. This has resulted
in 2094 C. elegans, 150 C. briggsae and 661 C. brenneri
gene structure changes in the last year. These changes
include 127 new C. elegans genes and 443 new C. elegans
isoforms. Most of these changes have been based either on
RNA-Seq transcript data (from 454 or Illumina
sequencing) or on comparative gene analysis. There have
been 11 changes to the C. elegans canonical genomic
sequence made after re-inspection of the original
sequence traces. Ten of these changes were 1 bp in size;
the largest was an insertion of 1469 bp.
Alleles
WormBase now contains over 10 000 alleles with molecular
information, greatly facilitating structure–function studies.
Sequencing eﬀorts in polymorphic strains have now
identiﬁed over 170 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Gene Ontology
WormBase is an active participant of the GO consortium
(http://www.geneontology.org). We continue to expand
the breadth and depth of gene ontology annotation at
WormBase via the association of biological process,
cellular component and molecular function controlled
vocabulary terms to gene products. Associations are
generated by several methods, including manual annota-
tion by curators reading the primary literature, sequence
similarity (e.g. mapping of InterPro motifs to GO terms
provided by the InterPro2GO project) and mapping of
terms from other ontologies to the GO (e.g. mapping of
phenotype terms to GO terms). Currently 1800 unique GO
terms have been associated to over 14 000 genes; the GO
terms for 2000 of these genes have been manually
curated.
Phenotype Ontology
In addition to annotating species other than C. elegans,
WormBase also contains phenotypic and ethological
data from strains of C. elegans that are not Bristol N2.

These strains must be considered as alternative ‘wild type’
rather than mutants. For instance, the wild strains RC301
and CB4932 exhibit clumping behavior that is missing in
N2, but which is common in freshly isolated C. elegans
(15). This has driven us to revise our phenotype ontology
so that it is no longer N2-centric, allowing us to annotate
normal and mutant phenotypes of both new species and
non-N2 elegans strains. We have accordingly replaced the
word ‘abnormal’ in term names and deﬁnitions and its
replacement with the less-biased term ‘variant’. We have
also been actively expanding the phenotype ontology to
reﬂect the richness of described phenotypes. Since the
WS190 release we have added 168 new terms, bringing
the total number of terms to 1845. Eighty-eight percent
of these terms are now deﬁned in detail using uniform
language, compared with 42% coverage in WS190.
This expansion of the available number of terms has
enabled a more complete description of phenotypes for
alleles, transgenes and strains. We increased the number
of alleles with associated phenotype ontology terms
almost 40% since the WS190 release. Currently, 6482
alleles carry phenotype associations; 17 904 allele–pheno-
type associations in total have been generated representing
a major advance in the controlled description of
phenotypes in C. elegans. We have added 122 new
strain–phenotype associations to 36 strains, and 232
transgene–phenotype associations to 101 transgenes.
The improved precision of the phenotype ontology has
prompted both GO and phenotype curators to generate
accurate mappings of Phenotype Ontology to GO terms
using entity–quality (EQ) relationships. This pipeline is
envisioned to generate GO assignments to genes based
on their allele–phenotype assignments.
Anatomy Ontology and function
WormBase has expanded the controlled anatomy
ontology terms and relations among them. This vocabu-
lary includes descriptions of the entire cell lineage of
C. elegans. We have used this ontology to describe the
function of cells and tissues. That is, we describe the
phenotypes caused by physical or genetic perturbation of
anatomic structures. For example, a cell may be physically
ablated or the genes expressed in it may be changed
by tissue-speciﬁc gene expression. To date, we have
annotated 350 such experiments. Complimentary to
anatomy ontology, we are now working to represent
neural anatomic relationships using the network browser
N-Browse (16).
Transcription factor-binding sites
We have expanded WormBase to deal with position-
speciﬁc matrices deﬁning regulatory elements in nematode
genomes, with 58 currently annotated (http://www
.wormbase.org/db/seq/position_matrix/?list=all). Our
data model for matrices can accommodate either fre-
quency counts [in position frequency matrices (PFMs)]
or logarithmically weighted tables [in position weight
matrices (PWMs); 17]. We use the transcription factor-
binding site (TFBS) module of Lenhard and Wasserman
(18) to map frequency to weight data, given a background
nucleotide frequency of 34% CG. We are also increasing
the level of manual curation of experimentally determined
sequence features, including TFBSs.
USER INTERFACE AND SITE INFRASTRUCTURE
In the past 2 years, we have added a number of signiﬁcant
new data displays. For example, Gene Pages now indi-
cate genes implicated in human disease with their corre-
sponding OMIM entry. A new orthology display lists
precalculated ortholog assignments (http://www
.wormbase.org/db/orthology/gene). Finally, we uniﬁed
our display of the three ontologies available at
WormBase (Gene, Phenotype and Anatomy) with a
single search and browsing interface (http://www
.wormbase.org/db/ontology/search).
We routinely evaluate and revise our service
infrastructure to match both size and performance needs
of the database as well as a growing user base. One
approach to meeting increased demand has been the estab-
lishment of mirror sites across the globe. We recently
upgraded our principal mirror at Caltech (http://caltech
.wormbase.org). Behind the scenes, we have expanded our
server pool as necessary to ensure a suitable browsing
experience, employing a robust reverse proxy load-
balancing system to maintain service even in the event of
server failure.
ARCHIVAL RELEASES
With every ﬁfth release of the database (currently an
interval of 6 months) we create and permanently
archive a frozen release of the database and website.
In the past 2 years, we created releases such as WS180,
WS190, WS200 and WS205. Each of these is available
at a unique URL (e.g., http://ws205.wormbase.org).
We encourage users to use and cite these referential
releases of the database.
INTEGRATION WITH THIRD-PARTY RESOURCES
Although the data housed at WormBase is extensive, it is
not comprehensive. When appropriate, we provide cross-
links to external resources for additional information.
For example, we draw data from Reactome (19) to
provide users with detailed pathway and process data
from directly within WormBase.
One notable new partner is the journal Genetics
(http://www.genetics.org). Using the text indexing tool
Textpresso (14), Genetics now automatically markups
new papers, generating links back to WormBase. This
provides online readers of Genetics with expansive infor-
mation on genes, proteins, sequences and phenotypes
directly from a refereed journal article.
WormBase is also tightly linked to the open-access
online publication WormBook (http://www.wormbook
.org; 20). WormBase objects referenced in WormBook
chapters are cross-linked to their corresponding entries
at WormBase. From WormBase, users can navigate

from objects such as genes to more in-depth discussion at
WormBook on a wide range of topics.
COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Finding eﬀective means of communication with end users
is a challenge for all who build and maintain biological
databases. Users are often reluctant or too busy to contact
database maintainers with bug reports, feature requests or
general questions on how to use the site. To address these
concerns, we have established several new channels of
communication with our end users.
A Twitter feed gives us a quick mechanism for letting
users know about site status (http://www.twitter.com/
wormbase). A separate feed allows interested parties to
follow updates to our core software (http://twitter
.com/wormbase_commit).
The general aggregator FriendFeed (http://friendfeed
.org/wormbase) provides both an easy method for users
to stay up-to-date with happenings at the site and as a
real-time Help Desk. Users can post questions to the
WormBase FriendFeed and receive nearly instantaneous
response from WormBase staﬀ. Instead of being seques-
tered on a mailing list, this feedback is publicly available
and searchable for the beneﬁt of all users.
Finally, the Worm Community Forum (http://www
.wormbase.org/forums) gives users a place for general
discussion related to nematode biology, including experi-
mental protocols, reagents, microscopy and even job
postings and meeting details. The forum now has over
800 members and receives several posts per day.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We are actively developing the next generation of the
WormBase website. Design considerations take into
account scalability and usability employing modern web
interface design and navigation patterns. Development of
a comprehensive Perl API to all databases and services
that comprise WormBase forms the core of this
rearchitecture. A subset of this API will be accessible as
a RESTful (21) web service. This new interface will give
users a high degree of ﬂexibility in how they navigate and
interrogate the data available at WormBase, as well as
give other database providers an easy mechanism to
embed WormBase data in their own web sites. Beta-
testing will begin in late Fall 2009.
In the coming year, we will add a number of signiﬁcant
new data sets and visualizations. First, WormBase will
incorporate all data generated under the modENCODE
(http://modencode.org/) project, making it available on
the C. elegansGenome Browser. Second, we will add addi-
tional genomes to the resource, including the ruminant
pathogen Haemonchus contortus. Third, we will begin
curating metabolic process and pathway data using the
BioCyc format (22). Interested users will be able to
perform metabolic analyses using up-to-date nematode
genomes and annotations. Finally, in an eﬀort to make
the substantial amount of microarray data already avail-
able in WormBase easier to query, we will deploy a
SPELL (Serial Patterns of Expression Levels Locator)
database and interface (23).
