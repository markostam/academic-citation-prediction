ABSTRACT
Fundamental control over supra-molecular self-
assembly for organization of matter on the nano-
scale is a major objective of nanoscience and
nanotechnology. ‘RNA tectonics’ is the design of
modular RNA units, called tectoRNAs, that can be pro-
grammedtoself-assemble intonovelnano- andmeso-
scopic architectures of desired size and shape. We
report the three-dimensional design of tectoRNAs
incorporating modular 4-way junction (4WJ) motifs,
hairpin loops and their cognate loop–receptors to
create extended, programmable interaction inter-
faces. Specific and directional RNA–RNA interactions
at these interfaces enable conformational, topologi-
cal and orientational control of tectoRNA self-
assembly. The interacting motifs are precisely
positioned within the helical arms of the 4WJ to pro-
gram assembly from only one helical stacking con-
formation of the 4WJ. TectoRNAs programmed to
assemble with orientational compensation produce
micrometer-scale RNA filaments through supra-
molecular equilibrium polymerization. As visualized
by transmission electron microscopy, these RNA fila-
ments resemble actin filaments from the protein
world. This work emphasizes the potential of RNA
as a scaffold for designing and engineering new con-
trollable biomaterials mimicking modern cytoskeletal
proteins.
INTRODUCTION
Biological systems rely almost exclusively on supra-molecular
self-assembly to create complex supra-molecular structures
that carry out diverse functions (1). Key characteristics of
these systems are hierarchical organization, modular
components and stereochemically specific interactions. The
application of self-assembly principles gleaned from biologi-
cal systems provides ways to achieve greater control over the
design and construction of self-assembling molecular objects
to produce artificial nano- and meso-scale devices to meet new
chemical and biomedical challenges in the 21st century (2,3).
In the past 20 years, Seeman and co-workers explored nano-
scale design principles using DNA. They have constructed
geometrical objects on the nano-scale, including planar figures
(4), regular polyhedrons (5,6) and knotted structures (7). More
recently, they and others have used DNA double and triple
cross-over junctions to construct rigid modular units (tiles) (8),
programmed to self-assemble to generate two-dimensional
(2D) patterned arrays (9,10) as well as various tubular struc-
tures (11–16). By introducing motifs that switch between alter-
native structures, DNA nanomechanical devices powered by
‘fuel strands’ have also been constructed (17). While these
DNA structures have great potential for developing pro-
grammable, geometrically regular materials or templates for
nanotechnology applications such as wiring nano-scale cir-
cuitry (11,13), the limitations of DNA as a biopolymer for
mimicking biological functions carried out by proteins and
RNA are also apparent.
While more chemically labile than DNA, natural RNAs
comprise the working components of biologically important
molecular machines, capable of using cellular energy in the
form of ATP or GTP to perform mechanical work and to carry
out complex tasks of information processing, such as template-
directed protein synthesis (18–21) and multiplexed gene regu-
lation (22–27). Natural RNAs are dynamic molecules that
undergo large structural changes in carrying out specific func-
tions. As such, they make use of a large variety of recurrent,
modular and pre-organized structural motifs that mediate
stereochemically precise and readily reversible, tertiary
intra- and inter-molecular interactions (28,29). Analysis of
the rapidly growing structural and sequence databases for
RNA has revealed novel RNA–RNA interaction motifs and
new topological rules for RNA three-dimensional (3D)

assembly (29–34). ‘RNA tectonics’ refers to the application of
the structural principles of modular design and hierarchical
folding inferred from natural RNAs to create new nano- and
meso-scopic self-assembling architectures (28,35,36). RNA is
readily amenable to inverse folding: supra-molecular struc-
tures can be ‘sketched’ in 3D space by positioning modular
motifs that mediate tertiary interactions to create the desired
nano-scale architecture and then connecting the motifs using
semi-rigid double helical ‘struts’. Consequently, the design
can be translated into an appropriate sequence designed to
fold uniquely to form the desired structure (28,35–42). The
positioning of structural elements can be controlled precisely,
by adjusting the lengths of helices and their stacking arrange-
ments at multi-helix junctions (28,35–37,39–41,43–45).
In previous works, we described the design of dimers
(35,37,41,42), H-shaped (37) and square-shaped (36,45)
modular RNA units, called tectoRNAs, that assemble into
various nano-structures such as small RNA nanoparticles,
one-dimensional (1D) and 2D arrays as well as addressable
nano-grids of finite dimensions. Here, we present the first
design and synthesis of RNA molecular units based on H-
shaped molecules that self-assemble in a fully controllable
manner to form oriented filaments. The self-assembly of
these molecules is mediated by the positioning of specific
hairpin loops and corresponding loop–receptors to create
directional interfaces for non-covalent RNA–RNA interac-
tions (35,37,41,42).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design and 3D modeling of H-shaped tectoRNAs
The sequence of each H-shaped tectoRNA was designed to
avoid alternative secondary structure folds as previously descr-
ibed (35,36). Sequence designs were checked for proper
folding by comparing the desired secondary structure with
that predicted by mfold (www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/
mfold) (46). Atomic 3D models of H-shaped tectoRNAs
were manually constructed ‘in silico’ using MANIP (47) by
connecting the 4-way junction (4WJ) extracted from the X-ray
structure of the hairpin ribozyme (48) with two GAAA
tetraloops and two 11 nt receptor modules extracted from
the structure of the P4–P6 domain of the group I intron (49)
using regular A-form RNA helices. Assembling interfaces
were modeled according to previous 3D models of self-
dimerizing tectoRNAs (35,37) to generate supra-molecular
assemblies of molecules 1 and 2. All the structural models
were stereochemically refined with MANIP (47).
RNA preparation
All RNA molecules were prepared in vitro by T7 RNA
polymerase run-off transcription of PCR generated templates
as described previously (35,36) (see Supplementary Table A-1
for the complete list of synthetic DNA oligos used for
making DNA templates for transcription). The migration of
RNA on polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) was typically monitored
by using 32P-labeled RNA, either body labeled with
[a-32P]ATP or labeled at the 30 end with [50-32P]pCp as
described (35).
RNA self-assembly and native PAGE
RNA samples containing a fixed amount of body labeled RNA
(2 nM) or RNA labeled on the 30 end with [50-32P]pCp
(0.1 nM) and sufficient unlabeled RNA to give the desired
RNA concentrations were heated in water at 90C for 1 min,
immediately cooled on ice for 2 min and then allowed to
assemble for 15–30 min at 30C in 89 mM Tris-borate
(pH 8.3), 15 mM or 30 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 5% glycerol.
For analysis, 10 ml of the RNA sample was combined with
1 ml of gel-loading buffer (same buffer with 0.01% bromophe-
nol blue, 0.01% xylene cyanol) and run at 4C typically on 7%
(29:1) non-denaturing PAGE. The gel and running buffers
were identical to those used for assembly except that glycerol
was not included. Native gel electrophoresis was typically run
for 3 h or overnight, with buffer recirculation, at 4C in the
cold room. The gels were dried and autoradiographed using
X-ray film or a phosphoimager screen. For Kd measurements,
monomer and dimer bands were quantified on a phosphor-
imager and the dimer formation was correlated with RNA
concentration. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were
determined as the concentration at which half of the RNA
molecules are dimerized (35).
Transmission electron microscopy
Unlabeled RNA samples for transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) were prepared as described above in presence of 15 or
50 mM Mg(OAc)2. A volume of 4 ml of self-assembled tec-
toRNA was placed on collodion-coated grids for 1 min. The
sample was then washed in four sequential steps with solutions
of 25, 50, 75% of ethanol in H2O and 100% ethanol: each
washing step consisted of 10 drops of wash solution dripped
over the sample. The sample was then dried and tungsten-
shadowed under high vacuum at 32 mA for 10 min and
imaged at different nominal magnifications on a TEM
(TEM JEOL100CX) at the Bowling Green State University
EM Center. For comparison purposes, at least two samples
were made with different [RNA] and/or [Mg2+] for each
molecule. These control grids underwent the same treatment
as the regular samples.
RESULTS
H-shaped tectoRNA nomenclature
In previous work we introduced tectoRNA molecules designed
to self-assemble at interfaces comprising pairs of RNA tertiary
loop–receptor interactions (35,37). RNA hairpin loop/receptor
interactions, while stereochemically precise and specific, are
weak, and must be combined in pairs to be used for inter-
molecular association at low (sub-micromolar) concentrations.
These H-shaped tectoRNAs comprise a 4WJ that organizes
four interacting modules, GNRA tetraloops (L) or their cog-
nate receptors (R), into two co-axially stacked domains (Heli-
cal Stacking domains: ‘HS’ domains).
Each tectoRNA can in principle interact with two other
tectoRNAs through the formation of four loop–receptor inter-
actions, two with each partner molecule. Due to the flexibility
of the 4WJ motif, each molecule can adopt two different
conformers, A and B (Figure 1A), which differ in the stacking
arrangement of the helices at the 4WJ. For conformer

A, helical stack 1 (HS1) comprises helices 1 and 2 while
helical stack 2 (HS2) comprises helices 3 and 4; for conformer
B, HS1 comprises helices 1 and 4 and HS2 helices 2 and 3.
Thus, HS1 is defined as the stacking domain that contains helix
1, defined as the helix with the 50 and 30 ends, and HS2 is
defined to contain helix 3.
There are six ways of arranging the interacting modules for
H-shaped tectoRNAs that each contains two loops and two
receptors such that the first receptor is necessarily placed in the
terminal stem 1 (Figure 1B). These correspond to three strand
topologies, each of which generates two conformers by iso-
merization of the 4WJ. The following short hand notation will
be used to designate the various topologies and conformations
for each of the molecules described in this article. Starting
from the 50 end, each RNA module is listed as it appears
sequentially. ‘Ri’ and ‘Li’ designate the interacting receptor
and loop modules of type i, and the double forward slash, ‘//’,
indicates the 4WJ, where the strand crosses from one HS
domain to the other (see Figure 1B). A single forward
slash, ‘/’, indicates helices belonging to the same HS domain

circle, can be positioned upward (‘u’) or downward (‘d’) with respect to the axis of assembly propagation. Assembly can occur with ‘up-up’ (‘u-u’ or equivalently
‘d-d’) or ‘up-down’ (‘u-d’, i.e. alternating) orientation of two adjacent molecules with respect to the axis of propagation. (B) Schematic of all the possible strand

(see Figure 1B). We will designate the distances in base pairs
separating each starred interacting module from the 4WJ by
providing an additional annotation of the form n1/n2//n3/n4,
where ‘ni’ indicates the distance in base pairs of the motif of
helix i from the 4WJ, and ‘/’ and ‘//’ have the same meaning
(Figures 1C and 2A). Thus, the complete annotation for
describing molecule 9 in Figure 2 is Ra/Rb//Lb/La (5/6//5/
6). Note that La is GAAA and Lb is GGAA.
Non-directional tectoRNA assembly
In the previous report (37), two different molecules were
designed, each favoring one of the two 4WJ conformers, A
or B (molecules 1 and 2 in Figure 2A). This was done by using
the 4WJ motif of the hairpin ribozyme for which the sequence-
dependent stacking preference is known (48,50). Molecule 1
favors conformer A and assembles with HS1 interacting exclu-
sively with HS2 but randomly with respect to the axis of self-
assembly propagation, in ‘up-down’ as well as ‘up-up’ (or
‘down-down’) fashion (Figure 1A). On the other hand, mole-
cule 2 in conformer B is programmed to assemble in a strictly
alternating ‘up-down’ fashion. However, random 180 rota-
tion about the molecular axis perpendicular to the axis of
propagation is possible, resulting in association through any
combination of HS1 and HS2 in the interacting molecules
(HS1:HS1, HS1:HS2 and HS2:HS2) (see Figure 1A). Thus,
neither molecule 1 nor molecule 2 assemble with directional
control.
As shown by native gel electrophoresis, molecule 1 multi-
merizes to form a range of products whereas molecule 2 only
forms dimers [see (37) and Figure 4]. To better understand
these differences in assembly, 3D atomic models of each
molecule were generated and used to predict the outcome
of oligomerization behavior for each possible combination
of interfaces (Figure 3). Models show that molecules based
on molecule 1 in conformation A that were designed to assem-
ble directionally with ‘up-down’ alternation, should form left-
handed supra-molecular filaments with a pitch of about eight
molecules per supra-molecular turn (Figure 3B). 3D model
building studies also show that ‘up-up’ (or ‘down-down’)
assembly of molecule 1 leads to minor steric clashes if
there is no change in the 4WJ conformations (data not
shown). The interruption of sequential ‘up-down’ assembly
by ‘up-up’ (or ‘down-down’) orientations of neighboring units
generates kinks of the supra-molecular axis of 45. 3D model
building studies on molecule 2 shows that of the three con-
ceivable modes of self-assembly (i.e. HS1:HS1, HS1:HS2 and
HS2:HS2) only HS1:HS2 can occur without producing serious
steric clashes (Figure 3C). However, the dimers that result
from HS1:HS2 interactions cannot grow further without pro-
ducing major steric clashes. These clashes cannot be overcome
by changing the conformation of the 4WJ.
In order to confirm our model building studies, we have now
characterized these two tectoRNA assemblies by TEM and
AFM (43). For molecule 1, filaments no longer than 200
nm are observed by both techniques (for TEM, see Figure
5, top left). These are frequently interrupted by 45
bends, corroborating the prediction. In addition, clusters of
various sizes are observed (Figure 5, top left). In contrast,
TEM for molecule 2 showed much smaller granular objects
with size corresponding to dimers (Figure 5, top right).
Engineering directional tectoRNA assembly
Because molecules 1 and 2 assemble in a non-directional
manner, they produce complex heterogeneous assembly prod-
ucts that are difficult to characterize. To obtain oriented 1D
molecular arrays, two problems have to be overcome. First, it
is necessary to limit assembly to one of the two possible
conformers (A or B, Figure 1A). Second, each assembly inter-
face has to be coded for unique and directional assembly.
TectoRNAs based on the 4WJ from the hairpin ribozyme
favor one stacking conformation over the other by at most a
few kcal/mol (50–52). For association to occur optimally,
however, the distance between interacting motifs should be
11 bp—roughly the length of one RNA helical turn. For HS
domains containing a GNRA loop in one helix and a loop–
receptor in the other, this is the distance measured in bp
between the GA trans Hoogsteen/Sugar-edge base pair in
the GNRA hairpin loops and the GC Watson–Crick base
pair within the receptors (both bps are marked by red stars
for each tectoRNA design in Figure 2). For HS domains con-
taining two loops or two receptors, this is the distance between
the starred GA base pairs of the two loops or the starred GCs of
the two receptors. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for
different interfaces were measured using tectoRNAs designed
with a single interface, so as to form dimers (Figure 2B). For
interfaces with interacting GAAA loop/receptor motifs sepa-
rated by the optimal distance 11 bp, the measured Kd was 4 nM
(molecule 3). When this distance was changed to 10 or 12 bp
(molecules 3a and 3b in Figure 2B), the Kd increased from 4 to
80 or 110 nM, respectively (Figure 2C). No association was
observed for a separation distance of 13 bp under similar
conditions (molecule 3c in Figure 2B). Therefore, to favor
H-shaped tectoRNA association in one conformer (A or B)
over association in the other, the positioning of the 4WJ must
be adjusted so that the distance separating the interacting
modules in each HS domain is exactly 11 bp only in the desired
conformer (Figure 1D). Molecule 7 was derived from mole-
cule 1 by moving HS2 one base pair down relative to the 4WJ
(Figure 2A), so as to disfavor assembly from the alternate
conformer B. Molecule 7, like molecule 1, assembles non-
directionally and forms a variety of products (Figure 4A).
To create tectoRNA that assemble with directional control,
an additional loop/loop–receptor pair was incorporated into the
design. This makes it possible to create directional interfaces.
The new interaction used in this work is the GGAA tetraloop
(Lb) recognized by a receptor called C7.34 (Rb), previously
selected by in vitro evolution (53) (Figure 2). In the mono-
valent dimer tectoRNA context, the Kd for the Rb/Lb homo-
dimer is 40 nM (molecule 4), 10 times higher than the Ra/La
homodimer (molecule 3) (Figure 2B). However, for the hetero-
dimer resulting from Rb/La (molecule 5) interacting with Ra/
Lb (molecule 6), the Kd is from 6 to 8 nM (41). This tectoRNA
assembly is at least 20 times more selective for GGAA than
any other GNRA loops, including GAAA. Indeed, molecules
5 and 6 self-dimerize with Kd > 2 mM and > 10 mM, res-
pectively, as both homodimers require formation of two
non-cognate interactions. The five basic constructs that were
generated using two specific loop–receptor pairs are shown in
Figure 1E with their modes of interaction: they all incorporate
the design features described above and are expected to form
polar and directional assemblies.

Assembly of R/R//L/L tectoRNAs to form filaments
Two new molecules (8 and 9) were derived from molecule 7
by incorporating the second hairpin loop, GGAA (‘Lb’), and
its specific receptor, ‘Rb’ (Figure 2A). In molecule 8, which is
of type Ra/Rb//Lb/La, each hairpin and its cognate receptor are
positioned on the same side of the 4WJ with respect to the axis
of propagation of the assembly (Figure 1E). For molecule 9,

which is of type Ra/Rb//La/Lb, the positions of the loops, La
and Lb, are switched compared to molecule 8 (Figure 1E).
Thus, molecule 8 assembles directionally with each successive
monomer in the same (‘up’) orientation, while molecule 9
assembles directionally with ‘up-down’ alternation. Interest-
ingly, molecule 9 assembles in a highly concentration-
dependent manner to form long fibers at mM RNA concentra-
tions that are very sensitive to [Mg2+] (Figure 4A). Molecule 8,
on the other hand, assembles into specific oligomeric com-
plexes even at low Mg2+ and sub-nanomolar RNA concentra-
tions (Figure 4A). We have determined that the smallest
complex formed by molecule 8 is a trimer (B. Hassan,
M. Mirzoyan, K. Afonin, L. Nasalean, L. Jaeger and
N. Leontis manuscript in preparation). A larger complex of
molecule 8 forms at micromolar RNA concentrations and is
favored by higher [Mg2+] and appears by gel electrophoresis to
consist of 5–7 U (Figure 4A). The formation of a closed
complex is corroborated by TEM studies of molecule 8,
which show toroidal structures of uniform size, 6 nm in
diameter, and thus larger than the dimer complexes of mole-
cule 2 (Figure 5, middle right). The formation of closed trimer
complexes is also corroborated by 3D modeling: closed trimer
complexes can form easily by adjustment of the angle of the
4WJ to allow the HS domains, HS1 and HS2, in each tec-
toRNA unit to achieve a nearly parallel configuration. This
conformational change makes it possible for each pair of tec-
toRNAs in the trimer to form two cooperative loop–receptor
interactions (B. Hassan, M. Mirzoyan, K. Afonin, L. Nasalean,
L. Jaeger and N. Leontis manuscript in preparation).
TEM characterization shows that molecule 9, in contrast
with molecule 8, forms filaments that are up to 1 mm in length,
much straighter than those formed by molecule 1 and tend to
align side-by-side to form loose sheets (Figure 5, middle and
bottom left). Molecule 9 was designed to assemble uniformly
and directionally with ‘up-down’ alternation, whereas

These 3D models correspond to assemblies [u-d (HS1:HS2)] that maintain
the structure of the 4WJ (in violet) as observed in the hairpin ribozyme
X-ray structure without producing any inter-molecular steric clashes. In these
models, HS1 (containing R1) of 1 U interacts with HS2 (containing L1) of
another unit so that the interacting motifs R1–L1 (in red) and R2–L2 (in green)
can associate.

molecule 1 monomers can be added to the ends of filaments
with ‘up-up’ or ‘up-down’ orientation. The discrete RNA
bands observed by gel for assembly of molecules 1 and 7
are thus probably due to random insertion of monomers
with ‘up-up’ orientation which results in steric clashes that
limit the further growth of the filaments, consistent with 3D
modeling discussed above.
Other molecules were derived from molecules 8 and 9 by
changing the positioning of the 4WJ relative to the interacting
motifs (see Supplementary Table A-2) and found to assemble
into clusters or filaments. However, none of these molecules
formed filaments as long or as straight as the parent molecule
9 at 15 mM Mg2+ (see Supplementary Table A-2). Substitution
of one of the GAAA tetraloops of molecule 9 by a terminating
loop (UUCG tetraloop) completely prevented association
(molecule 10 in Figure 2A), indicating that two intact specific
loop–receptor interactions are needed for assembly at micro-
molar or lower concentrations. UNCG loops have very differ-
ent tertiary structures and do not bind to GNRA receptors.
Assembly of R//R/L//L tectoRNAs to form filaments
Based on our experience with molecules 8 and 9, it became
apparent that molecule 2, Ra//Ra/La//La (5//6/5//6), could also
be engineered to form filaments because of the ‘up-down’
alternation that occurs when the R//R/L//L conformer assem-
bles. According to 3D modeling, assembly of R//R/L//L mole-
cules could be promoted by changing the position of the 4WJ
relative to the interacting motifs so as to avoid steric clashes
while also preventing assembly from the alternate conformer,
and by introducing a second loop–receptor motif to prevent
interface promiscuity. We created a series of molecules in
which the HS2 domain was moved 1 bp at a time relative
to the HS1 domain at the 4WJ. The first molecule in this series,
molecule 11, Ra//Rb/La//Lb (5//5/6//6), was derived from
molecule 2 by moving HS2 down 1 bp to disfavor assembly
from the alternate conformer and by introducing the second
specific loop/receptor pair, Lb/Rb, to prevent HS1:HS1 or
HS2:HS2 association (Figures 1E and 2A). Thus, molecule
11 only assembles with alternating ‘up-down’ orientation
through interaction of HS1:HS2 interfaces. This results in
directional assembly similar to molecule 9 and, not unexpect-
edly, molecule 11 also forms concentration-dependent multi-
mers (equilibrium polymers) on native gels. At low
concentration, molecule 11 forms dimers, but as the RNA
concentration increases equilibrium polymers are observed
(Figure 4B). Interestingly, the next molecule in the series,
molecule 12, Ra//Rb/La//Lb (5//4/7//6), forms longer multi-
mers, more closely resembling those of molecule 9 of the R/R//
L/L series (Figure 4B). Only slight further improvements in
the length of filaments were observed for molecules 13 and 14
(Figure 4B), which were derived from 12 by moving HS1 one
base pair up with respect to HS2 at the 4WJ, giving the geome-
try Ra//Rb/La//Lb (6//4/7//5) (see Figure 2A). As shown by
TEM (Figure 5, bottom right), molecule 13, like molecule 9,
forms long and regular filaments that also show a tendency to
align with each other. Molecules 13 and 14 differ by a 180
rotation of the local sequence of the 4WJ motif relative to the
helical arms (see Figure 2A and Supplementary Table A-2).
This change maintains the same stacking geometry in mole-
cules 13 and 14. As both molecules behave similarly, this
suggests that the structure of the 4WJ has a 2-fold rotational
pseudo-symmetry (C2). Similar results were obtained for 4WJ
variants of molecules 8 and 9 (molecules 8c and 9d—see
Supplementary Table A-2). As for R/R//L/L tectoRNAs,
assembly of R//R/L//L variants requires two intact loop–
receptor interactions at each interaction interface. Substitution
of one interacting tetraloop of molecule 13 by a non-
interacting UUCG loop (molecule 15 in Figure 2A) abolished
the association.
Assembly of R//L/L//R and R/L//L/R tectoRNAs to form
filaments
We drew on our new understanding of the rules and modes of
self-assembly of molecules belonging to the R/R//L/L and R//
R/L//L series to design additional tectoRNA molecules with
R//L/L//R and R/L//L/R strand topologies, also capable of
forming extended filaments. Despite different strand topology,
molecule 16, Ra//Lb/La//Rb (6//6/5//5) is structurally equiva-
lent to molecule 9, Ra/Rb//La/Lb (5/6//6/5) with helical stems
1, 2, 3 and 4 of molecule 16 corresponding to helical stems 2,
3, 4 and 1 of molecule 9 (Figures 1E and 2A). Thus, the
conserved GC Watson–Crick base pair of the receptors and
the GA Hoogsteen/Sugar-edge base pair of the GNRA tetra-
loops of 16 are superimposed with those of 9, positioning these
interacting elements at the same distance from the 4WJ. In the
same way, molecules 13 and 17 are structurally equivalent,
with helical stems 1, 2, 3 and 4 of molecule 13 corresponding
to helical stems 4, 1, 2 and 3 of molecule 17 (Figures 1E and
2A). The receptors, Ra and Rb, as well as the loops, La and Lb,

are swapped in molecule 16 relative to their positions in mole-
cule 9, and likewise for 17 vis-a`-vis 13.
Molecules 16 and 17, like 9 and 13, are asymmetric as
regards the distances of the interacting motifs from the
4WJ. For molecules 9 and 16, the distance is 5 bp for helices
on one side of the 4WJ, shown in blue in Figure 6A, and 6 bp
for helices on the other side of the 4WJ, shown in red. One
must pay attention to this asymmetry to define, in a consistent
manner, the relative orientations of molecules when they
assemble. We arbitrarily designate as ‘up’ the ‘blue’ side of
molecules 8, 9 and 16, i.e. the side in which the interacting
motifs are positioned 5 bp from the 4WJ. To highlight its
structural equivalence to molecule 9, the secondary structure
of molecule 16 is also shown rotated 180 in Figure 2A, with
helix 1 (containing the 50 and 30 ends) pointing downward and
helices 2 and 3, which have motifs positioned 5 bp from the
4WJ, oriented upward. This orients the ‘blue’ helices of 16
toward the top of the page consistent with Figure 6A.
For molecules 13 and 17, the helices that have the receptors
positioned 4 and 6 bp from the 4WJ are assigned the ‘up’
orientation.
Because molecules 16 and 17 are structurally equivalent to
9 and 13, respectively, they also assemble with ‘up-down’
alternation and, as shown by native PAGE, both form very
long filaments when assembled at mM RNA concentrations
in the presence of 15 mM magnesium ions, as predicted (see
Figure 6C for molecule 16 and Figure 4B for molecule 17).
This experiment corroborates the determining role of ‘up-
down’ alternation in the assembly of H-shaped tectoRNA to
form extended filaments.
Assembly with mixtures of H-shaped tectoRNAs
To explore the generality of these ideas concerning the role of
orientational compensation, we examined the behavior of mix-
tures of tectoRNA molecules. When molecule 8 is mixed with
9, both ‘up-up’ and ‘up-down’ associations are expected to
occur, as shown in Figure 6B, in which bold blue arrows are

and modes of interaction: The blue color indicates the helical arms in which the distance separating the interacting motifs from the 4WJ is 5 bp and the red color

and 8 or 9 and 16 self-assemble with both ‘up-up’ and ‘up-down’ associations. (B) Detailed schematic of ‘up-up’ and ‘up-down’ interactions in the assembly of

used to indicate the ‘up’ orientation of each molecule as it
assembles. Thus, HS2 of molecule 8 should associate with
HS1 of molecule 9 in ‘up-up’ (or ‘down-down’) fashion,
while HS2 of molecule 9 should associate with HS1 of mole-
cule 8 with ‘up-down’ alternation (see also Figure 6A). Based
on these considerations, we expected mixtures of 8 and 9 to
form blocked or possibly closed complexes, rather than fila-
ments such as those molecule 9 forms alone. Furthermore, we
expected complexes formed by 8 and 9 to be larger than those
formed by 8 alone. Native PAGE shows that indeed equimolar
mixtures of molecules 8 and 9 form discrete complexes that
are larger than the trimers formed by 8 alone (Figure 6C). Use
of radiolabeled molecules 8 and 9 in separate experiments
demonstrates that both molecules are present in these larger
complexes (Figure 6C). Using radiolabeled molecule 8, one
sees that, at sufficiently high concentrations of molecule 9, the
cooperative trimer complexes of molecule 8 are disrupted in
favor of the larger complexes that incorporate molecule 9.
Similar considerations indicated that mixing molecules 9
and 16 should also produce discrete complexes, even though in
this case both 9 and 16 individually produce long filaments.
Indeed, HS2 of 9 should associate with HS1 of 16 in uncom-
pensated ‘up-up’ fashion. Likewise, HS2 of 16 and HS1 of 9
should associate ‘up-up’. As for molecules 8 and 9, ‘up-up’ for
molecules 9 and 16 means that the molecules associate so that
their interacting motifs are positioned the same distance from
the 4WJ. Thus, mixtures of 9 and 16 should produce the same
results as 9 and 8, and indeed mixtures of 9 and 16 also
produce discrete complexes having identical gel mobilities
as those produced by mixtures of 9 and 8 (Figure 6C).
The ‘up-up’ (or ‘down-down’) associations that result when
9 and 16 interact, disrupt the strict ‘up-down’ alternation that
produces the filaments formed when either 9 or 16 assemble
alone. The ‘up-up’ interactions in the 9 + 16 mixtures intro-
duce a curvature in the filaments that shorten their lengths and
may even allow closed complexes to form, as occurs for mole-
cule 8. Figure 6B shows that identical patterns of ‘up-up’ and
‘up-down’ assembly are possible when 9 is mixed with either 8
or 16. This diagram presents, for illustrative purposes only,
one possible sequence of assembly that molecule 9 can form
with both molecule 8 and molecule 16, to account for the fact
that both mixtures form discrete complexes with identical gel
mobilities. The exact order in which these molecules assemble
to form the discrete complexes observed in the gels is the
subject of future work (Figure 6C).
DISCUSSION
In previous studies (37,43), we showed that H-shaped tec-
toRNA molecules can form supra-molecular 1D assemblies
using lateral tertiary interactions. However, these assemblies
were not homogeneous. In this article we have shown how to
modify the original H-shaped tectoRNA designs to create
programmable, polar and directional 1D arrays.
In polar tectoRNA arrays, the HS1 domain of each tec-
toRNA associates only with the HS2 domain of the preceding
tectoRNA. In directional arrays, the tectoRNA units are pro-
grammed to associate exclusively ‘up-up’ or ‘up-down’ at the
interaction interfaces. If the interacting interfaces of HS1 and
HS2 were related by an exact pseudo-dyad symmetry of 180
with respect to the perpendicular molecular axis, the resulting
linear assemblies would be straight regardless whether the
molecular units assemble with ‘up-up’ or ‘up-down’ orienta-
tion [Figure 7A and C, case (a)]. Recently, artificial three-helix
and six-helix bundle DNA tiles were reported that belong to
this category and assemble into programmable linear arrays
(13,14).
As H-shaped tectoRNA molecules are fully asymmetric
structures with interaction interfaces that are not oriented
exactly 180 to each other, assemblies of molecules designed
to associate with ‘up-up’ orientation generate a curvature that
is not locally compensated along the axis of propagation of the
Figure 7. Modes of assembly of tectoRNA molecules comprising two HS
domains (shown as connected circles) and having complementary interaction
interfaces (shown in red). The up versus down orientations are distinguished by
the blue circle or dot at the position of the 4WJ, connecting the two HS domains.
(A) In the hypothetical case of perfectly opposed interacting interfaces, straight
filaments are produced by either ‘up-up’ (left) or alternating ‘up-down’ (right)
self-assembly. (B) In the actual case that the interfaces are not perfectly op-
posed, ‘up-up’ assembly produces curvature (left) while alternating up-down
assembly compensates the asymmetry at the interfaces (right). Note that chan-
ging the angle between interfaces affects the radius of curvature in ‘up-up’
assembles while ‘up-down’ assemblies remain straight. (C) Hypothetical fila-
ments produced by simple translation (a) of units with perfectly opposed inter-
faces. (b) Closed complexes produced by ‘up-up’ assembly confined to a single
plane. (c) Helices with large helical radius (rh) and short helical pitch (ph)
produced by ‘up-up’ assembly. (d) Extended helices with small radius and
long pitch produced by ‘up-down’ alternation. Association of parallel filaments
to form bundles or intertwined helices is also shown for cases (a) and (d).

resulting filament (Figure 7B). Evidently, for molecule 8, the
assembly is confined to a plane so that closed, cooperative
complexes form (Figure 7B). In contrast, tectoRNAs that were
programmed to associate exclusively with ‘up-down’ alterna-
tion consistently formed microfilaments at sufficiently high
RNA concentrations, as long as steric clashes were avoided
at successive interfaces. In this case, local compensation
occurs in the orientation of the chiral tectoRNA units with
respect to the axis of propagation of the filament, and straight
filaments can form as observed for molecule 9 (Figure 7B).
Thus, introduction of 180 orientational compensation at the
interaction interface appears to eliminate one source of
asymmetry (Figure 7B), favoring the production of mm-long
filaments with left-handed supra-molecular helical shapes,
according to modeling studies (Figure 3B and L. Jaeger and
N. Leontis, unpublished results).
In 1950, Crane (54) identified a fundamental principle of
self-assembly—that helices are the simplest infinite linear
arrays of repeating units, as they result from the application
of a general rotatory-translation operation. Drawing on
Crane’s work, Linus Pauling in 1953 (55) considered the
types of structures that can form when protein molecules
self-assemble using two complementary binding sites (sur-
faces). He noted that if the pitch of the helix (ph) is less
than the width of the molecule in the direction of the axis
of the helix, steric hindrance prevents formation of a filament
and finite, ‘blocked,’ asymmetric oligomers form. When the
pitch of the helix is nearly zero and the rotational operation
that transforms each subunit into its neighbor is nearly 360
divided by an integer, n, the combined flexibility in the inter-
molecular interactions and in the internal conformation of the
subunits may produce closed complexes in the form of a ring,
with n subunits and n inter-subunit bonds [shown schemati-
cally for the general case (b) in Figure 7C]. Such complexes
have an n-fold symmetry axis. This is the case for molecule
8, which forms a closed trimer complex (B. Hassan,
M. Mirzoyan, K. Afonin, L. Nasalean, L. Jaeger and
N. Leontis, manuscript in preparation).
When the pitch of the helix is approximately equal to the
thickness of the molecule in the direction of the axis of the
helix and the molecules in successive turns of the helix can
bond with each other, a fibril stabilized by longitudinal
associations may result. Tubular, possibly hollow, structures
form, depending on the number of subunits per turn and their
diameters relative to that of the helix [Figure 7C, case (c)].
If the pitch of the helix is approximately equal to an integral
multiple of the diameter of a molecule in the direction of
the axis of the helix, a tubular fibril involving two or more
interpenetrating helices may form. Most natural linear
assemblies of proteins, including microtubules and bacterial
flagella, are tubular in structure (56–58). Interestingly, artifi-
cial programmable DNA nanotubes belonging to this
category were recently reported that form as a consequence
of bending within their component double or triple cross-over
tiles (11,12,16). However, their shapes are not fully control-
lable, as they assemble to form hollow nanotubes of variable
circumferences (12).
Tighter, narrower filaments, without a central hollow can be
built by orienting the binding surfaces so that only a small
number of subunits compose each turn [Figure 7C, case (d)]
(59). The filaments produced by tectoRNA molecules 9, 13, 16
and 17 belong to this category, as do thin filaments, which are
principally composed of actin (60,61), intermediate filaments
(62) and most, if not all, reported artificial linear assemblies of
engineered peptide and proteins (56,63,64). Like intermediate
filaments, most of these engineered filaments are not polar
and the individual filaments generally aggregate to form
bundles ranging from 50 to 100 nm in diameter (56). In
contrast, tectoRNA filaments with ‘up-down’ alternation are
polar and directional like actin assemblies. The intrinsic twist
of the 4WJ of each subunit produces left-handed supra-
molecular helices with a small radius and long pitch, with
up to 8 U per helical turn. F-actin forms a left-handed
supra-molecular helix with 13 actin molecules per 6 helical
turns. The rotation per molecule along the filament axis is
close to 166 (almost 180). The pitch of the actin helix is
one molecular diameter and each molecule interacts longitu-
dinally with the molecules in neighboring helical turns. In fact,
these longitudinal interactions appear to be more extensive
than the lateral interactions that produce the generic helix
(61). Thus, the actin helix appears morphologically as two
right-handed, steep helices that twine slowly round each
other [see Figure 7C, case (d)].
CONCLUSION
The modular structure and hierarchical assembly properties of
RNA make it very amenable to rational design for nano- and
meso-scopic construction using supra-molecular assembly
(28,35,36). Different tertiary interaction motifs with different
specificities can exhibit very similar interaction geometries
and therefore can be modularly swapped to redirect supra-
molecular assembly (28) (C. Geary, S. Baudrey, N. Leontis
and L. Jaeger manuscript in preparation). This property of
RNA is exploited in the present work to precisely control
the orientation of assembly between consecutive tectoRNA
units along and perpendicular to the axis of assembly. By
combining three or more distinct swappable interacting motifs,
programmable assembly of a population of tectoRNA mole-
cules, each differing in the positioning of specific loops and
receptors, can thus be achieved to produce even more complex
supra-molecular RNA architectures. The central role of
RNA in complex biological machineries such as the ribosome
(18–21), the DNA packaging motor of phage Phi29 (65) or
bacterial riboswitches (22) suggests that complex dynamical
functions can be engineered using RNA. Future work will
explore the possibilities of exploiting RNA to engineer
filaments with potential functions similar to those of modern
cytoskeletal proteins.
The central involvement of RNA in modern living organ-
isms suggests that it is not a fossil but a modern molecule with
unique intrinsic properties not fully substituted by DNA or
protein. In the future, RNA will likely play a major role in the
development of new responsive biomaterials with potential
applications in nanotechnology, biotechnology and medicine
(36,44,66–68).
