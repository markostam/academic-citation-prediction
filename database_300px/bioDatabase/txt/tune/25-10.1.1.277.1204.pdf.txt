10 ABSTRACT
dbPTM is a database that compiles information
on protein post-translational modifications (PTMs),
such as the catalytic sites, solvent accessibility of
amino acid residues, protein secondary and tertiary
15 structures, protein domains and protein variations.
The database includes all of the experimentally
validated PTM sites from Swiss-Prot, PhosphoELM
and O-GLYCBASE. Only a small fraction of Swiss-
Prot proteins are annotated with experimentally
20 verified PTM. Although the Swiss-Prot provides rich
information about the PTM, other structural proper-
ties and functional information of proteins are also
essential for elucidating protein mechanisms. The
dbPTM systematically identifies three major types
25 of protein PTM (phosphorylation, glycosylation
and sulfation) sites against Swiss-Prot proteins by
refining our previously developed prediction tool,
KinasePhos (http://kinasephos.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/).
Solvent accessibility and secondary structure of
30 residues are also computationally predicted and are
mapped to the PTM sites. The resource is now freely
available at http://dbPTM.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.
INTRODUCTION
Protein post-translational modification (PTM) is an extremely
35 important cellular control mechanism because it may alter
proteins’ physical and chemical properties, folding, confor-
mation, distribution, stability, activity and consequently, their
functions (1). Examples of the biological effects of protein
modifications include phosphorylation for signal transduction,
40attachment of fatty acids for membrane anchoring and
association, and glycosylation for changing protein half-life,
targeting substrates, and promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions. With the accelerating progress in proteomics,
biological knowledgebases containing a wealth of informa-
45tion, in particular protein modifications, are playing crucial
roles in cell regulation research (2).
The Swiss-Prot knowledge base (3) includes as much modi-
fication information as is available with consistency and struc-
ture, allowing easy retrieval by biologists. Phospho.ELM (1),
50which was developed as part of the ELM (Eukaryotic Linear
Motif) resource, is a new resource containing experimentally
verified phosphorylation sites that were manually curated from
the literature. O-GLYCBASE (4) is a database of glycopro-
teins, most of which include experimentally verified O-linked
55glycosylation sites. The RESID protein modification database
is a comprehensive collection of annotations and structures
for protein modifications and cross-links including pre-, co-
and post-translational modifications (5). The RESID database
provides modification information, literature citations, Gene
60Ontology (GO) cross-references, protein sequence database
feature table annotations, structure diagrams and molecular
models. Each RESID entry presents a protein with a chemic-
ally unique modification and indicates how the modification is
currently annotated in the Swiss-Prot (6).
65In this study, we collect the known PTM information from
external biological data sources. Since only a small fraction of
Swiss-Prot proteins are annotated with experimentally verified
PTMs, we also developed computational tools to comprehens-
ively identify phosphorylation sites, glycosylation sites and
70sulfation sites against the Swiss-Prot proteins. Protein struc-
tural properties and functional information, such as the solvent
accessibility of residues, protein variations, non-synonymous

single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), protein tertiary struc-
tures and protein functional domains, are provided for
researchers who are investigating the protein PTM mechan-
isms. Web query interface and graphical visualization were
5 designed and implemented to facilitate access to the database
content.
DATA GENERATION
The data generation flow of the dbPTM is briefly depicted in
Figure 1. The data generation flow comprises the three major
10 components: integration of external known PTM databases,
learning and prediction of PTM sites, and structural or func-
tional annotations. The experimentally validated PTM data
sources were extracted from Swiss-Prot (3), Phospho.ELM
(1) and O-GLYCBASE (4). The experimentally verified PTM
15 sites were used to generate computer models to further identify
putative PTM sites against the Swiss-Prot proteins. Additional
structural properties and functional information, such as pro-
tein tertiary structures, protein secondary structures, solvent
accessibility of residues, protein functional domains, protein
20variations and non-synonymous SNP, are also annotated to
the Swiss-Prot proteins. The detailed data generation flow is
described below.
Integration of external known PTM databases
Three external biological databases related to protein
25PTM information, Swiss-Prot (3), Phospho.ELM (1) and O-
GLYCBASE (4), are integrated into the proposed resource.
Both the experimentally validated PTM sites and the putative
PTM sites, which are annotated as ‘by similarity’, ‘potential’
or ‘probable’ in the ‘MOD_RES’ fields, have been extracted
30from the Swiss-Prot database (3). As summarized in Table 1,
release 46.0 of Swiss-Prot contributes 11 025 experimental
validated PTM sites within 4921 proteins, and 72 308 putative
PTM sites within 31 026 proteins. The Phospho.ELM entries
store information about substrate proteins with the exact
35positions of residues are known to be phosphorylated by
cellular kinases. A total of 1703 experimentally verified phos-
phorylation sites within 556 proteins were obtained from
Phospho.ELM version 2 (1). O-GLYCBASE (4) Version 6.00
provides 242 glycoproteins containing 2765 experimentally

verified O-linked, N-linked and C-linked glycosylation sites.
Moreover, 185 glycoproteins in O-GLYCBASE are corres-
ponded to Swiss-Prot proteins, which have 2353 experiment-
ally verified glycosylation sites.
5 Learning and prediction of PTM sites
To provide the PTM information of the PTM un-annotated
proteins available from Swiss-Prot, we integrated several
computational tools for identifying the PTMs of the Swiss-
Prot proteins. Our previous work, namely KinasePhos (7),
10 incorporated the profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to
identify kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with 87% pre-
diction accuracy (8), which was compared with several phos-
phorylation prediction tools, such as NetPhos (9), DISPHOS
(10) and rBPNN (11) (see Supplementary Table S1). Kinase-
15 Phos is integrated and used to fully detect the kinase-specific
phosphorylation sites against the Swiss-Prot proteins. To
reduce the number of false positive predictions by KinasePhos,
we set the predictive parameters as the values when the
prediction specificity is 100% (8).
20 As depicted in Supplementary Figure S1, the KinasePhos-
like method, which is similar to KinasePhos for phosphoryla-
tion sites, was designed and implemented to learn models for
the prediction of the sulfation sites, N-linked glycosylation
sites and C-linked glycosylation sites (Table 2). We used
25 the 144 known sulfation sites of tyrosine, 1790 N-linked glyc-
osylation sites of asparagine and 49 C-linked glycosyla-
tion sites of tryptophan to evaluate the performance of the
KinasePhos-like prediction tools. The result suggests that all
three KinasePhos-like tools exhibited high prediction pre-
30 cision, sensitivity and specificity (Supplementary Table S2).
Structural and functional annotations
In order to provide more effective information about protein
structural and functional annotations relevant to protein PTM,
a variety of biological databases, such as Swiss-Prot (12),
35 Ensembl (13), InterPro (14), PDB (15) and RESID (5), are
integrated.
Protein variation is the change of amino acids in poly-
peptides. As summarized in Table 1, Swiss-Prot contributes
32 101 protein variants corresponding to 6115 proteins,
40 where 47 variant residues are located at the PTM sites and
267 variant residues are located surrounding 236 PTM sites
(4  +4 AA). Furthermore, single amino acid polymorph-
ism (SAP) is the amino acid variation corresponding to the
genetic variation as the definition of non-synonymous SNP
45in genomic sequence. The amino acid variants may have an
impact on protein folding, active sites, or the overall solubility
and stability of a protein. SAP is the type of variation most
frequently related to human diseases (12). Therefore, when the
amino acid variations occur in the PTM sites or the surround-
50ing residues, they may affect the recognition of PTM sites by
catalytic kinases. A total of 23 378 human non-synonymous
SNPs located at 7230 Swiss-Prot human proteins were
obtained from the variation part of Ensembl database (13).
InterPro provides 1 113 928 entries corresponding to
55161 988 Swiss-Prot proteins. We found that about 65% of
Swiss-Prot annotated PTM sites are located at InterPro
annotated protein domains. The RESID (5) protein modifica-
tions database is integrated into dbPTM to provide PTM
related information, such as mass difference, chemical
60formula, enzymatic activities, literature citations, GO cross-
references, structure diagrams and molecular models.
The latest version of PDB contains 31 721 tertiary structures
corresponding to 6806 Swiss-Prot protein entries (Table 1).
For the proteins with known tertiary structures, the DSSP (16)
65program was used to extract the true secondary structure
and solvent accessibility for those 6808 Swiss-Prot proteins.
Solvent accessibility of amino acids residues is important for
both the structure and function of proteins, especially the
PTMs studied in this investigation. Protein secondary structure
70is the regular arrangement of amino acid residues in a segment
of a polypeptide chain, where each amino acid is assigned
a structure state, helix (H), strand (E) or coil (C). There are
1124 experimentally verified PTMs have the true secondary
structure and solvent accessibility.
75However, only 4% of Swiss-Prot proteins have the
known tertiary structures. For proteins without known tertiary
structures, two previously published tools, RVP-net (17) and
PSIPRED (18), were applied to predict the solvent accessib-
ility and the secondary structure, respectively (see Table 2).
80RVP-net (17) presents a feed-forward type neural network
which can predict a real value ranging from 0 to 100% of
accessible surface areas (ASAs) for amino acid residues,
based on their neighborhood information. We applied the
RVP-net program (17) to fully predict the real-valued ASA
85for the amino acid residues of all Swiss-Prot proteins. By
selecting a suggested threshold (17) (i.e. 25%), the residues
with larger ASA values are viewed as surface residues.
DATA STATISTICS
The statistics of the experimentally verified PTMs and the
90putative PTMs compiled in the dbPTM resource are shown
in the Table 3. For instance, dbPTM contains 14 057 known
PTM sites and 772 154 putative PTM sites. The parameters of
the predictive tools, KinasePhos, KinasePhos-like Sulfation
and KinasePhos-like Glycosylation—for the prediction of
95phosphorylation sites, sulfation sites and glycosylation sites,
respectively—are set as the values when the predictive spe-
cificity is set to 100% during the parameter optimization of
the trained models (8). The numbers of putative phosphoryla-
tion and sulfation sites, where the ASA of the substrates are
100>25% (defined as the residue locating at the protein surface),
are 652 756 and 13 315, respectively. There are a total of
33 887 predicted N-linked glycosylations of asparagine and
C-linked glycosylations of tryptophan.

INTERFACE
To facilitate the use of the dbPTM resource, we developed a
website for users to browse and search for content. As depicted
in Supplementary Figure S2, the user can select a particular
5 type of PTM for browsing the information. When clicking on
a PTM entry, it pops up a window showing the solvent
accessibility of the residues, the secondary structures and
the flanking sequence of the PTM site.
The search pages allow users to query the database using the
10 Swiss-Prot ID and protein name. The interface also presents
structural properties and functional information corresponding
to the resulting proteins, such as the solvent accessibility of
residues, non-synonymous variations, protein domains and
protein secondary structures. Furthermore, the positional
15 relationships among the PTMs, protein structural properties
and protein functional information are graphically displayed
(Figure 2).
Generally, a 3D presentation is an effective manner for
revealing the PTM information corresponding to the protein
20 tertiary structures. For these purposes, we developed a protein
structure viewer for the visualization of protein tertiary struc-
tures and especially of the port-translational modification resi-
dues. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, the visualization
tool provides a comprehensive view of the whole protein
25 structure and marks residues that are annotated as the PTM
sites. This visualization tool is implemented as a client-side
tool based on OpenGL’s pipeline.
The visualization of the protein structures and the annotated
residues are provided by two different ways according to
30different users’ platforms. For users in MS Windows, the
users can download the installable package of the Silver.
After the Silver is installed, the protein tertiary structures
and the PTM sites can be graphically and directly provided,
as shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Alternatively, for users
35in other platforms such as Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris, the
user can download the PDB structure and the Rasmol (http://
www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/) scripts for the labeling of
the PTM sites.
CONCLUSIONS
40The proposed resource not only integrates the experimentally
validated PTM information, but it also computationally annot-
ates the Swiss-Prot proteins for putative phosphoryla-
tion, glycosylation and sulfation sites. Furthermore, the
PTM related protein structural properties and functional
45information, such as solvent accessibility of amino acid resi-
dues, protein variations, protein secondary structures, protein
tertiary structures and protein domains, are provided to facil-
itate the research of protein PTMs.

One of the prospective goals for dbPTM is to integrate more
efficient prediction tools for other types of PTM in addition to
phosphorylation, sulfation and N- and C-linked glycosylation.
Other protein sequence databases besides the Swiss-Prot
5 protein database can also be considered and annotated for
post-translation modifications by the proposed resource.
