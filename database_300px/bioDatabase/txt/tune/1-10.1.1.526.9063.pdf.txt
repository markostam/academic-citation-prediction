ABSTRACT
Proper maintenance of the genome is of great
importance. Consequently, damaged nucleotides
are repaired through redundant pathways. We con-
sidered whether the genome is protected from form-
amidopyrimidine nucleosides (Fapy*dA, Fapy*dG)
via a pathway distinct from the Escherichia coli
guanine oxidation system. The formamidopyri-
midines are produced in significant quantities in
DNA as a result of oxidative stress and are efficiently
excised by formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase.
Previous reports suggest that the formam-
idopyrimidine nucleosides are substrates for endo-
nucleases III and VIII, enzymes that are typically
associated with pyrimidine lesion repair in E.coli.
We investigated the possibility that Endo III and/or
Endo VIII play a role in formamidopyrimidine nucle-
oside repair by examining Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG
excision opposite all four native 20-deoxyribonuc-
leotides. Endo VIII excises both lesions more effi-
ciently than does Endo III, but the enzymes exhibit
similar selectivity with respect to their action on
duplexes containing the formamidopyrimidines
opposite native deoxyribonucleotides. Fapy*dA is
removed more rapidly than Fapy*dG, and duplexes
containing purine nucleotides opposite the lesions
are superior substrates compared with those contain-
ing formamidopyrimidine–pyrimidine base pairs.
This dependence upon opposing nucleotide indic-
ates that Endo III and Endo VIII do not serve as back
up enzymes to formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosy-
lase in the repair of formamidopyrimidines. When
considered in conjunction with cellular studies
[J. O. Blaisdell, Z. Hatahet and S. S. Wallace (1999)
J. Bacteriol., 181, 6396–6402], these results also sug-
gest that Endo III and Endo VIII do not protect E.coli
againstpossiblemutationsattributable to formamido-
pyrimidine lesions.
INTRODUCTION
Proper repair of damaged DNA is critical to maintaining
the integrity of the genome. Cells have developed multiple
approaches for repairing DNA damage and there is increasing
evidence for overlap between these repair systems (1). For
instance, nucleotide incision repair complements base excision
repair (BER) for some lesions (2,3). Effective DNA repair
requires the enzyme to discriminate among substrates based
upon opposing nucleotide. Excision of a lesion within a pro-
mutagenic base pair leaves only the incorrect nucleotide to
direct native nucleotide incorporation and will result in a
mutation. We examined the feasibility that BER enzymes
found in Escherichia coli back up and/or augment the repair
of the formamidopyrimidine family of lesions. The formam-
idopyrimidine nucleosides (Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG) (Figure 1)
are formed in DNA as a result of oxidative stress. Compared
with other DNA lesions, they often are produced in high yields,
especially under O2-deficient conditions (4–7). The lesions are
a substrate for a BER enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA
glycosylase, Fpg) typically associated with modified purine
repair in E.coli (8,9). Recent reports describe the excision of
modified purine nucleotides by Endo III and Endo VIII from
randomly damaged DNA, as well as from oligonucleotides
containing MeFapy*dG or OxodG (Figure 1) (10–14). These
studies led us to investigate Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG excision
by Endo III and Endo VIII as a function of opposing nucleotide
in order to determine whether these enzymes protect E.coli
against the formamidopyrimidines.

The formamidopyrimidine nucleosides are structurally
unique. Facile isomerization of the monomeric lesions between
a- and b-nucleotides is a distinctive formamidopyrimidine
nucleoside property (15,16). However, a recently reported bio-
chemical study suggests that the b-configurations of Fapy*dA
and Fapy*dG predominate in duplex DNA (17). Although they
are derived from purines, as their name implies they are amino
pyrimidines (homopyrimidines). The suggested relationship to
pyrimidine lesions is consistent with reports that MeFapy*dG
(Figure 1) oligonucleotides and DNA substrates containing
randomly produced formamidopyrimidines are repaired by
Endo III and Endo VIII, BER enzymes that typically excise
pyrimidine lesions in E.coli (12–14). Both enzymes preferen-
tially excise MeFapy*dG when it is opposite purine nucle-
otides. However, enzymes typically associated with the repair
of damaged purines also recognize the formamidopyrimidine
nucleosides (8,12–15,18–26). These experiments revealed that
the guanine oxidation (GO) family enzymes Fpg and MutY
efficiently repair Fapy*dG:dC and Fapy*dG:dA base pairs,
respectively, which protects against G!T transversions (9).
This protection against the promutagenic FapydG:dA base pair
is consistent with in vitro replication experiments, which
showed that dA is misincorporated opposite the lesion (27).
Despite their readily apparent structural differences,
the formamidopyrimidines and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydropurines
(OxodA, OxodG, Figure 1) are believed to arise from a com-
mon intermediate (28). The connection between these families
of DNA lesions is reflected in their biochemistry, thermo-
dynamic preferences for base pairing, and penchant for those
derived from 20-deoxyguanosine (Fapy*dG and OxodG) to
instruct polymerases to misincorporate dA opposite them-
selves (18,25,27,29–31). Although there are many similarities
in the recognition of formamidopyrimidine and 8-oxopurine
lesions, their repair by all BER enzymes has not been studied
equally. For example, MeFapy*dG excision by Endo VIII and
Endo III is well characterized (14). In contrast, OxodG
excision by Endo III has not been reported, and there are
conflicting reports concerning the action of Endo VIII on
this lesion. One group found that Endo VIII excised OxodG
slightly more efficiently when the lesion was opposite a purine
compared with 20-deoxycytidine (11). This opposing base
preference for OxodG excision by Endo VIII gave rise to
the hypothesis that it might be the fourth member of the
GO family of BER enzymes that guard against GO (11). Its
proposed role is to repair OxodG:dA mispairs that arise from
misincorporation of OxodGTP. Thus, one would expect large
increases in T!G transversions owing to OxodG incorpora-
tion in nth nei deficient E.coli. However, increases in these
mutations are not observed in nth nei mutants, suggesting that
Endo III and Endo VIII do not play such a role in protect-
ing E.coli against this lesion (10). In accordance with this,
Blaisdell et al. (10) reported preferential excision of OxodG
when it was opposite dC and suggested that Endo VIII is a
back up repair system for Fpg. Additional information is avail-
able regarding the excision of modified purines by Endo III
and Endo VIII from studies on DNA substrates containing
randomly distributed lesions (12,13). In these experiments,
Fapy*dA excision from randomly damaged DNA is detected,
whereas Fapy*dG, OxodA and OxodG are not, despite their
formation under the oxidation conditions. Studies on randomly
damaged DNA provide a picture of the competition by various
lesions for BER enzymes. However, these experiments do not
allow one to discern if the enzyme is able to discriminate with
respect to opposing nucleotide. An important consequence
of this is that such experiments do not provide insight into
the enzyme’s ability to prevent mutations. Recently, chem-
ical syntheses of oligonucleotides containing Fapy*dA or
Fapy*dG were reported (22,23,32). We have taken advantage
of these substrates to examine formamidopyrimidine excision
by Endo III and Endo VIII when the lesions are opposite each
of the four native nucleotides. Consequently, we are able to
evaluate the possible roles of these enzymes in protecting
E.coli’s genome against the formamidopyrimidine lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General methods
Oligonucleotides were prepared on an Applied Biosystems
Inc. 394 DNA synthesizer. Commercially available DNA
synthesis reagents were obtained from Glen Research Inc
(Sterling, VA). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing
Fapy*dG or Fapy*dA were prepared as described previously
(22,23,32). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing Tg or 5,6-
dihydro-20-deoxyuridine (dHU) were prepared using com-
mercially available reagents and protocols provided by the
manufacturer (Glen Research). All others were synthesized
using standard protocols. DNA manipulations were carried
out using standard procedures (33). T4 polynucleotide kinase
was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).
Radionuclides were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia
(Piscataway, NJ). Plasmids containing the nth or nei genes
were obtained from Professors Kow and Hazra, respectively.
Hexa-his tagged Endo III was isolated using the Novagen
bugbuster kit and purified using a His*Bind column (Novagen,
Madison, WI). Endo VIII was isolated as described previously
(13). 50-32P-labeled duplexes were prepared by hybridizing

unlabeled complementary strand to that containing the lesion
(200–300 nm) for 5 min at 55C for Fapy*dA or 90C for
Fapy*dG, followed by slow cooling to room temperature (8,9).
Active site titration of Endo III and Endo VIII (34)
NaCNBH3 (50 mM) was added to 3 (30–100 nM) in 1·
Endo III buffer (10 mM HEPES–KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl,
and 10 mM EDTA). Endo III (81.5 mM as established by
Bradford assay) in 1· Endo III buffer was added to the
DNA solution (total volume: 10 ml) and incubated at 37C
for 30 min. The reactions were quenched with 10 ml of 2·
SDS–PAGE loading buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS
and 20% glycerol) and denatured (90C for 1 min and cooled
to 0C) before being separated by 12.5% SDS–PAGE. The
active site concentration was calculated as a percentage of
the total protein concentration (12.75%) and represents the
average of three experiments.
The active site concentration of Endo VIII (9.5% of the total
protein concentration) was determined in a similar manner
using 11.5 mM Endo VIII (as established by the Bradford
assay) and 3 (20–100 nM) in 1· Endo VIII buffer (20 mM
Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT and
0.1 mg/ml BSA).
Kinetics for excision of Tg (4) and Fapy*dA (1a)
opposite dA by Endo III
Reaction mixtures containing varying concentrations of DNA
(0.5–150 nM for 4 and 100–1300 nM for 1a) were prepared by
mixing the corresponding 2· DNA solution (5 ml) with a 2·
enzyme solution (5 ml) containing Endo III (0.5 nM for 4 and
10 nM for 1a) in 20 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl
and 20 mM EDTA. Reactions were run for 5 min at 37C and
then quenched with 95% formamide loading buffer (20 ml).
Samples were then denatured for 1 min at 90C, cooled on
ice and separated by 20% denaturing PAGE. To account for
the adventitious deglycosylation of Fapy*dA, a control was
carried out where the substrate (20 nM) was treated with 1 M
NaOH for 20 min at 37C. Samples were neutralized with 1 M
HCl, diluted with formamide loading buffer (20 ml) and dena-
tured for 1 min at 90C. The fraction of cleaved duplex (<7%)
in the control was subtracted from that in the reactions. Kinetic
parameters reported represent the results of three separate
experiments each carried out in triplicate.
Excision of Fapy*dG/Fapy*dA by Endo III and
Endo VIII as a function of opposing nucleotide
An enzyme–substrate solution containing Endo III (10 nM) in
1· Endo III buffer, or Endo VIII (0.1 nM for 1a–d; 1 nM for
2a–d) in 1· Endo VIII buffer and radiolabeled DNA (50 nM)
was incubated at 37C (5 ml total volume). After 20 min, the
reaction was quenched with 5 ml of 95% formamide loading
buffer. Samples were denatured for 1 min at 90C and sep-
arated by 20% denaturing PAGE. Reactions were carried out
in triplicate. Adventitious deglycosylation of Fapy*dA
(<7%)/dG (<3%) was accounted for as described above.
Single turnover kinetics of Fapy*dG opposite dA and dC
(2a, 2b) by Endo VIII (35)
An enzyme–substrate solution containing Endo VIII (20 nM)
in 1· Endo VIII buffer, and radiolabeled DNA (5 nM) was
incubated at 37C. Aliquots (10 ml) were taken after 0.5, 1, 3,
5, 15 and 30 min and quenched with 20 ml formamide loading
buffer. Background cleavage was accounted for as described
previously. Samples were denatured for 1 min at 90C and
separated by 20% denaturing PAGE. The data were plotted as
product concentration versus time and fit to Equation 1 to find
kobs. A0 is the amplitude of the exponential curve.

Kinetics for Fapy*dA (1a, 1c) and Fapy*dG (2a, 2d)
excision by Endo VIII
Reaction mixtures containing varying concentrations of
1a (0.5–10 nM), 1c (0.5–10 nM), 2a (25–400 nM) or 2d
(0.5–2 mM) were prepared by mixing a solution (5 ml)
containing the appropriate duplex with a 2· enzyme solution
(5 ml) containing Endo VIII (0.1 nM for 1a, 1c or 20 nM for 2a,
2d) in 2· Endo VIII buffer. After incubation at 37C for the
appropriate time (1a, 0.5 min; 1c, 1 min; 2a, 1 min; 2d, 15 min),
the reaction was quenched with formamide loading buffer
(10 ml). Samples were denatured for 1 min at 90C, cooled
on ice and then separated by 20% denaturing PAGE. Back-
ground cleavage was accounted for as described above.
Kinetic parameters reported represent the results of three
separate experiments carried out in triplicate.
Time course for excision of Fapy*dA (1a,c) by Endo VIII
An enzyme–substrate solution containing Endo VIII (1 nM)
in 1· Endo VIII buffer, and radiolabeled DNA (50 nM) was
incubated at 37C. Aliquots (5 ml) were taken over the course
of 20 min and quenched with formamide loading buffer (5 ml).
Background cleavage was accounted for as described above.
Samples were denatured for 1 min at 90C and separated
by 20% denaturing PAGE. Reactions were carried out in trip-
licate.

RESULTS
Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG excision by Endo VIII
Steady-state kinetic analysis for Fapy*dA excision was carried
out when the lesion was opposite the 2 nt [dA (1a) and dT (1c)]
most frequently incorporated opposite it by Klenow exo, and
which form the most stable duplexes (Table 2) (25). Multiple
turnovers were observed in a relatively short time for both
substrates (Figure 2). The kinetic constants measured for Endo
VIII excision of Fapy*dA indicate that the lesion is excised
about twice as efficiently when it is opposite dA than dT. This
is attributable to a greater kcat for reaction with 1a. The meas-
ured kcat for the excision of Fapy*dA opposite the correct
nucleotide (1a) is much larger than that observed for dHU
(3) and accounts for most of the 50-fold greater specificity
constant. The excision of dHU proceeds with a specificity
constant (kcat/Km), comparable with that reported previously,
verifying its accuracy (11).
Quantitative analysis of Fapy*dG excision opposite dA
reveals that repair of this lesion is 500 times less efficient
than repair of Fapy*dA by Endo VIII (Table 2). When
comparing formamidopyrimidine substrates containing dA
opposite the respective lesions, the predominant difference
in kinetic parameters is owing to a significantly higher Km
(>70-fold) for the duplex containing Fapy*dG. Steady-state
experiments on Fapy*dG:dC (2d) excision verified that
this substrate is considerably poorer than that containing a
Fapy*dG:dA base pair. We were unable to saturate the enzyme
even when using as much as 2 mM Fapy*dG:dC containing
DNA (2d). Hence, the Km expressed is a lower limit (Table 2).
These experiments were discontinued due to the biological
irrelevance of such an unfavorable process. The excision of
Fapy*dG opposite dC (2d) was so low that the enzyme did not
turnover during the course of the reaction (data not shown),
although multiple turnovers were observed for 2a in <5 min. In
order to eliminate selective product inhibition following
excision of Fapy*dG opposite dC, single turnover experiments
(excess Endo VIII) were carried out (Figure 3) (35). These data
were consistent with those obtained under multiple turnover
conditions. There is a burst of Fapy*dG excision when

opposite dA. More than 65% of the lesion is removed within 5
min (kobs = 0.5 min1), and 80% after 30 min. In contrast, a
burst is not observed when Fapy*dG is opposite dC, and <30%
of the lesion is excised in 30 min. An upper limit for kobs was
estimated by fitting the product concentration versus time
to a first order process. This provided an upper limit
for kobs = 0.02 min1, confirming that Fapy*dG:dA is a
superior substrate for Endo VIII.
Although kinetic parameters for Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG
excision opposite each of the four native nucleotides under
Michaelis–Menten conditions were not determined, the
amount of strand scission by Endo VIII was measured as a
function of opposing nucleotide at constant DNA and enzyme
concentration (Figures 4 and 5). The substrates were present
in excess in all experiments. A proportionally smaller amount
of enzyme, indicative of its more efficient excision, was
employed for cleavage of Fapy*dA containing DNA
(Figure 4). Excision of Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG (Figure 5)
showed similar trends with respect to opposing nucleotide.
Repair was more efficient when a purine was opposite the
respective lesion. Furthermore, the rank order for repair as
a function of opposing nucleotide was dG > dA > dT > dC
when the lesion was either Fapy*dA (Figure 4) or Fapy*dG
(Figure 5).
Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG excision by Endo III
Many of the trends noted above for formamidopyrimidine
excision by Endo VIII were observed with Endo III. Fapy*dA
excision opposite thymidine (1c) was examined under
Michaelis–Menten conditions, but saturation could not be
achieved giving a Km > 1 mM (data not shown). This is much
higher than the Km for Fapy*dA repair by Fpg and quantitative
analysis was not pursued further (8). Excision of Fapy*dA
opposite dA (1a) was much more efficient (Figure 6). The
kinetic parameters for repair of the Fapy*dA:dA duplex by
Endo III (kcat/Km = 6.9 – 1.0 · 102 nM1 min1) describe
a process that is comparable in efficiency with excision
of thymidine glycol opposite dA (4, kcat/Km = 6.0 – 1.9 ·
102 nM1 min1). The latter value is comparable with
that reported in a different sequence context (36). However,
excision of Fapy*dA by Endo III is >200 times less efficient
than by Endo VIII (Table 1). The Km for Endo III excision
of Fapy*dA opposite dA (144.8 – 34.2 nM) is 60-fold
higher than repair by Endo VIII. A significantly lower
kcat (7.9 – 2.1 min1) also contributes to the differences in
specificity constants.
One of the trends shared between Endo III and Endo VIII is
the more efficient excision of Fapy*dA than Fapy*dG. The
data presented above reveal that Fapy*dA repair by Endo III is
much less efficient than excision by Endo VIII. Initial experi-
ments indicated that Fapy*dG repair by Endo III is signific-
antly less efficient than that of Fapy*dA and could not
compete with the excision kinetics exhibited by Fpg or
Endo VIII (above) (9). Consequently, the dependency of
Fapy*dG excision by Endo III on opposing nucleotide was
investigated at constant DNA and enzyme concentration for a
fixed time (Figure 7). Duplexes containing purines opposite
Fapy*dG (2a, b) were cleaved more extensively than those
containing Fapy*dG:Pyr base pairs (2c, d), which are very
poor substrates. Preferential excision of Fapy*dA by Endo
III was also observed when the lesion was paired with a purine
(Figure 8). One minor difference is that the rank order of

Fapy*dA excision by Endo III was dG > dA > dC > dT, and
not dG > dA > dT > dC as was observed for Fapy*dG repair
by the same enzyme and removal of either lesion by Endo VIII.
DISCUSSION
The discovery of alternative repair pathways for DNA lesions,
such as nucleotide incision repair, suggests that organisms
have developed redundancy in systems designed to protect
their genomes (2,3). Although Endo III and Endo VIII are
typically associated with modified pyrimidine repair in
E.coli, examination of DNA containing random distributions
of DNA lesions revealed that these enzymes also excise
Fapy*dA (12,13). Here, the excision of Fapy*dA and
Fapy*dG by Endo III and Endo VIII was examined as a func-
tion of opposing native nucleotide by taking advantage of
chemically synthesized oligonucleotides containing the
lesions at defined sites. We were motivated to determine
whether Endo III and/or Endo VIII play a role in repairing
formamidopyrimidines in E.coli.
Overall, the reactivity trends observed using synthetic
oligonucleotide duplexes containing a single formam-
idopyrimidine nucleoside were consistent with experiments
using substrates containing a random distribution of lesions
(12,13). Steady-state analyses and single time point experi-
ments indicate that Endo III and Endo VIII excise Fapy*dA
more efficiently than Fapy*dG. When the lesions were oppos-
ite dA, Fapy*dA was excised by Endo VIII >500 times more
efficiently than Fapy*dG (Table 2). The more facile hydrolysis
of Fapy*dA lesions was evident in single time point experi-
ments using Endo VIII, in which 10-fold less enzyme was
needed to excise Fapy*dA than Fapy*dG (Figures 3 and 4).
The reason for the more efficient cleavage of Fapy*dA than
Fapy*dG is uncertain and could be attributable to multiple
issues, including the higher lability of its N-glycosidic bond
(15). In addition to correctly predicting the relative reactivity
of Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG in homogeneous substrates, Dizdar-
oglu’s experiments revealed Endo VIII’s greater effectiveness
at excising the lesions than that of Endo III (12,13). However,
the studies described here using purified DNA substrates con-
taining a single lesion revealed a much larger difference
between the two enzymes. This was evident in steady-state
analyses of reactions with DNA containing a Fapy*dA:dA
base pair (1a) where Endo VIII was >800 times more efficient
than Endo III and from experiments where significantly less
Endo VIII could cleave comparable amounts of substrates
(Figures 4, 5, 7 and 8). Furthermore, the absolute values for
kcat/Km of Fapy*dA opposite dA (where a direct comparison
could be made) by Endo III and Endo VIII were significantly
greater than when the lesion was present in a milieu of DNA
damage products (12,13). This could be attributable to the
presence of lesions that compete with one another for the
BER enzymes in such experiments.
In order for a BER enzyme to protect the genome, it must
discriminate against excising DNA lesions when they are part
of promutagenic base pairs (e.g. Fapy*dG:dA) that result from
unfaithful replication. For instance, Fpg excises OxodG and
Fapy*dG 20 times more efficiently when they are opposite
dC than dA (9,30). However, it is interesting to note that
OxodG is excised from duplexes in which it is opposite dG
or dT even more rapidly. Neither of these nucleotides are
reported to be incorporated efficiently opposite OxodG by
E.coli polymerases in vitro or in vivo (29,37–39). Hence,
the biological relevance of BER enzyme specificity should
be interpreted in the context of replication experiments.
Consequently, we examined each enzyme’s excision of the
formamidopyrimidine nucleosides opposite their correct nuc-
leotide (e.g. Fapy*dA:dT), as well as from duplexes in which
the lesions are opposite dA. In vitro experiments indicate that
dA is the nucleotide most likely to be misincorporated oppos-
ite the formamidopyrimidines (25,27). Both lesions were
excised less efficiently when paired with their respective nat-
ive nucleotide’s match than when opposite dA. This indicates
that it is unlikely that either Endo III or Endo VIII serves as a
back up for formamidopyrimidine nucleoside repair by Fpg in
E.coli. In order to fulfill such a role, the enzymes would have
to preferentially excise the lesions when they are opposite the
‘correct’ nucleotide (e.g. dC opposite Fapy*dG).
One possible explanation for the preference for Endo VIII
and Endo III excision of Fapy*dA and Fapy*dG when the
lesions are mispaired with dA is that the enzymes protect
against formamidopyrimidine incorporation in the nascent
strand. This has been proposed for Endo VIII repair of
OxodG, resulting in its consideration as the fourth enzyme
for protecting the E.coli genome against GO (11). This pro-
posal has not been unanimously embraced (10). For instance,
other researchers found that OxodG was excised opposite dC
more rapidly than when opposed by dA (10). In addition, in
contrast to OxodGTP, it is not known whether the nucleotide
triphosphates of the formamidopyrimidines are incorporated
opposite dA by polymerases (40). Before one can propose that
the BER enzymes guard against formamidopyrimidine incorp-
oration in the nascent strand, one must be sure that the lesions
are indeed substrates for this process. Moreover, protecting
E.coli against formamidopyrimidine lesion incorporation in
the nascent strand is an unlikely role for Endo III or Endo
VIII, because of the lack of an increase in the corresponding
mutations (e.g. T!A from Fapy*dA, T!G from Fapy*dG)
in nth nei deficient cells (10).
Alternatively, one can rationalize formamidopyrimidine
excision by Endo III and Endo VIII based upon the enzymes’
proclivity to repair damaged pyrimidines, and the structural
similarity between the families of lesions. The dependence
of repair by these enzymes upon opposing nucleotide is
quite similar for the formamidopyrimidines and damaged
pyrimidines (36). The comprehensive comparison of for-
mamidopyrimidine repair dependency on opposing nucleotide
consistently showed that Endo III and Endo VIII distinguish
between purines and pyrimidines (Figures 4, 5, 7 and 8).
However, the enzymes did not significantly distinguish one
purine from another, or between individual pyrimidines. Fur-
thermore, formamidopyrimidine repair efficiency by Endo III

and Endo VIII rivals that of pyrimidine lesions. Fapy*dA
repair is as efficient as thymidine glycol excision by Endo
III (36). Fapy*dA is repaired by Endo VIII more efficiently
than is dHU, and Fapy*dG is excised 6-fold less efficiently
than the pyrimidine lesion (11). The structural relationship
between the two families of DNA lesions stems from cleavage
of the purine’s imidazole ring en route to formamidopyrimi-
dine formation. This produces a pyrimidine ring linked to the
anomeric position of the 20-deoxyribose via a nitrogen atom. In
the parlance of organic chemistry, the formamidopyrimidine
lesions are ‘homopyrimidines’. Hence, we propose that Endo
III and Endo VIII excise formamidopyrimidine lesions
because they are recognized as modified pyrimidines. Because
pyrimidines are typically paired with purines, this also
explains why Endo III and Endo VIII preferentially recognize
Fapy*dA:Pur and Fapy*dG:Pur base pairs.
CONCLUSIONS
Endo III and Endo VIII excise Fapy*dG and Fapy*dA
efficiently compared with dihydropyrimidine lesions. The
formamidopyrimidines are excised more efficiently opposite
purines than pyrimidines. This could be an indication that
these enzymes are involved in the removal of these lesions
from the nascent strands of DNA, but related studies in E.coli
do not support this concept (10). The selectivity exhibited by
Endo III and Endo VIII with respect to opposing nucleotide
also does not support a role for either enzyme as a back up to
Fpg repair of the formamidopyrimidine nucleosides in E.coli.
Instead, the data indicate that these enzymes recognize
formamidopyrimidines owing to their structural similarity
to damaged pyrimidines. These experiments highlight the
importance of examining the dependence of DNA lesion repair
on opposing nucleotide identity.
