ABSTRACT
Gene silencing by targeted DNA methylation has
potential applications in basic research and ther-
apy. To establish targeted methylation in human cell
lines, the catalytic domains (CDs) of mouse Dnmt3a
and Dnmt3b DNA methyltransferases (MTases) were
fused to different DNA binding domains (DBD)
of GAL4 and an engineered Cys2His2 zinc finger
domain. We demonstrated that (i) Dense DNA
methylation can be targeted to specific regions in
gene promoters using chimeric DNA MTases. (ii)
Site-specific methylation leads to repression of
genes controlled by various cellular or viral promo-
ters. (iii) Mutations affecting any of the DBD, MTase
or target DNA sequences reduce targeted methyla-
tion and gene silencing. (iv) Targeted DNA methyla-
tion is effective in repressing Herpes Simplex Virus
type 1 (HSV-1) infection in cell culture with the viral
titer reduced by at least 18-fold in the presence of
an MTase fused to an engineered zinc finger
DBD, which binds a single site in the promoter of
HSV-1 gene IE175k. In short, we show here that
it is possible to direct DNA MTase activity to
predetermined sites in DNA, achieve targeted gene
silencing in mammalian cell lines and interfere with
HSV-1 propagation.
INTRODUCTION
Methylation of cytosine residues at CG dinucleotide sites
in DNA is an important epigenetic modification (1–4) that,
in general, leads to gene silencing (5–8). Aberrant changes
in DNA methylation often contribute to tumorigenesis (9,10)
and etiology of other diseases (11). Gene repression by DNA
methylation is mediated by methyl-cytosine binding proteins
assembled on methylated CGs (3). These proteins recruit cor-
epressors like mSin3 or Mi2-NuRD and histone deacetylase
and trigger the formation of condensed, repressive chromatin,
which leads to stable inactivation of gene expression (12).
Another repressive mechanism of DNA methylation is to
interfere with the DNA binding of transcription factors
(13,14).
DNA methylation is established by de novo DNA methyl-
transferases (MTases), Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, during early
embryogenesis and later maintained by Dnmt1 (2,6,15).
The C-terminal catalytic domains (CDs) of Dnmt3a and 3b
are active in the absence of their N-terminal part (16,17).
They can be fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain
(DBD) in order to target methylation activity to a predeter-
mined DNA sequence (18–20). Targeted DNA methylation
was observed in vitro using a fusion protein consisting of
the DBD of Zif268 and the prokaryotic CG methytransferase
M.SssI (18). In addition, in yeast cells, Carvin et al. demon-
strated targeted methylation, after fusing the transcriptional
factor PHO5 to the viral M.CviPI MTase as well as fusing
the DBDs of zinc-finger proteins based on Zif268 with
M.CviPI and M.SssI (19,21). Targeted methylation also has
been observed using the bacterial Dam adenine-N6 MTase
and it has been applied to map the DNA binding sites of
transcription factors (20). However, so far gene silencing
by targeted methylation has not been demonstrated.
In this study, we fused DBDs of transcription factors or
engineered zinc-finger proteins to the CDs of either the
Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b DNA MTases in order to achieve targeted
DNA methylation and selective silencing of gene expression.
These fusion proteins were directed to the specific target sites
by the DBDs, such that DNA methylation only occurs in the
vicinity of these target sites. We here report targeted DNA
methylation as well as efficient gene silencing in three differ-
ent reporter systems with presumably very different natural

gene regulatory elements. This includes the TK (Human
herpesvirus 1 thymidylate kinase) promoter with added bind-
ing sequence for GAL4 (UAS), the human c-Ha-ras gene
promoter with added UAS and the immediate early IE175k
promoter of the Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1). We
also show that methylation-mediated gene silencing is effec-
tive in repressing infection with a wild type HSV-1. This
opens possibilities of using this strategy as an anti-viral
treatment against other, more serious human pathogens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vectors construction
Construction of reporter genes. Minimal TK promoter
(158 bp) containing five repeats of the GAL4 binding
sequence (UAS) upstream of the promoter (22) was amplified
by PCR and cloned into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter gene
vector (Promega) to obtain pGL-5·UAS-Luc. TK promoter
alone was also inserted into pGL3-basic as a non-targeted
reporter gene control, named pGL-TK-Luc. Both promoter-
reporter fusions were subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1-
neo as BglII–NotI fragments to construct 5·UAS-TK-Luc
and TK-Luc that were used in all the co-transfection experi-
ments. In addition, pcDNA-UAS-luciferase containing one
UAS upstream of the TK was constructed (UAS-TK-Luc).
Human c-Ha-ras promoter (GenBank entry number:
M13221.1) was amplified from HEK293T genomic DNA,
and cloned into MluI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic. A
single GAL4 binding sequence (1·UAS) was introduced
upstream of the promoter to generate UAS-ras-Luc. The
entire IE175k promoter region (positions from 380 to
+30) (23) of HSV-1 was amplified from the plasmid pPO13
(gifted by P. O’Hare), and cloned into pGL3-basic to obtain
IE175-Luc. The binding site for B1 and 6F6 zinc-finger
proteins (50-GATCGGGCGGTAATGAGAT-30) was deleted
from IE175k promoter by PCR-based mutagenesis to gener-
ate IE175mut-Luc.
Construction of targeting methyltransferases. The GAL4
DNA binding domain (GBD, 1–147 amino acid of P04386)
containing a 30 amino acid linker including a myc-tag
was amplified by PCR from pGBKT7 (BD Biosciences)
and equipped with a nuclear localization signal (PKKKKRK)
at the C-terminus of GBD. The GBD was cloned into
pcDNA3.1-neo (Invitrogen), to generate pcDNA-GBD.
The CD of Dnmt3a (CD-Dnmt3a, 598–908 amino acid of
o88508) and Dnmt3b (CD-Dnmt3b, 557–859 amino acid of
NP_001003961) were cloned into pcDNA-GBD in frame
with GBD to generate GBD-3a and GBD-3b. Specific muta-
tions were introduced into the active site ENV motif of
CD-Dnmt3a and CD-Dnmt3b, by changing the ENV sequence
to ANV, and into coenzyme binding motif II (E74A) of
CD-Dnmt3a. (The ENV to ANV mutation corresponds to
E752A in full-length Dnmt3a and E703A in full-length
Dnmt3b. The CD-Dnmt3a-E74A mutation corresponds to
E660A in full-length Dnmt3a.) The CD-Dnmt3a-ENV, CD-
Dnmt3b-ENV and CD-Dnmt3a-E74A variants were shown
to be catalytically inactive (17,24). Also, two point mutations
(L32P and C38G) were introduced to GAL4 domain to
create mutGBD-3a and mutGBD-3b. These mutations were
previously demonstrated to abolish the binding of GAL4 to
its target sequence completely (25,26). DNA fragments cod-
ing for zinc-finger proteins 6F6 (containing six zinc fingers
and binding to 272 to 253 of HSV-1 IE175k promoter)
and B1 (containing three zinc fingers and binding to 262
to 253 of HSV-1 IE175k promoter) (23) were amplified
by high-fidelity PCR and cloned into pcDNA4-myc-His-A
(Invitrogen) at HindIII and BamHI sites. The CDs of Dnmt3a,
Dnmt3b and their mutants (described above) were cloned at
BamHI and XbaI sites in frame with the zinc-finger domains
and the C-terminal myc-His tag. However, no expression of
the 6F6 and B1 fusion proteins containing Dnmt3b CD was
detectable. Therefore, for further experiments with 6F6 and
B1 only the Dnmt3a CD fusions were used. The plasmid
RG50 containing the HSV-1 VP16 gene under the control
of a CMV promoter, used for IE175k promoter activation
studies, was kindly provided by P. O’Hare. All plasmids used
for transfections with Transfast (Promega) were prepared
using Maxiprep Kit (Qiagen) while plasmids used for electro-
poration with Amaxa system (Amaxa) were purified using
Qiafilter Midi Kit (Qiagen).
Cell culture and reporter gene assays
HEK293T, HCT-116 and HeLa cells were gifted by the Insti-
tute of Genetics, Justus-Liebig University of Giessen while
COS-7 cells were provided by M. Stocks of MRC LMB,
Cambridge, UK. Cells were cultured in DMEM (PAA labora-
tories GmbH) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(PAA laboratories GmbH). Briefly, the HEK293T cells were
seeded in 24-well plates coated with polylysine, at the density
of 3–5 · 104 cells/well. Plasmids for co-transfection, which
included MTase gene vector (100–250 ng/well), GFP reporter
gene (200 ng/well), Renilla luciferase reporter gene control-
led by cytomegalovirus (CMV) (5 ng/well) (Promega) and
target firefly luciferase reporter gene (5–50 ng), were diluted
with serum free DMEM culture medium (200 ml/well) and
mixed with 1 ml Transfast reagent (Promega). The transfec-
tion was performed as recommended by the supplier. The
efficiency of transfection was monitored by green fluorescent
protein (GFP) signal count under fluorescence microscope.
Four days after transfection, the culture medium was removed
and cells were lysed by adding 300 ml lysis buffer from
Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Cat. E2810) to
each well. Samples of 100 and 20 ml crude cell lysate were
transferred to different wells of a non-transparent micro
well plate (Packard) for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity
assay, respectively. The luciferase activity (luminescence
signal) was determined by TopcountNXT Microplate
Scintillation & Luminescence Counter (Packard). In all trans-
fection experiments transfection yield and cell number was
normalized by co-transfection with a construct expressing
Renilla luciferase under the control of a CMV promoter.
Expression data refer to the ratio of firefly and Renilla lucifer-
ase expression. Luciferase activity is given as average and
standard deviation of at least three independent experiments
at different days and using different batches of cells.
Western blot analysis of protein expression
The expression of recombinant proteins and HSV-1 antigens
was monitored by western blot. Total cell lysates were

subjected to SDS–PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellu-
lose membranes. In the case of GBD fusion proteins the
expression was detected using anti-GBD antibody (Roche)
while c-myc epitope tagged proteins were detected using
mAb 9E10 (Santa Cruz). Viral proteins were detected using
LP1 mAb agaist VP16 (kindly donated by S. Efstathiou)
and rabbit polyclonal antibody against IE110k r191 (kindly
donated by R. Everett). The anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam)
was used to verify equal loading of total cell lysates. The
signal was detected by a secondary antibody fused to
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Roche) and visualized using
ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia). The same
membrane was stripped and re-blotted up to three times.
HSV-1 infection of transiently transfected cells
COS-7 cells have been grown to the confluency of 75% in
DMEM 10% FCS, harvested with Trypsin and electroporated
using Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems) according
to the manufacturers protocol optimized for this cell line.
Plasmid DNA used for these experiments included described
above constructs p6F6-3a, p6F6-3aE74A, pB1-3a and also
pmaxGFP (Amaxa) and p6F6KOX (23). Cells intended for
HSV-1 infection were seeded in 24-well cluster dishes at the
density of 0.5 · 106 cells/well and grown in DMEM 10%
FCS at 37C. The efficiency of transfection was estimated
at 20–24 h after electroporation by counting a number of GFP
positive cells in a sample of pmaxGFP (Amaxa)-transfected
cells and varied between 60 and 72%. At 20–22 h after
transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Following incubation in fresh medium supple-
mented with 10% FCS for 30 min, cells were infected
with HSV-1 strain 17 at the multiplicity of infection
(m.o.i.) of 0.05 p.f.u./cell in DMEM 2% FCS at 37C.
After 1 h of incubation HSV-1 suspension was removed
and cells were washed and incubated in 0.5 ml DMEM 2%
FCS per well at 37C for up to 45 h. At various time points,
post infection (p.i.) medium containing progeny virus was
harvested and used for plaque assays (see below) while cells
were washed in PBS and either harvested for western analysis
in 0.1 ml of protein loading buffer heated to 80C or
harvested for DNA extraction with DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen) and subsequent methylation studies.
Plaque assay
Medium samples containing HSV-1 have been serially dilu-
ted in DMEM 2% FCS and used to infect a confluent mono-
layer of COS-7 cells. Infection was performed in 6-well
cluster dishes containing 2 · 106 cells/well in a volume of
1 ml per well. After 1 h incubation at 37C, the virus suspen-
sion was removed and cells were overlaid with DMEM 2%
FCS supplemented with 1% CMC. Following incubation for
up to 96 h at 37C, cells were washed in PBS and fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 15 min. HSV-1 plaques were visualized
by incubation with 0.1% Toluidine Blue for 15 min at room
temperature and scored.
Bisulfite sequencing
To analyze targeted DNA methylation in the reporter systems
HEK293T cells were seeded in 6 cm plates, grown to
70–80% confluency and transfected using Transfast reagent
(Promega) with constructs encoding targeting MTases mixed
with target reporter gene at the ratio of 5:1 (GBD-3a or GBD-
3b: 5·UAS-TK-Luc ¼ 2 mg and 0.4 mg) or 20:1 (6F6-3a or
B1-3a: pGL3-IE175 ¼ 2 mg and 0.1 mg). After transfection
for 4 to 5 days, cells were harvested and washed with PBS
four times. Episomal DNA was isolated with modified
method as described (27) by Qiagen miniprep kit for plas-
mids. To analyze methylation of HSV-1 DNA, COS-7 cells
were transfected and infected as described above. At 30 h
p.i. cells were harvested and total cellular DNA (also contain-
ing HSV-1 DNA) was isolated using DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen). Purified DNA was digested by SalI for 4 h, purified
by Qiagen PCR purification Kit. Bisulfite conversion was
carried out as the standard procedure as described (28).
The converted DNA was amplified by PCR with primers
specific for the bisulfite converted template. The amplified
fragments were cloned into TOPO-TA vectors (Invitrogen
Life Technology Inc.) and individual clones were used for
sequencing.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis have been performed using two
flanked t-tests.
RESULTS
De novo DNA methylation targeted to UAS promoter
region by GAL4 DBD-MTase fusion constructs
To target DNA methylation to a predetermined site in human
cells, we fused the CDs of the de novo DNA MTases Dnmt3a
or Dnmt3b with the GBD. The resulting constructs were
named GBD-3a and GBD-3b, respectively (Figure 1A). The
GBD-3a and GBD-3b fusion proteins and all their variants
were transiently expressed at comparable levels in HEK293T
cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Targeted DNA methylation
was studied using the 5·UAS-TK-Luc reporter plasmid
that contains five repeats of the GAL4 binding sequence
(upstream activator sequence, UAS) inserted upstream of
the minimal TK promoter, which controls the firefly lucifer-
ase reporter gene (Figure 1A). The reporter plasmid was
co-transfected with the GBD-3a or GBD-3b construct into
HEK293T and 4–5 days after transfection, the reporter
DNA was retrieved and its methylation status analyzed by
bisulfite sequencing. In agreement with earlier observations
(29) no endogenous de novo methylation was detected either
on the TK promoter or the five UAS repeats when the reporter
construct was co-transfected with the vector expressing GBD
in the absence of the MTase domain (Figure 1B). In contrast,
when the reporter construct was co-transfected with GBD-3a
or GBD-3b, dense methylation on both TK promoter and the
UAS sequence, including its upstream flanking sequence, was
detected in the majority of the clones (Figure 1C). In the case
of GBD-3b, the methylation extends up to 80 bp into the
50 part of the TK promoter adjacent to the UAS sequence.
Altogether GBD-3b methylated DNA within a region of
230 bp containing 22 CG sites, which were methylated to
41%. In the case of GBD-3a, the targeted methylation
extended over the longer region comprising 330 bp and
37 CG sites methylated to 56% on average.

To confirm that the methylation of the 5·UAS-TK
depended on the specific DNA binding activity of GBD, a
double mutation (L32P and C38G) was introduced into
GBD that abolishes its DNA binding (25,26). To study depen-
dence of the targeted methylation on the catalytic activity of
the MTase domains, specific mutations were introduced into
catalytic motifs VI and II of Dnmt3a (ENV to ANV and
E74A, respectively) or motif VI of Dnmt3b (ENV to ANV)
that were known to inactivate the enzymes (17,24). When
the reporter gene was co-transfected with fusion proteins
containing the inactive MTase domain or the mutated GBD,
little or no methylation was observed (Figure 1D) although
the fusion constructs were expressed at the levels comparable
to the levels of GBD-3a and GBD-3b (Supplementary Figure 1).
Additionally, no methylation was observed within the firefly
luciferase coding sequence located >1000 bp downstream of
the target site, after co-transfection of 5·UAS-TK-Luc with
GBD-3a or GBD-3b (Figure 1E). These results demonstrate

carry an inactivated GBD domain. The MTase domain of the GBD-3a-ANV/E74A and GBD-3b-ANV is inactivated by mutations. (E) DNA methylation within

that the GBD-3a and GBD-3b fusion proteins specifically
methylate DNA in the neighborhood of their UAS target
sequence.
Targeted DNA methylation leads to specific repression
of gene expression
The influence of targeted DNA methylation on gene expres-
sion was investigated using 5·UAS-TK-Luc and TK-Luc
(without UAS) as a control. The firefly luciferase gene was
expressed at similar levels from both 5·UAS-TK-Luc and
TK-Luc in HEK293T cells (Supplmentary Figure 5). The
expression of the luciferase gene was strongly silenced after
in vitro methylation of the reporter plasmids by M.SssI,
which demonstrated the sensitivity of this promoter to DNA
methylation (Supplementary Figure 2). Co-transfection assays
showed that GBD-3a and GBD-3b repress the 5·UAS-TK
reporter gene expression by 6- and 3-fold, respectively
(Figure 2A), co-transfection with GBD expressing vector
did not influence expression (Supplementary Figure 5). To
confirm that the repression of the 5·UAS-TK depends on
the specific DNA binding activity of the GBD, the mutant
form of GBD was used that lacks specific DNA binding.
The fusion proteins comprising GBD-variant and Dnmt3a
or Dnmt3b were expressed at similar level, as the wild-type
forms (Supplementary Figure 1) but they have lost the ability
to repress the UAS-TK reporter gene almost completely
(Figure 2B and C). This finding demonstrates that specific
DNA binding by the GBD is necessary for targeted gene
silencing to occur. To further confirm this conclusion,

indicate the amount of DNA of each construct (ng/well in 24-well plate) used in each transfection.

5·UAS-TK-Luc and GBD-3a were co-transfected with
different amounts of the vector expressing only GBD (total
DNA content was equalized by adding an empty vector). In
this experiment GBD competes with GBD-3a for binding to
target sites but could not lead to methylation or gene silen-
cing. As shown in Figure 2F GBD reduces gene silencing
by GBD-3a in a concentration dependent manner. Similar
data were obtained for GBD-3b (data not shown). These
results confirm that the GBD-MTase fusion proteins were
targeted by GBD to the DNA.
To investigate whether the MTase activity is necessary for
the repression of the 5·UAS-TK reporter gene, the fusion
proteins comprising GBD and catalytically inactive Dnmt3a
or Dnmt3b domains were employed. We observed residual
repression of the 5·UAS-TK reporter gene with both cataly-
tically inactive variants (Figure 2B and C). However, in both
cases the loss of MTase activity significantly reduced the
level of repression of the 5·UAS-TK reporter (P-values:
1.3 · 102 for Dnmt3a and 1.2 · 103 for Dnmt3b). While
repression was almost 5.9-fold with the GBD-3a, the cataly-
tically inactive variant GBD-3a-AND-E74A only led to a
1.8-fold repression indicating that the efficiency of repression
is reduced 3-fold (Figure 2B). In the case of GBD-3b, the
level of repression was reduced from 2.7-fold with the active
MTase domain to 0.6-fold with the catalytically inactive
domain, which represents a 4.5-fold change in efficiency
(Figure 2C). The residual repression observed when the cata-
lytically inactive Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b domains were used,
might be caused by the interaction of these enzymes with
other proteins that repress gene expression (30–35). These
results demonstrate that the repression of the 5·UAS-TK
promoter by GBD-3a and GBD-3b was in part mediated by
DNA methylation. It is in agreement with the general view
that DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing, but it
is not the only process involved.
To explore whether a single GAL4 binding site is sufficient
to recruit GBD-3a or GBD-3b and repress the gene expres-
sion driven by the targeted promoter, the five UAS repeats
upstream of TK were replaced by a single one. As shown
in Figure 2D, the expression of the UAS-TK-Luc reporter
gene was repressed efficiently by GBD fused MTases. Inacti-
vation of the MTase domain reduced repression 2.8- and
4.8-fold for GBD-3a and GBD-3b, respectively, (P-values
2.9 · 102 and 3.7 · 104) indicating that MTase activity
was important for the repression. Additional co-transfection
assays in HCT-116 and HeLa cells showed that the repression
of the reporter gene by GBD-3b (Supplementary Figure 3)
or GBD-3a (data not shown) was not cell type dependent.
Targeted gene silencing of the human c-Ha-ras
promoter
To explore whether targeted methylation and gene silencing
can be also achieved with promoter sequences other than
TK, human Ha-ras promoter was used. The firefly luciferase
reporter gene under the control of the ras promoter was fused
to a single UAS sequence upstream of the promoter (UAS-
ras-Luc). A ras-Luc construct without the UAS was used as
a control. Expression levels of luciferase from both constructs
were identical (Supplementary Figure 6). In vitro methylation
of the UAS-ras promoter by M.SssI resulted in the complete
silencing of the promoter (Supplementary Figure 2). UAS-
ras-Luc and ras-Luc reporter gene constructs were co-
transfected into HEK293T cells with the plasmids encoding
GBD-MTases. As shown in Figure 2E, the expression of
ras-Luc was not affected by either GBD-3a or GBD-3b,
while expression of UAS-ras-Luc was repressed by both
GBD-3a and GBD-3b. The mutations in the CD of Dnmt3a
and 3b resulted in an almost complete loss of repression
(P-values <105 and 9 · 104 for GBD-3a and GBD-3b)
indicating that targeted DNA methylation causes the silen-
cing of reporter gene expression.
Targeted methylation of HSV-1 IE175k promoter by
synthetic zinc-finger DBDs fused to the CD of Dnmt3a
Having shown that (i) chimeric MTases that contain GBD
are capable of targeting methylation to predetermined DNA
sites in the cell and (ii) the site-specific methylation by
GBD-methyltransferases leads to silencing of target promo-
ters, we set to develop a more universal system for targeting
MTases to any DNA site. Over the past decade, Cys2His2
zinc fingers have emerged as universal DBD, which can be
engineered to bind potentially any given DNA sequence
(36,37). To validate the feasibility of targeting DNA methy-
lation with zinc finger DBDs to facilitate gene repression,
two engineered zinc-finger proteins B1 and 6F6, previously
shown to bind specifically within the same target sequence
in the HSV-1 immediate early gene IE175k promoter (23),
were fused to the CD of Dnmt3a (Figure 3A). B1 and 6F6
comprise three and six zinc fingers, respectively, and 6F6
binds to the target site with much higher affinity (23).
The B1/6F6 binding site is one of the two sites in IE175k
promoter, which during HSV-1 infection is bound by the
transcriptional activation complex containing VP16 (38).
To determine whether these synthetic zinc-finger DBDs
could direct the CD of Dnmt3a to the target DNA sequence
and facilitate DNA methylation, the luciferase reporter
gene was cloned under the control of the IE175k promoter
(IE175-Luc in Figure 3A), and the reporter plasmid was
co-transfected with B1-3a or 6F6-3a into HEK293T cells.
Both 6F6-3a and B1-3a were expressed at comparable levels
(data not shown). Four days after transfection, episomal DNA
was extracted and DNA methylation analyzed by bisulfite
sequencing. As shown in Figure 3B, almost no methylation
was observed in IE175k promoter co-transfected with the
6F6 zinc-finger DBD alone (lacking MTase domain) while
co-transfection with B1-3a resulted in 57 CGs within the
IE175k sequence being methylated to 81% on average
(Figure 3C). The two CG sites within the B1/6F6 binding
site were methylated to 96%. In co-transfection of IE175k
promoter with 6F6-3a, slightly lower levels of methylation
were observed (the average methylation density was 53%)
(Figure 3C). Our finding that the level of methylation by
6F6-3a is lower than in a case of B1-3a, despite 6F6 binding
DNA with much higher affinity (23), could be explained
by B1 exhibiting a higher koff from the DNA, which might
allow more efficient methylation of the DNA in the vicinity
of the target site.
To study the specificity of targeting, the B1/6F6 zinc-
finger binding sequence GATCGGGCGgTAATGAGAT was
deleted from the IE175k promoter (IE175mut-Luc Figure 3A).

As shown in Figure 3D, there was almost no methylation det-
ected on the mutated IE175k promoter after co-transfection
with B1-3a or 6F6-3a. In addition, no methylation was
detected either in the region of the luciferase gene 1 kb
downstream from the promoter or within the CMV promoter
that drives expression of the Renilla luciferase gene, used for
internal normalization of transfection efficiency (Figure 3E).
Furthermore, we analyzed methylation at two CG islands in
the unrelated promoter regions of the SON and TTC3 genes
which are both unmethylated. After transfection with 6F6-3a

we did not observe major changes of the methylation level
(Supplementary Figure 4). These results demonstrate that
the B1-3a and 6F6-3a proteins cause a specific methylation
at the IE175k target site. The catalytic activity of the
Dnmt3a as well as the zinc-finger DBD and the intact
zinc-finger binding site were all necessary for the targeted
methylation.
Targeted methylation leads to specific repression
of HSV-1 IE175k promoter
To determine the sensitivity of the IE175k promoter to DNA
methylation, the IE175-Luc plasmid was methylated in vitro
by M.SssI, and then transfected into HEK293T cells. The
results indicated that the IE175k promoter is highly sensitive
to DNA methylation both in the presence and in the absence
of VP16, which is a HSV-1 encoded transcriptional activator
of this promoter (Supplementary Figure 2).
In co-transfection reporter gene assays, the 6F6 zinc-finger
protein was used as a control. The 6F6 itself did not repress
the expression of IE175-Luc under these conditions (data
not shown). At 72 h after co-transfection with IE175-Luc,
both B1-3a and 6F6-3a caused repression of IE175-Luc by
2 to 3-fold (Figure 4A). The repressive effect of 6F6-3a on
IE175k was reduced significantly when the catalytically inac-
tive E74A variant of Dnmt3a was used (P-value: 3.5 · 103).
Residual repression with the inactive variant was only
0.4-fold, which corresponds to a 4.4-fold reduced efficiency
of silencing in the absence of targeted DNA methylation.
To study the specificity of repression, the B1/6F6 zinc-finger
binding sequence was deleted from the promoter. The dele-
tion itself increased the basal expression from this promo-
ter (Supplementary Figure 7). Interestingly, both B1-3a and
6F6-3a lost the ability to repress the mutated IE175-Luc,
indicating that the B1 and 6F6 zinc finger DBDs direct the
activity of the Dnmt3a CD to their target sites. This conclu-
sion was further confirmed by a competition experiment,
which showed that the addition of 6F6 alone inhibits gene
silencing mediated by 6F6-3a in a concentration dependent
manner (Figure 4B).
Targeted methylation causes a reduction of HSV-1
titer during HSV-1 lytic infection
Having demonstrated that targeted methylation can be
achieved using zinc fingers as DBD and that HSV-1 IE175k
promoter can be silenced by such methylation in the reporter
system, an attempt was made to determine if a similar effect
can be observed during HSV-1 infection. The IE175k tran-
scriptional regulator targeted here is one of the first viral
genes to be expressed and it directly induces early and late
genes (39). In order to test if 6F6-3a and B1-3a are capable
of (i) accessing their binding sites in HSV-1 DNA during
viral infection and (ii) inhibiting IE175k gene activity by
targeted methylation of its promoter, COS-7 cells were firstly
transfected with plasmids expressing either active chimeric
Mtases (6F6-3a or B1-3a) or control proteins. The controls
included constructs expressing zinc finger domain 6F6 fused
to either mutant Dnmt3a (6F6-3a-E74A) or KRAB repression
domain of KOX-1 (6F6-KOX) (23,40). The subsequent infec-
tion with wt HSV-1 strain 17 was carried out at a low m.o.i.
of 0.05 p.f.u./cell. At various times p.i. cells were harvested
and used to isolate total DNA, which included HSV-1 DNA.
The methylation of the IE175k promoter was studied by
bisulfite sequencing of viral DNA purified from infected
cells expressing targeted MTases (Figure 5). As shown in
Figure 5B after 30 h, most clones exhibited a low methylation
of HSV-1 DNA of below 10% after correction for incomplete
conversion, (which was between 5 and 10% in the various
clones). The higher level of basal methylation observed
here as compared to the other experiments, could be due to
the different host cells used or a stimulation of the endogen-
ous methylation activity by the viral infection. It has been
shown that infection with several viruses including HIV-1,
hepatitis B, adenovirus and Epstein–Barr virus up regulates
DNA MTases (41–44). In addition, a Kaposi’s sarcoma-
associated herpes virus protein has been shown to recruit
Dnmt3a to DNA (45).
The methylation levels of the 6F6-KOX and 6F6-3a-E74A
samples were identical (P-value: 0.23). Significantly, when
HSV-1 was propagated in cells expressing either the 6F6-
KOX or 6F6-3a-E74A control proteins, no clones were
methylated above 30%. However, in cells expressing 6F6-
3a about one-third of all clones displayed a dense methylation
of >30%. In cells expressing B1-3a, the fraction of highly
methylated clones was lower. Using the 6F6-KOX and
6F6-3a-E74A data as reference a two flanked t-test indicates
high significance of these changes (P-value <0.01). This

Luc reporter plasmids were co-transfected with 6F6, 6F6-3a, B1-3a or 6F6-

binding site for the engineered zinc finger protein B1/6F6. The Dnmt3a-E74A
variant is catalytically inactive. The luciferase activity of reporter gene
co-transfected with 6F6 was set to 100%. The error bars indicate the standard
deviations of at least three independent experiments. (B) Competition between

DNA in each transfection was normalized by adding an empty vector.

result indicates that the 6F6-3a construct is able to methylate
HSV-1 DNA while the virus propagates in the cell. It has to
be noted that potentially, methylation can occur on the initial
as well as on the progeny HSV-1 DNA, during the progress of
the lytic infection.
The lower level of methylation observed with the active
DNA MTases as compared to the previous co-transfection
experiments can be explained as follows (i) in these experi-
ments targeted DNA methylation has to be introduced against
the rapid DNA replication of the viral genome (ii) only DNA

isolated from the cells that were originally transfected with
6F6-3a or B1-3a constructs (60%) could be specifically
methylated while viral DNA isolated from untransfected
cell (40%) remains unaffected. In the previous experiments
co-transfection of reporter gene and targeted MTase con-
structs ensured that in the majority of cells reporter plasmids
co-existed with the MTase.
Further we examined the impact of methylation of the
IE175k promoter on HSV-1 lytic cycle at low m.o.i. The
HSV-1 virus was propagated in cells transiently expressing
either one of the chimeric MTases (6F6-3a or B1-3a) or
control zinc finger proteins (6F6-3a-E74A or 6F6-KOX) as
described above. All these proteins were expected to have
some inhibitory effect on HSV-1 propagation, since all of
them contain engineered zinc finger DBDs designed to com-
pete with HSV-1 activator VP16 for binding to the B1/6F6
site (23). At 30 and 45 h p.i. cells and corresponding culture
media samples containing viral progeny, were harvested. The
lysates of the cells that express different zinc finger fusion
proteins after infection with wt HSV-1 were analyzed by wes-
tern blots (Figure 6A). In the cells expressing the chimeric
MTases 6F6-3a and B1-3a, HSV-1 infection cycle was
progressing slower as indicated by lower levels of immediate
early protein IE110k and late protein VP16 after 30 h, when
compared with the cells expressing control fusion proteins
and cells transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA 3.1), in
which HSV-1 propagates the fastest.
The comparable amounts of viral proteins in 6F6-3a and
control samples observed at 45 h p.i. indicate that at that late
time point a similar fraction of surviving cells are infected.
This suggests that the protection offered by the targeted
MTase is less efficient during the later phases of the experi-
ment, when secondary infection is expected to take place
at higher m.o.i. This is in agreement with additional experi-
ments carried out at higher initial m.o.i. (data not shown).
In the control experiments (6F6-3a-E74A and 6F6-KOX) at
45 h many cells have already released progeny virus and
have been lysed. Therefore, their viral protein content is no
longer detected in Figure 6A.
Having shown that the presence of chimeric methylases
can alter the levels of expression of HSV-1 proteins during
the course of primary infection (30 h), we were interested
to determine if methylation of HSV-1 DNA in the region
of IE175k promoter affects the final titer of viable viral
particles. To this end, the medium containing progeny virus
particles was harvested at different times after infection of
the cell expressing the active chimeric MTases (6F6-3A or
B1-3a) or the 6F6-KOX and 6F6-3a-E74A control proteins,
and the number of progeny virus particles was determined.
As shown in Figure 6B, a significant reduction in the number
of infectious particles was observed in the presence of 6F6-3a
(P-values <105). This effect is already detectable at 30 h
post infection and it becomes very prominent at 45 h
p.i. when the viral titer is more than 18-fold lower than
the titer obtained from cells expressing 6F6-3a-E74A. A
significant reduction was also observed when HSV-1 infec-
tion was carried out in the cells expressing B1-3a (P-values
<105).
From the comparison of Figure 6A and B it should be
noticed that Figure 6A shows the amount of viral proteins
in cells that are still alive, while Figure 6B shows the total
amount of infectious viral particles that accumulated through-
out the complete experiment. In the time interval from 30 to
45 h p.i. the viral titer increased slower in the presence of
6F6-3a or B1-3a than in the control experiments (6F6-3a-
E74A and 6F6-KOX), where in after 30 h the infection was
already well advanced as indicated by the western blot results
(Figure 6A). In contrast, in cells expressing 6F6-3a or B1-3a
the infection was clearly delayed at 30 h, which accounts for
fewer virus progeny produced in the time interval between 30
and 45 h p.i. This result indicates that expression of 6F6-3a,
and to a lesser extent also B1-3a, can inhibit HSV-1 propa-
gation in a cell culture system.
The 18-fold reduction in HSV-1 titer in the presence of
6F6-3a is noteworthy taking into account that (i) only the
portion of transiently transfected cells (60%) expresses
6F6-3a or other fusion proteins and (ii) methylation-mediated
inhibition of HSV-1, in our system, is measured against a
control where HSV-1 is grown in the presence of the cataly-
tically inactive 6F6-3a-E74A mutant. This fusion protein,
however, is still capable of binding to the B1/6F6 site and,
therefore, competing with the VP16 activation complex.
Therefore the overall inhibitory effect of 6F6-3a on HSV-1
propagation could be considered to be even greater, when
viewed as a combination of effects exerted by targeted
DNA methylation by Dmnt3a and promoter blocking by
the 6F6 DBD.

proteins. The error bars give the standard deviation of at least three
independent experiments.

DISCUSSION
In this study we have demonstrated that DNA methylation
can be targeted to predetermined promoter regions and
efficiently repress reporter gene expression. Targeted DNA
methylation was achieved by fusing natural or engineered
DBDs to the CD of mouse de novo DNA MTase Dnmt3a
or 3b. DNA methylation and gene silencing were abolished
when catalytically inactive DNA MTases were used, the
DBD was mutated, or the target sequence in the promoter
region was deleted. Therefore, it provides the evidence that
targeted gene methylation can be directly responsible for
gene silencing.
The stable silencing of gene expression by DNA methy-
lation observed here suggests that targeted DNA methylation
could provide a powerful technology for specific gene silen-
cing. Unregulated gene expression is often a central mechan-
ism of disease. For example viral infections are characterized
by the preferential expression of viral genes, and in cancer,
up-regulated expression of oncogenes is frequently observed.
Silencing of such genes by transcriptional inactivation could
be an approach for therapy of these diseases. Furthermore,
gene silencing by targeted methylation that is specific and
stable could have applications in basic research and could
be eventually used to directly correct some epigenetic defects
as observed in many cancers (46). However, before a thera-
peutic application of the targeted methylation approach
presented here could be considered, a genome wide scan for
non-target methylation is required.
While we have shown that targeted methylation is a feasi-
ble approach to repress the propagation of viral infections
in cell culture it ought to be compared with the previous
approaches, which used engineered zinc finger DBDs fused
to repressor domains (23,47–49). The advantage of using
targeted DNA methylation for gene silencing over the use of
a gene repressor like the KRAB domain of KOX-1, is that
the MTase has a direct enzymatic activity. Therefore, lower
efficiency of targeting can lead to stable inhibition. Moreover,
the DNA MTase introduces a permanent silencing imprint on
DNA, which is propagated in vivo and remains stable even
after dissociation of the modifying fusion protein. In agree-
ment with this hypothesis we show here that 6F6-3a is signif-
icantly more efficient in gene silencing than 6F6-KOX
(Figure 6B). In addition, B1-3a showed similar efficacy as
6F6-KOX in the present study, while B1-KOX was much
less efficient than 6F6-KOX (23).
Evidence from various studies suggests that in the bio-
logical context Dnmt3a and 3b are targeted to specific
genomic sites by interaction with other proteins, which bind
either DNA or chromatin, such as RP58, HP1, c-myc, PU.1,
SETDB1, Mbd3, Hdac1, Brg1 or p53 (31,32,50–54). We
observed that targeted methylation induces dense methylation
of DNA regions comprising up to 380 bp on both sides of the
specific DNA binding site. In contrast, in their pioneering
study conducted in vitro, Xu and Bestor have observed that
a Zif268-M.SssI fusion protein methylates single CG sites
16–22 bp upstream of the Zif268 binding site (18). This dif-
ference suggests that the initial methylation by Dnmt3a or 3b,
targeted to the DNA by a heterologous DBD, might serve as a
trigger for an epigenetic response. For example, the targeted
methylation could induce histone 3 lysine 9 methylation and
histone deacetylation (55–58). In turn, these responses could
trigger additional DNA methylation (59–62). Alternatively,
spreading of methylation could be mediated by Dnmt1,
which could be recruited to DNA by Dnmt3a (63,64). Our
data suggest that the CD of Dnmt3a and 3b are able to recruit
endogenous gene silencing activities.
In summary, our study demonstrates for the first time
in transient co-transfection experiments that, targeted DNA
methylation can be employed for gene silencing in human
cells. Using this approach we silenced different promoters
including the human Ha-ras oncogene promoter and the viral
IE175k promoter by targeted methylation and demonstrated
that, targeted DNA methylation antagonizes viral infection
in the cell culture model. Whether this approach is also
applicable to endogenous genes in the context of natural chro-
matin needs further investigation. For anti-viral applications,
fusion to a more active DNA MTase domain might provide
a stronger and less transient protective effect, that might
justify proceeding to animal studies. Furthermore, for future
application of this technique, the problem of MTase delivery
to the target tissue has to be solved.
