ABSTRACT
We have developed a method for transferring
exogenous DNA molecules into isolated mammalian
mitochondria using bacterial conjugation. In general,
we accomplish this by (i) inserting an origin of DNA
transfer (oriT) sequence into a DNA construct, (ii)
transforming the construct into an appropriate
Escherichia coli strain and then (iii) introducing the
mobilizable DNA into mitochondria through conjuga-
tion. We tested this approach by transferring plasmid
DNA containing a T7 promoter sequence into mito-
chondria that we had engineered to contain T7 RNA
polymerase. After conjugation between E.coli and
mitochondria, we detected robust levels of T7 tran-
scription from the DNA constructs that had been
transferred into the mitochondria. This approach for
engineering DNA constructs in vitro and subsequent
transfer into mitochondria by conjugation offers an
attractive experimental system for studying many
aspects of vertebrate mitochondrial gene expression
and is a potential route for transforming mitochon-
drial networks within mammalian cells.
INTRODUCTION
The typical animal cell contains a complex mitochondrial
network that produces the majority of the cell’s ATP through
oxidative phosphorylation (1). The 13 proteins, 2 rRNAs and
22 tRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
genome are critical for normal cellular energy metabolism,
and mutations in this mtDNA molecule are known to cause
a wide range of human diseases (2).
An elegant and effective method for the genetic trans-
formation of mitochondria using a biolistic ‘gene gun’ appar-
atus has been described previously (3,4), but to date this
approach has been limited to the transformation of mitochon-
dria in yeast and closely related organisms. Despite the high
level of interest in mammalian mitochondrial genomes, no
practical methods have yet been developed for introducing
biologically active exogenous DNA into the mitochondrial
networks of mammalian cells. Relatively small linear DNA
fragments have been transported into mitochondria by cova-
lently linking either oligonucleotides (5) or double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) (6) to mitochondrial-targeting peptides, and
recently cationic liposome- (7) and peptide nucleic acid-
mediated DNA transfer (8,9) have been tried. Much larger
plasmid DNA molecules have been introduced into isolated
mammalian mitochondria by electroporation (10,11) but the
electroporation conditions used in these procedures appear to
cause irreparable damage to the mitochondria that prevents
their reincorporation back into mammalian cells (Y.G. Yoon,
unpublished data). A recent paper has reported that exogenous
DNA can be introduced into the mitochondria of human cells
using a process dubbed ‘protofection’ (12), but the data pre-
sented to support this claim are not conclusive and the process
has not yet been duplicated by other investigators.
In this report, we describe and demonstrate the feasibility of
a new mitochondrial transformation system involving
bacteria-to-mitochondria conjugation. Because conjugation
is a relatively gentle process, we reasoned that this type of
procedure would enable us to transfer large DNA constructs
into mitochondria without damaging the structural integrity of
the mitochondria. Although conjugation typically involves
bacterium-to-bacterium DNA transfer via pili, the conjugation
process is driven entirely by molecular machinery in the donor
cell (13) and so an amazingly broad range of cell types can
serve as the DNA recipient, including yeast (14,15), plants
(16) and mammalian cells (17,18).
When a conjugative-competent donor cell contacts a suit-
able recipient, the donor bacteria forms a mating bridge and a
nick is made within the origin of DNA transfer (oriT) sequence
in the mobilizing plasmid. Extension of the 30 end of the oriT
nick displaces a single strand that is then transferred into the
recipient. The TraI enzyme that catalyzes both the first and the
second nicking events binds covalently to the 50 end of
the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and guides the DNA
from the donor cell to the recipient through the mating

bridge (13). The second nicking event at the mating bridge
liberates one unit length of the plasmid and supplies the 30
terminal end for circularization (13). DNA molecules as large
as the entire 4.7 Mb Escherichia coli chromosome can be
transferred by conjugation (19), but smaller molecules are
transferred more quickly and efficiently.
We chose to utilize the transfer genes and the oriT sequence
from the conjugative plasmid RP4 (13,20,21) in this mitochon-
drial transformation procedure because the conjugative func-
tions of this plasmid are both well characterized and efficient.
We tested the ability of the RP4 conjugative system to transfer
DNA into the matrix of mammalian mitochondria by using a
mobilizable plasmid containing a T7 promoter sequence and
purified mouse mitochondria that we had engineered to con-
tain T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) within their matrix. After
conjugation between E.coli and these isolated mitochondria,
we detected robust levels of T7 transcription from the DNA
constructs that had been transferred into the mitochondrial
matrix. To our knowledge, this is the first example of con-
jugative DNA transfer into mitochondria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
E.coli strains, cell lines and culture media
E.coli strain DH5a, used as a host for all cloning experiments,
was grown at 37C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium, supple-
mented with 12.5 mg tetracycline/ml or 50 mg ampicillin/ml for
TcR plasmid- or AmpR plasmid-containing strains. E.coli S17-1
(ATCC 47055) (20) was used as the donor strain for conjuga-
tive crosses. The mouse cell line LL/2 (ATCC CRL-1642) was
grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) in the
presence of heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at
37C in a humidified 10% CO2 incubator. HeLa 229 (ATCC
CCL-2.1) was cultured in MEM alpha (Life Technologies)
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37C in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator.
DNA manipulation
Mini-scale preparations of plasmid DNA were prepared by
the alkaline lysis method (22) and large quantities of plasmid
DNA were prepared by the PEG precipitation method and
other recombinant DNA techniques were performed essen-
tially as described previously (22). Restriction enzymes and
T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs
(Beverly, MA) and used as recommended by the manufacturer.
Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was purchased from Strat-
agene (La Jolla, CA) and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was
purchased from Applied Biosystems (Branchburg, NJ).
Deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized from Life Tech-
nologies (Rockville, MD) or Integrated DNA Technologies
(Coralville, IA).
Construction of plasmids
For the construction of mitochondria-targeting gene expres-
sion vector, the 24 N-terminal amino acids mitochondrial
leader sequence of the mouse mitochondrial transcription
factor A (TFAM) (23) was amplified by PCR using primers
50-musmtTFA (50-AG GAATTC GCTAGC GTC GGC CCG
AGC GAT GGC-30, EcoRI and NheI restriction sites
underlined, respectively) and mtTFA30NruI (50-GG GGTACC
TCGCGA GGA AAA ACA CTT CGG AAT-30, KpnI and
NruI restriction sites underlined, respectively) and cloned
between the NheI and KpnI sites of pcDNA6/HisA after
digestion of the PCR products with NheI and KpnI. The
2.7 kb T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) gene obtained by PCR
amplification was then cloned into NruI and BamHI sites
of the vector, resulting in pcDNA6-musTFAML-T7RNAP
(Figure 2A). The GFP gene was also cloned between NruI
and XhoI sites of the vector to test the mitochondrial-targeting
function of the leader sequence, resulting in pcDNA6-
musTFAML-GFP (Figure 2A). The mobilizing plasmids
that contain the T7 promoter sequences were constructed
using pTANTS (24). The GFP gene was amplified by PCR,
in which one PCR primer contains the T7 promoter (PT7)
sequence (SmaT7ProGFP, 50-GGG TAA TAC GAC TCA

T7 promoter sequence underlined; GFP30Sal, 50-AGT GTC
GAC TTA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CA-30, SalI restriction
sites underlined) and cloned in SmaI/SalI sites of pTANTS.
T7 terminator sequence was also synthesized, annealed and
cloned in SalI/SphI sites. Then, the complementary sequences
of T7 promoter (T7hp) were synthesized, annealed and cloned
in the EcoRI/SmaI sites (T7ds1, 50-CCG GGA GTG AGT
CGT ATT ACC CTC CCA TGT TGA TGG GA-30; T7ds2,
50-TCC CAT CAA CAT GGG AGG GTA ATA CGA CTC
ACT CCC GGG TAC-30), resulting pT7hpGFP (Figure 4A).
The oriT sequence was amplified from plasmid pRK290 (21)
by PCR (HIIIOriT, 50-AGC CAT AAG CTT GCC CTC ATC
TGT TAC-30, HindIII restriction sites underlined; SphOriT, 50-
GTA GAG CAT GCA CAA AAC AGC AGG GAA-30, SphI
restriction sites underlined) and cloned in the SphI/HindIII
sites, resulting in pT7hpGFP+oriT (Figure 4A).
Generation of cell lines expressing
mitochondria-targeted T7RNAP
To make a mouse cell line expressing T7RNAP targeted
to mitochondria, 10 mg of the expression vector pcDNA6-
musTFAML-T7RNAP (Figure 2A) was linearized with
BglII and transfected into the mouse LL/2 cells. Transfection
of the cell was performed using the calcium phosphate method
(25), and stable cell lines expressing mitochondria-targeted
T7RNAP were selected with blasticidin (5 mg/ml) for 2 weeks.
A clonal LL/2-T7mt cell line was obtained by diluting these
blasticidin-resistant cells to a single cell per well on 96-well
plates. The cloned cells were then cultured in normal medium
supplemented with 3 mg/ml of blasticidin. To verify the
mitochondrial-targeting function of the mouse TFAM leader
peptide, HeLa 229 was transiently transfected with pcDNA6-
musTFAML-GFP (Figure 2A), and the green fluorescent
protein (GFP) expression and localization were examined in
these cells (Figure 2B).
Electroporation of mitochondria
These experiments were performed using the method
described previously (11). Cells were harvested by centrifu-
gation, washed twice with 1 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.0, 0.13 M
NaCl, 5 mM KCl and 7.5 mM MgCl2. The cell pellet was
resuspended in half the cell volume with 1/10· IB (4 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM MgCl2) and the cells
e139 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 16 PAGE 2 OF 8
were broken using a Pellet Pestle tissue grinder (Kontes,
Vineland, NJ). The homogenate was mixed with one-ninth
of the packed cell volume of 10· IB resulting in a buffer
concentration of 1· IB. The unbroken cells and nuclei
were removed by two consecutive low-speed centrifugations
(5 min at 320 g). The supernatant was placed into new 1.5 ml
tubes and centrifuged at full speed (10 min at 15 800 g) to
obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet. Mitochondria were rinsed
once with 500 ml of 1· IB, centrifuged again at full speed for
10 min and resuspened into 0.33 M sucrose/10% glycerol
(100 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml) for electroporation.
An aliquot of 1 mg of plasmid DNA was added to 50 ml of
100 mg/ml of mitochondrial suspension and the mixture was
transferred into a cold electroporation cuvette (0.1 cm gap
cuvette; Bio-Rad). Electroporation was then carried out
using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at a capacitance of 25 mF, a
resistance of 400 W and field strength of 12 kV/cm. After the
electric pulse, 1 ml of incubation buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol) was
added to the cuvette, rapidly mixed by pipetting, transferred to
a new tube and washed three times with the incubation buffer
by centrifugation.
In organello RNA synthesis
The final mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 50 ml
of the incubation buffer supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate,
1 mM ATP and 1 mg/ml BSA and incubated at 37C for 2 h
(26). For labeling of mitochondrial RNA, 10 mCi of
[a-32P]UTP was also added to the incubation buffer (26).
After incubation, the mitochondrial suspension was pel-
leted by centrifugation and washed twice with incubation
buffer. The pellets were suspended in 200 ml of DNase I buffer
(10% glycerol, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2)
and incubated with 200 Kunitz units of DNase I (Sigma)
at 37C for 30 min. The mitochondria were then pel-
leted and washed twice with washing buffer (10% glycerol,
10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) to inactivate and
remove the nucleases. Total RNA was then prepared dir-
ectly from the mitochondria using Trizol Reagent (Life
Technologies).
Conjugation between E.coli and isolated
T7RNAP-mitochondria
Conjugative crosses were performed by mixing mid-
logarithmic phase E.coli (OD600 ¼ 0.50.6) and isolated
mitochondria in LB medium. Briefly, 100 ml of 100 mg/ml
mitochondrial suspension, which was isolated from the LL/
2-T7mt cell line (T7RNAP-mitochondria), were mixed with
200 ml of rapidly growing E.coli. After discarding the super-
natant by centrifugation, the mating mixture was resuspended
with 25 ml of fresh LB. Then, 25 ml of 1% low-melting point
agarose was added to the mating mixture and the mating
mixture/agarose mixture was put on ice for 1 min to make
an agarose block. Fresh LB (500 ml) was added to the mating
mixture/agarose block and incubated at 37C by gentle
shaking for 5 h. After 5 h incubation, the mating mixture/
agarose block was incubated for additional 2 h at 37C
with 200 mg/ml of ampicillin, 200 Kunitz units of DNase I
and 50 mg/ml of RNase A to lyse E.coli and to remove any
nucleic acids outside of the mitochondria. Supernatant from
the mating mixture/agarose block was removed gently by
pipetting, and the agarose block was washed twice with
fresh LB. After removal of the LB media, 1 ml of Trizol
was added directly to the mating mixture/agarose block and
total RNA was prepared as recommended by the manufacturer
(Trizol Reagent, Life Technologies).
RT–PCR analysis
Total RNAs from the T7RNAP-mitochondria mating
mixture or from electroporated mitochondria were collected
by isopropyl alcohol precipitation, and residual DNA con-
taminants were removed using RNase-free DNase I (Promega,
Madison, WI) as directed by the manufacturer. RT–PCR
analysis was then carried out using a SuperScript First-
Strand Synthesis system (Life Technologies) and the fol-
lowing primers: EGFPinternal (50-GAC GAC GGC AAC
TAC AAG AC-30) and GFP30Sal (50-AGT GTC GAC TTA
CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CA-30) for the GFP gene
transcription and CmR-F (50-GTA CCT ATA ACC AGA
CCG TTC AGC-30) and CmR-R (50-CAG CGG CAT CAG
CAC CTT GTC-30) for the CAT gene transcription. The fol-
lowing PCR cycle parameters were used for each of the
RT–PCRs: 95C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95C
for 30 s, 55C or 60C for 45 s and 72C for 30 s, and finally
72C for 10 min.
RESULTS
Experimental design
We have devised a method for transferring engineered DNA
constructs into mitochondria using bacterial conjugation
(Figure 1). We used E.coli S17-1, which carries the genes
for DNA transfer functions from the broad host range plasmid
RP4 (20), as the donor bacterial strain and cloned the oriT
sequence from RP4 (21) into our DNA constructs in order to
specifically target them for mobilization. To test this approach,
we designed an assay system that used isolated mitochondria
containing T7RNAP in their matrix as conjugative recipients
and cloned a T7 transcription promoter into our DNA con-
structs. Because the DNA transferred by conjugation is single
stranded (13), we constructed the mobilizing plasmid in such a
manner that a double-stranded hairpin-loop containing a tran-
scriptionally active T7 promoter (27,28) will form from the
mobilized ssDNA (Figure 4B). When these DNA molecules
are transferred from E.coli into the mitochondrial matrix, the
T7RNAP initiates transcription from the T7 promoter in the
hairpin-loop and generates RNA transcripts that we can read-
ily assay by RT–PCR. We ensure that only RNA transcribed in
structurally intact mitochondria are measured in this RT–PCR
assay by selectively lysing the E.coli donor cells and then
subjecting the mitochondrial solution to high levels of
DNase and RNase prior to isolating the in organello RNA
transcripts.
Targeting of T7RNAP into the mitochondrial matrix
We constructed expression vectors to selectively deliver
polypeptides into the mitochondrial matrix by fusing the
mitochondrial leader sequence from the mouse Tfam gene
(23) in frame with the T7RNAP or GFP coding sequence.

Maps of these two vectors are shown in Figure 2A.
Because the mitochondrial leader peptide from TFAM
has not yet been well characterized, the subcellular localiza-
tion of recombinant polypeptides from this novel expression
vector was confirmed by microscopic analysis of GFP
targeted to mitochondria. HeLa 229 cells that were trans-
iently transfected with the chimeric TFAML-GFP vector
(Figure 2A) are shown in Figure 2B. We found that the
GFP expressed in these cells was localized in the mito-
chondrial network, as expected, without detectable levels of
cytoplasmic expression.
We then used the TFAML-T7RNAP vector to construct a
stable cell line expressing T7RNAP targeted to mitochondria
using mouse LL/2 cells with blasticidin selection and cloned a
single cell that showed correct expression of T7RNAP by RT–
PCR analysis. To test whether or not the T7RNAP targeted to
these mitochondria can initiate transcription from exogenously
transferred DNA, we electroporated a control plasmid (pUC-
T7CAT, Figure 3A) into mitochondria isolated from LL/
2-T7mt using previously described conditions (see Materials
and Methods) (11). We then incubated the electroporated
mitochondria in a buffer suitable for in organello RNA
synthesis for 2 h at 37C, washed three times and added
200 Kunitz units of DNase I to remove any DNA outside
the electroporated mitochondria. Total RNA from these mito-
chondria was purified and RT–PCR analyses were performed
using the CAT-specific primers CmR-R and CmR-F (see
Materials and Methods) to identify the T7RNAP-generated
RNA transcripts from the electroporated plasmid DNA. As
shown in Figure 3B (lane 4), RT–PCR CAT products of the
expected size (470 bp) were clearly detected in the electropo-
rated T7RNAP-mitochondria. No signal was detected in the
control reactions without reverse transcriptase (RT)
(Figure 3B, lanes 1 and 3) or in the ‘no electroporation’ con-
trol, in which plasmid pUC-T7CAT was mixed with isolated
T7RNAP-mitochondria without electroporation (Figure 3B,
lanes 1 and 2).
Figure 1. Conjugation between E.coli and mitochondrion containing T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP). When a conjugative-competent E.coli contacts a mitochon-
drion, the donor bacteria forms a mating bridge (arrows) and a nick is made within the oriT sequence (black box) in the plasmid by the TraI enzyme (open circle),
which binds covalently to the freed 50 end (13). Extension of the 30 end of the oriT nick displaces a single strand and TraI guides the DNA from E.coli to the
mitochondrion through the mating bridge. The second nicking event at oriT liberates 1 U length of the plasmid and supplies the 30 terminal end for circularization.
T7RNAP then starts transcription from the T7 promoter in the transferred DNA and the newly synthesized RNA transcripts (dotted lines) are assayed by RT–PCR.

humidified CO2 incubator.

Construction of mobilizing plasmids and donor
E.coli strains
Maps of the mobilizing plasmid with the oriT sequence
(pT7hpGFP+oriT) and a control plasmid without the oriT
sequence (pT7hpGFP) are shown in Figure 4A. We used
the oriT sequence amplified from pRK290 (21) to construct
the mobilizing plasmid. In order to allow a double-stranded
hairpin-loop containing an active T7 promoter sequence to
form in mobilized ssDNA, we also added appropriately
designed inverted repeat sequences that include the T7 pro-
moter sequence (i.e. T7hp and PT7, Figure 4B) (27). Finally, to
minimize transcription from E.coli promoter sequences in
these plasmids, we flanked the T7hp promoter and GFP
assay sequence with the strong E.coli transcriptional termina-
tor sequences ltL3, ltI and rrnBt1t2 (24). The mobilizing and
control plasmids were transformed into the conjugative E.coli
strain S17-1 (20), and transformants were selected on LB-Tet
plates (12.5 mg/ml tetracycline).
In organello RNA synthesis in various mating buffers
In order for us to conduct these conjugation experiments, we
needed to find a suitable incubation buffer system that would
support both E.coli growth and in organello RNA synthesis
inside the mitochondria. We tested 11 buffers that combined
components of standard conjugation and in organello RNA
synthesis buffer systems (Table 1) for their ability to support
growth of an overnight E.coli culture and for their ability to
promote in organello RNA synthesis in isolated mitochondria
(Figure 5). In incubation buffer 11, E.coli did not grow but
good in organello RNA synthesis was observed (Figure 5, lane
11). In incubation buffers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8, poor levels of both
E.coli growth and in organello RNA syntheses were observed
(Figure 5, lanes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8). Addition of yeast extracts to
these buffers (incubation buffers 3, 6 and 9) significantly
improved E.coli growth and improved in organello RNA syn-
theses in two of them (Figure 5, lanes 3 and 9). Finally, we
tested standard LB medium (buffer 10) as the mating and in
organello RNA synthesis buffer and found both high level of
in organello RNA synthesis and the best E.coli growth of the
buffers tested (Figure 5, lane 10). Based on these results, we
decided to use LB as the mating buffer for our conjugation
experiment.
Transfer of exogenous DNA into mitochondria by
conjugation
Donor E.coli S17-1 cells harboring the mobilizing and the
control plasmids, respectively, were mixed with the
T7RNAP-containing mitochondria isolated from the LL/
2-T7mt cell line. To improve the mating efficiency and ensure
good contact between E.coli and mitochondria, we added 1%
low-melting point agarose to the mating mixture of E.coli and
T7RNAP-mitochondria to form a small agarose block, which
was agitated by shaking at 37C. After incubating for 5 h, we
added ampicillin (200 mg/ml) to the mating mixture to lyse the
E.coli cells and DNase I and RNase A (50 mg/ml) for 2 h at
37C to remove any DNA that had not been transferred into the
mitochondria and any RNA that may have been synthesized
outside of the mitochondria.
For control experiments, we used E.coli S17-1 harboring a
control plasmid that has no oriT sequence (pT7hpGFP,
Figure 4A) and performed mating with T7RNAP-
mitochondria with concurrent in organello RNA synthesis
(Figure 6, lanes 1 and 2). No signal was detected by RT–
PCR in these samples. We clearly see the expected RT–
PCR product (Figure 6, lane 4), however, in the conjugation
reactions between T7RNAP-mitochondria and E.coli S17-1
harboring a mobilizable plasmid that has the oriT sequence
(pT7hpGFPT+oriT, Figure 4A). No signal was detected in
the control reactions without reverse transcriptase (RT)
(Figure 6, lanes 1 and 3). We performed multiple repetitions
of this mating experiment to confirm that the procedure
described is reproducible and robust.
DISCUSSION
We have found that exogenous plasmid DNA can be trans-
ferred into the mitochondrial matrix by means of conjugation
between bacteria and mitochondria. Mitochondria arose from
an intracellular bacterial symbiont of the first ancestral eukary-
otic cells (29) and have both an inner and outer membrane that
are generally similar to many bacteria. Bacterial conjugative
transfer evolved to transfer DNA through this type of double
membrane, and so it is perhaps not surprising that this system
can transfer DNA constructs into mitochondria as well.
In order to determine if bacterial conjugation could serve
as an effective means of transforming mitochondria, we first

designed an assay to specifically detect DNA that was trans-
ferred into the matrix of structurally intact mitochondria
(Figure 1). In this assay, the transferred DNA is transcribed
by an RNA polymerase that is present only in the mitochon-
drial matrix and these transcripts are specifically detected by
RT–PCR. Any DNA or RNA outside of the mitochondria is
eliminated by specifically lysing the bacterial DNA donor and
adding high levels of DNase and RNase prior to in organello
RNA isolation. Although this assay could perhaps have been
performed by placing a mitochondrial promoter on the
mobilizable DNA construct and by relying on the endogenous
mitochondrial RNA polymerase to generate transcripts from
transferred DNA, we instead chose to use the robust and
well-characterized phage T7 transcription system for our
experiments.
T7RNAP is a single 100 kDa polypeptide that recognizes
a simple 18 nt promoter and has been widely used for both
in vivo and in vitro expression systems (27,28) and has been
shown to be transcriptionally active when introduced into
the mitochondrial matrix in yeast (30). We used the mitochon-
drial leader peptide of the mouse mitochondrial transcription

pT7hpGFP and pT7hpGFP+oriT, respectively. The T7hp sequence was cloned in front of the T7 promoter (PT7) and was designed to form a double-stranded
hairpin-loop T7 promoter after transferring the single-stranded plasmid DNA into the mitochondria by conjugation. Only the mobilizing plasmid contains the oriT
sequence. (B) A schematic representation for the formation of a double-stranded hairpin-loop T7 promoter. Once a DNA strand is transferred to T7RNAP-
mitochondria by conjugation, spontaneous annealing around the T7 promoter region in the ssDNA will form a fully duplexed T7 promoter inside the mitochondria.
T7RNAP can recognize this duplexed sequence (27,28) and initiate transcription of an RNA molecule (red characters).

Figure 5. In organello RNA syntheses in various incubation buffers using
isolated mouse mitochondria. The mitochondria were isolated from the mouse
LL/2 cell line and incubated in 11 modified incubation buffers (Table 1) with
10 mCi of [a-32P]UTP at 37C for 2 h by shaking. Total RNA was isolated from
the mitochondria and fractionated on a 1% of NorthernMax-Gly (Ambion,
Austin, TX) agarose gel at 5 V/cm. The gel was then dried and exposed directly
on an X-ray film.

factor A (TFAM) to target T7RNAP into the mitochondrial
network in mouse cells (Figure 2A). TFAM is encoded by a
nuclear gene and is imported into the mitochondrial matrix,
where it functions as a key regulator of mammalian mtDNA
transcription (31). We confirmed that the TFAM leader
sequence (TFAML) that we used for mitochondrial targeting
did in fact efficiently target exogenous proteins as expected by
fusing the GFP reading frame with that of TFAML and
confirming that the GFP was localized to the mitochondrial
network (Figure 2B). We also confirmed that the T7RNAP
was active inside the mitochondria by electroporating control
plasmids containing a T7 promoter into isolated T7RNAP-
containing mitochondrial fractions (Figure 3A and B). We
detected specific transcripts from electroporated DNA using
RT–PCR (Figure 3B, lane 4), but no transcripts were detected
when the DNA and mitochondria were mixed without
electroporation (Figure 3B, lane 2).
DNA that is transferred to the recipient cell by conjugation
is single stranded and is typically replicated back into dsDNA
using the replication machinery of the recipient cells (13).
However, because the replication of foreign DNA introduced
into isolated mitochondria has not yet been documented, we
did not want to make our assay system dependent on this
additional complex process. Instead, we designed and con-
structed a plasmid that will spontaneously form a double-
stranded hairpin structure containing a transcriptionally active
dsDNA T7 promoter sequence (27,28) even when the plasmid
is transferred as ssDNA into the mitochondria (Figure 4B).
The transcription assay using this construct, therefore, is a
direct indicator of transfer of the DNA construct into the
mitochondrial matrix containing the T7RNAP and is not
dependent on uncharacterized secondary events, such as
DNA replication.
To remove the E.coli after conjugative transfer of plasmid
DNA into mitochondria, we added ampicillin (200 mg/ml) to
the mating mixture to lyse the E.coli selectively. Beta-lactam
antibiotics, such as ampicillin, exert their bactericidal effects
by inhibiting the cross-linking step (transpeptidation) of bac-
terial cell wall biosynthesis, resulting in cell lysis (32). In
contrast, the mitochondria are not sensitive to ampicillin
and remain intact after the addition of this antibiotic. By
also adding RNase A and DNase I to the mating mixture,
we could eliminate any false background RT–PCR products
that might arise from RNA transcripts generated either in the
E.coli or outside of the mitochondria in the mating mixture.
The RNAs transcribed by the T7RNAP from the DNA
transferred into the mitochondrial matrix, on the other hand,
are protected from RNase A attack by intact mitochondrial
membranes.
We performed mating reactions between mitochondria and
E.coli with plasmid constructs that contain oriT transfer
sequences or, as a control, E.coli with plasmids that do not
have an oriT sequence (Figure 4). These latter reactions were
identical to the experimental samples in every way except for
the absence of the plasmid DNA sequences necessary to target
the plasmid for conjugative DNA transfer. These -oriT
reactions, therefore, serve as a control for all of the sources
of background RT–PCR signal that do not involve conjugative
transformation. As expected, these control reactions did not
generate a signal in this assay (Figure 6, lanes 1 and 2), indi-
cating that no DNA was transferred into the mitochondria in
the absence of conjugation and that the assay did not have a
detectable level of background. When identical conjugative
experiments were performed with plasmids that did contain
the oriT sequence, however, a robust signal was obtained
(Figure 6, lane 4).
Electroporation is the only practical method that has pre-
viously been shown to be capable of introducing DNA con-
structs into isolated mitochondria. The harsh experimental
conditions required for these transformations, however, appear
to irreversible damage the structural integrity of the mitochon-
dria and kill mammalian cells when applied to whole cells
rather than mitochondrial preparations (Y.G. Yoon, personal
observation). Bacterial conjugation, on the other hand, is a
relatively gentle procedure that does not affect the structural
integrity of the recipient mitochondria. This should allow
some in organello experiments to be performed that have
not been possible with electroporation. More importantly,
adapting conjugative DNA transfer to the transformation of
mitochondrial networks within living cells should also be pos-
sible. E.coli strains capable of invading and replicating within
the cytoplasm of mammalian cells are becoming increasingly
well characterized (33), and a conjugative, invasive strain of
E.coli would make an excellent tool for transferring DNA into
the mitochondrial networks of mammalian tissue culture cells.
We believe that conjugative transfer of DNA constructs into
mitochondria has important practical applications for both
applied and basic research. The ssDNA that is transferred
in the conjugation reaction would be an excellent substrate
for recombination into endogenous mitochondrial genomes,
both for the purposes of characterizing mitochondrial recomb-
ination systems and for potentially modifying those genomes.
Alternatively, complete mammalian mitochondrial genomes,
which we have previously shown can be cloned and modified
in E.coli (11), could be transferred into mitochondria via con-
jugation reactions. Although these genomes would initially be
introduced as ssDNA, the endogenous mtDNA replication
system may synthesize the second DNA strand from the ori-
gins of DNA replication present in the genome, much in the
same manner as typically occurs in bacterial conjugation. If
neither of the two-replication origins proves to be functional as

and T7RNAP-mitochondria. E.coli S17-1 harboring pT7hpGFP (lanes 1 and 2)
and pT7hpGFP+oriT (lanes 3 and 4), respectively, were used as the donors. All
mating samples were treated with 200 mg/ml of ampicillin, 200 U of DNase I
and 50 mg/ml of RNase A for 2 h at 37C after 5 h mating in an agarose block.
After isolating total RNA from the mating mixture, RT–PCR was carried out
using GFP-specific primers (see Materials and Methods). Expected band size of
the RT–PCR GFP products was 423 bp. Lane M, 1 kb plus DNA ladder (Life
Technologies). Control lanes (lanes 1 and 3) in which reverse transcriptase (RT)

purely ssDNA, it should be possible to engineer appropriate
hairpin sequences (e.g. see Figure 4B) to provide the required
dsDNA to initiate DNA synthesis.
