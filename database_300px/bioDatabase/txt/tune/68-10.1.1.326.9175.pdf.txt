The genetic relationships among 1,300 isolates of Escherichia coli representing 16 serotypes associated with
enteric disease, including 0157:H7 strains recovered from patients with hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic
uremic syndrome and 026:H11, 055:H6, 055:H7, 0111:H2, and 0128:H2 strains, many ofwhich were isolated
originally from infants with diarrhea, were estimated from allelic variation among 20 enzyme-encoding genes
detected by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Multiple electrophoretic types were observed among isolates of
each serotype, with isolates of the same 0 serogroup differing on average at 28% of the enzyme loci. Comparisons
of the multilocus enzyme profiles revealed that 72% of the isolates belong to 15 major electrophoretic types, each
ofwhich corresponds to a bacterial clone with a wide geographic distribution. Genetically, the 0157:H7 clone is
most closely related to a clone of 055:H7 strains that has long been associated with worldwide outbreaks of
infantile diarrhea. We propose that the new pathogen emerged when an 055:H7-like progenitor, already
possessing a mechanism for adherence to intestinal cells, acquired secondary virulence factors (Shiga-like
cytotoxins and plasmid-encoded adhesins) via horizontal transfer and recombination.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a newly
recognized class of enteric pathogen (10, 23, 48), was first
linked to a clinically distinct syndrome of diarrheal disease
called hemorrhagic colitis (HC) following two outbreaks of
HC in North America in 1982 (36). The EHEC strains
recovered from these outbreaks were serotype 0157:H7 and
did not possess the virulence determinants typical of other
E. coli that cause infectious enteric disease (36): they failed
to produce the classical toxins characteristic of enterotoxi-
genic E. coli (ETEC), lacked the invasive abilities of entero-
invasive E. coli, and were serotypically distinct from strains
that have long been associated with worldwide outbreaks of
infantile diarrhea, the enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC).
Recent studies have shown that 0157:H7 EHEC strains
express potent Shiga-like cytotoxins (30, 32), carry plasmids
that encode adhesins mediating bacterial adherence to intes-
tinal cells (19, 25), and have a chromosomal gene (eae locus)
that is essential for the production of intimin (11) and the
attaching and effacing lesions characteristic of some EPEC
strains (11, 17, 58). Illnesses caused by E. coli 0157:H7,
including HC and hemolytic uremic syndrome, as well as
diseases caused by other Shiga-like cytotoxin-producing
strains (also referred to as verocytotoxigenic E. coli), have
emerged as a major health problem in North America and
Europe (5, 10, 20, 27, 44).
To determine the genetic relationships of 0157:H7 strains
to other pathogenic forms of E. coli, we used multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis (39) to study the genetic diversity
and clonal relationships among 0157:H7 isolates and strains
of other serotypes implicated in diarrheal disease. By detect-
ing allelic variation at polymorphic enzyme loci, the multi-
locus approach provides a sensitive system of genetic mark-

ers for characterizing the chromosomal genotypes of strains
and for estimating the overall genomic relatedness of isolates
(39). Previously, we found that 0157:H7 isolates from recent
epidemics ofHC in North America were not closely allied to
Shiga-like cytotoxin-producing strains of other E. coli sero-
types (54), many of which produce a clinically similar form
of bloody diarrhea (49, 50). We also demonstrated that
0157:H7 strains are only distantly related to other strains of
the 0157 group associated with enteric infections in animals
(55). These findings suggested that if the 0157:H7 strains
have evolved recently from an extant E. coli lineage, strains
closely related to 0157:H7 strains would be found in an 0
serogroup other than 0157.
Here we assess the genetic relatedness among E. coli
isolates obtained from patients and animals in diverse local-
ities on five continents, with special emphasis on strains of
16 specific O:H serotypes that have been associated with
infectious diarrheal disease. We focused our study on strains
of the following serotypes, which generally have one or more
properties in common with 0157:H7 strains, as summarized
in Table 1: EHEC 026:H11 and 0111:H8, strains which may
produce Shiga-like cytotoxin and cause HC; EPEC 055:H6,
O111:H2, 0111:H12, O111:H21, 0128:H2, and 0128:H12,
strains which may attach to intestinal epithelial cells by a
mechanism similar to that of 0157:H7 strains; and EPEC
055:H7 and ETEC 0128:H7, bacteria which express H7
flagellar antigen. In addition, we examined isolates of several
other H types and nonmotile strains of the 026, 055, 0111,
0128, and 0157 serogroups.

humans, were characterized for allelic variation at 20 en-
zyme-encoding loci by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis
(39). Most of the isolates were obtained from the collections
of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC; Atlanta, Ga.), the
E. coli Reference Center (University Park, Pa.), and the
Statens Seruminstitut (Copenhagen, Denmark). The samples
were originally collected in the period from 1934 to 1991
from North America (Canada, Guatemala, Greenland, Ja-
maica, Mexico, Panama, and the United States), South
America (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Suriname, and Peru),
Africa (Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, and Zaire), Europe
(Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, England, France, Germany,
Sweden, Switzerland, and Wales), Asia (Afghanistan, Iran,
Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam),
and Australia. Additional isolates were kindly supplied by L.
Beutin, A. Cravioto, H. Lior, W. Maas, J. Mathewson, A.
O'Brien, and P. Tarr.
The sample set contains cultures studied previously by
multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, including 76 0157:H7
isolates originally obtained from patients with HC and he-
molytic uremic syndrome in North America (7, 54), 194 0157
strains of a variety of H types originally isolated from
domesticated animals with colibacillosis (55), and 24 EPEC
strains of serotypes 055:H6, 0111:H2, and 0128:H2, origi-
nally recovered from cases of infantile diarrhea (34).
For comparative purposes, we also included five 0-anti-
gen type strains that are used for the preparation of standard
0 antisera (34), as follows: H311b (026:H-), Su3912-41
(055:H-), Stoke W (0111:H-), Cigleris (0128:H2), and
A2 (0157:H19).
Enzyme electrophoresis. To analyze enzyme electro-
phoretic variation, extracts of water-soluble proteins from
disrupted cells were prepared and subjected to horizontal
starch gel electrophoresis and selective enzyme staining as
described previously (39). For each enzyme, electromorphs
(allozymes) were distinguished by differences in the migra-
tion rate of specifically stained protein bands. The 20 en-
zymes analyzed individually for mobility variants are listed
in Table 3. Electromorphs for each enzyme were determined
by comparison with standard mobility variants and assigned
numbers by their rate of anodal migration. Isolates that
lacked detectable enzyme activity were assigned a null
allelic state at the locus in question.
Electromorphs of an enzyme were equated with alleles at
the corresponding structural gene loci, so that each bacterial
strain was characterized by its multilocus genotype (allele
combination) for the enzyme-encoding loci assayed (39).
Distinctive multilocus genotypes were designated electro-
phoretic types (ETs), which were numbered by their inferred
relationships from a cluster analysis (see below).
Shiga-like toxin gene probes. Gene probes specific for slt-I
and slt-II were prepared by amplifying DNA by the poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR). For slt-I, template DNA for
the PCR was prepared from E. coli 3143-85B (54) and
amplified with primers 5'-TCGTATGGTGCTCAAGGA
GTA-3' and 5'-TCTGAGTCAACGAAAAATAA-3'. For
slt-II, DNA was prepared from strain 871717 and amplified
with primers 5'-TCAGCCAAAAGGAACACCTG-3' and
5'-CTGCACTTCAGCAAATCCGG-3'. The PCR products
were spin filtered and labeled with [a-32P]dCTP by nick
translation prior to hybridization, according to the procedure
of the manufacturer (GIBCO Laboratories, Grand Island,
N.Y.).
DNA hybridizations. Total chromosomal DNA from 50 ml
of overnight cultures was isolated by the protocol of Silhavy
et al. (43). For each isolate, 10 ,ug of DNA was immobilized
on a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe; Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, Calif.) with a vacuum apparatus by the alkaline
blotting protocol of the manufacturer (Bio-Dot; Bio-Rad),
cross-linked on a transilluminator for 1 min, and baked at
80Â°C for 30 min.
Hybridizations were performed by the standard protocol
for Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad) with bottles (300 by 35
mm) in a mini-hybridization oven (Hybaid; National Labnet
Co., Woodbridge, N.J.). Membranes were prehybridized at
62Â°C for 30 min in 15 ml of heated prehybridization solution.
The prehybridization solution was removed, replaced with
15 ml of heated hybridization solution containing 0.75 ,ug of
labeled probe DNA per ml, and incubated at 62Â°C with
rotation for 20 to 24 h. Membranes were washed twice with
80 to 100 ml of 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and twice
with 1% SDS. Washes were performed in rotating bottles at
62Â°C for 30 min. Membranes were sealed into plastic bags
and exposed to X-ray film overnight at -70Â°C.
Autoradiographs were scored for the amount of exposure
for DNA from the negative (strain K-12) and positive (slt-I,
3143-85B; slt-IH, 871717) controls that were included on
every membrane. Each bacterial isolate was tested on at
least two filters for each gene probe.
Phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic relationships
among ETs were inferred by distance methods (12) with the
average-linkage (AL) method (45). For the analysis, a matrix
of genetic distances between all pairs of ETs was computed
from comparisons of electrophoretic profiles. Distance (d)
was calculated as d.- = -In (1 - D), where D equals the
proportion of loci with different alleles between the ith and
jth ETs (15, 29). The principle underlying this formula is that
any allelic difference in electrophoretic mobility results from
at least one codon difference at the nucleotide level, and
under the assumption that codon changes occur indepen-

dently, d gives an estimate of the mean number of electro-
phoretically detectable codon differences per genetic locus
(29). Using the AL algorithm (45), we constructed dendro-
grams which summarize the genetic relationships among
ETs and are a source of hypotheses about the history of
phylogenetic divergence of strains.
To assess the size of the error involved in the inferred
genetic relationships among ETs, a bootstrap method was
used to create a series of random samples from the original
data (13). A computer program (ETBOOT) was designed
that samples enzyme loci with replacement from the original
data to generate new genotypic profiles for the original ETs,
calculates a genetic distance matrix, and constructs a tree
(dendrogram). This process was repeated for 1,000 phyloge-
netic trees, and the frequency of occurrence of different
clusters in these trees was tabulated. For particular clusters
of interest, the percentage of bootstrapped trees with the
same nodes of the observed tree were recorded.
The bootstrap approach of repeated sampling from the
original data provided a method for obtaining confidence
limits on clusters in dendrograms. In addition to the AL
algorithm, we also used the neighbor-joining (NJ) method
(37) for comparison in the bootstrap analysis. The NJ
method has been shown in computer simulations to work
better than the AL method in recovering a phylogeny when
the rate of divergence varies across lineages (18).
RESULTS
Genetic diversity within serotypes. The analysis of protein
polymorphisms among 1,300 E. coli isolates of five sero-
groups revealed extensive genetic variation in the structural
genes encoding soluble enzymes; all 20 enzymes had elec-
trophoretically detectable mobility variants, with an average
of 8.5 alleles per enzyme locus (Table 2). Within each of the
16 O:H serotypes associated with diarrheal disease, there
were multiple ETs, with the number of ETs ranging from 2
(0111:H8 and 0128:H7 strains) to 16 (055:NM strains)
(Table 2). For the 15 serotypes other than 0157:H7, there is
a significant linear relationship between the number of ETs
and the number of isolates (Fig. 1). Essentially, this corre-
lation means that, for isolates of the same serotype, a new
ET is found for each six strains examined-at least for
sample sizes of fewer than 100 isolates. Among the 369
0157:H7 strains, however, only six ETs were resolved,
which reflects the low level of genetic variation among
strains of this serotype. In contrast to the effect of sample
size on the number of ETs of a serotype, the average genetic
diversity per locus (H) is not correlated with sample size,
regardless of whether it is calculated for isolates (HI) or ETs
(HET)-
026 strains. Among the 93 isolates of the 026 serogroup,
there were 20 ETs which differed, on average, at 38% (HET
= 0.382) of the enzyme loci (Table 2). The 47 isolates of
EHEC serotype 026:H11 represented a total of six ETs,
although most isolates belong to one of two closely related
ETs. The genetic diversity among isolates of this serotype
(HI = 0.069) accounts for 33% of the genetic diversity among
isolates of the 026 group as a whole (Table 2).
Genetic relationships among the 20 ETs of the 026 sero-
group, inferred from cluster analysis by the AL method (Fig.
2A) and the NJ algorithm (not shown), revealed two major
groups of strains: the top cluster includes ETs 1 to 8 and was
observed in 88% of the bootstrapped AL trees (92% of the
NJ trees), and the bottom cluster of ETs 9 to 17 was

major clusters differ in the frequency of two flagellar antigen
types; most isolates in the top cluster have H32 flagellar
antigen, whereas a majority of the strains in the bottom
cluster have Hll antigen. The association between cluster
and H type is not complete, because an 026:H11 strain (ET
7) also occurs in the top cluster (Fig. 2A). The two ETs most
frequently isolated, ET 13 and ET 15, are closely related and

055 strains. We examined nearly equal numbers of the
three EPEC serotypes among 298 055 strains: 20% of the
isolates were 055:H6, 27% were 055:H7, and 23% were
nonmotile (Table 2). Among the 055:H6 and 055:H7 strains,
we identified 12 and 14 ETs, respectively, with the diversity
among isolates within serotypes accounting for 49% (055:
H6) and 33% (055:H7) of the total diversity among isolates
of the 055 serogroup (HI = 0.376). The nonmotile 055
strains were more variable than either the H6 or H7 strains,
with a diversity among isolates that is 72% of that for the

total of 57 ETs which differed, on average, at 45% (HET =
0.451) of the enzyme loci (Table 2). Twenty-five of the ETs
(43%) were represented by more than one isolate. The two
most frequently isolated ETs fell into two distinct clusters
that were observed in a majority of the bootstrapped trees
(Fig. 2B). The top cluster in Fig. 2B comprises ETs 1 to 11
and was found in 71% of the AL trees (86% of the NJ trees).
This cluster includes the second most common multilocus
genotype (ET 5) in the 055 serogroup, which is represented
by 53 isolates, mostly of serotype 055:H6. The second
cluster of 11 ETs (ETs 12 to 22), which was observed in 90%
of both the AL and NJ trees, contains the most frequently
isolated enzyme genotype (ET 15), which was represented
by 117 isolates, most of which were either 055:H7 or
055:NM. Together, the 22 ETs of these two clusters account
for 71% of the isolates of the 055 serogroup. Although H6
and H7 are the predominant serotypes in the two clusters, it
is noteworthy that isolates with these H antigens are found
throughout the dendrogram, reflecting the substantial ge-
netic diversity (HET) among ETs of these serotypes (Table 2)
and indicating that these antigens can be expressed by
strains with very different chromosomal backgrounds.
0111 strains. More than half of the 203 isolates of the 0111
serogroup examined belonged to EPEC serotype H2, H12,
H21, or NM (Table 2). The average H1 for the 0111 strains
with H2, H8, H12, or H21 antigen was 0.103, which is about
one-third of the total diversity among all isolates of the
serogroup. In contrast, the average HET for the four sero-
types was 80% of the diversity for the 0111 serogroup. The
difference between the estimates of diversity reflects the fact
that most of the isolates of a serotype are of a single ET. The
nonmotile 0111 strains were more diverse genetically (H,, =
0.198) than isolates of other 0111 H types. Although there
were multiple ETs among isolates of each serotype, there
was, in general, a relatively low level of genetic variation
among isolates with specific H types.
The most common enzyme genotype (ET 20) in the 0111
serogroup is represented by 65 isolates and occurs in a
cluster of four ETs (Fig. 2C). This cluster (ETs 20 to 23),
which was recovered in 52% of the AL trees (42% of the NJ
trees), includes 43% of the isolates of the 0111 serogroup,
most of which are EPEC serotype 0111:H2. The second
most common enzyme genotype, ET 8, belongs to a tight
cluster (ETs 7 to 10) that was observed in 79% of the AL
trees (85% of the NJ trees). A majority of the strains of this
cluster are EHEC serotype 0111:H8. Of the remaining
EPEC serotypes, 0111:H12 and 0111:H21 strains largely
fall into ET 2 and ET 16, respectively, although isolates of
these serotypes also occur in other branches of the dendro-
gram (Fig. 2C). For example, an isolate with H21 antigen
(ET 36) is highly divergent from other H21 strains and differs
by 10 alleles from its closest relative at the bottom of the
dendrogram, again indicating that the same O:H serotype
can be associated with distantly related strains.
0128 strains. There were 11 ETs among the 40 0128:H2
EPEC strains, which accounted for 50% of the genetic
diversity among strains of the 0128 group (Table 2). The 19
0128:H7 ETEC strains were nearly identical in electro-
phoretic profile and were classified into two closely related
ETs. The 5 ETs with ETEC serotype 0128:H12 were
genetically diverse, as reflected by the H, and HET values,
both of which exceeded 0.20. The nonmotile 0128 strains
separated into three highly divergent ETs; the genetic diver-
sity among these isolates exceeded that of the serogroup as
a whole.
The 35 ETs identified among the 0128 strains were orga-
nized into three major clusters (Fig. 2D). Strains with H12
flagellar antigen occur exclusively in the top cluster (ETs 1 to
8), which was found in only 16% of the AL trees (48% of the
NJ trees). ET 8 was the most common 0128:H12 serotype
and was represented by seven isolates. Six 0128:H8 strains
of four closely related ETs formed a second cluster (ETs 9 to
12) recovered in 82% of the AL trees (81% of the NJ trees).
With the exception of ET 35, the remaining isolates of the
0128 serogroup belong in the large cluster of 22 ETs, within
which no consensus order of branching or significant group-
ings resulted from the bootstrap analysis. The most common
ETs are as follows: ET 16, which represents 19 0128:H7
strains; ET 21, which includes 10 0128:H21 strains; and ETs
29 to 31, which together represent 30 0128:H2 strains.
Interestingly, the H2 flagellar antigen was found in 0128
strains of diverse genetic backgrounds.
0157 strains. The occurrence of extensive genetic varia-
tion among 0157 strains is reflected in the following obser-
vations (Table 2). All 20 enzymes assayed were polymor-
phic, with an average of 5.3 alleles per enzyme locus; the
mean genetic diversity per locus among isolates (H,) was
0.275, indicating that 0157 strains have different alleles, on
average, at 28% of the enzyme loci; and there are 50 ETs
which differ, on average, at 45% of their enzyme loci (HET =
0.445).
Only 3% (0.008/0.275) of the genetic diversity of the 0157
serogroup is accounted for by variation among strains with
the H7 flagellar antigen (Table 2). Most of the 0157:H7
isolates (95%) belong to a single ET, designated ET 11, and
the electrophoretic profiles of the closely related variant
strains differ only by single alleles from that of ET 11 (Fig.
3). The tight cluster of 0157:H7 strains was frequently
recovered in the bootstrap analysis (93% of the AL trees and
91% of the NJ trees) and is highly divergent (d = 0.67) from
the remaining clusters of the 0157 serogroup. The other
major cluster, accounting for a large proportion of the 0157
isolates, is composed of three ETs (ETs 15 to 17) and was
observed in the majority of the bootstrapped trees (92% of
the AL trees and 88% of the NJ trees). There were 142
isolates of ET 16, the most frequently recovered enzyme
genotype of this cluster. Most of the isolates of this ET
(previously referred to as ET 14 in reference 55) were
originally collected from cases of porcine colibacillosis,
express K88 fimbriae, and carry H43 flagellar antigen (55).
Most frequently isolated ETs. Although the strains of 16
serotypes associated with outbreaks of diarrheal disease
represent a large variety of chromosomal genotypes, as
reflected in the numerous ETs of each serotype, the com-
parison of electrophoretic profiles revealed common ETs
that together accounted for a majority of the isolates of each
serogroup. Table 3 presents the allele profiles of the 15 most
frequently recovered ETs, which generally are genetically
distant from one another, differing on average at 55% of the
20 enzyme loci. Together, these 15 ETs, which represent 8%
of a total of 191 ETs resolved in the combined data (Table 2),
account for more than 70% of all the isolates examined here.
Because most of the strains of these ETs were originally
recovered from patients with diarrheal disease in widely
separated geographic areas, we infer that they individually
mark widespread clones, which we will refer to as diarrhe-
agenic E. coli (DEC) clones. The serotypic characteristics of
the isolates of the DEC clones are listed in Table 4.
Examination of the allele profiles presented in Table 3
discloses several close genetic relationships of DEC clones
of different serotypes and disease classes. For example,
there is only a single allele difference in multilocus genotype

FIG. 3. Genetic relationships of multilocus enzyme genotypes
(ETs) of E. coli strains of the 0157 serogroup. The dendrogram was

genetic distances between multilocus genotypes. The predominant

between DEC 3 and DEC 4, representing the 0157:H7
clones, and DEC 5, the major 055:H7 clone (Table 3). This
similarity in electrophoretic profile indicates an overall close
relatedness in the genomes of these strains. These ETs are
very distinct from those of the other common clones, differ-
ing at nine enzyme loci from DEC 6, the most similar DEC
clone, isolates of which can differ in serotype but are usually
O111:H12 (Table 4).
Other close genetic relationships among the major clones
include DEC 8, 9, and 10, which show single-allele differ-
ences at the glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and
gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase loci but otherwise
have the same alleles at 18 of the enzyme loci (Table 3). The
strains of these clones are typically 026:H11 or O111:H8,
although some other serotypes are occasionally encountered
(Table 4). There is also a close relationship between DEC 11
and 12 strains (Table 3), all of which express H2 flagellar
antigen but have either 0111 or 0128 somatic antigen (Table
4).
0 standard strains. In four of the five cases examined, the
standard strain for an 0 antigen belonged to a common ET of
a serogroup. Comparison of the allele profiles showed that
H311b (026:H-) matched DEC 10, Stoke W (O111:H-)
matched DEC 12, Cigleris (0128:H2) matched DEC 11,
and A2 (0157:H19) matched DEC 7. The exception was
Su3912-41 of the 055 serogroup, a strain originally isolated
from human pus (40). This strain was ET 42 among the 055
strains (Fig. 2B) and was only distantly related to the
clusters containing the common diarrheagenic 055 ETs.
si genes. Our finding that 0157:H7 strains, which charac-
teristically carry slt genes and produce one or two Shiga-like
cytotoxins (2, 16, 31), belong to a distinct cluster in which
the common ETs (DEC 3 and 4) are 95% similar in enzyme
allele profile to the common 055:H7 ET (DEC 5), suggesting
that these 055 strains also harbor slt genes. To test this idea,
we extracted and purified total DNA from 93 DEC 5 isolates
and 54 DEC 4 (0157:H7) isolates and tested for the presence
of slt genes by dot-blot analysis. Hybridization with specific
gene probes for slt-I and slt-II synthesized by PCR revealed
that none of the DEC 5 isolates was positive for the slt genes,
whereas all 0157:H7 isolates were positive for at least one of
the slt genes. These results indicate that, in contrast to
wild-type 0157:H7 strains, the 055 strains of the DEC 5
clonal lineage do not carry either slt-I or slt-II.
DISCUSSION
The subdivision of E. coli strains associated with diarrheal
disease into categories based on distinct clinical features,
discrete virulence and adherence properties, and into vari-
ous O:H serotypes has been a useful and convenient system
for studying the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these
enteric disease agents (23). However, because many sero-
types of E. coli are genetically heterogenous (1, 3, 8, 34, 38,
40, 55, 57), the identification and classification of pathogenic
strains from epidemiological surveys based solely on O:H
serotyping are not always indicative of genetic relatedness.
Here, we have shown that the number of distinct multilocus
genotypes observed within a collection of strains of a single
serotype increases with sample size and that, consequently,
sample sizes of several hundred isolates may be required to
see the full extent of genotypic variation. Average genetic
diversity, or the proportion of loci with different alleles
between pairs of isolates, typically falls between 0.10 and
0.20 for strains of the same O:H serotype and between 0.30
and 0.40 for strains of the same 0 serogroup. Nonmotile
isolates of an 0 serogroup are more variable than those of
the same H type.
Evolutionary radiation of the major DEC clones. Although
our analysis of strains has shown substantial genotypic
variation among isolates of a serotype, the comparison of
electrophoretic profiles revealed common ETs that together
account for a majority of the isolates of each serogroup.
Because isolates of identical enzyme genotype were origi-
nally recovered at different times from patients in separate
geographic areas, we infer that these multilocus genotypes
distinguish pathogenic clones of wide geographic distribu-

tions. Thus, as observed in other genetically variable patho-
genic species of bacteria (41), the majority of the outbreaks
and sporadic cases of diarrheal disease are caused by a small
proportion of the total number of extant E. coli clones.
To elucidate the history and origin of the major DEC
clones, we have further characterized five isolates of each
DEC clone for allelic variation at an additional 13 enzyme
loci (56) and used the NJ method to derive a phylogenetic
tree (Fig. 4). The tree represents a phylogeny that predicts a
pattern of ancestry and levels of genomic divergence among
clones. Such clonal phylogenies serve as hypotheses that
can be tested by examining genetic variation at additional
loci. Hypothetical phylogenies also provide a framework for
drawing inferences about past horizontal gene transfer and
recombination events. In general, the rate of recombination
in natural populations of E. coli appears to be low (51-53);
however, individual genes, such as gnd (4), may have
obscured the histories because they have experienced high
rates of intragenic recombination.
The clonal phylogeny (Fig. 4) suggests the following
features concerning the evolutionary radiation of the DEC
clones. First, the genetic distances along major branches of
the tree reflect substantial levels of genetic divergence
between the chromosomal genomes. Here, branch lengths
are measured in terms of genetic distance, which, for elec-
trophoretically detected protein polymorphisms, estimates
the net number of detectable codon differences per enzyme
locus (29). From the observed accumulation of nucleotide
substitutions that result in charged amino acid replacements
among genes sequenced in E. coli K-12 and Salmonella
typhimunum LT-2, Whittam and Ake (51) estimated a mu-
tation rate per locus of 3.2 x 10-8 per year. (The calculation

FIG. 4. Phylogenetic tree inferred from allelic variation for 33
enzyme loci (56) for 15 common ETs associated with diarrhea. The
tree was constructed by the NJ method (37). Distance is defined as
the net number of detectable codon differences per locus. The
numbers of isolates (n) and serotypes of each clone are given in the
right-hand columns. The 13 enzymes examined in addition to the 20
listed in Table 3 are hexokinase, propanediol dehydrogenase, form-
aldehyde dehydrogenase, leucine aminopeptidase, diaphorase, glyc-
erate dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase 1 and 2, phosphoglu-
comutase, glutamine synthetase, peroxidase, glycerol kinase, and
tyrosine aminotransferase.
assumes that protein electrophoresis detects all codon
changes between alleles that involve charged amino acids in
the protein.) At this rate, a genetic distance of 0.10 (net
number of detectable codon differences per locus) is ex-
pected to accumulate along a branch of the tree, on average,
in 3.2 million years. Hence, the length of time back to a
common ancestor for the DEC clones is on the order of 10 to
15 million years, indicating that there has been sufficient time
for DEC clones to accumulate many differences in the genes
involved in pathogenesis. Second, clones of the same dis-
ease category are not monophyletic; that is, strains of the
same disease class (e.g., EHEC) are not restricted to a single
branch of the tree. This observation is not surprising, given
that many of the factors implicated in virulence and used to
define disease classes are encoded on plasmids or carried by
bacteriophages (23, 24, 47). Finally, the tree predicts that
clones of certain different disease categories or serotypes are
genomically closely related; for example, EPEC DEC 5
(O55:H7) lies in the same lineage as EHEC DEC 3 and 4
(0157:H7), and ETEC DEC 13 (0128:H7) is closely related
to EPEC clones DEC 14 (0128:H21) and DEC 15 (0111:
H21). Such close genetic relationships among clones of a
lineage suggest that these strains have in common traits
involved in pathogenesis.
Virulence properties of DEC clones. Representative strains
of several of the DEC clones described here have been
examined for virulence factors in previous studies (28, 34).
Because isolates of the same ET or clone are very closely
related, as indicated by the identity in electrophoretic pro-
file, we expect that certain properties, especially those
encoded by chromosomal genes, will be virtually uniform in
all members of a clone. (Indeed, Bohm and Karch [6] have
demonstrated that epidemiologically unrelated isolates of
0157:H7 were virtually indistinguishable in DNA fragments
resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.) In contrast, the
virulence traits encoded by plasmids or associated with
bacteriophages may be more variable among independent
isolates of a clone because of loss of these genetic elements
in nature or during laboratory culture.
Two distinct complexes of clones have the localized
pattern of HEp-2 cell adherence (9) that defines class I EPEC
(23). The first complex, which includes DEC 1 and DEC 2, is
part of a cluster of ETs composed of strains with the classic
EPEC serotypes 055:H6, 0125:H6, and 0142:H6 (34).
These clones were previously referred to as ET 4 and 5 (34),
based on the analysis of isolates from infantile diarrhea that
were shown to have the EPEC adherence factor (EAF) and
localized adherence (LA) to HEp-2 cells (41). Similar prop-
erties (EAF+ and LA') were described by Moyenuddin and
colleagues (28) for two isolates of DEC 2 (CDC strain
numbers 607-54 and 5513-56) that were originally recovered
from outbreaks of diarrheal illness in the United States.
They showed also that neither of these strains was positive
for Shiga-like toxin, as measured by a Vero cell assay and
DNA probes, and none was probe positive for E. coli
heat-labile or heat-stable enterotoxins (28). The second
complex includes DEC 11 and DEC 12, which belong to the
cluster (ETs 12 to 19; see Fig. 2 in reference 34) comprising
several EPEC serotypes with H2 antigen (34). In addition to
the five isolates examined by 0rskov and coworkers (34),
DEC 12 includes six 0111 strains isolated from U.S. out-
breaks of infantile diarrhea in the 1950s (CDC numbers
806-50, 2956-53, 4874-54, 124-55, 380-56, and 1852-59; see
Table 1 in reference 28), all of which were EAF+. These
strains also did not produce verotoxin or carry gene se-
quences for Shiga-like toxin, or E. coli heat-labile or heat-
stable enterotoxins (28).
Although these two complexes apparently have in com-
mon the EAF+ and concomitant LA' phenotypes and both
lack cytotoxin and enterotoxin genes, they are only distantly
related (Fig. 4).
Reconstructing the origin of the 0157:H7 clone complex.
Our analysis has shown that the 0157:H7 (DEC 4) clone,
associated with outbreaks of HC and hemolytic uremic
syndrome, and the major 055:H7 (DEC 5) clone, which is
associated with infantile diarrhea, are similar genetically and
thus were recently derived from a common ancestral cell.
From the close relationship between the genomes of these
distinct pathogens, as reflected by the 95% identity in
multilocus enzyme genotype, we would expect that these
clones also have many common genetic attributes, including
virulence factors, inherited from their most recent ancestor.
Hence, it is noteworthy that both 055:H7 (26) and 0157:H7
(56) attach intimately to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial
cells in the initial stages of infection, efface the microvilli,
and induce characteristic histological and ultrastructural
lesions in animal models (26, 50). Knutton et al. (21) have
shown that these attaching and effacing lesions are com-
posed of dense concentrations of actin microfilaments in the
apical cytoplasm beneath the attached bacteria and have
demonstrated that both 055:H7 and 0157:H7 strains pro-
duce similar lesions in human tissue cultures. Furthermore,
the production of attaching and effacing lesions requires
neither plasmid-encoded products nor expression of cyto-
toxins (21, 49), and the mechanism is determined, in part, by
the chromosomal eae gene (17), which presumably was
present in the most recent ancestor of the 055:H7 and
0157:H7 strains.
We propose a two-step scenario for the evolution of the
0157:H7 clone. First, an ancestral E. coli evolved the
chromosomally encoded gene products that mediate attach-
ing and effacing adherence. This attribute alone may be
sufficient for bacteria to cause diarrheal disease in infants, as

is the case with the contemporary 055:H7 clone. Second, an
O55:H7-like progenitor cell, already able to cause disease by
the attaching-effacing mechanism, acquired secondary viru-
lence factors, such as the genes encoding Shiga-like toxins
and adhesins, via horizontal genetic transfer from other
strains. With these genes expressed in the attaching-effacing
chromosomal background, a new pathogen causing a new
type of disease emerged-the 0157:H7 clone.
One prediction of the above scenario is that the 055:H7
lineage (DEC 5) should have an allele of the eae gene that is
very similar in sequence to that of the 0157:H7 lineage. Yu
and Kaper (58) have shown that there is 86% similarity in
nucleotide sequence at the eae locus between 0157:H7 and
a derivative of EPEC strain E2348/69 (0127, EAF+). How-
ever, strain E2348/69 is only distantly related to the O55:H7/
0157:H7 lineage, with different electrophoretic alleles at
about 50% of the enzyme loci (56). If the eae gene has
diverged along with the rest of the chromosomal back-
grounds of these strains, we predict that the close genetic
relationship of the O55:H7 and 0157:H7 clones should be
reflected in the relative divergence of their eae alleles, which
should be at most 1 to 2% different. These alleles, however,
could show greater levels of differentiation if, for example,
natural selection has favored certain amino acid replace-
ments in intimin molecules or if intragenic recombination has
generated novel mosaic alleles (4, 51).
The hypothesis that the 0157:H7 clone originated from an
055:H7-like ancestor through horizontal transfer and recom-
bination also gains support from the observation that both
Shiga-like toxins, encoded by prophage, and EPEC-associ-
ated adhesins, encoded on plasmids, occur in diverse lin-
eages of the E. coli population (32); presumably, these genes
can be transferred between strains in nature. Using specific
gene probes for the Shiga-like toxins, we found that none of
the 055 isolates examined here harbored slt sequences, a
result suggesting that the recent ancestor of the 0157:H7 and
055:H7 clones did not produce these cytotoxins. The pat-
tern of codon usage in the slt genes differs from that of most
E. coli protein-coding genes (16); indeed, the codon adapta-
tion index (42), a measure of the degree of synonymous
codon usage bias, for slt genes falls below the values
reported for 165 E. coli genes (42). Such a low degree of
codon adaptation strongly argues that the slt genes are
foreign to E. coli and were relatively recently acquired via
horizontal transfer.
Conclusions. In sum, E. coli strains that cause infectious
diarrhea belong to a small number of geographically wide-
spread clones. Phylogenetic analysis based on variation in
multilocus enzyme genotype demonstrates that the 0157:H7
clone is closely related to a group of 055 strains implicated
in infantile diarrhea, a result suggesting that this new patho-
gen was recently derived from an 055:H7-like ancestral
clone by addition of Shiga-like toxins and adhesin genes to a
genome already adapted for causing diarrheal disease. These
findings underscore the complex and multifactorial nature of
microbial pathogenesis (14), in which the acquisition and
expression of multiple virulence factors by strains with
specific chromosomal backgrounds may foster the emer-
gence of new pathogenic clones.
