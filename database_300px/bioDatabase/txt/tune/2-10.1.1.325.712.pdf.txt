Abstract
The microarray analysis of total cellular RNA is a common
method used in the evaluation of radiation-induced gene
expression. However, profiling the cellular transcriptome does
not take into account posttranscriptional processes that affect
gene expression. To better define the genes whose expression
is influenced by ionizing radiation, we used polysome-bound
RNA to generate gene translation profiles for a series of tumor
and normal cell lines. Cell lines were exposed to 2 Gy,
polysome-bound RNA isolated 6 hours later, and then
subjected to microarray analysis. To identify the genes whose
translation was affected by radiation, the polysome-bound
RNA profiles were compared with their corresponding con-
trols using significance analysis of microarrays (<1% false
discovery rate). From the statistically significant genes
identified for each cell line, hierarchical clustering was
performed by average linkage measurement and Pearson’s
correlation metric. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for
distributing genes into biological networks and for evaluation
of functional significance. Radiation-induced gene translation
profiles clustered according to tissue of origin; the cell lines
corresponding to each tissue type contained a significant
number of commonly affected genes. Network analyses
suggested that the biological functions associated with the
genes whose translation was affected by radiation were tumor
type–specific. There was also a set of genes/networks that
were unique to tumor or normal cells. These results indicate
that radiation-induced gene translation profiles provide a
unique data set for the analysis of cellular radioresponse and
suggest a framework for identifying and targeting differences
in the regulation of tumor and normal cell radiosensitivity.

Introduction
Radiotherapy continues to be a primary treatment modality for
most solid tumors. Recent approaches aimed at improving the
efficacy of radiation involve the development and application of
molecularly targeted agents, a strategy that requires a thorough
understanding of the fundamental processes comprising cellular
radioresponse. Towards this end, the modulation of gene
expression has long been assumed to play a regulatory role in a
cell’s response to radiation, and thus, to provide a source of
potential targets for radiation modifiers. Over the last several years,
the microarray analysis of total cellular RNA has been applied
extensively as a means of providing a genome-wide perspective of
radiation-induced changes in gene expression. Although such
analyses have been reported for a variety of irradiated tumor and
normal cell lines, the profiles generated have revealed few
commonly affected genes, even among cell lines originating from
the same histology (1–4). Moreover, although these microarray
analyses accurately reflect changes at the mRNA level, there has
been an overall lack of data correlating radiation-induced changes
in mRNAs with their corresponding proteins. Although there are
exceptions involving individual genes (5), the vast majority of
mRNA changes detected after irradiation have not been extended
to the protein level. Along these lines, in a direct comparison of
radiation-induced proteins with their corresponding mRNAs,
Szkanderova´ et al. reported no correlation for the 10 proteins
evaluated (6). Given that protein is the operational end product of
gene expression, the lack of correlation between mRNA and protein
changes combined with the heterogeneity among cell lines has
made it difficult to assign a functional significance to radiation-
induced gene expression.
Profiling the cellular transcriptome, the traditional microarray
approach, does not take into account posttranscriptional processes
that contribute to the regulation of gene expression. It is well
established that posttranscriptional events such as mRNA splicing,
nuclear export, stabilization, and translation initiation provide an
infrastructure for regulating gene expression, a process that can
function independent of transcription. For example, in eukaryotic
cells exposed to a number of types of stress, changes in mRNA
levels do not correlate with protein production (7–10). Accounting
for the discrepancy between the transcriptome and proteome is
translational control (11–13), which has also been shown to play
a significant role in regulating gene expression during such
fundamental processes as embryogenesis (14), gliomagenesis (15),
and T-cell activation (16). It should also be noted that in a recent
analysis of the NCI-60 cell lines, at best, a 65% agreement was
found between transcript and protein expression profiles under
basal growth conditions (17).
Thus, to better understand the effects of radiation on gene
expression, it will be necessary to take into account posttranscrip-
tional regulation, i.e., translational control. Because one of the final
steps in gene translation is the loading of a mRNA onto polysomes,
we have begun to focus on the microarray analysis of polysome-
bound RNA (3). In contrast with total cellular RNA or mRNA
(traditional microarray analysis), this procedure bypasses the post-
transcriptional infrastructure to generate profiles of mRNAs that
are undergoing translation, which significantly reduces the dis-
crepancy between the transcriptome and the proteome (16, 18, 19).
We initially applied this microarray approach to human glioma cell
lines irradiated with 7 Gy (3). The data generated showed that the
number of genes whose translational activity was modified by

radiation was approximately 10-fold greater than those whose
transcription was affected. Moreover, this study showed that, in
contrast with the radiation-induced transcriptome, there is a
correlation between the genes whose translational activity was
affected and the expression of their corresponding proteins. These
results suggested that defining gene translation profiles might
provide a novel perspective of radiation-induced regulation of gene
expression. Therefore, to extend our initial findings to other cell
types and to a clinically relevant dose, we have now used polysome-
bound RNA to generate gene translation profiles for 18 human cell
lines after exposure to 2 Gy.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and treatment. The human tumor cell lines used in this
study included five gliomas (U87, U251, SF126, SF539, SF295), four
pancreatic carcinomas (ASPC1, BxPC3, MiaPaca, PANC1), three breast
carcinomas (MDA-MB-231, MCF7, T47D), and two non–small cell lung
carcinomas (HOP62, A549). The normal human cell lines evaluated were
BJ (skin fibroblast), MRC5 and MRC9 (lung fibroblasts), and MEC
(mammary epithelial cells). Cell lines were obtained from the National
Cancer Institute, Developmental Therapeutics Program repository or
American Type Culture Collection with the exception of the mammary
epithelial cell line, which was purchased from Cambrex BioScience, Inc.
Cells were grown in either DMEM or RPMI medium as suggested from
the source, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and glutamate
(5 mmol/L). Cell cultures were maintained at 37jC and 5% CO2. Cultures
were irradiated using a Pantak X-ray source at a dose rate of 1.55 Gy/min.
Cell lines were exposed to 2 Gy or sham-irradiated, polysome-bound RNA
was isolated 6 h later and subjected to microarray analysis. Each cell line
was evaluated in biological replicates.
Polysome RNA preparation and microarray hybridization. Polysome
preparation and probe labeling were performed as described (3). Polysome-
bound samples from sucrose-gradient fractions were pooled and subjected
to microarray analysis. Experimental RNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP and
reference RNA (Stratagene Universal Reference) was labeled with Cy5-dUTP.
Each microarray chip contained 7,680 human cDNA clones (National
Cancer Institute, ROSP 8K Human Array), and methods for microarray
hybridization and washing were done as previously described (20).

genes whose translational activities were

were irradiated (2 Gy) and polysome-bound
RNA collected 6 h later. To identify genes
whose translation was either up-regulated or
down-regulated by radiation, biological replicates
were averaged for each cell line and compared
with the polysome-bound RNA profiles generated
from their corresponding control (unirradiated)
cells using SAM (<1% FDR). Those genes
were then used to derive unsupervised
cluster maps using average linkage distance
measurement and Pearson’s correlation metric.

Hybridized arrays were scanned with GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon
Instruments, Inc.) at wavelengths of 635 and 532 nm for Cy5- and Cy3-
labeled probes, respectively. The resulting TIFF images were analyzed with
GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments). The images and raw intensity
data were stored at mAdb tools (Center for Information Technology, NIH).6
The microarray data have been deposited in National Center for
Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no.
GSE10547).7
Statistical analysis filtering and clustering. Preliminary filtering of raw
data was performed using mAdb tools with the following setting. All flagged
spots were treated as missing values and the data were subjected to spot
quality filter with signal to background ratios of >2, a minimum background-
corrected signal of 250 counts, and 60% of pixels in the spots with an
intensity greater than a SD plus background. Further data analysis was
carried out using R software package (R Development Core Team, 2005)8 and
custom-written scripts. Genes with missing values in >70% of arrays were
removed from the analysis and the rest of the missing values were imputed
using K-means nearest neighbor method. Lowess normalization (21) was
performed on log2-transformed data. The normalized signal intensity was
divided by the control channel intensity and the resulting log ratios from
duplicate hybridizations were averaged. After the above processing, 6,227
probes remained for further analysis. To show biological replicate similarity
and cell grouping based on gene expression patterns, hierarchical clustering
was performed using average linkage and Pearson’s correlation metric. As
expected, biological replicates clustered with the smallest distance metric
reflecting a high degree of similarity (data not shown).
Tissue-specific gene expression profiling. To obtain a list of potential
radiation-responsive genes according to the tissue of origin, data were
divided into five groups containing cell lines corresponding to each of the
four tumor types (breast carcinoma, glioma, lung carcinoma, and pancreas
carcinoma) and normal tissue. Genes that were significantly different
between untreated and irradiated samples were identified using the two-
class paired response parameter of the significance analysis of microarrays
(SAM) algorithm with 100 permutations (22). The resulting delta values
from SAM analysis for each data set were adjusted to obtain the largest gene
list that gave a <1% false discovery rate (FDR). From the statistically
significant genes identified by SAM, Venn diagrams were constructed to
identify genes common to any two cancer categories from the four cancer
types tested, and between genes common to any two cancer categories set
and normal cell lines.
Network and pathway analysis. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA;
Ingenuity Systems)9 was used for evaluating the functional significance of

radiation-induced gene profiles. Specified lists of genes identified by SAM as
being affected by radiation were used for network generation and pathway
analyses implemented in IPA tools. HUGO official gene names for the
selected gene lists were uploaded into the IPA, which was then mapped to
the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base. The so-called focus genes were
then used for generating biological networks. A score was generated for
each network according to the fit of the original set of significant genes.
This score reflects the negative logarithm of the P value, which indicates the
likelihood of the focus genes in a network being found together due to
random chance. Using a 99% confidence level, scores of z2 were considered
significant. Significances for biological functions were then assigned to each
network by determining a P value for the enrichment of the genes in the
network for such functions compared with the whole Ingenuity Pathway
Knowledge Base as a references set.
Results
The goal of this study was to compare the radiation-induced
gene translation profiles generated from human tumor cell lines
that corresponded to tumors that are typically treated with
radiotherapy, a panel that included five gliomas, four pancreatic
carcinomas, three breast carcinomas, and two non–small cell lung
carcinomas. In addition, radiation-induced gene translation
profiles were generated for four normal human cell lines: a skin
fibroblast (BJ), two lung fibroblasts (MRC5, MRC9), and mammary
epithelial cells. All cell lines used in this study were capable of
forming colonies in monolayer culture and were evaluated in log-
phase growth. Specifically, cell lines were exposed to 2 Gy or sham-
irradiated, polysome-bound RNA was isolated 6 hours later and
subjected to microarray analysis. Each cell line was evaluated in
biological replicates.
To identify the genes whose translation was either up-regulated
or down-regulated by radiation, biological replicates were averaged
for each cell line and compared with the polysome-bound RNA
profiles generated from their corresponding control (unirradiated)
cells using SAM (<1% FDR). The cell lines were then compared in
terms of the genes whose translational activity was affected by
radiation using a two-way heat map with average linkage distance
and Pearson’s correlation metric (Fig. 1). The glioma and
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines clustered according to tumor type;
the breast and lung tumor cell lines were considerably more
heterogeneous, being interspersed among each other. In contrast,
the normal cell lines, which included skin fibroblasts, lung
fibroblasts, and mammary epithelial cells were strikingly homoge-
neous, forming a definitive cluster separate from the tumor cell
lines. This cluster analysis suggests similarities among cell lines
within the specific histologies with respect to radiation-induced
translational gene expression profiles. Accordingly, we then
determined the specific genes that were commonly affected in
the cell lines corresponding to each tumor type and normal tissue
(Table 1). Each of the tumor types as well as the normal cells
contained a significant number of commonly affected genes as
determined by SAM. The glioma and pancreatic carcinoma cell
lines each had a greater number of common genes than in the
breast and lung carcinomas, which is consistent with greater
degree of heterogeneity among the breast and lung tumor cell lines
as illustrated in Fig. 1. The four normal cell lines also contained a
relatively large number of commonly affected genes. Thus, these
data indicate that although there were cell line–specific responses,
among cell lines initiated from the same histology, there was a
common subset of genes whose translational activity was affected
by radiation.
To provide insight into the potential functional implications of
tumor type specificity in the radiation-induced gene translation
profiles, the genes common to each of the tumor histologies shown
in Table 1 were placed in the context of the known interactome
using IPA. The five most significant networks and their
corresponding top functions for each tumor type are shown in
Table 2. Given the degree of enrichment in the networks, which is
reflected by the significance score and the number of focus
molecules (out of a possible 35), these results indicate that the

genes subject to radiation-induced translational control do not
simply comprise a random list and may be of potential functional
consequence. As expected for data derived from tumor cell lines,
cancer and cell cycle were the most represented functions in each
of the histologies. However, there were also a number of functions
that seemed histology-specific. For example, the top network for
breast, lung, glioma, and pancreas was associated with gene
expression, viral function, embryonic development and cellular
assembly and organization, respectively.
The next step was to compare the gene subsets comprising the
radiation-induced translational profiles of tumor and normal cells.
Towards this end, we initially identified genes that were commonly
affected across the four tumor histologies. As shown by the Venn
diagrams in Fig. 2A , although there were few genes in common
among the four tumor types, there were a substantial number of
genes in common between any two cancer types. Therefore, to
account for tumor cell line heterogeneity and to generate a list of
tumor-derived radiation-affected genes, the genes common to any
two tumor types (2,658 genes: 1,323 increased and 1,335 decreased)
were selected for further analysis (23). This subset of tumor genes
was then compared with those affected in the normal cells
(as shown in Table 1). The Venn diagram (Fig. 2B) indicates that a
set of 507 (increased plus decreased) genes was detected in the
radiation-induced translational profiles of both tumor and normal
cell lines. However, importantly, there was also a set of genes that
were unique to either tumor cells or normal cells.
The gene sets unique to tumor or normal cells as defined in
Fig. 2 were then distributed into networks of known biological
pathways using IPA, with the biological functions associated with
the top 10 networks identified for tumor and normal cells shown in
Table 3. Although there was some overlap in functions, there were
also clear distinctions between tumor and normal cells. The
number 1 ranked network from tumor cells was associated with
cancer, cell cycle and skeletal and muscular disorders, whereas for
normal cells, the top network was associated with cell to cell
signaling and interaction, tissue development, and organismal
development. For each cell type, there was a significant enrichment
of genes associated with functions typically associated with
radioresponse such as cell cycle, cell signaling, and DNA repli-
cation, recombination, and repair. In addition, both normal and
cancer cells were enriched in genes involved in RNA posttran-
scriptional modifications, which has only recently been associated
with radioresponse (3).
To better illustrate the differences in radiation-induced transla-
tional profiles between tumor and normal cells, the genes
comprising the top-ranked networks for cancer cells and normal
cells are shown in Fig. 3. The top network derived from the genes
unique to the cancer cell lines centered on a decrease in Myc , with
the other genes in this network either increased or decreased in
response to radiation (Fig. 3A, left). Evaluation of this same network
overlaying the gene values from the normal cell gene subset
revealed fewer genes affected by radiation, and for those that were,
the effect of radiation was in the opposite direction as compared
with the cancer cells, including Myc (Fig. 3A, right). The hub of
the top network derived from the genes unique to normal cells was
b-catenin (CTNNB1; Fig. 3B, left). In the normal gene enrichment,

b-catenin was up-regulated and was surrounded by 34 interacting
genes whose translation was affected by radiation. Analysis of this
network overlaying the gene values from the cancer cell gene
subset revealed far fewer genes affected by radiation (Fig. 3B, right).
Thus, the top networks with Myc and b-catenin as hubs are
indicative of differences between cancer and normal cells in terms
of radiation-induced gene translational profiles.
Discussion
Whereas there are a number of reports defining the cellular
transcriptome after irradiation, the goal of the current study was to
generate a whole genome perspective of radiation-induced changes
in gene translation for a series of cell lines commonly used in cancer
research. In previous work directly comparing the microarray
analyses of total RNA and polysome-bound RNA after the
irradiation of three glioma cell lines, few, if any genes were found
to be commonly affected in both procedures (3). These results
suggested that the radiation-induced changes in transcription and
translation are not coordinated, with each proceeding through
different regulatory mechanisms. This is consistent with a similar
role for translational control of gene expression observed after other
forms of cell stress (9, 10). The independence of these two events
was further supported by data indicating that the radiation-induced
changes in translation, as detected in the microarray analysis of
polysome-bound RNA, occur through the recruitment of existing
mRNAs to and away from polysomes (3). Thus, these results,
combined with those for other types of stress, indicate that as
compared with transcriptional changes, analysis of the radiation-
induced changes in gene translation provides a unique data set.
Along these lines, analyses of radiation-induced gene expression
using total cellular RNA (i.e., traditional microarray analysis) have
revealed few commonly affected genes among cell lines initiated
from the same tissue type (1–4). Accordingly, based on the analysis
of the cellular transcriptome, radiation-induced gene expression is
considered to be independent of the tissue of origin and highly
dependent on the individual cell genotype (1, 4). However, when
evaluated at the level of translation, as shown here, radiation-
induced gene expression exhibits a significant degree of tissue
dependence. For the 18 cell lines evaluated, radiation-induced
translational profiles, for the most part, clustered according to
tissue of origin, with each histologic category containing a
significant number of commonly affected genes. A tissue type
dependency for radiation-induced gene expression would have a
number of potential implications. With respect to cancer
treatment, if gene expression influences tumor cell radiosensitivity,
then the optimal preclinical development of targets for radiation
modifiers would take into consideration tumor type. In addition,
independent of whether the induced changes in gene expression
directly contribute to radiosensitivity, its tissue type dependency
may provide a source of biomarkers indicative of radiation
exposure in treatment as well as environmental settings.
A long sought goal in the use of radiation in cancer treatment has
been to identify exploitable differences in the radioresponse of
tumor and normal tissue. Comparisons of the radiation-induced
gene translation profiles obtained from the tumor and normal cell
lines revealed clearly different gene subsets as well as an overall
greater degree of homogeneity among the four normal cell lines.
Radiosensitivity or the mode of cell death is unlikely to account for
the difference between these normal and tumor cells in that, in
contrast with cells of hematopoietic or lymphatic origin, the normal
cells in this study die through mitotic catastrophe, as do the solid
tumor cell lines. A more likely explanation pertains to translation in
general. It is becoming increasing well recognized that abnormal
translation is a fundamental characteristic of tumor cells and a
potential target for cancer treatment (24). This abnormality has
been attributed to signaling pathways involved in translation such
as those mediated by Ras, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, or mTOR
(15, 24), which have also been implicated in radioresponse, as well
as by overexpression of components of the general translational
machinery such as eIF4E (25). Whether these molecules play a role
in the radiation-induced regulation of gene translation remains to
be investigated. However, the disparity between the radiation-
induced gene translation profiles generated for cancer and normal
cell lines are consistent with the abnormal translation in tumor cells.
In addition to general differences between tumor and normal
cells, because of the strong correlation between translational
control and the cell proteome, gene translation profiles may serve
as high-throughput approach for identifying the specific proteins
that selectively participate in the radioresponse of each cell type. For
example, the top functional network derived from the genes unique
to the cancer cell lines hadMyc at its primary hub, the expression of
which was decreased by radiation. Whereas the effects of radiation
on all the proteins in this network remained to be defined, the
decrease in Myc protein is consistent with that previously reported
for human tumor cell lines (26). Myc is well established to play a role
in transformation and cell cycle control; although it has been
implicated in radioresponse, the specific processes have yet to be
clearly defined (27). For normal cells, the primary hub protein in the
top network was h-catenin, which is consistent with recent reports
showing that irradiation of normal mammary progenitor cells
results in increased h-catenin protein (28, 29). Moreover, h-catenin
protects against radiation-induced death in these normal cells
(28, 29), although the specific processes have not been defined. Thus,
whereas further investigations validating specific protein changes
are clearly required, the study presented here suggests that
radiation-induced translational gene expression profiles provide a
framework for identifying and targeting differences in the regulation
of tumor and normal cell radiosensitivity.
