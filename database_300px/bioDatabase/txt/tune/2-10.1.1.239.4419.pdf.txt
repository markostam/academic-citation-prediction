THE COMPLETE INTEGRABILITY OF A LIE-POISSON
SYSTEM PROPOSED BY BLOCH AND ISERLES
Luen-Chau Li and Carlos Tomei
Dedicated with affect and admiration to Percy Deift on the occasion of his 60th birthday
Abstract. We establish the Liouville integrability of the differential equation S˙(t) =
[N, S2(t)], recently considered by Bloch and Iserles. Here, N is a real, fixed, skew-
symmetric matrix and S is real symmetric. The equation is realized as a Hamiltonian
vector field on a coadjoint orbit of a loop group, and sufficiently many commuting
integrals are presented, together with a solution formula for their related flows in
terms of a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem. We also answer a question raised
by Bloch and Iserles, by realizing the same system on a coadjoint orbit of a finite
dimensional Lie group.
Keywords: Integrable systems, Lax pairs, Toda flows, loop groups.

1. Introduction.
In a recent paper [BI], Bloch and Iserles considered the differential equation
S˙(t) = [N,S2(t)], (∗)
where both S and N are real n × n matrices, S is symmetric and N is a constant
skew-symmetric matrix. The similarity with the celebrated Toda differential equa-
tion ([F], [Mo]) is hard to miss, and one might expect that both equations have
some common properties. Indeed, from the equivalent Lax pair formulation
S˙ = [NS + SN,S]
Bloch and Iserles deduced that S evolves by orthogonal conjugation: this implies
global existence of solutions and spectrum invariance of S(t). Also, following Man-
akov’s approach to the rigid body equation [Ma], they showed that (*) is equivalent
to the following Lax equation with spectral parameter
(S + zN). = [NS + SN + zN2, S + zN ],

from which a large collection of conserved quantities is clear, namely, the nontriv-
ial coefficients in z in the expansions of tr(S + zN)k. Even more, they showed
that equation (*) is a Lie-Poisson system on an appropriate phase space and, cor-
roborated by numerical experiments, conjectured the complete integrability of the
system.
In this paper, we shall formulate equation (*) as a Hamiltonian system on a
coadjoint orbit of a loop group, in the spirit of [DLT2]. The situation is rather
familiar: most of the difficulty lies in guessing the loop group and a convenient
representation of the dual of its Lie algebra. In this case, the group is LGΣ−, the set of
smooth loops g : S1 → GL(N,C) satisfying the reality condition g(z) = g(z¯) which
admit an analytic continuation to the exterior of the unit circle with g(∞) = I, the
identity matrix, and which are kept fixed by the involution Σ(g)(z) = (g(−z)T )−1.
The nondegenerate pairing on arbitrary loops
(X,Y ) =
∮
|z|=1
tr(X(z)Y (z))

∑

tr(XjY−j−1)
identifies the Lie algebra dual (Lgσ−)
∗ with the set of power series S0 +N1z + . . . ,
where the coefficients of the powers zk, k = 0, 1, . . . , are alternatively symmetric
and skew-symmetric real matrices.
The proof of Liouville integrability of the Bloch-Iserles equation (*) takes two
familiar forms. In one of them, embed LGΣ− into the larger loop group LG
Σ of all
smooth invertible loops and there search for a second bracket structure, induced by
an R-matrix, from which the existence of commuting integrals follows. Otherwise,
consider the Lie group LGΣ+ × LG
Σ
−, corresponding to the Lie algebra anti-direct
sum Lgσ+ ⊖ Lg
σ
− which as a manifold can be identified with the subset of loops in
LGΣ which admit a Birkhoff factorization g = g+g
−1
− with trivial diagonal part
([PS] is a good reference for the few facts about Birkhoff factorization which will
be used in this paper). The Lie bracket of Lgσ+ ⊖ Lg
σ
− is of course identical to the
bracket defined by the R-matrix above. Both points of view will be described in an
intertwined fashion in Sections 2 and 3. Integrability is then proved in Section 4 by
showing that the integrals suggested by Bloch and Iserles are indeed commuting,
and generically span half of the dimension of the coadjoint orbit of interest. A
formula for the commuting flows in terms of a Birkhoff factorization is the content
of Section 5.
The loop group scenario embeds equation (*) for n×n matrices into a coadjoint
orbit O of generic dimension 2[n2/4] (here [x] is the greatest integer less than or
equal to x). In Section 6, we consider a question raised by Bloch and Iserles in their
original paper: to find a finite dimensional matrix group such that their equation
is realized as a Hamiltonian system on the dual of its Lie algebra. In [BI], the
authors presented an interesting algorithm to study this problem, adapted from a
constructive proof of Ado’s theorem, which states that any finite dimensional Lie
algebra admits a matricial faithful representation. From the loop group setup, we
obtain an explicit realization: there is an n2-dimensional nilpotent matrix groupGf ,
faithfully realized on 3n × 3n matrices, giving rise to a coadjoint orbit isomorphic
LIE-POISSON SYSTEM 3
to O. The prescription yielding the finite dimensional realization is simple and
rather general. Since the orbit O is described in terms of (bi-)truncated Laurent
expansions of its elements, one should expect that the full group is not needed to
cover the orbit. Indeed, as we shall see, only the first three terms of a loop in LGΣ−
are relevant to the computation of the coadjoint action on the orbit of interest.
This suggests taking a quotient Gf = LG
Σ
−/LG
Σ
−3 by the normal subgroup LG
Σ
−3
of loops of the form I+O(z−3): it turns out that Gf admits a simple Heisenberg-like
representation.
In the final section, we present an example of an infinite dimensional orbit ob-
tained by the same coadjoint action. Here, the Hamiltonian which gives rise to
equation (*) in the small orbit now induces a system of partial differential equa-
tions containing some simple integral terms.
Arieh Iserles informed us that a forthcoming paper, together with A. Bloch, T.
Ratiu and J. Marsden, will be dedicated to a different proof of the integrability of
the Bloch-Iserles equation, using very different techniques.

2. The Lie algebraic setup and the Poisson structure.
Let G be GL(N,R) with Lie algebra g, and let LG be the group of loops g :
S1 −→ GL(N,C) satisfying the reality condition g(z) = g(z¯). We consider the
involutive automorphism Σ : LG −→ LG, given by Σ(g)(z) = (g(−z)T )−1 and its
fixed point set (the stable locus)
LGΣ = { g ∈ LG | g(z)(g(−z))T = I }. (2.1)
Clearly, LGΣ is a Lie subgroup of LG. We shall denote by LGΣ+ (resp. LG
Σ
−) the
Lie subgroup of LGΣ consisting of loops which extend analytically to the interior
(resp. to the exterior) of the unit circle, with the additional requirement that loops
in LGΣ− take the value I, the identity matrix, at ∞.
Let Lg be the Lie algebra of LG, consisting of loops X(z) =
∑∞
−∞Xjz
j with
coefficients Xj ∈ g. Then the Lie algebra Lg
σ of LGΣ is the stable locus of the
linearization σ : Lg −→ Lg of Σ, given by the formula
σ(X)(z) = −(X(−z))T =
∑
j
θ(Xj)(−z)
j (2.2)
where θ is the Cartan involution ξ 7→ −ξT . Therefore, if k (resp. p) denote the +1
(resp.−1) eigenspace of θ, consisting of skew-symmetric (resp. symmetric) matrices,
then explicitly,
Lgσ = {X ∈ Lg | X2j ∈ k, X2j+1 ∈ p for all j }. (2.3)
From the definition of LGΣ+ (resp. LG
Σ
−), it is clear that its Lie algebra Lg
σ
+
(resp. Lgσ−) consists of elements of the form
∑
j≥0Xjz
j (resp.
∑
j<0Xjz
j). Hence
the elements in Lgσ− are equal to 0 at ∞ and we have the splitting
Lgσ = Lgσ+ ⊕ Lg
σ
− (2.4)
4 L.-C. LI AND C. TOMEI
with associated projection maps Π+ and Π−.
We now introduce
G˜ = {g ∈ LGΣ | g = g+g
−1
− , where g− ∈ LG
Σ
−, g+ ∈ LG
Σ
+ }. (2.5)
Then an easy argument shows that for g ∈ G˜, the factors g± are unique (more
details will be provided in Section 5). Moreover, from the Birkhoff factorization
theorem [PS], G˜ is a dense open subset of LGΣ in the natural topology. Following
the procedure in [DLT1],[DLT2], we can endow G˜ with a Lie group structure by
defining the multiplication
g ∗ h ≡ g+hg
−1
− . (2.6)
Clearly, the map Ψ : G˜ −→ LGΣ+ × LG
Σ
− given by Ψ(g) = Ψ(g+g
−1
− ) 7→ (g+, g−)
is a Lie group isomorphism, when the image is equipped with the product group
structure. Consequently, the pull-back of the standard Lie bracket on Lgσ+ ⊕ Lg
σ
−
(Lie algebra direct sum) under ψ = TeΨ : X 7→ (Π+X,−Π−X) yields the Lie
bracket on g˜ = Lie(G˜):
[X,Y ]g˜ = [Π+X,Π+Y ]− [ Π−X,Π−Y ] (2.7)
for all X,Y ∈ g˜. Similarly, one may use ψ to obtain a formula for the adjoint action
of G˜ on g˜,
AdG˜(g)X = g−(Π−X)g
−1
− + g+(Π+X)g
−1
+ . (2.8)
Remark 2.1 By standard r-matrix theory [STS],
R = Π+ −Π− (2.9)
is a solution of the modified Yang-Baxter equation, i.e.,
[RX,RY ]−R([RX,Y ] + [X,RY ]) = −[X,Y ] (2.10)
for all X,Y ∈ Lgσ. By an easy computation, we can show that the R-bracket on
Lgσ given by
[X,Y ]R =
1
2
([RX,Y ] + [X,RY ]) (2.11)
coincides with [·, ·]g˜. Thus the vector space Lg
σ equipped with the Lie bracket [·, ·]R
is identical to the Lie algebra g˜.
To identify the duals of the Lie algebras, we introduce the following nondegen-
erate invariant pairing on Lg:
(X,Y ) =
∮
|z|=1
tr(X(z)Y (z))
dz
2πi
=
∑
j
tr(XjY−j−1).
(2.12)
LIE-POISSON SYSTEM 5
As the reader will see, this choice of pairing is critical for what we have in mind.
Using this pairing, we identify the algebraic dual (Lgσ)∗ of Lgσ with the stable
locus of the Lie algebra anti-isomorphism σ∗ = −σ:
Lgσ
∗
= {X ∈ Lg | X2j+1 ∈ k, X2j ∈ p for all j }. (2.13)
Notice that the alternation of symmetric and skew-symmetric coefficients in the
Laurent expansion still holds, now with a parity opposite to the one found in
elements in the Lie algebra. By an easy computation making use of (2.8) and
(2.12), we find
Ad∗
G˜
(g)A = Π−(g
−1
+ Ag+) + Π+(g
−1
− Ag−) (2.14)
where we have used the fact that Π∗+ = Π− and Π
∗
− = Π+.
Remark 2.2 In the general context of an involutive automorphism of a finite
dimensional Lie algebra, the author in [R] also considered the stable locus of the
corresponding involution on the loop algebra. However, a different choice of pairing
was used in [R], thus leading to a different identification of the dual.
Finally, the Lie-Poisson structure for smooth functions on g˜∗ is given by the
usual formula:
{F1, F2}(X) = (X, [dF1(X), dF2(X)]g˜). (2.15)
3. A Hamiltonian for the Bloch-Iserles equation.
The following result is standard.
Proposition 3.1. For 1 ≤ k ≤ n, ℓ ∈ Z, define
Hkℓ(X) =
1
(k + 1)
∮
|z|=1
tr(X(z)k+1)
dz
2πizℓ+1
, (3.1)
then the Hkℓ’s Poisson commute with respect to {·, ·}. The Hamiltonian equation
of motion generated by Hkℓ is given by
X˙(z) =
[
Π+((X(z)
kz−(ℓ+1)),X(z)
]
. (3.2)
Proof. Since Ad∗g(X)(z) = g(z)
−1X(z)g(z), the Hamiltonians are invariant under
the coadjoint action of LGΣ, i.e.
Hkℓ(Ad
∗
g(X)) = Hkℓ(X), g ∈ LG
Σ.
By classical r-matrix theory, we then conclude that they Poisson commute. The
equation of motion for Hkℓ is a straightforward computation. 
Our next task is to search for interesting finite dimensional coadjoint orbits in
g˜∗. For any m,n ∈ Z+, define
g˜∗(m,n) = {X ∈ Lg
σ∗ | X(z) =
n∑
j=−m
Xjz
j }. (3.3)
Clearly, we can extend this definition to the case where m = 0 in which case we set
g˜∗n = g˜
∗
(0,n).
6 L.-C. LI AND C. TOMEI
Proposition 3.2. The sets g˜∗(m,n) are invariant under Ad
∗
G˜
(g) for any g ∈ G˜.
Proof. Take X ∈ g˜∗(m,n). For m = 0, the analyticity property of g± implies that
Π−(g
−1
+ Xg+) = 0,
Π+(g
−1
− Xg−) = Xnz
n +
n−1∑
j=0
Bjz

for some matrices Bj , and we are done (we have used g−(∞) = I in deriving the
second line above). For m ∈ Z+, note that
Ad∗
G˜
(g)X = Π−(g
−1
+ (Π−X)g+) + Π+(g
−1
− (Π+X)g−).
Therefore, the same calculation as before applied to Π+X shows that
Π+(g
−1
− (Π+X)g−) = Xnz
n +
n−1∑
j=0
Bjz

for some matrices Bj . On the other hand, it is easy to check that
Π−(g
−1
+ (Π−X)g+) = g+(0)
TX−mg+(0) +
−1∑
j=−m+1
Cjz
j
for some matrices Cj . Putting the above two expressions together, the assertion
follows. 
As a consequence of this result, we obtain finite dimensional coadjoint orbits
through the elements in g˜∗n and g˜
∗
(m,n) and the Hamiltonian equation in (3.2) re-
stricts to these orbits. In the rest of the section, we shall focus on the case g˜∗1, in
which the Bloch-Iserles equation lies.
Proposition 3.3. (a) Consider the loop S0 + zN0 ∈ g˜
∗
1. The Ad
∗
G˜
-orbit through
S0 + zN0 is given by the affine linear space
OS0+zN0 = {Ad
∗
G˜
(g)(S0 + zN0) | g ∈ G˜ } = {(S0 + [N0, P ]) + zN0 | P ∈ p }.
In particular, if N0 has simple spectrum, the tangent space of OS0+zN0 is naturally
identified with the vector space of real, symmetric matrices which are orthogonal to
the matrix polynomials p(N20 ).
(b) The Hamiltonian equation of motion
(S + zN). =
[
Π+((S + zN)
2/z)), S + zN
]
(3.5)
LIE-POISSON SYSTEM 7
generated by H20 on the Poisson submanifold g˜
∗
1 is equivalent to the Bloch-Iserles
equation
N˙ = 0,
S˙ = [NS + SN,S ].
(3.6)
Proof. We have
g−(z) = I + g
′
−(∞)z
−1 +O(z−2)
where g′−(∞) =
dg−
dz−1 (z =∞) and a simple computation obtains
OS0+zN0 = {S0 + [N0, g
′
−(∞)] + zN0}.
Since g−1− (z) = (g−(−z))
T , the matrix g′−(∞) must be symmetric and, conversely,
any symmetric matrix P ∈ p is g′−(∞) for an appropriate loop g−. Now, endow p
with the usual inner product < P,Q >= tr PQ. Then the linear map BN0 : p → p
taking P to [P,N0] is skew symmetric and its range is orthogonal to its kernel, given
by the set of symmetric matrices commuting with N0. If N0 has simple spectrum,
the description of the tangent space to the orbit then follows. The equation of
motion for H20 is easy to compute, once one observes that only S may vary in an
orbit in g˜∗1. 
Remark 3.4 (a) From the proof of Proposition 3.2, it should be clear that for
X ∈ g˜∗n, the equations in (3.2) can be regarded as Hamiltonian systems on the
coadjoint orbits of the Lie group LGΣ−, when the dual (Lg
σ
−)
∗ of its Lie algebra is
identified with the collection of power series S0 +N1z + . . . , where the coefficients
of the powers zk, k = 0, 1, . . . are alternatively symmetric and skew-symmetric real
matrices. The advantage of using the slightly more general formulation here is that
it puts the groups LGΣ+ and LG
Σ
− on equal footing. Otherwise, the relevance of
LGΣ+ in the solution formula in Proposition 5.1 may look somewhat mysterious.
(b) The Bloch-Iserles equation can be regarded as an isospectral deformation of
a general n × n matrix keeping the skew-symmetric part fixed. Indeed, if we set
z = 1 in (S + zN). = [NS + SN + zN2, S + zN ] and let M = S + N , then a
straightforward calculation shows that
M˙ =
1
4
[
(MTM +MMT ) + (MT )2,M
]
. (3.7)
Conversely, if M satisfies the above equation, then
M˙T =
1
4
[ (MTM +MMT ) +M2,MT ] (3.8)
and by a direct computation, we find (M − MT ). = 0. Now, the Bloch-Iserles
equation preserves the spectral curve det(S+zN−w) = 0. (See Remark 4.3 below.)
On the other hand, the Toda flow in [DLT1] also has a spectral curve, given by
det(M+h(MT−M)−w) = 0. If we writeM = S+N , then by changing the variable
8 L.-C. LI AND C. TOMEI
h above in the obvious way, we can make the Toda curve coincide with det(S +
zN −w) = 0. Percy Deift asked us if (3.7) might arise from a combination of flows
associated to the Toda curve. To answer this question, note that any flow generated
by a combination of the coefficients from the Toda curve must be of the form
M˙ = [Πl F (M,M
T ),M ]. (See [DL].) Here, l is the Lie subalgebra of g consisting of
lower triangular matrices and Πl is the projection map to l relative to the splitting
g = k ⊕ l, and F (M,MT ) is a polynomial in M and MT . If we denote the right
hand side of (3.7) by X(M), then it is obvious that X(OMOT ) = OX(M)OT for
any orthogonal matrix O. However, the expression [Πl F (M,M
T ),M ] clearly does
not satisfy this invariance property. Hence the answer to the above question is in
the negative. From a different point of view, it is also tempting to see if one can
constrain the flows arising from the Toda curve to the submanifold Q = {M ∈ g |
M −MT = N } where N is a fixed skew-symmetric matrix. Unfortunately, the
submanifold Q is not a cosymplectic submanifold in the sense of Weinstein [W].
(The cosymplectic submanifolds are the generalization in a Poisson context where
we can carry out Dirac’s idea of constraining a Hamiltonian system.) Thus this
idea also fails.
4. Liouville integrability.
Let symij(A,B), the ij-symmetrizer of matrices A and B, denote the sum of all
monomials in A and B of degree i+ j consisting of i A′s and j B′s.
Lemma 4.1. (a) [ symi,j+1(A,B) , A ] + [ symi+1,j(A,B) , B ] = 0.
(b) Let A = S be symmetric and B = N skew-symmetric. Then symij(S,N) is
symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) if j is even (resp. odd).
(c) If A and B are n × n matrices, than each symmetrizer symn−ℓ,ℓ(A,B), ℓ =
0, . . . , n, is a linear combination of symmetrizers symr,s(A,B), of smaller degree
r + s < n.
(d) For generic choices of A and B (i.e., for an open, dense set of pairs (A,B)),
symk−ℓ,ℓ(A,B), k, ℓ = 0, . . . , n − 1, are linearly independent. The same is true for
generic choices of A = S symmetric and B = N skew-symmetric.
Proof. To simplify notation, we omit the obvious matrix dependence of symij.
Statement (a) follows from
symi+1,j+1 = A symi,j+1 +B symi+1,j = symi,j+1 A+ symi+1,j B.
The first equality states that any monomial in symi+1,j+1 either starts with A and
is completed with i A′s and j + 1 B′s or starts with B and is completed with
i+1 A′s and j B′s. The second equality is obtained by taking into account the last
matrix of each monomial. The proof of (b) is obvious. To see (c), notice that the
claim for i = 0 (resp. i = n) is just the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for B (resp. A).
More generally, write the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for the matrix M = A+ zB,
−Mn = σ1M
n−1 + σ2M
n−2 + . . .+ σnM
0,
LIE-POISSON SYSTEM 9
where σj = σj(z), a standard symmetric function of the eigenvalues of M , is a
polynomial of degree j in z. Now collect terms in z: on the left hand side, the
coefficient of zj is of the form symn−ℓ,ℓ; on the right hand side, it is a linear
combination of symmetrizers of degree smaller than n. To prove (d), let B∗ be the
matrix whose only nonzero entries, equal to one, lie along the subdiagonal of entries
with indices (r, s) satisfying r− s = 1 and let A∗ be a diagonal matrix with entries
along the diagonal in geometric progression c1, c2, . . . , cn. Clearly, symk−ℓ,ℓ only
has nonzero entries along the subdiagonal r−s = ℓ, forming a geometric progression
of order ck−ℓ. Thus, to check if a linear combination of symmetrizers is independent,
it suffices to consider the independence of subsets of symmetrizers consisting of a
fixed index ℓ (keep in mind that, by hypothesis, ℓ < n), for which k − ℓ runs from
0 to n − ℓ − 1. We thus have to prove the linear independence of n − ℓ vectors
in Rn−ℓ, with coordinates in geometric progressions of ratio c1, . . . , cn−ℓ−1: this
is clearly true for a generic choice of c (we thank Nicolau Saldanha for suggesting
matrices A∗ and B∗). From analyticity, independence holds for generic choices of A
and B, proving the first part of (d). We now show that generic independence still
holds for symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) choices of A (resp. B). By continuity,
independence still holds for matrices sufficiently close to A∗ and B∗. In particular,
this is still true if we keep S∗ = A∗ and change B∗ by adding a small negative
number on its subdiagonal of entries (r, s) for which r − s = −1, giving rise to a
matrix B˜∗. Now, consider a diagonal matrix D so that N∗ = DB˜∗D
−1 is skew-
symmetric. The pair S∗ = DA∗D
−1 and N∗ also has independent symmetrizers of
degree less than n and genericity for pairs (S,N) follows again by analiticity. 
As usual, let S and N be symmetric and skew-symmetric n×n matrices. The set
of symmetrizers symk−ℓ,ℓ(S,N) having degree k < n which are symmetric matrices
(i.e., those for which j is even, by the previous lemma) splits in two sets. The first
will give rise to the family of commuting integrals Hkℓ, the second relates to the
Casimirs of generic coadjoint orbits within g˜∗1:
I = {symk−ℓ,ℓ, 1 ≤ k ≤ n− 1, 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n− 2, ℓ even},
SN = {symℓℓ, 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n− 1, ℓ even}.
From Lemma 4.1, for a generic choice of S and N , the map BN is injective
when restricted to the vector space spanned by I: in particular, the matrices
[ symk−ℓ,ℓ(S,N) , N ], for symk−ℓ,ℓ ∈ I, are linearly independent.
Theorem 4.2. (a) Let N0 have simple spectrum and consider an element S0 +
zN0 ∈ g˜
∗
1. Then OS0+zN0 is a 2[n
2/4] dimensional affine linear space given by
{
(S + zN) ∈ g˜∗1 | N = N0, tr(SN
ℓ) = tr(S0N
ℓ
0), ℓ even , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n− 1
}
. (4.2)
(b) The equation of motion of the Hamiltonian Hkℓ is given by
S˙ = [ symk−(ℓ+1),ℓ+1(S,N) , S ] = −[ symk−ℓ,ℓ(S,N) , N ], N˙ = 0.
10 L.-C. LI AND C. TOMEI
The Hamiltonians in the set
{Hkℓ, 1 ≤ k ≤ n− 1, 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n− 2, ℓ even }
are generically independent on OS0+zN0 and provide [n
2/4] commuting integrals.
Proof. Statement (a) follows from the characterization of the tangent space to the
orbit given in Proposition 3.3, combined with the independence of the elements
of C. The first formula for the equation of motion for Hkℓ follows by expanding
X(z)k in the equation of motion as given in Proposition 3.1. The second formula
is a consequence of Lemma 4.1(a). Finally, by considering the second description,
generic independence of the vector fields is a consequence of the remarks just above
the statement of the theorem. 
Remark 4.3 Equivalently, we can consider the conserved quantities given by the
coefficients of the characteristic polynomial p(z,w) = det(S + zN − wI). Notice
that (S + zN)T = S − zN , so p(z,w) is an even function of z :
p(z,w) = det(S + zN − wI) =
N∑
r=0
[ r2 ]∑
k=0
Irk(S,N)z
2kwN−r.
The fact that the functions Irk Poisson commute also follows by coadjoint invari-
ance. Generic independence follows from the generic independence of theHkℓ. Note
that the functions I2k,k, k = 1, . . . , [n/2] clearly depends only on N and therefore
are trivial integrals. On the other hand, it is easy to see that {I2k+1,k}0≤k≤[n+12 ]−1
is equivalent to the coadjoint orbit invariants {tr(SN2k)}0≤k≤[n−1
2
]. Hence the
nontrivial integrals are given by {Irk}0≤k≤[r/2]−1,1≤r≤n and this also gives a total
of
n∑
r=1
[r
2
]
=
[

4
]
conserved quantities, as required. The fact that the spectral curve p(z,w) = 0
is preserved by the Bloch-Iserles equation means that the corresponding flow is
linearized on the corresponding Jacobian variety and that the solution can be ex-
plicitly written down in terms of Riemann theta functions. We shall leave the
details to the interested reader. (See, however, Proposition 5.2 and Remark 5.3 in
this connection.)
5. Solution by factorization.
The flows associated to the integralsHkℓ may be described by an explicit formula.
Let D+,S

− (z). Here, γ+ and γ− are
LIE-POISSON SYSTEM 11
restrictions to S1 of analytic functions extending to the boundary of D+ and D−
taking their values on GL(N,C), the matrix d(z) is diagonal with diagonal entries
of the form zai , ai ∈ Z, and γ−(∞) = I, the identity matrix. The only ingredient
which is not automatic in the derivation of the formula for the flows is the proof of
the triviality of the diagonal factor in the factorization of the loops associated to
the initial conditions.
As stated, the Birkhoff factorization of an invertible loop is not necessarily
unique. What is true, and follows from an argument similar to the given in the
proof of the proposition below, is that different factorizations have the same diago-
nal factor, up to permutation of its diagonal entries. The loops we have to consider,
however, admit a special symmetry. We follow in spirit the arguments in [GK].
Proposition 5.1. Let γ be a loop satisfying the symmetry γ(z)γT (−z) = I. Then
its Birkhoff factorization has trivial diagonal factor, d(z) = I, and is unique. More-
over, the nontrivial factors also satisfy the symmetry, γ±(z)γ
T
±(−z) = I.
Proof. Suppose γ(z) = γ+(z)d(z)γ
−1
− (z), with the notation above: we have to show
that all the integers ai are equal to 0. For a continuous function f : S
1 → C∗,
define its winding number w(f) to be the (signed) number of turns of its image
around the origin. The winding number is invariant under continuous deformations
ft through functions which avoid the origin and is additive with respect to products,
w(fg) = w(f)+w(g). Since γ+ (resp. γ−) extends to D+ (resp. D−), taking values
at invertible matrices, one may deform the loop γ to a constant loop through
loops taking values on invertible matrices, so that w(det γ+) = w(det γ−) = 0. By
additivity, w(det γ) = w(det d) =
∑
i ai. On the other hand, since γ(z)γ
T (−z) = I
and w(det γ(z)) = w(det γT (−z)), we must have w(det γ) = 0. Thus,
∑
i ai = 0.
Also from γ(z)γT (−z) = I, we have
d(z)γ−1− (z)γ
−T
− (−z)d(−z) = γ
−1
+ (z)γ
−T
+ (−z).
Equating diagonal entries of both sides, we obtain, for i = 1, . . . , n,
(γ−1− (z)γ
−T
− (−z))ii = (−1)
aiz−2ai(γ−1+ (z)γ
−T
+ (−z))i,i,
which we denote, with the obvious attributions, by f−(z) = z
−2aig+(z). Clearly,
the hypothesis γ−(∞) = I implies f−(∞) = 1. Suppose ai < 0 for some i. Then
the function h(z), which agrees with f− on D− and with z
−2aif+(z) on D+ is an
entire, bounded function — a constant — satisfying h(0) = 0 and h(∞) = 1. The
upshot is that ai ≥ 0, and since
∑
i ai = 0, we must have ai = 0 for all i. A
similar argument involving Liouville’s theorem obtains uniqueness of factorization.
Symmetry of γ± in turn follows from unique factorization applied to the equation
γ(z) = γ+(z)γ

As we noted earlier, the vector space Lgσ equipped with the Lie bracket in
(2.11) coincides with g˜. Since the modified Yang-Baxter equation (eqn. (2.10)) is a
factorization condition, our next result is standard ([STS]). We sketch the argument
in order to check that the symmetries required in the previous proposition to obtain
the Birkhoff factorization with trivial diagonal factor indeed hold.

Proof. First, notice that, for any real t, the loop γ(t, z) = exp(−tfkℓ(X0(z), z))
satisfies the hypothesis of the previous proposition. Indeed, it suffices to check that,
for even ℓ, δ(z) = −fkℓ(X0(z), z) satisfies the linearization δ(z)+δ
T (−z) = 0, which
is obvious. Thus g− and g+ are uniquely determined from exp(−tfkℓ(X0(z), z)) =
g+(t, z)g

− (t, z). Differentiating the above expression, we obtain

for X(t, z) = g−1+ (t, z)X0(z)g+(t, z) = g
−1
− (t, z)X0(z)g−(t, z). Taking the derivative
of the first expression for X(t, z), we obtain
X˙(t, z) =

= [Π+fkℓ(X(t, z), z)),X(t, z) ] .

Remark 5.3 The Birkhoff factorization for g±(t, z) above can be solved explicitly
in terms of Riemann theta functions. See, for example, [RS] and [DL] for details.
Remark 5.4 In the nonperiodic Toda hierarchy, there are vector fields whose
solution for a given initial condition S0 are especially simple at integer times. One
example is associated to the QR factorization of exp(tf(S0)) for f(x) = ln(x).
This evolution is related to the QR iteration, a starting point of many algorithms
to compute eigenvalues ([S],[DNT]). In a similar fashion, there are evolutions related
to some of the Hamiltonians Hkℓ which are algebraically solvable at integer times,
since the Birkhoff factorization may be performed explicitly on loops of matrices
with polynomial entries.

6. A finite dimensional group for the Bloch-Iserles equation.
We now indicate how to obtain a finite dimensional group which induces a coad-
joint orbit diffeomorphic to OS0+zN0 , on which the Bloch-Iserles equation arises as
a Hamiltonian system. This construction answers a question addressed in [BI].

(convolution) matrix Mg which, in Fourier variables, corresponds to multiplying a
(matrix) function defined on the circle by g(z). The matrix Mg is obtained by
prescribing the same basis {. . . , z−2, z−1, z0, z, z2, . . . } on domain and range. It
is block upper triangular, with n × n blocks indexed by (Mg)ij , equal to g−k for
i− j = −k. Upper unipotent convolution matrices form a group M, and matrices
associated to loops admitting the symmetry g(z)gT (−z) = I form a subgroup
MΣ. Consider the normal subgroupMΣ3 of M
Σ on which the diagonals associated
to k = 1 and 2 have zero entries: such matrices correspond to loops of the form

the formula for the coadjoint action of LGΣ− through the loop S + zN described
in Section 3. Clearly, the same Hamiltonians defined in Section 3 induce the same
flows in this setup.
7. Another coadjoint orbit.
From formula (2.18), it is clear that an n×n matrix N0 with a large kernel gives
rise to especially small coadjoint orbits. or a concrete example, split an arbitrary
symmetric matrix S into blocks,
S =

 a b uTb c vT
u v B

 (6.1)
where a, b and c are real numbers, u and v are vectors of dimension n − 2 and B
is a real, symmetric matrix of dimension n − 2. A direct computation shows that
the flow S˙ = [N,S2] is equivalent to the equations
a˙ = 2〈u, v〉,
b˙ = 〈v, v〉 − 〈u, u〉,
c˙ = −2〈u, v〉 = −a˙,
B˙ = 0.
(6.2)
With the same notation as above, the equation S˙ = [N,S3] reads
a˙ = 2b3 + 2ba2 + 2b(〈v, v〉 + 〈u, u〉) + 2〈u,Bv〉,
b˙ = −2a3 − 2ab2 −−2a(〈u, u〉 + 〈v, v〉) + 〈v,Bv〉 − 〈u,Bu〉,
c˙ = −a˙,
u˙ = (b2 + a2)v + bBu− aBv + 〈u, v〉u+ 〈v, v〉v +B2v,
v˙ = −(b2 + a2)u− aBu− bBv − 〈u, u〉u − 〈u, v〉v −B2u.
(6.3)
We select a simple special case. Suppose u and v are points in a possibly complex
vector space V . Say B is a symmetric matrix (i.e., BT = B) acting on V , so that
its entries may be complex, and suppose that V splits in two subspaces Ve and
Vo (we will denote them by even and odd vectors), which are real orthogonal to
each other and are interchanged by B. In particular, we have 〈u,B2k+1v〉 = 0, for
all natural k, for u and v with the same parity. Finally, suppose that, at time 0,
the entries a, b and c are 0, and the vectors u and v have the same parity. Then
we must have that a, b and c are kept constant equal to 0 and u and v preserve
their parity. Indeed, the requirement that a, b and c = −a are constant equal to
zero is compatible with their evolutions, and the remaining equations, keeping the
notation above to denote the real inner product on V , become
u˙ = 〈u, v〉u + 〈v, v〉v +B2v,
v˙ = 〈u, u〉u − 〈u, v〉v −B2u,
(6.4)
LIE-POISSON SYSTEM 15
which respect parity. From uniqueness of solutions for a differential equation, what-
ever solves this smaller system actually is the unique solution of the original system
provided a, b and c stay put.
We consider an infinite dimensional version of the above system. Take B = iDx,
so that B2 = −Dxx, and take u(x) and v(x) to be simultaneously either even or
odd functions in the variable x. Let the inner product denote the usual real product
in L2(dx). The evolution equations for the functions u(t, x) and v(t, x) read
ut = 〈u, v〉u + 〈v, v〉v − vxx,
vt = 〈u, u〉u− 〈u, v〉v + uxx.
(6.5)
In particular, this integro-differential system preserves the original parity and the
reality of the initial conditions.
Other partial differential equations which fit the format S˙(t) = [N,Sk] may
be obtained as follows. Set S = Mq the operator given by multiplication by the
function q(x). Choose now N = DMα +MαD, where D is the partial derivative
with respect to x. Clearly, N is skew-symmetric and the evolution equation for
the operators becomes qt = 2α(q
k)x. These differential equations admit hierarchies
of infinitely many conserved quantities, but some of these conserved quantities
generate vector fields which are not differential equations: in a sense, the coadjoint
orbit through the initial condition is too large.
