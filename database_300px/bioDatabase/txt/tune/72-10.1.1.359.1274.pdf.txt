ABSTRACT
PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a
public repository for biological properties of small
molecules hosted by the US National Institutes
of Health (NIH). PubChem BioAssay database cur-
rently contains biological test results for more than
700 000 compounds. The goal of PubChem is to
make this information easily accessible to biomed-
ical researchers. In this work, we present a set of
web servers to facilitate and optimize the utility of
biological activity information within PubChem.
These web-based services provide tools for rapid
data retrieval, integration and comparison of biolog-
ical screening results, exploratory structure–activity
analysis, and target selectivity examination. This
article reviews these bioactivity analysis tools and
discusses their uses. Most of the tools described
in this work can be directly accessed at http://
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/. URLs for acces-
sing other tools described in this work are specified
individually.
INTRODUCTION
PubChem (1) (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is an
open repository for chemical structures and their biologi-
cal test results. It was launched in September 2004 as part
of a research program under the NIH Molecular Libraries
Roadmap Initiative, which aimed to discover chemical
probes through high-throughput screening of small mole-
cules that modulate the activity of gene products (2,3).
PubChem contains three related databases: Substance,
Compound and BioAssay. The Substance database
(primary accession-SID) contains contributed sample
descriptions provided by depositors, whereas the
Compound database (primary accession-CID) contains
unique chemical structures derived from the substance
depositions. The PubChem BioAssay database (primary
accession-AID) contains bioactivity screens of chemical
substances described in PubChem, and serves as the
public repository for the biological screening results con-
tributed by the NIH Molecular Library Program (4,5),
other research organizations and industrial companies
(6–10). A BioAssay data entry contains contributed bio-
activity descriptions and test results, such as percentage of
activity inhibition, generated by one assay protocol.
About 30 academic institutions, government agencies,
research laboratories, as well as industrial assay vendors
have deposited biological test results, which were either
generated by HTS screenings or extracted from literature,
to the PubChem BioAssay repository. The PubChem
BioAssay database currently contains more than 1400
bioassay depositions and 45 millions of biological activity
outcomes for over 700 000 compounds of unique chemical
structures. With the accelerated growth of biological
screening results in both volume and complexity, the
need for computational tools to retrieve and analyze
such rich data becomes more imperative.
The goal of the PubChem BioAssay system is to provide
services to make the screening data of this large scale col-
lection easily accessible to the public, and provide
data analysis tools to facilitate the utilization of this val-
uable information. To this end, information content of
PubChem can be accessed through the NCBI Entrez
system. One can search, in Entrez’s PubChem
Compound database, a compound with a chemical syno-
nym, and subsequently link to a list of screening experi-
ments involving the given compound via the ‘BioAssays’
link (1). One can also ﬁnd, in Entrez’s PubChem BioAssay
database, all bioassay tests for a speciﬁc target by query-
ing the name of the protein target. The Entrez ‘Limits’
facility allows one to construct a speciﬁc query based on
one’s research need. Furthermore, PubChem provides a
set of web-based tools to integrate the chemical and bio-
logical activity information, and support the navigation
and in-depth data analysis that facilitates identiﬁcation
of chemical probes and biological interesting targets
contained within PubChem databases. For these tools,

PubChem implements a queuing mechanism to balance
web requests.
The BioAssay information system provides access
to review the deposited bioassay record in detail. It also
provides exploratory data analysis tools by using the
‘summary’ biological test results. Screening descriptions
and test results in PubChem BioAssay database are
diverse and assay-speciﬁc. PubChem allows depositions
of as many readouts as it needs to be, and provides
tools to search, select and retrieve such deposited informa-
tion. Despite this ﬂexibility, PubChem requires a summary
result for each tested chemical sample for deﬁning the
bioactivity outcome and bioactivity score. PubChem
bioactivity outcome summary includes ﬁve categories,
e.g. chemical probe, active, inactive, inconclusive and
unspeciﬁed. For the dose–response screening test, the pri-
mary endpoint, such as IC50, is denoted as ‘active con-
centration’ summary, and needs to be reported in
micromolar units. Such summary results allow one to clas-
sify and rank hits of a screening test. More importantly,
having a bioactivity outcome summary for each tested
sample allows PubChem to provide tools for rapid com-
parative analysis across multiple screening reports for
given chemical samples. PubChem has integrated the
bioactivity analysis tools (Figure 1) using these summary
results to provide a comprehensive review of biological
tests, compare biological activity data from multiple
screenings, and explore structure–activity relationship.
There are a number of publicly available databases
providing bioactivity information and data mining tools.
Among the well known resources, BindingDB (9),
IUPHAR (10) and PDBBind (11), focus on collecting
and curating bioactivity data from literature. ChemBank
(12) is a database for biological screening data generated
by HTS experiments. It provides cross-experiment analy-
sis through a heatmap visualization service; however, clas-
siﬁcation functionality has not been reported. GLIDA
(13) primarily focuses on the integration of information
between GPCRs and their ligands. It provides a useful
correlation map to facilitate the study of correlation pat-
terns between GPCR targets and their respective ligands
using a few distinct types of bioactivity information.
PubChem provides a similar structure–activity analysis
tool, yet it allows one to derive and compare activity pro-
ﬁle of the compound based on the quantitative bioactivity
data across a broad range of targets. Overall, the
PubChem bioactivity analysis services are clearly advan-
tageous in several respects. These services are seamlessly
integrated and allow users to set and reﬁne research focus
as needed to be in the process of data analysis. They lever-
age on the powerful facilities provided by the NCBI
Entrez system and allow one to utilize the information
relationship among the data content between PubChem
and other NCBI databases. Some other unique features
of the PubChem bioactivity analysis services include the
facilities supporting test result drill-down, registration-free
bulk download for screening results, structures of tested
chemicals, as well as similarity matrices used in various
data analysis. Multiple entry points are provided for
these services to support chemistry, bioassay or molecular
target centric analysis.
BioAssay SUMMARY
PubChem BioAssay Summary service (Figure 2) is the
primary service for presenting depositor-provided infor-
mation, represented by a PubChem BioAssay accession,
AID. This includes a summary of data attribution, assay
Figure 1. Common gateway of PubChem BioActivity Analysis Service. It provides a central entry point for accessing bioassay records, and tools
including BioAssay Summary, BioActivity Summary, Data Table and Structure–Activity Analysis. Files saved for recording analysis status can be
imported using the ‘Open Saved View’ tab.

description, experimental protocol, depositor comments,
screening outcome methodology and deﬁnitions of
reported readouts. It also includes depositor supplied
cross links to tested substance samples, hit compounds,
protein and gene target, PubMed publications, and other
information resources. Overall, it provides a comprehen-
sive description of a bioassay report, helps user to under-
stand the scientiﬁc goal of the experiment, the biological
background of the testing system, assay technology
exploited, discoveries made by the screening test, as well
as threshold used for deriving bioactivity outcome and
possible factors of artifacts. PubChem BioAssay database
tracks and archives each update of an assay submission.
This service enables one to review the update history of a
bioassay deposition by providing a list of the versions,
deposition date and modiﬁcation date. One may check
such information by clicking on the ‘+’ sign to the left
of AID and retrieve the information content for each
update by specifying the version ID using the ‘BioAssay
Version’ selection tool. Biological test results for the
active compounds can be accessed through the ‘Data
Table (Active)’ link, and those for all tested compounds
can be accessed through the ‘Data Table (All)’ link.
Another goal of the BioAssay Summary service is to
present annotations provided by PubChem. The assays
in the PubChem BioAssay database are related in many
ways, for example, through testing on biologically related
targets, reporting overlapped hits, or reporting counter
screening tests for the same assay project. Such assay rela-
tionships are identiﬁed and summarized through the links
under the ‘Related BioAssays’ section on the page.
Annotations for protein targets are provided by linking
to the protein classiﬁcation and known 3D protein struc-
ture resources at NCBI. Following the result from an
individual-screening experiment, this BioAssay Summary
service serves as a central entry point to evaluate the
screening results, discover further biological properties
of small molecules by using additional screening results
within PubChem, and begin analysis of active compounds
by allowing users to access various bioactivity analysis
tools using the links under the ‘BioActive Compounds’
section, including the BioActivity Summary tool and
Structure–Activity Analysis tool as described below. The
BioAssay Summary server can be accessed at http://pub-
chem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=, for each
PubChem BioAssay deposition by providing a valid

BioAssay records can be obtained at http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pcassay&term=all[ﬁlt].
BioActivity SUMMARY TOOL
The PubChem BioActivity Summary tool (Figure 3)
allows one to aggregate all available screening results,
and readily examine and compare biological outcomes
across multiple assays for one or more tested compounds
or substances. It reports and summarizes the available
screening bioactivity outcomes for a single or a set of
chemical samples. This service updates the screening
results, on a daily basis, with information from new bioas-
say depositions or updated results, and therefore provides
a comprehensive overview of the biological proﬁle
for tested small molecules using up-to-date screening
results within PubChem. Moreover, this service provides
functionalities to tailor the compounds and assays to a
focused data set that meets one’s research goal. It thus
oﬀers a platform for constructing a panel of assays and
compounds for further exploratory structure–activity
analysis and target selectivity evaluation by linking to
additional bioactivity analysis tools.
Depending on users’ goals, the summary of bioactivity
can be switched between compound-centric and sub-
stance-centric views. If centered on substance descriptions,
this particular tool provides a summary view of all avail-
able biological tests and the respective bioactivity outcome
contributed by a single organization. If the substances are
deposited by the MLSMR (NIH Molecular Libraries
Small Molecule Repository), they can be tested by multi-
ple screening centers within the NIH Molecular Library
Program. If centered on compound descriptions, the ser-
vice provides a comprehensive summary view of biological
activity by aggregating all screening data across multiple
Figure 3. A view of BioActivity Summary analysis for the 10 compounds active in the secondary assay ‘Cathepsin B Inhibitor Series SAR Study’
(AID 523). This analysis shows that these compounds are tested in several hundreds of screening experiments, and some compounds are considered
active in other biological tests as well. A further analysis by revising the assay focus using the ‘Select Active’ tool will tell the number of assays
having one or multiple hits overlapping with those in AID 523. To review compounds and the test results from the ‘HTS to identify Inhibitors of
West Nile Virus’ assay, AID 577, for example, one may click on ‘6’ shown under the ‘Active’ column to retrieve assay results given in AID 577 for
the six compounds which are considered active in that assay. Alternatively, one may select assays using the check box on left of AID, and invoke the
‘Data Table’ tab to retrieve test results from the selected assays.
W626 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37,Web Server issue
contributors for the unique chemical structures. Given the
diﬀerence in scope between compounds and substances,
we will consider only the case of compounds in more
detail below.
The BioActivity Summary tool can be invoked from
any BioAssay Summary page. In this case, the active com-
pounds of the bioassay will become the default focus. For
example, in the ‘Cathepsin B inhibitor Series SAR Study’
assay, AID 523(http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/
assay.cgi?aid=523), 10 compounds are identiﬁed as
potential cathepsin B inhibitors (Figure 2). One may per-
form the BioActivity Summary analysis for the active
compounds using the ‘BioActivity Summary’ link under
the ‘BioActive Compounds’ section (Figure 2). The result
of such analysis is shown in Figure 3. These 10 active
compounds are tested in over 300 assays, deposited in
PubChem at the time of this writing, including AID 523.
In the summary table, assays are sorted by the count of
active compounds. Each assay is summarized, one per
line, with the count of active, inactive and tested com-
pounds. The assay name, bioactivity outcome method
type, e.g. primary versus conﬁrmatory, and protein
target speciﬁcation give a summary of what screenings
are performed for the compounds under analysis. More
importantly, one can see that some of the compounds that
are active in AID 523 also show activity in a number of
other assays. The conﬁrmatory assays ranked near the top
of the table include assay targets from several other pro-
tease-related proteins, such as West Nile Virus NS2bNS3
proteinase, Factor XIa, kallikrein-related peptidase 5,
Cathepsin G and Factor XIIa. This suggests that some
of these 10 compounds are nonspeciﬁc inhibitors for the
Cathepsin B target and demonstrate cross reactivity
against a group of biologically related proteins.
The BioActivity Summary service provides several pow-
erful selection-revise features that enable one to rapidly
revise the focus of the analysis by modifying the set of
selected compounds and assays. As depicted in Figure 3,
one may choose to expand the current set of compounds
to include all tested compounds or active compounds
within a given set of bioassays, or expand the compounds
to include those having similar 2D structures to the ones
in the current set. Alternatively, one may choose to limit
the compounds to only those found active in the assay
subset. Similarly, the selected assay set can be expanded
to include those that are active or tested for a given
set of compounds. Additionally, bioassays with similar
bioactivity proﬁles and bioassays with similar protein
target sequence can be added to selection. For example,
to focus on a subset of the input compounds that are
active in one or more of the selected assays, user would
click the ‘Select Active’ link in the ‘Revise Compound
Selection’ section to exclude the less interesting com-
pounds, or to explore additional assay screens where
the given compounds are considered active by using
the ‘Add Active’ link in the ‘Revise BioAssay Selection’
section. One may also choose to focus on conﬁrmatory
assays or assays with speciﬁc molecular targets using
the ﬁltering features provided in the ‘Other Filters’
pop-up menu.
One of the common entry points for accessing the
BioActivity Summary tool is from a single PubChem com-
pound summary record. Invoking the BioActivity
Summary tool from a compound summary record will
readily generate an overview of all biological screenings
performed for that compound. From the BioActivity
Summary page users can expand the analysis by including
compound similar in 2D chemical structures via ‘Add
Similar Compounds’ link in the ‘Revise Compound
Selection’ section. This operation adds compounds
with signiﬁcant 2D structural similarity and allows users
to collect and examine the bioactivity data among tested
analogs. A further request of all bioassays tested for the
analog series using the ‘Add Tested’ link in the ‘Revise
BioAssay Selection’ section may reveal additional impor-
tant screenings where the structural analogs are tested.
Subsequent analysis using the Structure–Activity
Analysis tool (to be described) enables further evalua-
tion on the SAR and bioactivity proﬁle of such analog
series.
Other entry points include NCBI Entrez ‘DocSum’
reports for PubChem substance, compound and bioassay
records, where the BioActivity Summary tool can be
invoked for each individual record as well as for the
entire data set resulted from an Entrez search. This can
be done by using the explicit ‘BioActivity Analysis’ link,
or clicking the double six-member ring icon from the
‘Tools’ area. For example, one may start, in Entrez’s
PubChem Compound database, with a compound sub-
mitted to PubChem by a journal article reporting speciﬁc
enzyme inhibitors. To verify the discussed inhibition activ-
ity of the enzyme inhibitor, one can compare the reported
bioactivity information to the biological tests deposited
in PubChem. Alternatively, one may start a structure
search with a given substructure using the service pro-
vided at http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/search
.cgi, and launch the BioActivity Summary tool for the
resulting compound set to the link described above. In
another case, one may search PubChem BioAssay data-
base for all available screening tests for a particular target,
then use the BioActivity Summary tool to examine the
bioactivity outcomes from each screening experiment,
compare the hit list and compile a library of bioactive
compounds for the target. Users can also choose to
access this analysis tool through the common gateway of
PubChem BioActivity Analysis Service provided
at: http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?p=
bioactivity. From this entry point, the dataset of assay,
substance/compound, which are subject to the analysis,
can be speciﬁed by entering an ID list, providing a text
ﬁle contains the IDs (comma separated, or one ID per
line), or referring to an Entrez search history. This entry
point provides the ﬂexibility to focus the analysis on a well
deﬁned compound and assay dataset, for example, to eval-
uate the toxicity properties for the compounds of one’s
interest using only toxicity proﬁling assays available at
PubChem. In the case that only compound input is speci-
ﬁed, a summary for all available biological test results will
be provided.
In addition to providing a bioactivity overview, this ser-
vice serves as the starting point in the bioactivity analysis
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, Web Server issue W627
process, which leads users to further analysis using
the Structure–Activity Analysis tool and Data Table tool
which will be described in the following sections.
PubChem Data Table tool supports the retrieval of
assay data from multiple depositions. Prior to such ana-
lysis, multiple assays can be speciﬁed using the checkbox
on the page provided with the BioActivity Summary tool.
The results of the BioActivity Summary analysis are saved
on a temporary server, and will be available only for a
limited period of time, usually 48 hours. The status of
this analysis, however, can be saved through the ‘Save
View’ feature to facilitate scientiﬁc communication.
Analysis can be resumed by importing the status ﬁle
through the web server at http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.-
gov/assay/assay.cgi?p=qﬁle under the common gateway
of PubChem BioActivity Analysis Service.
Overall, the BioActivity Summary service aims to pro-
vide insights into the activity proﬁle of the compounds
using multiple screening test results, and oﬀer an eﬃcient
platform to deﬁne and collect an interesting set of com-
pounds and panel of assays to perform further analysis.
STRUCTURE–ACTIVITY ANALYSIS TOOL
The Structure–Activity Analysis tool (Figure 4) allows one
to perform exploratory analysis by simultaneously cluster-
ing compound and assay information using a single link-
age clustering methodology (14). The Structure–Activity
Analysis Tool is designed to help rapidly identify interest-
ing subsets of compounds and bioassays using various
similarity concepts. It enables users to compare and con-
trast screening results by bioactivity proﬁle or assay target
Figure 4. Screen shot of PubChem structure-activity analysis for the 10 active compounds in AID 523 and several conﬁrmatory assays against a few
protein targets. Assay clusters, based on assay target sequence similarity, are shown in the horizontal dimension, while compound clusters, based on
2D structure similarity, are shown in the vertical dimension. Each cell in the heatmap is colored based on the reported active concentration value
(e.g. IC50) according to the legend contained within the ﬁgure. The PubChem Compound accession, e.g. CID, is shown to the right of each leaf of
the compound cluster dendrogram. A chemical structure display can be invoked upon mouse-over the respective CID. PubChem BioAssay accession,
e.g. AID, is shown beneath each leaf of the assay cluster dendrogram, while GI numbers for the respective assay targets are provided below the
heatmap and hyperlinked to the corresponding Entrez protein records.
W628 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37,Web Server issue
similarity, or analyze the activity of compound analog
series in a panel of assays to identify SAR if any, and to
suggest structure features critical for improving biological
activity potency.
The results are presented through the use of an inter-
active heatmap display. With this web-based service, a
group of compounds and assays may be clustered using
various means. Chemical structures may be clustered
based on 2D structure similarity (as measured by
Tanimoto score using the PubChem dictionary-based
ﬁngerprint [ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/speciﬁca
tions/pubchem_ﬁngerprints.txt]) or biological response,
as measured by reported bioactivity outcome, bioactivity
score, or active concentration (e.g. IC50, EC50, AC50,
etc.). Assays can be clustered based on similarity in bio-
logical response of the compound set, similarity in
sequence of assay targets, or similarity provided by
depositors. Some of the similarity data (e.g. protein
target similarity) are pre-computed to obtain optimal ana-
lysis performance.
‘Revise Selection’ features, similarly to those in the
BioActivity Summary tool, are provided to deﬁne and
modify the focus of the analysis. These features can be
accessed by clicking on the ‘+’ sign shown on the left of
the Revise Selection section (Figure 4). Furthermore, facil-
ities for further analyzing the clustering results and navi-
gating between various PubChem tools, including the
Entrez search system, are provided and may be accessed
throughout the heatmap display. For example, as shown
in Figure 4, in the dendrogram display, one may click on a
blue circle attached to a node of a compound cluster to
invoke a feature menu, and to display the sub-tree, prune
the sub-tree, or add compounds similar to those contained
in a sub-tree. Users can also retrieve chemical structure
similarity score matrix used in the clustering and send the
selected compounds to one of PubChem tools or to Entrez
system. Using similar functionalities associated with
assay cluster, one may retrieve assay target similarity
score matrix, or revise assay selection to include the var-
ious types of related bioassays. Users can also perform a
number of operations on a combined group of assays and
compounds. To deﬁne such a subset, one can zoom in the
heatmap display by clicking on two cells in the heatmap.
The operations available include sending the compounds
in the sub-cluster to the ‘Structure Clustering’ service to
visualize the chemical structure classes, sending assays, or
compounds to the Entrez system to, for example, check
the availability of protein 3D structure complex or look
for information on biological mechanism using linked
PubMed articles, etc. Using this feature, one can further
compare multiple test results in details by retrieving all
readouts using the Data Table tool (to be described).
A common entry point for the Structure–Activity
Analysis service is from the previously described
BioActivity Summary service, which can be used to
narrow down the compound and assay set, thus to prepare
an appropriate input for the SAR study. This tool can also
be accessed from the BioAssay Summary service for a
given bioassay record to analyze the set of active com-
pounds in a single assay through identiﬁcation of chemical
structure clusters that exhibit similar biological response.
In this particular application, one may want to take
advantage of the integrated tools to further expand the
assay scope, for example, to combine the screening results
for related targets using the ‘Add Related BioAssays’
functionality provided in the Revise Selection section,
and attempt to search compounds demonstrating high
selectivity towards a particular target. This service can
be also accessed through the common gateway of the
PubChem BioActivity Analysis Service at http://pub
chem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?p=heat, where
assays, substances or compounds can be ﬂexibly speciﬁed
based on one’s research need.
Results from such structure–activity analysis, including
image, data table and similarity matrix can be exported
in respective formats including the Graph Modelling
Language format for the dendrograms. Similarly to the
BioActivity Summary service, the results of this analysis
are saved temporarily, and can be accessed for only a
limited period of time, usually 48 hours. Users can use
the ‘Save View’ button to save the analysis in a status
ﬁle and use this ﬁle to communicate the results with
collaborators, who can open the status ﬁle at http://pub
chem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?p=qﬁle to see the
exact same analysis page at a later time.
An example to illustrate the usage for this Structure–
Activity Analysis Tool is shown in Figure 4, which demon-
strates how this tool allows chemists and biologists to
easily access and combine related screening data for iden-
tiﬁcation of potential chemical probes with desired SAR
property and target selectivity. To start the analysis, com-
pounds active in AID 523 and a few conﬁrmatory assays
are selected from the BioActivity Summary table as shown
in Figure 3. Each of the selected assays has a speciﬁed
protein target. In this particular analysis, compounds are
clustered based on 2D structure similarity and assays
are clustered based on target sequence similarity. Each
cell is colored according to the reported potency of
the compound in the corresponding assay. The heatmap
presentation allows one to identify instantly a cluster
of compounds that demonstrate interesting SAR.
Meanwhile, this analysis allows one to examine the selec-
tivity and target speciﬁcity of the compounds by compar-
ing the biological responses against a series of related
targets.
DATA TABLE TOOL
The Data Table tool supports rapid search and retrieval of
test results for a single or multiple assay records. It is
integrated with the BioActivity Summary and Structure–
Activity Analysis services. It also links to the Test Result
Select tool, Histogram tool and Scatter Plot tool (to be
described) when analyzing results for a single assay record.
Assay data retrieval, particularly for multiple bioassay
depositions simultaneously, can be time consuming. This
service implements a queuing and caching mechanism to
optimize the web server performance.
Test results are shown in tabular format (Figure 5).
Each row in the data table displays a chemical structure,
SID, CID, bioactivity outcome, score and associated assay
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, Web Server issue W629
readouts. Bioactivity outcome is highlighted using icon
(rectangle shape), with ‘active’ outcome colored in red
and ‘inactive’ outcome colored in blue. Each CID is
linked to the respective PubChem compound summary
server, while SID(s), which can be multiple with the
merged data presentation from the ‘compound view’ (see
description below), is linked to the substance ‘DocSum’
report in Entrez. Cross references for a speciﬁc test result,
such as the GenBank accession number for the protein
target of a compound, or PubMed ID of an article
where the activity information is extracted, can be
reported along with assay readouts in the data table.
In such case, they are hyperlinked to the respective
Entrez records.
‘Concise Data’ view, including bioactivity outcome,
score and active concentration if provided, is shown
in the data table as the default for rapid review, while
complete results including all provided readouts can
be obtained upon request using the ‘Data Table,
Complete’ link. Data table can be sorted ﬂexibly based
on SID/CID, bioactivity score, or a user-selected readout.
Data table can be paginated vertically for navigating the
test results for diﬀerent chemical samples, and can be pagi-
nated horizontally in the case of multiple assay data retrie-
val, for navigating the test results from diﬀerent bioassay
depositions. These features are necessary to support the
analysis of screening results within PubChem, which
sometimes contain hundreds of thousands of chemical
samples, and a few hundreds of readout ﬁelds.
Assay results can be downloaded in multiple formats
including CSV, XML and ASN.1. Chemical structure
data can be downloaded as SD ﬁles, as well as in many
other data formats, such as SMILES, InCHI, XML and
ASN.1. Given the large data volume, when downloading
test results simultaneously for multiple bioassay records,
only the data ﬁelds explicitly shown on the current
data table can be downloaded at each time. The
PubChem BioAssay system currently supports the retrie-
val and display of readout ﬁelds for up to 20 assay records
at one time. If users want to request the next 20 bioassay
records, they can use the pagination functionality to
retrieve and download additional test results. No such
limitation is set for data rows, e.g. this service allows
downloading all shown test result ﬁelds for the entire set
of chemical samples.
Data table can be presented in various ways with mul-
tiple assay results depending on the speciﬁed view focus.
Each test result in PubChem BioAssay is associated with
a substance sample, represented as a SID unique to the
assay depositor. For chemicals with identical structures,
test results provided by diﬀerent depositors are associated
with distinct SIDs (with results from NIH MLP program
as an exception). This happens sometimes even within
the data from the same depositor when samples of such
Figure 5. Concise view of data table for multiple screening test results. The compound centric view merges test results from multiple bioassay
depositions, and as a result, one CID may point to multiple SID. Bioactivity outcomes are presented using graphical icons, with ‘active’ results
represented with icon colored in red. Complete assay results can be obtained through the ‘Data Table, Complete’ link. One may access additional
data analysis tools using the provided links. One may also save the results or analysis status using the features provided in this page (not shown).

chemicals are provided in diﬀerent batches and as such
submitted to PubChem as diﬀerent substance records.
As a result, the ‘substance view’, which can be selected
using the ‘Group Results by: substance’ feature under
the ‘Result Display Option’ section provided on the
page, would present these data points on separate rows
in the data table display, with each one associated with the
respective SID. The ‘compound view’, however, would
merge and associate the test results with the respective
unique chemical structure, represented as a CID, and as
a result, data points from multiple tests would be pre-
sented on the same row. Furthermore, compound libraries
supplied by diﬀerent data source may not encode struc-
tures identically. Similar functionalities are developed to
merge or collapse test results based on chemical structure
associations, such as based on the ‘same parent’ associa-
tion among molecules with diﬀerent salt forms, or based
on the ‘same connectivity’ association for molecules
having the same connectivity but with mixed stereo infor-
mation. Conceivably, such functionality may help in gen-
eral to obtain comprehensive activity proﬁle for closely
related chemical structures.
TEST RESULT SELECT TOOL
The Test Result Select tool can be accessed at http://
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?q=t&aid=,
for each PubChem Bioassay deposition by providing a
valid accession number, e.g. AID. It is also linked from
the data table page. This service allows one to search and
select assay readouts, ﬁlter chemical substances/com-
pounds by bioactivity outcome, bioactivity score or
active concentration. It lets one specify readout ﬁelds to
be displayed in data table. It also allows one to request the
most recent or all versions of test results within an assay
record. This service utilizes NCBI Entrez Eutils facility,
communicates with Entrez history system, and enables
one to retrieve test results for the compounds obtained
from a speciﬁc Entrez search. These features provide
means for drilling down and partitioning assay test results,
which facilitates to rapidly identify chemicals with desired
biological property, reduce the data set under investiga-
tion to manageable sizes, and make it suitable for subse-
quent in-depth analysis. Such functionalities also allow
one to deﬁne ‘active’ compounds on the ﬂy by setting
the desired threshold on screening results from one or
multiple assays and derive a focused data set prior to
analysis with other bioactivity analysis tools.
HISTOGRAM AND SCATTER PLOT TOOL
Histogram Plot and Scatter Plot tools can be accessed
at http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?q=
p&aid=, for each PubChem Bioassay deposition by pro-
viding a valid accession number, e.g. AID. They are also
linked from the data table page. These tools enable pre-
liminary data analysis using numerical readouts from
one assay. Plots are displayed with results of diﬀerent
types of bioactivity outcome labeled with distinct colors
and symbols. Interactive functionalities are built in these
tools which allow one to identify interesting subset of
compounds, and perform subsequent analysis by zoom-
ing in the subset or linking to data table. These tools
may help PubChem users to evaluate activity threshold,
examine distribution of the selected activity readout, and
provide an alternative, yet more powerful means for iden-
tifying biological interesting chemicals and drilling down
test results. Further development for these tools will
enable them to support analysis across multiple screening
results.
BLAST SEARCH TOOL
A specialized BLAST service is developed at NCBI by
integrating the molecular target information in
PubChem BioAssay database with BLAST (15) search
tool. This service enables one to search assay targets and
link to the biological test results contained in PubChem.
To this end, protein targets in PubChem BioAssay data-
base are composed as a BLAST search database. This
service can be accessed using the link, ‘Search protein or
nucleotide targets in PubChem BioAssay’, on the BLAST
home page (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) under
the ‘Specialized BLAST’ section. The BLAST service for
protein bioassay target search takes a protein sequence
submission, by a GenBank accession, GI number, an
amino acid sequence in FASTA format, as well as a
UniProt accession, and performs a sequence similarity
comparison against the protein sequence identity group
of each of the available protein targets within the
PubChem BioAssay database. PubChem annotates
screening results with molecular targets and provides
cross links to GenBank protein records whenever possible.
This new BLAST service utilizes such annotations, facil-
itates the search of biological targets and their small mol-
ecule ligands within PubChem, and provides an additional
path for biologists to discover the screening results and
chemical probes contained in PubChem. BLAST server
now further annotates the BLAST search results, it high-
lights the proteins for which biological screening data are
available at PubChem and directs users to the respective
bioassay records for each particular target (Figure 6).
PubChem allows the deposition of bioassay with nucleo-
tide target as well. PubChem currently contains only a
few data entries with RNAi screening test results,
but anticipates more screening data targeting on genes
by collaborating with organizations involved with RNAi
screening research including the RNAi Global Initiative
Consortium.
CONCLUSION
PubChem provides a set of web servers for accessing,
retrieving and analyzing biological test results archived
in PubChem databases. BioAssay database grows rapidly
with the contribution of the on-going NIH Molecular
Library Program and many organizations supporting
open access. PubChem BioAssay system has made con-
tinuously progress by expanding and optimizing data
retrieval and analysis utilities. These PubChem BioAssay
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, Web Server issue W631
utilities will be further enhanced towards two directions:
develop additional methods to support data analysis and
scale up the system for eﬃcient management of the growth
of information content and diversity.
