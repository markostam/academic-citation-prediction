The understanding of dengue virus pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of in vitro and in vivo
models of disease. The study of viral factors involved in the production of severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF), versus the more common dengue fever (DF), have been limited to indirect clinical and epidemi-
ologic associations. In an effort to identify viral determinants of DHF, we have developed a method for
comparing dengue type 2 genomes (reverse transcriptase PCR in six fragments) directly from patient plasma.
Samples for comparison were selected from two previously described dengue type 2 genotypes which had been
shown to be the cause of DF or DHF. When full genome sequences of 11 dengue viruses were analyzed, several
structural differences were seen consistently between those associated with DF only and those with the potential
to cause DHF: a total of six encoded amino acid charge differences were seen in the prM, E, NS4b, and NS5
genes, while sequence differences observed within the 5* nontranslated region (NTR) and 3* NTR were
predicted to change RNA secondary structures. We hypothesize that the primary determinants of DHF reside
in (i) amino acid 390 of the E protein, which purportedly alters virion binding to host cells; (ii) in the
downstream loop (nucleotides 68 to 80) of the 5* NTR, which may be involved in translation initiation; and (iii)
in the upstream 300 nucleotides of the 3* NTR, which may regulate viral replication via the formation of
replicative intermediates. The significance of four amino acid differences in the nonstructural proteins NS4b
and NS5, a presumed transport protein and the viral RNA polymerase, respectively, remains unknown. This
new approach to the study of dengue virus genome differences should better reflect the true composition of viral
RNA populations in the natural host and permit their association with pathogenesis.
Due to the global growth of populations, urbanization, and
the spread of the main mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, dengue
diseases are a major, emerging problem with the cocirculation
of different virus serotypes, increased frequency of epidemics,
and the introduction of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in
areas where it was not previously known. At present, it is
estimated that more than 50 million human dengue infections
occur annually and that, since 1958, more than 60,000 children
have died due to DHF (24).
Dengue viruses, which belong to the genus Flavivirus (family
Flaviviridae), have four distinct antigenic types (serotypes 1 to
4). Dengue virus infections can be subclinical or cause illnesses
ranging from a mild, flu-like syndrome with rash (dengue fever
[DF]) to a severe and sometimes fatal disease, characterized by
capillary leakage, thrombocytopenia, and sometimes hypovo-
lemic shock (DHF). However, due to the lack of in vivo and in
vitro correlates of virulence, the precise mechanism(s) by
which dengue viruses cause severe disease is still not under-
stood. It has been shown by epidemiologic and clinical associ-
ations that both immunologic and viral factors determine the
severity of disease (26, 62). Infection with one dengue virus
serotype does not provide protective immunity against the
others, and sequential (heterotypic) infection has been shown
to increase virus replication and thus the probability of devel-
oping DHF by a process known as antibody-dependent en-
hancement (25, 39). Host immune factors, such as cytokines,
interferon, and activated complement have been suggested to
increase the capillary permeability, the hallmark of DHF (41).
Recent events in this hemisphere suggest the importance of
viral factors. Despite cocirculation of several dengue serotypes
in the Americas, it was not until the Cuban epidemic of 1981
that the first DHF cases occurred, and this coincided with the
introduction of a new genetic type of dengue virus serotype 2
(DEN-2) (58). Phylogenetic studies demonstrate different ge-
netic types of DEN-2; the “native” American genotype has
been associated thus far with mild disease (DF), while the
introduced Southeast Asian genotype coincided with the ap-
pearance of DHF in four different countries (60). Other sup-
port comes from epidemiologic studies in Peru, where over a
period of 4 years (1993 to 1997), active surveillance for DF
cases revealed that, in spite of secondary infection rates of up
to 75%, no DHF cases have been detected; this country has not
yet imported the Southeast Asian genotype of DEN-2 (70).
Our search for viral factors of severe disease has therefore
focused on DEN-2 viruses.
As with other flaviviruses, the dengue virus RNA genome is
a single-stranded positive-sense genome of approximately
10,700 bases in length, surrounded by a nucleocapsid and cov-
ered by a lipid envelope containing the envelope and the mem-
brane proteins. The genome contains a single open reading
frame, which encodes a precursor polyprotein and is flanked by
two nontranslated regions (59 and 39 NTR). Co- and posttrans-
lational proteolytic cleavage of the precursor results in the

formation of three structural proteins, capsid (C), membrane
(M), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins, NS1,
NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 (8). For other flavi-
viruses, including yellow fever (33), Japanese encephalitis (7,
27), Murray Valley (43), Louping ill (34), and tick-borne en-
cephalitis (TBE) (29) viruses, most molecular markers for
pathogenicity have been localized in the E gene. For dengue,
several studies of cloned or cell culture-passaged wild and
attenuated viruses have been performed, but each report de-
scribed different sites of nucleotide and amino acid changes
possibly associated with virulence (3, 38, 48–50, 53). Most of
these studies suggested that sites in the prM, E, NS1, and NS3
genes or the NTRs are of importance. Since studies relating
markers such as mouse neurovirulence, cell culture growth
characteristics, and immunogenicity in mice are of limited
value in assessing human disease potential, the viral determi-
nants of severe dengue are still unclear. We have determined
the full nucleotide sequences of 11 viruses directly from clinical
samples from DF and DHF patients in Thailand and the
Americas in an attempt to define genome structural differences
that might be correlated with pathogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Viruses. DEN-2 viruses were obtained from acute-phase plasma collected
from patients enrolled in ongoing prospective clinical studies (Thailand) (35, 59)
or epidemiologic surveillance programs (Venezuela, Mexico, and Peru) during
1981 to 1997. Sample aliquots were used to infect C6/36 mosquito cells and were
identified as DEN-2 by indirect fluorescent antibody tests with type-specific
monoclonal antibodies. Virus titers were determined for the Thai plasma samples
by mosquito probit analysis (16), based on 10-fold dilutions: 20 Toxorhynchites
splendens mosquitoes were injected per plasma dilution, and indirect fluorescent
antibody testing was performed with 15 of the survivors (69). Mosquito-infec-
tious doses per milliliter ranged between 6.9 and 8.55 log10. Virus isolation and
passage histories of samples used in this study and previously published strains
(16681, NGC, 1409, PR159S1, ThNHp7, and ThNH11) used for comparison are
given in Table 1.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 200 to 500 ml of
plasma or cell culture supernatant by using Trizol LS (GIBCO BRL, Gaithers-
burg, Md.) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Ethanol-precip-
itated RNA was recovered by centrifugation and air-dried. The RNA pellet was
resuspended in 35 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) and
used as a template in reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Synthetic oligonu-
cleotide primer pairs were designed based on published sequence data for strains
16681, New Guinea C, Jamaica 1409, and PR159S1 and were optimized over the
course of the study to generate six overlapping double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
products spanning genome nucleotide (nt) regions 11 to 681, 618 to 2602, 2406
to 6342 (or 2409 to 5751), 5442 to 7522, 7476 to 10322 (or 7243 to 10327), and
9948 to 10695. Diagrams of the genome amplification and sequencing strategies
are shown in Fig. 1.
To amplify each fragment, a mixture of 5 ml of RNA, 50 pM of corresponding
sense and antisense PCR primers, and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (to a
total volume of 50 ml) was incubated at 85°C for 5 min and chilled on ice. A

Branchburg, N.J.), 200 mM each deoxynucleotide, 1.1 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 mM
dithiothreitol, 40 U of RNasin, 10 U of avian myeloblastosis virus RT (Promega,
Madison, Wis.), and 3 U of rTth DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) was added.
The reverse transcription reaction was performed at 42°C for 60 min. Thermo-
cycling began with a “hot start” at 94°C for 2 min, and the PCR conditions (30
cycles) differed according to primer pair characteristics and the expected frag-
ment size. Oligonucleotide primers used for amplification (RT-PCR) and the
respective thermocycling conditions are given in Table 2. Extension times were
increased for the last 20 cycles by 10 s/cycle, and a final extension was performed
at 72°C for 15 min. Reaction mixtures were stored at 4°C until further processing.
Sequencing of PCR fragments. For automated sequencing, spin column-puri-
fied (Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.) dsDNA fragments were analyzed by the cycle-
sequencing dye terminator method. The Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) was
chosen because it contains high-sensitivity dye and a variant of Thermus aquati-
cus DNA polymerase that has no 59339 exonuclease activity. For each sequenc-
ing reaction, approximately 50 to 100 ng purified DNA was combined with 3.2
pmol of primer and a reaction cocktail containing the four dye-labeled
dideoxynucleotide terminators. Cycle sequencing parameters used were as de-
scribed in the manufacturer’s protocol (25 cycles of 96°C for 30 s, 50°C for 60 s,
and 60°C for 4 min). The reaction mixture was column purified (Centri-Sep,
Princeton Separations, Adelfia, N.J.), and the DNA was dried in a vacuum
centrifuge for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 16-ml of template suppres-
sion reagent, heated for 2 min at 95°C, and kept on ice until loaded on the
sequencer, an Applied Biosystems Prism 310, by using a short capillary (47 cm by
50 mm [inside diameter]) and Performance Optimized Polymer 6 (Perkin-Elmer,
Applied Biosystems).
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis. Overlapping nucleic acid se-
quences were combined for analysis and edited with the aid of the Lasergene
software package (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.). Prior to phylogenetic anal-
ysis, DEN-2 virus nucleic acid sequences were aligned with the DEN-2 strain
16681 virus by using the multiple sequence alignment methods CLUSTAL and
JOTUN-HEIN, within the MEGALIGN program (DNASTAR, Inc.). With our
protocol, we were able to determine up to 10,666 nt of the entire DEN-2 genome,
encoding a polyprotein of 3,391 amino acids (aa). Due to the small quantities of
viral RNA contained in the human plasma samples, we were not able to deter-
mine the 11 nt at the 59 end and 47 nt at the 39 end; here, we have assumed that
these regions are conserved and identical to those in virus strain 16681 (38). The
predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed by using algorithms within the
PROTEAN software package (DNASTAR, Inc.): Chou-Fasman (10) and Gar-
nier-Robson (19) for secondary structure predictions, Kyte-Doolittle (42) for
hydropathy prediction, and Jameson-Wolf (32) and Hopp-Woods (30) for pre-
diction of potential antigenic determinants.
Nucleotide and amino acid mutation rates. To obtain nucleotide and amino
acid mutation rates for the DEN-2 genome, we used data from Thai samples.
The total number of nucleotide and amino acid changes of each of the two
samples from year 1994 were compared to those of each of the two samples from
1995. The differences were averaged and divided by the total lengths of the
genome and polyprotein, respectively. This procedure was repeated with data
from samples collected in 1995 and 1996. The nucleotide and amino acid muta-
tion rate for the observed 2-year period (1994 to 1996) resulted from the average
of the rates obtained for each year.
Phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses were done with the PAUP* pro-
gram, with uniform character weights, TBR branch swapping, and a heuristic
search for the most parsimonious trees (68). Sequences from representatives of
the other three serotypes (1, 2, and 4) (18, 52, 74) were used to root the trees.
The reliability of the inferred phylogenetic tree was estimated by the bootstrap
method, with 100 replications (15).
Secondary structure analysis of the NTRs. RNA secondary structure predic-
tions of the 59 and 39 NTRs were performed with the mfold (75) and the
RNASTAR (22) programs. The latter simulates the RNA folding process, using
a genetic algorithm, and can predict tertiary structures such as pseudoknots,
while the former does not. The resulting predicted folding patterns were graph-
ically represented with the loopDloop program (20). The RNASTAR-generated
secondary structures were compared by the RNAdistance program (64) of the
Vienna RNA package (28), and the resulting distance matrix was analyzed with
PAUP* (68) by using the distance optimality criterion and heuristic search
settings. Phylogenetic trees reflecting the relationship between the predicted
RNA secondary structures were then compared to those generated by compar-
ison of full genome nucleotide sequences.
Secondary structure analysis of the 39 NTR was performed with a total of 19
DEN-2 virus nucleotide sequences. To determine the consistency of the pre-
dicted RNA structures and to investigate the possible influence of cell culture
passage on these structures, we included eight additional viruses from the Amer-
icas: four unpassaged samples (Mara10, 102692, 383, and 926) and four low-
passage strains (1318, 044, 348600, and 0147), obtained from both DF and DHF
patients (Table 1).

RESULTS
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities between all
samples and previously published strains 16681, ThNH7,
ThNHp11, NGC, PR159S1, and 1409 are shown in a matrix
(Table 3).
Southeast Asian genotype sequence analysis. Analysis of six
Thai viruses revealed nucleotide and amino acid sequence
similarities of 98.1 to 99.6% and 99.4 to 99.9%, respectively;
nucleotide similarities to a 1964 Thai isolate, strain 16681,
ranged from 96.6 to 96.8%. This suggests that, during a 30-year
period in Thailand, the prevalent DEN-2 virus population has
fixed up to only 3.4% mutations. However, based on samples
taken during the period we observed, 1994 to 1996, the muta-
tion rate per year was 1.5%, which is much higher than was

observed for other dengue virus serotypes (e.g., 0.12 to 0.14%
per year for DEN-3) (11). It could be that because we are not
passaging virus after patient sampling, we are seeing the actual
distribution of virus variants, with a concomitant rise in ob-
served mutations (i.e., no population selection due to cell cul-
ture or other propagation). Amino acid variation was 0.5% per
year, or one-third of that of nucleotides, suggesting that nu-
cleotide variation was selective, with a preference for the third
codon position. Nucleotide sequence variation was present as
single-base substitutions scattered throughout the entire length
of the genome, except for the 59 NTR, which was identical to
the 59 NTR of reference strain 16681. No nucleotide deletions
or insertions were detected within the coding region, although
within the 39 NTR, all Thai samples except CO390 show an
insertion at position 10392, bringing their total genome length
to 10,724 bases (versus 10,723 bases for strain 16681). The
majority of nucleotide substitutions occurred at third codon
positions, and, overall, only 6.9 to 16.3% of the nucleic acid
changes resulted in amino acid changes. Analysis of the pre-
dicted polyprotein revealed that amino acid substitutions oc-
curred throughout the coding region, with the majority (23 of
28) in the nonstructural proteins. None of these were consis-
tent among DF or DHF samples and could not be correlated
with disease outcome. Within the structural region, the C and
prM genes were conserved for all samples except CO390 (2 aa
differences in C-305 and C-309, and 1 aa difference in prM-16).
When comparing the six Thai samples as a group, the numbers
of amino acid differences among them per gene were as fol-
lows: C, 2 of 114 (1.75%); prM, 1 of 91 (1.10%); M, 0 of 75; E,
2 of 495 (0.40%); NS1, 6 of 352 (1.70%); NS2a, 7 of 281
(3.21%); NS2b, 0 of 130; NS3, 4 of 618 (0.65%); NS4a, 2 of 150
(1.33%); NS4b, 2 of 248 (0.81%); and NS5, 2 of 900 (0.22%).
American genotype sequence analysis. The samples repre-
senting the American genotype had nucleotide and amino acid
sequence similarities ranging from 97.8 to 98.5% and 99.1 to
99.4%, respectively. Within the entire coding area, no nucleo-
tide deletions or insertions were observed. However, within the
59 NTR, both Peruvian samples (IQT1797 and IQT2913) had
a deletion at position 76, and within the 39 NTR, all samples
had deletions at positions 10276 to 10283 (8 nt), 10299, and
10388, bringing their total genome length to 10,712 bases. A
nucleotide insertion was seen at position 10612 in both Peru-
vian samples. As in the Thai samples, the majority of nucleo-
tide differences were single-base substitutions, occurring in the
third position of the codons; only 10.36 to 12.42% of the
nucleic acid changes resulted in amino acid changes. When
comparing the five samples as a group, the numbers of amino
acid differences among them per gene were as follows: C, 0 of

Comparison of two genotypes. Because the sequence analy-
sis of the Southeast Asian genotype viruses did not reveal any
specific changes consistently correlated with disease outcome
and their hydrophilicity profiles, calculated by the method of
Kyte and Doolittle (42), were virtually superimposable, we
compared the Southeast Asian genotype viruses to American
genotype viruses, since the former have the potential to cause
DHF while the latter are associated only with DF (60, 70). All
amino acid residues with predicted biologic or enzymatic ac-
tivities in the encoded polypeptide were conserved among all
the viruses: cysteine residues in prM, E, and NS1; N-linked
glycosylation sites at prM-67, E-69, and NS1-207; the NS1/
NS2a cleavage motif in NS1 (14); the substrate binding pocket
of viral protease in NS3 (54); and an N-terminal sequence
motif in NS5, found in other S-adenosylmethionine-utilizing
methyltransferases (40). A total of 55 aa changes were consis-
tently detected between the two genotypes, while only 6 of
these resulted in a charge difference and 5 resulted in a side
chain difference (polar versus nonpolar). A summary of amino
acid substitutions that confer a change in charge or side chain
polarity is given in Table 4. Computer analysis of the amino
acid changes at prM-28 (Glu3Lys) and prM-31 (Val3Thr)
revealed a change of hydrophilicity and predicted antigenicity
for the samples belonging to the American genotype. The
amino acid charge difference at E-390 (Asn3Asp) did not
change the hydrophilicity or antigenicity profiles. Within the
nonstructural genes, the amino acid substitutions at positions
NS1-128 (Ser3Leu) and NS3-567 (Ile3Thr) did result in a
change of hydrophilicity and predicted antigenicity, while a
charge change at NS4b-17 from neutral to positive (Ser3His)
did not change the secondary structure. Five of the 8 aa
changes detected within the nonstructural genes were local-

(Asn3Asp), NS5-676 (Ser3Arg/Lys), and NS5-800 (Lys3Ser)
with a charge change did not change the structure, while the
changes at NS5-271 (Ile3Thr) and NS5-819 (Gln3Leu) re-
sulted in significant changes in the predicted hydrophilicity and
antigenicity profiles.
Phylogenetic analysis of full genome sequences. Maximum
parsimony analysis of the entire genomes resulted in an evo-
lutionary tree with branching patterns proportional to the ge-
netic relatedness among strains (Fig. 2). These results did not
differ substantially from previously published limited nucleo-
tide sequence comparisons (full genes, or parts of genes, e.g.,
240 nt at the E/NS1 gene junction). All DEN-2 viruses segre-
gated, as expected, into two different groups, each representing
a distinct genotype, as defined previously (58). The main dif-
ference seen in this analysis from previous phylogenetic studies
is that statistical measures of significance of monophyletic
groupings (bootstrap values) reached 100%, as would be ex-
pected from inclusion of the total available sequence data.
Within the Thai samples, there was neither an obvious segre-
gation according to geographic region (the two study locations
are located about 360 km apart) nor segregation according to
clinical outcome (DF versus DHF). However, all samples ob-
tained in the Americas that were associated with DF only
segregated to one phylogenetic group that was clearly distinct
from the Southeast Asian genotype.
Predicted RNA secondary structure of the 5* NTR. Within
the Thai samples, all nucleotide sequences were conserved in
this region and were identical to those of reference strain
16681, so the predicted RNA structures did not change. Within
the American genotype viruses, two consistent nucleotide
changes at positions 69 and 77 (A3T and A3G, respectively)
were observed compared to the Southeast Asian genotype vi-
ruses. The 97 nt of the 59 NTR were predicted to form a long
stem structure with a top loop (between nt 29 and 35), a short
loop (between nt 44 and 55), and a 39-terminal loop preceeding
the translation initiation codon (Fig. 3). Despite the fact that
sequences obtained from the first 68 nt were identical among
all viruses, those belonging to the American genotype had a
distinct sequence at nt 69 and 77 which changed the predicted

Predicted RNA secondary structure of the 3* NTR. Within

strain CO167 had one difference at nt 10554 (G3A). These
nucleotide differences did not segregate with disease associa-
tion nor did they alter the predicted secondary stem-loop struc-
ture. Within viruses of the American genotype, strain Ven2
had 5 nt differences compared to the rest of the group (nt

and strain 0147 had two differences (nt 10487 [C3T] and nt

that distinguished viruses across genotypes: all American sam-
ples have an 8-nt deletion at the beginning of the 39 NTR (nt
10276 to 10283) immediately downstream from the stop codon
along with two more interspersed deletions at positions 10299
and 10388, and they have consistent nucleotide differences at
positions 10297 (G3A), 10331 (A3G), 10388 (A3T), 10390
(A3G), and 10527 (A3G) compared to the Thai samples as
a group. Secondary structure predictions using all 443 to 455 nt
of the 39 NTR revealed characteristic conformations that seg-
regated the genotypes (Fig. 4); only the RNASTAR predic-
tions are shown here. The 100 nt at the 39 terminus were
conserved for all viruses studied, and their predicted folding
pattern formed a characteristic stem-loop structure described
previously (56). However, for the American genotype, a dras-
tically different structure was predicted for the area upstream

of nt 10498, with a very long stem and loop. The Southeast
Asian genotype virus RNA folded in a much more compact
pattern, with the possibility for more tertiary structure inter-
actions. To obtain a quantitative estimate of RNA structure
differences, an algorithm that compares stems and loops
(RNAdistance) was used to assign distance values and to gen-
erate a distance matrix of secondary structure relationships.
The distance matrix and its graphic representation, a phyloge-
netic tree (data not shown), displayed the same relationships
between viruses of the Southeast Asian and American geno-
type as when comparing full genome sequences (Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
Prior studies of wild and attenuated dengue viruses have
suggested that genetic differences among strains of the four
serotypes can be associated with attenuation, virulence, and/or
epidemic potential. Despite the fact that various numbers of
nucleotide and amino acid differences were found in coding or
noncoding regions of the genome, no specific site(s) could be
correlated with attenuation or severe disease in humans. In
vitro (e.g., plaque size) and in vivo (e.g., mouse neurovirulence
and monkey viremia) markers used to pinpoint probable viru-
lence determinants have been shown to be imperfect models of
human disease. This is the first report of genetic differences
between two DEN-2 genotypes that have been associated with
distinct clinical presentations in humans: the Southeast Asian
genotype with DF and DHF and the American genotype with
DF only. The new approach of full genome sequencing directly
from patient plasma avoids any selection of virus variants by
cultivation or cloning methods and is thus significantly differ-
ent from previous studies. Therefore, the resulting nucleotide
and/or amino acid differences we have reported here should
better reflect the virus population in the host and permit as-
sociation with pathogenesis.
It was not surprising that, within the Thai samples, no spe-
cific genome structures could be consistently correlated with
disease outcome (DF versus DHF); previous studies compar-
ing DEN-2 viruses from Thailand revealed similar results (3,
49). This observation supports the conclusion that all viruses
belonging to the Southeast Asian genotype have the potential
to cause severe disease; only epidemiologic associations pro-
vided the first indication that transmission of this genotype is
directly associated with the occurrence of severe dengue (60).
Ongoing studies in Peru reveal that no cases of DHF have
occurred in a population with high secondary infection rates,
and this is probably explained by the fact that only the Amer-
ican genotype of DEN-2 is being transmitted in this region
(70). We have shown that a comparison of viruses from genetic
groups with distinct clinical and epidemiologic associations can
better identify structural differences that correlate with patho-
genesis potential.
Significance of one E glycoprotein difference. The observed
amino acid difference between the Southeast Asian and Amer-
ican genotype viruses at position E-390 is of major importance.
The E glycoprotein, which is exposed on the surface of the
dengue virion, represents the dominant virus antigen, confer-
ring protective immune responses by eliciting neutralizing,
hemagglutination-inhibiting, antifusion, and virus-enhancing
antibodies and is responsible for virus attachment, virus-spe-
cific membrane fusion in acid pH endosomes, and virus assem-
bly (9, 61). An analogous situation has been described for
other flaviviruses: single-amino-acid substitutions in the enve-
lope protein at positions 52 (27), 138 (66), 271, and 336 in
Japanese encephalitis virus (7); at position 390 in Murray Val-
ley virus (44); at positions 104 and 107 in a tick-borne enceph-
alitis–DEN-4 chimera (53); and at positions 171 and 384 for
TBE virus (47) were shown to have a dramatic effect on viru-
lence in vitro or in vivo. Sanchez et al. reported that clones of
a DEN-2 virus (Mexican strain) with a single-amino-acid
change at position E-390 from Asp to His were virulent when
inoculated intracerebrally into suckling mice (63). Mutations
from Asp to Asn conferred attenuation; however, this corre-
lation is not seen in the Southeast Asian genotype viruses we
analyzed (Asn) compared to those belonging to the American
genotype (Asp). An attenuated DEN-2 vaccine candidate did
not differ from the parental virus strain in the E gene sequence
(38). These observations on attenuation differ from our results
in that the phenomenon we are attempting to measure deals
with the severity of disease (from DF to DHF) versus the
presence or absence of disease.
It is generally accepted that most antigenic determinants
reactive with antibodies are exposed on the surface of the
protein (2, 67) and hence are hydrophilic. Based on this notion,
algorithms which calculate hydrophilicity have been used to
predict antigenicity (30, 42). Most of the neutralization-resis-
tant variants of flaviviruses obtained so far have amino acid
substitutions which cause a change in charge (27, 34, 46), and
it is known that charged residues are important in the interac-
tion of antigenic sites with antibodies. An analysis of the en-
velope glycoprotein shows that residue E-390 is located in a
highly hydrophilic region; Asn and Asp have the same hydro-
philicity value, but the first is neutral in charge while the latter
is acidic.
In a manner analogous to the recently solved molecular
structure of the amino-terminal fragment of the TBE virus E
glycoprotein homodimer (57), the dengue E glycoprotein is
expected to fold into three distinct functional domains, named
I, II, and III, which correlate well with recently described
dengue virus E antigenic domains C, A, and B (61). The ob-
served difference in residue E-390 is localized in the C-termi-
nal domain III (aa 303 to 395) on the G-sheet (aa 388 to 394)
which forms, together with the C and the F sheet, the outer
lateral surface of the dimer. This is important because the
lateral surface of domain III is suggested to contain residues
implicated as determinants for host range, tropism, and viru-
lence in different flaviviruses (57). The observed amino acid
change at position E-390 is also localized within one of the
putative glycosaminoglycan binding motifs at aa 284 to 310 and
386 to 411 (9). These motifs have been shown to specifically
bind DEN-2 virus (Tonga, 1974) to the host cell surface, and
blockage of this receptor with an antagonist prevented infec-
tion. Since glycosaminoglycan binding motifs in proteins are
predicted by defining multiple regions enriched for basic
amino acids (17), it must be determined whether a change
from acidic Asp (American genotype) to neutral Asn (South-
east Asian genotype) enhances DEN-2 virus cell attachment.
Significance of prM differences. While monoclonal antibod-
ies specific for the prM protein of DEN-3 and DEN-4 viruses
have been shown to passively protect mice against challenge
with both homologous and heterologous dengue viruses (36),
prM monoclonal antibodies did not display neutralizing activ-
ity in vitro (4). The comparison of DEN-2 strain 16681 to its
vaccine derivative, strain PDK-53, revealed an amino acid
change from Asp to Val at position prM-29 (38). We identified
2 aa, at prM-28 and prM-31, that distinguished the Southeast
Asian from the American genotype; however, since the anti-
genic structure of prM is not known and the locations of
protective epitopes have not been identified, the role of these
amino acid changes is difficult to assess.
Significance of NS4b and NS5 differences. Although some
structural properties of dengue virus NS4b and NS5 have been

elucidated, little is known about their antigenic structure. For
NS4a and NS4b proteins it was shown that, despite marked
amino acid sequence heterogeneity, their hydrophilicity pro-
files are remarkably conserved among the dengue viruses and
flaviviruses in general. In terms of function, both NS4 proteins
may be involved in membrane localization of NS3 and NS5
replication complexes via protein-protein interaction (8). The
observed residue change at NS4b-17 did not affect the hydro-
phobicity profiles, and its importance in protein function is
unknown. Because the NS5 gene presumably encodes a protein
with important enzymatic functions, the RNA polymerase (40),
there was conservation of its structure, especially in the pre-
sumed active sites. Of 5 aa substitutions observed here, 3, at
NS5-645 (Asn3Asp), NS5-676 (Ser3Arg/Lys), and NS5-800
(Lys3Ser), conferred a charge change, but were not predicted
to change the structure, while the side chain changes at NS5-
271 (Ile3Thr) and NS5-819 (Gln3Leu) resulted in significant
differences in hydrophilicity and antigenicity. However, since
the three-dimensional structure or antigenic function of the
NS5 protein has not been determined, the relative contribution
of these changes to infectivity and immunogenicity is unknown.
Significance of NTR differences. The NTRs of several pos-
itive-strand RNA viruses are predicted to fold into stem-loop
structures that interact with viral or cellular proteins (1, 5, 12,
23, 51). At the 59 NTR, ribosomes bind to the 59 terminus of
the positive strand to initiate translation, and replicase binds to
the 39 terminus of the minus strand to initiate transcription of
positive strands, thus regulating replication. Mutations that
modify these structures, and thereby alter the RNA-protein
interactions, have been shown to affect virulence or cause at-
tenuation (31, 37). A single-nucleotide mutation in the 59 NTR
of poliovirus is associated with neurovirulence (13), and atten-
uation was correlated with disruption of its secondary structure
(45). Engineered mutations and deletions in the 59 NTR of a
full-length DEN-4 cDNA clone were shown to restrict DEN-4
virus growth in cell culture and in inoculated mosquitoes (6);
most mutations within the long stem structure were lethal, but
RNA transcripts containing deletions in the loop or short stem
regions were usually infectious. However, a mutant bearing
deletions in the 39-terminal loop was least efficient in transla-
tion. Our results show that an A-to-U mutation that distin-
guishes Southeast Asian from American genotype viruses at
position 69 was predicted to change the secondary structure of
the viral RNA: a 4-nt-long bulge was formed at the 59 terminus
of the American genotype, which reduced the length of the
stem, but increased the length of the 39-terminal loop.
Whether the presence of this small bulge could reduce trans-
lation efficiency remains unclear; bulges as small as 1 nt have
been shown to reduce RNA-protein interactions in other viral
systems (71, 73).
The 39 NTR contains sequences essential for virus replica-
tion and growth, serving as signals for the initiation of minus-
strand synthesis, and possibly packaging in yellow fever and
DEN-4 (23, 50). A stable secondary structure motif, formed by
the 39-terminal 100 nt, was described for all mosquito-borne
flaviviruses studied to date (21, 23, 56, 65, 72). Within this
region and farther upstream, three highly conserved se-
quences, termed CS1, CS2, and RCS2, are thought to be func-
tionally important elements of the 39 NTR (23). While conser-
vation of the 39-terminal region is assumed to be essential for
flaviviruses, there is evidence that regions farther upstream
determine virus replication efficiency. Deletions introduced
into full-length DEN-4 cDNA clones that did not extend be-
yond the 39-terminal 113 nt were viable when transfected into
cells in culture, but they exhibited a range of growth restric-
tions (50). In the 19 viruses we compared, a conserved region
of 110 nt was found at the 39 terminus, which folded in a form
seen in other flaviviruses (56). However, a striking size and
sequence heterogeneity was observed in the 300-nt upstream
region that allowed us to distinguish the genotypes, based on
nucleotide alignments. All American genotype samples re-
vealed deletions in the region immediately downstream of the
stop codon as well as 5 interspersed nt differences when com-
pared to the Southeast Asian genotype; secondary structure
predictions yielded drastically different conformations that
were characteristic for each genotype. The importance of these
structures in defining dengue virus pathogenicity is unknown,
but 39 NTR structure has also been shown to correlate with
virulence in yellow fever (55) and TBE (56) viruses.
With the approach used here, focusing on consistent differ-
ences between two genotypes, we have reduced the back-
ground “noise” (e.g., single nucleotides) that may not be di-
rectly involved in determining pathogenicity. Virus virulence
characteristics have been shown to be due to the synergistic
effect of various genomic loci; it is possible that dengue patho-
genesis is the result of cohesive activity of the sites we have
pinpointed here, in addition to host immunologic factors. The
amino acid substitutions within the coding region, which may
affect antigenicity or cell attachment, and nucleotide changes
within the NTRs, affecting secondary structure and thereby
replication, may be the viral determinants of severe dengue in
humans. Genome differences in nonstructural genes or in the
NTRs potentially altering replication efficiency could possibly
be measured most effectively in terms of human viremias. In
addition, we are currently deriving modified infectious clones
to test these hypotheses, by using reverse genetics, although we
are limited to imperfect models of human disease for testing
phenotype. Further sequence analyses may also confirm
whether the structures we have found are maintained consis-
tently in other dengue transmission cycles. From our data it
could be concluded that, for vaccine design, it would be ad-
vantageous to manipulate the NTRs of the genome to reduce
viral replication, whereas high immunogenicity would be en-
sured by maintaining the native structure of the viral proteins.
