ABSTRACT
Tertiary interactions are crucial in maintaining the
tRNA structure and functionality. We used a com-
bined sequence analysis and quantum mechanics
approach to calculate accurate energies of the most
frequent tRNA tertiary base pairing interactions. Our
analysis indicates that six out of the nine classical
tertiary interactions are held in place mainly by
H-bonds between the bases. In the remaining three
cases other effects have to be considered. Tertiary
base pairing interaction energies range from 8 to
38 kcal/mol in yeast tRNAPhe and are estimated to
contribute roughly 25% of the overall tRNA base
pairing interaction energy. Six analyzed posttransla-
tional chemical modifications were shown to have
minor effect on the geometry of the tertiary interac-
tions. Modifications that introduce a positive charge
strongly stabilize the corresponding tertiary interac-
tions. Non-additive effects contribute to the stability
of base triplets.
INTRODUCTION
The canonical tRNA conformation, characterized by two
helical domains perpendicularly oriented, has already been
known for 30 years (1–5). Besides the regular Watson–
Crick pairs enclosed in the tRNA stems, specific base pairing
interactions have been observed in crystal and NMR struc-
tures of tRNA molecules, which are known as tRNA tertiary
interactions (Figure 1).
The major interactions maintaining the well-known
tRNA L-shape are generally assumed to occur at the corner
of the molecule. This region, where the D and T-loops meet,
contains several unique elements, including the T54–A58
reverse-Hoogsteen (RH) base pair, the G18–Y55 and G19–
C56 inter-loop base pairs and stack of the four mutually
intercalated A58–G18–A/G57–G19 purine bases. All these
interactions are highly conserved in cytosolic tRNAs, indic-
ating their importance for the tRNA function. Available
experimental data also support the functional importance of
such a region. Mutants of the Escherichia coli tRNAAla(CUA)
obtained by random mutagenesis and having at least one of
the above-mentioned interactions disrupted were shown to be
non-functional (6), and insertion of additional nucleotides into
the T-loop or deletion of G19 from the D-loop affected the
accuracy of the codon–anticodon recognition, resulting in a
frameshift (7,8). It is also known that modification of the
D- and T-loops region can influence the processing of the
30 and 50 termini, as well as the CCA-addition. For instance,
disruption of the base pairs between the D and T-loop had
a negative effect on the 30 and 50 processing of tRNAHis
from Drosophila (9), while positions 57 and 58 of the T-
loop were involved in the recognition by the CCA-adding
enzyme (10).
Other interactions at the elbow of the structure given by
conserved and semiconserved nucleotides of the D and V arms
define the core of tRNA molecules. These are the G15–C48
reverse Watson–Crick (RWC) base pair; and the 10–25–45, 9–
12–23 and 13–22–46 base triplets, where a canonical WC base
pair of the D-stem interacts in the wide groove with a third
base from the D or V arm. In the D arm, nucleotide U8 also
gives a RH base pair with A14, which in turn, in several
canonical tRNAs as yeast tRNAAsp, H-bonds to A21. A
purine–purine 26–44 bp, causing a kink between the anticodon
and D stems, completes the picture of the tertiary interactions
in canonical tRNA. Experimental studies support the import-
ance of the core structure in aminoacylation of several
tRNAs, such as E.coli tRNACys (11–13), yeast tRNAAsp (14)
and E.coli tRNAGln (15). To quote some examples, the sub-
stitution of the 15–48 bp in E.coli tRNACys has been shown to
decrease the catalytic efficiency of aminoacylation by two
orders of magnitude (13), whereas mutations designed to
disrupt the tertiary structure of yeast tRNAAsp, involving
the D-stem or D-loop, have been shown to decrease the spe-
cificity constant for aspartylation up to three–four orders of

magnitude (14). Moreover, recent studies on mitochondrial
tRNAs exhibiting a canonical cytosolic-like structure
have shown that the identity of nt 48 governs the human
tRNALeu(CUN) accepting activity (16) and mutation of
G10 in yeast tRNAGln and deletion of position 45 in yeast
tRNAArg2 determine defective acylation (17). The 10–25 bp
has been also shown to be one of the major binding sites
of E.coli tRNAGln to the parent synthetase (15).
Many of the above-mentioned studies showed that the
functional importance of non-standard interactions could
be ascribed to their role in maintaining the tRNA tertiary
structure (14,16–21).
Recently, structural elements resembling the D and/or
T-loop region of tRNAs have been identified in RNase P
and in the ribosome (22,23), as well as in RNA viruses
genome (24,25). This finding suggests that larger RNAs
may use conformation-stabilizing strategies analogous to
those found in the small tRNA molecule.
Altogether such data call for a thorough analysis of the
particular role played by each tRNA element in its structure
and function. The systematic elucidation of strategies specific
to different RNAs may indeed constitute a very important
step toward the understanding of how RNA tertiary structure
forms and how it defines the function of the molecule. In order
to contribute to the on-going systematic investigation of the
different forces that determine RNAs structure, here we focus
on the interaction energy of H-bonded nucleic acid base pairs
and triplets in tRNA tertiary interactions.
It is important to note that the structure of RNAs is determ-
ined by the interplay of several forces with H-bonds interac-
tion between bases being one of the most relevant. Other
important forces are due to base–base stacking interactions,
base–backbone and backbone–backbone interactions as well
as effects due to the ‘environment’ such as RNA interaction
with solvent, metal ions, small-molecules and proteins. Sev-
eral studies were performed to shed light on the different
forces that determine nucleic acids structure. In particular
advanced quantum mechanics methods are especially suitable
for the evaluation of the strength of H-bonded bases
interaction (26–41).
In this context, Sˇponer et al. (33) demonstrated recently
that computationally expensive second order Møller–Plesset
(MP2) technique (42), in conjugation with rather extended
basis sets, is probably the method of choice for the evaluation
of base pairing interactions. Unfortunately, routine calcula-
tions at this level are unfeasible even for nucleic acid pairs.
The situation has improved with the implementation of the
resolution of identity MP2 (RIMP2) procedure which provides
essentially identical results as the MP2 method with a fraction
of computational resources (43–45). This opened the route to
large-scale MP2-level calculations of base pairing. Neverthe-
less, when the complexity (and the size) of the problem raises

from base pairs to base triplets computer power remains a
limitation. Density functional theory (DFT) based methods
are the most reasonable alternative approaches for the calcu-
lation of geometry and energy of H-bonded base clusters.
Comparison of the hybrid B3LYP (46–49) and of the pure
PW91 (50,51) functionals with RIMP2 results on an extended
set of base pairs showed that geometries are much less sens-
itive to the level of calculations than base pairing energies
(33). In fact, B3LYP optimizations were shown to provide
extremely similar donor–acceptor distances as the RIMP2/
cc-pVTZ method, with a typical elongation around 0.03 s.
As far as energies are concerned, the B3LYP method system-
atically underestimates the reference RIMP2 data by 1.4–
3.6 kcal/mol. The largest discrepancy in the relative order
of stability between two bp is 2.2 kcal/mol. The PW91 func-
tional, suggested by Mu¨ller et al. (52) and Tsuzuki and
Lu¨thi (53) to perform better than the B3LYP functional,
improves the agreement with the reference RIMP2 values
to 0.8/+1.8 kcal/mol (33). However, the relative stability
of two bp is not improved compared with the B3LYP method
(largest error is 2.6 kcal/mol). Moreover, the PW91 functional
slightly exaggerates monomer deformation energies. Incident-
ally, DFT methods completely fail to describe base stacking
(29,32).
Since we are interested here in base pairs and triplets
RIMP2 cannot be the workhorse. We thus decided to evaluate
geometries using the B3LYP approach and then calculate
interaction energies at the RIMP2 level of theory. Considering
that our recipe is extremely close to the approach used by
Sˇponer et al. to obtain highly accurate interaction energies
(33), it is not surprising that our computed interaction energies
almost match the values they reported. In the few cases where
comparison is possible, the stability of the base pairs we
calculated is on the average 0.3 kcal/mol from the stability
they obtained using the full RIMP2/aug-cc-pVTZ method.
This validates the approach we used and, consequently,
makes the comparison with their results straightforward.
Finally, since accurate evaluation of H-bonded bases
energy is a rather demanding task, other forces will be not
discussed here.
Optimal geometries and accurate interaction energies
have been evaluated for all the H-bonded bases, including
ribose C10 atoms, in the nine classical tertiary interactions
(schematic diagram in Figure 1), as extracted from the
best-resolution tRNA structure now available. This is the
yeast tRNAPhe X-ray structure solved at 1.93 s (PDB code:
1ehz) (54).
Yeast tRNAPhe was the first tRNA molecule to have its
structure solved and its tertiary H-bonding interactions
described and characterized (55–57). A statistical analysis
on the available tRNA sequences, here performed to identify
the most frequently occurring nucleic acid base combina-
tions for each classical tertiary interaction, showed that
yeast tRNAPhe is also a very good representative for class I
cytolosic tRNAs. However, when the most frequent combina-
tions did not correspond to those present in yeast tRNAPhe
(2 out of the 9 analyzed cases), their geometry and interaction
energy were also computed. In all cases, when the tertiary
interaction included chemically modified bases, we also con-
sidered the corresponding interaction with the unmodified
bases, in order to allow a comparison.
This study thus provides the first accurate estimate of
the interaction energy of H-bonded bases in tRNA tertiary
interactions. It also gives insight into the effect of chemical
modifications of the bases on the structure and stability of the
interaction. Comparison of the energy of the different inter-
actions outlines which of them contribute most to the tRNA
structure stability, and possibly constitutes a valuable basis
for the rational design of combinatorial tRNA gene libraries
and tRNA site-directed mutants. The latter aspect is especially
interesting as it has been shown that affinity of mutant tRNA
for protein targets can arise from stabilization of RNA tertiary
interactions rather than optimization of RNA–protein contacts
(58). The calculated energies may also be useful for imple-
menting algorithms for RNA structure prediction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
tRNA sequence and structure analysis
We analyzed all the 466 tRNA cytoplasmic sequences, 369 of
class I and 97 of class II, including posttranslational modified
bases downloaded from the ‘Compilation of tRNA sequences
(September 2004 edition)’ (59,60). For each sequence we
recorded the occurring nucleic acid base combination in the
positions relative to each classical tertiary interaction. Twenty-
one non-redundant structures of free tRNAs (PDB codes: 1ehz,
2tra, 1fir), tRNA-synthetase complexes (PDB codes: 1f7u,
1asz, 1il2, 1c0a, 1o0c, 1n78, 1ffy, 1eiy, 1h4s, 1qf6, 1h3e,
1ser, 1j1u, 1ivs, 1u0b, 1wz2) and tRNA-elongation factor
Tu complexes (PDB codes: 1ttt, 1b23) determined by X-ray
crystallography at a resolution of 3.3 s or better were collected
from the PDB data archive (61). Structure analysis was per-
formed using the InsightII software (62). Using the set of
tools available in the package, we analyzed H-bond patterns
of observed tertiary interactions and, when of interest, per-
formed structural superimpositions.
Computational details
The TURBOMOLE package was used for all the calculations
discussed in the present paper (63). The hybrid B3LYP
functional was used for all geometry optimizations unless
otherwise specified. The cc-pVTZ basis set (64) was used
for geometry optimizations. Interaction energies were calcu-
lated on the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ geometries at the RIMP2 level
of theory using the cc-pVTZ basis set on C atoms and on H
atoms bonded to C atoms, while the more extended aug-cc-
pVTZ basis sets (64) was used for N, O and polar H atoms. The
extended aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets could not be used for all
the atoms due to severe linear dependency of the resulting
molecular orbitals in the triplets. All interaction energies
were corrected for basis set superimposition error (BSSE)
using the counterpoise procedure of Boys and Bernardi (65).
Two different sets of total interaction energies were evalu-
ated. In the first approach we optimized the position of all the
atoms in the base pair/triplet, and the total interaction energy
was calculated relative to the fully optimized and isolated
bases. This is the standard approach used in the literature,
and a detailed discussion on this approach can be found in
previous papers (33,66). We refer to these total interaction
energies as DEOpt. In the case of a base pair DEOpt is calculated

as shown in the following equation.
DEOpt ¼ EOptXY  ðE0XE0YÞ  BSSE‚ 1
where EOptXY is the energy of the optimized X–Y base pair,
and E0Xand E

Y are the energies of the isolated and optimized
X and Y bases. Within this approach the deformation energy
EDef, which is the energy required to deform the isolated and
relaxed bases to the geometry they assume in the base pair/
triplet, can be also obtained. In the case of a base pair EDef is
calculated as shown in the following equation.
EDef ¼ ðEXYX  EXYY Þ  ðE0X  E0YÞ‚ 2
where EXYX and E
XY
Y are the energies of the isolated X and Y
bases with the geometry frozen to that in the fully optimized
X–Y pair. By definition EDef always destabilizes the bases
interaction. Finally, the interaction energy EInter, which is
the interaction energy between the bases in the geometry
they assume in the base pair/triplet, can also be obtained.
In the case of a base pair EInter is calculated as shown in
the following equation.
EInter ¼ EOptXY  ðEXYX  EXYY Þ  BSSE: 3
Equations 1–3 can be combined as DEOpt ¼ EInter + EDef.
In the second approach we optimized the position of the H
atoms only, while all the heavy atoms in the base pair/triplet
were frozen as in the X-ray structure. The interaction energy
was calculated relative to the unrelaxed isolated bases using
a rigid body approximation, i.e. the base pair/triplet was
rigidly fragmented into the bases, which implies that in the
rigid body approximation EDef is not defined. We refer to
these rigid body interaction energies as DERBI. In the case
of a base pair the DERBI is calculated as shown in the following
equation.
DERBI ¼ ERBIXY  ðERBIX  ERBIY Þ  BSSE‚ 4
where ERBIXY is the energy of the X–Y base pair with the heavy
atoms frozen to the X-ray geometry, ERBIX and E
RBI
Y are the
energies of the isolated X and Y bases with the geometry
frozen to that in the X–Y pair.
Extension of DEOpt, EDef and DERBI to a base triplet or to
the decomposition of a X–Y–Z triplet into the X–Y and Z
fragments is straightforward. Furthermore, as indicated by
Burda et al. (66) the interaction energy of base triplets can
be decomposed into 3 bp pairwise interactions and a three-
body contribution E3 as shown in the following equation.
DEOptXYZ ¼ DEOptXY þ DEOptXZ þ DEOptYZ þ E3; 5
where DEOptXY, DE
Opt
XZ and DE
Opt
YZ are the X–Y, X–Z and Y–Z
pairs interaction energy with the bases fixed to the geometry
they have in the optimized triplet. The three-body contribution
E3 is a measure of the non-additivity of the base pair
interactions (66).
RESULTS
tRNA sequence and structure analysis
Some tRNA tertiary interactions, such as 8–14–21, 18–55, 19–
56 and 54–58, involve the highly conserved nucleotides U8,
A14, G18, G19, A21, T54, Y55, C56 and A58, whereas others
allow a certain nucleotide variability. For each classical ter-
tiary interaction, we recorded all the possible nucleic acid base
combinations occurring in the available cytoplasmic tRNA
sequences (59,60). Interactions corresponding to the most
frequent base combinations in class I cytosolic tRNAs have
been considered here and are reported in Table 1 along with
relative occurrences. They have been visually verified in
available tRNA structures. PDB codes of the best resolution
structures exhibiting each specific interaction are also reported
in Table 1.
The most represented combination corresponds to that
present in the yeast tRNAPhe, which has also the best
resolution structure solved to date (Pdb code: 1ehz, resolution
1.93 s), for seven of the nine interactions. The only exceptions
are represented by the interactions at positions 10–25–45
and 54–58, where yeast tRNAPhe nucleotide combinations
are N2-methylguanine-cytosine-guanine (m2G-C-G) and
thymine-1-methyladenine (T-m1A). m2G10-C25-G45 and
T54-m1A58 are the second most populated combinations
with an occurrence of 25 and 23%, respectively, after the
corresponding interactions (G10–C25–G45, T54–A58) lack-
ing a posttranslational chemical modification.
On these grounds, we chose the structure of tRNAPhe
(Pdb code: 1ehz) as the reference system for our calculation
of interaction energy of tRNA tertiary base pairing
interactions.
Molecular structures and interaction energies
Optimized geometries and relative interaction energies
(DEOpt) were computed for the base pairs and triplets reported
in Table 1. These are the ideal geometries and inter-
action energies that would be obtained in the gas phase in
the absence of any other effect. The relative H-bond distances
are reported in Table 2. Additionally, interaction energies
were also computed for the tertiary base pairs and triplets
with the geometry fixed to the yeast tRNAPhe 1ehz X-ray
structure (DERBI). The interaction energy DERBI is an estimate
of the contribution of each base pairing interaction to the
overall stability of the tRNA. The base pairs interaction energy
is calculated relative to the two separated bases, while in the
case of base triplets two different interaction energies are
reported. In fact, besides the interaction energy relative to
the three separated bases, we also calculated the interaction
energy between the main base pair and the third interacting
base. This provides an estimate of the tertiary interaction
energy for triplets where a WC pair enclosed into the D
stem interacts with a third base. All the calculated DEOpt
and DERBI are reported in Table 3.
Furthermore, in the case of base triplets we also calculated
the interaction energy for the three possible base pairs that
can be obtained from fragmentation of the triplet. In these
calculations we fixed the base pairs at the geometry they
have in the optimized or X-ray triplets. For base pairs giving
at least two H-bonds, ideal geometry and energy were also
computed in the absence of the third interacting base, to invest-
igate the effect of the tertiary interaction on the base pair
geometry and stability. All the pairwise interaction energies
are reported in Table 4. The difference between the triplet
DEOpt and the sum of the three pairwise interaction energies

is a measure of non-additive effects (E3). These non-additive
effects cannot be recovered by empirical force fields, which
are based on two-body interaction terms, and their magnitude
underlines the necessity of using a quantum mechanics
approach in the calculation of base triplets and beyond.
The superimposition of the optimized and X-ray base tri-
plets and pairs are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively; root
mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values are reported in
Table 2.
The U8–A14–A21 triplet. The geometry of the U8–A14
RH base pair in the optimized triplet is quite similar to the
U8-A14 pair in 1ehz (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.21 s, H-bonds within
0.12 s) (Figure 2 and Table 2) as well as to an isolated U–
A RH base pair (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.03 s, H-bonds within 0.01 s).
This implies that the presence of the A21 base does not
influence the geometry of the slightly non-planar U8–A14
pair. As regards the A14–A21 interaction, in the optimized
triplet the N6(A14):N3(A21) H-bond is formed. In 1ehz this
H-bond is missing, while a H-bond instead occurs between
N1(A21) and ribose O20(U8). Nevertheless, the N6(A14):
N3(A21) H-bond is present in other tRNA structures such
as Methanococcus jannaschii tRNALys (PDB code: 1j1u)
(67), which also presents the N1(A21):O20(U8) H-bond as
1ehz, and yeast tRNAAsp (PDB code: 2tra) (68), which
instead presents a N1(A14):O20(A21) H-bond. The skeleton
of 1j1u is reported in black in Figure 2. Visual inspection
clearly indicates that the same A14–A21 H-bond is present
in the optimized and in the 1j1u triplets. However, in the
optimized triplet A21 rotates remarkably as compared with
A21 in 2tra.
The U8–A14 interaction DEOpt in the optimized triplet is
only 0.4 kcal/mol weaker than the interaction energy in the
isolated optimized U–A RH pair (Table 4), which further
supports that the U8–A14 pair is very little perturbed in the
triplet. Overall, the stability of the optimized base triplet start-
ing from the three isolated bases (Table 3) is very close to the
sum of the three possible base pairs (U8–A14, U8–A21 and
A14–A21) pairwise interaction energies,22.5 kcal/mol. This
implies that non-additive effects, E3 ¼ 1.5 kcal/mol only
slightly stabilize the triplet.

DEOpt is the stabilization energy of the base pair/triplet starting from the optimized and isolated bases. DEOpt can be decomposed as DEOpt ¼ EDef + EInter, where
EDef is the energy required to deform the isolated bases to the geometry they assume in the base pair/triplet and EInter is the interaction energy between the bases in
the geometry they assume in the base pair/triplet. DERBI is the interaction energy of the base pair/triplet with the geometry fixed to the yeast tRNAPhe 1ehz X-ray
structure. For triplets two energy values are reported. In the first approach the X–Y–Z triplet is fragmented into the three bases, X, Y and Z, and the interaction
energy reported reflects the X. . .Y. . .Z interaction. In the second approach the X–Y–Z triplet is fragmented into the base pair (X–Y) and the base Z, and the interaction
energy reported reflects the (X–Y). . .Z interaction. E3 is the three-body contribution to the total interaction energy of triplets; it is a measure of the non-additivity of
the pairwise base interactions. Further details can be found in Computational details section.

The U8–A14 and U8–A21 rigid body interaction energies
DERBI in the 1ehz structure are rather similar to those obtained
for the optimized base triplet, although heavy atoms were not
relaxed (Table 4). Instead, the A14–A21 interaction is quite
weaker in the 1ehz triplet relative to the optimized structure,
consequence of the missing A41–A21 H-bond in the X-ray
structure. The overall stability of the 1ehz base triplet is thus
consistently reduced as compared with the optimized triplet.
As final control, we calculated the rigid body A14–A21
interaction in 1j1u and 2tra, which both present the
N6(A14):N3(A21) H-bond. In 1j1u the A14–A21 interaction
amounts to DERBI ¼ 6.2 kcal/mol, while in 2tra it amounts

to DERBI ¼ 5.9 kcal/mol. These values are much more
similar to the A14–A21 interaction in the optimized triplet,
and consistent with the presence of a H-bond between the
bases.

U12–A23 WC base pair in the optimized triplet is very similar

U–A WC base pair (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.02 s, H-bonds within
0.01 s). In all the three cases the U–A WC pair is planar.
These results imply that the presence of the third A9 base has
minor influence on the geometry adopted by the U12–A23
pair. On the contrary, the A9–A23 N7-amino symmetric
(N7as) pair in the optimized triplet as well as the isolated
N7as A–A pair is planar, whereas this pair is slightly buckled
in 1ehz. Despite of the planarity in the optimized triplet a
rather good superimposition between the optimized and the
X-ray triplets is obtained (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.27 s, H-bonds within
0.16 s).
The U12–A23 as well as the A9–A23 interaction energies in
the optimized triplet are very close to interaction energies in
the isolated U–A WC and A–A N7as pairs, respectively. This
further supports that the two pairs are very little perturbed in
the optimized triplet. Overall, the stability of the optimized
base triplet starting from the three isolated bases is very
close to the sum of the three pairwise interaction energies,
24.8 kcal/mol. This again indicates that non-additive effects,
E3 ¼ 1.3 kcal/mol, slightly stabilize the triplet.
The rigid body interaction energies of the three possible
base pairs in the 1ehz structure are rather similar (within
1.9 kcal/mol) to the interaction energies obtained from the
optimized base triplet (Table 4). The overall stability of the
1ehz base triplet is only 2.1 kcal/mol lower than the optimized
value. Considering the rigid body approximation used the
rather good agreement between DERBI and DEOpt is quite
remarkable.
The m2G10–C25–G45 triplet. The m2G10–C25 WC base
pair in the optimized triplet is very similar to that in 1ehz
(r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.38 s, H-bonds within 0.04 s). Conversely,
the m2G10–C25 WC pair in the optimized triplet is some-
what different from the isolated m2G–C WC base pair
(r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.17 s), although H-bonds are within 0.03 s.
The main difference lies in the planarity of the isolated
m2G–C WC pair, whereas in both the optimized and X-ray
triplets the m2G10–C25 pair is not planar.
Moreover, visual inspection of Figure 2 clearly shows that
G45 assumes a different orientation after geometry optimiza-
tion. Specifically, the G45 base rotates by roughly 180 around
the O6(m2G10):N2(G45) H-bond, and in the optimized geo-
metry the G45(C10) atom is near to the C25 base. This remark-
able geometrical rearrangement of G45 allows the formation
of a weak H-bond like interaction between N4(C25) and
N3(G45). To test whether this rearrangement of G45 is
dependent on the theoretical approach used we performed a
further optimization of the triplet at the more accurate (but
much more computationally expensive) RIMP2/cc-pVTZ
level. Also at this level of theory G45 rearranges as shown
in Figure 2.
The main difference between the rigid body and optimized
interaction energies is the higher stability of the interaction
between the m2G10–C25 pair and the G45 base in the
optimized structure. The overall stability of the X-ray triplet
is only 0.2 kcal/mol higher than the sum of the 3 bp pairwise
interaction energies, which indicates that non-additive effects
are substantially negligible in the X-ray geometry.
The C13–G22–m7G46 triplet. The geometry of the C13–G22
WC base pair in the optimized triplet is very similar to the
geometry in 1ehz (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.12 s, H-bonds within 0.10 s),
but it is somewhat different from the geometry of an isolated
C–G WC base pair. In fact, in the optimized triplet the H-
bonds are even 0.15 s different from the isolated pair. A
possible explanation is that the positively charged m7G
base electrostatically repels the positively charged N4
amino group of C13.
As regards the G22–m7G46 N7-imino (N7i) pair, the geo-
metry in the optimized triplet is planar, whereas it is slightly
non-planar in 1ehz. The G22–m7G46 H-bonds in the optim-
ized triplet are roughly 0.10–0.15 s shorter than in the X-ray
structure while they are rather close to the H-bonds in the
isolated G–m7G N7i pair. This suggests that in the optimized
triplet the interaction between the charged m7G46 base and
G22 is overestimated. It is likely that in the complete tRNAPhe
structure the m7G46 and G22 interaction is damped by
surrounding phosphate groups.
The C13–G22 and G22–m7G interactions in the fully
optimized triplet are 1.2 and 1.7 kcal/mol weaker than
in the isolated C–G WC and G–m7G N7i pairs, respectively,
which further supports that the triplet is somewhat perturbed
by the repulsive C13 and m7G46 interaction. Remarkably,
in this triplet the non-canonical G22–m7G46 interaction is
roughly 7 kcal/mol stronger than the canonical WC C13–
G22 interaction. Overall, the stability of the fully optimized
base triplet starting from the three isolated bases is remarkably
higher than the sum of the three pairwise interaction energies,
54.1 kcal/mol. This indicates that non-additive effects,
E3 ¼ 7.0 kcal/mol, are particularly strong.
In the rigid body approximation, the stability of the
three possible base pairs is 3–5 kcal/mol higher than those
obtained for the optimized base triplet. This is due to the
quite high deformation energy we calculated for this triplet,
EDef ¼ 5.8 kcal/mol, that reduces the DEOpt value and is not
considered in the rigid body approximation (see Computa-
tional details). The overall stability of the base triplet is
roughly 5 kcal/mol higher than that calculated for the optim-
ized triplet. Considering the rigid body approximation used,
and the remarkably high stability of this triplet, we believe
there is a reasonable agreement between the DEOpt and DERBI
values also in this case.
The G15–C48 pair. This pair presents an RWC geometry in
the 1ehz structure. However, previous quantum mechanics
studies evidenced that the isolated G–C RWC pair is not a
stable geometry due to repulsive amino–amino and carbonyl–
carbonyl contacts (35). Consistently, in our geometry optim-
ization of the G15–C48 1ehz pair the RWC geometry is
not retained and the optimized G15–C48 pair presents the
bifurcated H-bond pattern shown in Figure 3. The severe
geometrical rearrangement indeed alleviates the amino–
amino repulsion. However, it also breaks the
N2(G15):N3(C48) H-bond of the X-ray structure. The
O2(C48):N1(G15) H-bond is retained after optimization,
but C48 shifts in such a way that the O2(C48):N2(G15) H-
bond is formed.
The interaction between G15 and C48 in the optimized
pair is quite strong. Interestingly, the rigid body interaction
clearly indicates that the G15–C48 RWC pair contributes
noticeably to the 1ehz stability, although the isolated GC
RWC pair is not a stable structure.

The G18–Y55 pair. The optimized base pair is quite similar
to the geometry in 1ehz (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.30 s, H-bonds within
0.19 s). Both the X-ray and optimized pairs are substantially
twisted. The main difference is in the stretch of the H-bonds.
The optimized H-bonds are 0.17/0.19 s longer than in the X-
ray structure. The G18–Y55 interaction in the optimized pair
is rather close to the rigid body interaction energy, which
again indicates an overall similarity between the optimized
and the X-ray pairs.
The G19–C56 pair. The optimized base pair is relatively
similar to the geometry in 1ehz (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.45 s). However,
the X-ray pair is substantially non-planar whereas the optim-
ized pair is only slightly twisted. Consistently the optimized
H-bonds are somewhat different from the X-ray values.
In particular the optimized O6(G19):N4(G56) H-bond
is 0.23 s shorter, and the optimized N2(G19):O2(C56)
H-bond is 0.12 s longer than in the X-ray structure.
The G19–C56 interaction in the optimized pair is 2.7 kcal/
mol weaker than in 1ehz. While the difference between the
DEOpt and DERBI could be somewhat surprising, the DERBI is
only 0.7 kcal/mol away from the Einter calculated for the
optimized pair. In short, the G–C WC pair is destabilized
by a sizeable deformation energy, EDef ¼ 3.4 kcal/mol.
The m22G26–A44 pair. The optimized base pair is very
similar to the geometry in 1ehz (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.25 s, H-
bonds within 0.16 s). Both the optimized and the X-ray
pairs are substantially non-planar.
The m22G22–A44 interaction in the optimized structure is
2.3 kcal/mol stronger than that in 1ehz. The poor stability of
the X-ray pair is probably due to the substantial planarity
around the N2(m22G26) atom, which results in a rather
short distance, 3.26 s, and consequently repulsive interaction
between the CM1(m22G26) and C2(A44) atoms (Figure 3).
In the optimized pair the N2(m22G26) atom is substantially
pyramidal, and this pyramidalization results in a much
longer distance, 3.63 s, between the CM1(m22G26) and
C2(A44) atoms.
The T54–m1A58 pair. The geometry of the optimized base
pair is quite similar to the geometry in 1ehz (r.m.s.d. ¼
0.21 s). However, the optimized structure presents the
O2(T54):N6(m1A58) H-bond, whereas the distance between
these two atoms is 0.53 s longer in the X-ray structure. Both
the optimized and the X-ray pairs are substantially planar. The
T54–m1A58 interaction in the optimized pair is 1.8 kcal/mol
stronger than in 1ehz. The higher stability of the optimized
pair is a consequence of the additional O2(T54):N6(m1A58)
H-bond.
Comparison with corresponding interactions lacking
posttranslational chemical modifications
To get insight on the role of the chemical modification on the
geometry and stability of the tertiary interactions, we also
examined the G10–C25–G45 and C13–G22–G46 base trip-
lets, as well as the G18–U55, G26–A44 and T54–A58/
U54–m1A58/U54–A58 base pairs. They are all represented
in available tRNA sequences and, but for the U54–m1A58
pair, observed in solved tRNA structures (Table 1). With
the exception of U54–m1A58/U54–A58, they all correspond
to the first or second most populated nucleic acid bases
combination for each specific interaction. Superimposition
between the modified and unmodified base pairs and
triplets is reported in Figure 4.
The optimized G10–C25–G45 triplet is extremely similar
to the m2G10–C25–G45 triplet (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.04 s). Consist-
ently, the total interaction energy of the unmodified triplet
is only 1.8 kcal/mol away from the DEOpt of the modified
triplet.
Conversely, the optimized geometry of the C13–G22–G46
triplet is somewhat different from that of the C13–G22-m7G46
triplet, with the G13–G22 WC pair in the unmodified triplet
more similar to an isolated G–C WC pair. However, the main
difference is the remarkable elongation, 0.29 s, of the
N2(G46):O6(G13) H-bond in the unmodified triplet. Of
course, these geometrical rearrangements are consequence
of the positive charge on the m7G46 base of the modified
triplet (69). Similar effects are observed when comparing
the charged T54–m1A58/U54–m1A58 pairs with the neutral
T54–A58/U54–A58 pairs (69). The O2(T54/U54):N6(A58)
H-bonds are remarkably longer than in the modified T54–
m1A58/ U54–m1A58 pair. As expected, the stability of the
unmodified and neutral C13–G22–G46 triplet and T54–A58/
U54–A58 pairs is remarkably lower than the stability of the
positively charged modified base triplet and pair, by 17.4 and
6.8/6.2 kcal/mol, respectively.
The unmodified G18–U55 pair is rather similar to the G18–
Y55 pair, although the modified pair is slightly more planar.
Quite different, instead, is the geometry of the unmodified
G26–A44 pair relative to the modified m22G26–A44 pair.
The unmodified pair is quite more planar than the modified
pair, although still propeller twisted. The reason is steric in
nature. In fact, the two additional methyl groups on the N2
atom of m22G26 base force the modified base pair to assume
a more pronounced non-planar geometry to avoid steric
interactions between the CM1(m22G26) and the C2(A44)
atoms. Consequence of the reduced steric repulsion between
the two bases is the shrink of the N1(G26):N1(A44) H-bond.
Nevertheless, the unmodified G26–A44 base pair is only
0.8 kcal/mol more stable than the modified base.
DISCUSSION
Geometries of six out of the nine optimized yeast tRNAPhe
tertiary interactions: A9–U12–A23, C13–G22–m7G46, G18–
Y55, G19–C56, T54–m1A58 and m22G26–A44, reproduce
very well those observed in the best resolution structure
1ehz (Figures 2 and 3). The r.m.s.d. values for the bases
heavy atoms superimposition are indeed within 0.45 s and
H-bond lengths differ for <0.23 s, except for one H-bond in
the T54–m1A58 pair. Consequently, the computed optimized
and rigid body interaction energies DEOpt and DERBI are
very similar. Considering that the DERBI does not take into
account the unfavorable deformation energy term EDef, a more
accurate comparison can be made with the EInter term for
optimized structures. The slight geometrical differences
result here in a change in the energy values that reaches a
maximum of 4.9 kcal/mol for the A9–U12–A23 triplet but can
be as little as 0.4 kcal/mol for the G18–Y55 pair.
These results strongly suggest that the above-mentioned
interactions are held in place mainly by H-bond interactions

between the bases; other forces such as base–backbone inter-
action, base–base stacking and environment effects seem to
play a minor role. Note that this finding holds true in the light
of the analysis of 20 lower resolution cytosolic tRNA struc-
tures (for the Pdb codes list see Materials and Methods).
Optimized structures of G15–C48, U8–A14–A21 and
m2G10–C25–G45 instead do not reproduce those observed
in 1ehz (Figures 2 and 3). As concerns the U8–A14–A21
triplet, the U8–A14 RH pair geometry is very well reproduced
in the optimized structure, whereas the third interacting base
A21 approaches A14 to give an N3-amino H-bond interaction.
The optimized triplet is thus more stable than in 1ehz by
5 kcal/mol. Stabilization given by the additional A14–
A21 N3-amino H-bond can be thus quite easily overcome
with other effects, such as the interaction of bases with
backbone, base–base stacking (A21 participates into a six
purine bases stacking interaction with m7G46, A9, G45,
A44 and G43, Figure 5) or contribution from ions and solvent
molecules or other molecular partners. This is in good agree-
ment with the observation that, of the available standard tRNA
structures, some present such A14–A21 interaction while
others do not. For example, structure of yeast tRNAAsp
(PDB code 2tra) and M.jannaschii tRNALys (PDB code:
1j1u) are quite similar to our optimized structure presenting
the A14-A21 N3-amino H-bond interaction. 1j1u is
shown superimposed to both the optimized and RB 1ehz struc-
ture in Figure 2. The computed DERBI for the A14–A21 inter-
action in the 1j1u and 2tra structures is about 6 kcal/mol,
which is intermediate between the 1ehz DERBI and DEOpt
values.

The cases of G15–C48 pair and m2G10–C25–G45 triplet
are probably the most intriguing. The G15–C48 pair presents
an RWC geometry in the 1ehz structure. However, it is
well known that the isolated G–C RWC pair is not a stable
geometry due to repulsive amino–amino and carbonyl–
carbonyl contacts (35). Indeed, in the fully optimized struc-
ture, we observe a severe geometrical rearrangement which
decreases the amino–amino repulsion, but also breaks the
N2(G15):N3(C48) H-bond of the X-ray structure, dealing to
a bifurcated H-bond pattern (in Figure 3).
The r.m.s.d. for the optimized and X-ray heavy atoms
m2G10–C25–G45 structures superimposition is the highest
observed here, 2.11 s. Also in this case, as for 8–14–21,
the main interacting base pair, the m2G10–C25 WC, is
well superimposable in the two structures. However the
third interacting base G45 assumes a remarkably different
orientation after geometry optimization (Figure 2).
Our results show that the 10–25–45 interaction, as well
as 15–48, although stable (13.8 kcal/mol for the RWC
G15–C48 pair, 8.4 kcal/mol for the interaction of G45
with m2G10–C25), does not represent an energy minimum
when extracted from 1ehz. For both the interactions, geomet-
ries corresponding to the global minima are not compatible
with the overall tRNA structure. However in 1ehz other forces
can contribute to stabilize such geometries. In particular the
effect of stacking interactions, of H-bonded water molecules
and neighbor metal cations, as well as of base–backbone and
backbone–backbone interactions need to be investigated, in
order to explain the observed geometries. That is besides the
purpose of this paper.
Stacking effects seem to play a particularly important role
in maintaining the observed 1ehz G10–C25–G45 geometry.
G45 is indeed closely stacked between nucleotides A9 and
A44, participating in a series of five staggered purine bases
(Figure 5). The nt 9 is known to be a conserved purine in
cytosolic tRNAs (95% of all analyzed cytosolic sequences).
Interestingly, nt 44 is a conserved purine (79%) in class I
tRNA, where nt 45 gives tertiary interaction with the D
stem, whereas it is a pyrimidine (91%) in class II tRNA
where nt 45 instead participates into the additional V stem.
It is commonly accepted that tRNA tertiary interactions
substantially contribute to the tRNA fold stabilization. But,
how much does this contribution amount to? An approximate
estimate for the tertiary base pairing contribution can be
obtained using the rigid body interaction energies (DERBI)
we calculated. By summing the energy contribution from
each tertiary interaction in the yeast tRNAPhe structure, we
obtain a total contribution in terms of base pairing interactions
of 167 kcal/mol (only the stabilization given to the triplet
from the third bases is counted for the 9–12–23, 10–25–45 and
13–22–46 triplets, for instance in the case of A9–U12–A23
only the interaction energy between A9 and the U12–A23 base
pair is considered). This roughly contributes for a remarkable
25% to the total base pairing interaction energies of the
overall yeast tRNAPhe structure, by considering a contribution
of about 450 kcal/mol from the base pairing interactions in
the 1ehz stems [12 G–C WC, 8 A–U WC and 1 G–U Wobble
base pair, our values and Ref. (33)]. Of course, this estimate
can only be considered an approximation since deformation
energies are not included in the DERBI values.
Our calculations indicate that the most stable base pairing
tertiary interaction occurs between the charged m7G46 with
the WC base pair C13–G22. Note that such modification
is observed in 240 out of the 369 analyzed class I tRNA
sequences (65%), while it is totally absent in class II
tRNAs where nt 46 is enclosed in the additional V arm.
This interaction is estimated to contribute 38.0 kcal/mol
to the tRNA structure stabilization. This value can be overes-
timated, owing to the presence of a positive charge not
compensated in the computation by counter ions, solvent
molecules and the ribose-phosphate backbone. However,
the stability of the corresponding unmodified interaction is
still as high as 19.4 kcal/mol.
The second and third most stable interactions are the G19–
C56 WC and T54–m1A58 RH base pairs, with an energy
of 26.8 kcal/mol and 22.5 kcal/mol, respectively. For
the latter a little overestimation due to an uncompensated
charge on the nt 58, analogously to the case of 7mG46, cannot
be excluded. This finding is in good agreement with all
available data. Such interactions indeed, localized at the corner
of the molecule and involving highly conserved nucleotides,
are very well conserved in cytosolic tRNAs, indicating their
importance for the tRNA function. Note also that, among yeast
tRNAPhe tertiary interactions, the G19–C56 pair is the only
canonical WC and that the U54–m1A58 RH pair flanks the
very well conserved U turn motif in the T loop. The functional
and structural relevance of such interactions is also well
documented in literature (9,18,20,21,70). It is worth noting
that the stability of each remaining tertiary base pairing inter-
action, except for A9–U12–A23 and m2G10–C25–G45, is
always comparable with or higher than that of a canonical
WC A–T base pair.
As the effect of chemical modification is concerned, we
investigated six modifications on the five interactions:
m2G10–C25–G45 and C13–G22–m7G46 base triplets,
and G18–Y55, m22G26–A44 and T54–m1A58 base pairs.

Superimposition between the modified and unmodified base
pairs/triplets is reported in Figure 4.
The geometrical effect of the additional methyl on
G10 amino group, as well as on U54 C4 atom, is practically
undetectable. On the contrary, the other investigated chemical
modifications introduce a modest geometrical distortion in the
computed interactions. In particular, the addition of a methyl
group on N7 of m7G46 and on N1 of m1A58, both introducing
a positive charge on the corresponding interaction, particularly
affect the inter-base distances (H-bonds lengths change up to
0.29 s). The C13–G22–m7G46 is indeed the only triplet
where the C13–G22 WC pair is substantially deformed and
destabilized in the triplet as compared with an isolated C–G
WC base pair (Table 4). This can be explained with the elec-
trostatic repulsion between the positively charged m7G46 base
and the partial positive charge on the C13 amino group.
The additional double methyl group on N2 of m22G26
and the isomerization from U55 to Y55 instead both affect
the deviation from planarity of the corresponding G26–A44
and G18–U55 unmodified interactions, enhancing and
decreasing it, respectively. Note that m22G26–A44 is a Cis
WC base pair. Cis A–G WC base-pairs have been widely
investigated in a computational and statistical study (32),
where they were found to be very flexible, being able to
adopt a wide range of low-energy geometries, although
with a clear preference for the propeller twisted conformation
around the O6(G)–N6(A) axis. They occur mostly at the ends
of canonical helices, where they serve as interface with other
motifs introducing conformational flexibility. The G26–A44
interaction thus can introduce structural flexibility in tRNA at
the interface between the AC and D helix, where the pattern of
tertiary base pairing interactions begins. However we showed
that the chemical modification on N2(G26) introduces a
structural constraint which blocks the base pair in a high
propeller twisted conformation, limiting the possible con-
formational flexibility.
The stabilizing effect of the charged m7G46 and m1A58
nucleotides on the C13–G22–m7G46 base triplet and T54–
m1A58/U54–m1A58 pair, as compared with the unmodified
and neutral C13–G22–G46 triplet and T54–A58/U54–A58
pair, is remarkable (17.4 and 6.8/6.2 kcal/mol, respectively)
although possibly overestimated here, as already discussed.
Conversely, the effect of the remaining four investigated
chemical modifications, m2G10, m22G26, T54 and Y55, on
the base pairing interactions stability, is not very significant
(despite of the slight planarity distortion caused by m22G26
and Y55 on the corresponding interactions). In particular
modifications on nucleotides m2G10 and T54 contribute
to the stabilization of the G10–C25–G45 and U54–
m1A58/U54–A58 interactions by a slight 0.9 kcal/mol
and 0.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The effect of m22G26 and
Y55 instead goes in the direction of a destabilization of the
modified interaction by 0.8 and 0.1 kcal/mol for m22G26–A44
and G18–Y55, respectively.
Therefore, of the three investigated modifications
occurring in the T loop, only m1A58 substantially contributes
to the stability of the corresponding base pairing interaction,
whereas T54 does not have a very significant stabilizing effect
(0.7) and Y55 has a negligible destabilizing effect (+0.1).
However, Y55 has been experimentally shown to slightly
enhance the stability of the interaction between the T and
D domains from 6.2 ± 1.6 kcal/mol of the unmodified
T loop to 6.9 ± 2.5 kcal/mol (71). Although results of
our calculations lie within the experimental error, possible
stabilizing contributions of such modified nucleotide could
be ascribed to other factors determining the RNA structure,
different from the base pairing interactions considered here,
for instance the demonstrated base-stacking contribution of
Y in a tRNA base-paired region (72). In the same study a
stabilization effect from 6.2 ± 1.6 to 7.4 ± 2.0 kcal/mol
has been measured for T54, that is in qualitative agreement
with our results. However, also in this case additional contri-
butions from other structural factors cannot be excluded.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper we systematically investigated the stability
of tRNA tertiary interactions focusing on the base pairing
contribution. To this aim we employed advanced quantum
mechanics computational techniques to calculate geometries
and interaction energies for H-bonded base pairs and triplets
corresponding to the nine classical tertiary interactions in the
yeast tRNAPhe model system.
What we learned from this approach is that tRNA tertiary
interactions are mostly inter-base H-bonds driven. Indeed in
only three of the nine analyzed interactions, G15–C48, U8–
A14–A21 and m2G10–C25–G45, other effects from the
context of the overall tRNA structure are needed to explain
the observed geometries. Furthermore, we estimate here that
the tertiary contribution to the overall base pairing tRNA
interaction energy is as high as 25%, with most of the tertiary
base pairing interactions contributing with an energy compar-
able with or higher than that of a canonical WC A–T base pair.
Finally, the effect of chemical modifications on the tertiary
base pairing stability in the analyzed cases has been shown to
range from important for the positively charged m7G46 and
m1A58, to moderate for the additionally methylated neutral
m2G10, m22G26 and T54 and negligible for the isomerized
Y55. With the exception of Y55 and of m22G, they all
stabilize the corresponding base pairing interaction.
