obesity QTL identifies positional candidate gene Sqle and perturbed

genomics.00183.2004.—Obesity-related diseases are poised to be-
come the primary cause of death in developed nations. While a
number of monogenic causes of obesity have recently been identified,
these are responsible for only a small proportion of human cases of
obesity. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies using animal models
have revealed hundreds of potential loci that affect obesity; however,
few have been further analyzed beyond the original QTL scan. We
previously mapped four QTL in an F2 between divergently selected
Fat (F) and Lean (L) lines. A QTL of large effect on chromosome 15
(Fob3) was subsequently mapped to a higher resolution into two
smaller-effect QTL (Fob3a and Fob3b) using crosses between the
F-line and a congenic line containing L-line alleles at the Fob3 QTL
region. Here we report the gene expression characterization of Fob3b.
Microarray expression analysis using the NIA-NIH 15K cDNA array
set containing 14,938 mouse ESTs was employed to identify candi-
date genes and pathways that are differentially expressed between the
F-line and a congenic line containing only the Fob3b QTL (Fob3b-
line). Our study suggests squalene epoxidase (Sqle), a cholesterol
biosynthesis enzyme, as a strong positional candidate gene for Fob3b.
Several other cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes unlinked to
Fob3b were found to be differentially expressed, suggesting that a
perturbation of this pathway could be in part responsible for the
phenotypic difference between the F-line and Fob3b-line mice.
Depdc6; congenic
HUMAN RATES OF OBESITY in the developed world have now
reached epidemic levels, and the global number of overweight
individuals outstrips numbers of underweight cases. This re-
flects the effects of a high-fat food culture, combined with a
genome evolved to efficiently conserve, partition, and store
energy. The human gene map has so far catalogued more than
300 genes, markers, and chromosomal regions that are associ-
ated with human obesity (21). The majority of these are
quantitative trait loci (QTL) for obesity or body weight,
mapped primarily in the mouse (reviewed by Brockmann and
Bevova, Ref. 4) but also in pigs (15) and chickens (9, 18, 25).
A polygenic mouse obesity model has been developed in
Edinburgh by divergent selective breeding that has resulted in
strains differing substantially in fat content (5, 19). The mice
were selected for high-fat (Fat, F-line) or low-fat (Lean, L-line)
content from a genetically highly variable base population for
more than 60 generations (19), resulting in lines that differ
more that fivefold in fat content and have 22% (F-line) or 4%
(L-line) body fat. The lines have subsequently been inbred (5).
These lines, originating from a classic selection experiment on
fat content, therefore represent a resource for genetic dissection
of QTL responsible for the observed selection response. The
phenotypic difference most likely arose via selection of several
loci of low-to-medium effect, rather than a few single-gene
mutations of large effect, and so the genetics of obesity in
these lines model the situation in humans, where a large
proportion of obesity cases are thought to have a polygenic
basis (21).
A genome-wide QTL analysis using the outbred F- and L-lines
identified four QTL regions for fat content that were significant at
a genome-wide level (8). Further research (6) indicated that
variation in the Lep [chromosome (Chr) 4] and Lepr (Chr 6) genes
had not contributed to the selection response. We have since
further mapped and phenotypically characterized the Fob3 QTL
on Chr 15, dissecting it into two smaller-effect QTL, Fob3a and
Fob3b (22). In this study, we report the use of the NIA-NIH 15K
cDNA array set to identify candidate genes and pathways that are
differentially expressed between the parental F-line and a con-
genic line containing the Fob3b QTL region from the L-line
(Fob3b-line). The additive effect of the QTL in the Fob3b-line
peaks at 68 cM (P value  0.006), having an absolute effect of
0.71%  0.26 SD on percentage of body fat (Fat%) (22).
Selection lines and microarrays have been used previously to
identify candidate genes for quantitative traits (26). Similarly,
the use of congenic strains and microarrays in rats has led to
the successful identification of Cd36 as an insulin resistance
gene (1). Here we report the application of congenic mouse
lines derived from selection lines, combined with the applica-
tion of high-throughput gene expression analysis. Candidate
genes are identified by examining differences in gene expres-
sion for loci in the QTL region and by statistical tests of groups
of genes in pathways to circumvent the problem of multiple
statistical testing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). This
analysis highlighted the cholesterol biosynthesis and glycolysis
gene pathways as differentially expressed between the F- and
congenic Fob3b-lines.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Mouse Lines
For a recent review on the original divergently selected F- and
L-lines, see Bu¨nger and Hill (5) and Bu¨nger et al. (6). The generation
of a congenic line encompassing the Fob3b QTL region has been
described previously in Stylianou et al. (22), and it is named the
Fchr15LD congenic line; here this line is referred to as Fob3b-line for
simplicity. The Fob3b-line has L-line alleles between D15Mit184 and
D15Mit107 on Chr15 (43.1 cM), and the rest of the genome is of the
F-line background (99.2%), introduced via seven generations of
recurrent backcrossing.
Mouse Tissue Collection
Mice were fed ad libitum Rat and Mouse No. 3 diet [Special Diet
Services, Essex, UK; digestible crude (dc) oil, 3.8%; dc protein,
20.2%; starches, 33.9%; sugars, 4.4%; digestible energy, 13.8 MJ/kg]
from weaning onward and maintained with controlled lighting (12:
12-h light-dark cycle) at a temperature of 21  2°C. Mice were
weaned at 21 days of age and kept in sex-matched groups in plastic
cages. All procedures were authorized and approved by the Home
Office (UK) under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Only female mice from the three lines (F-, L-, and Fob3b-lines) were
used in this study. From weaning onward, mice were maintained on
the same rack, and cages were randomized in their position on the rack
after each cage change to minimize localized environmental effects.
At 98 days of age (1 day), mice were transferred into individually
labeled cages with water but no food for 3 h at 0800. If 10 mice
were to be dissected in 1 day, the first 10 would be isolated at 0800
and next 10 at 0900, thus maintaining a 3-h isolation period. For each
line, a total of 10 mice from 3 litters were dissected, and the order in
which litters were dissected was randomized. These procedures at-
tempted to standardize gene expression differences that might arise
between mice because of prekill eating. Each mouse was transported
individually from the stock room to the dissecting room and then
processed, typically within 5 min. Mice were cervically dislocated and
decapitated, and tissues were removed, one at a time. All tissues were
transferred to 2-ml Eppendorf tubes, immediately snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and then stored at 80°C. All nondisposable dissect-
ing instruments were autoclaved before use, and all disposable instru-
ments used were sterile.
RNA Isolation
RNA extraction was carried out using TRIzol reagent following the
manufacturer’s guidelines (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Briefly, samples
were homogenized, using a Polytron homogenizer (PT100, Kine-
matica Polytron), for 30 s to 2 min depending on tissue type and
volume. This was carried out in “batches” appropriate to the down-
stream pairwise comparisons. RNA samples were quantified by mea-
suring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (GeneQuant; Amersham Bio-
sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and the integrity of samples was
assessed by ethidium bromide staining.
Microarrays
Microarray slides were supplied by the Human Genome Mapping
Project (HGMP) Resource Center (Hinxton, UK). Spotted on the
slides were 14,938 mouse cDNAs from a clone set prepared by Dr.
Minoru Ko’s laboratory (24) at the National Institute on Aging (NIA)
of the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD). Overall,
67% (574 different ESTs) of all the known transcripts in the Fob3b
region are represented on the arrays. The 14,938 cDNAs are spotted
across two slides [referred to as slide set 1 (1–7,612) and slide set 2
(7,613–14,938)], each containing 7,500 different cDNAs spotted
twice on each slide. Clones were sequenced from 5- and 3-termini,
and the sequences were deposited in GenBank (24). This information
is available at the NIA-NIH web site (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/
cDNA/15k.html). All ESTs are referred to here by their 5-sequence
GenBank accession numbers.
Target Preparation: Array Hybridization, Washing, and Scanning
Targets were prepared with Klenow fragment by the method
described in Smith et al. (20). Similarly, procedures for hybridization
and slide washing were performed as described previously (20). For
liver tissue hybridizations, for each slide set, two self-self (F-line:F-
line and Fob3b-line:Fob3b-line) and four cross-line hybridizations
(F-line:Fob3b-line) were performed. The self-self hybridizations were
performed to examine intraline variability, but analysis indicated that
this was at a low level. The data from the self-self hybridizations were
also incorporated in the mixed model analysis described below. For
brown adipose tissue (BAT), no self-self hybridizations were per-
formed because RNA was limiting. The four cross-line hybridizations
are essentially replicates involving two independent pools of RNA for
both lines (each pool generated from 5 individual mice, hence a total
of 10 mice for each line from 3 different first-parity litters) and dye
swaps.
Northern Analysis
Northern analysis was carried out to confirm differential expression
and to further characterize ESTs identified from the microarray
experiments. Clones representing the differentially expressed ESTs
(see Table 2) were obtained from the HGMP (http://www.hgmp.
mrc.ac.uk/geneservice/index.shtml). Probes were prepared by ex-
traction from agarose gel slices, following restriction endonuclease
digestion of plasmid clones. Probe labeling was performed using the
Rediprime II DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences), accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Probes were purified with
Sephadex G50 Nick columns (Amersham Biosciences).
Total RNA (10 g) was loaded onto 1% denaturing formamide
agarose gels, and integrity of RNA was examined by ethidium
bromide staining. Gels were capillary transferred onto nylon mem-
brane and fixed by UV light. Each Northern blot membrane was
prewetted in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and prehybridized for
1 h at 65°C in 20 ml of 0.5 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing
7% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 25 g/ml
denatured tRNA. Hybridization was carried out in glass bottles rotat-
ing in a Biometra OV5 (Goettingen, Germany) hybridization oven.
Washed membranes were exposed overnight at 80°C to Kodak
BIOMAX-MS film (Amersham Biosciences). Where signals were
weak, exposure time was extended accordingly.
Data Analysis
The raw data files have been deposited into the Gene Expression Om-
nibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/?accGSE1558; series
GSE1558, platform GPL1341–1342, arrays GSM26714–26733).
The significance of differential expression in liver and BAT be-
tween the F- and Fob3b-mouse lines was assessed for all 14,938 ESTs
by use of a mixed model procedure coded in SAS (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). This was done for all four experiments, that is, liver
cDNAs on the first and second array sets and BAT cDNAs on the first
and second array sets. The mixed model is adapted from Kerr and
Churchill (10) and is processed in two steps, based on the procedures
described by Wolfinger et al. (27). The full model is given in Eq. 1

where Yadgilps is the normalized log2 background-corrected measure-
ment for any EST g;  represents the average background-corrected
signal across all the factors in the experiment; D is a fixed dye effect

array; AD is the dye-by-array interaction; and ADI is the dye-by-
array-by-grid interaction. Gene (G)-specific interactions include the
line (L)-by-gene interaction (LG), where L is the fixed line effect (l:
F-line or Fob3b-line); the array-by-gene interaction (AG); the dye-
by-gene interaction (DG); the pool-by-gene interaction (PG); and the
spot-by-array-by-gene interaction (SAG). e is the stochastic error.
Equation 1 is broken down into two components. The first component
is a global normalization to remove array, dye, pool, and grid effects
using an analysis over all genes (Eq. 2)
Yadip  Aa Dd Pp ADad ADIadi eadpi (2)
The residuals from step 1 (Radip) are obtained by subtracting the fitted
values for the effects from the Yadip values. The next component of
Eq. 1 is an EST-specific ANOVA (Eq. 3) using the residuals obtained
from Eq. 2, allowing a different variance for each gene. All the effects
here are indexed by g and hence are EST-specific effects (as opposed
to the global effects modeled in Eq. 2).
Radglps Llg Aag Ddg Ppg SAsag εadglps (3)
SA interaction is introduced to account for the double spotting of each
EST on each array; adglps is the stochastic error for each EST.
Because the goal is to assess the EST-specific line (L) effect, the
estimates of primary interest are those of the Llg effects. Differences
between these effects are tested by use of mixed model-based t-tests
of all possible pairwise comparisons within an EST.
Filtering for Significant Differentially Expressed ESTs
ESTs were ranked by P values calculated from the mixed model
analysis. For each array, 7,680 independent tests were carried out (1
slide set at a time), so the 	 level was corrected with the Bonferroni
adjustment to generate a conservative experiment-wide threshold,
hence, 0.05/7,680, which reduces the 	 for each test to 0.00000651
(6.51 
 106).
This experiment-wide threshold is extremely stringent and may
result in many false negatives. To circumvent this problem, we
employed Mann-Whitney U-tests to perform pairwise comparisons of
the P values of groups of genes. The null hypothesis is that the sums
of the ranks of the groups do not differ (allowing for differences in
sample sizes). The pairs of exclusive sets of ESTs tested were within
or outside specific pathways or within or outside the QTL 95%
confidence interval (CI).
Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed to confirm
known genes identified as differentially expressed from the array
analysis. Design of primers was carried out by use of the Primer3 (16)
software, available online at http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/
primer3/primer3_www.cgi, using sequences that were selected from
the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium Mouse Assembly (build
30). The rodent mispriming library was chosen as a constraint for
improved primer design. Additionally, RNA samples were DNase
treated with DNase-free (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
The First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) was
used for first-strand cDNA synthesis, using RNA pooled from five
individual mice. SYBR Green Q-PCR was performed using a kit
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence
Detector (PerkinElmer) with accompanied software (Sequence Detec-
tor v1.6.3). Reactions were carried out on 96-well MicroAmp optical
plates and caps (Applied Biosystems). For each reaction, four identi-
cal (systematic) replicates were carried out. For each gene examined,
identical reactions were processed on the same 96-well plate with
primers for the mouse -actin gene to normalize for variation in
loading between samples (CT). For each gene, dilution compari-
sons were performed between the gene under investigation and the
control (-actin) to establish the working concentration.
RESULTS
In the microarray experiment, we compared expression pro-
files between the F- and congenic Fob3b-lines in liver and
BAT for 14,938 mouse ESTs. We first analyzed ESTs on Chr
15, in particular ESTs that map to the Fob3b QTL region to
identify positional candidate genes that show differential ex-
pression between the F- and Fob3b-lines. We next sought to
identify perturbed pathways containing genes that map within
or outside the Fob3b region. Finally, the expression differences
of candidates identified as being differentially expressed in the
microarray analysis were verified by the Northern or Q-PCR
assays.
Analysis of Chr 15 and the Fob3b QTL Interval
Across the two slides, 145 different ESTs (67 on slide set 1
and 78 on slide set 2) mapping to the Fob3b 95% CI were
spotted on the arrays (Fig. 1). The P values of these ESTs were
compared with those outside the QTL region (of each slide set)
using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The analysis shows little
evidence that the ESTs in the 95% CI of the Fob3b QTL region

adipose tissue (BAT; solid diamonds) and liver (shaded trian-
gles) on mouse chromosome (Chr) 15. ESTs are shown with
map position on Chr 15.

have P values differing from all other ESTs; there is only weak
evidence in liver: slide set 2 (P  0.044; Table 1).
ESTs mapping to Chr 15 were ranked according to P value,
and known genes were examined for their involvement in
known pathways at the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and
Genomes (www.genome.ad.jp/kegg).
Characterized genes. Two ESTs corresponding to charac-
terized Chr 15 genes were identified as potential candidates for
further investigation. BG074498 corresponds to thiosulfate
transferase (Tst) and is downregulated in BAT of the F-line,
relative to the Fob3b-line. BG077950 corresponds to squalene
epoxidase (Sqle), ranks highly in both tissues, and is upregu-
lated in the F-line (Table 2, top, and Fig. 1). Tst maps just distal
to the Fob3b 95% CI, whereas Sqle maps within this interval,
which, along with its differential expression and its involve-
ment in the metabolic pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis,
makes Sqle a strong positional candidate for Fob3b.
Uncharacterized genes. Four differentially expressed Chr 15
ESTs, BG081526, BG068787, BG063349, and BG066896,
corresponding to uncharacterized genes were identified as
having low P values. The highest ranking is BG081526; it has
very low P values in both tissues examined (Table 2, bottom,
and Fig. 1). BG066896 shows a low P value in BAT and has
a sequence that maps 1,500 bp from BG081526, suggesting
that it may be part of the same gene. BG081526 maps close to
the proximal end of the Fob3b 95% CI (Fig. 1). Given that both
BG063349 (low P value in BAT) and BG068787 (low P value
in liver) map outside the Fob3b QTL region, these ESTs from
unknown genes have not been further investigated within this
study.
Analysis of Sqle and the Cholesterol Biosynthesis Pathway
Given that Sqle was found to be differentially expressed,
mapping to the Fob3b region, and is involved in the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway, other genes of this pathway were exam-
ined. Of the 13 possible enzymes involved in converting
hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A into cholesterol, 10
had ESTs that were spotted on the arrays, and 8 were upregu-
lated in the F-line (P  0.05, uncorrected) as summarized in
Table 3.

strong evidence that the ESTs in this pathway tend to show
lower P values (for both tissues; liver slide set 1, P 

second slide set are nonsignificant, presumably because there

(Eno1), on Chr 2 had a very low P value, ranking as the 14th
most significant EST (P  0.0000068, uncorrected). This gene
is involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway. Exam-
ination of ESTs matching the genes for enzymes in the glyco-
lysis and gluconeogenesis pathways revealed several points.
First, the two gluconeogenesis-specific genes spotted on the
arrays are not differentially expressed (P  0.05; Table 4),
suggesting that gluconeogenesis might not be affected by
Fob3b. Second, 7 of the 10 genes coding for enzymes involved
in glycolysis are spotted on the array, and of these 6 are
differentially expressed in BAT (P  0.05, uncorrected).
However, there is no differential expression in liver, the site of
gluconeogenesis. We carried out a Mann-Whitney U-test to
compare the ranks of the P values for glycolysis and glucone-
ogenesis ESTs against ESTs outside these pathways. This
confirms that ESTs in the glycolysis pathway tend to show
more significant P values, especially in BAT (BAT slide set 1,
P  0.00012; liver slide set 2, P  0.017; Table 1). The
gluconeogenesis-specific ESTs and those shared with the gly-
colysis pathway are not significantly different from the remain-
ing genes.
Other Chr 15 Candidates
Previously, we reported a search for candidate genes based
on the flanking markers of the 95% CIs for the Fob3b QTL
(22). Of the candidates that were identified in this region, four
had corresponding ESTs spotted on the arrays: Sqle has been
shown to be differentially expressed; however, three others,
Ndufb9, Myc, and Dgat1, were not differentially expressed
(P  0.05; Fig. 2).
Q-PCR Analysis
Of the two potential candidate pathways identified, we
focused on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. The reasons
for this are that Sqle, a cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme, maps
within the Fob3b QTL region (Fig. 1), and that several other
pathway genes have small P values and large fold changes
(Table 3) and are all upregulated in the F-line. Consequently,
Q-PCR was performed on Sqle and Lss (which has both a small
P value and a large fold change). Additionally, analysis was
performed on the gene sterol regulatory-binding factor-2
(Srebf2), since no EST for this gene was spotted on the arrays,
and the gene is a transcriptional regulator of cholesterol bio-
synthesis genes (13, 17) that maps to Chr 15 (83.7 Mb), close
to Fob3b. The Q-PCR results confirm the differential expres-
sion of both Lss and Sqle, with almost identical fold changes as
those observed in the array analysis. In addition, a significant
differential expression of Srebf2 was detected (see Fig. 3A).
Confirmation of differential expression of the candidate
genes was firstly performed with pooled RNA. The F-, L-, and
congenic Fob3b-lines used are inbred, so averaging over pools

averages their environmental effects, and our statistical and
methodological approach limits environmental variation.
Therefore, the use of pools for confirmation of the array
candidates in RNA-limiting tissues such as BAT and white
adipose tissue (WAT) is robust. However, RNA from liver
tissue was not limiting, and so further confirmation was per-
formed using unpooled RNA from individual mice. RT-PCR
was performed on four individuals for each line, each with
three technical replicates for the genes Sqle, Lss, and Srebf2. In
these four individuals, we again see results similar to those
observed in the pooled RT-PCR samples and microarray anal-
ysis (Fig. 3B and Table 5). The differences observed in the
individuals are significantly different for Sqle (P  0.002) and
Lss (P  0.009) and approach significance for Srebf2 (P 
0.07).
Downstream Northern Expression Analyses of
Uncharacterized Chr 15 Candidates BG081526 and
BG066896
We performed Northern analysis on two uncharacterized
Chr 15 ESTs (BG081526 and BG066896) that showed
differential expression in the microarray analysis. This as-
say examined tissue, time course, and possible alternative
splice variants that might exist for genes corresponding to
these ESTs. Q-PCR analysis indicated that BG081526 and
BG066896 belong to the same transcription unit (data not
shown). Hybridization of Northern blots with the BG081526
EST clone as a probe indicates that the transcript is 8 kb
in size, with a possible 7-kb-long alternative transcript seen
in WAT (Fig. 4). Of 16 different tissues examined, expres-
sion was observed in all (except the pancreas), with varying
degrees of abundance. Generally, BG081526 is downregu-
lated in all L-line and Fob3b-line tissues compared with the
F-line tissues, with the lowest amount of expression in
L-line tissues. Time series Northern analysis at time points
of 28, 49, and 98 days of age indicates an early upregulation
of this gene in the F-line relative to both the Fob3b-line and
the L-line, which is particularly noticeable in WAT (Fig. 4).
Sequence analysis reveals two protein domains of unknown
function (DEP domains), leading to the preliminary gene
name for the BG081526-associated gene of Depdc6 (Dep
domain containing 6). BLAST analysis (nucleotide and
translated amino acid sequence) of the BG081526 sequence
was performed against the genomic sequences of various
species. Depdc6 appears to be a highly conserved gene, with
orthologs in the human and rat genomes having 88 and 95%
nucleotide similarity, respectively. There is also evidence of
homologous sequences in species as diverse as fugu, ze-
brafish, and fruitfly, but not in the worm Caenorhabditis
elegans.
DISCUSSION
The final goal of a QTL study is to identify the molecular
basis for the QTL effect(s). In the present study, we focused
on the Fob3b QTL by performing a microarray-based ex-
pression experiment with the aim of identifying possible
positional candidates and metabolic pathways that may be
involved in the Fob3b QTL. Microarray analysis enabled
examination of the expression profiles of a large number of
genes, providing data on 67% of all known transcripts in the
Fob3b region and elsewhere in the genome. Although a
large proportion of the genes in this region are represented
on the arrays, the genes that are not represented may also be
as important for the QTL effect. Our search for pathways
may point to genes that are involved, but not represented on
the arrays. Of the 14,938 different ESTs spotted on the
arrays, a number of differentially expressed candidates were
identified. Differentially expressed positional candidate
genes as well as two perturbed metabolic pathways have
been uncovered, providing essential information to speed up
future positional cloning efforts of this QTL.
An ongoing issue related to microarray analysis is the
criteria used to determine significance of differentially ex-
pressed genes. Under our analysis, each EST was examined
in two tissues (liver and BAT), leading to 30,000 tests.
Thirteen ESTs were found to meet the conservative Bonfer-
onni experiment-wide 0.05 significance threshold; however,
all of these are from uncharacterized genes. And 2,491 tests
were significant at the nominal 0.05 threshold, a figure far
higher than the 1,500 expected under the null hypothesis
(note, however, that this does not represent 2,491 different
ESTs, since some were significant in both tissues). How-
ever, by grouping the ESTs into pathways and comparing

the ranks of their P values with a nonparametric test, we
were able to show significant differential expression for
these groups of genes, even though at the single gene level
the P values do not meet the Bonferonni experiment-wide
significance threshold.
Chow-based diets have been shown previously (11) to con-
tain inconsistent proportions of fatty acids among batches.
Although we have used a robust statistical analysis and have
been able to replicate our results in multiple biological repli-
cates, these potential inconsistencies could affect the gene
expression of the metabolic genes in the pathways discussed
here. Future analyses can examine the impact of different diets,
and batches can be analyzed by gas chromatography for con-
sistency of fatty acids.
Sqle and the Cholesterol Biosynthesis Pathway Genes
When all the genes known to be involved in the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway were examined, 8 of 10 that were spotted
on the arrays were significant at the nominal level (P  0.01).
Given that Sqle, which maps within the Fob3b region, is also
significantly differentially expressed at the nominal level, the
evidence for this pathway being associated with this QTL is
compelling. Interestingly, not all the genes were significantly
differentially expressed in both tissues, which may indicate
that the Fob3b action is different for some genes in this
pathway in the two examined tissues.
Sqle catalyses the first oxygenation step in sterol biosyn-
thesis and is thought to strongly influence the flux through
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Differences in choles-
terol biosynthesis may be associated with the Fob3b obesity
QTL in several ways. For instance, the causative genomic
alteration(s) resulting in the Fob3b QTL effect (Fob3b allele
for simplicity) may act to increase cholesterol biosynthesis
in the F-line, resulting in a higher level of cholesterol
deposition in adipose cells and increased adiposity (2, 12).
Alternatively, the causative Fob3b allele may be acting on
increased cholesterol biosynthesis in the F-line, which then
acts as an activator of fatty acid synthesis that in turn results

in increased obesity (3, 14). Finally, the target of the
causative Fob3b allele that leads to obesity may be entirely
independent of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and
yet the expression of the cholesterol biosynthesis genes are
perturbed because they share a common transcription factor.
Such a scenario may be demonstrated by the Srebf2 tran-
scription factor, which has been shown to act on the cho-
lesterol biosynthesis genes as well as on fatty acid synthase
(Fasn) and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 2 (Scd2), each
of which have been shown to give rise to obesity indepen-
dently (23).
Q-PCR on two genes from the cholesterol biosynthesis
pathway, Sqle and Lss, confirmed the results obtained from
the array analysis, in that Sqle and Lss were both upregu-
lated in the F-line relative to Fob3b-line (and the L-line).
Confirmation was performed using the original pooled sam-
ples used for array analysis, and on liver samples from four
individual mice for each line. The transcription factor
Srebf2 that was absent from the arrays, yet maps to Chr 15,
was also investigated for its known regulator properties of
the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (13, 17).
Differential expression of Srebf2 was observed, indicating
that Srebf2 may be responsible for the gene expression
differences observed in Sqle, Lss, and the accompanying
cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes.
Additional Differentially Expressed Candidates and Genes
Eno1 was identified as the most significant differentially
expressed characterized gene, upregulated in BAT tissue of
the F-line relative to the congenic Fob3b-line. Eno1 is
involved in the glycolysis pathway. When other genes in the
same pathway were examined, it was determined that four
additional glycolysis genes (Gpi, Pfk, AldoA, and Tpi) were
significant at the nominal level (P  0.05), bringing the total
to six of a possible eight that were spotted on the arrays.
None of the eight genes was significantly different in liver
tissue, indicating that this may be a pathway that is per-
turbed in a tissue-specific manner. The individual P values
for each of the four genes, Gpi, Pfk, AldoA, and Tpi, are
below the genome-wide significance threshold, so each
would have been disregarded with the use of stringent
selection thresholds; however, when considered together by
a nonparametric test as part of the glycolysis pathway, the
evidence for their differential expression is strengthened.
Increased expression of the glycolysis pathway genes in the
F-line could lead to a greater rate of production of the end
product, acetyl-CoA, which is a precursor for both choles-
terol biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis.
In addition to identifying candidate pathways, a few unchar-
acterized ESTs were also identified and some verified with
follow-up expression studies. We chose the BG081526 EST
mapping close to the Fob3b interval on Chr 15 as the most
promising uncharacterized candidate to confirm and further
characterize, since it was highly differentially expressed in
both liver and BAT.
Differential expression of the BG081526 EST, indicated
by the array analysis, was confirmed by Northern analysis
and shows that the BG081526 EST belongs to an 8-kb
transcript whose gene is currently named Depdc6 (DEP
domain containing 6). Depdc6 is upregulated in all F-line
tissues relative to Fob3b- and L-line tissues, and the differ-
ences are apparent from an early stage (28 days). The
reported 2 kb of sequence are entirely unique, having no
similarity to any gene family, and are highly conserved,
while 6 kb of the cDNA sequence remain unidentified. Full
gene characterization and further analysis of Depdc6 are
ongoing. Although Depdc6 may not be the prime candidate
for Fob3b given its map position, it may be interesting to
determine why this gene of unknown function is so highly
differentially expressed in our lines; it may be that it is a
downstream target of the causal Fob3b allele.
Given that, of all the differentially expressed cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway genes, Sqle maps within the Fob3b
QTL region, this makes Sqle a strong candidate for the
Fob3b QTL. It is therefore possible that a genomic alter-
ation of Sqle in the F-line results in an allele that is
responsible for the QTL effect. However, given that the
confidence interval of Fob3b is still relatively large (26
Mb), it could also be that other linked genes are causal for
the Fob3b QTL effect and that expression of Sqle is some-
how influenced by the action of this linked QTL. In addition,
existence of multiple smaller-effect QTL (7) within the
currently mapped Fob3b region resulting in a “cumulative”
Fob3b effect cannot be ruled out. Further high-resolution
genetic mapping studies combined with detailed expression
(RNA and protein) analysis of cholesterol biosynthesis path-
way, determination of Sqle polymorphisms between the
lines, and possibly transgenic studies (i.e., allele replace-
ment) are needed to finally identify the molecular cause of
the Fob3b effect.
