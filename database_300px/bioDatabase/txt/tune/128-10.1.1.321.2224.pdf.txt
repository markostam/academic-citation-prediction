ABSTRACT
Drug sensitivity assays were performed using a variation of a colori
metrie [3-{4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT)1 assay on V79, CHO-AuxBl, CH"C5, NCI-H460, and NCI-
H249 cell lines following optimization of experimental conditions for
each cell line. Results from this assay were compared with data assimi
lated simultaneously by clonogenic assay and by dye exclusion assay.
Good correlation was observed using the CHO-AuxBl cell line and the
pleiotropic drug-resistant mutant CH"C5, with similar degrees of relative
resistance observed with both the M l'I and clonogenic assays. Good
correlation was observed between the clonogenic and M l'I assays for I-
h drug exposures, although the MIT assay was more sensitive to
vinblastine. In general, the clonogenic assay was more sensitive when
continuous drug exposures were utilized, although this was primarily
related to the increased drug exposure time. While the use of the MIT
assay in drug sensitivity testing of primary tumor samples is limited,
since contaminating normal cells may also reduce the tetrazolium, theM I'I assay can be semiautomated, and therefore it offers a valid, simple
method of assessing Chemosensitivity in established cell lines.
INTRODUCTION
Clonogenic assays (1) have been used extensively in the
assessment of Chemosensitivity of both established tumor cell
lines (2) and freshly biopsied tumor tissue (3, 4). Low plating
efficiencies, clumping artifacts, and assay duration are technical
problems that limit the wide spread applicability of clonogenic
assays on human tumor material (5-7). In an attempt to over
come the limitations of the clonogenic assay, a number of short-
term assays have been developed, including dye exclusion tech
niques (8), initiated thymidine uptake (9), radiolabeled glucose
utilization (10), and automated image analysis of crystal violet-
stained cells (11). However, there are conflicting views regard
ing the comparability of these assays to the clonogenic assay
(12-15).
Recently, changes have been proposed in the National Cancer
Institute's anticancer drug screening program. The first involves
the use of human tumor cell lines in a disease-oriented approach
(16). Thus, a large panel of human lung cancer lines represent
ing the major histolÃ³gica! types (including non-small cell and
small cell lung cancer) will be screened. The second involves
the use of a colorimetrie assay based on the ability of live but
not dead tumor cells to reduce a tetrazolium-based compound
(MTT3) to a blue forma/an product. Chemosensitivity assays
using tetrazolium dyes have been widely reported (17, 18) and

are in current use in Japan. With modification this assay is
attractive in that it can be semiautomated (19), because the
assay can be performed in 96-well plates, with MTT formazan
production analyzed using a scanning multi well spectrotometer.
Thus large numbers of samples can be analyzed simply and
rapidly. Recently, further modification of this assay has been
reported (20). However, comparison of the MTT assay with
other assays is essential prior to its use in large scale screening
studies. Therefore, direct comparisons were made between the
clonogenic, dye exclusion, and MTT assays utilizing both non-
small cell and small cell lung cancer cell lines. In addition
Chinese hamster V79 cells and 2 Chinese hamster ovary cell
lines, the wild type AuxBl and its pleiotropic drug mutant
CHRC5 (21), were also tested. These cell lines were assessed
for sensitivity to a range of cytotoxic drugs and to radiation,
with the details of the radiation experiments described in the
following article (22). First we discovered the need to signifi
cantly modify the previously described MTT assay (19) to allow
for better solubilization of the formazan product. Using this
modification we were then able to show that the MTT assay
gives results comparable to those of the clonogenic and dye
exclusion assays for lung cancer and Chinese hamster cells.
Based on these studies it appears reasonable to use the MTT
assay for new drug screening.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines
Hamster Cell Lines. Chinese hamster lung fÃ-broblastV79 cells were
grown as a monolayer in Ham's F 12 medium (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Exponen
tially growing cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2-9S% air at 37'C, and under these conditions the plating
efficiency was 70-90% and the doubling time was 9-10 h. Two Chinese
hamster ovary cell lines kindly provided by Dr. V. Ling were used:
CHO-AuxBl and its pleiot topically drug-resistant mutant CHRCS (21).
These two lines were grown as monolayers under the same conditions
as for V79 cells, and plating efficiencies in both cell lines ranged from
60 to 75%. Under these conditions doubling times were 13-15 h for
CHO-AuxBl and 22 h for CHRC5.
Human Lung Cancer Cell Lines. Two human lung cancer cell lines
were used: NCI-H249, a small cell lung cancer, and NCI-H460, a large
cell lung carcinoma cell line. Exponentially growing cultures of both
cell lines were grown in RI'M I 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and were maintained
in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2-93% air at 37'C. NCI-H460
grew as a monolayer with a doubling time of 20-25 h and plating
efficiency of 50-70%, whereas NCI-H249 grew as floating aggregates
(23), with a doubling time of 85 h and cloning efficiency in soft agar of

Single cell suspensions were obtained by mechanical disaggregation
of the floating cell line and by trypsinization of monolayer cultures,

mitochondria! dehydrogenase of viable cells to a blue formazan product
which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Following appropriate
incubation of cells, with or without drug, 0.1 mg (50 n\ of 2 mg/ml)
MTT was added to each well and incubated at 37Â°Cfor a further 4 h
before processing as described below. To determine the relationship of
cell number to MTT formazan crystal formation increasing cell num
bers from 100 to 100,000/well were plated, using V79, NCI-H460, and
NCI-H249 cells. MTT was immediately added and plates were incu
bated for 4 h. Plates were then processed as described and absorbance
was determined. For cell growth studies, serially increasing cell numbers
were plated in different columns across 96-well microtiter plates. Actual
cell number was measured daily by removing cells from individual wells
at each cell concentration. Cell counts were performed using a panicle
counter, with all measurements carried out in triplicate. Identical plates
were processed daily using MTT, measuring absorbance with a scanning
ululimeli spectrophotometer (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
reader; Biotek Instruments, Inc., Burlington, VT).
Growth rates varied between the cell lines used; therefore, the number
of cells plated was adjusted so that untreated cells were in exponential
growth phase at the time of harvest. An incubation time of 4 days was
selected for a number of reasons: (a) this allowed sufficient time for
drug-induced cell death to occur; (b) this enabled us to directly compare
results of this assay with data assimilated by dye exclusion assay, which
has been widely used in this laboratory; and (c) by keeping the incuba
tion time short, this obviated the need to refeed cells, maximizing the
benefit of the automation of the assay. In view of the rapid doubling
time of V79 cells, a 72-h incubation was considered optimal, because
longer incubation times would have necessitated the seeding of less
than 100 cells to ensure logarithmic growth at the end of the experi
ment.
Assays were performed using both 1-h and continuous exposure to
drugs. For continuous exposure studies, equal numbers of cells were
inoculated into each well in 0.18 ml of culture medium, to which 0.02
ml of lux concentrated drug or phosphate-buffered saline was added.
For 1-h exposure, drugs and cells were mixed in 15 x 75-mm test tubes,
and following incubation, cells were centrifugad at 250 x g for 5 min,
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then plated directly
into microtiter plates. Following incubation the media from plates
containing adherent cells was aspirated completely, whereas for the
floating cell line, NCI-H249, plates were centrifuged at 450 x g for 5
min in a plate holder. The majority of the media was then aspirated,
taking care not to disturb the formazan crystals, leaving approximately
30 pi of media in each well. All results represent the average of a
minimum of 8 wells. Surviving fraction or fractional absorbance was
calculated by the formula: mean of test sample â€¢+â€¢mean of untreated
sample. Additional controls consisted of media alone with no cells,
with or without the various drugs.
Using the procedure described by Mosmann (19) with acid isopropyl
alcohol as solvent, we were unable to achieve solubilization of the
formazan crystals, and minimal absorbance was detected at 570 nm. A
modification of this technique has recently been described (20). How
ever, because it is proposed to use this assay for human tumor cell line
screening, this modification was far from ideal. Many of these cells
require serum for optimal growth and a number grow as floating
aggregates, not in monolayer culture. Various solvents were then tested,
the best of which proved to be DMSO (Sigma) or mineral oil, although
the latter was successful only when all the media could be removed
from the wells. Absorbance spectra for these solvents revealed absor
bance peaks at 503 nm and 565 nm for DMSO and mineral oil,
respectively. Because mineral oil is relatively nontoxic, it was used as
the solvent of choice for adherent cultures. Because all the medium
could not be removed from floating cell cultures, DMSO was used to
solubilize the formazan crystals. The plates containing mineral oil were
allowed to stand overnight at 40Â°C,prior to reading on an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. DMSO
plates were placed on a plate shaker for 5 min and read immediately at
540 nm.
Dye Exclusion Assay
These experiments were carried out using the procedure described
by Weisenthal et al. (8). All experiments were performed using contin
uous exposure to drugs, with triplicate assays used at all drug concen
trations. Cells were collected as described for MTT assays and counted
using a particle counter. Optimal seeding concentrations, to obtain
approximately 5 x IO4cells at the time of harvest, were 500 cells/tube
for V79, 2,500 cells/tube for NCI-H460, and 10,000 cells/tube for
NCI-H249. Appropriate cell numbers were then transferred into conical
polypropylene tubes, with and without drug, and incubated at 37Â°Cfor
3 days in view of the rapid doubling time in experiments using V79
cells, or 4 days for all other cell lines. Following incubation, 50,000
aldehyde-fixed duck RBC were added to each tube and the cells were
concentrated to a volume of 0.2 ml by centrifugation at 250 x g for 5
min. The tubes were then vortexed, 0.2 ml of a 1% fast green-0.5%
nigrosin solution was added, and tubes were again vortexed. After 10
min of incubation, cell suspensions were vortexed and cytocentrifuged
at 1,200 x g for 7 min. The cell discs were then fixed in methanol and
counters! ained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cells were counted at X400
using a light microscope. The viable (hematoxylin-eosin-stained) tumor
cell/duck RBC ratio was determined for each treatment group and
compared to control values.
Clonogenic Assay
Clonogenic assays were performed in standard fashion, using previ
ously described techniques (3,24,25). Drug treatment was administered
either by 1-h exposure, following which cells were rinsed free of drug
using phosphate-buffered saline prior to plating, or by continuous
exposure, with triplicate cultures plated at each drug concentration.
Adherent cell lines were plated directly onto IVIri dishes and incubated
with or without drug for variable times, dependent on the growth rate
of the cells. One hundred V79 cells were incubated for control plates,
with higher cell numbers used for treated samples to give at least 50
colonies and plates incubated for 6 days. Incubation times were 7 days
for CHO cell lines and 10 days for NCI-H460 cells. For these cell lines
control plates were inoculated with 250 cells/dish, with higher cell
numbers used for drug-treated samples. Colonies were fixed in metha-
nohacetic acid (3:1), stained with crystal violet, and counted using a
microscope at x40. For all clonogenic assays colonies of greater than
50 cells were counted, with cell inocula of 5 x IO4cells or less plated
on 60-mm l'etri dishes and larger cell inocula plated on 101)nini l'etri
dishes. NCI-H249, the floating cell line, was suspended in 0.3% agar
and plated onto a feeder layer of 0.6% agar, with the medium used in
both agar layers consisting of RPMI 1640 plus 10% (v/v) fetal calf
serum. Experiments were performed using 3 ml for each agar layer in
60-mm dishes and 8 ml for each agar layer in 100-mm dishes, with all
plates incubated for 18 days.
Drugs
All drugs were obtained from commercial sources apart from mel-
phalan which was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry
Branch of the National Cancer Institute. Drugs were prepared every 2
months and stored at lOOOx concentrations at â€”70Â°C,apart from
melphalan which was prepared freshly for each experiment.
Study Design
All three assays were set up simultaneously for each cell line, using
the same drug solutions. For 1-h drug exposure, cells were incubated
with drug in a test tube, then washed free of drug, and plated directly
in both Pet ri dishes and 96-well plates. Survival or fractional absorbance
was expressed as a percentage of control values. For clonogenic studies
this means that the number of colonies surviving a given treatment
were compared to untreated control plates. For the MTT assay, absor
bance levels from drug-treated cells were corrected against untreated
control absorbance values. For the dye exclusion assay, the ratio of
viable tumor cells to duck RBC in treated specimens was compared
with the same ratio in control tubes. The IDM was defined as 50%
reduction in colony number in the clonogenic assay, 50% reduction of
absorbance in the MTT assay, or 50% reduction in the tumor/duck
RBC ratio using the dye exclusion assay.
Standard errors were calculated according to the method of Beving-
ton (26) which takes into account the error for each experimental point

RESULTS
Modification of the MTT Assay to Give Better Solubili/ut ion
of the MTT Formazan Product. The solubility of the MTT-
reduced formazan product was poor in acid isopropyl alcohol
as used in the method of Mosmann (19), while better absorption
characteristics were observed with mineral oil and DMSO as
solvents (Fig. 1). From these experiments we chose 570 nm for
reading the mineral oil solubilized product. DMSO solubiliza-
tion gave an absorption peak (Xmax)at 503 nm. However, Amax
has been shown to vary considerably for MTT formazan, de
pendent on the solvent used, and other factors such as the
concentration of metal ions in the solution (27). With floating

in the Amax,with maximal absorbance detected reproducibly at

tures, with DMSO as the solvent.

duction. The amount of formazan product generated and then
measured after solubilization in mineral oil or DMSO at 570
or 540 nm is proportional to cell number, although absolute
absorbance for a given cell number varies between cell lines
(Fig. 2). These data were generated by plating cells at the
inoculum noted on the :t-axis. Cells were then immediately
incubated with MTT for 4 h, and the plates were then processed.
There was good reproducibility between replicate wells with
standard errors Â«Â±10%.The growth rates of cell lines in
microtiter wells were then determined using the MTT assay
(Fig. 3). Individual wells were analyzed from each cell line, and
cells were counted revealing doubling times of 10 h in V79
cells, 26 h in NCI-H460 cells, and 85 h in NCI-H249 cells.
These results are comparable to doubling times obtained by
standard methods in these cell lines (data not shown). For each
cell line optimal seeding concentrations were derived, to give
where possible maximal absorbance while ensuring that cells
remained in exponential growth. The cell number chosen for
V79 cells was 100 cells/well for a 3-day assay and for NCI-
H460 2,500 and 10,000 cells/well using a 4-day assay. Metab
olism of MTT was poor in NCI-H249 cells, with low absorbance
values. However, because culture conditions such as cell density
can significantly affect the results of clonogenic assays, we chose
to keep seeding cell numbers similar between assays. Therefore,
despite low absorbance values, the 10,000-NCI-H249 cells/well
sample was chosen as the optimal inoculum.

to 5 drugs, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vinblastine, cisplatin,
melphalan, and etoposide, in 2 CHO lines, the wild-type
AuxBl, and its pleiotropic mutant CHRC5. The latter was made
resistant to colchicine and has been shown to exhibit a typical
cross-resistance pattern to many drugs (21). Clonogenic and
MTT assays were carried out simultaneously in these cells and
the results are illustrated in Fig. 4, with IDsoS shown in Table
1. As can be seen in Fig. 4, a high degree of resistance to
Adriamycin and vinblastine is exhibited by the CHRC5 cell line,
with the relative degree of resistance between cell lines similar
using both assays. There is little cross-resistance to cisplatin,
and this is exemplified by both assays. Some cross-resistance
to melphalan is exhibited with quantitatively similar results
obtained with both assays. The clonogenic assay was more
sensitive in all experiments, probably relating to the longer
duration of drug exposure with this assay. The relative degree
of resistance observed for each drug using the clonogenic tech
nique was maintained using the MTT assay.
Comparison of Assays Using Continuous Drug Exposure. The
three cell lines (V79, NCI-H460, and NCI-H249) were used to
compare all three assays following continuous exposure to the
single agents Adriamycin, vinblastine, etoposide, and cisplatin.
Each drug was tested at a minimum of three concentrations,
and the IDsos were determined as shown in Table 2. For
adherent cell lines, excellent correlation was observed for If),,,s
following continuous exposure to cisplatin, Adriamycin, and
etoposide, although nonclonogenic assays appeared more sen
sitive to vinblastine.
With cisplatin good correlation was observed for all cell lines
in the three assays. Nonclonogenic assays gave higher IDM,sfor
Adriamycin and etoposide, using the floating cell line NCI-
H249, but it should be noted that drug exposure time was 18
days for the clonogenic assay and 4 days for nonclonogenic
assays. Dose-response curves were generated for all 4 drugs
using the 3 assays with representative examples illustrated in
Fig. 5, which shows that reasonable correlation is observed
between the MTT and clonogenic assays. The clonogenic assay
appeared to be more sensitive, although allowance should be
made for increased drug exposure time in the clonogenic assays,
particularly those using NCI-H249 cells.

assessment of chemosensitivity following a 1-h drug exposure
to Adriamycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin. The first experiment
was performed in V79 cells and the results are illustrated in
Fig. 6. As can be seen, the assays correlated extremely well for
Adriamycin and cisplatin, although the MTT assay was mark
edly more sensitive to vinblastine. Further studies were then
performed using Adriamycin against the 2 human lung cancer
cell lines, showing good correlation between the clonogenic and
MTT assays, as shown in Fig. 7. Increased sensitivity to vin
blastine in the MTT assay was also seen using NCI-H460 cells
as illustrated in Fig. 7.
Potential Limitations of the MTT Assay. The MTT assay is
a growth assay and, therefore, does not distinguish between
cytostatic and cytocidal effects. The effect of cytostatic agents
on the MTT assay was assessed with the use of isoleucine-
depleted culture medium, which is known to block cells in cell
cycle, causing a d arrest (28, 29). V79 cells were incubated in
isoleucine-free medium for IS h, following which isoleucine
was added and cells were allowed to proliferate for a further 48
h. The MTT assay was then performed and the results were
compared with those for control cells which had been grown in
complete medium throughout. Significant impairment of
growth was observed in isoleucine-depleted cells. In contrast,
15 h of isoleucine depletion did not affect the results of a
clonogenic assay.
The effect of strong reducing agents on the interpretation of
the MTT assay was also studied. Cysteamine (0.1, 1.0, and 10
HIM)was added to individual wells together with MTT. Rapid
reduction of MTT was observed in the solution, although no
crystals were formed. Significant absorption was observed at
540 nm, although following aspiration and resolubilization in
DMSO, no absorption was detectable at this wavelength. When
a similar experiment was performed using V79 cells, cysteamine
reduction did not interfere with the cellular reduction of MTT,
and following resolubilization absorbance values between V79
controls and cysteamine-treated cells were similar.
Many compounds, such as Adriamycin, are known to exhibit
absorption peaks in the 500-600-nm range, although aspiration
of drug-containing medium from the wells resulted in no effect
on absorbance readings. However, these factors can cause prob
lems with floating cell lines, because all the medium is not
removed prior to solubilization of the dye. Alteration of the
oxidation-reduction balance of the cell by preincubation with
agents that deplete intracellular glutathione levels, such as A-
ethylmaleimide, diamide, and buthionine sulfoximine, did not
affect the cellular reduction of MTT.
DISCUSSION
This study confirms, as shown in Fig. 2, that the MTT assay
shows good correlation between spectrophotometric absorbance
and cell number as described previously (19). Using this
method, estimated doubling times for all three cell lines were
quantitatively similar to those obtained using standard tech
niques. However, using the published method for the MTT
assay (19), considerable difficulty was encountered in resol ubi 1-
izing the formazan crystals. An absorbance spectrum of tor
mazan solubili/ed by acid isopropyl alcohol showed a wide
indistinct peak, which is greatly inferior to the absorbance peaks
observed using mineral oil or DMSO as solvents. Greater
solubility and absorbance readings were seen using the latter 2
solvents. Optimal results were achieved by measuring formazan
crystals solubili/ed in mineral oil at a wavelength of 570 nm
and DMSO-solubilized crystals at 540 nm.
It should be stressed that with the MTT assay, optimal
conditions should be elucidated for each cell line, in terms of
both cell number plated and assay duration. It is essential that
sufficient time is allowed for cell death and loss of dehydrogen-
ase activity to occur and that control cells are in exponential
growth at the time the assay is processed. Because the IDâ„¢is

defined as 50% reduction in absorbance compared to control
values, if control cells are allowed to plateau, but treated cells
continue to grow, the ID50 for that drug could be seriously
overestimated. Likewise, with treated cells time should be al
lowed for cell death and loss of dehydrogenase activity; other
wise overestimation of ID50s may occur. Similar conditions
apply to the dye exclusion assay, where optimal seeding con
centrations and assay duration are important factors in obtain
ing satisfactory results.
Using the MTT and dye exclusion assays, good correlation
with the clonogenic assay was achieved in the chemosensitivity
testing of a range of cytotoxic drugs. Differences in relative
chemosensitivity between cell lines were maintained. For con
tinuous drug exposure both nonclonogenic assays exhibited
similar dose-response curves, whereas clonogenic assays ap
peared more sensitive. However, stronger correlation between
assays was observed using 1-h drug exposures, although differ
ences are noted for certain drugs as exemplified by the vinblas
tine data. This drug has cytostatic in addition to cytocidal
properties, and as a result more activity is observed with the
MTT assay. It should be stressed that this assay does not
differentiate between cytostatic and cytocidal effects on cells.
As has been reported previously (20), when medium containing
serum or phenol red is used in this assay, high background
values are observed. However, maximal absorbance for many
human tumor cell lines is approximately 1.0 absorbance unit,
limiting the range of detectability of this assay. Therefore, the
MTT assay is limited to the detection of 1 log of cell kill, as is
confirmed by Fig. 2. Likewise, using the dye exclusion assay,
when significant degrees of cell killing are observed, the number
of viable tumor cells is low, with reading errors correspondingly
high. These results agree with previously published data, claim
ing good correlation between dye exclusion assays and clono
genic assays (14, 15). This particular dye exclusion assay has
the advantage over other short-term assays, in that tumor cells
can be distinguished from nontumorous cells by differential
staining techniques, which is beneficial in the testing of primary
tumor samples. The dye exclusion assay, however, is highly
labor intensive, particularly at the time of reading. The MTT
assay, in contrast, offers an excellent opportunity for the rapid
testing of large numbers of drugs with good reproducibility,
particularly in adherent cell lines, where the standard deviation
of absorbance readings approximates Â±5%.However, the assay
is less optimal for the testing of floating cell lines. Standard
deviations of Â±15%were observed in absorbance readings of
floating cell cultures. The increased variability in absorbance
with floating cultures may be caused by variation in residual
volume following aspiration of medium, prior to solubilization
of the MTT formazan. This problem could be resolved by the
production of a tetrazolium salt, which on reduction forms a
water-soluble formazan dye, allowing microtiter plates to be
read directly.
Agents which alter the oxidation-reduction balance of the
cell by glutathione depletion did not affect the results of the
assay. Likewise, strong reducing agents cause reduction of MTT
in solution but do not affect the interpretation of the assay
when all the supernatant is removed prior to solubilization of
the MTT formazan crystals. For these reasons difficulties re
main in the handling of floating cell cultures using this tech
nique.
In these studies cell lines with vastly different growth char
acteristics were used. Doubling times varied from 10 to 85 h,
and although the majority of cells grew as monolayers, the
small cell lung cancer line grew as floating aggregates. For
chemosensitivity assays utilizing nonclonogenic techniques,
there are many potential factors that may interfere with the
interpretation of any results. Theoretically, for cell lines of
differing growth rates, the relative contributions of in situ cell
death, cell cycle delay, and inhibition of proliferation could be
different and could explain observed differences in chemosen
sitivity seen in the continuous drug exposure experiments.
However, the experiments utilizing 1-h incubation times shows
these factors to be relatively unimportant, with drug exposure
time being the most influential variable. Optimal assay duration
for human lines should be a minimum of 4 days to allow for
cell death and loss of dehydrogenase activity with a maximum
of 7 days to obviate the necessity of refeeding of cultures.
It is obviously appreciated that drug exposure, as measured
by area under the curve calculations, varied between assays
when continuous drug exposure was used. The claim is not
made that similar drug concentrations are effective in the MTT
assay but that similar dose-response curves are observed. Like
wise, differences in sensitivity between cell lines are detectable
and are preserved to a similar degree. Accepting the limitations
described, the semiautomated MTT assay offers a valid, rapid,
and simple method to assess chemosensitivity in cell lines.
However, the value of this assay in the testing of primary tumor
samples may be limited because normal cell contaminants may
also reduce the dye.
