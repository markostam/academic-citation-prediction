ABSTRACT
JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net) is the leading
open-access database of matrix profiles describing
the DNA-binding patterns of transcription factors
(TFs) and other proteins interacting with DNA in a
sequence-specific manner. Its fourth major release
is the largest expansion of the core database to
date: the database now holds 457 non-redundant,
curated profiles. The new entries include the first
batch of profiles derived from ChIP-seq and ChIP-
chip whole-genome binding experiments, and 177
yeast TF binding profiles. The introduction of a
yeast division brings the convenience of JASPAR
to an active research community. As binding
models are refined by newer data, the JASPAR
database now uses versioning of matrices: in this
release, 12% of the older models were updated to
improved versions. Classification of TF families has
been improved by adopting a new DNA-binding
domain nomenclature. A curated catalog of mam-
malian TFs is provided, extending the use of
the JASPAR profiles to additional TFs belonging
to the same structural family. The changes in
the database set the system ready for more rapid
acquisition of new high-throughput data sources.
Additionally, three new special collections provide
matrix profile data produced by recent alternative
high-throughput approaches.
INTRODUCTION
The wide availability of TF aﬃnity data is becoming
essential for an increasing number of research eﬀorts to
understand gene regulation in the post-genomic era.
The increasing amount of assembled genome sequences,
transcriptome data (1), as well as high-throughput studies
revealing genome-wide locations of core promoters (2)
and enhancer elements (3,4) have resulted in the greatest
demand for TF binding site content analyses.
TF binding aﬃnities are typically modeled as position
frequency matrices (PFMs, also known as raw count
matrices or simply binding proﬁles), summarizing
nucleotide counts in an alignment of active binding sites
These can be used to scan genomes for new binding sites
(5). Since the ﬁrst oﬃcial release of JASPAR in 2004 (6),
the research community has embraced it as the leading
open-access database of such matrix proﬁles for TF
binding sites. From the beginning, the aim of its core col-
lection has been to provide a non-redundant set of
curated, high-quality matrix proﬁles derived from experi-
mental binding data in the form of position frequency
matrices (7); in other words, the goal is to present the
best currently available DNA binding model for a given
TF, decided by expert curators.
The availability of potentially useful matrices derived
by other means (e.g. using a number of genome-wide
computational approaches) as well as non-TF binding
proﬁles, prompted the addition of separate JASPAR
Collections in the second release (8): the intention was
to provide those matrix proﬁles in the same format and
hence usable with the same tools as the core JASPAR

database, while keeping the latter reserved for proﬁles
representing experimentally derived data.
While the community has valued the open-access pol-
icy and non-redundant nature of JASPAR, a common
complaint was that the size of the core collection was
small compared to the commercial TransFac database
(9), currently the only comprehensive alternative to
JASPAR. In this update, our goal was to make this gap
smaller by performing a major expansion of the core
database, while maintaining the popular non-redundant,
curated quality. As a result, this fourth major release
introduces a wealth of new and improved matrix proﬁles
and represents the largest expansion of the core database
since its inception, with new data coming either from
high-throughput methods like Chip-seq, or assembled
from TF binding site databases particularly PAZAR (10)
described below.
NEW AND IMPROVED MATRIX PROFILES IN
JASPAR CORE DATABASE
Proﬁles from ChIP-seq
Several recent genome-wide studies have revealed thou-
sands of TF binding sites for individual TFs. Compared
to the original matrices, the larger number of representa-
tive target sequences provides potentially more accurate
proﬁles and brings the added beneﬁt that (unlike in
DNA SELEX), all the binding sites come from the
actual genome sequence to which the TFs in question
are bound in vivo.
To make the derivation of matrices uniform, we
extracted the original sets of bound regions from pub-
lished experiments (11–19). We retrieved 200 bp sequences
centered on each peak and performed de novo motif dis-
covery on them using parallelized MEME (20) on a Cray
XT4 supercomputing platform, which can handle inputs
of many thousands of sequences in manageable time.
In most cases, the resulting matrices closely resemble
those reported in the original publications, produced
using various motif discovery tools. The single exception
was the Zfx proﬁle, where our proﬁle obtained with
MEME from sites reported in (13) diﬀered reproducibly
from the proﬁle reported therein. In this case, we chose to
include the newly derived matrix.
In most cases, the ChIP-seq data resulted in improved
matrices with higher information content than the original
ones derived from either compiled single promoter
assays or from DNA SELEX (Figure 1). This contradicts
the widely held view that SELEX is prone to producing
over-speciﬁed models since many selection rounds are
commonly used. Also, somewhat surprisingly, the
resulting matrices did not diﬀer much as thresholds were
varied for the inclusion of ChIP identiﬁed regions (e.g. top
100 highest conﬁdence bound regions versus top 1000).
Proﬁles from ChIP-chip experiments
The ChIP-chip derived TF binding sites, while not provid-
ing the resolution of the ChIP-seq data, are a rich source
of binding data. Even though they are currently being
superseded by ChIP-seq (21), the published sets contain
a number of high-quality binding data currently
unavailable in the ChIP-seq version. As with ChIP-seq,
we use the enriched regions reported by the authors
of the study in question, and then apply MEME to
ﬁnd the pattern.
Yeast proﬁles in core collection
Previous versions of JASPAR did not include any matrix
proﬁles for yeast TFs. Responding to community requests,
we have compiled results from several large-scale binding
proﬁle projects to produce a non-redundant set of matrix
proﬁles for TFs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The
sources used, in order of preference, were a recent
in vitro binding screen (22), a protein-binding microarray
(PBM) experiment (23), the compiled SCPD binding
proﬁle database (24), the SwissRegulon computational
re-analysis of multiple data collections (25) and a motif
discovery-based collection from a widely used ChIP-
chip data collection (26). The prioritization of the
contributions, as well as the indicated deviations, reﬂect
the curators’ personal perspective. The preferred set, from
Badis et al. (22), appeared to oﬀer matrices of consistently
high-quality, likely reﬂecting the curated nature of
the eﬀort (new experimental data were compared against
existing data for consistency). All matrices were manually
curated to remove redundancies and converted to count
matrices. In curating the collection, the curators identiﬁed
a few instances in which proﬁles were preferred in contra-
diction with the source priority: GAL4 (SwissRegulon),
GCR1 (SwissRegulon), MATALPHA2 (SCPD), PHO4
(UniProbe with the six leftmost and rightmost
nucleotides trimmed) and ROX1 (SCPD). The resulting
non-redundant set represents a comprehensive open-
access compilation of yeast binding proﬁles, facilitating
genome-wide computational studies of yeast regulatory
inputs. We are grateful to the commitment of all of the
data providers to open information, without which the
compilation would have been impossible.
New literature-based proﬁles from PAZAR
Recently, annotations of hundreds of experimentally
validated TF binding sites from published studies have
accumulated in the PAZAR database (27), allowing us
to produce additional matrices similar in nature to the
original JASPAR release (DNA SELEX or compiled
from multiple studies on individual binding sites). The
PAZAR database was mined to identify TFs with more
than 15 annotated binding sites. The resulting data was
manually curated, selecting only the results from the most
high-quality data collections (i.e. collections manually
annotated from the literature by specialists) and discard-
ing any redundant sequences to build the proﬁles. The
resulting set of compiled binding sites for each TF was
used as input to the MEME software to obtain a proﬁle.
If non-informative positions were obtained on the edges of
the matrices, the proﬁles were trimmed accordingly.
Additional model organism core proﬁles
For this new release, two major sources of Drosophila
melanogaster matrix proﬁles have been used: DNaseI

footprinting data by Bergman et al. (28) and bacterial one-
hybrid data by Wolfe and colleagues (29–31). The proﬁles
from these data sets have been curated by the authors
to remove redundancies among the results and with the
existing proﬁles in the previous version of JASPAR
database. In addition, any proﬁle based on less than 10
sequences has been discarded. This new insect sub-section
of JASPAR core includes 123 curated proﬁles; however,
these are heavily dominated by the homeodomain proﬁles
(29). For Caenorhabditis elegans, no large sources of data
are currently available. Through literature searches, we
identiﬁed only ﬁve proﬁles suitable for inclusion in the
core database (32–36).
In summary, the JASPAR core database now numbers
457 non-redundant matrix proﬁles (Table 1). New core
proﬁles are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
NEW COLLECTIONS
In addition to the expansion of the core database, we
remain committed to providing other collections of
matrix proﬁles within JASPAR.
Recently, the PBM technology has emerged as a new
in vitro method for the characterization of TF binding
aﬃnities (37). The UniPROBE database hosts the PBM
datasets and makes the derived matrix proﬁles available
to the community (38). We have selected three of these
new datasets as new collections in JASPAR:
. PBM, the set derived by (39) from binding preferences
of 104 mouse TFs. For each TF, both the primary and
secondary motifs identiﬁed in the study were
incorporated.
. PBM_HOMEO, the set derived by (40) includes 176
proﬁles from mouse homeodomains. From the original
168 TFs analyzed, two were discarded because they
could not be identiﬁed (Dobox4 and Dobox5) and
ten have two alternative proﬁles.
. PBM_HLH, the set derived from binding preferences
of dimers of C. elegans bHLH TFs, including nine
homodimers and ten heterodimers (41).
With these additions, JASPAR now holds 840 proﬁles
within collections outside of the core database.
GENERAL ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES
Version control and taxonomic catagories
In line with our goal of presenting the best currently avail-
able binding model for any TF, we updated some previous
JASPAR entries motivated by new available data.
Seventeen entries of the previous release were updated.
The replacement of existing matrices with the new ones
led us to the introduction of version numbers in matrix
IDs, in a manner equivalent to the management of
sequence versions in GenBank. For example, the old
GATA1 proﬁle MA0035 is replaced with a new one, and
the full identiﬁer of the new matrix is MA0035.2, while the
old one becomes MA0035.1. By default, the latest version
of non-redundant database includes the latest version of
each proﬁle. A search for ‘MA0035’ also retrieves the
newest version, with an option to view older versions.
Older versions can also be downloaded from the
JASPAR web site.
The addition of 177 yeast matrices to the core collection
means that the JASPAR matrices now span the entire
eukaryote crown group. Even before that, a typical
user scenario included the selection of only a subset of
matrices derived from a particular taxonomic category
Figure 1. Examples of SELEX-derived matrix proﬁles replaced by ChIP-seq-derived proﬁles. (A) The previous MYCN matrix proﬁle (MA0104.1)
derived by DNA SELEX. (B) The new MYCN proﬁle (MA0104.2) derived from ChIP-seq binding shows general agreement with the SELEX proﬁle,
with additional information derived from hundreds of sites at ﬂanking positions. (C) The previous KLF4 proﬁle (MA0039.1) is an example of
SELEX-derived proﬁle that did not correspond well to the handful of individually characterized KLF4 sites. (D) The new KLF proﬁle derived from
ChIP-seq data (13) shows a dramatic increase in information content and a good agreement with individually characterized binding sites.

of organisms, across which the TFs are strictly
orthologous and their binding activities largely unchanged
(e.g. vertebrates). For that reason, both the JASPAR web
interface and the download section now present the
database content split into major taxonomic categories—
vertebrates, insects, nematodes, (higher) plants and
fungi—within which most of the binding sites are trans-
ferable across species. The option to search with and
download the entire core collection is still available and
behaves as before.
A standardized TF classiﬁcation
Up to now, JASPAR used an ad hoc structural class
annotation for the TFs associated with each matrix
proﬁle. In this release, we have updated the structural
class annotation using our recently published catalog
for mouse and human TFs (42) in which DNA
binding proteins are associated with a structural classi-
ﬁcation system. We adopted the two-level classiﬁcation
described by Luscombe et al. (43) and extended it to
accommodate additional binding domain structures.
For the TFs from other species, we extrapolated the
structural class and family based on the PFAM anno-
tation of the DNA-binding domains. This addition to
JASPAR provides a standardized system for the classi-
ﬁcation of TFs and allows a better grouping into
families (or sub-families) with potentially similar
binding preferences. A curated list of putative mouse/
human DNA-binding proteins is provided at the
JASPAR web site. It is also possible to browse the
catalog by structure, to see what proﬁles that are avail-
able within the web interface.
Changes in the underlying database structure
and interface
The underlying database schema was updated to accom-
modate matrix versions and to allow multiple species and
TF accession numbers, as well to allow the storage of
multiple collections in the same sql database. A Perl API
(JASPAR5) for the new schema is available as part of the
open-source TFBS Perl framework (44).
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
In the forthcoming months and years, a large amount of
whole-genome binding data from ChIP-seq and related
techniques will become available. We have created the
ﬁrst steps towards a standardized way of including this
new data into JASPAR, which is expected to expand
signiﬁcantly with the concomitant increase in the quality
of matrix data. At the same time, JASPAR collections
outside the core will continue to include interesting
matrix sets derived by other means.
