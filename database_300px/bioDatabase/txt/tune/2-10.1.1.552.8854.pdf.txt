ABSTRACT
Bacterial and mammalian AlkB proteins are iron(II)-
and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that
reverse methylation damage, such as 1-methylade-
nine and 3-methylcytosine, in RNA and DNA. An
AlkB-domain is encoded by the genome of numer-
ous single-stranded, plant-infecting RNA viruses,
the majority of which belong to the Flexiviridae
family. Our phylogenetic analysis of AlkB sequences
suggests that a single plant virus might have
acquired AlkB relatively recently, followed by hori-
zontal dissemination among other viruses via
recombination. Here, we describe the first func-
tional characterization of AlkB proteins from three
plant viruses. The viral AlkB proteins efficiently
reactivated methylated bacteriophage genomes
when expressed in Escherichia coli, and also
displayed robust, iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-
dependent demethylase activity in vitro. Viral AlkB
proteins preferred RNA over DNA substrates, and
thus represent the first AlkBs with such substrate
specificity. Our results suggest a role for viral
AlkBs in maintaining the integrity of the viral RNA
genome through repair of deleterious methylation
damage, and support the notion that AlkB-mediated
RNA repair is biologically relevant.
INTRODUCTION
Alkylating agents are found both in the environment and
inside cells and can cause alkylation of the majority of
N- and O-atoms in DNA and RNA bases (1). Some of
these alkylations interfere with Watson-Crick base
pairing, thereby blocking replication and transcription of
DNA, as well as mRNA translation. Alkylations may also
cause mispairing between bases, leading to mutations.
Thus, alkylation damage poses a serious threat to the
transmission and integrity of the genetic information
stored in DNA and RNA, and all organisms are equipped
with various repair systems to counteract the deleterious
eﬀects of alkylation damage (2).
The AlkB protein from Escherichia coli (EcAlkB) is
expressed as part of an adaptive response when bacteria
are exposed to alkylating agents, and repairs base lesions
resulting from the methylation of an equivalent position in
purines (N1) and pyrimidines (N3), i.e. 1-methyladenine
(1-meA) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC), as well as the less
abundant 1-methylguanine and 3-methylthymine (3–5).
Since these positions are involved in Watson–Crick base
pairing, and therefore shielded within the structure of
double-stranded (ds) nucleic acids, the corresponding
lesions are preferentially introduced into single-stranded
(ss) regions. EcAlkB belongs to the iron(II)- and 2-oxo-
glutarate-dependent [Fe(II)/2OG-dependent] dioxygenase
superfamily (6), which comprises enzymes that require
2OG as cosubstrate and ferrous iron as a cofactor.
EcAlkB utilizes molecular oxygen to oxidize its methy-
lated substrate and the resulting unstable hydroxymethyl
group is spontaneously released as formaldehyde (7,8). It
has also been shown that bulkier lesions, such as ethyl and
propyl groups, as well as exocyclic etheno and ethano
groups, can be repaired by AlkB proteins, but usually
with lower eﬃciencies than for methylated bases (9–12).
AlkB homologues (ABHs) are found in all multicellular
organisms, as well as in many bacteria and fungi, and
mammalian genomes encode eight diﬀerent ABHs (13).
Two of these, ABH2 and ABH3 (hABH2/hABH3 in
humans; mABH2/mABH3 in mice), have been character-
ized biochemically, and were shown to have a repair

activity similar to that of EcAlkB (9,14–16). Interestingly,
ABH3 and EcAlkB can also remove lesions from RNA
substrates, leading to functional recovery of damaged
RNA (14,17). This suggests a possible role for AlkB-
mediated demethylation in RNA repair, but the biological
relevance is yet uncertain.
Conspicuously, an AlkB domain is present in the repli-
case polyprotein of a number of plant viruses, most of
them belonging to the family Flexiviridae (6,18). The pre-
sence of an AlkB domain is remarkable, considering the
limited coding capacity of these positive-stranded RNA
viruses with genome sizes as small as 7 kb. In this study,
we have performed a functional characterization of AlkB
proteins from Grapevine virus A (GVA) (19), Blueberry
scorch virus (BlScV) (20) and Blackberry virus Y (BVY)
(21), representing diverse genera of Flexiviridae, and a yet
unnamed new genus in the Potyviridae family, respec-
tively. These proteins were all shown to remove methyl
lesions from RNA and DNA, but with substantially
higher activity on RNA substrates. The results support a
role for viral AlkBs in maintaining the integrity of the
viral RNA genome through removal of deleterious RNA
damage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein sequence analysis
The set of viral, bacterial and eukaryotic AlkB proteins
for phylogenetic analysis was identiﬁed using PSI-BLAST
searches (22) against the nonredundant database of pro-
tein sequences (NCBI, NIH). Multiple alignments were
constructed using the MUSCLE program (23).
Maximum likelihood trees were generated using the
ProtML program of the MOLPHY package (24) by opti-
mizing the least-squares tree with local rearrangements
[Jones–Taylor–Thornton evolutionary model (25) with
adjustment for observed amino acid frequencies].
Reliability of the internal tree branches were estimated
with the RELL bootstrap method (10 000 replications)
using the ProtML program (26).
Plasmid construction
For phage reactivation assays, viral AlkB-coding
sequences were ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) on full-length or partial cDNAs derived from
viral genomes, using primers containing NdeI (fwd) and
BamHI (rev) restriction sites, and subsequently cloned
into the same sites in the low-copy-number, toluic
acid inducible vector pJB658 (27). For puriﬁcation of
N-terminally 6xHis-tagged recombinant protein expressed
in E. coli, NdeI-BamHI fragments were subcloned from
the pJB658-derived expression construct into the corre-
sponding sites in pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI,
USA). For the expression of C-terminally 6xHis-tagged
GVA-36, the GVA-36 coding sequence was obtained by
PCR and the resulting fragment was inserted between the
SacI and SalI sites in pET28a. The corresponding expres-
sion plasmids for EcAlkB, pJB658-AlkB and pET28-
AlkB, have been described previously (14).
Protein purification
EcAlkB was expressed and puriﬁed as previously
described (14). C-terminally (GVA-36) or N-terminally
(all others) 6xHis-tagged viral AlkB proteins were
expressed from the corresponding pET28a-derived con-
structs in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Expression was per-
formed overnight at 168C in 1 l of LB medium containing
0.075mM IPTG. Bacterial extracts were obtained by
French press treatment, and proteins were subsequently
puriﬁed from the extracts using TALON Metal Aﬃnity
Resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturers instructions. Protein purity and yield
was assessed by 15% SDS–PAGE followed by coomassie
brilliant blue-staining of the gel.
Phage reactivation assay
DNA bacteriophage M13mp18 and RNA bacteriophage
MS2 were methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) treated to
examine reactivation of methylated ss phage DNA and
RNA, respectively, essentially as previously described
(14). MMS-inactivated bacteriophages were mixed with
E. coli alkB mutant cells (strain HK82/F0), expressing
EcAlkB or viral AlkB from the pJB658 vector in the pre-
sence of 2mM toluic acid. This mixture in soft agar
medium was layered on top of an agar plate that was
subsequently placed overnight at 378C. Phage survival
was scored by counting plaques.
Assay for AlkB-mediated decarboxylation of
2-oxoglutarate
The assay was performed essentially as described before
(4), using the method developed by Kaule and Gu¨nzler
(28). Reactions were performed for 30min at 378C in a
50 ml reaction mixture containing 50mM HEPES–KOH
pH 7.5, 4mM ascorbic acid, 16 mM [5-14C]2-oxoglutarate
(Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA, USA), 144mM unla-
belled 2-oxoglutarate and 100 pmol of EcAlkB or
500 pmol of viral AlkB. After incubation, remaining
[5-14C]2-oxoglutarate was precipitated with 2,4-dinitro-
phenylhydrazine, and [1-14C]succinate in the supernatant
was measured by scintillation counting. When indicated,
400 mM 1-methyladenosine was present in the reaction
mixture. Fe2+ (80mM FeSO4) was present as indicated,
while 1mM EDTA was added when Fe2+ was omitted.
Assay for oxidative demethylation of [3H]methylated
DNA and RNA oligonucleotides
The preparation of [3H]methylated oligonucleotides
(ssDNA: TAAAATAATAAATTAAA, ssRNA: CAUG
AUAACCGCGACUACACUGAC, polyA and polyC)
using N-[3H]methyl-N-nitrosourea was performed as
described previously (15). [3H]methylated dsRNA sub-
strates were generated by annealing a non-methylated
complementary strand as described (15). [3H]methylated
ss and ds substrates (typically 1000 d.p.m.) were incubated
with AlkB proteins for 30min at 378C in a 50ml reaction
mixture containing 50mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 2mM
ascorbic acid, 100 mM 2-oxoglutarate, 50 mg/ml

RESULTS
Phylogenetic analysis of viral AlkB proteins
In an attempt to gain insight into the origin and evolution
of the AlkB homologues encoded in genomes of plant
viruses, a two-tier phylogenetic analysis of the AlkB
family was performed. First, a large alignment was con-
structed that included representative sets of AlkB proteins
from bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses (Figure S1), and a
phylogenetic tree was built, aiming at deciphering the ulti-
mate origin of the viral AlkBs. In the resulting tree,
the viral sequences formed one of the three major, well-
separated branches that is strongly supported by boot-
strap analysis, whereas the remaining two branches both
included assortments of bacterial and eukaryotic members
of the family (Figures 1A and S2). Because no indepen-
dent information was available to root this tree, the origin
of viral AlkBs could formally not be inferred. However,
viral AlkBs were signiﬁcantly more similar to bacterial
homologues than to eukaryotic ones. This was also
reﬂected by the fact that the ﬁrst iteration of BLASTp
searches with viral AlkB sequences yielded statistically
signiﬁcant hits (E-values in the range of 105 to 104) to
many bacterial AlkBs, especially those from cyanobac-
teria, but not to eukaryotic AlkBs. Notably, the viral
AlkB clade in the family tree is well separated from the
plant homologues (Figure 1A).
Next, a more complete alignment of viral AlkBs was
generated using proteobacteria as the outgroup to exam-
ine the evolutionary relationships of these proteins among
AlkB-containing plant viruses (Figure S3). The resulting
topology of the phylogenetic tree is compatible with con-
siderable intervirus horizontal transfer of AlkB-coding
sequences (Figure 1B). The single potyvirus sequence

clusters with a distinct subset of ﬂexiviruses in a strongly
supported branch. The closterovirus sequences clearly do
not form a clade and are instead scattered among the
ﬂexiviruses. However, there is a well-supported clade
that unites a ﬂexivirus (ICRV), a closterovirus (LChV-2)
and a sadwavirus (BRNV) of the order Picornavirales, so
far the only AlkB-carrying virus with an icosahedral
capsid.
Notably, several viruses encode inactivated forms of
AlkB as indicated by the replacement of one or more
conserved amino acid residues implicated in enzymatic
activity (Figure S3). In the phylogenetic tree, the inacti-
vated AlkBs typically comprised long branches that were
scattered among the active enzymes (Figure 1B).
Bioinformatics prediction of a repair function for
viral AlkBs
As discussed in the previous paragraph, viral AlkBs dis-
play a high degree of similarity to bacterial AlkB proteins,
particularly those belonging to group 1B (29), as well as to
ABH2 and ABH3, which represent vertebrate AlkB pro-
teins already reported to be involved in nucleic acid
repair (9,14). Interestingly, the viral, vertebrate and bac-
terial AlkBs shared several conserved amino acid residues
in a region corresponding to the EcAlkB nucleotide
recognition lid (Figure 2). Two of these residues, Trp69
and Tyr76, were found to be in close contact with the
1-meA substrate in the EcAlkB 3D-structure (30).

that the viral AlkB proteins were likely to possess a repair
activity similar to that previously reported for EcAlkB,
ABH2 and ABH3, and experiments were designed to
further explore this possibility.
Repair of methylation damage in bacteriophage genomes
AlkB proteins from ﬁve plant viruses, i.e. GVA, BlScV,
BVY, Citrus leaf blotch virus (CLBV) and Little cherry
virus 2 (LChV-2) were selected for initial functional char-
acterization. These viruses represent three divergent
families, Flexiviridae (GVA, BlScV and CLBV),
Closteroviridae (LChV-2) and Potyviridae (BVY). The
viral AlkB domain is part of a large replicase polyprotein,
where it is ﬂanked by long stretches of low sequence con-
servation. It is therefore not trivial to deﬁne the N- and
C-terminal borders of the functionally active viral AlkB
proteins. However, based on sequence homology within
the viral AlkB family, as well as sequence comparison
with bacterial AlkBs, a viral AlkB core region could be
deﬁned (Figure 3). This core region of 132 aa is substan-
tially smaller than a typical AlkB protein from bacteria
(190–220 aa), suggesting that parts of the less-conserved
regions ﬂanking the viral AlkB core may be required to
form a functional AlkB protein. Indeed, some sequence
conservation within the viral AlkB group, not shared
with other AlkB proteins, is observed in a region of
20–25 aa upstream of the viral AlkB core (Figure 3).
Based on this observation, viral AlkB proteins with
N-terminal extensions of diﬀerent length were constructed
(Figure 3). The border of these extensions was chosen
rather arbitrarily, but without disrupting predicted sec-
ondary structure elements. This resulted in viral
AlkB proteins with N-terminal extensions of 0, 36, 50 or
94 aa, designated accordingly (GVA-36, BlScV-94, etc.).
The C-terminal border of the viral AlkB proteins was set
at 6 aa downstream of the characteristic RX5R motif
(Figures 3, S1 and S3), which is found close to the
C-terminus of most AlkB proteins, and is usually followed
by 5–20 non-conserved residues.
An AlkB protein active on RNA (e.g. EcAlkB or
hABH3) is, when expressed in AlkB-deﬁcient E. coli,
able to increase the survival of RNA bacteriophage MS2
inactivated by treatment with a methylating compound
(e.g. MMS), due to repair of deleterious methyl lesions
in the viral RNA (14). In initial experiments, AlkB pro-
teins derived from the ﬁve selected viruses were tested for
such repair activity. Robust repair activity, comparable to
that of EcAlkB, was observed for GVA-36, BVY-36 and
BlScV-94, while only low activity was detected in the case
of LChV-2-50 and CLBV-36 (Figure 4A). Based on these
results, the viral AlkB proteins from GVA, BVY and
BlScV were selected for further analysis.
Our initial experiments demonstrated repair activity for
viral AlkBs containing N-terminal extensions beyond the
AlkB core. To address whether these extensions are
required for AlkB activity, each of the three selected
viral AlkBs was provided with N-terminal extension of
0, 36 or 94 aa (Figure 3). The activity of the resulting
proteins was again assessed by measuring their ability to
reactivate methylated MS2 when expressed in E. coli. The
results showed that the three shortest proteins were inac-
tive (BVY-0 and BlScV-0) or showed low activity
(GVA-0), whereas the longer forms displayed moderate
to high activity (Figure 4B–D). GVA-36, BVY-36, BVY-
94 and BlScV-94 were as active as EcAlkB, while the activ-
ity of GVA-94 and BlScV-36 was somewhat lower. In
conclusion, sequences N-terminal to the AlkB core
appeared to be required for viral AlkB activity.

The results presented above strongly suggest that viral
AlkBs represent nucleic acid repair proteins. Since viral
AlkBs originate from RNA viruses, RNA repair is the
most obvious candidate function for these proteins.
However, all AlkB proteins studied to date are at least
as active on DNA as on RNA substrates (14,15). To
assess the ability of the viral AlkBs to repair damaged
DNA, an experiment identical to the phage reactivation
experiment described above was performed, except that
the RNA phage MS2 was replaced by the ssDNA phage
M13. For this experiment, three proteins that displayed
high activity on methylated RNA were selected, i.e.
GVA-36, BVY-36 and BlScV-94. The expression of these
proteins in E. coli increased the survival of methylated
DNA phage to a similar extent, indicating that they also
can repair DNA (Figure 4E). However, while expression
of EcAlkB increased the survival of DNA phage M13
exposed to 40mM MMS by 6–7 orders of magnitude,
the observed increase was only 3–4 orders of magnitude
for the viral AlkB proteins. Combined with the observa-
tion that these proteins were as eﬀective as EcAlkB in
reactivating methylated RNA phage (Figure 4A–D),
these results may suggest that DNA is not the preferred
substrate for the viral AlkB proteins.
All AlkB proteins contain a His-X-Asp-Xn-His motif,
which is involved in iron(II) binding, and represents a
hallmark of Fe(II)/2OG-dependent dioxygenases (30,31).
It was shown for hABH3 that mutating either the ﬁrst
histidine or the aspartic acid residue completely abolished
enzymatic activity (32). To test whether corresponding
mutations in viral AlkB would aﬀect activity, amino
acid substitutions His59Ala and Asp61Ala were intro-
duced in BVY-94 (amino acid numbering refers to the
AlkB core; Figure 3). As expected, both mutants, BVY-
94-H59A and BVY-94-D61A, were unable to rescue
methylated RNA phage MS2, supporting that
His59 and Asp61 are important residues for catalysis
(Figure 4F).
In vitro characterization of recombinant viral AlkB proteins
Many Fe(II)/2OG-dependent dioxygenases are able to cat-
alyse the decarboxylation of the cosubstrate 2-oxogluta-
rate to succinate at a low rate even in the absence of their
primary substrate (‘uncoupled reaction’), and this is also
the case for EcAlkB (7,8). To conﬁrm that viral AlkBs
represent 2OG-dependent enzymes, recombinant GVA-
36, BVY-94 and BlScV-94, were expressed in E. coli and
puriﬁed as hexahistidine-tagged proteins (Figure 5A),
and then tested for their ability to carry out the conversion
of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate. All three proteins
showed robust decarboxylation activity in the absence of
any substrate, and the reaction could be stimulated by the
substrate-mimic 1-methyladenosine (Figure 5B), which was

previously shown to stimulate this reaction in the case of
EcAlkB (33). Omitting Fe2+ from the reaction buﬀer
reduced decarboxylation activity drastically (Figure 5B).
The mutants BVY-94-H59A and BVY-94-D61A were
both unable to convert 2-oxoglutarate to succinate
(Figure 5B). Taken together, these results conﬁrmed that
the viral AlkBs are iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
repair enzymes, and indicated that these proteins are able
to accommodate 1-meA in their active site.
When ss nucleic acids are treated with methylating
agents such as MMS or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea
(MNU), substantial amounts of the AlkB substrates
1-meA and, to a lesser extent, 3-meC are introduced (1).
To investigate the in vitro repair activity and the substrate
speciﬁcity of viral AlkB, recombinant GVA-36, BVY-94
and BlScV-94 were incubated with RNA or DNA oligo-
nucleotides that had been [3H]methylated through treat-
ment with [3H]MNU. When comparing the activity on
ssRNA relative to ssDNA, EcAlkB was approximately
10-fold more active on ssDNA (Figure 6A), conﬁrming
previous observations (14). In contrast, the activity of
the viral AlkB proteins was generally higher (up to
10-fold) on ssRNA than on ssDNA (Figure 6A).
Next, it was tested whether the viral AlkBs were
also active on a dsRNA substrate, which was generated
by annealing an unlabelled complementary RNA

agreement with previous observations (15), EcAlkB dis-
played a somewhat lower activity on dsRNA substrates
than on ssRNA substrates (Figure 6A). This was also the
case for GVA-36 and BVY-94, while BlScV-94 was
equally active on both substrates.
Treatment of nucleic acids with methylating agents gen-
erates a variety of methyl adducts. To study whether the
viral AlkB proteins are able to speciﬁcally repair 1-meA
and 3-meC, their demethylating activity was tested on the
homopolymeric [3H]methylated substrates polyA and
polyC, respectively. As previously found (14), EcAlkB
was able to eﬃciently demethylate both substrates
(Figure 6A). However, the viral AlkB proteins displayed
a substantially lower activity on polyC than on polyA,
suggesting that 1-meA rather than 3-meC is the preferred
substrate for these enzymes. As expected, omitting the
cofactor Fe2+ and/or the cosubstrate 2OG from the reac-
tion, or introducing the inactivating mutations His59Ala
or Asp61Ala drastically reduced the demethylase activity
of BVY-94 on polyA (Figure 6B).
In summary, the data from our enzymatic assays indi-
cate, as already suggested by the phage reactivation
experiments (Figure 4), that the viral AlkB proteins are
repair enzymes capable of reversing 1-meA, and somewhat
less eﬃciently, 3-meC lesions in nucleic acids, with an
appreciable preference for RNA over DNA.
DISCUSSION
This report describes the ﬁrst functional characterization
of AlkB proteins from plant viruses. A sequence compar-
ison with other AlkB proteins suggested that the viral
AlkB proteins are involved in repairing methylation
damage, and this indeed turned out to be the case. The
three proteins studied in detail represent two diverse viral
superfamilies, Alphavirus- and Picornavirus-like (34), and
they had very similar properties, indicating that they per-
form the same biological function in planta. They all dis-
played a repair activity similar to EcAlkB, but preferred
RNA over DNA, and are the ﬁrst AlkB proteins with such
substrate speciﬁcity. Moreover, the viral AlkB proteins
displayed robust demethylation activity both on ssRNA
and dsRNA, presumably enabling them to repair alkyla-
tion damage both in the ssRNA viral genome and in the
dsRNA replication intermediates generated in the host cell
during infection. Thus, viral AlkB represents the ﬁrst
example of virally encoded alkylation repair proteins.
It has been demonstrated that AlkB-mediated repair
can functionally reactivate methylated tRNA and
mRNA, indicating that RNA repair may be biologically
relevant (17). This notion was further supported by the
observation that while mice lacking mABH2 displayed
defective repair of 1-meA lesions in DNA, no such
defect was observed in mice lacking the putative RNA
repair enzyme mABH3 (35). However, since the AlkB
proteins reported to repair RNA are equally (ABH3) or
more (EcAlkB) active on DNA, it has been diﬃcult to rule
out the possibility that AlkB-mediated RNA demethyla-
tion is an irrelevant side activity. On the other hand, since
the AlkB-containing viruses have a positive-strand RNA
genome, replicate in cytosolic membrane-bound compart-
ments (36), and the AlkB domain in many cases remains
part of an unprocessed (cytosolic) replicase polyprotein, it
is very diﬃcult to imagine a DNA repair function for viral
AlkB. Thus, the current ﬁnding that viral AlkB proteins
are able to eﬃciently repair methyl lesions in RNA, and
even prefer RNA over DNA, provides a very strong

argument for the biological signiﬁcance of AlkB-mediated
RNA repair.
Only a few examples of viral RNA repair have so far
been demonstrated. The 3’-end of viral RNAs is vulner-
able to degradation by host RNases, and several mecha-
nisms can mend the resulting truncated ends (37,38). Also,
when bacteria are infected with bacteriophage T4, a host
response is mounted involving the cleavage of the Lys-
speciﬁc tRNA in the anticodon loop, thereby preventing
the synthesis of proteins required for the phage infection
to proceed. The T4 RNA ligase counteracts this response
by repairing the cleaved tRNA (39,40). Furthermore,
mechanisms for removing aberrant bases from viral
DNA genomes have been reported. Some DNA viruses
encode photolyases or glycosylases to remove UV-induced
pyrimidine dimers from the genome (41,42), whereas others
carry uracil-DNA glycosylases to remove uracils resulting
from cytosine deamination or uracil misincorporation (43).
Several of these DNA repair mechanisms depend on
an undamaged template strand (present in dsDNA).
The AlkB-mechanism, on the other hand, is template-
independent, making it well suited for RNA repair.
In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are media-
tors of a host RNA interference (RNAi) response causing
degradation of viral RNAs. It was originally suggested
that the role of viral AlkB may be to counteract a host
response involving RNA methylation (6). Interestingly, it
was subsequently shown that siRNAs are methylated at
the 20-OH of the 30-terminal nucleotide by the methylase
HEN1 (44). Several virus-encoded suppressors of silencing
have been shown to interfere with HEN1-mediated
methylation (45). Since the viral AlkBs displayed robust
activity on 1-meA and contain key conserved residues
involved in the coordination of this substrate, we ﬁnd it
less likely that the 20-O-methylated ribose of siRNAs is a
substrate for viral AlkB. In agreement with this, we were
unable to detect RNAi suppression activity of viral AlkBs
using conventional transient in planta assays or stable
transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana by viral AlkBs
(Peremyslov,V.V. and Dolja,V.V., unpublished data).
However, although our presented results clearly indicate
a role for viral AlkB in RNA repair, one cannot comple-
tely rule out the possibility that they are involved in coun-
teracting a yet undiscovered host antiviral defence system,
involving the introduction of AlkB substrates into host or
viral RNA.
Alkylating agents are found both in the environment
and intracellularly, and it is believed that both these
sources can contribute signiﬁcantly to the cellular load
of alkylation damage. It has been suggested that plant
viruses may have acquired AlkB recently in response to
the use of methylating agents, e.g. methylbromide, as pes-
ticides (46). We consider this unlikely, because many
AlkB-containing viruses infect plant species not treated
with such agents, and because the time elapsed since the
relatively recent introduction of such pesticides is prob-
ably too short for the observed spread and phylogenetic
divergence of viral AlkBs from their cellular ancestors.
Viruses that have AlkB often infect woody or perennial
plants, where they may survive for years in a hostile envir-
onment within the phloem sieve elements to ensure their
eventual transmission to new plants. We favour the
hypothesis that the viral genome may occasionally be sub-
jected to considerable methylation damage in this environ-
ment, and that viral AlkBs substantially enhance virus
propagation by repairing such damage upon virus entry
into the host cell.
Viral AlkBs represent a remarkable example of viral
proteins with readily identiﬁable homologues in cellular
genomes. Based on the observation that viral AlkB pro-
teins are more similar to AlkB homologues from bacteria
than from plants, it appears most likely that the ﬁrst viral
AlkB was derived via horizontal gene transfer from a bac-
terial source, possibly, from a bacterial pathogen or sym-
biont of plants. The lack of clustering between viral AlkBs
and any speciﬁc bacterial branch (Figure 1A) could be
explained by the well-known fast evolution of viral
RNA sequences and/or by the absence of close relatives
of the actual source bacterium in the current databases.
With the exception of Flexiviridae, AlkB-containing
viruses represent a minor proportion of viruses within
their corresponding taxa, with BVY being the only
known AlkB-containing member of the vast family
Potyviridae. This distribution pattern suggests that AlkB
was acquired relatively recently, likely by a virus within
the family Flexiviridae where AlkB-containing viruses are
more common than in other viral families, and then dis-
seminated horizontally, via recombination between viruses
including very distantly related ones such as BRNV. The
spread of AlkB proteins to new viruses might have
occurred through gene transfer between ﬂexiviruses and
viruses from other plant RNA virus families, which fre-
quently occurs in mixed infections of the same, often
woody or perennial host. Also, given the rapid evolution
of RNA viruses, the very existence of a compact viral clade
in the AlkB family tree (Figure 1A) is best compatible with
a horizontal mode of their spread among viruses.
It is an intriguing question why only a subset of the
plant viruses within a given family possesses an AlkB
homologue. Possibly, having an AlkB protein gives the
virus a selective advantage under conditions of high
methylation load, and viruses that do not experience
such conditions may have disposed of, or never acquired
AlkBs. The notion that viral AlkB proteins may be dis-
posed of when no longer needed, e.g. when a virus evolves
to infect a diﬀerent host, is supported by the observation
that a handful of plant viruses have AlkB domains where
several of the residues thought to be important for enzy-
matic activity are mutated. The scattered presence of inac-
tivated AlkBs among active ones in the phylogenetic tree is
best compatible withmultiple, independent inactivations of
AlkB that potentially might have been linked to a switch to
environments with lower alkylation pressure. Interestingly,
three of the viruses that apparently have inactivated AlkBs,
infect potato; a non-woody and non-perennial plant, where
the evolutionary pressure for maintaining the AlkB func-
tion might be absent (Figures 1B and S3).
To further understand the role of AlkB in viral infec-
tion, it will be of interest to study the infectivity in planta
of viruses in which the AlkB region has been inactivated
by mutation, as well as to study the possible accumulation
