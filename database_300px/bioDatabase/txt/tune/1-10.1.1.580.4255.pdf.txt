Abstract This review will focus on the role of cytokines in
the behavior of macrophages, a prominent cell type of ath-
erosclerotic lesions. Once these macrophages have immi-
grated into the vessel wall, they propagate the development
of atherosclerosis by modifying lipoproteins, accumulating
intracellular lipids, remodeling the extracellular environ-
ment, and promoting local coagulation. The numerous cyto-
kines that have been detected in atherosclerosis, combined
with the expression of large numbers of cytokine receptors
on macrophages, are consistent with this axis being an
important contributor to lesion development. Given the vast
literature on cytokine-macrophage interactions, this review
will be selective, with an emphasis on the major cytokines
that have been detected in atherosclerotic lesions and their
effects on properties that are relevant to lesion formation
and maturation. There will be an emphasis on the role of cy-
tokines in regulating lipid metabolism by macrophages.
We will provide an overview of the major findings in cell
culture and then put these in the context of in vivo stud-
ies.

As noted in Getz’s overview (1), lesions contain large
numbers of cytokines that can be derived from several cell
types. These cytokines may affect the function of many
cell types in atherogenesis. The effects of cytokines on en-
dothelial and smooth muscle cells are discussed in Raines
and Ferri’s contribution to this series (2). The purpose of
this review is to focus on the effects of cytokines on macro-
phages in the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions. This is a
vast literature that has necessitated some selectivity in the
areas that can be covered. Given the subject area of this
journal, we have elected to focus particular attention on
 
the effect of cytokines on lipid metabolism in macro-
phages.
MACROPHAGE FUNCTIONS IN 
ATHEROSCLEROTIC LESIONS
Macrophages are hypothesized to be attracted to the
subendothelial space to remove noxious materials depos-
ited at atherosclerosis-prone regions of arteries. The pre-
cise chemical identity of the substance that attracts macro-
phages has not been unequivocally defined, although
many candidate molecules are components of modified
lipoproteins (3, 4). However, the function of infiltrating
cells becomes subverted and leads to their retention
within the subendothelial space. In this region, it is pro-
posed that macrophages modify adjacent lipoproteins
while also providing major mechanisms of removal for
modified materials from the extracellular environment.
The combination of lipoprotein modification and uptake
leads to macrophages becoming engorged with lipids and
resulting in a morphology that is given the descriptive name
of “foam cells.” Lipid engorgement causes pronounced
cellular hypertrophy, with the cell diameter being 
 

 
10
times that of the originating monocyte. Probably as a
result of the immense size increase, lipid-laden macro-
phages are chronically entrapped in the subendothelial
space. Trapped macrophages can then invoke processes
that perpetuate the continual recruitment of monocytes,
leading to an expanded lesion volume. In addition, the
subendothelial macrophages can influence the behavior
of neighboring cell types within atherosclerotic lesions.

Cytokines and macrophages 1813
 
This includes the well-characterized interaction of macro-
phages and T-lymphocytes (5). During late stages of ath-
erosclerosis development, exposure of macrophage-rich
areas of lesions provides a nidus for thrombus attachment
that is thought to account for a high proportion of the cat-
astrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. At each stage
of lesion development described above, cytokine interac-
tions with macrophages have the potential to be major de-
terminants of the mechanism and magnitude of the re-
sponse.
EXPERIMENTAL MODES IN ELUCIDATING 
MACROPHAGE BIOLOGY IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS
The macrophage is probably the most phenotypically
diverse cell type in the body (6). From the common origin
of monocytes, macrophages take on different characteris-
tics that are presumably determined by the local milieu of
the tissue into which they migrate. Although dissimilar be-
tween tissues, macrophages within a specific tissue have
less heterogeneity. However, this is not the case in athero-
sclerosis, in which there are considerable variances in the
structures of macrophages that may reflect a divergent ar-
ray of functional abilities.
Many contributions to our knowledge of cytokine ef-
fects on macrophage biology in atherosclerosis are de-
rived from studies of cultured cells. The classic system in
this area of investigation is primary cultures of macro-
phages derived from peritoneal lavage of mice (7). Many
studies have also used macrophages derived from human
monocytes. In addition to primary cells, there are also a
wide variety of macrophage-like cell lines. Some of the
most commonly used cell lines include the human-derived
THP-1 (8) and the mouse lines J774 and P388D1 (9, 10).
Although these cultured cells have some macrophage
characteristics, the extent to which they mimic the cells
present in atherosclerosis remains an open question. The
assessment of similarities and differences of macrophages
in culture versus those within atherosclerotic lesions is
hampered by the fluid nature of macrophage phenotypes
and the dearth of reagents to specifically define these phe-
notypes. The combination of this extensive heterogeneity
and the imprecision of phenotyping may contribute to the
conflicting reports of the effects of cytokines on some
properties of macrophage biology that are described in
this review.
CYTOKINE REGULATION OF MACROPHAGE-
MEDIATED LIPOPROTEIN MODIFICATION
An early event in the development of atherosclerotic le-
sions is the subendothelial deposition of lipoproteins (11,
12). The presence of lipoproteins in the subendothelial
space leads to substances that promote both chemotaxis
and lipid accumulation in macrophages. Several modifica-
tions can promote both of these properties (3, 13). In the
early phases of lesion formation, lipoprotein modification
occurs, presumably mostly mediated by endothelial mech-
anisms (14). However, once atherogenesis has been initi-
ated, macrophages may become a major cell type respon-
sible for lipoprotein modification within lesions.
There have been several pathways proposed for lipopro-
tein modification that are regulated by interactions of cy-
tokines with macrophages. Much of the focus of the study
of these modifications has been on oxidative mechanisms.
Oxidation of LDL by cultured mouse peritoneal mac-
rophages, as defined by the content of thiobarbituric
acid-reacting substances, is decreased by incubating cells
with interferon (IFN)-
 

 
 (15). One potential mechanism
of IFN-
 

 
-induced reduction of LDL oxidation is an accel-
eration of extracellular tryptophan degradation (16). Sev-
eral reports have demonstrated a role of IFN-
 

 
 via a lipox-
ygenase pathway that is also thought to involve oxidation
(17). Lipoxygenase, specifically the 15-isoenzyme, is ex-
pressed in lesional macrophages and colocalizes with im-
munologically defined oxidative epitopes of lipoproteins
(18, 19). Expression of the enzyme in macrophages has
been shown to promote atherosclerosis and lipoprotein
oxidation (20–22), although there are contrary data (23,
24). 15-Lipoxygenase is not expressed in cultured human
monocytes, but its expression is profoundly stimulated by
incubation with interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13 (25, 26). The
stimulation of lipoxygenase expression in these cells is ab-
lated by coincubation with IFN-
 

 
 (25). However, incuba-
tion of IFN-
 

 
 with mouse peritoneal macrophages, which
contain abundant lipoxygenase activity on isolation, does
not influence lipoxygenase protein abundance or activity
(27). Therefore, the effect of IFN-
 

 
 appears to be via a
mechanism that inhibits the synthesis of the lipoxygenase.
The contribution of these cytokines to lipoxygenase regu-
lation in vivo is unclear, because mice deficient in IL-4 do
not have reduced expression of lipoxygenase (27). This
may be attributable to the continued presence of IL-13
(26). However, lipoxygenase expression is unexpectedly
increased in total lymphocyte-deficient mice that are as-
sumed to have low circulating concentrations of cytokines.
Also, there is no effect of STAT-6 deficiency, which is a
common pathway for the effects of both IL-4 and IL-13
(28).
Myeloperoxidase is present in large amounts in mono-
cytes and has been proposed as a major oxidative enzyme
in atherosclerosis (29). The role of myeloperoxidase in
the development of atherosclerosis has not been defined,
although the protein and many oxidative products of its
activity have been detected in lesions (29–32). The cyto-
kine regulation of myeloperoxidase in macrophages has
been given limited attention. Granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), but not monocyte
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), increases the expres-
sion of myeloperoxidase in macrophages (33).
Lipoproteins can also be modified within lesions by
nonoxidative processes. These include the effects of LPL
expressed in macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions (34).
The absence of LPL in macrophages decreases atheroscle-
rosis (35, 36), whereas overexpression in this cell type in-
creases lesion size (37). IFN-
 

 
 decreases the expression of
 1814 Journal of Lipid Research
 
Volume 46, 2005
 
LPL in human monocyte-derived macrophages from early
to late stages of culture (38, 39) and by transcriptional
regulation (40). Macrophage LPL expression is also inhib-
ited by transforming growth factor (TGF)-
 

 
 through a tran-
scriptional effect (41, 42), but it is upregulated by tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-
 

 
 (43). Thus, there is substantial ev-
idence that cytokine regulation may be an important con-
tributor to the atherogenic effects of macrophage-expressed
LPL. Although LPL can modify specific lipoprotein frac-
tions, it is possible that nonlipolytic properties of the pro-
tein are responsible for its effects in atherogenesis (44).
CYTOKINE REGULATION OF LIPOPROTEIN ENTRY 
INTO MACROPHAGES
One of the most prominent changes in macrophages af-
ter entry into the subendothelial space of developing ath-
erosclerotic lesions is the engorgement of these cells with
lipid. Intracellular lipid stores are initially formed with
simple droplet morphology. With progressive lipid engorge-
ment, there is the formation of intracellular complexes of
cholesterol and phospholipid and cholesterol crystals (45,
46). These complexes and crystals are frequently encased
by an acid phosphatase-positive layer, consistent with en-
trapment in lysosomes or late endosomes.
It is now recognized that many receptors are present on
macrophages that bind a wide range of native and modi-
fied lipoproteins. Several major receptor types that recog-
nize native lipoproteins may be regulated by cytokines in
macrophages. LDL receptors have a clearly defined role
in the cholesterol homeostasis of the whole body. Their
role in macrophages has not been explored widely be-
cause of the assumption that they are downregulated in
lipid-laden lesional macrophages. However, LDL receptor
protein is detectable in experimental atherosclerotic le-
sions (47, 48). Furthermore, macrophage LDL receptors
influence atherogenesis under conditions of modest hy-
perlipidemia (48, 49). The expression of LDL receptors
on macrophages in cultured cells is a function of the ori-
gin and differentiation status (50). Macrophage LDL re-
ceptors have been demonstrated to be upregulated and
downregulated by IFN-
 

 
 and TGF-
 

 
, respectively (41, 51).
Expression of LDL receptors may also have implications
on the mode of metabolism of the highly atherogenic lipo-
protein fraction, 
 

 
-VLDL, which may have characteristics
similar to those of postprandial chylomicron lipoproteins
(48, 49).
In addition to LDL receptors, 
 

 
-VLDL is also recog-
nized by VLDL receptors. This receptor type is also ex-
pressed on macrophages and is downregulated by IFN-
 

 
(52). The functional significance of this downregulation
can be shown by the inhibition of 
 

 
-VLDL-induced foam
cell formation by IFN-
 

 
.
Another lipoprotein receptor type that recognizes na-
tive lipoproteins is the low density lipoprotein receptor-
related protein (LRP; also designated CD91) (53, 54). Al-
though the embryonic lethality of LRP-deficient mice has
impeded a full characterization of its function, its proper-
ties appear consistent with being the major system for the
clearance of chylomicron remnants from the plasma (54).
LRP on macrophages has consistently been shown to be
downregulated in the presence of IFN-
 

 
 (55–57). Con-
versely, TGF-
 

 
 upregulates macrophage LRP, whereas
M-CSF has no effect (56). These changes in macrophage
LRP expression may have implications for lipoprotein ac-
cumulation within lesional macrophages. LRP, which is
also termed the 
 

 
2 macroglobulin receptor, has a wide
range of ligands in addition to lipoproteins (54). Many of
these ligands are responsible for regulating the extracellu-
lar proteolytic environment of macrophages (58).
Although there has been limited work on the cytokine
regulation of native lipoprotein receptors, there has been
considerable effort to study the cytokine regulation of re-
ceptors for modified lipoproteins. As discussed in the pre-
ceding section, there are several mechanisms of lipopro-
tein modification that can be regulated by cytokines.
Many of these modifications involve some form of oxida-
tive damage. The original receptor for modified lipopro-
teins was designated a “scavenger receptor” based on its
ability to mediate the endocytosis of acetylated LDL (59).
There are now many proteins that have been designated
as scavenger receptors that are broadly classified by gross
structural characteristics in an alphabetic system (8).
The initially discovered scavenger receptor is now re-
ferred to as class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) (60). This
receptor is able to transport acetylated and oxidized forms
of LDL into macrophages by a process that is not down-
regulated by intracellular cholesterol content (61). Sev-
eral studies have used genetically manipulated mice to de-
fine the effect of SR-A on atherosclerotic lesion formation
(62). The ability of cytokines to regulate the SR-A recep-
tor has been the subject of many publications, of which
some selected examples are summarized in 
 
Table 1
 
. IFN-
 

 
is the most widely investigated cytokine. Earlier studies
demonstrated a downregulation of SR-A by IFN-
 

 
 in hu-
man monocyte-derived macrophages (63, 64). IFN-
 

 
 has
also been reported to inhibit SR-A at the transcriptional
level (65). Decreased foam cell formation occurs by the
incubation of IFN-
 

 
 with modified lipoprotein and macro-
phages (64). These effects, combined with studies on
smooth muscle proliferation (66, 67), suggest that IFN-
 

 
may reduce the atherogenic process. However, there are
also reports of IFN-
 

 
 having other effects on SR-A activity,
protein, and transcription that are either neutral or in-
hibitory (27, 68, 69). Markedly different results have also
been reported for GM-CSF, which has shown both upregu-
lation and downregulation of SR-A activity by this cytokine
(27, 70). These differing responses may be a reflection of
the heterogeneity of macrophages, which may lead to dif-
ferences in the phenotype of the cultured cells. Consistent
with this theme, IFN-
 

 
 increases SR-A expression in the
early differentiation phase of blood-borne monocytes or
the human cell line THP-1, but it downregulates this re-
ceptor in mature macrophages (69). These conflicting
findings may also be related to the mode of data represen-
tation, because both IFN-
 

 
 and GM-CSF may markedly in-
crease cellular protein content without influencing cell

number. Under these conditions, the normalization of
data to either cellular protein or cell number can dramat-
ically influence the conclusion of the study.
Lipopolysaccharide downregulates SR-A both in cul-
tured cells and in vivo (71, 72), although induction has
also been shown in both primary macrophage cells and
mouse macrophage-like cell lines (73). Of the many cyto-
kines released after the incubation of macrophages with
lipopolysaccharide, the downregulation of SR-A has been
attributed to the secretion of TNF-
 

 
 (71). Consistent with
this effect, SR-A is downregulated by incubation of cultured
macrophages with TNF-
 

 
 (74). Furthermore, deficiency
of the TNF-
 

 
 receptor, p55, has been associated with in-
creased SR-A expression in atherosclerotic lesions (75).
Some of the inconsistencies in SR-A expression during
TNF-
 

 
 incubation may be attributable to temporal consid-
erations. Indeed, SR-A expression in macrophages has
been shown to be increased before the subsequent inhibi-
tion (76).
In addition to the extensive literature on the effects of
IFN-
 

 
, CSFs, and TNF-
 

 
 on SR-A regulation, there are a
smaller number of publications that have studied the ef-
fects of other cytokines on this receptor. These are also
summarized in Table 1.
Compared with SR-A, there is a relatively modest litera-
ture on the role of cytokines in regulating other scavenger
receptors. CD36 is a receptor that has a number of diverse
properties, including the binding of modified forms of lipo-
proteins, although its ability to facilitate endocytosis of
these particles is not universally accepted (77). CD36 defi-
ciency has been shown to decrease the extent of athero-
sclerosis, primarily through a macrophage-mediated ef-
fect (78, 79). The expression of CD36 on macrophages is
increased by IL-4 and M-CSF (80, 81). The effects of IFN-
 

 
and TGF-
 

 
 on CD36 expression in macrophages have been
inconsistent (81–85).
The lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein recep-
tor-1 (LOX-1) was originally identified in endothelium
and subsequently shown to be expressed in macrophages
(86, 87). Much of the focus of the study of its regulation
has been on endothelial cells. In macrophages, variable
effects of TGF-
 

 
1 on LOX-1 regulation have been reported,
although TNF-
 

 
 has consistently been shown to upregu-
late this receptor (88–90).

Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) was originally
identified as a protein that binds oxidized LDL before the
realization that it is a physiologically important HDL re-
ceptor (91, 92). SR-BI is expressed in macrophages and is
distinct from the other receptors discussed above in that it
can transfer lipid bidirectionally (8). The presence of SR-
BI in macrophages has important consequences on the
development of atherosclerosis, although the effect is
complex, as may be expected for a receptor with this dual-
ity of function (93, 94). SR-BI expression is variable in
macrophages present in atherosclerotic lesions (95). The
mechanisms responsible for this variable SR-BI expression
have not been determined. In the scant cytokine litera-
ture, it has been demonstrated that both IFN-
 

 
 and TNF-
 

 
downregulate SR-BI (96).
Overall, there are many receptors that facilitate the entry
of native and modified lipoproteins into macrophages by
transfer of either the whole particle or selective components.
Although there has been some consistency in the effects of
selected cytokines in regulating some of these receptors on
macrophages, there are also many inconsistencies in the lit-
erature. Resolution of these conflicting results needs to ac-
count for the many variables in these studies, such as macro-
phage phenotype and temporal effects.
CYTOKINE REGULATION OF INTRACELLULAR 
LIPID DISTRIBUTION AND REMOVAL
The previous section described processes that predomi-
nantly influence the mass of cholesterol transported into
the intracellular compartment. The mode in which cho-
lesterol is distributed within macrophages has dramatic ef-
fects on its toxicity and availability for efflux. With regard
to toxicity, unesterified cholesterol appears to be benign
when excess is stored in lysosomes, but it has profound ef-
fects on cell function and viability when present in high
concentrations in the cell membrane (97, 98). Efflux of
cholesterol is dependent on several known variables, in-
cluding the efficiency of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and
transport pathways involved in shuttling cholesterol to the
cell surface and its subsequent removal.
In addition to its role in macrophage-mediated lipopro-
tein modification and uptake, IFN-
 

 
 has also been exten-
sively studied with regard to its effects on macrophage
lipid metabolism (
 
Table 2
 
). IFN-
 

 
 is the only cytokine in
which a change in intracellular cholesterol storage has been
demonstrated, with an increased cholesteryl ester pool
and decreased cholesterol efflux (82, 99). This increase
could be accomplished by increased activity of ACAT-1,
which esterifies cholesterol to cholesteryl ester. The activ-
ity of this enzyme is increased in macrophages incubated
with IFN-
 

 
 (100). M-CSF and TGF-
 

 
1 also increase ACAT-1
activity (101, 102). The effect of these cytokines on intra-
cellular cholesterol distribution has not been determined.
The removal of cholesterol from the cell requires the
hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester, which is achieved by either
acid or neutral forms of cholesteryl ester hydrolase. The
cytokine regulation of these enzymes is not well studied,
with only one report demonstrating the increased activity
of both forms of cholesteryl ester hydrolase after incu-
bation of macrophages with M-CSF (102). Another cho-
lesterol removal process is via the activity of cholesterol
27-hydroxylase, which is known to be present in many ex-
trahepatic cells, including macrophages (103). Cholesterol
27-hydroxylase converts cholesterol to more polar prod-
ucts that are readily removed from macrophages. This
process is upregulated by IFN-
 

 
 (104, 105).
The secretion of cholesterol from macrophages is influ-
enced by the ability to secrete apolipoprotein E (apoE),
which has been demonstrated to promote cholesterol
efflux, particularly when endogenously produced (106–
108). IFN-
 

 
 decreases apoE secretion via a posttransla-
tional mechanism (109). Several other cytokines have also
been demonstrated to regulate apoE secretion, although
these have not been linked to changes in cholesterol ef-
flux (Table 2).
ABCA1 has a well-defined role in cholesterol efflux in
many cell types, including macrophages (110). The cyto-
kine regulation of ABCA1 in macrophages is consistent
with its role in efflux. For example, decreased abundance
after IFN-
 

 
 incubation was associated with decreased HDL
binding and cholesterol efflux. This effect was indepen-
dent of changes in the expression of SR-BI (111, 112).

Conversely, TGF-1 increased ABCA1 expression and cho-
lesterol efflux (41, 105, 113), although the binding of HDL
was decreased by this cytokine (85).
Cytokines have many effects on macrophages with re-
gard to intracellular cholesterol metabolism and its conse-
quences on sterol efflux. With few anomalies, the most
extensively studied cytokine, IFN-, increases intracellular
cholesterol storage when cells are not incubated with
modified lipoproteins. Further studies to demonstrate
whether these changes affect macrophage viability would
be of interest (98).
CYTOKINE REGULATION OF THE 
EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX OF MACROPHAGES
The extracellular matrix of the artery contains many
different proteins. The subendothelial region contains type
IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. The integrity of ex-
tracellular matrix proteins in atherosclerotic lesions may
be compromised by a large number of enzymes, most of
which belong to the matrix metalloproteinease (MMP),
cysteine protease, or serine protease families.
Many MMPs have been detected in atherosclerosis,
although the dominant MMPs expressed by macro-
phages that have been implicated in lesion development
are MMP-9 and MMP-12. Of these MMPs, only MMP-9 has
been shown to alter the atherogenic process with its defi-
ciency, reducing lesion size in several vascular areas (114).
Moreover, this study demonstrated that bone marrow-
derived stem cells were a significant source of the MMP-9
that modulates atherogenesis.
The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 attenuated MMP-9
expression and activation in peripheral blood mono-
cytes, mouse peritoneal macrophages, and human alveo-
lar macrophages (115–117). Activation of MMP-9 is tightly
regulated by tissue inhibitor of MMP-1, which is markedly
upregulated by IL-10 (117, 118). TGF- decreases lipopolysac-
charide-induced MMP-9 expression and activation in cul-
tured MM6 and RAW 264.7 cells (119). Conversely, TNF-
upregulated MMP-9 in human peripheral blood mono-
cytes and peritoneal macrophages (120, 121). However,
the effect of IFN- on the regulation of MMP-9 is unclear,
with some studies demonstrating that it upregulates MMP-9
in mouse peritoneal macrophages and others suggesting
that it downregulates MMP-9 (122–125).
CYTOKINE REGULATION OF COAGULATION
IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS
The presence of tissue factor in atherosclerotic lesions
is proposed to exert a major effect on the development of
atherosclerosis complications at late stages of the disease
(126). Tissue factor is expressed in all of the major cell
types of atherosclerotic lesions, with a preponderance in
macrophages (127, 128). Tissue factor expression in cul-
tured macrophages is downregulated by the Th2 cyto-
kines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, whereas the Th1 cytokine
IFN- has the opposite effect (129, 130). Some of the ef-
fects on tissue factor expression, particularly those of IFN-,
are differentiation-specific (131, 132). Overall, there is
limited information regarding the role of cytokine-macro-
phage interactions on the effect of coagulation responses
in atherosclerotic lesions.
EXTRAPOLATION OF CYTOKINE EFFECTS ON 
CULTURED CELLS TO THE ATHEROGENIC 
PROCESS IN VIVO
There have been numerous studies to determine the
role of specific cytokines in the development of athero-
sclerosis. As described above, one cytokine that has been
studied extensively in cell culture studies is IFN-, which is
also one of the more extensively investigated cytokines in
in vivo studies of atherogenesis. Studies with cultured cells
have demonstrated many effects of IFN- on the intra-
cellular accumulation of lipids in macrophages. These
findings lead to the notion that IFN- would retard ath-
erosclerosis, especially by minimizing intracellular lipid
accumulation in macrophages. However, there are con-
flicting results in cultured cells. In contrast, the effects of
IFN- on the development of atherosclerosis in mouse
models of the disease have been quite consistent, but they
have contradicted the original concept of IFN- being
antiatherogenic. Thus, deletion of both IFN- and its re-
ceptor decreased the size of atherosclerotic lesions in
apoE-deficient mice (133, 134). Deletion of IFN- also de-
creased the size of atherosclerotic lesions in LDL recep-
tor-deficient mice (135). Conversely, exogenous adminis-
tration of IFN- or its upstream regulators, IL-12 or IL-18,
increased the extent of atherosclerosis (136–138). Cur-
rently, the only published report suggesting an antiathero-
genic role for IFN- comes from a study of irradiated LDL
receptor-deficient mice that were repopulated with cells
from IFN--deficient mice. Under these conditions, the
absence of IFN- in bone marrow-derived stem cells in-
creased the size of lesions in three different vascular re-
gions (139).
Although gene manipulation and exogenous cytokine
administration have provided valuable insight into the
atherogenic process, these do not localize the effect to a
specific action of the cytokine on macrophages. One
mode of focusing on cytokine-macrophage interactions is
to use mice that are deficient in specific cytokine recep-
tors. Previous studies have used the technique of bone
marrow transplantation as a mode of determining a leuko-
cyte-specific role in atherosclerosis (140, 141). This ap-
proach has been used in the chemokine field, for ex-
ample, in studies using CCR2 and CXCR-2 (142, 143).
However, bone marrow transplantation studies with cyto-
kine receptor-deficient mice have not been performed to
date. Although such studies provide valuable insight, their
interpretation should be tempered by the potential for
bone marrow-derived stem cells to differentiate beyond
myeloid and lymphoid lineages (144, 145). Thus, the defi-
nition of an interaction of a macrophage with a specific
1818 Journal of Lipid Research Volume 46, 2005
cytokine as a functionally significant event in atherogene-
sis will be facilitated by the ability to specifically regulate
cytokine receptors in this cell type.
CONCLUSIONS
The macrophage is a pivotal cell type throughout the
initiation and maturation of atherosclerotic lesions. The
combination of the many cytokines present in atheroscle-
rotic lesions and the abundant cytokine receptors on mac-
rophages is consistent with an important role of cytokine-
macrophage interactions in lesion development. How-
ever, the abundance of both cytokines and receptors on
macrophages also provides some challenges to unequivo-
cally determining the relative importance and mechanism
of a specific cytokine. The most obvious road ahead is
the use of molecular engineering to enable the ablation
and enhancement of cytokine responses in macrophages.
With the increasing identification of specific cytokine re-
ceptors, coupled with evolving modes of altering gene ex-
pression in macrophages (146, 147), it is likely that this
will spawn many studies to elucidate the role of cytokine
interactions with macrophages.
