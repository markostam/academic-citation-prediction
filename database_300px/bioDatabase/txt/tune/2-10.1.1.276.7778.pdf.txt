ABSTRACT
A number of groups have developed libraries of
siRNAs to identify genes through functional
genomics. While these studies have validated the
approach of making functional RNAi libraries to
understand fundamental cellular mechanisms, they
require information and knowledge of existing
sequences since the RNAi sequences are generated
synthetically. An alternative strategy would be to
create an RNAi library from cDNA. Unfortunately, the
complexity of such a library of siRNAs would make
screening difficult. To reduce the complexity, longer
dsRNAs could be used; however, concerns of
induction of the interferon response and off-target
effects of long dsRNAs have prevented their use.
As a first step in creating such libraries, long
dsRNA was expressed in mammalian cells. The
250 nt dsRNAs were capable of efficiently silencing
a luciferase reporter gene that was stably trans-
fected in MDA-MB-231 cells without inducing the
interferon response or off-target effects any more
than reported for siRNAs. In addition, a long dsRNA
expressed in the same cell line was capable of
silencing endogenous c-met expression and inhib-
ited cell migration, whereas the dsRNA against
luciferase had no effect on c-met or cell migration.
The studies suggest that large dsRNA libraries are
feasible and that functional selection of genes will
be possible.
INTRODUCTION
A number of different approaches have been advanced to
validate the function of genes, including the function of a
number of genes involved in cancer cell migration and inva-
sion. The use of RNAi is generally regarded to be one of the
most promising approaches since, at least in non-mammalian
systems, it acts systemically (1), thus providing the potential
to carry out both in vitro and in vivo target validation. RNAi
was initially described in plants, where it was believed to play
a key role in protection against viral pathogens (2). The path-
way involves a dsRNA of >21 bp triggering an RNaseIII-like
enzyme now called Dicer (3–5). Dicer cleaves long dsRNAs,
into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21–25 bp. These
siRNAs are then incorporated into a multi-subunit RNA-
induced silencing complex (RISC), which acts catalytically
to target degradation of cellular mRNA in a sequence depen-
dent manner (6,7). Given the systemic and catalytic nature of
RNAi, this class of molecules has been proposed for use
both in target identification/validation and the development
of therapeutics (8,9). While the great majority of the target
validation studies using RNAi have been focused on a spe-
cific target, the efficiency of RNAi has led to the recognition
that this technology may represent an exceptionally strong
approach to functional genomics through the creation of
RNAi libraries.
Libraries of siRNA molecules targeting a specific gene
can be produced synthetically, although new enzymatic
approaches (10) have reduced the time and costs associated
with producing libraries, and allow for the selection of the
siRNA with the highest level of activity against the target
of interest. Functional RNAi libraries have been designed
and synthesized to study cytoskeleton organization in
Drosophila (11) and are being used extensively to study
gene function in Caenorhabditis elegans, including the
functional analysis of entire chromosomes and the full gen-
ome (12,13), but have only recently been described for use
in mammalian systems (14). While the above laboratories
reported the ability to generate functional libraries of siRNAs
against specific targets and the ability to generate a complex,
415 000 member siRNA library from an existing cDNA
library, they did not report that this latter library was func-
tional. The authors go on to report that they generate on aver-
age 34 unique siRNA clones per kilobase of sequence, a
distinct advantage since not all siRNAs are active. However,
this also points out the limitations of generating siRNA
libraries. Significantly larger libraries will be required to
ensure that active siRNAs are present for each transcript.

Other approaches have recently been undertaken to develop
functional siRNA libraries ranging from 500 to 8000
known genes (15,16). Plasmids and retroviral vectors have
also been used to generate libraries of short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) of similar size to the larger siRNA library
(17,18), with which genetic screens have been carried out
to identify tumor suppressor genes (18–20). Recently,
libraries corresponding to most known human and mouse
genes have been developed (21). Many of these si-and
shRNA libraries are commercially available and a database,
RNAi Codex, has been developed to annotate the data gener-
ated in the various studies (22).
While the above strategies have demonstrated promise for
functional genomic screening, most are based on developing
libraries using known sequences and when a random library
was generated, the complexity was significant. An alternative
approach to that taken in generating the random siRNA
library (14), would be to restriction digest cDNA to generate
a library of long dsRNAs. Long dsRNA libraries have
been used to analyze gene function in Drosophila (23,24)
but potential off-target effects and induction of the stress
response are issues for mammalian gene silencing. Thus,
the focus of this study was to analyze the efficiency, selectiv-
ity and toxicity of long dsRNAs in mammalian cells and to
determine whether long dsRNAs lead to the desired biologi-
cal response in these cells, as a first step to generate long
dsRNA libraries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid construction, primers and probes
For the construction of the vectors containing dual, conver-
gent promoters for expressing dsRNA molecules, two dif-
ferent polIII human promoters, U6 from psiSTRIKE-U6
(Promega) and H1 from pSilencer 3.0-H1 (Ambion), were
cloned into pGEM3Z (Promega) (see Supplemental
Figure 1). The primers (obtained from Invitrogen) used to
amplify these promoters by PCR were designed to contain
unique restriction sites at the 50 and 30 ends for cloning (see
Supplemental Table 1) and a TTTTT stretch in the reverse
primers to create the polIII termination signal.
The firefly luciferase fragments were generated by PCR
amplification from pMS110 (Message Pharmaceuticals)
using primer pairs (Invitrogen) each containing a KpnI
restriction site (see Supplemental Table 1). Following ampli-
fication, the luciferase fragments were cloned into the KpnI
site in pGEM/U6/H1.
The c-met gene (gb accession number: NM_000245) was
targeted with a long dsRNA generated by cloning the region
between 3209 and 3330 into the KpnI site of pGEM/U6/H1
vector using the primer pair (Invitrogen) described in Supple-
mental Table 1.
The following customized primers and probe sets for qRT–
PCR and qPCR plasmid quantification were purchased from

TCATGCCGACAAGTG-30.
Cell culture and transfection
MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1),
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 mg/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml
streptomycin, 40 mg/ml gentamycin, 0.4 mM sodium pyru-
vate and 2 mM L-glutamine. MCF-7 cells permanently trans-
fected with pMS110 (a generous gift from Message
Pharmaceutics) were maintained in DMEM and 10% FBS,
containing the supplements described above. Twenty-four
hours after plating, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 96-well, 6-well or T75 flasks
as necessary for the desired number of cells.
Luciferase experiments
MDA-MB-231 cells permanently expressing the pMS110
plasmid containing firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231/FFLuc)
or the permanently transfected MCF-7 cell line (Message
Pharmaceuticals) were seeded in 96-well culture plates at
104 cells/well and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA). Each well received 45 ng pGEM/U6/
H1/dsRNALuc expression vector. All samples were trans-
fected in triplicate and the experiment was performed a mini-
mum of three times. For control transfections, empty vector
pGEM/U6/H1 was included. The luciferase assays were per-
formed 24 h after transfection using the Bright Glo Luciferase
Assay system according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega, Madison, WI) with activity quantified on a
Lucy II (Rosys Anthos) luminometer.
Interferon b analysis
To determine whether expression of long dsRNA induced the
interferon response in mammalian cells, 2 · 105 of MDA-
MB-231 or MCF-7 cells were plated on 6-well plates, then
24 h later pGEM/U6/H1 or one of the four pGEM/U6/
H1dsRNAFFLuc were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000. Forty-eight hours after transfection interferon b levels
in the media were analyzed. To confirm that each cell line
retained an inducible interferon-b pathway, the interferon
response was assessed against an adenovirus infection. As
above, 2 · 105 of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were
plated on 6-well plates then 24 h later, adenovirus was
introduced at a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 0, 5,
50 and 500 for 4 h. Thereafter, the media was replaced
without adenovirus and incubated for an additional 48 h. At
the end of each experiment, 220 ml media was collected
and the level of secreted interferon-b was determined using
the Human INF-beta ELISA kit (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Transwell migration assay
MDA-MB-231/FFLuc cells were grown in T75 flasks and
transfected with the desired dsRNA expression vector.
Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were har-
vested for the migration assay by trypsinization, suspended
in DMEM/F12 without serum and seeded at densities of
2 · 104 or 106 cells per well in 24 or 6 well transwell inserts,
3804 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 13
respectively. The lower chamber was supplemented with
DMEM/F12 medium with 10% serum. The upper and lower
chambers were separated by an 8 mm pore polycarbonate
membrane (Costar, Corning, NY) that was coated with
50 or 500 mL of 0.5 mg/mL Matrigel (Becton Dickinson).
After 48 h of incubation at 37C, the cells in the bottom
well were harvested with trypsin and counted for invasion
index evaluation (24-well) and RNA or DNA were extracted
(6-well) for qRT–PCR and microarray hybridization or
plasmid partition quantification, respectively. The number
of migrating cells was determined by counting a 10 ml aliquot
using a haemocytometer (Neubauer). For each experiment of
invasion index evaluation (invasion index ¼ percentage of
cells that migrated from the total number of plated cells),
values were normalized to the empty vector transfected
cells set at 100%.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) from
MDA-MB-231 FFLuc cells 48 h after transfection with either
pGEM/U6/H1 or pGEM/U6/H1dsRNAFFLuc. The estimated
transcript concentrations of the human c-met, GAPDH and
firefly luciferase genes were based on the comparison of the
target transcript PCR signal in dsRNA expression vector
transfected cells to the signal measured in an empty vector
transfected control. Analysis was done using the 2–DDCT
method, which first normalizes the RNA levels of the gene
of interest to a housekeeping gene then normalizes this relat-
ive RNA level to that of the control treatment group, as
described by Livak and Schmittgen (25) for target gene
transcripts and interpolation from standard curves for abso-
lute quantification of plasmid partitioning. The TaqMan
PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with a 7700 ABI Detector
(Applied Biosystems) was used for analysis. cDNA was syn-
thesized from 1 mg of the total RNA using TaqMan Reverse
Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems) for use in the
microarray experiments. Pre-designed, gene-specific TaqMan
probe and primer sets (Applied Biosystems), consisting of
a specific fluorogenic probe and a pair of oligonucleotides,
were used to run standard qPCRs for human c-met, GAPDH
and firefly luciferase genes. cDNA (0.1 ng) was used for all
genes and 5 mg DNA for plasmid quantification. The reac-
tions were carried out in triplicate in a 50 ml reaction volume
and a 96-well plate format.
Microarray hybridization
Total RNA was extracted as described above. Quality of
each sample was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Biotinylated cRNA
was synthesized from total RNA (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY).
Following processing according to the Affymetrix GeneChip
Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA), the labeled cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix
U133A GeneChips and the resulting expression levels were
quantified. Comparative analysis of the two samples was
performed with the statistical algorithm of MAS 5.0 software
(Affymetrix) by scaling at fixed target intensity of 150, a
fold change of 1.5 (approximate signal log ratio of 0.6)
and P-value < 0.01. Comparison results were expressed
as percentage change in the study, by measuring the
fluorescence signal of the targets on the array.
Statistical analysis
With the exception of the microarray data, all data were
analyzed using the Sigma Plot 8.02 statistical software pack-
age (SPSS Inc. 2002). All quantitative values were expressed
and plotted as mean ± SEM. Comparisons were evaluated by
the unpaired Student’s t-test. A value of P < 0.01 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
RESULTS
To create vectors containing dual, convergent promoters for
expressing dsRNA molecules two different polIII promoters,
U6 and H1, were cloned into pGEM3Z. The primers used
to amplify these promoters were designed to contain unique
restriction sites at the 50 and 30 ends for cloning and a
TTTTT stretch in the reverse primers to create a strong polIII
termination signal. To test various long dsRNAs, regions of
the firefly luciferase gene were amplified by PCR and cloned
into a KpnI site between the two promoters. Sequences of
250, 500, 750 and 1000 bp (see Supplemental Figure 2)
were tested for their ability to inhibit firefly luciferase activity
in a MDA-MB-231 cell line that stably expressed firefly
luciferase. Each of the constructs were capable of silencing
luciferase activity 48 h after transfection with inhibition rang-
ing from 20% for the 500 bp sequence to 80% for the 250 bp
sequence (Figure 1). A second cell line, MCF-7, was also
transfected with the plasmid generating the 250 bp luciferase
dsRNA. Similar to the MDA-MB-231 transfected cells, the
dsRNA resulted in a 60% reduction of luciferase activity.
For both the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines, silencing
of luciferase expression was consistent with transfection
efficiency. A plasmid expressing GFP was transfected as
described above, 48 h later cells were sorted by FACS and
the transfection efficiencies were determined to be 55 and
41%, respectively.

effects were monitored. The four constructs were analyzed
to determine if expression of long dsRNAs led to the induc-
tion of interferon b in order to assess their capability to
induce the stress response. The MDA-MB-231 cells, which
had previously been shown to possess a functional interferon
pathway (26), were demonstrated in this study to be
b-interferon competent by monitoring secreted interferon b
levels following infection with adenovirus. At 48 h post-
transfection or infection, neither the lipofectamine reagent,
the pGEM/U6/H1 plasmid nor any of the four constructs
led to detection of interferon b whereas adenovirus infec-
tion demonstrated at least a 10-fold induction of interferon
b secreted in the media (Figure 2). Similar results were
observed using MCF-7 cells, with non-transfected and cells
transfected with the 250 bp dsRNA producing essentially
undetectable levels of interferon and adenoviral infected
cells secreting 90 IU/ml, which was 10-fold higher than
non-infected MCF-7 cells. Since, the 250 bp dsRNA resulted
in maximal silencing of luciferase without inducing inter-
feron b in the MDA-MB-231 cells, this construct was used
to analyze off-target effects by expression profiling. Of
22 283 probe sets on the array, 68 were increased by 1.5-
fold and 189 decreased by the same level 48 h after transfec-
tion of this construct (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2).
Interferon b, 20-50 OAS and PKR were found absent, present
and present with no change in the expression level
when compared with vector alone transfected cells,
respectively.
While the above results demonstrate that long dsRNA can
effectively inhibit the expression of a transgene in MDA-MB-
231 cells without inducing the interferon response or strong
off-target effects, the ability to silence an endogenous gene
and generate the expected phenotypic change with long
dsRNA must be assessed. To this end, the ability to silence
c-met and prevent cell migration was analyzed. A dsRNA
corresponding to the region 3209–3300 of the c-met sequence
was cloned into the vector described above and transfected
into MDA-MB-231 cells. The 250 bp luciferase silencing
construct was independently transfected into this cell line
and 48 h after transfection, c-met RNA levels were deter-
mined using quantitative RT–PCR. The c-met dsRNA con-
struct led to a 60% decrease in c-met RNA levels, whereas
the luciferase dsRNA construct did not alter c-met RNA
levels (Figure 3).
The transiently transfected cells were then tested for their
ability to inhibit cell migration using a transwell assay. The
ability of expressed long c-met dsRNA to inhibit migration
was compared with that of an siRNA that had been previously

b levels in the supernatant were measured by ELISA and the IU/ml
determined from a standard curve using recombinant interferon b.

demonstrated to efficiently knock down c-met (27). As can
be seen in Figure 4, both the expressed long dsRNA and
the siRNA inhibited cell migration by 40%. The inability
to inhibit cell migration to higher levels is probably owing
to the inefficiency of transfection, such that the cells that
still migrate may lack plasmid or have significantly less plas-
mid expressing the dsRNA. To address this possibility, the
partitioning of the plasmids expressing long dsRNA between
the migrated and non-migrated cells was quantified using real
time PCR to determine the abundance of plasmid DNA per
unit of total DNA. Standard curves were generated using
the plasmids encoding c-met and luciferase dsRNAs to quant-
ify actual plasmid levels from migrating and non-migrating
cells. As expected, the luciferase plasmid was found at rela-
tively similar levels in both the migrating and non-migrating
cell populations, whereas the c-met plasmid strongly parti-
tioned with the non-migrating population (Figure 5).
In total, these experiments present data that demonstrate
(i) the ability to produce long dsRNA and efficiently silence
gene expression when expressed from a plasmid; (ii) the
lack of interferon induction following transfection and
efficient silencing; (iii) the ability of a long dsRNA (c-met)
to inhibit migration and (iv) the increased partitioning of
this plasmid (c-met) with the non-migrating cells since silenc-
ing of c-met would be expected to lead to prevention of
migration. Similar expression of long dsRNA targeting Arc
and NR1 in a neuronal cell line has also been carried out
and confirms the above observations, both for efficacy of
silencing and lack of interferon induction (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
There are a number of types of dsRNAs that have been used
to silence gene expression. By far the most common of these
is synthetic siRNA. These 21–23 nt RNA molecules are com-
monly used both in vitro and in vivo. Another form of siRNA
commonly used is shRNA, which is generally expressed
intracellularly from a vector. The use of long dsRNAs have
been very limited owing to the belief that these longer regions
of double stranded RNA will result in the induction of the
interferon response (7). However, the above studies demon-
strate that long dsRNAs can be used to silence gene exp-
ression without inducing the stress response or causing
significant off-target effects. The use of long dsRNAs can
provide numerous advantages in that the cell can select the
optimal silencing sequence alleviating the need to test numer-
ous siRNAs; long dsRNAs will allow for silencing libraries to
have less complexity than would be necessary for siRNAs;
and, perhaps most importantly, long dsRNA could prevent
viral escape mutations when used as therapeutics.
One concern with using long dsRNAs randomly generated
from cDNA libraries and expressed from promoters con-
structed of two convergent polIII promoters is premature ter-
mination of the transcript owing to the presence of polIII
terminators. A long stretch of thymidine nucleotides leads
to polIII termination, with a minimum of three necessary
but five being optimal (28). Thus, if a terminator was present
in either the sense or antisense strand very near to the pro-
moter or if terminators for both strands were present adjacent
to one another, it would be possible to generate no dsRNA. It
was interesting to note that the optimal long dsRNA for
silencing luciferase expression was in fact, the shortest of
the sequences. However, when the sequence was analyzed
for stretches of five thymidine nucleotides in either the for-
ward or reverse orientation, the 250 bp sequence generates
a region of 235 bp of dsRNA, whereas the 750 and
1000 bp sequences generate identical 330 bp of dsRNA
and the 500 bp sequence results in a dsRNA of 80 bp, per-
haps explaining its poor silencing activity. These results
demostrate that while the existance of polIII terminators
may prevent some dsRNAs from forming, a stretch of five
thymidines should occur on average once every 1000 bp so
the likelihood that such stretches will occur on opposite
strands of a 250 nt base pair digestion product is remote. In
addition, it is extremely unlikely that if a cDNA was digested
to numerous 250 bp fragments, every fragment would contain
terminators preventing formation of dsRNAs. Thus, use of
random 250 bp regions should result in effective silencing.

the production of numerous siRNAs of 22–23 nt (29). The
presence of numerous fragments against a single target has
the advantage of allowing the cell to select the most efficient
siRNA for target accessibility and by producing numerous
dsRNAs, can offer better potential therapeutic protection
against viral infections by making resistance difficult (9).
However, there has been a long standing belief that long dsR-
NAs induce an interferon response, beginning with dsRNA
viruses induction of a stress response (30–32) and further
supported when early work comparing long dsRNA with siR-
NAs was carried out (7). These studies are often cited as
rationale for working with siRNAs but other studies have
reported that siRNA can also induce an interferon response
in mammalian cells (33,34). Although siRNAs are still
the method of choice for silencing gene expression, there
have been a number of reports in which long dsRNAs have
been used in mammalian cells and in mammals without
signs of toxicity or adverse effects on the animal (35–38).
The lack of interferon response associated with long dsRNA
in this study was an encouraging first step in the development
of libraries since long dsRNA would reduce the required com-
plexity and allow processing to numerous siRNAs intracellu-
larly, enhancing the probability of target acessibility.
A second important consideration when using long dsRNA
is the potential for significant off-target silencing. One of
the proposed strengths of an siRNA is that the 21–23 bp
sequence can be analyzed against the genomic database and
identical matches can be avoided. This becomes difficult, if
not impossible, when using a 250 bp dsRNA that will be
processed into a number of potential overlapping 21–23 bp
siRNAs (29). One of the real strengths of siRNAs was origi-
nally thought to be the exquisite specificity of the interaction.
When a reporter gene, GFP, was used as a target to assess
silencing ot the reporter expression in HEK293 cells, no
detectable secondary effects were noted by genomewide
expression profiling (39) with a similar profiling demonstrat-
ing high specificity when the profiles of three endogenous
genes were compared (40). The tremendous specificity
of the response was also inferred from data generated using
siRNAs as antiviral treatments—resistant viruses were
shown to contain a single nucleotide substitution in the region
corresponding to the sequence of the siRNA (41). More
recently, this specificity has come into question. When similar
expression profiling was carried out using multiple siRNAs
against a MAPK14 or IGF1R, there were reproducible
expression patterns for each siRNA across three experiments
but a set of siRNAs against a given target found only a few
genes regulated similarly for the given target (42). This was
unexpected since siRNAs targeting the same gene should
result in the same changes in an expression profile. They
also reported that the observed off-target effects could not
be titrated out using lower concentrations of siRNA and
that an siRNA targeting luciferase reproducibly silenced
other genes in the absence of any sequence similarity. In
another study, a 21 bp siRNA against luciferase was also
found to elicit significant off-target effects, stimulating or
repressing >1000 genes (43). They explained this, at least
in part, through the induction of the stress response through
the PKR pathway. In light of these latter studies, the several
hundred genes identified by expression analysis in this study
that exhibit an increase or decrease following silencing of
luciferase with long dsRNA were not unexpected for silenc-
ing in general. Although the effectiveness of the luciferase
could not be monitored on the array since its sequence was
not present on the array, analysis of luciferase expression
in a popultion of cells transfected at the same time and in
the same way demonstrated the on-target efficacy of the
dsRNA (data not shown). From these results, long dsRNAs
do not appear to be toxic and the non-specific effects are
modest when compared with those of siRNAs.
We next tested whether a long dsRNA expressed from a
plasmid would not only silence gene expression but would
also result in the desired phenotypic change. To analyze
this activity we choose to attempt to inhibit cell migration
as a strategy for targeting cancer metastasis. The under-
standing of how a primary tumor cell migrates from the
initial tumor, disperses throughout the body in the vascular/
lymphatic system, invades a new site and begins to proliferate
and form secondary tumors in not well understood (44),
although it is well accepted that the mechanisms leading to
metastases will represent attractive therapeutic targets (45).
Since migration and invasion are key components of cellular
metastasis (45,46), these processes have been well studied in
cell culture systems and represent an attractive model to look
at the functional effects of large dsRNAs.
Recently, an siRNA to c-met has been identified and shown
to lead to apoptosis and reduction of tumor growth (27). In
addition, when c-met was knocked-down using ribozymes,
cell invasion and metastasis were inhibited both in vitro
and in mice (47,48). A number of groups are targeting
c-met for therapeutic intervention with small molecules
(49,50) given its important role in tumor metastasis (51).
For these reasons, c-met was used in the present studies as
a positive control dsRNA for cell invasion. When comparing
the dsRNA with the previously reported siRNA, both inhib-
ited cell migration to an identical level. To determine whether
this inhibition was owing to the transfection of the plasmid
containing the dsRNA for c-met, the migrating and non-
migrating populations of cells were compared. While a
plasmid expressing dsRNA against luciferase was found in
equal abundance in the two populations of cells, the plasmid
expressing dsRNA against c-met was enriched almost 4-fold
in the non-migrating cell population. This enrichment is con-
sistent with the loss of c-met function, which should result in
inhibition of migration. Thus, these studies demonstrate the
ability to silence an endogenous gene and obtain the desired
phenotype. The presence of c-met dsRNA plasmid in the
migrating population of cells may represent low number of
copies per cell resulting in low levels of dsRNA that
are insufficient to elicit the change in migration or may rep-
resent a population of the MDA-MD-231 cells whose migra-
tion is not dependent on c-met expression. A further analysis
of this population would be required to better understand the
biological significance of this phenomenon.
Results from these studies have demonstrated the ability
of dsRNA to silence endogenous gene expression, leading
to a biological response, without inducing an interferon
response or significant off-target effects. This is the first
step in creating functional dsRNA libraries. Using long
dsRNAs, libraries can be generated from cells expressing a
phenotype of interest and transfected back into the same
type of cells to look for loss of function. The dsRNA

sequence resulting in loss of function can then be rescued,
sequenced and the isolated sequence further tested for func-
tion. The use of long dsRNAs also offer promise for develop-
ment of therapeutics, particularly since off-target effects are
modest when compared with those found with siRNAs.
