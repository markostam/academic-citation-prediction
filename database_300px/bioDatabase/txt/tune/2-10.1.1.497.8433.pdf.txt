ABSTRACT
DNA microarrays serve to monitor a wide range of
molecular events, but emerging applications like
measurements of weakly expressed genes or of
proteins and their interaction patterns will require
enhanced performance to improve specificity of
detection and dynamic range. To further extend the
utility of DNA microarray-based approaches we
present a high-performance tag microarray proce-
dure that enables probe-based analysis of as little
as 100 target cDNA molecules, and with a linear
dynamic range close to 105. Furthermore, the pro-
tocol radically decreases the risk of cross-
hybridization on microarrays compared to current
approaches, and it also allows for quantification by
single-molecule analysis and real-time on-chip mon-
itoring of rolling-circle amplification. We provide
proof of concept formicroarray-basedmeasurement
of both mRNA molecules and of proteins, converted
to tag DNA sequences by padlock and proximity
probe ligation, respectively.
INTRODUCTION
The DNA microarray technology introduced in the early
1990s allows rapid and cost-eﬀective acquisition of genetic
information (1,2). It has evolved towards greater densities
of arrayed probes, and the probes used have largely shifted
from long cDNA clones (3) to synthetic oligonucleotides.
More recently, assay procedures have been developed to
translate large sets of target sequences into tag sequence
elements that can be sorted on general-purpose tag
microarrays (4–6). The approach has been used for anal-
ysis of single-nucleotide variation (7), mRNA expression
(8), and to investigate splice patterns (5).
Recently, doubts about the reliability of hybridization-
based microarray analyses (9,10) have motivated nucleic
acid analyses by massively parallel sequencing as an
alternative to microarray hybridization (11). Massively
parallel sequencing provides improved ﬁdelity by calling
targets via sequencing, and precise quantitative measure-
ments are achieved by counting individual molecules.
However, throughput and cost of parallel sequencing is
not yet competitive with those of microarrays. Real-time
PCR also improves speciﬁcity of detection over that of
hybridization microarrays, and molecules can be mea-
sured over very wide concentration ranges, but only single
or few sequences can be investigated in each reaction,
limiting throughput (12). A comparison of nucleic acid
analysis techniques is outlined in Supplementary Data
Table 2.
The padlock probes used in the present study, and in
particular a variant thereof called molecular inversion
probes, have been applied for parallel analyses of up to
tens of thousand target nucleic acid sequences in a single
reaction, with excellent sequence speciﬁcity due to the
two target-complementary regions of each individual
probe that become joined by ligation in the presence
of speciﬁc target sequences (13). In a similar manner,
proteins can be measured with so-called proximity probes,
yielding DNA reporter strands that accurately and
sensitively reﬂect the presence of target proteins (14). We
have now developed a dual-tag microarray (DTM) plat-
form, in order to ensure that the speciﬁcity of detection and
dynamic range of padlock and proximity probing reactions
is not lost due to cross reactions when ampliﬁcation
products of reacted probes are sorted on tag arrays.

In the DTM procedure target nucleic acid or protein
molecules are ﬁrst recognized in solution by probes that
include pairs of tag DNA sequences (Figure 1a). Next,
ligated probes are ampliﬁed (Figure 1b) and digested in
solution to form single-stranded DNA reporter molecules
with one tag sequence at each end (Figure 1c). Upon
hybridization of the ampliﬁed molecules to arrayed
oligonucleotides, the reporter molecules are then circular-
ized by a process of on-chip ligation, followed by on-chip
rolling circle ampliﬁcation (RCA) and detection
(Figure 1d). RCA (15) has previously been demonstrated
to enable selective ampliﬁcation of reacted padlock probes
(16) and the ampliﬁcation level may be extended by intro-
ducing consecutive rounds of RCA (17). In a landmark
paper Lizardi et al. demonstrated solid-phase RCA and
enumeration of single RCA products (18).
The method enhanced the limit of detection by a factor
of 100 000 compared to direct target hybridization and
permitted measurement of less than 100 target molecules
with a linear dynamic range close to ﬁve orders of
magnitude in analyses of nucleic acid RNA expression.
We observed a dramatic reduction of cross-hybridization
on arrays compared to hybridization-based microarray
analysis, enabling detection over wide concentration
ranges. The performance of the DTM approach was
additionally illustrated by digitally counting individual
RCA products in array features for high-performance
analysis, by monitoring on-chip RCA signal accumulation
Figure 1. Schematic description of the dual-tag array procedure. (a) Probe design. Padlock probes are designed to comprise end sequences
complementary to adjacent target sequences (black), MlyI restriction digestion cassettes (gray), and 30 and 50 tag sequences ﬂanking a
general detection cassette (blue, red and green, respectively). For proximity ligation each antibody is equipped with an oligonucleotide comprising a
MlyI cassette, a tag sequence and half the detection sequence, which is also used for probe ligation. (b) The probes are ligated by target-mediated
ligation. Solution phase ampliﬁcation is performed and (c) restriction oligonucleotides are annealed to the ampliﬁcation products directing the
MlyI digestion, which creates reporter molecules with speciﬁc tag sequence elements at the 50 and 30-ends. (d) The reporter molecules are
circularized by on-chip ligation after hybridization to microarray oligonucleotides, complementary to the tag sequences at either end of the reporter
molecules. The immobilized oligonucleotides then prime on-chip RCA ampliﬁcation detected by hybridizing a ﬂuorophore-labeled detection
oligonucleotide.

in real-time, and by using the arrays for recording the
detection of a cytokine protein via proximity ligation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was prepared from the cell lines KAT-4 (19)
and MP6 (20) using the PARIS kit (Ambion Inc., Austin,
TX, USA). The mRNA was converted to cDNA using
oligo-dT primer and the Omniscript kit (Qiagen Nordic,
West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Padlock probe detection with DTM
The DTM procedure for padlock probe analyses was
conducted using the following consecutive steps:
(1) Padlock ligation reactions were performed in 10 ml
reactions, comprising 0.1 nM of each probe, 5 ml
sample and 5U of Ampligase in Ampligase buﬀer
(Epicentre Biotechnologies, WI, USA) for four cycles
of 4 h at 508C, separated by 2min at 958C.
(2) After detection probe ligation, 1 ml of 100 nM
RCAprim1 (Supplementary Data Table 2) was added
and RCA was performed at 378C for 1 h by addition of
5 ml S8 buﬀer [20mM TRIS–Ac pH 8, 50mM KAc,
10mM (NH4)2SO4, 10mM MgAc2, 1mM DTT], with
0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (New England
Biolabs, USA), 0.6mM of each dNTP and 3U phi29
DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Lithuania).
(3) RCA products were cleaved with MlyI by addition of
5 ml S8 buﬀer with 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 pmol of each of
the two restriction oligonucleotides 30MC and 50MC
(Supplementary Data Table 2), along with 5U of
MlyI (New England Biolabs, USA) for 1 h at 378C.
(4) On-chip ligation was performed by adding 30 ml
ligation mix, comprising Ampligase, buﬀer (Epicentre
Biotechnologies, WI, USA), 25 mg BSA and 5U
Ampligase and incubating at 508C over night after
addition to the microarray reaction chambers (see
Supplementary Data for details). Subsequent to
ligation on arrays, each well was gently ﬂushed
with 1ml of 0.75 TNT buﬀer at RT (110mM
NaCl, 7.5mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 0.04% Tween 20),
before the microarrays were washed and dried.
(5) Next, the circularized reporter molecules were
replicated by on-chip RCA in 50 ml phi29 buﬀer
(New England Biolabs, MA, USA), 0.5 mg/ml BSA,
0.2mM of each dNTP and 10U of phi29 polymerase
for 45min, and then the microarrays were washed
and dried.
(6) Ampliﬁcation products were visualized by hybridiz-
ing 10 nM of detection probe labeled with Cy5
(Supplementary Data Table 2) in 2 SSC (0.3M
NaCl, 30mM Na-citrate) and 0.1% SDS for at least
1 h at 508C, followed by washing and drying.
Unless otherwise stated, all microarray washes were
performed in 0.75 TNT buﬀer for 5min, rinsing in
0.1 SSC, and the slides were dried by centrifugation in
a table centrifuge. Microarrays were scanned with a
Genepix scanner (Molecular Devices Corporation, CA,
USA) at 5 mm resolution and analyzed with the Genepix
Pro 6.0 software. Data points are mean values of triplicate
array features, unless otherwise noted.
Protein detection with DTM
Tubes (AJ Roboscreen GmbH, Germany) were coated
with 1 ng/ml aﬃnity puriﬁed polyclonal antibody directed
against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA)
(R&D systems Cat. # AF-293-NA) overnight at 48C and
the oligonucleotides ProxA and ProxB (Supplementary
Data Table 2) were conjugated to two aliquots of
polyclonal antibody as previously described (21). Coating
of tubes with the same polyclonal antibody was followed
by blocking [2% BSA (w/v), 10 ng/ml PolyA and 1mM
biotin]. After sample incubation for 3 h at 378C in PBS-T
[1 PBS 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20], 1 nM of each of the two
antibody oligonucleotide conjugates were added in PBS-T
and incubated for 1 h at 378C. All steps were separated by
washing in PBS-T in a Columbus plate washer (Tecan).
Finally, a PCR and ligation mix was added [1 PCR buﬀer
(Invitrogen), 3mM MgCl2, 0.08mM ATP, 100 nM
ProxSplint oligonucleotide, 100 nM of each primer
ProxFwd and ProxRev (Supplementary Data Table 2),
1U T4 DNA ligase and 1.5U Taq DNA polymerase
Platinum (Invitrogen)]. The ProxFwd primer had a 50
phosphate, while ProvRev was blocked with a 50 biotin.
After PCR (2min 958C and 26 cycles of 15 s 958C, 1min
608C) the buﬀer was changed to lambda exonuclease buﬀer
[67mM glycine–KOH pH 9.4, 2.5mMMgCl2, 0.01% (v/v)
Triton X-100] using a G-50 gel-ﬁltration column (GE
Healthcare). Next, ssDNA was generated by addition of
lambda exonuclease, selectively destroying the strand
extended from the phosphorylated but not from the
biotinylated ampliﬁcation primer. After heat deactivation
at 808C for 15min, and a second G-50 exchange to S8
buﬀer the protocol was performed according to step 3 and
forward in the DTM protocol described earlier with the
exception of using the oligonucleotides ProxDet and
ProxTag (Supplementary Data Table 2) for detection and
array tag, respectively.
RESULTS
The DTM procedure for measuring nucleic acids and
proteins is illustrated in Figure 1. Brieﬂy, for mRNA
expression proﬁling cDNA served as targets for enzymatic
circularization of padlock probes that were then ampliﬁed
by RCA in solution. Similarly, in protein analysis
templates for array-based RCA were obtained through
proximity ligation reactions, as described later. The
ampliﬁcation products of probes having detected DNA
or protein molecules were digested to release reporter
molecules with speciﬁc tag motifs at both the 50- and
30-ends. These ampliﬁed reporter molecules exclusively
contained in silico designed sequence motifs, since the
digestion removed any target-speciﬁc sequences. Upon
hybridization of both ends of the reporter molecules
to complementary arrayed oligonucleotides, the DNA

fragments were circularized by on-chip ligation and
ampliﬁed by on-chip RCA. Finally, the on-chip RCA
products in arrays were detected by hybridization using
universal ﬂuorescence-labeled oligonucleotides. The
dependence on speciﬁc ligation of probes followed by
ampliﬁcation, ﬁrst in solution and then again on-chip,
maintains the chain of speciﬁcity from the detection of
target molecules in solution to the recording of detection
signals on the arrays.
It is well-established that DNA detection by ligation of
pairs of probe sequences can provide increased speciﬁcity
of detection compared to simple hybridization reactions
(22). To investigate the eﬀect on microarray performance
by on-chip ligation versus hybridization, nine circulariz-
able reporter molecules were used. A set of 2507 arrayed
oligonucleotide probes that could be expected to exhibit
cross-reactivity for the reporter molecules were identiﬁed
from a commercial set of 30 000 70-mer oligonucleotide
array probes by a low-stringency BLAST search (for
details see Supplementary Data). This oligonucleotide set
was used to evaluate microarray signal to noise in
experiments where the reporter molecules were either
hybridized as pre-circularized reporter molecules or
circularized by on-chip ligation, templated by the immo-
bilized oligonucleotides, followed by on-chip RCA. The
RCA products were detected using the same labeled
detection oligonucleotides in all experiments. Among the
2507 array probes, a total of 82 reproducible background
signals were recovered above the noise threshold. All 82
cross-reactions appeared in the hybridization experiment
while in the ligation experiment all features were below
the background threshold, as seen in Figure 2 (see
Supplementary Data for details). It should be pointed
out that the on-chip RCA facilitates detection of cross-
hybridization that might go undetected in conventional
hybridization arrays because of weaker detection signals.
In order for the reporter molecules from DNA or
protein detection reactions to be circularized on arrays
they must be single-stranded and have tag sequences at
both ends. We found that the type IIS restriction enzyme
MlyI was able to cleave single-stranded ampliﬁcation
products of ligated probes next to their variable tag
sequences, as long as the immediately adjacent MlyI
recognition sequences were made double-stranded
(Figure 1c and Supplementary Data Figure 1). The
eﬃciency of the MlyI cleavage at the junctions of single-
and double-stranded DNA was 81% of that obtained
by RsaI digestion of the double-stranded molecule
(Supplementary Data Figure 1), as investigated by
separating radiolabeled molecules by PAGE gel electro-
phoresis (data not shown).
To benchmark the complete protocol we ﬁrst investi-
gated how the limit of detection was aﬀected by the two
sequential RCA steps, comparing the relative intensity of
signals when; (i) pre-circularized reporter molecules
hybridized to array features were directly detected by
sandwich hybridization of ﬂuorescence-labeled oligonu-
cleotides without any ampliﬁcation (Figure 3, no RCA),
(ii) pre-circularized reporter molecules were detected by
on-chip RCA (Figure 3, on-chip RCA) and (iii) using the
complete procedure where circularized padlock probes
were ﬁrst ampliﬁed by RCA in solution, followed by
restriction digestion, on-chip ligation and a second round
of RCA (Figure 3, solution and on-chip RCA). The results
show that around 100-fold lower concentrations of cir-
cularized padlock probes could be detected using on-chip
RCA, compared to direct detection of the pre-circularized
reporter molecules without ampliﬁcation. By combining a
ﬁrst solution-phase RCA with a secondary on-chip RCA,
approximately 105-fold lower concentrations of target
strands could be detected compared to the detection of
the circular DNA strands by sandwich hybridization with a

detection oligonucleotide—a situation similar to that of
standard hybridization microarrays.
For a practical demonstration of the DTM procedure
we compared the detection of beta actin transcripts in
dilutions of total cellular cDNA, using either padlock
probes with DTM or traditional quantitative real-time
PCR analysis of the same cDNA dilutions (Figure 4).
With the DTM approach the beta actin transcript could
be detected over a linear dynamic range close to 105 and a
limit of detection of 1.6 pg total mRNA corresponding to
as little as 10 aM or 30 copies in 5 ml of the beta actin
transcript. The limit of detection, two standard deviations
above background, of the DTM procedure was calculated
by scanning the microarray at higher photomultiplier tube
gain to determine the standard deviation of the back-
ground signal (see Supplementary Data Figure 2). The
combination of padlock probes and DTM thus allows
parallel mRNA measurements with performance charac-
teristics approaching those achieved in individual quanti-
tative real-time PCR analyses, where even single nucleic
acid copies can be detected and dynamic ranges of up to
107–108 are possible.
The ability of the DTM platform to resolve small copy
number diﬀerences was investigated in a dual-color
experiment, in a manner similar to comparisons between
gene expression in healthy and diseased tissue samples.
One set of samples contained a constant amount of total
cDNA (A), and these were compared to a second set of
samples (B) with a series of 1.8-fold dilutions of the same
cDNA sample. For this purpose two padlock probes with
identical target-complementary sequences but diﬀerent
detection tags were used for the A and B samples,
respectively. One padlock probe, whose ampliﬁcation
products on the arrays were detected with probes labeled
with the ﬂuorophore TAMRA, was used for target
detection in the samples with a ﬁxed concentration (A).
The other padlock probe, reporting in Cy5, was applied
for target detection in the dilution series (B), in a series of
separate ligation reactions. The A and B ligation reactions
were subsequently pooled pair-wise, forming a single
series where the ratios of the two types of reacted padlock
probes with separate detection backbones reﬂect the target
ratios in the pooled pairs of samples. The reactions were
subsequently detected with DTM as outlined in Figure 1,
using one TAMRA and one Cy5 labeled detection
oligonucleotide for detection of RCA products, thereby
reporting the target ratio in each microarray feature (see
Supplementary Data Figure 3 for an illustration of the
experimental procedure). The measured ratios of ﬂuores-
cence from samples with greater than 1.5-fold diﬀerences
in copy numbers diﬀered by more than two standard
deviations, permitting precise copy number measurement
(Figure 5).
To investigate the generality and reproducibility of the
DTM read-out, 10 padlock probes were designed to detect
four transcripts, and their expression levels were analyzed
in cDNA prepared from the KAT4 cell line. The
correlation of two independent experiments showed a
linear regression of 0.9766, demonstrating good reprodu-
cibility (Figure 6). Furthermore, the KAT4 cell line,

transcripts are plotted against each other to demonstrate
reproducibility.

known to express high levels of transcripts for platelet-
derived growth factor A (PDGFA) (19), was compared to
the MP6 cell line by analyzing the summed signals of the
two PDGFA probes, revealing that the MP6 cell line
expressed 50-fold lower levels of PDGFA transcripts
compared to the KAT4 cells (Figure 7).
We next monitored the on-chip RCA in real-time using
a confocal microarray scanner. A molecular beacon probe
(23), modiﬁed for detection of RCA products (24) (see
Supplementary Data Table 2), was used to follow the
accumulation of RCA products on microarrays during
replication. For this experiment, variable amounts of
oligonucleotide probes were deposited on a microarray,
and an excess of pre-circularized reporter molecules was
allowed to hybridize to the immobilized primers, and
washed before initiating the on-chip RCA. Figure 8
demonstrates that the on-chip RCA from oligonucleotides
printed on the array at four diﬀerent concentrations
resulted in a linear accumulation of ﬂuorescence for
up to 60min, and that higher primer concentrations
resulted in proportionately higher ﬂuorescence from the
array features. A movie illustrating the progress of signal
increase in this experiment can be found in Supplementary
Data.
Single-molecule detection can provide improved quanti-
tative precision. To investigate the suitability of the DTM
platform for single-molecule analysis of reporter molecules
on arrays we enumerated individual ampliﬁcation products
within individual array features as a measure of two
diﬀerent oligonucleotide sequences detected by separate
padlock probes. The probe pair, designed to discriminate
a single-nucleotide variation (G/T), was added to samples
containing two synthetic target sequences at diﬀerent pro-
portions, followed by probe ligation. The ligated padlock
probes were then hybridized to array features containing
an oligonucleotide complementary to a common sequence
element. On-chip RCA was initiated from the array, and
the two classes of ampliﬁcation products were detected by
hybridization of two detection oligonucleotides labeled
with distinct ﬂuorophores. The Cy3-labeled detection
probe D3 reported the G-variant of the target sequence,
while the Cy5-labeled detection probe D5 reported the
T-variant. Images from individual microarray spots
were recorded using confocal microscopy, followed by
image analysis and automated counting of ﬂuorescent
spots using aMatlab script. A thresholded two-color image
of a microarray feature is shown in Figure 9a. The
measured ratios of discrete single-molecule counts from
the two probes observed in individual array features were
plotted against the ratios of the two added sequence
variants, demonstrating excellent correlation. The linear
regression value of the plots was 0.9935, and the average
deviation from the mean ratio of the data points was 2%
(Figure 9b).
Finally, the DTM platform could also be useful for
recording the detection of proteins in multiplex. To
investigate the feasibility of this we applied the DTM to
monitor the outcome of solid-phase proximity ligation
assays for protein detection (Figure 1) (25). Two
oligonucleotides, one having a free 30-end and the other
a free 50-end, were conjugated to separate aliquots of a
polyclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGFA). Each oligonucleotide included
a tag sequence and a PCR primer site, also encompassing
the MlyI cleavage cassette. Following capture of the
VEGFA target protein in microtiter wells by an immobi-
lized antibody and washing, the pair of conjugates was
added. Binding by appropriate pairs of antibody-oligonu-
cleotide conjugates to individual VEGFA molecules per-
mitted ligation of the attached oligonucleotides that were
thus brought in proximity. The probe ligation products,
comprising both tag sequences, were then selectively ampli-
ﬁed by PCR. One of the PCR primers was phosphorylated,
permitting degradation of the corresponding strand by
lambda exonuclease (26), while the other strand was
protected by a 50 biotin moiety. The single-stranded
product was cleaved by addition of restriction oligonucleo-
tides and MlyI, leaving a reporter molecule with tags at
both the 30- and 50-ends. The reporter molecules were
circularized by on-chip ligation after hybridization to the
tag microarray, ampliﬁed by RCA, and visualized by
detection probe decoration. As seen in Figure 10, this
on-chip analysis of products of proximity ligation reac-
tions enabled detection of low picomolar concentrations of
recombinant VEGFA protein in a format suitable for

DISCUSSION
Microarrays provide eﬃcient measurement of gene
expression, as conﬁrmed by recent reports where micro-
array platforms were validated using real-time PCR
(27,28). However, there is need for improvements of e.g.
false negative rates, and the dynamic range in microarray
analyses is typically limited to 3 logs (27,29,30) even
though RNA expression in homogenous cell populations
span over six orders of magnitude (12). Cross-hybridiza-
tion that amount to less than 1–10% of the hybridization
signal from the intended microarray feature is often
considered insigniﬁcant (13,31–33). Nonetheless, this
level may well contribute to frequent reports of poor
correlation between weak microarray signals and real-time
PCR measurements of transcript levels (30,34).
Padlock probes are capable of distinguishing even single
base-pair diﬀerences in total human genomic DNA, and
their ability to be combined in large numbers in individual
reactions has proven useful for parallel SNP genotyping,
measurements of gene expression, and for detection of
sets of pathogens (6,35,36). The speciﬁcity introduced by
ligation is well-documented (22). However, after target
detection by ligation, ampliﬁcation products of reacted
probes are typically sorted on microarrays by hybridiza-
tion, a step where speciﬁcity may be lost due to cross-
hybridization to incorrect array features. Herein we
present a protocol in which also microarray sorting of
ampliﬁed detection probes was achieved via ligation,
and we demonstrate that this signiﬁcantly reduced the risk
of cross-hybridization, and greatly improved detection
sensitivity.
The DTM platform presented herein will allow highly
speciﬁc measurements of large sets of biomolecules with a
very low limit of detection, wide dynamic range and high
precision. Non-speciﬁc background is minimized by using
highly speciﬁc probing steps, and by ensuring that
detection signals are exclusively dependent on probe
ligation reactions. A ﬁrst solution-phase ampliﬁcation of
ligated detection probes serves to enhance the kinetics of
the subsequent array hybridization, and ampliﬁed reporter
molecules are sorted with excellent speciﬁcity via paired
sequence recognition and on-chip ligation, followed by a
second ampliﬁcation step on the array. Using the DTM
for recording beta actin gene expression, we successfully
detected less than 100 transcripts, and with a dynamic
range of almost ﬁve orders of magnitude, in a protocol
suitable for parallel detection of very large sets of ampli-
ﬁed probes. By allowing the use of arrayed oligo-
nucleotides to template ligation of reporter molecules,
the limit of detection by on-chip RCA could be enhanced

without a concomitant increase of non-speciﬁc back-
ground. The improved speciﬁcity obtained by on-chip
ligation was demonstrated by comparing the background
signals generated by nine reporter molecules in array-
based ligation or hybridization. The requirement for liga-
tion eliminated all background signals recorded among
the 2507 investigated array probes present in the corresp-
onding hybridization-based experiment. The single- and
dual-color expression proﬁling experiments demonstrated
that the DTM approach is applicable for measuring target
molecules with high precision and reproducibility. Analo-
gously, for protein measurement by proximity ligation,
reacted probes were ampliﬁed by PCR prior to array-
based on-chip ligation and RCA, enabling detection of
VEGFA in the low picomolar range, and in a manner
suitable for multiplex protein analyses.
The opportunity to perform single-molecule quantiﬁca-
tion in individual array features can confer advantages
over conventional measurements of ensemble averages.
By counting discrete reporter molecules as individual,
easily detectable RCA products, analytic variation can be
brought to the statistical minimum deﬁned by the Poisson
distribution of numbers of molecules (37). On-chip RCA
of single, speciﬁcally reacted probes as used herein avoids
problems of distinguishing weak ﬂuorescent signals from
background and it ensures highly speciﬁc target detection,
in contrast to other single-molecule detection approaches
that rely on simple probe-binding reactions and detection
of very few ﬂuorophores over any background arising
from media or nonspeciﬁcally bound probes.
In conclusion, we have shown that the DTM procedure
can be used to record reacted probes that report the
amounts of speciﬁc nucleic acids or proteins, with
excellent performance. The procedure should also be
useful to identify interacting protein pairs among large
sets of proteins recognized by antibodies with attached
DNA strands, by decoding which pairs of tag sequences
that have become joined in the proximity ligation products
using DTMs. The DTM platform thus presents an
attractive alternative for advanced microarray analysis
by enhancing the limit of detection and dynamic range,
eliminating cross-hybridization, and by providing a means
to measure individual or interacting proteins on DNA
microarrays.
