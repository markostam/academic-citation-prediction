ABSTRACT
Recent transcription profiling studies have revealed
an unanticipatedly large proportion of antisense
transcription across eukaryotic and bacterial
genomes. However, the extent and significance of
antisense transcripts is controversial partly because
experimental artifacts are suspected. Here, we
present a method to generate clean genome-wide
transcriptome profiles, using actinomycin D (ActD)
during reverse transcription. We show that anti-
sense artifacts appear to be triggered by spurious
synthesis of second-strand cDNA during reverse
transcription reactions. Strand-specific hybridi-
zation signals obtained from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae tiling arrays were compared between
samples prepared with and without ActD. Use of
ActD removed about half of the detectable anti-
sense transcripts, consistent with their being arti-
facts, while sense expression levels and about
200 antisense transcripts were not affected.
Our findings thus facilitate a more accurate assess-
ment of the extent and position of antisense
transcription, towards a better understanding of
its role in cells.
INTRODUCTION
Non-protein-coding RNAs are postulated to represent
an important development in the genetic operating system
of higher eukaryotes, where the ratio of non-coding
to protein-coding DNA rises as a function of phenotypic
complexity (1). Among them, antisense transcripts
have been implicated in transcription, processing, stabi-
lity, transport and translation of their corresponding
complementary RNAs (2,3). Their role appears to be
regulatory (4) and has been implicated in human genetic
diseases (5).
Ongoing large-scale studies using cDNA sequencing
and genome tiling arrays have reported a widespread
occurrence of antisense transcripts in the genomes
of simple organisms (6–9), as well as higher eukaryotes
(10–12). The unexpected extent of antisense transcription
over the genomes, as well as the observation of mirrored
transcription for several sense–antisense pairs have raised
the concern that some of these signals can be due to
experimental artifacts (13). However, these concerns have
remained speculative and no comprehensive independent
experimental validation has been performed yet.
One possibility is that artifacts arise during target
preparation by reverse transcription, confounding the
interpretation of array data when both genomic strands
are interrogated (Figure 1). Indeed, reverse transcriptase
has a tendency to generate spurious second-strand cDNA
based on its DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity
(14). Among several possibilities, priming of ﬁrst-strand
cDNA could occur by either a hairpin loop at its 30 end or
by re-priming, from either RNA fragments formed by
degradation of RNA templates or from primers used for
the ﬁrst-strand synthesis (15,16).
ActD is a known inhibitor of transcription, as well as
DNA replication. Less well known is the fact that ActD
can also selectively prevent second-strand cDNA synthesis
during reverse transcription (17) due to the speciﬁc
inhibition of DNA-dependent, but not RNA-dependent,
DNA-synthesis (18) (Figure 1). This inhibitory eﬀect
of ActD appears related to its ability to bind deoxygua-
nosine residues on single- and double-stranded DNA,
possibly preventing either the annealing of DNA during
priming or the elongation of DNA-dependent DNA-
synthesis (19).
Here we show that a standard reverse transcription
reaction, used for the synthesis of DNA complementary to
RNA templates, is a major source of artifactual antisense
transcripts. We demonstrate this using an array that
contains 6.5 million probes tiling both strands of the full
genomic sequence of S. cerevisiae at an average of 8 nt
intervals on each strand and a 4 nt oﬀset of the tile
between strands (7). We propose that ActD can be used
in cDNA preparations during reverse transcription reac-
tions for hybridization to microarrays, to generate clean
transcriptome proﬁles. We show that antisense artifacts

These ﬁndings have implications for other genome-wide
approaches involving reverse transcription.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample preparation
S1003 (MATa/a gal2/gal2 lys5/lys5), an S288c back-
ground strain, was grown in 100mL of rich medium
(2% Difco peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% dextrose) to
mid-exponential phase (OD600 1.0). Total RNA was
isolated by a standard hot phenol method. Poly(A) RNA
was isolated from 1mg of total RNA by using the
Oligotex mRNA Midi kit (Qiagen). Each sample of
poly(A) RNA was treated with RNase-free DNaseI
using Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). For ﬁrst-strand
cDNA synthesis, 9 mg of poly(A) RNA was mixed with
4.5mg of random hexamers and incubated at 708C for
10min, then transferred on ice. The synthesis included
2000 U of SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase, 50mM
Tris–HCl, 75mM KCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.01M DTT,
0.25mM dNTPs mix (Invitrogen) in a total volume of
200ml at 428C for 1 h. Samples prepared with ActD were
treated the same, except that the drug was added after the
denaturing step at 708C to a ﬁnal concentration of
6 mg/ml. Samples were then subjected to RNase treatment
of 20min at 378C (30 U RNase H, Epicentre, 60 U of
RNase Cocktail, Ambion). First-strand cDNA was
puriﬁed by standard phenol extraction (1.5 ml Phase
lock gel, Eppendorf) and ethanol precipitation.
The sample was dissolved in DEPC water and digested
by using 0.1 U DNase I (Invitrogen) in 1 One-Phor-All
buﬀer (Amersham Pharmacia) and 1.5mM CoCl2 (Roche)
solution at 378C, to yield fragments of 50–100 bp in size.
Each sample was 30 end-labeled with 0.07mM Biotin-
N6-ddATP (Enzo Life Sciences) using 400 U of Terminal
Transferase (Roche) for 2 h at 378C.
For genomic DNA hybridizations, the diploid yeast
strain (S1003) was grown in rich media to saturation and
genomic DNA was puriﬁed by using the Genomic tip
protocol (Genomic DNA kit, Qiagen) including RNase A
treatment. 10 mg of DNA was fragmented with 0.2 U of
DNaseI (Invitrogen) for 5min at 378C and labeled as
described for cDNA.
Hybridization to arrays
For genomic DNA and cDNA from poly(A)-RNA,
labeled samples of 10 and 4.5mg respectively were
denatured in a solution containing 100mM Mes, 1M
[Na+], 20mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20, 50 pM control
oligonucleotide B2 (Aﬀymetrix), 0.1mg/ml herring
sperm DNA, and 0.5mg/ml BSA in a total volume of
300ml, from which 220 ml were hybridized per array.
Hybridizations were carried out at 458C for 16 h with
60 r.p.m. rotation. Our analysis is based on ﬁve replicate
sample hybridizations of poly(A) RNA without ActD,
three replicate sample hybridizations of poly(A) RNA
with ActD and three of genomic DNA.
Data preprocessing
Arrays were normalized using the DNA reference normal-
ization (20) as implemented in the tiling array package of
Bioconductor (21). Only the probes that are unique and
exactly match to the S288c genome were further con-
sidered. All arrays were then segmented together using the
segmentation algorithm (20) as implemented in the tiling
array package of Bioconductor.
Calculation of background threshold
To estimate a common background threshold for both
ORFs and segment comparisons, we used the segments
that do not overlap with any annotated, transcribed
features. Only data from the hybridizations without ActD
were used to determine the background threshold.
The values of the segments were ﬁrst sorted and the
midpoint of the shorth (the shortest interval that covers
half of the values) of the ﬁrst 99.9% of the data was used
to ﬁt a normal distribution to determine the threshold at
which the false discovery rate is 0.1%, as performed in
David et al. (7). This estimated background threshold was
used to rescale the probe intensity data, setting the
background threshold to zero for all probes.
Calculation of sense and antisense strand signals for ORFs
To compare the signal for both sense and antisense
strands of ORFs between hybridizations performed with
and without ActD, the probes were mapped to the anno-
tated features (davidTiling Package in Bioconductor, gﬀ
data) and the same boundaries opposite to the annotated
features. The signals of the probes were then averaged
among the replicates and the median value of all the
probes that mapped to the feature was used to represent
the signal of that feature. An ORF or its antisense region
was considered as transcribed if the expression signal was
above 0 (Supplementary Table 1).
Categorization of segments
After segmentation, the probe signals within the bound-
aries of the segments were averaged among replicates and
the median value of the averages was used to represent the
expression signal of the segment. Segments were then
assigned to diﬀerent categories depending on how they
overlapped with annotated features, as described in David
et al. (7). The segments in reaction with and without ActD
were categorized separately and classiﬁed as annotated
ORF, annotated ncRNA, novel isolated, novel antisense,
excluded, dubious gene. The excluded segments were the
segments that have more than 50% non-unique probes.
The novel isolated segments were the segments that do not
overlap with any transcribed features on either strand.
The novel antisense ﬁltered segments are the segments that
do not overlap with any transcribed features but overlap
with a transcribed feature on the opposite strand.
Antisense and isolated segments had to further fulﬁll the
following two criteria: (i) have a length longer than 48 bp
and (ii) be ﬂanked by segments with reduced signal on
both sides. If not fulﬁlling both criteria, they were
e128 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 19 PAGE 2 OF 7
classiﬁed as unassigned antisense or unassigned isolated,
respectively (Supplementary Table 2).
Comparison to cDNA sequencing
We compared the stringent set of antisense detected by
cDNA sequencing of strain S288c (8) to our data.
Comparisons were based on gene names of the sense
transcripts. Of 7562 features (e.g. genes) (davidTiling
Package in Bioconductor, gﬀ data), 218 features show
antisense sequences by cDNA sequencing, 229 features
have antisense segments in data generated with the
addition of ActD, and 589 features have antisense
segments in data generated in the absence of ActD. We
found 26 features in common between the cDNA
sequencing dataset and the ActD+ array dataset, and
36 features in common with the ActD array dataset. A
Fisher’s exact test was performed on the numbers above.
Comparison to computational filtering
The antisense segments were ﬂagged by the ﬁlter if any
median signal of a 100 bp sliding region on the opposite
strand of the antisense segment was larger than the signal
of the antisense segment itself, as applied previously (7).
Two comparisons were performed between the two
datasets (with and without ActD). In a ﬁrst comparison
the ﬁlter was applied to both datasets generated with and
without ActD. In a second comparison the dataset on
antisense segments detected in the presence of ActD was
compared with the dataset on antisense segments detected
in the absence of ActD but after ﬁltering. The diﬀerences
were manually checked. A list of these segments is
available in Supplementary Table 4 and the expres-
sion proﬁles are available online on our website (www.
ebi.ac.uk/huber-srv/actinomycinD).
Strand-specific RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from strain S1003 (MATa/a gal2/
gal2 lys5/lys5) as described above and was treated with
RNase-free DNase I (TURBO DNase, Ambion) for
25min at 378C. DNA-free RNA samples were split into
+RT and RT reactions. In +RT reactions, three
replicates for each antisense RNA were performed in the
presence of reverse transcriptase. In each reaction 2 pmol
of primer, designed to hybridize to the antisense transcript
(Supplementary Table 5), was added and annealed to 2 mg
of total RNA by 5min incubation at 658C, followed by
cooling on ice. A strand-speciﬁc primer targeting ACT1
mRNA was always included as an internal control.
First-strand cDNA was synthesized by using 200 U of
SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) for 50min at 428C. The
enzyme was heat inactivated at 708C for 15min. RNA
complementary to the cDNA was removed by Escherichia
coli RNase H (10 U, Epicentre) and remaining RNAs
were digested with 20 U of RNase Cocktail (Ambion).
The RT reactions were treated identically to the +RT
reactions, with the exception that reverse transcriptase
was omitted.
PCR was performed for the antisense transcripts of
interest and for ACT1 individually by using 1 ml of the RT
reaction as a template, two gene speciﬁc primers (250 nM
each) (Supplementary Table 5), 200 mM dNTP and 1 U of
Ampli Taq Gold (Applied Biosystems). As a positive
control PCR reactions were performed with genomic
DNA as a template. The following thermal proﬁle was
used for ampliﬁcation: incubation at 958C for 10min
followed by 25 cycles of three-step ampliﬁcation at 958C
for 30 s, 608C or 528C (dependent on primer) for 30 s and
728C for 30 s.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To assess the extent of artifacts generated by reverse
transcription, we performed ﬁve replicates (biological) of
standard reverse transcription reactions lacking ActD
(ActD) on RNA samples from yeast grown in rich media
and analyzed cDNA targets by hybridization to tiling
arrays. For sense transcripts, hybridization signals were
concordant between all replicates. However, two types of
signals were registered on the antisense strands opposite to
expressed genomic regions. In one class, the signal
intensities corresponded proportionally to the intensities
of the sense counterparts (Figure 2A, upper panel);
furthermore, substantial variability existed across repli-
cates (Figure 2B and C, upper panel). In the other class,
antisense signals were highly reproducible across all
replicates and did not correlate with sense strand
expression levels (Figure 2D, upper panel). These diﬀer-
ences suggested that the ﬁrst class of antisense signals
might be artifacts, potentially triggered by spurious
second-strand synthesis during reverse transcription as
proposed by the models (Figure 1). Besides growth in rich
media, we have seen the same pattern for several other
conditions (data not shown). We postulated that the
putative artifacts can be resolved using ActD. Indeed,
three replicates of reverse transcription reactions per-
formed with ActD (ActD+) resulted in expression signals
below background for the ﬁrst class, but not for the
second class of antisense regions (Figure 2A–D,
lower panels). In addition to the examples shown
in Figure 2, proﬁles for all genomic regions are available
online (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/huber-srv/actinomycinD).
A genome-wide comparison of expression signals with
or without ActD over all coding genes [as deﬁned by
ORFs in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD,
http://www.yeastgenome.org)] and their opposite regions
supported the interpretation that ActD reduces artifactual
antisense signals. The number of antisense regions
detected as expressed above background declined from
1046 in ActD to 325 in ActD+. Moreover, only 25%
(260/1046) of the cases observed upon standard ﬁrst-
strand cDNA synthesis are still detectable in ActD+
(Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, consistent with
its speciﬁc role in second-strand synthesis, ActD did
not aﬀect the number of sense transcripts detected
above background. Out of 5703 coding-genes (ORFs),
the majority is expressed above background in both
conditions: 5214 ORFs in ActD+ and 5186 ORFs in
ActD; in addition, there is a nearly complete overlap
between the two gene lists (5172 ORFs) (Supplementary
Table 1).

Tiling arrays can be used for de novo identiﬁcation of
transcripts (7). Therefore, the hybridization signals of
probes were examined along their chromosomal positions
irrespective of previous annotation and separately for each
strand. The proﬁles were partitioned into segments of
constant hybridization intensity using a segmentation
algorithm (7,20). We analyzed the eﬀect of ActD for
sense and antisense transcripts deﬁned by segmentation
(Supplementary Table 2). Antisense segments were deﬁned
based on three criteria: (i) the segments are expressed and
overlap annotated genes located on the opposite strand,
but not on the same strand, (ii) the segment lengths are
longer than 48 bp and (iii) they are ﬂanked by segments
with reduced hybridization signal on both sides.
A comparison shows that ActD has no quantitative eﬀect
on ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis, since there is concordance
between the expression levels of sense segments measured
in ActD+ and ActD reactions (Figure 3). However,
the addition of ActD reduces the expression level below
background for more than half of the antisense segments:
among a total of 553 antisense segments, 347 give signal
above background only in ActD and 14 only in ActD+,
while 192 antisense segments are detected in both
conditions (Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, strikingly,
the number of antisense segments observed by using a
standard reverse transcription protocol is decreased by
64% (347/539) with the inclusion of ActD.
Three independent lines of evidence are in agreement
with the array hybridization results generated in the
presence of ActD. First, we compared our array hybridi-
zation data to the stringent set of antisense transcripts
obtained by full-length cDNAs sequencing (8). Despite
complementarities between these two methods, as well as
the comparison being between diﬀerent experimental
growth conditions (rich media versus minimal media), a
better overlap was achieved for the ActD+ than the
ActD dataset (P value of 1.6e9 versus 2.5e6, Fisher’s
exact test). Second, we evaluated the eﬀect of a stringent
computational ﬁlter on removing putative antisense
artifacts from hybridization results. This ﬁlter was
previously developed to computationally remove putative
antisense artifacts by requiring segments to have higher
expression signal than seen on the opposite strand for at
least part of their length (7). On ActD data, the
computational ﬁlter reduced the number of antisense
segments by 63% (337/539). In contrast, the ﬁlter had only

Figure 1. Hypothetical models for spurious second-strand synthesis by reverse transcription (upper panel) and the mode of inhibition by ActD (lower
panel). During sample processing ﬁrst-strand cDNA is generated from RNA molecules by reverse transcription. Spurious second-strand cDNA
synthesis could occur using the ﬁrst-strand cDNA as a template. Two possible mechanisms are: self-priming through hairpin loop extension of the
ﬁrst-strand cDNA, or re-priming either from RNA fragments formed during degradation of the RNA templates or from primers present in the
reaction. In both cases, hybridization to strand-speciﬁc arrays would lead to artifactual antisense signals. ActD inhibits second-strand synthesis
(lower panel, red cross), putatively by binding to bases of single-stranded DNA molecules, and therefore artifactual antisense-strand signals would
not be detected.

a mild eﬀect on the number of antisense segments detected
in ActD+: of 206 antisense segments, only 39 were ﬁltered
out. In addition, a comparison of antisense segments
detected in ActD after ﬁltering, and antisense segments
detected in ActD+, shows good (but imperfect) con-
cordance (158/250) (Supplementary Table 4). Since
computational ﬁlters always face the dilemma of compro-
mising between false positives and false negatives, the
experimental improvement using ActD is more advanta-
geous. This is clearly the case for antisense detection as the
majority of antisense transcripts are weakly expressed
(Supplementary Table 3) and thus hard to distinguish
from noise. Notably, several antisense segments ﬁltered
out in ActD (48 segments, Figure 4A orange dots) are
detectable in ActD+, which suggests that these cases were
erroneously ﬁltered (manual inspection conﬁrms this).
In addition, ActD+ also resolves artifactual antisense
segments that erroneously passed the computational ﬁlter
(44 segments, Figure 4A green dots). Third, we conducted
semi-quantitative strand-speciﬁc RT-PCR analysis for
10 antisense segments (Figure 4B): of the three antisense
transcripts detected both in ActD+ and ActD (MBR1,
EPL1,MRK1), all three yielded a signal by strand-speciﬁc
RT-PCR. In contrast, of seven antisense segments
detected exclusively in ActD (CYS4, EMP24, PNC1,
MDH3, HAC1, TRR1, PFK1), all seven yielded negative
results by strand-speciﬁc RT-PCR.

CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that about half of all antisense signals
observed in yeast by conventional protocols hybridizing
ﬁrst-strand cDNA to high-density tiling arrays are
experimental artifacts. These artifacts appear to be largely
triggered by spurious synthesis of second-strand cDNAs
during reverse transcription reactions. Although the
inhibitory eﬀect of ActD on spurious second-strand
synthesis during reverse transcription has been known
for over 30 years (17), its application to microarray cDNA
hybridization has been largely overlooked. Recent tech-
nological advancements in microarray design have
allowed proﬁling transcription at the level of strand-
speciﬁcity, but when conventional protocols for cDNA
generation were used, the data analysis required stringent
computational ﬁltering to reduce the artifacts (7). The
development of more sensitive and high resolution
technologies needs to be complemented by the develop-
ment of more accurate protocol designs.
We ﬁnd that ActD enables a substantial experimental
improvement to resolve the artifacts early during genera-
tion of the raw data. Although the precise molecular
mechanism of this inhibition still awaits further elucida-
tion, ActD likely acts through exerting an inhibitory eﬀect
on double-stranded DNA synthesis. Its inclusion in
reverse transcription reactions increases both the sensitiv-
ity and the accuracy of array-detected antisense signals.
Thus, we encourage the use of ActD when strand-speciﬁc
transcription is interrogated by microarrays.
As reverse transcription is used in technologies beyond
array hybridization, the use of ActD has broader
applications. While widespread antisense transcription
remains detectable in the yeast genome, the extent and
identity of this transcription over the genomes of several
other organisms might be reconsidered in light of these
ﬁndings.
