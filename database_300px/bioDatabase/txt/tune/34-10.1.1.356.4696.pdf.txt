ABSTRACT
REBASE is a comprehensive database of informa-
tion about restriction enzymes, DNA methyl-
transferases and related proteins involved in the
biological process of restriction–modification
(R–M). It contains fully referenced information
about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschi-
zomers, neoschizomers, commercial availability,
methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data.
Experimentally characterized homing endonucle-
ases are also included. The fastest growing
segment of REBASE contains the putative R–M
systems found in the sequence databases.
Comprehensive descriptions of the R–M content of
all fully sequenced genomes are available including
summary schematics. The contents of REBASE may
be browsed from the web (http://rebase.neb.com)
and selected compilations can be downloaded by
ftp (ftp.neb.com). Additionally, monthly updates
can be requested via email.
OVERVIEW
The previous description of REBASE in the 2007 NAR
Database Issue (1) described 3805 biochemically or genet-
ically characterized restriction–modiﬁcation (R–M)
systems and included an analysis of approximately 400
bacterial and archaeal genomes that had been deposited
in the RefSeq Database of GenBank (2,3). Analysis of the
available sequence information in GenBank led to the pre-
diction of 2709 restriction enzyme (R) genes and 4485
DNA methyltransferase (M) genes. These numbers have
now risen to 4990 R genes and 8080 M genes of which
3511 R and 5497 M genes have arisen from the 1050
completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes.
These putative R–M system genes are given systematic
names according to the agreed upon nomenclature rules
(4). The names all carry the suﬃx ‘P’ to indicate their
putative status. In many cases, the recognition speciﬁcity
of these systems can be assigned with some degree of
conﬁdence because of their similarity to biochemically
well-characterized enzymes.
The REBASE web site (http://rebase.neb.com)
summarizes all information known about every restriction
enzyme and any associated proteins. This includes the rec-
ognition sequences, cleavage sites, source, commercial
availability, sequence data, crystal structure information,
isoschizomers and methylation sensitivity. Within the
reference section of REBASE, links are maintained to
the full text of all papers whenever they are readily avail-
able on the web. Also, there is extensive reciprocal cross-
referencing between REBASE and NCBI, including links
to GenBank and PubMed and NCBI’s LinkOut utility.
Links to other major databases such as UniProt (5),
PDB (6) and Pfam (7) are also maintained. There are
currently 3945 biochemically or genetically characterized
restriction enzymes in REBASE and of the 3834 Type II
restriction enzymes, 299 distinct speciﬁcities are known.
Six hundred and forty one restriction enzymes are com-
mercially available, including 235 distinct speciﬁcities.
As shown in Figure 1, the rate of discovery of new
putative restriction and modiﬁcation genes is rising
rapidly. In contrast, the rate at which candidates are
being characterized biochemically has actually dropped
to the level it was three decades ago. Nevertheless,
because of the large number of sequenced examples of
biochemically characterized restriction systems, the
putative recognition sequences of predicted restriction
enzymes and DNA methyltransferases can be inferred.
Currently, all new sequences entering GenBank are
checked using data mining techniques for the presence
of R–M systems and, following extensive manual
checking, the resulting inferences are all included within
REBASE where they are clearly marked as predictions.
When analyzing DNA sequence data, it is the DNA
methyltransferase genes that are the more reliable
indicators of an R–M system and the presence, proper
order and characteristic spacing of well-conserved motifs
that are used to suggest likely candidates.
It should be noted that at the present time it is not
possible to distinguish DNA methyltransferases reliably
enough to be completely conﬁdent in the assignments.

Some RNA and protein methyltransferases can sometimes
be confused for DNA methyltransferases as is widely
reﬂected by the annotations found in GenBank ﬁles.
In general, REBASE takes a liberal approach and
includes all likely candidates until it becomes clear that
non-DNA methyltransferases have been included
erroneously and then these are culled from the database.
The more widely divergent genes that encode the restric-
tion enzymes always reside close to the genes for their
cognate methyltransferases, but often they cannot be
recognized directly because they are a rapidly evolving
set of genes and frequently lack any sequence similarity
to any other genes in GenBank. However, other methods
can sometimes be used to infer their presence such as the
analysis of shotgun sequence data from which missing
clones can be inferred to be caused by the presence of
active restriction enzyme genes (8).
Given the wealth of experimental data, both published
and unpublished, contained within REBASE, it can be
an especially valuable resource during the annotation of
bacterial and archaeal genomes. With the plethora of
restriction systems that occur in all sequenced microbial
genomes, annotators are encouraged to use the resources
of the REBASE database or to contact the REBASE staﬀ
if help is needed. Custom analyses of unpublished genome
sequence data are carried out upon request.
From the REBASE web site users have a variety of
resources available that facilitate the analysis of
sequence information including tools for analyzing
sequences (REBASE tools) that allow restriction enzyme
recognition sites to be found in submitted sequences
(NEBcutter) and an implementation of BLAST to allow
searching against all sequences in REBASE. Specialty lists
of sequence data (REBASE lists) such as all known Type
II restriction enzyme genes, all known Type I speciﬁcity
subunit genes, etc., are available for download.
The coming year will see some major additions to
REBASE in terms of new sequence acquisitions, such as
the inclusion of all metagenomic sequence data (only par-
tially analyzed to date) and a tool to permit users to
perform their own analysis of newly sequenced genomes.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Special thanks are due to the many individuals who have
so kindly contributed their unpublished results for
Figure 1. The graph shows the numbers of R–M systems entering REBASE since its inception in 1975. The open bars show systems that have been
characterized either biochemically or genetically. The black bars show the increasing accumulation of potential R–M systems that have been found
by bioinformatic analysis of sequences in GenBank. The surge in 2004 represents the addition of metagenomic sequences from the Sargasso Sea
collecting expedition (9).
