Monodromy and isotopy of monotone
Lagrangian tori
Mei-Lin Yau ∗
Abstract
We define new Hamiltonian isotopy invariants for a 2-dimensional
monotone Lagrangian torus embedded in a symplectic 4-manifold. We
show that, in the standard symplectic R4, these invariants distinguish a
monotone Clifford torus from a Chekanov torus.
1 Introduction
This article concerns the Hamiltonian isotopy problem of monotone Lagrangian
tori, which is a special case of the Lagrangian knot problem as formulated by
Eliashberg and Polterovich in [5]. Two Lagrangian tori L0, L1 embedded in a
symplectic 4-manifold (M,ω) are said to be Hamiltonian isotopic if there exists
a smooth isotopy of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms φt ∈ Ham(M) with compact
support, t ∈ [0, 1], φ0 = id, such that φ1(L0) = L1.
We study the monodromy group HL of the Hamiltonian self-isotopies of a
monotone Lagrangian torus L. We define two new Hamiltonian isotopy invari-
ants for L: the twist number t(L) ∈ N ∪ {0} and the spectrum s(L) ∈ N ∪ {0}
of L. The twist number t(L) is related to Dehn twists along a embedded curve
with 0 Maslov number, while the spectrum s(L) involves the Maslov number
of the primitive integral 1-eigenvectors of involutions of HL (see Definition 2.9
and Proposition 2.10).
We then apply our construction to the cases when L ⊂ R4 is either a mono-
tone Clifford torus Tb,b or a Chekanov torus T
′
0,b (called special torus in [1]) in
the standard symplectic 4-space R4. We obtain the following:
Theorem 1.1. Let b > 0. Let Hb denote the Hamiltonian monodromy group
of Tb,b, H′b the Hamiltonian monodromy group of T ′0,b. Then Hb ∼= Z2 ∼= H′b as
abstract groups and hence t(Tb,b) = 0 = t(T
′
0,b). However,
s(Tb,b) = 2, s(T
′
0,b) = 1.
Hence Tb,b and T
′
0,b are not Hamiltonian isotopic in R

Thus our approach provides a new way to distinguish Tb,b from T
′
0,b up to
Hamiltonian isotopy.
It should be pointed out that, the Hamiltonian non-isotopy between Tb,b
and T ′0,b has been proved by Chekanov [1, 2]. Chekanov gave two proofs on this
result. The first proof in [1] utilized the symplectic capacities introduced by
Ekeland and Hofer [3, 4], whilst the second proof [2] employed pseudoholomor-
phic curves with boundaries [6]. Indeed, Chekanov dealt with Clifford tori and
Chekanov tori in symplectic R2n with n ≥ 2, and completely classified such tori
in all R2n.
Comparing with Chekanov’s proofs, our approach is more algebraic in na-
ture, and seemingly simpler and more elementary. For technical simplicity, we
do not venture into higher dimensional cases here. However, we expect that,
given suitable generalization, invariants similar to t(L) and s(L) can be defined
for monotone Lagrangian tori of general dimensions. We hope to come back to
this topic later.
This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we start with some conditions
on symplectic 4-manifolds, in order for the monotonicity of a Lagrangian torus
L to be well-defined. We then proceed to define the Hamiltonian monodromy
group H of a monotone torus L and study its properties. Then follows the def-
inition of the invariants t(L), s(L). In Section 3 we determine the Hamiltonian
monodromy group as well as the values of t(L), s(L) for L = Tb,b (Lemma 3.2)
and L = T ′0,b (Lemma 3.3). We end up this note with several open questions.
2 Hamiltonian monodromy of monotone La-
grangian tori
Let L
ι→֒ M be an embedded Lagrangian torus in a symplectic 4-manifold
(M,ω). One can endow the tangent bundle of M with an almost complex
structure compatible with ω. This turns TM into a complex vector bundle of
which the Chern classes depend only on ω. From now on, unless otherwise
mentioned, we assume that M satisfies the following two conditions that (i) the
first Chern class c1(M) = c1(TM) ∈ H2(M,Z) vanishes and (ii) H1(M,R) = 0.
That c1(M) = 0 ensures that the Maslov class µ ∈ H1(L,Z) is well-defined.
There is a unique integer mL ≥ 0 such that µ(H1(L,Z)) = mLZ. We call mL
the divisibility of µ on L.
Near L the symplectic form ω is exact, i.e., there exits a 1-form λ defined on
a tubular neighborhood UL of L oh which ω = dλ. The pull-back 1-form ι
∗λ ∈
Ω1(L) is closed, we denote its cohomology class in H1(L,R) as α. The class α
is independent of the choice of λ due to the assumption that H1(M,R) = 0.
Definition 2.1. Assume that µ 6= 0 and α 6= 0. Then L is monotone if α = cµ
for some c ∈ R \ {0}.
Let Ham(M,L) denote the group of all symplectomorphisms φ : (M,ω) →
(M,ω) such that φ(L) = L and φ is the time one map of some time dependent
Hamiltonian vector field on M , and the vector field has compact support.
2
A map φ ∈ Ham(M,L) induces an isomorphism onH1(L,Z) ∼= Z2 and hence
on H1(L,R), preserving both µ and σ. If µ and α are R-linearly independent
then φ∗ = id on both H1(L,Z) and H1(L,R). Below we consider the monotone
case only. For φ ∈ Ham(M,L) we call the induced isomorphism φ∗ : H1(L,Z)→
H1(L,Z) the monodromy of φ.
Definition 2.2. We define the Hamiltonian monodromy group of L ⊂ M (or
Ham(M,L)) to be
HL = {φ∗ ∈ Isom(H1(L,Z)) | φ ∈ Ham(M,L)}.
Consider the subgroup of Isom(H1(L,Z)):
Gµ := {g ∈ Isom(H1(L,Z)) | µ ◦ g = µ}.
Clearly HL is a subgroup of Gµ.
If we fix a basis for H1(L,Z) then the group Isom(H1(L,Z)) is identified
with the integral general linear group
GL(2,Z) =
{(a b
c d
)
| a, b, c, d ∈ Z, ad− bc = ±1
}
.
In the following we fix a basis γ, σ for H1(L,Z) so that µ(γ) = min{µ(η) | η ∈
H1(L,Z), µ(η) > 0}, and σ ∈ kerµ. We identify an element pγ+qσ of H1(L,Z)
with the column vector (p, q)t ∈ Z2. Then µ is identified with the row vector
(mL, 0) ∈ Hom(H1(L,Z),Z) ∼= Z2 where mL = µ(γ), and φ∗ is identified with
an element of GL(2,Z) such that µ ◦ φ∗ = µ. We have the following:
Proposition 2.3. The group Gµ := {g ∈ GL(2,Z) | µ ◦ g = µ} is isomorphic
to the infinite dihedral group D∞ := 〈f0, f1 | f20 = e = f21 〉 = Z2 ∗ Z2 (see [7]),
where e denote the identity element.
Proof. A direct computation (identifying µ with (mL, 0)) shows that, with re-
spect to the basis {γ, σ} for H1(L,Z) as described above,
Gµ =
{(
1 0
k ±1
)
| k ∈ Z
}
.
Let fk :=
(
1 0
k −1
)
and gk :=
(
1 0
k 1
)
. We have
(i). f2k = e and gk = g
k
1 for k ∈ Z, gk has infinite order for k 6= 0,
(ii). g1 = f1f0 and hence g−1 = g−11 = f0f1,
(iii). fk+1 = gkf1 = (f1f0)
kf1 = f1g−k and f−k = g−kf0 = (f0f1)kf0 = f0gk
for k ≥ 0.
Readers can check that Gµ is indeed freely generated by the two elements f0
and f1 of order 2, hence Gµ is isomorphic to the infinite dihedral group.
3
Remark 2.4. Geometrically gk is a (±k)-Dehn twist along the curve represent-
ing the class σ. The ±-sign ambiguity is to the non-uniqueness of σ which is
unique only up to signs.
Remark 2.5. Sometimes it is more convenient to consider a different basis
{γ, γ′ := γ + σ} for H1(L,Z). The transformation matrix from basis {γ, γ′} to
basis {γ, σ} is T :=
(
1 1
0 1
)
. We use ˜ to denote the matrix representation
with respect to the basis {γ, γ′}. Then for k ∈ Z,
f˜k := T
−1fkT =
(
1− k 2− k
k k − 1
)
, g˜k := T
−1gkT =
(
1− k −k
k 1 + k
)
.
Lemma 2.6. Let fk, gk be as in the proof of Proposition 2.3. Then fkfl = gk−l
and hence fk = gk−lfl for k, l ∈ Z.
Proof. By applying (iii) from the proof of Proposition 2.3, we have fkf0 = gk
and f0fl = g−l for k, l ∈ Z. Hence fkfl = (fkf0)(f0fl) = gkg−l = gk−l. i.e.,
fk = gk−lfl, for k, l ∈ Z.
Lemma 2.6 in particular implies a different (but well-known) way of express-
ing Gµ ∼= D∞ by generators and relations:
(1) Gµ ∼= D∞ = 〈f, g | f2 = e, fgf = g−1〉.
Definition 2.7. An element f ∈ Gµ is called an involution if f2 = e and f 6= e,
a twist if ord(f) =∞.
Then, with the matrix representations adapted in the proof of Proposition
2.3, fk ∈ Gµ is an involution for any k ∈ Z, and gk a twist for any k ∈ Z \ {0}.
Lemma 2.8. Let H ⊂ Gµ be a subgroup of Gµ. We adapt the notations fk, gk
from the proof of Proposition 2.3. Then we have the following classification of
H:
(i). H = {e}.
(ii). If H 6= {e} and H has no involutions, then H = 〈gd〉 ∼= Z for some d ∈ N.
(iii). If H contains exactly one involution say, fk, then H = 〈fk〉 ∼= Z2.
(iv). If H contains two involutions, then there exist some k, d ∈ N such that
H = 〈fk, gd〉 ∼= D∞.
Proof. For computational simplicity, we adapt the matrix representations and
notations from the proof of Proposition 2.3.
Assume that H has no involutions. Then H is a subgroup of the free abelian
group 〈g1〉 generated by g1 ∈ Gµ. Hence H = 〈gd〉 for some d ∈ N, H ∼= Z.
Now suppose that H contains exactly one involution say, fk, for some k ∈ Z.
We claim that H = {e, fk} and hence H ∼= Z2. Otherwise, we would have
4
gl ∈ H for some l ∈ Z, l 6= 0. But then fk+l = glfk ∈ H by Lemma 2.6, which
contradicts with our assumption on H. Hence H = {e, fk} ∼= Z2 for some k ∈ Z.
Finally, assume that H contains more than one involution. Let
d := min{|k − l| | fk, fl ∈ H, fk 6= fl} ∈ N
Fix a number k ∈ Z such that fk, fk+d ∈ H. We claim that H is generated by
fk and fk+d. More precisely we will show that
(i). gm ∈ H iff d divides m,
(ii). fn ∈ H iff d divides n− k.
Assume that m = ds for some s ∈ Z. Then gm = gds = gsd = (fk+dfk)s ∈ H.
Similarly, assume that n = k+dr for some r ∈ Z. then fn = fk+dr = gdrfk ∈ H.
Conversely, assume that gm ∈ H fro some m = ds+ r ∈ Z with d, s, r ∈ Z, 0 <
r < d. Then gr = gmg−ds ∈ H and fk+r = grfk ∈ H. But then |(k+r)−k| < d,
which contradicts with the minimality of d. Similarly, if fn ∈ H for some n ∈ Z,
then gn−k = fnfk ∈ H, which implies that d divides n − k. This verifies the
claim. So H is freely generated by fk, fk+d, two elements of order 2. Hence
H is isomorphic to D∞. Since gd = fk+dfk, H is also generated by fk and gd.
Finally, replacing fk by fk+sd = gsdfk for some s ∈ N large enough if necessary,
we may assume that k > 0 This completes the proof.
Definition 2.9. Let f ∈ HL be an involution. Then f is diagonalizable with
eigenvalues 1,−1. Let Fix(f) := {η ∈ H1(L,Z) | f(η) = η} There is a unique
element ηf ∈ Fix(f) such that Fix(f) is generated by ηf and µ(ηf ) > 0. Define
mf := µ(ηf )/mL ∈ N.
Recall that σ ∈ H1(L,Z) denotes a fixed primitive class with µ(σ) = 0.
Proposition 2.10. Let mf be as defined above. Then mf = 1 or 2. Moreover,
if we fix an arbitrary basis for H1(L,Z) and represent ηf , σ respectively as the
first and second column vectors of an integral 2×2 matrix A, then mf = | det(A)|
the absolute value of the determinant of A.
Proof. Fix a basis for H1(L,Z) ∼= Z2 and express ηf =
(
a
c
)
and σ =
(
b
d
)
as column vectors with respect to the basis. Let m := detA = ad − bc =
det
(
a b
c d
)
∈ Z \ {0}. Now in matrix form
f =
(
a b
c d
)(
1 0
0 −1
)(
a b
c d
)−1
=
(
1 + 2bc
m

m

m

m
)
∈ GL(2,Z)
So ab
m
, ad

, cb

, cd
m
∈ 12Z. Note that b, d are coprime, so there exist r1, r2 ∈ Z such
that r1b+r2d = 1. Then r1 · bam +r2 · dam = am ∈ 12Z and r1 · bcm+r2 · dcm = cm ∈ 12Z.
Since a, c are coprime we must have m | 2.
5
Elements of H1(L,Z) are represented as column vectors with integral coef-
ficients. Let n1, n2 ∈ Z so that n1mL = µ
((
1
0
))
and n2mL = µ
((
0
1
))
. By
definition we have µ
((a
c
))
= mfmL and µ
((b
d
))
= 0. So
(
a c
b d
)(
n1
n2
)
=
(
mf
0
)
, i.e.,
(
n1
n2
)
=
mf
m
(
d
−b
)
.
Note that n1, n2 are coprime since µ(H1(L,Z)) = 2Z. Also, 0 = µ
((
b
d
))
=
bn1 + dn2, so we have
(
n1
n2
)
= ±
(
d
−b
)
, hence mf = |m| = | det(A)| which
equals 1 or 2.
Now if we choose another basis for H1(L,Z) and correspondingly represent
the ordered pair (ηf , σ) by a matrix A
′. Then A′ = BA for some B ∈ GL(2,Z),
hence | det(A′)| = | det(A)| = mf . This completes the proof.
Example 2.11. Let fk =
(
1 0
k −1
)
be as defined in the proof of Proposition
2.3. Then mfk =
{
1 if k is even,
2 if k is odd.
This is a straightforward computation. Let f = fk. Write ηf =
(
a
b
)
then
ηf = f(ηf ) =
(
a
ak − b
)
. Since a, b are coprime we have that a = 1 (the positive
sign follows from µ(ηf ) > 0) provided that b = 0. In this case we obtain that
µ(ηf ) = mL and hence mf = 1.
If b 6= 0 then, since ak = 2b we have k 6= 0 and
(
a
b
)
= t ·
(
2
k
)
for some
t ∈ Q. It follows that
(i). t = 1 if k is odd, then µ(ηf ) = 2mL, mf = 2;
(ii). t = 12 if k is even and nonzero, then µ(ηf ) = mL, mf = 1.
This competes the computation.
From the perspective of the Maslov class µ, involutions of Gµ fall into two
different types according to their values of mf . Thus in addition to the group
type of HL the Hamiltonian monodromy group of L as listed in Lemma 2.8, mf
can be used to construct further invariants forHL provided that some element of
H is an involution. Also, if HL contains some twist elements, the twist number
can also be defined for HL. Below we define the new invariants for L.
Definition 2.12. Let L be monotone and HL its Hamiltonian monodromy
group. We adapt the notations fk, gk from the proof of Proposition 2.3.
6
Let T ⊂ H be the subset of all twists of H. The twist number of HL is
defined to be
t(L) :=
{
d = min{k > 0 | gk ∈ T } if T 6= ∅,
0 if T = ∅.
Let S ⊂ H denote the subset of all involutions of H. The spectrum of HL is
defined to be
s(L) :=
{
min{mf | f ∈ S} if S 6= ∅,
0 if S = ∅.
In particular, if HL ∼= Z2, then t(L) = 0, and s(L) = 1 or 2.
Lemma 2.13. The numbers t(L), s(L) are invariants of monotone Lagrangian
torus L up to Hamiltonian isotopies.
Proof. Given a pair of Hamiltonian isotopic monotone Lagrangian tori L0, L1
and let Lt := φt(L0), t ∈ [0, 1], be a Hamiltonian isotopy between L0 and L1.
Here φt is the time t map of a time dependent Hamiltonian vector field. The
Lt is monotonic for all t ∈ [0, 1]. Clearly φ−1t ◦Ham(M,Lt) ◦ φt = Ham(M,L0)
for all t and hence φ∗tHt = H0 where Ht is the Hamiltonian monodromy group
of Lt. By continuity we have t(Lt) = t(L0) and s(Lt) = s(L0) for all t ∈ [0, 1].
This completes the proof.
3 Examples in R4: Clifford tori and Chekanov
tori
Basic properties of Lagrangian tori in R4. Let M = R4 with the standard
symplectic structure ω =
∑2
j=1 dxj ∧ dyj . Readers can check that c1(R4) = 0
and H1(R4,R) = 0. Let λ denote a primitive of ω, dλ = ω. Let L
ι→֒ R4 be
an embedded torus. Using pseudoholomorphic curves, Gromov [6] showed L is
not exact, i.e., the closed 1-form ι∗λ ∈ Ω1(L) is not exact. So the action class
α := [ι∗λ] ∈ H1(L,R) is nontrivial. Polterovich [9] proved that the Maslov class
µ ∈ H1(L,Z) has divisibility 2, i.e., 2 = min{µ(γ) | γ ∈ H1(L,Z), µ(γ) > 0}.
Clifford tori. For a, b > 0 the Clifford torus
Ta,b := {|z1| = a, |z2| = b} ⊂ R4
is Lagrangian. It is monotone iff a = b.
Using symplectic capacities introduced by Ekeland and Hofer, Chekanov [1]
proved the following:
Proposition 3.1 (Chekanov [1]). Two Clifford tori Ta,b, Ta′,b′ are Hamiltonian
isotopic iff Ta′,b′ = Ta,b or Tb,a.
7
Lemma 3.2. The Hamiltonian monodromy group Hb of Tb,b is a group of order
2, i.e., it is generated by a single involution, hence t(Tb,b) = 0. Moreover
s(Tb,b) = 2.
Proof. We take γ ∈ H1(Tb,b,R) to be the class represented by the curve
{(beiθ, b) ∈ C × C} | θ ∈ [0, 2π]}. We also take γ′ ∈ H1(Tb,b,R) to be the
class represented by the curve {(b, beiθ) ∈ C × C} | θ ∈ [0, 2π]}. It can be
checked that µ(γ) = 2 = µ(γ′). With this understood we adapt the notations
f˜k, g˜k for monodromies from Remark 2.5 in Section 2.
We identify Tb,b with L = R/Z × R/Z with coordinates (t1, t2) so that, for
t ∈ R/Z,
(2) {(t, 0)} represents the class γ, and {(0, t)} represents the class γ′.
Also let (s1, s2) be the dual coordinates for fibers of the cotangent bundle T
∗L.
The cotangent bundle (T ∗L,−dλcan)) is symplectic, where λcan is the canonical
1-form (see [8]), λcan = s1dt1 + s2dt2. We also use the identification R
4 ∼= C2 =
{(r1e
√−1θ1 , r2e
√−1θ2) | ri ≥ 0, θi ∈ R/2πZ}.
Now consider the map Φ : T ∗L→ R4 ∼= C2 = {(r1e
√−1θ1 , r2e
√−1θ2)},
Φ(t1, t2, s1, s2) :=
(√
b2 − s1
π
e2π
√−1t1 ,
√
b2 − s2
π
e2π
√−1t2
)
.
The map Φ is defined on the domain UL := {s1 < πb2, s2 < πb2}, and is a
symplectic embedding from UL into R
4, Tb,b ⊂ Φ(UL).
Consider the primitive 1-form λ = 12 (r
2
1dθ1 + r
2
2dθ2) of ω. We have Φ
∗λ =
πb2(dt1 + dt2)− λcan. Also, Let Lc1,c2 := {s1 = c1, s2 = c2} ⊂ UL, then
(3) Φ(Lc1,c2) = T
√
b2− c1
π
,
√
b2− c2
π
.
In the following we use Φ to identify a small neighborhood of Tb,b with
Uδ := {|s1| < δ, |s2| < δ} for δ > 0 small.
We claim that g˜k 6∈ Hb for any k 6= 0. Assume in the contrary that g˜k ∈ Hb
for some k 6= 0. Let φ ∈ Ham(R4, Tb,b) be one with φ∗ = gk. Modifying φ by a
L-preserving Hamiltonian isotopy if necessary, we may assume that, on Uδ for
some δ > 0,
φ(t1, t2, s1, s2) = ((1−k)t1−kt2, kt1+(1+k)t2, (1+k)s1−ks2, ks1+(1−k)s2).
Then, by taking c1 = 0 and c2 = ǫ > 0 very small, we have
φ(L0,ǫ) = L−kǫ,(1−k)ǫ.
and hence (via Φ)
φ(T
b,
√
b2− ǫ
π
) = T√
b2−−kǫ
π
,
q
b2− (1−k)ǫ
π
.
8
It then implies that, for all ǫ > 0 small enough, the Clifford tori T
b,
√
b2− ǫ
π
and T√
b2−−kǫ
π
,
q
b2− (1−k)ǫ
π
are Hamiltonian isotopic, which cannot be possible by
Proposition 3.1, unless k = 0. Thus g˜k 6∈ Hb for any k 6= 0. Hence t(Tb,b) = 0.
Note that since f˜kf˜l = g˜k−l, Hb can contain at most one involution. In fact
there exists a Hamiltonian self-isotopy of Tb,b with monodromy f˜1 =
(
0 1
1 0
)
.
To see this, First let us consider the path in the unitary group U(2) defined by
At :=
(
cos πt2 − sin πt2
sin πt2 cos
πt
2
)
∈ GL(2,C), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
At acts on C
2, is the time t map of the Hamiltonian vector field X = π2 (x1∂x2 −
x2∂x1 + y1∂y2 − y2∂y1), ω(X, ·) = −dH , H = π2 (x2y1 − x1y2). Observe that
A1(Ta,b) = Tb,a, (A1)∗ = f˜1 onH1(Tb,b,Z). Fix b > 0 and modify H to get a C∞
function H˜ with compact support such that H˜ = H on {|z1| ≤ 2b, |z2| ≤ 2b}.
Let φt be the time t map of the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field associated
to H˜ . Then φ1(Tb,b) = (Tb,b), and (φ1)∗ = (A1)∗ = f˜1 on H1(Tb,b,Z). Hence
Hb is a group of order 2 generated by the involution f˜1. Hence s(Tb,b) = 2 by
Remark 2.5, Proposition 2.10 and Remark 2.11.
Chekanov tori. Now we consider another type of monotone Lagrangian tori in
R4: the Chekanov tori (called special tori in [1]). Consider the diffeomorphism
ρ : T ∗S1 = S1×R → E := R2x1,x2\{(0, 0)} defined by ρ(θ, s) = (es cos θ, es sin θ).
The corresponding map ρ∗ : T ∗E ⊂ R4 → T ∗(T ∗S1) is a symplectomorphism
between two cotangent bundles. Let
Ψ := (ρ∗)−1 : T ∗(T ∗S1) = (T ∗S1)× R2 → T ∗E = E × R2y1,y2 ⊂ R4
be the inverse symplectic map. Let (θ, s) ∈ S1 × R be coordinates for T ∗S1,
(θ∗, s∗) be the dual coordinate for the fiber of T ∗(T ∗S1). Let (x1, x2, y1, y2) be
coordinates for E × R2. Then
Ψ(θ, s, θ∗, s∗) = (es cos θ, es sin θ, e−s(−θ∗ sin θ+s∗ cos θ), e−s(θ∗ cos θ+s∗ sin θ)).
From now on, we will identify T ∗(T ∗S1) with its image in R4 via Ψ.
For a ∈ R and b > 0 the torus
T ′a,b := {θ∗ = a, s2 + (s∗)2 = b2}
is Lagrangian. Moreover, for a 6= 0, T ′a,b is Hamiltonian isotopic to the Clifford
torus Tb,b+|a| by Chekanov [1]. The a = 0 case is special. We call the special
torus T ′0,b a Chekanov torus. T
′
0,b is monotone, is Lagrangian isotopic to Tb,b
but not Hamiltonian isotopic to Tb,b. [1, 2].
Lemma 3.3. The Hamiltonian monodromy group H′b of T ′0,b is a group of order
2, i.e., it is generated by a single involution, hence t(T ′0,b) = 0. Moreover
s(T ′0,b) = 1.

Proof. Let γ ∈ H1(T ′0,b,Z) be represented by the curve (θ, s, θ∗, s∗) =
(0, b cos t, 0, b sin t), σ ∈ H1(T ′0,b,Z) be represented by the curve (θ, s, θ∗, s∗) =
(t, b, 0, 0). It can be verified that µ(γ) = 2 and µ(σ) = 0. With this understood
we adapt the notations fk, gk for monodromies from the proof of Proposition
2.3.
We identify Tb,b with L = R/Z × R/Z with coordinates (t1, t2) so that, for
t ∈ R/Z,
(4) {(t, 0)} represents the class γ, and {(0, t)} represents the class σ.
Also let (s1, s2) be the dual coordinates for the fiber of T
∗L. . The cotangent
bundle (T ∗L,−dλcan)) is symplectic, where λcan is the canonical 1-form (see
[8]), λcan = s1dt1 + s2dt2.
Consider the map Φ′ : T ∗L→ T ∗(S1 × R) = {(θ, s, θ∗, s∗)},
Φ′(t1, t2, s1, s2) := (t2,
√
b2 − s1
π
cos 2πt1, s2,
√
b2 − s1

sin 2πt1).
The map Φ′ is defined on the domain U ′L := {s1 < πb2} ⊂ T ∗L, and is a
symplectic embedding from U ′L into T
∗(S1 × R). Also T ′0,b ⊂ Φ′(U ′L).
Let Lc1,c2 := {s1 = c1, s2 = c2} ⊂ U ′L, then for c2 6= 0,
(5) Ψ ◦Φ′(Lc1,c2) = Ψ

where the second equality is up to a Hamiltonian isotopy.
Assume there exists φ ∈ Ham(R4, T ′0,b) with monodromy gk for some k ∈ Z.
Modifying φ by a L-preserving Hamiltonian isotopy if necessary we may assume
that, for some δ > 0 small enough,
φ(θ1, θ2, s1, s2) = (θ1, kθ1 + θ2, s1 − ks2, s2) on U ′δ.
Then φ(Lc1,c2) = Lc1−kc2,c2 .
Now, by taking c1 = c2 = ǫ > 0 very small, we have
φ(Lǫ,ǫ) = L(1−k)ǫ,ǫ.
and hence (via Ψ ◦ Φ′, see (5))
φ(T√

are Hamiltonian isotopic for all ǫ > 0 small
enough, which cannot be possible by Proposition 3.1, unless k = 0. Thus
gk 6∈ H′b for any k 6= 0. Hence t(T ′0,b) = 0.
Then H′b can contain at most one involution. Below we will construct φ ∈
Ham(R4, T ′0,b) with monodromy φ∗ = f0 =
(
1 0
0 −1
)
. First observe that T ′0,b is
contained in the hyper-surface {θ∗ = 0} ⊂ T ∗(S1 × R) and hence in (via Ψ)
(6) {(x1, y1, x2, y2) = (es cos θ, e−ss∗ cos θ, es sin θ, e−ss∗ sin θ)} ⊂ R4.

For t ∈ [0, 1] the symplectomorphism At : C2 → C2, At(z1, z2) = (eiπtz1, z2),
is the time t map of the Hamiltonian vector field X = π(x1∂y1 − y1∂x1) whose
Hamiltonian function is H = π2 |z1|2. Observe that A1 preserves the hyper-
surface in (6) and send the point in (6) to the point
(x1, y1, x2, y2) = (−es cos θ,−e−ss∗ cos θ, es sin θ, e−ss∗ sin θ)
= (es cos(π − θ),−e−ss∗ cos(π − θ), es sin(π − θ), e−ss∗ sin(π − θ)).
(7)
Hence A1(T
′
0,b) = T
′
0,b. Moreover, (A1)∗γ = γ and (A1)∗σ = −σ, i.e., (A1)∗ = f0
on H1(T
′
0,b,Z).
We modify H to get H˜ ∈ C∞(R4) with compact support, such that H˜ = H
on {|z1| ≤ e2b, |z2| ≤ e2b}. Let φt be the time t map of the flow of the
Hamiltonian vector field associated to H˜. Then φ1(T
′
0,b) = T
′
0,b and (φ1)∗ =
(A1)∗ = f0 onH1(T ′0,b,Z). SoHb is generated by the involution f0 and s(T ′0,b) =
1 by Proposition 2.10, Remark 2.11 and Definition 2.12.
Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 3.3 together imply Theorem 1.1.
Final discussion. We end this note with the following open questions.
Question 3.4. Let L ⊂ R4 be any monotone Lagrangian torus. Is it true that
HL ∼= Z2?
Question 3.5. Let L ⊂ (R4, ω) be either a monotone Clifford torus Tb,b or a
Chekanov torus T ′0,b. Let B ⊂ R4 be an open 4-ball containing L. Assume there
is a symplectic embedding φ : (B,ω) → (M,ωM ), where M is symplectic with
c1(M) = 0 and H
1(M,R) = 0. Let HB (resp. HM ) denote the Hamiltonian
monodromy group of L in B (resp. in M). Via the inclusion φ, HB ∼= Z2 is a
subgroup of HM . Is it possible that HB is a proper subgroup of HM?
Question 3.6. How to extend the constructions of t(L), s(L) to higher dimen-
sional cases, to distinguish monotone Lagrangian tori in R2n and beyond?
