ABSTRACT
RNA interference through the expression of small
hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules has become a very
promising tool in reverse mouse genetics as it may
allow inexpensive and rapid gene function analysis
in vivo. However, the prerequisites for ubiquitous
and reproducible shRNA expression are not well
defined. Here we show that a single copy shRNA-
transgene can mediate body-wide gene silencing in
mice when inserted in a defined locus of the genome.
The most commonly used promoters for shRNA
expression, H1 and U6, showed a comparably broad
activity in this configuration. Taken together, the res-
ults define a novel approach for efficient interference
with expression of defined genes in vivo. Moreover,
we provide a rapid strategy for the production of gene
knockdown mice combining recombinase mediated
cassette exchange and tetraploid blastocyst comple-
mentation approaches.
INTRODUCTION
RNA interference (RNAi) (1) is based on the introduction of
double stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into cells, whereby
one strand is complementary to the coding region of the target
gene. Through pairing with the dsRNA, the target mRNAs are
degraded by a cellular mechanism. Sustained gene silencing
has been achieved by the intracellular transcription of small
inverted repeats separated by a spacer region (2). For the
expression of these short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), the RNA
polymerase III-dependent promoters U6 and H1 have been
used in most cases (2,3). These promoters produce small
transcripts lacking nonfunctional bases at the 50 end and a
poly-adenosine tail. The resulting shRNAs are processed
in vivo into active ‘small interfering’ RNAs. Several reports
describe the stable, shRNA-mediated gene silencing in mice
using random transgenesis (4–7). While this demonstrates that
shRNA-mediated gene knockdown in mice is feasible, the
requirements with respect to copy number and integration
site of the transgene for efficient gene silencing are still
unclear. Since previous experiments included random trans-
genesis, each of the resulting mouse lines showed a unique,
irreproducible shRNA expression pattern. In addition, screen-
ing of several embryonic stem cells or mouse lines with suf-
ficient siRNA expression was required, which is laborious and
time-consuming. Finally, the organ-specific activities of the
most commonly used promoters for shRNA expression, U6
and H1, have not been analyzed systematically. Thus, an
established protocol for simple and reproducible RNAi in
mice is not available.
Here we demonstrate that a single copy shRNA transgene
under the control of either the U6 or the H1 promoter mediates
efficient and ubiquitous gene knockdown in mice when
integrated at the rosa26 locus. By combining recombinase-
mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) at the rosa26 locus and
the tetraploid blastocyst complementation approach, we dras-
tically reduced the time and effort for generating shRNA
transgenic gene knockdown mice.

into 30 of the Renilla luciferase gene. shRNA cassettes: the
U6- and the H1-promoter fragments were amplified from
human genomic DNA and cloned in front of the Fluc-
specific shRNA (9) and five thymidines as termination signal
(shRNA). The shRNA expression cassettes were flanked by
loxP-sites (lox) to allow cre-mediated deletion.

Rosa26 targeting vector. The neomycin was deleted by
Flp-mediated deletion in bacteria (10). The final rosa (RMCE)
targeting vector (Figure 1A) was generated by standard clon-

resistance gene lacking the start ATG. The H1-promoter frag-
ment was amplified from human genomic DNA with attached
BbsI/AvrII sites and cloned into the basic exchange vector
(pRMCE-H1). LeptinR-specific shRNA sequence [aacagtcttc-

Cell culture
Culture and targeted mutagenesis of Art4.12 ES cells were
carried out as previously described (8,14). ES cells were cul-
tured in ES cell medium [DMEM with 15% fetal calf serum
(FCS) containing 2000 U/ml LIF (Chemicon)] on mitomycin
C-treated primary feeder fibroblasts. Prior to blastocyst injec-
tion ES cells were trypsinized, resuspended in ES cell medium
and pre-plated to remove feeder cells and debris.
For the Cre-mediated deletion of the shRNA cassette 1 · 107
cells were electroporated with 18 mg pCAGGScrepA (R. Ku¨hn,
unpublished) generated from pCAGGSflpe-ires-puro (15).
One half of the treated cells were plated on two 10 cm dishes.
At day 2 after the electroporation 1000 cells and 3000 cells
were replated on 10 cm dishes. At day 8 clones were isolated
on 96-well plates and analyzed by Southern blotting.
Transfection of cells with the exchange vector. One day before
transfection, 2 · 105 ES cells were plated on a 3 cm dish in 2 ml
medium. Before transfection 2 ml fresh medium was given to
the cells. 3ml Fugene6 Reagent (Roche; Catalog No. 1 814 443)
was mixed with 100 ml serum free medium (OptiMEM 1 with
Glutamax-I Invitrogen; Catalog No. 51985-035) and incubated
for 5 min. 100 ml of the Fugene/OptiMEM solution was added
to 2 mg circular DNA (c = 0.33 mg/ml) and incubated for 15 min.
This transfection complex was added drop wise to the medium
and mixed by a circuiting movement. Fresh medium was
added to the transfected cells the following day. From day
2 on, the medium was changed daily, replaced by medium
containing 250 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen; Catalog
No. 10131-019). Seven days after transfection, single clones
were isolated by standard procedures as described (16).
Mice
All mice were kept in the animal facility at Artemis Pharma-
ceuticals GmbH in microisolator cages (Tecniplast Sealsave).
B6D2F1 mice for the generation of tetraploid blastocysts were
obtained from Harlan, NL.
Production of ES mice by tetraploid embryo
complementation
The production of mice by tetraploid embryo complementa-
tion was essentially performed as described (17). Briefly,
embryo culture was carried out in microdrops on standard
bacterial Petri dishes (Falcon) under mineral oil (Sigma).
Modified CZB media (18) was used for embryo culture unless
otherwise noted. HEPES buffered CZB was used for room
temperature operations. After administration of hormones,
superovulated B6D2F1 females were mated with B6D2F1
males. Fertilized zygotes were isolated from the oviduct and
any remaining cumulus cells were removed with hyaluroni-
dase. After overnight culture, two-cell embryos were
electrofused using a CF-150B fusion chamber (BLS Ltd.,
Budapest, Hungary) to produce tetraploid embryos. Embryos
that had not undergone membrane fusion within 1 h were
discarded. Embryos were then cultured in vitro to the blasto-
cyst stage. For microinjection, 10–20 blastocysts were placed
in a drop of DMEM with 15% FCS under mineral oil. A flat tip,
piezo actuated microinjection-pipette with an internal dia-
meter of 12–15 mm was used to inject 20 ES cells into
each blastocyst. After recovery, 10 injected blastocysts were
transferred to each uterine horn of 2.5 days post coitum,
pseudopregnant NMRI females. Embryos were either deliv-
ered naturally or were recovered from recipient mothers by
C-section and subsequently cross-fostered.
Luciferase detection
Organs were homogenized at 4C in lysis buffer (0.1 M
KH2PO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100) using a tissue
grinder and centrifuged for 50 at 2000 g (4C). Supernatant
was assayed for Fluc activities using the Dual Luciferase
Assay (Promega, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col. The luminescence was detected using a Lumat LB 9507
(EG&G Berthold). Relative values of Fluc activity in different
organs are given as indicated. All values of Fluc activity were
normalized by using the Rluc activity for reference.
Histochemical detection of b-galactosidase activity
For preparation of histological sections, organs were embed-
ded in OCT tissue freezing medium (Leica&Jung No.
020108926), frozen on dry ice and sectioned using a Leica
CM3050 Cryostat. Sections were mounted onto slides and
dried for 1–4 h at room temperature. For histochemical detec-
tion of b-galactosidase activity, sections were fixed for 5 min
at room temperature using 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 5 mM EGTA
and 2 mM MgCl2 in phosphate buffer (80 mM K2HPO4,
20 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3). Sections were washed three
times in washing buffer (2 mM MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet-40,
80 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3) and finally incub-
ated in X-Gal staining solution [5 mM K3(Fe(CN)6), 5 mM
K4(Fe(CN)6), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml X-Gal in washing buffer]
for 12 h at 37C. Sections were washed twice in phosphate-
buffered saline and counterstained for 10 min with Nuclear
Fast Red. Sections were subsequently washed in distilled
water, dehydrated using graded ethanol concentrations (70,
90, 96 and 100% ethanol; 5 min incubation for each concen-
tration) and finally mounted using Entellan (Merck
No. 1.07961.0100). Images were taken using a Hitachi
HVC20M camera and the Diskus imaging program
(C. Hilgers, Ko¨nigswinter, Germany).
Real-time PCR
After tissue homogenization, RNA extraction was performed
with the RNeasyTM Mini Kit (Qiagen). Due to the usage of
exon-spanning TaqmanTM probes DNAse I digestion was
not necessary. First Strand cDNA synthesis was done using
Oligo-dT primers and SuperscriptTM II RT (Invitrogen). For
Taqman analysis 50 ng cDNA of each sample was used as
template. The analysis was performed on an ABI PRISMTM
7700 sequence detection system and quantification of relative
cDNA transcript amounts was calculated by the DDCt-method
(19). For leptin receptor detection the primers and probes were
used from Applied Biosystems (assay ID 0440188). Each
sample was analyzed in duplicates and normalized on TATA-
box binding protein representing the endogenous control.
Standard Curves had an R2 > 0.997.

RESULTS
Activity of shRNA transgenes upon insertion into
the rosa26 locus
To investigate the effect of different promoters on the level
and tissue specificity of shRNA-mediated gene inactivation,
we decided to test both, the H1 and U6 promoter in a particular
chromosomal locus. We performed a side-by-side comparison
of a firefly luciferase-specific shRNA transgene under the
control of the human H1 and U6 promoter, respectively.
A single copy of either of these constructs was inserted into
the rosa26 locus of ES cells to exclude variable position
effects (Figure 1). We have chosen rosa26 for this purpose,
since it has been described as being accessible for transcription
in all tissues (8,20). A dual reporter system was established
by the expression of both, the firefly luciferase (Fluc) as a test
substrate and the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as a reference to
quantify the degree of shRNA-mediated silencing. A similar
Fluc/Rluc system has been previously applied for the transient
assay of siRNA in vitro and in mice (21,22). We adapted this
system for our purpose by expressing both reporter genes
under the control of the ubiquitous rosa26 promoter. Each
of the luciferases along with a splice acceptor sequence
(23) was inserted downstream of the promoter of rosa26
through homologous recombination in ES cells (Figure 1).
The negative control was generated by cre-mediated deletion
of the loxP-flanked shRNA expression cassettes in ES cells
(data not shown).
Recombinant ES cells were injected into blastocysts and
chimeric mice were obtained upon transfer of blastocysts
into pseudopregnant females using standard protocols (16).
Figure 2A shows the activity of Fluc in different organs in
shRNA transgenic animals that were obtained from breeding
of chimeras. Expression of the shRNA under the control of
both, the U6 as well as the H1 promoter resulted in efficient
and ubiquitous repression of Fluc activity, ranging between 70
and 95% reduction in all organs except spleen and testis. This
result was reproducible in several, independent experiments
using mice ranging in age from 6 to 25 weeks (Figure 2).
RMCE strategy for the insertion of shRNA transgenes
into the rosa26 locus
To facilitate the introduction of shRNA transgenes into
the genome we adapted recombinase—mediated cassette
exchange (RMCE) to the rosa26 locus. The targeting vector
to prepare the rosa26 locus for RMCE is depicted in Figure 3.
The vector carries a FLPe expression cassette to provide the
recombinase for RMCE. The hygromycin resistance gene was
used for positive selection of homologous recombinant clones.
In addition, a zsGreen gene was placed between the FRT
and F3 sites to allow for the identification of recombinant
clones that have not undergone RMCE following secondary
transfection of the exchange vector. The splice acceptor site
(SA) and the ATG start codon should facilitate expression
of the truncated neomycin resistance gene (D50neoR) on the
exchange vector by employing the endogenous rosa26 pro-
moter following RMCE.
We used the hybrid ES cell line ART4.12 ([C57BL/6 ·
129S6/SvEvTac] F1) for homologous recombination, since
these lines result in ES cell derived mice (ES mice) through
tetraploid blastocyst complementation (8). ART4.12 cells
were transfected with the rosa26 targeting vector and cultured
in medium containing hygromycin B. Recombinant ES cell
clones [rosa26(RMCE)] were obtained at a frequency of 2% as
verified by Southern blot analysis (Figure 3C, first and second
lanes). For unknown reasons, the zsgreen gene turned out to be
non functional. The detection of green fluorescence was there-
fore not used in our screening setup.
The exchange vector (Figure 3B) carries the FRT and F3
sites together with a truncated neoR gene for positive selection
of RMCE. The upstream poly(A) signal was included to pre-
vent expression of the truncated neoR gene in ES cells car-
rying randomly integrated vectors. ES cells were transfected
with the exchange vector and selected in medium containing
G418. Southern blot analysis of G418 resistant colonies
revealed that successful RMCE had occurred in >95% of
clones (Figure 3C and data not shown).
Silencing of a highly expressed firefly luciferase
transgene
To determine whether the concentration of mRNA is critical
for the degree of shRNA-mediated RNAi, we used the strong
CAGGS promoter (13) for expression of the Fluc gene. A
CAGGS-Fluc expression cassette was inserted into the ES
cell genome using RMCE at the rosa26 locus to allow a
side-by-side comparison with the Fluc target under the control
of the endogenous rosa26 promoter. Recombinant ES cells
were injected into blastocysts and mice were obtained upon
transfer of blastocysts into pseudopregnant females. Compar-
ison of Fluc activities in various organs showed that the
CAGGS promoter conferred up to 100-fold higher expres-
sion level of the Fluc transgene compared with the endogenous
rosa26 promoter (Figure 2B). The Fluc-specific shRNA gene
under the control of the human U6 promoter and the CAGGS-
Fluc transgene were combined through breeding of mice.
Measurement of luciferase activity in protein extracts from
various organs revealed a roughly similar pattern of CAGGS-
Fluc repression compared with the shRNA-mediated knock-
down of rosa26-Fluc in all organs except liver (Figure 2C). In
liver, the degree of Fluc silencing was less pronounced com-
pared with the data from low expressing Fluc mice (51 versus
82% knockdown).
Analysis of shRNA-mediated knockdown at
the single cell level using lacZ
We next introduced a lacZ specific shRNA under the control
of the human U6 promoter through RMCE in ART4.12/
rosa26(RMCE) ES cells. Recombinant ES cells were injected
into tetraploid blastocysts and ES cell obtained mice were
derived as described (8). A highly expressed b-galactosidase
gene was provided through breeding using a mouse strain
carrying lacZ under the control of the ubiquitous CAGGS
promoter (13), that had been placed into the Rosa26 promoter.
In this strain, b-galactosidase is ubiquitously expressed at
high levels in every single cell of adult mice (S. Andreas
and N. Faust, unpublished data). X-Gal staining on tissue
sections revealed a strong, uniform expression of lacZ
under the control of the CAGGS promoter in every single
cell, whereas the presence of the shRNA construct resulted

Generation and analysis of leptin receptor
knockdown mice
The RMCE strategy was used for targeted insertion of a
shRNA sequence directed against all known splice variants
of the leptin receptor mRNA. We have chosen this target for
proof of concept, since the phenotype of leptin receptor defi-
ciency in db/db mice represents a well characterized disease
model, encompassing hyperphagia, obesity and insulin resist-
ance (24). The shRNA expression cassette was placed 30 of the
neoR gene on the exchange vector. Upon transfection, recom-
binase mediated integration of the exchange vector at the
rosa26 locus was observed in >90% of G418 resistant colonies
(Figure 3C). The activity of the inserted shRNA expression
cassette in the surviving ES cell clones was tested using real-
time PCR analysis. The presence of leptin receptor specific
shRNA transgene resulted in a >70% reduction of leptin
receptor mRNA. In contrast, a p53-specific shRNA construct
in a similar configuration did not affect the level of leptin
receptor mRNA (data not shown), confirming the specificity
of the selected shRNA.
ShRNA transgenic ES cells were injected into tetraploid
blastocysts and ES cell derived mice were obtained three
weeks later at a frequency of 3%. Real-time PCR analysis
of 15-week-old mice indicated a >80% reduction of leptin
receptor mRNA in most organs, reaching 95–99% in heart,
brain, muscle, pancreas and white adipose tissue (Figure 5). In
liver, the degree of leptin receptor repression reached 65%.
Initial inspection of leptin receptor knockdown mice revealed
a strongly increased food intake and 30% increased body
weight when fed with normal diet (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this report, we describe a defined, single copy shRNA
configuration that mediates efficient and ubiquitous gene
knockdown in mice. We provide the first side-by-side com-
parison of the most commonly used promoters for shRNA
expression, U6 and H1. ShRNA expression cassettes were
inserted into the rosa26 locus through targeted transgenesis
in ES cells. Both, the U6 and the H1 promoter, showed a
comparably broad activity in this configuration, resulting in
70–95% silencing of the luciferase reporter gene in most
organs. Single cell analysis of tissue sections demonstrated
that the degradation of target mRNAs is achieved in the vast
majority rather than in just a fraction of cells (Figure 4). We did
not observe a strong impact of the mRNA level, as the
comparison of the Fluc target expressed at different levels
did not significantly affect the degree of knockdown
(Figure 2). Also, the organ-specific pattern was highly repro-
ducible using different reporter targets. The reason for the
lower degree of RNAi observed in lymphocytes, testes, and,
in some cases, in liver remains unclear. It is unlikely that a
limited activity of RNA polymerase III-dependent promoters
accounts for these differences as Oberdoerffer et al. (25) did
not find any obvious correlation of shRNA expression level
and RNAi efficiency. We rather suspect that the degree of
RNAi is affected by other factors, such as the availability
of RISC and/or dicer proteins.
We confirmed the activity of our configuration by introdu-
cing a leptin receptor specific shRNA construct under the
control of the H1 promoter at the rosa26 locus. Here, repres-
sion of the endogenous target ranged between 95–99% in
brain, heart muscle, pancreas and white adipose tissue.
Gross inspection of the phenotype revealed a significantly
increased food intake and body weight when fed with normal
diet (data not shown), reproducing aspects of the phenotype
found in db/db mice. A detailed characterization of the strain is
ongoing and will be published elsewhere.
Sustained, shRNA-mediated RNAi in mice had been
demonstrated in recent publications using random transgen-
esis (4–7,26,27). Several technical approaches have followed:
pronuclear injection and transfection of plasmid-based
shRNA constructs, as well as lentiviral infection. Pronuclear
injection of transgenes resulted in individual founder lines,
each with a unique and irreproducible pattern of shRNA
expression (27,28). Depending on the site of transgene integ-
ration, the efficiency of gene silencing in those animals
was variable ranging from undetectable levels to >90%.
Rosenquist et al. failed to produce any distinct phenotype
when shRNA constructs directed against seven known targets
were introduced via the standard transgenesis approach (28).

To circumvent this problem, transfected ES cells were
screened for proper shRNA expression prior to the generation
transgenic mouse lines through blastocyst injection (4,28).
While the severity of the observed in vivo phenotypes cor-
related roughly with the strength of shRNA expression in ES
cells, the level and pattern of gene silencing was still variable
in these experiments. Thus, a thorough characterization of the
resulting mouse lines is still required to determine the level of
RNAi in all relevant organs. Moreover, the approach is just
applicable for a fraction of target genes that are expressed in
ES cells. Lentivirus-based vectors were used for the introduc-
tion of shRNA transgenes into primary cells, ES cells and
embryos (5–7). Again, only a fraction of infected cells
showed detectable RNAi at various levels (7), indicating
that the activity of lentiviral vectors is subjected to position
dependent modulation. Taken together, all previous reports
describing shRNA-mediated gene knockdown in mice
employed random transgenesis, requiring time-consuming
and laborious screening of embryonic stem cell or mouse
lines due to the inherent problem of position-dependent
effects on transgene expression.
Our targeted transgenesis strategy for the insertion of
shRNA expression cassettes has several advantages over the
current approaches of random transgenesis: The configuration
at the rosa26 locus mediates efficient RNAi in most organs.
The shRNA expression pattern in mice is predictable and not
affected by variable chromosomal position effects. Therefore,
the generation and time-consuming characterization of mul-
tiple transgenic strains for a given shRNA transgene is not
required. Furthermore, a single copy of the shRNA gene is
inserted into the genome, avoiding modulation of shRNA
expression by secondary rearrangement of multiple copy
arrays or segregation of transgenes integrated at different
chromosomal loci.
To speed up the generation of shRNA transgenic animals,
we adapted recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE)
to the rosa26 locus. So far, only few examples of successful
RMCE in ES had been described (15,26,29–32). In these
experiments, random integration of the exchange vector as well
as incomplete recombination frequently produced unwanted
transgene configurations. The efficiency of RMCE varied
strongly, depending on the choice of recombination sites,
the selection strategy and the chromosomal target. The fol-
lowing features where combined in our RMCE strategy to
address these problems.
(i) We utilized Flp-mediated RMCE using a wild type Flp
target site (FRT) in combination with an inverted F3
site (11). The F3/F3 couple is recombined by FLP with
the same efficiency as two wild type recombinase recogni-
tion sites (RRS) whereas recombination of a FRT/F3 pair
is not catalyzed (33). This characteristic contrasts other
pairs of wild type and mutant RRS, such as loxp/lox511,
that was found to mediate a residual recombination
activity (34,35).
(ii) We added a constitutive FLPe expression cassette on the
targeting vector to provide sufficient recombinase activity
until successful RMCE of the exchange vector. Thus,
incomplete recombination intermediates as observed by
Belteki et al. (29) should be avoided.
(iii) A 50 truncated neomycin phosphotransferase gene includ-
ing a splice acceptor site but lacking a functional promoter
was inserted into the exchange vector. Expression of the
selection marker should therefore be mediated by the

endogenous rosa26 promoter following successful
RMCE, but not through random integration of the
exchange vector.
We found that our RMCE strategy facilitates the insertion of
shRNA transgenes into the rosa26 locus with high efficiencies,
consistently reaching a frequency of >90% correct clones.
Given the simple cloning strategy for the insertion of
shRNA transgenes into the RMCE exchange vector and the
limited screening efforts, our RMCE approach largely facil-
itates the generation of shRNA transgenic mice. By employing
the tetraploid blastocyst complementation approach for the
direct generation of ES cell derived mice, we further reduced
the production time to less than 2 months (1 week for cloning
of the RMCE exchange vector, 3 weeks for generating targeted
ES cell clones, 3 weeks for the generation of newborn mice
through tetraploid blastocyst injection).
Taken together, we describe a novel approach to efficiently
knock down genes in mice in a much easier, faster and more
predictable manner than achieved by conventional techniques.
Combined with engineered H1 or U6 promoters allowing the
temporal control of shRNA expression (7,36,37) our strategy
may provide a general tool for rapid gene function analysis in
adult animals.
