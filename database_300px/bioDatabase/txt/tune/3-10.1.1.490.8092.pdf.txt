ABSTRACT
The PlantTribes database (http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/
tribe.html) is a plant gene family database based
on the inferred proteomes of five sequenced plant
species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Carica papaya,
Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa and Populus
trichocarpa. We used the graph-based clustering
algorithm MCL [Van Dongen (Technical Report INS-
R0010 2000) and Enright et al. (Nucleic Acids Res.
2002; 30: 1575–1584)] to classify all of these species’
protein-coding genes into putative gene families,
called tribes, using three clustering stringencies
(low, medium and high). For all tribes, we have
generated protein and DNA alignments and
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees. A parallel
database of microarray experimental results is
linked to the genes, which lets researchers identify
groups of related genes and their expression
patterns. Unified nomenclatures were developed,
and tribes can be related to traditional gene families
and conserved domain identifiers. SuperTribes,
constructed through a second iteration of MCL
clustering, connect distant, but potentially related
gene clusters. The global classification of nearly
200000 plant proteins was used as a scaffold for
sorting 4 million additional cDNA sequences from
over 200 plant species. All data and analyses are
accessible through a flexible interface allowing
users to explore the classification, to place query
sequences within the classification, and to download
results for further study.
INTRODUCTION
A common goal of current plant genomics research is to
establish an expandable platform for global classiﬁcation
and analysis of plant gene family space. A large fraction of
genes in plant genomes are the product of duplication and
novel gene creation processes that have occurred within
plants over their 500-million-year history. Gene classiﬁca-
tions that attempt to capture all of eukaryote diversity
typically provide a poor representation of plant gene sets.
With more than a dozen plant genomes scheduled
for completion over the next two years, and many
additional genome and transcriptome projects being
initiated, there is a need for ﬂexible, gene family-focused
databases that provide rich toolsets for comparative
analyses of plant genomes. Comparative analyses of
the modeled proteomes for sequenced genomes can help
verify gene content and elucidate the process of gene
duplication and functional diversiﬁcation. Cross-valida-
tion of gene models for available plant genomes and
nucleotide sequence translations of EST sets for other
plant species can be achieved through clustering and
similarity analyses involving whole-genome sequences
and large EST sets [e.g. (3–5); TIGR Plant Transcript
Assemblies, (6)].
The PlantTribes database is a global classiﬁcation of
genes from all of the ﬁve sequenced plant genomes:
Arabidopsis thaliana, Carica papaya (papaya), Medicago

truncatula (barrel medic, 60% sequenced), Populus tricho-
carpa (poplar) and Oryza sativa (rice). The database also
contains unigene sets from the TIGR Plant Transcript
Assemblies (6), which includes 4 million sequences from
more than 200 species, that facilitates a wide range of
comparative study of plant genes and gene families.
PlantTribes oﬀers a unique view of objectively deﬁned
gene families that facilitates comparative analyses of plant
genomes. For example, our database allows one to
identify all gene families of a given size in a species and
quickly assess the range of copy numbers for closely
related genes in other plant genomes. Families that have
remained stable in size, or have proliferated greatly in one
genome compared to another can easily be identiﬁed.
In our own research, this type of analysis has aided
interpretation of gene family stability and diversiﬁcation
in the face of gene and whole genome duplications (e.g. 24,
25, 30, 31). Integration of expression data, linked
seamlessly to the tribe gene classiﬁcation, will facilitate
studies of expression divergence following gene duplica-
tion (e.g. 17). PlantTribes can aid comparative analyses by
serving as a scaﬀold of gene families into which users can
sort their genes of interest. We have devised search and
query tools that allow users to access this information,
making it possible to investigate the evolution of plant
genomes through analysis of the scaﬀold itself and
sequences sorted into the scaﬀold.
DATABASE PRODUCTION
Sequences were downloaded from each of the ﬁve
sequenced angiosperm species including 31 921 gene
models from A. thaliana (TAIR, version 7.0), 25 536
from C. papaya (version 1.0, complete), 40 567 from
M. trunculata (IMGA, version 1.0, 60% complete), 45 555
from P. trichocarpa (JGI, version 1.0) and 66 710 from
O. sativa (TIGR, version 5.0). The Carica and Medicago
genome-sequencing projects are underway; the data for
these species were included with the protein scaﬀold and
results for these species will go ‘live’ for public access
following the publication of these genomes. As summarized
in Figure 1, we compared the predicted proteins for all
ﬁve species in an all-against-all BLASTP (e=1e 10,
b=10000) using the NCBI BLAST package (7). MCL
clustering was then performed at low, medium and high
stringencies (Inﬂation, I=1.2, 3.0, 5.0, respectively) to
produce the sets of objectively deﬁned gene families (tribes).
A second iteration of MCL was conducted in order
to connect distant, but potentially related gene clusters
which we deﬁne as SuperTribes. In order to construct
SuperTribes, we computed both the average and minimum
e-value between all pairs of tribes and used these as the
input matrix for MCL. In addition, we ran MCL with low,
medium and high inﬂation values to generate SuperTribe
clusters at the three diﬀerent stringencies. In total, there

Figure 1. PlantTribes database production. Schematic diagram detailing the process of creating the PlantTribes database. External datasets are
indicated in green, ‘results’ in blue, and software in yellow. First, an all-against-all BLASTP of ﬁve sequenced plant genomes is conducted with the
results sent to MCL. Taxon abbreviations: Arath7 (Arabidopsis thaliana), Carpa (Carica papaya), Medtr1 (Medicago truncatula, currently 60%
complete), Orysa5 (Oryza sativa) and Poptr1 (Populus trichocarpa). Darker green for Carica and Medicago indicate that although these genomes were
included in the genome scaﬀold, tribe results for these species will not be accessible through the web interface of PlantTribes until the public release
of these genomes. Tribes are produced at low, medium and high stringencies and are annotated using Gene Ontology (GO), NCBI Conserved
Domain Database (CDD) and expression data from NASCArrays (EXP). A second round of MCL clustering is performed on all tribes to group
related tribes, called SuperTribes. For all tribes, protein and DNA alignments and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees using prap are generated.
Unigene sets from the TIGR Plant Transcriptome Assemblies are searched against the fully sequenced genomes and are automatically sorted into
respective tribes.

are 18 SuperTribe classiﬁcations for users to access and
compare (i.e. 3 original tribe stringencies 3 super tribe
stringencies 2 metrics average/minimum e-value).
In order to annotate each tribe, we used additional
information connected to all member genes according to
the following criteria: gene ontology (GO), presence of
domains, manually curated gene families and common
word patterns associated with the gene descriptions within
a tribe. We downloaded the gene_ontology.v1.2.obo,
goslim_plant.obo and gene_association.TAIR ﬂat ﬁles
(8) and used the map2slim.pl script to create a GO slim
database for the Arabidopsis genes in each tribe. To
annotate our tribes by domain information, we down-
loaded NCBI’s Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (9)
and used the formatrpsdb (default parameters, with
f=9.82, S=100.0) utility to index the domains. We
then searched all protein sequences from the ﬁve genomes
using rpsblast (default parameters, with e-value=1e 5).
To annotate tribes according to manually curated gene
families, we downloaded gene_family_tab_121906.txt
from TAIR, which includes 996 gene families that include
8331 genes. Finally, a Perl script was used to extract all
gene descriptions within a tribe, and determined the most
common words within the tribe, keeping track of the
relative position of each word, using only the top ﬁve
words. Therefore, each tribe has a composite annotation
deﬁned by each of the four criteria.
The resulting constellation of gene family tribes was used
as a scaﬀold for plant gene space onto which roughly
4 million unigene sequences were sorted. These unigenes,
derived from over 11 million ESTs, were downloaded from
TIGR PTA (http://plantta.tigr.org). In addition, we sorted
the predicted proteomes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
(green alga; JGI, version 3) and Physcomitrella patens
(moss; JGI, version 1). We searched the ﬁve sequenced
proteomes using a blastx search (e-value=1e 5) for
the unigene sequences and a blastp (e-value=1e 1)
search for the distantly related Physcomitrella and
Chlamydomonas proteomes.
Phylogenetic analysis pipeline
A sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis pipeline
included the following steps. We generated fasta ﬁles of
both amino acid and DNA sequences (CDS) for each
tribe. Each amino acid ﬁle was aligned using the
MUSCLE alignment program (10). We then forced the
DNA sequences onto the amino acid alignments using
custom Perl/Bioperl scripts.
Phylogenetic trees were built using a fast maximum-
likelihood ratchet approach (Morrison, D.A. (in press)
Increasing the eﬃciency of searches for the maximum
likelihood tree in a phylogenetic analysis of up to 150
nucleotide sequences. Syst. Biol., in press) as newly
implemented in PRAP (11) v.2.0 for this study. PRAP
generated command ﬁles that were handed over to PAUP
(12). The heuristics involves (i) rapidly getting a starting
tree not too far from the optimal score; (ii) move rapidly to
a (near-) optimal tree island, (iii) getting the best tree within
the island. Step (i) was achieved by calculating a BioNJ tree
using LogDet distances, followed by one round of NNI and
then one round of SPR branch swapping, optimizing the
substitution model parameters between these steps. Similar
to the parsimony ratchet (13), step (ii) included alternating
between branch swapping on the original matrix and
branch swapping on a matrix with 25% of characters
upweighted. Unlike in Nixon’s strategy for parsimony, SPR
branch swapping was used, only 10 iterations were
performed, and during the weighted analyses, only one
tree was saved. In particular for datasets with low levels of
phylogenetic signal, this strategy was found to be more
successful (Morrison, D.A. (in press, as above)) than the
strategies implemented in GARLI (14) or RAxML (15). To
assess conﬁdence in clades, bootstrapping was performed
by executing PRAP-generated command ﬁles in PAUP.
Using optimized parameters from the likelihood ratchet
search, SPR branch swapping was performed on the
maximum-likelihood topology for each bootstrapped data
matrix, and the proportion of iterations in which a given
clade was recovered was mapped onto the maximum-
likelihood tree using a strongly modiﬁed version of
TreeGraph (16) (Mu¨ller et al., manuscript in preparation).
The latter program was also used to generate SVG trees
that can be viewed via the web interface.
Understanding how gene expression patterns vary
among gene family members will inform our under-
standing of evolutionary processes shaping plant gene
function and genome structure. Characterization of
changing gene expression following gene duplication and
speciation events e.g. Ref. (17), will improve as additional
plant genomes are sequenced and genome-wide gene
expression studies are preformed on a wide range of
plant species (18). We aim to advance this research by
placing gene expression data within a gene family context.
To incorporate expression data into PlantTribes, we
downloaded all AFFY expression data and associated
descriptions of experiments, tissue, etc. from NASCArrays
(19). This has allowed us to link tribes with Arabidopsis
genes to a curated expression dataset including 327
experiments conducted on more than 200 tissues and
organs, developmental stages and growth conditions.
Gene expression data for additional species will be
added to future versions of PlantTribes, as an ontology
is developed to relate organs and developmental stages
across plant species (20–22).
PLANTTRIBES: DATA ACCESS AND RETRIEVAL
All output discussed in the previous section was loaded
into a MySQL database with user-searchable CGI scripts.
There are four main ways to search within the PlantTribes
Database (Figure 2): (i) using a gene ID or annotation
term for any of the Arabidopsis, rice, Populus,Medicago or
papaya gene models; (ii) using a CDD domain accession
ID, name or description; (iii) running a BLAST search on
a single sequence or ﬁle of user-supplied sequences or (iv)
querying the database of tribe characteristics. For
example, all tribes with a minimum and/or maximum
tribe size for each species or a threshold cumulative gene
number can be retrieved with a simple query. HTML
formatted search results include hyperlinks to sequence
information, domain content and the tribes represented by

each hit. All search results have links to the main page for
each tribe within the database. Each tribe page includes
the following information: uniﬁed annotation, stringency,
SuperTribe identiﬁer, the number of sequences from each
species, all CDD entries for each of the genes in the tribe,
a list of the genes in the tribe as well as each gene’s
tribe identiﬁer at low, medium and high stringency.
Tribe stability can be readily examined through compar-
ison of tribe membership at the diﬀerent stringencies.
Tools are also provided to view sequences from other
species that have been sorted into each tribe and to view
and/or download the sequences, alignments (constructed
at both protein and DNA level) and phylogenetic trees in
all major formats for each tribe.
THE UTILITY OF PLANTTRIBES FOR GENE
FAMILY ANALYSES
An important utility of PlantTribes is the ability to quickly
ﬁnd organism-speciﬁc tribes. In poplar (23), the ﬁrst
sequenced tree, we were able to use this feature to identify
tribes containing genes that are unique to that species
(among those with sequenced genomes; criteria were no
hits with e-values better than the 1.0E–10 threshold).
These genome-speciﬁc gene models were quite distinct
with no hits to any other sequences outside of their tribes.
Genes with similar sequences, however, were found in
the TIGR Plant Transcript Assembly database
(e-values< 1.0E–10 in tblastx searches), suggesting that
these may be expressed genes rather than annotation
artifacts. A similar experimental strategy can be adopted
to identify all organism-speciﬁc gene families as well as
gene families that have been lost in one or more lineages.
Beyond the insights gained from the comparisons of the
gene families, the PlantTribes database provides a useful
scaﬀold for sorting new sequences. For example, the
Floral Genome Project (24–26) has been sorting ESTs into
the putative gene families deﬁned by PlantTribes. Each
unigene is searched against the fully sequenced plant
proteomes using blastx, best hits are recorded and then

alignments, phylogenetic trees and microarray expression data.

used to tentatively place each unigene into a tribe. Further
evaluation of tribe membership is facilitated by reports for
each unigene showing the best hit(s) and the proportion of
genes within each tribe with signiﬁcant blast scores. This
process has allowed us to immediately produce classiﬁca-
tions of the genes we are ﬁnding in our EST data (25–29).
We have used the PlantTribes database to identify single
copy tribes (genes with just one member from each
species) whose memberships were stable across all three
stringencies (30). These shared single-copy genes are more
abundant than expected by chance, given the frequency of
single-copy genes that have resulted from gene death
following gene and genome duplication in these lineages in
Arabidopsis, rice and Poplar, (30). A similar strategy can
be used to produce a list of all of the tribes that are present
in only one of the species, i.e. tribes with zero genes in all
species but one. Identifying orthologs in EST sets from
several basal angiosperms has also allowed us to infer
lineage-speciﬁc substitution rate variation (31). The
database has also aided the identiﬁcation of paralogous
pairs to explore gene duplication through angiosperm
history (17) and assess the frequency of expression shifts
following gene duplication. In contrast, conserved gene
expression in some single-copy genes suggests conserved
function throughout angiosperm history (30).
PlantTribes circumscribes objectively deﬁned gene
families, but we need to assess the degree to which the
MCL clustering algorithm recovers evolutionary complete
gene family clades. Using the expansin and MADS-box
gene families as exemplars, we mapped tribe assignments
at low, medium and high stringencies onto previously
reported phylogenies for these two well-studied gene
families. We wanted to test the extent to which tribes
represent ‘putative’ gene families and investigate whether
large tribes recovered at low stringency typically break up
at higher stringencies into smaller tribes corresponding to
subfamilies. We tested whether there is a strict nested
relationship among tribes identiﬁed at low, medium and
high stringencies, and if so, whether the nested pattern of
relationships corresponds to the historical relationships
and past gene-duplication events as estimated in phyloge-
netic analyses. Figure 3A contains the mapping of tribe
membership from the three-way clustering to a phylogeny
of the expansin superfamily (32). All of the expansin genes
reported in the phylogeny from three expansin subfami-
lies, alpha, beta and expansin-like, are found in only one
tribe at low stringency. At medium stringency, the genes
are broken into two tribes with one tribe containing the
alpha and beta-expansins and the second tribe containing
the expansin-like genes. At the highest stringency, the
expansin-like alpha and expansin-like beta subfamilies are
split from the main tribe containing the alpha and beta
expansins.
It would be desirable for tribes to generally correspond
to monophyletic clades as was the case in the expansin
superfamily. This would allow investigators to download
and align sequences from a tribe with conﬁdence that all
genes in the alignment share a common ancestor and all
extant descendents of that ancestral gene are included in
the alignment. However, this is not always the case.
Figure 3B contains the mapping of tribe membership from
the three-way clustering to a well-accepted Arabidopsis
MADS-box gene family phylogeny (33). At higher
stringencies, small groups of related genes are peeled oﬀ
of the low-stringency clusters. As a consequence, the
largest tribe identiﬁed at high stringency is paraphyletic
with some divergent internal clades segregating into
distinct tribes. Whereas nearly all type-II MADS-box
genes were placed in a single tribe at low stringency, the
complete MADS-box gene family (including type-I) was
distributed among 14 tribes in the 5-species analysis. Even
though the tribes at three stringencies may not always
coincide with clades at each hierarchical level, the ability
of tribe and supertribe analyses to capture a large number
of related genes nevertheless provides an eﬃcient starting
point for investigations of gene and gene-family diversi-
ﬁcation across complete genomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The PlantTribes database oﬀers a unique and powerful
view of plant genomes and evolution. Collaborators
working on annotation and interpretation of gene
models for the Poplar and papaya genomes found the
tribe results to be an invaluable tool for gene family
identiﬁcation and annotation, and our results were high-
lighted in the recent Poplar genome sequence paper (23).
More than 15 other published articles to date have relied
on data extracted from PlantTribes including expression
divergence following gene duplication, identiﬁcation of
novel functional motifs, identiﬁcation of gene families for
intensive phylogenetic analysis and genome duplication
history of basal angiosperms. With many plant genome
sequence projects in progress, formal comparative
approaches such as PlantTribes will allow researchers to
rapidly identify the best gene models, quickly determine
errors in the initial annotations, identify new gene families
and increase the conﬁdence in the limits and structure of
existing gene families.
PlantTribes has been designed for ease of expansion and
feature addition. As new genomes are sequenced, or large
EST sets generated, PlantTribes will be continuously
expanded to include these data. New features being
developed presently include (i) a tool for the rapid
incorporation of new query sequences into tribe align-
ments and phylogenies, (ii) connecting the rapidly
expanding microRNA database into PlantTribes so that
genes that are putative targets of known or predicted
miRNAs may be easily found, (iii) expansion of the
microarray database to include large-scale array experi-
ments from basal angiosperms and other plants (26) that
will facilitate cross-species expression analyses and (iv)
synteny-based tools to map genome duplications onto
gene-family phylogenies. As the number of sequenced
genomes increases rapidly, the continued expansion of the
PlantTribes database will facilitate a multitude of genome
and gene-family studies, particularly homology-based
annotation, genome-scale analysis of multiple gene
families, characterization of large gene families and
subsets of genes with common domain architectures.

Figure 3. Tribes with expansin (A) and MADS box genes (B) formed at low, medium and high stringencies in the three-species clustering are mapped onto recently published gene phylogenies
(32,33). (A) In the Expansin phylogeny, all genes are found in a single tribe at low stringency. At medium stringency, the genes are broken up into two tribes separating expansin-like A subfamily
genes from all others expansin sub-families (tribe containing additional expansin-like genes not included in the original phylogeny). At high stringency, expansins are resolved as two tribes
corresponding to the sub-families alpha+beta and expansin-like. (B) The MADS box genes (including type I and II) included in the phylogeny are in two tribes with all genes in one tribe except
AGL49 and AGL50. At medium and high stringencies, well-deﬁned clades appear. The type I genes break up into many more tribes than type II genes, which is expected since type I genes are
more divergent among themselves. Within the type II genes, AGL65, AGL30, AGL94 are broken out from the main tribe, which is to be expected since this group of genes is highly divergent
type II genes.
