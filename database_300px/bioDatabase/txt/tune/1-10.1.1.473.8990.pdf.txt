Abstract
The NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO) gene family belongs to the ﬂavoprotein clan and, in the human genome, consists of
two genes (NQO1 and NQO2). These two genes encode cytosolic ﬂavoenzymes that catalyse the beneﬁcial two-electron reduction of
quinones to hydroquinones. This reaction prevents the unwanted one-electron reduction of quinones by other quinone reductases;
one-electron reduction results in the formation of reactive oxygen species, generated by redox cycling of semiquinones in the presence of
molecular oxygen. Both the mammalian NQO1 and NQO2 genes are upregulated as a part of the oxidative stress response and are inex-
plicably overexpressed in particular types of tumours. A non-synonymous mutation in the NQO1 gene, leading to absence of enzyme activity,
has been associated with an increased risk of myeloid leukaemia and other types of blood dyscrasia in workers exposed to benzene. NQO2
has a melatonin-binding site, which may explain the anti-oxidant role of melatonin. An ancient NQO3 subfamily exists in eubacteria and the
authors suggest that there should be additional divisions of the NQO family to include the NQO4 subfamily in fungi and NQO5 subfamily in
archaebacteria. Interestingly, no NQO genes could be identiﬁed in the worm, ﬂy, sea squirt or plants; because these taxa carry quinone
reductases capable of one- and two-electron reductions, there has been either convergent evolution or redundancy to account for the
appearance of these enzyme functions whenever they have been needed during evolution.

Introduction
Quinones comprise a large class of aromatic compounds,
found widely in plants, in the general (benzoyl) form of
C
6
H

O

, but also found in all organisms as ﬂavonoids,
electron-carrying coenzymes and metabolic end-products
of oxidation. Commercially, quinones are used in making dyes,
tanning hides and in photography. Quinones are potentially
dangerous, in that they can be involved in a one-electron
reduction to form semiquinones that will elicit oxidative stress
in any cell; benzoquinones and naphthoquinones are among
the most reactive in this category. Quinones were undoubtedly
present in the environment and in unicellular organisms
between 2 and more than 3 billion years ago (at the time
that partial pressure of ambient oxygen on the planet was
rising). Hence, during this time it is very likely there was a
strong selection to develop an enzyme that would reduce
quinones to hydroquinones by a two-electron step, thereby
avoiding free radical formation, which is highly destructive
to the living cell.
Background and history
The NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO)
gene family is therefore believed to be ancient — probably
between 2 and more than 3 billion years old. Cytosolic NQO
ﬂavoenzymes catalyse the beneﬁcial two-electron reduction of
quinones to hydroquinones. The two-electron reaction
prevents the reduction of quinones by one-electron reductases,
which would result in the formation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generated by redox cycling of semiquinones in the
presence of molecular oxygen.
1,2
In animals, in addition to the likely role in detoxication
of many dietary quinones derived from plants, NQO enzymes
have been shown to catalyse the reductive activation of
chemotherapeutic quinones such as mitomycins and aziridinyl-
benzoquinones.
3,4
The hydroquinones derived from these
agents appear to be chemically more reactive, either because
of rapid autoxidation or rearrangement — which, in either
case, will produce reactive species that can kill malignant
cells.

Discovery of DT diaphorase
Ernster and Navazio are credited with discovering (in the rat)
the ﬁrst member of the NQO family in the late 1950s.
7–9
This
enzyme is now ofﬁcially named NQO1 (EC 1.6.99.2; pre-
vious names included DT diaphorase and aminoazo dye
reductase, NQOR1, NMO1, NMOR1 and QR1). It was
later concluded
9,10
that this enzyme is probably identical to a
vitamin K reductase that had been isolated by Martius and
colleagues. The mammalian NQO1 enzyme is expressed
constitutively in most tissues and is strikingly upregulated
during oxidative or electrophilic stress; NQO1 has been
shown to be a member of the [AHR ] gene battery.
11
The
crystal structure,
12
enzymic functions
13
and polymorphisms
14
in the NQO1 gene have all recently been summarised.
The human NQO1 gene on chromosome 16q22.1
comprises six exons, spanning approximately 18 kilobases (kb),
encodes 274 amino acids and contains, to date, 93 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 10 kb 5
0
-ward of the
ﬁrst exon and 2 kb 3
0
-ward of the last exon (http://SNPper.
chip.org/). Two additional variants, besides the consensus
gene, were found in the Entrez Gene database (Figure 1).
Compared with the human consensus (reference, ‘wild-type’)
NQO1*1 allele coding for normal NQO1 enzyme and
activity, the NQO1*2 allele encodes a non-synonymous
mutation (Pro187Ser) that has negligible NQO1 enzyme
activity. The NQO1*2 allelic frequency ranges between
0.22 (Caucasian) and 0.45 (Asian) in various ethnic
populations. A large epidemiological investigation of a ben-
zene-exposed population
15
has shown that NQO1*2 homo-
zygotes exhibit as much as a seven-fold greater risk of bone
marrow toxicity, leading to diseases such as aplastic anaemia
and leukaemia. The NQO1*3 allele (Arg139Try) represents an
additional NQO1 polymorphism
16
that has been character-
ised; allelic frequencies have been reported as high as 0.05 in
some ethnic groups,
17
and the NQO1*3 allele has been linked
to a higher rate of exon 4 deletion — an alternatively spliced
form of NQO1 mRNA.
14
The other member
18,19
of this mammalian gene family is
NQO2, which has recently been demonstrated to be identical
to a protein isolated from human kidney in 1962. NQO2 is 43
residues shorter than NQO1 at its C-terminus and shows 49
per cent sequence identity with NQO1. The human NQO2
gene on chromosome 6p25.2 comprises seven exons (ﬁrst
exon non-coding) spanning 19.8 kb, encodes 231 amino acids
and contains, to date, 254 SNPs within 10 kb 5
0
-ward of the
ﬁrst exon and 2 kb 3
0
-ward of the last exon (http://SNPper.
chip.org/). Whereas earlier reports
20,21
had suggested an
association between both NQO1 and NQO2 polymorphisms
and Parkinson disease, a more recent study
22
showed no
association between alleles of either NQO1 or NQO2 and
Parkinson’s disease.
NQO1 efﬁciently utilises NAD(P)H as the source of redu-
cing equivalents, but — because the 43-amino acid deletion in
NQO2 contains a portion of the pyridine nucleotide binding
site — NQO2 has been shown to prefer dihydronicotinamide
ribosyl, and other similar derivatives, as a cofactor.
23
Similar to
NQO1, NQO2 can also bioactivate certain anti-tumour agents,
such as the CB1954 nitro compound.
13
A crystal structure of
human NQO2 has been published,
23
but not many biological
functions of this enzyme have so far been well characterised.
Curiously, NQO2 contains a melatonin-binding site,
24
which
might be a reasonable explanation for the anti-oxidant role
ascribed to melatonin.
Both NQO1 and NQO2 activities are observed at high
levels in many human solid tumours, including lung, colon,
liver and breast; this ﬁnding has encouraged oncologists to
explore the possibility of NQO1 and NQO2 as drug targets
for the development of novel anti-tumour agents that can be
activated by these enzymes.
13
Deﬁnition of ‘Pfam’ and ‘clan’
Pfam is a means of identifying similar domain structures of all
proteins that are summarised in UniProt (http://www.ebi.
uniprot.org/). Both NQO1 and NQO2 were found to belong

to the ﬂavodoxin-2 family (Pfam 02525) because they carry a
domain having a ﬂavodoxin-like fold.
The ﬂavodoxin-2 family is a member of the ﬂavoprotein
clan. Based on the Pfam database deﬁnition:
‘A clan contains two or more Pfam families that have arisen from a
single evolutionary origin. Evidence of their evolutionary relationship
is usually determined by similar tertiary structures or, when structures
are not available, by common sequence motifs.’
25
The category of ‘clans’ is thus usually introduced in order to
encompass two or more gene families that can be globally
quite distant evolutionarily but have some segment of the gene
products that show a high degree of similarity. Hence in a
BLAST search, a sequence may signiﬁcantly hit more than one
member of another family of the clan — as well as all members
within one family.
The ﬂavoprotein clan
The ﬂavoprotein clan includes four Pfam members: ﬂavo-
doxin-1, ﬂavodoxin-2, ﬂavodoxin NdrI and FMN red
(Table 1).
The ﬂavodoxin-1 family includes ﬂavodoxins and nitric
oxide synthases. Members of this clan are composed of
ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN)- or ﬂavin adenine dinucleo-
tide-binding redox proteins. Flavoproteins act in various
electron transport systems as functional analogues of ferre-
doxins; they are characterised by an open twisted alpha/beta
structure consisting of ﬁve parallel beta-sheets connected by
alpha-helices which surround the sheet. Flavodoxins are
electron-transfer proteins that function in various electron
transport systems. They bind one FMN molecule, which
serves as a redox-active prosthetic group, and are function-
ally interchangeable with ferredoxins. Flavodoxin genes are
found in prokaryotes, cyanobacteria and some eukaryotic
algae. Nitric oxide synthases (EC:1.14.13.39) produce nitric
oxide from L-arginine and NADPH. Nitric oxide acts as a
second messenger signalling molecule in the body. Five
NOS genes have been found in the human genome: NOS1
(neuronal); NOS2A (hepatocyte inducible); NOS2B;
NOS2C; and NOS3 (endothelial cell)
(http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/).
The ﬂavodoxin-2 family includes bacterial and eukaryotic
NAD(P)H:quinone reductases (as described above), as well
as the bacterial acyl carrier protein (ACP), phosphodiesterase
(EC:3.1.4.14). The acyl carrier enzyme converts the
holo-ACP into apo-ACP by catalysing the hydrolysis of the
phosphodiester linkage between Ser-36 of ACP and the
4
0
-phosphopantethein prosthetic group. ACP is a small
(8.8 kDa) protein that plays a central role in the biosynthesis
of fatty acids in bacteria, plant chloroplasts and other
organisms. ACP phosphodiesterase is known to be encoded
by the acpD gene in Escherichia coli and has been widely
distributed in other bacteria, including Azospirillum brasilense,
Bacillus halodurans, B. stearothermophilus, B. subtilis, Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae, Lactococcus lactis, Mesorhizobium loti, Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptomyces coelicolor.
The ﬂavodoxin_NdrI family contains ribonucleotide
reductases, which are a family of complex enzymes that play
an essential role in all organisms. These enzymes catalyse de
novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA
replication and repair.
26
Finally, members of the FMN red family (ﬂavin reductases)
use ﬂavins as substrates and are distinct from ﬂavoenzymes,
which have tightly bound ﬂavins. The reduced ﬂavin can serve to
provide electrons for ferric ion complexes and iron proteins. In
E. coli, reactivation of ribonucleotide reductase is achieved by the
formation of reduced ﬂavins by ﬂavin reductase.
Previous confusion about NQO
genes and diaphorases
Much of the confusion that has arisen with the nomenclature
of NQO1, NQO2 and related proteins can be traced back to
the widespread use of the term ‘diaphorase’ in enzymatic
studies more than 50 years ago. In fact, this terminology is still
being carried forward.
27
The term ‘diaphorase’ has generally
been used to describe a ‘coenzyme’ (often a ﬂavoprotein)
that can transfer electrons from reduced pyridine nucleotides
to electron acceptors.

q HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS 1473-9542. HUMAN GENOMICS . VOL 2. NO 5. 329–335 MARCH 2006 331
there are many enzymes that can be characterised as
‘diaphorases’.
The term ‘DT’-diaphorase was originally used by Ernster,
to describe what is now known as NQO1, because the
enzyme worked with equal facility, employing either DPNH
(NADH) or TPNH (NADPH). Edwards et al.
29
discuss a
series of ‘diaphorases’ deﬁned in human tissues. Diaphorase-1
was NADH cytochrome b5 reductase-3 (Table 2).
30,31
Diaphorase-2 was the major enzyme in erythrocytes catalysing
the oxidation of NADPH. Diaphorase-3 was the principal
source of oxidised coenzyme in sperm. Diaphorase-4 was
characterised by Edwards et al.,
29
and this enzyme was
found to be identical to the previously characterised
DT-diaphorase.
32
Interestingly, Edwards and colleagues also
showed that diaphorase-4 activity was absent in approximately
4 per cent of the UK population, which is in agreement with
more recent genetic studies of the prevalence of the null
NQO1*2 allele.
14
.
All diaphorases discussed by Edwards
29
are distinct gene
products but, because of their similarity based on enzymic
function rather than evolutionary divergence, searches for
‘NQO1’ in some databases will still return descriptions of
‘cytochrome b5 reductase’. These cytochrome b5 reductase
‘diaphorases’ are not evolutionarily related, are very different
functionally and are encoded by separate gene loci (Table 2).
A second source of confusion involves the use of the generic
term ‘quinone reductase’, because a wide variety of enzymes
in prokaryotes, plants and animals can reduce quinones via
both one- and two-electron steps.
A search of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee
database using ‘NQO’ provided three hits—two NQO genes
plus ‘NQO3A2’ (which actually encodes cytochrome b5
reductase-1)—the latter appears in the database because of its
previous name as a diaphorase (see above). In fact, one of its
aliases is ‘NQO3A2’, which has been listed in the http://
SNPper.chip.org/ database; the authors have pointed out this
error to this organisation. A search of the SwissProt and
TrEMBL databases using ‘NQO’ provided 168 hits (39 in
SwissProt and 129 in TrEMBL), but not all of them belong to
the ﬂavodoxin-2 family. The term ‘NQO’ has therefore been
used for other enzymes and care should be taken to avoid
such confusion.

Update of the NQO gene family ReviewUPDATE ON GENE COMPLETIONS AND ANNOTATIONS
Evolutionary divergence of
the NQO genes
Figure 2 shows the evolutionary relatedness of a number of
selected NQO gene products from mammals, birds, amphi-
bians, ﬁsh, fungi and bacteria. Vertebrates carry the NQO1
and NQO2 genes while eubacteria carry the most ancient
NQO3 genes. The authors suggest naming the fungal sub-
family as NQO4 and the archaebacterial subfamily as NQO5.
Four plants (bottom of Figure 2) are complete outliers, being
members of the ﬂavodoxin-1 quinone reductase family.
Curiously, it was found that frog, zebraﬁsh and puffer ﬁsh have
NQO1 but not NQO2; conversely, chicken and ray-ﬁnned
ﬁsh have NQO2 but not NQO1. Whether the other hom-
ologous gene will be found in any of these genomes in the
future remains to be determined. Undoubtedly, the NQO1
and NQO2 genes in vertebrates arose from the prokaryotic
NQO3 ancestor. Fungal NQO4 genes also arose from bacterial
NQO3, however it is impossible to say whether the eubac-
terial NQO3 genes or the archaebacterial NQO5 genes rep-
resent the original ancestor. One prokaryotic taxon might
have captured the gene from the other prokaryotic taxon by
horizontal gene transfer.
The authors performed a series of BLAST searches — using
NQO1, NQO2 or NQO3 sequences — and no homologous
protein of signiﬁcance inCiona intestinalis,Caenorhabditis elegans,
Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Oryza sativa (rice) or
Arabidopsis thaliana was detected. Wheat plants have been
reported to show quinone reductase activity (both the one- and
two-electron reductase forms), however, induced in response to
powdery mildew infection;
33
infection and inﬂammation are
known to be processes that induce oxidative stress.
11
Plants
appear to utilise quinone reductase by way of evolutionarily
unrelated classes of quinone oxidoreductases, carrying out both
one- and two-electron reduction reactions,
34
and also alternative
NAD(P)Hdehydrogenases.
35
This ﬁndingmight therefore be an
example of convergent evolution: Mother Nature needed a
particular enzyme in a particular location within the plant cell,
did not have NQO enzymes in this phylum and therefore
selected another type of quinone oxidoreductase or an alterna-
tive NAD(P)H dehydrogenase to carry out the enzymic func-
tion. Alternatively, this ﬁnding might be an example of
redundancy, in which multiple systems have evolved indepen-
dently to face a particular selective pressure.
Do plants suffer from oxidative stress? The absence of NQO
genes in plants might reﬂect the fact that plants use carbon
dioxide rather than molecular oxygen; therefore, plants may
not experience oxidative stress in the way animals do. This is a
fascinating bit of speculation that may be worthy of further
study. The putative plant NQO equivalents (QR1, QR2)
contain the ﬂavodoxin-1 domain and belong to the ﬂavo-
doxin-1 family. This domain is found in a number of
proteins, including ﬂavodoxin and nitric oxide synthase
(as described above).
Putative role of NQO in oxidative
stress
BCL2 is well known to be anti-apoptotic and therefore
prevents apoptosis from proceeding.
36
Proposed functions of
BCL2 include mediation of ROS levels and the redox status
of the cell, prevention of nucleocytoplasmic trafﬁcking of
TRP53 and other cell cycle regulatory factors, neutralisation
of BAX, BAD and other proteins that heterodimerise and
promote apoptosis and deterrence of mitochondrial cyto-
chrome c release.
37–39
The C. elegans cell death-9 (ced-9) gene
is the homologue of the mammalian BCL2 gene, ced-9 is part
of a polycistronic locus in C. elegans that includes the cyt-1
gene encoding a protein similar to cytochrome b
560
.
38
Cytochrome b
560
is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein
involved in system II (succinate dehydrogenase), which
transfers an electron from succinate to ubiquinone. Interest-
ingly, this dehydrogenase has been described as a member
of the NQO gene superfamily;
40
however, the authors found
that cytochrome b
560
is instead a member of the more
expansive ﬂavodoxin-1 family (described above). They suggest
that various members of the ﬂavoprotein clan, including
mammalian NQO1, probably participate in aiding the cell in
preventing unwanted apoptosis.
40,41
Concluding remarks
Isolation and characterisation of a cytosolic enzyme in several
rat tissues in the 1950s led to the description of a
quinone reductase in at least two independent laboratories.
A substantial number of publications, calling this enzyme ‘DT-
diaphorase’, has led to confusion about the evolutionary
relatedness of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases to
one another. There are two NQO genes in vertebrates, a
homologous NQO3 subfamily of genes in eubacteria, a
NQO4 subfamily in fungi and a NQO5 gene subfamily in
archaebacteria. The fascinating functions of the human
NQO1 enzyme include protection against myeloid leukaemia
and other types of leukaemia in workers exposed to benzene
and a possible anti-apoptotic role fundamental to the cell
cycle. NQO2 appears to participate in the anti-oxidant
properties of melatonin. Although many SNPs exist in the
human NQO2 gene, little is known about any association with
a physiological disorder or protection against environmental
toxicants.
