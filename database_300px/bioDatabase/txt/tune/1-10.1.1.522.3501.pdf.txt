ABSTRACT.   In an evaluation of diatoms as indicators of human disturbance in coastal ecosystems of
the Laurentian Great Lakes, we characterized assemblage specificity to lake and habitat type to identify
non-anthropogenic factors influencing indicator models. Surface sediment assemblages and environmen-
tal variables were collected along the U.S. coastline at 191 sample sites, which were classified by lake
and geomorphic type: high-energy (HE), embayment (EB), coastal wetland (CW), riverine wetland (RW),
protected wetland (PW), and open water (OP). Diatom inferred (DI) total phosphorus (TP) transfer func-
tions (models) were developed for each lake and geomorphic type. Robust models included: the overall
model (RMSEP; r2jack = 0.65; RMSEP = 0.005), Lake Superior (r2jack = 0.73; RMSEP = 0.003), Lake
Ontario (r2jack = 0.73; RMSEP = 0.007), PW (r2jack = 0.64; RMSEP = 0.003), and EB (r2jack = 0.64;
RMSEP = 0.007). Weaker models, indicating poorer diatom-TP relationships, included: RW (r2jack =
0.03; RMSEP = 0.005), OP (r2jack = 0.15; RMSEP = 0.059), and Lake Michigan (r2jack = 0.38; RMSEP =
0.006). DI TP data were regressed against landscape characteristics to quantify the relationships to
adjacent watershed stressors. RW data were further scrutinized as a case study to investigate the suitabil-
ity of diatom-based approaches in systems with poor diatom-TP relationships. Despite poor performance
of the RW model, DI phosphorus data for riverine wetlands, derived from the overall model, were
strongly related to watershed characteristics (r2 = 0.61), indicating the overall model’s ability to inte-
grate stressors from the surrounding watershed in areas where measured phosphorus did not adequately
characterize prevailing conditions. This study confirms that physical properties (e.g., lake or habitat
type) can influence indicator models; however, weaknesses may be overcome by robust calibration tech-
niques.

Diatom Models and Geomorphic Variability 137
INTRODUCTION
Readily accessible monitoring data are essential
to assess conditions, prioritize research, and evalu-
ate effectiveness of current policies (Messer et al.
1991). Water chemistry is frequently used as a
water quality indicator, but snapshot measurements
may not reflect the prevailing conditions in an area
(Detenbeck et al. 1996, Bradshaw et al. 2002). Bio-
logical indicators are often chosen as indicators of
condition and change in freshwater systems because
they integrate environmental conditions over time
(Yoder and Rankin 1998). For example, diatoms
(Dixit et al. 1992), fish communities (Brazner
1997, Rahel 2000), wetland vegetation (Herdendorf
1992), birds (Robinson et al. 1995), and amphibians
(Kutka and Bachman 1990) have been used to as-
sess impacts from stressors. The U.S. Environmen-
tal Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Science to
Achieve Results program established the Estuarine
and Great Lakes (EaGLe) research program with a
major goal of developing new approaches to assess
environmental condition (Niemi and McDonald
2004, Niemi et al. 2004). One of the EaGLe pro-
jects, the Great Lakes Environmental Indicators
(GLEI: https://glei.nrri.umn.edu) project, was
specifically designed to develop indicators for the
Laurentian Great Lakes. This paper focuses on the
diatom algae; other groups worked with fish, birds,
amphibians, benthic macroinvertebrates, and sedi-
ment contaminants. 
Diatom algae are powerful tools for inferring en-
vironmental variables. Diatoms are especially well
suited for environmental inferences for several rea-
sons: as primary producers they integrate and corre-
late well with ambient water quality conditions,
they possess a rapid turnover rate and therefore a
short response time to environmental change (Vine-
brooke 1996), they have numerous species with a
range of tolerances to various environmental mea-
sures (Patrick and Reimer 1966a, b; Werner 1977;
Round et al. 1990), and they manufacture siliceous
cell walls that leave floristic fossils (Hall and Smol
1999). Diatoms have been used to reveal past lake
conditions (Hall and Smol 1992, Fritz et al. 1993,
Bennion 1994, Reavie and Smol 1997) as an instru-
ment for investigating climate change (Gregory-
Eaves et al. 1999) and as monitors of present day
conditions (Reavie and Smol 1998a, Ramstack et
al. 2003).
Phosphorus is a proxy of cultural eutrophication
(Vollenweider 1968, Dillon and Rigler 1975) and
has been used to characterize trophic gradients
(Hustedt 1939). Diatoms are a natural choice for as-
sessing environmental condition in freshwater sys-
tems that are potentially impacted by cultural
eutrophication, due to the clear responses they have
to phosphorus conditions (Dixit and Smol 1994).
Many diatom inferred (DI) phosphorus models
(also known as transfer functions) have been devel-
oped and illustrate this strong relationship to phos-
phorus concentration (e.g., Hall and Smol 1992,
Bennion 1994, Reavie and Smol 1998a, Ramstack
et al. 2003). Indeed, phosphorus has already been
identified as an important chemical influencing the
diatoms from the nearshore Laurentian Great Lakes
(Reavie et al. 2006). The basin-wide diatom-based
transfer function developed from various coastal
habitats across the Great Lakes (Reavie et al. 2006)
would be useful to researchers and lake managers
working anywhere in the nearshore system. How-
ever, the lakes are physically and chemically vari-
able and there are distinct habitats with unique
properties within each lake. For example, Lake
Huron is classified as an oligotrophic lake, although
some areas in the lake have historically ranged from
eutrophic to ultra-oligotrophic (Vollenweider et al.
1974). Additionally, there are differences in benthic
diatom assemblages within and between lakes (Sto-
ermer 1975, 1998). Furthermore, geographic gradi-
ents are known to confound diatom-based transfer
functions and overwhelm the biological-water qual-
ity relationship used to develop indicator models
(Potapova and Charles 2002).
It has been recommended that more studies con-
centrate on the dominant features of the coastal
zone of the Great Lakes to investigate the relation-
ship of geomorphology and hydrology on organ-
isms and processes (Keough et al. 1999). A better
understanding of these and other non-anthropogenic
factors helps to better distinguish natural variability
from stressor-influenced variability (Smith 1998).
The present study design enabled us to obtain a
large sample size specifically targeting six pre-de-
fined geomorphic types across all five Great Lakes
to develop indicators. This study uses data from an
existing Great Lakes coastal inference model
(Reavie et al. 2006). Here our goal was to investi-
gate the effects of these geomorphological and geo-
graphical properties on diatom-based phosphorus
models, and to find whether specific geomorphic
types or lakes were less amenable to developing
phosphorus transfer functions (i.e., inference mod-
els). 
Comparing diatom-inferred water quality to mea-
sured water quality is an established method used to
138 Kireta et al.
determine model robustness. Additionally, by com-
paring DI measures to adjacent landscape character-
istics, we can quantify the ability of diatom
assemblages to detect upland stressor influences.
The previous study, which used a basin-wide
model, demonstrated how DI water quality had a
stronger relationship with landscape stressors than
snapshot measures of water quality (Reavie et al.
2006). Landscape stressor data provide a means to
assess inference models and relate indicator organ-
isms to perturbations on the surrounding landscape.
Hence, we also sought to investigate the relation-
ship between landscape stressors and DI phospho-
rus from individual habitat and lake models, and in
doing so further evaluate diatom transfer function
performance. Furthermore, the present study ex-
panded the Reavie et al. (2006) dataset to determine
the effect of including offshore samples in the di-
atom transfer function. 
The major goals of this study were to: 1) deter-
mine the specificity of diatom assemblages and en-
vironmental variables to each of the five Great
Lakes and each of the six coastal region geomor-
phic types, 2) determine whether we can consis-
tently develop robust transfer functions within these
11 subgroups, and if not, 3) identify which natural
factors weaken diatom indicator models and recom-
mend approaches to resolve these weaknesses. 
METHODS
Study Area
A detailed explanation of the GLEI study design
is given by Danz et al. (2005). Briefly, sites were
randomly selected across natural and anthropogenic
gradients in all five Great Lakes in two eco-
provinces; the southerly, warmer Eastern Broadleaf
Forest and the more northerly Laurentian Mixed
Forest (Keys et al. 1995). The U.S. coast of the
Great Lakes was divided into 762 “segment-sheds”
defined as the area draining to a shoreline segment
beginning and ending halfway between second
order streams. The sampling area covered the U.S.
side of Lakes Superior (SU), Michigan (MI), Huron
(HU), Erie (ER), and Ontario (ON) from Silver
Bay, Minnesota to Bedford Corners, New York. Site
characterization was performed at a segment-shed
level using landscape characteristics, including po-
tential stressor variables, from various geographical
information system (GIS) sources. A subset of sites
was selected which maximized the coverage of nat-
ural (e.g., habitat and soil types) and anthropogenic
(e.g., urban and agricultural development) gradients
across the basin (Danz et al. 2005).
Diatom and water quality samples were collected
at 191 sites (Fig. 1) in six types of coastal ecosys-
tems characterized by hydrogeomorphic features:
high-energy (HE), embayment (EB), coastal wet-
land (CW), riverine wetland (RW), protected wet-
land (PW), and open water (OP). Figure 2
represents a conceptual model of our geomorphic
types, revised and expanded from Keough et al.
(1999). Five of these geomorphic types involved
sampling less than 1 km from shore, typically at a
depth of 0.5 m, and were classified as nearshore
(HE, EB, CW, RW, and PW), and a sixth geomor-
phic type, OP, was sampled farther from shore and
was considered an offshore habitat. All six geomor-
phic types were categorized in the present study as
“coastal” since they were within 5 km of shore.
Grouping of the “nearshore” sites was used to sim-
plify referral to the five shallow habitats. The inclu-
sion of the offshore (OP) samples is unique to other
GLEI analyses published thus far and was under-
taken to investigate the inclusion of these deeper
samples with the nearshore model (Reavie et al.
2006). HE sites were defined as exposed shoreline
that did not support vegetation and were subjected
to wind and wave energy. EB sites were at least one
square kilometer, had a reduced exposure to wind
and wave energy, contained no more than one
smaller bay, and had a bay opening that was smaller
than the distance from the open lake to the inner-
most bay section. CW sites were found in open
coastlines and relatively open bays. These were ex-
posed wetlands vulnerable to the most wind and
wave energy of the three wetland types. RW sites
were influenced by a second order or higher river,
had a surface water connection to the lake, and were
somewhat protected from wind and wave action.
PW sites were least disturbed by wind and wave en-
ergy. They were behind a sand-spit or other land
barrier, were characterized by high sedimentation
and may have had a surface water connection. De-
tailed characteristics of the three wetland types are
given by Keough et al. (1999). Our best judgment
was used to accurately categorize nearshore sam-
pling sites, as there were a few instances where a
sample location had characteristics of more than
one geomorphic type. OP sites were deeper, open-
water habitats sampled 3 to 5 km from shore where
the water column was approximately 30 m deep.
OP sites were also collected along the landscape
stressor gradient, with a goal of selecting four to
five locations within each lake.

Field Sampling
Field data were collected from nearshore sites
from 9 Jun. through 18 Sept. in 2002, and from 22
May through 10 Aug. in 2003. OP samples and
chemistry were collected by the U.S. EPA Mid-Con-
tinent Ecology Division (MED) from 7 Aug. through
11 Sept. in 2002, and 11 Jun. through 9 Sept. in 2003
using the research vessel Lake Explorer
(http://www.epa.gov/facilities_network/lakeexplorer.
html).
A motorboat or canoe was used to sample each
nearshore site based on ease of access. Field mea-
surements or samples were collected for: dissolved
oxygen (DO), pH, specific conductance, total sus-
pended solids (TSS), chlorophyll a (chl a), fluores-
cence, turbidity, chloride, dissolved organic carbon
(DOC), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN),
nitrate/nitrite [(NO2+NO3)-N], and ammonia (NH4-
N). Water sample processing for nearshore samples
occurred within 24 hours at temporary labs set up
near field locations. A Turner Designs Aquafluor™
was used to determine fluorescence and turbidity at
the time of sample processing. Raw water samples
were analyzed for both turbidity and fluorescence,
and filtered samples for background fluorescence,
each reading performed twice. A replicate sample,
blank, turbidity calibration standard, and solid fluo-
rescence standard were also analyzed every ten
samples. TN, TP, (NO2+NO3)-N, NH4-N, color, and
chloride were later analyzed using standard meth-
ods (Ameel et al. 1998, APHA 2000) at University
of Minnesota Duluth’s Natural Resources Research

type within 10 km of each other were pared down for visualization. 
140 Kireta et al.
Institute (NRRI). DOC was analyzed by UV-persul-
fate/IR absorption (APHA 2000) at the EPA-MED
water quality laboratory (Duluth, MN).
Samples were processed (filtered, preserved,
iced, or frozen) at temporary labs in the field within
24 hours. TSS was later determined gravimetrically
at the collector’s institution (NRRI’s Ely Field Sta-
tion or John Carroll University). Chlorophyll-a
(ppb) and phaeophytin-a (ppb) were analyzed at
NRRI. 
Alkalinity was analyzed within 24 hours of sam-
ple collection by acid titration to endpoint pH 4.5,
unless the initial pH was greater than 8.3, in which
case 8.3 was the first of two endpoints. Reavie et al.
(2006) provide complete additional details on
chemistry methods and references used in this in-
vestigation. 
For nearshore samples, diatoms were collected
from sediment with a 6.5 cm diameter push core
(approximately 75% of samples). The entire top 1
cm of sediment was carefully removed with a putty
knife, spoon, and/or large pipette. A Ponar sampler
was used to obtain sediment and the top 1 cm was
collected whenever a core was not possible. Rock
or wood was collected and scraped with a knife or
scrubbed clean with a small brush into a container
to collect attached algae when other collection
methods were not possible. Diatom samples were
refrigerated until processing. Field replicates of di-
atom and water samples were taken for 10% of
samples. 
Water was collected from 8 L Niskin bottles on a
rosette sampler near the water’s surface for OP
water quality measures. Measures included all those
performed for nearshore samples except for phaeo-
phytin-a, alkalinity, color, and turbidity. Benthic
diatom samples were preferably collected with a 
6.5 cm diameter gravity corer, but the top of a
Ponar sample was obtained when a core was not
possible, which occurred in many instances due to
hard substrates. U.S. EPA-MED performed all
water quality analyses on open-water samples fol-
lowing standard methods that were virtually identi-
cal to those used for the nearshore samples
analyzed by NRRI-UMD.
Diatom Preparation
Diatom sub-samples were taken from sediment
samples that were homogenized by hand mixing.
Diatom frustules were cleaned using one of the fol-
lowing digestion methods: strong acid (concen-
trated nitric or hydrochloric acid) and boiling, or by
using 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in either a
warm water bath (~78°C) or with potassium dichro-
mate (K2Cr2O7) as a catalyst. Larger sub-samples
were processed using approximately 10 g wet sedi-
ment and 100 mL 30% H2O2 with ~0.2 g catalyst in
1 L beakers. Smaller sub-samples (~0.2 g wet sedi-
ment) were prepared in 20 mL borosilicate glass
scintillation vials with ~15 mL 30% H2O2, using a
water bath to heat samples. Another digestion
method used approximately 20–30 ml of strong
acid in beakers with 1 g of sediment that had been
dried on low heat for 24 hours. Samples were rinsed
at least five times for all methods, using a cen-
trifuge, or by settling overnight, followed by aspira-

tion of the supernatant. Remaining, undigested sam-
ple material was freeze-dried for preservation and is
stored at NRRI’s field station in Ely, Minnesota. 
Slides were prepared by pouring a sub-sample of
diatom slurry and deionized water over four circu-
lar 18 mm coverslips in a Battarbee settling tray
(Battarbee 1986). Dried coverslips were mounted
on slides using a mountant with a high refractive
index, either Pleurax (refractive index ~1.7+) or
Naphrax (refractive index ~1.65+). One slide was
used per count, slide transects were recorded, and
every diatom valve that was more than 50% in the
field of view and with more than 50% of the valve
intact was enumerated, with a goal of 400 valves
per sample. A small percentage of samples had very
sparse diatom assemblages, so considering logistic
constraints we enumerated to the highest feasible
number. In most instances, over 350 valves were
counted per sample with the exception of OP sam-
ples, which had notably sparser diatom density, in
which case over 300 valves were usually counted.
The following references were employed to assist
in taxonomic identification: Krammer and Lange-
Bertalot (1986-1991), Stoermer et al. (1999),
Patrick and Reimer (1966a, b), Reavie and Smol
(1998b), Cumming et al. (1995), and Camburn et
al. (1984-1986). Taxonomic meetings were held to
ensure harmony of identifications among different
taxonomists (Reavie et al. 2006). In addition to the
field replicates, slide count (a minimum of 10% of
samples), temporal, and spatial replicates were as-
sessed. Field and slide count replicates were later
combined for analyses in this paper. Temporal repli-
cates were treated as unique samples and repre-
sented 8% of total samples (10% of nearshore
samples). Spatial replicates had unique chemistry
for most measures and were independently ana-
lyzed at 5% of sample locations.
Data Analyses
Unique sampling events with associated diatom
and chemical data were used in analyses. Raw
counts of taxa were transformed into percent (rela-
tive) abundance. Taxa were defined as non-rare and
included in all further analyses if they occurred in
at least five samples and represented at least 1%
relative abundance in one or more samples, or if
they represented at least 5% relative abundance in
at least one sample. Site diatom assemblages and
environmental profiles underwent outlier analysis
as described in Reavie et al. (2006); no outliers
were identified. Some taxa were combined into
“complexes” of similar taxa, which may have been
categorized differently by separate taxonomists
(i.e. , Achnanthidium biasolettiana (Grunow)
Bukhtiyarova, Achnanthidium minutissimum
(Kütz.) Czarnecki, Cyclotella comensis Grunow,
Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenb.) D.M. Williams and
Round, and Tabellaria flocculosa (Roth) Kützing).
Preliminary analysis using detrended correspon-
dence analysis on our species data produced a gra-
dient length of 4.7 standard deviation units,
suggesting unimodal analysis methods were most
appropriate for these data (ter Braak and S „milauer
2002).
We carried out correspondence analysis (CA)
using Canoco 4.5 (ter Braak and S „milauer 2002) to
visualize variation in the diatom assemblages and to
develop scores for testing differences among the
sample subgroups. We used scaling focused on
inter-species distances, applying downweighting of
rare species. Species ordinations were initially per-
formed on the entire set of samples (N = 191). Pre-
liminary analyses showed strong species differences
between the OP and the collective nearshore sites,
so exploratory analyses were also performed on
nearshore sites alone to better reveal variability
within these data. 
We carried out principal components analysis
(PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our water
quality measures to visualize and test environmen-
tal patterns among geomorphic types and lakes.
Water chemistry variables were transformed (e.g.,
log(x + 1) or square root (x+1)) when necessary to
obtain or approximate normal distribution and to re-
duce the influence of outliers (see Reavie et al.
2006 for transformation details). Variables included
in the analysis were: DO, pH, conductivity, TSS,
chlorophyll a, fluorescence, chloride, DOC, TP,
TN, (NO2+NO3)-N, and NH4-N. Scaling was fo-
cused on inter-variable correlation, variable scores
were divided by the variable’s standard deviation
(sd) after extraction of the axes, and centering and
standardization were carried out on the correlation
matrix. Like the species data, PCA was performed
on the complete sample set (N = 191) and subse-
quently on the nearshore samples (N = 155), be-
cause the OP samples exhibited distinct
environmental characteristics.
We tested for statistical differences in species as-
semblages and water chemistry among sites using
2-way multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA; SAS Institute 2003). There were two
tests, one using the first two CA axes (species as-
semblages) as dependent variables and one using
142 Kireta et al.
the first two PCA axes (water chemistry) as depen-
dent variables. Lake identity and geomorphic type
were the two main effects (independent variables)
in both tests. We carried out multiple comparisons
between all pairs of lakes and all pairs of geomor-
phic types using CONTRAST statements (P < 0.05
with Bonferroni correction; SAS Institute, 2003).
CA scores were first log transformed (log (x+1))
because preliminary analysis on raw scores yielded
high residuals resulting from skewness. 
Models
C2 software (Juggins 2003) was used to develop
models using the total (omnibus) training set (i.e.,
set of sample locations) and lake- and geomorphic
type-specific training sets. C2 uses the training set
to calculate optima and tolerances for each taxon to
a selected environmental variable. In the model in-
ference step, weighted averages of the species op-
tima are used to calculate the inferred value for an
assemblage, with optional downweighting by the
species tolerance coefficients (Birks et al. 1994). To
test a model’s ability to infer the selected variable,
C2 compares observed to diatom-inferred values for
each training set sample. The strength of a model is
denoted by the squared correlation coefficient (r2)
and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the ob-
served-inferred comparison for the calculated vari-
able. A leave-one-out cross-validation technique
called jackknifing is used to avoid circularity by in-
dependently estimating environmental data (Juggins
2003). The power of the jackknifed model is de-
noted by r2jack and model error is calculated as root
mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). Compar-
isons of RMSEP could not be directly made among
the various models we developed because the range
of measured total phosphorus differed among geo-
morphic type and lake training sets. To standardize
each RMSEP value, it was divided by the standard
deviation of measured total phosphorus from the
corresponding model training set. In general, mod-
els with higher r2jack values and lower standardized
RMSEP values were considered more robust. Maxi-
mum and average bias data were also evaluated,
lower bias reflecting less prediction error. Maxi-
mum bias data were divided by the range of model
input data to provide a percent maximum bias. Av-
erage bias values were consistently less than
10–16% of the range of measured data in each
model, so these data are not presented.
Total phosphorus was the environmental variable
used for model evaluation since phosphorus is asso-
ciated with cultural eutrophication and was most
the influential chemical variable explaining varia-
tion in the diatom assemblage data (Reavie et al.
2006). Total phosphorus models were developed
for: (A) all samples (the omnibus training set), (B)
each lake, and (C) each geomorphic type. The om-
nibus model included all lakes and geomorphic
types comprising 191 samples and 380 taxa. A
nearshore model (excluding OP samples) was also
developed based on preliminary evidence that these
samples had very different water quality and
species characteristics from the nearshore environ-
ments (155 training set samples, 372 taxa). A model
was also created excluding RW samples based on
apparent poor transfer function performance of this
geomorphic type, and riverine wetland DI TP was
independently reconstructed using C2 software
(Juggins 2003). Weighted averaging with classical
deshrinking (C2 software; Juggins 2003) was the
chosen method for all models, based on preliminary
evaluations of model performance. 
Multiple Linear Regression
with Landscape Stressors
Landscape data were created from landscape and
soil characteristics summarized in a previous study
(Danz et al. 2007). Landscape stressor data were
characterized adjacent to each wetland site sampled
(N=109) and were used to evaluate the relationship
between watershed characteristics and both mea-
sured and DI TP for the three wetland types. Asso-
ciated landscape data for OP, HE, and EB sites were
unavailable at the time of analyses; this subset of
wetland watershed characteristics is consistent with
Reavie et al. (2006). Analyses were expanded in the
current study to evaluate the effect of inclusion of
offshore (OP) sites in the inference model. A poly-
gon “complex” for sampling events was drawn
around each GLEI wetland sampling area, and a
watershed contributing area to each complex was
determined by using GIS-based elevation models
(Hollenhorst et al. 2007 this issue). Effort was
taken to ensure best boundary placement for com-
plex characterization and included sampling events
from other GLEI subcomponents when appropriate. 
ArcView (GIS; ESRI 1996) was used to summa-
rize over 200 environmental variables from seven
categories: agriculture, atmospheric deposition,
land use and land cover, human population density
and development, point and non-point source pollu-
tion, shoreline modification, and soils. The first six
categories represent anthropogenic disturbances,
Diatom Models and Geomorphic Variability 143
while the soils category represents a landscape
characteristic important to physical and chemical
water quality measures. PCA was performed on the
datasets for each of these seven environmental cate-
gories to reduce the dimensionality and to establish
principal component (PC) scores for each complex
(Danz et al. 2005). We used eight PCs that were in-
terpreted as gradients across the basin: agriculture
(PC axis 1) indicates overall agriculture pressure,
atmosphere1 (PC axis 1) refers to atmospheric de-
position, atmosphere2 (PC axis 2) indicates values
reflecting basicity (calcium, ammonium, and mag-
nesium cation deposition), facilities1 (PC axis 1) il-
lustrates overall point source facility density,
facilities2 (PC axis 2) indicates density of facilities
that either physically disturb the environment or
discharge polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), urban (PC axis 1) represents urbanization,
population, road, and land cover densities, soils1
(PC axis 1) reflects a suite of landscape variables
related to soil permeability, and soils2 (PC axis 2)
reflects water holding capacity, cation exchange ca-
pacity, and organic matter. 
These eight PCs were regressed against corre-
sponding observed and DI total phosphorus using
multiple linear regressions (using the software pro-
gram NCSS 97). DI total phosphorus was devel-
oped using the transfer function including all
habitats, due to the robust performance in compari-
son to weaker individual wetland transfer functions
(RW, CW) and applicability across the basin. Re-
gressions were similarly performed on the transfer
function excluding OP sites to investigate the rela-
tionship of estimated total phosphorus from
nearshore sites to landscape characteristics. In a
subsequent analysis, various observed and inferred
RW data manipulations were performed to evaluate
apparent poor model performance of the riverine
wetland geomorphic type. The reliability of mea-
sured riverine wetland TP data and the effect of
their inclusion in the total model were investigated.
Landscape data were regressed against observed TP
and: (A) all wetland DI TP developed from the
nearshore model, (B) CW and PW DI TP developed
from the nearshore model, (C) RW DI TP devel-
oped from the nearshore model, (D) independently
reconstructed RW DI TP, and (E) independently re-
constructed RW DI TP added to CW and PW DI TP
developed from the modified nearshore model that
excluded RW observed data. 
RESULTS
Diatoms
A diatom taxa list for all nearshore samples can be
found in Reavie et al. (2006). Samples contained a
rich diversity of diatoms. Over 2,000 taxa were enu-
merated, 380 of which met our criteria to be included
as non-rare taxa. Additional taxa encountered in this
study due to the inclusion of OP samples are listed in
Table 1. Environmental characteristics, including op-
timum, tolerance, and frequency of occurrence, are
provided for each taxon based on the total phospho-
rus model derived from all samples.
Species Assemblage and
Water Quality Analyses
Ordination diagrams illustrate the variations in
diatom assemblages and water quality characteris-
tics among geomorphic types (Fig. 3) and lakes
(Fig. 4), and Table 2 lists the summary data for the
multivariate analyses. MANOVA testing revealed
overall diatom assemblage and water quality differ-
ences among lakes (Wilks’ Lamda, F = 22.39; 
P = < 0.0001) and geomorphic types (F = 34.92; 
P = < 0.0001). No significant interaction effect be-
tween lake and geomorphic type was detected.
Species assemblages in OP samples were signifi-
cantly different from the other geomorphic types,
clearly visible in Fig. 3, top; the separation of OP
from nearshore samples defines the primary (axis 1)
gradient in the CA, which is primarily related to
planktonic taxa in the diatom assemblages. The
group of RW species assemblages was also signifi-
cantly different from those in all other geomorphic
types (Fig. 3, top; Fig. 5). No significant differ-
ences in species assemblages were observed among
HE, EB, CW, and PW. 
Water quality variations were influenced by a nu-
trient gradient (axis 1) and a pH gradient (axis 2),
as was the case in Reavie et al. (2006; no data pre-
sented here). OP water quality was also distinct
from all other geomorphic types, possessing a more
narrow range of environmental variation, which is
evident from the limited extent of the OP PCA
polygon in the lower left quadrant (Fig. 3, bottom).
HE water quality was additionally distinguished
from the three wetland categories (CW, PW, RW),
while EB was distinguished from PW and RW
water quality. 
In terms of species assemblages, ER and ON
were distinct from the other three lakes and from
each other (Fig. 4, top; Fig. 5). In terms of water

quality ER was distinct from SU, HU, and ON, but
overlapped with MI. SU had significantly different
water quality from all other Great Lakes. Analyses
of nearshore samples yielded the same significant
assemblage and water quality differences among
geomorphic types and lakes as analyses that in-
cluded the deeper OP sites (results not shown).

ships with all of the watershed categories except for
agriculture and facilities that discharge PAHs or
physically disturb the environment (facilities2). 
Riverine Wetland Investigations
Based on the poor performance of the RW model,
more detailed investigations were performed on
measured and DI TP data from the riverine wet-
lands to better understand the apparent poor di-
atom-TP relationship (Fig. 8). When compared to
the full nearshore model (graph A, Fig. 8), the r2 for
DI TP versus landscape characteristics slightly de-
creased when RW samples were excluded from the
multiple regression (graph B). However, the mea-
sured TP in the RW samples was not as well linked
to watershed characteristics, as the watershed rela-
tionship to measured TP simultaneously increased
with the removal of RW values. This weak relation-
ship of measured RW TP to landscape stressors was
best illustrated in graph C. We also found more evi-
dence for a more robust watershed stressor relation-
ship with DI TP for RW sites alone (graph C) than
the full nearshore model (graph A), suggesting that
despite a much poorer relationship between mea-
sured TP and watershed characteristics, the DI TP
data in the RWs still well reflected watershed con-
ditions. When the nearshore model was developed
without RW samples, and RW samples were recon-
structed independently, the DI TP/watershed rela-
tionship for RW sites alone remained similarly high
(graph D). However, when the independently recon-
structed values were added to estimates from the
other sites, which were determined without RW in-
clusion, the relationship to landscape stressors
slightly decreased (graph E) when compared to the

TP (standardized prediction error; Fig. 6c), model
performance was most robust when all geomorphic
types were included. Percent maximum bias values
were relatively similar among models (ranging
from 10 to 23%), providing limited information on
characterizing model robustness: although ON, ER,
and SU models appeared to have the lowest predic-
tive bias in the residuals (Fig. 6d). EB and PW
models were also relatively robust, followed by the
nearshore and HE models. Some geomorphic types
appeared to be unreliable as stand-alone models:
CW and RW had particularly low r2jack values, as
did the OP model, which also had a markedly high
standardized prediction error. 
Lakes Superior and Ontario provided the best
transfer functions in the lake-specific evaluations.
Lake Erie was also a fairly strong stand-alone
model while Lakes Huron and Michigan had
markedly poorer performance. Standardized predic-
tion errors for lake inference models were similar to
the error in the model including all lakes, except for
the model derived for Lake Huron, which exhibited
higher error. 
Multiple Linear Regression
with Landscape Stressors
As in Reavie et al. (2006) wetland DI total phos-
phorus was more strongly associated with land-
scape stressors than was measured total phosphorus
(Fig. 7). DI TP had a significant relationship with
agriculture, facility density (facilities1), and soil
properties (soils1 and soils2). The relationship be-
tween landscape stressors and DI TP increased
slightly when open-water samples were excluded
from the model. Measured TP had weak relation-
Diatom Models and Geomorphic Variability 147
original nearshore estimates (graph A). Thus, ex-
cluding measured RW data from model develop-
ment slightly decreased the relationship of
watershed characteristics to DI TP from other sites,
suggesting that the diatom and TP data from river-
ine wetlands are important contributions to the
model in terms of being able to track watershed
characteristics.
DISCUSSION
The specificity of diatom assemblages and water
quality was evaluated for the five Great Lakes and
various coastal habitat types that comprise the Lau-
rentian Great Lakes system. Diatom assemblages
and water quality varied among the geomorphic
types and lakes but did not necessarily vary in con-
cord; significant differences in water quality be-
tween two habitats did not necessarily imply that
diatom assemblages would also be different. For
example, water quality was distinct in the three
wetland categories compared to high-energy sites,
but diatom assemblages overlapped between all
nearshore categories except for riverine wetlands.
Moreover, this distinction of riverine wetland di-
atom assemblages was evident in coastal and pro-
tected wetlands where water quality characteristics
overlapped with riverine wetland data. In addition,
diatom assemblages showed clear lake affinity in
Lakes Erie and Ontario, although both had overlap-
ping water quality with Lake Michigan, the latter
also possessing similar water quality to Lake
Huron. Furthermore, Lake Superior had distinct
water quality from all other lakes, but overlapping
species assemblages with Lakes Michigan and
Huron. This indicates variables other than measured
water quality collected for this study were impor-
tant in determining diatom community composition. 
Offshore samples had clear water quality differ-
ences from nearshore samples and so, not surpris-
ingly, diatom assemblages in these samples were
similarly unique (i.e., mainly planktonic). Open
water diatoms and water quality values were so dis-
tinctive in our coastal dataset that we believed their
inclusion in multivariate analyses might have ob-
scured our evaluation of variation among other geo-
morphic types, which was not the case according to
analyses. However, the distinction between
nearshore and deeper open-water diatom assem-
blages was enough to suggest that the offshore sam-
ples offered little to a model that would be used to
infer nearshore conditions. Previous studies have
used fundamental differences in diatom assem-

Diatom Models and Geomorphic Variability 149
blages as a justification for developing separate di-
atom transfer functions for these communities
(Werner and Smol 2005). Periphyton and phyto-
plankton, which respectively dominate the
nearshore and offshore assemblages, experience
very different physicochemical conditions; there-
fore, it has been suggested that in some cases it is
necessary to focus on one of these functional
groups when developing inference models (Philib-
ert and Prairie 2002). However, this suggestion was
not supported by the omnibus model testing, which
showed the strongest model included all samples. 
We surmise the superior performance of the om-
nibus model is in part a result of consistently low
measured TP in the offshore samples, which ac-
count for most of the low end of the measured TP
gradient encountered in this study. Because of the
unique assemblage properties of the offshore sam-
ples, it is not surprising that we were able to ade-
quately estimate TP in these samples during the
model-testing phase (phytoplankton-dominated as-
semblages generally resulted in low TP reconstruc-
tions),  and consequently obtain good model
performance metrics. However, because these off-
shore assemblages were so different from nearshore
assemblages, the inclusion of offshore assemblages
in a model to reconstruct wetland condition, for ex-
ample, does not seem appropriate. Total phosphorus
varied little in the OP sites, at least during our sam-
pling periods, relative to the nearshore sites. The
poor performance of the individual OP model indi-
cates that a broader range of water quality calibra-
tion data would be required to develop useful
offshore diatom models
We originally anticipated poorer transfer function
performance in the wetlands relative to the HE and
EB sites based on Werner and Smol’s (2005) work
in wetland systems, in which macrophytes were be-
lieved to be related to decreased model perfor-
mance. Two of our wetland models (CW and RW),
in fact, performed poorly, but protected wetlands
(also dominated by macrophytes) produced the
strongest geomorphic type-specific model. We hy-
pothesize that the robust performance of the PW
model resulted because these sites were likely the
least physically disturbed of our geomorphic types,
in contrast to the others that were either hydrologi-
cally “flashier” (e.g., RW) or more exposed to
physical and chemical perturbations from the adja-
cent lake associated with seiches, storms, ice push,
and currents (CW, RW; Keough et al. 1999). In ad-
dition, water velocity and seiche and incoming trib-
utary magnitude are important to wetland habitat
patterns (Trebitz et al. 2005) and may well be im-
portant to diatom community composition. Trebitz
et al. (2002) found that physical characteristics,
such as mouth size and tributary flow, of the same
type of wetland on the same lake could account for
significant hydrologic variability. Differences in
these physical stressors may account for variability
among or within habitat categories and may be re-
flected in poorer diatom transfer functions. Pro-
tected wetland locales were less likely to manifest
short-term chemical and physical fluctuations, thus
enhancing our ability to track diatom-water quality
relationships through the spot sampling used for
model calibration.
On the other hand, riverine wetlands, in general,
are typically subject to fluctuating runoff conditions
to a greater degree than other habitat types (Bed-
ford 1992, Keough et al. 1999, Detenbeck et al.
2005), which likely influenced the discrete point-
in-time water quality measurements performed at
our RW sites. We attribute poor performance of the
RW model to the naturally higher variability of TP
at these sites, resulting in relatively poorer charac-
terization of the prevailing or average water quality
condition by spot sampling, and consequently a

Wetland diatom inferred phosphorus from the

cance (p < 0.05) with agriculture, facilities1,
soils1, and soils2 PCs, while observed total phos-
phorus showed significance with agriculture and
facilities2.

poor diatom-environmental relationship. Measured
phosphorus, in these instances, would be expected
to have a weaker link to landscape stressors, which
was the case for this habitat. In contrast, landscape
stressors were strongly correlated with DI phospho-
rus estimates for riverine wetlands, indicating that
diatom inferred estimates of phosphorus were more
representative of surrounding landscape characteris-
tics than measured total phosphorus. Nevertheless,
our testing of various model permutations revealed
that including the measured RW values in the
model strengthened the relationship to landscape
stressors. So, despite apparently poor diatom-envi-
ronmental relationships in riverine wetlands (and in
RW-specific models) it appears that one can still re-
liably reconstruct TP as a proxy for landscape stress
in these wetlands using the nearshore model. Over-
all, these results suggest that poor diatom-environ-
mental relationships may be expected in models de-
veloped for habitats that are frequently physically
disturbed, and that including samples from more
stable habitats may strengthen models. 
Lake-specific models for Superior, Ontario, and
Erie produced robust transfer functions, suggesting
that lake-specific models may be appropriate when
working in those lakes. Superior and Ontario mod-
els were each more robust than the all-lake model,
and Superior and Erie produced the lowest predic-
tion errors. Potapova and Charles (2002) recom-
mend limiting geographical scope and
environmental characteristics to all but the indicator
metric (in our case, phosphorus) when developing
calibration sets. Although lake-specific models for
Michigan and Huron were less robust, none of the

lakes appear to be a “weak link” in the omnibus
Great Lakes model. However, managers and re-
searchers might favor the omnibus nearshore model
for investigations on Lakes Michigan and Huron.
Model development investigations such as this, and
the related model using integrated water quality
(Reavie 2007 this issue), not only provide informa-
tion on robust environmental indicators, but enable
further understanding of complicated ecosystems,
such as the Laurentian Great Lakes.
In conclusion, we were able to develop strong di-
atom total phosphorus transfer functions for several
individual lakes and nearshore habitats. In some
cases the physical influences of geographic and ge-
omorphic variability may have weakened diatom
indicator models, but these variations in transfer
function robustness provided insight into the lake
and geomorphic systems from which they were de-
rived. With this manuscript we do not wish to rec-
ommend specific transfer functions for management
and research use; the appropriate transfer function
to use may vary according to future study designs
and goals. Further investigations of water quality
and biological dynamics, including regression
against watershed characteristics, in habitats and
lakes with weaker transfer functions will improve
the accuracy of these indicators. Environmental as-
sessments of large systems such as the Laurentian
Great Lakes provide insight into the challenges for
the discreet habitat types within them, and for oth-
ers working in large lakes and coastal regions
worldwide.
