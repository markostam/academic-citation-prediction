ABSTRACT
The serine/threonine kinase pim-1 mRNA contains a
long and G/C rich 50-untranslated region (50-UTR).
Previous work suggested that the pim-1 50-UTR har-
bors an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) allowing
for internal initiation of translation. However, sev-
eral previously reported eukaryotic IRES elements
actually contain cryptic promoter activity. To test
whether an IRES or a cryptic promoter is present in
the pim-1 50-UTR, the 50-UTR was re-examined using
stringent test procedures. Our results show the pres-
ence of strong promoter activity in the DNA sequence
corresponding to the pim-1 50-UTR. Both promoter-
less dicistronic test and northern blot analysis
show transcripts being derived from the cryptic pro-
moter in the pim-1 50-UTR sequence. This cryptic pro-
moter is active in all cell types tested, including Cos-7,
NIH3T3, HEK293, Jurkat and K562 cells. When a dicis-
tronic mRNA containing the pim-1 50-UTR was trans-
lated in vitro or in vivo, no IRES activity could be
detected. However, the control IRESs from both
human rhinovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus
exhibited strong IRES activities. In addition, both
the RNase protection assay and the 50-RACE assay
detected endogenous pim-1 transcripts with shorter
50-UTRs. Our data strongly suggest that the IRES
activity reported earlier for the pim-1 50-UTR sequence
is due to cryptic promoter activity.
INTRODUCTION
The proto-oncogene pim-1 was originally identified as a
preferential integration site of the moloney murine leukemia
virus, which induces T-lymphomas in mice (1). Oncogenicity
of pim-1 has been well documented in both transgenic and
retroviral models (2,3). By itself, pim-1 has low oncogenic
potential but cooperates strongly with other oncogenes, such
as c-myc, n-myc, bcl-2 and gfi-1, in T-lymphomagenesis (4–7).
The pim-1 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase (8), and a
recent report on its crystal structure indicates that it is a
constitutively active kinase (9).
In addition to functioning in tumorigenesis, Pim-1 kinase
also plays a role in cell survival, cell differentiation and cell
proliferation [reviewed in (10)]. Recent studies show that
Pim-1 protects hematopoietic cells from cell death caused by
cytokine withdrawal, glucocorticoids or genotoxins (11–13).
While the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of Pim-1 remain largely
unknown, the finding of phosphorylation and inactivation of
the pro-apoptotic protein Bad might provide a partial explana-
tion for the Pim-1’s role in cell survival (14). Early studies on
the developmentally regulated expression of Pim-1 (15) and its
association with the germ cell maturation (16) indicate an
involvement of Pim-1 kinase in the differentiation of hema-
topoietic cells and germ cells. Pim-1 expression was also
found to be clearly correlated with the increased differenti-
ation of keratinocytes (17). A recent study by Zippo et al. (18)
shows that Pim-1 kinase is required for endothelial and mural
cell differentiation. Expression of Pim-1 kinase in hematopoi-
etic cells is induced by a variety of cytokines, growth factors
and mitogens (19–21). Cell cycle regulated expression of Pim-
1 (22) and identification of several cell cycle regulators,
including cdc25A (23), p21cip1/waf1 (24) and NuMA (25) as
substrates suggest that Pim-1 is important in cell proliferation,
which has been confirmed by the recent study of Pim-1’s role
in smooth muscle cell proliferation (26).
Expression of the Pim-1 kinase is highly regulated and
several mechanisms by which Pim-1 expression is controlled
have been characterized. The levels of pim-1 mRNA are
regulated in part by transcriptional attenuation (27) as well
as by the induction of pim-1 transcripts upon mitogenic stimu-
lation (28). The level of pim-1 mRNAs is also controlled post-
transcriptionally by modulation of mRNA stability (27,29). In
addition, the total level of Pim-1 protein has been shown to be
regulated post-translationally with heat shock protein, Hsp90,

increasing the stability of Pim-1 (30) while overexpression of
phosphatase PP2A reduces the level of Pim-1 protein (31).
Pim-1 expression is also regulated by its 50-untranslated
region (50-UTR), which is long and G/C-rich (32). Our pre-
vious study showed that the 50-UTR of pim-1 mediates the
inhibition of cap-dependent translation (33). Another report
also indicated that pim-1’s 50-UTR appears to contain an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element, which allows
for the internal initiation of the translation of pim-1 mRNA
under conditions that repress cap-dependent translation, such
as viral infection (34). However, the notion of IRES-mediated
translation in eukaryotes has recently been challenged on the
basis of the methods typically used for the identification of
IRES elements in eukaryotic mRNAs (35). It was proposed
that IRES activity in cells transiently transfected with dicis-
tronic DNA constructs may result from aberrant RNA cleav-
age, RNA splicing and/or from the presence of a cryptic
promoter within the DNA construct itself (36). This could
contribute to the formation of low amounts of monocistronic
message that might be translated via conventional ribosomal
scanning mechanisms. Several recent reports have also shown
that previously claimed IRES elements actually contain cryp-
tic promoter activities (37–40). Therefore, despite the initial
finding indicating a putative IRES element in the pim-1
50-UTR, further rigorous testing is required for the positive
identification of real eukaryotic IRESs (41).
In this study, we tested whether an IRES element or a
cryptic promoter is present in the pim-1 50-UTR using more
comprehensive and rigorous methods of analysis. Our results
showed that cryptic promoter activity is present in the pim-1
50-UTR sequence although we found that it is very difficult to
disprove the presence of IRES. We found that DNA sequence
corresponding to the pim-1 50-UTR could regulate the expres-
sion of Pim-1. Thus, our data strongly suggest that the IRES
activity reported earlier for the pim-1 50-UTR sequence might
be due to largely the cryptic promoter activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Restriction enzymes, Lipofectamine 2000, DMRIE-C and
GeneRacer kit were purchased from Invitrogen. T7 RiboMAX
large-scale RNA production system, rabbit reticulocyte lysate
(RRL) system, m7GpppG cap analog and Dual luciferase
reporter assay system were from Promega. HeLa cell cytosol
extract S100 and nuclear extract were from Protein One
(college park, MD). Galactolight plus assay system was
from Applied Biosystem. Midi plasmid purification kit,
RNeasy mini kit and Oligotex mRNA mini kit were obtained
from Qiagen. [a-32P]dCTP and [a-32P]CTP were from Perkin
Elmer. Hybond N+ membrane was from Amersham Bio-
sciences. ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer, MEGA clear
RNA purification kit, MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit
and RPA III RNase Protection Assay kit were obtained
from Ambion.
Plasmids constructs
The following plasmids were kindly provided by Dr A. Willis
(University of Leicester, UK) and Dr J.-T. Zhang (Indiana
University, USA): pF (formerly pGL3) (42), pHpF (formerly
pHpL) (43), pRF (formerly pGL3R) (42), pGL3RutrH (42),
pR-HRV-F (38) and pR-EMCV-F (43).
The 50-UTR of pim-1 was amplified by PCR with the
following two primers containing SpeI and NcoI sites: 50-
ATACTAGTGCTGCAGCGGCCGCGGTGGCTGA-30 and
50-AACCATGGCCCAACCTCCAGGATGTCGGCGCA-30.
The PCR product was cloned into the SpeI and NcoI sites of
the plasmids pF and pHpF to make plasmids pF-PIM and
pHpF-PIM, respectively. The 50-UTR of pim-1 was then intro-
duced into the SpeI and NcoI sites of pRF to create pR-PIM-F.
Dicistronic plasmid pGL3RutrH, containing a stable hairpin at
the 50 end of Renilla luciferase, was used to make pHpR-PIM-
F by replacing the 50-UTR of c-myc with the 50-UTR of pim-1
in the SpeI and NcoI sites. The DNA sequence of this hairpin
structure was originally reported by Stoneley et al. (42).
pHpRF was created by removing the 50-UTR of c-myc from
pGL3RutrH through digesting with SpeI and NcoI.
To generate promoterless dicistronic constructs that allow
analysis of promoter activity of the DNA insert in the inter-
genic region, the Simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter sequence
was removed by SmaI and EcoRV digestion from pRF,
pR-HRV-F, pR-EMCV-F and pR-PIM-F, resulting in RF,
R-HRV-F, R-EMCV-F and R-PIM-F, respectively. The
integrity of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA
sequencing.
In vitro transcription and translation
The plasmids pRF, pR-HRV-F, pR-EMCV-F and pR-PIM-F
were linearized with BamHI. The capped and uncapped tran-
scripts were synthesized with T7 RiboMAX large-scale RNA
production system according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The mRNAs were purified with Ambion’s MEGA clear kit,
quantified spectrophotometrically and their qualities were
verified on a denaturing agarose gel. Equal amounts of
RNA (typical final concentration of 20 ng/ml) were used in
a 20 ml in vitro translation reaction mixture comprising 70%
RRL. The translation mixture contained either 4 ml of extract
buffer, 4 ml of HeLa cytosol extract S100 (8 mg/ml) or 2 ml
of HeLa cytosol extract plus 2 ml of HeLa nuclear extract
(8 mg/ml). An aliquot of 2 ml of each reaction mixtures
were used in a luciferase activity assay (described below).
Cell culture, DNA and RNA transfection
HeLa, HEK293, NIH3T3 and Cos-7 cells were cultured in
DMEM, while DU145, K562 and Jurkat cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640, at 37C with 5% CO2 supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and containing penicillin/streptomycin. All
cells were purchased originally from ATCC. DNA transfection
of adherent cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For a typical
transient transfection, cells were grown to 90–95% confluent
in 24-well plates and then co-transfected with 0.8 mg of luci-
ferase plasmid and 0.2 mg of pSV-b-galactosidase plasmid.
Cells were harvested 30 h after transfection for luciferase
and b-galactosidase activities assay. DNA transfection of
suspension cells was performed with DMRIE-C according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells (4 · 105) were
co-transfected with 0.8 mg of luciferase plasmid and 0.2 mg
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 7 2249
of pSV-b-galactosidase plasmid. At 30 h post-transfection,
activities of luciferase and b-galactosidase were measured.
RNA transfection was performed with DMRIE-C according
to the manufacturer’s suggestion. An aliquot of 2 mg of capped
mRNAs and 4 ml of DMRIE-C were used to transfect 80%
confluent cells grown in 6-well plates. At 8 h after transfection,
cells were harvested and lysed for luciferase activity assay.
Luciferase and b-galactosidase assay
Transfected cells were washed once with 1· PBS and then
lysed in 120 ml of 1· passive lysis buffer. Firefly and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured using a Dual luciferase
reporter assay system according to the manufacturer’s protocol
with the exception that only 50 ml of each reagent was used.
Light emission was quantified using a luminometer (Wallac
Victor 2). Activity of b-galactosidase in cell lysates was
determined using a Galacto-light plus assay system.
Northern blot analysis
Subconfluent Cos-7 cells in 10 cm plates were transfected with
4 mg/plate constructs using Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h after
transfection, the total RNAs were extracted using RNeasy mini
kit. Residual plasmid DNA in the total RNAs was digested
with RNase-free DNase. The poly(A) mRNAs were then
isolated from 250 mg of total RNAs using an oligotex
mRNA mini kit. One-tenth of the mRNAs were separated
on a 1% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel and transferred
onto Hybond N+ membranes. The blots were hybridized with a
32P-labeled firefly luciferase probe. After stripping, the mem-
branes were subsequently hybridized with a 32P-labeled
Renilla luciferase probe in ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer.
Rapid amplification of 50 cDNA end
The 50 end of the pim-1 transcript was analyzed using the
50-RACE method according to the protocol provided with
GeneRacer kit. Briefly, total RNA (4 mg) was dephos-
phorylated with 10 U of calf intestinal phosphatase and pre-
cipitated by ethanol after phenol/chloroform treatment. The
cap structure was subsequently removed with 0.5 U of tobacco
acid pyrophosphatase to produce a phosphorylated RNA at the
50 end, to which the RNA oligonucleotide (50-CGACUGGAG-
CACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA-
30) was ligated. The resulting RNA was reverse-transcribed
using a pim-1 gene specific primer (50-CGGGCGCCA-
GCTTGGTG-30) and 200 U of SuperScript III reverse tran-
scriptase, and then treated with 2 U of RNase H. Tailed
cDNA was amplified by PCR using the GeneRacer 50 primer
(CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA), the pim-1 specific
primer (50-CTTGGTGGCGTGCAGGTCGTTGCA-30) and
2.5 U of Pfu Turbo Hotstart DNA polymerase. The reaction
condition was at 96C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 96C
for 45 s, 56C for 30 s and 72C for 45 s. The reaction was then
extended for 10 min at 72C. PCR products were purified from
2% agarose gel and cloned using the PCR Zero Blunt Cloning
kit. Individual clones were sequenced for the determination of
the transcription start sites.
RNase protection assay
RNase protection assay was performed using the RPA III kit
according to the supplier’s instruction. Briefly, the template
DNA (435 to 1 of the human pim-1 gene) was first cloned
into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the plasmid pBK/CMV. The
resulting plasmid was linearized with EcoRI and transcribed
with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 0.5 mM each
of ATP, GTP, UTP and 0.02 mM CTP supplemented with
3.12 mM [a-32P]CTP. The 32P-labeled probe was digested
with DNase and gel-purified after separation on a 6% acryl-
amide/8 M urea gel. About 3 · 105 c.p.m. of probe was hybrid-
ized with 10 mg total RNA at 45C overnight, followed by
digestion with RNase T1/A at 37C. The protected RNA frag-
ments were precipitated and then separated on a 6% acrylam-
ide/8 M urea gel (from Invitrogen) for autoradiograghy.
RESULTS
The 50-UTR of pim-1 enhances translation when
cap-dependent ribosomal scanning is inhibited
Structural prediction algorithms imply that the 50-UTR of
pim-1 contains extensive RNA secondary structure which
could reduce translational efficiency. Our previous study
indicated that the 50-UTR of pim-1 inhibits translation of
pim-1 mRNA in vitro (33). To examine the effect of the
50-UTR of pim-1 on the expression of the downstream gene
in vivo, we introduced this sequence into the reporter construct
pF immediately upstream of the luciferase-coding region, to
create pF-PIM (Figure 1A). In addition, we wanted to deter-
mine how the 50-UTR sequence of pim-1 affected translation
when the classic cap-dependent mechanism was severely
reduced. To achieve this, we inserted the 50-UTR sequence
of pim-1 into pHpF between the inverted repeat sequence and
firefly luciferase to create pHpF-PIM (Figure 1A). The inver-
ted repeat sequence forms a very stable RNA hairpin structure
(DG = 55 kcal/mol) at the 50 end of the mRNA and has been
shown to inhibit cap-dependent translations (43).
Cos-7 cells were transfected with plasmids pF, pHpF,
pF-PIM and pHpF-PIM, and the luciferase activity from
each construct was determined. Interestingly, despite the
pim-1 50-UTR-mediated inhibition of translation in vitro
(33), the expression of luciferase from pF-PIM is higher
than that from pF. The 50-UTR sequence of pim-1 appears
to enhance translation initiation in vivo (Figure 1B). As expec-
ted, the RNA hairpin sequence in the construct pHpF reduced
luciferase expression by 95% when compared with control
construct pF. However, when the 50-UTR sequence of pim-1
was introduced between the hairpin and the reporter gene,
luciferase expression was stimulated to a level above that
observed with pF (Figure 1B). Because the hairpin structure
efficiently inhibits cap-dependent translation initiation, it was
concluded that an alternative mechanism must be responsible
for the increased synthesis of luciferase.
50-UTR sequence of pim-1 enhances expression of
the second cistron in dicistronic test
A previous study indicated that the 50-UTR of pim-1 might
contain an IRES element (34), which could allow for internal
translation of pim-1 mRNA when cap-dependent translation is
inhibited. To test whether it could function as an IRES element
in vivo, the 50-UTR of pim-1 was subcloned into the intergenic
region of a dicistronic vector pRF, to obtain pR-PIM-F
2250 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 7
(Figure 2A). The IRES sequences of HRV and EMCV were
also engineered in the same way and used as positive controls.
The pRF-based constructs contain a SV40 promoter to direct
the transcription of dicistronic RNA encoding Renilla luci-
ferase as the first cistron and firefly luciferase as the second
cistron. Translation of the first cistron (Renilla luciferase)
serves as an indication of cap-dependent translation, while
translation of the second cistron (firefly luciferase) reflects
the IRES activity of the inserted intergenic sequence. This
approach is considered as a ‘gold standard’ for characterizing
cellular IRES (44). Dicistronic constructs were transfected
into Cos-7 cells and both Renilla and firefly luciferase activ-
ities were measured. As shown in Figure 2B, the 50-UTR
sequence of pim-1 stimulated the expression of firefly luci-
ferase by 115-fold over negative control pRF and 7–8-fold
over positive controls pR-EMCV-F and pR-HRV-F. Similar
data were also obtained from HeLa cells (data not shown).
These results suggest that either (i) the 50-UTR of pim-1 may
enhance read-through of ribosome through the intergenic
region; or (ii) the 50-UTR of pim-1 contains IRES activity
that enhances the translation of firefly luciferase from the
dicistronic mRNA by internal initiation, as suggested previ-
ously (34); or (iii) the 50-UTR of pim-1 may contain a cryptic
promoter or splicing acceptor site that creates a monocistronic
transcript of firefly luciferase.

The 50-UTR of pim-1 does not promote ribosome
read-through in the dicistronic construct
To determine whether the effect of the 50-UTR of pim-1 on the
translation of the second cistron is due to enhanced read-
through by the ribosome through the intergenic region, we
inserted a synthetic hairpin upstream of the Renilla luciferase
to create the dicistronic constructs, pHpRF and pHpR-PIM-F
(Figure 3A). This hairpin structure has a free energy of
55 kcal/mol and has been shown to significantly inhibit
the cap-dependent translation of the first cistron (42). As
shown in Figure 3B, the insertion of hairpin resulted in
90% decrease in the Renilla activity (first cistron) in both
pHpRF and pHpR-PIM-F, as compared with pRF and pR-
PIM-F, respectively, suggesting that the hairpin structure
inhibits the cap-dependent translation. However, the activity
of firefly luciferase (second cistron) produced by pHpR-PIM-F
was almost not affected when compared with pR-PIM-F. This
result demonstrates that the enhanced translation of the second
cistron by the 50-UTR of pim-1 is independent of the cap-
dependent translation initiation of the first cistron. Therefore,
the increased activity of firefly luciferase is not a result of the
read-through by ribosomes from the first cistron (Renilla
luciferase).
50-UTR of pim-1 does not display an IRES activity in
dicistronic mRNA assay
To determine whether the effect of the 50-UTR of pim-1 on the
translation of the second cistron is due to the presence of IRES
activity, we generated dicistronic mRNAs in vitro from the
dicistronic constructs (Figure 2A) and used them to program
translation both in vitro and in vivo. First, the translation
efficiencies of both capped and uncapped dicistronic
mRNAs in RRL were compared. As shown in Figure 4A,
the first cistron (Renilla luciferase) of uncapped dicistronic
mRNAs were translated much less efficiently than that of
capped mRNAs. As expected, the translation of firefly luci-
ferase (second cistron) in negative control pRF was signific-
antly less than that of Renilla luciferase (first cistron). In
addition, IRES of EMCV supported strong expression of
the firefly luciferase (second cistron) from both the capped
and uncapped dicistronic mRNAs, confirming that the func-
tion of EMCV IRES is independent of cap-structure of the
dicistronic mRNAs (45). However, the 50-UTR of pim-1 did
not promote the expression of the firefly luciferase from either
capped or uncapped mRNAs. Actually, the expression of
firefly luciferase (second cistron) from pR-PIM-F transcripts
was significantly less than that of vector control (pRF).
Second, RRL has been shown to lack factors necessary for
IRES-dependent translation initiation for some cellular and
viral IRESs (43,46). To test whether it is the case for the
putative IRES element of the 50-UTR of pim-1, HeLa cyto-
plasmic and nuclear extract were added into the RRL for
in vitro translation. As shown in Figure 4B, when IRES of
the HRV was used as positive control, the addition of HeLa
cytoplasmic extract S100 stimulated expression of firefly luci-
ferase (second cistron) 12-fold above that of the negative
control. Further enhancement of HRV IRES activity (25-
fold) was observed with the additional supplement of HeLa
nuclear extract. However, no stimulation of firefly expression
(second cistron) was observed by the 50-UTR of pim-1 in the
presence of either cytoplasmic extract alone or cytoplasmic
plus nuclear extract.
RNA transfection is one of the major methods for charac-
terizing translation efficiency and identifying eukaryotic regu-
latory factors influencing IRES activity (41). This method
allows a direct analysis of whether the 50-UTR of pim-1 in
the intergenic region of a dicistronic mRNA can enhance the
translation of the second cistron without transcriptional inter-
ference. The in vitro transcribed dicistronic mRNAs were
transfected into Cos-7 cells and the expression of both Renilla
and firefly luciferases were measured. As expected, the firefly
luciferase from the vector control (pRF) was very poorly trans-
lated and its activity (arbitrary units) represented only 0.16%
of the Renilla luciferase (data not shown). The activity of IRES
was expressed as relative ratio of firefly/Renilla activities

were measured and normalized to those of the control plasmid (pRF). The data
were from three independent experiments performed in triplicates.

normalized to that of vector control. As shown in Figure 4C,
the EMCV and HRV IRES significantly stimulated the trans-
lation of firefly luciferase 18- and 25-fold over vector con-
trol. However, no stimulation of firefly luciferase expression
was observed with the 50-UTR of pim-1, the expression of
firefly luciferase (second cistron) from pR-PIM-F transcripts
was 0.06% of Renilla luciferase activity, significantly less
than that observed with vector control. Together, these data
suggest that the 50-UTR of pim-1 does not contain an IRES
element to mediate internal ribosome entry.
50-UTR sequence of pim-1 contains a ubiquitously
functional promoter
The above results prompted us to explore whether the 50-UTR
sequence of pim-1 contains a promoter. For this purpose, we
simply removed the unique SV40 promoter together with the
intron sequence from the pRF-based dicistronic constructs.
These promoterless dicistronic constructs (Figure 5A) were
then transfected into Cos-7 cells and the activities of both
Renilla and firefly luciferases were measured (Figure 5B).
As shown previously (38), both the Renilla and the firefly
luciferase activities were minimal, but detectable for RF vec-
tor control. Only about a 2-fold increase in firefly luciferase
activity was observed with both R-EMCV-F and R-HRV-F
constructs. This small increase was in contrast with the 15-fold
increase associated with the pR-EMCV-F or the pR-HRV-F
constructs (Figure 2B). Thus, the enhanced expression of fire-
fly luciferase from pR-EMCV or pR-HRV-F construct was not
due to production of monocistronic transcripts by a promoter
present in the EMCV or HRV IRES. However, the R-PIM-F
construct generated >120-fold firefly luciferase activity over
vector control. This increase was similar to that generated by
the pR-PIM-F construct in Figure 2B. This significant increase
in the expression of firefly luciferase by the 50-UTR of pim-1 is
probably due to the presence of a strong promoter in this
sequence.
The existence of a constitutively active promoter in the
50-UTR sequence of cellular mRNAs was reported previously
(47). To determine whether a promoter present in the 50-UTR
of pim-1 is ubiquitously utilized, we measured its activity in
various cell lines including NIH3T3 (mouse fiberblast cells),
Jurkat (human T cells), HEK293 (transformed primary embry-
onic kidney cells) and K562 (erythroleukemia cells). As
shown in Figure 5C, the 50-UTR of pim-1 displays strong
promoter activity in all cell lines tested albeit to different
degrees, suggesting that the promoter located in the 50-UTR
of pim-1 is ubiquitously active.
Northern blot analysis
To determine whether the transcript derived from the promoter
located in the 50-UTR of pim-1 can be detected in cells,
poly(A) mRNAs were isolated from Cos-7 cells after trans-
fection with constructs pRF, pR-PIM-F, R-PIM-F, pF,
pR-EMCV-F and pR-HRV-F. The construct pF (Figure 1A)
was used as a monocistronic control, this vector is expected to
generate transcript containing firefly luciferase alone. The
construct pRF (Figure 2A) was used as a dicistronic control,
which will produce a dicistronic transcript of both firefly and
Renilla luciferase sequences. As shown in Figure 6, the dicis-
tronic transcript from control pRF was detected as expected by

transcribed dicistronic mRNAs were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase
from linearized constructs pRF, pR-EMCV-F, pR-HRV-F and pR-PIM-F
(Figure 2A). (A) In vitro translation of capped and uncapped dicistronic
mRNAs. In vitro transcribed capped and uncapped dicistronic transcripts were
translated in RRL. After incubating at 30C for 90 min, Renilla and firefly
luciferase activities were measured and are displayed as relative light units
(RLUs). Cap and UnC indicate capped and uncapped mRNAs, respectively.
The result represents one of three independent experiments. (B) Relative

dicistronic transcripts were translated in RRL in the presence of buffer alone
(Buffer), the HeLa cytosolic extract (S100) or HeLa cytosolic extract plus
nuclear extract (S100+NE). After 90 min incubation at 30C, Renilla and firefly
luciferase activities were measured and the ratio of firefly to Renilla activity
was determined and normalized to the vector control in the presence of buffer.
The data show the results from three independent assays performed in tripli-
cates. (C) Relative luciferase activity from dicistronic mRNAs in vivo. Cos-7
cells were transfected with the capped dicistronic mRNAs, and 8 h following
transfection, Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were measured and the
relative ratios were calculated and normalized to that of the vector-transfected
cells (pRF). The data show the results from four independent assays performed
in triplicates.

both firefly and Renilla luciferase probes (cf. lane 1 in Figure 6A
and B, indicated by an arrowhead), while the monocistronic
transcript from control pF was only detected with the firefly
luciferase probe (cf. lane 4 in Figure 6A and B, indicated by an
arrow). Intact dicistronic mRNAs were generated from both
pR-EMCV-F and pR-HRV-F constructs with the expected
sizes, and no monocistronic transcripts were detected with
these constructs (lanes 5 and 6 in Figure 6A and B). These
observations are consistent with the conclusion that the EMCV
and HRV sequences are IRES elements, which do not contain
cryptic promoters. However, both dicistronic and monocis-
tronic transcripts were generated from pR-PIM-F and this
monocistronic transcript had a similar size to that from mono-
cistronic control pF (cf. lanes 2 and 4 in Figure 6A), suggesting
that it is a monocistronic mRNA from the promoter in the 50-
UTR of pim-1. In addition, the same monocistronic transcript
was also detected with the promoterless dicistronic construct
R-PIM-F (lane 3 in Figure 6A). These observations confirmed
that the 50-UTR of pim-1 has strong promoter activity to derive
the transcript of the second cistron (firefly luciferase).
Our northern blot result is different from what was reported
previously for the pim-1 50-UTR (34). This discrepancy is
probably due to the different kind of dicistronic vector used
by these investigators. Their dicistronic vector contained an
inactive EMCV IRES fragment of 440 nt, which was inser-
ted into the intercistronic region. Although there is a small
deletion in the EMCV insert that could prevent it from func-
tioning independently as an IRES, it might still bind protein
factors without which the appended 50-UTR of pim-1 would
not be active (35). Furthermore, the 50-UTR of pim-1 that they
used was only 354 nt long which was 47 nt shorter than the
full-length pim-1 50-UTR we used. It is possible that those 47 nt
missing from their 50-UTR might have been necessary for the
cryptic promoter activity. It is also possible that the 440 nt of
the EMCV fragment in their dicistronic vector inhibited the
cryptic promoter activity of the shorter pim-1 50-UTR. In addi-
tion, the HeLa cells they used for transfection, might only
produce limiting levels of the transcription factor(s) necessary
for cryptic promoter activity. Therefore, in their experimental
system they did not detect monocistronic transcripts generated
from the cryptic promoter in the pim-1 50-UTR.
Detection of endogenous transcripts derived from
the 50-UTR promoter in human cancer cell lines
The above results showed that the promoter located in the
50-UTR of pim-1 is active in transfected cell lines. It is of
great interest to know whether this cryptic promoter is used
to generate endogenous pim-1 transcripts with a short 50-
UTR sequence. To determine whether those shorter pim-1 tran-
scripts exist, we first performed an RNase protection assay with
the RNAs isolated from both K562 and DU145 cells, which are
known to express high level of Pim-1 protein. Using a probe
covering the full-length of the pim-1 50-UTR (Figure 7A), three
protected bands with estimated sizes of 53, 33 and 21 bases,
respectively, were observed (Figure 7B). Interestingly, a large
protected band of 421 bases was only detected with RNAs
isolated from the K562 cells. However, no protected RNAs were
found with yeast tRNA control. This result indicates that pim-1
transcripts from K562 cells and DU145 cells have various
50-UTRs and most probably, multiple transcriptional start sites.

To further demonstrate the existence of endogenous pim-1
transcripts with shorter 50-UTRs, we also carried out 50-RACE
with total RNAs isolated from K562 cells. After one round
PCR of 35 cycles with gene specific primer, multiple products
with various lengths ranging from 100 to 550 bp were
amplified. Those products were then excised from the gel,
cloned and sequenced. The sequencing data indicate that
three small transcripts were initiated from nucleotide 21,
33 and 53 upstream of the translation start codon, respect-
ively, which are consistent with the protected bands of 53, 33

and 21 bases shown by RNase protection assay (data not
shown). In addition, our DNA sequencing data also show
that pim-1 transcripts with the full-length 50-UTR were gen-
erated, which most probably accounts for the longest band
(421 bases) shown in RNase protection assay (data not
shown). Together, these results show that endogenous pim-1
transcripts with shorter 50-UTRs exist in human cell lines and
that they are probably derived from the promoter located in the
50-UTR of pim-1 sequence.
DISCUSSION
The expression of Pim-1 is subject to complicated regulation at
multiple levels: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, transla-
tional and post-translational (10). This complexity underlines
the importance for the appropriate control of Pim-1 kinase to
cell survival and function. Pim-1 kinase, as indicated by a
recent study of its crystal structure, is constitutively active
(9). This is in sharp contrast to other serine/threonine kinases,
such as protein kinase A (PKA), Akt and PKC, whose activ-
ities need to be activated through phosphorylation, and/or
other modes of post-translational modification. The activity
of Pim-1 kinase, however, appears to be controlled by its total
amount. This means that the regulation of Pim-1 expression is
crucial for its activity and cellular functions. In this study, we
report for the first time that the expression of Pim-1 kinase can
also be regulated by the cryptic promoter in the 50-UTR
sequence.
Most vertebrate transcripts contain 50-UTRs of 20–100 nt
long that are unlikely to impede translation initiation from the
AUG codon (48). The 50-UTR of pim-1 is 391 nt long and 76%
G/C-rich. The predicted secondary structure has a free energy
of DG = 153 kcal/mol and could severely inhibit the trans-
lation of pim-1 mRNA in vitro (33). A previous study showed
that the pim-1 transcript was found associated with polysomes
during polioviral infection and a dicistronic test indicated that
the 50-UTR of pim-1 might contain an IRES element (34).
Here, we demonstrated that the 50-UTR of pim-1 could
enhance downstream gene expression in a monocistronic con-
struct when cap-dependent initiation is blocked by the intro-
duction of a stable hairpin structure (Figure 1). In the
conventional dicistronic DNA assay, the 50-UTR of pim-1
enhanced the expression of the second cistron by 120-fold
(Figure 2) and translation of the second cistron persisted even
when a stable hairpin structure was used to block translation of
the first cistron (Figure 3). When dicistronic RNA transcripts
were used to perform in vitro translation and RNA transfec-
tion, the 50-UTR of pim-1 failed to display any enhanced
activity for the second cistron. In contrast, both EMCV and
HRV IRESs in dicistronic RNAs can direct the translation of
the second cistron both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 4). This
strongly suggests that the 50-UTR of pim-1 does not have an
IRES. This conclusion is supported by our promoterless dicis-
tronic test, which revealed that the enhanced expression of the
second cistron was due to the existence of promoter activities
in the 50-UTR of pim-1 (Figure 5). In addition, northern blot
analysis clearly demonstrated that the monocistronic tran-
scripts of firefly luciferase were generated from both the con-
ventional dicistronic and the promoterless dicistronic
constructs (Figure 6). Finally, using the RNase protection
assay and 50-RACE, we identified three endogenous pim-1
transcripts with shorter 50-UTRs of 53, 33 and 21 bases in
both human cancer cell lines K562 and DU145 (Figure 7).
Despite the previous claim of IRES presence in the 50-UTR
of pim-1, the existence of such cellular IRES has been
challenged recently due to the potential uncertainty with the
methods typically used for IRES identification (35,36). Recent
studies stress the importance of using alternative test proced-
ures (e.g. direct RNA transfection) in conjunction with a com-
bination of sensitive RNA analysis for discerning IRES-
containing sequences in eukaryotic mRNAs (41,49). In fact,
several previously claimed IRESs activities were discovered to
be due to promoter activity present in the same region of the
50-UTR (37–40). Our finding is reminiscent of this situation,
about a eukaryotic translation initiation factor elF4G, where
a strong promoter was found in the putative IRES of the
transcripts encoding eIF4G. This promoter also lies in the
50-UTR believed to harbor an IRES (38). As in our case, no
evidence for IRES could be found when a dicistronic mRNA
containing the 50-UTR sequence was translated in vitro or
in vivo. The promoterless dicistronic test and northern blot
analysis, however, clearly demonstrated the presence of a
cryptic promoter in the 50-UTR sequence.
It is recognized that the long 50-UTRs present in the majority
of the proto-oncogenes inhibit cap-dependent translation (50)
and that an IRES-mediated translation initiation may be used
for these mRNAs (51). However, it has not been well appre-
ciated that these long 50-UTR DNA sequences may contain
promoters generating significantly shorter 50-UTRs. Our RPA
and 50-RACE results (Figure 7) demonstrated that the 50-UTR
of endogenous pim-1 transcripts in human cancer cell lines are
heterogeneous, three of them are significantly shorter than the
full-length 50-UTR. Most cellular mRNAs possess 50-UTRs of
<100 nt and are likely to allow efficient initiation of translation
by cap-dependent ribosomal scanning (52). Therefore,
these alternative transcripts with shorter 50-UTRs are most
probably quite suitable for efficient cap-dependent translation
initiation and do not require an IRES-mediated translation
mechanism.
Although the existence of a cryptic promoter in the 50-UTR
of a gene is not common, alternative promoter usage and
heterogeneity of transcription initiation have been observed
for many genes, including oncogenes and protein kinases. For
example, transcription of c-myc gene involves P0, P1, P2, P3
and P4 promoters (53) and c-Abl kinase gene has two pro-
moters (54). Alternative promoters are often responsible for
tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific gene expres-
sion [reviewed in (55)]. The usage of alternative promoters
is also very important in regulating the level of gene expres-
sion. This can be achieved at the transcriptional level by
(i) using promoters of different strengths (56); (ii) responding
to different extracellular signals through different promoters
(57); or (iii) generating mRNA isoforms that differ in their
50-UTR, tissue and subcellular distribution and stability (58).
The wild-type promoter of the pim-1 gene was previously
reported to have the structural features of a house-keeping
gene (59). The cryptic promoter in the 50-UTR of pim-1
would contribute additional diversity and flexibility to the
complicated regulation of Pim-1 expression and might provide
partial explanation for its tissue-specific and/or developmental
differential expression.
