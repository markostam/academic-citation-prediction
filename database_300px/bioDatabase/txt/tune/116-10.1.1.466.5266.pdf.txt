Efficient Prediction of Ground Surface Temperature and Moisture, 
With Inclusion of a Layer of Vegetation

National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado 80307 
An efficient ime-dependent equation for predicting round surface temperature devised by Bhumralkar 
(1975) and Blackadar (1976) is tested against a 12-layer soil model and compared with five other 
approximate methods in current use. It is found to be generally superior if diurnal forcing is present and 
very much superior to the use of the insulated surface assumption. An analogous method of predicting 
ground surface moisture content is presented which allows the surface to become moist quickly during 
rainfall or to become drier than the bulk soil while evaporation occurs. These improved methods are not 
of much relevance unless the main influences of a vegetation layer are included. An efficient one-layer 
foliage parameterization is therefore developed that extends continuously from the case of no shielding of 
the ground by vegetation to complete shielding. It includes influences of both ground and foliage albedos 
and emissivlties, net leaf area index, stomatal resistance, retained water on the foliage, and several other 
considerations. When it is tested against data for wheat measured by Penman and Long (1960), it appears 
quite adequate despite the many simplifying assumptions. The parameterization predicts that errors of up 
to a factor of 2 in evapotranspiration can be incurred by ignoring the presence of a vegetation layer. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The determination of ground surface temperature within a 
numerical weather prediction model is usually accomplished 
by solution of a surface energy balance equation. A trouble- 
some component, however, is the soil heat flux, which appar- 
ently requires the time-dependent solution for soil temperature 
within six or more layers of soil for reasonably good accuracy 
[Benoit, 1976]. Since the number of layers in the soil may then 
be comparable to the number of atmospheric layers com- 
prising the model, abbreviations are usually sought for dealing 
with the soil heat flux. However, the abbreviations presently in 
use are very crude. 
The prediction models of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
Laboratory (GFDL) of Princeton have ignored the soil heat 
flux entirely [see Manabe et al., 1974], as has also a version of 
the UCLA two-level model [Gates, 1975]. The National Center 
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) model attempts to im- 
prove upon this omission by assuming that the soil heat flux, G 
= -X(•T/•z)o, is one third the sensible heat flux Hs to the 
atmosphere. Here ?, is the soil thermal conductivity, T is 
temperature, and subscript zero refers to evaluation at the 
ground surface. (As is customary, G is defined as positive when 
directed downward; atmospheric fluxes will be defined as posi- 
tive when directed upward.) A list of symbols used in this 
paper is found in the notation list at the end of this paper. The 
proportionality constant, •, was chosen by Kasahara and 
Washington [1971] on the basis of the study of Sasamori 
[1970], who simulated a measurement period of the O'Neill 
experiment [Lettau and Davidson, 1957]. Another possibility is 
to assume that G is proportional to the net radiative flux Rnet; 
a proportionality constant of about -0.4 is suggested by the 
study ofldso et al. [1975a], while a value of-0.19 when the net 
radiative flux is downward and -0.32 when it is upward has 
been recommended by Nickerson and Smiley [1975] for O'Neill 
type conditions. However, since the negative soil heat flux 
equals the sum of all the atmospheric fluxes (as stated by the 
surface energy balance equation), any assumption that it is

proportional to any particular component, or partial set of 
such components, seems dangerously nongeneral. 
An entirely different approach to the soil heat flux has been 
proposed by Shaffer and Long [1975]. It is based upon the 
analytic solution to the diffusion equation [Carlslaw and Jae- 
ger, 1959], which makes use of a time-weighted summation of 
all past values of G and theoretically requires that on each time 
step a fresh summation be constructed from all past values. In 
practice, a regrouping and truncation of terms within the 
summation is performed periodically. However, it is not clear 
if this method can be made as efficient as the use of, say, six 
soil layer temperatures with layer thickness increasing with 
depth while retaining high accuracy. 
A method developed independently by Arakawa [1972] and 
by the British Meteorological Service [Corby et al., 1972; Rown- 
tree, 1975] utilizes a rate equation for the ground surface 
temperalure Tg, dependent upon forcing by the sum of the 
atmospheric energy fluxes. It seems promising because it al- 
lows the temperature of a slab of soil to depend explicitly upon 
soil properties in the proper way; however, as was pointed out 
by Bhumralkar [1975], it omits the influence of soil heat flux on 
the underside of the slab. 
Recently, Bhumralkar [1975] and Blackadar [1976] have 
independently proposed a method similar to the above Tg rate 
equation, which, however, contains the mechanism by which a 
deeper soil layer can influence the surface temperature. This 
method appears even more promising and is still much more 
efficient than the use of multiple soil layers. 
With the multiplicity of methods presently in use it seems 
appropriate to point out their similarities and differences and 
to compare their accuracies for different types of soil. 
The prediction of specific humidity of the air at the gr'ound 
surface is in one respect usually treated slightly better than the 
prediction of Te because an additional time-dependent equa- 
tion for soil wetness is usually carried [Manabe, 1969; Wash- 
ington and Williamson, 1977]. However, for purposes of short- 
range prediction this method also needs improvement. The 
evaporation rate at the ground, Ee, is assumed to be given by 
Eg = paCnUaa[q,,t(Tg)- qa] (la) 
Eg = OaCnUa(qg - qa ) (lb) 
a = min (1, W•/W•) (lc) 
1890 DEARDORFF: SOIL TEMPERATURES 
where W: is the net soil moisture (depth of extracted liquid 
water) within a thick upper layer of soil, Wn is the critical 
depth this layer is capable of holding before the surface is 
considered to act as if it were saturated, qsat is the saturation 
specific humidity at the ground surface temperature Tg and 
pressure ps, q, is the specific humidity of the air at height z, 
within the surface layer, and qg is the surface value of q. Also, 
0• is the air density, and u• is the wind speed at z = z•, to which 
height the bare ground moisture or heat transfer coefficient Clio 
applies. 
In conjunction with (1) the time-dependent equation for W2 
is 
•9W•/•9t = -(Eg- P)/pw 0 • W2 • gma x (2) 
where P is the precipitation rate (mass of water exchanged per 
unit area and unit time), pw is the density of water, and Wmax is 
the maximum value of water depth, or field capacity, which 
exceeds Wn. (Runoff is considered to prevent W• from ex- 
ceeding gma x.) 
The definition of qg implied by (1) is 
qg = aqsat(Tg) + ( 1 - a)q• (3a) 
but an obvious restriction that should be recognized [Benoit, 
1976; Rowntree, 1975] is 
qg < qs•t(Te) (3b) 
The main shortcoming of (1) is that E• does not respond to 
short-period occurrences of precipitation and evaporation 
which only gradually change W: according to (2) and therefore 
only gradually change qe and Ee according to (1). For ex- 
ample, a rainfall of 1 cm in 3 hours would increase W: from 4 
to 5 cm, say, relative to a saturated value of l0 cm, while in this 
period Eg as predicted from (1) would only increase 10% of the 
way toward its wet surface potential value. Instead, one would 
prefer a simple method which treats the actual surface and 
allows it to become saturated after only a short period of 
rainfall and to dry out substantially following evaporation. An 
accurate estimation of Ee is very important for the prediction 
of T•. 
Finally, there is little knowledge of how accurate the predic- 
tion of ground temperature Tg need be, when in actuality a 
complicated vegetative ground cover is usually present in the 
situation toward which the calculation of Tg is applied. It 
might be thought that the GFDL method, which assumes an 
insulated lower boundary, effectively treats the very case of a 
foliage-covered ground surface and actually applies to the 
estimation of mean foliage temperature. However, this inter- 
pretation neglects the facts that (1) significant amounts of heat 
and moisture may diffuse from the ground up through the 
vegetative canopy, (2) the foliage transpires at a rate not 
closely dependent upon W•, and (3) on a large scale a signifi- 
cant fraction of the surface, either ground or rocks, is usually 
exposed to solar and atmospheric radiation and is not totally 
shielded by vegetation. 
The purpose of this paper is to overcome the shortcomings 
described above. Bhumralkar's [1975] and Blackadar's [1976] 
approximate method of calculating Tg will be tested against 
the other methods which have been mentioned. An analogous 
approximate method for estimating soil surface moisture and 
qg will be presented and tested. Finally, a highly simplified 
parameterization of the influence of a vegetative layer will be 
presented, along with a comparison of how its inclusion affects 
Tg and the net fluxes of heat and moisture to the atmosphere. 
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF Te PREDICTION METHODS 
The various methods to be compared are designated and 
described in Table 1. In this table, Ha = -G is the sum of the 
fluxes in the atmosphe_re at the ground, t•8 is the soil density, c8 
is the soil specific heat, d• = (K•rl) x/• is proportional to the 
depth reached by the diurnal temperature wave, K8 is the soil 
thermal diffusivity, r• is a period of 1 day, and T• is a deep soil 
temperature to be discussed later. 
a. Multiple soil layer model. In the comparative tests, T•m 
from a 12-layer soil model will be considered the 'true' value of 
Tg with which the value from the more approximate methods 
will be compared. The vertical coordinate transformation •' = 
In (1 + z/b), b = 1 cm, is used, along with equal intervals in 
of A•- = 0.385. Soil grid points are located at depths of 0, 0.47, 
1.11, 2.17, 3.66, 5.84, 9.05, 13.76, 20.69, 30.86, 45.80, 67.75, 
and 100.0 cm. Below the 100.0-cm depth the soil heat flux is 
assumed to be zero. The second-derivative soil diffusion terms 
are finite differenced by the Dufort-Frankel method by using a 
time step of At = 15 s. Only for the sake of accuracy is the 
time step made this small, and results were essentially the same 
as if second-order spatial differencing with a forward time step 
had been used. The soil flux, G =-X(•gT/•gZ)o, is obtained 
from -X(T• - Tgr•)/z•, where zx = 0.47 cm. No consideration 
is given to any heating effects of water phase change within the 
soil below the surface or heat transport by water movement.

where Eg is the emissivity of the ground surface in the infrared, 
a is the Stefan-Boltzman constant, Hsg is the sensible heat flux 
at the ground to the atmosphere, L is the latent heat of 
condensation, a• is the ground albedo, S *. is the magnitude of 
the shortwave radiative flux, and R•. is the downcoming 
longwave radiative flux. The second, third, and fourth meth- 
ods listed in Table I replace -G on the right of (4) with the 
indicated assumption and then solve for T•; the last two meth- 
ods also make use of HA. 
Within HA the three terms on the left depend upon T•, and 
the two nonlinear terms, E•aTg 4 and L.E, are linearized for 
convenience. That is, with superscript (n) referring to the nth 
time step index, [T•(n+x•] 4 is approximated by 
and 
qsat(Te (n+•') = qsat(T• ©) + (&q•t/&T)v,,n, .[T• (•+" - Tg (•'] 
where •9qsat/•T is obtained from the Clausius-Clapeyron 
equation at T = Te © and qsat(Ttt Inl ) is obtained from Tetens' 
[1930] equation. The linear solution of (4) for Te •"+'•, making 
use of the known value of Te •"•, is then straightforward. 
In (4), H•g is specified analogously to E• in (lb): 
H,• = pacpCuoUa(T• - T• ) (5) 
, 
where cp is the specific heat at constant pressure and T• is the 
air temperature at height z• within the surface layer. 
In the solar radiation term of (4), S * is assigned the time- 
dependent value appropriate to 45 ø latitude on March 21, 
attenuated by 15% (or more when clouds are specified to be 
present). 
In the last term of (4), RL* is prescribed by 
RL •= [a• + (1 - a•)0.67(1670q•)ø'ø•]aTa a (6) 
where the factor in brackets is the parameterization for the 
effective emissivity of the air proposed by Staley and Jurica 
[1972] for clear skies (a• = 0) and a• is the cloud fraction. 
C. HA forcing method. The method of Arakawa [1972], 
Corby [1972], and Rowntree [1975] is here called the HA forcing 
method because T• = Ter is in that method driven by HA: 
• Tgr/• t = -(•')•/:HA/(pscsdx ) (7) 
d. Force restore method. Bhumralkar's [1975] and Black- 
adar's [1976] approach is here called the force restore method 
because the forcing by --HA is modified by a restoring term 
which contains the deep soil temperature T:: 
aTer•/at = -C, HA/(p•c•d,)- c:(Ter • - T:)/r, (8a) 
with 
c, = 2• "/• c: = 2•' (8b) 
For the short-range studies that Blackadar had in mind, T: can 
be treated as a constant and estimated as he suggested from the 
mean air temperature over the previous 24 hours. For longer- 
range purposes (longer than about 3 days), T: may be calcu- 
lated from 
where 
c• T•/ c• t = - HA/(pscsda ) (9) 
d• = (365•,r,) '/: (10) 
is •-x/: times the e folding depth of the annual temperature 
wave. If one wishes d: to represent he latter depth, then the 
factor ;r x/: should multiply HA in (9), in analogy to (7). 
The last term in (8a) is seen to restore T•r• exponentially 
toward the mean (or deep) soil temperature if HA is removed. 
The constants cx and c: are chosen to yield the exact solution 
for a sinusoidally varying soil surface heat flux G after any 
transients have died away. For G = A .sin (2•-t/r• + •-/4) this 
exact solution is [Sellers, 1965]: 
Te = T= + {Ar,/[(2•r)'/:O•c•d•]} sin (2•rt/r,) (11) 
where t is time and A is the amplitude of G. 
The constants chosen by Blackadar for c• and c: in (8a) are 
slightly different: 3.72 and 7.4, respectively, to account for 
higher harmonics of the diurnal cycle. 
The method of Bhumralkar [1975] is exactly the same as that 
of (8a) and (8b) except hat he treated the temperature within a 
thin 1-cm slab of soil just below the surface. Instead, if his 1- 
cm slab thickness is denoted by •, say, and carried through to 
his (15), then that equation reduces to (8) as • • 0. 
In using the Tgr• rate equation (8) the terms within HA which 
_ 
contain Ter• are also linearized and treated by the Crank- 
Nicolson method: i.e., Ter• values are expressed as the average 
of values at the (n) and (n + l) time levels for OTe/c9t being 
expressed by (T• •"+• - Tg•"•)/At. The HA forcing rate equa- 
tion for Ter in (7) is treated exactly the same as it is in (8), 
except that cx is taken as •-•/: and c: as 0. 
3. RESULTS OF TESTING (8) AND OTHER 
APPROXIMATE METHODS FOR T• 
In the tests to be described in this section, (1), (2), and (3) 
were utilized to obtain q• and Ea; a modified method for 
obtaining qg is described in section 4. The value of cu0 utilized 
in (1) and (5) was 0.0025. 
Five different sets of soil parameters and other relevant 
values were stipulated, as indicated in Table 2. They are cho- 
sen to be roughly consistent with data presented by Sellers 
[ 1965], Lettau [ 1951 ], and Lettau and Davidson [1957]. 
a. Constant atmospheric forcing except for variable solar 
radiation. In this set of tests the atmospheric temperature T• 
and specific humidity q• at z = z• were held constant at 280 K 
and 5 X 10 -a, respectively, except in case 5 of a simulated deep 
snow layer for which they were changed to 270 K and 3.0 X

10-*. The wind speed ua was held constant at 4 m s -•. No 
clouds or precipitation were introduced. Initial soil temper- 
atures, specified at about local sunset ime, were assigned the 
value of Ta. 
Predicted bare ground values of Tam, Ta•, TaB, Tat, Tat, and 
Tart are shown in Figures l a-le for a l-day period with clear 
skies. A time step of 10 min was used (except for 15 s for Tam). 
Emphasis is given to the 10-min time step because that value is 
typical of the value used within a global circulation model. 
In the figures we notice that Ta• precedes the true solution in 
phase by about an hour, while Tar lags it by 1-2 hours. In cases 
1-4, Tat overshoots the peak amplitude by 2•-6 K and Tar by 
1.5-2.0 K. The approximate methods have the most difficulty 
with case 2, for which the medium has the greatest values of K8 
and 3,. In this case, Ta• overshoots the peak value by 3 K, Tat 
overshoots it by 2 K, and Tart undershoots it by 0.8 K. The 
approximate methods have difficulty in simulating the evening 
hours when G is relatively most important and, except for Tat, 
predict Ta values 1-2 K too low. 
(with At -- 10 min) superior to the other approximate meth- 
ods; Tat is then the least accurate. 
The relative error 
et = [((Ta- rarn)2)]'/2/Ararn 
during the second 24-hour period of the comparisons is pre- 
sented in Table 3 for each of' the approximate methods. The 
quantity T a in et here stands for the calculated ground temper- 
ature by the approximate method tested, Tarn in et always 
refers to the Tarn calculation with the 15-s time step, the angle 
brackets are the average over the second 24-hour period, and 
fTa,,, is the diurnal range in Tarn. Overall, for a 10-min time 
step the error in Tart is seen to be only about 0.62 as large as 
for Ta• or Tat and only one third as large as for Tat. The results 
confirm the assertion of Bhumralkar [1975] that Tat does not 
realistically reproduce the diurnal variation of T a. 
A test was made on the fidelity of Tarn with its 15-s time step 
by comparing it with the exact solution (11) for G varying 
sinusoidally. The et value for Tern relative to Ta (exact), after 9 
In case 4 (still muddy water) the occurrence ofevaporation , days, averaged only 0.008 for the five different sets of soil 
at the full potential rate somewhat moderates the diurnal 
amplitude and causes the various solutions to be more similar 
to each other than they would be otherwise. In case 5 (snow 
layer) all the approximate methods appear more satisfactory 
because of the melting temperature constraint. However, be- 
cause of the insulating property of snow, Ta• is in this one case 
properties, and extreme values of Tarn on the second day 
differed from those on the ninth day by no more than 0.68% of 
the diurnal range. Hence it is concluded that second-day val- 
ues of Tarn were a viable standard against which to compare 
the more approximately calculated temperatures. 
Tests were also conducted on the influence of the time step 
DEARDORFF: SOIL TEMPERATURES 1893 
upon the approximate methods, and results are included in 
Table 3. As was pointed out by a reviewer, for constant atmo- 
spheric forcing but variable solar radiation the values of Tgt, 
Tgs, and Tgr would reach maxima at the time of maximum 
solar radiation (noon) were it not for the linearization proce- 
dure already discussed. This procedure causes the calculated 
times of maxima to lag more and more as/xt is increased. In 
addition, the soil heat flux assumptions involved in the Tgs and 
Tsr solutions also involve quantities evaluated on the previous 
time step, and this explains why the Tss and Tsr maxima lag 
the maximum insolation more than the Tst maximum does. 
Thus it turned out that the Tg• solution has least error for a 
time step between 10 and 30 rain, while the Tss and Tsr 
solutions have least error for/xt • 10 min. The Tsrr values are 
seen to retain superior accuracy even for large time steps. 
Included in Table 3 are er values for/xt - 10 rain and for 
equatorial latitude. In this test the initial soil temperature and 
Ta were increased to 287 K. The er values are little changed 
because of the normalization by the range of Tsm, which, as is 
indicated in the table, increased by up to 38%. 
In other tests with a 10-rain time step the assumption G - 
-0.4Rnet was tried, but this led to er values about twice as large 
in cases 1, 3, and 4. Also, the assumption G - -0.10Rnet (Rnet 
incoming) and -0.50 Rnet (Rnet outgoing) utilized by Gadd and 
Keers [1970] was tested, but er values were larger in all cases by 
an average factor of 1.37. 
The steady state form of (8) was also tested in the five cases, 
but ground temperatures then were substantially less accurate 
than the Tgtr values. 
In one test the force restore method was tried with c• = 3.72 
and c2 = 7.4, as suggested by Blackadar [1976]. The er values 
for a 10-rain time step then were slightly smaller for cases 4 
and 5, the same for case 3, and slightly larger for cases 1 and 2 
than with the use of Cx = 3.55 and c: = 6.28. Results do not 
appear to be overly sensitive to the choice of c• and c:. 
Other conclusions for the case of diurnal forcing which may 
be drawn from Table 3 are (1) for time steps of •t hour or 
greater, only the force restore method retains significant skill 
relative to the assumption G = 0; (2) the assumptions relating 
G either to Hsg or to Rnet are nearly equally successful; and (3) 
the methods of Hss or Rnet dependence are about as successful 
as the force restore method for simulation of O'Neill type 
conditions when a 10-rain time step is used but generally not as 
successful otherwise. 
b. Random plus diurnal forcing. It is of interest to test (8) 
and the other approximate methods when the atmospheric 
forcing is partially random and contains fluctuations of period 
much shorter than the diurnal cycle. For this purpose the wind 
speed, air temperature, and specific humidity were allowed to 
vary as first-order Markovian processes (values continuous in 
time but time differences random) with standard deviations of 
1.2 m s -x, 1.0 K, and 0.5 X 10 -•, respectively, relative to the 
same mean values mentioned before. In addition, the solar 
radiation was attenuated by the factor (1-0.6at), where trc is a 
similarly varying cloud fraction with a mean value of about 0.3 
and a standard deviation of about 0.1. The cloud fraction also 
influenced RL * according to (6). Again, (1) and (3) were uti- 
lized to obtain qe and the evaporation rate; no precipitation 
was allowed, and W2 was held constant. 
The random forcing was reapplied on each time step of the 
approximate method and therefore not on every time step of 
the 15-s Tsm calculations.

Fig. 2. Ground surface temperatures calculated over a 2-day pe- 
riod with the atmospheric forcing being partially random. Symbols are 
as in Figure la for the calculation methods listed in Table 1. Figure 2a 
is for case I of Table 2, and Figure 2b for case 2. 
of the approximate methods is very similar to that portrayed in 
Figures l a-le so that cases 3-5 are not presented. Tgfr values 
have degraded only very slightly and, on the average, remain 
superior to the other Tg approximations tested for all values of 
the time step, as shown in Table 3 by the er values given in 
parentheses. A new feature which these er values disclose is 
that the relative error in Tst in the presence of some random 
forcing is increased by 20-30% for time steps of l0 rain or 
more, owing to the lack of any simulation of thermal inertia of 
the soil. 
c. Random forcing only. One may question if, in the pres- 
ence of random forcing but in the absence of diurnal forcing, 
Tgfr retains any skill over Tst. The force restore method makes 
direct use of the assumption that a predominant forcing of 
period r• exists. A random forcing comparison test was there- 
fore conducted, exactly as it was in section 3b above, except 
that all solar forcing was removed. Much smaller ranges in 
T•r• then resulted, of only about 1-3 K in cases 1-4 and 5 K in 
case 5. The case average e• values which were then obtained for 
a time step of 10 rain are 0.28 for Ts•, 0.12 for Tgs, 0.14 for T•, 
0.17 for T•, and 0.18 for T•. Thus T• and the other approx- 
imate methods do retain very significant skill in relation to the 
assumption G = 0. Although T•s is found to be the superior 
method here, its advantage over Tgtr is not great, since the 
absolute errors were only of the order of 0.5 K. 
4. FORCE RESTORE TREATMENT OF GROUND SOIL MOISTURE 
a. Method. Let us denote the volume fraction of soil 
moisture by w (volume Ho.O/volume soil, or depth of liquid 
H20/depth soil), and let wn denote the value of w above which 
the surface is considered to act as if it were saturated. Upon 
assuming that most of the vertical movement of w within the 
soil can be described by a diffusion process, we may postulate 
the existence of an equation for gw•/Ot, where w• is the 
ground surface value of w. The result is 
Ot pwd•' r• (12) 
0 • Wg • Wmax 
where pw is the density of liquid water, C• and Co. are constants 
analogous to c• and co., d•' is a depth to which the diurnal soil 
moisture cycle extends, wo. is the vertically averaged value of w 
over a thicker layer do.' below which the moisture flux is negli- 
gible, and Wma• is the maximum value of ws which exceeds wn. 
Runoff of precipitation reaching the ground is considered to 
occur when wg exceeds Wmax. 
A}though the coefficients Cx and Co. are somewhat uncertain 
and depend upon soil type, the data of Jackson [1973] for 
Adelanto loam suggest hat 
C1 = 0.5 Wa/Wma x >_ 0.75 
C• = 14 - 22.5 [(w•/wma•) - 0.15] 
(13a) 
(13b) 
0.15 < Wa/Wmax < 0.75 
C• = 14 Wtl/Wmax < 0.15 (13c) 
and 
with 
Co. = 0.9 (14) 
d•' = 10cm do.' = 50cm (15) 
The same data show how strong the influence of the diurnal 
cycle is upon the soil moisture fraction in the uppermost 5 mm 
of bare soil and provide justification for using the diurnal 
period in the denominator of the last term in (12). Earlier data 
of Schiff and Dreibelbis [1949] lack the very high resolution 
necessary for evaluation of the two constants but also suggest 
that Cx is usually larger than Co.. 
The time-dependent equation for wo. is 
•wo./•gt = -(Ea- P)/p•do.' 0 _< w2-< Wmax 
For comparison with (1)-(3) it may be noted that 
(16) 
wo.do. '= Wo. (17) 
if we identify do.' as the thickness of the layer containing the 
water depth Wo.. Multiplication of (16) by d•' then yields (2). 
Having now a prediction equation for w•, we may redefine 
(3a) to read 
qg = ot'q•.t(T•) + (1 - a')q,, q• < q•t(T•) (18a) 
The form similar to (!a) which E• takes upon using (18a) is 
E• = p•CuoU•a'[q•t(Tg) - q•] (18b) 
where 
a' - min (1, %/w•) (18c) 
For convenience, d•' in (15) has been taken to be constant 
and its dependence upon w• absorbed into C•. Thus C• de- 
creases with increasing w• in (13b), which corresponds to stage 
2 of a drying soil [Idso et al., 1974] and to the soil moisture 
diffusivity's being an increasing function of soil moisture con- 
tent. Equation ( ! 3a) corresponds tostage 1 (potential evapora- 
tion); (13c) corresponds to stage 3 (evaporation rate governed 
by vapor transfer and adsorption), except hat (18b) is not 
really applicable [Philip, 1957]. It is nevertheless u ed even in 
DEARDORFF: SOIL TEMPERATURES 1895 
stage 3, since the evaporation rate is then very small and its 
absolute error of estimate is also small. 
Equation (18a) does not give the unrealistic behavior that 
(3a) does of qg reaching its saturation value only when the 
mean soil moisture value W•. reaches its saturated value. In- 
stead, in (18a), local surface saturation can occur during mod- 
erate precipitation while w•. is still far below its critical or 
saturated value. Following cessation of precipitation, % in 
(12) starts dropping below Wmax owing to both evaporation 
and redistribution to the deeper soil and may even drop far 
below w2 during a sunny afternoon because of evaporation. 
Another advantage of using (12) is that the soil albedo may 
be formulated to be dependent upon %; the dependency is 
much more accurate and unique if wg is used rather than w•. 
[see Idso et al., 1975b]. 
It should be recognized that (18), although an improvement 
over (3a), still suffers the inconsistency that the height of 
evaluation of qa within the surface layer does not appear 
explicitly. 
The behavior of (12)-(16) and (18) will be examined by 
utilizing this set of equations in place of (1)-(3). However, a 
demonstration of the behavior will be postponed until the 
latter part of the next section. 
5. INCLUSION OF A LAYER OF VEGETATION 
a. The assumptions and parameterizaton. A singlelayer of 
vegetation which has negligible heat capacity is assumed to be 
present. Its density will be characterized by the single quantity 
at, which is an area average shielding factor associated with 
the degree to which the foliage prevents shortwave radiation 
from reaching the ground. The limits of ar ar e 0 < ar < 1, ar = 
O signifying o foliage and at = 1 signifying complete radiative 
blocking. Estimates of at for some different plant types ob- 
tained from Geiger [1965] are 0.82 for meadow grass, 0.95 for 
clover 30 cm high, 0.83 for winter rye 80 cm high, 0.30 for 
summer barley 12-15 cm high, 0.98 for a 3-m-high thicket of 
young elms with dense undergrowth in summer, 0.50 for the 
same thicket after the leaves have fallen, and from 0.4 to 0.98 
for various stands of either deciduous or evergreen trees. 
The canopy will be treated asa bulk layer, and it will 
necessary to distinguish between the heat or moisture transfer 
coefficient applicable to the ground surface underneath a can- 
opy CHg, that applicable to bare ground Clio, and that appli- 
cable to the top of a dense canopy CHh. The assumption will be 
made that for a dense canopy, CHg = CHh; the simplest inter- 
polation which will be used here for CHg in general is 
Cu = (1 - af)Cu + afCu (19) 
Within the canøpy the mean wind which both ventilates the 
foliage and promotes weak heat and moisture fluxes from the 
ground surface will be denoted by uar and prescribed by 
uar = 0.83arcu•/•'ua + (1 - ar)ua (20) 
In the absence of foliage this in-canopy wind is seen to revert 
to Ua and in the presence of dense foliage to become 0.83 
ß cun•/•'ua. The factor 0.83 comes from the studies reported by 
Legg and Long [1975], Thom [1972], Webb [1975], and Geiger 
[1965] with the considerations that within a relatively dense 
canopy, Uat is approximately 0.3 of the wind speed at foliage 
top height, the zero displacement height in the wind profile 
is about three fourths of the foliage top height, the roughness 
length is about one third of the difference between foliage top 
height and displacement height, and CHn•/•'Ua is roughly the 
friction velocity. 
The air in close proximity to the foliage is assumed to take 
on properties intermediate between above-canopy air proper- 
ties at z = Za, foliage surface properties, and ground surface 
properties: 
Tat = (1 - at)Ta + at(0.3Ta + 0.6Tt + 0.1Tg) (21a) 
qat = (1 - at)qa + at(O.3qa + 0.6qt + 0.1q•) (2lb) 
where Tat refers to the mean temperature of the air within the 
foliage, Tt is a representative temperature at the foliage surface 
itself, and qat and qt are analogous specific humidities. For- 
mula (21) prescribes Tat and qat to be the same as Ta and qa, 
respectively, in the absence of foliage; for maximum foliage 
cover they prescribe Tat and qat to be influenced still by above- 
canopy air as well as by the foliage and ground. The sum of the 
three coefficients in the last terms of (21) must be unity, and 
the foliage influence is made several times stronger than the 
ground influence because of the greater foliage surface area 
within a relatively dense canopy. There is little other informa- 
tion for guidance except from sensitivity studies which show 
little change in results if the present coefficients in the last 
terms of (21) are changed to (0.45, 0.45, 0.1). 
The sensible heat transfer from a representative leaf will be 
assumed to be given by 
Hlear = pacpctuat(Tt- Tat) (22a) 
where cf is a dimensionless heat transfer coefficient which 
takes into account both sides of the leaf and Tt is the represen- 
tative leaf temperature. If the net leaf area index N over some 
region is defined as the total one-sided leaf area of the foliage 
relative to the ground area of the same region, the expression 
for the net sensible heat flux from the foliage to the surround- 
ing air, Hsf, per unit horizontal ground area, is approximately 
Hsf = l.lNHlear = 1.1NpacpCtUat(Tt- Tat) (22b) 
The factor 1.1 roughly accounts for the effects of those stalks, 
stems, twigs, and limbs which exchange heat but do not tran- 
spire. 
The dimensionless heat transfer coefficient is assumed to be 
given by 
cf = 0.0111 + 0.3 (m s-•)/uat] (23) 
The value 0.01 is derived from the study of Kumar'and Bartha- 
kur [1971] for forced convection over several different types of 
plants. The other factor in (23) is a free convection enhance- 
ment; the general importance of free convection within the 
canopy has been emphasized by Allen and Lemon [1972]. 
There is obviously a rough relation between N and at, here 
assumed to be given by 
N = 7at (24) 
which is consistent with results reported in Allen and Lemon 
[1972] for a corn crop and by Monteith et al. [1965] for barley. 
N does not much exceed a number like 7 because there is then 
insufficient light to support additional growth within the can- 
opy. Although isolated trees may appear to have larger values 
of N, they usually do not when surrounding open space is 
taken into account. 
Generalizing from Monteith and Szeicz [1962], we find that 
the evaporation rate per unit area from a representative leaf, 
Elear, is 
E•r = pactuat[qsat(Tt) - qat]r" (25a) 
where 
r" = 1 - b•[rs/(r• + ra)] [1 - (Wd•w/Wdm•) TM] (25b) 
1896 DEARDORFF: SOIL TEMPERATURES 
represents the fraction of potential evaporation, be is a step 
function which is zero if condensation is occurring onto the 
leaf (if qar > qsat(Tr)) and is unity otherwise, rs is a generalized 
stomatal resistance and ra is the 'atmospheric resistance,' Waew 
is the mass of any liquid water retained on the foliage per unit 
ground area, and Wamax is the maximum value of Waew be- 
yond which runoff to the ground occurs. 
The net foliage evaporation rate per unit horizontal ground 
area, Er, is then 
Er = NE•ar = Np•cru•r[qs•t(Tr)- q•r]r " = r"(Er)pot (25c) 
where (E;)pot is the potential (maximum possible) foliage evap- 
oration rate. By definition of the leaf area index N the evapo- 
rahve resistance ofthe canopy is only 1/N as large as that of 
the representative leaf. 
With the inclusion of r" in (25c), E; may be seen to be the 
transpiration rate when be = 1 and no dew or retained water is 
present, to be the rate of condensation onto the foliage when be 
= 0, and to be the rate of transpiration plus evaporation of 
dew when be = 1 and Wa•w > 0. When evaporating dew is 
present, the fraction of the foliage surfaces coated with mois- 
ture is assumed to be given by (Wa•w/Wdmax)•'/8; the reason for 
the fractional exponent is explained later. For be = 1 and Wa•w 
= 0 (the usual daytime case), (25c) and (25b) together repre- 
sent the transpiration rate as formulated by Monteith and 
Szeicz. 
The transpiration rate itself, per unit ground area, is seen to 
be given by 
Err: be(Er)pot[r•/(rs + ra)] [1 - (Wdew/Wdmax) TM] (26) 
since the quantity in the second set of brackets represents the 
fractional foliage surface not covered by dew. 
The facts that many types of leaves transpire from only the 
underside and that older leaves transpire less than newer ones 
are supposed to be accounted for by a representative choice of 
generalized stomatal resistance 
2.0 (s cm-i)[Smax*/(S • 4- 0.03Smax •)
4- $ + (Wwi,t/ws) •'] (27) 
Smax * is the maximum noon incoming solar radiation which 
can be achieved, $ is a seasonal dependence, Wwi•t is a wilting 
point value of soil moisture relative to its saturated value, and 
ws = (0.9w•. + 0. l wg) is a soil moisture value in the root zon• 
assumed to lie closer to the bulk value w•. than to the surface 
value wg. The specified dependence of' rs upon solar radiation 
is suggested from studies of Cline and Campbell [1976] for 
forests, Waggoner and Reifsnyder [1968] for certain crops, and 
Monteith et al. [1965] for barley. The minimum value of 2 s 
cm-• is near the lower side of the range of values suggested by 
these investigators, by Fetcher [1976] for lodgepole pine, and 
by Monteith and Szeicz [1962] for various types of foliage 
when the difference between leaf resistance and canopy resis- 
tance is considered. The last term within the brackets of (27) is 
designed to give a strong enhancement to the transpirative 
resistance if ws drops close to or below Ww•t in magnitude. 
Besides the seasonal dependence, the two dependencies, day- 
light and }oil moisture, appear to be the most important [Cline 
and Campbell, 1976] of many factors involved in the trans- 
pirative resistance. In temperate latitudes, $ is set to zero 
during the growing season and to a value much larger than 
unity during the rest of the year. 
With this approach of Monteith and Szeicz the atmospheric 
resistance is simply 
r• = (cfuctf) -1 (28) 
since the transfer coefficient cf is defined with respect o the 
mean flow inside the foliage layer rather than to the mean flow 
above the foliage. 
The conservation equation for Wdew is taken to be 
r3Wd•w/r3t = alp- (El- Etr) 0 • Wdew --<Wdmax (29) 
since the difference, E; - Etr, just represents evaporation or 
condensation of liquid water from or onto the foliage surfaces. 
When dew is evaporating, E r - Err becomes (Wa•w/Wam•x) TM 
'(Er)pot. The reason for specifying a fractional power depen- 
dence upon Wa•w/Wam•x is to allow dew to evaporate more 
rapidly than it does at an exponentially decreasing rate; for 
unit exponent he dew would never quite disappear, while for 
zero exponent it would evaporate much too fast with the 
implication that the dew is present in a continuous thin film 
over the entire leaf as evaporation proceeds. Formulations 
(25b) and (29) are a compromise between those tw6 extreme 
positions and simulate the dew's occupying only a fraction of 
the leaf area during its evaporation and the entire area during 
its formation. 
Condensation which may occur on the soil surface is not 
treated as dew but is simply added to the bulk soil moisture 
budget. 
A gross energy budget for the foliage layer must be estab- 
lished in order to estimate Tr. The values at the top of the 
canopy being denoted by subscript h, those at the ground by 
subscript g, and the direction of radiative fluxes by arrows, the 
assumption of no canopy heat storage leads to 
S• • + R•.• - S• • - R• • - (S• + R• 
- Sg • - R6g •) = H•n- H•g + L(En- Eg) (30) 
where S is the shortwave and R• the longwave flux, H• the 
sensible heat, and E• the evapotranspiration as seen at level z 
= h. On the left side o[(30), S• and R• • are assumed known, 
while by definition of at, Sg • is given by 
Sg• = (1 - ar)S• * (31a) 
By definition of ag the reflected flux Sg • is given by 
Sg t = ag(1 - ar)Sn • (3lb) 
The upward longwave flux just above the ground, R•g •, is 
obtained by interpolating with at between the expression ap- 
plicable above bare soil and that applicable just above soil 
overlain with a dense canopy: 
R•.g t = (1 - ar)[•gaTg • + (1 - •g)R6n •] 
+ ar[•gaTg • + (1 - •g)•raTr •] /(•r + • - •r•g) (31c) 
For at = I this expression for R•g t reverts to that for the 
radiative flux between two parallel surfaces [Fleagle and Bus- 
inger, 1963] of emissivities •g and •r. For at = 0 the expression 
similarly accounts for the upward reflection of R• * from the 
ground when •g < 1. The three remaining radiative fluxes are 
similarly obtained: 
Sn • = (1 - ar)agSn • + ararS • • (31d) 
R6n = (1 - ar)[•gaTg • + (1 - •g)R•n•] 
+ ar[•raTr • + (1 - •r)R•n • ] (31e) 
R6g• = (1 - ar)R6n• + ar[•raTr • 
+ (1 - •r)•gaTg •] /(•r + • - •r•g) (31f)

which is to be solved for T r. It may be noted that a r in (32) can 
be cancelled from all terms (since the right-hand terms contain 
N, which contains at), allowing T r to be obtained even in the 
limit of just no foliage. It may also be noticed from (31d) that 
at i n (32) is the foliage albedo as would be measured with a 
radiometer above a dense canopy, so that variable leaf angle 
relative to the sun and to the zenith is incorporated within its 
definition. For er and eg close to unity the coefficient of the 
eraT ) term in (32) is about 2, which accords with the ex- 
pectation that the foliage layer emits longwave radiation both 
upward and downward. 
Within a sunlit canopy there will be a wide range of individ- 
ual leaf temperatures differing by as much as 12 K [Miller, 
1971], and the intent is for the leaf energy budget equation (32) 
to yield a representative value for T r, which taken along with 
the values for T• r, q•r, u•r, cr, N, and r• will yield the correct 
values for sensible heat flux and transpiration rate from foliage 
to air. 
The foliage surface specific humidity qr needed in'(21b) is 
obtained from 
qr = r"q•t(Tr) + (1 - r")q• r (33a) 
with the usual restriction 
qr • q•t(Tr) (33b) 
Expression (33a) is derived by equating Er from (25c) with the 
alternate expression involving qr: 
Er = Np•cru•r(qr- q•r) (34) 
Because of the ground cover the soil energy balance of (4) 
must be modified in order to obtain Tg needed in (32). With 
H•e denoting the sensible heat flux at the ground surface and 
Eg the evaporation rate there, we make the simplest possible 
generalization of (5) and (lb): 
H• = p•cvcngu•r(G- T•r) (35a) 
Es= p•cngu•r(qg - q•r) (35b) 
Equation (35) makes use of the property that (cng, u•r, T•r, q•r) 
• (cn0, u•, T•, q•) as at • 0; (35a) and (5) further neglect the 
small distinction between temperature and potential temper- 
ature differences within the foliage and atmospheric surface 
layers. 
The ground surface energy balance then becomes 
-G = H•g + LEg- (1 - ag)Sg* + R•g t - R•g* (36) 
with Se • given by (31a), R•g t by (31c), and R•g • by (31f). 
When the force restore method is used to get Tg, the soil 
surface heat flux -G in (36) replaces HA in (8) and in (9). 
The soil properties used in (8) and (9) appear to depend 
more upon soil moisture than soil type, and a parameterized 
dependence for X and pscs upon wg and w•. is therefore at- 
tempted, following Benoit [1976] and Sellers [1965]. At the 
ground surface and in the bulk mean, respectively, we parame- 
terize p•c• by 
(pc)• = 0.27 + w• calcm -•K -• (37) 
(pc)•. = 0.27 + w•. cal cm -• K -• 
and parameterize X = t)sc•K• and d• = (K•r•) •/•' by 
X• = 0.001 + 0.004(w•) •/• cal cm-• s-• K-• (38a) 
X•. = 0.001 + 0.004(w•.) TM cal cm -• s -• K -• 
= 
dx•. = [r•Xd(pc)4 •/•' (38b) 
Now, in (8) it is not clear hoxd best o define an optimal value 
of p•csd• when the ground surface soil properties differ signifi- 
cantly from the bulk soil properties. However, tests were 
made using the 12-layer soil model with wg/w•. being either 
a factor of 5 greater than or smaller than unity and with a 
logarithmic distribution of w with depth (linear distribution 
in the coordinate •'). Improved results were obtained by 
defining 
r' = 0.30 + O.05wg/w•. 0.3 < r' < 1 (39a) 
and utilizing 
p•c•d• = r'(pc)gd• + (1 - r')(pc)•.d•. (39b) 
Without this subparameterization and with only the use of the 
w•. moisture value, the root-mean-square rror in T• averaged 
over a day was 2.6 K relative to a diurnal range of 22.7 K when 
the surface was moist and 1.3 K relative to a diurnal range of 
21.4 K when the surface was dry. With the parameterization 
these errors were reduced to 0.6 and 0.9 K, respectively. Much 
more work is needed on this subject, however. 
The ground albedo ag is also made a function of ground 
surface moisture as follows: 
a• = 0.31 - O. 17w•/w• w• < wn 
(40) 
ag=0.14 w•> w• 
as suggested by the study of Idso et al. [1975b]. 
The quantity qg needed in (35b) and in (2lb) is obtained not 
from (18a) but from the slightly generalized equation 
q• = a'qsat(T•) + (1 - a')q•,r (41a) 
again provided that 
qg < qsat(T,) (4lb) 
The soil moisture budget equations are modified slightly 
from those in sections 1 and 4 to allow for the effect of 
transpiration: 
gwg/gt = -C•(Eg + O. 1Etr- Pg)/(pwd•') 
- C•.(wg - w•.)/r• (42) 
gw•./gt = -(Eg + Etr- Pg)/(pwdd) (43) 
where Pg is the precipitation rate felt at the ground surface: 
P• = P(1 - at) Wde w < Wdmax 
pg = p Wdew • Wdma x (44! 
1898 DEARDORFF: SOIL TEMPERATURES 
and C• and C•. are given by (13) and (14). Since most of the 
moisture supply for transpiration is considered to lie beneath 
the uppermost layer of relative moisture content we, only 0.1 
of Etr is allowed to influence we in (42). In (43), moisture 
transpiring from the foliage is considered to be piped directly 
from the bulk layer of mean content w•., while that condensing 
onto the foliage at night is assumed to remain in situ (unless 
Wdew > Wdm,x) until eventual evaporation. 
The main purpose for the development of the equations in 
this section is to obtain modified expressions for the vertical 
fluxes from the ground foliage system to the atmosphere. 
These are the sensible heat flux Hsh - Hse + Hsr, given from 
(35a) and (22b) as 
Hs/• = paCoCueUar(Te- Tar)+ 1.1NpacoCrUar(Tr- Tar) (45) 
the evapotranspiration rate Ea = E s + Er, given from (35b) 
and (25c) as 
En = paCueUar(qe -- qar) + NpacrUar[q•,,t(Tr) - q•r]r" (46) 
and the upward directed shortwave radiative flux S•t from 
(31d) and upward directed longwave flux Ru, T from (31e). 
An outline of the method of solution which will be used for 
obtaining these vertical fluxes is as follows: 
1. Specify at, along with soil and foliage roughness, 
initial conditions, above-canopy air properties, and incoming 
radiative fluxes or precipitation; calculate N from (24) and cu 
from (19). 
2. Calculate as from (40), Uar from (20), cr from (23), ra 
from (28), rs from (27), and r" from (25b). 
3. Using qs•t(Tr) and qar from the previous time step, 
diagnose qr from (33). Here a more economical method of 
calculatiog qs•t may be employed than that in section 2, where 
testing of a large time step precluded stepping along the 
C!ausius-Clapeyron equation. 
4. Diagnoseqarfrom(21b)andqefrom(41),thetwobeing 
solved simultaneously, and Tar from (21a). Previous values of 
Tr, Te, qr, and qe are utilized. 
5. Diagnose Tr from the foliage energy budget equation 
(32) by using a time step linearization of the outgoing long- 
wave radiation term and foliage saturation humidity term as 
described in section 2. 
6. Obtain pscsd• from (37)-(39) and the components of G 
from (31a), (31f), and (35), and then obtain G from (36). 
7. Predict updated values for T e by the force restore 
method (8), and T•. from (9), by using G from step 6.

b. Test of the vegetation layer parameterization. A partial 
test is made by simulating the conditions reported by Penman 
and Long [ 1960] within a dense wheat crop in England on June 
4-5, 1955. It is incomplete because measurements of at, soil 
moisture, soil temperatures, mean foliage radiometric temper- 
ature, evapotranspiration, heat flux, and radiation balance 
during this period were not made or reported and because 
sampling errors of temperature and humidity within the crop 
can be appreciable. 
There-was apparently little or no cloudiness during this 
period, and solar radiation appropriate for latitude 51.8øN, 
attenuated by 15% to allow for absorption by ozone, water 
vapor, and dust, is prescribed. Parameters w e and w• are 
assumed to be 0.20 and 0.25 initially, wn to be 0.30, Wm•x to be 
1.33w•, and Ww•t to be 0.10. Soil properties are taken from (37) 
and (38) and, for w e • 0.25, agree well with those reported by 
the authors for their site in 1956. Initially (hour 18), T e was 
taken as 286.6 K and Tz as 282 K. Wam•x was set to 0.1at g 
The wheat crop was extra thick and about 31 cm high. 
Although Penman and Long mention that it was typical of a 
canopy which completely shades the ground, it is assumed 
here, on the basis of earlier discussion of at, that at was 0.75. 
The values of Cno and cna, referred to a height of 2 m, are taken 
to be 0.0057 and 0.0096; the corresponding roughness lengths 
are 1 and 3 cm, respectively, with a zero displacement height 
within foliage of 23 cm. Emissivities are assigned the values •t 
= •g = 0.95 and for albedo, at = 0.20 and ag as taken from 
(40). 
Air temperatures, specific humidity, and wind speed at the

4, are specified from Penman and Long's Figure 2. During this

rainfall between hours 18 and 22, accompanied then by over- 
cast skies and a relative humidity of 95%. The numerical 
integration utilized a 10-min time step. 
The diurnal variation of Tg calculated for the 2-day period 
for at = 0.75 is shown in Figure 3; included are calculated Tg 
values obtained for a t = 0, 0.5, and 1.0 for comparison, all else 
being held the same, and observational estimates from Penman

downward extrapolations from nickel resistance thermometer 
measurements at 5.0 and 30 cm except in three instances 
(circled crosses) which make use also of measurements at 2.5 
and 7.5 cm. Although neither the model nor the measurements 
are so good that the crosses fall along any particular a t curve, 
the value of 0.75 selected for a t yields satisfactory Ts values 
overall. The observed maximum at hour 10 seems peculiar but 
could be associated with the microdensity of the wheat canopy 
in the immediate vicinity of the instruments in relation to the 
solar azimuth angle. The parameterization predicts a 2.5-fold 
reduction in the diurnal range of T• from at = 0 to at = 1 and 
a corresponding lag in the time of the occurrence of peak

ground temperature of about 1 hour. The maximum bare 
ground temperature is 5 K less on the second day than on the 
first because of the effect of simulated rainfall during the 
intervening evening. 
The diurnal variations calculated for Tr, T,r, Ts, and the 
prescribed variation of T, are shown in Figure 4, and those for 
qt, qat, qg, and qa are shown in Figure 5, all for at = 0.75. 
The representative foliage temperature is seen to exceed 
substantially the maximum value which Tg reaches during 
midday but to be up to 5 ø cooler than Ts for bare soil. Tt 
exceeds the surrounding air temperature T•t by up to 2 K. This 
result is consistent with data compiled by Geiger [1965, Fig- 
ures 136 and 137] and observations [Waterhouse, 1955] which 
show the air near the top of a crop during the day to be 
warmer than either the air above or the ground below. The air 
must therefore have been heated by foliage considerably 
warmer than itself. However, this conclusion has been dis- 
puted by Lomas et al. [1971], and the difficulty in obtaining 
representative measurements is probably responsible for the 
uncertainty. If the model is rerun with the stomatal resistance 
increased by a factor of !00, but with all else the same, the 
maximum foliage temperature reaches a value 5.5 K warmer 
(12.0 K warmer for at = 1), which is an example of 'foliage 
fever.' 
A downward jump in Tt is discernible in Figure 4 just 
following the simulated rainfall; this is associated with the 
decrease in downcoming longwave radiation after the skies 
clear. 
Figure 5 shows that qt becomes less than qs and q•r at night, 
thus promoting condensation onto the foliage, while qt ex- 
ceeds qg during the early morning hours. The peak between 
hours 18 and 21 of June 5 is caused by the simulated rainfall 
which wets both the foliage and ground. The peak in qt be- 
tween 0700 and 0930 on June 6 is associated with warming9œ 
the extra-wet foliage before the retained water evaporates. 
Other wiggles are associated with variations in the observed 
values of q,, T,, and u, utilized. 
A sensitive measure of the performance of the parameter- 
ization is the temperature difference Ts - T,,t, since T, and T,t 
each comprises rather independent elements of the model. This 
difference is shown in Figure 6 for .at = 0, 0.5, and 1.0 as well 
as for 0.75. Estimated values from the observations (crosses

surements at a height of 30 cm utilized as a measure of Tar. 
Although predicted differences are seen to be critically depen- 
dent upon at, the constant value of ar = 0.75 captures the 
observed behavior fairly well in both phase and magnitude. 
We see that the sensible heat transfer from ground to canopy is 
positive at night and negative in the daytime, just opposite 
from the behavior experienced over bare ground. 
A similar plot of the vapor pressure difference, e• - ear, is 
shown in Figure 7. Here the ar = 0.75 curve agrees even closer 
with the observations than could be expected. The positive 
values of the difference at night mean that part of the dew 
formation then comes from moisture supplied from the 
ground, a process called 'distillation' by Monteith [1957]. 
Predicted values of w e, w:, and Wde w during the 48-hour 
period for ar = 0.75 are presented in Figure 8. Predicted 
dewfall commences at 2240 (sunset being calculated for 2016), 
and Waew reaches a maximum value of 0.08 mm per unit 
ground area by sunrise (predicted for 0408 h). Although the 
dewfall was not measured, Penman and Long stated that the 
night of June 4-5 at their site 'was one of exceptionally intense 
dew formation,' heavy dew being characterized by 0.15 mm or 
more [Long, 1958]. (For ar = 1 the predicted dewfall reached 
0.16 mm.) Evaporation of the dew is predicted to have oc- 
curred by 0740 for ar = 0.75. 
Although the ground is emitting moisture at night while the 
foliage is receiving it, the rate of dew accumulation is predicted 
to exceed Eg more and more as the night proceeds. Shortly 
after onset of dew, Eg exceeded the dew accumulation rate, but 
by 0400 the latter exceeded Ee by a factor of 16. Distillation 
was therefore unimportant after the first hour of dewfall. If the

model is rerun with all wind speeds doubled but all else the 
same, the maximum dew accumulation is 7% less. This result 
can be traced mainly to a potential for increased dewfall 
through increased turbulent mixing to be more than com- 
pensated by warmer foliage at night and a smaller difference in 
qar - q, at(Tr). 
The ground surface moisture framion, % in Figure 8, is 
predicted to decrease considerably between 0800 and 1800 on 
June 5 owing to evapotranspiration, but the amount of de- 
crease for bare soil under similar conditions is very marked. 
During the simulated rainy period, % quickly increases be- 
yond the saturated value. Following cessation of the rain the 
restoring term in (42) causes the soil surface moisture content 
to decrease slowly, as does evaporation the following day. The 
retained rainwater on the foliage starts disappearing after sun- 
rise, but because of the increased amount in comparison with 
dewfall it is not predicted to vanish until 0940 on June 6. 
The evapotranspiration rate Eh of (46) is shown in Figure 9 
for this case of ar = 0.75 and also for ar = 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. 
Unfortunately, there is no observational check from Penman 
and Long, except hat the net value predicted over the first 24- 
hour interval, which is 0.43 cm, lies within the range of values 
0.33-0.61 cm that they found using a large field balance during 
June 12-19, 1957, with generally clear skies for a wheat crop at 
the same site. It may be mentioned that the net 24-hour eva- 
potranspiration is predicted to be 1.9 times larger for a r = 1 
than for ar = 0, all else being held constant. This result follows 
from the enhanced ryness of the soil surface which develops 
during the day in the absence of foliage. To capture this effect, 
a model needs to include both a foliage parameterization and a 
prediction of soil surface moisture content as in (12). The 
skewness of the daytime June 5 Ee curve for ar = 0 is also 
caused by the progressive drying of the soil surface and is 
typical of stage 2 evaporation [Idso et al., 1974]. 
If ua is doubled in this test of the model, while all else is 
being held the same, the net 24-hour evapotranspiration for ar 
= 0.75 is found to be increased from 0.43 to only 0.49 cm. This 
somewhat surprising result stems from the foliage surfaces' 
being about 2 K cooler, owing to increased ventilation (and 
transpiration), and this leads to a correspondingly greater 
reduction in leaf surface saturation humidity due to its non- 
linear temperature dependence. 
If the stomatal resistance is halved and all else is held 
constant, the net 24-hour evapotranspiration for ar = 0.75 is 
found to increase from 0.43 to 0.51 cm. If rs is increased by 
50%, the net 24-hour evapotranspiration isfound to decrease 
from 0.43 to 0.38 cm. 
For a r = 0 a pronounced peak in Eh occurs during the 
simulated rainy period (Figure 9) when the ground becomes 
wet while it is still relatively warm. The bare soil evaporation 
rate is seen to be much increased on the day following the 
simulated rain, whereas the transpiration rate is little affected. 
DEARDORFF: SOIL TEMPERATURES 1901 
The sensible heat flux to the atmosphere, Hsn in (45), is 
shown in Figure 10 for the same four values of at. An upward 
spike occurs briefly at the beginning of the rainfall period, 
associated with increased downward longwave radiation to 
which the foliage quickly responds. If this rainfall is not simu- 
lated, the maximum sensible heat flux over the bare soil in- 
creases by 12% on the second day in comparison with the first 
and then exceeds Hsn for at = 0.75 by 78%. 
The investigation of Penman and Long was not designed for 
the purpose of obtaining the sensible heat flux, and as a gross 
check of the H,n values obtained here the Bowen ratio (H,n/ 
LEn) is compared with Bowen ratios measured by Black and 
McNaughton [1971] above a young Douglas fir forest in British 
Columbia in summer. This comparison can be made because 
there is little in this parameterization to distinguish a field of 
grass from a forest. The present model is seen to predict 
Bowen ratios in rough agreement with those measured above 
the forest, as indicated by Figure 11. Daytime values of Bowen 
ratio near • over meadowland on clear days in spring and 
summer are reported by Geiger. One estimate of Bowen ratio 
from the data of Penman and Long can be made for 1000-1100 
h, June 5, and is 0.48 + 0.15; at that time the model gives a 
value of 0.62 for at = 0.75. Hence the model prediction of 
appears reasonable. 
c. Discussion of t)egetation parameterization. Although 
there are some existing foliage models [Paltridge, 1970; Wag- 
goner and Reifsnyder, 1968], these are multilayer (e.g., eight 
layers within the foliage) and do not treat the fluxes from the 
soil surface underneath the canopy nor allow the canopy den- 
sity to approach small values. 
The present parameterization has purposely been kept ex- 
tremely simple, from the viewpoint of an agricultural meteor- 
ologist, so that it might be useful to atmospheric modelers who 
cannot afford to become too entwined in a host of vegetative 
canopy details. Another reason for the simplicity is that the 
parameterization should be capable of working reasonably 
well for a given large-scale shielding factor, whether the foliage 
cover is homogeneous in space with at = 0.5 or is very dense 
over half the area and nonexistent over the other half. Because 
of the linear interpolations upon a t built into this parameter- 
ization, it is subject to either interpretation of the foliage 
distribution. 
The additional computer running time required of this pa- 
rameterization is not great. The numerical program which 
involves prediction of the vegetation layer properties as well as 
of Tgtr, T•., Wg, and W•. was found to require only 1.5 times the 
computer time of a similar program stripped of all vegetative 
canopy and related statements. (Both programs were stripped 
of all superfluous or output statements.) The parameterization 
could therefore be made considerably more comprehensive 
without acquiring excessive computer requirements. Addi- 
tional foliage variables requiring computer storage are T 
Wdew, and qat. Presumably at will also be a variable which 
could be made a function of season and location (or latitude, 
elevation, seasonal soil moisture, and land use). 
It is perhaps worth mentioning some of the considerations 
omitted from this parameterization. These include effects of 
stratification or free convection upon both cH0 and CHh; influ- 
ence of different types of canopy, for given at, upon mean 
wind, temperature, humidity, thermal radiation, and leaf area 
index within the canopy; different rates at which air within the 
canopy may be modified in temperature and humidity; influ- 
ence of solar elevation angle upon at, at, and a•; dependence 
of liquid water retention upon canopy height and type; influ- 
ence of soil water potential and of atmospheric temperature 
and humidity upon stomatal resistance; influence of soil prop- 
erties upon the prediction of wg; interaction of snowfall with a 
foliage layer, and effects of a thin layer of organic litter atop 
the soil. 
As the parameterization now stands, its chief components 
subject to tuning are two of the three factors which sum to 
unity in (21a) and (2lb), the stomatal factor 2 s cm -• appear- 
ing in (27), the factor 0.83 in (20), the factor 7 for the maxi- 
mum leaf area index in (24), and the values assigned to ct, at, 
Wdm,x, and Wwl•t. To a certain extent, different types or combi- 
nations of canopies could be represented by somewhat differ- 
ent values of these parameters. 
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Bhumralkar's [1975] and Blackadar's [1976] 'force restore' 
method of predicting ground surface temperature has been 
tested against five other approximate methods that are about 
equally efficient numerically and do not require calculation of 
multiple soil layer temperatures. In cases with substantial diur- 
nal solar forcing this force restore method is found in general 
to be superior to the other methods. When the atmospheric 
forcing has a substantial random component to it, the in- 
sulated surface assumption is found to be especially poor. If no 
substantial diurnal forcing is present, the force restore method 
is still found to be superior to the insulated surface method. 
The procedure of relating the soil heat flux to either the sen- 
sible heat flux or the net radiative flux yields surface temper- 
atures of intermediate but surprisingly acceptable accuracy if 
the time step does not exceed 10 or 20 min. 
A method is presented for predicting ground surface mois- 
ture which is analogous to the force restore method of predict- 
ing surface temperature. The specific humidity at the surface is 
then related to the ground surface moisture content rather 
than to the bulk soil moisture content as is present practice. 
This permits evaporation to dry out the ground surface and so 
reduce the evaporation rate from bare soil in comparison with 
evapotranspiration. Also the method permits the new variable, 
ground surface moisture, to be treated with comparable care 
and time scale resolution as is afforded ground surface temper- 
ature. 
A simple parameterization for a vegetation layer is devel- 
oped and tested against observations of Penman and Long 
[1960] and others. It involves solution of an abbreviated en- 
ergy budget equation to obtain the temperature of a represen- 
tative foliage element and diagnosis of mean air temperature 
and humidity within the vegetation layer. The force restore 
method is utilized to calculate ground surface temperature and 
moisture. With no shielding of the ground from solar radiation 
(at = 0), one recovers the bare soil values of ground temper- 
ature and surface heat flux. With complete shielding (at = 1) 
the diurnal ground surface temperature wave is strongly 
damped but is still present because of heat and moisture ex- 
change between the ground and the vegetation. With inter- 
mediate shielding of at = 0.75 in simulation of the data of 
Penman and Long [ 1960], the difference between in-canopy and 
ground surface temperature and the corresponding difference 
in vapor pressure are predicted surprisingly well during the 
course of a day. The evapotranspiration rate above a dense 
foliage layer is predicted to exceed the bare soil evaporation 
rate by a factor of about 2, while the sensible heat flux in the 
afternoon over bare soil can typically exceed that over the 
foliage by a similar factor. There is therefore strong need to 
make use of a simple parameterization of the vegetation layer 
1902 DEARDORFF: SOIL TEMPERATURES 
if one wishes to improve upon the method of calculating 
ground surface temperature and at the same time predict more 
accurate fluxes to the atmosphere. 
The introduction of this vegetation parameterization does 
add some 50% to the computer time otherwise necessary for 
calculating the bulk plus ground surface values of temperature 
and moisture. However, this modest expansion of a minor part 
of an atmospheric prediction model seems fully warranted in 
view of the gross errors which can occur when the foliage layer 
is ignored. Introduction of a foliage layer which may have 
variable density and an albedo different from that of the 
ground seems mandatory for testing a climate theory like that 
of Charhey et al. [1975], for example, which involves inter- 
actions between surface albedo, soil moisture, large-scale 
weather and precipitation, and crop type and amount. In their 
paper, Charhey et al. do point out the need for including a 
model of the biosphere within the atmosvheric model.
