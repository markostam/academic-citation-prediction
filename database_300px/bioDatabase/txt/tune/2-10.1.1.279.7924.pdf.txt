ABSTRACT
Hybridization using overgo probes is an established
approach for screening arrayed bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) libraries. We have improved the
use of overgos by increasing the yield of positive
clones using reduced levels of radioisotopes and
enzyme. The strategy involves labeling with all four
radiolabeled nucleotides in a hot pulse followed
by a cold nucleotide chase and then extending the
exposure time to compensate for reduced specific
activity of the probes. The resulting cost savings
and reduced human exposure to radiation make the
use of highly pooled overgo probes a more attrac-
tive approach for screening of BAC libraries from
organisms with large genomes.
INTRODUCTION
Many economically important plants and animals have a gen-
ome size that is beyond the current limits of whole-genome
sequencing due to cost considerations and difficulties in the
assembly of repetitive sequences. For example, hexaploid
bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has one of the larger geno-
mes at 17 000 Mb, with diploid barley (Hordeum vulgare) at
5300 Mb (1), the genome of each species having at least 80%
repetitive DNA (2). Strategies that focus on targeted sequenc-
ing of gene-rich regions provide an alternative to whole-
genome sequencing. Identification of gene-rich sequences in
species with large genomes (3) usually is accomplished by
methylation filtration (MF), high Cot selection, hybridization-
based approaches (4,5) or PCR. MF and high Cot methods
have been applied to maize (6,7) and sorghum (8,9).
Hybridization-based screening is performed against gridded
macroarrays or combinatorial pools of usually bacterial artifi-
cial chromosome (BAC) libraries using radioactively labeled
probes either singly or as groups. Several types of probes are
used for screening BAC libraries by hybridization (10); the
most commonly used are sub-cloned DNA fragments, PCR
amplified products (11) or DNA oligonucleotides (12). Probes
can be individually radiolabeled, then pooled and hybridized
as a group. Some drawbacks to probe pooling are non-
uniform radiolabeling of the probes and the risk of repetitive
elements that may confound the results by hybridization to
sequences that are abundant in the genome. The use of
oligonucleotides can minimize these issues by selecting
oligos after considering an entire sequence database (13).
The ‘overgo’ method of oligonucleotide probes begins by
annealing two 24-base or 22-base oligonucleotides with an
8 bp overlapping region and filling in the overhanging
bases with Klenow enzyme and radiolabeled nucleotides
(14). The resulting probes can be multiplexed and designed
to have thermodynamic behavior more uniform than other
types of DNA probes. Other advantages of overgos include
low background hybridization and simplified tracking
because oligos can be synthesized in an orderly and uniform
manner. Overgos have been used to screen libraries for physi-
cal maps in human (15), mouse (16), rice (17), chicken (18),
maize (19), sorghum (20) and peanut (21). Overgos have
been used also to screen PAC, fosmid and cosmid libraries,
close gaps between sequenced BAC clones in rice (22),
anchor BAC contigs (17) and screen rice fosmid libraries to
validate genome coverage (23). In animal systems, overgos
have been used to identify gene families such as immuno-
globulin H chain constant (IGHC) genes in horse (24), for
multispecies comparative sequence analysis (25), and as uni-
versal probes for the isolation of orthologous regions from
multiple vertebrates (26), especially mammalian or avian/
reptilian libraries. Overgos have been designed from various
sources including expressed sequence tag sequences, RFLP
markers, STS markers, BAC-end sequences and telomeric-
specific regions (27). The use of overgos as gene-specific
hybridization probes in combination with efficient pooling
strategies has proven to be a powerful approach in anchoring
large numbers of cDNA unigenes to BAC contig maps.
Examples are 9371 overgos in maize (19), 56 overgos desi-
gned from the RGA sequences of peanut (21) and 648
overgos designed from mapped STS markers in chicken
(28). Also, 7573 and 2297 overgos in sorghum and rice,
respectively, were used to explore the micro-synteny patterns
between the two species (20).

has practical limitations when extrapolated to a large number

of overgos probed in a single hybridization; it becomes
very costly and requires a problematic level of human
exposure to radioisotopes when used for screening a large
genome such as barley. In our effort to identify the majority
of gene-rich BAC clones from the barley genome, we modi-
fied the pooled overgo strategy to achieve a higher efficiency
of clone identification. Here we present the details of these
modifications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Barley BAC library
A barley BAC library was constructed by Yu et al. (29) for
cultivar Morex using the restriction endonuclease HindIII.
This library contains 313 344 clones (816 384-well plates)
and provides 6.3 haploid genome equivalents. The average
insert size is 106 kb. The library is arrayed on 17 DNA filters
with 18 432 clones represented per filter and is available from
Clemson University Genomics Institute (http://www.genome.
clemson.edu), which was our source.
Overgo probe design
Ten overgos related to abiotic stress were designed using
Overgo Maker (http://genome.wustl.edu/tools/software/
overgo.cgi). These sequences are given in Supplementary
Table 1. Source sequences for overgo design were unigene
consensus sequences, derived from ESTs, in HarvEST:Barley
(http://www.harvest.ucr.edu). Each overgo was composed of
a pair of oligonucleotides whose ends were complementary
by eight bases.
Overgo primer pairs
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO). Each oligonucleotide was synthesized as a
24mer at a 25 nmol scale and dissolved in 250 ml of TE buf-
fer. Oligonucleotide pairs were made by combining equal
amounts of each 24mer and diluting in TE to a final concen-
tration of 1 mM of each oligonucleotide. These overgo primer
pairs were stored at 20C.
Overgo probe labeling, hybridization, autoradiography
The optimized method was adapted from a protocol obtained
from John McPherson (Washington University, St Louis,
MO). Ten microliter of each probe pair mix was labeled
with 10 ml of freshly prepared master mix composed of
4.0 ml of 5· overgo labeling buffer (OLB; adds 5 pmol of
each of four cold nucleotides, see Supplementary Data for
complete composition of OLB), 1.0 ml of 2 mg/ml acetylated
BSA (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.125 ml of each of four
[a-32P]dNTPs (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer,
Wellesley, MA), 3.8 ml of distilled water and 0.2 ml of
2 U/ml Klenow enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA). An overgo primer pair with sequences 50-AACGGGC-
GAGTGATGTAAAATA-30 and 50-TGATGGGATCGGGC-
TATTTTAC-30 matching the Escherichia coli genome was
used in each pool as a background probe to lightly mark all
clones for alignment of the image (15). Labeling reactions
were carried out in a humidified acrylic box at room tempera-
ture for 1 h followed by addition of 5 ml of the a cold chase
solution (cold dNTPs) (15). Later, all the reactions were
pooled and probes were denatured at 95C for 5 min and
immediately transferred to hybridization tubes containing
prehybridized BAC membranes. Hybridization was perfor-
med in 40 ml of Church’s buffer (14) at 60C overnight in
a hybridization oven. After hybridization, membranes were
washed in solutions with increasing stringency starting with
2 l of 4· SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by 2 l of 1.5· SSC,
0.1% SDS and finally 2 l of 0.75· SSC, 0.1% SDS at
50C. Membranes were then sealed in plastic wrap and
exposed to film (Kodak BIOMAX MS Double Emulsion,
24 cm · 30 cm) with an intensifying screen (BioPlus Screens
10 inch · 12 inch, bioWorld, Dublin, OH) over the film at
80C for 5–6 days. During exposure at 80C, lead sheets
(0.015 inch thickness) were placed between the cassettes in
order to shield the radiation across the filters. The cassettes
were clamped between 3/4 inch plywood frames. For more
details refer to the Supplementary Data.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our motivations to optimize the overgo probe method were to
minimize the cost of and human exposure to radiation when
probing 10 000 or more overgo probes in batches of 192 at a
time, and to maximize the discovery rate of gene-positive
BAC clones per overgo. The original procedure of Ross
et al. (14) labeled the overgo primer pairs (20 pmol each)
with two radioactive nucleotides [a-32P]dATP and
[a-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 1 ml) in the presence of dGTP and
dTTP and 2 U of Klenow enzyme. When these quantities
were scaled up to our target of 192 probes the amounts of
radioisotopes and Klenow were impractical. Screening the
17-filter barley BAC library with 192 pooled overgos using
the standard overgo labeling method of Ross et al. (14)
would require the handling of nearly four mCi of radioacti-
vity and 400 U of Klenow enzyme for each probing. In
order to evaluate the sensitivity and efficiency of various
permutations of the labeling and hybridization protocol, we
used 10 overgo primer pairs. The variables that we tested
included cold chase (15) versus no cold chase, four versus
two radionucleotides, hybridization time, presence versus
absence of an E.coli genome overgo, and concentrations of
Klenow enzyme and oligonucleotides.
As noted by Han et al. (15) the concentration of each radio-
isotope in the standard labeling reaction is only 0.165 mM,
which is insufficient to support complete filling of overgos.
This was a significant issue for us since any reduction of
radionucleotide concentration, as we desired for cost reduc-
tions, would further impede the completion of overgo filling.
To generate complete overgos, Han et al. (15) implemented a
cold nucleotide chase. We investigated the effect of the cold
chase on the hybridization results using the otherwise stan-
dard 2 nt protocol and observed an increase in signal intensity
(data not shown). Once this observation was made, the cold
chase became an essential part of further modifications. In
addition, we noted that 2 U of Klenow enzyme in the standard
overgo labeling reaction is in excess. One unit is defined as
the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the incorporation
of 10 nmol of dNTP in 30 min at 37C. Complete fill-in of
32 nt (16 per strand) on 0.01 nmol of substrate (10 ml of
e5 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 1 PAGE 2 OF 5
1 mM concentration) would be only 3.2% of this load. Even if
the enzyme activity at room temperature is only 1/3 of the
activity at 37C then 2 U still must be an excess. We reduced
the amount of enzyme 5-fold (from 2 to 0.4 U per labeling
reaction) and observed no effect on the hybridization results
(data not shown), so this reduction in Klenow enzyme also
became a standard part of our protocol.
We compared hybridization signals detected by labeling
with 0.5 ml of each all 4 nt ([a-32P]dATP, [a-32P]dCTP,
[a-32P]dGTP, [a-32P]dTTP) keeping the amount of radio-
activity the same (20 mCi) as in the standard two-radioisotope
protocol, hybridizing to eight library filters containing
147 456 BAC clones. The number of clones detected was much
higher in the four-radioisotope procedure (Table 1). There
were 8.4 positive BAC clones per filter identified using the
four-isotope mixture as compared to 5.8 BAC clones per filter
detected by the same set of 10 overgos under the two-isotope
labeling procedure, a 45.6% increase. We then examined
the consequences of lower amounts of radioactivity in the
labeling reactions including 10, 5 and 2 mCi (Table 1).
With 10 mCi the two-isotope reaction yielded 4.4 BACs per
filter whereas the four-isotope reaction yielded 5.4 clones
per filter, a 23% higher yield. With 5 mCi the two-isotope
reaction (Figure 1) yielded 6.3 BACs per filter whereas the
four-isotope reaction yielded 7.5 clones per filter, a 19%
higher yield. With 2 mCi the results of the two-isotope and
four-isotope reactions were nearly the same as each other
and the required exposure times were too lengthy to be prac-
tical. Therefore, reduction to 2 mCi was judged to be unsatis-
factory. In addition, higher numbers of positive clones were
scored when four radionucleotides were used in the labeling
reactions as compared to two radionucleotides in other
hybridizations that used lower concentrations of oligos
(2 and 5 pmol), but the reduction of oligo concentration to
these levels reduced the total number of positive clones and
necessitated longer exposure times (data not shown) and
was therefore also judged to be unsatisfactory.
The method that seemed most optimal for our purposes
uses one-fourth of the radioactivity (reduced from 20 to
5 mCi per 20 ml reaction; 0.125 ml of each radioactive
dNTP at 10 mCi/ml), half the primer concentration (reduced
from 20 to 10 pmol) and one-fifth of the Klenow enzyme
(reduced from 2 to 0.4 U per reaction) (Table 2) relative to
the standard method. The other modifications include a
change in the composition of OLB such that it contains a
small amount of all four cold dNTPs for the initial labeling
reaction (see Materials and Methods, and Supplementary
Data), addition of a 1 h cold chase with 0.2 mM of each
dNTP to extend the overgos to their full length, an increase
in the hybridization time from overnight to 36 h and a longer
exposure time from 2–3 to 5–6 days. The increase in hybridi-
zation time from overnight to 36 h and longer exposure
time of 5–6 days were incorporated only for convenience
of the weekly workflow in a large-scale screening project.
We did not observe any significant effect of the longer
hybridization time. The contrast between positive clones
and background was satisfactory with either exposure time.
These optimizations all were in the context of using X-ray
films for autoradiography, so the use of phosphorimagers,
chemiluminescence or other modes of detection may
require some other considerations. The detailed modified
protocol for pooled overgo hybridization is provided as
Supplementary Data.
The rationale behind using all four radionucleotides was
that this would help to equalize the intensity of all probes
by reducing the influence of nucleotide frequency. This was
expected to have two favorable consequences. One was that
our overgo design algorithm would not have to take into con-
sideration the frequency and exact position of any particular
nucleotide in order to generate an acceptable 36mer, with the
consequence being more likelihood that we could choose oli-
gos with comparable thermodynamic behaviour. The other
was that the intensity of hybridization among overgos
would tend be more equal than would be possible with
fewer than four radionucleotide, thus minimizing the number
of probes that fail simply due to a relative paucity of label.
BACs hybridized with such overgos might then not be
observed as positives. We recently applied this modified
method to the identification of gene-bearing BAC clones of
barley using 12 600 overgos. In 70 pools ranging from
96 to 300 simultaneous probes, most often 192 probes per
pool, 65 000 gene-rich BACs were identified. On average
6.7 clones were identified for all the overgos hybridized,

aThe expected number of positives based on library depth would be
3.7 per filter for single-gene-specific probes; not all probes were specific to
a single gene.

which is in close accordance with the 6.3· genome coverage
of this library.
With many plant and animal species in early phases of
genome sequencing and physical mapping, the use of meth-
ods that are cost-efficient, sensitive and safe are desirable.
The procedure described here improves the cost-effectiveness
and reduces the radiation exposure hazards of detecting BAC
clones en masse using overgo probes. In essence we have
made an already-reliable method even better.
