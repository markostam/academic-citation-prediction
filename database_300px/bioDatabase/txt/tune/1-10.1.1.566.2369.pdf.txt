Aim Mechanical forces are important regulators of cell and tissue phenotype. We hypothesized
that mechanical loading and boundary conditions would inﬂuence neovessel activity during
angiogenesis.
Methods and resuts Using an in vitro model of angiogenesis sprouting and a mechanical loading system,
we evaluated the effects of boundary conditions and applied loading. The model consisted of rat micro-
vessel fragments cultured in a 3D collagen gel, previously shown to recapitulate angiogenic sprouting
observed in vivo. We examined changes in neovascular growth in response to four different mechanical
conditions. Neovessel density, diameter, length and orientation were measured from volumetric confo-
cal images of cultures exposed to no external load (free-ﬂoating shape control), intrinsic loads (ﬁxed
ends, no stretch), static external load (static stretch), or cyclic external load (cyclic stretch). Neoves-
sels sprouted and grew by the third day of culture and continued to do so during the next 3 days of
loading. The numbers of neovessels and branch points were signiﬁcantly increased in the static
stretch group when compared with the free-ﬂoating shape control group. In all mechanically loaded
cultures, neovessel diameter and length distributions were heterogeneous, whereas they were homo-
geneous in shape control cultures. Neovessels were signiﬁcantly more oriented along the direction
of mechanical loading than those in the shape controls. Interestingly, collagen ﬁbrils were organized
parallel and adjacent to growing neovessels.
Conclusion Externally applied boundary conditions regulate neovessel sprouting and elongation
during angiogenesis, affecting both neovessel growth characteristics and network morphometry.
Furthermore, neovessels align parallel to the direction of stress/strain or internally generated
traction, and this may be because of collagen ﬁbril alignment induced by the growing neovessels
themselves.

1. Introduction
Physiological organ morphology is achieved by migration
and orientation of cells under the inﬂuence of chemotaxis,
haptotaxis, and mechanotaxis. Both externally applied
and internally generated mechanical forces inﬂuence
cell migratory, proliferative, and secretory activities
and matrix orientation.1–3 The current understanding
of the morphogenesis of natural 3D tissue structure is
limited. Given its importance in development, repair,
tumourigenesis, and design of artiﬁcial constructs, signiﬁ-
cant resources have been directed at understanding the 3D
morphology of the microvasculature, especially the vascu-
larity of soft connective tissues,4,5 where vasculature is
often oriented along the direction of strain experienced in
vivo and/or structural features of the extracellular matrix.
Cellular orientation in engineered tissue is often achieved
by mechanical loading or contact guidance.6–9

types.7,10–12 The mechanical environment of endothelial

engineered matrices and surfaces, to biochemical and bio-
mechanical stimuli.11–18 These studies have shown that
cells align both along19,20 and transverse15,17,18,21 to the
direction of principal stretch in response to mechanical
loading. The causes of this discrepancy are elusive and
have been attributed to cell seeding density, matrix
density, genetic framework, cell age, 2D vs. 3D substrates,
cell subpopulation and the nature of loading. The angiogenic
response of intact preformed microvessels to mechanical
perturbations is relatively unexplored.
The objective of the present study was to determine the
morphological changes in sprouting microvessels in a 3D
in vitro model of angiogenesis22 because of alterations in
construct boundary conditions and external loading, in pre-
viously unaligned collagen matrices. We quantiﬁed the
orientation of microvessel segments in free-ﬂoating cul-
tures, in cultures under traction against ﬁxed anchors, and
in cultures under externally applied strain. This is the
ﬁrst study to examine the orientation of multicellular
microvessel structures rather than individual cells or cell
clusters. The results of this study demonstrate that
neovessel orientation during angiogenesis depends more on
culture boundary conditions than on externally applied
strains.
2. Methods
2.1 In vitro culture model
The 3D in vitro angiogenesis model has been characterized in our
prior publications.22,23–25 Unlike angiogenesis models that use iso-
lated endothelial cells, this model uses isolated microvessel frag-
ments. ‘Parent’ vessels contain associated perivascular cells and
retain their basement membrane after initial harvest and seeding
in 3D collagen gels. Sprouting begins predictably at Day 2–3. Peri-
cytes disassociate from parent vessels and endothelial cells,
consistent with observations that perivascular cell withdrawal
relaxes the parent endothelial cell tube and permits sprouting and
vessel elongation during angiogenesis. Sprouts elongate as patent
tubes, branching and anastamosing with other vessels, and
forming a new vascular network that ultimately ﬁlls the construct.
Neovessel constructs form a functional vascular tree when
implanted,24 rapidly inosculating with the recipient host circulation
after implantation and carrying blood.
Epididymal fat pads from male retired breeder Sprague–Dawley
rats (.500 g) were aseptically harvested conforming to the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No.
85-23, revised 1996) and washed with Leibowitz (L-15) media con-
taining 2% foetal bovine serum. Fat pads were minced into
1 mm3 pieces and subjected to limited digestion with 2 mg/mL
Clostridium collagenase (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ)
and 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) in Dulbecco’s cation-free phosphate buffered saline (DCF-PBS,
pH 7.4) at 378C for 4 min. The solution was immediately diluted
with L-15 media to halt digestion and centrifuged. The pellet was
washed twice and resuspended in L-15 media with 2% serum
and sequentially ﬁltered through a 350 mm and then a 30 mm
sterile nylon ﬁlter. The larger ﬁlter eliminates undigested
particulate debris, whereas the ﬁne ﬁlter retains larger vessel
fragments, allowing single cells and smaller fragments to pass
through. The 30 mm ﬁlter was transferred to a sterile Petri dish
and washed with serum containing L-15 media to suspend the frag-
ments. The solution was analysed for a number of microvessels and
centrifuged to obtain a pellet of microvessel fragments. Reagents
were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) unless mentioned
otherwise.
Rat tail collagen type I (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) was mixed
with concentrated Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM, Invi-
trogen, Carlsbad, CA) to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 3 mg/mL in
1  DMEM. Microvessels were suspended in collagen solution at
15000 fragments/mL, and 1.2–1.5 mL of this suspension was
pipetted into custom culture chambers and polymerized at 378C
and 95% humidity for 30 min (Figure 1). Labtek II chambers
(Nunc-Nalge, Rochester, NY) were modiﬁed to accommodate a 5 
20 mm specimen between ﬁxed and mobile anchor posts, based on

our earlier design.26 A removable Teﬂon mould was used to cast the
collagen constructs and was then removed after polymerization.
The ﬁxed post was attached to the chamber base near one end (Loc-
titew 3301, Henkel Corp., Rocky Hill, CT). Stainless steel pins were
inserted through holes in the sides of the chamber for temporary
anchorage of the mobile post. The acrylic posts had holes (1 mm
dia) to allow the collagen solution to pass through. Gels were over-
laid with serum-free culture media composed of 1:1 mixture of 1 
DMEM (low glucose) and F12 nutrient mixture with additional com-
ponents (Insulin 5 mg/mL, Transferrin 100 mg/mL, Progesterone
20 nM, Selenium 30 nM, and Putrescine 100 mM),27 rhVEGF (10 ng/
mL, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and Gentamycin (50 mg/mL).
Three chambers with and one chamber without the acrylic
anchors were prepared simultaneously and allowed to grow undis-
turbed for 3 days. The interval between preparation of microvessel
seeded collagen constructs and the beginning of mechanical inter-
vention was based on the time required for initial sprout formation
as we previously reported.22,25 On the third day, culture dimensions
were measured with digital calipers, photographed, and given a 70%
media change.
2.2 Mechanical conditioning and experimental
groups
The mechanical conditioning device used two motorized linear
actuators (Aerotech, Pittsburgh, PA, range: +25 mm, resolution:
+5 nm) for simultaneous testing of two constructs within the
incubator (Figure 1A). Chambers were mounted on raised platforms
to minimize any inﬂuence of heat, magnetic or electric ﬁelds and
vibration.
Two conditioning regimens and two boundary conditions were
evaluated (Figure 1E). For each experiment, one construct was sub-
jected to 6% ‘static stretch’ (SS group) for 3 days and the second to
6% ‘cyclic stretch’ (CS group) at 1 Hz for 12 h every 24 h for 3 days.
This cyclic routine was chosen since vasculature in tissues that are
subjected to cyclic stretch such as muscle and tendon experience
a recovery period during the sleep cycle. The free-ﬂoating con-
structs without acrylic anchors, referred to as ‘shape control’
(SC), were placed on the conditioning platform along with the SS
construct. Similarly, the anchored but unstretched construct,
referred to herein as ‘no stretch’ (NS), was placed on the cyclic con-
ditioning platform along with CS construct. To maintain comparabil-
ity across different groups, four constructs, one for each group,
were cast using the same starting material. Some samples became
contaminated because of the open culture system and hence the
ﬁnal number of samples in each group over 9 experiments were
SC—9, NS—8, SS—6, and CS—6.
2.3 Confocal microscopy
On the sixth day of culture constructs were cut free from the anchor
posts with a scalpel, gels were measured and then ﬁxed in 4%
formaldehyde. Note that the ﬁxation caused a reduction in
construct volume (20% or 7.5% along each dimension, nearly
uniform). Microvessels within the gel were permeabilized with
0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS. Endothelial cells were stained with
2 mg/mL Isolectin IB4-Alexa 488 conjugate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Confocal microscopy of six ﬁelds adjacent to the centres of
the top and bottom surfaces of the constructs was performed on
an Olympus FV1000 with a 10 objective. Individual z-axis images
were acquired to a depth of 300 mm at 2.5 mm intervals and
512  512 resolution.
2.4 Volumetric image reconstruction and
skeletonization
Image stacks from the six adjacent ﬁelds (1.27  1.27 mm each)
forming a 2  3 grid were stitched together to generate a single
mosaic (3.8  2.5  300 mm) (Figure 2). The software AmiraTM
(Mercury Computer Systems, Carlsbad, CA) was used for image
analysis and skeletonization. Intensity artefacts in images with
slice depth28 were reduced using an algorithm that ﬁt an exponen-
tial curve to average intensities. Mosaic stacks were further decon-
volved using a point spread function generated from the numerical
aperture (NA ¼ 0.4, 10X—air), wavelength of light (520 nm) and the
refractive index of the gel.29 An automated thresholding algorithm
based on a Gaussian distribution ﬁt to the image histogram was
used to binarize each mosaic stack (ImageJ, NIH). A size ﬁlter of
600 mm3 was applied to remove debris and small cell clusters.
Images were then skeletonized.30,31 A Chamfer distance map was
generated as a part of this process, and these data were used to
determine average diameter of each segment.30
2.5 Data analysis
Coordinates of points from the skeletonization, forming line equiva-
lents of the vasculature, were processed by a custom Cþþ program
(available at http://mrl.sci.utah.edu) to calculate morphometric
parameters, including branch points, end points, individual seg-
ments, and vessels (all connected segments). Total vascular
volume was determined from lengths and diameters. Additional par-
ameters were orientation with respect to stretch axis, segment and
total network length, vessel diameters, number of branches, junc-
tions, segments, segment lengths, and vascular volume fractions.
A minimum vessel size of 150 mm length was used to avoid smaller
segments and debris. This cutoff was based on microvessel dimen-
sions at the time of seeding, which were about 150 mm long. A
segment length cutoff of 25 mm was used to eliminate branches
that were not much larger than the average vessel diameters.
Segment orientation was examined along the direction of stretch
(X-axis, u) and through the culture depth (Z-axis, d). Additionally,
each segment was projected onto the XY-plane and the angle of
the projected segment with respect to the X-axis was determined
(Projected-X, f). Segments were sorted into 108 bins from 0–908.

Results were expressed as percentage of total fragments per bin and
as percentage of length-weighted segments per bin. The angle dis-
tribution of segments was compared between groups and within
groups using two-way ANOVAs and Tukey tests (or Kruskal–Wallis
ANOVA and Dunn’s post hoc tests for nonparametric distributions)
with signiﬁcance at a ¼ 0.05.
2.6 Confocal reﬂectance microscopy
Confocal reﬂection microscopy32 was performed to visualize col-
lagen ﬁbril orientation in the presence and absence of anchorage
and external loading, and modulation by growing microvessels.
Samples were illuminated with a 633 nm laser and reﬂected light
was collected between 632 and 633 nm. Several image stacks
(1 mm step size  50) were collected for each condition. To see
whether ﬁbril orientation was induced by the boundary/loading con-
ditions, gels lacking microvessels were prepared and subjected to
the same mechanical regimens. After 6 days these gels were ﬁxed
while still attached to the anchors.
3. Results
3.1 In vitro culture model
All constructs showed well-formed sprouts by Day 3 and
well-established vascular networks by Day 6 (Figure 3A).
Total volume reduction between the third and sixth day of
culture was 60% for free-ﬂoating SC constructs and 40% for
the other three groups (P ¼ 0.001, ANOVA). The SC con-
structs reduced to about 32% of their Day 3 length,
whereas the length of constructs in the other groups was
maintained by the anchoring posts. The average height
reduction in anchored construct groups was 17.6% and not
signiﬁcantly different from the SC constructs. Similarly,
there was 27.6% reduction in the width of the anchored con-
structs, which was not signiﬁcantly different from SC con-
structs. SC constructs showed a near uniform percent
contraction along the two directions.
3.2 Construct vascularity and complexity
Microvessel network morphometry at Day 6 was determined
from the 3D image reconstructions (Figure 2). Qualitatively,
the SC constructs showed random microvessel orientation,
whereas the NS, SS, and CS constructs showed various
degrees of orientation along the construct long axis. The
number of vessels per construct was highest in the SS
group and lowest in the SC group (Figure 3B). All treatment
groups had signiﬁcantly more vessels per construct than the
SC group (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA, P , 0.05). Among the three
anchored groups, the SS constructs had the highest vessel
count, followed by the CS and NS groups. However, these
differences were not signiﬁcant. The vascular volume frac-
tion (construct volume occupied by vessels) of the SS
group was 1.62 times higher than the SC group (P ¼ 0.015,
Tukey post hoc), and the NS and CS groups,were 1.39 and
1.51 times higher, respectively. SS constructs had more
branches and vessel ends than the SC group (P ¼ 0.015 and
P ¼ 0.003, respectively, Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA) (Figure 3B).
There were no differences in branches and endings
between any of the anchored (stretched or unstretched)
groups. Similarly, average branch points and end points per
vessel were not signiﬁcantly different between treatment
groups (one-way ANOVA/Ranks test). The SS group thus
showed greater network complexity than SC constructs but
was not signiﬁcantly different in terms of vascular volume

fraction, branching, and terminations from the other

3.3 Vascular orientation
Preferred orientation of microvessels was observed in the
NS, SS, and CS groups (Figure 4). In the projected X-angle
distribution, the SC constructs displayed a random orien-
tation and had a near uniform distribution of segment
lengths across all angle bins. Vessel orientation in all
anchored constructs was signiﬁcantly different from the SC
(Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA, P, 0.001) (Figure 4B). In anchored
constructs, neovessels aligned with the stretch direction,
with approximately 40% of the segments falling in the 0–
108 bin. About 70% of segments were oriented along the
X-axis (0–308) and the remaining 30% were distributed
from 40 to 908.
Orientation relative to the X-axis was similar to the pro-
jected X-angle distribution, with the SC group being signiﬁ-
cantly different from the other groups (Kruskal-Wallis
ANOVA, P ¼ 0.003) and showing nearly equitable distribution
of segment lengths across all orientations (Figure 4C).
Overall a higher percentage of segment lengths of NS, SS,
and CS groups was oriented along the stretch direction and
lower percentages were oriented orthogonal to stretch
than shape controls. Interestingly, irrespective of external
boundary conditions, most segments (about 80%) were
oriented along the horizontal or XY-plane (Figure 4D,
P ¼ 0.03, Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA). In this comparison, the
signiﬁcant difference lies between the SC and CS groups
(Dunn’s Test, P , 0.05), but the general distribution
remained the same for all groups. In all cases, the degree
of orientation orthogonal to the vertical direction was sig-
niﬁcantly greater than that expected for a random distri-
bution (post hoc Tukey, P , 0.05) and could explain
similarities between results for segment orientation along
the X-axis and projected X-axis. Results without length
weighting were similar (data not shown).
3.4 Segment length distribution
There were no signiﬁcant differences in segment length dis-
tribution between groups (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA, P ¼ 0.524)
(Figure 5A). About 80% of segments were shorter than
100 mm and about 50% were in the 25–50 mm range.
Median segment lengths ranged from 53 to 62 mm (Figure
5A-Inset). Interestingly, when median segment lengths
were analysed as a function of segment orientation, differ-
ences were observed between groups (Figure 5B, Kruskal–
Wallis ANOVA, P , 0.001). Anchored groups had longer seg-
ments along the direction of stretch or anchorage than the
SC group, but were shorter than the shape controls orthog-
onal to this axis, with a transition point around the 40–508
bin. Vessels in the SS group were signiﬁcantly shorter than
those in the NS and CS groups across all angle bins (multiple
comparisons, P , 0.001). The SC group did not show signiﬁ-
cant differences across angle bins, whereas all other groups
did show signiﬁcant differences (P , 0.001).
3.5 Segment diameter distribution
There were no signiﬁcant differences in segment diameter
distribution between groups (Figure 5C, Kruskal–Wallis
Figure 4 (A) Schematic of construct orientation convention. The long axis of the construct was aligned with direction of stretch or anchorage. (B) Projection of
the segment along the Z-axis on the XY-plane was used to calculate projected angle (f, Projected-X ). (C) Orientation along X-axis (u, horizontal direction of
stretch) and (D) Z-axis (d, vertical transverse to stretch) were directly determined based on segment orientation in these planes.

ANOVA, P ¼ 0.838). About 70% of segments were less than
10 mm in diameter and nearly 80% were smaller than
15 mm. However, when the distribution of median diameters
was examined as a function of segment orientation, there
were signiﬁcant differences between groups (Figure 5D,
two-way ANOVA, P , 0.001). The NS, SS, and CS groups
had smaller diameters along the stretch direction, and
increasingly larger diameters away from the stretch
direction, with the SS (Tukey, P ¼ 0.002) and CS (Tukey,
P , 0.001) groups being signiﬁcantly thinner than the NS
group. Thus, the microvessels were thinner along the direc-
tion of stretch and were signiﬁcantly thinner under the inﬂu-
ence of static stretch and cyclic stretch.
3.6 Diameter distribution changes
with segment length
There was a correlation between median segment diameter
and segment length for all groups (data not shown). Longer
segments had smaller diameters and vise versa. However,
there was a signiﬁcant effect of mechanical boundary
conditions on the distribution of segment diameters with
respect to segment lengths (two-way ANOVA, P, 0.001).
The SS and CS constructs had thinner segments, compared
with SC and NS groups (Tukey, P, 0.001). Neither the SS
and CS nor SC and NS groups differed signiﬁcantly from
each other irrespective of segment lengths.
3.7 Collagen ﬁbre distribution
Since boundary conditions caused neovessel orientation, we
examined the structure of the collagen matrix using confo-
cal reﬂection microscopy (Figure 6). Constructs without
microvessels were imaged as controls (Figure 6, upper
panel). In constructs without vessels, ﬁbrils were well
deﬁned and randomly oriented in the SC and NS groups. Con-
structs in the SS and NS groups appeared to have some ﬁbrils
with more orientation along the direction of strain. After
6 days in vitro, ﬁbrils in constructs containing microvessels
were less well deﬁned, likely because of matrix remodel-
ling. Although collagen ﬁbrils were less deﬁned, they
appeared to be aligned along the long axis in NS, SS, and
CS constructs. Non-anchored SC constructs did not show
this orientation.
4. Discussion
The major ﬁnding of this work is that boundary conditions
and mechanical loading can affect the morphometry of neo-
vessel networks that are formed from angiogenic microves-
sels in a 3D culture model. Anchoring produced the largest
effect in terms of neovessel orientation, whereas static
and cyclic mechanical stretch did not cause a signiﬁcant
change in orientation over anchoring alone. To our knowl-
edge this is the ﬁrst time that the effect of construct

anchoring has been demonstrated for angiogenic vessels
from preformed microvessels.
Studies of ﬁbroblast cells in 3D culture also observed
alignment of collagen ﬁbrils and ﬁbroblasts over time.6,33
Similarly, long paths of condensed matrix ﬁbres or ‘matrix
migration pathways’ were shown between endothelial cell
aggregates or other cell clusters, formed in the direction
of overlapping tractional force ﬁelds.1,34–37 Reconstituted
collagen gels usually have random orientation. Isolated
cells seeded in collagen gels orient along the direction of
maximum resistance to deformation by internal traction.38
These internal contractile forces generated in vitro by
endothelial cells and ﬁbroblasts are similar to that of
dermal ﬁbroblasts and within an order of magnitude of
smooth muscle cells.39,40 The potency of these tractional
forces and the formation of capillary-like structures
were dependent on monolayer conﬂuence, migratory or
quiescent phenotypes, MMP inhibition, substrate properties
such as concentration, thickness and rigidity, and ancho-
rage.35,39,41–43 Cells align with ﬁbrils via contact guidance
and generate traction force along the ﬁbre direction, creat-
ing a positive feedback loop, ultimately resulting in cell and
ﬁbril alignment between anchor points. Such ECM alignment
may extend to about 20 mm from cell processes.2 These
observations are supported by several other studies where
cellular traction against anchors was sufﬁcient to cause cel-
lular20 and matrix alignment1,44 and cell associated ﬁbre
bundling.45 In contrast to those studies that examined align-
ment of single bipolar cells, the present study examined the
orientation of growing microvascular segments, which are
multicellular structures.
Cell orientation in an active strain ﬁeld is generally attrib-
uted to an avoidance or shielding response, i.e. the cells
tend to orient perpendicular to the direction of
stretch.46,47 Cyclic changes in cell length with axial strain,
anisotropic strain ﬁelds, anchorage, and relative magnitude
of cell traction with respect to the substrate rather than
the absolute substrate stiffness have been shown to alter
cellular orientation and modulate capillary morphogen-
esis.43,46 In the present study, static and cyclic stretch
increased the degree of alignment along the stretch direc-
tion; however, the increase over anchoring was minimal
and not signiﬁcant. Thus, these externally applied mechan-
ical strains did not appear to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
microvessel orientation. Internal traction forces generated
by the microvessels may have been sufﬁcient to induce
alignment in the NS group.
The results of this study on multicellular angiogenic
microvessels differ from the results of other studies on iso-
lated endothelial cells and ﬁbroblasts.10,17,18,21,48,49 Endo-
thelial cells grown on 2D elastic substrates orient their
primary axis perpendicular to the direction of cyclic
strain. In one study, the multicellular cord-like structures
formed by invaginations of endothelial cells from surface
monolayers into deeper layers of the matrix oriented per-
pendicular to the direction of cyclic strain,21 hypothesized
to be an attempt to minimize the stress and injury experi-
enced by the cells because of strain at least in 2D settings
under cyclic strain. The question thus arises: why do micro-
vessels in collagen gels align along the direction of traction/
stretch as opposed to perpendicular to this direction? Poss-
ible explanations are that alignment of underlying collagen
matrix prevents reorientation by cyclic strain, the visco-
elastic nature of collagen gels fail to maintain stress on
the cells during the application of the cyclic strain, or that
the response of multicellular angiogenic constructs to mech-
anical strain and ﬁxed tractions is fundamentally different
from that of isolated cells on 2D membranes. Although cell
reorientation in response to strain has been observed in
several studies, the interaction of cells with substrate top-
ology via contact guidance can override this effect.47
However, matrix alignment does not seem to be the cause
of or at least precede cellular alignment under the inﬂuence
of cyclic stretch.20 Lower-density collagen gels (1 mg/mL)
have been shown to align under the inﬂuence of external
strain.50 The results of the present study showed that SC

more condensed making the individual collagen ﬁbrils more difﬁcult to distinguish. To eliminate bias because of collagen condensation around microvessels, the
images selected for the lower panel do not contain microvessels in those ﬁelds. Scale bar in ﬁrst image ¼ 20 mm. SC, shape control; NS, no stretch; SS, static
stretch; CS, cyclic stretch.

and NS gels had random ﬁbril orientation, whereas some
alignment parallel to stretch direction was observed under
static or cyclic strain (Figure 6, upper panel). However,
alignment is seen in the no stretch group when growing
microvessels are present (Figure 6, lower panel). Therefore,
if anchoring alone can induce the alignment of multicellular
neovessels and the collagen matrix, then an addition of
cyclic stretch may not be able to reorient cells away from
the aligned matrix. The viscoelastic nature of the collagen
constructs26 may also play a role. There may be a fall in
the actual tissue equilibrium tension because of stress relax-
ation, but the gels may still retain a strain-induced collagen
alignment.50 Alignment of endothelial cells, ﬁbroblasts,
neurites,51 and tenocytes7 on 3D matrices under static or
cyclic stretch indicate that cellular tensional homeostasis
may play a signiﬁcant role in 3D tissue architecture develop-
ment, in conjunction with contact guidance from matrix
structure.
We examined vessel volume fraction, segment length, and
segment diameter in the microvessel cultures. Although
there were no signiﬁcant differences in volume fraction of
vessels across the groups, the average volume fraction
across all construct groups (mean ¼ 0.75% of total volume)
was similar to those found in vivo.52 Diameter values were
in good agreement with previous literature.53,54 Segment
length distributions were broad, but similar to one another
with median lengths in a 53–62 mm range. These values
are slightly lower than the reported 93 mm in ﬁbrin ingrowth
models54 and 87–119 mm in rat mesenteric capillaries,55
possibly because of differences in vascular complexity and
anastomosis. These observations suggest that this in vitro
model reasonably replicates the morphometric character-
istics of angiogenic microvessels in vivo.
It should be noted that diameter measurements from the
image data can be inﬂuenced by the thresholding process
and image resolution. The ﬁnal voxel resolution of image
mosaic stacks (2.5 mm3) was a function of the 10 objec-
tive, the image resolution and Z-direction step size.
Although this combination allowed for imaging of a large
ﬁeld of view, the diameter of the vessels was dependent
on a small number of voxels. The thresholding process
could affect measured diameters; thus an automated
thresholding algorithm was used to minimize such errors.
Nevertheless, the diameters reported in this study are in
good agreement with the literature.53,54
Application of engineered grafts in medicine has demon-
strated that graft survival is often dependent on the
ability to recruit host vasculature. Vascular supply networks
to and within an implant form a signiﬁcant bottleneck in
graft integration. A prevascularized graft, engineered to
match local vascular topology, tissue architecture, and
material properties could provide a solution to this
problem. Angiogenesis in a 3D substrate from preformed
vascular elements offers a closer approximation to in vivo
physiological conditions. Our results demonstrate that chan-
ging the boundary conditions of a vascularized 3D gel con-
struct can induce substantial organization of angiogenic
neovessels. Alignment along the direction of anchorage
and strain and the associated perivascular condensed
matrix ﬁbrils recapitulate the 3D architecture of soft
tissues such as muscles and ligaments.4,5 Further research
is needed to elucidate the changes in gene and protein
expression that may be responsible for the observed
phenomena, as well as to quantify changes in collagen
ﬁbril morphometry over time.
