ABSTRACT
The 3D-partner is a web tool to predict interacting
partners and binding models of a query protein
sequence through structure complexes and a new
scoring function. 3D-partner first utilizes IMPALA
to identify homologous structures (templates) of
a query from a heterodimer profile library. The
interacting-partner sequence profiles of these tem-
plates are then used to search interacting candi-
dates of the query from protein sequence databases
(e.g. SwissProt) by PSI-BLAST. We developed a new
scoring function, which includes the contact-
residue interacting score (e.g. the steric, hydrogen
bonds, and electrostatic interactions) and the
template consensus score (e.g. couple-conserved
residue and the template similarity scores), to
evaluate how well the interfaces between the
query and interacting candidates. Based on this
scoring function, 3D-partner provides the statistic
significance, the binding models (e.g. hydrogen
bonds and conserved amino acids) and functional
annotations of interacting partners. The correlation
between experimental energies and predicted
binding affinities of our scoring function is 0.91 on
275 mutated residues from the ASEdb. The average
precision of the server is 0.72 on 563 queries and the
execution time of this server for a query is »15 s
on average. These results suggest that the
3D-partner server can be useful in protein-protein
interaction predictions and binding model visualiza-
tions. The server is available online at: http://

INTRODUCTION
Protein–protein interactions are involved in most biolog-
ical processes. Identifying their associated networks
comprehensively is the key to understanding cellular
mechanisms (1). Some systematic identiﬁcation of
protein–protein interactions have been constructed by
high-throughput experimental methods, such as large-
scale two-hybrid system (2) and aﬃnity puriﬁcations (3).
A basic problem with most large-scale experimental
methods is the high false-positive rate (4). Many
computational methods have been developed to predict
protein–protein interactions by using gene expression
proﬁles (5), domain–domain interactions (6–8), phyloge-
netic proﬁles (9), known 3D complexes (10,11) and
interologs (12,13). These large-scale methods are often
unable to respond how a protein interacts with
another one.
To identify interacting domains from three-
dimensional (3D) structural complexes is able to study
domain–domain interactions. A known 3D structure of
interacting proteins provides interacting domains and
atomic details for thousands of direct physical interac-
tions. In addition, it is usually possible to build an
interaction model of two proteins by comparative
modeling if a known complex structure comprising
homologs of these two sequences is available
(10,11,14,15). For a pair sequences, these methods
often search a 3D-complex library to ﬁnd homologous
templates and score how well the query protein pair ﬁt
the known template structures by using a scoring
matrix. In this way, they should evaluate all possible
protein pairs (18 000 000) in one species if it has 6000
proteins. Our previous study proposed ‘3D-domain
interologs’ which is similar to ‘interologs’ (12). The
3D-domain interologs is deﬁned as ‘Domain a (in chain
A) interacts with domain b (in chain B) in a known 3D
complex, their inferring protein pair A0 (containing
domain a) and B0 (containing domain b) in the same
species would be likely to interact with each other if
both protein pairs are homologous.’ Based on this
concept, we are able to search protein databases to
predict protein–protein interactions for many species
by using a 3D-dimer complex (16).

Here, we report the development of an automatic
server, 3D-partner, for interacting partners and binding
models prediction by using 3D-domain interologs through
structure complexes and a knowledge-based scoring
function which is the key novelty in this article. The
3D-partner utilizes IMPALA and PSI-BLAST to identify
homologous structures (templates) and interacting part-
ners of a query protein sequence from a 3D-dimer
template library and protein sequence databases
[i.e. SwissProt (17)], respectively. These homologous
structures and interacting partners were evaluated by
a scoring function which considered steric and special-
bond matrices (i.e. hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interac-
tions and disulﬁde bonds) but also the template consensus
scores (couple-conserved residue score and template
similarity). After interacting partners were identiﬁed, the
3D-partner provides 3D interacting domains and contact
residues for visualizing molecular details of any
protein pairs between the query and interacting partners.
The 3D-partner server was tested on 275 mutated residues
selected from the Alanine Scanning Energetics
database (ASEdb) (18) to predict the binding aﬃnities.
The correlation between experimental energies and
predicted energies is 0.91. In addition, the average
precision of this server for interacting partner prediction
is 0.72 by using a non-redundant set.
METHOD AND IMPLEMENTATION
Figure 1 presents the details of the 3D-partner server for
inferring interacting partners and binding models of a
query sequence through structure complexes and a new
scoring function by the following steps. First, the server
uses IMPALA to search template candidates of a query
(Q) from 3D-complex proﬁle library (1894 heterodimers).
IMPALA, widely used for local sequence alignments,
searches the query sequence against each of the template
proﬁles, which constitute a database of PSI-BLAST-
generated position-speciﬁc score matrices (PSSMs).
A template is considered as a candidate if the E-value is
50.05 and the aligned contact residue ratio (CR) between
the Q and candidate is 40.5. The aligned procedure
of IMPALA is a sequence (Q) to proﬁle (template)
alignment. Second, our scoring function is applied to
calculate the interacting score and Z-value for each
candidate, which is selected as a homologous template
(Ca in Figure 1) of Q if its Z-value43.0, according to the
aligned contact pairs on the template.
After homologous templates are identiﬁed, the
3D-partner identiﬁed interacting partner candidates of
the query. For each homologous template (Ca), this server
applies PSI-BLAST to scan the interacting-partner
sequence proﬁle (Cb in Figure 1) of Ca against each
of protein sequences in the SwissProt version 51.3
(containing 250 296 protein sequences). The sequence
proﬁle, built by using the same procedure for template
sequence proﬁles, is the initial PSSM of PSI-BLAST and
the number of iteration is set to one. Therefore, this search
procedure can be considered as a proﬁle-to-sequence
alignment. The sequences whose E-value50.05 and
CR40.5 are selected as homologous sequences of Cb.
Finally, for each homologous sequence, our scoring
function is applied to calculate the interacting score and
to evaluate the Z-value between the query Q and the
homologous sequence according to the aligned contact
pairs on the hit template. A homologous sequence
is considered as an interacting partner of the query if the
Z-value 43.0. The server reports interacting partners
of the query ordered by Z-values which represent the
statistical signiﬁcances of hit interacting partners.

3D-dimer library and interacting domains
The 3D-partner uses IMPALA to identify the 3D-dimer
templates of a query sequence. Here, the 3D-dimer
template library, which consists of 1894 heterodimers
(i.e. 3788 sequences), was extracted from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) (19) released in 24 February 2006.
Any sequence in the library has598% sequence identity
to each other to eliminate the duplicated complexes.
We excluded the dimer whose chains are shorter than
30 residues (15,20). For each complex in the 3D-dimer
library, we identiﬁed interacting domains and contact
residues of two chains. Contact residues, whose any heavy
atoms should be within a threshold (distance 4.5 A˚) to
any heavy atoms of another chain, were considered as the
core parts of the 3D-interacting domains in a complex.
Each domain must have4contact residues and the
number of interacting contact-residue pairs425 to make
sure that the contact between the domains was reasonably
extensive (21). After interacting domain were determined,
we identiﬁed its SCOP domain (22). Finally, each template
proﬁle in the IMPALA proﬁle library was constructed
using PSI-BLAST by searching SCOP domain sequence
against the UniRef90 database (23) in which the sequence
identity is590% of each other.
Scoring function and matrices
We have developed a scoring function to measure the
reliability of a protein–protein interaction. This scoring
function includes the contact-residue interacting score,
which consists of the steric (i.e. shape complementary) and
speciﬁc energies (e.g. hydrogen-bond energy), and the
template consensus scores which contain couple-conserved
residue and the template similarity scores. Based on this
scoring function, the 3D-partner server is able to evaluate
how well the interfaces of pairing proteins and provides
the statistic signiﬁcance (Z-value), the binding models
and functional annotations of interacting partners.
The scoring function is deﬁned as
Etot ¼ Evdw þ ESF þ wEcons 1
where Evdw is the van der Waal’s energy; ESF is the special
energy (i.e. hydrogen-bond energy, electrostatic energy
and disulﬁde-bond energy); w is constant weight; and
Econs is the template consensus score. Here, w is set to 0.8.
The Evdw and ESF are given as
Evdw ¼
XCP
i,j
Vssij þ Vsbij þ Vsbji
 
2
ESF ¼
XCP
i,j
Tssij þ Tsbij þ Tsbji
 

where CP denotes the number of the aligned-contact
residues of proteins A and B aligned to a hit template;
Vssij and Vsbij (Vsbji) are the sidechain–sidechain and
sidechain–backbone van der Waals energies between
residues i (in protein A) and j (in protein B), respectively.
Tssij and Tsbij (Tsbji) are the sidechain–sidechain and
sidechain-backbone special interacting energies between
i and j, respectively, if the pair residues i and j form the
special bonds (i.e. hydrogen bond, salt bridge or disulﬁde
bond) in the template structure. The van der Waals
energies (Vssij, Vsbij and Vsbji) and special interacting
energies (Tssij, Tsbij and Tsbji) can be obtained from
our four knowledge-based scoring matrices (Figure S1
in Supplementary Data), including sidechain–sidechain
(Figure S1-A) and sidechain–backbone van-der Waals
scoring matrices (Figure S1-B); and sidechain–sidechain
(Figure S1-C) and sidechain–backbone special-bond scor-
ing matrices (Figure S1-D). The sidechain–sidechain
scoring matrices are symmetric and sidechain–backbone-
scoring matrices are non-symmetric. The interaction
scores from these matrices provide protein–protein inter-
action binding aﬃnity estimates and preferences of
two contacted residues in the interfaces.
For the sidechain-sidechain van-der Waals scoring
matrix (Figure S1-A), the scores are high (yellow blocks)
if large-aliphatic residues (i.e. Val, Leu, Ile and Met)
interact to large-aliphatic residues or aromatic residues
(i.e. Phe, Tyr and Trp) interact to aromatic residues.
In contrast, the scores are low (orange blocks) when non-
polar residues interact to polar residues. The top two
highest scores are 3.0 (Met. to Met) and 2.9 (Trp to Trp).
For the sidechain–sidechain special-bond scoring matrix
(Figure S1-C), the score is high when the pair-interacting
residue (i.e. Cys to Cys) forms a disulﬁde bond or basic
residues (i.e. Arg, Lys and His) interact to acidic residues
(Asp and Glu). The scoring values are zero if non-polar
residues interact to other residues.
These four knowledge-based matrices are the key
components of the 3D-partner for predicting protein–
protein interactions. Here, a general mathematical struc-
ture (24) is used to construct these matrices. The entry
(Sij), which is the interacting score for a contact residue i, j
pair (1 i, j 20), of a scoring matrix is deﬁned as Sij¼ ln
qij/eij, where qij and eij are the observed probability and the
expected probability, respectively, of the occurrence of
each i, j pair. These values of qij and eij are derived from a
non-redundant set which consists of 621 3D-dimer
complexes proposed by Glaser et al. (25) This dataset
consists of 217 heterodimers and 404 homodimers and the
sequence identity is530% to each other.
The consensus score is deﬁned as
Econs ¼
PCP
i,j ðCij þ 0:5IijÞ, where Cij and Iij are the
conserved score and template similar score for a contact
residue i and j pair, respectively. They are given as
Cij ¼ max 0, Mip  Kii
 þ Mjp0  Kjj
  
4
Iij ¼ max 0, Mip  Kii þ 2
 þ Mjp0  Kjj þ 2
  
where Mip is the score in the PSSM for residue type i at
position p in Protein A; Mjp’ is the score in the PSSM for
residue type j at position p’ in Protein B; Kii and Kjj are the
diagonal scores of BLOSUM62 for residue type i and j.
Input, output and options
The 3D-partner is an easy-to-use web server. Users input
the query protein sequence in FASTA format. Users are
also able to assign a speciﬁc species for the query
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35,Web Server issue W563
sequence. The server typically returns a list of predicted
interacting partners of the query ordered by Z-values,
which represent the statistical signiﬁcance of a hit
interacting partner, within 20 s. For each predicted
interacting partner, 3D-partner provides the visualization
of the binding model between the query protein and its
partner by aligning them to respective template sequences
and structures (Figure 2). The important contact residues
in the interface are indicated in the following formats:
hydrogen-bond residues (green); conserved residues
(orange), both (yellow), and other (gray). The structure
is visualized in PNG format generated by MolScript and
Raster3D packages. If the Java software is installed in
a browser, the output will display the structures and users
are allowed to dynamically view the binding model,
interfaces, and the important residues in the browser.
Example analysis
The mitochondrial ATP synthase couples energy of the
proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane,
derived by respiration, to the phosphorylation of ADP
to ATP. The F1 catalytic domain of ATP synthase has
3 catalytic sites formed by three pairs of a/b subunits,
which are arranged as a sphere forming the core of the
enzyme. The central stalk is in the center of the core of
F1 and is physically coupled to F0 (26). If users want to

marked in template sequence based on their interacting characteristics, including hydrogen-bond residues (green); conserved residues (orange); both
(yellow), and others (gray). In this example, D6, E30 and R37 of ATPase inhibitor (PDB entry 1ohh-H) form hydrogen bonds to K382, E454 and

to query 3D-partner server. Five proteins, including
P07251 (ATP1), P38077 (ATP3), P01098 (STF1), P16140
(VMA2) and P00830 (ATP2) (Figure 2A) in yeast,
are predicted to interact with the query protein. The
interactions between the query and ATP1, ATP3 and
ATP2 are recorded in the core subset in DIP database, but
no structural data is available in PDB. ATP1 and ATP3,
which are a and g subunits of ATP synthase, respectively,
bind to the query to form F1 catalytic domain of ATP
synthase (27). ATP2 is the same protein of the query,
the aggregation of ATP2 occurred when the b-barrel
domain of ATP1 is not expressed (28).
STF1 is the ATPase-stabilizing factor which involves in
ATP synthase regulation. Currently, no study has
demonstrated that the STF1 binds ATP2 directly.
Hashimoto et al. (29) proved that STF1 binds to F1
domain of ATP synthase and inhibits ATP synthase
activity. In addition, a known structure of ATP synthase
with inhibitor protein (PDB entry 1ohh) from Bos taurus
(30) is able to be used as the template of the interacting
model between STF1 and ATP2. STF1 and 1ohh-H chain
share 33% sequence identity; and the important contact
residues (D6, E30 and R37), which forms special bonds
(i.e. hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions), are
conserved in these two proteins (Figures 2B and 2C).
These results suggest that the predicted interaction
between STF1 and ATP2 is reasonably reliable and
should be a novel interaction in yeast.
VMA2 may not interact to ATP2 based on the
subcellular locations and functions. VMA2 is non-
catalytic subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of vacuolar
ATPase and the subcellular locations of VMA2 and
ATP2 are vacuolar (GO:0016469) and mitochondria
(GO:0005739), respectively, according to the annotations
of Gene Ontology (31). In the future, our method will
integrate functional annotations (e.g. Gene Ontology)
to reduce the false-positive rate.
RESULTS
First, we evaluated our scoring function with diﬀerent
combinations on 275 mutated residues selected
from the ASEdb database (18) to predict the binding
aﬃnities (Figure 3A). In addition, a non-redundant set
(563 complexes) was used to evaluate the performance
of the 3D-partner server using various scoring methods
for interacting partner predictions (Figure 3B).
Binding affinity prediction
To determine the contribution of a residue to the binding
aﬃnity, the alanine-scanning mutagenesis is frequently
used as an experimental probe. We selected 275 mutated
residues from the ASEdb (18) with 16 heterodimers whose
3D structures were known. Those mutated residues should
position at protein–protein interfaces and be the contact
residues which were shown in the 3D-partner web server.
ASEdb gives the corresponding delta G value representing
the change in free energy of binding upon mutation
to alanine for each experimentally mutated residue.
Residues that contribute a large amount of binding
energy are often labeled as hot spots of binding energy.
Based on the interacting characteristics, these 275
mutated residues can be divided into three types, including
the special-force residues forming hydrogen bonds or
electrostatic interactions; conserved residues if the con-
served score [i.e. Cij deﬁned in Equation (4)] exceeds zero,
and the other residues. The average and standard
deviation of experimental ddG values are 1.92 and 1.97
for 99 special-force residues, respectively. For 176 non-
special-force residues, the average and standard deviation
of ddG values are 0.8 and 1.06, respectively. Standard
two-sample t-test shows that the mean of ddG values
for special-force residues is signiﬁcantly higher
(P-value5106) than that of non-special-force residues.

accuracy of 3D-partner was superior when using both knowledge-based scoring matrices and consensus scores. The performance of using one matrix
is the worst among these four scoring functions.

and standard deviation of experimental ddG values are
1.77 and 2.14, respectively, and these two values are 1.0
(average) and 1.23 (standard deviation) for 204 non-
conserved residues. The P-value of standard two-sample
t-test is 0.005 and shows that the mean of ddG values
for conserved residues is signiﬁcantly higher than that
of non-conserved residues. These results suggest that
special-force and conserved residues should be more
important than the other residues in the interacting
surface, and the scoring matrix could be divided into
van der Waal’s energy (Evdw) and special energy (ESF).
Figure 3A illustrates the correlations between ddG
values and predicted energies of the 3D-partner server
applying four diﬀerent scoring functions, including Etot
(3D-partner using both consensus and matrices), Econs
(only consensus), EvdwþESF (only matrices), and one
matrix proposed by Lu, et al. (15), on 275 mutated
residues, where Etot, Econs, Evdw and ESF are deﬁned
in Equation (1). Among these four scoring functions,
the 3D-partner server applying both consensus and
matrices is the best (0.91) and one matrix is the worst
(0.54). The correlations are 0.91 and 0.84 for using only
matrices and consensus, respectively.
Interacting partner prediction
Several metrics were utilized to assess the predicted quality
of the 3D-partner server. Precision is deﬁned as Ah/Th and
recall is deﬁned as Ah/A, where Ah is the number of true
hits in the hit list, Th is the total number of hits in the hit
list, and A is total number of true hits in the database.
The ROC curve plots the sensitivity (i.e. recall) against
the ‘1.0-speciﬁcity’ (i.e. false-positive rate). The average
precision is deﬁned as ðPAi¼1 i=T ihÞ=A, where T ih is the
number of compounds in a hit list containing i correct hits.
As the interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are the
most extensive, reliable and well studied, we measured
the quality of our predicted interactions in S. cerevisiae.
In order to evaluate performance of the 3D-partner
server using various scoring methods, we selected a
non-redundant set, called NR-563. This set consists of
563 dimer complexes from the 3D-dimer library according
to their SCOP interacting-domain pairs. At least one chain
of these complexes has diﬀerent SCOP family. Protein–
protein interactions to the tune of 5882 recorded as the
core subset in the DIP database were used as the positive
cases and 2 708 746 non-interacting protein pairs deﬁned
by Jansen et al. (5) were selected as the negative cases. The
3D-domain sequence proﬁles (i.e. 1026 sequences) of
563 complexes were used as the queries to search on the
yeast proteome (6714 sequences) selected from SGD (32)
by using PSI-BLAST. Based on this set, the 3D-partner
can yield 4206 protein–protein interaction candidates by
setting three criteria, including the sequence identity is
415%, CR exceeds 50%, and E-value is50.05. Among
these 4206 candidates, 226 (CR480% and sequence
identity 425%) and 3980 protein–protein candidates
were recoded in the positive and negative sets, respectively
(Figure S2 in Supplementary Data).
The 3D-partner server tested these four diﬀerent scoring
functions (i.e. Etot, only Econs, only EvdwþESF and one
matrix) on these 4206 candidates. The average precisions
of these four methods are 0.49 (one matrix), 0.65
(only EvdwþESF), 0.70 (only Econs) and 0.72 (Etot).
The ROC curve (Figure 3B) provides an estimation of
the likely number of true-positive and false-positive
predictions. The 3D-partner server using both scoring
matrices (EvdwþESF) and consensus scores (Econs) yields
much better predictions than one matrix (black).
The performance of using only scoring matrices and
only consensus scores are also much better than that
of one matrix.
The 3D-partner provides a threshold Z-score to identify
interacting partners with the query. The Z-score reveals
that the proportion of true positives rises when a higher
Z-score is utilized (Figure S2 in Supplementary Data).
If the sequence identity is restricted to over 25%, the
sensitivity is 0.29 and precision is 0.79 (Z-score45);
the sensitivity is 0.37 and precision is 0.70 (Z-score44);
and the sensitivity and precision are 0.41 and 0.61,
respectively (Z-score43). If the sequence identity is
restricted to over 30%, the sensitivity is 0.20 and precision
is 0.83 (Z-score45); the sensitivity is 0.25 and precision
is 0.81 (Z-score44); and the sensitivity and precision are
0.27 and 0.76, respectively (Z-score43).
Although the query and partner proteins can be
potential interactors based on reasoning that they are
homologous to interacting domains of the template, they
might be not structurally similar to the template structure.
The 3D-partner server is able to reduce the ill-eﬀect if the
sequence identity and the Z-score are restricted to over
30% and 3.5, respectively (Figure S2 in Supplementary
Data). This result is consistent with the previous results,
pairs of interacting proteins can be considered structurally

Aloy et al. (33).
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the robustness and feasibility of
the 3D-partner server to infer interacting partners and
binding models. The key novelty of the present work is the
cooperative integration of the 3D-domain interologs and
a new scoring function; the former uses interacting-
domain sequence proﬁle to search candidates for many
species eﬃciently and the latter evaluates candidates
reliably. Our scoring function achieves good agreement
for the binding aﬃnity in protein–protein interactions and
provides the statistic signiﬁcance (Z-value) for predicting
protein–protein interactions.
