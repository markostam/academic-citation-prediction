Action Potential Duration Restitution and Alternans in
Rabbit Ventricular Myocytes
The Key Role of Intracellular Calcium Cycling
Joshua I. Goldhaber, Lai-Hua Xie, Tan Duong, Christi Motter, Kien Khuu, James N. Weiss
Abstract—Action potential duration (APD) restitution properties and repolarization alternans are thought to be important
arrhythmogenic factors. We investigated the role of intracellular calcium (Ca2i) cycling in regulating APD restitution
slope and repolarization (APD) alternans in patch-clamped rabbit ventricular myocytes at 34 to 36°C, using the
perforated or ruptured patch clamp techniques with Fura-2-AM to record Ca2i. When APD restitution was measured
by either the standard extrastimulus (S1S2) method or the dynamic rapid pacing method, the maximum APD restitution
slope exceeded 1 by both methods, but was more shallow with the dynamic method. These differences were associated
with greater Ca2i accumulation during dynamic pacing. The onset of APD alternans occurred at diastolic intervals at
which the APD restitution slope was significantly 1 and was abolished by suppressing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
Ca2i cycling with thapsigargin and ryanodine, or buffering the global Ca2i transient with BAPTA-AM or BAPTA.
Thapsigargin and ryanodine flattened APD restitution slope to 1 when measured by the dynamic method, but not by
the S1S2 method. BAPTA-AM or BAPTA failed to flatten APD restitution slope to1 by either method. In conclusion,
APD alternans requires intact Ca2i cycling and is not reliably predicted by APD restitution slope when Ca2i cycling
is suppressed. Ca2i cycling may contribute to differences between APD restitution curves measured by S1S2 versus
dynamic pacing protocols by inducing short-term memory effects related to pacing-dependent Ca2i accumulation. (Circ
Res. 2005;96:459-466.)
Key Words: alternans  arrhythmia  Ca2 transients  action potential restitution
Cardiac repolarization (T wave) alternans has been shownto confer increased mortality in patients with heart
disease.1 One mechanism for generating repolarization alter-
nans is steep action potential duration (APD) restitution. As
heart rate increases, the APD shortens to preserve the diastol-
ic filling time and coronary flow. The APD restitution curve
quantifies this relationship by plotting APD against the
preceding diastolic interval (DI). During pacing and reentrant
cardiac arrhythmias, APD restitution slope has been shown to
be an important determinant of wave stability.2–11 In addition
to promoting APD alternans, a steep (1) APD restitution
slope can promote breakup of electrical waves into a
fibrillation-like state (for review, see Weiss et al12). Intracel-
lular Ca2 (Ca2i) cycling is also a dynamically active process
in cardiac muscle. Primary Ca2i alternans can drive APD to
alternate secondarily,13–15 because APD is shaped by several
key membrane currents that are sensitive to Ca2i, including
the L-type calcium current (ICa), the sodium-calcium (Na-
Ca2) exchange current and calcium-sensitive nonselective
and Cl currents. Conversely, the Ca2i transient is shaped by
the action potential, so that the action potential and Ca2i
cycling are bidirectionally coupled.
The relationship between APD alternans and APD restitu-
tion is complicated by short-term cardiac memory (to be
distinguished from long-term cardiac memory, which in-
volves changes in protein regulation and/or gene expression).
Short-term cardiac memory reflects the influence of the
pacing history in total, not just the previous DI, on APD. In
a broad sense, memory includes everything besides the last
DI that affects APD, so that its causes, by this definition, are
multifactorial. The ionic mechanisms are still only partly
understood, but both ionic currents with slow recovery
kinetics16 and Ca2i cycling have been implicated. An impor-
tant consequence of short-term memory is that the APD
restitution curve depends on the pacing protocol used to
measure it.17
The objective of this study was to analyze experimentally
the contribution of Ca2i cycling to APD alternans and APD
restitution in patch-clamped rabbit ventricular myocytes
loaded with the Ca2i indicator Fura-2. Our findings indicate

that Ca2i cycling has major influences on both APD restitution
slope and APD alternans. In addition, Ca2i cycling may also
contribute to memory-induced differences in APD restitution
curves measured by the S1S2 method versus the dynamic pacing
method. These observations support the hypothesis that Ca2i
cycling is an important determinant of dynamic wave instability
during ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Materials and Methods
Cell Isolation
We enzymatically isolated ventricular myocytes from the hearts of 2
to 3 kg rabbits as described previously.18 Briefly, hearts were
removed from rabbits anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital,
and perfused retrogradely at 37°C in Langendorff fashion with
nominally Ca2-free Tyrode’s buffer containing 1.65 mg/mL colla-
genase (Sigma Blend H C-8051; Sigma, USA) and 0.8 mg/mL
bovine albumin (Sigma A-8806) for 30 to 40 minutes. After washing
out the enzyme solution, the hearts were removed from the perfusion
apparatus, and swirled in a beaker. The calcium concentration was
slowly increased to 1.8 mmol/L, and the cells were stored at room
temperature and used within 8 hours. This procedure typically
yielded 50% rod-shaped Ca2-tolerant myocytes.
Patch Clamp Methods
Action potentials or ionic currents were measured under current- and
voltage-clamp conditions, respectively, using either the whole-cell
perforated patch or ruptured patch configurations of the patch clamp
technique.19 For perforated patch experiments, we used the ampho-
tericin method described by Rae et al20 in which the patch pipette (tip
diameter 2 to 3 m, resistance 2 to 3 M) was dipped for 10
seconds into the standard pipette solution containing (in mmol/L)
140 K-Aspartate, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 5 MgATP, 5 creatine
phosphate, and 0.05 cAMP; pH 7.2 with HCl. The pipette was then
back-filled using the same solution containing 240 g/mL
amphotericin-B (Sigma, cat. no. A4888). For ruptured patch exper-
iments, pipettes had a tip diameter of 3 to 5 m and, after gentle
fire-polishing, had to a resistance of 0.5 to 1.5 M when filled with
pipette solution above, to which 10 BAPTA was added instead of
EGTA (maintaining other ionic concentrations the same, estimated
free Ca2i 0.2 nmol/L). In some experiments, myocytes were
loaded with 100 mol/L BAPTA-AM and 0.02% pluronic (Molec-
ular Probes, Inc) for 20 to 30 minutes. Effective buffering of
intracellular Ca2 was confirmed by the absence of Ca2i transients
and contraction. Membrane current and voltage were measured with
an Axopatch 200 patch-clamp amplifier controlled by a personal
computer using a Digidata 1200 acquisition board driven by
pCLAMP 6.0/8.0 software (Axon Instruments).
The standard Tyrode bath solution contained (in mmol/L) 136 NaCl,
5.4 KCl, 0.33 Na2PO4, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 dextrose, and 10
HEPES-NaOH; pH 7.4. For some experiments, verapamil HCl
(10 mol/L), thapsigargin (200 nmol/L), and ryanodine (10 mol/L)
were added. All patch clamp experiments were performed at 34 to 36°C.
Intracellular Calcium Measurement
Myocytes were loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2 by incubat-
ing them for 20 minutes in bath solution containing 5 mol/L
fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes) and 0.016% (wt/wt) pluronic (Mo-
lecular Probes), washed, and placed in a heated chamber on an
inverted microscope modified for simultaneous patch clamping and
fura-2 epifluorescence.18 Fura-2 fluorescence emitted at 510 nm was
measured by a photomultiplier during alternate excitation (1200 Hz)
at 335 nm and at 405 nm wavelengths. We used the F335/F405 ratio as
an indirect measure of relative changes in free Ca2i.21 Because the
baseline value of the F335/F405 ratio varied from cell to cell as well as
over the course of the study (because of routine replacement of arc
lamps and filters in the optical train of the instrument), we rescaled
the F335/F405 ratio (R335/440) so that during pacing at a cycle length (CL)
of 400 ms, diastolic and peak systolic R335/440 were assigned values of
100 and 1000 arbitrary units, respectively.
APD Restitution Protocols
Three methods were used to measure APD restitution. For the
extrastimulus (S1S2) method, the myocyte was paced at a CL of 400
ms for 10 beats (sufficient to achieve steady state APD), and then an
extrastimulus (S2) was delivered at progressively shorter S1S2
coupling intervals (in 5 to 10 ms increments) until loss of capture.
For the standard dynamic (rapid pacing) method, the myocyte was
paced at a cycle length of 400 ms until steady state APD was
reached, after which the CL was progressively decreased by 5 to 20
ms either every 6 to 8 seconds or after 12 beats, until 2:1 block
occurred. In some experiments, a single beat dynamic method was
used: after 12-beat baseline pacing at 400 ms, the CL was decreased
by 5 to 20 ms after every beat until 2:1 block occurred. For all three
methods, APD was measured at 90% repolarization (APD90), and the
DI was calculated as CL minus APD90. APD restitution curves were
constructed by plotting APD90 versus DI, and the data points were
best fit to a single exponential. The maximum APD restitution slope
was calculated from the first derivative of the fitted exponential
curve. We also report the range of DIs with slope 1 obtained from
the exponential curve, because this parameter is equally important as
the maximum APD restitution slope to dynamic wave stability.10,22
Results
APD Restitution Measured by S1S2 Versus
Dynamic Protocols
Figure 1 shows representative superimposed action potentials
(A) and Ca2i transients (B) obtained during an S1S2 protocol
used to measure APD restitution. The corresponding APD
and Ca2i transient restitution curves are shown to the right,
with Ca2i expressed in arbitrary units as described in
Materials and Methods. In 5 cells, the S1S2 protocol was
repeated a second time to assess reproducibility. We excluded
myocytes in which the control value of APD shortened by
more than 10% after the first trial. Using this criterion, Figure
1C demonstrates that both the maximum APD restitution
slope (left) and the range of DIs with slope 1 (right) were
reproducible. These findings demonstrate the reproducibility
of successive APD restitution curves at near physiological
temperature, using the perforated patch configuration so as to
minimally disturb the intracellular milieu. After more than 2
protocols, however, APD failed to recover to its baseline
value. Therefore, separate myocytes were used to test the
effects of interventions on S1S2 and dynamic pacing
protocols.
Figure 2 compares APD restitution curves measured using
the S1S2 method versus the dynamic pacing method in
representative myocytes. APD restitution slope was steeper
with the S1S2 method, although both methods yielded a
maximum slope 1 over a large range of DIs. Figure 2C
shows that APD alternans developed during dynamic pacing
at a CL near 280 ms. Figure 3A summarizes the data. The
maximum APD restitution slope averaged 4.60.6 using the
standard S1S2 method and 1.20.1 using dynamic pacing
(P0.001 by unpaired t test). The ranges of DIs with slope
1 were 312 and 194 ms, respectively (P0.02 by
unpaired t test).
To investigate whether Ca2i cycling might potentially
explain the differences between the S1S2 and dynamic APD
restitution curves, we compared the levels of systolic and

diastolic Ca2i during the two protocols. Figure 3B shows that
as DIs become shorter, systolic and diastolic Ca2i rose to
relatively higher levels during dynamic pacing than during
the S1S2 protocol. Thus, for the same DI, dynamic pacing is
expected to cause greater modulation of Ca2i-sensitive ionic
currents than the S1S2 method, resulting in a pacing history–
dependent short-term memory effect attributable to Ca2i
staircase effect described previously.23
APD Restitution Slope >1 and the Onset of
APD Alternans
There was a poor correlation between the DIs at which APD
alternans developed, and the DIs at which the slope of APD
restitution became1. For example, Figure 2C shows that when
APD was plotted against the pacing CL, the onset of APD
alternans (at the split in the curve) occurred at a cycle length of
280 ms during dynamic pacing. This corresponded to a DI of
120 ms, at which the APD restitution slope (obtained by plotting
APD against DIs for the identical data; shown in Figure 2E) was
only 0.56. During dynamic pacing, APD alternans occurred in
14/14 myocytes and first developed at an average CL of 26010
ms, corresponding to an average DI of 13010 ms. The
maximum difference between the long and short APDs during
alternans averaged 515 ms. On average, the DI at which APD
alternans first developed corresponded to an APD restitution
slope of 0.400.05 during dynamic pacing. The equivalent APD
restitution slope at this DI value for S1S2 pacing averaged
0.040.02 (although S1S2 pacing protocol does not by design
elicit APD alternans). The DI at which APD restitution slope
equaled 1 was much shorter than the DI at which APD alternans
first occurred, averaging 2910 ms for dynamic pacing and
413 ms for S1S2 pacing. These findings indicate that the onset
of APD alternans under these conditions does not require a APD
restitution slope1, and suggests that the interaction with Ca2i
cycling dynamics13,24 may be critical.
SR Ca2i Cycling Regulates Both APD Restitution
Slope and Alternans
To test the importance of SR Ca2i cycling on APD restitution
and alternans, we treated myocytes with thapsigargin (200
nmol/L) and ryanodine (10 mol/L) for 10 to 15 minutes
before patching to deplete SR calcium stores. As shown in
Figure 4, thapsigarginryanodine treatment markedly sup-
pressed the Ca2i transient (Figure 4 B, inset) and prevented
APD alternans in all 7 myocytes tested (Figure 4E). In
addition, thapsigarginryanodine significantly flattened the
maximum slope of APD restitution by both the S1S2 and
dynamic pacing methods (Figure 5). With the dynamic pacing
method, however, APD restitution slope became 1 for all
DIs, consistent with the abolition of APD alternans (Figures
4D and 5). For the S1S2 method, the slope was reduced but
still remained significantly 1 over a similar range of DIs
(Figures 4B and 5).
Ca2i Cycling Is Required for APD Alternans
We also inhibited the ability of Ca2i cycling to influence
APD by buffering the Ca2i transient with the high-affinity
Ca2 buffer BAPTA-AM. Loading myocytes with
100 mol/L BAPTA-AM and 5 mol/L Fura-2-AM for 30
minutes abolished the Ca2i transient during pacing in the
perforated patch configuration. In myocytes loaded with
BAPTA-AM, no visible contractions were observed during
rapid pacing at any CL, and APD alternans was completely
abolished (n7) (Figure 6). For both protocols, APD restitu-
tion slope measured by the S1S2 method remained 1
(Figure 7A), and the range of DIs with slope 1 was
modestly prolonged.

ing protocol. A, left, Superimposed action potentials, from the

from the voltage record in A. Ca2i values are in arbitrary units
(a.u.), with 100 and 1000 representing the diastolic and systolic
levels, respectively, during steady state pacing at CL 400ms.
Because the Ca2i transient decay is slower than Vm repolariza-
tion, the peak systolic Ca2i initially sums with the tail of the
previous Ca2i transient, and therefore increases as the DI
shortens. As the DI becomes very short (175), however, Ca2i
release itself becomes compromised (because of incomplete
sarcoplasmic reticulum recovery). Thus, the peak Ca2i (tail of
previousnew release) declines. Inset, Superimposed AP and

Attempts to measure APD restitution by the standard
dynamic pacing method were complicated by progressive
APD shortening at rapid rates, even when the pacing CL was
kept fixed. The reason is unclear, but could have been
attributable to progressive activation of outward currents by
rapid pacing, or by gradual saturation of the BAPTA in the
cytoplasm by continued and persistent Ca2 influx during
rapid pacing. In support of the latter possibility, we found that
when voltage-clamped myocytes were rapidly depolarized
from 40 to 10 mV every 400 ms, inactivation of the
L-type Ca2 current increased progressively over 20 or more
beats, which would be expected to progressively shorten APD
if voltage was not clamped. This rate-dependent effect on the
Ca2-current was abolished when myocytes with pretreated
with caffeine to inhibit SR Ca2i cycling.
To circumvent this problem, we substituted the single beat
dynamic restitution method (see Materials and Methods) for
the standard dynamic method. In control myocytes without
BAPTA-AM, the single beat dynamic method yielded similar
maximum APD restitution slope and DI range with slope 1
as the standard dynamic method (Figure 7). In myocytes
loaded with BAPTA-AM (Figure 6), the maximum APD
restitution slope remained 1, despite the abolition of APD
alternans during dynamic pacing. Thus, suppressing the
global Ca2i transient with BAPTA-AM abolished APD
alternans, but did not decrease APD restitution slope to 1
using either the S1S2 or single beat dynamic pacing method.
Similar findings were obtained when myocytes were incu-
bated with 0.2 mmol/L instead of 0.1 mmol/L BAPTA-AM
for 30 minutes and also when myocytes were dialyzed with
10 mmol/L BAPTA in the patch electrode using the ruptured
whole cell patch configuration (Figure 7B).
Discussion
Repolarization alternans and steep APD restitution slope are
both considered important determinants of dynamic wave
instability, with the former used clinically to predict increased
risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.1
This study documents that Ca2i cycling plays an important
role in the cellular mechanisms underlying these phenomena.
Ionic Mechanisms Underlying APD Restitution
and Alternans
At the level of the single cell, the major factors governing
APD restitution are recovery from inactivation of inward
currents and deactivation of outward currents. Because Ca2i-
sensitive ionic currents affect repolarization, it is not surpris-
ing that Ca2i cycling affects APD restitution. APD restitution

has been analyzed extensively in intact cardiac tissue, using
pharmacological tools and ionic substitutions to assess the
relative importance of ionic current relaxation properties
versus Ca2i cycling in ventricular muscle and His-Purkinje
tissue (eg, see Saitoh et al25). A drawback of studies in intact
tissue, however, is the limited ability to analyze membrane
currents and Ca2i in detail, making it difficult to obtain
conclusive mechanistic information. Also, these studies did
not generally examine restitution properties at rapid heart
rates relevant to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular
fibrillation (VF).
In isolated myocytes, on the other hand, the contributions
of individual ionic currents and Ca2i dynamics to APD
restitution steepness can be quantitatively assessed. Previous
studies have shown that ion accumulation in extracellular
clefts or transverse-tubules did not account for APD restitu-
tion in isolated myocytes.26 Nanasi et al27 compared APD
restitution in human ventricular myocytes isolated from
diseased hearts with normal isolated guinea pig and canine
ventricular myocytes, but did not address underlying ionic
mechanisms. Hiraoka and Kawana28 studied the mechanism
of APD prolongation at short DIs after a long pause (10
seconds), whereas Janvier et al29 investigated the roles of K,
Ca2, and Na-Ca2 exchange currents at slow heart rates
(cycle length 1 second), concluding that all three types of
currents were important. Tseng30 showed that restitution of
ICa, a major determinant of APD, is strongly influenced by SR
calcium release, consistent with our findings.
Rubenstein and Lipsius31 concluded that Ca2i dynamics
played a key role in APD alternans. We have previously
demonstrated that Ca2i alternans occurred during pacing with
an action potential clamp,13 indicating that Ca2i cycling can
be a primary cause of APD alternans, as was also demon-
strated with voltage clamp protocols.32,14,15 Our present find-
ings generally agree with these previous studies and extend
their observations in several important ways, as described
later. A limitation, however, is that we did not attempt to
isolate myocytes from separate ventricular layers, so our
results represent an average of epicardial, M, and endocardial
cell properties.
Ca2i Cycling, Short-Term Cardiac Memory, and
APD Restitution
Similar to our results, Elharrar and Surawicz33 found that the
S1S2 protocol produced a steeper APD restitution slope than
dynamic pacing in canine Purkinje fibers, whereas Koller et
al17 reported the opposite in intact canine ventricular muscle
and Purkinje fibers. In the latter study, APD restitution 1
measured by dynamic pacing was also associated with APD
alternans, and increased propensity for VF. For APD restitu-
tion to be independent of the pacing protocol, APD must be
a function of the previous DI only. However, this is not
generally the case, because the pacing history also influences
APD (for theoretical analysis, see Otani and Gilmour34 and

tution slope during S1S2 pacing (A and

Tolkacheva et al35). In addition to time-dependent K cur-
rents,16 the effects of pacing on diastolic Ca2i and the state of
SR Ca2 loading can contribute to short-term memory effects
through their effects on Ca2i-sensitive currents affecting
APD. In our experiments, systolic and diastolic Ca2i rose to
different levels during dynamic and S1S2 pacing (Figure 3A).
In the dynamic protocol, sustained rapid pacing enhanced SR
Ca2 cycling (the basis for the positive staircase effect in
Ca2i and tension in rabbit ventricle23,36). The increased Ca2i
fluxes in turn affect Ca2-induced inactivation of ICa, the
Na-Ca2 exchange current, and other Ca2-sensitive cur-
rents, shifting the balance of repolarizing currents and differ-
entially affecting APD during dynamic pacing versus S1S2
pacing. Although there is no doubt that differences in Ca2i
influence APD differentially, based on our results, we cannot
determine whether these effects are quantitatively sufficient
to explain the differences in dynamic versus S1S2 APD
restitution. Other factors, such as K or other ionic currents
with intrinsically long time constants, may have been equally
important.
Ca2i Cycling and APD Alternans
It is known that Ca2i cycling can exhibit dynamics indepen-
dently of APD alternans.13–15 Our findings support a key role
of this Ca2i instability in APD alternans elicited by rapid
pacing. APD alternans consistently began at DIs at which the
APD restitution slope was1 measured by either the S1S2 or
dynamic pacing methods, which agrees with recent findings
in intact guinea pig ventricles.37 In addition, BAPTA-AM,
BAPTA, and thapsigargin and ryanodine eliminated APD
alternans, despite APD restitution slope remaining 1 by the
S1S2 method. This is not necessarily unexpected, because
the S1S2 method does not directly elicit APD alternans like
the dynamic method, and the two methods give different APD
restitution curves. Dynamic APD restitution slope 1 was
predictive of abolition of APD alternans by thapsigargin and
ryanodine. However, this was not true for BAPTA-AM and
BAPTA. APD restitution slope measured by the single beat
dynamic method remained 1 over a wide range of DIs,
despite the abolition of APD alternans. The finding of APD
restitution slope 1 without APD alternans has not been
previously described in mammalian cardiac cells to our
knowledge, although it was shown in frog ventricle38 and

In summary, neither S1S2 nor dynamic APD restitution
slopes are universally reliable predictors of APD alternans.
The most likely explanation is that Ca2i cycling dynamics are
Figure 6. Effect of buffering Ca2i with
BAPTA-AM on APD restitution and APD res-
titution slope during S1S2 pacing (A and B)
and single beat dynamic pacing (C and D), in
representative myocytes studied using the
perforated patch configuration. Solid sym-
bols show control and open symbols
BAPTA-AM loaded myocytes. APD restitu-
tion slopes in B and D were obtained from
monoexponential fits to the data points in A
and C. In separate experiments, we con-
firmed that BAPTA-AM eliminated the Ca2i
transient (see text for details). E illustrates
that APD alternans during dynamic pacing
was abolished by BAPTA-AM. Solid circles
indicate control myocytes and open sym-
bols, BAPTA-AM, using the single beat
(open circles) or standard dynamic pacing
(triangles) methods, respectively. Minimal
APD alternans occurred with the single beat,
but not the standard dynamic pacing
method, indicating that the former was tran-
sient behavior. F shows representative APs
at the shortest CL with 1:1 capture for con-
trol (top trace) and BAPTA-AM (bottom
trace) during the standard dynamic pacing
protocol.

playing a critical role in the genesis of APD alternans. This
does not necessarily mean that APD restitution slope is
unimportant, however, because theoretical studies show that
instabilities arising from Ca2i cycling and APD restitution
interact synergistically to affect the onset of APD alternans.39
The different effects of thapsigargin and ryanodine, versus
BAPTA-AM or BAPTA, on dynamic APD restitution slope,
despite both abolishing APD alternans, may be related to their
subcellular sites of action. If APD alternans is primarily
driven by SR Ca2 cycling dynamics, then either (1) suppress-
ing SR Ca cycling with thapsigargin and ryanodine, or (2)
suppressing the ability of SR Ca2 release to modulate
Ca2-sensitive currents influencing APD by buffering the
global Ca2i transient with BAPTA-AM or BAPTA would
both be expected to abolish APD alternans. However, the
effects of these interventions on APD restitution may be
different because Ca2-induced inactivation of ICa,L is known
to be more strongly influenced by SR Ca2 release in the
T-tubular/SR junction than by the global Ca2i transient.40
Computer simulations and experiments with Ca2 channel
blockers indicate that the L-type Ca2 current is a major
determinant of APD restitution slope,41,42 attributable to the
kinetics of recovery from inactivation of ICa,L. Suppressing the
global Ca2i transient with BAPTA-AM or BAPTA, without
disabling SR Ca2 cycling, would be predicted to have less
effect on Ca2-induced inactivation (and hence on recovery
from inactivation) of ICa,L, and therefore less effect on APD
restitution steepness10,22 than thapsigargin and ryanodine.
Clinical Implications
In most human and animal studies (for survey, see Weiss et
al43), the maximal APD restitution slope is near to or 1 in
at least one of the APD restitution curves published in each
study, although other investigators have argued differently.44
Both steep APD restitution slope and Ca2i cycling are
potential causes of repolarization alternans, which is a clinical
marker of increased risk of sudden cardiac death.45 Repolar-
ization alternans has also been shown to increase dynamic
wave instability, enhance wavebreak, increase inducibility of
reentry, and promote degeneration of VT to VF.10,11,17,41,42,46–49
Our study identifies the cellular mechanisms by which Ca2i
cycling has a key influence on both APD restitution steepness
and APD alternans. We find that APD alternans requires
normal Ca2i cycling and is not reliably predicted by APD
restitution slope if Ca2i cycling is suppressed. We conclude
that Ca2i cycling is a critical determinant of APD alternans
and hence dynamic wave instability. Therapies directed at
preventing VF by increasing dynamic wave stability must
take this into account.
