Abstract—Monocyte recruitment and adhesion to vascular endothelium are key early events in atherosclerosis. We
examined the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on modulating monocyte/endothelial interactions in the NOD/LtJ
(NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes. Aortas from nondiabetic and diabetic NOD mice were incubated in the absence
or presence of 100 nmol/L S1P. Fluorescently labeled monocytes were incubated with the aortas. Aortas from NOD
diabetic mice bound 7-fold more monocytes than nondiabetic littermates (101 monocytes bound/field for nondiabetic
mice vs 7412 monocytes bound/field for diabetic mice, P0.0001). Incubation of diabetic aortas with 100 nmol/L S1P
reduced monocyte adhesion to endothelium by 90%. We found expression of S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 receptors on NOD
aortic endothelial cells. The S1P1 receptor-specific agonist SEW2871 inhibited monocyte adhesion to diabetic aortas.
Studies in diabetic S1P3-deficient mice revealed that the S1P3 receptor did not play a pivotal role in this process. S1P
reduced endothelial VCAM-1 induction in type 1 diabetic NOD mice, most likely through inhibition of nuclear factor
B translocation to the nucleus. Thus, S1P activation of the S1P1 receptor functions in an antiinflammatory manner in
type 1 diabetic vascular endothelium to prevent monocyte/endothelial interactions. S1P may play an important role in
the prevention of vascular complications of type 1 diabetes. (Circ Res. 2006;99:731-739.)

Atherosclerosis development is accelerated several-fold inpatients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.1,2 Endo-
thelial activation, monocyte recruitment, and monocyte ad-
herence to activated endothelium are key early events in
atherosclerosis.3,4 We and others have identified multiple
mechanisms through which hyperglycemia in diabetes acti-
vates endothelium and increases monocyte/endothelial inter-
actions in the vessel wall.5–10
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is generated in mammalian
cells primarily from the degradation of ceramide to sphin-
gosine.11,12 Sphingosine is phosphorylated by sphingosine
kinases to generate S1P.13 S1P is secreted from leukocytes,
platelets, and endothelial cells in the vasculature. S1P is
present in nanomolar concentrations and resides on albumin
and lipoproteins, particularly high-density lipoprotein, in the
circulation.14 The functions of S1P in the vasculature include
promotion of endothelial migration, upregulation of endothe-
lial NO synthase (eNOS), inhibition of platelet aggregation,
regulation of CD4 T-lymphocyte trafficking, and regulation
of smooth muscle cell proliferation.15–20 We recently reported
that S1P reduces endothelial activation in response to tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)  challenge in mice.21 S1P binds to 5
G protein–coupled receptors, named S1P1 to S1P5.22
The nonobese diabetic (NOD/LtJ) mouse is a spontaneous
model of type 1 diabetes that develops autoimmune destruc-
tion of the pancreatic  cells, resulting in insulitis and
spontaneous hyperglycemia.23 Susceptibility to type 1 diabe-
tes in this mouse is polygenic, and by 20 weeks, approxi-
mately 60% of female NOD mice develop type 1 diabetes. In
the current study, we report that S1P prevents monocyte/en-
dothelial adhesion in NOD diabetic mice in vivo through
binding to the S1P1 receptor. Activation of this antiinflam-
matory signaling pathway results in induction of Akt/eNOS
signaling, and inhibition of nuclear factor B (NF-B).

Results
Expression of S1P Receptors in Mouse Aortic
Endothelium of Type 1 Diabetic Mice
Expression of S1P receptor mRNA in aortic ECs of NOD
mice was analyzed by RT-PCR. NOD nondiabetic and
diabetic aortic ECs express mRNA for S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3
receptors (Figure 1). There is no expression of either S1P4 or
S1P5 mRNA in mouse aortic endothelium.
S1P Blocks Monocyte/Endothelial Interactions in
Type 1 Diabetic Mouse Aorta Through S1P1
We have shown that TNF-mediated activation of endothe-
lium was blocked by S1P and by the S1P1-specific receptor
agonist 5-(4-phenyl-5-trifluoromethylthiophen-2-yl)-3-(3-
trifluoromethylphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole (SEW2871).21 In the
current study, we examined whether monocyte adhesion to
intact type 1 diabetic mouse aorta could be reduced by S1P or
SEW2871. Aortas from control and type 1 diabetic NOD
mice were incubated with fluorescently labeled monocytes.
Representative images are shown in Figure 2. The hazy
background in the images is a result of autofluorescent
structures in the aortic wall. Type 1 diabetic mouse aortas
displayed significant elevations in adhesion of monocytes to
endothelium (Figure 2A). As nondiabetic, nonactivated en-
dothelium binds very few monocytes,21,25 these data suggest
that the endothelium of type 1 diabetic NOD mice is highly
activated to bind monocytes. Incubation with 100 nmol/L S1P
ex vivo dramatically reduced monocyte adhesion to diabetic
NOD aorta (Figure 2A). To test whether specific activation of
the S1P1 receptor could prevent monocyte adhesion to aorta,
NOD control and diabetic mice were injected intravenously
with 2 mg/kg SEW2871. SEW2871 is a selective agonist for
S1P126 and is 30-fold less potent than S1P at S1P1, with no
agonist activity at S1P2 or S1P3 at concentrations up to
10 mol/L.26 Subgroups of mice were injected with saline
0.2% fatty acid–free BSA (FAFBSA) as a vehicle control.
Aortas were harvested and immediately incubated with
WEHI 78/24 mouse monocyte cells ex vivo. SEW2871
completely blocked monocyte adhesion to aorta (Figure 2B),
suggesting that activation of the endothelial S1P1 receptor
prevents monocyte/endothelial adhesion. The fact that
SEW2871 does not act on either S1P2 or S1P3 receptors at
the concentration used in our study strongly suggests that
S1P1 is the receptor causing inhibition of monocyte/endothe-
lial adhesion in the diabetic NOD mouse.
We next used VPC23019, a S1P receptor antagonist;
VPC23019 is approximately 50-fold less potent in blocking
S1P3, but is completely inactive at S1P2.27 VPC23019
(10 mol/L) inhibited the ability of S1P to reduce monocyte
adhesion to NOD diabetic aorta by 70% (Figure 2C), further
supporting a role for S1P1 and indicating that S1P2 is not
playing a major role in this process. We also used pertussis

(S1P3/) and wild-type (WT) littermates were rendered type 1 diabetic through the use of streptozotocin (STZ). Mice were either
injected with 2 mg/kg SEW2871 (SEW), and aortas were isolated for monocyte adhesion assays, or aortas were treated with 100
nmol/L S1P (S1P) ex vivo as described in Materials and Methods. Images represent monocyte adhesion to aorta in each experimental

toxin (PTX) to uncouple Gi receptor signaling.28 S1P1 is
known to couple solely through the G protein Gi.29 Sub-
groups of aortas were treated with 100 ng/mL PTX overnight
to uncouple Gi, and the aortas were treated with 1 mol/L
SEW2871 or 100 nmol/L S1P. PTX reversed the inhibitory
action of SEW2871 on monocyte adhesion to aorta by
approximately 75% (red bars in Figure 2D). PTX also
reversed the inhibitory action of S1P by approximately 70%
(data not shown). PTX alone had no effect on monocyte
adhesion to aorta (Figure 2D). The PTX experiments indicate
that S1P and SEW2871 work through a Gi-coupled receptor
to inhibit monocyte/endothelial adhesion. Thus, the notion
that S1P1 is the receptor regulating monocyte/endothelial
interactions by S1P is strengthened by the facts that (1) the
S1P1 receptor–specific agonist SEW2871 inhibits monocyte/
endothelial adhesion in aorta of type 1 diabetic NOD mice;
(2) the S1P1 receptor antagonist VPC23019 blocks the
inhibitory action of S1P; and (3) PTX inhibits the antiinflam-
matory action of both S1P and SEW2871.
Inhibition of S1P3 Does Not Interfere With the
Antiinflammatory Action of S1P on Endothelium
To formally rule out a role for S1P3, we performed studies in
diabetic S1P3-deficient mice in vivo. S1P3-deficient mice are
viable and exhibit no obvious phenotypic abnormalities.30
S1P3-deficient mice were rendered type 1 diabetic through IP
injection of streptozotocin. Fasting blood glucose values of
the diabetic S1P3-deficient mice averaged 29525 mg/dL
(control S1P3-deficient mouse blood glucose values averaged
1105 mg/dL). Two weeks after the mice developed hyper-
glycemia, aortas were isolated from the mice and used in an
ex vivo monocyte adhesion study. As expected, monocyte
adhesion was increased by almost 5-fold to diabetic S1P3-
deficient endothelium compared with nondiabetic S1P3-
deficient endothelium (Figure 3), again supporting the con-
cept that diabetes increases monocyte/endothelial interactions
in aorta. If the S1P3 receptor is required for S1P to inhibit
monocyte/endothelial interactions in type 1 diabetic mice,

then S1P should not inhibit monocyte adhesion to diabetic
S1P3-deficient endothelium. In support of this hypothesis,
S1P and SEW2871 were able to completely inhibit monocyte
adhesion to aorta in diabetic S1P3-deficient mice (Figure 3).
To rule out changes in S1P1 receptor expression in response
to the knockout of S1P3, we found no differences in S1P1
receptor mRNA levels between wild-type and S1P3-deficient
mice (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate that
the antiinflammatory effect of S1P on monocyte/endothelial
interactions appears to be dependent on S1P1 and is clearly
independent of S1P3.
S1P Reduces Monocyte Adhesion to Type 1
Diabetic Endothelium
Using a flow chamber system, we examined whether S1P
could prevent monocyte adhesion to diabetic endothelium.
Type 1 diabetic NOD endothelium showed increased adhe-
sion of monocytes in the flow chamber (Figure 4A). Treat-
ment of ECs with 100 nmol/L S1P for 4 hours blocked
monocyte adhesion (Figure 4A).
S1P Modulates Endothelial Adhesion Molecule
Expression in Diabetic NOD Mice
Surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was dramati-
cally increased on aortic endothelium of type 1 diabetic NOD
mice (Figure 4B). E-selectin expression was unchanged in
diabetic NOD endothelium and there was little expression of
P-selectin in either control or diabetic NOD endothelium
(data not shown). Incubation of diabetic ECs either with 100
nmol/L S1P or with 1 mol/L SEW2871 for 4 hours reduced
endothelial surface expression of VCAM-1 approximately
30% (Figure 4C). Surprisingly, neither S1P nor SEW2871
reduced ICAM-1 surface expression (Figure 4C). We con-
firmed decreased expression of VCAM-1 after 4 hours of
incubation of ECs with S1P using immunoblotting of total
cell lysates (Figure 4C). We also found decreased levels of
ICAM-1 after 4 hours, although surface expression changed
little, suggesting that there may be redistribution of ICAM-1
on the cell surface in response to S1P.
Blocking antibodies to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 blocked
monocyte adhesion to diabetic NOD ECs by 80% and 90%,
respectively (data not shown). Because S1P and SEW2871
reduce expression of VCAM-1 on diabetic NOD endotheli-
um, this explains, in part, the antiinflammatory effects of S1P
on monocyte/EC interactions. However, these data do not
preclude the possibility that other molecules, such as chemo-
kines or lipid mediators, influence monocyte/endothelial
interactions.
S1P Does Not Decrease Endothelial Production of
Either Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 or
IL-6 in Diabetic NOD Mice
Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 secretion was
increased by approximately 50% in diabetic NOD ECs
compared with control ECs. Values for MCP-1 were 32520
pg/mL per milligram of protein for control mice versus
48450 pg/mL per milligram of protein for NOD diabetic
mice (P0.01). Values for IL-6 tripled from 656 pg/mL per
milligram of protein for control mice to 19658 pg/mL per
milligram of protein for diabetic mice (P0.03). S1P did not
reduce endothelial secretion of either MCP-1 or IL-6 (values
averaged 49947 pg/mL per milligram of protein for MCP-1
and 21252 pg/mL per milligram of for IL-6 in diabetic
NOD EC with S1P incubation).
S1P Prevents NF-B Nuclear Translocation in
Diabetic Endothelium
When NF-B is activated, it mobilizes from the cytosol to the
nucleus, where it initiates inflammatory gene transcription.
Using an Alexa 594 fluorescent antibody that recognizes the
p65 subunit of NF-B, we found a significant increase in
nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-B in NOD
diabetic endothelial cells, indicating that these cells were
activated compared with their corresponding nondiabetic
controls (Figure 5A). Treatment of cells with either S1P or
SEW2871 significantly reduced p65 mobilization to the
nucleus (Figure 5A). There was a significant 3-fold induction
in the percentage of nuclei that were positive for nuclear p65
staining in diabetic NOD mice (Figure 5B). Both S1P and
SEW2871 reduced p65 nuclear localization in diabetic NOD
mice by 60% (Figure 5B). As NF-B becomes activated,
cytosolic IB is degraded to allow NF-B to translocate to
the nucleus to initiate inflammatory gene transcription. En-
dothelial cell extracts from diabetic NOD mice show more
p65 expression in the nucleus and less IB expression in the
cytosol compared with control NOD mice (Figure 5C). In
fact, there is little IB expression in cytosol of diabetic NOD
mice (Figure 5C). We confirmed this finding using total EC
protein lysates (Figure 5C). These data imply degradation of
IB and mobilization of NF-B to the nucleus in diabetic
NOD mice. S1P- and SEW2871-treated diabetic NOD ECs
display less nuclear p65 expression and greater IB expres-
sion in the cytosol (Figure 5C), indicating that S1P and
SEW2871 prevent NF-B activation. We performed a time
course of S1P addition to ECs and found that IB protein
expression begins to be restored in the cytosol of diabetic
NOD ECs within 30 minutes to 1 hour of S1P treatment
(Figure 5C and Figure 6). These data suggest that S1P rapidly
induces IB synthesis to inhibit NF-B activation. Interest-
ingly, we observed a slight reduction in IB expression in
control mouse ECs after 1 hour of S1P treatment (Figure 5C).
This was not observed in diabetic mouse ECs. This may be an
initial protective or survival response of control ECs to lipid
loading. However, this response appeared to be rapid and
transient and disappeared within 1 to 2 hours (Figure 5C).
Finally, to confirm that NF-B is a primary signaling path-
way for mediating monocyte adhesion to type 1 diabetic
NOD endothelium, we examined monocyte adhesion using a
flow chamber in the presence of BAY11-7085, a commonly
used pharmacological inhibitor of NF-B. As shown in
Figure I of the online data supplement, pretreatment of type 1
diabetic NOD ECs with BAY11-7085 reduced monocyte
adhesion approximately 80%, indicating that NF-B is a
primary mediator of monocyte/endothelial interactions in
diabetic NOD ECs. We also examined phosphorylation of
Ser536 of NF-B p65, which stimulates maximal transcrip-
tional activation of NF-B.31 We found significant reduction
of p65 phosphorylation after 30 minutes of S1P treatment of
Whetzel et al S1P and Monocyte Adhesion in Type 1 Diabetes 735
ECs isolated from diabetic NOD mice (Figure 6). We did not
observe decreased phosphorylation in control NOD mice.
Thus, S1P binding to the S1P1 receptor inhibits NF-B
signaling in endothelial cells via several mechanisms, thereby
reducing diabetes-mediated endothelial activation and mono-
cyte/endothelial interactions in the vessel wall.
Next, we examined Akt pathway and eNOS activation by
S1P in endothelium. Sessa and colleagues reported that S1P
activates Akt and eNOS through interactions with S1P1.19 In
diabetic NOD endothelium, both eNOS and Akt are phos-
phorylated within 10 minutes of S1P treatment of ECs
(Figure 6). Akt is also phosphorylated by S1P in nondiabetic
ECs within 10 minutes. To determine whether S1P acted via
eNOS to inhibit monocyte adhesion to endothelium, we
treated diabetic NOD ECs with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME), a well-characterized inhibitor of eNOS.
Treatment of diabetic NOD ECs with L-NAME reduced the
action of S1P by approximately 45% (supplemental Figure
II). Thus, it is quite plausible that S1P induces eNOS in
endothelium through Akt activation and that eNOS activation
contributes to the anti-inflammatory action of S1P.
To correlate S1P effects on signaling pathways with
monocyte adhesion to endothelium, we performed a time
course of S1P treatment on monocyte adhesion. Control
nondiabetic and diabetic NOD ECs were treated with S1P for
10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 4 hours, followed by a
monocyte adhesion assay using the flow chamber. The time
course of S1P incubation resulted in a step-wise decrease in
monocyte adhesion (supplemental Figure III). Thus, reduc-
tions in monocyte adhesion to endothelium can be detected as
early as 30 minutes of S1P incubation; we routinely chose 4
hours for our studies, as that time point appeared to provide
maximal reduction in adhesion (supplemental Figure III).
Fitting with these data, we observed reductions in VCAM-1
and ICAM-1 protein at 4 hours of S1P incubation, but not
before (Figure 4C). The reduction in monocyte adhesion to
endothelium that occurred within 30 minutes of incubation of
ECs with S1P was most likely attributable to chemokine or
lipid mediators and not to changes in adhesion molecule
expression (Figure 4C).
Discussion
Monocyte/endothelial interactions are key initiating events in
atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that monocyte/endothelial
interactions are significantly increased in the NOD mouse
model of type 1 diabetes. S1P in low nanomolar concentra-
tions inhibits monocyte adhesion to endothelium in type 1
diabetic NOD mice through specific activation of the endo-
thelial S1P1 receptor. Thus, S1P could provide a beneficial
therapeutic effect for diabetes-induced vascular complica-
tions through specific activation of endothelial S1P1.

Our data strongly support the concept that S1P1 is the
primary receptor mediating the “antiinflammatory” effects of
S1P. Our studies in S1P3-deficient mice (Figure 3 and
supplemental Figure IV) indicate that S1P3 does not partic-
ipate significantly to this process. Supplemental Figure IV
illustrates that there are no major differences in monocyte
adhesion between wild-type and S1P3-deficient mice in
response to physiological concentrations of S1P. Our data
obtained from the use of pharmacological agonists
(SEW2871)26,32 and antagonists of the S1P1 receptor
(VPC23019)27—both of which have no action on S1P2—
strongly suggest that S1P2 does not mediate the effects of
S1P on adhesion. Ideally, the best model for these studies is
the S1P1-deficient mouse. This mouse displays embryonic
lethality, as do endothelial-specific S1P1 KO mice, resulting
from the critical developmental role for S1P1 in vascular
maturation. If these mice were viable, we speculate that S1P
would not be able to reduce monocyte/endothelial interac-
tions in these mice and that these mice would develop
accelerated atherosclerosis, particularly in the setting of
diabetes or hyperlipidemia. Our data indicate that S1P1 is
required by S1P for reducing monocyte/endothelial interac-
tions in type 1 diabetic mice.
We suspect that signaling pathways are modulated by S1P
in monocytes as well as in endothelium. However, for the
purposes of the current study, we focused entirely on S1P
action on aortic endothelium. S1P has a striking ability to
block endothelial NF-B signaling most likely attributable to
induction of IB synthesis. The induction of IB synthesis
prevents NF-B mobilization to the nucleus to initiate inflam-
matory gene transcription. We also found decreased p65
phosphorylation in response to S1P (Figure 6). Phosphoryla-
tion of p65 is a posttranslational modification that allows for
maximal activation of NF-B.31 We confirmed that NF-B
was a primary regulator of monocyte adhesion to diabetic
NOD endothelium. Using the NF-B inhibitor BAY11-7085,
we reduced adhesion in type 1 diabetic NOD mice by
approximately 80% (supplemental Figure I). However, addi-
tion of S1P to BAY11-treated ECs showed a further reduction
in monocyte adhesion (supplemental Figure I). These data
imply that (1) there are additional mechanisms involved in
S1P action in diabetic ECs and (2) S1P is a more effective
inhibitor of NF-B than the BAY11-7085 compound. Our
data indicate that S1P blocks NF-B activation at several
steps in the pathway, including IB synthesis, NF-B
translocation, and p65 subunit phosphorylation, all of which
make S1P quite an effective NF-B inhibitor. However, there
are additional mechanisms of action of S1P in endothelium.
Sessa and colleagues have shown that S1P activates eNOS in
endothelium through Akt phosphorylation. We found rapid
phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt within 10 minutes of
treating ECs with S1P. The phosphorylation of Akt was
apparent in both control and diabetic NOD mouse ECs,
whereas the phosphorylation of eNOS seemed to be more
apparent in diabetic NOD ECs (Figure 6). Although the
phosphorylation of eNOS appears somewhat subtle, we found
that L-NAME reduces the ability of S1P to block monocyte
adhesion to diabetic NOD endothelium by approximately
45%. Thus, we concur from these data that eNOS is indeed
activated by S1P in endothelium, most likely through S1P1,19
and that eNOS activation contributes to the antiinflammatory
action of S1P on endothelium.
We found that it takes approximately 4 hours of S1P
treatment to reduce VCAM-1 expression; thus, there is not
rapid turnover of adhesion molecule expression (Figure 4C).
However, we do not know whether S1P interferes with the
physical interaction of monocyte integrins and endothelial
adhesion molecules. We anticipate that this is not the case,
because maximal effects on adhesion occur after 4 hours of
incubation with S1P and ECs are rinsed before incubation
with monocytes. Despite only a 30% reduction in VCAM-1
expression by S1P, our data suggest that the majority of S1P
inhibitory action on monocyte adhesion to endothelium after
4 hours is attributable to decreased VCAM-1 expression.
However, our results in Figure 6 and supplemental Figure III
indicate that there are additional factors contributing to the
antiinflammatory action of S1P on monocyte/endothelial
interactions at early time points (between 30 minutes and 4
hours). We have previously shown that CS-1 fibronectin
impacts monocyte/endothelial interactions.25 We did not ex-
amine CS-1 expression in the current study. Moreover, ECs
secrete multiple chemokines and lipid mediators that impact
monocyte/endothelial adhesion. These include the chemo-
kines IL-8/KC, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein
(MIP)-1, and lipid mediators produced by endothelial cy-
clooxygenase and 12/15 lipoxygenase (LO) enzymes. Indeed,
we have reported upregulation of 12/15 LO activity in
endothelium of diabetic db/db mice,5 as well as in human
aortic endothelial cells cultured in elevated glucose.6,7 We
have found that the 12/15 LO products 12(S)-hydroxyeicosa-
tetraenoic acid (12[S]-HETE) and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetra-
enoic acid (15[S]-HETE) stimulate monocyte/endothelial in-
teractions.25 Thus, inhibition of 12/15 LO product function
may be an additional mechanism of action of S1P. Studies are

underway to identify additional factors that mediate mono-
cyte/endothelial interactions that are modified by S1P.
Previous studies33,34 have reported that S1P increases
endothelial VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression. These inves-
tigators used high concentrations of S1P (5 to 20 mol/L).
We observed increased monocyte adhesion to aortic mouse
ECs at concentrations of S1P greater than 5 mol/L (supple-
mental Figure IV). In the bloodstream, physiological levels of
free S1P are in the nanomolar range,14,35 and the reported Kd
values for S1P binding to the S1P1 receptor are 1 to 10
nmol/L. Therefore, it is quite probable that high micromolar
concentrations of S1P act on receptors other than S1P1.
In summary, we have found that S1P prevents monocyte
adhesion to type 1 diabetic mouse aorta through activation of
the S1P1 receptor on endothelium. Activation of S1P1 by S1P
decreases NF-B nuclear translocation and p65 phosphory-
lation, resulting in reduced monocyte adhesion to diabetic
NOD endothelium. Therapies to upregulate the S1P1 signal-
ing pathway in type 1 diabetes may be useful for prevention
of diabetic vascular complications, including atherosclerosis.
