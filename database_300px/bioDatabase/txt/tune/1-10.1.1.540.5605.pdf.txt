ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter A1 Modulates
Apolipoprotein A-I Transcytosis Through Aortic
Endothelial Cells
Clara Cavelier, Lucia Rohrer, Arnold von Eckardstein
Abstract—High-density lipoproteins and their major protein constituent apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) possess diverse
atheroprotective properties. Most of them must be exerted within the arterial wall. Actually, high-density lipoproteins
are the most abundant lipoproteins within the arterial intima. We have recently reported that apoA-I is transcytosed
through aortic endothelial cells. In the present study, we evaluate the role of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
(ABCA1) and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) in this process. Using pharmacological interventions and RNA
interference, we investigated whether ABCA1 and SR-BI modulate apoA-I binding, internalization and transcytosis in
endothelial cells. Upregulation of ABCA1 with oxysterols increased apoA-I binding and internalization. Trapping
ABCA1 on the cell surface with cyclosporin A enhanced apoA-I binding but decreased its internalization and
transcytosis. In addition, apoA-I binding, internalization, and transcytosis were reduced by at least 50% after silencing
ABCA1 but not after knocking down SR-BI. The integrity of the endothelial cell monolayer was affected neither by
cyclosporin A treatment nor by ABCA1 silencing, as controlled by measuring inulin permeability. Finally, in
ABCA1-GFP–expressing cells, fluorescently labeled apoA-I colocalized intracellularly with ABCA1-GFP. However,
apoA-I–containing vesicles did not colocalize with the late endosome marker LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membrane
protein-1). In conclusion, ABCA1, but not SR-BI, modulates the transcytosis of apoA-I through endothelial cells. (Circ

The plasma levels of both high-density lipoproteins(HDLs) and their main apolipoprotein, apoA-I, are in-
versely correlated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
HDLs and apoA-I are exerting diverse functions that may
help to protect from atherosclerosis. They reduce oxidative
damage, correct endothelial dysfunction, inhibit inflamma-
tion, and mediate reverse cholesterol transport.1,2 At least
some of these antiatherogenic actions of HDLs and apoA-I
must be exerted within the arterial wall, rather than in the
plasma compartment. Actually, HDLs are the most abundant
lipoproteins in the extravascular space,3–6 presumably be-
cause of their small size and relative high molar plasma
concentration.7,8
Two principal mechanisms of transendothelial protein
transport have been controversially discussed: porous trans-
port and transcytosis. Porous transport refers to the passive
and convective transport of proteins across large pores
located either paracellularly or transcellularly.9,10 Transcyto-
sis designates the shuttling of proteins in plasmalemmal
vesicles across the endothelium.9,11,12 Recently, we have
reported that endothelial cells bind, internalize, and transport
apoA-I in a specific manner.13 In addition, within the first 30
minutes, approximately 50% of apoA-I that associates with
the cells is transcytosed, which indicates that apoA-I trans-
cytosis is a major process. Finally, apoA-I–specific transport
was temperature dependent, and apoA-I was modified during
transport. Thus, this phenomenological study provided the
first evidence that apoA-I is transcytosed through endothelial
cells. However, the receptor or transporter modulating apoA-I
transcytosis has not yet been identified.
ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)14 and scav-
enger receptor BI (SR-BI)15 are known apoA-I– or HDL-
binding proteins. ABCA1 belongs to the ATP-binding cas-
sette transporter family and mediates the efflux of
phospholipids and cholesterol onto apoA-I. Its activity is rate
limiting for HDL biogenesis in the liver and helps to maintain
the cholesterol homeostasis of macrophages in the vascular
wall.16,17 SR-BI belongs to the scavenger receptor family. In
the liver, it mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters
from HDLs, via a mechanism that is still unclear.15 In
addition, SR-BI contributes to the activation of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase by HDLs.18

The present study addresses the question of whether
ABCA1 and SR-BI modulate apoA-I binding, internalization,
and transport.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 5% FCS at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95%
air incubator.
Isolation and Labeling of ApoA-I
Lipid-free human apoA-I was isolated from plasma HDL and labeled
with 125I using the Iodo-Beads iodination reagent (Pierce) as de-
scribed previously.13
Pharmacological Treatments
ABCA1 expression was stimulated by a mixture of 22-R-
hydroxycholesterol (HC) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma)
10 mol/L each for 30 hours. ABCA1 was trapped on the cell
surface after incubation with 20 mol/L cyclosporin A (CsA)
(Sigma) for 4 hours.
Small Interfering RNA Transfection
BAECs were transfected when 80% to 90% confluent. BLOCK-iT
fluorescent oligo (67 nmol/L) and 100 nmol/L Stealth small inter-
fering RNA (siRNA) (Invitrogen) against either SR-BI (GTCAG-
CAAGGTCAACTATTGGCATT) or ABCA1 (GGGACTTAGT-
GGGACGAAATCTCTT) were transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 in OPTIMEM according to the protocol of the manufacturer.
Six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by DMEM 5%
FCS. Binding, internalization, and transport assays were conducted 2
to 3 days after transfection. The efficiency of the silencing was
evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting.
Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was isolated with RNeasy mini (Qiagen) according to the
protocol of the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was performed
with Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) following the standard proce-
dure. Quantitative PCR was performed with LightCycler FastStart
DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche). ABCA1 (GTCATTAT-
CATCTTCATCTGCTTCC, CCTCACATCTTCATCTTCAT-
CATTC, 60°C, 5 mmol/L MgCl2) and SR-BI (GGAATCCCCAT-
GAACTG, CTTGGGAGCTGATGTCATC, 58°C, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2) transcription levels were normalized to GAPDH (GTCT-
TCACTACCATGGAGAAGG, TCATGGATGACCTTGGCCAG,
58°C, 4 mmol/L MgCl2).
Western Blotting
BAECs were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
(10 mmol/L Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, Complete pro-
tease inhibitors from Roche). Total protein (50 g) was loaded on
the gel. The expression of ABCA1 (anti-ABCA1; ab18180, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) and SR-BI (anti-SR-BI; ab3, Abcam) was evaluated
and compared with the expression of actin (anti-actin AC-15,
Sigma).
125I-ApoA-I Binding
Cells (1105 cells/well) were seeded in a 24-well dish 2 days before
the assay. After rinsing the cells twice with DMEM, they were
incubated at 4°C for 2 hours with 5 g/mL 125I apoA-I in DMEM
HEPES 1% BSA without (total binding) or with (nonspecific
binding) a 40-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I. After incubation, the
cells were washed twice with Tris wash buffer (50 mmol/L Tris [pH
7.4], 0.15 mol/L NaCl) containing 2 mg/mL BSA and once with Tris
wash buffer without BSA. The cells were then lysed with 0.1 mol/L
NaOH, and the amount of bound 125I-apoA-I was determined and
normalized by the total protein content.
125I-ApoA-I Cell Association
125I-apoA-I cell association was determined similarly as 125I-apoA-I
binding, except that the assay was conducted at 37°C and the cells
were incubated with 125I-apoA-I for 30 minutes.
125I-ApoA-I Internalization
125I-apoA-I (0.2 mg) was biotinylated with 100 g of EZ-Link
Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 1 hour at room temperature and
purified through a Sephadex G-25 NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare).
Cells were incubated at 37°C with 5 g/mL biotin-SS/125I-apoA-I in
DMEM HEPES 1% BSA. After 30 minutes of incubation, cells were
chilled on ice for 15 minutes and washed as previously described.
The biotin moiety of the cell surface–bound biotin-SS/125I-apoA-I
was cleaved with 50 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT) in PBS,
0.1 mmol/L CaCl2, and 1 mmol/L MgCl2. The cells were lysed in
RIPA buffer. Biotin-SS/125I-apoA-I was captured with streptavidin
beads and the amount of internalized biotin-SS/125I-apoA-I deter-
mined by counting radioactivity of the beads.
125I-ApoA-I Transport
Transport assays were performed as previously described.13 In brief,
1105 cells were seeded 2 days in advance on the upper side of
porous filter inserts (0.4 m, BD Biosciences) precoated with
collagen type I (BD Biosciences). The apical medium contained 5
g/mL 125I-apoA-I, and transport from the apical to the basolateral
compartment was measured after 30 minutes.
Inulin Permeability
Inulin permeability was determined as previously described.13 In
brief, 2 mCi/mL 3H-inulin was added in the apical compartment, and
the filtrated radioactivity was collected in the basolateral compart-
ment after 30 minutes.
ABCA1-GFP Expression
The ABCA1-GFP plasmid,19 a kind gift from Jonathan D. Smith
(Department of Cell Biology, Cleveland Clinic, Ohio), was tran-
siently transfected in endothelial cells seeded on coverslips using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and following the standard protocol
of the manufacturer. ABCA1-GFP–expressing cells were character-
ized by confocal fluorescence microscopy.
Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy
Cells were incubated for 30 minutes with 5 g/mL apoA-I labeled
with alexa-546, washed 6 times 5 minutes in PBS, fixed in 3%
paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton
X-100. Late endosomes were stained with LAMP-1 (lysosome-
associated membrane protein-1) antibodies (ab19294, Abcam). Con-
focal microscopy was performed with a 63 oil-immersion lens in
the sequential mode.
Results
The aim of this study was to characterize the role of 2
well-known apoA-I– or HDL-binding proteins (ABCA1 and
SR-BI) in apoA-I transcytosis. Their involvement in apoA-I
binding, internalization, and transport was assessed.
ABCA1 and SR-BI Are Expressed in
Endothelial Cells
The expression of ABCA1 and SR-BI in BAECs was evalu-
ated by RT-PCR and Western blotting (Figure 1). Both
apoA-I candidate receptors were found to be expressed in
BAECs. Moreover, the effect of known modulators of
ABCA1 was tested in these cells. First, we verified that the
expression of ABCA1 is stimulated by a mixture of HC and
RA (Figure 1A). Second, in cells treated with CsA, a
broad-spectrum multidrug-resistance modulator, the cell sur-

face expression of ABCA1 was enhanced (Figure 1C). Third,
expression of both ABCA1 and SR-BI was diminished by
RNA interference (Figure 1B). Both candidate receptors were
knocked down with an efficiency of more than 90% on the
RNA level. The remaining protein expression of ABCA1 and
SR-BI after silencing was approximately 50%, as assessed by
Western blotting.
ABCA1, but Not SR-BI, Is Involved in ApoA-I
Binding and Cell Association
The role of ABCA1 and SR-BI in apoA-I binding (4°C) and
cell association (37°C) in BAECs was assessed after pharma-
cological treatments and siRNA-mediated silencing. First,
apoA-I binding and cell association were increased by 50%
and 35%, respectively, when the cells were stimulated with
HC and RA (Figures 2A and 3A). Second, after 4 hours of
treatment with CsA, apoA-I binding and cell association to
BAECs were also augmented by 50% and 45%, respectively
(Figures 2B and 3B), consistent with the previous finding that
CsA traps ABCA1 on the cell surface.20 These 2 results
indicated that an ABC transporter modulates apoA-I binding
and cell association to endothelial cells. Third, reducing the
expression of SR-BI by RNA interference affected neither
apoA-I–specific binding (Figure 2C) nor apoA-I–specific cell
association (Figure 3C). However, silencing ABCA1 reduced
apoA-I binding by 40% (Figure 2C) and apoA-I cell associ-
ation by 50% (Figure 3C). Therefore, we studied further only
the implication of ABCA1 in apoA-I internalization and
transcytosis in endothelial cells.
ABCA1 Plays a Role in ApoA-I internalization
The contribution of ABCA1 to apoA-I internalization was
further investigated using the treatments described above.
ApoA-I uptake in cells stimulated with HC and RA was
twice as high as in unstimulated cells (Figure 4A). In
contrast, treating the cells with the ABC transporter
inhibitor CsA reduced apoA-I internalization by 45%
(Figure 4B). In addition, after reducing ABCA1 expression
specifically by RNA interference, apoA-I uptake was
lowered by approximately 60% (Figure 4C). Furthermore,

SR-BI expression in BAECs. A, BAECs
were treated with a mixture of HC and
RA. After this treatment, ABCA1 expres-
sion was evaluated by quantitative
RT-PCR and Western blotting. B, BAECs
were transfected with siRNA specific for
ABCA1 and SR-BI. The efficiency of
ABCA1 and SR-BI knock-down was
evaluated on the RNA level and on the
protein level. C, BAECs were treated
with CsA, and ABCA1 expression on the
cell surface was measured after biotiny-
lation of the cell surface.

eral interventions. A, Expression of

siRNA.

the colocalization of apoA-I with ABCA1 in endothelial
cells was assessed after expressing an ABCA1-GFP fusion
protein. ABCA1 was observed both on the cell surface and
intracellularly. Fluorescently labeled apoA-I was found in
intracellular vesicles that seemed to colocalize with
ABCA1-GFP (Figure 5A). These results suggest that
ABCA1 modulates not only apoA-I binding and cell
association but also apoA-I internalization in BAECs. In
fibroblasts, ABCA1 colocalizes with apoA-I in late endo-
somes.21 In endothelial cells, however, apoA-I was ob-
served in vesicles that did not colocalize with the late
endosome marker LAMP-1 (Figure 5B).
ABCA1 Modulates ApoA-I Transcytosis
Finally, we characterized the implication of ABCA1 in
apoA-I transport through a monolayer of endothelial cells. In
BAECs treated with CsA, apoA-I transport was reduced by a
factor 2 as compared with untreated cells (Figure 6A). When
ABCA1 expression was decreased by RNA interference, we
observed an up to 70% reduction in apoA-I transport (Figure
6B). In addition, inulin permeability was measured to evalu-
ate the integrity of the endothelial cell monolayer after
treatment with CsA and siRNA transfection (Figure 6C and
6D). Both interventions did not affect inulin permeability,
demonstrating that the effects previously described are spe-
cific for apoA-I. Taken together, these results indicate that
apoA-I transport is modulated by ABCA1.
Discussion
We have previously reported that vascular endothelial cells
transcytose apoA-I in a specific manner. Here, we are
providing strong evidence that ABCA1 but not SR-BI is
modulating this process.
After confirming the expression of ABCA1 in endothelial
cells,22–24 we assessed the role of ABCA1 in apoA-I binding
and cell association, using pharmacological treatments and
RNA interference. Initially, we verified that, as in macro-
phages,25,26 the expression of ABCA1 is upregulated in cells
incubated with a mixture of HC and RA (Figure 1A). We also
confirmed that ABCA1 is trapped on the cell surface of cells
treated with CsA (Figure 1C), as previously reported for
macrophages.20 After either treatment, apoA-I binding (Fig-
ure 2A and 2B) and apoA-I cell association (Figure 3A and
3B) were increased. Although these treatments are not spe-
cifically modulating ABCA1, they provided evidence that an
ABC transporter is involved in apoA-I binding and cell
association to endothelial cells. Furthermore, when the ex-
pression of ABCA1 was specifically reduced by RNA inter-
ference, both apoA-I binding (Figure 2C) and apoA-I cell
association (Figure 3C) were lowered. Thus, our results and
the literature agree that ABCA1 modulates apoA-I binding.
Indeed, overexpression of ABCA1 in macrophages increases
apoA-I binding to the cell surface.27 However, it is still
controversially discussed whether ABCA1 binds directly
apoA-I or whether it modifies the lipid distribution at the

ization. ApoA-I internalization in BAECs
was measured after 30 minutes incuba-

DTT. Internalized biotin-SS/125I-apoA-I

coated beads. ApoA-I internalization was

plasma membrane facilitating apoA-I docking.28 Hence, it is
likewise unclear whether ABCA1 can be considered as a
receptor for apoA-I in endothelial cells.
We further evaluated the involvement of ABCA1 in
apoA-I internalization (Figure 4). Similarly to apoA-I binding
and cell association, apoA-I internalization was increased
after stimulating ABCA1 with HC and RA. On the contrary,
CsA inhibited apoA-I uptake. When ABCA1 expression was
reduced by RNA interference, apoA-I uptake was also dimin-
ished. Furthermore, in endothelial cells expressing the fusion
protein ABCA1-GFP, apoA-I seemed to colocalize with
ABCA1 intracellularly (Figure 5A). Thus, it seems that
ABCA1 plays a critical role in apoA-I internalization, which
is consistent with data obtained previously in macrophages
and fibroblasts.20,21 In macrophages, CsA inhibits apoA-I
uptake and resecretion by trapping ABCA1 on the cell
surface.20 In fibroblasts, apoA-I colocalizes with ABCA1
intracellularly and was found in late endosomes.21 In endo-
thelial cells, however, apoA-I–containing vesicles did not
colocalize with the late endosomal marker LAMP-1 (Figure
5B). Similar results have been previously reported for the
interaction of HDL with endothelial cells.29 Therefore, it
seems that the fate of HDL and apoA-I in endothelial cells
differs from their fate in fibroblasts (ie, lipid efflux). Inter-
estingly, although both processes require a functional
ABCA1, they do not involve the same intracellular
compartment.
It seems that ABCA1 also critically modulates apoA-I
transcytosis. Treatment with CsA and knock-down of
ABCA1 expression specifically reduced apoA-I transport
(Figure 6). ABCA1 might modulate apoA-I transcytosis, only
because of its role in apoA-I binding and internalization.
Consequently, the transporter would not regulate later events
such as apoA-I intracellular trafficking or apoA-I secretion at
the basolateral membrane. Nevertheless, a contribution of
ABCA1 to apoA-I intracellular trafficking cannot be ex-
cluded and is even suggested by the finding that ABCA1 and
apoA-I are colocalized intracellularly (Figure 5A). Moreover,
when CsA was added into only the basolateral compartment,
it inhibited apoA-I transport, although apoA-I cell association
and, hence, ABCA1 availability on the apical site remained
unchanged (data not shown). Thus, ABCA1 might modulate
not only the uptake of apoA-I but also its intracellular
trafficking and, possibly, its resecretion. Further research,
however, will have to characterize the role of ABCA1 in
these processes.
In addition, we found that SR-BI is expressed in endothe-
lial cells, as previously published by others.18,30,31 Its expres-
sion could be diminished by RNA interference (Figure 1B).
After reduction of SR-BI expression, apoA-I binding (4°C)
and cell association (37°C) to endothelial cells were not
changed (Figures 2C and 3C). On the contrary, HDL binding
was reduced (data not shown). Therefore and because SR-BI
has already been reported to bind lipidated apoA-I and HDL,
rather than lipid-free apoA-I,32,33 we did not investigate
further the implication of SR-BI in apoA-I transcytosis.
At first sight, our findings assign a novel function to
ABCA1, which is known to mediate efflux of phospholipids
and cholesterol onto apoA-I.14 However, it is important to
recall that the mechanism by which ABCA1 mediates lipid
efflux is not yet resolved.28 Most authors assume that ABCA1
acts on the cell surface and translocates phospholipids and
cholesterol from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the
plasma membrane onto apoA-I. However, lipid efflux from
macrophages onto apoA-I has also been suggested to involve
retroendocytosis, where apoA-I is internalized, interacts with
intracellular lipid pools, and is resecreted as lipidated parti-
cle.34 In human and murine macrophages that lack ABCA1,
this process is defective.35,36 Furthermore, after transcytosis
through endothelial cells, apoA-I seems to be lipidated.13

Therefore, our finding that ABCA1 modulates apoA-I inter-
nalization and transport in endothelial cells may indirectly
support the retroendocytosis hypothesis of cholesterol efflux.
According to the current opinion, ABCA1 helps protecting
against the development of atherosclerosis by 2 major mech-
anisms. It catalyzes a limiting step in HDL biogenesis in the
liver, and it mediates cholesterol efflux from macrophages.16
Many of the antiatherogenic effects of apoA-I and HDL are to
be executed within the vascular wall. Therefore, by modulat-
ing the transport of apoA-I through the endothelium into the
arterial wall, ABCA1 may exert an additional atheroprotec-
tive activity. In this context, it is important to note that several
mutations in ABCA1 were associated with cardiovascular
risk independently of HDL cholesterol.37
Porous transport and transcytosis are the 2 major mecha-
nisms controversially discussed for the transendothelial trans-
port of proteins.9,10 The identification of ABCA1 as a
rate-limiting factor in apoA-I transport through endothelial
cells supports the concept that proteins are transcytosed
through the endothelium. However, future research will have
to show the physiological and pathological relevance of the
ABCA1-mediated transendothelial transport of apoA-I.
In summary, ABCA1, but not SR-BI, modulates apoA-I
binding, internalization, and transcytosis through aortic en-
dothelial cells. This study is the first molecular characteriza-
tion of the transendothelial transport of apoA-I. More gener-
ally, the identification of ABCA1 as a modulator of apoA-I
transcytosis provides evidence that transcytosis is a relevant
mechanism for the transendothelial transport of proteins.

Figure 6. Role of ABCA1 in apoA-I transcytosis. 125I-apoA-I (5
g/mL) was added in the apical compartment of a Transwell
system, and transported apoA-I was collected in the basolateral
compartment. A, ABCA1 was inhibited on the surface of BAECs
by adding 20 mol/L CsA in the apical compartment. B, ABCA1
expression was reduced after transfecting specific siRNA. Inulin
permeability was measured to control the integrity of the cell
monolayer after CsA treatment (C) and siRNA transfection (D).
