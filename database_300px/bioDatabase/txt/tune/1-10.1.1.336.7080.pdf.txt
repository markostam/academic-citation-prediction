Abstract
The permanent activation of the transcription factor nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB) in pancreatic cancer cells is associated with
a profound resistance towards chemotherapy. In the present
study, we show that chemoresistant pancreatic cancer cell
lines exhibiting constitutive NF-nB activity (i.e., PancTu-1,
BxPc3, and Capan-1) express significantly elevated levels of
the E3-ubiquitin ligase receptor subunit BTRCP1, compared
with pancreatic carcinoma cell lines lacking constitutive NF-nB
activity and chemoresistance (i.e., PT45-P1 and T3M4). If
transfected with BTRCP1, PT45-P1 cells exhibit an elevated
NF-nB activity and become less sensitive towards anticancer
drug treatment (i.e., etoposide). Conversely, blockade of
BTRCP1 expression in PancTu-1 cells by transfection with a
vector-expressed small interferingRNAreducesNF-KnBactivation
and chemoresistance. In PancTu-1 cells, BTRCP1 expres-
sion is inhibited, at least in part, by the interleukin-1 (IL-1)
receptor(I) antagonist, whereas stimulation of PT45-P1 cells
with IL-1B resulted in an increased expression of BTRCP1,
and transfection of this cell line with BTRCP1 induced IL-1B
secretion in a NF-nB–dependent fashion. Thus, via its close
and mutual link to IL-1B secretion, BTRCP1 expression might
substantially contribute to the persistent, IL-1B–dependent
activation of NF-nB in pancreatic carcinoma cells. In support
of this, BTRCP1 expression is detectable at considerable levels
in a great number of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
specimens, along with an intense staining for activated NF-nB.
Altogether, our findings of the elevated BTRCP1 expression
in pancreatic carcinoma cells pinpoint to another important
mediator of constitutive NF-nB activation and thereby of
chemoresistance. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(4): 1316-24)
Introduction
A sustained elevation of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activity is an
abundant phenomenon of malignant tumors including leukemias
and lymphomas as well as solid tumors, such as prostate,
colorectal, and pancreatic carcinoma (1–4). As a major conse-
quence of this constitutive activation of NF-nB, tumor cells express
a great variety of NF-nB target genes conferring considerable
growth advantages, such as antiapoptotic (i.e., cIAP and Bcl-2) and
cell cycle promoting (i.e., cyclinD) genes. In addition, permanent
activation of NF-nB is associated with a profound resistance
towards chemo- and radiotherapy (5, 6). In this way, pancreatic
carcinoma represents a particularly threatening malignant disease
inasmuch as pancreatic cancer cells are notoriously resistant to all
known anticancer drugs such as gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or
etoposide (4, 7). However, from the close association of a
chemoresistant phenotype and an elevated NF-nB activity, new
concepts of chemosensitization have been proposed that rely on
specific inhibition of NF-nB activation (5, 6). These concepts
include substances such as proteasome inhibitors (i.e., MG132 and
YPD431) or InB kinase inhibitors (i.e., sulfasalazine; refs. 5–9). To
confine the suitability of NF-nB as a new molecular target in
anticancer therapy, a better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms leading to constitutive NF-nB activation is still a
major goal. Besides certain genetic alterations such as InB gene
mutations and Rel-gene amplifications (1–12), many signaling
pathways upstream of the InB kinase have been supposed to
amplify NF-nB activation, including ras/raf1 (13), mitogen-activat-
ed protein kinase (14–16), or Akt/PKB (17).
However, in pancreatic carcinoma cells other mechanisms seem
also to be involved (18). From recent studies, evidence accumu-
lated that the autocrine and juxtacrine actions of certain cytokines,
such as interleukin-1h (IL-1h), confer permanent NF-nB activation
in pancreatic carcinoma along with a profound chemoresistance
(19, 20). Furthermore, other molecular and cellular conditions are
conceivable as a prerequisite for the maintenance of high NF-nB
activation. This particularly includes molecules involved in the
second step of NF-nB activation—the degradation of InBa. As a
consequence of the signal induced InB kinase-mediated phos-
phorylation of InBa [i.e., in response to tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNFa) or IL-1h], the inhibitory protein of NF-nB becomes rapidly
polyubiquitinated and then degraded by the 26S proteasome (21).
The substrate-specific polyubiquitination of phospho-InBa repre-
sents the rate-limiting step in the signal-driven turnover of InB
and is executed by the E3-ubiquitin ligase multi-protein complex,
also known as Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein complex (22). The subs-
trate specificity of InBa polyubiquitination depends on the 67 kDa
F-box protein hTRCP1 (h-transducin repeat–containing protein)
and its closely related homologue hTRCP2/homologue of Slimb1
(hTRCP2/HOS; ref. 23). These two proteins bring phospho-InBa
into the right position for polyubiquitination via the RING E3-
ligase Rbx. Whereas HOS is particularly expressed in the
cytoplasm (24), hTRCP1 is predominantly expressed in the nucleus
(24, 25) where it is part of the recently described intranuclear
regulation of the InBa shuttling (reviewed in ref. 26). An elevated
expression of these F-box proteins may cause a permanent
derepression of NF-nB activation, as reported for pancreatic
cancer cells (7).

We herein investigated the role of hTRCP1 in the constitutive
NF-nB activation in pancreatic cancer cell lines and the
development of chemoresistance in these cells. Our findings
indicate an important contribution of hTRCP1 expression to the
NF-nB-dependent chemoresistance, and therefore allow a better
understanding of this particular phenotype.
Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Culture. The human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines
PancTu-1, BxPc3, Capan-1, T3M4, and PT45-P1 and their handling were
described previously (7, 27, 28). Cells were kept in culture (37jC, 5% CO2,
85% humidity) using RPMI-40 (PAA Laboratories, Co¨lbe, Germany)
supplemented with 1% glutamine (Life Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany)
and 10% FCS (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany).
Reagents. Etoposide was from Bristol-Myers-Squibb (Munich, Germany).
TNFa, bovine serum albumin, sulfasalazine, and Leptomycin B were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie (Steinheim, Germany). Recombinant
human IL-1h and human IL-1 receptor(I) antagonist were obtained from
R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). MG132 was from Biomol (Hamburg,
Germany) and Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) was from Biocarta
(Hamburg, Germany).
Generation of hTRCP1 siRNA and hTRCP1 Expression Vectors.
Synthetic ssDNA oligonucleotides encoding duplexed siRNA targeting to
hTRCP1 mRNA (position 441-461): 5V-tcgagtgtcattaccaacatgggcacataagcc-
catgttggtaatgacacttttt-3V/5V-ctagaaaaagtgtcattaccaacatgggcttatgtgcc-
catgttggtaatgacac-3V, or encoding a scrambled control RNA: 5V-
tcgagtgtcattaccaacatgggcacataagtgtcattaccaacatgggcttttt-3V/5V-cta-
gaaaaagcccatgttggtaatgacacttatgtgcccatgttggtaatgacac-3V, both flanked by
restriction sites for 5VSalI/3VXbaI, were annealed and then ligated into the
pSHH1 expression vector (Imgenex). The coding region of hTRCP1 mRNA
(Genbank accession no. Y14153) from PancTu-1 cells was cloned via reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; forward/reverse primers: 5V-agtggcctcggcgat-
tatggac-3V, position 54/5V-ggtcagtgtatggttatttatctgg-3V, position 1,796) into
the pCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). All
constructs were checked by automated DNA-sequencing (AbiPrism 3770).
Cell Transfection. PT45-P1 and PancTu-1 cells, seeded into six-well
plates (2.5  105 cells/well), were grown overnight, followed by mono- or
cotransfection with 5 AL/well of DIMRIE reagent (Invitrogen) and 1 Ag/well
of the following plasmids: pcDNA3.1-hTRCP1, pcDNA3.1-DNInBa (InBa
superrepressor; ref. 7), pcDNA3.1-lacZ, pSHH1-hTRCP1-siRNA, pSHH1-
control-siRNA, and pSHH1-empty. Upon transfection for 8 to 16 hours,
1 mL medium containing 20% FCS was added and cells were left untreated
for at least 8 hours before their further handling.
Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts. Hypotonic lysis of
cells and subsequent fractionation into cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts
were done as described (29, 30). The protein content of each fraction was
determined by the Dc-Protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich,
Germany), and the quality of the separation in nuclear and cytoplasmic
protein was checked by a commercial enzyme assay (Sigma-Aldrich) for
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity following the instructions of the
manufacturer. LDH activity was almost completely retained in the
cytoplasmic fraction (20-30 milliunits/Ag protein), whereas no significant
LDH contamination was found in the nuclear material (<1 milliunit/Ag
protein). For comparative Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts, stimulatory protein 1 and LDH, respectively, were used as protein
loading control.
Gel-Shift and Supershift Assay. Nuclear extracts were incubated with
the g32P-labeled oligonucleotide 5V-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3V con-
taining a consensus NF-nB binding site (Promega, Mannheim, Germany).
After incubation at room temperature (30 minutes), samples were separated
by gel electrophoresis at 100 V, 4jC. Gels were dried and exposed to X-ray
Hyperfilm (Amersham, Freiburg, Germany). For supershift assays, p65/p50
antibodies (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) were added (1 hour, 4jC)
before electrophoresis.
ELISA-Based Nuclear Factor-nB Assay. Additionally to gel-shift assays,
an ELISA-based kit was used for quantitative detection of NF-nB activity
(TransAM NF-nB kit, Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium). For each
sample, 20 AL of nuclear extracts (= 5 Ag protein) were used according to
the instructions of the manufacturer. For the detection of activated NF-nB,
antibodies against the p65/RelA or p50 subunit (Santa Cruz) were used,
followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
The colorimetric readout (450 nm) was done with an ELISA plate-reader.
Interleukin-1B ELISA. To measure human IL-1h secretion, cell culture
supernatants were precleared by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 minutes)
and submitted to the Quantikine-HS human IL-1h immunoassay (R&D
Systems) following the instructions of the manufacturer. IL-1h concen-
trations were normalized to the cell numbers determined in parallel.
Measurement of Apoptosis. Cells (2-5 105) were stained with Annexin
V/PI following the instructions of the manufacturer and analyzed by
fluorescence flow cytometry (GalaxyArgon Plus; DakoCytomation, Ham-
burg, Germany) using the FLOMAX software. Cells exhibiting high specific
Annexin V staining were regarded as apoptotic.
Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting. Mock- or hTRCP1-
transfected PT45-P1 cells (2  105) were resuspended in 500 AL of 50
mmol/LTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150mmol/LNaCl, 1mmol/L
EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (TNET buffer), 0.1 mmol/L
Na3VO4 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete-Mini/
EDTA-free, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and lysed by sonification (3  10
seconds). Then, lysates were cleared by centrifugation (microfuge, 13j000
rpm for 10 minutes, 4jC) and adjusted to equal protein concentrations using
the Dc-Protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Afterwards, lysates were
preadsorbed to protein A-agarose beads at room temperature for 1 hour
and the resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4jC with anti-
InBa-agarose conjugate (C21, Santa Cruz). The beads were recovered by
centrifugation, washed five times with TNET buffer, and prepared for
electrophoresis in 50 AL SDS sample buffer (95jC, 5 minutes). For Western
blotting, nuclear extracts or total cell lysates in SDS sample buffer (without
bromphenol blue) were prepared and protein concentrations were deter-
mined. Ten micrograms of protein were used of each sample and an
appropriate volume of SDS sample buffer containing 0.2 mg/mL bromphenol
blue and 2.5% h-mercaptoethanol was added. These samples or the
immunoprecipitated proteins were run on SDS-PAA gels (4-20% gradient)
and electroblotted as described previously (18). For the detection of hTRCP1
and hTRCP2/HOS, a polyclonal goat antibody (N15 and C20, Santa Cruz) was
used at a concentration of 1 Ag/mL in 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS (TBST)
containing 2% nonfat milk powder (2% Skim-TBST). Polyclonal antibodies
were also used for the detection of phospho-InBa (Cell Signaling, Frankfurt,
Germany) and InBa (C21, Santa Cruz) at 0.1 and 0.4 Ag/mL in 5% bovine
serum albumin-TBST, respectively, and polyubiquitinated InBawas detected
with amonoclonal polyubiquitin antibody (clone P4D1, Santa Cruz) at 0.2 Ag/
mL in 2% Skim-TBST. As control of equal protein load, an a-tubulin
monoclonal antibody or a LDH monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was
used at 0.01 Ag/mL or a stimulatory protein 1 antibody (Santa Cruz) at 0.2 Ag/
mL in 5% bovine serum albumin-TBST. All antibodies were incubated
overnight at 4jC. For the detection of these primary antibodies, anti-goat
(Santa Cruz), anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked
antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used at a dilution of 1:2,000 in 5% Skim-TBST
at room temperature for 1 hour.
Reverse Transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated and reverse
transcribed into single-stranded cDNA as described (31). PCR for the
detection of hTRCP1 was conducted as follows: 2 AL of cDNA were
submitted to thermal cycling (95jC, 2 minutes/95jC, 60 seconds; 58jC, 30
seconds; 72jC 30 seconds; for 25 cycles/72jC, 10 minutes) using 1.5 units of
Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and 0.5 Amol/L forward/reverse primers
(5V-agtggcctcggcgattatggac-3V, position 54/5V-ggtcagtgtatggttatttatctgg-3V,
position 1,796). For control, h-actin was analyzed with RT-PCR amplimer-
primers (BD Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). PCR products were separated
by 8% PAGE and visualized by ethidium bromide.
Immunohistochemistry. For hTRCP1 and NF-nB immunostaining, 26
ductal pancreatic carcinoma and five normal pancreatic tissue samples
obtained from surgical specimens were used, according to a protocol
approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospitals, Kiel
(Permission no. 110/99). Samples were snap frozen in a mixture of
bTRCP1- and kB–Dependent Chemoresistance

isopentane and dry ice and stored at 80jC. Five-micrometer cryostat
sections were cut, air dried, and fixed in acetone at room temperature for 10
minutes, then incubated with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide (DakoCytomation)
four times for 20 minutes. Intrinsic avidin and biotin were blocked with the
Avidin/Biotin-Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories/Alexis, Gru¨nberg, Ger-
many). Serum blocking and detection were done with a peroxidase-based
rabbit Vectastain Kit (Vector Laboratories). Rabbit polyclonal anti-hTRCP1
antibody (C18, Santa Cruz) was applied in 3 Ag/mL concentration for 1 hour
at room temperature. For negative control, anti hTRCP1 antibody was
coincubated with 5-fold weight excess of specific blocking peptide (Santa
Cruz) for 1 hour before immunostaining. A mouse p65/RelA antibody
(Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany), recognizing the unmasked, activated NF-
nB-subunit p65, was applied in 25 Ag/mL concentration for 1 hour at room
temperature and developed with mouse Envision Kit (DakoCytomation).
The primary antibody was omitted for negative control. After staining,
sections were counterstained in 50% haemalaun (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) and mounted with glycerol gelatin. Immunohistochemical stains
were evaluated by a semiquantitative method. hTRCP1 and NF-nB
expression in tumor cells was rated as mild (<10% of cells stained),
moderate (10-50%), or strong (>50%).
Results
Elevated hTRCP1 Expression Levels in Pancreatic Carcino-
ma Cell Lines Exhibiting Constitutive Nuclear Factor-nB
Activation. By means of Western blotting, hTRCP1 expression
was analyzed in various pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Nuclear
extracts from chemoresistant Capan-1, BxPc3, and PancTu-1 cells
(7) exhibiting high constitutive NF-nB activity (Fig. 1A) were
compared with those from chemosensitive PT45-P1 and T3M4 cells
lacking constitutive NF-nB activity (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B , a
strong signal for hTRCP1 expression, corresponding to a 67 kDa
protein, was detectable in Capan-1, BxPc3, and PancTu-1 cells. The
specificity of this band was verified by antibody incubation in the
presence of an excess of a blocking peptide (data not shown) as
well as by transfection of hTRCP1 yielding a protein of identical

exhibiting distinct basal NF-nB activities. Nuclear extracts of the human pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines Capan-1, BxPc3, PanCTu-1, PT45-P1 and T3M4
were submitted to (A) gel shift assay using a labelled specific consensus
oligonucleotide for NF-nB binding, or (B ) Western blotting for the detection
of hTRCP1 (antibody N-15, Santa Cruz). The detection of a-tubulin was
used as a control for equal protein load. Representative results from three
independent experiments are shown.

hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1 cells were either
left untreated (w/o ) or treated with 0.5 mmol/L
sulfasalazine (24 hours). Nuclear extracts from
these cells and from InBSR/lacZ cotransfectants
were analyzed by ELISA-based NF-nB binding
assay [columns, mean (n = 4); bars, SD].

cells were treated with etoposide (24 hours)
or without, either alone or after preincubation
(1 hour) with 0.5 mmol/L sulfasalazine. PT45-P1
cells cotransfected with hTRCP1/mock together
with InBSR/lacZ were treated without or with
20 Ag/mL etoposide for 24 hours. Apoptosis
was determined by Annexin V/PI staining and
subsequent flow cytometry. Data are presented

size (see below). In striking contrast, hTRCP1 expression was not
detectable at significant levels in PT45-P1 and T3M4 cells (Fig. 1B).
Effect of Increased hTRCP1 Expression on Nuclear Factor-
nB Activity and Chemoresistance in PT45-P1 Cells. PT45-P1
cells lacking significant hTRCP1 expression were transfected with
an expression vector for hTRCP1 or an empty vector (mock). As
shown by Western blot (Fig. 2A), a 67 kDa protein was detected
in nuclear extracts from hTRCP1 transfectants, similar in size to
the protein identified in the resistant cell lines described above.
To check whether hTRCP1 expression in PT45-P1 cells confers
increased NF-nB activity, gel-shift assays were done. As shown in
Fig. 2B , hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1 cells exhibited a signifi-
cantly stronger NF-nB binding activity than mock-transfected or
untransfected PT45-P1 cells. Similarly, an ELISA-based NF-nB
binding assay (TransAM, ActiveMotif), specifically detecting DNA-
bound p65/p50, revealed an increased level of activated NF-nB in
hTRCP1-transfected cells compared with mock transfectants (Fig.
2C), supporting the data revealed by gel-shift assay.
To elucidate whether overexpression of hTRCP1 influences the
sensitivity towards anticancer drugs, PT45-P1 cells were transfected
with hTRCP1 and apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/PI
staining and subsequent fluorescence flow cytometry. As shown in
Fig. 2D , mock-transfected PT45-P1 cells exhibited strong apoptosis
(up to 50% apoptotic cells) on treatment with the anticancer drug
etoposide (20 g/mL, 24 hours). In contrast, PT45-P1 cells transfected
with hTRCP1 became much less sensitive towards anticancer drug-
induced apoptosis (20-25% apoptotic cells). To verify that this
desensitization by hTRCP1 is NF-nB–dependent, PT45-P1 cells were
either cotransfected with the InBa superrepressor or were pre-
treated with the InB kinase inhibitor sulfasalazine before etoposide
incubation. As shown in Fig. 2D , the decreased sensitivity of
hTRCP1 transfectants in response to etoposide treatment (20-25%
apoptotic cells) was almost completely reversed by sulfasalazine
(>45% apoptotic cells) and strongly inhibited by the InBa super-
repressor (35-40% apoptotic cells). In parallel, significant suppres-
sion of the elevated NF-nB activity in hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1
cells by sulfasalazine or the InB superrepressor could be verified by
the ELISA-based NF-nB binding assay (Fig. 2C).
Enhanced Turnover of InBa in PT45-P1 Cells Transfected
with hTRCP1. To elucidate whether the expression of hTRCP1
affects InBa expression, transfected PT45-P1 cells were treated with
TNFa and MG132, or not. Western blot analysis of total cell extracts
from these cells (Fig. 3A) revealed significantly lower levels of InBa in
PT45-P1 cells transfected with hTRCP1 than in mock transfectants.
This effect was already seen in untreated cells and was much more
pronounced in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
alone (45 minutes) or with TNFa alone (15 minutes), or in cells
preincubated with MG132 (30 minutes) and treated with TNFa (15
minutes). The corresponding levels of phospho-InBa were similarly
reduced in hTRCP1 transfectants. Whereas in untreated cells no
significant amount of phospho-InBa could be detected, a fairly
detectable phospho-InBa band was present in MG132-treated cells,
and this bandwas significantly weaker in hTRCP1-transfected PT45-
P1 cells than in mock transfectants. The amount of phospho-InBa in
PT45-P1 cells treated with TNFa alone or with the combination of
MG132 and TNFa was also lower if hTRCP1 was overexpressed. A
similar hTRCP1-dependent pattern of the InBa turnover has been
recently found in 293T cells (22) or in murine cells (32).
Next, total cellular lysates from transfected PT45-P1 cells were
submitted to immunoprecipitation using an anti-InBa conjugate.
Again, distinct levels of phospho-InBa and InBa were detectable in
the immunoprecipitated material (Fig. 3B). In hTRCP1 trans-
fectants, the level of phospho-InBa already detectable in the
presence of MG132 alone—indicating intrinsic InBa-phosphoryla-
tion in unstimulated PT45-P1 cells—was significantly lower than in
mock transfectants. In the presence of both MG132 and TNFa,
strongly suppressed levels of phospho-InBa were observed in PT45-
P1 cells expressing hTRCP1 in comparison with mock-transfected
cells. To further elucidate the influence of hTRCP1 transfection on
InBa polyubiquitination, the immunoprecipitated protein from
Figure 3. Enhanced turnover of InBa and phospho-InBa in PT45-P1 cells
expressing hTRCP1. PT45-P1 cells were mock- or hTRCP1-transfected,
followed by incubation with TNFa (30 ng/mL, 15 minutes), with MG132
(5 Amol/L, 45 minutes), or with TNFa upon preincubation (30 minutes) with
MG132. A, total cell lysates were submitted to Western blotting using InBa,
phospho-InBa, and tubulin antibodies. B, total cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with InBa antibodies, submitted to Western blotting,
and probed with InBa or polyubiquitin antibodies; Ig-hc, immunoglobuline
heavy-chain. C, mock- or hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1 cells were
incubated with Leptomycin B (LmB ; 50 ng/mL, 16 hours) or not. Cytosolic
and nuclear extracts were submitted to Western blotting for the detection of

the purity of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts and for equal protein load.
The results shown are representative for two independent experiments.

MG132-treated cells (either alone or together with TNFa) was
probed with a polyubiquitin-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B ,
the amount of polyubiquitinated protein exhibiting high molecular
weight (>100 kDa) was rather low in mock-transfected PT45-P1
cells treated with MG132 alone, whereas under these conditions a
strong ubiquitin positive protein signal was detectable in hTRCP1
transfectants. This higher level of polyubiquitinated high molecular
weight protein was also seen in hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1 cells
subject to MG132/TNFa coincubation, producing a much stronger
polyubiquitination pattern in both transfectants.
To further investigate whether the reduced level of InBa in
hTRCP1-expressing PT45-P1 cells is the result of an enhanced
nuclear turnover, mock or hTRCP1 transfectants were treated with
Leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear exporter Crm-1, and the
distribution of InBa in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was
analyzed. The purity of these fractions was confirmed by excluding
significant LDH contamination in nuclear extracts and stimulatory
protein 1 contaminations in cytoplasmic samples (30, 33). As
shown by Western blotting (Fig. 3C), after Leptomycin B treatment
an increase in the amount of InBa in nuclear extracts from both
transfectants occurred and, in turn, a decrease in cytosolic extracts.
Of note, in hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1 cells, the amount of
nuclear InBa was significantly lower than in mock-transfected
cells, whereas this decrease in the amount of InBa was not seen in
cytosolic extracts upon Leptomycin B treatment.
Effect of Disrupted hTRCP1 Expression on Nuclear Factor-
nB Activity and Chemoresistance in PancTu-1 Cells. Next, it
was elucidated whether disruption of hTRCP1 expression in
PancTu-1 cells affects the elevated basal NF-nB activity and the
chemoresistance of this cell line. For this purpose, an expression
vector for a hTRCP1-siRNA was generated and transfected into
PancTu-1 cells. Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A) revealed that in
total cellular extracts from these cells, the amount of the 67 kDa
hTRCP1 protein was strongly reduced in comparison with
PancTu-1 cells expressing a control-siRNA or with mock-trans-
fected cells. In contrast, the smaller hTRCP-variant hTRCP2/HOS
(58 kDa) was not affected by the hTRCP1-siRNA, thus under-
scoring its target specificity. The effect of disrupted hTRCP1 on
NF-nB activity in PancTu-1 cells was further checked by gel-shift
assay. As shown in Fig. 4B , the intensity of the detectable NF-
nB-DNA complex was significantly decreased in PancTu-1 cells
transfected with hTRCP1-siRNA compared with mock-transfected
PancTu-1 cells or with cells transfected with the control-siRNA.
This decreased NF-nB binding activity in hTRCP1-siRNA-trans-
fected PancTu-1 cells was also verified by the ELISA-based NF-
nB binding assay (Fig. 4C). As an obvious consequence of the
disrupted hTRCP1 expression in PancTu-1 cells, the chemo-
resistance of this cell line was significantly decreased. As shown
in Fig. 4D , PancTu-1 cells expressing the hTRCP1-siRNA
exhibited a significantly higher rate of apoptosis in response to
etoposide treatment (30% apoptotic cells) than transfectants
Figure 4. Effect of disrupted hTRCP1 expression on
NF-nB activity and chemoresistance in PancTu-1 cells.
PancTu-1 cells were transfected either with an empty
control vector (mock), with a control-siRNA, or with the
hTRCP1-siRNA construct. A, Western blot analysis was
done with total cell lysates using hTRCP1 and hTRCP2/
HOS antibodies (N15 and C20, respectively; Santa
Cruz). The detection of tubulin was used as a control for
equal protein load. Nuclear extracts were used for the
detection of NF-nB-DNA binding activity by (B) gel-shift
assay and by (C ) the ELISA-based NF-nB assay. The
results shown are representative for two independent
experiments. D, the same transfectants were treated
with etoposide (24 hours) or not, and apoptosis was
determined by Annexin V/PI staining and subsequent
flow cytometry [columns, mean (n = 4); bars, SD].

Interrelation of IL-1h Secretion and hTRCP1 expression in
PancTu-1 and PT45-P1 Cells. Owing to the elevated NF-nB activity
in some pancreatic carcinoma cells recently shown to be related to
the autocrine action of IL-1h, we elucidated the effect of IL-1h on
hTRCP1 expression. As shown by Western blot (Fig. 5A , left) and RT-
PCR analysis (Fig. 5B , left), treatment of PancTu-1 cells with the IL-1
receptor(I) antagonist significantly reduced the expression of
hTRCP1 within 16 hours, along with a loss of NF-nB activity and
chemoprotection, as has been shown recently (19). This mode of
hTRCP1 expression was not affected by sulfasalazine (result not
shown), indicating its independence from NF-nB. In addition,
treatment of PT45-P1 cells with IL-1h (10 ng/mL) increased hTRCP1
protein levels within 16 hours (Fig. 5A , right). This increased
expression was also seen on the mRNA level, as shown by RT-PCR
analysis (Fig. 5B , right). Within 6 hours after IL-1h administration,
the hTRCP1 mRNA content was elevated in PT45-P1 cells and this
increase persisted for at least 18 hours. Under these conditions,
PT45-P1 gained an elevated NF-nB activity and significant
protection from anticancer drug-induced apoptosis, as shown
recently (7, 18). Furthermore, transfection of PT45-P1 cells with
hTRCP1 markedly elevated the release of IL-1h in comparison with
mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5C), an effect that was inhibited by
sulfasalazine treatment, confirming NF-nB dependency. In turn, the
increase of NF-nB binding activity by hTRCP1 in PT45-P1 cells could
be partially inhibited by the IL-1 receptor(I) antagonist (Fig. 5D),
thus pinpointing to the NF-nB-induced autocrine action of IL-1h, as
described previously (19). If incubated with the IL-1 receptor(I)
antagonist, the protection of PT45-P1 cells against etoposide
induced apoptosis by hTRCP1 (<25% apoptotic cells) was also
diminished (>35% apoptotic cells), as shown in Fig. 5E .
hTRCP1 Expression Is Abundantly Present in Human
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Specimens. To further
investigate whether pancreatic carcinoma is characterized by an
increasedhTRCP1 expression, tissue sections of snap frozen surgical
material from pancreatic cancer patients were analyzed by
immunohistochemistry. In 17 of 26 analyzed specimens, pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinomas exhibited significant hTRCP1 expression,
as shown by the intensive and epitope-specific immunostaining with
the hTRCP1 antibody (Fig. 6A). In 11 of these positively tested
carcinomas, hTRCP1 expression was more abundant, as indicated
by the dense immunostaining of 10% to 50% or even >50% of the
tumor cells. In six tumor specimens, the density of hTRCP1
immunostaining was lower, as indicated by the detection of <10%
positive tumor cells, and in nine tumor specimens no significant
hTRCP1 immunostaining was detectable. In comparison, all
carcinoma specimens were positively tested for activated NF-nB
(Fig. 6C), and more than 90% of these carcinomas were strongly
stained (>50% of the tumor cells) with the antibody recognizing the
unmasked, InB-freed, p65/RelA subunit of activated NF-nB. In
normal pancreatic tissue, no expression of hTRCP1 was found at all
and activated NF-nB was detected in several cases in pancreatic
acini (data not shown).

Discussion
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is characterized by an
extremely malignant phenotype and a desperately poor prognosis.
Mostly (>80%), the disease is diagnosed in an advanced stage and
the only therapeutic options then rely on palliative chemotherapy
treatments (34, 35). The major limitation in the efficacy of
chemotherapy is the innate and acquired resistance of pancreatic
carcinoma cells to apoptosis-inducing anticancer drugs. In this
context, constitutive activation of NF-nB is of particular impor-
tance for a chemoresistant phenotype, as shown for the pancreatic
ductal carcinoma cell lines PancTu-1, BxPc3, and Capan-1 (7, 18).
Our present study addressed the mechanisms of this constitutive
NF-nB activation. We were able to show that chemoresistant
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines are characterized by a significantly
elevated expression of the E3-ubiquitin ligase receptor subunit
hTRCP1 (Fig. 1). This protein is of particular importance for the
activation of NF-nB as it recruits phosphorylated InBa to the
ubiquitin conjugating E3-ligase (SCF) complex, followed by the
polyubiquitination of InBa and its rapid degradation by the 26S
proteasome (21, 22). As shown for PancTu-1 cells, down-regulation
of hTRCP1 expression by siRNA caused a significant decrease in
NF-nB activity and an increased sensitivity towards anticancer
drugs such as etoposide (Fig. 4). Conversely, in those pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines lacking high hTRCP1 expression, constitutive
NF-nB activation, and chemoresistance (i.e., PT45-P1 cells),
transfection with hTRCP1 strongly increased the NF-nB activity
and conferred a more chemoresistant phenotype (Fig. 2). Preceding
this altered phenotype, the turnover of InBa along with its
polyubiquitination was enhanced in hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1
cells (Fig. 3), indicating a reduced NF-nB repression. Consequently,
inhibition of these molecular events (i.e., by sulfasalazine or the
InBa superrepressor) abrogated the NF-nB-dependent chemo-
resistance induced by hTRCP1 (Fig. 2).
hTRCP1 is supposed to be involved in the intranuclear
derepression of NF-nB activity (24, 25) that mainly affects the
shuttling of free InBa between the cytoplasm, where it prevents NF-
nB from nuclear entry, and the nucleus where it retrieves nuclear
NF-nB back to the cytoplasm. However, evidence accumulated
indicating that even InBa-bound NF-nB enters the nucleus, either
via a nuclear localization signal of InBa or an incompletely masked
p50 subunit (26, 36, 37). However, this NF-nB/InBa complex is
unable to stay in the nucleus, due to being retrieved from there by
the nuclear export sequence of InBa (26, 38), unless intranuclear
InBa is recruited by hTRCP1 to the resident nuclear polyubiquiti-
nation complex, followed by its proteasomal degradation in the
nucleus (24, 33). Another F-box protein, designated HOS (23), is
predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm and is regarded as
mediator of cytoplasmic polyubiquitination of InBa and InBh. In
those pancreatic carcinoma cell lines investigated in the present
study, HOS (hTRCP2) expression was less different between
chemoresistant and chemosensitive cell lines than hTRCP1
expression (data not shown), suggesting that the constitutive NF-
nB activation seen in chemoresistant cells is rather due to the forced
derepression of NF-nB activity in the nucleus by hTRCP1. This is
supported by the finding that the enhanced InBa turnover was
more prominent in the nucleus of hTRCP1-transfected PT45-P1
cells subject to Leptomycin B treatment (Fig. 3C). Such an
intranuclear derepression requires a preceding signal that induces
InBa phosphorylation. We have recently shown that PancTu-1 cells
as well as several other pancreatic carcinoma cell lines sharing the
chemoresistant and NF-nB positive phenotype possess an autocrine
activation loop involving IL-1h (19, 20). It can be assumed that

IL-1h releases a discrete NF-nB activating signal that is maintained
at a higher level by hTRCP1. Intriguingly, the elevated hTRCP1
expression in PancTu-1 cells is to some extent related to the
autocrine action of IL-1h as shown by the blocking effect of the IL-1
receptor(I) antagonist (Fig. 5A and B). In further support of this
notion, exogenously added IL-1h induces hTRCP1 expression in
PT45-P1 cells (Fig. 5A and B). Obviously, by inducing hTRCP1
expression, IL-1h contributes to a persistent NF-nB activation that,
in turn, maintains IL-1h expression. Even in unstimulated PT45-P1
cells lacking prior IL-1h secretion but exhibiting significant InBa
phosphorylation (i.e., due to an amplified ras/raf1 pathway; Fig. 3A),
hTRCP1 overexpression alone is sufficient for inducing constitutive
NF-nB activation and chemoresistance. In this way, hTRCP1 is
essentially involved in a potent loop of amplified NF-nB activation,
due to a reduced NF-nB repression on the one hand (Figs. 2 and 3)
and an increased secretion of cytokines such as IL-1h on the other
hand (Fig. 5A-C). Thereby, hTRCP1 might participate in the
development of chemoresistance and, possibly, also in pancreatic
carcinogenesis.
An involvement of hTRCP in tumorigenesis has been recently
proposed for skin, gastric, and colon cancer (39–41). In addition,
deregulated hTRCP expression has been linked to other tumor
promoting pathways such as down-regulation of the disc large
tumor suppressor (hDlg; ref. 42). The implication of hTRCP1 in
tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer and development of chemo-
resistance is underscored by the finding that a great number of
tumor sections from pancreatic carcinoma patients exhibit
increased levels of hTRCP1 expression, as we showed in this study
by immunohistochemical analysis of resected tumor tissues. Being
reminiscent of the cell lines described above, significant hTRCP1
expression was detected in 65% of the tumor specimens along with
strong staining for activated NF-nB (Fig. 6). This was particularly
seen in all low differentiated G3 tumors, whereas normal pancreatic
tissue did not express hTRCP1 at all. Furthermore, chemoresistant
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines as well as pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma tissues have recently been shown to express IL-
1h quite abundantly (19, 20). Altogether, these findings provide new
insights into the molecular mechanism by which pancreatic
carcinoma cells develop chemoresistance in a NF-nB–dependent
fashion. As key elements, autocrine IL-1h secretion (i.e., induced by
stroma-tumor interactions; ref. 20) and hTRCP1-mediated dere-
pression of NF-nB confer a persistent NF-nB activation and thereby
resistance to anticancer drugs.
