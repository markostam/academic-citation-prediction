ABSTRACT
ApiDB (http://ApiDB.org) represents a unified entry
point for the NIH-funded Apicomplexan Bioinformatics
Resource Center (BRC) that integrates numerous
15 database resources and multiple data types. The
phylum Apicomplexa comprises numerous veterin-
ary and medically important parasitic protozoa
including human pathogenic species of the genera
Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma.
20 ApiDB serves not only as a database in its own right,
but as a single web-based point of entry that unifies
access to three major existing individual organism
databases (PlasmoDB.org, ToxoDB.org and
CryptoDB.org), and integrates these databases with
25 data available from additional sources. Through the
ApiDB site, users may pose queries and search all
available apicomplexan data and tools, or they may
visit individual component organism databases.
INTRODUCTION
30 The phylum Apicomplexa comprises numerous veterinary
and medically important parasitic protozoa including human
pathogenic species of the genera Cryptosporidium, Plasmod-
ium and Toxoplasma. Multiple species of Plasmodium are
capable of causing malaria in humans, a leading cause of
35 morbidity and mortality in developing countries (1).
Cryptosporidium causes a severe and chronic diarrheal dis-
ease that may be life threatening in immunocompromised
patients (2). Toxoplasma gondii infections, although typically
asymptomatic in healthy individuals, may lead to congenital
40 birth defects and encephalitis in HIV/AIDS patients (3).
Human infections with T.gondii may be acquired from food
or soil contamination and infections with Cryptosporidium
parvum from soil and water contamination. Due to the
potential threat to public health from intentional dispersal
45into the population, T.gondii and C.parvum are listed as
Category B Biodefense Pathogens by the National Institutes
of Health.
The research communities for Cryptosporidium, Plasmod-
ium and Toxoplasma have benefited from the bioinformatics
50resources provided by the distinct online genome databases
CryptoDB (4), PlasmoDB (5) and ToxoDB (6), respectively
(See supplementary material). Because of the phylogenetic
relationship of these human pathogens, (all are included in
the phylum Apicomplexa, along with the prominent animal
55pathogens, Babesia, Theileria and Eimeria) comparative
genomic and proteomic studies across these species is critical
for expediting discovery of therapeutic targets, increasing
understanding of parasite biology and enhancing other areas
of research on the biology of these organisms. However,
60the researcher’s ability to perform comparative studies
utilizing multiple data sources has been tempered by the
difficulty of managing and collating the data from the exist-
ing disparate resource databases. Here we describe the online
apicomplexan Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC),
65ApiDB (http://ApiDB.org), which has been established to
provide researchers centralized, integrated access to experi-
mental and computational data, as well as tools to facilitate
comparative research.
ApiDB integrates the existing CryptoDB, ToxoDB and
70PlasmoDB component resources. Database integration is
accomplished via a combination of federation and link inte-
gration technologies (7). Link integration allows researchers
to begin their query with one data source and then follow
hypertext links to related information in other data sources.
75Database federation is achieved by decomposing distributed
queries into component queries and executing these queries
in the source databases, delivering the results into a uniform
format. It leaves the information in its source databases but
builds an environment around the databases that makes

80 them all seem part of one large system. In ApiDB 2.0 the
federation has been implemented using Oracle DbLink
technology. In order to handle heterogeneous data sources
in the future we are studying other federation approaches,
such as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) (http://java.sun.
85 com/javase/technologies/database.jsp) and Web Services
(WS) (http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/).
ApiDB serves as a web portal for cross-species compari-
son. Genome data from other apicomplexan parasites are
also integrated. In its current release, ApiDB 2.0 offers an
90 initial set of queries that enable gene searches of the three
component databases by a variety of criteria such as text
keywords, Enzyme Commission (EC) number Gene Ontology
(8) assignments, and Pfam (9) terms. In addition, ApiDB
offers tools to BLAST (10) all public apicomplexan data,
95 access to the multi-species gene orthology database
OrthoMCL DB (11) and access to KEGG (12) metabolic
pathway maps with ‘painted’ comparative highlights of
apicomplexan and human enzymes.
FUNCTIONALITY OF CURRENT RELEASE
100 ApiDB 2.0 was released in April 2006. The datasets available
in ApiDB include the component databases (CryptoDB,
PlasmoDB and ToxoDB), apicomplexan genomic sequences
for other species (Theileria annulata and Theileria parva)
obtained from the NCBI Genbank (13) and GeneDB (14),
105 a collection of clustered apicomplexan ESTs including:
Eimeria, Gregarina, Neospora, Sarcocystis and Theileria
called ApiDoTS [a newer version of ApiEST-DB (15)] and
unclustered ESTs from the NCBI Genbank division, dbEST.
The ApiDB web interface shares its architecture and ‘look
110 and feel’ with the component sites (CryptoDB, PlasmoDB
and ToxoDB). The user can interact with four areas on the
main page: the sidebar, a tools section, a query section and
a menu bar (Figure 1A). The sidebar gives the user access
to apicomplexan community resources, from our project’s
115 most recent news to PubCrawler (16) and external resources,
as well as information on the annual ApiDB training
workshop (See supplementary material). The tools section
provides access to a BLAST search of Apicomplexa genomic,
EST and gene model sequences (Figure 1D) and to
120 OrthoMCL DB and KEGG maps with apicomplexan and
human enzymes highlighted. The query section provides
queries for gene and protein features that span CryptoDB,
PlasmoDB and ToxoDB and may include searches of all or
a subset of the component species genomes (Figure 1B).
125 Finally, the menu bar appears on every page and gives access
to the user’s query history and the information on the datasets
used in the database.
ApiDB’s query architecture provides a set of pages where
users can easily execute and manage queries. On the front
130 page, six federated queries are currently available that span
the component databases: search genes by gene ID, by
annotated keyword in product description (Figure 1B), by
Pfam domain, by EC number, by GO term, and by BLAST
similarity. Upon query selection, the user is presented with
135 a question page where they can refine their search
(Figure 1B). When the query is executed, a summary page
offers the number of hits for each organism and the list of
genes that meet the requirements (Figure 1C). Hyperlinks
connect the user to the gene page in the component sites.
140Gene pages, acquired from the appropriate component data-
base provide a detailed view of annotation and analysis for
the given gene record in the database. For a detailed descrip-
tion of the gene record page we refer to the component data-
bases (4–6).
145The query history page, linked in the menu bar, permits
users to track their searches and combine them into more
complex queries across data types, e.g. find all genes in
Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma that have a
signal peptide and no transmembrane domains. Summaries
150of the number of hits for each organism are provided when
queries are executed (Figure 1C). As in the component
sites, the web interface includes a mechanism to allow
users to readily download the sequences and other attributes
associated with their query result set (e.g. gene name, product
155description, coordinates, length) in a versatile tab-delimited
file (Figure 1E) that can be viewed in the spreadsheet pro-
grams, or, if only sequences are desired, may be downloaded
in Fasta format. Examples of inquiries that can be performed
on ApiDB are located in the supplementary material.
160FUTURE DIRECTIONS
ApiDB will be guided in large part by input from the user
communities of ApiDB, the component databases and the
objectives of the BRCs. An annual workshop on the usage
of apicomplexan database resources is not only a valuable
165opportunity for users to obtain hands-on instruction, but it
also provides a forum for feedback used to further drive
development of this site. As the autonomous component data-
bases evolve with new data and features, ApiDB will respond
to integrate these elements as appropriate. As data from
170phylogenetically related species becomes increasingly avail-
able, e.g. ciliates and Perkinsus, and perhaps, some day a
dinoflagellate, orthologous genes will be determined and
links will be provided, via orthology to these resources
when possible.
175The ApiDB website currently excludes queries of datasets
not found in all three component databases. For example,
PlasmoDB contains microarray-based gene expression data
whereas CryptoDB and ToxoDB presently do not. We will
investigate permitting the querying of a subset of the compo-
180nent databases through ApiDB. Feature enhancements that
will be available by early 2007 include persistent history to
allow users to save their search results and corresponding
results and a ‘sort’ tool to allow users to sort the results
they obtain from individual queries (Figure 1C) by species,
185gene ID or feature description.
Combinations of existing tools, pre-formed queries and
query history can be leveraged in powerful ways to mine
the apicomplexan data but do not lend themselves well
to high-throughput explorations. To facilitate large-scale
190database utilization, we will be providing programmatic
access to our facilities through the use of standard web
service technologies. Modular web service tasks will serve
as building blocks for creating a user-defined workflow. As
a single example, linking a series of tasks would enable a
195researcher with a collection of putative gene regulatory
D2 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 00, Database issue
motifs to perform a bulk series of BLAST searches of
chromosomal sequences, extract hit coordinates from the
report, then query for gene models downstream of each hit.
As our web services capabilities expand, we will use them
200 to permit workflows that include ClustalW (17) for multiple
sequence alignments. Web services may also be used to
collaborate with additional databases, including other BRCs
(http://BRC-central.org), to offer users integrated access to
additional pathogen data.
