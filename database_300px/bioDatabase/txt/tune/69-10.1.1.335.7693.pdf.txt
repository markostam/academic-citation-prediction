ABSTRACT
ArrayExpress is a public database for high through-
put functional genomics data. ArrayExpress con-
sists of two parts—the ArrayExpress Repository,
which is a MIAME supportive public archive of micro-
array data, and the ArrayExpress Data Warehouse,
which is a database of gene expression profiles
selected from the repository and consistently re-
annotated. Archived experiments can be queried by
experiment attributes, such as keywords, species,
array platform, authors, journals or accession num-
bers. Gene expression profiles can be queried by
gene names and properties, such as Gene Ontology
terms and gene expression profiles can be visual-
ized. ArrayExpress is a rapidly growing database,
currently it contains data from >50000 hybridiza-
tions and >1500 000 individual expression profiles.
ArrayExpress supports community standards,
including MIAME, MAGE-ML and more recently the
proposal for a spreadsheet based data exchange
format: MAGE-TAB.

INTRODUCTION
ArrayExpress (1) is a public database for storing and provid-
ing access to high throughput functional genomics data.
ArrayExpress consists of two components specialized for
distinct purposes—the ArrayExpress Repository of publicly
available archived experimental data and the ArrayExpress
Data Warehouse of gene expression profiles.
ArrayExpress REPOSITORY
The ArrayExpress repository is a MIAME compliant (2)
primary archive containing the original data related to
publications or generated by consortia. ArrayExpress is one
of the three databases recommended by the MGED society
(3) for depositions of publication related microarray data
the other two being Gene Expression Omnibus (4) and
CiBEX (5). ArrayExpress provides the means to store pre-
publication data confidentially whilst allowing access to
authorized users such as journal editors and referees. The
data are made publicly available upon publication of the
paper to which they relate. During the last 2 years the Array-
Express Repository has grown 5-fold to over 50 000
hybridizations (September 2006) organized into 1650 differ-
ent experiments. More than 90% of the experiments relate to
gene expression profiling studies, the remainder are array
based chromatin immunoprecipitation or comparative
genomics experiments. Over 200 different organisms are
represented, the largest contributors being human, mouse,
Arabidopsis, yeast and rat.
A new ArrayExpress experiment browse and query inter-
face (Figures 1 and 2) was released in 2006. It allows the
user to browse the entire content of the database in a sum-
mary view or query public datasets using free text and dis-
plays the query results in a summary view of up to 500
experiments per page which can be sorted by name, accession
number and load date, and filtered by array design, species,
date or availability of raw and processed data. For example,
the user can query for all experiments containing the phrase
‘bone marrow’ in their description, or retrieve experiments by
accession numbers (e.g. E-TABM-102), publication details,
array design names and journal names.
Each row in the summary view can be expanded to a
detailed view including experiment description and publica-
tion references. Queries can also be exported to spreadsheets
and saved. There are links to the original data files where
filled or empty icons indicate the presence or absence of
raw or normalized data. Each experiment has a link to spread-
sheets and graphs describing the sample properties and
experiment design. Linking to the ‘Detailed data retrieval
page’ allows for selection of particular Quantitation Types
(e.g. signal or log ratio) from multiple data files for specific
conditions. These can be exported into a single data matrix
for download, or uploaded to Expression profiler, an online
data analysis tool for further processing. An advanced

query interface is also provided http://www.ebi.ac.uk/aerep
for password-protected access to private data and complex
queries, e.g. all experiments performed on a specific array and
complex combinations of species/experiments.
ArrayExpress DATA WAREHOUSE
The ArrayExpress Data Warehouse currently contains
1 500 000 gene expression profiles from >2500 hybridizations.
s. It is currently populated with gene expression data from
ArrayExpress. Selection for inclusion is on the basis of
MIAME compliance, a curator’s assessment of quality of
annotation of the samples and arrays. For example, probe
sequences must be available for sequence based matching
or database identifiers that can be matched to Uniprot (6)
should be present for the majority of spots on an array.
The query interface to the ArrayExpress Data Warehouse
(Figures 3 and 4) allows the user to find gene expression pro-
files by gene name or identifier, database accession number
(e.g. UniProt) or other annotation such as Gene Ontology
terms. If a query returns more than one gene (for instance,
a query for BRCA will match BRCA1 and BRAC2), then a
list of matches is provided and the user can view the proper-
ties of these genes before selecting appropriate ones. The
default view is the gene identifier, synonyms, Gene Ontology
terms and links back to source databases. Once the user has
selected one or more genes, all the experiments containing
selected genes stored in the data warehouse are returned as
a list with thumbnail images of their expression profiles.
The user can then order this list by different statistical criteria
quantifying the ‘relevance’ of these experiments for the
selected genes, and can zoom in by clicking on these images,
and view more information. For instance, one can investigate
whether the expression of a selected gene changes with
experimental variables such as disease states or cell types.
Selecting genes with similar expression profiles, and the abil-
ity to export numerical values from the data warehouse is cur-
rently under development.
BULK DOWNLOADS
The ArrayExpress data can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.ebi.
ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/. Data files are made
available as either tab-delimited text files for two-color
experiments or native CEL format files (Affymetrix) within
zip archives. You can also download a graphical representa-
tion of each experiment, a spreadsheet showing the sample
annotation and a MAGE-ML format file from the ftp site.
ANALYZING MICROARRAY DATA IN
EXPRESSION PROFILER
Expression Profiler is an online microarray-data analysis tool
that can be used either to analyze data retrieved from Array-
Express or to analyze data uploaded from any other source,
such as the user’s own local private data (7). The user can
import data to Expression Profiler from the ArrayExpress
advanced query interface by selecting ‘Data Export to
Expression Profiler’, or can download zip archives from the
ArrayExpress browse interface and then upload them into
Expression Profiler for normalization and analysis. Expres-
sion Profiler provides distinct, chainable components for
clustering, pattern discovery, statistical analysis, machine-
learning algorithms and visualization. All of Expression
Profiler’s components can be accessed using SOAP-based
web services and can be incorporated into bioinformatics
workflows using Taverna (8).
DATA SUBMISSION AND CURATION
Data can be submitted to the ArrayExpress repository by one
of three routes.

Web based submissions
For submissions of up to 20 hybridizations the online sub-
mission tool MIAMExpress is recommended (http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/miamexpress/). A batch-loader for larger experiments
via this route is currently being tested and will be released
in 2006.
Spreadsheet submissions
Experiments of all types and sizes can be submitted as
spreadsheets, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/microarray/tab2
mage.cgi. A new template generation system provides a
user with a spreadsheet template based on technology type,
species and experiment type. The user then downloads the
spreadsheet, completes it, and uploads it with the data files.
The spreadsheet uses a simple ‘one-row-per-channel’ model
and is suitable for Affymetrix, two-color experiments and
Nimblegen technology, ChIP-chip and CGH. Our experience
with developing a spreadsheet based submission tool has led
to a community developed tab-delimited data exchange for-
mat MAGE-TAB (9) which will be supported in 2007.
Submissions from external microarray databases
Laboratories that have a local database can develop auto-
mated data export using the MAGE-ML or MAGE-TAB for-
mats, which can be submitted to ArrayExpress directly. The
ArrayExpress curators work with external databases when
setting up a data submission pipeline to ensure that data are
MIAME compliant and well formatted. Once a pipeline is
established, the submissions are curated at the source data-
base and monitored by ArrayExpress curators. MAGE-ML
based pipelines have been established from 20 external data-
bases, manufacturers or tools.
Curation
The ArrayExpress curation team processes each submission
of experimental data before it is loaded into the repository.
Submissions are checked for elements of MIAME compli-
ance, in particular, the presence of raw and processed data,
accuracy and completeness of biological information pro-
vided, including the presence of experimental factors and
their values in the sample annotation. Data consistency is
also checked, e.g. that submitted data files match the spe-
cified array designs and that data files are complete and
uncorrupted. ArrayExpress has been requested by journals
to provide a MIAME assessment service (10). This service
is available on request from miamexpress@ebi.ac.uk at pre-
sent, but all legacy data will have a MIAME score com-
puted which will be displayed in the ArrayExpress user
interface by the end of 2006 and will also be available
to reviewers viewing data supporting publications. The
MIAME scoring is currently used internally to select data
for the Data Warehouse, and the scoring system is
described in (10).
DATA WAREHOUSE CURATION
Ensembl (11) and UniProt (8) are used both as a source of
updated and additional annotation for arrays and both provide
access to gene expression data in the data warehouse from
their own databases. In Ensembl this is achieved via a DAS
track and since August 2006 in Uniprot (8) via database
cross-references.
There are two distinct methodologies for re-annotation and
an automated pipeline is in place for each
(i) Where the reporter sequences used on the array are public
and are matched on one of the Ensembl genome builds
Ensembl annotation is used. The process of mapping
sequences for array features (probes) to genes is described
in the Ensembl user documentation (http://www.ensembl.
org/info/data/docs/microarray_probe_set_mapping.html).
(ii) Where no Reporter sequences are publicly available,
Reporters are not mapped, or the species is not included
in Ensembl, identifier matches in the UniProt database
are used to acquire additional annotation.
As Ensembl has a frequent release cycle and annotation
changes and probes can be re-mapped during this process
we have designed an annotation update pipeline. An internal
tracking database is used to store information on Ensembl
annotation for probes on a weekly basis. When new

annotation is detected old annotation is deleted from the data
warehouse for probes and updated annotation extracted from
Ensembl is inserted. Our version tracking system allows us to
check statistics for the probes on specific arrays. For example,
the percentage of probes from a given array that fail to map to
the genome is monitored and can be checked for anomalies
between Ensembl releases for each array design.
Experiments are identified as being suitable for inclusion in
the Data Warehouse at the point of submission by matching
the following criteria: the experiments must use an array that
can be re-annotated, have normalized and processed data and
be gene expression experiments that are MIAME compliant.
The data warehouse provides an environment to update the
annotation for arrays; however, the original array annotation
supporting the publication is maintained in the repository in
the state that it was submitted. Submitters are therefore not
permitted to re-annotate arrays linked to published data as
this may affect conclusions drawn from these data reported
in the paper and this is inconsistent with the archival role
of the ArrayExpress repository.
FUTURE
The ArrayExpress database has been online since 2002 and
has not only grown from a few hundred to >50 000 hybridiza-
tions, but also has undergone major software and usability
improvements. This is a continuous process, and among the
immediate tasks are implementing more powerful query
mechanisms to deal with providing simple access to large
volumes of data, providing webservices, and deeper integra-
tion with the data analysis, mining and visualization tool
Expression Profiler. We are constantly improving the ease
of submission to ArrayExpress, and we expect that the new
generation of submission tools, together with a wide adoption
of MAGE-TAB format will further increase the ease of
submission. MAGE-TAB will be supported at ArrayExpress
in 2007.
A prototype XML interface is available which exposes
Experiment level information plus sample annotation. Pro-
grammatic interfaces are under development and we invite
users to submit their use cases for such systems. MIAME
scores will be computed for each experiment and displayed
in the user interface for all legacy data as well as for new sub-
missions.
In the future, as the community develops data quality met-
rics, we will include these as criteria for inclusion of data in
the Data Warehouse and we will display these for experiment
submissions.
Work is under way to integrate the most commonly used
Bioconductor modules into Expression Profiler during the
next 12 months, thereby providing a web interface to these.
Finally, we have begun a gene atlas project where data in
the public domain are re-normalized consistently in-house
and will be loaded into the Data Warehouse as supersets
of data.
