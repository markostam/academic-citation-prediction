Abstract 
Combining or pooling individual samples when carrying out transcript profiling using 
microarrays is a fairly common means to reduce both the cost and complexity of data analysis. 
However, pooling does not allow for statistical comparison of changes between samples and can 
result in a loss of information.  Since a rigorous comparison of the identified expression changes 
from the two approaches has not been reported, we compared the results for hepatic transcript 
profiles from pooled versus individual samples.  Hepatic transcript profiles from a single dose 
time course rat study in response to the prototypical toxicants, clofibrate (CLO), 
diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) and valproic acid (VPA) were evaluated.  Approximately 50% 
more transcript expression changes were observed in the individual (statistical) analysis as 
compared to the pooled analysis.  While the majority of these changes were less than 2-fold in 
magnitude (~80%), a substantial number were greater than 2-fold (~20%).  Transcript changes 
unique to the individual analysis were confirmed by QRTPCR while all the changes unique to 
the pooled analysis did not confirm. The individual analysis identified more hits per biological 
pathway than the pooled approach.  Many of the transcripts identified by the individual analysis 
were novel findings and may contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanism of 
these compounds. Furthermore, having individual animal data provided the opportunity to 
correlate changes in transcript expression to phenotypes (i.e. histology) observed in toxicology 
studies. The two approaches were similar when clustering methods were used despite the large 
difference in the absolute number of transcripts changed.  In summary, pooling reduced resource 
requirements substantially but the individual approach enabled statistical analysis that identified 
more gene expression changes to evaluate mechanism of toxicity. An individual animal approach 
 3
becomes more valuable when the overall expression response is subtle and/or when associating 
expression data to variable phenotypic responses.

Introduction 
Microarray technology has enabled the measurement of mRNA abundance on a genomic 
scale, providing deeper insight into cellular physiology.  Microarrays have been applied to many 
types of biological inquiry such as studying response to environmental changes (15), 
classification of tumors (37), classification of compound therapeutic mechanism (6), and 
prediction of cancer prognosis to name only a few.  In toxicology, there has been substantial 
effort in applying microarray technology as a tool to identify biomarkers (35), develop surrogate 
toxicity assays (22), determine mechanism (42) and predict toxicity (18).  There have been a 
number of reviews covering the application of microarray technology to toxicology more 
extensively (26, 34). 
Despite demonstrated utility, there are many challenges in using microarrays. Among 
them is the task of extracting useful biological information from the enormous amount of data 
generated. This challenge has been aided by the development of many new tools over the last 
few years that facilitate data reduction, visualization and analysis (13, 49).  Another prominent, 
yet largely unaddressed challenge, is that appropriately powered experimental designs using 
microarrays can be costly and time consuming (52).   This cost has led many scientists to the 
practice of pooling replicate biological samples, which not only decreases the number of 
microarrays needed, but also reduces sample preparation for a given study.  However, with the 
practice of pooling comes a loss of opportunity to apply statistical analysis methods that enable 
the measurement of individual animal variation within the experiment.  Furthermore, the ability 
to correlate individual transcript expression changes back to individual animal phenotypes, 
which often vary within treatment groups, is lost. This correlation is critical for identification of 
biomarkers and modeling response. Ultimately the effect of pooling samples as opposed to a 
 5
statistical analysis of individual samples relates to the balancing of costs versus a tolerance for 
lack of statistical confidence in the data.   
   Literature on the topic of pooling samples for microarray experiments tend to be 
technical reports of formulas for calculating the number of biological samples (pooled or 
individual) needed for a properly powered analysis (23, 24, 28, 32, 44). However, this study 
examines the impact of pooling samples from both a qualitative or  “biological” perspective and 
a quantitative viewpoint. We used the same single-dose time course toxicology samples and 
pooled them or processed them individually.  Three well characterized prototypical toxicants, 
CLO, DEHP and VPA were selected based upon: 1) knowledge of their mechanism(s) in the 
scientific literature, 2) the robust expression response in liver following treatment and, 3) their 
relative effect upon PPAR receptors (3, 16, 33, 38, 48). The analysis methods employed for 
analyzing data from pooled or individual sample designs were those typical for microarray users 
when utilizing the respective designs. This analysis allows researchers to make informed 
decisions as to appropriate experimental design and sample processing based on their needs and 
resource constraints.

Materials and Methods 
Experimental:  Male SD rats (n=5) were given a single dose of test article p.o. and sacrificed 
48 and 168 hours post exposure as previously described (29). Additional groups of animals were 
sacrificed at 4 and 24 hours (n=3) after exposure see supplemental materials. Doses were 
selected based upon what was needed to obtain acute hepatotoxicity as determined by range 
finding studies (data not shown).  Clofibrate was dosed at 1000 mg/kg using 0.9% w/v saline as a 
vehicle (10 ml/kg).  DEHP was dosed at 20 g/kg (20ml/kg) and Valproic acid at 2000 mg/kg 
(10ml/kg) using distilled water as a vehicle. One animal in the VPA group died prior to sacrifice. 
Animals were sacrificed and toxicity was evaluated by clinical chemistry, measuring liver 
weights and histological examination of the liver after staining with H&E.  
  RNA isolation and Microarray analysis: Total RNA from liver was isolated with RNA 
STAT-60 (Tel-Test inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the POOLED samples, equal 
amounts of total RNA from each sample within a given treatment group were combined. 10µg of 
total RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix RG_U34A arrays according to the 
Affymetrix protocol (1). Affymetrix fluidics station 400 and Agilent GeneArray scanner 3000 
were used. Each sample was hybridized to a single microarray. 
Sample Quality:  All samples were assessed for RNA quality such as microarray scaling 
factors, background levels, percent present calls and β-Actin and GAPDH 3’/5’ ratios etc.  
Samples with high 3’/5’ ratios would usually be excluded from further analysis, however, the 
CLO samples were pooled before the results for the individual animal microarrays were 
completed. For the remaining two compounds, samples were pooled after the quality of the 
individual samples was assessed, thus ensuring that the pools for VPA and DEHP contained only 
high quality samples. This design allowed us to compare the two analysis methods as a worst-
 7
case scenario (CLO, with 7 of 26 samples being of suspect quality RNA), and a best-case 
scenario (VPA and DEHP, where all of the samples are high quality).  The data discussed in this 
publication have been deposited in NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number 
GSE 2303. 
Data analysis of INDIVIDUAL samples: Signal intensities were generated from Microarray Suite 
version 5.0 (MAS5) using the default settings, and a global scaling set to 1500.  To apply 
statistical analysis to the experiment, the fold-change was calculated as the ratio of the two group 
means based on the observed signal values from MAS5 for the two treatment groups.  
To test whether a gene is differentially expressed, an ANOVA model was fitted on each of the 
8799 probe sets on the chip. The intensity value, Affymetrix MAS5 signal, of a particular gene 
was modeled as  
                     kikkiY εµ +=         k = 1 ,… ,4;  i = 1, …, I;   
Where Yki is the signal of animal i from treatment group k, kµ is the group mean of treatment k, 
and kiε  is the measurement error (combination of sample variation and chip-to-chip variation) 
following distribution N(0, 2σ  ). 
    Since thousands of hypotheses were tested simultaneously, the issue of multiplicity is a 
concern. To estimate the false positives, Benjamini and Hochberg’s (Benjamini and Hochberg, 
1995) False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to adjust the pvalues derived from the above 
ANOVA model. Since FDR estimates the proportion of false positives among the tests called 
‘significant’, the cutoff value of FDR in a particular study is flexible depending on the goal of 
the experiment. For instance, an FDR of 0.1 represents a tolerance of 10% of false positives 
among the selected ‘significant’ genes 
 8
Data analysis for POOLED samples:  Signal intensities were generated using MAS5 as 
described above and fold-change values were obtained by running a comparison analysis in 
MAS5 using the default settings. The MAS5 fold-change output is the Signal Log Ratio (SLR), 
which is the fold-change, presented in Log2. In order to simplify the comparison with the 
INDIVIDUAL analysis, the SLR was converted to a standard, non-logarithmic scale. 
Filtering criteria: All changes for the INDIVIDUAL analysis had an FDR ≤0.1, a minimum 
signal of 500 for either the vehicle or treated samples, and an absolute fold-change of ≥1.4. For 
the POOLED analysis, changes had an MAS5 call of increase or decrease, an absolute fold-change 
of at least 2, a minimum signal of 500 for either the vehicle or treated samples, and not called 
absent in both vehicle and treated samples. Analysis of these data showed that Signal values 
below ~500 had a high coefficient of variation (data not shown).  The 1.4-fold minimum change 
for the statistical analysis was arbitrarily chosen to remove small changes that have not 
consistently validated using QRTPCR (data not shown).  A lower fold-change cut-off for the 
statistically analyzed data was implemented as a result of the additional confidence gained from 
a 10% False Discovery Rate. The 2-fold minimum for MAS5 changes was based upon guidance 
from Affymetrix.  Implementing a 2-fold cut-off for both analyses resulted in a greater overlap 
between the two methods, but there were still numerous statistically significant changes missed 
by pooling and the false positives remained (see supplemental materials). 
Principle Component Analysis (PCA):  PCA analysis was performed as described by Yeung 
(53) using the R statistical package (www.R-project.org) and data were standardized using a Z-
score calculation prior to PCA. The PCA scores corresponding to the first three principal 
components were imported into Spotfire Decision Suite 7.2 for visualization. To include all 
 9
observable variation in the experiment and to avoid sample grouping caused by transcript 
selection, all probe sets on the chip were used (2, 36).  
Hierarchical clustering (HCS): HCS was performed using the Pearson correlation as the 
distance metric, and average linkage clustering in Spotfire Decision Site.  The data was clustered 
based on the MAS5 signal for all 8799 probe sets. 
Pathway mapping of expression data:  Mapping of expression data was performed using 
GenMapp2.0 and MappFinder 2.0 (11, 12). MappFinder identified the number of genes changing 
for a number of pathways, as well as providing a statistical evaluation of the overrepresentation 
of modulated genes within the various pathways. Since not all of the genes in a given pathway 
have been annotated to the RG_U34A chip, the data was formatted so that the pathway content 
of the RG_U34A chip was used for the background in the statistical calculations. MappFinder 
positive z-scores indicate that the number of modulated genes in the pathway is greater than 
expected by chance. Larger z-scores represent greater significance. Once modulated pathways 
were identified using MappFinder, the data was overlaid onto pathway visualization maps, and 
colored based on whether a transcript was detected by POOLED, INDIVIDUAL, or both approaches. 
QRTPCR: We used quantitative PCR (QRTPCR) to validate the array data. Total RNA was 
treated with DNase (DNA-free, Ambion), and subsequently, 1.5 µg was used for first-strand 
cDNA synthesis (Superscript II, Invitrogen) followed by QRTPCR using SYBR green (Applied 
Biosystems). Transcripts for confirmation were picked arbitrarily representing a range of fold 
change and signal change from the different subsets in the data.  Since the goal of these 
experiments was to validate the technical results from the two approaches, the same preparation 
of RNA as were hybridized to the arrays was used.  The QRTPCR results represent the mean 
values from each dosing group.  Aldehyde reductase was used as an internal control. As shown 
 10
in Table 1, aldehyde reductase expression levels remained consistent across all treatments. Fold 
changes were calculated by dividing the gene of interest/internal control for the treatment by 
GOI/ctrl for the vehicle samples. Statistical analysis (t-test) was performed on the QRTPCR 
results from individual animals for each transcript using the JMP statistical package (version 
4.0.4).  Additional details on this method, including primer sequences, can be found in the 
supplemental materials.

Results 
 The transcriptional response to the toxicants was dynamic over the time course (Figure 
1). Although the time-dependence of the transcriptional response within the POOLED and 
INDIVIDUAL analyses was similar, there were more significant transcript changes observed in the 
individual dataset. Both analyses revealed maximal responses in gene expression at 24 or 48 
hours.  The 48-hr data were focused upon because it had the largest transcription response 
(number of changes) and the most robust change in liver phenotype (liver weight increase as well 
as minimal changes in morphology) occurred at this time point.  
We compared the probe sets identified as differentially expressed relative to control in 
the POOLED and INDIVIDUAL analysis to determine if probe sets in the POOLED observations were a 
subset of those in the INDIVIDUAL dataset. The percent overlap of the two approaches was   ~30% 
for all compounds (Figure 2 A, B, and C). Most of the POOLED changes were also identified 
within the INDIVIDUAL set of significant changes as demonstrated by the small number of 
transcripts unique to the POOLED analysis (5% and 3% for DEHP and VPA respectively, and 20% 
of the total for CLO).. In contrast, a large percentage of changes from the INDIVIDUAL analysis 
(49-67%) were not found in the POOLED data set. The majority of these probe sets had expression 
changes of less than 2-fold, but there were numerous transcripts (14-20%) greater than 2-fold 
that were also not identified by the POOLED analysis (Figure 2 A, B, C).  Similar results were 
obtained with data at the 4 and 24-hr time points showing that a significant fraction of data was 
lost even where there were fewer total transcript changes (supplemental materials).   
 QRTPCR analysis of transcript changes falling in the various regions of the Venn 
diagram, generated from the data set, highlights additional differences between the approaches.  
Five or six transcripts from each of the three regions of the Venn diagram representing unique 
 12
and overlapping areas of the VPA data set (Figure 2C) were arbitrarily chosen for technical 
confirmation by QRTPCR of the VPA samples. The results from the QRTPCR analysis are 
shown in Table 1. It is striking to note that none of the transcripts unique to the VPA POOLED 
analysis were confirmed as being statistically significant (p-value ≤0.05) when the individual 
samples were evaluated by QRTPCR, suggesting a high false positive rate for this subset of 
transcripts upon pooling. The changes for both the overlap and the transcripts detected uniquely 
in the individual samples were confirmed by QRTPCR as being statistically significant changes. 
Therefore, all changes identified by the statistical microarray analysis and tested by QRTPCR 
were confirmed. Among these transcripts, the INDIVIDUAL analysis identified three transcripts 
(sodium channel β-1, selenoprotein W, and lanosterol 14-demethylase) called “not changed” by 
the MAS5 algorithm and therefore missed by the POOLED approach. Each of these transcripts 
were strongly regulated (5.7, 2.3, and -5.3 fold, respectively), detected by the individual analysis 
and were significantly regulated when checked by QRTPCR.  
To determine the impact of a POOLED versus INDIVIDUAL analysis on sample classification,  
all 48 hour array data was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical 
clustering (HCS), as shown in Figure 3A.  Treatment with the three toxicants separated from the 
vehicle along the first and second principal components while differences between compounds 
separated along the third principal component.  A clear compound dependent effect relative to 
vehicle control was observed using PCA. As expected, the pooled samples for each compound 
consistently clustered tightly with the individual samples from their respective groups in the 
PCA.  
The VPA and DEHP samples clustered more closely together than with CLO.  In 
addition, the spread between the individual animals in the CLO group was larger in magnitude 
 13
than observed for the other compounds. CLO samples that were distanced from the center of the 
clusters in PCA were lower quality samples.  Three of the five vehicle-treated animals 
(methylcellulose in the CLO study) had 3’/5’ β-actin ratios of greater than3, and two of five 
CLO-treated animals had ratios of greater than3 indicating that the RNA was partially degraded 
before labeling the samples.  While these parameters were outside of normal ranges, other QC 
parameters for these samples were within normal limits. All other CLO samples including 
POOLED samples had β-actin 3’/5’ ratios less than 3. Samples from the VPA and DEHP 
experiments all had β-actin 3’/5’ ratios of less than 2 indicating higher quality RNA. When the 
data were analyzed by HCS (Figure 3B), another common method for microarray analysis and 
visualization, the different treatments were clearly separated from their respective vehicles and 
each other.  The data separated into three distinct clusters, VPA and DEHP formed one cluster, 
CLO formed another and the vehicle treatments formed a third cluster.  The vehicle for VPA and 
DEHP (water), clustered in one branch while the vehicle for CLO (methylcellulose), clustered in 
another.  For all three treatments and the vehicles, the pooled samples clustered with the 
individual samples from their respective groups, as expected.  Thus, even though the INDIVIDUAL 
approach identified more significant changes in expression, both approaches resulted in similar 
separation of treatments when the data were analyzed by HCS.   
Minimal changes in pathology were observed in these studies and all changes were 
reversed by 168 hours after treatment. Some vacuolation, hypertrophy and increases in mitotic 
figures were noted, however the most dramatic response to the compounds was an increase in 
absolute liver weight noted at 24 and 48 hours. An advantage of the INDIVIDUAL approach is the 
opportunity to correlate the transcript profiles to the phenotype, sometimes called “phenotypic 
anchoring”.  For example, a subtle increase in liver weight was observed in the CLO treated 
 14
animals at 48 hours.  Spearman’s’s correlation was used to identify specific transcripts that 
correlate with increased liver weight (Figure 4 A, B, C).  Hydratase dehydrogenase, a known 
PPAR alpha regulated transcript, was clearly up-regulated by CLO treatment (FDR <0.001) but 
was not highly correlated to increased liver weight. Retinol dehydrogenase, although not 
associated with PPAR alpha activation (FDR >0.1), was highly correlated to liver weight 
increase. Lastly, Acyl CoA synthetase 4 was significantly regulated by treatment (FDR =0.03) 
and correlated to increased liver weight. Thus, the INDIVIDUAL approach enables both statistical 
analysis and correlation to phenotype allowing for deeper investigation of the data.  
 The POOLED and INDIVIDUAL data from each compound were also mapped to metabolic 
pathways using GenMapp (11, 12) in order to compare pathways identified by each analytical 
approach. The mitochondrial long chain fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway is illustrated in Figure 
5 for VPA (figures for all three compounds can be found in the supplemental materials). As 
might be expected, all three compounds modulated multiple transcripts that code for components 
of the beta-oxidation pathway (Table 2).  The INDIVIDUAL analysis identified more components of 
the pathway than did the POOLED analysis yet both approaches identified this pathway as having 
more of its genes modulated than would be expected by random chance. Table 2 shows the 
results when this pathway analysis was generalized to all GenMapp pathways using the 
MappFinder tool..  Again, it was apparent that the POOLED analysis generally resulted in fewer 
transcript changes per pathway relative to the INDIVIDUAL method; however, both methods 
identified major pathways affected by these compounds.  Notable pathways missed by the 
POOLED method include proteasome degradation, ribosomal proteins, oxidative stress, cell cycle, 
apoptosis and the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathway in response to DEHP or 
 15
VPA. Also, note that the arginine and proline metabolism pathway was identified by the CLO 
POOLED, not INDIVIDUAL analysis.

Discussion 
There is considerable anecdotal data and opinion on the value of using an individual 
versus pooled microarray experimental design; however, there is a paucity of rigorous 
comparative analysis in the scientific literature. Lee et al emphasized the importance of statistics 
in array studies in the classification of transcripts among tumor samples (28). In support of 
pooling, Waring et al showed that pooled samples cluster with the individual samples from 
which they were derived (44). Recently, papers by Peng et al , Kendziorski et al, and 
Kendziorski et al have found that sub-pooling is a statistically viable method for analysis of 
array results; particularly where the biological variation is expected to be much larger than the 
technical variation of the microarray (23, 24, 32).  In sub-pooling, multiple animals from within 
a treatment group are pooled into multiple, evenly distributed sub-groups, thus reducing the 
variability as well as the number of microarrays that are processed. Two  of these papers are 
based primarily on an in-silico analysis and each suggest that in order to achieve the same level 
of precision, sub-pooling requires substantially more biological samples than is needed for 
individual samples.  This is not cost effective for many in vivo experiments. Although these 
studies have examined the pros and cons of both designs to some degree, none has directly 
compared the expression changes observed using typical analytical methods commonly 
associated each design. 
The rationale for pooling samples tends to be non-technical (limited sample RNA) and 
generally involves savings in time and reagent costs. In our experience time and cost can be 
reduced up to five fold by pooling samples.  The benefits of an individual animal approach are 
many and include: 1) estimation of biological variation, 2) robust statistical testing as opposed to 
heuristic filtering and, 3) association with phenotypic data when available 4) more information to 
 17
apply to mechanistic analysis.  Statistics provide a quantitative measure of the probability of 
false positives in the data based upon signal relative to noise and observed sample variation. 
Therefore, statistical measures of confidence, such as FDR, provide a mechanism for rational 
data filtering that incorporates knowledge of false positive rates. In our comparison of POOLED 
and INDIVIDUAL design, changes unique to the POOLED analysis did not validate when evaluated 
with QRTPCR (n=5) using individual sample RNA, indicating that they are likely to be false 
positives (Table 1). This loss in confirmation of transcripts by QRTPCR was a result of large 
variation in signal between samples within the treatment group as opposed to a technical problem 
related to the probe sets representing these transcripts on the microarray. This is supported by the 
observation that we could confirm the unique to pooled changes by QRTPCR using pooled 
sample RNA (data not shown). The changes identified from the pooled data set that failed to 
validate can impact the interpretation of the data as demonstrated by the fact that at 168 hours 
post-dosing, CLO still regulated a number of changes (supplemental materials) in the pooled 
samples, but none of these changes were statistically significant.  
The expression changes uniquely identified by the individual analysis enhanced 
biological interpretation of the experiment. Three regulated transcripts identified in the 
INDIVIDUAL analysis were sodium channel β-1, selenoprotein W, and lanosterol 14-demethylase 
that were called “not changed” by MAS5 and therefore not called changed in the POOLED 
approach. These transcripts were strongly regulated (> 5-fold) and were confirmed by QRTPCR 
(with primers designed independently of the probe sequences on the arrays) Each of the three 
transcripts had a high level of hybridization to the Affymetrix mismatch probes, providing an 
explanation for why MAS5 did not pick up the change.  Interestingly, VPA has been shown to 
modulate sodium channel β-1 and this is likely associated with its pharmacological mechanism 
 18
of action (51).  The increase in lanosterol-14-demethylase transcript after VPA treatment has not 
been reported previously. This enzyme is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and trafficking of 
sterols.  Down regulation of this transcript and the cholesterol esterase (Table 1; a subtle -1.5 
fold change also only detected in the INDIVIDUAL analysis) by VPA, may contribute to the steatotic 
effect in liver observed after VPA treatment (21, 39).  Other transcripts involved in lipid 
metabolism that were strongly regulated by VPA, and determined only in the INDIVIDUAL analysis, 
include Acyl CoA synthetase 4 (11-fold increase), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor 
transcript (13-fold increase).  Additionally, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a 
mitochondrial protein integral in intermediate shuttling and bioenergetics, was regulated by VPA 
(8 fold increase). These are just a few examples of biologically relevant changes that analysis of 
pooled samples did not identify.  
Statistical analysis increases assay sensitivity, enabling confident identification of subtle 
changes and detection of changes that may be characterized by greater variability. 
Approximately half of the transcriptional changes detected by INDIVIDUAL design were not 
detected in the POOLED design (Figures 1 and 2), a result similar to those reported by others (14).  
While most of the transcript changes detected by the INDIVIDUAL design had fold-changes less than 
two, 20% of these changes were greater than two (Figure 2).  The identification of additional 
differentially expressed transcripts, even if subtle, increases the sensitivity in identifying 
modulated pathways that can impact biological interpretation of data. Here, gene expression 
changes were mapped to the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, a pathway that all of these 
compounds are known to affect via their interaction with the PPAR alpha receptor (54).  It was 
clear from this exercise that the POOLED versus INDIVIDUAL analysis gave the same result from a 
high level view; i.e. expected effects on fatty acid oxidation were evident for both approaches.  
 19
Still some important differences were evident using this comparative analysis.  For example, the 
INDIVIDUAL analysis of VPA detected a change in the long chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
mRNA where the POOLED analysis did not. This enzyme is inhibited by both VPA and its active 
metabolite (25); thus, an important piece of mechanistic information about VPA was missed by 
pooling. Further discrepancies between the methods were apparent upon the analysis of 
additional pathways.  INDIVIDUAL analysis identified more pathways, and had greater 
representation within pathways than the POOLED analysis. Ribosomal (DEHP), apoptosis (DEHP), 
proteosomal degradation (DEHP), oxidative stress (VPA), and cell cycle (VPA) transcripts were 
identified only in the INDIVIDUAL analysis. Ribosomal protein transcripts are modulated in stress 
response and tissue regeneration (27, 31, 50). Although only DEHP modulated more ribosomal 
protein transcripts than expected by chance, INDIVIDUAL analysis of VPA and CLO also detected 
changes in 12 and 3 of these transcripts respectively. Activation of the ribosomal transcripts 
modulated by these 3 compounds have been associated with hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat (8, 
9), an interesting finding given that PPAR alpha agonists are non-genotoxic carcinogens in 
rodents. The implications of elevated proteasomal transcripts are not clear; however, regulation 
by all compounds of a family of transcripts indicates a treatment related effect. DEHP toxicity 
has been shown to involve apoptosis(20), while VPA has been shown to induce oxidative stress 
in rats(41). Clearly, additional insight into these toxicants’ mechanism of action was gained 
utilizing the INDIVIDUAL approach.   
Subtle changes in transcript abundance identified by statistical analysis may also be 
biologically interesting since a number of laboratories have demonstrated discordance between 
mRNA and protein levels (5, 10, 17, 19, 45). Subtle changes in mRNA abundance may relate to 
a dramatic impact on protein activity that may be missed without the sensitivity enabled by 
 20
statistical methods. Transcription factors such as nuclear hormone receptors represent such a 
class of genes.  Another key benefit of INDIVIDUAL analysis is that it enables the correlation of 
each animal’s microarray results to phenotypes measured within an experiment. Variability in 
phenotype severity across multiple animals treated identically often complicates correlation 
analysis, and pooling samples does not allow discrimination between responders and non-
responders. In this study, several transcript changes correlated to the PPAR-alpha induced 
increase in liver weight (Figure 4).  The high correlation observed for retinol dehydrogenase was 
more a result of change in expression in vehicle animals rather than in treated animals indicating 
that this was not a compound effect. This was not the case for acyl CoA synthetase where the 
high correlation supports a treatment related effect. Regardless of the interpretation, this analysis 
illustrated the utility of correlating changes in a given transcript with a given phenotype.  
Correlations between transcript abundance and phenotypes can be useful to identify cause and 
effect relationships or in the identification of novel biomarkers. For example, within standard 
toxicology live phase experiments, serum clinical chemistry parameters are measured and 
histopathology observations are routinely captured. Understanding the correlation between 
clinical chemistry and gene expression could lead to additional markers that provide mechanistic 
information regarding the type of injury. 
Clustering algorithms are often used to classify expression patterns as similar or different.  
In both PCA and HCS, the pooled samples fell into clusters with their corresponding individual 
animal samples. Waring et al also demonstrated that pooling samples did not alter their ability to 
use unsupervised clustering methods to compare overall sample similarity (44).  Given that 
significant numbers of transcripts were missed with the POOLED approach, it would appear that 
clustering methods are insensitive to subtle changes in a large population of transcript changes. 
 21
However, there were apparently enough significant changes in the POOLED data to drive the 
algorithm to a similar clustering of treatments.  Interestingly, VPA and DEHP clustered more 
tightly together than with CLO regardless of the analysis.  There is no evidence that DEHP 
causes microvesicular steatosis in the literature, but there is data indicating that VPA causes a 
slight PPAR type response (Gonzalez 1998).  These data show that clustering does not separate 
an inhibition of beta-oxidation from up-regulation of this pathway.  The quality of samples can 
impact array data as demonstrated by the larger spread on the PCA chart for some of the CLO 
samples (treatment and vehicles). Some of these samples had an unacceptable amount 
ofdegradation as assessed from control probes on the microarrays and could have been excluded 
from analysis. This difference in sample integrity between CLO and the other compounds may 
be evident in Figures 1 and 2 where CLO had fewer transcripts unique to INDIVIDUAL analysis, 
relative to the POOLED analysis since a statistical analysis is more sensitive to variability between 
samples. These observations underscore a potential risk of pooling samples. Just one degraded or 
contaminated sample can negatively impact the quality of data for a particular pool and 
potentially confound results.  
In summary, while the two approaches to running microarray chips were comparable, 
pooling saves considerable time and resources at the expense of statistical confidence in the data. 
The ability to correlate expression data to other datasets and phenotypes can be critical for 
effective modeling, the building of training sets or biomarker discovery (7, 30).  As has been 
done with the classification of cancers, the analysis of individual samples is required to provide 
appropriate power for predictive modeling (4, 40, 46, 47). This is an important issue in 
toxicology since microarrays have been heralded for their potential use in building a predictive 
database of prototypical toxicants (26, 43). As we have seen, the INDIVIDUAL analysis revealed 
 22
subtle changes that affect interpretation of the experiment that was lost in the POOLED analysis 
and important for mechanistic understanding.  Although there are dissenting opinions as to the 
value of pooled or individual experimental designs, an INDIVIDUAL approach becomes more 
valuable where the variation in phenotypic response is large and/or the overall response is subtle.  
A POOLED approach is better employed where the expected response or phenotype is robust and 
its variation in that response is minimal.

Figure Legends 
Figure 1. Number of transcripts changed when samples were pooled or run individually. The 
graph represents the number of probe sets on the chip that pass the filtering criteria for each time 
point post-administration of the toxicant.  Filtering criteria for both approaches are in materials 
and methods.   
 
Figure 2. A) CLO, B) DEHP, C) VPA. Overlap of probe sets changed between approaches at 
48 hours. The number of probe sets unique to the individual analysis that have absolute fold-
changes of greater than 2-fold are listed.  Filtering criteria for both approaches are in materials 
and methods.  All changes within the overlapping section of the Venn diagrams are concordant 
as to the direction of change.  
 
Figure 3. PCA and HCS analysis of all POOLED and INDIVIDUAL 48hr microarray data.  Circles 
represent the pooled samples and triangles represent the individual samples while color 
delineates treatment by compound: Red=Clo, Blue=DEHP, Yellow=VPA, Green=Vehicle. PCA 
captured 65% of the variation observed in the experiment in the first 3 principal components.   
 
Figure 4. Correlation of transcript changes to liver weight.  Gene expression data collected 48 hr 
after CLO treatment was correlated to liver/brain weight ratios using the Spearman’s Rho.  For 
each probe set the correlation of expression change to liver weight is listed. Grey boxes represent 
vehicle control and black boxes represent treatment with CLO. A) K03249_at; Hydratase 
dehydrogenase; example where there is a treatment effect but small correlation to liver weight B) 
U33500_at; Retinol dehydrogenase; an example of no treatment effect but strong correlation to 
 32
liver weight C) RC1236284_at; Acyl CoA synthetase 4; an example of a treatment effect and 
correlation to liver weight.   
  
Figure 5. Effect of VPA on mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. The Mitochondrial Fatty Acid 
β-oxidation pathway was adapted from GenMapp, and colored to demonstrate what transcripts 
are changing at 48hr (in this case, all of the transcripts are induced by treatment) as detected by 
both pooling and individual methods (green shading) or only by individual samples (blue 
shading). Additional diagrams of the Mitochondrial Fatty Acid β-oxidation pathway for DEHP 
and CLO can be found in the supplemental materials. 
 
Table 1. QRTPCR Confirmation.  5-6 probesets were arbitrarily chosen from different regions of 
the Venn diagram in Figure 2 of the VPA 48 hr samples for technical confirmation. This table 
compares the microarray data for these probe sets for both approaches as well as the QRTPCR 
results when samples were run individually and pooled together.    
 
 
Table 2. Impact of approaches on compound-related effects assessed by pathway analysis. The 
48 hr array data for three compounds were applied to GenMapp pathways using the MappFinder 
tool.  Pathways listed had a positive z-score for at least one treatment and analysis, and a 
minimum of five transcripts per pathway needed to be changed for a given pathway to be listed. 
The shaded values reflect a z-score below zero, indicating that for that treatment, the pathway is 
under-represented.
