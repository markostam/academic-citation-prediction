ABSTRACT
A novel microRNA (miRNA) quantification method
has been developed using stem–loop RT followed
by TaqMan PCR analysis. Stem–loop RT primers are
better than conventional ones in terms of RT effici-
ency and specificity. TaqMan miRNA assays are spe-
cific for mature miRNAs and discriminate among
related miRNAs that differ by as little as one nucleot-
ide. Furthermore, they are not affected by genomic
DNA contamination. Precise quantification is
achieved routinely with as little as 25 pg of total
RNA for most miRNAs. In fact, the high sensitivity,
specificity and precision of this method allows for
direct analysis of a single cell without nucleic acid
purification. Like standard TaqMan gene expression
assays, TaqMan miRNA assays exhibit a dynamic
range of seven orders of magnitude. Quantification
of five miRNAs in seven mouse tissues showed vari-
ation from less than 10 to more than 30 000 copies per
cell. This method enables fast, accurate and sensitive
miRNA expression profiling and can identify and
monitor potential biomarkers specific to tissues or
diseases. Stem–loop RT–PCR can be used for the
quantification of other small RNA molecules such
as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Furthermore, the
concept of stem–loop RT primer design could be
applied in small RNA cloning and multiplex assays
for better specificity and efficiency.
INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are naturally occurring, highly con-
served families of transcripts (18–25 nt in length) that are
processed from larger hairpin precursors (1,2). miRNAs are
found in the genomes of animals (3–9) and plants (10–12). To
date, there are 1000 unique transcripts, including 326 human
miRNAs in the Sanger Center miRNA registry (13).
miRNAs regulate gene expression by catalyzing the cleav-
age of messenger RNA (mRNA) (14–19) or repressing mRNA
translation (19–21). They are believed to be critical in cell
development, differentiation and communication (2). Specific
roles include the regulation of cell proliferation and metabol-
ism (22), developmental timing (23,24), cell death (25),
haematopoiesis (26), neuron development (27), human
tumorigenesis (28) and DNA methylation and chromatin
modification (29).
Although miRNAs represent a relatively abundant class of
transcripts, their expression levels vary greatly among species
and tissues (30). Less abundant miRNAs routinely escape
detection with technologies such as cloning, northern hybrid-
ization (31) and microarray analysis (32,33). Here, we present
a novel real-time quantification method for accurate and sens-
itive detection of miRNAs and other small RNAs. This method
expands the real-time PCR technology for detecting gene
expression changes from macromolecules (e.g. mRNAs) to
micro molecules (e.g. miRNAs).

Tissue RNA samples, cells, cell lysates and
total RNA preparation
Mouse total RNA samples from brain, heart, liver, lung,
thymus, ovary and embryo at day 10–12 were purchased
from Ambion (P/N: 7810, 7812, 7814, 7816, 7818, 7824,
7826 and 7968). Ambion’s mouse total RNAs are derived
from Swiss Webster mice. All RNA samples were normalized
based on the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays for human or
mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
endogenous controls (P/N: 4310884E and 4352339E, Applied
Biosystems).
Two cell lines, HepG2 and OP9, were cultured using
Gibco MEM (P/N: 12492–021, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (P/N:
SH30070.01, HyClone, Logan, UT). Trypsinized cells were
counted with a hemocytometer. Approximately 2.8 · 106
suspended cells were pelleted by centrifugation (Allegra 6,
Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 1500 r.p.m. for 5 min,
washed with 1 ml Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
without MgCl2 and CaCl2 (P/N: 14190078, Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA). The cell pellets were re-suspended in 140 ml PBS
and processed with three different sample preparation meth-
ods. With the first method, a 50 ml sample (106 cells) was
mixed with an equal amount of Nucleic Acid Purification
Lysis Solution (P/N: 4305895; Applied Biosystems) by pipet-
ting up and down 10 times, and then spun briefly. The lysate
was diluted 1/10 with 1 U/ml RNase inhibitor solution (P/N:
N8080119; Applied Biosystems) before adding the solution to
an RT reaction. In the second method, a 50 ml sample (106
cells) was used to purify total RNA using the mirVana
miRNA Isolation Kit (P/N: 1560, Ambion, Austin, TX)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified total
RNA was eluted in 100 ml of elution buffer. The third method
involved diluting cells 1/2 with 1· PBS, heating at 95C for 5
min, and immediately chilling on ice before aliquotting dir-
ectly into RT reactions.
miRNA detection using mirVana miRNA
detection kit
Solution hybridization-based miRNA analysis was carried out
using the mirVana miRNA Detection Kit (Cat. #: 1552,
Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA
probes were synthesized by IDT. The radioisotope labeled
RNA fragments were detected and quantitated with a Cyclone
Storage Phosphor System (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA).
Reverse transcriptase reactions
Reverse transcriptase reactions contained RNA samples
including purified total RNA, cell lysate, or heat-treated
cells, 50 nM stem–loop RT primer (P/N: 4365386 and
4365387, Applied Biosystems), 1· RT buffer (P/N:
4319981, Applied Biosystems), 0.25 mM each of dNTPs,
3.33 U/ml MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (P/N: 4319983,
Applied Biosystems) and 0.25 U/ml RNase inhibitor (P/N:
N8080119; Applied Biosystems). The 7.5 ml reactions were
incubated in an Applied Biosystems 9700 Thermocycler in a
96- or 384-well plate for 30 min at 16C, 30 min at 42C, 5 min
at 85C and then held at 4C. All Reverse transcriptase reac-
tions, including no-template controls and RT minus controls,
were run in duplicate.
PCR
Real-time PCR was performed using a standard TaqMan
PCR kit protocol on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence
Detection System (P/N: 4329002, Applied Biosystems). The
10 ml PCR included 0.67 ml RT product, 1· TaqMan Uni-
versal PCR Master Mix (P/N: 4324018, Applied Biosystems),
0.2 mM TaqMan probe, 1.5 mM forward primer and 0.7 mM
reverse primer. The reactions were incubated in a 384-well
plate at 95C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 s
and 60C for 1 min. All reactions were run in triplicate. The
threshold cycle (CT) is defined as the fractional cycle number
at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. TaqMan
CT values were converted into absolute copy numbers using a
standard curve from synthetic lin-4 miRNA.
The method for real-time quantification of pri-miRNA
precursors, let-7a-3 and miR-26b, and pre-miRNA precursor
miR-30a was described elsewhere (34).
RESULTS
We proposed a new real-time RT–PCR scheme for miRNA
quantification (Figure 1). It included two steps: RT and real-
time PCR. First, the stem–loop RT primer is hybridized to a
miRNA molecule and then reverse transcribed with a Multi-
Scribe reverse transcriptase. Next, the RT products are quan-
tified using conventional TaqMan PCR.
Figure 1. Schematic description of TaqMan miRNA assays, TaqMan-based
real-time quantification of miRNAs includes two steps, stem–loop RT and real-
time PCR. Stem–loop RT primers bind to at the 30 portion of miRNA molecules
and are reverse transcribed with reverse transcriptase. Then, the RT product is
quantified using conventional TaqMan PCR that includes miRNA-specific
forward primer, reverse primer and a dye-labeled TaqMan probes. The purpose
of tailed forward primer at 50 is to increase its melting temperature (Tm)
depending on the sequence composition of miRNA molecules.

The dynamic range and sensitivity of the miRNA quanti-
fication scheme were first evaluated using a synthetic cel-lin-4
target. Synthetic RNA was quantified based on the A260 value
and diluted over seven orders of magnitude. The cel-lin-4
TaqMan miRNA assay showed excellent linearity between
the log of target input and CT value, demonstrating that the
assay has a dynamic range of at least 7 logs and is capable of
detecting as few as seven copies in the PCR reaction (Figure 2).
Eight additional miRNA assays were also validated using
mouse lung total RNA. The RNA input ranged from 0.025 to
250 ng (Figure 3). The CT values correlated to the RNA input
(R2 > 0.994) over four orders of magnitude. A negative control
assay, cel-miR-2, did not give a detectable signal, even in
reactions with 250 ng mouse total RNA.
The expression profile of five miRNAs was determined in
seven different mouse tissues to create a miRNA expression
map. The copy number per cell was calculated based on the
input total RNA (assuming 15 pg/cell) and the standard curve
of synthetic lin-4 target. Several interesting observations were
made from this expression map. First, miRNAs are very
abundant, averaging 2390 copies per cell in these tissues.
The level of expression ranged from less than 10 to 32 090
copies per cell. Of the 12 miRNAs, miR-16 and miR-323 were
the most and least abundant miRNAs, respectively, across all
tissues. In addition, each tissue had a distinctive signature of
miRNA expression. The overall level of miRNA expression
was highest in mouse lung and lowest in embryos. Finally, the
dynamic range of miRNA expression varied greatly from less
than 5-fold (let-7a) to more than 2000-fold (miR-323) among
these seven tissues (Table 1).
To assess the need for RNA isolation, we added cell lysates
directly to miRNA assays. The equivalent of 2.5–2500 cells
were added directly to 7.5 ml RT reactions. When detected,
the CT values correlated (R
2 > 0.998) to the number of cells in

Mouse or human total RNA samples from brain, heart, liver, lung, thymus, ovary and embryo (at day 10–12) were purchased from Ambion. Copy number per cell is
estimated based on standard curve of lin-4 synthetic miRNA. A total of 150 ng RNA (or equivalent to approximately 10 000 cells assuming 15 pg of total RNA per cell)
was added to each RT reaction. RNA input was normalized based on TaqMan GAPDH endogenous control (P/N: 4352339E).

The effect of non-specific genomic DNA on TaqMan
miRNA assays was also tested for 12 assays. Results showed
no difference in CT values in the presence or absence of 5 ng of
human genomic DNA added to the RT reactions, suggesting
that the assays are highly specific for RNA targets (data not

directly to miRNA quantification assays. Figure 5 illustrates

RNA, cell lysates and heat-treated cells derived from an equal
number of HepG2 cells. Adding heat-treated cells directly to
the miRNA assays produced the lowest CT values, and good
concordance was observed among all three different sample
preparation methods.
The reproducibility of TaqMan miRNA assays was
examined by performing12 miRNA assays with 16 replicates
performed by two independent operators (data not shown).
The standard deviation of the CTs averaged 0.1, demonstrating
the high precision of the assays.
Solution hybridization-based miRNA northern analysis was
used as an independent technology to compare with TaqMan
miRNA assays (Figure 6). We observed that hybridization-
based miRNA analyses were less reproducible and that con-
cordance with TaqMan assays varied from target to target.
There was a general concordance between the two methods
(R2 ¼ 0.916) for miR-16 across five mouse tissue samples.
However, correlations were relatively low for less abundant
miRNAs, such as miR-30 (R2 ¼ 0.751).
Hybridization methods can lack specificity for the mature
miRNAs. We investigated the ability of the TaqMan miRNA
assays to differentiate between the mature miRNAs and their
longer precursors, using synthetic targets for pri-miRNA pre-
cursors, pri-miR-26b and pri-let-7a and pre-miRNA precursor
pre-miR-30a (Table 2). TaqMan assays designed to detect
either precursors or mature miRNAs were tested with synthetic
targets averaging 1.5 · 108 copies per RT reaction (1.3 · 107
copies per PCR). TaqMan miRNA analyses with only pri-
miRNA precursor molecules produced CT values at least
11 cycles higher than analyses with mature miRNA ones.
This result implies that if mature miRNA and precursor
were at an equal concentration, the latter would contribute
<0.05% background signal to the assay of mature target.
For pre-miR-30a where the mature miRNA miR-30a-3p is
located at the 30 end of the pre-miR-30a sequence, a difference

of 8.4 CT was observed. The results showed that TaqMan
miRNA assays are specific to mature miRNAs. However,
the assay specificity is better if the miRNA is located at the
50 strand of the pre-miRNA precursor. Experiments analyzing
total RNA instead of synthetic targets indicated that the pre-
cursors are at least two orders of magnitude less abundant than
mature miRNAs, based on CT differences of 7 or more for
miR-26b-1 and let-7a-2 precursors. Considered together, these
results suggest that the TaqMan miRNA assays are highly
specific for the mature miRNAs.
The ability of the TaqMan miRNA assays to discriminate
miRNAs that differ by as little as a single nucleotide was tested
with the five synthetic miRNAs of let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d
and let-7e (Figure 7). Each miRNA assay was examined
against each miRNA. Relative detection efficiency was cal-
culated from CT differences between perfectly matched and
mismatched targets, assuming 100% efficiency for the perfect
match. Very low levels of non-specific signal were observed,
ranging from zero to 0.3% for miRNAs with 2–3 mismatched
bases and only 0.1–3.7% for the miRNAs that differed by a
single nucleotide. Most cross-reactions resulted from G–T
mismatches during the RT reaction (let-7a assay versus let-
7c target etc.). Only the targeted miRNA was detected if more
than three mismatched bases between any two miRNAs were
present.
We compared the discrimination ability of the TaqMan
miRNA assays to that of solution-based hybridization analysis
(Figure 8). In our hands, the hybridization method discrimin-
ated well between let-7a and let-7b. However, poor or no
discrimination was observed among let-7a, let-7c and let-
7d, which differ by 1–3 nt.
We speculated that stem–loop primers might provide better
RT efficiency and specificity than linear ones. Base stacking of
the stem might enhance the thermal stability of the RNA–DNA
heteroduplex. Furthermore, spatial constraint of the stem–loop
would likely improve the assay specificity in comparison to
conventional linear RT primers. We compared the sensitivity
and specificity of the stem–loop and linear RT primers using
synthetic miRNAs for let-7a (Figure 9). We observed several
advantages for the stem–loop RT. First, in the presence of the
synthetic let-7a target, the CT values between linear and stem–
loop RT methods differed by 7, indicating that the efficiency of
stem–loop RT was at least 100 times higher. Secondly, stem–
loop RT discriminated better between miRNAs that differ by
two bases based on DCT values. Finally, the stem–loop RT was
at least 100 times better able to discriminate between the
mature miRNA and its precursor, based on the DCT (precursor
versus mature) of 7.
DISCUSSION
Since the discovery of miRNAs, remarkable advances in the
characterization of these gene families have delineated the
mechanism for their functions in gene regulation (35). As a
result, extensive surveys have begun to identify miRNA bio-
markers specific for tissue types or disease status. These stud-
ies will benefit from methods that allow for both accurate
identification and quantification of miRNAs.
Current methods for detection and quantification of miR-
NAs are largely based on cloning, northern blotting (5), or
primer extension (36). Although microarrays could improve
the throughput of miRNA profiling, the method is relatively
limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity (32,33). Low
sensitivity becomes a problem for miRNA quantification
because it is difficult to amplify these short RNA targets.
Furthermore, low specificity may lead to false positive signal

from closely related miRNAs, precursors and genomic
sequences. More recently, a modified Invader assay has
been reported for the quantification of several miRNAs
(37). However, Invader assays have limited specificity and
sensitivity, requiring at least 50 ng total RNA, or 1000
lysed cells, per assay.
Real-time PCR is the gold standard for gene expression
quantification (38,39). It has been a long challenge for scient-
ists to design a conventional PCR assay from miRNAs aver-
aging 22 nt in length. We developed a novel scheme to
design TaqMan PCR assays that specifically quantify
miRNA expression levels with superior performance over
existing conventional detection methods. We have designed
and validated assays for 222 human miRNAs (Chen et al.,
unpublished data). These assays combine the power of PCR
for exquisite sensitivity, real-time monitoring for a large
dynamic range and TaqMan assay reporters to increase the
specificity. In our hands, miRNA precursors were at least 2000
times less effective targets than mature miRNAs (Table 2).
Because these assays are insensitive to precursors or genomic
DNA, we were able to add heat-treated cells directly to the
assays, eliminating the need for sample preparation. For
applications where both mature miRNAs and their precursors
need to be assayed, conventional TaqMan assays can be used
in parallel to specifically detected precursors.
We observed the better specificity and sensitivity of stem–
loop RT primers than conventional linear ones likely due to the
base stacking and spatial constraint of the stem–loop structure
(Figure 9). The base stacking could improve the thermal sta-
bility and extend the effective footprint of RT primer/RNA
duplex that may be required for effective RT from relatively
shorter RT primers. The spatial constraint of the stem–loop
structure may prevent it from binding double-strand genomic
DNA molecules and, therefore, eliminate the need of TaqMan
miRNA assays for RNA sample preparation. Stem–loop
RT primers can potentially be used for multiplex RT reactions
and small RNA cloning for possibly better efficiency and
specificity.
There is an increasing need for sensitive and specific whole
miRNA profiling. The ability to effectively profile miRNAs
could lead to the discoveries of disease- or tissue-specific
miRNA biomarkers, as well as contribute to the understanding
of how miRNAs regulate stem cell differentiation. Our stem–
loop RT–PCR method should provide a practical solution for
these studies. We are currently developing multiplex
approaches that should further increase the utility of this
method.
