ABSTRACT
The RNA import complex (RIC) from the mitochon-
drion of the kinetoplastid protozoan Leishmania
tropica contains two subunits that directly bind to
import signals on two distinct subsets of tRNA and
interact with each other allosterically. What happens
to the tRNA subsequent to its loading on the
complex is unknown. A third subunit—RIC9—has
intrinsic affinity for both types of tRNA and is
essential for import in vivo. Here we show that
antibody against RIC9 inhibited the import of both
types of tRNA into mitoplasts in vitro, but failed to
inhibit the binding of these tRNAs to their respective
receptors, indicating that RIC9 acts in a subsequent
step. Using photoaffinity crosslinking-immunopre-
cipitation to detect translocation intermediates, it
was observed that tRNA was transferred from its
cognate receptor to RIC9, followed by translocation
across the membrane and release as free tRNA in
the inner compartment. Transfer required elevated
temperatures and ATP, but ATP was substituted by
acid pH. These tRNA movements were sensitive to
uncouplers and inhibitors, suggesting distinct roles
of the electrical and chemical components of the
proton motive force generated by vectorial proton
translocation accompanying ATP hydrolysis. By
analysis of partially assembled complexes in
L. tropica depleted of various subunits, and in vitro
assembly assays, RIC9 was shown to make stable
contacts with RIC8A, a tRNA receptor and RIC6, a
membrane-embedded component. The results have
implications for the mechanism of tRNA import.
INTRODUCTION
Import of nucleus-encoded tRNAs into mitochondria
occurs in a large number of species, to compensate for the
evolutionary loss of the corresponding mitochondrial
tRNA genes (1,2). An extreme example is kinetoplastid
protozoa of genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma, in
which the mitochondrial genomes are completely devoid
of tRNA genes, necessitating the large-scale import of
tRNAs from the cytosol to maintain mitochondrial
translation (3,4).
The mechanisms of recognition and translocation of the
hypercharged tRNA molecules of an awkward (L-shaped)
structure across two mitochondrial membranes against
a potential gradient are largely unresolved at present.
Presumably, import of tRNAs from the cytosolic com-
partment, would involve (i) the chaperoning of the tRNA
to import sites on the outer membrane; (ii) recognition
of importable tRNAs, or discrimination against non-
imported species; (iii) translocation though the outer
membrane; (iv) recognition or discrimination at the inner
membrane; (iv) translocation though the inner membrane
into the matrix compartment. Signiﬁcant progress has
been recently achieved by the development of in vitro
import systems from yeast (5), plants (6) and kinetoplastid
protozoa (7–10) and by the application of gene knock-
down protocols to identify import factors. So far, these
studies indicate similarities as well as diﬀerences in the
import mechanism in diﬀerent organisms.
There is general agreement that in all organisms, tRNA
import is mediated by protein factors or complexes on
the mitochondrial membranes, but some in vitro systems
additionally require soluble carrier proteins, while others
do not. Both membrane-bound and soluble factors have
been recently identiﬁed. In Arabidopsis, three diﬀerent
outer membrane-bound tRNA-binding import factors
have been described (11), while in yeast, components of
the inner and outer membrane protein import complexes
have been implicated (12). In the latter system, soluble
carrier proteins (lysyl tRNA synthetase and enolase) are
involved (13,14). A soluble cytosolic tRNA-binding
protein (EF1a) is also required for import into T. brucei
mitochondria in vivo but not in vitro (15). Finally, a
functional import complex of several proteins has been
isolated from L. tropica (see subsequently).
In the L. tropica in vitro import system, as well as in
transiently transfected cells, there is evidence for interac-
tions between two diﬀerent types of importable tRNA at

the inner membrane (16). Type I tRNAs are imported
eﬃciently by themselves, whereas import of type II tRNAs
is stimulated by type I tRNAs; conversely, type II tRNAs
inhibit the import of type I substrates. These two tRNA
types diﬀer in the sequence motifs recognized by the
import apparatus (17), and interact with distinct receptors
(see subsequently). Such allosteric interactions may help
to balance the tRNA pool in the matrix, and must be
adequately accounted for by any proposed import
mechanism.
A combination of biochemical and genetic approaches
is being used to deﬁne components of the inner
membrane-associated import apparatus of L. tropica.
A large (600 kDa) multi-protein complex (the RNA
import complex, or RIC) was isolated from Leishmania
mitochondria and shown to be functional for the
translocation of tRNAs across artiﬁcial (18) or mitochon-
drial (19) membranes. This complex contains several
tRNA-binding proteins and a tRNA-dependent ATPase
(18,20). The genes for the major subunits have been
identiﬁed (21–23). The largest subunit, RIC1, binds type I
tRNAs (21) and is essential for the import of this subset
in vitro (18) as well as in vivo (21). The other tRNA subset
(type II) is recognized by RIC8A (22). Binding of type II
tRNAs to RIC8A is positively regulated by the RIC1–
tRNA complex, while that of type I tRNAs is inhibited by
RIC8A complexed with type II tRNA (18,22). Moreover,
in vivo, downregulation of the type I receptor RIC1 results
in mitochondrial depletion of both type I and type II
tRNAs, whereas import of type I tRNAs is stimulated in
cells depleted of the type II receptor RIC8A (21,22), as
expected from the operation of the allosteric interactions
in vivo.
Not much is known about the events subsequent to the
binding of tRNA to the receptors. All the in vitro import
systems require ATP for translocation. Additionally,
in the L. tropica (24), yeast (12) and plant (6) systems,
a membrane potential is also required (as judged by
sensitivity of import to potential-dissipating protono-
phores), although the L. tarentolae system appears to be
resistant to these inhibitors (10). There is also clear
evidence for the requirement of a membrane potential in
T. Brucei in vivo (15). It is possible that, at least in some
systems, ATP hydrolysis (mediated in L. tropica by RIC1)
results in proton pumping across the membrane, resulting
in a proton gradient that drives import (20).
To better deﬁne the translocation step, we looked for
additional tRNA-binding subunits of the import complex.
One such candidate is RIC9, a major RNA-binding
component of the puriﬁed complex (Chatterjee,S. and
Adhya,S., unpublished data). RIC9 is the smallest
subunit of size 19 kDa. It is encoded by a single gene
with partial structural homology to subunit VI (COXVI)
of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) (23). Antibody
against RIC9 detected the presence of a cross-reactive
19 kDa protein in complex IV (23); since no other
COXVI-related sequence is observed in the Leishmania
genome, this is likely to be a bifunctional protein.
Knockdown of RIC9 by expression of the corresponding
antisense RNA resulted in depletion of mitochondrial
tRNAs and loss of mitochondrial function, suggesting its
involvement in import (23). In this report, we have
examined the role of RIC9 in the translocation of
tRNAs across membranes. The results suggest that
RIC9 acts as a transit stop for tRNAs traveling from
the receptor to the pore, and that this transient interaction
is energized by a proton gradient across the membrane.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning and expression of RIC9 gene
The PCR ampliﬁcation of the RIC9 gene from L. tropica
genomic DNA has been described (23). The complete
gene was inserted into vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham,
Buckinghamshire, UK) and expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21 as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein.
Recombinant RIC9 was cleaved oﬀ the fusion protein
and gel-puriﬁed as described (21). Prior to assay, 200 ml of
the eluate (3 mg/ml protein, in 0.2% w/v SDS, 0.05M
Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1mM EDTA, 5mM DTT, 0.1mg/ml
BSA, 200mM NaCl) was diluted 5-fold in TETN250
buﬀer (250mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 5mM EDTA, 250mM
NaCl, 1%v/v Triton-X-100 and 2mg/ml BSA) and kept
for 2 h on ice in order to refold the protein. The protein
was ﬁnally concentrated by ultraﬁltration to 20 mg/ml
(1 pmol/ml). The ﬁnal detergent concentrations in the
concentrated protein solution are estimated to be 1%
Triton X-100, 0.04% SDS.
Knockdown of RIC9 and other subunits
The RIC9 gene was inserted in the antisense orientation
between the HindIII and BamH1 sites downstream of the
tetracycline-inducible T7 RNA polymerase promoter in
targeting vector pGET (21), to form the recombinant
pGET(RIC9AS). Expression host L. tropica 13–90
was transfected with the recombinant carrying a BLE
(bleomycin-resistant) marker gene, and phleomycin-
resistant colonies were selected. A selected clone was
cultured and induced with 10 mg/ml tetracycline for 2 days,
resulting in antisense synthesis and growth arrest (23).
Mitochondrial analyses were typically carried out on
2 day-induced cultures. Other subunits (RIC6, RIC8A)
were similarly knocked down by induction of the
appropriate antisense RNAs (23).
Preparation of radiolabeled tRNA
Genes encoding Leishmania tRNAArg (ACG), tRNATrp
(CCA), tRNAVal (CAC) and tRNAMet-e (CAU) were
PCR-ampliﬁed from L. tropica strain UR6 genomic DNA
and cloned between the HindIII and BamH1 sites of
vector pGEM4Z (Promega), as described (21). Bam H1-
linearized plasmids were run-oﬀ transcribed in 10 ml
reactions containing 40mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 6mM
MgCl2, 1mM Spermidine, 1mM DTT, 0.5mM each of
CTP, ATP and GTP, 0.01mM UTP, 1 mCi of [a-32P] UTP
and 10 units of T7 RNA polymerase at 378C for 60min.
Each transcript contains a nonanucleotide extension at
the 50-end, derived from the vector polylinker region.
5-Bromouridine (BU)-labeled tRNAs were synthesized
under light-limiting conditions in reactions containing,
1600 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 5
additionally, 20 mM 5-BU triphosphate. Eﬀector RNAs
were similarly synthesized except that the amount of
[a-32P] UTP in the transcription reaction mix was reduced
to one-tenth of the normal, and the UTP concentration
was raised from 10 to 250 mM. tRNAs were puriﬁed by gel
electrophoresis.
Import assay systems
Import was assayed by incubating 32P-labeled tRNAs with
intact L. tropicamitochondria, or mitoplasts, or liposomes
reconstituted with puriﬁed RIC or with mitochondrial
extract from induced or tetracycline-induced cultures,
adding ribonucleases and analyzing the RNAse-resistant
RNA.
Mitoplasts. Mitochondria were prepared by hypotonic
lysis of L. tropica promastigotes followed by Percoll
gradient centrifugation (25). Mitoplasts were obtained by
treating mitochondria with 320 mM digitonin at 48C to
selectively remove the outer membrane (24).
RIC-liposomes. RIC was puriﬁed by aﬃnity chromato-
graphy from inner mitochondrial membrane fractions of
L. tropica (18). Phosphatidyl choline liposomes (50 mg of
lipid in 10 ml of buﬀer DB) were incubated with RIC
(100 ng) for 1 h on ice before import assay.
Knockdown extract reconstituted liposomes. Mitochon-
dria were prepared from 2 108 promastigotes. Crude
mitochondrial fractions (400mg protein) prepared from
uninduced or RIC9 knockdown cells were extracted with
40 ml of BAM buﬀer (50mM Bis Tris–HCl pH 7.0, 0.75M
aminocaproic acid, 2% w/v dodecyl maltoside), diluted
to 200 ml with buﬀer DB (0.2M Tris–HCl pH 7.5,
5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 0.1mM PMSF, 10% v/v
glycerol) and concentrated to 30 ml (protein concentration
13mg/ml) by using a Microcon 10 ultraﬁlter (Amicon).
The ultraﬁltration step also serves to remove excess
detergent (dodecyl maltoside), change the buﬀer to the
glycerol-containing DB (to facilitate subsequent reconsti-
tution). Before reconstitution, recombinant RIC9 (120 ng
in 6 ml, or 20 mg/ml, in 0.2% w/v SDS-containing gel
elution buﬀer) was diluted 5-fold into BAM buﬀer, kept
on ice for 2 h, further diluted to 200 ml with buﬀer DB and
concentrated down to 30 ml by ultraﬁltration. Liposomes
(50 mg of lipid in 10 ml of dialysis buﬀer) were incubated
with mitochondrial extract (8 ml=100 mg protein) with
or without refolded RIC9 (8 ng in 2 ml) for 1 h on ice
before import assay (ﬁnal detergent concentrations:
0.0006% SDS, 0.16% dodecyl maltoside).
RNase protection assay. Mitoplasts or reconstituted lipo-
somes were incubated with 100 fmol of 32P-labeled tRNA
(5 nM) and ATP (4mM) in 20 ml reactions containing
buﬀer BB (10mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 10mM MgCl2,
2mM DTT) for 15min at 378C. RNase A (2.5 mg/ml) and
RNase T1 (50 units/ml) were added, and incubation
continued for an additional 15min at 378C. The RNase-
protected radiolabeled RNA was recovered by guanidium
isothiocyanate extraction and ethanol precipitation and
analyzed by urea-6% w/v PAGE (18).
RNA-binding assays
Mitoplasts were incubated with 32P-labeled tRNA (1 nM)
in the presence of buﬀer BB containing 0.1M KCl on ice
for 30min, washed, and the bound RNA recovered as
above. To perform northwestern analysis, blots of
recombinant RIC9 were probed with radiolabeled
tRNAs (26). Puriﬁed and re-folded RIC9 (1 pmol/ml,
see above) was diluted to 50 fmol/ml in buﬀer DB and
1 ml was incubated with indicated amounts of 32P-labeled
tRNA in buﬀer BB (reaction volume 10 ml, estimated
detergent concentrations: 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.002%
SDS) in the presence of indicated concentrations of KCl
for 30min on ice. Gel-shift assays were performed on
native 5–15% w/v gradient gels (18). Dissociation
constants (Kd) were estimated by Scatchard analysis
(27). Binding of tRNA to liposomes was assayed by
incubating with labeled substrate for 30min at 48C in the
absence of ATP, followed by washing the liposomes and
recovery of the bound RNA.
Photochemical crosslinking and immunoprecipitation
RIC-incorporated liposomes or mitoplasts were incubated
with BU-labeled tRNA (1 nM) for 30min on ice in 20 ml
buﬀer BB containing 0.1M KCl, and washed with cold
buﬀer DB. The tRNA-loaded vesicles were resuspended in
20 ml of BB containing 4mM ATP and incubated at 378C
for the indicated times. For time course reactions, the
reaction for each time-point was diluted out with cold
DB and the vesicles were recovered by centrifugation.
The vesicles were then irradiated with 313 nm UV on a
transilluminator for 30min–1 h with cooling, to form
RNA–protein crosslinks. SDS was then added to a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.2%. For immunoprecipitation, the
crosslinked and dissociated proteins were diluted 20-fold
into TETN250 buﬀer containing a 1 : 50 dilution of
polyclonal mouse antiserum, kept on ice for 1 h and the
protein–antibody complex recovered by precipitation with
Protein-A-Sepharose. Crosslinked complexes or immuno-
precipitates were dissociated in SDS–PAGE sample buﬀer
and resolved by 8M urea-6% w/v PAGE in the presence
of 0.05% w/v SDS.
Analysis of mitochondrial complexes
Mitochondria were extracted with BAM buﬀer as
above, and the extracts (130 mg protein) subjected to
Blue Native (BN) electrophoresis, as described (21).
High molecular complexes were visualized by Coomassie
staining. This was followed by either western blotting
of the resolved complexes, or excision of individual
bands and analysis of their subunit compositions by
SDS–PAGE (21).
In vitro assembly assay
Liposomes (50 mg lipid) were reconstituted in 20 ml of
buﬀer DB with RIC9-knockdown mitochondrial extract
(5mg/ml protein) as described above, in presence or
absence of recombinant RIC9 (0.4mg/ml) for 1 h on ice,
washed and the membrane-associated complexes were
solubilized with BAM buﬀer. The complexes were run
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 5 1601
under native (BN–PAGE) or denaturing (SDS–PAGE)
conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and
probed with indicated antibodies. Where indicated, mouse
polyclonal antiserum (1 : 50) against a speciﬁc subunit was
added before RIC9.
Protein interaction assay
Recombinant subunits (0.2–0.6 mM) were incubated alone
or in combination in 10 ml buﬀer BB for 1 h on ice, then
subjected to native 4–15% gradient PAGE (18), before
Coomassie staining or western blotting.
RESULTS
Depletion of RIC9 results in defective import of both
type I and type II tRNAs
In view of the putative bifunctionality of RIC9, the
depletion of mitochondrial tRNAs in vivo upon down-
regulating RIC9/COX6b could be an indirect consequence
of the loss of the respiratory function of this protein,
leading to depletion of intracellular ATP. It was therefore
pertinent to ask whether the import apparatus was
speciﬁcally aﬀected in any way. The import function of
RIC can be assayed by reconstitution of phospholipid
vesicles (liposomes) with puriﬁed RIC (18) or mitochon-
drial extracts (21), followed by detection of ribonuclease-
resistant radiolabeled tRNA. Control experiments showed
that the import was dependent on the presence of
liposomes as well as the extract in the reconstitution
mix, and dependent on ATP (Figure 1A). When mito-
chondrial extracts from uninduced L. tropica antisense
transformants were assayed in this way, normal import
was observed by RNase protection; in contrast, mito-
chondrial extracts from RIC9-deﬁcient cells were inactive
for import of all the tRNAs tested (Figure 1B). These
included type I (tRNATyr, tRNAArg and tRNATrp) as well
as type II (tRNAIle, tRNAVal and tRNA) tRNAs. Import
was restored by the addition of puriﬁed, bacterially
expressed RIC9 (Figure 1C), but not by unrelated proteins
such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), or other import
factors such as RIC1; RIC9 itself was not able to protect
the tRNA from RNase digestion (Figure 1D). Thus, the
defect in the import apparatus was speciﬁcally caused by
the deﬁciency of RIC9.
tRNA binding activity of isolated RIC9
The Leishmania RIC9 gene was expressed in E. coli, the
recombinant protein puriﬁed and subjected to north-
western analysis using a variety of importable tRNAs as
probes. While unrelated proteins such as BSA did not
react under these conditions (data not shown), strong
signals were obtained with all the tRNAs tested, revealing
a general tRNA-binding property of RIC9 (Figure 2A).
Gel-shift assays using puriﬁed RIC9 revealed a speciﬁc
tRNA–RIC9 complex (Figure 2B). From Scatchard plots
(Figure 2C), the dissociation constant (Kd) of the complex
at 48C in the absence of added monovalent salt was
estimated to be 1.5 nM. The interaction was sensitive to
salt and to the polyanion heparin, and competed out by an
excess of E. coli tRNA (Figure 2D and E). In contrast,
binding of tRNA to the import receptor RIC1 was
insensitive to KCl up to at least 0.1M (Figure 2D).
Thus, the tRNA-binding activity of RIC9 is non-speciﬁc
with respect to tRNA sequence and involves mainly ionic
interactions.
In the complex, RIC9 is not a tRNA receptor but
is required for translocation
Translocation of tRNA through the import channel is
preceded by the binding of the substrate to the appro-
priate receptor in the import complex. The role of RIC9 in
binding and translocation was investigated by immuno-
inhibition experiments with wild-type L. tropica mito-
plasts. In presence of control (non-immune) serum, import
as well as binding of type I tRNATyr were inhibited by low
concentrations of type II tRNAIle; in contrast, import and
binding of tRNAIle were stimulated by tRNATyr. Anti-
RIC9 antibody inhibited the import of type I tRNATyr as
well as that of type II tRNAIle (Figure 3A).
The same antibody failed to inhibit the binding of
tRNATyr to mitoplasts, but in its presence the binding of
tRNATyr was no longer inhibited by tRNAIle (Figure 3B).
Conversely, in presence of anti-RIC9 antibody, the type II

knockdown Leishmania tropica. (A) Import of tRNATyr into lipo-
somes reconstituted with mitochondrial extracts from uninduced
pGET(RIC9AS) transformants of L. tropica 13–90. Indicated combina-
tions of liposomes (50 mg phosphatidylcholine) and mitochondrial
extract (5mg/ml) were incubated together in 20 ml for 1 h at 48C, then
32P-labeled tRNATyr (3.3 nM) and ATP (4mM, as indicated) were
added, and import assayed by RNase protection. (B) Import of the
indicated tRNAs into liposomes reconstituted with mitochondrial
extracts from uninduced (Tet) or RIC9 knockdown (+Tet) cells. In
addition to high speciﬁc activity import substrate (3.3 nM), 0.33 nM of
low speciﬁc activity tRNATyr was present as positive eﬀector for type II
tRNAs in all cases. (C) Liposomes were reconstituted with mitochon-
drial extracts from knockdown cells (KD) in the absence or presence
of recombinant, refolded RIC9 (0.4 mg/ml), before assay of the
indicated tRNAs for import. (D) Liposomes were reconstituted with
knockdown mitochondrial extracts in the absence or presence of RIC9,
BSA or recombinant RIC1 (0.4 mg/ml each), then assayed for import
of tRNATyr, tRY, tRNATyr; tRI, tRNAIle; tRV, tRNAVal; tRW,
tRNATrp; tRR, tRNAArg; tRM, tRNAMet-e.
1602 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 5
tRNAIle was bound in the absence of tRNATyr
(Figure 3B). These results indicate that (i) RIC9 does
not directly bind tRNA in the native complex in the
absence of ATP; (ii) contacts between RIC9 and the two
receptors are altered upon binding of the antibody,
leading to the activation of the type II binding site of
RIC8A and the loss of contact between tRNA-bound
RIC1 and RIC8A and (iii) RIC9 is required for the
translocation step.
ATP-dependent transfer of tRNAs from receptors to RIC9
Although RIC9 in isolation has tRNA-binding activity
(Figure 2), antibody against this subunit was unable to
inhibit tRNA binding to the intact, membrane-bound
complex, but inhibits translocation (Figure 3). This
indicates either that the tRNA-binding activity of RIC9
is not utilized during import, or that the binding of tRNA
to RIC9 in the import complex follows the initial receptor-
binding step but precedes the actual translocation. To
investigate these possibilities, radiolabeled tRNA contain-
ing the photoactivable analog 5-BU was incubated with
mitoplasts, or with proteoliposomes reconstituted with
puriﬁed RIC, under conditions favoring binding or
translocation, then crosslinked to the complex, which
was subsequently dissociated to its constituent subunits,
and the subunit crosslinked to tRNA identiﬁed by
immunoprecipitation with subunit-speciﬁc antibody
(Figure 4A). The initial tRNA-binding step occurs at
48C in the absence of ATP, and under these conditions
tRNATyr crosslinks speciﬁcally to RIC1 (18).
In an initial experiment, tRNATyr, double-labeled with
32P and BU, was incubated with mitoplasts at 48C in
absence of ATP; excess unbound label was washed oﬀ; the
bound RNA was photocrosslinked to mitoplast protein;
and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) was analyzed by gel
electrophoresis. A discrete RNP (designated as RNP-I)
was observed, migrating slower than the uncrosslinked
RNA (Figure 4A). If, after the initial binding at 48C,
followed by washing oﬀ excess label, the incubation
temperature was raised to 378C, there was no change in
the mobility of the RNP. To identify the RIC subunit
crosslinked to the tRNA, the liposome-bound RIC was
dissociated after UV-irradiation, and the RNP immuno-
precipitated with subunit-speciﬁc antibody (Figure 4C).
The RNP of lower mobility formed at 378C in the absence
of ATP was precipitated by anti-RIC1 antibody, as
previously observed for the complex formed at 48C (18),
but not by anti-RIC9 (Figure 4C, left). This conﬁrms that
RIC9 is not the initial tRNA-binding site in the complex
(see above).
On addition of ATP at 378C, the mobility of the RNP
was increased (RNP-TI; Figure 4B). RNP-TI was pulled
down by anti-RIC9 but not by anti-RIC1 (Figure 4C,
right). The same result was obtained with intact mito-
plasts instead of RIC-proteoliposomes (data not
shown). Formation of the tRNA: RIC9 complex required
hydrolysis of ATP, since the non-hydrolyzable analog
bg-methylene ATP could not substitute for ATP
(Figure 4B). This experiment demonstrates that tRNA is
transferred from RIC1 to RIC9 upon ATP hydrolysis.
tRNATyr is a Type I tRNA that, through interaction
with RIC1, promotes the binding of Type II tRNAs to
their cognate receptor, RIC8A (18,22). To examine the
movement of Type II tRNAs subsequent to receptor
binding, BU-labeled tRNAIle (Type II) was loaded on
to the complex in presence of tRNATyr eﬀector, then
incubated under diﬀerent conditions as above, before

speciﬁc activity tRNATyr (upper panels) or tRNAIle (lower panels) in
the absence or presence of low speciﬁc activity eﬀector (0.5 nM) as
indicated, and assayed for import by RNase protection. (B) Mitoplasts,
pre-incubated as above, were incubated in binding buﬀer containing
0.1M KCl with indicated combinations of substrate (1 nM) and eﬀector
(0.1 nM) in the absence of ATP for 30min at 48C, then washed and the
bound RNA recovered.

crosslinking. In the absence of ATP, the crosslinked
complex (RNP-II) was immunoprecipitated by anti-
RIC8A antibody, as expected (Figure 4D, left). In the
presence of ATP, a complex (RNP-TII) of about the same
mobility as RNP-II was formed, but this was speciﬁcally
precipitated by anti-RIC9, but not by anti-RIC8A anti-
body (Figure 4D, right). Thus, both tRNA types are
transferred from their cognate receptors to RIC9.
Stepwise movements of tRNA in presence of ATP
To examine the kinetics of transfer of tRNA from the
receptor to RIC9, the BU-labeled tRNATyr-RIC complex
on liposomes was incubated for diﬀerent times at 378C
in presence of ATP, then UV-crosslinked and the RNA
adduct analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Figure 5A).
Between 0 and 10min, there was a progressive reduction
in the receptor complex RNP-I. The amount of the RIC9
complex (RNP-TI) increased to a peak at 4min, and
then declined. Between 7 and 15min, the formation of a
species migrating as free tRNA was observed (Figure 5A).
The locations of the free and bound tRNA on the
liposomes were determined by their RNase sensitivity
following the crosslinking step. The RNP-TI complex (as
well as the RNP-I complex; data not shown) formed at
early and intermediate incubation times was RNase
sensitive (Figure 5B), indicating their location of the
liposome surface. In contrast, the free tRNA formed at
later times was resistant to RNase, but became sensitive
upon disruption of the liposomes with detergent
(Figure 5B), and therefore represents imported tRNA.
Thus, in the presence of ATP, the tRNA is ﬁrst transferred
from the receptor to RIC9 on the membrane surface,
and this is followed by its translocation through
the membrane.
H+-dependent transfer of tRNA to RIC9
Vectorial membrane-bound ATPases such as the vacuolar
ATPase and the F1 ATPase (the ATP synthase acting
hydrolytically) act as ATP-driven proton pumps (28).
We have previously shown that tRNA-dependent ATP
hydrolysis by RIC generates a proton gradient across the
phospholipid membrane that is sensitive to protonophores
and ionophores, and that acidiﬁcation of the medium
results in import in the absence of ATP, implying the
Figure 4. ATP-induced transfer of tRNA from import receptors to RIC9.
(A) Crosslinking protocol. Liposomes were incubated with puriﬁed RIC
(25mg/ml) for 1 h at 48C, then incubated with 1 nM of 32P- and BU-
labeled tRNATyr at 48C. The resultant tRNA-loaded vesicles were
transferred to 378C in the presence of 4mM ATP, then UV-irradiated.
(B) RIC-liposomes (25 mg/ml) were incubated with 1 nM of BU-labeled
tRNATyr at 48C for 30min, followed by transfer to 378C for 5min in the
presence or absence of 4mM of ATP or AMPPCP as indicated. The
reactions were then UV-irradiated and the crosslinked products analyzed
by urea–PAGE. (C) RIC-liposomes were incubated with BU-labeled
tRNATyr as above, followed by transfer to 378C in the presence of 4mM
ATP. The resulting complex was UV-irradiated and the crosslinked
adduct was immunoprecipitated with anti-RIC9 or anti-RIC1 serum
(1 : 50). (D) RIC-liposomes were incubated as above (panel C) with 1 nM
of BU-labeled tRNAIle. Low speciﬁc activity eﬀector tRNATyr (0.1 nM)
was present as indicated. The crosslinked adducts were immunoprecipi-

prior to RNase digestion.

proton gradient as the major driving force (20). Complex-
bound RIC1 carries out this reaction (29).
Thus, it was of interest to determine the role of protons
in the stepwise transfer of tRNA from the receptor to
the import pore. The tRNATyr–RIC complex, bound to
liposomes, was incubated at 378C for 10min at diﬀerent
pH values in the absence of ATP, then UV-crosslinked
and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as before. Between
pH 7.0 and 7.5, the tRNA remained bound to RIC1 (as
RNP-I), but further lowering of the pH to 6 resulted in
transfer to RIC9 (RNP-TI) and release as free imported
tRNA (Figure 6A), mimicking the situation with ATP at
neutral pH. Thus, protons eﬀectively substitute for ATP
as the energy source for translocation.
In the presence of the protonophore uncoupler CCCP,
which dissipates the gradient by equilibrating protons
across the membrane, ATP-dependent translocation of
tRNA from RIC1 to RIC9 was abolished (Figure 6B). The
same step was inhibited by oligomycin (Figure 6B), which
does not inhibit RIC1-dependent ATPase but blocks
proton-driven import (20), presumably by inhibiting back-
ﬂow of protons. These observations indicate the crucial
role of protons generated by ATP hydrolysis in tRNA
translocation.
Separate roles of the chemical and electrical components
of the proton motive force
The electromotive force generated by vectorial transport
of protons [the proton motive force (PMF)] is the sum of
chemical (pH) and electrical (c) components. The role
of these two components can be assessed by the use of
ionophores that selectively dissipate either pH or c.
In the presence of valinomycin and K+, which neutralizes
c by equilibrating K+ across the membrane, the tRNA
was transferred from RIC1 to RIC9, but failed to
translocate across the pore as free intra-vesicle tRNA
(Figure 6C). K+ alone had no eﬀect (data not shown). In
contrast, nigericin that carries out electroneutral exchange
of H+ with K+ (30), and therefore speciﬁcally aﬀects
pH, inhibited the transfer of tRNA from RIC1 to RIC9
(Figure 6C). Thus, protons are required to move the
tRNA from one protein to another of the membrane
surface, whereas the electrical potential drives the tRNA
across the membrane.
RIC9 contacts both membrane-embedded and receptor
subunits within the import complex
The structure of the RIC is currently unknown. However,
transient and stable interactions between the subunits can
be revealed by a combination of biochemical and genetic
methods. One approach is based on the prediction that the
subunits are assembled in an ordered manner. Therefore,
knockdown of a given subunit (X) will result in the
accumulation of a partially assembled RIC sub-complex
containing all the subunits assembled up to X in the
assembly pathway, but lacking X as well as all subunits
assembled after X. Moreover, addition of puriﬁed X to
an extract from X-knockdown cells will result in the
formation of a complex containing X as well as the other
missing subunits.
Intracellular RIC9 was depleted by inducible antisense-
mediated knockdown of the corresponding mRNA (23).
Inner membrane macromolecular complexes in mitochon-
drial extracts from the growth-arrested cells were resolved
by BN electrophoresis (21). As shown previously (21),
wild-type cells have four high molecular weight
complexes—complex III (ubiquinol cytochrome c reduc-
tase), complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), complex V
(F1Fo ATP synthase) and RIC (Figure 7A). Knockdown
of RIC9 resulted in the disappearance of complexes III
and IV, and the formation of a smaller complex V (V9)
lacking the mitochondrion-encoded subunit A6 (data not
shown). In normal cells, RIC contains 11 major subunits,
including the single copy type I receptor RIC1, two copies
of the type II receptor RIC8A and three copies each of
RIC6 and RIC9 (23; Figure 7B and F) In RIC9 knock-
down cells, a subcomplex of RIC (RIC9) was observed,
which, on subunit analysis by second-dimension SDS–
PAGE, was found to lack subunits 9, 8A and 3 (all
nucleus-encoded) as well as the mitochondrion-encoded
subunits 2, 4B and 7 (Figure 7B). The absence of
organelle-encoded subunits is a general feature of the
Figure 6. Role of protons in tRNA translocation. (A) RIC-liposomes
(25 mg/ml) were washed and incubated in buﬀers of indicated pH in
the absence or presence of 4mM ATP, with 1 nM of BU-labeled
tRNA. The vesicles containing the bound RNAs were then transferred
to 378C for 10min and then UV crosslinked. (B) BU-labeled tRNATyr
was bound to RIC-liposomes which had been pre-incubated with
50 mM of either m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (CCCP)
or oligomycin, and incubated at 378C in the presence of 4mM ATP
for 2 or 10min. (C) Eﬀect of valinomycin (50 mM) plus 50mM

knockdown of essential import subunits (such as RIC6
and RIC8A; Figure 7B), which leads to depletion of the
intramitochondrial tRNA pool, and consequently, to the
inhibition of organellar protein synthesis. The lack of
subunits 8A and 3 in RIC9 indicates that these subunits
are assembled after RIC9.
A comparative analysis of the subunit compositions of
partially assembled sub-complexes in cells depleted for
various subunits showed that RIC9 was identical to
RIC6 (the sub-complex in RIC6-depleted cells) except
that the former contained RIC6 (Figure 7B). Similarly,
RIC8A contained all the subunits of RIC9 and
additionally, RIC9 (Figure 7B). These results indicate
that the subunits are assembled in the following order:
RIC6+6!RIC9+9!RIC8A+8A!RIC3
(Figure 7G).
To study the interaction between RIC9 and other
subunits of the import complex, the RIC9–knockdown
complex was incubated with liposomes in the presence of
recombinant RIC9. The washed liposomes were then
analyzed for the presence of RIC9 by western blot. This
showed the presence of RIC9 in the membrane-bound

RIC8A (D) antiserum. (E) Interaction between RIC6 and RIC9 at the membrane. Recombinant RIC6 (0.2 mM) and RIC9 (0.2–0.6 mM) were

complex (Figure 7C). To identify the subunit in the pre-
assembled sub-complex RIC9 that directly interacts with
RIC9, the reconstitution reaction was carried out after
pre-incubating the liposome-bound RIC9 with anti-
bodies against the other subunits. Antibody against
RIC6 inhibited the binding of RIC9 to the complex, as
shown by western blot analysis (Figure 7C). In contrast,
antibodies against other subunits, e.g. RIC1, did not
prevent assembly of RIC9 (Figure 7C), indicating
speciﬁcity of the immuno-inhibition. Both antibodies
were bound to the complex, as indicated by a gel-shift
assay (data not shown). These results illustrate the direct
interaction between RIC6 and RIC9.
In a similar experiment, the assembly of recombinant
RIC8A to the RIC9–knockdown complex was assayed
in the presence of antibodies against various RIC
subunits. Western analysis of the liposome-bound com-
plex showed that RIC8A assembly was speciﬁcally
inhibited by anti-RIC9 antibody (as well as, expectedly,
by the self, i.e. anti-RIC8A, antibody (Figure 7D). In
summary, these immuno-inhibition experiments conﬁrm
the direct, stable interactions between RIC9 and subunits
6 and 8A during assembly of the complex.
RIC6, identical to the iron sulfur protein (ISP) subunit
of complex III, is essential for import, and is present in the
stoichiometry of 3mol/mol of RIC (23); the stoichiometry
is identical to that of RIC9. A long hydrophobic a-helix in
the modeled structure of RIC6 suggests the possibility of
membrane insertion. This was tested by incubating the
puriﬁed subunit with liposomes, separating the liposomes
by centrifugation, solubilizing the bound proteins and
separating them by native gel electrophoresis. It was
observed that RIC6 alone, but not RIC9, was bound to
liposomes (Figure 7E). In the presence of both subunits,
a larger membrane-bound heterodimer was observed,
containing RIC6 as well as RIC9 in a roughly 1 : 1 ratio,
as shown by western blotting, and the pattern was not
altered by titrating with RIC9 (Figure 7E). Thus, the two
subunits interact to form stable membrane-associated
heterodimers, but further polymerization of the hetero-
dimers was not observed; this would presumably require
one or more additional RIC subunits.
DISCUSSION
In this report, we present evidence that RIC9, the 19 kDa
subunit of Leishmania RIC is involved in the translocation
of several tRNAs from import receptors through the
import pore. (i) RIC9 is an RNA-binding protein with no
speciﬁcity for tRNA sequence. (ii) tRNA binding by RIC9
involves reversible ionic interactions, as expected of a
transport factor interacting transiently with the import
substrate. (iii) Antibody against RIC9 inhibits transloca-
tion but not binding of tRNA. (iv) Energy-driven move-
ment of tRNA from the receptor to RIC9, followed by
delivery to the pore, was observed.
RIC9, and a second subunit, RIC6, are each present
in the mole ratio of 3 per complex (13). Experiments on
the assembly of RIC showed that RIC6 is tethered to the
membrane, where it directly interacts with RIC9, and that
RIC9 in turn contacts the type II receptor RIC8A
(Figure 7). A reasonable hypothesis is that RIC9 and
RIC6 form a hexameric complex that functions in
translocation, with RIC9 transferring tRNAs from
receptors to the channel constituted by RIC6. Although
both the transfer subunit and the channel are activated by
the PMF, RIC9 is unlikely to be an integral part of the
transmembrane channel, since the RNA bound to it is
sensitive to RNAse (Figure 5) and is therefore, exposed to
the exterior of the vesicles. The tRNA is released directly
from RIC9 into the membrane interior in the free form,
since we could not detect any other crosslinked RNP
complex prior to the appearance of imported tRNA
(Figure 5); however, transient interactions with RIC6 or
some other subunit cannot be excluded at this time.
RIC9 is encoded by a single Leishmania gene homo-
logous to COX6b, and is shared by RIC and Complex IV.
Thus, in common with RIC1 (21) and RIC8A (22), it
appears to be a bi-functional protein with both oxidative
phosphorylation and tRNA import activity. A second
common feature of these three import components is the
presence of an extra domain, or extension, which appears
to confer upon the protein an import-related activity. In
case of RIC1 (21) and RIC9 (23), a C-terminal extension
is present, while the additional domain of RIC8A is at the
N-terminus (22). Thus, RIC9 is a further example of
evolution of bi-functionalism by domain addition.
The plant and protozoal tRNA import systems share
a number of common features such as the involvement
of membrane-bound proteins, and the requirement of a
trans-membrane potential (1,2). The protozoal RIC9/
COX6b is closely related to COX6b from higher plants
(23). In Arabidopsis and rice, multiple COX6b genes have
been found, which code for long and short versions of the
protein (31). The function of the long gene is unknown; it
may have been created during evolution by exon addition
to the short gene. The long gene from plants resembles
Leishmania RIC9/COX6b in having an extra domain or
extension (at the N-terminus).
In potato mitochondria, the voltage-dependent anion-
selective channel (VDAC) is required for tRNA import
(11). VDAC in the isolated state binds tRNA, but in intact
mitochondria or in the import complex, the tRNA-binding
site is not exposed, since antibodies do not inhibit receptor
binding but aﬀect translocation (11). Functionally, these
properties resemble those of RIC9, but no sequence
similarities between the two proteins are apparent; this
may be an example of diﬀerent proteins having undergone
convergent evolution to a tRNA transfer factor.
The tRNA-binding property of recombinant RIC9 is
diﬀerent from that of the previously described import
receptors for type I and type II tRNAs (21,22). RIC9
binds both types of tRNA, and binding is sensitive to salt
as well as polyanions (Figure 2). In contrast, binding of
tRNAs to the import receptors is sequence/structure
speciﬁc, and insensitive to agents that disrupt ionic inter-
actions. These observations, made with puriﬁed recombi-
nant proteins, recall our earlier results with isolated
mitochondria showing that import, but not binding,
of RNA is salt- and heparin-sensitive (7). In fact, the
dose–response curves of RIC9 binding and import with
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 5 1607
respect to salt and heparin are very similar: monovalent
salt inhibits above 0.1M while heparin inhibits at
10–50mg/ml.
The present photocrosslinking studies, coupled with the
use of inhibitors, show that RIC9-mediated movements of
tRNA from import receptors to and through the import
pore are sensitive to protonophores, and that acidiﬁcation
substitutes for ATP in the process (Figure 6). Thus,
translocation is powered by the PMF generated by
hydrolysis of ATP. The contrasting eﬀects of valinomycin
and nigericin (Figure 6), which alter diﬀerent components
of the PMF, further suggest that the PMF acts in two
ways: protons move the tRNA from the receptor to RIC9,
while the tRNA is released from RIC9 into the pore by the
membrane potential.
The chemical requirement of protons for the ﬁrst step
suggests protonation of one or more critical residues on
the RNA or one of the proteins. Since the transfer from
RIC1 to RIC9 is completed within the narrow pH range
of 7–6 (Figure 6), it is unlikely that protonation of
the phosphate groups of the RNA (pKa  1–2) or
carboxylate groups of the protein (pKa  5) are involved.
On the other hand, histidine residues (pKa  7 for the
imidazole group) are the only protein side chains that
would be protonated in this pH range. Hydrogen bonding
between histidine residues and speciﬁc RNA bases would
thus be aﬀected by changes in pH, leading to either
destabilization of the RIC1–tRNA complex or stabiliza-
tion of the RIC9–tRNA complex. RIC1 is a bifunctional
form of the a subunit of F1Fo ATP synthase with a
C-terminal extension that is involved in tRNA binding
(21). The C-terminal 100-residue region contains four of
the nine histidine residues of this 574-amino acid protein;
the involvement of these residues remains to be tested.
The movement of tRNA from RIC9 through the
membrane pore requires the membrane potential (c)
established by proton pumping. According to the Nernst
equation (32), a pH gradient between 6 and 7 (a 10-fold
concentration gradient) would generate a c of 60mV,
negative inside. Thus the pore is likely to be voltage-gated.
It is interesting to note that RIC6, the putative pore
component (see above), is a Fe-S protein (23); whether the
paramagnetic Fe2+ ions sense voltage is a possibility
worth investigating.
