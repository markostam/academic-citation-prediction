An Information Flow Model for Conflict and 
Fission in Small Groups1 
WAYNE W. ZACHARY 
Data from a voluntary association are used to construct a new formal model for a traditional 
anthropological problem, fission in small groups. The process leading to fission is viewed as 
an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow 
is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each 
relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the 
formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in 
fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership 
in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential 
for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential 
information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate 
the same predictions. 
T H E P R O B L E M OF H O W and why fission takes place in small 
bounded groups has long been a central issue in social anthropology, 
even though the small groups studied have often been described under 
some other rubric, such as kinship. Fission in kinship groups has been 
studied from a variety of perspectives, especially those of descent theory 
(e.g. Evans-Pritchard 1940; Middleton and Tait 1958; Peters 1960; 
Forde 1964), and ecological adaptation (e.g. Reay 1967; Kelly 1968; 
Rappaport 1969; Nelson 1971). Another type of small bounded group 
frequently studied by anthropologists is the voluntary association (e.g. 
Mangin 1965, 1970; Doughty 1970, Goode 1970), although seldom with 
regard to fission or faction formation. In this paper I present data from 
such a group, a university-based karate club, in which a factional 
division led to a formal separation of the club into two organizations. 
The process leading to this fission is analyzed using a new model of 
fission, based on a social network approach. This model is a formal one, 
taken from the family of mathematical structures known as capacitated 
networks, and was developed directly from the ethnographic material 
outlined in the following section. The model allows the locus of fission 
within the group to be accurately predicted (greater than 97% accuracy 
for the data reported here). Moreover, this result is not limited to 
voluntary associations or to American culture, but rather is applicable

to bounded social groups of all types in all settings. Also, the data 
required can be collected by a reliable method currently familiar to 
anthropologists, the use of nominal scales. 
THE ETHNOGRAPHIC RATIONALE 
The karate club was observed for a period of three years, from 1970 
to 1972. In addition to direct observation, the history of the club prior to 
the period of the study was reconstructed through informants and club 
records in the university archives. During the period of observation, the 
club maintained between 50 and 100 members, and its activities 
included social affairs (parties, dances, banquets, etc.) as well as 
regularly scheduled karate lessons. The political organization of the 
club was informal, and while there was a constitution and four officers, 
most decisions were made by concensus at club meetings. For its classes, 
the club employed a part-time karate instructor, who will be referred to 
as Mr. Hi.2 
At the beginning of the study there was an incipient conflict 
between the club president, J o h n A., and Mr. Hi over the price of 
karate lessons. Mr. Hi, who wished to raise prices, claimed the authority 
to set his own lesson fees, since he was the instructor. John A., who 
wished to stabilize prices, claimed the authority to set the lesson fees 
since he was the club's chief administrator. 
As time passed the entire club became divided over this issue, and 
the conflict became translated into ideological terms by most club 
members. The supporters of Mr. Hi saw him as a fatherly figure who 
was their spiritual and physical mentor, and who was only trying to 
meet his own physical needs after seeing to theirs. The supporters of 
John A. and the other officers saw Mr. Hi as a paid employee who was 
trying to coerce his way into a higher salary. After a series of 
increasingly sharp factional confrontations over the price of lessons, the 
officers, led by John A., fired Mr. Hi for at tempting to raise lesson prices 
unilaterally. The supporters of Mr. Hi retaliated by resigning and 
forming a new organization headed by Mr. Hi, thus completing the 
fission of the club. 
During the factional confrontations which preceded the fission, the 
club meeting remained the setting for decision making. If, at a given 
meeting, one faction held a majority, it would at tempt to pass 
resolutions and decisions favorable to its ideological position. The other 
faction would then retaliate at a future meeting when it held the 
majority, by repealing the unfavorable decisions and substituting ones

favorable to itself. Thus, the outcome of any crisis was determined by 
which faction was able to "stack" the meetings most successfully. 
The factions were merely ideological groupings, however, and were 
never organiztionally crystallized. There was an overt sentiment in the 
club that there was no political division, and the factions were not 
named or even recognized to exist by club members. Rather, they were 
merely groups which emerged from the existing network of friendship 
among club members at times of political crisis because of ideological 
differences. There was no a t tempt by anyone to organize or direct 
political strategies of the groups, and, in general, there was no barrier to 
interaction between members of opposing factions. Only at times of 
direct political conflict did individuals selectively interact with others 
who shared the same ideological position, to the exclusion of those 
holding other positions. This selective association during confrontations 
is what brought the factions together only at crisis moments. 
Political crisis, then, also had the effect of strengthening the 
friendship bonds within these ideological groups, and weakening the 
bonds between them, by the pattern of selective reinforcement. A series 
of political crises, like that which preceded the fission had the effect of 
"pull ing" apart the network of friendship ties which held the club 
together, until the group completely and formally separated. 
There are several reasons for formalizing this ethnographic descrip-
tion of the fission process into a mathematical model. First, the 
description is clarified. The formalization of the data necessary for the 
construction of a mathematical model requires that the intuitively 
based description be made precise and that all the relationships among 
descriptive categories be made clear. Second, the intuitive conclusions 
drawn can be formally stated and included in the model. The case 
study can then be generalized on the basis of the formal properties of 
these conclusions. In particular, the conclusions drawn about this group 
force a rejection of a standard anthropological social network model and 
require the construction of a more powerful network modelâ€”a network 
flow model. This model is new to anthropology and suggests several 
important new avenues of investigation in small-group studies. Third, 
hypotheses about the fission process, intuited from observation of the 
club, may be rigorously stated within the terms of the model and 
mathematically tested. Alternatively, assumptions about the basic 
conditions of the political process could be stated and then simulated 
within the model to assess their validity. Only the former approach will 
be used here, however. 
The model is constructed by formalizing those relationships, or 
those components of the system, believed to be the most significant or 
the most explanatory. The feature of the karate club that appeared most 
CONFLICT AND FISSION IN SMALL GROUPS 455 
important in the ethnographic data was the network of friendship 
relationships among club members. While only (affective) friendship is 
considered here, any other dyadic relationship, such as effective 
friendship, patron-client relationships, or kinship ties, could have been 
used to specify the model. This flexibility gives the model a great 
generality. 
A formal model of the friendship network within the club, one that 
contains sufficient complexity and precision to allow the testing of 
propositions about the political activities and the fission process, can be 
constructed. The model-building process will begin from the point of 
the social network model, an intuitive, nonformal model which can 
easily be transformed into a mathematical one. 
SOCIAL NETWORKS 
The idea of the social network model is now well-established in the 
social science literature (Barnes 1968; Wolfe and Whitten 1974; Bott 
1971; and Mitchell 1969), and is thus familiar to most anthropologists. 
In a social network model, the social relationships among the individ-
uals in some bounded group are represented by a graph. Each 
individual in the group is represented by a point on the graph, with a 
line (called an edge) being drawn between any two points on the graph 
if, and only if, the relationship under consideration exists between the 
corresponding individuals. The analysis of patterns of social relationship 
in the group is then conducted on the graph, which is merely a 
shorthand representation of the ethnographic data. Barnes (1969), for 
example, has programmatically suggested the investigation of such 
features as the density (the ratios of actual to possible edges in the 
graph) or the average length of closed circuits in the graph. 
An alternative, more formal, representation of the social network is 
as a square matrix of ones and zeroes. In this form, each individual is 
represented by a row and column in the matrix; for example, the ith 
individual being represented by the ith row and the ith column. For 
each cell in the matrix, a one is assigned to it if, and only if, an edge was 
drawn between the points corresponding to the row and column 
designating that cell. A zero is assigned otherwise. The matrix can then 
be manipulated by matrix algebraic procedures to uncover formal 
relationships which are not superficially evident in the data. Examples 
of techniques for using the matrix form to analyze the structure of social 
relationships are presented in Flament (1963), Holland and Leinhardt 
(1970), and Lorraine and White (1971). 
Both the graph and the matrix representations can be constructed 
for the karate club. The graph representation of the relationships in the 
club (shortly before the fission) is given in Figure 1. A edge is drawn if

an edge. 
two individuals consistently were observed to interact outside the 
normal activities of the club (karate classes and club meetings). Tha t is, 
an edge is drawn if the individuals could be said to be friends outside 
the club activities. This graph is represented as a matrix in Figure 2. All 
the edges in Figure 1 are nondirectional (they represent interaction in both 
directions), and the graph is said to be symmetrical. It is also possible to 
draw edges that are directed (representing one-way relationships); such

This is the matrix representation of the graph shown in Figure 1. The rows and col-
umns represent individuals in the club. An entry, determined by a row/column pair, 
is valued at 1 if an edge was drawn in Figure 1 between the two individuals repre-
sented by the row and column. The entry is valued at 0 otherwise. For example, the 
entry in the fifth row, seventh column, is a 1, indicating there is an edge existing be-
tween individuals 5 and 7. Notice that the matrix is symmetrical--i.e., the seventh 
row fifth column is also valued at 1, since it identifies the same edge. Because, by 
definition, no individual can interact with himself, zeroes occupy the main diagonal 
(from row/column 1 to row/column 34). Later, this matrix will be referred to by the 
symbol E. 
458 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
graphs are called asymmetrical. However, only symmetrical networks will 
be considered in this paper. 
Only 34 individuals are presented in Figures 1 and 2. Although club 
membership was near 60 at that time, none of the 26 members not 
represented interacted with other club members outside the context of 
meetings and classes. Because these individuals would only be uncon-
nected points in the graph, and rows and columns of zeroes in the 
matrix, they are not included. These individuals belonged to neither 
faction, and did not participate in the politics of the club. Most joined 
neither club at the time of the fission, preferring to quit the study of 
karate altogether because of the political conflict. 
Density analysis, or the various forms of matrix analysis, are not 
conducted here because they, like all social network analyses, are static. 
Lorraine and White (1971) have pointed out that an analysis of the 
relationships between edges in the network is the only kind of analysis 
possible on graph and matrix representations. Such an analysis is purely 
structural (by the classic Jacobsonian definition) and must ignore all 
processual aspects of the social activity represented by the network. 
Since the political process leading to the fission rather than the political 
structure of the group is the focus of this paper, neither the graph nor 
the matrix representation is adequate. However, further information 
can be included along with the matrix form to make a processual 
analysis possible. 
CAPICITATED NETWORKS 
In constructing a processual model, the network shown in Figures 1 
and 2 must be considered only as it represents the social constraints of 
the system within which the political process operates. The model built 
here is based on the friendship structure within the club, and the 
feature of the political process which operated through these friendship 
relations was the transmission of political information (both tactical, 
e.g., when a meeting would occur, and ideological) during times of 
political crisis. This process brought the factions into existence during 
crisis periods, and was the mechanism for the positive feedback 
relationship which existed between crisis and factional organization. In 
this relationship, crises caused the reinforcement of only those relation-
ships within factions, thus making the factions more defined, and also 
making another confrontation more likely. 
From the point of view of information flow, the ties in the network 
can be thought of as channels across which information may flow. The 
absence of an edge precludes any direct passage of political information 
between the two individuals represented by the potential edge. It is 
obvious that the flow, or potential for flow, is not identical across all 
CONFLICT AND FISSION IN SMALL GROUPS 459 
edges in the network. Some individuals are much closer friends than 
others, some see each other only in the presence of members of the other 
factions. All these differing relationships are represented in the same 
way in Figures 1 and 2. In order to represent the network accurately as a 
net of channels for information flow, the different potentials for 
information flow of the different edges in the network must be 
quantified and included in the model. 
By quantifying the strengths/weaknesses of the edges in the network, 
a mathematical model can be specified that is formally adequate for the 
investigation of information flow in the karate club, and its effect on the 
fission process. The matrix representation of the social network shown in 
Figures 1 and 2 will be retained as one component of this model. The 
matrix form is chosen because of its greater ease of algebraic manipula-
tion. The matrix in Figure 2 will be referred to as the existence matrix, 
and all entries of value one will be referred to as existing edges in the 
network. A second matrix must be created which quantifies the relative 
strengths/weaknesses of the existing edges in the network. This second 
matrix is called the capacity matrix. 
The complete mathematical model of the karate club can now be 
specified as an ordered triplet (V,E,C), where V is the set of individuals 
included in the network, E is an existence matrix, and C is a capacity 
matrix. The elements of set V are called nodes in the network, and the 
triplet (V,E,C) is called a capacitated network. The mathematical 
development of capacitated networks is presented in Ford and Fulker-
son (1962), Hu (1969), Maki and Thompson (1974), and Zachary 
(1977). 
Each value of the matrix C can be interpreted as representing a 
"capacity" or "value" of maximum possible flow for the corresponding 
edge in the existence matrix E. It can be shown mathematically that 
most features of flow in networks, (in this case flow of political 
information) are functions of the edge capacities in the network (see 
Ford and Fulkerson 1962, or Zachary 1977). In particular, the maxi-
mum flow in the network is completely determined by the values in the 
matrix of edge capacities. 
Unfortunately, there is no way known to quantify what has been 
referred to as "political information," and by extension, there is no sure 
way to specify actual capacities of information flow for the edges in the 
network. However, by making certain assumptions about the social 
settings in which information was communicated, this problem can be 
circumvented. 
Political information was communicated in contexts outside the 
regular activities of the club, and club members interacted in a number 
of such contexts. Since political activity was not overtly recognized by 
460 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
club members, the transmission of political information was then 
incidental to normal social interaction. It can be assumed that the 
amount of information transmitted was related to the number of 
contexts in which the information might have been communicated. 
Mathematically, this can be stated as assuming that the amount of 
information communicated is a function of the number of contexts in 
which communication could take place. If, from a knowledge of the 
karate club, some specific relationship between the amount of informa-
tion and the number of contexts can be determined, a procedure for 
assigning values to C based on the number of contexts can be devised. 
The functional relationship is at least monotone increasing. Tha t is, the 
greater the number of contexts in which a pair interacted, the more the 
information that could be passed between them. The data indicate that 
the relationship is roughly linear. For instance, twice as much informa-
tion could be passed over time between individuals who interacted in 
four contexts as between individuals who interacted in only two 
contexts. 
Some ethnographic description of this proposed linearity can be 
provided. A typical message unit transmitted through the network was 
the news of a club meeting. The "goal" of any faction member was to 
pass along such information to as many members as possible of the same 
faction and to as few as possible of the opposing faction. However, as 
previously stated, the communication of such items of information was 
incidental to normal interaction. The assumption of linearity, then, 
claims that the likelihood of this item of information being communi-
cated to any individual increases linearly with the number of contexts 
in which interaction with that individual takes place. 
The assumption of linearity can also be justified mathematically. 
Given a monotone increasing function, it can be reasonably approxi-
mated by a single linear function if there is no severe change in the rate 
of increase of the function in the interval under consideration. The data 
provide no indication that such a change in rate of increase in 
information flow occurs, and thus the assumption of linearity can be 
accepted. 
The linearity of the relationship between information flow and the 
number of contexts of interaction suggests a method for generating 
values for the matrix C. Since information cannot be quantified, but has 
been shown to be a linear function of a variable that can be, the 
quantifiable variable may be used in its place, and the analysis to follow 
will not be effected, as proved in Zachary (1977, see Theorem 4).3 A 
3 In particular, Zachary (1977: Theorem 4) shows that any capacity matrix which is a linear 
multiple of the unknown but "true" capacity matrix will produce the same minimum cut as the 
"true" matrix when the maximum flow-minimum cut labeling procedure (used throughout the 
CONFLICT AND FISSION IN SMALL GROUPS 461 
specific procedure can now be outlined for generating the values of C. A 
finite set of possible contexts, chosen on the basis of observation of the 
group, will be used as the domain of a scale variable. Then, the 
relationship between each pair of individuals in the network is 
examined against this (nominal) scale. A value, equal to the total 
number of contexts from the scale in which the two individuals 
interacted, is then assigned to the corresponding entry in C. Eight 
contexts are included in the domain of the scale applied to the edges in 
the karate club network. They are: 
(1) Association in and between academic classes at the university. 
(2) Membership in Mr. Hi's private karate studio on the east side of 
the city where Mr. Hi taught nights as a part-time instructor. 
(3) Membership in Mr. Hi's private karate studio on the east side of 
the city, where many of his supporters worked out on weekends. 
(4) Student teaching at the east-side karate studio referred to in (2). 
This is different from (2) in that student teachers interacted with each 
other, but were prohibited from interacting with their sutdents. 
(5) Interaction at the university rathskeller, located in the same 
basement as the karate club's workout area. 
(6) Interaction at a student-oriented bar located across the street from 
the university campus. 
(7) Attendance at open karate tournaments held through the area at 
private karate studios. 
(8) Attendance at intercollegiate karate tournaments held at local 
universities. Since both open and intercollegiate tournaments were held on 
Saturdays, attendance at both was impossible. *â€¢ 
This scale was applied to the relationships between all pairs of 
individuals in the karate club, using data compiled over the three years 
of direct observation of interactions in the club. For each existing edge 
in E (Figure 2), the pair of individuals involved interacted in at least 
one of the above eight contexts. The quantified matrix of contexts is 
given in Figure 3, and is the third component in the capacitated 
network model (V,E,C). 
NETWORK FLOWS 
The flow of information in the club can now be analyzed with the 
fully specified model (V,E,C), by using the family of mathematical 
problems known as network flows, or Ford-Fulkerson problems, after the 
remainder of the paper) is applied. A linear multiple is a linear function in which the zero in the 
domain (here, information flow) is mapped into the zero in the range (here, number of contexts of 
interaction). Since zero potential for information flow clearly maps into zero contexts of 
interaction, the linear function used is really a linear multiple.

The scale given in the text (p. 461) was used to assign values of relative strength/ 
weakness of the relationships in the club. This matrix gives the values assigned to 
each edge specified in matrix E (Figure 2). The value represents the number of con-
texts in which interaction took place between the two individuals involved. The 
row/column ordering is the same as in Figure 2. 
two mathematicians who first extensively studied flows in networks 
(Ford and Fulkerson 1962). 
An item of political information (for example, a decision to call a 
meeting) originated with one or several individuals and was spread 
through the club. This can be interpreted in the model as a flow from 
one node to all other nodes in the network. The effect of the basic 
CONFLICT AND FISSION IN SMALL GROUPS 463 
structure of E and C (that is, the paths and strengths of relationships in 
the club) on the passage of this item of information through the network 
can be observed by noting the paths that the item will take in a given 
communication. The information (the calling of a meeting) usually 
began with one of the factional leaders, Mr. Hi or John A. This 
individual will be called the "source of the information," or simply, the 
source. Given the course of political conflict in the club, it would be 
advantageous to the source if individuals in the opposing faction did not 
receive this information. Further, the source would benefit more if the 
information would be deprived to individuals proportionately to their 
affiliation with the other factionâ€”the more closely a person was aligned 
with the other side, the less the source would benefit from his or her 
knowing about the meeting. By this reasoning, the leader of the other 
faction should be the last to receive the information. He will therefore 
be called the "sink of the information," or simply, the sinkâ€”the terms 
"source" and "sink" being standard terms from network flow theory. 
A hypothesis to be investigated is that no overt at tempt may have 
had to be made to avoid mentioning the news in the presence of 
members of the other faction because the network tended to prevent 
such meetings from occurring. The hypothesis suggests that the sink's 
faction generally would not receive the information, since members of 
opposing factions were less likely to associate, or did so in fewer different 
contexts, than members of the same faction. 
Not all individuals in the network were solidly members of one 
faction or the other. Some vacillated between the two ideological 
positions, and others were simply satisfied not to take sides. These 
individuals are key nodes in the network, in that it was through them 
that information was likely to pass from one faction to the other. The 
feedback principle can be used to state that as the frequency of crisis 
increases, these individuals are likely to be included in the network ties 
of the members of one faction to the exclusion of those of the other 
faction, regardless of whether they are politically part of that faction. It 
would be expected that these individuals would join the club formed by 
the faction with which they were associated when the split in the club 
occurred. A second, more general, hypothesis can be framed from this 
discussion: that a bottleneck in the network, representing a structural 
limitation on information flow from the source to the sink, will predict 
the break that occurred in the club at the time of the fission. The term 
"bottleneck" refers to the first hypothesis, which claims the existence of 
some structural feature in the network inhibiting information flow 
between factions. 
The validity of both hypotheses can be evaluated by a single 
mathematical technique called the maximum flowâ€”minimum cut labeling 
464 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
procedure, developed by Ford and Fulkerson (1962) when they established 
that the value of the maximum flow in a capacitated network is strictly 
determined by the values assigned to the capacities of the edges in the 
network. Intuitively stated, they proved that the maximum flow is equal 
to the capacity of the smallest possible break in the network separating 
the source from the sink. 
A break in the network is conceptualized as a division of the set of 
nodes V into two subsets, one containing the source and the other, the 
sink. The edges connecting elements of one subset to elements of the 
other are called the cut. The sum of the capacities of all edges in the cut 
is its capacity. From Ford and Fulkerson, the maximum flow is equal to 
the capacity of the minimum cut. The minimum cut, then, represents a 
bottleneck in the network and possesses the properties described in the 
two hypotheses. 
The minimum cut is located by means of an algorithm which begins 
by starting a flow moving in the network from the source to the sink. 
This flow is then systematically incremented until no more flow can be 
added because it is equal to the capacity of some edge on each possible 
path from the source to the sink. The minimum cut is comprised of 
those edges on each path from the source to the sink for which the flow 
equals the capacity. If the flow is equal to the capacity of more than one 
edge on the path, only the edge closest to the source is in the cut. 
Mathematically, the first hypothesis states that the members of one 
faction will all be on one side of the minimum cut and that the 
members of the other faction will all be on the other side. The second 
hypothesis states that the minimum cut will separate the club members 
who joined Mr. Hi's club after the split from those who joined the 
officers' club. 
N E T F L O W (Smillie 1969) is an APL language computer program 
which carries out the maximum flowâ€”minimum cut labeling procedure 
of Ford and Fulkerson. N E T F L O W was run on the model of the karate 
club, (V,E,C). The program requires that the first row/column of 
matrices E and C represent the source and that the last row/column 
(here, row/column 34) represent the sink. Hence, row/column 1 in these 
matrices designates Mr. Hi, and row/column 34 designates John A. The 
results of N E T F L O W support both hypotheses, and are summarized in 
Table 1. In all cases, except individual number 9, individuals on the 
source side of the cut belonged to Mr. Hi's faction (or no faction), and 
joined the club formed by his supporters after the split. Individuals on 
the sink side of the cut belonged to John A.'s faction (or no faction) and 
joined the club founded by the officers. Person number 9 was a weak 
supporter of John but joined Mr. Hi's club after the split. This can be 
explained by noting that he was only three weeks away from a test for 
black belt (master status) when the split in the club occurred. Had he

This table summarizes the results of the first run of NETFLOW, using matrices E and 
C as input. "Individual Number" identifies the individual with the corresponding 
row/column in the matrices. "Side of Cut" refers to the subset of V to which the 
individual was assigned by NETFLOW, either the source side or the sink side. "Fac-
tion" gives the factional affiliation of the individual, either with that of John A., 
that of Mr. Hi, or none. The strong/weak designations in this column indicate 
whether the individual was a strong or a weak supporter of the faction's ideological 
position. Finally, "club after fission" indicates which club was joined after the fis-
sion, either that formed by Mr. Hi, or that formed by the officers of the original 
club. 
466 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
joined the officers' club he would have had to give up his rank and 
begin again in a new style of karate with a white (beginner's) belt, since 
the officers had decided to change the style of karate practiced in their 
new club. Having four years of study invested in the style of Mr. Hi, the 
individual could not bring himself to repudiate his rank and start again. 
In fact, the inclusion of individual 9 in the sink side of the cut is 
supportive of both hypotheses. He was a weak political supporter of 
John A., and during the crises preceding the fission, he became 
increasingly associated with the members of John 's faction to the 
exclusion of those of Mr. Hi's. He was clearly a structural part of John 's 
faction and should have been assigned to the sink side of the cut by the 
labeling procedure. Tha t he did not follow the factional affiliation and 
join the officers' club resulted from an overriding interest, not shared by 
other club members, in remaining with Mr. Hiâ€”his black belt. It is 
important that all individuals with no factional alliance joined the club 
founded by the faction to which they were assigned by the labeling 
procedure. This is the faction to which they structurally, though not 
necessarily ideologically, belonged. 
The results of N E T F L O W verify the first hypothesis by demonstra-
ting that the factions in the club could be represented by the minimal 
cut in the network model. The second hypothesis is validated by 
demonstrating that the membership of the clubs could be predicted by 
the minimal cut in the network model. These results are not mathemati-
cally conclusive, however, unless the uniqueness of the minimal cut can 
be established. There could be several possible cuts in the network 
having the same minimal capacity. It must be proven that the cut 
chosen by N E T F L O W is the only minimal cut in the network. 
Fortunately, Ford and Fulkerson (1962:ch. 2) also established a pro-
cedure by which the uniqueness of a minimum cut can be proven. 
In this procedure, the entire original network is reversed, so that the 
source becomes the sink, and the sink, the source. The labeling 
procedure is then applied to the reversed network; if the same minimum 
cut is found, then it is unique. This procedure can be accomplished by 
reversing the row/column ordering of matrices E and C, (so that 
row/column 1 becomes row/column 34, row/column 2 becomes row/ 
column 33, etc.), and then running the N E T F L O W program on these 
reversed matrices.4 The results of this run are summarized in Table 2. 
As can be seen from Table 2, the same cut is found in the reversed 
network as in the original network. The minimum cut is then unique, in 
that there is no other cut in the network with the minimum capacity. 
The two hypotheses can be formally accepted on the basis of this 
uniqueness. The test of the two hypotheses is summarized in Table 3. 
4 Note that the matrix reversal operation used here bears no similarity or relation to either 
the matrix inversion or the matrix transposition operations frequently used in matrix algebra.

This table summarizes the results of the second run of the program NETFLOW, this 
time using the reversed matrices as input. Column 1 of the table gives the order of 
the individuals as used in Table 1 and in matrices E and C. Column 2 gives the indi-
vidual numbers in the reversed matrices. Column 3 indicates the side of the cut to 
which the individual was assigned by the first run of NETFLOW (from Table 1), and 
column 4 lists the side of the cut to which the individual was assigned by the second 
run, using the reversed matrices as input. In each case, the entry in column 3 is the 
opposite the entry in column 4. Thus, the same cut is defined by both runs, and the 
minimum cut is unique. 
CONCLUSIONS 
It has been shown how the flow of political information through the 
club interacts with the political strategy of the factions to pull apart, or 
bottleneck, the network at the factional boundary. This boundary 
corresponds to an ideological as well as an organizational division in the

This table gives the results of the NETFLOW runs used to test the two hypotheses 
(see pp. 462 ff.). The faction membership (column 2) and the club joined after the 
fission (column 5) entries were taken from the ethnographic data. These columns 
merely state what the individuals actually did. Column 3 gives the faction member-
ship as predicted by the model (based on which side of the minimum cut the individ-
ual was placed). Column 4 gives the accuracy of each of these predictions. The model 
was 100% accurate in predicting faction membership. Column 6 gives the member-
ship in the two clubs formed after the fission, again as predicted by the model (based 
on which side of the minimum cut the individual was placed). Column 7 gives the re-
sults of these predictions. The model was 97% accurate in predicting club member-

club. It is possible to extend the argument used in the description of the 
fission process to include the ideological division in the same feedback 
framework used to describe the development of the organizational 
division. 
Conflict in any setting must be bounded by some sharing of rules 
which allows the combatants or contestants to know what and how they 
are contesting. This knowledge can be at any level, from the rules of a 
game, to the shared meanings of ritual items for the gumsa and gumlao 
Kachin (Leach 1954). Whatever the level, these rules must continue to 
be understood by both players of the game, or the conflict ceases as the 
activity becomes undefined for the players. 
In the karate club, both factions shared an ideological position 
toward the club in the early stages of the conflict, but followed 
increasingly divergent positions. Their divergent positions made the 
basis for conflict increasingly unclear to the participants. It also became 
more and more difficult for members of the two factions to understand 
how the opposing side could even consider themselves as part of the 
same club. Jus t as a faction tended to know less and less about the 
political activity of its opposition, it tended to understand less and less 
its common ground with the opposition, until even the existence of the 
club ceased to serve as a basis for unity. 
It can be concluded, then, that not just political information about 
club meetings was communicated in the friendship network outside the 
club. In these contexts, club members communicated their perceptions 
and understandings of the nature of the club in various conscious and 
unconscious ways, as well. If the bottlenecking of the network prevented 
the flow of political information between factions, it also prevented the 
sharing of perceptions of the club held by various club members. In 
particular, it tended to allow sharing of these items to a greater extent 
within the factions than across the factional boundary. 
A feedback relationship, then operated in two directions, one 
organizational and one ideological. The strategy of the factions (whose 
membership was based on ideology) acted to strengthen the cut in the 
network, which itself was the organizational basis for the factions' 
existence. The cut in the network acted to intensify the ideological 
divisions on which club members based their factional affiliation. These 
feedback relationships constituted a vicious cycle, acting as a mechan-
ism which virtually assured the fission in the club. While the content 
of this mechanism was specific to the karate club, its form is a general 
feature of communication patterns in small groups, and corresponds to 
a feature inherent in the type of model used. 
This conclusion has broad implications for the anthropological 
study of small groups. The positive feedback process can be formally 
470 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
represented as a feature of a model of the group, the minimum cut in a 
capacitated network. This type of model can be constructed for any 
group, and the existence and the significance of the minimum cut, or 
bottleneck, can be tested. The results of this study certainly suggest that 
whenever a unique minimum cut exists in a capacitated network 
representation of a small group, it will act as a barrier to group unity, 
and under certain conditions, will act as a selective factor for group 
fission. 
As suggested above, the model can be generalized to include other 
types of social relationships than that used here, effective friendship. 
Moreover, the method used to generate values for the edge capacities 
can also easily be described generally as constructing a nominal scale, 
choosing subsets of elements from the nominal scale, and assigning the 
number denoting the size of the subset to the edge in question. This 
method places minimal restrictions on both ethnographers and infor-
mants. Other equally simple procedures could also be devised. 
The capacitated network model constructed here is mathematically 
much more powerful than the usual social network model. There are 
two reasons for this increased power, one mathematical and one 
anthropological. Mathematically, more information is included in the 
capacitated network model, in the form of the strengths/weaknesses of 
the edges given in matrix C. Models containing more information are 
always more powerful than those containing less, the example of the 
increased power of known-distribution statistics as compared to 
distribution-free statistics being perhaps the best-known to anthropolo-
gists. 
Anthropologically, the approach used to build the model is proces-
sual rather than static. The network model is constructed from a view of 
the social system as a processor of informationâ€”a cybernetic 
machineâ€”rather than as a static set of relationships. While the 
structural features of the network are investigated, it is the structure of a 
cybernetic process that is really being studied. It is from this informa-
tion processing approach that such things as feedback and information 
flow can be discussed and included in the model. 
Further refinement of the mathematical assumptions built into the 
model is possible. The most plausible of the assumptions made is that 
the relationship between the amount of information and the number of 
contexts is monotone increasing. While any monotonic function which 
preserves addition may be used, the present assumption of linearity can 
be justified both ethnographically and as a standard computational 
device. While this approximation has proven sufficient for this study, 
further ethnographic methods must be developed for specifying the 
relationship accurately in other cases.
