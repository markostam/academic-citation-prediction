ABSTRACT
The effect of loop length on quadruplex stability has
been studied when the G-rich strand is present
along with its complementary C-rich strand, thereby
resulting in competition between quadruplex and
duplex structures. Using model sequences with
loop lengths varying from T to T5, we carried out
extensive FRET to discover the influence of loop
length on the quadruplex-Watson Crick duplex com-
petition. The binding data show an increase in the
binding affinity of quadruplexes towards their com-
plementary strands upon increasing the loop length.
Our kinetic data reveal that unfolding of the quad-
ruplex in presence of a complementary strand
involves a contribution from a predominant slow
and a small population of fast opening conformer.
The contribution from the fast opening conformer
increases upon increasing the loop length leading
to faster duplex formation. FCS data show an
increase in the interconversion between the quad-
ruplex conformers in presence of the complemen-
tary strand, which shifts the equilibrium towards the
fast opening conformer with an increase in loop
length. The relative free-energy difference (""G8)
between the duplex and quadruplex indicates that
an increase in loop length favors duplex formation
and out competes the quadruplex.
INTRODUCTION
The fundamental unit of the G-quadruplex (1,2) is a
square planar arrangement of guanines, where each gua-
nine accepts and donates two Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds,
placing four electronegative carbonyl groups towards the
interior of the tetrad. These quartets are then stabilized by
monovalent cations (3), which form cation-dipole interac-
tions with the eight guanines, reduce the repulsion of cen-
tral oxygen atoms, enhance hydrogen bond strength and
stabilize quartet stacking. Interest in these structures has
increased markedly in the past decade, as the evidence for
their possible functional roles in vivo has accumulated.
These guanine-rich segments are found in biologically sig-
niﬁcant regions of the genome such as telomeres (4),
immunoglobulin switch regions (5) and promoter regions
of eukaryotic cells (6–8). The interconversion between
double- or single-stranded DNA and G-quadruplex in
cells is dependent upon a number of cellular proteins (9).
Some of these proteins include the b-subunit of the
Oxytricha telomere-binding protein (10), Saccharomyces
cerevisiae Rap1 (11), Sgs1 (12), Hop1 (13), Mre11 (14),
Kem1 (15) proteins and human nuclease with G4 selectiv-
ity (16). A number of proteins interacting speciﬁcally with
G-quadruplexes have been implicated in diseases like
Bloom’s (17) and Werner’s syndromes (18).
Recent bioinformatics studies have found that
sequences which can fold into G- quadruplex structures
are widely dispersed in the human genome (19,20). The
prevalence of potential quadruplex forming sequences
will depend on the guanine stretches and the nature of
the loops. Trends in the sequence of the loops derived
from a genome-wide survey of potential quadruplex
sequences reveal that the loop length and its composition
may determine the functionality of the quadruplexes and
may modulate their role between genomes. Lately, a
highly conserved potential quadruplex sequence upstream
of c-kit has been found in human, mouse, rat and chim-
panzee (21). G-stretches of potential quadruplex forming
sequences in various protooncogenes are conserved but
the regions interspersing these G-stretches, which form
the loop of the quadruplex are not conserved. However,
variation in loop length and composition aﬀects quadru-
plex topology, stability (22–28) and its molecular recogni-
tion. This may modulate the function of the gene that
harbors the potential quadruplex motif. In a genomic
context, the guanine stretches are present along with
their C-rich complementary strand, which generates a
competition between a Hoogsteen bonded quadruplex
and a Watson–Crick hydrogen bonded duplex. This
quadruplex–duplex competition has been studied for

diﬀerent sequences under various experimental conditions
(29–41). Using telomeric oligonucleotides d[AGGG(TTA
GGG)3] and d[TCCC(AATCCC)3], it has been shown that
pH, temperature and salt concentration, controls the
quadruplex-Watson Crick competition (33). Recently, we
have reported the role of osmolytes and small molecule on
quadruplex-Watson Crick competition (40). We found
that these perturbants stabilize quadruplex and shift the
equilibrium towards quadruplex formation.
Quadruplex-Watson Crick competition and the inﬂu-
ence of the loops on quadruplex stability has been inves-
tigated separately, however, the role of loop length in
modulating this competition still remains unaddressed.
Herein, we address the role of loop length on the competi-
tion between quadruplex and duplex DNA. In the present
study, we have used intramolecular quadruplex forming
sequences, which have similar G-tracts but vary in their
thymine loop length (T–T5). We compared the stability of
these quadruplexes having diﬀerent loop lengths with their
respective duplexes, estimated the binding aﬃnity and
hybridization kinetics of these preformed quadruplexes
towards their respective complementary strands, and
observed the conformational ﬂuctuations in the quadru-
plex conformers in the absence and presence of their
respective complementary strands.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oligonucleotides and nomenclature
Unlabeled and dual-labeled (50 Fluorescein and 30
TAMRA) G-rich oligonucleotides and their respective
complementary strand were procured from Sigma-
Aldrich, Singapore. All the oligonucleotides were HPLC
puriﬁed. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed
in Table 1.
The concentration of unlabeled oligonucleotide solu-
tions was determined from the absorbance at 260 nm
using a molar extinction coeﬃcient for G-rich and C-rich
strands, calculated by extrapolation of tabulated values of
the monomers and dimers (42) at 258C, using procedures
reported earlier (43). The concentration of the labeled oli-
gonucleotide was determined by measuring the absorbance
of the attached ﬂuorescein moiety at 496 nm using a molar
extinction coeﬃcient of 4.1 104/M1cm1 (44). All
experiments were done in 50mM MES buﬀer pH 7.4,
100mMKCl. CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco spectro-
polarimeter (model 715, Japan) equipped with a thermo-
electrically controlled cell holder and a cuvette with a path
length of 1 cm. CD spectra for quadruplexes (5 mM) were
recorded between 220 and 325 nm at 258C in 50mM MES
buﬀer pH 7.4, 100mM KCl. Equimolar concentration of
quadruplexes (5 mM) and their respective complementary
strands were incubated for 2 h at 258C and CD spectra
were recorded between 220 and 325 nm at 258C in 50mM
MES buﬀer pH 7.4, 100mM KCl.
Steady-state experiments
Fluorescence experiments were performed using Fluoro-
max 4 (spex) spectroﬂuorimeter and FLUOstar OPTIMA
from BMG labtech (Germany). The excitation wavelength
was set at 480 nm and the emission spectra were recorded
from 500 to 700 nm. We collected temperature-dependent
ﬂuorescence cooling and heating curves for the quadru-
plexes alone and for equimolar mixture of each quadru-
plex and with its complementary strand at the rate of
0.28C/min. These curves showed no hysteresis suggesting
that the process is in thermodynamic equilibrium (SI).
For clarity, we have only presented the cooling curves in
the main text. Normalized donor (ﬂuorescein) emission
(I520 nm=Ft/F95) at 520 nm was plotted as a function of
temperature, where Ft is the ﬂuorescence at any tempera-
ture and F95 is the ﬂuorescence at 958C. The van’t Hoﬀ
analysis was performed using the cooling proﬁle of quad-
ruplexes using a two state model for unstructured–
structured transition to obtain the thermodynamic param-
eters for quadruplex formation (45).
A FLUOstar OPTIMA ﬂuorescence plate reader
was used to determine the binding aﬃnity of each
G-quadruplex to its complementary strand. The plate
reader provides the advantage of working with many sam-
ples at very dilute concentrations and on systems that
suﬀer from thermodynamic and kinetic inertia, and
require prolonged incubation. The experiments were
done in 384-well black plates, using excitation (480 nm)
and emission (520 nm) ﬁlters for ﬂuorescein. The wells
were loaded with the solution of ﬁxed concentration of
preformed quadruplex (12 nM) and increasing concentra-
tions of complementary strand (0–300 nM). Sample mix-
tures were incubated for a period of 24 h at 258C, to ensure
attainment of equilibrium and the plate was read at
520 nm. For analysis of the data, the observed ﬂuores-
cence intensity was considered as the sum of the weighted
contributions from a folded G-quadruplex strand and an
extended G-strand:
F ¼ 1 bð ÞF0 þ bFb 1
where F is the observed ﬂuorescence intensity at each
titrant concentration, F0 and Fb are the respective ﬂuores-
cence intensities of initial and ﬁnal states of titration, b is
the mole fractions of quadruplex in duplex form.

Kinetic experiments
The kinetic experiments were performed in a Fluoromax 4
(spex) spectroﬂuorimeter. The opening up of the quadru-
plex (30 nM) upon addition of an equivalent concentra-
tion of the complementary strand was monitored as the
increase in the ﬂuorescence intensity at 520 nm as a func-
tion of time. The data obtained for G3T were ﬁt by a
single exponential Equation (4a), whereas the kinetics
data for other quadruplexes (G3T2–G3T5) required a
double exponential kinetics Equation (4b) with good
residuals (SI). The equation used was:
F ¼ A1et=1 4a
F ¼ A1et=1 þ A2et=2 4b
where 1 and 2 are the time constants of the kinetics and
A1 and A2 are their respective weighted amplitudes.
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) experiments
were performed with a home-built spectrometer using
single-photon excitation as described previously (46).
Brieﬂy, the experimental setup consists of a high-numer-
ical aperture objective lens (60, 1.2NA, water immer-
sion, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA), which focuses a
continuous wave blue laser (Argon ion Laser 1.2 mW at
488 nm from LG Laser GmbH, Germany) into the sample.
The laser power at the objective back aperture is kept
typically <100 mW. Fluorescence is collected through the
microscope objective separated from the excitation light
by a dichroic mirror (DC 514, Chroma Inc., Brattleboro,
VT, USA) and an emission ﬁlter (525DF30 DTM for the
ﬂuorescein and 585DF40 for Tamra, respectively Chroma
Inc.), and focused with an achromatic lens (F=150mm,
Newport, Irvine, CA, USA) onto a multimode ﬁber
(25 mm core diameter, Newport). The other end
of the ﬁber is connected to a ﬁber-coupled APD
detector (SPCM-AQR-150, Perkin-Elmer, Fremont, CA,
USA). The detector signal is then processed with an auto-
correlator card (ALV5000E, ALV Laser VmbH, Langen,
Germany). All FCS experiments were performed in
50mM MES buﬀer pH 7.4, 100mM KCl at 258C at
100 nM concentration in presence and absence of equimo-
lar concentration of complementary strands after 24 h of
incubation. Autocorrelation proﬁles obtained for quadru-
plex for G3T ﬁts to a single conformer model as shown in
Equation (5), whereas quadruplexes G3T2–G3T5 ﬁts to
two conformer model as shown in Equation (6) (47,48).
The autocorrelation function obtained for quadruplex
G3T with its complementary strand ﬁts to Equation (7),
and quadruplexes (G3T2–G3T5) in presence of comple-
mentary strand ﬁts to Equation (8).

RESULTS
CD spectra provide valuable information about the struc-
tural transitions in nucleic acids. We therefore recorded
the spectra of quadruplexes with similar G stretches
but varied loop length (T–T5) in the absence and presence
of their respective complementary strands. The G3T
quadruplex has a parallel conformation with characteristic
positive and negative peaks at 262 and 240 nm, respec-
tively (Figure 1a). In case of G3T2 and G3T3, there was
a positive peak at 262 nm, a small positive peak at 292 nm
and a negative peak at 237 nm, suggesting the presence of
a predominant parallel quadruplex and a small fraction of
antiparallel population (Figure 1b and c). Further increase
in the loop length for G3T4 and G3T5, resulted in a posi-
tive peak at 292 nm, a relatively small positive peak at
260 nm, and a negative peak at 238 nm, indicating the
presence of a predominant antiparallel quadruplex with
a small parallel population (Figure 1d and e). The addi-
tion of an equimolar concentration of the comple-
mentary strand to the preformed G3T quadruplex,

resulted in only a moderate shift in the positive and nega-
tive peaks to 267 and 245 nm, respectively, suggesting
minor duplex formation. Similar additions of equimolar
concentrations of respective complementary strands to
preformed G3T2 and G3T3 quadruplexes led to the sub-
stantial loss of the small band at 292 nm, and a prominent
shift in positive and negative peaks. The broad positive
peak obtained at 277 nm and the negative peak at 246 nm
suggests duplex formation with some contribution from a
residual parallel quadruplex population (Figure 1b and c).
Addition of equimolar complementary strands to pre-
formed G3T4 and G3T5 quadruplexes resulted in the pro-
minent shift in the positive peak from 292 to 280 nm and a
shift of the negative peak from 238 to 246 nm, which indi-
cates duplex formation. However, a broad shoulder
base around 290 nm still exists, suggesting the presence
of certain fraction of quadruplex in the solution
(Figure 1d and e).
Next, we assessed the inﬂuence of loop length on the
quadruplex to duplex transition by determining the bind-
ing aﬃnity of quadruplexes towards their respective com-
plementary strand through FRET. When a quadruplex
opens in presence of its complementary strand, the
distance between the donor and acceptor increases. This
results in reduced energy transfer from the donor to the
acceptor and an increase in donor signal. We monitored
the ﬂuorescence of ﬂuorescein with increasing complemen-
tary strand concentration for all the sequences used in this
study. Figure 2 represents the relative ﬂuorescence
intensity change (F) as function of the complementary
strand concentration. The diﬀerence in proﬁle of relative
ﬂuorescence intensity change (F) obtained for quadru-
plexes with diﬀerent loop length reﬂects the amount of
duplex formed upon hybridization of quadruplex to its
complementary strand. We observed that the quadruplex
formed by G3T required approximately 25 times excess of
complementary strand for maximum duplex formation
(Inset Figure 2), whereas other quadruplexes G3T2–
G3T5 required approximately 6 times excess of comple-
mentary strand for maximum duplex formation. The plot
represented in Figure 2 was used to calculate the binding
aﬃnity of quadruplexes to their complementary strands
using Equation (3). The binding aﬃnity towards the com-
plementary strands at 258C is shown in Table 2. Next, we
followed the kinetics of duplex formation, which involves
the unfolding of quadruplex and hybridization to its com-
plementary strand at 258C in 100mM KCl. Data analysis
shows that the kinetics of duplex formation for G3T fol-
lows a single exponential with mean time constant of
9896 s. However, for quadruplexes G3T2–G3T5, best ﬁt-
ting results required a double exponential kinetics model,
which reveals the presence of atleast two quadruplex con-
formers having diﬀerent duplex formation kinetics (SI).
Using Equation (4b), we obtained the relative proportions
of quadruplex conformers and their respective time con-
stant values (Table 2). Data analysis shows that duplex
formation involves a contribution from a predominant
slow opening conformer and small population of fast

opening conformer. The time constants obtained for the
slow and fast opening conformer are tabulated in Table 2.
We next investigated the dynamic behavior and confor-
mational heterogeneity in a quadruplex–duplex population
using FCS (46). This technique allows analysis of sponta-
neous ﬂuctuations in the ﬂuorescence signal arising in a
microscopic volume of ﬂuorescent sample. These
ﬂuctuations arise due to hydrodynamic processes like dif-
fusion and biophysical process like conformational ﬂuc-
tuations (49–55). Therefore, in principle this technique
can be employed to understand the inﬂuence of loop
length on dynamic ﬂuctuations in quadruplex structure
during the quadruplex-Watson Crick duplex transition.
We performed FCS measurements for quadruplexes with
similar G-stretches with varying loop length (T–T5). The
autocorrelation function for G3T ﬁts to a single diﬀusing
conformer Equation (5) with diﬀusion time (D) value of
0.095 ms. Interestingly, the autocorrelation function for
quadruplexes (G3T2–G3T5) did not ﬁt to a single diﬀusion
equation, suggesting the existence of more than one con-
former undergoing conformational transformations. These
conformational motions between interconverting confor-
mers may not substantially aﬀect the overall hydrody-
namic radius, but demonstrate variation in FRET
eﬃciency due to diﬀerence in donor and acceptor distance.
Therefore, we used Equation (6), which allows estimation
of reaction time (R) and diﬀusion time (D), and ﬁts an
autocorrelation function with reasonable residuals, as
shown in Figure 3a–e. The R in Equation (6) corresponds
to the time scale for conformational ﬂuctuations in the
quadruplex and D corresponds to the diﬀusion time of
the quadruplex through a small observation area. The ana-
lysis of FCS data shows an increase in the diﬀusion time
(D) from 0.133 to 0.164 ms when the loop length
is increased from T2 to T5 with a corresponding increase
in the conformational ﬂuctuation (R) from 0.062
to 0.093 ms (Table 3). The R and D values obtained
from Equation (6) were derived with the assumption

The kinetics of duplex formation for G3T quadruplex ﬁts to single exponential kinetics, whereas data for quadruplexes G3T2–G3T5 ﬁts to
biexponential kinetics. A1 and A2 are weighted fractions of quadruplex population hybridizing to complementary strand with their respective 1
and 2 time constant values. KA is the equilibrium constant for duplex formation. Qf and Deq is free quadruplex and duplex concentration, when
equimolar concentration of quadruplex and complementary strand (30 nM) are mixed together in 50mM MES buﬀer pH 7.4, 100mM KCl. The
amount of duplex at equilibrium, Deq, was calculated from the binding aﬃnity towards the complementary strand obtained from diﬀerent experi-
mental conditions, using the equation KA=Deq/(Q0Deq) (C0Deq), where Q0 and C0 (Q0=C0) are the initial quadruplex and complementary
strand concentration.

that R « D. But this is not observed here, as R and D
values show a diﬀerence of 2-fold. We accept that if D
and R are close, then the diﬀusion and the reaction kinetic
region in the autocorrelation function are not easily
separable. However, for the case when the diﬀusion con-
stants of the two species are nearly equal, the separation
remains a reasonable approximation, as pointed out by
Torres and Levitus (54). Further, FCS experiments were
performed to investigate the inﬂuence of complementary
strand on the interconversion amongst the quadruplex
conformers while driving duplex formation. An equimolar
solution of dual-labeled quadruplex and its complemen-
tary strand would have two ﬂuorescent populations cor-
responding to the quadruplex and duplex species, which
are expected to have diﬀerent FRET eﬃciencies and dif-
fusion time (Figure 3f–j). G3T adopts a single quadruplex
conformation and its autocorrelation function in presence
of complementary strand ﬁts to Equation (7). Here, we
assume that the duplex has only one conformation and
the estimated D1 and D2 value correspond to the diﬀusion
time of the quadruplex and duplex structure, respectively.
We observed that the D1 value was 0.088ms and D2
value was 0.198ms. However, the autocorrelation
function obtained for G3T2–G3T5 quadruplexes in pres-
ence of their respective complementary strands ﬁts to
Equation (8) which provides R, D1 and D2 values that
correspond to the conformational ﬂuctuation within the
conformers in quadruplex structure, diﬀusion time of the
quadruplex and duplex structure, respectively. We
observed that the D1 values increased from 0.105 to
0.172ms and the D2 values increased from 0.232 to
0.298ms with increase in loop length from T2 to T5. Inter-
estingly, the R values, which correspond to the conforma-
tional ﬂuctuations in the quadruplex structure decreased
from 0.059 to 0.030 ms with increase in the loop length.
This suggests the increase in ﬂuctuations among the quad-
ruplex conformers in presence of complementary strand,
especially for quadruplex with longer loop length.
We also analyzed the role of loop length on the relative
stability of quadruplex and duplex, which aﬀect the fate of
the competition. The ﬂuorescence cooling proﬁle would
involve the contribution from quadruplex, duplex and
random coil populations with the relative trend in the
donor ﬂuorescence signals as duplex> random coil>
quadruplex. The cooling proﬁle of the quadruplex alone
shows the expected sigmoidal curve except for G3T, which
melts at temperature >858C. However, the cooling curves
obtained for the equimolar concentration of both the
strands exhibited the quadruplex cooling proﬁle at higher
temperature but with further decrease in temperature, the
ﬂuorescence signal increases as shown in Figure 4. The
ﬂuorescence intensity change obtained at temperatures
>908C represents predominantly random coil contribu-
tion. Decrease in temperature results in an initial decrease
followed by subsequent increase in ﬂuorescence intensity,
which corresponds to the quadruplex and duplex forma-
tion, respectively. The relative stability of the competing
quadruplex and duplex structures would thereby
dictate the predominance of either of the structures, and
consequently aﬀect the ﬂuorescence change at 208C.
Figure 4 depicts that the ﬂuorescence intensity at

lower temperature (208C) for an equimolar mixture of
G-rich and C-rich strand varies for quadruplexes with
diﬀerent loop length. We observed an increase in the ﬂuor-
escence intensity at 208C with increase in loop length
(T2–T5). This increase in the intensity was found to be
maximum for G3T5 and minimum for G3T, indicating
maximum duplex formation for G3T5 and minimum
for G3T.
We determined the thermodynamic proﬁle of quadru-
plex formation through ﬂuorescence cooling curves (SI).
The thermodynamic parameters for quadruplex formation
were obtained using a two-state model for unstructured–
structured transition, assuming that a major contribution
is from the predominant population only. Since it is
diﬃcult to obtain the thermodynamic parameters for
quadruplex from spectroscopic measurements with high
precision, therefore, we have drawn qualitative trends
from this analysis. The thermodynamic parameters for
the G3T quadruplex could not be determined due to
high thermal stability of the structure, which melts at tem-
peratures >858C, and is in agreement with previous report
(22). Data analysis for unstructured–structure transition
of quadruplexes show that the enthalpy and entropy
vary from 44 to –31 kcal/mol and 121 to –95 cal/
mol/K for G3T2 to G3T5, respectively (Table 4).
However, the ﬂuorescence cooling curves obtained for
an equimolar G-rich and C-rich strand involves the con-
tribution from random coil, quadruplex and duplex, and
hence cannot be used to obtain the thermodynamic proﬁle
the of duplex. Therefore, we evaluated the thermodynamic
proﬁle for the duplex through the nearest neighbor (NN)
method. During past decades numerous studies have been
performed to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of
a given duplex under speciﬁed experimental conditions by
this method. It is well established that the NN method
allows evaluation of the thermal stability and the thermo-
dynamic parameters of duplexes with high precision and
the obtained results are in agreement with the experimen-
tal data. Hyther (56,57) is a tool that allows calculation of
nucleic acid hybridization thermodynamics using the NN
method. Using Hyther, we predicted the thermodynamic
proﬁle of duplexes formed by the G-rich sequence with
their respective complementary strand at experimental
strand concentration and buﬀer conditions (Table 4).
We observed that during duplex formation, for T–T5,
the enthalpy and entropy varies from 127 to 222
kcal/mol and 335 to 622 cal/mol/K, respectively. The
thermodynamic stability of duplexes was calculated to
increase from –24.2 kcal/mol to –36.3 kcal/mol upon
increasing the loop length from T to T5 (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
To understand the role of loop length on the quadruplex–
duplex competition, we determined the binding aﬃnity of
preformed quadruplexes to their complementary strands,
and obtained the following trend G3T < G3T2 < G3T3 <
G3T4 < G3T5. The change in binding aﬃnity obtained
upon increasing the loop length from T to T5 is not
very large (1.0 107M1 to 1.7 108M1), resulting in
a diﬀerence of 1.7 kcal/mol in G8 value for duplex
formation. However, the G8 for quadruplex formation
varied from 8.0 kcal/mol to –2.7 kcal/mol with increase
in loop length from T2 to T5 (Table 4). As the loop length
has opposite eﬀects on the thermodynamic stability of
quadruplexes and duplexes, the important parameter
that would dictate the predominance of either of the popu-
lation (duplex or quadruplex) is the relative free energy
diﬀerence, the G825 between the duplex and quadru-
plex structure, and not the G825 alone. G825 increases
in magnitude upon increasing the loop length from 2.2
kcal/mol to 8.5 kcal/mol for G3T2 and G3T5, respec-
tively. The greater negative magnitude of G825 implies
that the competition favors duplex formation, as in case of
T5. Further, this predominance of duplex is strongly com-
peted by the quadruplex on decreasing the loop length.
Our kinetic data reveal the presence of one conformer
for G3T quadruplex and two conformers for quadruplexes
G3T2–G3T5, which unfold at diﬀerent rates in presence of
their complementary strands. The presence of two confor-
mers (parallel and antiparallel structures) is also sup-
ported by our CD study. The conformers contributing
towards duplex formation include a predominant slow
opening conformer and a small population of fast opening

conformer. We observe increase in the population of fast
opening conformer when the loop length is increased from
T2-T5 (Table 2), which additionally contributes to faster
duplex formation. Similarly, NMR study has shown the
coexistence of interconverting parallel and antiparallel
quadruplex structures for human telomeric sequence
(58). These conformers have diﬀerent kinetics of unfolding
in presence of complementary strand resulting in double
exponential parameters for Watson–Crick duplex forma-
tion (58). We performed FCS to investigate the inﬂuence
of loop length on the interconversion between the quad-
ruplex conformers during the quadruplex–duplex compe-
tition. The sequences with loop length T2–T5, adopt
diﬀerent topologies resulting in diﬀerent D values and
these values increase with an increase in loop length. We
observed that G3T adopts only one conformation and is
in agreement with our CD and kinetics result. Whereas,
the quadruplexes G3T2–G3T5 adopt two diﬀusible con-
formers which have similar hydrodynamic radii. The inter-
conversion between these conformers decrease with
increase in loop length from T2 to T5. This can be attrib-
uted to the intramolecular stacking of loop residues which
retard the internal molecular motions within the intercon-
verting quadruplex conformers with longer loops. Similar
conformational diversity has also been reported for telo-
meric quadruplex having conformers with diﬀerent FRET
eﬃciencies (36,41,55). The FCS measurements performed
for the equimolar mixture of quadruplexes and their com-
plementary strands show increase in the diﬀusion time for
both quadruplex and duplex structure upon increase in
loop length. We also observe a concomitant increase in
the interconversion between the conformers in presence
of the complementary strand. Correlating our ﬂuorescence
binding, kinetic and FCS study, an elementary scheme for
duplex formation has been proposed in Figure 5. As illu-
strated in Figure 5, we primarily observe increase in
duplex formation upon increase in loop length of quad-
ruplex. The quadruplex structures adopted by G3T2–
G3T5 comprise of two conformers having speciﬁc inter-
conversion rate. Loop length of quadruplex structure can
modulate the interconversion between these conformers in
absence and presence of the complementary strand. The
quadruplex structure includes a predominant slow open-
ing conformer and a small population of fast opening
conformer, both contributing to duplex formation with
diﬀerent hybridization rates. In presence of the comple-
mentary strand, the interconversions between the confor-
mers increase with an increase in loop length. This shifts
the equilibrium between the conformers towards the fast
opening population, and thereby facilitating hybridization
to the complementary strand for duplex formation.
Using the equilibrium binding constants obtained in
this study for quadruplexes towards their complementary
strands, we calculated the fraction of free quadruplex (Qf)
and the amount of duplex formed (Deq) at equilibrium, as
shown in Table 2. We found that for an equimolar mixture
(30 nM) of quadruplex and its complementary strand in
100mM KCl buﬀer, duplex population increases with
increase in the loop length. Duplex is predominant in
case of G3T5, in contrast to G3T which has a predomi-
nant quadruplex population. The duplex concentration
obtained under the experimental conditions at equilibrium
was 5.8, 11.4, 16.8, 18.3 and 19.3 nM for G3T, G3T2,
G3T3, G3T4 and G3T5, respectively, (Table 2).
Comparing our earlier study on G3TTA (40) and the cur-
rent study, it is observed that the duplex formed at equili-
brium by G3TTA and G3T3 is 12.4 and 16.8 nM,
respectively. Replacing adenine residue in G3TTA with
thymine probably could aﬀect the loop topology and
allow better hybridization to the complementary strand,
and thus shift the equilibrium to favor duplex formation.
These observations give insight into the role of loop length
in modulating the predominance of the competing second-
ary structures and perturbing the dynamic equilibrium
between the quadruplex and duplex.
CONCLUSION
Loop length and its composition have vital inﬂuence on
conformation, stability and on the structural competition
between the quadruplex and Watson–Crick duplex. The
relative stability of the duplex and quadruplex structure
would dictate the predominance of either of these struc-
tures at equilibrium. Our results unambiguously reinforce
that the increase in the loop length of the potential quad-
ruplex forming sequence favors duplex formation and out-
competes the quadruplex.
Figure 5. Mechanism for duplex formation involving quadruplex with
loop length varying from T to T5. Duplex formation increases with
increase in loop length from T to T5. Quadruplex structures with
loop length T2 to T5 involve two interconverting conformers (QuadA
and QuadB). In presence of complementary strand, equilibrium between
the two conformers is shifted towards faster opening conformer QuadB,
which facilitates hybridization to complementary strand for duplex
formation.
