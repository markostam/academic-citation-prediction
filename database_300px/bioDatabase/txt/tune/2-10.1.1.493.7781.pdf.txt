While numerous proteomic analyses have been carried out on Escherichia coli, the vast majority have
focused on expression of intracellular proteins. Yet, recent literature reports imply that even in laboratory
strains, significant proteins may be found outside the cell. Here, we identify extracellular proteins
associated with nonpathogenic E. coli strain W3110. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) revealed
approximately 66 prominent protein spots during exponential growth (4 and 8 h shake flask culture) in
minimal medium. The absence of detectable nucleic acids in the culture supernatant implies these
proteins did not result from cell lysis. MALDI-TOF MS was used to identify 44 proteins, most of which
have been previously identified as either outer membrane or extracellular proteins. In addition, 2DE
protease zymogram analysis was carried out which facilitated identification of three extracellular
proteases, one of which was not observed during standard 2DE. Our results are consistent with previous
findings which imply outer membrane proteins are shed during growth.

Introduction
Protein secretion into the growth environment plays an
important role in the physiology and metabolism of both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. While there are
many reports in the literature regarding protein secretion from
fungi1 and Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Bacillus sp.),2 studies
on protein secretion from Gram-negative bacteria, especially
from Escherichai coli, are quite limited.3 This is in spite of the
fact that E. coli is widely used in the biotechnology industry
for expression of recombinant proteins and as a model
pathogen. The protein expression studies that do exist typically
focus either on the identification, purification, or characteriza-
tion of single secreted proteins, or on intracellular protein
analysis.4-8 As far as we are aware, there has not yet been a
report on global analysis of extracellular protein associated with
E. coli W3110.
This absence of data may be due to the fact that laboratory
strains of E. coli are generally classified as nonsecretors of
protein. However, in pathogenic E. coli, the secretory mecha-
nism of a number of virulence factors has been studied in some
detail.9,10 In contrast, nonpathogenic E. coil are typically
believed not to secrete protein. Recently, however, reports have
shown that cryptic genes coding for secretion and pilation are
also present in E. coil K12 laboratory strains.11-13 These genes
can be expressed during environmental variations and lead to
the release of extracellular proteins.14-16 This implies that
analysis of extracellular proteins from both pathogenic and
nonpathogenic E. coli strains can be important. This is espe-
cially true as nonpathogenic E. coli have been engineered to
secrete recombinant proteins for the bioprocess industry.17-19
To date, proteome analysis employing the high resolving
power of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) coupled
with highly sensitive mass spectrometry has proven to be the
most powerful method for identification of proteins in complex
mixtures and is suitable for the study of alteration of protein
expression in an organism under varying environmental condi-
tions.20 With the use of this powerful approach, several recent
studies have focused on analysis of extracellular proteins from
Gram-positive bacteria used in the bioprocess industry (Bacillus
sp.11,21) and pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus12 and Strepto-
coccus pneumonia13). Reports are also available on Gram-
negative pathogens (Helicobacter pylori,22 Pseudomonas,23 and
Edwardsiella tarda24).
Our objective in this study was to develop a better under-
standing of which cellular proteins are present in the extra-
cellular environment when E. coli is grown in suspension
culture. To accomplish this, we used a proteomic analysis
approach employing 2DE to separate, and mass spectrometry
to identify, extracellular proteins produced during shake flask
cultivation of E. coli W3110.

MoO4â2H2O, 2.5 mg; Zn(CH3COO)2â2H2O, 13 mg; ferric citrate,
10 mg. The media were sterilized by autoclaving for 20 min at
121 °C. Cultivations were carried out in 850 mL of medium, at
250 rpm in a baffled 3 L Erlenmeyer flask, at 37 °C, for 24 h.
Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals. Total extracellular
proteins in the culture broth were measured by Bicinchonic
acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Total nucleic acids were
measured fluorimetrically using the fluorescent dye bisBenz-
imide (Hoechst 33258; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).26
Biomass was quantified by measuring OD at 600 nm. Glucose
was measured by DNS (Dinitrosalicylic acid; Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO) method27 using glucose as standard.
Protein Sample Preparation. Samples for proteome analysis
were prepared in a manner similar to that used previ-
ously.12,13,20,24,28 Briefly, cells were removed by centrifuging at
6000g for 15 min and discarded. The clear supernatant was
collected, passed through a 0.22 ím filter, and proteins were
precipitated by treating with 20% (v/v) TCA (trichloroacetic
acid; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in ice for 30 min.
The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 6000  g for
10 min at 4 °C. The precipitated protein was further washed
with acetone to remove traces of TCA, and finally, acetone was
removed by speed vacuum treatment. TCA-precipitated protein
pellets of microbial proteins were resolubilized in sample
solubilization buffer (8 M urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 1% (w/v) DTT
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), and ampholytes 2% (v/
v) 3-10 NL (Amersham Biosciences, San Francisco, CA)). After
2-3 h with intermittent vortexing, insoluble materials were
removed by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min. The supernatant
was collected, and total soluble protein concentration was
measured (PlusOne 2-D Quant Kit, Cat. No. 80-6483-56; Am-
ersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The resulting solution was
then stored at - 80 °C for later use in 2D electrophoresis.
2D Electrophoresis. Rehydration of Immobiline Dry Strips
(IPG strip; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) with 22 íg
protein sample was carried out with an Immobiline Dry Strip
Re-swelling Tray (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. IPG strips (pH 3-10
NL), 7 cm long, were used for the present study. The rehydrated
strips were then subjected to IEF. Isoelectric focusing was
performed using Multiphor II electrophoresis unit at 20 °C in
gradient mode. Briefly, 7 cm strips were focused at 0-200 V
for 1 min, 200-3500 V for 2.30 h, and 3500 V for 2.15 h, with a
total of 8 kVh accumulated. After focusing, the strips were
stored at - 80 °C for later use. Prior to the second dimension
SDS-PAGE, IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in equilibra-
tion solution (5 mL) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 M
urea, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and traces of bro-
mophenol blue with 100 mg/10 mL (w/v) of DTT. A second
step was carried out for 15 min by adding iodoacetamide (250
mg/10 mL) instead of DTT in equilibration solution. Five
milliliters of equilibration solution was used for the 7 cm strip.
Second dimension vertical SDS-PAGE was performed using
precast mini-gels (Ready Gel, 12% Tris-HCl gel; Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA), 1 mm in thickness. A mini-vertical
electrophoresis system (Mini-Protean II) was employed ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, electro-
phoresis was performed at a constant current of 5 mA/gel for
20 min followed by 12 mA/gel for 1.5 h until the bromophenol
band had exited the gel. Gels were stained with neutral silver
stain as described previously.29 Electropherogram images were
obtained with an imaging densitometer (GS-800; Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in gray-scale mode. Molecular
weight and pI values were estimated using 2D electrophoresis
SDS-PAGE markers (Cat. No. 6539; Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO and Cat. No. 161-0310; Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA).
2D Protease Zymogram Analysis. Mini 2D zymogram gels
were prepared using 10% Tris-HCl gel, 1 mm in thickness,
having 0.9% gelatin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as the
substrate for detecting protease activity. The gels were stored
at 4 °C until use. The IEF was carried out as described above,
and the focused strips were subjected for 2D electrophoresis
also described above. After electrophoresis, the gels were
preincubated for 3-5 h in 2.5% Triton X-100 for renaturing the
protein. The gels were subsequently transferred to protease
activity buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and incu-
bated at 37 °C overnight. Finally, the gels were stained with
Coomassie blue for 3 h and destained several times in 50%
methanol and 10% acetic acid in water until the clear zones
for protease activity were visible. Electropherogram images
were obtained with an imaging densitometer (GS-800; Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
2D Gel Image Analysis. Image analyses of gels were per-
formed using Z3 software (Compugen, Tel Aviv, Israel) as
described previously.25 Briefly, images of multiple gels were
used to construct a composite or “raw master gel” (RMG) which
eliminated noise and minor experimental discrepancies be-
tween gels. Spots on the gels were then identified and assigned
a spot quantity (q) which characterizes spot size and intensity,
is defined as the sum of the gray-level values of all pixels in a
spot, and is expressed in terms of ppm (parts per million) of
the total spot quantity on the gel. Thus, q is an approximate
fractional representation of the amount of protein in a par-
ticular spot, and the ratio of q values, for the same spot on
two different gels, gives an approximation of differential protein
expression. Previous reproducibility studies in our laboratory
have shown that differential expression differences between 2-
and 3-fold are typically significant.25
Mass Spectrometry for Protein Identification. For mass
spectrometric identification, gel spots were excised, destained,
and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madi-
son, WI) as described previously.30 Peptides were extracted
twice by adding 30 íL 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 30:70 water/
acetonitrile. Desalting of the extract was carried out using Zip-
Tip C 18 reverse-phase peptide separation matrix (Millipore,
Billerica, MA). Samples were either used directly or concen-
trated under evaporative centrifugation and subjected to
matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry (Autoflex; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA).
Matrix solution was prepared fresh daily by dissolving 50 mM
R-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 30/70% acetonitrile/0.1%
TFA (trifluroacetic acid) in water. To prepare samples, 0.3 íL
of peptide solution was mixed with an equal volume of matrix
solution, deposited on the instrument target plate, and air-dried
at room temperature. Mass spectra of peptide digests were
acquired as the average of the ion signals generated by the
irradiation of the target with 50-100 laser pulses, in positive
linear mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. External
calibration was performed using the standard proteins brady
kinin (MH+ 1060.1) and insulin (MH+ 5734.6) and internally
using trypsin autolytic peak (MH+ m/z 2212.42). The average
peptide masses obtained were used for database search using
ProFound (http://prowl.rockefeller.edu/). The search was car-

ried out between MW 10-100 and pI 3-10, allowing modifica-
tion by iodoacetamide (Cys), with a maximum missed cut of

Z-score of 2.4 and a probability of at least 1.0e+000. Identifica-
tions obtained had at least 20% sequence coverage with 0.02

Results and Discussion
Cell Growth and Extracellular Protein Expression. Figure
1 shows time profiles for cell mass (absorbance at 600 nm) and
glucose concentration during typical E. coli shake flask cultiva-
tions used in this study. Cells consumed glucose as sole carbon
source, and grew exponentially for the first 10 h at a growth
rate of 0.42 h-1. At various time intervals, soluble, extracellular
protein concentration was measured and found to reach a
maximum of 3.5 mg L -1. To determine whether extracellular
protein resulted from cell lysis, we tested the culture super-
natant as described previously,26,28 and reproducibly found no
detectable nucleic acids prior to 24 h (Figure 1). As a positive
control, 36 and 48 h cultures were tested and showed a
measurable amount of DNA (data not shown). In addition, we
note that 2D gels (Figure 2) were significantly different from
gels of E. coli lysate,25,31 and (as described below) were devoid
of specific cytosolic proteins that would likely be present in
cell lysate (e.g., Hsp60 and Hsp70).
Our findings are in agreement with a recent study that
employed the same E. coli strain.28 However, these authors
conducted high cell density fermentations and found that the
extracellular protein concentration reached a value of 140 mg
L -1, in the absence of detectable nucleic acids. Additionally,
they found that the concentration of extracellular membrane
components (lipopolysacchrides and phospholipids) also in-
creased. This led to the speculation that extracellular proteins
resulted from outer membrane “shedding” versus cell lysis. We
note that it is often assumed that protein secretion, without
concomitant cell lysis, occurs primarily in Gram-positive
bacteria11 and in only a very few Gram-negative species (e.g.,
Pseudomonas sp.23). Thus, even though we found a relatively
low concentration of extracellular protein in our culture
supernatant, the identity of these proteins may provide valuable
information on the physiology and metabolic status of E. coli
during cultivation.
Proteome Analysis. To initially separate and subsequently
identify extracellular proteins, we used 2DE and mass spec-
trometry as described in the Materials and Methods. As E. coli
physiology and metabolism have been reported to change
during growth,8 we selected samples from the early (4 h)- and
late (8 h)-exponential phase for 2DE analysis (Figure 2). For
each time point, image analysis of three gels, derived from three
separate shake flask cultures, showed little pattern deviation
and a high degree of reproducibility (data not shown). In
addition, protein profiles of un-inoculated control flasks showed
no protein spots. We note that in both 4- and 8-h gels, proteins
are more concentrated in the acidic region (pI 4-7). The initial
medium pH was 7.0 and reached a final value of pH 6.2.
Proteins were also found distributed over a wide molecular
weight range (10-110 kDa) with many high molecular weight
proteins detected. A number of 8-h protein spots appear to be
larger and darker than corresponding spots in the 4-h gels. This
was confirmed by image analysis and quantification (q value).
Results are presented in Figure 3. Of the 66 most significant
protein spots, at least 18 showed significantly higher abundance
in the 8-h gel than in the 4-h gel. This increase in protein
concentration with time is consistent with the speculation that
E. coli are shedding outer membrane or periplasmic proteins
during growth.28 We note, however, that at least three promi-
nent spots (63, 64, and 65) are only present on the 4-h gel. The
disappearance of these three spots may be due to low protein
stability or proteolytic degradation in the later stages of
growth.22
Of the 66 nominal protein species observed, we successfully
identified 44 (Table 1). Previous studies imply that most are
either membrane bound or secreted proteins. Many of these
proteins are exported by specific secretory pathways and may
aid in colonization, defense, or in providing nutrients for the
cell. A number of these proteins have been reported as being
growth phase-dependent and strictly regulated by environ-
mental signals or under quorum sensing control.9,32 Details
follow.
Porin and Related Proteins. Porin and related proteins
(spots 24, 25, 30, 31, 32, and 38) comprised the most abundant
group detected in our culture supernatant and were present
during both early (4 h)- and late (8 h)-exponential phase. These
proteins generally form pore-like structures through which
small hydrophilic molecules may passively diffuse and, thus,
are typically located in the E. coli outer membrane.33 Transport
of these proteins to the outer membrane, or to the extracellular
culture medium, is not well-understood. One theory is that
outer membrane-anchored proteins have membrane-directed
signals for secretion.34 Alternatively, ompla (outer membrane
phospholipase A) may be activated during growth and then
converts the phospholipids to lysophospholipids, which may
be responsible for the asymmetry of the outer membrane. The
effect of this would be the release of membrane or periplasmic
proteins to the culture medium.35 Consistent with this is the
increased abundance of phosphoporin (phoE), outer mem-
brane protein F (Porin ompF), and outer membrane porin
protein E (phoE) (spots 31, 30, and 32, respectively) in our late-
exponential phase sample (8 h). Similar behavior was observed
for ompF during high cell density fermentation33,36 where
increased cell density led to increased soluble ompF.
Hemolysin, Colicin, and Related Proteins. We also detected
a number of known bacterial toxins in the extracellular

medium, including hemolysin-related proteins (spots 1, 9, and
37). While pathogenic strains of E. coli are known to secrete
exotoxins, such as hemolysin,37 it has also been reported that
nonpathogenic E. coli can release hemolysin due to the
overproduction of several transcriptional regulators.38 These
appear to induce hemolytic activity absent under typical
laboratory growth conditions.38 It has also been reported that
nonpathogenic E. coli contain a gsp gene cluster, homologous
to the esp genes encoding the secretory machinery for toxins
such as hemolysin.38 Lack of expression of these genes under
normal circumstances may be due to the transcription factor
HNS, which has been shown to negatively regulate the GSP
(general secretory pathway), as well as other virulence factors.39-41
In addition to hemolysin, several colicin-related proteins were
identified in the culture supernatant (spots 26, 34, and 57). Spot
34 was identified as colicin V (cvaA) and was present in culture
supernatant from both growth samples. This protein has
previously been reported to be produced by E. coli K-12
strains.42 Spot 57 was identified as microcin, which is known
to act against colicin, thus, protecting the cells themselves
against colicin lethality.43
Interestingly, overexpression of E. coli lysis proteins, such
as colicin and hemolysin, can activate otherwise dormant
phosphophlipase, resulting in hydrolysis of phosphatidyletha-
nolamine (PE).44 The result is the accumulation of lysophos-
phatidylethanolamine (LPE), which accumulates in the outer
membrane. This presumably makes the membrane permeable
to proteins and may help explain the accumulation of typically
nonsecretory proteins in the extracellular medium.45
Transport/Export Proteins. We identified a number of
proteins with transmembrane-related functions such as trans-
port of proteins, sugars, or other components. Some of these
proteins are found up-regulated in the 4-h sample. For
example, protein spot 48, identified as Transport ATP binding
protein (msbA), is up-regulated in 4-h samples. Spot number
65, which is unique and present only in the 4-h sample, has
been identified as membrane-bound ATP synthase subunit
(AtpB). While the reason it was present only in the 4-h sample
is not clear, it suggests the protein may have been proteolyti-
cally degraded or unstable in the given extracellular conditions.
Spot 39 was identified as putative transmembrane permease
(YcjO) and was present in higher concentration in late-
exponential phase samples. This protein is reported to be a
putative membrane component and belongs to the uncharac-
terized members of the ABC super family of transporters (YcjO,
YcjP, and YcjN).46 On the basis of sequence similarity, these
proteins may function together as an ATP-dependent sugar
transport system.
Type II Secretory System and Other Proteins. Recently, a
Type II secretion pathway was identified in nonpathogenic E.
coli.47 It has been reported that a subset of the Type II secretion
system can form inner membrane pilus-like structures which
act as pistons,48 “pushing” secreted protein through the gated
pores. In this study, we identified several extracellular proteins
involved in the Type II pathway. One such protein appears to
be Protein K (gspK; spot 19), of the general secretion pathway.
We also identified extracellular enzymes whose transport is said
to be controlled by the Type II secretion system, specifically
lipase (spot 40) and proteases (spots 7 and 42). It has been
reported that in many Gram-negative bacteria the secretion of
proteases and lipases is under quorum-sensing control and is
growth phase-dependent.9 Consistent with this, we observed
an up-regulation of metalloproteinase (spot 42) in late-
exponential phase (8 h) culture. Similar results, in the extra-

cellular medium, have been observed during overproduction
of serine proteases in Aeromonas hydrophila49 and lipases in
Burkholderia cepacia.50
To further assess extracellular protease activity, we used a
2D zymogram approach with gelatin as the substrate. The
protease activities in the gelatin/polyacrylamide gel can be
visualized after Coomassie staining as clear zones on a blue
background. We detected and successfully identified three
protease activities from our 8-h sample, as evidenced by the
clear zones in Figure 4. These proteases were identified as
Proteinase II (PtrB), putative protease (YcaL), which were also
found in previous 2D gels (spots 7 and 42), and putative
protease (YhjS) which was not previously identified in Figure
2. As far as we are aware, this is the first 2D-zymogram of
extracellular protease from E. coli W 3110 that has been
reported. We note that an obvious step for improving industrial
fermentations may be to delete the genes responsible for
expression of these proteases. However, although proteases
were present in the extracellular milieu, there appears to have
been relatively little proteolysis as evidenced by the fact that

most identified proteins migrated to their approximate theo-
retical molecular weight on the 2D gels (Figure 2).
Gram-negative bacterial lipoprotein is exported by the
general secretion pathway and typically consists of a large
group of proteins with many different functions. These proteins
are normally anchored either at the inner or the outer
membrane and have a signal sequence at the N-terminal end.16
In our cultures, we identified several lipoproteins released to
the medium (spots 44, 8, and 36).
We grouped other prominent identified proteins as adhe-
sion/receptor proteins, flagellar proteins, and membrane-
related proteins. We note that nearly all of these are typically
associated with the outer membrane.
Conclusions
Using 2DE, mass spectrometry, and zymogram analysis, we
report the extracellular proteome analysis for the E. coli K 12
laboratory strain W 3110. Out of 66 putative protein spots, we
successfully identified 44 proteins. These cover a broad rep-
ertoire of proteins that are typically either secreted or belong
to the outer membrane compartment of E. coli. Consistent with
the speculation of others, the accumulation of soluble mem-
brane proteins may be due to simple “leaking” or shedding of
outer membrane components to the culture supernatant,37 with
little or no cell lysis as reported earlier during E. coli fermenta-
tions.28 Thus, we conclude that the same phenomena is likely
occurring here, that extra-cellular proteins are not the result
of lysis, but of "leaking" or shedding outer membrane. We were
able to detect three proteases using a 2D-zymogram approach,
which gives direct evidence of secreted proteases in the culture
broth. A change in environmental conditions during growth
may have played a major role in the release or up-regulation
of some proteins in these noncontrolled shake flask cultiva-
tions. The occurrence of some of the toxins may be due to the
expression of some of the cryptic genes in E. coli K 12 strain W
3110 which are known to produce functional proteins due to
changes in environmental conditions or stresses. Presence of
these proteins may impact cellular behavior during fermenta-
tion or complicate recovery of beneficial products. Thus, our
results imply further studies to broaden the secretory proteome,
of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains, may provide
information on physiology applicable in the study of both
pathogens and strains used for production of recombinant
protein.
