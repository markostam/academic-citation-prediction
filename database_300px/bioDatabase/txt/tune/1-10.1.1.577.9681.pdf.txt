ABSTRACT
Although spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing in the
chordates was discovered in the tunicate Ciona
intestinalis there has been no genomic overview
analysis of the extent of trans-splicing or the make-
up of the trans-spliced and non-trans-spliced gene
populations of this model organism. Here we report
such an analysis for Ciona based on the oligo-
capping full-length cDNA approach. We randomly
sampled 2078 50-full-length ESTs representing 668
genes, or 4.2% of the entire genome. Our results
indicate that Ciona contains a single major SL,
which is efficiently trans-spliced to mRNAs tran-
scribed from a specific set of genes representing
~50% of the total number of expressed genes,
and that individual trans-spliced mRNA species
are, on average, 2–3-fold less abundant than non-
trans-spliced mRNA species. Our results also
identify a relationship between trans-splicing status
and gene functional classification; ribosomal pro-
tein genes fall predominantly into the non-trans-
spliced category. In addition, our data provide the
first evidence for the occurrence of polycistronic
transcription in Ciona. An interesting feature of the
Ciona polycistronic transcription units is that the
great majority entirely lack intercistronic sequences.
INTRODUCTION
The ascidian tunicate Ciona intestinalis is a chordate whose
160 Mb genome, with 16 000 genes, is considerably simpler
than those of vertebrates, such as man, mouse and pufferfish,
which contain 30 000 genes (1–3). The smaller number of
genes, comparatively short intergenic distances, and the
robust and experimentally accessible nature of its early
development have made the ascidian an important model
system for genetic analysis of chordate development (4,5).
In-depth knowledge of the ascidian genome will also contrib-
ute to our understanding of chordate evolution and the origins
of the vertebrate genome. This developmental and evolution-
ary relevance has driven extensive molecular genetic studies
so that Ciona has become one of the better-characterized
animals in terms of genomics resources (6,7).
Recent studies have uncovered an unexpected and strik-
ing genomic difference between tunicates and vertebrates.
This difference concerns mRNA 50-leader trans-splicing,
or spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing. In SL trans-splicing,
the original 50 ends of some pre-mRNAs are discarded and
are replaced, in a spliceosomal mechanism, by the 50-region
of a small, specialized donor RNA, the SL RNA (8). Because
multiple pre-mRNAs are trans-spliced by the same SL RNA
species, SL sequences are found as common sequences at the
50 ends of diverse mRNA species. SL trans-splicing occurs in
tunicates, including Ciona (9,10). However, despite intensive
genetics research, it has not been observed in any vertebrate,
and presumably does not occur in that group. From its patchy
distribution among the eukaryotic kingdoms and phyla, it
is not clear if SL trans-splicing is an ancestral eukaryotic
mechanism that has been secondarily lost in several lineages,
e.g. the vertebrates, arthropods, plants, fungi, or if it was
absent from the ancestral eukaryote and arose independently
within each of the several phyla in which it is now known to
occur: nematodes, flatworms, chordates, cnidarians, rotifers
and protist euglenozoans (11–14). In-depth genomic studies
of SL trans-splicing organisms, e.g. tunicates, and of related
non-trans-splicing organisms, e.g. vertebrates, are likely to
generate insight into the evolution of SL trans-splicing, and
the implications of its evolutionary gain or loss for other
aspects of genome organization and function.
The functions of SL trans-splicing are partly, but not
entirely, understood. Its best-known role is to resolve polycis-
tronic transcripts into individual 50-capped monocistronic
mRNAs, a process that has been extensively studied in nem-
atodes (15,16) flatworms (17) and in euglenozoan protists

including kinetoplastids [trypanosomes, where it is the dom-
inant mechanism of gene expression (18–22)]. Most known
SL-resolved polycistronic transcription units, or operons,
include short intercistronic sequences that in the nematode
Caenorhabditis include cis-elements playing an active role
in directing trans-splicing of downstream cistrons (23). In
Caenorhabditis, genes within operons are in some cases func-
tionally related (16), and have a significant overall tendency
to show similar patterns of mRNA accumulation (24). Thus
operons could represent a mechanism for coordinating gene
expression. However, because many operons contain genes
that have no obvious functional relationship and/or are not
coordinately expressed (16), additional non-specific factors,
such as genome compaction may also contribute to operon
evolution. Apart from its role in operons it is likely that
SL-trans-splicing has additional functions, e.g. in regulating
mRNA stability or translation (25,26) or in removing poten-
tially deleterious sequences from pre-mRNA 50-untranslated
regions (50-UTR) (27), because in nematodes and flatworms,
and possibly all trans-splicing metazoa, only a modest frac-
tion of trans-spliced genes are in operons; the majority are
transcribed mono-cistronically.
SL-trans-splicing occurs on mono- or poly-cistronic pre-
mRNA targets only at splice accepter sites that do not have
a partner donor site upstream in the transcript, i.e. unpaired
acceptor sites. Acceptor sites that are paired with an upstream
partner donor site preferentially undergo cis-splicing with
removal of the intervening intron, rather than trans-splicing
(27). All known trans-splicing metazoa appear to have a
significant class of conventionally-expressed genes that do
not contain unpaired acceptor sites and hence do not undergo
trans-splicing. However, there have been no sequence-based
overview studies of both the trans-spliced and non-trans-
spliced gene classes in any metazoan and the biological
implications of the division of the genome into these two
major gene classes remain unexplored.
The first report of SL trans-splicing in the chordates iden-
tified a 16 nt trans-spliced leader transferred to at least seven
mRNA species in Ciona (9). A distinct 40 nt SL was sub-
sequently reported in another tunicate, Oikopleura dioica,
which belongs to the distantly-related class Appendicularia
(Larvaceae), whose morphology, behavior and develop-
mental and ecological strategies differ markedly from asci-
dians, and whose genome evolution has featured a marked
overall compaction (10). In Oikopleura 12–24% of genes
give rise to trans-spliced mRNAs, including some genes in
SL-resolved operons (10). In Ciona the overall extent of
trans-splicing is unknown, and polycistronic transcription
has not been reported.
In order to advance our understanding of the Ciona gen-
ome in relation to SL-trans-splicing, we have carried out
a global overview analysis of the trans-spliced and non-
trans-spliced gene populations. Our goals were to answer
the following questions: What fraction of Ciona genes
gives rise to trans-spliced mRNAs? Are the trans-spliced
and non-trans-spliced gene classes specialized in terms of
gene function? Does the Ciona genome contain operons
that are resolved by SL trans-splicing? Is the currently-
known 16 nt SL the only one, or are additional, novel, SL
sequences also used, as in Caenorhabditis, which contains a
second SL RNA, SL2, devoted to polycistron resolution? Our
study reports the first broad samplings of both the trans-
spliced and non-trans-spliced mRNA subpopulations of any
organism, and reveals the differential distribution of a
functional gene class (ribosomal protein genes) between
these mRNA populations. It also provides the first evidence
for polycistronic transcription in Ciona. Moreover our results
reveal an interesting feature of polycistronic transcription in
Ciona, i.e. a predominance of operons entirely lacking
intercistronic sequences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ascidian eggs and embryos
Ciona intestinalis adults were cultivated at the Maizuru
Fisheries Research Station of Kyoto University, Maizuru
city, facing the Sea of Japan. They were maintained in aqua-
ria in our laboratory at Kyoto University under constant light
to induce oocyte maturation. Eggs and sperm were obtained
surgically from gonoducts. After fertilization, embryos were
reared at 18C in Millipore-filtered seawater containing
50 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate.
Construction of a full-length enriched cDNA library
Total RNA was isolated independently from four different
developmental stages (eggs, tailbud embryos, larvae and
young adults) of Ciona intestinalis by the acid guanidinium
thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform method (28). Oligo-capping
of a mixture of equal amounts of isolated RNAs was
performed using a commercially available kit (GeneRacer
kit, Invitrogen). Oligo-capped RNA was reverse-transcribed
with tagged-oligo-(dT) primer, and the resultant cDNA
was amplified by 15 cycles of PCRs with Pfu DNA poly-
merase using primers for the capping-oligo and the tag in
the oligo-(dT) primer. The amplified cDNAs were size-
fractionated by gel chromatography. After treating with Taq
DNA polymerase for 5 min at 72C, the cDNA was cloned
into pGEM-T vector (Promega).
50 End sequencing of oligo-capped cDNA clones
cDNA inserts were PCR amplified using M13 reverse and
forward primers. Successful amplifications were confirmed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. After purification of the
PCR products with Montage-PCR Filter Units (Millipore),
their sequences were determined by conventional procedures
using the big-dye terminator kits on an ABI PRISM 3700
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and the same primers
used for amplification.
Informatics analyses
50-Terminal sequences for oligo-capping cDNA clones, full-
length enriched ESTs (simply termed full-length ESTs here-
after), were BLAST-searched against themselves, and the
results were used for clustering with a threshold score of
150. The clustering result was evaluated based on mapping
information of the full-length ESTs onto the genome. We
found that one cluster contained eight different actin genes
because of high conservation of their nucleotide sequences,
and we manually corrected this problem. A unique number
was assigned to each cluster. To find spliced-leaders, 50 end

sequences of length 20 nt were compared with each other
using the CROSSMATCH program (29).
Analysis of polycistronic transcription units in the
Ciona genome was based on a set of gene models, called
Kyotograil2004, recently predicted by the grailexp program
based on 680 000 ESTs and 6500 full insert cDNA
sequences (30). Three independent approaches were used to
uncover candidate operons: analysis of gene models upstream
of mapped SL-full-length ESTs, genome-wide search for
closely-spaced head-to-tail gene models, and search among
conventional ESTs for dicistronic transcripts.
Gene models upstream of genome-mapped full-length
ESTs: All full-length ESTs were aligned with the genome
sequence using the BLAT program (31) and the genomic
distance between the 50 end of each full-length EST and the
nearest end of the nearest upstream non-overlapping gene
model was tabulated.
Genome search for closely-spaced head-to-tail gene
models: All cases where non-overlapping neighbouring
gene models in the same transcriptional orientation were
separated by less than or equal to 100 nt were recovered. In
some cases more than two gene models in a row satisfied the
criteria. Each such group of two or more gene models
was assigned a unique group identification number. In addi-
tion, groups described more in detail in the present paper
were given an independent operon identification number.
All gene groups were manually examined on the genome
browser (30) on which full-length ESTs and an extensive col-
lection of conventional ESTs were also mapped. Only groups
in which both gene models were supported by ESTs and/or
full-length ESTs were considered to be candidate operons.
Search for dicistronic conventional ESTs: All non-
redundant conventional ESTs were mapped onto the genome
by BLAT and coordinates were compared with a list of
grailexp gene model coordinates. ESTs were recovered that
mapped to two non-overlapping neighbouring gene models
having the same transcriptional orientation.
GO assesment: The proteins deduced from the gene models
were searched against human proteins with the BLAST pro-
gram (32). The human protein set used was a group of 11 632
proteins annotated with GO terms in the molecular func-
tion category among the reference sequences in NCBI
(release 9). The cut-off value for significant similarities was
set to e ¼1E  15. GO terms in the molecular function cat-
egory for each top-scoring hit were compared to determine
whether genes within each pair or group were functionally
related. GO terms in the fourth rank and their children were
treated as their parent GO terms in the third rank for efficient
comparisons. Among 179 GO terms in the third rank of the
molecular function category, 42 GO terms were associated
with genes having significant human/Ciona similarity.
Determination of operon intercistron boundaries: SL-full-
length EST sequence data precisely localized the downstream
gene’s trans-splice acceptor site. The 30 end, poly(A)-
adjacent sequences, of mRNAs derived from upstream
genes were identified through various means. Because our
major conventional cDNA 30 EST sequencing approach in
prior studies (33) had been based on priming with an
oligo(dT)-containing primer, most 30 EST sequencing runs
were lacking several bases immediately adjacent to the
poly(A). However for some short-insert cDNAs, conventional
50-EST sequences provided poly(A)-adjacent mRNA sequences.
In addition, our collection of full-insert cDNAs (6), previ-
ously sequenced by primer walking and vector-based prim-
ing, also provided poly(A)-adjacent sequence for several
mRNAs. Finally, where necessary for the present study, con-
ventional EST clones were resequenced using a vector-based
primer that permitted determination of poly(A)-adjacent
mRNA sequence.
RESULTS
50-ESTs from a full-length enriched cDNA library
In the initial discovery of SL trans-splicing in Ciona, seven
trans-spliced mRNAs were identified but the overall genomic
extent of trans-splicing was not established (9). In the present
study, we used a full-length cDNA cloning/DNA sequencing
approach to identify a significant and representative fraction
of the mRNA species in the trans-spliced and non-trans-
spliced subpopulations.
Trans-spliced and non-trans-spliced mRNAs can be recog-
nized by the presence or absence of a 50-SL. The presence/
absence of the known Ciona 16 nt SL at mRNA 50-termini
cannot be determined from existing Ciona EST data because
these ESTs are based on cDNA molecules produced by con-
ventional cloning methods, which inevitably lose 8–21 nt of
mRNA 50-sequence information in the final double-stranded
cDNA (34). In order to produce cDNA clones that do contain
the extreme mRNA 50-sequence, we used the oligo-capping
method (35). To obtain a broad and representative gene sam-
pling, we determined mRNA 50-terminal sequences for 2078
randomly-picked oligo-capping cDNA clones generated from
a mixture of egg, tailbud embryo, larva and young adult
mRNA (DDBJ accession nos.: BW648671–BW650748).
Within this study, we term these 50 end sequences full-length
ESTs to discriminate them from conventional ESTs, termed
simply ESTs, in order to avoid confusion when we compare
these two types of EST data, and in recognition of the unique
genomic applications of 50-complete, as opposed to 50-
incomplete, mRNA sequence data. Based on sequence simil-
arities, the 2078 full-length ESTs were organized into 668
clusters of related clones, each cluster representing a different
mRNA species/gene (Supplementary Table S1). Because
15 852 genes are predicted in the Ciona draft genome
sequence (7), the number of genes covered by the full-length
ESTs corresponds to 4.2% of the whole gene set. With a
sample of this size the relative numbers of trans-spliced
and non-trans-spliced genes in the genome can be estimated
with the 5% confidence interval at the 99% confidence
level. As discussed below, the evaluation of the full-length
EST set by comparison with a non-biased conventional
EST set, which we had obtained by independent experiments
previously (6), suggested that the present full-length EST set
does not contain a strong bias for or against the trans-spliced
and non-trans-spliced mRNA subpopulation.
Ciona has only one major SL
To identify trans-spliced leaders as 50-terminal sequences
shared by diverse mRNA species, we cross-compared the
first 20 nt of the full-length EST set by the CROSSMATCH

program (29). This identified a single common 50-sequence of
16 nt, identical to the previously-reported SL sequence (9)
that was shared, with a low-level of microheterogeneity
(Table 1), by 563 full-length ESTs (termed SL-full-length
ESTs) representing 332 genes. Many Ciona SL genes were
found in unassembled part of genome sequences, which
were set aside from the main assembly because of high repet-
itiveness (7), and such microheterogeneity was actually
found there (Supplementary Figure S1). Consistent with
a trans-splicing origin for the SL in these SL-full-length
EST mRNA sequences, the SL sequence itself was not
present in the genomic DNA regions encoding the mRNAs.
The 50-sequences of the remaining 1515 full-length ESTs
(non-SL-full-length ESTs), representing 350 genes, were
unique in that each was associated with only one mRNA spe-
cies (fourteen genes were represented by both SL-full-length
ESTs and non-SL-full-length ESTs). The absence of addi-
tional shared 50-sequences strongly suggests that Ciona has
only one SL or that any additional SL that might exist
could be associated with at most a very minor fraction of
the mRNA population (the probability that an additional
SL, associated with even as few as 1% of mRNA molecules,
would not have been sampled twice or more in our dataset is
<1%). In Caenorhabditis [and other Clade V nematode spe-
cies (36,37)] a second SL exists, SL2, which is trans-spliced
to 8.4–9.2% of mRNA speices, and which is used only for
resolving polycistronic transcripts (38). In other organisms—
flatworms (17), Oikopleura (10) and probably more-distantly-
related nematodes (16)—one and the same SL is used both to
trans-spliced monocistronic genes and for resolving polycis-
tronic transcripts, and our results strongly indicate that Ciona
also has a single major SL.
Global parameters of the trans-spliced and
non-trans-spliced mRNA populations
The fact that SL-full-length ESTs comprised 27% (563/2078)
of the total full-length EST population suggests that
27% of the total population of mRNA molecules are trans-
spliced. However, this assumes that trans-spliced and
non-trans-spliced mRNAs were amplified and cloned with
similar efficiency by the oligo-capping procedure. We were
able to independently confirm that this was indeed the case
by additional analysis of existing EST data from unbiased
conventional (and hence 50-incomplete) cDNA libraries (6)
representing the same developmental stages we had used to
make the oligo-capping full-length EST library. Extensive
linear overlap of conventional ESTs with our full-length
EST sequences allowed us to identify and count, in the
EST dataset, the numbers of molecules corresponding to
the trans-spliced (SL-full-length EST) and non-trans-spliced
(non-SL-full-length EST) mRNAs. The 668 genes in our full-
length EST dataset were represented by a total of 19 242
cDNA molecules in the conventional EST libraries, and, of
these, 5984 or 31%, correspond to trans-spliced mRNAs.
The excellent agreement of this figure with the 27% estim-
ated from direct analysis of the full-length EST library indic-
ates that, compared with conventional cDNA cloning, the
oligo-capping procedure did not introduce a strong bias for
or against the trans-spliced mRNA subpopulation. This find-
ing differs from that of a study of the cestode flatworm
Echinococcus, which reported that the oligo-capping method
was strongly biased against trans-spliced mRNAs (39). Pre-
sumably this bias is based on a feature of trans-spliced
Echinococcus mRNAs that is not shared with trans-spliced
Ciona mRNAs.
The gene populations represented by SL-full-length ESTs
and non-SL-full-length ESTs were almost entirely distinct;
only 14/668 genes (2.1%) were represented by both full-
length EST types (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary
Figure S2). Even among those genes represented by 3 or
more full-length ESTs, the vast majority (130/140 ¼ 92%)
were represented either entirely by SL-full-length ESTs or
entirely by non-SL-full-length ESTs. This fact establishes
several points. First, because they formed a distinct sequence
set, the multiply-represented non-SL-full-length ESTs were
not simply failed 50-incomplete copies of trans-spliced
mRNAs, but apparently represent a distinct population of
bona fide non-trans-spliced mRNA molecules. Moreover,
several lines of evidence indicated that at most a very small
fraction of even singly-represented non-SL-full-length ESTs
in our library could be 50-incomplete copies of trans-spliced
mRNAs: (i) a superabundant trans-spliced mRNA was rep-
resented by 123 SL-full-length ESTs and zero non-SL-full-
length ESTs (Supplementary Table S3) and (ii) only a
small minority (3/44) of non-SL-full-length ESTs derived
from the 14 dual trans-spliced/non-trans-spliced genes had
a structure that could be compatible with an artifactual origin
as 50-incomplete copies of the corresponding trans-spliced
mRNA (Supplementary Figure S2E and F). A second point
is that trans-splicing in Ciona is largely efficient; most of
the mRNA molecules derived from trans-spliced genes are
in fact trans-spliced (from genes represented by three or
more full-length ESTs including at least one SL-full-length
EST, we obtained a total of 256 full-length ESTs of
which 215 were SL-full-length ESTs and 41 were non-SL-
full-length ESTs, suggesting a trans-splicing efficiency for
trans-spliced genes of at least 84%). A third point is that
the trans-spliced and non-trans-spliced gene populations
each represent approximately one-half of the total gene
number: 332/668 full-length EST-represented genes were

trans-spliced, including the small number of dual trans-
spliced/non-trans-spliced genes in this category. This cor-
responds to 50%, with the 99% confidence interval being
45–55%.
The difference between the proportion of expressed genes
that give rise to trans-spliced mRNAs (50%) and the
proportion of accumulated mRNA molecules that are trans-
spliced (27–31%, as estimated above) indicates that, on aver-
age, individual trans-spliced mRNA species are 2–3-fold less
abundant than individual non-trans-spliced mRNA species.
This unexpected difference was not due to the presence of
a small number of unusually-abundant non-trans-spliced
mRNAs, but appeared to reflect general population features
(Supplementary Table S3).
The biological importance of SL trans-splicing is not
entirely understood and it is sometimes discussed to be rela-
ted with gene functions. As our study identified a significant
number of both trans-spliced and non-trans-spliced genes
within the same species, it provided a unique opportunity to
assess whether these might represent distinct functional
classes. We assessed gene function through Gene Ontology
(GO) annotations (40). Only one out of 42 assigned GO
terms in the third rank of the molecular function category
showed a clear difference in representation in the two gene
sets, suggesting extensive functional overlap of trans-spliced
and non-trans-spliced genes. However, we noted a significant
differential representation of ribosomal protein genes (GO:
0003735, structural constituent of ribosome), which were
preferentially encoded by non-trans-spliced genes. Detailed
inspection showed that seventy-six of the 79 ribosomal
protein genes we could identify in the Ciona genome were
represented in our full-length EST set (Supplementary
Table S4). None were exclusively trans-spliced, 5 were
dual trans-spliced/non-trans-spliced genes and the remaining
71 were non-trans-spliced genes. The biological significance
of this marked preference of Ciona ribosomal protein genes
for non-trans-spliced gene expression is unclear.
Polycistronic transcription units in Ciona
Our studies also revealed evidence for SL-resolved operons
in the Ciona genome. In SL-resolved operons in other organ-
isms, the member genes are transcribed in the same direction
and are very close neighbours in the genome [intercistronic
regions are most often 100 nt in the nematode Caenorhab-
ditis (16), and 23–30 nt in Oikopleura (10)]. In addition,
whereas the 50-most cistron may be trans-spliced or not, all
downstream cistrons are trans-spliced. We assessed the pos-
sible presence of similarly organized genes in Ciona by map-
ping our SL-full-length ESTs onto the genome and asking
whether any of them were located very close to upstream
gene models. For this analysis, we used an improved set of
gene models recently predicted by the grailexp program
(41) based on 680 000 ESTs and 6500 full-insert cDNA
clone sequences (30). We were able to identify upstream
gene models for 310 of the 332 SL-full-length EST-
represented trans-spliced genes. In 173 of these gene pairs
(group I) the genes were in the same transcriptional orienta-
tion and in 137 pairs they were in opposite orientation (group
II). Thus operons would be expected to be found in group I
but not in group II, nor in same-orientation (group III) or
opposite-orientation (group IV) gene pairs made up of non-
SL-full-length EST-represented genes and their upstream
neighbours. Indeed, as shown in Figure 1, we found that
very short intergenic regions (<100 nt) were moderately com-
mon in group I (9.2%, or 16 gene pairs, termed candidate
operons 1–16) but were rare in groups II, III and IV
(<1.1%), consistent with the expectation that some group I
pairs might represent SL-resolved operons. As shown below
(see Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3), detailed inspec-
tion demonstrated that these candidate operons lacked inter-
cistronic regions, which strongly supports the hypothesis of
polycistronic transcription.
We also carried out a full-length EST-independent whole-
genome computational search for neighbouring gene-model
pairs having operon-like properties, i.e. in the same orienta-
tion and separated by <100 nt. This yielded a total of 352
candidate operons, including operons 1–12 previously identi-
fied in the full-length EST-based analysis (Supplementary
Table S5; operons 13–16 were missed in this screen because
their downstream member genes were not accurately rep-
resented by the gene model set we used). Most candidate
operons (328/352 ¼ 93%) consisted of two genes, but some
appeared to contain three (21 cases) or four (3 cases) genes
(global average 2.08 genes per operon). Recognition of
candidate operons depends on accuracy in the gene model
predictions. Hence, the population of 352 candidate operons
is likely to be incomplete, although our gene model accu-
racy estimates suggest that the missing fraction would be
a minority.
To obtain direct evidence for polycistronic transcription
of candidate operons we surveyed conventional EST data
searching for cDNA clones representing incompletely pro-
cessed, unresolved dicistronic transcripts, because such
dicistronic ESTs that were experimentally obtained are theor-
etically the exact equivalent of the RT–PCR amplified dicis-
tronic transcripts. Although, in Caenorhabditis, unresolved
precursors are rare and in many cases undetectable (16), the
great depth of available Ciona EST data raised the possibility
that even rare RNA species might be found. In a grailexp
model-based scan of the EST dataset, we found eight puta-
tive dicistronic transcripts (operons 33–40, Supplementary
Table S6), all corresponding to candidate operons previously
found in the whole-genome scan. In the course of other
studies, we also found three additional putative dicistronic
transcripts (operons 41–43, Supplementary Table S6),
which had not been discovered in the grailexp model-based
dicistronic EST search or whole-genome scan because one
or both genes were not accurately represented by grailexp
models.
In the case of operon 41 the evidence for SL-resolved poly-
cistronic transcription is most extensive and is summarized in
Figure 2. Operon 41 consists of two adjacent genes in the
same transcriptional orientation. The downstream gene
encodes a homologue of the GTP-binding nuclear protein
Ran, while the upstream gene encodes a different protein sim-
ilar to hypothetical proteins in other animals. The adjacent
positioning of the genes is not a genome assembly artifact;
the raw genome shotgun sequence data, which were obtained
in the previous study (7), included eight separate reads across
the intercistron boundary (3 of which are indicated in
Figure 2). The accuracy of intron–exon structure of these

genes, and the fact that they are independent genes at the pro-
tein level, is attested by the existence in the EST dataset of
hundreds of cDNA clones corresponding to separate mono-
cistronic polyadenylated mature mRNAs (summarized in
Figure 2). In addition to the monocistronic mRNAs, the
EST data included two cDNA molecules, citb076c21 and
cima003i16, that corresponds to an unresolved dicistronic
transcript of operon 41, thereby providing direct experi-
mental evidence for polycistronic transcription. In both
cases the 30-EST sequencing run encoded Ran, while the
50-EST encoded the other protein. Finally, Ran mRNA was
represented by three SL-full-length ESTs in our full-length
EST analysis (Figure 2) and is therefore a trans-spliced
mRNA species. Thus operon 41 has every feature expected
of an SL-resolved dicistronic locus. Moreover, detailed fea-
tures of the intercistron boundary in this and other putative
incompletely-processed operons (see below) makes it very
unlikely that the dicistronic transcripts could represent aber-
rant readthrough transcripts linking two transcriptionally
independent genes (see Discussion).
Operon 43 also has all of the sorts of evidences available in
the case of operon 41, while other individual operons may
lack one or more of these pieces of evidence. However, the
collective data strongly argue that candidate operons form
a coherent set of genomic entities, most or all of which are
SL-resolved polycistrons. We found dicistronic ESTs for
nine candidate operons in addition to operons 41 and 43,
and in each case the accuracy of the genome assembly was
confirmed by multiple shotgun genome sequence reads, and
multiple cDNAs representing the separate moncistronic
mRNAs were found among the EST data. In these cases the
downstream genes did not happen to be among the 4.2% of
genes sampled in our full-length EST set, so we could not
confirm that the downstream mRNAs were trans-spliced.

However the following data showed that most, if not all,
downstream genes in candidate operons are trans-spliced.
Our full-length EST dataset included 19 genes correspond-
ing to downstream genes in candidate operons and in all 19
cases the full-length ESTs were SL-full-length ESTs
(Table 2). The absence of non-SL-full-length ESTs is not
informative in 7 of these cases because some operons were
identified solely (operons 13–16) or perhaps partly (operons
41–43) on the basis of having a downstream trans-spliced
gene. However the remaining 12 cases correspond to operons
identified in the unbiased whole-genome gene model screen,
and if there were no special relationship between candidate
operons and trans-splicing, e.g. if these were simply pairs
of transcriptionally independent genes that just happened to
be unusually close together and in the same orientation, we
would expect that the downstream genes would be trans-
spliced or not in the proportions of the corresponding gene
classes in the genome as a whole, i.e. half and half. Our find-
ing that all (12/12) downstream genes are trans-spliced rules
out the latter hypothesis (c2 test: P 0.01), strongly support-
ing SL-resolved polycistronic transcription. Moreover,
it indicates that erroneously-identified operons can be no
more than a small minority of the candidate operon set.
[As summarized in Table 2, the upstream genes in candidate
operons included both trans-spliced (6 cases) and non-trans-
spliced (14 cases) genes, which are consistent with all hypo-
theses, including SL-resolved operon gene expression].
Intercistron boundaries in operons
Detailed analysis of intercistron boundaries gave further evid-
ence consistent with SL-resolved polycistronic transcription,
and also indicated an unusual aspect of operon expression
in Ciona as compared with other organisms. The downstream
genes of operons 1–16 and 41–43 were represented by
SL-full-length ESTs, which precisely localized the trans-
splice acceptor sites. In each of these 19 cases, the 30 end
of the mRNA derived from the upstream gene could also
be precisely localized by determining poly(A)-adjacent
sequences in oligo(dT)-primed cDNA clones (see Materials
and Methods). This precise localization of 30 ends and
trans-splice acceptor sites revealed that in each of these
operons the upstream and downstream cistrons were directly
juxtaposed, with no intercistronic DNA. [An apparent excep-
tion was operon 42 in which the downstream gene was repre-
sented by a single SL-full-length EST in which the SL was
linked to exon 2; however, a gene-specific 50-RACE experi-
ment confirmed that in other mRNA molecules derived
from the downstream gene, trans-splicing did occur precisely
at the intercistron boundary marked by the upstream mRNA’s
30 end (data not shown)]. Two examples are shown in
Figure 3 and the remaining 16 cases are shown in Supple-
mentary Figure S3. In general, the first nucleotide of the
downstream cistron, to which the SL was linked, was imme-
diately adjacent to the last nucleotide of the upstream cistron,
to which poly(A) was linked, so that the G residue of the

other animals and a GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran, are immediately adjacent, so they are shown on separate lines for clarity. Protein-coding and non-coding
regions are shown by grey and green. Below the genomic DNA depiction are diagrams showing conventional EST cDNA clones aligning with exons in this
region. Each cDNA clone is represented by two EST sequencing runs, a 50-EST (red) and a 30 EST (blue), which are joined by dashed lines and which in some
cases overlap. The first cDNA clone depicted, citb076c21, is a dicistronic transcript whose 50-EST corresponds to the upstream gene and whose 30 EST
corresponds to the downstream gene (intron sequences were not present in the ESTs). An additional cDNA clone, cima003i16, was similar. Other cDNA clones
depicted represent mature monocistronic mRNAs corresponding to either the upstream or downstream gene. The bottom depiction represents SL-full-length
ESTs corresponding to the downstream gene, showing it to be trans-spliced. The genomic juxtaposition of these two cistrons is not due to an artifact of genome
assembly, because eight raw whole-genome shotgun reads, of which three are depicted by black arrows at the bottom, can be aligned across the intercistron
boundary.

AG dinucleotide immediately upstream of the trans-splice
acceptor site served as the residue to which poly(A)
was added on the upstream mRNA. This relationship
applied to all operons shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure S3, and was reflected in the majority (41/55) of
upstream gene cDNAs. In eight operons, there was microhet-
erogeneity of upstream cDNA 30 ends; in some molecules,
poly(A) addition had occurred at alternative sites 2–6 nt
upstream—exceptionally in operon 15 as far as 67 nt. This
30 end microheterogeneity could reflect partial nucleolytic
processing of the upstream mRNA 30 end prior to poly(A)
addition, or a 2 nt mispriming shift by oligo(dT) on
the . . .AGAAAAAAAA . . . . . . sequence during the first
strand synthesis (‘AG’ corresponds to the acceptor site for
the SL trans-splicing of the downstream cistron and the fol-
lowing ‘AAAAAAAA. . .. . .’ is the poly(A) tail of the
upstream gene transcript).
In no other trans-splicing organism are the majority, or
even a significant fraction, of operons known to lack inter-
cistronic DNA. However it is interesting to note that a
minor class of Caenorhabditis operons lack intercistronic
sequences and are resolved by trans-splicing with SL1 rather
than SL2 (42,43) (see Discussion).
DISCUSSION
Our study showed that the genome of Ciona is composed of
two nearly equal gene subsets with little overlap, one of
which undergoes efficient pre-mRNA trans-splicing with
the single major SL, while the other undergoes conventional
non-trans-splicing expression. The 50% trans-spliced gene
fraction we estimate for Ciona is lower than the 70–90%
estimate for nematodes (25,44), but higher than the 12–24%
estimate for Oikopleura (10). The significance of lineage-
specific differences in overall trans-splicing levels is not
clear, although it is likely that such differences could reflect,
and/or contribute to, lineage-specific features of genome
evolution.
The marked preferential encoding of ribosomal proteins by
non-trans-spliced mRNAs in Ciona is the first correlation to
be established in any organism between trans-splicing and
gene functional classification. It is of interest that a different
relationship appears to exist in Oikopleura where at least 43
ribosomal protein genes are trans-spliced (10). Ribosomal
protein gene organization strategies also differ; at least 14
Oikopleura ribosomal protein genes are associated with can-
didate operons (10), but we found only 3 of the 79 identified
Ciona ribosomal protein genes in candidate operons (data not
shown). In Caenorhabditis, the trans-splicing status for most
of the 115 known ribosomal protein genes has not been estab-
lished, although a high proportion, 40%, have been shown
to be associated with operons (16).
An unexpected finding of our study was that individual
trans-spliced mRNA species in Ciona are, on average, 2–3-
fold less abundant than non-trans-spliced mRNAs. This
issue has not yet been investigated in any other organism
and it will be of interest for future studies to establish if
a similar abundance relationship holds in other species. A
related question to be investigated is whether the mRNA
abundance difference observed in Ciona is compensated
by increased translational efficiency of trans-spliced
mRNAs. (Differing studies in nematodes have reported that
the translational efficiency of trans-spliced mRNAs is higher
than (25) or similar to (26) that of non-trans-spliced
mRNAs.)
Polycistronic transcription units
Our study led to the recognition of a set of 352 operons
(mostly dicistronic) that are resolved by trans-splicing with
the same SL used for monocistronic pre-mRNAs in the

Ciona genome. In the best characterized cases, operons 41
and 43, the evidence for SL-resolved polycistronic transcrip-
tion includes: (i) cDNA clones representing the unresolved
dicistronic transcript, (ii) SL-full-length ESTs identifying
the downstream member gene as being trans-spliced
and (iii) an unusual genomic structure featuring the complete
absence of intercistronic DNA. Because of the complete
absence of intercistronic DNA, it is unlikely that the
dicistronic transcripts could be aberrant read through tran-
scripts of independent genes. Production of the 30 end of
the upstream mRNA by primary transcript cleavage, or by
trans-splicing (see below), requires transcription across the
intercistron boundary to generate the cleavage site. Likewise,
production of the 50 end of the mature trans-spliced down-
stream mRNA requires transcription across the intercistron
boundary to generate the trans-splice acceptor site. Thus
transcription across the intercistron boundary is not
aberrant for an intercistronless operon, but is essential for
the production of any mature monocistronic mRNA from
the locus.
We found 19 candidate operons in which the downstream
genes were represented by full-length ESTs (SL-full-length
ESTs in all case). Given that the full-length EST set repres-
ents a 4.2% sampling of the entire genome, it can be estim-
ated that the genome should contain a total of 100/4.2 ·
19 ¼ 452 such intercistronless gene pairs. This number is
higher than the 352 candidate operons identified in the
whole genome gene-model scan, but the latter number was
expected to be an underestimate because it made no allow-
ance for inaccurate gene models. These findings together
form a compelling case for the existence of a coherent set
of 350–450 SL-resolved (mostly dicistronic) operons in
the Ciona genome.
Operon structure and resolution
Precise juxtaposition of upstream and downstream cistrons in
Ciona operons suggests the possibility that the trans-splicing
reaction itself could generate the 30 end of the upstream
mRNA. Indeed it seems very unlikely that an independent
transcript cleavage mechanism could, in many independent
cases, target precisely the same phosphodiester bond that is
cleaved in the trans-splicing reaction. However, because
the trans-splice acceptor site branch-point must necessarily
reside within the upstream mRNA, the latter would
presumably be released as a branched nucleic acid structure.
Unless it was rapidly debranched by an unknown mecha-
nism, this structure could have negative implications for
mRNA function. Moreover, it seems certain that prior for-
mation of the upstream mRNA’s 30 end (by a distinct mech-
anism) would preclude subsequent trans-splicing of the
downstream cistron because the trans-splice branch-point,
and acceptor site AG dinucleotide, will have been lost with
the upstream mRNA. Thus expression of genes in operons
that lack intercistronic sequences may be mutually exclusive
in the sense that any given transcript molecule may be cap-
able of producing either an upstream or a downstream
mRNA, but not both [see also Ref. (42)]. As indicated by
mRNA accumulation measured by EST counts (45), we
found that operon member genes appeared to be independ-
ently expressed in overlapping patterns that were neither
tightly coordinated nor markedly mutually exclusive, at
least at the macroscopic level (data not shown). Further bio-
chemical studies will be required to establish the mechanism
of operon resolution in Ciona and the mechanisms that regu-
late the differential accumulation of mRNAs encoded by
operons.
An observation that may be relevant to the mechanism of
operon resolution is that most Ciona operons (16/18 cases
shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3) lack the
canonical polyadenylation signal AAT(U)AAA within 40 nt
upstream of the upstream cistron polyadenylation site
(although this signal is used in a substantial fraction of
Ciona genes (Y. Satou, unpublished data). Oikopleura operon
upstream cistrons also lack the AATAAA signal (10). It can
be noted that, whereas it might be desirable to have 100%
efficient 30 end formation in monocistronic genes, this is
not the case for Ciona operon upstream cistrons because
this would almost certainly preclude trans-splicing and
expression of the downstream gene (see above). It might
then be reasonable to expect mechanistic differences in 30
end formation in monocistronic and operon gene classes.
Our findings add Ciona to the number of organisms,
including Oikopleura, in which the same SL is used both
for monocistronic and SL-resolved polycistronic expression.
It seems increasingly likely that the occurrence in Clade V
nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis, of an additional SL,
SL2, specifically devoted to operon resolution is a highly
Figure 3. Cistrons in Ciona candidate operons are immediately juxtaposed with no intervening DNA. Genomic sequences (assembly version 1.0) and coordinates
are shown on the top line of each panel, with scaffold name and nucleotide position indicated. ESTs mapping to this site are shown below; conventional ESTs for

operons are shown in Supplementary Figure S3.

specialized, lineage-specific feature (16). One of the func-
tions of the intercistronic regions in Caenorhabditis operons
is the specific recruitment of SL2 to downstream cistrons, in
preference to the more abundant SL1 (23). However it is of
great interest that a small minority of operons (at least
25 operons) in Caenorhabditis have little or no intercis-
tronic sequence and are resolved by SL1, not SL2 (42, 43;
T. Blumenthal, personal communication), similar to Ciona
operons. Ciona is the first organism known in which the
majority of operons entirely lack intercistronic DNA.
Whether the intercistron-less operons of Caenorhabditis and
Ciona represent convergent evolution or a common ancestral
character is presently unknown, but is clearly a very import-
ant question. The presence of the canonical AATAAA
cleavage/polyadenylation signal in upstream cistrons in the
three fully characterized SL1-type operons in Caenorhabditis
(42) suggests a possible mechanistic difference from the
majority of Ciona operons. Further studies of the mechanisms
of operon resolution in Ciona and in SL1-type operons of
Caenorhabditis, and additional studies of operon structure
and resolution in nematodes that lack SL2, would be of
great interest in this regard.
SL trans-splicing evolution in chordates
The presence of SL trans-splicing and its use to resolve
polycistronic transcripts in both Ciona and distantly-related
Oikopleura suggest that these were ancestral tunicate fea-
tures. However this does not establish whether trans-splicing
and operons arose early within the tunicate lineage follow-
ing the divergence of the vertebrate lineage, or were present
in the ancestral chordate and were secondarily lost in the ver-
tebrate lineage. It is interesting that despite overall similarit-
ies, there are numerous differences between SL trans-splicing
in Ciona and Oikopleura. These include the length and
sequence of the SL itself (9,10), the proportion of genes
that are trans-spliced, the presence in Oikopleura, but not
in Ciona, of 23–30 nt intercistronic sequences in candidate
operons, and the preferential encoding of ribosomal proteins
by trans-spliced and/or operon associated genes (Oikopleura)
versus non-trans-spliced and non-operon-associated genes
(Ciona). These differences, and other evolutionary genomic
differences, such as the small genome size and short intron
lengths in Oikopleura (46) suggest that further comparative
studies of tunicates may be particularly informative about
evolutionary aspects of trans-splicing and its relationship to
genome evolution.
