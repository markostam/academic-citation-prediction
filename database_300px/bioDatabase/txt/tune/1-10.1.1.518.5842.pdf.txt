ABSTRACT
It has been suggested that detection of aberrant
DNA methylation in clinical specimens such as
sputum or saliva may be a valuable tumour biomar-
ker. Any clinically applicable detection technique
must combine high sensitivity with high specificity.
In this study we describe methylation enrichment
pyrosequencing (MEP), which benefits from the
high sensitivity and specificity of methylation-
specific PCR (MSP) but has a second, confirmatory,
pyrosequencing step. The pyrosequencing reaction
is rapid, relatively inexpensive and offers significant
logistical advantages over previously described vali-
dation methods. As proof of principle, we illustrate
MEP using assays of p16 and cyclin A1 promoters
in a methylated DNA dilution matrix and also in a
clinical setting using paired saliva and oral tumour
specimens. Our results confirm that mis-priming of
MSP, with subsequent false positive results, can
occur frequently (perhaps 10%) in assays combin-
ing high numbers of PCR cycles and low concen-
trations of starting DNA. In our clinical example,
MEP of saliva-derived DNA was more sensitive than
standard non-methylation-specific pyrosequencing
as illustrated using p16 and cyclin A1 promoter
methylation assays.
INTRODUCTION
There has been remarkable progress in the knowledge of the
role of promoter methylation in human cancer. In parallel,
there have been many attempts to develop the assessment
of DNA methylation as a biomarker (1). Efforts have been
made to characterize the epigenetic signature of DNA in
circulating body fluids such as plasma (2), urine and saliva
(3). The technical challenge is to establish a sensitive techni-
que that will allow the study of the minute amounts of DNA
present in these body fluids but yet to avoid false positives.
Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) (4,5) is highly sensitive
and has been used widely in this context. However, as there
is no inbuilt measure of adequacy of bisulphite treatment, the
possibility of false positives due to inadequate conversion
of non-methylated cytosine to uracil exists. Another potential
source of false positives is mis-priming, and this may be a
greater problem when high numbers of PCR cycles or nested
primers are used. Previously described methods of controlling
for mis-priming include re-analysis by methylation-sensitive
restriction enzymes (6) or subsequent bisulphite DNA
sequencing (7).
In an attempt to overcome problems with false positives
and gain quantitative methylation data, the pyrosequencing
methylation assay (PMA) has been described elsewhere
(8,9) in which 4–25 CpG dinucleotides are individually
assayed together with a non-CpG cytosine (conversion con-
trol). This technique shows low variance in replicates over
a range of levels of methylation (8). We have developed
and successfully applied PMAs to gain quantitative data for
a series of oral squamous cell carcinoma (10). PMA, how-
ever, does not have as high sensitivity and specificity as
MSP because the primers are specifically designed to avoid
CpG dinucleotides in their sequence in order to allow the
detection of the amount of methylation in a sample quantita-
tively. Thus it is not the ideal method to sensitively detect
methylated ‘tumour’ DNA in the presence of great quantities
of unmethylated ‘normal’ DNA. In its original form, we feel
that PMA may have little value in detecting methylation in
clinical samples such as saliva, sputum or plasma.
We describe a novel combination of techniques conferring
the sensitivity and specificity of MSP while also benefit-
ing from subsequent validation using pyrosequencing: methy-
lation enrichment pyrosequencing (MEP). Pyrosequencing

offers significant advantages over conventional sequencing
in this context in that it is rapid, relatively inexpensive and
allows many samples to be analysed in parallel. We illustrate
the technique in parallel with MSP using a dilution matrix of
known concentrations of mixed methylated and unmethy-
lated DNA. As a clinical illustration of MEP we then analyse
saliva samples from head and neck squamous cell cancer
patients in comparison with previous data from paired tumour
tissue (10).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of a DNA dilution matrix
We constructed a dilution matrix to simulate the low concen-
trations of methylated DNA and possible contamination with
unmethylated DNA found in clinical body fluid samples
(Table 1). DNA was obtained from human head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma tumour tissue. Standard PMA had
been used previously to analyse these tumour samples, and
two specimens with methylation levels of 50 and 0%, respec-
tively, in the p16 gene promoter were selected. Starting
concentrations of 20 ng/ml of these known methylated and
unmethylated DNA were used to construct the matrix sam-
ples. A similar matrix using specimens with 50 and 0% cyclin
A1 promoter methylation was also constructed.
MEP
The positions of MSP, MEP, PMA and pyrosequencing
primers for p16 are shown in Figure 1. Details of cyclin A1
primers are available on request. Bisulphite treatment of
each matrix sample was undertaken using the EZ DNA
Methylation Kit (Zymo Research) and elution was carried
out using the same volume (50 ml) as the starting volume.
Three microliters (60 ng total DNA) of the resulting
bisulphite-treated matrix samples were used in 25 ml PCRs.
Hot-start PCR was carried out with HotStarTaq Master
Mix Kit (Qiagen Ltd) and the PCR conditions for both p16
and cyclin A1 MEP were 95C for 14 min 30 s; 50 cycles of
94C for 30 s, 63C for 45 s, 72C for 25 s; 72C for 10 min.
Pyrosequencing was performed using the PSQ96MA System
(Biotage) according to manufacturer’s protocol, including
single-strand binding protein.
MSP
Primers and PCR conditions used for MSP were as described
previously by Herman et al. (5) using 35 cycles.
Patients and samples
Ten consecutive patients with biopsy proven oral squamous
cell carcinoma were selected and saliva samples were
obtained before surgery using Oragene collection vials
(DNA Genotec, Ottowa, Canada). At the time of surgery,
tumour biopsies were taken and snap frozen in liquid nitro-
gen. UICC pTNM stages are recorded in Table 2. DNA
was extracted from 2 mm3 tissue and from saliva samples
using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen Ltd). DNA concentration
was measured by spectrophotometry and subsequently
adjusted to 40 ng/ml. Bisulphite treatment was undertaken
as before. Each sample was then subjected to analysis using

Analysis of pyrosequencing results
The methylation index (MtI) for each sample was calculated
at each gene promoter as the mean value of % mC for all
examined CpGs interrogated.
RESULTS
DNA dilution matrix
Matrix DNA samples were subjected to p16 MSP using pri-
mers specific for methylated or unmethylated DNA and in
two independent MEP assays for both p16 and cyclin A1.
Confirmation of PCR product quality and freedom from con-
tamination was established on 2% agarose gels with ethidium
bromide staining (Figure 2). These initial gel results confirm
the sensitivity and reproducibility of MEP both between repli-
cates and in the presence of different amounts of unmethy-
lated DNA (Figure 2b, row 1 lane 6 and row 2 lane 4;
Figure 2c, row 1 lane 8 and row 2 lane 6).
Pyrosequencing to confirm the identity of the PCR prod-
ucts was carried out on all 30 p16 and 40 cyclin A1 MEP
PCR products that produced bands on agarose gels, including
all outliers; 27/30 p16 and 36/40 cyclin A1 products had MtI
(average % methylation) >95% for both replicates. A typical
pyrogram for p16 is shown in Figure 3. However, for p16
MEP, 3/30 of the bands did not correlate with the target
sequence of the promoter region under investigation and
thus ‘failed’ during pyrosequencing. Two out of these could
be identified on the agarose gels by size difference, but one
appeared to be a PCR product of the correct size. For cyclin
A1 MEP, 3/40 of the bands did not yield the expected pro-
duct on pyrosequencing and a further single case was suc-
cessfully sequenced but was entirely unmethylated. In total,
7/70 (10%) of the positive bands appeared to result from
mis-priming.
Patient samples
PMA of tumour-derived DNA has revealed previously that
4 of the 10 cases displayed some degree of p16 promoter
methylation (MtI range 1–40%) and 7 of 10 showed cyclin
A1 promoter methylation (MtI range 4–30%) (Table 2). MtI
values were reproducible, even when they lay between 1 and
5%. PMA of the saliva DNA was positive from only 2/4 p16
and 2/7 cyclin A1 positive tumours (Table 2).
MEP was performed in triplicate on all the saliva-derived
DNA samples using p16 and cyclin A1 specific primers. Of
the 60 MEP reactions, 30 of the 31 positive bands on agarose
gels gave positive results on subsequent pyrosequencing
(Table 2). In 9/10 cases where tumour DNA demonstrated
methylation by PMA, MEP replicates from saliva samples
produced either 2/3 or 3/3 positive results (i.e. contained
methylated promoter DNA). The exception was patient 3,
where, for unknown reasons, the saliva-derived DNA concen-
tration was <10 ng/ml. PMA failed in this sample and 1/3 posi-
tives were obtained by triplicate MEP analysis only for cyclin
A1. Patients 1, 2 and 4 each generated a single positive result
from their saliva samples despite not having detectable
methylation by PMA of that gene promoter in their corre-
sponding tumour.

DISCUSSION
We describe a combination of techniques conferring both the
sensitivity and specificity of MSP and benefiting from sub-
sequent validation using pyrosequencing: MEP. As in MSP
(but unlike the standard PMA) PCR primers are specific for
methylated CpG sites within the promoter under investiga-
tion. The resultant methylation-enriched amplicon is then
subjected to pyrosequencing which determines the methyla-
tion status of a number of CpG sites as well as the complete-
ness of bisulphite treatment. This validation step allows the
number of PCR cycles to be increased to 50, enhancing the
sensitivity of MEP over MSP, with the re-assurance that
any false positives can be subsequently identified. In the con-
text of this limited clinical example, and using the criteria of
2/3 MEP positives, the test had 91% sensitivity and 100%
specificity. The one false negative (patient 3 saliva) might
arguably be excluded due to poor DNA yield, thus giving
100% sensitivity also. If a single MEP reaction is used, this
technique appears less accurate, with a 6/33 (19%) false
negative and 3/27 (11%) false positive rate. This may not
prove sufficiently accurate for clinical usage and even after

taking the extra confirmatory sequencing steps implicit in
MEP, duplicate or triplicate testing may be necessary.
The presence of a single positive result in MEP analysis
from the saliva of three patients in this study whose tumours
did not show methylation may reflect isolated false positives
or possibly very low levels of methylation (<0.5%) in their
respective tumours, which were only tested by PMA and
not MEP. Alternatively aberrant methylation from small
numbers of cells derived from other oral or other upper
aerodigestive tract epithelium may be a possibility.
As with MSP, and contrary to standard PMA, quantifica-
tion of the amount of methylated DNA present in the original
sample cannot be determined by this method. It is also
notable that some MEP products had lower methylation
percentages than might be expected, i.e. 70, 85 and 91%.
These resulted from corresponding tumours with low levels
(4, 6 and 0%, respectively) of methylation at the cyclin A1
promoter and might underline the stochastic effects of these
methylation ‘specific’ PCRs in the context of large amounts
of contaminant DNA present in such clinical samples.
The finding that PCR products of the expected size can
totally fail in subsequent pyrosequencing confirms our suspi-
cions that methylation-specific primers mis-prime in 10%
of cases, resulting in false positives when the number of
PCR cycles is increased for use with low concentrations of
methylated DNA. These false positives are identified in
MEP by the pyrosequencing stage of the reaction.
We have illustrated the clinical utility of MEP with a small
series of paired oral cancer tumour and saliva specimens. Pre-
sumably the tumour DNA in the saliva was somewhat diluted
by DNA shed from normal oral epithelium. Under these
conditions, standard quantitative PMA was insufficiently
sensitive to detect promoter methylation in several cases,
but MEP was much more valuable (when positive in at
least two of three tests performed). This example, using a
non-invasive technique of sample collection, shows the
potential for MEP to be used to detect aberrant DNA in a
clinical sample that will also contain abundant normal
DNA. We suggest this technique is suited for use with clini-
cal samples with very low concentrations of methylated DNA
and/or the presence of contaminating unmethylated DNA,
and consequently may have a role in research exploring
DNA methylation as a clinical biomarker, e.g. in dysplastic
lesions or early malignancy.
