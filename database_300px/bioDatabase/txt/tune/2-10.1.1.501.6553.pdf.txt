Strength Cond. Res. 19(2):292–297. 2005.—This study examined
the impact of using elasticized compression shorts on perfor-
mance measures and proprioception at the hip. Thirteen healthy
subjects completed 2 randomized testing sessions—one while
wearing the Coreshorts compression shorts and one while not
wearing the shorts. During each trial, active range of motion at
the hip; joint angle replication during hip flexion, abduction, and
hyperextension; leg power; agility; speed; and aerobic endurance
were measured, and subjective information pertaining to the fit
of the shorts was collected. The use of the prophylactic brace did
not limit performance on any measure except active range of
motion during hip flexion (p , 0.05). Subjective data revealed
93.3% of subjects felt the shorts were supportive, although prop-
er fit was an issue. The present results support the use of mod-
erate compression at and around the hip for the purpose of in-
jury prevention. Continued research is necessary to determine
the efficacy of hip bracing within an injured population and their
potential prophylactic benefit for active individuals.

INTRODUCTION
G roin injury can be a debilitating experience forathletes competing in sports that require quickacceleration and sudden directional changes.Groin pain is common to a broad range of in-
juries that occur in the abdominal, hip, pelvic, or thigh
areas (16, 17, 25), although such pain is most frequently
associated with muscle strain (2, 15, 37). Although ap-
proximately 5% of the active population seen for clinical
treatments report groin pain, groin injury accounts for a
disproportionately large amount of lost competition time
in athletes (3).
Those who suffer a groin injury are considered to be
at increased risk of recurrence, and subsequent injuries
are typically more severe and require longer rehabilita-
tion than the original injury (3, 26). These injuries often
occur in multidirectional sports with sudden high-velocity
or high-force contractions and decelerations. For example,
of the groin or abdominal injuries reported in the Nation-
al Hockey League, 76% were groin injuries, with 68–82%
involving the adductor muscle group. The risk of injury
was found to increase with years of play in the National
Hockey League, with a significant rate of reinjury (17–
23%). Most of the groin injuries were attributed to inter-
nal causes, with 91% of the injuries not involving contact.
Of possible causes studied, no associations were found be-
tween injury and peak isometric adductor torque, abduc-
tor flexibility, or skate blade hollow, whereas off-season
training decreased risk (15, 16).
In an attempt to reduce sport injuries, many athletes
are turning to prophylactic and functional braces for pro-
tection, support, compression, restriction of movement,
immobilization, and proprioceptive enhancement (46). Al-
though the effectiveness of a brace varies depending on
brace design, use, and the athlete’s inherent joint stabil-
ity, braces have been found to be comparable or superior
to athletic tape in restricting range of motion (ROM) and
providing support (39, 43). However, Verhagen et al. (43)
caution that restricted ROM does not necessarily increase
protection. The influence of bracing on performance has
been a point of contention for many competitive athletes.
Although braces have been frequently used during the
care of acute injuries, they are becoming more popular in
injury prevention.
The use of compression shorts in injury prevention
and rehabilitation has become popular during the last de-
cade with the commercialization of compression-type ath-
letic wear. Although light compression (via spandex) has
not been found to hinder performance (22, 23), garments
that offer more compression have not been well studied.
To fill this niche, this study examined issues of perfor-
mance and proprioception at the hip with the use of elas-
ticized compression shorts that offer considerably more
compression and resistance to movement (similar to ath-
letic training compression wraps using tensor bandages).
Specifically, this study examined measures of active ROM
(AROM), balance, agility, proprioception, endurance, and
power of healthy young adults both wearing and not
wearing elasticized compression shorts.
METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem
Using a randomized crossover study design, this study
examined the performance of active young adults while
they were wearing compression shorts (Coreshorts, Ab-
botsford, Canada) designed to offer elastic and compres-
sive support to the anatomic structures of the hip (Figure
1). This allows comparison of performance with and with-
out the compression shorts across several variables, al-
lowing determination of the ergogenic or detrimental ef-
fects of wearing the compression shorts during perfor-
mance of fitness and proprioceptive tasks.
Subjects
Ten men and 3 women (mean age 25.69 years) partici-
pated in the present study. All subjects were apparently
healthy, active young adults recruited from a university
population. Subjects were screened for size to ensure the
brace prototype would fit properly, because only 2 sizes
of the prototype were available. Written informed consent

was obtained before all testing, whereas subjects were
medically screened for apparent health disorder or un-
resolved musculoskeletal injury. Ethical approval for the
study was obtained from the university research ethics
committee.
Coreshorts
Coreshorts are elasticized compression shorts that offer
both compression and resistance to increased ROM. The
compression offered is significantly more than would be
found in spandex compression shorts, similar to that de-
scribed by Doan et al. (14). In a static standing position
the garment offers circumferential compression, whereas
on movement the diagonal band orientation provides mul-
tidirectional tension. The design mimics the functional
anatomy of the hip area and, in particular, the anterior
and posterior diagonal slings as described by Vleeming et
al. (44). Duplicating the diagonal slings allows the Core-
shorts to support force closure for the core and hip areas,
providing support for injury prevention and functional re-
turn to activity after injury during multidirectional activ-
ities.
Procedures
All subjects completed the test battery twice, once while
wearing Coreshorts and once without. The trial per-
formed while wearing the compression shorts was the
first activity performed in the shorts after determining
proper fit. A randomized crossover design was used with
7 subjects performing with and without the shorts on
each trial. The AROM measurements were performed us-
ing a Leighton Flexometer (Leighton Flexometer, Inc.,
Spokane, WA) placed on the anterior or lateral aspect of
the subject’s thigh. Supine hip flexion, prone hip hyper-
extension, and standing hip abduction were each mea-
sured twice. A standing measure of joint angle replication
was performed with the hip flexed, abducted, and then
hyperextended to 308. The subject was actively moved to
the target angle and cued to remember that position. The
subject then attempted to replicate the target joint angle
twice (similar to Barrack et al. (4)).
Balance was assessed using a stork stance while the
subjects had their eyes closed. One timed trial was al-
lowed. The Canadian Physical Activity, Fitness, and Life-
style Appraisal (10) vertical jump protocol was used to
assess leg power, with each subject completing 2 trials.
The T-test was used to assess agility with 1 timed trial
(33, 38, 43). One trial of a timed 20-m dash was conducted
to test speed, whereas the 20-m multistage shuttle run
was performed to assess aerobic capacity (27, 28).
Subjects who completed the test battery while wearing
the Coreshorts were asked to complete a subjective eval-
uation of the device. The subjects were asked to indicate
their level of agreement for 6 statements regarding com-
fort, fit, support, hindering or enhancing performance,
and whether they would wear Coreshorts during sporting
activities. Each statement was ranked on a 5-point scale
from strongly disagree (rated as 1) to strongly agree (rat-
ed as 5). Subjects were given space to specify which sport
they play and were also encouraged to write any addi-
tional comments on the questionnaire.
Statistical Analyses
The largest angle produced during each of the AROM
movements was used for analysis. Similarly, the best of
2 trials was used for the power measurement. The value
from the 2 joint replication trials that was closest to the
target joint angle was used for assessment. This value
was represented as absolute error in degrees. All other
tests used the value obtained during the single trial. A
comparison of means between the braced and unbraced
condition for each test was performed using an analysis
of variance. The criterion for statistical significance was
set at p # 0.05. Interclass correlations were performed
between braced and unbraced conditions to determine the
relationship between scores in both experimental condi-
tions. The percentage of subjects who responded to each
statement of the subjective evaluation in the same way
was calculated.
RESULTS
Test results (mean 6 SD) are summarized in Table 1 for
the 10 men and 3 women who completed both experimen-
tal conditions. No statistical differences (p # 0.05) be-
tween the braced and nonbraced conditions were found
except for AROM during hip flexion (p 5 0.016). Inter-
class correlations were high (r . 0.80) for hip hyperex-
tension, agility run, vertical jump, speed, and aerobic ca-
pacity measures. Interclass correlations were poor (r ,
0.05) for joint AROM duplication during abduction and
hip flexion.
Responses to the 6 statements of the subjective eval-
uation indicate that subjects did not find the shorts to
hinder performance. To the statement I feel the shorts are
comfortable, 46.15% disagreed, 30.77% neither agreed nor
disagreed, and 23.08% agreed. A total of 61.53% of sub-
jects disagreed or strongly disagreed to the statement I
feel the shorts fit properly, with 23.07% who either agreed
or strongly agreed. A total of 93.31% of the subjects
agreed or strongly agreed with the statement I feel the
shorts are supportive, with only 7.69% responding neu-
trally and no disagreement. Results for the statements I
feel the shorts hindered my test results and I feel the shorts
would enhance my performance were identical. There
were no strongly agree or strongly disagree responses for
either statement, whereas 61.54% had a neutral re-
sponse. Slightly more subjects agreed (23.08%) than dis-
agreed (15.38%) with the statements. Finally, to the

statement I would wear these shorts during sporting ac-
tivities, 30.76% either disagreed or strongly disagreed,
whereas slightly more (38.46%) agreed or strongly
agreed.
Before participation in the study, subjects tried on the
shorts and were asked if they would feel comfortable
wearing the shorts for 1 hour and if they would be able
to perform running and jumping activities while wearing
the shorts. However, because there were only 2 sizes of
the prototype shorts available (a medium and large based
on proportionate waist, hip, and thigh girth), short fit was
an issue. Subjects complained of elastic compression over
the gonadal area and tightness around the lower thigh
with subjects who exhibited wide ranges of thigh girth for
a given hip and waist girth. The only area where constant
compressions could not be maintained was at the inguinal
crease during flexion at the hip. No sex differences in re-
sponses were apparent.
DISCUSSION
Results from previous studies that examined the efficacy
of joint bracing vary, depending on the joint, testing pro-
cedure, and brace selection, although it is generally
agreed that braces have little adverse effect on most ac-
tivities other than vertical jump (8, 9, 29). Because these
studies were not conducted with hip braces, it was nec-
essary for this pilot work to examine the effect of hip brac-
ing on performance in a healthy population before pro-
ceeding to injured individuals. Although long-term brace
use has been found to have no effect on muscle firing (13),
reduced electromyographic activity has been recorded
during brace use (32, 45). The research of Osternig and
Robertson (32) indicates there may be a change in neu-
romuscular control of the lower extremity due to a sig-
nificant change in ROM for braced subjects during run-
ning. Whether electromyographic activity and neuromus-
cular control changes are related is unclear. Subjective
evaluations of brace use are generally positive, with sub-
jects feeling more confident and less pain due to delayed-
onset muscle soreness and reporting that the brace en-
hanced test performance (7, 24, 25).
Subjective evaluations of the compression shorts used
in the present study are similar to those reported previ-
ously for neoprene compression sleeves (7, 24, 25). The
Coreshorts prototype used in the present study was de-
signed to provide multidirectional support, offering in-
creased resistance to excessive motion at the hip joint in
each plane of motion. Subjective evaluations suggest that
most subjects (93.31%) felt the shorts were supportive.
When asked if the brace hindered their test results and
if the brace would enhance their performance, the results
were identical. These statements appear contradictory;
however, additional comments provided by the subjects
and the responses to the statement about comfort (46.15%
disagreement) clarify this discrepancy. Only one size of
the Coreshorts prototype was used for this study. Al-
though all subjects were able to fit into the brace, the
comments on the questionnaire centered around sizing
changes that would enhance comfort and result in per-
formance enhancement. Therefore, when responding to
statements about the current test, the subjects felt sup-
ported; however, discomfort made them feel hindered.
When responding to the statement I feel the shorts would
enhance my performance, an addendum for proper fit was
often included. Although the subjects recognized a benefit
to the use of the brace, sizing changes were necessary.
Specific suggestions for changes to sizing included sepa-
rate thigh and waist measurements or the addition of a
lacing or strap system to achieve a more customized fit.
The only significant performance difference between
the braced and unbraced condition was found in AROM
during hip flexion, similar to the findings of Doan et al.
(14). The fact that there were no differences in AROM
ATHLETE USE OF COMPRESSION SHORTS 295
during hyperextension and abduction of the thigh may
indicate a restriction in ROM only with large changes in
joint angle, which may be beneficial in preventing injury
while allowing functional movement. The increasing re-
sistance offered by the elastic brace material when it is
lengthened applies a progressive force to limit movement
into an individual’s end ROM. This may prevent injury
in itself and/or work by aiding thigh deceleration during
such movements as the follow-through of a soccer kick.
It has been hypothesized that the resistance provided
by a brace will fatigue muscles more quickly, resulting in
an increased risk of injury as proprioceptive control is
decreased. Previous research has found a decrease in an
individual’s ability to distinguish different movement
speeds, replicate joint angles, or detect thresholds of
movement after fatigue (11, 34, 41), whereas many others
have not found any significant decrease in test measure-
ment (18, 41). Although differing protocols, joints, and
targeted mechanoreceptors make comparisons difficult,
the present results (which found similar aerobic capacity
during compression shorts and noncompression shorts
trials) do not support the notion that compression shorts
contribute to fatigue in repetitive movement. The present
results support previous work that found no significant
differences in postexercise lactate levels in individuals
wearing elastic tights (5) and reports of increased venous
blood flow during compression garment use (31). These
results are supported more recently by Kraemer et al.
(22), who found no improvement in single maximal jump
powers but found compression shorts helped maintain
higher jumping power during repetitive vertical jumps.
Proprioception allows an individual to know where
body segments are in space, direction and speed of move-
ment, and amount of force applied through information
received from mechanoreceptors located in the skin, mus-
cles, tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules (7). Each
mechanoreceptor is found in a different location and re-
sponds in a unique way to specific stimuli. Researchers
know that factors such as aging, joint effusion, and an-
esthesia have a negative impact on an individual’s pro-
prioceptive ability (35); however, the specific contribution
of each proprioceptor to the total control mechanism is
not certain (18). An individual’s inherent proprioceptive
capability appears to be an important component in the
effectiveness of any intervention. Several studies have
found that individuals with poor inherent stability or pro-
prioception derive the greatest benefit from an external
support (7, 9, 35). Initial research into proprioception con-
centrated on the role of capsular receptors that were be-
lieved to be a major contributor to stability (18, 41); how-
ever, the focus has recently shifted to the response of
muscle spindles (18, 42).
Activation of cutaneous tactile mechanoreceptors or
electrical stimulation of mechanoreceptive afferents has
been shown to reduce presynaptic inhibition in both the
leg (20) and the arm (1). Since proprioception is affected
by input from muscle spindle afferents, this would have
the net effect of increasing proprioceptive sensitivity. Al-
though it is reasonable to suggest that compression shorts
strongly activate cutaneous mechanoreceptors around the
hip, similar improvements in proprioceptive sensitivity
may result from their use (although there is no direct
evidence to support this).
There is growing evidence that movement of skin
overlying stretching muscle triggers cutaneous receptors
to send important joint position information to the brain
(30, 40). Skin stretch has been found to be an important
source of proprioceptive information (12). If compression
enhanced this effect, it might also yield increased sensi-
tivity, supporting the use of bracing material around the
joints. The compressive quality of elastic braces is
thought to make the stimuli of underlying muscle move-
ment more prominent, thereby enhancing activation of
these cutaneous receptors (9, 40). Due to the number and
complexity of different receptors active in proprioception,
it is not surprising that current results are equivocal. Dif-
fering test protocols and the specific movement and re-
ceptor placement patterns of each joint make research
challenging. Although some researchers have found no
beneficial effect of bracing on proprioception (6, 21, 36),
many others have found a significant improvement (19,
35, 39). Using neoprene and rubber compression shorts
that would offer increased compression similar to the
shorts used in the present study, Doan et al. (14) found
countermovement vertical jump height and 60-m sprint
times to be enhanced.
With no significant difference between joint angle rep-
lication during the braced and unbraced conditions, the
present results do not support enhanced proprioception
at the hip during periods of compression. However, the
use of apparently healthy, active individuals in the cur-
rent study may account for the lack of significance, since
their proprioceptive abilities were not hindered by injury.
Birmingham et al. (7), Callaghan (9), and Perlau et al.
(35) suggest that there is an inverse relationship between
inherent proprioceptive ability and benefit from brace
use. Therefore, individuals with poor inherent proprio-
ceptive ability would derive the greatest benefit from a
brace. Further research with injured subjects would be
necessary to confirm this association.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The purpose of this study was to examine potential ben-
efits and disadvantages of wearing elasticized compres-
sion shorts during various sporting activities. Using in-
formation from research on other joints, it was hypothe-
sized that the use of compression shorts may hinder
speed, agility, and aerobic capacity, while enhancing pro-
prioception. However, our results could not support either
hypothesis. The use of elastic compression shorts did not
appear to affect performance and may be useful for injury
prevention and during recovery from injury, offering me-
chanical support and potentially enhancing neural input
(14) .
Our results were consistent with that of others who
suggest bracing does not significantly limit performance
(9, 14, 22, 23, 29). Although the research by Burks et al.
(8) found that sprint and vertical jump were negatively
affected, the results from the current study do not sup-
port this conclusion. This discrepancy is likely due to the
use of a hip brace in the current study, as opposed to
Burks’ use of ankle bracing. Limitations to performance
as a result of bracing may be more marked when bracing
distal joints of the lower extremity.
