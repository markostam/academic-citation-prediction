ABSTRACT
The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository at
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) archives and freely disseminates microarray
and other forms of high-throughput data generated
by the scientific community. The database has
a minimum information about a microarray experi-
ment (MIAME)-compliant infrastructure that cap-
tures fully annotated raw and processed data.
Several data deposit options and formats are
supported, including web forms, spreadsheets,
XML and Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT).
In addition to data storage, a collection of user-
friendly web-based interfaces and applications are
available to help users effectively explore, visualize
and download the thousands of experiments and
tens of millions of gene expression patterns stored
in GEO. This paper provides a summary of the GEO
database structure and user facilities, and describes
recent enhancements to database design, perfor-
mance, submission format options, data query and
retrieval utilities. GEO is accessible at http://www.

INTRODUCTION
Microarray and other high-throughput technologies have led
to an explosion in the rate of molecular abundance data gen-
erated in the last decade. For the last seven years the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database has served as a central
hub for these data, operating primarily as a public archive and
distribution center, but also providing flexible mining tools
that enable users to easily query, filter, inspect and download
data in the context of their specific interests (1,2).
GEO is currently the largest fully public gene expression
resource. Since its inception, the database has grown
exponentially each year. As of September 2006, the database
holds over 120 000 samples, representing over 3.2 billion
individual measurements, spanning over 200 organisms, and
addressing a wide variety of biological phenomena. These
data have been deposited by >2000 laboratories from around
the world. All data are freely available online and via bulk
FTP download.
GEO supports minimum information about a microarray
experiment (MIAME)-compliant data submissions. MIAME
is a data content standard developed by the microarray
gene expression data (MGED) society to outline what infor-
mation should be provided when describing a microarray
experiment (3). Making microarray data public in a
MIAME-compliant manner has become a precondition for
publication for many journals. Publishing original data and
protocols facilitates independent evaluation of results and
reanalysis, and is in keeping with the spirit of open-access
(4). Consequently, most of the data in GEO have been sub-
mitted by the research community in fulfillment of journal
requirements.
DATABASE STRUCTURE AND DATA FLOW
The GEO database architecture is designed for the efficient
capture, storage and retrieval of large-scale functional
genomic data. The diverse and complex nature of such data
presents considerable challenges in data handling and query-
ing. There are many different types of high-throughput meth-
odologies and researchers use a wide variety of hardware
and software to generate and process data. Thus, data come
in many different formats and comprise varying content.
Furthermore, technologies and processing strategies continue
to rapidly evolve. In light of these considerations, GEO was
designed with a flexible structure that can accommodate
diverse styles of data. This flexibility is largely attributed to
the fact that tabular data are not fully granulated in the core
database but instead are treated as plain text, tab-delimited
tables that may contain any number of rows or columns.
Although the primary database has no knowledge and applies
no restrictions on these tab-delimited tables, some columns
reserve special meanings and data from selected fields are
extracted to secondary databases and used in downstream

query and analysis applications. Accompanying supplemen-
tary and native file types are linked from each record and
stored on an FTP server.
Expression data can be rendered meaningless unless
accompanied by the contextual biological and processing
details under which they were generated. To address this,
GEO has a MIAME-compliant infrastructure that supports
fully annotated records. Biological and other descriptive
metadata are stored in designated fields with proper relations
or restrictions within database tables.
Submitter-supplied data
The overall structure of the core GEO database remains as
described previously (1,2). Briefly, data submitted to GEO
are stored in a relational MSSQL database partitioned into
three entity types:
Platform. Includes a summary description of the array and
a data table defining the array template. Each row in the
table corresponds to a single feature, and includes sequence
annotation and tracking information as provided by the
submitter. The table may contain any number of columns
allowing thorough annotation of the array.
Sample. Includes a description of the biological material and
the experimental protocols to which it was subjected, and a
data table containing hybridization measurements for each
feature on the corresponding platform. The table may contain
any number of columns in which to comprehensively present
hybridization results. The metadata fields may hold very
large volumes of text to allow elaborate descriptions of the
biological source and protocols.
Series. Defines a set of related samples considered to be part
of a study, and describes the overall study aim and design.
Series may also incorporate tabular summary tables pertain-
ing to the experiment as a whole.
Each of these objects is essentially under the submitter’s
editorial control and is assigned a stable and unique accession
number that may be used to cite and retrieve the records. The
accession consists of a number and a letter prefix indicating
whether the record is a GEO Platform (GPL), GEO Sample
(GSM), or GEO Series (GSE).
In addition to the user-submitted objects described above,
GEO defines and creates a number of related data objects to
facilitate data mining, visual rendering and transposition of
submitted data into alternative structures. The principal
object used for this purpose is the DataSet object.
GEO DataSets
Despite the variety of style and content of the data received,
submissions have a common core set of elements:
(i) sequence identity tracking information of each feature
on the array
(ii) normalized hybridization measurements
(iii) a description of the biological source used in each
hybridization
Using a combination of automated data extraction and
manual curation, this information is taken from the submitter-
supplied records and organized into an upper-level object
called a GEO DataSet. A DataSet represents a collection of
similarly-processed experimentally-related samples, summa-
rized and categorized according to experimental variables.
DataSets allow for the transformation of diverse styles of
incoming data from multiple unrelated projects, into a
relatively standardized format upon which downstream data
analysis and data display tools are based.
DataSets provide two discrete renderings of the data
(Figure 1):
(i) An experiment-centered representation that encapsula-
tes the entire study. This information is presented as
a DataSet record which comprises a synopsis of the
experiment, a breakdown of the experimental variables,
access to auxiliary objects, several data display and
analysis tools, and download options.
(ii) A gene-centered representation that presents quantitative
gene expression measurements for one gene across a
DataSet. This information is presented as a GEO Profile
which comprises gene identity annotation, DataSet title,
links to auxiliary information and a chart depicting the
expression level and rank of that gene across each sample
in the DataSet. Gene annotation is derived from querying
sequence identifiers (e.g. GenBank accessions, clone IDs)
with the latest Entrez Gene and UniGene databases, an
important point given the dynamic nature of gene
annotation.
SUBMISSION PROCEDURES, FORMATS AND
STANDARDS
We endeavor to make data deposit procedures as straight-
forward as possible. Submitters have several options for
data submission; selecting which method to use depends on
the amount and type of data to be submitted, and what format
the data are already in. Regardless of the deposit method
chosen, the final GEO records will look similar and contain
equivalent information. Each format captures all components
of the MIAME checklist, as well as any additional informa-
tion that the submitter wants to provide.
Upload options and formats
Web deposit. The web submission process is designed for
quick and easy deposit of individual records by occasional
submitters, or for smaller experiments. This route consists
of a set of interactive web forms that provide a simple
step-by-step procedure for deposit of data tables and
accompanying descriptive information.
SOFT format. Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT) is a
simple, line-based, tab-delimited format designed for rapid
batch deposit. A single SOFT file can hold both data tables
and accompanying descriptive information for multiple plat-
forms, samples and series records. The simplicity of SOFT
allows it to be readily generated from commonly-used data-
base and spreadsheet applications. Conveniently, two ver-
sions of SOFT are available:
SOFTtext. SOFT-formatted data are organized as concate-
nated records.
SOFTmatrix. SOFT-formatted data are organized side-
by-side as a matrix table, usually in an Excel spreadsheet.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue D761
MINiML format. MIAME Notation in Markup Language,
(MINiML, pronounced ‘minimal’) is a recent addition to
GEO’s upload/download options. MINiML is effectively an
XML rendering of SOFT format, and is similarly designed
for rapid batch submission and upload of data. The MINiML
XML schema definition and a detailed description are
available at the GEO website.
MAGE-ML format. MicroArray Gene Expression Markup
Language (MAGE-ML) is an XML format devised by
the MGED consortium (5) and a direct derivation from the
corresponding MAGE object model. GEO is not based on
the MAGE object model and cannot receive these files
directly. Nonetheless, parsers have been written to extract
data from some of the various flavors of MAGE-ML and
reformat according to GEO schema. It is worth noting here
that having data formatted as MAGE-ML does not in any
way imply MIAME-compliance. MIAME is a data content
standard, not a format standard. MIAME-compliant data
may be submitted in many formats.
Detailed documentation and examples of submission
options and formats are available on the GEO website. How-
ever, if submitters have questions or require assistance with
submission procedures they are encouraged to contact GEO
curation staff at geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for prompt support.
Submitters may keep their records private until a manu-
script describing the data is published. Submitters may gener-
ate read-only passwords that give reviewers and collaborators
confidential access to their private data.
Most researchers submit to GEO to support data discussed
in a journal manuscript, so it is important to present the data
as it was processed in the manuscript. However, over the past
two years, greater emphasis has been placed on provision
of raw, unmanipulated native data files to accompany the
processed data within GEO records. Such files include,
e.g. Affymetrix CEL or GenePix GPR scan files. Recent
modifications to submission procedures now make it more
convenient for submitters to supply these raw files: the web
deposit route specifically requests supplementary files; the
batch deposit routes allow for raw data files to be zipped/
tarred together with bulk submissions. Provision of raw
data not only enables other researchers to faithfully reproduce
the data selection, transformation and analysis steps that are
the basis of a publication, but also maximizes the long-term
value of submissions, enabling recycling of the data into
repeated rounds of analysis.
All submitted data undergo syntactic validation and are
inspected by curators for content integrity. When content
or format problems are identified, curators work with the
submitter until the issue is resolved. However, given the
huge diversity of biological themes, technology types, pro-
cessing techniques, and statistical transformations applied to
microarray data, it is impractical for curators to decisively
determine the accuracy, validity or score the degree of
MIAME-compliance of submitted data. Thus, researchers
are ultimately responsible for the completeness, quality and
accuracy of their submissions. This validation process can
benefit from feedback by journal editorial reviewers or
funding agency enforcement. Through their GEO accounts,
researchers retain full editorial control of their records and
can update or edit their records at any time.

In addition to satisfying possible journal requirements for
publication, there are other significant benefits to depositing
data with GEO. Data receive long term archiving at a cen-
tralized repository, integration with other NCBI resources
which afford greatly increased usability and visibility, as
well as possible links back to submitters’ own project
websites.
TOOLS TO RETRIEVE, EXPLORE AND
VIZUALIZE DATA
To maximize the utility and value of the massive volumes of
data in GEO, a selection of intuitive tools and features has
been developed to assist researchers to quickly locate,
analyze and visualize data relevant to their interests. These
features incorporate traditional data reduction techniques and
concise displays designed for human scanning, helping the
user identify and categorize gene and sample relationships.
Figure 2 depicts a schematic overview of the query workflow
and how the various features and tools are interlinked. A
summary of where the main features are located and their
purpose is provided in Table 1. Query approaches include
standard text-based searches, sequence-based searches, min-
ing based on expression behavior characteristics or combi-
nations of these factors.
These tools do not require specialized knowledge of micro-
array analysis methods, nor do they require time-consuming
download or processing of large data sets. However, it should
be stated that the analysis features are not primarily intended
for robust systematic data mining. The diverse nature of the
data in GEO restricts to some extent the statistical tools
that can be developed. All data are treated similarly; criteria
such as scaling factors, filter parameters, and number of
repeats are not considered. Despite these issues, these tools
are extremely useful for quick and easy identification of
relevant and noteworthy data.
NCBI’s Entrez search system serves as the basis for most
queries. Entrez GEO DataSets contains experiment-centered
data and Entrez GEO Profiles contains gene-centered data.
Most biologists are familiar with Entrez, using it routinely
to search other NCBI databases like PubMed and GenBank
(6,7). It has a straightforward interface where users can
locate relevant material by simply typing in keywords or
Boolean phrases restricted to supported attribute fields.
Examples of typical queries and query fields are provided
at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/qqtutorial.
html.
Full use is made of Entrez’s powerful linking capabilities.
Intra-database links connect genes related by expression
pattern or sequence. Where possible, reciprocal inter-
database links connect GEO data with related data in other
NCBI resources such as PubMed, GenBank, Gene, UniGene,
MapViewer, OMIM and others. Advanced Entrez features
allow generation of complex multipart queries or combi-
nation of multiple queries that find common intersections
in retrievals. GEO’s Entrez query facilities were recently
further enhanced by implementation of a spell-check func-
tion, as well as automatic term mapping using MeSH trans-
lation tables.
Graphics are an important tool to aid visualization
and interpretation of high-dimensional expression data. The
expression pattern of each gene within a DataSet is repre-
sented as a profile chart (Figure 1D). A breakdown of the

experimental design is provided along the bottom of the
chart, helping the user to quickly assess whether expression
levels are shifting with experimental variables. Thumbnail
chart images provided on batch profile retrievals are useful
for rapid batch profile scanning and comparison. Value distri-
bution charts are provided on DataSets records, providing
at-a-glance indication of how well normalized the data are
within a DataSet. Precomputed interactive hierarchical cluster
heat map images are available on each DataSet record,
providing suggestions for groups of coordinately regulated
genes within entire DataSets.
Within the last year, the back-end structure of the
Profiles, DataSets and annotation databases was completely
redesigned. These changes allow more flexibility on the
front-end user interfaces and will permit development of
more advanced query, analysis and download tools, includ-
ing enhanced Entrez utilities user-scripting options. These
changes also help to streamline internal indexing procedu-
res, enabling more frequent release of new DataSets and
profiles.
For users who prefer to use their own analysis software
or want to perform more robust analyses, all GEO data are
available for bulk download via anonymous FTP at ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/. Files include SOFT- and
MINiML-formatted Platform and Series families, SOFT-
formatted DataSets and original supplementary data types.
Various software packages have been developed by the com-
munity to handle GEO data formats, including the GEOquery
R/BioConductor package, http://bioconductor.org/packages/
release/bioc/html/GEOquery.html.
CONCLUSIONS
GEO currently represents the largest single resource for
public gene expression data. Beyond archiving and making
data freely-available for peer review and download, the GEO
repository also provides an extensive complement of utilities
and strategies that enable effective data mining on either a
small or large scale.
The data in GEO gain value as they accumulate. Pooling
masses of expression data into common formats at a
single location affords researchers the opportunity to distill
disparate data sets and identify common gene expression
trends, dissect regulatory networks and predict functions of
uncharacterized genes. Increasingly, GEO data are used and
cited by third parties as evidence to support and complement
their own studies, selected examples include (8–15).
Having GEO data cross-annotated with extensive sequence,
mapping and bibliographic resources via the NCBI Entrez
system of interlinked databases imparts further value and
context to the data. This diverse integrated data environment
leverages multiple types of information and enables tradi-
tional disciplinary boundaries to be crossed, ultimately accel-
erating systems-level hypothesis formation and scientific
discovery.
Future plans for GEO include continued development of
data retrieval and mining features, and enhancing novice
user experience. We also plan to improve rendering and
representation of the non-gene-expression data types that
GEO accepts, which include chromatin-immunoprecipitation
on arrays (ChIP-chip) studies, array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH), SNP arrays and some proteomic data.
