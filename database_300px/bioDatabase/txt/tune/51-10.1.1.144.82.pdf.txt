[1] Inclusion of isoprene as a source of secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) in a global model increases the global burden
of SOA from all sources by more than a factor of two. The
isoprene source substantially increases SOA concentrations
in the free troposphere, because isoprene, and, more
importantly, isoprene’s oxidation products, have much
greater concentrations at higher altitudes than other
biogenic SOA precursors, highlighting the importance of
semi-volatile organics for SOA formation. These results are
robust with respect to increases in partitioning of non-
isoprene oxidation products at higher altitudes and
increased wet removal of isoprene oxidation products.
This additional source of SOA enhances production of SOA
from other parent hydrocarbons by 17%, and leads to an
overall distribution of SOA that differs enough from
previous predictions to warrant reevaluation of
the radiative effects of organic carbon aerosol.

[2] Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed when ox-
idized products of volatile hydrocarbons condense, often
comprises a substantial portion of the organic mass fraction
of atmospheric aerosols. The prevalence of organic carbon
aerosol on a global scale makes identifying significant
sources of SOA an important task, as carbonaceous aerosol
is known to strongly influence air quality and climate
change. Model predictions of organic carbon aerosol con-
centrations have exhibited a low bias not present in coinci-
dent predictions of black (elemental) carbon, with this bias
being attributed to under-prediction of SOA [Heald et al.,
2005; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2003].
[3] Isoprene (C5H8) is the second most abundant hydro-
carbon emitted into the Earth’s atmosphere after methane
(500 Tg yr1 [Guenther et al., 1995]). Although it has
long been assumed that all its products remain in the gas
phase, if isoprene were to yield even a small amount of
aerosol, this would have a profound effect on global sources
of organic aerosol. Biogenic volatile organic compounds
other than isoprene, such as terpenes and sesquiterpenes, are
presently believed to be the largest source of SOA mass on
a global scale, with model estimates of the magnitudes of
these sources ranging from 12–70 Tg yr1 [Kanakidou et
al., 2005]. Recent laboratory chamber studies of isoprene
photooxidation show that SOA yields are 1–2% at high
NOx levels [Kroll et al., 2005] and 3% at low NOx levels
[Kroll et al., 2006]. Furthermore, organic aerosol collected
in forested areas is strongly indicative of an isoprene
precursor [Claeys et al., 2004a, 2004b; Ion et al., 2005;
Kourtchev et al., 2005; Matsunaga et al., 2003]. The impact
of such a potentially large source of carbonaceous aerosol
necessitates careful investigation of the fate of isoprene
oxidation products on a global scale.
[4] Claeys et al. [2004b] estimated SOA production from
isoprene to be 2 Tg yr1 by simply multiplying an estimate
of global isoprene emissions by an observed yield of
condensed polyols from isoprene; subsequent recognition
of additional SOA production pathways increases this
estimate [Claeys et al., 2004a]. Cloud processing of iso-
prene oxidation products alone has been calculated to con-
tribute 1.6 Tg yr1 of SOA [Lim et al., 2005]. Matsunaga et
al. [2005] estimated a source of SOA from isoprene in the
range of 10–120 Tg yr1; however, this study neglects the
effects of temperature and background organic particulate
matter concentrations on gas - particle partitioning, factors
known to strongly influence SOA formation.
[5] Recent availability of data from laboratory chamber
studies of isoprene oxidation [Kroll et al., 2005, 2006]
allows us to now assess the global SOA forming potential
of isoprene in a more fundamental manner. Several factors
influence SOA formation, such as the ambient NOx con-
centration, RO2 concentration, temperature, and heteroge-
neous reactions [Limbeck et al., 2003; Czoschke et al.,
2003; Edney et al., 2005; Kroll et al., 2006]. Until the
mechanisms that govern these types of behavior are pre-
cisely known one must use empirical parameterizations
based on actual laboratory data [Kanakidou et al., 2005].
[6] For inclusion of SOA in global models, the frame-
work of the two-product model [Odum et al., 1996; Seinfeld
and Pankow, 2003] provides a method for predicting the
formation of SOA based upon empirical parameters deter-
mined from laboratory chamber studies even when the exact
chemical nature of the aerosol products, or even the inter-
mediate gas-phase oxidation products, are not known
[Griffin et al., 1999b]. The model describes the oxidation
of a parent hydrocarbon to produce two representative gas-
phase products with stoichiometric coefficients a1 and a2.
Subsequent partitioning of these products into the aerosol
phase is governed by the availability of pre-existing organic
aerosol and by their equilibrium partitioning coefficients,
K1, K2, taking into account the temperature dependence of
the partitioning coefficients using the Clausius-Clapyeron
equation. At the moment condensation onto other (non-
organic) aerosol species is not considered, though this
would afford increased SOA formation from all species
[Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2003].
[7] We simulate global SOA formation using the chem-
ical transport model GEOS-Chem (version 7.2.4 with a
horizontal resolution of 4  5 and 30 layers up to
0.01 hPa, GEOS-3 meteorological fields [Park et al.,
2004]), previously implemented with a gas-particle parti-

tioning model of SOA formation from terpenes [Chung and
Seinfeld, 2002; Heald et al., 2005], updated here to include
formation of SOA from oxidation of isoprene using param-
eters shown in Table 1. The a’s and K’s were derived from
the final amount of SOA formed in chamber studies of
isoprene oxidation by OH [Kroll et al., 2006] using the
same method as Griffin et al. [1999a]. We assume reaction
with OH is the only pathway for formation of SOA from
isoprene. Though reaction with O3 or NO3 may also lead to
SOA formation, the magnitudes of these sources are as-
sumed to be minor, because an order of magnitude more
isoprene reacts with OH than with O3 or NO3 on a global
scale [Calvert et al., 2000]. We assign a molecular weight of
130 for the oxidation products from isoprene, which is that
of tetrol, a compound prevalent in SOA that originates from
isoprene [Claeys et al., 2004b].
[8] An issue with empirical partitioning models is that the
conditions of the chamber studies from which the yield
parameters are derived may not be representative of atmo-
spheric conditions. The main concern has been that NOx
levels in these experiments tend to be larger than those in
the troposphere. The experiments used to derive the yield
parameters for isoprene given here were carried out under
low NOx concentrations (<1 ppb) and at cooler temperatures
more relevant to tropospheric conditions [Kroll et al., 2006].
Still, a single set of yield parameters may not fully represent
SOA formation throughout the entire range of conditions
present in the atmosphere—further laboratory and modeling
studies are required to explicitly specify the dependence the
SOA yield parameters on the chemical environment.
[9] Implementation of this model on global scales
requires knowledge of thermophysical parameters that are
not easily determined experimentally. The enthalpy of
vaporization of SOA, DHv, is critical for extrapolating the
equilibrium gas-particle partition coefficients to colder tem-
peratures [Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2003]. The value of
DHv depends upon the nature of the SOA and how it was
formed [Offenberg et al., 2006], though there is not yet
enough experimental data available to justify the use of
more than a single value of DHv for all SOA. The base case
value of DHv used here, 42 kJ mol
1 [Chung and Seinfeld,
2002], originally considered a lower estimate in comparison
to values from similar studies which ranged as high as
156 kJ mol1, is perhaps in fact quite reasonable, as recent
experimental studies of the temperature dependence of SOA
formed from a-pinene have placed DHv closer to the lower
estimates [Offenberg et al., 2006; C. O. Stanier and S. N.
Pandis, Measurements of the volatility of aerosols from
alpha-pinene ozonolysis, submitted to Environmental Sci-
ence and Technology, 2006]. The sensitivity of SOA pre-
dictions to the aqueous solubility of the oxidation product
species, governed by an estimated average Henry’s law
constant of the oxidation products, H, has also been
mentioned by Tsigaridis and Kanakidou [2003], though
the consequences of variations in H on global SOA pre-
dictions have not yet been explored. Loss of these products
by wet removal depends strongly on H. Given that polyols
resulting from isoprene oxidation are more soluble than
many of the previously identified species in SOA, which
were taken to have an average Henry’s law constant of
105 M atm1 (R. Sander, Compilation of Henry’s law
constants for inorganic and organic species of potential
importance in environmental chemistry (version 3), http://
www.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/sander/res/henry.html), we
consider the effect of increasing the Henry’s law constant
of the oxidation products to 106 M atm1, and, for com-
parison, decreasing it to 104 M atm1.
[10] Model predictions of global yearly average SOA
concentrations for the year March 2001–February 2002
are shown in Figure 1. We select this time period because
it encompasses the ACE-Asia campaign, for which the
observed amount of organic carbon aerosol in the free
troposphere exceeds predictions by the base case model
by a factor of 10–100 [Heald et al., 2005]. Figures 1a
and 1c show the total concentrations of SOA generated by
the existing (base case) biogenic VOCs (terpenes and
OVOCs) at the surface and at 5.2 km, respectively. Figures
1b and 1d show total SOA concentrations when isoprene is
included as an additional source of SOA. The difference
between these two simulations is striking, most notably in
the magnitude of the increases in the free troposphere,
where typically more than 70% of the SOA is from
isoprene. SOA concentrations increase by a factor of 1.5
to 3 in regions of relatively high SOA concentrations, and
they increase by more than a factor of 10 in remote marine
regions where SOA concentrations are small (<0.01 mg
m3), such as the Indian and South Central Pacific oceans.
[11] The yearly average total SOA burden (BT) and the
net yearly SOA production (PT) are given in Table 2, where
the total production is also broken down into contributions
from isoprene (PI) and from the original set of VOCs (PO).
The amount of SOA produced directly from isoprene is

the year March 2001–Feb 2002 (a) at the surface without

6.2 Tg yr1, almost as large as the original SOA source in
the base calculation, 8.7 Tg yr1. The presence of this much
additional organic substrate enhances SOA formation from
other sources by 17%. The total SOA burden more than
doubles, and the lifetime of the SOA from isoprene (13.5 d)
is twice that of the base case SOA (6.7 d). Results from a
one month simulation with model resolution of 2  2.5
were equivalent.
[12] Two factors give rise to the distinct distributions and
lifetimes of the SOA formed from isoprene compared to the
base case set of VOCs. Emissions of isoprene are generally
much greater. As a result, isoprene is not completely
oxidized near its sources, and substantial amounts of iso-
prene can be lofted to much greater altitudes. Also, gas-
particle partitioning of the isoprene oxidation products is
shifted less toward the particle phase than that of the
products of the base case VOCs; hence, the lifetime of the
isoprene oxidation products is also greater. The combined
effect of these factors increases SOA precursor concentra-
tions in the free troposphere where partitioning to the
aerosol phase is enhanced owing to lower temperatures,
leading to formation of SOA in regions where there was
little in the base case. Although this increase alone is not
enough to account for the discrepancy between predicted
and observed tropospheric organic carbon aerosol in the
region studied during the ACE-Asia campaign [Heald et al.,
2005], it does significantly impact our global picture of
organic carbon aerosol distributions.
[13] The total amount of isoprene predicted to be oxi-
dized by OH is 209 Tg yr1; the global isoprene SOA
‘‘yield’’ is 2.9%, which is essentially the same as those from
the low-NOx chamber experiments (3%). We find that
simply calculating the formation of SOA from isoprene
from a direct calculation (wherein SOA is formed, irrevers-
ibly, as a constant percentage of the amount of isoprene that
reacts) leads to lower SOA burdens than the two-product
model, in contrast to previous studies comparing these
methods [Lack et al., 2004; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou,
2003]. The reason for this discrepancy is, as noted earlier,
a significant portion of the SOA from isoprene is formed
from the semivolatile oxidation products that only condense
substantially at lower temperatures, an effect that may not
be as critical for modeling SOA from sources with greater
yields.
[14] We examine SOA levels predicted by the base case
model (without isoprene as a source of SOA) when using a
reasonably larger value of DHv = 50 kJ mol
1 or when H =
104 M atm1. Use of this value of DHv leads to a modest
increase in the global SOA burden of 0.08 Tg, and average
SOA concentrations in the troposphere increase by a factor
of 2 to 3. Decreasing H increases the burden by almost 40%.
While these are substantial consequences, the overall mag-
nitude of these effects is still small compared to increases of
SOA concentrations from isoprene, as shown in Figure 2.
When isoprene is included as a source of SOA, increasing H
to 106 M atm1 has little overall effect, as the oxidation
products are effectively completely soluble beyond H 
105 M atm1.
[15] Including isoprene as a source of SOA causes
substantial increases in predicted SOA concentrations, par-
ticularly in the free troposphere and remote marine environ-
ments. A detailed comparison with measured organic
carbon aerosol is now in order. This source of SOA may
help explain observations of organic carbon aerosol, noted
previously to be under-predicted by this (and others) model
in these regions [Heald et al., 2005; Tsigaridis and
Kanakidou, 2003], particularly considering recent revisions
in estimates of isoprene emissions [Guenther et al., 2006].
This study highlights the need for further research into the
chemical fate of the oxidation products of isoprene [Kroll et
al., 2006] and the importance of developing SOA models
that can explicitly represent condensation of oxidation
products normally considered too volatile to contribute to
organic aerosol formation [Donahue et al., 2006]. These
results may have implications for climate change given the
magnitude of the predicted top of the atmosphere radiative
forcing of organic carbon in year 2100 climate [Liao et al.,
2006].
