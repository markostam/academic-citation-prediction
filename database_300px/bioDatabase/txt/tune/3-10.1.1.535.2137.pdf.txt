ABSTRACT
Human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (hOgg1)
excises 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) from
damaged DNA. We report a pre-steady-state kinetic
analysis of hOgg1 mechanism using stopped-
flow and enzyme fluorescence monitoring. The
kinetic scheme for hOgg1 processing an 8-oxoG:C-
containing substrate was found to include at least
three fast equilibrium steps followed by two slow,
irreversible steps and another equilibrium step. The
second irreversible step was rate-limiting overall.
By comparing data from Ogg1 intrinsic fluorescence
traces and from accumulation of products of different
types, the irreversible steps were attributed to two
main chemical steps of the Ogg1-catalyzed reaction:
cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond of the damaged
nucleotide and b-elimination of its 30-phosphate.
The fast equilibrium steps were attributed to enzyme
conformational changes during the recognition of
8-oxoG, and the final equilibrium, to binding of the
reaction product by the enzyme. hOgg1 interacted
with a substrate containing an aldehydic AP site
very slowly, but the addition of 8-bromoguanine
(8-BrG) greatly accelerated the reaction, which was
best described by two initial equilibrium steps fol-
lowed by one irreversible chemical step and a final
product release equilibrium step. The irreversible
step may correspond to b-elimination since it is
the very step facilitated by 8-BrG.
INTRODUCTION
Oxidative stress, both of environmental and metabolic origin,
presents an ongoing challenge for cellular DNA (1).
Nucleobases and deoxyribose are both prone to oxidation,
which generates a number of different lesions (2–4). The most
common purine base redox lesions in vivo are 8-oxoguanine
(8-oxoG) (Figure 1), 8-oxoadenine, 4,5-diamino-5-formami-
dopyrimidine (FapyAde) (derived from adenine) and
2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua)
(derived from guanine) (5). Incorporation of inappropriate
nucleotides by DNA polymerases opposite these lesions results
in their considerable mutagenicity (6–9). To counteract this
damage, many organisms possess a three-component enzym-
atic system (termed ‘GO system’ after 8-oxoG), shown to
reduce mutagenesis by 8-oxoG (10,11) and possibly by other
oxidized purines. The GO system of Escherichia coli consists
of three enzymes, 8-oxodGTPase (MutT), mismatched aden-
ine DNA glycosylase (MutY) and 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase
(Fpg or MutM). MutT prevents incorporation of 8-oxoG to
DNA from the pool of oxidized dGTP, Fpg removes 8-oxoG
from 8-oxoG:C pairs, and MutY removes adenine from
A:8-oxoG pairs, which could only arise in DNA after a mis-
incorporation event (10,11). A fully functional GO system
decreases the rate of spontaneous mutagenesis 250-fold in
E.coli (12).
Most eukaryotes have homologues of MutT (13) and MutY
(14). However, the major eukaryotic 8-oxoG-DNA glyc-
osylase, Ogg1, is not homologous to bacterial Fpg (15,16).
Ogg1 belongs to a superfamily of endonuclease III-like DNA
glycosylases possessing conserved structural helix–hairpin–
helix and G/P . . . D-loop motifs (17,18), whereas Fpg is a
prototypic member of another DNA repair enzyme superfam-
ily characterized by the presence of a helix–two turn–helix
motif and a Cys4 zinc finger (19,20). Because of these struc-
tural differences, Ogg1 and Fpg also differ in the nature of
nucleophiles used to initiate base excision (21,22) in the
type of the break left in DNA after base excision (15) and
in steady-state reaction kinetics (23,24). In addition, the sub-
strate specificities of these two enzymes overlap only partially
(23–27), the main difference being that FapyAde is not a

substrate for Ogg1. However, enzymes homologous and
structurally similar to Fpg (e.g. endonuclease VIII) or Ogg1
(e.g. endonuclease III) can have quite different substrate
specificities despite all the similarities (28).
Ogg1 is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing DNA glyc-
osylase activity (hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of the
damaged nucleotide) and AP lyase activity (elimination
of the 30-phosphate, often referred to as b-elimination). Unlike
the situation in several other bifunctional DNA glycosylases,
the AP lyase activity of Ogg1 is much weaker than its
glycosylase activity (24,29). Consequently, two products of
Ogg1-catalyzed reaction can be detected: the glycosylase
activity quickly produces abasic (AP) sites, and a slower
AP lyase activity leaves nicked DNA with the nick flanked
by a 50-phosphate and a 30-terminal a,b-unsaturated aldehyde.
If Ogg1 is presented with an AP site-containing substrate,
the rate of its cleavage is similar to the rate of b-elimination
of a damaged base-containing substrate (24). This rate can be
significantly elevated if the reaction mixture contains guanine
derivatives substituted with an electron-withdrawing group
at C8, such as 8-bromoguanine (8-BrG), which probably acts
as a cofactor promoting dissociation of a proton at C20 (30).
It is being increasingly realized that the substrate specific-
ity of DNA- or RNA-dependent enzymes depends not only on
the structural features of the Michaelis complex, but also on
the other points along the reaction coordinate (31–34).
Whether a given lesion will be recognized and excised by a
DNA glycosylase may depend on the series of conformational
changes in both the enzyme and DNA molecule that start at
the moment of the enzyme binding to unspecific DNA and
bring the reacting moieties to positions permitting the act
of catalysis; different steps of the reaction coordinate may
be ‘bottlenecks’ at which non-substrates are discriminated
against (31,33–35).
Recently, pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of E.coli Fpg
acting on undamaged DNA, 8-oxoG, a natural AP site and
an uncleavable tetrahydrofuran analogue of an AP site (F) has
been reported (36,37). To address the question whether a
structurally different enzyme uses similar or different mech-
anisms in recognizing and processing the same lesion, we now
extend this analysis to human Ogg1 using the same set of
substrates. The results reported here suggest that, although
Ogg1 uses a generally quite different kinetic scheme to recog-
nize and excise 8-oxoG, some steps are remarkably similar
between Ogg1 and Fpg, supporting the idea that lesion recog-
nition strongly depends on its nature. In addition, we invest-
igate the kinetic mechanism of stimulation of AP lyase activity
of Ogg1 by 8-BrG and show that the stimulation results from
an increase in the rate of b-elimination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials, oligonucleotides, enzymes and bacterial
strains
Chemicals were mostly from Sigma–Aldrich (St Louis, MO).
8-BrG was synthesized according to a published procedure
(38). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides for stopped-flow experi-
ments (Figure 1) were prepared as described previously (36,37).
PCR primers were made by Sigma–Genosys (Woodlands, TX),
purifiedby20%PAGEanddesaltedusingSepPakreverse-phase
cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). Vector pET-15b DNA and
E.coli BL21(DE3) cells were from Novagen (Madison, WI).
Restriction endonuclease XhoI, T4 polynucleotide kinase
and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly,
MA); restriction endonuclease Bpu1102I and Pfu DNA
polymerase were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). [g-32P]ATP
(>3000 Ci/mmol) was from Biosan (Novosibirsk, Russia).
Cloning of hOgg1 for overexpression
To make a construct for overexpression of the main hOgg1
isoform, hOgg1-1a, its full-length coding sequence was PCR-
amplified from human testis QUICK-Clone cDNA (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA) using the primers d(CGAGACCTCGAGCCT-
GCCCGCGCGCTTCTGCC) (carries a XhoI restriction site)
and d(CGAGACGCTCAGCCTAGCCTTCCGGCCCTTTGG)
(carries aBpu1102I restrictionsite). Thirty cycles ofPCR(1min
at 94C, 1 min at 60C and 2 min at 72C) were performed
with Pfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Of the two bands visible after resolution of the
products by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, one (1 kb long) is
expected to correspond to the 1a isoform of hOgg1, and the other
(1.3 kb long) to the 1b isoform. The 1 kb fragment was extracted
using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA),
digested with Bpu1102I and XhoI, purified by MiniElute PCR
purification (Qiagen) and ligated into pET-15b vector digested
with the same enzymes. Ligation products were electroporated
into E.coli DH5a cells using an E.coli Pulser (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The
sequence of the insert, confirmed by direct sequencing, was
found to be identical to the published data (16). The
construct, termed phOgg11aNHis, expresses a full-length
hOgg1-1a protein tagged at the N-terminus with a hexahistidine
oligopeptide followed by a linker of 13 amino acid residues. The
protein terminates at the native C-terminus of hOgg1-1a.
Purification of hOgg1
To purify hOgg1 expressed as a recombinant protein in E.coli,
2 litres of E.coli BL21(DE3) carrying the phOgg11aNHis
construct were grown in YT·2 broth with 50 mg/ml ampicillin
at 37C until A600 = 0.6–0.7, then shifted to 30C and induced
overnight with 0.2 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside.
The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in
lysis buffer (40 ml of 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA)
supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and
incubated with lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at room
temperature. Incubation was continued for a further 30 min
after the addition of NaCl to 1 M. Lysis was then completed by

of oligonucleotides used.

sonicating the suspension on ice using an UZDN-2T ultra-
sound dispergator (SELMI, Ukraine), with 10 pulses of 30 s
at the highest power setting, with a 90 s interval between
pulses. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (12 000 g,
4C, 30 min) and diluted with 4 vol of Buffer A (25 mM
potassium phosphate, pH 7.4). The resulting solution was
applied to a column of Fractogel EMD SO3
 650 (Merck,
50 ml packed bed volume) equilibrated in Buffer A with
200 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 120 ml of the
equilibration buffer. Then, the column outlet was connected to
a 5 ml HiTrap Chelating column (Pharmacia) charged with
Ni2+, and the whole system was washed with Buffer A con-
taining 1 M NaCl. The chelating column was then disconnec-
ted, washed with Buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl and
50 mM imidazole, and the hexahistidine-tagged polypeptides
were eluted in Buffer A with 500 mM NaCl and 500 mM
imidazole. The eluate was diluted 10-fold with Buffer A
and applied to a 5 ml HiTrap heparin column (Pharmacia)
equilibrated in Buffer A with 200 mM NaCl. The column
was developed with a gradient of 200–800 mM NaCl in
Buffer A; the fractions absorbing at 280 nm were collected,
supplemented with DTT to 1 mM and analyzed by 12% dis-
continuous gel electrophoresis (Laemmli system). Fractions
containing a band of the expected mobility (typically 20 ml)
were pooled, dialyzed against two changes of 250 ml of 25 mM
potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol and stored at 20C. The enzyme
was electrophoretically homogeneous.
Stopped-flow experiments
The experiments were conducted and numerical values for
kinetic constants extracted as described previously for Fpg
protein (37), except that fluorescent traces were obtained for
times up to 1000 s. All experiments were carried out at 25C
in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DDT and 9% glycerol (v/v). A model
SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics
Ltd, Leatherhead, UK) fitted with a 150 W Xe arc lamp and
2 mm pathlength optical cell was used with excitation at
283 nm. Fluorescence emission from enzyme Trp residues
was observed through a 320 nm long-pass filter. The dead
time of the instrument was 1.4 ms. Only data at times
>2 ms were used for calculation. hOgg1 in one syringe was
rapidly mixed with a solution of the substrate in the other
syringe. The concentration of hOgg1 in the reaction chamber
after mixing in all experiments was 1.0 mM, and concentra-
tions of ODN substrates were varied in the range 0.25–3.0 mM.
Typically, each trace shown is the average of four or more
individual experiments; reported rate constants represent the
mean (with standard deviation) of such datasets.
Bleaching of enzyme fluorescence
When a solution of hOgg1 was mixed with buffer, fluorescence
bleaching was observed. For the correction of the measured
data, the fluorescence intensities were recalculated using
Equation 1:
F ¼ ðFobs  FbÞ · expðkb · tÞ þ Fb 1
where F is the corrected fluorescence intensity, Fobs is
the observed fluorescence intensity, Fb is the background
fluorescence, and kb is the coefficient determined for each
substrate concentration in experiments with non-cleaved
substrates.
Inner filter effect
F-values in the presence of ODN substrates were also correc-
ted for the inner filter effect due to ODN absorption at 293 nm
using the following equation:
Fc ¼ F · 100:5·Aex 2
where Fc is the fluorescence intensity at the particular wave-
length, corrected both for bleaching and the inner filter effect,
and Aex is the absorbance of the ODNs at 293 nm.
Kinetic data analysis
Global non-linear least-squares fitting was performed using
DynaFit software (BioKin Ltd) (39). Differential equations
were written for each species in the mechanisms described
in Schemes 1–4 (see Results), and the stopped-flow fluores-
cence traces were directly fit by expressing the corrected fluor-
escence intensity (Fc) at any reaction time t as the sum of the
background fluorescence (Fb) and the fluorescence intensities
of each protein species:
Fc ¼ Fb þ
Xn
i¼0
FiðtÞ 3
where Fi(t) = fi(Ei(t)), fi are the coefficients of specific fluor-
escence for each discernible hOgg1 conformer, and (Ei(t)) are
the concentrations of the conformers at any given time t (i = 0
relates to the free protein; i > 0 relates to the protein–DNA
complexes) These specific fluorescence coefficients describe
only the part of fluorescence that changes due to DNA binding.
Fluorescence titration of hOgg1 with oligonucleotide
ligands under stationary conditions
Each point on the fluorescence titration curves was obtained
by measurement of the fluorescence intensity of separate
solutions (80 ml) containing hOgg1 (1 · 106 M) and oligo-
nucleotide ligand at the required concentration in a binding
buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM DTT and 9% glycerol). The mixtures were incubated at
25C for 2 min. Fluorescence spectra were measured at the
excitation wavelength of 283 nm using an SFM 25 spectro-
fluorometer (Kontron Instruments, Italy) in minimum time
possible to avoid bleaching. Values of fluorescence intensity
at the emission maximum (333 nm) were used to calculate the
association constants according to the equations:

Product analysis
To analyze products formed by Ogg1, the substrate oligonuc-
leotides were 50-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase
and [g-32P]ATP, and the reaction was performed under the
conditions described above. The products were precipitated by
adding 10 vol of 2% LiClO4/acetone solution. The precipitates
were washed three times with 100 ml of acetone, dried, dis-
solved in water (4 ml) and formamide dye loading buffer (3 ml),
and analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE. The gels exposed
on Agfa CP-BU X-ray film (Agfa-Geavert, Belgium), and the
autoradiograms were scanned and quantified using Gel-Pro
Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, USA).
Structural analysis
To analyze the movement of Trp residues between two
adjacent Ogg1 structures, protein parts of the structures were
superimposed for the best fit of their backbones, and the root-
mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) was calculated for the side
chains of the individual Trp residues using Swiss-PdbViewer
v3.7 (40). Water-accessible surfaces of individual Trp residues
were calculated using GETAREA 1.1 (41).
RESULTS
Ogg1 fluorescence changes due to substrate binding
Time-dependent stopped-flow experiments were carried out
using dodecamer duplex substrates containing a single lesion
at the sixth position from the 50 end of the modified strand
(Figure 1). Such duplexes are stable under the conditions
used (36,37). The footprint of Ogg1, as judged from its crystal
structure in a complex with DNA, does not exceed 9–10 bp
(30,42,43). The terminal effects on Ogg1 kinetics are negli-
gible when the lesion is located 5 bp away from any terminus
(D. O. Zharkov, unpublished data). Fluorescence spectra of
Ogg1 in the absence and presence of non-specific duplex were
measured under equilibrium conditions. Binding to the duplex
caused a change in the enzyme fluorescence (data not shown),
confirming that direct internal tryptophan fluorescence could be
used to monitor the reaction progress in stopped-flow experi-
ments.
Binding of Ogg1 to DNA duplexes containing G:C,
F:C and AP:C
To obtain a reference base for the analysis of Ogg1 interactions
with substrates containing lesions, we first investigated bind-
ing of Ogg1 to an undamaged dsODN of the same sequence.
As shown in Figure 2, the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of Ogg1
showed a slow decrease over a 10 s time range. The fluores-
cence traces for G:C and F:C duplexes showed rather low
signal-to-noise ratio, making their quantitative processing
not very reliable. Fitting the data for AP:C to the one-site
binding model (36) gave estimates for the forward and reverse
rate constants of Ogg1 binding to an AP:C substrate of
4.6 · 105 M1 s1 and 0.11 s1, respectively, corresponding
to an equilibrium dissociation constant KESf = 2.4 · 107 M.
(Throughout the paper, rate or equilibrium constants determ-
ined in the stopped-flow experiments are denoted by subscript
index ‘f’, those determined in fluorescence titration experi-
ments, by subscript index ‘t’, and the constants determined in
electrophoresis experiments, by subscript index ‘e’. Substrates
for which the constants were determined are shown as super-
script indexes, if necessary.)
For the AP:C ligand, such a result was rather unexpected,
since Ogg1 has been reported to process such substrates by
b-elimination, albeit not very efficiently (24,29). Nevertheless,
it is evident from Figure 2 that though there is no significant

processing of the AP:C substrate, the enzyme binds natural AP
sites tightly enough.
Interaction of Ogg1 with 8-oxoG:C-containing duplexes
In contrast to the three dsODN ligands described above, the
duplex containing an 8-oxoG:C pair showed more complex
fluorescence dynamics (Figure 3A). At least five discernible
fluorescence change steps could be observed in the fluores-
cence traces. The reaction rate of mammalian Ogg1 is known
to be limited by the product release step (24,44), and the rate of
the Ogg1-catalyzed AP lyase reaction is notably lower than
that of the glycosylase reaction (24). Accordingly, processing
of the 8-oxoG:C-containing substrate by Ogg1 was described
in Scheme 1.
The values for individual kinetic constants were determined
by global fitting (Table 1). Equilibrium constants for the first
three steps, as well as the overall association constant, can be
calculated from these data as K1f = 2.0 · 106 M1, K2f =
11.5 M1 and K3f = 0.17 M1 (overall KAf = 2.9 · 107 M1).

literature data on slow cleavage of the nascent AP site and
slow product release by mammalian Ogg1 (24), the full reac-
tion scheme (Scheme 1a) could possibly contain, after the
initial three binding equilibria and two irreversible (chemical)
steps, one equilibrium step corresponding to product release,
characterized by the dissociation constant KEP.
To determine the equilibrium constant KEP, if any, for pro-
duct binding and release, we performed fluorescent titration
of hOgg1. Since the true reaction product (containing a nick in
DNA flanked by an a,b-unsaturated aldehyde at its 50-side
and a phosphate at the 30-side) was hard to obtain in the
required amounts, we instead used a dsODN containing a
single-nucleotide gap flanked by two phosphates as a product
analog:
CpTpCpTpCp pCpCpTpTpCpC
GpApGpApGpCpGpGpApApGpG
A single transition was observed at melting temperature,
Tm = 20.8C in a melting curve of this ternary ODN system,
indicating that less than a half of the complex would still be
present under our experimental conditions (25C). Thus, we
titrated hOgg1 with an equimolar mixture of the three ODNs
composing the gapped duplex and registered changes in the
maximum of fluorescence spectrum of the protein. The res-
ulting KEPt value, 0.88 · 106 M (corrected for the total con-
centration of individual ODNs), approximates the true product
equilibrium constant, which is also likely to be influenced
by the presence of a 4-hydroxy-2-pentenal moiety in the true
product.
In stopped-flow experiments with detection based on
changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of protein mole-
cules, only events associated with conformational changes in
the Trp-containing enzyme parts could be detected. To assign
discernible fluorescence changes to particular chemical steps
of the Ogg1-catalyzed reaction, we used PAGE to follow the
time course of accumulation of the abasic product (revealed by
alkaline treatment of the reaction mixture) and of the nicked
product during processing of 8-oxoG:C-containing duplex
by Ogg1 (Figure 3B). The general association constant was
calculated from fluorescence traces as KA = K1 + K1K2 +
K1K2K3 (where K1, K2 and K3 are the equilibrium constants
for the first three reversible steps in Scheme 1), and this value
(2.9 · 107 M1) was used for fitting the data on the accumu-
lation of abasic product to Scheme 2.
From this scheme, k2e was calculated as 0.08 s
1. Then,
using the calculated values and the data on the accumulation
of the nicked product, the next kinetic constant k3e could be
estimated by fitting these parameters to Scheme 3.

The calculated value for k3e was (0.7–1.4) · 103 s1. Thus,
it is clear that rate constant k2e determined in the cleavage
experiments corresponds to the k4f constant determined in
the fluorescence experiments (their values being 0.08 s1
and 0.06 s1, respectively), and therefore the latter reflects the
first chemical stage of the reaction, release of the damaged
base. Accordingly, k3e constant determined in the cleavage
experiments most likely corresponds to the k5f constant
determined in the fluorescence experiments (0.001 s1 and
0.006 s1, respectively; note that the error in k5f was quite
large due to a large contribution of fluorescence bleaching of
the enzyme at the late stages of the reaction, which may
explain the apparent 6-fold difference in the constants meas-
ured by the two methods), suggesting that k5f is associated with
the second chemical stage, b-elimination of the nascent AP
site. The values of the irreversible rate constants and the
difference between them agree well with the data reported
for Michaelis–Menten approximation of the kinetics of mam-
malian Ogg1 (24,45). The correspondence of k4f and k5f to the
irreversible chemical steps suggests that the preceding equi-
librium stages reflect conformational equilibria during sub-
strate recognition and Michaelis complex formation.
Effect of 8-BrG on the interaction of Ogg1 with
AP:C- and 8-oxoG:C-containing duplexes
As discussed above, the interaction of Ogg1 with substrate
containing an aldehydic AP site was essentially non-catalytic,
with very little b-elimination at the AP site observed for up to
1000 s of the reaction course (Figure 2). Recent structural data
suggested that proton abstraction at C20, a step necessary for
initiating b-elimination, is likely to be catalyzed by the anionic
form of the damaged base immediately after dissociation of
the glycosidic bond (30). Consistent with this, the overall
reaction of AP site cleavage is accelerated by guanine ana-
logues substituted at C8 with an electronegative moiety, such
as 8-BrG (30). To analyze this process in detail, we obtained
fluorescence traces of Ogg1 in the presence of AP:C substrate
and 8-BrG (Figure 4A). Fluorescence titration data indicated
that 8-BrG slightly facilitated non-specific binding of hOgg1
to DNA [KESt
(G:C,BrG) = 0.67 · 105 M; compare KESf(G:C) =
2.9 · 105 M]. The addition of 8-BrG caused a drastic change
in shapes of the fluorescent traces with the AP:C substrate,
which now displayed a behavior characteristic of a regular
reaction time course, with the fluorescence returning back to
the starting values after some time. This change was dependent
on the concentration of 8-BrG (Figure 4B). The reaction pro-
gressed as far as the reaction of Ogg1 with the 8-oxoG:C
substrate being essentially complete after 200 s. Binding
of 8-BrG to Ogg1 in the absence of DNA was not accomp-
anied by a significant fluorescence change even at saturating
concentrations of the base (500 mM) (data not shown). There-
fore, we used Scheme 4 to fit the data and obtain the values of
the kinetic constants (listed in Table 2).
The overall acceleration of the process caused the initial
reaction steps to merge, resulting in only two discernible
stages instead of three stages in Scheme 1. The time course
of accumulation of the eliminated product (Figure 4C) shows
that the characteristic time of strand cleavage correlates well
with that obtained from the fluorescence data.
We also analyzed the effect of 8-BrG on the processing
of the damaged base-containing 8-oxoG:C substrate by Ogg1.
Addition of 8-BrG did not significantly modify fluorescence
traces and the characteristic times of the equilibrium stages.
However, two irreversible steps featured in Scheme 1 merged
in a single fluorescently discernible stage with k4f
(oG:C,BrG) =
0.029 s1, a 5-fold acceleration of the chemistry rate compared
with the calculated overall chemistry rate (0.006 s1) (Table 3).
Experiments with radioactively labeled substrate revealed a
great increase in the rate of accumulation of the product with
the DNA backbone cleaved (Figure 5).

DISCUSSION
Structural basis for Ogg1 fluorescence
The 3D structure of Ogg1 has been determined for the free
enzyme (46), the complex of a catalytically inactive K249Q
Ogg1 with an 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide duplex
(42), the complex of wild-type Ogg1 with an uncleavable
F-containing duplex (43) and the NaBH4-reduced covalent
complex (30). The Ogg1 molecule contains 10 tryptophan
residues, many of which are partially exposed to the surface
and located in those regions of the protein globule that can be
reasonably expected to be rather flexible. Structural features of
the Ogg1 molecule moving along the reaction coordinate can
be revealed by comparing these structures.
To reveal movements of tryptophan residues and changes in
their environment, we analyzed the following Ogg1 structures:
1KO9 [free enzyme (46)], 1EBM [K249Q Ogg1 complexed
with an 8-oxoG-containing duplex (42)], 1HU0 [Ogg1 cross-
linkedtoC10 ofdeoxyribitol,with8-oxoGbasestillpresent inthe
active site (30)], 1LWY [Ogg1 cross-linked to C10 of deoxyrib-
itol, with 8-oxoG base dissociated from the active site (30)]
and 1FN7 [Ogg1 complexed with an tetrahydrofuran
analogue of an abasic site (43)]. Thus, sampling of the series
1KO9! 1EBM!1HU0!1LWY!1FN7!1KO9 provides a
model of five of the stages of the full Ogg1 catalytic cycle
(disregarding the inefficient b-elimination step; Figure 6A),
whereas 1KO9! 1FN7!1KO9 is a model for binding F:C
and AP:C.
We have analyzed the movement of all tryptophan residues
(in terms of r.m.s.d. between two structures adjacent in the
reaction path), as well as the changes in their water-accessible
surfaces. Figure 6B and C shows that Trp224 and Trp272 are
likely to be the most informative Trp residues in fluorescence
kinetic studies, demonstrating the largest amplitude of changes
during the full catalytic cycle. On the other hand, the binding
of Ogg1 to an F:C duplex is expected to be accompanied by a
more pronounced signal from Trp55 and Trp272 and probably
Trp64 and Trp313, but not Trp224. Trp224 and Trp272 occur
in the surface helices of Ogg1 (aJ and aM, respectively)
that can be quite sensitive to DNA binding in general and
to conformational changes in the DNA. In fact, one of these
residues, Trp272, has been proposed to participate in a hinge
movement of a Pro266–Trp272 loop that activates a critical
catalytic residue Asp268 (46). Trp224 participates in the
packing of an extensive helical region encompassing a
helix(aK)–hairpin–helix(aL) motif that harbors the catalytic
Lys249 residue (42,43). Trp55, Trp64 and Trp313 are more
distal to DNA, lying at the opposite surface of the protein
globule, and a change in their fluorescence is likely to reflect
just DNA binding in general. Thus, it is likely that in the
absence of cofactors, such as 8-BrG, we observe only DNA
binding and release in the case of F:C, AP:C, and probably
G:C. More subtle DNA dynamics and catalytically important
rearrangements in the protein molecule, namely in the aJ–aM
helices, are revealed for 8-oxoG:C and AP:C in the presence of
8-BrG, manifesting themselves as individually detectable
fluorescence change steps.
Kinetic model attribution
The general scheme for lesion recognition and excision
by DNA glycosylases (47) includes seven principal
steps: (i) binding to an undamaged DNA stretch; (ii) sliding
along DNA in a search for a lesion; (iii) recognition of a lesion
in double-stranded DNA; (iv) eversion of the damaged
nucleotide into the active site pocket and insertion of specific
enzyme residues in the resulting void in DNA; (v) adjustment
of the enzyme and DNA conformation to that optimal for
catalysis; (vi) one or more catalytic steps leading to base
excision and possibly DNA strand cleavage; and (vii) product
release. Characteristic times of these processes may be vastly
different. For instance, binding of DNA glycosylases to DNA
and sliding along DNA are very rapid (36,37,47–51), whereas
product release in extreme cases may take hours (52).
We have found that the kinetic scheme for Ogg1 acting on
a 8-oxoG:C-containing substrate includes at least three fast
equilibrium steps followed by two slow irreversible steps,
followed in turn by one more equilibrium step. The second
irreversible step was rate-limiting for the complete reaction.
By comparing the data derived from Ogg1 intrinsic fluores-
cence traces and from accumulation of products of different
types, we attributed the irreversible steps to two main chemical
steps of the Ogg1-catalyzed reaction, namely the cleavage
of the N-glycosidic bond of the damaged nucleotide and
b-elimination of its 30-phosphate. Both the absolute values
and the ratio of the respective constants are in good agreement
with the values determined by steady-state kinetics for murine
Ogg1 (24).
The nature of first three equilibria is harder to define
unequivocally, but reasonable suggestions can be made in
this case. First, the lack of discernible fluorescence change
events during Ogg1 binding to non-specific DNA suggests that
recognition steps A and B (see above) are likely not to be
detected in our experiments with cleavable substrates. The
characteristic time of binding to non-specific DNA was
considerably longer than to 8-oxoG-containing DNA. In
fact, non-specific binding and sliding was not detected as
discernible events in pre-steady-state kinetic studies of other
DNA glycosylases, including uracil–DNA glycosylase, Fpg,
and MutY (36,37,47–51), most probably because of very
small size of oligonucleotide targets used in this technique.
The first equilibrium step thus reflects the equilibrium between
free enzyme plus DNA and the complex that is already spe-
cific, with the process of lesion recognition commenced. Base
eversion, void-filling and enzyme conformation adjustment
likely underlie the second and third equilibrium steps.
The last equilibrium step must correspond to product
release, raising an interesting question about the nature of
the released product. In principle, Ogg1 may be in equilibrium
with both the abasic product with the intact backbone and the
product in which the backbone has been nicked. However, we
found that introduction of an equilibrium step for release and
binding of AP-DNA worsened the data fit. In addition, Monte
Carlo simulation of the complete Ogg1 reaction time course
suggests that the rate constant of Ogg1 dissociation from its
abasic product must be extremely low (D. O. Zharkov, manu-
script in preparation). This dramatic difference between dis-
sociation of AP-DNA formed de novo by 8-oxoG excision and
AP-DNA bound from solution may be explained by the per-
sistence of the Schiff base after 8-oxoG excision, efficiently
anchoring Ogg1 to its product, or by conformational differ-
ences in the Ogg1/AP-DNA complex originated by these
different routes. Since we did not observe AP:C cleavage

unassisted by 8-BrG, the KEPf value for the last step of the
reaction with AP:C in the presence of 8-BrG (2.8 · 106 M)
may provide a good estimate for the affinity for the nicked
unsaturated aldehyde product. This value is higher than KEPt
determined by titration with a gapped product (0.88 · 106 M)
and higher than KESf for the AP:C substrate (0.24 · 106 M),
making it likely that the nicked product dissociates faster in
the presence of the excised base.
When AP:C substrate and 8-BrG were used as a model
system, the reaction was most adequately described by two
initial equilibrium steps and one irreversible chemical step
plus the final product release equilibrium step. The nature
of the reversible steps is likely similar to those in the case
of 8-oxoG:C, with the caveat that the structural differences
mentioned in a previous section allow observation of fewer
conformational changes. The irreversible step may correspond
to Schiff base formation or b-elimination; the latter possibil-
ity is more likely since b-elimination is the step accelerated
by 8-BrG.
Stimulation of Ogg1 by 8-BrG
Structural and kinetic evidence (30) point at the just-excised
base in its anionic form as the basic acceptor for a proton at
C20 of the damaged nucleotide to initiate b-elimination fol-
lowing the base excision step. 8-Substituted derivatives of
guanine (8-BrG, 8-aminoguanine) and even guanine itself
have been demonstrated to accelerate nicking at the AP sites
by Ogg1. We have confirmed these observations in stopped-
flow experiments, showing that the rate of b-elimination step
with the AP:C substrate increases at least several orders of
magnitude in the presence of 8-BrG, from virtually undetect-
able to 0.024 s1.
A much less expected finding was that 8-BrG also signific-
antly enhanced the AP lyase activity on the 8-oxoG-containing
substrate. In the case of this substrate, the excised 8-oxoG base
is expected to be retained in the enzyme’s active site pocket
for a considerable time, enough to allow crystallization of
the enzyme with the excised base still associated with it
(30). Given the tightness of the base-accommodating pocket
of Ogg1 (42), it is very unlikely that 8-BrG can be bound in the
pocket first and still retained there after the 8-oxoG moiety is
everted from DNA in the process of catalysis. If anything,
binding of 8-BrG in the pocket before binding the oligonuc-
leotide would show up as competitive inhibition of the overall
reaction. We believe that the observed increase in AP lyase
activity could be explained most reasonably by a rapid equi-
librium step after base excision, allowing for a quick exchange
between the excised 8-oxoG in the active site pocket and
8-BrG outside of the enzyme–DNA complex. The lack of
change in tryptophan fluorescence on 8-BrG binding to the
enzyme globule suggests that this equilibrium could be invis-
ible in our fluorescence traces. Base excision could lead to
a local destabilization of one of the walls of the active site
pocket allowing the excised lesion to diffuse away, as pro-
posed for the bacterial 8-oxoG glycosylase Fpg (20). This
enzyme conformational change may persist after the purine
base exchange, leading to destabilization of the complex and
providing a possible explanation for a lower affinity for the
product formed from the 8-oxoG-containing substrate com-
pared with the product formed from the AP-containing
substrate (compare KEPf values of 2.8 · 106 M for AP:C
in the presence of 8-BrG and 2.1 · 105 M for 8-oxoG:C
in the presence of 8-BrG). When no free base is present in
solution, a very low solubility of 8-oxoG base could still lead
to the equilibrium favoring the presence of 8-oxoG in the
pocket (and thus making it visible in the crystal structure),
whereas simple mass action would shift the balance in favor of
8-BrG in the pocket if 8-BrG is present in saturating concen-
trations in the solution. 8-BrG could also act as an allosteric
activator of the AP lyase activity, but we hold this possibility
less likely, since no structural basis for such interactions is
revealed by the Ogg1 structures (30,42,43,46).
Although our experiments support the mechanism of
product-assisted catalysis of b-elimination, as proposed by
Verdine and co-workers (30), under normal conditions (i.e.
in the absence of externally added guanine derivatives) nick-
ing of DNA by Ogg1 is still very inefficient even when the
substrate contains the damaged base, a precursor of the cata-
lytic moiety (Figure 3B). Therefore, 8-oxoG anion is either
rapidly protonated at N9 or diffuses from the active site
pocket, as discussed above, no longer capable of fulfilling
its proton acceptor role. The activity of Ogg1 was shown to
be stimulated by AP endonucleases (44,53,54); this process
likely involves active displacement of Ogg1 from the complex
with its AP site product and cleavage of the AP site by AP
endonuclease (D. O. Zharkov, manuscript in preparation).
Thus, we argue that the product-assisted catalysis by Ogg1,
despite being interesting mechanistically, is probably irrelev-
ant to the situation in vivo.
Comparison with bacterial 8-oxoG-DNA
glycosylase Fpg
Fpg and Ogg1 are major 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylases in organ-
isms belonging to the kingdoms Bacteria and Eukaryota,
respectively. For both enzymes, 8-oxoG and FapyGua are
the physiological substrates (25,27), although excision of
many other bases from short oligonucleotides have been
reported (20,31). Nevertheless, Fpg and Ogg1 are completely
different in their sequence (15,19), structure (42,55) and do
not fully overlap in their substrate specificity (23–27). Thus,
comparing the kinetic schemes of these two enzymes on the
same set of substrates is of great interest for understanding
the mechanisms of recognition and repair of oxidative purine
lesions. Toward this goal, we have used the same substrate
system as we did previously for E.coli Fpg (36,37).
The most drastic differences between Fpg and Ogg1 were
found, as expected from the earlier steady-state kinetic studies
(23,24), during the chemical steps of the enzymatic reaction.
For Fpg, which proceeds through three concerted chemical
steps (base excision, b-elimination and d-elimination), they
were fast and could not be separated, observed as a single
irreversible reaction in the complete reaction scheme (37).
In contrast, the complete reaction scheme of Ogg1 clearly
included two irreversible reactions, attributed to the base
excision and b-elimination steps and characterized by the
rate constants that differed about an order of magnitude.
The b-elimination step was accelerated in the presence of
8-BrG, whereas this base had no effect on Fpg (37). Struc-
turally this difference between the two enzymes in the effici-
ency of the b-elimination step can be interpreted from the

differences in coordination and neutralization of the leaving
30-phosphate (20).
Recognition of 8-oxoG by Ogg1 and Fpg also proved to be
different. When Fpg was acting on a 8-oxoG:C substrate, at
least five equilibria were observed before chemical steps
ensued, whereas with Ogg1 we found only three reversible
steps. The first of these steps, reflecting binding of the enzyme
to the substrate, was characterized by similar kinetic constants
for both Ogg1 and Fpg, and for both 8-oxoG:C and AP:C
substrates (compare the values for forward rates k1 = 3.2 ·
108 M1 s1 for Fpg/8-oxoG:C, 8.0 · 108 M1 s1 for Fpg/
AP:C, 2.6 · 108 M1 s1 for Ogg1/8-oxoG:C and 5.4 ·
108 M1 s1 for Ogg1/AP:C, and the reverse rates k1 =
890 s1 for Fpg/8-oxoG:C, 250 s1 for Fpg/AP:C, 130 s1
for Ogg1/8-oxoG:C and 960 s1 for Ogg1/AP:C; the values for
Ogg1/AP:C are given for the 8-BrG-containing reaction).
Thus, the primary encounter, translocation to the lesion and
the first stage of lesion recognition are performed by Fpg
and Ogg1 in similar ways, raising the possibility that lesion
recognition is initially governed by the nature of the common
substrate, 8-oxoG. For Fpg, it has recently been suggested
from structural and site-directed mutagenesis data (31) that
the initial stage of lesion recognition involves application of
DNA-distorting force by the enzyme, and that only ‘weak
points’ in DNA are probed further in the enzyme’s active
site; this scheme could probably be applied to Ogg1 as
well. Since the forward rates are approaching the diffusion
limit (109 M1 s1), we suggest that formation of the prim-
ary encounter complex does not involve gross conformational
changes in either Fpg or Ogg1, and that the 1D translocation
is of limited significance with the short substrates used in
this study.
The remaining two equilibria in Ogg1 and four equilibria in
Fpg reflect conformational changes associated with flipping
the target nucleotide out of DNA helix and adjustment of
protein and DNA to the conformation optimal for catalysis.
Obviously, differences in 3D structures of Ogg1 and Fpg
preclude direct comparison of these processes. Nevertheless,
several interesting features are evident from the observed kin-
etics. For example, the equilibrium in the last pre-chemical
step in Ogg1-catalyzed reaction is shifted toward ES2 rather
than ES3 (Scheme 1), making the immediate pre-catalytic
complex a rather minor species in the complete reaction
scheme at all times. In Fpg (37), with its five equilibrium
steps, the third equilibrium is shifted to the left in similar
manner, and the respective complex, ES2, also predominates
for most of the reaction; however, in Fpg the immediate pre-
catalytic complex eventually takes over. Thus, in both Fpg
and Ogg1 the rate-limiting step in lesion recognition (as
opposed to the overall reaction, including catalytic steps)
is the conversion of ES2 to ES3, and ES2 is the complex
contributing most to the process of recognition. There are
reasons to believe that ES1 detected in pre-steady-state kinetic
experiments with DNA glycosylases represents the confor-
mation immediately preceding damaged nucleotide eversion
(49,51); the next step would therefore correspond to the ever-
sion, which could precede insertion of the void-filling residues
stabilizing the everted conformation (51). Thus, we suggest
that the critical conformation in lesion discrimination is the
complex of the enzyme with the everted but not yet fully
stabilized 8-oxoG nucleotide (corresponding to ES2 in the
kinetic scheme), in both Fpg and Ogg1.
After the eversion, several additional equilibrium steps are
observed in Fpg, compared with only one for Ogg1. Although
this may be related to the failure to observe certain conforma-
tional changes not associated with changes in tryptophan fluor-
escence, another possible explanation is more interesting. The
base-binding pocket in Ogg1 is well-formed and tight (42), and
thus little protein movement may be required to accommodate
the everted damaged base. On the other hand, the pocket in
Fpg is flexible and highly dynamic (20,31,56), allowing Fpg to
excise a great repertoire of damaged bases (20), and several
profound movements may be required to accommodate a
given base in a conformation poised for catalysis. Despite
all differences in the number of pre-chemical equilibrium
steps, the characteristic time of accumulation of the final
pre-chemical complex is similar for both Ogg1 and Fpg;
this complex reaches half of its maximum concentration in
5 s after the reaction start.
Similar to other DNA glycosylases and DNA polymerases,
hOgg1 seems to undergo a multistep open-to-closed con-
formational transition during substrate binding and further
conformational changes during catalysis. Such behavior illus-
trates the concept of the dynamic model of enzyme catalysis
(57), in which conformational changes in the enzyme molecule
drive the substrate-to-product conversion. Ongoing experi-
ments addressing hOgg1 reaction dynamics with substrates
containing other modified purines and complementary bases
should improve our understanding of the mechanism of lesion
recognition by this repair enzyme.
