ABSTRACT
Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid
production of large sequence data sets. These tech-
nologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and bio-
medical research, but a thorough characterization
of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We gen-
erated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read
data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta
vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from
the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found
that error rates range from 0.3% at the beginning
of reads to 3.8% at the end of reads. Wrong base
calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base sub-
stitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold,
with A>C transversion being among the most fre-
quent and C>G transversions among the least fre-
quent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions
of single bases occur at very low rates. When simu-
lating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing
coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by
correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced
regions is biased; the highest read density was
found in intervals with elevated GC content. High
Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low
scores underestimate the data quality. Our results
show different types of biases and ways to
detect them. Such biases have implications on
the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de
novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification
of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA
methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome
analysis.
INTRODUCTION
The DNA sequencing ﬁeld has experienced a major boost
with the emergence of novel sequencing technologies.
Several systems are currently on the market, including
Illumina’s Solexa instrument, the Applied Biosystems’
Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection
(SOLiD) technology, and the GS FLX instruments from
Roche/454 Life Sciences. The Polony cyclic sequencing by
synthesis technology is to be launched (1).
These technologies allow sequence determination much
quicker and cheaper than the dideoxy chain terminator
method presented by Sanger in 1977 (2). The main diﬀer-
ence between Sanger sequencing output and the output of
the new technologies is an increased read number, asso-
ciated with a decrease in the length of individual reads.
To achieve high throughput, the new approaches apply
diﬀerent strategies. 454 Life Sciences has adapted pyrose-
quencing to a microbead format to sequence 400 000
DNA fragments simultaneously, resulting in a per-run
dataset of 100Mbp with reads averaging 250 bp. SOLiD
sequencing also uses templates immobilized onto microbe-
ads. Here, the sequence of the template DNA is decoded
by ligation assays involving oligonucleotides labeled
with diﬀerent ﬂuorophores. The SOLiD read length is
currently 25–35 bases, and 2–3Gbp of data can be col-
lected during an 8-day run. Solexa sequencing is based on
amplifying single molecules attached to the surface of
a ﬂow cell to generate clusters of identical molecules, fol-
lowed by sequencing using ﬂuorophore-labeled reversible
chain terminators. Solexa sequencing proceeds a base at a
time and read length depends on the number of sequenc-
ing cycles. Current Illumina sequencing instrumentation
achieves read lengths of 36 bases. The Solexa ﬂow cell
is composed of eight separately loadable lanes. Since
each lane has a capacity of about 5 million reads, > 40
million reads can be generated in a run of 3 days, equiva-
lent to > 1.3Gbp.
The adoption of high-throughput sequencing will revo-
lutionize molecular biology research, similar to the inven-
tion of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) twenty years
ago (3). 454 pyrosequencing short (100 bp) reads gen-
erated on Roche GS20 instruments (now replaced by
GS FLX) were successfully used for the de novo sequenc-
ing of small genomes and BACs as well as for transcript
discovery and characterization (4–9). De novo genomic
sequencing succeeded even when ultra-short (27–36 bp)
reads generated by Solexa sequencing were employed for

a small genome (10). For the human genome, ultra-short
reads were applied in studies on chromatin analysis
(11,12).
However, working with large data sets of short reads
involves diﬃculties, especially due to wrong base calls. To
exploit the full prospects of the novel technologies there is
the need to know as much as possible about biases in the
output data sets, especially with respect to errors. Previous
studies focused on the 454 technology (13) or dealt with
the prospects of short read sequencing as such (14). Here,
we characterize two Solexa read data sets: 12.3 million
36mer reads (trimmed to 32 bases) from the Helicobacter
acinonychis genome and 2.8 million 27mer reads from
a Beta vulgaris bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC)
clone. We analyze these reads and detect biases with
respect to error positions, error rates, erroneous base
calls and their neighboring bases and single base insertions
or deletions. We determine the compensation of erroneous
base calls by correct base calls depending on the sequenc-
ing coverage. We analyze read start positions, the read
coverage along the target sequence, and dependencies of
read coverage and local sequence characteristics. Finally,
we assess the reliability of quality values for wrong and
correct base calls.
METHODS
Solexa sequencing
Helicobacter acinonychis. DNA was fragmented by nebu-
lization as described in the Solexa protocol (www.illumi
na.com). Beta vulgaris DNA was sheared for 1 h with a
UTR200 sonication device (Hielscher Ultrasonics GmbH)
at 100% amplitude and 0.5 cycle mode. Fragmented DNA
was further processed as described previously (10).
Sequencing was carried out by running 27 or 36 cycles,
respectively, on the Illumina 1G sequencing instrument.
The Goat module (Firecrest v.1.8.28 and Bustard
v.1.8.28 programs) of the Solexa pipeline v.0.2.2.3 (for
Helicobacter data set) and v.0.2.2.5 (for Beta data set)
were used for image deconvolution and quality value cal-
culation. Parameterization was auto-generated by the
pipeline (see Supplementary Data for intensity plots and
run parameters, i.e. frequency cross-talk matrix, oﬀsets,
phasing). Set up conﬁguration was used as installed by
Illumina’s technical staﬀ. The Helicobacter data set was
collected from three lanes of two ﬂow cells. The Beta
data set was generated in a single lane from a further
ﬂow cell.
Data analysis
We developed various Perl scripts to extract and process
information from ELAND output ﬁles (Gerald module
v.1.27 of the Solexa pipeline) and to ﬁnd positions of
reads that can be aligned more than once to the reference
sequence without mismatches (the positions of those reads
are not reported by ELAND). We wrote Perl scripts for
the detection of deletions and insertions of single nucleo-
tides in otherwise error-free reads and for the analysis of
quality values per base call. Plots were generated with the
statistical computing environment R (www.R-project.org)
or OpenOﬃce Calc (www.openoﬃce.org). R: A language
and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation

Data availability
Solexa read data are available from the SHARCGS
project website at http://sharcgs.molgen.mpg.de.
RESULTS
We previously generated 12 288 791 36mer reads from
Helicobacter acinonychis on an Illumina 1G sequencing
device (10). The Helicobacter genome is 1.55Mbp in size
and has a GC content of 38%. A high-quality reference
sequence for Helicobacter is available (GenBank
NC_008229) (15). We ran the ELAND software on the
read data set (trimmed by the last four bases, because
ELAND processes the ﬁrst 32 bases only) and selected
the 8 389 548 32mer reads that ELAND reported to be
uniquely matched against the Helicobacter reference
sequence with zero, one or two mismatches (labeled U0,
U1 or U2, respectively, see Figure 1b). Additionally, we
generated a 27mer read data set for the sugar beet (Beta
vulgaris) bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC) clone ZR-
47B15. The data set consists of 2 788 286 reads, 2 156 266
of which were labeled U0, U1 or U2 in the ELAND
output (Figure 1a). The Sanger reference sequence in ﬁn-
ished quality of this BAC insert consists of 10 9563 bases
with 34.85% GC (Dohm et al., manuscript submitted for
publication). For all uniquely matched reads, ELAND
reports the match position in the reference sequence as
well as the error position(s) in the read.
Start positions of reads and read distribution on
the target sequence
The preparation of Solexa sequencing libraries involves
the fragmentation of the DNA, followed by the adaptor
ligation, pre-ampliﬁcation for material enrichment and
ampliﬁcation within the ﬂow cell prior to sequencing. In
order to detect whether the steps preceding sequencing
show biases, we analyzed the ﬁrst bases of a read and
the bases that ﬂank the read start position on either
side. Of all possible 27mer tuples (Beta) and 32mer
tuples (Helicobacter), 99.8 and 98.8% are unique, respec-
tively. We therefore assume that potential biases are repre-
sentative for the data set.
We calculated the frequency of 2- to 10-base tuples
enclosing the starting point for 8 389 548 uniquely
matched Helicobacter reads and for 2 156 266 uniquely
matched Beta reads relative to the frequency of these
tuples in the reference sequences. Since the bases in the
reads are subject to errors, we used for both sides the bases
of the corresponding region in the reference sequence.
A general sequence bias for the immediate vicinity of
the read start position could not be deduced from the two
data sets. The results for the Beta data set did not suggest
any tendencies (Supplementary Figure 1a). The results
for the reads from Helicobacter showed a weak tendency
towards T being the most frequent base call to the left and

to the right of the read start position (Supplementary
Figure 1b). Since two diﬀerent fragmentation methods
were used, sonication for Beta and nebulization for
Helicobacter, the results may indicate method-inherent
properties.
However, by analysing sequence characteristics and
number of reads starting in a sliding window of 1 kbp in
width, we found a correlation of read coverage and GC
content in both data sets (Figure 2). In regions of elevated
GC content the number of reads was increased. For
instance, windows with a GC content of 40% contain
almost twice as many reads as windows with 30% GC in
the Beta data set. Thus, while the vicinity of 10 bp was not
suﬃcient to detect a conclusive bias for read starting
points, there is a strong preference towards GC-rich
regions in 1 kbp sliding windows. Since both templates
show the correlation of read coverage and GC content,
the shift to GC rich regions seems to be a general feature
of the current pre-sequencing procedure. A similar ﬁnding
was reported by Hillier et al. (16).
The overall coverage considering matching reads only is
165-fold in the Helicobacter data set (185-fold for 36mer
reads) and 465-fold in the Beta data set. The distribution
of matching reads along the reference sequences is shown
in Figure 3. We calculated the read depth in windows of

size 7.77 kbp for Helicobacter (Figure 3a) and of size
0.58 kbp for Beta (Figure 3b). The coverage varied by
a factor of 13 and 3.8, respectively, ranging from 49- to
652-fold for Helicobacter and from 238- to 897-fold for
Beta (Table 1). We tested whether the distributions shown
in Figure 3 are compatible with a uniform distribution
of reads across the target sequences. We have applied a
2-test (goodness of ﬁt) to reject the hypothesis that reads
have the same probability to fall into equally sized regions
of the target sequence (P< 1e10 even when dividing
target sequences in only ﬁve regions).
There is a number of ‘gap’ positions in the target
sequences where no read starts from. However, since
there are no gaps larger than read length all positions of
the target sequence are covered (Supplementary Table 1).
Distribution of error positions along reads
We selected all ELAND U1 and U2 reads, i.e. 28 0173
Beta reads and 2 046 923 Helicobacter reads (cf.
Figure 1), to analyze the occurrence of errors per position.
We performed two types of calculations. Firstly, we calcu-
lated the fraction of wrong base calls at each read position
considering wrong base calls only. Secondly, we calculated
per-base error rates, i.e. the fraction of wrong base calls
per position considering all base calls. The result is shown
in Figure 4. The number of occurrences of wrong bases is
increased at the ﬁrst position. Rising from the lowest error
rate at the second position, the highest error rate is
observed at the last positions of the read [similar observa-
tion reported in (16)]: 2.5 and 2.9% of the errors in the
data sets of Beta and Helicobacter, respectively, were
found at read position 1, and 11.8% of errors were
recorded at the last read position (position 27 in the
Beta data set and position 32 in the Helicobacter data
set, Figure 4a). The per-base error rates range from
0.3% to 3.8% (Figure 4b) resulting in an average error
rate of 0.6% for the Beta data set and 1.0% for
the Helicobacter data set. Note that only uniquely
matched reads with less than three substitution errors
are considered.
In re-sequencing projects, sequencing errors can be
compensated by high-coverage sequencing. In a re-sequen-
cing project, the reads are aligned against a reference
sequence. Wherever a mismatch between sequencing
data and the reference is observed, a polymorphism is
postulated. In order to avoid spurious detection of poly-
morphisms due to sequencing errors, a consensus between
several reads at each position of the reference is common
practice. Here, we simulate re-sequencing at diﬀerent
depth by randomly choosing the appropriate number of
reads from our two data sets and counting wrong and
correct base calls [ﬁve (Helicobacter) or ten (Beta) simula-
tions per data point]. An error was considered as compen-
sated when at least one correct base call for the same
position existed. A correct base call and the reference
sequence hold the majority over one wrong base call, i.e.
x wrong base calls at the same position can be compen-
sated by x correct base calls (plus reference sequence).

We plotted the dependency of sequencing coverage and
error compensation in Figure 5 (range of simulation
results: see Supplementary Figure 2). Increasing the
sequencing coverage results in a rapid decrease of uncom-
pensated errors. At a coverage of 20-fold the average
number of errors per kilo base pair is close to zero and
does not decrease any further. However, such estimates
are likely to change with improvements of the sequencing
technology, as less coverage will be suﬃcient for reduced
error rates.
Analysis of reads containing two errors
ELAND reported 88 753 reads containing two errors
in the Beta data set, corresponding to 4.1% of all uniquely
matched reads. In Helicobacter, 647 151 reads contained
two errors (7.7% of all uniquely matched reads).
We analyzed the distance between erroneous bases and
found a preference for small distances between errors
(Figure 6). In 25% of reads that contained two errors
the erroneous bases were either at adjacent positions or
separated by one base. This observation does not contra-
dict the assumption that errors occur independently
according to their position-speciﬁc probability. The heat-
map in Supplementary Figure 3 illustrates the occurrence
of two errors relative to the positions in the read. As
expected from the per-base error rates, two-error occur-
rences are concentrated at the 30 end of reads and are
therefore close together. In addition, error pairs also
occur with increased frequency at read positions 1 and
2. We provide even stronger evidence for the independence
of error positions in two-error reads in Supplementary
Figure 4.
Although error positions seem to be independent in
reads with two errors, there is evidence that errors accu-
mulate in reads more easily than expected. We deduce this
from the ratios of the observed and expected number of
reads containing one and two errors respectively:
Given the determined error rates per position (for the
Helicobacter data set) we expect 3.5 times more correct
reads (U0) than reads with one error (U1), but we observe
4.5 times more U0 than U1; we expect 19.8 times more
correct reads than reads with two errors (U2), but we
observe 9.8 times more U0 than U2. Thus, there are

For coverages above 3-fold the number of uncompensated errors drops
rapidly with the increase of coverage.

fewer U1 reads than expected and more U2 reads than
expected compared to the U0 reads. This tendency is con-
ﬁrmed in the Beta data set (data not shown) and suggests
dependencies in the occurrence of errors.
Analysis of error base sequence context
In order to ﬁnd sequence composition preferences close to
wrong base calls, we analyzed the sequence tuples ﬂanking
error positions. Since errors at position 1 do not have
preceding bases and errors at the last position do not
have subsequent bases in the read, we used the corre-
sponding segment of the reference sequence for the analy-
sis. This also avoids analysing wrong base calls in the
error-prone read sequences close to the error position
under consideration. The sequence composition before
the read start is not considered to be responsible for
an error at position 1 because this part of the source
sequence is not part of the sequenced fragment.
However, the bases following the end of the read could
have an inﬂuence on the base calling. We decided to treat
all error positions in the same manner by looking up the
ﬂanking bases in the reference sequence. As reference
tuples we did not consider all tuples in the reference
sequence but all tuples in all uniquely matched reads
(taken from the reference sequence and adding 5 bases
before and after the corresponding read segment). This
is to keep the analysis clean from the read coverage bias
towards GC-rich regions of the reference sequence. We
calculated the relative frequencies for 3- to 11-base
tuples enclosing the error at the middle position and gen-
erated sequence logos for Beta and Helicobacter sepa-
rately. To visualize the general trend we show the 3- and
5-base tuple results in scatterplots with the tuple frequen-
cies for both data sets (Figure 7 and Supplementary
Figure 5). All 3-base tuples starting with a G are clearly
dominant in both data sets with G-error-G and G-error-A
being the top candidates (Figure 7). Error enclosing tuples
starting with A or T are underrepresented, and error
enclosing tuples starting with C are as frequent as in the
reference tuples. The least frequent base after an error is
T, being the third base in the three least frequent tuples
A-error-T, T-error-T and C-error-T. The trend of G being
the most frequent base before an error is preserved
and even more emphasized in the scatterplot with 5-base
tuples (Supplementary Figure 5). Here, Gs are still the
preferred bases before an error, and least frequently we
see errors enclosed by Ts. In 35 and 32% of cases (Beta
and Helicobacter, respectively), the error position was
preceded by G.
Analysis of base substitution errors in Solexa reads
Twelve substitution errors (eight transversions and four
transitions) are possible during a base call. We compared
the wrong base calls in the reads to the base in the refer-
ence sequence and found that base substitution errors in
Solexa reads are not equally frequent. Generally, the two
data sets show similar tendencies (Figure 8, Table 2). The
most frequent base to be changed into is a C, preferen-
tially substituting T or A in the Beta data set and A in the
Helicobacter data set (T in Helicobacter as well but at a
lower frequency). Consistently for both data sets, C>G
transversions are the least frequent substitution errors.
The top three types of substitution errors account for
>53% of all substitution errors found in the
Helicobacter read data set (the transversions A>C,
G>T and A>T) and for >42% of all substitution
errors found in the Beta data set (the transition T>C
and the transversions A>C and C>A).

Helicobacter acinonychis and Beta vulgaris, considering one base

the substituted base. The scatterplot shows the correlation of the rela-
tive frequencies (relating the frequency of 3-tuples at error positions to
the frequency of all 3-tuples in the reads) for the two data sets.

Insertions and deletions in the Solexa read data sets
The ELAND algorithm is limited to the alignment of reads
containing up to two substitution errors. In addition to the
reads matched by ELAND to the reference sequence there
is a substantial amount of unmatched reads (Figure 1).
Some of the unmatched reads contain more than two
sequencing errors, but another reason for unmatched
reads may be the occurrence of insertions and deletions
(indels). We implemented a Perl script to ﬁnd single nucleo-
tide indels within reads without considering additional sub-
stitution errors. We observed a very low rate (<0.01%) of
indel errors: 323 of 2.8 million Beta reads contain a single
nucleotide insertion and 1258 Beta reads contain a single
nucleotide deletion; 1215 and 2284 insertion and deletion
errors, respectively, were found in theHelicobacter data set.
Further inspection of the data revealed that >25% of
base insertions occurred in homopolymer tracts of four
or more nucleotides. However, no clear trend could be
detected for deletions. With respect to the positions
within reads where indels occur there is a slight accumula-
tion of such events at internal positions of the reads. No
bias for inserted or deleted bases could be detected (data
not shown). The reason for detecting this type of error
might be sequencing errors in the reference sequences.
For Helicobacter, two erroneous insertions in the Sanger
sequence were reported (10). Approximately 10% of
Illumina reads with one deletion match to these two
positions.
Assessment of quality values
The Solexa base caller Bustard reports the quality of each
base call by estimating a quality score similar to the phred
score based on the image output without considering the
reference sequence. More precisely, Bustard estimates the
probability P of a base call to be wrong and reports
the corresponding quality score Q=10 log10 (P/(1P).
Thus, a quality score Q=40 roughly corresponds to an
expected error probability of P=0.01%, and Q=0 cor-
responds to an expected error probability of P=50%.
Based on uniquely matched reads reported by ELAND,
we have determined 7 201 633 correct and 36 9113 wrong
base calls in the Beta data set as well as 70 995 154 correct
and 2 694 074 wrong base calls in theHelicobacter data set.
We have extracted the corresponding quality scores from
Bustard output ﬁles and computed observed error rates
per quality score. Table 3 shows a comparison of the
expected and observed error rates for the base call score
quality in our two data sets: Theoretical values under-
estimate the error probability for high quality values
and overestimate the error probability for low quality
values.
We also collected the quality values for bases reported
by ELAND as correct separately from quality values for
bases reported as wrong (matching reads only). Figure 9
shows the results in separate histograms. The fraction
of the best quality value is increased for correct base
calls and low quality values show low fractions as
expected. However, there is a substantial amount of
high quality values for wrong base calls. Six percent
of all wrong base calls in Helicobacter and 19% of all
wrong base calls in Beta have Solexa quality scores
Q=40.

DISCUSSION
We have characterized two Solexa read data sets derived
from a bacterial genome (Helicobacter acinonychis) and
from a Beta vulgaris BAC clone. We looked for systematic
biases of read start positions, recorded the error positions
and the error frequency along the read length, examined
the distribution of reads along the reference sequences,
investigated substitution preferences, and assessed the
reliability of quality scores. The generalization of our
observations may be limited by the fact that the presented
data relates to a single Illumina 1G Analyzer. However,
since three diﬀerent ﬂow cells, four diﬀerent lanes and two
diﬀerent library preparations for two diﬀerent target
sequences are involved we assume that our consistent
observations reﬂect relevant aspects of the current state
of Solexa technology.
To explain the observed biases, a comprehensive knowl-
edge of the Solexa technology is necessary. The source
DNA is fragmented randomly, and adapter molecules
are ligated at both ends of each fragment followed by
pre-ampliﬁcation for enrichment of the material. The
DNA fragments are melted, and the single strands are
trapped inside the ﬂow cell which is covered by a dense
lawn of primers. Subsequent local ampliﬁcation leads to
the formation of clusters of approximately 1000 identical
molecules per square micrometer. The base incorporation
is started by adding primers, polymerase and the four
ﬂourophore-labeled deoxynucleotidetriphosphates. The
dNTPs act as reversible terminators, i.e. only a single
base is added per molecule in each cycle. The cluster ﬂuor-
escence is measured to identify which base has been incor-
porated. A green laser identiﬁes the incorporation of the
bases G and T, and a red laser identiﬁes the bases A and C.
Two diﬀerent ﬁlters are used to distinguish between
G/T and A/C, respectively. After signal detection, the
ﬂuorophore and the terminating modiﬁcation of the
nucleotide are removed.
In the context of this work we could not detect a general
sequence bias for the immediate vicinity of read start posi-
tions, indicating that the fragmentation step is essentially
random. Two diﬀerent methods of fragmentation were
used but potential trends for each method were rather
weak. However, we did observe a strong correlation
between GC richness and read coverage, with the read den-
sity being increased in regions of elevated GC content.
Uneven coverage of the target genome is well known
from Sanger sequencing, but this eﬀect has been attributed
to a cloning bias in the underlying plasmid shotgun
libraries. Since the propagation of Solexa templates in
E. coli is avoided, the cloning procedure cannot be a
reason for the read distribution bias. Another reason for
biases towards GC-rich sequences could be the diﬀerent
melting behaviour of double-stranded DNA. AT-rich
DNA segments denature at lower temperatures than GC-
rich DNA. In Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE)
and Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data
sets, the even more dissimilar melting behaviour due to the
shortness of the templates (14–21 bases) is supposed to be
the reason for the observed bias towards GC-rich
sequences (17,18). Since the fragment libraries for Solexa
sequencing are larger having sizes of 120–170 bp, denatura-
tion of the DNA is less likely to occur. However, potential
denaturation eﬀects are most likely to occur at the adapter-
free state of the DNA molecules. Once adapters have been
ligated to the fragments, the DNA is no longer sensitive to
denaturation. According to the protocol for library genera-
tion, we performed a PCR enrichment step. This step might
introduce bias as well. However, described PCR-intro-
duced biases have opposite eﬀects, i.e. sub-optimal ampli-
ﬁcation of GC-rich templates (19).
Solexa sequencing base call errors occur preferentially
at the 30 end of reads. For the accumulation of errors
towards the end of the read, we consider the following
scenario. All immobilized DNA molecules in a cluster
are supposed to give the same signal at a time because
each cycle usually adds exactly one base to the growing
double strand along the template in a cluster. Whenever
single DNA molecules in the cluster are not elongated
properly, the overall cluster signal suﬀers from interfer-
ence by molecules which are out of phase. Failures in
the deprotection (i.e. removal of the terminator group)
of incorporated bases can lead to this type of interference.
Without deprotection, the next base cannot be added and
all bases of following cycles are shifted by one position
in this DNA molecule. Thus, with increasing cycle num-
bers shifts accumulate leading to an increased error rate in
later cycles. Additionally, incomplete removal of the ﬂuo-
rophore results in more than one ﬂuorescing base in
the following cycle and interferes with signal interpreta-
tion as well.
Sequence tuples before an error position are preferen-
tially G-rich. This result suggests that G might be prefer-
entially subject to an incomplete step of deprotection and
ﬂuorophore removal.
The way signals are detected oﬀers an explanation for
the observed preferences of base substitution errors.
The green laser is used to detect G and T at the same
time. The brightness of G is enhanced by the use of a
ﬁlter to distinguish G versus T incorporation. Similarly,
A and C are detected by the red laser and distinguished by
using diﬀerent ﬁlters. The transversions G>T and A>C
are among the most frequent base substitutions in both of
our data sets, suggesting that these base call errors arise
because of insuﬃcient discrimination of the respective
base emission spectra.
The quality of Sanger sequences is aﬀected by the pre-
sence of GC-rich sequences as well, but also by polyA or
polyT homopolymer runs and by repeats causing second-
ary structure (20). In a recent survey on the accuracy of
454 pyrosequencing, Huse et al. (13) estimated that
39% of all errors that had passed GS20 quality ﬁltering
occur in homopolymer length detection. This is certainly
linked to the fact that 454 technology sequences homo-
polymer tracts in single cycles. In contrast, Solexa
sequencing proceeds in a sequential manner, one base
at a time. As expected, we have not noted an increased
error rate in homopolymer runs of Solexa reads. The
Solexa one-by-one sequencing procedure is probably
also ensuring that base insertions and deletions in general
occur at very low rates.

Each sequencing technology provides base quality
values. Sanger sequencing phred scores are
calculated from log-transformed probabilities that a base
call is incorrect. For example, a phred score of 30
indicates a probability of 0.1% of a wrong base call.
In 454 sequencing, quality scores do not provide
a measure that a base at a given position is correct, but
merely indicate that homopolymer length has been called
correctly. It has been found that GS20 reads with average
quality scores above 25 had very few errors (13). Solexa
scores and phred scores are calculated diﬀerently, but
scores above 15 have approximately the same meaning.
Our observations, however, suggest that the scores deter-
mined by the Solexa software underestimate the true error
rate by up to 100 times for high quality values and over-
estimate the true error rate for low quality values.
Our results lead to several implications for analyses with
Solexa reads. Even if an excellent Q-value is determined
there is a chance for a wrong base call at this position.
Thus, during re-sequencing for SNP discovery, variable
positions need conﬁrmation, preferably from the opposite
strand. Some types of substitution errors occur more
frequently than others. Such SNP candidates should
be treated with caution, even in case of conﬁrmation.
Especially if one or more Gs precede the putative SNP
a wrong base call should be considered. However, in
re-sequencing projects most sequencing errors can be dis-
cerned from bona ﬁde SNPs by applying high coverages
(for our data sets: 20-fold and above). In the context
of DNA methylation site detection by shotgun bisulﬁte
sequencing (21), the frequency of erroneous detection of
C instead of T and vice versa is of particular interest.
T>C transitions could be a source for false positives,
while C>T substitutions could cause false negative
results. For de novo sequencing, systematic substitution
errors may confound the ability of ﬁltering correct reads
and increase the chance for misassemblies. The read pre-
valence in GC-rich regions aﬀects all assumptions inferred
from the overall read coverage (e.g. the expected maxi-
mum number of missing reads in a row). The identiﬁcation
of conﬁrmed SNPs in AT-rich regions may be hampered
by poor sequence coverage. Thus, Solexa-based de novo
sequencing as well as re-sequencing activities need to cali-
brate their sequencing output for achieving accordingly
high read coverage of AT-rich regions. The bias in read
coverage might also impact the estimation of expression
levels of transcripts by ultra-short read sequencing. If no
compensation is applied the expression levels of GC-rich
transcripts may be overestimated.
