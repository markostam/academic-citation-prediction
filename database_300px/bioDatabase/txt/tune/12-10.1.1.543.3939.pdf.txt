ABSTRACT
Sequence-specific interference with the nuclear
pre-mRNA splicing machinery has received
increased attention as an analytical tool and for
development of therapeutics. It requires sequence-
specific and high affinity binding of RNaseH-
incompetent DNA mimics to pre-mRNA. Peptide
nucleic acids (PNA) or phosphoramidate morpholino
oligonucleotides (PMO) are particularly suited as
steric block oligonucleotides in this respect.
However, splicing correction by PNA or PMO con-
jugated to cell penetrating peptides (CPP), such as
Tat or Penetratin, has required high concentrations
(5–10 kM) of such conjugates, unless an endosomo-
lytic agent was added to increase escape from
endocytic vesicles. We have focused on the mod-
ification of existing CPPs to search for peptides able
to deliver more efficiently splice correcting PNA or
PMO to the nucleus in the absence of endosomolytic
agents. We describe here R6-Penetratin (in which
arginine-residues were added to the N-terminus of
Penetratin) as the most active of all CPPs tested so
far in a splicing correction assay in which masking of
a cryptic splice site allows expression of a luciferase
reporter gene. Efficient and sequence-specific cor-
rection occurs at 1kM concentration of the R6Pen–
PNA705 conjugate as monitored by luciferase lumi-
nescence and by RT-PCR. Some aspects of the
R6Pen–PNA705 structure–function relationship have
also been evaluated.
INTRODUCTION
A serious limitation of the use of many types of synthetic
oligonucleotides (ON) and their analogues as therapeutic
antisense agents has been their poor cellular delivery (1,2).
Many types of vector have been designed to aid ON
delivery both for cell culture and in vivo. Amongst such
strategies, conjugation to cell penetrating peptides (CPP)
has received much recent attention (3–6).
In the case of negatively charged antisense ON, the
potential of conjugated CPPs for delivery has not been
realized, since there are very few publications that have
shown signiﬁcant biological activity (7,8). Indeed, a recent
study with a well-controlled assay dealing with inhibition
of trans-activation of the HIV-1 LTR showed some
signiﬁcant cell internalization of a number of CPP-ONs,
but a complete lack of biological activity (9). In addition,
only very modest biological activity was found for similar
CPPs conjugated to synthetic short interference RNA
(siRNA) targeted to a P38 MAP kinase mRNA (10).
A particularly useful HeLa cell assay for assessing the
activity of CPP-ONs conjugates in a comparative manner
is that established by Kole and colleagues (11) involving
splice correction of an aberrant -globin intron by 16-mer
synthetic oligonucleotides (705 site) and subsequent
up-regulation of ﬁreﬂy luciferase. This assay is straight-
forward to carry out and has a very high dynamic range,
such that even very low activity levels can be seen as a
positive luminescence read-out. CPPs conjugated to ONs
that are not negatively charged, such as peptide nucleic
acids (PNA) or phosphoramidate morpholino oligonu-
cleotides (PMO) have shown signiﬁcant promise in
splicing correction assays and other steric block applica-
tions, for which PNA is particularly suited. For many
PNA conjugates, biological activity in this and other splice
alteration assays has been observed when the PNA is
attached to cationic, amphipathic or other CPP peptides,
but concentrations of conjugates in the 5–10 mM range
almost invariably have been needed for incubation with
cultured cells to see signiﬁcant splice alteration activity
(12–19).
Recent studies by our laboratories (19–23) and by other
groups (24,25) have demonstrated that a major barrier for
nuclear delivery, required for splicing correction, is the
release from endocytic vesicular compartments. This was
not surprising since, for polycationic CPPs such as Tat,

Penetratin, R9 or K8, the vast majority of the material is
internalized by an active mechanism of endocytosis, which
involves electrostatic interactions with cellular heparan
sulphates, and has little access to the nuclear compartment
(20). Endosomolytic agents, such as chloroquine, calcium
ions or high sucrose concentration (21,26), are necessary
to obtain a signiﬁcant splice correction activity (17–19,23),
but the use of such agents in vivo is diﬃcult to envisage.
One possible solution is to complement the CPP with a
membrane-destabilizing agent (e.g. viral fusogenic peptide
or membrane-destabilizing peptide), such as has been
proposed by Dowdy to improve CPP-mediated protein
transfection (27), or to screen for a new peptide additive
that might improve the biological activity of the CPP
conjugate. In addition to the increased complexity of such
a delivery system and to its cost, we have not been able to
ﬁnd to date a peptide or lipopeptide that showed
substantially enhanced steric-block biological activity for
a PNA ON conjugated to the Tat peptide (19). Likewise
the co-incubation of 5 mM HA2–Penetratin fusion peptide
with various CPP–PNA constructions had only a moder-
ate eﬀect on splice correction (18).
We, therefore, concluded that a better approach is to
modify existing CPPs in order to search for peptides that
may have enhanced intrinsic endosomolytic activity. Two
vector strategies have been adopted, both taking into
account the key roles played by Arg side chains in CPP
uptake. We recently showed that (R-Ahx-R)4–PMO705
conjugate had signiﬁcant splicing correction activity in the
luciferase up-regulation model at 1 mM concentration in
the absence of an endosomolytic agent (28). Similarly we
showed that a (R-Ahx-R)4–PNA705 conjugate also had
signiﬁcant splice correction activity at 1 mM concentration
(19). In parallel studies, we found substantial activity in an
HIV-1 trans-activation inhibition assay (also requiring
nuclear delivery) when a derivative of the known CPP
Penetratin, in which six Arg residues were added to the
N-terminus of the CPP, R6-Penetratin (R6Pen), was
disulﬁde-conjugated to a PNA complementary to the
trans-activation responsive element RNA (21). We show
now that this Arg-modiﬁed CPP when conjugated to a
PNA targeted to the luciferase splice correction site shows
by far the highest up-regulation of luciferase at both
protein and RNA levels at 1 mM concentration compared
to all previous CPPs studied. We also begin to characterize
some aspects of the structure–function relationship and
show that, for example, a W!L mutant that was reported
to substantially reduce the cell penetration of Penetratin
peptide (29) does not reduce the splice correction activity
of the R6Pen–PNA conjugate. These results show that
R6Pen might be a very good lead CPP towards further
development of a suitable PNA–peptide conjugate candi-
date for in vivo studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of peptide–PNA conjugates
Synthesis of PNA. N-terminal nitropyridyl (Npys)
cysteine-containing PNA oligonucleotides with additional
lysine residues were synthesized on an Apex 396
Synthesizer by the Fmoc/Bhoc method as previously
described (21,30) to give the general structure NH2-
Cys(NPys)-Lys-PNA-(Lys)3-amide. PNA705 antisense is
CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACA and PNA705 scrambled
sequence is CCTGTTATACCACTTACA. Note that we
have found recently that higher overall synthesis yields are
obtained when the ﬁnal deprotections are carried out in the
absence of phenol scavenger. In some cases, N-terminal
Cys-containing PNA was obtained from Panagene
(www.panagen.com) and activated with dipyridyldisulﬁde
(Pys2) as follows. To the PNA (500 nmol) was added 150 ml
Pys2 (6.75 mmol, 13.5 eq.) in DMF (10mgml1), 15 ml 2M
triethylammonium acetate solution (pH 7) and 135 ml
water. After standing for 1 h the solution was loaded on to
a Sephadex NAP-10 column and eluted with 0.1% TFA
solution, collecting the excluded volume. This solution
was used directly in conjugation after quantiﬁcation by
measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm. Npys and
Pys activated PNA could be used interchangeably in the
conjugation reactions to form disulﬁde linkages.
Stably Linked K8-PNA705 [NH2-(Lys)8-CCTCTT
ACCTCAGTTACA-Lys-amide] and Tat-PNA705
[NH2-Gly-Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-Arg-Pro-
(O-linker)-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACA-amide] peptide–
PNA conjugates were synthesized by continuous
PNA/peptide synthesis as previously described (21,30).
An O-linker was added with an Fmoc-AEEA spacer
(Applied Biosystems). The a-N-bromoacetyl-Lys-PNA-
(Lys)3-amide (both 705 and scrambled 705) were obtained
from Panagene (Korea).
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out on a
Voyager DE Pro BioSpectrometry workstation with a
matrix of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 10mgml1 in
acetonitrile/3% aqueous triﬂuoroacetic acid (1:1, v/v). The
accuracy of the mass measurement in linear mode is
regarded by the manufacturer as  0.05%, but since
internal calibration was not used, the determined values
varied in a few cases from the calculated by  0.1%.
Synthesis of peptides. All peptides were prepared with free
N-terminus and C-terminal amide and also contained
an additional C-terminal cysteine residue to allow
conjugation. Tat: GRKKRRQRRRPC, Pen:

MKWKKGGC were synthesized on a PerSeptive
Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesiser (100 mmol scale)
using standard Fmoc/tert-butyl solid phase synthesis
techniques as C-terminal amide peptides using NovaSyn
TGR resin (Novabiochem). Deprotection of all peptides
and cleavage from the solid support was achieved by
treatment with triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) in the presence
of triethylsilane (1%), ethane dithiol (2.5%) and water
(2.5%). Puriﬁcation was carried out by reversed phase
HPLC as previously described (9) and analysed by
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with the same matrix
as for PNA.

Conjugation of peptides with PNA
Thioether conjugations. In a typical conjugation reaction,
50 nmol bromoacetyl PNA was dissolved in 45 ml
formamide and 10 ml BisTris–HBr buﬀer (pH 7.5) and
15.6 ml C-terminal-Cys containing peptide (8mM,
125 nmol. 2.5 eq.) was added. The solution was heated
at 408C for 2 h and the product was puriﬁed by
reversed phase HPLC at 458C using water bath
heating and analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
(Supplementary Table S1).
Disulfide conjugations. These were carried out essentially
as previously described usually with a 2.5-fold excess of
peptide component over PNA component. Puriﬁcation
was carried out by reversed phase HPLC as above and
analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (21,30)(see
Supplementary Table S1).
Splice correction assay
This was carried out similarly to that described previously
(28). The conjugates (Table 1) were incubated for 4 h
in 1ml OptiMEM medium with exponentially growing
HeLa pLuc705 cells (1.75 105 cells/well seeded and
cultivated overnight in 24-well plates). The conjugates
were then diluted with 0.5ml complete medium (DMEM
plus 10% fetal bovine serum) and incubation continued
for 20 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
lysed with Reporter Lysis Buﬀer (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). Luciferase activity was quantiﬁed with a Berthold
Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad
Wildbad, Germany) using the Luciferase Assay System
substrate (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Cellular protein
concentrations were measured with the BCATMProtein
Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and read using an
ELISA plate reader (Dynatech MR 5000, Dynatech Labs,
Chantilly, VA, USA) at 550 nm. Levels of luciferase
expression are shown as relative light units (RLUs) per
microgram protein. All experiments were performed in
triplicate. Each data point was averaged over the three
replicates.
Cell permeability assay (Flow cytometry analysis)
To analyse the cell permeabilization of CPP–PNA
conjugates, exponentially growing HeLa pLuc705 cells
(3 105 cells seeded and grown overnight in 30mm plates)
were incubated for 4 h with the CPP–PNA705 conjugates
at diﬀerent concentrations. The cells were then washed
twice with PBS, detached by incubating with trypsin for
5min at 378C (0.5mgml1)/EDTA.4Na (0.35mM), and
washed by centrifugation (5min, 900  g) in ice-cold PBS
containing 5% FCS. The cell pellet was resuspended in
ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% FCS and 0.05mg/ml
propidium iodide (PI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR,
USA). Fluorescence analysis was performed with a BD
FacsCanto ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). A minimum of 20 000 events per sample were
analysed.
RT–PCR analysis of splice correction
HeLa pLuc705 cells were plated at 30 000 cells/well in
a 24-well plate 24 h before treatment. After overnight
incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated
in 1ml OptiMEM containing 1 mM of the indicated
conjugates (naked PNA705, Pen-s-s–PNA705, R6Pen-s-
s–PNA705, R6Pen-s-s–PNA705scr or R6Pen(W–L)-s-s–
PNA705) for 4 h and the conjugates were then diluted with
0.5ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS and allowed to
grow for 20 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS.
Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the High
pure RNA isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science). The
extracted RNA was examined by RT-PCR (MJ Research
PTC200 Peltier Thermal cycler) with forward primer
50TTG ATA TGT GGA TTT CGA GTC GTC30 and
reverse primer 50TGT CAA TCA GAG TGC TTT TGG
CG30. The products were analysed on a 2% agarose gel
(Figure 7A).
For dose-dependence experiments (Figure 7B), cells
were treated as described above with increasing concen-
trations of R6Pen-s-s–PNA705 or R6Pen–PNA705
conjugates. After carrying out the luciferase assay and

BCATM Protein Assay, the remaining cell lysates (about
270ml) were transferred into 2ml microfuge tubes and
total RNA was extracted with 1ml TRI Reagent (Sigma).
Minor changes to the manufacturer’s protocol were made
to accommodate the presence of Reporter Lysis Buﬀer.
Thus, 0.3ml of chloroform was used for extraction and
the amount of iso-propanol for RNA precipitation was
increased to give a 1:1 mixture with the aqueous phase.
The RT-PCR was carried out as described above and
agarose gels were scanned using Gene Tools Analysis
Software (SynGene, Cambridge, UK).
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows a comparison of the splice correction
activities at 1 mM concentration of unconjugated PNA705,
K8-PNA705 and Tat-PNA705, the activity of each of
which is known to be chloroquine-dependent (9,17,18,23),
together with R6Pen–PNA705 and (R-Ahx-R)4–PNA705
(19) in the absence of an endosomolytic agent. In all cases,
PNAs were conjugated to the carrier peptides through
stable amide or thioacetyl linkages (Table 1 for construct
details). R6Pen conjugate, and to a lesser extent (R-Ahx-
R)4 conjugate, gave rise to a strong up-regulation of
luciferase under conditions where K8 and Tat peptide
conjugates were essentially inactive. Note that the scale of
light units is shown in relative light units per microgram
protein, demonstrating the very high level of activity seen
for R6Pen–PNA705. The low level of activity for Tat-
PNA705 agrees with results recently reported by two other
laboratories, where similarly low splice correction was
seen also for Penetratin, R9 and Transportan at 1 mM
concentration (17,18) and only at 5–10 mM concentrations
did some conjugates (notably Transportan) show signiﬁ-
cant splice correction activity. Thus, R6Pen appears
substantially more eﬀective as a CPP and leads to much
stronger splice correction activity compared to our
previously used (R-Ahx-R)4–PNA705.
The splice correction activity of the R6Pen conjugate is
sequence-speciﬁc, since no splice correction activity is seen
when this CPP vector is conjugated to a scrambled version
of PNA705 (Figure 2). Note that luciferase activity levels
vary somewhat between experiments as pointed out by
Bendifallah et al. (17). Normalization of the data to the
basal luciferase expression in untreated cells, as proposed
by these authors, gives rise to much less apparent
variation between experiments (see Supplementary Data,
Figures 1 and 2), but we have chosen here to show
un-normalized values just to demonstrate the high activity
levels.
To characterize further the properties of the R6Pen–
PNA705 conjugate, we monitored the dose-dependence of
splice correction, as measured by luciferase up-regulation,
at concentrations between 0.1 and 2.5mM (Figure 3).
R6Pen–PNA705 allows an eﬃcient dose-dependent splice
correction activity in the absence of chloroquine (Figure 3,
white bars) under conditions where no toxicity was seen,
as judged by measurement of PI uptake by ﬂow cytometry
(Supplementary Data, Figure 3). The proportion of
permeabilized cells remained 53% as compared to the
untreated controls in cells incubated with the various
CPP–PNA conjugates at 1 mM (e.g. at the concentration
allowing almost complete splicing correction). The
addition of chloroquine improved the splice correction
activity, which demonstrates that some of the conjugate
still remains entrapped in endosomal compartments in
keeping with an endocytotic mechanism of cell uptake.
However, the incremental improvement in splice
correction activity aﬀorded by chloroquine addition was
somewhat smaller at the higher concentrations
(approximately 2- to 3-fold, Figure 3, grey bars), than
those we obtained previously with K8 and Tat conjugates
of PNA or PMO, where a 10-fold increase or more was
often observed (19,23).

We next investigated the importance of the stability of
the linkage between the delivery peptide and the PNA
cargo. It has been suggested by others that if a disulﬁde-
linked conjugate is able to escape from the endocytic
compartments and reaches the cytosol, the disulﬁde bridge
might be reduced, thus allowing free PNA to be released
(31). A new conjugate R6Pen-s-s–PNA705 (Table 1) was
therefore constructed with a linker containing a disulﬁde
bridge, similar to that which we have previously used in
studies of HIV-1 Tat-dependent trans-activation inhibi-
tion (21). This conjugate was tested in the splice-correction
assay in parallel with the stably linked R6Pen–PNA705
and indeed showed a slightly (but reproducibly) higher
activity (Figure 4). However, the relatively small
diﬀerence demonstrates that the nature of the linkage
is not a principal factor governing splice correction
activity. Nevertheless, we decided to use the more active
disulﬁde-bridged conjugates for further studies on the
structure–function relationship.
In order to determine the eﬀect of the N-terminal Arg
stretch on splice correction activity, we constructed a series
of R(z)Pen-s-s–PNA705 conjugates with z {0, 3, 6 and 9}.
These R(z)Pen-s-s–PNA705 conjugates were tested at 0.5
and 1 mM in the splice correction assay in the absence of
chloroquine (Figure 5). Pen-s-s–PNA705 at 1 mM displays
only a very weak activity, consistent with previous results
of others (17,18). The activity level is strongly enhanced by
the addition of an Arg tail by factors of 16, 43 and 28 for
z=3, 6 and 9, respectively. Thus, at 1 mM concentration,
the optimum activity is obtained for R6. No signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were seen in cell toxicity for any of the
conjugates at this concentration as judged by ﬂow
cytometry and PI uptake (Supplementary Data, Figure 3).
Previous studies (29) have shown that the substitution
of the tryptophan residues that occurs naturally in the
Antennapaedia homeodomain helix 3 sequence by a
leucine residue decreased the cell internalization of
Penetratin peptide. Surprisingly, the R6Pen(W–L)-
s-s–PNA705 conjugate displayed a slightly higher splicing
correction activity than the unmodiﬁed R6Pen–PNA705
(Figure 6). This indicates that the Penetratin part of the
R6Pen–PNA conjugate has a completely diﬀerent eﬀect in
enhancement of membrane permeabilization when it is
located within the PNA conjugate context as compared to
the Penetratin peptide alone.
In most studies using the HeLa-pLuc705 model,
splice-correction is monitored by the quantiﬁcation of
luciferase luminescence activity (17–19,22,23,28).
However, this assay gives only a relative appreciation of
splice correction activity between diﬀerent conjugates. In
contrast, use of RT-PCR allows the evaluation of the
completeness of splice correction by comparison of the

been used with this splice correction assay for cationic
lipid-based transfection methods (11,32). We, therefore,
carried out RT-PCR on RNA samples extracted from

lanes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In contrast, a very high
proportion of correctly spliced mRNA was found in cells
treated with 1 mM R6Pen-s-s–PNA705 (lane 4) or with
R6Pen(W–L)-s-s–PNA705 (lane 6).
The dose-dependences of splice correction for R6Pen-s-
s–PNA706 and stably linked R6Pen–PNA705 were
assessed by the RT-PCR assay (Figure 7B). The EC50s
of splice correction at the RNA level were estimated as
0.7 0.3mM and 1.0 0.3 mM, respectively. EC50s were
also estimated from the amounts of conjugate required to
raise the luciferase luminescence levels to 50% of the
observed plateaux values (data not shown). These values
were found to be 0.9 0.2 mM and 1.0 0.2 mM,
respectively.
DISCUSSION
The nuclear delivery of steric-block ON analogues
conjugated with most CPPs for splice correction or exon
skipping has been hampered by endosome trapping, unless
an endosome disturbing drug or peptide is added, or high
CPP–PNA conjugate concentrations are used. Bearing in
mind the key role played by cationic amino acids for CPP
uptake, we have appended varying numbers of arginine
residues to the N-terminal end of Penetratin, a CPP which
by itself does not impart on the PNA a signiﬁcant amount
of splice correction ability. R6Pen turned out to be the
most active. The level of activity obtained for splice
correcting conjugated PNA is higher than for all other
CPPs tested to date, including the recently described
(R-Ahx-R)4 vector (19,28). Remarkably, R6Pen–PNA705
conjugates are highly active at 1 mM concentrations in the
absence of any endosomolytic agents.
Quantiﬁcation of luciferase expression, as carried out
here and also in most published work to date, is a sensitive
and convenient assay, which allows one to compare
several conjugates quickly in terms of eﬃciency or
speciﬁcity, and is thus the method of choice for
structure–activity relationships studies. However, such
data are expressed in relative light units and do not allow
direct determination of the extent to which aberrant
splicing has been corrected. RT-PCR products from the
aberrantly and correctly spliced luciferase pre-mRNA can
be separated easily by agarose gel electrophoresis, thus
allowing evaluation of the extent of splice correction
under various conditions. RT-PCR data closely parallel
luciferase luminescence measurements and indicate that
the R6Pen-ss–PNA705 and the W!L variant allow
sequence-speciﬁc splicing correction at 1 mM concentra-
tion to a high level (about 60–70%), whilst PNA705 alone
or Pen-s-s–PNA705 are totally inactive. The levels of
activity we have obtained (EC50 of 0.7–1.0mM) now start
to approach those obtained with the same assay by
cationic lipid transfection using leashed PNA or other
modiﬁed ON types (11,32).
The achievement of a fair proportion of correction at
low conjugate concentration is a key issue in the
development of steric block ONs as potential therapeutics.
By use of PI as an index of membrane permeabilization,
we have indeed veriﬁed that R6Pen did not perturb
membrane integrity of HeLa cells at the active dosage.
Previous studies from our group have established that
high (45 mM) concentrations of CPP–ON as R9 or K8–ON

led to signiﬁcant increase of PI uptake thus precluding
further developments (23).
We have no explanation at this stage for the dramati-
cally increased splice correction activity of R6Pen as
compared to Pen or as compared to several Arg-rich
CPPs. It is worth emphasizing in this respect that the
W!L mutation in the Penetratin moiety, which is known
to inhibit Penetratin peptide uptake (29), does not aﬀect
splice correction by R6Pen–PNA705 and instead gave rise
to a slightly higher activity (Figures 6 and 7), thus
inferring diﬀerent mechanisms by which this CPP
operates. Along the same lines, chloroquine has a
signiﬁcantly lower eﬀect on splice correction by R6Pen–
PNA705 (Figure 3) as compared to Tat-PNA705 (19) or
K8-PNA705 (23), in keeping with its improved intrinsic
endosomal escape. We are also able to rule out signiﬁcant
eﬀects of the Lys residues on the PNA part on splice
correction activity. Indeed we have found recently that
R6Pen disulﬁde linked to a PNA 18-mer containing just
one Lys residue on each end behaved identically to the
corresponding conjugate containing four Lys residues
(data not shown). Further mechanistic studies are in
progress, but it should be noted that we have deliberately
avoided on these conjugates the use of ﬂuorescent labels,
which are commonly used to track cellular uptake by
confocal microscopy. Such labels alter the hydrophobicity
of the conjugate at a particular region. This may alter the
ability of the PNA-peptide to be released from endosomal
compartments. Concerns about this have emerged recently
in the case of our parallel studies on inhibition of HIV-1
Tat-dependent trans-activation (21). We have been unable
so far to construct a conjugate that contains a ﬂuorescein
label on the PNA part of a R6-Penetratin–PNA conjugate
targeted to TAR without losing all intra-nuclear inhibition
activity in the absence of chloroquine in our HeLa cell
assay (Turner, J.J., Arzumanov, A.A., Ivanova, G.D. and
Gait, M.J., unpublished results). Further, there does not
appear to be a strong correlation of the amount of
ﬂuorescent oligonucleotide reagent seen to be taken up by
cells and their biological activity (21,23,25,28), as has also
become apparent in the design of lipid-based reagents for
delivery of siRNA (33). Thus, more sophisticated ways of
tracking locations of nucleic acids-based reagents and
determining the precise compartments where activity takes
place will be needed before such types of experiment
become fully meaningful.
Whether CPP delivery peptides and their cargoes should
be conjugated through stable or unstable linkers has often
been debated, but few direct comparisons have been
provided. In our case, a disulﬁde-linked conjugate was
slightly (but reproducibly) more active than a stably
conjugated PNA. Thus, we are now in the process of
carrying out further more detailed structure–function
analyses using such disulﬁde linkers to try to understand
how the various parts of the R6-Penetratin peptide
contribute to obtaining intra-nuclear splice correction
activity. The disulﬁde linker strategy may also be less
susceptible to problems arising from steric interference by
the conjugated delivery vehicle, or from potential non-
speciﬁc binding of the vector to non-targeted entities.
However, use of PNA–peptide conjugates in vivo may
require a more stable linkage and our work shows that a
thioacetyl linker is also compatible with high-level splice
correction activity.
The fact that strong splicing correction (as judged by
the RT-PCR analysis) can be achieved at much lower
(1mM) concentration of the correcting ON than has
previously proved possible opens up promising perspec-
tives for in vivo applications. We hope that further
optimization of the peptide–PNA construct will lead to
a construct suitable for in vivo studies, and eventually for
instance towards the treatment of disease-associated
splicing defects [cancer, thalassemia, etc. (34)] or in
exon-skipping strategies, as are now being considered for
the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (35,36).
