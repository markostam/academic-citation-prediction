ABSTRACT
The type II restriction endonucleases form one of
the largest families of biochemically-characterized
proteins. These endonucleases typically share little
sequence similarity, except among isoschizomers
that recognize the same sequence. MmeI is an unu-
sual type II restriction endonuclease that combines
endonuclease and methyltransferase activities in a
single polypeptide. MmeI cuts DNA 20 bases from
its recognition sequence and modifies just one DNA
strand for host protection. Using MmeI as query we
have identified numerous putative genes highly sim-
ilar to MmeI in database sequences. We have cloned
and characterized 20 of these MmeI homologs.
Each cuts DNA at the same distance as MmeI and
each modifies a conserved adenine on only one DNA
strand for host protection. However each enzyme
recognizes a unique DNA sequence, suggesting
these enzymes are undergoing rapid evolution of
DNA specificity. The MmeI family thus provides a
rich source of novel endonucleases while affording
an opportunity to observe the evolution of DNA
specificity. Because the MmeI family enzymes
employ modification of only one DNA strand for
host protection, unlike previously described type II
systems, we propose that such single-strand
modification systems be classified as a new sub-
group, the type IIL enzymes, for Lone strand DNA
modification.
INTRODUCTION
The type II restriction endonucleases and methyltrans-
ferases constitute a large and widely distributed family
of enzymes (1). These enzymes are under strong selective
pressure as a primary defense against parasitic DNA.
They may also function to control the exchange of genetic
material between ‘self’ and ‘others’ within microbial popu-
lations (2). As such they represent fertile ground for the
study of protein evolution, particularly the evolution
of those protein–DNA interactions that confer sequence
speciﬁcity to these enzymes.
A restriction system must diﬀerentiate between ‘self’
and ‘foreign’ DNA in order to cut the identiﬁably foreign
DNA but not host DNA. This discrimination is based
upon modiﬁcation of the DNA, usually in the form of
methylation of a base in each strand within the discrete
DNA sequence recognized by the endonuclease. Usually,
hemi-methylated DNA is not cut by the type II endonu-
cleases, ensuring that immediately following replication
the hemi-methylated daughter chromosomes remain pro-
tected from cleavage by the endonuclease, allowing the
DNA methyltransferase time to modify the newly repli-
cated strand. Type II R–M systems most commonly have
separate enzymes to accomplish host DNA modiﬁcation
and endonuclease cleavage of foreign DNA. However,
some systems, such as some members of the type IIG
subgroup, have one polypeptide that contains both
DNA methyltransferase and endonuclease activity, part-
nered with a second, companion DNA methyltransferase
(3,4). The type IIG enzymes generally recognize asymmet-
ric sequences and cut away from the recognition sequence.
The fusion proteins cut fully unmodiﬁed DNA, but can
also modify a base in one DNA strand of unmodiﬁed
DNA. Because the recognition site is not disrupted by
the endonucleolytic cleavage, they can remain bound to
and modify their recognition site even after cutting the
DNA. However, previously described type IIG endonu-
cleases, such as Eco57I, require a separate, companion
DNA methyltransferase in order to achieve modiﬁcation
of both DNA strands, since the single-strand modiﬁcation
produced by the fusion protein is insuﬃcient for host
protection (5).
Since most bacteria and archaea possess one or more
restriction systems, the recent availability of complete
genome sequences has provided a wealth of putative
restriction systems. These are typically identiﬁed in silico

through amino-acid sequence similarity to conserved
sequence motifs within the DNA methyltransferase. The
type II DNA methyltransferases exhibit signiﬁcant amino-
acid sequence similarity in the regions involved in binding
the methyl donor AdoMet and the catalysis of methyl
transfer, which allows uncharacterized putative sequences
to be reliably identiﬁed as DNA methyltransferases (6,7).
However, the type II restriction endonucleases (REs)
are generally not similar at the level of primary amino-
acid sequence, even though many share a conserved struc-
ture (8). Type II REs typically exhibit a low level of
sequence identity that falls in the so-called ‘twilight
zone’ of sequence similarity, where genuine similarities
between homologs disappear into the random noise of
sequence comparison (9,10). Although signiﬁcant similar-
ity between putative and characterized endonucleases
is occasionally observed, such enzymes are usually isoschi-
zomers, i.e. they recognize the same DNA sequence and
cut at the same position. For most type II REs, however,
the lack of sequence conservation makes identiﬁcation
of these enzymes among the many putative sequences
available in sequenced genomes a challenging task (11).
It was therefore surprising that after cloning the unu-
sual type II endonuclease MmeI (12), we observed a
number of highly similar putative sequences in available
databases. Expression and characterization of these
MmeI-like putative genes has allowed us to describe a
new family of type II restriction enzymes. These enzymes
employ the unusual strategy of using only single-strand
methylation for host protection, a property not previously
described for type II R–M systems. Modiﬁcation of only
one DNA strand raises the question of how host protec-
tion is maintained, since immediately following replication
one of the two daughter chromosomes will be fully unmo-
diﬁed and would be expected to be vulnerable to restric-
tion. However the MmeI-like systems described appear
frequently in sequenced bacterial genomes, and it appears
from bioinformatic analyses that such single-strand mod-
iﬁcation for host protection may be widespread in nature.
The diversity of recognition sequences found in this clo-
sely related family of proteins aﬀords a unique window
into the evolution of speciﬁc protein–DNA-binding
interactions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Restriction endonucleases, S-adenosyl-L-methionine
(AdoMet), T4 DNA Ligase, DNA polymerases, DNA
size standards and competent cells were from New
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Synthetic DNA oligonu-
cleotides were from New England Biolabs, Organic
Synthesis Division (Ipswich, MA) or Integrated DNA
Technologies (Coralville, IA). [methyl-3H]-AdoMet was
from GE Healthcare (Pittsburgh, PA). Gamma-33P-ATP
was from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA). Plasmid prepara-
tion and DNA puriﬁcation spin columns were from
Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and Zymo Research (Orange,
CA). UltracleanTM Soil DNA isolation kits were from
MoBio Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA).
Endonuclease assays
Endonuclease activity was assayed by incubating various
amounts of enzyme in reaction buﬀer (NEBuﬀer 4: 20mM
Tris–acetate, pH 7.9, 10mM magnesium acetate, 50mM
potassium acetate, 1mMDTT, supplemented with 100 mg/
ml BSA and 80 mM AdoMet) containing 1 mg substrate
DNA per 50 ml for one hour at 378C. Reactions were ter-
minated by addition of stop solution (50mM EDTA, pH
8.0, 50% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue), and reac-
tion products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1%
LE agarose gels alongside DNA size standards lambda-
HindIII and PhiX174-HaeIII, or lambda-BstEII and
pBR322-MspI.
Identification of MmeI homologs in sequence databases
The MmeI protein sequence (GenBank accession no
ACC85607) served as the query to identify signiﬁcantly
similar protein sequences using BLAST searches per-
formed against available databases, such as the non-
redundant protein sequences (nr) or the environmental
samples (env-nr) amino-acid sequence databases at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),
the REBASE database of restriction systems (1), or
TBLASTN searches against the Nucleotide collection
(nr/nt) or environmental samples (env-nt) DNA databases
at NCBI (13). Signiﬁcant hits with an expectation value
<e–20 were considered potential MmeI homologs. The
putative homologs were evaluated to identify those
sequences that contained the conserved PD-(D/E)xK
endonuclease motif residues, aligned with the putative
MmeI catalytic residues D70, E80 and K82 in the amino
terminal region, and that exhibited similarity throughout
the entire length of MmeI. A number of the identiﬁed
putative MmeI homologs were cloned and expressed in
Escherichia coli.
Cloning and expression of MmeI homologs
The microbial strain, or the genomic DNA from the
strain, encoding a MmeI homolog of interest was obtained
from the source listed in Table 1. Where puriﬁed genomic
DNA was not available, DNA was prepared from a
freshly grown cell culture by standard techniques
or directly from a lyophilized ATCC or DSM culture
vial by chemical lysis and bead beating (MoBio
Laboratories, CA). For environmental sequences, where
neither genomic DNA nor the microbial strain was avail-
able, the putative endonuclease gene was obtained by
in vitro synthesis.
Putative genes were PCR ampliﬁed from genomic
DNA. The oligonucleotide sequences used for expression
are listed in Supplementary Table T1. The ampliﬁed genes
were cloned into one of several expression vectors, such as
the high copy number pUC19 derivative pRRS (14) or the
T7 expression based vectors pAII17 (15) or pSAPv6 (16),
and transformed into an appropriate E. coli host, such
as ER2683 (F0proA+B+ lacIq D(lacZM15) (KanR)

T7 expression vectors. Transformed cells were grown and
tested for endonuclease activity.
Protein puriﬁcation: clones expressing endonuclease
activity were grown, induced, harvested and disrupted
by sonication. The expressed endonuclease was puriﬁed
over a Heparin HiTrap column (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ). The crude extract supernatant was
applied to the column in buﬀer A (20mM Tris–HCl, pH
7.5, 1mM DTT, 0.1mM EDTA) containing 50mM KCl.
The column was then washed with ﬁve-column volumes
buﬀer A containing 50mM KCl, then the enzyme was
eluted with a 20–40 column volume linear gradient from
50mM to 1M KCl in buﬀer A. The enzymes typically
eluted from the heparin column between 0.3 and 0.4M
KCl. The fractions containing puriﬁed enzyme were used
for subsequent characterization of the DNA recognition
sequence and the position of DNA cleavage.
Correction of disrupted open reading frames
The putative ORFs reported in the database sequences for
several of the identiﬁed MmeI homologs were less than the
expected length when compared to the amino-acid
sequence of MmeI or other active MmeI homologs;
however in silico translation of all three frames of the
DNA sequence adjacent to these incomplete ORFs
revealed protein coding sequences similar to the entire
MmeI protein sequence. The potential full-length ORF
for three disrupted homologs; NmeAIII, DraRI and
ApyPI, and the position and nature of the putative dis-
ruption to the ORF, was predicted by comparison of
amino-acid translations of the DNA sequences with an
amino-acid sequence alignment of the active MmeI
family members. The putative ORFs were cloned from
the start to stop positions and tested for expression; how-
ever none of the genes expressed active endonuclease. The
disruption to the reading frame present in the database
was conﬁrmed by sequencing the clones, indicating the
genes are in fact disrupted in the organism sequenced
and not mere sequencing errors. In the case of a frame
shift, the potential amino-acid sequence for all three
frames in the region of the putative frame shift was com-
pared to the aligned sequences of the active MmeI family
members to identify the position where signiﬁcant similar-
ity to the aligned homologs changed from one reading
frame to a diﬀerent frame. The choice of amino-acid resi-
due(s) to place at the correction point was guided by pla-
cing the amino-acid residue(s) observed in one or more
of the most similar homolog sequences into the correction
position. Corrections to the putative disruptions were then
introduced into the cloned genes using mutagenic primers
with the PhusionTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit.
Determination of DNA recognition sequence
The recognition sequence for each enzyme was determined
by mapping positions of cleavage in several DNAs, typi-
cally pUC19, pBR322, PhiX174 and pBC4, followed by
analysis to identify sequences that occur at the mapped
cutting positions but not elsewhere in the DNAs (17,18).
The putative recognition sequences were conﬁrmed by
comparing the observed fragments obtained by cleavage
of larger DNA substrates having multiple sites, such as
lambda, phage T7 or phage T3 DNAs, to the predicted
fragments generated by cutting at the putative recognition
sequence.
Determination of endonuclease cutting position
The location of DNA cleavage relative to the recognition
sequence for each enzyme was determined through
dideoxy sequencing analysis of the terminal base sequence
obtained from cleavage of a DNA substrate at each of
several diﬀerent recognition sites (19). Sequencing was
performed on an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer using the
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. DNAs
having a recognition site for the endonuclease located
between 100 and 600 bp 30 to each of a pair of sequencing
primers were chosen for analysis. The DNA was cut by the
endonuclease, puriﬁed over a spin column and eluted and
its concentration adjusted to 100 mg/ml. Two DNA
sequencing reactions were performed for each recognition
site; one with a top strand primer to locate the endonu-
clease’s position of cutting relative to the recognition
sequence on the bottom strand, and one with a bottom
strand primer to locate the position of cutting on the top
strand.
Determination of DNA methyltransferase product
The methylated base produced by the DNA methyltrans-
ferase activity of the MmeI homologs was tested for
13 enzymes using antibodies speciﬁc for N6-methyl ade-
nine or N4-methyl cytosine. An unmodiﬁed substrate, T7
DNA, was in vitro modiﬁed by these enzymes in reaction
buﬀer lacking magnesium. A reaction to which no enzyme
was added served as a negative control, while reactions
with MmeI and M.TaqI served as positive controls for
N6-adenine methylation. A plasmid DNA expressing
M.EsaBC4I, which modiﬁes a cytosine in the sequence
50-GGCC-30 at the N4 position (1), served as the positive
control for the N4-methyl cytosine antibody. The modiﬁed
DNAs were puriﬁed over a spin column and 0.45 mg,
0.15 mg and 0.05 mg of the modiﬁed DNAs were spotted
onto nitrocellulose ﬁlters. Antibodies speciﬁc for
N6-methyl adenine or N4-methyl cytosine were incubated
with the DNAs and detected as previously described (20).
Determination of genomic DNA methylation status for
Rhodopseudomonas palustris BisB5 (RpaB5I) and
Pseudomonas species OM2164 (PspOMII)
Genomic DNA from host cells expressing two of the
characterized enzymes was examined to determine if any
modiﬁcation was present in either the top strand or the
bottom strand of the enzyme’s recognition sequence to
protect against the endonuclease activity of the endonu-
clease. For PspOMII, 20 mg genomic P. species OM2164
DNA was digested with HincII and EcoO109I to produce
a discrete 502 bp fragment that contained two PspOMII
recognition sites oriented in the same direction. Fragments
between 400 and 600 bp were excised from an agarose

gel and puriﬁed over a spin column. For synthesis of
unmodiﬁed top strand PspOMII sites, 1 pmol of a top
strand primer (#7, Supplementary Table T1) was 50 end
labeled with 33P-g-ATP (NEG302H) using T4 polynucleo-
tide kinase in a 30 ml reaction. The kinase was inactivated
by heat treatment at 808C for 20min. One-half of the gel
puriﬁed, HincII and Eco0109I cut P. species OM2164
genomic DNA was placed in 500 ml 1 Phusion HF reac-
tion buﬀer containing 0.25mM dNTPS and ﬁve units
Phusion HotStart DNA polymerase. The reaction mix
was denatured at 988C 1min, then held at 948C while the
1 pmol of labeled primer was added, then the primer was
annealed and extended for 5min at 728C. The DNA was
puriﬁed over a spin column. The same procedure was per-
formed for synthesis of unmodiﬁed bottom strand
PspOMII sites using a complement strand primer (#8,
Supplementary Table T1). Two 500 ml endonuclease reac-
tion mixtures were formed, one for the top strand synthesis
and one for the bottom strand synthesis. Each contained
the labeled hybrid DNA in NEBuﬀer 4 supplemented with
80 mMAdoMet, BSA and 40 nM of a 31 bp dsDNA having
a PspOMII recognition site (annealed oligonucleotides #11
and #12, Supplementary Table T1) and divided into ﬁve
equal portions. The ﬁrst received no enzyme (negative con-
trol), the second four units PspOMII, the third two units
PspOMII, the fourth 10 units BanII (positive control),
while the ﬁfth aliquot was mixed with reaction mixture
from the opposite strand and digested with eight units
PspOMII (positive control for PspOMII activity).
Following digestion the DNA was concentrated using a
spin column. The products were resolved on a 6% acryla-
mide TBE gel alongside PhiX-HaeIII size standard that
was previously end labeled with 33P, the gel was dried
onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane and the products
detected by autoradiography. The same experimental
approach was performed for R. palustris BisB5 genomic
DNA. The R. palustris BisB5 DNA was cut with BsrBI
(at genome coordinates 3593567 and 3593936) to generate
a 369 bp fragment containing one RpaB5I site. The primers
used were #9 and #10, and the small dsDNA containing an
RpaB5I site was formed from oligonucleotides #13 and
#14 (Supplementary Table T1). For RpaB5I, 1 Phusion
GC reaction buﬀer supplemented with 3% DMSO was
substituted for 1 Phusion HF buﬀer.
Cleavage on single site substrates: activation by in
trans DNA
Short dsDNAs having a recognition site for RpaB5I
or NmeAIII were supplied in trans to reactions containing
RpaB5I and the single site substrate pBR322, or NmeAIII
and the three-site substrate pBR322. Oligonucleotides
were synthesized in pairs and annealed to form a
dsDNA that contained the RpaB5I site (oligonucleotides
#13 and #14) or the NmeAIII recognition site (oligonu-
cleotides #15 and #16, Supplementary Table T1). These
recognition site containing DNAs extended 14 bases 30 to
the recognition site, which is six or seven bases short of the
point of DNA cleavage. The NmeAIII site DNA, which
lacked an RpaB5I site, was tested with RpaB5I as a neg-
ative control. One microgram (0.35 pmol, 7 nM RpaB5I
sites) linear pBR322 DNA (PstI cut) was digested in a
50 ml reaction with 2 to 0.25 units RpaB5I in the absence
of the small DNAs, in the presence of 2 pmol (40 nM)
RpaB5I site DNA or in the presence of 2 pmol (40 nM)
NmeAIII site DNA (no RpaB5I site) as a negative control.
Similarly one microgram linear pBR322 DNA (PstI cut)
was digested in 50 ml reactions with two units RpaB5I
and a 2-fold dilution of the RpaB5I site DNA from
2pmol (40 nM) to 0.0625 pmol (1.25 nM). One microgram
(0.35 pmol, 21 nM NmeAIII sites) pBR322 DNA was
digested in a 50 ml reaction with a 2-fold dilution of
NmeAIII from 32 to 0.5 units in the absence of the small
NmeAIII site DNA. Similarly one microgram pBR322
DNA was digested in 50 ml reactions with 16 units
NmeAIII and a 2-fold dilution of the NmeAIII site DNA
from 32 pmol (640 nM) to 1 pmol (20 nM) per reaction. The
extent of cleavage was determined on a 1% agarose gel.
Bioinformatic analysis of MmeI homologs
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of MmeI family
enzymes was performed using the PROMALS web
server (21). Structure prediction for the MmeI protein
was performed using the PHYRE web server (22,23).
The phylogeny of the characterized enzymes was analyzed
using distances calculated by PROMALS in performing
the MSA. The genome context for the MmeI homologs
was analyzed by examining the predicted genes located
within 5 kb on either ﬂank of the identiﬁed MmeI
homologs.
RESULTS
Identification of putative MmeI-like restriction
endonuclease genes
A BLASTP search using the protein sequence of MmeI
as query against the non-redundant GenBank database
returned more than 100 sequences that produced highly
signiﬁcant expectation values of E< e–20. The identiﬁed
putative sequences were annotated as ‘hypothetical pro-
teins’ or ‘putative DNA methyltransferases.’ While it
might be expected that the DNA methyltransferase por-
tion of the bi-functional MmeI protein would produce
matches to DNA methyltransferase genes because these
contain conserved sequence motifs, none of the top 100
hits included typical type II DNA methyltransferases.
Many of the putative sequences identiﬁed, and especially
the highest scoring sequences, were highly similar to
MmeI throughout their entire protein sequence, including
the endonuclease and DNA recognition domains. The
identiﬁed protein sequences were aligned and two groups
were identiﬁed. The ﬁrst was similar to the entire MmeI
protein and contained conserved amino-acid residues of
the PD–ExK endonuclease family in their amino terminal
domain that aligned with those of MmeI and with each
other. Sequences in the second set did not contain the PD–
ExK endonuclease motif and diﬀered from MmeI in their
ﬁrst 100 amino-acid residues yet were highly similar to
MmeI and the ﬁrst set of putative genes throughout the
rest of their sequences. No additional DNA methyltrans-
ferase genes were observed ﬂanking either set of MmeI

homologs. No particular genes consistently ﬂanked the
homologs that contained the endonuclease domain
motif. However, the set of homologs that lacked the
endonuclease motif, such as YeeA (GenBank accession
no NP_388558) from Bacillus subtilis, were ﬂanked by
two conserved genes; one identiﬁed as a putative DNA
helicase, similar to YeeB of B. subtilis (GenBank accession
no AAB66475), and a second identiﬁed as a conserved
hypothetical protein similar to YeeC of B. subtilis
(GenBank accession no AAB66476). Selected sequences
were cloned into E. coli for expression and
characterization.
Characterization of novel restriction endonucleases
We have identiﬁed, expressed and characterized 20 novel
restriction endonucleases. For each new enzyme the name,
recognition sequence and DNA cleavage position, source
organism, protein accession number and source of geno-
mic DNA is presented in Table 1. Of the 20 newly dis-
covered enzymes, 19 have unique DNA speciﬁcities not
previously known for type II restriction–modiﬁcation
(R–M) systems. The one exception, AquIII [50-GAGGA
G(20/18)], recognizes the same DNA sequence as BseRI
[50-GAGGAG(10/8)] but cuts the DNA at a diﬀerent posi-
tion, making it a neoschizomer to BseRI. While each
enzyme recognizes a diﬀerent sequence, some of the rec-
ognition sequences diﬀer at only one base position, while
others diﬀer at every position except the penultimate ade-
nine that is the target for the DNA methyltransferase
activity of these proteins. The enzymes all required
AdoMet for endonuclease activity. An example of recog-
nition sequence determination is shown in Figure 1.
The positions of the single RpaB5I cut in pBR322, and
the four cuts in pBC4, were mapped by cutting the DNAs
with RpaB5I and restriction enzymes having a single site
in these DNAs. The sequence CGAGGAC or CGGGGA
C was found to occur only at the mapped positions in
these DNAs, and did not occur in two other DNAs,
pUC19 and PhiX174, that were not cut by RpaB5I. The
observed fragment sizes produced by RpaB5I digestion
of larger DNA substrates such as lambda, T7 and T3
matched the predicted fragment sizes for cutting at
CGRGGAC, conﬁrming that this is the speciﬁc recogni-
tion sequence for RpaB5I.
The enzymes all cut DNA at essentially the same posi-
tion relative to their recognition site, that is 20 (1) bases
30 to the recognition sequence in the top DNA strand that
contains the adenine that is methylated, and two bases 30
to this top strand cut in the bottom strand, to produce a
two-base 30 extension. The exact position of DNA scission
can vary by one base at diﬀerent sites for each enzyme,
dependent upon the sequence that occurs between the rec-
ognition site and cleavage point. An example of run oﬀ
sequencing to determine the cleavage position relative to
the recognition sequence is shown for RpaB5I, which cuts
at 50-CGRGGAC(20/18)-30 (Figure 2). For many of the
enzymes variability of one base longer or shorter than the
typical (20/18) reach was observed for cleavage at diﬀerent
sites, and some sites showed a mixture of cutting length
products, for example at (21/19) and (20/18). The cleavage
distance most frequently observed for each enzyme is
reported in Table 1; however it should be understood
that an enzyme reported as (21/19) may cut some sites
at (20/18) and vice versa.

Two members of the set of sequences that do not con-
tain the PD–ExK endonuclease motif, YeeA of B. subtilis
and MslORFHP of Moraxella osloensis NEB722, were
similarly expressed but no endonuclease activity was
observed.
Activation of inactive native genes
Three enzymes were activated from open reading frames
that were found to be disrupted in the particular isolate
used for genomic sequence determination. The DNA
sequence reported in the database leading to the interrup-
tion in the coding frame was conﬁrmed for all three cases.
Successful prediction of where to introduce changes and
what speciﬁc changes to make to correct the reading
frames of these enzymes was possible due to the signiﬁcant
sequence conservation found among members of this pro-
tein family. Only a single base change was necessary to
change early termination stop codons to coding codons
for NmeAIII and DraRI. For NmeAIII the early termi-
nation TAG stop codon at amino-acid position 32 of the
full length ORF was changed to TGG (tryptophan) using
primers 1 and 2 (Supplementary Table T1). The early
termination codon TAA at position 841 in DraRI was
corrected to GAA using primers 3 and 4 (Supplementary
Table T1). ApyPI contained a frame shift following R886
that was corrected by the addition of two bases, GC, to a
run of three GC dinucleotides (GCGCGC changed to GC
GCGCGC) using primers 5 and 6 (Supplementary Table
T1). Individual transformants carrying the corrected
genes were tested for endonuclease activity and found
to express active endonuclease. Deinococcus radiodurans
genomic DNA was tested and found to be cleaved
in vitro by the activated DraRI endonuclease, indicating
the DNA methyltransferase activity of DraRI is not active
in vivo in the host Deinococcus strain.
DNA methyltransferase activity produces N6-adenine
methylation
The conserved DNA methyltransferase motifs in the
expressed MmeI-like enzymes are those of the amino
DNA methyltransferases, and are most similar to the
gamma class of N6-methyl adenine DNA methyltrans-
ferases. Fourteen enzymes were tested and conﬁrmed to
produce N6-methyl adenine by the use of antibodies spe-
ciﬁc for N6-methyl adenine (Figure 3A). None of these
enzymes produced any detectable N4-cytosine methyla-
tion (Figure 3B). The antibody results conﬁrm that the
enzymes in this family modify adenine at the N6 position
to form N6-methyl adenine (m6A).
Genome context of MmeI family homologs
None of the genes expressed have an additional DNA
methyltransferase gene in close proximity to the single
polypeptide coding for the fused endonuclease–DNA
methyltransferase enzyme. Furthermore, no one con-
served gene, putative or characterized, is observed to
co-localize with the 20 characterized endonuclease
genes in their genome context. The absence of a nearby

methyltransferase gene is consistent with the observation
that all the systems tested use only the single-strand DNA
modiﬁcation produced by the bi-functional enzyme for
host protection. Indeed, 15 of the characterized enzymes
do not have an adenine base in the complement strand
that could serve as a target for m6A modiﬁcation, while
one member of this family, BsbI, has neither adenine nor
cytosine bases in the complement strand.
Modification of host DNA occurs on only one DNA
strand of the duplex recognition sequence
Host genomic DNA was examined for the presence or
absence of modiﬁcation able to protect against endonu-
clease cleavage in each DNA strand of the recognition
sequence. DNA substrates that consisted of a hybrid of
one strand of host genomic DNA, which will carry the
respective DNA modiﬁcation present in the host cell,
and one newly synthesized and therefore un-modiﬁed
DNA strand, were produced from a single round of
primer extension on host genomic DNA for RpaB5I
and PspOMII. Both enzymes cut the hybrid DNAs in
which the bottom strand of the recognition sequence,
50-GTCCYCG-30 for RpaB5I and 50-YTGGGCG-30 for
PspOMII, was derived from their host genomic DNA
and the top strand was newly synthesized, indicating the
host DNA has no modiﬁcation present in the bottom
strand of the recognition sequence to block cleavage by
these enzymes (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure S2). DNA
in which the top strand of the recognition sequence,
50-CGRGGAC-30 for RpaB5I and 50-CGCCCAR-30 for
PspOMII was located in the host-derived genomic
strand and the bottom strand was newly synthesized
were not cut by these enzymes, indicating modiﬁcation is
present in the top strand to prevent cleavage. The same
results were observed previously for MmeI (12). These
results indicate that only the top strand adenine modiﬁca-
tion produced by the DNA methyltransferase activity of
the bi-functional enzymes is present in their respective
host DNA and able to block cleavage. No additional mod-
iﬁcation is present in the host DNA on the bottom strand
of the enzyme’s recognition sequence to block endonu-
clease activity. This observation is consistent with the
absence of a co-localized companion DNA methyltrans-
ferase in the genome sequence context of these enzymes
and the lack of a conserved adenine base target for mod-
iﬁcation in the bottom strand of their recognition
sequences. These results conﬁrm that the entire modiﬁca-
tion used by the RpaB5I, PspOMII and MmeI restriction
systems, and by inference all members of this family of
R–M systems, is the methylation of only the one con-
served top strand adenine produced by these single poly-
peptide, bi-functional enzymes themselves.

MmeI family enzymes requires two sites for efficient
DNA cleavage
Some type II endonucleases bind individual recognition
sites and cleave their sites independently. Others require
two or more sites for eﬃcient cleavage, with the multiple
sites either acting cooperatively to eﬀect cleavage, or with
one site binding to an eﬀector position in the endonuclease
to eﬀect a conformational change required for DNA
cleavage competence (4,24–26). The cleavage eﬃciency
on DNA substrates containing single or multiple recogni-
tion sites was compared.
All the enzymes tested cleaved a single site DNA incom-
pletely, achieving between 10 and 70% cleavage even with
excess enzyme. For example, RpaB5I cuts its single site in
pBR322 DNA only partially (Figure 5A). In contrast, the
same single site DNA is nearly completely cleaved when
a second recognition site is provided in trans by adding
a synthetic DNA containing the RpaB5I recognition
site (Figure 5B and C). The DNA bearing the recognition
site need not be capable of being cleaved itself, as a DNA
having only 14 bases 30 to the recognition site facilitates
cleavage of the single site plasmid as well as a DNA
extending to or beyond the position of cleavage.
Cleavage stimulation is dependent upon the presence of
the enzyme’s speciﬁc recognition sequence, as addition of
a similar DNA lacking an RpaB5I site did not increase
cleavage (Figure 5D). For RpaB5I the concentration of
sites supplied in trans needed to stimulate cutting of the
single site DNA was approximately equimolar (0.01 mM)
with the concentration of recognition sites (0.007 mM)

in the single site DNA (Figure 5C), in a reaction that
contained two units of RpaB5I. These results are quite
similar to those obtained for MmeI (12).
Several of the enzymes characterized, such as NmeAIII
and PspOMII, cut even a multiple site substrate incomple-
tely, producing a stable, partial digestion pattern even
with excess enzyme. For example, NmeAIII cuts
pBR322, which contains three sites, to a stable partial
digestion pattern that does not change even with 32-fold
excess enzyme (Figure 6A). NmeAIII cleavage of pBR322
is stimulated by the presence of its recognition site in trans,
as observed for MmeI and RpaB5I; however in contrast to
MmeI and RpaB5I, this stimulation requires an 10-fold
excess of both the enzyme and the in trans DNA in order
to drive the cleavage reaction on the pBR322 substrate to
completion (Figure 6B). These results indicate that while
all of the enzymes described require interaction between
two speciﬁc recognition sites for cleavage, there are subtle
diﬀerences in the endonuclease domains and their interac-
tions that aﬀect the extent of DNA scission produced.
Protein sequence features
The new enzymes described share many common features.
They are single polypeptides that encode both the DNA
methyltransferase activity required for host protection
and the endonuclease activity for cleavage of identiﬁably
foreign DNAs. The proteins are relatively large for type II
restriction endonucleases, ranging in length from 908
amino acids (SdeAI) to 1184 amino acids (RpaB5I). The
primary amino-acid sequences of the characterized
enzymes are quite similar, with ApyPI and CstMI sharing
76% identity, and many of the enzymes exhibiting
40–50% identities. The amino-acid sequences align well,
particularly when secondary structure predictions are
included in the alignment algorithm (Supplementary
Figure S1). The enzymes display a remarkable conserva-
tion of predicted secondary structure elements throughout
the entire alignment, while also displaying the ﬂexibility
common to restriction enzymes for accommodating inser-
tions of short sequence elements in individual enzymes
between regions of conserved sequence and secondary
structures.
The endonuclease domain is located at the amino
terminus of these proteins and contains the conserved
motifs of the PD-ExK endonuclease family. Secondary
structure prediction indicates the endonuclease domain
forms a structure containing four helices and ﬁve beta
strands in the order a-b-b-b-a-a-b-b-a, suggesting these
enzymes fall into the class III group of restriction endo-
nucleases proposed by Niv, et al. (8).The aspartate of the
PD–ExK motif is completely conserved and occurs at the
start of beta strand 2 (D70 in MmeI). The E and K are also
completely conserved and occur at the end of the third
beta strand (E80 and K82 in MmeI). Mutations to these
residues have recently been shown to abolish endonuclease
activity (27). There is a highly conserved (17 of 20) gluta-
mate residue at the c-terminal end of beta strand 1 (E51
in MmeI), though this is an aspartate in one case and a
glutamine in two of the enzymes. A completely conserved
glutamate also occurs just before the start of helix 2 (E25
in MmeI).
A second feature observed in the MSA is a region
of predominantly helical nature located between the endo-
nuclease domain and the methyltransferase domain, from
approximately amino acids 151–300 in MmeI. This region
is presumed to form the ‘arm’ that enables the enzyme to
position the endonuclease domain two turns of the DNA
helix, or 20 nt, away for DNA cleavage when the enzyme
is bound at the recognition sequence. This region shares

similarity to the amino terminal portion of the type I
DNA methyltransferases, suggesting an evolutionary rela-
tionship between the MmeI family and type I DNA
methyltransferases, as has recently been proposed (27).
The methyltransferase domain contains readily identiﬁ-
able amino-acid sequence motifs of the amino DNA-
methyltransferases. These motifs occur in the order
found in the gamma class of N6-adenine methyltrans-
ferases: motif X, motif I to motif VIII. Structure predic-
tion algorithms model the methyltransferase domain of
these enzymes onto the structure of the gamma class
m6A DNA methyltransferase M.TaqI (PDB: 1G38) with
high accuracy probabilities, indicating that the methyl-
transferase domain of these enzymes is typical of the
gamma m6A DNA methyltransferases. The methyltrans-
ferase domain corresponds to approximately amino acids
301–620 in MmeI.
In the type II gamma class m6A DNA methyltrans-
ferases, speciﬁc recognition is determined by the Target
Recognition Domain (TRD) located C-terminal to the
methyltransferase domain, as well as minor groove
contacts located between methyltransferase motifs IV
and V in the case of M.TaqI, while in the type I systems
recognition is supplied by a separate speciﬁcity polypep-
tide. For the enzymes described the TRD appears to imme-
diately follow the methyltransferase domain as in the type
II gamma class m6A DNA methyltransferases, correspon-
ding to approximately position 621–820 in MmeI. There is
remarkable conservation in the predicted secondary struc-
ture elements within the TRD region, indicating that the
enzymes are likely to contact the DNA using similar struc-
tural elements. The enzymes form two main branches in
a phlyogenetic analysis, with the enzymes recognizing
six-base sequences in one and those recognizing seven-
base sequences in the other, with the one exception of
DrdIV (Figure 7). The enzymes recognizing seven-base

sequences exhibit a small insertion of seven amino acids
and a small deletion of four amino acids relative to the six-
base enzymes within the putative TRD region.
The TRD appears to end at a conserved short sequence
motif, ‘FPFP’, that is reminiscent of the PLPPL motif
found in type I speciﬁcity subunits. The PLPPL motif
occurs at the transition from one-half site TRD to the
helical spacer arm that connects the two-half site TRD
domains (28). Following this ‘FPFP’ motif there is a
C-terminal region consisting of several predicted well-
conserved helices of unknown function.
DISCUSSION
We have identiﬁed a new family of restriction endonu-
cleases that have remarkably similar overall amino-acid
sequences yet recognize diﬀerent DNA sequences. The
enzymes cut DNA at the same 20 (1) base pair distance
downstream from their recognition site, making them
members of the type IIS subgroup of restriction enzymes.
They possess both endonuclease and DNA methyltrans-
ferase activities in the same polypeptide and require
AdoMet for endonuclease activity, making them members
of the type IIG subgroup as well. The enzymes recognize
6 or 7 nt long contiguous sequences. The eﬀective number
of base pairs speciﬁcally recognized ranges from 5.5 bp
to 7 bp, though there is a bias toward eﬀective recognition
of 6 bp, as among the enzymes recognizing bases at seven
positions, two uniquely specify recognition of only 6 bp,
six uniquely specify 6.5 bp, while only one uniquely speci-
ﬁes a unique base at all seven positions.
Modification of one DNA strand
Remarkably, enzymes in this family use modiﬁcation on
only one DNA strand for host protection. This allows a
single DNA recognition domain to direct both host pro-
tective methylation and endonuclease activity. However,
single-strand modiﬁcation would be expected to pose a
problem for the host, in that immediately following repli-
cation every recognition site will be completely unmodiﬁed
on one daughter duplex DNA molecule, and thus presum-
ably unprotected from the endonuclease activity of the
enzyme. It is currently unclear just how the host over-
comes this diﬃculty, though the requirement that
enzyme bound at two speciﬁc unmodiﬁed sites interact
for cleavage to occur may play a role. However, it is
clear that the MmeI-like restriction systems described
are viable and widespread in nature despite relying on
only single-strand modiﬁcation. While we believe these
enzymes to be in fact restriction systems, a restriction
phenotype has not been explicitly demonstrated in their
native hosts, though cloned MmeI has been reported to
restrict lambda phage in E. coli (27).
It appears likely that other type II restriction systems
also use single-strand modiﬁcation for host protection.
For example, TaqII [5-GACCGA(11/9) or CACCCA
(11/9) (29), Tth111II (CAARCA(11/9) (30) and TspGWI
(ACGGA(11/9)] (31) all lack an adenine base target for
modiﬁcation in the bottom strand of their recognition
sequences. Although the genome context of these three
systems is not available, close homologs for which ﬂank-
ing genomic sequence is currently available, such as
putative genes RPA3376 (accession no. NP_948715) or
TK1158 (accession no YP_183571), are not associated
with an additional ﬂanking DNA methyltransferase
gene. Bioinformatics analyses of available microbial
genome sequences indicate a wide range of putative RM
systems exists that potentially might use single-strand
modiﬁcation. Three rounds of an iterated Psi-BLAST
search using MmeI as the starting query returns greater
than 500 putative protein sequences, many of which, like
the MmeI family, have readily identiﬁable adenine DNA
methyltransferase motifs and are not ﬂanked by a second
DNA methyltransferase protein. A number of these have
an N-terminal domain that contains a PD–ExK endonu-
clease motif. Others lack an endonuclease motif but are
ﬂanked by a putative DNA helicase protein. Still others
are large single polypeptides that include a putative endo-
nuclease domain and helicase domain along with the
DNA methyltransferase and TRD. To date these systems
have received little attention or biochemical characteriza-
tion, yet their frequency would suggest they might have an
important biological role.
Evolution of the MmeI family of R–M systems
The MmeI-like systems described may represent a kind of
‘missing link’ in the evolution of R–M systems. The
remarkable similarity observed between the amino termi-
nal portions of the type I DNA methyltransferases, which
precedes the methyltransferase motifs, and the region in
the MmeI family proteins located between the endonu-
clease domain and the start of the methyltransferase
domain suggests a close evolutionary relationship. This
region is absent in typical type II gamma class DNA
methyltransferases, such as M.TaqI. In the MmeI family
this region presumably forms the ‘arm’ that positions the
endonuclease domain two turns of the helix away from the
recognition sequence, while in the type I systems it pre-
sumably functions in protein–protein subunit interactions.
The MmeI family enzymes thus resemble a type I DNA
methyltransferase with two domain additions. At the
amino terminus a PD–ExK endonuclease domain has
fused with the methyltransferase, while at the C-terminus
a speciﬁcity domain recognizing a contiguous DNA
sequence replaces the separate speciﬁcity subunit found
in type I systems. Some type IIG systems that, like their
type I counterparts, recognize split sequences still have a
separate speciﬁcity subunit, for example BcgI (32), while
in others the speciﬁcity domain is fused with the endonu-
clease–methyltransferase polypeptide, for example CjeI or
AloI (33).
The second group of MmeI homologs, that lack the
endonuclease motif in their amino terminal domain, may
represent a diﬀerent link with the type I systems. These are
invariably located next to two conserved putative genes
in their various genome contexts, suggesting that these
three putative proteins function together. One of these
conserved putative genes is similar to the DEAD
domain DNA helicase superfamily, CDD cl10452 (34).
The second conserved putative protein contains conserved

sequence motifs of the GIY-YIG endonuclease family
(35). We speculate that in these systems the MmeI-like
subunit provides DNA speciﬁcity and protective host
modiﬁcation, but in place of the PD-ExK endonuclease
domain this group presumably substitutes a domain that
interacts with the separate DNA helicase and endonu-
clease subunits to accomplish DNA scission. The architec-
ture of separate subunits and the presence of a DNA
helicase are similar to type I R–M systems; however, in
contrast to type I systems, these systems are likely to use
single-strand modiﬁcation like MmeI.
The MmeI family enzymes require interaction between
two molecules bound at speciﬁc recognition sites to
achieve cutting. This indicates the endonuclease domain
is released to interact with DNA only upon speciﬁc bind-
ing, suggesting there must be some intramolecular com-
munication resulting from speciﬁc binding. In the type I
DNA methyltransferase M.EcoKI, the N-terminal region
has been implicated in reading the methylation status of
the adenine at one half site and communicating this with
the second M.EcoKI molecule positioned at the adenine
on the opposite strand at the second half site, to direct the
EcoKI system into either modiﬁcation, if one DNA strand
is methylated, or endonucleolytic digestion if neither ade-
nine is modiﬁed (36). This type I N-terminal region is
similar to the MmeI family region between the endonu-
clease domain and methyltransferase domain. The MmeI
family enzymes have a completely conserved tryptophan
residue (W287 in MmeI, Supplementary Figure S1) that
aligns to M.EcoKI W115, which has been shown to partic-
ipate in the communication of the methylation status
in M.EcoKI (36). The conservation observed between
these groups of enzymes suggests that this region of the
MmeI-like enzymes preceding the start of the methyltrans-
ferase motifs may be involved in communicating the
methylation status of the recognition site to the endonu-
clease domain to activate this domain for cutting.
Distribution of the MmeI family of R–M systems
The identiﬁcation of these novel type II restriction
enzymes through the technique of ‘genome mining’
demonstrates the power of this sequence-based approach
for enzyme discovery. That twenty enzymes having
novel DNA speciﬁcity were isolated demonstrates many
novel type II restriction endonuclease enzymes still await
discovery.
Because type II restriction endonucleases generally
exhibit signiﬁcant protein sequence similarity only
among enzymes that recognize the same sequence, we
were surprised to ﬁnd the MmeI family enzymes all rec-
ognize unique DNA sequences. In the context of their
highly similar overall sequences, the diversity of DNA rec-
ognition observed indicates DNA speciﬁcity is evolving
rapidly within this family. Because the entire restriction
system of the MmeI family enzymes consists of a single
bi-functional protein in which DNA cutting and protec-
tive host modiﬁcation are directed from a common DNA
recognition domain, any alteration in the single DNA rec-
ognition domain will simultaneously alter both restriction
speciﬁcity for foreign DNA and methylation speciﬁcity
to protect host DNA. This coordination of protective
methylation and restriction activities from a common
DNA recognition domain, as in type I systems, ensures
host protection is available for any new restriction speci-
ﬁcity generated, which may explain the great diversity of
DNA speciﬁcity observed in this family. This capacity to
evolve new recognition speciﬁcity may confer a selective
advantage for organisms facing a rapidly evolving phage
challenge. The enhanced ability to evolve new speciﬁcity
may also explain the widespread occurrence of single-
strand modifying R–M systems in Nature despite the
potential deleterious eﬀects from production of unmodi-
ﬁed sites in one daughter strand following replication.
Three of the enzymes characterized have genes that are
disrupted in the host organism. When expressed directly
from the sequenced organism’s DNA these genes were
inactive. However, because the members of this family
share such a high degree of sequence similarity it was pos-
sible to predict the location of the lesions and correct the
disruption to form functional genes. The ability to form
active enzymes by a simple mutational event suggests these
genes have not degenerated. This implies that in a natural
population of microbes these enzymes may exist in both
an active form and an inactive, but readily repaired, form.
The active systems may confer a selective advantage in
periodic times of challenge by phage or parasitic DNAs.
The inactive form of these genes may represent drift in the
absence of selection; however such inactive genes might
also be particularly amenable to evolutionary changes
within their DNA recognition domain. Because the inac-
tive genes can be readily reactivated, their presence may
confer a selective advantage to whichever host cells
express active enzyme when the population experiences a
challenge from parasitic DNA.
Proposed new sub-group: type IIL
The MmeI family enzymes we describe modify only one
DNA strand to provide host protection. The absence of
protective modiﬁcation in the second strand has been
explicitly demonstrated for three enzymes, and is consis-
tent with both the observed absence of linkage to an
additional DNA methyltransferase for modiﬁcation of
the second strand, and the absence of an adenine base to
accept modiﬁcation in the second strand of the majority of
the enzymes. This family of enzymes thus has complete
reliance on the single-strand modiﬁcation provided by
the fused endonucleases–DNA methyltransferase protein
for host protection. This utilization of only single-strand
modiﬁcation for host protection is a newly described
characteristic among type II R–M systems. Based on
this feature we propose that such enzymes be classiﬁed
in a new sub group within the type II restriction enzymes,
the type IIL enzymes, where ‘L’ indicates Lone strand
modiﬁcation.
