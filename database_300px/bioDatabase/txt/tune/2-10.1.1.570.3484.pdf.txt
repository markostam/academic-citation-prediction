Metabolism, Sensitivity, Consumption, and Dependence
in Europeans

Background: The low-activity variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene found in
East Asian populations leads to the alcohol ﬂush reaction and reduces alcohol consumption and risk
of alcohol dependence (AD). We have tested whether other polymorphisms in the ALDH2 gene have
similar effects in people of European ancestry.
Methods: Serial measurements of blood and breath alcohol, subjective intoxication, body sway,
skin temperature, blood pressure, and pulse were obtained in 412 twins who took part in an alcohol
challenge study. Participants provided data on alcohol reactions, alcohol consumption, and symptoms
related to AD at the time of the study and subsequently. Haplotypes based on 5 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in tests of the effects of variation in the ALDH2 gene on alcohol
metabolism and alcohol’s effects.
Results: The typed SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium and 2 complementary haplotypes
comprised 83% of those observed. Significant effects of ALDH2 haplotype were observed for breath
alcohol concentration, with similar but smaller and nonsignificant effects on blood alcohol. Haplo-
type-related variation in responses to alcohol, and reported alcohol consumption, was small and not
consistently in the direction predicted by the effects on alcohol concentrations.
Conclusions: Genetic variation inALDH2 affects alcohol metabolism in Europeans. However, the
data do not support the hypothesis that this leads to effects on alcohol sensitivity, consumption, or
risk of dependence.

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL evidence that alcohol-related problems and risk of alcohol dependence
(AD) are related to alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolism
(Chen et al., 1999a, 1999b; Crabb et al., 1995; Thomasson
et al., 1991; Yin and Agarwal, 2001). A polymorphism of
the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene, ALDH2
Glu487Lys, reaches a minor allele frequency of about 30%
in East Asian populations and the corresponding ALDH
enzyme has low acetaldehyde-metabolizing activity. The
ALDH2487Lys allele (ALDH22) shows dominance
for loss of ALDH activity when heterozygous with the
ALDH2487Glu allele (Crabb et al., 1987; Farres et al.,
1994; Xiao et al., 1996). East Asian carriers of the
ALDH2487Lys allele consume less alcohol and have a
decreased risk of becoming alcohol dependent. This
ALDH2-related protection against drinking problems and
risk of AD is mediated through the unpleasant side effects
of drinking, including nausea and facial ﬂushing (Harada
et al., 1981; Higuchi et al., 1994; Yokoyama et al., 2005).
Apart from these physiological and behavioral effects,
there is evidence that ALDH2 deﬁciency causes a reduc-
tion in the rate of alcohol metabolism (Lehmann et al.,
1986; Luu et al., 1995; Mizoi et al., 1985; Mizoi et al., 1994;
Ueno et al., 1990; Yoshihara et al., 2000).
Even in Europeans, where the ALDH2487Lys allele is
not found (Oota et al., 2004), the acute effects of alcohol
(alcohol sensitivity or the level of response to alcohol)
inﬂuence alcohol use and dependence (Heath et al., 1999;
Schuckit and Smith, 1997; Whitﬁeld, 1997; Wilhelmsen
et al., 2003). Variation in alcohol and acetaldehyde metabo-

lism, including genetic variation in alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH) and ALDH, may contribute to variation in alcohol
sensitivity, although receptor effects may also be impor-
tant (Hu et al., 2005).
More generally, many theories about alcohol effects,
addiction, and the medical consequences of alcohol use
propose a key role for acetaldehyde (Eriksson, 2001).
These theories are difﬁcult to test directly because even
during alcohol metabolism, acetaldehyde concentrations
in human blood (except in people with ALDH2 deﬁciency)
are below the limits of quantitation for current analytical
methods. Therefore, genotyping and inferences about
alcohol metabolism based on the in vitro properties of
ADH and ALDH enzymes have had to supplement or
replace direct measurements. If variation in the human
ALDH gene—apart from ALDH2Glu487Lys—could be
shown to affect alcohol metabolism, short-term alcohol
effects, alcohol use and dependence, or long-term conse-
quences of alcohol use, this would be strong evidence that
acetaldehyde metabolism and acetaldehyde effects are
important even at submicromolar concentrations, which
we cannot measure reliably. This principle would hold
even if the alleles causing such effects are rare. The impact
on AD in the population, conversely, will be greater if the
alleles are common.
Based on these considerations, we have undertaken sin-
gle-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing of the ALDH2
gene in 376 subjects who took part in an alcohol challenge
study. A particular strength of this data set is the multiple
measurements of blood and breath alcohol, and of sensi-
tivity to intoxication, taken during the alcohol challenge
procedure and the longitudinal data on alcohol use and
dependence symptoms available for this cohort. Data
related to alcohol metabolism, short-term responses to
alcohol, and habitual alcohol use and AD have been used
to test for ALDH2 haplotype–associated differences. The
expected consequences of a low-activity form of ALDH2
are shown in Table 1, and these are used to test whether a
consistent pattern of effects is observed.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Alcohol Challenge Study
Measures of in vivo alcohol metabolism, physiological responses
to drinking, and self-report evaluation of intoxication were obtained
from 412 twins aged 18 to 34 years (mean 23) who took part in the
Alcohol Challenge Twin Study (ACTS) in 1979 to 1981 (Martin
et al., 1985a, 1985b). Ten timed readings for breath alcohol level and
6 for blood alcohol level were obtained starting 20 minutes after
ingestion of alcohol (0.75/kg body weight) (Martin et al., 1985a).
Participants gave a subjective assessment of their intoxication at 1, 2,
and 3 hours after the start of drinking by giving their response to the
question ‘‘How drunk are you now?’’ on a 10-point scale (15 ‘‘quite
sober’’ to 105 ‘‘the most drunk I have ever been’’). Physiological
measures and tests of motor coordination were also included. Base-
line measurements were obtained for heart rate, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, skin temperature, and body sway (eyes open)
40 minutes before alcohol ingestion, and postalcohol measurements
were obtained at 1, 2, and 3 hours after the start of drinking. Body
sway measures were adjusted for height and weight (Martin et al.,
1985b).
Alcohol Reactions
A measure of physiological response possibly associated with the
effects of acetaldehyde was obtained from a follow-up questionnaire
in 1990. Subjects were asked whether they experienced unpleasant
reactions after drinking (ﬂushing of the face or body, itching, drow-
siness, or palpitations; answered as ‘‘always,’’ ‘‘sometimes,’’ or
‘‘never’’). A composite score (FA-1, n5 334) was constructed that
reﬂected any of 4 symptoms and their frequency in decreasing order
of magnitude (‘‘always,’’ ‘‘sometimes,’’ or ‘‘never’’).
Data on Alcohol Use and Dependence
Multiple measures of alcohol consumption and symptoms related
to AD were obtained over the period 1979 to 1998. We follow the
abbreviations previously used by Whitﬁeld et al. (1998), but have
extended the set of variables to include additional measures of alcohol
consumption or use. The responses to the individual questionnaires
were incomplete for these measures, but 86% of the cases had at least
6 measures available. At the time of the initial (I) alcohol challenge
study and before drinking the alcohol dose, participants provided
2 measures of consumption (C), namely the number of drinks usually
taken in a week (IC-1, n5 410) and the frequency and quantity of
alcohol use (IC-2, n5 407). Alcohol Challenge Twin Study subjects
completed a follow-up (F) questionnaire in 1990 to 1992 that
provided 3 measures of alcohol consumption: the number of drinks
in the previous week (FC-1, n5 337), the frequency and quantity of
alcohol use (FC-2, n5 311), and the number of drinks usually taken
in a typical week (FC-3, n5 338). They also provided their lifetime
symptoms of AD (FD-1, n5 345) and the maximum number of
drinks ever taken in a day (FC-4, n5 317). From 1992 to 1996, most
ACTS subjects participated in a larger study that included the
structured SSAGA (Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics
of Alcoholism) interview (Bucholz et al., 1994; Heath et al., 1997);

this provided the number of AD symptoms (SD-1, n5 337) and the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual—Third Edition—Text Revision
(DSM-III-R) diagnosis of AD (n5 337). Measures of the quantity
and frequency of alcohol use (SC-1, n5 344) and the number of
drinks consumed in the previous week (SC-2, n5 247) were obtained
in the 1992 to 1996 study. Two further measures of the weekly number
of drinks consumed were obtained for ACTS subjects as part of postal
questionnaire studies in 1980 to 1982 (Jardine and Martin, 1984)
(FC-5, n5 261) and in 1989 (Heath and Martin, 1994) (FC-6,
n5 230). The data were transformed to log10(x11) to reduce skew-
ness in the distributions. All intake and dependence variables were
converted to normalized scores for analysis so that the different meas-
ures could be compared on a common scale of measurement.
Genotyping
Blood forDNA extraction and SNP genotyping was obtained at the
time of follow-up (1990 to 1992) or after the SSAGA interview (1993
to 1995). While ACTS subjects were the main target, available parents
and siblings were also asked to provide blood samples to help identify
haplotype phase. Genotyping was carried out on DNA from one or
both members of 82 monozygotic (MZ) pairs and 106 dizygotic (DZ)
complete twin pairs. A further 7 DZ families had only 1 member of the
twin pair available for genotyping. The genotypes for MZ pairs were
identical and validated the reliability of the genotyping method. Only
25 twin pairs (14 MZ and 11 DZ) were genotyped without either
additional nontwin siblings or a parent. In all, 376 of 412 twins (91%)
in the original ACTS were genotyped, along with 213 of their nontwin
siblings and 228 of 412 parents (55%). Phenotypic data were not ob-
tained from nontwin siblings or parents.
Six SNPs (identiﬁed by their dbSNP ‘‘rs’’ number; see Table 2 and
Fig. 1) located within and 50 to the ALDH2 gene (chromosome
12q24.2) were selected for genotyping. The functionally important
polymorphism ALDH2Glu487Lys characteristic of East Asian eth-
nicity was one of them, but the 487Lys allele was not present in our
sample. SNPs were typed with the MassARRAY genotyping plat-
form (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA), with an average 0.4%
dropout rate and estimated o0.1% genotyping error rate. Tests on
parents (where available) and for the entire genotyped population
using PEDSTATS (Wigginton and Abecasis, 2005) showed good

Tests of Allelic Effects
A maximum likelihood method, implemented in the software Mx
1.54 (Neale, 1999), was used to estimate jointly the effects of individ-
ual SNPs or haplotypes in the means part of the model of the
multivariate likelihood equation as well as components of the resid-
ual phenotypic covariance. The categorical variables AD and FA-1
were analyzed using the ordinal data option. The expected model for
the covariance structure was parameterized forMZ and for DZ twins
following the classical model for additive genetic (A) and both
familial (C) and individual-specific environmental (E) effects, and
hypotheses about means were tested in the context of this random
effects model. As the focus of this paper is on the ﬁxed effects of
ALDH2 polymorphisms, random effects variance components are
not reported here (but see Martin et al., 1985b). Spurious allelic
association due to population admixture was tested for by partitioning
the effect for overall association into within-family and between-
family effects (Fulker et al., 1999). The effects of the within-sib-pair
and between-sib-pair components of genetic association were found
to be homogeneous in all tests, suggesting that stratiﬁcation is not a
concern; hence we report only the results of tests for the overall
associations.
Multivariate analysis of genetically correlated phenotypes (the
multiple measures of blood or breath alcohol, of physiological
responses to alcohol, and of alcohol intake and dependence symp-
toms) was performed as an extension from the univariate analysis
implemented in Mx (Birley et al., 2005). The strength of this
approach is that the repeated measures reduce the error variance
and increase power to detect allelic or haplotype association. Tests
for haplotype effects were carried out in stages by equating their
effects across time (for repeated measures), equating effects of
haplotypes within 2 major groups (Group 1 and Group 2, deﬁned
below), and ﬁnally equating values for Group 1 and Group 2. At
each stage, the change in goodness of ﬁt between the data and the
model was assessed using the chi-square test.
RESULTS
Linkage Disequilibrium and Haplotype Frequencies
Substantial linkage disequilibrium between the typed SNPs
was conﬁrmed (Table 3). Seven haplotypes were detected, of
which 3 (ATTCT, GTCCT, and GCCTC) had a frequency
over 10%. These 3 accounted for 95% of observed haplo-
types. Similarly only 3 main haplotypes (at frequencies
410%) were observed by Oota et al. (2004) using 4 ALDH2
SNPs in 38 populations excluding East Asians.
The strong linkage disequilibrium for the 5 polymorphic
SNPs identiﬁes 2 main haplotypes in our sample, one of
which (ATTCT) shows complete association for all 5 com-
mon alleles and the other (GCCTC) complete association
for the rare allele at all 5 loci (Fig. 2). This ‘‘yin yang’’
haplotype architecture is characteristic of 75% to 85%
human gene coding regions (Zhang et al., 2003) and was
used in tests of the effects of diplotypes that captured the
dominance relationships identiﬁed by preliminary analysis
of individual SNPs. (Diplotypes are the haplotype equiva-
lent of a genotype for a single polymorphism and consist,
in this case, of the 5-base combination for each of the
2 chromosomes.)
The implied pathway of evolutionary change in haplo-
type sequence (Fig. 2) was used to construct a series of tests
for haplotype effects. Haplotype GCCTC represents the
complete association of all rare alleles at the 5 SNP loci.
We postulate that a recessive mutation causing variation in
ALDH activity has arisen within haplotypes other than
ATTCT. This mutation must be in linkage disequilibrium
with our set of SNPs and associated with the GCCTC
haplotype. Under this model, all diplotypes with 1 copy of
the ATTCT haplotype are classiﬁed as Group 1 diplo-
types. Heterozygous diplotypes involving the GCCTC
haplotype but excluding the ATTCT haplotype (classiﬁed
as Group 2 diplotypes) will be recessive to Group 1 diplo-
types in their effects.

of the 5 SNP loci showed that the effect of the rarer SNP
alleles was always recessive and in the direction of higher
alcohol levels. This is summarized in Table 2, which shows
the mean values for area under the concentration–time
curve (AUC) for breath alcohol, by genotype at each SNP.
The frequency of the minor allele for SNPs rs737280 and
rs2238151 was highest and these SNPs therefore showed
the strongest effect.
We expect the effect of Group 1 diplotypes (het-
erozygous with the common haplotype) to be small and
that it can be dropped from the model; i.e., its effect will be
similar to that of the ATTCT/ATTCT diplotype. Con-
versely, we expect the effects for Group 2 diplotypes to be
homogeneous and to be an estimate of the effect of the
postulated recessive mutation. We have used this model as
a test of consistency of gene effects identiﬁed by our diplo-
type groupings in the analysis of all the alcohol-related
phenotypes.
The effects of either diplotype group on breath or blood
alcohol levels were independent of sample measurement
times and the estimated effect sizes could be constrained
equal over measurement times (Table 4). There was no
evidence of a difference between the homozygous diplo-
type ATTCT/ATTCT and diplotypes from Group 1 in
either breath or blood alcohol levels; effect sizes were 0.33
and 1.08 mg/100 ml, respectively, compared against the
homozygous ATTCT/ATTCT diplotype. There was a
strong effect of diplotype Group 2 on breath alcohol levels
with an effect size of 6.04 mg/100 ml, p5 0.0005 (again,
compared against ATTCT/ATTCT). The effect of Group 2
diplotypes on blood alcohol concentration was in the same
direction, but smaller (2.72 mg/100 ml, averaged across all
times) and not statistically significant ( p5 0.103). For both
breath and blood, the Group 2 diplotypes were associated
with higher alcohol levels (Fig. 3).
Self-reported Intoxication
The intoxication reports at 1 and 2 hours after alcohol
intake corresponded to times when alcohol levels were
greatest, and the effects of the haplotype groups on self-
report intoxication were largest at 1 hour. Analysis for
effects of haplotypes, following the procedure described
for alcohol levels, did not reveal any heterogeneity of
effects within diplotype groups and measurement times.
The results showed a clear reduction of mean level of
self-reported drunkenness with measurement time
(as expected) and some effects associated with Group 2
diplotypes. As both effect size and alcohol level were great-
est at the ﬁrst measurement time, we consider this to be the
most appropriate time for the measurement of diplotype
effects. The effect size for Group 2 diplotypes at 1 hour
postalcohol was 0.78 (lower intoxication ratings in
Group 2), with an associated w21 ¼ 2:85 ( p5 0.09).
Skin Temperature, Pulse Rate, Systolic and Diastolic Blood
Pressure, and Body Sway
The physiological effects of alcohol were measured
through skin temperature, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, and standing steadiness or body sway. The effect
of sex was included in the means model. Diplotype effects
were again investigated by testing for homogeneity of
effects within the 2 diplotype groupings and within times
and also between diplotype groups. None of these com-
parisons was statistically significant. The effect of changes
of diplotype effect with time was tested by equating the
estimates of diplotype association across times within
diplotype groupings and between diplotype groupings.
Once again there was no evidence of an effect of diplo-

types. The pooled effect sizes for Group 2 diplotypes were
all small and only 1 comparison of 60 tests was nominally
significant, namely that for homogeneity of haplotype
groups for body sway (w21 ¼ 4:68, p5 0.03).
Alcohol Reactions
Haplotype groupings were internally homogeneous in
their effect on alcohol reactions. Although the mean score
for subjects with Group 1 diplotypes was not statistically
significantly different from that for the ATTCT/ATTCT
reference group (effect size5 0.02), the effect of Group 2
diplotypes (effect size5 0.48) was at borderline signiﬁ-
cance ( p5 0.052). Hence Group 2 diplotypes were
associated with a slightly increased prevalence of alcohol-
related reactions.
Effects on Alcohol Consumption, Symptoms, and AD
Phenotypic correlations among the 12 measures of
alcohol intake and 2 measures of dependence-related
symptoms were generally within the range 0.5 to 0.7, con-
sistent with ﬁndings from a larger study (Whitﬁeld et al.,
2004). The effects of diplotypes were homogeneous across
the multiple occasions of assessment and between the
various measures of alcohol intake and dependence symp-
toms. Group 2 effects were slightly greater than those for
Group 1 (i.e., higher intake and more symptoms), but the
difference was not significant ( p5 0.292). There was no
significant effect of the ALDH2 diplotype groups on AD.
DISCUSSION
We investigated the effects of variation in ALDH2
because it is a clear candidate gene for AD and sensitivity
to alcohol’s effects. It codes for the second enzyme in the
alcohol metabolic pathway, and the enzyme deﬁciency
resulting from the ALDH22 allele is associated with pro-
tection from AD in East Asians. We hypothesized that
ALDH2 genetic variation in other populations (and, in
principle, among ALDH21 homozygotes in Asia) may
produce lesser degrees of activity reduction and acetalde-
hyde accumulation, which would affect subjective and
objective responses to alcohol, and ultimately alcohol use
and dependence. Because of reports of ALDH2 deﬁciency
affecting blood alcohol as well as blood acetaldehyde
concentrations, we investigated ALDH2 haplotype and
diplotype effects on blood and breath alcohol. The postu-
lated effects of an ALDH2 haplotype associated with
decreased ALDH2 activity are shown in Table 1 and form
the basis for evaluation of our results.
Our major ﬁnding is that a group of diplotypes, charac-
terized by the GCCTC pattern of SNP types and the
absence of ATTCT, are associated with higher breath
alcohol, and possibly with higher blood alcohol, concent-
rations after a standardized dose of alcohol. We propose
that a variant of ALDH2 associated with these Group
2 haplotypes has an effect on ethanol oxidation. It is
important to note that this ALDH2 effect is homogeneous
across time (see Fig. 3); hence it must affect the early phase
of alcohol metabolism in the stomach or in the ﬁrst pass
through the liver, rather than the subsequent linear decline
in alcohol concentrations. It should also be noted that
because of substantial linkage disequilibrium between the
SNPs typed, differences in the p values (Table 2) cannot be
used to infer the exact location of the causative variant.
This effect on blood and breath alcohol concentrations
is consistent with data on the effects of the ALDH2
Glu487Lys polymorphism in Asians (Lehmann et al.,
1986; Luu et al., 1995; Mizoi et al., 1985; Mizoi et al.,
1994; Ueno et al., 1990; Yoshihara et al., 2000). Although
some of these reports are on few subjects, and there is
diversity in the measures of alcohol metabolism reported
(blood and breath alcohol concentrations, peak blood
alcohol, AUC, b60, or whole-body ethanol metabolic
rate), they are consistent in ﬁnding that ALDH-deﬁcient
states are associated with a decrease in alcohol metabo-
lism. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of ALDH in
people without a genetic deﬁciency in enzyme activity has
been shown to produce a small (10%) but significant
decrease in the rate of alcohol metabolism (Jones et al.,
1988). Therefore, the association that we have found
between ALDH haplotype or diplotype and breath or
blood alcohol concentrations is consistent with an ALDH
variant occurring in Europeans and affecting acetaldehyde
metabolism. The mechanism leading to an inﬂuence of
ALDH2 upon the action of ADH in the ﬁrst step of
ethanol oxidation is unclear, but may involve product
inhibition of ADH by acetaldehyde or a mass-action
effect on the rate of the forward (ethanol to acetaldehyde)
reaction (Umulis et al., 2005).
Raised acetaldehyde levels due to a variant of ALDH2
should lead to an increased perception of acetaldehyde
through ﬂushing and related characteristics and (if the
concentration is high enough to be aversive) to reduction
in alcohol consumption and risk of AD. These were tested
through physiological and psychomotor measurements
during the alcohol challenge and by the participants’ sub-
sequent reports of alcohol reactions, alcohol intake, and
AD. We therefore have a series of predictions based on the
known effects of the Asian ALDH22 polymorphism and
with the direction of effects for each haplotype group pre-
dicted by the observed significant effects on breath
alcohol. However, the effects on these downstream meas-
ures of ALDH2 variation (summarized in Table 5) were at
best marginally significant and were sometimes in the
opposite direction to our predictions. We have to conclude
that ALDH2 variation in Europeans does not have a
major effect on alcohol sensitivity, use, or dependence.
Although our 2 ﬁndings may appear to be in conﬂict,
consideration of the probable relationship between intra-
cellular acetaldehyde concentration and the rate of alcohol
metabolism suggests that a decrease in rate of 10% could
1098 DICKSON ET AL.
be caused by an increase in acetaldehyde concentration of
around 10%. Such an increase would have only small
effects on subjective perceptions of intoxication, physio-
logical measurements, alcohol use, and dependence risk.
The change in alcohol metabolism is however large enough
to be detected by this experimental protocol and our meth-
ods of data analysis.
