ABSTRACT
The Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN, http://
zfin.org), the model organism database for zebra-
fish, provides the central location for curated
zebrafish genetic, genomic and developmental
data. Extensive data integration of mutant pheno-
types, genes, expression patterns, sequences,
genetic markers, morpholinos, map positions,
publications and community resources facilitates
the use of the zebrafish as a model for studying
gene function, development, behavior and disease.
Access to ZFIN data is provided via web-based
query forms and through bulk data files. ZFIN is the
definitive source for zebrafish gene and allele
nomenclature, the zebrafish anatomical ontology
(AO) and for zebrafish gene ontology (GO) annota-
tions. ZFIN plays an active role in the development
of cross-species ontologies such as the phenotypic
quality ontology (PATO) and the gene ontology (GO).
Recent enhancements to ZFIN include (i) a new
home page and navigation bar, (ii) expanded
support for genotypes and phenotypes, (iii) compre-
hensive phenotype annotations based on anatomi-
cal, phenotypic quality and gene ontologies, (iv) a
BLAST server tightly integrated with the ZFIN
database via ZFIN-specific datasets, (v) a global
site search and (vi) help with hands-on resources.
INTRODUCTION
The zebraﬁsh is an established model for studies in
vertebrate biology. Signiﬁcant contributions are made to
the identiﬁcation and characterization of genes and
pathways involved in development, organ function,
behavior and disease. As the zebraﬁsh model organism
database, ZFIN facilitates research by providing a central
database and a uniform interface to integrate and view
the large amount of diverse data (1). ZFIN data derive
from expert manual curation of scientiﬁc literature,
collaboration with major resource centers and submissions
from individual investigators. Curation is an ongoing
eﬀort with daily updates and enhancements. All data are
attributed to their primary source. Annotations using
controlled vocabulary terms from biomedical ontologies
are a part of our routine curation eﬀorts. These
annotations provide a standardized data representation
that enables cross-species comparisons. Extensive links
to outside resources from ZFIN data pages further
enhance cross-species comparisons. Data curated at
ZFIN are also available through centers such as NCBI/
Entrez Gene (2), Vertebrate Genome Annotations (Vega)
(3) and the Ensembl (4) and UCSC (5) genome browsers.
A NEW LOOK AT ZFIN
ZFIN’s new home page serves as a hub for online
zebraﬁsh resources. Major enhancements include:
improved grouping and prioritization of ZFIN’s most
popular resources based on community input and page
usage statistics; prominent access to the Zebraﬁsh
International Resource Center (ZIRC); expanded
genome resource links and a ‘News’ section. The three-
tab navigation bar available on all ZFIN pages provides
convenient traversal of ZFIN and ZIRC pages.
ZFIN welcomes contributions to our ‘News’ section.

EXPANDED SUPPORT FOR GENOTYPES
AND PHENOTYPES
Support for mutant and transgenic ﬁsh has been
expanded to include complex genotypes containing
multiple mutations, zygosity and transgenic constructs.
Major enhancements include:
Mutants/Transgenics query interface
This query interface (http://zﬁn.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?
MIval=aa-ﬁshselect.apg&line_type=mutant) provides
the most comprehensive access to genotype and phenotype
data. Mutant/Transgenic queries may include gene or
allele name, chromosome, mutagen, mutation type and
anatomical structures that are aﬀected. Queries may
be performed on both mutants and transgenics or
constrained to either characterized mutants or transgenics.
The query results page provides summary data and
relevant links including allele name, parental zygosity,
mutation type, aﬀected gene, mapping position and
curated phenotypes.
Genotype page
This new page is the hub for genotype-speciﬁc data for
the more than 5000 genotypes described in ZFIN
(Figure 1). Genetic background, parental genotypes,
aﬀected genes and current sources for ﬁsh with this
genotype are listed. Links to all phenotype and gene
expression data associated with the genotype are
included. A ‘Genotype Details’ section lists aﬀected
genes, zygosity, parental zygosity, mutation type,
mutagen protocol, lab of origin and mapping information
for each allele. Links to construct pages are provided
for transgenic genotypes. Mutant/Transgenics query
results, phenotype and gene expression details pages and
gene pages link to the genotype page.
Construct page
This new page provides information about transgenic
constructs including regulatory regions, coding sequences,
associated lines and related publications.
Gene page
A ‘Mutants and Targeted Knockdowns’ section has
been added to the gene page. This section contains links
to all associated genotypes and phenotypes. Anatomical
ontology (AO) (1) and gene ontology (GO)(6) terms
describing the phenotype are summarized. Knockdown
reagents are listed.
Phenotype summary page
Thumbnail images, genotype details, parental zygosity,
supporting publications and links to aﬀected structures
and processes that characterize the phenotype can be
accessed from this new page (Figure 2). Detailed
phenotype annotations can be viewed by following the
thumbnail or ﬁgure links. This page can be accessed from
gene, morpholino and genotype pages.
Figure 1. The genotype page summarizes genotype speciﬁc data for mibta52b/ta52b and provides extensive cross-linking to all mibta52b/ta52b data
in ZFIN.

Anatomy page
Links are available from anatomy pages to mutant and
transgenic genotypes with related phenotypes.
Nomenclature
A consistent and informative system for naming genotypes
and transgenic constructs has been developed in consulta-
tion with the Zebraﬁsh Nomenclature Committee. These
conventions are described at: http://zﬁn.org/zf_info/
nomen.html.
COMPREHENSIVE PHENOTYPE ANNOTATIONS
Phenotype data from mutant screens and morpholino
studies make the zebraﬁsh a powerful model for elucida-
ting gene function in development and disease. The
correlation of zebraﬁsh phenotype data with human
genes and genetic syndromes is a major goal of zebraﬁsh
research. Our approach will facilitate cross-species
comparisons by providing a comprehensive and consistent
framework for phenotype annotation and queries.
Ontologies, hierarchical controlled vocabularies,
provide the structure required for consistent annotations
and subsequent comparisons. Ontologically derived
annotations are successfully used by model organism
databases to enhance computational and manual
data analyses. GO annotations are an integral part of
ZFIN’s gene page and contribute to cross-species
comparisons at AmiGO, the oﬃcial GO query tool
provided by the gene ontology consortium. AO annota-
tions facilitate queries of gene expression data (http://
zﬁn.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatselect.apg).
The AO and GO annotations can also be used for the
robust classiﬁcation of phenotypes, together with a cross-
species structured vocabulary for describing phenotypes.
The phenotypic quality ontology (PATO, http://www.
bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/PATO:Main_Page) is
being developed in collaboration with the model organism
community and the National Center for Biomedical
Ontology (NCBO)(http://www.bioontology.org/).
Phenotype annotations are based on a bipartite syntax
composed of an entity and a quality that may be used to
describe an observable structure or process. The entity, a
GO or AO term, represents the part of the phenotype
being described. The quality, a PATO term, characterizes
how the entity is aﬀected. Examples of PATO qualities are
ectopic, fused, small, edematous and arrested. Special
modiﬁers, or tags, are included in PATO to distinguish
normal from abnormal phenotypes.
We now capture detailed phenotype data from the
scientiﬁc literature as part of our daily curation. Our ﬁrst 7
months of phenotype curation using PATO yielded nearly
5000 annotations from 200 publications. Phenotype

descriptions cataloged at ZFIN in previous years and
ongoing collaborations with laboratories conducting
large-scale mutant screens provided an additional 9600
phenotype annotations for 3000 genotypes.
Phenotypes are tightly integrated into many parts
of ZFIN and can be found on gene, genotype and
anatomy pages. Comparisons of curated phenotypes at
ZFIN are supported through the speciﬁcation of
‘aﬀected anatomy’ on the Mutants/Transgenics query
form (http://zﬁn.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-ﬁshse
lect.apg&line_type=mutant). Phenotype annotations are
associated with individual published ﬁgures and displayed
on phenotype ﬁgure pages (Figure 3). Images
and ﬁgure captions are included when consistent with
journal copyright permissions. Ultimately, the use of
PATO and other ontologies will provide a means for more
complex queries at ZFIN and for comparisons with other
organisms, speciﬁcally for the determination of animal
models of human disease.
We encourage the use of PATO by laboratories
annotating phenotype data and provide tools for this
purpose. Please email us at: zﬁnadmn@zﬁn.org for
additional information.
ZFIN BLAST
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, BLAST, is a powerful
tool for performing comparisons of primary biological
sequence data. ZFIN BLAST (http://zﬁn.org/cgi-bin/
webdriver?MIval=aa-blast.apg) tightly integrates with
the ZFIN database via ZFIN-speciﬁc data sets.
Sequences or sequence accession identiﬁers (IDs) can be
used to identify zebraﬁsh genes annotated with phenotype,
expression or GO data. Available data sets include, but
are not limited to, ZFIN GenBank sequences, ZFIN
cDNA sequences, ZFIN genes with expression, ZFIN
morpholino sequences, ZFIN microRNA sequences and
ZFIN Vega transcripts. ZFIN BLAST displays sequence
Figure 3. A typical published ﬁgure with curated phenotype annotations. ‘Whole organism’, ‘shield’, ‘germ ring’, ‘notochord’ and ‘somite’ are entities
derived from the zebraﬁsh AO. ‘Gastrulation’ and ‘embryonic morphogenesis’ are entities derived from the GO. ‘Increased thickness’, ‘decreased
length’, ‘malformed’, ‘fused with’, ‘arrested’, ‘disrupted’ and ‘abnormal’ are PATO qualities. Links are provided to the genotype page, stage
description, anatomy term pages, GO details page and the full text of the publication. Figure reproduced from Reim and Brand (11).

alignment results with direct links to ZFIN gene and
clone pages. Genes with associated expression, phenotype
and gene ontology data are annotated with E, P and
G icons, respectively. A camera icon indicates that
representative ﬁgures are available at ZFIN.
ZFIN BLAST utilizes the WU-BLAST program (http://
blast.wustl.edu/). Because multiple BLAST searches
can require signiﬁcant system resources, some reasonable
constraints have been implemented to optimize overall
performance. The sequence query length is limited to
50 000 letters. A graphical display is available for the
ﬁrst 50 alignments only. The zebraﬁsh trace archive may
be searched by single queries. Small to medium datasets
accommodate batch queries of up to 100 sequences.
SITE SEARCH
The entire ZFIN site can be searched quickly using the ‘site
search’ feature located at the top right of all ZFIN pages.
A results table narrows the search by categorizingmatching
records by data type. The number of matching pages is
displayed for each category. Links to exact matches are
provided when available. All individual matching records
are listed. This broad view of ZFIN data complements the
more comprehensive data type-speciﬁc query forms.
HELP WITH HANDS-ON RESOURCES
ZFIN plays an important role in the identiﬁcation and
procurement of probes, clones and ﬁsh lines used in
research. Clones, probes and knockdown reagents are
listed on gene pages. Fish lines are found on genotype
pages. Sources and ‘Order this’ links are provided to
resource centers and laboratories that can provide the
resource.
ZFIN works closely with ZIRC to create reciprocal
links between ZFIN data pages and ZIRC inventory
pages. Recent changes to ZFIN’s home page and a new
tab navigation system provide easy access to ZIRC.
ZFIN anatomy pages provide researchers with an
easy means for identifying probes for anatomical struc-
tures. Probes, used in large-scale in situ hybridization
screens (7–9), are ranked by intensity, speciﬁcity and
contrast using a ﬁve-star system.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We will soon expand ZFIN to incorporate detailed
information on antibodies that recognize zebraﬁsh
anatomical structures and gene products. Sequence sup-
port will be enhanced to include transcripts and repeats.
Expression patterns and phenotypes will be associated
with speciﬁc transcripts and transcript annotations.
GBrowse, the generic genome browser provided by
GMOD (10), will provide an interactive view of the
zebraﬁsh genome integrated with ZFIN’s rich biological
data. Expanded use of ontologies will accommodate more
robust queries of ZFIN data.
IMPLEMENTATION
ZFIN is currently implemented with the IBM/Informix
relational database management software. Web-based
HTML forms combined with Java/JSP, JavaScript, Perl
and CGI scripts provide access to the database. A detailed
description of the current ZFIN data model can be found
at http://zﬁn.org/DataModel.
