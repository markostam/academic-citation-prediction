ABSTRACT
We show that nucleic acid structures may be conveni-
ently and inexpensively characterized by their UV
thermal difference spectra. A thermal difference spec-
trum (TDS) is obtained for a nucleic acid by simply
recording the ultraviolet absorbance spectra of
the unfolded and folded states at temperatures
above and below its melting temperature (Tm). The
difference between these two spectra is the TDS.
The TDS has a specific shape that is unique for
each type of nucleic acid structure, a conclusion that
is based on a comparison of .900 spectra from 200
different sequences. The shape of the TDS reflects
the subtleties of base stacking interactions that
occur uniquely within each type of nucleic acid struc-
ture. TDS provides a simple, inexpensive and rapid
method to obtain structural insight into nucleic acid
structures, which is applicable to both DNA and RNA
from short oligomers to polynucleotides. TDS com-
plements circular dichroism as a tool for the structural
characterization of nucleic acids in solution.
INTRODUCTION
DNA and RNA may adopt a number of unusual conforma-
tions. Several laboratories have shown the existence and func-
tional importance of nucleic acid structures that are
fundamentally different from the classical, canonical
B-form duplex. A few years ago, Alexander Rich wrote:
‘DNA comes in many forms’ (1). This is true at all levels
of structure. Different base pairs can form (G.G, A.A, etc.)
and the helicity and/or orientation of the strands can be altered
such as in Z-DNA (2), parallel-stranded (3) and Hoogsteen
duplexes. One can also observe nucleic acid structures com-
posed of more than two strands such as triple- (4,5) and
quadruple- (6–12) helices. All these structures rely upon the
formation of specific base-association schemes (base pairs,
triplets or quartets) (1). The stability of these various con-
formational forms can be measured by a thermal denaturation
experiment. Heating a structured nucleic acid leads to changes
in its ultraviolet absorbance, which reflect the conformational
change of the molecule in solution, specifically a disruption of
base-stacking interactions. Such melting experiments can be
analyzed to determine the thermodynamic basis of DNA or
RNA structure stability. In most cases, one may perform ther-
mal denaturation experiments by recording absorbance at
260 nm as a function of temperature. However, it may also
be preferable to record absorbance at other wavelengths. For
example, quadruplex denaturation does not lead to large vari-
ation in absorbance at 260 nm. It is, however, possible to
follow this denaturation at other wavelengths such as
295 nm (13). This observation prompted us to determine
the optimal wavelengths for thermal denaturation experiments
for each type structure. In the course of our investigations,
we realized that thermal difference spectra (TDS) provided
a distinctive spectroscopic signature for each nucleic acid
structure. We describe the method and its utility here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Nucleic acids samples
Most oligonucleotides presented here were synthesized by
Eurogentec (Belgium) or Genosys on the 40–1000 nmol
scale and resuspended in 200–500 ml of bi-distilled water.
We checked the purity of most samples by mass spectrometry,
HPLC or gel electrophoresis. Polynucleotide samples were
purchased from Amersham-Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ) and
were used without further purification.

Determination of extinction coefficients
Concentration of all oligodeoxynucleotides were estimated by
UV absorption using published sequence-dependent extinction
coefficients (14). In selected cases, molar extinction coeffi-
cients were determined by a colorimetric phosphate analysis
(15). One should not underestimate the difficulty in obtaining
reliable extinction coefficients for all oligonucleotides. For
example, we measured for the human telomeric repeat
sequence 50-AGGG(TTAG3)3, a molar extinction coefficient
of 196 479 ± 5675 M1 cm1 by a colorimetric phosphate
assay. Using two commonly used algorithms, values for the
molar extinction coefficient of 251 800 and 228 500 M1 cm1
were calculated. The calculated values differ by 16–28% from
the more accurate analytically determined value.
Absorbance spectra
All experiments presented here were performed on either
Kontron Uvikons 940/943 or a Cary 3E UV/Vis spectropho-
tometer using quartz cuvettes with an optical pathlength of
0.2–1 cm (16). Absorbance spectra were recorded in the
220–335 nm range, with a scan speed of 200–1000 nm/min,
with a data interval of 1 nm. In most cases, using cuvettes of
0.05–1 cm pathlength, maximum absorbance of the sample
was 0.5–2.0.
Choice of the upper and lower temperatures
A melting curve is usually measured first to learn the width of
the transition. The difference in spectra weakly depends on the
difference in temperature. Using the narrowest possible tem-
perature range is, in principle, recommended. However, one
can still have an excellent superposition for most structures if
one compares various temperature windows [see Supplement-
ary Figure S1 which presents the TDS (raw data or normal-
ized] for an i-DNA sample, using a number of different
temperatures. Clearly, once the curves are normalized, the
shapes are almost superimposable (Supplementary Figure
S1B), demonstrating that the choice of the exact temperatures
does not play a great role.
Experimental constraints
Reproducibility of the TDS is excellent even if spectra are
recorded in a relatively crude way. There is no need for
very slow scans and 1 pt/nm is enough for most applications.
Any high-quality single- or double-beam spectrophotometer
may be used, provided that its performance and stability over
time in the far-UV region (and at high temperature) is checked.
Either a Peltier thermoelectric temperature controller or a
circulating water bath may be used, as long as a wide tem-
perature range can be used. Appropriate precautions should be
taken below room temperature to avoid condensation, and at
high temperature to avoid evaporation and air bubbles. Thor-
ough degassing of solutions helps to minimize bubble forma-
tion at high temperatures. Layering of solutions with mineral
oil and tightly stoppering cuvettes help to minimize evapora-
tion. Condensation at low temperatures can be minimized by
blowing a stream of dry air on the outer cuvette surfaces. It is,
of course, essential to choose a buffer that does not absorb light
in the far-UV region. Cacodylate (pKa: 6.14 at 25C) and
acetate (pKa: 4.62) were preferred over phosphate or Tris
buffer for experiments performed at neutral or slightly acidic
pH. Their pKa is almost temperature independent.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
An example of the determination of a TDS is shown in
Figure 1. The structure in this determination is the antiparallel
‘basket’ G-quadruplex form observed in Na+ solution for the
human telomere repeat sequence 50-AGGG(TTAGGG)3 (17).
Figure 1A shows the circular dichroic spectra of the quad-
ruplex. Figure 1B shows UV absorbance spectra at temperat-
ures well above (90C) and below (20C) the melting
temperature (56C). Figure 1C shows the TDS obtained by
subtracting the low temperature spectrum from the high
temperature spectrum. In this case, the TDS is displayed as
the difference between molar extinction coefficients
between the unfolded and folded forms. Other methods for
displaying the TDS that are convenient and informative are
described below.

Examples of TDS for nine different structure types are
shown in Figure 2. The curves are simply the result of the
arithmetic difference between high and low temperature
absorbance spectra (example shown in Figure 1B). For
most experiments, high temperature was chosen >80C, low
temperature 20C or below. These difference spectra were
then normalized in order to facilitate the comparison of the
spectral shapes, simply by dividing the raw data by its max-
imum value, so that the highest positive peak gets a Y-value of
+1. This normalization, which unfortunately leads to a loss of
information, gives in our hands the most reproducible results.
In principle, molar extinction differences should also be
interesting. However, our opinion is that, unless analytically
determined extinction coefficients are available for all
oligonucleotides (see Materials and Methods section), it is
preferable and more reliable to use the normalization proced-
ure. Analysis of the normalized TDS offers another advantage,
as it allows to deal with partial transitions when (i) the Tm is
too low or too high (no spectra of the pure folded/unfolded
species) (ii) two transitions are overlapping. One may also
analyze the shape of the ‘beginning’ of a transition (i.e. the
part corresponding to partial dissociation at low temperature,
below Tm) and compare it with the global shape or the ‘end’
(see Supplementary Figure S1 for an example).
The resulting normalized TDS are concentration independ-
ent (data not shown). Except for pyrimidine triplexes
(Figure 2H) and to a lesser extent G-quadruplexes
(Figure 2I), one cannot but notice that all spectra within a

structural family are strikingly similar (e.g. Figure 2A, B
and G). Sometimes spectra are essentially identical (Figure
D and E). Comparison of these different structures reveals
reproducible differences in TDS shapes, allowing an invest-
igator to determine the structural type by the spectrum alone.
The robustness of this method was analyzed by several
control experiments (see Figure 3). A simple DNA self-
complementary duplex (50-d-AAATTTAATTAAATTT) was
chosen; its differential absorbance spectra was determined at
various pH (5.5–7.5), salt concentration, in the presence or
absence of magnesium and with different monocations
(sodium, lithium or potassium). All spectra were nearly super-
imposable, despite the fact that the Tm of the duplex may
depend on these conditions: as long as the melting transition
occurs in the temperature interval defined by the low and high-
temperature spectra, very reproducible differences were found
(Figure 3A). Similar observations were found for most struc-
tures, with a few notable exceptions. For G-quadruplexes, this
profile was independent on pH, magnesium, ionic strength, but
not on the nature of the monocation [different quadruplex
conformations may be observed in Na+ and K+ (12,17–19)].
A systematic difference was found between the spectra recor-
ded in sodium and in potassium (Figure 3B). For i-DNA, the
spectra appear to be different when working below pH 6: at
this pH, a significant proportion of cytosines are protonated in
the unfolded form, and C+ has a different absorbance from
unprotonated C [data not shown and (20)].
The first obvious application of this analysis is to help in the
choice of appropriate wavelength(s) for a thermal denaturation
experiment for more detailed thermodynamic studies. These
results have been collected in Table 1. It should be noted that
the relation between a differential peak and a ‘good’ wave-
length is not always direct. In some cases, the observed hypo-
chromicity does not result from the melting of a structure, but
is the consequence of temperature-dependent extinction coef-
ficient of the folded and/or the unfolded forms. For example,
the positive peak at 273 nm observed in most quadruplexes
(Figure 2I) results from a significant temperature-dependent
increase of absorbance of the single strands. This is related to
the classical problem of the sloping baseline analysis of
melting profiles: all species exhibit temperature-dependent

the other peaks, their relative value is provided. (+) and () indicate
positive and negative peaks, respectively. A negative peak indicates
that upon melting a cooperative decrease in absorbance should be

aValid for B-DNA; A-DNA exhibits a different absorbance spectra, as shown by
Jose and Po¨rschke (36). 0, 50 or 100% GC refers to the relative amounts of GC
and AT base pairs. The exact position of the positive peak depends on sequence:
alternating AT motifs have a maximumat258 nm, whereasAn.Tn blocks leada
maximum at 262 nm (see Figure 2A).
bIn agreement with Ramsing and Jovin (27).
cAlso see Pohl and Jovin (37).
dThis negative peak at 295 nm is the result of partial cytosine deprotonation
upon unfolding (20).
eThis is the only structure for which an annulation of the differential spectra is
observed in this region (see Figure 2E).
fValid for triplexes involving mixed TAT and CGC+ triplets. This spectra
corresponds to a triplex-to-duplex conversion. For RNA polynucleotide tri-
plexes solely involving U.A*U triplets, see (25). Poly dA. 2 poly dT gives a
TDS close to dA18 2dT18 (Figure 2H).

hThe exact position and relative contribution of the peaks depend on the natureof
the cation. The positive peak at 273 nm is attributed in large part to the
variation in absorbance of the single-strand; the depth of the valley between
the 243 and 273 nm peaks is strongly sequence dependent (see the thrombin
aptamer, GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG for an atypical spectrum). The negative
value at 295 nm may vary significantly. Also see (18,21) for the signature of
other quadruplexes.

absorbance properties. One would then argue that the most
convenient differential spectra should be isothermal; however,
this requires the ability to record the absorbance of the folded
and the unfolded states at the same temperature. This is pos-
sible in only a limited number of cases (21), when association
and dissociation of the structure are very slow. Otherwise,
T-jump or fast mixing experiments are required. Despite
this limitation, this simple dual-temperature measurement is
sufficient for most determinations.
These spectra provide information complementary to circu-
lar dichroism. The UV absorbance of nucleic acids from 200 to
300 nm is exclusively due to transitions of the planar purine
and pyrimidine bases. The phosphate backbone begins to
contribute at190 nm. The CD spectrum is probing the asym-
metry of bases. At wavelengths >200 nm, the asymmetry
arises from CD induced into the bases as a result of stacking
interactions and coupling with backbone transitions. Hypo-
chromicity is mainly the result of base stacking (22). There-
fore, one can expect that the relative positioning of the bases
will play a crucial role in this differential spectra. The theory
of hypochromicity is complex, the changes in light absorption
occurring upon denaturation is attributed to the interaction
between the dipoles induced in the chromophore by the
light (22). It is striking that a number of very different struc-
tures involve a negative differential absorbance at 295 nm
(Table 1). This might be the result of the significant contribu-
tion of n! p* transition moments at this wavelength: as these
transition moments are parallel to the helix axis (23), increased
stacking resulting from the formation of a folded structure may
result in hyperchromism. However, the absorbance spectra of
nucleic acid bases are deceptively simple: they actually cor-
respond to a number of different p ! p* and n ! p* trans-
itions. Hypochromism at a given wavelength will not only
depend on the intrinsic transition moments of each base,
but also on the relative moment of the interacting bases
(base-paired or stacked). Such complexity will make an
accurate calculation of predicted differential absorbances a
difficult task.
Although the dissociation of all G-quadruplexes analyzed so
far show an inverted transition at 295 nm (13), this property is
not unambiguously indicative of G-quadruplexes. Z-DNA
(Figure 2C) i-motif (Figure 2G) Hoogsteen duplexes
(Figure 2F) and pyrimidine triplex (Figure 2H) formation
also leads to an inverted transition at 295 nm. In
Figure 2F–H, this is the result of the differences in absorbance
between C and C+ (20). A simple comparison of these spectra
indicates that the global shape rather than the wavelength of
the peak is specific for each structure (Figure 2).
These observations suggest that the simple recording of two
absorbance spectra might be sufficient to obtain qualitative
structural information on the identity of the folded form.
This was a common accepted practice in the sixties, when
the melting of polynucleotides [or guanylic acid (6)] was
analyzed [see for example (24–26)]. Unfortunately, with a
few notable exceptions (27–32), complete spectra are rarely
presented in contemporary reports. We demonstrate here that
in many cases this difference is very informative. Of course,
this requires that the high and low temperatures correspond to
the unfolded and folded forms, respectively. In other words,
the Tm of the structure must lie between these two values.
Although the spectra of different nucleic acids that fold
into the same type of structure are not identical, significant
homology was found between the spectra. The uniqueness of
these spectra is sufficient, in most cases, to suggest a type of
folding. However, we could not confidently distinguish the
differential spectra of a purine-rich triplex (the so-called
GA or GT motif) from the melting of a duplex (data not
shown). This is in agreement with the conclusions that the
formation of these triplexes occurs without significant hypo-
chromicity (33). Similarly, no significant difference was found
between a mismatched and a fully complementary DNA
duplex (data not shown).
We have now collected >900 spectra, corresponding to
>200 different nucleic acid sequences (mostly DNA), each
tested 2–26 times under different experimental conditions.
This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to systematically
collect thermal difference spectra as initially proposed 40 years
ago by Fresco et al (34). Our goal is to first build an open
access database of the spectra of nucleic acids and to propose a
predictive algorithm that provides a probability function of a
given structure. This should be helpful in the discovery of new
nucleic acid folding schemes, and in the crude determination
of the global folding of an oligonucleotide (which, for
example, might have been found by SELEX). We are now
applying this method to the analysis of trinucleotide repeats
(35) and to samples which may adopt complex conformations,
involving more than one simple structure. Efforts are also
being made on RNA structures (and corresponding DNA
strands carrying deoxyuracyl bases): RNA duplex and quad-
ruplex structures exhibit related but distinct signatures from
the corresponding DNA duplexes (data not shown) and quad-
ruplexes (18,21), respectively. We also wish to analyze the
signature of modified bases (such as 5-methyl cytosines) and
the impact of modifying the sugar/phosphate backbone (such
as 20-O-methyl phosphorothioates, LNA or PNA).
