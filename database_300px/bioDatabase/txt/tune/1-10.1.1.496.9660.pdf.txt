ABSTRACT
DNA polymerases achieve high-fidelity DNA replica-
tion in part by checking the accuracy of each
nucleotide that is incorporated and, if a mistake is
made, the incorrect nucleotide is removed before
further primer extension takes place. In order to
proofread, the primer-end must be separated from
the template strand and transferred from the poly-
merase to the exonuclease active center where the
excision reaction takes place; then the trimmed
primer-end is returned to the polymerase active
center. Thus, proofreading requires polymerase-
to-exonuclease and exonuclease-to-polymerase
active site switching. We have used a fluorescence
assay that uses differences in the fluorescence
intensity of 2-aminopurine (2AP) to measure the
rates of active site switching for the bacteriophage
T4 DNA polymerase. There are three findings: (i) the
rate of return of the trimmed primer-end from the
exonuclease to the polymerase active center is
rapid,`500 s21; (ii) T4 DNA polymerase can remove
two incorrect nucleotides under single turnover
conditions, which includes presumed exonuclease-
to-polymerase and polymerase-to-exonuclease
active site switching steps and (iii) proofreading
reactions that initiate in the polymerase active
center are not intrinsically processive.
INTRODUCTION
DNA polymerase proofreading removes misincorporated
nucleotides at the primer-end (1,2), which signiﬁcantly
improves the ﬁdelity of DNA replication (3). Since
increased epithelial tumors are observed in mice that
express an exonuclease-deﬁcient DNA polymerase d,
DNA polymerase proofreading is important in preventing
mutations that lead to cancer (4). DNA polymerase
proofreading was ﬁrst demonstrated to be a major
determinant of replication ﬁdelity for the bacteriophage
T4 DNA polymerase (2,5,6) and this DNA polymerase
continues to be a valuable model for studies of proof-
reading, especially for Family B DNA polymerases, which
include the eukaryotic DNA polymerases d and e and
several viral DNA polymerases (7,8).
The T4 DNA polymerase proofreading pathway has at
least four steps (9,10). During chromosome replication, the
proofreading pathway is initiated in the polymerase active
center when an incorrect nucleotide is inserted (step 1),
which hinders further primer elongation (2,3,11,12).
The end of the primer strand is then separated from the
template and transferred to the exonuclease active center
(step 2), which requires a b hairpin structure in the
exonuclease domain to form stable exonuclease complexes
(13–15). The terminal nucleotide is cleaved from the
primer-end in the exonuclease active center (step 3) and
then the trimmed primer-end is returned to the polymerase
active center where nucleotide incorporation can resume
(step 4). Genetic studies indicate that four of the ﬁve
protein domains of the T4 DNA polymerase are involved
in the proofreading pathway (16). The genetic studies are
corroborated by structural studies, which ﬁnd signiﬁcant
conformational diﬀerences for the exonuclease, palm and
thumb domains in polymerase complexes compared to
exonuclease complexes (15,17–20).
There are still unanswered questions about how the
primer-end is shuttled back-and-forth between the poly-
merase and exonuclease active centers, which we address
here. Many DNA polymerases are normally tethered to
the DNA by a protein ‘clamp’, which is necessary for
processive DNA replication. The phage T4 clamp, the
product of gene 45, is also reported to stimulate proof-
reading (21,22), but is the clamp essential for processive
transfer of the primer-end from the polymerase to the
exonuclease active center and for transfer of the trimmed
primer-end from the exonuclease back to the polymerase
active center?
We proposed that the clamp is essential for processive
proofreading that initiates in the polymerase active center
because greater intrinsic processivity in nucleotide incor-
poration is observed for mutant DNA polymerases that
have reduced ability to initiate the proofreading pathway,
while reduced processivity in primer extension is detected
for mutant DNA polymerases that proofread more (23).

Intrinsic proofreading, however, is observed for the T4
DNA polymerase and the closely related RB69 DNA
polymerase without its clamp (12,15). Coupled removal of
an incorrect nucleotide and primer extension were
observed under single turnover conditions in the presence
of a heparin trap; however, it is not clear in these
experiments if the T4 DNA polymerase ﬁrst bound the
DNA substrate in the polymerase or the exonuclease
active center. If the T4 DNA polymerase bound the
mismatched DNA initially in the polymerase active center,
then the entire proofreading pathway beginning from
strand separation and transfer of the primer-end from the
polymerase to the exonuclease active center can be carried
out without enzyme dissociation. However, if the T4 DNA
polymerase can form exonuclease complexes directly
without ﬁrst forming polymerase complexes, then just
the steps of hydrolysis and transfer of the trimmed primer-
end from the exonuclease to the polymerase active center
have been demonstrated to be processive in the absence of
the clamp.
Another outstanding question is the rate of active site
switching. Proofreading during ongoing DNA replication
is restricted primarily to incorrect nucleotides at the
primer-end because the rate of primer extension for a
matched primer terminus is much greater than the rate for
initiation of the proofreading pathway, but replicative
DNA polymerases have poor ability to extend a mis-
matched primer terminus, which then tips the balance in
favor of proofreading (3,9,11). Thus, there is a kinetic
barrier to initiation of the proofreading pathway, which
suggests that the rate of polymerase-to-exonuclease active
site switching will be relatively slow. In contrast, transfer
of the trimmed primer-end from the exonuclease to
polymerase active center could be rapid if the corrected
primer-end returns to the polymerase active center
unassisted (15).
We have developed a ﬂuorescence assay using the
ﬂuorescent adenine base analog 2-aminopurine (2AP) to
examine shuttling of the primer-end between the poly-
merase and exonuclease active centers during the proof-
reading reaction catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase.
This assay depends on two observations: (i) T4 DNA
polymerase recognizes a terminal 2AP-T base pair as a
mismatch and preferentially proofreads the mismatch
before primer extension (24), which we conﬁrm in
experiments reported here and (ii) T4 DNA polymerase
forms distinct ﬂuorescent complexes with diﬀerent levels
of ﬂuorescence intensity depending if 2AP is in the n or
+1 position in the template strand (25–29). Moderately,
ﬂuorescent exonuclease complexes are formed preferen-
tially with 2AP in the n position of the template strand
(Figure 1A) and highly ﬂuorescent complexes are formed
with DNA labeled at the +1 position (Figure 1B) in which
the primer-end is bound in the polymerase active center.
Thus, exonucleolytic proofreading of DNA in which 2AP
is initially in the n position will produce an increase in
ﬂuorescence intensity as the moderately ﬂuorescent
exonuclease complexes are converted to the highly
ﬂuorescent complexes with 2AP in the +1 position.
Since the primer-end is initially in the exonuclease active
center and is then transferred to the polymerase active
center after the terminal nucleotide is removed to form the
highly ﬂuorescent +1 complexes, the rate of increase in
2AP ﬂuorescence intensity provides information on the
rate of exonuclease-to-polymerase active site switching.
We performed this experiment with wild-type and
exonuclease-deﬁcient T4 DNA polymerases under pre-
steady-state, single-turnover conditions in which heparin
was used to trap any free T4 DNA polymerase (12). An
increase in ﬂuorescence intensity was observed for the
wild-type T4 DNA polymerase at the rate of 145 3 s1,
but not for an exonuclease-deﬁcient T4 DNA polymerase.
These results are discussed with respect to the overall
proofreading reaction, active site switching, structural
implications and replication ﬁdelity of the wild-type and
proofreading defective T4 DNA polymerases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA polymerases
Expression, puriﬁcation and characterization of the wild-
type and mutant D112A/E114A- and W213S-DNA
polymerases were done as described previously (30,31).
DNA substrates
The 2AP-containing DNA substrates are described in
Figure 1. The substrates were prepared as described
previously (13,14,25). The 30 terminus of the template
strand of the DNA duplexes was protected from enzyme
binding by attachment of a biotin (b) group (BiotinTEG-
CPG, Glen Research). The 2AP phosphoramidite was
purchased from Glen Research. All oligonucleotides were
puriﬁed by gel electrophoresis. The primer and template
strands were annealed in buﬀer containing HEPES
(pH 7.5) and 50mM NaCl with a 20% excess of the
oligonucleotide without 2AP to ensure complete hybridi-
zation of the 2AP containing strand.
The non-2AP containing DNA substrates used for
Figure 2 were synthesized using standard procedures and
puriﬁed by gel electrophoresis. The annealing conditions
were the same as used for the 2AP-containing oligonu-
cleotides. The template strand was in 20% excess to ensure
Figure 1. DNA substrates with the base analog 2-aminopurine (P).

complete hybridization of the 32P-labeled primer strand,
which was labeled using a standard T4 polynucleotide
kinase labeling procedure (12).
Processive (single-turnover) proofreading and incorporation
reactions with 32P-labeled DNA substrates
Reaction mixtures (20ml) contained 50 nM DNA, 150 nM
DNA polymerase, 25mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50mM NaCl,
1mM DTT, 0.5mM EDTA and 100 mM dNTPs as
indicated. The reactions were ﬁrst pre-incubated at
378C and then started by the addition of a solution of
Mg2+/heparin to give a ﬁnal concentration of 8mM
Mg2+ and 1 or 0.1mg/ml heparin as indicated (Sigma,
3000 average molecular weight from porcine intestinal
mucosa). Reactions were stopped after 15 s by addition of
20 ml gel loading solution (95% formamide, 20mM
EDTA, and xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue dyes).
Reddy et al. (12) used heparin at 1mg/ml, but we ﬁnd that
0.1mg/ml is suﬃcient (10). The reaction products were
separated on DNA sequencing type gels containing
15% acrylamide and 8M urea. The 32P-labeled products
were visualized by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular
Dynamics, Inc.).
Exonuclease and primer extension reactions with 32P-labeled
DNA substrates under non-processive (multiple-turnover)
conditions
The same reaction conditions were used as described
above for single-turnover reactions except that the heparin
trap was omitted.
Processive (single-turnover) hydrolysis and active
site switching reactions determined by using changes
in 2AP fluorescence intensity
Stopped-ﬂow experiments were performed with the
Applied Photophysics SX.18 MV instrument, which
allowed us to determine the pre-steady-state kinetics of
selected aspects of the proofreading pathway. Excitation
was at 310 nm; a 320 nm cutoﬀ ﬁlter was used. The
temperature in the sample-handling unit was maintained
at 20.0 0.58C. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal
volumes of a solution of T4 DNA polymerase–DNA
complexes, which contained 400 nM DNA labeled at the
n position with 2AP (Figure 1A), 1000 nM T4 DNA
polymerase, 25mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50mM NaCl, 1mM
DTT and 0.5mM EDTA with a second solution contain-
ing 16mMMgCl2, 0.2mg/ml heparin, 25mMHEPES (pH
7.5), 50mM NaCl and 1mM DTT. After mixing, the ﬁnal
concentrations of reaction components were 200 nM
DNA polymerase–DNA complexes, 25mM HEPES (pH
7.5), 50mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 0.25mM EDTA, 8mM
MgCl2 and 0.1mg/ml heparin. The optimal DNA and
enzyme concentrations to ensure full complex formation
were determined by titration experiments (25). In general,
a52-fold excess of DNA polymerase over DNA produces
maximal complex formation for DNA concentrations
from 200 to 600 nM. Curves were ﬁt either to single
(monophasic) or double (biphasic) exponential equations.
Six or more runs were performed with each set of reaction
conditions; mean values were calculated.

extension with the matched DNA (lane 1) and processive proofreading
and primer extension reactions with the mismatched DNA (lane 2). The
W213S-DNA polymerase had less ability to fully extend the matched
DNA (lane 3) and almost no ability to carry out processive
proofreading and primer extension reactions with the mismatched
DNA (lane 4). The D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase extended the
matched DNA substrate as eﬃciently as the wild-type enzyme (lane 5),
but this mutant DNA polymerase had no ability to extend the
mismatched DNA substrate. A control reaction with no DNA
polymerase is in lane 7.

Multiple turnover proofreading reactions determined by
using changes in 2AP fluorescence intensity
The same reaction conditions were used as described
above for single-turnover reactions except that the heparin
trap was omitted.
RESULTS
Processive (single-turnover) proofreading and incorporation
reactions with 32P-labeled DNA substrates
Reddy et al. (12) used heparin to obtain single-turnover
(single-encounter) conditions for exonuclease and nucleo-
tide incorporation reactions with the T4 DNA polymer-
ase; any DNA polymerase molecules that dissociate from
the DNA template were prevented from rebinding to
the DNA substrate by forming stable complexes with
heparin. Heparin is indeed a useful ‘trap’ for the T4 DNA
polymerase. If 1mg/ml heparin, the concentration used by
Reddy et al. (12), is added to exonuclease or primer-
extension reactions with the matched DNA substrate
(Figure 2A) before the addition of the T4 DNA
polymerase, no activity is detected (Figure 2B, lanes 1
and 3). In the absence of heparin, exonucleolytic degra-
dation (Figure 2B, lane 2) and full primer extension
(Figure 2B, lane 4) are observed.
Single-turnover primer extension reactions with
matched and mismatched DNA substrates (Figure 2A)
were carried out with the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase.
Reaction components were ﬁrst pre-incubated in the
absence of Mg2+ and then the reactions were initiated
by the addition of a solution of Mg2+/heparin. In the
primer extension reaction with the matched DNA
substrate in which the only nucleotide provided was
dCTP, the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase fully extended
most of the primer by two nucleotides; only a small
amount of partially extended +1 product was detected
(Figure 2C, lane 1). Although the wild-type T4 DNA
polymerase has a potent exonuclease activity, only traces
of products less than the length of the primer strand were
observed (Figure 2C, lane 1). Degradation products were
detected because the only nucleotide provided in these
reactions was dCTP, which means that if there was any
primer degradation—ﬁrst removal of the terminal dTMP,
then another dTMP, etc. (Figure 1A) the primer could not
be resynthesized. Thus, the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase
formed primarily polymerase complexes with the matched
DNA substrate that were poised for nucleotide incorpora-
tion rather than exonuclease complexes poised for primer
degradation.
Primer extension was also detected with the mismatched
T-T DNA substrate (Figure 2A) in which dCTP and
dATP were provided (Figure 2C, lane 2). Because the
wild-type T4 DNA polymerase cannot eﬃciently extend a
mismatched primer-end (2,11,12), the primer extension
observed with the mismatched DNA substrate must have
been preceded by removal of the incorrect terminal
dTMP, which was followed by transfer of the trimmed
primer-end from the exonuclease to the polymerase active
center, incorporation of dAMP and then incorporation of
two dCMPs. All steps were performed without dissocia-
tion of the DNA polymerase since the heparin trap was
present.
To further demonstrate that exonucleolytic proofread-
ing of the mismatched primer terminus is required before
the primer can be extended, experiments were repeated
with the exonuclease deﬁcient D112A/E114A-DNA poly-
merase under the same conditions used for the wild-type
T4 DNA polymerase. The D112A/E114A-DNA polymer-
ase has an alanine substitution for an essential aspartate
(D112) residue in the exonuclease active center and, as a
consequence, has almost no detectable 30 ! 50 exonuclease
activity (31). While the D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase
extended the matched DNA substrate under single-
turnover conditions (Figure 2C, lane 5) as eﬃciently as
the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase (Figure 2C, lane 1), no
extension was observed for the mismatched DNA
substrate (Figure 2C, lane 6).
We also tested the ability of the W213S-DNA
polymerase to carry out primer extension reactions of
the matched and mismatched DNA substrates under
single-turnover conditions. The W213S-DNA polymerase
replicates DNA with reduced ﬁdelity in vivo (16), which is
due to reduced exonuclease activity. Signiﬁcantly less
degradation of single-stranded DNA was observed for the
W213S-DNA polymerase compared to the wild-type T4
DNA polymerase in multiple-turnover reactions (Figure 3;
compare wild-type activity in lanes 1 and 2 to that of the
W213S-DNA polymerase in lanes 3 and 4). Even less
exonuclease activity was detected for the W213S-DNA
polymerase on double-stranded DNA (compare wild-type
activity in lane 5 to that of the W213S-DNA polymerase
in lane 8). In single-turnover reactions with the W213S-
DNA polymerase and the matched DNA substrate,
dCMP incorporation was observed (Figure 2C, lane 3),
but primer extension was not as eﬃcient as observed for
the wild-type and D112A/E114A-DNA polymerases
(Figure 2C, lanes 1 and 5, respectively). In single-turnover
reactions with the W213S-DNA polymerase and the
mismatched DNA substrate (Figure 2C, lane 4), a small
amount of +2 extension product was detected, which
indicates that the W213S-DNA polymerase can catalyze
only a very limited processive proofreading-nucleotide
incorporation reaction.
T4DNA polymerase recognizes the terminal 2AP-T
base pair as a mismatch
The DNA substrate labeled with 2AP in the n (terminal)
position of the primer strand (Figure 1C) was labeled with
32P at the 50-end of the primer strand. Single-turnover
experiments were performed as were done for the
reactions shown in Figure 2C except that the concentra-
tion of heparin was reduced from 1 to 0.1mg/ml, which we
found to be as eﬀective (10). Reactions contained dTTP,
dCTP and dATP; thus, successful primer extension will
extend the primer by 4 nt. The wild-type T4 DNA
polymerase produced the +4 extension product under
single turnover conditions with the heparin trap (Figure 4,
lane 2), but much less primer extension was observed
for the W213S-DNA polymerase (Figure 4, lane 1).

No primer extension product was detected for the D112A/
E114A-DNA polymerase (data not shown), which indi-
cates that extension of the 2AP-T terminal base pair
cannot be done under single turnover conditions by this
mutant enzyme. Thus, the processive primer extension
reaction ﬁrst required removal of the terminal 2AP
nucleotide from the primer-end, then transfer of the
trimmed primer-end to the polymerase active center and
ﬁnally nucleotide incorporation.
The reactions shown in Figure 4 demonstrate that the
terminal 2AP-T base pair with 2AP in the terminal
position of the primer strand is recognized as a mismatch
by the T4 DNA polymerase. The same is true if 2AP is in
the n position in the template strand and T is in the
terminal position of the primer strand (25,28). The DNA
substrate labeled with 2AP in the n position of the
template strand (Figure 1A) is used in the next
experiments.
Determining therateof theproofreadingreactioncatalyzedby
the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase using changes in 2AP
fluorescence intensity; single turnover conditions
The previous experiments demonstrate that the T4 DNA
polymerase can proofread a T-T mismatch (Figure 2C)
and a 2AP-T terminal base pair (Figure 4) and then
incorporate nucleotides without dissociating from the
DNA substrate; however, it is not possible to determine
from these experiments if the proofreading pathway
initiated in the polymerase or the exonuclease active
center or in both. These experiments also do not provide
information about the rate of active site switching. Both
questions were addressed by measuring the increase in
2AP ﬂuorescence intensity in stopped-ﬂow experiments
for the conversion of the DNA substrate with 2AP in the
n position in the template strand to the DNA with 2AP in
the +1 position (the DNAs are described in Figure 1A
and B, respectively).
Two rates were detected for removal of the 2AP
nucleotide from the primer-end under multiple turnover
conditions for DNA substrates like the DNA described in
Figure 3. The W213S-DNA polymerase has reduced exonuclease
activity. All reactions were incubated for 15 s at 378C. Reactions with
25 nM single-stranded DNA and 25 nM or 50 nM enzyme are shown in
lanes 1 and 3 and lanes 2 and 4, respectively. Exonuclease reactions
with the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase are in lanes 1 and 2; reactions
with the W213S-DNA polymerase are in lanes 3 and 4. Exonuclease
reactions with 25 nM double-stranded DNA and 50 nM enzyme are in
lanes 5 (wild-type) and 8 (W213S-DNA polymerase). Primer extension
reactions with the wild-type and W213S-DNA polymerases are in lanes
6 and 7, respectively.
Figure 4. Proofreading of the 2AP-T terminal base pair occurs before
primer extension; single turnover conditions. Primer extension reactions
were performed with the DNA substrate described in Figure 1C, which
has 2AP at the primer terminus. Reactions contained DNA labeled at
the 50-end of the primer strand with 32P, DNA polymerase, buﬀer,
dATP, dTTP and dCTP; reactions were initiated with a solution of
Mg2+/heparin as described in Materials and Methods section. Full
primer extension was observed for the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase
(lane 2), but not for the exonuclease-deﬁcient W213S-DNA polymerase
(lane 1). A control reaction with no enzyme is shown in lane 3.

Figure 1C (13,14,32); thus, two rates are also expected for
the removal of dTMP opposite template 2AP for the DNA
substrate described in Figure 1A. The two rates observed
in previous experiments were explained by the proposal
that the DNA primer/template exists in two states in
solution: (i) an annealed state, which is the substrate used
by the T4 DNA polymerase for forming complexes with
the primer/template bound in the polymerase active center
and (ii) a melted state, which is the preferred substrate for
forming exonuclease complexes in which the end of the
primer strand is bound in the exonuclease active center
(32). The faster of the two rates was attributed to
proofreading reactions that initiated in the exonuclease
active center (activated complexes) and the slower rate was
attributed to reactions in which the template/primer was
ﬁrst bound in the polymerase active center and, thus, were
initially inactive for the hydrolysis reaction. If two rates
are detected in the presence of the heparin trap for
removal of dTMP opposite template 2AP, then complexes
formed initially with the primer/template in the polymer-
ase active center and complexes formed with the primer-
end bound in the exonuclease active center can both
support processive proofreading reactions. If a single rate
is observed, then only one type of complex can carry out
the proofreading reaction processively. For reactions
initiating in the exonuclease active center, a rate as fast
as 100 to 4200 s1 may be observed, which are the
reported rates for hydrolysis of the terminal phosphodie-
ster bond in the exonuclease active center (9,13).
A 510-fold slower rate is expected for proofreading
reactions that initiate in the polymerase active center
(9,13,14,32).
A solution of moderately ﬂuorescent complexes was
formed with the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase and
DNA labeled in the n position in the template strand
(Figure 1A). This solution was mixed with an equal volume
of a second solution containing Mg2+/heparin in the
stopped-ﬂow, which produced an increase in ﬂuorescence
intensity at the observed rate, kobs=145 3 s1
(Figure 5A). The curve was best ﬁt by a single exponential
equation. Because a single rate was observed in the range of
the reported hydrolysis rate, processive proofreading
appears to be detected only for complexes in which the
primer-end was bound initially in the exonuclease active
center. Thus, the addition of Mg2+ to the preformed
complexes triggered the following chain of steps: excision
of the terminal phosphodiester bond in the exonuclease
active center to remove dTMP and transfer of the trimmed
primer-end to the polymerase active center to form the
highly ﬂuorescent complexes in which 2AP is now in the
+1 position. In experiments with the 32P-labeled DNAs
(Figures 2C and 4), nucleotide incorporation follows return
of the trimmed primer-end to the polymerase active center.
The highly ﬂuorescent complexes with 2AP in the +1
position are also poised for nucleotide incorporation since
these complexes bind the correct nucleotide rapidly within
the dead time of the stopped-ﬂow instrument (26,29).
No increase in ﬂuorescence intensity was detected in
reactions with the proofreading deﬁcient W213S-DNA
polymerase, as expected since this mutant DNA poly-
merase has only very limited ability to carry out processive
proofreading as demonstrated in the primer extension
assays (Figures 2C and 4).
Determining the rate of the proofreading reactions catalyzed
by thewild-type andW213S-DNApolymerases using changes
in 2AP fluorescence intensity; multiple turnover conditions
The above experiments were repeated without the heparin
trap. The increase in ﬂuorescence intensity was biphasic in
reactions with the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase. The
best curve ﬁt was achieved by using a double exponential
equation; the faster rate was 106 10 s1 and the slower
rate was 11 1 s1 (Figure 5B, Table 1). The two rates
indicate that two distinct populations of complexes were
formed initially: one population (40% of the complexes)
can form the highly ﬂuorescent +1 complexes at about
Figure 5. Time courses for conversion of exonuclease complexes to
polymerase complexes. (A) Single turnover conditions. A solution of
complexes formed with the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase and DNA
labeled at the n position in the template strand with 2AP (Figure 1A)
was mixed with a second solution containing Mg2+/heparin as
described in Materials and Methods section. Fluorescence intensity
increased at the rate of  145 s1. (B) Multiple turnover conditions. The
experimental conditions described above were repeated except that
heparin was omitted. The increase in ﬂuorescence intensity was
biphasic; the best curve ﬁt was achieved using a double exponential
equation. The faster rate was  106 s1 and the slower rate was  11 s1
(Table 1).

the same rate as detected in the presence of the heparin trap
and a second population (60% of the complexes) that
forms the +1 complexes at a 10-fold slower rate (Table 1).
Since a single 145 s1 rate was observed in the presence of
the heparin trap, only the population of complexes that
proofreads at the apparent rate of106 s1 rate appears to
carry out the proofreading reaction processively. Since
heparin prevents detection of the slower 11 s1 rate,
complexes responsible for this rate must initially be inactive
and can convert to active complexes only by an intervening
dissociation, heparin-sensitive step.
A single rate of 1.5 0.1 s1 was observed for the
W213S-DNA polymerase (Table 1). This slow rate is
consistent with the severely reduced ability of this mutant
DNA polymerase to degrade single- and double-stranded
DNA (Figure 3).
Determining the rate for removal of two incorrect nucleotides
The T4 DNA polymerase and the closely related RB69
DNA polymerase can remove two incorrect nucleotides
and then extend the primer terminus under single-turnover
conditions in the presence of the heparin trap (12,15). We
repeated the above experiments with the DNA substrate
illustrated in Figure 1D, which has two incorrect G
nucleotides at the end of the primer strand and 2AP is in
the n position in the template strand. Moderately,
ﬂuorescent exonuclease complexes are formed with this
DNA substrate (25,28). After removal of the two incorrect
G nucleotides, 2AP will be in the +2 position (Figure 1D).
T4 DNA polymerase complexes formed with 2AP in the
+2 position of the template strand are only weakly
ﬂuorescent (25). Thus, removal of the two terminal
incorrect G nucleotides is expected to produce an overall
decrease in ﬂuorescence intensity, but will there be an
intervening increase in ﬂuorescence intensity after removal
of the terminal incorrect nucleotide since 2AP will be
transiently in the +1 position? Highly ﬂuorescent +1
complexes are not expected to be formed after removal of
the ﬁrst incorrect nucleotide since these complexes are not
detected if the terminal base pair is mismatched (28). No
increase in ﬂuorescence intensity was observed; ﬂuores-
cence intensity decreased at the rate of 55 2 s1
(Figure 6, Table 1). The same rate of decrease in
ﬂuorescence intensity was also observed without the
heparin trap, which indicates that none of the complexes
formed during the process of removing two incorrect
nucleotides are sensitive to the heparin trap.
The T4 DNA polymerase exonuclease activity degrades
single-stranded DNA one nucleotide at a time from the
30-end; hence, the rate of 55 s1 for removing two
nucleotides is the combined rate for two consecutive
excision steps. If removal of the penultimate incorrect
nucleotide occurs at the rate of145 s1, as determined for
removal of a single incorrect nucleotide (Figure 5A), then it
is possible to calculate the overall rate for removal of the
terminal incorrect nucleotide by using the following
equation: 1/kremoval of 2 nucleotides=1/kremoval of 1st
nucleotide+1/kremoval of 2nd nucleotide. By rearranging the
equation, 1/kremoval of 1st nucleotide=1/kremoval of 2 nucleotides–
1/kremoval of 2nd nucleotide=1/55–1/145. Thus, kremoval of 1st
nucleotide=88.5 s
1.
The slower apparent rate for removal of the terminal
nucleotide compared to the rate for removal of the second
incorrect nucleotide suggests that there are extra steps for
removal of the terminal nucleotide. We propose that after
removal of the terminal nucleotide, the trimmed primer-
end is returned to the polymerase active center. This
proposal is reasonable since the correctness of the primer-
end can only be examined in the polymerase active center
where hydrogen bonding between the terminal base on the
primer strand and the complementary template base can

be evaluated as well as the geometry of the terminal base
pair (29,33). Such a mechanism must exist in order to
explain how exonucleolytic proofreading is limited pri-
marily to the removal of incorrect nucleotides. If the
primer-end is found to be incorrect, then the primer-end is
returned to the exonuclease active center for a second
cycle of excision, and then the further trimmed primer-end
is returned to the polymerase active center.
DISCUSSION
We developed a ﬂuorescence assay that uses changes in
2AP ﬂuorescence intensity in 2AP-labeled DNA to
monitor the proofreading reaction catalyzed by the T4
DNA polymerase. T4 DNA polymerase forms moderately
ﬂuorescent exonuclease complexes with duplex DNA
substrates labeled with 2AP in the n position of the
template strand (Figure 1A) and highly ﬂuorescent
complexes with the primer-end bound in the polymerase
active center for DNAs labeled at the +1 position in the
template strand (Figure 1B). Thus, exonucleolytic proof-
reading of the DNA substrate labeled initially with 2AP in
the n position in the template strand will produce an
increase in ﬂuorescence intensity due to formation of the
highly ﬂuorescent complexes with 2AP in the +1 position.
The rate of increase in ﬂuorescence intensity is a measure
of the overall reaction; kobs under single turnover
conditions was 145 3 s1 (Figure 5A).
We used this assay to conﬁrm the results of Reddy et al.
(12) that the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase can catalyze a
processive proofreading reaction without accessory pro-
teins, but only for reactions that initiate in the exonuclease
active center. Only a single proofreading rate of 145 s1
was detected in the presence of the heparin trap
(Figure 5A), but two rates of 106 and 11 s1 were
detected in the absence of heparin (Figure 5B). We (32) and
others (9) proposed that the T4 DNA polymerase can form
two types of complexes—[E-D]exo complexes that are active
for hydrolysis of the terminal nucleotide and [E-D]pol
complexes that are inactive for hydrolysis. [E-D]exo
complexes react quickly with Mg2+ to give a burst of
product. Since the 145 and 106 s1 rates are in the range of
the reported hydrolysis rate for the T4 DNA polymerase
(9,13), these rates are likely produced from active [E-D]exo
complexes. Under multiple turnover conditions, inactive
[E-D]pol complexes can convert slowly to active [E-D]exo
complexes, at the rate of 11 s1 in experiments reported
here (Figure 5B, Table 1). This slow rate is not detected in
the presence of the heparin trap, which indicates that
conversion from an inactive to an active state involves
enzyme dissociation. This point is discussed again later
with respect to the clamped or tethered DNA polymerase.
The 2AP ﬂuorescence assay can also be used to
determine the rates for active site switching. The rate of
increase in ﬂuorescence intensity for conversion of the
moderately ﬂuorescent exonuclease complexes with 2AP
in the n position to the highly ﬂuorescent polymerase
complexes with 2AP in the +1 position is a measure of the
overall rate for the proofreading pathway that initiates in
the exonuclease active center. The terminal phosphodi-
ester bond of the primer strand is hydrolyzed in the
exonuclease active center and then the trimmed primer-
end is transferred from the exonuclease to the polymerase
active center where the highly ﬂuorescent +1 complexes
are formed. These steps can be described by the following
equation: 1/kobs=1/145=1/khydrolysis+1/kexo-to-pol trans-
fer+1/k+1complexes. The combined rates for exonuclease-
to-polymerase transfer of the trimmed primer-end and for
formation of the highly ﬂuorescent +1 complexes can be
calculated if the hydrolysis rate is known. The hydrolysis
rate catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase is reported to
be 100 s1 for degradation of single-stranded DNA (9)
and from 176 to 228 s1 (13) for removal of the 2AP
nucleotide from the 30-end of single-stranded DNA.
Because the hydrolysis rate must be faster than the
observed overall rate of 145 3 s1detected in our
experiments, the true hydrolysis rate is likely closer to
200 s1, the average rate reported for removal of a
terminal 2AP nucleotide (13). The combined rates for
exonuclease-to-polymerase switching and formation of
the highly ﬂuorescent complex with 2AP in the +1
position can be calculated from the following
equation: [1/kexo-to-pol transfer+1/k+1complexes]= 1/kobs
1/khydrolysis=1/1451/200; therefore, [kexo-to-pol transfer+
k

]=526 s1 (Table 1). Thus, once the hydrolysis
reaction takes place, the trimmed primer-end is returned
rapidly to the polymerase active center in position to
resume nucleotide incorporation.
The eﬃcient proofreading reaction that initiates in the
exonuclease active center has several implications for
understanding proofreading by the T4 DNA polymerase
and Family B DNA polymerases in general. First, the
template strand is likely bound in the polymerase active
center when the primer-end is bound in the exonuclease
active center. Intuitively, it makes sense for the template
strand to be held in the polymerase active center during
proofreading to ensure that the trimmed primer-end will
be returned to the polymerase active center in correct
alignment, otherwise frameshift mutations will be pro-
duced. It is also important that proofreading be limited to
only removing incorrect nucleotides in order to prevent
gratuitous degradation of the newly synthesized DNA,
which would slow DNA replication and waste dNTPs.
Severely reduced DNA replication is observed in T4
infections with mutant DNA polymerases that catalyze
excessive proofreading (23,34). These potential problems
with proofreading can be reduced if the trimmed primer-
end is returned to the polymerase active center in position
to resume replication after an incorrect nucleotide is
removed. If the primer-end is matched, primer extension
will be the favored reaction; however, if the primer-end is
not correct or if the primer-end is misaligned, then another
cycle of proofreading will be favored over primer
extension.
Several observations are consistent with the proposal
that the template strand is held in the polymerase active
center when the primer-end is bound in the exonuclease
active center. Moderate ﬂuorescence enhancement is
observed for 2AP in the n and +1 positions in the
template strand in exonuclease complexes (25,29,35),
which is the starting point of the ﬂuorescence assay
shown in Figure 5A. The rapid transfer (4500 s1) of the

trimmed primer-end from the exonuclease to the poly-
merase active center to form the highly ﬂuorescent +1
complexes (the end point of the ﬂuorescence assay shown
in Figure 5A) is also consistent with the template strand
being held in the polymerase active center since the +1
complexes are poised for rapid nucleotide incorporation
(26,29). Furthermore, the ability of the T4 DNA
polymerase to remove two incorrect nucleotides under
single turnover conditions (Figure 6) suggests that the
trimmed primer-end can be eﬃciently shuttled back-and-
forth between the exonuclease and polymerase active
centers, which can only reasonably occur if the template
strand remains bound in the polymerase active center.
How does the T4 DNA polymerase transfer the primer-
end between the polymerase and exonuclease active
centers? The apparent rapid rate for return of the trimmed
primer-end to the polymerase active center—4500 s1
indicates that exonuclease-to-polymerase switching is
rapid once the terminal phosphodiester bond is cleaved.
Thus, the primer-end may ‘spring’ back to the polymerase
active center unassisted once the terminal phosphodiester
bond is cleaved. This proposal is supported by the
observation that while a b hairpin structure in the
exonuclease domain is important for forming stable
exonuclease complexes (10,13–15), this structure is not
needed for return of the trimmed primer-end to the
polymerase active center (15). However, deletion of
the loop in the b hairpin structure reduces the ability of
the RB69 DNA polymerase to remove two incorrect
nucleotides (15). Thus, the b hairpin may have a role in
assisting further strand separation and reformation of
exonuclease complexes for the second proofreading cycle.
The overall rate for removing two incorrect nucleotides
is 55 s1 (Table 1, Figure 6). The calculated overall rate
for removing the ﬁrst incorrect nucleotide is 88.5 s1 if
removal of the second nucleotide occurs at the same rate
as removal of a singly incorrect nucleotide—145 s1. We
propose that the trimmed primer-end is returned to the
polymerase active center after removal of an incorrect
nucleotide where the accuracy of the primer-end is
evaluated based on the ability of the primer-end to form
hydrogen bonds with the complementary template bases.
Thus, the 88.5 s1 rate includes transfer of the primer-end
back-and-forth between the exonuclease and polymerase
active centers plus an intervening evaluation of the primer-
end in the polymerase active center. The rate for these
combined exo-to-pol/evaluation/pol-to-exo steps can be
calculated from the following equation: 1/kexo-to-pol/evalua-
tion/pol-to-exo=1/kremoval of 1st nucleotide 1/khydrolysis=1/
88.5–1/200=0.0063; thus, kexo-to-pol/evaluation/pol-to-
exo=159 s
1 (Table 1).
Processive proofreading for reactions that initiate in the
exonuclease active center appear to be limited to removal
of two incorrect nucleotides because removal of three
incorrect nucleotides is not reported to occur (12) or to
take place less eﬃciently than removal of one or two
incorrect nucleotides (15). We conclude from this observa-
tion that the removal of a third incorrect nucleotide
involves a heparin-sensitive step that is not present for
removal of the ﬁrst two incorrect nucleotides. This step is
presumably slower than enzyme dissociation.
What is the role of the clamp in proofreading? We could
not detect any intrinsic processive proofreading for
reactions that initiated in the polymerase active center
(Figure 5A), but proofreading is stimulated by the clamp
protein, the product of T4 gene 45 (21,22). Proofreading
could be stimulated if the clamp allows intramolecular
polymerase-to-exonuclease switching without dissociation
of the DNA polymerase from the DNA. If this is the case,
then tethering the DNA polymerase to the DNA allows
strand separation and transfer of the primer-end from the
polymerase to the exonuclease active center, even if the
rate is slower than the rate for enzyme dissociation.
Another possibility is that polymerase-to-exonuclease
active site switching is intermolecular. Given the eﬃcient
ability of the T4 DNA polymerase to proofread mis-
matched DNAs by forming exonuclease complexes
directly without ﬁrst forming polymerase complexes
[Figures 5A and 6; (12,15,32)], the T4 DNA polymerase
may normally dissociate from the DNA substrate when a
wrong nucleotide is incorporated, even when clamped to
the DNA, and then rebind to form exonuclease complexes
with the mismatched DNA. The mismatched DNA may
be rebound by the same or another DNA polymerase.
The proposal of enzyme dissociation has merit because
the concept of processivity in DNA replication has
recently been redeﬁned for the T4 DNA polymerase.
Yang et al. (36) demonstrated that T4 DNA polymerases
exchange during DNA replication and that this exchange
requires the clamp. Since the clamp can potentially bind
the replicating DNA polymerase and a ‘spare’ DNA
polymerase, incorporation of a wrong nucleotide may lead
to dissociation of the replicating DNA polymerase and
then the spare DNA polymerase forms an exonuclease
complex with the mismatched DNA (20,37). The role of
the clamp then is to provide a locally high concentration
of spare DNA polymerases at replication forks for
exonucleolytic proofreading. This proposal could explain
why reduced concentrations of DNA polymerase d in
yeast produces a mutator phenotype (38). If reduced
concentrations of DNA polymerase d means that there is
not always a tethered spare for exonucleolytic proof-
reading, then proofreading would be reduced. This
situation could also provide increased opportunity for
replication by a translesion DNA polymerase such as
DNA polymerase z, which lacks proofreading activity.
This scenario also provides a possible mechanism to
explain how DNA polymerase d can proofread for DNA
polymerase a (39) or for a translesion DNA polymerase to
take over replication when DNA damage blocks replica-
tive DNA polymerases (36).
One last point to consider is what happens with mutant
DNA polymerases that have reduced ability to catalyze
the exonuclease reaction. The exonuclease deﬁcient
D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase has almost no detect-
able ability to carry out removal of an incorrect terminal
nucleotide or to extend the mismatched primer terminus
under single-turnover conditions (Figure 2C, lane 6); the
W213S-DNA polymerase has only limited ability to do so
(Figure 2C, lane 4). The W213S-DNA polymerase slowly
removed (1.5 s1) the terminal dTMP nucleotide from the
DNA substrate with 2AP in the n position and this activity

was observed only in the absence of the heparin trap
(Table 1). Increased base substitution mutations are
observed for both mutant DNA polymerases in vivo as
expected if proofreading activity is reduced (16). Mutant
T4 DNA polymerases with reduced ability to catalyze the
hydrolysis reaction also produce increased frameshift
mutations, which is not observed to the same extent for
other mutant DNA polymerases that are defective in
proofreading but still retain signiﬁcant hydrolysis activity
(40, unpublished data). One intriguing question is what
happens if the terminal nucleotide is not removed, as is
expected to be the case for the hydrolysis-defective DNA
polymerases? Will the uncorrected primer-end be returned
to the polymerase active center? If so, will the primer-end
be correctly aligned? Since increased frameshift mutagen-
esis is observed for mutant DNA polymerases that are
deﬁcient in cleaving the terminal phosphodiester bond,
strand misalignments may be a consequence of aberrant
proofreading reactions.
SUMMARY
The proofreading pathway catalyzed by the bacteriophage
T4 DNA polymerase is presented in Figure 7. The
experiments presented in this report begin with preformed
exonuclease complexes, but association rates were
determined in previous experiments and range from
70 to 120 s1 depending on the DNA sequence,
which correspond to bimolecular association rates of
24 108M1 s1 (14,32). In pathway I for removal of a
single incorrect nucleotide, exonuclease complexes are
formed directly in which the primer-end is bound in the
exonuclease active center and the template strand is bound
in the polymerase active center. Hydrolysis (200 s1) and
rapid transfer (4500 s1) of the trimmed primer-end to
the polymerase active center produces a DNA polymerase
complex (identiﬁed by an asterisk ) that is poised to
resume rapid nucleotide incorporation.
For DNA substrates with two incorrect nucleotides at
the primer-end (pathway II), exonuclease complexes are
again formed. The terminal wrong (W) nucleotide is
excised, then we propose that the trimmed primer-end is
transferred to the polymerase active center (step a) as
happens for removal of a single wrong nucleotide.
However, since the primer-end still has a wrong nucleo-
tide, the incorrect primer-end is returned to the exonu-
clease active center (step b) for a second cycle of excision.
The overall rate for steps a+b is calculated to be 159 s1
(Table 1). The second wrong nucleotide is then removed as
described for pathway I.
Intrinsic processive proofreading was not detected for
reactions that initiate in the polymerase active center,
pathway III. We observed a rate of 11 s1 in multiple
turnover reactions for the DNA substrate used in
experiments reported here (Table 1), which involves
dissociation of the DNA polymerase from a complex
that is inactive for the excision reaction and then
formation of an active exonuclease complex. Although
the apparent rate for initiating the proofreading reaction
in the polymerase active center is slow, 11 s1, this rate is
still much faster than the rate for extending a mismatched
primer terminus (11), but is slower than the rate
for extension of a matched primer terminus (26,29).
Thus, the 11 s1 rate is a barrier to gratuitous proof-
reading, but is fast enough to prevent extension of a

center are illustrated for a single terminal incorrect nucleotide (I) and for two terminal incorrect nucleotides (II). Proofreading that initiates in the
polymerase active center is illustrated by pathway III. Details are presented in the Discussion section.

mismatched primer terminus. We propose that the
presence of the clamp will not aﬀect the 11 s1 rate as
the clamp is thought to act only as a tether, but the clamp
will allow either the same DNA polymerase that
incorporated the incorrect nucleotide or a spare DNA
polymerase that is co-tethered to form exonuclease
complexes with the mismatched DNA.
