The genus Nocardiopsis was shown to be phylogenetically coherent and to represent a distinct lineage within 
the radiation of the order Actinomycetales. The closest relatives of the genus Nocardiopsis are members of the 
genera Actinomadura, Thermomonospora, Streptosporangium, and Microtetraspora. The intrageneric structure of 
the genus Nucardiupsis is shown to consist of a highly related species group containing Nucardiupsis dassonvillei, 
Nocardiopsis alborubida, and Nocardiopsis antarctica and a second group of less highly related species compris- 
ing Nocardiopsis alba subs p. alba, Nocardiopsis alba subs p. prasina, and Nocardiopsis listeri. Nocardiopsis lucen- 
tensis occupies a position intermediate between the two species groups. The results of a 16s ribosomal DNA 
sequence analysis are generally consistent with the available chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, and DNA-DNA 
hybridization data. The phylogenetic position and the morpho- and chemotaxonomic properties of Nocardiopsis 
species support the creation of a family for the genus Nocardiopsis, Nocardiopsaceae fam. nov. 
Meyer described the genus Nocardiopsis for the species Ac- 
tinomadura dassonvillei in 1976 on the basis of the morpholog- 
ical characteristics and cell wall type of this organism (21). The 
genus Nocardiopsis currently comprises seven validly described 
species, Nocardiopsis alborubidus, Nocardiopsis albus, Nocar- 
diopsis antarcticus, Nocardiopsis dassonvillei, Nocardiopsis halo- 
phila, Nocardiopsis listen, and Nocardiopsis lucentensis. Nocar- 
diopsis albus includes two subspecies, Nocardiopsis albus subsp. 
albus and Nocardiopsis albus subsp. prasina. Arriving at this 
current taxonomy has involved the exclusion of previously rec- 
ognized Nocardiopsis species and the inclusion of new species 
transferred from other genera. Five species, Nocardiopsis co- 
emleofusca , Nocardiopsis Jlava , Nocardiopsis longispora , Nocar- 
diopsis mutabilis, and Nocardiopsis synngae, were transferred to 
the genus Saccharothrix on the basis of their chemotaxonomic 
characteristics (9, 16), and Kroppenstedt et al. (14) have trans- 
ferred Nocardiopsis afncana to the genus Microtetraspora. 
The following two species were created by Grund and Krop- 
penstedt (10) on the basis of chemotaxonomic and numerical 
taxonomic data: Nocardiopsis alborubidus, for the invalid spe- 
cies “Actinomyces alborubidus”; and Nocardiopsis listeri, for the 
invalid strep tomyce t e “Streptomyces listen’. ” 
The genus Nocardiopsis is currently defined on the basis of 
chemotaxonomic markers, since Nocardiopsis strains cannot be 
differentiated from members of the genus Saccharothrix mor- 
phologically (13, 17). The salient chemotaxonomic features, as 
described previously (13), include phospholipid type 111 (19) 
with the diagnostic phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phos- 
phatidylmethylethanolamine. The menaquinone type is type 4c2 
(13), and the main menaquinones contain 10 isoprene subunits 
in their side chains with variable degrees of saturation. The 
fatty acid type is type 3d (12), and the fatty acids include 
iso-branched, anteiso-branched, and 10-methyl-branched fatty 
acids. High levels of octadecenoic acid (oleic acid) are also

present. Diagnostic for all members of the genus Nocardiopsis 
is the combination of 15 to 20% anteiso-C,,:, (14-methylhexa- 
decanoic acid) together with 20 to 25% 10-methyl-C,,,, (tu- 
berculostearic acid; 10-methyl-octadecanoic acid) or its precur- 
sor, oleic acid (7, 12, 22). This combination of fatty acids is 
unique among bacteria and can be used to differentiate No- 
cardiopsis species from all other bacteria. The peptidoglycan 
contains meso-diaminopimelic acid, and no diagnostic sugars 
are present (cell wall chemotype III/C [18]). Other chemotaxo- 
nomic features include a lack of mycolic acids, the presence of 
muramic acid of the acetyl type, and DNA G+C contents 
between 64 and 69 mol% (13). The combination of these 
characteristics can be used to differentiate Nocardiopsis species 
from other actinomycetes. 
Differentiation of Nocardiopsis species is currently based on 
the color of the mycelium and the results of comparative phys- 
iological tests (13). Recently, the presence of novel cell wall 
teichoic acids has been reported in Nocardiopsis species (24, 
25). The authors of these studies suggested that species-spe- 
cific teichoic acids are present in Nocardiopsis dassonvillei, No- 
cardiopsis antarcticus, and Nocardiopsis albus subsp. albus, but 
until this trait has been examined for all Nocardiopsis species, 
its taxonomic value will remain unknown. 
In recent years the application of rRNA sequence analysis to 
the systematics of the actinomycetes has helped bring some 
order to the taxonomy of this phylum. The combination of new 
data from rRNA analyses with previously available phenotypic 
information has given us a better understanding of the true 
relationships among various actinomycete taxa. The recent re- 
view of Embley and Stackebrandt (4) provided a comprehen- 
sive overview of the phylogenetic structure of the actinomyce- 
tes. In this review, Nocardiopsis dassonvillei was considered an 
actinomycete of uncertain phylogenetic affiliation, but was ten- 
tatively placed between the family Thermornonosporaceae (2) 
and the family Streptosporangiaceae (8). Although the genus 
Nocardiopsis is phylogenetically related to these families, it can 
be excluded from them by its unique combination of chemot- 
axonomic markers. 
In order to clarify the phylogenetic position of the genus 
Nocardiopsis and to investigate the phylogenetic coherence of

this genus, 16s ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence data were 
obtained from all available type strains and analyzed. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Strains and culture conditions. The actinomycete strains investigated in this 
study are listed in Table 1. Cell material for DNA extraction was grown on DSM 
medium 65 (3). The wet biomass used for fatty acid analysis was obtained from 
cultures grown in Trypticase soy broth (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, 
Md.) for 4 days at 28°C. 
Preparation of genomic DNA and amplification of the 16s rJWA gene. A 
single colony was removed from an agar surface and dispersed in 400 p1 of 
saline-EDTA buffer (150 mM NaCI, 10 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). The resulting 
preparation was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, after 5 p1 of a lysozyme solution 
(10 mg/ml) was added. Then 5 p,l of a proteinase K solution (15 mg/ml) and 10 
p1 of a sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (25%, wthol) were added; this was 
followed by incubation at 55°C for 30 min. The lysatc was extracted with an equal 
volume of phenol, and this was followed by centrifugation. An equal volume of 
chloroform was added to the aqueous layer, and the preparation was mixed and 
centrifuged. DNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by using a Prep-A- 
Gene kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). The purified DNA was eluted from the 
binding matrix in 50 pl of sterile distilled H20. 
The 16s rDNA was amplified by the PCR in a reaction mixture containing 1 X 
PCR buffer (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), each deoxynucleoside triphos- 
phate at a concentration of 200 pM, 50 to 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 pg of 
primer 27f (S‘GAGTM’GATCCTGGCTCAG3’), and 0.5 pg of primer 1525r 
(S’AGAAAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC3’). The final volume of the PCR mixture 
was adjusted to 100 pl by adding distilled H20, and the reaction mixture was 
overlaid with 80 pl of sterile mineral oil. Thermal cycling was performed with a 
model 480 apparatus (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.). The samples were 
subjected to an initial denaturing step consisting of 3 min at 98”C, after which 2 
U of Taq polymerase was added to each sample at 90°C. The thermal profile used 
was 28 cycles consisting of 1 min of primer annealing at 52”C, 2 min of extension 
at 72”C, and 1 min of denaturation at 94°C. A final extension step consisting of 
5 min at 72°C was also included. PCR amplificants were detected by agarose gel 
electrophoresis and were visualized by UV fluorescence after ethidium bromide 
staining. 
Direct sequencing of PCR products. PCR products were purified and concen- 
trated by using a Prep-A-Gene kit (Bio-Rad). DNA was eluted in 50 pl of 
distilled H,O, and 0.5 to 1.0 pl of the resulting preparation was used in sequenc- 
ing reactions. The sequencing reactions were performed with a PRISM Ready- 
Reaction DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit by using Amplitaq FS (Ap- 
plied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and a Perkin-Elmer Cetus model 9600 
thermal cycler according to the protocol and thermal profile recommended by 
Applied Biosystems. The sequencing primers used were primers 343r (5’CTGC 
TGCCTCCCGTA3’), 357f (5‘TACGGGAGGCAGCAG3’), 519r (5’G[T/A]AT 
TACCGCGGC[T/G]GCTG3’), 536f (5’CAGC[C/A]GCCGCGGTAAT[T/A]C 
3‘), 803f (S’AlTAGATACCCTGGTAG3’), 907r (S‘CCGTCAATTCATITGA 
GTIT3’), 1114f (S‘GCAACGAGCGCAACCC3‘), and 1385r (S’CGGTGTGT 
[A/G]CAAGGCCC3’). Sequence reaction mixtures were purified as recom- 
mended by Applied Biosystems and were electrophoresed on a 6% (wt/vol) 
polyacrylamide sequencing gel for 12 h by using an Applied Biosystems model 
373A automated DNA sequencer. 
Phylogenetic analysis. The 16s rDNA sequences obtained in this study were 
manually aligned with actinomycete reference sequences obtained from the 
Ribosomal Database Project (20). Because many of the actinomycete reference 
sequences obtained from databases were partial sequences consisting of less than 
1,300 nucleotides, two data sets were produced. The data set comprising the 
sequences generated in this study and the actinomycete reference sequences 
contained information for 1,236 unambiguous nucleotide positions present in all 
sequences between positions 51 and 1471 (Escherichia coli numbering [l]). When 
only the Nocardiopsis sequences generated in this study and the sequence of 
Microtetraspora glauca were used, a second data set, which contained information 
for 1,437 unambiguous nucleotide positions present in these sequences between 
positions 34 and 1500 (E. coli numbering [l]), was produced. Evolutionary 
distances were calculated by the method of Jukes and Cantor (11). Phylogenetic 
dendrograrns were reconstructed by using treeing algorithms contained in the 
PHYLIP package (6). Tree topologies were evaluated by performing bootstrap 
analyses (5) of the neighbor-joining data, using 1,000 resamplings. 
Saponification, methylation, extraction, and analysis of fatty acid methyl 
esters. Fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from wet biomass (ca. 40 mg) by 
saponification, methylation, and extraction (15). The fatty acid methyl ester 
mixtures were separated by using a model 5898A microbial identification system 
apparatus (Microbial ID, Newark, Del.). The fatty acid data obtained for the 
strains were compared qualitatively and quantitatively by using Ward’s method 
(26) and the Microbial Identification System Library Generation software (Mi- 
crobial ID, Newark, Del.). 
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The 16s rDNA sequences deter- 
mined in this study have been deposited in the EMBL data library under the 
accession numbers shown in Table 1. The accession numbers of the sequences of 
the strains used as representatives of the main actinomycete groups are as fol-

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Correction of names. In the descriptions of some Nocardio- 
psis species and subspecies, the names were incorrectly de- 
rived. The names are therefore corrected as follows: Nucar- 
diopsis alborubida corrig. (for Nocardiopsis alborubidus [sic]), 
Nocardiopsis antarctica corrig. (for Nocardiopsis antarcticus [sic]), 
Nocardiopsis alba subsp. alba corrig. (for Nocardiopsis albus 
subsp. albus [sic]), and Nocardiopsis alba subsp. prasina corrig. 
(for Nocardiopsis albus subsp. prasina [sic]). The correct names 
are used below. 
Phylogenetic analyses. Almost complete 16s rDNA se- 
quence data (>95% of the E. coli sequence [l]) were obtained 
for the type strains of six species of Nocardiopsis, including the 
type strains of the two subspecies of Nocardiopsis alba. Se- 
quence data could not be obtained for Nocardiopsis halophila 
as a culture was not provided when it was requested from the 
original authors. Five new reference sequences were deter- 
mined for the type strains of Actinomadura madurae, Actino- 
madura kijaniata , Themomonospora cuwata , Microtetraspora 
glauca, and Microtetraspora salmonea in order to include in the 
comparison the type species of three genera that are consid- 
ered related to the genus Nocardiopsis (4). 
The phylogenetic dendrogram shown in Fig. 1 was recon- 
structed from evolutionary distances by the neighbor-joining 
method. A total of 1,236 nucleotides present in all strains 
between position 51 and position 1471 (E. coli numbering [l]) 
were used for this analysis. Phylogenetic analyses in which the 
maximum-likelihood and unrooted parsimony methods were 
used produced very similar results. A phylogenetic analysis 
based on a comparison of the 16s rDNA sequence data 
showed that the genus Nocardiopsis is phylogenetically homo- 
geneous, with all six species forming a distinct lineage within 
the radiation of the actinomycetes (Fig. 1).

(ATSM) group were found with all of the phylogenetic analysis 
methods used. The relationship of the genus Nocardiopsis to 
the ATSM cluster was supported by a bootstrap value of 100%. 
The levels of 16s rDNA sequence similarity between the mem- 
bers of the Nocardiopsis cluster and the members of the ATSM 
group and between the members of the Nocardiopsis cluster 
and the members of other actinomycete lineages were 91.4 to 
93.6 and 82.2 to 91.9%, respectively. These data clearly indi- 
cate that the phylogenetic position of the Nocardiopsis lineage 
is isolated and that this taxon does not fall within the radiation 
of the families Thermomonosporaceae and Streptosporangiaceae 
or the other families currently placed in the order Actinomy- 
cetales. 
The phylogenetic distances between the Nocardiopsis species 
cluster and the ATSM group (levels of sequence dissimilarity, 
6.7 to 9.2%) and between the Nocardiopsis species cluster and 
representatives of other actinomycete lineages (levels of se- 
quence dissimilarity, 8.6 to 20.3%) can be recognized at the 
level of the primary structure of the 16s rDNA. There are 
signature nucleotides which distinguish the genus Nocardiopsis 
from members of the ATSM group (Table 2). Although the 
majority of the Nocardiopsis-specific nucleotides are single 
nonpairing bases that are widely dispersed in the primary struc- 
ture and thus of little value as targets for specific oligonucle- 
otide probes or primers, the region from position 1435 to 
position 1466, containing eight signature nucleotides, could be 
used as a target site. In addition to these unique nucleotides, a 
long helix similar to that found in the slowly growing Myco- 
hactenum species was found between E. coli positions 455 and 
479 in all six Nocardiopsts species investigated. This extended 
loop can be considered an additional genus characteristic; the

Intrageneric structure of the genus Nocardiopsis. The intra- 
generic relationships based on comparisons of the 16s rDNA 
sequences of the six Nocardiopsis species investigated in this 
study are shown in Fig. 2, which was derived from a compar- 
ison of the nucleotides at 1,437 base positions, as indicated 
above. The corresponding 16s rDNA sequence similarity val- 
ues are shown in Table 3. These data clearly demonstrate that 
the genus Nocardiopsis is a phylogenetically shallow taxon; the 
levels of sequence similarity for the Nocardiopsis strains are 
between 97.8 and 99.7% (Table 3). Nocardiopsis dassonvillei, 
Nocardiopsis alborubida, and Nocardiopsis antarctica form one 
cluster (levels of 16s rDNA sequence similarity, 99.5 to 99.7%), 
which is supported by a bootstrap value of 99%. Nocardiopsts 
alba subsp. alba, Nocardiopsis alba subsp. prasina, and Nocar- 
diopsis listen cluster together loosely, and the branching pat-

tern of these organisms is not supported by bootstrap analysis 
data. Although Nocardiopsis lucentensis branches between 
these two clusters, the levels of sequence similarity between the 
species belonging to the second cluster are no greater than the 
levels of similarity between these species and Nocardiopsis 
lucentensis. The long helix found at E. coli positions 455 to 479 
in all of the Nocardiopsis species investigated has a unique 
sequence in each of the following taxa: Nocardiopsis dassonvil- 
lei, Nocardiopsis alborubida, Nocardiopsis antarctica, Nocardio- 
psis lucentensis, and Nocardiopsis alba subsp. alba. Another 
unique sequence is found at these positions in the Nocardiopsis 
alba subsp. prasina and Nocardiopsis listen strains. Although 
the nucleotide sequence of this stretch may prove to be useful 
for species identification, it is clear that this characteristic has 
little phylogenetic significance since two unrelated taxa, No- 
cardiopsis alba subsp. prasina and Nocardiopsis listen, have the 
same sequence in this region. 
Comparison of phenotype, chemotype, and phylotype. The 
results of the phylogenetic analysis of the six species of the 
genus Nocardiopsis, which demonstrated that this actinomycete 
lineage is distinct, are consistent with the uniqueness of this 
genus shown by phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data. At the 
species level, the close relationship of the six species based on 
16s rDNA sequence analysis data indicates that the species 
boundary should be investigated fully by DNA-DNA hybrid- 
ization analysis. To date, a comprehensive DNA-DNA hybrid- 
ization study of all Nocardiopsis species has not been carried 
out. However, the limited DNA-DNA hybridization data pre- 
sented in the description of Nocardiopsis lucentensis (27) could 
be compared with the 16s rDNA sequence analysis data. These 
DNA-DNA hybridization data demonstrated that Nocardiopsis 
lucentensis is a true species when this organism was compared 
with Nocardiopsis dassonvillei, Nocardiopsis alborubida, Nocar- 
diopsis listen', Nocardiopsis alba subsp. alba , and Nocardiopsis 
alba subsp. prasina (levels of DNA-DNA binding, 40 to 46%). 
An additional Nocardiopsis strain, designated strain (which 
was not investigated in this study), was found to be phenotyp- 
ically identical to Nocardiopsis lucentensis, but on the basis of a 
DNA-DNA binding value of 39% was clearly not related. This 
strain exhibited 65 and 63% DNA-DNA binding to Nocardio- 
psis dassonyillei and Nocardiopsis alborubida, respectively, which 
indicated that the latter two taxa are closely related. This 
relationship was reflected in the phylogeny derived from the 
16s rDNA sequence analysis performed in this study. 
There is some correlation between the results of the phylo- 
genetic analysis based on 16s rDNA sequence data and the 
results of the cluster analysis of fatty acid composition data 
(Fig. 3). On the basis of quantitative differences in their fatty 
acid patterns, the Nocardiopsis species can be separated into 
three clusters. As demonstrated in the 16s rDNA sequence 
analysis, Nocardiopsis dassonvillei, Nocardiopsis antarctica, and 
Nocardiopsis alborubida are similar, while Nocardiopsis listen, 
Nocardiopsis alba subsp. alba , and Nocardiopsis alba subsp. 
prasina also cluster together. Nocardiopsis lucentensis has a 
distinct fatty acid type, which is not similar to the fatty acid 
types of the other Nocardiopsis species. The close relationship 
between Nocardiopsis dassonvillei and Nocardiopsis antarctica 
is also supported by the presence of a unique cell wall teichoic 
acid which has been found in these two species (24), while a 
different teichoic acid has been found in Nocardiopsis alba 
subsp. alba (25). 
In contrast, there is little correlation between the phyloge- 
netic data and the menaquinone composition data available. 
Grund and Kroppenstedt (10) found that Nocardiopsis dasson- 
villei and the two subspecies of Nocardiopsis alba have the same 
menaquinone composition. A different menaquinone compo- 
sition was found for Nocardiopsis alborubida and Nocardiopsis 
listen (lo), while a third type was reported for Nocardiopsis 
lucentensis (27). This apparent lack of congruence provides 
another example of the difficulties involved in comparing the 
evolution of menaquinones (9). 
A comparison of the 16s rDNA sequence data obtained in 
this study and the results of the numerical taxonomic analysis 
of Grund and Kroppenstedt (10) is of little value, as the inclu- 
sion of chemotaxonomic characters (i.e., menaquinone com- 
position) in the latter study led to the placement of Nocardio- 
psis alborubida and Nocardiopsis listen' in an isolated position. 
The former species was placed outside the Nocardiopsis species 
cluster, while the latter species appeared to be no more similar 
to the Nocardiopsis alba subspecies than to Nocardiopsis das- 
sonvillei. 
In conclusion, a phylogenetic analysis based on the results of 
a 16s rDNA sequence comparison revealed that the genus 
Nocardiopsis represents a distinct lineage within the actinomy- 
cetes and hence is a taxonomically valid genus which exhibits 
some relatedness to the ATSM group. On the basis of the

chemotaxonomic properties of the genus Nocardiopsis, we pro- 
pose that a new family should be created for this genus. The 
genus Nocardiopsh contains very closely related species. Wheth- 
er the six Nocardiopsis species investigated in this study repre- 
sent genomically well-separated species cannot be decided on 
the basis of 16s rDNA sequence analysis data; an answer to 
this question will require a comprehensive DNA-DNA hybrid- 
ization study involving all available species of the genus No- 
ca rdiopsis.
