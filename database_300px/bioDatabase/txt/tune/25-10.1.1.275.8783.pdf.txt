ABSTRACT
Secondary structures of the G-rich strand of human
telomere DNA fragments G3(TTAG3)n, n = 1–16, have
been studied by means of circular dichroism spectro-
scopy and PAGE, in solutions of physiological potas-
sium cation concentrations. It has been found that
folding of these fragments into tetraplexes as well
as tetraplex thermostabilities and enthalpy values
depend on the number of TTAG3 repeats. The sugges-
ted topologies include, e.g. antiparallel and parallel
bimolecular tetraplexes, an intramolecular antiparal-
lel tetraplex, a tetraplex consisting of three parallel
chains and one antiparallel chain, a poorly stable par-
allel intramolecular tetraplex, and both parallel and
antiparallel tetramolecular tetraplexes. G3(TTAG3)3
folds into a single, stable and very compact intra-
molecular antiparallel tetraplex. With an increasing
repeat number, the fragment tetraplexes surprisingly
are ever less thermostable and their migration and
enthalpy decrease indicate increasing irregularities
or domain splitting in their arrangements. Reduced
stability and different topology of lengthy telomeric
tails could contribute to the stepwise telomere
shortening process.
INTRODUCTION
Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear and have telomeres at their
ends (1). A ribonucleoprotein complex, telomerase, ensures
replication of the telomere (2). The telomere DNA is com-
posed of the (TTAGGG)n/(CCCTAA)n repeats in humans and
the G-rich strand forms a single-stranded overhang on the 30
end of the molecule (3). The overhang folds into a hairpin
containing guanine–guanine base pairs (4–6), or a DNA guan-
ine tetraplex (7) under suitable conditions. The tetraplexes
were detected in vivo (8–10), they are recognized by some
proteins (11–14) and are probable to play an important role in
telomerase regulation (15,16). The telomerase is inhibited by
guanine tetraplex structures (17). Telomeres are highly con-
served in human chromosomes (18); their length, however, is
heterogeneous (19). The length of the telomeric DNA is
related to aging and cancer (20,21). For example, telomere
shortening triggers a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest via accu-
mulation of G-rich single-stranded DNA fragments (22).
Guanine tendency to association has been known for many
years (23–26). X-ray crystallographic (27,28) and solution
NMR (29,30) studies showed that oligonucleotides related
to telomere repeats associated into various types of tetraplex
structures. Short oligonucleotides such as TTAG3, TG3T
or TTG4 associate into tetramolecular parallel-stranded tet-
raplexes (31–33). Longer fragments generate hairpins associ-
ating into bimolecular tetraplexes in which the two hairpin
strands have an antiparallel alignment (32). The human telo-
meric DNA sequence AG3(TTAG3)3 was shown (29) to form
an intramolecular tetraplex in which each strand had one
parallel and one antiparallel neighbor. Quite a different tet-
raplex type was observed (34) in crystals of human telomere
DNA fragments TAG3TTAG3T and AG3(TTAG3)3. Their
bimolecular and intramolecular tetraplexes contained parallel
strands with three linking trinucleotide loops positioned
on the sides of the quadruplex core, in a propeller-like
arrangement (34).
Telomeric G-rich DNA fragments were studied by a number
of methods (35–38) including circular dichroism (CD) spec-
troscopy (39–46). Parallel tetraplexes provide diagnostic CD
spectra dominated by a strong positive band at 260 nm whereas
antiparallel tetraplexes have the positive band at 290 nm
(39,47). However, we have frequently observed CD spectra
characteristic of parallel tetraplexes even with intramolecular
and bimolecular tetraplexes that apparently should be antipar-
allel. For a long time, we had been wrestling with the question
of how it is possible that CD spectroscopy, which is such a
sensitive and reliable indicator of DNA secondary structure,
fails in this case. The solution was the same as in previous
cases. CD spectroscopy provided correct information. The
explanation was found thanks to the crystal structures show-
ing (34) that loops of bimolecular as well as intramolecular

tetraplexes can be located on the sides of the tetraplex core,
permitting to preserve the parallel orientation of the strands.
Here we take advantage of this knowledge to study guanine
tetraplex topology of human telomere DNA fragments differ-
ing by the number of (TTAG3) repeats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The oligonucleotides were purchased from VBC Genomics
Bioscience Research (Vienna). The lyophilized oligonuc-
leotides were dissolved in 1 mM sodium phosphate and
0.3 mM EDTA, pH 7, to give a stock solution concentration
of 100 OD/ml. The precise sample concentrations were
determined from their absorption measured at 90C in the
above buffer using molar extinction coefficients calculated
according to Gray et al. (48). The UV absorption spectra
were measured on a UNICAM 5625 UV/VIS spectrometer.
Before starting the experiments, the samples of the G-rich
oligonucleotides were denatured (100 at 90C) in the above
low salt solution to remove aggregates. The sample was then
left to cool to room temperature. The salt was added to the
denatured sample at 0C or at room temperature and the
formation of tetraplexes was followed. In this way the CD
spectral changes were reproducible starting from the same
initial conditions.
CD spectra were measured using a Jobin-Yvon Mark VI
dichrograph in 0.1 and 1 cm pathlength Hellma cells, placed in
a thermostatted holder. The DNA concentration was chosen to
give an absorption of 0.6–0.8 at the absorption maximum,
which gives an optimum signal-to-noise ratio. CD was
expressed as the difference in the molar absorption of the
right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized light, De,
in units of M1 cm1. To compare the oligonucleotides of
different lengths and different primary structures, the molarity
(M) was related to the number of guanine residues in the
DNA samples.
The pH values were adjusted using either HCl or NaOH and
checked directly in CD cells using a Sentron Red-Line elec-
trode and a Sentron Titan pH meter. The buffer was sodium
or potassium phosphate. KCl or NaCl were also added directly
to the cells. The salt and DNA concentrations were then
corrected for the increase of the sample volume.
Non-denaturing PAGE was performed in a thermostatted
submersible apparatus (SE-600; Hoefer Scientific, San
Francisco). Gels (16%, 29:1 monomer/bis ratio), 14 cm ·
16 cm · 0.1 cm in size, were run for 20 h at 70 V (5 V/cm)
and 0C. DNA (2–3 mg) (10 ml of 0.7 mM DNA) was loaded
on gels. The electrophoreses were run in the Robinson-Britton
buffer pH 7.2 (26 mM mixture of boric, phosphoric and acetic
acids plus 69 mM NaOH). Heteroduplexes of the studied
oligonucleotides with their complementary C-rich strands
were used as length markers. They were formed by mixing
equimolar concentrations of both strands in low salt (1 mM Na
phosphate plus 0.3 mM EDTA, pH 7) solution, heating to
90C, followed by slow annealing to room temperature.
The gels were stained with Stains-All (Sigma). Densitometry
was performed using a Personal Densitometer SI, Model
375-A (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).
The enthalpy of the individual tetraplexes was determined
from the melting curves generated by monitoring a 290 nm
CD band as a function of temperature according to (49). The
transition enthalpy values were estimated only for fragments
that melt in a two-state manner. The melting was measured
in 10 mM potassium phosphate plus 0.15 M KCl, pH 7.
RESULTS
The results of this study follow from comparative CD spec-
troscopy, gel migration and UV absorption experiments on a
set of 20 oligonucleotides containing pieces of human
telomere DNA of various lengths and starting and terminal
nucleotides. Here we mostly deal with the ‘blunt-ended’ frag-
ments, as the TTA residues on the 50 or 30 molecule ends
influence DNA tetraplex formation. The influence is, however,
distinct in short and long molecules. Major conclusions of the
paper are not influenced by the TTA tails. The study takes
advantage of our experience with CD spectroscopy, which
sensitively and reliably discriminates among various DNA
secondary structures including variants of guanine tetraplexes
(47). We have also used gel migration reflecting the number of
associated molecules in the tetraplexes and compactness of
their folding and UV absorption that reflects guanine tetraplex
formation as well (50).
The first oligonucleotide studied is G3TTAG3. This 9mer
provided a CD spectrum at low salt concentration (1 mM Na
phosphate, 0.3 mM EDTA and pH 7, room temperature) cor-
responding to a denatured single strand (Figure 1, left).
Sodium as well as potassium cations generated a dominant
positive CD band at 290 nm reflecting the presence of an
antiparallel-stranded guanine tetraplex (Figure 1, left).
Changes in the UV absorption spectrum, i.e. hypochromism
of the absorption maximum and mainly the increase of
absorption at 295 nm, as compared with the denatured sample,
also hint (50) at guanine tetraplex formation (Figure 1, inset).
The antiparallel tetraplex, however, is unstable at 150 mM KCl
because it isomerizes, with very slow kinetics (days), into a
structure providing a dominant CD band at 260 nm, diagnostic
(39,40) of a parallel guanine tetraplex. This isomerization is
facilitated by increasing temperature. However, the isomer-
ization was not finished at any conditions tested so that the
oligonucleotide always coexisted in the antiparallel and par-
allel guanine tetraplexes in K+-containing solutions. In line
with this conclusion following from the CD spectroscopy
studies, gel migration revealed a coexistence of two bimolecu-
lar species of G3TTAG3 (Figure 2). One migrated faster than
the heteroduplex of G3TTAG3 with the complementary strand
C3TAAC3 and the other migrated more slowly. The faster
species probably corresponds to the antiparallel tetraplex,
and the slower one—whose population increases with time and
temperature—to the parallel tetraplex. No such isomerization
towards the parallel tetraplex was observed with G3TTAG3
in the presence of Na+ ions. In the presence of K+, a similar
oligonucleotide TAG3TTAG3T crystallized (34) as a peculiar
bimolecular tetraplex with a parallel orientation of strands
whose loops were located on the sides of the tetraplex core
(see the sketch in Figure 1). This oligonucleotide, however,
adopted not only this parallel but also an antiparallel tetraplex
in aqueous solution containing K+ ions (38). Our CD (Figure 1,
right) and gel migration (Figure 2) data consistently demon-
strated that TAG3TTAG3T coexisted in two bimolecular
tetraplexes. Exposure to higher temperatures shifted the equi-
librium to the side of the parallel tetraplex. Simultaneously,
5852 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 18
the population of the slower electrophoretic band increased.
Both of these related oligonucleotides thus form both anti-
parallel and parallel bimolecular tetraplexes in K+-containing
solutions. The 9mer G3TTAG3 isomerizes between the two
conformers by means of a two-state process.
The intramolecular tetraplex of AG3(TTAG3)3 was also
parallel-stranded with the loops on the sides in the crystal
(34). However, this oligonucleotide generated an antiparallel
tetraplex in aqueous solution, both in the presence of NaCl or
KCl as indicated by CD (Figure 3). The same was true with
G3(TTAG3)3. This is by far not the first example of DNA
adopting qualitatively different conformers in aqueous solu-
tion and the crystalline state (51). The antiparallel tetraplexes
of G3(TTAG3)3 and AG3(TTAG)3 were formed easily without
any observable kinetics and any annealing. We observed no
CD changes indicating isomerization towards parallel arrange-
ment starting from low to 300 mM concentrations of KCl, after
exposure of the sample to heating to various temperatures
or pH changes. Both AG3(TTAG3)3 and G3(TTAG3)3 always
provided only a single electrophoretic band (Figure 2) irre-
spective of the various solution conditions and irrespective of
various sample treatments. Both oligonucleotides migrated
significantly faster in the gel than would be expected for a

G3(TTAG3)3(C3TAA)3C3 were used as markers for mobility of 18 and 42 base
long fragments, respectively.

single-stranded molecule of the same length (Figure 2). Hence
the antiparallel tetraplexes of AG3(TTAG)3 and G3(TTAG3)3
are strictly defined, very compact monomolecular structures.
Both tetraplexes melted cooperatively with increasing temper-
ature and the melting was a two-state process, consistent with
the above notion of only a single tetraplex at the beginning of
melting. An antiparallel tetraplex of AG3(TTAG3)3 was
observed (29) by NMR in solution in the presence of sodium
cations (Figure 3, sketch).
The CD spectrum of G3(TTAG3)4 in K
+ solutions contains a
decreased positive band at 290 nm compared with G3(TTAG)3
and an additional small positive band at 260 nm (Figure 4).
Similar features were observed in the CD spectrum of
G3TTAG3 (Figure 1). This means that the fourth TTAG3
repeat, containing the fifth G3 block, caused an increase in
conformational features characteristic of a parallel-stranded
tetraplex. In this case, however, there is not a mixture of
two different structures, but a single strict arrangement. No
exchange of 290 and 260 nm bands takes place, in contrast to
the behavior described in Figure 1. The CD spectra neither
change with time nor with temperature within the 0–50C
interval. Melting of the G3(TTAG3)4 tetraplex is a two-state
process (isoelliptic points at 227 and 238 nm; Figure 4,
inset A), which again implies a single melting structure.
Electrophoresis also demonstrates a single intramolecular
species of G3(TTAG3)4 (Figure 5). Hence the data may suggest
that the extra TTAG3 repeat was used to generate a side
loop, so that the resulting tetraplex would contain three
parallel and one antiparallel strands (sketch in Figure 4).
Such a structure consisting of three parallel and one anti-
parallel strands was reported (52) to be formed by a bimole-
cular tetraplex of G3T4G4. Its CD spectrum (Figure 4,
Inset B) is essentially the same as the CD spectrum of
G3(TTAG3)4.

The CD spectrum of G3(TTAG3)7 is very similar to that of
G3(TTAG3)3 (Figure 6). G3(TTAG3)7 migrated slightly faster
than the heteroduplex of G3(TTAG3)3(C3TAA)3C3 (Figure 5)
indicating that G3(TTAG3)7 folded into an intramolecular
tetraplex. The intramolecular antiparallel tetraplex melted
through a two-state process (data not shown) and this oligo-
nucleotide showed no sign of isomerization into an alternative
structure. The thermal stability of the tetraplex of G3(TTAG3)7
was, however, lower than that of G3(TTAG3)3 (see below)
and its migration was not so anomalous (Figure 5). The folding
of G3(TTAG3)7 was therefore not as compact as that of
G3(TTAG3)3.
The CD spectrum of G3(TTAG3)5 displayed an increase
in the 290 nm band and a decrease in that at 260 nm
compared with G3(TTAG3)4 (Figure 7A). The tetraplex of
G3(TTAG3)5 was intramolecular again (Figure 5). We
expected G3(TTAG3)6 to have a suitable primary structure
to generate a parallel tetraplex containing four TTAG3 repeats
in the tetraplex core and three additional repeats in the side
loops observed in the crystal (34). However, this was not the
case. The CD band at 260 nm (characteristic of the parallel
tetraplex) further decreased and that at 290 nm increased
(Figure 7B) as compared with G3(TTAG3)4. It follows from
electrophoretic measurements (Figure 5) that the oligonuc-
leotide formed not only intramolecular but also bimolecular
tetraplexes. However, increasing temperature enhanced, with
long kinetics, the CD band at 260 nm with a simultaneous
compensatory decrease of the CD band at 290 nm. Simultan-
eously the intramolecular tetraplex dominated in this sample
as indicated by electrophoresis run at room temperature (data
not shown). Hence increasing temperature induced a slow
isomerization of the antiparallel tetraplex into a parallel
intramolecular tetraplex, which, however, melted at a relat-
ively low temperature (Figure 8). Thus, the intramolecular
tetraplex, having three TTAG3 repeats in the loops, was rather
unstable (Figure 8). The electrophoretic bands of G3(TTAG3)6

circles). The dotted line with open diamonds simulates mobility of single-stranded molecules.

were diffused (Figure 5), thus indicating conformational
exchanges.
G3(TTAG3)2 behaved in a similar way. A bimolecular
tetraplex, whose core was formed by two repeats of each of
the two participating molecules, had one repeat in the loop, or
an overhang on its 50 or 30 end. It was unstable again and the
oligonucleotide preferred to form tetramolecular tetraplexes
(Figure 5). Increasing temperature led to time-dependent
changes in the CD spectrum (Figure 8), reflecting an isomer-
ization into a parallel tetraplex. Electrophoresis revealed
formation of three kinds of bimolecular tetraplexes, the popu-
lation of which increased with temperature (data not shown),
and two kinds of tetramolecular tetraplexes. The latter tet-
raplexes probably differ by strand orientation. Thus even
tetramolecular tetraplexes may be both parallel-stranded
and antiparallel-stranded. The G3(TTAG3)2 conformation
was relatively thermostable (Figure 8), for which the domin-
ating tetramolecular G3(TTAG3)2 tetraplexes are probably
responsible.
G3(TTAG3)8 only generated an intramolecular tetraplex like
G3(TTAG3)4. G3(TTAG3)9 provided a diffuse band corres-
ponding to an intramolecular tetraplex and a low population
of a bimolecular tetraplex. We observed no isomerization
with these oligonucleotides. Their tetraplex structures prob-
ably are too long to permit formation of side loops. The CD
spectrum remained of the same type, with the dominant band
at 290 nm, corresponding to an antiparallel tetraplex but
with a shoulder from the shorter wavelength side (Figure 7C).
This held for all longer fragments including G3(TTAG3)11
and G3(TTAG3)15 with the integral multiples of the four G3
blocks. The CD spectrum no longer corresponded to a regular
intramolecular antiparallel tetraplex. Longer fragments obvi-
ously cannot generate a strict intramolecular tetraplex, maybe
also owing to the possibility of the sequence to associate in
both antiparallel and parallel way. Irregularities probably
occur in the tetraplex structures of the long G3(TTAG3)n frag-
ments, which are consistent with the observed decrease in
thermostability with the increasing repeat number (Table 1).
Table 1 also includes DH values calculated from the melting
curves of telomeric fragments which adopt only a single type
of arrangement. Table 1 shows that G3(TTAG3)3 displays the
highest value of DH. The value corresponds to the published
literature data (40,50). The enthalpies then decrease with the
increasing repeat number. The close enthalpy values of the
tetraplexes of G3(TTAG3)3, G3(TTAG3)4 and G3(TTAG3)5
indicate that their tetraplex cores are in principle similar,
being formed by one unit of three guanine tetrads, though
their detailed tetraplex structures are different. The sharp
enthalpy decrease of the G3(TTAG3)7 tetraplex suggests
that its structure is divided into more cooperative units
which melt independently. This may be a consequence of
TTA loops between two triads of guanine tetrads (the lower
sketch in Figure 6), or, more probably, the triads may be
positioned side by side like beads connected by the TTA
sequence (the upper sketch in Figure 6). This alternative
arrangement is supported by the enhanced electrophoretic
mobility of G3(TTAG3)7 tetraplex. A further substantial
decrease of DH observed with longer fragments indicates
that their tetraplex structures are split into more units and/
or contain irregularities. This is consistent with the decreased
thermostabilities of the tetraplexes of the longer fragments.
Simultaneously the gel mobility is decreased, indicating less
compact arrangements of the tetraplexes.
DISCUSSION
The guanine tetraplex is a biologically relevant alternative of
the Watson and Crick duplex of DNA. For example, it occurs
at the ends of chromosomes where it may regulate telomere
metabolism (6,7). Many dozens of papers were written about
telomeres and some of them describe folding of the G-rich
telomere strand into different types of guanine tetraplexes (27–
38). However, many questions still remain open. For example,
how the tetraplex folding depends on the number of DNA
repeats in the telomere? Solution of this problem could
help to understand the problem of telomere shortening,
which accompanies important biological phenomena, such
as aging or cancer (20).
In this paper, we study a DNA set of 20 human telomere
fragments including G3(TTAG3)n, where n ¼ 1–16. The study
was performed at physiological concentrations of potassium
cations using mostly CD spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis.
CD spectroscopy is a very sensitive and reliable indicator
of DNA secondary structure. It is a unique method in its abil-
ity to discriminate between non-cooperative conformational
changes within a single structure and conformational isomer-
izations between distinct structures. The solution conditions
inducing conformational changes can easily be changed

directly in the CD cells, which enables mapping of the whole
conformational space of the studied DNA molecule (47).
We show in this paper that tetraplex conformation, and the
tetraplex topology in particular, depends on the number of
(TTAG3) repeats in the human telomere. The shortest frag-
ment G3TTAG3 coexists in the antiparallel and parallel tet-
raplexes (Figures 1 and 2). The parallel tetraplex was observed
in the crystal of TAG3TTAG3T (34). Temperature influences
the conformational equilibrium in solution while higher tem-
peratures stabilize the parallel tetraplex. Coexistence of anti-
parallel and parallel tetraplexes was also observed with
TAG3TTAG3T in solution by NMR (38).
The 21mer G3(TTAG3)3 contains four G3 blocks and folds
into an intramolecular antiparallel tetraplex at all conditions
tested in this work (Figures 2 and 3). We observed no indica-
tion of its isomerization into the parallel tetraplex adopted by a
related AG3(TTAG3)3 in the crystalline state (34). In addition,
we show here that this 22mer does not generate the parallel
tetraplex in solution, either (Figures 2 and 3).
Surprisingly, extension of G3(TTAG3)3 by one TTAG3
repeat retains the tetraplex intramolecular (Figure 5) but the
CD spectrum indicates an increased population of parallel
tetraplex features (Figure 4). The oligonucleotide does not,
however, adopt a mixture of tetraplex conformers but a single
discrete conformation. We suggest that the extra TTAG3
repeat might be used to generate the side loop observed in
the crystal (34), so that the tetraplex of G3(TTAG3)4 would
contain three parallel strands and one antiparallel strand
(Figure 4). Such a tetraplex was observed by NMR with
G3T4G4 (52). Its CD spectrum is principally the same as in
the case of G3(TTAG3)4 (Figure 4, inset B). The suggested
3 + 1 model fits our observations. However, it is to be noted
that CD spectroscopy does not directly reflect strand orienta-
tion. We have numerous indications (M. Vorlı´cˇkova´, unpub-
lished data) that the population of syn/anti geometries of
guanosine glycosidic torsion angles is what determines the
CD spectral shape of the guanine tetraplexes. The syn/anti
geometry is related to strand orientation but not absolutely.
Similar to G3(TTAG3)3, the 45mer G3(TTAG3)7 generates
only a single stable conformer, i.e. an intramolecular anti-
parallel tetraplex (Figures 5 and 6). The CD spectra of
G3(TTAG3)3 and G3(TTAG3)7 are almost identical. However,
G3(TTAG3)7 is surprisingly less thermostable (Figure 8), and
has a distinctly lower enthalpy (Table 1). It also does not
migrate as fast as G3(TTAG3)3, even though it migrates faster
than it would correspond to a monotonous dependence of Rf as
a function of logarithm of fragment lengths (Figure 5, lower
panel). This suggests that the G3(TTAG3)3 tetraplex has a very
compact globular shape, whereas the tetraplex of G3(TTAG3)7
lacks this exceptionality.
We expected that the 39mer G3(TTAG3)6 would be the
proper candidate to generate a stable parallel intramolecular
tetraplex with three TTAG3 repeats in the side loops. This,
however, was not the case. Apart from a monomolecular tet-
raplex, the 39mer dimerized into a bimolecular tetraplex
(Figure 5). The CD spectrum of the tetraplexes displayed
still increased ellipticity at 290 nm as compared with those
of G3(TTAG3)4 and G3(TTAG3)5, and a compensatory
decrease at 260 nm, which hints at an elevated amount of
structural features characteristic of antiparallel tetraplexes
(Figure 7B). Increasing temperature, however, induced a
slow increase of the 260 nm CD band, indicating a conversion
of the oligonucleotide conformation towards a parallel tet-
raplex. A simultaneous increase in the population of the mono-
molecular fraction in this sample (data not shown) indicated
that the expected intramolecular parallel tetraplex was formed.
The arising tetraplex, however, was rather unstable because
the oligonucleotide melted at relatively very low temperatures
(Figure 8). The 15mer G3(TTAG3)2, containing one redundant
repeat, behaved in a similar way. Increasing temperature also
induced a time-dependent isomerization towards a parallel
tetraplex arrangement. The oligonucleotide formed not only
bimolecular but also tetramolecular tetraplexes (Figure 5). The
bimolecular tetraplex yielded three weak electrophoretic
bands corresponding to three possible positions of the repeat
that was not included in the tetraplex core, i.e. in the middle, or
on the 30 or 50 ends. The population of bimolecular tetraplexes
slightly increased with increasing temperature. G3(TTAG3)2,
however, predominantly formed tetramolecular tetraplexes,
which probably were responsible for a significantly higher
thermostability of the oligonucleotide than was observed
with G3(TTAG3)6 (Figure 8). It is interesting that two types
of tetramolecular tetraplexes were formed by G3(TTAG3)2
(Figure 5). Obviously, even tetramolecular tetraplexes
may associate not only in parallel but also in antiparallel
orientation.
Tetraplexes of human telomere fragments longer than
G3(TTAG3)7 all provided the same CD spectra with a dom-
inant band at 290 nm and a shoulder at 260 nm (Figure 7). In no
case, including G3(TTAG3)11 and G3(TTAG3)15, did the CD
spectra correspond to the pure antiparallel tetraplexes adopted
by G3(TTAG3)3 and G3(TTAG3)7. In addition to the intra-
molecular tetraplex, the 57mer G3(TTAG3)9 also formed
bimolecular tetraplexes (Figure 5). No isomerization, how-
ever, was detected with increasing temperature with this oli-
gonucleotide. All other longer oligonucleotides exclusively
formed intramolecular tetraplexes (Figure 5). The increasing
number of (TTAG3) repeats surprisingly caused thermal
destabilization of their tetraplexes (Figure 8 and Table 1),
a decrease in their DH values and a slower migration in the
gel (Figure 5). A comparison of the migration of telomere
fragments containing 4, 5, 6 and 7 G3 blocks, as well as of
fragments containing 8, 9 and 10 blocks, suggests that the
repeats not included in the tetraplex core slow down the migra-
tion. However, DH values of G3(TTAG3)3, G3(TTAG3)4 and
G3(TTAG3)5 tetraplexes are nearly the same. This indicates

that the fragments generate a single similar tetraplex unit,
consisting of three guanine tetrads, though detailed tetraplex
arrangements are different. The large decrease of DH values
with the tetraplex of G3(TTAG3)7 indicates tetraplex splitting
into more cooperative units, perhaps two beads shown in
Figure 6. The value of DH further decreases with longer
telomeric fragments, which may reflect an increasing number
of cooperative units in the structure. The relatively faster
migration of fragments containing 4, and to a lesser extent
8 and 12 G3 blocks, may support the possibility of their folding
into beads, like in the case of nucleosomes. We will further
study this possibility. In general, longer fragments migrate
more slowly, the longer they are. It seems that increasing
amounts of the (TTAG3) repeats in the fragment increase
the number of available conformations. The presence of vari-
ous loops on the tetraplex sides then probably leads to irregu-
larities in tetraplex arrangements and, consequently, to the
structure destabilization.
The most stable tetraplex is formed by G3(TTAG3)3. Hence
the four G3 blocks in the human telomere repeats, and not the
longer segments, are the most promising candidates for tet-
raplex formation in vivo. Reduced stability and different topo-
logy of lengthy telomeric tails could contribute to the stepwise
telomere shortening process.
