Abstract
p53 is a critical tumor suppressor which removes cells with
DNA damage by regulating expression and activity of a select
group of p53-induced genes (PIG) that subsequently induce
apoptosis. PIG8 was also identified as a gene induced by
etoposide and named etoposide-induced gene 24 (EI24). Later
experiments established EI24/PIG8 as a proapoptotic factor
and suggested that it may function as a tumor suppressor.
Indeed, EI24/PIG8 is relatively highly mutated in aggressive
breast cancers and is located in a region which expresses
frequent loss of heterozygosity. However, despite these impor-
tant observations, the activity and role of EI24/PIG8 remain
largely unknown.We used (immmuno)fluorescencemicroscopy
and subcellular fractionation techniques to show that EI24/
PIG8 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Pull-down
experiments showed that it specifically binds with Bcl-2, a
death regulator known to reside in mitochondria, ER, and the
nuclear envelope. EI24/PIG8-Bcl-2 binding was corroborated
by coimmunoprecipitation and other in vitro and in vivo
protein-protein binding assays. Further analysis showed that
EI24/PIG8 uses its N-terminal region to bind the BH3 domain in
Bcl-2. Finally, we used immunohistochemical techniques to
analyze expression of EI24/PIG8 in breast cancer tissue
progression arrays and showed that loss of EI24/PIG8 is
associated with tumor invasiveness but not with the develop-
ment of the primary tumor. These results suggest that EI24/
PIG8 is a novel, ER-localized Bcl-2–binding protein which may
contribute to apoptosis by modulating the activity and/or
function of Bcl-2 in this organelle. EI24/PIG8 may serve to
prevent tumor spreading, consistent with its suspected role as
a tumor suppressor. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(6): 2125-9)
Introduction
The role of p53 as the ‘‘gatekeeper’’ in the cellular defense against
genotoxic damage and its function as a critical tumor suppressor,
protecting the organism from potentially harmful cells which
incurred DNA damage, are amply documented (1, 2). TP53 is the
most commonly deleted or mutated gene in human cancers (3),
and patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and TP53 knockout mice
have clearly shown that loss of p53 results in a cancer-prone
phenotype (4, 5).
Much effort has therefore been dedicated to the characterization
of p53 target genes because they are the effectors of the apoptotic
p53 response. Using adenoviral-mediated transfection of p53 into
p53-deficient human colorectal cancer cells, which then undergo
apoptosis, 14 p53-induced genes (PIG) were identified which were
strongly induced (6). One of these genes, PIG8 , was also identified
in an unrelated screen for genes that are induced by the
chemotherapeutic drug etoposide and named etoposide-induced
gene 24 (EI24 ; ref. 7). Subsequent studies identified the p53
response element in the murine EI24/PIG8 gene although the
human promoter has not been characterized yet (8). Indeed, the
p53-dependent response of EI24/PIG8 is so robust that it is used
as a biomarker for p53 activation (9, 10).
Ectopic expression of EI24/PIG8 was shown to be necessary and
sufficient for induction of apoptosis (8), and our studies confirmed
a major role for EI24/PIG8 in apoptosis induced by the DNA
adduct-inducing synthetic retinoid CD437/AHPN in melanoma
cells (11). These results suggested that EI24/PIG8 is an important
apoptotic effector of p53 with a potential physiologic role as a
tumor suppressor. This idea was further strengthened by a number
of clinico-genetic studies. EI24/PIG8 was mapped to human
chromosome 11q23-q25 (12), a region which is often deleted in
solid tumors (13). Genetic analysis of 41 early-onset breast cancers
showed that EI24/PIG8 has the highest mutation rate of four
candidate tumor suppressor genes located in this area, with many
of the mutations predicted to result in frameshifts or complete loss
of translation (13). Moreover, this region expresses frequent loss
of heterozygosity, suggesting that EI24/PIG8 is perhaps the most
important tumor suppressor gene at this locus (14).
However, despite these intriguing and promising findings, little
progress has been made on the characterization of EI24/PIG8 and
its activity and function in normal and cancer cells remain largely
unknown. We show here that EI24/PIG8 is a novel, endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)–localized Bcl-2–binding protein. Furthermore,
immunohistochemical analysis showed that loss of EI24/PIG8 is
associated with breast tumor invasiveness. These results suggest
that induction of EI24/PIG8 results in modulation of the activity
and/or function of Bcl-2 in the ER and that this event contributes
to the apoptotic process. EI24/PIG8 may serve to prevent tumor
spreading in breast cancer, consistent with its suspected role as a
tumor suppressor.

instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Etoposide was
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Plasmid Construction. pEI24/PIG8-eGFP was constructed by cloning
the murine cDNA from prKMei-flag (8) with a Kozak translational start site
into the HindIII-SalI sites of pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For
mammalian two-hybrid studies, EI24/PIG8, Bcl-2, and PCR-generated
mutant cDNAs were cloned into the SalI-NotI sites of pBIND and pACT
(Promega, Madison, WI). The same cDNAs were cloned into EcoRI-NotI
sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for in vitro translation. To
generate bacterially expressed proteins, EI24/PIG8 cDNA was cloned into
the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET-16b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and Bcl-2 cDNA
was cloned into pGEX4-T (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
pRed2ER was obtained from Clontech.
Subcellular Fractionation. Cells were collected by trypsin-EDTA
digestion. Whole cell lysates were obtained by lysing cells in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay buffer. To obtain the ER-enriched subcellular
fraction, we essentially used the discontinuous sucrose gradient method as
described before (15, 16) except that smooth and rough ER fractions were
combined. Protein concentrations were determined by Pierce Protein Assay
reagent (Rockford, IL).
Protein-Protein Binding Assays. Generation of recombinant His-EI24/
PIG8 and GST-Bcl-2 protein and affinity columns and binding reactions
were done as described (17). In vitro translation of EI24/PIG8 and Bcl-2
cDNAs was done in T7 TnT rabbit reticulocyte system with [35S]methionine
according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega). Whole 3T3 cell
extract was prepared using E-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction reagent
(Pierce). For mammalian two-hybrid assays, cells were seeded in six-well
plates and transfected with 0.2 Ag pACT, pBIND, and pG5Luc reporter
(Promega). Total amount of plasmid was kept constant by adding empty
pACT or pBIND vector as required. After 24 hours, luciferase assays were
done and normalized as described (17).
Coimmunoprecipitation. pMV12-Bcl-2 Balb cells (18) were transfected
with prKMei-FLAG or pEGFP-N3. Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed
in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1%
NP40, 50 mmol/L NaF, 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for
30 minutes. Supernatants were collected and subjected to immunopreci-
pitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4jC. Complexes
were precipitated by incubation with Protein A-agarose beads analyzed by
Western blot as described (17). Quantitation of bands was done by
densitometry (Labworks4.0, UVP, Upland, CA).
(Immuno)Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy. For confocal
imaging, 3T3 cells were plated in Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc,
Naperville, IL) at 40% confluence after transfection. After 24 hours, cells
were fixed with paraformaldehyde and mounted with ProLong Antifade
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with 0.2 Ag/mL 4V,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole where indicated. Mitochondria in transfected
cells were stained with MitoTracker Red before mounting according to the
protocol of the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Enhanced green
fluorescent protein (eGFP) fluorescence was detected using a FITC filter;
red fluorescent protein fluorescence and MitoTracker Red were detected
with a Rhodamine filter. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown in
chamber slides and transfected where indicated. Cells were fixed in
methanol/acetone (1:1), incubated with anti-EI24/PIG8 antibody (1:100) for
2 hours, followed by incubation with fluorescent-conjugated anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) for 45 minutes,
and examined by fluorescence microscopy.
Immunohistochemical Analysis. Breast cancer progression tissue
arrays were obtained from the Cooperative Breast Cancer Tissue Resource
(National Cancer Institute). Other investigators may have received slides
from these same array blocks. Anti-EI24/PIG8 antibody was raised by
immunization of rabbits with a conserved EI24/PIG8 peptide encoded in
the N terminus (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Serum was affinity-purified
against peptide (Arista Biologicals, Allentown, PA). Antibody specificity was
confirmed by positive staining of EI24/PIG8 expression vector–transfected
cells, compared with negative staining of control-transfected 3T3 cells (data
not shown), and detection of endogenous EI24/PIG8 in etoposide-treated
S91 and 3T3 cells only (see Fig. 1). Immunohistochemical staining was done
according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and
hydrated in graded alcohol series and then incubated with anti-EI24/PIG8
antibody at 1:50 overnight at 4jC. Detection was done by incubation with
biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody and staining with ABC Reagent Kit.
Negative control (rabbit serum) did not give staining (data not shown). Two
observers scored staining of tissue samples as follows: 0% to 25%, 26% to
50%, 51% to 75%, and 76% to 100% positive. Only undamaged samples that
received identical scores by both observers were included in the final
analysis. Furthermore, positive and negative staining of four sets of control
tissue and cell culture samples located in different areas showed that the
entire array surface was evenly stained and that the observers scored
staining in a consistent manner.
Results and Discussion
EI24/PIG8 Targets the Endoplasmic Reticulum. We first
wanted to establish the target organelle(s) of EI24/PIG8 because
this provides information about the site where the death signal is
likely first generated. Basal EI24/PIG8 expression levels in 3T3
fibroblasts were extremely low (data not shown). Therefore, to
enable detection by immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were
treated with sublethal levels of etoposide to increase p53-
dependent EI24/PIG8 expression (7). As shown in Fig. 1A , EI24/
PIG8 is a cytoplasmic protein which seems to be associated with
particular intracellular structures. To identify this subcellular
compartment(s), we used EI24/PIG8-eGFP expression vectors
because this allows detection in both live and fixed cells and
does not require additional etoposide treatment. Transfected

EI24/PIG8-eGFP displayed a similar pattern as endogenous EI24/
PIG8 (Fig. 1A). Appearance of cells with a smaller and apoptotic
morphology was also observed. In contrast, eGFP was evenly
distributed over cytoplasm and nucleus without affecting cell
viability. These effects, therefore, could only have been contri-
buted by the EI24/PIG8 moiety of the fusion protein.
EI24/PIG8 could conceivably be located in the ER and/or
mitochondria, organelles known to be involved in apoptotic
processes (19, 20). To test these possibilities, EI24/PIG8-eGFP
expression vector was cotransfected with a vector which
expresses a red fluorescent protein specifically targeted to the
ER (Red2ER). Our results show that EI24/PIG8-eGFP expression
colocalized with the ER marker but not with a mitochondria-
specific stain (Fig. 1B and C , respectively). To further corroborate
ER targeting of EI24/PIG8, cells were again transfected with
EI24/PIG8-eGFP or eGFP expression vectors, and whole cell
lysates and ER-enriched subcellular fractions were obtained.
Equal amounts of protein were then loaded and separated by
SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-eGFP antibody.
Consistent with our microscopy data, EI24/PIG8-eGFP, but not
control eGFP, was enriched in the ER fraction relative to whole
cell lysate (Fig. 1D). Finally, we transfected etoposide-treated
cells with Red2ER vector followed by immunofluorescent staining
with anti-EI24/PIG8 antibody to detect endogenous protein. As
shown in Fig. 1E , localization of EI24/PIG8 again completely
overlapped with the transfected ER marker. These results
establish EI24/PIG8 as an ER-localized protein, suggesting that
the apoptotic signal is triggered at this organelle when levels of
EI24/PIG8 increase after induction by p53.
EI24/PIG8 Is a Novel Bcl-2–Binding Protein. Many death
regulators are present in the ER where they have important
although poorly understood functions (19–24). For instance, Bcl-2,
best known for its antiapoptotic role in mitochondria, also
interferes with apoptosis induction by Bax, ionizing radiation,
serum withdrawal, and c-Myc expression in the ER (20). As many of
these proteins can form concentration-dependent complexes that
have different activities, we speculated that EI24/PIG8 may also
bind with a cell death factor at this organelle. To test this
hypothesis, we first generated a His-tagged EI24/PIG8-affinity
column which was incubated with cell lysate from 3T3 cells. Bound
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immuno-
blotting with various antibodies, as indicated in Fig. 2A .
Interestingly, Bcl-2, but virtually no Bcl-XL or Bax, was specifically
bound by EI24/PIG8. Bad and Bcl-XS were undetectable (data not
shown). To validate and expand on this observation, we did a
coimmunoprecipitation assay to determine whether endogenous
EI24/PIG8 and Bcl-2 also bind in vivo . S91 melanoma cells, which
express high levels of Bcl-2, were treated with etoposide to induce
EI24/PIG8 (7, 11). Next, cell lysates were incubated with anti-EI24/
PIG8 antibody or immunoglobulin G control, and coimmunopre-
cipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B ,
endogenous Bcl-2 was specifically associated with endogenous
EI24/PIG8 (note that two different Bcl-2 products can be detected
in S91 cells, as described in ref. 25, 26). We also wanted to confirm
this result for exogenous EI24/PIG8 and Bcl-2. FLAG-EI24/PIG8
expression vector was transfected into fibroblasts that stably
overexpress Bcl-2 (12). Whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-
FLAG antibody or immunoglobulin G control, and coimmunopre-
cipitation and immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-2 antibody was done
as before. As shown in Fig. 2C , Bcl-2 was specifically associated
with FLAG-EI24/PIG8 because no Bcl-2 was detected with
immunoglobulin G control and Bcl-2 did not associate with
control eGFP expressed from transfected eGFP expression vector.
Thus, EI24/PIG8 is a novel Bcl-2–binding protein.
Finally, we wanted to know if the amount of etoposide-induced
EI24/PIG8 would be sufficient or insufficient to bind with all ER-
resident Bcl-2, which in lymphoma cells was estimated to reach
20% of total Bcl-2 (25) although lower levels seem to be present
in other cell types (26). S91 cells were again treated with
etoposide, and Bcl-2 expression was determined in control lysate
and lysate depleted of EI24/PIG8 and associated Bcl-2 by
coimmunoprecipitation with anti-EI24/PIG8 antibody. Fig. 2D
shows that depletion of EI24/PIG8 removes 33% of Bcl-2,
suggesting that the amount of induced EI24/PIG8 is sufficient
to bind all available ER-resident Bcl-2.
Mapping of EI24/PIG8-Bcl-2 Binding Domains. To charac-
terize the interaction between EI24/PIG8 and Bcl-2 in more detail,
we assessed binding of 35S-labeled Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 mutants to a
His-EI24/PIG8 affinity column. As shown in Fig. 3A (left), deletion
of residues 78 to 91, 6 to 82 (which includes the BH4 domain),

(1 mg protein) was incubated with His-EI24/PIG8 or control column, and
bound protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.

and exogenous (C ) EI24/PIG8 is associated with Bcl-2. B, S91 cells were
treated for 24 hours with 10 Ag/mL etoposide to induce EI24/PIG8 expression.
Cell lysates were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation with anti-EI24/PIG8
antibody or immunoglobulin G control. Protein complexes were then separated
by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-2 antibody. C,
Bcl-2-overexpressing fibroblasts were transfected with FLAG-EI24/PIG8
expression vector and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG
antibody or immunoglobulin G control, followed by immunoblotting of
complexes with anti-Bcl-2 antibody. Right, Bcl-2 is not associated with
overexpressed eGFP after transfection with eGFP vector, followed by
coimmunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody. D, depletion of EI24/PIG8
from etoposide-treated S91 cell lysate results in 33% loss of Bcl-2, which
exceeds the amount of ER-resident Bcl-2 (25, 26). Cells were etoposide-treated
as above, and Bcl-2 expression in control cell lysate and lysate depleted of
EI24/PIG8 and associated Bcl-2 was determined by coimmunoprecipitation
with anti-EI24/PIG8 antibody and immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-2 antibody
(60 Ag/lane). Bottom, quantitation of bands after densitometry.

and 204 to 239 (which contains the membrane insertion domain)
was dispensable for binding with EI24/PIG8, suggesting that the
critical binding domain resided between residues 92 and 203. This
region contains BH domains 1 to 3 (21), which were then
individually deleted, and binding of BH mutants to EI24/PIG8 was
again tested. As shown in Fig. 3A (right), Bcl-2 mutants missing
BH1 (residues 136-155) or BH2 (residues 187-202) were not
affected. The BH3 mutant, which misses residues 93 to 107, no
longer bound at levels equal to that of a control column ( far
right). In the reciprocal experiment we assessed binding of 35S-
labeled EI24/PIG8 and a series of truncation mutants to a GST-
Bcl-2 affinity column. As shown in Fig. 3B , all C-terminal
deletions and an N-terminal mutant missing residues 1 to 51
still bound. However, further N-terminal deletion of residues 1 to
115 abrogated all binding. These results suggest that the Bcl-
2–binding domain in EI24/PIG8 is located between residues 52
and 115 and that this region binds with the BH3 domain of Bcl-2.
This latter domain constitutes the heterodimerization interface in
the BH3 domain–containing protein families, and thus EI24/PIG8
also seems to use this surface (21, 22).
Finally, we used a mammalian two-hybrid system to test the
functional interactions between Bcl-2 and EI24/PIG8 in vivo . Bcl-2
cDNA was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in vector
pACT, whereas EI24/PIG8 cDNA was cloned in frame with the
VP16 transcriptional activation domain in vector pBIND. Cells
were cotransfected with these and/or empty control vectors
together with a luciferase reporter plasmid, and normalized
luciferase activity (expressed as arbitrary units) was determined.
As shown in Fig. 3C , significant luciferase activity was detected
when Bcl-2 and EI24/PIG8 were coexpressed but not when they
were transfected as single vectors. The N-terminal mutant
missing residues 1 to 51 still interacted with Bcl-2, but further
deletion of the Bcl-2-binding domain resulted to loss of
luciferase activity. These results are consistent with our in vitro
protein-protein binding studies and provide strong evidence that
Bcl-2 and EI24/PIG8 can bind in the ER.
Loss of EI24/PIG8 Is Associated with Breast Tumor
Invasiveness. In the final series of experiments, we wanted to
obtain information about the potential role that loss of EI24/PIG8

plays in breast cancer development, as suggested by earlier
chromosomal studies (8, 9). We analyzed expression of EI24/PIG8
in normal breast tissue, ductal carcinoma in situ , and invasive ductal
adenocarcinoma on breast cancer tissue progression arrays. Each
sample was scored for the fraction of EI24/PIG8-positive cells as
illustrated in representative samples of each tissue type in Fig. 4. The
results are shown for each category and are summarized as low
(0-50%) or high (51-100%) EI24/PIG8 expression. In normal tissue
and ductal carcinoma in situ , 96% and 86% of specimens have high
EI24/PIG8 expression, respectively. However, in invasive cancers
this fraction has dropped to only 38%. Conversely, only 4% of normal
breast tissue and 14% of ductal carcinoma in situ samples are
classified as low in EI24/PIG8 expression whereas this number
increases to 62% in invasive cancers. This statistically significant
reduction of EI24/PIG8 expression in invasive cancers relative to
normal breast tissue and its slightly less reduction in ductal
carcinoma in situ suggest a role for EI24/PIG8 in suppressing tumor
invasiveness. No correlation between loss of EI24/PIG8 and estrogen
or progesterone receptor status or grade of the tumors was observed
(data not shown).
A Model for the Action and Function of EI24/PIG8. Bcl-2 is
not only present in mitochondria but is also found in the nuclear
envelope and ER (25, 26). In the latter organelle, Bcl-2 is involved in
regulating calcium fluxes between ER, cytoplasm, andmitochondria,
which can greatly affect downstream enzyme activities and cell
viability (24). It was recently shown that the ratio of Bcl-2:Bax/Bak,
but not the absolute amount of Bcl-2, is amajor factor in this process
presumably because shifts in concentration control which death
factor complexes are formed, with dramatic consequences (27). Our
data suggest that binding of EI24/PIG8 with Bcl-2, which occurs after
p53-dependent induction of EI24/PIG8 increases its concentration
to relatively high levels compared with the amount of resident Bcl-2,
leads to perturbations in the activity of Bcl-2 which may affect the
entire physiology of the ER. It is conceivable that this event
contributes to the apoptotic EI24/PIG8-dependent signaling cas-
cade which ultimately may involve multiple organelles (28). In
accordance with this interpretation, it was shown that over-
expression of Bcl-XL, which we showed to be incapable of directly
binding with EI24/PIG8, can inhibit EI24/PIG8-dependent apoptosis
in transfected fibroblasts, suggesting that Bcl-XL can functionally
substitute for EI24/PIG8-bound Bcl-2 (8).
Our immunohistochemical analysis suggests that EI24/PIG8
prevents tumor spreading rather than contributes to the
development of the primary tumor, which is consistent with the
suspected tumor suppressor activity of EI24/PIG8 in aggressive
breast cancer. This indicates that EI24/PIG8 may interfere with the
activity of late-stage metastasis genes during mammary carcino-
genesis. Answers to these important new questions, as well as
further assessment of loss of EI24/PIG8 as a prognostic biomarker
for disease progression and perhaps resistance to etoposide and/
or other chemotherapeutics, may result in new insights into the
biology and treatment of this disease.
