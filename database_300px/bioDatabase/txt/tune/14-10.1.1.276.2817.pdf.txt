ABSTRACT
The replacement histone H2A.Z is variously reported
as being linked to gene expression and preventing the
spread of heterochromatin in yeast, or concentrated
at heterochromatin in mammals. To resolve this
apparent dichotomy, affinity-purified antibodies
against the N-terminal region of H2A.Z, in both a tri-
acetylatedandnon-acetylatedstate,areused in native
chromatin immmuno-precipitation experiments with
mononucleosomes from three chicken cell types. The
hyperacetylated species concentrates at the 50 end of
active genes, both tissue specific and housekeeping
but is absent from inactive genes, while the
unacetylated form is absent from both active and
inactive genes. A concentration of H2A.Z is also
found at insulators under circumstances implying a
link to barrier activity but not to enhancer blocking.
Although acetylated H2A.Z is widespread throughout
the interphase genome, at mitosis its acetylation is
erased, the unmodified form remaining. Thus,
although H2A.Z may operate as an epigenetic marker
for active genes, its N-terminal acetylation does not.
INTRODUCTION
The inclusion of histone variants (‘replacement histones’)
substituting for canonical histones may act as epigenetic
information for the transmission of specific chromatin states,
similarly to histone modifications or DNA methylation (1).
The H2A.Z variant has a substantially altered sequence
from canonical H2A and is highly conserved in higher
eukaryotes, including Drosophila, though the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Tetrahymena thermophila sequences are
notably different, including the N-terminal domain. At a
sub-set of genes in S.cerevisiae, H2A.Z (Htz1) fulfils a role
related to the combination of SWI/SNF and SAGA, i.e. the
remodelling of chromatin prior to transcription. This implies
participation in gene activation, and mapping of H2A.Z at
yeast genes showed a preferential location not on the genes
themselves but in adjacent intergenic regions (2). Another
activity of H2A.Z in S.cerevisiae is its link to preventing
the spread of heterochromatin (3), and loss of H2A.Z leads
to partial de-repression of HMR, the silent mating locus (4)
and it is present at and close to yeast telomeres (5). In
T.thermophila, an association with transcription was implied
by the presence of H2A.Z in the transcriptionally active mac-
ronucleus but not in the inactive micronucleus (6). In mice,
lack of H2A.Z is lethal at an early stage of embryogenesis (7)
where it is enriched at pericentric heterochromatin (8), and in
mammalian cell lines H2A.Z forms foci with HP1a at hetero-
chromatic domains (9). These observations imply a structural
role in higher eukaryotes but do not exclude a function in gene
expression. Thus, while the proposed role for H2A.Z in yeast
and protozoa is an involvement in transcription and barrier
activity, in vertebrates participation in the formation of het-
erochromatin has been shown but there is no evidence for a
role in transcription.

covalently attached immunogen peptides (10). SDS–PAGE
and AUT–western analysis of the specificity and effectiveness
of the affinity purified antibodies was carried out as described
previously (11).
Preparation of nucleosomes and their
immunoselection (nChIP)
Micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei, i.e. not crosslinked,
followed by separation on exponential sucrose gradients were
used to prepare ‘native’ nucleosomes from four chicken cell
types: 15-day chicken embryo erythrocytes (15DCE), the
HD37 erythroblast cell line, 10-day chicken brain (10DCB)
tissue and the HD11 macrophage cell line. These were then
immuno-precipitated as described previously (10). Antibody-
Bound nucleosomes were retained on Protein G-agarose beads
for sheep antibodies (H2A.Z and AcH2A.Z) and Protein
A-Sepharose for rabbit antibodies (AcH4, AcH3 and
AcH2B). The purified DNA from the Input, Unbound and
Bound nucleosomes was UV quantified and using chicken
genomic DNA as standard, analysed for sequence content
by quantitative real-time PCR using Taqman probes on an
ABI Prism 7900. The amplicon lengths varied between 68
and 113 bp and the results for each amplicon were expressed
as the ratio B/I (which represents the absolute fold enrichment
achieved by the ChIP) or, where a depletion occurred, as I/B
(which represents the absolute fold depletion), all as described
in ref. (11). Error bars represent standard deviations of
triplicate measurements. Duplicate ChIPs with the anti-
AcH2A.Z antibodies showed the same pattern of enrichments
with a 15–20% variation in the absolute values. All the figures
give data from single ChIPs.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Antibody characterization
A synthetic 16-residue N-terminal peptide from chicken
H2A.Z and also its tri-acetyl counterpart were used to raise
and affinity purify antibodies. First, the SDS–western blots in
Figure 1 show that no histone species other than the H2A
fraction are recognized by either antibody. Figure 1A shows
that anti-H2A.Z (i.e. antibodies to the unmodified protein)
strongly recognizes recombinant H2A.Z, an H2A component
in chicken erythrocyte (CE) histones and weakly a component
in histones from butyrate-treated HeLa cells (HB). The low
signal in HB is a result of most H2A.Z being driven up to
acetylated species by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition.
Figure 1B shows that anti-AcH2A.Z fails to recognize the
recombinant protein, i.e. non-acetylated H2A.Z, but strongly
recognizes an H2A species in the HB histones, in consequence
of butyrate treatment.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the antibodies in ChIP
experiments and provide further characterization, nucle-
osomes from several tissues were used in ChIP experiments
with both antibodies. Figure 1C and D show acetic acid/urea/
Triton (AUT) gels and corresponding western blots comparing
proteins in the antibody-Bound chromatins with those of the
Input and Unbound fractions from 10DCB tissue. For both
antibodies the westerns exhibit only very weak H2A.Z
signals in the Input lanes, emphasising the low levels of
H2A.Z in this tissue. By comparing Bound with Input
lanes, the westerns make clear that enrichment has occurred
of a single H2A.Z species in the case of anti-H2A.Z, while for
anti-AcH2A.Z several acetylated species are enriched in the
Bound. The fastest-migrating H2A.Z species in the Bound lane
of Figure 1D cannot be the unacetylated form since Figure 1B
demonstrates that the anti-AcH2A.Z antibodies do not recog-
nize unmodified H2A.Z (rH2A.Z); it follows that H2A.Z car-
ries several acetyl groups. The Supplementary Data contain
AUT gels/westerns of proteins from ChIPs performed using
nucleosomes from 15DCE and from chicken HD11 cells, a
macrophage line. These also make it clear that only a single
H2A.Z species is enriched in the Bound proteins when the
anti-H2A.Z antibodies are used and three species of AcH2A.Z
when the anti-AcH2A.Z antibodies are used for the ChIPs.
The AUT PAGE–westerns also demonstrate that neither
antibody recognizes the canonical H2A species: this follows
from lack of H2A staining in the I and U lanes. Furthermore,
absence of H2A signal in the HB lane also shows that acet-
ylated forms of H2A are not recognized, nor are acetylated
species of the other core histones. The AUT PAGE–westerns
thus show that both antibodies are effective in ChIP
experiments.
H2A.Z mapping
To decide whether H2A.Z is a feature of active genes in the
chicken, nChIP experiments were performed using nucle-
osomes from HD37 cells, a chicken erythroblast line,
15DCE and 10DCB with both affinity-purified antibodies;
assessment of sequence content was by real-time PCR, and
high-resolution distribution maps were thereby generated.
Table 1 gives the transcriptional status of the genes studied
in the three cell types.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of H2A.Z at the tissue-
specific carbonic anhydrase (CA) gene and at the housekeep-
ing GAPDH and vimentin genes in HD37 cells. A consistent
overall distribution is seen in which AcH2A.Z is abundant at
the promoter proximal and 50 ends of the genes, falling off
substantially in a 30 direction to very low levels. In contrast, for
unacetylated H2A.Z, only depletions are observed with the
sole exception of a very small enrichment (1.3-fold) at the
vimentin promoter. In the case of CA, AcH2A.Z is maximal
650 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site and still
substantial within IntronII, 850 bp beyond the end of the
CpG island. At the shorter GAPDH gene, a significant fall off
is seen 2 kb into the gene at ExonIV, just beyond the end of
the CpG island. Thus, although the location of AcH2A.Z
approximately coincides with that of the CpG islands, there
is no absolute link. Similar results were obtained for these
genes in ChIPs using 15DCE input nucleosomes (data not
shown). AcH2A.Z thus appears to be a feature of active
genes with a concentration at the 50 end, rather like that
found at these genes for acetylated H3 and H4 (10–12) and
di- or tri-methyl K4/H3 (12,13). There is no evidence for the
presence of unacetylated H2A.Z at these active housekeeping
genes.
A recent publication (14) described the distribution of
H2A.Z at the human GAPDH and cMyc genes using xChIP
with an antibody recognizing an epitope in the C-terminal
region of H2A.Z, i.e. blind to its state of acetylation. For
5634 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17
both these genes, substantial levels of H2A.Z were found
immediately upstream of the start site, extending into the
transcribed sequences but falling off before the transcription
termination points. Since this distribution is similar to the
present distributions of AcH2A.Z at housekeeping genes, it
is reasonable to suppose that Farris et al. (14) monitored the
acetylated forms of H2A.Z.
The presence of H2A.Z was also monitored at inactive
genes in both HD37 cells and 15DCE (Figure 2): at the insulin
gene and at both ends of the ovalbumin transcribed region,

very small depletions/enrichments were found with both
antibodies. We conclude that inactive genes carry neither
unacetylated nor acetylated H2A.Z. Thus, although
AcH2A.Z is a characteristic of active genes, it is not, for
example, always present at genes in an unmodified form for
subsequent acetylation on gene activation. Since H2A.Z is
enriched in the pericentric heterochromatin of mouse embryos
(8), the XhoI repeat region of the chicken W-chromosome (15)
was tested. Using HD37 nucleosomes, small depletions were
observed (Figure 2), i.e. the XhoI repeat does not contain
H2A.Z or AcH2A.Z in these cells.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of H2A.Z at the lysozyme
locus in HD37 cells. This short locus includes the Gas41
housekeeping gene, located only 200 bp downstream of the
tissue-specific cLYS gene which is active in macrophages and
oviduct but not in HD37 cells (16). The DNase I hypersens-
itive sites (DHSs) at 6.1, 3.9 and 2.7 kb linked to cLYS
activity are absent in these cells, while the silencer DHS at
2.4 kb is present (17). The distribution of AcH2A.Z at the
active Gas41 gene parallels that at other housekeeping genes:

HD37 cells and 15DCE. B/I values (the ratio of the Bound to the Input signal for
an amplicon) above the unity lines represent ‘fold enrichment’ achieved by the
antibodies. I/B values are plotted below the unity lines when the Bound signal is
less than that of the Input: this ratio represents ‘fold depletion’.

5636 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17
substantial enrichments at the promoter proximal region
(15 315), at the CpG island close to the +3.9 constitutive
DHS between the cLYS and Gas41 genes (15 634) and in
ExonIII (16 246), but by ExonVI (17 244, 2 kb beyond
the promoter) the level has dropped. In contrast, at the pro-
moter of the inactive cLYS gene (11 755), on the gene itself
and at the several upstream cis elements, depletions were
found with both antibodies. The lack of H2A.Z at the cLYS
gene and its upstream elements accords with the observations
at the insulin and ovalbumin genes that inactive genes do not
carry H2A.Z of either form.
The distributions of the hyperacetylated forms of the other
three core histones were determined at the lysozyme locus
(lower panels of Figure 3) using antibodies generated against
hyperacetylated H4, H3 and H2B which recognize the most
highly acetylated forms of these core histones and were pre-
viously used to map these modifications in 15DCE (11,18). It
is seen that at the lysozyme locus in HD37 cells they all have a
similar distribution to that of AcH2A.Z: substantial amounts at
the 50 end of the active Gas41 gene, particularly for AcH4, and
mostly depletions at the cLYS gene, at its promoter and at its
upstream regulatory elements. An exception is the small con-
centration of hyperacetylated H3 in the region of the 2.7 kb
enhancer and a small peak of H4 acetylation at the 2.4 kb
silencer. There is no evidence of any acetylation of the core
histones at the flanking matrix attachments sites. The mapping
of acetylation of all four core histones in Figure 3 demon-
strates a clear division of the chicken lysozyme locus in HD37
cells into the active Gas41 region and the inactive upstream
lysozyme region.
Figure 4 shows distributions of H2A.Z at the b-globin locus
in 15DCE, cells in which the adult (bA) and hatching (bH)
genes are active and the folate receptor (FR) gene is inactive.
In 15DCE, there is a substantial peak of AcH2A.Z at the 50
insulator (HS4) and significant levels throughout the b-globin
locus, with no obvious preference for the active genes as
compared with inactive or intergenic regions. In contrast,
within the adjacent 16 kb of heterochromatin and at the FR
gene, essentially no enrichments are seen. This distribution of
AcH2A.Z is broadly similar to that of acetylated forms of the
other three core histones at the b-globin locus in 15DCE
(10,11,18,19). A significant number of nucleosomes in this
active locus therefore contain hyperacetylated forms of all
four core histones. Levels of unacetylated H2A.Z are low
throughout the b-globin locus, the 16 kb heterochromatin
and at the FR gene in 15DCE cells.
In HD37 cells, where there is no globin expression but the
FR gene is active, there are again substantial amounts of
AcH2A.Z at the 50 insulator (HS4) but very little across the
remainder of the b-globin locus. The FR gene itself carries
high levels of AcH2A.Z, tailing off towards its 30 end, becom-
ing low by Intron4, a distribution similar to that at the Gas41,
CA, GAPDH and vimentin genes in HD37 cells. Unacetylated
H2A.Z is absent from the b-globin locus, the 50 insulator
region and the FR gene. In 10DCB, where both the b-globin
and the FR genes are inactive, again there is a concentration of
AcH2A.Z at the 50 insulator but none within the b-globin
locus, nor at the constitutive 30HS at its 30 end (50 732). Strik-
ingly, however, AcH2A.Z is present upstream of the FR gene,
at 7342 and 7810 the 30-HSA prime element. In contrast, there
is no AcH2A.Z neither at the FR promoter (5986/5613), nor
on the gene itself (3951), the same situation as found at other
silent genes. In HD37 cells, the hyperacetylated forms of the
other three core histones, see lower panels of Figure 4, are
substantially enriched at the active FR gene, similarly to
AcH2A.Z, but at the 50 insulator there are no strong peaks
of H4/H3/H2B acetylation comparable with that observed for
AcH2A.Z.
So what is the role of AcH2A.Z at the 50 insulator and 30-
HSA prime (locations tightly flanking the 16 kb heterochro-
matin) in HD37 and 10DCB cells? In HD37 cells the AcH2A.Z

(15DCE), 10-day chicken brain tissue (10DCB) and HD37 chicken erythro-
blasts. Nomenclature as in Figure 3. B/I values (the ratio of the Bound to the
Input signal for an amplicon) above the unity lines represent ‘fold enrichment’
achieved by the antibodies. I/B values are plotted below the unity lines when the
Bound signal is less than that of the Input: this ratio represents ‘fold depletion’.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17 5637
at 30-HSA prime might be related to FR activity but that is not
the case in 10DCB cells where both the globin and FR genes
are silent. The 50 insulator is known to harbour at least two
activities: enhancer blocking and barrier activity (20). Since
there is no AcH2A.Z at 30HS, the constitutive DHS at the 30
end of the locus that binds CTCF to generate enhancer block-
ing activity (21), AcH2A.Z cannot be a feature of this activity.
AcH2A.Z could, however, be associated with a barrier activity
of the 50 insulator and 30-HSA prime, i.e. to stop spreading of
the 16 kb heterochromatin in both directions. If this is a func-
tion of AcH2A.Z, the absence of AcH2A.Z from 30HS is
expected since there is an immediately adjacent olfactory
receptor gene [COR30 (22)] and no heterochromatin blocking
is required. It is worth noting that at 30-HSA prime in 10DCB,
there is neither H3 acetylation, nor H3/K4 methylation (activ-
ating modifications) nor H3/K9 methylation (a repressive
modification) (23), so the presence of AcH2A.Z is exceptional
for this location. If the presence of AcH2A.Z marks a barrier
activity, then its absence from 30-HSA prime in 15DCE is
unexpected; however, it has been postulated (24) on the
basis of increased DNA methylation in the region of 30-
HSA prime that the heterochromatin spreads across the FR
gene in erythrocytes, i.e. no barrier activity is expressed in
these cells. A search for co-factors of human CTCF (25), a
protein linked to enhancer blocking activity, identified H2A.Z
(among others); although this might correspond to the pres-
ence of AcH2A.Z at the 50 insulator, the CTCF site at 30HS
(50 732) is clearly not associated with AcH2A.Z, nor are the
potential CTCF sites just upstream of the FR gene, (located at
5986, at least 1 kb from the points at which AcH2A.Z is found
in 10DCB). An obligatory association of H2A.Z with CTCF
does not therefore appear to be the case. A concentration
of AcH2A.Z at sites immediately flanking the 16 kb
heterochromatin in HD37 and 10DCB might be a correlate
of the finding in yeast that H2A.Z is involved in preventing the
spread of telomeric heterochromatin (3) and in mammalian
cells is enriched at pericentric heterochromatin (8).
Figure 4 also shows distributions at the b-globin locus of the
hyperacetylated forms of the other three core histones in
HD37’s, a cell more developed than HD24’s but at an earlier
developmental stage than 6C2 cells (19). Correspondingly, the
FR gene shows high levels of core histone acetylation at its
promoter, HSA and at 30-HSA prime, falling to a low level by
IntronIV (3951), distributions similar to that of AcH2A.Z. No
enrichments are seen within the 16 kb heterochromatin. Within
the inactive b-globin locus itself, only for AcH4 are modest
enrichments seen: at HS4, HS3, HS2 and at the bA-promoter.
By comparing with the FR gene it is clear that at the 50 insu-
lator the acetylation of H2A.Z dominates that of the other three
core histones.
Since the mapping experiments suggest that active genes
carry AcH2A.Z at their 50 ends, immuno-staining at interphase
should display intensity throughout nuclei. Figure 5 shows this
to be the case in mouse L929 cells when three different anti-
bodies are used: the two used here for the ChIP experiments,
H2A.Z(N0) and AcH2A.Z, both raised to the N-terminal tail,
and an antibody raised to a C-terminal epitope, H2A.Z(C0),
that is independent of the state of acetylation (8). At metaphase
(M), condensed chromosomes are visualized with both the
H2A.Z(N0) and H2A.Z(C0) antibodies, with significant deple-
tions at centromeric heterochromatin, demonstrating that
substantial amounts of H2A.Z remain at metaphase. In con-
trast, when the AcH2A.Z antibodies are used for staining at M,
the condensed chromosomes are invisible, i.e. the acetylation
is completely erased.
CONCLUSIONS
The data show that in chickens, H2A.Z is present at active
genes, moreover in a hyperacetylated form but absent from
inactive genes. The link between gene activity and the pres-
ence of H2A.Z found in S.cerevisiae (2) is now established
for acetylated H2A.Z in a vertebrate. Similar data recently
obtained at two housekeeping genes in human HL60 cells
(14) using antibodies insensitive to the state of H2A.Z acet-
ylation suggest that these conclusions may also apply to
mammalian cells.
The presence of AcH2A.Z at sites flanking the 16 kb of
heterochromatin at the b-globin locus suggests a link to barrier
activity. The acetylated form of H2A.Z could occur in nuc-
leosomes either because a HAT acetylates pre-exchanged
H2A.Z or exchange occurs using already acetylated H2A.Z.
The human equivalent of the S.cerevisiae NuA4 complex
(26,27) contains the expected yeast homologues but also sub-
units homologous to those in the S.cerevisiae SWR1 complex
known to incorporate H2A.Z into nucleosomes (5,28,29). The
larger human complex thus appears to combine the H4/H2A
HAT activities of NuA4 with the remodelling and H2A.Z
exchange capabilities of SWR1 (30), so that H2A.Z could
be deposited into nucleosomes in an acetylated form (31);
this would be consistent with the widespread lack of
unacetylated H2A.Z.

bodies: H2A.Z(N0) and AcH2A.Z raised to the N-terminal tail of H2A.Z (the

epitope, H2A.Z(C0).
