ABSTRACT
In trans-translation transfer messenger RNA (tmRNA)
and small protein B (SmpB) rescue ribosomes stalled
on truncated or in other ways problematic mRNAs.
SmpBpromotes thebindingof tmRNAtotheribosome
but there is uncertainty about the number of particip-
ating SmpB molecules as well as their ribosomal loca-
tion. Here, the interaction of SmpB with ribosomal
subunits and ribosomes was studied by isolation of
SmpB containing complexes followed by chemical
modification of ribosomal RNA with dimethyl sulfate,
kethoxal and hydroxyl radicals. The results show that
SmpB binds 30S and 50S subunits with 1:1 molar
ratios and the 70S ribosome with 2:1 molar ratio.
SmpB-footprints are similar on subunits and the ribo-
some. In the 30S subunit, SmpB footprints nucle-
otides that are in the vicinity of the P-site facing the
E-site, and in the 50S subunit SmpB footprints nucleo-
tides that are located below the L7/L12 stalk in the 3D
structure of the ribosome. Based on these results, we
suggest a mechanism where two molecules of SmpB
interact with tmRNA and the ribosome during trans-
translation. The first SmpB molecule binds near the
factor-binding site on the 50S subunit helping
tmRNA accommodation on the ribosome, whereas
the second SmpB molecule may functionally
substitute for a missing anticodon stem–loop in
tmRNA during later steps of trans-translation.
INTRODUCTION
Translation of the genetic information from nucleotide
sequences (mRNAs) to amino acid sequences (proteins) takes
place on the ribosome—a large ribonucleoprotein complex
that consists of two subunits with distinct functions. Bacterial
ribosomes (70S) are composed of a small (30S) subunit,
containing 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 20 ribosomal
proteins (r-proteins), and a large (50S) subunit, which contains
23S rRNA, 5S rRNA and more than 30 proteins (1).
Each subunit has three tRNA-binding sites (2): the A (ami-
noacyl) site, where the incoming aminoacylated tRNA binds;
the P (peptidyl) site, where the tRNA with the nascent peptide
chain is bound after translocation; and the E (exit) site, from
where the deacylated tRNA leaves the ribosome. The molecular
interactions of A-, P- and E- site bound tRNAs with the 70S
ribosome are revealed in the 3D structure of the mRNA pro-
grammed 70S ribosome in complex with tRNAs (1,3). During
normal translation, aminoacylated tRNAs are delivered to the
decoding centre (DC) in the A-site of the small ribosomal
subunit in complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). EF-
Tu binds, similar to other auxiliary GTPase factors in protein
synthesis, to the factor-binding site close to the GTPase-
activating centre (GAC) of the large subunit. The peptidyl
transferase centre in the large ribosomal subunit catalyses
peptide-bond formation between the peptide in the P-site and
the amino acid in the A-site and then elongation factor G pro-
motes the translocation of the newly formed peptidyl tRNA
from the A- to the P-site resulting in an empty A-site, a peptidyl
tRNA in the P-site and a deacylated tRNA in the E-site. The
newly synthesized proteins are released when the ribosome
reaches a stop codon on the mRNA [reviewed in (4)].
During trans-translation (5,6), a hybrid transfer-messenger
RNA (tmRNA) molecule and its helper protein SmpB (small
protein B) rescue ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNAs lack-
ing stop codons. tmRNA possesses a tRNA-like domain (TLD),
which is aminoacylated with alanine (7,8) and an mRNA-like
domain, containing an internal open reading frame (ORF) (9)
encoding a proteolysis tag (10). tmRNA, charged with alanine
and in complex with EF-Tu (11–13) and SmpB (12,14,15),
binds to the empty A-site of a stalled ribosome. The nascent
polypeptide on the P-site tRNA of the ribosome is then trans-
ferred to the Ala-tmRNA and trans-translation resumes on the
internal ORF of tmRNA (10). Eventually, a protein marked for
degradation (16) is released, allowing the ribosome to recycle
back to a new round of initiation (17).

SmpB is the only known protein co-factor of tmRNA, which
is essential for trans-translation (14,18). It is a small protein
with a globular b-barrel domain and a basic C-terminal tail
similar to that of ribosomal protein S17 (19,20). The b-barrel
domain has an extended oligonucleotide-binding (OB) fold
with basic residues concentrated to opposing surfaces (19).
It has been suggested that SmpB uses those surfaces to interact
simultaneously with tmRNA and 16S rRNA serving as a
bridge between them (21). It has been shown that although
a tail-truncated SmpB binds both to the ribosome and to
tmRNA with high affinity, it cannot support trans-translation
(21). As discussed below, the C-terminal tail of SmpB is
suggested to assist in Ala-tmRNA accommodation into the
70S A-site by extending into the DC and mimicking a
missing codon–anticodon interaction between tmRNA and
the ribosome (21,22).
A high-resolution crystal structure of a complex containing
SmpB and the TLD of tmRNA from Aquifex aeolicus (22)
reveals that one side of the OB fold in SmpB binds to the
elbow region of the TLD and stabilizes its D-loop in an exten-
ded conformation. The C-terminal tail of SmpB is disordered
and cannot be traced in the crystal structure (22). Cross-linking
to and footprinting on tmRNA by SmpB [(12,23); N. Ivanova,
M. Lindell, M. Pavlov, L. Holmberg Schiavone, E.G.H. Wagner
and M. Ehrenberg, manuscript in preparation] confirm that
SmpB interacts with the D- and connector-loops of the TLD.
In the cell SmpB is predominantly ribosome-bound, inde-
pendently of the presence of tmRNA, suggesting that SmpB
could be associated with ribosomes at other times than during
trans-translation (21,24). Existing data indicate that SmpB may
be in complex with tmRNA during the entire trans-translation
cycle on the ribosome [(25); N. Ivanova, M. Lindell, M. Pavlov,
L. Holmberg Schiavone, E.G.H. Wagner and M. Ehrenberg,
manuscript in preparation], but it is still uncertain how many
copies of SmpB bind to the ribosome and tmRNA during trans-
translation. The cryo-EM structure of the kirromycin-stalled
tmRNASmpBEF-Turibosome complex only shows one
molecule of SmpB (15), whereas biochemical studies indicate
that ribosomes (24) and tmRNA (23,26) can bind two and three
SmpB molecules, respectively.
The cryo-EM structure suggests that SmpB interacts prim-
arily with the 50S subunit, whereas tmRNA interacts with the
GAC of the 50S subunit and the DC of the 30S subunit (15). At
the same time, modelling of the SmpBTLD crystal structure
into the map of the 70S ribosome suggests that SmpB is ori-
ented towards the DC of the small ribosomal subunit (22). To
reconcile these two structural models, it has been suggested
that SmpB re-orients during the accommodation of tmRNA
into the ribosomal A-site (22). In this model, SmpB would first
bind to the factor-binding site of the 50S subunit as seen in the
cryo-EM structure. Then, upon accommodation of tmRNA
into the ribosomal A-site, SmpB would be reoriented to the
DC of the small ribosomal subunit and use its C-terminal tail
to substitute for the lack of anticodon stem–loop (ASL) in
tmRNA (15,21,22,25). It has also been proposed that SmpB
should dissociate from tmRNA at later stages of trans-trans-
lation upon peptidyl-tmRNA translocation to the P-site of the
ribosome to make room for the entry of a native aminoacyl-
tRNA into the A-site (22).
The absence of consensus regarding the mode of the inter-
action between SmpB and the ribosome prompted us to
characterize interactions of free SmpB with ribosomal sub-
units and ribosomes. To this end, SmpB containing ribosomal
complexes isolated by gel-filtration were probed by chemical
modification and hydroxyl radical cleavage of ribosomal
RNA. The results show that 70S ribosomes contain two
binding sites for SmpB, one close to the P-site of the small
subunit and one near the factor-binding site of the large sub-
unit. This observation suggests that two different SmpB
molecules participate in trans-translation. Comparison of
SmpB-footprints with the known position of SmpB on the
50S subunit (15) and with interaction sites of P- and E-site
tRNAs in 16S rRNA (1) sheds new light on the function of
SmpB in trans-translation.

Ribosomes and ribosomal subunits
Tight couple 70S ribosomes and ribosomal subunits were pre-
pared from the E.coli wild-type MRE 600 strain using sucrose
gradient zonal ultracentrifugation following the procedure
described previously (34) with the following modifications.
Crude ribosomes were isolated, washed twice with 0.5 M
NH4Cl, pelleted (34) and dissolved in buffer C containing
[20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mM NH4Cl, 5.25 mM Mg(OAc)2,
0.25 mM EDTA and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol]. To obtain 70S
tight couples, the washed ribosomes were further purified by
zonal centrifugation in a Beckman Ti 15 rotor equipped with
reo-grad core (Beckman Coulter). The rotor was loaded by
pumping 200 ml buffer C (overlay), followed by 40 ml of
ribosomal solution in buffer C from the previous step. After
this, 1.1 litre of a convex exponential gradient from 10 to 37%
sucrose in buffer C was loaded into the rotor followed by
100 ml of 50% sucrose cushion in buffer C. After centrifuga-
tion at 4C for 9 h at 32 000 r.p.m. in the Optima 100 K
Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) the reo-grad rotor was
unloaded, 10 ml fractions were collected and the fractions
containing 70S ribosomes (tight couples) were identified by
absorbance at 260 nm and pooled. Pooled 70S tight couples
were recovered by pelleting in a Ti 50.2 rotor (Beckman Coul-
ter) for 30 h at 45 000 r.p.m. Pelleted 70S tight couples were
dissolved in polymix buffer, aliquoted in Eppendorf tubes,
shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80C. The
activity of the tight couple ribosomes in the fMet-Phe dipept-
ide formation assay was at least 80% (see Results).
To prepare ribosomal subunits, the pelleted 70S tight
couples were dissolved in buffer S containing [20 mM Tris,
pH 7.5, 300 mM NH4Cl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA and
3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol] to which 5% sucrose was added.
The Ti 15 rotor with reo-grad core was loaded in the same
way as described above but the overlay contained buffer S and
1.1 litre of a convex exponential 7.5–34% sucrose gradient in
buffer S was loaded. Centrifugation was again at 4C for 9 h at
32 000 r.p.m. After unloading the rotor, the 50S and 30S peaks
were identified by UV, 50S and 30S fractions were pooled
separately and recovered by pelleting in a Ti 50.2 rotor for 36 h
at 45 000 r.p.m. Pellets were dissolved in polymix buffer,
aliquoted in Eppendorf tubes, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at 80C.
Formation of SmpB containing ribosomal complexes
SmpB containing complexes were formed by incubating
SmpB (100–200 pmol) with ribosomal subunits or ribosomes
(40 pmol) in TMK-buffer containing [5 mM Mg(OAc)2,
50 mM KOAc and 50 mM Tris–OAc, pH 7.6] in a final volume
of 80 ml for 5 min at 37C. Control samples, without SmpB,
were incubated in parallel. Samples were left on ice for 10 min
after the incubation.
Stoichiometry of SmpB binding to 70S ribosomes and
ribosomal subunits
Stoichiometry of SmpB binding to subunits and ribosomes was
estimated in gel-filtration experiments using a 60 ml Sephacryl
S300 column (1.6 cm internal diameter and 30 cm length)
equilibrated with TMK or polymix buffer containing [5 mM
Mg(Oac)2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM NH4Cl, 95 mM KCl, 8 mM
putrescine, 1 mM spermidine, 5 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.3) and 1 mM dithioerythritol (35)]. Complexes were
formed as described above using 400 pmol subunits or
ribosomes and 1000 pmol [35S]labelled SmpB in a final vol-
ume of 0.5 ml of TMK or polymix buffer. Samples were eluted
at 1.2 ml/min and 1.2 ml fractions were collected. The amount
of SmpB in the fractions was measured by scintillation count-
ing and the concentration of ribosomes was determined from
UV measured at 260 nm. In some experiments, 1000 pmol of
tRNAPhe or bulk tRNA from E.coli was included to check the
specificity of tmRNA binding to ribosomes.
Chemical modification with DMS and kethoxal
Free ribosomes or ribosomal subunits and SmpB containing
complexes were modified with DMS (final concentration
25 mM) or kethoxal (final concentration 18 mM) for 5 min
at 37C in TMK buffer. Both the DMS and the kethoxal were
diluted in ethanol before use. Control samples lacking modi-
fying reagent were incubated in parallel. The kethoxal-adduct
was stabilized with 25 mM K-borate (pH 7.0) at all times.
Reactions were stopped by EtOH precipitation as described
previously (32).
Generation of hydroxyl radicals
Hydroxyl radicals were generated as described previously
(36). Briefly, 1 ml of a solution containing 200 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0) and 100 mM ammonium iron (II) sulfate was added to
the side of an eppendorf tube, containing ribosomal complex
or free ribosomes. One ml of a solution consisting of 0.25 M
ascorbate and 2.5% H2O2 was added to another side of the tube
and the samples were mixed by brief spinning in an eppendorf
centrifuge at 4C. The samples were kept on ice for 10 min and
then the reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 vol of
0.1 M thiourea.
RNA extraction, primer extension analysis and
evaluation of data
RNA was extracted from protein as described previously (32).
The positions of the modified sites were identified by primer
extension as described previously (37). The primer extension
products were analyzed on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequen-
cing gels in an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer, using
an internal size standard, as described previously (37,38). At
least three independent modification experiments were per-
formed and analyzed before the data were evaluated. We
cannot distinguish between a direct interaction of SmpB
with a section of rRNA and conformational changes induced
by the interaction of SmpB with the subunit/ribosome by the
footprinting technique. However, based on the mapping of
SmpB-footprinted nucleotides on the 3D models of 16S
rRNA and 23S rRNA [1PNS and 1PNU PDB files (3)], we
infer that several footprints are the result of a direct interaction
of SmpB with rRNA (see Results).
Dipeptide formation assay
All experiments were carried out in polymix buffer. Two
mixes were prepared. The ribosomal mix contained 2.5 mM
70S ribosomes (2 mM active), 4 mM [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet,
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 11 3531
4 mM mRNA coding for MFTI tetrapeptide (39), 2 mM each
IF1, IF2 and IF3, 1 mM GTP and 4 mM SmpB when specified.
The factor mix for the cognate reaction contained 2 mM
tRNAPhe, 2 mM EF-Tu, 0.2 mM EF-Ts, PheRS (0.5 U/ml),
400 mM phenylalanine, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM PEP, 1 mM
GTP, PK (2 mg/ml) and MK (0.2 mg/ml). The factor mix
for the near cognate reaction contained 20 mM RNALeuGAG,
20 mM EF-Tu, 2 mM EF-Ts, LeuRS (0.5 U/ml), 400 mM leu-
cine, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM PEP, 1 mM GTP, PK (2 mg/ml) and
MK (0.2 mg/ml). Both the ribosome and the factor mixes were
pre-incubated for 10 min at 37C, mixed in equal volumes,
incubated for varying times and quenched by formic acid to a
final concentration of 17%. The cognate reaction was carried
out with a quench-flow instrument (Chemical-Quench-Flow
ModelQF-3, KinTek Corp.). Dipeptide formation was quan-
tified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
with on-line radio-detection (bRAM3; INUS Inc., USA)
from the ratio of the area of the [3H]fMet-Phe (or
[3H]fMet-Leu) dipeptide peak and the sum of the areas
of the dipeptide and [3H]fMet peaks. Samples for the HPLC
were prepared and processed as described previously (39).
RESULTS
Here, we have searched for possible interaction sites between
the ribosome-associated protein SmpB and ribosomal RNA
by chemical modification and subsequent primer extension
analysis of SmpB containing or SmpB-free ribosomes and
ribosomal subunits.
Binding of SmpB to 30S, 50S and 70S particles
Ribosomal complexes containing SmpB were formed by
incubating ribosomes or ribosomal subunits with 2.5- or 5-
fold excess of SmpB over ribosomes/subunits in TMK buffer
containing 5 mM Mg(OAc)2. The resulting complexes were
purified from unbound protein by gel-filtration chromato-
graphy on a Sephacryl S-300 column. Figure 1 shows the
elution profile of the complexes formed between [35S]labelled
SmpB and either 30S, 50S or 70S particles. The results in
Figure 1A clearly show that the 70S ribosome could accom-
modate two molecules of SmpB in agreement with earlier
data (24).
The 30S and 50S subunit bound 0.8 and 0.6 molar equival-
ents of SmpB, respectively (Figure 1B and C). From the elu-
tion profiles, it is also apparent that SmpB was present in small
amounts in all fractions following the major elution peak
containing 30S, 50S or 70S ribosomes. This indicates continu-
ous dissociation of SmpB from complexes while they moved
through the gel-filtration column. The amount of dissociated
SmpB was significantly larger for 50SSmpB than for 30S
SmpB complexes and was very small for the 70SSmpB com-
plex, indicating tighter SmpB binding to the 70S ribosome
than to the ribosomal subunits. From these experiments, we
concluded that SmpB bound both to the 30S and 50S subunits
in a 1:1 molar ratio and to 70S ribosomes in a 2:1 molar ratio.
The results shown in Figure 1 were reproducible in different
buffer systems, including polymix buffer and the TMK buffer
used in the chemical modification experiments. Moreover, the
addition of pure tRNAPhe or bulk tRNA from E.coli in a 2–5
molar excess over ribosomes or subunits before the application
of the SmpB containing complexes to the column did not
affect the stoichiometry of SmpB in the complexes after elu-
tion from the column (data not shown). This observation
shows that SmpB binding to 70S ribosomes and to subunits
was specific.
Figure 1. Elution profile of SmpB in complex with 70S ribosomes (A) and
SmpB in complex with 30S (B) or 50S (C) ribosomal subunits. Complexes were
prepared by mixing 2.5–5 molar excess of SmpB with 70S ribosomes or sub-
units and loaded onto the Sephacryl S300 gel filtration column. Concentrations
of ribosomes and subunits (blue line) in the fractions were determined from UV
at 260 nm, while the concentration of [35S]labelled SmpB (red line) was
determined by scintillation counting. Free SmpB elutes around fraction 24 from
this column.

Footprinting of ribosomal RNA
Ribosomal RNA in SmpB containing complexes or in free
subunits/ribosomes was modified with DMS or kethoxal or
cleaved with hydroxyl radicals generated from Fe(II)–
EDTA. The single-strand specific reagent DMS modifies
unpaired As at the N-1 position and unpaired Cs at the N-3
position, whereas kethoxal modifies unpaired Gs at the N-1 or
N-2 positions (36). Free hydroxyl radicals are not base-specific
but instead induce strand scissions in the sugar–phosphate
backbone (36). The modified or cleaved nucleotides were
identified by primer extension and gel electrophoresis using
an ABI 377 sequencer.
All of 23S, 5S and 16S rRNA, except their 30 ends, were
analysed and the modification patterns of rRNA in SmpB-
containing complexes were compared with those in SmpB-
lacking complexes. The results show that SmpB protected
bases/the sugar–phosphate backbone in specific regions in
16S rRNA, located to its central and 30-major domains. In
23S rRNA, the backbone was protected in defined regions
of domains II, V and VI. The results are summarized in the
proposed secondary structure models of 16S and 23S rRNA
(Figure 2A and B). The reactivity of nucleotides was affected
to a different extent by the binding of SmpB to ribosomes or
subunits.
In general, the presence of SmpB reduced the reactivity of
bases or the phosphate backbone by 30–70%. The reduction
was stronger in 16S than in 23S rRNA, as to be expected from
the higher affinity of SmpB for the 30S than for the 50S
subunit (Figure 1).
Footprinting of 16S rRNA in 30S subunits and
70S ribosomes
SmpB footprinted nucleotides in the central (Figure 3A–C)
and 30-major (Figure 3D and E) domains in the 16S rRNA. The
strongest hydroxyl radical footprints are seen in the 790-loop
and connecting helix H24 in the backbones surrounding posi-
tions 776–778, 784–787, 790–795, 798–802 and 807–809
(Figure 3A). The largest reduction in reactivity (by 70%)
by the association of SmpB to the 30S subunit is seen for
positions 785–787. Moreover, in the loop, G791 was protected
from kethoxal modification (Figure 3B), whereas A790, A794
and C795 were weakly protected from DMS modification by
the formation of SmpB30S complexes (Figure 3C). Another
position in the central domain that was affected in the com-
plexes was G693 in the 690-loop (Figure 3B). Two peaks were
seen in this region of the fluorogram, probably due to stuttering
of the reverse transcriptase at G693 since the adjacent base is a
uracil that should not be accessible for kethoxal modification.
In the linker region (helix H27) between the central and 30-
major domains, bulging nt G926 and G927 were protected
from kethoxal modification (Figure 3D). G927 base pairs
with U1390 but this does not exclude modification at the
N-2 position by kethoxal. The backbone connecting helices
H30 and H31 (positions 954–959) was protected from cleav-
age by the free hydroxyl radicals in the SmpB30S complex
(Figure 3E). Finally, the N-3 position of C1400 in the 30-minor
domain of 16S rRNA became more exposed to DMS modi-
fication within the SmpB-containing complex (Figure 3F).
No additional footprints were seen in 16S rRNA in 70S
ribosomes. Instead, the reactivity of several nucleotides
decreased or disappeared as a result of the interaction of
the 50S subunit with the 30S subunit. Thus, the hydroxyl
radical cleavages in H24 and its apical 790-loop were abol-
ished by the association of subunits into ribosomes [data not
shown; (1,40)]. Moreover, the DMS- and kethoxal-
reactivity of A790 and G791, respectively, in the 790-loop
disappeared upon the formation of 70S ribosomes (Figure 3B)
(1,40), whereas the DMS-reactivity of A794 and C795 was
less affected. These 2 nt were footprinted by the association of
SmpB with the 70S ribosome (Figure 3C).
Also, hydroxyl radical cleavages in the backbone surround-
ing positions 954–959 in the 30S subunit disappeared upon
70S formation. Nucleotides 954–959 do not contact the 50S
subunit in the crystal structure of the 70S ribosome (1), sug-
gesting that their loss of reactivity was due to a conformational
change of the 30S subunit.
The SmpB-footprints in the 690-loop, at G693 (Figure 3B)
and at positions G926 and G927 in helix H27 (Figure 3D),
were similar in the 70S ribosome and the 30S subunit. More-
over, the reactivity of C1400 was also increased in the
SmpB70S complex compared with ribosomes lacking
SmpB (Figure 3F).
Footprinting of 23S rRNA in 50S and 70S particles
We failed to find any base-specific footprints in 23S rRNA in
the 50S subunit even at a 5-fold molar excess of SmpB over
ribosomes. Instead, the phosphate backbone was protected
in three regions from hydroxyl radical cleavage by SmpB
(Figure 2B). The reactivity was reduced by 30–50% in the
SmpB50S complex compared with the empty subunit. In
helix H89 and its apical loop in domain V, the backbone
around positions 2470–2474 was protected from cleavage
when SmpB was bound to the 50S subunit (Figure 4A).
The footprint was centred on nt U2473 in the 2475-loop.
The second protected region was the a-sarcin/ricin-loop in
domain VI, positions 2655–2656 and 2661–2664 (Figure 4B).
Here, the backbone surrounding U2656 was most strongly
affected. Finally, the backbone surrounding nt U1065–
A1067, A1073–C1075 in the apical loop of helix H43 and
A1095 in the apical loop of helix H44 of domain II was less
accessible to the hydroxyl radicals when SmpB was present
(Figure 4C). In this case, the footprint was centred on nt A1067.
SmpB-footprints were slightly stronger in the 1070- and
1095-regions in the 70S ribosome compared to in the 50S
subunit (Figure 4C). The accessibility of the 2475-loop was
reduced in the 70S ribosome compared with the 50S subunit
but the SmpB-footprint was similar (Figure 4A). In contrast,
the SmpB-footprint in the a-sarcin/ricin-loop was missing in
the SmpB70S complex (Figure 4B).
Mapping of the footprints to the molecular
models of 16S and 23S rRNA
The SmpB-footprints were mapped to the 3D structures of 16S
and 23S rRNA from the E.coli ribosome (3). The footprinted
nucleotides in 16S rRNA in the 690- and 790-loops, in helix
H24, in the linker region between the central and 30-major
domains (helix H27) and in the single-strand region connect-
ing helices H30 and H31 are located to the platform and the
neck region of the 30S subunit (Figure 5A). Interestingly, the
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 11 3533
SmpB-footprints on helix H24 form a continuous surface on
its solvent-exposed side, indicating a strong binding site of
SmpB on the free 30S subunit in this region of 16S rRNA. The
SmpB protection of nt 954–959, linking helices H30–H31, is
too far away from the footprint on helix H24, to be
explained by a direct contact with the same molecule of
SmpB. Instead, SmpB binding may induce conformational
changes in the 30S subunit that lead to the protection of the

phosphate-backbone in the 954–959 region of 16S rRNA.
Alternatively a second, partially filled SmpB-binding site is
lost upon the formation of 70S ribosomes.
When the SmpB-footprints are compared with tRNA inter-
action sites in the 70S ribosome (1,3) almost all footprints
on the 30S subunit are in the vicinity of the P-site facing
the E-site (Figure 5A). The only exception is the exposed nt
C1400 that is in the middle of the P-site. This is clearly shown
in Figure 5A, where the A-site tRNA is yellow and the view is
along the AC stem into the decoding cleft. The data thus
suggest that SmpB binds in the vicinity of the P-site of the
empty 30S subunit.
In 23S rRNA, the SmpB-footprinted nucleotides in the
1070-, 1095-, 2470- and 2660-regions (Figure 5B) are located
below the L7/L12-stalk of the 50S subunit (3). It is evident that
the protected nucleotides in the 1070- and 1095-regions are
situated very close to the protected nucleotides in the apical
loop of helix H89. Moreover, the sugar–phosphate backbone
of the footprinted nucleotides forms a continuous patch on the
solvent-accessible surface of 23S rRNA. It remains protected
by SmpB not only in the free 50S subunit but also in the 70S
ribosome, suggesting that there is a binding site of SmpB in
this area of the 50S subunit. The footprint on the a-sarcin/
ricin-loop is clearly separated from the other footprints in the

Methods and cleaved with hydroxyl radicals (A and E) or modified with kethoxal (B and D) or DMS (C and F). Control samples (black lines) without added modifying
reagent were run in parallel.

3D structure (Figure 5B), but may all the same come from a
direct interaction of SmpB, since the distance between the two
regions is <20 s (3).
To find out whether the footprints in the 70S ribosome were
the result of the interaction of one or more molecules of SmpB
with the ribosome, the distances between footprinted nucle-
otides in the two subunits were measured. The two closest
regions, footprinted in the 70S ribosome, are the 790-loop
in 16S rRNA and helix H89 in 23S rRNA, and these are
>70 s apart in the crystal structure of the 70S ribosome (3).
Therefore, the footprinting results suggest two different
binding sites for SmpB on the 70S ribosome that may be
occupied by two molecules of SmpB during trans-translation.
Effect of SmpB on translational accuracy
Finally, we tested whether the presence of SmpB on a 70S
ribosome affects the accuracy of codon reading. For this, the

complex with EF-Tu and GTP to initiated ribosomes pro-
grammed with the UUU codon in the A-site were determined.
The ribosome activity was in each case checked by quanti-
fication of the amount of fMet-Phe dipeptide formed per
ribosome when Leu-tRNALeuGAG in the reaction mixture was
substituted for the cognate Phe-tRNAPhe. The measured ribo-
some activity was typically 80–90%. We also determined
kcat/Km for the cognate reaction of fMet-Phe dipeptide
formation. All experiments were carried out with an in vitro
system with components of high purity (41). The results reveal
a small but significant increase in the accuracy of codon read-
ing by the presence of SmpB (Figure 6). The kcat/Km value for
the near-cognate codon reading was 98 M1 s1 in the pres-
ence and 142 M1 s1 in the absence of SmpB, while the
cognate kcat/Km value was unaffected by the presence or
absence of SmpB.
DISCUSSION
Here, we show that the 70S ribosome binds two molecules of
SmpB in agreement with earlier data (24). The footprinting
data suggest that one binding site is in the neck region of the
30S subunit close to the 30S P-site. The other binding site,
on the 50S subunit, is close to the factor-binding site and to
the so-called GAC, composed of helices H43 and H44 and
r-protein L11. The data also show that several SmpB protected
sites that are present on either one of the isolated subunits
disappear in the 70S ribosome.
In 16S rRNA, these sites are often involved in inter-subunit
contacts. Thus, the DMS reactivity of A790, the kethoxal
reactivity of G791 as well as the hydroxyl radical footprints
in helix H24 and the connecting 790-loop disappear upon
subunit–subunit association (40). This makes it more difficult
to evaluate the SmpB binding to the 790-region in 16S rRNA
in the 70S ribosome. However, base-specific SmpB-footprints
are still seen at positions 794 and 795, suggesting that SmpB
interacts with this region of 16S rRNA in the 70S ribosome.
Moreover, SmpB still footprints the 690-loop and nucleotides
G926 and G927 in the 70S ribosome with no additional foot-
prints detected elsewhere in 16S rRNA, indicating that the
binding of SmpB is not shifted on the 70S ribosome compared
with the 30S subunit. Altogether, this suggests that SmpB
interacts with similar regions in the 70S ribosome and the
30S subunit, although the interaction with the former must
be perturbed by the subunit–subunit bridge B2b formed by
the 790-loop and helices 69 and 71 in 23S rRNA (1).
In contrast, in 23S rRNA, SmpB-footprints disappear in the
a-sarcin/ricin-loop even though this loop is not involved in
70S formation (Figure 4B) (40). In the apical loop of helix
H44, which is part of the GAC, the SmpB-footprints are stron-
ger in the 70S ribosome than in the 50S subunit. This suggests
a small shift of the SmpB-binding site on the 50S subunit
towards the GAC, when the 70S ribosome is formed.
There is a small but significant increase in the accuracy of
codon reading by the presence of SmpB on the ribosome
(Figure 6). This effect is much smaller than the large accuracy
changes induced by the presence of antibiotics or restrictive
mutations in r-protein S12 (42–44). This shows that SmpB
affects A-site-related processes even though our footprinting
results do not suggest that SmpB binds to the 30S A-site of the
ribosome. However, it is possible that it is the 50S-bound
SmpB that affects translation accuracy by subtly changing
the interaction of ternary complexes with the GAC on the
50S subunit of the ribosome.
A comparison of the SmpB-footprints in 16S rRNA with the
interaction sites of P- and E-site bound tRNAs (Figure 2A)
show that SmpB footprints nucleotides that are normally inter-
acting with the ASLs of P- and E-site bound tRNAs (positions
34–39, where 35–37 is the anticodon). These sites overlap on
the 30S subunit (1,45). The data presented here support a
model where SmpB could functionally substitute an absent
ASL of tmRNA when peptidyl-tmRNA subsequently moves
into the P- and E-site of the 30S subunit. Interestingly, the N-3
position of C1400 that is situated in the P-site of the 30S
subunit is more susceptible to methylation by DMS when
SmpB is bound to the ribosome. At the same time, SmpB
footprints G926, i.e. 10 s, from C1400 in the 3D model
of 16S rRNA (3). This suggests that SmpB binds in close
proximity to the ribosomal P-site and affects its conformation.
This notion is supported by the observation that SmpB foot-
prints nt A790 and G791 (in the 790-loop) in the 30S subunit.

790-loop stabilize the interaction between bases A790 and
G791 and the backbone at positions 1497–1498 in 16S
rRNA (1,46).
We suggest that SmpB may favour similar interactions in
the empty 30S subunit. Furthermore, SmpB may stabilize the
post-translocation peptidyl-tmRNASmpBribosome com-
plex, thereby ensuring an accurate shift in codon reading
from the mRNA to the tmRNA mode. In addition, SmpB
may be important for rapid translocation of tmRNA from
the A- to the P-site and then from the P- to the E-site by
making up for missing interactions, between tmRNA and
the ribosomal P-site that are important for translocation of
tRNAs (47,48).
The footprints in the apical loop of H89 and in helices H43
and H44 in the 50S subunit are consistent with the SmpB-
positioning in the cryo-EM structure of the complex between
Ala-tmRNA and 70S ribosomes in the presence of EF-Tu
GDPKirromycin (15). In this complex, SmpB is modelled
in the electron density map so that it simultaneously contacts
the TLD and the apical loop of helix H89 and is in close
proximity to helices H69 and H71 in domain IV of 23S
rRNA (15). Our footprints in the H89 helix are in general
agreement with the proposed placement of SmpB in the
cryo-EM structure. However, the absence of SmpB-
footprints on helices 69 and 71, both in the free 50S subunit
and in the 70S ribosome, indicates that the actual SmpB-
binding site on the 50S subunit should be located closer
to the 1070- and 1095-loops than in the cryo-EM
reconstruction (19).
The probable binding site of SmpB on the 30S subunit,
presented here, can be compared with the proposal by
Gutmann et al. (22). In their model, based on docking of
the crystal structure of the SmpBTLD complex into the struc-
ture of the 70S ribosome in complex with the A-site tRNA (1),
SmpB is oriented towards the A-site of the small subunit. In
contrast, our data suggest that SmpB binds close to the P-site,
rather than to the A-site of the 30S subunit. One reason for this
discrepancy could be that the A-site positioning of SmpB
requires the presence of tmRNA on the ribosome and that it
occurs only after Ala-tmRNA accommodation in the A-site of
the 50S subunit.
Our results show that purified SmpB binds to both 30S and
50S particles in 1:1 molar ratios and to 70S ribosomes in a 2:1
molar ratio. The mapping of the SmpB-footprinted nucleotides
on the crystal structure of the 70S ribosome shown in Figure 5
indicates that it is highly unlikely that one SmpB molecule
could account for footprints both in the platform region of the
30S subunit and for the footprints below the L7/L12-stalk of
the 50S subunit, since these two regions are more than 70 s
apart in the 70S crystal structure (1,3). Therefore, the foot-
printing data support the notion that two molecules of SmpB
bind to the empty 70S ribosome. SmpB bound to the 30S
subunit was not observed by cryo-EM (15). One explanation
similar to that of Gutman et al. (22) could be that SmpB moves
from its 50S location (15) to the 30S location concomitantly
with the accommodation of Ala-tmRNA in the A-site of
the 50S subunit or, more probably, at a later stage in trans-
translation after translocation of the peptidyl-tmRNA into the
P-site as discussed above. For example, it could be that the 50S
footprint corresponds to the entry to and the 30S footprint to
the exit from the ribosome of the TLD domain of tmRNA in
complex with SmpB. However, in order for the 50S-oriented
SmpB in the pre-accommodation cryo-EM-structure of the
SmpBTuGDPAla-tmRNA complex to become oriented
towards the A-site in the post-accommodation state as in
the model by Gutman et al. (22), the D-loop of tmRNA
through which SmpB binds to tmRNA must rotate by more
than 100 with respect to the orientation of the acceptor stem
of tmRNA. This huge conformational change in tmRNA upon
its A-site accommodation is hardly feasible. Therefore, we
suggest an alternative that involves two molecules of
SmpB. One remains bound to the 50S subunit as in the
cryo-EM reconstruction (15), while the other SmpB molecule
is bound to tmRNA, as in the docking model by Gutmann et al.
(22). The latter SmpB molecule subsequently follows tmRNA
as it moves from site to site on the ribosome during trans-
translation. It could functionally substitute for the missing
ASL of tmRNA, as it moves from A- to P- to E-site and
thus be responsible for the observed footprints on the 30S
subunit. The strong footprints we observe in the P-site of
the 30S subunit may reflect the relatively strong affinity of
SmpB for the small ribosomal subunit (Figure 1). This binding
energy could be the key to how SmpB facilitates translocation
of tmRNA from the A- to the P-site. In summary, we suggest
that two SmpB molecules participate in trans-translation, one
facilitating the interaction of tmRNA with the 50S subunit and
the other facilitating the tmRNA interaction with the 30S
subunit. The 30S-oriented SmpB molecule could simply
have been missed in the cryo-EM reconstruction, due to the
relatively low resolution (13–15 s) of the electron density map
in this study (15). Future experiments will be required to
discriminate between the one- and the two-SmpB scenarios
in trans-translation.
