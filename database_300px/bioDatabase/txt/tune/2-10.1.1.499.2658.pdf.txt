ABSTRACT
We have developed three strategies to discriminate
among the three types of tRNA genes with anticodon
CAT (tRNAIle, elongator tRNAMet and initiator
tRNAfMet) in bacterial genomes. With these strategies,
we have classified the tRNA genes from 234 bacterial
and several organellar genomes. These sequences,
in an aligned or unaligned format, may be used for
the identification and annotation of tRNA (CAT)
genes in other genomes. The first strategy is based
on the position of the problem sequences in a
phenogram (a tree-like network), the second on the
minimum average number of differences against the
tRNA sequences of the three types and the third on
the search for the highest score value against the
profiles of the three types of tRNA genes. The
species with the maximum number of tRNAfMet and
tRNAMet was Photobacterium profundum, whereas
the genome of one Escherichia coli strain presented
the maximum number of tRNAIle (CAT) genes. This
last tRNA gene and tilS, encoding an RNA-modifying
enzyme, are not essential in bacteria. The acquisition
of a tRNAIle (TAT) gene by Mycoplasma mobile has
led to the loss of both the tRNAIle (CAT) and the tilS
genes. The new tRNA has appropriated the function
of decoding AUA codons.
INTRODUCTION
The prediction of non-coding RNA genes during the course of
the annotation of a genome is a difficult task, which requires
not only the search by sequence similarity but also the predic-
tion of secondary structures in the transcribed RNAs. Because
each RNA type presents its own structure, which includes
essential and optional parts, the development of specific meth-
ods for each type is required. The cloverleaf secondary struc-
ture of tRNAs has served as an approach to identify putative
tRNA specifying sequences in the DNA. This is one of the
strategies of the program tRNAscan-SE (1) to identify and
annotate tRNA genes. This program is probably the most
widely used in genome annotation. After the identification
of the anticodon loop, each tRNA gene is marked with the
anticodon sequence and the associated amino acid, giving a
score for this assignment. The accuracy of this program is
high, although with limitations due to the post-transcriptional
anticodon modifications, or difficulty in identifying pseudo-
genes. The initiator tRNA may not be distinguishable from
the elongator tRNAMet.
An alternative program, called TFAM (2), has recently
been developed. It is based on the proximity to profiles that
are mainly due to the presence of determinants in the tRNA
sequences, which would putatively be associated with the
binding by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases or the tRNA
modification enzymes. By using this program, each tRNA
sequence receives a score of proximity to the 21 tRNA pro-
files. They include the initiator formylmethionine tRNA and
the 20 types of elongator tRNAs. This approach, combined
with the sequence of the anticodon, may detect some special
cases such as the Trp tRNAs from some Mycoplasma species
that are incorrectly identified as Selenocysteine tRNAs by
tRNAscan-SE. It also permits the detection of situations
where the anticodon and the class against which TFAM has
maximum score do not coincide, as a consequence of several
situations such as, for example, post-transcriptional nucleot-
ide substitutions compared with the anticodon DNA
sequence.
The programs described previously, as well as other tRNA
prediction programs, are unable to identify one special type
of tRNA with anticodon CAU which, after modification to
convert cytidine into lysidine, a lysine-containing cytidine,
is recognized by isoleucine tRNA synthetase, charging
isoleucine and changing codon recognition to AUA (3). The
decoding of the codons AUN with the correct discrimination
between AUG and the remaining codons to specifically trans-
late Met or Ile is solved by several strategies in Archaea,
Bacteria, Eukarya and Organelles (3,4). The strategy in
bacterial genomes is exemplified in Escherichia coli or Bacil-
lus subtilis by the presence of four tRNA species: two tRNAs
with anticodon CAU for the decoding of the AUG codon as
initiator or elongator, one tRNA (GAU) to decode AUY
codons, and one tRNA (LAU) where L (lysidine) is a C34
modified with lysine to restrict decoding specifically to
AUA. The enzyme responsible for this last modification is

TilS (tRNAIle-lysidine synthase) and its gene was recently
identified and given the name tilS (alternative names mesJ
and yacA) (5). TilS is an RNA-modifying enzyme found in
all the complete genomic sequences of bacteria and, for
that reason, has been proposed as one of the 206 essential
protein-coding genes required for maintaining bacterial cell
life (6). Eukaryotes have solved this problem by producing
a special tRNA where A34 is modified to Inosine (I). The anti-
codon IAU binds to the three codons (AUH) decoding as Ile.
The two types of tRNA (CAU) decode only the AUG codon,
either initiator or elongator as Met (3). In some eukaryotes,
an additional tRNA (UAU) with U34 modified is used to
decode AUA preferentially or restrictively (7). This type of
tRNA gene with this anticodon may also be detected in a
few bacterial genomes (8).
Bacterial tRNA types with anticodon CAU have to be
recognized correctly by isoleucyl- and methionyl-tRNA syn-
thetases in order to charge Ile or Met, respectively. The first
step for tRNAIle (CAU) before being charged with isoleucine
is the conversion of C34 to lysidine. TilS discriminates this
tRNA from tRNAMet. Once the tRNA (LAU) is produced,
the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is able to charge it with Ile.
It has been proposed based on the analysis of E.coli and
Aquifex aeolicus that although tRNAIle (CAU) and tRNAMet
are very similar, their sequences are equipped with four sets
of determinants that are positively or negatively recognized
by the two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, by TilS and by a
putative acetyltransferase which could modify C34 from
the elongator tRNAMet to acetylcytidine (9). The action of
TilS is very important because in many bacterial species
the modified tRNAIle (LAU) is the only tRNA able to read
AUA codons. However, the presence of a few unmodified
tRNAIle (CAU) molecules in the cell does not produce
translating problems, because these molecules behave as
elongator tRNAMet, being recognized by the methionyl-
tRNA synthetase and charged with Met. They decode AUG
codons.
The positive or negative determinants of these tRNAs
are not universal and E.coli TilS is unable to recognize
A.aeolicus tRNAIle (CAU), probably because the two pairs
of positive determinants C4G69 and C5G68, at the aminoacyl
stem are not conserved (9). Analysis of TilS and tRNA
sequences in several bacteria indicates that this protein,
tRNAIle (CAU) and tRNAMet are coevolving with the aim
of discriminating between both tRNA types (9,10).
In this study, we analysed the tRNA gene sequences with
an anticodon CAT (the term anticodon is used by extension to
describe at the DNA level the corresponding nucleotides to
those present in the tRNA molecule) of 234 bacterial gen-
omes and 10 organellar genomes. The aim of this work was
to classify them into the three known types (Ile, initiator and
elongator Met) and to develop methods to discriminate
among them, especially to identify the tRNAIle (CAT) genes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial tRNA gene sequences
A total of 234 bacterial genomes were used in this study to
identify the three types of tRNAs with anticodon CAT.
They were all bacterial genomes present in the Genomic
tRNA database (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/) plus
Mycoplasma capricolum. This database contains tRNA gene
sequences identified and classified using the program
tRNAscan-SE (1). Twelve tRNA genes that were not
included in the genome lists of the database were extracted
from the NCBI genome annotation. Two tRNAs, required
to complete the three-type set, were identified by BLAST
(see, in Supplementary Data, a table with the number of
genes of each type in the analysed genomes). The sequences
of the tRNA genes from 10 organellar genomes (6 chloroplast
and 4 mitochondria) were also extracted from the NCBI data-
base. Finally, we observed in the nucleotide alignments that
some tRNA gene sequences of Vibrio fischeri did not contain
the first and last nucleotides. Looking at the genome
sequence, we realized that this was a mistake of the tRNA
database. We included the complete sequences of these
genes.
To test the annotation strategies, the tRNA genes with
anticodon CAT of Hahella chejuensis, Pelobacter carbinoli-
cus and Salinibacter ruber were extracted from the NCBI
genomes database.
Computational sequence analyses
Sequences were aligned using the program CLUSTAL
X (11). For the iterative incorporation (see Results) of the
sequences of new taxonomic groups to the previous align-
ment, the option of profile alignment was used.
Alignment files were converted to MEGA in order to
perform analyses using the program MEGA3 (12). Tree-like
networks were obtained based on the number of pairwise dif-
ferences and, may therefore be defined as phenograms. They
were obtained with the neighbour-joining program (13) with
the option of complete deletion, which removes any nucleot-
ide site that does not contain a nucleotide in each one of the
analysed genomes. After classification of the sequences into
groups, distance matrices based on the number of differences
were estimated with the option Between Groups Means.
The proximity to a specific tRNA profile was performed
using the program TFAM (2). This program uses unaligned
tRNA or tDNA sequences in the Fasta format as input. It
first needs to produce position-specific scoring matrices for
each tRNA gene type and later compares problem sequences
with these profiles, producing a positive or negative score in
front of them. In order to make comparisons, the program
produces an alignment based on sequence similarity and sec-
ondary structural information. Sequences classified as the
tRNA gene types Ile, Met and fMet were introduced into
the program to create the three profiles. Later, the program
TFAM was run with each one of these sequences (as well
as with the sequences of H.chejuensis, P.carbinolicus and
S.ruber) giving the scores against each of the three profiles.

aceae were aligned and a phenogram was obtained by using
the neighbour-joining method and a pairwise distance matrix

obtained with the number of differences (Figure 1A). Three
well-defined clusters were obtained with an average number
of 22–30 differences among them. The identity of each
cluster was determined based on the known sequences of
the three types in E.coli (14). The same strategy to identify
the three groups was followed with the taxonomic groups
of Clostridia and Mollicutes. The sequences of the tRNAs
from M.capricolum (15) were used to identify each tRNA
type. In spite of the use of a more divergent group of species,
the three tRNA clusters were well-separated and identified
based on the positions of the three M.capricolum tRNAs
(Figure 1B). When the sequences of both taxonomic groups
(Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridia/Mollicutes) were aligned
and used to construct the phenogram, the tree obtained
correctly clustered the tRNAs of each type (data not shown).
Identification of tRNA genes with anticodon CAT in
other bacterial taxonomic groups
In order to determine for any taxonomic group which tRNA
corresponded to each type and whether the three clusters
could be easily identified, we continued as follows:
(i) The sequences of the tRNAs with anticodon CAT of a
specific taxonomic group were obtained and aligned.
(ii) A phenogram was constructed using the neighbour-
joining method and a pairwise distance matrix obtained
with the number of differences.
(iii) The number of tRNAs for each species was checked and,
in case that there was a species without a sequence of the
three tRNA types, the genome annotation file was revised
and/or a BLAST search against the genome sequence
was carried out.
(iv) The previous alignment was then aligned to a total tRNA
alignment which started with the Enterobacterial,
Clostridia and Mollicutes sequences but was continu-
ously increasing at each step with the incorporation of
each new taxon.
(v) The number of nucleotide differences among the three
tRNAs groups of the new taxon and the previously
identified groups of the total tRNA alignment was esti-
mated. Each group was identified based on the average
number of differences against the tRNAIle (CAT),
tRNAMet (CAT) and tRNAfMet (CAT) of all taxonomic
groups.
(vi) After identification, the new taxon tRNA group
sequences were maintained in the total alignment and
a new taxonomic group was analysed from step (i).
Once every taxonomic group had been incorporated into
the alignment, including samples of mitochondrial and
chloroplast tRNA gene sequences, the average number of dif-
ferences between the sets at each taxonomic group and the
whole sets was re-estimated (Table 1). The tRNAfMet groups
were very similar, with a range of average differences of
6.2–10.5, except for the more divergent mitochondrial
tRNAs (14.7). It permitted an easy identification of this
type of tRNA. The discrimination between the two other
tRNA types was more difficult. However, given a taxonomic
group, we can compare the number of differences of the two
unclassified tRNA clusters against the remaining taxonomic
groups and estimate the quotient of the average number of
differences against tRNAIle (CAT) by those against tRNAMet
(Table 1). This quotient produced values of 0.6–0.9 for the
groups identified as tRNAIle and 1.2–1.5 for those identified
as tRNAMet. The closest values were obtained for Cyanobac-
teria with 0.9 and 1.2 for the tRNA groups identified as
tRNAIle and tRNAMet, respectively. In some taxonomic
groups such as Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Plancto-
myces, the tRNAIle gene sequences were only slightly more
similar to the Ile than to the Met type (Ile/Met ratio 0.9).
However, their tRNAMet sequences were more dissimilar
(1.3, 1.2 and 1.4, respectively), indicating that the identifica-
tion of tRNAIle genes is more related to their dissimilarity to
the Met than to the similarity to the Ile-type sequence.
The identification of the three groups was also supported
by the production of three clusters in the phenogram with
the complete tRNA sets of the 234 analysed genomes plus
the 10 organellar genomes (Figure 2). The previously
known tRNAs types from B.subtilis, A.aeolicus, Chloroplasts
and mitochondria clustered correctly with their corresponding
tRNA types. Several nucleotide sites could be established as
positive or negative discriminators between tRNAIle (CAT)
and tRNAMet (CAT) genes. Especially, the base pairs at the
acceptor stem are remarkable: 3–70, 4–69 and 5–68, accord-
ing to the Sprinzl position indexing (16). Nucleotides G3, A3,
C70 and T70 could be a complete negative discriminator for
either tRNAMet or tRNAfMet genes. At these positions both
tRNAs usually have the pair C3–G70; therefore, G3, A3, C70
and T70 indicate a tRNA
Ile gene. On the other hand, pairs
C4–G69 and C5–G68 are very frequent in the tRNA
Ile (CAT)
gene, whereas the pairs A11–T24 and G12–C23 at the D stem
seem to be complete discriminators of fMet unlike the two
other tRNAs.
Finally, we created three tRNA profiles with 457 fMet,
293 Ile and 288 Met tRNA sequences that comprise the com-
plete tRNA set with the exception of the organellar sequences
and a few tRNAs of uncertain classification. These profiles
were obtained using the program TFAM (2). Each of the
1070 tRNA sequences analysed in this study (including
organellar and those difficult to classify) was compared
with the 3 profiles and only in 10 cases there was a discrep-
ancy from our previous classification. Six cases corresponded
to the tRNAMet of Bordetella spp. and some Cyanobacteria
which gave a positive value against the profiles of Ile and
Met, slightly higher for the former. Our identification of

these tRNAs as Met is based on the fact that two of the three
types of tRNA sequences in these species have a high
proximity to the profiles of fMet and Ile (score values higher
than 40 for their corresponding tRNA type and negative
for the others), whereas the sequences of the third group
have positive scores for both Met and Ile and negative for
fMet. Classification was difficult for two divergent (against
other delta-Proteobacteria) Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus
tRNAs, for one Bordetella bronchiseptica tRNA and a mito-
chondrial tRNA (Pseudendoclonium akinetum). A 3D plot
with the TFAM scores shows the isolation of the sequences
belonging to the three groups, except for a few points
(Figure 3).
There were two genomes in which at least one copy
of each type of tRNA gene could not be identified.
The first, Mycoplasma mobile has actually lost the tRNAIle
(CAT), whereas the second was one of the strains of
Streptococcus pyogenes (strain SF370 serotype M1), which
has only two fMet tRNAs and no other tRNAs (CAT)
could be detected in the genome sequence. A putative
sequence assembly problem in a genome region with 28 tan-
dem tRNAs in other strains and only 21 in this strain could be
the reason.
The maximum number of genes in tRNAs with anticodon
CAT corresponds to Photobacterium profundum with
15 copies. It is also the species with the maximum number
of tRNAfMet and tRNAMet (8 and 5 genes, respectively).
The genome of E.coli strain O157:H7 possesses 9 tRNAIle
(CAT) genes, the maximum number among the genomes
analysed (see a table with the number of genes of each
type in the analysed genomes in Supplementary Data).
Annotation of tRNA genes with anticodon CAT in
bacterial genomes
We propose three methods for the annotation of the three
types of tRNA (anticodon CAT) in bacterial genomes based
on the aligned sequence groups described previously.
(i) After identification with the tRNAscan program of the
tRNA sequences with anticodon CAT in a genome, they
will be aligned with the total tRNA set alignment
(Supplementary Data) or with the tRNA alignment of the
taxonomic group to which the species belongs.

will be obtained and the position of the new sequences in
the tree will indicate how the tRNA gene should be
annotated.
(ii) A second strategy is the use of the average number of
differences of each problem tRNA sequence compared
with the three groups of sequences containing the Ile,
Met and fMet tRNA types annotated in this paper. After
alignment, the sequence file is converted to the MEGA
format. The file is then opened with MEGA and groups
are created for each one of the problem tRNA sequences
and for the complete sets of fMet, Ile and Met
sequences. Later, a matrix is obtained with the tool
Compute Between Groups Means. The matrix is
extracted and the average number of differences between
each new sequence and the tRNA groups for fMet, Ile
and Met, respectively, are estimated. Sequences corre-
sponding to tRNAfMet are easily identified based on the
small number of differences with the fMet group.
Sequences corresponding to the two other types of
tRNAs are identified based on the smallest number of
differences. The quotient of the value for tRNAIle by
tRNAMet may indicate the confidence of the identifica-
tion. An example of this strategy for annotating tRNA
genes is shown in Table 2 (A) for the genomes of
H.chejuensis, P.carbinolicus and S.ruber. The restriction
of the analyses to the use of the tRNA sequences of the
species’ taxonomic group produces more extreme Ile/
Met values and a more precise identification
(see Table 2, B). In a few cases the use of the total
tRNA set produces an incorrect annotation (see tRNA
gene sru2 in Table 2) and, for that reason, we
recommend the use of the species’ taxonomic group set.
(iii) Finally, we may use the profiles for three tRNA
types and run TFAM with the problem sequences
(Table 2, C) (see Supplementary Data for files contain-
ing the unaligned tRNA gene sequences in a TFAM
input format, the coveam file and a table of name
equivalences).
We have tested the first and third strategies with the com-
plete datasets producing a discrepancy <1% due to a few
atypical sequences and to the six genes producing an incor-
rect TFAM annotation due to the positive scores for both
Ile and Met profiles (see above). We have not tested the
complete dataset with the second strategy but, for any of
the tested sequences, it produces the same results than
those of the first strategy when the species’ taxonomic
group set is used.
TilS protein and tRNAIle (LAU) may be substituted by a
tRNAIle (UAU) in bacteria
Classification of the tRNAs with anticodon CAT revealed
that the genomes of M.mobile did not contain any tRNAIle
(CAT) gene. However, thousands of AUA codons of the
coding mRNAs of this species ought to be read. The explana-
tion was that a new tRNA, very unusual in bacteria, was pre-
sent. This tRNA contained an anticodon UAU (TAT in
DNA). Its sequence was more similar to tRNAIle (GAT)
than to the other types. It could be produced through the sub-
stitution of G34 by T at the tRNA gene. The U34 nucleotides
at anticodons may read codons ending with any of the four
nucleotides, A- or G-ending codons, only A, or even other
cases depending of the type of tRNA, U34 modification and
species (4). The genome of M.mobile contains the genes
whose encoded proteins are required to produce some
modified U34. This will reduce the decoding on this tRNA
to several possibilities including (i) the equivalent decoding
capability of A and G codons, (ii) the preferential decoding
of A- versus G-ending or, even (iii) the complete restriction
to the AUA codon.
The tilS gene was not annotated in the M.mobile genome.
We searched the genome using BLAST (tblastn with the
Mycoplasma pulmonis TilS protein as a query, cut-off
expected value ¼ 1) without success and finally we compared
the genome region where the gene was present in other

related Mycoplasma such as Mycoplasma synoviae, M.pulmo-
nis and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Figure 4). The tilS gene
was flanked by pth and ftsH in the other genomes whereas in
M.mobile not only was the gene lost, but also the DNA was
disintegrated indicating that Mycoplasma spp., in spite of
their small genomes, are still able to lose the non-functional
DNA as has been previously stated for bacterial endosym-
biont genomes (17,18).
DISCUSSION
Living organisms use different strategies for decoding AUN
codons (3). Although eukaryotic nuclear genomes maintain
the standard codon amino acid correspondence (AUH for
Ile and AUG for Met), a few mitochondrial genomes have
reassigned the AUA codon to Met. Bacteria and Archaea
decode AUY codons with tRNAs with anticodon GAU,
whereas the AUA codon requires a special tRNA type in
which C34 is modified to specifically recognize the A-ending
codons. In bacteria, the modified nucleotide is lysidine (14).
Three types of tRNA genes with anticodon CAT are detected
in bacterial genomes (tRNAIle, tRNAMet and tRNAfMet). Our
results show that all three types of tRNA genes may be
detected in spite of the small number of nucleotide sites
that can be used for their classification. In this paper we
have used a system of recruitment based on previous knowl-
edge of the type of tRNA in E.coli and M.capricolum. Based
on the proximity to the E.coli and M.capricolum sequences,
we were able to completely classify the tRNAs from 234 gen-
omes. Initiator tRNAs were more easily classified because of
higher conservation. Discrimination between elongator
tRNAMet and tRNAIle was more difficult, especially in
some taxonomic groups such as Cyanobacteria. Our results
have shown that for any taxonomic group it is easy to pro-
duce a phenogram with three well-isolated groups. However,
the maintenance of the three groups became more difficult as
more distant taxonomic groups were included in the analysis.
The reason is because tRNA genes and gene encoding
enzymes involved in nucleotide modifications and aminoacy-
lation are coevolving in such a way that positive or negative
determinants in some species may not be important for oth-
ers. Thus, the pairs C4–G69 and C5–G68 in the tRNA
Ile
(CAU) are required for the E.coli TilS enzyme for use as a
substrate. However, the loss of the CTD2 domain in the
A.aeolicus TilS enzyme has meant that these 2 nt pairs were
not conserved in the tRNAIle (CAU), with the consequence
that the E.coli enzyme is now unable to use in vitro the
A.aeolicus tRNA as a substrate (9).

We propose three methods for the annotation of the three
types of genes in bacterial genomes, all of them based on
our previous identification of more than 1000 tRNA genes.
Identification may be performed based on tree topology, the
number of differences compared with type-known sequences
or the proximity to three profiles built on the frequencies of
nucleotides at each nucleotide position. This is the first
time that a method for distinguishing between elongator
tRNAMet and tRNAIle has been developed and it improves
the annotation by other systems such as tRNAscan-SE
(1) and TFAM (2).
Several nucleotide positions distinguish tRNAfMet from the
other two with complete precision. A comparison of our
results with those features of eubacterial initiator tRNAfMet,
previously described in the literature (19), revealed that the
feature GGG..CCC (positions 29–31 and 39–41), important
for targeting the tRNA to the ribosome P-site, is not con-
served in the 15% of the tRNA genes that we have classified
as fMet. Most of the differences are in alpha-Proteobacteria
and in Chloroplast (they show the signature AGG..CCT),
but also in some Mycoplasma spp. and mitochondria. Our
alignment showed that the conserved feature is R29G30G31..
Y39C40Y41. Two other features proposed to be required for
formylation are the A11–U24 base pair at the D stem and
the bases C1, G2, C3, G70, C71 and A72 at the acceptor stem
(19). The A11 and T24 nucleotides are conserved in 100%
of the tRNAfMet genes (except the divergent previously
described B.bronchiseptica tRNA). The nucleotides at the
acceptor stem were almost conserved in 100% of the
sequences. In 1.5% of them, the important mismatch
C1–A72 was replaced by the weak base pair A1–U72 or
U1–A72. This change is probably not affecting the
formylation of these tRNAs.
The distinction of tRNAMet and tRNAIle is more difficult
and requires more from the proximity to a profile than from
the presence of a special positive or negative determinant.
The analysis of 234 genomes has shown one species which
lacks the gene tRNAIle (CAT). We have been able to establish
a scenario in which a new tRNA gene with anticodon TAT
has substituted not only the tRNAIle (CAT) but also the tilS
gene. This means that tilS is not an essential gene as proposed
previously (6), based on several mutagenesis studies, in its
presence (with the name mesJ) in the small genomes of
many bacterial endosymbionts (18,20) and even in all gamma-
Proteobacterial analysed genomes (21). However, the fact
that M.mobile has up to now been the only bacterial genome
without these two genes may point to a non-perfect discrim-
ination of the AUA and AUG codons. Probably the tRNA
with anticodon UAU is erroneously decoding some AUG
codons, introducing Ile instead of Met in some polypeptides.
Some tRNAs with unmodified U34 anticodons are able to
decode the four codons of a codon family. This is the case
of Mycoplasma spp. and mitochondria (22,23). This possibil-
ity is clearly stated for some codon families when the analysis
of the tRNA gene content in some species reveals a single
tRNA (UNN) for the Ala, Val, Pro and Thr codons (8).
Several modifications of U34 restrict pairing to A- or
G-ending codons, and may even enhance the decoding of
the A-ending codons (4,22). The s2 modification
(2-thiouridine) could be predicted to enhance the reading
of, for example, the GAA versus GAG codon, as was demon-
strated in in vivo experiments (22). Modifications at position
5 of U34 are also involved in the restriction of tRNAs to the A
and G-ending codons. M.mobile contains the genes encoding
the enzymes required for several of these modifications
(mnmE, mnmG, nmmA and iscS) (24). With these enzymes
it would be able to produce 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-
2-thiouridine, a modified uridine detected in several
M.capricolum tRNAs (15). The lack of the gene mnmC in
Mycoplasma spp. is probably the reason why the common
5-methylaminomethyluridine and 5-methylaminomethyl-2-
thiouridine are not detected in M.capricolum tRNAs (15).
