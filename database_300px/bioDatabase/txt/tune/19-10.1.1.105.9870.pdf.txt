ABSTRACT
One of the biggest problems facing microarray
experiments is the difficulty of translating results
into other microarray formats or comparing microar-
ray results to other biochemical methods. We believe
that this is largely the result of poor gene identifica-
tion. We re-identified the probesets on the Affymetrix
U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip array. This identification was
based on the sequence of the probes and the
sequence of the human genome. Using the BLAST
program, we matched probes with documented and
postulated human transcripts. This resulted in the
redefinition of approximately 37% of the probes on
the U133 plus 2.0 array. This updated identification
specifically points out where the identification is
complicated by cross-hybridization from splice
variants or closely related genes. More than 5000
probesets detect multiple transcripts and therefore
theexactprotein affectedcannotbereadilyconcluded
from the performance of one probeset alone. This
makes naming difficult and impacts any downstream
analysis such as associating gene ontologies,
mapping affected pathways or simply validating
expression changes. We have now automated the
sequence-based identification and can more appro-
priately annotate any array where the sequence on
each spot is known.
INTRODUCTION
The current dogma suggests that microarray data is erratic and
poorly reproducible. It is recommended by the scientific com-
munity that all genes identified in a microarray experiment be
verified by a more commonly accepted method such as RT–
PCR or northerns (1). Yet there is significant evidence that
microarray data is highly reproducible (2–7). Why is it that the
technology is highly reproducible within one format, but less
reproducible when working across methodologies? A closer
look at reports, where microarray results were poorly repro-
duced or inconsistent with other methods, suggests that the
fault does not lie with the biochemical methods, but rather with
the bookkeeping (8,9). For example, experiments using spot-
ted cDNAs are dependent on the accurate maintenance of the
bacterial stocks that house the DNA eventually used on spots.
This is not always done effectively. Some arrays can have as
many as 30% of their spots misidentified because of errors in
the DNA stocks (9–11). Because of this, many spotted arrays
now use sequence-verified clones or synthesized oligos
(12–14). However, this does not remove all possible sources
of misidentification.
The alternative to spotted microarrays has been the in situ
synthesized oligonucleotide arrays marketed by the Affymet-
rix Corporation (15). This format has less chance for error
since the sequence produced on each spot is known. Yet,
even this format can be plagued by incorrectly identified
spots (8,16). Part of the problem is that the probes on an
array are identified based on what the company was hoping
to detect, not based on what they actually detect. There are two
reasons why these are not the same thing. One is the concept
that each spot should detect a single gene; the second is that
there are often problems with the sequences upon which the
probes are based. One example of this latter problem is illus-
trated by the probeset 214019_at, found on the Human
Genome U133A chip and the U133 plus 2.0 arrays. The pro-
bes in this probeset were designed based on the GenBank
sequence Z23022. According to the description of this gene
at the NetAffx annotation support site for Affymetrix, this
probeset identifies the transcript for cyclin D1. But it does
not. The sequence Z23022 is a hybrid sequence and does
not represent an actual cellular transcript. Part of this GenBank
sequence comes from the cyclin D1 gene, which is located on
chromosome 11; the rest of the sequence is derived from the
tip of chromosome 19. The probes synthesized on each array
are designed from the chromosome 19 portion of this hybrid
sequence while the definition of the gene comes from
the chromosome 11 portion of the sequence. Therefore, the
annotation describes this probeset as cyclin D1 although
the probes instead detect a mildly repetitive sequence in the

human genome that has retroviral characteristics. This ERVK
element is repeated hundreds of times in the human genome
with the closest copy over 1.9 million bases downstream of the
cyclin D1 gene.
The fact that a probe sequence can detect more than one
gene is a more pervasive problem. A hybrid clone, like the one
described above, would certainly detect more than one gene if
it were used as a cDNA spot. However, even short oligonuc-
leotides can detect more than one gene. Many primary tran-
scripts are alternatively spliced under different growth
conditions or in different cell types. According to the original
definition of a gene, these alternative transcripts should be
considered different genes. They are more commonly referred
to as splice variants. Either way, it is uninformative to consider
all splice variants as equivalent. Consider the case of the
FLICE-inhibitory proteins. These are encoded from the
same locus, but some isoforms are pro-apoptotic and others
are anti-apoptotic (17). It is essential that one knows which
isoforms are expressed in order to fully understand the
implications of an increase or decrease observed in a microar-
ray experiment. An oligonucleotide, or other probe, that
detects several splice variants is not as informative as one
that detects a single species of transcript. A proper probe
identification should indicate which case applies. A second
reason that a probe may detect more than one gene is the
occurrence of duplicated genes and gene families. There are
numerous instances of closely related genes, and many times
cross-hybridization to DNA probes has been used to identify
these evolutionarily related sequences. In microarrays, this
cross-hybridization can be a problem unless it is properly
identified.
We have utilized the current knowledge of the human gen-
ome to make a more correct identification of the probesets on
an Affymetrix array. Using the sequence of the probes as the
starting point, we have re-identified the genes detected by the
commonly used U133 plus 2.0 array. Our final annotation
indicates where the identification is questionable or complic-
ated by cross-hybridization issues. This more realistic annota-
tion of spots on a microarray will allow individuals to more
accurately translate finding to other microarray formats and
design informative follow-up experiments.
METHODS
Our knowledge of the human genome is sufficiently mature to
allow it to form the reference state for the identification of
genes. The RefSeq initiative at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has been generating
model RNA molecules that represent individual transcripts
of human genes (18,19). We made use of these sequences,
and the locus from which they are derived, to identify genes
that are interrogated by individual probes on Affymetrix
GeneChips. Each probeset on a GeneChip consists of 22–48
oligonucleotide probes 25 bases long. Half of these are
designed to be a perfect match for a specific transcript. The
other half are designed with a single base mismatch in the
center of the 25 base oligonucleotide. Each cumulative set of
probes is designed to detect a selected region of a possible
transcript. This sequence is referred to as the ‘target’ for the
probes. These targets are available from Affymetrix through
their NetAffx web site (20). We used these targets for the
initial survey of possible transcripts that each probeset
might detect. We used the BLAST program to search
GenBank for any human RefSeq that matched the target
(21). In the absence of a human RefSeq, we accepted any
human sequence that matched the target. This initial search
used the blastn program against the nr database using a word-
size of 28. The returned results were collected and screened for
sequences pertaining to cDNAs or mRNAs and gave a score
greater than 100. These results were stored in a local database
associated with the probeset ID number from the chip. A
second screen was performed where each individual probe
within a probeset was compared with the sequences collected
from the first screen. Probes were scored based on how many
bases exactly matched the retrieved sequences. The sequence
with the best average score across all probes in a probeset was
chosen as the best match. This serves as the primary identi-
fication for the probeset. However, in many cases the probes
equally detected several reference sequences. When this
occurred, a probeset was listed as detecting multiple tran-
scripts. We have also indicated transcripts that scored
lower, but might also hybridize to probes in the probeset
and therefore contribute to the signal measured.
The probesets were also evaluated for a number of potential
complicating factors. Each probe on the array was compared to
the 8 ALU reference sequences that represent the most com-
mon members of this repetitive element commonly found in
human transcripts: Genbank accession numbers U14567,
U14568, U14569, U14570, U14571, U14572, U14573 and
U14574 (22). Probes that can hybridize to these sequences
are flagged. The database was also used to identify split or
chimeric probesets. If some of the probes in a probeset detec-
ted one sequence while the remainder detected a distinctly
different sequence, the probeset was selected for further
review. These probesets were then manually evaluated to dis-
tinguish between probesets that detected two distinct gene
products and those detecting possible splice variants, recogn-
izing complex loci such as the immunoglobulin genes, or
recognizing repetitive elements. Any probeset that failed to
find a matching sequence through any of the above techniques
was manually identified by comparison to all available
GenBank sequences until a match was found.
The database of annotation is available at http://mriweb.
moffitt.usf.edu/mpv/. Details of the computational methods
and the database are also available online.
RESULTS
The Affymetrix gene chip U133 plus 2.0 contains 54 675
probesets. There are 62 probesets designed for special func-
tions, such as measuring supplementally added transcripts.
These probesets have the prefix AFFX. This leaves 54 613
probesets designed specifically for the detection of human
genes. We re-evaluated the identification of these probesets
using the sequence of each probe as the basis for the identi-
fication. This reassessment resulted in the renaming of 20 415
probesets. The revised identifications are available through the
link http://mriweb.moffitt.usf.edu/mpv/. Based on our new
identification of the probes on this array, we estimate that
the U133 plus 2.0 gene chip can detect more than 30 000
e31 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 3 PAGE 2 OF 9
human transcripts derived from more than 20 000 loci within
the human genome. This does not mean that in any single
experiment it would be possible to identify 30 000 genes.
Many probesets detect multiple genes and thus one may not
be able to discern which of several possible transcripts gave
rise to the hybridization signal.
Cross-hybridization affects gene identification
Cross-hybridization is an issue that was considered in the
design of the GeneChip arrays. The mismatch probes are
intended to capture non-specific cross-hybridization, so that
it can be accounted for in the analysis of the data. However, we
found 206 mismatch probes that are a perfect match for some
human transcript. In most cases, there is only one mismatch
probe affected per probeset and thus only a few calculations
will be adversely affected by this phenomenon. A bigger prob-
lem is specific cross-hybridization, where the perfect match
probes can recognize more than one transcript. We found over
5000 probesets that specifically hybridize to more than one
cataloged splice-variants or transcripts from another locus. We
have selected a few examples to illustrate the complexity of
this problem.
Gene families make up a significant portion of the human
genome. On the p arm of chromosome 9 there are 13 closely
related genes for interferon alphas (23). There are 13 probesets
on the U133 plus 2.0 chip that detect these genes. Table 1
shows that the closest match to these probesets, based on the
sequence of the probes, is not always the same species as
indicated by the Affymetrix annotation. This illustrates that
the best intentions of probe design are not always realized
when the experiment is performed. Our evaluation indicates
that there is considerable cross-hybridization expected
between these related transcripts and that the best match fam-
ily member is not the only transcript that can hybridize to these
probes. This point is best illustrated by the fact that the exact
same probe sequence (AGAAATACAGCCCTTGTGCCT-
GGGA) is used as one of the probes for seven different probe-
sets from this group. Two other probesets contain a closely
related overlapping sequence. There is no question that cross-
hybridization will occur when the sequence is exact, but
weaker matches must also be considered. When viewing a
spot on a microarray, one cannot tell the difference between
high expression combined with weak cross-hybridization and
low expression but perfect hybridization. Therefore, it would
be difficult to identify exactly which gene is responsible for the
signal detected without considering all 13 probesets as a
group. Perhaps viewing individual probes, reassigning probes
to novel probesets, or comparing the relative expression levels
between probesets can help one determine exactly which gene
is expressed. At a minimum, it is important to understand that
something more is required to interpret information related to
these genes and to properly design follow-up experiments.
One cannot evaluate these probesets as individuals and get
conclusive results.
A second example relates to the protocadherin gamma fam-
ily of genes. This family of genes has multiple variable first
exons, but share their 30 most exon (24,25). Since most probe-
sets are designed to detect the 30 regions of transcripts, they do
not distinguish between individual family members. The
probesets 205717_x_at, 209079_x_at, 211066_x_at and
215836_s_at detect all 22 different protocadherin gamma
family members because they recognize this shared terminal
exon. A few other probesets recognize some of the unique first
exons, but there are not enough probes to identify all members
of this gene family. One is therefore uncertain which

transcripts might be contributing to the behavior that led one
to find these probes in their microarray experiment.
Myosin 18A and TGFb1-induced apoptotic factor 1
(TIAF1) represent a similar situation. These two genes
share a common final exon. Myosin 18A is a large transcript
composed of more than 30 exons and there are two splice
variants encoding slightly different proteins. Both splice vari-
ants share a final exon with the 30 end of TIAF1. In this case,
there is only one probeset on the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 chip
(202039_at) and it recognizes this common 30 region. There-
fore, there is no mechanism for distinguishing which gene is
hybridizing to an array. Affymetrix has designated this probe-
set as recognizing TIAF1. A more proper designation should
indicate that it detects three possible transcripts so that the
appropriate gene can be eventually determined.
Some probes do not detect defined human genes
There are a number of probesets that do not recognize anything
in GenBank that might be a human mRNA and do not recogn-
ize anything in the current assembly of the human genome.
These probesets are listed in Table 2. Many of these do not
detect any transcript, but a few are convenient because of what
they do detect. Probeset 221106_at recognizes a rat gene and
does not cross-hybridize with anything in the human genome.
Although there is a corresponding human gene, it is suffi-
ciently different from the designed probes that the level of
cross-hybridization is expected to be minimal. There is very
little hybridization detected by this probeset in any tissue and
certainly much less than from the better designed probeset,
218675_at (data not shown). This probeset can help form a
basis for how much cross-hybridization one might expect from
weakly similar transcripts. Of more utility with respect to
cross-hybridization is the probeset 217680_x_at. Affymetrix
lists this probeset as recognizing the ribosomal protein L10. As
a probeset it does not, although some of the individual probes
do. These probes were also designed based on a chimeric EST
(expressed sequence tag) sequence and the probes span the
junction between ribosomal protein L10 sequences and vector
sequences. The probes that do recognize ribosomal protein
L10 provide an interesting look at the cross-hybridization
issues facing this technology. Table 3 shows that as individual
probes match more of the transcript for ribosomal protein L10,
the signal derived from hybridization increases. Probe 11
matches the L10 transcript across all 25 bases of the oligo.
Since ribosomes are essential components of cells, the L10
transcript is constitutively and highly expressed (26). This
probe has a high signal in all arrays hybridized with human
samples. For comparison purposes, compare the signal derived
from probeset 200725_x_at or the individual probes that com-
prise this probeset. In contrast, probes 10 through 7 match
progressively less of the ribosomal protein transcript. There
is also a corresponding decrease in the signal intensity recor-
ded by these probes. This decreased signal continues down to
the level expected from spurious cross-hybridization. Probes 1
and 2 from this probeset do not detect the ribosomal tran-
script, but possibly hybridize to a transcript from LOC388732.
The values in Table 3 are the average of 25 samples selected
at random. Two other probesets detect plasmid-derived
sequences rather than human transcripts. Probeset
211371_at detects the bovine growth hormone polyA
sequence incorporated into some expression vectors. The

probeset 222227_at detects the more commonly used SV40
polyA tail region. This is a very useful probeset because it
detects many of the expression vectors used for transient and
stable transfections. It can detect samples derived from trans-
fected cells and may be useful for identifying SV40 infected
tissues. Changes in the expression level of this probeset might
be useful in special circumstances, but for most experiments
the probesets listed in Table 1 should be removed from further
consideration before performing an analysis of the data.
We found 448 probesets that were the inverse complement
of the intended target gene. These probesets appear to have
been designed based on poorly defined sequences in which the
orientation was not defined and the gene names may have been
assigned later. As the inverse complement, the probes will not
detect the indicated gene. Not all of these probesets are use-
less. One of the interesting observations about the human
genome is that it is very common to find genes on opposite
strands of the chromosome arranged in tandem. Therefore, a
gene is arranged head-to-head with one adjacent neighbor and
probably shares a common promoter region and is arranged
tail-to-tail with the other neighbor. Genes arranged tail-to-tail
often overlap their 30 untranslated regions. Since many of the
Affymetrix probes are designed to detect the 30 untranslated
regions, a probeset can detect one of these genes and be the
inverse complement of the other. Therefore, many of the inver-
ted probesets have simply been assigned a new name. In many
cases, an adjacent gene could not be identified. Although a
name cannot be assigned, we can attempt to determine if the
probes are detecting a transcript. As a screen for presumptive
transcripts, we simply looked at the expression level across
more than 500 different microarrays generated from more than
130 different organs, tissues and cell lines. In the interest of
clarity, we have only presented the results of 100 samples
representing more than 50 different cell lines and tissues.
Figure 1 shows the expression level measured across these
100 samples for two probesets that appear to detect transcripts
and one probeset that does not appear to detect a transcript.
Since we have not tested all possible cell types, it is not pos-
sible to conclude that probesets such as 216868_s_at do not
detect anything. Nonetheless, they should be considered sus-
pect in any experiment. The probeset 213619_at appears to
detect a transcript in many different cells and tissues although

The probe values for the perfect match probes (PM) and the mismatch probes
(MM) are the average of 25 independent chip measurements.

to the complementary strand of the intended reference gene. Probeset

L38. The plots for probesets 213619_at and 216868_s_at illustrate the
difference between a probeset that detects a transcript and a probeset that
does not detect a transcript. Although each plot is represented against a
different scale, the relative expression levels are directly comparable.

the nature of this transcript is unknown. We have indicated that
probesets such as this detect no known gene in our identifica-
tion and therefore investigators will have to carefully consider
what might be detected by these probesets. As our understand-
ing of the human genome matures, these transcripts might
become known, but for now the identification is uncertain.
Using the expression level of samples from diverse cells
and tissues can sometimes yield surprising results. Figure 1
also shows the expression level across 100 tissues of the ribo-
somal protein L38. This ribosomal protein is constitutively and
consistently expressed. There are also two probesets on the
U133 plus 2.0 array that detect the complementary strand to
this gene. Probeset 202028_s_at is shown in Figure 1. Probeset
221943_x_at demonstrates the exact expression pattern (data
not shown). The results indicate that in some cell types there is
a transcript produced either from the opposite strand at the
ribosomal protein L38 locus or from one of the many pseudo-
genes for RPL38 found in the human genome. This transcript,
and its role in cells, has not yet been described. This kind of
discovery is only possible with a careful analysis of what the
probes detect.
Mixed probesets can complicate identification
We have identified 18 probesets that we define as chimeric
probesets. Some of the probes in the probeset detect one gene
and the rest detect a distinctly different gene. These appear to
have been designed based on chimeric sequences like those
described above. We have also found 153 probesets that con-
tain at least one probe that hybridizes to ALU sequences. ALU
sequences are highly repetitive elements that are found in the
genomes of all apes (22). The sequence is a component of
many genes and is incorporated into many transcripts. The
probeset designed specifically to detect this sequence
(AFFX-hum_alu_at) is always one of the highest intensity
probesets on any array. Individual probes that cross-
hybridize with ALU sequences can compromise the values
calculated for gene expression because the signal can come
from so many diverse transcripts. We have also found a num-
ber of probesets that contain one or two probes that do not
detect any human transcripts. Since the analysis algorithms are
designed to use all probes in a probeset, this can lead to a
diminished performance of the probeset as a group.
Gene annotations should contain indications of
uncertainty
The probeset annotation that we are advocating is represented
in Table 4. This table illustrates some of the cautions that
one must consider when identifying the ‘gene’ detected by
a probeset on any array. Some probesets detect multiple genes
or multiple splice variants from a single locus such as
201002_s_at and 203639_s_at respectively. We have identi-
fied other probesets on the array that can also identify these or
related transcripts. It may be possible to narrow the field of
possible transcripts by reviewing the behavior of all the related
probesets as a group. Occasionally, a probeset detects more
than one transcript and no mechanism exists to reduce the
choices further, such as with probeset 202039_at. In this
case, one will have to resort to some other experimental system
to determine the correct gene changed in the microarray
experiment performed. In some probesets, only a few of the
probes may efficiently bind to multiple human transcripts. This
is illustrated by probeset 206900_x_at. In this case, one might
wish to look at the probe level data to determine if the changes
are attributed to the primary gene or caused by cross-
hybridization of other transcripts. Although it is not indicated
in Table 4, we have the probes that might cross-hybridize in
the full database. Some probesets do not detect a gene very
effectively because of problems in the probe design. This is
represented by probeset 217547_x_at in Table 4. In this case,
because of inefficient binding of many of the probes to the
mRNA target, the signal from the microarray should be
viewed with caution. Probeset level data is based on the per-
formance of 11 or more probe pairs and when only a few of the
probes are hybridizing, it is unclear if the result is a con-
sequence of the probes that hybridize to target or the probes
that hybridize nonspecifically to other RNAs. Therefore, one
must view the results with caution and possibly rely on other
information. Some probesets do not match well with any
known human transcripts. Most of these are the result of
probes designed based on EST sequences. The U133 plus
2.0 array contains a large number of probesets that were
designed based on EST sequences. There are nearly 11 000
probesets that do not match a described human gene. In many
situations, the probes recognize sequences within the genetic
locus of a known gene, but not sequences found in documented
human transcripts. One example of this is shown for probeset
211610_at. Since we really know very little about the human
transcriptome, it is not possible to completely disregard these
probes. Many of these may be identified, as our knowledge
progresses. Currently, we have indicated that the probeset
should be checked carefully. It is possible that the signal
measured is due to noise, and it is equally possible that it is
due to an undescribed transcript. The reasons behind the beha-
vior observed for these probesets in a microarray experiment
require more evaluation and possibly follow-up experiments
by the scientist.
DISCUSSION
The improper identification of probes on a microarray can
influence many aspects of a microarray experiment. Analysis
methods identify probes and these probes are converted into
gene names by some annotation method. A failure at the level
of annotation is often a cause for later questioning the analysis
method. Of more concern is the fact that most microarray
papers only mention the gene name. If the names are
wrong, it creates difficulty for those who would later attempt
to reproduce the results in alternative formats. This ‘poor
reproducibility’ is the reason that validation is often required
following microarray experiments. But validation will only be
successful if one carefully evaluates what must be validated.
The simplest case to consider is where several splice variants
can be produced from a genetic locus and a spot on an array
detects all variants. One must consider whether all transcripts,
as a collective group, caused a detected change, or whether a
single splice variant was responsible for the change. The for-
mer case might indicate a change in the initiation of transcrip-
tion, while the latter case argues for splicing factors or
transcript stability as the cause. Too often one assumes that
the cause was transcriptional activation and that all methods
e31 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 3 PAGE 6 OF 9
are equivalent for measuring this phenomenon. The proper
identification of the targets for each probe and the careful
examination of the performance of multiple-related probes
can provide more information about the events occurring
within the experimental system. This kind of care with
gene identification can lead to more productive follow-up
experimentation and greatly improve the verification of
microarray results.
Improper identification comes from several sources. Not
knowing the actual sequence placed on a spot makes proper
identification impossible (10). Even when the sequence is
known, identification can be uncertain, as many poorly iden-
tified sequences have been deposited in GenBank. Further-
more, the assumption that a probe detects only one
sequence leads to errors. If multiple transcripts can bind to
a spot but only one name is given, then sometimes the iden-
tification will be correct and sometimes it will be wrong. This
problem might be overcome by evaluating the performance of
several related probes to discern which gene has changed. But
this is not done when one assumes that each spot corresponds

This probeset may detect an unusual
splice variant, alternate termination site,
or extended transcript of core promoter
element binding protein. It is also a
chimeric probeset with some of the
probes detecting a locus 1.7 Mb away
on chromosome 10

to a single gene or that duplicate probes are equivalent.
Finally, the complexity of the human genome is often ignored
when deciding what a probe has detected. Splice variants and
overlapping transcripts are usually ignored when naming spots
and the user of the array often grabs the first sequence they find
with the same name as that designated for the spot. Most of
these problems are created by the desire to handle thousands of
measurements quickly and efficiently. This is the ultimate
source of error in a microarray experiment: compromising
scientific accuracy for speed and ease of use.
We have re-identified the probes on the Affymetrix U133
plus 2.0 array. We have done this based on the sequence of the
probes. In redefining the genes detected, we have removed two
sources of error in the identification of probes on a microarray,
and made it possible to do the proper analysis required to
remove other sources of misidentification. The most important
attribute of our identification of the U133 plus 2.0 probesets is
that we indicate when the identification is uncertain. We know
very little about the human genome and how it leads to a
functional organism. Therefore, most of the identifications
have a degree of uncertainty. However, we have only flagged
genes for specific reasons. The possible reasons include the
following: probesets that correspond to a gene where splice
variants are known; probesets that recognize more than one
gene transcribed from different loci; chimeric probesets where
some of the probes detect one gene and some of the probes
detect a different gene or something not found in the human
genome; probesets where some or all of the probes detect a
repetitive element within the genome; and probesets that
detect a GenBank sequence that is not yet well characterized
by the scientific community including ESTs and hypothetical
sequences.
When a probeset is flagged as uncertain more care is
required in defining the gene and planning follow-up experi-
ments. We recommend a thorough in silico analysis of the
gene or genes identified by such probesets. We also recom-
mend that the investigator go back to the original data and
evaluate the performance of all related probesets. If three spots
all detect the same thing and only one spot has changed during
the experiment, then this change is probably noise. More
importantly, if the three similar probesets detect different
splice variants and only one has changed then one has more
information about how the change might have occurred, what
protein might be produced, and how to best verify the phe-
nomenon. In our identification, simple flags indicate the need
for such analysis. We additionally report the related probesets
that might help one to identify the affected gene. The example
we showed of the interferon alpha gene family illustrates that
many of the probesets should be considered as groups, not as
individuals.
At this point much of this analysis must be done by hand.
This is a daunting prospect when one is faced with a list
containing hundreds of probesets. The bioinformatics com-
munity can help with this effort in a number of ways. Simple
programs can be designed to retrieve data from related probes
once a probe is identified by an analysis method. More
involved programs might contain the necessary rules for
evaluating a family of probesets and draw the appropriate
conclusions from the experimental data. Alternatively, it is
possible to redefine the probes that comprise a probeset so
that better evaluations could be done for specific transcripts.
Ultimately, many of these problems can be reduced by using
this information to design better probes.
The results of our analysis indicate that there are additional
problems that might influence the analysis of a probeset. Some
probes do not detect anything and would be expected to yield
unusually low hybridization signals. Others detect highly
repetitive elements found in many transcripts and are expected
to give unusually high hybridization signals at all times. Out-
lier signal on even one probe can influence the calculations
used to define the metrics of ‘detection’, ‘signal’ and ‘change’.
Therefore, the interpretation of any experimental outcome
should be done with an understanding of this complicating
factor. At present, all algorithms used to calculate information
from a probeset assume that all probes within the set detect the
same gene. This analysis indicates that that is not always the
case. At present, the uninformative probes could be masked
from the analysis. In the future, the problematic probes could
be replaced with more informative probes.
Many people try to develop a big picture view of their
microarray results. They do this by tapping into information
that has been associated with gene names. Array results are
often sorted according to the gene ontologies assigned to the
protein products or assigned to cellular pathways based on the
function of the protein. This practice should be re-evaluated.
Given that so many of the probesets detect multiple transcripts,
is it really correct to select one gene name and assume that that
was the one affected by the change observed on an array?
Furthermore, many of these ontologies do not accurately rep-
resent the subtle differences in the behavior of the proteins
encoded by transcriptional variants. Even though it requires
more work, we believe that the effort should be spent on
accurately identifying the targets detected in a microarray
experiment before attempting to get a big picture view of
the data.
