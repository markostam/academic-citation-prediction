ABSTRACT
Systematic identification of binding partners for
modular domains such as Src homology 2 (SH2) is
important for understanding the biological function
of the corresponding SH2 proteins. We have devel-
oped a worldwide web-accessible computer pro-
gram dubbed SMALI for scoring matrix-assisted
ligand identification for SH2 domains and other
signaling modules. The current version of SMALI
harbors 76 unique scoring matrices for SH2 domains
derived from screening oriented peptide array
libraries. These scoring matrices are used to
search a protein database for short peptides pre-
ferred by an SH2 domain. An experimentally deter-
mined cut-off value is used to normalize an SMALI
score, therefore allowing for direct comparison in
peptide-binding potential for different SH2 domains.
SMALI employs distinct scoring matrices from
Scansite, a popular motif-scanning program.
Moreover, SMALI contains built-in filters for phos-
phoproteins, Gene Ontology (GO) correlation and
colocalization of subject and query proteins.
Compared to Scansite, SMALI exhibited improved
accuracy in identifying binding peptides for SH2
domains. Applying SMALI to a group of SH2
domains identified hundreds of interactions that
overlap significantly with known networks mediated
by the corresponding SH2 proteins, suggesting
SMALI is a useful tool for facile identification of
signaling networks mediated by modular domains
that recognize short linear peptide motifs.
INTRODUCTION
Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a central paradigm
in signal transduction and it regulates almost all essential
cellular functions such as proliferation, diﬀerentiation,
migration and survival (1). Deregulated phosphorylation
of proteins is often associated with an abnormal state of a
cell and can result in malignant transformation (2). The
human genome encodes 518 protein kinases, of which 90
are tyrosine kinases and another 43 are tyrosine kinase-
like (3). By adding a phosphate moiety to the hydroxyl
group of a Tyr residue, protein-tyrosine kinases can
directly modulate the activity of the target protein, alter its
subcellular localization and/or promote the formation of
speciﬁc signaling complexes. The latter function of
tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by protein modules,
such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-
binding (PTB) domains, which recognize pTyr-containing
peptides (4,5). Binding of an SH2 or a PTB domain to a
phosphotyrosyl sequence provides a general mechanism
for the formation of speciﬁc protein complexes in
intracellular signal transduction, which serves to propa-
gate and regulate a signal emanated from a protein-
tyrosine kinase.
The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in normal
cellular function is also highlighted by the great number of
SH2 and PTB domains identiﬁed in metazoa (6,7). The
human genome encodes 120 SH2 domains distributed in
110 distinct proteins, which constitutes the largest family
of modular domains capable of recognizing a phospho-
tyrosine (7). Although the pTyr residue is indispensable
for SH2-binding in the majority of cases (8), the speciﬁcity
of a given SH2 domain is typically determined by a few
residues C-terminal to the pTyr (5). Identifying the speciﬁc

phosphotyrosyl peptide motif recognized by an SH2
domain is a key to understand the function of the
corresponding SH2-containing protein. On a larger scale,
comprehensive knowledge about the speciﬁcity of all
mammalian SH2 and PTB domains would make it possible
to gauge, in principle, the phosphotyrosine cellular signal-
ing network mediated by these domains. As a ﬁrst step
towards this lofty goal, we recently determined the
phosphotyrosyl motifs selected, respectively, by 76
human SH2 domains using an oriented peptide array
library (OPAL) approach (13). The parent library consisted
of the degenerated sequence XX-pY-XXXX, where
X denotes a mixture of 19 naturally occurring amino
acids except Cys, and screening of the OPAL yielded
selectivity for positions 2 to +4 with respect to the pTyr.
This speciﬁcity information is necessary for future explora-
tion of SH2 domain function and for the identiﬁcation of
SH2-mediated protein–protein interactions. To take
advantage of the OPAL screen data, we generated
position-speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSM) for 76 SH2
domains and developed a world-wide web-based (WWW)
computer program called scoring matrix-assisted ligand
identiﬁcation (SMALI) for facile identiﬁcation of linear
peptides preferred by an SH2 domain from searching a
protein database. Although SMALI is similar to the motif-
scanning method, Scansite, developed by Yaﬀe, Cantley
and colleagues (9), SMALI contains PSSMs for 76 SH2
domains in contrast to 14 employed by the latter.
Moreover, an SMALI PSSM incorporates selectivity
information for six positions (from 2 to +4 relative to
the pTyr) of a peptide, whereas most of the PSSMs for SH2
domains used in Scansite were derived from earlier studies
that addressed the selectivity from pTyr+1 through
pTyr+3 (10,11). To restrict the return from a search to
target proteins that have a high probability to be
physiologically relevant, SMALI contains an optional
ﬁlter for phosphorylated peptides. The physiological
relevance of a predicted interaction may be further
enhanced by applying two additional ﬁlters namely signal
transduction and subcellular colocalizations (of the query
and subject proteins). These novel features make SMALI a
useful approach besides Scansite to identify phospho-
tyrosine-mediated binding events. Here, we describe the
usage of the SMALI program and an experimental
approach by which to determine the cut-oﬀ value for a
prediction. We evaluated the performance of SMALI
against Scansite for predicting binding peptides for the
NCK, CRK and FGR SH2 domains, and applied SMALI
to a representative group of 12 SH2 domains in order to
identify the corresponding protein–protein interaction
(PPI) network. The SMALI-derived PPI network overlaps
signiﬁcantly with known interactions for these SH2-
containing proteins, suggesting that SMALI can recapitu-
late known interactions and identify novel PPIs. The
SMALI program, accessible via http://lilab.uwo.ca/
SMALI.htm, is frequently updated to include more
modular interaction domains and the corresponding
PSSMs. To maximize the usage of these matrices, we are
also making them available to other bioinformatic pro-
grams such as the Scansite and NetPhorest (Linding et al.
unpublished results) that aim at identifying protein-binding
events and/or signaling pathways according to the principle
of domain-short linear motif recognition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Derivation of position-specific scoring matrices
The OPAL membrane was scanned and quantiﬁed on a
BioRad FluoroImager. A selectivity value Xi, p is assigned
to each amino acid i at position p in the peptide based on
an OPAL result, by subtracting the background signal of
the membrane from each data spot. The Xi, p is used to
calculate a score Si, p, deﬁned as an element of the query
SH2 domain scoring matrix, by the formula Si, p ¼
Ri, pðlog2N ð
PN
i¼ 1Ri, plog2Ri, pÞÞ, where N is the
number of residue types in the OPAL array (N=19
except for Cys) and Ri, p ¼ Xi, p=
PN
i¼ 1 Xi, p. In this formula,
the term log2N ð
PN
i¼1 Ri, plog2Ri, pÞ represents infor-
mation content of all residues at position p and Si, p
denotes information content of residue i at this position.
Information content of Cys, which was not included in the
OPAL, is set equal to the mean Si, p value at a given
position. A peptide score Sm, or SMALI score, is
calculated using the formula Sm ¼
P4
p¼2 Si, p(P 6¼ 0),
assuming entropy independence between positions. A
peptide with a larger SMALI score is considered to have
a greater propensity for binding to the query SH2 domain.
A relative score is deﬁned as the ratio of SMALI score
over a cut-oﬀ value, corresponding to the score at that
separates the top 4.5% of peptides from the remaining
Tyr-containing peptides taken from all human proteins in
the Swiss-Prot database, with the exception of BRDG1
SH2 (3.5%) and GRB2 SH2 (5.5%).
Peptide array synthesis and probing
Peptide arrays were synthesized following established
protocols (12). To determine the ability of the peptides
on the array to bind an SH2 domain, the SH2 domain was
expressed as GST-fusion and puriﬁed to homogeneity on a
glutathione aﬃnity column and fast-performance liquid
chromatography (FPLC) column. The same procedures
used for OPAL screening (13) was used to probe the array
for binding to the GST-SH2 protein (applied at 1 mM).
Finally, the peptide array was scanned and quantiﬁed on a
BioRad FluoroImager and the background signal was
subtracted from each peptide spot.
Differentiation of binding and nonbinding peptides
in an array
While in most cases the spot value will provide the
quantitative information about the strength of binding for
a peptide on the array, the line between binding and
nonbinding peptides becomes blurred when the binding
signal is weak. We used the distribution pattern on spot
values on an array to determine a cut-oﬀ value by which to
diﬀerentiate binding from nonbinding peptides. When the
numbers of binding and nonbinding peptides are compar-
able, the distribution of spot values follows a bimodal
pattern where the peak at a large spot value represents
binding, while the peak at the small value represents
3264 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 10
nonbinding peptides. In this case, the transition point
between the two peaks is selected as the cut-oﬀ. When the
signals are extremely biased, the distribution of spot
values can be unimodal, and therefore no apparent
transition is detected. This is the case with the BRDG1
SH2 peptide array for which an overwhelming number of
peptides showed binding. In this case, we deﬁne a
nonbinding peptide as one with a spot value smaller
than the average spot value across the entire array
subtracted by 1.5 SD. Based on the earlier deﬁnition,
peptides with spot values >1.3 are considered binding
peptides for the BRDG1 SH2 domain (Table S1), >1.8 for
the GRB2 SH2 (Table S2), >0.8 for NCK SH2 (Table S3),
>0.7 for CRK SH2 (Table S4) and >0.4 for FGR SH2
(Table S5). The ﬁve peptide arrays together contained 16
known binding peptides for diﬀerent SH2 domains. All
are correctly classiﬁed, suggesting the classiﬁcation
scheme outline above is a reasonable representation of
the true binding data.
RESULTS
Overview of the SMALI program
The derivation of PSSM based on the experimental data
from OPAL screens was described elsewhere (13). Brieﬂy,
the OPAL-binding proﬁle for an SH2 domain was
obtained and quantiﬁed for signal strength at each peptide
spot on the array (Figure 1A). The information-entropy
algorithm was applied to the signals to generate the
corresponding scoring matrix (Figure 1B). The current
version of the SMALI program includes two modules,
peptide scan and domain scan. The peptide scan module is
used to identify short peptides that have a high propensity
to bind a modular interaction domain such as SH2. In
contrast, the domain scan module is used to identify
domains that are preferred by a query protein. To predict
peptide ligands for a query SH2 domain, all Tyr-containing
peptides in the Swiss-Prot database (14) are retrieved and
scored using PSSM for that SH2 domain. Peptides are
ranked in a descending order based on the SMALI scores,
and a peptide with a larger score is considered to have a
greater tendency to bind the query SH2 domain. Inside the
peptide scan module, a user could select one of the 76 SH2
domains currently covered by the SMALI site. After
selecting a protein database (the Swiss-Prot database is
used as a default in SMALI), one can choose to run the
program without ﬁlters or with ﬁlters to restrict the
proteins to be included in the output ﬁle (Figure 1D).
Because the Swiss-Prot database contains over 200 000
tyrosines from human proteins, it is necessary to limit the
output size of a SMALI prediction by parsing the output
through a number of ﬁlters.
Three ﬁlters were therefore implemented that may be
used individually or in combination. The ‘phosphoryla-
tion potential’ ﬁlter selects only peptides whose phosphor-
ylation has been experimentally veriﬁed. This information
is taken directly from the databases PhosphoSite (15) and
Phospho.ELM (16). Because SH2 domains bind speciﬁ-
cally to pTyr-containing sequences, those that are not
phosphorylated on Tyr are unlikely to be of physiological
relevance even when they produce large SMALI scores.
The application of phosphorylation ﬁlter reduces the
candidate peptides from over 200 000 to 8000 (15). The
second ﬁlter, signaling transduction, limits proteins
returned from a search to those involved in signal
transduction processes. Because most SH2 domains are
involved in cellular signal transduction, the identiﬁcation
of signaling proteins that bind to SH2 domains may have
a greater potential to be physiologically relevant.
Signaling proteins are identiﬁed according to the PFAM
domain database and Gene Ontology (GO) terms (17–19).
Speciﬁcally, a subject is classiﬁed as a signaling protein if it
contains one or more of the 116 signaling domains deﬁned
in the PFAM and/or SMART databases (20,21), or if it is
annotated with one or more of the following GO terms or
their child terms: signal transduction, signal transducer
activity, protein kinase activity, phosphoprotein phospha-
tase activity and protein amino acid dephosphorylation.
The third ﬁlter is created to keep in an output only those
proteins that colocalize with the query SH2 protein in
speciﬁc subcellular compartments as annotated in Swiss-
Prot. The following compartments are used with this ﬁlter:
(i) cytoplasm, (ii) nucleus, (iii) mitochondrion, (iv) golgi
apparatus, (v) endoplasmic reticulum and (vi) endosome.
Approximately 34% of human proteins in Swiss-Prot are
annotated with a role in signal transduction, while 71%
assigned to speciﬁc cellular compartments. To date, 63
SH2 domain-containing proteins have been annotated by
subcellular localization, some of which are identiﬁed in
more than one cellular compartment (e.g. ABL1 exists in
either cytoplasm or nucleus). In cases where diﬀerent
regions of a protein are assigned to distinct subcellular
locations (i.e. membrane proteins), the region containing
the putative binding site(s) for the query SH2 is
considered. For instance, the cytoplasmic region (residues
323–428) of the membrane protein NACHR alpha 10
(Swiss-Prot ID: Q9GZZ6) is scanned if a query SH2 is
annotated with cytoplasmic localization.
Typical output format of the peptide scan module is
shown in Figure 1E. The output size can be set by a user to
100, 250 or 500. The ﬁrst two columns of the output ﬁle
report a SMALI score of the peptide target and its relative
score calculated by normalizing the raw SMALI score
against a cut-oﬀ value (deﬁned as the score corresponding
to the top 4.5% of peptides ranked by SMALI, see
subsequent sections for detail). A relative score of >1.0
suggests a strong potential for binding. The output ﬁle
also includes information about the peptide sequence, the
position of Tyr residue in the subject protein, gene name,
protein name, GeneBank identiﬁcation (ID), Swiss-Prot
ID, molecular weight of the subject protein and localiza-
tions if available. To match the prediction with known
interactions, the last two columns of the output list
interactions between the query and subject proteins that
have been curated in PPI databases or in domain-peptide
interaction databases such as Phospho.Elm (16). Two PPI
databases are currently linked to SMALI: the IntAct
database where interactions are derived from experiments
(22,23), and the I2D database that combines literature-
derived human PPIs with those inferred from other species
(24). IntAct contains over 400 interactions that may
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 10 3265
involve SH2 domains and the I2D collects 2000 potential
SH2-mediated interactions. The conﬁdence level of an SH2
domain-ligand interaction predicted by SMALI is greater if
the corresponding PPI is also listed in a database.
In contrast to the peptide scan module that identify
peptide targets for a query SH2 domain/protein, the
domain scan module of SMALI is used to identify SH2
domains preferred by a query protein that harbors one or
more Tyr phosphorylation sites. A query protein can be
speciﬁed by its Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL ID or its complete or
partial sequence entered in FASTA format in the space
provided (Figure 2A). Prior to activate a search, the user
has the option of selecting one, a subgroup or all SH2
domains (default). The output ﬁle of a domain scan lists
the query protein sequence with all tyrosine residues
highlighted. In a separate panel, the Tyr-containing
peptides are listed along with a group of SH2 domains
preferred by them (Figure 2B). The numbers in the
parenthesis besides an SH2 domain denotes its relative
SMALI score for a given Tyr site. An SH2 domain with a
larger relative score has a greater tendency to bind to a
Tyr site. The output ﬁle lists only those SH2 domains that
have a relative SMALI score >1.0 (see next section for the
derivation of relative SMALI score).

Experimental determination of SMALI cut-off values
While it is reasonable to assume that a peptide with a larger
SMALI score has a greater tendency to bind a query SH2
domain, this assumption has to be veriﬁed experimentally.
In addition, a cut-oﬀ value is needed to limit the size of the
output ﬁle and to identify interactions that have a high
probability to occur. Moreover, a given peptide may
produce diﬀerent SMALI scores for diﬀerent SH2
domains, and it would be impossible to determine which
SH2 domain is preferred by the peptide based on the raw
SMALI scores. Therefore, it is necessary to derive a relative
SMALI score that allows for direct comparison between
SH2 domains. To this end, we applied SMALI to predict
peptide ligands for the BRDG1 and GRB2 SH2 domains,
respectively and synthesized these peptides in an array
format to test their binding to the two SH2 domains. These
two SH2 domains represent two extreme cases since few
physiological targets have been identiﬁed for the BRDG1
SH2 domain (25), whereas a dozen or so have been
characterized for the GRB2 SH2 domain. To gauge the
repertoire of peptides that potentially bind the BRDG1
SH2 domain, we searched the Swiss-Prot human protein
database and retrieved1488 peptides ranked in the top 5%
by SMALI (Table S1). These peptides were then
synthesized as an array and screened for binding to the
puriﬁed BRDG1 SH2 domain following established
procedures (12,13). As shown in Figure 3A, while the
majority of peptides belonging to the top two-thirds of list
displayed binding to the BRDG1 SH2 domain, only a small
fraction of the bottom third exhibited binding, suggesting
that the ability of a peptide to bind BRDG1 SH2 domain
correlates grossly with the raw SMALI score. Because only
a small fraction of all Tyr residues contained in the Swiss-
Prot database is expected to be phosphorylated in vivo, we
performed a more targeted binding assay for the GRB2
SH2 domain on a set of peptides selected from the
Phosphosite database. We selected a total of 720 peptides
of which 360 corresponded to the peptides with large
SMALI scores (upper half in Figure 3B) and the remaining
360 were taken randomly from the Phosphosite database
(Table S2). While most peptides predicted by SMALI
indeed exhibited binding to the GRB2 SH2 domain, only a
small fraction of the randomly chosen peptides (lower half
in Figure 3B) showed detectable binding.
To correlate the peptide array results with the SMALI
score, we calculated the experimentally observed ‘hit-rates’
of peptide-domain interactions and graphed them against
the corresponding SMALI scores (at 0.1 or 0.2 intervals).
It is apparent from Figure 3C and D that a larger SMALI

deﬁned as the percentage of binding peptides, at a given SMALI score range (in increments of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively for C and D). (E and F) An
optimal SMALI cut-oﬀ value is arbitrarily deﬁned as the SMALI score that produces the greatest F-measure. F-measure=2 precision recall/
(precision+recall), where precision=binding peptides correctly predicted/binding peptides predicted and recall=binding peptides correctly
predicted/real binding peptides. For the BRDG1 SH2 domain, the SMALI score 1.4 produced the largest F-measure 0.84 (E). Coincidently, this
SMALI value corresponds to a hit-rate of 50%. For the GRB2 SH2 domain, the cut-oﬀ SMALI score is 1.6. (F and G) Distribution of all Tyr-
containing peptides (total 203 494) in Swiss-Prot human database according to SMALI scores calculated using PSSM for BRDG1 (G) or the GRB2
SH2 (H) domain. The SMALI cut-oﬀ of 1.4 for the BRDG1 SH2 domain corresponds to the top 3.5% scoring peptides located to the right of the
cut-oﬀ value (G). For GRB2 SH2, the cut-oﬀ corresponds to the top 5.5% peptides ranked according to SMALI.
3268 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 10
score generally corresponds to a greater hit rate for either
the BRDG1 or the GRB2 SH2 domain. To generate a cut-
oﬀ value for SMALI prediction, we next calculated the
F-measure and plotted it against the SMALI score
(Figure 3E and F). We arbitrarily deﬁned a SMALI cut-
oﬀ as the score corresponding to the greatest F-measure
value, which represents the best compromise between
precision of prediction and the rate of recall. For the
BRDG1 SH2 domain, the cut-oﬀ of 1.4 corresponds to
peptides ranked in the top 3.5% by SMALI (Figure 3G).
In the peptide screening, 82% of the peptides with the
score >1.4 are true binders. In a previous study, we
synthesized 22 peptides and measured their respective
dissociation constants (Kd) for the BRDG1 SH2 domain
in solution (13). Half of these peptides have a SMALI
score >1.4, whereas the remaining half has scores below
the cut-oﬀ. For the ﬁrst half, 10 (or 91%) displayed strong
binding in solution. In contrast, 9 (or 82%) of the second
group of peptides exhibited weak or no binding to the
BRDG1 SH2 domain. These results suggest that the cut-
oﬀ is suitable for identifying authentic binding partners
for BRDG1.
Analysis of the F-measure led to a SMALI cut-oﬀ value
of 1.65 for the GRB2 SH2 domain, which corresponds to
the top 5.5% of all Tyr-containing peptides collected in
the Swiss-Prot human protein database (Figure 3H).
Interestingly, all 13 known ligands of the GRB2 SH2
domain have scores greater than the cut-oﬀ, were correctly
identiﬁed by SMALI, and showed strong binding in the
peptide array screen (Table 1). Therefore, the experimen-
tally determined cut-oﬀ value is suitable for identifying
physiological binding partners for GRB2.
While in principle one could carry out similar experi-
ments for the remaining SH2 domains in order to
determine the corresponding cut-oﬀ values, the amount
of work involved would be enormous. Nevertheless, from
the binding data obtained for the BRDG1 and GRB2 SH2
domain, it is reasonable to assume that the top 4.5%
(average cut-oﬀ value for the BRDG1 and GRB2 SH2
domains) of peptides ranked by SMALI have a high
probability to bind a query SH2 domain. We have
therefore set the SMALI score that separate the top
4.5% of peptides from the remainder (except for the
BRDG1 and GRB2 SH2s) as the reference point for an
SMALI prediction. The cut-oﬀ value was used as a
common denominator to normalize the raw SMALI score.
This produces the relative SMALI score listed in
Figure 1E, which serves as a measure of propensity for a
peptide to bind a query SH2 domain. A relative score of
>1.0 indicates high potential, whereas a score smaller than
1.0 indicates a low potential for binding. The assignment
of a relative SMALI score also makes it possible to
compare and rank diﬀerent SH2 domains for their
propensity to bind a given peptide ligand in the ‘domain
scan’ module of the SMALI program.
Comparison between SMALI and Scansite
Scansite is a web-based program capable of identifying
domain-binding peptides or kinase substrates using
PSSMs derived from screening peptide libraries synthe-
sized chemically or displayed on bacteriophages (26,27).
Scansite incorporates three threshold values—‘high’,
‘medium’ or ‘low’ stringency—to determine the accuracy
of prediction. For instance, a peptide is reported as a ‘high
stringency’ hit if its Sf score falls within the top 0.2% of all
peptides in the same group (i.e. Tyr-containing). Scansite
currently incorporates PSSMs for 14 SH2 domains from
ABL1, CRK, FGR, FYN, GRB2, ITK, LCK, NCK,
SRC, SHIP, SHIP, PIK3R1, PLCG1_N and PLCG1_C,
respectively. All matrices have counterparts in SMALI
except for the PLCG1_N SH2 domain.
Since both SMALI and Scansite can be used to predict
SH2–ligand interactions, we next compared their perfor-
mance in predicting targets for SH2 domains from NCK,
CRK and FGR. For each SH2 domain, the top 336
candidate peptides selected by either Scansite or SMALI
were synthesized on a membrane and tested for binding to
the SH2 domain. The sequences and ranking orders of the
peptides by either SMALI or Scansite are listed in
Tables S3–S5. Results of screening the peptide arrays
with the corresponding SH2 domain are shown in Figure 4.

40% are found real for NCK, 90% for CRK and 98% for
FGR. In contrast, 15% of peptides identiﬁed by Scansite as
binders for NCK were real, while 32 and 87% were real for
CRK and FGR SH2-binding, respectively (Table 2).
Interestingly, neither program predicted NCK SH2 ligands
with a >50% accuracy. We speculate that other factors,
such as negative selection and position-dependence, which
are not accounted for in a PSSM, may play a ‘dominant
negative’ role in some SH2–ligand interactions. We
calculated the average SMALI score of the Scansite-
predicted peptides and found it to be smaller than the
average score for the SMALI-predicted peptides. This
agrees with our observation that peptides with larger
SMALI scores have greater propensities to bind a query
SH2 domain (Table 2). Taken together, SMALI exhibited
improved accuracy than Scansite in identifying peptide
ligands for the three SH2 domains examined herein.
Nevertheless, we also observed that the combination of
the two programs identiﬁed more binding peptides for an
SH2 domain than did either alone. Therefore, the integra-
tion of SMALI and Scansite should facilitate the identiﬁca-
tion of SH2 domain–ligand interactions.
Predicting SH2 signaling network by SMALI
The determination of speciﬁcity of two-thirds of human
SH2 domains makes it possible to gauge the signaling space
involving the SH2 domain. To interrogate whether SMALI
can aid in the identiﬁcation of authentic SH2–ligand
interactions in a larger scale than described earlier, we
applied it to a group of 12 SH2 domains with the
phosphorylation ﬁlter and identiﬁed all peptides with a
relative SMALI score >1.0. These SH2 domains were
selected to represent the major speciﬁcity groups I (motif
poYxxj, where x denotes a hydrophilic residue and j is a
hydrophobic residue) and II (motif poYxxj, where
x denotes any residue) (13). The corresponding
SH2-containing proteins have also been studied extensively
by either conventional or proteomic approaches such that
a number of interactions involving them have been
reported in the literature. As seen in Table 3, each SH2
domain could potentially interact with hundreds of target
proteins, suggesting that other factors such as protein
expression and localization must play a role in dictating
which interactions occur in vivo. To assess the accuracy
of the prediction, we examined the overlap between the
predicted interactions and those curated in comprehensive
PPI databases such as I2D (24) and IntAct (22). We found
that the overlap between the predicted and known
interactions ranging from 20.3% for Fyn to 49.3% for
PIK3. This overlap is signiﬁcantly greater than expected by
chance (P< 0.006), conﬁrming that SMALI is an eﬃcient
method to recapitulate authentic SH2–target interactions.
The overlap would have been more extensive if we had
knowledge on which interactions listed in a PPI database
indeed involve an SH2 domain and discounted those that
are not directly mediated by the query SH2 domain. It
should also be noted that the intersection between the PPI
space and corresponding SMALI space for a given SH2
protein is rather small (with the exception of Grb2,
Table 3), suggesting that many authentic SH2–target
interactions awaits identiﬁcation or experimental
validation.
DISCUSSION
It is clear from comparative genomic analyses that
signaling domains have undergone a drastic expansion in
multicellular organisms (28,29). Taking the SH2 domain
for example, in contrast to yeast that contains no functional
SH2 domain, a human cell harbors over a hundred such
domains. The same pattern of domain expansion is also
observed for other signaling modules such as SH3, PTB
and PDZ, to name just a few. The abundance of these
interaction modules in the human genome suggests that
they play important roles in regulating normal cellular
function (30). Because a number of prevalent signaling
domains promote PPIs by binding to short linear motifs
present in other proteins, delineating the speciﬁcity of these
Figure 4. Validation of peptide ligands for the SH2 domains of CRK
(A), NCK (B) and FGR (C), respectively as identiﬁed by SMALI

SH2 domain, a total of 336 peptides were examined, of which the ﬁrst
168 was identiﬁed as top binders by SMALI and the last 168 by the
Scansite. The sequences of the peptides and their respective ranking
orders on SMALI or Scansite are provided in Tables S3–S5. See also

domains provides an eﬀective means to decipher the
multitude of protein interactions mediated by them.
Additionally, the speciﬁcity information allows for ready
identiﬁcation of potential binding partners for an interac-
tion domain. In this regard, Scansite was developed to
capitalize on the knowledge of domain and kinase
speciﬁcity, and has become an essential tool in the toolbox
of signal transduction (26,27). The SMALI method
described herein utilizes the same principles as those
guided the Scansite, but is distinguishable from the latter
in the following. First, the current version of SMALI
contains speciﬁcity information and the corresponding
scoring matrices for 76 human SH2 domains, making it
possible now to predict phosphotyrosine peptide–SH2
domain interactions at or near proteome scale. The origin
of the PSSMs (13) dictates that SMALI is dedicated to the
prediction of human or other PPIs. Second, the scoring
matrices employed by SMALI contain experimentally
deﬁned selectivity information for positions 2 through
+4with respect to the invariant pTyr. In comparison, most
SH2matrices employed by Scansite contain experimentally
derived selectivity information on the C-terminal residues
only (10,11). Although we have not subjected it to rigorous
tests yet, the inclusion of N-terminal selectivity may
enhance the accuracy of prediction since it allows distinc-
tions to be made between two peptides that may contain an
identical C-terminal sequence. Moreover, some SH2
domains, including those from BRDG1, PLCg1 and
SHP2, have shown selectivity beyond P+3. Third,
SMALI is imbedded with several ﬁlters to limit the return
from a search to proteins that are most likely to be of
physiologically relevance. Of particular usage is the
phosphorylation ﬁlter, since it limits the output to proteins
whose phosphorylation has been experimentally veriﬁed.
Fourth, the threshold value for a SMALI prediction is
inferred from experiments and the resulting normalized
SMALI score can be used as a direct measure of binding
propensity of a peptide to a query SH2 domain. The
normalized propensity score also eliminates the diﬀerence
in the range of SMALI scores for diﬀerent SH2 domains
and allow for direct comparison of two SH2 domains for
propensity to bind a given peptide.
A useful bioinformatic program should not only be
capable of recapitulating known knowledge but also
predict novel biology. We have put SMALI to rigorous
tests on both functions. SMALI faithfully recapitulated all
known interactions mediated by the GRB2 SH2 domain
and predicted novel interactions involving the BRDG1
SH2 domain (12). Our network analysis on a set of 12 SH2
domains also revealed a signiﬁcant overlap between
SMALI predicted SH2–ligand interactions and known
interactions that involve the corresponding SH2 proteins.
Since the speciﬁcity of the SH2 domain is tightly coupled
to the speciﬁcity of tyrosine kinases (31), SMALI may
play a role in identifying signaling networks initiated by
protein-tyrosine kinases. In this regard, we attempted to
identify a kinase-SH2 signaling network involving a group
of SH2 domains by combining SMALI with NetworKIN
(32), a web-based program that was developed recently to
identify phosphorylation sites and the corresponding
kinases based on linear motif-recognition and network
context (32,33). The predicted PTK–substrate–SH2 net-
work not only recapitulates many known interactions, but
reveals a number of novel signaling pathways (Li and Li,
unpublished data). This exercise suggests that by combin-
ing SMALI with existing programs on kinase speciﬁcity
and/or network analysis, novel signaling pathways can be
uncovered.

To make full use of the OPAL-derived scoring matrices,
we have made them available to other bioinformatic
programs such as NetPhorest (Linding et al. unpublished
data). We will also make our matrices available to Scansite
and related programs that predict PPIs based on linear
motifs. Moreover, the SMALI site will be updated
regularly to include more scoring matrices derived from
OPAL or other experiments. Because the OPAL approach
can be applied in principle to any modular domains,
including kinases and phosphatases that recognize short
linear peptide motifs, we anticipate SMALI will be
expanded to the prediction of interactions mediated by a
variety of interaction domains and for the identiﬁcation of
kinase substrates in a similar manner as described here.
Despite the usefulness of SMALI or Scansite in identifying
peptide ligands for an SH2 domain, it should be realized
that the physiological relevance of a prediction remains to
be established by experiments. An in vitro binding event
does not always correspond to an in vivo interaction
because other factors such as protein expression, phos-
phorylation, localization and/or scaﬀolding may dictate
whether a given interaction will indeed occur in a cell.
