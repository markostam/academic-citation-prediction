ABSTRACT
We have collected over half a million splice sites
from five species—Homo sapiens, Mus musculus,
Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans
and Arabidopsis thaliana—and classified them into
four subtypes: U2-type GT–AG and GC–AG and
U12-type GT–AG and AT–AC. We have also found
new examples of rare splice-site categories, such
as U12-type introns without canonical borders,
and U2-dependent AT–AC introns. The splice-site
sequences and several tools to explore them are
available on a public website (SpliceRack). For the
U12-type introns, we find several features conserved
across species, as well as a clustering of these
introns on genes. Using the information content of
the splice-site motifs, and the phylogenetic distance
between them, we identify: (i) a higher degree of
conservation in the exonic portion of the U2-type
splice sites in more complex organisms; (ii) conser-
vation of exonic nucleotides for U12-type splice
sites; (iii) divergent evolution of C.elegans 30
splice sites (30ss) and (iv) distinct evolutionary
histories of 50 and 30ss. Our study proves that the
identification of broad patterns in naturally-occurring
splice sites, through the analysis of genomic data-
sets, provides mechanistic and evolutionary insights
into pre-mRNA splicing.
INTRODUCTION
Pre-mRNA splicing is a nuclear process that is conserved
across eukaryotes (1). This process involves the recognition
of exon–intron junctions by the spliceosome, and intron exci-
sion through a two-step transesterification reaction (2,3). The
spliceosome is a large and dynamic complex assembled from
RNA and protein components, including four small nuclear
RNAs (snRNAs) and associated proteins that make up the
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) (4). The
spliceosome recognizes three conserved sequences at or near
the exon–intron boundaries, namely the 50 splice site (50ss),
the branch point sequence (BPS) and the 30ss (Figure 1). In
the first catalytic step, the 50 end of the intron is cleaved
and covalently joined to an Adenosine (A) on the BPS. In
the second catalytic step, the neighboring exons are joined
and the intron is excised as a lariat. There are at least two
classes of pre-mRNA introns, based on the splicing machiner-
ies that catalyze the reaction:
 U2 snRNP-dependent introns make up the majority of all
introns and are excised by spliceosomes containing the
U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs. These introns consist of
three subtypes, according to their terminal dinucleotides:
GT–AG, GC–AG and AT–AC introns.
 U12 snRNP-dependent introns are the minor class of
introns and are excised by spliceosomes containing U11,
U12, U4atac, U6atac and U5 snRNPs. These introns mainly
consist of two subtypes, as defined by their terminal
dinucleotides: AT–AC and GT–AG introns. In addition,
a small fraction of the U12-type introns exhibit other
terminal dinucleotides (5–7).
Whereas U2-type introns have been found in virtually all
eukaryotes (1) and comprise the vast majority of the splice
sites found in any organism, U12-type introns have only
been identified in vertebrates, insects, jellyfish and plants (8).
U2-type intron splicing initially involves base pairing of U1
snRNA to the 50ss and U2 snRNA to the BPS (2) (Figure 1).
The base pairing of U2 snRNA to the BPS is facilitated by
the binding of the large subunit of the U2 Auxiliary Factor
(U2AF65) to the poly-pyrimidine tract (PPT) located imme-
diately upstream of the intron 30 terminus, and binding of
the small subunit (U2AF35) to the 30 terminal AG dinucleo-
tide of the intron (9,10). Following the initial recognition
of the splice sites by the U1 and U2 snRNPs, the U4/U6/U5
tri-snRNP is recruited to the splice site leading to the two
catalytic steps of splicing (11).

In U12-type introns, the roles of U1, U2, U4 and U6
snRNPs in U2-type introns are replaced by the U11, U12,
U4atac and U6atac snRNPs, respectively (12–14). The over-
all similarity in the predicted secondary structure between
analogous U2- and U12-type snRNAs suggests that the
spliceosome rearrangements during catalysis are conserved
between the two spliceosomes (15,16).
The 50ss, 30ss and BPS elements conform to specific
consensus sequences as determined by the alignment of
splice-site compilations (8,17–24). The U2-type splicing sig-
nals have highly degenerate sequence motifs; many different
sequences can function as U2-type splice sites. In contrast,
U12-type 50ss and the BPS, which lies close to the 30 end
of the intron, are highly conserved (22,25). In most U2-type
cases, the PPT is located immediately upstream of the AG but
there are examples in alternatively spliced exons in Droso-
phila melanogaster with a longer PPT–AG distance (26), or
even with the PPT placed downstream of the AG (27). Fur-
thermore, the mammalian U2-type BPS can also be located
very far (>100 nt) from the intron–exon junction sequence
(28). U12-type introns also lack an obvious PPT at the 30ss.
Historically, splice sites are ranked, based on compilations
of splice sites (19,20,29,30). However, none of these ranking
schemes accurately identify the bona fide splice sites (31–33).
In addition, alternative splicing, involving the choice of
competing splice sites, is not amenable to an analysis based
solely on splice sites (34).
In order to identify common and distinguishing features in
each splice-site type, we have collected and analyzed a com-
prehensive set of naturally-occurring splice sites from the gen-
omes of five model organisms: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus,
D.melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis
thaliana. Since a well-classified dataset did not exist previ-
ously, we have carefully classified the splice sites into various
categories, generating a user-friendly resource, SpliceRack
(http://katahdin.cshl.edu:9331/SpliceRack/). Using this large-
scale splice-site database, we have revisited relevant themes in
splicing, such as the frequencies of U12-type and other rare
introns, and the variations in the 50 and 30ss motifs among
the five organisms. We have also applied phylogenetic
approaches to infer the evolutionary histories of the different
splice-site subtypes. Finally, we have developed tools, avail-
able on SpliceRack, to facilitate various splice-site analyses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data collection
The idea driving the collection of data was to generate a
large, reliable dataset that would allow statistical analyses.
For this reason, sequences from RefSeq (35) were used
instead of ESTs and cDNAs and other sources of noisy
data. The RefSeq collection contains sequences with different
levels of confidence (including categories, such as reviewed,
provisional, predicted etc.).
RefSeq sequence data from NCBI (from June 2005) for
five reference genomes was collected, including the primate
H.sapiens, the rodent M.musculus, the arthropode D.melano-
gaster, the nematode C.elegans and the land plant A.thaliana.
If a splice site occurred more than once in different alterna-
tively spliced isoforms, it was considered only once in the
database, as part of one of the variants, in order to avoid
counting splice sites multiple times.
The flanking sequences at both exon–intron junctions were
extracted, 38 nt long at the 50ss (8 nt within the exon and 30
nt within the intron), and 43 nt long at the 30ss (35 nt within
the intron and 8 nt within the exon). The splice sites were
identified using annotations of the genome from GenBank.
C.elegans 30ss that are trans-spliced to spliced leader (SL)
RNAs (36) were not included in the analysis. The data,
along with lengths of introns and exons, are stored in a
relational database.
Position weight matrices (PWMs), information
content and phylogeny
Sequences at the 50 and 30 junctions for each intron were
separately aligned using the intron–exon junction as the
anchor. The alignment was used to calculate the frequencies
of nucleotides at each position. This results in a PWM that
has four rows (one for each of A, C, G and T) and the number
of columns is equal to the length of the splice-site motif. We
chose a 9 nt long motif for the 50ss (3 in the exon and 6 in the
intron) and a 14 nt long motif for the 30ss (13 in the intron and
1 in the exon). The consensus sequence for a PWM is con-
structed by choosing the nucleotide with the highest
frequency of occurrence at each position.
A log-odds (LOD) matrix was constructed from the PWM
by the usual method of taking a logarithm to base 2 of the
ratio of frequencies at each position of the matrix against a
background frequency of 0.25 for each nucleotide. Using a
different background will not change the results, but will
change the scores and thresholds. A position on a sequence
was scored by aligning it with the matrix and adding up the
entries in the matrix that correspond to the nucleotides at each
position on the sequence.
Each position on the splice site has an associated infor-
mation content that can be derived from the frequencies of
the 4 nt, using information theory (37,38). For a random vari-
able that can take on four values with four probabilities,
pi, the information content is Spilgpi. Information content
can be used to study the variability (or level of conservation)
at each position, varying from 0 (one possibility is certain)
to 2 (all possibilities are likely equal). Some papers use
2 þ Spilgpi as a measure of conservation, which just inverts
the scale (39).
A distance, d, can be derived between two PWMs, p and q,
of equal length, using a measure called the Kullback–Leibler
distance (40), a symmetrized form of which is defined as
d ¼  Si½pilgðpi/qiÞ þ qilgðqi/piÞ‚ 1

where i is the index of position on the PWM. This distance
was used to derive phylogenetic trees for the 50 and 30ss
separately, using the program Phylip (41).
Scoring a putative splice site
Given a PWM of a given splice-site type, a log-odds scoring
matrix was constructed to score the splice sites. A pseudo-
count of 0.0001 was added to avoid logarithms of zero. The
small pseudocount ensures a strong penalty for mismatches at
the exon–intron junctions.
The scores obtained by each LOD score matrix were
rescaled to fall in the 0–100 range. All positive scores, from
0 to the maximum, were rescaled to lie between 50 and 100,
and all negative scores, from the minimum score to 0, were
rescaled to lie between 0 and 50. A score close to 50 means the
background model is favored, a score close to 100 favors the
splice-site motif in question, and a score close to 0 implies
that the splice site is different from both the background
and the splice-site distribution. Finally, strongly conserved
splice sites have a bigger spread of scores, so a single
mismatch can drop the score dramatically, whereas less con-
served splice sites are more tolerant of mismatches compared
to the highest scoring sequences.
Classification of introns
PWMs were first generated for each splice-site type and BPS
using human curation. The U12-type BPS consists of an 8 nt
pyrimidine-rich sequence (approximately TTTTCCTT), fol-
lowed by two positions enriched in As and two positions
enriched in pyrimidines (C or T). The U12-type BPS requires
an A, either at positions 9 or 10 (42). In order to take this
into account, we constructed two U12-type BPS PWMs,
one with a highly conserved A at position 9 (U12-BPS-A9),
and another with a highly conserved A at position 10 (U12-
BPS-A10). A sequence was considered a good BPS if it
had a score greater than 65 for either one of the two BPS
PWMs and if it was located between 8 and 30 nt upstream
of the 30ss.
The short fragments around the exon–intron boundaries
were scored using the LOD matrices, and each intron received
a score for 50ss, 30ss and BPS for U12-type introns. The best
examples of each type, those with high 50ss scores and consis-
tent dinucleotide boundaries, were selected. For U12-type
GT–AG introns, an additional criterion for the presence of a
BPS between 8 and 38 nt upstream of the 30 end was used to
eliminate possible contaminants. The best set of introns for
each subtype was used to generate new species and splice-
site type specific PWMs, which were then used to rescore
the splice sites and reclassify them.
Intron classification was unambiguous in almost all cases,
either due to their distinctive boundaries or their 50ss scores,
with the exception of a few introns with similar scores for
U2- and U12-type GT–AG 50ss matrices. The introns that
remained unclassified were subsequently classified using
criteria described below.
Previous classification schemes (6,8,25) assumed that U12-
dependent splicing required a good BPS within 10–20 nt from
the 30 end of the intron (22), but recent data has shown this is
not always necessary (7,25,43). Thus, we used the presence
of an optimal U12-type BPS only to discriminate between
introns that could not be unambiguously classified by their
50ss scores alone. If the U12-type 50ss score was greater
than the U2-type 50ss score by more than 25 then it was
assigned the U12-type GT–AG. If the U12-type 50ss score
was greater than the U2-type 50ss score by more than 10
and the intron had a good U12-type BPS, then again it was
assigned the U12-type GT–AG. In all other cases it was
assigned the U2-type GT–AG.
The thresholds of 25 and 10 are arbitrary, but were opti-
mized by human curators to minimize the error rate, which
was estimated at <1% by manual scrutiny. The borderline
cases could be classified in either group, and their unambigu-
ous assignment will require experimental verification.
Finally, introns with a minimum 50ss score less than 50
are kept in the database, and can be accessed from the
SpliceRack website, but are not used in our analysis.
Introns with non-canonical boundaries
A few of the introns with dinucleotide boundaries that do not
fit into the canonical categories are real, and we delineate the
strategy to identify them. In general, current datasets are
biased against non-canonical splice sites, but it is possible to
gather some information on them from the RefSeq sequences,
as we show below.
To identify non-canonical U12-type introns from this
unclassified set, we chose those with good matches to the
U12-type 50ss, with a non-canonical dinucleotide at the
intron’s 30 end, and a significant number of these introns
were found (Table 1). Many of these introns have a U12-
BPS. Analogous to the scheme outlined above, those introns
without a match to the U12-type BPS were only classified as
U12-type when the score for the U12-type 50ss was >25 score
units higher than that for the U2-type 50ss. These introns
were included in the U12-type RT–RN category (where R
is a purine, and N is any nucleotide).
Some GC–AG introns revealed a strong match to the PWM
for U12-type GT–AG 50ss, except for the mismatch at posi-
tion +2. We searched for GC–AG introns with the GCATCC
motif from positions +1 to +6 of the 50ss, and found that most
of these introns had a match to the BPS at an optimal distance
from the 30ss. These introns were named U12-type GC–AG.
U2-type AT–AC introns (or AT–AC type II introns) were
identified by searching for unclassified AT–AC introns that
bear a good match to the U2-type 50ss, except for the intron’s
terminal dinucleotides. A PWM for U2-type AT–AC 50ss was
generated from the PWM for U2-type GT–AG 50 ss, by
changing the full conservation from G to A at position +1.
Only those introns with a minimal 50ss score of 75 were
reclassified as U2-type AT–AC.
Putative examples of other classes of non-canonical U2-
type introns were identified by searching for all exon–intron
boundaries with good 50 GT–AG U2-type splice sites (score
greater than 70), with a non-canonical dinucleotide boundary
at the 30 terminus of the intron and a good PPT near the 30
terminus in the intron.
Introns that could not be classified into any of the seven
categories either lack a canonical exon–intron boundary dinu-
cleotide, and/or have all 50ss scores below 40. These can be
accessed through SpliceRack. Most of these unknown splice
sites are probably due to sequencing or annotation errors in

the genome (44), as shown in previous examinations of non-
canonical splice sites (45–47). The unclassified introns in our
dataset represent a small fraction (<1.5%) of the total number
of introns.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
SpliceRack
We have created the largest compilations of splice-site
sequences to-date. The splice-site sequences for the five spe-
cies were extracted from the RefSeq collection of NCBI (35).
Introns were classified into various splice-site subtypes, based
on scoring methods derived from PWMs, as explained in the
Materials and Methods section (Table 1). Our data is publicly
available through the SpliceRack website (see http://katahdin.
cshl.edu:9331/SpliceRack/).
Tools to explore SpliceRack
SpliceRack contains sequences flanking the 50ss (38 nt long, 8
nt within the exon and 30 nt within the intron), and the 30ss
(43 nt long, 35 nt within the intron and 8 nt within the exon).
We have developed several useful tools, available on the
SpliceRack website, that allow exploration of the splice
sites and their flanking sequences. Each tool results in the
selection of a subset of splice sites. The genes containing
these splice sites can be analysed for functional and other
biases by using GObar (48), which is provided as a built-in
tool.
Retrieve splice sites by type. This tool allows users to retrieve
splice site flanking sequences by specifying one or more
splice-site subtypes, cut-off 50ss or 30ss scores, and species
(Figure 2). A similar display is obtained in the ‘Search for
genes’ tool, which allows visualization of all splice sites
within a queried gene. Introns with weak splice-site bound-
aries can be retrieved using a minimum 50ss score of 40
and a maximum of 50.
Search for patterns. This tool can be used to locate potential
protein-binding sites by searching for sequences that match
user-specified patterns in the form of regular expressions.
For example, IUPAC SNP codes as well as standard symbols,
such as ‘+’ and ‘*’ can be used. The search can be restricted
by species, splice-site type and start position, as explained on
the website.
The neural-specific splicing factor Fox-1 binds to the hex-
amer UGCAUG. In order to find introns with the hexamer in
the vicinity downstream of the 50ss, the database was queried
for U2-type GT–AG 50ss with the pattern N{13,31}TGCATG.
The N allows match to any nucleotide, the 13 and 31 ensure
that the TGCATG motif will start anywhere from position
13 on the flanking sequence, which is after the U1 binding
site, to position 31. This query results in 1221 introns. By
using the GObar function, we confirmed that the genes
containing these motifs are enriched for function in neural
tissues (49). This analysis will not find genes that have
this motif deep inside the intron.
Search for motifs. This tool is similar to the search for
patterns tool, except the patterns are now of fixed-length,
which speeds up the search. For example, to find the fre-
quency of potential stop codons (TAG,TTA,TAA) at the
last 3 nt of an exon, the search is carried out for human
U2-type GT–AG 50 ss with a motif start position of 5.
A query with the sequence TAG returns 4591 introns, while
TRA (R is a purine), representing the other two stop codons,
returns an additional 1439 introns.
Search for matrices. This tools finds matches to a user-
supplied PWM in the sequences in SpliceRack. Users can
also supply cut-off scores, and the tool calculates the
frequency of the motif’s occurrence, starting from a user-
specified position relative to the exon–intron boundary. It
also displays the rank (based on counts) of a searched motif
relative to the frequencies for all the motifs that are of the
length of the PWM and start at the user-specified start site.
Results can be limited by species, 50ss or 30ss and splice-
site type. This tool can be used to locate sequences in the
neighborhood of splice sites that can serve as protein-binding
sites.

Splice-site locator. This tool can help identify potential splice
sites in user-specified genes or sequences, using scores
derived from the PWMs in SpliceRack. When a gene name
(or sequence) is supplied along with a user-specified score
threshold, the known exon–intron boundaries as well as pre-
dicted splice sites are shown. In addition, a distribution of
counts of predicted splice sites against scores is also shown,
so that it is easy to see how the genuine splice sites compare
to the predicted splice sites. A link to the sequence in the
gene where the potential splice sites are located is also
provided.
U2-type splice sites
U2-type GT–AG and GC–AG splice sites. Of all the splice
sites we have classified, 99.6% (608 562) are of the U2-
type in the five genomes (Table 1). GC–AG introns represent
0.82% of U2-type introns in H.sapiens, 0.86% in M.musculus,
0.8% in A.thaliana, 0.45% in D.melanogaster and 0.37% in
C.elegans, indicating that more primitive organisms tend to
have fewer GC–AG introns.
GT–AG and GC–AG subtypes of U2-type introns are con-
sidered separately. Though there is no evidence that these
types are spliced by distinct mechanisms, their PWMs are
significantly different (Figure 3). The 50ss from GC–AG
and GT–AG introns bind to U1 snRNP during spliceosome
assembly (2). The consensus sequence for the U2-type GT–
AG 50ss motif corresponds to a perfect base pairing to the
U1 snRNA 50 end. Despite this, a high degree of variability
seems to be tolerated at most positions of the actual 50ss. In
GC–AG introns, the substitution at position +2 of the 50 ss
introduces a mismatch in the U1: 50ss helix. The PWMs
(Figure 3) show that the remainder of the 50ss sequence has
a higher degree of match to the consensus GT–AG 50ss,
apparently compensating for the mismatch at position +2
(17,23,24,50,51). Subtype switching of introns from
U2-type GT–AG to U2-type GC–AG between human, rodent
and chicken has been shown to be a common event (24).
Non-canonical U2-type introns. Non-canonical U2-type
introns with AT–AC dinucleotide intron ends have been
known to occur and are functional.
This is the first genome-wide survey for U2-dependent
AT–AC II introns (Table 1, Materials and Methods). Pre-
viously, only two human AT–AC introns in the SCN4A
and SCN5A genes were experimentally demonstrated to be
spliced by the U2- but not the U12-type splicing machinery
(5,51). The borders of these introns were conserved between
human and puffer fish. In addition, the chicken parvalbumin
gene and some xylanase genes in filamentous fungi were
hypothesized to contain AT–AC II introns. Furthermore,
a G to A transition at the first intronic nucleotide can be
rescued for splicing by a G to C transversion at the last nuc-
leotide of U2-type introns in yeast (52,53) and human
pre-mRNAs (54), although less efficiently.
We found a total of 15 AT–AC II introns in the human,
6 in the mouse and 3 in the D.melanogaster genomes. The
case for these introns is bolstered by the fact that they are pre-
served in orthologous genes, such as the AT–AC II intron in
the human and D.melanogaster TAF2 gene. In the human
dataset, 10 out of 15 of these introns are found in members
of the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel
gene family, which also have U12-type introns. Hence, the
higher number of AT–AC II introns in mammals could be
explained by the expansion of this gene family. All six mouse
AT–AC II introns are found in members of this family, and
conserved in the human genome. Interestingly, AT–AC II
introns seem to be absent in C.elegans and A.thaliana. The
very low abundance of these introns, and their presence in
vertebrates and fungi, suggest that they constitute a relic of
U2-dependent introns that have been progressively lost.
We searched for other putative non-canonical U2-type
splice sites as explained in the Materials and Methods
section. Many of the known types (55) (see http://www.tigr.
org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/Arabidopsis_nonconsensus_splice_sites.
shtml) are not in our compilation as they do not occur in the
RefSeq collection. We found 99 introns (33 in human, 46 in
mouse, 5 in fly, 11 in the worm and 4 in the plant) with an
optimal U2-type 50ss and PPT, but a non-canonical 30 intron
terminus. Out of these, the GT–AT and GT–TG introns in
the DGCR2 and ARS2 genes, respectively, are conserved
between human and mouse, suggesting that at least some of
the remaining 95 might be bonafide, functional splice sites.
U12-type splice sites
Canonical U12-type introns. We have substantially expanded
the catalogue of U12-type splice sites in four of the five
organisms we examined (Table 1). The PWMs for these
splice sites have been derived and are consistent with pre-
vious reports (6,25) (Figure 4). However, we find a more

output includes links to the GenBank accession, gene names and the intron number and length. The two highest scores for each splice-site subtype are shown. The
classification of introns is explained in the Materials and Methods section.

extended region of conservation than previously identified
(6,22,25). Specifically, the 1 position on 50ss has a strong
preference for T in U12-type GT–AG, and the three exonic
positions immediately downstream of the 30ss favor the
sequence ATA.
We have identified 671 human U12-type introns, 0.36%
of all introns, which includes 314 introns that were hitherto
unrecognized as U12-type introns. The GT–AG subtype
accounts for 469 introns while 169 introns belong to the
AT–AC subtype, and the remaining 33 lack the canonical
U12-type intron borders (Table 1). We have identified 357
of the 404 U12-type introns predicted in the most recent pre-
vious survey of U12-type introns (6) while the remainder
are from genes not present in the RefSeq collection. Mouse
frequencies for U12-type introns are very similar to those
for human, consistent with a previous study (24).

We identified 189 U12-type introns in A.thaliana (Table 1),
as compared to the 165 U12-type introns derived earlier from
a mapping of cDNA/ESTs to the genomic sequence (25).
Overall, the fraction (0.24%) of U12-type introns in
A.thaliana is smaller than the fraction in mammals.
We found 18 U12-type introns in D.melanogaster (Table 1),
of which 6 are of AT–AC subtype, 11 are of GT–AG subtype
and 1 has GC–AG terminal dinucleotide (see below). A previ-
ous study identified 19 U12-type introns in D.melanogaster
(56). We are missing one of their AT–AC introns and three
of their GT–AG introns, either due to the genes not being in
RefSeq or due to the sequences not having a good BPS.
Even though U12-type introns in D.melanogaster correspond
to a very small fraction (0.04%) of all introns, in at least
some cases they are essential for the development of this
organism (57). Strikingly, the relative abundance of each
U12 subtype in the fly is very different from that of mammals
and plants, in that D.melanogaster has a greater percentage
of AT–AC U12-type introns compared to GT–AG U12-type
introns than the other three species (33 versus 14–25%).
U12-type introns have not been found in C.elegans (8) and

failed to identify proteins unique to the U12-type spliceosome
in the C.elegans genome (1,58). Since other metazoans and
plants have U12-type introns, it has been suggested that
the C.elegans lineage lost the U12-type introns (8). Indeed,
we found some vestigial U12-type C.elegans introns whose
50ss are strongly reminiscent of U12-type GT–AG introns
in other species (Table 1).However, because the 30 end
sequences of these introns have the signature features of
C.elegans U2-type 30ss (see below), and a good candidate
sequence for a U12-type BPS is missing, they are probably
spliced by the U2-type machinery.
Non-canonical U12-type introns. A significant fraction of
U12-type introns in our dataset (5%) lack the canonical
pairs of dinucleotide (Table 2, see Materials and Methods).
These transcripts are supported by RefSeq sequences. How-
ever, a large fraction of these introns are incorrectly mapped
in other genome browsers, probably due to automated map-
ping based on canonical splice-site predictions.
Only two of these introns were found in A.thaliana, includ-
ing the previously described intron 7 of the AtG5 gene (59).
Such non-canonical introns have been experimentally shown
to be competent for splicing by the U12-type machinery (7).
The most efficient pairs were found to be GT–AG and AT–
AC, but AT–AN (where N is any nucleotide) and GT–AT
could also engage in productive splicing. Remarkably, the
splicing efficiency of these splice-site combinations corre-
lates with their frequencies in our database. Furthermore,
evidence has been found for U12-type non-canonical splicing
in samples from a Peutz–Jeghers syndrome patient that have
a A to G mutation at the +1 position of the AT–AC U12-type
50 ss in the LKB1 gene (43).
We have also identified another subtype of putative U12-
type introns with GC–AG borders, which were predicted
in an earlier survey (8). There are four candidates of these
introns in the human and mouse, and one in the fly. All
of these candidates have a perfectly conserved GCATCCT
50 ss motif, and most have an optimal U12-type BPS at an
appropriate location. Furthermore, the exonic nucleotide
upstream of the 50ss of most of these candidates do not usu-
ally conform to the U2-type consensus making them poor
substrates for U2-type splicing.
Biases in the distribution of U12-type and other rare introns.
The persistence of U12-type introns over evolutionary time is
a mystery, as they represent a very small fraction of all genes,
and some lineages and organisms, such as C.elegans, appear
to have completely lost them. We used GObar (48)
(see http://katahdin.cshl.org:9331/GO/GO.cgi), a tool that
exploits the information in Gene Ontology to unveil pathways
or functions that are enriched in a particular sample gene set,
to study the functional distribution of genes containing
U12-type introns. We find that U12-type introns are
usually found in genes involved in ion transport (25,60),
protein trafficking and cell-cycle control, among other
processes.
Genes with more than one U12-type intron are found more
often than expected from a random model for the disribution
of U12-type introns in genes, consistent with previous reports
(6,8). H.sapiens and M.musculus have 45 and 46 genes that
contain two U12-type introns, respectively, A.thaliana has
only six, and D.melanogaster has none. Furthermore,
human and mouse have two and three genes, respectively,
with three U12-type introns, all of them members of the
solute carrier family (SLC) gene family, that encode sodium
and hydrogen exchanger proteins. In mammals, considering
an average number of eight introns per gene (61) and assum-
ing an independent U12-intron distribution model, the
expected number of genes with two U12-type introns is
only six. If we include more realistic distributions of introns
amongst genes, the total expected goes up to only 16.
This physical clustering of U12-type introns could be
related to function or to the origin of U12-type introns. The
U12-type machinery is 100 times less abundant in the
nucleus than the U2-type machinery (62,63) and a possible
consequence of this is slower splicing kinetics of U12-type
introns. Indeed, there is some experimental corroboration
for this idea (64). These observations suggest that U12-type
introns persist because of their slower rates of splicing reac-
tion, which might be important for the expression of
the gene that contains them. If the U12-type intron is the
slowest step in the pre-mRNA processing, having more
than one U12-type intron in a gene might have no additional
impact on splicing dynamics.
The possibility of intron conversion from U12- to U2-type
was previously demonstrated by looking at orthologous
U12-type introns from different species (8,60), but the rate
of conversion is unknown. As pointed out in these studies,
the high conservation of U12-type splice sites and the high
degeneracy of U2-type splice sites suggests that this con-
version could be achieved by a few mutations, and that the
reciprocal conversion would be very difficult. Interestingly,
we noticed frequent subtype switching of non-canonical
U12-type introns between human and mouse. Out of 24 con-
served U12-type introns between human and mouse of which
at least one of the two is non-canonical, only 10 showed the
same intron borders (Table 3) The remaining 14 introns
underwent subtype switching. Amongst these, we found two
cases of subtype switching from a non-canonical intron pair
to another one, and ten introns that were switched from a
non-canonical intron pair to a canonical GT–AG or AT–AC
intron or vice versa. Remarkably, all these non-conserved
intron borders differ at only one position.
The AT–AG U12-type introns might represent viable inter-
mediates of subtype switching events between U12-type
AT–AC and GT–AG introns. In light of this, the >50% sub-
type switching for the non-canonical introns seem to be at
odds with the observation that no subtype switching between

Splice-site analysis by comparative genomics
We used SpliceRack to analyze the species-specific pro-
perties of splice sites from an evolutionary perspective. The
global patterns of the splice sites were compared amongst
the five species by phylogenetic approaches.
Splice-site information content across species. We measured
and plotted the information content at each position of the
50 and 30ss from the PWMs (Figures 5 and 6 see Materials
and Methods). The information content is a measure of the
degree of conservation in splice-site sequences, with lower
information content corresponding to a higher degree of
conservation, and vice versa (24,65–68).
Information content of U2-type 50ss (Figure 5): The 50ss
motifs for the two mammals are virtually identical, as
described previously (24,69). The U2-type GT–AG 50ss graph
ss graph shows that there is more conservation in the exonic
nucleotides for H.sapiens, M.musculus and A.thaliana, com-
pared to the other two simpler species, D.melanogaster and
C.elegans. This is consistent with the fact that budding and
fission yeast have poor conservation at the exonic 50ss posi-
tions, but a very strict conservation at intronic positions
(70). C.elegans and A.thaliana show weak conservation of
Ts at positions downstream of +6, which is not the case for
the other organisms (8,71). The GC–AG 50ss show higher
conservation at both intronic and exonic positions when
compared to the GT–AG 50ss (23,24,45).
Information content of U2-type 30ss (Figure 6): The U2-
type GT–AG and GC–AG 30ss show similar information con-
tent, suggesting they might be functionally very similar. All
species, except for C.elegans, show little conservation in
the exonic or intronic portions of the 30ss, probably due to
the degenerate PPT. C.elegans exhibits a shorter and more
conserved PPT in the intronic portion, with a consensus
sequence of TTTTCAGR, where AG is the terminus of the
intron (72). The existence of this conserved 30ss motif in
C.elegans is explained by a more stringent requirement for
an optimal binding site for the U2AF heterodimer that is
unique to this species (73). The conservation of G at position
+1, conserved only in H.sapiens, M.musculus and A.thaliana,
can be seen as a small decrease in information content at
that position for the three species.
Information content of U12-type 50ss (Figure 5): The
information content distribution for U12-type GT–AG and
AT–AC 50ss shows a high degree of conservation at the
intronic positions that starts decaying at position +6. The
conservation of T at position 1 of mammalian and plant,
but not fly U12-type GT–AG 50ss can be seen as a
small increase in the fly’s information content at that
position. The information content distribution for C.elegans
U12-type-like GT–AG introns is kept in the graph for
comparison.
Information content of U12-type 30ss (Figure 6): The
information content distributions for both U12-type GT–AG
and AT–AC 30ss show a very small degree of conservation
in the intronic nucleotides. This observation is consistent
with the notion that U12-type 30ss are slightly enriched
in pyrimidines but lack a PPT. The location of a BPS near
(8–14 nt) the 30 end of the U12-type intron contributes to con-
servation at these positions, as seen in the slight decrease of
information content on the left of these graphs. The small
numbers of these types of introns makes it difficult to
infer general trends for D.melanogaster and A.thaliana’s
AT–AC 30ss. The vestigial U12-type-like introns in the
nematode also contain the conserved motif of the U2-type
30ss, consistent with the view that these introns are indeed
U2-dependent.
Phylogenetic trees from PWMs
The Kullback–Leibler distance (40) (see Materials and
Methods) between PWMs for 50 and 30ss was used to calcu-
late a distance matrix between species, and phylogenetic trees
were derived from these distance matrices. It is possible to
use other methods to build trees, but this is the simplest
one (50). Trees were generated for all the splice sites together
(Figure 7), after removing the conserved dinucleotide termi-
nus of the introns from consideration, as they would hide the
signal from the other positions on the splice-sites.
From Figure 7, it is easy to see a clear separation between
U2- and U12-type 50ss motifs. The various 50 splice types
separate according to splice-site type, rather than species.
All the U2-type motifs cluster together, with a small separa-
tion between GC–AG and GT–AG types suggesting that
the GC–AG subtype is a specialized version of the U2-type

GT–AG 50ss motif. The C.elegans GC–AG motif is not
as conserved as the other GC–AG motifs, so it clusters
closer to the GT–AG motif from the same species. The
two C.elegans U2-type motifs and the A.thaliana U2-type
GT–AG motif are close to each other due to the T-rich com-
position of plant and nematode introns.
The 50ss motifs for U12-type introns are distant from the
U2-type introns, their closest relative being the GT–AG
50ss motif from A.thaliana, probably because these motifs
are rich in pyrimidines from positions +7 to +10. The C.ele-
gans U12-type-like GT–AG motif is located between the U2-
type and the bona fide U12-type GT–AG motifs, but it is clo-
ser to the U12-type motifs in the other species, consistent
with the idea that these introns could represent a small
group of vestigial U12-type introns that were converted to
the U2-type. Interestingly, in this tree the four AT–AC motifs
are located on the same branch of the tree, because these
motifs are slightly more conserved than those for U12-type
GT–AG introns.
The tree for 30ss shows that, in general, the 30ss tend to
cluster by species rather than by subtype. Most remarkably,
the three subtypes of C.elegans 30ss motifs, U2-type GT–
AG, GC–AG and U12-type-like GT–AG, occupy a distinct
branch on the tree, indicating that: (i) these motifs are
strongly related to each other, in turn suggesting that the
U12-type-like introns are indeed U2-dependent; (ii) these
motifs are separated from the rest, in agreement with the
idea of divergent evolution of C.elegans 30ss. C.elegans
exhibits two distinct features, a short and highly conserved
PPT in 30ss (72,73) and trans-splicing (36). The selection
of 30ss for efficiency in cis- as well as trans-splicing might
explain these features and the divergent evolution. Three of
the motifs in A.thaliana, U2-type GT–AG and GC–AG and
the U12-type GT–AG, also cluster together.
In summary, the phylogenetic trees for the different splice-
site motifs reflect the evolutionary relationship between the
corresponding splice sites in the five species. The clustering
of the 50ss motifs by splice-site subtype strongly suggests
that these subtypes were present in a common ancestor of
these five eukaryotes, and have evolved separately. In con-
trast, 30ss subtypes tend to cluster by species, suggesting a
more recent origin for many of the 30ss.
Since U2-type 50ss is initially recognized by its base pair-
ing to the U1 snRNA which is a more specific interaction,
while the 30ss is defined by a more non-specific binding of
the U2AF heterodimer to the PPT and AG element, which
in turn stabilizes base pairing between U2 snRNA and the
BPS. The different properties of RNA–RNA interactions at
the 50ss versus RNA–protein interactions at the 30ss imply a
greater flexibility in 30ss selection. In support of this view
we note that even within a species, there is more leeway
within the 30ss for specification of the PPT, the AG and the
upstream BPS (10,26–28).
CONCLUSIONS
We have created a reliable dataset of genomic splice sites
from five model organisms, based on RefSeq genes and their
mappings. We have classified these splice sites into various
categories, based on carefully curated PWMs for each species
and splice-site type. Non-canonical splice sites, that do not fit
into the four major categories, get a short shrift in databases
that use large-scale automated annotation, but we have con-
sidered these cases carefully. This comprehensive set of
splice sites allows robust statistical analyses, while minimiz-
ing errors. We have implemented a variety of tools, which can
be used to further analyze the splice sites in our collection.
Experiments can never reproduce the entire range of phe-
nomena that occur in nature, nor can they easily detect certain
subtle features that can only be revealed by statistical analysis
of a large dataset. For these reasons, the genomic dataset pro-
vides an ideal ‘dry-bench’ to study global patterns in splice
sites. In addition, by using the information content of the
splice-site motifs and the phylogenetic distance derived
from them, we draw inferences on the evolution of the splice
sites, which are only possible with large and reliable datasets.
We believe this dataset and its analyses will spur further
experimental work.
