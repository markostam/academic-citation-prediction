ABSTRACT
Guanine-rich DNA sequences of a particular form
have the ability to fold into four-stranded structures
called G-quadruplexes. In this paper, we present a
working rule to predict which primary sequences
can form this structure, and describe a search algo-
rithm to identify such sequences in genomic DNA. We
count thenumberofquadruplexes foundinthehuman
genome and compare that with the figure predicted by
modelling DNA as a Bernoulli stream or as a Markov
chain, using windows of various sizes. We demon-
strate that the distribution of loop lengths is signific-
antly different from what would be expected in a
random case, providing an indication of the
number of potentially relevant quadruplex-forming
sequences. In particular, we show that there is a
significant repression of quadruplexes in the cod-
ing strand of exonic regions, which suggests that
quadruplex-forming patterns are disfavoured in
sequences that will form RNA.
INTRODUCTION
Nucleic acid sequences rich in guanine are capable of forming
four-stranded structures called G-quadruplexes, stabilized by
Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between a tetrad of guanine
bases (see Figure 1) (1,2). Telomeric repeats in a variety of
organisms (3,4) have been shown to form these structures
in vitro and high-resolution structures of the human telomeric
sequence d(T2AG3)n have been solved by NMR spectroscopy
(5) and X-ray crystallography (6). Quadruplexes have also
been shown to exist in vivo in Stylonychia lemnae macronuclei
(7). The formation of these telomeric quadruplexes has been
shown to decrease the activity of the enzyme telomerase (8),
which is responsible for elongating telomeres. Since elevated
telomerase activity has been implicated in 85% of cancers
(9), this has become a significant strategy for drug deve-
lopment (10) and molecules that bind to and stabilize
G-quadruplexes have been identified (9). A number of proteins
that interact specifically with G-quadruplexes have also been
reported, including the helicases implicated in Bloom’s (11)
and Werner’s (12) syndromes the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
protein RAP1 (13,14) and the artificially selected zinc finger
protein Gq1 (15).
Recently, there has been growing interest in quadruplex-
forming sequences elsewhere in the genome. There has been
particular focus on the quadruplex formed by the nuclease-
hypersensitive element of the c-myc promoter (16–19) and
structural studies have been performed on this sequence
(20,21). Other potential quadruplex-forming sequences
include the fragile X syndrome repeat d(CGG)n (12,22,23),
and the Cystatin B promoter (24), which has a region with
sequence (CGCG4CG4)4 and is involved in epilepsy. G-rich
strands of the human insulin gene can form quadruplexes (25),
as can the mouse Ms6-hm hypervariable satellite repeat (26),
with sequence (CAGGG)n. It has recently been proposed that
the promoter regions of the RET protooncogene (27) and
Ki-ras (28) can each form a quadruplex. G-rich RNA can
also fold into quadruplex structures, e.g. the insulin-like
growth factor II mRNA (29).
To date, however, there has not been significant attention
focused on the more general question of identifying candidate
sequences throughout the genome. There has also been no
study of the general prevalence of putative quadruplex
sequences (PQS) throughout the genome and how it compares
with the chance frequency. In this paper, we outline a new
rule for the prediction of PQS based on the primary DNA
sequence and describe a program that can search DNA for
these sequences. We then investigate the frequency of
these sequences and the distribution of lengths of the loops
joining the tetrad stacks within those sequences. A paper by
Todd et al. (30) addresses the question of the loop sequences in
detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The quadruplex folding rule and the quadparser
algorithm
In order to identify and investigate novel quadruplex-forming
sequences, it is helpful to to identify PQS rapidly and simply,
based purely on their sequence. Biophysical techniques,
such as circular dichroism (14,31), NMR spectroscopy (5)

and ultraviolet melting (32), can then be used for the confirma-
tion of the structure for such candidates. No rule will be abso-
lutely accurate, but from our previous work and examining the
literature (vide infra), we have developed a simple ‘Folding
Rule’ describing sequences that may form quadruplexes. Four
aspects were considered in developing this rule: strand stoi-
chiometry; the number of stacked tetrads in the quadruplex
core; the presence of mutations or deletions; and the length and
composition of loops. This rule predicts sequences that could
form a quadruplex, but does not preclude the possibility of
some or all of the motifs forming an alternative structure.
Strand stoichiometry. Quadruplexes can be uni-, bi- or tetra-
molecular. Since under physiological conditions the strand
concentration of DNA is relatively low (in the order of
nM), except in rare exceptions such as S.lemnae macronuclei
(7), interstrand quadruplexes will be strongly disfavoured, and
we have limited our analysis to sequences that may form from
intramolecular structures.
Number of tetrads. G-quadruplex structures can, in principle,
form from any number of G-tetrad stacks. In general, the
stability increases with increasing numbers of stacks. Single
G-tetrads have only been reported in highly concentrated
guanine solutions at mM concentrations (1), and are unlikely
to be physiologically relevant. There are a few examples of
double-stack quadruplexes, such as the thrombin-binding apta-
mer (33,34) and the sequences identified as responsible for the
fragile X syndrome (22). However, because these are in gen-
eral less stable with regard either to single-stranded forms or
duplex formation (35), we have only considered sequences
capable of forming three or more G-tetrad stacks.
Discontinuities in G-tracts. Does a quadruplex have to be
made up of perfect guanine tetrads, or can it tolerate dis-
continuities in the guanine bases? A few studies have recently
been published identifying tetrads not purely comprising
guanine (36–40), but most of these are artificially designed
sequences, where a mixed tetrad is stabilized by flanking
G-tetrads. In addition, recently there have been structures
identified as having ‘slipped’ structures (41), where two quad-
ruplexes slide against each other, or intrastrand leaps (42), in
which a particular stack of guanines comes from more than
one consecutive series of bases, but these are also artificial
structures. We have performed a study (data not shown) to
explore the effects of guanine replacements and deletions on a
variant of the human telomeric sequence d(GGTTAG)n. The
variations result in sequences with significantly lower stability
and for that reason we have restricted our analysis to include
only sequences with no discontinuities in the G-tracts.
Loop length and composition. An intramolecular quadruplex
must have three loops to link the tetrads together, and they play
a large role in determining both the stability and folding pat-
tern of the quadruplex. We have investigated this effect using
biophysical techniques and molecular modelling, and this is
described in detail elsewhere (43). In summary, loops with
lengths from 1 to 7 bases were found to form quadruplexes,
with stability decreasing as length increased. In principle,
there is no reason to believe that structures cannot form
with loops of 8 or more bases, but due to the predicted decrease
in stability, we have limited the length to 7 bases.
Folding Rule. The above considerations led us to propose
the following Folding Rule:
‘A sequence of the form d(G3+N1–7G3+N1–7G3+N1–7G3+)
will fold into a quadruplex under near-physiological condi-
tions.’
In this rule, N refers to any base, including guanine, and the
near-physiological conditions are 100 mM KCl and 10 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.4).
Quadparser algorithm. We have developed a computer algo-
rithm to identify PQS from genomic data in the FASTA for-
mat, which we have termed quadparser. It can rapidly analyse
large amounts of genomic data and report on the number,
position and other parameters for identified quadruplexes. It
can process the entire human genome sequence in 20 min on
a 1.25 MHz G4 processor. It is written in C and is available as
Supplementary Material. The output formats and patterns it
searches can be customized. Throughout this work, we have
used the NCBI build 34 version of the human genome
sequence.
Explicit solution to Bernoulli model. An explicit solution for
the frequency of quadruplexes in DNA was calculated for the
case in which each DNA base is independent. By considering
the chance of obtaining four runs of at least three guanines and
the chance of obtaining each of the possible loops, a poly-
nomial expression in terms of the probability p of any base
being guanine may be derived. The full solution is shown in
the Supplementary Material, and yields the density of PQS
sequences as:
r PQSð Þ ¼ 343p12  882p13 þ 756p14  1098p15
þ 2835p16  3357p17 þ 2484p18 . . .
Markov windowed model. A more complex model of DNA
may be obtained by using a Markov model, and basing the
model on a series of individual windows to account for the
heterogeneity of DNA regions. The DNA was separated in
windows of defined size ranging from 50 to 4000 bp, begin-
ning at the 50 end of the sequence, as described in NCBI
build 34. DNA diad frequencies were then obtained for
each window by considering the first base and the next

base, and incrementing the number of observations of that
combination by one, before proceeding to the next base
until the end of the window. In this manner, a 4 · 4 matrix
was created, referring to all combinations of bases, and was
converted from number in probabilities. A simulate was then
generated, by generating the first base randomly according to
the base frequencies, and then the second and subsequent bases
based on the 4 · 4 matrix of probabilities, in each case using
the probability matrix. After this simulation was complete, the
next window was studied and the process repeated (Figure 2).
PQS density in exons. Sequences of exons identified in
ENSEMBL were downloaded using the EnsMart feature.
The focus was set to ‘Ensembl genes’ and the species to
‘Homo Sapiens’. The filter was restricted to ‘known genes’
and the output was set to give ‘exon sequences only’ with one
output per gene. The output format was FASTA, and the
sequences were analysed using quadparser.
Loop counts. Quadparser may be instructed to count the loop
lengths of each PQS it identifies, rather than outputting the full
sequence. Loops were defined as commencing from the end of
a run of three or more G’s and finishing before the next run of
three or more G’s. Runs of seven or more G’s were treated as
having as many runs of GGG as could be managed with loops
of at least 1 base, and were assumed to have equally distributed
loops. All possible quadruplexes were counted, including
overlapping sequences. For statistical analysis, the results
were output as a 7 · 7 · 7 array, corresponding to frequencies
for each possible combination of loop lengths.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Prevalence of quadruplexes in the human genome
To date, there have been no reports of the total number of
potential quadruplexes present in the human genome; rather,
individual sequences have been examined in detail. Under-
standing the prevalence is important, because it leads to the
identification of more sequences of potential biological inter-
est, and also because in order for quadruplexes to be useful as
therapeutic targets, a quadruplex ligand must ideally be spe-
cific for only one quadruplex in the genome. Furthermore, a
genome-wide analysis of quadruplex-like elements prevalence
may reveal indications of whether evolution has influenced the
occurrence of such motifs.
The quadparser algorithm, using the folding rule described
above, can identify and count all the PQS in the genome.
Where there is more than one possible quadruplex from a
given sequences of four runs of Gs, it counts only one, by
assuming that all the Gs in a run do not belong to loops. This is
done to avoid multiple-counting, and because it is hard to
unambiguously assign which G’s are in a tetrad. Indeed, it
has been shown in the literature (17,20) that in the case of
the PQS in the promoter of c-myc, d(AGGGTGGG-
GAGGGTGGGG), an ensemble of four structures is formed,
each utilizing in the tetrads either the first or fourth G of the
underlined runs. When there are more than four runs of
d(GGG), it counts the maximum number of quadruplexes
that could be formed at any given time using consecutive
guanine runs. [i.e. a sequence d(GGGTTA)8 would yield a
count of 2]. Other approaches to counting have also been
employed, such as counting the maximum number of potential
quadruplexes [5 for the example of d(GGGTTA)8]. These
give results similar to those described here (data not
shown). Because genomic data are normally supplied as a
single strand, quadparser has been used to count both G-
rich patterns (‘G-patterns’) and ‘C-patterns’, C-rich sequences
of the same form as the G-patterns. These have no direct
meaning, but do mean that a G-quadruplex could be formed
in the strand complementary to that for which the sequence
was obtained. ‘A-patterns’ and ‘T-patterns’ refer to A- and
T-rich sequences of the same form and have no known phys-
ical meaning, but are used as statistical controls. ‘GC-patterns’
refer to both G-patterns and C-patterns and likewise for
AT-patterns.
The results from counting the number of PQS in the human
genome are shown in Table 1. This shows a total of 376 000
GC-patterns and 3 260 000 AT-patterns. The excess of AT-
patterns is caused by the excess of A and T over G and C in the
human genome (29% versus 21%). Some of the GC-patterns
are located in regions with simple repeats, such as the
telomeres. However, by counting the total number of
sequences found, counting concatenated sequences as one,
it can be shown that that such repeats account for 20 000
of those found, still leaving a very considerable number else-
where. The number of GC-patterns identified accords well
with the results of an independent study by our collaborators
using a different approach (30), which found 375 000 GC-
patterns.
In the remaining sections of this paper, we describe the
outcome of studies aimed at investigating the frequency,
distribution and sequence pattern of PQS.

the complementary strand. A- and T-patterns have no known physical meaning.

Comparison of native PQS frequency with that of
shuffled DNA
Evidence of evolutionary selective pressures acting on these
sequences would provide support for the functional relevance
of these sequences. This may be examined by comparing the
number of putative GC-quadruplexes actually found to the
number predicted for randomized DNA sequences. If PQS
have a physiological consequence, then they may occur
more or less frequently than expected owing to evolutionary
pressures. To investigate the expected frequency of PQS in
DNA, we needed to develop a model for randomized DNA.
The simplest such model is to treat DNA as a sequence of
independent bases (a Bernoulli stream), each occurring with a
probability equivalent to their frequency in the human gen-
ome. There are approximate methods (44,45) for calculating
the expected number of PQS given a certain base frequency,
and we have solved this problem explicitly as well. This gives
the expected density of PQS, r(PQS), as a function of p, the
probability of any individual base being guanine:
r PQSð Þ ¼ 343p12  882p13 þ 756p14  1098p15
þ 2835p16  3357p17 þ 2484p18 . . .
However, applying this solution to the entire human genome
gives predicted frequencies for GC-patterns of 8300 and for
AT-patterns of 304 000. These results are clearly significantly
lower than those actually found, by more than an order of
magnitude. Since the discrepancy between real genomic data
and prediction arises for both ‘real’ GC-patterns and ‘control’
AT-patterns, this is suggestive of shortcomings in the model
used for DNA.
There are two reasons why this simple Bernoulli model may
be oversimplistic. First, DNA exhibits considerable structure
on the diad base level, shown in Table 2, and as described
previously by others (46,47). This means that some bases are
more likely to occur after others. As an example, there is only a
5% chance of finding a G after a C, although there is a 21%
chance in general of finding a G in any particular position. In
particular, homodiads are relatively frequent, which means
that quadruplex-forming sequences will be considerably more
frequent. Second, DNA is not homogenous with respect to
base composition, and has regions that are relatively rich in
each base. Since the number of quadruplexes found is a very
strong function of base density, this factor will have a large
impact.
In order to develop a better model of DNA, we have pro-
duced simulated chromosomes based on real chromosomes
using a windowing procedure and generating simulated DNA
while preserving the native diad frequency using a Markov
model. In summary, we take the first n bases of the chromo-
some being studied, where n is the window size, and count the
diad frequencies. These are then used to generate n bases,
which are used as the beginning of the simulated chromosome.
The next n real bases are then taken, a shuffled version
generated and added to the simulated chromosome. This is
continued until the end of the real chromosome.
Replicates of the entire human genome were generated
using this method, and the number of GC- and AT-patterns
found was calculated using quadparser. These numbers vary
considerably with the window size, and the results are shown
in Table 3 for window sizes from 50 to 4000 bases. Five
repeats of each simulation were performed, and the SD was
<1% in all cases. Large window sizes tend to produce fewer
PQS, because they average out smaller base-rich islands.
Smaller window sizes give results with more repeated units,
resulting in more PQS being identified. For extremely small
window sizes, i.e. a few bases, the Markov approach is not
satisfactory (data not shown), and for a window size of one
base, an exact replica of the initial chromosome is generated.
Comparing the results found using this Markov windowed
method with those found in the real human genome, it is
seen that for window sizes >150, there are fewer predicted
sequences than actually found for both GC- and AT-patterns.
For window sizes between 75 and 150, there are more
GC-patterns than actually found, but fewer AT-patterns. It
is interesting to note that at a window size of 75, the algorithm

correctly predicts the number of AT-patterns, i.e. 3 260 000,
but predicts 37% more GC-patterns than actually found. For
smaller windows, more of both types of patterns are predicted
than found.
The ratios of patterns for each base under different simu-
lation conditions are shown in Table 4 for each case, normal-
ized to the predicted number of T-patterns = 1. This shows
that in all cases, a ‘pseudo-Chargaff’ rule applies, with roughly
as many G-patterns as C-patterns, and similarly with A and T.
Location of putative quadruplexes
Using the ENSEMBL database, it is possible to classify
regions of the genome as related to genes. This information
was used to investigate the number of putative quadruplexes in
genes, and specifically within the exonic regions. These results
show marked differences in terms of base composition
and frequency of quadruplex-forming patterns. The exonic
regions have been determined using the annotations within
ENSEMBL. They have a base ratio that closely approximates
equality (G:C:A:T 1.05:1.04:1.07:1), and diad repeat ratios
that deviate less far from a Bernoulli model than the rest of
the genome (GG:CC:AA:TT 0.98:1.07:1.05:1 for exons,
against 0.78:0.79:1.00:1 for the whole genome) (see Table 5).
There are still some differences in these parameters between
the four bases, and as a result they give rise to different pre-
dicted X-pattern frequencies, based on a windowed Markov
model of the exons, as described previously. These ratios are
G:C:A:T 0.91:1.10:1.21:1. Examination of the actual exonic
regions reveals a very different ratio, with the observed
frequencies of X-patterns being in the ratio 0.48:0.83:0.93:1.
One feature throughout these results is that the ’pseudo-
Chargaff’ rule that applies for the whole genome need not and
does not apply to the case of exons, since the two DNA strands
are distinct in exonic regions, with only one of them being
transcribed to form RNA. However, does this show a bias with
respect to quadruplex location as well? To investigate this,
we considered the differences between the predicted ratio of
X-patterns, compared with the observed ratio. This is given in
Table 5, and gives a ratio of observed/predicted of {0.53, 0.76,
0.76, 1} for {G, C, A, T}.
The most marked effect observable from these results is
the considerable suppression of the G-patterns compared
with that predicted. This effect is greater than that observed
for C-patterns, which have a suppression of an order similar
to the effects on A-patterns. Why is this difference observed?
One discriminating factor is the fact the G-rich codons do not
code for the same amino acids as C-rich codons, but the
discrimination is not sufficient to account for our observations,
although it may form part of the explanation. An alternative
explanation is based on the observation that the G-patterns
would lead to potential quadruplexes in the mRNA strand in
addition to the DNA duplex, whereas C-patterns could only
lead to quadruplexes in the DNA. This evidence is consistent
with an evolutionary pressure reducing the number of quad-
ruplexes allowed to form in mRNA. To date, there has been
relatively little work focused on RNA quadruplexes, although
it has evoked some interest (29,48,49). These results suggest
that RNA quadruplexes could play a significant role and
should be investigated further.
Distribution of loop lengths
It has been previously shown that the length of the loops
linking the runs of oligo(G) sequences plays a significant
role in determining the stability of the resultant quadruplexes
(43,50). We, therefore, hypothesized that if there were select-
ive pressures acting on sequences with the potential to form
quadruplexes, this would be evident in the distribution of loop
lengths as well as the overall number. Any indication of devi-
ation from randomness would indicate some kind of selective
pressure, and by examining the direction of the deviation, it
might be possible to rationalize the pressures observed.
The simplest approach to this question is to consider the
distribution of loop lengths for each loop (first, second or

The actually observed data are taken from the NCBI build 34 of the human genome. The Bernoulli model and Markov models are described elsewhere in the text, and
the number below the word ‘Markov’ refers to the window size used. It can be clearly seen throughout these data that the pseudo-Chargaff rule G = C and A = T holds,
to be within 1%. This also shows that the relative depletion of GC-patterns increases with increasing window size.

frequencies of patterns of the form d(X3+N1–7X3+N1–7X3+N1–7X3+) for X=G, C,
A, T, normalized to 1 for the frequency of T-patterns, either in the actual human
genome or in a simulate using a Markov model with a window size of 75 bp. The
data show that the G-patterns are dramatically underrepresented, and there is a
weaker effect on C-patterns, and another on A-patterns.

third). This study has been performed, and the frequency res-
ults are shown in Figure 3. All possible quadruplexes were
considered. These results show that loops 1 and 3 display the
same properties as each other, but that loop 2 behaves signi-
ficantly differently. This is emphasized in the right-hand side
of Figure 3, where the excess/decrease of loop 2 frequencies
over the frequencies for loops 1 and 3 is shown for each
possible length for the real human genome. The same study
was performed on GC-patterns in simulated DNA (using the
Markov windowed model) and on AT-patterns, both simulated
and real. None of these showed any significant deviations, in
the manner observed for real GC-patterns.
This result demonstrates that there is a non-random
behaviour demonstrated by sequences capable of forming
quadruplexes. However, a more detailed analysis is required
in order to be able to make comments about the nature and
significance of the non-randomness observed. In order to do
this, the number of sequences in the genome with loop lengths
{i, j, k} was counted. The results are represented as a mosaic
plot in Figure 4. The most common set of loop lengths was
{1, 1, 1}, which accounted for 8% of all PQS. Table 6 lists the
20 most common loop length combinations, which account for
32% of all PQS. Many of these have single-base loops, a trend
also observed in an independent study by our collaborators
(30). Table 6 also lists the 20 least common loop length
combinations, which generally include longer loops. It is
also noteworthy than in none of the least common loop
length combinations is the length of loops 1 and 3 the
same. Thus, such sequences are over-represented in the cases
of the most common loop length combinations. The full data-
set of loop length combinations is given in Supplementary
Material.
We initially attempted to represent these data as three inde-
pendent distributions. However, it was immediately obvious
that there are patterns within these data that deviate from
randomness. In particular, it is clear that there is a peak in
frequency for values where the length of the first loop is equal
to that of the third loop (i = k). As a result, attempts to fit the
data to a model involving three independent distributions (one
for each loop) left as a residue a ‘spine’ of excess sequences
occurring along this diagonal. This implies that there are more
sequences than expected with two of the loops being of equal
length. In order to fit this excess into the model, an extra term
in the frequency expression is required, giving the relation-
ships shown below, where N{ik} is the predicted count with first
loop length i and third loop length k, bi and bk are the two
independent distributions, a is a constant describing the popu-
lation of the ‘spine’ and ai describes the distribution of
sequences along the spine:
Nfikg ¼ a ƒ ai þ 1  að Þbibk for i ¼ k‚
Nfikg ¼ 1  að Þbibk for i 6¼ k:
This is called diagonal quasi-independence (51), and corres-
ponds to a probability mixture model, in which with pro-
bability a, the loop lengths are constrained to be the same,
and with probability (1  a), they are independent. Fitting
the observed data to the model allows the calculation of
a value for a of 0.09, implying that 10% of the potential

quadruplex patterns show a high correlation between the
lengths of loops 1 and 3.
A correlation between loops in these GC-patterns is very
hard to explain while only considering duplex DNA. However,
it is perhaps more reasonable to expect that loop length cor-
relations could affect the properties (e.g. stability) of DNA in
the quadruplex form. This observation of strong patterns in at
least 10% of the GC-patterns is suggestive that at least this
fraction of quadruplexes may have distinct physical and/or
functional properties in vivo. Despite a few studies (43,50)
on the effect of loop length on quadruplex stability, it is not
yet clear exactly how the loops control the stability. It is
likely that the sequence of the loops must play a role, but
this is not yet understood in any detail. These statistical cor-
relations suggest further biophysical studies on quadruplex
loop lengths and loop sequences would be worthwhile in
the future. Given the frequency results shown in Table 6, a
focus on sequences with relatively short loops would be a
promising approach.
CONCLUSIONS
The human genome contains a large number of sequences that
have the potential to form quadruplexes. In principle, as many
as 376 000 quadruplexes could exist simultaneously. It is
unlikely that anything like this number would exist at the
same time, as there is likely to be a dynamic equilibrium
between quadruplex and other structural forms of DNA
(e.g. duplex), and furthermore the DNA structure will be sub-
ject to influence of chromatin structure, many classes of DNA-
binding proteins, and also the cell-type and its state. That the
number of putative genomic quadruplexes is so high does raise
an important selectivity challenge for quadruplex recognition
either by natural or unnatural molecules.
Simple modelling of DNA as a series of independent bases
is unsatisfactory for predicting the number of PQS, owing to
chromosome heterogeneity and details of the diad composition
of genomic DNA. A Markov chain approach was used to
generate DNA simulates in windows. We have demonstrated
how the predictions of PQS and AT-patterns vary as a function
of the window size. In all cases studied (window sizes from
50 to 4000 bases), the predictions of the Markov model were
closer to the actual frequencies in the human genome than
those of the Bernoulli approach.
The differentiation between G- and C-patterns in exonic
regions suggests that there is another level of selection occur-
ring, with suppression of potential quadruplexes in mRNA
sequences. Similarly, where there are potential quadruplexes
in the genome, there are strong correlations in the lengths of
the loops. This could potentially be another mechanism for
reducing their formation.
Further evidence for the in vivo significance of these
quadruplex-forming sequences comes from the observation,
both in this paper and the accompanying one (30), that the
putative loops exhibit significant non-random structure. We
show here that there are correlations between the lengths of
the loops, in a way that would be very hard to rationalize if the
sequences exist solely as duplex DNA.
Suppression of genomic G-quadruplexes could indicate that
they have been selected against in evolution. They may
broadly interfere with normal cellular activities, such as rep-
lication and transcription, by blocking access to DNA. The
existence of helicases (11,12) that are required to specifically
unwind G-quadruplex structures during transcription supports
this argument. The sequences that remain may have a role in
gene regulation or many other activities, and further detailed
studies will be required to confirm that they do indeed form
quadruplexes, and what roles they have.
Having located all of these PQS identified by the quad-
parser algorithm, they may be used for a variety of purposes
to examine particular genes or other regions of interest, and we
are actively investigating such interesting potential quad-
ruplexes. A full dataset of genomic coordinates for all poten-
tial quadruplexes are available from the authors in DAS
format, which may be uploaded to the ENSEMBL website
for visualization. We are currently investigating the biophys-
ical properties and physiological function of a number of these
sequences, and performing further bioinformatic studies
across the whole genome to investigate their correlations
with other genomic features, such as single nucleotide poly-
morphisms, nuclease hypersensitive regions, promoter regions
and regions of high cross-genome conservation.
