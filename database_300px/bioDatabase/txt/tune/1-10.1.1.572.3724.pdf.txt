Vesicular zinc (Zn21) is found in a subset of glutamater-
gic nerve terminals throughout the mammalian forebrain
and is colocalized with glutamate. Despite well-docu-
mented neuromodulatory roles, exocytosis of endoge-
nous Zn21 from presynaptic terminals has never been
directly demonstrated, because existing studies have
measured elevated Zn21 concentrations by examining
the perfusate. Thus, the speciﬁc origin of synaptic Zn21
remains a controversial subject. Here, we describe syn-
aptic Zn21 trafﬁcking between cellular compartments at
hippocampal mossy ﬁber synapses by using the ﬂuo-
rescent indicator Zinpyr-1 to label the hippocampal
mossy ﬁber boutons. We determined endogenous Zn21
exocytosis by direct observation of vesicular Zn21 as
decreasing ﬂuorescence intensity from presynaptic
axonal boutons in the stratum lucidum of CA3 during
neural activities induced by the stimulation of mem-
brane depolarization. This presynaptic ﬂuorescence
gradually returned to a level near baseline after the
withdrawal of moderate stimulation, indicating an en-
dogenous mechanism to replenish vesicular Zn21. The
exocytosis of the synaptic Zn21 was also dependent
on extracellular Ca21 and was sensitive to Zn21-spe-
ciﬁc chelators. Vesicular Zn21 loading was sensitive to
the vacuolar-type H1-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A,
and our experiments indicated that blockade of vesicular
reloading with concanamycin A led to a depletion of that
synaptic Zn21. Furthermore, synaptic Zn21 translocated
to the postsynaptic cell body upon release to produce
increases in the concentration of weakly bound Zn21
within the postsynaptic cytosol, demonstrating a feature
unique to ionic substances released during neurotrans-
mission. Our data provide important evidence for Zn21
as a substance that undergoes release in a manner simi-
lar to common neurotransmitters. VC 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The synaptic Zn21 is densely concentrated in the
presynaptic vesicles of certain glutamatergic nerve termi-
nals in areas throughout the mammalian forebrain, includ-
ing the cortex and limbic regions, with particularly high
concentrations in the hippocampal mossy ﬁber pathway
(Haug, 1967; Perez-Clausell and Danscher, 1985). This
Zn21 is stainable by a variety of histological procedures
and has been shown to be weakly bound and freely reac-
tive, thus earning it the name ‘‘chelatable’’ or ‘‘free’’ zinc.
The anatomical location of this cation and its possible
colocalization with glutamate have led to the hypothesis
that vesicular Zn21 is released from presynaptic boutons
during synaptic transmission and functions as a neuromo-
dulator. This hypothesis has been supported by evidence
from studies employing electrophysiology, ﬂuorescence
imaging, microdialysis, and radioligand binding assay
(Assaf and Chung, 1984; Howell et al., 1984; Perez-Clau-
sell and Danscher, 1986; Aniksztejn et al., 1987; Vogt
et al., 2000; Li et al., 2001b; Ueno et al., 2002; Qian and
Noebels, 2005).
An enormous body of research suggests diverse
actions of Zn21on synaptic transmission. N-methyl-D-
aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated responses are
inhibited by zinc in both a voltage-dependent and a
voltage-independent manner (Peters et al., 1987; West-
brook and Mayer, 1987). Synaptically released Zn21
may thus play an important role in shaping NMDA re-
ceptor responses at mossy ﬁber-CA3 synapses (Vogt
et al., 2000) and in proper in vivo functioning of glyci-
nergic neurotransmission (Hirzel et al., 2006). Zinc also
attenuates GABA receptor-mediated responses (West-
brook and Mayer, 1987; Smart et al., 1994; Buhl et al.,
1996; Fisher and Macdonald, 1998) and potentiates
AMPA receptor-mediated responses (Rassendren et al.,
1990). Zinc chelation has also been shown to arrest
long-term potentiation (LTP) in the mossy ﬁber?CA3
circuit of the hippocampus (Li et al., 2001a) and in cor-
ticoamygdala synapses (Kodirov et al., 2006).
Zn21 may be the ﬁrst metal ion ever suggested as a
substance that undergoes release like a neurotransmitter
during synaptic transmission (Frederickson et al., 2005).
However, there has been no direct evidence of exocytosis

or depletion of vesicular Zn21 during neurotransmission.
To establish the release of vesicular Zn21 during synaptic
transmission, it is imperative to demonstrate that the
released Zn21 originated from the presynaptic nerve ter-
minals or boutons. In previous experiments, synaptically
released Zn21 has been indirectly studied by measuring
elevated Zn21 concentrations in the perfusate (Assaf and
Chung, 1984; Howell et al., 1984). More recent ﬂuores-
cent imaging studies of Zn21 release during neural activ-
ities focused on the extracellular space or the postsynap-
tic cell body (Li et al., 2001b; Ueno et al., 2002; Qian
and Noebels, 2005). Despite current advances in Zn21
neurobiology, no model to directly study the exocytosis
of vesicular Zn21 sequestered in presynaptic terminals
has yet been described. This is due partially to the noto-
riously difﬁcult nature of presynaptic studies in situ,
where efforts are hampered by the diminutive size of the
nerve terminals compared with the conspicuous postsy-
naptic cell bodies regularly examined with electrophysi-
ology and ﬂuorescent imaging.
It is known that free zinc is essentially absent in
the intracellular and extracellular ﬂuid, the estimated
concentration (1 pM) being below the detection limits
for most analytical methods (Frederickson and Bush,
2001). To date, Zn21-containing presynaptic vesicles are
the only known source of such free or chelatable Zn21
in the brain, indicating the requirement of vesicular
Zn21 release to initiate any potential Zn21 signals during
normal neuronal function. Taking advantage of this
unique distribution of chelatable Zn21, we have visually
differentiated the mossy ﬁber boutons from their postsy-
naptic counterparts by applying the ﬂuorescent Zn21 in-
dicator Zinpyr-1 in acute hippocampal slices. Zinpyr-1
has a high afﬁnity for Zn21 (1 nM) with relative high
koff value (2.3 3 10
23 sec21), which is appreciated in
real-time imaging to study the mobilization of vesicular
Zn21; Zinpyr-1 is membrane permeable and can be pas-
sively loaded into cells, properties that allow it to stain
the synaptic Zn21 contained within synaptic vesicles
(Burdette et al., 2001; Woodroofe et al., 2004; Gold-
smith and Lippard, 2006). In our experimental model,
we have speciﬁcally labeled the Zn21-containing mossy
ﬁber boutons of the hippocampus while demonstrating a
lack of Zinpyr-1 ﬂuorescence in the CA3 pyramidal
neurons. Our comprehensive results support the role of
vesicular Zn21 as an ion that undergoes release in a
manner similar to common neurotransmitters and indi-
cate the possibility of Zn21 as an example of a new class
of neuromodulators in the form of divalent transmission
metal cations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fluorophores and Chemicals
Zinpyr-1 salts were purchased from NeuroBioTex, Inc.
(Galveston, TX). Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium-
calcium salt (CaEDTA), concanamycin A (folimycin), and
gadolinium were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals and salts
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Fluka (St. Louis, MO) or
Fisher Biotech (Pittsburgh, PA).
Hippocampal Slice Preparation
All experiments were conducted according to the prin-
ciples outlined in the Ohio University guidelines for the care
and handling of animals. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats
(200–300 g) were euthanized with CO2 and decapitated. The
brain was quickly removed and incubated for 1 min in 1–48C
artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid for extraction (sACSF) with the
following composition (in mM): NaCl 121, KCl 1.75,
NaHCO3 26, dextrose 10, KH2PO4 1.25, MgCl2 5.0. After
incubation, the brain tissue was mounted onto a stage for slic-
ing, and transverse slices of 250 lm were prepared using a
Vibratome 3000 zero-Z Plus Automated (The Vibratome
Co., St. Louis, MO). Extracted slices were transferred to an
incubation chamber containing room-temperature, standard
ACSF with the following composition (in mM): NaCl 121,
KCl 1.75, NaHCO3 26, dextrose 10, KH2PO4 1.25, MgCl2
1.3, CaCl2 2.4. All slices were incubated for 10 min prior to
beginning dye protocols and constantly perfused with 95%
O2/5% CO2 throughout all experiments. The osmolality of all
solutions measured in the range of 290–300 mOsm, and the
pH was maintained within the physiological range (7.4).
Dye Incubation and Zn21 Imaging
One millimolar stock solutions of Zinpyr-1 were pre-
pared and then diluted in ACSF to reach a ﬁnal concentration
of 20 lM. Prepared hippocampal slices were incubated in a
20 lM Zinpyr-1 ACSF solution at room temperature for
5 min. After dye loading, slices were transferred to a cham-
ber containing standard ACSF and incubated for at least
30 min prior to experimental protocols to wash out excess
dye fully and allow the Zn21 signal to reach a stable baseline.
Prepared slices were then transferred to an imaging stage and
secured in place using an inert nylon mesh stretched over a
ring of platinum wire. Solutions were continuously bubbled
with 95% O2/5% CO2 and perfused onto the imaging stage at
a rate of 2 ml/min with a peristaltic pump. Confocal images
were taken with a Zeiss inverted confocal microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and analyzed in Image Pro 5.1
(MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).
Selection of Regions of Interest and
Fluorescence Measurements
To measure mean optic density, series images were
observed at time 0. Postsynaptic cell bodies were selected
based on focal clarity and an asymmetrical, triangular shape
characteristic of a healthy pyramidal cell. Regions of interest
(ROI) were drawn as an ellipse over the interior of the post-
synaptic cell body using the analysis tools in Image Pro. This
ellipse was then copied and placed over an area of presynaptic
ﬂuorescence in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region of the
hippocampus. The area of presynaptic ﬂuorescence was chosen
based on spatial proximity (<50 lm from the original ROI)
and uniform ﬂuorescence that provided a stark contrast to the
postsynaptic cell body (see Figs. 1, 2). After selection of
Presynaptic Evidence for Zinc Release 423

ROIs, mean optic density was determined by using the Track
Objects tool in Image Pro, and optical data were copied to
Microsoft Excel 2003 for statistical analysis.
The initial ﬂuorescence F0 was determined by averaging
the baseline ﬂuorescence over 10 min before treatment. For
endogenous Zn21 experiments with line scans, F0 was deter-
mined by averaging the last 100 ﬂuorescence readings prior to
termination of high-frequency stimulation (DF in line scan
experiments was determined by averaging the 100 recordings
collected at the peak ﬂuorescence change). Data presented in
bar charts are thus unitless expressions normalized to the base-
line ﬂuorescence recorded for each experiment calculated per
the following equation: DF/F0 5 (F – F0)/F0.
Statistical Analyses
All parametric statistics were conducted in SPSS 14
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and included t-tests for paired data
and one-way ANOVA. Unplanned comparisons of signiﬁcant
differences in ANOVA were performed with Student-New-
man-Keuls post hoc tests. Tests for homogeneity of variance
were conducted using an F-max test in Microsoft Excel 2005
and Levene’s test conducted in SPSS.
RESULTS
Using the Zinpyr-1 ﬂuorophore and the unique
distribution of vesicular Zn21, we developed a presynap-
tic model to determine the exocytosis of endogenous
Zn21 at the MF-CA3 synapse in the mammalian hippo-
campus. The Zinpyr-1 signal was speciﬁc for intracellu-
lar Zn21, and there was little signal in the presence of
extracellular Zn21. Hippocampal slices dyed with Zin-
pyr-1 revealed compact Zn21 staining along the mossy
ﬁber projections (boutons) at the hilar and CA3 regions
of the hippocampus consistent with Timm’s stain, the
traditional method for detecting intracellular Zn21 (Fig.
1A,B). Zinpyr-1 ﬂuorescence was clearly localized to the
stratum lucidum of the CA3 region, where mossy ﬁber
projections from the dentate granule neurons terminate
proximal to the basal dendrites of the CA3 pyramidal
cells in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus (Fig.
1A–C). Closer examination of Zinpyr-1-stained slices
allowed us to make a clear visual distinction between
areas of bright, presynaptic ﬂuorescence in the stratum
lucidum synonymous with Zn21-containing mossy ﬁber
boutons and dark areas of postsynaptic ﬂuorescence in
the form of pyramidal cell bodies of the stratum pyrami-
dale lacking weakly bound, freely reactive Zn21 (Fig.
1D). Examination of the degree of ﬂuorescence among
these two regions showed them to be signiﬁcantly differ-
ent (Fig. 1E). The strong Zn21 ﬂuorescence from the
presynaptic stratum lucidum as well as the low back-
ground ﬂuorescence from the stratum pyramidale
remained stable for periods >50 min, providing ample
time to investigate Zn21 kinetics with pharmacological
and electrophysiological techniques. This clear visual dis-
tinction between pre- and postsynaptic areas of ﬂuores-
cence intensity in the mossy ﬁber?CA3 (MF?CA3)
circuit formed the basis of a presynaptic model for study-
ing vesicular Zn21 release and uptake at mossy ﬁber
boutons.
Presynaptic Release of Zn21 From Mossy
Fiber Boutons
Synaptic Release of Zn21 Induced by Mem-
brane Depolarization. Depolarization of the neuronal
membrane serves as the signal that triggers the release of
neurotransmitter from nerve terminals. If Zn21 is
released from the presynaptic boutons in a manner simi-
lar to common neurotransmitters, its release should be
evoked by depolarization of the mossy ﬁber axons. In

prepared using the Danscher method of Timm’s stain (Danscher,
1981), the traditional method for detecting intracellular Zn21. Note
the dark staining pattern in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus (H)
as well as the dark zinc-containing mossy ﬁbers in the stratum luci-
dum of CA3 (C3). B: Hippocampal slice loaded with the ﬂuorescent
Zn21-indicator Zinpyr-1 (20 lM). The overall staining pattern for
slices with Zinpyr-1 is very similar to that seen in Timm’s staining,
with bright green areas of ﬂuorescence in the hilar region (H) and
the stratum lucidum of CA3 (C3); CA1 (C1) shows far less staining.
C: With low-magniﬁcation (at 310) microscopy, distinct regions of
hippocampal anatomy are clearly visible in slices stained with Zinpyr-
1. The mossy ﬁbers containing histochemically active zinc ﬂuoresce
brightly in the stratum lucidum (SL) of the CA3 region. The granule
cell bodies of the dentate gyrus (DG) show only a low level of back-
ground ﬂuorescence similar to the pyramidal cells (PYR, arrows) of
the CA3 region (C3). D: With a higher magniﬁcation (at 325), py-
ramidal cell bodies (PYR, arrows) become clearly visible. Zn21-con-
taining mossy ﬁber terminals in the SL ﬂuoresce brightly, with indi-
vidual bright dots of the SL showing a diameter of 5 lm, a total
area roughly equal to the size of a single synaptic bouton. These
small areas of bright ﬂuorescence in comparison with the low level of
background ﬂuorescence observed in the stratum pyramidale form
the basis of a visual distinction between pre- and postsynaptic regions
of interest. E: Bar ﬁgure showing the degree of ﬂuorescence in the
SL (pre, pink bar) and the stratum pyramidale (post, blue bar) of
CA3 region of the hippocampus. The ﬂuorescence was normalized
to the baseline ﬂuorescence (F0) of the stratum radiatum in CA1, and
the two were signiﬁcantly different (pre mean 5 0.71 6 0.055, post
mean 5 20.35 6 0.054, n 5 14, *P < 0.001). F: Short exposure
(1 min) of slices to 60 mM exogenous K1 causes a decrease in pre-
synaptic ﬂuorescence that recovers following K1 washout. This
decrease in presynaptic ﬂuorescence is coupled with a simultaneous,
transient increase in the ﬂuorescence of the postsynaptic cell body.
G: Consecutive short exposures (3 min) of Zinpyr-1-stained slices to
60 mM exogenous K1 followed by washout (5 min) show repeating
decrease and recovery of presynaptic ﬂuorescence coupled with
steady increases in ﬂuorescence recorded at the postsynaptic cell
body. H: Quantiﬁcation of data seen in D. Fluorescence changes
seen with the second depolarization event are approximately one-half
the magnitude of the initial ﬂuorescence change (1st presynaptic

2nd presynaptic mean 5 20.025 6 0.008, second postsynaptic mean
5 0.03 6 0.013, n 5 4, *P < 0.05).

the current study, depolarization of the neuronal mem-
brane by bath application of exogenous K1 (60 mM)
caused a signiﬁcant decrease in Zinpyr-1 ﬂuorescence
recorded from the mossy ﬁber boutons. Potassium-
enriched ACSF for K1 depolarization was prepared by
substituting K1 for Na1 in standard ACSF on a 1:1 basis
maintaining the same osmolarity and pH (see Materials
and Methods). To observe the synaptic release of endog-
enous Zn21, we brieﬂy perfused the hippocampal slices
with 60 mM K1 for 1 min. This treatment induced a
decrease in presynaptic ﬂuorescence recorded from the
mossy ﬁber boutons of CA3 (Fig. 1F), indicating the
exocytosis of vesicular Zn21 in response to physiologi-
cally relevant depolarizing stimulus. After the washout
with regular ACSF, presynaptic ﬂuorescence gradually
returned to a level near baseline. Exposure to moderate,
3-min, consecutive perfusions of K1 (60 mM) caused a
similar decrease in presynaptic ﬂuorescence (Fig. 1G).
Washout of depolarizing media followed by a second
treatment with K1 demonstrated a return to baseline ﬂu-
orescence during washout, followed by a second
decrease in ﬂuorescence when slices were again depolar-
ized (Fig. 1G). Brief application of K1 thus induced
repeated episodes of Zn21 release. The magnitude of
ﬂuorescence change during this second depolarizing
event was smaller than the ﬁrst (Fig. 1H; n 5 12, P <
0.001), indicating that the vesicular pool of Zn21 is sus-
ceptible to depletion over time and offering the possibil-
ity that the characteristics of Zn21 transmission are sus-
ceptible to change due to prior neuronal activities.
To expand on our ﬁndings and to characterize
unequivocally the exocytosis of vesicular Zn21 at the
MF-CA3 synapse, we then examined Zinpyr-1 ﬂuores-
cence changes during prolonged depolarizing activity.
Untreated, the Zinpyr-1 signal remained stable over
periods >50 min (Fig. 2A), affording us ample opportu-
nity to explore our model using various pharmacological
agents. Bath application of exogenous K1 (60 mM, 10
min) caused a robust decrease in presynaptic ﬂuorescence
coupled with an immediate increase in postsynaptic ﬂuo-
rescence (Fig. 2B). To examine endogenous Zn21
kinetics further, we decreased the level of free vesicular
Zn21 by incubating slices in CaEDTA (Fig. 2C), an
extracellular chelator of Zn21 (Kd 5 4  10216 M)
known to deplete vesicular Zn21 over time (Freder-
ickson et al., 2002). By incubating slices in CaEDTA (5
mM for 10 min) prior to beginning ﬂuorescence record-
ings, we expected to decrease vesicular Zn21 and reduce
the degree of ﬂuorescence change recorded during per-
fusion of depolarizing concentrations of exogenous K1.
Preincubated slices showed an overall reduced level of
ﬂuorescence, indicating the successful reduction of intra-
cellular Zn21 by CaEDTA. The addition of K1 (60
mM) to slices preincubated with CaEDTA showed sig-
niﬁcantly less decrease in the level of Zinpyr-1 ﬂuores-
cence (or Zn21 exocytosis) recorded from the mossy
ﬁber boutons compared with the untreated group (Fig.
2D, untreated group in Fig. 2B). Together these results
further support the idea that depolarization of the neuro-
nal membrane evoked the release or exocytosis of vesic-
ular Zn21 from the mossy ﬁber boutons.
Blocking Ca21 Inﬂux Prevents Synaptic Release
of Zn21 from Mossy Fiber Boutons. The release of
neurotransmitter from nerve terminals is dependent on
the inﬂux of extracellular Ca21 through voltage-depend-
ent Ca21 channels. If Zn21 is released in a matter similar
to commonly identiﬁed neurotransmitters, we would
expect its release during neuronal depolarization events
to require the inﬂux of exogenous Ca21. In our model,
Ca21-free perfusion medium (no added Ca21) prevented
the ﬂuorescence reduction in presynaptic mossy ﬁbers in
response to K1-induced depolarization of the neuronal
membrane (Fig. 3A), indicating that the release of Zn21
from presynaptic terminals requires the presence of
extracellular Ca21. Blockade of voltage-gated Ca21
channels by gadolinium (5 lM), a voltage-dependent
Ca21 channel blocker, produced a similar result (Fig.
3B), indicating the release of vesicular Zn21 is depend-
ent on Ca21 inﬂux through voltage-dependent Ca21
channels. These ﬁndings indicate that Zn21 is stored in
presynaptic vesicles that are released by an exocytotic
process dependent on the inﬂux of Ca21 through volt-
age-gated calcium channels following depolarization of
the neuronal membrane.
Translocation of Synaptically Released Zn21
into Postsynaptic Neuron Following Membrane
Depolarization. Recorded decreases in presynaptic
ﬂuorescence were coupled with immediate increases in
postsynaptic pyramidal cell body ﬂuorescence (Figs. 1G,
2B, lower traces). The relative degree of change was
almost equal and opposite in magnitude for the two syn-
aptic regions (Figs. 1H, 2B0, bar chart; n 5 11, P <
0.01). This ﬁnding revealed a feature unique to vesicular
Zn21: upon release from the presynaptic vesicles, free
Zn21 is capable of subsequent translocation to the post-
synaptic cell body, producing increases in Zn21 levels
within the postsynaptic cytosol (Li et al., 2001b). To
examine further the translocation of synaptically released
Zn21, we closely examined the changes of ﬂuorescence
in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons. By selecting ROIs
that were proximal and distal from the presynaptic ROI,
we were able to quantify spatially dependent ﬂuctuations
in Zn21 ﬂuorescence. In areas of the postsynaptic cell
body proximal to the stratum lucidum, signiﬁcant
increases in ﬂuorescence were noted during depolarizing
events (Fig. 4A). Areas close to the center (nucleus) of
the postsynaptic cell body actually showed no change or
a small decrease in ﬂuorescence (Fig. 4A). This decrease
likely was due to reduced ﬂuorescence from Zn21-
releasing mossy ﬁbers outside of the focal plane during
confocal microscopy. Quantiﬁcation of these data
revealed that the ﬂuorescence change was comparable to
and opposite in magnitude for presynaptic and proximal
postsynaptic areas, whereas distal areas in the postsynaptic
area showed less ﬂuorescence change (Fig. 4B; n 5 4, P
< 0.005).
To determine that postsynaptic ﬂuorescence
increases were due to the translocation of synaptically

released Zn21 and not from contaminating Zn21 present
in the perfusion medium, we decided to repeat our
depolarizing experiment in the presence of a low con-
centration CaEDTA (100 lM). Although CaEDTA is a
high-afﬁnity Zn21 chelator, this compound has relatively
slow kinetics (Martell and Smith, 1974; Davis et al.,
1999; Li et al., 2001a). We reasoned that, by employing
a lower concentration of CaEDTA, we could remove
exogenous Zn21 from the perfusate without compromis-
ing the postsynaptic ﬂuorescence signal observed during
depolarization of hippocampal slices. Depolarization of
slices with 60 mM K1 in the presence of 100 lM
CaEDTA showed a result similar to the control condi-
tion, with large decreases in presynaptic ﬂuorescence
coupled with postsynaptic ﬂuorescence increases (Fig.
4C). These results support the conclusion that postsynap-
tic ﬂuorescence increases are due to the translocation of
endogenously released Zn21 rather than inﬂux of con-
taminating Zn21 from the perfusate. However, slices
treated with 5 mM CaEDTA in addition to 60 mM ex-
ogenous K1 showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the presyn-
aptic ﬂuorescent signal but no immediate increase in ﬂu-
orescence in the postsynaptic region (Fig. 4D). These
results indicated that the addition of 5 mM CaEDTA
was sufﬁcient to overcome the relatively slow kinetics of
CaEDTA chelation and bind Zn21 dynamically as it was
released during mossy ﬁber depolarization, preventing
Zn21 translocation to the postsynaptic cell body.

nous K1. D0: Pre- and postsynaptic regions of interest showed no

employed concanamycin A (folimycin), a speciﬁc inhibi-
tor of the vacuolar-type H1-ATPase (Bowman et al.,
1988; Huss et al., 2002; Mothet et al., 2005). By
destroying the electrochemical proton gradient across the
vacuolar membrane necessary for the loading of synaptic
vesicles, concanamycin A depletes glutamate by prevent-
ing the reloading of glutamate that undergoes spontane-
ous release, a process that has been shown to deplete
glutamate signiﬁcantly from the ready-releasable pool in
a matter of seconds. In this study, treatment with 1 lM
concanamycin A caused a steady decrease in presynaptic
ﬂuorescence similar to that observed with the application
of exogenous K1 (Fig. 5A), indicating a depletion of the
ready-release pool of Zn21 in a manner similar to gluta-
mate. To observe the overall effects of concanamycin A
on the activity of the CA3 synapse, we applied 60 mM
exogenous K1 after 10 min of treatment with 1 lM
concanamycin A (Fig. 5B). The lack of signiﬁcant ﬂuo-
rescence changes following K1 treatment supported the
conclusion that concanamycin A fully depleted releasable
vesicular Zn21 over time by preventing the reloading of
synaptic Zn21.
Synaptic Uptake of Zn21 at Mossy Fiber Boutons
We hypothesized that, if Zn21 undergoes release in
a way similar to a neurotransmitter, some mechanism
must exist to replenish vesicular Zn21 in the presynaptic
boutons. One likely mechanism is the uptake of Zn21
released during synaptic transmission. The actions of
such a mechanism should be observable with the appli-
cation of exogenous Zn21 to our model. We tested this
hypothesis by observing the effects of 100 lM exoge-
nous Zn21 treatment on slices stained with Zinpyr-1.
Treatment with 100 lM Zn21 induced a gradual
increase in presynaptic ﬂuorescence (Fig. 6A). To facili-
tate the uptake of exogenous Zn21 into the presynaptic
boutons of the hippocampal mossy ﬁbers, in some
experiments we ﬁrst reduced vesicular Zn21 by treating
the slices with 5 mM CaEDTA (10 min), a treatment
that might also increase the number of unbound ﬂuoro-
phores available in the presynaptic boutons and enhance
the sensitivity of the model to the uptake of exogenous
Zn21. Washout of CaEDTA and subsequent treatment
with 100 lM Zn21 caused a signiﬁcant increase in ﬂuo-
rescence (Fig. 6B) compared with ﬂuorescence induced
with exogenous Zn21 alone (Fig. 6C; n 5 7, P <
0.001). Taken together, these results support the idea
that some mechanism exists for the uptake of synaptically
released Zn21 during transmission.
We then tested the reuptake of synaptically released
endogenous Zn21. Anticipating that reuptake would be
a fast synaptic event, we employed confocal line scans of
the mossy ﬁber connections in the stratum lucidum of
the CA3 region to achieve a high degree of temporal re-
solution. Synaptic Zn21 release was achieved by depola-
rizing mossy ﬁber boutons with short, high-frequency
electrical stimulation (HFS; 100 Hz, 10 sec). Membrane
depolarization by HFS evoked a decrease in ﬂuorescence
at the mossy ﬁber boutons in a manner similar to depo-
larization by exogenous K1 (Fig. 6D). This decrease in
presynaptic ﬂuorescence intensity likely was due to the
rapid release of Zn21 from the mossy ﬁber terminals.
Fig. 3. Calcium dependence of Zn21 release. A: In Ca21-free me-
dium, treatment with 60 mM exogenous K1 caused no appreciable
chance in presynaptic or postsynaptic ﬂuorescence, indicating that the
release of Zn21 from presynaptic terminals requires exogenous Ca21.
Inset: Control experiment in which Zinpyr-1-stained slices were
exposed to 60 mM exogenous K1 in normal (calcium added) me-
dium. B: Slices treated with the voltage-dependent Ca21 channel
blocker gadolinium (5 lM) showed no appreciable change in pre- or
postsynaptic ﬂuorescence when exposed to 60 mM exogenous K1,
indicating the requirement of Ca21 inﬂux through voltage-dependent
Ca21 channels as necessary for the release of vesicular Zn21. Inset:

nous K1 in the absence of gadolinium. C: Bar graph comparing pre-
synaptic ﬂuorescence changes resulting from depolarizing K1 stimulus

in which normal Zn21 release was permitted to occur [control mean

Immediately after withdrawal of the test stimulus, a sig-
niﬁcant increase or a ‘‘hump’’ in ﬂuorescence was noted
in the presynaptic area of the MF?CA3 circuit (Fig.
6D), a phenomenon we attributed to the reuptake of
endogenous, synaptically released Zn21. The increase in
ﬂuorescence lasted for several seconds before ﬂuores-
cence regression, which likely was due to diffusion of
the [Zn21]i transient. If this ﬂuorescence increase was
caused by the reuptake of endogenous Zn21, we would
expect the cell-impermeable, extracellular Zn21-speciﬁc
chelator CaEDTA to block reuptake by dynamically
chelating Zn21 as it is released into the synaptic cleft.
To test this hypothesis, we repeated HFS in the presence
of 5 mM exogenous CaEDTA. In the CaEDTA-treated
group, the ﬂuorescence transient (hump) was not
observed (Fig. 6E). Comparing the mean ﬂuorescence
change after electrical stimulation over seven trials, we
found that the ﬂuorescence change or the hump in
untreated slices was signiﬁcantly greater than that
observed in the presence of CaEDTA (Fig. 6F; n 5 7, P
< 0.001). Taken together, these data suggest the exis-
tence of an active mechanism of reuptake to replenish
synaptically released Zn21 into the vesicles of the mossy
ﬁber boutons and possibly arrest potential Zn21 signals
because of the release of free Zn21 during synaptic
transmission.
Fig. 4. Zn21 translocation. A: The degree of postsynaptic ﬂuores-
cence observed was dependent on the spatial location of the region
of interest. Fluorescence decreased in the presynaptic ROI with
treatment by 60 mM exogenous K1 (pink line). In ROIs selected
from within the postsynaptic ROI very close to the pyramidal cell
membrane next to the stratum lucidum, ﬂuorescence increases were
at their highest (blue line). ROIs selected from deep within the py-
ramidal cell body showed a slight decrease in ﬂuorescence (orange
line) likely resulting from decreasing background noise from loss of
ﬂuorescence from mossy ﬁbers outside of the focal plane. B: Left

ROIs. Bar graph at rught compares ﬂuorescence changes in different
spatial locations within the postsynaptic body. A one-way analysis of
variance revealed these means to be signiﬁcantly different [presynaptic
mean 5 20.25 6 0.043 (blue bar), proximal mean 5 0.22 6 0.10
(pink bar), distal mean 5 20.11 6 0.046 (orange bar), n 5 4, *P <

were still visible in the postsynaptic regions presence of 100 lM

opposed to inﬂux of contaminating Zn21 from the perfusate. D:
Treatment with 60 mM exogenous K1 in the presence of 5 mM

cally released Zn21 to CaEDTA as effective in blocking Zn21 trans-
location [presynaptic mean 5 20.303 6 0.02 (hatched bar), postsy-

Presynaptic Evidence for Zinc Release 429
Journal of Neuroscience Research DOI 10.1002/jnr
DISCUSSION
This study provides evidence for the release of ve-
sicular Zn21 by showing Zn21 exocytosis directly from
presynaptic mossy ﬁber boutons. Membrane depolariza-
tion by high-concentration extracellular potassium and
electrical stimulation induces signiﬁcant Zn21 depletion
in the mossy ﬁber boutons, indicating the release of ve-
sicular Zn21 at the MF?CA3 circuit. This release of
vesicular Zn21 is sensitive to Zn21-speciﬁc chelators and
is dependent on the inﬂux of extracellular Ca21 in a
manner similar to commonly described neurotrans-
mitters. Blocking vesicular reloading of spontaneously
released Zn21 by speciﬁcally inhibiting the vacuolar-type
H1-ATPase depletes (reduces) vesicular Zn21 in the
mossy ﬁber boutons. Our data demonstrate that some
mechanism exists for the uptake of synaptically released
Zn21 during transmission. Finally, the present study
directly demonstrates the translocation of synaptically
released Zn21 into postsynaptic neurons, a feature
unique to this divalent metal ion, suggesting that Zn21
may function as a transsynaptic anterograde messenger in
the hippocampus.
Overwhelming data suggest that histochemically
active Zn21 is compartmentalized and concentrated
within the synaptic vesicles of the presynaptic boutons of
the MF?CA3 circuit (for review see Frederickson
et al., 2000). In agreement with these ﬁndings, our data
support the viewpoint that histochemically active Zn21
is concentrated within the synaptic vesicles of the mossy
ﬁber boutons with images that clearly show bright intra-
cellular Zn21 ﬂuorescence in the presynaptic stratum
lucidum (not the stratum pyramidale) of the CA3 hippo-
campal region (Fig. 1B–D) matching Timm’s stain (Fig.
1A). The sensitivity of our recorded signals to Zn21-spe-
ciﬁc chelators further supports the conclusion that we
are observing changes resulting from the binding of his-
tochemically active, labile Zn21. Essentially, our experi-
mental model allows distinct and simultaneous examina-
tion of both pre- and postsynaptic events of Zn21 ﬂuc-
tuation during neural activity, representing the ﬁrst time
such a technique has been described. Many models of
synaptic transmission have been developed at the postsy-
naptic level, but few techniques exploring presynaptic
events have been demonstrated. This likely is due to the
diminutive size of the nerve terminals in the brain as
well as the nature of electrophysiological and imaging
techniques, many of which involve manipulations of
postsynaptic membrane currents, membrane potentials,
or cellular signaling pathways to create some observable
effect. In our experiments, there was a clear distinction
between morphological layers of the hippocampus
loaded with Zinpyr-1 (Fig. 1A–E), allowing comparisons
between presynaptic and postsynaptic ﬂuctuations in
Zn21 concentrations, which should be useful to
researchers employing slices from whole brains rather
than cultured neurons. We believe that the dynamic vis-
ualization of intracellular Zn21 described in this study
combined with other ﬂuorescent probes and tracers will
be an asset to future investigations of the complex proc-
esses of cellular trafﬁcking and signaling involved in
Zn21 homeostasis.
By measuring the Zn21 concentrations in the
extracellular space or perfusate, previous research has
suggested that vesicular Zn21 in the mossy ﬁber boutons
undergoes release in a manner similar to commonly
Fig. 5. Zn21 activity depends on the vacuolar-type H1-ATPase. A:
Treatment with 1 lM concanamycin A causes a decrease in ﬂuores-
cence, because spontaneously released Zn21 can no longer be
reloaded into the synaptic vesicles (mean change 5 20.37 6 0.03, n
5 12). Note that this change is due to the spontaneous release of
Zn21 as opposed to release induced by depolarization. B: Application
of 60 mM exogenous K1 following treatment with 1 lM concana-
mycin A caused no signiﬁcant change in ﬂuorescence, indicating that
concanamycin A treatment was sufﬁcient to reduce Zn21 activity in
the MF-CA3 synapse in a manner similar to glutamate.

described neurotransmitters, being both Ca21 dependent
and tetrodotoxin sensitive (Li et al., 2001b; Ueno et al.,
2002; Qian and Noebels, 2005). In these reports,
increases in [Zn21]o have been shown to be achievable
via the application of physiologically relevant stimuli,
being induced by both electrical stimulation and depola-
rization of the neuronal membrane by increasing con-
centrations of extracellular K1. However, in part
because of the method of measuring elevated Zn21 lev-
els indirectly in the extracellular space, the source of
Zn21 accumulation in these studies has been a matter of
debate (Bastian and Li, 2007). Results in the present
study support the release of Zn21 by directly de-
monstrating vesicular Zn21 exocytosis from mossy ﬁber
boutons (Figs. 2, 4). Zn21 exocytosis is further shown
to be calcium dependent, being arrested by calcium
channel blockade and by perfusion of Ca21-free media
(Fig. 3).
Our experiments with concanamycin A (Fig. 5)
provide evidence for a mechanism of Zn21 loading into
synaptic vesicles that is dependent on the proton electro-
chemical gradient generated by the vacuolar H1-ATPase
Fig. 6. Properties of presynaptic Zn21 uptake. A: Treatment with
100 lMZn21 yielded a ﬂuorescent increase recorded from the presynaptic
region of the MF?CA3 synapse. B: Treatment with 5 mM exogenous
CaEDTA caused a reduction in presynaptic ﬂuorescence, indicating the
deduction of vesicular Zn21 from the presynaptic mossy ﬁber terminals
by the chelator. Subsequent treatment with 100 lM exogenous Zn21
showed ﬂuorescence increases in the presynaptic mossy ﬁber area, indi-
cating that prechelation of vesicular Zn21 reduces necessary Zn21 sto-
rages (in vesicles) and enhances exogenous Zn21 uptake. C: Bar graph
summarizing the data of ﬂuorescence change data. Fluorescence for the
5-mM-CaEDTA group showed a signiﬁcantly greater increase than the
Zn21-only group (Zn21-only group mean 5 0.0579 6 0.01, 5-mM-
CaEDTA group mean 5 0.19 6 0.02, n 5 7, *P < 0.001). D: By
using confocal line scans in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region of
the hippocampus, a high temporal resolution could be obtained. Treat-
ment of Zinpyr-1-loaded slices with high-frequency electrical stimula-
tion (100 Hz, 0.3 mA, 10 sec) resulted in a decrease in ﬂuorescence
from line scans in the stratum lucidum of CA3, indicating the release of
vesicular Zn21 from the mossy ﬁber terminals in response to depolariz-
ing stimulus. Immediately following the stimulus, a resurging ﬂuorescent
transient (arrows) was observed, indicating the reuptake of synaptically
released Zn21. E: By applying high-frequency electrical stimulation in
the presence of 5 mM CaEDTA, the ﬂuorescence hump was eliminated,
indicating that the chelator dynamically bound Zn21 released from the
mossy ﬁber terminals and prevented Zn21 reuptake to presynaptic bou-
tons. F: Bar ﬁgure of DF/F0 values for the above-described experiments.
(F0 was determined by averaging the last 100 ﬂuorescence readings prior
to termination of high-frequency stimulation.) The resurging ﬂuores-
cence transient (hump) in untreated slices was signiﬁcantly greater than
that observed in slices treated with HFS in the presence of CaEDTA
[untreated mean 5 0.066 6 0.013 (green bar), CaEDTA-treated mean
5 20.0032 6 0.0019 (red bar), n 5 7, *P < 0.001].

in a manner similar to glutamate (see also Cavelier and
Attwell, 2007). It is likely that glutamate and Zn21 are
actively sequestered and stored within the same vesicles
(Perez-Clausell and Danscher, 1985; Beaulieu et al.,
1992; Wenzel et al., 1997), but it may be that they are
stored in wholly separate vesicles and merely undergo si-
multaneous release. Future studies are needed to clarify
this issue. Furthermore, the data also indicate that block-
ing vesicular loading by inhibition of the vacuolar-type
H1-ATPase is sufﬁcient to deplete readily releasable
Zn21 over time. Taken together, these data indicate that
Zn21 undergoes vesicular loading that is dependent on
the proton electrochemical gradient in a manner similar
to other neurotransmitters. The implications of the
kinetics of Zn21 release with respect to neuronal activa-
tion and the physiological function of Zn21 will have to
be clariﬁed in future studies.
Despite ample evidence to support the release of
Zn21 in a manner similar to common neurotransmitters,
scarcely any progress has been made since the original
description of the reuptake of synaptically released Zn21
by Frederickson and his colleagues more than 20 years
ago (Howell et al., 1984). It now appears that Zn21 is
sequestered into synaptic vesicles by the speciﬁc Zn21
transporter ZnT3 (Palmiter et al., 1996; Wenzel et al.,
1997; Cole et al., 1999). However, the mechanisms
involved in the cellular trafﬁcking of Zn21 to boutons
are still enigmatic. If Zn21 has a neurotransmitter-like
function, then some mechanism must exist to maintain
transient Zn21 stores and replenish vesicular contents
following neuronal activities. Speculative models of
transport include conceptual processes by which Zn21
traverses the distance between the cell body and nerve
terminals (Colvin et al., 2003). Here we show that the
decrease of vesicular Zn21 by chelation is reversible by
subsequently exposing the cells to exogenous Zn21(Fig.
6), suggesting a mechanism of uptake within the presyn-
aptic terminals. Our data also suggest that synaptically
released Zn21 may undergo reuptake to mossy ﬁber
boutons. This reuptake of synaptically released (endoge-
nous) Zn21 is abolished by a Zn21-speciﬁc chelator that
dynamically binds and removes Zn21 in the synaptic
cleft upon release.
The cytoplasmic levels of Zn21 are probably regu-
lated by zinc inﬂux and efﬂux transporters. The presence
of the high-afﬁnity Zn21-speciﬁc transporter ZnT3 may
also help maintain a low concentration of cytoplasmic
Zn21 in the mossy ﬁber boutons by loading free Zn21
into synaptic vesicles. Active sequestration and vesicula-
rization of Zn21 consequently create a concentration
gradient across the membrane, with cytosolic concentra-
tions of free Zn21 in the picomolar range (Krezel and
Maret, 2006). Previous research has estimated the con-
centration of synaptically released Zn21 at the cleft to
reach as high as 10 lM (Vogt et al., 2000; Li et al.,
2001b), implying that the concentration difference
between the cytosol of the presynaptic boutons and the
extracellular space could be as high as 1,000-fold (pM to
lM). Zn21 uptake following neurotransmission could
therefore be like that described for other ions: a passive
process in which Zn21 moves from an area of high con-
centration in the synaptic cleft to an area of low concen-
tration within the presynaptic cytosol, a process we
would expect to be mediated by as yet unidentiﬁed ion
pores or channels.
Our data indicate that Zn21 release, unlike release
of conventional neurotransmitters, is coupled with a rise
in the cytosolic Zn21 in postsynaptic neurons. The abil-
ity of Zn21 to enter postsynaptic cells and directly affect
intracellular signaling pathways truly demands a reconsid-
eration of the conventional concept of synaptically
released substances as molecules that bind surface recep-
tor proteins and exert their inﬂuences by changing the
permeability of membrane channels or the activation
states of second messengers. It is reasonable to expect
the translocation of synaptically released Zn21 under
physiological conditions to be through divalent metal
cation-permeable, glutamate-activated postsynaptic chan-
nels. Coreleased glutamate can promote Zn21 entry into
the neuron by opening Zn21-permeable AMPA/kainate
channels directly (e.g., Ca21-A/K; Yin and Weiss, 1995)
or indirectly through depolarization of the membrane
(e.g., voltage-dependent calcium channels; Li et al.,
2002). Zn21 translocation into postsynaptic neurons
would thus not take place unless both presynaptic release
and postsynaptic channel opening occurred simultane-
ously. Previously, we reported translocation by electrical
stimulation (at mossy ﬁbers), a method that results in the
synaptic release of both Zn21 and glutamate (Li et al.,
2001b). The translocation of synaptically released Zn21
raises the intriguing possibility that Zn21 may interact
with many cytosolic macromolecules in the postsynaptic
cell (Vallee and Falchuk, 1993; Hubbard et al., 1991;
Park and Koh, 1999; Lengyel et al., 2000).
What remains largely unclear is the function of the
vesicular Zn21. Recent studies on the physiological
actions of synaptically released Zn21 indicate that synap-
tic Zn21 modulates the functions of NMDA receptors
(Vogt et al., 2000) and glycine receptors (Hirzel et al.,
2006) and plays a role in synaptic plasticity (Li et al.,
2001a; Kodirov et al., 2006). While the search for the
function of synaptic Zn21 continues, once a deﬁnitive
role for this metal transmission ion in neurotransmission
has been identiﬁed, a reconsideration of the classic deﬁ-
nition of neurotransmitters will be unavoidable. Zinc
may very well be an example of a new class of neuro-
transmitter in the form of divalent metal cations. If the
ions involved in synaptic transmission can themselves
function as neurotransmitters, clearly the classic picture
of transmission must be expanded to include explana-
tions for the events that we and others have now docu-
mented.
