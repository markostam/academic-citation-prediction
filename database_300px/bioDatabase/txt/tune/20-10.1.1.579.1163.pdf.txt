ABSTRACT
WormBase (http://wormbase.org), a model organism
database for Caenorhabditis elegans and other re-
lated nematodes, continues to evolve and expand.
Over the past year WormBase has added new data
on C.elegans, including data on classical genetics,
cell biology and functional genomics; expanded the
annotation of closely related nematodes with a new
genome browser for Caenorhabditis remanei; and
deployed new hardware for stronger performance.
Several existing datasets including phenotype des-
criptions and RNAi experiments have seen a large
increase in new content. New datasets such as the
C.remanei draft assembly and annotations, the
Vancouver Fosmid library and TEC-RED 50 end sites
are now available as well. Access to and searching
WormBase has become more dependable and flexi-
ble via multiple mirror sites and indexing through
Google.
DESCRIPTION
Much of our understanding of biological processes and
human biology comes from a vast amount of data generated
in the study of a few model organisms. The National Human
Genome Research Institute (NHGRI; http://www.genome.
gov/) in the United States and the British Medical Research
Council have funded model organism databases (MODs) to
store and integrate information for individual model organ-
isms. WormBase is one of these MODs for the small, soil
nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. WormBase originated in
2001 and initially was simply a web-based interface for its
predecessor, ACeDB (1,2) (http://www.acedb.org/), which
contained primarily the genetic and physical maps, and the
genome sequence of C.elegans. Over the years, WormBase
has evolved and expanded through developing and utilizing
better software, and providing richer content (3) by bringing
in data from classical genetics, cell biology and functional
genomics (4,5), and the genomic sequences of other closely
related nematodes (6,7).
WormBase is maintained by the International WormBase
Consortium, a group of 30 scientists located at four
sites (http://www.wormbase.org/wiki/index.php/WormBase_
Consortium). The data are organized into a single database
that is available for downloading (http://www.wormbase.
org/wiki/index.php/Downloads) and web browsing. Access
to, and use of, the database and resources are freely available,
subject to an Acceptable Use Policy (http://www.wormbase.
org/wiki/index.php/Acceptable_use_policy) and copyrights
(http://www.wormbase.org/wiki/index.php/WormBaseWiki:
Copyrights). There is also a User’s Guide (http://www.its.
caltech.edu/~wormbase/userguide/), an evolving Wiki site
(http://www.wormbase.org/wiki) and an email-based Help
Desk (wormbase-help@wormbase.org)
WormBase is not a static database. It is constantly growing
with new data continually being added and made available to
users through new builds and releases of the database every
three weeks. Every 10th release is maintained as a perma-
nently available, stable data source for reference. This review
is an overview of major new content, software and perfor-
mance improvements, and how the user community helps
to focus efforts of WormBase.

NEW CONTENT
WormBase’s content has doubled in the last three years as
measured by the size of its underlying database (Figure 1).
This growth is expected to increase as research using C.ele-
gans expands and more nematode genome sequencing pro-
jects are completed.
Additions to existing data types
Phenotypes. Over the past year one of the largest percent-
age increases in an existing data type has been for pheno-
type objects. There have been major changes in phenotype
curation, including a new and expanded Phenotype Ontol-
ogy, the evaluation and consolidation of preexisting pheno-
type classes, and improvements in phenotype curation
methods. All of these allow more accurate and detailed
phenotype information to be stored in WormBase, and
make querying for phenotype-related information more effi-
cient. Consequently, the number of phenotype objects in
WormBase has increased dramatically over the past year
from 119 to 1282.
Gene Ontology. Gene products annotated with Gene Ontol-
ogy (GO) terms are another existing data type to see a
large percentage increase. WormBase is a member of the
Gene Ontology Consortium (8), and is developing GO con-
tent and annotating C.elegans’ genes in GO terms. Currently
there are over 50 000 GO annotations for over 10 000 genes
in WormBase. Most of these are automated mappings,
although there are curator-performed, manual annotations
for 700 genes with over 800 unique papers cited as refer-
ences. The automatic GO annotations are of two types. The
first is the automated assignment of GO terms to genes based
on the RNAi-knockdown phenotype. For example, an RNAi
phenotype of Egl (egg-laying defective) is automatically
assigned the GO biological process term ‘oviposition’. These
are based on manual mapping of phenotypes to GO terms
from large-scale RNAi screens. The second type of automated
GO annotation uses the InterPro2GO mappings (http://www.
geneontology.org/external2go/interpro2go) provided by the
European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/).
WormBase has recently begun determining InterPro domains
with each build to ensure that they are completely up to date.
These are GO term assignments based on protein family,
domain, repeat, etc. In WormBase the GO annotations can
now be found in a Gene Ontology section on the Gene page,
which is the most common entry point for users (Supplemen-
tary Figure 1a). A summary of all the GO annotations (Supple-
mentary Figure 1b) is reached through the GO summary link in
the ‘Gene Ontology’ section. Details for individual annotations
(Supplementary Figure 1c) can also be obtained through links
in the section.
RNAi. RNAi data have also increased significantly over the
past year, specifically from papers that describe individual
RNAi experiments. Curation of these experiments is slow
and labor intensive compared with papers containing large-
scale datasets. Nonetheless, there has been a 150% increase
in the individual RNAi experiments in WormBase. There
are currently 2754 such experiments. Including curation of
large-scale datasets, there are 63 740 total, curated RNAi
experiments in WormBase, compared with 59 882 a year
ago. There is still more to do, however. Approximately
45% of 871 C.elegans papers that contain RNAi data have
been curated, compared with just over 20% a year ago.
RNAi results are summarized in the Function section of the
Gene page (Supplementary Figure 2a). A link to view all
RNAi experiments that target the gene takes the user to a
table (Supplementary Figure 2b) containing the details and
results of each RNAi experiment.
Microarray data. The June 2006 database release (WS160)
has microarray data from 33 papers describing 417 experi-
ments, which represents almost a doubling in the number of
curated, microarray papers and a 78% increase in the number
of curated experiments in WormBase over the past year.
To support microarray research in the worm community,
the probe sets for two new microarray platforms available
from Agilent (http://www.chem.agilent.com/scripts/pds.
asp?lPage¼29452) and Washington University’s Genome

Sequencing Center (http://www.genome.wustl.edu/genome/
celegans/microarray/ma_gen_info.cgi) are now in WormBase.
These are in addition to the Affymetrix chip data previously
available in WormBase. All of these data can be downloaded
using the WormBase data-mining tool, WormMart (http://
www.wormbase.org/biomart/martview). The probes are
mapped to the genome sequence and displayed as a track on
the Genome Browser (9) (Supplementary Figure 3a). They
are also mapped to corresponding gene models (Supplemen-
tary Figure 3b) with detailed reports (Supplementary Figure
3c) linked to the Gene page.
Intellectual lineage. The Intellectual Lineage was conceived
as a way to indicate the heritage of the C.elegans research
community. The types of connections a person can have are
as follows: Supervised, Supervised by and Collaborated with.
There are 1461 people that have connections to other people
with 3729 person-to-person connections. This is up from
1030 people and 2626 person-to-person connections from a
year ago. The lineage for an individual can be found on
their Person page (Supplementary Figure 4), while the global
view of the entire worm community lineage is available at
WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org/presentations/2005/
2005-intellectual_lineage.html).
New datasets
Caenorhabditis remanei annotations. A preliminary, draft
assembly and automated annotations of the C.remanei gen-
ome are now available on a Genome Browser (http://
wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse/remanei/) and can be down-
load from the WormBase ftp site (ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/
pub/wormbase). Annotations include gene predictions from
several ab initio and alignment-based algorithms. Sequence
improvement is ongoing at the Washington University Gen-
ome Sequencing Center with a final draft assembly and
new annotations anticipated early in 2007. A summary of
the best BLASTP match to C.remanei is now displayed on
C.elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae Gene pages (Supple-
mentary Figure 5).
Vancouver fosmids. The fosmid library constructed and
mapped to the genome by Don Moerman and colleagues at
the C.elegans Reverse Genetics Core Facility located at the
University of British Columbia is now available on the Gen-
ome Browser in the YAC, Fosmids and Cosmids track (Sup-
plementary Figure 6) and searchable in WormBase. This
library was made to supplement the aging cosmid and YAC
libraries used in the original mapping and sequencing of the
genome, some of which are now over 20 years old, and are
more difficult to work with than fosmids.
TEC-RED. This relatively new technique involves trans-
spliced exon coupled 50 RNA end determination, which iden-
tifies 50 ends of expressed genes in nematodes [details of the
procedure can be found in reference (10)]. The TEC-RED
data of Hwang et al. (10) is now in WormBase and can be
viewed in the Genome Browser (Supplementary Figure 7).
These data have been used extensively to update numerous
gene structures.
IMPROVED ACCESS AND USABILITY
Fast and robust access
Community use of WormBase continues to grow. There are
now over 2 million page hits per month, a 40% increase
over the past year, with the Gene page being the most
frequently accessed page. This increase prompted the deploy-
ment of a multiply-redundant, load-balancing server system,
which now distributes requests across three back-end servers,
each capable of serving the complete WormBase site. Two
additional servers handle specialized tasks such as BLAST
requests and query pages. There is also robust caching that
delivers the most frequently requested pages from a high-
speed, in-memory and on-disk cache. These improvements
have resulted in dramatic increases in reliability and perfor-
mance. Inserting low-cost machines into the existing infras-
tructure can easily accommodate increased demand in the
future.
Access to the data at WormBase is becoming more diverse
and flexible. In addition to the main WormBase site located
at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (http://www.
wormbase.org/), there are now two new mirror sites: one at
the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute in England (http://
wormbase.sanger.ac.uk/) and one at the University of Mar-
seille in France (http://crfb-3.univ-mrs.fr/) that provide flexi-
bility and backup if the main server experiences problems.
This increases the total number of mirror sites to four with
the existing sites at the California Institute of Technology
(http://caltech.wormbase.org/) and the Institute of Molecular
Biology and Biochemistry in Greece (http://imbb.wormbase.
org/). There are links to all the mirror sites and the main
and development site on the WormBase homepage (Supple-
mentary Figure 8).
Another portal to WormBase is through WormBook (http://
www.wormbook.org/). WormBook content is extensively
linked to WormBase with Genes, Proteins and Cells linked
to the relevant pages in WormBase. Links from WormBase
back to WormBook have recently been implemented to
provide users easy access to background and in-depth
information.
Improved searching
More recently, access to WormBase can be gained through
search engines such as Google, which are now able to
index the site. Previously their access had been restricted
due to load issues on the old, single server infrastructure.
Researchers worldwide can now search the vast content of
highly curated data without having to actually visit the
WormBase site. Google searches can be limited to Worm-
Base results by using the format ‘site: www.wormbase.org
[search terms]’. Google’s page caching also provides an addi-
tional layer of redundancy during unexpected server interrup-
tions at the WormBase site.
Searching for strains at the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center
(CGC) has been improved and is now hosted at WormBase.
In addition to searching by strain name, users may now
search for strains carrying a specific gene or allele, or other
information found in the strain class (i.e. species, mutagen,
data received and remarks).

Improved data presentation
Data layout and access has become more intuitive with new
or updated web pages. Information from the Protein Data
Bank’s TargetDB (11) (http://targetdb.pdb.org/), which pro-
vides status and tracking information on the production and
solution of structures, is now displayed on Gene pages.
Also on the Gene page, a GO summary (Supplementary
Figure 1) has been added as well as three types of evolution-
ary data: InParanoid clusters of orthologous genes (12)
(http://inparanoid.cgb.ki.se/), Treefam’s (13) (http://www.
treefam.org/) curated ortholog and paralog assignments
(Figure 2), and C.elegans/C.briggsae mutual best BLASTP
matches (Supplementary Figure 5). The Gene pages also
include the phenotype of RNAi experiments, and physical
and genetic interactions, which are now displayed in a conve-
nient table (Supplementary Figure 2a).
WORMBASE IS COMMUNITY DRIVEN
The focus and direction of WormBase is driven by the user
community. Two ways this occurs is through user surveys
and the WormBase advisory board. User surveys are commis-
sioned periodically to gauge user concerns and direct future
efforts for data curation. The most recent survey was con-
ducted in the fall of 2005 (http://www.wormbase.org/db/
misc/2005_survey). The results were discussed at the Worm-
Base advisory board in November 2005 and summarized
in the January 2006 WormBase Newsletter (http://www.
wormbase.org/announcements/newsletters/pdf/2006-01.pdf).
One of the concerns of many of the respondents was the
speed of WormBase. The Advisory Board felt improving
response time should be a major priority, and WormBase
responded with the new hardware structure, additional servers
and page caching described above.
The WormBase Advisory board meets once a year with the
entire WormBase staff to review progress and prioritize pro-
jects for the upcoming year. The board consists of several
members of the C.elegans research community, as well as
people with expertise in bioinformatics and databases.
WormBase also reaches out to the user community by
having staff members at all the international, regional and
topical C.elegans meetings, as well as other meetings, often
presenting talks and posters, but mainly to receive input from
users regarding problems as well as new features or datasets
they would like to see WormBase host. Some requests are
for information for which WormBase simply does not
have access, such as large-scale studies before publication.

WormBase strives to have data available at the time of pub-
lication and encourages authors to contact WormBase about
upcoming publications.
The WormBase Wiki site (http://www.wormbase.org/wiki)
provides a mechanism for users to easily add content to
WormBase. Individuals can post experimental protocols,
make posting about meetings and job openings, or add useful
information about their favorite gene(s). A long-term goal is
for the Wiki site to assume the role of the print version of the
Worm Breeder’s Gazette.
