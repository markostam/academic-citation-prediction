Numerous investigations applying the cloning and sequencing of rRNA genes (rDNAs) to the study of marine
bacterioplankton diversity have shown that the sequences of genes cloned directly from environmental DNA do
not correspond to the genes of cultured marine taxa. These results have been interpreted as support for the
hypothesis that the most abundant heterotrophic marine bacterioplankton species are not readily culturable
by commonly used methods. However, an alternative explanation is that marine bacterioplankton can be easily
cultured but are not well represented in sequence databases. To further examine this question, we compared
the small-subunit (SSU) rDNAs of 127 cellular clones isolated from a water sample collected off the Oregon
coast to 58 bacterial SSU rDNAs cloned from environmental DNAs from the same water sample. The results
revealed little overlap between partial SSU rDNA sequences from the cellular clones and the environmental
clone library. An exception was the SSU rDNA sequence recovered from a cellular clone belonging to the
Pseudomonas subgroup of the g subclass of the class Proteobacteria, which was related to a single gene cloned
directly from the same water sample (OCS181) (similarity, 94.6%). In addition, partial SSU rDNA sequences
from three of the cultured strains matched a novel rDNA clone related to the g subclass of the Proteobacteria
found previously in an environmental clone library from marine aggregates (AGG53) (similarity, 94.3 to
99.6%). Our results support the hypothesis that many of the most abundant bacterioplankton species are not
readily culturable by standard methods but also show that heterotrophic bacterioplankton that are culturable
on media with high organic contents include many strains for which SSU rDNA sequences are not available in
sequence databases.
The cloning of rRNA genes (rDNAs) from natural ecosys-
tems precipitated a fundamental shift in microbial ecology
away from the study of cultured strains and towards molecular
approaches that emphasized the importance of in situ diversity.
This transition began earlier with the discovery that, in many
ecosystems, bacterial numbers estimated by epifluorescence
direct counts are orders of magnitude higher than those esti-
mated by CFU counts (16, 20). This discrepancy has been
referred to as the great plate count anomaly (31).
Marine microbiologists were quick to recognize the signifi-
cance of the anomalously low plate counts for heterotrophic
bacterioplankton. Faced with uncertainty about the relevance
of cultured species, at an early stage they moved away from
cultivation-based techniques and towards a model that treated
marine bacterioplankton as a functional unit with indistin-
guishable components, sometimes known as the microbial
black box. Later, this view was reinforced by experience with
autotrophic bacterioplankton (cyanobacteria and prochloro-
phytes), which showed that very abundant species could be
difficult to detect and cultivate without the development of
specialized techniques (18, 23, 34). Subsequently, the discovery
that the abundance of culturable species estimated by plate
counts is increased by manipulation and confinement of sea-
water samples (8) led to the formulation of two nonexclusive
hypotheses that could be applied generally to many ecosys-
tems: (i) bacterial communities are composed of known spe-
cies that are capable of forming colonies on agar plates but do
so with low efficiency, and (ii) bacterial communities are com-
posed of unknown species that cannot easily be grown on
common microbiological media (14). The actual explanations
for the failure of cells to form colonies may be as diverse as the
species in consideration, but these two alternative hypotheses
capture the essence of the debate.
Most of the evidence supporting both hypotheses was gath-
ered after the introduction of molecular biology techniques to
aquatic microbial ecology. Hypothesis two was proposed after
the cloning and sequencing of rDNAs from environmental
DNA samples showed that the most common genes recovered
belong to undescribed species and, in some cases, novel groups
of bacteria (5, 10, 12, 29). Since most of the marine bacteria
that have been described in the systematic literature are rep-
resented in rRNA databases (15), these comparisons led to the
conclusion that many marine bacterioplankton species were
unknown because they are difficult to culture (14). However,
the same results could be attributed not to a failure to culture
bacteria because of physiological differences but instead to the
incompleteness of systematic descriptions and small-subunit
(SSU) rDNA sequence databases for cultured marine bacteria.
Rehnstam et al. (27) studied bacteria, cultured on Zobell’s
marine medium, from seawater collected from Scripps pier.
After partially sequencing 16S rRNAs from these isolates, they
developed strain-specific oligonucleotide probes and hybrid-
ized them to genomic DNA isolated from water samples col-
lected from the same area. They concluded that the cultured
strains were indeed significant members of the bacterioplank-
ton community.
In this work, we report the results of a study in which HaeIII
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns
and partial gene sequences were used to compare the SSU
rDNAs of bacterial isolates to bacterial SSU rDNAs cloned

directly from the same sample of Oregon coastal seawater. The
results show that there is little overlap between SSU rDNA
clones and cultured strains from the same water sample. In
addition, we found that many of the cultured strains could not
be identified by SSU rDNA sequence comparisons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Water samples. Subsurface (10-m) water samples were collected in Niskin
bottles at a station located 8 km west of the mouth of Yaquina Bay, Oreg.
(44839.19N, 124810.69W). The water was prescreened through 10-mm Nitex mesh
and transported in autoclaved polyethylene carboys to the laboratory for filtra-
tion and plating.
Isolation of cellular clones. Subsamples (100 ml each) were spread onto 20
marine R2A agar plates and incubated at 158C in the dark in a constant-
temperature incubator. Marine R2A is a complex medium with the same com-
position as R2A medium (26) except that inorganic salts are not added and 75%
seawater is used instead of distilled water. The carbon content of this medium is
lower than that of marine agar but is still orders of magnitude higher than the
carbon content of natural seawater (Table 1). All colonies appearing on 10 plates
over a period of 3 weeks were characterized by several criteria related to colony
morphology and streaked for isolation onto R2A plates. Subsequently, all iso-
lated cellular clones were grown in R2A broth, and a 1-ml aliquot was frozen for
storage in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide at2808C. After the first 3 weeks, only colonies
that had a previously unseen morphology were picked from the 20 plates, up to
a period of 3 months. After 12 months of storage at 2808C, all cellular clones
were inoculated into R2A broth for further experiments. Cellular clones were
assigned the prefix R2A.
Cell counts.Direct counts were performed by epifluorescence microscopy with
DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain cells according to the protocol
described in reference 33, except that the samples were fixed with 1% formal-
dehyde. Most-probable numbers were estimated from the number of CFU ap-
pearing in 10 R2A agar plates in a period of 3 months.
SSU rDNA clone library. Picoplankton from a 16-liter subsample were col-
lected by filtration onto 0.2-mm-pore-size polysulfone filters (Supor-200; Gelman
Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.). Total cellular nucleic acids were isolated from the
picoplankton sample by lysis with proteinase K and sodium dodecyl sulfate,
followed by phenol-chloroform extraction as previously described (13). SSU
rDNAs were amplified from total genomic DNA by PCR using two general
bacterial SSU rDNA primers (27F, 59-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG-39;
1522R, 59-AAG GAG GTG ATC CAN CCR CA-39) (11) in a PTC100 thermal
cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, Mass.). In a final volume of 100 ml, the
reaction mixture contained 0.2 mM each amplification primer, 200 mM each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5.0% acetamide, 10 ng of tem-
plate, and 2.5 U of PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), which was
added after a precycling in which the reaction mixture was heated to 958C for 5
min and held at 808C. Pfu DNA polymerase was used for DNA amplification,
because it exhibits proofreading activity and therefore can replicate DNA with
higher fidelity than Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification conditions were
958C for 1 min, 558C for 1 min, and 728C for 1 min, with extension of the
elongation step by 5 s per cycle for 35 cycles. Following the final cycle, the
reaction was extended at 728C for 10 min. The amplification products from six
reactions were visualized by electrophoresis through a 1.0% SeaKem (FMC,
Rockland, Maine) agarose gel in 13 TAE (40 mM Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA)
containing ethidium bromide (0.50 mg z ml21). For each reaction, the band
corresponding to the correctly sized product (1.5 kb) was cut out of the gel and
purified (24). The resulting products were pooled, quantified with a UV160U
spectrophotometer (Shimazu Co., Kyoto, Japan), and visualized as described
above. The amplified rDNA was inserted into the SmaI restriction site of the
phagemid vector pBluescript KSII2 (Stratagene) by blunt-end ligation as pre-
viously described (12), with the following modifications: the ligation reaction
mixture, consisting of 260 ng of insert, 50 ng of vector, and 1 U of T4 DNA ligase
in ligation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothre-
itol, 0.4 mM ATP), was incubated at 168C overnight. The ligation product was
diluted 2:3 with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) and used to
transform competent Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells (Stratagene). Transfor-
mants were subsequently plated onto LB agar plates (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast
extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1.5% Bacto-agar) containing the antibiotic ampicillin (200
mg z ml21), spread evenly with 40 ml of X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-
galactopyranoside) (40 mg z ml21) and 100 ml of IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thioga-
lactopyranoside) (100 mM), and grown at 378C overnight. Positive (white-colony-
morphotype) transformants were streaked for isolation. For long-term storage,
stab cultures of all were made in LB top agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract,
0.5% NaCl, 0.7% Bacto-agar) and kept at 48C. Clones were also stored in 7.0%
dimethyl sulfoxide at 2808C. Gene clones were assigned the prefix OCS.
RFLP patterns. (i) Cellular clones. Based on their colony morphology, 60
cellular clones were selected for characterization by HaeIII RFLP analysis of
their SSU rDNAs. Briefly, the cellular clones were grown in R2A broth and
harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 620 3 g), and their genomic DNA was
extracted by the CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) (1). The SSU
rDNA of each of the clones was amplified from 10 to 100 ng of genomic DNA
by the PCR. The reaction mixtures contained 0.5 mM bacterial primers 27F and
1522R, 0.2 mM premixed deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1.5 mMMgCl2, and 2.5
U of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wis.) in a final volume of 100 ml.
All PCRs except for the one used to amplify environmental DNA for the
construction of the clone library were performed with Taq DNA polymerase
since all templates originated from a single cellular clone, and so we had no
concern about preferential amplification biases. The DNA polymerase was
added after a precycling step in which the reaction mixture was heated to 958C
for 1 min and held at 808C. The amplification conditions were 1 min at 948C,
1 min at 558C, and 3 min at 728C for 35 cycles. The PCR products were purified
on Qiaquick-spin columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.), and their concentrations
were measured spectrophotometrically as described above. For the determina-
tion of RFLPs, 700 ng of purified PCR product from each cellular clone was
digested with 5 U of the restriction endonuclease HaeIII (Promega) for 5 h. The
reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM. The restriction
fragments were resolved by gel electrophoresis in 3% NuSieve low-melting-point
agarose (FMC) in TAE and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg z ml21).
Photographs of the gels were digitized with an HP ScanJetIIcx scanner (Hewlett
Packard Co., San Diego, Calif.). The images were processed by using Adobe
Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, Calif.).
(ii) Gene clones. All gene clones were characterized by HaeIII RFLPs. Plas-
mids bearing complete inserts, isolated by alkaline lysis, were used as templates
in the amplification of environmental clone SSU rDNAs by the PCR. PCR
conditions were the same as those employed above for the cellular clones, with
the following exceptions. For the precycling step, the gene clones were held at
958C for 5 min instead of 1 min. Also, each reaction mixture contained approx-
imately 20 ng of template plasmid DNA. Since all of the PCRs yielded similar
amounts of product, 7 ml of nonpurified PCR products was digested with 3 U of
the restriction endonuclease HaeIII for 2 h. The restriction fragments were
resolved by gel electrophoresis as described above.
Sequencing. (i) Cellular clones. Sequences were determined for all combina-
tions of RFLP pattern and colony morphology that were unique. An exception
was the most common colony morphotype (colony type I), which presented slight
variations in colony morphology, not all of which were sequenced. rDNA am-
plicons from 32 separate cellular clones were sequenced bidirectionally by using
the primers 27F and 338R by the fluorescent dideoxy termination reaction
(Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, Calif.). The fluorescently labeled frag-
ments were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a model 373A
automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.).
(ii) Gene clones. All gene clones that had unique RFLP patterns were chosen
for sequencing. Briefly, template plasmid DNAs were prepared from overnight
cultures by alkaline lysis using a Prep-A-Gene plasmid purification kit (Bio-Rad,
Richmond, Calif.) or a Qiaprep spin plasmid kit (Qiagen) and quantified spec-
trophotometrically. Plasmid DNAs were visualized by electrophoresis through a
1.0% SeaKem (FMC) agarose gel as described above. Plasmid DNAs were
sequenced bidirectionally with conserved primers as described above, with at
least 500 bases of sequence data on the 59 end of each SSU rDNA molecule
being obtained.
Phylogenetic analyses. Unaligned sequences were submitted to the SIMI-
LARITY_RANK (Simrank) program of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)
to obtain a preliminary list of closest phylogenetic neighbors (21). Simrank
results are expressed as SAB values, the number of shared oligomers of seven
bases divided by either the number of unique oligomers in the submitted se-
quence or the database sequence, whichever is lower. Sequences were then
sorted according to phylum and subphylum affiliation and were manually aligned
with the DNA sequence editor GDE version 2.1 (supplied by Steve Smith). The
consensus sequences were resubmitted to Simrank by employing the
MY_DATABASE option. This allowed us to append the SSU rDNA sequences
available through the RDP database with all cellular and gene clone sequences
obtained from this study. The results were used to sort the sequences into sets of
related phylogeny, from which similarity values between the cellular and gene
clones and their closest relatives were calculated.
Phylogenetic trees were calculated with the neighbor-joining algorithm (28) by
using the program NEIGHBOR of the PHYLIP version 3.5 software (7). Evo-
lutionary distances were calculated by using the program DNADIST and the
Kimura 2-parameter model for nucleotide change, with a transition/transversion

ratio of 2.0 (19). To check the consistency of the resulting tree, random resam-
pling of the sequences (bootstrapping) was performed, and a tree representing a
consensus of 100 trees was obtained (6). Similarities were calculated from partial
sequences by considering all available overlapping regions, with the exclusion of
ambiguous nucleotides.

RESULTS
Cell counts estimated from CFU on marine R2A medium
were orders of magnitude lower than those estimated from
DAPI direct counts. The number of bacteria estimated from
the number of CFU was 72 6 17 ml21, and the number of
bacteria estimated by DAPI direct counts was 2.07 z 106 ml21.
Similar results, not reported here, were obtained with other
media, including Zobell’s marine agar.
Colony morphology was used to sort the cellular clones into
categories, because a majority of the isolates could be de-
scribed by a few recognizable colony morphotypes. Of 127
cellular clones examined, 27 colony morphotypes were identi-
fied. HaeIII RFLPs of SSU rDNAs were determined for 60
cellular clones, with resampling of colony morphologies that
were either very abundant or else nondescript in appearance.
Our reasoning was that variety was more likely to be over-
looked among the nondescript colonies. In general, each col-
ony morphotype was associated with a unique RFLP pattern,
though variation in RFLP patterns was found within 4 of the 27
colony morphotypes (colony types V, VI, IX, and XVIII [Table
2]). In three cases (RFLP types 1, 20, and 26 [Table 2]), cellular
clones with different colony morphologies were found to have
identical RFLP patterns.
A comparison of the HaeIII RFLP patterns of the SSU
rDNAs from the cellular and gene clones showed little overlap.
The gene clone library consisted of 116 full-length SSU rDNA
clones, of which 54 were of plastid origin, 2 were chimeras, and

2 were not identified. The HaeIII RFLP patterns of the re-
maining 58 bacterial gene clones fell into 25 RFLP types, 13 of
which were unique to single clones. Three RFLP patterns were
common to both cellular and gene clones (Fig. 1; Table 3).
Sequence comparisons showed that the cellular and gene
clones with similar RFLP patterns were phylogenetically re-
lated in two of these cases (Table 3).
Sequence comparisons supported the same conclusion
drawn from comparisons of the HaeIII RFLP patterns—that
there was little overlap in the species present in the two sets of
SSU rDNAs. Although RFLP comparisons were determined
for a larger number of cellular clones (n5 60), comparisons of
59-terminal gene sequences from 32 cellular clones provided
greater resolution of genetic differences as well as phylogenetic
identification. Sequencing showed that the cellular clone col-
lection was composed, in order of abundance, of members of
the g and a subdivisions of the class Proteobacteria, members of
the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides line of descent, and mem-
bers of the high- and low-G1C-content gram-positive phyla.
The most common cellular clones, RFLP type 1, accounted
for 80% of the g-Proteobacteria cellular clones (Fig. 2A). The
sequences of the SSU rDNAs of these isolates were identical to
those of the published gene sequence of Azospirillum sp. strain
DSM1727, a member of the Pseudomonas subgroup of the g-
Proteobacteria. As previously mentioned, cellular clone RFLP
type 1 was one of the three cellular clone types with a HaeIII
RFLP pattern matching that of a gene clone. The second-most-
abundant group of g-Proteobacteria cellular clones (RFLP types 4
and 20) were related to the Colwellia assemblage and the
Alteromonas group and were most similar (94.3 to 99.6%) to
the environmental rDNA clone AGG53, isolated from marine
phytodetrital aggregates by DeLong et al. (Fig. 3; Table 2) (5).
The most abundant a-Proteobacteria cellular clones were
members of the Sphingomonas and Roseobacter groups (Fig.
2A), while the majority of the clones affiliated with the cyto-
phaga-flavobacter-bacteroides line of descent were members
of the Vesiculatum and the Cytophaga lytica subgroups. Finally,
the cellular clones belonging to the gram-positive phyla were
members of the Arthrobacter (high-G1C-content) and Bacillus
(low-G1C-content) groups.
The gene clones were, in order of abundance, members of
the g, a, and b subdivisions of the class Proteobacteria and
members of the high-G1C-content gram-positive phylum. All
but one of the g-Proteobacteria clones in the clone library were
members of the SAR86 cluster (22) or closely related to sulfur-
oxidizing symbionts (Fig. 2B; Fig. 3). The remaining g-Pro-
teobacteria gene clone (OCS181) was a member of the Pseudo-
monas subgroup. OCS181 had aHaeIII RFLP pattern identical
to that of the cellular clone RFLP type 1 (Fig. 1) and was
94.6% similar in rDNA sequence to the cellular clone R2A30
(Table 2). Proteobacteria gene clones of the a subdivision were
members of the SAR11 cluster (12) or SAR116 cluster (22) or
were related to the SAR83 cluster within the Rhodobacter
group (Fig. 2B) (2). The high-G1C-content gram-positive
gene clones were members of the BDA1-5 cluster (10, 25).
Simrank comparisons were used to identify nearest phylo-
genetic neighbors. For the majority of cellular clones, the
nearest phylogenetic neighbors formed monophyletic groups
related by high Sab values, thus permitting unambiguous iden-
tification. However, in some cases, the Simrank results were
ambiguous because they were either (i) a polyphyletic list of
organisms with low Sab values relative to that of the submitted
sequence (i.e., R2A55, cellular clone RFLP type 7), or (ii) a list
of uncultured environmental clones with high Sab values rela-
tive to that of the submitted sequence (i.e., R2A57, cellular
clone RFLP type 14). Both cases suggest that the cellular
clones could represent new species.
In general, phylogenetic analyses of partial rDNA sequences
supported the results obtained by Simrank by showing that,
although most of the SSU rDNA sequences from cellular
clones were phylogenetically related to clades of cultured spe-
cies, some were instead closely related to environmental SSU
rDNA clones. In particular, many of the cellular clones be-
longing to the Rhodobacter group were related to environmen-
tal gene clones recovered from seawater (Fig. 4). Also, cellular
clones belonging to the Colwellia assemblage and the Altero-
monas group were closely related to the environmental clone
AGG53 (Fig. 3) (5).
DISCUSSION
The single most important observation reported in this work
is that the genes recovered by cloning techniques and the genes

recovered from bacteria isolated in cultures from the same
water sample were different. Explanations that attribute this
difference to biases in molecular techniques seem unlikely,
since investigations of bacterioplankton diversity by different
gene cloning methods have led to the identification of many of
the same phylogenetic lineages, regardless of the water mass
investigated or the method used for gene cloning (5, 10, 12, 25,
29).
Although the main conclusion of this study is that many
abundant bacterial species in seawater are not easily cultured,
this fact tells only a small part of the story concerning the
relationship between cultured bacteria and the distributions of
bacterioplankton species in nature. The observation that many
of the cellular clones could not be identified by comparisons of
their SSU rDNAs to those in sequence databases indicates
that a significant fraction of the bacterioplankton that can
be grown on organically rich media are not represented in
the databases. This result suggests that microbial cultivation
has not yet been employed exhaustively for determining the
taxonomic identities and distributions of marine bacteria.
However, an alternative explanation is that the unidentified
isolates are among the ca. 26% of systematically described
marine bacterial species that are not yet represented in rDNA
sequence databases (15). In either case, the results clearly
point to a need for further investigations of the systematics of
the marine heterotrophic bacteria which easily can be culti-
vated on common microbiological media that have high or-
ganic carbon contents.
The application of innovative culturing methods, such as
seawater culture, that more accurately recreate the physical
and chemical conditions found in the ocean, are likely to lead
to the cultivation of microbial strains that cannot be grown on
organically rich media such as the marine R2A medium we
employed in this study (3, 30). Nature harbors microbial spe-
cies with diverse growth requirements; no single cultivation
medium could be expected to culture a majority of these spe-
cies. Seawater culture has yielded isolates of heterotrophic
bacteria, oligotrophs, that cannot be grown on organically rich
marine media (3, 17, 30). However, so far there have been no
reports of seawater culture methods being used successfully to
culture microbial species corresponding to the 16S rDNAs
recovered most frequently from seawater by molecular tech-
niques. In light of these observations, it seems appropriate to
regard bacteria as occupying a physiological continuum which
may render them more or less amenable to cultivation. Thus,
the terms culturable and unculturable, although convenient,
have meaning relevant only to particular, defined experimental
conditions.

A third point to emerge from the comparisons we present is
that the gene sequences of culturable microbes recovered from
seawater in some cases are very similar but not identical to the
rDNA sequences of closely related species. The significance of
this variation is difficult to determine at this time. There is no
exact relationship between SSU rDNA sequence similarity and
taxonomic divisions. Furthermore, there is little comprehen-
sive information available on rDNA variability within taxo-
nomic groups, such as among strains of a species defined by
phenotypic criteria (4). Gene clusters are observed commonly
among 16S rDNA clones retrieved from environmental nucleic
acids; the issue of physiological variability among the closely
related strains represented by these sequence clusters may
be of considerable significance to microbial ecologists inter-
ested in investigating microbial distribution with gene probes
(4, 9).
Our investigation uncovered some cultured isolates that are
closely related to microbial species that previously had been
described only from environmental clone libraries (e.g., isolate
R2A81 and clone AGG53 [similarity, 99.6%]). Interestingly,
these isolates, which correspond to 16S rDNAs recovered from
marine aggregates, flocculate in suspension. These strains,
which remain unidentified at a systematic level, may be of use
as laboratory models for investigating the mechanisms of ma-
rine microaggregate formation.
Despite the challenges of culturing some recalcitrant spe-
cies, the isolation and identification of representative marine
bacterioplankton strains remains an indispensable source of
physiological and genetic information about marine microbes.
Phylogenetic trees can be highly informative; nonetheless,
many metabolic pathways in bacteria are polyphyletically dis-
tributed, thereby limiting inferences about the biogeochemical
impact of bacterioplankton based on rDNA sequence compar-
isons alone. Partial genomic DNA sequences retrieved from
nature offer one means of obtaining more information about
uncultured species. In a recent study, this approach was used to
study group I marine crenarchaeotes (32).
It was not the aim of this study to develop innovative cul-
turing techniques. Instead, this study was based on the ap-
plication of those methods used most routinely in marine
microbiology to recover bacterial species from seawater. None-
theless, among the bacterial isolates recovered were many that
appeared to constitute new microbial species by the criterion
of SSU rRNA comparisons. In this light, we might regard
genetic investigations of microbial diversity as successful not
just because they employ novel methods, but also because they
have invited renewed scrutiny of a fertile problem.
