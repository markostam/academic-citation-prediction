[1] We evaluate three metrics representing the drivers of channel change downstream
from dams. A balance between changes in sediment supply and transport capacity
identifies conditions of sediment deficit or surplus. A Shields number represents the
competence of postdam flows and the potential for incision under conditions of sediment
deficit. A ratio of postdam to predam flood discharge provides a metric for the scale and
rate of channel change, especially width. The metrics are calculated for more than
4000 km of some of the major rivers in the western United States. More than 60% of these
rivers are in sediment deficit, and only a few reaches are in sediment surplus. The
sediment balance can be used to assess the relative effort involved in reversing undesired
conditions of deficit or surplus.

1. Introduction
[2] Large dams disrupt flow and sediment delivery
downstream, thereby inducing channel change that may
extend hundreds of kilometers [Stevens, 1938; Borland and
Miller, 1960; Schumm, 1969; Petts, 1979; Williams and
Wolman, 1984; Andrews, 1986; Carling, 1988; Brandt,
2000a; Grant et al., 2003]. Some of these channel changes
adversely impact cities and towns, agriculture, native riv-
erine ecosystems, and valued landscapes. Environmental
management programs now attempt to reverse some unde-
sired channel changes. Because these programs require
substantial resources, it is appropriate for the scientific
community to provide managers and decision makers with
tools to evaluate the factors that cause channel change.
Better understanding of the factors that drive channel
change might provide a rational basis for distributing scarce
national resources to the various programs that attempt river
rehabilitation.
[3] In this paper, we propose three metrics that comprise
a framework within which the primary drivers of channel
change can be assessed. One metric represents the shift in
balance between sediment supply and transport capacity
and, thus, the tendency for sediment to accumulate or
evacuate downstream from dams. Another metric character-
izes the postdam stream competence and, hence, potential
for channel incision. The third metric is the relative reduc-
tion in flood magnitude. Channel incision and flood reduc-
tion typically alter the inundation frequency of the predam
floodplain, thereby restructuring the disturbance regime and
physical template of the riparian ecosystem. Flood reduction
is also an important determinant of channel narrowing and
the extent to which riparian vegetation invades the postdam
channel. We compute these metrics for 61 dam-impacted
reaches of five large river systems in the western United
States, and we evaluate the utility of these metrics in
characterizing channel change by comparison with field
measurements. We also discuss the application of these
metrics in prioritizing river rehabilitation challenges.
2. Previous Studies
[4] Williams and Wolman [1984] summarized channel
change in degrading reaches downstream from 21 dams in
the western United States and developed empirical relations
to predict the duration of incision and the magnitude of
changes in channel width. They predicted that more than
100 years will be necessary to achieve maximum incision
downstream from some dams. They did not attempt to
predict the reach length over which degradation occurs
nor where degradation gives way to aggradation further
downstream. In addition, Williams and Wolman [1984] did
not explicitly characterize the relative change in streamflow
and sediment delivery that caused the channel changes they
described.
[5] Throughout this paper, we use the term degradation to
mean all processes by which sediment is evacuated from a
reach. We use the term incision to specifically mean large-
scale lowering of the bed profile. Thus, incision is only one
component of degradation; other components include win-
nowing of the bed, pool scour without associated lowering
of the longitudinal profile, and erosion of bars. We use the
term aggradation to mean the general process whereby
sediment accumulates in a reach and may, or may not,
include changes in bed elevation.
[6] Metrics have been proposed to describe dam-induced
disruption of streamflow [Richter et al., 1996; Magilligan et
al., 2003; Magilligan and Nislow, 2005; White et al., 2005].
Brandt [2000a] summarized a large number of case studies
and identified nine styles of channel change involving
either degradation or aggradation. He recognized the
applicability of Lane’s [1955] conceptualization of the

interconnected role played by channel slope, discharge,
and the rate and caliber of the sediment supply, but he did
not evaluate the magnitude of sediment deficit or surplus
that arises from different combinations of flow and sedi-
ment supply regulation.
[7] Brandt [2000b] and Grant et al. [2003] suggested
metrics that consider changes in both water and sediment
supply. Brandt [2000b] predicted postdam channel form
from regime, bed entrainment, sediment transport, extremal
hypothesis, hydraulic geometry, and empirical relations.
The accuracy of Brandt’s [2000b] method depends on fitted
parameters that may not apply generally, and the method’s
complexity makes it difficult to apply widely. Grant et al.
[2003] explicitly evaluated relative changes in flow and
sediment delivery. They suggested that channel change is
related to changes in the fractional change in duration of
sediment-transporting flows and the ratio of sediment sup-
ply downstream from the dam to the supply upstream from
the dam. They applied these metrics to explain channel
change on the Green and Colorado Rivers downstream from
Flaming Gorge and Glen Canyon Dams, respectively, and
on the Deschutes River.
3. Metrics
[8] The primary channel response to dams is either
degradation or aggradation, as defined above. These funda-
mentally different responses are driven by the postdam
sediment mass balance that is perturbed into either deficit
or surplus. We quantified this perturbation using a simple
relation originally suggested by Henderson [1966]. This
metric is insufficient, however, to characterize whether or
not incision occurs, because incision takes place only if the
postdam mass balance is in deficit and postdam floods can
entrain the bed. We propose a Shields number as a suitable
metric to describe the competence of postdam floods to
entrain the bed and thereby to describe the drivers of
incision. The third metric, the magnitude of flood reduction,
has been previously proposed [Magilligan et al., 2003;
Magilligan and Nislow, 2005].
[9] To be useful, it is important that these metrics be
reliably estimated from available data. Because data used in
regional analysis are often of wide-ranging accuracy and
precision, it is desirable that metrics not be highly sensitive
to uncertainty in input parameters. Metrics that are comput-
ed from estimates of proportional change of predam to
postdam conditions are more desirable than metrics based
on absolute values, because data describing proportional
change in hydrology or sediment supply are typically more
accurate than are the absolute values themselves. Reliable
information on sediment supply and grain size is often
difficult to identify, but the sign and approximate magnitude
of these changes can typically be estimated.
3.1. Sediment Mass Balance
[10] Change in the sediment mass balance is caused by
the relative alteration of the water flux and sediment supply.
Prediction of the postdam mass balance is inspired by the
widely cited proportionality of Lane [1955]
QsD / QS ð1Þ
where Qs is the rate of sediment supply and D is its grain
size, Q is water discharge, and S is channel slope. A
quantitative approximation of this proportionality may be
developed by combining equations for momentum, con-
tinuity, flow resistance, and transport rate. Henderson
[1966, pp. 448–450] developed a simple combination
using the Einstein-Brown transport formula, Chezy flow
resistance formula, one-dimensional form of the momentum
equation for steady uniform flow, and definition of specific
discharge. For this formulation, constants representing
water and sediment properties and gravitational acceleration
cancel and can be disregarded. The Einstein-Brown
transport relation is
qs* / t*3 ð2Þ
where qs* is the dimensionless transport rate
qs* / qs
D3=2
ð3Þ
and qs is the unit sediment transport rate. The Shields
number t* is
t* / t
D
ð4Þ
where t is the boundary shear stress. The one-dimensional
form of the momentum equation for steady, uniform flow
is
t / RS ð5Þ
The Chezy flow resistance formula is
U /
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
RS
p
ð6Þ
where U is the mean velocity. Specific discharge is
q ¼ UR ð7Þ
where
R  h ð8Þ
for wide channels and h is the flow depth. Combining (2)
through (8) yields
S /
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
qs
p
D0:75
q
ð9Þ
If qs and D represent the rate and caliber of the sediment
supply, then S represents the slope needed to transport that
supply at a flow rate of q. Writing (9) twice, for the same
reach under predam and postdam conditions, and taking
the ratio gives

Values of S* indicate a potential for degradation or
aggradation in response to changes in flow and sediment
supply. Values of S* > 1 indicate that an increase in slope
is needed to transport the postdam sediment supply with
the specified change in flow. Thus, there is too much
supply for the predam slope, and a postdam condition of
sediment surplus is predicted. Values of S* < 1 indicate
that that predam slope is larger than needed to transport
the postdam sediment supply with the specified change in
flow, and a condition of sediment deficit is predicted.
[11] Equation (12) is particularly useful in cases where
(1) is indeterminate, which is common in analyzing the
effects of dams, because both flow regime and sediment
supply are altered. In addition, (12) relies on estimates of
the ratio of predam to postdam values, which are easier to
estimate than the individual values.
[12] Some imprecision is unavoidable because of approx-
imations made in deriving (12). Even the most precise and
accurate calculation of S* is an approximation of the
postdam sediment mass balance, which is calculated by
I  E ¼ DS ð13Þ
where I in the influx of sediment, E is the efflux of
sediment, and DS is the change in storage of sediment that
occurs by channel change.
[13] The choice of resistance relation has a small effect on
S*. We compared values of S* for R0.5, as in (6), and for
R0.67, as in the Manning relation. S* is not significantly
different for either case (Figure 1). The slope of the transport
relation, i.e., the exponent on t* in (2), has a greater
influence on S*, especially where Q* > 0.5 and Qs*/D* <
0.3. A value of 3, as given in (2), is representative of rivers
whose sediment supply is primarily sand and fine gravel and
is a reasonable characterization of the large rivers described
in this study. Larger values of the exponent are appropriate
where the sediment supply is primarily coarse gravel. A
relatively large value of 8 is used for comparison in Figure 1.
For the same value of Q*, the Einstein-Brown relation, as
given in (2), predicts S* > 1 for smaller values ofQs*/D* and
is thus a conservative prediction of postdam sediment deficit.
[14] It is difficult to precisely determine changes in the
average grain size of the total sediment supply, because the
grain size of each component should be considered in
relation to its proportion of the average flux. Examination
of (12) reveals that the role of D* is intermediate to that of
changes in streamflow and sediment supply. Uncertainty in
D* of ±10% results in an uncertainty in S* of 7.5%.
Uncertainty in D* has no effect on characterizing general
conditions of sediment deficit (S* < 1) or surplus (S* > 1) ifﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Qs
p
/Q* < 0.5 or
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Qs
p
/Q* > 1.7 (Figure 2). In those cases
where the direction of change in grain size of the supply is
known, i.e., fining or coarsening, but the magnitude of the
change is unknown, the effect of uncertainty in D* is further
reduced. Within the range of D* typical of this study,
uncertainty in D* is of concern where
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Qs
p
/Q* < 1.2
(Figure 2). Where
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Qs
p
/Q* was within this range, we
considered the value of S* indeterminate for distinguishing
sediment deficit or surplus.
3.2. Bed Incision Potential
[15] Sediment deficit is a necessary, but insufficient,
determinant of bed incision. The occurrence and extent of
incision also depends on whether postdam flows are com-
petent to move streambed material. If flows are not com-
petent, then evacuation of sediment occurs by other
processes, but incision cannot take place. In some cases, it
is important to make a distinction between the overall grain
size of the bed material and the grain size of bed features
that act as hydraulic controls. For example, in debris fan-
affected rivers where the average bed material may be sand
but the bed profile is controlled by boulder rapids, the
potential for widespread incision is controlled by the mo-
bility of the bed of the rapids [Schmidt and Rubin, 1995;
Grams and Schmidt, 1999].
Figure 1. Sensitivity of the threshold between sediment
deficit and sediment surplus, i.e., S* = 1, to parameters used
in the derivation of (12). Thin lines indicate S* = 1, where
exponent of R in (6) is 0.67, and thick lines indicate 0.5.
Solid lines indicate S* = 1, where the exponent in (2) is 3,
which is appropriate where sand and fine gravel are the
dominant sediment supply. Dashed lines indicate an
exponent of 8, which is appropriate where coarse gravel is
the dominant sediment supply. The crosses show the values
of reaches listed in Table 1. The thick solid line is
equation (12). The equation of the thin solid line is S* /
qs *0.48 D*0.71/q0.86. The equation of the thick dashed
line is S* / qs *0.19 D*1.22/q. The equation of the thin
dashed line is S* / qs *0.18 D*1.16/q0.86.

[16] The potential for incision at the time of dam closure
can be described by a Shields number, t*
t* / hpostSpre
DB
ð14Þ
where hpost is the mean depth of postdam floods, Spre is the
slope of the channel at the time of dam completion, and DB
is a characteristic bed grain size at the time of dam
completion. We compared calculated values of t* with field
measurements of incision to evaluate the possibility of a
threshold value of t* above which significant incision had
occurred. No attempt was made to predict the magnitude,
rate, or duration of incision, because these attributes of
incision are determined by the magnitude of sediment
deficit, the magnitude and timing of postdam flood releases,
and the stratigraphy of the substrate [Grams et al., 2007].
3.3. Flood Reduction
[17] Although sediment deficit and surplus determine
whether a channel evacuates or accumulates sediment, the
rate and type of channel change will also depend on the
magnitude of flood flow reduction. The role of flood regime
changes in causing channel change independent from
changes in S* is anticipated by the broad correlation
between flow and width represented in the downstream
hydraulic geometry [Leopold and Maddock, 1953]. Inspec-
tion of (12) indicates that identical values of S* may be
achieved for different combinations of change in flood
magnitude and sediment supply, but small values of Q*
also anticipate decrease in channel dimensions even where
S* = 1. This suggests the need for a metric that scales the
magnitude of flood reduction. We used a ratio of predam to
postdam 2-year flood as an index of change in flood
magnitude. Reduction in flood magnitude can also promote
vegetation establishment in the predam channel, which can
accelerate the rate of channel narrowing and reduce the
ability of postdam floods to maintain a larger channel
[Johnson, 1994, 1998].
4. Application of the Metrics to Large Rivers
of the Western United States
[18] We summarized conditions of some dam-affected
western U.S. rivers where data for flow, sediment supply,
and channel change are available: Missouri River, Rio
Grande, Colorado River, Trinity River, Snake River, and
Deschutes River (Table 1). The Missouri River, Rio Grande,
Colorado River, and Snake River drain the Rocky Moun-
tains and adjacent semiarid regions; annual floods typically
are caused by spring snowmelt. The Trinity and Deschutes
Rivers drain the Coast Range and Cascade Mountains, and
their flood regime is caused by winter rain as well as spring
snowmelt. The dams and reservoirs that we evaluated were
all constructed on rivers except Jackson Lake Dam on the
Snake River where the dam raised the stage of an existing
lake dammed by Pleistocene moraines. Many parts of these
rivers are the focus of rehabilitation programs and have
been the subject of extensive channel monitoring and
measurement of hydrology and sediment transport. Predam
bed material of the Missouri River, Rio Grande, and parts of
the Colorado River system was sand. The predam bed of the
upper Colorado, Trinity, Snake, and Deschutes Rivers was
gravel.
[19] Compilation of data from different rivers and studies
necessarily involves integration of information for differing
time periods, spatial resolutions, and antecedent conditions.
We describe the sources, precision, and accuracy of the data
for each reach as auxiliary material1. We summarize some
of the broader issues associated with our compilation of data
below.
4.1. Definition of Reaches
[20] The reaches that we defined varied greatly in length
(Table 1). The primary criterion used to define each reach
was the availability of data with which to describe flow,
sediment supply, channel characteristics, and channel
change. In some cases, longitudinal changes in these factors
or characteristics are well described, and we defined some
relatively short reaches; this was not possible elsewhere.
Typically, the most upstream reach extended from the dam
to the first large tributary. Further downstream, the bound-
aries of reaches were defined by large tributaries or signif-
icant changes in channel geomorphology. In some cases,
data were only available for short reaches near gauging
stations.
4.2. Definition of Time Periods
[21] The lengths of predam and postdam periods were
defined by available data. The periods for different data
typically do not coincide, and we sought to define periods
for flow and sediment supply that were most similar. We
used data describing channel characteristics just before dam
construction and at the end of the postdam period. In the
case of the postdam period, we sought to only use data that
isolated the impacts of specific dams.
[22] In the case of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico,
we summarized data for similar reaches for two time
Figure 2. Sensitivity of S* to differences in D*. The
vertical axis reflects the combined effect of changes in floods
and sediment supply, as formulated in (12). Curved lines are
different values of S*. The range of values for the regulated
rivers described in this paper is shown as a dashed box.

W04404 SCHMIDT AND WILCOCK: METRICS FOR ASSESSING EFFECTS OF DAMS W04404
periods. One period evaluated the impact of dams con-
structed prior to the 1950s, and the other period allowed
evaluation of the impact of Cochiti Dam, completed in 1973,
through 1992 when more recently completed facilities com-
plicate the patterns of channel change. In the case of the Rio
Grande between Elephant Butte Dam and Fort Quitman, TX,
we ended the postdam period in 1932, because extensive
channelization and levee construction occurred thereafter.
Similarly, the Colorado River downstream fromHoover Dam
was channelized near Needles and Topock, CA, in the 1960s.
4.3. Hydrology
[23] We used the 2-year recurrence flood, Q2, to represent
Q* in (12), as well as for calculating the magnitude of flood
reduction (Tables 2a and 2b). Where not available from
published sources, Q2 was computed for the most upstream
gauging station within the reach. We considered changes in
the 2-year flood to be a surrogate for changes in the entire
flow regime [Magilligan et al., 2003], although others have
advocated analysis of changes in mean annual discharge
[Brandt, 2000a], bankfull discharge [Brandt, 2000a] or the
duration that flows exceed the threshold of entrainment of a
reference grain size [Grant et al., 2003]. Use of one flow
statistic obviously simplifies the complexity of actual dam
releases that may include a range of different flows, including
an initial period of sustained low flows for reservoir filling,
high releases due to high runoff into full reservoirs, daily and
seasonal cycles associated with hydroelectric energy produc-
tion or downstream water demands, and extractions of
streamflow for irrigation or transbasin diversion [Richter et
al., 1996; Topping et al., 2003; White et al., 2005].
4.4. Sediment Supply
[24] We used the mean annual sediment supply, Qs, in
(12). There is wide variation in the precision and nature of
sediment supply data. In the cases of the Missouri River
downstream from Garrison Dam, Green River downstream
from Flaming Gorge Dam, and the Colorado River down-
stream from Glen Canyon Dam, annual average tributary
loads, as well as the loads at main stem gauges, were
calculated and the average annual sediment supply is
explicitly known. In other cases, only the average annual
load at a gauge at the upstream end of the reach is known,
and we assumed no significant sediment supply from
ungauged tributaries. In these cases, we could not distin-
guish between sediment delivered by upstream tributaries
and sediment evacuated from the channel upstream from the
reach. Sediment supplied from tributaries determines the
long-term sediment mass balance, but sediment supplied
from main stem evacuation represents a complex, down-
stream-migrating transient condition. In a few cases, the
absolute values of supply are not known, but the ratio of
postdam to predam sediment supply could be estimated.
[25] The estimates of postdam sediment mass balance are
for total or suspended load and generally refer to sand and
finer sizes. Although suspended load data are often used to
assess channel change [Nash, 1994], change in suspended
load does not fully capture the cause of channel change
where the bed is coarse, even where bed material load
comprises a small proportion of the total load. None of the
data are explicitly for bed material load.
[26] Estimates of sediment loads are generally imprecise,
and we conducted no new analyses of these estimates. For
example, published estimates of the predam annual sus-
pended sediment load of the Green River at Jensen, UT
[Andrews, 1986; Grams and Schmidt, 2002, 2005], vary
±6.5%. Estimates of postdam annual suspended sediment
loads at the same gauge vary ±2%. Published estimates of
total suspended loads at Green River, UT, have greater
uncertainty. Thompson’s [1984] estimate of the predam
load, 17.7 	 106 Mg/a, is 15% greater than Andrews’
[1986] estimate for the same period, but Thompson’s
[1984] estimate of the postdam load is 1.5% less than that
of Andrews [1986]. Horowitz [2003, Table III) demonstrated
that the estimated annual suspended sediment flux of the
lower Missouri River at Hermann, MO, between 1996 and
2000 varied ±24% depending on which suspended sediment
rating curve is used to estimate the annual load. Topping et
al. [2000] and Grams and Schmidt [2005] demonstrated
larger errors in estimating annual loads of the Colorado
River and Green River, respectively.
[27] There are sufficient data for the Missouri River
downstream from Garrison Dam [Keown et al., 1981;
Berkas, 1995; Macek-Rowland, 2000; U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, 2000] and the Green River downstream from
Flaming Gorge Dam [Grams and Schmidt, 2005] to estimate
the average grain size of the sediment supply from tributary
sediment transport measurements, weighted by the propor-
tion supplied from each tributary and from bank erosion. In
the case of the Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck
[Simon et al., 1999; Biedenharn et al., 2001] and Gavins
Point Dams [Biedenharn et al., 2001; WEST Consultants,
2002], the grain size of banks that are the primary sediment
supply was compared with the predam bed material size that
was assumed to represent the average grain size of the
predam supply. In the case of reaches where aggradation
had occurred, we assumed that the ratio of predam to
postdam bed material size represented the proportional
change in grain size of the supply. Elsewhere, we did not
have data describing changes in the texture of sediment
supplied to each reach, and we assumed that D* = 1. We also
made this assumption where the primary supply was derived
from bed incision immediately upstream, although we rec-
ognize that this is a transitory characteristic of the supply.
[28] Complex relations among dam operations, sediment
supply, and sediment transport exist, and use of any unique
reference grain size oversimplifies the effects of supply
limitation [Topping et al., 2000] and mixed grain size on
transport rates [Wilcock and Kenworthy, 2002; Curran and
Wilcock, 2005]. For example, suspended sand concentration
of the Colorado River downstream from Glen Canyon Dam
varies over more than an order of magnitude depending on
the distribution and grain size of the bed [Rubin and
Topping, 2001]. The postdam sediment mass balance of
the Colorado River in Grand Canyon computed from a
stationary sediment transport relation and mean daily dis-
charge indicates that a surplus of fine sediment exists during
years of average dam releases, but the mass balance
computed from shifting transport relations developed from
instantaneous transport data demonstrates that there is
actually sediment deficit [Topping et al., 2000; Rubin et
al., 2002; Hazel et al., 2006].
4.5. Channel Characteristics
[29] Predam and postdam reach-average slopes were
reported (Tables 2a and 2b). In some cases, these data were

measured, and elsewhere they were computed from tables or
graphs of water surface profiles. D* was reported for the
fine grain sediment supply. DB was estimated as the grain
size in bed features that create hydraulic controls in debris
fan-affected rivers, and for the grain size of the entire bed of
alluvial rivers. Mean flow depth in (14) was estimated using
the postdam Q2 from recent streamflow measurements, as
reported by the U.S. Geological Survey at gauges in, or
near, each reach. We represented the magnitude of measured
bed incision with a single reach-averaged value for each
case, consistent with the reach-scale level of the approxi-
mate analysis.
5. Results
5.1. Postdam Sediment Mass Balance
[30] Dams have caused a wide range of changes in
sediment mass balance due to various combinations of
change of flood magnitude and sediment supply (Figure 3).
Conditions of sediment deficit or surplus are pervasive
downstream from dams (Figure 4) and 0.08 < S* < 1.61
(Table 1). Of more than 4000 km of regulated river evaluated
in this paper, approximately 67% is in deficit and 4% is in
surplus. The lowest S* occurs immediately downstream from
the Pelton–Round Butte complex on the Deschutes River

where the postdam flood regime is no different than the
predam regime and all sediment from the upstream water-
shed is trapped in reservoirs (Table 1). Large deficits also
occur immediately downstream from other large dams,
except at Jackson Lake Dam where sediment delivery has
not changed. The mass balance is in equilibrium or is
indeterminate, due to uncertainty in D*, in 29% of the
evaluated river length.
[31] There is good agreement with the locations of
degradation or aggradation measured in the field. In cases
where there are large depletions of stream flow, such as on
the Rio Grande downstream from Elephant Butte Dam, Q*
does not adequately characterize changes in flow regime.
Here, large sediment surplus is not predicted but significant
aggradation has been measured [Everitt, 1993]. S* agrees
well with the measured volume of sediment evacuated or
accumulated downstream from Hoover and Parker Dams on
the lower Colorado River (Figure 5). Degradation of the
Missouri River near Bismark, ND, is predicted, but aggra-
dation has occurred because of backwater effects of Oahe
Reservoir, located immediately downstream [U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, 2004].
[32] There is good agreement between S* and the rela-
tively few detailed postdam sediment budgets based on
(13). Deficit conditions in the Colorado River within
100 km downstream from Glen Canyon Dam agree with
the sediment budgets of Topping et al. [2000], Schmidt et al.
[2004], and Hazel et al. [2006]. Estimates of deficit and
equilibrium are also in agreement with those of Grams and

Schmidt [2005] for parts of the Green River downstream
from Flaming Gorge Dam.
[33] Individual dams can cause different perturbations in
sediment mass balance at different locations downstream,
and reaches at the same distance downstream from different
dams are perturbed to different degrees (Figure 6). S*
typically increases in the downstream direction, because
Qs* increases at a greater rate than Q*. This is the situation
for the Rio Grande, upper Colorado River, and Green River,
where the sediment deficit is eliminated or reversed in the
most downstream parts of each river. In contrast, S*
becomes more negative on the Missouri River downstream
from Gavins Point Dam, because Q* increases from 0.62 to
1.19, but Qs* only increases from 0.13 to 0.29.

[34] Sediment surplus is predicted over a wide range of
Qs*, emphasizing that the postdam sediment mass balance
depends on relative changes in flow and sediment supply.
Surplus conditions occur on part of the Trinity River, where
Qs* = 0.13, and Q* = 0.15. Surplus conditions also occur
on parts of the upper Colorado, Gunnison, and Snake Rivers
where 0.75 < Qs* < 1 and 0.55 < Q* < 0.85.
[35] In a few cases, Q* > 1. These circumstances occur on
part of the Rio Grande downstream from Cochiti Dam and
on the most downstream part of the lower Missouri River
(Table 1). Although not evaluated here, this ratio is also
greater than one where streamflow is augmented by trans-
basin diversions [Kellerhals et al., 1979]. Since augmenta-
tion of sediment is not known to occur in coordination with
flow augmentation, examination of (12) and Figure 3
indicates that all flow-augmented streams must be in sed-
iment deficit.
5.2. Bed Incision Potential
[36] The metric t* indicates the potential for bed incision.
Under conditions of deficit, significant incision has oc-
curred where t* > 0.1 and S* > 1. Insignificant incision
has occurred where t* < 0.1 (Figure 7). The magnitude of
bed incision for large values of t* is highly variable,
because of differences in substrate, time since dam comple-

tion, and magnitude of dam releases [Williams and Wolman,
1984].
[37] Distinction between reaches subject to incision and
those where incision has not occurred is consistent with
published observations on the Rio Grande [Lagasse, 1981]
and lower Colorado Rivers [Stevens, 1938]. Even under
conditions of severe sediment deficit, incision has not
occurred where the bed is very coarse, such as the debris
fan-affected part of the Green River immediately down-
stream from Flaming Gorge Dam [Grams and Schmidt,
2005] and in the debris fan-affected Colorado River in
Grand Canyon beginning approximately 25 km downstream
from Glen Canyon Dam. In fact, aggradation of coarse
sediment has occurred in some of Grand Canyon’s rapids
[Howard and Dolan, 1981; Magirl et al., 2005], even
though S* < 1 for fine sediment. In contrast to the relatively
short distance over which incision has occurred downstream
from Glen Canyon Dam, incision occurred far downstream
on streams where S* < 1 and where the predam bed was
sand, such as on the Missouri River, throughout most of the
Rio Grande in central New Mexico, and on the lower
Colorado River.
5.3. Flood Reduction
[38] The range in Q* is wide, 0.15 < Q* < 1.19,
consistent with the many purposes of dams; Magilligan
and Nislow [2005] reported an even wider range. No
consistent trend is evident between channel narrowing and
Q* (Figure 8a), although extreme narrowing to less than
60% of the predam width is observed only where Q* < 0.4.
Also, the greatest degree of channel narrowing has occurred
where t* > 0.1, suggesting that significant channel narrow-
ing also occurs where beds significantly incise (Figure 8b).
Variability in the magnitude of channel narrowing is due to
many factors, including the time available for inset flood-
plains to form and the availability of a postdam fine
sediment supply with which to build a new floodplain.
There may not be any fine sediment available for postdam
floodplain formation immediately downstream from some
dams. In these cases, channel width is mostly determined by
geotechnical properties of the valley alluvium [Shields et
al., 2000].
6. Reversing Undesired Conditions
[39] Although some degree of channel change may be
considered an acceptable cost of water development, large
amounts of degradation or aggradation, bed incision, or
channel narrowing are clearly undesirable in some situations
and become the focus of river rehabilitation efforts. This is
especially the case where the regulated river segments are
relatively long, retain significant natural resources, are not
channelized or leveed, are designated as critical endangered
species habitat, are designated as wild or scenic, or cross
units of the National Park Service. This is the case in parts
of the Missouri River and Rio Grande, throughout the
Colorado River basin upstream from Hoover Dam, on the
Trinity River, the Snake River, and the Deschutes River.
[40] The national scope, investment, and need to priori-
tize rehabilitation of large, regulated rivers provide incen-
tive to compare the effort necessary to reverse undesired
channel conditions downstream from dams. Regional com-
parisons are especially important where the costs of several
rivers targeted for rehabilitation are paid by the same power
consumers or taxpayers. This is the case for many of the
dams in the western United States, because the hydroelec-
tricity produced at these dams is linked by an integrated
transmission system and the same pool of ratepayers. Thus,
it may be useful to ask where investment in river rehabil-
itation will give the greatest return. Might the same effort

function of (a) t* and (b) S*. Values of t* have a bimodal
distribution. Approximately 25% of the reaches have t* <
0.1, and t* > 0.1 for other reaches. Values of S* < 1 and
t* > 0.4 are necessary, but not sufficient, to produce
significant bed incision. Other factors include the duration,
magnitude, and frequency of postdam flows capable of
moving substantial amounts of sediment. In Figure 7a,
symbols are the same as those used in Figure 3. In Figure
7b, symbols distinguish between t* < 0.06 and t* > 0.4.

achieve a greater degree of rehabilitation in some places
rather than others?
[41] There are three general strategies to reverse unde-
sired channel conditions: changing the release pattern of
water, altering the supply of downstream sediment, and
physically manipulating the downstream channel and/or its
riparian vegetation. Each strategy includes a range of
practices that have been implemented with varying degrees
of enthusiasm, cost, and frequency, and the mix of strategies
depend on whether the postdam sediment mass balance is
sediment deficit or surplus.
[42] The postdam sediment mass balance defined in (12)
provides a basis with which to assess the relative effort of
remediating deficit or surplus in different reaches. There is
an infinite combination of possibilities whereby augmenta-
tion of the sediment supply and increase of the flood regime
would achieve postdam sediment mass balance. Strategies
that increase flood flows to rivers in sediment surplus or that
add sediment to rivers in deficit rehabilitate regulated rivers
toward their predisturbance, or wild, condition (Figure 9).
Strategies that decrease sediment supply to rivers in surplus
or decrease flood flows to rivers in deficit shift regulated
rivers toward miniaturized conditions. Because native riv-
erine ecosystems depend on a range of attributes of natural
hydrographs [Poff et al., 1997], shifting a river into postdam
sediment balance while also shifting the flow regime toward
its predisturbance scale is desirable where rehabilitation of
native ecosystems is desired.
[43] We assessed the relative magnitude of prescriptive
actions whose goals are to achieve postdam sediment mass
balance and also to avoid further channel minimization.
Thus, we estimated the proportional increase in sediment
supply or flood flows necessary to return each reach to
postdam sediment equilibrium along paths indicated by
solid lines in Figure 9. Estimates were made by adjusting
the value of Q* or Qs* in (12) such that S* = 1.
[44] The proportional increase in sediment supply neces-
sary to reverse deficit is quite large in many cases and
Figure 8. Average change in channel width as a function of
(a)Q* and (b) t*. Small values ofQ* (<0.4) and large values
of t* (>0.4) are necessary, but not sufficient, requirements
for very large (>50%) reduction of channel width. Other
factors include the availability of riparian vegetation for
colonization of new floodplain deposits and the timing and
frequency of postdam flows capable of preventing in-
channel establishment of vegetation. In Figure 8a, symbols
are the same as those used in Figure 3. In Figure 8b, symbols
distinguish between Q* < 0.4 and Q* > 0.4.

ranges between 70 and 1,440% (Table 3). The proportional
increase in flood magnitudes appropriate for reversal of
sediment surplus is smaller, between 20 and 60%, but there
are fewer of these reaches. Where the magnitude of change
in flood regime to reverse sediment surplus is relatively
small, these changes may be achievable without changing
the reservoir release infrastructure of the dam. The costs of
increasing flood magnitude are probably smaller than the
costs of sediment augmentation, because increased flood
flows commonly can be accommodated without redesign of
reservoir release structures. Nevertheless, reintroduction of
flood flows involves loss of some hydroelectric power
production.
[45] Many deficit segments require large proportional
increases in sediment delivery. Typically, significant infra-
structure changes are necessary to implement this manage-
ment option. For example, application of (12) to the
Colorado River in Grand Canyon indicates that augmenting
the postdam annual fine sediment supply with an additional
7.9 	 106 Mg/a would eliminate deficit conditions with no
change in the flood regime. This amount of augmented
sediment would only increase Qs* to 0.13. This ratio is
small, because the magnitude of postdam floods has been
reduced approximately 60%. This amount of sediment is
nevertheless large in terms of engineering design. Randle et
al. [2007] estimated that augmentation of 4.3 	 106 Mg/a to
the Colorado River in Grand Canyon would cost between
$220 to $430 	 106 in project capital costs and between
$6.6 and $17 	 106/a in annual operating costs. In com-
parison, the 7-day release of a controlled flood from Glen
Canyon Dam in 1996 had an economic cost of $2.5 	 106,

7. Conclusions
[46] Metrics of the key environmental drivers of channel
change allow regional identification of factors controlling
channel change. The fundamental cause of channel change
is the imbalance between sediment supply and stream flow,
leading to conditions of postdam sediment deficit or sur-
plus. Under conditions of sediment deficit, channel incision
can occur, but only if the postdam regime is competent,
which we quantify with a Shields number. Long-term
changes in channel width and the rate at which the sediment
balance is reequilibrated may be related to the ratio of
postdam to predam flood discharge.
[47] Of more than 4000 km of regulated rivers evaluated
in this paper, more than 60% is in sediment deficit, thereby
causing degradation. The spatial distribution of deficit and
surplus reaches is primarily determined by the distance
between dams and downstream tributaries that significantly
alter the postdam flood and sediment supply regime. The
effort of rehabilitating deficit segments via sediment aug-
mentation may exceed those of rehabilitating surplus seg-
ments via reintroduction of floods.
[48] Our analysis is nevertheless incomplete and must be
augmented by a variety of other considerations before
making decisions about restoration priorities. Of primary
importance is the location of valued ecological or social
resources, which may substantially alter economic or polit-
ical assessment of our analysis. Other factors, such as the
location of highly valued resources, the extent of postdam
incision, the along-stream variation in water and sediment
supply and channel change, and the colonization of native
and nonnative riparian vegetation must be considered when
evaluating individual rivers and specific river management
opportunities. In some locations, details of the changed
physical structure of channels may of great ecological
consequence. Elsewhere, regulatory obligations or public
values may dictate an effort toward full restoration, despite
daunting constraints.
[49] A regional or national comparison of the magnitude
of disturbance downstream from dams on large rivers can
provide a rational basis for assessing and prioritizing the
outcomes, costs, and benefits of different river management
alternatives. The United States is a wealthy country with
many magnificent rivers worthy of focused environmental
management, but there are not sufficient funds, nor political
consensus, to fully restore every river. The scientific com-
munity is obligated to present a template for regional
prioritization and tradeoffs if limited resources are to be
expended wisely.
