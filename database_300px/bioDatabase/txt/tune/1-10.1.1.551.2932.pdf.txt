ABSTRACT
The crystal structure of the Tl+ form of the
G-quadruplex formed from the Oxytricha nova
telomere sequence, d(G4T4G4), has been solved to
1.55 A˚. This G-quadruplex contains five Tl+ ions,
three of which are interspersed between adjacent
G-quartet planes and one in each of the two thymine
loops. The structure displays a high degree of
similarity to the K+ crystal structure [Haider et al.
(2002), J. Mol. Biol., 320, 189–200], including the
number and location of the monovalent cation
binding sites. The highly isomorphic nature of the
two structures, which contain such a large number
of monovalent binding sites (relative to nucleic acid
content), verifies the ability of Tl+ to mimic K+ in
nucleic acids. Information from this report confirms
and extends the assignment of 205Tl resonances
from a previous report [Gill et al. (2005), J. Am.
Chem. Soc., 127, 16 723–16 732] where 205Tl NMR
was used to study monovalent cation binding to this
G-quadruplex. The assignment of these resonances
provides evidence for the occurrence of conforma-
tional dynamics in the thymine loop region that is in
slow exchange on the 205Tl timescale.
INTRODUCTION
G-quadruplexes are four-stranded structures formed from
DNA or RNA sequences containing tandem G-rich repeats.
Sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes in vitro have
been identified in the telomeres of various organisms (1–9)
where they are typically separated by short stretches of pyri-
midines. Their location within telomeric DNA sequences has
lead to the proposal that G-quadruplexes may be responsi-
ble for maintaining chromosomal integrity and chromatid
pairing during mitosis (10). G-quadruplexes have also been
the target of cancer research (11–14) because telomerase,
the ribonucleoprotein responsible for telomere maintenance,
is often found at elevated levels in cancerous cells (15,16).
Other sequences shown to form G-quadruplexes in vitro
have been identified in immunoglobulin switch regions (17)
and in several gene promoters (18,19); however the biological
relevance of these sequences has yet to be demonstrated
conclusively.
G-quadruplexes are characterized by consecutive stacks
of four planar, hydrogen-bonded guanine nucleotides, called
G-quartets (Figure 1). The number of G-quartets contained
within a single quadruplex varies, as does the number of dis-
tinct oligonucleotide strands that comprise the quadruplex. If
less than four separate strands are involved, they fold back
upon themselves leaving pyrimidine-rich unpaired loops.
There is a considerable amount of heterogeneity in the loca-
tion and conformation of these loops structures.
G-quadruplexes are stabilized by the binding of monoval-
ent cations, such as Na+, K+, NH4
+, Rb+ and Tl+ (2,5,20–32).
However, the number and location of these binding sites
appears to be cation specific. K+, NH4
+, Rb+ and Tl+ ions
bind between adjacent G-quartet planes (23,24,27,28,
30–32). Na+, presumably because of its smaller ionic radius,
has been reported to bind both between consecutive G-quartet
planes and within a single plane, although single plane
binding may be preferred (2,26,28,30,33). K+ has also been
observed bound to G-quadruplex loops (23), while NH4
+
reportedly does not bind to the loops of the same
G-quadruplex (31).
We recently reported the use of 205Tl NMR to directly
study the binding of 205Tl+ to the G-quadruplex formed from
the Oxytricha nova telomere sequence, d(G4T4G4)2 (34),
whose solution structure in the presence of Na+ was first
reported by Smith and Feigon (5). Tl+ is a K+ surrogate
with the advantage of being a spin-1/2 nucleus with a high
gyromagnetic ratio. Thus, its binding to biomacromolecules
can be directly observed by solution NMR. The 205Tl directly
detected NMR spectrum of d(G4T4G4)2 contained a cluster
of four downfield resonances (described as peaks 1–4,
Figure 2A) that correspond to 205Tl+ ions bound specifically
by the G-quadruplex, and an intense upfield peak resulting
from 205Tl+ free in solution (data not shown) (34). Peaks

2 and 3 were assigned to the outer and inner binding sites,
respectively, (Figure 2B) within the G-quadruplex channel
based on the identities of observed 1H–205Tl scalar couplings.
Only one peak was observed for the outer binding site because
a rotational symmetry operator bisects the region between the
centermost two G-quartet planes of d(G4T4G4)2.
1H–205Tl
scalar (J) couplings were not observed for two of the 205Tl
resonances, therefore their assignment in the G-quadruplex
structure could not be definitively ascertained.
Based on crystallographic studies of monovalent binding
to G-quadruplexes, the most likely assignment for the remain-
ing 205Tl peaks is in the thymine loops and/or along the
G-quadruplex grooves. The presence of K+ ions in the thym-
ine loops was predicted based on NMR studies of a related
G-quadruplex, d(G3CT4G3C)2 (35), and is consistent with
a crystal structure of the K+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 (23). How-
ever, solution studies of 15NH4
+-form indicated that only three
ammonium ions, all inside the G-quadruplex channel, are co-
ordinated by d(G4T4G4)2 (31). There are also examples of
monovalent cation binding, including Tl+, in both the major
(36,37) and minor (25,36,38–40) grooves of B-form DNA
duplexes. Thus, despite their importance for G-quadruplex
formation, the interaction of monovalent cations with these
structures remains somewhat ambiguous.
To gain a greater understanding of monovalent cation bind-
ing to nucleic acids, to further demonstrate the ability of Tl+
to specifically mimic K+, and to complete the assignment of
unknown 205Tl resonances, we have crystallized the Tl+-form
of d(G4T4G4)2 and determined the location of all Tl
+ binding
sites. When considered in light of this crystallographic data,
we propose that the unassigned peaks in the 205Tl NMR spec-
trum of d(G4T4G4)2 provide spectroscopic evidence for the
occurrence of conformational dynamics within the loop
region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crystallization conditions
DNA oligonucleotides d(GGGGTTTTGGGG) were pur-
chased (W. M. Keck Facility, Yale University) and desalted
using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters, USA) and eluted
with 40% (v/v) acetonitrile/water. After lyophilization, the
DNA was dissolved to a final concentration of 10 mM in H2O.
The crystallization conditions are listed in Table 1. The
crystallization buffer, 50 mM potassium cacodylate, was made
by adjusting the pH of cacodylic acid to 6.5 using potassium
hydroxide and then diluting the solution to the appropriate
concentration (50 mM). The final concentration of K+ in
the buffer was 85 mM.
G-quadruplex formation was facilitated by heating d(GGG-
GTTTTGGGG), potassium acetate, potassium cacodylate and
H2O to 358 K for 15 min followed by slow cooling to 277 K.
The DNA concentration during annealing was 2.14 mM.
After annealing, appropriate amounts of magnesium acetate,
spermine and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) were added
to the crystallization solution, making the final DNA concen-
tration 1.5 mM. The solution was then centrifuged at 14 000 g
for 30 min to remove any precipitate. Crystals were grown

using the hanging drop method (2 ml drops) at 291 K and
appeared after 6–8 weeks as clear, rod-like crystals. The
crystals were soaked in solutions containing 60% MPD and
50 mM thallium acetate for 2 h at 291 K prior to freezing
in liquid nitrogen.
Structure determination
Data were collected on beamline X25 at the National
Synchrotron Light Source at 0.9780 s wavelength and dif-
fraction was observed to 1.55 s. The data were integrated
and scaled using the HKL 2000 package (41). Experimental
phases were determined using molecular replacement with
the orthorhombic crystal structure determined by Neidle
and coworkers (23) (PDB 1JRN). The space group
(P212121) and unit cell dimensions were similar to the pub-
lished structure (Table 2). Refinement was performed using
Refmac5 (42–45) in the CCP4 program suite (46). Several
cycles of rigid body refinement were followed by restrained
refinement using TLS parameters, resulting in an R-factor
of 24.9%. One final round of restrained refinement was
performed using anisotropic B-factors, further reducing the
R-factor to 22.7%.
Thallium binding sites were determined after molecular
replacement based on the presence of large, unoccupied peaks
present in both the 2Fo  Fc and anomalous maps. The thal-
lium ions were assigned to regions containing strong density
in the anomalous map. Coot was used for water assignment
and viewing of all density maps (47). The PDB accession
code for the structure is 2HBN.
NMR CPMG-relaxation dispersion experiments
NMR experiments were performed on a 14.1 T Varian Inova
instrument equipped with a triple-resonance room temperat-
ure probe and xyz gradients at an experimental temperature
of 10C. The temperature was calibrated with 100% meth-
anol. Relaxation dispersion experiments (48) were performed
on the methyl groups of thymine using a 2.5 mM sample of
the G-quadruplex d(GGGGTTTTGGGG) containing 50 mM
thallium acetate. The NMR experiment was of the constant
relaxation time version (49) with the 1H and 13C carrier fre-
quencies placed at 1.5 and 14 p.p.m., respectively during the
relaxation period. CPMG delays were 0.625, 0.714, 1.0, 1.25
(· 2), 1.67 (· 2), 3.33, 2.5 (· 2), 5.0 and 10.0 ms. Peak intens-
ities were determined in NMRDraw (50) using the script
autoFit.tcl provided with the program. Dynamics parameters
were obtained by fitting dispersion equations to the experi-
mentally determined relaxation rates as described previously
(51). Methyl assignments at this lower temperature were
determined by monitoring the NMR chemical shifts in
a two-dimensional 13C HSQC in a temperature series from
25 to 10C.
RESULTS
Structure determination and features
The crystal structure of the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 was
solved to 1.55 s from a single crystal. We were able to obtain
crystals of the K+-form using conditions (Table 1) similar to
those reported by Neidle and coworkers (23) except that acet-
ate versions were substituted for all chloride-containing crys-
tallization components to avoid the formation of insoluble
thallium chloride in later steps. The concentrations of sper-
mine (3.5 mM) and DNA oligonucleotide (1.5 mM) were
slightly different from those used for crystallization of the
K+-form (4.10 and 1.0 mM, respectively). The K+-form was
then converted to the Tl+-form by soaking the crystals in
50 mM thallium acetate. Attempts were also made at crystal-
lizing the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 directly by substituting
various concentrations of thallium acetate for potassium acet-
ate in the crystallization solution. However, no crystals were
produced from these efforts.
Experimental phases were determined by molecular
replacement using the crystal structure of the K+-form
(PDB 1JRN) (23). Like the orthorhombic K+-form, the
Tl+-form was solved in the space group P212121 with unit cell
dimensions that differ from the K+-form by only 0.3–3.2%
in all dimensions (Table 2). Each asymmetric unit contains
two G-quadruplexes that have an RMSD of 0.24 s. The thym-
ine loops facilitate intermolecular packing within both the
asymmetric unit and crystal lattice by forming a pair of
pseudo 2-fold related hydrogen bonds between the T6 O4

from one G-quadruplex and the T8 N3 from the neighboring
G-quadruplex (Figure 3).
The thallium ions
The assignment of metal binding sites was facilitated by the
presence of strong anomalous peaks (>5.7s) (Figure 4). Each
G-quadruplex contains five bound Tl+ ions, three interdigit-
ated between G-quartet planes and one in each of the two
loops. The average spacing between each Tl+ ion is 3.6 s.
The relative positions of these five metals are very similar
to those found in the K+ crystal structure, where the average
metal–metal spacing is reported to be 3.4 s (23). The Tl+ ions
located between two successive G-quartet planes are coordin-
ated by eight oxygens (one O6 from each of the surround-
ing guanines). These coordination distances range from
2.5–3.3 s, which are similar to those observed in the K+
structure (2.6–3.1 s) (23). The Tl+ ions bound to the loops
are coordinated by four guanine O6 carbonyls from the
outer G-quartet plane and two thymine carbonyls (T5 and
T7 O2). The absence of any other regions of anomalous dens-
ity, including the absence of density in the region surrounding
the phosphate backbone, indicates that there are only five
ordered Tl+ binding sites (Figure 4).
The average B-factors for the loop-associated metals (39s2)
are higher than the other thallium binding sites (28 s2).
Smaller differences in B-factors are observed in the K+ crys-
tal structure (23 s2 in the loops versus 20 s2 in the channel)
(23). Additionally, the anomalous density in this region is
less spherical (Figure 4). Accordingly, an attempt was made
at refining the thallium ions located within the loops to par-
tial occupancy. Reducing the thallium occupancy by as little
as 10% produced lower B-factors and large positive peaks in
the Fo  Fc map. Accordingly, all thallium occupancies
were left at 100%. The high degree of thallium occupancy
can be explained by its ability to bind more tightly to mono-
valent binding sites than potassium in both proteins and nuc-
leic acids, including G-quadruplexes (24,52–56).
The G-quartets and grooves
Each G-quartet is formed by hydrogen bonding along the
Hoogsteen and Watson–Crick faces of the guanine (N2–N7
and N1–O6) with average bond lengths of 2.9 and 2.8 s,
respectively. The guanine bases have alternating syn–anti
glycosidic bond angles and all thymines are in the anti con-
formation. The position of G4 deviates slightly from the
G-quartet plane in each of the outer G-quartets. This displace-
ment allows G4 to stack with the subsequent thymine (T5).
The G-quartets in the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 each contain
one small, two medium and one large groove. Their average
widths (C50–C50) are 11.1, 14.4 and 17.2 s, which is nearly
identical to the K+ X-ray structure (23) and very similar to
other diagonally looped structures (2,5,20–22,34).
The waters
A total of 44 waters were assigned to each asymmetric unit.
The assignments were made in regions of unassigned density
(>1.0s) in the 2Fo  Fc maps that did not have any anomal-
ous density. The number of assigned waters is considerably
less than the number reported (230) for the crystal structure
of the K+-form (23). This is likely related to the use of differ-
ing criteria for the assignment of water peaks.
With respect to cation coordination, previous studies have
identified that two waters participating in the coordination of
the K+ ions bound within the thymine loops in the crystal
structure of d(G4T4G4)2 (23). Consistent with those studies,
in the structure reported here one of the assigned waters in
the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 is located within the thymine
loops and in close proximity to the loop-associated Tl+ ion.
The water–metal distance is 3.1 and 4.2 s for the two res-
pective G-quadruplexes located in the asymmetric unit. A
second region of density within the thymine loop region was
also initially assigned as water; however, this assignment
could not be confirmed in our structure because the density
is not resolved from the nearby Tl+ density. Accordingly,
this water assignment was deleted.

Comparison to other structures
The G-quadruplex is a homodimer containing diagonal thym-
ine loops at both ends (Figure 5A and B). This architecture is
identical to that observed in the solution structures (Na+, K+,
Tl+ and NH4
+) of d(G4T4G4)2 (5,20–22,34), in the crystal
structure of the Na+-form in the O.nova protein complex (2),
and in the orthorhombic and trigonal crystal structures of the
K+-form reported by Neidle and coworkers (23). The average
RMSD of the Tl+ and K+ crystal forms is 0.26s. The high degree
of similarity between these two crystal structures is a likely
explanation for the limited effect that soaks in high concentra-
tions of thallium (<50 mM) have on the structural resolution.
The RMSD of the Tl crystal structure to the solution struc-
ture of the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 (PDB 2AKG) is 2.16 s
(34); however, the G-quartets have an RMSD of only 1.25 s.
This suggests that the loop region is the source of the great-
est amount of variability between the X-ray and solution
structures (Figure 6A). In the crystal structure of the
Tl+-form, T8 is extended into solution, similar to the crystal
structures of the K+- (Figure 6B) and Na+-forms (2,23). This
is in contrast to the Tl+ (and K+) solution structures where
T8 stacks above the neighboring G-quartet plane. This con-
formation in solution is supported by unambiguous NOEs
between T8 and the G-quartet plane (G1, G4 and G12) (34).
The effects of crystal packing could explain the differences
observed in solution and crystal forms (Figures 3 and 6A).
However, the presence of telomere binding protein precludes
packing between G-quadruplexes in the crystal structure of
the Na+-form (2), indicating that monovalent metal identity
may also play a role in defining the loop conformation.
NMR dynamics
The relative 1H and 13C peak positions of the thymine methyl

assignment is straightforward at 10C (Figure 7A). The

DISCUSSION
Tl+ binding sites in d(G4T4G4)2
The crystal structure of the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 is very
similar to the K+ crystal structure (23), even in variable
regions, such as the thymine loops, and the monovalent cation
binding sites. These structural similarities and the ability of
such a large number of thallium ions to replace potassium
ions without disrupting the crystal lattice further verifies the
isomorphous nature of Tl+ and K+ in nucleic acids (34,57–60)
and suggests its usage as a heavy metal derivative in crys-
tallographic studies and as a monovalent ion probe
(24,25,34) is valid and non-perturbing.
The Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 is capable of binding three Tl
+
ions within the G-quadruplex channel and two in the thymine
loops. The observation of Tl+ ions associated in the thymine
loops is in agreement with the K+ crystal structure (23) but
not with solution studies of 15NH4
+ binding to d(G4T4G4)2
(20,31). Possible explanations that reconcile these data
are that the thymine loops of d(G4T4G4)2 do not adopt a
conformation in solution that can accommodate the binding

of any monovalent cations or that ammonium binds to
d(G4T4G4)2 in a manner that is somewhat different from K
+
and Tl+.
Thymine loop conformation
Because the loops mediate crystal packing and are the only
region that differs (albeit only slightly) from the solution
and crystal structures of both K+- and Tl+-forms, it is possible
that the crystal conformation does not exist in solution and
that the metal bound by the thymine loops is a crystallo-
graphic artifact. However, the involvement of this conforma-
tion in crystal packing does not rule out its existence in
solution. The thymine loops have increased transverse relaxa-
tion rates (34), indicating the presence of conformational
exchange in this region. Further evidence of their dynamic
nature is provided by the slightly elevated B-factors observed
in the loops relative to the G-quartets (Table 2). Accordingly,
it is reasonable to conclude that the loop conformation
observed in the crystal structure is one of several that exist
in solution.
Assignment of 205Tl NMR resonances
These combined crystallographic and NMR dynamics experi-
ments can be used to gain insight into the G-quadruplex struc-
ture and to refine the assignment of 205Tl resonances from the
recent NMR solution study of 205Tl+ binding to d(G4T4G4)2
(34). Based on these experiments, 205Tl peak 1 (Figure 2) is
likely binding in the thymine loops, given that ordered Tl+
binding sites exist in the loop regions of the crystal structure.
The high degree of occupancy in these binding sites is con-
sistent with the approximate area of peak 1 relative to
peaks 2 and 3.
The assignment of 205Tl peak 4, which is of lower intens-
ity, is less straightforward. No anomalous density was
observed along the G-quadruplex grooves, making it unlikely
that this is the explanation for the resonance corresponding
to peak 4. The monovalent binding sites located within the
G-quadruplex channel correspond to peaks 2 and 3 (34). Fur-
ther, each of these sites displayed 1H–205Tl scalar couplings,
which were not observed for peak 4. Thus, it is not likely that
peak 4 results from 205Tl+ binding to the G-quadruplex cha-
nnel. One remaining possibility is that peaks 1 and 4 corres-
pond to a single Tl+ ion bound to a conformationally mobile
thymine loop resulting in two, distinct 205Tl resonances sep-
arated by 40 p.p.m., which is reasonable considering the
extremely large 205Tl chemical shift range (7000 p.p.m.)
(61). This assignment to the thymine loop is in agreement
with the aforementioned data indicating that these loops are
in conformational exchange and could also be the reason
that 1H–205Tl scalar couplings were not observed for peaks
1 and 4.
However, the assignment of two 205Tl peaks to the loop
binding sites initially seems inconsistent with the symmetry
of this G-quadruplex (25,31,34). Because of this 2-fold sym-
metry, only one 1H resonance is observed for each proton in
the G-quartet and in the loop (5,20–22,34). In addition, only a
single 205Tl resonance is observed for the 205Tl+ ions bound
to the two outer G-quadruplex binding sites (34). Thus, the
Tl+ binding sites located in the thymine loops would be
expected to be magnetically equivalent as well, resulting in
only one 205Tl peak for the loop-associated binding sites.
This apparent discrepancy can be explained by taking note
of the more generous limit on slow conformational exchange
imposed by the large 205Tl chemical shift range. The appear-
ance of a resonance in an NMR spectrum for a nucleus in a
conformational exchange process depends on the relation
between the rate of exchange (kex) and the chemical shift dif-
ference (Dw) for the assumed, two exchanging conformations
(62). If the exchange rate is less than Dw (slow exchange) two
resonances are observed at the chemical shift values of the
individual conformations. If, on the other hand, kex > Dw
(fast exchange) a single resonance is observed at a population
weighted chemical shift. We propose that peaks 1 and 4
(Figure 2A) are in the slow exchange regime (two peaks)
on the thallium chemical shift timescale whereas the 1H
resonances in these conformational mobile loops are in the
fast exchange regime (one peak), thereby resolving the
noted discrepancy. This allows estimation of the time scale
for conformational motion of these loops. At 25C, the sep-
aration between the two downfield 205Tl resonances (peaks
1 and 4) is 40 p.p.m., Dw  72 000 s1 at 11.7 T, thereby
placing an upper limit on the exchange rate for a slowly
exchanging thallium ion. Even if a generous chemical
shift difference of 2 p.p.m. is considered for an exchanging
proton, Dw  6000 s1 at 11.7 T, which is 1/12 of the limit
on the 205Tl timescale. This places a lower limit on the
exchange rate on the 1H time scale. Thus, it is possible that a
conformationally exchanging thymine loop could be moving
on a timescale that would give rise to slow exchange on the
205Tl timescale and fast exchange on the 1H timescale if the
exchange rate was between 103–104 s1. In order to observe
two separate 1H resonances in an exchange process on this
time scale they would have to be separated by over
22 p.p.m., which is larger than the diamagnetic 1H chemical
shift range.
To obtain experimental evidence concerning the thymine
loop dynamics, NMR relaxation dispersion experiments
were performed (63). Because the thallium signal-to-noise
is insufficient to accurately measure conformational exchange
on this timescale, we attempted to characterize the loop
dynamics by using CPMG-dispersion experiments at the
methyl positions in the thymine loop residues. If these
loops are dynamic the methyl position should be sensitive
to its motion. The data in Figure 7B clearly show increasing
(dispersion) R2(1/tcp) values for T5 as the spin-echo delay
increases. The resulting dynamics parameters indicate an
exchange rate for T5 of 2900 s1 at 10C. If the exchange
rate at 25C is estimated by the so-called ‘Q10 ¼ 2’ rule
(64) kex would be 10 000 s1, a rate in line with the argu-
ment of a motional process in slow exchange with respect to
thallium but fast on the proton chemical shift time scale. It
should be noted that the exact exchange rate at 25C (the tem-
perature at which 205Tl NMR experiments were performed) is
not known. For technical reasons the CPMG-dispersion
experiment cannot determine exchange rates >104 therefore
they were performed at a lower temperature where the
exchange rate was estimated to be in the measurable range
based on our calculations and observations at 25C. This con-
clusion suggests that the areas of peaks 1+4 should equal
peak 2 (and 2 · peak 3). Quantitation of peak areas is difficult

due to the large linewidths, baseline distortions from the large
free Tl resonance, disordered Tl+ binding along the quadruplex
grooves, and the non-Lorentzian shape of peak 4. Nevertheless
considering all these factors, qualitative estimates provide
peak areas consistent with the exchange scenario described
above. In summary the dispersion experiments are completely
consistent with a flexible thymine loop resulting in a thallium
nucleus experiencing two distinct magnetic environments on a
time scale that allows observation of separate 205Tl resonances.
We have crystallized the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 and
demonstrated that it binds five Tl+ ions in a manner that is
nearly identical to the previously reported K+ crystal structure
(23). These results demonstrate that 205Tl+ ions bind within
the G-quadruplex thymine loops in a manner similar to K+
and are observable by direct detection 205Tl NMR (34). The
combination of knowledge from X-ray crystallography and
solution NMR of all existing Tl+ binding sites has led to
the proposal that multiple loop conformations exist, at least
two of which bind Tl+. The complementary nature of these
two spectroscopic techniques provides additional insight on
monovalent cation binding to the conformationally flexible
G-quadruplex.
