Modulation of the Cardiac Sodium Channel NaV1.5 by Fyn,
a Src Family Tyrosine Kinase
Christopher A. Ahern, Ji-Fang Zhang, Marilyn J. Wookalis, Richard Horn
Abstract—Dynamic modulation of ion channels can produce dramatic alterations of electrical excitability in cardiac
myocytes. This study addresses the effects of the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn on NaV1.5 cardiac sodium channels.
Sodium currents were acquired by whole cell recording on HEK-293 cells transiently expressing NaV1.5. Acute
treatment of cells with insulin caused a depolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation, an effect eliminated by the
Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. Sodium channels were coexpressed with either constitutively active (FynCA)
or catalytically inactive (FynKD) variants of Fyn. FynCA caused a 10-mV depolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation
compared with FynKD without altering the activation conductance-voltage relationship. Comparable effects of these Fyn
variants were obtained with whole-cell and perforated-patch recording. Tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipi-
tated NaV1.5 was increased in cells expressing FynCA compared with FynKD. We show that Fyn is present in rat cardiac
myocytes, and that NaV1.5 channels from these myocytes are tyrosine-phosphorylated. In HEK-293 cells the effect of
FynCA on NaV1.5 inactivation is abolished by the single point mutation Y1495F, a residue located within the cytoplasmic
linker between the third and fourth homologous domains of the sodium channel. We provide evidence that this linker
is a substrate for Fyn in vitro, and that Y1495 is a preferred phosphorylation site. These results suggest that cardiac
sodium channels are physiologically relevant targets of Src family tyrosine kinases. (Circ Res. 2005;96:991-998.)
Key Words: cardiac sodium channel  tyrosine kinase  Src  Fyn  phosphorylation
Voltage-gated sodium channels play a pivotal role incardiac excitability by controlling the upstroke of the
cardiac action potential. These ion channels display exquisite
sensitivity to changes in membrane potential and, as a
consequence, minor alterations in their biophysical properties
can have dramatic effects on cardiac function. Multiple
isoforms of sodium channels are expressed in the heart,
including the neuronal isoforms NaV1.1, 1.3, and 1.6, which
have been shown to reside within T-tubules and participate in
excitation-contraction coupling.1 However, in terms of con-
ducting the cardiac action potential, the tetrodotoxin-resistant
isoform, NaV1.5, is dominant in both its crude expression
level and its contribution to the myocytes’ sodium current.1
For this reason, identification of regulatory factors that
modify the behavior of NaV1.5 is crucial in understanding
cardiac excitability.
Both Src family and receptor tyrosine kinases are known to
be potent modulators of ion channels (see reviews2,3) More-
over, tyrosine kinase activity is enlisted in numerous signal
transduction pathways. For example, multiple ligands such as
insulin result in elevated tyrosine kinase activity in the
heart.4,5 Relatively little is known, however, about the mod-
ulation of voltage-gated sodium channels by tyrosine kinases.
In pheochromocytoma cells, acute application of receptor
tyrosine kinase agonists results in decreased sodium current,
caused by a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence
of steady-state inactivation.6 Moreover, sodium channels
from brain microsomes form a complex with the receptor
protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP), and activation of
RPTP shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation to
depolarized potentials.7 Although different mechanisms may
be at play, in each case, tyrosine phosphorylation of these
sodium channels is associated with a hyperpolarizing shift in
steady-state inactivation, resulting in fewer available chan-
nels for generating an action potential. Limited evidence
suggests that cardiac sodium currents behave oppositely from
their neuronal counterparts. Specifically, the application of
tyrosine kinase inhibitors to cardiac myocytes causes a
hyperpolarizing shift in the inactivation-voltage relationship,
suggesting that the phosphorylated form of the cardiac
channel displays enhanced excitability.8 We describe in this
study the effects of the Src family kinase Fyn on the cardiac
sodium channel NaV1.5, and Fyn’s potential target residue in
the channel’s cytoplasmic inactivation gate.

effect on the fast inactivation of the sodium currents (data not
shown). The pHOOK, pCS2 c-FynCA, and c-FynKD clones were gifts
from Dr T. Holmes and Alberto Llamas (New York University, New
York, NY).11 Calcium phosphate was used to transiently transfect
HEK-293 cells. For electrophysiology, cells cotransfected with
pHOOK (Invitrogen) were identified by their binding to pHOX
(4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one)– coated 2.0 to
2.5 m magnetic beads (Spherotech), which were synthesized using
previously described methods.12
Tissue Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and
Western Blots
HEK-293 cells were lysed 48 hours after transfection in ice-cold
lysis buffer containing (in mmol/L) 25 TRIS, 150 NaCl, 100 CsF,
100 NaF, 5 EDTA, 1 Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5),
supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and lysates
clarified by centrifugation. For antiphosphotyrosine assays, cells
were supplemented with 100 mol/L peroxide-treated Na3VO4 5
minutes before lysis. Minced adult rat hearts were homogenized
310 seconds at 10K with a Polytron homogenizer in lysis buffer
without Triton X-100 and centrifuged to remove nuclei, then
membranes pelleted by centrifugation at 50 000g. The membrane
pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100,
then clarified by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was
assayed for protein using the Bradford assay.
Transfected sodium channels were immunoprecipitated with
anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated pro-
tein from rat heart was immunoprecipitated with the 4G10 antibody
(Upstate) from 500 g lysate with protein G agarose (Sigma
Chemical). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-
PAGE and transferred to PDVF membranes (Millipore). Blots were
probed with antibodies against V5, Fyn (Transduction Laboratories),
or the nonconserved I-II loop of NaV1.5 (Chemicon), and detection
was by enhanced chemiluminescence.
The top panel of Figure 1A shows a representative V5 Western
blot of HEK-293 lysates from cells nontransfected (NT), expressing
NaV1.5 alone, or coexpressed with either FynCA (Constitutively
Active) or FynKD (Kinase Dead). NaV1.5 is robustly expressed in
HEK-293 cells and cotransfection with either Fyn mutant has no
effect on this expression. In the bottom panel of Figure 1 is a Fyn
Western blot of the indicated cell types showing that transfected
FynCA and FynKD are comparably expressed, ruling out differences in
expression levels of these exogenous kinases as a possible explana-
tion for their differing modulatory effects (see Results). It is worth
noting the expression of an endogenous Fyn, albeit at reduced levels,
in the nontransfected (NT) lane. The last lane of this panel demon-
strates the presence of Fyn in a rat cardiac myocyte preparation. We
next tested whether the engineered Fyn mutations had their expected
effects when expressed in HEK-293 cells. Figure 1B shows cell
lysates from HEK cells nontransfected or expressing either FynCA or
FynKD. Phosphotyrosine levels in these cell types were assayed by
4G10. NT cells have a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation that is
markedly increased with the expression of FynCA and mildly sup-
pressed by FynKD, consistent with the constitutively active and
dominant-negative effects predicted for these mutant kinases.
Fusion Proteins and Autoradiogram Procedures
The sodium channel III-IV loop amino acids Gly1481 to Asp1523 were
cloned into the pQE-30 Xa vector (Qiagen) resulting in a fusion
protein containing a N-terminal 6-histidine repeat followed by the
sequence: GSGSGSGIEGRPFNGTGSLGGQDIFMTEEQKKYYNA-
MKKLGSKKPQKPIPRPLNKFQGFIFDKLN. The Tyr-to-Phe mu-
tations at Y1494 and Y1495 were produced sequentially with
Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). All clones con-
tained an additional mutation at Y1517F. Fusion proteins (2 g),
isolated on Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen), were incubated with 5 ng
recombinant Fyn (Invitrogen) in a buffer containing (in mmol/L) 25
Tris-HCl, 30 MgCl2, 5 MnCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 0.05 Na3VO4, 0.5 DTT,
pH 7.2, and 2.5 Ci 32P-ATP. Reactions were incubated for 1 hour
at 30°C, separated on 16.5% Tris-Tricene gels (BioRad), transferred
to PVDF membranes and quantified with a phosphorimager.
Electrophysiology
In most experiments, standard whole-cell recording methods13 were
used to record ionic currents. The patch pipette contained
(in mmol/L) 105 CsF, 35 NaCl, 10 EGTA, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4).
The bath contained (in mmol/L) 150 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1
MgCl2, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4). Liquid junction potentials between
the bath and the pipette solution were corrected. Electrode resistance
was in the range of 1 to 1.5 M. Data were collected 10 to 15
minutes after the establishment of the whole cell configuration. In
one set of experiments (Figure 5), perforated patch recording was
used with the antibiotic amphotericin B, according to previously
described methods.14 The pipette solution contained (in mmol/L) 75
Cs2SO4, 35 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 8 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4) (junction
potential7.9 mV). The access resistance at the time of recording
ranged from 2.0 to 8.7 M. The voltage errors because of series
resistance in both standard whole cell and perforated patch record-
ings were always 3 mV after compensation. All experiments were
performed at room temperature.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using pCLAMP (Axon Instruments) and
ORIGIN 7.0 (OriginLab). Throughout the article, error bars repre-
sent the standard error of the mean. G-V relations were fitted to the

isoform in HEK-293 cells and assaying the expressed chan-
nels’ response to 1 g/mL insulin, a concentration 2-fold
higher than the effective dose in vascular endothelium.15 The
insulin receptor endogenous to HEK-293 cells is a receptor
tyrosine kinase that has been shown to activate Src family
tyrosine kinases.16 Bisindolylmaleimide (100 nmol/L) was
present in both pretreatment and bath solutions to ablate any
competing effects of conventional protein kinase C, whose
activation has been implicated in the insulin response path-
way of HEK-293 cells.17 The effects of insulin incubation on
expressed cardiac sodium channels were ascertained by
recording sodium currents in the whole-cell patch clamp
configuration.
Figure 2A shows the effects of insulin and of the specific
Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 on families of sodium
currents resulting from depolarizing steps from a holding
potential of 140 mV. Steady-state inactivation curves are
shown in Figure 2B. Insulin pretreatment caused a small but
significant depolarizing shift of the inactivation midpoint
(Vmid) from 95.02.4 to 89.21.9 mV for 7 control and
10 insulin-treated cells, respectively (P0.039). This result is
consistent with hyperpolarizing shifts caused by specific
inhibitors of Src family kinases on cardiac myocytes.8 It is
possible that this modulation is because of the tyrosine kinase
activity of the insulin receptor itself or one of its downstream
effectors. If the modulation is because of the activation of an
endogenous Src family tyrosine kinase, the effect should be
blocked by PP2. Consistent with this, 1 mol/L PP2 com-
pletely reversed the insulin-induced depolarizing shift back to
control levels, Vmid96.21.6 mV (n6), even though
insulin was present in pretreatment and bath solution
(P0.01 for PP2	insulin versus insulin alone; Figure 2A and
2B). Figure 2C displays the peak activation conductance-
voltage (G-V) relationships for the 3 classes of cell treat-
ments. In contrast to the modulation of sodium channel
inactivation properties, no evidence of either the insulin or
PP2 treatment was seen in the G-V curves. The rightward
shift of inactivation alone by insulin should produce an
enhanced window current, ie, an increased overlap of steady-
state activation and inactivation curves, which would result in
enhanced excitability in the region of the resting potential.
These results suggest that the NaV1.5 sodium channel is a
target of a Src family tyrosine kinase.
Modulation of NaV1.5 by Fyn Is Manifested in
Inactivation Properties
To test whether NaV1.5 can be modulated by a Src family
kinase, we coexpressed NaV1.5 in HEK-293 cells with either
of 2 mutants of the kinase Fyn. The constitutively active
mutant, FynCA, lacks its inhibitory carboxyl terminus,
whereas the “kinase-dead” mutant, FynKD, has a single point
mutation at K299M rendering it catalytically inactive.11
Figure 3A shows families of sodium currents from cells
expressing NaV1.5 alone or with either of the 2 Fyn mutants.
Consistent with our experiments with insulin, channel coex-
pression with FynCA causes an 11-mV depolarizing shift in the
steady-state inactivation curve (Figure 3B) from an average
Vmid of 100.42.0 mV for 9 FynKD cells to 89.40.9 mV
for 12 FynCA cells (P0.001). The steady-state inactivation
curve for NaV1.5 alone (9 cells) is shown as a line without
symbols for clarity. This line is a Boltzmann fit of the NaV1.5
data and is bounded on the right and left by the mutant
kinases, suggesting that a baseline tyrosine phosphorylation
of the channel exists when it is expressed alone in HEK-293
cells. This result also suggests that FynKD is capable of
displacing endogenous Fyn from binding sites in the vicinity
of its phosphorylation targets in the sodium channel. There
were no significant differences in the G-V relationships for
the 3 cell types shown (Figure 3C).
Although coexpression of FynCA clearly shifts the steady-
state inactivation curve, it has a smaller effect on the rate of
fast inactivation. Figure 3D shows that FynCA causes a slight
slowing of fast inactivation. This difference is statistically
insignificant (P0.05). Consistent with the depolarizing shift
of steady-state inactivation, however, the rate of recovery
from inactivation was increased in NaV1.5 channels coex-
pressed with FynCA (Figure 4). Moreover, channels in the
presence of FynCA had a decreased entry rate into a slow-in-
activated state (Figure 3E). Here, significance (P0.01) is
shown as an asterisk at the relevant time point. These results,
like those with insulin, provide evidence for modulation of
NaV1.5 by a tyrosine kinase.
Our whole-cell recordings use a pipette solution containing
105 mmol/L CsF. To test whether our conclusions might be
confounded by fluoride, a known inhibitor of serine-threonine
phosphatases, we examined the effects of these 2 Fyn variants
on NaV1.5 currents in the absence of fluoride using perforated
patch recording, a technique that causes less perturbation of
the intracellular milieu than whole-cell recording.14 Figure 5
shows that, in agreement with our standard whole-cell record-
ing, FynCA produces a 10-mV depolarizing shift of steady-

state inactivation without affecting the activation G-V
relationships.
Tyrosine kinase modulation of an ion channel may be
mediated either by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue or
by the allosteric consequences of the kinase binding to the
channel.18 In our case, the latter of these 2 possibilities is
unlikely, given that both of our kinase mutants contain
unperturbed SH3 binding domains and differ only in their
ability to phosphorylate tyrosine residues.11 Furthermore,
biophysical consequences of the expressed FynCA on sodium
channel inactivation were similar to those observed for an
acute insulin treatment, suggesting that these effects are
because of direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel
rather than alterations of the channel protein during biogen-
esis and trafficking.

affects the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the coex-
pressed sodium channel. The V5 Western blots show that
sodium channels were efficiently isolated in equal propor-
tions from both cell types. Antiphosphotyrosine blots of the
same samples demonstrate that the channels’ phospho-
tyrosine levels are markedly increased in cells coexpressing
FynCA compared with those coexpressing FynKD.
We have demonstrated that Fyn alters the biophysical
properties of NaV1.5 and that this modulation may involve the
phosphorylation of 1 or more tyrosine residues on the
channel. We next asked whether cardiac sodium channels are
tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo. To this end, we used a
commercially available antibody specific for NaV1.5 to iden-
tify these sodium channels in a rat cardiac membrane prepa-
ration. Lane 1 of Figure 6B shows a Western blot of this
membrane preparation and identifies the expected endoge-
nous sodium channel. To determine whether these sodium
channels were tyrosine phosphorylated, we immunoprecipi-
tated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from this cardiac prep-
aration with a phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10, and probed
with the NaV1.5 antibody. The results of this immunoprecipi-
tation are in the adjacent lanes in Figure 6B and demonstrate
that NaV1.5 is indeed tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo. These
biochemical results lead us to suggest that the modulation of
the inactivation properties of cardiac sodium channels is
because of direct phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the
channel.
Target Tyrosine Residue for Fyn Is in the
Cytosolic III-IV Loop
The NaV1.5 isoform contains 22 cytosolic tyrosines. Given
that FynCA modulates the inactivation properties of the chan-
nel, we narrowed our attention to tyrosine residues in the
cytoplasmic linker between domains III and IV, the putative
inactivation gate.19 Figure 7A shows a schematic rendering of
the NaV1.5 sodium channel highlighting the 4 homologous
domains and the cytosolic linkers that connect them. The
polypeptide sequence of the III-IV linker is partially ex-
panded and 2 potential target residues at positions 1494 and
1495 are shown in bold. Also shown in bold is the IFM (Ile,
Phe, Met) inactivation “ball” that is directly upstream from
these 2 tyrosines. The structure of this sequence has been
solved using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)20
and is shown in Figure 7B with the relevant residues marked
for clarity. Previous work from our laboratory showed that
the double Y1494Y1495/QQ mutation has pronounced effects on
the rates and voltage dependence of inactivation.9 To test the
importance of these twin residues in the modulatory effects

we observed, each was mutated individually to phenylala-
nine, and the single point-mutant sodium channels were
coexpressed with FynCA or FynKD. These single point muta-
tions themselves have little effect on channel function,
consistent with previous results.9
The effect of FynCA on the first mutant, Y1494F, is shown
in Figure 7C. Y1494F is indistinguishable from the wild-type
channel and responds to the kinase with a 12-mV rightward
shift in the steady-state inactivation (Vmid from 97.32.1 to
85.41.6 mV for 7 FynKD and 7 FynCA cells, respectively).
This result suggests that phosphorylation at tyrosine 1494 is
unlikely to mediate the effect of the tyrosine kinase. In
striking contrast, the effects of both FynCA and FynKD are
abolished in the channel carrying the Y1495F mutation
(Figure 7D). Y1495F channels had average Vmid values for
steady-state inactivation of 93.91.2 mV for 8 FynCA and
93.31.8 mV for 7 FynKD expressing cells, respectively,
both of which are indistinguishable from the Y1495F mutant
alone, Vmid92.11.2. As in the case with the wild-type
channel, Fyn modulation primarily affects the properties of
steady-state inactivation, leaving the activation G-V relation-
ships of both mutants unchanged (Figure 7C and 7D).
Although these data strongly suggest Y1495 to be the site of
phosphorylation, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in
actuality, both residues (as well as other tyrosine residues in
the channel) are phosphorylated yet only 1 site, Y1495,
governs the kinase effect on inactivation. In support of
multiple targets of Fyn, immunoprecipitation of either
Y1494F or Y1495F channels from cells coexpressing FynCA
had roughly equal phosphotyrosine levels (data not shown),
consistent with work showing multiple targets of Src family
kinases on other ion channels.21,22 Nonetheless, the ability of
the single Y1495F mutation to abolish Fyn modulation
strongly implicates this site in mediating the functional
effects of the kinase. This result can be rationalized by the
proximity of Y1495, but not Y1494, to M1487, a critical
residue involved in inactivation,23 as shown in the NMR
structure (Figure 7B) of this segment of the III-IV linker.20
Sodium Channel III-IV Loop Is a Substrate
for Fyn
To ascertain whether the Y1495 residue is a bona fide target
of Fyn, we generated a series of 6xHis-tagged fusion proteins
that contained the III-IV loop of NaV1.5 for use as in vitro
substrates for Fyn. We tested 4 fragments altogether: a
wild-type fragment, 2 single tyrosine to phenylalanine muta-
tions at the 1494 and 1495 positions, and a double mutant
with both 1494 and 1495 sites changed to phenylalanine.
Figure 8A shows a representative Coommassie blue–stained
gel containing these fragments. Each fragment shows the
same pattern with a prominent band at roughly the predicted
size of 8.5 kDa for the full-length fusion protein and 2 smaller
bands, both more weakly expressed. To verify the authentic-
ity of the fusion protein, we used an antibody directed against
the N-terminal 6xHis tag, which showed reactivity exclu-
sively with the highest molecular weight band (data not
shown). Before loading the fragments in the gel shown in
Figure 8A, each fragment was used as a substrate for
Fyn-catalyzed 32P incorporation. An autoradiogram of the
same gel from Figure 8A is shown in Figure 8B. The band at
55 kDa corresponds to the autophosphorylated form of the
kinase and demonstrates that there was robust and similar
levels of kinase activity for each reaction. The fusion protein
near the bottom of the gel gives a signal that is most intense
for the wild-type fragment and diminishes with each point
mutation. Using a phosphorimager, we measured the signal
from the 8.5 kDa band and quantified the results from 9 32P
incorporation experiments with the averages from this anal-
ysis shown in Figure 8C. The single Y1494F and Y1495F
mutants showed phosphorylation levels that were signifi-
cantly different (P0.001) from both wild-type and double-
mutant substrates. It is worth noting that their phosphoryla-
tion levels were significantly different from each other as
well (P0.01). Given that the signal of the Y1494F fusion
protein arises from phosphorylation at the Y1495 site, our
data suggest that Y1495 is the preferred phosphorylation
target for Fyn. Therefore, our results support the idea that the
cytoplasmic III-IV linker is a substrate for the Src family
tyrosine kinase Fyn and that Y1495 is preferred to its
neighboring tyrosine at position 1494.
Discussion
We show in this study that the voltage-gated cardiac sodium
channel NaV1.5 is modulated by the Src family tyrosine

kinase Fyn. The effect of the kinase on the channel is
manifested in altered steady-state inactivation. Fyn most
likely achieves this effect by increasing the rates of recovery
from fast inactivated states. We further provide evidence that
NaV1.5, either cotransfected with FynCA or isolated from
cardiac myocytes, is tyrosine phosphorylated. Lastly, the
biophysical effects of FynCA on NaV1.5 can be abolished with
a single point mutation, Y1495F, in the cytosolic linker
between domains III and IV.
Previous work on tyrosine kinase effects on voltage-gated
sodium channels showed that modulation takes the form of
altered inactivation.6–8 The modulation of the steady-state
inactivation of NaV1.5 by FynCA is in agreement with these
previous observations. However, although the modulation we
see is similar in magnitude, it is opposite in direction from
that observed for other channel isoforms. Specifically, when
neuronal sodium channel isoforms are modulated by tyrosine
phosphorylation, whether through growth factors6 or via an
association with protein tyrosine phosphatase ,7 the phos-
phorylated channel displays a more hyperpolarized steady-
state inactivation relationship. However, the depolarizing
shift we report in this study is what one would predict from
the response of isolated cardiac myocytes to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors.8 The apparent target tyrosine residue on the
cardiac channel, Y1495, is highly conserved among sodium
channels, suggesting that the phosphorylation of this residue
could stabilize or destabilize fast inactivated states of the
channel, depending on the sodium channel isoform. Alterna-
tively, other tyrosine residues, or other proteins associated
with sodium channels, may be responsible for these isoform
differences. The effect of tyrosine kinases on the neuronal
mutant homologous to Y1495F will prove useful in elucidat-
ing the mechanisms at play.
What is the physiological relevance of cardiac sodium
channel modulation by a Src family tyrosine kinase? First, we
note that NaV1.51 and Src24,25 are both concentrated at the
adherens junctions responsible for the electrical coupling
between cardiac myocytes. Thus, both are well placed to
influence action potential propagation through the myocardi-
um. Moreover, activation of Src family kinases reduces
junctional coupling, in part by phosphorylating connexins.25
An increase in excitability because of tyrosine phosphor-
ylation may play a compensatory role in physiological or
pathological situations in which cardiac excitability has been
compromised. Tyrosine kinase activity in the heart can be
elevated during decidedly nonpathological stimulation by
adrenergic ligands,4 angiotensin II,26 epidermal growth fac-
tor,27 or insulin.5 Tyrosine kinases may be activated also
through the pathological states associated with cardiac ische-
mia and reperfusion injury,28,29 and postinfarct left ventricular
remodeling.30 Furthermore, end-stage dilated cardiomyopa-
thy is accompanied by dramatic alterations in insulin signal-
ing31 and tyrosine phosphorylation.32 In both physiological
and pathological cases, tyrosine kinase activity is coupled to
other signaling pathways, including downstream and up-
stream kinases. Moreover, cardiac myocytes contain numer-
ous other isoforms of ion channels subject to modulation by
kinases and phosphatases, resulting in an inherently complex
system. We give evidence here that Src family tyrosine
kinases provide the heart with a potent tool for fine tuning
cardiac electrical excitability, demonstrating yet another
adaptive pathway for regulation of heart function.
