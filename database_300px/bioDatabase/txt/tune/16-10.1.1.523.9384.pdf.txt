Abstract
Hypoxia plays a key role in tumor cell survival, invasion, and
metastasis. Here we show that hypoxia increases tumor cell
invasion by the modulation of Rab11, an important molecule
for vesicular trafficking, especially membrane protein recy-
cling and translocation of proteins from trans-Golgi network
to plasma membrane. Dominant-negative Rab11 dramatically
decreased hypoxia-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast
carcinoma cells without affecting cell apoptosis. Hypoxia-
induced Rab11 trafficking is regulated by microtubule
stability, as evidenced by the findings that hypoxia increases
Glu tubulin and that colchicine blocks Rab11 trafficking and
invasion. Inhibition of GSK-3B activity by hypoxia seems to be
central to microtubule stabilization and invasion. In fact,
expression of a dominant-negative GSK-3B was sufficient to
stimulate invasion in normoxia. One target of Rab11-mediated
trafficking that contributes to invasion is the integrin A6B4.
Hypoxia induced a significant increase in A6B4 surface
expression but it had no effect on the surface expression of
A3B1. This increase is dependent on Rab11 and stable
microtubules. In summary, we identify vesicle trafficking as
a novel target of hypoxic stimulation that is important for
tumor invasion. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(7): 2761-9)
Introduction
Breast epithelial cells, similar to other epithelia, are able to
survive and differentiate because of the tissue architecture and
growth factor milieu present in the mammary gland (1–3). This
rich environment, however, is progressively lost during malignant
transformation, especially as malignant cells become invasive
and metastatic. Such cells must acquire mechanisms that
maintain their survival and promote their invasion outside the
confines of the mammary gland. As argued recently, cancer
progression is an evolutionary process that selects for cells that
exhibit the capacity for survival, among other properties (4, 5).
Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, tumor cells must
survive in environmental conditions not present in normal
tissue. One of the most formidable barriers to their survival is
hypoxia (6). The oxygen tension within many solid tumors is
substantially less than that in adjacent normal tissue, presum-
ably because of poor vascularization (6). Although hypoxia will
kill most normal cells and some tumor cells, it also provides a
strong selective pressure for the survival of the most aggressive
and metastatic cells. In fact, clinical studies have clearly shown
that the low pO2 tension within a neoplastic lesion is an
independent prognostic indicator of poor outcome and corre-
lates with an increased risk to develop distant metastasis
independently of therapeutic treatment (6–8).
An important property of tumor cells that are able to survive in
hypoxia is that they exhibit an enhanced propensity to invade (9), a
finding that underscores the hypothesis that hypoxia facilitates
tumor progression. An understanding of the mechanisms by which
hypoxia stimulates invasion would provide insight into the nature
of invasion itself. Indeed, such studies to date have substantiated
the importance of growth factor receptors such as Met and
protease receptors such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator
receptor in invasion (10, 11). These and other studies have
highlighted the ability of hypoxia to increase the expression of
these proteins at the level of transcription (12, 13). This conclusion
is consistent with the well-documented influence of hypoxia on
gene activation (14, 15). Surprisingly, however, other potential
mechanisms by which hypoxia may facilitate invasion have not
been considered.
In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that hypoxia affects
the trafficking of specific proteins, which are involved in the
invasive process, to the cell surface. This novel hypothesis is rooted
in the emerging view that cell migration may involve the recycling
of adhesion receptors and other components of the migratory
apparatus (16). To this end, we focused our efforts on the Rab
family of small G proteins, which consist of more than 30 members
that regulate intracellular vesicle trafficking. Among the various
Rabs, Rab11 is of potential relevance because it is a key regulator of
the dynamics of recycling endosomes (17, 18) and it has been
implicated in the plasma membrane recycling of several proteins
that could be important for invasion including h1 integrins and the
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (19, 20). Rab11 is also
involved in transport of molecules from recycling endosomes to
trans-Golgi network and from trans-Golgi network to plasma
membrane (17, 21, 22). The data we report here implicate a key role
for Rab11 in the hypoxia-stimulated invasion of breast carcinoma
cells. Moreover, we elucidate a mechanism for this phenomenon
that involves the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK-
3h) activity by hypoxia and a consequent increase in microtubule
stability, and the microtubule-dependent trafficking of Rab11-
containing vesicles. Importantly, we also identified one surface
receptor critical for invasion that is a target of this pathway, the
a6h4 integrin.

(FACS) analysis was prepared in our lab (23). A detyrosinated a-tubulin
antibody was purchased from Synaptic Systems and a Rab11 antibody was
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). Colchicine was
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Transfections. Wild-type Rab11 (pEGFP-Rab11-WT) and GDP-locked
Rab11 (pEGFP-Rab11-S25N) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Robert
Lodge. A kinase-inactive GSK-3h construct was a gift from Dr. James R.
Woodgett. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer.
Hypoxia experiments. For experiments that involved hypoxic culture
conditions, cells were grown in low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 100
units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum. At the initiation of these experiments, the cells were
washed twice with PBS and serum-free medium was added. After 6 hours,
cells were incubated in either a normoxic environment (standard tissue
culture incubator) or in a hypoxic chamber maintained at 3% O2.
Apoptosis assays. Immediately following incubation in either normoxia
or hypoxia, cells were washed once with serum-containing medium, once
with PBS, once with annexin V-FITC buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH (pH
7.4) 140 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2], and then incubated for 15
minutes at room temperature with 5 Ag/mL annexin V-FITC (Biosource
International, Camarillo, CA). After washing once with annexin V buffer, the
samples were resuspended in the same buffer. Immediately before analysis,
5 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Biosource International) was added to
distinguish apoptotic cells from necrotic cells and the cells were analyzed
using a flow cytometer. For the detection of apoptosis of GFP-transfected
cells, the same methods were employed except that annexin V-phycoery-
thrin without propidium iodide was used.
Analysis of protein expression. Subsequent to incubation in normoxia
or hypoxia, cells were analyzed for their expression of specific proteins by
either FACS or immunoblotting. For FACS analysis, cells were washed twice
with ice-cold PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Aliquots of
cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4jC with antibodies in the PBS/BSA
solution. The cells were washed thrice with PBS/BSA and then incubated
with secondary antibodies coupled to R-phycoerythrin for 1 hour at 4jC.
After washing thrice with PBS/BSA, the cells were resuspended in PBS and
analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
For immunoblot analysis, the cells were extracted in radioimmunopre-
cipitation assay buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.0% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholic
acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0)]. For integrin a6, samples were
resuspended in a nonreducing sample buffer [5!: 60 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue] and for Rab11,
samples were resuspened in reducing buffer [5!: 60 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1%
bromophenol blue]. These were boiled for 5 minutes and electrophoresed
by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to Hybond-enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Blots were
blocked with TBST buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20] containing 5% nonfat dried milk and probed with
primary antibodies overnight and secondary antibodies coupled to
peroxidase for 1 hour. Blots were developed using the enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).
Analysis of RNA expression. Total cellular RNA was purified from
cultured cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the
protocol of the manufacturer. For reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis, a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) was used.
Invasion assays. The upper chambers of Transwells (Corning Costar)
were coated with 0.5 Ag of Matrigel (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA)
that had been diluted with cold water and allowed to air dry. Subsequently,
the coated Transwell membranes were incubated with DMEM for 1 hour
and 5 ! 104 cells were plated in the upper chambers. The lower chambers
contained 5% NIH-3T3 conditioned medium. The inserts were incubated for
24 hours at 37jC in either a normoxic or hypoxic environment. The cells
that had invaded the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with
methanol and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 2% ethanol. The number of
cells that had invaded was quantified by counting random fields using a
light microscope equipped with a reticle.
Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were plated at low
density and incubated overnight at atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37jC in
either normoxia or hypoxia. Subsequently, the cells were fixed immediately
with a buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 100 mmol/L KCl, 200 mmol/
L sucrose, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsul-
fonyl fluoride, and 10 mmol/L PIPES at pH 6.8 for 15 minutes, and then
treated with a buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 mmol/L KCl, 200
mmol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 10.8 mmol/L
PIPES at pH 6.8 for 2 minutes. The cells were rinsed with PBS thrice and
incubated with a blocking solution containing 3% BSA and 5% serum in PBS
for 15 minutes. The cells were then incubated with specific antibodies for 90
minutes. The cells were rinsed thrice and incubated with a secondary
antibody conjugated to fluorescein (minimal cross-reaction interspecies;
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in blocking buffer
for 1 hour. Cells were rinsed with PBS thrice and mounted with a mounting
buffer [1% propylgallate in a mixture of glycerol and PBS (8:2)] and
examined using a confocal microscope.
Results
Rab11 is involved in hypoxia-stimulated invasion. Invasive
and metastatic carcinoma cells have the propensity to survive
autonomously in stressful microenvironments such as hypoxia (14).
Indeed, MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells exhibit no significant
increase in apoptosis as determined by annexin V-FITC staining
when exposed to hypoxia (3% O2) for 24 hours in the absence of
serum (Fig. 1A). Such conditions, however, stimulate the relative
rate of invasion of these cells f2.5-fold in comparison with cells
maintained in normoxia (Fig. 1B). To assess the hypothesis that
Rab11 is involved in hypoxia-stimulated invasion, cells were
transfected with either a GFP control vector (pEGFP) or a GDP-
bound inactive Rab11 vector (pEGFP-Rab11-S25N). The trans-
fection efficiency for both vectors wasf50% to 55% as determined
by GFP expression. Cells that expressed the control vector
exhibited increased invasion in hypoxia that mimicked the data
shown in Fig. 1B (Fig. 1C). Expression of the inactive Rab11 vector,
however, resulted in a drastic decrease in invasion in hypoxia
(Fig. 1C). The relatively low level of invasion in normoxia was also
inhibited by expression of inactive Rab11 but the degree of
inhibition was substantially less than that observed in hypoxia
(Fig. 1C). Of note, expression of the inactive Rab11 vector had no
effect on cell viability or apoptosis (data not shown). These data
argue for the involvement of Rab11 in invasion, an involvement
that is amplified in hypoxia.
The data shown in Fig. 1 suggest that hypoxia alters either the
expression or function of Rab11. To evaluate these possibilities, we
examined the effect of hypoxia on the expression of Rab11 mRNA
by RT-PCR and protein by immunoblotting. The data obtained
indicate that hypoxia does not influence Rab11 expression either at
24 hours, the time period for the invasion assays, or longer time
periods (48 hours; Fig. 2A). Given that Rab11 is involved in protein
recycling and transport to the plasma membrane, we assessed the
effect of hypoxia on the localization of Rab11 by expressing a GFP-
tagged wild-type Rab11 vector in MDA-MB-231 cells. In cells
maintained in normoxia, Rab11 concentrates in vesicles in the
perinuclear region and it seems that relatively little Rab11 is
present near the plasma membrane or dispersed throughout the
cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). Hypoxic exposure for 24 hours, however,
caused Rab11-containing vesicles to disperse throughout the
cytoplasm and proximal to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). These
findings are consistent with the notion that hypoxia stimulates the
ability of Rab11 to mediate the transport of vesicles to the plasma
membrane.

Hypoxia stabilizes microtubules. Based on the reports that
Rab11 trafficking is regulated by microtubules (24–26) and that
microtubules are involved in vesicle trafficking (27), we
examined the hypothesis that hypoxia alters Rab11 localization
by altering or stabilizing microtubules. For this purpose, MDA-
MB-231 cells were transfected with a GFP-wild-type Rab11
vector, maintained in either normoxia or hypoxia for 24 hours,
and then stained with a tubulin antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A ,
cells maintained in normoxia exhibited a relatively sparse and
disorganized pattern of microtubules and perinuclear localization
of Rab11. Cells maintained in hypoxia, however, displayed an
extensive network of microtubules that were thicker and more
aligned than those observed in normoxia and a dispersed
localization of Rab11. Of note, Rab11-containing vesicles were
seen adjacent to the elongated microtubules (Fig. 3A). The
dependence of Rab11 localization on microtubule structure is
evidenced by the finding that disruption of microtubules using
colchicine in cells maintained in hypoxia resulted in the
aggregation of Rab11-containing vesicles in the perinuclear
region (Fig. 3B).
More definitive evidence to support the hypothesis that hypoxia
stabilizes microtubules was obtained using an antibody that
recognizes detyrosinated (Glu) tubulin, an indicator of microtubule
stability (28–30). As seen in Fig. 3C , little, if any, Glu tubulin
staining was detected in cells maintained in normoxia. In contrast,
Glu tubulin staining was clearly evident in cells maintained in
hypoxia (Fig. 3C). Finally, to validate the importance of micro-
tubules for invasion, invasion assays were done in the presence of
colchicine (Fig. 3D). This microtubule disrupting agent decreased
invasion dramatically (Fig. 3D) but it did not have a significant
effect on the apoptosis of these cells (Fig. 3D).
Hypoxia stabilizes microtubules by a mechanism that
involves activation of Akt and inhibition of glycogen synthase
kinase 3B. Microtubule stability is regulated by GSK-3h, the
activity of which is inhibited by Akt. These findings lead to the
hypothesis that one mechanism by which hypoxia stabilizes
microtubules is to stimulate Akt activation and inhibit GSK-3h.
This hypothesis was evaluated by assessing the effect of hypoxia on
the activities of these kinases. As shown in Fig. 4A , hypoxia
increased the phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 as determined
by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody. This
increased phosphorylation was evident at 24 hours of hypoxic
exposure and was sustained for an additional 24 hours. A similar
induction of GSK-3h phosphorylation was observed, an event that
triggers the inactivation of this kinase.

cells. A, apoptosis in normoxic or hypoxic culture conditions was assessed
using annexin V-FITC as described in Materials and Methods. B, the ability
of cells to invade Matrigel during 24 hours of incubation in either normoxia or

determined as described in B .Columns, mean of three independent experiments;

To evaluate the contribution of Akt and GSK-3h to hypoxia-
induced microtubule stabilization, we used LY294002 to inhibit
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is upstream of Akt, and the
GSK-3h inhibitor, SB415286. Treatment of cells maintained in
hypoxia with LY294002 resulted in a dramatic disruption of
microtubules (Fig. 4B). Conversely, SB415286 treatment of cells
maintained in normoxia resulted in increased microtubule
organization (Fig. 4B). Additional evidence to support the involve-
ment of GSK-3h in hypoxia-induced stabilization of microtubules
was obtained using the Glu tubulin antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C ,
the induction of Glu tubulin expression at 24 hours of exposure to
hypoxia parallels the increase in phospho-Akt expression. Moreover,
inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with LY294002 pre-
vented the induction of Glu tubulin expression and, conversely,
inhibition of GSK-3h with SB415286 increased Glu tubulin
expression substantially (Fig. 4C ). These data support the
hypothesis that the inhibition of GSK-3h activity in cells maintained
in normoxia would increase their rate of invasion. Indeed, as shown
in Fig. 4D , expression of a kinase-dead GSK-3h resulted in an f2-
fold increase in the relative rate of invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.
Hypoxia increases surface expression of integrin A6B4
through a Rab11-dependent pathway. The foregoing data argue
for a mechanism of hypoxia-stimulated invasion that involves
inhibition of GSK-3h activity, increased microtubule stability, and
microtubule-dependent trafficking of Rab11-containing vesicles. A
key question that emerges from this mechanism is the
identification of surface proteins of which expression is regulated
by Rab11 and that function in invasion. In this regard, we focused
on specific integrins as potential targets of Rab11 trafficking for
several reasons. Integrins mediate the invasion of cells through
basement membranes and there is evidence that trafficking of h1
integrins can be regulated by Rab11 (19). We chose to study the
two integrins that are the primary receptors for basement
membranes on epithelial and carcinoma cells: a3h1 and a6h4.
Both of these integrins are expressed on MDA-MB-231 cells, and,
with respect to the a6 integrins, these cells express mostly a6h4
and little, if any, a6h1 (31, 32). Initially, we assessed whether
hypoxia increased the surface expression of these integrins using
flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5A , hypoxia increased the
surface expression of the a6 and h4 subunits significantly, but it

microtubules. A, cells were transfected with wild-type
Rab11 (pEGFP-Rab11-WT) for 12 hours and then

did not have a significant effect on the expression of the a3
subunit. Moreover, the time course for the hypoxia-induced
increase in a6 expression (Fig. 5B) mirrored the invasion and
biochemical data shown previously.
The potential regulation of a6 integrin surface expression by
Rab11 was investigated using the inactive, GDP-bound form of
Rab11. Expression of this construct in MDA-MB-231 cells
prevented the hypoxia-induced increase in a6 surface expression
(Fig. 5C). Importantly, expression of this construct had no
significant effect on the surface expression of the a3h1 integrin
(Fig. 5D), a finding that indicates that a3h1 surface expression is
not regulated by Rab11 in these cells. To exclude the possibility
that hypoxia increases total expression of the a6 integrin, we
examined a6 mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 5E) and protein expression by
immunoblotting (Fig. 5F) in cells maintained either in normoxia or
hypoxia. No differences in expression were evident under these
conditions.
Additional insight into the relationship between a6 integrins and
Rab11 was obtained by immunostaining cells maintained in
normoxia or hypoxia. In normoxia, a6 and Rab11 exhibited an
intense colocalization in vesicles in the perinuclear region (Fig. 6).
Hypoxia resulted in a striking redistribution of a6 to the plasma
membrane and a dispersal of Rab11 containing vesicles throughout
the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). In addition, some of these cytoplasmic
vesicles exhibited a6 staining. These staining patterns are
consistent with a model in which hypoxia stimulates the Rab11-
dependent transport of a6-containing vesicles to the plasma
membrane. In contrast, there was no indication of a colocalization
of Rab11 with a3 integrin either in normoxia or hypoxia, and
hypoxia had no effect on the plasma membrane localization of a3
(Fig. 6). These immunostaining data substantiate the flow
cytometry data shown in Fig. 5.
Discussion
The hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors selects for the
survival of aggressive, highly invasive cells that have the propensity
to metastasize (8). Although the mechanisms used by tumor cells

to survive in hypoxia are known in reasonable detail, less is known
about how hypoxia facilitates the migration and invasion of such
cells. In this direction, the data reported here reveal that
microtubule stabilization and the consequent effects of this
stabilization on Rab11-mediated vesicle transport are novel targets
of hypoxic stimulation that are linked to invasion. Moreover, we
identified one target of Rab11-mediated vesicle transport, the
integrin a6h4, of which surface expression is regulated by hypoxia
and that functions to mediate invasion.
Previous studies on the mechanism by which hypoxia stimulates
tumor invasion have focused largely on the ability of hypoxia-
inducible factor 1 to stimulate the transcription of proteases and
protease receptors that have potential to facilitate invasion (33, 34).
In addition, a recent study highlighted the ability of hypoxia to
enhance the transcription of the Met receptor and promote
hepatocyte growth factor–dependent invasion in hypoxic areas of
tumors (12). To our knowledge, ours is the first study that identifies
Rab GTPase-mediated vesicle transport as a target of hypoxic
stimulation. In simple terms, these findings imply that the tumor
microenvironment can alter the transport and recycling of cell
surface proteins, a process that would provide a dynamic link
between the microenvironment and invasion. Although the
established function of Rab11, the Rab GTPase that we have
implicated in invasion, is recycling of plasma membrane proteins
(17, 18), it is also involved in transport of molecules from recycling
endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (21) and from the trans-
Golgi network to plasma membrane (17, 21, 22). In this context, it
has been shown recently that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase h, one
of the isoforms of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, interacts with
GTP-bound Rab11 to regulate vesicular transport from the Golgi
complex to the plasma membrane (35). This role of Rab11 in
transport from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane is
substantiated by our finding that hypoxia facilitated the transport
of vesicles containing the a6 integrin from the perinuclear region
to the plasma membrane. Thus, it seems likely that hypoxia
increases recycling, as well as translocation of newly synthesized
and endocytosed vesicles, from the Golgi complex to the plasma
membrane.
Although microtubules have been implicated in Rab11 vesicle
transport (24–26), the ability of hypoxia to stabilize microtubules
had not been considered. This result, however, is consistent with
numerous studies that have implicated microtubules in cell

migration (36-39). Reorganization of the microtubule network and
regulation of its dynamics are essential for cell polarization toward
the direction of movement. More specifically, the formation of a
subset of unusually stablemicrotubules by cappingmicrotubule plus
ends contributes to this polarization (29, 40, 41). Stable microtubules
increase cell migration because they serve as tracks for directed
membrane and organelle transport to the leading edge of the cell and
they regulate adhesion and contraction. These stable microtubules
have a long half-life (>1 hour) compared with dynamic microtubules
with a half-life of 5 to 10 minutes (42). Detyrosinated tubulin (Glu
tubulin) is a form of stabilized tubulin that accumulates in the
microtubules of migrating cells (28–30). Our finding that hypoxia
increases the content of Glu tubulin in carcinoma is consistent with
a role for stabilized tubulin in hypoxia-induced migration and
invasion. Interestingly, these data also agree with the observation
that tubulin detyrosination occurs in breast cancers with poor
prognosis (30).
The finding that hypoxia inhibits the activity of GSK-3h is
intriguing in light of the potential contribution of this kinase to
tumor invasion. GSK-3h is a key regulator of numerous signaling
pathways including G-protein coupled receptors and cellular
response to Wnt signaling (43). Of relevance to our study are the
reports that GSK-3h phosphorylates a number of microtubule-
associated proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein
(MAP2C), MAP1B, tau, adenomatous polyposis coli, and cytoplas-
mic linker protein–associating protein 2 (44–48). The fact that
their phosphorylation by GSK-3h decreases their ability to stabilize
microtubules provides a mechanism that links hypoxia-mediated
inactivation of GSK-3h to microtubule stabilization. Indeed, our
data indicate that active GSK-3h impedes the invasion of
carcinoma cells. This conclusion is consistent with the recent
reports that inhibition of GSK-3h induces the transcription and
stabilization of Snail, a transcription factor that represses
E-cadherin transcription and, as a consequence, promotes an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (49, 50). Moreover, it is well
established that loss of E-cadherin expression is associated with
more invasive and aggressive tumors and that the epithelial-
to-mesenchymal transition is a useful paradigm for studying
tumor invasion (51). Based on our results, it will be informative to
test the hypothesis that microtubule stabilization is a critical
component of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
The fact that the a6h4 integrin seems to be a target of Rab11-
mediated trafficking adds to the numerous reports that have
implicated this integrin in the migration and invasion of carcinoma
cells (1, 52, 53). Interestingly, the a3h1 integrin, which has also
been implicated in epithelial and carcinoma cell migration, does
not seem to be subject to regulation at the level of trafficking by
hypoxia. These observations agree with an earlier study that had
shown that a6h4 but not a3h1 participates in endocytotic
recycling (54). In addition, it was argued in this study that the
determinants of integrin recycling are integrin a chains and not h
chains. This point is substantiated by the finding that the
cytoplasmic domain of the a6 subunit is responsible for the
trafficking of the a6h4 and a6h1 integrins (55). A more recent
study provided evidence that integrin h1 is transported through a
Rab11-positive recycling compartment (19). Taken together, it will
be informative to determine which specific h1 integrins are subject
to Rab11 trafficking and whether such trafficking is regulated by
hypoxia. Nonetheless, our finding that a6h4 is regulated by Rab11
and that this regulation facilitates invasion reinforces a central role
for this integrin in carcinoma progression.
Although our study highlights a6h4 as one target of Rab11-
mediated trafficking that facilitates invasion, it is more than likely
Figure 6. Rab11 regulates trafficking of integrin a6. Cells were
transfected with wild-type Rab11 (pEGFP-Rab11-WT) for 12 hours
and then incubated in either normoxia or hypoxia for 24 hours. The
localization of the integrin a6 and a3 subunits was detected by
indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described in Materials
and Methods. Bar, 20 Am.

that several other proteins are also targets. Of interest for further
study in this direction are invasion-related proteins such as EGF
receptor, protein kinase C-a, and CXC chemokine receptors, all of
which can be regulated by Rab11 (20, 56-58). Moreover, given that
EGF receptor signaling and protein kinase C-a have been shown to
promote the invasive function of a6h4 (59-63), it is tempting to
speculate that hypoxia may enhance a synergism among these
proteins, which facilitates invasion.
