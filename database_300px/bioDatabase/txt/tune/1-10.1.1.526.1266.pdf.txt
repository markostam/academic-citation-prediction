[1] The relevance of groundwater as an important source of root zone moisture by
means of capillary rise is increasingly being recognized. This is partly reflected in many
current land surface schemes, which increasingly replace a one-way (i.e., downward)
drainage of water by a two-way interaction flux between the root zone and a groundwater
system. A fully physically correct implementation of this two-way saturated-unsaturated
interaction flux requires transient simulations using the highly nonlinear Richards’
equation, which is a computationally demanding approach. We test a classic simple
approximation that computes the root zone–groundwater interaction flux as the net effect
of a downward drainage flux and an upward capillary rise flux against the Darcy
equation for quasi steady state conditions. We find that for a wet root zone and/or
shallow groundwater, the errors within this approximation are significant and of the same
magnitude as the interaction flux itself. We present a new closed-form parameterization
of the Darcy equation–based fluxes that accounts both for root zone soil moisture and
depth to the water table. Parameter values for this parameterization are listed for 11
different, widely applied soil texture descriptions. The high numerical efficiency of the
proposed method makes it suitable for inclusion into demanding applications, e.g., a
Monte Carlo framework, or high spatial resolution.

1. Introduction
[2] An accurate description of the water and energy
budgets at the land surface depends on a correct represen-
tation of soil moisture availability for evapotranspiration.
The presence of groundwater can affect the soil moisture
budget in the root zone [Beldring et al., 1999], as well as
vegetation and evapotranspiration, especially in (riparian
zones within) semiarid areas [Cooper et al., 2006; Newman
et al., 2006; Ridolfi et al., 2006]. However the modeling of
the fluxes between the groundwater and the root zone, and
the accurate modeling of groundwater dynamics in relation
to both vertical and horizontal redistribution of water in the
landscape, is complicated because of the high nonlinearities
involved. The potential impact of groundwater on evapo-
transpiration and climate is now widely recognized [e.g.,
Bierkens and van den Hurk, 2007], and groundwater
modules are currently being implemented in existing land
surface models [e.g., Koster et al., 2000; Liang et al., 2003;
Maxwell and Miller, 2005; Yeh and Eltahir, 2005; Fan et
al., 2007; Gulden et al., 2007; Miguez-Macho et al., 2007;
Niu et al., 2007]. It is important that these modules have a
realistic and consistent representation of the saturated-unsat-
urated zone coupling.
[3] Different types of land surface models can be distin-
guished on the basis of their treatment of groundwater. A
possible classification is the following.
[4] Type 1 is root zone controlled and assumes no or very
deep groundwater. This is the ‘‘classical’’ land surface
model where flow from the root zone downward is driven
by gravity and is only a function of the soil moisture content
in the lower part of the root zone. Capillary effects are
ignored.
[5] Type 2 is groundwater controlled and assumes an
equilibrium soil moisture profile (i.e., a balance between
gravitational and capillary forces) extending from the
groundwater upward. The soil moisture content in the root
zone is directly controlled by the depth of the groundwater.
Since simple analytical expressions exist for the equilibrium
profile, this type of models is computationally efficient.
Examples of this type of models are found in work by
Koster et al. [2000] and Hilberts et al. [2005].
[6] Type 3 is Richards’ equation based. In this type of
models, the Richards’ equation is solved over the full extent
of the unsaturated-saturated zone (including groundwater).
This approach is most realistic, but is computationally more
demanding because of the high number of soil layers.
Examples of this type of models are found in work by
Maxwell and Miller [2005], Yeh and Eltahir [2005], and Niu
et al. [2007].
[7] Under specific conditions the Richards’ equation can
be linearized, and vertical fluxes, including capillary rise,
can be computed analytically [Wang and Dooge, 1994;

Pullan, 1990, and references therein]. The main requirement
for this ‘‘quasi-linear approximation’’, however, is that the
unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is an exponential func-
tion of soil matric potential. See section 5.3 for a further
discussion.
[8] Type 4 is mixed. This type of models apply the
gravitational flux from the root zone downward as in type
1 models, but in addition there is a capillary flux from the
groundwater upward based on the (semi) analytical steady
state expressions of Gardner [1958] and Eagleson [1978].
An example of this type of models is TOPLATS [Famiglietti
and Wood, 1994]. Although this type of models is compu-
tationally efficient, the underlying assumptions are not
internally consistent (see discussion below). More modern
parameterizations of root zone–groundwater interaction
[e.g., Liang et al., 2003] use a more sophisticated yet
physically based approach, but are less numerically efficient.
[9] Models of types 1 and 2 have no real coupling
between the saturated and unsaturated zone. In the follow-
ing we will focus on type 4 models since they are relatively
simple, and yet they allow for a full coupling. We will use
the Darcy-Buckingham equation to develop a simple and
consistent parameterization for capillary fluxes that does not
only depend on the depth of the groundwater table, but also
on the soil moisture content of the root zone.
[10] A classic solution to the type 4 formulation is due to
Gardner [1958] and Eagleson [1978], who presented sim-
ple, physically based, analytical approximations for the
capillary rise from a groundwater at given depth (explained
in detail in section 2.2). The coupling between root zone
and groundwater is then obtained by taking the net effect of
both this (upward) capillary rise flux (which is a function of
depth Zg to the groundwater), and the (downward) gravity
drainage flux, which is a function of root zone moisture
content, expressed here as degree of saturation sr, or
equivalently root zone pressure head yr. Root zone moisture
is assumed to be uniform within the root zone Zr  z  0.
[11] The Gardner-Eagleson capillary rise formulation
has a number of underlying assumptions, one of which
is the assumption that the soil surface is completely dry,
i.e., sjz=0 = 0 or yjz=0 = 1. This assumption clearly is in
contradiction with the assumption of the gravity drainage
model, where 0  sr  1. Hence, a parameterization with
consistent underlying assumptions would be desirable.
[12] The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess the
effects of the conflicting assumptions underlying the above
described Gardner-Eagleson saturated-unsaturated interac-
tion flux against a physically based (Darcy equation)
approach and (2) to present a simple self-contained analyt-
ical parameterization of Darcy equation derived flux pre-
dictions, that fits the same boundary conditions as the
Gardner-Eagleson approach without sharing its problematic
underlying assumption, and is considerably faster than
numerical integration of the Richards’ equation.
[13] We consider the problem as sketched in Figure 1.
Immediately below the land surface there is a root zone,
with thickness Zr. In this paper we assume Zr = 50 cm,
although our parameterization does not depend on the value
of Zr. Moisture content (quantified here as the relative
degree of saturation sr) in this zone is assumed to be
vertically uniform. Groundwater is below the phreatic level
at depth Zg = Z + Zr. The intermediate zone, of thickness Z,
is called the transition zone. This transition zone includes
the capillary fringe, if present. Plotted in Figure 1 are (for a
unspecified soil) the hydrostatic moisture profile within the
transition zone, and a possible actual moisture profile.
2. Gardner-Eagleson Parameterization
[14] This section outlines the Gardner-Eagleson [Gardner,
1958; Eagleson, 1978] approach to saturated-unsaturated
interaction. Although the equations can be found in the
above cited references, they are repeated here to present a
self-contained description of the approach.
[15] It is assumed that all flow is vertical, and that flow
is governed by the one-dimensional Darcy-Buckingham
equation
q ¼ k @h
@z
¼ k @y
@z
þ 1
 
ð1Þ
where q is the water flux (positively upward), k is the
hydraulic conductivity, h = y + z is the hydraulic head, y is
the pressure head, and z is the elevation.
2.1. Gravity Drainage
[16] If one assumes that the moisture distribution within
the root zone is homogeneous, then
@y=@z ¼ 0 ð2Þ
that is, there are no capillary effects, and equation (1)
reduces to
qgrav ¼ k ð3Þ
Usually k is computed as a function of volumetric water
content q or pressure head y. In this paper we adopt the
Figure 1. Idealized moisture profile. A root zone of fixed
thickness Zr and uniform relative moisture content sr is
connected to a phreatic zone by a transition zone with
thickness Z.

Campbell [1974] water retention characteristic and k
parameterization, because of its parsimoniousness, and
because the parameters of this model are well documented
for many soil types [e.g., Clapp and Hornberger, 1978]. It
should be noted, though, that calibrated, pedon-scale
effective soil parameters are preferable above laboratory-
determined sample-scale parameters, to account for the
effects of soil heterogeneities.
[17] The Campbell [1974] water retention characteristic is
given by
y ¼ yaesb ð4Þ
where yae is the air entry pressure, s = q/qs, is the relative
saturation, qs is the saturated water content or porosity, and
b is a pore size distribution index. The corresponding k
parameterization is given by
kðsÞ ¼ kssc ð5Þ
where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity, and c = 2b +
3 is a pore disconnectedness index.
2.2. Capillary Rise Flux
[18] Gardner [1958] assumed that long-term evaporation
rate from a soil column is controlled by the steady capillary
rise flux from the groundwater, which is assumed to be at a
fixed depth Zg. Assuming quasi steady state, and solving the
Darcy-Buckingham equation (1) for z yields [Gardner,
1958]
z ¼ 
Z
dy
q=k þ 1 ð6Þ
assumed that the soil water retention characteristic can be
approximated by
k ¼ aðyÞb þ b ð7Þ
which enables analytical solutions for (6) for values of
b = 3/2, 2,3,4. Assuming that the maximum evaporation rate
or capillary rise flux qcap corresponds to the upper boundary
condition y ! 1 at the soil surface z = Zg and the lower
boundary condition y = 0 at the water table z = 0, Gardner
[1958] then proceeds showing that his solutions to (6) yield
the approximations
qcap ¼

2:46 aZ2g for b ¼ 2;
1:76 aZ3g for b ¼ 3;

[19] Eagleson [1978] proposed a slightly different version
of equation (8), using the Campbell [1974] retention
characteristics, equation (4) and (5) instead of equation (7).
This resulted in
qcap ¼ ksa yae

Exponent b is related to b (equation (4)) by

A complete formulation for the two-way interaction flux
between saturated and unsaturated stores can be obtained by
taking the net effect of gravity drainage qgrav (3) and
capillary rise qcap (4):
qnet ¼ qgrav þ qcap ð12Þ
which is the approach that has been used by, e.g.,
Famiglietti and Wood [1994] within the TOPLATS land
surface scheme.
3. Darcy Approach
[21] The validity of equation (12) is checked by compar-
ing the predicted fluxes with the fluxes that are associated
with quasi steady state moisture profiles, constrained by an
upper boundary condition of specified root zone moisture sr
(or equivalently, root zone pressure head yr) and specified
thickness of the transition zone Z. Apart of this procedure,
we replace Zg in equation (9) by Z. The original meaning of
equation (9) is to predict the flux between two boundaries
where pressure is defined, originally the phreatic surface
and the soil surface, and in our case the phreatic surface and
the bottom of the root zone.
[22] We do not consider a more dynamic approach (i.e.,
transient moisture profiles) because that would increase the
number of degrees of freedom beyond what could be
justified given the boundary conditions.
[23] The Darcy-Buckingham equation (1) is used to
compute the steady state moisture profile. Using k = k(y),
this can be rewritten as
@y
@z
¼  q
kðyÞ  1 ð13Þ
which can be used to compute the steady state moisture
profile s(z) for a given flux q by numerical integration over
the domain from z = Zr  Z to z = Zr and converting the
resulting y (z) profile to an equivalent s(z) profile. To this
end, the Campbell [1974] water retention characteristic (4)
and k parameterization (5) are used.
[24] Finding that value for q that results in the required sr
is achieved by means of a simple golden section search
[Press et al., 2002]. This approximation of q(sr,Z) will be
labeled qdarcy hereafter.
[25] The above routine can be applied to numerically
approximate qdarcy, which is interpreted here as the ’true’
value for the root zone–groundwater interaction flux. In the
next few sections, we both test the validity of qnet against
qdarcy, and provide simple parameterizations of the qdarcy

approximations (that is, removing the need for the ineffi-
cient iterative numerical routine outlined above).
[26] This procedure is broken up into two steps. First, for
a given value of Z, q(sr) approximations are evaluated and
new parameterizations are developed. In the second step Z
variability is taken into account.
[27] Alternatively, one may precompute qdarcy for many
combinations of Z and sr and build a lookup table with
them. This approach is not being discussed here.
4. Results
4.1. Step 1: Determination of q(sr)
[28] For a given transition zone thickness Z, the depen-
dence on the net flux q on root zone moisture sr can be
computed using either equation (12) or using the meth-
odology outlined above in section 3. An example of this
relationship for the sandy loam soil of Clapp and
Hornberger [1978] (see Table 1 for the soil hydraulic
parameters used) with a transition zone thickness of
Z = 100 cm is given in Figure 2.
[29] Several phenomena are apparent in Figure 2 with
respect to the numerical solutions qdarcy compared to the
analytical solution qnet. First, the analytically derived fluxes
qgrav and qcap act as limiting cases for qnet. qnet approaches
qgrav if the root zone moisture content approaches saturation
(sr ! 1). This is the result of the small vertical pressure
gradients under saturated conditions. For dry root zone
conditions (low sr) qnet approaches qcap. The analytically
derived flux qnet is a good approximation of the numerically
obtained flux qdarcy, for these limiting cases.
[30] Second, the numerical solution qdarcy deviates sig-
nificantly from qnet for intermediate values of qnet. The
interpretation for this behavior is that the assumptions
underlying the qcap model (esp. the assumption of a dry
soil surface) are not met.
[31] Note that the maximum rate of capillary rise in
Figure 2 is high, with a magnitude of 
10 cm/d. This is
an artifact of the static model setup, where the combination
of a relatively dry root zone, combined with a shallow
groundwater level produce a very steep hydraulic gradient,
resulting in a large flux. In a more realistic, dynamic,
setting, the water balance within the root zone will adapt
to the boundary conditions, such that this combination will
not occur, and the capillary rise flux will be constrained by
evaporation (see also Figure 10, below).
[32] A second example is shown in Figure 3, where the
same procedure is applied to the loam soil of Clapp
and Hornberger [1978], for a transition zone thickness of
Z = 80 cm. Here it can be seen that the analytically derived
flux qnet no longer is a good approximation of the numerically
obtained flux qdarcy for low values of sr. The asymptote of
qdarcy is significantly lower than the asymptote of qnet. The
explanation for this behavior is that for very shallow
groundwater tables, i.e., low transition zone thickness Z,
the capillary fringe is relatively thick. The impact of the
capillary fringe on the shape of the pressure and relative
moisture content profiles becomes significant, and this
affects the corresponding fluxes, resulting in a lower
capillary rise flux.
4.2. Step 2: Parameterizing q(sr)
[33] As expressed in the introduction, the aim of this
paper is not only to test the validity of the Gardner-Eagleson
Figure 2. Vertical flux q as a function of relative root zone
moisture content sr for a sandy loam soil with a transition
zone thickness of Z = 100 cm as computed by four different
methods: qdarcy, using the Darcy equation; qgrav, gravity
drainage from the root zone; qcap, capillary rise flux
according to the Gardner-Eagleson approximation; qnet,
the net effect of qgrav and qcap.

approximation with respect to the Darcy equation, but also
to construct a parameterization of the steady state Darcy
solution obtained flux rates. This requires two additional
steps: (1) to generate a parameterization of the Darcy
equation obtained flux rates for constant Z, as shown in
Figures 2 and 3, and (2) to include variable Z in such a
parameterization.
[34] A pragmatic way to numerically approximate the
predictions of Darcy equation fluxes qdarcy with respect to
qgrav, qcap, and qnet is to subtract qgrav from qdarcy, and
normalize by qcap. This results in a range 0. . .1, with 1
indicating that qdarcy is well approximated by qcap, which
should hold for low sr, and 0 indicating that qdarcy is well
approximated by qgrav, which should hold for high sr.
[35] The results of this approach are shown in Figures 4
and 5.
[36] The pattern of transformed and normalized flux rates,
plotted against relative root zone moisture sr strongly
suggest a sigmoid-type relationship
y ¼ sa
1þ expðsbðsr  sgÞÞ ð14Þ
where sa is the maximum value (sa = 1 if the effect of a
capillary fringe is small, 0 < sa < 1 otherwise), sb is a scale
parameter, and sg is a shift parameter. The result of
equation (14) fitted to the transformed and normalized flux
rates is also shown in Figures 4 and 5.
[37] Note that not all numerically obtained qdarcy points
are used for fitting. When sr approaches 1, the capillary
fringe effects can cause qdarcy to increase with respect to
qgrav. These points are detected and excluded from the
fitting procedure.
4.3. Including the Dependence on Z
[38] The q  sr relationship is thus defined by combining
the analytical predictors qgrav and qcap with the three
parameters sa, sb, sg that define a sigmoid, for a given
soil type, and a single value for Z. A practical way of
bringing Z into the parameterization is to find out how, for a
given soil type, sa, sb, sg depend on Z. This is achieved by
Figure 4. Transformed and normalized vertical flux rates
as a function of root zone moisture sr for a sandy loam soil
with a transition zone thickness of Z = 100 cm.

varying Z in steps of 25 cm within the range 25–500 cm
and fitting a sigmoid for each of these steps. The resulting
dependence of sa, sb, sg on Z is shown in Figure 6.
[39] The dependence of the sigmoid parameters on z
displays a relatively simple relationship. A satisfactory
approximation is given by the analytical functions

Sigmoid metaparameters k1. . . k5 have been obtained for all
11 soils described by Clapp and Hornberger [1978], and are
listed in Table 2.
5. Evaluation
[40] In this section, we compare the vertical fluxes as
predicted by our proposed parameterization with the Gard-
ner-Eagleson approximation, both in a static (i.e., constant
boundary conditions) and dynamic (i.e., time-variable
boundary conditions) framework. We also compare with
the quasi-linear approximation.
5.1. Static Evaluation
[41] Figures 7, 8, and 9 show the differences in predicted
fluxes according to our qdarcy parameterization, and the
Gardner-Eagleson approximation qnet. Because predicted
fluxes have both negative and positive values, it is not
possible to express the flux difference as a relative fraction
of, e.g., qdarcy. Therefore, both the reference flux qdarcy, and
the flux difference qnet  qdarcy are presented, for three soils
(sand, loam, clay) from the Clapp and Hornberger [1978]
database. It should be noted that for the loam and clay soils
q > ks for shallow groundwater tables. This is the effect of
the unrealistic high-pressure gradient associated with this
forcing.
[42] It can be seen in Figures 7–9 that qnet  qdarcy > 0
for all soils and boundary conditions, thus qnet never under
predicts with respect to qdarcy. It can be further seen that the
difference qnet  qdarcy is largest for high sr and for small Z.
Both these observations are in line with the findings
presented in Figure 3 and discussed in section 4.1. Note
that the difference qnet  qdarcy can be of the same order as
the reference flux qdarcy for shallow groundwater.
5.2. Dynamic Evaluation
[43] The dynamic effects of using the proposed parame-
terization instead of the Gardner-Eagleson flux depends on
many factors, but will be largest when the landscape system
studied will be wet for a significant amount of time.
Figure 10 shows the temporal evolution of hydrological
states and fluxes for a highly conceptualized setting, repre-
senting a humid climate in which precipitation is constant
throughout the year, while potential evapotranspiration and
vegetation phenology fluctuate in a seasonal fashion. Annual

average potential evapotranspiration rate equals average
precipitation rate. Root zone soil water balance is modeled
with the lumped model presented by Teuling and Troch
[2005], while capillary rise is either not modeled (represent-
ing the classic ‘‘leaky bucket’’ model approach), or modeled
with the Gardner-Eagleson approach, or the parameteriza-
tion presented here. Phreatic groundwater level is kept at a
fixed depth, assuming that capillary rise is balanced by
lateral supply. This assumption may describe the case where
groundwater within a riparian area or floodplain is fed by
lateral supply from either hillslopes bordering the riparian
area, or from a loosing stream within the floodplain. Soil
parameters are: sandy loam soil, thickness of transition zone
Z = 5 m. Additional model parameters for the Teuling and
Troch [2005] model are: max. Leaf area index 4.0, root zone
thickness L = 0.5 m, root fraction within L fr = 0.9, light
efficiency c = 0.5.
[44] It can be seen from Figure 10 that including the
capillary rise process has, in this case, a strong effect of
moisture fluctuations and transpiration. The dynamic range
in root zone water content is halved, because water supply
by capillary rise mitigates the drying out during the summer
season. Summertime transpiration is increased by 30–50%
because of the higher available moisture within the root

zone. Note, though, that in this simplified simulation the
groundwater level is fixed, while in many real applications
depletion of the groundwater reservoir will occur. For the
forcing and model parameters used, the difference in rela-
tive moisture content between the Gardner-Eagleson param-
eterization and ours is small, with an absolute value of

0.025. However, this is 
25% of the total dynamic range
in relative soil moisture of

5.3. Comparison With the Quasi-linear Approximation
[45] As outlined above, in section 1, analytical solutions
to the Richards’ equation can be derived provided the
unsaturated hydraulic conductivity–soil matric potential
relation is expressed as an exponential function, i.e.,
kðyÞ ¼ kseay ð18Þ
After applying the Kirchhoff transformation
f ¼

where f is known as the matric flux potential, the nonlinear
Richards’ equation becomes a linear differential equation,

[46] In order to apply equation (21), using soil hydraulic
data that are available as parameters for the Campbell
conductivity model, one has to convert c in equation (5)
to parameter a of the exponential model (18). Although
values for a can be found that result in the same vertical
fluxes as predicted by our proposed parameterization, or the
Gardner-Eagleson parameterization within its range of va-
lidity, these value for a differ significantly from those that
result from fitting the exponential conductivity model (18)
to the Campbell model (5). Apart from that, the sensitivity
of q to a is large. Further research to the applicability of the
quasi-linear approximation in case soil hydraulic data is
available for k parameterizations other than the exponential
one is required.
6. Discussion and Conclusions
[47] We have tested the classic Gardner-Eagleson analyt-
ical approximation of the root zone–groundwater interac-
tion flux, which is computed as the net effect of a downward
gravity drainage flux, and an upward capillary rise flux,
against numerical solutions using the Darcy equation, and
assuming steady state within the transition zone. We find
that errors in the Gardner-Eagleson flux qnet can be signif-
icant with respect to the Darcy flux qdarcy, especially for
high root zone moisture content and/or a shallow ground-
water level.
[48] We have developed a simple approximation of qdarcy,
consisting of a few analytical functions which parameterize
the effects of groundwater depth and root zone moisture. We
suggest that our new approximation should be selected
above the classic Gardner-Eagleson flux for applications
where the assumptions underlying the classic approximation
are not met. This is most likely the case in landscapes where
convergent topographies, riparian areas or wetlands are
abundant. For small-scale applications the spatial extent of
these areas is highly variable, and depends on the local
climatology, lithology and geomorphic setting.
[49] A rough estimate of the large-scale extent where this
conditions are met can be made by analyzing global maps of
soil moisture. Results of this paper indicate that our pro-
posed parameterization becomes relevant at least for relative
root zone moisture of s > 0.6. When considering the 0.25
resolution daily surface soil moisture products of Owe et al.
[2008], we find, after computing monthly averages to
eliminate high-frequency variability, that on average

10% of the land surface has a relative root zone moisture
of s = 0.6 or higher.
[50] It should be noted that current generation of land
surface schemes increasingly take capillary rise into ac-
count, using Richards’ equation solved for 10 or more
layers [Yeh and Eltahir, 2005; Miguez-Macho et al., 2007;
Niu et al., 2007], or a simplified yet physically based
approach, e.g., variable infiltration capacity–ground [Liang
et al., 2003]. However, these schemes are still much more
numerically demanding than the proposed parameterization,
making them less suitable for use in a high spatial resolution
or Monte Carlo setting, especially when desktop rather than
mainframe equipment is used. It it this type of applications
where the proposed parameterization would be in place,
provided that the underlying assumptions are met, and the
flexibility that is inherent to the Richards’ equation is not
required.
[51] One assumption is that the vertical movement of
water can adequately be described within a Darcy frame-
work, i.e., where the underlying soil physics, as expressed
in the soil water retention characteristics and the conduc-
tivity model hold. That is, preferential flow, soil hetero-
geneities etc. either have a limited effect, or these effects can
be cast into the deviation of pedon-scale ‘‘effective’’ hy-
draulic properties from sample-scale derived properties.
Analysis of water particle travel time distributions on the
hillslope scale suggest that lateral hydrologic fluxes on this
scale can still be adequately described from a Darcian
perspective [McGuire et al., 2005]
[52] One other assumption is that, when combining the
Gardner-Eagleson capillary rise model with a lumped root
zone model [e.g., Famiglietti and Wood, 1994; Teuling and
Troch, 2005] it is more important to adjust the capillary rise
model to the root zone model than vice versa. For example,
in some cases (e.g., coarse sands with a low organic matter
content) the assumption that the soil surface will be dry
during interstorm periods is more realistic than the assump-
tion of a uniform soil moisture content within the root zone.
Consequently the proposed methodology would be less
logical for those cases.
[53] A further assumption is that the quasi steady state
approach is a realistic approximation of a transient process.
Recently, the plausibility of this assumption was tested by
comparing a quasi steady state model (using a lookup table
approach, rather than an analytical approximation as we do)
with a fully dynamic Richards’ equation–based model, for
the 21 most characteristic soil types of the Netherlands,
using 2 years of observed meteorological forcing. For this
purpose, the SWAP land surface model was employed [van
Dam et al., 2008]. It was concluded that the quasi steady
state approach yields satisfactory (Nash-Sutcliffe >0.9)
results for 
75% of the total area of the Netherlands,
provided that the root zone is thin (
33 cm) and ground-
water is shallow (within 2 m of the soil surface) [van
Walsum and Groenendijk, 2008].
[54] Finally, it has been noted that the quasilinear ap-
proximation to the Richards’ equation is an alternative and
potentially interesting approach to surface–groundwater
fluxes, but more research here is required, especially be-
cause of the specific (exponential) conductivity model
required by that approach.
