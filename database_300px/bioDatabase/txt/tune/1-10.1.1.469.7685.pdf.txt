ABSTRACT
Question: Does performance specialization lead to trade-offs among contrasting
performance types?
Predictions: Evolutionary specialization for good performance at one task should result in
relatively poor performance at contrasting tasks. We predicted that species with good sprinting
ability would be relatively poor at the contrasting performance tasks of climbing, clinging, and
jumping.
Organisms: Eighteen species of Lygosomine skinks from a diverse range of habitats in
tropical Australia.
Methods: We measured four ecologically relevant modes of performance (sprinting, climbing,
clinging, and jumping) and relevant morphological traits (e.g. body size, fore- and hind-limb
length, body flatness).
Results: Contrary to predictions, phylogenetic analyses revealed a tight positive correlation
between sprinting and climbing ability, climbing and clinging ability, and climbing and
jumping. Sprinting, climbing, clinging, and jumping are presumably sufficiently similar tasks
for scincid lizards for no trade-offs to be observed. There was no evidence that a flat body
enhanced climbing in our study, but it may be related to energy efficiency in species from
habitats that climb frequently on vertical surfaces.
Conclusions: The absence of trade-offs among performance traits, the converse to what has
been observed for arboreal lizards (e.g. Anolis), suggests that such trade-offs are not general for
lizards from all habitats or groups.
Keywords: ecomorphology, habitat specialization, performance, skinks, trade-offs.
INTRODUCTION
Natural selection acts on morphological traits, in theory shaping them to optimize habitat
use (Futuyma, 1998; Schluter, 2000). Thus, based on the premise that form follows function,
studying performance in the context of habitat variability provides a powerful test of
adaptive traits (Arnold, 1983; Ricklefs and Miles, 1994; Lauder, 1996). It seems intuitive that some

adaptations promoting excellent performance in a single habitat might reduce performance
in other habitats, so that the ‘jack-of-all-trades is master of none’ (Huey and Hertz, 1984a; Futuyma
and Moreno, 1988). Limb length of arboreal lizards provides a clear example of an adaptation
that causes a trade-off between performance ability in one habitat compared with others:
Anolis with long limbs that occupy wide perches are quick and agile (Losos, 1990a, 1990b; Losos et
al., 1994; Irschick and Losos, 1998; Irschick, 2000), but have reduced speed and agility on narrow perches
(Losos and Sinervo, 1989; Macrini and Irschick, 1998). Similarly, chameleons trade-off sprint speed
against clinging ability as leg length increases (Losos et al., 1993). However, in lacertid lizards,
a group that uses wide, flat substrates such as rock, there appears to be no trade-off between
sprinting and climbing ability for species with longer limbs (Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001).
Thus, whereas the link between limb length and performance has been well explored (Garland,
1985; Losos 1990a; Garland and Losos, 1994), the extent to which morphology may constrain
performance, causing trade-offs in performance in different habitats, remains a relatively
open question (Losos and Sinervo, 1989; Sinervo and Losos, 1991; Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001). Many
trade-offs appear to depend on the substrate used. Examining the evolution of morphology
(body shape and limb length) and performance in a group that uses a variety of substrates
might clarify whether trade-offs are substrate-dependent.
Skinks occupy a wide array of habitats and exhibit a diverse range of morphologies, with
different body shapes and limb lengths (Cogger and Heatwole, 1984; Greer, 1989; Melville and Swain, 2000;
Pianka and Vitt, 2003). Long limbs and dorsoventral flattening associated with rock-using have
evolved independently several times in Australian skinks (Ingram and Rawlinson, 1981; Covacevich,
1984; Greer, 1989; B.A. Goodman, unpublished data). Biomechanical theory predicts that long hind-limbs
are beneficial for locomotion of ground-dwelling species in open habitats, where they enable
longer strides and faster locomotion (Cartmill, 1985; Pounds, 1988; Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001).
Climbing species should have equal-length fore- and hind-limbs in order to grip securely
(Cartmill, 1985; Losos et al., 1993) and to stride similar distances with both limbs (Arnold, 1998;
Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001). Some climbing species have dorsoventrally flattened bodies,
possibly to lower the centre of gravity and prevent toppling, and rigid bodies with reduced
lateral bending perhaps to increase stability (Van Damme et al., 1997). Despite the putative benefits
of a flattened morphology for climbing, there has been no test of the influence of flattening
on performance (Herrel et al., 2002). Moreover, lacertid lizards show little evidence of body
flattening or morphological differentiation among habitats (Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 1999).
Thus, an investigation of performance trade-offs using a group of morphologically
divergent species should help to determine whether performance trade-offs due to limb
length are generally present.
We measured four performance traits (sprinting, climbing, clinging, and jumping) in
related scincid lizards that use a range of different habitats (trees, rocks, ground, and leaf
litter), to examine how morphology and performance are related in lizards that use a variety
of substrates, have different morphologies, and are not specialized solely for arboreal
climbing. Specifically, we examined: (i) the relationship between key morphological traits
and performance, and (ii) whether there was evidence for trade-offs among sprinting,
climbing, clinging, and jumping of lizards with different morphological traits.
METHODS
Skinks in the sub-family Lygosominae occupy a range of microhabitat types [e.g. boulder-
dominated mountains, rocky coastal inter-tidal zones, leaf litter, open ground, and trees
Goodman et al.528
(Greer, 1989; Cogger, 2000)] and exhibit a broad array of morphological variation in body shape
and limb length (Greer, 1989; Cogger, 2000). To explore the effect of evolutionary changes in
morphology on locomotion in skinks, species from five genera (Cryptoblepharus, Carlia,
Eulamprus, Lampropholis, Techmarscincus) and a diverse range of microhabitat types
were examined (Ingram and Covacevich, 1980, 1989; Ingram and Rawlinson, 1981; Cogger, 2000; Goodman,
in press).
Lizard sampling and captive husbandry
All species used in this study occur in tropical north-east Australia, and were collected by
hand with the aid of baited sticky traps or with pit-fall traps modified for rocky habitats
(Goodman and Peterson, 2005). In the laboratory, all individuals were maintained separately in a
plastic container of one of three sizes for small (snout-to-vent length [SVL] < 45 mm,
350 mm long × 130 mm wide × 100 mm high), medium (SVL = 45–75 mm, 350 × 230 ×
100 mm) or large individuals (SVL > 75 mm, 550 × 360 × 305 mm). Each container
consisted of a substrate of moist potting mix (to a depth of 8–10 mm), a bark refuge, and
water bowl, and was placed on a rack with a heating element positioned at one end that
produced a thermal gradient within each box (range 23–45C) that spanned the preferred
body temperature range of the genera examined (Greer, 1980, 1989; B.A. Goodman, unpublished data).
Containers were heated from 08.00 to 18.00 h and the temperature dropped to 23 ± 2C
when the heating was switched off. The photoperiod matched local tropical conditions and
was produced by standard overhead fluorescent lighting that was on from 07.00 to 19.00 h.
All captive lizards were fed a combination of live Tenebrio larvae and crickets dusted with
mineral supplement (Repti-cal® ) ad libitum.
Morphological measurements
All measurements were taken from live animals by first cooling each individual to 18 ± 1C
for a minimum of an hour. To avoid potential confounding effects of pregnancy on
performance, only male lizards were used in the experiments. The following morphological
traits were measured directly using digital callipers (± 0.01 mm): snout-to-vent length, body
mass, inter-limb length, head width, head length, head height, tail length (if regenerated,
both the original and regenerated tail portions), pectoral height, pectoral width, pelvis
height, and pelvis width. In addition, each individual was radiographed to provide
precise measurements of all skeletal elements. Radiograph measures were taken by first
cooling each individual (as above) before securing it to a plexiglass plate (450 × 340 × 3 mm)
using 3M Micropore Surgical tape (Hoefer et al., 2003). Metal staples (12.9 mm wide × 6.2 mm
high) fixed to the surface of each plate provided a size reference. Lizards were radiographed
at two power intensities depending on the lizard’s size: small-to-medium species
(SVL = 30–75 mm) were radiographed at an exposure of 22 kV and 18 mA. Species with a
snout-to-vent length > 75 mm were radiographed at an exposure of 24 kV and 20 mA.
All skeletal measurements were taken directly from radiographs using digital callipers
(± 0.01 mm) viewed on a light table at 20 × magnification. Repeated measures of
radiographed staples and actual staple dimensions were used to scale a correction factor for
all the skeletal measurements. All direct and radiograph measurements were taken three
times and the mean used in the analyses.

Performance measures
Before conducting the performance trials, each individual was transferred in its container
to a constant-temperature heating chamber set to 32C (30C for Eulamprus), where
individuals were allowed to acclimate for at least an hour before each performance trial.
This temperature range is within the field active body temperature range of members of
these genera (Greer, 1989; B.A. Goodman, unpublished data). Only one performance trait was recorded
per day, with at least one day between consecutive performance trials. Sprint speed was
determined using a 2-m horizontal racetrack with a series of infra-red sensors positioned at
100-mm intervals along the entire length of the track. To ensure lizards were detected
during normal locomotion (see below), two infra-red sensors were positioned one on top
the other 5 mm apart at each interval along the length of the racetrack. The surface of the
racetrack was course particle size sandpaper that provided excellent traction. Speed was the
time elapsed between successive breaks of a series of beams positioned at 100-mm intervals
along the length of racetrack. A trial began when a single lizard was removed from the
incubator and placed at the start of the racetrack and encouraged to sprint using an artist’s
paintbrush. Each lizard was raced with at least an hour between successive trials and each
trial was rated as either ‘good’ or ‘poor’. A trial was rated as ‘poor’ if an individual jumped
along or out of the raceway, turned 180 and ran in the opposite direction along the
raceway, or simply stopped and refused to run the full length of the raceway. Trials were
rated ‘good’ if individuals ran relatively constantly (i.e. only paused momentarily) while
running along the entire length of the raceway.
Climbing ability was measured as for sprint speed except with the racetrack placed on a
70 angle; only individuals that produced two or more ‘good’ climbing trials were used in
analyses. Both sprinting and climbing used the maximum 0.5-m interval as the measure of
speed.
Cling performance was measured using a 5-g (for small Carlia and Lampropholis), 60-g
(large Carlia, Cryptoblepharus, Lampropholis, Techmarscincus) or 300-g (the two Eulamprus
species) Pesola spring-balance connected to a 25-cm long fine-gauge nylon fishing line
(5 kg) with a slipknot noose tied to one end (Losos, 1990a; Zani, 2000). Trials were conducted
by placing each individual on a flat, horizontal board covered with medium-course grain
sandpaper. Each lizard was attached to the spring-balance by placing the noose around the
mid-body just anterior to the pelvis, such that the line connecting the spring-balance was
parallel to the lizards’ body axis (Zani, 2000). Each trial consisted of placing a single lizard on
the test surface and applying force at a constant horizontal speed (0.3 m · s−1) in a posterior
direction until the lizard became dislodged (Losos, 1990a; Zani, 2000). Trials were conducted on
each individual and graded as ‘good’ or ‘poor’ depending on whether an individual
maintained a posture with outstretched limbs with the ventral surface in contact with the
test surface; a minimum of two ‘good’ trials were obtained for each individual.
Jump distance was measured by placing each individual onto a circular podium (25 cm
high × 13 cm wide at the top) positioned in the centre of a circular arena (130 cm diameter
and 35 cm high) lined with sand to a depth of 5 cm. Individuals were encouraged to jump by
lightly tapping the base of the tail using an artist’s paintbrush. Jump distance was recorded
as the maximal radial distance between the landing point of a lizard and the base of the
podium. Individuals that did not jump within 15 s were returned to their box and placed
back in the constant-temperature chamber to acclimate for another hour before being
re-tested. Three jumps were recorded for each individual.

Statistical analyses
Mean values for each morphological measure for each species was log10-transformed before
analyses to improve normality (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). Each trait was regressed against log10-
transformed snout-to-vent length and the residuals calculated and used in subsequent
analyses as size-corrected performance and morphological measures. Body height was
calculated as the mean of mid-body, pectoral, and pelvis height. Biomechanical predictions
posit that terrestrial lizards should have shorter fore-limbs than hind-limbs. We calculated
the limb ratio using a regression of log hind-limb length regressed against log fore-limb
length (Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001; Zaaf and Van Damme, 2001). Furthermore, the tibia should be
long relative to the femur in the hind-limb of ground dwelling species to assist rapid running
on broad, level surfaces. However, in climbers, both limbs should have a low intra-limb
ratio, which should increase the ability to grip perches (Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001). We
calculated tibia–femur length from the regression of tibia length against femur length
(Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001). Species with a large tibia–femur length have a long tibia
relative to their femur.
Related species share, to varying extents, part of their evolutionary history and for this
reason do not constitute independent data (Felsenstein, 1985; Harvey and Pagel, 1991). Consequently,
conventional statistical tests are invalid if used directly for interspecifc comparisons.
The use of phylogenetic comparative methods that account for phylogenetic relationships
provides a solution to this impasse. Phylogenetic comparative methods that incorporate
Felsenstein’s (1985) method of independent contrasts require information on the relation-
ships between species, including correct information on the phylogenetic topology, branch
lengths proportional to known variance in character evolution, character evolution that
occurs by a process of Brownian motion, and little within-species variation within traits of
interest (Felsenstein, 1985; Harvey and Pagel, 1991). However, although it is necessary to conduct
analyses within a phylogenetic framework, whether hypotheses based on phylogenetic or
conventional statistics should be considered more informative depends on whether the data
show evidence of significant phylogenetic signal (Freckleton et al., 2002; Blomberg et al., 2003; Garland
et al., 2005). The descriptive statistic K provides one index of the amount of phylogenetic signal
within a trait, based on the Brownian motion model of evolution of a given phylogenetic
tree with known topology and branch lengths (Blomberg et al., 2003). K-values equal to 1 indicate
that a trait shows an expected amount of phylogenetic signal, whereas K-values less than 1
indicate a trait has less signal than expected and values of K greater than 1 suggest there is
more phylogenetic signal than expected. To test for phylogenetic signal and calculate a K
statistic and P-value for tests of significance for each trait, we used the program PHYSIG.M
(Blomberg et al., 2003), as implemented in the program MatLab. We performed 1000 randomiza-
tions on the current ‘best-estimate’ phylogeny and report K-values for all morphological
traits examined in this study (Blomberg et al., 2003) (Table 1). However, while K-values are likely
to be more than 80% reliable for phylogenies consisting of 20 or more species, they are
considerably less so for phylogenies with fewer than 20 species. As this study consisted of
18 species, we also report P-values for significance testing of all traits as produced
in PHYSIG.M to provide an additional diagnostic of whether traits display phylogenetic
signal (Blomberg et al., 2003).
The phylogenetic hypothesis used in this study (Fig. 1) was based on current ‘best-
estimate’ phylogenetic relationships of the molecular (Stuart-Fox et al., 2002), immunological
(Hutchinson et al., 1990), and morphological relationships for members of the scincid sub-family
No performance trade-offs in tropical lizards 531
Lygosominae (Ingram and Covacevich, 1989). Supra-generic positions of genera were based on the
phylogenetic relationships reported in Reeder (2003), with additional information taken from
Hutchinson et al. (1990) and Greer (1989) for Lampropholis and T. jigurru (as Leiolopisma
jigurru). While the position of E. quoyii was provided within Reeder (2003), the position of
E. brachysoma was inferred from the close relationships and inclusion within the E. murrayi
species group (Greer, 1989). The position of Cryptoblepharus was based on the inter-generic
basis that the most primitive members of this genus are closely related to Emoia (Greer, 1974).
A recent molecular phylogeny of the genus Carlia (the rainbow skinks) failed to resolve
fully many of the relationships within this genus and proposed Lygisaurus should be
synonymized with Carlia where they form a small clade nested within the overall Carlia
phylogeny (Stuart-Fox et al., 2002). Additional sequence data from several new Carlia species
failed to enhance the phylogenetic relationships (Couper et al., 2005), and the presence of
unresolved polytomies within the genus Carlia likely reflects a rapid (explosive) speciation
event that probably occurred from the mid-Miocene onwards (Stuart-Fox et al., 2002). The pos-
ition of C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis was based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
evidence (Dolman and Moritz, 2006). Species in this study formerly within Lygisaurus (i.e. Carlia
rococo and C. laevis) were placed in this sub-clade with several other arrangements also used
in analyses. The position of C. scirtetis was based on evidence from morphological traits
shared with the species C. coensis and C. mundivensis, with additional analyses performed
with this species placed in other phylogenetic arrangements. As branch length information
was not available for most species used in this study, branch lengths were set to unity.
Several studies have shown that setting branch lengths to unity produces results that
are robust and reliable (Diaz-Uriarte and Garland, 1996, 1998). As analyses involving all other
phylogenetic arrangements, with and without polytomies treated as ‘hard’ (Purvis and Garland
1993; Garland and Diaz-Uriarte 1999), did not qualitatively change the analyses, we report only results
for analyses using the ‘best-estimate’ phylogeny with potential polytomies treated as hard in
this paper.

Goodman et al.532
Independent contrasts were calculated for all morphological and performance data sets
using PDTREE. Because significant linear and non-linear trends indicate inadequate
standardization of branch lengths, both statistical correlations and visual inspection of all
diagnostic plots were performed. Contrasts of trait values were checked for adequacy of
standardization by dividing the independent contrast of each trait by the standard deviation
of the branch length (square root of the corrected branch lengths) for that trait (Garland et al.,
1992). However, as there was no evidence of any trends within the data (r < 0.4; all
P-values > 0.12), branch lengths were considered adequately standardized under the Brown-
ian motion model of evolution. The independent contrasts of the morphological data were
size-corrected by regressing (through the origin) the standardized independent contrast
of the trait of interest against the standardized independent contrast of snout-to-vent
length (Garland et al., 1992).

species: H17009, arboreal; , generalist; , leaf-litter dwelling; , rock-using.
No performance trade-offs in tropical lizards 533
Limb ratio was calculated using an ordinary least-squares regression of the
contrasts of hind-limb length against the contrasts of fore-limb length (Vanhooydonck and Van
Damme, 2001; Zaaf and Van Damme, 2001). Tibia–femur length was calculated from the regression
of the contrasts of tibia length against the contrasts of femur length (Vanhooydonck and
Van Damme, 2001).
To determine those morphological traits (body height, fore-limb length, hind-limb
length, and tibia–femur ratio) – both phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic – that accounted
for most of the variation in performance, we used backwards stepwise, multiple regression
[phylogenetic data through the origin (see Garland et al., 1992)]. This technique provides a partial
regression coefficient (β) between the response variable (performance trait) and significant
morphological traits with each of the other variables statistically held constant. As
correlated predictors may introduce problems of (multi)collinearity in multiple regression
analyses, we tested that tolerance among correlated variables was above 0.1 (Quinn and Keough,
2002). Initial data inspection revealed fore-limb and hind-limb length were highly correlated,
with low tolerance (both < 0.09). Consequently, we used the measure of limb-length with
the highest significant correlation with each performance measure. In the absence of a
significant correlation, we used hind-limb length, due to its importance in most aspects of
lizard locomotion (Garland, 1985; Garland and Losos, 1994; Bonine and Garland, 1999). The use of a single
measure of limb-length in the analyses considerably increased tolerance (all > 0.2).
We report partial regression coefficients (β) ± standard errors and model r2 values for both
non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic analyses.
RESULTS
Non-phylogenetic analyses
Considerable interspecific differences in size and morphology were observed (Table 2),
with a similar degree of interspecific variation in performance among the species
examined (Table 3). There was a significant positive correlation between sprinting and
climbing speed (r = 0.55, P = 0.01) and between climbing speed and cling force (r = 0.76,
P < 0.001; Fig. 2, Table 3). All other performance measures were not significantly correlated
(Table 4).
A backwards, stepwise multiple-regression model with residual sprint speed as the
dependent variable and residual body height, hind-limb length, and the ratio of tibia–femur
length as independent variables resulted in a significant model (r2 = 0.54, F1,17 = 5.44,
P = 0.011), with body height as the only contributing independent variable, indicating
that lizards with flatter bodies sprint faster (partial regression coefficient β ± standard
error = −0.748 ± 0.199). The same model using climbing speed as the dependent variable
identified fore-limb length as the only contributing variable (r2 = 0.72, F1,17 = 11.98,
P < 0.001): species with longer fore-limbs climb faster (β = 0.780 ± 0.297). Cling force was
determined by fore-limb length (r2 = 0.50, F1,17 = 4.73, P = 0.018), so that species with
longer fore-limbs cling more strongly (β = 0.991 ± 0.395). There was no relationship
between jump distance and any of the morphological variables measured (r2 = 0.26,
F1,17 = 1.63, P = 0.228). Interestingly, sprint speed was negatively correlated with the degree
of body flattening (Fig. 3); however, this relationship did not hold for the phylogenetic
comparison (Table 4).

Phylogenetic analyses
Overall, the results from the phylogenetically corrected data were broadly congruent
with those of the uncorrected data. The four measures of performance were all positively
correlated with each other (Table 4), with sprinting speed significantly positively correlated
with climbing speed (r = 0.71, P < 0.001; Fig. 2). Climbing speed was significantly correlated
with the ability to cling to a rock-like substrate (r = 0.67, P < 0.001; Fig. 2), and climbing
ability was significantly positively correlated with jump distance (r = 0.59, P < 0.05;
Fig. 2). There was a positive non-significant relationship between cling force and sprint
speed.
In a backwards, stepwise multiple regression (through the origin) with sprint speed as the
dependent variable and the residual contrasts of body height, hind-limb length, and the
ratio of tibia–femur length as independent variables, only hind-limb length contributed
significantly (r2 = 0.75, F1,16 = 40.56, P < 0.001), indicating that the evolution of longer
hind-limbs has coincided with faster sprint speeds (partial regression coefficient
β = 0.856 ± 0.135). A similar model, using jump distance as the dependent variable, was not
significant (r2 = 0.20, F1,16 = 1.14, P > 0.36). The same model with climbing speed as the
dependent variable indicated that residual contrasts of fore-limb length contributed signifi-
cantly to variation in climbing speed (r2 = 0.87, F1,16 = 62.51, P < 0.001). This suggests that
increased fore-limb length has evolved in concert with an increase in climbing speed

(β = 0.795 ± 0.101). A similar model with cling force as the dependent variable retained
residual contrasts of fore-limb length as the only variable contributing significantly to the
model (r2 = 0.43, F1,16 = 6.11, P < 0.05), indicating that an increase in fore-limb length
evolved in concert with clinging ability (β = 0.515 ± 0.209).
DISCUSSION
Specialization for a given task is thought to preclude simultaneous specialization for others,
thus preventing specialized species from performing well at multiple tasks [e.g. ‘jack-of-all-
trades is master of none’ (Huey and Hertz, 1984a; Stearns, 1992)]. However, in cases where selection
for performance at one task enhances performance in other areas (e.g. sprinting, climbing,
and clinging), there might be no trade-off in ability. We found no evidence of trade-offs in
performance at sprinting, climbing, and clinging in this group of skinks; instead, good
performance in one of these tasks was positively correlated with good performance in the
others. Differences in limb length explained much of the variation in performance among
species, with sprint speed correlated with hind-limb length, whereas climbing speed and
clinging ability were correlated with fore-limb length. Hind- and fore-limb lengths were

correlated as well. However, despite theoretical predictions, phylogenetic analyses revealed
no evidence that the evolution of a flatter body per se has led to a direct performance
benefit.
Absence of performance trade-offs
Biomechanical predictions suggest performance trade-offs should occur when morpho-
logical traits that enhance performance at one task negatively affect another. Based on this
reasoning, some studies have predicted a trade-off between sprinting and climbing, as
morphological traits optimal for horizontal locomotion apparently oppose those required
for optimal vertical locomotion (Cartmill, 1985; Zaaf et al., 1999; Zaaf and Van Damme, 2001). However, we
found no support for this, as all performance measures (including both horizontal and
vertical locomotion) were positively associated. Recent work suggests that trade-offs among
performance abilities must be considered within the ecological context of the group
examined (Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001). No trade-offs were observed among sprinting,
clambering, and climbing in lacertid lizards (Vanhooydonck and Van Damme, 2001). Thus, the
relationships between sprinting, climbing, and clinging for scincids resemble those of
lacertids. The strong positive correlation between sprinting and climbing in both these
groups, and between clinging and climbing in scincids, implies that these traits require
similar morphological features.
Positive correlations between sprinting and climbing are directly opposite to the findings
for Anoles and chameleons, where trade-offs occur between sprinting speed and climbing
speed. Characters enhancing sprinting and climbing apparently vary with substrate use.
Anoles and chameleons use twigs and branches as perches (Schoener, 1968; Losos, 1990a; Irschick et al.,
1997), whereas skinks and lacertids typically use broad (relative to the lizard’s body width),
flat substrates such as rocks, bare earth, and leaf litter (Pianka, 1969; Vanhooydonck and Van Damme,
1999; B.A. Goodman, unpublished data). Surprisingly, the morphological features that enhance
sprinting and climbing speed on broad surfaces do not enhance the same performance traits
on narrow perches.
The apparent absence of trade-offs among performance traits in skinks and lacertids
does not mean that they do not occur in other areas. For example, body shape has a strong
influence on reproductive output in lizards (Vitt and Congdon, 1978; Vitt, 1981; Vitt and Price, 1982), and
the flat body of many fast, rock-using skinks may reduce fecundity. Alternatively, a
trade-off may occur in other performance measures, such as endurance (Vanhooydonck et al.,
2001). However, the clear message from this study is that morphologically more derived
species are simply better at a greater range of tasks that are sufficiently similar that no
trade-offs among them occur.

Limb length and performance
In this study, lizards with longer hind-limbs sprinted faster. This relationship has been noted
for lizards and in other vertebrate groups (e.g. Losos, 1990a; Garland and Janis, 1993; Garland and Losos,
1994), and is caused by the increased stride length achieved with longer hind-limbs (Hildebrand,
1974; Cartmill, 1985; Losos, 1990a). Losos (1990b) observed an inverse relationship between fore-limb
length and sprint speed in 14 species of Anolis. But for the group of scincids in our study,
there was no indication that running was impeded by long fore-limbs; longer fore-limbs
were either unrelated to running speed (uncorrected data) or were strongly positively
correlated with running speed (phylogenetically corrected data). Climbing speed was also
enhanced by long fore-limbs, and by long fore-limbs and hind-limbs. Increased fore-limb
length, or fore-limbs and hind-limbs of equal length, are beneficial for climbing species, as it
allows them to stride similar distances with each limb (Arnold, 1998; Vanhooydonck and Van Damme,
2001). Individuals climbing angled substrates should also benefit from increased tension
provided by longer fore-limbs, which would prevent tumbling backwards (Cartmill, 1985;
Alexander, 1992; Aerts et al., 2003). Relative to the width of their body, the species in this study
generally occupy broad substrates, such as rocks (B.A. Goodman, unpublished data). Thus, longer
hind- and fore-limbs appear to combine to allow increased stride length, equal stride length,
and increased pulling forces to enhance locomotion when climbing.
A direct consequence of increased running speed in lizards is the tendency for the body to
lift, leading to bipedal locomotion (Aerts et al., 2003). While increased stride length increases
speed, the increased propensity for the fore-body to lift in a way that leads to bipedalism
presents an obvious problem of flipping backwards on inclined surfaces (Aerts et al., 2003). In

climbing lizards, morphological traits that lower the centre of mass and bring it forward
should reduce the possibility of fore-body lifting. In addition to body flattening (Van Damme
et al., 1997), these traits include increased fore-limb length to widen the base of support,
and a more sprawled form of locomotion (Aerts et al., 2003). Our study found support for
increased fore-limb length to increase performance in climbing and clinging, and while
non-phylogenetic analyses revealed that body flattening aided sprint performance, the
phylogenetic analyses did not support this finding (see ‘Alternative hypotheses for the role
of body flattening’ below).
Lizards with longer fore-limbs had greater clinging ability. The basis of this increased
clinging ability is unclear, but may be related to an increased base of support (Aerts et al., 2003),
or an increased number of sub-digital lamellae, which may increase frictional forces and
improve contact on irregular surfaces (Cartmill, 1985; Losos, 1990a). Increased clinging ability in
species with longer fore-limbs should also assist climbing by improving traction on an
inclined slope. In a comparative examination of lizard clinging ability, Zani (2000) found that
an evolutionary increase in claw height and a reduction in toe length were correlated with
an increased ability to cling to course substrates, but provided no information on how
limb-length was related to cling ability or toe length. In another study (Goodman, in press),
I found that limb-length and digit-length were strongly correlated in this group of scincids,
suggesting that increased limb-length and toe-length may act in concert to increase clinging
ability in this group. For example, species with longer limbs may be able to produce greater
tension, or may possess greater amounts of muscle mass or different muscle fibre types that
are better suited for clinging. Increased amounts of muscle mass in long-limbed species
is unlikely in this group, with most high-performance species having thin, gracile limbs;
however, muscle fibre types have not been examined.
Jumping ability was correlated with both fore-limb and hind-limb length in this study.
There should be a tight correlation between relative hind-limb length and jump perform-
ance (Emerson, 1985; Losos et al., 1989; Losos, 1990a, 1990b; Harris and Steudel, 2002), as a greater hind-limb
length provides a greater distance over which it can extend and accelerate the body (Cartmill,
1985; Alexander, 1992). The correlation between fore-limb length and jump distance is presumably
due to the tight correlation between fore-limb and hind-limb lengths (Table 4). That is,
species with long hind-limbs jump the greatest distances, but also have long fore-limbs; it is
unlikely that long fore-limbs are directly related to increased jump distance (Emerson, 1985;
Losos, 1990a).
The absence of performance trade-off may be the result of reduced selection on
performance in some situations, such as species that occupy closed habitats, or which use
crypsis as a predator avoidance strategy. For example, selection on performance ability
may be maximal in high-performance species, and considerably lower for low-performance
species. Under this scenario, interspecific comparisons of performance would still be
positive with no evidence of a trade-off, even if high-performance taxa do experience
performance trade-offs.
An important consideration for comparative studies is the presumption that all species
will undergo evolutionary changes in morphology that lead to greater performance. Even
in the absence of constraints, natural selection may only shape individuals to be ‘just
good enough’ to perform those tasks relevant to the habitats they occupy. Thus, while
species that inhabit more specialized habitats will display associated performance traits,
the prediction that they will perform the best at these performance tasks might not always
be upheld.
No performance trade-offs in tropical lizards 541
Alternative hypotheses for the role of body flattening
While the non-phylogenetic analyses suggest there is a benefit of body flattening on sprint
speed in scincid lizards, this relationship disappeared in the phylogenetic analyses, which
suggests this relationship is relatively weak. Counter to predictions, there was no evidence
that dorsoventral flattening aided climbing, despite a relatively strong (phylogenetic)
correlation between body flattening and climbing speed. In this case, a comparison
involving a larger number of species might prove worthwhile. However, dorsoventral
flattening may have a more indirect benefit on climbing not identified in this study.
One aspect of vertical locomotion that would likely benefit from a flatter body is energy
efficiency. Efficiency of locomotion at low temperatures might have been an important
factor in the evolution and ecology of arboreal lizards, such as geckos (Autumn et al., 1999;
Zaaf and Van Damme, 2001). For example, a ground-dwelling skink used almost 200% more energy
to perform one unit of vertical work than a climbing gecko (Farley and Emshwiller, 1996). Within
a taxonomic group, more dorsoventrally flattened species should expend less energy on
postural adjustments and overcoming the forces of gravity due to their lowered centre of
mass and reduced propensity to topple backwards on inclined surfaces [e.g. Plica plica (Vitt,
1991; Aerts et al., 2003)]. In this scenario, body flattening may be unrelated to climbing speed,
but would allow species to perform such tasks more efficiently. The majority of species in
this study, other than E. quoyii, are relatively light (< 6 g) and weigh considerably less than
the threshold mass (40 g) at which climbing performance is notably reduced by a heavy body
in agamids (Huey and Hertz, 1982, 1984b). However, it is unknown whether climbing species in this
study had lowered energetic costs, relative to non-climbing congeners. Field observations
of flattened, rock-using species (e.g. Carlia scirtetis) indicate that they are extremely
swift-moving (Goodman, in press), relative to less flattened congeners. To test this idea, future
research should include measurements of field metabolic rates, energetic costs of climbing,
and food acquisition and assimilation efficiency.
A further, alternative hypothesis for the function of a flat body is that it may increase
the ease with which individuals can take refuge in crevices, as do iguanids (Vitt, 1981; Vitt et al.,
1997; Pianka and Vitt, 2003). While plausible, field observations of many of the flattest rock-using
species in this study suggest that the evolution of flatness as an adaptation for crevice use
is relatively minor for this group of skinks (personal observation). When approached, most species
tend to use large gaps (relative to the height of the lizard) between rocks or rock overhangs
as refuges (Goodman, in press). In addition, when observed inside rock crevices, these species do
not wedge themselves into the narrowest part of the crevices and lack the sharply keeled
scales that aid this behaviour in other taxa [e.g. Egernia cunninghami group (Cogger, 2000;
Chapple, 2003)]. An additional alternative hypothesis is that a flattened body may assist a
species to remain undetected against the substrate. A flat body, dorsal colouration that
matches the background, and remaining motionless at the approach of a predator have
co-evolved in numerous iguanian lizard clades (Schulte et al., 2004). Indeed, most of the
flattened, rock-using species examined in this study exhibit dorsal colouration that matches
the rocks they typically occupy (Ingram and Rawlinson, 1981; Ingram and Covacevich, 1989), suggesting this
could be a strategy used by this group of lizards.
