ABSTRACT
Replacement of one ammine in clinically ineffective
trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] (transplatin) by a planar N-
heterocycle, thiazole, results in significantly
enhanced cytotoxicity. Unlike ‘classical’ cisplatin
{cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2]} or transplatin, modification of
DNA by this prototypical cytotoxic transplatinum
complex trans-[PtCl2(NH3)(thiazole)] (trans-PtTz)
leads to monofunctional and bifunctional intra or
interstrand adducts in roughly equal proportions.
DNA fragments containing site-specific bifunctional
DNA adducts of trans-PtTz were prepared. The struc-
tural distortions induced in DNA by these adducts
and their consequences for high-mobility group
protein recognition, DNA polymerization and nucleo-
tide excision repair were assessed in cell-free media
by biochemical methods. Whereas monofunctional
adducts of trans-PtTz behave similar to the major
intrastrand adduct of cisplatin [J. Kasparkova,
O. Novakova, N. Farrell and V. Brabec (2003)
Biochemistry, 42, 792–800], bifunctional cross-links
behave distinctly differently. The results suggest
that the multiple DNA lesions available to trans-
planaramine complexes may all contribute substan-
tially to their cytotoxicity so that the overall drug cyto-
toxicity could be the sum of the contributions of each
of these adducts. However, acquisition of drug resist-
ance could be a relatively rare event, since it would
have to entail resistance to or tolerance of multiple,
structurally dissimilar DNA lesions.
INTRODUCTION
The clinical inactivity of trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
(transplatin) (Figure 1A) is a paradigm for the structure–
activity relationships of platinum drugs. A structurally diverse
set of transplatin analogues exhibiting different spectra of
cytotoxicity, including activity in tumor cells resistant to
cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] (Figure 1A),
have been identified by replacement of one or both NH3
ligands (1–3). There is a large body of experimental evidence
that the success of platinum complexes in killing tumor cells
results from the formation of covalent adducts on DNA (4).
Hence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the reasons for
the enhanced pharmacological properties and activation of
bifunctional mononuclear trans-platinum(II) compounds is
that they bind to DNA in a manner fundamentally different
from that of the clinically ineffective ‘parent’ transplatin.
Cytotoxic trans-platinum(II) complexes whose DNA-
binding modes have been intensively investigated include
complexes of the general structure trans-[PtCl2(NH3)(L)],
where L ¼ planar amine such as pyridine, thiazole
(Figure 1A) or quinoline (1). To understand the mechanism
of cytotoxicity, biochemical and biophysical methods as
well as molecular modeling techniques were used to study
the modifications of natural, high molecular mass DNA
by trans-[PtCl2(NH3)(thiazole)] (trans-PtTz) (Figure 1A) or
trans-[PtCl2(NH3)(quinoline)] (trans-PtQ) (5–8). The adducts
of these compounds preferentially terminate in vitro RNA
synthesis in transcription mapping experiments at guanine
residues and at similar sites as the adducts of cisplatin (5).
DNA modified by these analogues is recognized by cisplatin-
specific antibodies but not by transplatin-specific antibodies,
suggesting that these newer analogues behave in some aspects
similar to cisplatin. Importantly, the planar ligand in all or in

a significant fraction of covalent DNA adducts of these
transplatin analogues is well positioned to interact with the
duplex, presumably through stacking interactions.
Monofunctional DNA adducts formed by trans-PtTz and
trans-PtQ are formed at a rate similar to that of trans-
platin (5). The rate of rearrangement to bifunctional adducts
is relatively slow but similar to that observed for transplatin. In
contrast to transplatin, however, the analogues with planar
ligands form considerably more interstrand cross-links
(CLs) (30–40% after 48 h) with a much shorter half-time
(t1/2) 5 h (5) [12% interstrand CL is formed by transplatin
after 48 h with t1/2 > 11 h (9)]. Further, the interstrand CLs are
formed between guanine residues at the 50-GC/50-GC sites—
formally equivalent to cisplatin but different from transplatin,
which forms these adducts between complementary guanine
and cytosine residues (9). A significant fraction of the mono-
functional adducts persist over time (30–40% after 48 h)
so that 20–40% of the total adducts are intrastrand, presum-
ably mainly 1,3 CLs (5). Thus, no one specific adduct, i.e.
monofunctional or bifunctional interstrand and intrastrand
CLs, represents a major lesion. Formation of one or all of
these adducts may be relevant to the cytotoxicity of trans-
[PtCl2(NH3)(planar amine)], meriting a detailed study of
their impact on DNA conformation and some ‘downstream’
intracellular processes, such as DNA damage recognition by
specific proteins, DNA polymerization and repair, which all
play a crucial role in the mechanism of antitumor activity
of ‘classical’ cisplatin (4).
Site-specific adducts containing one defined lesion give
more information on the structural details of ‘global’ DNA
binding. The results to date indicate that DNA conformational
changes of trans-[PtCl2(NH3)(planar amine)] are relatively
independent of the nature of the planar amine. To examine
the consequences of specific adducts containing planar amines
we have used trans-PtTz as a suitable representative as it is
water-soluble and formally exhibits antitumor, albeit moder-
ate, activity (1). Monofunctional DNA adducts of trans-PtTz,
in contrast to monodentate [PtCl(dien)]Cl or [PtCl(NH3)3]Cl,
inhibit DNA synthesis and create a local conformational
distortion similar to that produced by the 1,2-GG intrastrand
CL of cisplatin, which is considered the lesion most respons-
ible for its anticancer activity (8). In addition, trans-PtTz
monofunctional adducts are recognized by HMGB1 domain
proteins and are removed by the nucleotide excision repair
(NER) system similar to the 1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin.
This paper describes the analysis of short duplexes contain-
ing the single, site-specific interstrand and 1,3-intrastrand
CLs of trans-PtTz to obtain a more complete picture on the
DNA modifications produced by this compound. The con-
formational changes, subsequent consequences with respect
to protein recognition, DNA polymerization and repair com-
pared to cis and transplatin are highly dependent on the nature
of the adduct. The interstrand CL of trans-PtTz affects DNA
conformation and its recognition by high mobility group
(HMG) domain proteins differently from the interstrand
CLs formed by the parent transplatin, but similarly, although
in a lesser extent, as the interstrand CL of cisplatin. In addition,
the results indicate that in contrast to transplatin, trans-PtTz
forms long-lived 1,3-intrastrand CLs that distort DNA con-
formation in double-helical DNA, but are weakly repaired.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
trans-PtTz was prepared according to the previously published
methods (10). Cisplatin and transplatin were obtained from
Sigma. The stock solutions of platinum compounds were pre-
pared at the concentration of 5 · 104 M in 10 mM NaClO4
and stored at 4C in the dark. The synthetic oligodeoxyribo-
nucleotides (Figures 1B, 5C and 6) were purchased from
VBC-Genomics (Vienna, Austria) and were purified as
described previously (11). Restriction endonucleases, Klenow
fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I deficient
in 30!50 proofreading exonuclease activity (KF), and T4
polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England
Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Reverse transcriptase of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (RT HIV-1) was from
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Nonidet N P-30 was from
Fluka (Prague, Czech Republic). Acrylamide, bis(acryla-
mide), urea and NaCN were from Merck. Radioactive products
were from Amersham Biosciences. ATP was from Roche
Applied Science.
Platination of oligonucleotides
The duplexes containing single, intrastrand CL of cisplatin,
transplatin or trans-PtTz in the top strand [the duplexes in
Figure 1B that contained two guanine (G) residues in the
top strand] were prepared as described previously (8,12,13).
The interstrand cross-linked duplexes were also prepared as
described previously (7,9,14).
Gel-mobility shift assay
The 50 end labeled 20 bp oligonucleotide duplexes with blunt
ends containing the central sequences in the top strands TGCT,
TGTGT and TGGT (these duplexes were identical to TGCT,
TGTGT and TGGT duplexes shown in Figure 1B except that
overhanging nucleotides at 30 ends were paired with their
complementary nucleotides) either unplatinated (controls) or
containing the central platinum CL were used and their reac-
tion with HMG-domain proteins was performed and analyzed
as described previously (15). The electrophoresis was per-
formed for 50 min at 4C, gels were dried and visualized
by using the FUJIFILM bio-imaging analyzer and the radio-
activities associated with bands were quantified with the AIDA
image analyzer software. Competition experiments performed
to determine apparent dissociation constants, KD(app), were
performed as described previously (15). KD(app) values were
estimated in the manner described in Ref. (15). Each KD(app) is
the average of at least two measurements.
Nucleotide excision assay
The 148 bp substrates containing single, central intrastrand or
interstrand CL were assembled from three oligonucleotide
duplexes as described previously (16,17). Oligonucleotide
excision reactions were performed in cell-free extracts
(CFEs) prepared from the HeLa S3 and CHO AA8 cell lines
as described previously (18). These extracts were kindly pro-
vided by J. T. Reardon and A. Sancar (University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). In vitro repair was measured with
excision assay using these CFEs and 148 bp linear DNA
substrates (see above) as described previously (18).
Inhibition of DNA polymerization
The 30mer or 23mer templates (Figure 5) containing a single
1,3-GTG intrastrand CL of trans-PtTz or 1,2-GG intrastrand
CL of cisplatin were prepared in the same way as described
above. The 17mer or 8mer DNA primers (the sequence of the
17mer primer is shown in Figure 6) were complementary to
the 30 termini of the 23mer or 30mer templates, respectively.
The DNA substrates (1.5 · 107 M) were formed by anneal-
ing templates and 50 end-labeled primers at a molar ratio of
3:1. All experiments using RT HIV-1 were performed at
37C in a volume of 50 ml in a buffer containing 50 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 3 mM
DTT, 0.1% Nonidet N P-30, 100 mM dATP, 100 mM dCTP,
100 mM dGTP, and 100 mM TTP and 1.0 U of RT HIV-1. The
experiments with KF were performed at 25C using the same
volume, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM
DTT, 50 mM BSA/ml; the nucleoside triphosphates were at a
concentration of 25 mM and 0.5 U of KF was used. Reactions
were terminated by the addition of EDTA, so that its resulting
concentration was 20 mM, and heating at 100C for 30 s.
Products were resolved by denaturing 24% polyacrylamide
(PAA)/8 M urea gel and then visualized and quantified
by using the FUJIFILM bioimaging analyzer and AIDA
image analyzer software. Other details were published
previously (19,20).
RESULTS
Structural consequences of interstrand cross-linking
Unwinding and bending. The structural details responsible for
bending and unwinding of cisplatin and transplatin–DNA
interstrand adducts have been elucidated recently (21). There-
fore, it was of interest to compare the bending and unwinding
induced by a single, site-specific interstrand CL of trans-PtTz.
Multimers of the oligonucleotide platinated at a single site
may show strong anomalies in their electrophoretic mobilities
as a consequence of coherent addition in-phase platinum-
induced bends. The maximum anomalies are observed if
the match between the sequence repeat and the helix screw
is optimized (22). In addition, if the interplatinum distance
in these multimers is systematically varied in polymers
containing the adduct, the multimer that migrates most
slowly gives the optimal phasing for cooperative bending,
from which the degree of unwinding can be determined
(23). Thus, electrophoretic migration of the multimers formed
from the series of oligonucleotide duplexes of different
lengths, which contain a single, site-specific platinum adduct
can be evaluated in terms of a quantitative measure of the
extent of planar curvature and unwinding (13,24–26).
Oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes TGCT (20–23) (20–
23 bp long) were used for these studies. The sequences
were identical or similar to that of the duplex TGCT (21)
shown in Figure 1B; the sequence of the duplex TGCT (20)
had one marginal C·G base pair deleted, whereas one or two
additional TA base pairs were added to one or two ends in the
duplexes TGCT (22) or TGCT (23), respectively. The ligation
products of the unplatinated or CL-containing duplexes were
analyzed on native PAA electrophoresis gels (Figure 2A). The
DNA unwinding of the trans-PtTz interstrand adduct was

found to be 20 ± 2, considerably higher than that induced
by the interstrand CL of transplatin [12; (12)], but lower than
that induced by the interstrand CL of cisplatin (76–80). More-
over, the interstrand CL bends DNA by 22 ± 2 toward
the minor groove [the direction of the bend was determined
using the duplex [TGCT(A/T)5] (32) (Figure 1B) (27)]. Thus,
the bending is similar to those afforded by the interstrand
CL of cisplatin or transplatin using the same experimental
procedure [20–40 or 20, respectively (21)]. Interestingly,
in contrast to the cisplatin or transplatin interstrand CLs,
the ligation of duplexes with trans-PtTz interstrand CLs did
not result in the formation of circles, suggesting that the
flexibility of the double helix is not increased (12,28).
Chemical probes of DNA conformation. The duplex TGCT
(21) (Figure 1B) containing a single, site-specific interstrand
CL of trans-PtTz was treated with several reagents that act
as chemical probes for the existence of conformations other
than canonical B-DNA (Figure S1 in Supplementary Data),
as described previously (12). The interstrand CL induces in
DNA a distortion extending over at least 4 bp and localized
mainly at the base pairs containing the platinated G residues.
Recognition by HMG domain proteins. An important feature
of the mechanism of antitumor activity of several platinum
drugs (depending on the cell type) is that their adducts are
recognized by proteins containing HMG domains (3,29–31).
For instance, the major 1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin
and the monofunctional adducts of trans-PtTz are readily
recognized by HMGB1 domains A and B (8,32) and the
interstrand CL of cisplatin by the HMGB1 domain B (33).
In contrast, the cisplatin 1,3-GNG intrastrand CL and DNA
modified by transplatin or monodentate [PtCl(dien)]Cl or
[PtCl(NH3)3)]Cl, are not recognized by these cellular proteins
(3,29,30). The interactions of the rat HMGB1 domain A
(HMGB1a) and HMGB1 domain B (HMGB1b) with the
20 bp duplex TGCT (20) containing a single, site-specific
interstrand CL of trans-PtTz were investigated using a gel-
mobility shift assay and binding was detected by retardation
of the migration of the radiolabeled 20 bp probes through
the gel (Figure 3) (33,34). Consistent with previous reports
(15), a shifted band upon incubation of the duplex containing
1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin with both HMGB1a and
HMGB1b was observed (data not shown) indicating that
both proteins recognize the duplex containing this adduct.
The HMGB1a exhibited under the same experimental condi-
tions no binding to the 20 bp duplex when unplatinated or
containing the interstrand CL of either cisplatin [consistent
with previous results (33)] or trans-PtTz (data not shown).
The HMGB1b exhibited under the same experimental

conditions no binding to the unplatinated 20 bp duplex
(Figure 3, lanes 1–4), but a shifted band upon incubation of
the interstrand CLs of cisplatin (Figure 3A, lanes 9–12) or
trans-PtTz (Figure 3A, lanes 5–8) was clearly observed indic-
ating that the protein recognizes the duplex containing these
interstrand CLs. Thus, HMGB1b, but not HMGB1a, protein
exhibited affinity for the interstrand CL of trans-PtTz which
was similar, although somewhat less pronounced, compared
with that for the interstrand CL of cisplatin (Figure 3B).
Nucleotide excision repair. In mammalian cells, the NER
pathway is an important mechanism for the removal of
bulky, helix-distorting DNA adducts, such as those generated
by various chemotherapeutics, including cisplatin (3,35,36).
Efficient repair of 1,2-GG or 1,3-GTG intrastrand CL of cis-
platin and no excision repair of interstrand CLs of cisplatin
have been reported from various NER systems, including
human and rodent excinucleases (3,37). The results in
Figure 4A, lanes 4 and 8, demonstrating NER by the rodent
excinuclease, are consistent with these reports. The major
excision fragment contains 28 nt, and other primary excision
fragments are 23–27 nt in length. No excision products were,
however, detected for the interstrand CL of trans-PtTz under
identical conditions where the cisplatin 1,2- or 1,3-intrastrand
CLs were readily removed by both rodent and human exci-
nuclease (shown in Figure 4A, lane 12 for the CL treated with
rodent excinuclease).
Structural consequences of intrastrand CL
Steric constraints prevent the formation of transplatin intra-
strand CLs between adjacent base residues in double-helical
DNA. The trans compounds can, however, cross-link two
bases on the same strand separated by at least one interven-
ing base, forming mostly 1,3-GNG intrastrand CLs (where
N ¼ A, C, G or T).
Stability of the 1,3-GNG intrastrand CLs. The 1,3-GNG intra-
strand CL (N ¼ any nucleotide) of transplatin is stable in
single-stranded DNA under physiological conditions.
Pairing of single-stranded DNA containing this 1,3-GNG
intrastrand adduct with the complementary DNA sequences
results in rearrangement into interstrand CLs (38). The stabil-
ity of 1,3-GNG intrastrand CLs of trans-PtTz was investigated
using 20mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides (the top strands of the
duplexes CGCGC, TGCGT and TGTGT shown in Figure 5C)
that were radioactively labeled at their 50 ends and platinated
so that they contained single and central, site-specific
1,3-GCG or GTG intrastrand CLs, respectively. The single-
stranded oligonucleotides containing this CL or the cor-
responding duplexes were incubated in 0.2 M NaClO4 at
37C. At various time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn
and analyzed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing condi-
tions. Only 2–5% of these intrastrand CLs were transformed
into interstrand CLs after 24 h (Figure 5B). In contrast, 70% of
the transplatin 1,3-intrastrand CLs in the duplex TGTGT were
transformed into interstrand CLs after 24 h [Figure 5A and B
and (39)]. Further, the 1,3-GNG intrastrand adduct of trans-
PtTz in the single-stranded oligonucleotides was inert over a
long period of time (>5 days) (data not shown).
Unwinding and bending. Bending and unwinding studies of
the 1,3-intrastrand CL were performed in the oligodeoxyribo-
nucleotide duplexes TGTGT (19–22) (19–22 bp long) (12,13).
The sequences were identical or similar to that of the duplex
TGTGT (21) shown in Figure 1B; the 19 and 20 bp duplexes
had one or two marginal C·G pairs deleted, respectively,
whereas one additional T·A pair was added to one end in
the 22 bp duplex. The DNA bending toward the minor groove
and unwinding owing to one 1,3-intrastrand adduct of
trans-PtTz were measured at 40 ± 2 and 15 ± 2, respectively
[the direction of the bend was determined using the duplex
[TGTGT(A/T)5] (32) (Figure 1B) as described previously
(27)]. Moreover, the ligation of the duplexes containing
1,3-intrastrand CL of trans-PtTz did not result in the formation
of circles, suggesting that these 1,3-intrastrand CLs did not
increase the flexibility of the double helix (12,28).
Chemical probes of DNA conformation. The single, site-
specific 1,3-GTG intrastrand CL in the duplex TGTGT (21)
induces a distortion extending over at least 6 bp and is
localized mainly at the base pair between the platinated G
residues and the base pairs on its 50 side (Figure S2 in
Supplementary Data).

Recognition by HMG domain proteins. Using the same experi-
mental approach as for the trans-PtTz interstrand CL, neither
HMGB1a nor HMGB1b was found to bind the 20 bp probe
containing the intrastrand CL of trans-PtTz (data not shown).
Nucleotide excision repair. Importantly, excision repair
substrates containing the site-specific trans-PtTz 1,3-GTG
intrastrand CL were repaired by both human and rodent
excinucleases, but with a markedly lower efficiency than
the intrastrand CLs of cisplatin (shown in Figure 4A, lane 6,
and in Figure 4B and C for the adduct repaired by rodent
excinuclease).
Inhibition of DNA polymerization. DNA secondary structures
have significant effects on processivity of a number of pro-
karyotic, eukaryotic and viral DNA polymerases. The charac-
ter of DNA templates containing site-specific platinum adducts
dictate whether prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases
are blocked or can traverse through the lesion. DNA poly-
merization using the templates site-specifically modified by
trans-PtTz or cisplatin by RT HIV-1 was investigated to
reveal the potential differences in conformational alterations
imposed on DNA by these two adducts. We constructed the

(Figure 6) unplatinated or containing either the 1,3-GTG
intrastrand CL of trans-PtTz or the 1,2-GG intrastrand CL
of cisplatin, respectively. The first 17 nt on the 30 terminus
of the 30mer template strand were complementary to the
nucleotides of the 17mer primer, and the 30 guanine involved
in the 1,3-GTG CL of trans-PtTz or in 1,2-GG CL of cisplatin
on the template strand was located at its 20th position from
the 30 terminus (Figure 6). After annealing the 17 nt primer to
the 30 terminus of the unplatinated or platinated template
strand (positioning the 30 end of the primer three bases before
the adduct in the template strand), we examined DNA poly-
merization through the unique CLs on the template by
RT HIV-1 in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleoside
50-triphosphates. The reaction was stopped at various time
intervals, and the products analyzed using a sequencing gel
(Figure 6). Polymerization using the template containing the
CL of cisplatin proceeded rapidly up to the nucleotides at

and transplatin in the 20 bp duplexes into the interstand CLs. The samples
of the 20 mM duplexes TGTGT, TGCGT and CGCGC containing the single,
site-specific 1,3-intrastrand CL were incubated at 37C in 0.2 M NaClO4, 5 mM
Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mM EDTA; at various time intervals, the
aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed by electrophoresis in 12% PAA/8 M urea
gel. (A) Phosphorimage of the gel of the duplex TGTGT modified by trans-

migrating species contain the interstrand cross-linked oligonucleotides (ICLs)
whereas the bottom bands corresponding to more rapidly migrating species
contain the intrastrand cross-linked oligonucleotides (IACs). (B) Plots of the

the sites opposite the CL, such that the 20 and 21 nt products
accumulated to a significant extent (shown in Figure 6,
lanes 6–10). There was only a slight accumulation of larger
DNA intermediates, whereas no intermediate products were
seen with the 30mer control template as the full-length product
was being formed (shown in Figure 6, lanes 1–5). The full-
length products were also noticed with the 23mer template
containing the CL of cisplatin, although in a smaller amount.
The results are in agreement with previously published work
(40) using T7 DNA polymerase and RT HIV-1 and confirm
that the 1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin inhibits DNA syn-
thesis, but translesion synthesis may occur. In contrast, under
the same experimental conditions, DNA polymerization by
RT HIV-1 on the trans-PtTz 1,3-intrastrand CL template
proceeded up to the nucleotide at the site opposite the 30 G
involved in the CL (Figure 6, lanes 11–15). There was almost
no accumulation of shorter and larger DNA intermediates,
and importantly, no full-length products accumulated. This
result indicates that the 1,3-GTG intrastrand CLs of trans-
PtTz impede elongation of DNA to a greater extent than the
major adducts of cisplatin (Figure 6).
The effects of the 1,3-intrastrand CL of trans-PtTz on
polymerization by KF were also examined. This enzyme
possesses template-dependent DNA polymerase activity but
relatively better processivity and fidelity (41). In these studies,
elongation of the 8mer/23mer primer–template duplexes was
tested (data not shown). The trans-PtTz 1,3-intrastrand CL
constitutes a fairly strong block to DNA synthesis catalyzed
by both DNA polymerases. The high degree of structural and
sequence conservation of the domains among eukaryotic,
prokaryotic and viral polymerases (42), suggests that the
results from studies of the RT HIV-1 and KF- should be
also applicable to other DNA polymerases (43,44). Hence,
the stronger inhibition of DNA polymerization by the
trans-PtTz 1,3-intrastrand CL reflects an important difference
in biological processes of replication or DNA repair in
comparison with the major adduct of cisplatin.
DISCUSSION
Transplatinum complexes with sterically hindered ligands
[planar N-heterocycles; iminoethers (45), aliphatic amines
(46) and aliphatic heterocycles, such as piperazine (39)] dis-
play significantly increased cytotoxicity over the ‘parent’
trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] compound. trans-PtTz is a representative
example of the structural class of cytotoxic compounds of
general formula trans-[PtCl2(L)(L
0)] containing at least one
planar amine. The planar ligand clearly has significant con-
sequences for the DNA conformational changes induced by
these molecules. It appears likely from the work published to
date that all planar ligands will have similar effects. The cyto-
toxicity of transplatinum complexes containing planar ligands
is characterized by values similar to cisplatin and the retention
of activity in cisplatin-resistant cells. A distinct profile of
cytotoxicity in the NCI tumor cell line panel is also observed
(47). It is therefore of interest to consider how the DNA bind-
ing of the various adducts summarized in Table 1 may con-
tribute to these biological properties.
Unlike ‘classical’ cisplatin or transplatin, modification of
DNA by trans-PtTz leads to monofunctional and bifunctional
intra and interstrand CLs in roughly equal proportions. The
bending of34 toward the major groove and local unwinding
of 12–13 of the monofunctional adduct are uncannily similar
to those of the 1,2-intrastrand CL of cisplatin and as a con-
sequence the lesion is susceptible to NER and recognized by
HMG-family proteins (8). Thus, other downstream biological
effects of the trans-PtTz monofunctional adduct are also likely
to be similar to those induced by cisplatin.

The steric effect of the planar ligand results in the forma-
tion of bifunctional interstrand CLs between adjacent guanines
in a 50-GC/50-GC bp. The DNA bending and unwinding are
quantitatively significantly smaller than those of the analogous
cisplatin interstrand CL. Nevertheless, similar to that adduct
but in contrast to that of transplatin, the trans-PtTz interstrand
CL is a weak substrate for HMGB1b protein recognition and is
not repaired in NER assays.
Transplatin does not form stable 1,2-intrastrand CLs in
double-helical DNA (38) and this property has been related
to its clinical inefficiency (48,49). Replacement of one
ammine by a thiazole ligand results in a distinctively enhanced
stability of the 1,3-GNG intrastrand CLs in short oligoeoxy-
ribonucleotide duplexes (Figure 5). Despite the similarity in
bending to that of the 1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin no
recognition of the trans-PtTz 1,3-intrastrand CL by HMG-
domain proteins was observed. A plausible explanation may
be that the bending owing to the trans-PtTz 1,3-intrastrand
CL is in the opposite direction than that of the 1,2-intrastrand
CL of cisplatin, thus preventing DNA bending toward the
major groove required for its accommodation in the complex
with HMGB1 protein (8,32).
Several reports have demonstrated that NER is a major
mechanism contributing to cisplatin resistance (18,37,50).
The 1,3-intrastrand CL of trans-PtTz is not removed as
readily by excision repair as the cisplatin intrastrand adducts
(Figure 4). The repercussion of stronger inhibition of DNA
polymerization by the 1,3-intrastrand CL of trans-PtTz in
comparison with the major adduct of cisplatin (Figure 6)
adds a new dimension to the impact of the activated trans
geometry in platinum compounds on biological processes,
possibly including replication or DNA repair. However, it
is not surprising that the interstrand CL of trans-PtTz is not
excised in the assays we have used. Excision repair factors,
most notably XPF-ERCC1, are involved in the interstrand
CL repair, but there are no published data describing cell
extracts proficient in the interstrand CL removal when assayed
in a way similar to that described in the present work.
The cytotoxicity profile of trans-PtTz may be reasonably
attributed to the structural consequences of DNA damage
and the variety of adducts or lack of dominance of one specific
adduct may correlate with the unusual profile seen. Thus,
while long-lived monofunctional adducts simulate the bio-
logical consequences of cisplatin, the bifunctional adducts
will induce cellular effects unique from the clinical drug.
HMG-domain proteins sensitize cells to cisplatin (32,51),
possibly owing to shielding of cisplatin–DNA adducts from
excision repair or recruitment of these proteins from their
native transcriptional regulatory function (3,15,30,51). For
the subset of trans-PtTz bifunctional adducts with weak
or no HMG binding these hypothetical pathways will not
operate. Thus, a certain proportion of adducts will circumvent
the cellular control induced for cisplatin and indeed other
DNA-damaging agents and such circumvention may be
reflected as a different cytotoxicity profile.
The multiple DNA lesions available to trans-planaramine
complexes may all contribute substantially to their cyto-
toxicity so that the overall drug cytotoxicity could be the
sum of the contributions of each of these adducts. However,
an intriguing scenario consistent with the cytotoxicity profile
different from cisplatin may be that that acquisition of drug
resistance is a relatively rare event, since it would have
to entail resistance to or tolerance of multiple, structurally
dissimilar DNA lesions.
A long-term goal of our investigations is to place the
cytotoxicity of metal-based compounds into the context of
molecular pathways leading to tumor cell death. We believe
that the significance of the results of the present work consists
in improvement of the theoretical background needed for the
design of new anticancer metal-based drugs.
