Abstract 
 
The widely-accepted disinhibition theory of the motion aftereffect (MAE) proposes 
that the balance point of an opponent mechanism is changed by directional adaptation. 
To see if the post-adaptation balance point could be predicted from contrast 
adaptation, we measured threshold-vs-contrast (i.e. T-vs-C or dipper) functions, 
before and after adaptation to moving gratings. For test stimuli moving in the same 
direction, adaptation shifted the point of maximum facilitation (i.e. the dip) upwards 
and rightwards. For tests moving in the opposite direction, adaptation produced a 
similar, but smaller, shift. These shifts are consistent with a change in divisive gain 
control. They are also consistent with subtractive inhibition followed by half-wave 
rectification. We attempted to use transducer functions derived from these data to 
predict the strength of the MAE. When combined, gratings moving in the adapted and 
opposite directions appeared perfectly balanced (i.e. counterphasing) when the latter 
was given approximately 2% more contrast than was predicted on the basis of the 
derived transducers. This small under-prediction may be indicative of sensory 
recalibration. Finally, we found that adaptation did not alter the fact that low-contrast 
stimuli could be detected and their direction identified with similar accuracy. We 
conclude that both static and dynamic forms of MAE are primarily caused by a 
decreased sensitivity in directionally-tuned mechanisms, as proposed by the 
disinhibition theory.

Introduction 
 
The motion after effect (MAE) is a phenomenal movement of physically motion-
balanced stimuli in the opposite direction to an adapting stimulus. For example, after 
adaptation to an upwards-moving grating, a flickering grating will appear to move 
downwards, even though it is composed of physically equal upwards- and 
downwards-moving components.  According to the disinhibition theory of the MAE 
(Mather, Verstraten, & Anstis, 1998; Sekuler & Pantle, 1967; Sutherland, 1961) 
detectors for downwards motion is inhibited by upwardly-tuned detectors, but after 
adaptation, the sensitivity of the latter is reduced, and the downward detectors are 
released from inhibition.  The seminal study supporting the disinhibition theory was 
carried out by Sekuler & Ganz (1963) who found a reduction in contrast sensitivity 
for gratings moving in the adapted direction, but not in the opposite direction. Their 
psychophysical experiment echoed the finding from physiology that directionally-
tuned detectors in rabbit retina lose sensitivity when subjected to prolonged 
stimulation (Barlow & Hill, 1963). 
 
One version of the disinhibition theory asserts a two-stage model, in which detectors 
tuned to opposite motion directions inhibit one another at a second stage, as they do in 
the standard Reichardt model (Hassenstein & Reichardt, 1956; Solomon, Chubb & 
Morgan, 2005; Solomon, Chubb, John & Morgan, 2005; Hassenstein & Reichardt, 
1961).  The first stage has been tentatively identified with V1, on the grounds that V1 
contains directionally-tuned neurones that also respond to flicker.  The second stage 
has been identified with V5/MT, where directional neurones are inhibited by stimuli 
moving in their null direction (Kohn & Movshon, 2003; Snowden, Treue, Erickson, & 
Andersen, 1991).  Neuroimaging studies have supported the two stage model by 
showing that the BOLD response in V5/MT to a moving stimulus is reduced by an 
oppositely-moving stimulus; while there is little evidence for this opponency effect in 
V1 (Heeger, Boynton, Demb, Seidemann, & Newsome, 1999).  
 
Compelling support for the two-stage model has come from a  recent study (Kohn & 
Movshon, 2003) of anaesthetised monkeys, showing that adaptation in the preferred 
direction of neurones in V5/MT reduces their sensitivity to the preferred direction in a 
 4 
manner consistent, in many cases, with an increase in divisive inhibition. The 
response to directionally-balanced flicker was increased by adapting to motion in the 
null direction for the cell. However, null adaptation had no effect on the spontaneous 
discharge rate. Adaptation in one half of the receptive field did not affect sensitivity in 
the other half of the receptive field, indicating that the adaptation is inherited from 
V1, in line with many studies showing strong effects of adaptation in V1 (Maffei, 
Fiorentini, & Bisti, 1973; Movshon & Lennie, 1979). 
Despite the evident success of the disinhibition theory, some facts are difficult to fit 
in.  First, there is evidence that the dynamic motion aftereffect (exemplified by a 
counterphasing grating) differs from the static effect, exemplified by the ‘waterfall 
phenomenon’ (Addams, 1834; Thompson, 1993), in which stationary contours appear 
to move in the opposite direction to an adapting stimulus. There is even evidence for 
an  MAE when testing with a homogeneous flickering test field (Green, Chilcoat, & 
Stromeyer, 1983). The existence of a static MAE does not, in itself, challenge the 
disinhibition theory (Clifford, 2002), since many direction-selective neurones in 
MT/V5 show such broad tuning for speed, that they respond to stationary stimuli 
(Lagae et al, 1993).  However, different mechanisms for the static and dynamic MAE 
are suggested by the relatively greater magnitude of the latter to non-luminance 
defined motion (Nishida & Sato, 1995) and high adaptation speeds (Nishida, Ashida, 
& Sato, 1994; Verstraten, van der Smagt, & van der Grind, 1998). It also enjoys 
complete inter-ocular transfer (Nishida, Ashida & Sato, 1994), unlike the static MAE 
(Moulden, 1980.). 
 
Other facts to consider include the absence of the MAE from full-field movement 
(Wohlgemuth, 1911; though this could be explained by vection) the asymmetry 
between the expanding and contracting MAE’s (Wohlgemuth, 1911) and one report 
that the MAE is reduced if the adapting motion is correlated with motion of the 
observer (Harris, Morgan, & Still, 1981).  These facts made us wonder if there might 
be a component of the MAE due not to loss of sensitivity, but to recalibration of the 
balance point. An analogy may be made to normalisation where, for example, 
adaptation to slightly curved lines makes straight lines appear curved in the opposite 
direction (Gibson, 1933).  One possibility is that recalibration is the main explanation 
of the static MAE, while the dynamic MAE depends both upon recalibration and 
 5 
disinhibition. Recalibration might be prevented if the observer were aware that the 
retinal movement is caused by self-motion, as argued by Harris et al (1981). Within 
this framework, a reduction in the stationary MAE from unattended adaptors (Rees, 
Frith, & Lavie, 1997) would suggest that recalibration depends on attentional 
awareness. (Although the same fact could alternatively be explained by inattention’s 
reducing the response of V1 to movement as observed by Ghandi, Heeger, & 
Boynton, 1999). 
 
The purpose of this paper is to see whether the MAE is exclusively due to a loss of 
sensitivity, or whether there is, in addition, a recalibration component to the effect. 
Recalibration could occur by re-labelling the lines coming from a population of 
velocity-tuned detectors.  For example, the output of neurones tuned to slow 
movements in the adapted direction could be re-labelled as indicating movement in 
the unadapted direction. Gilbert & Westheimer 1990, discuss recalibration in the 
context of the tilt illusion. 
 
Measurement of a single sensitivity point on a transducer function cannot be used to 
predict the balance point for counterphase gratings. In particular, the absolute 
threshold (detection) is useless in predicting supra-threshold balance points.  Our 
strategy is to measure sensitivity loss across a wide range of baseline contrasts, by 
measuring contrast discrimination functions.  In the unadapted state, these functions 
(sometimes called threshold vs contrast or T-vs-C functions) show a characteristic 
‘dipper’ shape, in which T first decreases with pedestal contrast (facilitation) and then 
enters a masking regime where it increases. (Examples are shown in our Fig. 1.) A 
generally accepted account of the ‘dipper’ is that it reflects a signal transduction 
function with an initial threshold nonlinearity, accounting for facilitation, and a 
subsequent saturation, accounting for masking.  There is also general agreement that 
the effect of adaptation to a grating of the same spatial frequency and orientation is to 
move the point of maximum facilitation of the T-vs-C function upwards and 
rightwards, with a convergence at higher (masking) contrasts (Foley & Chen, 1997; 
Ross, Speed, & Morgan, 1993). An upwards and rightwards shift can be produced by 
changing a single parameter in the transduction function, that specifying the amount 
of signal-independent divisive inhibition. 
 
 6 
If sensitivity loss were the only reason for the MAE, then we should be able to predict 
the contrasts of oppositely moving gratings for which their combination does not 
appear to drift.  Note that there will be a family of these balance points, producing 
apparently counterphasing gratings of various intensities. Having derived the full 
transducer functions from the T-vs-C measurements, we should be able to predict the 
contrast of a component moving in the adapted direction that balances any oppositely 
moving component and vice versa. 
 
 
Our strategy was therefore as follows. First we measured the T-vs-C function for a 
high temporal frequency moving grating. Then we re-determined the same function 
after adaptation to the same and opposite directions of movement. From these 
functions we derived transducers, which we used to predict the relative strengths of 
the components of a flickering grating, and thus the component contrasts at which the 
grating would appear balanced. 
 
Our logic assumes that, for a given spatial and temporal frequency, the most sensitive 
mechanism for detection is also directionally specific. To reassure ourselves further 
on this point we measured direction discrimination at contrast threshold in a 2 x 2FC 
design (Nachmias & Weber, 1975; Watson & Robson, 1981).  If the most sensitive 
mechanism for detection were also direction specific, we would expect the same 
thresholds for detection and identification. 
 
General Methods 
Apparatus and Stimuli 
Stimuli were computed with MATLAB and displayed by a Cambridge Research 
System VSG 2/3 graphics card on a Mitsubishi DiamondPro monitor (pixel resolution 
0.46 arcsec, mean luminance 37.5 cd/m2). Viewing distance was 2 m.  Two Gabor 
patches were positioned symmetrically to the left and right of the central fixation 
point at an eccentricity of 1.67 deg. Each patch consisted of a horizontal, vertically 
drifting  2 cyc/deg carrier windowed by a stationary Gaussian envelope W, where

The grating was moved in 90 deg phase steps every 20 msec, giving a drift frequency 
of 12.5 Hz.  Contrast was controlled by a look-up table with 15-bit resolution.  The 
look-up table was split into two halves of 128 entries each, controlling the left-hand 
and right-hand patch contrast respectively.  One of the patches had the reference 
contrast (the pedestal) which was constant within a block of trials; the other (the test) 
had the pedestal contrast plus the cue (ΔC). To ensure a linear relation between DAC 
voltage and luminance, the display was calibrated with the Cambridge Research 
Systems OPTICAL. The three DAC’s were individually calibrated. 
 
Psychophysics.  To determine thresholds for contrast discrimination, the procedure 
was 2 AFC (spatial). The contrast increment ΔC, which the observer had to detect, 
was varied by the QUEST procedure (Watson & Pelli, 1979 ) using the version in the 
Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997), modified to jitter the chosen contrast from trial to trial 
in the range +/- 1 dB, in order to obtain fuller sampling of the psychometric function. 
The pedestal contrast was fixed in each block of 100 trials. Data were accumulated 
over sessions to obtain an overall psychometric function, which was fit by a Weibull 
function to find the 82% correct point. A bootstrap analysis (Efron, 1979) was used to 
find 95% confidence intervals. Feedback was provided in the form of a brief tone 
after a correct response. There was no feedback for direction discrimination. 
 
Procedure 
(a) Contrast discrimination.  The stimuli on either side of the fixation point were 
identical except for their contrast. The observer’s task was to decide which 
patch had the higher contrast. The side with the higher contrast varied 
randomly over trials. The trial began when the observer pressed a button to 
indicate the decision from the previous trial. Stimulus exposure was 0.16 sec, 
preceded by a brief tone. 
(b) Adaptation. Contrast discrimination trials were run as before, but each was 
preceded by an adaptation period to two high contrast vertically-drifting  
patches in the same position as the subsequent reference and test patches. 
 8 
Apart from contrast and direction of drift, the adapting patches were identical 
to the test patch. The initial trial, and every tenth trial thereafter, was preceded 
by 30 sec of adaptation; other trials were preceded by 3 sec adaptation. 
Observers were instructed to keep their eyes fixed on the central fixation 
point during adaptation. 
(c) Direction discrimination at threshold. This was exactly the same as (a) except 
that a 2 x 2FC task was used. The observer first indicated the side of fixation 
(1 or 2) on which the target appeared, and then used the same two buttons to 
indicate whether the target moved upwards (1) or downwards (2).  The 
pedestal had zero contrast. 
(d) Direction discrimination for counterphasing gratings. Only a single patch was 
presented, randomly to the left or right of fixation and the procedure was the 
Method of Single Stimuli rather than 2 AFC. The patch contained two 
components  moving in opposite directions.  One component had a fixed 
contrast F. The contrast V, of the other component was varied by a staircase 
method. When F = V, the stimulus was physically identical to a counterphase 
flickering grating.

Contrast discrimination functions were obtained for moving stimuli and for stationary 
stimuli both before and after adaptation (see Methods).  The results are shown in Fig.

 denote the number of correct and incorrect responses, respectively. 
Maximisation was obtained using the MATLAB function FMINSEARCH.  Note that 
our procedure differs from the commonly-used method of fitting thresholds (e.g. Yu, 
Klein & Levi, 2003), in that we fit all the information available, and thus the slope of 
the psychometric function.  Predicted thresholds are those for which 
! 
pi = 0.82. 
 
When fitting the data, we allowed the parameters a, b, p and q to vary one at a time 
between adaptation conditions, with the others constrained to be the same between 
adaptation conditions. The fits obtained by varying b were  better than those obtained 
by varying any other of the parameters1. We conclude from this, and from the visual 
quality of the fits in Fig. 1, that changes in b account for most of the effects of 
adaptation.  The fits (L) where b was varied are summarised in Table 1 in the rows 
labelled ‘b’. The Table  also shows (in rows labelled ‘s’)  the best fits obtained when 
the subtractive inhibition parameter s, was allowed to vary between adaptation 
conditions, but a, b, p and q were not (s was constrained to be zero in the unadapted 
condition).  These fits appear (Fig. 1) to be very similar to those obtained by varying 
b.  Table 1 shows that, for moving test stimuli the s-fits were better than the b-fits for 
observers MM and CC, while for TM this was reversed. For Static test stimuli, the b-
                                                
1 When p was allowed to vary, the best fit was at least 22,000 times more likely (i.e. L was larger by at 
least 10) than when a, b or q was allowed to vary. 
 10 
fits were better than the s-fits for all observers. Overall, we conclude there is little to 
choose between the two models.   
 
Table 1 about here 
 
 
We conclude that the effects of adaptation are well accounted for by an increase in 
divisive inhibition (b) , in agreement with previous data for non-moving stimuli 
(Foley & Chen, 1997); and with changes in the majority of V5/MT neurones 
described by Kohn & Movshon (2003).  We cannot reject the alternative model of  
subtractive inhibition with half-wave rectification. 
 
Qualitatively, the results show that adaptation was greater when adaptor moved in the 
same rather than in opposite directions. The surprising result is the large effect of 
adapting to a moving stimulus on a stationary grating. This means either that the most 
sensitive channel for detecting a stationary grating is directly responsive to a 12.5 Hz 
adaptor; or that detectors of the latter contribute to a widely-tuned adaptation pool.   
 
EXPERIMENT 2: Direction discrimination at threshold 
The directional tuning of adaptation suggests that the most sensitive channel for 
detecting contrast increments is directionally tuned. This being the case,  
identification of direction should be as accurate as identification of position at 
threshold. We tested this with a 2 x 2 AFC design in which the observer had to make 
one response to indicate the position (left vs. right) of the stimulus and a second 
response to indicate its direction (up vs. down).  ‘Up’ trials and ‘Down’ trials were 
randomly interleaved with separate QUEST staircases for each, but contrast values 
were controlled by the accuracy of the location (detection) response only. A post-hoc 
analysis was then carried out of the psychometric function for direction identification 
and this was compared to the psychometric function for detection. Note that this 
design allows us to measure the accuracy of direction identification after adaptation. 
Although sensitivity will be much less in the adapted direction, the QUEST procedure 
will automatically raise contrast in this condition to produce the 82% level of 
detection.  We can therefore see whether direction identification accuracy is the same 
at comparable levels of detection.

Thresholds are shown numerically for 8 conditions (Adaptation State x Task x 
Direction) in Table 2 and psychometric functions for all conditions are shown 
graphically in Figure 2.

P-values are given in Table 2. As the psychometric plots (Fig. 2) suggest, the best 
evidence for a difference between detection and identification comes from TM’s 
adapted data. However, the P-value for MM’s adapted data is so high, that we might 
reasonably accept the null hypothesis that, once corrected for bias, the psychometric 
functions for identification are the same as those for detection, with the implication 
that detection was accomplished by a directionally-tuned channel.  
 
 
 
EXPERIMENT 3: Direction Discrimination with Counterphasing Gratings 
 
We determined the subjective balance point for a mixture of two component 
gratings—one moving up, the other moving down—both before and after adaptation 
to one of the components. When the two components were equal in contrast the 
 12 
stimulus was physically identical to a counterphase flickering grating, but after 
adaptation it appeared to move in the opposite direction to the adaptor. We nulled this 
effect by changing  the contrast V, of the variable component with a staircase 
procedure (see Methods). Both directions of adaptation (up, down) and direction of 
the fixed component (up, down) were used, giving 4 conditions, each of which was 
repeated at each level of the fixed component contrast at least 3 times.  Five levels of 
fixed component contrast were used, but it was not always possible to obtain data for 
all of them (for example, when the contrast was beneath threshold following 
adaptation).  
 
Results 
Interpretation of the data was complicated by a consistent bias in favour of the fixed 
component.  In control (i.e. no adaptation) conditions, the amount of bias, was found 
to vary as a power function of the contrast of the fixed component, such that a balance 
was perceived when 
 
! 
V " F = aF
p ,         (7) 
where V and F are the contrasts of the fixed and variable components, and a and p 
were free parameters. In other words, the staircases tended to converge on a point 
where the variable component was greater than the fixed. We interpret this bias as 
arising from an asymmetry in the effect of the two components. When the V was 
subthreshold, unique movement was seen in the direction of the fixed component. 
However, when V was large, the fixed component was still present, so there was 
motion energy in both directions. In general, when F > V the observer would be more 
likely to report the dominant component than they would when V > F. 
 
Biases 
! 
aF
p , fit to pre-adaptation results, were subtracted from the pre- and post-
adaptation contrasts V, which produced subjective balances with various values of F. 
These variable-component contrasts appear as red symbols in Fig 3. Finally, we 
estimated the post-adaptation contrasts V, using Equation (2) and the fits in Table 1.  
These estimates appear with the measured pre-adaptation contrasts V, both corrected 
for bias, as blue symbols in Fig. 3.  
 
 13 
If the transduced contrasts of both components were equal whenever balanced motion 
was perceived, then all the blue points should have fallen along the principal 
diagonals in Fig. 3. The fit is close, but not exact.  Instead, there is a trend for the 
adapted component to be slightly stronger than predicted by the loss of sensitivity in 
order to balance the unadapted component.  The mean discrepancy in contrast was 
.023 (2.3%) over observers and conditions. The discrepancies for MM, TM and CC 
were .035, .018, and .016 respectively. 
 
Figs 3 about here 
 
It might be argued that the discrepancy results from inaccuracies in the fits of the T-
vs-C functions in Fig. 1, which were obtained with only the b parameter varying 
across adaptation conditions. To obtain more accurate fits, we allowed all 4 
parameters of the transducer to vary between conditions, and repeated the prediction 
of the motion-balance data. The discrepancy remained, with a very similar pattern 
across observers and conditions.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Our findings are relevant to a number of issues, which we discuss in turn. 
 
Adaptation and the T-vs-C function.   
Our findings are consistent with previous investigations of the effects of adaptation on 
static stimuli (Foley & Chen, 1997), and with single-cell recordings of MT/V5 (Kohn 
& Movshon, 2003).  Adaptation causes an increase in divisive inhibition or 
subtractive inhibition (or both) , which moves the T-vs-C function upwards and 
rightwards. As others have noted (Ross, Speed & Morgan, 1993) this settles the 
question whether adaptation can improve sensitivity by moving the operating range of 
the detector. There is a range of pedestal contrasts where this occurs (see Fig. 1), but 
equally there is a range where adaptation reduces sensitivity to contrast change. In the 
masking part of the T vs. C function there is little effect of adaptation. 
 
 
 14 
A new finding in our experiments is that cross-adaptation (adapt to one direction, test 
in the opposite direction) also results in a change of divisive inhibition. This differs 
from results in the orientation domain, where cross-adaptation has more complicated 
effects, involving several parameters of the transduction function (Foley & Chen, 
1997). It also differs from Kohn & Movshon’s (2003) report that null adaptation has 
no effect on the sensitivity of MT/V5 neurones. It may be that directional tuning to 
the high temporal frequency (12.5 Hz)  used in our experiments is comparatively 
weak, resulting in direct adaptation to both directions of movement. Broad tuning 
would also explain the effects of directional adaptation on static gratings. 
 
Do changes in sensitivity cause  the dynamic motion after-effect?   
The logic behind our prediction of the balance point for a counterphase grating 
depends on the following four assumptions: 
I. The combination of two oppositely moving components will appear to move 
in the direction of the component producing the stronger neural signal. 
II. If the two components produce signals having equal strength, then the 
observer will select the two directions with equal probability. 
III. The component producing the stronger signal when presented alone will also 
produce the stronger signal when combined with the other component. 
IV. If the two components produce signals having equal strength when presented 
alone, then they will also produce signals having equal strength when they are 
combined. 
This last assumption does not imply that the signals are just as strong when the 
components are combined as they are when the components are presented separately.  
Mutual masking may well occur. We merely assume that equally strong signals mask 
each other with equal strength.  
 
T-vs-C measurements allowed us to predict 98% of the adapted component contrast 
producing a subjective balance. Although relatively meagre, the remaining 2% could  
be taken as evidence for recalibration. An alternative possibility is that one of the 
assumptions listed above is not exactly correct. It would be desirable to repeat our 
experiment over a wider range of temporal frequencies and adapting contrasts before 
concluding that there really is recalibration.  For now, we can at least conclude that if 
recalibration exists, it is small. 
 15 
 
 
What explains the static Motion after-effect? 
The motion aftereffect is seen with retinally-stabilised images (Sekuler & Ganz, 
1963), which argues that image motion is not required. However, this does not rule 
out the possibility that directionally-tuned mechanisms are stimulated by additive 
sensory noise, even when the stimulus is stationary.  We found that the detection 
thresholds for stationary stimuli were raised by adaptation to a moving stimulus, 
consistent with detection of the stationary stimulus by directionally tuned 
mechanisms. Further, we saw a clear motion aftereffect in  these stationary stimuli 
after adaptation, consistent with activation of motion-labelled lines. We therefore 
suggest that there are no labelled lines for static stimuli, and that stimuli are seen as 
stationary by a population code over directionally-tuned detectors, many of which are 
tuned to low speeds. Adaptation to a high temporal frequency moving stimulus 
reduces the sensitivity of  detectors tuned to that direction of motion, by the 
mechanism of divisive inhibition, and shifts the peak (or the centroid) of the 
population response towards the opposite direction.  We therefore agree with those 
(Nishida & Sato, 1995; Verstraten et al., 1998) who have suggested different 
mechanisms for the static and dynamic MAE’s.  The dynamic effect is a direct 
consequence of disinhibition in the mechanism tuned to the velocity of the adaptor. 
The static  effect, on the other hand, is mediated by mechanisms tuned to much lower 
speeds than the adaptor, and depends on a shift in the population response.  Our 
interpretation is consistent with the observation that the static MAE is considerably 
slower than the dynamic (Verstraten et al., 1998)

Fig.1:  Threshold vs. Contrast functions from Experiment 1. The horizontal axis 
shows pedestal contrast, and the vertical axis the corresponding contrast 
increment threshold. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals.  Results for 
different observers (MM, CC, TM) are in different columns.  The top row 
shows results obtained when the test stimulus was moving. Circles, results 
before adaptation; Triangles, results after adaptation to motion in opposite 
direction to target; Squares, results after adaptation to same direction.  
Triangles have been moved vertically by 1 log unit  and squares by two log 
units for legibility; in reality the results for all three conditions converge at 
high pedestal contrasts.  Row 2 shows results obtained when the test was 
static. Circles, results before  adaptation; Squares, results after adaptation.  
The continuous curves in (A) show fits obtained by allowing the divisive 
inhibition parameter of the Foley (1994) model to vary as a function of 
adaptation condition.  The bottom two rows (B) show exactly the same data as 
the top two, but the continous curves were obtained by allowing a subtractive 
inhibition parameter to vary as a function of adaptation condition. 
 
Fig. 2Weibull functions, maximum-likelihood fit to detection (black) and 
identification (red) results with targets moving in the adapted (solid) and null 
(dashed) directions. (NB: ceilings pegged at 0.99; detection floors pegged at 
0.5; for identification, adapted and null floors constrained to sum to 1.)  
 
Fig. 3 Each point represents the contrast of the adapted component (vertical axis) at a 
given value of the unadapted component (horizontal axis) at the point where 
the two components cancel. Square symbols are  contrast values transformed 
to get rid of  directional bias. Circles  are further transformed for sensitivity 
following adaptation, using Equation I and the parameter values in Table 1.  
Data are averaged over direction of adaptation (up and down). For further 
explanation see the text.
