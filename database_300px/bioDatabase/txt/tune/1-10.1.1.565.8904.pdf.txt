ABSTRACT
Cleavage factor Im is an essential component of the
pre-messenger RNA 3’-end processing machinery in
higher eukaryotes, participating in both the poly-
adenylation and cleavage steps. Cleavage factor Im
is an oligomer composed of a small 25 kDa subunit
(CF Im25) and a variable larger subunit of either 59,
68 or 72 kDa. The small subunit also interacts with
RNA, poly(A) polymerase, and the nuclear poly(A)-
binding protein. These protein–protein interactions
are thought to be facilitated by the Nudix domain of
CF Im25, a hydrolase motif with a characteristic a/b/a
fold and a conserved catalytic sequence or Nudix
box. We present here the crystal structures
of human CF Im25 in its free and diadenosine
tetraphosphate (Ap4A) bound forms at 1.85 and
1.80 A˚, respectively. CF Im25 crystallizes as a dimer
and presents the classical Nudix fold. Results from
crystallographic and biochemical experiments sug-
gest that CF Im25 makes use of its Nudix fold to bind
but not hydrolyze ATP and Ap4A. The complex and
apo protein structures provide insight into the active
oligomeric state of CF Im and suggest a possible
role of nucleotide binding in either the polyadenyla-
tion and/or cleavage steps of pre-messenger RNA
3’-end processing.
INTRODUCTION
Pre-messenger RNA 30-end processing in eukaryotes is a
two-step reaction consisting of endonucleolytic cleavage
of the pre-mRNA followed by addition of a poly(A) tail
at the 30 end of the upstream cleavage product (1–3).
The coupling of these processing reactions relies on
multiple protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions.
The factors that are necessary and suﬃcient to recon-
stitute cleavage and polyadenylation in a mammalian
in vitro system are poly(A) polymerase (PAP), cleavage
and polyadenylation speciﬁcity factor (CPSF), cleavage
stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage factor Im (CF Im),
cleavage factor IIm (CF IIm) and the nuclear poly(A)-
binding protein 1 (PABPN1). The recruitment of the
mammalian polyadenylation machinery to the pre-mRNA
relies on the recognition of conserved sequence elements,
such as the highly conserved hexamer AAUAAA recog-
nized by CPSF and a U-rich sequence downstream of the
cleavage site recognized by CstF. Additionally a set of
UGUA elements, a third sequence element found
upstream of the cleavage site and not as universally
conserved, is recognized by CF Im (4,5). Upon completion
of the processing steps the mRNA can be eﬃciently
transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm.
Homologs of CF I subunits are also found in cDNA data-
bases of Caenorabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster
and plants.
CF Im is an oligomer composed of a small 25 kDa
subunit (CF Im25, also referred to as CPSF5 or NUDT21)
and a larger subunit of either 59, 68 or 72 kDa (6). The
three larger subunits share substantial sequence homol-
ogy. They are encoded on two diﬀerent genes and the
72 kDa subunit is a splice variant of the 68 kDa polypep-
tide. CF Im can be reconstituted in vitro from the 25- and
68 kDa subunits (6). CF Im, in addition to having a role in
regulation of poly(A) site recognition, is also involved in
stabilizing CPSF at the conserved hexamer, enhances the
rate of poly (A) site cleavage in vitro, and has been shown
to interact with PAP and PABPN1 via its 25 kDa sub-
unit (7). Furthermore CF Im also interacts with splicing
factors, indicating a role in communicating between
diﬀerent RNA-processing complexes (8).

has been investigated biochemically. Structural character-
ization of individual and multicomponent processing
factors will elucidate the domain interactions important
for the 30 pre-mRNA processing mechanism that cannot
be deciphered by biochemical means. The structure of the
25 kDa subunit of CF Im (CF Im25) will help further deﬁne
the domains important for substrate and protein
interactions.
The structure of CF Im25 will also allow us to inves-
tigate the function of a Nudix domain present in this
protein. The ﬁrst Nudix protein to be characterized
enzymatically and structurally was Escherichia coli MutT
(9). Nudix proteins are generally characterized as house-
keeping enzymes due to their role in hydrolysis of
substrates described as nucleoside diphosphate linked to
another moiety X, many of which are potentially toxic
molecules (10,11). Nudix proteins have a conserved Nudix
fold consisting of an a/b/a sandwich. Within the Nudix
fold the consensus sequence of the Nudix box is
GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U is a hydrophobic
residue and X is any residue, and folds into a loop–a
helix–loop structure (9). Interestingly, the Nudix box in
CF Im25 lacks two of the four conserved glutamate resi-
dues, three of which were shown to be important for
catalysis (Figure 1) (12).
In this study we present the crystal structure of
human CF Im25 alone and in complex with diadenosine
tetraphosphate (Ap4A). CF Im25 crystallizes as a dimer,
which is also the oligomeric state of the protein in
solution. The CF Im25 structure presents the classic Nudix
a/b/a fold and harbors residues outside of the Nudix core
that could potentiate ligand binding. Structural and
biochemical evidence suggests that CF Im25 binds, but
does not hydrolyze, mono and di-adenosine nucleotides.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein purification
The construction of the plasmid expressing the 25 kDa
subunit of human cleavage factor Im (CF Im) with an
N-terminal 6xHis tag was previously described (7).
The cDNA of CF Im25 was subsequently cloned into a
Gateway vector with a dual 6xHis-maltose binding
protein (MBP) aﬃnity tag provided by Dr David
S. Waugh (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD)
(13). The following primers were used in the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR): 50-GAG AAC CTG TAC TTC
CAG GGT ATG TCT GTG GTA CCG CCC-30, 50-GGG
GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTT ATT
AGT TGT AAA TAA AAT TGA A-30 and 50-GGGG
ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA GCA GGC TCG
GAG AAC CTG TAC TTC CAG-30. CF Im25 (227 amino
acids) was then expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells
(Novagen) and grown in LB medium for 24 h at 258C
following induction with 0.4mM IPTG. The protein
was puriﬁed on Nickel NTA beads (Qiagen), followed
by a Tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease cleavage step,
and cation exchange on a Resource S column (GE
Healthcare): Cells were lysed at 48C by sonication in a
buﬀer containing 20mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 200mM NaCl,
and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). The lysate was
centrifuged at 12 000 g and incubated with Ni-NTA
beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 48C. Protein was eluted with lysis
buﬀer containing 100–500mM imidazole. Pooled frac-
tions were dialyzed into 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20mM Tris–
HCl pH 7.5 and 50mM KCl. CF Im25 was cleaved from
the MBP tag by the addition of equimolar amounts of Tev
protease. MBP and Tev were then separated from CF
Im25 by elution with a 50mM–1M KCl gradient at pH 7.5
on a Resource S column (GE Healthcare). The seleno-
methionyl protein was produced by inhibiting methionine
biosynthesis in E. coli (14) and puriﬁed as described
earlier. Proteins were concentrated to about 6–20mg/ml
(Millipore Amicon Ultra-15), ﬂash frozen and stored
at 808C.
Crystallization
CF Im25 crystals were initially obtained with the sitting
drop method in a 96-well tray format. Sitting drops were
set up with a 925 PC Workstation (Gilson) by mixing

sequence. The abbreviations are deﬁned as: PPHase for pyrophosphohydrolase and PPase for pyrophosphatase.

and equilibrated against 160 ml reservoir buﬀer.
Subsequently, crystals were obtained by streak seeding
hanging drops with a protein concentration of 6mg/ml.
Hanging drops were set up by mixing 1 ml of protein with
1 ml of reservoir solution under the same crystallization
conditions. Trigonal crystals grew to a maximum length of
200mm in space group P3121 (P3221) with unit cell
parameters a= b=80.11 A˚, c=72.21 A˚ and g=1208.
There is one molecule per asymmetric unit with an
estimated solvent content of 52%. Crystals of the complex
with Ap4A were obtained with the hanging drop method.
The hanging drops were set up manually by mixing 1 ml of
protein with 1 ml of reservoir solution (25% w/v PEG
3350, 0.025M MgCl2, 0.1M Tris–HCl pH 7.5). The drops
were streak seeded after a 24 h incubation period. When
the crystals reached at least 100 mm, Ap4A at a ﬁnal
concentration of 44mM was added directly to the drop.
After 6 h the soaked Ap4A crystals were cryoprotected by
the addition of 1 ml of 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 50% (v/v)
glycerol to the 2 ml hanging drop prior to ﬂash cooling in
liquid nitrogen.
Crystallographic data collection
Multiple wavelength anomalous diﬀraction (MAD) data
were collected at beamline 23-ID-D (Advanced Photon
Source at Argonne National Laboratory) on a MAR
m300 CCD detector. One complete selenomethionyl
MAD dataset was collected on one crystal at the peak,
inﬂection and high-energy remote wavelengths to a
maximum resolution of 1.85 A˚. Data were collected at
1.80 A˚ resolution on the Ap4A complex at beamline X12B
(National Synchrotron Light Source) on a Quantum-4
CCD (ADSC) detector. The data from three Ap4A-soaked
crystals were merged to increase redundancy. Diﬀraction
data were processed and scaled with DENZO and
SCALEPACK (15). Data collection statistics are summar-
ized in Table 1.

missing). AutoSHARP (17) was then used for reﬁnement
of the selenium parameters. The space group was judged
to be P3121 and not the enantiomorphic P3221, based on
the map quality and continuity. The phasing information
was then used in RESOLVE (18) for density modiﬁcation
and iterative model building. Seventy percent of the model
was built by RESOLVE. The remaining residues were
built manually using the program COOT (19). Residues
1–20 and 132–135 were omitted from the model because of
poorly deﬁned density.
Iterative rounds of reﬁnement including simulated
annealing, energy minimization, and B-factor reﬁnement
were done with CNS (20). Each reﬁnement round was
followed by rebuilding in COOT. A composite simulated
annealing omit map was generated in CNS to validate the
model and build the remaining side chains. Water
molecules were added with CNS and COOT. The quality
of the model was evaluated with PROCHECK (21). All
non-glycine residues fall within either the most favored or
additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.
The reﬁned model of the unliganded protein provided
phases to calculate an isomorphous diﬀerence Fourier
(Fo–Fo) map between the unliganded protein and the
complex with Ap4A (22). The Rcross on amplitudes
between the two datasets is 0.149, indicating good
isomorphism between the two crystals. The resulting
map showed clear density for one adenine base and
three phosphates of Ap4A. The complex with Ap4A was
reﬁned with CNS (20). The reﬁnement statistics for both
structures are reported in Table 1. Figures were drawn
with PyMOL (23).
Oligomeric state determination
Size exclusion chromatography was performed with a
Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The protein sample
or molecular mass standards were applied to the Superdex
75 column and eluted with 10% glycerol, 20mM Tris
pH 7.5 and 50mM KCl. Standard proteins (Sigma) were:
lysozyme (MW 14.4 kDa), egg albumin (45 kDa), bovine
serum albumin (67 kDa) and the void volume was
determined with blue dextran (GE Healthcare). Dynamic
light scattering was also used to conﬁrm the oligomeric
state of CF Im25 (Dynapro, Wyatt). The buried surface
area (2800 A˚2) was calculated with AREAIMOL (24) and
with CNS (20) (2700 A˚2).
Hydrolase activity assay
The standard reaction mixture contained 50mM Tris–
HCl, pH 7.5 or 8.5, 50mM KCl, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM
DTT, 20 mM CF Im25, 2 U calf intestinal phosphatase
(New England Biolabs) or 1 U S. cerevisiae pyrophos-
phatase (Sigma), and 2 or 4mM substrate in a total
volume of 50 ml. The putative substrates tested for CF
Im25 hydrolase activity include ATP, Ap4A (Sigma) and
m7G (50)ppp(50)G cap structure analog (New England
Biolabs). The reactants were combined at 48C then
incubated at 258C for 30 and 60min. The reaction was
terminated by the addition of 250 ml of 20mM EDTA and
the liberated orthophosphate was determined by the
colorimetric assay of Ames and Dubin (9,25). The limit
of detection of this assay is 5 mM of orthophosphate.
Fluorescence measurements
Steady-state tryptophan ﬂuorescence was measured
with a Quantamaster ﬂuorimeter (Photon Technology
International, South Brunswick, NJ) as described (26)
with a WG320 cut-oﬀ emission ﬁlter. CF Im25 contains
four tryptophans and only three are built in the structure:
Trp148 and Trp149 are within 10–15 A˚ of the active site
and Trp139 is located within 20 A˚ of the active site. The
fourth tryptophan, Trp13, is located in the disordered
portion of the amino terminus. The tryptophan emission
spectrum was measured by excitation of the samples at
295 nm and collecting the emitted ﬂuorescence at 908 to
the incident light over the range 300–400 nm. The slit
widths were set at a resolution of 1 nm for excitation and
4 nm for emission. Fluorescence measurements of all
protein samples were performed using a microcuvettte
with a magnetic stir bar in 20mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5,
50mM KCl and 25mM MgCl2 at 258C for the protein
alone and in the presence of increasing amounts of
nucleotide. All ﬂuorescence measurements were corrected
for Raman scatter and background ﬂuorescence and
represent experiments performed in triplicate and then
normalized and averaged. The ATP ﬂuorescence data
were ﬁt with a single hyperbola [y= ax/(b+ x)] with a Kd
of 1.53 0.18mM (1.17–1.89mM at 95% conﬁdence
interval). The Ap4A data were ﬁtted with a single
hyperbola [y= ax/(b+ x)] with a Kd of 2.44 0.49 mM
(1.46–3.43 mM at 95% conﬁdence interval).
RESULTS
Crystal structure of human CF Im25
The original N-terminal His-tagged plasmid of human CF
Im25 (7) did not express to high enough levels for
structural studies. We therefore inserted the coding
sequence of CF Im25 into a dual HisMBP vector (13).
With the resulting expression vector, 1.5mg of protein
could be puriﬁed from 1 l of culture. The structure was
solved to a resolution of 1.85 A˚ by multiple wavelength
anomalous diﬀraction of the selenomethionyl protein
variant. Residues 21–131 and 136–227 are visible in the
electron density map. A complex with Ap4A was also
obtained and reﬁned to a resolution of 1.80 A˚.
Description of the structure
Human CF Im25 is composed of 227 residues, with a cal-
culated molecular weight of 26 kDa. CF Im25 elutes as a
dimer in gel exclusion chromatography with an apparent
molecular weight of 53 kDa (Supplementary Figure).
The dimeric state of CF Im25 has also been conﬁrmed by
dynamic light scattering. In the crystal structure, dimer
formation relates two monomers by a 2-fold crystal-
lographic axis. The Nudix domain is located in the middle
of the protein and spans residues 77–202 (Figure 2). The
Nudix fold comprises two mixed b sheets ﬂanked by two
helices (a2 and a3). The Nudix box is located in helix a2

(residues 109–131) and the preceding loop. The region
immediately preceding the Nudix domain (residues 21–76)
folds into two distinct segments: residues 21–32 form an
extended loop structure that projects away from the
globular domain of the protein (residues 1–20 are not
visible in the electron density map). The extended loop is
stabilized via crystal-packing interactions with a
symmetry-related monomer and this region, which has
been shown to participate in RNA binding, is likely to
adopt a diﬀerent fold in vivo (7). Lys23 has previously
been shown to undergo acetylation, a modiﬁcation which
modulates the interaction of CF Im25 with PAP (27). The
second segment of the N-terminal region (residues 33–76)
contributes two short b strands and a long helix. Within
this region an additional modiﬁcation, this time phos-
phorylation, was reported for Tyr40 (28). We do not see
either modiﬁcation because the protein was expressed in
E. coli. The C-terminal region (residues 203–227) is
composed of two helices (a4 and a5) and a short beta
strand (b10) comprising the ﬁnal four residues.
Structural homologs of CF Im25 were searched with the
DALI server (29) and signiﬁcant structural homology was
found, but only with other Nudix proteins, including
Deinococcus radiodurans DR1025 [Z score=11.2, PDB
ID code 1SJY; (12)], Ap4A hydrolase [Z score=10.0,
PDB ID code 1KT9; (30)], ADP ribose pyrophosphatase
[Z score=9.3; PDB ID code 1V8M; (31)] and the mRNA
decapping enzyme DCP2P [Z score=9.0; PDB ID code
2A6T; (32)]. The highest Z-score (33.6 with associated
rmsd of 0.6 A˚) was actually that of another crystal
structure of CF Im25 for which coordinates were deposited
but had no publication associated with it (Structural
Genomics Consortium, Karolinska Institute; PDB ID
code 2CL3).
Dimer interactions
Dimer formation buries an interface of about 2700 A˚2
(20,24). The buried surface is extensive and represents
13% of the surface of the homodimer. The dimer interface
is maintained by approximately 20 residues per monomer,
which participate in both hydrogen bonding and non-
polar contacts. The monomer interactions are facilitated
by the amino terminal extension (residues 21–32) and by
helix a5, the loop preceding helix a5, helix a6, beta strand
b6, the loop linking b6 and b7 and beta strand b10.
The main hydrogen-bonding contributions are between
the amino terminal extension, beta strand b6 and beta
strand b10. These involve residues Thr32 of chain A and
Asp142 of chain B, Ser220 of chain A and Asn147 of chain
B as well as the reverse monomer interactions. The loop
preceding helix a5 and the loop between b6 and b7
contribute to dimer formation through hydrophobic
contacts involving residues Pro159 and Tyr160 from
chain A and Tyr202 and Phe199 from chain B.
Additional interactions are provided by stacking helix a5
from one monomer on to strand b6 of the opposing
monomer in a tail-to-tail fashion allowing hydrogen
bonding between residues in the loop following helix a5.
These hydrogen-bonding interactions include Arg221 and
its symmetry mate and the carboxyl group of Ser220 with
Asn147 from the opposing monomers.
Metal binding
CF Im25 is missing the second and fourth conserved glu-
tamates of the Nudix box (residues 124 and 128), which
are replaced by a leucine and isoleucine, respectively.
These glutamate residues are very often involved in metal
binding (12). We therefore set out to investigate whether
CF Im25 was still capable of binding metal via the two
remaining carboxylates. Although the CF Im25 crystals
were obtained in the presence of 200mM MgCl2, there
was no identiﬁable Mg2+ bound in the electron density
map. Magnesium is a light atom, which is usually not
easily identiﬁable in electron density maps and can often
be mistaken for a water molecule. We therefore used
metals that are more electron dense such as MnCl2 and
GdCl3 to identify putative metal site(s) (33). Mn
2+ and
Gd3+ present the added advantage that they are
anomalous scattering atoms, which should allow unam-
biguous identiﬁcation of metal sites. We were unable to
identify binding of either metal, regardless of whether the
metal was co-crystallized or soaked into pre-existing
crystals. Since Nudix enzymes require a divalent cation
for catalysis (9), these experiments suggested that it
is unlikely that CF Im25 functions as a hydrolase. This
ﬁnding called for further investigation of CF Im25’s bind-
ing to potential substrates (see below).
Enzymatic assays and substrate binding
We next set out to investigate whether CF Im25 binds a
substrate. We used three diﬀerent methods: a colorimetric

secondary structure numbering is based on a DSSP analysis (45).

assay to measure the release of inorganic phosphate (25),
co-crystallization/crystal soaking with putative substrates
and steady-state tryptophan ﬂuorescence experiments.
A colorimetric assay to measure the release of inorganic
phosphate, and thus the potential hydrolytic activity
of CF Im25 on nucleotides, was performed (25). The fol-
lowing putative substrates were tested: ATP, Ap4A and
the 7mG(50)ppp(50)G cap analog. Ap4A was chosen
because the two enzymes found to be most structurally
similar to CF Im25 bind Ap4A (12,30). ATP and the cap
analog were tested because of their prominent role in
RNA processing. The assay indicated that, within the
limits of detection of the assay, none of the putative
substrates tested were hydrolyzed.
Although CF Im25 does not seem to possess a hydro-
lytic activity, it could still bind nucleotides. Several
putative ligands were either co-crystallized or soaked
into the crystals: ATP, GTP, ADP, GDP, diadenosine
triphosphate (Ap3A), Ap4A, AMP, 7mG(5
0)ppp(50)G cap
analog, NAD+ and GDP-mannose. In addition to testing
these nucleotides, which are known substrates for Nudix
enzymes, we also attempted to co-crystallize CF Im25 with
a 21mer RNA derived from the PAP g cDNA sequence
(4,5). Of all the putative ligands tested, only Ap4A bound
to the crystal (see later). The original crystallization
conditions contained 200mM MgCl2 and 25% (w/v)
polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350. Because nucleotides can
precipitate in the presence of high concentrations of PEG
and magnesium (34), care was taken to modify the
crystallization conditions so as to decrease or completely
eliminate MgCl2 and therefore lessen the risk of the
nucleotide precipitating out of solution. Conditions with
NaCl or even no salt could be used in lieu of MgCl2 to
grow unliganded crystals. Even when the divalent cation
was omitted from the crystallization solution crystals did
not form with any of the ligands tested (with the notable
exception of Ap4A), demonstrating that the lack of
binding was not due to the nucleotide falling out of
solution.
Binding studies were then performed employing the
intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence properties of CF Im25.
The following Nudix ligands were tested: ATP, GTP,
Ap4A, inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), 7mG(5
0)ppp(50)G
cap analog, ADP and AMP. Dissociation constants (Kd)
measured by titrating the ligand concentration were
estimated for ATP and Ap4A (Figure 3A and B,
respectively). The ATP data were ﬁt with a single
hyperbola curve, indicating one binding aﬃnity with a
Kd value of 1.53 0.18mM. The Ap4A-binding data were
ﬁt to a single hyperbola curve and represent one binding
site per monomer, resulting in a Kd of 2.44 0.49mM.
Complex of CF Im25 with Ap4A
Co-crystallization experiments were performed in order to
resolve the ligand-binding interactions of CF Im25. Of all
the molecules screened only Ap4A was captured in a
co-crystal (Figure 4A). The Ap4A co-crystal structure was
determined by using the phases from the unliganded
structure. The resulting unbiased isomorphous diﬀerence
Fourier (Fo–Fo) map revealed distinct density for one of
the adenine bases and three of the four phosphates of
Ap4A, in the cavity of CF Im25 (Figure 4B). The rmsd
between the bound and apo structures is low (0.41 A˚),
indicating that only very small changes take place upon
substrate binding (20). The binding site residues Arg63,
Arg150, Gln157 and Lys172 are found outside of the
Nudix box region, within 3 A˚ of the triphosphate moiety,
and are involved in coordinating the triphosphate moiety
(Figure 4B). The binding site is composed of residues from
helix a1, beta strand b6, the loop linking b6 and b7 and
beta strand b7. In CF Im25, Arg63 and Arg150 are highly
conserved across species while Gln157 and Lys172 are
moderately conserved. The majority of hydrogen-bonding
interactions with Ap4A involve the oxygens of the b- and g
phosphates. The ordered adenine base of the Ap4A
molecule stacks with Phe103, a residue contained within
the Nudix domain. We note that the position of the g
phosphate of Ap4A coincides with the position of a
sulfate ion reported for CF Im25 (Structural Genomics
Consortium, Karolinska Institute; PDB ID code 2J8Q).
CF Im25 has a core structure similar to that of the
D. radiodurans Nudix protein DR1025 (12) (PDB ID code
1SU2) (Figure 5). Variations between these two structures
arise from an extension in the loop linking b6 and b7, a
shortening of the loop following b4 and an additional
a-helix (helix a1) in the CF Im25 structure. The addi-
tional a-helix in CF Im25 plays a role in sequestering the

substrate binding pocket from solvent exposure. When
comparing the positions of the bound nucleotides between
CF Im25 and DR1025 we also see variations in substrate
ﬁt. Superposition of the ATP bound in DR1025 on to the
CF Im25 structure shows that both the base and phos-
phate tail would clash with protein residues in helix a1 and
beta strand b5 in the CF Im25 structure (Figure 6).
Commonly, variations in the nucleotide-binding region of
Nudix proteins occur due to diﬀerences in the side chains
and motifs and contribute to the substrate speciﬁcity of
the Nudix protein. Interestingly, both DR1025 and CF
Im25 stabilize the adenine base via stacking interactions
with a phenylalanine residue found outside of the
Nudix box region. Base-stacking interactions via a Tyr
or Phe located 17 amino acids downstream of the
Nudix box is commonly found in all of the Nudix Ap4A
hydrolases, including DR1025 (11). Phe103 stabilizes the
adenine base in the Ap4A bound CF Im25 structure but is
located six residues upstream of the Nudix box region.
Electrostatic surface and putative RNA and
protein-binding regions
The electrostatic surface potential of CF Im25 was calcul-
ated with GRASP (Figure 7A) (35). The amino terminal
region and residues 78–160 of the Nudix domain were
shown to participate in RNA binding (7). We observe a
good correlation between the location of the putative
RNA binding residues and that of the positively charged
residues on the surface of the protein (Figure 7B).
DISCUSSION
In our crystal structure CF Im25 is a homodimer. A
dimeric state for CF Im25 is consistent with dynamic light
scattering (DLS) and gel ﬁltration experiments performed
with the 25 kDa subunit both unliganded and with ATP or
Ap4A. The dimeric structure of CF Im25 suggests that the
active form of CF Im may be a heterotrimer composed of a
CF Im25 homodimer and either the 59, 68 or 72 kDa sub-
unit. This is consistent with interaction studies in C. elegans
(DIP interaction database accession DIP:25083N) where
the CF Im25 homolog (Uniprot accession Q93716) was

found to interact with itself and with the CF Im68 homolog
(Uniprot accession Q18937). Alternatively, the complex
with the larger subunit of CF Im could be a heterotetramer.
A third possibility is that CF Im25 monomerizes upon
binding the larger subunit.
The Nudix box of CF Im25 lacks two of the four
glutamates important for catalytic function and metal
binding. Our structural and biochemical characterization
suggests that CF Im25 is able to bind but not hydrolyze
nucleotide substrates. In the dinucleotide bound CF Im25
structure, the dinucleotide is found outside of the
Nudix box and lies deeper within the active site compared
to ATP in DR1025. The ﬂuorescence-binding data for CF
Im25, indicate a binding aﬃnity in the low micromolar
range for Ap4A indicative of a potential role as a signaling
molecule and a weak, albeit physiologically relevant,
binding aﬃnity for ATP. Even though CF Im25 binds
both Ap4A and ATP, we have so far only been able to
obtain a co-crystal complex with Ap4A. It is entirely
possible that the crystallization conditions we have
explored to date for the protein–ATP complex are not
compatible with the formation of a crystal lattice and that
further exploration of the crystallization space might yield
the desired conditions. We note that pre-formed crystals
of CF Im25 dissolve upon addition of ATP, indicating a
possible conformation change upon binding of the
nucleotide.
To our knowledge, CF Im25 is the ﬁrst example of a
Nudix protein binding and not hydrolyzing a nucleotide
substrate. This loss of function/gain of a regulatory role is
not unprecedented in evolution. A similar loss of function
was reported for the Lactobacillus lactis ATP phospho-
ribosyl transferase (ATP-PRT) regulatory subunit, His Z
(36). ATP-PRT functions to initiate the biosynthesis of
histidine and requires both the HisZ subunit and HisG,
the catalytic subunit, for activity. The regulatory subunit,
HisZ, resembles the catalytic domain of functional
histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS) and utilizes its fold,
not for catalysis, but for binding of histidine to monitor
histidine levels. Although there were no metals evident in
either the free or bound structures of CF Im25 and no
identiﬁable hydrolytic activity in our colorimetric assay it
remains possible that the Nudix box of CF Im25 could
potentiate hydrolysis of Ap4A and ATP upon interaction
of CF Im25 with one of the larger CF Im subunits or
additional binding partners.
Ap4A belongs to the family of diadenosine oligophos-
phates, ApnA, which were ﬁrst discovered 40 years ago
(37,38). Ap4A is composed of two adenosines and four
phosphates linked in 50 to 50-phosphodiester linkages. The
role of ApnAs in higher eukaryotes has remained elusive.
Recently, ApnAs have been suggested to play a role as
putative extra- and intracellular signaling molecules.
Ap4A itself is involved in the cellular stress response,
inhibition of KATP channels, stimulation of DNA replica-
tion and repair, as well as inﬂuencing other essential
cellular processes in eukaryotes (37,38). Presently, the only
link between Ap4A and 3
0-end processing was described in
yeast where stimulation of primer independent synthesis
by yeast poly(A) polymerase was observed in the presence
of dinucleoside polyphosphates, including Ap4A (39).
There is no CF Im25 homolog in yeast but this observation
still suggests a potential role for dinucleoside polyphos-
phates as signaling molecules during RNA-processing
events. The concentration of ATP and Ap4A can ﬂuctuate
within the cell in response to cellular stress or growth.

(PDB ID code 1SU2) and 77–202 in CF Im25. Only one CF Im25
monomer is shown.

Preliminary experiments on the role of Ap4A during the
polyadenylation step of 30-end processing resulted in a
non-competitive inhibition of polyadenylation in a poly
(A) extension assay with mammalian PAP (results not
shown). This suggests that under conditions of high
concentrations of Ap4A such as stress, Ap4A can bind to a
site in PAP, other than the ATP binding site, to inhibit
polyadenylation.
The residues 81–160 of the Nudix domain play a dual
role, binding RNA and stabilizing protein–protein inter-
actions. Additionally, the amino terminus (1–76) partici-
pates in RNA binding (Figure 2) (7). A stable interaction
between CF Im25 and CF Im68, unlike that involving PAP
or PABPN1, requires the entire CF Im25 protein. CF Im68
must contact regions outside of the known RNA-binding
region of CF Im25 to promote complex formation and
stimulate pre-mRNA 30-end processing. Interestingly, CF
Im25 has a patch of negatively charged surface residues
that runs the length of the dimer interface (Figure 7A).
This charged region is composed of residues primarily
from beta strand b3 and helix a4 and could potentiate
protein–protein interactions with CF Im25’s other bind-
ing partners, possibly CF Im68. Also intriguing is the
observation that a binding interaction between the sub-
strate RNA and the 25 kDa subunit occurs in the absence
of a putative RNA-binding domain. This suggests another
mechanism of RNA recognition, possibly through homo-
dimer formation. A CF Im25 homodimer may enhance the
binding potential to the RNA substrate compared to a
monomer interaction by increased surface area interac-
tions. A deﬁnite answer regarding the oligomeric state of
the 25 kDa subunit and the RNA-binding mechanism will
have to await a CF Im25 structure with RNA bound.
The results reported here suggest that CF Im25 is unable
to hydrolyze nucleotides or dinucleotides even though it
harbors a classic Nudix fold. The Nudix domain of CF
Im25 may instead facilitate protein–protein interactions, as
suggested by the large distribution of charged residues in
the electrostatic surface representation of the Nudix
domain. This charge distribution of the Nudix domain
correlates well with results from pull-down experiments
with PAP and PABPN1 (7).
The interaction of CF Im with the RNA substrate and
with PAP stimulates the rate of polyadenylate tail
synthesis. This may be facilitated by the binding of ATP
to CF Im25. Preliminary data (S. Dettwiler and W. Keller,
unpublished) showed that CF Im25 interacts with hClp1, a
protein shown to bind ATP which is involved in 30-pre-
mRNA processing and tRNA splicing (40,41). This
observation, in conjunction with the fact that hClp1 has
recently been shown to function as an siRNA kinase and a
kinase that phosphorylates the 50-end of the 30-splicing
product in human tRNA splicing (42), suggests a possible
link between CF Im25’s binding of ATP and protein–
protein cross talk. Recently, CF Im25 has also been shown
to be associated in a large RNP complex with Rae1, an
mRNA export protein, in the nucleation and stabilization
of microtubules during spindle assembly (43). This
interaction is via CF Im25 association with an RNA
component of the RNP complex and suggests a role for
CF Im25 in mRNA export via direct RNA association that
may be inﬂuenced by the concentration of intracellular
nucleotides or dinucleotides.
