families

ABSTRACT
FSSP (families of structurally similar proteins) is a
database of structural alignments of proteins in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) [1]. The database currently
contains an extended structural family for each of 330
representative protein chains. Each data set contains
structural alignments of one search structure with all
other structurally significantly similar proteins in the
representative set (remote homologs, < 30 % sequence
identity), as well as all structures in the Protein Data
Bank with 70 - 30 % sequence identity relative to the
search structure (medium homologs). Very close
homologs (above 70 % sequence identity) are excluded
as they rarely have marked structural differences. The
alignments of remote homologs are the result of
pairwise all-against-all structural comparisons in the set
of 330 representative protein chains. All such
comparisons are based purely on the 3D co-ordinates
of the proteins and are derived by automatic (objective)
structure comparison programs. The significance of
structural similarity is estimated based on statistical
criteria. The FSSP database is available electronically
from the EMBL file server and by anonymous ftp (file
transfer protocol).
INTRODUCTION
It has been estimated that the biochemistry of all living organisms
involves no more than 1,000 divergently related protein families
[2]. A majority of newly determined protein sequences can be
classified into families by detectable sequence homology. The
HSSP database of sequence alignments [3] shows that at least
26% of known sequences deposited in public databases (not
counting cDNA fragments) have a relative of known 3D
structure. However, protein families are known to retain the shape
of the fold even when sequences have diverged below the limit
of detection of significant similarities at the sequence level.
Structural comparisons merge protein families of known 3D
structure into structural classes, the members of which may or
may not be evolutionarily related [4-7]. The FSSP database of
structural alignments provides a rich source of information for
the study of both divergent and convergent aspects of the
evolution of protein folds.
The FSSP data sets have a wide field of applications. These
include studies to discover remote evolutionary connections in
the twilight zone of sequence similarity; to build a multiple
alignment of remotely related families for the generation of
sequence profiles or sequence patterns that may identify additional
remote relatives in sequence databases [8-9]; to classify folds,
such as TIM barrels, in order to study their structural principles
[10]; to define structural cores for sequence-structure alignment
(T. Smith, pers. comm.), for modular construction of novel
proteins, or for model building by homology [11]; to test the
accuracy of sequence alignment methods (B. Rost and
R.Schneider, pers. comm.); or, to use test sets of remotely
homologous pairs for fold recognition (M. Sippl, pers. comm.)
and to extract representative data sets for statistical structural
analyses [ 12]. Other uses are only limited by your imagination.
FORM AND CONTENT OF THE DATABASE
Structural alignments
For a protein chain in the representative set, with PDB identifier
Nxxx (like: IPPT, 5PCY) and chain identifier Y (omitted if
blank), there is an ASCII (text) file Nxxx.FSSP or NxxxY.FSSP
which contains a few or tens of proteins structurally similar to
the search structure (Z-score above 2 in the pairwise structural
comparison, see below), alongside the secondary structure and
solvent accessibility extracted from the 3D coordinates of the
search structure [13]. The structurally equivalent residues are
reported in the form of a multiple alignment and as a list of
matching fragments and can be inspected using three-dimensional
graphics. The co-ordinates must be retrieved separately from the
corresponding PDB data sets, e.g. Nxxx.PDB. Details about the
methods used to derive the database are given in [14,15].
Figure 1 shows an example dataset from FSSP, that for the
SH3 domain of chicken brain alpha-spectrin (ISHG.FSSP).
General information about the structure and notation are given
at the top of the dataset. The dataset contains 5 (NALIGN)
structurally aligned proteins which are listed in the '# #
PROTEINS' section. ISHF-A is the homologous SH3 domain
from fyn (PROTEIN column) and is aligned with a positional
root mean square deviation of 1.6 A (RMSD column) over 57
residues (LALI column) and has 33 % sequence identity after
structural alignment (%IDE column). The other structural
homologs are two more SH3 domains (lHSP is misannotated
in the PDB), actinidin, and biotin repressor. Some structural
details are given in the ' # # ALIGNMENTS' section. Residue
W42 (Trp) of 1SHG is in a beta-strand (E) and has a solvent

Figure 1. Format of an FSSP file. One FSSP file contains a structural protein family: the search structure and structurally homologous proteins from the PDB.
File organization is line-oriented and strictly formatted. Lines have a maximum length of 132 bytes. The file is divided into four sections, HEADER, PROTEINS,
ALIGNMENTS and FRAGMENTS. The sections are separated by double hashes (# #). The HEADER section is mandatory. The HEADER, PROTEINS and
ALIGNMENTS sections are similar to those in the HSSP database [3], with obvious modifications of notation that are explained in the HEADER block. The FRAGMENTS
section reports the beginning and ending residue numbers of structurally equivalent segments. The residue ranges are given both according to sequential numbering
starting from 1 and, in parentheses, according to the numbering in the PDB files.
accessibility (ACC column) of 39 A2. W42 has a structurally
equivalent residue in 5 (NOCC) of the aligned structures, of
which three are tryptophans (W), two are leucines (L), and all
five are in beta-strands (b or e in We, Wb, Le, We, Le). Finally,
the '# # FRAGMENTS' section says that to superimpose the
3D coordinates of lSHG with those of 1SHF, residues 6-46
and 47-62 of 1SHG should be equivalenced with residues
A84-A124 and A127-A142 of 1SHF.
The default files (Nxxx.FSSP) contain structural alignments
generated by the program Dali [15] and are constrained to
preserve sequential ordering of the aligned segments. Alignments
optimized allowing topological permutations (loop reconnections
and chain reversals) are available in files Nxxx_dali.FSSP.
Alignments using other methods are available in datasets
Nxxxsuppos.FSSP and Nxxx_comp3D.FSSP [14].
Index of protein fold families
To aid navigation in the database, the 330 protein chains contained
in the representative set have been clustered into fold families
(Table I). A dendrogram of the families was produced by average
linkage clustering based on structural similarity scores [15]. Chain
length effects were corrected for by transforming the pairwise
similarities into statistical significance scores (Z-scores). Families
and subfamilies result from truncating the tree at different cut
levels of Z-score. The higher the cut, the larger the resulting
number of distinct fold families (Figure 2). 142 families resulting
from the cut at an average Z-score of 2 are numbered in the first
column of Table I. Second and further members of a family are
indicated by indentation relative to the first member at the given
level of significance. For example, if one decided to derive a
Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 17 3603
more refined selection of fold families using a Z-score cutoff of
3 instead of 2, then the set of families should be expanded by
all subfamilies that are indented by one letter space in Table I,
yielding a total of 168 families. The most refined selection
possible in the representative set would place each of the 330
chains in a distinct family, but even a cut as high as a Z-score
of 10 yields only 255 families (Figure 2).
In comparing proteins with very low sequence identity, there
is no direct relationship between the structural Z-score and
evolutionary relatedness. To assert descent by common ancestry,
the biological function, sequence signatures and architectural
detail should be considered. For example, the very distantly
related animal/plant lysozymes and T4 lysozyme are classified
into two neighbouring families (21 and 22) using the structural
Z-score, although they share some structural and biochemical
features. As an example of common folding motifs, family 57
in Table I contains six structures with the babbab fold typified
by muconolactone isomerase (IMLI).
DISTRIBUTION
Network access
The FSSP data sets can be obtained from the EMBL file server
[ 16]. To get detailed instructions on how to use the service send
the messages 'HELP' and 'HELP proteindata' to the network
address Netserv@embl-heidelberg.de. If you have access to
Internet you can obtain FSSP files by anonymous ftp (file transfer
protocol) from ftp.embl-heidelberg.de, directory: /pub/data-
bases/protein-extras \ fssp. Access to the database is also
possible over the World Wide Web (WWW), e.g. using the
XMosaic interface; the URL address is http://www.embl-
heidelberg.de/databases/proteinr extras \ fssp. Distribution by
the Protein Data Bank (pdb.pdb.bnl.gov) is planned for late 1994.

level of structural similarity
Figure 2. Definition of structural classes. The June 1994 release of the FSSP
database is based on a sequence-representative set of 330 protein chains (less
than 30 % sequence identity). Average linkage clustering using the similarity
scores from an all-against-all structural comparison yielded a tree representation
of structural relations in the set (cf. Table 1). Truncating the tree at different
levels of structural similarity (horizontal axis, Z-score) defines distinct families,
i.e., separated branches of the tree. Cutting at a very low level (Z < < 2) leads
to a collapse into a very few general classes (all-alpha, all-beta). Cutting at a
high level increases the number of distinct families, with a gradual approach to
one family per protein chain.
The SUPPOS program is available as part of the WHAT IF
package (available from G.Vriend, email: vriend@embl-
heidelberg.de). The program Dali is currently not available for
distribution. Requests for alignments of newly solved
crystallographic or solution NMR structures (Ca co-ordinates
required) may be sent to L.Holm by email (holm@embl-
heidelberg.de).
Conditions
Academic redistribution of single files or of the entire database
is permitted. No inclusion in other databases or database services,
academic or other, without explicit permission of the authors.
All rights reserved. Not to be used for classified research. Users
are asked to refer to this paper and ref. 14 in reporting results
on use of the database.
Size of the current release
The content and size of the FSSP database is of course tightly
coupled to the development of the Protein Data Bank which is
currently increasing at the rate of hundreds of datasets every year.
The size of the sequence-representative set of PDB files [17],
which is used here as a point of departure, has increased from
154 in December 1992 to 204 in October 1993 to 330 in June
1994. The complete set of data files (June 1994) requires about
11 Mb of disk storage. Regular and frequent updates of the
database are planned.
Limitations
The structure comparison program Dali [15] defines the extent
of the common structural core by maximizing the agreement of
intramolecular CA-CA distances. The scoring function was
deliberately designed to allow inter-domain conformational
flexibility; hence, positional root mean square deviations for the
corresponding rigid-body superimpositions are often higher than
for comparison methods that put an absolute upper limit on
intermolecular positional deviations. This, however, is only an
apparent disadvantage.
The current database contains at most one alignment per pair
of full length proteins. In future releases, the significance of
alignments will be evaluated at the level of structural domains
[18], i.e., parts of structures, and significant suboptimal
alignments will be included. PDB data sets are referred to by
the PDB code; no provision can be made for asynchronous
revisions of the PDB data sets relative to the derived database.
Related data banks and programs
It is often useful to complement the compilation of structure
alignments with sequence and variability information by direct
reference to the latest version of the HSSP database of sequence-
aligned protein families [3]. Users interested in detailed local
structural properties of each protein, such as hydrogen bonding
patterns, may refer to the DSSP database of secondary structures,
derived from PDB files. The HSSP and DSSP databases are
available by the same mechanism of network access as FSSP,
see above. An X-windows based protein query and 3D inspection
system, ProtQuiz 0.7 (Sander & Scharf, unpubl.; test version
available via anonymous ftp from ftp.embl-heidelberg.de), can
be used for interactive evaluation of pairwise alignments. The
FSSP database is cross-referenced with several sequence and
other databases in the information retrieval system SRS [19] with
access provided on www.embl-heidelberg.de. Kindly report any
problems to the authors by electronic mail.

Structural classification of protein chains in the database of three-dimensional structures (PDB). The sequential index of the fold family is followed by PDB and
chain identifiers and protein names of a family member. Family 1 has 2 members (lacx, lcobB), family 2 has 11 members (Iten, 2hhrB, ...) and so on. Indentation
in the 'PDB code' column means that a protein belongs to the same family/subfamily as the protein above. The families are defined by cutting an average linkage
clustering tree at a similarity level of 2 standard deviations above expected (Z = 2). Subfamilies are defined by cuts at similarity levels of Z = 3, 4, 5, 6 and
10; more refined family divisions can be made at each level of similarity. For example, 3dpa and 4ait of family 32 are split in two separate families if the cut is
made at Z = 3 rather than at Z = 2; lacx and lcobB (family 1) end up in different families if a cut is made at Z=5; 2hhmA and 3fbpB (family 10) stay together
even at Z = 10. Only chains in the sequence-representative set (maximally 30% sequence identity) are reported here; higher than 30% sequence identity between
homologous proteins implies, in general, structural similarity that would be far off the scale to the right.
