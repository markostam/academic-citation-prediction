Angiogenesis and Pericytes in the Initiation of
Ectopic Calcification
G.D.M. Collett, A.E. Canfield
Abstract—Ectopic calcification of blood vessels, heart valves, and skeletal muscle is a major clinical problem. There is now
good evidence that angiogenesis is associated with ectopic calcification in these tissues and that it is necessary, but not
sufficient, for calcification to occur. Angiogenesis may regulate ectopic calcification in several ways. First, many
angiogenic factors are now known to exert both direct and indirect effects on bone and cartilage formation. Second,
cytokines released by endothelial cells can induce the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. Third, the new blood
vessels provide oxygen and nutrients to support the growing bone. Finally, the new blood vessels can serve as a conduit
for osteoprogenitor cells. These osteoprogenitor cells may be derived from the circulation or from pericytes that are
present in the neovessels themselves. Indeed, there is now compelling evidence that pericytes can differentiate into
osteoblasts and chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Other vascular cells, including adventitial myofibroblasts,
calcifying vascular cells, smooth muscle cells, and valvular interstitial cells, have also been shown to exhibit
multilineage potential in vitro. Although these cells share many properties with pericytes, the precise relationship
between them is not known. Furthermore, it still remains to be determined whether all or some of these cells contribute
to the ectopic calcification observed in vivo. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that link
angiogenesis, pericytes, and ectopic calcification should provide a basis for development of therapeutic strategies to treat
or arrest this clinically significant condition. (Circ Res. 2005;96:930-938.)

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from anexisting vascular bed, is not only of fundamental impor-
tance for normal development but also for the progression of
a variety of different pathological conditions. Recent studies
have shown that angiogenesis is associated with ectopic
calcification at many different sites including blood vessels,
heart valves, and skeletal muscle. In addition, it is now
recognized that not only are pericytes involved in regulating
angiogenesis, but also that these cells can differentiate along
several lineages including osteogenic and chondrogenic, sug-

gesting that pericytes may also be involved in ectopic
calcification. Together, these data suggest that angiogenesis
and ectopic calcification may be intimately associated and,
moreover, that pericytes may be one of the common factors
linking these processes. This review will critically evaluate
the evidence supporting this suggestion. Particular emphasis
will be placed on ectopic calcification of blood vessels;
calcification at other sites will be mentioned briefly.
Angiogenesis and Ectopic Calcification of
Blood Vessels
Calcification of blood vessels is a common complication of
many diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, end stage
renal disease, and calciphylaxis, and is generally considered
to be a significant predictor of future adverse clinical
events.1–6 Calcification can occur throughout the vasculature,
from the large aorta through to dermal microvessels, and it
can be identified in both the media and intima. Within
arteries, calcification occurs as small dispersed crystals of
hydroxyapatite, mineralized bone-like tissue containing mar-
row and cartilaginous tissue.1–6 Current evidence suggests
that vascular calcification is a complex process reminiscent of
endochondral bone formation and repair. Several factors
involved in the regulation of vascular calcification have been
identified, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2),
transforming growth factor- (TGF-), fetuin-A, parathyroid
hormone-related polypeptide, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-
), matrix Gla protein, Axl, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin,
oxidized lipids, and deregulated calcium and phosphate
metabolism.1,2,5,7 However, whether the mechanism of calci-
fication is the same throughout the vasculature or is depen-
dent on site-selective responses to specific modulators is still
not known.
Angiogenesis and Calcification in
Atherosclerotic Lesions
The association between angiogenesis and arterial disease
was first suggested more than a century ago, when it was
noted that atheromatous vessels contained new blood vessels
within their intima. However, it is only in the last decade that
the potential functional significance of this neovasculariza-
tion to disease progression has come to be realized. The
association between neovascularization and sites of calcifica-
tion in atheromatous lesions is only just starting to be
appreciated with, to date, only a few studies commenting on
its potential significance.
The first indication that angiogenesis and ectopic calcifi-
cation may be associated came from the imaging studies
conducted in the 1980s in which silicone polymers were
injected into cleared fixed human hearts, and the pattern of
vascular filling was recorded by cinematography.8,9 Detailed
analysis of the cinematographic images demonstrated abun-
dant neovascularization in association with sites of lesional
calcification. Subsequent histological examination of these
specimens revealed that the microvessels were localized in
both the media and thickened intima of atheromatous vessels
and that the extent of neovascularization correlated with
disease severity.9 Furthermore, by comparing the histology of
these lesions, the anatomical location of microvessels within
the lesions and the cinematographic findings, it was shown
that calcification was only detected in vessels with abundant
neovascularization, although not all lesions with neovascu-
larization were calcified.9 Using a complimentary approach,
Zamir & Silver produced “casts” of the entire coronary
network in human hearts and demonstrated the presence of
“extensive mesh-like vascular networks” near the lumen of
atheromatous vessels.10 Furthermore, they demonstrated that
the networks were frequently associated with sites of calcifi-
cation within the lesions and that some of the casts contained
calcium deposits.
Since that time, the majority of evidence for the presence
of angiogenesis in atheromatous plaques has been obtained
from histological studies using markers of endothelial cells
(eg, von Willebrand factor, CD31, and CD34) to identify new
blood vessels within the artery wall. Using these techniques,
it has been possible to demonstrate where the new blood
vessels are localized, their origin, and at which stage of lesion
development they appear. Nevertheless, there is still a dearth
of information regarding the ultrastructure of these neoves-
sels; in particular, it is still not known whether these new
blood vessels contain an intact perivascular coat.
Immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cells has
demonstrated that the majority of new blood vessels are
localized in the shoulder and cap regions of late stage plaques
(Figure 1) in an apparently asymmetrical distribution.11–14
The bases of plaques are also, in general, highly vascular-
ized.11 The majority of new vessels have been shown to
originate from the adventitial vasa vasora, with some new
vessels originating from the lumen of the artery.11,14 In
agreement with the earlier morphological studies, these stud-
ies have also confirmed that intimal neovascularization is
present in early, advanced, and late-stage plaques and that the
extent of neovascularization correlates with disease severi-

ty.11–14 Interestingly, Jeziorska and colleagues15 also noted
that numerous blood vessels were localized around bony
deposits in the atherosclerotic lesions. However, it has also
been reported that vascular density decreases in extensively
hyalanized or calcified intimas, although new vessels were
still reported in these lesions.14 As angiogenesis may contrib-
ute to the initiation of ectopic calcification in atheromatous
lesions, a study detailing the precise association between sites
of angiogenesis and ectopic calcification of blood vessels is
clearly warranted.
It is now evident that angiogenesis is a key event in both
the initial development of atheromatous lesions and in their
subsequent progression. This close association between an-
giogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis has been con-
firmed in recent studies conducted using animal models that
have shown that treatment with angiogenic inhibitors inhibits
disease progression, whereas angiogenic factors promote this
process.16–18 In addition, the presence of microvessels in
plaques is generally associated with adverse clinical events.
First, expansion of the vasa vasora allows perfusion of the
artery wall when thickening diminishes the extent to which
oxygen can diffuse from the luminal blood.16 Second, the new
blood vessels contribute to plaque formation by leaking
albumin and fibrinogen into the artery wall.11 Third, intimal
microvessels are associated with sites of hemorrhage in the
plaques and with plaque rupture.11,19 Fourth, leukocytes,
macrophages, and mast cells are localized around new blood
vessels in lipid-rich plaques, suggesting that these neovessels
are directly involved in inflammatory cell recruitment, and
hence, lesion progression, calcification, and destabilisa-
tion.12,13 Finally, as will be discussed in detail, the new blood
vessels may directly contribute to the development of ectopic
calcification in the lesions.
Angiogenesis and Calcification in Transplant
Arteriosclerosis, End Stage Renal Disease,
and Diabetes
Angiogenesis and calcification are common features of trans-
plant arteriosclerosis.20,21 However, it is not clear whether the
new blood vessels observed in the media and neointimal
lesions of transplanted vessels are formed by the same
mechanism as in native vessel atherosclerosis. For example,
Hu et al21 have recently shown that when mouse aortas were
allografted into the carotid arteries of chimeric mice with
bone marrow derived from TIE2-LacZ mice, -galactosidase
activity was seen within the neointimal lesions of the allo-
grafts. This indicates that the endothelial cells within the
microvessels were derived from bone marrow cells rather
than from the vasa vasora as described for atheromatous
lesions.
Interestingly, it has recently been shown that a large
population of progenitor cells, expressing the Stem cell
antigen Sca-1, are present in the adventitia of ApoE-deficient
mice.22 These Sca-1 cells differentiated into smooth muscle
cells in response to incubation with PDGF-BB in vitro or,
when incubated with VEGF, into endothelial cells. Further-
more, when Sca-1 cells carrying the lacZ gene were trans-
ferred to the adventitial side of vein grafts in ApoE-deficient
mice, -galactosidase–positive cells were detected in the
atherosclerotic lesions of the intima where they were found to
contribute to lesion development and progression.22 It is
tempting to speculate that these progenitor cells may be
activated by the dyslipidemic stimuli that concomitantly
promote angiogenic responses within atherosclerotic lesions,
thereby contributing to lesion development and progression,
including vascular calcification.
The occurrence of angiogenesis in vessels with medial
calcification caused by end stage renal disease or diabetes has
not been examined in detail. However, it has recently been
demonstrated in animal models that diabetes increases oxi-
dative stress and induces an inflammatory response in the
adventitia23 and that removal of the adventitia can prevent
medial artery calcification in rats fed an atherogenic
calcification-inducing diet.24 Moreover, adventitial myofibro-
blasts (pericytes) have been shown to contribute to the medial
calcification in diabetes (see below).5 Whether these cells are
related to the Sca-1 adventitial progenitor cells as mentioned
in the previous paragraph remains to be determined.
Association Between Angiogenesis and Ectopic
Calcification at Other Sites
Cardiac Valves
Calcification of native human heart valves and porcine
xenograft bioprosthetic valves can lead to valve stenosis and,
ultimately, death. Current evidence suggests that clinical risk
factors associated with atherosclerosis may also be involved
in valvular calcification and degeneration.25,26 Features re-
lated to bone formation and remodeling, such as the presence
of cartilaginous nodules and mature lamellar bone with
hemopoeitic elements, have been demonstrated in surgically
removed human heart valves.27,28 In addition, proteins asso-
ciated with chondrogenesis and osteogenesis have been iden-
tified in these tissues, including osteopontin, bone sialopro-
tein, alkaline phosphatase, and BMP-2 and -4.27–30 Recent
studies suggest that valvular calcification in calcific aortic
stenosis is regulated by many factors, including TGF-1,
oxidized lipids, the renin-angiotensin system, and RANKL-
OPG pathway.26,31,32
As with blood vessels, angiogenesis and ectopic calcifica-
tion are colocalized in heart valves.27,30,33 Extensive neovas-
cularization has been noted adjacent to regions of woven
bone within calcified human heart valves.30 Furthermore,
immunostaining of samples identified expression, by both
smooth muscle actin–positive cells and macrophages, of
proteins associated with osteogenesis. These cells were lo-
cated along the calcifying front of mineralization zones, at the
valve edge, zona fibrosa, and in the developing neovascula-
ture.30 More recently, Mohler et al27 reported neoangiogen-
esis within all heart valves undergoing ossification. These
authors postulated that inflammatory cells and subendothelial
microvascular pericyte–like cells (myofibroblasts) created a
microenvironment that could support ectopic calcification
and ossification of heart valves.27 Extensive angiogenesis has
also been demonstrated in non-rheumatic aortic valves with
moderate stenosis.33 Furthermore, VEGF and its receptors
have been localized to activated endothelial cells, stromal

fusiform myofibroblasts, and histocytic cells in these
valves.33
Skeletal Muscle
Much of our understanding of heterotypic ossification within
skeletal muscle is derived from case reports that provide
detailed pathological descriptions of the lesions. However,
the identification and study of a hereditary form of the
condition, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), has
provided a basis for understanding the molecular nature of
heterotypic bone formation in skeletal muscle. FOP is an
autosomal dominant disorder, which is recognized by con-
genital malformation of the great toes, heterotypic ossifica-
tion of soft tissue, and its temporal progression along a
characteristic anatomic pattern.34,35 Lesions can appear spon-
taneously or as a result of local trauma. This makes FOP
difficult to study as taking biopsies from these patients is
contraindicated, because the local trauma would stimulate
further advancement of the disease. Pathological develop-
ment of FOP lesions arises as severe inflammation of the
connective tissue with intramuscular edema. These areas
gradually form an angiogenic fibroproliferative mass that
calcifies over time and is reminiscent of endochondral osteo-
genesis.34 Identification of a general underlying defective
gene or family of genes responsible for FOP remains elusive.
However, current literature implicates dysfunctional morpho-
genic gradients, involving members of the bone morphoge-
netic protein family (eg, BMP-2 or BMP-4) and their antag-
onists (eg, noggin or gremlin).36–38
Recent studies have suggested that osteoprogenitor cells in
skeletal muscle may originate from the muscle tissue or
associated microvasculature. Osteogenic progenitor cells iso-
lated from skeletal muscle were shown to induce ectopic bone
in vivo when transduced with BMP-2; however, the identity
of these cells was not determined.39 Subsequently, primitive
osteoprogenitor cells isolated from intramuscular connective
tissue were identified as pericyte-like,40 and recent studies
have shown that stromal cells from early FOP lesions have a
smooth muscle cell lineage.41 These cells also expressed the
osteogenic transcription factor Cbfa-1 and were immunore-
active for osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein.41 Hegyi and
colleagues postulated that these osteoprogenitor cells might
originate from perivascular pericytes, medial vascular smooth
muscle cells, adventitial fibroblasts, or from the bone marrow
stroma, highlighting the strong association between angio-
genesis and the heterotypic ossification of skeletal muscle.41
Ectopic Calcification in Other Tissues
The association between angiogenesis and ectopic calcifica-
tion has also been noted at other sites. For example, a
statistically significant association between increased micro-
vascular density and microcalcifications in ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS) has been noted.42 Circumstantial evidence has
also indicated a role for pericytes or pericyte-like cells in
calcifying fibroblastic granuloma (CFG), a lesion of the
gingiva characterized by recurrent calcified nodules within
the vascular basement membrane, metaplastic bone forma-
tion, and dense neovascularization.43 Choroidal osteoma,
which is characterized by the presence of mature bone
containing marrow spaces within the choroid, is usually
associated with choroidal neovascularization.44 Calcifications
of the retina, retinal vessels, and the presence of osseous
metaplasia in the retina have also been noted in patients with
renal failure, Coats’ disease, tuberous sclerosis, and retino-
cytomas.45,46 Whether calcification in these lesions is associ-
ated with angiogenesis has not been determined.
Placental calcification is associated with placental matura-
tion. Hydroxyapatite crystals have been localized within the
basement membrane of chorionic villi, and membrane parti-
cles resembling matrix vesicles have been reported.47 It is still
not clear whether the mechanism underlying placental calci-
fication is similar to that described for physiological and
ectopic calcification or is more reminiscent of metastatic
calcification.48 Whether placental calcification is associated
with angiogenesis is not known, but it is noteworthy that
pericytes isolated from placental microvessels spontaneously
form nodules that mineralize.49
How Might Angiogenesis Initiate
Ectopic Calcification?
Angiogenesis may initiate ectopic calcification in several
ways. First, the invading blood vessels can act as a conduit for
osteoprogenitor cells. The source of osteoprogenitor cells in
blood vessels is unclear, but it may include circulating
progenitor cells or pericytes present in the neovessels them-
selves.50–54 This latter possibility will be discussed in detail
below. Second, cytokines (for example, BMP-2 and BMP-4)
released by endothelial cells have been shown to induce both
the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells and calcification in
vitro and in vivo,55–58 although this effect is context-
dependent.57 Interestingly, the expression of these cytokines
is markedly upregulated in response to inflammatory and
mechanical stresses, which themselves can also promote
vascular calcification in specific clinical contexts.59,60 Third,
many angiogenic factors can also exert direct and indirect
effects on osteogenic and chondrogenic cells.61 For example,
FGF-2 induces angiogenesis, is mitogenic for mesenchymal
cells and osteoblasts,62 enhances bone formation in vivo,63
and induces remodeling of bone by osteoclasts.64 In addition,
it is now recognized that VEGF, long considered to be
endothelial cell–specific, can act directly on osteoblasts,
chondrocytes, and osteoclasts. Thus VEGF and its receptors
are expressed by osteoblasts, and VEGF induces their migra-
tion and differentiation.65,66 VEGF also stimulates the forma-
tion, survival, and resorption activity of osteoclasts67 and is a
chemoattractant for osteoclasts.68 Chondrocytes also express
VEGF and its receptors and respond to stimulation by
exogenous VEGF in vitro by activating VEGFR-2.69 Inter-
estingly, many of these factors have also been identified at
sites of ectopic calcification in blood vessels, cardiac valves,
and skeletal muscle.1–6,29–31,34–41,70–72
Finally, several proteins (eg, bone sialoprotein and os-
teopontin) that were originally identified in bone and which
have also been identified at sites of ectopic calcification in
blood vessels, heart valves, and skeletal muscle are now
known to exhibit angiogenic properties. Thus, evidence is
accumulating for a proangiogenic role for bone sialoprotein
through an RGD-mediated interaction with v3 integrin.73

In addition, bone sialoprotein is involved in the early stages
of mineralization and bone resorption.74 Osteopontin has been
implicated in several processes including angiogenesis, in-
flammation, biomineralization, and bone resorption.75,76 It is
noteworthy that phosphorylated osteopontin is a potent inhib-
itor of ectopic calcification in blood vessels.77,78
Pericytes, Angiogenesis, and
Ectopic Calcification
Ebreth and Rouget first described the presence of perivascu-
lar cells closely associated with capillaries more than 100
years ago. Since then these cells have been given a variety of
different names, including adventitial cells, Rouget cells,
mural cells, periendothelial cells, perivascular cells, histio-
cytes, and deep cells. Zimmerman introduced the term “peri-
cyte” (peri, around; cyto, cell or vessel) in 1923.79–81
Pericytes are present in precapillary arterioles, capillaries,
and postcapillary venules. In addition, recent studies have
suggested that pericytes, or cells resembling pericytes, have a
more widespread distribution in the human body. Thus, using
antibody 3G5, which recognizes a cell-surface ganglioside
present on pericytes but not smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts,
or endothelial cells, pericyte-like cells have been identified in
the inner intimal layer, the outer layer of the media, and in
vasa vasora in the adventitia of large, medium, and small
arteries and veins.72,82 Cells with pericyte-like characteristics
have also been identified in the kidney (mesangial cells), liver
(Ito cells), and bone marrow (reticular cells).80 Furthermore,
pericytes share many similarities with myofibroblasts, and the
possible distinction between these cells is not always clear.
The origin of pericytes is still not fully understood. Studies
conducted using quail-chick chimeras have demonstrated that
pericytes are derived from the neural crest, whereas endothe-
lial cells are derived from the mesoderm.83,84 However, other
studies have suggested that pericytes have a mesodermal
origin.80,85 In addition, it has recently been shown that
perivascular cells (ie, pericytes or smooth muscle cells) and
endothelial cells can be derived from a common progenitor
cell (Figure 2).22,86 Incubation of these progenitor cells with
PDGF-BB stimulates their differentiation into pericytes/
smooth muscle cells, whereas VEGF stimulates their differ-
entiation into endothelial cells.22,86 Further evidence support-
ing the crucial role of PDGF-BB signaling in pericyte
recruitment and differentiation in the embryo has come from
studies in which this gene, or the gene encoding its receptor
(PDGFR-), was deleted in mice. Pericytes were absent from
brain, renal, and retinal vessels resulting in endothelial
hyperplasia, abnormal vascular morphogenesis, and microan-
eurysm formation.87,88 Interestingly, it has been suggested
that pericytes may also be derived from smooth muscle
cells,89 fibroblasts,90 endothelial cells,91 and the bone mar-
row,92 although the factors that stimulate the differentiation of
these cells into pericytes and the relative contributions of
these cells to the generation of pericytes in adult and
embryonic tissues is not clear. As well as being derived from
multiple cell types, it is now apparent that pericytes have
multilineage potential and are capable of differentiating into
a variety of different cell types (Figure 2).80,93 This aspect of
pericyte function and its potential relevance to ectopic calci-
fication will be discussed in detail below.
Pericytes are morphologically, biochemically, and physio-
logically heterogeneous, although these cells do exhibit many
characteristic properties.79–81,85,94 Pericytes are (1) elongated
cells that are embedded within a basement membrane, (2)
located adjacent to or over endothelial cell junctions, and (3)
have multiple elongated processes that wrap around and
along the blood vessel and which can extend between blood
vessels within the microcirculation. These cells can also
communicate with endothelial cells through peg-and-socket
contacts, adhesion plaques, gap junctions, and tight junc-
tions.79–81,85,94 Pericytes are further characterized by the
presence of a heterochromatic nucleus, large numbers of
plasmalemmal vesicles, contractile microfilament bundles,
and glycogen deposits. The relative frequency and distribu-
tion of pericytes varies between different vascular beds and is
also dependent on the developmental stage. For example,
retinal vessels have been reported to contain pericytes and
endothelial cells in a 1:1 ratio, whereas in striated muscle the
ratio may be 1:100.94
Figure 2. Pericytes can be derived from
a variety of progenitor cells including
mesodermal cells and neural crest cells
(collectively termed ‘smooth muscle pro-
genitors’) or from common vascular pro-
genitors which can be induced to differ-
entiate into pericytes/smooth muscle
cells by PDGF-BB or into endothelial
cells by VEGF. These common progeni-
tor cells include embryonic stem cells,
circulating stem cells and Sca-1 pro-
genitor cells present in the adventitia.
Endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth
muscle cells and bone marrow cells
have also been reported to give rise to
pericytes. Pericytes, adventitial myofi-
broblasts and smooth muscle cells share
many properties including the ability to
give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes
and adipocytes. It is not known whether
pericytes and adventitial myofibroblasts
are the same entity. Calcifying vascular cells (CVCs) appear to have a more restricted differentiation capacity and may, therefore, repre-
sent a cell that is further along the differentiation pathway than pericytes.

Several markers for pericytes have been described, includ-
ing -smooth muscle actin (-sm actin), non-muscle actin,
muscle and non-muscle myosin, desmin, high molecular
weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA or NG2
proteoglycan), aminopeptidase-N, aminopeptidase-A, the
regulator of G-protein signaling-5 (RGS5), and a cell-surface
ganglioside (3G5).93,95 However, none of these markers are
absolutely specific for pericytes nor will any of them recog-
nize all pericytes in vitro and in vivo. For example, some
antibodies (eg, -sm actin and HMW-MAA) recognize peri-
cytes in vitro and “activated” pericytes in vivo but do not
recognize pericytes present in normal “resting” capillar-
ies.93,95,96 Furthermore, pericyte identification is complicated
by their marked heterogeneity and by their ability to differ-
entiate into other cell types.
Pericytes serve a variety of functions in the normal vessel
wall. They are contractile cells capable of regulating vessel
caliber and permeability and, as such, are often likened to the
smooth muscle cells of larger blood vessels. However, these
cells are not identical. Pericytes also provide mechanical
support and stability to the vessel wall as a result of their
direct interactions with endothelial cells and by the synthesis
of basement membrane proteins. In the brain, pericytes also
appear to possess phagocytic activity and may therefore be
important regulators of the blood–brain barrier. These func-
tions have been reviewed extensively elsewhere and will not
be discussed further herein.80,81,85,93,94
Pericytes and Angiogenesis
The involvement of endothelial cells in angiogenesis has been
the subject of intense investigations for several decades. In
contrast, our understanding of the extent of the involvement
of pericytes in angiogenesis is only just beginning to be
appreciated as new technologies become available.95,97 It is
well established that the investment of newly developing
capillaries with pericytes during the later stages of angiogen-
esis is essential for the production of stable, non-leaky
vessels.95,97,98 However, how pericytes are recruited to newly
forming blood vessels is still not fully understood, although
several factors, including PDGF-BB, VEGF, and GTPase-
activating proteins (eg, Rgs5), are clearly involved.87,88,95,97,99
In addition, it is now becoming accepted that pericytes are
also involved in the early stages of angiogenesis, although
their precise role may depend on where the angiogenesis
occurs.95 Thus, pericytes have been localized to the growing
tips (or angiogenic “sprouts”) of new vessels.96,98 In this
location, they are thought to be involved in (1) the initial
patterning of the vascular networks, particularly in the retina,
(2) regulating endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation,
and junction formation, (3) regulating capillary diameter, and
(4) synthesizing matrix proteins.81,88,95,97 Further clarification
of the involvement of pericytes in angiogenesis associated
with atherosclerosis is eagerly awaited.
Pericytes and Ectopic Calcification
Maximow and Ehrlich first suggested that perivascular cells
may be “resting wandering cells” or “primitive mesenchymal
cells” more than 50 years ago, as reviewed by Tilton.79 Since
then, it has been shown that pericytes can differentiate into
many different cell types including osteoblasts, chondrocytes,
adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and Leydig cells
(Figure 2), suggesting that they may serve as a source of adult
progenitor cells in situations of repair, inflammation, and
disease.93,100,101 The finding that pericytes can differentiate
into osteoblasts and chondrocytes suggests that these cells
may play a role in mediating ectopic calcification.
Perhaps the first evidence that pericytes could differentiate
into osteoprogenitor cells came from Urist’s group in the 1980s.
Using an experimental model of wound repair in the skull, these
workers demonstrated that BMP induced the osteogenic differ-
entiation of pericytes resulting in the formation of chondroid and
woven bone.50 Subsequently, by following the fate of Monastral
blue–labeled vascular cells during experimentally induced os-
teogenesis and chondrogenesis, Diaz-Flores et al demonstrated
that these cells could differentiate into osteoblasts and chondro-
cytes.51,52 In addition, recombinant endothelial cell growth factor
was found to induce both angiogenesis and osteogenesis in an
orthopaedically expanded suture in the rat.102 As the osteopro-
genitor cells were located in close proximity to blood vessels,
these workers concluded that activated pericytes were the source
of osteoprogenitor cells. Definitive proof that pericytes could
differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes was obtained
when pericytes were loaded in diffusion chambers and im-
planted into athymic mice. Areas resembling bone, cartilage,
mineralized cartilage, fibrocartilage, and non-mineralized carti-
lage with lacunae containing chondrocytes were formed in these
chambers.53,100
When cultured in standard growth medium in vitro,
pericytes display a reproducible pattern of growth and
differentiation, culminating in the formation of large
multicellular nodules containing a mineralized matrix after
8 weeks.53,103,104 The nodules formed by pericytes con-
tain an extracellular matrix comprising type I collagen,
osteopontin, matrix Gla protein and osteocalcin, strongly
resembling the matrix found in calcified vessels.1– 6,53,93 In
addition, hydroxyapatite crystals have been identified
within the nodules and the ratio of calcium to phosphate is
similar to that found in bone.103 This pattern of growth and
differentiation can be modulated by culturing the cells on
collagen gels,103 in the presence of -glycerophosphate,103
decreased oxygen tension,104 antibodies to MGP,105 ad-
vanced glycation end-products,106 or by inhibiting Axl-
Gas6 signaling.107 By culturing the cells as pellets in the
presence of a defined chondrogenic medium containing
TGF-3, pericytes can be induced to undergo chondro-
genic differentiation in vitro.100 The chondrocyte markers
type II collagen, aggrecan, and sox9 were identified in
these pellets; these molecules have also been identified in
calcified vessels.1– 6,100
Together, these data demonstrate that pericytes can differen-
tiate along the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages in vitro and
in vivo and deposit a matrix resembling that found in calcified
blood vessels. Interestingly, cells resembling pericytes, namely
calcifying vascular cells (CVCs),72,108 adventitial myofibro-
blasts,5,109 vascular smooth muscle cells,49,110,111 and interstitial
cells isolated from heart valves31,112 have also been found to
form mineralized nodules and to exhibit multilineage potential in
vitro. In addition, CVCs stain positively with the 3G5 anti-

body,72 although they exhibit a more restricted differentiation
potential108 than has been described for pericytes,53,100
adventitial myofibroblasts,5,109 and human smooth muscle
cells.110,113 Interestingly, some populations of aortic smooth
muscle cells do not form nodules in vitro but rather deposit a
mineralized matrix when they are cultured in the presence of
-glycerophosphate.77,114 The reasons for these differences
are not clear, but may reflect either the extensive heteroge-
neity that exists within the vasculature, the origin of the cells,
or where the cell is located along the differentiation pathway.
Furthermore, it is not yet known whether all or some of these
cells contribute to the ectopic calcification observed in vivo.
Summary
The extensive vasculature associated with sites of ectopic
calcification caused by active angiogenesis occurring in
atheromatous vessels, cardiac valves, and skeletal muscle
could act as a conduit for the delivery of osteoprogenitor cells
to the lesions. In conjunction with growth factors and cyto-
kines released by endothelial cells and localized inflamma-
tory cells, the microenvironment would be permissive for
these cells to commit to an osteogenic differentiation path and
to deposit a calcified matrix. There is now compelling
evidence that these osteoprogenitor cells may be the pericytes
that are present in the new blood vessels, suggesting that
these cells may provide the cellular link between ectopic
calcification and angiogenesis. Several key questions still
remain to be addressed. For example: What is the relationship
between pericytes, adventitial myofibroblasts, calcifying vas-
cular cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, adventitial progen-
itor cells, and valvular interstitial cells? How are pericytes
maintained as pericytes in normal vessels? How is pericyte
differentiation along specific lineages regulated? Is pericyte
differentiation reversible? What contribution do these cells
make to ectopic calcification in vivo? A further understand-
ing of the underlying mechanisms that link angiogenesis,
pericytes, and ectopic calcification should provide a basis for
development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat or arrest
this clinically significant process.
