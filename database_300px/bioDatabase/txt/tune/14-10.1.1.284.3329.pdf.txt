ABSTRACT
During assembly, bacterial virus phi29 utilizes a
motor to insert genomic DNA into a preformed protein
shell called the procapsid. The motor contains
one twelve-subunit connector with a 3.6 nm central
channel for DNA transportation, six viral-encoded
RNA (packaging RNA or pRNA) and a protein, gp16,
with unknown stoichiometry. Recent DNA-packaging
models proposed that the 5-fold procapsid vertexes
and 12-fold connector (or the hexameric pRNA ring)
represented a symmetry mismatch enabling produc-
tion of a force to drive a rotation motor to translocate
and compress DNA. There was a discrepancy regard-
ing the location of the foothold for the pRNA. One
model [C. Chen and P. Guo (1997) J. Virol., 71,
3864–3871] suggested that the foothold for pRNA
was the connector and that the pRNA–connector
complex was part of the rotor. However, one other
model suggested that the foothold for pRNA was
the 5-fold vertex of the capsid protein and that
pRNA was the stator. To elucidate the mechanism
of phi29 DNA packaging, it is critical to confirm
whether pRNA binds to the 5-fold vertex of the capsid
protein or to the 12-fold symmetrical connector.
Here, we used both purified connector and purified
procapsid for binding studies with in vitro transcribed
pRNA. Specific binding of pRNA to the connector in
the procapsid was found by photoaffinity crosslink-
ing. Removal of the N-terminal 14 amino acids of the
gp10 protein by proteolytic cleavage resulted
in undetectable binding of pRNA to either the
connector or the procapsid, as investigated by agar-
ose gel electrophoresis, SDS–PAGE, sucrose
gradient sedimentation and N-terminal peptide
sequencing. It is therefore concluded that pRNA
bound to the 12-fold symmetrical connector to
form a pRNA–connector complex and that the
foothold for pRNA is the connector but not the capsid
protein.
INTRODUCTION
In living systems, components are routinely and actively trans-
ported by molecular motors, such as F1-ATPase (1–3), kinesin
(4–6), myosin (7–9), helicase (10, 11), viral DNA or RNA-
packaging motors (12–14). The viral DNA-packaging motor
of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages (e.g. phi29,
l, P22, T4 and T7) can translocate DNA with remarkable
velocity into a limited space in a preformed protein shell called
a procapsid at the expense of ATP hydrolysis during assembly
(15–21). Studies on bacteriophage phi29 and T7 have shown
that a motor is also involved in the ejection of DNA from the
procapsid during viral infection (22,23).
The procapsid of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi29
consists of the major capsid protein gp8 (235 copies), head
fiber protein gp8.5 (55 copies), scaffolding protein gp7
(180 copies) and connector protein gp10 (12 copies) (24–27).
Through studies involving the bacterial virus phi29 DNA-
packaging motor, a molecule known as pRNA that plays a
novel and essential role in packaging DNA into procapsids
was discovered (28). Six copies of pRNA have been found to
form a hexameric ring (29–31) to drive the DNA-packaging
motor. The construction pathway for pRNA goes from mono-
mer to dimer and then to hexamer (32).
One of the essential components of the phi29 DNA-
packaging motor is the connector complex, a dodecameric
cylindrical structure with a 36 s central channel, through
which viral DNA is packaged into the capsid and exits during
the infection process. The specific structure of the phi29 phage
portal protein has been determined at atomic resolution
(33–35). The phi29 connector ring consists of 12 alpha-
helical subunits, with an inner channel being formed by
three long helices of each subunit. The wider end of the con-
nector is located in the procapsid, with the narrow end partially
protruding from the procapsid. Owing to the structural

flexibility of both the N- and C-terminal regions, the crystal
structure of 13 amino acids at the N-terminus and 24 amino
acids at the C-terminus were not solved and were missing from
PDB file 1H5W (34), while 10 amino acids at the N-terminus
and 24 amino acids at the C-terminus were missing from PDB
file 1FOU (35). From structural analysis, it is evident that the
N-terminus protrudes from the narrow end of the connector
and the C-terminus protrudes from the wider end of the
connector (Figure 1) (34–36). The C-terminus is buried within
the procapsid and the N-terminus is exposed to the solvent.
Some DNA-packaging models proposed that the 5-fold pro-
capsid vertexes and 12-fold connector (or the hexameric pRNA
ring) produced a force to drive the phi29 rotation motor to stuff
DNA (34,35,37,38). Rotation of the connector, which is a 12-
subunit complex, within the capsid, a 5-fold symmetrical
environment, could constitute a mechanical motor in which
the relative motion of the two rings could drive DNA into the
procapsid. Although the notion of the generation of physical
force from a rotary motor with a symmetry mismatch between
two rings is particularly interesting, no one has directly proven
this model with experimental data. The published DNA-
packaging models all agreed that pRNA bound to one com-
ponent to execute a consecutive rotation (34,35,38). There
were discrepancies regarding the location of the foothold
for the pRNA, and the determination of which component
is the rotor and which is the stator. To make two rings rotate
relatively, at least one additional component is needed to
provide a propelling force. The model by Chen and Guo
(38) suggested that the foothold for pRNA was the connector
and that the pRNA–connector complex was part of the rotor.
pRNA could thus be a candidate for this third component. It
was demonstrated that pRNA forms a hexamer (29–31). Six
copies of pRNA are bound to the connector and work sequen-
tially (38), and pRNA contains two functional domains
(Figure 2) (39,40). One domain, composed of the central
region of the pRNA, binds to the procapsid. The other domain,
which functions as a DNA translocation domain, is located at
the 50/30 paired ends. In this configuration, it is free for inter-
action with an additional but as yet unidentified component,
such as gp16, the 5-fold symmetrical capsid membrane or
genomic DNA–gp3. The interaction of pRNA or of the
pRNA/gp16 complex, which is tethered to the connector,
with the capsid membrane or DNA lattice may provide the
propelling force for connector rotation. However, another
model (35) proposed that the foothold for pRNA was the 5-
fold vertex of the capsid protein and that pRNA was the stator.
To elucidate the mechanism of phi29 DNA packaging, it is
critical to confirm whether pRNA binds to the 5-fold vertex of
the capsid protein or to the 12-fold symmetrical connector. In
this report, we demonstrate that the N-terminal region of gp10
is essential for pRNA binding, and that the foothold of pRNA
is not the 5-fold vertex of the capsid protein but instead the
connector. Removal of the N-terminus of gp10 from both
purified connector and the procapsid resulted in undetectable
binding of pRNA to the procapsid.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Connector production
The construction of the plasmid harboring the gene coding
for gp10, the over-expression of gp10 and the purification of
phi29 connector have been reported recently (36,41). The
connector with N-terminal his-tag was over-produced in
Escherichia coli and purified by a one-step elution with
imidazole from Ni2+-charged His-Bind columns (HisBind
Kits, Novagen).
Synthesis of pRNA
Methods for the synthesis and isolation of wild-type pRNA I-i0
have been described previously (32,42,43).
UV crosslinking of [32P]pRNA to procapsid and
connector
[32P]pRNA I-i0 was co-incubated with the connector in TMS
buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM
NaCl) for 5–10 min at ambient temperature. Procapsid–
[32P]pRNA I-i0 complex was produced by dialyzing the
pRNA/procapsid mixture against TBE on a 0.025 mm VS filter
(Millipore Corp.) at ambient temperature for 15 min, and then
dialyzed against TMS for 30 min. Both complexes were then
irradiated with short wavelength UV light (254 nm maximum)
using a MINERALIGHT1 lamp (UVP Model UVGL-58, Inc.)
for 20 min at a distance of 5 cm. The crosslinked samples were
treated with RNase A and resolved on 10% SDS–PAGE. The
gel was then autoradiographed (71).

Binding of pRNA to purified connector
An aliquot of 120 pmol gp10 was mixed with 12 pmol pRNA
I-i0 in TMS buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2
and 100 mM NaCl) for 5–10 min at ambient temperature. The
complex was then loaded on 0.8% agarose gel in 1· TAE
buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2, and the gel was run with
constant current at 4C. The gel was first stained with ethidium
bromide to show the presence of RNA bands. The agarose
gel was then stained by Coomassie brilliant blue (0.004%
Coomassie brilliant blue in 0.5% methanol and 8.5% acetic
acid) with gentle agitation at RT overnight to show the
protein bands.
Proteolytic treatment of connector or procapsid
The connector or connector–pRNA complex was treated by
proteinase V8 (endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus
aureus V8, Roche) with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:20
(w/w) for 16 h at 25C (46). Procapsid was treated in the
same manner as the connector. The proteolytic products
were detected by 10% SDS–PAGE.
N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of
proteolytic connector
The proteinase V8 pretreated connector was separated by 10%
SDS–PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane and
stained by 0.2% Ponceau S. The desired band was cut out
and subjected to N-terminal peptide sequencing.
Separation of connector–pRNA complex or
procapsid–pRNA complex by sucrose gradient
sedimentation
Sucrose gradient sedimentation was performed to separate the
connector–[3H]pRNA complex, connector–[3H]pRNA com-
plex treated by V8 before or after adding [3H]pRNA
I-i0, procapsid–[3H]pRNA I-i0 complex and procapsid–
[3H]pRNA I-i0 complex treated by V8 before or after adding
[3H]pRNA I-i0. Procapsid–[3H]pRNA I-i0 complex was pre-
pared as described above. Subsequently, it was treated by V8
in the same manner as the connector–pRNA complex. The
above complexes were loaded onto the top of a linear
5–20% sucrose gradient in TMS and spun in a Beckman
L-80 ultracentrifuge at 35 000 r.p.m. for 30 min at 20C in
a SW55 rotor. Upon centrifugation, fractions were collected
from the bottom of the tube and prepared for scintillation
counting.
Electron microscopy of connector–pRNA complex or
procapsid–pRNA complex
Carbon-coated transmission electron microscope (TEM) grids
were made hydrophilic by glow discharge and floated for
10 min on drops of connector–pRNA complexes, which
were purified from sucrose gradient centrifugation. The
grids were passed >4 drops of 10 mM MgCl2 for 5 min and
stained with 2% uranyl acetate containing 10 mM MgCl2 for
5 min. Electron micrographs were taken on a Philips CM10
TEM. Procapsid–pRNA complexes were made in the same
way as the connector.
In vitro phi29 virion assembly assay
The purification of procapsids, gp16, DNA–gp3, the prepara-
tion of neck and tail proteins and the assembly of infectious
phi29 virion in vitro have been described previously (44).
Briefly, 1.5 ml of purified procapsids and V8-cleaved pro-
capsids with or without 100 ng pRNA were dialyzed on a
0.025 mm VS filter against TBE for 15 min at ambient tem-
perature and were then dialyzed against TMS for another
30 min. The pRNA-enriched procapsids were mixed with
gp16, DNA–gp3, and reaction buffer to complete the DNA-
packaging reaction. After 30 min, neck, tail and morphogenic
proteins were added to the DNA-packaging reactions to com-
plete assembly of infectious virions, which were assayed by
standard plaque formation.
RESULTS
Photoaffinity crosslinking of pRNA to connector
To elucidate the mechanism of pRNA action, it is necessary to
know whether pRNA binds to the connector gp10 or to the
capsid protein gp8. A UV crosslinking assay was performed to
address this question. After binding [32P]labeled pRNA to
either the procapsid or the purified connector (Figure 3),

boxed and in bold. Two functional domains are outlined.

the RNA/procapsid or pRNA/connector complex was
irradiated with short wavelength UV light. When
[32P]pRNA was crosslinked with procapsid, the band in
SDS gel corresponding to gp10 was specifically labeled,
while gp8 was not, indicating that pRNA selectively bound
to gp10 (Figure 3, lanes A and B; lanes a and b).
Binding of pRNA to the N-terminus of the connector
investigated by gel shift assay
The crystal structure of the connector has been solved
(34,35,45). Although the structure and geometrical localiza-
tion of N-terminal residues of gp10 are not currently known,
since their region was missing in the reports published by two
separate laboratories (34,35), from the published structure
data it can be predicted that the N-terminal residues 1–13
are adjacent to the narrow end of the connector (Figure 1)
(36). To identify which part of the connector is responsible for
pRNA binding, the connector was purified to homogeneity.
The purified connector was incubated with pRNA and then
subjected to 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. When con-
nector was mixed with pRNA, an extra band with slower
migration rate appeared. This nascent band was stainable
by both ethidium bromide (Figure 4A, lane 3) and Coomassie
brilliant blue (Figure 4B, lane 3). The mixture was also RNase
A sensitive (Figure 5A and B, lane 4), suggesting that the band
was the connector/pRNA complex.
When the connector was pre-digested with endoproteinase
Glu-C (protease V8) and then mixed with pRNA, the nascent
ethidium bromide-sensitive band did not appear (Figure 4A,
lane 6) and only the smear Coomassie brilliant blue band
presented (Figure 4B, lane 6), similar to the proteolysis profile
of free connector treated by V8.
The slow migration rate of the cleaved connector in agarose
gel (Figure 4B, lane 4) can be explained by the change in the
charge of the connector after V8 cleavage, since the N-
terminus of gp10 contained basic charged amino acids protrud-
ing from the narrow edge of the connector cylinder (34–36).
N-terminal protein sequence analysis
To confirm the specific cleavage site and the removal of the
N-terminal residues by V8 proteolysis, a protein band of

product was cut from the SDS–PAGE and subjected to protein
sequencing. N-terminal peptide sequencing of the purified
V8-treated gp10 revealed that the N-terminal sequence is
IQRQKRN, which indicated that the V8 proteolytic site of
gp10 was located after the Glu residue. This confirmed that
V8 digestion removed the first 14 amino acids from the N-
terminal of the gp10, as illustrated in Figure 1. This result also
agreed with the previous report with sequence mapping data
showing that V8 removes 14 amino acids from the N-terminus
and 18 amino acids from the C-terminus of the connector
subunit gpl0 (45,46). For the connector–pRNA complex trea-
ted by V8, SDS–PAGE yielded two bands (Figure 6, lane5).
When the connector was mixed with pRNA, it formed a rosette
(Figure 7A). It is evident that the N-terminus of the connector
was located within the rosette (36), which protected it from V8
cleavage. Thus, only C-terminus can be cleaved by V8 (Figure
6, lane 5). As noted earlier, the C-terminus of gp10 is buried
within the procapsid (Figure 1), and the N-terminus is exposed
to the solvent, and thus the N-terminus of gp10 in the
procapsid was cleaved by V8 (Figure 6, lane 2). However,
since the purified connector is free from the procapsid, both
the C- and N-terminal ends are accessible to V8 cleavage
(Figure 6, lane 4).
Binding of pRNA to the N-terminus of the connector as
demonstrated by sucrose gradient sedimentation
The role of the N-terminus of connector protein gp10 in pRNA
binding was further supported by sucrose gradient sedimenta-
tion. The purified connector was incubated with [3H]pRNA
and then subjected to 5–20% sucrose gradient sedimentation.
When connector was mixed with [3H]pRNA, a peak repres-
enting the connector–pRNA complex appeared and was cen-
tered on fraction 22 (Figure 7) (36). Negative stain electron
microscopy revealed that fraction 22 indeed contained
pure rosettes, representing the connector–pRNA complexes
(Figure 7A). However, this radioactive peak disappeared
when the connector was pre-digested with protease V8,

As noted in the text, in the procapsid, the C-terminus of gp10 is located at the wider end of the connector that is buried within the procapsid, while the N-terminus is
located at the narrow end of the connector that is exposed to the solvent. Treatment of connector or procapsid with V8 resulted in different sizes of gp10, since V8 can
cleave both the N- and C-terminus of gp10 of the free connector, but only the N-terminus of the gp10 that is buried within the procapsid. Gp8 is the capsid protein,
while gp8.5 is the fiber protein of the procapsid.
2644 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 8
indicating that the connector with the N-terminus cleaved
could not bind pRNA (Figure 7B). When the connector
was pre-incubated with RNA and then digested with V8, a
small peak appeared at fraction 22, representing the
connector–pRNA complex (Figure 7). Negative stain electron
microscopy revealed that this fraction contained only a small
amount of connector–pRNA complex (Figure 7C) as com-
pared with fraction 22 in connector–pRNA complex without
V8 treatment (Figure 7A). The finding of a small number of
connector–pRNA complexes is to be expected, since binding
of the connector to pRNA could protect the connector from
V8 digestion to a certain degree.
Binding of pRNA to the N-terminus of the connector
protein gp10 in procapsid
To ascertain whether pRNA can bind to the N-terminus of
gp10 assembled in the procapsid, the purified procapsid was
incubated with [3H]pRNA and subjected to 5–20% sucrose
gradient sedimentation. When the procapsid was mixed with
[3H]pRNA, a peak representing the procapsid–pRNA complex
appeared and centered on fraction 19–21 (Figure 8A and B).
However, when the procapsid was pre-digested with the
protease V8, this radioactive peak was again removed
(Figure 8A). SDS–PAGE of the cleavage profile of procapsid
showed that the band representing gp10 disappeared after V8
digestion, but there was no change in the band representing
major capsid protein gp8 and the fiber protein of the procapsid
gp8.5 (Figure 6, lane 2). Thus, protease V8 only cleaved the
connector protein gp10, but not the capsid protein gp8. This
suggests that the procapsid lacking the N-terminal region of
connector protein gp10 could not bind pRNA. This result
further supports the conclusion that the N-terminus of the
connector is essential for pRNA binding. In addition, the
procapsid–pRNA complex treated by V8 did not exhibit a
peak after sucrose gradient sedimentation (Figure 8B).
Furthermore, the procapsid or procapsid–pRNA complexes
treated by V8 were inactive in phi29 assembly (Table 1).
Procapsid with or without treatment by V8 was examined by
negative stain electron microscopy. There was no significant
change in the structure of procapsid after V8 treatment
(Figure 9A and B). In combination with the data from

SDS–PAGE showing that the molecular weight of gp8 remains
unchanged after V8 digestion, the results indicated that V8
cleavage produced a procapsid with a truncated connector
protein gp10 but with unchanged capsid.
DISCUSSION
Phi29 packages its genomic DNA into a procapsid with the aid
of the gp16 protein and pRNA molecules. Several DNA-
packaging models proposed that 5-fold/6-fold asymmetry pro-
duced a force to drive the rotation motor to stuff DNA
(34,35,37,38). Although the recent models all agree that
pRNA binds to one component to enable connector rotation
there were significant discrepancies regarding the location of
the foothold for pRNA, and concerning which component is
the rotor and which is the stator. The model by Chen and Guo
(38) suggested that the foothold for pRNA was the connector
and that the pRNA–connector complex was part of the rotor.
However, the model by Simpson et al. (35) suggested that the
foothold for pRNA was the 5-fold vertex of the capsid
protein and that pRNA was the stator. There was also consid-
erable debate concerning whether pRNA was a hexamer
(29,31,38,48) or pentamer (35).
To further investigate the discrepancy, it was critical to
confirm whether pRNA binds to the 5-fold vertex of the capsid
protein gp8 or to the 12-fold symmetrical connector. UV cross-
linking of RNA/procapsid or RNA/connector complex proved
that pRNA was specifically bound to the connector (Figure 3),
which has 12-fold (12 subunit) symmetry, but not the capsid
protein gp8. The nonappearance of pRNA/gp8 (capsid protein)
binding in the UV crosslinking experiment does not com-
pletely exclude the possibility of transient interaction of
pRNA with capsid protein. From the data, it can be concluded
that the affinity of pRNA to connector is much stronger than to
capsid, and that the connector is the foothold for pRNA. Com-
petition assays revealed that only the pRNA binding to the
procapsid is specific (32). The formation of connector–pRNA
complex or procapsid–pRNA complex was further demon-
strated by agarose gel shift assay (Figures 4 and 5) and/or
sucrose gradient sedimentation (Figures 7 and 8). In agarose
gel shift assay, the nascent RNase A-sensitive bands indicated
that pRNA binds to the connector (Figure 5A and B, lanes 3
and 4). It is difficult to calculate the binding ratio between
pRNA and connector, because there were protein smears or
traps inside the well of the gel. If the connector or procapsid
was pre-digested by V8, N-terminal peptide sequencing data
proved that V8 removed 14 amino acids from the N-terminus
of the connector protein gp10 (Figure 1). EM imaging and
X-ray crystallography have shown that the N-terminus is loc-
ated at the narrow end of the connector, which exposes outside
the procapsid, while the C-terminal of gp10 protein is at the
wider end of the connector, which is buried within the pro-
capsid and covered by the capsid protein (34,35). Thus,
although V8 can also remove 18 amino acids from the C-
terminus of the purified connector protein gp10 (45,46), it
is impossible that pRNA bind to the C-terminus of the con-
nector within the procapsid. It was also found that the inhibi-
tion of procapsid–pRNA complex formation was not due to the
cleavage of procapsid protein gp8 by V8, since SDS–PAGE as
well as EM imaging indicated that the capsid protein gp8 was
still present while gp10 was cleaved (Figure 6 and Figure 9A
and B). Since this gp10-truncated procapsid with intact capsid
protein could not bind pRNA, the capsid protein gp8 cannot be
the foothold for pRNA. Therefore, the conclusion is that
pRNA bound to the 12-fold symmetrical connector to form
a pRNA–connector complex and that the foothold for pRNA is
the connector. The finding that V8 treatment produced a pro-
capsid that could not bind pRNA argues against the conclusion
from a previous publication (35) that five copies of pRNA
binds to the capsid protein, which holds a 5-fold symmetrical
vertex. Thus, the gp10 N-terminal cleavage accounts for the
inhibition of phi29 in vitro virion assembly by V8 (Table 1).
All DNA-packaging motors of the dsDNA virus involve one
pair of nonstructural components. In 1987, we classified these
components into two categories according to their role in DNA
packaging (28). The larger component is involved in procapsid
binding, whereas the smaller component is involved in inter-
action with DNA. Subsequent extensive studies have suppor-
ted this categorization. Procapsid binding components in the
well-studied phages, other than phi29, include gpA in phage
lambda (49), gp12 in phi21 (50), gp17 in T4 (51), gp19 in T3
and T7 (52,53). The DNA interacting components include
gpNu1 in lambda (54,55), gp1 in phi21 (56), gp16 in T4

(57) and gp18 in T3/T7 (58,59). Emerging information reveals
that the DNA-packaging mechanism of cytomegalovirus and
adenovirus is very similar to that of phages. Herpes simplex
virus contains a pair of DNA packaging proteins ULI5 and
UL28 (64). Cytomegalovirus contains a pair of DNA-
packaging proteins pUL56 and pUL89 (60), while the pair
of DNA-packaging proteins for adenovirus is IVa2 and the
L1 52/55 kDa proteins (61–63,65,66). In bacteriophage T3,
the interaction of the larger DNA-packaging component gp19
with the connector has also demonstrated. Six molecules of
gp19 bound to the prohead at a saturating amount of gp19, but
the gp19 did not bind to the prohead lacking the connector (the
gp8-defecient prohead) (67). For lambda, it has been found
that the target component of gpA binding is the connector
protein, since studies with the gpA and connector double-
mutant revealed that a connector mutation can suppress a
gpA mutation that hinders the gpA binding to procapsid
(68,69). In phi29, it has been reported that there were three
non-capsid components that were involved in DNA pack-
aging: the terminal protein gp3, the DNA-packaging protein
gp16 and pRNA. Gp3 can be excluded from the group of
nonstructural DNA-packaging components, since gp3 is a
structural component in the mature virion. Consequently,
one gp16 and pRNA were considered as the candidate mem-
bers of the pair of the nonstructural DNA-packaging protein.
Accumulated data have positively confirmed that pRNA is the
procapsid-binding component (28,32,70,71). In this paper, we
have demonstrated that the target component of the procapsid
for pRNA binding is the connector, not the procapsid protein
gp8. This is in an agreement with the studies of phages T3 and
l, and reveals that pRNA is the counterpart of gpA of l and
gp19 of T3, since pRNA, gpA and gp19 all bind to the
connector and contain the ATP-binding motif (72–76).
The conclusion that pRNA binds to the N-terminus of the
connector protein gp10 agrees with other findings published
previously. Antibody probing and 3D reconstructions of phi29
procapsid indicated that pRNA interacts with the narrow end
of the connector (77). Labeling of the narrow end of the con-
nector with monoclonal antibodies hinders the binding of
pRNA to the connector (48,77). Comparing the procapsid
plus pRNA with the procapsid without pRNA led to the con-
clusion that pRNA was situated as a ring embracing the narrow
end of the connector (48). The docking of connector structure
solved by X-ray in the portal region of reconstructed pro-
capsids demonstrated that the pRNA forms a protruding
ring that embraces the distal (narrower) domain of the inter-
laced beta-strands of the apical region of the gp10 dodecamer
(34,47,48). The results agree with the 3D computer model
of phi29 motor complex, which shows that six pRNAs
form a hexameric ring surrounding the narrow end of the
connector (78).
