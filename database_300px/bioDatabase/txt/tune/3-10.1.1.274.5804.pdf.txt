ABSTRACT
TheMini-ChromosomeMaintenance (MCM) proteins
are candidates of replicative DNA helicase in eukarya
and archaea. Here we report a 2.8 A˚ crystal structure
of the N-terminal domain (residues 1–268) of the
Sulfolobus solfataricusMCM (SsoMCM) protein. The
structure reveals single-hexameric ring-like archi-
tecture, at variance from the protein of Methano-
thermobacter thermoautotrophicus (Mth). Moreover,
the central channel in Sso MCM seems significantly
narrower than theMth counterpart, which appears to
more favorably accommodate single-stranded DNA
than double-stranded DNA, as supported by DNA-
binding assays. Structural analysis also highlights
the essential role played by the zinc-binding domain
in the interaction with nucleic acids and allows us to
speculate that the Sso MCM N-ter domain may
function as a molecular clamp to grasp the single-
stranded DNA passing through the central channel.
On this basis possible DNA unwinding mechanisms
are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Mini-Chromosome Maintenance (MCM) proteins form
ring-like hexameric complexes which are commonly
believed to act as the replicative DNA helicase at the
eukaryotic/archaeal DNA replication fork (1,2). The six
eukaryotic MCM 2–7 proteins and the archaeal MCM
orthologs belong to the AAA+ (ATPases with other asso-
ciated cellular activities) super-family (3) and contain the
highly conserved ATPase sequence box in the central
region of their polypeptide chain (4). The intrinsic DNA
helicase activity displayed in vitro by the MCM 2–7
complex and MCM 4/6/7 subcomplex was found to be
weak and not processive (5,6). Conversely, the MCM
proteins from the archaea Methanothermobacter thermo-
autotrophicus (Mth MCM) (7,8), Sulfolobus solfataricus
(Sso MCM) (9) and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Afu MCM)
(10) were found to form homo-oligomeric assemblies
endowed with a robust 30–50 DNA helicase activities
in vitro. Since archaeal MCM complexes possess a
simpliﬁed composition and higher structural stability
with respect to the eukaryotic counterparts, they have
been extensively studied as an excellent model system for
structural/functional analyses of these hexameric DNA
helicases, which have been recently classiﬁed in the
helicases super-family 6 (11).
The structures of the MthMCM complex determined by
electron microscopy (EM) have shown various ring-like
assemblies, including hexamers (12), heptamers (13),
double-hexamers (14), double-heptamers (15) and even
ﬁlamentous multimers (16). The crystal structure of a
N-terminal fragment of Mth MCM (residues 1–286)
revealed a double-hexameric architecture with a positively
charged central channel wide enough to encircle single-
stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) DNA (17). However,
no structural information has so far been available for
other MCM proteins, including Sso MCM, which has
become an important subject of biochemical studies in
recent years (18–20). In contrast to Mth MCM, the Sso
protein assembles as a single hexamer as indicated by
analytical gel ﬁltration and glycerol gradient sedimentation
analyses, a feature shared by the Afu MCM protein (9,10).
Very recently, SsoMCM has been demonstrated to possess
a modular organization by limited proteolysis and bio-
chemical characterization of truncated forms of the protein
corresponding to the protease-resistant domains (21,22).
This analysis has revealed that the Sso MCM C-terminal
module comprising the AAA+ and the very C-terminal

domains (AAA+-C-ter, residues 269–686) displays
ATPase and DNA-melting activities, whereas the
N-terminal module (N-ter, 1–268) retains only a DNA-
binding activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
All chemicals were reagent grade. Restriction and
modiﬁcation enzymes were from New England Biolabs.
Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from GE
Healthcare. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and puri-
ﬁed by PRIMM (Milan, Italy). Crystallization reagents
were from Hampton Research.
Construction of the plasmid vectors for the expression of the
SsoMCMN-ter truncated protein
The construct for the expression of Sso MCM N-ter was
generated by a PCR-based approach using the pET29a-
SsoMCM vector as the template (9) and the oligonucleo-
tide MCM-Nde-for (50-AGAAAATATATAGCATATG
CAAGGAAATAC-30) as the forward primer (under-
lined is the NdeI restriction site) and the oligonucleotide
MCM-Eco-rev (50-ATTGGAATTCCTAGACTTTTTTG
TAACATTC-30) as the reverse primer (the EcoRI restric-
tion site is underlined in the reported sequence). The
ampliﬁed DNA fragment was subcloned into NdeI/
EcoRI-linearized pET29a vector (Novagen) to create the
pET29a-SsoMCM-N-ter plasmid. The insert of this
plasmid construct was sequenced in order to verify that
mutations had not been introduced during PCR.
Purification of the SsoMCMN-ter protein
The SsoMCM N-ter protein was produced in Escherichia
coli BL21 (DE3) Rosetta cells (Novagen) transformed with
the expression vector pET29a-SsoMCM-N-ter. Cultures
were grown at 378C in 4 l of LB medium containing
30 mg/ml kanamycin and 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol.
Induction with IPTG starts when the baterial culture
reached an Abs600 nm of 0.8. Cells were harvested after two
hours by centrifugation and the pellet was stored at –208C
until use. The recombinant E. coli cell pellet was thawed
and re-suspended in buﬀer A (25mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0,
2.5mM MgCl2) supplemented with a cocktail of protease
inhibitors (Sigma). Cells were lysed by two consecutive
passages through a French pressure cell apparatus
(Aminco Co., Silver Spring, MD, USA) at 2000 p.s.i. The
resulting cell extract was centrifuged for 30min at
30 000 rpm (Beckman) at 108C. The supernatant was
heat-treated at 708C for 10min followed by incubation
on ice for another 10min, and then the thermo-precipitated
proteins were removed by centrifugation. After adding
sodium chloride to a ﬁnal concentration of 50mM, the
supernatant was ﬁltered and loaded onto aMonoQHR10/
10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buﬀer B
(25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5mMMgCl2, 50mMNaCl).
Bound proteins were eluted from the column with a linear
gradient of NaCl (0.05–1.0M). Fractions containing the
recombinant protein were pooled. The sample, dialyzed
against buﬀer C (25 mMTris–HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mMMgCl2,
400 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v)) and concentrated, was
subjected to a preparative gel ﬁltration chromatography on
a Superdex G 75 HR 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in
buﬀer C. The recovered sample was concentrated to about
8 mg/ml. Protein concentration was estimated by the
Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad laboratories) from titration curves
made with bovine serum albumin as a standard.
Crystallization and data collection
The concentrated protein was stocked in 25mM Tris–
HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5mM MgCl2 and 400mM NaCl. Two
crystallization conditions were screened out and later
optimized at room temperature using the sitting drop
vapor diﬀusion technique, which resulted in two diﬀerent
crystal forms. Crystals with regular shape of hexagonal
prisms were grown with 1.8M ammonium sulfate in
sodium citrate buﬀer, pH 5.6–6.2, while plate-shaped
crystals were obtained under low salt condition in which
20% PEG 3350 was used as the major precipitant with
0.2M magnesium sulfate in sodium acetate buﬀer, pH 5.5.
Diﬀraction data for both crystal forms were collected at
the beam-lines ID23-1 and BM14, respectively at the
ESRF, Grenoble (France). Indexing results showed that
they belong to the space groups P1 and C2, respectively.
Structure solution and refinement
The crystal structure in space group C2 was solved by
molecular replacement using the program PHASER (23).
A search model was built from the coordinates of one
subunit of Mth MCM (PDB code: 1LTL) (17) by
maintaining all identical amino acids but mutating all
the others into serine residues. Owing to the substantial
movement of domain B and obvious conformational
diﬀerences in domain A between the two MCM proteins,
the main chain of domain A and B had to be manually
remodeled. Simulated annealing was done at the intervals
of modeling to remove errors and improve density map.
Once all amino acids were well-ﬁtted into the electron
density, the structure was reﬁned by the program
REFMAC (24) using TLS reﬁnement approach. The
ﬁnal reﬁned model was later used as the search model
for the P1 crystal, in which six protomers were found to
form a ring in the asymmetric unit. The same reﬁning
protocol using REFMAC after simulated annealing was
applied on this structure. All data collection and reﬁne-
ment statistics are summarized in Table 1.
DNA band-shift assays
The complementary synthetic oligonucleotides used to
prepare the blunt DNA duplex had the following
sequence: 50-TCTACCTGGACGACGACCGGGTATA
TAGGGCCCTATATATAGGGCCAGCAGGTCCATC
A-30 (56-mer upper) and 50-TGATGGACCTGCTGGCC
CTATATATAGGGCCCTATATACCCGGTCGTCCA
GGTAGA-30 (56-mer lower). The 56-mer upper oligonu-
cleotide was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and
[g-32P]ATP, as previously described (9). The labeled
oligonucleotide was annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of
the cold complementary strand (56-mer lower) to prepare
3236 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 10
the double-stranded DNA ligand. For the DNA mobility
shift assays, 10 ml mixtures were prepared which con-
tained: 200 fmol of [32P]-labeled DNA in 20mM Tris–
HCl, pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.7mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and the indicated
amounts of protein. Following incubation for 10–15min
at room temperature, complexes were separated by
electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide/bis gels
(37.5:1) in 0.5 TBE. Gels were dried down and analyzed
by phosphor imaging. The total percentage of protein–
DNA complexes for each protein concentration was
plotted against the concentration of free protein (as a
monomer). Free protein concentration was determined by
subtracting the concentration of the bound protein from
the total protein concentration, assuming that all
complexes represent bound hexamers. Where saturation
was reached, binding data were ﬁt to sigmoidal binding
curves by nonlinear least square analysis. The Hill
coeﬃcient (napp) and the concentration at the mid-point
of the titration curves (S0.5) were determined. Experiments
were performed in triplicate and the results averaged.
The program GraFit (version 3.1) was used for these
calculations.
RESULTS
Overall structure
In the crystallization trials, two crystal forms were
obtained from completely diﬀerent conditions; one using
high salt but the other bearing low-ionic strength. These
crystals belong to the space groups P1 and C2, respec-
tively. The data quality of C2 crystals is better in terms of
completeness, I/ and R-factor (Table 1) due to the
sensitivity of the P1 crystal against the cryo-buﬀer. As a
result, the model quality in space group C2 is superior to
that in P1, and thus structure descriptions hereafter as well
as ﬁgure preparation are based on the C2 structure only.
Even so, the structures of the Sso MCM N-terminal
domain (residues 1–268) in both crystal forms revealed a
similar single hexameric ring-like assembly (Figure 1A
and B), distinct from the double hexamer of Mth MCM.
This architecture agrees well with previous reports
showing that the MCM proteins from Sulfolobus solfata-
ricus and Archaeoglobus fulgidus form single rings in
solution (9,10). The protein packs in a similar way in these
two space groups, i.e. one hexamer makes loose contacts
to another in the head-to-end manner, clearly indicating
that Sso MCM N-ter can form stable single hexamers
under various conditions, as long as the protein concen-
tration is high enough. As shown in Figure 1A and B, the
ring size in the top view is slightly larger than that
reported for Mth MCM, although its height equals exactly
to one half of the Mth MCM double-hexamer (17).

Subunit structure
The two crystal forms revealed almost identical subunit
structures with an rmsd of 1.3 A˚ based on Ca-atom
superimposition. Like Mth MCM, the peptide chain of the
Sso MCM N-terminal domain also folds into three
distinct domains: A, B and C (Figure 1C). Domain A
protrudes out of the ring, endowing the hexamer with a
‘snowﬂake’ appearance; domain B contains the zinc-
binding motif and domain C provides a large buried
area between subunits. The topology of Sso MCM N-ter
analyzed by PDBSUM (25) is very similar to Mth MCM
(17) except for the discontinuity of a b-strand bridging
domain B and C. The strand corresponding to b4 in Mth
MCM is divided into two shorter strands in Sso MCM, b5
and b6, probably arising from a substantial movement of
domain B in comparison with the Mth counterpart
(Figure 3B). In addition to the variability of b-strands,
two more 310 helices are present in Sso MCM, one located
between a5 and b2 in domain A and the other between b10
and b11 (Figure 1C). Two loops display a high degree of
ﬂexibility as revealed by weak electron density and higher
B-values above the mean level. One of them present in
domain A (residues 21–30) extends from the external
surface of the hexameric ring, and the other (241–251)
forms a loop corresponding to the b-hairpin ﬁnger
pointing to the hexamer center in Mth MCM (225–228),
but is longer and adopts a more extended conformation in
Sso MCM.
The central cavity and b-hairpin loop
Similar to Mth MCM, the Sso MCM hexamer contains a
unique central channel with an inner surface predomi-
nated by positively charged residues, suggesting its
physiological role as a DNA-binding surface. The
encircled cavity displays a funnel-like contour in the
interior of the hexameric ring, with wide opening on its
top (diameter of 46 A˚) and a much narrower channel close
to the bottom (24 A˚; Figure 2A). Notably, the encircled
channel through the top till the bottom in the Sso hexamer
is apparently smaller than that of the Mth protein
(Figure 2B). In particular, the narrowest region inside
the Sso channel is 17 A˚ only (Figure 2A), signiﬁcantly
smaller than the value (23 A˚) reported for the crystal
structure of the Mth MCM N-ter (17). Possible errors
from diﬀerent measurement methods could be ruled out
since the same protocol was used in both cases such that
all distances were measured from side chain to side chain
(17). The narrowest part in the central cavity occurs at the
b-hairpin loop (241–251) which connects the last two
strands (b11 and b12) in domain C (Figure 1C), and are
believed to be crucial for DNA binding (18). These loops
are longer than the Mth MCM counterparts due to a ﬁve-
residue insertion in the Sso MCM primary sequence
(Figure 3A) and project further toward the interior
encircling a smaller space thereby. Obviously such a
narrow hole occurring in the central channel makes it
diﬃcult to accommodate dsDNA with a diameter of
23.7 A˚ in canonical B-form. Recent molecular mechanics
studies of DNA translocation have shown that a hole
with a minimum diameter of 20 A˚ is required for dsDNA
to permeate without loosing its structural integrity (26,27).
Nonetheless, the ﬂexibility of this b-hairpin loop restrict-
ing the narrowest space should be taken into consider-
ation. This region shows increased ﬂexibility indeed
compared with other fragments in the current model.
The side chains of amino acids on this loop are weakly
deﬁned but its main chain atoms ﬁt well into the electron
density (Figure 2C), indicating the pore wideness might be
somewhat inﬂuenced by the structural mobility of the
hairpin loops. Even so, from the current model one can
still expect that, accommodation of dsDNA requires
substantial conformational changes on the hairpin
region for signiﬁcant channel widening and/or consider-
able distortion of dsDNA as well. In contrast, encircling
of ssDNA apparently does not need such big conforma-
tional changes on either the protein or the nucleic acid.
Based on these considerations, we believe that the Sso

MCM N-ter portion is more suited to encircle ssDNA in
terms of energy and steric hindrance under physiological
conditions, although dsDNA binding cannot be com-
pletely ruled out. Modeling attempts also revealed hints
supporting this speculation. Only ssDNA could permeate
the central channel without any spatial conﬂict with
protein atoms, but dsDNA inevitably clashes with both
main chain and side chain atoms at the narrowest region
(data not shown).
Structural comparison withMthMCMN-ter
As Sulfolobus and Methanothermobacter belong to
Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea, respectively, it would be
interesting to compare the structures of their MCM pro-
teins. Structure-based sequence alignment (Figure 3A) and
subunit superimposition on C atoms (Figure 3B) were
made to this end. The two proteins share 28% sequence
identity and an rmsd of 2.6 A˚ on main chain overlay.
Nevertheless, striking divergence could be seen, mainly
occurring in three regions (Figure 3B). First, a loop
present in domain A (residues 21–30) protrudes from
the outer surface of the Sso MCM hexameric ring, but
the equivalent peptide in Mth MCM is much shorter and
folds into a tight turn. Given the unknown function of
domain A and poor conservation of the amino acid
sequence between residues 21–30 even in Crenarchaea, the
signiﬁcance associated with this protruding loop in Sso
MCM is uncertain. Another loop (241–252) present in
domain C forms a longer b-hairpin in Sso MCM. As
described above, it extends deeper into the central cavity,
leading to narrower encircled space for DNA. Conserved
basic residues on this loop (K246 and R247) were
demonstrated to be crucial in DNA remodeling (18). In
addition to these longer loops, the most remarkable
feature in the Sso MCM structure was found in the zinc-
binding domain, which is described below.
The zinc-binding domain shifts closer to the central channel
All MCM proteins contain a zinc-binding domain within
the N-terminal half of their polypeptide chain. Either the
C4 or the HC3 type has been found in the sequences of the
archaeal MCM homologs. Sso MCM contains a non-
classical zinc-ﬁnger motif with a sequence (H-X4-C-Xn-
CX2-C) divergent from the one (C-X2-C-Xn-C-X2-C)
present in Euryarchaea, like M. thermoautotrophicus,
A. fulgidus or Pyrococcus abyssi (Figure 3A) (28). Accord-
ing to a recent structural classiﬁcation of zinc-ﬁnger
motives (29), both types belong to the zinc-ribbon super-
family due to the occurrence of two knuckles connecting
three anti-parallel b-stands and a long disordered loop

(residues 156–178 in Sso MCM). Each knuckle donates
two ligands for zinc coordination, arranged in left-handed
geometry in both structures (Figure 3C and D). The ﬁrst
knuckle in Sso MCM (Figure 3C), though, is longer than
the Mth counterpart (Figure 3D) on which an extra
histidine residue (H146) is present. This amino acid is not
involved in zinc coordination, but has been identiﬁed as a
crucial residue in DNA binding (19). Despite common
features, the orientation of the zinc-binding motif in Sso
MCM diverges obviously from that in Mth MCM
(Figure 3B). In the current structure, the zinc atom
moves 7.2 A˚ with respect to that of Mth MCM, leading to
poor superimposition between the two structures
(Figure 3B). This is why remodeling was required after
phasing (see Materials and Methods section). The spatial
shift is partially towards the central cavity, which results in
considerable shrinkage of the channel bottom from 28 A˚
of Mth MCM to 24 A˚ of the Sso structure (Figure 2A and
B). Although the biological functions of the zinc-ribbon
domains are versatile, they are often found to be involved
in protein–DNA (30) or protein–protein interactions (31).
The role of the MCM proteins zinc-binding domain has
not yet been fully clariﬁed. The Mth MCM N-ter crystal
structure shows that the zinc-binding domains are located
at the hexamer–hexamer interface, but biochemical studies
also suggested that this domain might be involved in DNA
binding (19,32). The crystal structure in our study clearly
reveals a signiﬁcant spatial shift of the zinc-binding motif
and a narrower outlet for DNA passage. This pronounced
structural divergence favors the idea that the zinc-ribbon
domain may play a role in DNA binding/remodeling in
Sso MCM. In the reﬁned structure, as a matter of fact,
some amino acids in that domain inevitably contact the
nucleic acid, if DNA, whether ds or ss, is assumed to be
encircled in the central channel of Sso MCM.
DNA-binding activity of SsoMCMand its truncated
derivatives
In a previous report on the modular organization of Sso
MCM, the DNA-binding capability of various truncated
forms of this protein were analyzed by electrophoretic
mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (22). This analysis revealed
that the N-ter module binds a single-stranded 56-mer
oligonucleotide with an aﬃnity comparable to the full-sized
protein; whereas the AAA+-C-ter derivative binds ssDNA
with an aﬃnity greatly reduced and binding saturation was
not reached even at a high protein/DNAmolar ratio. Here,
we investigated the ability of Sso MCM and its truncated
forms to bind a 56-bp blunt-ended dsDNA by EMSAs. As
shown in Figure 4, the N-ter protein is noticeably impaired

in binding this ligand: a partial shift of the DNA probe was
observed only at a very high protein/DNA molar ratio
(60 pmol of monomeric protein versus 200 fmol of DNA
ligand). On the other hand, the full-sized SsoMCMand the
AAA+-C-ter protein are able to bind blunt DNA duplex
with comparable higher aﬃnity and the binding curves
revealed that these proteins associate to dsDNA in a
cooperative manner (Figure 4). This prompted us to ﬁt the
binding data to the Hill equations in order to calculate the
Hill coeﬃcient (napp) and the S0.5 values, the protein
concentration at the mid-point of the titration curve, as
described in Materials and Methods section. The values of
napp obtained for both proteins are much greater than 1
(4 0.2 and 6 1 for the full-sized Sso MCM and the
AAA+-C-ter derivative, respectively), clearly indicating
cooperative binding to the dsDNA ligand. The S0.5 values
calculated for the two proteins are comparable (0.51 and
1.2 mM for the full-sized Sso MCM and the AAA+-C-ter
derivative, respectively). The simplest interpretation of
these results is that at low concentrations Sso MCM is
mainly present in solution in a monomeric state with low
dsDNA-binding aﬃnity; whereas, at higher protein con-
centrations the formation of stable hexameric assemblies
with higher dsDNA-binding activity is favored.
DISCUSSION
The crystal structure of the Sso MCM N-terminal module
reveals a fold similar to the Mth MCM counterpart, but
important distinctive features can be observed. First of all,
the single-hexamer architecture found in two diﬀerent
crystal forms of Sso MCM is a distinctive feature with
respect to the Mth counterpart (17), which undoubtedly
corroborates the results of previous biochemical studies
(9). Nonetheless, it has been recently reported that highly
concentrated samples of the full-length Sso MCM elute
from a gel ﬁltration analytical column with a complex
broad chromatographic proﬁle compatible with the
presence of double-hexameric species (21). This ﬁnding is
consistent with the hypothesis that the MCM complex is
loaded at the replication initiation sites in a transient
double-hexameric form. However, in vivo biochemical
analyses are required in order to establish whether these
double-hexameric assemblies are biologically relevant.
More strikingly, the Sso MCM N-ter protein seems
more likely to encircle ssDNA, since the diameter of its
central channel appears to be signiﬁcantly smaller than
that of the Mth protein, particularly at the narrowest
region where the b-hairpin loops are located (Figure 2A
and B). The possibility of dsDNA binding cannot be
completely ruled out, but it would require dramatic
conformational changes of the b-hairpin loop, as revealed
by structural analysis and modeling attempts. By contrast
binding of ssDNA seems more likely since no considerable
conformational changes on either protein or the nucleic
acid is essentially needed. These considerations are
consistent with DNA binding preferences of the Sso
MCM truncated forms analyzed by EMSAs. In fact, the
N-ter protein displays high aﬃnity for ssDNA (22), but
much lower for dsDNA (Figure 4), while the C-ter module
(residues 269–686) shows comparable aﬃnity for dsDNA
as the intact protein (Figure 4).
Another distinctive feature of our structure resides in
the orientation of the zinc-binding domain. The physio-
logical role played by this domain in the MCM proteins
has not yet been clearly elucidated. Structural and
biochemical studies on Mth MCM stressed the idea that
the zinc-ﬁnger motif is involved in hexamer–hexamer
contacts (17,33), but some reports revealed that it is
involved in eﬃcient interaction with ssDNA (28,32).
Given that Sso MCM mainly assembles into single
hexamers, it seems unlikely that its zinc-ribbon domain
is responsible for hexamer–hexamer interaction. Previous
mutational data (19) and the results of our structural
analysis both suggest its crucial role in DNA binding/
remodeling. The spatial shift towards the channel interior
in comparison with Mth MCM enables the Sso MCM
zinc-ﬁngers to be closer and form contacts to the encircled
DNA. Based on the results of these structural and bio-
chemical studies, we propose that the Sso MCM N-ter
portion may function as a molecular clamp for ssDNA
with major protein–DNA contacts relying dominantly on
both the b-hairpin loop and the zinc-binding motif.
Diﬀerent possible models were proposed for the helicase
activity of the MCM complex (34). The rotary pump (35)
model is not applicable to Sso MCM because it is based
on the ability of the helicase to encircle dsDNA through
the entire length of its central channel. Even the LT-ag
model is not appropriate because it envisages that the
active helicase has a stable double-hexameric structure
(36). Conversely, despite the lack of experimental evi-
dences about its oligomeric state in vivo, Sso MCM
functions as an active helicase very likely in the form of a
single hexameric ring. Recently, a new model has been
proposed in which the traditional picture of two replica-
tion forks propagating bi-directionally is preserved and
the functional helicase unit is a single hexamer that
separates the two complementary strands by means of a
proteinaceous ‘ploughshare’ (34). A consistent model for
the Sso MCM unwinding mechanism would imply that
dsDNA is bound in the AAA+-C-ter central channel,
where the two complementary strands are separated in an
ATPase-dependent process; the unwound strand with
30–50 polarity (the leading strand) would be extruded by
the action of the N-ter portion, whereas the other strand
(the lagging strand) is expected to loop out from putative
lateral channels. Structural studies on SV40 LT-ag (37)
and Mth MCM (12,14,15) revealed in both cases the
presence of lateral holes on the hexameric wall. These side
channels, visible at the border between the N- and
C-terminal domains in high-resolution EM structures of
Mth MCM (14,15), could be present in the same location
even in Sso MCM considering the high structural simi-
larity between these two archaeal proteins. It is interesting
to observe that in the crystal structure of Mth and Sso
MCM N-ter modules the diameter of the inner channel
becomes quite wide on the C-terminus side, consistent
with the big central cavity observed between N- and
C-terminal domains in the EM images of Mth MCM (15).
The encircled space at this region is big enough to acco-
mmodate the two melted strands. The proposed model is
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 10 3241
consistent with our results on the DNA-binding prefer-
ences of the Sso MCM deleted forms (Figure 4) (22). An
additional argument in favor of the ‘ploughshare’ model
resides in the ﬁnding that either Afu MCM or mouse
MCM 4/6/7 complex were reported to bind bubble-
containing DNA molecules with high aﬃnity and to
protect the ds/ssDNA junctions from nuclease digestion in
foot-printing experiments (10,38). Furthermore, it was
proposed that DNA strand separation takes place within
the Mth MCM central channel by the ATPase-driven
coordinated motion of the b-a-b insert in helix-2 and the
pre-Sensor 1 b-hairpin (39). Nonetheless, an interesting
alternative is represented by the steric-exclusion model, in
which the helicase translocates on one DNA strand while
the other is physically excluded from the hexameric ring
(34). This model was originally proposed for the unwind-
ing mechanism of some bacterial helicases, such as DnaB
(40) and the bacteriophage T7 gp4 protein (41), and has
been recently reinforced by the crystal structure of the
papillomavirus E1 protein bound to ssDNA (42). The
‘steric-exclusion’ model was proposed for the Sso MCM
helicase action on the basis of ﬂuorescence spectroscopy
analyses aimed at probing the DNA-binding mechanism
of this protein complex (43). The results of our structural
analysis are consistent with the steric-exclusion model,
although this makes it more diﬃcult to account for the
diﬀerent DNA-binding speciﬁcity of the Sso MCM
truncated forms. Resolution of the crystal structure of
the full-sized Sso MCM hexameric complex bound to
DNA appears to be essential in order to elucidate its
helicase mechanism.
