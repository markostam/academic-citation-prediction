ABSTRACT
Natural RNAs contain many base modifications that
have specific biological functions. The ability to func-
tionally dissect individual modifications is facilit-
ated by the identification and cloning of enzymes
responsible for these modifications, but is hindered
by the difficulty of isolating site-specifically modified
RNAs away from unmodified transcripts. Using the
m1G37 and m1A58 methyl modifications of tRNA as
two examples, we demonstrate that non-pairing base
modifications protect RNAs against the DNA-directed
RNase H cleavage. This provide a new approach to
obtain homogeneous RNAs with site-specific base
modifications that are suitable for biochemical and
functional studies.
INTRODUCTION
RNA molecules undergo extensive post-transcriptional modi-
fications that are important for their biological activities. A
major category of post-transcriptional modifications is 20-O-
ribose methylation of the backbone, which occurs frequently
in ribosomal RNA and often at positions that are conserved in
evolution and essential for translation (1). The other category
of post-transcriptional modifications involves nucleotide
bases, which are predominantly found in tRNAs. To date,
the number of different types of base modifications identified
in tRNAs exceeds 100 (2). These modifications enrich the
chemical properties of nucleotide bases in ways that are sim-
ilar to those of amino acid side-chains, such as aliphatic, aro-
matic, polar and charged features (3). The diversity of base
modifications suggests that all organisms, bacteria, eukarya
and archaea, have a large investment in the metabolic and
energy requirements for tRNA modifications (4). Although
many of the tRNA base modifications are not understood at
the functional level, some have well-defined roles in transla-
tion and decoding of genomes. For example, modifications
that occur at the wobble position of the tRNA anticodons,
and those 30 adjacent to the anticodon make a large contribu-
tion to translational efficiency and accuracy (5–7), and help to
maintain a proper reading frame (8). The existence of these
modifications, diverse among different tRNA anticodon
sequences, demonstrates cellular dedication to the specificity
of decoding.
Studies of base modifications have benefited from identi-
fication and cloning of genes responsible for modifications.
For example, the tRNA base modification m1G37 is catalyzed
by the enzyme tRNA(m1G37) methyl transferase, using
S-adenosyl methionine as a methyl donor to the N1 position
of G37 (9). This modification is important for maintaining
reading frame fidelity during decoding (10–12). Genetic stud-
ies have identified the trmD gene of bacteria (13), and trm5
gene of eukarya and archaea (14,15) as responsible for encod-
ing the enzyme tRNA(m1G37) methyl transferase. Represent-
ative trmD and trm5 genes have been cloned and expressed in
Escherichia coli to yield active enzymes (15,16), using tRNA
transcripts lacking any modifications as substrates.
The ability to generate tRNA molecules containing a
single modification, introduced by the reaction of a well-
defined enzyme, offers new opportunities to dissect the
function of the specific modification. However, a major obsta-
cle remains, which is that the modification reaction is usually
not stoichiometric. For example, the m1G37 modification on a
transcript of tRNACys, as generated by reactions using purified
E.coli TrmD or an archaeal Trm5, is typically 30–50%, even
with excess of enzyme (15,17). The reason for the incomplete
reaction is unclear, but may be due to loss of enzyme
activity in some cases, or due to partial folding of the
tRNA transcript in other cases that prevent a proper anticodon
loop structure for modification. The incomplete reaction yields
mixtures of both modified and unmodified transcripts, which
hinders rigorous interpretation of biochemical studies. Thus, it
is highly desirable to have a method to separate the modified
transcript from the unmodified transcript. Because the two
types of transcripts differ by a single base modification,
our experience showed that conventional separation by
denaturing gel electrophoresis or by liquid chromatography
is difficult.

Here we describe a simple method of separation that can be
easily developed in any laboratory without sophisticated
instruments. This method is applicable to base modifications
that interfere with Watson–Crick base pairing (e.g. m1G37),
which account for 40–50% of the more than 100 base modi-
fications in databases. We demonstrate that such a base modi-
fication confers resistance to pairing with complementary
oligonucleotides and thus resistance to RNase H, which
cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA–DNA hybrid (18,19).
In contrast, RNA with the unmodified base is susceptible to
DNA hybridization and thus cleavage by RNase H. Previous
studies have used a similar approach to identify sites of 20-O-
ribose methylation in RNA molecules (20). Because the
RNase H-dependent purification is based on accessibility of
the base modification to hybridization, we tested its applica-
tion to both the m1G37 modification, located in the anticodon
loop, and the m1A58 modification, located in the more com-
plex tRNA tertiary core region. In both cases, we successfully
purified the tRNA species that contained the single base
modification away from the unmodified transcript, illustrating
the general utility of this method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The T7 transcripts of Methanococcus jannaschii tRNACys and
tRNAPro were made by in vitro transcription as described (21).
The His-tagged enzymes M.jannnaschii Trm5, Thermus
thermophilus Trm1 and yeast Trm10, were purified by a metal
affinity column, followed by monoS on an FPLC (15,22,23).
Concentrations of tRNAs were determined by ultraviolet (UV)
absorption, while those of enzymes were determined by the
Bradford assay. Oligo #1 and oligo #2 were chemically syn-
thesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, IA) and used
directly without further purification. To perform the RNase H
cleavage, a tRNA and its specific oligo (6 nmol each) were
mixed in a volume of 8 ml TE buffer [10 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA], heated to 85C and adjusted to
the RNase H buffer and 0.1 U of RNase H (Promega) to a final
volume of 10 ml. The reaction was incubated at 37C, while
aliquots of 3 ml were removed at 0, 20 and 40 min, and
analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 12% PAGE/7 M urea
on a BioRad MINI PROTEAN three Gel system. The gel was
run at 200 V in TBE for 50 min until bromophenol blue ran
to the bottom. The gel was stained by ethidium bromide and
visualized by UV. For gel shift analysis, modified and unmodi-
fied M.jannaschii tRNACys was 32P-labeled at the 30 end by the
CCA-adding enzyme (24), purified through a Centricon-20
devise (Princeton Separation), heat-denatured and annealed
with 3 mM oligo #1 in the RNase H buffer. The annealed
reactions were adjusted to 1· TBE, 5 mM MgCl2, 8% glycerol,
0.1% xylene cyanol and 0.1% bromophenol blue, and applied
to a native 12% PAGE (1· TBE and 10 mM MgCl2) and
electrophoresed at 100 V for 90 min at room temperature.
The gel was dried and analyzed by a phosphorimager.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Experimental design
For the m1G37 modification, we used tRNACys as the
substrate, while for the m1A58 modification, we used tRNAPro
(Figure 1A). Both tRNAs were derived from the archaeon
M.jannaschii, and both were GC rich relative to their bacterial
counterparts such that they offered an opportunity to test
sequences that were less accessible to complementary oligo-
nucleotides. The two tRNAs were synthesized as unmodified
transcripts by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro. Introduction of the
m1G37 modification was achieved by the homologous
M.jannaschii Trm5 (15), while that of the m1A58 modification
was achieved by the T.thermophilus Trm1 (23). Both enzymes
were expressed in E.coli and purified as His-tagged recombin-
ant proteins. The extent of reaction by each enzyme was quan-
tified by using [3H] AdoMet as the substrate and determined by
measuring acid-precipitable counts on filter pads.
The oligonucleotides that targeted m1G37 and m1A58 were
designed based on previous studies, which showed that the
DNA-directed RNaseH cleavage of the RNA strand can be
site-specific if the oligonucleotide consists of four deoxynuc-
leotides flanked by 20-O-methyl ribonucleotides on two sides
(20,25,26). In this design, the cleavage occurred at one of two
sites. The predominant site was the phosphodiester bond 50 to
the RNA residue that is base paired with the 50-most DNA
residue of the chimera (e.g. the large arrows in Figure 1B) (20),
while the minor site was the phosphodiester bond 30 to the
same RNA residue (the small arrows) (25). Either scenario
would lead to cleavage of the RNA strand. Thus, oligo #1 was
designed to complement tRNACys from A31 to U46, encom-
passing G37 in the anticodon loop, whereas oligo #2 was
designed to complement tRNAPro from C49 to C66, encom-
passing A58 in the T loop (Figure 1B), where it usually forms a
reverse Hoogstein base pair with U54. In both designs, the
primary cleavage on tRNA would be 30 to the site of base
modification. Oligos #1 and #2 were chemically synthesized
with a 20-O-methyl backbone, except for four deoxyribose
nucleotides that complemented the region of the respective
modification site.
Base modification protects RNA from RNase H
The ability of m1G37 and m1A58 to protect tRNA against
RNase H was examined (Figure 2). The Trm5-modified
tRNACys transcript was mixed with oligo #1 at a 1:1 molar
ratio, and the mixture was heat-denatured and annealed in the
presence of the RNase H buffer. E.coli RNase H was added to
the annealed hybrid and aliquots at various incubation times
(0, 20 and 40 min) were quenched with a dye solution con-
taining 8 M urea. In parallel, an unmodified tRNACys transcript
(without the Trm5 reaction) was treated similarly to provide a
comparison. Cleavage of tRNAs was analyzed by a denaturing
12% PAGE/7 M urea gel on a small apparatus and stained by
ethidium bromide. While the unmodified transcript was com-
pletely cleaved in 20 min, yielding two fragments of similar
lengths (37 and 38mers), a significant fraction of the modified
transcript showed resistance to RNase H up to 40 min
(Figure 2A). This fraction was 40% in 40 min, which was
similar to that determined from the plateau level of the m1G37
methylation reaction (37%). The cleaved fragments appeared
<50%, which was accounted for by the shorter sizes the frag-
ments that were weakly stained by ethidium bromide as evid-
enced in reactions of both unmodified and modified
transcripts. The cleavage-resistant fraction remained constant
in 40–60 min, even with addition of more RNase H (data not

shown), suggesting that the cleavage was complete and that
little unmodified transcript was left uncleaved.
Similarly, the Trm1-modified tRNAPro transcript was
hybridized to oligo #2 and subjected to the RNase H cleavage
analysis (Figure 2B). While the unmodified transcript was
cleaved within 20 min, the modified transcript remained lar-
gely intact. The cleavage of the unmodified transcript gener-
ated a 60mer fragment of the expected size (Figure 2B) and a
smaller 18mer, which migrated off the gel, leaving 5% full-
length tRNA that was cleaved upon further incubation (data
not shown). The cleavage-resistant fraction of the modified
transcript was 90%, similar to values (82%) measured by the
plateau methylation of the m1A58 reaction, indicating a more
efficient methylation reaction than the m1G37 reaction. In
both the Trm5 and Trm1 reactions, the corroboration between
the cleavage-resistant fraction and the methylation data was
confirmed over 5–8 independent experiments.
The RNase H cleavage reaction was also tested with the
m1G9 modification in M.jannaschii tRNAPro, which was at the
junction between the acceptor and D stems (Figure 1) and was
introduced by the Trm10-catalyzed reaction (22). As expected,
the control transcript was quantitatively cleaved to give a
69mer fragment, whereas the modified transcript was only
partially cleaved (data not shown). However, at longer incuba-
tion times both the 69mer fragment and the full-length modi-
fied transcript were cleaved at a secondary site, which
exhibited partial complementarity to the central portion of
the targeting oligonucleotide. This example emphasizes that

the specificity of cleavage requires that the site of modification
does not resemble other sequences in the same RNA.
Base modifications prevent RNA hybridization to
oligonucleotides
The ability of a base modification to protect tRNA against
RNase H cleavage could arise from inhibition of the cleavage
reaction by the non-hydrogen bonding base, or from failure of
the oligonucleotide to hybridize to the modified RNA, thus
preventing RNase H cleavage. To distinguish between these
two possibilities, complex formation between tRNACys and
oligo #1 was examined by gel electrophoresis under native
conditions, containing 5 mM MgCl2 (27). Here the m1G37-
modified tRNA was first purified away from the unmodified
transcript by the RNase H cleavage reaction described above.
The modified and unmodified transcripts were then labeled
with 32P by the CCA-adding enzyme, heat-denatured and
annealed with a molar excess of oligo #1, then analyzed by
gel electrophoresis (Figure 3). Clearly, in the reaction with the
unmodified tRNA, almost complete shift of the tRNA by the
presence of oligo #1 was observed (95%). In contrast, in the
reaction with the modified tRNA, only a small amount of the
shift was observed (5%), suggesting that either the hybrid
was unstable during the gel electrophoresis condition or that
the modified tRNA was not accessible to hybridization. A
separate experiment using 32P-labeled oligo #1 confirmed
that the oligo was unable to form a stable hybrid with the
modified transcript (data not shown). These experiments
demonstrated that a single base modification in a tRNA
effectively destabilized or prevented hybridization to its com-
plementary 17mer oligonucleotide. Earlier studies have also
shown that a single mismatch eliminates hybridization of
17mer primers to their target sequences (28,29).
The inability of the modified tRNA to form a stable hybrid
with the oligonucleotide provides a relevant rationale for why
the tRNA was resistant to RNase H cleavage. Based on the
analytical gel shown in Figure 3, the modified tRNA appeared
to migrate slightly faster than the unmodified tRNA, suggest-
ing the possibility of a conformational change. Recent
structural analysis of an m1G37-modified anticodon loop
has shown that the modification indeed rigidifies the RNA
by reducing molecular dynamics (30). This conformational
rigidity might further deter hybridization with oligo #1 and
explain the fractional shift in mobility of the modified tRNA.
Although Figure 3 illustrates the clear distinction between
the modified and unmodified tRNAs in their hybridization
behaviors, it should be emphasized that hybridization alone
is not sufficient to completely separate the two types of tRNA.
For one reason, the mobility shift of the hybrid is rather small
under the native gel conditions (Figure 3), suggesting that
separation of the unmodified transcript in the hybrid from
modified transcript by gel shift would be difficult, particularly
on a preparative gel with a scaled-up reaction. Second, while it
might be possible to develop a pull-down method to remove
the unmodified transcript by using a biotin-tagged oligonuc-
leotide to trap the hybrid to streptavidin beads, this method
will also remove some of the modified transcript. It is evident
from analysis of Figure 3 that the modified transcript showed
fractional hybridization to oligo #1.
The RNase H cleavage reaction following hybridization
provides the necessary step to completely separate the
modified from the unmodified transcript. Even if the modified
transcript has the ability to form a hybrid, regardless of the
stability, this hybrid is not a substrate for the RNase H
cleavage activity. In the recent crystal structure of the Bacillus
halodurans RNase H bound to an RNA/DNA hybrid (19), the
substrate specificity depends on direct interactions between the
enzyme active site that contacts the RNA strand of the RNA/
DNA hybrid. This enzyme uses the two-metal-ion catalysis for
the cleavage reaction (31). Two of the catalytic carboxylates
that coordinate the metal ions make hydrogen-bonds with two

20-OH groups immediately 50-to the scissile phosphate,
whereas two other catalytic residues contact the two 20-OH
groups 30 to the scissile phosphate. These contacts are made by
conserved residues of the active site and explain why cleavage
requires a minimum of four consecutive riboses, two on each
side of the scissile bond (32). Notably, our design of oliog-
nucleotides placed the modification in the middle of the 4 bp of
the RNA/DNA hybrid (Figure 1B). This is to eliminate the
base pair in the middle of the hybrid and to destroy the required
continuity of four 20-OH groups along the active site groove.
The mis-alignment of the 20-OH groups would perturb the
active site, thus providing a clear rationale for the lack of
RNase H cleavage activity.
The method developed here allows a general RNA
transcript containing a site-specific base modification to be
gel purified and separated from the unmodified transcript,
which is cleaved. The purified RNA is now suitable for invest-
igation in vitro to determine the function of the base modi-
fication. At present, the only other alternative is to prepare a
site-specifically modified RNA by chemical synthesis, which
is limited by the type of modification (30), the high cost of
synthesis, and the length of RNA. A compromise to the high
cost and length limitations is to synthesize smaller RNA frag-
ments containing modifications and use RNA or DNA ligase to
join them to unmodified RNAs (33,34). However, successful
ligation requires extensive investigation of conditions and may
not be efficient (Z. Li and Y.-M. Hou, unpublished data).
These drawbacks are not inherent to our method, which is
rapid and robust, versatile for modifications in highly structure
RNA, and has no length limitation. The only equipment
necessary for the method is a mini-gel apparatus that provides
separation of cleaved from uncleaved RNA species. In scaled-
up reactions, we routinely apply 5–10 nmols of RNA into one
lane of the mini-gel apparatus and use UV shadowing to
identify RNA bands. The modified RNA can then be eluted
from gel slices. The method requires custom synthesis of
complementary 20-O-methyl oligonucleotide, which is facile
and affordable by current technology.
Despite the multiple advantages, some critical points need
to be considered for application of this method. First, it
requires the availability of the requisite modification enzyme
and a base modification that disrupts conventional base pair-
ing. Because each modification is distinct in chemical nature
and its ability to disrupt base pairing, the condition of hybrid-
ization and RNase H cleavage reaction needs to be identified
for each. This is evident in Figure 2, where the m1G37
modification catalyzed by the Trm5 enzyme is less efficient
than the m1A58 modification catalyzed by the Trm1 enzyme.
Also, the m1G37-modified tRNA requires longer time (40–
60 min) to be cleared of the unmodified transcript than the
m1A58-modified tRNA (20–40 min). Second, the design of
oligonucleotides should take into account the position of the
modified base and length of flanking sequences. The general
principle is to design oligonucleotides that will place the modi-
fied base in the middle of the four RNA/DNA hybrid base pairs
as demonstrated here. The flanking sequences should be such
that oligonucleotides can form stable hybrids with
unmodified transcripts at 37C. This can be determined by
a heat-cool process, followed by gel shift analysis. We
suggest that 17mer is sufficient for GC rich sequences,
such as M.jannaschii tRNACys and tRNAPro, but that longer
oligonucleotides might be necessary for AU rich sequences.
Finally, the sequence of oligonucleotides should avoid ambi-
guity, such that hybridization can take place at only one site.
However, this may not be possible for all modifications, as
demonstrated by the example of the m1G9 modification.
