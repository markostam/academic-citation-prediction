Abstract
Genetic variation in DNA repairmay affect the clinical response
to cytotoxic therapies. We investigated the effect of six single
nucleotide polymorphisms of the RecQ1, RAD54L, XRCC2 , and
XRCC3 genes on overall survival of 378 patients with pancreatic
adenocarcinoma who were treated at University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center during February 1999 to October 2004
and were followed up to October 2005. Genotypes were
determined using the MassCode method. Survival was
determined from pathologic diagnosis to death. Patients
who were alive at the last follow-up evaluation were censored
at that time. Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox
regression were used to compare overall survival by geno-
types. A significant effect on survival of all patients was
observed for RecQ1 and RAD54L genes. The median survival
time was 19.2, 14.7, and 13.2 months for the RecQ1 159 AA, AC,
and CC genotypes, and 16.4, 13.3, and 10.3 months for RAD54L
157 CC, CT, and TT genotypes, respectively. A significantly
reduced survival was associated with the variant alleles of
XRCC2 R188H and XRCC3 A17893G in subgroup analysis.
When the four genes were analyzed in combination, an
increasing number of adverse alleles were associated with a
significantly decreased survival. Subgroup analyses have
shown that the genotype effect on survival was present among
patients without metastatic disease or among patients who
receive radiotherapy. These observations suggest that poly-
morphisms of genes involved in the repair of DNA double-
strand breaks significantly affect the clinical outcome of
patients with pancreatic cancer. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(6): 3323-30)
Introduction
DNA repair has been termed a double-edged sword because
decreased DNA repair may increase the risk of developing cancer
but improve survival in patients already diagnosed with cancer
when treated with DNA-damaging agents. Previous studies have
shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of nucleotide
excision repair genes affected clinical outcome in patients treated
with platinum-based therapy (1–5). Studies on the predictive and
prognostic role of other DNA repair genes and clinical outcome are
limited.
Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed at a late stage of the
disease and surgical intervention is not an option for the majority
of patients. Pancreatic tumors are highly aggressive and resistant to
most treatment. Gemcitabine and radiotherapy [X-ray therapy
(XRT)] are the current main therapeutic modalities for advanced
pancreatic cancer (6, 7). However, other than stage, it is not clear
what factors influence the clinical response to such treatment.
Gemcitabine is a radiosensitizer. Unlike other radiosensitizers,
which either increase radiation-induced DNA damage or decrease
the rate of DNA repair, gemcitabine neither increases double-strand
breaks nor decreases the rate of their repair (8). Gemcitabine
inhibits DNA synthesis via a process called masked chain
termination. After insertion of the drug into the DNA strand, one
or more nucleotide base pairs incorporate normally before the DNA
chain elongation is terminated. This process locks gemcitabine into
the DNA strand and prevents proofreading enzymes from detecting,
excising, and repairing the DNA lesion (9). Little is known about
DNA repair pathways that may alter cytotoxicity or radiosensitivity
with gemcitabine. Studies in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines
deficient in base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair,
homologous recombination repair, and nonhomologous end joining
showed similar sensitivity to gemcitabine as their parental repair-
proficient cells, indicating that these pathways are most likely
incapable of modulating the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine (10).
However, another study has shown that gemcitabine induces
radiosensitization in base excision repair–deficient cells but not in
homologous recombination repair–deficient cells (11). Gemcitabine
also induces substantial enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of
mitomycin C in homologous recombination repair–proficient cells
but not in homologous recombination repair–deficient cells (11).
These observations suggest that homologous recombination repair
may play an important role in gemcitabine-mediated cell killing.
For tumor cells, the most important factor influencing radio-
sensitivity is the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes (12). Other factors that may also alter radiosensitivity include
cell cycle regulation, detoxification and stress response, and DNA
repair (13). Double-strand breaks in DNA are the most common
type of radiation lesions that lead to mammalian cell death.
Homologous recombination repair is a major pathway of double-
strand breaks repair in all eukaryotes (14) and gemcitabine-
mediated radiosensitization seems to depend on the homologous
recombination repair mechanism (11). To test the hypothesis
that genetic variations in homologous recombination repair affect
clinical response to gemcitabine/XRT therapy and, in turn, the
prognosis of pancreatic cancer, we have selected six common
SNPs of four homologous recombination repair genes (i.e., RecQ1,
RAD54L, X-ray repair complementing (XRCC)-2 and XRCC3) and
examined their association with overall survival of patients with
pancreatic cancer.
RecQ1 is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family, which is
involved in recombination and in various types of DNA repair,
including mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and direct

repair (15). Three of the five human RecQ genes (i.e., BLM, WRN ,
and RecQ4) have been associated with genetic disorders of Bloom,
Werner, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively, all of
which are characterized by predisposition to malignancies and
chromosome instability (16). RecQ helicases play multiple roles in
DNA recombination and repair, S-phase checkpoint, and telomere
maintenance, and thus are considered the caretakers of the
genome and tumor suppressors (17, 18). The biological significance
of the remaining two RecQ genes, RecQ1 and RecQ5 , remains
unknown. It has been suggested that RecQ1 and RecQ5 genes
maybe indispensable for cell viability and may contribute to cancer
susceptibility in general (17, 18). RecQ1 gene is located on
chromosome 12p12, the same region harboring the K-ras gene.
RecQ1 is known to be able to unwind a diverse set of DNA
substrates (19, 20), to catalyze efficient strand annealing between
complementary ssDNA molecules (20), and to interact with
several important DNA repair factors required for DNA mismatch
repair (21). Thus, it is possible that this gene plays a role in
genetic predisposition to cancer and in response to cytotoxic
therapy. We examined two of the most prevalent SNPs of this
gene [i.e., RecQ1 3V-untranslated region A157C (rs#13035) and IVS3
A-86G (rs#4987276)] in this study. Neither of the two polymorphisms
has previously been studied in association with disease risk or
functional significance.
RAD54L belongs to the DEAD-like helicase superfamily (22) and
it plays a role in homologous recombination repair of DNA double-
strand breaks (23). The binding of this protein to double-strand
DNA induces a DNA topological change, which is thought to
facilitate homologous DNA pairing and stimulate DNA recombi-
nation (24). RAD54L gene is located at chromosome 1p32. A
synonymous C157T (also known as 2290C/T, A730A, rs#1048771)
polymorphism of the RAD54L gene has been associated with
increased risk for meningioma (25). Whether this gene contributes
to cellular radiosensitivity is unknown.
XRCC2 and XRCC3 are members of the RecA/Rad51-related
protein family that participate in homologous recombination
repair (26, 27). XRCC2 is a core component in the homologous
recombination repair pathway and it forms a heterodimer with
Rad51-like protein (28). High levels of aneuploidy, chromosome
rearrangement, and haploinsufficiency have been observed in
XRCC2 gene knockout cells (29). XRCC3 has a remarkable diverse
set of functions and acts both early and late in the homologous
recombination repair pathway (30). A rare microsatellite polymor-
phism in this gene was found to be associated with clinical
radiosensitivity in cancer patients (31). XRCC2 and XRCC3 genes
are located on chromosomes 7q36.1 and 14q32.3, respectively. We
examined three polymorphisms of the two genes [i.e., XRCC2
R188H (exon 3 G442A, rs#3218536), XRCC3 A17893G (IVS7-14,
rs#1799796), and XRCC3 T241M (exon 8 C-53T, rs#861539)]. The
XRCC2 R188H variant allele has been associated with reduced cell
survival after mitomycin C exposure (32). The XRCC3 A17893G
polymorphism resides in the intron region and the functional
significance of this SNP has not been investigated. The XRCC3
T241M variant allele has been found to have a mild effect on cell
survival after radiation exposure (33).
Materials and Methods
Patient recruitment. A total of 378 patients with pathologically
confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of all stages were recruited
prospectively at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
(Houston, TX) between January 1999 and October 2004. These individuals
participated in a larger ongoing molecular epidemiologic study in which
demographic (age, sex, and race) and risk factor information (smoking
status, medical history, family history of cancer, and exposures) were
collected by personal interview and a blood sample was collected for
genotyping at the time of enrollment. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of M.D. Anderson.
For this analysis, all 378 patients were treated at M.D. Anderson between
January 1999 and October 2004 and were followed up to October 20, 2005.
We chose October 2004 as the last month of eligibility to have at least 12
months of follow-up for all patients. We chose patients treated at our
institute because information about patients treated elsewhere was often
sparse, and sometimes patients treated outside were not given standard
treatments or observed in standard fashions.
Clinical information was collected by reviewing the medical records of
consenting patients. This included date of pathologic diagnosis, treatment
received before evaluation at M.D. Anderson, clinical tumor stage (localized,
locally advanced, and metastatic), performance status at first visit to M.D.
Anderson, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) values (units/mL) at
diagnosis, surgical procedure and date, pre- and postoperative chemother-
apy regimen and radiation, and date of death or last follow-up.
DNA extraction and genotyping. Whole blood was collected in
heparinized tubes from patients at the time of enrollment into an on-
going molecular epidemiology study examining pancreatic cancer risk. DNA
was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using the Qiagen DNA Isolation
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Polymorphisms were detected using the
MassCode technique by BioServe (Laurel, MD). About 10% of the samples
were analyzed in duplicate and discrepancies were seen in <0.1% of the
samples. Those with discordant results from two analyses were excluded
from the final data analysis. The no call rate was 6% for RecQ1 A159C and
<4% for the remaining five polymorphisms.
Survival measurements. Our primary end point was overall survival
from the time of pathologic diagnosis to date of death or last follow-up for
all patients. Patients who were not deceased were censored at the last date
they were known to be alive based on the date of last contact. Median
follow-up time was computed among censored observations only. The
minimum follow-up time is 12 months and the maximum follow-up time is
60 months. Dates of death were obtained and cross-checked using at least
one of the following three methods: Social Security Death Index, inpatient
medical records, and the M.D. Anderson tumor registry. Date of death was
obtained most often through the Social Security Death Index, but in unusual
instances in which the patient’s date of death was not reported there (either
due to death within 3 months of the data collection or some other reason),
date of death was obtained through at least one of the other sources listed.
This date was verified by inpatient records and/or confirmation with the
patient’s primary care physician and/or family.
Statistical methods. The distribution of genotypes was compared by
racial groups as well as by tumor stage using Pearson m2 tests. Tests for
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were conducted by goodness-of-fit m2 test to
compare the observed genotype frequencies with the expected genotype
frequencies with 1 degree of freedom. Linkage disequilibrium of the two
polymorphic variants of the RecQ1 and XRCC3 genes was measured by using
the SNPAlyze software (Dynacom, Inc., Mobara, Japan). The association
between overall survival and each SNP was estimated using the method of
Kaplan and Meier and assessed using the log-rank test. The combined
genotype effect on survival was examined by the number of at-risk alleles.
Hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated using both
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression models. The
multivariatemodels included all factors that showed a significant association
with overall survival in univariate analysis. All statistical tests were conducted
using the SPSS software version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).
Results
Patient characteristics and overall survival. The median age
of the 378 patients in this study was 63 years (range, 38-89 years);
13.2% were <50, 27.5% were 51 to 60, 33.9% were 61 to 70, and

25.47% were >70 years of age. Caucasians, Hispanics, and African
Americans constituted 87.8%, 5.8%, and 5.0% of the study
population, respectively. The male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1. There
were 271 (72%) deaths among the 378 cases. The median survival
time (MST) was 15.4 months. The median follow-up time was 24.2
months for the living patients. Age, race, sex, cigarette smoking,
and history of diabetes did not show any significant effect on
overall survival (Table 1).
At diagnosis, there were 107 localized resectable tumors, 185
locally advanced (including 65 potentially or borderline resectable
tumors), and 86 metastatic tumors. The MST was 24.5, 15.4, and
9.8 months for patients with localized, locally advanced, and
metastatic disease, respectively (P < 0.001, log-rank test). As
expected, both performance status and serum CA19-9 levels at
diagnosis were significant predictors of survival in this patient
population. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status grade 0 and 1 had better survival than those
with grade 2 and 3. Patients with a CA19-9 value of >1,000 units/mL
had at least 6 months shorter survival than those with a value of
<1,000 units/mL. There were 143 patients who received tumor
resection surgery and these patients survived much longer than
those who did not receive tumor resection. In this patient series,
6.2%, 3.8%, and 6.2% patients received chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
and tumor resection surgery before their first visit to M.D.
Anderson. During the entire disease process, 29 (7.7%) patients
received gemcitabine alone; 53 (14%) received gemcitabine-based
chemoradiation; 86 (22.8%) received gemcitabine-based chemo-
radiation plus other type of chemotherapy; 33 (8.7%) received
5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation; 72 (19%) received
5-FU-based chemoradiation plus other type of chemotherapy;

95 (25.1%) received combined chemotherapy without radiation;
and 11 (2.9%) received no cytotoxic therapy. Overall, 84.4% of the
patients received gemcitabine, 70.4% received radiation to the
tumor, 53.4% received cisplatin (or oxaliplatin), and 43.1% received
5-FU (or capecitabine). In addition, f20.6% of patients received
investigational therapy, such as bevacuzumab, celecoxib, a-IFN,
and others. Because of the heterogeneity of the patient population
and the small number of patients, treatment regimens during the
entire disease process were collapsed into three groups [i.e.,
chemotherapy alone, 5-FU-based chemoradiation (5-FU/XRT), and
gemcitabine-based chemoradiation (gemcitabine/XRT)]. The 11
patients who did not receive any cytotoxic therapy were excluded
from the treatment subgroup analyses. Patients who received
gemcitabine/XRT or 5-FU/XRT did significantly better than those
received chemotherapy alone.
Genotype and survival. The six SNPs were successfully
amplified in 93.6% to 98.2% of the patients. No homozygous AA
genotype was detected for the RecQ1 A-86G SNP. Genotype
frequencies for all six SNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (m2 = 0.21-2.9, P > 0.1). There was a significant
difference in the racial distribution of the RAD54L and XRCC3
T241M genotypes. For RAD54L , African Americans had a higher
frequency (94.7%) of the CC wild-type than Caucasians (77.2%)
and Hispanics (81.0%; P = 0.03, m2 test). The frequency of the
XRCC3 CC wild-type was 68.4% in African Americans compared
with 36.3% in Caucasians and 42.9% in Hispanics (P = 0.046).
There were no significant differences in the genotype distributions
by age, sex, disease stage, and surgical status (data not shown).
The two SNPs of the RecQ1 gene are in linkage disequilibrium
with a DVvalue of 0.90 (P = 0.02). The two SNPs of he XRCC3 gene
are in complete linkage disequilibrium and the DV value is 0.99
(P < 0.001; Table 2).
A significant effect of the RecQ1 A159C and RAD54L C157T
genotype on overall survival was observed. The MST was 19.2, 14.7,
and 13.2 months for the RecQ1 A157C AA, AC, and CC genotypes,
and 16.4, 13.3, and 10.3 months for the RAD54L CC, CT, and TT
genotypes, respectively. The RecQ1 159 CC and RAD54L 157 TT
genotypes remained as significant predictors for survival in Cox

95% CI, 2.58-44.7) because of the extremely low frequency of the AA
genotype (n = 2 only). Neither of the two XRCC3 gene poly-
morphisms showed any significant effect on survival.
Subgroup analysis by stage and surgery. Because disease
stage and curative surgery are known to be the most significant
predictors of survival, we have separated the patients into three
groups in the subgroup analysis; i.e., patients with localized and
locally advanced tumor and achieved tumor resection (Surgical
group, n = 143), patients with localized and locally advanced
tumors and did not achieve tumor resection (nonsurgical group,
n = 149), and patients with metastatic tumors (metastatic group,
n = 86). The MST for the surgical, nonsurgical, and metastatic
groups was 29.8, 11.7, and 9.8 months, respectively (P < 0.001).
The effect of RecQ1 and RAD54L gene on survival was clearly
seen in patients with localized disease (i.e., the combined
surgical and nonsurgical groups; Fig. 1) but was completely
absent in patients with metastatic disease (data not shown). The
XRCC2 R188H variant allele showed a significant association
with poorer survival in nonsurgical patients only. When the
RecQ1, RAD54L , and XRCC2 SNPs were analyzed in combination,
a significantly reduced survival was associated with an increasing
number of adverse alleles in both surgical and nonsurgical
patients (Table 3).
Subgroup analysis by treatment. Among patients with
localized disease (the surgical and nonsurgical groups), there are
45 patients who did not receive radiotherapy during the entire
course of the disease. There are 138 and 101 patients who received
gemcitabine-based and 5-FU-based chemoradiation, respectively.
The MST was 13.7, 23.4, and 18.7 months for patients who received
chemotherapy alone, gemcitabine/XRT, and 5-FU/XRT, respectively
(P = 0.003). No significant genotype effect was observed in patients
who received chemotherapy alone. The gemcitabine group
consisted more of surgical patients (55.8% versus 47.5%; P = 0.21,
m2 test) and less of locally advanced disease (54.37% versus 70.3%;
P = 0.01, m2 test) than the 5-FU group. The significant effects of
RecQ1 and RAD54L genes on survival were observed among
patients who received gemcitabine-based chemoradiation whereas
the effects of XRCC2 and XRCC3 genes were observed in patients
who received 5-FU-based chemoradiation only. When the four
genes were analyzed in combination, a significantly decreased
survival was observed as the number of adverse alleles increased in
both gemcitabine/XRT and 5-FU/XRT groups (Table 4).
Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the effect of six SNPs of four
homologous recombination repair genes (i.e., RecQ1, RAD54L,
XRCC2 , and XRCC3) on overall survival of patients with pancreatic
adenocarcinoma. We showed that the variant alleles of these genes,
independently or jointly, are associated with significantly decreased
overall survival. The genotype effect was present in patients with
localized disease or in patients who received radiotherapy but
absent in patients with metastatic disease or in patients who did
not receive radiotherapy. These observations for the first time
showed the significant effect of homologous recombination repair
genes on cancer patient survival.
Among the four genes examined in the current study, the
RecQ1 and RAD54L genes showed a significant effect on survival
when all 378 patients were included in the analysis. The
homozygous variant allele of either gene conferred an average
6-month shorter survival compared with the wild-type. The
frequency of the homozygous variant allele was 19.2% and 1.9%

for the RecQ1 A159C and RAD54L C157T, respectively. Both
variant alleles remained as significant predictor for survival after
adjusting for all known significant clinical predictors. These data
support an important role of the RecQ1 and RAD54L genes in
pancreatic tumor progression or response to clinical therapy.
RecQ1 belongs to the DNA helicase RecQ gene family including
the Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund-Thomson causative genes
WRN, BLM , and RecQ4 . Previous studies have shown that under
BLM-impaired conditions, RecQ1 acted as a backup mechanism
for the helicase function in cell viability (34). Recent studies have
also shown that RecQ1 may play a role in DNA strand break
repair and mismatch repair (21, 22). The RecQ1 A159C SNP is
located on the 3V-untranslated region of the gene and it exerted
its effect in a dominant inheritance mode (i.e., one variant allele
is required to alter the chance of survival). It is possible that this
SNP may affect the translation efficiency and mRNA stability of
the gene. If the variant allele confers a higher activity of the
RecQ1 protein, it may repair the therapy-related DNA damages
more efficiently and, in turn, a poorer clinical response. RAD54L
is also a DNA helicase and it is known to play a role in repairing
DNA double-strand breaks (35, 36). RAD54L has been proposed as
a candidate tumor suppressor gene in tumors bearing a
nonrandom deletion of chromosome 1p32 (25, 37, 38). The
RAD54L C157T SNP has previously been associated with
increased risk of meningiomas (17). The current study found
that the RAD54L C157T variant allele was associated with a
significantly poorer survival in patients treated with chemo-
radiation. This effect was perhaps directly related to the repair
efficiency of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. How-
ever, the C157T SNP is a silent polymorphism (Ala730Ala) that
does not induce any amino acid change. We can only speculate
that the observed effect on survival was related to linkage
disequilibrium of this SNP with other SNPs of the same gene or
with other genes on the same chromosome. The same possibility
that the RecQ1 A159C SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with other
SNPs of the gene or with other genes cannot be excluded.
Whereas haplotype analysis and in vitro experiments will be
needed to clarify the exact role of these two SNPs in response to
genotoxic stress, the association between these two polymorphic
variants and cancer patient survival should be verified in other
patient populations. If confirmed, it may have a significant effect
on the clinical management of cancer patients.
XRCC2 and XRCC3 are Rad51 paralogues that are expressed in
mitotically growing cells and are thought to play mediating roles
in homologous recombination repair, although their precise
functions remain unclear. Loss of either XRCC2 or XRCC3 was
sufficient to sensitize cells to agents that induce DNA double-
strand breaks (39). The current study observed a poorer survival of
patients carrying the heterozygous and homozygous variant alleles
of XRCC2 R188H or the homozygous mutant allele of XRCC3 17893,
which suggests that these mutant alleles may affect the repair
efficiency of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and, in

turn, clinical outcome. Because most of the significant associations
with survival was observed in subgroup analysis and the study
power is limited by the small sample size, these observations need
to be interpreted with caution.
Among patients with metastatic disease, none of the genotypes
or any other factors significantly affected survival. Individuals with
metastatic disease may already have too many genetic alterations
driving tumor progression or treatment resistance so that any
subtle effect of genotypes to alter DNA repair capacity is
overwhelmed.
Although our data could not definitely discriminate whether the
genetic effect on survival was mediated through response to
treatment or by affecting tumor aggressiveness, some preliminary
observations suggest that the effect of these genotypes was
probably related to radiation responsiveness. For example, the
distribution of the SNPs was not significantly different by disease
stage and the genetic effects on overall survival were observed in
patients treated with radiotherapy but not in patients who did not
receive radiotherapy. Whether or not the survival differences by
genotypes truly reflect a radiation-related outcome may be best
tested through studies that employ prospective study designs. If
proven, modulation of these enzymes may serve as a therapeutic
target to increase tumor cell radiosensitivity. The current study did
not find evidence to support a specific role of any of these tested
genes in gemcitabine response although both RecQ1 and RAD54L
genes seemed to have a stronger effect on survival in patients who
received gemcitabine-based therapy than in those who received
5-FU-based therapy. Because the former group had more early-
stage patients and surgical patients than the latter group, the
current observations cannot be accurately interpreted. Whether or
not RecQ1 and RAD54L play a specific role in the repair of
gemcitabine-induced DNA damage needs to be tested in a clinical
trial with a well-defined patient population.
The current study observed a significantly reduced survival
associated with an increasing number of adverse genotypes.
Because DNA repair is a complex process, it takes many proteins
to act in concert to maintain cell viability and genome integrity.
Each single SNP of the low penetrance genes may have a weak
effect at the functional level but the combined effect of several
genes may have significant clinical value in predicting response to
therapy and prognosis. The strength of this study is a large sample
size and adequate statistical power. The limitation of the study is
the heterogeneity of the patients, which makes data interpretation
more difficult. Some subgroup analyses were conducted to

overcome this problem but the small sample size in each group
may increase the chance of false-positive result. It is important to
confirm these observations in other patient populations. If
confirmed, such information may provide opportunities for
discovery of novel therapeutic targets and genetic profiles that
can direct the choice of therapy and predict the treatment
tolerance, response, and overall outcome (40).
